He had, it\r\nwas true, been formulating his ideas and arguments for several\r\ndecades—since his round-the-world _Beagle_ voyage of 1831-1836. These\r\nideas and arguments had been slow to take definitive shape; Darwin had\r\nnurtured and reworked them, amassing evidence for what he projected to\r\nbe a weighty magnum opus. Although he had shared his developing\r\nevolutionary speculations with his closest professional colleagues,\r\nDarwin was reluctant to publish them on several grounds. He was aware\r\nthat his theory of evolution by natural selection (or descent with\r\nmodification) was complex, that it rested on vast but not\r\nincontrovertible evidence, and that the chain of his reasoning was not\r\nuniformly strong. Further, his conclusions challenged not only the\r\nscientific assumptions of many fellow specialists but also the\r\ntheological convictions of a much wider circle of fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, Darwin did not feel quite ready to expose his cherished theory\r\nto the harsh light of public scrutiny. In the introduction to the\r\n_Origin_ he confessed that although his work on evolution by natural\r\nselection was “nearly finished,” he would need “two or three more years\r\nto complete it.” The _ Origin_ was, he suggested, merely a stopgap, a\r\nschematic “abstract” of a much longer and more fully supported treatise\r\nyet to come. He had been moved to preview his labors in this way, he\r\nexplained, because his health was “far from strong” and, perhaps more\r\nimportantly, because Alfred Russel Wallace, a younger naturalist\r\nworking in isolation in southeast Asia, had sent a paper to the Linnean\r\nSociety of London in which he “arrived at almost exactly the same\r\ngeneral conclusions that I have on the origin of species.” If Darwin\r\nhad not gone public with his theory at this point, he would have risked\r\nlosing credit for the work of many years.\r\n\r\nAs its reception showed immediately and has continued to show, the\r\n_Origin_ benefited from the succinctness imposed by circumstances.\r\nDarwin himself may have appreciated this point; at any rate, he never\r\nproduced the massive treatise, although he repeatedly issued revised\r\neditions of the _ Origin._ But he did not abandon his intention to\r\nbuttress his initial schematic presentation with additional evidence.\r\nIn the course of the next two decades he published several full-length\r\nelaborations of topics summarily discussed in the _Origin: The\r\nVariation of Animals and Plants under Domestication; The Descent of\r\nMan, and Selection in Relation to Sex;_ and _The Expression of the\r\nEmotions in Man and Animals._ In addition to fleshing out the _Origin,_\r\nthese subsequent studies bolstered its arguments and responded to\r\nquestions raised by critical readers, especially pragmatic questions\r\nabout the way that descent with modification actually operated.\r\n\r\nIn _The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,_ which\r\nappeared first in 1868 and in a revised edition in 1875, Darwin\r\ndeveloped a theme to which he had accorded great rhetorical and\r\nevidentiary significance. He had begun the _ Origin_ with a description\r\nof artificial selection as practiced by farmers, stock breeders, and\r\npet fanciers, thus using a reassuringly homely example—one recognizable\r\nby the general public as well as by members of the scientific\r\ncommunity—to introduce the most innovative component of his\r\nevolutionary theory. In addition, domesticated animals and plants,\r\nbecause they were numerous and available for constant observation,\r\nprovided a readily available body of evidence.\r\n\r\nReassuring as it was, the analogy between natural and artificial\r\nselection was far from perfect. The point of Darwin’s analogy was to\r\nmake the idea of natural selection seem plausible by characterizing it\r\nas a grander version of a well-known process while emphasizing its\r\nefficiency and shaping power. He noted, for example, that some of the\r\nprize birds bred by London pigeon fanciers diverged so strikingly in\r\nsize, plumage, beak shape, flying technique, vocalizations. bone\r\nstructure, and many other attributes, that if they had been presented\r\nto an ornithologist as wild specimens, they would unquestionably have\r\nbeen considered to represent distinct species, perhaps even distinct\r\ngenera. Darwin argued that if the relatively brief and constrained\r\nselective efforts of human breeders had produced such impressive\r\nresults, it was likely that the more protracted and thorough-going\r\nefforts of nature would work still more efficaciously.\r\n\r\nBut as Darwin acknowledged, there were some fairly obvious reasons why\r\nthe two processes might diverge. The superior power of natural\r\nselection—“Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature\r\n. . . can act on . . . the whole machinery of life. Man selects only\r\nfor his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends”\r\n(_Origin,_ chap. 5)—might constitute a difference of kind rather than\r\nof degree, as might the much greater stretches of time available for\r\nnatural selection. Further, although the mechanism of the two processes\r\nappeared superficially similar, their outcomes tended to be rather\r\ndifferent. Natural selection produced a constantly increasing and\r\ndiversifying variety of forms; it never reversed or exactly repeated\r\nitself. Anyone familiar with artificial selection would have realized\r\nthat, although new breeds were constantly being developed and although\r\nneither improved wheat nor improved cattle showed any tendency to\r\nrevert to the condition of their aboriginal wild ancestors, the strains\r\nproduced by human selection were neither as prolific nor as durable as\r\nthose produced by nature. Indeed, the animals and plants celebrated as\r\nthe noblest achievements of the breeder’s art were especially liable to\r\ndelicacy and infertility. Highly bred strains, long isolated from\r\nothers of their species to preserve their genealogical purity, far from\r\nserving as a springboard for further variation, often had to be\r\nrevivified with infusions of less-rarefied blood. Yet any relaxation of\r\nreproductive boundaries threatened subsidence into the common run of\r\nconspecifics.\r\n\r\nDarwin firmly connected _Variation_ to the _Origin_ by devoting its\r\nintroduction to an overview of his theory of evolution by natural\r\nselection. In particular, the two volumes of _Variation,_ cumbersomely\r\norganized and packed with zoological and botanical detail, addressed\r\nsome of the difficulties inherent in the attractive but paradoxical\r\nanalogy between natural selection and artificial selection. For\r\nselection of any sort to operate, diversity already had to exist. With\r\nwild populations living under natural conditions, however, diversity\r\nwas difficult to discern. It was widely believed that a heightened\r\npropensity to vary (at least in ways obvious to human observers) was\r\none of the few general characteristics that differentiated domestic\r\nanimals as a group from their wild relatives. This point was\r\nconventionally illustrated with reference to coat color and design.\r\nAmerican bison, for example, were, on the whole, brown, and all\r\nBurchell’s zebras shared similar black and white stripes. A single herd\r\nof either _Bos tauras_ or _Equus caballus_ (domestic cattle or horses),\r\non the other hand, could display colors ranging from white through\r\nyellow, red, and brown to black, as well as a variety of spotted and\r\nblotched patterns.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate that such populations spontaneously produced\r\nsufficient variation to support artificial selection, Darwin devoted\r\nmost of the first volume of _ Variation_ to a species-by-species survey\r\nof domesticated plants and animals. He began with the dog, the breeds\r\nof which differed so greatly in size, shape, disposition, talents, and\r\nevery other characteristic that Darwin attributed its exemplary\r\nplasticity to its derivation from several different species of wild\r\ncanines. Domestic cats, on the other hand, differed relatively little\r\nfrom one another, at least, their variation tended to be individual,\r\nrather than consolidated into breeds. Darwin attributed this to the\r\nminimal influence exerted by cat owners over the mating behavior of\r\ntheir animals, so that, alone among fully domesticated animals, cats\r\ncould not be said to have undergone a genuine process of artificial\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nFarmyard ungulates, however, had all proved more susceptible to human\r\nmanipulation, whether through the gradual enhancement of inherent\r\ntendencies, such as the relatively early maturation that distinguished\r\nshorthorn cattle, or through the preservation of spontaneously arising\r\nmonstrosities, such as the short, broad foreheads and protruding lower\r\njaws of the niata cattle of South America, the bulldogs of the bovine\r\nworld. Among animals, fancy pigeons, with their short generations,\r\ndevoted breeders, and lack of any pragmatic constraints on their\r\nextravagant deformations, provided Darwin with his most abundant\r\nmaterial. He allotted less space to his survey of domesticated plants,\r\nalthough, with the exception of trees, they tended to he much shorter\r\nlived and more variable even than pigeons. For example, as Darwin\r\npointed out, a single long-cultivated species—_Brassica oleracea,_ the\r\nordinary cabbage—had given rise to strains as distinctive as Brussels\r\nsprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, and kohl-rabi.\r\n\r\nDarwin crammed in so much information of this sort that, in order to\r\nconfine _Variation_ to two volumes of manageable size, less crucial\r\nevidence was relegated to a smaller typeface. And so compendious was\r\nhis survey of domesticates that he felt constrained to deny that it was\r\nintended to he an exhaustive catalog. After all, many such catalogs,\r\ndevoted merely to the accumulation of species- or breed-specific data,\r\nexisted already; Darwin cited them generously in his footnotes. The\r\nmaterial included in _Variation_ had been chosen to fulfill a more\r\nfocused argumentative purpose. Darwin’s theory of descent with\r\nmodification required something further than the simple demonstration\r\nthat abundant variation existed among domesticated animals and plants.\r\nThe accumulated experience of naturalists and breeders offered no clear\r\nexplanation of the causes of variation; indeed, no consensus existed on\r\nthis issue. Variation under domestication was frequently attributed to\r\naccidental external influences, especially climate and food. But\r\nenvironmentally induced variation was not of much use to Darwin.\r\nInstead, he sought evidence not only that the tendency to vary was\r\ninherent in domesticated animals and plants but also that specific\r\nvariations were inherited.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Darwin’s wealth of detail in _ Variation_\r\ndisproportionately featured strong—as well as puzzling, problematic, or\r\neven questionable—versions of inheritance, in addition to the\r\nunsurprising, if still not completely understood, likelihood that\r\nchildren would resemble their parents. For example, he devoted an\r\nentire chapter to what he termed “atavism” or “reversion”—that is, the\r\ntendency for offspring to manifest traits apparently derived from their\r\ngrandparents, collateral relations, or even remote ancestors, rather\r\nthan from their mothers or their fathers. The existence of this\r\ntendency in the lineages of individuals, he argued, incontrovertibly\r\ndemonstrated the fact of heritability; and in an extended or\r\nexaggerated version it also demonstrated evolutionary relations between\r\nspecies. Thus, many breeds of domesticated chickens revealed their\r\nultimate ancestry by producing occasional sports with the red and\r\norange plumage of the original _Callus bankiva,_ or jungle fowl.\r\n\r\nLike many other naturalists of his time, Darwin was receptive to the\r\nidea of telegony, also known as “the influence of the previous sire.”\r\nHe retailed the famous story of Lord Morton’s mare, a chestnut of\r\nseven-eighths Arabian blood, whose first foal had been sired by a\r\nquagga (a now-extinct relative of the zebra) her owner was attempting\r\nto domesticate. It was not surprising that the young hybrid faintly\r\nechoed his father’s stripes, but the fact that her next two foals, both\r\nsired by a black Arabian horse, also seemed to resemble the quagga in\r\nthis regard, was more remarkable. Darwin pointed out that atavism\r\noffered one possible explanation of this phenomenon—infant horses and\r\ndonkeys often showed evanescent striping, which might indicate the\r\npattern of their ancient shared progenitor—but he was also drawn to the\r\nnotion that the first male to impregnate a female left some permanent,\r\nheritable trace of himself behind. He offered analogous examples from\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, where the pollen of related varieties of apples,\r\ncorn, or orchids, could not only produce hybrid offspring but\r\noccasionally also physically alter the reproductive tract of the\r\nfemale. Plants also, and more regularly, demonstrated a kind of\r\nvariability that could arise independently of sexual reproduction, such\r\nas “bud variation,” whereby what Darwin called a “monstrosity” might\r\nappear on a single branch or flower and then be transmitted, sexually\r\nor asexually, to future generations.\r\n\r\nAs he documented the profusion of variation among domesticated animals\r\nand plants, and the tendency of organisms to transmit these variations\r\ndown the generations, Darwin did more than demonstrate that there was\r\nample grist for the mill of natural selection. He also addressed the\r\nmost serious weakness in the argument of the _Origin._ Despite the\r\nincompleteness of the fossil record, plenty of evidence suggested that\r\nevolution had taken place; indeed the idea of evolution had been\r\ncurrent in one form or another for a century before 1859. Darwin’s\r\nexplanation of the way that natural selection should operate was also\r\nwidely persuasive. The competitive metaphors with which he\r\ncharacterized it, especially the “struggle for life” prominently\r\nfeatured in the _Origin_’s subtitle, fit well with Victorian\r\nunderstandings about how things worked in the human arenas of industry,\r\ncommerce, and geopolitics. There was, however, a problem that troubled\r\nthose inclined to sympathize with Darwin’s reasoning as well as those\r\ninclined to reject it. The efficacy of natural selection, like that of\r\nartificial selection, depended on the inheritance of particular traits.\r\nBut before the modern understanding of genetics became available, no\r\nsatisfactory mechanism had been adduced to explain this phenomenon. No\r\nconsensus yet existed about the way that sexual reproduction worked, so\r\nthere was also disagreement about which characteristics were inherited\r\nand which were the result of environment, and what could he contributed\r\nby the male as opposed to the female parent, let alone why offspring\r\nsometimes resembled a grandparent or some more distant relative rather\r\nthan their parents. The special difficulty of accounting for the sudden\r\nemergence of monstrosities, or even less dramatically novel traits, led\r\nDarwin, in later editions of the _Origin_ as well as in _Variation,_ to\r\nbecome increasingly receptive to the notion that characteristics\r\nacquired by one generation might he inherited by the next.\r\n\r\nIn the penultimate chapter of _Variation,_ Darwin attempted to\r\nstrengthen the weak link in his chain of argument by proposing a\r\nmechanism for inheritance. He called his theory “pangenesis,” and he\r\nclaimed that it explained not only ordinary inheritance—the influence\r\nof parents on their children—but also reversion, telegony, the\r\nregeneration of amputated limbs in some kinds of animals, the\r\ninheritance of acquired characteristics, and the relationship between\r\nsexual and asexual modes of reproduction and inheritance. The operation\r\nof pangenesis depended on the posited existence of unobservable units\r\nthat Darwin called “gemmules,” tiny granules that were thrown off by\r\nindividual cells and then circulated through the body. They had,\r\nhowever, an affinity for each other, which led to their aggregation in\r\nthe reproductive organs or in parthenogenetic buds. They could remain\r\nlatent for years, until an organism reached a certain stage of\r\ndevelopment, or for generations, until they encountered other gemmules\r\nto which they bore some special relationship. In this way a\r\nlong-dormant greatgrandparental gemmule might suddenly manifest itself\r\nin a child. Since gemmules could he altered by environmental\r\ninfluences, they could convert acquired characteristics into the stuff\r\nof heredity. And since they were vulnerable to error, they could\r\noccasionally make mistakes, causing organs, such as limbs or tails or\r\neven heads, to develop in inappropriate numbers or in the wrong places.\r\n\r\nIt has doubtless been fortunate for Darwin’s reputation that his theory\r\nof pangenesis is not as well remembered as his theory of evolution by\r\nnatural selection. As vague in detail as it was ambitious and\r\ncomprehensive in scope, it was unpersuasive at the time and has since\r\nbeen proven completely wrong. But like _Variation_ as a whole, which\r\nsimilarly illustrated the limitations of its author as well as his\r\nstrengths, pangenesis does not therefore lack interest or significance.\r\nDespite recent excellent and well-appreciated studies of his entire\r\nlife and extended _oeuvre_ (Janet Browne, _Charles Darwin: Voyaging_\r\n[New York: Knopf, 1995] and Adrian Desmond and James Moore, _Darwin_\r\n[London: Michael Joseph, 1991], Darwin is known primarily as the author\r\nof the _Origin,_ which is unrepresentative in its economy of structure,\r\nargument, and evidence, as well as on account of its historical\r\nnotoriety. Its enforced streamlining has helped to preserve the\r\n_Origin_’s accessibility, but its relative paucity of examples was\r\nparticularly uncharacteristic of Darwin. _Variation,_ with its\r\naccumulation of evidence about everything from the webbing between\r\ndogs’ toes to the weight of gooseberries, was much more typical; in\r\naddition, it placed Darwin firmly—indeed, irretrievably—within his\r\ntime, rather than in an achronological limbo reserved for intellectual\r\nheroes. As a graduate student from the People’s Republic of China told\r\nme several years ago, after having participated in a seminar that read\r\nexcerpts from _Variation_ and _The Expression of the Emotions,_ if the\r\nleaders of his government knew that Darwin had written such books, he\r\nwould not be officially admired.\r\n\r\nIn science as in politics the victors tend to write the history books.\r\nAs a result, the record of the past is edited, intentionally or\r\nunintentionally, so that it focuses mainly on the precursors of\r\ncontemporary orthodoxy. Such a focus may accurately represent the\r\ngenealogy of modem ideas, but it almost inevitably misrepresents the\r\nhistorical experience of their progenitors. Viewed without the benefit\r\nof hindsight, the marketplace of Victorian ideas seemed much more\r\ncompetitive than it does to us. Even the powerful, persuasive, and\r\nultimately triumphant theory of evolution by natural selection required\r\nnot only defense, but repeated buttressing and revision. _ Variation_\r\nshowed Darwin hard at work on this rearguard action, using the\r\nmaterials he had at hand—for the most part, homely details about the\r\ndomesticated animals and plants with which his audience was most\r\nfamiliar. His information was gleaned from the observations of\r\nfanciers, breeders, and amateur naturalists, as well as from the\r\ntreatises of those on the cutting edge of zoology and botany. As\r\nhindsight narrows the historical spotlight, it imposes its own sense of\r\nhierarchy on the preoccupations of the past. But Darwin was interested\r\nin all of these topics, valued all of these sources, and belonged, to a\r\ngreater or lesser extent, to all of these communities.\r\n\r\nThe author of _Variation_ was a Victorian country gentleman, a lover of\r\ndogs and horses, a breeder of pigeons and peas. He was also, and\r\nequally, the author of _On the Origin of Species._\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years which have elapsed since the publication in 1868\r\nof the first edition of this Work, I have continued to attend to the\r\nsame subjects, as far as lay in my power; and I have thus accumulated a\r\nlarge body of additional facts, chiefly through the kindness of many\r\ncorrespondents. Of these facts I have been able here to use only those\r\nwhich seemed to me the more important. I have omitted some statements,\r\nand corrected some errors, the discovery of which I owe to my\r\nreviewers. Many additional references have been given. The eleventh\r\nchapter, and that on Pangenesis, are those which have been most\r\naltered, parts having been remodelled; but I will give a list of the\r\nmore important alterations for the sake of those who may possess the\r\nfirst edition of this book.\r\n\r\n          TABLE OF PRINCIPAL ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS IN SECOND\r\n          EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              First\r\n              Edition\r\n              Vol. I\r\n\r\n              Second\r\n              Edition\r\n              Vol. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n              First\r\n\r\n              Edition\r\n\r\n              Vol. I\r\n            \r\n               \r\n            \r\n              Second\r\n\r\n              Edition\r\n\r\n              Vol. I\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                                               \r\n_Page_     _Chapter_      \r\n34     I     Dr. Burt Wilder’s observations on the brains\r\n          of different breeds of the Dog.\r\n38     I     Degeneracy of Dogs imported into\r\n          Guinea.\r\n51     II     Difference in the number of lumbar\r\n          vertebræ in the races or species of the Horse.\r\n102     III     Hairy appendages to the throats of\r\n          Goats.\r\n162     V     Sexual differences in colour in the domestic\r\n          Pigeon.\r\n217     VI     Movements like those of the Tumbler-pigeon,\r\n          caused by injury to the brain.\r\n290     VIII     Additional facts with respect to the\r\n          Black-shouldered Peacock.\r\n296     VIII     Ancient selection of Gold-fish in\r\n          China.\r\n314     IX     Major Hallett’s ‘Pedigree Wheat.’\r\n326     IX     The common radish descended from _Raphanus\r\n          raphanistrum._\r\n374     XI     Several additional cases of bud-variation\r\n          given.\r\n396     XI     An abstract of all the cases recently\r\n          published of graft-hybrids in the potato, together with a\r\n          general summary on graft-hybridisation.\r\n399     XI     An erroneous statement with respect to the\r\n          pollen of the date-palm affecting the fruit of the\r\n          Chamærops omitted.\r\n400     XI     New cases of the direct action of pollen on\r\n          the mother-plant.\r\n404     XI     Additional and remarkable instances of the\r\n          actions of the male parent on the future progeny of the\r\n          female.\r\nVol.II            \r\n14     XII     An erroneous statement corrected, with\r\n          respect to the regrowth of supernumerary digits after\r\n          amputation.\r\n23     XII     Additional facts with respect to the\r\n          inherited effects of circumcision.\r\n23     XII     Dr. Brown-Séquard on the inherited\r\n          effects of operations on the Guinea-pig.\r\n24     XII     Other cases of inherited mutilations.\r\n      Vol. II      \r\n43     XIII     An additional case of reversion due to a\r\n          cross.\r\n72     XIV     Inheritance as limited by sex.\r\n105     XVI     Two varieties of maize which cannot be\r\n          crossed.\r\n120     XVII     Some additional facts on the advantages of\r\n          cross-breeding in animals.\r\n123     XVII     Discussion on the effects of the close\r\n          interbreeding in the case of man.\r\n135\r\n\r\n          to\r\n\r\n          141      \r\n\r\n          XVII\r\n\r\n                Additional cases of plants sterile with\r\n          pollen from the same plant.\r\n149     XVIII     Mr. Sclater on the infertility of animals\r\n          under confinement.\r\n152     XVIII     The Aperea a distinct species from the\r\n          Guinea-pig.\r\n230     XXI     Prof. Jäger on hawks killing\r\n          light-coloured pigeons.\r\n273     XXIII     Prof. Wisemann on the effects of isolation\r\n          in the development of species.\r\n281     XXIII     The direct action of the conditions of life\r\n          in causing variation.\r\n317     XXIV     Mr. Romanes on rudimentary parts.\r\n324\r\n\r\n          to\r\n\r\n          328      \r\n\r\n          XXV\r\n\r\n                Some additional cases of correlated\r\n          variability.\r\n339     XXVI     On Geoffrey St. Hilaire’s law of _“soi\r\n          pour soi.”_\r\n357\r\n\r\n          to\r\n\r\n          404      \r\n\r\n          XXVII\r\n\r\n                The chapter on Pangenesis has been largely\r\n          altered and re-modelled; but the essential principles remain\r\n          the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this work is not to describe all the many races of\r\nanimals which have been domesticated by man, and of the plants which\r\nhave been cultivated by him; even if I possessed the requisite\r\nknowledge, so gigantic an undertaking would be here superfluous. It is\r\nmy intention to give under the head of each species only such facts as\r\nI have been able to collect or observe, showing the amount and nature\r\nof the changes which animals and plants have undergone whilst under\r\nman’s dominion, or which bear on the general principles of variation.\r\nIn one case alone, namely in that of the domestic pigeon, I will\r\ndescribe fully all the chief races, their history, the amount and\r\nnature of their differences, and the probable steps by which they have\r\nbeen formed. I have selected this case, because, as we shall hereafter\r\nsee, the materials are better than in any other; and one case fully\r\ndescribed will in fact illustrate all others. But I shall also describe\r\ndomesticated rabbits, fowls, and ducks, with considerable fulness.\r\n\r\nThe subjects discussed in this volume are so connected that it is not a\r\nlittle difficult to decide how they can be best arranged. I have\r\ndetermined in the first part to give, under the heads of the various\r\nanimals and plants, a large body of facts, some of which may at first\r\nappear but little related to our subject, and to devote the latter part\r\nto general discussions. Whenever I have found it necessary to give\r\nnumerous details, in support of any proposition or conclusion, small\r\ntype has been used. The reader will, I think, find this plan a\r\nconvenience, for, if he does not doubt the conclusion or care about the\r\ndetails, he can easily pass them over; yet I may be permitted to say\r\nthat some of the discussions thus printed deserve attention, at least\r\nfrom the professed naturalist.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to those who have read nothing about Natural\r\nSelection, if I here give a brief sketch of the whole subject and of\r\nits bearing on the origin of species.[1] This is the more desirable, as\r\nit is impossible in the present work to avoid many allusions to\r\nquestions which will be fully discussed in future volumes.\r\n\r\nFrom a remote period, in all parts of the world, man has subjected many\r\nanimals and plants to domestication or culture. Man has no power of\r\naltering the absolute conditions of life; he cannot change the climate\r\nof any country; he adds no new element to the soil; but he can remove\r\nan animal or plant from one climate or soil to another, and give it\r\nfood on which it did not subsist in its natural state. It is an error\r\nto speak of man “tampering with nature” and causing variability. If a\r\nman drops a piece of iron into sulphuric acid, it cannot be said\r\nstrictly that he makes the sulphate of iron, he only allows their\r\nelective affinities to come into play. If organic beings had not\r\npossessed an inherent tendency to vary, man could have done nothing.[2]\r\nHe unintentionally exposes his animals and plants to various conditions\r\nof life, and variability supervenes, which he cannot even prevent or\r\ncheck. Consider the simple case of a plant which has been cultivated\r\nduring a long time in its native country, and which consequently has\r\nnot been subjected to any change of climate. It has been protected to a\r\ncertain extent from the competing roots of plants of other kinds; it\r\nhas generally been grown in manured soil; but probably not richer than\r\nthat of many an alluvial flat; and lastly, it has been exposed to\r\nchanges in its conditions, being grown sometimes in one district and\r\nsometimes in another, in different soils. Under such circumstances,\r\nscarcely a plant can be named, though cultivated in the rudest manner,\r\nwhich has not given birth to several varieties. It can hardly be\r\nmaintained that during the many changes which this earth has undergone,\r\nand during the natural migrations of plants from one land or island to\r\nanother, tenanted by different species, that such plants will not often\r\nhave been subjected to changes in their conditions analogous to those\r\nwhich almost inevitably cause cultivated plants to vary. No doubt man\r\nselects varying individuals, sows their seeds, and again selects their\r\nvarying offspring. But the initial variation on which man works, and\r\nwithout which he can do nothing, is caused by slight changes in the\r\nconditions of life, which must often have occurred under nature. Man,\r\ntherefore, may be said to have been trying an experiment on a gigantic\r\nscale; and it is an experiment which nature during the long lapse of\r\ntime has incessantly tried. Hence it follows that the principles of\r\ndomestication are important for us. The main result is that organic\r\nbeings thus treated have varied largely, and the variations have been\r\ninherited. This has apparently been one chief cause of the belief long\r\nheld by some few naturalists that species in a state of nature undergo\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nI shall in this volume treat, as fully as my materials permit, the\r\nwhole subject of variation under domestication. We may thus hope to\r\nobtain some light, little though it be, on the causes of\r\nvariability,—on the laws which govern it, such as the direct action of\r\nclimate and food, the effects of use and disuse, and of correlation of\r\ngrowth,—and on the amount of change to which domesticated organisms are\r\nliable. We shall learn something of the laws of inheritance, of the\r\neffects of crossing different breeds, and on that sterility which often\r\nsupervenes when organic beings are removed from their natural\r\nconditions of life, and likewise when they are too closely interbred.\r\nDuring this investigation we shall see that the principle of Selection\r\nis highly important. Although man does not cause variability and cannot\r\neven prevent it, he can select, preserve, and accumulate the variations\r\ngiven to him by the hand of nature almost in any way which he chooses;\r\nand thus he can certainly produce a great result. Selection may be\r\nfollowed either methodically and intentionally, or unconsciously and\r\nunintentionally. Man may select and preserve each successive variation,\r\nwith the distinct intention of improving and altering a breed, in\r\naccordance with a preconceived idea; and by thus adding up variations,\r\noften so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye, he has\r\neffected wonderful changes and improvements. It can, also, be clearly\r\nshown that man, without any intention or thought of improving the\r\nbreed, by preserving in each successive generation the individuals\r\nwhich he prizes most, and by destroying the worthless individuals,\r\nslowly, though surely, induces great changes. As the will of man thus\r\ncomes into play, we can understand how it is that domesticated breeds\r\nshow adaptation to his wants and pleasures. We can further understand\r\nhow it is that domestic races of animals and cultivated races of plants\r\noften exhibit an abnormal character, as compared with natural species;\r\nfor they have been modified not for their own benefit, but for that of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn another work I shall discuss, if time and health permit, the\r\nvariability of organic beings in a state of nature; namely, the\r\nindividual differences presented by animals and plants, and those\r\nslightly greater and generally inherited differences which are ranked\r\nby naturalists as varieties or geographical races. We shall see how\r\ndifficult, or rather how impossible it often is, to distinguish between\r\nraces and sub-species, as the less well-marked forms have sometimes\r\nbeen denominated; and again between sub-species and true species. I\r\nshall further attempt to show that it is the common and widely ranging,\r\nor, as they may be called, the dominant species, which most frequently\r\nvary; and that it is the large and flourishing genera which include the\r\ngreatest number of varying species. Varieties, as we shall see, may\r\njustly be called incipient species.\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged, granting that organic beings in a state of nature\r\npresent some varieties,—that their organisation is in some slight\r\ndegree plastic; granting that many animals and plants have varied\r\ngreatly under domestication, and that man by his power of selection has\r\ngone on accumulating such variations until he has made strongly marked\r\nand firmly inherited races; granting all this, how, it may be asked,\r\nhave species arisen in a state of nature? The differences between\r\nnatural varieties are slight; whereas the differences are considerable\r\nbetween the species of the same genus, and great between the species of\r\ndistinct genera. How do these lesser differences become augmented into\r\nthe greater difference? How do varieties, or as I have called them\r\nincipient species, become converted into true and well-defined species?\r\nHow has each new species been adapted to the surrounding physical\r\nconditions, and to the other forms of life on which it in any way\r\ndepends? We see on every side of us innumerable adaptations and\r\ncontrivances, which have justly excited the highest admiration of every\r\nobserver. There is, for instance, a fly (Cecidomyia)[3] which deposits\r\nits eggs within the stamens of a Scrophularia, and secretes a poison\r\nwhich produces a gall, on which the larva feeds; but there is another\r\ninsect (Misocampus) which deposits its eggs within the body of the\r\nlarva within the gall, and is thus nourished by its living prey; so\r\nthat here a hymenopterous insect depends on a dipterous insect, and\r\nthis depends on its power of producing a monstrous growth in a\r\nparticular organ of a particular plant. So it is, in a more or less\r\nplainly marked manner, in thousands and tens of thousands of cases,\r\nwith the lowest as well as with the highest productions of nature.\r\n\r\nThis problem of the conversion of varieties into species,—that is, the\r\naugmentation of the slight differences characteristic of varieties into\r\nthe greater differences characteristic of species and genera, including\r\nthe admirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and\r\ninorganic conditions of life,—has been briefly treated in my ‘Origin of\r\nSpecies.’ It was there shown that all organic beings, without\r\nexception, tend to increase at so high a ratio, that no district, no\r\nstation, not even the whole surface of the land or the whole ocean,\r\nwould hold the progeny of a single pair after a certain number of\r\ngenerations. The inevitable result is an ever-recurrent Struggle for\r\nExistence. It has truly been said that all nature is at war; the\r\nstrongest ultimately prevail, the weakest fail; and we well know that\r\nmyriads of forms have disappeared from the face of the earth. If then\r\norganic beings in a state of nature vary even in a slight degree, owing\r\nto changes in the surrounding conditions, of which we have abundant\r\ngeological evidence, or from any other cause; if, in the long course of\r\nages, inheritable variations ever arise in any way advantageous to any\r\nbeing under its excessively complex and changing relations of life; and\r\nit would be a strange fact if beneficial variations did never arise,\r\nseeing how many have arisen which man has taken advantage of for his\r\nown profit or pleasure; if then these contingencies ever occur, and I\r\ndo not see how the probability of their occurrence can be doubted, then\r\nthe severe and often-recurrent struggle for existence will determine\r\nthat those variations, however slight, which are favourable shall be\r\npreserved or selected, and those which are unfavourable shall be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThis preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which\r\npossess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have\r\ncalled Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed\r\nthe same idea by the Survival of the Fittest. The term “natural\r\nselection” is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply\r\nconscious choice; but this will be disregarded after a little\r\nfamiliarity. No one objects to chemists speaking of “elective\r\naffinity;” and certainly an acid has no more choice in combining with a\r\nbase, than the conditions of life have in determining whether or not a\r\nnew form be selected or preserved. The term is so far a good one as it\r\nbrings into connection the production of domestic races by man’s power\r\nof selection, and the natural preservation of varieties and species in\r\na state of nature. For brevity sake I sometimes speak of natural\r\nselection as an intelligent power;—in the same way as astronomers speak\r\nof the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets, or\r\nas agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of\r\nselection. In the one case, as in the other, selection does nothing\r\nwithout variability, and this depends in some manner on the action of\r\nthe surrounding circumstances on the organism. I have, also, often\r\npersonified the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid\r\nthis ambiguity; but I mean by nature only the aggregate action and\r\nproduct of many natural laws,—and by laws only the ascertained sequence\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown from many facts that the largest amount of life can\r\nbe supported on each area, by great diversification or divergence in\r\nthe structure and constitution of its inhabitants. We have, also, seen\r\nthat the continued production of new forms through natural selection,\r\nwhich implies that each new variety has some advantage over others,\r\ninevitably leads to the extermination of the older and less improved\r\nforms. These latter are almost necessarily intermediate in structure,\r\nas well as in descent, between the last-produced forms and their\r\noriginal parent-species. Now, if we suppose a species to produce two or\r\nmore varieties, and these in the course of time to produce other\r\nvarieties, the principal of good being derived from diversification of\r\nstructure will generally lead to the preservation of the most divergent\r\nvarieties; thus the lesser differences characteristic of varieties come\r\nto be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species,\r\nand, by the extermination of the older intermediate forms, new species\r\nend by being distinctly defined objects. Thus, also, we shall see how\r\nit is that organic beings can be classed by what is called a natural\r\nmethod in distinct groups—species under genera, and genera under\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nAs all the inhabitants of each country may be said, owing to their high\r\nrate of reproduction, to be striving to increase in numbers; as each\r\nform comes into competition with many other forms in the struggle for\r\nlife,—for destroy any one and its place will be seized by others; as\r\nevery part of the organisation occasionally varies in some slight\r\ndegree, and as natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation\r\nof variations which are advantageous under the excessively complex\r\nconditions to which each being is exposed, no limit exists to the\r\nnumber, singularity, and perfection of the contrivances and\r\nco-adaptations which may thus be produced. An animal or a plant may\r\nthus slowly become related in its structure and habits in the most\r\nintricate manner to many other animals and plants, and to the physical\r\nconditions of its home. Variations in the organisation will in some\r\ncases be aided by habit, or by the use and disuse of parts, and they\r\nwill be governed by the direct action of the surrounding physical\r\nconditions and by correlation of growth.\r\n\r\nOn the principles here briefly sketched out, there is no innate or\r\nnecessary tendency in each being to its own advancement in the scale of\r\norganisation. We are almost compelled to look at the specialisation or\r\ndifferentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best\r\nor even sole standard of advancement; for by such division of labour\r\neach function of body and mind is better performed. And as natural\r\nselection acts exclusively through the preservation of profitable\r\nmodifications of structure, and as the conditions of life in each area\r\ngenerally become more and more complex from the increasing number of\r\ndifferent forms which inhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring\r\na more and more perfect structure, we may confidently believe, that, on\r\nthe whole, organisation advances. Nevertheless a very simple form\r\nfitted for very simple conditions of life might remain for indefinite\r\nages unaltered or unimproved; for what would it profit an infusorial\r\nanimalcule, for instance, or an intestinal worm, to become highly\r\norganised? Members of a high group might even become, and this\r\napparently has often occurred, fitted for simpler conditions of life;\r\nand in this case natural selection would tend to simplify or degrade\r\nthe organisation, for complicated mechanism for simple actions would be\r\nuseless or even disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nThe arguments opposed to the theory of Natural Selection, have been\r\ndiscussed in my ‘Origin of Species,’ as far as the size of that work\r\npermitted, under the following heads: the difficulty in understanding\r\nhow very simple organs have been converted by small and graduated steps\r\ninto highly perfect and complex organs; the marvellous facts of\r\nInstinct; the whole question of Hybridity; and, lastly, the absence in\r\nour known geological formations of innumerable links connecting all\r\nallied species. Although some of these difficulties are of great\r\nweight, we shall see that many of them are explicable on the theory of\r\nnatural selection, and are otherwise inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIn scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis,\r\nand if it explains various large and independent classes of facts it\r\nrises to the rank of a well-grounded theory. The undulations of the\r\nether and even its existence are hypothetical, yet every one now admits\r\nthe undulatory theory of light. The principle of natural selection may\r\nbe looked at as a mere hypothesis, but rendered in some degree probable\r\nby what we positively know of the variability of organic beings in a\r\nstate of nature,—by what we positively know of the struggle for\r\nexistence, and the consequent almost inevitable preservation of\r\nfavourable variations,—and from the analogical formation of domestic\r\nraces. Now this hypothesis may be tested,—and this seems to me the only\r\nfair and legitimate manner of considering the whole question,—by trying\r\nwhether it explains several large and independent classes of facts;\r\nsuch as the geological succession of organic beings, their distribution\r\nin past and present times, and their mutual affinities and homologies.\r\nIf the principle of natural selection does explain these and other\r\nlarge bodies of facts, it ought to be received. On the ordinary view of\r\neach species having been independently created, we gain no scientific\r\nexplanation of any one of these facts. We can only say that it has so\r\npleased the Creator to command that the past and present inhabitants of\r\nthe world should appear in a certain order and in certain areas; that\r\nHe has impressed on them the most extraordinary resemblances, and has\r\nclassed them in groups subordinate to groups. But by such statements we\r\ngain no new knowledge; we do not connect together facts and laws; we\r\nexplain nothing.\r\n\r\nIt was the consideration of such large groups of facts as these which\r\nfirst led me to take up the present subject. When I visited during the\r\nvoyage of H.M.S. _Beagle,_ the Galapagos Archipelago, situated in the\r\nPacific Ocean about 500 miles from South America, I found myself\r\nsurrounded by peculiar species of birds, reptiles, and plants, existing\r\nnowhere else in the world. Yet they nearly all bore an American stamp.\r\nIn the song of the mocking-thrush, in the harsh cry of the\r\ncarrion-hawk, in the great candlestick-like opuntias, I clearly\r\nperceived the neighbourhood of America, though the islands were\r\nseparated by so many miles of ocean from the mainland, and differed\r\nmuch in their geological constitution and climate. Still more\r\nsurprising was the fact that most of the inhabitants of each separate\r\nisland in this small archipelago were specifically different, though\r\nmost closely related to each other. The archipelago, with its\r\ninnumerable craters and bare streams of lava, appeared to be of recent\r\norigin; and thus I fancied myself brought near to the very act of\r\ncreation. I often asked myself how these many peculiar animals and\r\nplants had been produced: the simplest answer seemed to be that the\r\ninhabitants of the several islands had descended from each other,\r\nundergoing modification in the course of their descent; and that all\r\nthe inhabitants of the archipelago were descended from those of the\r\nnearest land, namely America, whence colonists would naturally have\r\nbeen derived. But it long remained to me an inexplicable problem how\r\nthe necessary degree of modification could have been effected, and it\r\nwould have thus remained for ever, had I not studied domestic\r\nproductions, and thus acquired a just idea of the power of Selection.\r\nAs soon as I had fully realised this idea, I saw, on reading Malthus on\r\nPopulation, that Natural Selection was the inevitable result of the\r\nrapid increase of all organic beings; for I was prepared to appreciate\r\nthe struggle for existence by having long studied the habits of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nBefore visiting the Galapagos I had collected many animals whilst\r\ntravelling from north to south on both sides of America, and\r\neverywhere, under conditions of life as different as it is possible to\r\nconceive, American forms were met with—species replacing species of the\r\nsame peculiar genera. Thus it was when the Cordilleras were ascended,\r\nor the thick tropical forests penetrated, or the fresh waters of\r\nAmerica searched. Subsequently I visited other countries, which in all\r\ntheir conditions of life were incomparably more like parts of South\r\nAmerica, than the different parts of that continent are to each other;\r\nyet in these countries, as in Australia or Southern Africa, the\r\ntraveller cannot fail to be struck with the entire difference of their\r\nproductions. Again the reflection was forced on me that community of\r\ndescent from the early inhabitants of South America would alone explain\r\nthe wide prevalence of American types throughout that immense area.\r\n\r\nTo exhume with one’s own hands the bones of extinct and gigantic\r\nquadrupeds brings the whole question of the succession of species\r\nvividly before one’s mind; and I found in South America great pieces of\r\ntesselated armour exactly like, but on a magnificent scale, that\r\ncovering the pigmy armadillo; I had found great teeth like those of the\r\nliving sloth, and bones like those of the cavy. An analogous succession\r\nof allied forms had been previously observed in Australia. Here then we\r\nsee the prevalence, as if by descent, in time as in space, of the same\r\ntypes in the same areas; and in neither the case does the similarity of\r\nthe conditions by any means seem sufficient to account for the\r\nsimilarity of the forms of life. It is notorious that the fossil\r\nremains of closely consecutive formations are closely allied in\r\nstructure, and we can at once understand the fact if they are closely\r\nallied by descent. The succession of the many distinct species of the\r\nsame genus throughout the long series of geological formations seems to\r\nhave been unbroken or continuous. New species come in gradually one by\r\none. Ancient and extinct forms of life are often intermediate in\r\ncharacter, like the words of a dead language with respect to its\r\nseveral offshoots or living tongues. All these facts seemed to me to\r\npoint to descent with modification as the means of production of new\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable past and present inhabitants of the world are connected\r\ntogether by the most singular and complex affinities, and can be\r\nclassed in groups under groups, in the same manner as varieties can be\r\nclassed under species and sub-varieties under varieties, but with much\r\nhigher grades of difference. These complex affinities and the rules for\r\nclassification, receive a rational explanation on the theory of\r\ndescent, combined with the principle of natural selection, which\r\nentails divergence of character and the extinction of intermediate\r\nforms. How inexplicable is the similar pattern of the hand of a man,\r\nthe foot of a dog, the wing of a bat, the flipper of a seal, on the\r\ndoctrine of independent acts of creation! how simply explained on the\r\nprinciple of the natural selection of successive slight variations in\r\nthe diverging descendants from a single progenitor! So it is with\r\ncertain parts or organs in the same individual animal or plant, for\r\ninstance, the jaws and legs of a crab, or the petals, stamens, and\r\npistils of a flower. During the many changes to which in the course of\r\ntime organic beings have been subjected, certain organs or parts have\r\noccasionally become at first of little use and ultimately superfluous;\r\nand the retention of such parts in a rudimentary and useless condition\r\nis intelligible on the theory of descent. It can be shown that\r\nmodifications of structure are generally inherited by the offspring at\r\nthe same age at which each successive variation appeared in the\r\nparents; it can further be shown that variations do not commonly\r\nsupervene at a very early period of embryonic growth, and on these two\r\nprinciples we can understand that most wonderful fact in the whole\r\ncircuit of natural history, namely, the close similarity of the embryos\r\nwithin the same great class—for instance, those of mammals, birds,\r\nreptiles, and fish.\r\n\r\nIt is the consideration and explanation of such facts as these which\r\nhas convinced me that the theory of descent with modification by means\r\nof natural selection is in the main true. These facts have as yet\r\nreceived no explanation on the theory of independent Creation; they\r\ncannot be grouped together under one point of view, but each has to be\r\nconsidered as an ultimate fact. As the first origin of life on this\r\nearth, as well as the continued life of each individual, is at present\r\nquite beyond the scope of science, I do not wish to lay much stress on\r\nthe greater simplicity of the view of a few forms or of only one form\r\nhaving been originally created, instead of innumerable miraculous\r\ncreations having been necessary at innumerable periods; though this\r\nmore simple view accords well with Maupertuis’s philosophical axiom of\r\n“least action.”\r\n\r\nIn considering how far the theory of natural selection may be extended,\r\n—that is, in determining from how many progenitors the inhabitants of\r\nthe world have descended,—we may conclude that at least all the members\r\nof the same class have descended from a single ancestor. A number of\r\norganic beings are included in the same class, because they present,\r\nindependently of their habits of life, the same fundamental type of\r\nstructure, and because they graduate into each other. Moreover, members\r\nof the same class can in most cases be shown to be closely alike at an\r\nearly embryonic age. These facts can be explained on the belief of\r\ntheir descent from a common form; therefore it may be safely admitted\r\nthat all the members of the same class are descended from one\r\nprogenitor. But as the members of quite distinct classes have something\r\nin common in structure and much in common in constitution, analogy\r\nwould lead us one step further, and to infer as probable that all\r\nliving creatures are descended from a single prototype.\r\n\r\nI hope that the reader will pause before coming to any final and\r\nhostile conclusion on the theory of natural selection. The reader may\r\nconsult my ‘Origin of Species’ for a general sketch of the whole\r\nsubject; but in that work he has to take many statements on trust. In\r\nconsidering the theory of natural selection, he will assuredly meet\r\nwith weighty difficulties, but these difficulties relate chiefly to\r\nsubjects—such as the degree of perfection of the geological record, the\r\nmeans of distribution, the possibility of transitions in organs,\r\netc.—on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant\r\nwe are. If we are much more ignorant than is generally supposed, most\r\nof these difficulties wholly disappear. Let the reader reflect on the\r\ndifficulty of looking at whole classes of facts from a new point of\r\nview. Let him observe how slowly, but surely, the noble views of Lyell\r\non the gradual changes now in progress on the earth’s surface have been\r\naccepted as sufficient to account for all that we see in its past\r\nhistory. The present action of natural selection may seem more or less\r\nprobable; but I believe in the truth of the theory, because it\r\ncollects, under one point of view, and gives a rational explanation of,\r\nmany apparently independent classes of facts.[4]\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] To any one who has attentively read my ‘Origin of Species’ this\r\n Introduction will be superfluous. As I stated in that work that I\r\n should soon publish the facts on which the conclusions given in it\r\n were founded, I here beg permission to remark that the great delay in\r\n publishing this first work has been caused by continued ill-health.\r\n\r\n [2] M. Pouchet has recently (‘Plurality of Races,’ Eng. Translat.,\r\n 1864, p. 83, etc.) insisted that variation under domestication throws\r\n no light on the natural modification of species.

Without such aid I could have effected little. I\r\n have repeatedly applied for information and specimens to foreigners,\r\n and to British merchants and officers of the Government residing in\r\n distant lands, and, with the rarest exceptions, I have received\r\n prompt, open-handed, and valuable assistance.

DOMESTIC DOGS AND CATS.\r\n\r\nANCIENT VARIETIES OF THE DOG—RESEMBLANCE OF DOMESTIC DOGS IN VARIOUS\r\nCOUNTRIES TO NATIVE CANINE SPECIES—ANIMALS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH MAN AT\r\nFIRST FEARLESS—DOGS RESEMBLING WOLVES AND JACKALS—HABIT OF BARKING\r\nACQUIRED AND LOST—FERAL DOGS—TAN-COLOURED EYE-SPOTS—PERIOD OF\r\nGESTATION—OFFENSIVE ODOUR—FERTILITY OF THE RACES WHEN\r\nCROSSED—DIFFERENCES IN THE SEVERAL RACES IN PART DUE TO DESCENT FROM\r\nDISTINCT SPECIES—DIFFERENCES IN THE SKULL AND TEETH—DIFFERENCES IN THE\r\nBODY, IN CONSTITUTION—FEW IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN FIXED BY\r\nSELECTION—DIRECT ACTION OF CLIMATE—WATER-DOGS WITH PALMATED\r\nFEET—HISTORY OF THE CHANGES WHICH CERTAIN ENGLISH RACES OF THE DOG HAVE\r\nGRADUALLY UNDERGONE THROUGH SELECTION—EXTINCTION OF THE LESS IMPROVED\r\nSUB-BREEDS.\r\n\r\nCATS, CROSSED WITH SEVERAL SPECIES—DIFFERENT BREEDS FOUND ONLY IN\r\nSEPARATED COUNTRIES—DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE—FERAL\r\nCATS—INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first and chief point of interest in this chapter is, whether\r\n    the numerous domesticated varieties of the dog have descended from\r\n    a single wild species, or from several. Some authors believe that\r\n    all have descended from the wolf, or from the jackal, or from an\r\n    unknown and extinct species. Others again believe, and this of late\r\n    has been the favourite tenet, that they have descended from several\r\n    species, extinct and recent, more or less commingled together. We\r\n    shall probably never be able to ascertain their origin with\r\n    certainty. Palæontology[1] does not throw much light on the\r\n    question, owing, on the one hand, to the close similarity of the\r\n    skulls of extinct as well as living wolves and jackals, and owing,\r\n    on the other hand, to the great dissimilarity of the skulls of the\r\n    several breeds of the domestic dogs. It seems, however, that\r\n    remains have been found in the later tertiary deposits more like\r\n    those of a large dog than of a wolf, which favours the belief of De\r\n    Blainville that our dogs are the descendants of a single extinct\r\n    species. On the other hand, some authors go so far as to assert\r\n    that every chief domestic breed must have had its wild prototype.\r\n    This latter view is extremely improbable: it allows nothing for\r\n    variation; it passes over the almost monstrous character of some of\r\n    the breeds; and it almost necessarily assumes that a large number\r\n    of species have become extinct since man domesticated the dog;\r\n    whereas we plainly see that wild members of the dog-family are\r\n    extirpated by human agency with much difficulty; even so recently\r\n    as 1710 the wolf existed in so small an island as Ireland.\r\n\r\n    The reasons which have led various authors to infer that our dogs\r\n    have descended from more than one wild species are as follows.[2]\r\n    Firstly, the great difference between the several breeds; but this\r\n    will appear of comparatively little weight, after we shall have\r\n    seen how great are the differences between the several races of\r\n    various domesticated animals which certainly have descended from a\r\n    single parent-form. Secondly, the more important fact, that, at the\r\n    most anciently known historical periods, several breeds of the dog\r\n    existed, very unlike each other, and closely resembling or\r\n    identical with breeds still alive.\r\n\r\n    We will briefly run back through the historical records. The\r\n    materials are remarkably deficient between the fourteenth century\r\n    and the Roman classical period.[3] At this latter period various\r\n    breeds, namely hounds, house-dogs, lapdogs, etc, existed; but, as\r\n    Dr. Walther has remarked, it is impossible to recognise the greater\r\n    number with any certainty. Youatt, however, gives a drawing of a\r\n    beautiful sculpture of two greyhound puppies from the Villa of\r\n    Antoninus. On an Assyrian monument, about 640 B.C., an enormous\r\n    mastiff[4] is figured; and according to Sir H. Rawlinson (as I was\r\n    informed at the British Museum), similar dogs are still imported\r\n    into this same country. I have looked through the magnificent works\r\n    of Lepsius and Rosellini, and on the Egyptian monuments from the\r\n    fourth to the twelfth dynasties (i.e. from about 3400 B.C. to 2100 \r\n    B.C.) several varieties of the dog are represented; most of them\r\n    are allied to greyhounds; at the later of these periods a dog\r\n    resembling a hound is figured, with drooping ears, but with a\r\n    longer back and more pointed head than in our hounds. There is,\r\n    also, a turnspit, with short and crooked legs, closely resembling\r\n    the existing variety; but this kind of monstrosity is so common\r\n    with various animals, as with the ancon sheep, and even, according\r\n    to Rengger, with jaguars in Paraguay, that it would be rash to look\r\n    at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits:\r\n    Colonel Sykes[5] also has described an Indian pariah dog as\r\n    presenting the same monstrous character. The most ancient dog\r\n    represented on the Egyptian monuments is one of the most singular;\r\n    it resembles a greyhound, but has long pointed ears and a short\r\n    curled tail: a closely allied variety still exists in Northern\r\n    Africa; for Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt[6] states that the Arab\r\n    boar-hound is “an eccentric hieroglyphic animal, such as Cheops\r\n    once hunted with, somewhat resembling the rough Scotch deer-hound;\r\n    their tails are curled tight round on their backs, and their ears\r\n    stick out at right angles.” With this most ancient variety a\r\n    pariah-like dog coexisted.\r\n\r\n    We thus see that, at a period between four and five thousand years\r\n    ago, various breeds, viz. pariah dogs, greyhounds, common hounds,\r\n    mastiffs, house-dogs, lapdogs, and turnspits, existed, more or less\r\n    closely resembling our present breeds. But there is not sufficient\r\n    evidence that any of these ancient dogs belonged to the same\r\n    identical sub-varieties with our present dogs.[7] As long as man\r\n    was believed to have existed on this earth only about 6000 years,\r\n    this fact of the great diversity of the breeds at so early a period\r\n    was an argument of much weight that they had proceeded from several\r\n    wild sources, for there would not have been sufficient time for\r\n    their divergence and modification. But now that we know, from the\r\n    discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of extinct\r\n    animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical\r\n    changes, that man has existed for an incomparably longer period,\r\n    and bearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess\r\n    domestic dogs, the argument from insufficient time falls away\r\n    greatly in value.\r\n\r\n    Long before the period of any historical record the dog was\r\n    domesticated in Europe. In the Danish Middens of the Neolithic or\r\n    Newer Stone period, bones of a canine animal are embedded, and\r\n    Steenstrup ingeniously argues that these belonged to a domestic\r\n    dog; for a very large proportion of the bones of birds preserved in\r\n    the refuse consists of long bones, which it was found on trial dogs\r\n    cannot devour.[8] This ancient dog was succeeded in Denmark during\r\n    the Bronze period by a larger kind, presenting certain differences,\r\n    and this again during the Iron period, by a still larger kind. In\r\n    Switzerland, we hear from Prof. Rütimeyer,[9] that during the\r\n    Neolithic period a domesticated dog of middle size existed, which\r\n    in its skull was about equally remote from the wolf and jackal, and\r\n    partook of the characters of our hounds and setters or spaniels\r\n    (Jagdhund und Wachtelhund). Rütimeyer insists strongly on the\r\n    constancy of form during a very long period of time of this the\r\n    most ancient known dog. During the Bronze period a larger dog\r\n    appeared, and this closely resembled in its jaw a dog of the same\r\n    age in Denmark. Remains of two notably distinct varieties of the\r\n    dog were found by Schmerling in a cave;[10] but their age cannot be\r\n    positively determined.\r\n\r\n    The existence of a single race, remarkably constant in form during\r\n    the whole Neolithic period, is an interesting fact in contrast with\r\n    what we see of the changes which the races underwent during the\r\n    period of the successive Egyptian monuments, and in contrast with\r\n    our existing dogs. The character of this animal during the\r\n    Neolithic period, as given by Rütimeyer, supports De Blainville’s\r\n    view that our varieties have descended from an unknown and extinct\r\n    form. But we should not forget that we know nothing with respect to\r\n    the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the world. The\r\n    succession of the different kinds of dogs in Switzerland and\r\n    Denmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering\r\n    tribes bringing with them their dogs; and this view accords with\r\n    the belief that different wild canine animals were domesticated in\r\n    different regions. Independently of the immigration of new races of\r\n    man, we know from the wide-spread presence of bronze, composed of\r\n    an alloy of tin, how much commerce there must have been throughout\r\n    Europe at an extremely remote period, and dogs would then probably\r\n    have been bartered. At the present time, amongst the savages of the\r\n    interior of Guiana, the Taruma Indians are considered the best\r\n    trainers of dogs, and possess a large breed which they barter at a\r\n    high price with other tribes.[11]\r\n\r\n    The main argument in favour of the several breeds of the dog being\r\n    the descendants of distinct wild stocks, is their resemblance in\r\n    various countries to distinct species still existing there. It\r\n    must, however, be admitted that the comparison between the wild and\r\n    domesticated animal has been made but in few cases with sufficient\r\n    exactness. Before entering on details, it will be well to show that\r\n    there is no a priori difficulty in the belief that several canine\r\n    species have been domesticated. Members of the dog family inhabit\r\n    nearly the whole world; and several species agree pretty closely in\r\n    habits and structure with our several domesticated dogs. Mr. Galton\r\n    has shown[12] how fond savages are of keeping and taming animals of\r\n    all kinds. Social animals are the most easily subjugated by man,\r\n    and several species of Canidæ hunt in packs. It deserves notice, as\r\n    bearing on other animals as well as on the dog, that at an\r\n    extremely ancient period, when man first entered any country, the\r\n    animals living there would have felt no instinctive or inherited\r\n    fear of him, and would consequently have been tamed far more easily\r\n    than at present. For instance, when the Falkland Islands were first\r\n    visited by man, the large wolf-like dog (_Canis antarcticus_)\r\n    fearlessly came to meet Byron’s sailors, who, mistaking this\r\n    ignorant curiosity for ferocity, ran into the water to avoid them:\r\n    even recently a man, by holding a piece of meat in one hand and a\r\n    knife in the other, could sometimes stick them at night. On a\r\n    island in the Sea of Aral, when first discovered by Butakoff, the\r\n    saigak antelopes, which are “generally very timid and watchful, did\r\n    not fly from us, but on the contrary looked at us with a sort of\r\n    curiosity.” So, again, on the shores of the Mauritius, the manatee\r\n    was not at first in the least afraid of man, and thus it has been\r\n    in several quarters of the world with seals and the morse. I have\r\n    elsewhere shown[13] how slowly the native birds of several islands\r\n    have acquired and inherited a salutary dread of man: at the\r\n    Galapagos Archipelago I pushed with the muzzle of my gun hawks from\r\n    a branch, and held out a pitcher of water for other birds to alight\r\n    on and drink. Quadrupeds and birds which have seldom been disturbed\r\n    by man, dread him no more than do our English birds, the cows, or\r\n    horses grazing in the fields.\r\n\r\nIt is a more important consideration that several canine species evince\r\n(as will be shown in a future chapter) no strong repugnance or\r\ninability to breed under confinement; and the incapacity to breed under\r\nconfinement is one of the commonest bars to domestication. Lastly,\r\nsavages set the highest value, as we shall see in the chapter on\r\nSelection, on dogs: even half-tamed animals are highly useful to them:\r\nthe Indians of North America cross their half-wild dogs with wolves,\r\nand thus render them even wilder than before, but bolder: the savages\r\nof Guiana catch and partially tame and use the whelps of two wild\r\nspecies of _Canis,_ as do the savages of Australia those of the wild\r\nDingo. Mr. Philip King informs me that he once trained a wild Dingo\r\npuppy to drive cattle, and found it very useful. From these several\r\nconsiderations we see that there is no difficulty in believing that man\r\nmight have domesticated various canine species in different countries.\r\nIt would indeed have been a strange fact if one species alone had been\r\ndomesticated throughout the world.\r\n\r\n    We will now enter into details. The accurate and sagacious\r\n    Richardson says, “The resemblance between the Northern American\r\n    wolves (_Canis lupus,_ var. _occidentalis_) and the domestic dogs\r\n    of the Indians is so great that the size and strength of the wolf\r\n    seems to be the only difference. I have more than once mistaken a\r\n    band of wolves for the dogs of a party of Indians; and the howl of\r\n    the animals of both species is prolonged so exactly in the same key\r\n    that even the practised ear of the Indian fails at times to\r\n    discriminate them.” He adds that the more northern Esquimaux dogs\r\n    are not only extremely like the grey wolves of the Arctic circle in\r\n    form and colour, but also nearly equal them in size. Dr. Kane has\r\n    often seen in his teams of sledge-dogs the oblique eye (a character\r\n    on which some naturalists lay great stress), the drooping tail, and\r\n    scared look of the wolf. In disposition the Esquimaux dogs differ\r\n    little from wolves, and, according to Dr. Hayes, they are capable\r\n    of no attachment to man, and are so savage that when hungry they\r\n    will attack even their masters. According to Kane they readily\r\n    become feral. Their affinity is so close with wolves that they\r\n    frequently cross with them, and the Indians take the whelps of\r\n    wolves “to improve the breed of their dogs.” The half-bred wolves\r\n    sometimes (Lamare-Picquot) cannot be tamed, “though this case is\r\n    rare;” but they do not become thoroughly well broken in till the\r\n    second or third generation. These facts show that there can be but\r\n    little, if any, sterility between the Esquimaux dog and the wolf,\r\n    for otherwise they would not be used to improve the breed. As Dr.\r\n    Hayes says of these dogs, “reclaimed wolves they doubtless\r\n    are.”[14]\r\n\r\n    North America is inhabited by a second kind of wolf, the\r\n    prairie-wolf (_Canis latrans_), which is now looked at by all\r\n    naturalists as specifically distinct from the common wolf; and is,\r\n    according to Mr. J.K. Lord, in some respects intermediate in habits\r\n    between a wolf and a fox. Sir J. Richardson, after describing the\r\n    Hare Indian dog, which differs in many respects from the Esquimaux\r\n    dog, says, “It bears the same relation to the prairie-wolf that the\r\n    Esquimaux dog does to the great grey wolf.” He could, in fact,\r\n    detect no marked difference between them; and Messrs. Nott and\r\n    Gliddon give additional details showing their close resemblance.\r\n    The dogs derived from the above two aboriginal sources cross\r\n    together and with the wild wolves, at least with the _C.\r\n    occidentalis,_ and with European dogs. In Florida, according to\r\n    Bartram, the black wolf-dog of the Indians differs in nothing from\r\n    the wolves of that country except in barking.[15]\r\n\r\n    Turning to the southern parts of the new world, Columbus found two\r\n    kinds of dogs in the West Indies; and Fernandez[16] describes three\r\n    in Mexico: some of these native dogs were dumb—that is, did not\r\n    bark. In Guiana it has been known since the time of Buffon that the\r\n    natives cross their dogs with an aboriginal species, apparently the\r\n    _Canis cancrivorus._ Sir R. Schomburgk, who has so carefully\r\n    explored these regions, writes to me, “I have been repeatedly told\r\n    by the Arawaak Indians, who reside near the coast, that they cross\r\n    their dogs with a wild species to improve the breed, and individual\r\n    dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled the _C.\r\n    cancrivorus_ much more than the common breed. It is but seldom that\r\n    the Indians keep the _C. cancrivorus_ for domestic purposes, nor is\r\n    the Ai, another species of wild dog, and which I consider to be\r\n    identical with the _Dusicyon silvestris_ of H. Smith, now much used\r\n    by the Arecunas for the purpose of hunting. The dogs of the Taruma\r\n    Indians are quite distinct, and resemble Buffon’s St. Domingo\r\n    greyhound.” It thus appears that the natives of Guiana have\r\n    partially domesticated two aboriginal species, and still cross\r\n    their dogs with them; these two species belong to a quite different\r\n    type from the North American and European wolves. A careful\r\n    observer, Rengger,[17] gives reasons for believing that a hairless\r\n    dog was domesticated when America was first visited by Europeans:\r\n    some of these dogs in Paraguay are still dumb, and Tschudi[18]\r\n    states that they suffer from cold in the Cordillera. This naked dog\r\n    is, however quite distinct from that found preserved in the ancient\r\n    Peruvian burial-places, and described by Tschudi, under the name of\r\n    _Canis ingæ,_ as withstanding cold well and as barking. It is not\r\n    known whether these two distinct kinds of dog are the descendants\r\n    of native species, and it might be argued that when man first\r\n    migrated into America he brought with him from the Asiatic\r\n    continent dogs which had not learned to bark; but this view does\r\n    not seem probable, as the natives along the line of their march\r\n    from the north reclaimed, as we have seen, at least two N. American\r\n    species of Canidæ.\r\n\r\n    Turning to the Old World, some European dogs closely resemble the\r\n    wolf; thus the shepherd dog of the plains of Hungary is white or\r\n    reddish-brown, has a sharp nose, short, erect ears, shaggy coat,\r\n    and bushy tail, and so much resembles a wolf that Mr. p.t, who\r\n    gives this description, says he has known a Hungarian mistake a\r\n    wolf for one of his own dogs. Jeitteles, also, remarks on the close\r\n    similarity of the Hungarian dog and wolf. Shepherd dogs in Italy\r\n    must anciently have closely resembled wolves, for Columella (vii.\r\n    12) advises that white dogs be kept, adding, “pastor album probat,\r\n    ne pro lupo canem feriat.” Several accounts have been given of dogs\r\n    and wolves crossing naturally; and Pliny asserts that the Gauls\r\n    tied their female dogs in the woods that they might cross with\r\n    wolves.[19] The European wolf differs slightly from that of North\r\n    America, and has been ranked by many naturalists as a distinct\r\n    species. The common wolf of India is also by some esteemed as a\r\n    third species, and here again we find a marked resemblance between\r\n    the pariah dogs of certain districts of India and the Indian\r\n    wolf.[20]\r\n\r\n    With respect to Jackals, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire[21] says\r\n    that not one constant difference can be pointed out between their\r\n    structure and that of the smaller races of dogs. They agree closely\r\n    in habits: jackals, when tamed and called by their master, wag\r\n    their tails, lick his hands, crouch, and throw themselves on their\r\n    backs; they smell at the tails of other dogs, and void their urine\r\n    sideways; they roll on carrion or on animals which they have\r\n    killed; and, lastly, when in high spirits, they run round in\r\n    circles or in a figure of eight, with their tails between their\r\n    legs.[22] A number of excellent naturalists, from the time of\r\n    Güldenstädt to that of Ehrenberg, Hemprich, and Cretzschmar, have\r\n    expressed themselves in the strongest terms with respect to the\r\n    resemblance of the half-domestic dogs of Asia and Egypt to jackals.\r\n    M. Nordmann, for instance, says, “Les chiens d’Awhasie ressemblent\r\n    étonnamment à des chacals.” Ehrenberg[23] asserts that the domestic\r\n    dogs of Lower Egypt, and certain mummied dogs, have for their wild\r\n    type a species of wolf (_C. lupaster_) of the country; whereas the\r\n    domestic dogs of Nubia and certain other mummied dogs have the\r\n    closest relation to a wild species of the same country, viz. _C.\r\n    sabbar,_ which is only a form of the common jackal. Pallas asserts\r\n    that jackals and dogs sometimes naturally cross in the East; and a\r\n    case is on record in Algeria.[24] The greater number of naturalists\r\n    divide the jackals of Asia and Africa into several species, but\r\n    some few rank them all as one.\r\n\r\n    I may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of Guinea are\r\n    fox-like animals, and are dumb.[25] On the east coast of Africa,\r\n    between latitude 4° and 6° south, and about ten days’ journey in\r\n    the interior, a semi-domestic dog, as the Rev. S. Erhardt informs\r\n    me, is kept, which the natives assert is derived from a similar\r\n    wild animal. Lichtenstein[26] says that the dogs of the Bosjemans\r\n    present a striking resemblance even in colour (excepting the black\r\n    stripe down the back) with the _C. mesomelas_ of South Africa. Mr.\r\n    E. Layard informs me that he has seen a Caffre dog which closely\r\n    resembled an Esquimaux dog. In Australia the Dingo is both\r\n    domesticated and wild; though this animal may have been introduced\r\n    aboriginally by man, yet it must be considered as almost an endemic\r\n    form, for its remains have been found in a similar state of\r\n    preservation and associated with extinct mammals, so that its\r\n    introduction must have been ancient.[27]\r\n\r\n    From this resemblance of the half-domesticated dogs in several\r\n    countries to the wild species still living there,—from the facility\r\n    with which they can often be crossed together,—from even half-tamed\r\n    animals being so much valued by savages,—and from the other\r\n    circumstances previously remarked on which favour their\r\n    domestication, it is highly probable that the domestic dogs of the\r\n    world are descended from two well-defined species of wolf (viz. _C.\r\n    lupus_ and _C. latrans),_ and from two or three other doubtful\r\n    species (namely, the European, Indian, and North African wolves);\r\n    from at least one or two South American canine species; from\r\n    several races or species of jackal; and perhaps from one or more\r\n    extinct species. Although it is possible or even probable that\r\n    domesticated dogs, introduced into any country and bred there for\r\n    many generations, might acquire some of the characters proper to\r\n    the aboriginal Canidæ of the country, we can hardly thus account\r\n    for introduced dogs having given rise to two breeds in the same\r\n    country, resembling two of its aboriginal species, as in the\r\n    above-given cases of Guiana and of North America.[28]\r\n\r\n    It cannot be objected to the view of several canine species having\r\n    been anciently domesticated, that these animals are tamed with\r\n    difficulty: facts have been already given on this head, but I may\r\n    add that the young of the _Canis primævus_ of India were tamed by\r\n    Mr. Hodgson,[29] and became as sensible of caresses, and manifested\r\n    as much intelligence, as any sporting dog of the same age. There is\r\n    not much difference, as we have already shown and shall further\r\n    see, in habits between the domestic dogs of the North American\r\n    Indians and the wolves of that country, or between the Eastern\r\n    pariah dogs and jackals, or between the dogs which have run wild in\r\n    various countries and the several natural species of the family.\r\n    The habit of barking, however, which is almost universal with\r\n    domesticated dogs, forms an exception, as it does not characterise\r\n    a single natural species of the family, though I am assured that\r\n    the _Canis latrans_ of North America utters a noise which closely\r\n    approaches a bark. But this habit is soon lost by dogs when they\r\n    become feral and is soon reacquired when they are again\r\n    domesticated. The case of the wild dogs on the island of Juan\r\n    Fernandez having become dumb has often been quoted, and there is\r\n    reason to believe[30] that the dumbness ensued in the course of\r\n    thirty-three years; on the other hand, dogs taken from this island\r\n    by Ulloa slowly reacquired the habit of barking. The\r\n    Mackenzie-river dogs, of the _Canis latrans_ type, when brought to\r\n    England, never learned to bark properly; but one born in the\r\n    Zoological Gardens[31] “made his voice sound as loudly as any other\r\n    dog of the same age and size.” According to Professor Nillson,[32]\r\n    a wolf-whelp reared by a bitch barks. I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\r\n    exhibited a jackal which barked with the same tone as any common\r\n    dog.[33] An interesting account has been given by Mr. G. Clarke[34]\r\n    of some dogs run wild on Juan de Nova, in the Indian Ocean; “they\r\n    had entirely lost the faculty of barking; they had no inclination\r\n    for the company of other dogs, nor did they acquire their voice”\r\n    during a captivity of several months. On the island they\r\n    “congregate in vast packs, and catch sea-birds with as much address\r\n    as foxes could display.” The feral dogs of La Plata have not become\r\n    dumb; they are of large size, hunt singly or in packs, and burrow\r\n    holes for their young.[35] In these habits the feral dogs of La\r\n    Plata resemble wolves and jackals; both of which hunt either singly\r\n    or in packs, and burrow holes.[36] These feral dogs have not become\r\n    uniform in colour on Juan Fernandez, Juan de Nova, or La Plata.[37]\r\n    In Cuba the feral dogs are described by Poeppig as nearly all\r\n    mouse-coloured, with short ears and light-blue eyes. In St.\r\n    Domingo, Col. Ham. Smith says[38] that the feral dogs are very\r\n    large, like greyhounds, of a uniform pale blue-ash, with small\r\n    ears, and large light-brown eyes. Even the wild Dingo, though so\r\n    anciently naturalised in Australia, “varies considerably in\r\n    colour,” as I am informed by Mr. P.P. King: a half-bred Dingo\r\n    reared in England[39] showed signs of wishing to burrow.\r\n\r\n    From the several foregoing facts we see that reversion in the feral\r\n    state gives no indication of the colour or size of the aboriginal\r\n    parent-species. One fact, however, with respect to the colouring of\r\n    domestic dogs, I at one time hoped might have thrown some light on\r\n    their origin; and it is worth giving, as showing how colouring\r\n    follows laws, even in so anciently and thoroughly domesticated an\r\n    animal as the dog. Black dogs with tan-coloured feet, whatever\r\n    breed they may belong to, almost invariably have a tan-coloured\r\n    spot on the upper and inner corners of each eye, and their lips are\r\n    generally thus coloured. I have seen only two exceptions to this\r\n    rule, namely, in a spaniel and terrier. Dogs of a light-brown\r\n    colour often have a lighter, yellowish-brown spot over the eyes;\r\n    sometimes the spot is white, and in a mongrel terrier the spot was\r\n    black. Mr. Waring kindly examined for me a stud of fifteen\r\n    greyhounds in Suffolk: eleven of them were black, or black and\r\n    white, or brindled, and these had no eye-spots; but three were red\r\n    and one slaty-blue, and these four had dark-coloured spots over\r\n    their eyes. Although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour,\r\n    they strongly tend to be tan-coloured; this is proved by my having\r\n    seen four spaniels, a setter, two Yorkshire shepherd dogs, a large\r\n    mongrel, and some fox-hounds, coloured black and white, with not a\r\n    trace of tan-colour, excepting the spots over the eyes, and\r\n    sometimes a little on the feet. These latter cases, and many\r\n    others, show plainly that the colour of the feet and the eye-spots\r\n    are in some way correlated. I have noticed, in various breeds,\r\n    every gradation, from the whole face being tan-coloured, to a\r\n    complete ring round the eyes, to a minute spot over the inner and\r\n    upper corners. The spots occur in various sub-breeds of terriers\r\n    and spaniels; in setters; in hounds of various kinds, including the\r\n    turnspit-like German badger-hound; in shepherd dogs; in a mongrel,\r\n    of which neither parent had the spots; in one pure bulldog, though\r\n    the spots were in this case almost white; and in greyhounds,—but\r\n    true black-and-tan greyhounds are excessively rare; nevertheless I\r\n    have been assured by Mr. Warwick, that one ran at the Caledonian\r\n    Champion meeting of April 1860, and was “marked precisely like a\r\n    black-and-tan terrier.” This dog, or another exactly the same\r\n    colour, ran at the Scottish National Club on the 21st of March,\r\n    1865; and I hear from Mr. C. M. Browne, that “there was no reason\r\n    either on the sire or dam side for the appearance of this unusual\r\n    colour.” Mr. Swinhoe at my request looked at the dogs in China, at\r\n    Amoy, and he soon noticed a brown dog with yellow spots over the\r\n    eyes. Colonel H. Smith[40] figures the magnificent black mastiff of\r\n    Thibet with a tan-coloured stripe over the eyes, feet, and chaps;\r\n    and what is more singular, he figures the Alco, or native domestic\r\n    dog of Mexico, as black and white, with narrow tan-coloured rings\r\n    round the eyes; at the Exhibition of dogs in London, May 1863, a\r\n    so-called forest dog from North-West Mexico was shown, which had\r\n    pale tan-coloured spots over the eyes. The occurrence of these\r\n    tan-coloured spots in dogs of such extremely different breeds,\r\n    living in various parts of the world, makes the fact highly\r\n    remarkable.\r\n\r\n    We shall hereafter see, especially in the chapter on Pigeons, that\r\n    coloured marks are strongly inherited, and that they often aid us\r\n    in discovering the primitive forms of our domestic races. Hence, if\r\n    any wild canine species had distinctly exhibited the tan-coloured\r\n    spots over the eyes, it might have been argued that this was the\r\n    parent-form of nearly all our domestic races. But after looking at\r\n    many coloured plates, and through the whole collection of skins in\r\n    the British Museum, I can find no species thus marked. It is no\r\n    doubt possible that some extinct species was thus coloured. On the\r\n    other hand, in looking at the various species, there seems to be a\r\n    tolerably plain correlation between tan-coloured legs and face; and\r\n    less frequently between black legs and a black face; and this\r\n    general rule of colouring explains to a certain extent the\r\n    above-given cases of correlation between the eye-spots and the\r\n    colour of the feet. Moreover, some jackals and foxes have a trace\r\n    of a white ring round their eyes, as in _C. mesomelas, C. aureus,_\r\n    and (judging from Colonel H. Smith’s drawing) in _C. alopex,_ and\r\n    _C. thaleb._ Other species have a trace of a black line over the\r\n    corners of the eyes, as in _C. variegatus, cinereo-variegatus,_ and\r\n    _fulvus,_ and the wild Dingo. Hence I am inclined to conclude that\r\n    a tendency for tan-coloured spots to appear over the eyes in the\r\n    various breeds of dogs, is analogous to the case observed by\r\n    Desmarest, namely, that when any white appears on a dog the tip of\r\n    the tail is always white, “de manière à rappeler la tache terminale\r\n    de même couleur, qui caractérise la plupart des Canidés\r\n    sauvages.”[41] This rule, however, as I am assured by Mr. Jesse,\r\n    does not invariably hold good.\r\n\r\n    It has been objected that our domestic dogs cannot be descended\r\n    from wolves or jackals, because their periods of gestation are\r\n    different. The supposed difference rests on statements made by\r\n    Buffon, Gilibert, Bechstein, and others; but these are now known to\r\n    be erroneous; and the period is found to agree in the wolf, jackal,\r\n    and dog, as closely as could be expected, for it is often in some\r\n    degree variable.[42] Tessier, who has closely attended to this\r\n    subject, allows a difference of four days in the gestation of the\r\n    dog. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me three carefully recorded cases\r\n    of retrievers, in which the bitch was put only once to the dog; and\r\n    not counting this day, but counting that of parturition, the\r\n    periods were fifty-nine, sixty-two, and sixty-seven days. The\r\n    average period is sixty-three days; but Bellingeri states that this\r\n    applies only to large dogs; and that for small races it is from\r\n    sixty to sixty-three days; Mr. Eyton of Eyton, who has had much\r\n    experience with dogs, also informs me that the time is apt to be\r\n    longer with large than with small dogs.\r\n\r\n    F. Cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been\r\n    domesticated on account of its offensive smell; but savages are not\r\n    sensitive in this respect. The degree of odour, also, differs in\r\n    the different kinds of jackal;[43] and Colonel H. Smith makes a\r\n    sectional division of the group with one character dependent on not\r\n    being offensive. On the other hand, dogs— for instance, rough and\r\n    smooth terriers—differ much in this respect; and M. Godron states\r\n    that the hairless so-called Turkish dog is more odoriferous than\r\n    other dogs. Isidore Geoffroy[44] gave to a dog the same odour as\r\n    that from a jackal by feeding it on raw flesh.\r\n\r\n    The belief that our dogs are descended from wolves, jackals, South\r\n    American Canidæ, and other species, suggests a far more important\r\n    difficulty. These animals in their undomesticated state, judging\r\n    from a widely-spread analogy, would have been in some degree\r\n    sterile if intercrossed; and such sterility will be admitted as\r\n    almost certain by all those who believe that the lessened fertility\r\n    of crossed forms is an infallible criterion of specific\r\n    distinctness. Anyhow these animals keep distinct in the countries\r\n    which they inhabit in common. On the other hand, all domestic dogs,\r\n    which are here supposed to be descended from several distinct\r\n    species, are, as far as is known, mutually fertile together. But,\r\n    as Broca has well remarked,[45] the fertility of successive\r\n    generations of mongrel dogs has never been scrutinised with that\r\n    care which is thought indispensable when species are crossed. The\r\n    few facts leading to the conclusion that the sexual feelings and\r\n    reproductive powers differ in the several races of the dog when\r\n    crossed are (passing over mere size as rendering propagation\r\n    difficult) as follows: the Mexican Alco[46] apparently dislikes\r\n    dogs of other kinds, but this perhaps is not strictly a sexual\r\n    feeling; the hairless endemic dog of Paraguay, according to\r\n    Rengger, mixes less with the European races than these do with each\r\n    other; the Spitz dog in Germany is said to receive the fox more\r\n    readily than do other breeds; and Dr. Hodgkin states that a female\r\n    Dingo in England attracted the male wild foxes. If these latter\r\n    statements can be trusted, they prove some degree of sexual\r\n    difference in the breeds of the dog. But the fact remains that our\r\n    domestic dogs, differing so widely as they do in external\r\n    structure, are far more fertile together than we have reason to\r\n    believe their supposed wild parents would have been. Pallas\r\n    assumes[47] that a long course of domestication eliminates that\r\n    sterility which the parent-species would have exhibited if only\r\n    lately captured; no distinct facts are recorded in support of this\r\n    hypothesis; but the evidence seems to me so strong (independently\r\n    of the evidence derived from other domesticated animals) in favour\r\n    of our domestic dogs having descended from several wild stocks,\r\n    that I am inclined to admit the truth of this hypothesis.\r\n\r\n    There is another and closely allied difficulty consequent on the\r\n    doctrine of the descent of our domestic dogs from several wild\r\n    species, namely, that they do not seem to be perfectly fertile with\r\n    their supposed parents. But the experiment has not been quite\r\n    fairly tried; the Hungarian dog, for instance, which in external\r\n    appearance so closely resembles the European wolf, ought to be\r\n    crossed with this wolf: and the pariah dogs of India with Indian\r\n    wolves and jackals; and so in other cases. That the sterility is\r\n    very slight between certain dogs and wolves and other Canidæ is\r\n    shown by savages taking the trouble to cross them. Buffon got four\r\n    successive generations from the wolf and dog, and the mongrels were\r\n    perfectly fertile together.[48] But more lately M. Flourens states\r\n    positively as the result of his numerous experiments that hybrids\r\n    from the wolf and dog, crossed _inter se,_ become sterile at the\r\n    third generation, and those from the jackal and dog at the fourth\r\n    generation.[49] But these animals were closely confined; and many\r\n    wild animals, as we shall see in a future chapter, are rendered by\r\n    confinement in some degree or even utterly sterile. The Dingo,\r\n    which breeds freely in Australia with our imported dogs, would not\r\n    breed though repeatedly crossed in the Jardin des Plantes.[50] Some\r\n    hounds from Central Africa, brought home by Major Denham, never\r\n    bred in the Town of London;[51] and a similar tendency to sterility\r\n    might be transmitted to the hybrid offspring of a wild animal.\r\n    Moreover, it appears that in M. Flourens’ experiments the hybrids\r\n    were closely bred in and in for three or four generations; and this\r\n    circumstance would most certainly increase the tendency to\r\n    sterility. Several years ago I saw confined in the Zoological\r\n    Gardens of London a female hybrid from an English dog and jackal,\r\n    which even in this the first generation was so sterile that, as I\r\n    was assured by her keeper, she did not fully exhibit her proper\r\n    periods; but this case was certainly exceptional, as numerous\r\n    instances have occurred of fertile hybrids from these two animals.\r\n    In almost all experiments on the crossing of animals there are so\r\n    many causes of doubt, that it is extremely difficult to come to any\r\n    positive conclusion. It would, however, appear, that those who\r\n    believe that our dogs are descended from several species will have\r\n    not only to admit that their offspring after a long course of\r\n    domestication generally lose all tendency to sterility when crossed\r\n    together; but that between certain breeds of dogs and some of their\r\n    supposed aboriginal parents a certain degree of sterility has been\r\n    retained or possibly even acquired.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulties in regard to fertility given in the\r\nlast two paragraphs, when we reflect on the inherent improbability of\r\nman having domesticated throughout the world one single species alone\r\nof so widely distributed, so easily tamed, and so useful a group as the\r\nCanidæ; when we reflect on the extreme antiquity of the different\r\nbreeds; and especially when we reflect on the close similarity, both in\r\nexternal structure and habits, between the domestic dogs of various\r\ncountries and the wild species still inhabiting these same countries,\r\nthe balance of evidence is strongly in favour of the multiple origin of\r\nour dogs.\r\n\r\n    _Differences between the several Breeds of the Dog.—_If the several\r\n    breeds have descended from several wild stocks, their difference\r\n    can obviously in part be explained by that of their parent species.\r\n    For instance, the form of the greyhound may be partly accounted for\r\n    by descent from some such animal as the slim Abyssinian _Canis\r\n    simensis,_[52] with its elongated muzzle; that of the larger dogs\r\n    from the larger wolves, and the smaller and slighter dogs from the\r\n    jackals: and thus perhaps we may account for certain constitutional\r\n    and climatal differences. But it would be a great error to suppose\r\n    that there has not been in addition[53] a large amount of\r\n    variation. The intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild stocks,\r\n    and of the subsequently formed races, has probably increased the\r\n    total number of breeds, and, as we shall presently see, has greatly\r\n    modified some of them. But we cannot explain by crossing the origin\r\n    of such extreme forms as thoroughbred greyhounds, bloodhounds,\r\n    bulldogs, Blenheim spaniels, terriers, pugs, etc., unless we\r\n    believe that forms equally or more strongly characterised in these\r\n    different respects once existed in nature. But hardly any one has\r\n    been bold enough to suppose that such unnatural forms ever did or\r\n    could exist in a wild state. When compared with all known members\r\n    of the family of Canidæ they betray a distinct and abnormal origin.\r\n    No instance is on record of such dogs as bloodhounds, spaniels,\r\n    true greyhounds having been kept by savages: they are the product\r\n    of long-continued civilisation.\r\n\r\n    The number of breeds and sub-breeds of the dog is great; Youatt for\r\n    instance, describes twelve kinds of greyhounds. I will not attempt\r\n    to enumerate or describe the varieties, for we cannot discriminate\r\n    how much of their difference is due to variation, and how much to\r\n    descent from different aboriginal stocks. But it may be worth while\r\n    briefly to mention some points. Commencing with the skull, Cuvier\r\n    has admitted[54] that in form the differences are “plus fortes que\r\n    celles d’aucunes espèces sauvages d’un même genre naturel.” The\r\n    proportions of the different bones; the curvature of the lower jaw,\r\n    the position of the condyles with respect to the plane of the teeth\r\n    (on which F. Cuvier founded his classification), and in mastiffs\r\n    the shape of its posterior branch; the shape of the zygomatic arch,\r\n    and of the temporal fossae; the position of the occiput—all vary\r\n    considerably.[55] The difference in size between the brains of dogs\r\n    belonging to large and small breeds “is something prodigious.”\r\n    “Some dogs’ brains are high and rounded, while others are low,\r\n    long, and narrow in front.” In the latter, “the olfactory lobes are\r\n    visible for about half their extent, when the brain is seen from\r\n    above, but they are wholly concealed by the hemispheres in other\r\n    breeds.”[56] The dog has properly six pairs of molar teeth in the\r\n    upper jaw, and seven in the lower; but several naturalists have\r\n    seen not rarely an additional pair in the upper jaw;[57] and\r\n    Professor Gervais says that there are dogs “qui ont sept paires de\r\n    dents supérieures et huit inférieures.” De Blainville[58] has given\r\n    full particulars on the frequency of these deviations in the number\r\n    of the teeth, and has shown that it is not always the same tooth\r\n    which is supernumerary. In short-muzzled races, according to H.\r\n    Müller,[59] the molar teeth stand obliquely, whilst in long-muzzled\r\n    races they are placed longitudinally, with open spaces between\r\n    them. The naked, so-called Egyptian or Turkish dog is extremely\r\n    deficient in its teeth,[60] —sometimes having none except one molar\r\n    on each side; but this, though characteristic of the breed, must be\r\n    considered as a monstrosity. M. Girard,[61] who seems to have\r\n    attended closely to the subject, says that the period of the\r\n    appearance of the permanent teeth differs in different dogs, being\r\n    earlier in large dogs; thus the mastiff assumes its adult teeth in\r\n    four or five months, whilst in the spaniel the period is sometimes\r\n    more than seven or eight months. On the other hand small dogs are\r\n    mature, and the females have arrived at the best age for breeding,\r\n    when one year old, whereas large dogs “are still in their puppyhood\r\n    at this time, and take fully twice as long to develop their\r\n    proportions.”[62]\r\n\r\n    With respect to minor differences little need be said. Isidore\r\n    Geoffroy has shown[63] that in size some dogs are six times as long\r\n    (the tail being excluded) as others; and that the height relatively\r\n    to the length of the body varies from between one to two, and one\r\n    to nearly four. In the Scotch deer-hound there is a striking and\r\n    remarkable difference in the size of the male and female.[64] Every\r\n    one knows how the ears vary in size in different breeds, and with\r\n    their great development their muscles become atrophied. Certain\r\n    breeds of dogs are described as having a deep furrow between the\r\n    nostrils and lips. The caudal vertebrae, according to F. Cuvier, on\r\n    whose authority the two last statements rest, vary in number; and\r\n    the tail in English cattle and some shepherd dogs is almost absent.\r\n    The mammae vary from seven to ten in number; Daubenton, having\r\n    examined twenty-one dogs, found eight with five mammae on each\r\n    side; eight with four on each side; and the others with an unequal\r\n    number on the two sides.[65] Dogs have properly five toes in front\r\n    and four behind, but a fifth toe is often added; and F. Cuvier\r\n    states that, when a fifth toe is present, a fourth cuneiform bone\r\n    is developed; and, in this case, sometimes the great cuneiform bone\r\n    is raised, and gives on its inner side a large articular surface to\r\n    the astragalus; so that even the relative connection of the bones,\r\n    the most constant of all characters, varies. These modifications,\r\n    however, in the feet of dogs are not important, because they ought\r\n    to be ranked, as De Blainville has shown[66] as monstrosities.\r\n    Nevertheless they are interesting from being correlated with the\r\n    size of the body, for they occur much more frequently with mastiffs\r\n    and other large breeds than with small dogs. Closely allied\r\n    varieties, however, sometimes differ in this respect; thus Mr.\r\n    Hodgson states that the black-and-tan Lassa variety of the Thibet\r\n    mastiff has the fifth digit, whilst the Mustang sub-variety is not\r\n    thus characterised. The extent to which the skin is developed\r\n    between the toes varies much; but we shall return to this point.\r\n    The degree to which the various breeds differ in the perfection of\r\n    their senses, dispositions, and inherited habits is notorious to\r\n    every one. The breeds present some constitutional differences: the\r\n    pulse, says Youatt[67] “varies materially according to the breed,\r\n    as well as to the size of the animal.” Different breeds of dogs are\r\n    subject in different degrees to various diseases. They certainly\r\n    become adapted to different climates under which they have long\r\n    existed. It is notorious that most of our best European breeds\r\n    deteriorate in India.[68] The Rev R. Everest[69] believes that no\r\n    one has succeeded in keeping the Newfoundland dog long alive in\r\n    India; so it is, according to Lichtenstein,[70] even at the Cape of\r\n    Good Hope. The Thibet mastiff degenerates on the plains of India,\r\n    and can live only on the mountains.[71] Lloyd[72] asserts that our\r\n    bloodhounds and bulldogs have been tried, and cannot withstand the\r\n    cold of the northern European forests.\r\n\r\n    Seeing in how many characters the races of the dog differ from each\r\n    other, and remembering Cuvier’s admission that their skulls differ\r\n    more than do those of the species of any natural genus, and bearing\r\n    in mind how closely the bones of wolves, jackals, foxes, and other\r\n    Canidæ agree, it is remarkable that we meet with the statement,\r\n    repeated over and over again, that the races of the dog differ in\r\n    no important characters. A highly competent judge, Prof.\r\n    Gervais,[73] admits “si l’on prenait sans contrôle les alterations\r\n    dont chacun de ces organes est susceptible, on pourrait croire\r\n    qu’il y a entre les chiens domestiques des différences plus grandes\r\n    que celles qui séparent ailleurs les espèces, quelquefois même les\r\n    genres.” Some of the differences above enumerated are in one\r\n    respect of comparatively little value, for they are not\r\n    characteristic of distinct breeds: no one pretends that such is the\r\n    case with the additional molar teeth or with the number of mammae;\r\n    the additional digit is generally present with mastiffs, and some\r\n    of the more important differences in the skull and lower jaw are\r\n    more or less characteristic of various breeds. But we must not\r\n    forget that the predominant power of selection has not been applied\r\n    in any of these cases; we have variability in important parts, but\r\n    the differences have not been fixed by selection. Man cares for the\r\n    form and fleetness of his greyhounds, for the size of his mastiffs,\r\n    and formerly for the strength of the jaw in his bulldogs, etc.; but\r\n    he cares nothing about the number of their molar teeth or mammae or\r\n    digits; nor do we know that differences in these organs are\r\n    correlated with, or owe their development to, differences in other\r\n    parts of the body about which man does care. Those who have\r\n    attended to the subject of selection will admit that, nature having\r\n    given variability, man, if he so chose, could fix five toes to the\r\n    hinder feet of certain breeds of dogs, as certainly as to the feet\r\n    of his Dorking fowls: he could probably fix, but with much more\r\n    difficulty, an additional pair of molar teeth in either jaw, in the\r\n    same way as he has given additional horns to certain breeds of\r\n    sheep; if he wished to produce a toothless breed of dogs, having\r\n    the so-called Turkish dog with its imperfect teeth to work on, he\r\n    could probably do so, for he has succeeded in making hornless\r\n    breeds of cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the precise causes and steps by which the several\r\n    races of dogs have come to differ so greatly from each other, we\r\n    are, as in most other cases, profoundly ignorant. We may attribute\r\n    part of the difference in external form and constitution to\r\n    inheritance from distinct wild stocks, that is to changes effected\r\n    under nature before domestication. We must attribute something to\r\n    the crossing of the several domestic and natural races. I shall,\r\n    however, soon recur to the crossing of races. We have already seen\r\n    how often savages cross their dogs with wild native species; and\r\n    Pennant gives a curious account[74] of the manner in which\r\n    Fochabers, in Scotland, was stocked “with a multitude of curs of a\r\n    most wolfish aspect” from a single hybrid-wolf brought into that\r\n    district.\r\n\r\n    It would appear that climate to a certain extent directly modifies\r\n    the forms of dogs. We have lately seen that several of our English\r\n    breeds cannot live in India, and it is positively asserted that\r\n    when bred there for a few generations they degenerate not only in\r\n    their mental faculties, but in form. Captain Williamson,[75] who\r\n    carefully attended to this subject, states that “hounds are the\r\n    most rapid in their decline;” “greyhounds and pointers, also,\r\n    rapidly decline.” But spaniels, after eight or nine generations,\r\n    and without a cross from Europe, are as good as their ancestors.\r\n    Dr. Falconer informs me that bulldogs, which have been known, when\r\n    first brought into the country, to pin down even an elephant by its\r\n    trunk, not only fall off after two or three generations in pluck\r\n    and ferocity, but lose the under-hung character of their lower\r\n    jaws; their muzzles become finer and their bodies lighter. English\r\n    dogs imported into India are so valuable that probably due care has\r\n    been taken to prevent their crossing with native dogs; so that the\r\n    deterioration cannot be thus accounted for. The Rev. R. Everest\r\n    informs me that he obtained a pair of setters, born in India, which\r\n    perfectly resembled their Scotch parents: he raised several litters\r\n    from them in Delhi, taking the most stringent precautions to\r\n    prevent a cross, but he never succeeded, though this was only the\r\n    second generation in India, in obtaining a single young dog like\r\n    its parents in size or make; their nostrils were more contracted,\r\n    their noses more pointed, their size inferior, and their limbs more\r\n    slender. So again on the coast of Guinea, dogs, according to\r\n    Bosman, “alter strangely; their ears grow long and stiff like those\r\n    of foxes, to which colour they also incline, so that in three or\r\n    four years, they degenerate into very ugly creatures; and in three\r\n    or four broods their barking turns into a howl.”[76] This\r\n    remarkable tendency to rapid deterioration in European dogs\r\n    subjected to the climate of India and Africa, may be largely\r\n    accounted for by reversion to a primordial condition which many\r\n    animals exhibit, as we shall hereafter see, when their\r\n    constitutions are in any way disturbed.\r\n\r\n    Some of the peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds of\r\n    the dog have probably arisen suddenly, and, though strictly\r\n    inherited, may be called monstrosities; for instance, the shape of\r\n    the legs and body in the turnspit of Europe and India; the shape of\r\n    the head and the under-hanging jaw in the bull-and pug-dog, so\r\n    alike in this one respect and so unlike in all others. A\r\n    peculiarity suddenly arising, and therefore in one sense deserving\r\n    to be called a monstrosity, may, however, be increased and fixed by\r\n    man’s selection. We can hardly doubt that long-continued training,\r\n    as with the greyhound in coursing hares, as with water-dogs in\r\n    swimming—and the want of exercise, in the case of lapdogs—must have\r\n    produced some direct effect on their structure and instincts. But\r\n    we shall immediately see that the most potent cause of change has\r\n    probably been the selection, both methodical and unconscious, of\r\n    slight individual differences,—the latter kind of selection\r\n    resulting from the occasional preservation, during hundreds of\r\n    generations, of those individual dogs which were the most useful to\r\n    man for certain purposes and under certain conditions of life. In a\r\n    future chapter on Selection I shall show that even barbarians\r\n    attend closely to the qualities of their dogs. This unconscious\r\n    selection by man would be aided by a kind of natural selection; for\r\n    the dogs of savages have partly to gain their own subsistence: for\r\n    instance, in Australia, as we hear from Mr. Nind,[77] the dogs are\r\n    sometimes compelled by want to leave their masters and provide for\r\n    themselves; but in a few days they generally return. And we may\r\n    infer that dogs of different shapes, sizes, and habits, would have\r\n    the best chance of surviving under different circumstances,—on open\r\n    sterile plains, where they have to run down their own prey,—on\r\n    rocky coasts, where they have to feed on crabs and fish left in the\r\n    tidal pools, as in the case of New Guinea and Tierra del Fuego. In\r\n    this latter country, as I am informed by Mr. Bridges, the Catechist\r\n    to the Mission, the dogs turn over the stones on the shore to catch\r\n    the crustaceans which lie beneath, and they “are clever enough to\r\n    knock off the shell-fish at a first blow;” for if this be not done,\r\n    shell-fish are well-known to have an almost invincible power of\r\n    adhesion.\r\n\r\n    It has already been remarked that dogs differ in the degree to\r\n    which their feet are webbed. In dogs of the Newfoundland breed,\r\n    which are eminently aquatic in their habits, the skin, according to\r\n    Isidore Geoffroy,[78] extends to the third phalanges whilst in\r\n    ordinary dogs it extends only to the second. In two Newfoundland\r\n    dogs which I examined, when the toes were stretched apart and\r\n    viewed on the under side, the skin extended in a nearly straight\r\n    line between the outer margins of the balls of the toes; whereas,\r\n    in two terriers of distinct sub-breeds, the skin viewed in the same\r\n    manner was deeply scooped out. In Canada there is a dog which is\r\n    peculiar to the country and common there, and this has “half-webbed\r\n    feet and is fond of the water.”[79] English otter-hounds are said\r\n    to have webbed feet: a friend examined for me the feet of two, in\r\n    comparison with the feet of some harriers and bloodhounds; he found\r\n    the skin variable in extent in all, but more developed in the\r\n    otter-hounds than in the others.[80] As aquatic animals which\r\n    belong to quite different orders have webbed feet, there can be no\r\n    doubt that this structure would be serviceable to dogs that\r\n    frequent the water. We may confidently infer that no man ever\r\n    selected his water-dogs by the extent to which the skin was\r\n    developed between their toes; but what he does, is to preserve and\r\n    breed from those individuals which hunt best in the water, or best\r\n    retrieve wounded game, and thus he unconsciously selects dogs with\r\n    feet slightly better webbed. The effects of use from the frequent\r\n    stretching apart of the toes will likewise aid in the result. Man\r\n    thus closely imitates Natural Selection. We have an excellent\r\n    illustration of this same process in North America, where,\r\n    according to Sir J. Richardson,[81] all the wolves, foxes, and\r\n    aboriginal domestic dogs have their feet broader than in the\r\n    corresponding species of the Old World, and “well calculated for\r\n    running on the snow” Now, in these Arctic regions, the life or\r\n    death of every animal will often depend on its success in hunting\r\n    over the snow when soft; and this will in part depend on the feet\r\n    being broad; yet they must not be so broad as to interfere with the\r\n    activity of the animal when the ground is sticky, or with its power\r\n    of burrowing holes, or with other necessary habits of life.\r\n\r\n    As changes in domestic breeds which take place so slowly are not to\r\n    be noticed at any one period, whether due to the selection of\r\n    individual variations or of differences resulting from crosses, are\r\n    most important in understanding the origin of our domestic\r\n    productions, and likewise in throwing indirect light on the changes\r\n    effected under nature, I will give in detail such cases as I have\r\n    been able to collect. Lawrence,[82] who paid particular attention\r\n    to the history of the foxhound, writing in 1829, says that between\r\n    eighty and ninety years before “an entirely new foxhound was raised\r\n    through the breeder’s art,” the ears of the old southern hound\r\n    being reduced, the bone and bulk lightened, the waist increased in\r\n    length, and the stature somewhat added to. It is believed that this\r\n    was effected by a cross with a greyhound. With respect to this\r\n    latter dog, Youatt,[83] who is generally cautious in his\r\n    statements, says that the greyhound within the last fifty years,\r\n    that is before the commencement of the present century, “assumed a\r\n    somewhat different character from that which he once possessed. He\r\n    is now distinguished by a beautiful symmetry of form, of which he\r\n    could not once boast, and he has even superior speed to that which\r\n    he formerly exhibited. He is no longer used to struggle with deer,\r\n    but contends with his fellows over a shorter and speedier course.”\r\n    An able writer[84] believes that our English greyhounds are the\r\n    descendants, _progressively improved,_ of the large rough\r\n    greyhounds which existed in Scotland so early as the third century.\r\n    A cross at some former period with the Italian greyhound has been\r\n    suspected; but this seems hardly probable, considering the\r\n    feebleness of this latter breed. Lord Orford, as is well-known,\r\n    crossed his famous greyhounds, which failed in courage, with a\r\n    bulldog—this breed being chosen from being erroneously supposed to\r\n    be deficient in the power of scent; “after the sixth or seventh\r\n    generation,” says Youatt, “there was not a vestige left of the form\r\n    of the bulldog, but his courage and indomitable perseverance\r\n    remained.”\r\n\r\n    Youatt infers, from a comparison of an old picture of King\r\n    Charles’s spaniels with the living dog, that “the breed of the\r\n    present day is materially altered for the worse:” the muzzle has\r\n    become shorter, the forehead more prominent, and the eyes larger;\r\n    the changes in this case have probably been due to simple\r\n    selection. The setter, as this author remarks in another place, “is\r\n    evidently the large spaniel improved to his present peculiar size\r\n    and beauty, and taught another way of marking his game. If the form\r\n    of the dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on this point, we\r\n    might have recourse to history:” he then refers to a document dated\r\n    1685 bearing on this subject, and adds that the pure Irish setter\r\n    shows no signs of a cross with the pointer, which some authors\r\n    suspect has been the case with the English setter. The bulldog is\r\n    an English breed, and as I hear from Mr. G. R. Jesse,[85] seems to\r\n    have originated from the mastiff since the time of Shakspeare; but\r\n    certainly existed in 1631, as shown by Prestwick Eaton’s letters.\r\n    There can be no doubt that the fancy bulldogs of the present day,\r\n    now that they are not used for bull-baiting, have become greatly\r\n    reduced in size, without any express intention on the part of the\r\n    breeder. Our pointers are certainly descended from a Spanish breed,\r\n    as even their present names, Don, Ponto, Carlos, etc., show; it is\r\n    said that they were not known in England before the Revolution in\r\n    1688;[86] but the breed since its introduction has been much\r\n    modified, for Mr. Borrow, who is a sportsman and knows Spain\r\n    intimately well, informs me that he has not seen in that country\r\n    any breed “corresponding in figure with the English pointer; but\r\n    there are genuine pointers near Xeres which have been imported by\r\n    English gentlemen.” A nearly parallel case is offered by the\r\n    Newfoundland dog, which was certainly brought into England from\r\n    that country, but which has since been so much modified that, as\r\n    several writers have observed, it does not now closely resemble any\r\n    existing native dog in Newfoundland.[87]\r\n\r\nThese several cases of slow and gradual changes in our English dogs\r\npossess some interest; for though the changes have generally, but not\r\ninvariably, been caused by one or two crosses with a distinct breed,\r\nyet we may feel sure, from the well-known extreme variability of\r\ncrossed breeds, that rigorous and long-continued selection must have\r\nbeen practised, in order to improve them in a definite manner. As soon\r\nas any strain or family became slightly improved or better adapted to\r\nalter circumstances, it would tend to supplant the older and less\r\nimproved strains. For instance, as soon as the old foxhound was\r\nimproved by a cross with the greyhound, or by simple selection, and\r\nassumed its present character—and the change was probably desired owing\r\nto the increased fleetness of our hunters—it rapidly spread throughout\r\nthe country, and is now everywhere nearly uniform. But the process of\r\nimprovement is still going on for every one tries to improve his strain\r\nby occasionally procuring dogs from the best kennels. Through this\r\nprocess of gradual substitution the old English hound has been lost;\r\nand so it has been with the Irish wolf-dog, the old English bulldog,\r\nand several other breeds, such as the alaunt, as I am informed by Mr.\r\nJesse. But the extinction of former breeds is apparently aided by\r\nanother cause; for whenever a breed is kept in scanty numbers, as at\r\npresent with the bloodhound, it is reared with some difficulty,\r\napparently from the evil effects of long-continued close interbreeding.\r\nAs several breeds of the dog have been slightly but sensibly modified\r\nwithin so short a period as the last one or two centuries, by the\r\nselection of the best individuals, modified in many cases by crosses\r\nwith other breeds; and as we shall hereafter see that the breeding of\r\ndogs was attended to in ancient times, as it still is by savages, we\r\nmay conclude that we have in selection, even if only occasionally\r\npractised, a potent means of modification.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC CATS.\r\n\r\n    Cats have been domesticated in the East from an ancient period; Mr.\r\n    Blyth informs me that they are mentioned in a Sanskrit writing 2000\r\n    years old, and in Egypt their antiquity is known to be even\r\n    greater, as shown by monumental drawings and their mummied bodies.\r\n    These mummies, according to De Blainville,[88] who has particularly\r\n    studied the subject, belong to no less than three species, namely,\r\n    _F. caligulata,_ bubastes, and _chaus._ The two former species are\r\n    said to be still found, both wild and domesticated, in parts of\r\n    Egypt. _F. caligulata_ presents a difference in the first inferior\r\n    milk molar tooth, as compared with the domestic cats of Europe,\r\n    which makes De Blainville conclude that it is not one of the\r\n    parent-forms of our cats. Several naturalists, as Pallas, Temminck,\r\n    Blyth, believe that domestic cats are the descendants of several\r\n    species commingled: it is certain that cats cross readily with\r\n    various wild species, and it would appear that the character of the\r\n    domestic breeds has, at least in some cases, been thus affected.\r\n    Sir W. Jardine has no doubt that, “in the north of Scotland, there\r\n    has been occasional crossing with our native species (_F.\r\n    sylvestris_), and that the result of these crosses has been kept in\r\n    our houses. I have seen,” he adds, “many cats very closely\r\n    resembling the wild cat, and one or two that could scarcely be\r\n    distinguished from it.” Mr. Blyth[89] remarks on this passage, “but\r\n    such cats are never seen in the southern parts of England; still,\r\n    as compared with any Indian tame cat, the affinity of the ordinary\r\n    British cat to _F. sylvestris_ is manifest; and due I suspect to\r\n    frequent intermixture at a time when the tame cat was first\r\n    introduced into Britain and continued rare, while the wild species\r\n    was far more abundant than at present.” In Hungary, Jeitteles[90]\r\n    was assured on trustworthy authority that a wild male cat crossed\r\n    with a female domestic cat, and that the hybrids long lived in a\r\n    domesticated state. In Algiers the domestic cat has crossed with\r\n    the wild cat (_F. lybica_) of that country.[91] In South Africa as\r\n    Mr. E. Layard informs me, the domestic cat intermingles freely with\r\n    the wild _F. caffra_; he has seen a pair of hybrids which were\r\n    quite tame and particularly attached to the lady who brought them\r\n    up; and Mr. Fry has found that these hybrids are fertile. In India\r\n    the domestic cat, according to Mr. Blyth, has crossed with four\r\n    Indian species. With respect to one of these species, _F. chaus,_\r\n    an excellent observer, Sir W. Elliot, informs me that he once\r\n    killed, near Madras, a wild brood, which were evidently hybrids\r\n    from the domestic cat; these young animals had a thick lynx-like\r\n    tail and the broad brown bar on the inside of the forearm\r\n    characteristic of _F. chaus._ Sir W. Elliot adds that he has often\r\n    observed this same mark on the forearms of domestic cats in India.\r\n    Mr. Blyth states that domestic cats coloured nearly like _ F.\r\n    chaus,_ but not resembling that species in shape, abound in Bengal;\r\n    he adds, “such a colouration is utterly unknown in European cats,\r\n    and the proper tabby markings (pale streaks on a black ground,\r\n    peculiarly and symmetrically disposed), so common in English cats,\r\n    are never seen in those of India.” Dr. D. Short has assured Mr.\r\n    Blyth[92] that, at Hansi, hybrids between the common cat and _F.\r\n    ornata_ (or _ torquata_) occur, “and that many of the domestic cats\r\n    of that part of India were undistinguishable from the wild _F.\r\n    ornata._” Azara states, but only on the authority of the\r\n    inhabitants, that in Paraguay the cat has crossed with two native\r\n    species. From these several cases we see that in Europe, Asia,\r\n    Africa, and America, the common cat, which lives a freer life than\r\n    most other domesticated animals, has crossed with various wild\r\n    species; and that in some instances the crossing has been\r\n    sufficiently frequent to affect the character of the breed.\r\n\r\nWhether domestic cats have descended from several distinct species, or\r\nhave only been modified by occasional crosses, their fertility, as far\r\nas is known, is unimpaired. The large Angora or Persian cat is the most\r\ndistinct in structure and habits of all the domestic breeds; and is\r\nbelieved by Pallas, but on no distinct evidence, to be descended from\r\nthe _F. manul_ of middle Asia; and I am assured by Mr. Blyth that the\r\nAngora cat breeds freely with Indian cats, which, as we have already\r\nseen, have apparently been much crossed with _F. chaus._ In England\r\nhalf-bred Angora cats are perfectly fertile with one another.\r\n\r\n    Within the same country we do not meet with distinct races of the\r\n    cat, as we do of dogs and of most other domestic animals; though\r\n    the cats of the same country present a considerable amount of\r\n    fluctuating variability. The explanation obviously is that, from\r\n    their nocturnal and rambling habits, indiscriminate crossing cannot\r\n    without much trouble be prevented. Selection cannot be brought into\r\n    play to produce distinct breeds, or to keep those distinct which\r\n    have been imported from foreign lands. On the other hand, in\r\n    islands and in countries completely separated from each other, we\r\n    meet with breeds more or less distinct; and these cases are worth\r\n    giving, showing that the scarcity of distinct races in the same\r\n    country is not caused by a deficiency of variability in the animal.\r\n    The tailless cats of the Isle of Man are said to differ from common\r\n    cats not only in the want of a tail, but in the greater length of\r\n    their hind legs, in the size of their heads, and in habits. The\r\n    Creole cat of Antigua, as I am informed by Mr. Nicholson, is\r\n    smaller, and has a more elongated head, than the British cat. In\r\n    Ceylon, as Mr. Thwaites writes to me, every one at first notices\r\n    the different appearance of the native cat from the English animal;\r\n    it is of small size, with closely lying hairs; its head is small,\r\n    with a receding forehead; but the ears are large and sharp;\r\n    altogether it has what is there called a “low-caste” appearance.\r\n    Rengger[93] says that the domestic cat, which has been bred for 300\r\n    years in Paraguay, presents a striking difference from the European\r\n    cat; it is smaller by a fourth, has a more lanky body, its hair is\r\n    short, shining, scanty and lies close, especially on the tail: he\r\n    adds that the change has been less at Ascension, the capital of\r\n    Paraguay, owing to the continual crossing with newly imported cats;\r\n    and this fact well illustrates the importance of separation. The\r\n    conditions of life in Paraguay appear not to be highly favourable\r\n    to the cat, for, though they have run half-wild, they do not become\r\n    thoroughly feral, like so many other European animals. In another\r\n    part of South America, according to Roulin,[94] the introduced cat\r\n    has lost the habit of uttering its hideous nocturnal howl. The Rev.\r\n    W.D. Fox purchased a cat in Portsmouth, which he was told came from\r\n    the coast of Guinea; its skin was black and wrinkled, fur\r\n    bluish-grey and short, its ears rather bare, legs long, and whole\r\n    aspect peculiar. This “negro” cat was fertile with common cats. On\r\n    the opposite coast of Africa, at Mombas, Captain Owen,  R.N.,[95]\r\n    states that all the cats are covered with short stiff hair instead\r\n    of fur: he gives a curious account of a cat from Algoa Bay, which\r\n    had been kept for some time on board and could be identified with\r\n    certainty; this animal was left for only eight weeks at Mombas, but\r\n    during that short period it “underwent a complete metamorphosis,\r\n    having parted with its sandy-coloured fur.” A cat from the Cape of\r\n    Good Hope has been described by Desmarest as remarkable from a red\r\n    stripe extending along the whole length of its back. Throughout an\r\n    immense area, namely, the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu, and\r\n    Burmah, all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper\r\n    length,[96] often with a sort of knot at the end. In the Caroline\r\n    archipelago the cats have very long legs, and are of a\r\n    reddish-yellow colour.[97] In China a breed has drooping ears. At\r\n    Tobolsk, according to Gmelin, there is a red-coloured breed. In\r\n    Asia, also, we find the well-known Angora or Persian breed.\r\n\r\n    The domestic cat has run wild in several countries, and everywhere\r\n    assumes, as far as can be judged by the short recorded\r\n    descriptions, a uniform character. Near Maldonado, in La Plata, I\r\n    shot one which seemed perfectly wild; it was carefully examined by\r\n    Mr. Waterhouse,[98] who found nothing remarkable in it, excepting\r\n    its great size. In New Zealand according to Dieffenbach, the feral\r\n    cats assume a streaky grey colour like that of wild cats; and this\r\n    is the case with the half-wild cats of the Scotch Highlands.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that distant countries possess distinct domestic races of\r\nthe cat. The differences may be in part due to descent from several\r\naboriginal species, or at least to crosses with them. In some cases, as\r\nin Paraguay, Mombas, and Antigua, the differences seem due to the\r\ndirect action of different conditions of life. In other cases some\r\nslight effect may possibly be attributed to natural selection, as cats\r\nin many cases have largely to support themselves and to escape diverse\r\ndangers. But man, owing to the difficulty of pairing cats, has done\r\nnothing by methodical selection; and probably very little by\r\nunintentional selection; though in each litter he generally saves the\r\nprettiest, and values most a good breed of mouse- or rat-catchers.\r\nThose cats which have a strong tendency to prowl after game, generally\r\nget destroyed by traps. As cats are so much petted, a breed bearing the\r\nsame relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear to larger dogs, would\r\nhave been much valued; and if selection could have been applied, we\r\nshould certainly have had many breeds in each long-civilised country,\r\nfor there is plenty of variability to work upon.\r\n\r\n    We see in this country considerable diversity in size, some in the\r\n    proportions of the body, and extreme variability in colouring. I\r\n    have only lately attended to this subject, but have already heard\r\n    of some singular cases of variation; one of a cat born in the West\r\n    Indies toothless, and remaining so all its life. Mr. Tegetmeier has\r\n    shown me the skull of a female cat with its canines so much\r\n    developed that they protruded uncovered beyond the lips; the tooth\r\n    with the fang being .95, and the part projecting from the gum .6 of\r\n    an inch in length. I have heard of several families of six-toed\r\n    cats, in one of which the peculiarity had been transmitted for at\r\n    least three generations. The tail varies greatly in length; I have\r\n    seen a cat which always carried its tail flat on its back when\r\n    pleased. The ears vary in shape, and certain strains, in England,\r\n    inherit a pencil-like tuft of hairs, above a quarter of an inch in\r\n    length, on the tips of their ears; and this same peculiarity,\r\n    according to Mr. Blyth, characterises some cats in India. The great\r\n    variability in the length of the tail and the lynx-like tufts of\r\n    hairs on the ears are apparently analogous to differences in\r\n    certain wild species of the genus. A much more important\r\n    difference, according to Daubenton,[99] is that the intestines of\r\n    domestic cats are wider, and a third longer, than in wild cats of\r\n    the same size; and this apparently has been by their less strictly\r\n    carnivorous diet.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Owen ‘British Fossil Mammals,’ pp. 123 to 133.

De Blainville in his ‘Ostéographie,\r\n Canidæ,’ p. 142, has largely discussed the whole subject, and\r\n concludes that the extinct parent of all domesticated dogs came\r\n nearest to the wolf in organisation, and to the jackal in habits. _See\r\n also_ Boyd Dawkins, ‘Cave Hunting,’ 1874, p. 131, etc., and his other\r\n publications.

Martin adopts it in his excellent ‘History of\r\n the Dog,’ 1845; as does Dr. Morton, as well as Nott and Gliddon, in\r\n the United States. Prof. Low, in his ‘Domesticated Animals,’ 1845, p.\r\n 666, comes to this same conclusion. No one has argued on this side\r\n with more clearness and force than the late James Wilson, of\r\n Edinburgh, in various papers read before the Highland Agricultural and\r\n Wernerian Societies. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (‘Hist. Nat.\r\n Gén.,’ 1860, tom. iii. p. 107), though he believes that most dogs have\r\n descended from the jackal, yet inclines to the belief that some are\r\n descended from the wolf. Prof. Gervais (‘Hist. Nat. Mamm.’ 1855, tom.\r\n ii. p. 69, referring to the view that all the domestic races are the\r\n modified descendants of a single species, after a long discussion,\r\n says, “Cette opinion est, suivant nous du moins, la moins probable.”\r\n\r\n [3] Berjeau, ‘The Varieties of the Dog; in old Sculptures and\r\n Pictures,’ 1863. ‘Der Hund,’ von Dr. F.

Seeman in his ‘Voyage of H.M.S. _Herald_,’ 1853, vol. ii. p.\r\n 26, says the wolf is often caught by the Esquimaux for the purpose of\r\n crossing with their dogs, and thus adding to their size and strength.\r\n M.

Transact.,’ 1789, p. 160) apparently was sixty-three days,\r\n for she received the dog more than once. The period of a mongrel dog\r\n and jackal was fifty-nine days. Fred. Cuvier found the period of\r\n gestation of the wolf to be (‘Dict. Class. d’Hist. Nat.’ tom. iv. p.\r\n 8) two months and a few days, which agrees with the dog.

BREEDS OF—COLOUR OF—LEG- AND SHOULDER-STRIPES—SHOULDER-STRIPES\r\nSOMETIMES ABSENT, SOMETIMES FORKED.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The history of the Horse is lost in antiquity. Remains of this\r\n    animal in a domesticated condition have been found in the Swiss\r\n    lake-dwellings, belonging to the Neolithic period.[1] At the\r\n    present time the number of breeds is great, as may be seen by\r\n    consulting any treatise on the Horse.[2] Looking only to the native\r\n    ponies of Great Britain, those of the Shetland Isles, Wales, the\r\n    New Forest, and Devonshire are distinguishable; and so it is,\r\n    amongst other instances, with each separate island in the great\r\n    Malay archipelago.[3] Some of the breeds present great differences\r\n    in size, shape of ears, length of mane, proportions of the body,\r\n    form of the withers and hind quarters, and especially in the head.\r\n    Compare the race-horse, dray-horse, and a Shetland pony in size,\r\n    configuration, and disposition; and see how much greater the\r\n    difference is than between the seven or eight other living species\r\n    of the genus Equus.\r\n\r\n    Of individual variations not known to characterise particular\r\n    breeds, and not great or injurious enough to be called\r\n    monstrosities, I have not collected many cases. Mr. G. Brown, of\r\n    the Cirencester Agricultural College, who has particularly attended\r\n    to the dentition of our domestic animals, writes to me that he has\r\n    “several times noticed eight permanent incisors instead of six in\r\n    the jaw.” Male horses only should have canines, but they are\r\n    occasionally found in the mare, though a small size.[4] The number\r\n    of ribs on each side is properly eighteen, but Youatt[5] asserts\r\n    that not unfrequently there are nineteen, the additional one being\r\n    always the posterior rib. It is a remarkable fact that the ancient\r\n    Indian horse is said in the Rig-Vêda to have only seventeen ribs;\r\n    and M. Piétrement,[6] who has called attention to this subject,\r\n    gives various reasons for placing full trust in this statement,\r\n    more especially as during former times the Hindoos carefully\r\n    counted the bones of animals. I have seen several notices of\r\n    variations in the bones of the leg; thus Mr. Price[7] speaks of an\r\n    additional bone in the hock, and of certain abnormal appearances\r\n    between the tibia and astragalus, as quite common in Irish horses,\r\n    and not due to disease. Horses have often been observed, according\r\n    to M. Gaudry,[8] to possess a trapezium and a rudiment of a fifth\r\n    metacarpal bone, so that “one sees appearing by monstrosity, in the\r\n    foot of the horse, structures which normally exist in the foot of\r\n    the Hipparion,”—an allied and extinct animal. In various countries\r\n    horn-like projections have been observed on the frontal bones of\r\n    the horse: in one case described by Mr. Percival they arose about\r\n    two inches above the orbital processes, and were “very like those\r\n    in a calf from five to six months old,” being from half to\r\n    three-quarters of an inch in length.[9] Azara has described two\r\n    cases in South America in which the projections were between three\r\n    and four inches in length: other instances have occurred in Spain.\r\n\r\n    That there has been much inherited variation in the horse cannot be\r\n    doubted, when we reflect on the number of the breeds existing\r\n    throughout the world or even within the same country, and when we\r\n    know that they have largely increased in number since the earliest\r\n    known records.[10] Even in so fleeting a character as colour,\r\n    Hofacker[11] found that, out of 216 cases in which horses of the\r\n    same colour were paired, only eleven pairs produced foals of a\r\n    quite different colour. As Professor Low[12] has remarked, the\r\n    English race-horse offers the best possible evidence of\r\n    inheritance. The pedigree of a race-horse is of more value in\r\n    judging of its probable success than its appearance: “King Herod”\r\n    gained in prizes 201,505 pounds sterling, and begot 497 winners;\r\n    “Eclipse” begot 334 winners.\r\n\r\n    Whether the whole amount of difference between the various breeds\r\n    has arisen under domestication is doubtful. From the fertility of\r\n    the most distinct breeds[13] when crossed, naturalists have\r\n    generally looked at all the breeds as having descended from a\r\n    single species. Few will agree with Colonel H. Smith, who believes\r\n    that they have descended from no less than five primitive and\r\n    differently coloured stocks.[14] But as several species and\r\n    varieties of the horse existed[15] during the later tertiary\r\n    periods, and as Rutimeyer found differences in the size and form of\r\n    the skull in the earliest known domesticated horses,[16] we ought\r\n    not to feel sure that all our breeds are descended from a single\r\n    species. The savages of North and South America easily reclaim the\r\n    feral horses, so that there is no improbability in savages in\r\n    various quarters of the world having domesticated more than one\r\n    native species or natural race. M. Sanson[17] thinks that he has\r\n    proved that two distinct species have been domesticated, one in the\r\n    East, and one in North Africa; and that these differed in the\r\n    number of their lumbar vertebra and in various other parts; but M.\r\n    Sanson seems to believe that osteological characters are subject to\r\n    very little variation, which is certainly a mistake. At present no\r\n    aboriginal or truly wild horse is positively known to exist; for it\r\n    is commonly believed that the wild horses of the East are escaped\r\n    domestic animals.[18] If therefore our domestic breeds are\r\n    descended from several species or natural races, all have become\r\n    extinct in the wild state.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the causes of the modifications which horses have\r\n    undergone, the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable\r\n    direct effect. Mr. D. Forbes, who has had excellent opportunities\r\n    of comparing the horses of Spain with those of South America,\r\n    informs me that the horses of Chile, which have lived under nearly\r\n    the same conditions as their progenitors in Andalusia, remain\r\n    unaltered, whilst the Pampas horses and the Puno horses are\r\n    considerably modified. There can be no doubt that horses become\r\n    greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living on\r\n    mountains and islands; and this apparently is due to want of\r\n    nutritious or varied food. Every one knows how small and rugged the\r\n    ponies are on the Northern islands and on the mountains of Europe.\r\n    Corsica and Sardinia have their native ponies; and there were,[19]\r\n    or still are, on some islands on the coast of Virginia, ponies like\r\n    those of the Shetland Islands, which are believed to have\r\n    originated through exposure to unfavourable conditions. The Puno\r\n    ponies, which inhabit the lofty regions of the Cordillera, are, as\r\n    I hear from Mr. D. Forbes, strange little creatures, very unlike\r\n    their Spanish progenitors. Further south, in the Falkland Islands,\r\n    the offspring of the horses imported in 1764 have already so much\r\n    deteriorated in size[20] and strength that they are unfitted for\r\n    catching wild cattle with the lasso; so that fresh horses have to\r\n    be brought for this purpose from La Plata at a great expense. The\r\n    reduced size of the horses bred on both southern and northern\r\n    islands, and on several mountain-chains, can hardly have been\r\n    caused by the cold, as a similar reduction has occurred on the\r\n    Virginian and Mediterranean islands. The horse can withstand\r\n    intense cold, for wild troops live on the plains of Siberia under\r\n    lat. 56°,[21] and aboriginally the horses must have inhabited\r\n    countries annually covered with snow, for he long retains the\r\n    instinct of scraping it away to get at the herbage beneath. The\r\n    wild tarpans in the East have this instinct; and so it is, as I am\r\n    informed by Admiral Sulivan, with the horses recently and formerly\r\n    introduced into the Falkland Islands from La Plata, some of which\r\n    have run wild; this latter fact is remarkable, as the progenitors\r\n    of these horses could not have followed this instinct during many\r\n    generations in La Plata. On the other hand, the wild cattle of the\r\n    Falklands never scrape away the snow, and perish when the ground is\r\n    long covered. In the northern parts of America the horses descended\r\n    from those introduced by the Spanish conquerors of Mexico, have the\r\n    same habit, as have the native bisons, but not so the cattle\r\n    introduced from Europe.[22]\r\n\r\n    The horse can flourish under intense heat as well as under intense\r\n    cold, for he is known to come to the highest perfection, though not\r\n    attaining a large size, in Arabia and northern Africa. Much\r\n    humidity is apparently more injurious to the horse than heat or\r\n    cold. In the Falkland Islands, horses suffer much from the\r\n    dampness; and this circumstance may perhaps partly account for the\r\n    singular fact that to the eastward of the Bay of Bengal,[23] over\r\n    an enormous and humid area, in Ava, Pegu, Siam, the Malayan\r\n    archipelago, the Loo Choo Islands, and a large part of China, no\r\n    full-sized horse is found. When we advance as far eastward as\r\n    Japan, the horse reacquires his full size.[24]\r\n\r\n    With most of our domesticated animals, some breeds are kept on\r\n    account of their curiosity or beauty; but the horse is valued\r\n    almost solely for its utility. Hence semi-monstrous breeds are not\r\n    preserved; and probably all the existing breeds have been slowly\r\n    formed either by the direct action of the conditions of life, or\r\n    through the selection of individual differences. No doubt\r\n    semi-monstrous breeds might have been formed: thus Mr. Waterton\r\n    records[25] the case of a mare which produced successively three\r\n    foals without tails; so that a tailless race might have been formed\r\n    like the tailless races of dogs and cats. A Russian breed of horses\r\n    is said to have curled hair, and Azara[26] relates that in Paraguay\r\n    horses are occasionally born, but are generally destroyed, with\r\n    hair like that on the head of a negro; and this peculiarity is\r\n    transmitted even to half-breeds: it is a curious case of\r\n    correlation that such horses have short manes and tails, and their\r\n    hoofs are of a peculiar shape like those of a mule.\r\n\r\n    It is scarcely possible to doubt that the long-continued selection\r\n    of qualities serviceable to man has been the chief agent in the\r\n    formation of the several breeds of the horse. Look at a dray-horse,\r\n    and see how well adapted he is to draw heavy weights, and how\r\n    unlike in appearance to any allied wild animal. The English\r\n    race-horse is known to be derived from the commingled blood of\r\n    Arabs, Turks, and Barbs; but selection, which was carried on during\r\n    very early times in England,[27] together with training, have made\r\n    him a very different animal from his parent-stocks. As a writer in\r\n    India, who evidently knows the pure Arab well, asks, who now,\r\n    “looking at our present breed of race-horses, could have conceived\r\n    that they were the result of the union of the Arab horse and\r\n    African mare?” The improvement is so marked that in running for the\r\n    Goodwood Cup the first descendants of Arabian, Turkish, and Persian\r\n    horses, are allowed a discount of 18 pounds weight; and when both\r\n    parents are of these countries a discount of 36 pounds.[28] It is\r\n    notorious that the Arabs have long been as careful about the\r\n    pedigree of their horses as we are, and this implies great and\r\n    continued care in breeding. Seeing what has been done in England by\r\n    careful breeding, can we doubt that the Arabs must likewise have\r\n    produced during the course of centuries a marked effect on the\r\n    qualities of their horses? But we may go much farther back in time,\r\n    for in the Bible we hear of studs carefully kept for breeding, and\r\n    of horses imported at high prices from various countries.[29] We\r\n    may therefore conclude that, whether or not the various existing\r\n    breeds of the horse have proceeded from one or more aboriginal\r\n    stocks, yet that a great amount of change has resulted from the\r\n    direct action of the conditions of life, and probably a still\r\n    greater amount from the long-continued selection by man of slight\r\n    individual differences.\r\n\r\n    With several domesticated quadrupeds and birds, certain coloured\r\n    marks are either strongly inherited or tend to reappear after\r\n    having been lost for a long time. As this subject will hereafter be\r\n    seen to be of importance, I will give a full account of the\r\n    colouring of horses. All English breeds, however unlike in size and\r\n    appearance, and several of those in India and the Malay\r\n    archipelago, present a similar range and diversity of colour. The\r\n    English race-horse, however, is said[30] never to be dun-coloured;\r\n    but as dun and cream-coloured horses are considered by the Arabs as\r\n    worthless, “and fit only for Jews to ride,”[31] these tints may\r\n    have been removed by long-continued selection. Horses of every\r\n    colour, and of such widely different kinds as dray-horses, cobs,\r\n    and ponies, are all occasionally dappled,[32] in the same manner as\r\n    is so conspicuous with grey horses. This fact does not throw any\r\n    clear light on the colouring of the aboriginal horse, but is a case\r\n    of analogous variation, for even asses are sometimes dappled, and I\r\n    have seen, in the British Museum, a hybrid from the ass and zebra\r\n    dappled on its hinder quarters. By the expression analogous\r\n    variation (and it is one that I shall often have occasion to use) I\r\n    mean a variation occurring in a species or variety which resembles\r\n    a normal character in another and distinct species or variety.\r\n    Analogous variations may arise, as will be explained in a future\r\n    chapter, from two or more forms with a similar constitution having\r\n    been exposed to similar conditions,—or from one of two forms having\r\n    reacquired through reversion a character inherited by the other\r\n    form from their common progenitor,—or from both forms having\r\n    reverted to the same ancestral character. We shall immediately see\r\n    that horses occasionally exhibit a tendency to become striped over\r\n    a large part of their bodies; and as we know that in the varieties\r\n    of the domestic cat and in several feline species stripes readily\r\n    pass into spots and cloudy marks—even the cubs of the\r\n    uniformly-coloured lion being spotted with dark marks on a lighter\r\n    ground—we may suspect that the dappling of the horse, which has\r\n    been noticed by some authors with surprise, is a modification or\r\n    vestige of a tendency to become striped.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 1.—Dun Devonshire Pony, with shoulder, spinal, and\r\nleg stripes.\r\n\r\n    This tendency in the horse to become striped is in several respects\r\n    an interesting fact. Horses of all colours, of the most diverse\r\n    breeds, in various parts of the world, often have a dark stripe\r\n    extending along the spine, from the mane to the tail; but this is\r\n    so common that I need enter into no particulars.[33] Occasionally\r\n    horses are transversely barred on the legs, chiefly on the under\r\n    side; and more rarely they have a distinct stripe on the shoulder,\r\n    like that on the shoulder of the ass, or a broad dark patch\r\n    representing a stripe. Before entering on any details I must\r\n    premise that the term dun-coloured is vague, and includes three\r\n    groups of colours, viz., that between cream-colour and\r\n    reddish-brown, which graduates into light-bay or\r\n    light-chestnut—this, I believe is often called fallow-dun;\r\n    secondly, leaden or slate-colour or mouse-dun, which graduates into\r\n    an ash-colour; and, lastly, dark-dun, between brown and black. In\r\n    England I have examined a rather large, lightly-built, fallow-dun\r\n    Devonshire pony (Figure 1), with a conspicuous stripe along the\r\n    back, with light transverse stripes on the under sides of its front\r\n    legs, and with four parallel stripes on each shoulder. Of these\r\n    four stripes the posterior one was very minute and faint; the\r\n    anterior one, on the other hand, was long and broad, but\r\n    interrupted in the middle, and truncated at its lower extremity,\r\n    with the anterior angle produced into a long tapering point. I\r\n    mention this latter fact because the shoulder-stripe of the ass\r\n    occasionally presents exactly the same appearance. I have had an\r\n    outline and description sent to me of a small, purely-bred, light\r\n    fallow-dun Welch pony, with a spinal stripe, a single transverse\r\n    stripe on each leg, and three shoulder-stripes; the posterior\r\n    stripe corresponding with that on the shoulder of the ass was the\r\n    longest, whilst the two anterior parallel stripes, arising from the\r\n    mane, decreased in length, in a reversed manner as compared with\r\n    the shoulder-stripes on the above-described Devonshire pony. I have\r\n    seen a bright fallow-dun cob, with its front legs transversely\r\n    barred on the under sides in the most conspicuous manner; also a\r\n    dark-leaden mouse-coloured pony with similar leg stripes, but much\r\n    less conspicuous; also a bright fallow-dun colt, fully three-parts\r\n    thoroughbred, with very plain transverse stripes on the legs; also\r\n    a chestnut-dun cart-horse with a conspicuous spinal stripe, with\r\n    distinct traces of shoulder-stripes, but none on the legs; I could\r\n    add other cases. My son made a sketch for me of a large, heavy,\r\n    Belgian cart-horse, of a fallow-dun, with a conspicuous spinal\r\n    stripe, traces of leg-stripes, and with two parallel (three inches\r\n    apart) stripes about seven or eight inches in length on both\r\n    shoulders. I have seen another rather light cart-horse, of a dirty\r\n    dark cream-colour, with striped legs, and on one shoulder a large\r\n    ill-defined dark cloudy patch, and on the opposite shoulder two\r\n    parallel faint stripes. All the cases yet mentioned are duns of\r\n    various tints; but Mr. W. W. Edwards has seen a nearly thoroughbred\r\n    chestnut horse which had the spinal stripe, and distinct bars on\r\n    the legs; and I have seen two bay carriage-horses with black spinal\r\n    stripes; one of these horses had on each shoulder a light\r\n    shoulder-stripe, and the other had a broad back ill-defined stripe,\r\n    running obliquely half-way down each shoulder; neither had\r\n    leg-stripes.\r\n\r\n    The most interesting case which I have met with occurred in a colt\r\n    of my own breeding. A bay mare (descended from a dark-brown Flemish\r\n    mare by a light grey Turcoman horse) was put to Hercules, a\r\n    thoroughbred dark bay, whose sire (Kingston) and dam were both\r\n    bays. The colt ultimately turned out brown; but when only a\r\n    fortnight old it was a dirty bay, shaded with mouse-grey, and in\r\n    parts with a yellowish tint: it had only a trace of the spinal\r\n    stripe, with a few obscure transverse bars on the legs; but almost\r\n    the whole body was marked with very narrow dark stripes, in most\r\n    parts so obscure as to be visible only in certain lights, like the\r\n    stripes which may be seen on black kittens. These stripes were\r\n    distinct on the hind-quarters, where they diverged from the spine,\r\n    and pointed a little forwards; many of them as they diverged became\r\n    a little branched, exactly in the same manner as in some zebrine\r\n    species. The stripes were plainest on the forehead between the\r\n    ears, where they formed a set of pointed arches, one under the\r\n    other, decreasing in size downwards towards the muzzle; exactly\r\n    similar marks may be seen on the forehead of the quagga and\r\n    Burchell’s zebra. When this foal was two or three months old all\r\n    the stripes entirely disappeared. I have seen similar marks on the\r\n    forehead of a fully grown, fallow-dun, cob-like horse, having a\r\n    conspicuous spinal stripe, and with its front legs well barred.\r\n\r\n    In Norway the colour of the native horse or pony is dun, varying\r\n    from almost cream-colour to dark-mouse dun; and an animal is not\r\n    considered purely bred unless it has the spinal and\r\n    leg-stripes.[34] My son estimated that about a third of the ponies\r\n    which he saw there had striped legs; he counted seven stripes on\r\n    the fore-legs and two on the hind-legs of one pony; only a few of\r\n    them exhibited traces of shoulder stripes; but I have heard of a\r\n    cob imported from Norway which had the shoulder as well as the\r\n    other stripes well developed. Colonel H. Smith[35] alludes to\r\n    dun-horses with the spinal stripe in the Sierras of Spain; and the\r\n    horses originally derived from Spain, in some parts of South\r\n    America, are now duns. Sir W. Elliot informs me that he inspected a\r\n    herd of 300 South American horses imported into Madras, and many of\r\n    these had transverse stripes on the legs and short\r\n    shoulder-stripes; the most strongly marked individual, of which a\r\n    coloured drawing was sent me, was a mouse-dun, with the\r\n    shoulder-stripes slightly forked.\r\n\r\n    In the North-Western parts of India striped horses of more than one\r\n    breed are apparently commoner than in any other part of the world;\r\n    and I have received information respecting them from several\r\n    officers, especially from Colonel Poole, Colonel Curtis, Major\r\n    Campbell, Brigadier St. John, and others. The Kattywar horses are\r\n    often fifteen or sixteen hands in height, and are well but lightly\r\n    built. They are of all colours, but the several kinds of duns\r\n    prevail; and these are so generally striped, that a horse without\r\n    stripes is not considered pure. Colonel Poole believes that all the\r\n    duns have the spinal stripe, the leg-stripes are generally present,\r\n    and he thinks that about half the horses have the shoulder-stripe;\r\n    this stripe is sometimes double or treble on both shoulders.\r\n    Colonel Poole has often seen stripes on the cheeks and sides of the\r\n    nose. He has seen stripes on the grey and bay Kattywars when first\r\n    foaled, but they soon faded away. I have received other accounts of\r\n    cream-coloured, bay, brown, and grey Kattywar horses being striped.\r\n    Eastward of India, the Shan (north of Burmah) ponies, as I am\r\n    informed by Mr. Blyth, have spinal, leg, and shoulder stripes. Sir\r\n    W. Elliot informs me that he saw two bay Pegu ponies with\r\n    leg-stripes. Burmese and Javanese ponies are frequently\r\n    dun-coloured, and have the three kinds of stripes, “in the same\r\n    degree as in England.”[36] Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he examined\r\n    two light-dun ponies of two Chinese breeds, viz., those of Shanghai\r\n    and Amoy; both had the spinal stripe, and the latter an indistinct\r\n    shoulder-stripe.\r\n\r\n    We thus see that in all parts of the world breeds of the horse as\r\n    different as possible, when of a dun-colour (including under this\r\n    term a wide range of tint from cream to dusty black), and rarely\r\n    when almost white tinged with yellow, grey, bay, and chestnut, have\r\n    the several above-specified stripes. Horses which are of a yellow\r\n    colour with white mane and tail, and which are sometimes called\r\n    duns, I have never seen with stripes.[37]\r\n\r\n    From reasons which will be apparent in the chapter on Reversion, I\r\n    have endeavoured, but with poor success, to discover whether duns,\r\n    which are so much oftener striped than other coloured horses, are\r\n    ever produced from the crossing of two horses, neither of which are\r\n    duns. Most persons to whom I have applied believe that one parent\r\n    must be dun; and it is generally asserted that, when this is the\r\n    case, the dun-colour and the stripes are strongly inherited.[38]\r\n    One case, however, has fallen under my own observation of a foal\r\n    from a black mare by a bay horse, which when fully grown was a dark\r\n    fallow-dun and had a narrow but plain spinal stripe. Hofacker[39]\r\n    gives two instances of mouse-duns (Mausrapp) being produced from\r\n    two parents of different colours and neither duns.\r\n\r\n    The stripes of all kinds are generally plainer in the foal than in\r\n    the adult horse, being commonly lost at the first shedding of the\r\n    hair.[40] Colonel Poole believes that “the stripes in the Kattywar\r\n    breed are plainest when the colt is first foaled; they then become\r\n    less and less distinct till after the first coat is shed, when they\r\n    come out as strongly as before; but certainly often fade away as\r\n    the age of the horse increases.” Two other accounts confirm this\r\n    fading of the stripes in old horses in India. One writer, on the\r\n    other hand, states that colts are often born without stripes, but\r\n    that they appear as the colt grows older. Three authorities affirm\r\n    that in Norway the stripes are less plain in the foal than in the\r\n    adult. In the case described by me of the young foal which was\r\n    narrowly striped over nearly all its body, there was no doubt about\r\n    the early and complete disappearance of the stripes. Mr. W. W.\r\n    Edwards examined for me twenty-two foals of race-horses, and twelve\r\n    had the spinal stripe more or less plain; this fact, and some other\r\n    accounts which I have received, lead me to believe that the spinal\r\n    stripe often disappears in the English race-horse when old. With\r\n    natural species, the young often exhibit characters which disappear\r\n    at maturity.\r\n\r\nThe stripes are variable in colour, but are always darker than the rest\r\nof the body. They do not by any means always coexist on the different\r\nparts of the body: the legs may be striped without any shoulder-stripe,\r\nor the converse case, which is rarer, may occur; but I have never heard\r\nof either shoulder or leg-stripes without the spinal stripe. The latter\r\nis by far the commonest of all the stripes, as might have been\r\nexpected, as it characterises the other seven or eight species of the\r\ngenus. It is remarkable that so trifling a character as the\r\nshoulder-stripe being double or triple should occur in such different\r\nbreeds as Welch and Devonshire ponies, the Shan pony, heavy\r\ncart-horses, light South American horses, and the lanky Kattywar breed.\r\nColonel Hamilton Smith believes that one of his five supposed primitive\r\nstocks was dun-coloured and striped; and that the stripes in all the\r\nother breeds result from ancient crosses with this one primitive dun;\r\nbut it is extremely improbable that different breeds living in such\r\ndistant quarters of the world should all have been crossed with any one\r\naboriginally distinct stock. Nor have we any reason to believe that the\r\neffects of a cross at a very remote period would be propagated for so\r\nmany generations as is implied on this view.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the primitive colour of the horse having been dun,\r\n    Colonel Hamilton Smith[41] has collected a large body of evidence\r\n    showing that this tint was common in the East as far back as the\r\n    time of Alexander, and that the wild horses of Western Asia and\r\n    Eastern Europe now are, or recently were, of various shades of dun.\r\n    It seems that not very long ago a wild breed of dun-coloured horses\r\n    with a spinal stripe was preserved in the royal parks in Prussia. I\r\n    hear from Hungary that the inhabitants of that country look at the\r\n    duns with a spinal stripe as the aboriginal stock, and so it is in\r\n    Norway. Dun-coloured ponies are not rare in the mountainous parts\r\n    of Devonshire, Wales, and Scotland, where the aboriginal breed\r\n    would have the best chance of being preserved. In South America in\r\n    the time of Azara, when the horse had been feral for about 250\r\n    years, 90 out of 100 horses were “bai-châtains,” and the remaining\r\n    ten were “zains,” that is brown; not more than one in 2000 being\r\n    black. In North America the feral horses show a strong tendency to\r\n    become roans of various shades; but in certain parts, as I hear\r\n    from Dr. Canfield, they are mostly duns and striped.[42]\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters on the Pigeon we shall see that a blue bird\r\nis occasionally produced by pure breeds of various colours and that\r\nwhen this occurs certain black marks invariably appear on the wings and\r\ntail; so again, when variously coloured breeds are crossed, blue birds\r\nwith the same black marks are frequently produced. We shall further see\r\nthat these facts are explained by, and afford strong evidence in favour\r\nof, the view that all the breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon, or\r\n_ Columba livia,_ which is thus coloured and marked. But the appearance\r\nof the stripes on the various breeds of the horse, when of a dun\r\ncolour, does not afford nearly such good evidence of their descent from\r\na single primitive stock as in the case of the pigeon: because no horse\r\ncertainly wild is known as a standard of comparison; because the\r\nstripes when they appear are variable in character; because there is\r\nfar from sufficient evidence that the crossing of distinct breeds\r\nproduces stripes, and lastly, because all the species of the genus\r\nEquus have the spinal stripe, and several species have shoulder and leg\r\nstripes. Nevertheless the similarity in the most distinct breeds in\r\ntheir general range of colour, in their dappling, and in the occasional\r\nappearance, especially in duns, of leg-stripes and of double or triple\r\nshoulder-stripes, taken together, indicate the probability of the\r\ndescent of all the existing races from a single, dun-coloured, more or\r\nless striped, primitive stock, to which our horses occasionally revert.\r\n\r\nTHE ASS.\r\n\r\n    Four species of Asses, besides three zebras, have been described by\r\n    naturalists. There is now little doubt that our domesticated animal\r\n    is descended from the _Equus tæniopus_ of Abyssinia.[43] The ass is\r\n    sometimes advanced as an instance of an animal domesticated, as we\r\n    know by the Old Testament, from an ancient period, which has varied\r\n    only in a very slight degree. But this is by no means strictly\r\n    true; for in Syria alone there are four breeds;[44] first, a light\r\n    and graceful animal, with an agreeable gait, used by ladies;\r\n    secondly, an Arab breed reserved exclusively for the saddle;\r\n    thirdly, a stouter animal used for ploughing and various purposes;\r\n    and lastly, the large Damascus breed, with a peculiarly long body\r\n    and ears. In the South of France also there are several breeds, and\r\n    one of extraordinary size, some individuals being as tall as\r\n    full-sized horses. Although the ass in England is by no means\r\n    uniform in appearance, distinct breeds have not been formed. This\r\n    may probably be accounted for by the animal being kept chiefly by\r\n    poor persons, who do not rear large numbers, nor carefully match\r\n    and select the young. For, as we shall see in a future chapter, the\r\n    ass can with ease be greatly improved in size and strength by\r\n    careful selection, combined no doubt with good food; and we may\r\n    infer that all its other characters would be equally amenable to\r\n    selection. The small size of the ass in England and Northern Europe\r\n    is apparently due far more to want of care in breeding than to\r\n    cold; for in Western India, where the ass is used as a beast of\r\n    burden by some of the lower castes, it is not much larger than a\r\n    Newfoundland dog, “being generally not more than from twenty to\r\n    thirty inches high.”[45]\r\n\r\n    The ass varies greatly in colour; and its legs, especially the\r\n    fore-legs, both in England and other countries—for instance, in\r\n    China—are occasionally barred more plainly than those of\r\n    dun-coloured horses. Thirteen or fourteen transverse stripes have\r\n    been counted on both the fore and hind legs. With the horse the\r\n    occasional appearance of leg-stripes was accounted for by reversion\r\n    to a supposed parent-form, and in the case of the ass we may\r\n    confidently believe in this explanation, as _E. tæniopus_ is known\r\n    to be barred, though only in a slight degree, and not quite\r\n    invariably. The stripes are believed to occur most frequently and\r\n    to be plainest on the legs of the domestic ass during early\r\n    youth,[46] as likewise occurs with the horse. The shoulder-stripe,\r\n    which is so eminently characteristic of the species, is\r\n    nevertheless variable in breadth, length, and manner of\r\n    termination. I have measured one four times as broad as another,\r\n    and some more than twice as long as others. In one light-grey ass\r\n    the shoulder-stripe was only six inches in length, and as thin as a\r\n    piece of string; and in another animal of the same colour there was\r\n    only a dusky shade representing a stripe. I have heard of three\r\n    white asses, not albinoes, with no trace of shoulder or spinal\r\n    stripes;[47] and I have seen nine other asses with no\r\n    shoulder-stripe, and some of them had no spinal stripe. Three of\r\n    the nine were light-greys, one a dark-grey, another grey passing\r\n    into reddish-roan, and the others were brown, two being tinted on\r\n    parts of their bodies with a reddish or bay shade. If therefore\r\n    grey and reddish-brown asses had been steadily selected and bred\r\n    from, the shoulder stripe would probably have been lost almost as\r\n    generally and completely as in the case of the horse.\r\n\r\n    The shoulder stripe on the ass is sometimes double, and Mr. Blyth\r\n    has seen even three or four parallel stripes.[48] I have observed\r\n    in ten cases shoulder-stripes abruptly truncated at the lower end,\r\n    with the anterior angle produced into a tapering point, precisely\r\n    as in the above dun Devonshire pony. I have seen three cases of the\r\n    terminal portion abruptly and angularly bent; and have seen and\r\n    heard of four cases of a distinct though slight forking of the\r\n    stripe. In Syria, Dr. Hooker and his party observed for me no less\r\n    than five similar instances of the shoulder-stripe plainly\r\n    bifurcating over the fore leg. In the common mule it likewise\r\n    sometimes bifurcates. When I first noticed the forking and angular\r\n    bending of the shoulder-stripe, I had seen enough of the stripes in\r\n    the various equine species to feel convinced that even a character\r\n    so unimportant as this had a distinct meaning, and was thus led to\r\n    attend to the subject. I now find that in the _E. burchellii_ and\r\n    _quagga,_ the stripe which corresponds with the shoulder-stripe of\r\n    the ass, as well as some of the stripes on the neck, bifurcate, and\r\n    that some of those near the shoulder have their extremities bent\r\n    angularly backwards. The bifurcation and angular bending of the\r\n    stripes on the shoulders apparently are connected with the nearly\r\n    upright stripes on the sides of the body and neck changing their\r\n    direction and becoming transverse on the legs. Finally, we see that\r\n    the presence of shoulder, leg, and spinal stripes in the horse,—\r\n    their occasional absence in the ass,—the occurrence of double and\r\n    triple shoulder-stripes in both animals, and the similar manner in\r\n    which these stripes terminate downwards,—are all cases of analogous\r\n    variation in the horse and ass. These cases are probably not due to\r\n    similar conditions acting on similar constitutions, but to a\r\n    partial reversion in colour to the common progenitor of the genus.\r\n    We shall hereafter return to this subject, and discuss it more\r\n    fully.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Rütimeyer ‘Fauna der Pfahlbauten,’ 1861, s. 122.\r\n\r\n [2] _See_ ‘Youatt on the Horse’: J.

One\r\n of the smallest ponies I ever saw, of the colour of a mouse, had a\r\n conspicuous spinal stripe. A small Indian chestnut pony had the same\r\n stripe, as had a remarkably heavy chestnut cart-horse. Race-horses\r\n often have the spinal stripe.\r\n\r\n [34] I have received information, through the kindness of the\r\n Consul-General, Mr. J. R.

This has been effected by Hermann von\r\n    Nathusius in two admirable works, especially in the later one on\r\n    the Skulls of the several races, and by Rütimeyer in his celebrated\r\n    Fauna of the ancient Swiss lake-dwellings.[1] Nathusius has shown\r\n    that all the known breeds may be divided into two great groups: one\r\n    resembling in all important respects and no doubt descended from\r\n    the common wild boar; so that this may be called the _Sus scrofa_\r\n    group. The other group differs in several important and constant\r\n    osteological characters; its wild parent-form is unknown; the name\r\n    given to it by Nathusius, according to the law of priority, is _\r\n    Sus indicus,_ of Pallas. This name must now be followed, though an\r\n    unfortunate one, as the wild aboriginal does not inhabit India, and\r\n    the best-known domesticated breeds have been imported from Siam and\r\n    China.\r\n\r\n    First for the _Sus scrofa_ breeds, or those resembling the common\r\n    wild boar. These still exist, according to Nathusius\r\n    (‘Schweineschädel’ s. 75), in various parts of central and northern\r\n    Europe; formerly every kingdom,[2] and almost every province in\r\n    Britain, possessed its own native breed; but these are now\r\n    everywhere rapidly disappearing, being replaced by improved breeds\r\n    crossed with the _S. indicus_ form. The skull in the breeds of the\r\n    _ S. scrofa_ type resembles, in all important respects, that of the\r\n    European wild boar; but it has become (‘Schweineschädel’ s. 63-68)\r\n    higher and broader relatively to its length; and the hinder part is\r\n    more upright. The differences, however, are all variable in degree.\r\n    The breeds which thus resemble _S. scrofa_ in their essential skull\r\n    characters differ conspicuously from each other in other respects,\r\n    as in the length of the ears and legs, curvature of the ribs,\r\n    colour, hairiness, size and proportions of the body.\r\n\r\n    The wild _Sus scrofa_ has a wide range, namely, Europe, North\r\n    Africa, as identified by osteological characters by Rütimeyer, and\r\n    Hindostan, as similarly identified by Nathusius. But the wild boars\r\n    inhabiting these several countries differ so much from each other\r\n    in external characters, that they have been ranked by some\r\n    naturalists as specifically distinct. Even within Hindostan these\r\n    animals, according to Mr. Blyth, form very distinct races in the\r\n    different districts; in the N. Western provinces, as I am informed\r\n    by the Rev. R. Everest, the boar never exceeds 36 inches in height,\r\n    whilst in Bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height. In\r\n    Europe, Northern Africa, and Hindostan, domestic pigs have been\r\n    known to cross with the wild native species;[3] and in Hindostan an\r\n    accurate observer,[4] Sir Walter Elliot, after describing the\r\n    differences between wild Indian and wild German boars, remarks that\r\n    “the same differences are perceptible in the domesticated\r\n    individuals of the two countries.” We may therefore conclude that\r\n    the breeds of the _Sus scrofa_ type are descended from, or have\r\n    been modified by crossing with, forms which may be ranked as\r\n    geographical races, but which, according to some naturalists, ought\r\n    to be ranked as distinct species.\r\n\r\nPigs of the _Sus indicus_ type are best known to Englishmen under the\r\nform of the Chinese breed. The skull of _S. indicus,_ as described by\r\nNathusius, differs from that of _S. scrofa_ in several minor respects,\r\nas in its greater breadth and in some details in the teeth; but chiefly\r\nin the shortness of the lachrymal bones, in the greater width of the\r\nfore part of the palate-bones, and in the divergence of the premolar\r\nteeth. It deserves especial notice that these latter characters are not\r\ngained, even in the least degree, by the domesticated forms of _S.\r\nscrofa._ After reading the remarks and descriptions given by Nathusius,\r\nit seems to me to be merely playing with words to doubt whether _S.\r\nindicus_ ought to be ranked as a species; for the above-specified\r\ndifferences are more strongly marked than any that can be pointed out\r\nbetween, for instance, the fox and the wolf, or the ass and the horse.\r\nAs already stated, _S. indicus_ is not known in a wild state; but its\r\ndomesticated forms, according to Nathusius, come near to _S. vittatus_\r\nof Java and some allied species. A pig found wild in the Aru islands\r\n(‘Schweineschädel’ s. 169) is apparently identical with _S. indicus_;\r\nbut it is doubtful whether this is a truly native animal. The\r\ndomesticated breeds of China, Cochin-China, and Siam belong to this\r\ntype. The Roman or Neapolitan breed, the Andalusian, the Hungarian, and\r\nthe “Krause” swine of Nathusius, inhabiting south-eastern Europe and\r\nTurkey, and having fine curly hair, and the small Swiss\r\n“Bündtnerschwein” of Rütimeyer, all agree in their more important\r\nskull-characters with _S. indicus,_ and, as is supposed, have all been\r\nlargely crossed with this form. Pigs of this type have existed during a\r\nlong period on the shores of the Mediterranean, for a figure\r\n(‘Schweineschädel’ s. 142) closely resembling the existing Neapolitan\r\npig was found in the buried city of Herculaneum.\r\n\r\n    Rütimeyer has made the remarkable discovery that there lived\r\n    contemporaneously in Switzerland, during the Neolithic period, two\r\n    domesticated forms, the _S. scrofa,_ and the _S. scrofa palustris_\r\n    or Torfschwein. Rütimeyer perceived that the latter approached the\r\n    Eastern breeds, and, according to Nathusius, it certainly belongs\r\n    to the _S. indicus_ group; but Rütimeyer has subsequently shown\r\n    that it differs in some well-marked characters. This author was\r\n    formerly convinced that his Torfschwein existed as a wild animal\r\n    during the first part of the Stone period, and was domesticated\r\n    during a later part of the same period.[5] Nathusius, whilst he\r\n    fully admits the curious fact first observed by Rütimeyer, that the\r\n    bones of domesticated and wild animals can be distinguished by\r\n    their different aspect, yet, from special difficulties in the case\r\n    of the bones of the pig (‘Schweineschädel’ s. 147), is not\r\n    convinced of the truth of the above conclusion; and Rütimeyer\r\n    himself seems now to feel some doubt. Other naturalists have also\r\n    argued strongly on the same side as Nathusius.[6]\r\n\r\n    Several breeds, differing in the proportions of the body, in the\r\n    length of the ears, in the nature of the hair, in colour, etc.,\r\n    come under the _S. indicus_ type. Nor is this surprising,\r\n    considering how ancient the domestication of this form has been\r\n    both in Europe and in China. In this latter country the date is\r\n    believed by an eminent Chinese scholar[7] to go back at least 4900\r\n    years from the present time. This same scholar alludes to the\r\n    existence of many local varieties of the pig in China; and at the\r\n    present time the Chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and\r\n    tending their pigs, not even allowing them to walk from place to\r\n    place.[8] Hence these pigs, as Nathusius has remarked,[9] display\r\n    in an eminent degree the characters of a highly-cultivated race,\r\n    and hence, no doubt, their high value in the improvement of our\r\n    European breeds. Nathusius makes a remarkable statement\r\n    (‘Schweineschädel’ s. 138), that the infusion of the 1/32nd, or\r\n    even of the 1/64th, part of the blood of _S. indicus_ into a breed\r\n    of _S. scrofa,_ is sufficient plainly to modify the skull of the\r\n    latter species. This singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by\r\n    several of the chief distinctive characters of _S. indicus,_ such\r\n    as the shortness of the lachrymal bones, etc., being common to\r\n    several species of the genus; for in crosses characters which are\r\n    common to many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those\r\n    appertaining to only a few species.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 2.—Head of Japan or Masked Pig.\r\n\r\n    The Japan pig (_S. pliciceps_ of Gray), which was formerly\r\n    exhibited in the Zoological Gardens, has an extraordinary\r\n    appearance from its short head, broad forehead and nose, great\r\n    fleshy ears, and deeply furrowed skin. Figure 2 is copied from that\r\n    given by Mr. Bartlett.[10] Not only is the face furrowed, but thick\r\n    folds of skin, which are harder than the other parts, almost like\r\n    the plates on the Indian rhinoceros, hang about the shoulders and\r\n    rump. It is coloured black, with white feet, and breeds true. That\r\n    it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt; and this\r\n    might have been inferred even from the fact that its young are not\r\n    longitudinally striped; for this is a character common to all the\r\n    species included within the genus _Sus_ and the allied genera\r\n    whilst in their natural state.[11] Dr. Gray[12] has described the\r\n    skull of this animal, which he ranks not only as a distinct\r\n    species, but places it in a distinct section of the genus.\r\n    Nathusius, however, after his careful study of the whole group,\r\n    states positively (‘Schweineschädel’ s. 153-158). that the skull in\r\n    all essential characters closely resembles that of the short-eared\r\n    Chinese breed of the _S. indicus_ type. Hence Nathusius considers\r\n    the Japan pig as only a domesticated variety of _S. indicus_: if\r\n    this really be the case, it is a wonderful instance of the amount\r\n    of modification which can be effected under domestication.\r\n\r\n    Formerly there existed in the central islands of the Pacific Ocean\r\n    a singular breed of pigs. These are described by the Rev. D.\r\n    Tyerman and G. Bennett[13] as of small size, hump-backed, with a\r\n    disproportionately long head, with short ears turned backwards,\r\n    with a bushy tail not more than two inches in length, placed as if\r\n    it grew from the back. Within half a century after the introduction\r\n    of European and Chinese pigs into these islands, the native breed,\r\n    according to the above authors, became almost completely lost by\r\n    being repeatedly crossed with them. Secluded islands, as might have\r\n    been expected, seem favourable for the production or retention of\r\n    peculiar breeds; thus, in the Orkney Islands, the hogs have been\r\n    described as very small, with erect and sharp ears, and “with an\r\n    appearance altogether different from the hogs brought from the\r\n    south.”[14]\r\n\r\nSeeing how different the Chinese pigs, belonging to the _Sus indicus_\r\ntype, are in their osteological characters and in external appearance\r\nfrom the pigs of the _S. scrofa_ type, so that they must be considered\r\nspecifically distinct, it is a fact well deserving attention, that\r\nChinese and common pigs have been repeatedly crossed in various\r\nmanners, with unimpaired fertility. One great breeder who had used pure\r\nChinese pigs assured me that the fertility of the half-breeds _inter\r\nse_ and of their recrossed progeny was actually increased; and this is\r\nthe general belief of agriculturists. Again, the Japan pig or _S.\r\npliciceps_ of Gray is so distinct in appearance from all common pigs,\r\nthat it stretches one’s belief to the utmost to admit that it is simply\r\na domestic variety; yet this breed has been found perfectly fertile\r\nwith the Berkshire breed; and Mr. Eyton informs me that he paired a\r\nhalf-bred brother and sister and found them quite fertile together.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 3—Head of Wild Boar, and of “Golden Days,” a pig of\r\nthe Yorkshire Large Breed\r\n\r\n    The modification of the skull in the most highly cultivated races\r\n    is wonderful. To appreciate the amount of change, Nathusius’ work,\r\n    with its excellent figures, should be studied. The whole of the\r\n    exterior in all its parts has been altered: the hinder surface,\r\n    instead of sloping backwards, is directed forwards, entailing many\r\n    changes in other parts; the front of the head is deeply concave;\r\n    the orbits have a different shape; the auditory meatus has a\r\n    different direction and shape; the incisors of the upper and lower\r\n    jaws do not touch each other, and they stand in both jaws beyond\r\n    the plane of the molars; the canines of the upper jaw stand in\r\n    front of those of the lower jaw, and this is a remarkable anomaly:\r\n    the articular surfaces of the occipital condyles are so greatly\r\n    changed in shape, that, as Nathusius remarks (s. 133), no\r\n    naturalist, seeing this important part of the skull by itself,\r\n    would suppose that it belonged to the genus Sus. These and various\r\n    other modifications, as Nathusius observes, can hardly be\r\n    considered as monstrosities, for they are not injurious, and are\r\n    strictly inherited. The whole head is much shortened; thus, whilst\r\n    in common breeds its length to that of the body is as 1 to 6, in\r\n    the “cultur-racen” the proportion is as 1 to 9, and even recently\r\n    as 1 to 11.[15] The following woodcut[16] of the head of a wild\r\n    boar and of a sow from a photograph of the Yorkshire Large Breed,\r\n    may aid in showing how greatly the head in a highly cultivated race\r\n    has been modified and shortened.\r\n\r\n    Nathusius has well discussed the causes of the remarkable changes\r\n    in the skull and shape of the body which the highly cultivated\r\n    races have undergone. These modifications occur chiefly in the pure\r\n    and crossed races of the _S. indicus_ type; but their commencement\r\n    may be clearly detected in the slightly improved breeds of the _S.\r\n    scrofa_ type.[17] Nathusius states positively (s. 99, 103), as the\r\n    result of common experience and of his experiments, that rich and\r\n    abundant food, given during youth, tends by some direct action to\r\n    make the head broader and shorter; and that poor food works a\r\n    contrary result. He lays much stress on the fact that all wild and\r\n    semi-domesticated pigs, in ploughing up the ground with their\r\n    muzzles, have, whilst young, to exert the powerful muscles fixed to\r\n    the hinder part of the head. In highly cultivated races this habit\r\n    is no longer followed, and consequently the back of the skull\r\n    becomes modified in shape, entailing other changes in other parts.\r\n    There can hardly be a doubt that so great a change in habits would\r\n    affect the skull; but it seems rather doubtful how far this will\r\n    account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and for its\r\n    concave front. It is well known (Nathusius himself advancing many\r\n    cases, s. 104) that there is a strong tendency in many domestic\r\n    animals—in bull- and pug-dogs, in the niata cattle, in sheep, in\r\n    Polish fowls, short-faced tumbler pigeons, and in one variety of\r\n    the carp—for the bones of the face to become greatly shortened. In\r\n    the case of the dog, as H. Müller has shown, this seems caused by\r\n    an abnormal state of the primordial cartilage. We may, however,\r\n    readily admit that abundant and rich food supplied during many\r\n    generations would give an inherited tendency to increased size of\r\n    body, and that, from disuse, the limbs would become finer and\r\n    shorter.[18] We shall in a future chapter see also that the skull\r\n    and limbs are apparently in some manner correlated, so that any\r\n    change in the one tends to affect the other.\r\n\r\n    Nathusius has remarked, and the observation is an interesting one,\r\n    that the peculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly\r\n    cultivated races is not characteristic of any one race, but is\r\n    common to all when improved up to the same standard. Thus the\r\n    large-bodied, long-eared, English breeds with a convex back, and\r\n    the small-bodied, short-eared, Chinese breeds with a concave back,\r\n    when bred to the same state of perfection, nearly resemble each\r\n    other in the form of the head and body. This result, it appears, is\r\n    partly due to similar causes of change acting on the several races,\r\n    and partly to man breeding the pig for one sole purpose, namely,\r\n    for the greatest amount of flesh and fat; so that selection has\r\n    always tended towards one and the same end. With most domestic\r\n    animals the result of selection has been divergence of character,\r\n    here it has been convergence.[19]\r\n\r\n    The nature of the food supplied during many generations has\r\n    apparently affected the length of the intestines; for, according to\r\n    Cuvier,[20] their length to that of the body in the wild boar is as\r\n    9 to 1,—in the common domestic boar as 13·5 to 1,—and in the Siam\r\n    breed as 16 to 1. In this latter breed the greater length may be\r\n    due either to descent from a distinct species or to more ancient\r\n    domestication. The number of mammæ vary, as does the period of\r\n    gestation. The latest authority says[21] that “the period averages\r\n    from 17 to 20 weeks,” but I think there must be some error in this\r\n    statement: in M. Tessier’s observations on 25 sows it varied from\r\n    109 to 123 days. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me ten carefully\r\n    recorded cases with well-bred pigs, in which the period varied from\r\n    101 to 116 days. According to Nathusius the period is shortest in\r\n    the races which come early to maturity; but the course of their\r\n    development does not appear to be actually shortened, for the young\r\n    animal is born, judging from the state of the skull, less fully\r\n    developed, or in a more embryonic condition,[22] than in the case\r\n    of common swine. In the highly cultivated and early matured races\r\n    the teeth, also, are developed earlier.\r\n\r\n    The difference in the number of the vertebræ and ribs in different\r\n    kinds of pigs, as observed by Mr. Eyton,[23] and as given in the\r\n    following table, has often been quoted. The African sow probably\r\n    belongs to the _S. scrofa_ type; and Mr. Eyton informs me that,\r\n    since the publication of this paper, cross-bred animals from the\r\n    African and English races were found by Lord Hill to be perfectly\r\n    fertile.\r\n\r\n\r\n               English\r\n          Long-legged\r\n          Male.

From the time of\r\n    Aristotle to the present time solid-hoofed swine have occasionally\r\n    been observed in various parts of the world. Although this\r\n    peculiarity is strongly inherited, it is hardly probable that all\r\n    the animals with solid hoofs have descended from the same parents;\r\n    it is more probable that the same peculiarity has reappeared at\r\n    various times and places. Dr. Struthers has lately described and\r\n    figured[24] the structure of the feet; in both front and hind feet\r\n    the distal phalanges of the two greater toes are represented by a\r\n    single, great, hoof-bearing phalanx; and in the front feet, the\r\n    middle phalanges are represented by a bone which is single towards\r\n    the lower end, but bears two separate articulations towards the\r\n    upper end. From other accounts it appears that an intermediate toe\r\n    is likewise sometimes superadded.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Old Irish Pig, with jaw-appendages.\r\n\r\n    Another curious anomaly is offered by the appendages, described by\r\n    M. Eudes-Deslongchamps as often characterizing the Normandy pigs.\r\n    These appendages are always attached to the same spot, to the\r\n    corners of the jaw; they are cylindrical, about three inches in\r\n    length, covered with bristles, and with a pencil of bristles rising\r\n    out of a sinus on one side: they have a cartilaginous centre, with\r\n    two small longitudinal muscles they occur either symmetrically on\r\n    both sides of the face or on one side alone. Richardson figures\r\n    them on the gaunt old “Irish Greyhound pig;” and Nathusius states\r\n    that they occasionally appear in all the long eared races, but are\r\n    not strictly inherited, for they occur or fail in animals of the\r\n    same litter.[25] As no wild pigs are known to have analogous\r\n    appendages, we have at present no reason to suppose that their\r\n    appearance is due to reversion; and if this be so, we are forced to\r\n    admit that a somewhat complex, though apparently useless, structure\r\n    may be suddenly developed without the aid of selection.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the boars of all domesticated breeds have\r\nmuch shorter tusks than wild boars. Many facts show that with many\r\nanimals the state of the hair is much affected by exposure to, or\r\nprotection from, climate; and as we see that the state of the hair and\r\nteeth are correlated in Turkish dogs (other analogous facts will be\r\nhereafter given), may we not venture to surmise that the reduction of\r\nthe tusks in the domestic boar is related to his coat of bristles being\r\ndiminished from living under shelter? On the other hand, as we shall\r\nimmediately see, the tusks and bristles reappear with feral boars,\r\nwhich are no longer protected from the weather. It is not surprising\r\nthat the tusks should be more affected than the other teeth; as parts\r\ndeveloped to serve as secondary sexual characters are always liable to\r\nmuch variation.\r\n\r\n    It is a well-known fact that the young of wild European and Indian\r\n    pigs,[26] for the first six months, are longitudinally banded with\r\n    light-coloured stripes. This character generally disappears under\r\n    domestication. The Turkish domestic pigs, however, have striped\r\n    young, as have those of Westphalia, “whatever may be their\r\n    hue;”[27] whether these latter pigs belong to the same curly-haired\r\n    race as the Turkish swine, I do not know. The pigs which have run\r\n    wild in Jamaica and the semi-feral pigs of New Granada, both those\r\n    which are black and those which are black with a white band across\r\n    the stomach, often extending over the back, have resumed this\r\n    aboriginal character and produce longitudinally-striped young. This\r\n    is likewise the case, at least occasionally, with the neglected\r\n    pigs in the Zambesi settlement on the coast of Africa.[28]\r\n\r\n    The common belief that all domesticated animals, when they run\r\n    wild, revert completely to the character of their parent-stock, is\r\n    chiefly founded, as far as I can discover, on feral pigs. But even\r\n    in this case the belief is not grounded on sufficient evidence; for\r\n    the two main types, namely, _S. scrofa_ and _indicus,_ have not\r\n    been distinguished. The young, as we have just seen, reacquire\r\n    their longitudinal stripes, and the boars invariably reassume their\r\n    tusks. They revert also in the general shape of their bodies, and\r\n    in the length of their legs and muzzles, to the state of the wild\r\n    animal, as might have been expected from the amount of exercise\r\n    which they are compelled to take in search of food. In Jamaica the\r\n    feral pigs do not acquire the full size of the European wild boar,\r\n    “never attaining a greater height than 20 inches at the shoulder.”\r\n    In various countries they reassume their original bristly covering,\r\n    but in different degrees, dependent on the climate; thus, according\r\n    to Roulin, the semi-feral pigs in the hot valleys of New Granada\r\n    are very scantily clothed; whereas, on the Paramos, at the height\r\n    of 7000 to 8000 feet, they acquire a thick covering of wool lying\r\n    under the bristles, like that on the truly wild pigs of France.\r\n    These pigs on the Paramos are small and stunted. The wild boar of\r\n    India is said to have the bristles at the end of its tail arranged\r\n    like the plumes of an arrow, whilst the European boar has a simple\r\n    tuft; and it is a curious fact that many, but not all, of the feral\r\n    pigs in Jamaica, derived from a Spanish stock, have a plumed\r\n    tail.[29] With respect to colour, feral pigs generally revert to\r\n    that of the wild boar; but in certain parts of S. America, as we\r\n    have seen, some of the semi-feral pigs have a curious white band\r\n    across their stomachs; and in certain other hot places the pigs are\r\n    red, and this colour has likewise occasionally been observed in the\r\n    feral pigs of Jamaica. From these several facts we see that with\r\n    pigs when feral there is a strong tendency to revert to the wild\r\n    type; but that this tendency is largely governed by the nature of\r\n    the climate, amount of exercise, and other causes of change to\r\n    which they have been subjected.\r\n\r\n    The last point worth notice is that we have unusually good evidence\r\n    of breeds of pigs now keeping perfectly true, which have been\r\n    formed by the crossing of several distinct breeds. The Improved\r\n    Essex pigs, for instance, breed very true; but there is no doubt\r\n    that they largely owe their present excellent qualities to crosses\r\n    originally made by Lord Western with the Neapolitan race, and to\r\n    subsequent crosses with the Berkshire breed (this also having been\r\n    improved by Neapolitan crosses), and likewise, probably, with the\r\n    Sussex breed.[30] In breeds thus formed by complex crosses, the\r\n    most careful and unremitting selection during many generations has\r\n    been found to be indispensable. Chiefly in consequence of so much\r\n    crossing, some well-known breeds have undergone rapid changes;\r\n    thus, according to Nathusius,[31] the Berkshire breed of 1780 is\r\n    quite different from that of 1810; and, since this latter period,\r\n    at least two distinct forms have borne the same name.\r\n\r\nCATTLE.\r\n\r\n    Domestic cattle are certainly the descendants of more than one wild\r\n    form, in the same manner as has been shown to be the case with our\r\n    dogs and pigs. Naturalists have generally made two main divisions\r\n    of cattle: the humped kinds inhabiting tropical countries, called\r\n    in India Zebus, to which the specific name of _ Bos indicus_ has\r\n    been given; and the common non-humped cattle, generally included\r\n    under the name of _Bos taurus._ The humped cattle were\r\n    domesticated, as may be seen on the Egyptian monuments, at least as\r\n    early as the twelfth dynasty, that is 2100 B.C. They differ from\r\n    common cattle in various osteological characters, even in a greater\r\n    degree, according to Rütimeyer,[32] than do the fossil and\r\n    prehistoric European species, namely, _Bos primigenius_ and _\r\n    longifrons,_ from each other. They differ, also, as Mr. Blyth,[33]\r\n    who has particularly attended to this subject, remarks, in general\r\n    configuration, in the shape of their ears, in the point where the\r\n    dewlap commences, in the typical curvature of their horns, in their\r\n    manner of carrying their heads when at rest, in their ordinary\r\n    variations of colour, especially in the frequent presence of\r\n    “nilgau-like markings on their feet,” and “in the one being born\r\n    with teeth protruding through the jaws, and the other not so.” They\r\n    have different habits, and their voice is entirely different. The\r\n    humped cattle in India “seldom seek shade, and never go into the\r\n    water and there stand knee-deep, like the cattle of Europe.” They\r\n    have run wild in parts of Oude and Rohilcund, and can maintain\r\n    themselves in a region infested by tigers. They have given rise to\r\n    many races differing greatly in size, in the presence of one or two\r\n    humps, in length of horns, and other respects. Mr. Blyth sums up\r\n    emphatically that the humped and humpless cattle must be considered\r\n    as distinct species. When we consider the number of points in\r\n    external structure and habits, independently of important\r\n    osteological differences, in which they differ from each other; and\r\n    that many of these points are not likely to have been affected by\r\n    domestication, there can hardly be a doubt, notwithstanding the\r\n    adverse opinion of some naturalists, that the humped and non-humped\r\n    cattle must be ranked as specifically distinct.\r\n\r\n    The European breeds of humpless cattle are numerous. Professor Low\r\n    enumerates 19 British breeds, only a few of which are identical\r\n    with those on the Continent. Even the small Channel islands of\r\n    Guernsey, Jersey, and Alderney possess their own sub-breeds;[34]\r\n    and these again differ from the cattle of the other British\r\n    islands, such as Anglesea, and the western isles of Scotland.\r\n    Desmarest, who paid attention to the subject, describes 15 French\r\n    races, excluding sub-varieties and those imported from other\r\n    countries. In other parts of Europe there are several distinct\r\n    races, such as the pale-coloured Hungarian cattle, with their light\r\n    and free step, and enormous horns sometimes measuring above five\r\n    feet from tip to tip:[35] the Podolian cattle also are remarkable\r\n    from the height of their fore-quarters. In the most recent work on\r\n    Cattle,[36] engravings are given of fifty-five European breeds; it\r\n    is, however, probable that several of these differ very little from\r\n    each other, or are merely synonyms. It must not be supposed that\r\n    numerous breeds of cattle exist only in long-civilised countries,\r\n    for we shall presently see that several kinds are kept by the\r\n    savages of Southern Africa.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the parentage of the several European breeds, we\r\n    already know much from Nilsson’s Memoir,[37] and more especially\r\n    from Rütimeyer’s works and those of Boyd Dawkins. Two or three\r\n    species or forms of Bos, closely allied to still living domestic\r\n    races, have been found in the more recent tertiary deposits or\r\n    amongst prehistoric remains in Europe. Following Rütimeyer, we\r\n    have:—\r\n\r\n    _Bos primigenius._This magnificent, well known species was\r\n    domesticated in Switzerland during the Neolithic period; even at\r\n    this early period it varied a little, having apparently been\r\n    crossed with other races. Some of the larger races on the\r\n    Continent, as the Friesland, etc., and the Pembroke race in\r\n    England, closely resemble in essential structure _B. primigenius,_\r\n    and no doubt are its descendants. This is likewise the opinion of\r\n    Nilsson. _Bos primigenius_ existed as a wild animal in Cæsar’s\r\n    time, and is now semi-wild, though much degenerated in size, in the\r\n    park of Chillingham; for I am informed by Professor Rütimeyer, to\r\n    whom Lord Tankerville sent a skull, that the Chillingham cattle are\r\n    less altered from the true primigenius type than any other known\r\n    breed.[38]\r\n\r\n    _Bos trochoceros._ This form is not included in the three species\r\n    above mentioned, for it is now considered by Rütimeyer to be the\r\n    female of an early domesticated form of _B. primigenius,_ and as\r\n    the progenitor of his _frontosus_ race. I may add that specific\r\n    names have been given to four other fossil oxen, now believed to be\r\n    identical with _B. primigenius._[39]\r\n\r\n    _Bos longifrons_ (or _ brachyceros_) of Owen.—This very distinct\r\n    species was of small size, and had a short body with fine legs.\r\n    According to Boyd Dawkins[40] it was introduced as a domesticated\r\n    animal into Britain at a very early period, and supplied food to\r\n    the Roman legionaries.[41] Some remains have been found in Ireland\r\n    in certain crannoges, of which the dates are believed to be from\r\n    843-933 A.D.[42] It was also the commonest form in a domesticated\r\n    condition in Switzerland during the earliest part of the Neolithic\r\n    period. Professor Owen[43] thinks it probable that the Welsh and\r\n    Highland cattle are descended from this form; as likewise is the\r\n    case, according to Rütimeyer, with some of the existing Swiss\r\n    breeds. These latter are of different shades of colour from\r\n    light-grey to blackish-brown, with a lighter stripe along the\r\n    spine, but they have no pure white marks. The cattle of North Wales\r\n    and the Highlands, on the other hand, are generally black or\r\n    dark-coloured.\r\n\r\n    _Bos frontosus_ of Nilsson.—This species is allied to _B.\r\n    longifrons,_ and, according to the high authority of Mr. Boyd\r\n    Dawkins, is identical with it, but in the opinion of some judges is\r\n    distinct. Both co-existed in Scania during the same late geological\r\n    period,[44] and both have been found in the Irish crannoges.[45]\r\n    Nilsson believes that his _B. frontosus_ may be the parent of the\r\n    mountain cattle of Norway, which have a high protuberance on the\r\n    skull between the base of the horns. As Professor Owen and others\r\n    believe that the Scotch Highland cattle are descended from his _B.\r\n    longifrons,_ it is worth notice that a capable judge[46] has\r\n    remarked that he saw no cattle in Norway like the Highland breed,\r\n    but that they more nearly resembled the Devonshire breed.\r\n\r\n    On the whole we may conclude, more especially from the researches\r\n    of Boyd Dawkins, that European cattle are descended from two\r\n    species; and there is no improbability in this fact, for the genus\r\n    Bos readily yields to domestication. Besides these two species and\r\n    the zebu, the yak, the gayal, and the arni[47] (not to mention the\r\n    buffalo or genus Bubalus) have been domesticated; making altogether\r\n    six species of Bos. The zebu and the two European species are now\r\n    extinct in a wild state. Although certain races of cattle were\r\n    domesticated at a very ancient period in Europe, it does not follow\r\n    that they were first domesticated here. Those who place much\r\n    reliance on philology argue that they were imported from the\r\n    East.[48] It is probable that they originally inhabited a temperate\r\n    or cold climate, but not a land long covered with snow; for our\r\n    cattle, as we have seen in the chapter on Horses, have not the\r\n    instinct of scraping away the snow to get at the herbage beneath.\r\n    No one could behold the magnificent wild bulls on the bleak\r\n    Falkland Islands in the southern hemisphere, and doubt about the\r\n    climate being admirably suited to them. Azara has remarked that in\r\n    the temperate regions of La Plata the cows conceive when two years\r\n    old, whilst in the much hotter country of Paraguay they do not\r\n    conceive till three years old; “from which fact,” as he adds, “one\r\n    may conclude that cattle do not succeed so well in warm\r\n    countries.”[49]\r\n\r\n    _Bos primigenius_ and _longifrons_ have been ranked by nearly all\r\n    palæontologists as distinct species; and it would not be reasonable\r\n    to take a different view simply because their domesticated\r\n    descendants now intercross with the utmost freedom. All the\r\n    European breeds have so often been crossed both intentionally and\r\n    unintentionally, that, if any sterility had ensued from such\r\n    unions, it would certainly have been detected. As zebus inhabit a\r\n    distant and much hotter region, and as they differ in so many\r\n    characters from our European cattle, I have taken pains to\r\n    ascertain whether the two forms are fertile when crossed. The late\r\n    Lord Powis imported some zebus and crossed them with common cattle\r\n    in Shropshire; and I was assured by his steward that the cross-bred\r\n    animals were perfectly fertile with both parent-stocks. Mr. Blyth\r\n    informs me that in India hybrids, with various proportions of\r\n    either blood, are quite fertile; and this can hardly fail to be\r\n    known, for in some districts[50] the two species are allowed to\r\n    breed freely together. Most of the cattle which were first\r\n    introduced into Tasmania were humped, so that at one time thousands\r\n    of crossed animals existed there; and Mr. B. O’Neile Wilson, M.A.,\r\n    writes to me from Tasmania that he has never heard of any sterility\r\n    having been observed. He himself formerly possessed a herd of such\r\n    crossed cattle, and all were perfectly fertile; so much so, that he\r\n    cannot remember even a single cow failing to calve. These several\r\n    facts afford an important confirmation of the Pallasian doctrine\r\n    that the descendants of species which when first domesticated would\r\n    if crossed have been in all probability in some degree sterile,\r\n    become perfectly fertile after a long course of domestication. In a\r\n    future chapter we shall see that this doctrine throws some light on\r\n    the difficult subject of Hybridism.\r\n\r\n    I have alluded to the cattle in Chillingham Park, which, according\r\n    to Rütimeyer, have been very little changed from the _Bos\r\n    primigenius_ type. This park is so ancient that it is referred to\r\n    in a record of the year 1220. The cattle in their instincts and\r\n    habits are truly wild. They are white, with the inside of the ears\r\n    reddish-brown, eyes rimmed with black, muzzles brown, hoofs black,\r\n    and horns white tipped with black. Within a period of thirty-three\r\n    years about a dozen calves were born with “brown and blue spots\r\n    upon the cheeks or necks; but these, together with any defective\r\n    animals, were always destroyed.” According to Bewick, about the\r\n    year 1770 some calves appeared with black ears; but these were also\r\n    destroyed by the keeper, and black ears have not since reappeared.\r\n    The wild white cattle in the Duke of Hamilton’s park, where I have\r\n    heard of the birth of a black calf, are said by Lord Tankerville to\r\n    be inferior to those at Chillingham. The cattle kept until the year\r\n    1780 by the Duke of Queensberry, but now extinct, had their ears,\r\n    muzzle, and orbits of the eyes black. Those which have existed from\r\n    time immemorial at Chartley, closely resemble the cattle at\r\n    Chillingham, but are larger, “with some small difference in the\r\n    colour of the ears.” “They frequently tend to become entirely\r\n    black; and a singular superstition prevails in the vicinity that,\r\n    when a black calf is born, some calamity impends over the noble\r\n    house of Ferrers. All the black calves are destroyed.” The cattle\r\n    at Burton Constable in Yorkshire, now extinct, had ears, muzzle,\r\n    and the tip of the tail black. Those at Gisburne, also in\r\n    Yorkshire, are said by Bewick to have been sometimes without dark\r\n    muzzles, with the inside alone of the ears brown; and they are\r\n    elsewhere said to have been low in stature and hornless.[51]\r\n\r\nThe several above-specified differences in the park-cattle, slight\r\nthough they be, are worth recording, as they show that animals living\r\nnearly in a state of nature, and exposed to nearly uniform conditions,\r\nif not allowed to roam freely and to cross with other herds, do not\r\nkeep as uniform as truly wild animals. For the preservation of a\r\nuniform character, even within the same park, a certain degree of\r\nselection—that is, the destruction of the dark-coloured calves—is\r\napparently necessary.\r\n\r\n    Boyd Dawkins believes that the park-cattle are descended from\r\n    anciently domesticated, and not truly wild animals; and from the\r\n    occasional appearance of dark-coloured calves, it is improbable\r\n    that the aboriginal _Bos primigenius_ was white. It is curious what\r\n    a strong, though not invariable, tendency there is in wild or\r\n    escaped cattle to become white with coloured ears, under widely\r\n    different conditions of life. If the old writers Boethius and\r\n    Leslie[52] can be trusted, the wild cattle of Scotland were white\r\n    and furnished with a great mane; but the colour of their ears is\r\n    not mentioned. In Wales,[53] during the tenth century, some of the\r\n    cattle are described as being white with red ears. Four hundred\r\n    cattle thus coloured were sent to King John; and an early record\r\n    speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having been demanded as a\r\n    compensation for some offence, but, if the cattle were of a dark or\r\n    black colour, 150 were to be presented. The black cattle of North\r\n    Wales apparently belong, as we have seen, to the small _\r\n    longifrons_ type: and as the alternative was offered of either 150\r\n    dark cattle, or 100 white cattle with red ears, we may presume that\r\n    the latter were the larger beasts, and probably belonged to the\r\n    _primigenius_ type. Youatt has remarked that at the present day,\r\n    whenever cattle of the shorthorn breed are white, the extremities\r\n    of their ears are more or less tinged with red.\r\n\r\n    The cattle which have run wild on the Pampas, in Texas, and in two\r\n    parts of Africa, have become of a nearly uniform dark\r\n    brownish-red.[54] On the Ladrone Islands, in the Pacific Ocean,\r\n    immense herds of cattle, which were wild in the year 1741, are\r\n    described as “milk-white, except their ears, which are generally\r\n    black.”[55] The Falkland Islands, situated far south, with all the\r\n    conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive from\r\n    those of the Ladrones, offer a more interesting case. Cattle have\r\n    run wild there during eighty or ninety years; and in the southern\r\n    districts the animals are mostly white, with their feet, or whole\r\n    heads, or only their ears black; but my informant, Admiral\r\n    Sulivan,[56] who long resided on these islands, does not believe\r\n    that they are ever purely white. So that in these two archipelagos\r\n    we see that the cattle tend to become white with coloured ears. In\r\n    other parts of the Falkland Islands other colours prevail: near\r\n    Port Pleasant brown is the common tint; round Mount Usborn, about\r\n    half the animals in some of the herds were lead- or mouse-coloured,\r\n    which elsewhere is an unusual tint. These latter cattle, though\r\n    generally inhabiting high land, breed about a month earlier than\r\n    the other cattle; and this circumstance would aid in keeping them\r\n    distinct and in perpetuating a peculiar colour. It is worth\r\n    recalling to mind that blue or lead-coloured marks have\r\n    occasionally appeared on the white cattle of Chillingham. So\r\n    plainly different were the colours of the wild herds in different\r\n    parts of the Falkland Islands, that in hunting them, as Admiral\r\n    Sulivan informs me, white spots in one district, and dark spots in\r\n    another district, were always looked out for on the distant hills.\r\n    In the intermediate districts, intermediate colours prevailed.\r\n    Whatever the cause may be, this tendency in the wild cattle of the\r\n    Falkland Islands, which are all descended from a few brought from\r\n    La Plata, to break up into herds of three different colours, is an\r\n    interesting fact.\r\n\r\nReturning to the several British breeds, the conspicuous difference in\r\ngeneral appearance between Shorthorns, Longhorns (now rarely seen),\r\nHerefords, Highland cattle, Alderneys, etc., must be familiar to every\r\none. A part of this difference may be attributed to descent from\r\nprimordially distinct species; but we may feel sure that there has been\r\na considerable amount of variation. Even during the Neolithic period,\r\nthe domestic cattle were to a certain extent variable. Within recent\r\ntimes most of the breeds have been modified by careful and methodical\r\nselection. How strongly the characters thus acquired are inherited, may\r\nbe inferred from the prices realised by the improved breeds; even at\r\nthe first sale of Colling’s Shorthorns, eleven bulls reached an average\r\nof 214 pounds, and lately Shorthorn bulls have been sold for a thousand\r\nguineas, and have been exported to all quarters of the world.\r\n\r\n    Some constitutional differences may be here noticed. The Shorthorns\r\n    arrive at maturity far earlier than the wilder breeds, such as\r\n    those of Wales or the Highlands. This fact has been shown in an\r\n    interesting manner by Mr. Simonds,[57] who has given a table of the\r\n    average period of their dentition, which proves that there is a\r\n    difference of no less than six months in the appearance of the\r\n    permanent incisors. The period of gestation, from observations made\r\n    by Tessier on 1131 cows, varies to the extent of eighty-one days;\r\n    and what is more interesting, M. Lefour affirms “that the period of\r\n    gestation is longer in the large German cattle than in the smaller\r\n    breeds.”[58] With respect to the period of conception, it seems\r\n    certain that Alderney and Zetland cows often become pregnant\r\n    earlier than other breeds.[59] Lastly, as four fully developed\r\n    mammæ is a generic character in the genus Bos,[60] it is worth\r\n    notice that with our domestic cows the two rudimentary mammæ often\r\n    become fairly well developed and yield milk.\r\n\r\n    As numerous breeds are generally found only in long-civilised\r\n    countries, it may be well to show that in some countries inhabited\r\n    by barbarous races, who are frequently at war with each other, and\r\n    therefore have little free communication, several distinct breeds\r\n    of cattle now exist or formerly existed. At the Cape of Good Hope\r\n    Leguat observed, in the year 1720, three kinds.[61] At the present\r\n    day various travellers have noticed the differences in the breeds\r\n    in Southern Africa. Sir Andrew Smith several years ago remarked to\r\n    me that the cattle possessed by the different tribes of Caffres,\r\n    though living near each other under the same latitude and in the\r\n    same kind of country, yet differed, and he expressed much surprise\r\n    at the fact. Mr. Andersson has described[62] the Damara, Bechuana,\r\n    and Namaqua cattle; and he informs me in a letter that the cattle\r\n    north of Lake Ngami are likewise different, as Mr. Galton has heard\r\n    is also the case with the cattle of Benguela. The Namaqua cattle in\r\n    size and shape nearly resemble European cattle, and have short\r\n    stout horns and large hoofs. The Damara cattle are very peculiar,\r\n    being big-boned, with slender legs, and small hard feet; their\r\n    tails are adorned with a tuft of long bushy hair nearly touching\r\n    the ground, and their horns are extraordinarily large. The Bechuana\r\n    cattle have even larger horns, and there is now a skull in London\r\n    with the two horns 8 ft. 8-1/4 in. long, as measured in a straight\r\n    line from tip to tip, and no less than 13 ft. 5 in. as measured\r\n    along their curvature! Mr. Andersson in his letter to me says that,\r\n    though he will not venture to describe the differences between the\r\n    breeds belonging to the many different sub-tribes, yet such\r\n    certainly exist, as shown by the wonderful facility with which the\r\n    natives discriminate them.\r\n\r\n    That many breeds of cattle have originated through variation,\r\n    independently of descent from distinct species, we may infer from\r\n    what we see in South America, where the genus Bos was not endemic,\r\n    and where the cattle which now exist in such vast numbers are the\r\n    descendants of a few imported from Spain and Portugal. In Columbia,\r\n    Roulin[63] describes two peculiar breeds, namely, _pelones,_ with\r\n    extremely thin and fine hair, and _calongos,_ absolutely naked.\r\n    According to Castelnau there are two races in Brazil, one like\r\n    European cattle, the other different, with remarkable horns. In\r\n    Paraguay, Azara describes a breed which certainly originated in S.\r\n    America, called _chivos,_ “because they have straight vertical\r\n    horns, conical, and very large at the base.” He likewise describes\r\n    a dwarf race in Corrientes, with short legs and a body larger than\r\n    usual. Cattle without horns, and others with reversed hair, have\r\n    also originated in Paraguay.\r\n\r\n    Another monstrous breed, called niatas or natas, of which I saw two\r\n    small herds on the northern bank of the Plata, is so remarkable as\r\n    to deserve a fuller description. This breed bears the same relation\r\n    to other breeds, as bull or pug dogs do to other dogs, or as\r\n    improved pigs, according to H. von Nathusius, do to common\r\n    pigs.[64] Rütimeyer believes that these cattle belong to the\r\n    primigenius type.[65] The forehead is very short and broad, with\r\n    the nasal end of the skull, together with the whole plane of the\r\n    upper molar-teeth, curved upwards. The lower jaw projects beyond\r\n    the upper, and has a corresponding upward curvature. It is an\r\n    interesting fact that an almost similar confirmation characterizes,\r\n    as I am informed by Dr. Falconer, the extinct and gigantic\r\n    Sivatherium of India, and is not known in any other ruminant. The\r\n    upper lip is much drawn back, the nostrils are seated high up and\r\n    are widely open, the eyes project outwards, and the horns are\r\n    large. In walking the head is carried low, and the neck is short.\r\n    The hind legs appear to be longer, compared with the front legs,\r\n    than is usual. The exposed incisor teeth, the short head and\r\n    upturned nostrils, give these cattle the most ludicrous,\r\n    self-confident air of defiance. The skull which I presented to the\r\n    College of Surgeons has been thus described by Professor Owen:[66]\r\n    “It is remarkable from the stunted development of the nasals,\r\n    premaxillaries, and fore-part of the lower jaw, which is unusually\r\n    curved upwards to come into contact with the premaxillaries. The\r\n    nasal bones are about one-third the ordinary length, but retain\r\n    almost their normal breadth. The triangular vacuity is left between\r\n    them, the frontal and lachrymal, which latter bone articulates with\r\n    the premaxillary, and thus excludes the maxillary from any junction\r\n    with the nasal.” So that even the connexion of some of the bones is\r\n    changed. Other differences might be added: thus the plane of the\r\n    condyles is somewhat modified, and the terminal edge of the\r\n    premaxillaries forms an arch. In fact, on comparison with the skull\r\n    of a common ox, scarcely a single bone presents the same exact\r\n    shape, and the whole skull has a wonderfully different appearance.\r\n\r\nThe first brief published notice of this race was by Azara, between the\r\nyears 1783-96; but Don F. Muniz, of Luxan, who has kindly collected\r\ninformation for me, states that about 1760 these cattle were kept as\r\ncuriosities near Buenos Ayres. Their origin is not positively known,\r\nbut they must have originated subsequently to the year 1552, when\r\ncattle were first introduced. Senor Muniz informs me that the breed is\r\nbelieved to have originated with the Indians southward of the Plata.\r\nEven to this day those reared near the Plata show their less civilised\r\nnature in being fiercer than common cattle, and in the cow, if visited\r\ntoo often, easily deserting her first calf. The breed is very true, and\r\na niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves. The breed has\r\nalready lasted at least a century. A niata bull crossed with a common\r\ncow, and the reverse cross, yield offspring having an intermediate\r\ncharacter, but with the niata character strongly displayed. According\r\nto Senor Muniz, there is the clearest evidence, contrary to the common\r\nbelief of agriculturists in analogous cases, that the niata cow when\r\ncrossed with a common bull transmits her peculiarities more strongly\r\nthan does the niata bull when crossed with a common cow. When the\r\npasture is tolerably long, these cattle feed as well as common cattle\r\nwith their tongue and palate; but during the great droughts, when so\r\nmany animals perish on the Pampas, the niata breed lies under a great\r\ndisadvantage, and would, if not attended to, become extinct; for the\r\ncommon cattle, like horses, are able to keep alive by browsing with\r\ntheir lips on the twigs of trees and on reeds: this the niatas cannot\r\nso well do, as their lips do not join, and hence they are found to\r\nperish before the common cattle. This strikes me as a good illustration\r\nof how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of an\r\nanimal, on what circumstances, occurring only at long intervals of\r\ntime, its rarity or extinction may depend. It shows us, also, how\r\nnatural selection would have determined the rejection of the niata\r\nmodification had it arisen in a state of nature.\r\n\r\n    Having described the semi-monstrous niata breed, I may allude to a\r\n    white bull, said to have been brought from Africa, which was\r\n    exhibited in London in 1829, and which has been well figured by Mr.\r\n    Harvey.[67] It had a hump, and was furnished with a mane. The\r\n    dewlap was peculiar, being divided between its fore-legs into\r\n    parallel divisions. Its lateral hoofs were annually shed, and grew\r\n    to the length of five or six inches. The eye was very peculiar,\r\n    being remarkably prominent, and “resembled a cup and ball, thus\r\n    enabling the animal to see on all sides with equal ease; the pupil\r\n    was small and oval, or rather a parallelogram with the ends cut\r\n    off, and lying transversely across the ball.” A new and strange\r\n    breed might probably have been formed by careful breeding and\r\n    selection from this animal.\r\n\r\n    I have often speculated on the probable causes through which each\r\n    separate district in Great Britain came to possess in former times\r\n    its own peculiar breed of cattle; and the question is, perhaps,\r\n    even more perplexing in the case of Southern Africa. We now know\r\n    that the differences may be in part attributed to descent from\r\n    distinct species; but this cause is far from sufficient. Have the\r\n    slight differences in climate and in the nature of the pasture, in\r\n    the different districts of Britain, directly induced corresponding\r\n    differences in the cattle? We have seen that the semi-wild cattle\r\n    in the several British parks are not identical in colouring or\r\n    size, and that some degree of selection has been requisite to keep\r\n    them true. It is almost certain that abundant food given during\r\n    many generations directly affects the size of a breed.[68] That\r\n    climate directly affects the thickness of the skin and the hair is\r\n    likewise certain: thus Roulin asserts[69] that the hides of the\r\n    feral cattle on the hot Llanos “are always much less heavy than\r\n    those of the cattle raised on the high platform of Bogota; and that\r\n    these hides yield in weight and in thickness of hair to those of\r\n    the cattle which have run wild on the lofty Paramos.” The same\r\n    difference has been observed in the hides of the cattle reared on\r\n    the bleak Falkland Islands and on the temperate Pampas. Low has\r\n    remarked[70] that the cattle which inhabit the more humid parts of\r\n    Britain have longer hair and thicker skins than other British\r\n    cattle. When we compare highly improved stall-fed cattle with the\r\n    wilder breeds, or compare mountain and lowland breeds, we cannot\r\n    doubt that an active life, leading to the free use of the limbs and\r\n    lungs, affects the shape and proportions of the whole body. It is\r\n    probable that some breeds, such as the semi-monstrous niata cattle,\r\n    and some peculiarities, such as being hornless, etc., have appeared\r\n    suddenly owing to what we may call in our ignorance spontaneous\r\n    variation; but even in this case a rude kind of selection is\r\n    necessary, and the animals thus characterised must be at least\r\n    partially separated from others. This degree of care, however, has\r\n    sometimes been taken even in little-civilised districts, where we\r\n    should least have expected it, as in the case of the niata, chivo,\r\n    and hornless cattle in S. America.\r\n\r\n    That methodical selection has done wonders within a recent period\r\n    in modifying our cattle, no one doubts. During the process of\r\n    methodical selection it has occasionally happened that deviations\r\n    of structure, more strongly pronounced than mere individual\r\n    differences, yet by no means deserving to be called monstrosities,\r\n    have been taken advantage of: thus the famous Longhorn Bull,\r\n    Shakespeare, though of the pure Canley stock, scarcely inherited a\r\n    single point of the long-horned breed, his horns excepted;[71] yet\r\n    in the hands of Mr. Fowler, this bull greatly improved his race. We\r\n    have also reason to believe that selection, carried on so far\r\n    unconsciously that there was at no one time any distinct intention\r\n    to improve or change the breed, has in the course of time modified\r\n    most of our cattle; for by this process, aided by more abundant\r\n    food, all the lowland British breeds have increased greatly in size\r\n    and in early maturity since the reign of Henry VII.[72] It should\r\n    never be forgotten that many animals have to be annually\r\n    slaughtered; so that each owner must determine which shall be\r\n    killed and which preserved for breeding. In every district, as\r\n    Youatt has remarked, there is a prejudice in favour of the native\r\n    breed; so that animals possessing qualities, whatever they may be,\r\n    which are most valued in each district, will be oftenest preserved;\r\n    and this unmethodical selection assuredly will in the long run\r\n    affect the character of the whole breed. But it may be asked, can\r\n    this rude kind of selection have been practised by barbarians such\r\n    as those of southern Africa? In a future chapter on Selection we\r\n    shall see that this has certainly occurred to some extent.\r\n    Therefore, looking to the origin of the many breeds of cattle which\r\n    formerly inhabited the several districts of Britain, I conclude\r\n    that, although slight differences in the nature of the climate,\r\n    food, etc., as well as changed habits of life, aided by correlation\r\n    of growth, and the occasional appearance from unknown causes of\r\n    considerable deviations of structure, have all probably played\r\n    their parts; yet that the occasional preservation in each district\r\n    of those individual animals which were most valued by each owner\r\n    has perhaps been even more effective in the production of the\r\n    several British breeds. As soon as two or more breeds were formed\r\n    in any district, or when new breeds descended from distinct species\r\n    were introduced, their crossing, especially if aided by some\r\n    selection, will have multiplied the number and modified the\r\n    characters of the older breeds.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\n    I shall treat this subject briefly. Most authors look at our\r\n    domestic sheep as descended from several distinct species. Mr.\r\n    Blyth, who has carefully attended to the subject, believes that\r\n    fourteen wild species now exist, but “that not one of them can be\r\n    identified as the progenitor of any one of the interminable\r\n    domestic races.” M. Gervais thinks that there are six species of\r\n    Ovis,[73] but that our domestic sheep form a distinct genus, now\r\n    completely extinct. A German naturalist[74] believes that our sheep\r\n    descend from ten aboriginally distinct species, of which only one\r\n    is still living in a wild state! Another ingenious observer,[75]\r\n    though not a naturalist, with a bold defiance of everything known\r\n    on geographical distribution, infers that the sheep of Great\r\n    Britain alone are the descendants of eleven endemic British forms!\r\n    Under such a hopeless state of doubt it would be useless for my\r\n    purpose to give a detailed account of the several breeds; but a few\r\n    remarks may be added.\r\n\r\n    Sheep have been domesticated from a very ancient period.\r\n    Rütimeyer[76] found in the Swiss lake-dwellings the remains of a\r\n    small breed, with thin tall legs, and horns like those of a goat,\r\n    thus differing somewhat from any kind now known. Almost every\r\n    country has its own peculiar breed; and many countries have several\r\n    breeds differing greatly from each other. One of the most strongly\r\n    marked races is an Eastern one with a long tail, including,\r\n    according to Pallas, twenty vertebræ, and so loaded with fat that\r\n    it is sometimes placed on a truck, which is dragged about by the\r\n    living animal. These sheep, though ranked by Fitzinger as a\r\n    distinct aboriginal form, bear in their drooping ears the stamp of\r\n    long domestication. This is likewise the case with those sheep\r\n    which have two great masses of fat on the rump, with the tail in a\r\n    rudimentary condition. The Angola variety of the long-tailed race\r\n    has curious masses of fat on the back of the head and beneath the\r\n    jaws.[77] Mr. Hodgson in an admirable paper[78] on the sheep of the\r\n    Himalaya infers from the distribution of the several races, “that\r\n    this caudal augmentation in most of its phases is an instance of\r\n    degeneracy in these pre-eminently Alpine animals.” The horns\r\n    present an endless diversity in character; being not rarely absent,\r\n    especially in the female sex, or, on the other hand, amounting to\r\n    four or even eight in number. The horns, when numerous, arise from\r\n    a crest on the frontal bone, which is elevated in a peculiar\r\n    manner. It is remarkable that multiplicity of horns “is generally\r\n    accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece.”[79] This\r\n    correlation, however, is far from being general; for instance, I am\r\n    informed by Mr. D. Forbes, that the Spanish sheep in Chile\r\n    resemble, in fleece and in all other characters, their parent\r\n    merino-race, except that instead of a pair they generally bear four\r\n    horns. The existence of a pair of mammæ is a generic character in\r\n    the genus Ovis as well as in several allied forms; nevertheless, as\r\n    Mr. Hodgson has remarked, “this character is not absolutely\r\n    constant even among the true and proper sheep: for I have more than\r\n    once met with Càgias (a sub-Himalayan domestic race) possessed of\r\n    four teats.”[80] This case is the more remarkable as, when any part\r\n    or organ is present in reduced number in comparison with the same\r\n    part in allied groups, it usually is subject to little variation.\r\n    The presence of interdigital pits has likewise been considered as a\r\n    generic distinction in sheep; but Isidore Geoffroy[81] has shown\r\n    that these pits or pouches are absent in some breeds.\r\n\r\n    In sheep there is a strong tendency for characters, which have\r\n    apparently been acquired under domestication, to become attached\r\n    either exclusively to the male sex, or to be more highly developed\r\n    in this than in the other sex. Thus in many breeds the horns are\r\n    deficient in the ewe, though this likewise occurs occasionally with\r\n    the female of the wild musmon. In the rams of the Wallachian breed,\r\n    “the horns spring almost perpendicularly from the frontal bone, and\r\n    then take a beautiful spiral form; in the ewes they protrude nearly\r\n    at right angles from the head, and then become twisted in a\r\n    singular manner.”[82] Mr. Hodgson states that the extraordinarily\r\n    arched nose or chaffron, which is so highly developed in several\r\n    foreign breeds, is characteristic of the ram alone, and apparently\r\n    is the result of domestication.[83] I hear from Mr. Blyth that the\r\n    accumulation of fat in the fat-tailed sheep of the plains of India\r\n    is greater in the male than in the female; and Fitzinger[84]\r\n    remarks that the mane in the African maned race is far more\r\n    developed in the ram than in the ewe.\r\n\r\n    Different races of sheep, like cattle, present constitutional\r\n    differences. Thus the improved breeds arrive at maturity at an\r\n    early age, as has been well shown by Mr. Simonds through their\r\n    early average period of dentition. The several races have become\r\n    adapted to different kinds of pasture and climate: for instance, no\r\n    one can rear Leicester sheep on mountainous regions, where Cheviots\r\n    flourish. As Youatt has remarked, “In all the different districts\r\n    of Great Britain we find various breeds of sheep beautifully\r\n    adapted to the locality which they occupy. No one knows their\r\n    origin; they are indigenous to the soil, climate, pasturage, and\r\n    the locality on which they graze; they seem to have been formed for\r\n    it and by it.”[85] Marshall relates[86] that a flock of heavy\r\n    Lincolnshire and light Norfolk sheep which had been bred together\r\n    in a large sheep-walk, part of which was low, rich, and moist, and\r\n    another part high and dry, with benty grass, when turned out,\r\n    regularly separated from each other; the heavy sheep drawing off to\r\n    the rich soil, and the lighter sheep to their own soil; so that\r\n    “whilst there was plenty of grass the two breeds kept themselves as\r\n    distinct as rooks and pigeons.” Numerous sheep from various parts\r\n    of the world have been brought during a long course of years to the\r\n    Zoological Gardens of London; but as Youatt, who attended the\r\n    animals as a veterinary surgeon, remarks, “few or none die of the\r\n    rot, but they are phthisical; not one of them from a torrid climate\r\n    lasts out the second year, and when they die their lungs are\r\n    tuberculated.”[87] There is very good evidence that English breeds\r\n    of sheep will not succeed in France.[88] Even in certain parts of\r\n    England it has been found impossible to keep certain breeds of\r\n    sheep; thus on a farm on the banks of the Ouse, the Leicester sheep\r\n    were so rapidly destroyed by pleuritis[89] that the owner could not\r\n    keep them; the coarser-skinned sheep never being affected.\r\n\r\n    The period of gestation was formerly thought to be of so\r\n    unalterable a character, that a supposed difference of this kind\r\n    between the wolf and the dog was esteemed a sure sign of specific\r\n    distinction; but we have seen that the period is shorter in the\r\n    improved breeds of the pig, and in the larger breeds of the ox,\r\n    than in other breeds of these two animals. And now we know, on the\r\n    excellent authority of Hermann von Nathusius,[90] that Merino and\r\n    Southdown sheep, when both have long been kept under exactly the\r\n    same conditions, differ in their average period of gestation, as is\r\n    seen in the following Table:—\r\n\r\nMerinos     150·3 days. Southdowns     144·2 days. Half-bred Merinos and\r\nSouthdowns     146·3 days. 3/4 blood of Southdown     145·5 days. 7/8\r\nblood of Southdown     144·2 days.\r\n\r\nIn this graduated difference in cross-bred animals having different\r\nproportions of Southdown blood, we see how strictly the two periods of\r\ngestation have been transmitted. Nathusius remarks that, as Southdowns\r\ngrow with remarkable rapidity after birth, it is not surprising that\r\ntheir foetal development should have been shortened. It is of course\r\npossible that the difference in these two breeds may be due to their\r\ndescent from distinct parent-species; but as the early maturity of the\r\nSouthdowns has long been carefully attended to by breeders, the\r\ndifference is more probably the result of such attention. Lastly, the\r\nfecundity of the several breeds differs much; some generally producing\r\ntwins or even triplets at a birth, of which fact the curious Shangai\r\nsheep (with their truncated and rudimentary ears, and great Roman\r\nnoses), lately exhibited in the Zoological Gardens, offer a remarkable\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n    Sheep are perhaps more readily affected by the direct action of the\r\n    conditions of life to which they have been exposed than almost any\r\n    other domestic animal. According to Pallas, and more recently\r\n    according to Erman, the fat-tailed Kirghisian sheep, when bred for\r\n    a few generations in Russia, degenerate, and the mass of fat\r\n    dwindles away, “the scanty and bitter herbage of the steppes seems\r\n    so essential to their development.” Pallas makes an analogous\r\n    statement with respect to one of the Crimean breeds. Burnes states\r\n    that the Karakool breed, which produces a fine, curled, black, and\r\n    valuable fleece, when removed from its own canton near Bokhara to\r\n    Persia or to other quarters, loses its peculiar fleece.[91] In all\r\n    such cases, however, it may be that a change of any kind in the\r\n    conditions of life causes variability and consequent loss of\r\n    character, and not that certain conditions are necessary for the\r\n    development of certain characters.\r\n\r\n    Great heat, however, seems to act directly on the fleece: several\r\n    accounts have been published of the change which sheep imported\r\n    from Europe undergo in the West Indies. Dr. Nicholson of Antigua\r\n    informs me that, after the third generation, the wool disappears\r\n    from the whole body, except over the loins; and the animal then\r\n    appears like a goat with a dirty door-mat on its back. A similar\r\n    change is said to take place on the west coast of Africa.[92] On\r\n    the other hand, many wool-bearing sheep live on the hot plains of\r\n    India. Roulin asserts that in the lower and heated valleys of the\r\n    Cordillera, if the lambs are sheared as soon as the wool has grown\r\n    to a certain thickness, all goes on afterwards as usual; but if not\r\n    sheared, the wool detaches itself in flakes, and short shining hair\r\n    like that on a goat is produced ever afterwards. This curious\r\n    result seems merely to be an exaggerated tendency natural to the\r\n    Merino breed, for as a great authority, namely, Lord Somerville,\r\n    remarks, “the wool of our Merino sheep after shear-time is hard and\r\n    coarse to such a degree as to render it almost impossible to\r\n    suppose that the same animal could bear wool so opposite in\r\n    quality, compared to that which has been clipped from it: as the\r\n    cold weather advances, the fleeces recover their soft quality.” As\r\n    in sheep of all breeds the fleece naturally consists of longer and\r\n    coarser hair covering shorter and softer wool, the change which it\r\n    often undergoes in hot climates is probably merely a case of\r\n    unequal development; for even with those sheep which like goats are\r\n    covered with hair, a small quantity of underlying wool may always\r\n    be found.[93] In the wild mountain-sheep (_0vis montana_) of North\r\n    America there is an analogous annual change of coat; “the wool\r\n    begins to drop out in early spring, leaving in its place a coat of\r\n    hair resembling that of the elk, a change of pelage quite different\r\n    in character from the ordinary thickening of the coat or hair,\r\n    common to all furred animals in winter,—for instance, in the horse,\r\n    the cow, etc., which shed their winter coat in the spring.”[94]\r\n\r\nA slight difference in climate or pasture sometimes slightly affects\r\nthe fleece, as has been observed even in different districts in\r\nEngland, and is well shown by the great softness of the wool brought\r\nfrom Southern Australia. But it should be observed, as Youatt\r\nrepeatedly insists, that the tendency to change may generally be\r\ncounteracted by careful selection. M. Lasterye, after discussing this\r\nsubject, sums up as follows: “The preservation of the Merino race in\r\nits utmost purity at the Cape of Good Hope, in the marshes of Holland,\r\nand under the rigorous climate of Sweden, furnishes an additional\r\nsupport of this my unalterable principle, that fine-woolled sheep may\r\nbe kept wherever industrious men and intelligent breeders exist.”\r\n\r\n    That methodical selection has effected great changes in several\r\n    breeds of sheep no one who knows anything on the subject,\r\n    entertains a doubt. The case of the Southdowns, as improved by\r\n    Ellman, offers perhaps the most striking instance. Unconscious or\r\n    occasional selection has likewise slowly produced a great effect,\r\n    as we shall see in the chapters on Selection. That crossing has\r\n    largely modified some breeds, no one who will study what has been\r\n    written on this subject—for instance, Mr. Spooner’s paper—will\r\n    dispute; but to produce uniformity in a crossed breed, careful\r\n    selection and “rigorous weeding,” as this author expresses it, are\r\n    indispensable.[95]\r\n\r\n    In some few instances new breeds have suddenly originated; thus, in\r\n    1791, a ram-lamb was born in Massachusetts, having short crooked\r\n    legs and a long back, like a turnspit-dog. From this one lamb the\r\n    _otter_ or _ancon_ semi-monstrous breed was raised; as these sheep\r\n    could not leap over the fences, it was thought that they would be\r\n    valuable; but they have been supplanted by merinos, and thus\r\n    exterminated. The sheep are remarkable from transmitting their\r\n    character so truly that Colonel Humphreys[96] never heard of “but\r\n    one questionable case” of an ancon ram and ewe not producing ancon\r\n    offspring. When they are crossed with other breeds the offspring,\r\n    with rare exceptions, instead of being intermediate in character,\r\n    perfectly resemble either parent; even one of twins has resembled\r\n    one parent and the second the other. Lastly, “the ancons have been\r\n    observed to keep together, separating themselves from the rest of\r\n    the flock when put into enclosures with other sheep.”\r\n\r\nA more interesting case has been recorded in the Report of the Juries\r\nfor the Great Exhibition (1851), namely, the production of a merino\r\nram-lamb on the Mauchamp farm, in 1828, which was remarkable for its\r\nlong, smooth, straight, and silky wool. By the year 1833 M. Graux had\r\nraised rams enough to serve his whole flock, and after a few more years\r\nhe was able to sell stock of his new breed. So peculiar and valuable is\r\nthe wool, that it sells at 25 per cent above the best merino wool: even\r\nthe fleeces of half-bred animals are valuable, and are known in France\r\nas the “Mauchamp-merino.” It is interesting, as showing how generally\r\nany marked deviation of structure is accompanied by other deviations,\r\nthat the first ram and his immediate offspring were of small size, with\r\nlarge heads, long necks, narrow chests, and long flanks; but these\r\nblemishes were removed by judicious crosses and selection. The long\r\nsmooth wool was also correlated with smooth horns; and as horns and\r\nhair are homologous structures, we can understand the meaning of this\r\ncorrelation. If the Mauchamp and ancon breeds had originated a century\r\nor two ago, we should have had no record of their birth; and many a\r\nnaturalist would no doubt have insisted, especially in the case of the\r\nMauchamp race, that they had each descended from, or been crossed with,\r\nsome unknown aboriginal form.\r\n\r\nGOATS.\r\n\r\n    From the recent researches of M. Brandt, most naturalists now\r\n    believe that all our goats are descended from the _Capra ægagrus_\r\n    of the mountains of Asia, possibly mingled with the allied Indian\r\n    species _C. falconeri_ of India.[97] In Switzerland, during the\r\n    neolithic period, the domestic goat was commoner than the sheep;\r\n    and this very ancient race differed in no respect from that now\r\n    common in Switzerland.[98] At the present time, the many races\r\n    found in several parts of the world differ greatly from each other;\r\n    nevertheless, as far as they have been tried,[99] they are all\r\n    quite fertile when crossed. So numerous are the breeds, that Mr. G.\r\n    Clark[100] has described eight distinct kinds imported into the one\r\n    island of Mauritius. The ears of one kind were enormously\r\n    developed, being, as measured by Mr. Clark, no less than 19 inches\r\n    in length and 4-3/4 inches in breadth. As with cattle, the mammæ of\r\n    those breeds which are regularly milked become greatly developed;\r\n    and, as Mr. Clark remarks, “it is not rare to see their teats\r\n    touching the ground.” The following cases are worth notice as\r\n    presenting unusual points of variation. According to Godron,[101]\r\n    the mammæ differ greatly in shape in different breeds, being\r\n    elongated in the common goat, hemispherical in the Angora race, and\r\n    bilobed and divergent in the goats of Syria and Nubia. According to\r\n    this same author, the males of certain breeds have lost their usual\r\n    offensive odour. In one of the Indian breeds the males and females\r\n    have horns of widely-different shapes;[102] and in some breeds the\r\n    females are destitute of horns.[103] M. Ramu of Nancy informs me\r\n    that many of the goats there bear on the upper part of the throat a\r\n    pair of hairy appendages, 70 mm. in length and about 10 mm. in\r\n    diameter, which in external appearance resemble those above\r\n    described on the jaws of pigs. The presence of inter-digital pits\r\n    or glands on all four feet has been thought to characterise the\r\n    genus Ovis, and their absence to be characteristic of the genus\r\n    Capra; but Mr. Hodgson has found that they exist in the front feet\r\n    of the majority of Himalayan goats.[104] Mr. Hodgson measured the\r\n    intestines in two goats of the Dúgú race, and he found that the\r\n    proportional length of the great and small intestines differed\r\n    considerably. In one of these goats the cæcum was thirteen inches,\r\n    and in the other no less than thirty-six inches in length!\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Hermann von Nathusius ‘Die Racen des Schweines,’ Berlin, 1860; and\r\n ‘Vorstudien für Geschichte,’ etc., ‘Schweineschädel,’ Berlin, 1864.\r\n Rütimeyer, ‘Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten,’ Basel, 1861.\r\n\r\n [2] Nathusius, ‘Die Racen des Schweines,’ Berlin, 1860.

Admiral Sulivan, R.N.,\r\n had ample opportunities of observing the wild pigs on Eagle Islet in\r\n the Falklands; and he informs me that they resembled wild boars with\r\n bristly ridged backs and large tusks.

Professor\r\n    Gervais[1] states “that the true wild rabbit is smaller than the\r\n    domestic; its proportions are not absolutely the same; its tail is\r\n    smaller; its ears are shorter and more thickly clothed with hair;\r\n    and these characters, without speaking of colour, are so many\r\n    indications opposed to the opinion which unites these animals under\r\n    the same specific denomination.” Few naturalists will agree with\r\n    this author that such slight differences are sufficient to separate\r\n    as distinct species the wild and domestic rabbit. How extraordinary\r\n    it would be, if close confinement, perfect tameness, unnatural\r\n    food, and careful breeding, all prolonged during many generations,\r\n    had not produced at least some effect! The tame rabbit has been\r\n    domesticated from an ancient period. Confucius ranges rabbits among\r\n    animals worthy to be sacrificed to the gods, and, as he prescribes\r\n    their multiplication, they were probably at this early period\r\n    domesticated in China. They are mentioned by several of the\r\n    classical writers. In 1631 Gervaise Markham writes, “You shall not,\r\n    as in other cattell, looke to their shape, but to their richnesse,\r\n    onely elect your buckes, the largest and goodliest conies you can\r\n    get; and for the richnesse of the skin, that is accounted the\r\n    richest which hath the equallest mixture of blacke and white haire\r\n    together, yet the blacke rather shadowing the white; the furre\r\n    should be thicke, deepe, smooth, and shining; ... they are of body\r\n    much fatter and larger, and, when another skin is worth two or\r\n    three pence, they are worth two shillings.” From this full\r\n    description we see that silver-grey rabbits existed in England at\r\n    this period; and what is far more important, we see that the\r\n    breeding or selection of rabbits was then carefully attended to.\r\n    Aldrovandi, in 1637, describes, on the authority of several old\r\n    writers (as Scaliger, in 1557), rabbits of various colours, some\r\n    “like a hare,” and he adds that P. Valerianus (who died a very old\r\n    man in 1558) saw at Verona rabbits four times bigger than ours.[2]\r\n\r\n    From the fact of the rabbit having been domesticated at an ancient\r\n    period, we must look to the northern hemisphere of the Old World,\r\n    and to the warmer temperate regions alone, for the aboriginal\r\n    parent-form; for the rabbit cannot live without protection in\r\n    countries as cold as Sweden, and, though it has run wild in the\r\n    tropical island of Jamaica, it has never greatly multiplied there.\r\n    It now exists, and has long existed, in the warmer temperate parts\r\n    of Europe, for fossil remains have been found in several\r\n    countries.[3] The domestic rabbit readily becomes feral in these\r\n    same countries, and when variously coloured kinds are turned out\r\n    they generally revert to the ordinary grey colour.[4] Wild rabbits,\r\n    if taken young, can be domesticated, though the process is\r\n    generally very troublesome.[5] The various domestic races are often\r\n    crossed, and are believed to be quite fertile together, and a\r\n    perfect gradation can be shown to exist from the largest domestic\r\n    kinds, having enormously developed ears, to the common wild kind.\r\n    The parent-form must have been a burrowing animal, a habit not\r\n    common, as far as I can discover, to any other species in the large\r\n    genus Lepus. Only one wild species is known with certainty to exist\r\n    in Europe; but the rabbit (if it be a true rabbit) from Mount\r\n    Sinai, and likewise that from Algeria, present slight differences;\r\n    and these forms have been considered by some authors as\r\n    specifically distinct.[6] But such slight differences would aid us\r\n    little in explaining the more considerable differences\r\n    characteristic of the several domestic races. If the latter are the\r\n    descendants of two or more closely allied species, these, with the\r\n    exception of the common rabbit, have been exterminated in a wild\r\n    state; and this is very improbable, seeing with what pertinacity\r\n    this animal holds its ground. From these several reasons we may\r\n    infer with safety that all the domestic breeds are the descendants\r\n    of the common wild species. But from what we hear of the marvellous\r\n    success in France in rearing hybrids between the hare and\r\n    rabbit,[7] it is possible, though not probable, from the great\r\n    difficulty in making the first cross, that some of the larger\r\n    races, which are coloured like the hare, may have been modified by\r\n    crosses with this animal. Nevertheless, the chief differences in\r\n    the skeletons of the several domestic breeds cannot, as we shall\r\n    presently see, have been derived from a cross with the hare.\r\n\r\n    There are many breeds which transmit their characters more or less\r\n    truly. Every one has seen the enormous lop-eared rabbits exhibited\r\n    at our shows; various allied sub-breeds are reared on the\r\n    Continent, such as the so-called Andalusian, which is said to have\r\n    a large head with a round forehead, and to attain a greater size\r\n    than any other kind; another large Paris breed is named the\r\n    Rouennais, and has a square head; the so-called Patagonian rabbit\r\n    has remarkably short ears and a large round head. Although I have\r\n    not seen all these breeds, I feel some doubt about there being any\r\n    marked difference in the shape of their skulls.[8] English\r\n    lop-eared rabbits often weigh 8 pounds or 10 pounds, and one has\r\n    been exhibited weighing 18 pounds; whereas a full-sized wild rabbit\r\n    weighs only about 3-1/4 pounds. The head or skull in all the large\r\n    lop-eared rabbits examined by me is much longer relatively to its\r\n    breadth than in the wild rabbit. Many of them have loose transverse\r\n    folds of skin or dewlaps beneath the throat, which can be pulled\r\n    out so as to reach nearly to the ends of the jaws. Their ears are\r\n    prodigiously developed, and hang down on each side of their faces.\r\n    A rabbit was exhibited in 1867 with its two ears, measured from the\r\n    tip of one to the tip of the other, 22 inches in length, and each\r\n    ear 5-3/8 inches in breadth. In 1869 one was exhibited with ears,\r\n    measured in the same manner, 23-1/8 in length and 5-1/2 in breadth;\r\n    “thus exceeding any rabbit ever exhibited at a prize show.” In a\r\n    common wild rabbit I found that the length of two ears, from tip to\r\n    tip, was 7-5/8 inches, and the breadth only 1-7/8 inch. The weight\r\n    of body in the larger rabbits, and the development of their ears,\r\n    are the qualities which win prizes, and have been carefully\r\n    selected.\r\n\r\n    The hare-coloured, or, as it is sometimes called, the Belgian\r\n    rabbit, differs in nothing except colour from the other large\r\n    breeds; but Mr. J. Young, of Southampton, a great breeder of this\r\n    kind, informs me that the females, in all the specimens examined by\r\n    him, had only six mammæ and this certainly was the case with two\r\n    females which came into my possession. Mr. B. P. Brent, however,\r\n    assures me that the number is variable with other domestic rabbits.\r\n    The common wild rabbit always has ten mammæ. The Angora rabbit is\r\n    remarkable from the length and fineness of its fur, which even on\r\n    the soles of the feet is of considerable length. This breed is the\r\n    only one which differs in its mental qualities, for it is said to\r\n    be much more sociable than other rabbits, and the male shows no\r\n    wish to destroy its young.[9] Two live rabbits were brought to me\r\n    from Moscow, of about the size of the wild species, but with long\r\n    soft fur, different from that of the Angora. These Moscow rabbits\r\n    had pink eyes and were snow-white, excepting the ears, two spots\r\n    near the nose, the upper and under surface of the tail, and the\r\n    hinder tarsi, which were blackish-brown. In short, they were\r\n    coloured nearly like the so-called Himalayan rabbits, presently to\r\n    be described, and differed from them only in the character of their\r\n    fur. There are two other breeds which come true to colour, but\r\n    differ in no other respect, namely silver-greys and chinchillas.\r\n    Lastly, the Nicard or Dutch rabbit may be mentioned, which varies\r\n    in colour, and is remarkable from its small size, some specimens\r\n    weighing only 1-1/4 pounds; rabbits of this breed make excellent\r\n    nurses for other and more delicate kinds.[10]\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 5—Half-lop Rabbit.\r\n\r\n    Certain characters are remarkably fluctuating, or are very feebly\r\n    transmitted by domestic rabbits: thus, one breeder tells me that\r\n    with the smaller kinds he has hardly ever raised a whole litter of\r\n    the same colour: with the large lop-eared breeds “it is\r\n    impossible,” says a great judge,[11] “to breed true to colour, but\r\n    by judicious crossing a great deal may be done towards it. The\r\n    fancier should know how his does are bred, that is, the colour of\r\n    their parents.” Nevertheless, certain colours, as we shall\r\n    presently see, are transmitted truly. The dewlap is not strictly\r\n    inherited. Lop-eared rabbits, with their ears hanging down flat on\r\n    each side of the face, do not transmit this character at all truly.\r\n    Mr. Delamer remarks that, “with fancy rabbits, when both the\r\n    parents are perfectly formed, have model ears, and are handsomely\r\n    marked, their progeny do not invariably turn out the same.” When\r\n    one parent, or even both, are oar-laps, that is, have their ears\r\n    sticking out at right angles, or when one parent or both are\r\n    half-lops, that is, have only one ear dependent, there is nearly as\r\n    good a chance of the progeny having both ears full-lop, as if both\r\n    parents had been thus characterised. But I am informed, if both\r\n    parents have upright ears, there is hardly a chance of a full-lop.\r\n    In some half-lops the ear that hangs down is broader and longer\r\n    than the upright ear;[12] so that we have the unusual case of a\r\n    want of symmetry on the two sides. This difference in the position\r\n    and size of the two ears probably indicates that the lopping\r\n    results from the great length and weight of the ear, favoured no\r\n    doubt by the weakness of the muscles consequent on disuse.\r\n    Anderson[13] mentions a breed having only a single ear; and\r\n    Professor Gervais another breed destitute of ears.\r\n\r\n    We come now to the Himalayan breed, which is sometimes called\r\n    Chinese, Polish, or Russian. These pretty rabbits are white, or\r\n    occasionally yellow, excepting their ears, nose, feet, and the\r\n    upper side of the tail, which are all brownish-black; but as they\r\n    have red eyes, they may be considered as albinoes. I have received\r\n    several accounts of their breeding perfectly true. From their\r\n    symmetrical marks, they were at first ranked as specifically\r\n    distinct, and were provisionally named _L. nigripes._[14] Some good\r\n    observers thought that they could detect a difference in their\r\n    habits, and stoutly maintained that they formed a new species. The\r\n    origin of this breed is so curious, both in itself and as throwing\r\n    some light on the complex laws of inheritance that it is worth\r\n    giving in detail. But it is first necessary briefly to describe two\r\n    other breeds: silver-greys or silver-sprigs generally have black\r\n    heads and legs, and their fine grey fur is interspersed with\r\n    numerous black and white long hairs. They breed perfectly true, and\r\n    have long been kept in warrens. When they escape and cross with\r\n    common rabbits, the product, as I hear from Mr. Wyrley Birch, of\r\n    Wretham Hall, is not a mixture of the two colours, but about half\r\n    take after the one parent, and the other half after the other\r\n    parent. Secondly, chinchillas or tame silver-greys (I will use the\r\n    former name) have short, paler, mouse or slate-coloured fur,\r\n    interspersed with long, blackish, slate-coloured, and white\r\n    hairs.[15] These rabbits breed perfectly true. A writer stated in\r\n    1857[16] that he had produced Himalayan rabbits in the following\r\n    manner. He had a breed of chinchillas which had been crossed with\r\n    the common black rabbit, and their offspring were either blacks or\r\n    chinchillas. These latter were again crossed with other chinchillas\r\n    (which had also been crossed with silver-greys), and from this\r\n    complicated cross Himalayan rabbits were raised. From these and\r\n    other similar statements, Mr. Bartlett[17] was led to make a\r\n    careful trial in the Zoological Gardens, and he found that by\r\n    simply crossing silver-greys with chinchillas he could always\r\n    produce some few Himalayans; and the latter, notwithstanding their\r\n    sudden origin, if kept separate, bred perfectly true. But I have\r\n    recently been assured the pure silver-greys of any sub-breed\r\n    occasionally produce Himalayans.\r\n\r\n    The Himalayans, when first born, are quite white, and are then true\r\n    albinoes; but in the course of a few months they gradually assume\r\n    their dark ears, nose, feet, and tail. Occasionally, however, as I\r\n    am informed by Mr. W. A. Wooler and the Rev. W. D. Fox, the young\r\n    are born of a very pale grey colour, and specimens of such fur were\r\n    sent me by the former gentleman. The grey tint, however, disappears\r\n    as the animal comes to maturity. So that with these Himalayans\r\n    there is a tendency, strictly confined to early youth, to revert to\r\n    the colour of the adult silver-grey parent-stock. Silver-greys and\r\n    chinchillas, on the other hand, present a remarkable contrast with\r\n    the Himalayans in their colour whilst quite young, for they are\r\n    born perfectly black, but soon assume their characteristic grey or\r\n    silver tints. The same thing occurs with grey horses, which, as\r\n    long as they are foals, are generally of a nearly black colour, but\r\n    soon become grey, and get whiter and whiter as they grow older.\r\n    Hence the usual rule is that Himalayans are born white and\r\n    afterwards become in certain parts of their bodies dark-coloured;\r\n    whilst silver-greys are born black and afterwards become sprinkled\r\n    with white. Exceptions, however, and of a directly opposite nature,\r\n    occasionally occur in both cases. For young silver-greys are\r\n    sometimes born in warrens, as I hear from Mr. W. Birch, of a\r\n    cream-colour, but these young animals ultimately become black. The\r\n    Himalayans, on the other hand, sometimes produce, as is stated by\r\n    an experienced amateur,[18] a single black young one in a litter;\r\n    and this, before two months elapse, becomes perfectly white.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the whole curious case: wild silver-greys may be considered\r\nas black rabbits which become grey at an early period of life. When\r\nthey are crossed with common rabbits, the offspring are said not to\r\nhave blended colours, but to take after either parent; and in this\r\nrespect they resemble black and albino varieties of most quadrupeds,\r\nwhich often transmit their colours in this same manner. When they are\r\ncrossed with chinchillas, that is, with a paler sub-variety, the young\r\nare at first pure albinoes, but soon become dark-coloured in certain\r\nparts of their bodies, and are then called Himalayans. The young\r\nHimalayans, however, are sometimes at first either pale grey or\r\ncompletely black, in either case changing after a time to white. In a\r\nfuture chapter I shall advance a large body of facts showing that, when\r\ntwo varieties are crossed both of which differ in colour from their\r\nparent-stock, there is a strong tendency in the young to revert to the\r\naboriginal colour; and what is very remarkable, this reversion\r\noccasionally supervenes, not before birth, but during the growth of the\r\nanimal. Hence, if it could be shown that silver-greys and chinchillas\r\nwere the offspring of a cross between a black and albino variety with\r\nthe colours intimately blended—a supposition in itself not improbable,\r\nand supported by the circumstance of silver-greys in warrens sometimes\r\nproducing creamy-white young, which ultimately become black—then all\r\nthe above given paradoxical facts on the changes of colour in\r\nsilver-greys and in their descendants the Himalayans would come under\r\nthe law of reversion, supervening at different periods of growth and in\r\ndifferent degrees, either to the original black or to the original\r\nalbino parent-variety.\r\n\r\n    It is, also, remarkable that Himalayans, though produced so\r\n    suddenly; breed true. But as, whilst young, they are albinoes, the\r\n    case falls under a very general rule; albinism being well known to\r\n    be strongly inherited, for instance with white mice and many other\r\n    quadrupeds, and even white flowers. But why, it may be asked, do\r\n    the ears, tail, nose, and feet, and no other part of the body,\r\n    revert to a black colour? This apparently depends on a law, which\r\n    generally holds good, namely, that characters common to many\r\n    species of a genus—and this, in fact, implies long inheritance from\r\n    the ancient progenitor of the genus—are found to resist variation,\r\n    or to reappear if lost, more persistently than the characters which\r\n    are confined to the separate species. Now, in the genus Lepus, a\r\n    large majority of the species have their ears and the upper surface\r\n    of the tail tinted black; but the persistence of these marks is\r\n    best seen in those species which in winter become white: thus, in\r\n    Scotland the _L. variabilis_[19] in its winter dress has a shade of\r\n    colour on its nose, and the tips of its ears are black: in the _L.\r\n    tibetanus_ the ears are black, the upper surface of the tail\r\n    greyish-black, and the soles of the feet brown: in _L. glacialis_\r\n    the winter fur is pure white, except the soles of the feet and the\r\n    points of the ears. Even in the variously-coloured fancy rabbits we\r\n    may often observe a tendency in these same parts to be more darkly\r\n    tinted than the rest of the body. Thus the several coloured marks\r\n    on the Himalayan rabbits, as they grow old, are rendered\r\n    intelligible. I may add a nearly analogous case: fancy rabbits very\r\n    often have a white star on their foreheads; and the common English\r\n    hare, whilst young, generally has, as I have myself observed, a\r\n    similar white star on its forehead.\r\n\r\n    When variously coloured rabbits are set free in Europe, and are\r\n    thus placed under their natural conditions, they generally revert\r\n    to the aboriginal grey colour; this may be in part due to the\r\n    tendency in all crossed animals, as lately observed, to revert to\r\n    their primordial state. But this tendency does not always prevail;\r\n    thus silver-grey rabbits are kept in warrens, and remain true\r\n    though living almost in a state of nature; but a warren must not be\r\n    stocked with both silver-greys and common rabbits; otherwise “in a\r\n    few years there will be none but common greys surviving.”[20] When\r\n    rabbits run wild in foreign countries under new conditions of life,\r\n    they by no means always revert to their aboriginal colour. In\r\n    Jamaica the feral rabbits are described as having been\r\n    “slate-coloured, deeply tinted with sprinklings of white on the\r\n    neck, on the shoulders, and on the back; softening off to\r\n    blue-white under the breast and belly.”[21] But in this tropical\r\n    island the conditions were not favourable to their increase, and\r\n    they never spread widely, and are now extinct, as I hear from Mr.\r\n    R. Hill, owing to a great fire which occurred in the woods. Rabbits\r\n    during many years have run wild in the Falkland Islands; they are\r\n    abundant in certain parts, but do not spread extensively. Most of\r\n    them are of the common grey colour; a few, as I am informed by\r\n    Admiral Sulivan, are hare-coloured, and many are black, often with\r\n    nearly symmetrical white marks on their faces. Hence, M. Lesson\r\n    described the black variety as a distinct species, under the name\r\n    of _Lepus magellanicus,_ but this, as I have elsewhere shown, is an\r\n    error.[22] Within recent times the sealers have stocked some of the\r\n    small outlying islets in the Falkland group with rabbits; and on\r\n    Pebble Islet, as I hear from Admiral Sulivan, a large proportion\r\n    are hare-coloured, whereas on Rabbit Islet a large proportion are\r\n    of a bluish colour, which is not elsewhere seen. How the rabbits\r\n    were coloured which were turned out of these islets is not known.\r\n\r\n    The rabbits which have become feral on the island of Porto Santo,\r\n    near Madeira, deserve a fuller account. In 1418 or 1419, J.\r\n    Gonzales Zarco[23] happened to have a female rabbit on board which\r\n    had produced young during the voyage, and he turned them all out on\r\n    the island. These animals soon increased so rapidly, that they\r\n    became a nuisance, and actually caused the abandonment of the\r\n    settlement. Thirty-seven years subsequently, Cada Mosto describes\r\n    them as innumerable; nor is this surprising, as the island was not\r\n    inhabited by any beast of prey or by any terrestrial mammal. We do\r\n    not know the character of the mother-rabbit; but it was probably\r\n    the common domesticated kind. The Spanish peninsula, whence Zarco\r\n    sailed, is known to have abounded with the common wild species at\r\n    the most remote historical period; and as these rabbits were taken\r\n    on board for food, it is improbable that they should have been of\r\n    any peculiar breed. That the breed was well domesticated is shown\r\n    by the doe having littered during the voyage. Mr. Wollaston, at my\r\n    request, brought home two of these feral rabbits in spirits of\r\n    wine; and, subsequently, Mr. W. Haywood sent to me three more\r\n    specimens in brine, and two alive. These seven specimens, though\r\n    caught at different periods, closely resembled each other. They\r\n    were full grown, as shown by the state of their bones. Although the\r\n    conditions of life in Porto Santo are evidently highly favourable\r\n    to rabbits, as proved by their extraordinarily rapid increase, yet\r\n    they differ conspicuously in their small size from the wild English\r\n    rabbit. Four English rabbits, measured from the incisors to the\r\n    anus, varied between 17 and 17-3/4 inches in length; whilst two of\r\n    the Porto Santo rabbits were only 14-1/2 and 15 inches in length.\r\n    But the decrease in size is best shown by weight; four wild English\r\n    rabbits averaged 3 pounds 5 ounces, whilst one of the Porto Santo\r\n    rabbits, which had lived for four years in the Zoological Gardens,\r\n    but had become thin, weighed only 1 pound 9 ounces. A fairer test\r\n    is afforded by the comparison of the well-cleaned limb-bones of a\r\n    Porto Santo rabbit killed on the island with the same bones of a\r\n    wild English rabbit of average size, and they differed in the\r\n    proportion of rather less than five to nine. So that the Porto\r\n    Santo rabbits have decreased nearly three inches in length, and\r\n    almost half in weight of body.[24] The head has not decreased in\r\n    length proportionally with the body; and the capacity of the brain\r\n    case is, as we shall hereafter see, singularly variable. I prepared\r\n    four skulls, and these resembled each other more closely than do\r\n    generally the skulls of wild English rabbits; but the only\r\n    difference in structure which they presented was that the\r\n    supra-orbital processes of the frontal bones were narrower.\r\n\r\nIn colour the Porto Santo rabbit differs considerably from the common\r\nrabbit; the upper surface is redder, and is rarely interspersed with\r\nany black or black-tipped hairs. The throat and certain parts of the\r\nunder surface, instead of being pure white, are generally pale grey or\r\nleaden colour. But the most remarkable difference is in the ears and\r\ntail; I have examined many fresh English rabbits, and the large\r\ncollection of skins in the British Museum from various countries, and\r\nall have the upper surface of the tail and the tips of the ears clothed\r\nwith blackish-grey fur; and this is given in most works as one of the\r\nspecific characters of the rabbit. Now in the seven Porto Santo rabbits\r\nthe upper surface of the tail was reddish-brown, and the tips of the\r\nears had no trace of the black edging. But here we meet with a singular\r\ncircumstance: in June, 1861 I examined two of these rabbits recently\r\nsent to the Zoological Gardens, and their tails and ears were coloured\r\nas just described; but when one of their dead bodies was sent to me in\r\nFebruary, 1865, the ears were plainly edged, and the upper surface of\r\nthe tail was covered with blackish-grey fur, and the whole body was\r\nmuch less red; so that under the English climate this individual rabbit\r\nhad recovered the proper colour of its fur in rather less than four\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nThe two little Porto Santo rabbits, whilst alive in the Zoological\r\nGardens, had a remarkably different appearance from the common kind.\r\nThey were extraordinarily wild and active, so that many persons\r\nexclaimed on seeing them that they were more like large rats than\r\nrabbits. They were nocturnal to an unusual degree in their habits, and\r\ntheir wildness was never in the least subdued; so that the\r\nsuperintendent, Mr. Bartlett, assured me that he had never had a wilder\r\nanimal under his charge. This is a singular fact, considering that they\r\nare descended from a domesticated breed. I was so much surprised at it,\r\nthat I requested Mr. Haywood to make inquiries on the spot, whether\r\nthey were much hunted by the inhabitants, or persecuted by hawks, or\r\ncats, or other animals; but this is not the case, and no cause can be\r\nassigned for their wildness. They live both on the central, higher\r\nrocky land and near the sea-cliffs, and, from being exceedingly shy and\r\ntimid, seldom appear in the lower and cultivated districts. They are\r\nsaid to produce from four to six young at a birth, and their breeding\r\nseason is in July and August. Lastly, and this is a highly remarkable\r\nfact, Mr. Bartlett could never succeed in getting these two rabbits,\r\nwhich were both males, to associate or breed with the females of\r\nseveral breeds which were repeatedly placed with them.\r\n\r\nIf the history of these Porto Santo rabbits had not been known, most\r\nnaturalists, on observing their much reduced size, their colour,\r\nreddish above and grey beneath, their tails and ears not tipped with\r\nblack, would have ranked them as a distinct species. They would have\r\nbeen strongly confirmed in this view by seeing them alive in the\r\nZoological Gardens, and hearing that they refused to couple with other\r\nrabbits. Yet this rabbit, which there can be little doubt would thus\r\nhave been ranked as a distinct species, as certainly originated since\r\nthe year 1420. Finally, from the three cases of the rabbits which have\r\nrun wild in Porto Santo, Jamaica, and the Falkland Islands, we see that\r\nthese animals do not, under new conditions of life, revert to or retain\r\ntheir aboriginal character, as is so generally asserted to be the case\r\nby most authors.\r\n\r\n_Osteological Characters._\r\n\r\nWhen we remember, on the one hand, how frequently it is stated that\r\nimportant parts of the structure never vary; and, on the other hand, on\r\nwhat small differences in the skeleton fossil species have often been\r\nfounded, the variability of the skull and of some other bones in the\r\ndomesticated rabbit well deserves attention. It must not be supposed\r\nthat the more important differences immediately to be described\r\nstrictly characterise any one breed; all that can be said is, that they\r\nare generally present in certain breeds. We should bear in mind that\r\nselection has not been applied to fix any character in the skeleton,\r\nand that the animals have not had to support themselves under uniform\r\nhabits of life. We cannot account for most of the differences in the\r\nskeleton; but we shall see that the increased size of the body, due to\r\ncareful nurture and continued selection, has affected the head in a\r\nparticular manner. Even the elongation and lopping of the ears have\r\ninfluenced in a small degree the form of the whole skull. The want of\r\nexercise has apparently modified the proportional length of the limbs\r\nin comparison with that of the body.\r\n\r\nAs a standard of comparison, I prepared skeletons of two wild rabbits\r\nfrom Kent, one from the Shetland Islands, and one from Antrim in\r\nIreland. As all the bones in these four specimens from such distant\r\nlocalities closely resembled each other, presenting scarcely any\r\nappreciable difference, it may be concluded that the bones of the wild\r\nrabbit are generally uniform in character.\r\n\r\n_Skull._—I have carefully examined skulls of ten large lop-eared\r\nrabbits, and of five common domestic rabbits, which latter differ from\r\nthe lop-eared only in not having such large bodies or ears, yet both\r\nlarger than in the wild rabbit. First for the ten lop-eared rabbits: in\r\nall these the skull is remarkably elongated in comparison with its\r\nbreadth. In a wild rabbit the length was 3·15 inches, in a large fancy\r\nrabbit 4·3; whilst the breadth of the cranium enclosing the brain was\r\nin both almost exactly the same. Even by taking as the standard of\r\ncomparison the widest part of the zygomatic arch, the skulls of the\r\nlop-eared are proportionally to their breadth three-quarters of an inch\r\ntoo long. The depth of the head has increased almost in the same\r\nproportion with the length; it is the breadth alone which has not\r\nincreased. The parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are\r\nless arched, both in a longitudinal and transverse line, than in the\r\nwild rabbit, so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different.\r\nThe surface is rougher, less cleanly sculptured, and the lines of\r\nsutures are more prominent.\r\n\r\nAlthough the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits in comparison with\r\nthose of the wild rabbit are much elongated relatively to their\r\nbreadth, yet, relatively to the size of body, they are far from\r\nelongated. The lop-eared rabbits which I examined were, though not fat,\r\nmore than twice as heavy as the wild specimens; but the skull was very\r\nfar from being twice as long. Even if we take the fairer standard of\r\nthe length of body, from the nose to the anus, the skull is not on an\r\naverage as long as it ought to be by a third of an inch. In the small\r\nferal Porto Santo rabbit, on the other hand, the head relatively to the\r\nlength of body is about a quarter of an inch too long.\r\n\r\nThis elongation of the skull relatively to its breadth, I find a\r\nuniversal character, not only with the large lop-eared rabbits, but in\r\nall the artificial breeds; as is well seen in the skull of the Angora.\r\nI was at first much surprised at the fact, and could not imagine why\r\ndomestication could produce this uniform result; but the explanation\r\nseems to lie in the circumstance that during a number of generations\r\nthe artificial races have been closely confined, and have had little\r\noccasion to exert either their senses, or intellect, or voluntary\r\nmuscles; consequently the brain, as we shall presently more fully see,\r\nhas not increased relatively with the size of body. As the brain has\r\nnot increased, the bony case enclosing it has not increased, and this\r\nhas evidently affected through correlation the breadth of the entire\r\nskull from end to end.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 6—Skull of Wild Rabbit. Fig. 7—Skull of large\r\nLop-eared Rabbit.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 8—Part of Zygomatic Arch.\r\n\r\n    In all the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits, the supra-orbital\r\n    plates or processes of the frontal bones are much broader than in\r\n    the wild rabbit, and they generally project more upwards. In the\r\n    zygomatic arch the posterior or projecting point of the malar-bone\r\n    is broader and blunter; and in the specimen, fig. 8, it is so in a\r\n    remarkable degree. This point approaches nearer to the auditory\r\n    meatus than in the wild rabbit, as may be best seen in fig. 8; but\r\n    this circumstance mainly depends on the changed direction of the\r\n    meatus. The inter-parietal bone (see fig. 9) differs much in shape\r\n    in the several skulls; generally it is more oval, that is more\r\n    extended in the line of the longitudinal axis of the skull, than in\r\n    the wild rabbit. The posterior margin of “the square raised\r\n    platform”[25] of the occiput, instead of being truncated, or\r\n    projecting slightly as in the wild rabbit, is in most lop-eared\r\n    rabbits pointed, as in fig. 9, C. The paramastoids relatively to\r\n    the size of the skull are generally much thicker than in the wild\r\n    rabbit.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 9—Posterior end of skull of Rabbits.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 10—Occipital Foramen of Rabbits.\r\n\r\nThe occipital foramen (fig. 10) presents some remarkable differences:\r\nin the wild rabbit, the lower edge between the condyles is considerably\r\nand almost angularly hollowed out, and the upper edge is deeply and\r\nsquarely notched; hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the transverse\r\naxis. In the skulls of the lop-eared rabbits the transverse axis\r\nexceeds the longitudinal; for in none of these skulls was the lower\r\nedge between the condyles so deeply hollowed out; in five of them there\r\nwas no upper square notch, in three there was a trace of the notch, and\r\nin two alone it was well developed. These differences in the shape of\r\nthe foramen are remarkable, considering that it gives passage to so\r\nimportant a structure as the spinal marrow, though apparently the\r\noutline of the latter is not affected by the shape of the passage.\r\n\r\nIn all the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits, the bony auditory\r\nmeatus is conspicuously larger than in the wild rabbit. In a skull 4·3\r\ninches in length, and which barely exceeded in breadth the skull of a\r\nwild rabbit (which was 3·15 inches in length), the longer diameter of\r\nthe meatus was exactly twice as great. The orifice is more compressed,\r\nand its margin on the side nearest the skull stands up higher than the\r\nouter side. The whole meatus is directed more forwards. As in breeding\r\nlop-eared rabbits the length of the ears, and their consequent lopping\r\nand lying flat on the face, are the chief points of excellence, there\r\ncan hardly be a doubt that the great change in the size, form, and\r\ndirection of the bony meatus, relatively to this same part in the wild\r\nrabbit, is due to the continued selection of individuals having larger\r\nand larger ears. The influence of the external ear on the bony meatus\r\nis well shown in the skulls (I have examined three) of half-lops (see\r\nfig. 5), in which one ear stands upright, and the other and longer ear\r\nhangs down; for in these skulls there was a plain difference in the\r\nform and direction of the bony meatus on the two sides. But it is a\r\nmuch more interesting fact, that the changed direction and increased\r\nsize of the bony meatus have slightly affected on the same side the\r\nstructure of the whole skull. I here give a drawing (fig. 11) of the\r\nskull of a half-lop; and it may be observed that the suture between the\r\nparietal and frontal bones does not run strictly at right angles to the\r\nlongitudinal axis of the skull; the left frontal bone projects beyond\r\nthe right one; both the posterior and anterior margins of the left\r\nzygomatic arch on the side of the lopping ear stand a little in advance\r\nof the corresponding bones on the opposite side. Even the lower jaw is\r\naffected, and the condyles are not quite symmetrical, that on the left\r\nstanding a little in advance of that on the right. This seems to me a\r\nremarkable case of correlation of growth. Who would have surmised that\r\nby keeping an animal during many generations under confinement, and so\r\nleading to the disuse of the muscles of the ears, and by continually\r\nselecting individuals with the longest and largest ears, he would thus\r\nindirectly have affected almost every suture in the skull and the form\r\nof the lower jaw!\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 11—Skull of Half-lop Rabbit.\r\n\r\nIn the large lop-eared rabbits the only difference in the lower jaw, in\r\ncomparison with that of the wild rabbit, is that the posterior margin\r\nof the ascending ramus is broader and more inflected. The teeth in\r\nneither jaw present any difference, except that the small incisors,\r\nbeneath the large ones, are proportionately a little longer. The molar\r\nteeth have increased in size proportionately with the increased width\r\nof the skull, measured across the zygomatic arch, and not\r\nproportionally with its increased length. The inner line of the sockets\r\nof the molar teeth in the upper jaw of the wild rabbit forms a\r\nperfectly straight line; but in some of the largest skulls of the\r\nlop-eared this line was plainly bowed inwards. In one specimen there\r\nwas an additional molar tooth on each side of the upper jaw, between\r\nthe molars and premolars; but these two teeth did not correspond in\r\nsize; and as no rodent has seven molars, this is merely a monstrosity,\r\nthough a curious one.\r\n\r\nThe five other skulls of common domestic rabbits, some of which\r\napproach in size the above-described largest skulls, whilst the others\r\nexceed but little those of the wild rabbit, are only worth notice as\r\npresenting a perfect gradation in all the above-specified differences\r\nbetween the skulls of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. In all,\r\nhowever, the supra-orbital plates are rather larger, and in all the\r\nauditory meatus is larger, in conformity with the increased size of the\r\nexternal ears, than in the wild rabbit. The lower notch in the\r\noccipital foramen in some was not so deep as in the wild rabbit, but in\r\nall five skulls the upper notch was well developed.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the _Angora_ rabbit, like the latter five skulls, is\r\nintermediate in general proportions, and in most other characters,\r\nbetween those of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. It presents\r\nonly one singular character: though considerably longer than the skull\r\nof the wild rabbit, the breadth measured within the posterior\r\nsupra-orbital fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild. The\r\nskulls of the _silver-grey,_ and _chinchilla_ and _Himalayan_ rabbits\r\nare more elongated than in the wild, with broader supra-orbital plates,\r\nbut differ little in any other respect, excepting that the upper and\r\nlower notches of the occipital foramen are not so deep or so well\r\ndeveloped. The skull of the _Moscow rabbit_ scarcely differs at all\r\nfrom that of the wild rabbit. In the Porto Santo feral rabbits the\r\nsupra-orbital plates are generally narrower and more pointed than in\r\nour wild rabbits.\r\n\r\nAs some of the largest lop-eared rabbits of which I prepared skeletons\r\nwere coloured almost like hares, and as these latter animals and\r\nrabbits have, as it is affirmed, been recently crossed in France, it\r\nmight be thought that some of the above-described characters had been\r\nderived from a cross at a remote period with the hare. Consequently I\r\nexamined skulls of the hare, but no light could thus be thrown on the\r\npeculiarities of the skulls of the larger rabbits. It is, however, an\r\ninteresting fact, as illustrating the law that varieties of one species\r\noften assume the characters of other species of the same genus, that I\r\nfound, on comparing the skulls of ten species of hares in the British\r\nMuseum, that they differed from each other chiefly in the very same\r\npoints in which domestic rabbits vary,—namely, in general proportions,\r\nin the form and size of the supra-orbital plates, in the form of the\r\nfree end of the malar bone, and in the line of suture separating the\r\noccipital and frontal bones. Moreover two eminently variable characters\r\nin the domestic rabbit, namely, the outline of the occipital foramen\r\nand the shape of the “raised platform” of the occiput, were likewise\r\nvariable in two instances in the same species of hare.\r\n\r\n_Vertebræ._—The number is uniform in all the skeletons which I have\r\nexamined, with two exceptions, namely, in one of the small feral Porto\r\nSanto rabbits and in one of the largest lop-eared kinds; both of these\r\nhad as usual seven cervical, twelve dorsal with ribs, but, instead of\r\nseven lumbar, both had eight lumbar vertebræ. This is remarkable, as\r\nGervais gives seven as the number for the whole genus Lepus. The caudal\r\nvertebræ apparently differ by two or three, but I did not attend to\r\nthem, and they are difficult to count with certainty.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 12—Atlas Vertebræ of Rabbits.\r\n\r\nIn the first cervical vertebra, or atlas, the anterior margin of the\r\nneural arch varies a little in wild specimens, being either nearly\r\nsmooth, or furnished with a small supra-median atlantoid process; I\r\nhave figured a specimen with the largest process (_a_) which I have\r\nseen; but it will be observed how inferior this is in size and\r\ndifferent in shape to that in a large lop-eared rabbit. In the latter,\r\nthe infra-median process (_b_) is also proportionally much thicker and\r\nlonger. The alæ are a little squarer in outline.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 13—Third Cervical Vertebræ, of natural size, of—A.\r\nWild Rabbit; B. Hare-coloured, large, Lop-eared Rabbit.\r\n\r\n_Third cervical vertebra._—In the wild rabbit (fig. 13, A _a_) this\r\nvertebra, viewed on the inferior surface, has a transverse process,\r\nwhich is directed obliquely backwards, and consists of a single pointed\r\nbar; in the fourth vertebra this process is slightly forked in the\r\nmiddle. In the large lop-eared rabbits this process (B _ a_) is forked\r\nin the third vertebra, as in the fourth of the wild rabbit. But the\r\nthird cervical vertebræ of the wild and lop-eared (A _b,_ B _b_)\r\nrabbits differ more conspicuously when their anterior articular\r\nsurfaces are compared; for the extremities of the antero-dorsal\r\nprocesses in the wild rabbit are simply rounded, whilst in the\r\nlop-eared they are trifid, with a deep central pit. The canal for the\r\nspinal marrow in the lop-eared (B _b_) is more elongated in a\r\ntransverse direction than in the wild rabbit; and the passages for the\r\narteries are of a slightly different shape. These several differences\r\nin this vertebra seem to me well deserving attention.\r\n\r\n_First dorsal vertebra._—Its neural spine varies in length in the wild\r\nrabbit; being sometimes very short, but generally more than half as\r\nlong as that of the second dorsal; but I have seen it in two large\r\nlop-eared rabbits three-fourths of the length of that of the second\r\ndorsal vertebra.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 14—Dorsal Vertebræ, from sixth to tenth inclusive,\r\nof natural size, viewed laterally. A. Wild Rabbit. B. Large,\r\nHare-coloured, so-called Spanish Rabbit.\r\n\r\n    _Ninth and tenth dorsal vertebræ._—In the wild rabbit the neural\r\n    spine of the ninth vertebra is just perceptibly thicker than that\r\n    of the eighth; and the neural spine of the tenth is plainly thicker\r\n    and shorter than those of all the anterior vertebræ. In the large\r\n    lop-eared rabbits the neural spines of the tenth, ninth, and eighth\r\n    vertebræ, and even in a slight degree that of the seventh, are very\r\n    much thicker, and of somewhat different shape, in comparison with\r\n    those of the wild rabbit. So that this part of the vertebral column\r\n    differs considerably in appearance from the same part in the wild\r\n    rabbit, and closely resembles in an interesting manner these same\r\n    vertebræ in some species of hares. In the Angora, Chinchilla, and\r\n    Himalayan rabbits, the neural spines of the eighth and ninth\r\n    vertebræ are in a slight degree thicker than in the wild. On the\r\n    other hand, in one of the feral Porto Santo rabbits, which in most\r\n    of its characters deviates from the common wild rabbit, in a\r\n    direction exactly opposite to that assumed by the large lop-eared\r\n    rabbits, the neural spines of the ninth and tenth vertebræ were not\r\n    at all larger than those of the several anterior vertebra. In this\r\n    same Porto Santo specimen there was no trace in the ninth vertebra\r\n    of the anterior lateral processes (see fig. 14), which are plainly\r\n    developed in all British wild rabbits, and still more plainly\r\n    developed in the large lop-eared rabbits. In a half-wild rabbit\r\n    from Sandon Park,[26] a haemal spine was moderately well developed\r\n    on the under side of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, and I have seen\r\n    this in no other specimen.\r\n\r\n_Lumbar vertebræ._—I have stated that in two cases there were eight\r\ninstead of seven lumbar vertebræ. The third lumbar vertebræ in one\r\nskeleton of a wild British rabbit, and in one of the Porto Santo feral\r\nrabbits, had a haemal spine; whilst in four skeletons of large\r\nlop-eared rabbits, and in the Himalayan rabbit, this same vertebra had\r\na well developed hæmal spine.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 15—Terminal bone of Sternum of Rabbits.\r\n\r\n_Pelvis._—In four wild specimens this bone was almost absolutely\r\nidentical in shape; but in several domesticated breeds shades of\r\ndifferences could be distinguished. In the large lop-eared rabbits, the\r\nwhole upper part of the ilium is straighter, or less splayed outwards,\r\nthan in the wild rabbit; and the tuberosity on the inner lip of the\r\nanterior and upper part of the ilium is proportionally more prominent.\r\n\r\n_Sternum._—The posterior end of the posterior sternal bone in the wild\r\nrabbit (fig. 15, A) is thin and slightly enlarged; in some of the large\r\nlop-eared rabbits (B) it is much more enlarged towards the extremity;\r\nwhilst in other specimens (C) it keeps nearly of the same breadth from\r\nend to end, but is much thicker at the extremity.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 16—Acromion of Scapula, of natural size. A. Wild\r\nRabbit. B, C, D, Large, Lop-eared Rabbits.\r\n\r\n_Scapula._—The acromion sends out a rectangular bar, ending in an\r\noblique knob, which latter in the wild rabbit (fig. 16, A) varies a\r\nlittle in shape and size, as does the apex of the acromion in\r\nsharpness, and the part just below the rectangular bar in breadth. But\r\nthe variations in these respects in the wild rabbit are very slight:\r\nwhilst in the large lop-eared rabbits they are considerable. Thus in\r\nsome specimens (B) the oblique terminal knob is developed into a short\r\nbar, forming an obtuse angle with the rectangular bar. In another\r\nspecimen (C) these two unequal bars form nearly a straight line. The\r\napex of the acromion varies much in breadth and sharpness, as may be\r\nseen by comparing figures B, C, and D.\r\n\r\n_Limbs._—In these I could detect no variation; but the bones of the\r\nfeet were too troublesome to compare with much care.\r\n\r\nI have now described all the differences in the skeletons which I have\r\nobserved. It is impossible not to be struck with the high degree of\r\nvariability or plasticity of many of the bones. We see how erroneous\r\nthe often-repeated statement is, that only the crests of the bones\r\nwhich give attachment to muscles vary in shape, and that only parts of\r\nslight importance become modified under domestication. No one will say,\r\nfor instance, that the occipital foramen, or the atlas, or the third\r\ncervical vertebra is a part of slight importance. If the several\r\nvertebræ of the wild and lop-eared rabbits, of which figures have been\r\ngiven, had been found fossil, palæontologists would have declared\r\nwithout hesitation that they had belonged to distinct species.\r\n\r\n_The effects of the use and disuse of parts._—In the large lop-eared\r\nrabbits the relative proportional length of the bones of the same leg,\r\nand of the front and hind legs compared with each other, have remained\r\nnearly the same as in the wild rabbit; but in weight, the bones of the\r\nhind legs apparently have not increased in due proportion with the\r\nfront legs. The weight of the whole body in the large rabbits examined\r\nby me was from twice to twice and a half as great as that of the wild\r\nrabbit; and the weight of the bones of the front and hind limbs taken\r\ntogether (excluding the feet, on account of the difficulty of cleaning\r\nso many small bones) has increased in the large lop-eared rabbits in\r\nnearly the same proportion; consequently in due proportion to the\r\nweight of body which they have to support. If we take the length of the\r\nbody as the standard of comparison, the limbs of the large rabbits have\r\nnot increased in length in due proportion by one inch and a half.\r\nAgain, if we take as the standard of comparison the length of the\r\nskull, which, as we have before seen, has not increased in length in\r\ndue proportion to the length of body, the limbs will be found to be,\r\nproportionally with those of the wild rabbit, from half to\r\nthree-quarters of an inch too short. Hence, whatever standard of\r\ncomparison be taken, the limb-bones of the large lop-eared rabbits have\r\nnot increased in length, though they have in weight, in full proportion\r\nto the other parts of the frame; and this, I presume, may be accounted\r\nfor by the inactive life which during many generations they have spent.\r\nNor has the scapula increased in length in due proportion to the\r\nincreased length of the body.\r\n\r\n    The capacity of the osseous case of the brain is a more interesting\r\n    point, to which I was led to attend by finding, as previously\r\n    stated, that with all domesticated rabbits the length of the skull\r\n    relatively to its breadth has greatly increased in comparison with\r\n    that of the wild rabbits. If we had possessed a large number of\r\n    domesticated rabbits of nearly the same size with the wild rabbits,\r\n    it would have been a simple task to have measured and compared the\r\n    capacities of their skulls. But this is not the case: almost all\r\n    the domestic breeds have larger bodies than wild rabbits, and the\r\n    lop-eared kinds are more than double their weight. As a small\r\n    animal has to exert its senses, intellect, and instincts equally\r\n    with a large animal, we ought not by any means to expect an animal\r\n    twice or thrice as large as another to have a brain of double or\r\n    treble the size.[27] Now, after weighing the bodies of four wild\r\n    rabbits, and of four large but not fattened lop-eared rabbits, I\r\n    find that on an average the wild are to the lop-eared in weight as\r\n    1 to 2·17; in average length of body as 1 to 1·41; whilst in\r\n    capacity of skull they are as 1 to 1·15. Hence we see that the\r\n    capacity of the skull, and consequently the size of the brain, has\r\n    increased but little, relatively to the increased size of the body;\r\n    and this fact explains the narrowness of the skull relatively to\r\n    its length in all domestic rabbits.\r\n\r\n            I     II     III     IV Name of Breed\r\n        WILD AND SEMI-WILD RABBITS.

As these rabbits differ so greatly in size, it is\r\nnecessary to have some standard by which to compare the capacities of\r\ntheir skulls. I have selected the length of skull as the best standard,\r\nfor in the larger rabbits it has not, as already stated, increased in\r\nlength so much as the body; but as the skull, like every other part,\r\nvaries in length, neither it nor any other part affords a perfect\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nIn the first column of figures the extreme length of the skull is given\r\nin inches and decimals. I am aware that these measurements pretend to\r\ngreater accuracy than is possible; but I have found it the least\r\ntrouble to record the exact length which the compass gave. The second\r\nand third columns give the length and weight of body, whenever these\r\nobservations were made. The fourth column gives the capacity of the\r\nskull by the weight of small shot with which the skulls were filled;\r\nbut it is not pretended that these weights are accurate within a few\r\ngrains. In the fifth column the capacity is given which the skull ought\r\nto have had by calculation, according to the length of skull, in\r\ncomparison with that of the wild rabbit No. 1; in the sixth column the\r\ndifference between the actual and calculated capacities, and in the\r\nseventh the percentage of increase or decrease, are given. For\r\ninstance, as the wild rabbit No. 5 has a shorter and lighter body than\r\nthe wild rabbit No. 1, we might have expected that its skull would have\r\nhad less capacity; the actual capacity, as expressed by the weight of\r\nshot, is 875 grains, which is 97 grains less than that of the first\r\nrabbit. But comparing these two rabbits by the length of their skulls,\r\nwe see that in No. 1 the skull is 3·15 inches in length, and in No. 5\r\n2·96 inches in length; according to this ratio, the brain of No. 5\r\nought to have had a capacity of 913 grains of shot, which is above the\r\nactual capacity, but only by 38 grains. Or, to put the case in another\r\nway (as in column vii), the brain of this small rabbit, No. 5, for\r\nevery 100 grains of weight is only 4 grains too light,—that is, it\r\nought, according to the standard rabbit No. 1, to have been 4 per cent\r\nheavier. I have taken the rabbit No. 1 as the standard of comparison\r\nbecause, of the skulls having a full average length, this has the least\r\ncapacity; so that it is the least favourable to the result which I wish\r\nto show, namely, that the brain in all long-domesticated rabbits has\r\ndecreased in size, either actually, or relatively to the length of the\r\nhead and body, in comparison with the brain of the wild rabbit. Had I\r\ntaken the Irish rabbit, No. 3, as the standard, the following results\r\nwould have been somewhat more striking.\r\n\r\nTurning to Table 3: the first four wild rabbits have skulls of the same\r\nlength, and these differ but little in capacity. The Sandon rabbit (No.\r\n4) is interesting, as, though now wild, it is known to be descended\r\nfrom a domesticated breed, as is still shown by its peculiar colouring\r\nand longer body; nevertheless the skull has recovered its normal length\r\nand full capacity. The next three rabbits are wild, but of small size,\r\nand they all have skulls with slightly lessened capacities. The three\r\nPorto Santo feral rabbits (Nos. 8 to 10) offer a perplexing case; their\r\nbodies are greatly reduced in size, as in a lesser degree are their\r\nskulls in length and in actual capacity, in comparison with the skulls\r\nof wild English rabbits. But when we compare the capacities of the\r\nskull in the three Porto Santo rabbits, we observe a surprising\r\ndifference, which does not stand in any relation to the slight\r\ndifference in the length of their skulls, nor, as I believe, to any\r\ndifference in the size of their bodies; but I neglected weighing\r\nseparately their bodies. I can hardly suppose that the medullary matter\r\nof the brain in these three rabbits, living under similar conditions,\r\ncan differ as much as is indicated by the proportional difference of\r\ncapacity in their skulls; nor do I know whether it is possible that one\r\nbrain may contain considerably more fluid than another. Hence I can\r\nthrow no light on this case.\r\n\r\n    Looking to the lower half of Table 3, which gives the measurements\r\n    of domesticated rabbits, we see that in all the capacity of the\r\n    skull is less, but in very various degrees, than might have been\r\n    anticipated according to the length of their skulls, relatively to\r\n    that of the wild rabbit No. 1. In line 22 the average measurements\r\n    of seven large lop-eared rabbits are given. Now the question\r\n    arises, has the average capacity of the skull in these seven large\r\n    rabbits increased as much as might have been expected from the\r\n    greatly increased size of body. We may endeavour to answer this\r\n    question in two ways: in the upper half of the Table we have\r\n    measurements of the skulls of six small wild rabbits (Nos. 5 to\r\n    10), and we find that on an average the skulls are ·18 of an inch\r\n    shorter, and in capacity 91 grains less, than the average length\r\n    and capacity of the three first wild rabbits on the list. The seven\r\n    large lop-eared rabbits, on an average, have skulls 4·11 inches in\r\n    length, and 1136 grains in capacity; so that these skulls have\r\n    increased in length more than five times as much as the skulls of\r\n    the six small wild rabbits have decreased in length; hence we might\r\n    have expected that the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits would\r\n    have increased in capacity five times as much as the skulls of the\r\n    six small rabbits have decreased in capacity; and this would have\r\n    given an average increased capacity of 455 grains, whilst the real\r\n    average increase is only 155 grains. Again, the large lop-eared\r\n    rabbits have bodies of nearly the same weight and size as the\r\n    common hare, but their heads are longer; consequently, if the\r\n    lop-eared rabbits had been wild, it might have been expected that\r\n    their skulls would have had nearly the same capacity as that of the\r\n    skull of the hare. But this is far from being the case; for the\r\n    average capacity of the two hare-skulls (Nos. 23, 24) is so much\r\n    larger than the average capacity of the seven lop-eared skulls,\r\n    that the latter would have to be increased 21 per cent to come up\r\n    to the standard of the hare.[28]\r\n\r\nI have previously remarked that, if we had possessed many domestic\r\nrabbits of the same average size with the wild rabbit, it would have\r\nbeen easy to compare the capacity of their skulls. Now the Himalayan,\r\nMoscow, and Angora rabbits (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table 3) are only a\r\nlittle larger in body and have skulls only a little longer, than the\r\nwild animal, and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is\r\nless than in the wild animal, and considerably less by calculation\r\n(column 7), according to the difference in the length of their skulls.\r\nThe narrowness of the brain-case in these three rabbits could be\r\nplainly seen and proved by external measurement. The Chinchilla rabbit\r\n(No. 14) is a considerably larger animal than the wild rabbit, yet the\r\ncapacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the wild rabbit.\r\nThe Angora rabbit, No. 13, offers the most remarkable case; this animal\r\nin its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of\r\nlong domesticity. It has a considerably longer head and body than the\r\nwild rabbit, but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of\r\neven the little wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length\r\nof skull the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to\r\nhave been! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not\r\nunhealthy nor idiotic. This case of the Angora rabbit so much surprised\r\nme, that I repeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have\r\nalso compared the capacity of the skull of the Angora with that of the\r\nwild rabbit by other standards, namely, by the length and weight of the\r\nbody, and by the weight of the limb-bones; but by all these standards\r\nthe brain appears to be much too small, though in a less degree when\r\nthe standard of the limb-bones was used; and this latter circumstance\r\nmay probably be accounted for by the limbs of this anciently\r\ndomesticated breed having become much reduced in weight, from its\r\nlong-continued inactive life. Hence I infer that in the Angora breed,\r\nwhich is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more\r\nsocial, the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable\r\namount of reduction.\r\n\r\nFrom the several facts above given,—namely, firstly, that the actual\r\ncapacity of the skull in the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora breeds, is\r\nless than in the wild rabbit, though they are in all their dimensions\r\nrather larger animals; secondly, that the capacity of the skull of the\r\nlarge lop-eared rabbits has not been increased in nearly the same ratio\r\nas the capacity of the skull of the smaller wild rabbits has been\r\ndecreased; and thirdly, that the capacity of the skull in these same\r\nlarge lop-eared rabbits is very inferior to that of the hare, an animal\r\nof nearly the same size,—I conclude, notwithstanding the remarkable\r\ndifferences in capacity in the skulls of the small Porto Santo rabbits,\r\nand likewise in the large lop-eared kinds, that in all\r\nlong-domesticated rabbits the brain has either by no means increased in\r\ndue proportion with the increased length of the head and increased size\r\nof the body, or that it has actually decreased in size, relatively to\r\nwhat would have occurred had these animals lived in a state of nature.\r\nWhen we remember that rabbits, from having been domesticated and\r\nclosely confined during many generations, cannot have exerted their\r\nintellect, instincts, senses, and voluntary movements, either in\r\nescaping from various dangers or in searching for food, we may conclude\r\nthat their brains will have been feebly exercised, and consequently\r\nhave suffered in development. We thus see that the most important and\r\ncomplicated organ in the whole organisation is subject to the law of\r\ndecrease in size from disuse.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us sum up the more important modifications which domestic\r\nrabbits have undergone, together with their causes as far as we can\r\nobscurely see them. By the supply of abundant and nutritious food,\r\ntogether with little exercise, and by the continued selection of the\r\nheaviest individuals, the weight of the larger breeds has been more\r\nthan doubled. The bones of the limbs taken together have increased in\r\nweight, in due proportion with the increased weight of body, but the\r\nhind legs have increased less than the front legs; but in length they\r\nhave not increased in due proportion, and this may have been caused by\r\nthe want of proper exercise. With the increased size of the body the\r\nthird cervical has assumed characters proper to the fourth cervical\r\nvertebra; and the eighth and ninth dorsal vertebræ have similarly\r\nassumed characters proper to the tenth and posterior vertebræ. The\r\nskull in the larger breeds has increased in length, but not in due\r\nproportion with the increased length of body; the brain has not duly\r\nincreased in dimensions, or has even actually decreased, and\r\nconsequently the bony case for the brain has remained narrow, and by\r\ncorrelation has affected the bones of the face and the entire length of\r\nthe skull. The skull has thus acquired its characteristic narrowness.\r\nFrom unknown causes the supra-orbital process of the frontal bones and\r\nthe free end of the malar bones have increased in breadth; and in the\r\nlarger breeds the occipital foramen is generally much less deeply\r\nnotched than in wild rabbits. Certain parts of the scapula and the\r\nterminal sternal bones have become highly variable in shape. The ears\r\nhave been increased enormously in length and breadth through continued\r\nselection; their weight, conjoined probably with the disuse of their\r\nmuscles, has caused them to lop downwards; and this has affected the\r\nposition and form of the bony auditory meatus; and this again, by\r\ncorrelation, the position in a slight degree of almost every bone in\r\nthe upper part of the skull, and even the position of the condyles of\r\nthe lower jaw.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] M.

According to a work published in Lisbon in 1717 entitled\r\n ‘Historia Insulana,’ written by a Jesuit, the rabbits were turned out\r\n in 1420. Some authors believe that the island was discovered in 1413.\r\n\r\n [24] Something of the same kind has occurred on the island of Lipari,\r\n where, according to Spallanzani (‘Voyage dans les deux Siciles,’\r\n quoted by Godron, ‘De l’Espèce,’ p. 364), a countryman turned out some\r\n rabbits which multiplied prodigiously, but, says Spallanzani, “les\r\n lapins de l’ile de Lipari sont plus petits que ceux qu’on élève en\r\n domesticité.”\r\n\r\n [25] Waterhouse, ‘Nat. Hist. Mammalia,’ vol. ii. p. 36.\r\n\r\n [26] These rabbits have run wild for a considerable time in Sandon\r\n Park, and in other places in Staffordshire and Shropshire. They\r\n originated, as I have been informed by the gamekeeper, from\r\n variously-coloured domestic rabbits which had been turned out. They\r\n vary in colour; but many are symmetrically coloured, being white with\r\n a streak along the spine, and with the ears and certain marks about\r\n the head of a blackish-grey tint. They have rather longer bodies than\r\n common rabbits.\r\n\r\n [27] _See_ Prof. Owen’s remarks on this subject in his paper on the\r\n ‘Zoological Significance of the Brain, etc., of Man, etc.,’ read\r\n before Brit. Association 1862: with respect to Birds, _see_ ‘Proc.\r\n Zoolog. Soc.,’ Jan. 11, 1848, p. 8.\r\n\r\n [28] This standard is apparently considerably too low, for Dr. Crisp\r\n (‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.,’ 1861, p. 86) gives 210 grains as the actual\r\n weight of the brain of a hare which weighed 7 pounds, and 125 grains\r\n as the weight of the brain of a rabbit which weighed 3 pounds 5\r\n ounces, that is, the same weight as the rabbit No. 1 in my list. Now\r\n the contents of the skull of rabbit No. 1 in shot is in my table 972\r\n grains; and according to Dr. Crisp’s ratio of 125 to 210, the skull of\r\n the hare ought to have contained 1632 grains of shot, instead of only\r\n (in the largest hare in my table) 1455 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. DOMESTIC PIGEONS.\r\n\r\nENUMERATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL BREEDS—INDIVIDUAL\r\nVARIABILITY—VARIATIONS OF A REMARKABLE NATURE—OSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS:\r\nSKULL, LOWER JAW, NUMBER OF vertebræ—CORRELATION OF GROWTH: TONGUE WITH\r\nBEAK; EYELIDS AND NOSTRILS WITH WATTLED SKIN—NUMBER OF WING-FEATHERS,\r\nAND LENGTH OF WING—COLOUR AND DOWN—WEBBED AND FEATHERED FEET—ON THE\r\nEFFECTS OF DISUSE—LENGTH OF FEET IN CORRELATION WITH LENGTH OF\r\nBEAK—LENGTH OF STERNUM, SCAPULA, AND FURCULUM—LENGTH OF WINGS—SUMMARY\r\nON THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERAL BREEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been led to study domestic pigeons with particular care, because\r\nthe evidence that all the domestic races are descended from one known\r\nsource is far clearer than with any other anciently domesticated\r\nanimal. Secondly, because many treatises in several languages, some of\r\nthem old, have been written on the pigeon, so that we are enabled to\r\ntrace the history of several breeds. And lastly, because, from causes\r\nwhich we can partly understand, the amount of variation has been\r\nextraordinarily great. The details will often be tediously minute; but\r\nno one who really wants to understand the progress of change in\r\ndomestic animals, and especially no one who has kept pigeons and has\r\nmarked the great difference between the breeds and the trueness with\r\nwhich most of them propagate their kind, will doubt that this\r\nminuteness is worth while. Notwithstanding the clear evidence that all\r\nthe breeds are the descendants of a single species, I could not\r\npersuade myself until some years had passed that the whole amount of\r\ndifference between them, had arisen since man first domesticated the\r\nwild rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    I have kept alive all the most distinct breeds, which I could\r\n    procure in England or from the Continent; and have prepared\r\n    skeletons of all. I have received skins from Persia, and a large\r\n    number from India and other quarters of the world.[1] Since my\r\n    admission into two of the London pigeon-clubs, I have received the\r\n    kindest assistance from many of the most eminent amateurs.[2]\r\n\r\n    The races of the Pigeon which can be distinguished, and which breed\r\n    true, are very numerous. MM. Boitard and Corbié[3] describe in\r\n    detail 122 kinds; and I could add several European kinds not known\r\n    to them. In India, judging from the skins sent me, there are many\r\n    breeds unknown here; and Sir W. Elliot informs me that a collection\r\n    imported by an Indian merchant into Madras from Cairo and\r\n    Constantinople included several kinds unknown in India. I have no\r\n    doubt that there exist considerably above 150 kinds which breed\r\n    true and have been separately named. But of these the far greater\r\n    number differ from each other only in unimportant characters. Such\r\n    differences will be here entirely passed over, and I shall confine\r\n    myself to the more important points of structure. That many\r\n    important differences exist we shall presently see. I have looked\r\n    through the magnificent collection of the Columbidæ in the British\r\n    Museum, and, with the exception of a few forms (such as the\r\n    Didunculus, Calænas, Goura, etc.), I do not hesitate to affirm that\r\n    some domestic races of the rock-pigeon differ fully as much from\r\n    each other in external characters as do the most distinct natural\r\n    genera. We may look in vain through the 288 known species[4] for a\r\n    beak so small and conical as that of the short-faced tumbler; for\r\n    one so broad and short as that of the barb; for one so long,\r\n    straight, and narrow, with its enormous wattles, as that of the\r\n    English carrier; for an expanded upraised tail like that of the\r\n    fantail; or for an œsophagus like that of the pouter. I do not for\r\n    a moment pretend that the domestic races differ from each other in\r\n    their whole organisation as much as the more distinct natural\r\n    genera. I refer only to external characters, on which, however, it\r\n    must be confessed that most genera of birds have been founded.\r\n    When, in a future chapter, we discuss the principle of selection as\r\n    followed by man, we shall clearly see why the differences between\r\n    the domestic races are almost always confined to external, or at\r\n    least to externally visible, characters.\r\n\r\nOwing to the amount and gradations of difference between the several\r\nbreeds, I have found it indispensable in the following classification\r\nto rank them under Groups, Races, and Sub-races; to which varieties and\r\nsub-varieties, all strictly inheriting their proper characters, must\r\noften be added. Even with the individuals of the same sub-variety, when\r\nlong kept by different fanciers, different strains can sometimes be\r\nrecognised. There can be no doubt that, if well-characterised forms of\r\nthe several races had been found wild, all would have been ranked as\r\ndistinct species, and several of them would certainly have been placed\r\nby ornithologists in distinct genera. A good classification of the\r\nvarious domestic breeds is extremely difficult, owing to the manner in\r\nwhich many of the forms graduate into each other; but it is curious how\r\nexactly the same difficulties are encountered, and the same rules have\r\nto be followed, as in the classification of any natural but difficult\r\ngroup of organic beings. An “artificial classification” might be\r\nfollowed which would present fewer difficulties than a “natural\r\nclassification;” but then it would interrupt many plain affinities.\r\nExtreme forms can readily be defined; but intermediate and troublesome\r\nforms often destroy our definitions. Forms which may be called\r\n“aberrant” must sometimes be included within groups to which they do\r\nnot accurately belong. Characters of all kinds must be used; but as\r\nwith birds in a state of nature, those afforded by the beak are the\r\nbest and most readily appreciated. It is not possible to weigh the\r\nimportance of all the characters which have to be used so as to make\r\nthe groups and sub-groups of equal value. Lastly, a group may contain\r\nonly one race, and another and less distinctly defined group may\r\ncontain several races and sub-races, and in this case it is difficult,\r\nas in the classification of natural species, to avoid placing too high\r\na value on the number of forms which a group may contain.\r\n\r\n    In my measurements I have never trusted to the eye; and when\r\n    speaking of a part being large or small, I always refer to the wild\r\n    rock-pigeon (_Columba livia_) as the standard of comparison. The\r\n    measurements are given in decimals of an inch.[5]\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 17—The Rock-Pigeon, or Columba livia.[6] The\r\nparent-form of all domesticated pigeons.\r\n\r\n_COLUMBA LIVIA_ or ROCK-PIGEON.\r\n\r\nIllustration:\r\n\r\nIllustration:\r\n\r\nI will now give a brief description of all the principal breeds. The\r\ndiagram above may aid the reader in learning their names and seeing\r\ntheir affinities. The rock-pigeon, or _ Columba livia_ (including under\r\nthis name two or three closely-allied sub-species or geographical\r\nraces, hereafter to be described), may be confidently viewed, as we\r\nshall see in the next chapter, as the common parent-form. The names in\r\nitalics on the right-hand side of the page show us the most distinct\r\nbreeds, or those which have undergone the greatest amount of\r\nmodification. The lengths of the dotted lines rudely represent the\r\ndegree of distinctness of each breed from the parent-stock, and the\r\nnames placed under each other in the columns show the more or less\r\nclosely connecting links. The distances of the dotted lines from each\r\nother approximately represent the amount of difference between the\r\nseveral breeds.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 18—English Pouter.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.\r\n\r\nThis group includes a single race, that of the Pouters. If the most\r\nstrongly marked sub-race be taken, namely, the Improved English Pouter,\r\nthis is perhaps the most distinct of all domesticated pigeons.\r\n\r\n      Race I. Pouter Pigeons.\r\n      (Kropftauben, German. Grosses-gorges, or Boulans, French.)\r\n\r\n_Œsophagus of great size, barely separated from the crop, often\r\ninflated. Body and legs elongated. Beak of moderate dimensions._\r\n\r\n_Sub-race I._—The improved English Pouter, when its crop is fully\r\ninflated, presents a truly astonishing appearance. The habit of\r\nslightly inflating the crop is common to all domestic pigeons, but is\r\ncarried to an extreme in the Pouter. The crop does not differ, except\r\nin size, from that of other pigeons; but is less plainly separated by\r\nan oblique constriction from the œsophagus. The diameter of the upper\r\npart of the œsophagus is immense, even close up to the head. The beak\r\nin one bird which I possessed was almost completely buried when the\r\nœsophagus was fully expanded. The males, especially when excited, pout\r\nmore than the females, and they glory in exercising this power. If a\r\nbird will not, to use the technical expression, “play,” the fancier, as\r\nI have witnessed, by taking the beak into his mouth, blows him up like\r\na balloon; and the bird, then puffed up with wind and pride, struts\r\nabout, retaining his magnificent size as long as he can. Pouters often\r\ntake flight with their crops inflated. After one of my birds had\r\nswallowed a good meal of peas and water, as he flew up in order to\r\ndisgorge them and feed his nearly fledged young, I heard the peas\r\nrattling in his inflated crop as if in a bladder. When flying, they\r\noften strike the backs of their wings together, and thus make a\r\nclapping noise.\r\n\r\nPouters stand remarkably upright, and their bodies are thin and\r\nelongated. In connexion with this form of body, the ribs are generally\r\nbroader and the vertebræ more numerous than in other breeds. From their\r\nmanner of standing their legs appear longer than they really are,\r\nthough, in proportion with those of _C. livia_, the legs and feet are\r\nactually longer. The wings appear much elongated, but by measurement,\r\nin relation to the length of body, this is not the case. The beak\r\nlikewise appears longer, but it is in fact a little shorter (about ·03\r\nof an inch), proportionally with the size of the body, and relatively\r\nto the beak of the rock-pigeon. The Pouter, though not bulky, is a\r\nlarge bird; I measured one which was 34½ inches from tip to tip of\r\nwing, and 19 inches from tip of beak to end of tail. In a wild\r\nrock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands the same measurements gave only\r\n28¼ and 14¾. There are many sub-varieties of the Pouter of different\r\ncolours, but these I pass over.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Dutch Pouter._—This seems to be the parent-form of\r\n    our improved English Pouters. I kept a pair, but I suspect that\r\n    they were not pure birds. They are smaller than English pouters,\r\n    and less well developed in all their characters. Neumeister[7] says\r\n    that the wings are crossed over the tail, and do not reach to its\r\n    extremity.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. The Lille Pouter._—I know this breed only from\r\n    description.[8] It approaches in general form the Dutch Pouter, but\r\n    the inflated œsophagus assumes a spherical form, as if the pigeon\r\n    had swallowed a large orange, which had stuck close under the beak.\r\n    This inflated ball is represented as rising to a level with the\r\n    crown of the head. The middle toe alone is feathered. A variety of\r\n    this sub-race, called the claquant, is described by MM. Boitard and\r\n    Corbié; it pouts but little, and is characterised by the habit of\r\n    violently hitting its wings together over its back,—a habit which\r\n    the English Pouter has in a slight degree.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race IV. Common German Pouter._—I know this bird only from the\r\nfigures and description given by the accurate Neumeister, one of the\r\nfew writers on pigeons who, as I have found, may always be trusted.\r\nThis sub-race seems considerably different. The upper part of the\r\nœsophagus is much less distended. The bird stands less upright. The\r\nfeet are not feathered, and the legs and beak are shorter. In these\r\nrespects there is an approach in form to the common rock-pigeon. The\r\ntail-feathers are very long, yet the tips of the closed wings extend\r\nbeyond the end of the tail; and the length of the wings, from tip to\r\ntip, and of the body, is greater than in the English Pouter.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 19—English Carrier.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.\r\n\r\nThis group includes three Races, namely, Carriers, Runts, and Barbs,\r\nwhich are manifestly allied to each other. Indeed, certain carriers and\r\nrunts pass into each other by such insensible gradations that an\r\narbitrary line has to be drawn between them. Carriers also graduate\r\nthrough foreign breeds into the rock-pigeon. Yet, if well-characterised\r\nCarriers and Barbs (see figs 19 and 20) had existed as wild species, no\r\nornithologist would have placed them in the same genus with each other\r\nor with the rock-pigeon. This group may, as a general rule, be\r\nrecognised by the beak being long, with the skin over the nostrils\r\nswollen and often carunculated or wattled, and with that round the eyes\r\nbare and likewise carunculated. The mouth is very wide, and the feet\r\nare large. Nevertheless the Barb, which must be classed in this same\r\ngroup, has a very short beak, and some runts have very little bare skin\r\nround their eyes.\r\n\r\nRace II.—Carriers.\r\n      (Türkische Tauben; pigeons turcs, dragons.)\r\n\r\n_Beak elongated, narrow, pointed; eyes surrounded by much naked,\r\ngenerally carunculated, skin; neck and body elongated._\r\n\r\n_Sub-race I. The English Carrier._—This is a fine bird, of large size,\r\nclose feathered, generally dark-coloured, with an elongated neck. The\r\nbeak is attenuated and of wonderful length: in one specimen it was 1·4\r\ninch in length from the feathered base to the tip; therefore nearly\r\ntwice as long as that of the rock-pigeon, which measured only ·77.\r\nWhenever I compare proportionally any part in the carrier and\r\nrock-pigeon, I take the length of the body from the base of the beak to\r\nthe end of the tail as the standard of comparison; and according to\r\nthis standard, the beak in one Carrier was nearly half an inch longer\r\nthan in the rock-pigeon. The upper mandible is often slightly arched.\r\nThe tongue is very long. The development of the carunculated skin or\r\nwattle round the eyes, over the nostrils, and on the lower mandible, is\r\nprodigious. The eyelids, measured longitudinally, were in some\r\nspecimens exactly twice as long as in the rock-pigeon. The external\r\norifice or furrow of the nostrils was also twice as long. The open\r\nmouth in its widest part was in one case ·75 of an inch in width,\r\nwhereas in the rock-pigeon it is only about ·4 of an inch. This great\r\nwidth of mouth is shown in the skeleton by the reflexed edges of the\r\nramus of the lower jaw. The head is flat on the summit and narrow\r\nbetween the orbits. The feet are large and coarse; the length, as\r\nmeasured from end of hind toe to end of middle toe (without the claws),\r\nwas in two specimens 2·6 inches; and this, proportionally with the\r\nrock-pigeon, is an excess of nearly a quarter of an inch. One very fine\r\nCarrier measured 31½ inches from tip to tip of wing. Birds of this\r\nsub-race are too valuable to be flown as carriers.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race II. Dragons; Persian Carriers._—The English Dragon differs\r\nfrom the improved English Carrier in being smaller in all its\r\ndimensions, and in having less wattle round the eyes and over the\r\nnostrils, and none on the lower mandible. Sir W. Elliot sent me from\r\nMadras a Bagdad Carrier (sometimes called khandesi), the name of which\r\nshows its Persian origin: it would be considered here a very poor\r\nDragon; the body was of the size of the rock-pigeon, with the beak a\r\nlittle longer, namely, 1 inch from the tip to the feathered base. The\r\nskin round the eyes was only slightly wattled, whilst that over the\r\nnostrils was fairly wattled. The Hon. C. Murray, also, sent me two\r\nCarriers direct from Persia; these had nearly the same character as the\r\nMadras bird, being about as large as the rock-pigeon, but the beak in\r\none specimen was as much as 1·15 in length; the skin over the nostrils\r\nwas only moderately, and that round the eyes scarcely at all wattled.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. Bagadotten-Tauben of Neumeister_ (Pavdotten-or\r\n    Hocker-Tauben).—I owe to the kindness of Mr. Baily, jun., a dead\r\n    specimen of this singular breed imported from Germany. It is\r\n    certainly allied to the Runts; nevertheless, from its close\r\n    affinity with Carriers, it will be convenient here to describe it.\r\n    The beak is long, and is hooked or bowed downwards in a highly\r\n    remarkable manner, as will be seen in fig. 24-D when I treat of the\r\n    skeleton. The eyes are surrounded by a wide space of bright red\r\n    skin, which, as well as that over the nostrils, is moderately\r\n    wattled. The breast-bone is remarkably protuberant, being abruptly\r\n    bowed outwards. The feet and tarsi are of great length, larger than\r\n    in first-rate English Carriers. The whole bird is of large size,\r\n    but in proportion to the size of the body the feathers of the wing\r\n    and tail are short; a wild rock-pigeon, of considerably less size,\r\n    had tail-feathers 4·6 inches in length, whereas in the large\r\n    Bagadotten these feathers were scarcely over 4·1 inches in length.\r\n    Riedel[9] remarks that it is a very silent bird.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Bussorah Carrier._—Two specimens were sent me by Sir\r\n    W. Elliot from Madras, one in spirits and the other skinned. The\r\n    name shows its Persian origin. It is much valued in India, and is\r\n    considered as a distinct breed from the Bagdad Carrier, which forms\r\n    my second sub-race. At first I suspected that these two sub-races\r\n    might have been recently formed by crosses with other breeds,\r\n    though the estimation in which they are held renders this\r\n    improbable; but in a Persian treatise,[10] believed to have been\r\n    written about 100 years ago, the Bagdad and Bussorah breeds are\r\n    described as distinct. The Bussorah Carrier is of about the same\r\n    size as the wild rock-pigeon. The shape of the beak, with some\r\n    little carunculated skin over the nostrils,— the much elongated\r\n    eyelids,—the broad mouth measured internally,—the narrow head,—the\r\n    feet proportionally a little longer than in the rock-pigeon,—and\r\n    the general appearance, all show that this bird is an undoubted\r\n    Carrier; yet in one specimen the beak was of exactly the same\r\n    length as in the rock-pigeon. In the other specimen the beak (as\r\n    well as the opening of the nostrils) was only a very little longer,\r\n    viz., by ·08 of an inch. Although there was a considerable space of\r\n    bare and slightly carunculated skin round the eyes, that over the\r\n    nostrils was only in a slight degree rugose. Sir W. Elliot informs\r\n    me that in the living bird the eye seems remarkably large and\r\n    prominent, and the same fact is noticed in the Persian treatise;\r\n    but the bony orbit is barely larger than that in the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nAmongst the several breeds sent to me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot\r\nthere is a pair of the _Kali Par_, black birds with the beak slightly\r\nelongated, with the skin over the nostrils rather full, and with a\r\nlittle naked skin round the eyes. This breed seems more closely allied\r\nto the Carrier than to any other breed, being nearly intermediate\r\nbetween the Bussorah Carrier and the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe names applied in different parts of Europe and in India to the\r\nseveral kinds of Carriers all point to Persia or the surrounding\r\ncountries as the source of this Race. And it deserves especial notice\r\nthat, even if we neglect the Kali Par as of doubtful origin, we get a\r\nseries broken by very small steps, from the rock-pigeon, through the\r\nBussorah, which sometimes has a beak not at all longer than that of the\r\nrock-pigeon and with the naked skin round the eyes and over the\r\nnostrils very slightly swollen and carunculated, through the Bagdad\r\nsub-race and Dragons, to our improved English Carriers, which present\r\nso marvellous a difference from the rock-pigeon or _Columba livia._\r\n\r\n      Race III.—Runts.\r\n      (Scanderoons: die Florentiner Tauben and Hinkeltauben of\r\n      Neumeister; pigeon bagadais, pigeon romain.)\r\n\r\n_Beak long, massive; body of great size._\r\n\r\nInextricable confusion reigns in the classification, affinities, and\r\nnaming of Runts. Several characters which are generally pretty constant\r\nin other pigeons, such as the length of the wings, tail, legs, and\r\nneck, and the amount of naked skin round the eyes, are excessively\r\nvariable in Runts. When the naked skin over the nostrils and round the\r\neyes is considerably developed and wattled, and when the size of body\r\nis not very great, Runts graduate in so insensible a manner into\r\nCarriers, that the distinction is quite arbitrary. This fact is\r\nlikewise shown by the names given to them in different parts of Europe.\r\nNevertheless, taking the most distinct forms, at least five sub-races\r\n(some of them including well-marked varieties) can be distinguished,\r\nwhich differ in such important points of structure, that they would be\r\nconsidered as good species in a state of nature.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race I. Scanderoon of English Writers_ (die Florentiner and\r\nHinkeltauben of Neumeister).—Birds of this sub-race, of which I kept\r\none alive and have since seen two others, differ from the Bagadotten of\r\nNeumeister only in not having the beak nearly so much curved downwards,\r\nand in the naked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils being hardly\r\nat all wattled. Nevertheless I have felt myself compelled to place the\r\nBagadotten in Race II., or that of the Carriers, and the present bird\r\nin Race III., or that of the Runts. The Scanderoon has a very short,\r\nnarrow, and elevated tail; wings extremely short, so that the first\r\nprimary feathers were not longer than those of a small tumbler pigeon!\r\nNeck long, much bowed; breast-bone prominent. Beak long, being 1·15\r\ninch from tip to feathered base; vertically thick; slightly curved\r\ndownwards. The skin over the nostrils swollen, not wattled; naked skin\r\nround the eyes, broad, slightly carunculated. Legs long; feet very\r\nlarge. Skin of neck bright red, often showing a naked medial line, with\r\na naked red patch at the distal end of the radius of the wing. My bird,\r\nas measured from the base of the beak to the root of the tail, was\r\nfully 2 inches longer than the rock-pigeon; yet the tail itself was\r\nonly 4 inches in length, whereas in the rock-pigeon, which is a much\r\nsmaller bird, the tail is 4-5/8 inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe Hinkel-or Florentiner Taube of Neumeister (Table 13 fig. 1) agrees\r\nwith the above description in all the specified characters (for the\r\nbeak is not mentioned), except that Neumeister expressly says that the\r\nneck is short, whereas in my Scanderoon it was remarkably long and\r\nbowed; so that the Hinkel forms a well-marked variety.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race II. Pigeon cygne and Pigeon bagadais of Boitard and Corbié_\r\n(Scanderoon of French writers).—I kept two of these birds alive,\r\nimported from France. They differed from the first sub-race or true\r\nScanderoon in the much greater length of the wing and tail, in the beak\r\nnot being so long, and in the skin about the head being more\r\ncarunculated. The skin of the neck is red; but the naked patches on the\r\nwings are absent. One of my birds measured 38½ inches from tip to tip\r\nof wing. By taking the length of the body as the standard of\r\ncomparison, the two wings were no less than 5 inches longer than those\r\nof the rock-pigeon! The tail was 6¼ inches in length, and therefore 2¼\r\ninches longer than that of the Scanderoon,—a bird of nearly the same\r\nsize. The beak is longer, thicker, and broader than in the rock-pigeon,\r\nproportionally with the size of body. The eyelids, nostrils, and\r\ninternal gape of mouth are all proportionally very large, as in\r\nCarriers. The foot, from the end of the middle to end of hind toe, was\r\nactually 2·85 inches in length, which is an excess of ·32 of an inch\r\nover the foot of the rock-pigeon, proportionally to the relative size\r\nof the two birds.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. Spanish and Roman Runts._—I am not sure that I am\r\n    right in placing these Runts in a distinct sub-race; yet, if we\r\n    take well-characterised birds, there can be no doubt of the\r\n    propriety of the separation. They are heavy, massive birds, with\r\n    shorter necks, legs, and beaks than in the foregoing races. The\r\n    skin over the nostrils is swollen, but not carunculated; the naked\r\n    skin round the eyes is not very wide, and only slightly\r\n    carunculated; and I have seen a fine so-called Spanish Runt with\r\n    hardly any naked skin round the eyes. Of the two varieties to be\r\n    seen in England, one, which is the rarer, has very long wings and\r\n    tail, and agrees pretty closely with the last sub-race; the other,\r\n    with shorter wings and tail, is apparently the _Pigeon romain\r\n    ordinaire_ of Boitard and Corbié. These Runts are apt to tremble\r\n    like Fantails. They are bad flyers. A few years ago Mr.\r\n    Gulliver[11] exhibited a Runt which weighed 1 pound 14 ounces; and,\r\n    as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, two Runts from the south of\r\n    France were lately exhibited at the Crystal Palace, each of which\r\n    weighed 2 pounds 2½ ounces. A very fine rock-pigeon from the\r\n    Shetland Islands weighed only 14½ ounces.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race IV. Tronfo of Aldrovandi_ (Leghorn Runt?).—In Aldrovandi’s\r\nwork published in 1600 there is a coarse woodcut of a great Italian\r\npigeon, with an elevated tail, short legs, massive body, and with the\r\nbeak short and thick. I had imagined that this latter character so\r\nabnormal in the group, was merely a false representation from bad\r\ndrawing; but Moore, in his work published in 1735, says that he\r\npossessed a Leghorn Runt of which “the beak was very short for so large\r\na bird.” In other respects Moore’s bird resembled the first sub-race or\r\nScanderoon, for it had a long bowed neck, long legs, short beak, and\r\nelevated tail, and not much wattle about the head. So that Aldrovandi’s\r\nand Moore’s birds must have formed distinct varieties, both of which\r\nseem to be now extinct in Europe. Sir W. Elliot, however, informs me\r\nthat he has seen in Madras a short-beaked Runt imported from Cairo.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race V. Murassa (adorned Pigeon) of Madras._—Skins of these\r\nhandsome chequered birds were sent me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot.\r\nThey are rather larger than the largest rock-pigeon, with longer and\r\nmore massive beaks. The skin over the nostrils is rather full and very\r\nslightly carunculated, and they have some naked skin round the eyes;\r\nfeet large. This breed is intermediate between the rock-pigeon and a\r\nvery poor variety of Runt or Carrier.\r\n\r\nFrom these several descriptions we see that with Runts, as with\r\nCarriers, we have a fine gradation from the rock-pigeon (with the\r\nTronfo diverging as a distinct branch) to our largest and most massive\r\nRunts. But the chain of affinities, and many points of resemblance,\r\nbetween Runts and carriers, make me believe that these two races have\r\nnot descended by independent lines from the rock-pigeon, but from some\r\ncommon parent, as represented in the Table, which had already acquired\r\na moderately long beak with slightly swollen skin over the nostrils,\r\nand with some slightly carunculated naked skin round the eyes.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 20—English Barb.\r\n\r\n      Race IV.—Barbs.\r\n      (Indische Tauben; pigeons polonais.)\r\n\r\n_Beak short, broad, deep; naked skin round the eyes, broad and\r\ncarunculated; skin over nostrils slightly swollen._\r\n\r\nMisled by the extraordinary shortness and form of the beak, I did not\r\nat first perceive the near affinity of this Race to that of Carriers\r\nuntil the fact was pointed out to me by Mr. Brent. Subsequently, after\r\nexamining the Bussorah Carrier, I saw that no very great amount of\r\nmodification would be requisite to convert it into a Barb. This view of\r\nthe affinity of Barbs to Carriers is supported by the analogical\r\ndifference between the short and long-beaked Runts; and still more\r\nstrongly by the fact, that, young Barbs and Dragons, within 24 hours\r\nafter being hatched, resemble each other much more closely than do\r\nyoung pigeons of other and equally distinct breeds. At this early age,\r\nthe length of beak, the swollen skin over the rather open nostrils, the\r\ngape of the mouth, and the size of the feet, are the same in both;\r\nalthough these parts afterwards become widely different. We thus see\r\nthat embryology (as the comparison of very young animals may perhaps be\r\ncalled) comes into play in the classification of domestic varieties, as\r\nwith species in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nFanciers, with some truth, compare the head and beak of the Barb to\r\nthat of a bullfinch. The Barb, if found in a state of nature would\r\ncertainly have been placed in a new genus formed for its reception. The\r\nbody is a little larger than that of the rock-pigeon, but the beak is\r\nmore than ·2 of an inch shorter; although shorter, it is both\r\nvertically and horizontally thicker. From the outward flexure of the\r\nrami of the lower jaw, the mouth internally is very broad, in the\r\nproportion of ·6 to ·4 to that of the rock-pigeon. The whole head is\r\nbroad. The skin over the nostril is swollen, but not carunculated,\r\nexcept slightly in first-rate birds when old; whilst the naked skin\r\nround the eye is broad and much carunculated. It is sometimes so much\r\ndeveloped, that a bird belonging to Mr. Harrison Weir could hardly see\r\nto pick up food from the ground. The eyelids in one specimen were\r\nnearly twice as long as those of the rock-pigeon. The feet are coarse\r\nand strong, but proportionally rather shorter than in the rock-pigeon.\r\nThe plumage is generally dark and uniform. Barbs, in short, may be\r\ncalled short-beaked Carriers, bearing the same relation to Carriers\r\nthat the Tronfo of Aldrovandi does to the common Runt.\r\n\r\nGROUP III.\r\n\r\nThis group is artificial, and includes a heterogeneous collection of\r\ndistinct forms. It may be defined by the beak, in well-characterised\r\nspecimens of the several races, being shorter than in the rock-pigeon,\r\nand by the skin round the eyes not being much developed.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 21—English Fantail.\r\n\r\nRace V.—Fantails.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race I. European Fantails_ (Pfauentauben; trembleurs).\r\n\r\n_Tail expanded, directed upwards, formed of many feathers; oil-gland\r\naborted; body and beak rather short._\r\n\r\n    The normal number of tail-feathers in the genus Columba is 12; but\r\n    Fantails have from only 12 (as has been asserted) up to, according\r\n    to MM. Boitard and Corbié, 42. I have counted in one of my own\r\n    birds 33, and at Calcutta Mr. Blyth[12] has counted in an\r\n    _imperfect_ tail 34 feathers. In Madras, as I am informed by Sir W.\r\n    Elliot, 32 is the standard number; but in England number is much\r\n    less valued than the position and expansion of the tail. The\r\n    feathers are arranged in an irregular double row; their permanent\r\n    fanlike expansion and their upward direction are more remarkable\r\n    characters than their increased number. The tail is capable of the\r\n    same movements as in other pigeons, and can be depressed so as to\r\n    sweep the ground. It arises from a more expanded basis than in\r\n    other pigeons; and in three skeletons there were one or two extra\r\n    coccygeal vertebræ. I have examined many specimens of various\r\n    colours from different countries, and there was no trace of the\r\n    oil-gland; this is a curious case of abortion.[13] The neck is thin\r\n    and bowed backwards. The breast is broad and protuberant. The feet\r\n    are small. The carriage of the bird is very different from that of\r\n    other pigeons; in good birds the head touches the tail-feathers,\r\n    which consequently often become crumpled. They habitually tremble\r\n    much: and their necks have an extraordinary, apparently convulsive,\r\n    backward and forward movement. Good birds walk in a singular\r\n    manner, as if their small feet were stiff. Owing to their large\r\n    tails, they fly badly on a windy day. The dark-coloured varieties\r\n    are generally larger than white Fantails.\r\n\r\n    Although between the best and common Fantails, now existing in\r\n    England, there is a vast difference in the position and size of the\r\n    tail, in the carriage of the head and neck, in the convulsive\r\n    movements of the neck, in the manner of walking, and in the breadth\r\n    of the breast, the differences so graduate away, that it is\r\n    impossible to make more than one sub-race. Moore, however, an\r\n    excellent old authority[14] says, that in 1735 there were two sorts\r\n    of broad-tailed shakers (_i.e._ Fantails), “one having a neck much\r\n    longer and more slender than the other;” and I am informed by Mr.\r\n    B. P. Brent, that there is an existing German Fantail with a\r\n    thicker and shorter beak.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race II. Java Fantail._—Mr. Swinhoe sent me from Amoy, in China,\r\nthe skin of a Fantail belonging to a breed known to have been imported\r\nfrom Java. It was coloured in a peculiar manner, unlike any European\r\nFantail; and, for a Fantail, had a remarkably short beak. Although a\r\ngood bird of the kind, it had only 14 tail-feathers; but Mr. Swinhoe\r\nhas counted in other birds of this breed from 18 to 24 tail-feathers.\r\nFrom a rough sketch sent to me, it is evident that the tail is not so\r\nmuch expanded or so much upraised as in even second-rate European\r\nFantails. The bird shakes its neck like our Fantails. It had a\r\nwell-developed oil-gland. Fantails were known in India, as We shall\r\nhereafter see, before the year 1600; and we may suspect that in the\r\nJava Fantail we see the breed in its earlier and less improved\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 22—African Owl.\r\n\r\nRace VI.—Turbit and Owl.\r\n      (Möventauben; pigeons à cravate.)\r\n\r\n_Feathers divergent along the front of the neck and breast; beak very\r\nshort, vertically rather thick; œsophagus somewhat enlarged._\r\n\r\nTurbits and Owls differ from each other slightly in the shape of the\r\nhead; the former have a crest, and the beak is differently curved; but\r\nthey may be here conveniently grouped together. These pretty birds,\r\nsome of which are very small, can be recognised at once by the feathers\r\nirregularly diverging, like a frill, along the front of the neck, in\r\nthe same manner, but in a less degree, as along the back of the neck in\r\nthe Jacobin. They have the remarkable habit of continually and\r\nmomentarily inflating the upper part of the œsophagus, which causes a\r\nmovement in the frill. When the œsophagus of a dead bird is inflated,\r\nit is seen to be larger than in other breeds, and not so distinctly\r\nseparated from the crop. The Pouter inflates both its true crop and\r\nœsophagus; the Turbit inflates in a much less degree the œsophagus\r\nalone. The beak of the Turbit is very short, being ·28 of an inch\r\nshorter than that of the rock-pigeon, proportionally with the size of\r\ntheir bodies; and in some owls brought by Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt from\r\nTunis, it was even shorter. The beak is vertically thicker, and perhaps\r\na little broader, in proportion to that of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n      Race VII.—Tumblers.\r\n      (Tümmler, or Burzeltauben; culbutants.)\r\n\r\n_During flight, tumble backwards; body generally small; beak generally\r\nshort, sometimes excessively short and conical._\r\n\r\nThis race may be divided into four sub-races, namely, Persian, Lotan,\r\nCommon, and short-faced Tumblers. These sub-races include many\r\nvarieties which breed true. I have examined eight skeletons of various\r\nkinds of Tumblers: excepting in one imperfect and doubtful specimen,\r\nthe ribs are only seven in number, whereas the rock-pigeon has eight\r\nribs.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race I. Persian Tumblers._—I received a pair direct from Persia,\r\nfrom the Hon. C. Murray. They are rather smaller birds than the wild\r\nrock-pigeon, about the size of the common dovecot pigeon, white and\r\nmottled, slightly feathered on the feet, with the beak just perceptibly\r\nshorter than in the rock-pigeon. H.M. Consul, Mr. Keith Abbott, informs\r\nme that the difference in the length of beak is so slight, that only\r\npractised Persian fanciers can distinguish these Tumblers from the\r\ncommon pigeon of the country. He informs me that they fly in flocks\r\nhigh up in the air and tumble well. Some of them occasionally appear to\r\nbecome giddy and tumble to the ground, in which respect they resemble\r\nsome of our Tumblers.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Lotan, or Lowtun: Indian Ground Tumblers._—These\r\n    birds present one of the most remarkable inherited habits or\r\n    instincts ever recorded. The specimens sent to me from Madras by\r\n    Sir W. Elliot are white, slightly feathered on the feet, with the\r\n    feathers on the head reversed; and they are rather smaller than the\r\n    rock or dovecot pigeon. The beak is proportionally only slightly\r\n    shorter and rather thinner than in the rock-pigeon. These birds\r\n    when gently shaken and placed on the ground immediately begin\r\n    tumbling head over heels, and they continue thus to tumble until\r\n    taken up and soothed,—the ceremony being generally to blow in their\r\n    faces, as in recovering a person from a state of hypnotism or\r\n    mesmerism. It is asserted that they will continue to roll over till\r\n    they die, if not taken up. There is abundant evidence with respect\r\n    to these remarkable peculiarities; but what makes the case the more\r\n    worthy of attention is, that the habit has been inherited since\r\n    before the year 1600, for the breed is distinctly described in the\r\n    ‘Ayeen Akbery.’[15] Mr. Evans kept a pair in London, imported by\r\n    Captain Vigne; and he assures me that he has seen them tumble in\r\n    the air, as well as in the manner above described on the ground.\r\n    Sir W. Elliot, however, writes to me from Madras, that he is\r\n    informed that they tumble exclusively on the ground, or at a very\r\n    small height above it. He also mentions birds of another\r\n    sub-variety, called the Kalmi Lotan, which begin to roll over if\r\n    only touched on the neck with a rod or wand.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. Common English Tumblers._—These birds have exactly\r\n    the same habits as the Persian Tumbler, but tumble better. The\r\n    English bird is rather smaller than the Persian, and the beak is\r\n    plainly shorter. Compared with the rock-pigeon, and proportionally\r\n    with the size of body, the beak is from ·15 to nearly ·2 of an inch\r\n    shorter, but it is not thinner. There are several varieties of the\r\n    common Tumbler, namely, Baldheads, Beards, and Dutch Rollers. I\r\n    have kept the latter alive; they have differently shaped heads,\r\n    longer necks, and are feather-footed. They tumble to an\r\n    extraordinary degree; as Mr. Brent remarks,[16] “Every few seconds\r\n    over they go; one, two, or three summersaults at a time. Here and\r\n    there a bird gives a very quick and rapid spin, revolving like a\r\n    wheel, though they sometimes lose their balance, and make a rather\r\n    ungraceful fall, in which they occasionally hurt themselves by\r\n    striking some object.” From Madras I have received several\r\n    specimens of the common Tumbler of India, differing slightly from\r\n    each other in the length of their beaks. Mr. Brent sent me a dead\r\n    specimen of a “House-tumbler,”[17] which is a Scotch variety, not\r\n    differing in general appearance and form of beak from the common\r\n    Tumbler. Mr. Brent states that these birds generally begin to\r\n    tumble “almost as soon as they can well fly; at three months old\r\n    they tumble well, but still fly strong; at five or six months they\r\n    tumble excessively; and in the second year they mostly give up\r\n    flying, on account of their tumbling so much and so close to the\r\n    ground. Some fly round with the flock, throwing a clean summersault\r\n    every few yards, till they are obliged to settle from giddiness and\r\n    exhaustion. These are called Air Tumblers, and they commonly throw\r\n    from twenty to thirty summersaults in a minute, each clear and\r\n    clean. I have one red cock that I have on two or three occasions\r\n    timed by my watch, and counted forty summersaults in the minute.\r\n    Others tumble differently. At first they throw a single\r\n    summersault, then it is double, till it becomes a continuous roll,\r\n    which puts an end to flying, for if they fly a few yards over they\r\n    go, and roll till they reach the ground. Thus I had one kill\r\n    herself, and another broke his leg. Many of them turn over only a\r\n    few inches from the ground, and will tumble two or three times in\r\n    flying across their loft. These are called House-tumblers, from\r\n    tumbling in the house. The act of tumbling seems to be one over\r\n    which they have no control, an involuntary movement which they seem\r\n    to try to prevent. I have seen a bird sometimes in his struggles\r\n    fly a yard or two straight upwards, the impulse forcing him\r\n    backwards while he struggles to go forwards. If suddenly startled,\r\n    or in a strange place, they seem less able to fly than if quiet in\r\n    their accustomed loft.” These House-tumblers differ from the Lotan\r\n    or Ground Tumbler of India, in not requiring to be shaken in order\r\n    to begin tumbling. The breed has probably been formed merely by\r\n    selecting the best common Tumblers, though it is possible that they\r\n    may have been crossed at some former period with Lotans.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 23—Short-faced English Tumbler.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Short-faced Tumblers._—These are marvellous birds,\r\n    and are the glory and pride of many fanciers. In their extremely\r\n    short, sharp, and conical beaks, with the skin over the nostrils\r\n    but little developed, they almost depart from the type of the\r\n    Columbidæ. Their heads are nearly globular and upright in front, so\r\n    that some fanciers say[18] “the head should resemble a cherry with\r\n    a barleycorn stuck in it.” These are the smallest kind of pigeons.\r\n    Mr. Esquilant possessed a blue Baldhead, two years old, which when\r\n    alive weighed, before feeding-time, only 6 ounces 5 drs.; two\r\n    others, each weighed 7 ounces. We have seen that a wild rock-pigeon\r\n    weighed 14 ounces 2 drs., and a Runt 34 ounces 4 drs. Short-faced\r\n    Tumblers have a remarkably erect carriage, with prominent breasts,\r\n    drooping wings, and very small feet. The length of the beak from\r\n    the tip to the feathered base was in one good bird only ·4 of an\r\n    inch; in a wild rock-pigeon it was exactly double this length. As\r\n    these Tumblers have shorter bodies than the wild rock-pigeon, they\r\n    ought of course to have shorter beaks; but proportionally with the\r\n    size of the body, the beak is ·28 of an inch too short. So, again,\r\n    the feet of this bird were actually ·45 shorter, and proportionally\r\n    ·21 of an inch shorter, than the feet of the rock-pigeon. The\r\n    middle toe has only twelve or thirteen, instead of fourteen or\r\n    fifteen scutellæ. The primary wing-feathers are not rarely nine\r\n    instead of ten in number. The improved short-faced Tumblers have\r\n    almost lost the power of tumbling; but there are several authentic\r\n    accounts of their occasionally tumbling. There are several\r\n    sub-varieties, such as Bald-heads, Beards, Mottles, and Almonds;\r\n    the latter are remarkable from not acquiring their\r\n    perfectly-coloured plumage until they have moulted three or four\r\n    times. There is good reason to believe that most of these\r\n    sub-varieties, some of which breed truly, have arisen since the\r\n    publication of Moore’s treatise in 1735.[19]\r\n\r\nFinally, in regard to the whole group of Tumblers, it is impossible to\r\nconceive a more perfect gradation than I have now lying before me, from\r\nthe rock-pigeon, through Persian, Lotan, and common Tumblers, up to the\r\nmarvellous short-faced birds; which latter, no ornithologist, judging\r\nfrom mere external structure, would place in the same genus with the\r\nrock-pigeon. The differences between the successive steps in this\r\nseries are not greater than those which may be observed between common\r\ndovecot-pigeons (_C. livia_) brought from different countries.\r\n\r\n      Race VIII.—Indian Frill-back.\r\n\r\n_Beak very short; feathers reversed._\r\n\r\nA specimen of this bird, in spirits, was sent to me from Madras by Sir\r\nW. Elliot. It is wholly different from the Frill-back often exhibited\r\nin England. It is a smallish bird, about the size of the common\r\nTumbler, but has a beak in all its proportions like our short-faced\r\nTumblers. The beak, measured from the tip to the feathered base, was\r\nonly ·46 of an inch in length. The feathers over the whole body are\r\nreversed or curl backwards. Had this bird occurred in Europe, I should\r\nhave thought it only a monstrous variety of our improved Tumbler: but\r\nas short-faced Tumblers are not known in India, I think it must rank as\r\na distinct breed. Probably this is the breed seen by Hasselquist in\r\n1757 at Cairo, and said to have been imported from India.\r\n\r\n      Race IX.—Jacobin.\r\n      (Zopf-or Perrückentaube; nonnain.)\r\n\r\n_Feathers of the neck forming a hood; wings and tail long; beak\r\nmoderately short._\r\n\r\n    This pigeon can at once be recognised by its hood, almost enclosing\r\n    the head and meeting in front of the neck. The hood seems to be\r\n    merely an exaggeration of the crest of reversed feathers on the\r\n    back of the head, which is common to many sub-varieties, and which\r\n    in the Latztaube[20] is in a nearly intermediate state between a\r\n    hood and a crest. The feathers of the hood are elongated. Both the\r\n    wings and tail are likewise much elongated; thus the folded wing of\r\n    the Jacobin, though a somewhat smaller bird, is fully 1¼ inch\r\n    longer than in the rock-pigeon. Taking the length of the body\r\n    without the tail as the standard of comparison, the folded wing,\r\n    proportionally with the wings of the rock-pigeon, is 2¼ inches too\r\n    long, and the two wings, from tip to tip, 5¼ inches too long. In\r\n    disposition this bird is singularly quiet, seldom flying or moving\r\n    about, as Bechstein and Riedel have likewise remarked in\r\n    Germany.[21] The latter author also notices the length of the wings\r\n    and tail. The beak is nearly ·2 of an inch shorter in proportion to\r\n    the size of the body than in the rock-pigeon; but the internal gape\r\n    of the mouth is considerably wider.\r\n\r\nGROUP IV.\r\n\r\nThe birds of this group may be characterised by their resemblance in\r\nall important points of structure, especially in the beak, to the\r\nrock-pigeon. The Trumpeter forms the only well-marked race. Of the\r\nnumerous other sub-races and varieties I shall specify only a few of\r\nthe most distinct, which I have myself seen and kept alive.\r\n\r\n      Race X.—Trumpeter.\r\n      (Trommeltaube; pigeon tambour, glouglou.)\r\n\r\n_A tuft of feathers at the base of the beak curling forward; feet much\r\nfeathered; voice very peculiar; size exceeding that of the\r\nrock-pigeon._\r\n\r\nThis is a well-marked breed, with a peculiar voice, wholly unlike that\r\nof any other pigeon. The coo is rapidly repeated, and is continued for\r\nseveral minutes; hence their name of Trumpeters. They are also\r\ncharacterised by a tuft of elongated feathers, which curls forward over\r\nthe base of the beak, and which is possessed by no other breed. Their\r\nfeet are so heavily feathered, that they almost appear like little\r\nwings. They are larger birds than the rock-pigeon, but their beak is of\r\nvery nearly the same proportional size. Their feet are rather small.\r\nThis breed was perfectly characterised in Moore’s time, in 1735. Mr.\r\nBrent says that two varieties exist, which differ in size.\r\n\r\n      Race XI.—Scarcely differing in structure from the wild _Columba\r\n      livia._\r\n\r\n_Sub-race I. Laughers.—Size less than the Rock-pigeon; voice very\r\npeculiar._—As this bird agrees in nearly all its proportions with the\r\nrock-pigeon, though of smaller size, I should not have thought it\r\nworthy of mention, had it not been for its peculiar voice—a character\r\nsupposed seldom to vary with birds. Although the voice of the Laugher\r\nis very different from that of the Trumpeter, yet one of my Trumpeters\r\nused to utter a single note like that of the Laugher. I have kept two\r\nvarieties of Laughers, which differed only in one variety being\r\nturn-crowned; the smooth-headed kind, for which I am indebted to the\r\nkindness of Mr. Brent, besides its peculiar note, used to coo in a\r\nsingular and pleasing manner, which, independently, struck both Mr.\r\nBrent and myself as resembling that of the turtle-dove. Both varieties\r\ncome from Arabia. This breed was known by Moore in 1735. A pigeon which\r\nseems to say Yak-roo is mentioned in 1600 in the ‘Ayeen Akbery’ and is\r\nprobably the same breed. Sir W. Elliot has also sent me from Madras a\r\npigeon called Yahui, said to have come from Mecca, which does not\r\ndiffer in appearance from the Laugher; it has “a deep melancholy voice,\r\nlike Yahu, often repeated.” Yahu, yahu, means Oh God, oh God; and\r\nSayzid Mohammed Musari, in the treatise written about 100 years ago,\r\nsays that these birds “are not flown, because they repeat the name of\r\nthe most high God.” Mr. Keith Abbott, however, informs me that the\r\ncommon pigeon is called Yahoo in Persia.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race II. Common Frill-back_ (die Strupptaube).—_Beak rather longer\r\nthan in the rock-pigeon; feathers reversed._—This is a considerably\r\nlarger bird than the rock-pigeon, and with the beak, proportionally\r\nwith the size of body, a little (viz. by ·04 of an inch) longer. The\r\nfeathers, especially on the wing-coverts, have their points curled\r\nupwards or back-wards.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race III. Nuns_ (Pigeons coquilles).—These elegant birds are\r\nsmaller than the rock-pigeon. The beak is actually 1·7, and\r\nproportionally with the size of the body ·1 of an inch shorter than in\r\nthe rock-pigeons, although of the same thickness. In young birds the\r\nscutellæ on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leaden-black colour;\r\nand this is a remarkable character (though observed in a lesser degree\r\nin some other breeds), as the colour of the legs in the adult state is\r\nsubject to very little variation in any breed. I have on two or three\r\noccasions counted thirteen or fourteen feathers in the tail; this\r\nlikewise occurs in the barely distinct breed called Helmets. Nuns are\r\nsymmetrically coloured, with the head, primary wing-feathers, tail, and\r\ntail-coverts of the same colour, namely, black or red, and with the\r\nrest of the body white. This breed has retained the same character\r\nsince Aldrovandi wrote in 1600. I have received from Madras almost\r\nsimilarly coloured birds.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Spots_ (die Blasstauben; pigeons heurtés).—These\r\n    birds are a very little larger than the rock-pigeon, with the beak\r\n    a trace smaller in all its dimensions, and with the feet decidedly\r\n    smaller. They are symmetrically coloured, with a spot on the\r\n    forehead, with the tail and tail-coverts of the same colour, the\r\n    rest of the body being white. This breed existed in 1676;[22] and\r\n    in 1735 Moore remarks that they breed truly, as is the case at the\r\n    present day.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race V. Swallows._—These birds, as measured from tip to tip of\r\nwing, or from the end of the beak to the end of the tail, exceed in\r\nsize the rock-pigeon; but their bodies are much less bulky; their feet\r\nand legs are likewise smaller. The beak is of about the same length,\r\nbut rather slighter. Altogether their general appearance is\r\nconsiderably different from that of the rock-pigeon. Their heads and\r\nwings are of the same colour, the rest of the body being white. Their\r\nflight is said to be peculiar. This seems to be a modern breed, which,\r\nhowever, originated before the year 1795 in Germany, for it is\r\ndescribed by Bechstein.\r\n\r\n    Besides the several breeds now described, three or four other very\r\n    distinct kinds existed lately, or perhaps still exist, in Germany\r\n    and France. Firstly, the Karmeliten, or carme pigeon, which I have\r\n    not seen; it is described as of small size, with very short legs,\r\n    and with an extremely short beak. Secondly, the Finnikin, which is\r\n    now extinct in England. It had, according to Moore’s[23] treatise,\r\n    published in 1735, a tuft of feathers on the hinder part of the\r\n    head, which ran down its back not unlike a horse’s mane. “When it\r\n    is salacious it rises over the hen and turns round three or four\r\n    times, flapping its wings, then reverses and turns as many times\r\n    the other way.” The Turner, on the other hand, when it “plays to\r\n    the female, turns only one way.” Whether these extraordinary\r\n    statements may be trusted I know not; but the inheritance of any\r\n    habit may be believed, after what we have seen with respect to the\r\n    Ground-tumbler of India. MM. Boitard and Corbié describe a\r\n    pigeon[24] which has the singular habit of sailing for a\r\n    considerable time through the air, without flapping its wings, like\r\n    a bird of prey. The confusion is inextricable, from the time of\r\n    Aldrovandi in 1600 to the present day, in the accounts published of\r\n    the Draijers, Smiters, Finnikins, Turners, Claquers, etc., which\r\n    are all remarkable from their manner of flight. Mr. Brent informs\r\n    me that he has seen one of these breeds in Germany with its\r\n    wing-feathers injured from having been so often struck together but\r\n    he did not see it flying. An old stuffed specimen of a Finnikin in\r\n    the British Museum presents no well-marked character. Thirdly, a\r\n    singular pigeon with a forked tail is mentioned in some treatises;\r\n    and as Bechstein[25] briefly describes and figures this bird, with\r\n    a tail “having completely the structure of that of the\r\n    house-swallow,” it must once have existed, for Bechstein was far\r\n    too good a naturalist to have confounded any distinct species with\r\n    the domestic pigeon. Lastly, an extraordinary pigeon imported from\r\n    Belgium has lately been exhibited at the Philoperisteron Society in\r\n    London,[26] which “conjoins the colour of an archangel with the\r\n    head of an owl or barb, its most striking peculiarity being the\r\n    extraordinary length of the tail and wing-feathers, the latter\r\n    crossing beyond the tail, and giving to the bird the appearance of\r\n    a gigantic swift (Cypselus), or long-winged hawk.” Mr. Tegetmeier\r\n    informs me that this bird weighed only 10 ounces, but in length was\r\n    15½ inches from tip to beak to end of tail, and 32½ inches from tip\r\n    to tip of wing; now the wild rock-pigeon weighs 14½ ounces, and\r\n    measures from tip to beak to end of tail 15 inches, and from tip to\r\n    tip of wing only 26¾ inches.\r\n\r\nI have now described all the domestic pigeons known to me, and have\r\nadded a few others on reliable authority. I have classed them under\r\nfour Groups, in order to mark their affinities and degrees of\r\ndifference; but the third group is artificial. The kinds examined by me\r\nform eleven races, which include several sub-races; and even these\r\nlatter present differences that would certainly have been thought of\r\nspecific value if observed in a state of nature. The sub-races likewise\r\ninclude many strictly inherited varieties; so that altogether there\r\nmust exist, as previously remarked, above 150 kinds which can be\r\ndistinguished, though generally by characters of extremely slight\r\nimportance. Many of the genera of the Columbidæ, admitted by\r\nornithologists, do not differ in any great degree from each other;\r\ntaking this into consideration, there can be no doubt that several of\r\nthe most strongly characterised domestic forms, if found wild, would\r\nhave been placed in at least five new genera. Thus a new genus would\r\nhave been formed for the reception of the improved English Pouter: a\r\nsecond genus for Carriers and Runts; and this would have been a wide or\r\ncomprehensive genus, for it would have admitted common Spanish Runts\r\nwithout any wattle, short-beaked Runts like the Tronfo, and the\r\nimproved English Carrier: a third genus would have been formed for the\r\nBarb: a fourth for the Fantail: and lastly, a fifth for the short\r\nbeaked, not-wattled pigeons, such as Turbits and short-faced Tumblers.\r\nThe remaining domestic forms might have been included, in the same\r\ngenus with the wild rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n_Individual Variability; variations of a remarkable nature._\r\n\r\nThe differences which we have as yet considered are characteristic of\r\ndistinct breeds; but there are other differences, either confined to\r\nindividual birds, or often observed in certain breeds but not\r\ncharacteristic of them. These individual differences are of importance,\r\nas they might in most cases be secured and accumulated by man’s power\r\nof selection and thus an existing breed might be greatly modified or a\r\nnew one formed. Fanciers notice and select only those slight\r\ndifferences which are externally visible; but the whole organisation is\r\nso tied together by correlation of growth, that a change in one part is\r\nfrequently accompanied by other changes. For our purpose, modifications\r\nof all kinds are equally important, and if affecting a part which does\r\nnot commonly vary, are of more importance than a modification in some\r\nconspicuous part. At the present day any visible deviation of character\r\nin a well-established breed is rejected as a blemish; but it by no\r\nmeans follows that at an early period, before well-marked breeds had\r\nbeen formed, such deviations would have been rejected; on the contrary,\r\nthey would have been eagerly preserved as presenting a novelty, and\r\nwould then have been slowly augmented, as we shall hereafter more\r\nclearly see, by the process of unconscious selection.\r\n\r\n    I have made numerous measurements of the various parts of the body\r\n    in the several breeds, and have hardly ever found them quite the\r\n    same in birds of the same breed,—the differences being greater than\r\n    we commonly meet with in wild species within the same district. To\r\n    begin with the primary feathers of the wing and tail; but I must\r\n    first mention, as some readers may not be aware of the fact, that\r\n    the number of the primary wing and tail-feathers in wild birds is\r\n    generally constant, and characterises, not only whole genera, but\r\n    even whole families. When the tail-feathers are unusually numerous,\r\n    as for instance in the swan, they are apt to be variable in number;\r\n    but this does not apply to the several species and genera of the\r\n    Columbidæ, which never (as far as I can hear) have less than twelve\r\n    or more than sixteen tail-feathers; and these numbers characterise,\r\n    with rare exception, whole sub-families.[27] The wild rock-pigeon\r\n    has twelve tail-feathers. With Fantails, as we have seen, the\r\n    number varies from fourteen to forty-two. In two young birds in the\r\n    same nest I counted twenty-two and twenty-seven feathers. Pouters\r\n    are very liable to have additional tail-feathers, and I have seen\r\n    on several occasions fourteen or fifteen in my own birds. Mr. Bult\r\n    had a specimen, examined by Mr. Yarrell, with seventeen\r\n    tail-feathers. I had a Nun with thirteen, and another with fourteen\r\n    tail-feathers; and in a Helmet, a breed barely distinguishable from\r\n    the Nun, I have counted fifteen, and have heard of other such\r\n    instances. On the other hand, Mr. Brent possessed a Dragon, which\r\n    during its whole life never had more than ten tail-feathers; and\r\n    one of my Dragons, descended from Mr. Brent’s, had only eleven. I\r\n    have seen a Bald-head Tumbler with only ten; and Mr. Brent had an\r\n    Air-Tumbler with the same number, but another with fourteen\r\n    tail-feathers. Two of these latter Tumblers, bred by Mr. Brent,\r\n    were remarkable,—one from having the two central tail-feathers a\r\n    little divergent, and the other from having the two outer feathers\r\n    longer by three-eighths of an inch than the others; so that in both\r\n    cases the tail exhibited a tendency, but in different ways, to\r\n    become forked. And this shows us how a swallow-tailed breed, like\r\n    that described by Bechstein, might have been formed by careful\r\n    selection.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the primary wing-feathers, the number in the Columbidæ,\r\nas far as I can find out, is always nine or ten. In the rock-pigeon it\r\nis ten; but I have seen no less than eight short-faced Tumblers with\r\nonly nine primaries, and the occurrence of this number has been noticed\r\nby fanciers, owing to ten primaries of a white colour being one of the\r\npoints in Short-faced Bald-head-Tumblers. Mr. Brent, however, had an\r\nAir-Tumbler (not short-faced) which had in both wings eleven primaries.\r\nMr. Corker, the eminent breeder of prize Carriers, assures me that some\r\nof his birds had eleven primaries in both wings. I have seen eleven in\r\none wing in two Pouters. I have been assured by three fanciers that\r\nthey have seen twelve in Scanderoons; but as Neumeister asserts that in\r\nthe allied Florence Runt the middle flight-feather is often double, the\r\nnumber twelve may have been caused by two of the ten primaries having\r\neach two shafts to a single feather. The secondary wing-feathers are\r\ndifficult to count, but the number seems to vary from twelve to\r\nfifteen. The length of the wing and tail relatively to the body, and of\r\nthe wings to the tail, certainly varies; I have especially noticed this\r\nin Jacobins. In Mr. Bult’s magnificent collection of Pouters, the wings\r\nand tail varied greatly in length; and were sometimes so much elongated\r\nthat the birds could hardly play upright. In the relative length of the\r\nfew first primaries I have observed only a slight degree of\r\nvariability. Mr. Brent informs me that he has observed the shape of the\r\nfirst feather to vary very slightly. But the variation in these latter\r\npoints is extremely slight compared with the differences which may be\r\nobserved in the natural species of the Columbidæ.\r\n\r\nIn the beak I have seen very considerable differences in birds of the\r\nsame breed, as in carefully bred Jacobins and Trumpeters. In Carriers\r\nthere is often a conspicuous difference in the degree of attenuation\r\nand curvature of the beak. So it is indeed in many breeds: thus I had\r\ntwo strains of black Barbs, which evidently differed in the curvature\r\nof the upper mandible. In width of mouth I have found a great\r\ndifference in two Swallows. In Fantails of first-rate merit I have seen\r\nsome birds with much longer and thinner necks than in others. Other\r\nanalogous facts could be given. We have seen that the oil-gland is\r\naborted in all Fantails (with the exception of the sub-race from Java),\r\nand, I may add, so hereditary is this tendency to abortion, that some,\r\nalthough not all, of the mongrels which I reared from the Fantail and\r\nPouter had no oil-gland; in one Swallow out of many which I have\r\nexamined, and in two Nuns, there was no oil-gland.\r\n\r\n    The number of the scutellæ on the toes often varies in the same\r\n    breed, and sometimes even differs on the two feet of the same\r\n    individual; the Shetland rock-pigeon has fifteen on the middle, and\r\n    six on the hinder toe; whereas I have seen a Runt with sixteen on\r\n    the middle and eight on the hind toe; and a short-faced Tumbler\r\n    with only twelve and five on these same toes. The rock-pigeon has\r\n    no sensible amount of skin between its toes; but I possessed a Spot\r\n    and a Nun with the skin extending for a space of a quarter of an\r\n    inch from the fork, between the two _ inner_ toes. On the other\r\n    hand, as will hereafter be more fully shown, pigeons with feathered\r\n    feet very generally have the bases of their _outer_ toes connected\r\n    by skin. I had a red Tumbler, which had a coo unlike that of its\r\n    fellows, approaching in tone to that of the Laugher: this bird had\r\n    the habit, to a degree which I never saw equalled in any other\r\n    pigeon, of often walking with its wings raised and arched in an\r\n    elegant-manner. I need say nothing on the great variability, in\r\n    almost every breed, in size of body, in colour, in the feathering\r\n    of the feet, and in the feathers on the back of the head being\r\n    reversed. But I may mention a remarkable Tumbler[28] exhibited at\r\n    the Crystal Palace, which had an irregular crest of feathers on its\r\n    head, somewhat like the tuft on the head of the Polish fowl. Mr.\r\n    Bult reared a hen Jacobin with the feathers on the thigh so long as\r\n    to reach the ground, and a cock having, but in a lesser degree, the\r\n    same peculiarity: from these two birds he bred others similarly\r\n    characterised, which were exhibited at the Philoperisteron Soc. I\r\n    bred a mongrel pigeon which had fibrous feathers, and the wing and\r\n    tail-feathers so short and imperfect that the bird could not fly\r\n    even a foot in height.\r\n\r\n    There are many singular and inherited peculiarities in the plumage\r\n    of pigeons: thus Almond-Tumblers do not acquire their perfect\r\n    mottled feathers until they have moulted three or four times: the\r\n    Kite Tumbler is at first brindled black and red with a barred\r\n    appearance, but when “it throws its nest feathers it becomes almost\r\n    black, generally with a bluish tail, and a reddish colour on the\r\n    inner webs of the primary wing-feathers.”[29] Neumeister describes\r\n    a breed of a black colour with white bars on the wing and a white\r\n    crescent-shaped mark on the breast; these marks are generally\r\n    rusty-red before the first moult, but after the third or fourth\r\n    moult they undergo a change; the wing-feathers and the crown of the\r\n    head likewise then become white or grey.[30]\r\n\r\n    It is an important fact, and I believe there is hardly an exception\r\n    to the rule, that the especial characters for which each breed is\r\n    valued are eminently variable: thus, in the Fantail, the number and\r\n    direction of the tail-feathers, the carriage of the body, and the\r\n    degree of trembling are all highly variable points; in Pouters, the\r\n    degree to which they pout, and the shape of their inflated crops;\r\n    in the Carrier, the length, narrowness, and curvature of the beak,\r\n    and the amount of wattle; in Short-faced Tumblers, the shortness of\r\n    the beak, the prominence of the forehead, and general carriage,[31]\r\n    and in the Almond-Tumbler the colour of the plumage; in common\r\n    Tumblers, the manner of tumbling; in the Barb, the breadth and\r\n    shortness of the beak and the amount of eye-wattle; in Runts, the\r\n    size of body; in Turbits the frill; and lastly in Trumpeters, the\r\n    cooing, as well as the size of the tuft of feathers over the\r\n    nostrils. These, which are the distinctive and selected characters\r\n    of the several breeds, are all eminently variable.\r\n\r\n    There is another interesting fact with respect to the characters of\r\n    the several breeds, namely, that they are often most strongly\r\n    displayed in the male bird. In Carriers, when the males and females\r\n    are exhibited in separate pens, the wattle is plainly seen to be\r\n    much more developed in the males, though I have seen a hen Carrier\r\n    belonging to Mr. Haynes heavily wattled. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me\r\n    that, in twenty Barbs in Mr. P. H. Jones’s possession, the males\r\n    had generally the largest eye-wattles; Mr. Esquilant also believes\r\n    in this rule, but Mr. H. Weir, a first-rate judge, entertains some\r\n    doubt on the subject. Male Pouters distend their crops to a much\r\n    greater size than do the females; I have, however, seen a hen in\r\n    the possession of Mr. Evans which pouted excellently; but this is\r\n    an unusual circumstance. Mr. Harrison Weir, a successful breeder of\r\n    prize Fantails, informs me that his male birds often have a greater\r\n    number of tail-feathers than the females. Mr. Eaton asserts[32]\r\n    that if a cock and hen Tumbler were of equal merit, the hen would\r\n    be worth double the money; and as pigeons always pair, so that an\r\n    equal number of both sexes is necessary for reproduction, this\r\n    seems to show that high merit is rarer in the female than in the\r\n    male. In the development of the frill in Turbits, of the hood in\r\n    Jacobins, of the tuft in Trumpeters, of tumbling in Tumblers, there\r\n    is no difference between the males and females. I may here add a\r\n    rather different case, namely, the existence in France[33] of a\r\n    wine-coloured variety of the Pouter, in which the male is generally\r\n    chequered with black, whilst the female is never so chequered. Dr.\r\n    Chapuis also remarks[34] that in certain light-coloured pigeons the\r\n    males have their feathers striated with black, and these striæ\r\n    increase in size at each moult, so that the male ultimately becomes\r\n    spotted with black. With Carriers, the wattle, both on the beak and\r\n    round the eyes, and with Barbs that round the eyes, goes on\r\n    increasing with age. This augmentation of character with advancing\r\n    age, and more especially the difference between the males and\r\n    females in the above-mentioned several respects, are remarkable\r\n    facts, for there is no sensible difference at any age between the\r\n    two sexes in the aboriginal rock-pigeon; and not often any strongly\r\n    marked difference throughout the family of the Columbidæ.[35]\r\n\r\n_Osteological Characters._\r\n\r\nIn the skeletons of the various breeds there is much variability; and\r\nthough certain differences occur frequently, and others rarely, in\r\ncertain breeds, yet none can be said to be absolutely characteristic of\r\nany breed. Considering that strongly-marked domestic races have been\r\nformed chiefly by man’s selection, we ought not to expect to find great\r\nand constant differences in the skeleton; for fanciers neither see, nor\r\ndo they care for, modifications of structure in the internal framework.\r\nNor ought we to expect changes in the skeletons from changed habits of\r\nlife; as every facility is given to the most distinct breeds to follow\r\nthe same habits, and the much modified races are never allowed to\r\nwander abroad and procure their own food in various ways. Moreover, I\r\nfind, on comparing the skeletons of _Columba livia, oenas, palumbus,_\r\nand _turtur_, which are ranked by all systematists in two or three\r\ndistinct though allied genera, that the differences are extremely\r\nslight, certainly less than between the skeletons of some of the most\r\ndistinct domestic breeds. How far the skeleton of the wild rock-pigeon\r\nis constant I have had no means of judging, as I have examined only\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 24—Skulls of Pigeons, viewed laterally.\r\n\r\n_Skull._—The individual bones, especially those at the base, do not\r\ndiffer in shape. But the whole skull, in its proportions, outline, and\r\nrelative direction of the bones, differs greatly in some of the breeds,\r\nas may be seen by comparing the figures of (A) the wild rock-pigeon,\r\n(B) the Short-faced Tumbler, (C) the English Carrier, and (D) the\r\nBagadotten Carrier (of Neumeister), all drawn of the natural size and\r\nviewed laterally. In the Carrier, besides the elongation of the bones\r\nof the face, the space between the orbits is proportionally a little\r\nnarrower than in the rock-pigeon. In the Bagadotten the upper mandible\r\nis remarkably arched, and the premaxillary bones are proportionally\r\nbroader. In the Short-faced Tumbler the skull is more globular: all the\r\nbones of the face are much shortened, and the front of the skull and\r\ndescending nasal bones are almost perpendicular: the maxillo-jugal arch\r\nand premaxillary bones form an almost straight line; the space between\r\nthe prominent edges of the eye-orbits is depressed. In the Barb the\r\npremaxillary bones are much shortened, and their anterior portion is\r\nthicker than in the rock-pigeon, as is the lower part of the nasal\r\nbone. In two Nuns the ascending branches of the premaxillaries, near\r\ntheir tips, were somewhat attenuated, and in these birds, as well as in\r\nsome others, for instance in the Spot, the occipital crest over the\r\nforamen was considerably more prominent than in the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 25—Lower jaws, seen from above.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 26—Skull of Runt.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 27—Lateral view of jaws.\r\n\r\nIn the lower jaw, the articular surface is proportionably smaller in\r\nmany breeds than in the rock-pigeon; and the vertical diameter, more\r\nespecially of the outer part of the articular surface, is considerably\r\nshorter. May not this be accounted for by the lessened use of the jaws,\r\nowing to nutritious food having been given during a long period to all\r\nhighly improved pigeons? In Runts, Carriers, and Barbs (and in a lesser\r\ndegree in several breeds), the whole side of the jaw near the articular\r\nend is bent inwards in a highly remarkable manner; and the superior\r\nmargin of the ramus, beyond the middle, is reflexed in an equally\r\nremarkable manner, as may be seen in fig. 25, in comparison with the\r\njaw of the rock-pigeon. This reflection of the upper margin of the\r\nlower jaw is plainly connected with the singularly wide gape of the\r\nmouth, as has been described in Runts, Carriers, and Barbs. The\r\nreflection is well shown in fig. 26 of the head of a Runt seen from\r\nabove; here a wide open space may be observed on each side, between the\r\nedges of the lower jaw and of the premaxillary bones. In the\r\nrock-pigeon, and in several domestic breeds, the edges of the lower jaw\r\non each side come close up to the premaxillary bones, so that no open\r\nspace is left. The degree of downward curvature of the distal half of\r\nthe lower jaw also differs to an extraordinary degree in some breeds,\r\nas may be seen in the drawings (fig. 27 A) of the rock-pigeon, (B) of\r\nthe Short-faced Tumbler, and (C) of the Bagadotten Carrier of\r\nNeumeister. In some Runts the symphysis of the lower jaw is remarkably\r\nsolid. No one would readily have believed that jaws differing in the\r\nseveral above-specified points so greatly could have belonged to the\r\nsame species.\r\n\r\n    _Vertebræ._—All the breeds have twelve cervical vertebræ.[36] But\r\n    in a Bussorah Carrier from India the twelfth vertebra carried a\r\n    small rib, a quarter of an inch in length, with a perfect double\r\n    articulation.\r\n\r\nThe _dorsal vertebræ_ are always eight. In the rock-pigeon all eight\r\nbear ribs; the eighth rib being very thin, and the seventh having no\r\nprocess. In Pouters all the ribs are extremely broad, eight bear ribs;\r\nthe eighth rib being very thin and the seventh having no process. In\r\nPouters all the ribs are extremely broad, and, in three out of four\r\nskeletons examined by me, the eighth rib was twice or even thrice as\r\nbroad as in the rock-pigeon; and the seventh pair had distinct\r\nprocesses. In many breeds there are only seven ribs, as in seven out of\r\neight skeletons of various Tumblers, and in several skeletons of\r\nFantails, Turbits and Nuns.>\r\n\r\nIn all these breeds the seventh pair was very small, and was destitute\r\nof processes, in which respect it differed from the same rib in the\r\nrock-pigeon. In one Tumbler, and in the Bussorah Carrier, even the\r\nsixth pair had no process. The hypapophysis of the second dorsal\r\nvertebra varies much in development; being sometimes (as in several,\r\nbut not all Tumblers) nearly as prominent as that of the third dorsal\r\nvertebra; and the two hypapophyses together tend to form an ossified\r\narch. The development of the arch, formed by the hypapophyses of the\r\nthird and fourth dorsal vertebræ, also varies considerably, as does the\r\nsize of the hypapophysis of the fifth vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe rock-pigeon has twelve sacral vertebræ; but these vary in number,\r\nrelative size, and distinctness, in the different breeds. In Pouters,\r\nwith their elongated bodies, there are thirteen or even fourteen, and,\r\nas we shall immediately see, an additional number of caudal vertebræ.\r\nIn Runts and Carriers there is generally the proper number, namely\r\ntwelve; but in one Runt, and in the Bussorah Carrier, there were only\r\neleven. In Tumblers there are either eleven, or twelve, or thirteen\r\nsacral vertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe _caudal vertebræ_ are seven in number in the rock-pigeon. In\r\nFantails, which have their tails so largely developed, there are eight\r\nor nine, and apparently in one case ten, and they are a little longer\r\nthan in the rock-pigeon, and their shape varies considerably. Pouters,\r\nalso, have eight or nine caudal vertebræ. I have seen eight in a Nun\r\nand Jacobin. Tumblers, though such small birds, always have the normal\r\nnumber seven; as have Carriers, with one exception, in which there were\r\nonly six.\r\n\r\nThe following table will serve as a summary, and will show the most\r\nremarkable deviations in the number of the vertebra and ribs which I\r\nhave observed:—\r\n\r\n                 Rock Pigeon.     Pouter, from Mr. Bult.     Tumbler,\r\n                 Dutch Roller.     Bussorah Carrier. Cervical\r\n                 Vertebræ     12     12     12     12\r\n          The 12th bore a small rib.

Sacral\r\n          Vertebræ     12     14     11     11 Caudal Vertebræ       7     8\r\n          or 9       7       7 Total Vertebræ     39     42 or\r\n          43     38     38\r\n\r\nThe _pelvis_ differs very little in any breed. The anterior margin of\r\nthe ilium, however, is sometimes a little more equally rounded on both\r\nsides than in the rock-pigeon. The ischium is also frequently rather\r\nmore elongated. The obturator-notch is sometimes, as in many Tumblers,\r\nless developed than in the rock-pigeon. The ridges on the ilium are\r\nvery prominent in most Runts.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 28—Scapulæ of Pigeons.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 29—Furcula of Pigeons.\r\n\r\nIn the bones of the extremities I could detect no difference, except in\r\ntheir proportional lengths; for instance, the metatarsus in a Pouter\r\nwas 1·65 inch, and in a Short-faced Tumbler only ·95 in length; and\r\nthis is a greater difference than would naturally follow from their\r\ndifferently-sized bodies; but long legs in the Pouter, and small feet\r\nin the Tumbler, are selected points. In some Pouters the _scapula_ is\r\nrather straighter, and in some Tumblers it is straighter, with the apex\r\nless elongated, than in the rock-pigeon: in fig. 28, the scapula of the\r\nrock-pigeon (A), and of a short-faced Tumbler (B), are given. The\r\nprocesses at the summit of the _coracoid,_ which receive the\r\nextremities of the furculum, form a more perfect cavity in some\r\nTumblers than in the rock-pigeon: in Pouters these processes are larger\r\nand differently shaped, and the exterior angle of the extremity of the\r\ncoracoid, which is articulated to the sternum, is squarer.\r\n\r\nThe two arms of the _furculum_ in Pouters diverge less, proportionally\r\nto their length, than in the rock-pigeon; and the symphysis is more\r\nsolid and pointed. In Fantails the degree of divergence of the two arms\r\nvaries in a remarkable manner. In fig. 29, B and C represent the\r\nfurcula of two Fantails; and it will be seen that the divergence in B\r\nis rather less even than in the furculum of the short-faced,\r\nsmall-sized Tumbler (A), whereas the divergence in C equals that in a\r\nrock-pigeon, or in the Pouter (D), though the latter is a much larger\r\nbird. The extremities of the furculum, where articulated to the\r\ncoracoids, vary considerably in outline.\r\n\r\nIn the _sternum_ the differences in form are slight, except in the size\r\nand outline of the perforations, which, both in the larger and lesser\r\nsized breeds, are sometimes small. These perforations, also, are\r\nsometimes either nearly circular, or elongated as is often the case\r\nwith Carriers. The posterior perforations occasionally are not\r\ncomplete, being left open posteriorly. The marginal apophyses forming\r\nthe anterior perforations vary greatly in development. The degree of\r\nconvexity of the posterior part of the sternum differs much, being\r\nsometimes almost perfectly flat. The manubrium is rather more prominent\r\nin some individuals than in others, and the pore immediately under it\r\nvaries greatly in size.\r\n\r\n_Correlation of Growth._—By this term I mean that the whole\r\norganisation is so connected, that when one part varies, other parts\r\nvary; but which of two correlated variations ought to be looked at as\r\nthe cause and which as the effect, or whether both result from some\r\ncommon cause, we can seldom or never tell. The point of interest for us\r\nis that, when fanciers, by the continued selection of slight\r\nvariations, have largely modified one part, they often unintentionally\r\nproduce other modifications. For instance, the beak is readily acted on\r\nby selection, and, with its increased or diminished length, the tongue\r\nincreases or diminishes, but not in due proportion; for, in a Barb and\r\nShort-faced Tumbler, both of which have very short beaks, the tongue,\r\ntaking the rock-pigeon as the standard of comparison, was\r\nproportionally not shortened enough, whilst in two Carriers and in a\r\nRunt the tongue, proportionally with the beak, was not lengthened\r\nenough, thus, in a first-rate English Carrier, in which the beak from\r\nthe tip to the feathered base was exactly thrice as long as in a\r\nfirst-rate Short-faced Tumbler, the tongue was only a little more than\r\ntwice as long. But the tongue varies in length independently of the\r\nbeak: thus in a Carrier with a beak 1·2 inch in length, the tongue was\r\n·67 in length: whilst in a Runt which equalled the Carrier in length of\r\nbody and in stretch of wings from tip to tip, the beak was ·92 whilst\r\nthe tongue was ·73 of an inch in length, so that the tongue was\r\nactually longer than in the carrier with its long beak. The tongue of\r\nthe Runt was also very broad at the root. Of two Runts, one had its\r\nbeak longer by ·23 of an inch, whilst its tongue was shorter by ·14\r\nthan in the other.\r\n\r\nWith the increased or diminished length of the beak the length of the\r\nslit forming the external orifice of the nostrils varies, but not in\r\ndue proportion, for, taking the rock-pigeon as the standard, the\r\norifice in a Short-faced Tumbler was not shortened in due proportion\r\nwith its very short beak. On the other hand (and this could not have\r\nbeen anticipated), the orifice in three English Carriers, in the\r\nBagadotten Carrier, and in a Runt (_pigeon cygne_), was longer by above\r\nthe tenth of an inch than would follow from the length of the beak\r\nproportionally with that of the rock-pigeon. In one Carrier the orifice\r\nof the nostrils was thrice as long as in the rock-pigeon, though in\r\nbody and length of beak this bird was not nearly double the size of the\r\nrock-pigeon. This greatly increased length of the orifice of the\r\nnostrils seems to stand partly in correlation with the enlargement of\r\nthe wattled skin on the upper mandible and over the nostrils; and this\r\nis a character which is selected by fanciers. So again, the broad,\r\nnaked, and wattled skin round the eyes of Carriers and Barbs is a\r\nselected character; and in obvious correlation with this, the eyelids,\r\nmeasured longitudinally, are proportionally more than double the length\r\nof those of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe great difference (see fig. 27) in the curvature of the lower jaw in\r\nthe rock-pigeon, the Tumbler, and Bagadotten Carrier, stands in obvious\r\nrelation to the curvature of the upper jaw, and more especially to the\r\nangle formed by the maxillo-jugal arch with the premaxillary bones. But\r\nin Carriers, Runts, and Barbs the singular reflexion of the upper\r\nmargin of the middle part of the lower jaw (see fig. 25) is not\r\nstrictly correlated with the width or divergence (as may be clearly\r\nseen in fig. 26) of the premaxillary bones, but with the breadth of the\r\nhorny and soft parts of the upper mandible, which are always overlapped\r\nby the edges of the lower mandible.\r\n\r\nIn Pouters, the elongation of the body is a selected character, and the\r\nribs, as we have seen, have generally become very broad, with the\r\nseventh pair furnished with processes; the sacral and caudal vertebræ\r\nhave been augmented in number; the sternum has likewise increased in\r\nlength (but not in the depth of the crest) by ·4 of an inch more than\r\nwould follow from the greater bulk of the body in comparison with that\r\nof the rock-pigeon. In Fantails, the length and number of the caudal\r\nvertebræ have increased. Hence, during the gradual progress of\r\nvariation and selection, the internal bony framework and the external\r\nshape of the body have been, to a certain extent, modified in a\r\ncorrelated manner.\r\n\r\n    Although the wings and tail often vary in length independently of\r\n    each other, it is scarcely possible to doubt that they generally\r\n    tend to become elongated or shortened in correlation. This is well\r\n    seen in Jacobins, and still more plainly in Runts, some varieties\r\n    of which have their wings and tail of great length, whilst others\r\n    have both very short. With Jacobins, the remarkable length of the\r\n    tail and wing-feathers is not a character which is intentionally\r\n    selected by fanciers; but fanciers have been trying for centuries,\r\n    at least since the year 1600, to increase the length of the\r\n    reversed feathers on the neck, so that the hood may more completely\r\n    enclose the head; and it may be suspected that the increased length\r\n    of the wing and tail-feathers stand in correlation with the\r\n    increased length of the neck-feathers. Short-faced Tumblers have\r\n    short wings in nearly due proportion with the reduced size of their\r\n    bodies; but it is remarkable, seeing that the number of the primary\r\n    wing-feathers is a constant character in most birds, that these\r\n    Tumblers generally have only nine instead of ten primaries. I have\r\n    myself observed this in eight birds; and the Original Columbarian\r\n    Society[37] reduced the standard for Bald-head Tumblers from ten to\r\n    nine white flight-feathers, thinking it unfair that a bird which\r\n    had only nine feathers should be disqualified for a prize because\r\n    it had not ten _white_ flight-feathers. On the other hand, in\r\n    Carriers and Runts, which have large bodies and long wings, eleven\r\n    primary feathers have occasionally been observed.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier has informed me of a curious and inexplicable case of\r\ncorrelation, namely, that young pigeons of all breeds which when mature\r\nbecome white, yellow, silver (_i.e.,_ extremely pale blue), or\r\ndun-coloured, are born almost naked; whereas pigeons of other colours\r\nare born well-clothed with down. Mr. Esquilant, however, has observed\r\nthat young dun Carriers are not so bare as young dun Barbs and\r\nTumblers. Mr. Tegetmeier has seen two young birds in the same nest,\r\nproduced from differently coloured parents, which differed greatly in\r\nthe degree to which they were at first clothed with down.\r\n\r\nI have observed another case of correlation which at first sight\r\nappears quite inexplicable, but on which, as we shall see in a future\r\nchapter, some light can be thrown by the law of homologous parts\r\nvarying in the same manner. The case is, that, when the feet are much\r\nfeathered, the roots of the feathers are connected by a web of skin,\r\nand apparently in correlation with this the two outer toes become\r\nconnected for a considerable space by skin. I have observed this in\r\nvery many specimens of Pouters, Trumpeters, Swallows, Roller-tumblers\r\n(likewise observed in this breed by Mr. Brent), and in a lesser degree\r\nin other feather-footed pigeons.\r\n\r\nThe feet of the smaller and larger breeds are of course much smaller or\r\nlarger than those of the rock-pigeon; but the scutellæ or scales\r\ncovering the toes and tarsi have not only decreased or increased in\r\nsize, but likewise in number. To give a single instance, I have counted\r\neight scutellæ on the hind toe of a Runt, and only five on that of a\r\nShort-faced Tumbler. With birds in a state of nature the number of the\r\nscutellæ on the feet is usually a constant character. The length of the\r\nfeet and the length of the beak apparently stand in correlation; but as\r\ndisuse apparently has affected the size of the feet, this case may come\r\nunder the following discussion.\r\n\r\n_On the Effects of Disuse._—In the following discussion on the relative\r\nproportions of the feet, sternum, furculum, scapulæ, and wings, I may\r\npremise, in order to give some confidence to the reader, that all my\r\nmeasurements were made in the same manner, and that they were made\r\nwithout the least intention of applying them to the following purpose.\r\n\r\nTable I.\r\n      _Pigeons with their beaks generally shorter than that of the\r\n      Rock-pigeon, proportionally to the size of their bodies._\r\n\r\nName of Breed.

I measured the feet without the\r\nclaws, from the end of the middle toe to the end of the hind toe; and\r\nthe tarsus and middle toe together. I have taken in every case the mean\r\nmeasurement of two wild rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands, as the\r\nstandard of comparison. The following table shows the actual length of\r\nthe feet in each bird; and the difference between the length which the\r\nfeet ought to have had according to the size of body of each, in\r\ncomparison with the size of body and length of feet of the rock-pigeon,\r\ncalculated (with a few specified exceptions) by the standard of the\r\nlength of the body from the base of the beak to the oil-gland. I have\r\npreferred this standard, owing to the variability of the length of\r\ntail. But I have made similar calculations, taking as the standard the\r\nlength from tip to tip of wing, and likewise in most cases from the\r\nbase of the beak to the end of the tail; and the result has always been\r\nclosely similar. To give an example: the first bird in the table, being\r\na Short-faced Tumbler, is much smaller than the rock-pigeon, and would\r\nnaturally have shorter feet; but it is found on calculation to have\r\nfeet too short by ·11 of an inch, in comparison with the feet of the\r\nrock-pigeon, relatively to the size of the body in these two birds, as\r\nmeasured from the base of beak to the oil-gland. So again, when this\r\nsame Tumbler and the rock-pigeon were compared by the length of their\r\nwings, or by the extreme length of their bodies, the feet of the\r\nTumbler were likewise found to be too short in very nearly the same\r\nproportion. I am well aware that the measurements pretend to greater\r\naccuracy than is possible, but it was less trouble to write down the\r\nactual measurements given by the compasses in each case than an\r\napproximation.\r\n\r\nTable II.\r\n      _Pigeons with their beaks longer than that of the Rock-pigeon,\r\n      proportionally to the size of their bodies._\r\n\r\nName of Breed.

In the first table twenty-two specimens have\r\ntheir feet too short, on an average by a little above the tenth of an\r\ninch (viz. ·107); and five specimens have their feet on an average a\r\nvery little too long, namely, by ·07 of an inch. But some of these\r\nlatter cases can be explained; for instance, with Pouters the legs and\r\nfeet are selected for length, and thus any natural tendency to a\r\ndiminution in the length of the feet will have been counteracted. In\r\nthe Swallow and Barb, when the calculation was made on any standard of\r\ncomparison besides the one used (viz. length of body from base of beak\r\nto oil-gland), the feet were found to be too small.\r\n\r\n    In the second table we have eight birds, with their beaks much\r\n    longer than in the rock-pigeon, both actually and proportionally\r\n    with the size of body, and their feet are in an equally marked\r\n    manner longer, namely, in proportion, on an average by ·29 of an\r\n    inch. I should here state that in Table I there are a few partial\r\n    exceptions to the beak being proportionally shorter than in the\r\n    rock-pigeon: thus the beak of the English Frill-back is just\r\n    perceptibly longer, and that of the Bussorah Carrier of the same\r\n    length or slightly longer, than in the rock-pigeon. The beaks of\r\n    Spots, Swallows, and Laughers are only a very little shorter, or of\r\n    the same proportional length, but slenderer. Nevertheless, these\r\n    two tables, taken conjointly, indicate pretty plainly some kind of\r\n    correlation between the length of the beak and the size of the\r\n    feet. Breeders of cattle and horses believe that there is an\r\n    analogous connection between the length of the limbs and head; they\r\n    assert that a race-horse with the head of a dray-horse, or a\r\n    grey-hound with the head of a bulldog, would be a monstrous\r\n    production. As fancy pigeons are generally kept in small aviaries,\r\n    and are abundantly supplied with food, they must walk about much\r\n    less than the wild rock-pigeon; and it may be admitted as highly\r\n    probable that the reduction in the size of the feet in the\r\n    twenty-two birds in the first table has been caused by disuse,[38]\r\n    and that this reduction has acted by correlation on the beaks of\r\n    the great majority of the birds in Table I. When, on the other\r\n    hand, the beak has been much elongated by the continued selection\r\n    of successive slight increments of length, the feet by correlation\r\n    have likewise become much elongated in comparison with those of the\r\n    wild rock-pigeon, notwithstanding their lessened use.\r\n\r\nAs I had taken measures from the end of the middle toe to the heel of\r\nthe tarsus in the rock-pigeon and in the above thirty-six birds, I have\r\nmade calculations analogous with those above given, and the result is\r\nthe same— namely, that in the short-beaked breeds, with equally few\r\nexceptions as in the former case, the middle toe conjointly with the\r\ntarsus has decreased in length; whereas in the long-beaked breeds it\r\nhas increased in length, though not quite so uniformly as in the former\r\ncase, for the leg, in some varieties of the Runt varies much in length.\r\n\r\nAs fancy pigeons are generally confined in aviaries of moderate size,\r\nand as even when not confined they do not search for their own food,\r\nthey must during many generations have used their wings incomparably\r\nless than the wild rock-pigeon. Hence it seemed to me probable that all\r\nthe parts of the skeleton subservient to flight would be found to be\r\nreduced in size. With respect to the sternum, I have carefully measured\r\nits extreme length in twelve birds of different breeds, and in two wild\r\nrock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands. For the proportional comparison\r\nI have tried three standards of measurement, with all twelve birds\r\nnamely, the length from the base of the beak to the oil-gland, to the\r\nend of the tail, and from the extreme tip to tip of wings. The result\r\nhas been in each case nearly the same, the sternum being invariably\r\nfound to be shorter than in the wild rock-pigeon. I will give only a\r\nsingle table, as calculated by the standard from the base of the beak\r\nto the oil-gland; for the result in this case is nearly the mean\r\nbetween the results obtained by the two other standards.\r\n\r\n_Length of Sternum._\r\n\r\nName of Breed     Actual\r\n          Length.\r\n          Inches     Too\r\n          short by Wild Rock-pigeon     2·55     — Wild\r\n          Rock-pigeon     2·55     — Pied Scanderoon     2·80     0·60\r\n          Bagadotten Carrier     2·80     0·17 Dragon     2·45     0·41\r\n          Carrier     2·75     0·35 Short-faced Tumbler     2·05     0·28\r\n          Barb     2·35     0·34 Nun     2·27     0·15 German\r\n          Pouter     2·36     0·54 Jacobin     2·33     0·22 English\r\n          Frill-back     2·40     0·43 Swallow     2·45     0·17\r\n\r\nThis table shows that in these twelve breeds the sternum is of an\r\naverage one-third of an inch (exactly ·332) shorter than in the\r\nrock-pigeon, proportionally with the size of their bodies; so that the\r\nsternum has been reduced by between one-seventh and one-eighth of its\r\nentire length; and this is a considerable reduction.\r\n\r\nI have also measured in twenty-one birds, including the above dozen,\r\nthe prominence of the crest of the sternum relatively to its length,\r\nindependently of the size of the body. In two of the twenty-one birds\r\nthe crest was prominent in the same relative degree as in the\r\nrock-pigeon; in seven it was more prominent; but in five out of these\r\nseven, namely, in a Fantail, two Scanderoons, and two English Carriers,\r\nthis greater prominence may to a certain extent be explained, as a\r\nprominent breast is admired and selected by fanciers; in the remaining\r\ntwelve birds the prominence was less. Hence it follows that the crest\r\nexhibits a slight, though uncertain, tendency to be reduced in\r\nprominence in a greater degree than does the length of the sternum\r\nrelatively to the size of body, in comparison with the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nI have measured the length of the scapula in nine different large and\r\nsmall-sized breeds, and in all the scapula is proportionally shorter\r\n(taking the same standard as before) than in the wild rock-pigeon. The\r\nreduction in length on an average is very nearly one-fifth of an inch,\r\nor about one-ninth of the length of the scapula in the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the furcula in all the specimens which I compared, diverged\r\nless, proportionally with the size of body, than in the rock-pigeon;\r\nand the whole furculum was proportionally shorter. Thus in a Runt,\r\nwhich measured from tip to tip of wings 38½ inches, the furculum was\r\nonly a very little longer (with the arms hardly more divergent) than in\r\na rock-pigeon which measured from tip to tip 26½ inches. In a Barb,\r\nwhich in all its measurements was a little larger than the same\r\nrock-pigeon, the furculum was a quarter of an inch shorter. In a\r\nPouter, the furculum had not been lengthened proportionally with the\r\nincreased length of the body. In a Short-faced Tumbler, which measured\r\nfrom tip to tip of wings 24 inches, therefore only 2½ inches less than\r\nthe rock-pigeon, the furculum was barely two-thirds of the length of\r\nthat of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    We thus clearly see that the sternum, scapula, and furculum are all\r\n    reduced in proportional length; but when we turn to the wings we\r\n    find what at first appears a wholly different and unexpected\r\n    result. I may here remark that I have not picked out specimens, but\r\n    have used every measurement made by me. Taking the length from the\r\n    base of beak to the end of the tail as the standard of comparison,\r\n    I find that, out of thirty-five birds of various breeds,\r\n    twenty-five have wings of greater, and ten have them of less\r\n    proportional length, than in the rock-pigeon. But from the\r\n    frequently correlated length of the tail and wing-feathers, it is\r\n    better to take as the standard of comparison the length from the\r\n    base of the beak to the oil-gland; and by this standard, out of\r\n    twenty-six of the same birds which had been thus measured,\r\n    twenty-one had wings too long, and only five had them too short. In\r\n    the twenty-one birds the wings exceeded in length those of the\r\n    rock-pigeon, on an average, by 1-1/3 inch; whilst in the five birds\r\n    they were less in length by only ·8 of an inch. As I was much\r\n    surprised that the wings of closely confined birds should thus so\r\n    frequently have been increased in length, it occurred to me that it\r\n    might be solely due to the greater length of the wing-feathers; for\r\n    this certainly is the case with the Jacobin, which has wings of\r\n    unusual length. As in almost every case I had measured the folded\r\n    wings, I subtracted the length of this terminal part from that of\r\n    the expanded wings, and thus I obtained, with a moderate degree of\r\n    accuracy, the length of the wings from the ends of the two radii,\r\n    answering from wrist to wrist in our arms. The wings, thus measured\r\n    in the same twenty-five birds, now gave a widely different result;\r\n    for they were proportionally with those of the rock-pigeon too\r\n    short in seventeen birds, and in only eight too long. Of these\r\n    eight birds, five were long-beaked,[39] and this fact perhaps\r\n    indicates that there is some correlation of the length of the beak\r\n    with the length of the bones of the wings, in the same manner as\r\n    with that of the feet and tarsi. The shortening of the humerus and\r\n    radius in the seventeen birds may probably be attributed to disuse,\r\n    as in the case of the scapula and furculum to which the wing-bones\r\n    are attached;—the lengthening of the wing-feathers, and\r\n    consequently the expansion of the wings from tip to tip, being, on\r\n    the other hand, as completely independent of use and disuse as is\r\n    the growth of the hair or wool on our long-haired dogs or\r\n    long-woolled sheep.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: we may confidently admit that the length of the sternum, and\r\nfrequently the prominence of its crest, the length of the scapula and\r\nfurculum, have all been reduced in size in comparison with the same\r\nparts in the rock-pigeon. And I presume that this may be attributed to\r\ndisuse or lessened exercise. The wings, as measured from the ends of\r\nthe radii, have likewise been generally reduced in length; but, owing\r\nto the increased growth of the wing-feathers, the wings, from tip to\r\ntip, are commonly longer than in the rock-pigeon. The feet, as well as\r\nthe tarsi conjointly with the middle toe, have likewise in most cases\r\nbecome reduced; and this it is probable has been caused by their\r\nlessened use; but the existence of some sort of correlation between the\r\nfeet and beak is shown more plainly than the effects of disuse. We have\r\nalso some faint indication of a similar correlation between the main\r\nbones of the wing and the beak.\r\n\r\n_Summary on the Points of Difference between the several Domestic\r\nRaces, and between the individual Birds._—The beak, together with the\r\nbones of the face, differ remarkably in length, breadth, shape, and\r\ncurvature. The skull differs in shape, and greatly in the angle formed\r\nby the union of the pre-maxillary, nasal, and maxillo-jugal bones. The\r\ncurvature of the lower jaw and the reflection of its upper margin, as\r\nwell as the gape of the mouth, differ in a highly remarkable manner.\r\nThe tongue varies much in length, both independently and in correlation\r\nwith the length of the beak. The development of the naked, wattled skin\r\nover the nostrils and round the eyes varies in an extreme degree. The\r\neyelids and the external orifices of the nostrils vary in length, and\r\nare to a certain extent correlated with the degree of development of\r\nthe wattle. The size and form of the œsophagus and crop, and their\r\ncapacity for inflation, differ immensely. The length of the neck\r\nvaries. With the varying shape of the body, the breadth and number of\r\nthe ribs, the presence of processes, the number of the sacral vertebræ,\r\nand the length of the sternum, all vary. The number and size of the\r\ncoccygeal vertebræ vary, apparently in correlation with the increased\r\nsize of the tail. The size and shape of the perforations in the\r\nsternum, and the size and divergence of the arms of the furculum,\r\ndiffer. The oil-gland varies in development, and is sometimes quite\r\naborted. The direction and length of certain feathers have been much\r\nmodified, as in the hood of the Jacobin and the frill of the Turbit.\r\nThe wing and tail-feathers generally vary in length together, but\r\nsometimes independently of each other and of the size of the body. The\r\nnumber and position of the tail-feather vary to an unparalleled degree.\r\nThe primary and secondary wing-feathers occasionally vary in number,\r\napparently in correlation with the length of the wing. The length of\r\nthe leg and the size of the feet, and, in connection with the latter,\r\nthe number of the scutellæ, all vary. A web of skin sometimes connects\r\nthe bases of the two inner toes, and almost invariably the two outer\r\ntoes when the feet are feathered.\r\n\r\n    The size of the body differs greatly: a Runt has been known to\r\n    weigh more than five times as much as a Short-faced Tumbler. The\r\n    eggs differ in size and shape. According to Parmentier,[40] some\r\n    races use much straw in building their nests, and others use\r\n    little; but I cannot hear of any recent corroboration of this\r\n    statement. The length of time required for hatching the eggs is\r\n    uniform in all the breeds. The period at which the characteristic\r\n    plumage of some breeds is acquired, and at which certain changes of\r\n    colour supervene, differs. The degree to which the young birds are\r\n    clothed with down when first hatched is different, and is\r\n    correlated in a singular manner with the colour of the plumage. The\r\n    manner of flight, and certain inherited movements, such as clapping\r\n    the wings, tumbling either in the air or on the ground, and the\r\n    manner of courting the female, present the most singular\r\n    differences. In disposition the several races differ. Some races\r\n    are very silent; others coo in a highly peculiar manner.\r\n\r\n    Although many different races have kept true in character during\r\n    several centuries, as we shall hereafter more fully see, yet there\r\n    is far more individual variability in the most constant breeds than\r\n    in birds in a state of nature. There is hardly any exception to the\r\n    rule that those characters vary most which are now most valued and\r\n    attended to by fanciers, and which consequently are now being\r\n    improved by continued selection. This is indirectly admitted by\r\n    fanciers when they complain that it is much more difficult to breed\r\n    high fancy pigeons up to the proper standard of excellence than the\r\n    so-called toy pigeons, which differ from each other merely in\r\n    colour; for particular colours when once acquired are not liable to\r\n    continued improvement or augmentation. Some characters become\r\n    attached, from quite unknown causes, more strongly to the male than\r\n    to the female sex; so that we have in certain races, a tendency\r\n    towards the appearance of secondary sexual characters,[41] of which\r\n    the aboriginal rock-pigeon displays not a trace.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] The Hon.

I have given in my\r\n ‘Descent of Man’ (6th edit. p. 466) some curious cases, on the\r\n authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, of silver-coloured (_i.e._ very pale\r\n blue) birds being generally females, and of the ease with which a race\r\n thus characterised could be produced. Bonizzi (_see_ ‘Variazioni dei\r\n Columbi domestici:’ Padova, 1873) states that certain coloured spots\r\n are often different in the two sexes, and the certain tints are\r\n commoner in females than in male pigeons.\r\n\r\n [35] Prof. A. Newton (‘Proc. Zoolog. Soc.,’ 1865, p. 716) remarks that\r\n he knows no species which present any remarkable sexual distinction;\r\n but Mr. Wallace informs me, that in the sub-family of the Treronidæ\r\n the sexes often differ considerably in colour. _See also_ on sexual\r\n differences in the Columbidæ, Gould, ‘Handbook to the Birds of\r\n Australia,’ vol. ii., pp. 109-149.\r\n\r\n [36] I am not sure that I have designated the different kinds of\r\n vertebræ correctly: but I observe that different anatomists follow in\r\n this respect different rules, and, as I use the same terms in the\r\n comparison of all the skeletons, this, I hope, will not signify.\r\n\r\n [37] J. M. Eaton’s ‘Treatise,’ edit. 1858, p. 78.\r\n\r\n [38] In an analogous, but converse, manner, certain natural groups of\r\n the Columbidæ, from being more terrestrial in their habits than other\r\n allied groups, have larger feet. _See_ Prince Bonaparte’s ‘Coup d’œil\r\n sur l’Ordre des Pigeons.’\r\n\r\n [39] It perhaps deserves notice that besides these five birds two of\r\n the eight were Barbs, which, as I have shown, must be classed in the\r\n same group with the long-beaked Carriers and Runts. Barbs may properly\r\n be called short-beaked Carriers. It would, therefore, appear as if,\r\n during the reduction of their beaks, their wings had retained a little\r\n of that excess of length which is characteristic of their nearest\r\n relations and progenitors.\r\n\r\n [40] Temminck, ‘Hist.

PIGEONS—_continued._\r\n\r\nON THE ABORIGINAL PARENT-STOCK OF THE SEVERAL DOMESTIC RACES—HABITS OF\r\nLIFE—WILD RACES OF THE ROCK-PIGEON—Dovecot-PIGEONS—PROOFS OF THE\r\nDESCENT OF THE SEVERAL RACES FROM COLUMBA LIVIA—FERTILITY OF THE RACES\r\nWHEN CROSSED—REVERSION TO THE PLUMAGE OF THE WILD\r\nROCK-PIGEON—CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO THE FORMATION OF THE\r\nRACES—ANTIQUITY AND HISTORY OF THE PRINCIPAL RACES—MANNER OF THEIR\r\nFORMATION—SELECTION—UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION—CARE TAKEN BY FANCIERS IN\r\nSELECTING THEIR BIRDS—SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STRAINS GRADUALLY CHANGE INTO\r\nWELL-MARKED BREEDS—EXTINCTION OF INTERMEDIATE FORMS—CERTAIN BREEDS\r\nREMAIN PERMANENT, WHILST OTHERS CHANGE—SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe differences described in the last chapter between the eleven chief\r\ndomestic races and between individual birds of the same race, would be\r\nof little significance, if they had not all descended from a single\r\nwild stock. The question of their origin is therefore of fundamental\r\nimportance, and must be discussed at considerable length. No one will\r\nthink this superfluous who considers the great amount of difference\r\nbetween the races, who knows how ancient many of them are, and how\r\ntruly they breed at the present day. Fanciers almost unanimously\r\nbelieve that the different races are descended from several wild\r\nstocks, whereas most naturalists believe that all are descended from\r\nthe Columba livia or rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    Temminck[1] has well observed, and Mr. Gould has made the same\r\n    remark to me, that the aboriginal parent must have been a species\r\n    which roosted and built its nest on rocks; and I may add that it\r\n    must have been a social bird. For all the domestic races are highly\r\n    social, and none are known to build or habitually to roost on\r\n    trees. The awkward manner in which some pigeons, kept by me in a\r\n    summer-house near an old walnut-tree, occasionally alighted on the\r\n    barer branches, was evident.[2] Nevertheless, Mr. R. Scot Skirving\r\n    informs me that he often saw crowds of pigeons in Upper Egypt\r\n    settling on low trees, but not on palms, in preference to alighting\r\n    on the mud hovels of the natives. In India Mr. Blyth[3] has been\r\n    assured that the wild _C. livia,_ var. _intermedia,_ sometimes\r\n    roosts in trees. I may here give a curious instance of compulsion\r\n    leading to changed habits: the banks of the Nile above lat. 28° 30′\r\n    are perpendicular for a long distance, so that when the river is\r\n    full the pigeons cannot alight on the shore to drink, and Mr.\r\n    Skirving repeatedly saw whole flocks settle on the water, and drink\r\n    whilst they floated down the stream. These flocks seen from a\r\n    distance resembled flocks of gulls on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n    If any domestic race had descended from a species which was not\r\n    social, or which built its nest and roosted in trees,[4] the sharp\r\n    eyes of fanciers would assuredly have detected some vestige of so\r\n    different an aboriginal habit. For we have reason to believe that\r\n    aboriginal habits are long retained under domestication. Thus with\r\n    the common ass we see signs of its original desert life in its\r\n    strong dislike to cross the smallest stream of water, and in its\r\n    pleasure in rolling in the dust. The same strong dislike to cross a\r\n    stream is common to the camel, which has been domesticated from a\r\n    very ancient period. Young pigs, though so tame, sometimes squat\r\n    when frightened, and thus try to conceal themselves even on an open\r\n    and bare place. Young turkeys, and occasionally even young fowls,\r\n    when the hen gives the danger-cry, run away and try to hide\r\n    themselves, like young partridges or pheasants, in order that their\r\n    mother may take flight, of which she has lost the power. The\r\n    musk-duck (_Cairina moschata_) in its native country often perches\r\n    and roosts on trees,[5] and our domesticated musk-ducks, though\r\n    such sluggish birds, “are fond of perching on the tops of barns,\r\n    walls, etc., and, if allowed to spend the night in the hen-house,\r\n    the female will generally go to roost by the side of the hens, but\r\n    the drake is too heavy to mount thither with ease.”[6] We know that\r\n    the dog, however well and regularly fed, often buries, like the\r\n    fox, any superfluous food; and we see him turning round and round\r\n    on a carpet, as if to trample down grass to form a bed; we see him\r\n    on bare pavements scratching backwards as if to throw earth over\r\n    his excrement, although, as I believe, this is never effected even\r\n    where there is earth. In the delight with which lambs and kids\r\n    crowd together and frisk on the smallest hillock, we see a vestige\r\n    of their former alpine habits.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore good reason to believe that all the domestic races of\r\nthe pigeon are descended either from some one or from several species\r\nwhich both roosted and built their nests on rocks, and were social in\r\ndisposition. As only five or six wild species have these habits, and\r\nmake any near approach in structure to the domesticated pigeon, I will\r\nenumerate them.\r\n\r\n    Firstly, the _Columba leuconota_ resembles certain domestic\r\n    varieties in its plumage, with the one marked and never-failing\r\n    difference of a white band which crosses the tail at some distance\r\n    from the extremity. This species, moreover, inhabits the Himalaya,\r\n    close to the limit of perpetual snow; and therefore, as Mr. Blyth\r\n    has remarked, is not likely to have been the parent of our domestic\r\n    breeds, which thrive in the hottest countries. Secondly, the _C.\r\n    rupestris,_ of Central Asia, which is intermediate[7] between the\r\n    _C. leuconota_ and _livia_; but has nearly the same coloured tail\r\n    as the former species. Thirdly, the _ Columba littoralis_ builds\r\n    and roosts, according to Temminck, on rocks in the Malayan\r\n    archipelago; it is white, excepting parts of the wing and the tip\r\n    of the tail, which are black; its legs are livid-coloured, and this\r\n    is a character not observed in any adult domestic pigeon; but I\r\n    need not have mentioned this species or the closely-allied _C.\r\n    luctuosa,_ as they in fact belong to the genus Carpophaga.\r\n    Fourthly, _Columba guinea,_ which ranges from Guinea[8] to the Cape\r\n    of Good Hope, and roosts either on trees or rocks, according to the\r\n    nature of the country. This species belongs to the genus\r\n    Strictoenas of Reichenbach, but is closely allied to Columba; it is\r\n    to some extent coloured like certain domestic races, and has been\r\n    said to be domesticated in Abyssinia; but Mr. Mansfield Parkyns,\r\n    who collected the birds of that country and knows the species,\r\n    informs me that this is a mistake. Moreover, the _C. guinea_ is\r\n    characterised by the feathers of the neck having peculiar notched\r\n    tips,—a character not observed in any domestic race. Fifthly, the _\r\n    Columba œnas_ of Europe, which roosts on trees, and builds its nest\r\n    in holes, either in trees or the ground; this species, as far as\r\n    external characters go, might be the parent of several domestic\r\n    races; but, though it crosses readily with the true rock-pigeon,\r\n    the offspring, as we shall presently see, are sterile hybrids, and\r\n    of such sterility there is not a trace when the domestic races are\r\n    intercrossed. It should also be observed that if we were to admit,\r\n    against all probability, that any of the foregoing five or six\r\n    species were the parents of some of our domestic pigeons, not the\r\n    least light would be thrown on the chief differences between the\r\n    eleven most strongly-marked races.\r\n\r\n    We now come to the best known rock-pigeon, the _Columba livia,_\r\n    which is often designated in Europe pre-eminently as the\r\n    Rock-pigeon, and which naturalists believe to be the parent of all\r\n    the domesticated breeds. This bird agrees in every essential\r\n    character with the breeds which have been only slightly modified.\r\n    It differs from all other species in being of a slaty-blue colour,\r\n    with two black bars on the wings, and with the croup (or loins)\r\n    white. Occasionally birds are seen in Faroe and the Hebrides with\r\n    the black bars replaced by two or three black spots; this form has\r\n    been named by Brehm[9] _C. amaliæ,_ but this species has not been\r\n    admitted as distinct by other ornithologists. Graba[10] even found\r\n    a difference in the bars on the right and left wings of the same\r\n    bird in Faroe. Another and rather more distinct form is either\r\n    truly wild or has become feral on the cliffs of England and was\r\n    doubtfully named by Mr. Blyth[11] as _C. affinis,_ but is now no\r\n    longer considered by him as a distinct species. _C. affinis_ is\r\n    rather smaller than the rock-pigeon of the Scottish islands, and\r\n    has a very different appearance owing to the wing-coverts being\r\n    chequered with black, with similar marks often extending over the\r\n    back. The chequering consists of a large black spot on the two\r\n    sides, but chiefly on the outer side, of each feather. The\r\n    wing-bars in the true rock-pigeon and in the chequered variety are,\r\n    in fact, due to similar though larger spots symmetrically crossing\r\n    the secondary wing-feather and the larger coverts. Hence the\r\n    chequering arises merely from an extension of these marks to other\r\n    parts of the plumage. Chequered birds are not confined to the\r\n    coasts of England; for they were found by Graba at Faroe; and W.\r\n    Thompson[12] says that at Islay fully half the wild rock-pigeons\r\n    were chequered. Colonel King, of Hythe, stocked his dovecot with\r\n    young wild birds which he himself procured from nests at the Orkney\r\n    Islands; and several specimens, kindly sent to me by him, were all\r\n    plainly chequered. As we thus see that chequered birds occur\r\n    mingled with the true rock-pigeon at three distinct sites, namely,\r\n    Faroe, the Orkney Islands, and Islay, no importance can be attached\r\n    to this natural variation in the plumage.\r\n\r\n    Prince C. L. Bonaparte,[13] a great divider of species, enumerates,\r\n    with a mark of interrogation, as distinct from _C. livia,_ the _C.\r\n    turricola_ of Italy, the _C. rupestris_ of Daouria, and the _C.\r\n    schimperi_ of Abyssinia; but these birds differ from _C. livia_ in\r\n    characters of the most trifling value. In the British Museum there\r\n    is a chequered pigeon, probably the _C. schimperi_ of Bonaparte,\r\n    from Abyssinia. To these may be added the _C. gymnocyclus_ of G. R.\r\n    Gray from W. Africa, which is slightly more distinct, and has\r\n    rather more naked skin round the eyes than the rock-pigeon; but\r\n    from information given me by Dr. Daniell, it is doubtful whether\r\n    this is a wild bird, for dovecot-pigeons (which I have examined)\r\n    are kept on the coast of Guinea.\r\n\r\n    The wild rock-pigeon of India (_C. intermedia_ of Strickland) has\r\n    been more generally accepted as a distinct species. It differs\r\n    chiefly in the croup being blue instead of snow-white; but as Mr.\r\n    Blyth informs me, the tint varies, being sometimes albescent. When\r\n    this form is domesticated chequered birds appear, just as occurs in\r\n    Europe with the truly wild _C. livia._ Moreover we shall\r\n    immediately have proof that the blue and white croup is a highly\r\n    variable character; and Bechstein[14] asserts that with\r\n    dovecot-pigeons in Germany this is the most variable of all the\r\n    characters of the plumage. Hence it may be concluded that _C.\r\n    intermedia_ cannot be ranked as specifically distinct from _C.\r\n    livia._\r\n\r\nIn Madeira there is a rock-pigeon which a few ornithologists have\r\nsuspected to be distinct from _C. livia._ I have examined numerous\r\nspecimens collected by Mr. E. V. Harcourt and Mr. Mason. They are\r\nrather smaller than the rock- pigeon from the Shetland Islands, and\r\ntheir beaks are plainly thinner, but the thickness of the beak varied\r\nin the several specimens. In plumage there is remarkable diversity;\r\nsome specimens are identical in every feather (I speak after actual\r\ncomparison) with the rock-pigeon of the Shetland Islands; others are\r\nchequered, like _C. affinis_ from the cliffs of England, but generally\r\nto a greater degree, being almost black over the whole back; others are\r\nidentical with the so-called _C. intermedia_ of India in the degree of\r\nblueness of the croup; whilst others have this part very pale or very\r\ndark blue, and are likewise chequered. So much variability raises a\r\nstrong suspicion that these birds are domestic pigeons which have\r\nbecome feral.\r\n\r\n    From these facts it can hardly be doubted that _C. livia, affinis,\r\n    intermedia,_ and the forms marked with an interrogation by\r\n    Bonaparte ought all to be included under a single species. But it\r\n    is quite immaterial whether or not they are thus ranked, and\r\n    whether some one of these forms or all are the progenitors of the\r\n    various domestic kinds, as far as any light can thus be thrown on\r\n    the differences between the more strongly-marked races. That common\r\n    dovecot-pigeons, which are kept in various parts of the world, are\r\n    descended from one or from several of the above-mentioned wild\r\n    varieties of _C. livia,_ no one who compares them will doubt. But\r\n    before making a few remarks on dovecot-pigeons, it should be stated\r\n    that the wild rock-pigeon has been found easy to tame in several\r\n    countries. We have seen that Colonel King at Hythe stocked his\r\n    dovecot more than twenty years ago with young wild birds taken at\r\n    the Orkney Islands, and since then they have greatly multiplied.\r\n    The accurate Macgillivray[15] asserts that he completely tamed a\r\n    wild rock-pigeon in the Hebrides; and several accounts are on\r\n    records of these pigeons having bred in dovecots in the Shetland\r\n    Islands. In India, as Captain Hutton informs me, the wild\r\n    rock-pigeon is easily tamed, and breeds readily with the domestic\r\n    kind; and Mr. Blyth[16] asserts that wild birds come frequently to\r\n    the dovecots and mingle freely with their inhabitants. In the\r\n    ancient ‘Ayeen Akbery’ it is written that, if a few wild pigeons be\r\n    taken, “they are speedily joined by a thousand others of their\r\n    kind.”\r\n\r\n    Dovecot-pigeons are those which are kept in dovecots in a semi-\r\n    domesticated state; for no special care is taken of them, and they\r\n    procure their own food, except during the severest weather. In\r\n    England, and, judging from MM. Boitard and Corbié’s work, in\r\n    France, the common dovecot- pigeon exactly resembles the chequered\r\n    variety of _C. livia;_ but I have seen dovecots brought from\r\n    Yorkshire without any trace of chequering, like the wild\r\n    rock-pigeon of the Shetland Islands. The chequered dovecots from\r\n    the Orkney Islands, after having been domesticated by Colonel King\r\n    for more than twenty years, differed slightly from each other in\r\n    the darkness of their plumage and in the thickness of their beaks;\r\n    the thinnest beak being rather thicker than the thickest one in the\r\n    Madeira birds. In Germany, according to Bechstein, the common\r\n    dovecot-pigeon is not chequered. In India they often become\r\n    chequered, and sometimes pied with white; the croup also, as I am\r\n    informed by Mr. Blyth, becomes nearly white. I have received from\r\n    Sir. J. Brooke some dovecot-pigeons, which originally came from the\r\n    S. Natunas Islands in the Malay Archipelago, and which had been\r\n    crossed with the Singapore dovecots: they were small and the\r\n    darkest variety was extremely like the dark chequered variety with\r\n    a blue croup from Madeira; but the beak was not so thin, though\r\n    decidedly thinner than in the rock- pigeon from the Shetland\r\n    Islands. A dovecot-pigeon sent to me by Mr. Swinhoe from Foochow,\r\n    in China, was likewise rather small, but differed in no other\r\n    respect. I have also received through the kindness of Dr. Daniell,\r\n    four living dovecot-pigeons from Sierra Leone,[17] these were fully\r\n    as large as the Shetland rock-pigeon, with even bulkier bodies. In\r\n    plumage some of them were identical with the Shetland rock pigeon,\r\n    but with the metallic tints apparently rather more brilliant;\r\n    others had a blue croup, and resembled the chequered variety of _C.\r\n    intermedia_ of India; and some were so much chequered as to be\r\n    nearly black. In these four birds the beak differed slightly in\r\n    length, but in all it was decidedly shorter, more massive, and\r\n    stronger than in the wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands, or\r\n    in the English dovecot. When the beaks of these African pigeons\r\n    were compared with the thinnest beaks of the wild Madeira\r\n    specimens, the contrast was great; the former being fully one-third\r\n    thicker in a vertical direction than the latter; so that any one at\r\n    first would have felt inclined to rank these birds as specifically\r\n    distinct; yet so perfectly graduated a series could be formed\r\n    between the above-mentioned varieties, that it was obviously\r\n    impossible to separate them.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the wild _Columba livia,_ including under this name _C.\r\naffinis, intermedia,_ and the other still more closely-affined\r\ngeographical races, has a vast range from the southern coast of Norway\r\nand the Faroe Islands to the shores of the Mediterranean, to Madeira\r\nand the Canary Islands, to Abyssinia, India, and Japan. It varies\r\ngreatly in plumage, being in many places chequered with black, and\r\nhaving either a white or blue croup or loins; it varies also slightly\r\nin the size of the beak and body. Dovecot-pigeons, which no one\r\ndisputes are descended from one or more of the above wild forms,\r\npresent a similar but greater range of variation in plumage, in the\r\nsize of body, and in the length and thickness of the beak. There seems\r\nto be some relation between the croup being blue or white, and the\r\ntemperature of the country inhabited by both wild and dovecot pigeons;\r\nfor nearly all the dovecot-pigeons in the northern parts of Europe have\r\na white croup, like that of the wild European rock-pigeon; and nearly\r\nall the dovecot-pigeons of India have a blue croup like that of the\r\nwild _C. intermedia_ of India. As in various countries the wild\r\nrock-pigeon has been found easy to tame, it seems extremely probable\r\nthat the dovecot-pigeons throughout the world are the descendants of at\r\nleast two and perhaps more wild stocks; but these, as we have just\r\nseen, cannot be ranked as specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the variation of _C. livia,_ we may without fear of\r\ncontradiction go one step further. Those pigeon-fanciers who believe\r\nthat all the chief races, such as Carriers, Pouters, Fantails, etc.,\r\nare descended from distinct aboriginal stocks, yet admit that the\r\nso-called toy-pigeons, which differ from the rock-pigeon in little\r\nexcept colour, are descended from this bird. By toy-pigeons are meant\r\nsuch birds as Spots, Nuns, Helmets, Swallows, Priests, Monks,\r\nPorcelains, Swabians, Archangels, Breasts, Shields, and others in\r\nEurope, and many others in India. It would indeed be as puerile to\r\nsuppose that all these birds are descended from so many distinct wild\r\nstocks as to suppose this to be the case with the many varieties of the\r\ngooseberry, heartsease, or dahlia. Yet these kinds all breed true, and\r\nmany of them include sub-varieties which likewise transmit their\r\ncharacter truly. They differ greatly from each other and from the\r\nrock-pigeon in plumage, slightly in size and proportions of body, in\r\nsize of feet, and in the length and thickness of their beaks. They\r\ndiffer from each other in these respects more than do dovecot-pigeons.\r\nAlthough we may safely admit that dovecot-pigeons, which vary slightly,\r\nand that toy- pigeons, which vary in a greater degree in accordance\r\nwith their more highly-domesticated condition, are descended from _C.\r\nlivia,_ including under this name the above-enumerated wild\r\ngeographical races; yet the question becomes far more difficult when we\r\nconsider the eleven principal races, most of which have been profoundly\r\nmodified. It can, however, be shown, by indirect evidence of a\r\nperfectly conclusive nature, that these principal races are not\r\ndescended from so many wild stocks; and if this be once admitted, few\r\nwill dispute that they are the descendants of _C. livia,_ which agrees\r\nwith them so closely in habits and in most characters, which varies in\r\na state of nature, and which has certainly undergone a considerable\r\namount of variation, as in the toy-pigeons. We shall moreover presently\r\nsee how eminently favourable circumstances have been for a great amount\r\nof modification in the more carefully tended breeds.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for concluding that the several principal races are not\r\ndescended from so many aboriginal and unknown stocks may be grouped\r\nunder the following six heads:—\r\n\r\n_Firstly._—If the eleven chief races have not arisen from the variation\r\nof some one species, together with its geographical races, they must be\r\ndescended from several extremely distinct aboriginal species; for no\r\namount of crossing between only six or seven wild forms could produce\r\nraces so distinct as Pouters, Carriers, Runts, Fantails, Turbits,\r\nShort-faced Tumblers, Jacobins, and Trumpeters. How could crossing\r\nproduce, for instance, a Pouter or a Fantail, unless the two supposed\r\naboriginal parents possessed the remarkable characters of these breeds?\r\nI am aware that some naturalists, following Pallas, believe that\r\ncrossing gives a strong tendency to variation, independently of the\r\ncharacters inherited from either parent. They believe that it would be\r\neasier to raise a Pouter or Fantail pigeon from crossing two distinct\r\nspecies, neither of which possessed the characters of these races, than\r\nfrom any single species. I can find few facts in support of this\r\ndoctrine, and believe in it only to a limited degree; but in a future\r\nchapter I shall have to recur to this subject. For our present purpose\r\nthe point is not material. The question which concerns us is, whether\r\nor not many new and important characters have arisen since man first\r\ndomesticated the pigeon. On the ordinary view, variability is due to\r\nchanged conditions of life; on the Pallasian doctrine, variability, or\r\nthe appearance of new characters, is due to some mysterious effect from\r\nthe crossing of two species, neither of which possesses the characters\r\nin question. In some few instances it is possible that well-marked\r\nraces may have been formed by crossing; for instance, a Barb might\r\nperhaps be formed by a cross between a long-beaked Carrier, having\r\nlarge eye-wattles, and some short-beaked pigeon. That many races have\r\nbeen in some degree modified by crossing, and that certain varieties\r\nwhich are distinguished only by peculiar tints have arisen from crosses\r\nbetween differently-coloured varieties, is almost certain. On the\r\ndoctrine, therefore, that the chief races owe their differences to\r\ntheir descent from distinct species, we must admit that at least eight\r\nor nine, or more probably a dozen species, all having the same habit of\r\nbreeding and roosting on rocks and living in society, either now exist\r\nsomewhere, or formerly existed, but have become extinct as wild birds.\r\nConsidering how carefully wild pigeons have been collected throughout\r\nthe world, and what conspicuous birds they are, especially when\r\nfrequenting rocks, it is extremely improbable that eight or nine\r\nspecies, which were long ago domesticated and therefore must have\r\ninhabited some anciently known country, should still exist in the wild\r\nstate and be unknown to ornithologists.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that such species formerly existed, but have become\r\nextinct, is in some slight degree more probable. But the extinction of\r\nso many species within the historical period is a bold hypothesis,\r\nseeing how little influence man has had in exterminating the common\r\nrock-pigeon, which agrees in all its habits of life with the domestic\r\nraces. The _C. livia_ now exists and flourishes on the small northern\r\nislands of Faroe, on many islands off the coast of Scotland, on\r\nSardinia, and the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the centre of\r\nIndia. Fanciers have sometimes imagined that the several supposed\r\nparent-species were originally confined to small islands, and thus\r\nmight readily have been exterminated; but the facts just given do not\r\nfavour the probability of their extinction, even on small islands. Nor\r\nis it probable, from what is known of the distribution of birds, that\r\nthe islands near Europe should have been inhabited by peculiar species\r\nof pigeons; and if we assume that distant oceanic islands were the\r\nhomes of the supposed parent-species, we must remember that ancient\r\nvoyages were tediously slow, and that ships were then ill-provided with\r\nfresh food, so that it would not have been easy to bring home living\r\nbirds. I have said ancient voyages, for nearly all the races of the\r\npigeon were known before the year 1600, so that the supposed wild\r\nspecies must have been captured and domesticated before that date.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._—The doctrine that the chief domestic races are descended\r\nfrom several aboriginal species, implies that several species were\r\nformerly so thoroughly domesticated as to breed readily when confined.\r\nAlthough it is easy to tame most wild birds, experience shows us that\r\nit is difficult to get them to breed freely under confinement; although\r\nit must be owned that this is less difficult with pigeons than with\r\nmost other birds. During the last two or three hundred years, many\r\nbirds have been kept in aviaries, but hardly one has been added to our\r\nlist of thoroughly reclaimed species: yet on the above doctrine we must\r\nadmit that in ancient times nearly a dozen kinds of pigeons, now\r\nunknown in the wild state, were thoroughly domesticated.\r\n\r\n    _Thirdly._—Most of our domesticated animals have run wild in\r\n    various parts of the world; but birds, owing apparently to their\r\n    partial loss of the power of flight, less often than quadrupeds.\r\n    Nevertheless I have met with accounts showing that the common fowl\r\n    has become feral in South America and perhaps in West Africa, and\r\n    on several islands: the turkey was at one time almost feral on the\r\n    banks of the Parana; and the Guinea-fowl has become perfectly wild\r\n    at Ascension and in Jamaica. In this latter island the peacock,\r\n    also, “has become a maroon bird.” The common duck wanders from its\r\n    home and becomes almost wild in Norfolk. Hybrids between the common\r\n    and musk-duck which have become wild have been shot in North\r\n    America, Belgium, and near the Caspian Sea. The goose is said to\r\n    have run wild in La Plata. The common dovecot-pigeon has become\r\n    wild at Juan Fernandez, Norfolk Island, Ascension, probably at\r\n    Madeira, on the shores of Scotland, and, as is asserted, on the\r\n    banks of the Hudson in North America.[18] But how different is the\r\n    case, when we turn to the eleven chief domestic races of the\r\n    pigeon, which are supposed by some authors to be descended from so\r\n    many distinct species! no one has ever pretended that any one of\r\n    these races has been found wild in any quarter of the world; yet\r\n    they have been transported to all countries, and some of them must\r\n    have been carried back to their native homes. On the view that all\r\n    the races are the product of variation, we can understand why they\r\n    have not become feral, for the great amount of modification which\r\n    they have undergone shows how long and how thoroughly they have\r\n    been domesticated; and this would unfit them for a wild life.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._—If it be assumed that the characteristic differences\r\nbetween the various domestic races are due to descent from several\r\naboriginal species, we must conclude that man chose for domestication\r\nin ancient times, either intentionally or by chance, a most abnormal\r\nset of pigeons; for that species resembling such birds as Pouters,\r\nFantails, Carriers, Barbs, Short-faced Tumblers, Turbits, etc., would\r\nbe in the highest degree abnormal, as compared with all the existing\r\nmembers of the great pigeon family, cannot be doubted. Thus we should\r\nhave to believe that man not only formerly succeeded in thoroughly\r\ndomesticating several highly abnormal species, but that these same\r\nspecies have since all become extinct, or are at least now unknown.\r\nThis double accident is so extremely improbable that the assumed\r\nexistence of so many abnormal species would require to be supported by\r\nthe strongest evidence. On the other hand, if all the races are\r\ndescended from _C. livia,_ we can understand, as will hereafter be more\r\nfully explained, how any slight deviation in structure which first\r\nappeared would continually be augmented by the preservation of the most\r\nstrongly marked individuals; and as the power of selection would be\r\napplied according to man’s fancy, and not for the bird’s own good, the\r\naccumulated amount of deviation would certainly be of an abnormal\r\nnature in comparison with the structure of pigeons living in a state of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the remarkable fact that the characteristic\r\ndifferences between the chief domestic races are eminently variable; we\r\nsee this plainly in the great difference in the number of the\r\ntail-feathers in the Fantail, in the development of the crop in\r\nPouters, in the length of the beak in Tumblers, in the state of the\r\nwattle in Carriers, etc. If these characters are the result of\r\nsuccessive variations added together by selection, we can understand\r\nwhy they should be so variable: for these are the very parts which have\r\nvaried since the domestication of the pigeon, and therefore would be\r\nlikely still to vary; these variations moreover have been recently, and\r\nare still being accumulated by man’s selection; therefore they have not\r\nas yet become firmly fixed.\r\n\r\n    _Fifthly._—All the domestic races pair readily together, and, what\r\n    is equally important, their mongrel offspring are perfectly\r\n    fertile. To ascertain this fact I made many experiments, which are\r\n    given in the note below; and recently Mr. Tegetmeier has made\r\n    similar experiments with the same result.[19] The accurate\r\n    Neumeister asserts that when dovecots are crossed with pigeons of\r\n    any other breed, the mongrels are extremely fertile and hardy.[20]\r\n    MM. Boitard and Corbié[21] affirm, after their great experience,\r\n    that the more distinct the breeds are which are crossed, the more\r\n    productive are their mongrel offspring. I admit that the doctrine\r\n    first broached by Pallas is highly probable, if not actually\r\n    proved, namely, that closely allied species, which in a state of\r\n    nature or when first captured would have been in some degree\r\n    sterile if crossed, lose this sterility after a long course of\r\n    domestication; yet when we consider the great difference between\r\n    such races as Pouters, Carriers, Runts, Fantails, Turbits, Tumblers\r\n    etc., the fact of their perfect, or even increased, fertility when\r\n    intercrossed in the most complicated manner becomes a strong\r\n    argument in favour of their having all descended from a single\r\n    species. This argument is rendered much stronger when we hear (I\r\n    append in a note[22] all the cases which I have collected) that\r\n    hardly a single well-ascertained instance is known of hybrids\r\n    between two true species of pigeons being fertile, _inter se,_ or\r\n    even when crossed with one of their pure parents.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly._—Excluding certain important characteristic differences, the\r\nchief races agree most closely both with each other and with _C. livia_\r\nin all other respects. As previously observed, all are eminently\r\nsociable; all dislike to perch or roost, and refuse to build in trees;\r\nall lay two eggs, and this is not a universal rule with the Columbidæ;\r\nall, as far as I can hear, require the same time for hatching their\r\neggs; all can endure the same great range of climate; all prefer the\r\nsame food, and are passionately fond of salt; all exhibit (with the\r\nasserted exception of the Finnikin and Turner which do not differ much\r\nin any other character) the same peculiar gestures when courting the\r\nfemales; and all (with the exception of Trumpeters and Laughers, which\r\nlikewise do not differ much in any other character) coo in the same\r\npeculiar manner, unlike the voice of any other wild pigeon. All the\r\ncoloured breeds display the same peculiar metallic tints on the breast,\r\na character far from general with pigeons. Each race presents nearly\r\nthe same range of variation in colour; and in most of the races we have\r\nthe same singular correlation between the development of down in the\r\nyoung and the future colour of plumage. All have the proportional\r\nlength of their toes, and of their primary wing-feathers, nearly the\r\nsame,—characters which are apt to differ in the several members of the\r\nColumbidæ. In those races which present some remarkable deviation of\r\nstructure, such as in the tail of Fantails, crop of Pouters, beak of\r\nCarriers and Tumblers, etc., the other parts remain nearly unaltered.\r\nNow every naturalist will admit that it would be scarcely possible to\r\npick out a dozen natural species in any family which should agree\r\nclosely in habits and in general structure, and yet should differ\r\ngreatly in a few characters alone. This fact is explicable through the\r\ndoctrine of natural selection; for each successive modification of\r\nstructure in each natural species is preserved, solely because it is of\r\nservice; and such modifications when largely accumulated imply a great\r\nchange in the habits of life, and this will almost certainly lead to\r\nother changes of structure throughout the whole organisation. On the\r\nother hand, if the several races of the pigeon have been produced by\r\nman through selection and variation, we can readily understand how it\r\nis that they should still all resemble each other in habits and in\r\nthose many characters which man has not cared to modify, whilst they\r\ndiffer to so prodigious a degree in those parts which have struck his\r\neye or pleased his fancy.\r\n\r\n    Besides the points above enumerated, in which all the domestic\r\n    races resemble _C. livia_ and each other, there is one which\r\n    deserves special notice. The wild rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue\r\n    colour; the wings are crossed by two bars; the croup varies in\r\n    colour, being generally white in the pigeon of Europe, and blue in\r\n    that of India; the tail has a black bar close to the end, and the\r\n    outer webs of the outer tail-feathers are edged with white, except\r\n    near the tips. These combined characters are not found in any wild\r\n    pigeon besides _C. livia._ I have looked carefully through the\r\n    great collections of pigeons in the British Museum, and I find that\r\n    a dark bar at the end of the tail is common; that the white edging\r\n    to the outer tail-feathers is not rare; but that the white croup is\r\n    extremely rare, and the two black bars on the wings occur in no\r\n    other pigeon, excepting the alpine _C. leuconota_ and _C.\r\n    rupestris_ of Asia. Now if we turn to the domestic races, it is\r\n    highly remarkable, as an eminent fancier, Mr. Wicking, observed to\r\n    me, that, whenever a blue bird appears in any race, the wings\r\n    almost invariably show the double black bars.[23] The primary\r\n    wing-feathers may be white or black, and the whole body may be of\r\n    any colour, but if the wing-coverts are blue, the two black bars\r\n    are sure to appear. I have myself seen, or acquired trustworthy\r\n    evidence, as given below,[24] of blue birds with black bars on the\r\n    wing, with the croup either white or very pale or dark blue, with\r\n    the tail having a terminal black bar, and with the outer feathers\r\n    externally edged with white or very pale coloured, in the following\r\n    races, which, as I carefully observed in each case, appeared to be\r\n    perfectly true: namely, in Pouters, Fantails, Tumblers, Jacobins,\r\n    Turbits, Barbs, Carriers, Runts of three distinct varieties,\r\n    Trumpeters, Swallows, and in many other toy-pigeons, which as being\r\n    closely allied to _C. livia,_ are not worth enumerating. Thus we\r\n    see that, in purely-bred races of every kind known in Europe, blue\r\n    birds occasionally appear having all the marks which characterise\r\n    _C. livia,_ and which concur in no other wild species. Mr. Blyth,\r\n    also, has made the same observation with respect to the various\r\n    domestic races known in India.\r\n\r\n    Certain variations in the plumage are equally common in the wild\r\n    _C. livia,_ in dovecot-pigeons, and in all the most highly modified\r\n    races. Thus, in all, the croup varies from white to blue, being\r\n    most frequently white in Europe, and very generally blue in\r\n    India.[25] We have seen that the wild _C. livia_ in Europe, and\r\n    dovecots in all parts of the world, often have the upper\r\n    wing-coverts chequered with black; and all the most distinct races,\r\n    when blue, are occasionally chequered in precisely the same manner.\r\n    Thus I have seen Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Turbits, Tumblers\r\n    (Indian and English), Swallows, Bald-pates, and other toy-pigeons\r\n    blue and chequered; and Mr. Esquilant has seen a chequered Runt. I\r\n    bred from two pure blue Tumblers a chequered bird.\r\n\r\n    The facts hitherto given refer to the occasional appearance in pure\r\n    races of blue birds with black wing-bars, and likewise of blue and\r\n    chequered birds; but it will now be seen that when two birds\r\n    belonging to distinct races are crossed, neither of which have, nor\r\n    probably have had during many generations, a trace of blue in their\r\n    plumage, or a trace of wing-bars and the other characteristic\r\n    marks, they very frequently produce mongrel offspring of a blue\r\n    colour, sometimes chequered, with black wing-bars, etc.; or if not\r\n    of a blue colour, yet with the several characteristic marks more or\r\n    less plainly developed. I was led to investigate this subject from\r\n    MM. Boitard and Corbié[26] having asserted that from crosses\r\n    between certain breeds it is rare to get anything but bisets or\r\n    dovecot pigeons, which, as we know, are blue birds with the usual\r\n    characteristic marks. We shall hereafter see that this subject\r\n    possesses, independently of our present object, considerable\r\n    interest, so that I will give the results of my own trials in full.\r\n    I selected for experiment races which, when pure, very seldom\r\n    produce birds of a blue colour, or have bars on their wings and\r\n    tail.\r\n\r\nThe Nun is white, with the head, tail, and primary wing-feathers black;\r\nit is a breed which was established as long ago as the year 1600. I\r\ncrossed a male Nun with a female red common Tumbler, which latter\r\nvariety generally breeds true. Thus neither parent had a trace of blue\r\nin the plumage, or of bars on the wing and tail. I should premise that\r\ncommon Tumblers are rarely blue in England. From the above cross I\r\nreared several young: one was red over the whole back, but with the\r\ntail as blue as that of the rock-pigeon; the terminal bar, however, was\r\nabsent, but the outer feathers were edged with white: a second and\r\nthird nearly resembled the first, but the tail in both presented a\r\ntrace of the bar at the end: a fourth was brownish, and the wings\r\nshowed a trace of the double bar: a fifth was pale blue over the whole\r\nbreast, back, croup, and tail, but the neck and primary wing-feathers\r\nwere reddish; the wings presented two distinct bars of a red colour;\r\nthe tail was not barred, but the outer feathers were edged with white.\r\nI crossed this last curiously coloured bird with a black mongrel of\r\ncomplicated descent, namely, from a black Barb, a Spot, and\r\nAlmond-tumbler, so that the two young birds produced from this cross\r\nincluded the blood of five varieties, none of which had a trace of blue\r\nor of wing and tail-bars: one of the two young birds was\r\nbrownish-black, with black wing-bars; the other was reddish-dun, with\r\nreddish wing-bars, paler than the rest of the body, with the croup pale\r\nblue, the tail bluish with a trace of the terminal bar.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Eaton[27] matched two Short-faced Tumblers, namely, a splash\r\n    cock and kite hen (neither of which are blue or barred), and from\r\n    the first nest he got a perfect blue bird, and from the second a\r\n    silver or pale blue bird, both of which, in accordance with all\r\n    analogy, no doubt presented the usual characteristic marks.\r\n\r\n    I crossed two male black Barbs with two female red Spots. These\r\n    latter have the whole body and wings white, with a spot on the\r\n    forehead, the tail and tail-coverts red; the race existed at least\r\n    as long ago as 1676, and now breeds perfectly true, as was known to\r\n    be the case in the year 1735.[28] Barbs are uniformly-coloured\r\n    birds, with rarely even a trace of bars on the wing or tail; they\r\n    are known to breed very true. The mongrels thus raised were black\r\n    or nearly black, or dark or pale brown, sometimes slightly piebald\r\n    with white: of these birds no less than six presented double\r\n    wing-bars; in two the bars were conspicuous and quite black; in\r\n    seven some white feathers appeared on the croup; and in two or\r\n    three there was a trace of the terminal bar to the tail, but in\r\n    none were the outer tail-feathers edged with white.\r\n\r\nI crossed black Barbs (of two excellent strains) with purely-bred,\r\nsnow-white Fantails. The mongrels were generally quite black, with a\r\nfew of the primary wing and tail feathers white: others were dark\r\nreddish-brown, and others snow-white: none had a trace of wing-bars or\r\nof the white croup. I then paired together two of these mongrels,\r\nnamely, a brown and black bird, and their offspring displayed\r\nwing-bars, faint, but of a darker brown than the rest of body. In a\r\nsecond brood from the same parents a brown bird was produced, with\r\nseveral white feathers confined to the croup.\r\n\r\n    I crossed a male dun Dragon belonging to a family which had been\r\n    dun- coloured without wing-bars during several generations, with a\r\n    uniform red Barb (bred from two black Barbs); and the offspring\r\n    presented decided but faint traces of wing-bars. I crossed a\r\n    uniform red male Runt with a White trumpeter; and the offspring had\r\n    a slaty-blue tail with a bar at the end, and with the outer\r\n    feathers edged with white. I also crossed a female black and white\r\n    chequered Trumpeter (of a different strain from the last) with a\r\n    male Almond-tumbler, neither of which exhibited a trace of blue, or\r\n    of the white croup, or of the bar at end of tail: nor is it\r\n    probable that the progenitors of these two birds had for many\r\n    generations exhibited any of these characters, for I have never\r\n    even heard of a blue Trumpeter in this country, and my\r\n    Almond-tumbler was purely bred; yet the tail of this mongrel was\r\n    bluish, with a broad black bar at the end, and the croup was\r\n    perfectly white. It may be observed in several of these cases, that\r\n    the tail first shows a tendency to become by reversion blue; and\r\n    this fact of the persistency of colour in the tail and\r\n    tail-coverts[29] will surprise no one who has attended to the\r\n    crossing of pigeons.\r\n\r\nThe last case which I will give is the most curious. I paired a mongrel\r\nfemale Barb-fantail with a mongrel male Barb-spot; neither of which\r\nmongrels had the least blue about them. Let it be remembered that blue\r\nBarbs are excessively rare; that Spots, as has been already stated,\r\nwere perfectly characterised in the year 1676, and breed perfectly\r\ntrue; this likewise is the case with white Fantails, so much so that I\r\nhave never heard of white Fantails throwing any other colour.\r\nNevertheless the offspring from the above two mongrels was of exactly\r\nthe same blue tint as that of the wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland\r\nIslands over the whole back and wings; the double black wing-bars were\r\nequally conspicuous; the tail was exactly alike in all its characters,\r\nand the croup was pure white; the head, however, was tinted with a\r\nshade of red, evidently derived from the Spot, and was of a paler blue\r\nthan in the rock-pigeon, as was the stomach. So that two black Barbs, a\r\nred Spot, and a white Fantail, as the four purely-bred grandparents,\r\nproduced a bird exhibiting the general blue colour, together with every\r\ncharacteristic mark, the wild _Columba livia._\r\n\r\nWith respect to crossed breeds frequently producing blue birds\r\nchequered with black, and resembling in all respects both the\r\ndovecot-pigeon and the chequered wild variety of the rock-pigeon, the\r\nstatement before referred to by MM. Boitard and Corbié would almost\r\nsuffice; but I will give three instances of the appearance of such\r\nbirds from crosses in which one alone of the parents or\r\ngreat-grandparents was blue, but not chequered. I crossed a male blue\r\nTurbit with a snow-white Trumpeter, and the following year with a dark,\r\nleaden-brown, Short-faced Tumbler; the offspring from the first cross\r\nwere as perfectly chequered as any dovecot-pigeon; and from the second,\r\nso much so as to be nearly as black as the most darkly chequered\r\nrock-pigeon from Madeira. Another bird, whose great-grandparents were a\r\nwhite Trumpeter, a white Fantail, a white Red-spot, a red Runt, and a\r\nblue Pouter, was slaty-blue and chequered exactly like a\r\ndovecot-pigeon. I may here add a remark made to me by Mr. Wicking, who\r\nhas had more experience than any other person in England in breeding\r\npigeons of various colours: namely, that when a blue, or a blue and\r\nchequered bird, having black wing- bars, once appears in any race and\r\nis allowed to breed, these characters are so strongly transmitted that\r\nit is extremely difficult to eradicate them.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are we to conclude from this tendency in all the chief\r\ndomestic races, both when purely bred and more especially when\r\nintercrossed, to produce offspring of a blue colour, with the same\r\ncharacteristic marks, varying in the same manner, as in _Columbia\r\nlivia_? If we admit that these races are all descended from _C. livia,_\r\nno breeder will doubt that the occasional appearance of blue birds thus\r\ncharacterised is accounted for on the well-known principle of “throwing\r\nback” or reversion. Why crossing should give so strong a tendency to\r\nreversion, we do not with certainty know; but abundant evidence of this\r\nfact will be given in the following chapters. It is probable that I\r\nmight have bred even for a century pure black Barbs, Spots, Nuns, white\r\nFantails, Trumpeters, etc., without obtaining a single blue or barred\r\nbird; yet by crossing these breeds I reared in the first and second\r\ngeneration, during the course of only three or four years, a\r\nconsiderable number of young birds, more or less plainly coloured blue,\r\nand with most of the characteristic marks. When black and white, or\r\nblack and red birds, are crossed, it would appear that a slight\r\ntendency exists in both parents to produce blue offspring, and that\r\nthis, when combined, overpowers the separate tendency in either parent\r\nto produce black, or white, or red offspring.\r\n\r\nIf we reject the belief that all the races of the pigeon are the\r\nmodified descendants of _C. livia,_ and suppose that they are descended\r\nfrom several aboriginal stocks, then we must choose between the three\r\nfollowing assumptions: firstly, that at least eight or nine species\r\nformerly existed which were aboriginally coloured in various ways, but\r\nhave since varied in exactly the same manner so as to assume the\r\ncolouring of _C. livia_; but this assumption throws not the least light\r\non the appearance of such colours and marks when the races are crossed.\r\nOr secondly, we may assume that the aboriginal species were all\r\ncoloured blue, and had the wing-bars and other characteristic marks of\r\n_C. livia,_—a supposition which is highly improbable, as besides this\r\none species no existing member of the Columbidæ presents these combined\r\ncharacters; and it would not be possible to find any other instance of\r\nseveral species identical in plumage, yet as different in important\r\npoints of structure as are Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Tumblers, etc.\r\nOr lastly, we may assume that all the races, whether descended from _C.\r\nlivia_ or from several aboriginal species, although they have been bred\r\nwith so much care and are so highly valued by fanciers, have all been\r\ncrossed within a dozen or score of generations with _C. livia,_ and\r\nhave thus acquired their tendency to produce blue birds with the\r\nseveral characteristic marks. I have said that it must be assumed that\r\neach race has been crossed with _C. livia_ within a dozen, or, at the\r\nutmost, within a score of generations; for there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that crossed offspring ever revert to one of their ancestors\r\nwhen removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed which has\r\nbeen crossed only once, the tendency to reversion will naturally become\r\nless and less in the succeeding generations, as in each there will be\r\nless and less of the blood of the foreign breed; but when there has\r\nbeen no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both\r\nparents to revert to some long-lost character, this tendency, for all\r\nthat we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an\r\nindefinite number of generations. These two distinct cases of reversion\r\nare often confounded together by those who have written on inheritance.\r\n\r\nConsidering, on the one hand, the improbability of the three\r\nassumptions which have just been discussed, and, on the other hand, how\r\nsimply the facts are explained on the principle of reversion, we may\r\nconclude that the occasional appearance in all the races, both when\r\npurely bred and more especially when crossed, of blue birds, sometimes\r\nchequered, with double wing-bars, with white or blue croups, with a bar\r\nat the end of the tail, and with the outer tail-feathers edged with\r\nwhite, affords an argument of the greatest weight in favour of the view\r\nthat all are descended from _Columba livia,_ including under this name\r\nthe three or four wild varieties or sub-species before enumerated.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the six foregoing arguments, which are opposed to the belief\r\nthat the chief domestic races are the descendants of at least eight or\r\nnine or perhaps a dozen species; for the crossing of any less number\r\nwould not yield the characteristic differences between the several\r\nraces. _ Firstly,_ the improbability that so many species should still\r\nexist somewhere, but be unknown to ornithologists, or that they should\r\nhave become within the historical period extinct, although man has had\r\nso little influence in exterminating the wild _C. livia. Secondly,_ the\r\nimprobability of man in former times having thoroughly domesticated and\r\nrendered fertile under confinement so many species. _Thirdly,_ these\r\nsupposed species having nowhere become feral. _Fourthly,_ the\r\nextraordinary fact that man should, intentionally or by chance, have\r\nchosen for domestication several species, extremely abnormal in\r\ncharacter; and furthermore, the points of structure which render these\r\nsupposed species so abnormal being now highly variable. _Fifthly,_ the\r\nfact of all the races, though differing in many important points of\r\nstructure, producing perfectly fertile mongrels; whilst all the hybrids\r\nwhich have been produced between even closely allied species in the\r\npigeon-family are sterile. _Sixthly,_ the remarkable statements just\r\ngiven on the tendency in all the races, both when purely bred and when\r\ncrossed, to revert in numerous minute details of colouring to the\r\ncharacter of the wild rock-pigeon, and to vary in a similar manner. To\r\nthese arguments may be added the extreme improbability that a number of\r\nspecies formerly existed, which differed greatly from each other in\r\nsome few points, but which resembled each other as closely as do the\r\ndomestic races in other points of structure, in voice, and in all their\r\nhabits of life. When these several facts and arguments are fairly taken\r\ninto consideration, it would require an overwhelming amount of evidence\r\nto make us admit that the chief domestic races are descended from\r\nseveral aboriginal stocks; and of such evidence there is absolutely\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe belief that the chief domestic races are descended from several\r\nwild stocks no doubt has arisen from the apparent improbability of such\r\ngreat modifications of structure having been effected since man first\r\ndomesticated the rock-pigeon. Nor am I surprised at any degree of\r\nhesitation in admitting their common parentage: formerly, when I went\r\ninto my aviaries and watched such birds as Pouters, Carriers, Barbs,\r\nFantails, and Short-faced Tumblers, etc., I could not persuade myself\r\nthat all had descended from the same wild stock, and that man had\r\nconsequently in one sense created these remarkable modifications.\r\nTherefore I have argued the question of their origin at great, and, as\r\nsome will think, superfluous length.\r\n\r\n    Finally, in favour of the belief that all the races are descended\r\n    from a single stock, we have in _Columba livia_ a still existing\r\n    and widely distributed species, which can be and has been\r\n    domesticated in various countries. This species agrees in most\r\n    points of structure and in all its habits of life, as well as\r\n    occasionally in every detail of plumage, with the several domestic\r\n    races. It breeds freely with them, and produces fertile offspring.\r\n    It varies in a state of nature,[30] and still more so when\r\n    semi-domesticated, as shown by comparing the Sierra Leone pigeons\r\n    with those of India, or with those which apparently have run wild\r\n    in Madeira. It has undergone a still greater amount of variation in\r\n    the case of the numerous toy-pigeons, which no one supposes to be\r\n    descended from distinct species; yet some of these toy-pigeons have\r\n    transmitted their character truly for centuries. Why, then, should\r\n    we hesitate to believe in that greater amount of variation which is\r\n    necessary for the production of the eleven chief races? It should\r\n    be borne in mind that in two of the most strongly-marked races,\r\n    namely, Carriers and Short-faced Tumblers, the extreme forms can be\r\n    connected with the parent-species by graduated differences not\r\n    greater than those which may be observed between the\r\n    dovecot-pigeons inhabiting different countries, or between the\r\n    various kinds of toy-pigeons,—gradations which must certainly be\r\n    attributed to variation.\r\n\r\n    That circumstances have been eminently favourable for the\r\n    modification of the pigeon through variation and selection will now\r\n    be shown. The earliest record, as has been pointed out to me by\r\n    Professor Lepsius, of pigeons in a domesticated condition, occurs\r\n    in the fifth Egyptian dynasty, about 3000 B.C.;[31] but Mr. Birch,\r\n    of the British Museum, informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill\r\n    of fare in the previous dynasty. Domestic pigeons are mentioned in\r\n    Genesis, Leviticus, and Isaiah.[32] In the time of the Romans, as\r\n    we hear from Pliny,[33] immense prices were given for pigeons;\r\n    “nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their\r\n    pedigree and race.” In India, about the year 1600, pigeons were\r\n    much valued by Akbar Khan: 20,000 birds were carried about with the\r\n    court, and the merchants brought valuable collections. “The monarch\r\n    of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare breeds. His Majesty,”\r\n    says the courtly historian, “by crossing the breeds, which method\r\n    was never practised before, has improved them astonishingly.”[34]\r\n    Akber Khan possessed seventeen distinct kinds, eight of which were\r\n    valuable for beauty alone. At about this same period of 1600 the\r\n    Dutch, according to Aldrovandi, were as eager about pigeons as the\r\n    Romans had formerly been. The breeds which were kept during the\r\n    fifteenth century in Europe and in India apparently differed from\r\n    each other. Tavernier, in his Travels in 1677, speaks, as does\r\n    Chardin in 1735, of the vast number of pigeon-houses in Persia; and\r\n    the former remarks that, as Christians were not permitted to keep\r\n    pigeons, some of the vulgar actually turned Mahometans for this\r\n    sole purpose. The Emperor of Morocco had his favourite keeper of\r\n    pigeons, as is mentioned in Moore’s treatise, published 1737. In\r\n    England, from the time of Willughby in 1678 to the present day, as\r\n    well as in Germany and in France, numerous treatises have been\r\n    published on the pigeon. In India, about a hundred years ago, a\r\n    Persian treatise was written; and the writer thought it no light\r\n    affair, for he begins with a solemn invocation, “in the name of\r\n    God, the gracious and merciful.” Many large towns, in Europe and\r\n    the United States, now have their societies of devoted\r\n    pigeon-fanciers: at present there are three such societies in\r\n    London. In India, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, the inhabitants of\r\n    Delhi and of some other great cities are eager fanciers. Mr. Layard\r\n    informs me that most of the known breeds are kept in Ceylon. In\r\n    China, according to Mr. Swinhoe of Amoy, and Dr. Lockhart of\r\n    Shangai, Carriers, Fantails, Tumblers, and other varieties are\r\n    reared with care, especially by the bonzes or priests. The Chinese\r\n    fasten a kind of whistle to the tail-feathers of their pigeons, and\r\n    as the flock wheels through the air they produce a sweet sound. In\r\n    Egypt the late Abbas Pacha was a great fancier of Fantails. Many\r\n    pigeons are kept at Cairo and Constantinople, and these have lately\r\n    been imported by native merchants, as I hear from Sir W. Elliot,\r\n    into Southern India, and sold at high prices.\r\n\r\n    The foregoing statements show in how many countries, and during how\r\n    long a period, many men have been passionately devoted to the\r\n    breeding of pigeons. Hear how an enthusiastic fancier at the\r\n    present day writes: “If it were possible for noblemen and gentlemen\r\n    to know the amazing amount of solace and pleasure derived from\r\n    Almond Tumblers, when they begin to understand their properties, I\r\n    should think that scarce any nobleman or gentleman would be without\r\n    their aviaries of Almond Tumblers.”[35] The pleasure thus taken is\r\n    of paramount importance, as it leads amateurs carefully to note and\r\n    preserve each slight deviation of structure which strikes their\r\n    fancy. Pigeons are often closely confined during their whole lives;\r\n    they do not partake of their naturally varied diet; they have often\r\n    been transported from one climate to another; and all these changes\r\n    in their conditions of life would be likely to cause variability.\r\n    Pigeons have been domesticated for nearly 5000 years, and have been\r\n    kept in many places, so that the numbers reared under domestication\r\n    must have been enormous: and this is another circumstance of high\r\n    importance, for it obviously favours the chance of rare\r\n    modifications of structure occasionally appearing. Slight\r\n    variations of all kinds would almost certainly be observed, and, if\r\n    valued, would, owing to the following circumstances, be preserved\r\n    and propagated with unusual facility. Pigeons, differently from any\r\n    other domesticated animal, can easily be mated for life, and,\r\n    though kept with other pigeons, rarely prove unfaithful to each\r\n    other. Even when the male does break his marriage-vow, he does not\r\n    permanently desert his mate. I have bred in the same aviaries many\r\n    pigeons of different kinds, and never reared a single bird of an\r\n    impure strain. Hence a fancier can with the greatest ease select\r\n    and match his birds. He will also see the good results of his care;\r\n    for pigeons breed with extraordinary rapidity. He may freely reject\r\n    inferior birds, as they serve at an early age as excellent food.\r\n\r\n      _History of the principal Races of the Pigeon._[36]\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the means and steps by which the chief races have\r\nbeen formed, it will be advisable to give some historical details, for\r\nmore is known of the history of the pigeon, little though this is, than\r\nof any other domesticated animal. Some of the cases are interesting as\r\nproving how long domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the\r\nsame or nearly the same characters; and other cases are still more\r\ninteresting as showing how slowly but steadily races have been greatly\r\nmodified during successive generations. In the last chapter I stated\r\nthat Trumpeters and Laughers, both so remarkable for their voices, seem\r\nto have been perfectly characterised in 1735; and Laughers were\r\napparently known in India before the year 1600. Spots in 1676, and Nuns\r\nin the time of Aldrovandi, before 1600, were coloured exactly as they\r\nnow are. Common Tumblers and Ground Tumblers displayed in India, before\r\nthe year 1600, the same extraordinary peculiarities of flight as at the\r\npresent day, for they are well described in the ‘Ayeen Akbery.’ These\r\nbreeds may all have existed for a much longer period; we know only that\r\nthey were perfectly characterised at the dates above given. The _\r\naverage_ length of life of the domestic pigeon is probably about five\r\nor six years; if so, some of these races have retained their character\r\nperfectly for at least forty or fifty generations.\r\n\r\n    _Pouters._—These birds, as far as a very short description serves\r\n    for comparison, appear to have been well characterised in\r\n    Aldrovandi’s time,[37] before the year 1600. Length of body and\r\n    length of leg are at the present time the two chief points of\r\n    excellence. In 1735 Moore said (see Mr. J. M. Eaton’s edition)—and\r\n    Moore was a first-rate fancier—that he once saw a bird with a body\r\n    20 inches in length, “though 17 or 18 inches is reckoned a very\r\n    good length;” and he has seen the legs very nearly 7 inches in\r\n    length, yet a leg 6½ or 6¾ long “must be allowed to be a very good\r\n    one.” Mr. Bult, the most successful breeder of Pouters in the\r\n    world, informs me that at present (1858) the standard length of the\r\n    body is not less than 18 inches; but he has measured one bird 19\r\n    inches in length, and has heard of 20 and 22 inches, but doubts the\r\n    truth of these latter statements. The standard length of the leg is\r\n    now 7 inches, but Mr. Bult has recently measured two of his own\r\n    birds with legs 7½ long. So that in the 123 years which have\r\n    elapsed since 1735 there has been hardly any increase in the\r\n    standard length of the body; 17 or 18 inches was formerly reckoned\r\n    a very good length, and now 18 inches is the minimum standard; but\r\n    the length of leg seems to have increased, as Moore never saw one\r\n    quite 7 inches long; now the standard is 7, and two of Mr. Bult’s\r\n    birds measured 7½ inches in length. The extremely slight\r\n    improvement in Pouters, except in the length of the leg, during the\r\n    last 123 years, may be partly accounted for by the neglect which\r\n    they suffered, as I am informed by Mr. Bult, until within the last\r\n    20 or 30 years. About 1765[38] there was a change of fashion,\r\n    stouter and more feathered legs being preferred to thin and nearly\r\n    naked legs.\r\n\r\n    _Fantails._—The first notice of the existence of this breed is in\r\n    India, before the year 1600, as given in the ‘Ayeen Akbery;’[39] at\r\n    this date, judging from Aldrovandi, the breed was unknown in\r\n    Europe. In 1677 Willughby speaks of a Fantail with 26\r\n    tail-feathers; in 1735 Moore saw one with 36 feathers; and in 1824\r\n    MM. Boitard and Corbié assert that in France birds can easily be\r\n    found with 42 tail-feathers. In England, the number of the\r\n    tail-feathers is not at present so much regarded as their upward\r\n    direction and expansion. The general carriage of the bird is\r\n    likewise now much valued. The old descriptions do not suffice to\r\n    show whether in these latter respects there has been much\r\n    improvement: but if Fantails with their heads and tails touching\r\n    had formerly existed, as at the present time, the fact would almost\r\n    certainly have been noticed. The Fantails which are now found in\r\n    India probably show the state of the race, as far as carriage is\r\n    concerned, at the date of their introduction into Europe; and some,\r\n    said to have been brought from Calcutta, which I kept alive, were\r\n    in a marked manner inferior to our exhibition birds. The Java\r\n    Fantail shows the same difference in carriage; and although Mr.\r\n    Swinhoe has counted 18 and 24 tail-feathers in his birds, a\r\n    first-rate specimen sent to me had only 14 tail-feathers.\r\n\r\n_Jacobins._—This breed existed before 1600, but the hood, judging from\r\nthe figure given by Aldrovandi, did not enclose the head nearly so\r\nperfectly as at present: nor was the head then white; nor were the\r\nwings and tail so long, but this last character might have been\r\noverlooked by the rude artist. In Moore’s time, in 1735, the Jacobin\r\nwas considered the smallest kind of pigeon, and the bill is said to be\r\nvery short. Hence either the Jacobin, or the other kinds with which it\r\nwas then compared, must since that time have been considerably\r\nmodified; for Moore’s description (and it must be remembered that he\r\nwas a first-rate judge) is clearly not applicable, as far as size of\r\nbody and length of beak are concerned, to our present Jacobins. In\r\n1795, judging from Bechstein, the breed had assumed its present\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_Turbits._—It has generally been supposed by the older writers on\r\npigeons, that the Turbit is the Cortbeck of Aldrovandi; but if this be\r\nthe case, it is an extraordinary fact that the characteristic frill\r\nshould not have been noticed. The beak, moreover, of the Cortbeck is\r\ndescribed as closely resembling that of the Jacobin, which shows a\r\nchange in the one or the other race. The Turbit, with its\r\ncharacteristic frill, and bearing its present name, is described by\r\nWillughby in 1677; and the bill is said to be like that of the\r\nbullfinch,—a good comparison, but now more strictly applicable to the\r\nbeak of the Barb. The sub-breed called the Owl was well known in\r\nMoore’s time, in 1735.\r\n\r\n    _Tumblers._—Common Tumblers, as well as Ground Tumblers, perfect as\r\n    far as tumbling is concerned, existed in India before the year\r\n    1600; and at this period diversified modes of flight, such as\r\n    flying at night, the ascent to a great height, and manner of\r\n    descent, seem to have been much attended to in India, as at the\r\n    present time. Belon[40] in 1555 saw in Paphlagonia what he\r\n    describes as “a very new thing, viz. pigeons which flew so high in\r\n    the air that they were lost to view, but returned to their\r\n    pigeon-house without separating.” This manner of flight is\r\n    characteristic of our present Tumblers, but it is clear that Belon\r\n    would have mentioned the act of tumbling if the pigeons described\r\n    by him had tumbled. Tumblers were not known in Europe in 1600, as\r\n    they are not mentioned by Aldrovandi, who discusses the flight of\r\n    pigeons. They are briefly alluded to by Willughby, in 1687, as\r\n    small pigeons “which show like footballs in the air.” The\r\n    short-faced race did not exist at this period, as Willughby could\r\n    not have overlooked birds so remarkable for their small size and\r\n    short beaks. We can even trace some of the steps by which this race\r\n    has been produced. Moore in 1735 enumerates correctly the chief\r\n    points of excellence, but does not give any description of the\r\n    several sub-breeds; and from this fact Mr. Eaton infers[41] that\r\n    the Short-faced Tumbler had not then come to full perfection. Moore\r\n    even speaks of the Jacobin as being the smallest pigeon. Thirty\r\n    years afterwards, in 1765, in the Treatise dedicated to Mayor,\r\n    short-faced Almond Tumblers are fully described, but the author, an\r\n    excellent fancier, expressly states in his Preface (p. xiv.) that,\r\n    “from great care and expense in breeding them, they have arrived to\r\n    so great perfection and are so different from what they were 20 or\r\n    30 years past, that an old fancier would have condemned them for no\r\n    other reason than because they are not like what used to be thought\r\n    good when he was in the fancy before.” Hence it would appear that\r\n    there was a rather sudden change in the character of the\r\n    short-faced Tumbler at about this period; and there is reason to\r\n    suspect that a dwarfed and half-monstrous bird, the parent-form of\r\n    the several short-faced sub-breeds, then appeared. I suspect this\r\n    because short-faced Tumblers are born with their beaks (ascertained\r\n    by careful measurement) as short, proportionally with the size of\r\n    their bodies, as in the adult bird; and in this respect they differ\r\n    greatly from all other breeds, which slowly acquire during growth\r\n    their various characteristic qualities.\r\n\r\n    Since the year 1765 there has been some change in one of the chief\r\n    characters of the short-faced Tumbler, namely, in the length of the\r\n    beak. Fanciers measure the “head and beak” from the tip of the beak\r\n    to the front corner of the eyeball. About the year 1765 a “head and\r\n    beak” was considered good,[42] which, measured in the usual manner,\r\n    was 7/8 of an inch in length; now it ought not to exceed 5/8 of an\r\n    inch; “it is however possible,” as Mr. Eaton candidly\r\n    confesses,“for a bird to be considered as pleasant or neat even at\r\n    6/8 of an inch, but exceeding that length it must be looked upon as\r\n    unworthy of attention.” Mr. Eaton states that he has never seen in\r\n    the course of his life more than two or three birds with the “head\r\n    and beak” not exceeding half an inch in length; “still I believe in\r\n    the course of a few years that the head and beak will be shortened,\r\n    and that half-inch birds will not be considered so great a\r\n    curiosity as at the present time.” That Mr. Eaton’s opinion\r\n    deserves attention cannot be doubted, considering his success in\r\n    winning prizes at our exhibitions. Finally in regard to the Tumbler\r\n    it may be concluded from the facts above given that it was\r\n    originally introduced into Europe, probably first into England,\r\n    from the East; and that it then resembled our common English\r\n    Tumbler, or more probably the Persian or Indian Tumbler, with a\r\n    beak only just perceptibly shorter than that of the common\r\n    dovecot-pigeon. With respect to the short-faced Tumbler, which is\r\n    not known to exist in the East, there can hardly be a doubt that\r\n    the whole wonderful change in the size of the head, beak, body and\r\n    feet, and in general carriage, has been produced during the last\r\n    two centuries by continued selection, aided probably by the birth\r\n    of a semi- monstrous bird somewhere about the year 1750.\r\n\r\n_Runts._—Of their history little can be said. In the time of Pliny the\r\npigeons of Campania were the largest known; and from this fact alone\r\nsome authors assert that they were Runts. In Aldrovandi’s time, in\r\n1600, two sub-breeds existed; but one of them, the short-beaked, is now\r\nextinct in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Barbs._—Notwithstanding statements to the contrary, it seems to me\r\nimpossible to recognise the Barb in Aldrovandi’s description and\r\nfigures; four breeds, however, existed in the year 1600 which evidently\r\nwere allied both to Barbs and Carriers. To show how difficult it is to\r\nrecognise some of the breeds described by Aldrovandi I will give the\r\ndifferent opinions in regard to the above four kinds, named by him _C.\r\nindica, cretensis, gutturosa,_ and _persica._ Willughby thought that\r\nthe _Columba indica_ was a Turbit, but the eminent fancier Mr. Brent\r\nbelieves that it was an inferior Barb: _C. cretensis,_ with a short\r\nbeak and a swelling on the upper mandible, cannot be recognised: _C._\r\n(falsely called) _gutturosa,_ which from its _rostrum, breve, crassum,\r\net tuberosum_ seems to me to come nearest to the Barb, Mr. Brent\r\nbelieves to be a Carrier; and lastly, the _C. persica et turcica,_ Mr.\r\nBrent thinks, and I quite concur with him, was a short-beaked Carrier\r\nwith very little wattle. In 1687 the Barb was known in England, and\r\nWillughby describes the beak as like that of the Turbit; but it is not\r\ncredible that his Barbs should have had a beak like that of our present\r\nbirds, for so accurate an observer could not have overlooked its great\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\n    _English Carrier._—We may look in vain in Aldrovandi’s work for any\r\n    bird resembling our prize Carriers; the _C. persica et turcica_ of\r\n    this author comes the nearest, but is said to have had a short\r\n    thick beak; therefore it must have approached in character a Barb,\r\n    and have differed greatly from our Carriers. In Willughby’s time,\r\n    in 1677, we can clearly recognise the Carrier, yet he adds, “the\r\n    bill is not short, but of a moderate length;” a description which\r\n    no one would apply to our present Carriers, so conspicuous for the\r\n    extraordinary length of their beaks. The old names given in Europe\r\n    to the Carrier, and the several names now in use in India, indicate\r\n    that Carriers originally came from Persia; and Willughby’s\r\n    description would perfectly apply to the Bussorah Carrier as it now\r\n    exists in Madras. In later times we can partially trace the\r\n    progress of change in our English Carriers: Moore, in 1735, says\r\n    “an inch and a half is reckoned a long beak, though there are very\r\n    good Carriers that are found not to exceed an inch and a quarter.”\r\n    These birds must have resembled or perhaps been a little superior\r\n    to the Carriers, previously described, now found in Persia. In\r\n    England at the present day “there are,” as Mr. Eaton[43] states,\r\n    “beaks that would measure (from edge of eye to tip of beak) one\r\n    inch and three-quarters, and some few even two inches in length.”\r\n\r\nFrom these historical details we see that nearly all the chief domestic\r\nraces existed before the year 1600. Some remarkable only for colour\r\nappear to have been identical with our present breeds, some were nearly\r\nthe same, some considerably different, and some have since become\r\nextinct. Several breeds, such as Finnikins and Turners, the\r\nswallow-tailed pigeon of Bechstein and the Carmelite, seem to have\r\noriginated and to have disappeared within this same period. Any one now\r\nvisiting a well-stocked English aviary would certainly pick out as the\r\nmost distinct kinds, the massive Runt, the Carrier with its wonderfully\r\nelongated beak and great wattles, the Barb with its short broad beak\r\nand eye-wattles, the short-faced Tumbler with its small conical beak,\r\nthe Pouter with its great crop, long legs and body, the Fantail with\r\nits upraised, widely-expanded, well-feathered tail, the Turbit with its\r\nfrill and short blunt beak, and the Jacobin with his hood. Now, if this\r\nsame person could have viewed the pigeons kept before 1600 by Akber\r\nKhan in India and by Aldrovandi in Europe, he would have seen the\r\nJacobin with a less perfect hood; the Turbit apparently without its\r\nfrill; the Pouter with shorter legs, and in every way less\r\nremarkable—that is, if Aldrovandi’s Pouter resembled the old German\r\nkind; the Fantail would have been far less singular in appearance, and\r\nwould have had much fewer feathers in its tail; he would have seen\r\nexcellent flying Tumblers, but he would in vain have looked for the\r\nmarvellous short-faced breeds; he would have seen birds allied to\r\nBarbs, but it is extremely doubtful whether he would have met with our\r\nactual Barbs; and lastly, he would have found Carriers with beaks and\r\nwattle incomparably less developed than in our English Carriers. He\r\nmight have classed most of the breeds in the same groups as at present;\r\nbut the differences between the groups were then far less strongly\r\npronounced than at present. In short, the several breeds had at this\r\nearly period not diverged in so great a degree as now from their\r\naboriginal common parent, the wild rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n      _Manner of Formation of the chief Races._\r\n\r\nWe will now consider more closely the probable steps by which the chief\r\nraces have been formed. As long as pigeons are kept semi-domesticated\r\nin dovecots in their native country, without any care in selecting and\r\nmatching them, they are liable to little more variation than the wild\r\n_C. livia,_ namely, in the wings becoming chequered with black, in the\r\ncroup being blue or white, and in the size of the body. When, however,\r\ndovecot-pigeons are transported into diversified countries, such as\r\nSierra Leone, the Malay archipelago, and Madeira, they are exposed to\r\nnew conditions of life; and apparently in consequence vary in a\r\nsomewhat greater degree. When closely confined, either for the pleasure\r\nof watching them, or to prevent their straying, they must be exposed,\r\neven in their native climate, to considerably different conditions; for\r\nthey cannot obtain their natural diversity of food; and, what is\r\nprobably more important, they are abundantly fed, whilst debarred from\r\ntaking much exercise. Under these circumstances we might expect to\r\nfind, from the analogy of all other domesticated animals, a greater\r\namount of individual variability than with the wild pigeon; and this is\r\nthe case. The want of exercise apparently tends to reduce the size of\r\nthe feet and organs of flight; and then, from the law of correlation of\r\ngrowth, the beak apparently becomes affected. From what we now see\r\noccasionally taking place in our aviaries, we may conclude that sudden\r\nvariations or sports, such as the appearance of a crest of feathers on\r\nthe head, of feathered feet, of a new shade of colour, of an additional\r\nfeather in the tail or wing, would occur at rare intervals during the\r\nmany centuries which have elapsed since the pigeon was first\r\ndomesticated. At the present day such “sports” are generally rejected\r\nas blemishes; and there is so much mystery in the breeding of pigeons\r\nthat, if a valuable sport did occur, its history would often be\r\nconcealed. Before the last hundred and fifty years, there is hardly a\r\nchance of the history of any such sport having been recorded. But it by\r\nno means follows from this that such sports in former times, when the\r\npigeon had undergone much less variation, would have been rejected. We\r\nare profoundly ignorant of the cause of each sudden and apparently\r\nspontaneous variation, as well as of the infinitely numerous shades of\r\ndifference between the birds of the same family. But in a future\r\nchapter we shall see that all such variations appear to be the indirect\r\nresult of changes of some kind in the conditions of life.\r\n\r\nHence, after a long course of domestication, we might expect to see in\r\nthe pigeon much individual variability, and occasional sudden\r\nvariations, as well as slight modifications from the lessened use of\r\ncertain parts, together with the effects of correlation of growth. But\r\nwithout selection all this would produce only a trifling or no result;\r\nfor without such aid differences of all kinds would, from the two\r\nfollowing causes, soon disappear. In a healthy and vigorous lot of\r\npigeons many more young birds are killed for food or die than are\r\nreared to maturity; so that an individual having any peculiar\r\ncharacter, if not selected, would run a good chance of being destroyed;\r\nand if not destroyed, the peculiarity in question would generally be\r\nobliterated by free intercrossing. It might, however, occasionally\r\nhappen that the same variation repeatedly occurred, owing to the action\r\nof peculiar and uniform conditions of life, and in this case it would\r\nprevail independently of selection. But when selection is brought into\r\nplay all is changed; for this is the foundation-stone in the formation\r\nof new races; and with the pigeon, circumstances, as we have already\r\nseen, are eminently favourable for selection. When a bird presenting\r\nsome conspicuous variation has been preserved, and its offspring have\r\nbeen selected, carefully matched, and again propagated, and so onwards\r\nduring successive generations, the principle is so obvious that nothing\r\nmore need be said about it. This may be called _methodical selection,_\r\nfor the breeder has a distinct object in view, namely, to preserve some\r\ncharacter which has actually appeared; or to create some improvement\r\nalready pictured in his mind.\r\n\r\nAnother form of selection has hardly been noticed by those authors who\r\nhave discussed this subject, but is even more important. This form may\r\nbe called _unconscious selection,_ for the breeder selects his birds\r\nunconsciously, unintentionally, and without method, yet he surely\r\nthough slowly produces a great result. I refer to the effects which\r\nfollow from each fancier at first procuring and afterwards rearing as\r\ngood birds as he can, according to his skill, and according to the\r\nstandard of excellence at each successive period. He does not wish\r\npermanently to modify the breed; he does not look to the distant\r\nfuture, or speculate on the final result of the slow accumulation\r\nduring many generations of successive slight changes; he is content if\r\nhe possesses a good stock, and more than content if he can beat his\r\nrivals. The fancier in the time of Aldrovandi, when in the year 1600 he\r\nadmired his own Jacobins, Pouters, or Carriers, never reflected what\r\ntheir descendants in the year 1860 would become: he would have been\r\nastonished could he have seen our Jacobins, our improved English\r\nCarriers, and our Pouters; he would probably have denied that they were\r\nthe descendants of his own once-admired stock, and he would perhaps not\r\nhave valued them, for no other reason, as was written in 1765, “than\r\nbecause they were not like what used to be thought good when he was in\r\nthe fancy.” No one will attribute the lengthened beak of the Carrier,\r\nthe shortened beak of the Short-faced Tumbler, the lengthened leg of\r\nthe Pouter, the more perfectly enclosed hood of the Jacobin,\r\netc.—changes effected since the time of Aldrovandi, or even since a\r\nmuch later period,—to the direct and immediate action of the conditions\r\nof life. For these several races have been modified in various and even\r\nin directly opposite ways, though kept under the same climate and\r\ntreated in all respects in as nearly uniform a manner as possible. Each\r\nslight change in the length or shortness of the beak, in the length of\r\nleg, etc., has no doubt been indirectly and remotely caused by some\r\nchange in the conditions to which the bird has been subjected, but we\r\nmust attribute the final result, as is manifest in those cases of which\r\nwe have any historical record, to the continued selection and\r\naccumulation of many slight successive variations.\r\n\r\n    The action of unconscious selection, as far as pigeons are\r\n    concerned, depends on a universal principle in human nature,\r\n    namely, on our rivalry, and desire to outdo our neighbours. We see\r\n    this in every fleeting fashion, even in our dress, and it leads the\r\n    fancier to endeavour to exaggerate every peculiarity in his breeds.\r\n    A great authority on pigeons,[44] says, “Fanciers do not and will\r\n    not admire a medium standard, that is, half and half, which is\r\n    neither here nor there, but admire extremes.” After remarking that\r\n    the fancier of Short-faced Beard Tumblers wishes for a very short\r\n    beak, and that the fancier of Long-faced Beard Tumblers wishes for\r\n    a very long beak, he says, with respect to one of intermediate\r\n    length, “Don’t deceive yourself. Do you suppose for a moment the\r\n    short or the long-faced fancier would accept such a bird as a gift?\r\n    Certainly not; the short-faced fancier could see no beauty in it;\r\n    the long-faced fancier would swear there was no use in it, etc.” In\r\n    these comical passages, written seriously, we see the principle\r\n    which has ever guided fanciers, and has led to such great\r\n    modifications in all the domestic races which are valued solely for\r\n    their beauty or curiosity.\r\n\r\nFashions in pigeon-breeding endure for long periods; we cannot change\r\nthe structure of a bird as quickly as we can the fashion of our dress.\r\nIn the time of Aldrovandi, no doubt the more the pouter inflated his\r\ncrop, the more he was valued. Nevertheless, fashions do to a certain\r\nextent change; first one point of structure and then another is\r\nattended to; or different breeds are admired at different times and in\r\ndifferent countries. As the author just quoted remarks, “the fancy ebbs\r\nand flows; a thorough fancier now-a-days never stoops to breed\r\ntoy-birds;” yet these very “toys” are now most carefully bred in\r\nGermany. Breeds which at the present time are highly valued in India\r\nare considered worthless in England. No doubt, when breeds are\r\nneglected, they degenerate; still we may believe that, as long as they\r\nare kept under the same conditions of life, characters once gained will\r\nbe partially retained for a long time, and may form the starting-point\r\nfor a future course of selection.\r\n\r\nLet it not be objected to this view of the action of unconscious\r\nselection that fanciers would not observe or care for extremely slight\r\ndifferences. Those alone who have associated with fanciers can be\r\nthoroughly aware of their accurate powers of discrimination acquired by\r\nlong practice, and of the care and labour which they bestow on their\r\nbirds. I have known a fancier deliberately study his birds day after\r\nday to settle which to match together and which to reject. Observe how\r\ndifficult the subject appears to one of the most eminent and\r\nexperienced fanciers. Mr. Eaton, the winner of many prizes, says, “I\r\nwould here particularly guard you against keeping too great a variety\r\nof pigeons, otherwise you will know a little about all the kinds, but\r\nnothing about one as it ought to be known.” “It is possible there may\r\nbe a few fanciers that have a good general knowledge of the several\r\nfancy pigeons, but there are many who labour under the delusion of\r\nsupposing they know what they do not.” Speaking exclusively of one sub-\r\nvariety of one race, namely, the short-faced almond tumbler, and after\r\nsaying that some fanciers sacrifice every property to obtain a good\r\nhead and beak, and that other fanciers sacrifice everything for\r\nplumage, he remarks: “Some young fanciers who are over covetous go in\r\nfor all the five properties at once, and they have their reward by\r\ngetting nothing.” In India, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, pigeons are\r\nlikewise selected and matched with the greatest care. We must not judge\r\nof the slight divergences from existing varieties which would have been\r\nvalued in ancient days, by those which are now valued after the\r\nformation of so many races, each with its own standard of perfection,\r\nkept uniform by our numerous Exhibitions. The ambition of the most\r\nenergetic fancier may be fully satisfied by the difficulty of excelling\r\nother fanciers in the breeds already established, without trying to\r\nform a new one.\r\n\r\n    A difficulty with respect to the power of selection will perhaps\r\n    already have occurred to the reader, namely, what could have led\r\n    fanciers first to attempt to make such singular breeds as Pouters,\r\n    Fantails, Carriers, etc.? But it is this very difficulty which the\r\n    principle of unconscious selection removes. Undoubtedly no fancier\r\n    ever did intentionally make such an attempt. All that we need\r\n    suppose is that a variation occurred sufficiently marked to catch\r\n    the discriminating eye of some ancient fancier, and then\r\n    unconscious selection carried on for many generations, that is, the\r\n    wish of succeeding fanciers to excel their rivals, would do the\r\n    rest. In the case of the Fantail we may suppose that the first\r\n    progenitor of the breed had a tail only slightly erected, as may\r\n    now be seen in certain Runts,[45] with some increase in the number\r\n    of the tail-feathers, as now occasionally occurs with Nuns. In the\r\n    case of the Pouter we may suppose that some bird inflated its crop\r\n    a little more than other pigeons, as is now the case in a slight\r\n    degree with the œesophagus of the Turbit. We do not know the origin\r\n    of the common Tumbler, but we may suppose that a bird was born with\r\n    some affection of the brain, leading it to make somersaults in the\r\n    air;[46] and before the year 1600 pigeons remarkable for their\r\n    diversified manner of flight were much valued in India, and by the\r\n    order of the Emperor Akber Khan were sedulously trained and\r\n    carefully matched.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases we have supposed that a sudden variation,\r\nconspicuous enough to catch a fancier’s eye, first appeared; but even\r\nthis degree of abruptness in the process of variation is not necessary\r\nfor the formation of a new breed. When the same kind of pigeon has been\r\nkept pure, and has been bred during a long period by two or more\r\nfanciers, slight differences in the strain can often be recognised.\r\nThus I have seen first- rate Jacobins in one man’s possession which\r\ncertainly differed slightly in several characters from those kept by\r\nanother. I possessed some excellent Barbs descended from a pair which\r\nhad won a prize, and another lot descended from a stock formerly kept\r\nby that famous fancier Sir John Sebright, and these plainly differed in\r\nthe form of the beak; but the differences were so slight that they\r\ncould hardly be given by words. Again, the common English and Dutch\r\nTumbler differ in a somewhat greater degree, both in length of beak and\r\nshape of head. What first caused these slight differences cannot be\r\nexplained any more than why one man has a long nose and another a short\r\none. In the strains long kept distinct by different fanciers, such\r\ndifferences are so common that they cannot be accounted for by the\r\naccident of the birds first chosen for breeding having been originally\r\nas different as they now are. The explanation no doubt lies in\r\nselection of a slightly different nature having been applied in each\r\ncase; for no two fanciers have exactly the same taste, and consequently\r\nno two, in choosing and carefully matching their birds, prefer or\r\nselect exactly the same. As each man naturally admires his own birds,\r\nhe goes on continually exaggerating by selection whatever slight\r\npeculiarities they may possess. This will more especially happen with\r\nfanciers living in different countries, who do not compare their stocks\r\nor aim at a common standard of perfection. Thus, when a mere strain has\r\nonce been formed, unconscious selection steadily tends to augment the\r\namount of difference, and thus converts the strain into a sub-breed and\r\nthis ultimately into a well-marked breed or race.\r\n\r\nThe principle of correlation of growth should never be lost sight of.\r\nMost pigeons have small feet, apparently caused by their lessened use,\r\nand from correlation, as it would appear, their beaks have likewise\r\nbecome reduced in length. The beak is a conspicuous organ, and, as soon\r\nas it had thus become perceptibly shortened, fanciers would almost\r\ncertainly strive to reduce it still more by the continued selection of\r\nbirds with the shortest beaks; whilst at the same time other fanciers,\r\nas we know has actually been the case, would in other sub-breeds,\r\nstrive to increase its length. With the increased length of the beak,\r\nthe tongue becomes greatly lengthened, as do the eyelids with the\r\nincreased development of the eye-wattles; with the reduced or increased\r\nsize of the feet, the number of the scutellæ vary; with the length of\r\nthe wing, the number of the primary wing-feathers differ; and with the\r\nincreased length of the body in the pouter the number of the sacral\r\nvertebræ is augmented. These important and correlated differences of\r\nstructure do not invariably characterise any breed; but if they had\r\nbeen attended to and selected with as much care as the more conspicuous\r\nexternal differences, there can hardly be a doubt that they would have\r\nbeen rendered constant. Fanciers could assuredly have made a race of\r\nTumblers with nine instead of ten primary wing-feathers, seeing how\r\noften the number nine appears without any wish on their part, and\r\nindeed in the case of the white-winged varieties in opposition to their\r\nwish. In a similar manner, if the vertebræ had been visible and had\r\nbeen attended to by fanciers, assuredly an additional number might\r\neasily have been fixed in the Pouter. If these latter characters had\r\nonce been rendered constant, we should never have suspected that they\r\nhad at first been highly variable, or that they had arisen from\r\ncorrelation, in the one case with the shortness of the wings, and in\r\nthe other case with the length of the body.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how the chief domestic races have become\r\ndistinctly separated from each other, it is important to bear in mind,\r\nthat fanciers constantly try to breed from the best birds, and\r\nconsequently that those which are inferior in the requisite qualities\r\nare in each generation neglected; so that after a time the less\r\nimproved parent-stocks and many subsequently formed intermediate grades\r\nbecome extinct. This has occurred in the case of the Pouter, Turbit,\r\nand Trumpeter, for these highly improved breeds are now left without\r\nany links closely connecting them either with each other or with the\r\naboriginal rock-pigeon. In other countries, indeed, where the same care\r\nhas not been applied, or where the same fashion has not prevailed, the\r\nearlier forms may long remain unaltered, or altered only in a slight\r\ndegree, and we are thus sometimes enabled to recover the connecting\r\nlinks. This is the case in Persia and India with the Tumbler and\r\nCarrier, which there differ but slightly from the rock-pigeon in the\r\nproportions of their beaks. So again in Java, the Fantail sometimes has\r\nonly fourteen caudal feathers, and the tail is much less elevated and\r\nexpanded than in our improved birds; so that the Java bird forms a link\r\nbetween a first-rate Fantail and the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a breed may be retained for some particular quality in a\r\nnearly unaltered condition in the same country, together with highly\r\nmodified off-shoots or sub-breeds, which are valued for some distinct\r\nproperty. We see this exemplified in England, where the common Tumbler,\r\nwhich is valued only for its flight, does not differ much from its\r\nparent-form, the Eastern Tumbler; whereas the Short-faced Tumbler has\r\nbeen prodigiously modified, from being valued, not for its flight, but\r\nfor other qualities. But the common-flying Tumbler of Europe has\r\nalready begun to branch out into slightly different sub-breeds, such as\r\nthe common English Tumbler, the Dutch Roller, the Glasgow\r\nHouse-tumbler, and the Long-faced Beard Tumbler, etc.; and in the\r\ncourse of centuries, unless fashions greatly change, these sub-breeds\r\nwill diverge through the slow and insensible process of unconscious\r\nselection, and become modified, in a greater and greater degree. After\r\na time the perfectly graduated links which now connect all these\r\nsub-breeds together, will be lost, for there would be no object and\r\nmuch difficulty in retaining such a host of intermediate sub-varieties.\r\n\r\nThe principle of divergence, together with the extinction of the many\r\npreviously existing intermediate forms, is so important for\r\nunderstanding the origin of domestic races, as well as of species in a\r\nstate of nature, that I will enlarge a little more on this subject. Our\r\nthird main group includes Carriers, Barbs, and Runts, which are plainly\r\nrelated to one another, yet wonderfully distinct in several important\r\ncharacters. According to the view given in the last chapter, these\r\nthree races have probably descended from an unknown race having an\r\nintermediate character, and this race from the rock-pigeon. Their\r\ncharacteristic differences are believed to be due to different breeders\r\nhaving at an early period admired different points of structure; and\r\nthen, on the acknowledged principle of admiring extremes, having gone\r\non breeding, without any thought of the future, as good birds as they\r\ncould,—Carrier-fanciers preferring long beaks with much\r\nwattle,—Barb-fanciers preferring short thick beaks with much\r\neye-wattle,—and Runt-fanciers not caring about the beak or wattle, but\r\nonly for the size and weight of the body. This process would have led\r\nto the neglect and final extinction of the earlier, inferior, and\r\nintermediate birds; and thus it has come to pass, that in Europe these\r\nthree races are now so extraordinarily distinct from each other. But in\r\nthe East, whence they were originally brought, the fashion has been\r\ndifferent, and we there see breeds which connect the highly modified\r\nEnglish Carrier with the rock-pigeon, and others which to a certain\r\nextent connect Carriers and Runts. Looking back to the time of\r\nAldrovandi, we find that there existed in Europe, before the year 1600,\r\nfour breeds which were closely allied to Carriers and Barbs, but which\r\ncompetent authorities cannot now identify with our present Barbs and\r\nCarriers; nor can Aldrovandi’s Runts be identified with our present\r\nRunts. These four breeds certainly did not differ from each other\r\nnearly so much as do our existing English Carriers, Barbs, and Runts.\r\nAll this is exactly what might have been anticipated. If we could\r\ncollect all the pigeons which have ever lived, from before the time of\r\nthe Romans to the present day, we should be able to group them in\r\nseveral lines, diverging from the parent rock-pigeon. Each line would\r\nconsist of almost insensible steps, occasionally broken by some\r\nslightly greater variation or sport, and each would culminate in one of\r\nour present highly modified forms. Of the many former connecting links,\r\nsome would be found to have become absolutely extinct without having\r\nleft any issue, whilst others, though extinct, would be recognised as\r\nthe progenitors of the existing races.\r\n\r\nI have heard it remarked as a strange circumstance that we occasionally\r\nhear of the local or complete extinction of domestic races, whilst we\r\nhear nothing of their origin. How, it has been asked, can these losses\r\nbe compensated, and more than compensated, for we know that with almost\r\nall domesticated animals the races have largely increased in number\r\nsince the time of the Romans? But on the view here given, we can\r\nunderstand this apparent contradiction. The extinction of a race within\r\nhistorical times is an event likely to be noticed; but its gradual and\r\nscarcely sensible modification through unconscious selection, and its\r\nsubsequent divergence, either in the same or more commonly in distant\r\ncountries, into two or more strains, and their gradual conversion into\r\nsub-breeds, and these into well- marked breeds are events which would\r\nrarely be noticed. The death of a tree, that has attained gigantic\r\ndimensions, is recorded; the slow growth of smaller trees and their\r\nincrease in number excite no attention.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the belief in the great power of selection, and of\r\nthe little direct power of changed conditions of life, except in\r\ncausing general variability or plasticity of organisation, it is not\r\nsurprising that dovecot-pigeons have remained unaltered from time\r\nimmemorial; and that some toy-pigeons, which differ in little else\r\nbesides colour from the dovecot-pigeon, have retained the same\r\ncharacter for several centuries. For when one of these toy-pigeons had\r\nonce become beautifully and symmetrically coloured,—when, for instance,\r\na Spot had been produced with the crown of its head, its tail, and\r\ntail-coverts of a uniform colour, the rest of the body being\r\nsnow-white,—no alteration or improvement would be desired. On the other\r\nhand, it is not surprising that during this same interval of time our\r\nhighly-bred pigeons have undergone an astonishing amount of change; for\r\nin regard to them there is no defined limit to the wish of the fancier,\r\nand there is no known limit to the variability of their characters.\r\nWhat is there to stop the fancier desiring to give to his Carrier a\r\nlonger and longer beak, or to his Tumbler a shorter and shorter beak?\r\nnor has the extreme limit of variability in the beak, if there be any\r\nsuch limit, as yet been reached. Notwithstanding the great improvement\r\neffected within recent times in the Short-faced Almond Tumbler, Mr.\r\nEaton remarks, “the field is still as open for fresh competitors as it\r\nwas one hundred years ago;” but this is perhaps an exaggerated\r\nassertion, for the young of all highly-improved fancy birds are\r\nextremely liable to disease and death.\r\n\r\nI have heard it objected that the formation of the several domestic\r\nraces of the pigeon throws no light on the origin of the wild species\r\nof the Columbidæ, because their differences are not of the same nature.\r\nThe domestic races, for instance do not differ, or differ hardly at\r\nall, in the relative lengths and shape of the primary wing-feathers, in\r\nthe relative length of the hind toe, or in habits of life, as in\r\nroosting and building in trees. But the above objection shows how\r\ncompletely the principle of selection has been misunderstood. It is not\r\nlikely that characters selected by the caprice of man should resemble\r\ndifferences preserved under natural conditions either from being of\r\ndirect service to each species, or from standing in correlation with\r\nother modified and serviceable structures. Until man selects birds\r\ndiffering in the relative length of the wing-feathers or toes, etc., no\r\nsensible change in these parts should be expected. Nor could man do\r\nanything unless these parts happened to vary under domestication: I do\r\nnot positively assert that this is the case, although I have seen\r\ntraces of such variability in the wing-feathers, and certainly in the\r\ntail-feathers. It would be a strange fact if the relative length of the\r\nhind toe should never vary, seeing how variable the foot is both in\r\nsize and in the number of the scutellæ. With respect to the domestic\r\nraces not roosting or building in trees, it is obvious that fanciers\r\nwould never attend to or select such changes in habits; but we have\r\nseen that the pigeons in Egypt, which do not for some reason like\r\nsettling on the low mud hovels of the natives, are led, apparently by\r\ncompulsion, to perch in crowds on the trees. We may even affirm that,\r\nif our domestic races had become greatly modified in any of the above\r\nspecified respects, and it could be shown that fanciers had never\r\nattended to such points, or that they did not stand in correlation with\r\nother selected characters, the fact, on the principles advocated in\r\nthis chapter, would have offered a serious difficulty.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly sum up the last two chapters on the pigeon. We may\r\nconclude with confidence that all the domestic races, notwithstanding\r\ntheir great amount of difference, are descended from the _Columba\r\nlivia,_ including under this name certain wild races. But the\r\ndifferences between the latter throw no light whatever on the\r\ncharacters which distinguish the domestic races. In each breed or\r\nsub-breed the individual birds are more variable than birds in a state\r\nof nature; and occasionally they vary in a sudden and strongly-marked\r\nmanner. This plasticity of organisation apparently results from changed\r\nconditions of life. Disuse has reduced certain parts of the body.\r\nCorrelation of growth so ties the organisation together, that when one\r\npart varies other parts vary at the same time. When several breeds have\r\nonce been formed, their intercrossing aids the progress of\r\nmodification, and has even produced new sub-breeds. But as, in the\r\nconstruction of a building, mere stones or bricks are of little avail\r\nwithout the builder’s art, so, in the production of new races,\r\nselection has been the presiding power. Fanciers can act by selection\r\non excessively slight individual differences, as well as on those\r\ngreater differences which are called sports. Selection is followed\r\nmethodically when the fancier tries to improve and modify a breed\r\naccording to a prefixed standard of excellence; or he acts\r\nunmethodically and unconsciously, by merely trying to rear as good\r\nbirds as he can, without any wish or intention to alter the breed. The\r\nprogress of selection almost inevitably leads to the neglect and\r\nultimate extinction of the earlier and less improved forms, as well as\r\nof many intermediate links in each long line of descent. Thus it has\r\ncome to pass that most of our present races are so marvellously\r\ndistinct from each other, and from the aboriginal rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Temminck ‘Hist. Nat.

With respect to fowls I will give the references in the\r\n next chapter.\r\n\r\n [19] I have drawn out a long table of the various crosses made by\r\n fanciers between the several domestic breeds but I do not think it\r\n worth while publishing. I have myself made for this special purpose\r\n many crosses, and all were perfectly fertile. I have united in one\r\n bird five of the most distinct races, and with patience I might\r\n undoubtedly have thus united all. The case of five distinct breeds\r\n being blended together with unimpaired fertility is important, because\r\n Gärtner has shown that it is a very general, though not, as he\r\n thought, universal rule, that complex crosses between several species\r\n are excessively sterile. I have met with only two or three cases of\r\n reported sterility in the offspring of certain races when crossed.\r\n Pistor (‘Das Ganze der Feldtaubenzucht,’ 1831, s. 15) asserts that the\r\n mongrels from Barbs and Fantails are sterile: I have proved this to be\r\n erroneous, not only by crossing those hybrids with several other\r\n hybrids of the same parentage, but by the more severe test of pairing\r\n brother and sister hybrids _inter se,_ and they were _perfectly_\r\n fertile. Temminck has stated (‘Hist. Nat. Gén. des Pigeons,’ tom. i.\r\n p. 197) that the Turbit or Owl will not cross readily with other\r\n breeds: but my Turbits crossed, when left free with Almond Tumblers\r\n and with Trumpeters; the same thing has occurred (Rev. E. S. Dixon,\r\n ‘The Dovecote,’ p. 107) between Turbits and Dovecots and Nuns. I have\r\n crossed Turbits with Barbs, as has M. Boitard (p. 34), who says the\r\n hybrids were very fertile. Hybrids from a Turbit and Fantail have been\r\n known to breed _inter se_ (Riedel, ‘Taubenzucht,’ s. 25, and\r\n Bechstein, ‘Naturgesch. Deutsch.,’ B. iv. s. 44. Turbits (Riedel, s.\r\n 26) have been crossed with Pouters and with Jacobins, and with a\r\n hybrid Jacobin-trumpeter (Riedel, s. 27). The latter author has,\r\n however, made some vague statements (s. 22) on the sterility of\r\n Turbits when crossed with certain other crossed breeds. But I have\r\n little doubt that the Rev. E. S. Dixon’s explanation of such\r\n statements is correct, viz. that individual birds both with Turbits\r\n and other breeds are occasionally sterile.\r\n\r\n [20] ‘Das Ganze der Taubenzucht,’ s. 18.\r\n\r\n [21] ‘Les Pigeons,’ etc., p. 35.\r\n\r\n [22] Domestic pigeons pair readily with the allied _C. œnas_\r\n (Bechstein, ‘Naturgesch. Deutschlands,’ B. iv. s. 3); and Mr. Brent\r\n has made the same cross several times in England, but the young were\r\n very apt to die at about ten days old; one hybrid which he reared\r\n (from _C. œnas_ and a male Antwerp Carrier) paired with a Dragon, but\r\n never laid eggs. Bechstein further states (s. 26) that the domestic\r\n pigeon will cross with _C. palumbus, Turtur risoria,_ and _T.\r\n vulgaris,_ but nothing is said of the fertility of the hybrids, and\r\n this would have been mentioned had the fact been ascertained. In the\r\n Zoological Gardens (MS. report to me from Mr. James Hunt) a male\r\n hybrid from _Turtur vulgaris_ and a domestic pigeon “paired with\r\n several different species of pigeons and doves, but none of the eggs\r\n were good.” Hybrids from _C. œnas_ and _gymnophthalmos_ were sterile.\r\n In Loudon’s ‘Mag. of Nat. Hist.,’ vol. vii. 1834, p. 154, it is said\r\n that a male hybrid (from _Turtur vulgaris_ male, and the\r\n cream-coloured _T. risoria_ female) paired during two years with a\r\n female _T. risoria,_ and the latter laid many eggs, but all were\r\n sterile. MM. Boitard and Corbié (‘Les Pigeons,’ p. 235) state that the\r\n hybrids from these two turtle-doves are invariably sterile both _inter\r\n se_ and with either pure parent. The experiment was tried by M. Corbié\r\n “avec une espèce d’obstination;” and likewise by M. Mauduyt, and by M.\r\n Vieillot. Temminck also found the hybrids from these two species quite\r\n barren. Therefore, when Bechstein (‘Naturgesch. Deutschlands Vögel,’\r\n B. iv. s. 101) asserts that the hybrids from these two turtle-doves\r\n propagate _inter se_ equally well with pure species, and when a writer\r\n in the ‘Field’ newspaper (in a letter dated Nov. 10th, 1858) makes a\r\n similar assertion, it would appear that there must be some mistake;\r\n though what the mistake is I know not, as Bechstein at least must have\r\n known the white _variety_ of _T. risoria_: it would be an unparalleled\r\n fact if the same two species sometimes produced _extremely_ fertile,\r\n and sometimes _extremely_ barren, offspring. In the MS. report from\r\n the Zoological Gardens it is said that hybrids from _Turtur vulgaris_\r\n and _ suratensis,_ and from _T. vulgaris_ and _Ectopistes\r\n migratorius,_ were sterile. Two of the latter male hybrids paired with\r\n their pure parents, viz. _Turtur vulgaris_ and the Ectopistes, and\r\n likewise with _T. risoria_ and with _ Columba œnas,_ and many eggs\r\n were produced, but all were barren. At Paris, hybrids have been raised\r\n (Isid. Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire, ‘Hist. Nat. Générale,’ tom. iii. p.\r\n 180) from _Turtur auritus_ with _T. cambayensis_ and with _T.\r\n suratensis_; but nothing is said of their fertility. At the Zoological\r\n Gardens of London the _Goura coronata_ and _victoriæ_ produced a\r\n hybrid which paired with the pure _G. coronata,_ and laid several\r\n eggs, but these proved barren. In 1860 _Columba gymnophthalmos_ and\r\n _maculosa_ produced hybrids in these same gardens.\r\n\r\n [23] There is one exception to the rule, namely, in a sub-variety of\r\n the Swallow of German origin, which is figured by Neumeister, and was\r\n shown to me by Mr. Wicking. This bird is blue, but has not the black\r\n wing-bars; for our object, however, in tracing the descent of the\r\n chief races, this exception signifies the less as the Swallow\r\n approaches closely in structure to _C. livia._ In many sub-varieties\r\n the black bars are replaced by bars of various colours. The figures\r\n given by Neumeister are sufficient to show that, if the wings alone\r\n are blue, the black wing-bars appear.\r\n\r\n [24] I have observed blue birds with all the above-mentioned marks in\r\n the following races, which seemed to be perfectly pure, and were shown\r\n at various exhibitions. Pouters, with the double black wing-bars, with\r\n white croup, dark bar to end of tail, and white edging to outer\r\n tail-feathers. Turbits, with all these same characters. Fantails with\r\n the same; but the croup in some was bluish or pure blue. Mr. Wicking\r\n bred blue Fantails from two black birds. Carriers (including the\r\n Bagadotten of Neumeister) with all the marks: two birds which I\r\n examined had white, and two had blue croups; the white edging to the\r\n outer tail-feathers was not present in all. Mr. Corker, a great\r\n breeder, assures me that, if black carriers are matched for many\r\n successive generations, the offspring become first ash-coloured, and\r\n then blue with black wing-bars. Runts of the elongated breed had the\r\n same marks, but the croup was pale blue; the outer tail-feathers had\r\n white edges. Neumeister figures the great Florence Runt of a blue\r\n colour with black bars. Jacobins are very rarely blue, but I have\r\n received authentic accounts of at least two instances of the blue\r\n variety with black bars having appeared in England; blue Jacobins were\r\n bred by Mr. Brent from two black birds. I have seen common Tumblers,\r\n both Indian and English, and Short-faced Tumblers, of a blue colour,\r\n with black wing-bars, with the black bar at the end of the tail, and\r\n with the outer tail-feathers edged with white; the croup in all was\r\n blue, or extremely pale blue, never absolutely white. Blue Barbs and\r\n Trumpeters seem to be excessively rare; but Neumeister, who may be\r\n implicitly trusted, figures blue varieties of both, with black\r\n wing-bars. Mr. Brent informs me that he has seen a blue Barb; and Mr.\r\n H. Weir, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, once bred a silver (which\r\n means very pale blue) Barb from two yellow birds.\r\n\r\n [25] Mr. Blyth informs me that all the domestic races in India have\r\n the croup blue; but this is not invariable, for I possess a very pale\r\n blue Simmali pigeon with the croup perfectly white, sent to me by Sir\r\n W. Elliot from Madras. A slaty-blue and chequered Nakshi pigeon has\r\n some white feathers on the croup alone. In some other Indian pigeons\r\n there were a few white feathers confined to the croup, and I have\r\n noticed the same fact in a carrier from Persia. The Java Fantail\r\n (imported into Amoy, and thence sent me) has a perfectly white croup.\r\n\r\n [26] ‘Les Pigeons,’ etc., p. 37.\r\n\r\n [27] ‘Treatise on Pigeons,’ 1858, p. 145.\r\n\r\n [28] J. Moore’s ‘Columbarium,’ 1735; in J. M. Eaton’s edition, 1852,\r\n p. 71.\r\n\r\n [29] I could give numerous examples; two will suffice. A mongrel,\r\n whose four grandparents were a white Turbit, white Trumpeter, white\r\n Fantail, and blue Pouter, was white all over, except a very few\r\n feathers about the head and on the wings, but the whole tail and\r\n tail-coverts were dark bluish-grey. Another mongrel whose four\r\n grandparents were a red Runt, white Trumpeter, white Fantail, and the\r\n same blue Pouter, was pure white all over, except the tail and upper\r\n tail-coverts, which were pale fawn, and except the faintest trace of\r\n double wing-bars of the same pale fawn tint.\r\n\r\n [30] It deserves notice, as bearing on the general subject of\r\n variation, that not only _C. livia_ presents several wild forms,\r\n regarded by some naturalists as species and by others as sub-species\r\n or as mere varieties, but that the species of several allied genera\r\n are in the same predicament. This is the case, as Mr. Blyth has\r\n remarked to me, with Treron, Palumbus, and Turtur.\r\n\r\n [31] ‘Denkmäler,’ Abth. ii. Bl. 70.\r\n\r\n [32] ‘The ‘Dovecote,’ by the Rev. E. S. Dixon, 1851, pp. 11-13.\r\n Adolphe Pictet (in his ‘Les Origines Indo-Européennes,’ 1859, p. 399)\r\n states that there are in the ancient Sanscrit language between 25 and\r\n 30 names for the pigeon, and other 15 or 16 Persian names; none of\r\n these are common to the European languages. This fact indicates the\r\n antiquity of the domestication of the pigeon in the East.\r\n\r\n [33] English translation, 1601, Book x. ch. xxxvii.\r\n\r\n [34] ‘Ayeen Akbery,’ translated by F.

The following discussion on the origin\r\n    of the various breeds and on their characteristic differences does\r\n    not pretend to completeness, but may be of some interest to the\r\n    naturalist. The classification of the breeds cannot, as far as I\r\n    can see, be made natural. They differ from each other in different\r\n    degrees, and do not afford characters in subordination to each\r\n    other, by which they can be ranked in group under group. They seem\r\n    all to have diverged by independent and different roads from a\r\n    single type. Each chief breed includes differently coloured\r\n    sub-varieties, most of which can be truly propagated, but it would\r\n    be superfluous to describe them. I have classed the various crested\r\n    fowls as sub-breeds under the Polish fowl; but I have great doubts\r\n    whether this is a natural arrangement, showing true affinity or\r\n    blood relationship. It is scarcely possible to avoid laying stress\r\n    on the commonness of a breed; and if certain foreign sub-breeds had\r\n    been largely kept in this country they would perhaps have been\r\n    raised to the rank of main-breeds. Several breeds are abnormal in\r\n    character; that is, they differ in certain points from all wild\r\n    Gallinaceous birds. At first I made a division of the breeds into\r\n    normal and abnormal, but the result was wholly unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n1. GAME BREED.—This may be considered as the typical breed, as it\r\ndeviates only slightly from the wild _Gallus bankiva,_ or, as perhaps\r\nmore correctly named, _ferrugineus._ Beak strong; comb single and\r\nupright. Spurs long and sharp. Feathers closely appressed to the body.\r\nTail with the normal number of 14 feathers. Eggs often pale buff.\r\nDisposition indomitably courageous, exhibited even in the hens and\r\nchickens. An unusual number of differently coloured varieties exist,\r\nsuch as black and brown-breasted reds, duckwings, blacks, whites,\r\npiles, etc., with their legs of various colours.\r\n\r\n2. MALAY BREED.—Body of great size, with head, neck, and legs\r\nelongated; carriage erect; tail small, sloping downwards, generally\r\nformed of 16 feathers; comb and wattle small; ear-lobe and face red;\r\nskin yellowish; feathers closely appressed to the body; neck-hackles\r\nshort, narrow, and hard. Eggs often pale buff. Chickens feather late.\r\nDisposition savage. Of Eastern origin.\r\n\r\n3. COCHIN, OR SHANGAI BREED.—Size great; wing feathers short, arched,\r\nmuch hidden in the soft downy plumage; barely capable of flight; tail\r\nshort, generally formed of 16 feathers, developed at a late period in\r\nthe young males; legs thick, feathered; spurs short, thick; nail of\r\nmiddle toe flat and broad; an additional toe not rarely developed; skin\r\nyellowish. Comb and wattle well developed. Skull with deep medial\r\nfurrow; occipital foramen, sub-triangular, vertically elongated. Voice\r\npeculiar. Eggs rough, buff-coloured. Disposition extremely quiet. Of\r\nChinese origin.\r\n\r\n4. DORKING BREED.—Size great; body square, compact; feet with an\r\nadditional toe; comb well developed, but varies much in form; wattles\r\nwell developed; colour of plumage various. Skull remarkably broad\r\nbetween the orbits. Of English origin.\r\n\r\nThe white Dorking may be considered as a distinct sub-breed, being a\r\nless massive bird.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 30—Spanish Fowl\r\n\r\n5. SPANISH BREED (fig. 30).—Tall, with stately carriage; tarsi long;\r\ncomb single, deeply serrated, of immense size; wattles largely\r\ndeveloped; the large ear-lobes and sides of face white. Plumage black\r\nglossed with green. Do not incubate. Tender in constitution, the comb\r\nbeing often injured by frost. Eggs white, smooth, of large size.\r\nChickens feather late but the young cocks show their masculine\r\ncharacters, and crow at an early age. Of Mediterranean origin.\r\n\r\nThe _Andalusians_ may be ranked as a sub-breed: they are of a\r\nslaty-blue colour, and their chickens are well feathered. A smaller,\r\nshort-legged Dutch sub-breed has been described by some authors as\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 31—Hamburgh Fowl\r\n\r\n6. HAMBURGH BREED (fig 31).—Size moderate; comb flat, produced\r\nbackwards, covered with numerous small points; wattle of moderate\r\ndimensions; ear lobe white; legs blueish, thin. Do not incubate. Skull,\r\nwith the tips of the ascending branches of the premaxillary and with\r\nthe nasal bones standing a little separate from each other; anterior\r\nmargin of the frontal bones less depressed than usual.\r\n\r\nThere are two sub-breeds; the _ spangled_ Hamburgh, of English origin,\r\nwith the tips of the feathers marked with a dark spot; and the\r\n_pencilled_ Hamburgh, of Dutch origin, with dark transverse lines\r\nacross each feather, and with the body rather smaller. Both these\r\nsub-breeds include gold and silver varieties, as well as some other\r\nsub-varieties. Black Hamburghs have been produced by a cross with the\r\nSpanish breed.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 32—Polish Fowl\r\n\r\n7. CRESTED OR POLISH BREED (fig 32).—Head with a large, rounded crest\r\nof feathers, supported on a hemispherical protuberance of the frontal\r\nbones, which includes the anterior part of the brain. The ascending\r\nbranches of premaxillary bones and the inner nasal processes are much\r\nshortened. The orifice of the nostrils raised and crescentic. Beak\r\nshort. Comb absent, or small and of crescentic shape; wattles either\r\npresent or replaced by a beard-like tuft of feathers. Legs leaden-blue.\r\nSexual differences appear late in life. Do not incubate. There are\r\nseveral beautiful varieties which differ in colour and slightly in\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\nThe following sub-breeds agree in having a crest, more or less\r\ndeveloped, with the comb, when present, of crescentic shape. The skull\r\npresents nearly the same remarkable peculiarities of structure as in\r\nthe true Polish fowl.\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed _(a) Sultans._—A Turkish breed, resembling white Polish\r\n    fowls with a large crest and beard with short and well-feathered\r\n    legs. The tail is furnished with additional sickle feathers. Do not\r\n    incubate.[2]\r\n\r\nSub-breed _(b) Ptarmigans._—An inferior breed closely allied to the\r\nlast, white, rather small, legs much feathered, with the crest pointed;\r\ncomb small, cupped; wattles small.\r\n\r\nSub-breed _(c) Ghoondooks._—Another Turkish breed having an\r\nextraordinary appearance; black and tailless; crest and beard large;\r\nlegs feathered. The inner processes of the two nasal bones come into\r\ncontact with each other, owing to the complete abortion of the\r\nascending branches of the premaxillaries. I have seen an allied white,\r\ntailless breed from Turkey.\r\n\r\nSub-breed _(d) Crève-cœur._—A French breed of large size, barely\r\ncapable of flight, with short black legs, head crested, comb produced\r\ninto two points or horns, sometimes a little branched like the horns of\r\na stag; both beard and wattles present. Eggs large. Disposition\r\nquiet.[3]\r\n\r\nSub-breed _(e) Horned fowl._—With a small crest; comb produced into two\r\ngreat points, supported on two bony protuberances.\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed _(f) Houdan._—A French breed; of moderate size,\r\n    short-legged with five toes, well developed; plumage invariably\r\n    mottled with black, white, and straw-yellow; head furnished with a\r\n    crest, on a triple comb placed transversely; both wattles and beard\r\n    present.[4]\r\n\r\nSub-breed _(g) Guelderlands._—No comb, head said to be surmounted by a\r\nlongitudinal crest of soft velvety feathers; nostrils said to be\r\ncrescentic; wattles well developed; legs feathered; colour black. From\r\nNorth America. The Breda fowl seems to be closely allied to the\r\nGuelderland.\r\n\r\n8. BANTAM BREED.—Originally from Japan[5] characterised by small size\r\nalone; carriage bold and erect. There are several sub-breeds, such as\r\nthe Cochin, Game, and Sebright Bantams, some of which have been\r\nrecently formed by various crosses. The Black Bantam has a differently\r\nshaped skull, with the occipital foramen like that of the Cochin fowl.\r\n\r\n    9. RUMPLESS FOWLS.—These are so variable in character[6] that they\r\n    hardly deserve to be called a breed. Any one who will examine the\r\n    caudal vertebræ will see how monstrous the breed is.\r\n\r\n10. CREEPERS OR JUMPERS.—These are characterised by an almost monstrous\r\nshortness of legs, so that they move by jumping rather than by walking;\r\nthey are said not to scratch up the ground. I have examined a Burmese\r\nvariety, which had a skull of rather unusual shape.\r\n\r\n11. FRIZZLED OR CAFFRE FOWLS.—Not uncommon in India, with the feathers\r\ncurling backwards, and with the primary feathers of the wing and tail\r\nimperfect; periosteum of bones black.\r\n\r\n12. SILK FOWLS.—Feathers silky, with the primary wing and tail-feathers\r\nimperfect; skin and periosteum of bones black; comb and wattles dark\r\nleaden-blue; ear-lappets tinged with blue; legs thin, often furnished\r\nwith an additional toe. Size rather small.\r\n\r\n13. SOOTY FOWLS.—An Indian breed, having the peculiar appearance of a\r\nwhite bird smeared with soot, with black skin and periosteum. The hens\r\nalone are thus characterised.\r\n\r\n    From this synopsis we see that the several breeds differ\r\n    considerably, and they would have been nearly as interesting for us\r\n    as pigeons, if there had been equally good evidence that all had\r\n    descended from one parent-species. Most fanciers believe that they\r\n    are descended from several primitive stocks. The Rev. E. S.\r\n    Dixon[7] argues strongly on this side of the question; and one\r\n    fancier even denounces the opposite conclusion by asking, “Do we\r\n    not perceive pervading this spirit, the spirit of the _Deist_?”\r\n    Most naturalists, with the exception of a few, such as Temminck,\r\n    believe that all the breeds have proceeded from a single species;\r\n    but authority on such a point goes for little. Fanciers look to all\r\n    parts of the world as the possible sources of their unknown stocks;\r\n    thus ignoring the laws of geographical distribution. They know well\r\n    that the several kinds breed truly even in colour. They assert,\r\n    but, as we shall see, on very weak grounds, that most of the breeds\r\n    are extremely ancient. They are strongly impressed with the great\r\n    difference between the chief kinds, and they ask with force, can\r\n    differences in climate, food, or treatment have produced birds so\r\n    different as the black stately Spanish, the diminutive elegant\r\n    Bantam, the heavy Cochin with its many peculiarities, and the\r\n    Polish fowl with its great top-knot and protuberant skull? But\r\n    fanciers, whilst admitting and even overrating the effects of\r\n    crossing the various breeds, do not sufficiently regard the\r\n    probability of the occasional birth, during the course of\r\n    centuries, of birds with abnormal and hereditary peculiarities;\r\n    they overlook the effects of correlation of growth—of the\r\n    long-continued use and disuse of parts, and of some direct result\r\n    from changed food and climate, though on this latter head I have\r\n    found no sufficient evidence; and lastly, they all, as far as I\r\n    know, entirely overlook the all-important subject of unconscious or\r\n    unmethodical selection, though they are well aware that their birds\r\n    differ individually and that by selecting the best birds for a few\r\n    generations they can improve their stocks.\r\n\r\n    An amateur writes[8] as follows: “The fact that poultry have until\r\n    lately received but little attention at the hands of the fancier,\r\n    and been entirely confined to the domains of the producer for the\r\n    market, would alone suggest the improbability of that constant and\r\n    unremitting attention having been observed in breeding, which is\r\n    requisite to the consummating in the offspring of any two birds\r\n    transmittable forms not exhibited by the parents.” This at first\r\n    sight appears true. But in a future chapter on Selection, abundant\r\n    facts will be given showing not only that careful breeding, but\r\n    that actual selection was practised during ancient periods, and by\r\n    barely civilised races of man. In the case of the fowl I can adduce\r\n    no direct facts showing that selection was anciently practised; but\r\n    the Romans at the commencement of the Christian era kept six or\r\n    seven breeds, and Columella “particularly recommends as the best,\r\n    those sorts that have five toes and white ears.”[9] In the\r\n    fifteenth century several breeds were known and described in\r\n    Europe; and in China, at nearly the same period, seven kinds were\r\n    named. A more striking case is that at present, in one of the\r\n    Philippine Islands, the semi-barbarous inhabitants have distinct\r\n    native names for no less than nine sub-breeds of the Game fowl.[10]\r\n    Azara,[11] who wrote towards the close of the last century, states\r\n    that in the interior parts of South America, where I should not\r\n    have expected that the least care would have been taken of poultry,\r\n    a black-skinned and black-boned breed is kept, from being\r\n    considered fertile and its flesh good for sick persons. Now every\r\n    one who has kept poultry knows how impossible it is to keep several\r\n    breeds distinct unless the utmost care be taken in separating the\r\n    sexes. Will it then be pretended that those persons who, in ancient\r\n    times and in semi-civilised countries took pains to keep the breeds\r\n    distinct, and who therefore valued them, would not occasionally\r\n    have destroyed inferior birds and occasionally have preserved their\r\n    best birds? This is all that is required. It is not pretended that\r\n    any one in ancient times intended to form a new breed, or to modify\r\n    an old breed according to some ideal standard of excellence. He who\r\n    cared for poultry would merely wish to obtain, and afterwards to\r\n    rear, the best birds which he could; but this occasional\r\n    preservation of the best birds would in the course of time modify\r\n    the breed, as surely, though by no means as rapidly, as does\r\n    methodical selection at the present day, If one person out of a\r\n    hundred or out of a thousand attended to the breeding of his birds,\r\n    this would be sufficient; for the birds thus tended would soon\r\n    become superior to others, and would form a new strain; and this\r\n    strain would, as explained in the last chapter, slowly have its\r\n    characteristic differences augmented, and at last be converted into\r\n    a new sub-breed or breed. But breeds would often be for a time\r\n    neglected and would deteriorate; they would, however, partially\r\n    retain their character, and afterwards might again come into\r\n    fashion and be raised to a standard of perfection higher than their\r\n    former standard; as has actually occurred quite recently with\r\n    Polish fowls. If, however, a breed were utterly neglected, it would\r\n    become extinct, as has recently happened with one of the Polish\r\n    sub-breeds. Whenever in the course of past centuries a bird\r\n    appeared with some slight abnormal structure, such as with a\r\n    lark-like crest on its head, it would probably often have been\r\n    preserved from that love of novelty which leads some persons in\r\n    England to keep rumpless fowls, and others in India to keep\r\n    frizzled fowls. And after a time any such abnormal appearance would\r\n    be carefully preserved, from being esteemed a sign of the purity\r\n    and excellence of the breed; for on this principle the Romans\r\n    eighteen centuries ago valued the fifth toe and the white ear-lobe\r\n    in their fowls.\r\n\r\n Thus from the occasional appearance of abnormal characters, though at\r\n first only slight in degree; from the effects of the use and the\r\n disuse of parts; possibly from the direct effects of changed climate\r\n and food; from correlation of growth; from occasional reversions to\r\n old and long-lost characters; from the crossing of breeds, when more\r\n than one had been formed; but, above all, from unconscious selection\r\n carried on during many generations, there is no insuperable\r\n difficulty, to the best of my judgment, in believing that all the\r\n breeds have descended from some one parent-source. Can any single\r\n species be named from which we may reasonably suppose that all are\r\n descended? The Gallus bankiva apparently fulfils every requirement. I\r\n have already given as fair an account as I could of the arguments in\r\n favour of the multiple origin of the several breeds; and now I will\r\n give those in favour of their common descent from _G. bankiva._\r\n\r\n    But it will be convenient first briefly to describe all the known\r\n    species of Gallus. The _G. sonneratii_ does not range into the\r\n    northern parts of India; according to Colonel Sykes,[12] it\r\n    presents at different heights of the Ghauts, two strongly marked\r\n    varieties, perhaps deserving to be called species. It was at one\r\n    time thought to be the primitive stock of all our domestic breeds,\r\n    and this shows that it closely approaches the common fowl in\r\n    general structure; but its hackles partially consist of highly\r\n    peculiar, horny laminæ, transversely banded with three colours; and\r\n    I have met no authentic account of any such character having been\r\n    observed in any domestic breed.[13] This species also differs\r\n    greatly from the common fowl, in the comb being finely serrated,\r\n    and in the loins being destitute of true hackles. Its voice is\r\n    utterly different. It crosses readily in India with domestic hens;\r\n    and Mr. Blyth[14] raised nearly 100 hybrid chickens; but they were\r\n    tender and mostly died whilst young. Those which were reared were\r\n    absolutely sterile when crossed inter se or with either parent. At\r\n    the Zoological Gardens, however, some ‘hybrids of the same\r\n    parentage were not quite so sterile: Mr. Dixon, as he informed me,\r\n    made, with Mr. Yarrell’s aid, particular inquiries on this subject,\r\n    and was assured that out of 50 eggs only five or six chickens were\r\n    reared. Some, however, of these half-bred birds were crossed with\r\n    one of their parents, namely, a Bantam, and produced a few\r\n    extremely feeble chickens. Mr. Dixon also procured some of these\r\n    same birds and crossed them in several ways, but all were more or\r\n    less infertile. Nearly similar experiments have recently been tried\r\n    on a great scale in the Zoological Gardens with almost the same\r\n    result.[15] Out of 500 eggs, raised from various first crosses and\r\n    hybrids, between _G. sonneratii, bankiva,_ and _varius,_ only 12\r\n    chickens were reared, and of these only three were the product of\r\n    hybrids _inter se._ From these facts, and from the above-mentioned\r\n    strongly-marked differences in structure between the domestic fowl\r\n    and _G. sonneratii,_ we may reject this latter species as the\r\n    parent of any domestic breed.\r\n\r\n    Ceylon possesses a fowl peculiar to the island, viz. _G.\r\n    stanleyii_; this species approaches so closely (except in the\r\n    colouring of the comb) to the domestic fowl, that Messrs. Layard\r\n    and Kellaert[16] would have considered it, as they inform me, as\r\n    one of the parent-stocks, had it not been for its singularly\r\n    different voice. This bird, like the last, crosses readily with\r\n    tame hens, and even visits solitary farms and ravishes them. Two\r\n    hybrids, a male and female, thus produced, were found by Mr.\r\n    Mitford to be quite sterile: both inherited the peculiar voice of\r\n    _G. stanleyii._ This species, then, may in all probability be\r\n    rejected as one of the primitive stocks of the domestic fowl.\r\n\r\n    Java and the islands eastward as far as Flores are inhabited by _G.\r\n    varius_ (or _furcatus_), which differs in so many characters—green\r\n    plumage, unserrated comb, and single median wattle—that no one\r\n    supposes it to have been the parent of any one of our breeds; yet,\r\n    as I am informed by Mr. Crawfurd,[17] hybrids are commonly raised\r\n    between the male _G. varius_ and the common hen, and are kept for\r\n    their great beauty, but are invariably sterile: this, however, was\r\n    not the case with some bred in the Zoological Gardens. These\r\n    hybrids were at one time thought to be specifically distinct, and\r\n    were named _G. æneus._ Mr. Blyth and others believe that the _G.\r\n    temminckii_[18] (of which the history is not known) is a similar\r\n    hybrid. Sir J. Brooke sent me some skins of domestic fowls from\r\n    Borneo, and across the tail of one of these, as Mr. Tegetmeier\r\n    observed, there were transverse blue bands like those which he had\r\n    seen on the tail-feathers of hybrids from _G. varius,_ reared in\r\n    the Zoological Gardens. This fact apparently indicates that some of\r\n    the fowls of Borneo have been slightly affected by crosses with _G.\r\n    varius,_ but the case may possibly be one of analogous variation. I\r\n    may just allude to the _G. giganteus,_ so often referred to in\r\n    works on poultry as a wild species; but Marsden[19] the first\r\n    describer, speaks of it as a tame breed; and the specimen in the\r\n    British Museum evidently has the aspect of a domestic variety.\r\n\r\n    The last species to be mentioned, namely, _Gallus bankiva,_ has a\r\n    much wider geographical range than the three previous species; it\r\n    inhabits Northern India as far west as Sinde, and ascends the\r\n    Himalaya to a height of 4000 ft.; it inhabits Burmah, the Malay\r\n    peninsula, the Indo-Chinese countries, the Philippine Islands, and\r\n    the Malayan archipelago as far eastward as Timor. This species\r\n    varies considerably in the wild state. Mr. Blyth informs me that\r\n    the specimens, both male and female, brought from near the\r\n    Himalaya, are rather paler coloured than those from other parts of\r\n    India; whilst those from the Malay peninsula and Java are brighter\r\n    coloured than the Indian birds. I have seen specimens from these\r\n    countries, and the difference of tint in the hackles was\r\n    conspicuous. The Malayan hens were a shade redder on the breast and\r\n    neck than the Indian hens. The Malayan males generally had a red\r\n    ear-lappet, instead of a white one as in India; but Mr. Blyth has\r\n    seen one Indian specimen without the white ear-lappet. The legs are\r\n    leaden blue in the Indian, whereas they show some tendency to be\r\n    yellowish in the Malayan and Javan specimens. In the former Mr.\r\n    Blyth finds the tarsus remarkably variable in length. According to\r\n    Temminck[20] the Timor specimens differ as a local race from that\r\n    of Java. These several wild varieties have not as yet been ranked\r\n    as distinct species; if they should, as is not unlikely, be\r\n    hereafter thus ranked, the circumstance would be quite immaterial\r\n    as far as the parentage and differences of our domestic breeds are\r\n    concerned. The wild _G. bankiva_ agrees most closely with the\r\n    black-breasted red Game-breed, in colouring and in all other\r\n    respects, except in being smaller, and in the tail being carried\r\n    more horizontally. But the manner in which the tail is carried is\r\n    highly variable in many of our breeds, for, as Mr. Brent informs\r\n    me, the tail slopes much in the Malays, is erect in the Games and\r\n    some other breeds, and is more than erect in Dorkings, Bantams,\r\n    etc. There is one other difference namely, that in _G. bankiva,_\r\n    according to Mr. Blyth, the neck-hackles when first moulted are\r\n    replaced during two or three months not by other hackles, as with\r\n    our domestic poultry, but by short blackish feathers.[21] Mr.\r\n    Brent, however, has remarked that these black feathers remain in\r\n    the wild bird after the development of the lower hackles, and\r\n    appear in the domestic bird at the same time with them: so that the\r\n    only difference is that the lower hackles are replaced more slowly\r\n    in the wild than in the tame bird; but as confinement is known\r\n    sometimes to affect the masculine plumage, this slight difference\r\n    cannot be considered of any importance. It is a significant fact\r\n    that the voice of both the male and female _G. bankiva_ closely\r\n    resembles, as Mr. Blyth and others have noted, the voice of both\r\n    sexes of the common domestic fowl; but the last note of the crow of\r\n    the wild bird is rather less prolonged. Captain Hutton, well known\r\n    for his researches into the natural history of India, informs me\r\n    that he has seen several crossed fowls from the wild species and\r\n    the Chinese bantam; these crossed fowls _bred freely_ with bantams,\r\n    but unfortunately were not crossed _inter se._ Captain Hutton\r\n    reared chickens from the eggs of the _Gallus bankiva_; and these,\r\n    though at first very wild, afterwards became so tame that they\r\n    would crowd round his feet. He did not succeed in rearing them to\r\n    maturity; but as he remarks, “no wild gallinaceous bird thrives\r\n    well at first on hard grain.” Mr. Blyth also found much difficulty\r\n    in keeping _G. bankiva_ in confinement. In the Philippine Islands,\r\n    however, the natives must succeed better, as they keep wild cocks\r\n    to fight with their domestic game-birds.[22] Sir Walter Elliot\r\n    informs me that the hen of a native domestic breed of Pegu is\r\n    undistinguishable from the hen of the wild _G. bankiva_; and the\r\n    natives constantly catch wild cocks by taking tame cocks to fight\r\n    with them in the woods.[23] Mr. Crawfurd remarks that from\r\n    etymology it might be argued that the fowl was first domesticated\r\n    by the Malays and Javanese.[24] It is also a curious fact, of which\r\n    I have been assured by Mr. Blyth, that wild specimens of the _\r\n    Gallus bankiva,_ brought from the countries east of the Bay of\r\n    Bengal, are far more easily tamed than those of India; nor is this\r\n    an unparalleled fact, for, as Humboldt long ago remarked, the same\r\n    species sometimes evinces a more tameable disposition in one\r\n    country than in another. If we suppose that the _G. bankiva_ was\r\n    first tamed in Malaya and afterwards imported into India, we can\r\n    understand an observation made to me by Mr. Blyth, that the\r\n    domestic fowls of India do not resemble the wild _G. bankiva_ of\r\n    India more closely than do those of Europe.\r\n\r\n    From the extremely close resemblance in colour, general structure,\r\n    and especially in voice, between _Gallus bankiva_ and the Game\r\n    fowl; from their fertility, as far as this has been ascertained,\r\n    when crossed; from the possibility of the wild species being tamed,\r\n    and from its varying in the wild state, we may confidently look at\r\n    it as the parent of the most typical of all the domestic breeds,\r\n    namely, the Game fowl. It is a significant fact, that almost all\r\n    the naturalists in India, namely Sir W. Elliot, Mr. S. N. Ward, Mr.\r\n    Layard, Mr. J. C. Jerdon, and Mr. Blyth,[25] who are familiar with\r\n    G. bankiva, believe that it is the parent of most or all our\r\n    domestic breeds. But even if it be admitted that G. bankiva is the\r\n    parent of the Game breed, yet it may be urged that other wild\r\n    species have been the parents of the other domestic breeds; and\r\n    that these species still exist, though unknown, in some country, or\r\n    have become extinct. The extinction, however, of several species of\r\n    fowls, is an improbable hypothesis, seeing that the four known\r\n    species have not become extinct in the most ancient and thickly\r\n    peopled regions of the East. There is, in fact, not one other kind\r\n    of domesticated bird, of which the wild parent-form is unknown,\r\n    that is become extinct. For the discovery of new, or the\r\n    rediscovery of old species of Gallus, we must not look, as fanciers\r\n    often look, to the whole world. The larger gallinaceous birds, as\r\n    Mr. Blyth has remarked,[26] generally have a restricted range: we\r\n    see this well illustrated in India, where the genus Gallus inhabits\r\n    the base of the Himalaya, and is succeeded higher up by\r\n    Gallophasis, and still higher up by Phasianus. Australia, with its\r\n    islands, is out of the question as the home for unknown species of\r\n    the genus. It is, also, as improbable that Gallus should inhabit\r\n    South America[27] as that a humming-bird should be found in the Old\r\n    World. From the character of the other gallinaceous birds of\r\n    Africa, it is not probable that Gallus is an African genus. We need\r\n    not look to the western parts of Asia, for Messrs. Blyth and\r\n    Crawfurd, who have attended to this subject, doubt whether Gallus\r\n    ever existed in a wild state even as far west as Persia. Although\r\n    the earliest Greek writers speak of the fowl as a Persian bird,\r\n    this probably merely indicates its line of importation. For the\r\n    discovery of unknown species we must look to India, to the\r\n    Indo-Chinese countries, and to the northern parts of the Malay\r\n    Archipelago. The southern portion of China is the most likely\r\n    country; but as Mr. Blyth informs me, skins have been exported from\r\n    China during a long period, and living birds are largely kept there\r\n    in aviaries, so that any native species of Gallus would probably\r\n    have become known. Mr. Birch, of the British Museum, has translated\r\n    for me passages from a Chinese Encyclopædia published in 1609, but\r\n    compiled from more ancient documents, in which it is said that\r\n    fowls are creatures of the West, and were introduced into the East\r\n    (_i.e._ China) in a dynasty 1400 B.C. Whatever may be thought of so\r\n    ancient a date, we see that the Indo-Chinese and Indian regions\r\n    were formerly considered by the Chinese as the source of the\r\n    domestic fowl. From these several considerations we must look to\r\n    the present metropolis of the genus, namely, to the south-eastern\r\n    parts of Asia, for the discovery of species which were formerly\r\n    domesticated, but are now unknown in the wild state; and the most\r\n    experienced ornithologists do not consider it probable that such\r\n    species will be discovered.\r\n\r\n In considering whether the domestic breeds are descended from one\r\n species, namely, _G. bankiva,_ or from several, we must not quite\r\n overlook, though we must not exaggerate, the importance of the test of\r\n fertility. Most of our domestic breeds have been so often crossed, and\r\n their mongrels so largely kept, that it is almost certain, if any\r\n degree of infertility had existed between them, it would have been\r\n detected. On the other hand, the four known species of Gallus when\r\n crossed with each other, or when crossed, with the exception of _G.\r\n bankiva,_ with the domestic fowl, produce infertile hybrids.\r\n\r\n Finally, we have not such good evidence with fowls as with pigeons, of\r\n all the breeds having descended from a single primitive stock. In both\r\n cases the argument of fertility must go for something; in both we have\r\n the improbability of man having succeeded in ancient times in\r\n thoroughly domesticating several supposed species,—most of these\r\n supposed species being extremely abnormal as compared with their\r\n natural allies,—all being now either unknown or extinct, though the\r\n parent-form of no other domesticated bird has been lost. But in\r\n searching for the supposed parent-stocks of the various breeds of the\r\n pigeon, we were enabled to confine our search to species having\r\n peculiar habits of life; whilst with fowls there is nothing in their\r\n habits in any marked manner distinct from those of other gallinaceous\r\n birds. In the case of pigeons, I have shown that purely-bred birds of\r\n every race and the crossed offspring of distinct races frequently\r\n resemble, or revert to, the wild rock-pigeon in general colour and in\r\n each characteristic mark. With fowls we have facts of a similar\r\n nature, but less strongly pronounced, which we will now discuss.\r\n\r\n_Reversion and Analogous Variation._—Purely-bred Game, Malay, Cochin,\r\nDorking, Bantam, and, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, Silk fowls, may\r\nfrequently or occasionally be met with, which are almost identical in\r\nplumage with the wild _G. bankiva._ This is a fact well deserving\r\nattention, when we reflect that these breeds rank amongst the most\r\ndistinct. Fowls thus coloured are called by amateurs black-breasted\r\nreds. Hamburghs properly have a very different plumage; nevertheless,\r\nas Mr. Tegetmeier informs me, “the great difficulty in breeding cocks\r\nof the golden-spangled variety is their tendency to have black breasts\r\nand red backs. The males of white Bantams and white Cochins, as they\r\ncome to maturity, often assume a yellowish or saffron tinge; and the\r\nlonger neck hackles of black Bantam cocks,”[28] when two or three years\r\nold, not uncommonly become ruddy; these latter Bantams occasionally\r\n“even moult brassy-winged, or actually red-shouldered.” So that in\r\nthese several cases we see a plain tendency to reversion to the hues of\r\n_G. bankiva,_ even during the lifetime of the individual bird. With\r\nSpanish, Polish, pencilled Hamburgh, silver-spangled Hamburgh fowls,\r\nand with some other less common breeds, I have never heard of a\r\nblack-breasted red bird having appeared.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience with pigeons, I made the following crosses. I first\r\nkilled all my own poultry, no others living near my house, and then\r\nprocured, by Mr. Tegetmeier’s assistance, a first-rate black Spanish\r\ncock, and hens of the following pure breeds,—white Game, white Cochin,\r\nsilver-spangled Polish, silver-spangled Hamburgh, silver-pencilled\r\nHamburgh, and white Silk. In none of these breeds is there a trace of\r\nred, nor when kept pure have I ever heard of the appearance of a red\r\nfeather; though such an occurrence would perhaps not be very improbable\r\nwith white Games and white Cochins. Of the many chickens reared from\r\nthe above six crosses the majority were black, both in the down and in\r\nthe first plumage; some were white, and a very few were mottled black\r\nand white. In one lot of eleven mixed eggs from the white Game and\r\nwhite Cochin by the black Spanish cock, seven of the chickens were\r\nwhite, and only four black. I mention this fact to show that whiteness\r\nof plumage is strongly inherited, and that the belief in the prepotent\r\npower in the male to transmit his colour is not always correct. The\r\nchickens were hatched in the spring, and in the latter part of August\r\nseveral of the young cocks began to exhibit a change, which with some\r\nof them increased during the following years. Thus a young male bird\r\nfrom the silver-spangled Polish hen was in its first plumage\r\ncoal-black, and combined in its comb, crest, wattle, and beard, the\r\ncharacters of both parents; but when two years old the secondary\r\nwing-feathers became largely and symmetrically marked with white, and,\r\nwherever in _G. bankiva_ the hackles are red, they were in this bird\r\ngreenish-black along the shaft, narrowly bordered with brownish-black,\r\nand this again broadly bordered with very pale yellowish-brown; so that\r\nin general appearance the plumage had become pale-coloured instead of\r\nblack. In this case, with advancing age there was a great change, but\r\nno reversion to the red colour of _G. bankiva._\r\n\r\nA cock with a regular rose comb derived either from the spangled or\r\npencilled silver Hamburgh was likewise at first quite black; but in\r\nless than a year the neck-hackles, as in the last case, became whitish,\r\nwhilst those on the loins assumed a decided reddish-yellow tint; and\r\nhere we see the first symptom of reversion; this likewise occurred with\r\nsome other young cocks, which need not here be described. It has also\r\nbeen recorded[29] by a breeder, that he crossed two silver-pencilled\r\nHamburgh hens with a Spanish cock, and reared a number of chickens, all\r\nof which were black, the cocks having _ golden_ and the hens brownish\r\nhackles; so that in this instance likewise there was a clear tendency\r\nto reversion.\r\n\r\nTwo young cocks from my white Game hen were at first snow white; of\r\nthese, one subsequently assumed male orange-coloured hackles, chiefly\r\non the loins, and the other an abundance of fine orange-red hackles on\r\nthe neck, loins, and upper wing-coverts. Here again we have a more\r\ndecided, though partial, reversion to the colours of _G. bankiva._ This\r\nsecond cock was in fact coloured like an inferior “pile Came cock;”—now\r\nthis sub-breed can be produced, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, by\r\ncrossing a black-breasted red Game cock with a white Game hen, and the\r\n“pile” sub-breed thus produced can afterwards be truly propagated. So\r\nthat we have the curious fact of the glossy-black Spanish cock and the\r\nblack-breasted red Game cock when crossed with white Game hens\r\nproducing offspring of nearly the same colours.\r\n\r\nI reared several birds from the white Silk hen by the Spanish cock: all\r\nwere coal-black, and all plainly showed their parentage in having\r\nblackish combs and bones; none inherited the so-called silky feathers,\r\nand the non-inheritance of this character has been observed by others.\r\nThe hens never varied in their plumage. As the young cocks grew old,\r\none of them assumed yellowish-white hackles, and thus resembled in a\r\nconsiderable degree the cross from the Hamburgh hen; the other became a\r\ngorgeous bird, so much so that an acquaintance had it preserved and\r\nstuffed simply from its beauty. When stalking about it closely\r\nresembled the wild _Gallus bankiva,_ but with the red feathers rather\r\ndarker. On close comparison one considerable difference presented\r\nitself, namely, that the primary and secondary wing-feathers were edged\r\nwith greenish-black, instead of being edged, as in _G. bankiva,_ with\r\nfulvous and red tints. The space, also, across the back, which bears\r\ndark-green feathers, was broader, and the comb was blackish. In all\r\nother respects, even in trifling details of plumage, there was the\r\nclosest accordance. Altogether it was a marvellous sight to compare\r\nthis bird first with _G. bankiva,_ and then with its father, the glossy\r\ngreen-black Spanish cock, and with its diminutive mother, the white\r\nSilk hen. This case of reversion is the more extraordinary as the\r\nSpanish breed has long been known to breed true, and no instance is on\r\nrecord of its throwing a single red feather. The Silk hen likewise\r\nbreeds true, and is believed to be ancient, for Aldrovandi, before\r\n1600, alludes probably to this breed, and described it as covered with\r\nwool. It is so peculiar in many characters that some writers have\r\nconsidered it as specifically distinct; yet, as we now see, when\r\ncrossed with the Spanish fowl, it yields offspring closely resembling\r\nthe wild _G. bankiva._\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier has been so kind as to repeat, at my request, the cross\r\nbetween a Spanish cock and Silk hen, and he obtained similar results;\r\nfor he thus raised, besides a black hen, seven cocks, all of which were\r\ndark-bodied with more or less orange-red hackles. In the ensuing year\r\nhe paired the black hen with one of her brothers, and raised three\r\nyoung cocks, all coloured like their father, and a black hen mottled\r\nwith white.\r\n\r\nThe hens from the six above-described crosses showed hardly any\r\ntendency to revert to the mottled-brown plumage of the female _G.\r\nbankiva_: one hen, however, from the white Cochin, which was at first\r\ncoal-black, became slightly brown or sooty. Several hens, which were\r\nfor a long time snow-white, acquired as they grew old a few black\r\nfeathers. A hen from the white Game, which was for a long time entirely\r\nblack glossed with green, when two years old had some of the primary\r\nwing feathers greyish-white, and a multitude of feathers over her body\r\nnarrowly and symmetrically tipped or laced with white. I had expected\r\nthat some of the chickens whilst covered with down would have assumed\r\nthe longitudinal stripes so general with gallinaceous birds; but this\r\ndid not occur in a single instance. Two or three alone were\r\nreddish-brown about their heads. I was unfortunate in losing nearly all\r\nthe white chickens from the first crosses; so that black prevailed with\r\nthe grandchildren; but they were much diversified in colour, some being\r\nsooty, others mottled, and one blackish chicken had its feathers oddly\r\ntipped and barred with brown.\r\n\r\nI will here add a few miscellaneous facts connected with reversion, and\r\nwith the law of analogous variation. This law implies, as stated in a\r\nprevious chapter, that the varieties of one species frequently mock\r\ndistinct but allied species; and this fact is explained, according to\r\nthe views which I maintain, on the principle of allied species having\r\ndescended from one primitive form. The white Silk fowl with black skin\r\nand bones degenerates, as has been observed by Mr. Hewitt and Mr. R.\r\nOrton, in our climate; that is, it reverts to the ordinary colour of\r\nthe common fowl in its skin and bones, due care having been taken to\r\nprevent any cross. In Germany[30] a distinct breed with black bones,\r\nand with black, not silky plumage, has likewise been observed to\r\ndegenerate.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier informs me that, when distinct breeds are crossed, fowls\r\nare frequently produced with their feathers marked or pencilled by\r\nnarrow transverse lines of a darker colour. This may be in part\r\nexplained by direct reversion to the parent-form, the Bankiva hen; for\r\nthis bird has all its upper plumage finely mottled with dark and rufous\r\nbrown, with the mottling partially and obscurely arranged in transverse\r\nlines. But the tendency to pencilling is probably much strengthened by\r\nthe law of analogous variation, for the hens of some other species of\r\nGallus are more plainly pencilled, and the hens of many gallinaceous\r\nbirds belonging to other genera, as the partridge, have pencilled\r\nfeathers. Mr. Tegetmeier has also remarked to me that, although with\r\ndomestic pigeons we have so great a diversity of colouring, we never\r\nsee either pencilled or spangled feathers; and this fact is\r\nintelligible on the law of analogous variation, as neither the wild\r\nrock pigeon nor any closely allied species has such feathers. The\r\nfrequent appearance of pencilling in crossed birds probably accounts\r\nfor the existence of “cuckoo” sub-breeds in the Game, Polish, Dorking,\r\nCochin, Andalusian, and Bantam breeds. The plumage of these birds is\r\nslaty-blue or grey, with each feather transversely barred with darker\r\nlines, so as to resemble in some degree the plumage of the cuckoo. It\r\nis a singular fact, considering that the male of no species of Gallus\r\nis in the least barred, that the cuckoo-like plumage has often been\r\ntransferred to the male, more especially in the cuckoo Dorking; and the\r\nfact is all the more singular, as in gold- and silver-pencilled\r\nHamburghs, in which pencilling is characteristic of the breed, the male\r\nis hardly at all pencilled, this kind of plumage being confined to the\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nAnother case of analogous variation is the occurrence of spangled\r\nsub-breeds of Hamburgh, Polish, Malay, and Bantam fowls. Spangled\r\nfeathers have a dark mark, properly crescent-shaped, on their tips;\r\nwhilst pencilled feathers have several transverse bars. The spangling\r\ncannot be due to reversion to _G. bankiva_; nor does it often follow,\r\nas I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, from crossing distinct breeds; but it is\r\na case of analogous variation, for many gallinaceous birds have\r\nspangled feathers,—for instance, the common pheasant. Hence spangled\r\nbreeds are often called “pheasant”-fowls. Another case of analogous\r\nvariation in several domestic breeds is inexplicable; it is, that the\r\nchickens, whilst covered with down, of the black Spanish, black Game,\r\nblack Polish, and black Bantam, all have white throats and breasts, and\r\noften have some white on their wings.[31] The editor of the ‘Poultry\r\nChronicle’[32] remarks that all the breeds which properly have red\r\near-lappets occasionally produce birds with white ear-Tappets. This\r\nremark more especially applies to the Game breed, which of all comes\r\nnearest to the _G. bankiva_; and we have seen that with this species\r\nliving in a state of nature, the ear-lappets vary in colour, being red\r\nin the Malayan countries, and generally, but not invariably, white in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this part of my subject, I may repeat that there exists\r\none widely-ranging, varying, and common species of Gallus, namely, _G.\r\nbankiva,_ which can be tamed, produces fertile offspring when crossed\r\nwith common fowls, and closely resembles in its whole structure,\r\nplumage, and voice the Game breed; hence it may be safely ranked as the\r\nparent of this, the most typical domesticated breed. We have seen that\r\nthere is much difficulty in believing that other, now unknown, species\r\nhave been the parents of the other domestic breeds. We know that all\r\nthe breeds are most closely allied, as shown by their similarity in\r\nmost points of structure and in habits, and by the analogous manner in\r\nwhich they vary. We have also seen that several of the most distinct\r\nbreeds occasionally or habitually closely resemble in plumage _G.\r\nbankiva,_ and that the crossed offspring of other breeds, which are not\r\nthus coloured, show a stronger or weaker tendency to revert to this\r\nsame plumage. Some of the breeds, which appear the most distinct and\r\nthe least likely to have proceeded from _G. bankiva,_ such as Polish\r\nfowls, with their protuberant and little ossified skulls, and Cochins,\r\nwith their imperfect tail and small wings, bear in these characters the\r\nplain marks of their artificial origin. We know well that of late years\r\nmethodical selection has greatly improved and fixed many characters;\r\nand we have every reason to believe that unconscious selection, carried\r\non for many generations, will have steadily augmented each new\r\npeculiarity, and thus have given rise to new breeds. As soon as two or\r\nthree breeds were once formed, crossing would come into play in\r\nchanging their character and in increasing their number. Brahma\r\nPootras, according to an account lately published in America, offer a\r\ngood instance of a breed, lately formed by a cross, which can be truly\r\npropagated. The well-known Sebright Bantams offer another and similar\r\ninstance. Hence it may be concluded that not only the Game-breed but\r\nthat all our breeds are probably the descendants of the Malayan or\r\nIndian variety of _G. bankiva._ If so, this species has varied greatly\r\nsince it was first domesticated; but there has been ample time, as we\r\nshall now show.\r\n\r\n_History of the Fowl._—Rütimeyer found no remains of the fowl in the\r\nancient Swiss lake-dwellings; but, according to Jeitteles,[33] such\r\nhave certainly since been found associated with extinct animals and\r\nprehistoric remains. It is, therefore a strange fact that the fowl is\r\nnot mentioned in the Old Testament, nor figured on the ancient Egyptian\r\nmonuments. It is not referred to by Homer or Hesiod (about 900 B.C.);\r\nbut is mentioned by Theognis and Aristophanes between 400 and 500 B.C.\r\nIt is figured on some of the Babylonian cylinders, between the sixth\r\nand seventh centuries B.C., of which Mr. Layard sent me an impression;\r\nand on the Harpy Tomb in Lycia, about 600 B.C.: so that the fowl\r\napparently reached Europe in a domesticated condition somewhere about\r\nthe sixth century B.C. It had travelled still farther westward by the\r\ntime of the Christian era, for it was found in Britain by Julius Cæsar.\r\nIn India it must have been domesticated when the Institutes of Manu\r\nwere written, that is, according to Sir W. Jones, 1200 B.C., but,\r\naccording to the later authority of Mr. H. Wilson, only 800 B.C., for\r\nthe domestic fowl is forbidden, whilst the wild is permitted to be\r\neaten. If, as before remarked, we may trust the old Chinese\r\nEncyclopædia, the fowl must have been domesticated several centuries\r\nearlier, as it is said to have been introduced from the West into China\r\n1400 B.C.\r\n\r\nSufficient materials do not exist for tracing the history of the\r\nseparate breeds. About the commencement of the Christian era, Columella\r\nmentions a five-toed fighting breed, and some provincial breeds; but we\r\nknow nothing about them. He also alludes to dwarf fowls; but these\r\ncannot have been the same with our Bantams, which, as Mr. Crawfurd has\r\nshown, were imported from Japan into Bantam in Java. A dwarf fowl,\r\nprobably the true Bantam, is referred to in an old Japanese\r\nEncyclopædia, as I am informed by Mr. Birch. In the Chinese\r\nEncyclopædia published in 1596, but compiled from various sources, some\r\nof high antiquity, seven breeds are mentioned, including what we should\r\nnow call Jumpers or Creepers, and likewise fowls with black feathers,\r\nbones, and flesh. In 1600 Aldrovandi describes seven or eight breeds of\r\nfowls, and this is the most ancient record from which the age of our\r\nEuropean breeds can be inferred. The _Gallus turcicus_ certainly seems\r\nto be a pencilled Hamburgh; but Mr. Brent, a most capable judge, thinks\r\nthat Aldrovandi “evidently figured what he happened to see, and not the\r\nbest of the breed.” Mr. Brent, indeed, considers all Aldrovandi’s fowls\r\nas of impure breed; but it is a far more probable view that all our\r\nbreeds have been much improved and modified since his time; for, as he\r\nwent to the expense of so many figures, he probably would have secured\r\ncharacteristic specimens. The Silk fowl, however, probably then existed\r\nin its present state, as did almost certainly the fowl with frizzled or\r\nreversed feathers. Mr. Dixon[34] considers Aldrovandi’s Paduan fowl as\r\n“a variety of the Polish,” whereas Mr. Brent believes it to have been\r\nmore nearly allied to the Malay. The anatomical peculiarities of the\r\nskull of the Polish breed were noticed by P. Borelli in 1656. I may add\r\nthat in 1737 one Polish sub-breed, viz., the Golden-spangled, was\r\nknown; but judging from Albin’s description, the comb was then larger,\r\nthe crest of feathers much smaller, the breast more coarsely spotted,\r\nand the stomach and thighs much blacker: a Golden-spangled Polish fowl\r\nin this condition would now be of no value.\r\n\r\n_Differences in External and Internal Structure between the Breeds:\r\nIndividual Variability._—Fowls have been exposed to diversified\r\nconditions of life, and as we have just seen there has been ample time\r\nfor much variability and for the slow action of unconscious selection.\r\nAs there are good grounds for believing that all the breeds are\r\ndescended from Gallus bankiva, it will be worth while to describe in\r\nsome detail the chief points of difference. Beginning with the eggs and\r\nchickens, I will pass on to their secondary sexual characters, and then\r\nto their differences in external structure and in the skeleton. I enter\r\non the following details chiefly to show how variable almost every\r\ncharacter has become under domestication.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._—Mr. Dixon remarks[35] that “to every hen belongs an individual\r\npeculiarity in the form, colour, and size of her egg, which never\r\nchanges during her life-time, so long as she remains in health, and\r\nwhich is as well known to those who are in the habit of taking her\r\nproduce, as the hand-writing of their nearest acquaintance.” I believe\r\nthat this is generally true, and that, if no great number of hens be\r\nkept, the eggs of each can almost always be recognised. The eggs of\r\ndifferently sized breeds naturally differ much in size; but apparently,\r\nnot always in strict relation to the size of the hen: thus the Malay is\r\na larger bird than the Spanish, but  she produces not such large eggs;\r\nwhite Bantams are said to lay smaller eggs than other Bantams;[36]\r\nwhite Cochins, on the other hand, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier,\r\ncertainly lay larger eggs than buff Cochins. The eggs, however, of the\r\ndifferent breeds vary considerably in character; for instance, Mr.\r\nBallance states[37] that his Malay “pullets of last year laid eggs\r\nequal in size to those of any duck, and other Malay hens, two or three\r\nyears old, laid eggs very little larger than a good sized Bantam’s egg.\r\nSome were as white as a Spanish hen’s egg, and others varied from a\r\nlight cream-colour to a deep rich buff, or even to a brown.” The shape\r\nalso varies, the two ends being much more equally rounded in Cochins\r\nthan in Games or Polish. Spanish fowls lay smoother eggs than Cochins,\r\nof which the eggs are generally granulated. The shell in this latter\r\nbreed, and more especially in Malays is apt to be thicker than in Games\r\nor Spanish; but the Minorcas, a sub-breed of Spanish, are said to lay\r\nharder eggs than true Spanish.[38] The colour differs considerably,—the\r\nCochins laying buff-coloured eggs; the Malays a paler variable buff;\r\nand Games a still paler buff. It would appear that darker-coloured eggs\r\ncharacterise the breeds which have lately come from the East, or are\r\nstill closely allied to those now living there. The colour of the yolk,\r\naccording to Ferguson, as well as of the shell, differs slightly in the\r\nsub-breeds of the Game. I am also informed by Mr. Brent that dark\r\npartridge-coloured Cochin hens lay darker coloured eggs than the other\r\nCochin sub-breeds. The flavour and richness of the egg certainly differ\r\nin different breeds. The productiveness of the several breeds is very\r\ndifferent. Spanish, Polish, and Hamburgh hens have lost the incubating\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\n_Chickens._—As the young of almost all gallinaceous birds, even of the\r\nblack curassow and black grouse, whilst covered with down, are\r\nlongitudinally striped on the back,—of which character, when adult,\r\nneither sex retains a trace,—it might have been expected that the\r\nchickens of all our domestic fowls would have been similarly\r\nstriped.[39] This could, however, hardly have been expected, when the\r\nadult plumage in both sexes has undergone so great a change as to be\r\nwholly white or black. In white fowls of various breeds the chickens\r\nare uniformly yellowish white, passing in the black-boned Silk fowl\r\ninto bright canary-yellow. This is also generally the case with the\r\nchickens of white Cochins, but I hear from Mr. Zurhost that they are\r\nsometimes of a buff or oak colour, and that all those of this latter\r\ncolour, which were watched, turned out males. The chickens of buff\r\nCochins are of a golden-yellow, easily distinguishable from the paler\r\ntint of the white Cochins, and are often longitudinally streaked with\r\ndark shades: the chickens of silver-cinnamon Cochins are almost always\r\nof a buff colour. The chickens of the white Game and white Dorking\r\nbreeds, when held in particular lights, sometimes exhibit (on the\r\nauthority of Mr. Brent) faint traces of longitudinal stripes. Fowls\r\nwhich are entirely black, namely, Spanish, black Game, black Polish,\r\nand black Bantams, display a new character, for their chickens have\r\ntheir breasts and throats more or less white, with sometimes a little\r\nwhite elsewhere. Spanish chickens also, occasionally (Brent), have,\r\nwhere the down was white, their first true feathers tipped for a time\r\nwith white. The primordially striped character is retained by the\r\nchickens of most of the Game sub-breeds (Brent, Dixon); by Dorkings; by\r\nthe partridge and grouse-coloured sub-breeds of Cochins (Brent), but\r\nnot, as we have seen, by the sub-breeds; by the pheasant-Malay (Dixon),\r\nbut apparently not (at which I am much surprised) by other Malays. The\r\nfollowing breeds and sub-breeds are barely, or not at all,\r\nlongitudinally striped: viz., gold and silver pencilled Hamburghs,\r\nwhich can hardly be distinguished from each other (Brent) in the down,\r\nboth having a few dark spots on the head and rump, with occasionally a\r\nlongitudinal stripe (Dixon) on the back of the neck. I have seen only\r\none chicken of the silver-spangled Hamburgh, and this was obscurely\r\nstriped along the back. Gold-spangled Polish chickens (Tegetmeier) are\r\nof a warm russet brown; and silver-spangled Polish chickens are grey,\r\nsometimes (Dixon) with dashes of ochre on the head, wings, and breast.\r\nCuckoo and blue-dun fowls (Dixon) are grey in the down. The chickens of\r\nSebright Bantams (Dixon) are uniformly dark brown, whilst those of the\r\nbrown-breasted red Game Bantam are black, with some white on the throat\r\nand breast. From these facts we see that young chickens of the\r\ndifferent breeds, and even of the same main breed, differ much in their\r\ndowny plumage; and, although longitudinal stripes characterise the\r\nyoung of all wild gallinaceous birds, they disappear in several\r\ndomestic breeds. Perhaps it may be accepted as a general rule that the\r\nmore the adult plumage differs from that of the adult _G. bankiva,_ the\r\nmore completely the chickens have lost their stripes.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the period of life at which the characters proper to\r\neach breed first appear, it is obvious that such structures as\r\nadditional toes must be formed long before birth. In Polish fowls, the\r\nextraordinary protuberance of the anterior part of the skull is well\r\ndeveloped before the chickens come out of the egg;[40] but the crest,\r\nwhich is supported on the protuberance, is at first feebly developed,\r\nnor does it attain its full size until the second year. The Spanish\r\ncock is pre-eminent for his magnificent comb, and this is developed at\r\nan unusually early age; so that the young males can be distinguished\r\nfrom the females when only a few weeks old, and therefore earlier than\r\nin other breeds; they likewise crow very early, namely, when about six\r\nweeks old. In the Dutch sub-breed of the Spanish fowl the white\r\near-lappets are developed earlier than in the common Spanish breed.[41]\r\nCochins are characterised by a small tail, and in the young cocks the\r\ntail is developed at an unusually late period.[42] Game fowls are\r\nnotorious for their pugnacity; and the young cocks crow, clap their\r\nlittle wings, and fight obstinately with each other, even whilst under\r\ntheir mother’s care.[43] “I have often had,” says one author,[44]\r\n“whole broods, scarcely feathered, stone-blind from fighting; the rival\r\ncouples moping in corners, and renewing their battles on obtaining the\r\nfirst ray of light.” The weapons and pugnacity of all male gallinaceous\r\nbirds evidently serve the purpose of gaining possession of the females;\r\nso that the tendency in our Game chickens to fight at an extremely\r\nearly age is not only useless, but injurious, as they suffer much from\r\ntheir wounds. The training for battle during an early age may be\r\nnatural to the wild Gallus bankiva; but as man during many generations\r\nhas gone on selecting the most obstinately pugnacious cocks, it is more\r\nprobable that their pugnacity has been unnaturally increased, and\r\nunnaturally transferred to the young male chickens. In the same manner,\r\nit is probable that the extraordinary development of the comb in the\r\nSpanish cock has been unintentionally transferred to the young cocks;\r\nfor fanciers would not care whether their young birds had large combs,\r\nbut would select for breeding the adults which had the finest combs,\r\nwhether or not developed at an early period. The last point which need\r\nhere be noticed is that, though the chickens of Spanish and Malay fowls\r\nare well covered with down, the true feathers are acquired at an\r\nunusually late age; so that for a time the young birds are partially\r\nnaked, and are liable to suffer from cold.\r\n\r\n_Secondary Sexual Characters._—The two sexes in the parent-form, the\r\n_Gallus bankiva,_ differ much in colour. In our domestic breeds the\r\ndifference is never greater, but is often less, and varies much in\r\ndegree even in the sub-breeds of the same main breed. Thus in certain\r\nGame fowls the difference is as great as in the parent-form, whilst in\r\nthe black and white sub-breeds there is no difference in plumage. Mr.\r\nBrent informs me that he has seen two strains of black-breasted red\r\nGames, of which the cocks could not be distinguished, whilst the hens\r\nin one were partridge-brown and in the other fawn-brown. A similar case\r\nhas been observed in the strains of the brown-breasted red Game. The\r\nhen of the “duck-winged Game” is “extremely beautiful,” and differs\r\nmuch from the hens of all the other Game sub-breeds; but generally, as\r\nwith the blue and grey Game and with some sub-varieties of the\r\npile-game, a moderately close relation may be observed between the\r\nmales and females in the variation of their plumage.[45] A similar\r\nrelation is also evident when we compare the several varieties of\r\nCochins. In the two sexes of gold and silver-spangled and of buff\r\nPolish fowls, there is much general similarity in the colouring and\r\nmarks of the whole plumage, excepting of course in the hackles, crest,\r\nand beard. In spangled Hamburghs, there is likewise a considerable\r\ndegree of similarity between the two sexes. In pencilled Hamburghs, on\r\nthe other hand, there is much dissimilarity; the pencilling which is\r\ncharacteristic of the hens being almost absent in the males of both the\r\ngolden and silver varieties. But, as we have already seen, it cannot be\r\ngiven as a general rule that male fowls never have pencilled feathers,\r\nfor Cuckoo Dorkings are “remarkable from having nearly similar markings\r\nin both sexes.”\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that the males in certain sub-breeds have lost\r\nsome of their secondary masculine characters, and from their close\r\nresemblance in plumage to the females, are often called hennies. There\r\nis much diversity of opinion whether these males are in any degree\r\nsterile; that they sometimes are partially sterile seems clear,[46] but\r\nthis may have been caused by too close interbreeding. That they are not\r\nquite sterile, and that the whole case is widely different from that of\r\nold females assuming masculine characters, is evident from several of\r\nthese hen-like sub-breeds having been long propagated. The males and\r\nfemales of gold and silver-laced Sebright Bantams can be barely\r\ndistinguished from each other, except by their combs, wattles, and\r\nspurs, for they are coloured alike, and the males have not hackles, nor\r\nthe flowing sickle-like tail-feathers. A hen-tailed sub-breed of\r\nHamburghs was recently much esteemed. There is also a breed of\r\nGame-fowls, in which the males and females resemble each other so\r\nclosely that the cocks have often mistaken their hen-feathered\r\nopponents in the cock-pit for real hens, and by the mistake have lost\r\ntheir lives.[47] The cocks, though dressed in the feathers of the hen,\r\n“are high-spirited birds, and their courage has been often proved:” an\r\nengraving even has been published of one celebrated hen-tailed victor.\r\nMr. Tegetmeier[48] has recorded the remarkable case of a brown-breasted\r\nred Game cock which, after assuming its perfect masculine plumage,\r\nbecame hen-feathered in the autumn of the following year; but he did\r\nnot lose voice, spurs, strength, nor productiveness. This bird has now\r\nretained the same character during five seasons, and has begot both\r\nhen-feathered and male-feathered offspring. Mr. Grantley F. Berkeley\r\nrelates the still more singular case of a celebrated strain of “polecat\r\nGame fowls,” which produced in nearly every brood a single hen-cock.\r\n“The great peculiarity in one of these birds was that he, as the\r\nseasons succeeded each other, was not always a hen-cock, and not always\r\nof the colour called the polecat, which is black. From the polecat and\r\nhen-cock feather in one season he moulted to a full male-plumaged\r\nblack-breasted red, and in the following year he returned to the former\r\nfeather.”[49]\r\n\r\nI have remarked in my ‘Origin of Species’ that secondary sexual\r\ncharacters are apt to differ much in the species of the same genus, and\r\nto be unusually variable in the individuals of the same species. So it\r\nis with the breeds of the fowl, as we have already seen, as far as the\r\ncolour of plumage is concerned, and so it is with the other secondary\r\nsexual characters. Firstly, the comb differs much in the various\r\nbreeds,[50] and its form is eminently characteristic of each kind, with\r\nthe exception of the Dorkings, in which the form has not been as yet\r\ndetermined on by fanciers, and fixed by selection. A single,\r\ndeeply-serrated comb is the typical and most common form. It differs\r\nmuch in size, being immensely developed in Spanish fowls; and in a\r\nlocal breed called Red-caps, it is sometimes “upwards of three inches\r\nin breadth at the front, and more than four inches in length, measured\r\nto the end of the peak behind.”[51] In some breeds the comb is double,\r\nand when the two ends are cemented together it forms a “cup-comb;” in\r\nthe “rose-comb” it is depressed, covered with small projections, and\r\nproduced backwards; in the horned and creve-coeur fowl it is produced\r\ninto two horns; it is triple in the pea-combed Brahmas, short and\r\ntruncated in the Malays, and absent in the Guelderlands. In the\r\ntasselled Game a few long feathers rise from the back of the comb: in\r\nmany breeds a crest of feathers replaces the comb. The crest, when\r\nlittle developed, arises from a fleshy mass, but, when much developed,\r\nfrom a hemispherical protuberance of the skull. In the best Polish\r\nfowls it is so largely developed, that I have seen birds which could\r\nhardly pick up their food; and a German writer asserts[52] that they\r\nare in consequence liable to be struck by hawks. Monstrous structures\r\nof this kind would thus be suppressed in a state of nature. The\r\nwattles, also, vary much in size, being small in Malays and some other\r\nbreeds; in certain Polish sub-breeds they are replaced by a great tuft\r\nof feathers called a beard.\r\n\r\nThe hackles do not differ much in the various breeds, but are short and\r\nstiff in Malays, and absent in Hennies. As in some orders male birds\r\ndisplay extraordinarily-shaped feathers, such as naked shafts with\r\ndiscs at the end, etc., the following case may be worth giving. In the\r\nwild _Gallus bankiva_ and in our domestic fowls, the barbs which arise\r\nfrom each side of the extremities of the hackles are naked or not\r\nclothed with barbules, so that they resemble bristles; but Mr. Brent\r\nsent me some scapular hackles from a young Birchen Duckwing Game cock,\r\nin which the naked barbs became densely re-clothed with barbules\r\ntowards their tips; so that these tips, which were dark coloured with a\r\nmetallic lustre, were separated from the lower parts by a\r\nsymmetrically-shaped transparent zone formed of the naked portions of\r\nthe barbs. Hence the coloured tips appeared like little separate\r\nmetallic discs.\r\n\r\nThe sickle-feathers in the tail, of which there are three pair, and\r\nwhich are eminently characteristic of the male sex, differ much in the\r\nvarious breeds. They are scimitar-shaped in some Hamburghs, instead of\r\nbeing long and flowing as in the typical breeds. They are extremely\r\nshort in Cochins, and are not at all developed in Hennies. They are\r\ncarried, together with the whole tail, erect in Dorkings and Gaines;\r\nbut droop much in Malays and in some Cochins. Sultans are characterised\r\nby an additional number of lateral sickle-feathers. The spurs vary\r\nmuch, being placed higher or lower on the shank; being extremely long\r\nand sharp in Games, and blunt and short in Cochins. These latter birds\r\nseem aware that their spurs are not efficient weapons; for though they\r\noccasionally use them, they more frequently fight, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Tegetmeier, by seizing and shaking each other with their beaks. In\r\nsome Indian Game cocks, received by Mr. Brent from Germany, there are,\r\nas he informs me, three, four, or even five spurs on each leg. Some\r\nDorkings also have two spurs on each leg;[53] and in birds of this\r\nbreed the spur is often placed almost on the outside of the leg. Double\r\nspurs are mentioned in an ancient Chinese Encyclopædia. Their\r\noccurrence may be considered as a case of analogous variation, for some\r\nwild gallinaceous birds, for instance, the Polyplectron, have double\r\nspurs.\r\n\r\nJudging from the differences which generally distinguish the sexes in\r\nthe Gallinaceæ, certain characters in our domestic fowls appear to have\r\nbeen transferred from the one sex to the other. In all the species\r\n(except in Turnix), when there is any conspicuous difference in plumage\r\nbetween the male and female, the male is always the most beautiful; but\r\nin golden-spangled Hamburghs the hen is equally beautiful with the\r\ncock, and incomparably more beautiful than the hen in any natural\r\nspecies of Gallus; so that here a masculine character has been\r\ntransferred to the female. On the other hand, in Cuckoo Dorkings and in\r\nother cuckoo breeds the pencilling, which in Gallus is a female\r\nattribute, has been transferred to the male: nor, on the principle of\r\nanalogous variation, is this transference surprising, as the males in\r\nmany gallinaceous genera are barred or pencilled. With most of these\r\nbirds head ornaments of all kinds are more fully developed in the male\r\nthan in the female; but in Polish fowls the crest or top-knot, which in\r\nthe male replaces the comb, is equally developed in both sexes. In the\r\nmales of certain other sub-breeds, which from the hen having a small\r\ncrest, are called lark-crested, “a single upright comb sometimes almost\r\nentirely takes the place of the crest.”[54] From this latter case, and\r\nmore especially from some facts presently to be given with respect to\r\nthe protuberance of the skull in Polish fowls, the crest in this breed\r\nmust be viewed as a feminine character which has been transferred to\r\nthe male. In the Spanish breed the male, as we know, has an immense\r\ncomb, and this has been partially transferred to the female, for her\r\ncomb is unusually large, though not upright. In Game fowls the bold and\r\nsavage disposition of the male has likewise been largely transferred to\r\nthe female;[55] and she sometimes even possesses the eminently\r\nmasculine character of spurs. Many cases are on record of fertile hens\r\nbeing furnished with spurs; and in Germany, according to Bechstein,[56]\r\nthe spurs in the Silk hen are sometimes very long. He mentions also\r\nanother breed similarly characterised, in which the hens are excellent\r\nlayers, but are apt to disturb and break their eggs owing to their\r\nspurs.\r\n\r\nMr. Layard[57] has given an account of a breed of fowls in Ceylon with\r\nblack skin, bones, and wattle, but with ordinary feathers, and which\r\ncannot “be more aptly described than by comparing them to a white fowl\r\ndrawn down a sooty chimney; it is, however,” adds Mr. Layard, “a\r\nremarkable fact that a male bird of the pure sooty variety is almost as\r\nrare as a tortoise-shell tom-cat.” Mr. Blyth found the same rule to\r\nhold good with this breed near Calcutta. The males and females, on the\r\nother hand, of the black-boned European breed, with silky feathers, do\r\nnot differ from each other; so that in the one breed, black skin and\r\nbones and the same kind of plumage are common to both sexes, whilst in\r\nthe other breed, these characters are confined to the female sex.\r\n\r\nAt the present day all the breeds of Polish fowls have the great bony\r\nprotuberance on their skulls, which includes part of the brain and\r\nsupports the crest, equally developed in both sexes. But formerly in\r\nGermany the skull of the hen alone was protuberant: Blumenbach,[58] who\r\nparticularly attended to abnormal peculiarities in domestic animals,\r\nstates, in 1805, that this was the case; and Bechstein had previously,\r\nin 1793 observed the same fact. This latter author has carefully\r\ndescribed the effects on the skull of a crest not only in the case of\r\nfowls, but of ducks, geese, and canaries. He states that with fowls,\r\nwhen the crest is not much developed, it is supported on a fatty mass;\r\nbut when much developed, it is always supported on a bony protuberance\r\nof variable size. He well describes the peculiarities of this\r\nprotuberance; he attended also to the effects of the modified shape of\r\nthe brain on the intellect of these birds, and disputes Pallas’\r\nstatement that they are stupid. He then expressly remarks that he never\r\nobserved this protuberance in male fowls. Hence there can be no doubt\r\nthat this extraordinary character in the skulls of Polish fowls was\r\nformerly in Germany confined to the female sex, but has now been\r\ntransferred to the males, and has thus become common to both sexes.\r\n\r\n     _External Differences, not connected with the Sexes, between the\r\n     Breeds and between individual Birds._\r\n\r\nThe size of the body differs greatly. Mr. Tegetmeier has known a Brahma\r\nto weigh 17 pounds; a fine Malay cock 10 pounds; whilst a first-rate\r\nSebright Bantam weighs hardly more than 1 pound. During the last 20\r\nyears the size of some of our breeds has been largely increased by\r\nmethodical selection, whilst that of other breeds has been much\r\ndiminished. We have already seen how greatly colour varies even within\r\nthe same breed; we know that the wild _G. bankiva_ varies slightly in\r\ncolour; we know that colour is variable in all our domestic animals;\r\nnevertheless some eminent fanciers have so little faith in variability,\r\nthat they have actually argued that the chief Game sub-breeds, which\r\ndiffer from each other in nothing but colour, are descended from\r\ndistinct wild species! Crossing often causes strange modification of\r\ncolour. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that when buff and white Cochins are\r\ncrossed, some of the chickens are almost invariably black. According to\r\nMr. Brent, black and white Cochins occasionally produce chickens of a\r\nslaty-blue tint; and this same tint results, as Mr. Tegetmeier tells\r\nme, from crossing white Cochins with black Spanish fowls, or white\r\nDorkings with black Minorcas.[59] A good observer[60] states that a\r\nfirst-rate silver-spangled Hamburgh hen gradually lost the most\r\ncharacteristic qualities of the breed, for the black lacing to her\r\nfeathers disappeared, and her legs changed from leaden-blue to white:\r\nbut what makes the case remarkable is, that this tendency ran in the\r\nblood for her sister changed in a similar but less strongly marked\r\nmanner; and chickens produced from this latter hen were at first almost\r\npure white, “but on moulting acquired black colours and some spangled\r\nfeathers with almost obliterated markings;” so that a new variety arose\r\nin this singular manner. The skin in the different breeds differs much\r\nin colour, being white in common kinds, yellow in Malays and Cochins,\r\nand black in Silk fowls; thus mocking, as M. Godron[61] remarks the\r\nthree principal types of skin in mankind. The same author adds that, as\r\ndifferent kinds of fowls living in distant and isolated parts of the\r\nworld have black skin and bones, this colour must have appeared at\r\nvarious times and places.\r\n\r\nThe shape and carriage of the body, and the shape of the head differ\r\nmuch. The beak varies slightly in length and curvature, but\r\nincomparably less than with pigeons. In most crested fowls the nostrils\r\noffer a remarkable peculiarity in being raised with a crescentic\r\noutline. The primary wing-feathers are short in Cochins; in a male,\r\nwhich must have been more than twice as heavy as _G. bankiva,_ these\r\nfeathers were in both birds of the same length. I have counted, with\r\nMr. Tegetmeier’s aid, the primary wing-feathers in thirteen cocks and\r\nhens of various breeds; in four of them, namely in two Hamburghs, a\r\nCochin, and Game bantam, there were 10, instead of the normal number 9;\r\nbut in counting these feathers I have followed the practice of\r\nfanciers, and have _not_ included the first minute primary feather,\r\nbarely three-quarters of an inch in length. These feathers differ\r\nconsiderably in relative length, the fourth, or the fifth, or the\r\nsixth, being the longest; with the third either equal to, or\r\nconsiderably shorter than the fifth. In wild gallinaceous species the\r\nrelative length and number of the main wing and tail-feathers are\r\nextremely constant.\r\n\r\nThe tail differs much in erectness and size, being small in Malays and\r\nvery small in Cochins. In thirteen fowls of various breeds which I have\r\nexamined, five had the normal number of 14 feathers, including in this\r\nnumber the two middle sickle-feathers; six others (viz., a Caffre cock,\r\nGold-spangled Polish cock, Cochin hen, Sultan hen, Game hen and Malay\r\nhen had 16; and two (an old Cochin cock and Malay hen) had 17 feathers.\r\nThe rumpless fowl has no tail and in one which I possessed there was no\r\noil-gland; but this bird though the os coccygis was extremely\r\nimperfect, had a vestige of a tail with two rather long feathers in the\r\nposition of the outer caudals. This bird came from a family where, as I\r\nwas told, the breed had kept true for twenty years; but rumpless fowls\r\noften produce chickens with tails.[62] An eminent physiologist[63] has\r\nrecently spoken of this breed as a distinct species; had he examined\r\nthe deformed state of the os coccyx he would never have come to this\r\nconclusion; he was probably misled by the statement, which may be found\r\nin some works, that tailless fowls are wild in Ceylon; but this\r\nstatement, as I have been assured by Mr. Layard and Dr. Kellaert who\r\nhave so closely studied the birds of Ceylon, is utterly false.\r\n\r\nThe tarsi vary considerably in length, being relatively to the femur\r\nconsiderably longer in the Spanish and Frizzled, and shorter in the\r\nSilk and Bantam breeds, than in the wild _G. bankiva_; but in the\r\nlatter, as we have seen, the tarsi vary in length. The tarsi are often\r\nfeathered. The feet in many breeds are furnished with additional toes.\r\nGolden-spangled Polish fowls are said[64] to have the skin between\r\ntheir toes much developed: Mr. Tegetmeier observed this in one bird,\r\nbut it was not so in one which I examined. Prof. Hoffmann has sent me a\r\nsketch of the feet of a fowl of the common breed at Giessen, with a web\r\nextending between the three toes, for about a third of their length. In\r\nCochins the middle toe is said[65] to be nearly double the length of\r\nthe lateral toes, and therefore much longer than in _G. bankiva_ or in\r\nother fowls; but this was not the case in two which I examined. The\r\nnail of the middle toe in this same breed is surprisingly broad and\r\nflat, but in a variable degree in two birds which I examined; of this\r\nstructure in the nail there is only a trace in _G. bankiva._\r\n\r\nThe voice differs slightly, as I am informed by Mr. Dixon, in almost\r\nevery breed. The Malays[66] have a loud, deep, somewhat prolonged crow,\r\nbut with considerable individual difference. Colonel Sykes remarks that\r\nthe domestic Kulm cock in India has not the shrill clear pipe of the\r\nEnglish bird, and “his scale of notes appears more limited.” Dr. Hooker\r\nwas struck with the “prolonged howling screech” of the cocks in\r\nSikhim.[67] The crow of the Cochin is notoriously and ludicrously\r\ndifferent from that of the common cock. The disposition of the\r\ndifferent breeds is widely different, varying from the savage and\r\ndefiant temper of the Game-cock to the extremely peaceable temper of\r\nthe Cochins. The latter, it has been asserted, “graze to a much greater\r\nextent than any other varieties.” The Spanish fowls suffer more from\r\nfrost than other breeds.\r\n\r\nBefore we pass on to the skeleton, the degree of distinctness of the\r\nseveral breeds from _G. bankiva_ ought to be noticed. Some writers\r\nspeak of the Spanish as one of the most distinct breeds, and so it is\r\nin general aspect; but its characteristic differences are not\r\nimportant. The Malay appears to me more distinct, from its tall\r\nstature, small drooping tail with more than fourteen tail-feathers, and\r\nfrom its small comb and wattles; nevertheless, one Malay sub-breed is\r\ncoloured almost exactly like _G. bankiva._ Some authors consider the\r\nPolish fowl as very distinct; but this is a semi-monstrous breed, as\r\nshown by the protuberant and irregularly perforated skull. The Cochin,\r\nfrom its deeply furrowed frontal bones, peculiarly shaped occipital\r\nforamen, short wing-feathers, short tail containing more than fourteen\r\nfeathers, broad nail to the middle toe, fluffy plumage, rough and\r\ndark-coloured eggs, and especially from its peculiar voice, is probably\r\nthe most distinct of all the breeds. If any one of our breeds has\r\ndescended from some unknown species, distinct from _G. bankiva,_ it is\r\nprobably the Cochin; but the balance of evidence does not favour this\r\nview. All the characteristic differences of the Cochin breed are more\r\nor less variable, and may be detected in a greater or lesser degree in\r\nother breeds. One sub-breed is coloured closely like _G. bankiva._ The\r\nfeathered legs, often furnished with an additional toe, the wings\r\nincapable of flight, the extremely quiet disposition, indicate a long\r\ncourse of domestication; and these fowls come from China, where we know\r\nthat plants and animals have been tended from a remote period with\r\nextraordinary care, and where consequently we might expect to find\r\nprofoundly modified domestic races.\r\n\r\n_Osteological Differences._—I have examined twenty-seven skeletons and\r\nfifty-three skulls of various breeds, including three of _G. bankiva_:\r\nnearly half of these skulls I owe to the kindness of Mr. Tegetmeier,\r\nand three of the skeletons to Mr. Eyton.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 33—Occipital Foramen of the Skulls of Fowls\r\n\r\nThe _Skull_ differs greatly in size in different breeds, being nearly\r\ntwice as long in the largest Cochins, but not nearly twice as broad, as\r\nin Bantams. The bones at the base, from the occipital foramen to the\r\nanterior end (including the quadrates and pterygoids), are absolutely\r\nidentical in _ shape_ in all the skulls. So is the lower jaw. In the\r\nforehead slight differences are often perceptible between the males and\r\nfemales, evidently caused by the presence of the comb. In every case I\r\ntake the skull of _G. bankiva_ as the standard of comparison. In four\r\nGames, in one Malay hen, in an African cock, in a Frizzled cock from\r\nMadras, in two black-boned Silk hens, no differences worth notice\r\noccur. In three _Spanish_ cocks, the form of the forehead between the\r\norbits differs considerably; in one it is considerably depressed,\r\nwhilst in the two others it is rather prominent, with a deep medial\r\nfurrow; the skull of the hen is smooth. In three skulls of _Sebright\r\nBantams_ the crown is more globular, and slopes more abruptly to the\r\nocciput, than in _ G. bankiva._ In a Bantam or Jumper from Burmah these\r\nsame characters are more strongly pronounced, and the supra-occiput is\r\nmore pointed. In a black Bantam the skull is not so globular, and the\r\noccipital foramen is very large, and has nearly the same sub-triangular\r\noutline presently to be described in Cochins; and in this skull the two\r\nascending branches of the premaxillary are overlapped in a singular\r\nmanner by the processes of the nasal bone, but, as I have seen only one\r\nspecimen, some of these differences may be individual. Of Cochins and\r\nBrahmas (the latter a crossed race approaching closely to Cochins) I\r\nhave examined seven skulls; at the point where the ascending branches\r\nof the premaxillary rest on the frontal bone the surface is much\r\ndepressed, and from this depression a deep medial furrow extends\r\nbackwards to a variable distance; the edges of this fissure are rather\r\nprominent, as is the top of the skull behind and over the orbits. These\r\ncharacters are less developed in the hens. The pterygoids, and the\r\nprocesses of the lower jaw, are broader, relatively to the size of the\r\nhead, than in _G. bankiva_; and this is likewise the case with Dorkings\r\nwhen of large size. The fork of the hyoid bone in Cochins is twice as\r\nwide as in _G. bankiva,_ whereas the length of the other hyoid bones is\r\nonly as three to two. But the most remarkable character is the shape of\r\nthe occipital foramen: in _G. bankiva_ (A) the breadth in a horizontal\r\nline exceeds the height in a vertical line, and the outline is nearly\r\ncircular; whereas in Cochins (B) the outline is sub-triangular, and the\r\nvertical line exceeds the horizontal line in length. This same form\r\nlikewise occurs in the black Bantam above referred to, and an approach\r\nto it may be seen in some Dorkings, and in a slight degree in certain\r\nother breeds.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 34—Skulls of Fowls\r\n\r\nOf _Dorkings_ I have examined three skulls, one belonging to the\r\nwhite-sub-breed; the one character deserving notice is the breadth of\r\nthe frontal bones, which are moderately furrowed in the middle; thus in\r\na skull which was less than once and a half the length of that of _G.\r\nbankiva,_ the breadth between the orbits was exactly double. Of\r\n_Hamburghs_ I have examined four skulls (male and female) of the\r\npencilled sub-breed, and one (male) of the spangled sub-breed; the\r\nnasal bones stand remarkably wide apart, but in a variable degree;\r\nconsequently narrow membrane-covered spaces are left between the tips\r\nof the two ascending branches of the pre-maxillary bones, which are\r\nrather short, and between these branches and the nasal bones. The\r\nsurface of the frontal bone, on which the branches of the premaxillary\r\nrest, is very little depressed. These peculiarities no doubt stand in\r\nclose relation with the broad, flattened rose-comb characteristic of\r\nthe Hamburgh breed.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 35—Longitudinal sections of Skulls of Fowls\r\n\r\nI have examined fourteen skulls of _ Polish and other crested breeds._\r\nTheir differences are extraordinary. First for nine skulls of different\r\nsub-breeds of English Polish fowls. The hemispherical protuberance of\r\nthe frontal bones[68] may be seen in fig. 34, in which (B) the skull of\r\na white-crested Polish fowl is shown obliquely from above, with the\r\nskull (A) of _G. bankiva_ in the same position. In fig. 35 longitudinal\r\nsections are given of the skull of a Polish fowl, and, for comparison,\r\nof a Cochin of the same size. The protuberance in all Polish fowls\r\noccupies the same position but differs much in size. In one of my nine\r\nspecimens it was extremely slight. The degree to which the protuberance\r\nis ossified varies greatly, larger or smaller portions of bone being\r\nreplaced by membrane. In one specimen there was only a single open\r\npore; generally, there are many variously shaped open spaces, the bone\r\nforming an irregular reticulation. A medial, longitudinal, arched\r\nribbon of bone is generally retained, but in one specimen there was no\r\nbone whatever over the whole protuberance, and the skull, when cleaned\r\nand viewed from above, presented the appearance of an open basin. The\r\nchange in the whole internal form of the skull is surprisingly great.\r\nThe brain is modified in a corresponding manner, as is shown in the two\r\nlongitudinal sections, which deserve attentive consideration. The upper\r\nand anterior cavity of the three into which the skull may be divided,\r\nis the one which is so greatly modified; it is evidently much larger\r\nthan in the Cochin skull of the same size, and extends much further\r\nbeyond the interorbital septum, but laterally is less deep. This\r\ncavity, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, is entirely filled with brain.\r\nIn the skull of the Cochin and of all ordinary fowls a strong internal\r\nridge of bone separates the anterior from the central cavity; but this\r\nridge is quite absent in the Polish skull here figured. The shape of\r\nthe central cavity is circular in the Polish, and lengthened in the\r\nCochin skull. The shape of the posterior cavity, together with the\r\nposition, size, and number of the pores for the nerves, differ much in\r\nthese two skulls. A pit deeply penetrating the occipital bone of the\r\nCochin is entirely absent in this Polish skull, whilst in another\r\nspecimen it was well developed. In this second specimen the whole\r\ninternal surface of the posterior cavity likewise differs to a certain\r\nextent in shape. I made sections of two other skulls,—namely, of a\r\nPolish fowl with the protuberance singularly little developed, and of a\r\nSultan in which it was a little more developed; and when these two\r\nskulls were placed between the two above figured (fig. 35), a perfect\r\ngradation in the configuration of each part of the internal surface\r\ncould be traced. In the Polish skull, with a small protuberance, the\r\nridge between the anterior and middle cavities was present, but low;\r\nand in the Sultan this ridge was replaced by a narrow furrow standing\r\non a broad raised eminence.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 36—Skulls of Horned Fowl\r\n\r\nIt may naturally be asked whether these remarkable modifications in the\r\nform of the brain affect the intellect of Polish fowls; some writers\r\nhave stated that they are extremely stupid, but Bechstein and Mr.\r\nTegetmeier have shown that this is by no means generally the case.\r\nNevertheless Bechstein[69] states that he had a Polish hen which “was\r\ncrazy, and anxiously wandered about all day long.” A hen in my\r\npossession was solitary in her habits, and was often so absorbed in\r\nreverie that she could be touched; she was also deficient in the most\r\nsingular manner in the faculty of finding her way, so that, if she\r\nstrayed a hundred yards from her feeding-place, she was completely\r\nlost, and would then obstinately try to proceed in a wrong direction. I\r\nhave received other and similar accounts of Polish fowls appearing\r\nstupid or half-idiotic.[70]\r\n\r\nTo return to the skull of Polish fowls. The posterior part, viewed\r\nexternally, differs little from that of _G. bankiva._ In most fowls the\r\nposterior-lateral process of the frontal bone and the process of the\r\nsquamosal bone run together and are ossified near their extremities:\r\nthis union of the two bones, however, is not constant in any breed; and\r\nin eleven out of fourteen skulls of crested breeds, these processes\r\nwere quite distinct. These processes, when not united, instead of being\r\ninclined anteriorly, as in all common breeds, descend at right angles\r\nto the lower jaw; and in this case the longer axis of the bony cavity\r\nof the ear is likewise more perpendicular, than in other breeds. When\r\nthe squamosal process is free instead of expanding at the tip, it is\r\nreduced to an extremely fine and pointed style, of variable length. The\r\npterygoid and quadrate bones present no differences. The palatine bones\r\nare a little more curved upwards at their posterior ends. The frontal\r\nbones, anteriorly to the protuberance, are, as in Dorkings, very broad,\r\nbut in a variable degree. The nasal bones either stand far apart, as in\r\nHamburghs, or almost touch each other, and in one instance were\r\nossified together. Each nasal bone properly sends out in front two long\r\nprocesses of equal lengths, forming a fork; but in all the Polish\r\nskulls, except one, the inner process was considerably, but in a\r\nvariable degree, shortened and somewhat upturned. In all the skulls,\r\nexcept one, the two ascending branches of the premaxillary, instead of\r\nrunning up between the processes of the nasal bones and resting on the\r\nethmoid bone, are much shortened and terminate in a blunt, somewhat\r\nupturned point. In those skulls in which the nasal bones approach quite\r\nclose to each other or are ossified together, it would be impossible\r\nfor the ascending branches of the premaxillary to reach the ethmoid and\r\nfrontal bones; hence we see that even the relative connection of the\r\nbones has been changed. Apparently in consequence of the branches of\r\nthe premaxillary and of the inner processes of the nasal bones being\r\nsomewhat upturned, the external orifices of the nostrils are upraised\r\nand assume a crescentic outline.\r\n\r\nI must still say a few words on some of the foreign Crested breeds. The\r\nskull of a crested, rumpless, white Turkish fowl was very slightly\r\nprotuberant, and but little perforated; the ascending branches of the\r\npremaxillary were well developed. In another Turkish breed, called\r\nGhoondooks, the skull was considerably protuberant and perforated; the\r\nascending branches of the premaxillary were so much aborted that they\r\nprojected only 1/15th of an inch; and the inner processes of the nasal\r\nbone were so completely aborted, that the surface where they should\r\nhave projected was quite smooth. Here then we see these two bones\r\nmodified to an extreme degree. Of Sultans (another Turkish breed) I\r\nexamined two skulls; in that of the female the protuberance was much\r\nlarger than in the male. In both skulls the ascending branches of the\r\npremaxillary were very short, and in both the nasal portion of the\r\ninner processes of the nasal bones were ossified together. These Sultan\r\nskulls differed from those of English Polish fowls in the frontal\r\nbones, anteriorly to the protuberance, not being broad.\r\n\r\nThe last skull which I need describe is a unique one, lent to me by Mr.\r\nTegetmeier: it resembles a Polish skull in most of its characters, but\r\nhas not the great frontal protuberance; it has, however, two rounded\r\nknobs of a different nature, which stand more in front, above the\r\nlachrymal bones. These curious knobs, into which the brain does not\r\nenter, are separated from each other by a deep medial furrow; and this\r\nis perforated by a few minute pores. The nasal bones stand rather wide\r\napart, with their inner processes, and the ascending branches of the\r\npremaxillary, upturned and shortened. The two knobs no doubt supported\r\nthe two great horn-like projections of the comb.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts we see in how astonishing a manner some of the\r\nbones of the skull vary in Crested fowls. The protuberance may\r\ncertainly be called in one sense a monstrosity, as being wholly unlike\r\nanything observed in nature: but as in ordinary cases it is not\r\ninjurious to the bird, and as it is strictly inherited, it can hardly\r\nin another sense be called a monstrosity. A series may be formed\r\ncommencing with the black-boned Silk fowl, which has a very small crest\r\nwith the skull beneath penetrated only by a few minute orifices, but\r\nwith no other change in its structure; and from this first stage we may\r\nproceed to fowls with a moderately large crest, which rests, according\r\nto Bechstein, on a fleshy mass, but without any protuberance in the\r\nskull. I may add that I have seen a similar fleshy or fibrous mass\r\nbeneath the tuft of feathers on the head of the Tufted duck; and in\r\nthis case there was no actual protuberance in the skull, but it had\r\nbecome a little more globular. Lastly, when we come to fowls with a\r\nlargely developed crest, the skull becomes largely protuberant and is\r\nperforated by a multitude of irregular open spaces. The close relation\r\nbetween the crest and the size of the bony protuberance is shown in\r\nanother way; for Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that if chickens lately\r\nhatched be selected with a large bony protuberance, when adult they\r\nwill have a large crest. There can be no doubt that in former times the\r\nbreeder of Polish fowls attended solely to the crest, and not to the\r\nskull; nevertheless, by increasing the crest, in which he has been\r\nwonderfully successful, he has unintentionally made the skull\r\nprotuberant to an astonishing degree; and through correlation of\r\ngrowth, he has at the same time affected the form and relative\r\nconnexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the shape of the orifice\r\nof the nose, the breadth of the frontal bones, the shape of the\r\npost-lateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones, the\r\ndirection of the axis of the bony cavity of the ear, and lastly the\r\ninternal configuration of the whole skull together with the shape of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 37—Sixth Cervical Verterbra of Fowls\r\n\r\n_Vertebræ._—In _G. bankiva_ there are fourteen cervical, seven dorsal\r\nwith ribs, apparently fifteen lumbar and sacral, and six caudal\r\nvertebræ;[71] but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed that I\r\nam not sure of their number, and this makes the comparison of the total\r\nnumber of vertebræ in the several breeds difficult. I have spoken of\r\nsix caudal vertebræ, because the basal one is almost completely\r\nanchylosed with the pelvis; but if we consider the number as seven, the\r\ncaudal vertebræ agree in all the skeletons. The cervical vertebræ are,\r\nas just stated, in appearance fourteen; but out of twenty-three\r\nskeletons in a fit state for examination, in five of them, namely, in\r\ntwo Games, in two pencilled Hamburghs, and in a Polish, the fourteenth\r\nvertebra bore ribs, which, though small, were perfectly developed with\r\na double articulation. The presence of these little ribs cannot be\r\nconsidered as a fact of much importance, for all the cervical vertebræ\r\nbear representatives of ribs; but their development in the fourteenth\r\nvertebra reduces the size of the passages in the transverse processes,\r\nand makes this vertebra exactly like the first dorsal vertebra. The\r\naddition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical\r\nalone, for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are\r\ndestitute of processes; but in some of the skeletons in which the\r\nfourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair of true ribs had\r\nwell-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow has only nine,\r\nand the swan twenty-three cervical vertebræ,[72] we need feel no\r\nsurprise at the number of the cervical vertebræ in the fowl being, as\r\nit appears, variable.\r\n\r\nThere are seven dorsal vertebræ bearing ribs; the first dorsal is never\r\nanchylosed with the succeeding four, which are generally anchylosed\r\ntogether. In one Sultan fowl, however, the two first dorsal vertebræ\r\nwere free. In two skeletons, the fifth dorsal was free; generally the\r\nsixth is free (as in _G. bankiva_), but sometimes only at its posterior\r\nend, where in contact with the seventh. The seventh dorsal vertebra, in\r\nevery case excepting in one Spanish cock, was anchylosed with the\r\nlumbar vertebræ. So that the degree to which these middle dorsal\r\nvertebræ are anchylosed is variable.\r\n\r\nSeven is the normal number of true ribs, but in two skeletons of the\r\nSultan fowl (in which the fourteenth cervical vertebra was not\r\nfurnished with little ribs) there were eight pairs; the eighth pair\r\nseemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first\r\nlumbar in _G. bankiva_; the sternal portion of both the seventh and\r\neighth ribs did not reach the sternum. In four skeletons in which ribs\r\nwere developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra, there were, when\r\nthese cervical ribs are included, eight pairs; but in one Game cock, in\r\nwhich the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs, there were only\r\nsix pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in this case did not have\r\nprocesses, and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons; in\r\nthis Game cock, as far as could be judged from the appearance of the\r\nlumbar vertebræ, a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was missing. We\r\nthus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair attached to the\r\nfourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from six to eight pair.\r\nThe sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes. The sternal\r\nportion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in Cochins, and is\r\ncompletely ossified. As previously stated, it is scarcely possible to\r\ncount the lumbo-sacral vertebræ; but they certainly do not correspond\r\nin shape or number in the several skeletons. The caudal vertebræ are\r\nclosely similar in all the skeletons, the only difference being whether\r\nor not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly vary even\r\nin length, not being shorter in Cochins, with their short\r\ntail-feathers, than in other breeds; in a Spanish cock, however, the\r\ncaudal vertebræ were a little elongated. In three rumpless fowls the\r\ncaudal vertebræ were few in number, and anchylosed together into a\r\nmisformed mass.\r\n\r\nIn the individual vertebræ the differences in structure are very\r\nslight. In the atlas the cavity for the occipital condyle is either\r\nossified into a ring, or is, as in Bankiva, open on its upper margin.\r\nThe upper arc of the spinal canal is a little more arched in Cochins,\r\nin conformity with the shape of the occipital foramen, than in _G.\r\nbankiva._ In several skeletons a difference, but not of much\r\nimportance, may be observed, which commences at the fourth cervical\r\nvertebra, and is greatest at about the sixth, seventh, or eighth\r\nvertebra; this consists in the hæmal descending processes being united\r\nto the body of the vertebra by a sort of buttress. This structure may\r\nbe observed in Cochins, Polish, some Hamburghs, and probably other\r\nbreeds; but is absent, or barely developed, in Game, Dorking, Spanish,\r\nBantam, and several other breeds examined by me. On the dorsal surface\r\nof the sixth cervical vertebra in Cochins three prominent points are\r\nmore strongly developed than in the corresponding vertebra of the Game\r\nfowl or _G. bankiva._\r\n\r\n_Pelvis._—This differs in some few points in the several skeletons. The\r\nanterior margin of the ilium seems at first to vary much in outline,\r\nbut this is chiefly due to the degree to which the margin in the middle\r\npart is ossified to the crest of the vertebræ; the outline, however,\r\ndoes differ in being more truncated in Bantams, and more rounded in\r\ncertain breeds, as in Cochins. The outline of the ischiadic foramen\r\ndiffers considerably, being nearly circular in Bantams, instead of\r\negg-shaped as in the Bankiva, and more regularly oval in some\r\nskeletons, as in the Spanish. The obturator notch is also much less\r\nelongated in some skeletons than in others. The end of the pubic bone\r\npresents the greatest difference; being hardly enlarged in the Bankiva;\r\nconsiderably and gradually enlarged in Cochins, and in a lesser degree\r\nin some other breeds; and abruptly enlarged in Bantams. In one Bantam\r\nthis bone extended very little beyond the extremity of the ischium. The\r\nwhole pelvis in this latter bird differed widely in its proportions,\r\nbeing far broader proportionally to its length than in Bankiva.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 38—Extremity of the Furcula of Fowls\r\n\r\n_Sternum._—This bone is generally so much deformed that it is scarcely\r\npossible to compare its shape strictly in the several breeds. The form\r\nof the triangular extremity of the lateral processes differs\r\nconsiderably, being either almost equilateral or much elongated. The\r\nfront margin of the crest is more or less perpendicular and varies\r\ngreatly, as does the curvature of the posterior end, and the flatness\r\nof the lower surface. The outline of the manubrial process also varies,\r\nbeing wedge-shaped in the Bankiva, and rounded in the Spanish breed.\r\nThe _furculum_ differs in being more or less arched, and greatly, as\r\nmay be seen in the accompanying outlines, in the shape of the terminal\r\nplate; but the shape of this part differed a little in two skeletons of\r\nthe wild Bankiva. The _coracoid_ presents no difference worth notice.\r\nThe _scapula_ varies in shape, being of nearly uniform breadth in\r\nBankiva, much broader in the middle in the Polish fowl, and abruptly\r\nnarrowed towards the apex in the two Sultan fowls.\r\n\r\nI carefully compared each separate bone of the leg and wing, relatively\r\nto the same bones in the wild Bankiva, in the following breeds, which I\r\nthought were the most likely to differ; namely, in Cochin, Dorking,\r\nSpanish, Polish, Burmese Bantam, Frizzled Indian, and black-boned Silk\r\nfowls; and it was truly surprising to see how absolutely every process,\r\narticulation, and pore agreed, though the bones differed greatly in\r\nsize. The agreement is far more absolute than in other parts of the\r\nskeleton. In stating this, I do not refer to the relative thickness and\r\nlength of the several bones; for the tarsi varied considerably in both\r\nthese respects. But the other limb-bones varied little even in relative\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have not examined a sufficient number of skeletons to say\r\nwhether any of the foregoing differences, except in the skull, are\r\ncharacteristic of the several breeds. Apparently some differences are\r\nmore common in certain breeds than in others,—as an additional rib to\r\nthe fourteenth cervical vertebra in Hamburghs and Games, and the\r\nbreadth of the end of the pubic bone in Cochins. Both skeletons of the\r\nSultan fowl had eight dorsal vertebræ, and the end of the scapula in\r\nboth was somewhat attenuated. In the skull, the deep medial furrow in\r\nthe frontal bones and the vertically elongated occipital foramen seem\r\nto be characteristic of Cochins; as is the great breadth of the frontal\r\nbones in Dorkings; the separation and open spaces between the tips of\r\nthe ascending branches of the premaxillaries and nasal bones, as well\r\nas the front part of the skull being but little depressed, characterise\r\nHamburghs; the globular shape of the posterior part of the skull seems\r\nto be characteristic of laced Bantams; and lastly, the protuberance of\r\nthe skull with the ascending branches of the premaxillaries partially\r\naborted, together with the other differences before specified, are\r\neminently characteristic of Polish and other Crested fowls.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking result of my examination of the skeleton is the\r\ngreat variability of all the bones except those of the extremities. To\r\na certain extent we can understand why the skeleton fluctuates so much\r\nin structure; fowls have been exposed to unnatural conditions of life,\r\nand their whole organisation has thus been rendered variable; but the\r\nbreeder is quite indifferent to, and never intentionally selects, any\r\nmodification in the skeleton. External characters, if not attended to\r\nby man, such as the number of the tail and wing feathers and their\r\nrelative lengths, which in wild birds are generally constant,—fluctuate\r\nin our domestic fowls in the same manner as the several parts of the\r\nskeleton. An additional toe is a “point” in Dorkings, and has become a\r\nfixed character, but is variable in Cochins and Silk fowls. The colour\r\nof the plumage and the form of the comb are in most breeds, or even\r\nsub-breeds, eminently fixed characters; but in Dorkings these points\r\nhave not been attended to, and are variable. When any modification in\r\nthe skeleton is related to some external character which man values, it\r\nhas been, unintentionally on his part, acted on by selection, and has\r\nbecome more or less fixed. We see this in the wonderful protuberance of\r\nthe skull, which supports the crest of feathers in Polish fowls, and\r\nwhich by correlation has affected other parts of the skull. We see the\r\nsame result in the two protuberances which support the horns in the\r\nhorned fowl, and in the flattened shape of the front of the skull in\r\nHamburghs consequent on their flattened and broad “rose-combs.” We know\r\nnot in the least whether additional ribs, or the changed outline of the\r\noccipital foramen, or the changed form of the scapula, or of the\r\nextremity of the furculum, are in any way correlated with other\r\nstructures, or have arisen from the changed conditions and habits of\r\nlife to which our fowls have been subjected; but there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that these various modifications in the skeleton could be\r\nrendered, either by direct selection, or by the selection of correlated\r\nstructures, as constant and as characteristic of each breed, as are the\r\nsize and shape of the body, the colour of the plumage, and the form of\r\nthe comb.\r\n\r\n     _Effects of the Disuse of Parts._\r\n\r\nJudging from the habits of our European gallinaceous birds, _Gallus\r\nbankiva_ in its native haunts would use its legs and wings more than do\r\nour domestic fowls, which rarely fly except to their roosts. The Silk\r\nand the Frizzled fowls, from having imperfect wing-feathers, cannot fly\r\nat all; and there is reason to believe that both these breeds are\r\nancient, so that their progenitors during many generations cannot have\r\nflown. The Cochins, also, from their short wings and heavy bodies, can\r\nhardly fly up to a low perch. Therefore in these breeds, especially in\r\nthe two first, a considerable diminution in the wing-bones might have\r\nbeen expected, but this is not the case. In every specimen, after\r\ndisarticulating and cleaning the bones, I carefully compared the\r\nrelative length of the two main bones of the wing to each other, and of\r\nthe two main bones of the leg to each other, with those of _G.\r\nbankiva_; and it was surprising to see (except in the case of the\r\ntarsi) how exactly the same relative length had been retained. This\r\nfact is curious, from showing how truly the proportions of an organ may\r\nbe inherited, although not fully exercised during many generations. I\r\nthen compared in several breeds the length of the femur and tibia with\r\nthe humerus and ulna, and likewise these same bones with those of _G.\r\nbankiva_; the result was that the wing-bones in all the breeds (except\r\nthe Burmese Jumper, which has unnaturally short legs, are slightly\r\nshortened relatively to the leg-bones; but the decrease is so slight\r\nthat it may be due to the standard specimen of _G. bankiva_ having\r\naccidentally had wings of slightly greater length than usual; so that\r\nthe measurements are not worth giving. But it deserves notice that the\r\nSilk and Frizzled fowls, which are quite incapable of flight, had their\r\nwings _less_ reduced relatively to their legs than in almost any other\r\nbreed! We have seen with domesticated pigeons that the bones of the\r\nwings are somewhat reduced in length, whilst the primary feathers are\r\nrather increased in length, and it is just possible, though not\r\nprobable, that in the Silk and Frizzled fowls any tendency to decrease\r\nin the length of the wing-bones from disuse may have been checked\r\nthrough the law of compensation, by the decreased growth of the\r\nwing-feathers, and consequent increased supply of nutriment. The\r\nwing-bones, however, in both these breeds, are found to be slightly\r\nreduced in length when judged by the standard of the length of the\r\nsternum or head, relatively to these same parts in _G. bankiva._\r\n\r\nThe actual weight of the main bones of the leg and wing in twelve\r\nbreeds is given in the two first columns in Table I. The calculated\r\nweight of the wing-bones relatively to the leg-bones, in comparison\r\nwith the leg and wing-bones of _G. bankiva,_ are given in the third\r\ncolumn,—the weight of the wing-bones in _G. bankiva_ being called a\r\nhundred.[73]\r\n\r\nTable I.\r\n\r\nNames of Breeds.

In the next four birds, including the Silk\r\nhen, which is incapable of flight, we see that the wings, relatively to\r\nthe legs, are slightly increased in weight; but it should be observed\r\nthat, if in these birds the legs had become from any cause reduced in\r\nweight, this would give the false appearance of the wings having\r\nincreased in relative weight. Now a reduction of this nature has\r\ncertainly occurred with the Burmese Jumper, in which the legs are\r\nabnormally short, and in the two Hamburghs and Silk fowl, the legs,\r\nthough not short, are formed of remarkably thin and light bones. I make\r\nthese statements, not judging by mere eyesight, but after having\r\ncalculated the weights of the leg-bones relatively to those of G.\r\nbankiva, according to the only two standards of comparison which I\r\ncould use, namely, the relative lengths of the head and sternum; for I\r\ndo not know the weight of the body in _G. bankiva,_ which would have\r\nbeen a better standard. According to these standards, the leg-bones in\r\nthese four fowls are in a marked manner far lighter than in any other\r\nbreed. It may therefore be concluded that in all cases in which the\r\nlegs have not been through some unknown cause much reduced in weight,\r\nthe wing-bones have become reduced in weight relatively to the\r\nleg-bones, in comparison with those of _G. bankiva._ And this reduction\r\nof weight may, I apprehend, safely be attributed to disuse.\r\n\r\nTo make Table I quite satisfactory, it ought to have been shown that in\r\nthe eight first birds the leg-bones have not actually increased in\r\nweight out of due proportion with the rest of the body; this I cannot\r\nshow, from not knowing, as already remarked, the weight of the wild\r\nBankiva.[74] I am indeed inclined to suspect that the leg-bones in the\r\nDorking, No. 2 in the table, are proportionally too heavy; but this\r\nbird was a very large one, weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces, though very\r\nthin. Its leg-bones were more than ten times as heavy as those of the\r\nBurmese Jumper! I tried to ascertain the length both of the leg-bones\r\nand wing-bones relatively to other parts of the body and skeleton: but\r\nthe whole organisation in these birds, which have been so long\r\ndomesticated, has become so variable, that no certain conclusions could\r\nbe reached. For instance, the legs of the above Dorking cock were\r\nnearly three-quarters of an inch too short relatively to the length of\r\nthe sternum, and more than three-quarters of an inch too long\r\nrelatively to the length of the skull, in comparison with these same\r\nparts in _G. bankiva._\r\n\r\nTable II.\r\n\r\nNames of Breeds.

In the third column we have the\r\ncalculated depth of the crest, relatively to the length of the sternum,\r\nin comparison with these same parts in _G. bankiva._[75]\r\n\r\nBy looking to the third column we see that in every case the depth of\r\nthe crest relatively to the length of the sternum, in comparison with\r\n_G. bankiva,_ is diminished, generally between 10 and 20 per cent. But\r\nthe degree of reduction varies much, partly in consequence of the\r\nfrequently deformed state of the sternum. In the Silk fowl, which\r\ncannot fly, the crest is 34 per cent less deep than what it ought to\r\nhave been. This reduction of the crest in all the breeds probably\r\naccounts for the great variability, before referred to, in the\r\ncurvature of the furculum, and in the shape of its sternal extremity.\r\nMedical men believe that the abnormal form of the spine so commonly\r\nobserved in women of the higher ranks results from the attached muscles\r\nnot being fully exercised. So it is with our domestic fowls, for they\r\nuse their pectoral muscles but little, and, out of twenty-five sternums\r\nexamined by me, three alone were perfectly symmetrical, ten were\r\nmoderately crooked, and twelve were deformed to an extreme degree. Mr.\r\nRomanes, however, believes that the malformation is due to fowls whilst\r\nyoung resting their sternums on the sticks on which they roost.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may conclude with respect to the various breeds of the\r\nfowl, that the main bones of the wing have probably been shortened in a\r\nvery slight degree; that they have certainly become lighter relatively\r\nto the leg-bones in all the breeds in which these latter bones are not\r\nunnaturally short or delicate; and that the crest of the sternum, to\r\nwhich the pectoral muscles are attached, has invariably become less\r\nprominent, the whole sternum being also extremely liable to deformity.\r\nThese results we may attribute to the lessened use of the wings.\r\n\r\n_Correlation of Growth._—I will here sum up the few facts which I have\r\ncollected on this obscure, but important, subject. In Cochin and Game\r\nfowls there is perhaps some relation between the colour of the plumage\r\nand the darkness of the egg-shell. In Sultans the additional\r\nsickle-feathers in the tail are apparently related to the general\r\nredundancy of the plumage, as shown by the feathered legs, large crest,\r\nand beard. In two tailless fowls which I examined the oil-gland was\r\naborted. A large crest of feathers, as Mr. Tegetmeier has remarked,\r\nseems always accompanied by a great diminution or almost entire absence\r\nof the comb. A large beard is similarly accompanied by diminished or\r\nabsent wattles. These latter cases apparently come under the law of\r\ncompensation or balancement of growth. A large beard beneath the lower\r\njaw and a large top-knot on the skull often go together. The comb when\r\nof any peculiar shape, as with Horned, Spanish, and Hamburgh fowls,\r\naffects in a corresponding manner the underlying skull; and we have\r\nseen how wonderfully this is the case with Crested fowls when the crest\r\nis largely developed. With the protuberance of the frontal bones the\r\nshape of the internal surface of the skull and of the brain is greatly\r\nmodified. The presence of a crest influences in some unknown way the\r\ndevelopment of the ascending branches of the premaxillary bone, and of\r\nthe inner processes of the nasal bones; and likewise the shape of the\r\nexternal orifice of the nostrils. There is a plain and curious\r\ncorrelation between a crest of feathers and the imperfectly ossified\r\ncondition of the skull. Not only does this hold good with nearly all\r\ncrested fowls, but likewise with tufted ducks, and as Dr. Gunther\r\ninforms me with tufted geese in Germany.\r\n\r\nLastly, the feathers composing the crest in male Polish fowls resemble\r\nhackles, and differ greatly in shape from those in the crest of the\r\nfemale. The neck, wing-coverts, and loins in the male bird are properly\r\ncovered with hackles, and it would appear that feathers of this shape\r\nhave spread by correlation to the head of the male. This little fact is\r\ninteresting; because, though both sexes of some wild gallinaceous birds\r\nhave their heads similarly ornamented, yet there is often a difference\r\nin the size and shape of feathers forming their crests. Furthermore,\r\nthere is in some cases, as in the male Gold and in the male Amherst\r\npheasants (_P. pictus_ and _amherstiæ_), a close relation in colour, as\r\nwell as in structure, between the plumes on the head and on the loins.\r\nIt would therefore appear that the same law has regulated the state of\r\nthe feathers on the head and body, both with species living under\r\nnatural conditions, and with birds which have varied under\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] I have drawn up this brief synopsis from various sources, but\r\n chiefly from information given me by Mr. Tegetmeier. This gentleman\r\n has kindly looked through this chapter; and from his well-known\r\n knowledge, the statements here given may be fully trusted. Mr.\r\n Tegetmeier has likewise assisted me in every possible way in obtaining\r\n for me information and specimens.

Hist.,’ vol. xx., 1847, p. 388.\r\n\r\n [26] ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1851, p. 619.\r\n\r\n [27] I have consulted an eminent authority, Mr. Sclater, on this\r\n subject, and he thinks that I have not expressed myself too strongly.\r\n I am aware that one ancient author, Acosta, speaks of fowls as having\r\n inhabited S. America at the period of its discovery; and more\r\n recently, about 1795, Olivier de Serres speaks of wild fowls in the\r\n forests of Guiana; these were probably feral birds. Dr. Daniell tells\r\n me, he believes that fowls have become wild on the west coast of\r\n Equatorial Africa; they may, however, not be true fowls, but\r\n gallinaceous birds belonging to the genus Phasidus. The old voyager\r\n Barbut says that poultry are not natural to Guinea. Capt. W. Allen\r\n (‘Narrative of Niger Expedition,’ 1848, vol. ii. p. 42) describes wild\r\n fowls on Ilha dos Rollas, an island near St. Thomas’s on the west\r\n coast of Africa; the natives informed him that they had escaped from a\r\n vessel wrecked there many years ago; they were extremely wild and had\r\n “a cry quite different to that of the domestic fowl,” and their\r\n appearance was somewhat changed. Hence it is not a little doubtful,\r\n notwithstanding the statement of the natives, whether these birds\r\n really were fowls. That the fowl has become feral on several islands\r\n is certain. Mr. Fry, a very capable judge, informed Mr. Layard, in a\r\n letter, that the fowls which have run wild on Ascension “had nearly\r\n all got back to their primitive colours, red, and black cocks, and\r\n smoky-grey hens.” But unfortunately we do not know the colour of the\r\n poultry which were turned out. Fowls have become feral on the Nicobar\r\n Islands (Blyth in the ‘Indian Field,’ 1858, p. 62), and in the\r\n Ladrones (Anson’s Voyage). Those found in the Pellew Islands\r\n (Crawfurd) are believed to be feral; and lastly, it is asserted that\r\n they have become feral in New Zealand, but whether this is correct I\r\n know not.\r\n\r\n [28] Mr. Hewitt, in ‘The Poultry Book,’ by W.

Dr.\r\n Pickering, in his ‘Races of Man,’ 1850, p. 374, says that the head and\r\n neck of a fowl is carried in a Tribute-procession to Thoutmousis III.\r\n (1445 B.C.); but Mr. Birch of the British Museum doubts whether the\r\n figure can be identified as the head of a fowl. Some caution is\r\n necessary with reference to the absence of figures of the fowl on the\r\n ancient Egyptian monuments, on account of the strong and widely\r\n prevalent prejudice against this bird. I am informed by the Rev. S.\r\n Erhardt that on the east coast of Africa, from 4° to 6° south of the\r\n equator, most of the pagan tribes at the present day hold the fowl in\r\n aversion. The natives of the Pellew Islands would not eat the fowl nor\r\n will the Indians in some parts of S. America.

We thus get the series of 62, 52, 44 for the\r\n relative weights of the wing-bones in _G. bankiva,_ Cochins, Dorkings,\r\n etc. And now taking 100, instead of 62, for the weight of the\r\n wing-bones in _G. bankiva,_ we get, by another rule of three, 83 as\r\n the weight of the wing-bones in Cochins; 70 in the Dorkings; and so on\r\n for the remainder of the third column in the table.\r\n\r\n [74] Mr. Blyth (in ‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.,’ 2nd series, vol.\r\n i., 1848, p. 456) gives 3¼ pounds as the weight of a full-grown male\r\n _G. bankiva_; but from what I have seen of the skins and skeletons of\r\n various breeds, I cannot believe that my two specimens of _G. bankiva_\r\n could have weighed so much.\r\n\r\n [75] The third column is calculated on the same principle as explained\r\n in footnote 73 above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nDUCK—GOOSE—PEACOCK—TURKEY—GUINEA-FOWL—CANARY-BIRD—GOLD-FISH—RIVER-BEES—\r\nSILK-MOTHS.\r\n\r\nDUCKS, SEVERAL BREEDS OF—PROGRESS OF DOMESTICATION—ORIGIN OF FROM THE\r\nCOMMON WILD-DUCK—DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT BREEDS—OSTEOLOGICAL\r\nDIFFERENCES—EFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE ON THE LIMB-BONES.\r\n\r\nGOOSE, ANCIENTLY DOMESTICATED—LITTLE VARIATION OF—SEBASTOPOL BREED.\r\n\r\nPEACOCK, ORIGIN OF BLACK-SHOULDERED BREED.\r\n\r\nTURKEY,BREEDS OF—CROSSED WITH THE UNITED STATES SPECIES—EFFECTS OF\r\nCLIMATE ON.\r\n\r\nGUINEA-FOWL, CANARY-BIRD, GOLD-FISH, HIVE-BEES.\r\n\r\nSILK-MOTHS, SPECIES AND BREEDS OF—ANCIENTLY DOMESTICATED—CARE IN THEIR\r\nSELECTION—DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT RACES—IN THE EGG, CATERPILLAR,\r\nAND COCOON STATES—INHERITANCE OF CHARACTERS—IMPERFECT WINGS—LOST\r\nINSTINCTS—CORRELATED CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will, as in previous cases, first briefly describe the chief domestic\r\nbreeds of the duck:—\r\n\r\nBREED 1. _Common Domestic Duck._—Varies much in colour and in\r\nproportions, and differs in instincts and disposition from the wild\r\nduck. There are several sub-breeds:—(1) The Aylesbury, of great size,\r\nwhite, with pale-yellow beak and legs; abdominal dermal sack largely\r\ndeveloped. (2) The Rouen, of great size, coloured like the wild duck,\r\nwith green or mottled beak; dermal sack largely developed. (3) Tufted\r\nDuck, with a large top-knot of fine downy feathers, supported on a\r\nfleshy mass, with the skull perforated beneath. The top-knot in a duck\r\nwhich I imported from Holland was two and a half inches in diameter.\r\n(4) Labrador (or Canadian, or Buenos Ayres, or East Indian); plumage\r\nentirely black; beak broader, relatively to its length, than in the\r\nwild duck; eggs slightly tinted with black. This sub-breed perhaps\r\nought to be ranked as a breed; it includes two sub-varieties, one as\r\nlarge as the common domestic duck, which I have kept alive, and the\r\nother smaller and often capable of flight.[1] I presume it is this\r\nlatter sub-variety which has been described in France[2] as flying\r\nwell, being rather wild, and when cooked having the flavour of the wild\r\nduck; nevertheless this sub-variety is polygamous, like other\r\ndomesticated ducks and unlike the wild duck. These black Labrador ducks\r\nbreed true; but a case is given by Dr. Turral of the French sub-variety\r\nproducing young with some white feathers on the head and neck, and with\r\nan ochre-coloured patch on the breast.\r\n\r\nBREED 2. _Hook-billed Duck._—This bird presents an extraordinary\r\nappearance from the downward curvature of the beak. The head is often\r\ntufted. The common colour is white, but some are coloured like wild\r\nducks. It is an ancient breed, having been noticed in 1676.[3] It shows\r\nits prolonged domestication by almost incessantly laying eggs, like the\r\nfowls which are called everlasting layers.[4]\r\n\r\nBREED 3. _Call Duck._—Remarkable from its small size, and from the\r\nextraordinary loquacity of the female. Beak short. These birds are\r\neither white, or coloured like the wild duck.\r\n\r\nBREED 4. _Penguin Duck._—This is the most remarkable of all the breeds,\r\nand seems to have originated in the Malayan archipelago. It walks with\r\nits body extremely erect, and with its thin neck stretched straight\r\nupwards. Beak rather short. Tail upturned, including only 18 feathers.\r\nFemur and metatarsus elongated.\r\n\r\nAlmost all naturalists admit that the several breeds are descended from\r\nthe common wild duck (_Anas boschas_); most fanciers, on the other\r\nhand, take as usual a very different view.[5] Unless we deny that\r\ndomestication, prolonged during centuries, can affect even such\r\nunimportant characters as colour, size, and in a slight degree\r\nproportional dimensions and mental disposition, there is no reason\r\nwhatever to doubt that the domestic duck is descended from the common\r\nwild species, for the one differs from the other in no important\r\ncharacter. We have some historical evidence with respect to the period\r\nand progress of the domestication of the duck. It was unknown[6] to the\r\nancient Egyptians, to the Jews of the Old Testament, and to the Greeks\r\nof the Homeric period. About eighteen centuries ago Columella[7] and\r\nVarro speak of the necessity of keeping ducks in netted enclosures like\r\nother wild fowl, so that at this period there was danger of their\r\nflying away. Moreover, the plan recommended by Columella to those who\r\nwish to increase their stock of ducks, namely, to collect the eggs of\r\nthe wild bird and to place them under a hen, shows, as Mr. Dixon\r\nremarks, “that the duck had not at this time become a naturalised and\r\nprolific inmate of the Roman poultry-yard.” The origin of the domestic\r\nduck from the wild species is recognised in nearly every language of\r\nEurope, as Aldrovandi long ago remarked, by the same name being applied\r\nto both. The wild duck has a wide range from the Himalayas to North\r\nAmerica. It crosses readily with the domestic bird, and the crossed\r\noffspring are perfectly fertile.\r\n\r\nBoth in North America and Europe the wild duck has been found easy to\r\ntame and breed. In Sweden this experiment was carefully tried by\r\nTiburtius; he succeeded in rearing wild ducks for three generations,\r\nbut, though they were treated like common ducks, they did not vary even\r\nin a single feather. The young birds suffered from being allowed to\r\nswim about in cold water,[8] as is known to be the case, though the\r\nfact is a strange one, with the young of the common domestic duck. An\r\naccurate and well-known observer in England[9] has described in detail\r\nhis often repeated and successful experiments in domesticating the wild\r\nduck. Young birds are easily reared from eggs hatched under a bantam;\r\nbut to succeed it is indispensable not to place the eggs of both the\r\nwild and tame duck under the same hen, for in this case “the young wild\r\nducks die off, leaving their more hardy brethren in undisturbed\r\npossession of their foster-mother’s care. The difference of habit at\r\nthe onset in the newly-hatched ducklings almost entails such a result\r\nto a certainty.” The wild ducklings were from the first quite tame\r\ntowards those who took care of them as long as they wore the same\r\nclothes, and likewise to the dogs and cats of the house. They would\r\neven snap with their beaks at the dogs, and drive them away from any\r\nspot which they coveted. But they were much alarmed at strange men and\r\ndogs. Differently from what occurred in Sweden, Mr. Hewitt found that\r\nhis young birds always changed and deteriorated in character in the\r\ncourse of two or three generations; notwithstanding that great care was\r\ntaken to prevent their crossing with tame ducks. After the third\r\ngeneration his birds lost the elegant carriage of the wild species, and\r\nbegan to acquire the gait of the common duck. They increased in size in\r\neach generation, and their legs became less fine. The white collar\r\nround the neck of the mallard became broader and less regular, and some\r\nof the longer primary wing-feathers became more or less white. When\r\nthis occurred, Mr. Hewitt destroyed nearly the whole of his stock and\r\nprocured fresh eggs from wild nests; so that he never bred the same\r\nfamily for more than five or six generations. His birds continued to\r\npair together, and never became polygamous like the common domestic\r\nduck. I have given these details, because no other case, as far as I\r\nknow, has been so carefully recorded by a competent observer of the\r\nprogress of change in wild birds reared for several generations in a\r\ndomestic condition.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations there can hardly be a doubt that the wild\r\nduck is the parent of the common domestic kind; nor need we look to\r\nother species for the parentage of the more distinct breeds, namely,\r\nPenguin, Call, Hook-billed, Tufted, and Labrador ducks. I will not\r\nrepeat the arguments used in the previous chapters on the improbability\r\nof man having in ancient times domesticated several species since\r\nbecome unknown or extinct, though ducks are not readily exterminated in\r\nthe wild state;—on some of the supposed parent-species having had\r\nabnormal characters in comparison with all the other species of the\r\ngenus, as with Hook-billed and Penguin ducks;—on all the breeds, as far\r\nas is known being fertile together;[10]—on all the breeds having the\r\nsame general disposition, instinct, etc. But one fact bearing on this\r\nquestion may be noticed: in the great duck family, one species alone,\r\nnamely, the male of _A. boschas,_ has its four middle tail-feathers\r\ncurled upwardly; now in every one of the above-named domestic breeds\r\nthese curled feathers exist, and on the supposition that they are\r\ndescended from distinct species, we must assume that man formerly hit\r\nupon species all of which had this now unique character. Moreover,\r\nsub-varieties of each breed are coloured almost exactly like the wild\r\nduck, as I have seen with the largest and smallest breeds, namely\r\nRouens and Call ducks, and, as Mr. Brent states,[11] is the case with\r\nHook-billed ducks. This gentleman, as he informs me, crossed a white\r\nAylesbury drake and a black Labrador duck, and some of the ducklings as\r\nthey grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Penguins, I have not seen many specimens, and none were\r\ncoloured precisely like the wild duck; but Sir James Brooke sent me\r\nthree skins from Lombok and Bali, in the Malayan archipelago; the two\r\nfemales were paler and more rufous than the wild duck, and the drake\r\ndiffered in having the whole under and upper surface (excepting the\r\nneck, tail-coverts, tail, and wings) silver-grey, finely pencilled with\r\ndark lines, closely like certain parts of the plumage of the wild\r\nmallard. But I found this drake to be identical in every feather with a\r\nvariety of the common breed procured from a farm-yard in Kent, and I\r\nhave occasionally elsewhere seen similar specimens. The occurrence of a\r\nduck bred under so peculiar a climate as that of the Malayan\r\narchipelago, where the wild species does not exist, with exactly the\r\nsame plumage as may occasionally be seen in our farm-yards, is a fact\r\nworth notice. Nevertheless the climate of the Malayan archipelago\r\napparently tends to cause the duck to vary much, for Zollinger,[12]\r\nspeaking of the Penguin breed, says that in Lombok “there is an unusual\r\nand very wonderful variety of ducks.” One Penguin drake which I kept\r\nalive differed from those of which the skins were sent me from Lombok,\r\nin having its breast and back partially coloured with chestnut-brown,\r\nthus more closely resembling the Mallard.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts, more especially from the drakes of all the\r\nbreeds having curled tail-feathers, and from certain sub-varieties in\r\neach breed occasionally resembling in general plumage the wild duck, we\r\nmay conclude with confidence that all the breeds are descended from _A.\r\nboschas._\r\n\r\nI will now notice some of the peculiarities characteristic of the\r\nseveral breeds. The eggs vary in colour; some common ducks laying\r\npale-greenish and others quite white eggs. The eggs which are first\r\nlaid during each season by the black Labrador duck, are tinted black,\r\nas if rubbed with ink. A good observer assured me that one year his\r\nducks of this breed laid almost perfectly white eggs. Another curious\r\ncase shows what singular variations sometimes occur and are inherited;\r\nMr. Hansell[13] relates that he had a common duck which always laid\r\neggs with the yolk of a dark-brown colour like melted glue; and the\r\nyoung ducks, hatched from these eggs, laid the same kind of eggs, so\r\nthat the breed had to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig 39—Skulls of Ducks, viewed laterally.\r\nA. Wild Duck. B. Hook-billed Duck.\r\n\r\nThe Hook-billed duck is highly remarkable (see fig. 39, of skull); and\r\nits peculiar beak has been inherited at least since the year 1676. This\r\nstructure is evidently analogous with that described in the Bagadotten\r\ncarrier pigeon. Mr. Brent[14] says that, when Hook-billed ducks are\r\ncrossed with common ducks, “many young ones are produced with the upper\r\nmandible shorter than the lower, which not unfrequently causes the\r\ndeath of the bird.” With ducks a tuft of feathers on the head is by no\r\nmeans a rare occurrence; namely, in the True-tufted breed, the\r\nHook-billed, the common farm-yard kind, and in a duck having no other\r\npeculiarity which was sent to me from the Malayan archipelago. The tuft\r\nis only so far interesting as it affects the skull, which is thus\r\nrendered slightly more globular, and is perforated by numerous\r\napertures. Call ducks are remarkable from their extraordinary\r\nloquacity: the drake only hisses like common drakes; nevertheless, when\r\npaired with the common duck, he transmits to his female offspring a\r\nstrong quacking tendency. This loquacity seems at first a surprising\r\ncharacter to have been acquired under domestication. But the voice\r\nvaries in the different breeds; Mr. Brent[15] says that Hook-billed\r\nducks are very loquacious, and that Rouens utter a “dull, loud, and\r\nmonotonous cry, easily distinguishable by an experienced ear.” As the\r\nloquacity of the Call duck is highly serviceable, these birds being\r\nused in decoys, this quality may have been increased by selection. For\r\ninstance, Colonel Hawker says, if young wild ducks cannot be got for a\r\ndecoy, “by way of make-shift, _select_ tame birds which are the most\r\nclamorous, even if their colour should not be like that of wild\r\nones.”[16] It has been erroneously asserted that Call ducks hatch their\r\neggs in less time than common ducks.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Penguin duck is the most remarkable of all the breeds; the thin\r\nneck and body are carried erect; the wings are small; the tail is\r\nupturned; and the thigh-bones and metatarsi are considerably lengthened\r\nin proportion with the same bones in the wild duck. In five specimens\r\nexamined by me there were only eighteen tail-feathers instead of twenty\r\nas in the wild duck; but I have also found only eighteen and nineteen\r\ntail-feathers in two Labrador ducks. On the middle toe, in three\r\nspecimens, there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight scutellæ, whereas in\r\ntwo wild ducks there were thirty-one and thirty-two. The Penguin when\r\ncrossed transmits with much power its peculiar form of body and gait to\r\nits offspring; this was manifest with some hybrids raised in the\r\nZoological Gardens between one of these birds and the Egyptian\r\ngoose,[18] (_Anser ægyptiacus_) and likewise with some mongrels which I\r\nraised between the Penguin and Labrador duck. I am not much surprised\r\nthat some writers should maintain that this breed must be descended\r\nfrom an unknown and distinct species; but from the reasons already\r\nassigned, it seems to me far more probable that it is the descendant,\r\nmuch modified by domestication under an unnatural climate, of _Anas\r\nboschas._\r\n\r\n_Osteological Characters._—The skulls of the several breeds differ from\r\neach other and from the skull of the wild duck in very little except in\r\nthe proportional length and curvature of the premaxillaries. These\r\nlatter bones in the Call duck are short, and a line drawn from their\r\nextremities to the summit of the skull is nearly straight, instead of\r\nbeing concave as in the common duck; so that the skull resembles that\r\nof a small goose. In the Hook-billed duck (fig. 39), these same bones\r\nas well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most remarkable manner,\r\nas represented. In the Labrador duck the premaxillaries are rather\r\nbroader than in the wild duck; and in two skulls of this breed the\r\nvertical ridges on each side of the supra-occipital bone are very\r\nprominent. In the Penguin the premaxillaries are relatively shorter\r\nthan in the wild duck; and the inferior points of the paramastoids more\r\nprominent. In a Dutch tufted duck, the skull under the enormous tuft\r\nwas slightly more globular and was perforated by two large apertures;\r\nin this skull the lachrymal bones were produced much further backwards,\r\nso as to have a different shape and nearly to touch the post. lat.\r\nprocesses of the frontal bones, thus almost completing the bony orbit\r\nof the eye. As the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex\r\nshape and stand in relation with so many other bones, I carefully\r\ncompared them in all the principal breeds; but excepting in size they\r\npresented no difference.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig 40—Cervical Verterbræ of Ducks.\r\n\r\n_Vertebræ and Ribs._—In one skeleton of the Labrador duck there were\r\nthe usual fifteen cervical vertebræ and the usual nine dorsal vertebræ\r\nbearing ribs; in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten\r\ndorsal vertebræ with ribs; nor, as far as could be judged, was this\r\nowing merely to a rib having been developed on the first lumbar\r\nvertebra; for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebræ agreed perfectly in\r\nnumber, shape, and size with those of the wild duck. In two skeletons\r\nof the Call duck there were fifteen cervical and nine dorsal vertebræ;\r\nin a third skeleton small ribs were attached to the so-called fifteenth\r\ncervical vertebra, making ten pairs of ribs; but these ten ribs do not\r\ncorrespond, or arise from the same vertebra, with the ten in the\r\nabove-mentioned Labrador duck. In the Call duck, which had small ribs\r\nattached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra, the hæmal spines of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth (cervical) and of the seventeenth (dorsal)\r\nvertebræ corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\neighteenth vertebræ of the wild duck: so that each of these vertebræ\r\nhad acquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position. In\r\nthe eighth cervical vertebra of this same Call duck (fig. 40, B), the\r\ntwo branches of the hæmal spine stand much closer together than in the\r\nwild duck (A), and the descending hæmal processes are much shortened.\r\nIn the Penguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely\r\nappears (as ascertained by measurement) to be much elongated, but the\r\ncervical and dorsal vertebræ present no difference; the posterior\r\ndorsal vertebræ, however, are more completely anchylosed to the pelvis\r\nthan in the wild duck. The Aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten\r\ndorsal vertebræ furnished with ribs, but the same number of lumbar,\r\nsacral, and caudal vertebræ, as far as could be traced, as in the wild\r\nduck. The cervical vertebræ in this same duck (fig. 40, D) were much\r\nbroader and thicker relatively to their length than in the wild (C); so\r\nmuch so, that I have thought it worth while to give a sketch of the\r\ntwelfth cervical vertebra in these two birds. From the foregoing\r\nstatements we see that the fifteenth cervical vertebra occasionally\r\nbecomes modified into a dorsal vertebra, and when this occurs all the\r\nadjoining vertebræ are modified. We also see that an additional dorsal\r\nvertebra bearing a rib is occasionally developed, the number of the\r\ncervical and lumbar vertebræ apparently remaining the same as usual.\r\n\r\nI examined the bony enlargement of the trachea in the males of the\r\nPenguin, Call, Hook-billed, Labrador, and Aylesbury breeds; and in all\r\nit was identical in shape.\r\n\r\nThe _pelvis_ is remarkably uniform; but in the skeleton of the\r\nHook-billed duck the anterior part is much bowed inwards; in the\r\nAylesbury and some other breeds the ischiadic foramen is less\r\nelongated. In the sternum, furculum, coracoids, and scapulæ, the\r\ndifferences are so slight and so variable as not to be worth notice,\r\nexcept that in two skeletons of the Penguin duck the terminal portion\r\nof the scapula was much attenuated.\r\n\r\nIn the bones of the leg and wing no modification in shape could be\r\nobserved. But in the Penguin and Hook-billed ducks, the terminal\r\nphalanges of the wing are a little shortened. In the former, the femur,\r\nand metatarsus (but not the tibia) are considerably lengthened,\r\nrelatively to the same bones in the wild duck, and to the wing-bones in\r\nboth birds. This elongation of the leg-bones could be seen whilst the\r\nbird was alive, and is no doubt connected with its peculiar upright\r\nmanner of walking. In a large Aylesbury duck, on the other hand, the\r\ntibia was the only bone of the leg which relatively to the other bones\r\nwas slightly lengthened.\r\n\r\n_On the effects of the increased and decreased Use of the Limbs._—In\r\nall the breeds the bones of the wing (measured separately after having\r\nbeen cleaned) relatively to those of the leg have become slightly\r\nshortened, in comparison with the same bones in the wild duck, as may\r\nbe seen in Table I.\r\n\r\nTable I\r\n\r\nName of Breed     Length of Femur,\r\n          Tibia, and Meta-\r\n          tarsus together     Length of Humerus,\r\n          Radius, and Meta-\r\n          carpus together     Or as Inches     Inches Wild\r\n          mallard     7·14       9·28     100 : 129\r\n          Aylesbury     8·64     10·43     100 : 120 Tufted\r\n          (Dutch)     8·25       9·83     100 : 119 Penguin     7·12      \r\n          8·78     100 : 123 Call     6·20       7·77     100 : 125 Length\r\n          of same\r\n          Bones     Length of all the\r\n          Bones of Wing Inches     Inches Wild duck (another\r\n          specimen)     6·85     10·07     100 : 147 Common domestic\r\n          duck     8·15     11·26     100 : 138\r\n\r\nIn Table I we see, by comparison with the wild duck, that the reduction\r\nin the length of the bones of the wing, relatively to those of the\r\nlegs, though slight, is universal. The reduction is least in the Call\r\nduck, which has the power and the habit of frequently flying.\r\n\r\nIn weight there is a greater relative difference between the bones of\r\nthe leg and wing, as may be seen in Table II:—\r\n\r\nTable II\r\n\r\nName of Breed     Weight of Femur,\r\n          Tibia, and\r\n          Metatarsus     Weight of\r\n          Humerus, Radius,\r\n          and Metacarpus     Or as Grains     Grains Wild mallard      \r\n          54       97     100 : 179 Aylesbury     164     204     100 : 124\r\n          Hooked-bill     107     160     100 : 149 Tufted\r\n          (Dutch)     111     148     100 : 133 Penguin       75\r\n          90.5     100 : 120 Labrador     141     165     100 : 117\r\n          Call       57       93     100 : 163 Weight of all the\r\n          Bones of the\r\n          Leg and Foot     Weight of all the\r\n          Bones of the\r\n          Wing Grains     Grains Wild (another specimen)      \r\n          66     115     100 : 173 Common domestic\r\n          duck     127     158     100 : 124\r\n\r\nIn these domesticated birds, the considerably lessened weight of the\r\nbones of the wing (_i.e._ on an average, twenty-five per cent of their\r\nproper proportional weight), as well as their slightly lessened length,\r\nrelatively to the leg-bones, might follow, not from any actual decrease\r\nin the wing-bones, but from the increased weight and length of the\r\nbones of the legs. Table IIIa shows that the leg-bones relatively to\r\nthe weight of the entire skeleton have really increased in weight; but\r\nTable IIIb shows that according to the same standard the wing-bones\r\nhave also really decreased in weight; so that the relative\r\ndisproportion shown in the foregoing tables between the wing and\r\nleg-bones, in comparison with those of the wild duck, is partly due to\r\nthe increase in weight and length of the leg-bones, and partly to the\r\ndecrease in weight and length of the wing-bones.\r\n\r\nTable III\r\n\r\nName of Breed     Weight of entire\r\n          Skeleton.\r\n          (N.B.

In the first of these\r\ntables we see that the leg-bones in each case have increased in actual\r\nweight. It might have been expected that, with the increased or\r\ndecreased weight of the entire skeleton, the leg-bones would have\r\nbecome proportionally heavier or lighter; but their greater weight in\r\nall the breeds relatively to the other bones can be accounted for only\r\nby these domestic birds having used their legs in walking and standing\r\nmuch more than the wild, for they never fly, and the more artificial\r\nbreeds rarely swim. In the second table we see, with the exception of\r\none case, a plain reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing, and\r\nthis no doubt has resulted from their lessened use. The one exceptional\r\ncase, namely, in one of the Call ducks, is in truth no exception, for\r\nthis bird was constantly in the habit of flying about; and I have seen\r\nit day after day rise from my grounds, and fly for a long time in\r\ncircles of more than a mile in diameter. In this Call duck there is not\r\nonly no decrease, but an actual increase in the weight of the\r\nwing-bones relatively to those of the wild-duck; and this probably is\r\nconsequent on the remarkable lightness and thinness of all the bones of\r\nthe skeleton.\r\n\r\nLastly, I weighed the furculum, coracoids, and scapula of a wild duck\r\nand of a common domestic duck, and I found that their weight,\r\nrelatively to that of the whole skeleton, was as one hundred in the\r\nformer to eighty-nine in the latter; this shows that these bones in the\r\ndomestic duck have been reduced eleven per cent of their due\r\nproportional weight. The prominence of the crest of the sternum,\r\nrelatively to its length, is also much reduced in all the domestic\r\nbreeds. These changes have evidently been caused by the lessened use of\r\nthe wings.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that several birds, belonging to different Orders, and\r\ninhabiting oceanic islands, have their wings greatly reduced in size\r\nand are incapable of flight. I suggested in my ‘Origin of Species’\r\nthat, as these birds are not persecuted by any enemies, the reduction\r\nof their wings had probably been caused by gradual disuse. Hence,\r\nduring the earlier stages of the process of reduction, such birds would\r\nprobably have resembled our domesticated ducks in the state of their\r\norgans of flight. This is the case with the water-hen (_Gallinula\r\nnesiotis_) of Tristan d’Acunha, which “can flutter a little, but\r\nobviously uses its legs, and not its wings, as a mode of escape.” Now\r\nMr. Sclater[19] finds in this bird that the wings, sternum, and\r\ncoracoids are all reduced in length, and the crest of the sternum in\r\ndepth, in comparison with the same bones in the European water-hen (_G.\r\nchloropus_). On the other hand, the thigh-bones and pelvis are\r\nincreased in length, the former by four lines, relatively to the same\r\nbones in the common water-hen. Hence in the skeleton of this natural\r\nspecies nearly the same changes have occurred, only carried a little\r\nfurther, as with our domestic ducks, and in this latter case I presume\r\nno one will dispute that they have resulted from the lessened use of\r\nthe wings and the increased use of the legs.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis bird deserves some notice, as hardly any other anciently\r\ndomesticated bird or quadruped has varied so little. That geese were\r\nanciently domesticated we know from certain verses in Homer; and from\r\nthese birds having been kept (388 B.C.) in the Capitol at Rome as\r\nsacred to Juno, which sacredness implies great antiquity.[20] That the\r\ngoose has varied in some degree, we may infer from naturalists not\r\nbeing unanimous with respect to its wild parent-form; though the\r\ndifficulty is chiefly due to the existence of three or four closely\r\nallied wild European species.[21] A large majority of capable judges\r\nare convinced that our geese are descended from the wild Grey-leg goose\r\n(_A. ferus_); the young of which can easily be tamed.[22] This species,\r\nwhen crossed with the domestic goose, produced in the Zoological\r\nGardens, as I was assured in 1849, perfectly fertile offspring.[23]\r\nYarrell[24] has observed that the lower part of the trachea of the\r\ndomestic goose is sometimes flattened, and that a ring of white\r\nfeathers sometimes surrounds the base of the beak. These characters\r\nseem at first sight good indications of a cross at some former period\r\nwith the white-fronted goose (_A. albifrons_); but the white ring is\r\nvariable in this latter species, and we must not overlook the law of\r\nanalogous variation; that is, of one species assuming some of the\r\ncharacters of allied species.\r\n\r\nAs the goose has proved so little flexible in its organisation under\r\nlong-continued domestication, the amount of variation which it has\r\nundergone may be worth giving. It has increased in size and in\r\nproductiveness;[25] and varies from white to a dusky colour. Several\r\nobservers[26] have stated that the gander is more frequently white than\r\nthe goose, and that when old it almost invariably becomes white; but\r\nthis is not the case with the parent-form, the _A. ferus._ Here, again,\r\nthe law of analogous variation may have come into play, as the almost\r\nsnow-white male of the Rock goose (_Bernicla antarctica_) standing on\r\nthe sea-shore by his dusky partner is a sight well known to those who\r\nhave traversed the sounds of Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands.\r\nSome geese have top-knots; and the skull beneath, as before stated, is\r\nperforated. A sub-breed has lately been formed with the feathers\r\nreversed at the back of the head and neck.[27] The beak varies a little\r\nin size, and is of a yellower tint than in the wild species; but its\r\ncolour and that of the legs are both slightly variable.[28] This latter\r\nfact deserves attention, because the colour of the legs and beak is\r\nhighly serviceable in discriminating the several closely allied wild\r\nforms.[29] At our Shows two breeds are exhibited; viz., the Embden and\r\nToulouse; but they differ in nothing except colour.[30] Recently a\r\nsmaller and singular variety has been imported from Sebastopol,[31]\r\nwith the scapular feathers (as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, who sent me\r\nspecimens) greatly elongated, curled, and even spirally twisted. The\r\nmargins of these feathers are rendered plumose by the divergence of the\r\nbarbs and barbules, so that they resemble in some degree those on the\r\nback of the black Australian swan. These feathers are likewise\r\nremarkable from the central shaft, which is excessively thin and\r\ntransparent, being split into fine filaments, which, after running for\r\na space free, sometimes coalesce again. It is a curious fact that these\r\nfilaments are regularly clothed on each side with fine down or\r\nbarbules, precisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather. This\r\nstructure of the feathers is transmitted to half-bred birds. In _\r\nGallus sonneratii_ the barbs and barbules blend together, and form thin\r\nhorny plates of the same nature with the shaft: in this variety of the\r\ngoose, the shaft divides into filaments which acquire barbules, and\r\nthus resemble true barbs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the domestic goose certainly differs somewhat from any known\r\nwild species, yet the amount of variation which it has undergone, as\r\ncompared with that of most domesticated animals, is singularly small.\r\nThis fact can be partially accounted for by selection not having come\r\nlargely into play. Birds of all kinds which present many distinct races\r\nare valued as pets or ornaments; no one makes a pet of the goose; the\r\nname, indeed, in more languages than one, is a term of reproach. The\r\ngoose is valued for its size and flavour, for the whiteness of its\r\nfeathers which adds to their value, and for its prolificness and\r\ntameness. In all these points the goose differs from the wild\r\nparent-form; and these are the points which have been selected. Even in\r\nancient times the Roman gourmands valued the liver of the _white_\r\ngoose; and Pierre Belon[32] in 1555 speaks of two varieties, one of\r\nwhich was larger, more fecund, and of a better colour than the other;\r\nand he expressly states that good managers attended to the colour of\r\ntheir goslings, so that they might know which to preserve and select\r\nfor breeding.\r\n\r\nTHE PEACOCK.\r\n\r\nThis is another bird which has hardly varied under domestication,\r\nexcept in sometimes being white or piebald. Mr. Waterhouse carefully\r\ncompared, as he informs me, skins of the wild Indian and domestic bird,\r\nand they were identical in every respect, except that the plumage of\r\nthe latter was perhaps rather thicker. Whether our birds are descended\r\nfrom those introduced into Europe in the time of Alexander, or have\r\nbeen subsequently imported, is doubtful. They do not breed very freely\r\nwith us, and are seldom kept in large numbers,—circumstances which\r\nwould greatly interfere with the gradual selection and formation of new\r\nbreeds. There is one strange fact with respect to the peacock, namely,\r\nthe occasional appearance in England of the “japanned” or\r\n“black-shouldered” kind. This form has lately been named on the high\r\nauthority of Mr. Sclater as a distinct species, viz. _Pavo\r\nnigripennis,_ which he believes will hereafter be found wild in some\r\ncountry, but not in India, where it is certainly unknown. The males of\r\nthese japanned birds differ conspicuously from the common peacock in\r\nthe colour of their secondary wing-feathers, scapulars, wing-coverts,\r\nand thighs, and are I think more beautiful; they are rather smaller\r\nthan the common sort, and are always beaten by them in their battles,\r\nas I hear from the Hon. A. S. G. Canning. The females are much paler\r\ncoloured than those of the common kind. Both sexes, as Mr. Canning\r\ninforms me, are white when they leave the egg, and they differ from the\r\nyoung of the white variety only in having a peculiar pinkish tinge on\r\ntheir wings. These japanned birds, though appearing suddenly in flocks\r\nof the common kind, propagate their kind quite truly. Although they do\r\nnot resemble the hybrids which have been raised between _P. cristatus_\r\nand _ muticus,_ nevertheless they are in some respects intermediate in\r\ncharacter between these two species; and this fact favours, as Mr.\r\nSclater believes, the view that they form a distinct and natural\r\nspecies.[33]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Sir H. Heron states[34] that this breed suddenly\r\nappeared within his memory in Lord Brownlow’s large stock of pied,\r\nwhite, and common peacocks. The same thing occurred in Sir J.\r\nTrevelyan’s flock composed entirely of the common kind, and in Mr.\r\nThornton’s stock of common and pied peacocks. It is remarkable that in\r\nthese two latter instances the black-shouldered kind, though a smaller\r\nand weaker bird, increased, “to the extinction of the previously\r\nexisting breed.” I have also received through Mr. Sclater a statement\r\nfrom Mr. Hudson Gurney that he reared many years ago a pair of\r\nblack-shouldered peacocks from the common kind; and another\r\nornithologist, Prof. A. Newton, states that, five or six years ago, a\r\nfemale bird, in all respects similar to the female of the\r\nblack-shouldered kind, was produced from a stock of common peacocks in\r\nhis possession, which during more than twenty years had not been\r\ncrossed with birds of any other strain. Mr. Jenner Weir informs me that\r\na peacock at Blackheath whilst young was white, but as it became older\r\ngradually assumed the characters of the black-shouldered variety; both\r\nits parents were common peacocks. Lastly, Mr. Canning has given a case\r\nof a female of this same variety appearing in Ireland in a flock of the\r\nordinary kind.[35] Here, then, we have seven well authenticated cases\r\nin Great Britain of japanned birds, having suddenly appeared within\r\nrecent times in flocks of the common peafowl. This variety must also\r\nhave formerly appeared in Europe, for Mr. Canning has seen an old\r\npicture, and another is referred to in the ‘Field,’ with this variety\r\nrepresented. These facts seem to me to indicate that the japanned\r\npeacock is a strongly marked variety or “sport,” which tends at all\r\ntimes and in many places to reappear. This view is supported by the\r\nyoung being at first white like the young of the white breed, which is\r\nundoubtedly a variation. If, on the other hand, we believe the japanned\r\npeacock to be a distinct species, we must suppose that in all the above\r\ncases the common breed had at some former period been crossed by it,\r\nbut had lost every trace of the cross; yet that the offspring of these\r\nbirds suddenly and completely reacquired through reversion the\r\ncharacters of _P. nigripennis._ I have heard of no other such case in\r\nthe animal or vegetable kingdom. To perceive the full improbability of\r\nsuch an occurrence, we may suppose that a breed of dogs had been\r\ncrossed at some former period with a wolf, but had lost every trace of\r\nthe wolf-like character, yet that the breed gave birth in seven\r\ninstances in the same country, within no great length of time, to a\r\nwolf perfect in every character; and we must further suppose that in\r\ntwo of the cases, the newly produced wolves afterwards spontaneously\r\nincreased to such an extent as to lead to the extinction of the parent\r\nbreed of dogs. So remarkable a bird as the _P. nigripennis,_ when first\r\nimported, would have realised a large price; it is therefore improbable\r\nthat it should have been silently introduced and its history\r\nsubsequently lost. On the whole the evidence seems to me, as it did to\r\nSir R. Heron, to be decisive in favour of the japanned or\r\nblack-shouldered breed being a variation, induced by some unknown\r\ncause. On this view, the case is the most remarkable one ever recorded\r\nof the abrupt appearance of a new form, which so closely resembles a\r\ntrue species that it has deceived one of the most experienced of living\r\nornithologists.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKEY.\r\n\r\nIt seems fairly well established by Mr. Gould,[36] that the turkey, in\r\naccordance with the history of its first introduction, is descended\r\nfrom a wild Mexican form, which had been domesticated by the natives\r\nbefore the discovery of America, and which is now generally ranked as a\r\nlocal race, and not as a distinct species. However this may be, the\r\ncase deserves notice because in the United States wild male turkeys\r\nsometimes court the domestic hens, which are descended from the Mexican\r\nform, “and are generally received by them with great pleasure.”[37]\r\nSeveral accounts have likewise been published of young birds, reared in\r\nthe United States from the eggs of the wild species, crossing and\r\ncommingling with the common breed. In England, also, this same species\r\nhas been kept in several parks; from two of which the Rev. W. D. Fox\r\nprocured birds, and they crossed freely with the common domestic kind,\r\nand during many years afterwards, as he informs me, the turkeys in his\r\nneighbourhood clearly showed traces of their crossed parentage. We here\r\nhave an instance of a domestic race being modified by a cross with a\r\ndistinct wild race or species. F. Michaux[38] suspected in 1802 that\r\nthe common domestic turkey was not descended from the United States\r\nspecies alone, but likewise from a southern form, and he went so far as\r\nto believe that English and French turkeys differed from having\r\ndifferent proportions of the blood of the two parent-forms.\r\n\r\nEnglish turkeys are smaller than either wild form. They have not varied\r\nin any great degree; but there are some breeds which can be\r\ndistinguished as Norfolks, Suffolks, Whites, and Copper-coloured (or\r\nCambridge), all of which, if precluded from crossing with other breeds\r\npropagate their kind truly. Of these kinds, the most distinct is the\r\nsmall, hardy, dull-black Norfolk turkey, of which the chickens are\r\nblack, occasionally with white patches about the head. The other breeds\r\nscarcely differ except in colour, and their chickens are generally\r\nmottled all over with brownish-grey.[39] The inferior tail-coverts vary\r\nin number, and according to a German superstition the hen lays as many\r\neggs as the cock has feathers of this kind.[40] Albin in 1738, and\r\nTemminck within a much later period, describe a beautiful breed,\r\ndusky-yellowish, brown above and white beneath, with a large top-knot\r\nof soft plumose feather. The spurs of the male were rudimentary. This\r\nbreed has been for a long time extinct in Europe; but a living specimen\r\nhas lately been imported from the east coast of Africa, which still\r\nretains the top-knot and the same general colouring and rudimentary\r\nspurs.[41] Mr. Wilmot has described[42] a white turkey-cock having a\r\ncrest formed of “feathers about four inches long, with bare quills, and\r\na tuft of soft white down growing at the end.” Many of the young birds\r\ninherited this kind of crest, but afterwards it fell off or was pecked\r\nout by the other birds. This is an interesting case, as with care a new\r\nbreed might probably have been formed; and a top-knot of this nature\r\nwould have been to a certain extent analogous to that borne by the\r\nmales in several allied genera, such as Euplocomus, Lophophorus, and\r\nPavo.\r\n\r\nWild turkeys, believed in every instance to have been imported from the\r\nUnited States, have been kept in the parks of Lords Powis, Leicester,\r\nHill, and Derby. The Rev. W. D. Fox procured birds from the two\r\nfirst-named parks, and he informs me that they certainly differed a\r\nlittle from each other in the shape of their bodies and in the barred\r\nplumage on their wings. These birds likewise differed from Lord Hill’s\r\nstock. Some of the latter kept at Oulton by Sir P. Egerton, though\r\nprecluded from crossing with common turkeys, occasionally produced much\r\npaler-coloured birds, and one that was almost white, but not an albino.\r\nThese half-wild turkeys, in thus differing slightly from each other,\r\npresent an analogous case with the wild cattle kept in the several\r\nBritish parks. We must suppose that such differences have resulted from\r\nthe prevention of free intercrossing between birds ranging over a wide\r\narea, and from the changed conditions to which they have been exposed\r\nin England. In India the climate has apparently wrought a still greater\r\nchange in the turkey, for it is described by Mr. Blyth[43] as being\r\nmuch degenerated in size, “utterly incapable of rising on the wing,” of\r\na black colour, and “with the long pendulous appendages over the beak\r\nenormously developed.”\r\n\r\nTHE GUINEA FOWL.\r\n\r\nThe domesticated Guinea fowl is now believed by some naturalists to be\r\ndescended from the _Numida ptilorhynca,_ which inhabits very hot, and,\r\nin parts, extremely arid districts in Eastern Africa; consequently it\r\nhas been exposed in this country to extremely different conditions of\r\nlife. Nevertheless it has hardly varied at all, except in the plumage\r\nbeing either paler or darker-coloured. It is a singular fact that this\r\nbird varies more in colour in the West Indies and on the Spanish Main,\r\nunder a hot though humid climate, than in Europe.[44] The Guinea fowl\r\nhas become thoroughly feral in Jamaica and in St. Domingo,[45] and has\r\ndiminished in size; the legs are black, whereas the legs of the\r\naboriginal African bird are said to be grey. This small change is worth\r\nnotice on account of the often-repeated statement that all feral\r\nanimals invariably revert in every character to their original type.\r\n\r\nTHE CANARY BIRD.\r\n\r\nAs this bird has been recently domesticated, namely, within the last\r\n350 years, its variability deserves notice. It has been crossed with\r\nnine or ten other species of Fringillidæ, and some of the hybrids are\r\nalmost completely fertile; but we have no evidence that any distinct\r\nbreed has originated from such crosses. Notwithstanding the modern\r\ndomestication of the canary, many varieties have been produced; even\r\nbefore the year 1718 a list of twenty-seven varieties was published in\r\nFrance,[46] and in 1779 a long schedule of the desired qualities was\r\nprinted by the London Canary Society, so that methodical selection has\r\nbeen practised during a considerable period. The greater number of the\r\nvarieties differ only in colour and in the markings of their plumage.\r\nSome breeds however, differ in shape, such as the hooped or bowed\r\ncanaries, and the Belgian canaries with their much elongated bodies.\r\nMr. Brent[47] measured one of the latter and found it eight inches in\r\nlength, whilst the wild canary is only five and a quarter inches long.\r\nThere are top-knotted canaries, and it is a singular fact that, if two\r\ntop-knotted birds are matched, the young, instead of having very fine\r\ntop-knots, are generally bald, or even have a wound on their heads.[48]\r\nIt would appear as if the top-knot were due to some morbid condition,\r\nwhich is increased to an injurious degree when two birds in this state\r\nare paired. There is a feather-footed breed, and another with a kind of\r\nfrill running down the breast. One other character deserves notice from\r\nbeing confined to one period of life, and from being strictly inherited\r\nat the same period; namely, the wing and tail feathers in prize\r\ncanaries being black, “but this colour is retained only until the first\r\nmoult; once moulted, the peculiarity ceases.”[49] Canaries differ much\r\nin disposition and character, and in some small degree in song. They\r\nproduce eggs three or four times during the year.\r\n\r\nGOLD-FISH.\r\n\r\nBesides mammals and birds, only a few animals belonging to the other\r\ngreat classes have been domesticated; but to show that it is an almost\r\nuniversal law that animals, when removed from their natural conditions\r\nof life, vary, and that races can be formed when selection is applied,\r\nit is necessary to say a few words on gold-fish, bees, and silk-moths.\r\n\r\nGold-fish (_Cyprinus auratus_) were introduced into Europe only two or\r\nthree centuries ago; but they have been kept in confinement from an\r\nancient period in China. Mr. Blyth[50] suspects, from the analogous\r\nvariation of other fishes, that golden-coloured fish do not occur in a\r\nstate of nature. These fishes frequently live under the most unnatural\r\nconditions, and their variability in colour, size, and in some\r\nimportant points of structure is very great. M. Sauvigny has described\r\nand given coloured drawings of no less than eighty-nine varieties.[51]\r\nMany of the varieties, however, such as triple tail-fins, etc., ought\r\nto be called monstrosities; but it is difficult to draw any distinct\r\nline between a variation and a monstrosity. As gold-fish are kept for\r\nornament or curiosity, and as “the Chinese are just the people to have\r\nsecluded a chance variety of any kind, and to have matched and paired\r\nfrom it,”[52] it might have been predicted that selection would have\r\nbeen largely practised in the formation of new breeds; and this is the\r\ncase. In an old Chinese work it is said that fish with vermilion scales\r\nwere first raised in confinement during the Sung dynasty (which\r\ncommenced A.D. 960), “and now they are cultivated in families\r\neverywhere for the sake of ornament.” In another and more ancient work,\r\nit is said that “there is not a household where the gold-fish is not\r\ncultivated, in _rivalry_ as to its colour, and as a source of profit,”\r\netc.[53] Although many breeds exist, it is a singular fact that the\r\nvariations are often not inherited. Sir R. Heron[54] kept many of these\r\nfishes, and placed all the deformed ones, namely, those destitute of\r\ndorsal fins and those furnished with a double anal fin, or triple tail,\r\nin a pond by themselves; but they did “not produce a greater proportion\r\nof deformed offspring than the perfect fishes.”\r\n\r\nPassing over an almost infinite diversity of colour, we meet with the\r\nmost extraordinary modifications of structure. Thus, out of about two\r\ndozen specimens bought in London, Mr. Yarrell observed some with the\r\ndorsal fin extending along more than half the length of the back:\r\nothers with this fin reduced to only five or six rays: and one with no\r\ndorsal fin. The anal fins are sometimes double, and the tail is often\r\ntriple. This latter deviation of structure seems generally to occur “at\r\nthe expense of the whole or part of some other fin;”[55] but Bory de\r\nSaint-Vincent[56] saw at Madrid gold-fish furnished with a dorsal fin\r\nand a triple tail. One variety is characterised by a hump on its back\r\nnear the head; and the Rev. L. Jenyns[57] has described a most singular\r\nvariety, imported from China, almost globular in form like a Diodon,\r\nwith “the fleshy part of the tail as if entirely cut away? the caudal\r\nfin being set on a little behind the dorsal and immediately above the\r\nanal.” In this fish the anal and caudal fins were double; the anal fin\r\nbeing attached to the body in a vertical line: the eyes also were\r\nenormously large and protuberant.\r\n\r\nHIVE-BEES.\r\n\r\nBees have been domesticated from an ancient period; if indeed their\r\nstate can be considered one of domestication, for they search for their\r\nown food, with the exception of a little generally given to them during\r\nthe winter. Their habitation is a hive instead of a hole in a tree.\r\nBees, however, have been transported into almost every quarter of the\r\nworld, so that climate ought to have produced whatever direct effect it\r\nis capable of producing. It is frequently asserted that the bees in\r\ndifferent parts of Great Britain differ in size, colour, and temper;\r\nand Godron[58] says that they are generally larger in the south than in\r\nother parts of France; it has also been asserted that the little brown\r\nbees of High Burgundy, when transported to La Bresse become large and\r\nyellow in the second generation. But these statements require\r\nconfirmation. As far as size is concerned, it is known that bees\r\nproduced in very old combs are smaller, owing to the cells having\r\nbecome smaller from the successive old cocoons. The best\r\nauthorities[59] concur that, with the exception of the Ligurian race or\r\nspecies, presently to be mentioned, distinct breeds do not exist in\r\nBritain or on the Continent. There is, however, even in the same stock,\r\nsome variability in colour. Thus, Mr. Woodbury states,[60] that he has\r\nseveral times seen queen bees of the common kind annulated with\r\nyellow-like Ligurian queens, and the latter dark-coloured like common\r\nbees. He has also observed variations in the colour of the drones,\r\nwithout any corresponding difference in the queens or workers of the\r\nsame hive. The great apiarian, Dzierzon, in answer to my queries on\r\nthis subject, says,[61] that in Germany bees of some stocks are\r\ndecidedly dark, whilst others are remarkable for their yellow colour.\r\nBees also seem to differ in habits in different districts, for Dzierzon\r\nadds, “If many stocks with their offspring are more inclined to swarm,\r\nwhilst others are richer in honey, so that some bee-keepers even\r\ndistinguish between swarming and honey-gathering bees, this is a habit\r\nwhich has become second nature, caused by the customary mode of keeping\r\nthe bees and the pasturage of the district. For example, what a\r\ndifference in this respect one may perceive to exist between the bees\r\nof the Luneburg heath and those of this country!” . . . “Removing an\r\nold queen and substituting a young one of the current year is here an\r\ninfallible mode of keeping the strongest stock from swarming and\r\npreventing drone-breeding; whilst the same means if adopted in Hanover\r\nwould certainly be of no avail.” I procured a hive full of dead bees\r\nfrom Jamaica, where they have long been naturalised, and, on carefully\r\ncomparing them under the microscope with my own bees, I could detect\r\nnot a trace of difference.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable uniformity in the hive-bee, wherever kept, may probably\r\nbe accounted for by the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of\r\nbringing selection into play by pairing particular queens and drones,\r\nfor these insects unite only during flight. Nor is there any record,\r\nwith a single partial exception, of any person having separated and\r\nbred from a hive in which the workers presented some appreciable\r\ndifference. In order to form a new breed, seclusion from other bees\r\nwould, as we now know, be indispensable; for since the introduction of\r\nthe Ligurian bee into Germany and England, it has been found that the\r\ndrones wander at least two miles from their own hives, and often cross\r\nwith the queens of the common bee.[62] The Ligurian bee, although\r\nperfectly fertile when crossed with the common kind, is ranked by most\r\nnaturalists as a distinct species, whilst by others it is ranked as a\r\nvariety: but this form need not here be noticed, as there is no reason\r\nto believe that it is the product of domestication. The Egyptian and\r\nsome other bees are likewise ranked by Dr. Gerstäcker,[63] but not by\r\nother highly competent judges, as geographical races; he grounds his\r\nconclusion in chief part on the fact that in certain districts, as in\r\nthe Crimea and Rhodes, they vary so much in colour, that the several\r\ngeographical races can be closely connected by intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to a single instance of the separation and preservation\r\nof a particular stock of bees. Mr. Lowe[64] procured some bees from a\r\ncottager a few miles from Edinburgh, and perceived that they differed\r\nfrom the common bee in the hairs on the head and thorax being lighter\r\ncoloured and more profuse in quantity. From the date of the\r\nintroduction of the Ligurian bee into Great Britain we may feel sure\r\nthat these bees had not been crossed with this form. Mr. Lowe\r\npropagated this variety, but unfortunately did not separate the stock\r\nfrom his other bees, and after three generations the new character was\r\nalmost completely lost. Nevertheless, as he adds, “a great number of\r\nthe bees still retain traces, though faint, of the original colony.”\r\nThis case shows us what could probably be effected by careful and\r\nlong-continued selection applied exclusively to the workers, for, as we\r\nhave seen, queens and drones cannot be selected and paired.\r\n\r\nSILK-MOTHS.\r\n\r\nThese insects are in several respects interesting to us, more\r\nespecially because they have varied largely at an early period of life,\r\nand the variations have been inherited at corresponding periods. As the\r\nvalue of the silk-moth depends entirely on the cocoon, every change in\r\nits structure and qualities has been carefully attended to, and races\r\ndiffering much in the cocoon, but hardly at all in the adult state,\r\nhave been produced. With the races of most other domestic animals, the\r\nyoung resemble each other closely, whilst the adults differ much.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless, even if it were possible, to describe all the many\r\nkinds of silkworms. Several distinct species exist in India and China\r\nwhich produce useful silk, and some of these are capable of freely\r\ncrossing with the common silk-moth, as has been recently ascertained in\r\nFrance. Captain Hutton[65] states that throughout the world at least\r\nsix species have been domesticated; and he believes that the silk-moths\r\nreared in Europe belong to two or three species. This, however, is not\r\nthe opinion of several capable judges who have particularly attended to\r\nthe cultivation of this insect in France; and hardly accords with some\r\nfacts presently to be given.\r\n\r\nThe common silk-moth (_Bombyx mori_) was brought to Constantinople in\r\nthe sixth century, whence it was carried into Italy, and in 1494 into\r\nFrance.[66] Everything has been favourable for the variation of this\r\ninsect. It is believed to have been domesticated in China as long ago\r\nas 2700 B.C. It has been kept under unnatural and diversified\r\nconditions of life, and has been transported into many countries. There\r\nis reason to believe that the nature of the food given to the\r\ncaterpillar influences to a certain extent the character of the\r\nbreed.[67] Disuse has apparently aided in checking the development of\r\nthe wings. But the most important element in the production of the many\r\nnow existing, much modified races, no doubt has been the close\r\nattention which has long been applied in many countries to every\r\npromising variation. The care taken in Europe in the selection of the\r\nbest cocoons and moths for breeding is notorious,[68] and the\r\nproduction of eggs is followed as a distinct trade in parts of France.\r\nI have made inquiries through Dr. Falconer, and am assured that in\r\nIndia the natives are equally careful in the process of selection. In\r\nChina the production of eggs is confined to certain favourable\r\ndistricts, and the raisers are precluded by law from producing silk, so\r\nthat their whole attention may be necessarily given up to this one\r\nobject.[69]\r\n\r\nThe following details on the differences between the several breeds are\r\ntaken, when not stated to the contrary, from M. Robinet’s excellent\r\nwork,[70] which bears every sign of care and large experience. The\r\n_eggs_ in the different races vary in colour, in shape (being round,\r\nelliptic or oval), and in size. The eggs laid in June in the south of\r\nFrance, and in July in the central provinces, do not hatch until the\r\nfollowing spring; and it is in vain, says M. Robinet, to expose them to\r\na temperature gradually raised, in order that the caterpillar may be\r\nquickly developed. Yet occasionally, without any known cause, batches\r\nof eggs are produced, which immediately begin to undergo the proper\r\nchanges, and are hatched in from twenty to thirty days. From these and\r\nsome other analogous facts it may be concluded that the Trevoltini\r\nsilkworms of Italy, of which the caterpillars are hatched in from\r\nfifteen to twenty days, do not necessarily form, as has been\r\nmaintained, a distinct species. Although the breeds which live in\r\ntemperate countries produce eggs which cannot be immediately hatched by\r\nartificial heat, yet when they are removed to and reared in a hot\r\ncountry they gradually acquire the character of quick development, as\r\nin the Trevoltini races.[71]\r\n\r\n_Caterpillars._—These vary greatly in size and colour. The skin is\r\ngenerally white, sometimes mottled with black or grey, and occasionally\r\nquite black. The colour, however, as M. Robinet asserts, is not\r\nconstant, even in perfectly pure breeds; except in the race _tigrée,_\r\nso called from being marked with transverse black stripes. As the\r\ngeneral colour of the caterpillar is not correlated with that of the\r\nsilk,[72] this character is disregarded by cultivators, and has not\r\nbeen fixed by selection. Captain Hutton, in the paper before referred\r\nto, has argued with much force that the dark tiger-like marks, which so\r\nfrequently appear during the later moults in the caterpillars of\r\nvarious breeds, are due to reversion; for the caterpillars of several\r\nallied wild species of Bombyx are marked and coloured in this manner.\r\nHe separated some caterpillars with the tiger-like marks, and in the\r\nsucceeding spring (pp. 149, 298) nearly all the caterpillars reared\r\nfrom them were dark-brindled, and the tints became still darker in the\r\nthird generation. The moths reared from these caterpillars[73] also\r\nbecame darker, and resembled in colouring the wild _B. huttoni._ On\r\nthis view of the tiger-like marks being due to reversion, the\r\npersistency with which they are transmitted is intelligible.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Mrs. Whitby took great pains in breeding silkworms on\r\na large scale, and she informed me that some of her caterpillars had\r\ndark eyebrows. This is probably the first step in reversion towards the\r\ntiger-like marks, and I was curious to know whether so trifling a\r\ncharacter would be inherited. At my request she separated in 1848\r\ntwenty of these caterpillars, and having kept the moths separate, bred\r\nfrom them. Of the many caterpillars thus reared, “every one without\r\nexception had eyebrows, some darker and more decidedly marked than the\r\nothers, but _all_ had eyebrows more or less plainly visible.” Black\r\ncaterpillars occasionally appear amongst those of the common kind, but\r\nin so variable a manner, that, according to M. Robinet, the same race\r\nwill one year exclusively produce white caterpillars, and the next year\r\nmany black ones; nevertheless, I have been informed by M. A. Bossi of\r\nGeneva, that, if these black caterpillars are separately bred from,\r\nthey reproduce the same colour; but the cocoons and moths reared from\r\nthem do not present any difference.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar in Europe ordinarily moults four times before passing\r\ninto the cocoon stage; but there are races “à trois mues,” and the\r\nTrevoltini race likewise moults only thrice. It might have been thought\r\nthat so important a physiological difference would not have arisen\r\nunder domestication; but M. Robinet[74] states that, on the one hand,\r\nordinary caterpillars occasionally spin their cocoons after only three\r\nmoults, and, on the other hand, “presque toutes les races à trois mues,\r\nque nous avons expérimentees, ont fait quatre mues à la seconde ou à la\r\ntroisième année, ce qui semble prouver qu’il a suffi de les placer dans\r\ndes conditions favorables pour leur rendre une faculté qu’elles avaient\r\nperdue sous des influences moins favorables.”\r\n\r\n_Cocoons._—The caterpillar in changing into the cocoon loses about 50\r\nper cent of its weight; but the amount of loss differs in different\r\nbreeds, and this is of importance to the cultivator. The cocoon in the\r\ndifferent races presents characteristic differences; being large or\r\nsmall;—nearly spherical with no constriction, as in the Race de Loriol,\r\nor cylindrical, with either a deep or slight constriction in the\r\nmiddle; with the two ends, or with one end alone, more or less pointed.\r\nThe silk varies in fineness and quality, and in being nearly white, but\r\nof two tints, or yellow. Generally the colour of the silk is not\r\nstrictly inherited: but in the chapter on Selection I shall give a\r\ncurious account how, in the course of sixty-five generations, the\r\nnumber of yellow cocoons in one breed has been reduced in France from\r\none hundred to thirty-five in the thousand. According to Robinet, the\r\nwhite race, called Sina, by careful selection during the last\r\nseventy-five years, “est arrivée à un tel état de pureté, qu’on ne voit\r\npas un seul cocon jaune dans des millions de cocons blancs.”[75]\r\nCocoons are sometimes formed, as is well known, entirely destitute of\r\nsilk, which yet produce moths; unfortunately Mrs. Whitby was prevented\r\nby an accident from ascertaining whether this character would prove\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\n_Adult stage._—I can find no account of any constant difference in the\r\nmoths of the most distinct races. Mrs. Whitby assured me that there was\r\nnone in the several kinds bred by her; and I have received a similar\r\nstatement from the eminent naturalist, M. de Quatrefages. Captain\r\nHutton also says[76] that the moths of all kinds vary much in colour,\r\nbut in nearly the same inconstant manner. Considering how much the\r\ncocoons in the several races differ, this fact is of interest, and may\r\nprobably be accounted for on the same principle as the fluctuating\r\nvariability of colour in the caterpillar, namely, that there has been\r\nno motive for selecting and perpetuating any particular variation.\r\n\r\nThe males of the wild Bombycidæ “fly swiftly in the day-time and\r\nevening, but the females are usually very sluggish and inactive.”[77]\r\nIn several moths of this family the females have abortive wings, but no\r\ninstance is known of the males being incapable of flight, for in this\r\ncase the species could hardly have been perpetuated. In the silk-moth\r\nboth sexes have imperfect, crumpled wings, and are incapable of flight;\r\nbut still there is a trace of the characteristic difference in the two\r\nsexes; for though, on comparing a number of males and females, I could\r\ndetect no difference in the development of their wings, yet I was\r\nassured by Mrs. Whitby that the males of the moths bred by her used\r\ntheir wings more than the females, and could flutter downwards, though\r\nnever upwards. She also states that, when the females first emerge from\r\nthe cocoon, their wings are less expanded than those of the male. The\r\ndegree of imperfection, however, in the wings varies much in different\r\nraces and under different circumstances. M. Quatrefages[78] says that\r\nhe has seen a number of moths with their wings reduced to a third,\r\nfourth, or tenth part of their normal dimensions, and even to mere\r\nshort straight stumps: “il me semble qu’il y a là un véritable arrêt de\r\ndéveloppement partiel.” On the other hand, he describes the female\r\nmoths of the André Jean breed as having “leurs ailes larges et étalées.\r\nUn seul présente quelques courbures irrégulières et des plis anormaux.”\r\nAs moths and butterflies of all kinds reared from wild caterpillars\r\nunder confinement often have crippled wings, the same cause, whatever\r\nit may be, has probably acted on silk-moths, but the disuse of their\r\nwings during so many generations has, it may be suspected, likewise\r\ncome into play.\r\n\r\nThe moths of many breeds fail to glue their eggs to the surface on\r\nwhich they are laid,[79] but this proceeds, according to Capt.\r\nHutton,[80] merely from the glands of the ovipositor being weakened.\r\n\r\nAs with other long-domesticated animals, the instincts of the silk-moth\r\nhave suffered. The caterpillars, when placed on a mulberry-tree, often\r\ncommit the strange mistake of devouring the base of the leaf on which\r\nthey are feeding, and consequently fall down; but they are capable,\r\naccording to M. Robinet,[81] of again crawling up the trunk. Even this\r\ncapacity sometimes fails, for M. Martins[82] placed some caterpillars\r\non a tree, and those which fell were not able to remount and perished\r\nof hunger; they were even incapable of passing from leaf to leaf.\r\n\r\nSome of the modifications which the silk-moth has undergone stand in\r\ncorrelation with one another. Thus, the eggs of the moths which produce\r\nwhite cocoons and of those which produce yellow cocoons differ slightly\r\nin tint. The abdominal feet, also, of the caterpillars which yield\r\nwhite cocoons are always white, whilst those which give yellow cocoons\r\nare invariably yellow.[83] We have seen that the caterpillars with dark\r\ntiger-like stripes produce moths which are more darkly shaded than\r\nother moths. It seems well established[84] that in France the\r\ncaterpillars of the races which produce white silk, and certain black\r\ncaterpillars, have resisted, better than other races, the disease which\r\nhas recently devastated the silk-districts. Lastly, the races differ\r\nconstitutionally, for some do not succeed so well under a temperate\r\nclimate as others; and a damp soil does not equally injure all the\r\nraces.[85]\r\n\r\nFrom these various facts we learn that silk-moths, like the higher\r\nanimals, vary greatly under long-continued domestication. We learn also\r\nthe more important fact that variations may occur at various periods of\r\nlife, and be inherited at a corresponding period. And finally we see\r\nthat insects are amenable to the great principle of Selection.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Poultry Chronicle,’ 1854, vol. ii. p. 91 and vol. i. p. 330.\r\n\r\n [2] Dr. Turral, ‘Bull.

The subject is involved\r\nin much difficulty. Botanists have generally neglected cultivated\r\nvarieties, as beneath their notice. In several cases the wild prototype\r\nis unknown or doubtfully known; and in other cases it is hardly\r\npossible to distinguish between escaped seedlings and truly wild\r\nplants, so that there is no safe standard of comparison by which to\r\njudge of any supposed amount of change. Not a few botanists believe\r\nthat several of our anciently cultivated plants have become so\r\nprofoundly modified that it is not possible now to recognise their\r\naboriginal parent-forms. Equally perplexing are the doubts whether some\r\nof them are descended from one species, or from several inextricably\r\ncommingled by crossing and variation. Variations often pass into, and\r\ncannot be distinguished from, monstrosities; and monstrosities are of\r\nlittle significance for our purpose. Many varieties are propagated\r\nsolely by grafts, buds, layers, bulbs, etc., and frequently it is not\r\nknown how far their peculiarities can be transmitted by seminal\r\ngeneration. Nevertheless, some facts of value can be gleaned: and other\r\nfacts will hereafter be incidentally given. One chief object in the two\r\nfollowing chapters is to show how many characters in our cultivated\r\nplants have become variable.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on details a few general remarks on the origin of\r\ncultivated plants may be introduced. M. Alph. De Candolle[1] in an\r\nadmirable discussion on this subject, in which he displays a wonderful\r\namount of knowledge, gives a list of 157 of the most useful cultivated\r\nplants. Of these he believes that 85 are almost certainly known in\r\ntheir wild state; but on this head other competent judges[2] entertain\r\ngreat doubts. Of 40 of them, the origin is admitted by M. De Candolle\r\nto be doubtful, either from a certain amount of dissimilarity which\r\nthey present when compared with their nearest allies in a wild state,\r\nor from the probability of the latter not being truly wild plants, but\r\nseedlings escaped from culture. Of the entire 157, 32 alone are ranked\r\nby M. De Candolle as quite unknown in their aboriginal condition. But\r\nit should be observed that he does not include in his list several\r\nplants which present ill-defined characters, namely, the various forms\r\nof pumpkins, millet, sorghum, kidney-bean, dolichos, capsicum, and\r\nindigo. Nor does he include flowers; and several of the more anciently\r\ncultivated flowers, such as certain roses, the common Imperial lily,\r\nthe tuberose, and even the lilac, are said[3] not to be known in the\r\nwild state.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative numbers above given, and from other arguments of much\r\nweight, M. De Candolle concludes that plants have rarely been so much\r\nmodified by culture that they cannot be identified with their wild\r\nprototypes. But on this view, considering that savages probably would\r\nnot have chosen rare plants for cultivation, that useful plants are\r\ngenerally conspicuous, and that they could not have been the\r\ninhabitants of deserts or of remote and recently discovered islands, it\r\nappears strange to me that so many of our cultivated plants should be\r\nstill unknown or only doubtfully known in the wild state. If, on the\r\nother hand, many of these plants have been profoundly modified by\r\nculture, the difficulty disappears. The difficulty would also be\r\nremoved if they have been exterminated during the progress of\r\ncivilisation; but M. De Candolle has shown that this probably has\r\nseldom occurred. As soon as a plant was cultivated in any country, the\r\nhalf-civilised inhabitants would no longer have need to search the\r\nwhole surface of the land for it, and thus lead to its extirpation; and\r\neven if this did occur during a famine, dormant seeds would be left in\r\nthe ground. In tropical countries the wild luxuriance of nature, as was\r\nlong ago remarked by Humboldt, overpowers the feeble efforts of man. In\r\nanciently civilised temperate countries, where the whole face of the\r\nland has been greatly changed, it can hardly be doubted that some\r\nplants have become extinct; nevertheless De Candolle has shown that all\r\nthe plants historically known to have been first cultivated in Europe\r\nstill exist here in the wild state.\r\n\r\nMM. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps[4] and De Candolle have remarked that our\r\ncultivated plants, more especially the cereals, must originally have\r\nexisted in nearly their present state; for otherwise they would not\r\nhave been noticed and valued as objects of food. But these authors\r\napparently have not considered the many accounts given by travellers of\r\nthe wretched food collected by savages. I have read an account of the\r\nsavages of Australia cooking, during a dearth, many vegetables in\r\nvarious ways, in the hopes of rendering them innocuous and more\r\nnutritious. Dr. Hooker found the half-starved inhabitants of a village\r\nin Sikhim suffering greatly from having eaten arum-roots,[5] which they\r\nhad pounded and left for several days to ferment, so as partially to\r\ndestroy their poisonous nature; and he adds that they cooked and ate\r\nmany other deleterious plants. Sir Andrew Smith informs me that in\r\nSouth Africa a large number of fruits and succulent leaves, and\r\nespecially roots, are used in times of scarcity. The natives, indeed,\r\nknow the properties of a long catalogue of plants, some having been\r\nfound during famines to be eatable, others injurious to health, or even\r\ndestructive to life. He met a party of Baquanas who, having been\r\nexpelled by the conquering Zulus, had lived for years on any roots or\r\nleaves which afforded some little nutriment and distended their\r\nstomachs, so as to relieve the pangs of hunger. They looked like\r\nwalking skeletons, and suffered fearfully from constipation. Sir Andrew\r\nSmith also informs me that on such occasions the natives observe as a\r\nguide for themselves, what the wild animals, especially baboons and\r\nmonkeys, eat.\r\n\r\nFrom innumerable experiments made through dire necessity by the savages\r\nof every land, with the results handed down by tradition, the\r\nnutritious, stimulating, and medicinal properties of the most\r\nunpromising plants were probably first discovered. It appears, for\r\ninstance, at first an inexplicable fact that untutored man, in three\r\ndistant quarters of the world, should have discovered, amongst a host\r\nof native plants, that the leaves of the tea-plant and mattee, and the\r\nberries of the coffee, all included a stimulating and nutritious\r\nessence, now known to be chemically the same. We can also see that\r\nsavages suffering from severe constipation would naturally observe\r\nwhether any of the roots which they devoured acted as aperients. We\r\nprobably owe our knowledge of the uses of almost all plants to man\r\nhaving originally existed in a barbarous state, and having been often\r\ncompelled by severe want to try as food almost everything which he\r\ncould chew and swallow.\r\n\r\nFrom what we know of the habits of savages in many quarters of the\r\nworld, there is no reason to suppose that our cereal plants originally\r\nexisted in their present state so valuable to man. Let us look to one\r\ncontinent alone, namely, Africa: Barth[6] states that the slaves over a\r\nlarge part of the central region regularly collect the seeds of a wild\r\ngrass, the _Pennisetum distichum_; in another district he saw women\r\ncollecting the seeds of a Poa by swinging a sort of basket through the\r\nrich meadow-land. Near Tete, Livingstone observed the natives\r\ncollecting the seeds of a wild grass, and farther south, as Andersson\r\ninforms me, the natives largely use the seed of a grass of about the\r\nsize of canary-seed, which they boil in water. They eat also the roots\r\nof certain reeds, and every one has read of the Bushmen prowling about\r\nand digging up with a fire-hardened stake various roots. Similar facts\r\nwith respect to the collection of seeds of wild grasses in other parts\r\nof the world could be given.[7]\r\n\r\nAccustomed as we are to our excellent vegetables and luscious fruits,\r\nwe can hardly persuade ourselves that the stringy roots of the wild\r\ncarrot and parsnip, or the little shoots of the wild asparagus, or\r\ncrabs, sloes, etc., should ever have been valued; yet, from what we\r\nknow of the habits of Australian and South African savages, we need\r\nfeel no doubt on this head. The inhabitants of Switzerland during the\r\nStone-period largely collected wild crabs, sloes, bullaces, hips of\r\nroses, elderberries, beechmast, and other wild berries and fruit.[8]\r\nJemmy Button, a Fuegian on board the ‘Beagle,’ remarked to me that the\r\npoor and acid black-currants of Tierra del Fuego were too sweet for his\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nThe savage inhabitants of each land, having found out by many and hard\r\ntrials what plants were useful, or could be rendered useful by various\r\ncooking processes, would after a time take the first step in\r\ncultivation by planting them near their usual abodes. Livingstone[9]\r\nstates that the savage Batokas sometimes left wild fruit-trees standing\r\nin their gardens, and occasionally even planted them, “a practice seen\r\nnowhere else amongst the natives.” But Du Chaillu saw a palm and some\r\nother wild fruit-trees which had been planted; and these trees were\r\nconsidered private property. The next step in cultivation, and this\r\nwould require but little forethought, would be to sow the seeds of\r\nuseful plants; and as the soil near the hovels of the natives[10] would\r\noften be in some degree manured, improved varieties would sooner or\r\nlater arise. Or a wild and unusually good variety of a native plant\r\nmight attract the attention of some wise old savage; and he would\r\ntransplant it, or sow its seed. That superior varieties of wild\r\nfruit-trees occasionally are found is certain, as in the case of the\r\nAmerican species of hawthorns, plums, cherries, grapes, and hickories,\r\nspecified by Professor Asa Gray.[11] Downing also refers to certain\r\nwild varieties of the hickory, as being “of much larger size and finer\r\nflavour than the common species.” I have referred to American\r\nfruit-trees, because we are not in this case troubled with doubts\r\nwhether or not the varieties are seedlings which have escaped from\r\ncultivation. Transplanting any superior variety, or sowing its seeds,\r\nhardly implies more forethought than might be expected at an early and\r\nrude period of civilisation. Even the Australian barbarians “have a law\r\nthat no plant bearing seeds is to be dug up after it has flowered;” and\r\nSir G. Grey[12] never saw this law, evidently framed for the\r\npreservation of the plant, violated. We see the same spirit in the\r\nsuperstitious belief of the Fuegians, that killing water-fowl whilst\r\nvery young will be followed by “much rain, snow, blow much.”[13] I may\r\nadd, as showing forethought in the lowest barbarians, that the Fuegians\r\nwhen they find a stranded whale bury large portions in the sand, and\r\nduring the often-recurrent famines travel from great distances for the\r\nremnants of the half-putrid mass.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked[1] that we do not owe a single useful plant\r\nto Australia or the Cape of Good Hope, countries abounding to an\r\nunparalleled degree with endemic species,—or to New Zealand, or to\r\nAmerica south of the Plata; and, according to some authors, not to\r\nAmerica northward of Mexico. I do not believe that any edible or\r\nvaluable plant, except the canary-grass, has been derived from an\r\noceanic or uninhabited island. If nearly all our useful plants, natives\r\nof Europe; Asia, and South America, had originally existed in their\r\npresent condition, the complete absence of similarly useful plants in\r\nthe great countries just named would be indeed a surprising fact. But\r\nif these plants have been so greatly modified and improved by culture\r\nas no longer closely to resemble any natural species, we can understand\r\nwhy the above-named countries have given us no useful plants, for they\r\nwere either inhabited by men who did not cultivate the ground at all,\r\nas in Australia and the Cape of Good Hope, or who cultivated it very\r\nimperfectly, as in some parts of America. These countries do yield\r\nplants which are useful to savage man; and Dr. Hooker[15] enumerates no\r\nless than 107 such species in Australia alone; but these plants have\r\nnot been improved, and consequently cannot compete with those which\r\nhave been cultivated and improved during thousands of years in the\r\ncivilised world.\r\n\r\nThe case of New Zealand, to which fine island we as yet owe no widely\r\ncultivated plant, may seem opposed to this view; for, when first\r\ndiscovered, the natives cultivated several plants; but all inquirers\r\nbelieve, in accordance with the traditions of the natives, that the\r\nearly Polynesian colonists brought with them seeds and roots, as well\r\nas the dog, which had been wisely preserved during their long voyage.\r\nThe Polynesians are so frequently lost on the ocean that this degree of\r\nprudence would occur to any wandering party: hence the early colonists\r\nof New Zealand, like the later European colonists, would not have had\r\nany strong inducement to cultivate the aboriginal plants. According to\r\nDe Candolle we owe thirty-three useful plants to Mexico, Peru, and\r\nChile; nor is this surprising when we remember the civilised state of\r\nthe inhabitants, as shown by the fact of their having practised\r\nartificial irrigation and made tunnels through hard rocks without the\r\nuse of iron or gunpowder, and who, as we shall see in a future chapter,\r\nfully recognised, as far as animals were concerned, and therefore\r\nprobably in the case of plants, the important principle of selection.\r\nWe owe some plants to Brazil; and the early voyagers, namely, Vespucius\r\nand Cabral, describe the country as thickly peopled and cultivated. In\r\nNorth America[16] the natives cultivated maize, pumpkins, gourds,\r\nbeans, and peas, “all different from ours,” and tobacco; and we are\r\nhardly justified in assuming that none of our present plants are\r\ndescended from these North American forms. Had North America been\r\ncivilised for as long a period, and as thickly peopled, as Asia or\r\nEurope, it is probable that the native vines, walnuts, mulberries,\r\ncrabs, and plums, would have given rise, after a long course of\r\ncultivation, to a multitude of varieties, some extremely different from\r\ntheir parent-stocks; and escaped seedlings would have caused in the\r\nNew, as in the Old World, much perplexity with respect to their\r\nspecific distinctness and parentage.’[17]\r\n\r\n_Cerealia._—I will now enter on details. The cereals cultivated in\r\nEurope consist of four genera—wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Of wheat\r\nthe best modern authorities[18] make four or five, or even seven\r\ndistinct species; of rye, one; of barley, three; and of oats, two,\r\nthree, or four species. So that altogether our cereals are ranked by\r\ndifferent authors under from ten to fifteen distinct species. These\r\nhave given rise to a multitude of varieties. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat botanists are not universally agreed on the aboriginal parent-form\r\nof any one cereal plant. For instance, a high authority writes in\r\n1855,[19] “We ourselves have no hesitation in stating our conviction,\r\nas the result of all the most reliable evidence, that none of these\r\nCerealia exist, or have existed, truly wild in their present state, but\r\nthat all are cultivated varieties of species now growing in great\r\nabundance in S. Europe or W. Asia.” On the other hand, Alph. De\r\nCandolle[20] has adduced abundant evidence that common wheat (_Triticum\r\nvulgare_) has been found wild in various parts of Asia, where it is not\r\nlikely to have escaped from cultivation: and there is some force in M.\r\nGodron’s remark, that, supposing these plants to be escaped\r\nseedlings,[21] as they have propagated themselves in a wild state for\r\nseveral generations, their continued resemblance to cultivated wheat\r\nrenders it probable that the latter has retained its aboriginal\r\ncharacter. But the strong tendency to inheritance, which most of the\r\nvarieties of wheat evince, as we shall presently see, is here greatly\r\nundervalued. Much weight must also be attributed to a remark by\r\nProfessor Hildebrand[22] that when the seeds or fruit of cultivated\r\nplants possess qualities disadvantageous to them as a means of\r\ndistribution, we may feel almost sure that they no longer retain their\r\naboriginal condition. On the other hand, M. De Candolle insists\r\nstrongly on the frequent occurrence in the Austrian dominions of rye\r\nand of one kind of oats in an apparently wild condition. With the\r\nexception of these two cases, which however are rather doubtful, and\r\nwith the exception of two forms of wheat and one of barley, which he\r\nbelieves to have been found truly wild, M. De Candolle does not seem\r\nfully satisfied with the other reported discoveries of the parent-forms\r\nof our other cereals. With respect to oats, according to Mr.\r\nBuckmann,[23] the wild English _Avena fatua_ can be converted by a few\r\nyears of careful cultivation and selection into forms almost identical\r\nwith two very distinct cultivated races. The whole subject of the\r\norigin and specific distinctness of the various cereal plants is a most\r\ndifficult one; but we shall perhaps be able to judge a little better\r\nafter considering the amount of variation which wheat has undergone.\r\n\r\nMetzger describes seven species of wheat, Godron refers to five, and De\r\nCandolle to only four. It is not improbable that, besides the kinds\r\nknown in Europe, other strongly characterised forms exist in the more\r\ndistant parts of the world; for Loiseleur-Deslongchamps[24] speaks of\r\nthree new species or varieties, sent to Europe in 1822 from Chinese\r\nMongolia, which he considers as being there indigenous. Moorcroft[25]\r\nalso speaks of Hasora wheat in Ladakh as very peculiar. If those\r\nbotanists are right who believe that at least seven species of wheat\r\noriginally existed, then the amount of variation in any important\r\ncharacter which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been slight;\r\nbut if only four or a lesser number of species originally existed, then\r\nit is evident that varieties have arisen so strongly marked, that they\r\nhave been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct. But\r\nthe impossibility of deciding which forms ought to be ranked as species\r\nand which as varieties, makes it useless to specify in detail the\r\ndifferences between the various kinds of wheat. Speaking generally, the\r\norgans of vegetation differ little;[26] but some kinds grow close and\r\nupright, whilst others spread and trail along the ground. The straw\r\ndiffers in being more or less hollow, and in quality. The ears[27]\r\ndiffer in colour and in shape, being quadrangular, compressed, or\r\nnearly cylindrical; and the florets differ in their approximation to\r\neach other, in their pubescence, and in being more or less elongated.\r\nThe presence or absence of barbs is a conspicuous difference, and in\r\ncertain Gramineæ serves even as a generic character;[28] although, as\r\nremarked by Godron,[29] the presence of barbs is variable in certain\r\nwild grasses, and especially in those such as _Bromus secalinus_ and\r\n_Lolium temulentum,_ which habitually grow mingled with our cereal\r\ncrops, and which have thus unintentionally been exposed to culture. The\r\ngrains differ in size, weight, and colour; in being more or less downy\r\nat one end, in being smooth or wrinkled, in being either nearly\r\nglobular, oval, or elongated; and finally in internal texture, being\r\ntender or hard, or even almost horny, and in the proportion of gluten\r\nwhich they contain.\r\n\r\nNearly all the races or species of wheat vary, as Godron[30] has\r\nremarked, in an exactly parallel manner,—in the seed being downy or\r\nglabrous, and in colour,—and in the florets being barbed or not barbed,\r\netc. Those who believe that all the kinds are descended from a single\r\nwild species may account for this parallel variation by the inheritance\r\nof a similar constitution, and a consequent tendency to vary in the\r\nsame manner; and those who believe in the general theory of descent\r\nwith modification may extend this view to the several species of wheat,\r\nif such ever existed in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nAlthough few of the varieties of wheat present any conspicuous\r\ndifference, their number is great. Dalbret cultivated during thirty\r\nyears from 150 to 160 kinds, and excepting in the quality of the grain\r\nthey all kept true; Colonel Le Couteur possessed upwards of 150, and\r\nPhilippar 322 varieties.[31] As wheat is an annual, we thus see how\r\nstrictly many trifling differences in character are inherited through\r\nmany generations. Colonel Le Couteur insists strongly on this same\r\nfact. In his persevering and successful attempts to raise new\r\nvarieties, he found that there was only one “secure mode to ensure the\r\ngrowth of pure sorts, namely, to grow them from single grains or from\r\nsingle ears, and to follow up the plan by afterwards sowing only the\r\nproduce of the most productive so as to form a stock.” But Major\r\nHallett[32] has gone much farther, and by the continued selection of\r\nplants from the grains of the same ear, during successive generations,\r\nhas made his ‘Pedigree in Wheat’ (and other cereals) now famous in many\r\nquarters of the world. The great amount of variability in the plants of\r\nthe same variety is another interesting point, which would never have\r\nbeen detected except by an eye long practised to the work; thus Colonel\r\nLe Couteur relates[33] that in a field of his own wheat, which he\r\nconsidered at least as pure as that of any of his neighbours, Professor\r\nLa Gasca found twenty-three sorts; and Professor Henslow has observed\r\nsimilar facts. Besides such individual variations, forms sufficiently\r\nwell marked to be valued and to become widely cultivated sometimes\r\nsuddenly appear: thus Mr. Shirreff has had the good fortune to raise in\r\nhis lifetime seven new varieties, which are now extensively grown in\r\nmany parts of Britain.[34]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of many other plants, some varieties, both old and new,\r\nare far more constant in character than others. Colonel Le Couteur was\r\nforced to reject some of his new sub-varieties, which he suspected had\r\nbeen produced from a cross, as incorrigibly sportive. On the other hand\r\nMajor Hallett[35] has shown how wonderfully constant some varieties\r\nare, although not ancient ones, and although cultivated in various\r\ncountries. With respect to the tendency to vary, Metzger[36] gives from\r\nhis own experience some interesting facts: he describes three Spanish\r\nsub-varieties, more especially one known to be constant in Spain, which\r\nin Germany assumed their proper character only during hot summers;\r\nanother variety kept true only in good land, but after having been\r\ncultivated for twenty-five years became more constant. He mentions two\r\nother sub-varieties which were at first inconstant, but subsequently\r\nbecame, apparently without any selection, accustomed to their new\r\nhomes, and retained their proper character. These facts show what small\r\nchanges in the conditions of life cause variability, and they further\r\nshow that a variety may become habituated to new conditions. One is at\r\nfirst inclined to conclude with Loiseleur-Deslongchamps, that wheat\r\ncultivated in the same country is exposed to remarkably uniform\r\nconditions; but manures differ, seed is taken from one soil to another,\r\nand, what is far more important, the plants are exposed as little as\r\npossible to struggle with other plants, and are thus enabled to exist\r\nunder diversified conditions. In a state of nature each plant is\r\nconfined to that particular station and kind of nutriment which it can\r\nseize from the other plants by which it is surrounded.\r\n\r\nWheat quickly assumes new habits of life. The summer and winter kinds\r\nwere classed by Linnæus as distinct species; but M. Monnier[37] has\r\nproved that the difference between them is only temporary. He sowed\r\nwinter-wheat in spring, and out of one hundred plants four alone\r\nproduced ripe seeds; these were sown and resown, and in three years\r\nplants were reared which ripened all their seed. Conversely, nearly all\r\nthe plants raised from summer-wheat, which was sown in autumn, perished\r\nfrom frost; but a few were saved and produced seed, and in three years\r\nthis summer-variety was converted into a winter-variety. Hence it is\r\nnot surprising that wheat soon becomes to a certain extent\r\nacclimatised, and that seed brought from distant countries and sown in\r\nEurope vegetates at first, or even for a considerable period,[38]\r\ndifferently from our European varieties. In Canada the first settlers,\r\naccording to Kalm,[39] found their winters too severe for winter-wheat\r\nbrought from France, and their summers often too short for\r\nsummer-wheat; and they thought that their country was useless for corn\r\ncrops until they procured summer-wheat from the northern parts of\r\nEurope, which succeeded well. It is notorious that the proportion of\r\ngluten differs much under different climates. The weight of the grain\r\nis also quickly affected by climate: Loiseleur-Deslongchamps[40] sowed\r\nnear Paris 54 varieties, obtained from the South of France and from the\r\nBlack Sea, and 52 of these yielded seed from 10 to 40 per cent heavier\r\nthan the parent-seed. He then sent these heavier grains back to the\r\nSouth of France, but there they immediately yielded lighter seed.\r\n\r\nAll those who have closely attended to the subject insist on the close\r\nadaptation of numerous varieties of wheat to various soils and climates\r\neven within the same country; thus Colonel Le Couteur[41] says, “It is\r\nthe suitableness of each sort to each soil that will enable the farmer\r\nto pay his rent by sowing one variety, where he would be unable to do\r\nso by attempting to grow another of a seemingly better sort.” This may\r\nbe in part due to each kind becoming habituated to its conditions of\r\nlife, as Metzger has shown certainly occurs, but it is probably in main\r\npart due to innate differences between the several varieties.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the deterioration of wheat; that the quality\r\nof the flour, size of grain, time of flowering, and hardness, may be\r\nmodified by climate and soil, seems nearly certain; but that the whole\r\nbody of any one sub-variety ever becomes changed into another and\r\ndistinct sub-variety, there is no reason to believe. What apparently\r\ndoes take place, according to Le Couteur,[42] is, that some one\r\nsub-variety out of the many which may always be detected in the same\r\nfield is more prolific than the others, and gradually supplants the\r\nvariety which was first sown.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the natural crossing of distinct varieties the evidence\r\nis conflicting, but preponderates against its frequent occurrence. Many\r\nauthors maintain that impregnation takes place in the closed flower,\r\nbut I am sure from my own observation that this is not the case, at\r\nleast with those varieties to which I have attended. But as I shall\r\nhave to discuss this subject in another work, it may be here passed\r\nover.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, all authors admit that numerous varieties of wheat have\r\narisen; but their differences are unimportant, unless, indeed, some of\r\nthe so-called species are ranked as varieties. Those who believe that\r\nfrom four to seven wild species of Triticum originally existed in\r\nnearly the same condition as at present, rest their belief chiefly on\r\nthe great antiquity of the several forms.[43] It is an important fact,\r\nwhich we have recently learnt from the admirable researches of\r\nHeer,[44] that the inhabitants of Switzerland, even so early as the\r\nNeolithic period, cultivated no less than ten cereal plants, namely,\r\nfive kinds of wheat, of which at least four are commonly looked at as\r\ndistinct species, three kinds of barley, a panicum, and a setaria. If\r\nit could be shown that at the earliest dawn of agriculture five kinds\r\nof wheat and three of barley had been cultivated, we should of course\r\nbe compelled to look at these forms as distinct species. But, as Heer\r\nhas remarked, agriculture even at the Neolithic period, had already\r\nmade considerable progress; for, besides the cereals, peas, poppies,\r\nflax, and apparently apples, were cultivated. It may also be inferred,\r\nfrom one variety of wheat being the so called Egyptian, and from what\r\nis known of the native country of the panicum and setaria, as well as\r\nfrom the nature of the weeds which then grew mingled with the crops,\r\nthat the lake-inhabitants either still kept up commercial intercourse\r\nwith some southern people or had originally proceeded as colonists from\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nLoiseleur-Deslongchamps[45] has argued that, if our cereal plants have\r\nbeen greatly modified by cultivation, the weeds which habitually grow\r\nmingled with them would have been equally modified. But this argument\r\nshows how completely the principle of selection has been overlooked.\r\nThat such weeds have not varied, or at least do not vary now in any\r\nextreme degree, is the opinion of Mr. H. C. Watson and Professor Asa\r\nGray, as they inform me; but who will pretend to say that they do not\r\nvary as much as the individual plants of the same sub-variety of wheat?\r\nWe have already seen that pure varieties of wheat, cultivated in the\r\nsame field, offer many slight variations, which can be selected and\r\nseparately propagated; and that occasionally more strongly pronounced\r\nvariations appear, which, as Mr. Shirreff has proved, are well worthy\r\nof extensive cultivation. Not until equal attention be paid to the\r\nvariability and selection of weeds, can the argument from their\r\nconstancy under unintentional culture be of any value. In accordance\r\nwith the principles of selection we can understand how it is that in\r\nthe several cultivated varieties of wheat the organs of vegetation\r\ndiffer so little; for if a plant with peculiar leaves appeared, it\r\nwould be neglected unless the grains of corn were at the same time\r\nsuperior in quality or size. the selection of seed-corn was strongly\r\nrecommended[46] in ancient times by Columella and Celsus; and as Virgil\r\nsays,—\r\n\r\n      “I’ve seen the largest seeds, tho’ view’d with care,\r\n      Degenerate, unless th’ industrious hand\r\n      Did yearly cull the largest.”\r\n\r\nBut whether in ancient times selection was methodically pursued we may\r\nwell doubt, when we hear how laborious the work has been found by Le\r\nCoutour and Hallett. Although the principle of selection is so\r\nimportant, yet the little which man has effected, by incessant\r\nefforts[47] during thousands of years, in rendering the plants more\r\nproductive or the grains more nutritious than they were in the time of\r\nthe old Egyptians, would seem to speak strongly against its efficacy.\r\nBut we must not forget that at each successive period the state of\r\nagriculture and the quantity of manure supplied to the land will have\r\ndetermined the maximum degree of productiveness; for it would be\r\nimpossible to cultivate a highly productive variety, unless the land\r\ncontained a sufficient supply of the necessary chemical elements.\r\n\r\nWe now know that man was sufficiently civilised to cultivate the ground\r\nat an immensely remote period; so that wheat might have been improved\r\nlong ago up to that standard of excellence which was possible under the\r\nthen existing state of agriculture. One small class of facts supports\r\nthis view of the slow and gradual improvement of our cereals. In the\r\nmost ancient lake-habitations of Switzerland, when men employed only\r\nflint-tools, the most extensively cultivated wheat was a peculiar kind,\r\nwith remarkably small ears and grains.[48] “Whilst the grains of the\r\nmodern forms are in section from seven to eight millimetres in length,\r\nthe larger grains from the lake-habitations are six, seldom seven, and\r\nthe smaller ones only four. The ear is thus much narrower, and the\r\nspikelets stand out more horizontally, than in our present forms.” So\r\nagain with barley, the most ancient and most extensively cultivated\r\nkind had small ears, and the grains were “smaller, shorter, and nearer\r\nto each other, than in that now grown; without the husk they were 2½\r\nlines long, and scarcely 1½ broad, whilst those now grown have a length\r\nof three lines, and almost the same in breadth.”[49] These\r\nsmall-grained varieties of wheat and barley are believed by Heer to be\r\nthe parent-forms of certain existing allied varieties, which have\r\nsupplanted their early progenitors.\r\n\r\nHeer gives an interesting account of the first appearance and final\r\ndisappearance of the several plants which were cultivated in greater or\r\nless abundance in Switzerland during former successive periods, and\r\nwhich generally differed more or less from our existing varieties. The\r\npeculiar small-eared and small-grained wheat, already alluded to, was\r\nthe commonest kind during the Stone period; it lasted down to the\r\nHelvetico-Roman age, and then became extinct. A second kind was rare at\r\nfirst, but afterwards became more frequent. A third, the Egyptian wheat\r\n(_T. turgidum_), does not agree exactly with any existing variety, and\r\nwas rare during the Stone period. A fourth kind (_T. dicoccum_) differs\r\nfrom all known varieties of this form. A fifth kind (_T. monococcum_)\r\nis known to have existed during the Stone period only by the presence\r\nof a single ear. A sixth kind, the common _T. spelta,_ was not\r\nintroduced into Switzerland until the Bronze age. Of barley, besides\r\nthe short-eared and small-grained kind, two others were cultivated, one\r\nof which was very scarce, and resembled our present common _H.\r\ndistichum._ During the Bronze age rye and oats were introduced; the\r\noat-grains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our existing\r\nvarieties. The poppy was largely cultivated during the Stone period,\r\nprobably for its oil; but the variety which then existed is not now\r\nknown. A peculiar pea with small seeds lasted from the Stone to the\r\nBronze age, and then became extinct; whilst a peculiar bean, likewise\r\nhaving small seeds, came in at the Bronze period and lasted to the time\r\nof the Romans. These details sound like the descriptions given by\r\npalæontologists of the first appearance, the increasing rarity, and\r\nfinal extinction or modification of fossil species, embedded in the\r\nsuccessive stages of a geological formation.\r\n\r\nFinally, every one must judge for himself whether it is more probable\r\nthat the several forms of wheat, barley, rye, and oats are descended\r\nfrom between ten and fifteen species, most of which are now either\r\nunknown or extinct, or whether they are descended from between four and\r\neight species, which may have either closely resembled our present\r\ncultivated forms, or have been so widely different as to escape\r\nidentification. In this latter case we must conclude that man\r\ncultivated the cereals at an enormously remote period, and that he\r\nformerly practised some degree of selection, which in itself is not\r\nimprobable. We may, perhaps, further believe that, when wheat was first\r\ncultivated the ears and grains increased quickly in size, in the same\r\nmanner as the roots of the wild carrot and parsnip are known to\r\nincrease quickly in bulk under cultivation.\r\n\r\n_Maize or Indian Corn: Zea mays._—Botanists are nearly unanimous that\r\nall the cultivated kinds belong to the same species. It is\r\nundoubtedly[50] of American origin, and was grown by the aborigines\r\nthroughout the continent from New England to Chili. Its cultivation\r\nmust have been extremely ancient, for Tschudi[51] describes two kinds,\r\nnow extinct or not known in Peru, which were taken from tombs\r\napparently prior to the dynasty of the Incas. ‘But there is even\r\nstronger evidence of antiquity, for I found on the coast of Peru[52]\r\nheads of maize, together with eighteen species of recent sea-shell,\r\nembedded in a beach which had been upraised at least 85 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. In accordance with this ancient cultivation, numerous\r\nAmerican varieties have arisen. The aboriginal form has not as yet been\r\ndiscovered in the wild state. A peculiar kind,[53] in which the grains,\r\ninstead of being naked, are concealed by husks as much as eleven lines\r\nin length, has been stated, but on insufficient evidence, to grow wild\r\nin Brazil. It is almost certain that the aboriginal form would have had\r\nits grains thus protected;[54] but the seeds of the Brazilian variety\r\nproduce, as I hear from Professor Asa Gray, and as is stated in two\r\npublished accounts, either common or husked maize; and it is not\r\ncredible that a wild species, when first cultivated, should vary so\r\nquickly and in so great a degree.\r\n\r\nMaize has varied in an extraordinary and conspicuous manner.\r\nMetzger,[55] who paid particular attention to the cultivation of this\r\nplant, makes twelve races (unter-art) with numerous sub-varieties: of\r\nthe latter some are tolerably constant, others quite inconstant. The\r\ndifferent races vary in height from 15-18 feet to only 16-18 inches, as\r\nin a dwarf variety described by Bonafous. The whole ear is variable in\r\nshape, being long and narrow, or short and thick, or branched. The ear\r\nin one variety is more than four times as long as in a dwarf kind. The\r\nseeds are arranged in the ear in from six to even twenty rows, or are\r\nplaced irregularly. The seeds are coloured—white, pale-yellow, orange,\r\nred, violet, or elegantly streaked with black;[56] and in the same ear\r\nthere are sometimes seeds of two colours. In a small collection I found\r\nthat a single grain of one variety nearly equalled in weight seven\r\ngrains of another variety. The shape of the seed varies greatly, being\r\nvery flat, or nearly globular, or oval; broader than long, or longer\r\nthan broad; without any point, or produced into a sharp tooth, and this\r\ntooth is sometimes recurved. One variety (the rugosa of Bonafous, and\r\nwhich is extensively cultivated in the United States as sweet corn) has\r\nits seeds curiously wrinkled, giving to the whole ear a singular\r\nappearance. Another variety (the cymosa of Bon.) carries its ears so\r\ncrowded together that it is called _maïs à bouquet._ The seeds of some\r\nvarieties contain much glucose instead of starch. Male flowers\r\nsometimes appear amongst the female flowers, and Mr. J. Scott has\r\nlately observed the rarer case of female flowers on a true male\r\npanicle, and likewise hermaphrodite flowers.[57] Azara describes[58] a\r\nvariety in Paraguay the grains of which are very tender, and he states\r\nthat several varieties are fitted for being cooked in various ways. The\r\nvarieties also differ greatly in precocity, and have different powers\r\nof resisting dryness and the action of violent wind.[59] Some of the\r\nforegoing differences would certainly be considered of specific value\r\nwith plants in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nLe Comte Ré states that the grains of all the varieties which he\r\ncultivated ultimately assumed a yellow colour. But Bonafous[60] found\r\nthat most of those which he sowed for ten consecutive years kept true\r\nto their proper tints; and he adds that in the valleys of the Pyrenees\r\nand on the plains of Piedmont a white maize has been cultivated for\r\nmore than a century, and has undergone no change.\r\n\r\nThe tall kinds grown in southern latitudes, and therefore exposed to\r\ngreat heat, require from six to seven months to ripen their seed;\r\nwhereas the dwarf kinds, grown in northern and colder climates, require\r\nonly from three to four months.[61] Peter Kalm,[62] who particularly\r\nattended to this plant, says, that in the United States, in proceeding\r\nfrom south to north, the plants steadily diminish in bulk. Seeds\r\nbrought from lat. 37° in Virginia, and sown in lat. 43°-44° in New\r\nEngland, produce plants which will not ripen their seed, or ripen them\r\nwith the utmost difficulty. So it is with seed carried from New England\r\nto lat. 45°-47° in Canada. By taking great care at first, the southern\r\nkinds after some years’ culture ripen their seed perfectly in their\r\nnorthern homes, so that this is an analogous case with that of the\r\nconversion of summer into winter wheat, and conversely. When tall and\r\ndwarf maize are planted together, the dwarf kinds are in full flower\r\nbefore the others have produced a single flower; and in Pennsylvania\r\nthey ripen their seeds six weeks earlier than the tall maize. Metzger\r\nalso mentions a European maize which ripens its seed four weeks earlier\r\nthan another European kind. With these facts, so plainly showing\r\ninherited acclimatisation, we may readily believe Kalm, who states that\r\nin North America maize and some other plants have gradually been\r\ncultivated further and further northward. All writers agree that to\r\nkeep the varieties of maize pure they must be planted separately so\r\nthat they shall not cross.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the climate of Europe on the American varieties is\r\nhighly remarkable. Metzger obtained seed from various parts of America,\r\nand cultivated several kinds in Germany. I will give an abstract of the\r\nchanges observed[63] in one case, namely, with a tall kind\r\n(Breit-korniger mais, _Zea altissima_) brought from the warmer parts of\r\nAmerica. During the first year the plants were twelve feet high, and a\r\nfew seeds were perfected; the lower seeds in the ear kept true to their\r\nproper form, but the upper seeds became slightly changed. In the second\r\ngeneration the plants were from nine to ten feet in height, and ripened\r\ntheir seed better; the depression on the outer side of the seed had\r\nalmost disappeared, and the original beautiful white colour had become\r\nduskier. Some of the seeds had even become yellow, and in their now\r\nrounded form they approached common European maize. In the third\r\ngeneration nearly all resemblance to the original and very distinct\r\nAmerican parent-form was lost. In the sixth generation this maize\r\nperfectly resembled a European variety, described as the second\r\nsub-variety of the fifth race. When Metzger published his book, this\r\nvariety was still cultivated near Heidelberg, and could be\r\ndistinguished from the common kind only by a somewhat more vigorous\r\ngrowth. Analogous results were obtained by the cultivation of another\r\nAmerican race, the “white-tooth corn,” in which the tooth nearly\r\ndisappeared even in the second generation. A third race, the\r\n“chicken-corn,” did not undergo so great a change, but the seeds became\r\nless polished and pellucid. In the above cases the seeds were carried\r\nfrom a warm to a colder climate. But Fritz Müller informs me that a\r\ndwarf variety with small rounded seeds (papa-gaien-mais), introduced\r\nfrom Germany into S. Brazil, produces plants as tall, with seeds as\r\nflat, as those of the kind commonly cultivated there.\r\n\r\nThese facts afford the most remarkable instance known to me of the\r\ndirect and prompt action of climate on a plant. It might have been\r\nexpected that the tallness of the stem, the period of vegetation, and\r\nthe ripening of the seed, would have been thus affected; but it is a\r\nmuch more surprising fact that the seeds should have undergone so rapid\r\nand great a change. As, however, flowers, with their product the seed,\r\nare formed by the metamorphosis of the stem and leaves, any\r\nmodification in these latter organs would be apt to extend, through\r\ncorrelation, to the organs of fructification.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage (Brassica oleracea)._—Every one knows how greatly the various\r\nkinds of cabbage differ in appearance. In the Island of Jersey, from\r\nthe effects of particular culture and of climate a stalk has grown to\r\nthe height of sixteen feet, and “had its spring shoots at the top\r\noccupied by a magpie’s nest:” the woody stems are not unfrequently from\r\nten to twelve feet in height, and are there used as rafters[64] and as\r\nwalking-sticks. We are thus reminded that in certain countries plants\r\nbelonging to the generally herbaceous order of the Cruciferæ are\r\ndeveloped into trees. Every one can appreciate the difference between\r\ngreen or red cabbages with great single heads; Brussel-sprouts with\r\nnumerous little heads; broccolis and cauliflowers with the greater\r\nnumber of their flowers in an aborted condition, incapable of producing\r\nseed, and borne in a dense corymb instead of an open panicle; savoys\r\nwith their blistered and wrinkled leaves; and borecoles and kails,\r\nwhich come nearest to the wild parent-form. There are also various\r\nfrizzled and laciniated kinds, some of such beautiful colours that\r\nVilmorin in his Catalogue of 1851 enumerates ten varieties which are\r\nvalued solely for ornament. Some kinds are less commonly known, such as\r\nthe Portuguese Couve Tronchuda, with the ribs of its leaves greatly\r\nthickened; and the Kohlrabi or choux-raves, with their stems enlarged\r\ninto great turnip-like masses above the ground; and the recently formed\r\nnew race[65] of the choux-raves, already including nine sub-varieties,\r\nin which the enlarged part lies beneath the ground like a turnip.\r\n\r\nAlthough we see such great differences in the shape, size, colour,\r\narrangement, and manner of growth of the leaves and stem, and of the\r\nflower-stems in the broccoli and cauliflower, it is remarkable that the\r\nflowers themselves, the seed-pods and seeds, present extremely slight\r\ndifferences or none at all.[66] I compared the flowers of all the\r\nprincipal kinds; those of the Couve Tronchuda are white and rather\r\nsmaller than in common cabbages; those of the Portsmouth broccoli have\r\nnarrower sepals, and smaller, less elongated petals; and in no other\r\ncabbage could any difference be detected. With respect to the\r\nseed-pods, in the purple Kohlrabi alone, do they differ, being a little\r\nlonger and narrower than usual. I made a collection of the seeds of\r\ntwenty-eight different kinds, and most of them were undistinguishable;\r\nwhen there was any difference it was excessively slight; thus, the\r\nseeds of various broccolis and cauliflowers, when seen in mass, are a\r\nlittle redder; those of the early green Ulm savoy are rather smaller;\r\nand those of the Breda kail slightly larger than usual, but not larger\r\nthan the seeds of the wild cabbage from the coast of Wales. What a\r\ncontrast in the amount of difference is presented if, on the one hand,\r\nwe compare the leaves and stems of the various kinds of cabbage with\r\ntheir flowers, pods, and seeds, and on the other hand the corresponding\r\nparts in the varieties of maize and wheat! The explanation is obvious;\r\nthe seeds alone are valued in our cereals, and their variations have\r\nbeen selected; whereas the seeds, seed-pods, and flowers, have been\r\nutterly neglected in the cabbage, whilst many useful variations in\r\ntheir leaves and stems have been noticed and preserved from an\r\nextremely remote period, for cabbages were cultivated by the old\r\nCelts.[67]\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to give a classified description[68] of the\r\nnumerous races, sub-races, and varieties of the cabbage; but it may be\r\nmentioned that Dr. Lindley has lately proposed[69] a system founded on\r\nthe state of development of the terminal and lateral leaf-buds. Thus:\r\nI. All the leaf-buds active and open, as in the wild-cabbage, kail,\r\netc. II. All the leaf-buds active, but forming heads, as in\r\nBrussel-sprouts, etc. III. Terminal leaf-bud alone active, forming a\r\nhead as in common cabbages, savoys, etc. IV. Terminal leaf-bud alone\r\nactive, and open, with most of the flowers abortive and succulent, as\r\nin the cauliflower and broccoli. V. All the leaf-buds active and open,\r\nwith most of the flowers abortive and succulent, as in the\r\nsprouting-broccoli. This latter variety is a new one, and bears the\r\nsame relation to common broccoli, as Brussel-sprouts do to common\r\ncabbages; it suddenly appeared in a bed of common broccoli, and was\r\nfound faithfully to transmit its newly-acquired and remarkable\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThe principal kinds of cabbage existed at least as early as the\r\nsixteenth century,[70] so that numerous modifications of structure have\r\nbeen inherited for a long period. This fact is the more remarkable as\r\ngreat care must be taken to prevent the crossing of the different\r\nkinds. To give proof of this: I raised 233 seedlings from cabbages of\r\ndifferent kinds, which had purposely been planted near each other, and\r\nof the seedlings no less than 155 were plainly deteriorated and\r\nmongrelised; nor were the remaining 78 all perfectly true. It may be\r\ndoubted whether many permanent varieties have been formed by\r\nintentional or accidental crosses; for such crossed plants are found to\r\nbe very inconstant. One kind, however, called “Cottager’s Kail,” has\r\nlately been produced by crossing common kail and Brussel-sprouts,\r\nrecrossed with purple broccoli,[71] and is said to be true; but plants\r\nraised by me were not nearly so constant in character as any common\r\nkind of cabbage.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the kinds keep true if carefully preserved from\r\ncrossing, yet the seed-beds must be yearly examined, and a few\r\nseedlings are generally found false; but even in this case the force of\r\ninheritance is shown, for, as Metzger has remarked[72] when speaking of\r\nBrussel-sprouts, the variations generally keep to their “unter art,” or\r\nmain race. But in order that any kind may be truly propagated there\r\nmust be no great change in the conditions of life; thus cabbages will\r\nnot form heads in hot countries, and the same thing has been observed\r\nwith an English variety grown during an extremely warm and damp autumn\r\nnear Paris.[73] Extremely poor soil also affects the characters of\r\ncertain varieties.\r\n\r\nMost authors believe that all the races are descended from the wild\r\ncabbage found on the western shores of Europe; but Alph. De\r\nCandolle[74] forcibly argues, on historical and other grounds, that it\r\nis more probable that two or three closely allied forms, generally\r\nranked as distinct species, still living in the Mediterranean region,\r\nare the parents, now all commingled together, of the various cultivated\r\nkinds. In the same manner as we have often seen with domesticated\r\nanimals, the supposed multiple origin of the cabbage throws no light on\r\nthe characteristic differences between the cultivated forms. If our\r\ncabbages are the descendants of three or four distinct species, every\r\ntrace of any sterility which may originally have existed between them\r\nis now lost, for none of the varieties can be kept distinct without\r\nscrupulous care to prevent intercrossing.\r\n\r\nThe other cultivated forms of the genus Brassica are descended,\r\naccording to the view adopted by Godron and Metzger,[75] from two\r\nspecies, _B. napus_ and _rapa_; but according to other botanists from\r\nthree species; whilst others again strongly suspect that all these\r\nforms, both wild and cultivated, ought to be ranked as a single\r\nspecies. _Brassica napus_ has given rise to two large groups, namely,\r\nSwedish turnips (believed to be of hybrid origin)[76] and Colzas, the\r\nseeds of which yield oil. _Brassica rapa_ (of Koch) has also given rise\r\nto two races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving rape. The\r\nevidence is unusually clear that these latter plants, though so\r\ndifferent in external appearance, belong to the same species; for the\r\nturnip has been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots in\r\nuncultivated soil; and when rape and turnips are sown together they\r\ncross to such a degree that scarcely a single plant comes true.[77]\r\nMetzger by culture converted the biennial or winter rape into the\r\nannual or summer rape,—varieties which have been thought by some\r\nauthors to be specifically distinct.[78]\r\n\r\nIn the production of large, fleshy, turnip-like stems, we have a case\r\nof analogous variation in three forms which are generally considered as\r\ndistinct species. But scarcely any modification seems so easily\r\nacquired as a succulent enlargement of the stem or root—that is, a\r\nstore of nutriment laid up for the plant’s own future use. We see this\r\nin our radishes, beet, and in the less generally known “turnip-rooted”\r\ncelery, and in the finocchio, or Italian variety of the common fennel.\r\nMr. Buckman has lately proved by his interesting experiments bow\r\nquickly the roots of the wild parsnip can be enlarged, as Vilmorin\r\nformerly proved in the case of the carrot.[79]\r\n\r\nThis latter plant, in its cultivated state, differs in scarcely any\r\ncharacter from the wild English carrot, except in general luxuriance\r\nand in the size and quality of its roots; but ten varieties, differing\r\nin the colour, shape, and quality of the root, are cultivated in\r\nEngland and come true by seed.[80] Hence with the carrot, as in so many\r\nother cases, for instance with the numerous varieties and sub-varieties\r\nof the radish, that part of the plant which is valued by man, falsely\r\nappears alone to have varied. The truth is that variations in this part\r\nalone have been selected; and the seedlings inheriting a tendency to\r\nvary in the same way, analogous modifications have been again and again\r\nselected, until at last a great amount of change has been effected.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the radish, M. Carrière, by sowing the seed of the wild\r\n_Raphanus raphanistrum_ in rich soil, and by continued selection during\r\nseveral generations, raised many varieties, closely like the cultivated\r\nradish (_R. sativus_) in their roots, as well as the wonderful Chinese\r\nvariety, _R. caudatus_: (see ‘Journal d’Agriculture pratique,’ tom. i,\r\n1869, p. 159; also a separate essay ‘Origine des Plantes Domestiques,’\r\n1869.) _Raphanus raphanistrum_ and _sativus_ have often been ranked as\r\ndistinct species, and owing to differences in their fruit even as\r\ndistinct genera; but Professor Hoffman (‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1872, p. 482)\r\nhas now shown that these differences, remarkable as they are, graduate\r\naway, the fruit of _R. caudatus_ being intermediate. By cultivating _R.\r\nraphanistrum_ during several generations (ibid., 1873, p. 9), Professor\r\nHoffman also obtained plants bearing fruits like those of _R. sativus._\r\n\r\n_Pea (Pisum sativum)._—Most botanists look at the garden-pea as\r\nspecifically distinct from the field-pea (_P. arvense_). The latter\r\nexists in a wild state in Southern Europe; but the aboriginal parent of\r\nthe garden-pea has been found by one collector alone, as he states, in\r\nthe Crimea.[81] Andrew Knight crossed, as I am informed by the Rev. A.\r\nFitch, the field-pea with a well-known garden variety, the Prussian\r\npea, and the cross seems to have been perfectly fertile. Dr. Alefield\r\nhas recently studied[82] the genus with care, and, after having\r\ncultivated about fifty varieties, concludes that certainly they all\r\nbelong to the same species. It is an interesting fact already alluded\r\nto, that, according to O. Heer,[83] the peas found in the\r\nlake-habitations of Switzerland of the Stone and Bronze ages, belong to\r\nan extinct variety, with exceedingly small seeds, allied to _P.\r\narvense_ or the field-pea. The varieties of the common garden-pea are\r\nnumerous, and differ considerably from one another. For comparison I\r\nplanted at the same time forty-one, English and French varieties. They\r\ndiffered greatly in height,— namely from between 6 and 12 inches to 8\r\nfeet,[84]—in manner of growth, and in period of maturity. Some differ\r\nin general aspect even while only two or three inches in height. The\r\nstems of the _Prussian_ pea are much branched. The tall kinds have\r\nlarger leaves than the dwarf kinds, but not in strict proportion to\r\ntheir height:—_Hair’s Dwarf Monmouth_ has very large leaves, and the\r\n_Pois nain hatif,_ and the moderately tall _ Blue Prussian,_ have\r\nleaves about two-thirds of the size of the tallest kind. In the\r\n_Danecroft_ the leaflets are rather small and a little pointed; in the\r\n_Queen of Dwarfs_ rather rounded; and in the _Queen of England_ broad\r\nand large. In these three peas the slight differences in the shape of\r\nthe leaves are accompanied by slight differences in colour, in the\r\n_Pois géant sans parchemin,_ which bears purple flowers, the leaflets\r\nin the young plant are edged with red; and in all the peas with purple\r\nflowers the stipules are marked with red.\r\n\r\nIn the different varieties, one, two, or several flowers in a small\r\ncluster, are borne on the same peduncle; and this is a difference which\r\nis considered of specific value in some of the Leguminosæ. In all the\r\nvarieties the flowers closely resemble each other except in colour and\r\nsize. They are generally white, sometimes purple, but the colour is\r\ninconstant even in the same variety. In _Warner’s Emperor,_ which is a\r\ntall kind, the flowers are nearly double the size of the _Pois nain\r\nhatif_; but _Hair’s Dwarf Monmouth,_ which has large leaves, likewise\r\nhas large flowers. The calyx in the _Victoria Marrow_ is large, and in\r\n_Bishop’s Long Pod_ the sepals are rather narrow. In no other kind is\r\nthere any difference in the flower.\r\n\r\nThe pods and seeds, which with natural species afford such constant\r\ncharacters, differ greatly in the cultivated varieties of the pea; and\r\nthese are the valuable, and consequently the selected parts. _Sugar\r\npeas,_ or _P_, are remarkable from their thin pods, which, whilst\r\nyoung, are cooked and eaten whole; and in this group, which, according\r\nto Mr. Gordon includes eleven sub-varieties, it is the pod which\r\ndiffers most; thus _Lewis’s Negro-podded pea_ has a straight, broad,\r\nsmooth, and dark-purple pod, with the husk not so thin as in the other\r\nkinds; the pod of another variety is extremely bowed; that of the _Pois\r\ngéant_ is much pointed at the extremity; and in the variety “à grands\r\ncosses” the peas are seen through the husk in so conspicuous a manner\r\nthat the pod, especially when dry, can hardly at first be recognised as\r\nthat of a pea.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary varieties the pods also differ much in size;—in colour,\r\nthat of _Woodford’s Green Marrow_ being bright-green when dry, instead\r\nof pale brown, and that of the purple-podded pea being expressed by its\r\nname;—in smoothness, that of _Danecroft_ being remarkably glossy,\r\nwhereas that of the _Ne plus ultra_ is rugged; in being either nearly\r\ncylindrical, or broad and flat;—in being pointed at the end, as in\r\n_Thurston’s Reliance,_ or much truncated, as in the _American Dwarf._\r\nIn the _Auvergne pea_ the whole end of the pod is bowed upwards. In the\r\n_Queen of the Dwarfs_ and in _Scimitar peas_ the pod is almost elliptic\r\nin shape. I here give drawings of the four most distinct pods produced\r\nby the plants cultivated by me.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig. 41.—Pods of the Common Pea\r\n\r\nIn the pea itself we have every tint between almost pure white, brown,\r\nyellow, and intense green; in the varieties of the _Sugar peas_ we have\r\nthese same tints, together with red passing through fine purple into a\r\ndark chocolate tint. These colours are either uniform or distributed in\r\ndots, striæ, or moss-like marks; they depend in some cases on the\r\ncolour of the cotyledons seen through the skin, and in other cases on\r\nthe outer coats of the pea itself. In the different varieties, the pods\r\ncontain, according to Mr. Gordon, from eleven or twelve to only four or\r\nfive peas. The largest peas are nearly twice as much in diameter as the\r\nsmallest; and the latter are not always borne by the most dwarfed\r\nkinds. Peas differ much in shape, being smooth and spherical, smooth\r\nand oblong, nearly oval in the _Queen of the Dwarfs,_ and nearly\r\ncubical and crumpled in many of the larger kinds.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the value of the differences between the chief\r\nvarieties, it cannot be doubted that, if one of the tall _Sugar-peas,_\r\nwith purple flowers, thin-skinned pods of an extraordinary shape,\r\nincluding large, dark-purple peas, grew wild by the side of the lowly\r\n_Queen of the Dwarfs,_ with white flowers, greyish-green, rounded\r\nleaves, scimitar-like pods, containing oblong, smooth, pale-coloured\r\npeas, which became mature at a different season: or by the side of one\r\nof the gigantic sorts, like the _Champion of England,_ with leaves of\r\ngreat size, pointed pods, and large, green, crumpled, almost cubical\r\npeas,—all three kinds would be ranked as distinct species.\r\n\r\nAndrew Knight[85] has observed that the varieties of peas keep very\r\ntrue, because they are not crossed by insects. As far as the fact of\r\nkeeping true is concerned, I hear from Mr. Masters of Canterbury, well\r\nknown as the originator of several new kinds, that certain varieties\r\nhave remained constant for a considerable time,—for instance, _Knight’s\r\nBlue Dwarf,_ which came out about the year 1820.[86] But the greater\r\nnumber of varieties have a singularly short existence: thus Loudon\r\nremarks[87] that “sorts which were highly approved in 1821, are now, in\r\n1833, nowhere to be found;” and on comparing the lists of 1833 with\r\nthose of 1855, I find that nearly all the varieties have changed. Mr.\r\nMasters informs me that the nature of the soil causes some varieties to\r\nlose their character. As with other plants, certain varieties can be\r\npropagated truly, whilst others show a determined tendency to vary;\r\nthus two peas differing in shape, one round and the other wrinkled,\r\nwere found by Mr. Masters within the same pod, but the plants raised\r\nfrom the wrinkled kind always evinced a strong tendency to produce\r\nround peas. Mr. Masters also raised from a plant of another variety\r\nfour distinct sub-varieties, which bore blue and round, white and\r\nround, blue and wrinkled, and white and wrinkled peas; and although he\r\nsowed these four varieties separately during several successive years,\r\neach kind always reproduced all four kinds mixed together!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the varieties not naturally intercrossing, I have\r\nascertained that the pea, which in this respect differs from some other\r\nLeguminosæ, is perfectly fertile without the aid of insects. Yet I have\r\nseen humble-bees whilst sucking the nectar depress the keel-petals, and\r\nbecome so thickly dusted with pollen, that it could hardly fail to be\r\nleft on the stigma of the next flower which was visited. Nevertheless,\r\ndistinct varieties growing closely together rarely cross; and I have\r\nreason to believe that this is due to their stigmas being prematurely\r\nfertilised in this country by pollen from the same flower. The\r\nhorticulturists who raise seed-peas are thus enabled to plant distinct\r\nvarieties close together without any bad consequences; and it is\r\ncertain, as I have myself found, that true seed may be saved during at\r\nleast several generations under these circumstances.[88] Mr. Fitch\r\nraised, as he informs me, one variety for twenty years, and it always\r\ncame true, though grown close to other varieties. From the analogy of\r\nkidney-beans I should have expected[89] that varieties thus\r\ncircumstanced would have occasionally crossed; and I shall give in the\r\neleventh chapter two cases of this having occurred, as shown (in a\r\nmanner hereafter to be explained) by the pollen of the one variety\r\nhaving acted directly on the seeds of the other. Whether many of the\r\nnew varieties which incessantly appear are due to such occasional and\r\naccidental crosses, I do not know. Nor do I know whether the short\r\nexistence of almost all the numerous varieties is the result of mere\r\nchange of fashion, or of their having a weak constitution, from being\r\nthe product of long-continued self-fertilisation. It may, however, be\r\nnoticed that several of Andrew Knight’s varieties, which have endured\r\nlonger than most kinds, were raised towards the close of the last\r\ncentury by artificial crosses; some of them, I believe, were still\r\nvigorous in 1860; but now, in 1865, a writer, speaking[90] of Knight’s\r\nfour kinds of marrows, says, they have acquired a famous history, but\r\ntheir glory has departed.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Beans (_Faba vulgaris_), I will say but little. Dr.\r\nAlefield has given[91] short diagnostic characters of forty varieties.\r\nEveryone who has seen a collection must have been struck with the great\r\ndifference in shape, thickness, proportional length and breadth,\r\ncolour, and size which beans present. What a contrast between a Windsor\r\nand Horse-bean! As in the case of the pea, our existing varieties were\r\npreceded during the Bronze age in Switzerland[92] by a peculiar and now\r\nextinct variety producing very small beans.[93]\r\n\r\n_Potato (Solanum tuberosum)._—There is little doubt about the parentage\r\nof this plant; for the cultivated varieties differ extremely little in\r\ngeneral appearance from the wild species, which can be recognised in\r\nits native land at the first glance.[94] The varieties cultivated in\r\nBritain are numerous; thus Lawson[95] gives a description of 175 kinds.\r\nI planted eighteen kinds in adjoining rows; their stems and leaves\r\ndiffered but little, and in several cases there was as great a\r\ndifference between the individuals of the same variety as between the\r\ndifferent varieties. The flower varied in size, and in colour between\r\nwhite and purple, but in no other respect, except that in one kind the\r\nsepals were somewhat elongated. One strange variety has been described\r\nwhich always produces two sorts of flowers, the first double and\r\nsterile, the second single and fertile.[96] The fruit or berries also\r\ndiffer, but only in a slight degree.[97] The varieties are liable in\r\nvery different degree to the attack of the Colorado potato-beetle.[98]\r\n\r\nThe tubers, on the other hand, present a wonderful amount of diversity.\r\nThis fact accords with the principle that the valuable and selected\r\nparts of all cultivated productions present the greatest amount of\r\nmodification. They differ much in size and shape, being globular, oval,\r\nflattened, kidney-like, or cylindrical. One variety from Peru is\r\ndescribed[99] as being quite straight, and at least six inches in\r\nlength, though no thicker than a man’s finger. The eyes or buds differ\r\nin form, position, and colour. The manner in which the tubers are\r\narranged on the so-called roots or rhizomes is different; thus, in the\r\n_gurken-kartoffeln_ they form a pyramid with the apex downwards, and in\r\nanother variety they bury themselves deep in the ground. The roots\r\nthemselves run either near the surface or deep in the ground. The\r\ntubers also differ in smoothness and colour, being externally white,\r\nred, purple, or almost black, and internally white, yellow, or almost\r\nblack. They differ in flavour and quality, being either waxy or mealy;\r\nin their period of maturity, and in their capacity for long\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nAs with many other plants which have been long propagated by bulbs,\r\ntubers, cuttings, etc., by which means the same individual is exposed\r\nduring a length of time to diversified conditions, seedling potatoes\r\ngenerally display innumerable slight differences. Several varieties,\r\neven when propagated by tubers, are far from constant, as will be seen\r\nin the chapter on Bud-variation. Dr. Anderson[100] procured seed from\r\nan Irish purple potato, which grew far from any other kind, so that it\r\ncould not at least in this generation have been crossed, yet the many\r\nseedlings varied in almost every possible respect, so that “scarcely\r\ntwo plants were exactly alike.” Some of the plants which closely\r\nresembled each other above ground, produced extremely dissimilar\r\ntubers; and some tubers which externally could hardly be distinguished,\r\ndiffered widely in quality when cooked. Even in this case of extreme\r\nvariability, the parent-stock had some influence on the progeny, for\r\nthe greater number of the seedlings resembled in some degree the parent\r\nIrish potato. Kidney potatoes must be ranked amongst the most highly\r\ncultivated and artificial races; nevertheless their peculiarities can\r\noften be strictly propagated by seed. A great authority, Mr.\r\nRivers,[101] states that “seedlings from the ash-leaved kidney always\r\nbear a strong resemblance to their parent. Seedlings from the\r\nfluke-kidney are still more remarkable for their adherence to their\r\nparent stock, for, on closely observing a great number during two\r\nseasons, I have not been able to observe the least difference, either\r\nin earliness, productiveness, or in the size or shape of their tubers.”\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Géographie botanique raisonnée,’ 1855, pp. 810 to 991.\r\n\r\n [2] Review by Mr. Bentham in ‘Hort.

That the vine varies much when propagated by seed, we may\r\ninfer from the largely increased number of varieties since the earlier\r\nhistorical records. New hot-house varieties are produced almost every\r\nyear; for instance,[5] a golden-coloured variety has been recently\r\nraised in England from a black grape without the aid of a cross. Van\r\nMons[6] reared a multitude of varieties from the seed of one vine,\r\nwhich was completely separated from all others, so that there could\r\nnot, at least in this generation, have been any crossing, and the\r\nseedlings presented “les analogues de toutes les sortes,” and differed\r\nin almost every possible character both in the fruits and foliage.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated varieties are extremely numerous; Count Odart says that\r\nhe will not deny that there may exist throughout the world 700 or 800,\r\nperhaps even 1000 varieties, but not a third of these have any value.\r\nIn the catalogue of fruit cultivated in the Horticultural Gardens of\r\nLondon, published in 1842, 99 varieties are enumerated. Wherever the\r\ngrape is grown many varieties occur: Pallas describes 24 in the Crimea,\r\nand Burnes mentions 10 in Cabool. The classification of the varieties\r\nhas much perplexed writers, and Count Odart is reduced to a\r\ngeographical system; but I will not enter on this subject, nor on the\r\nmany and great differences between the varieties. I will merely specify\r\na few curious and trifling peculiarities, all taken from Odart’s highly\r\nesteemed work[7] for the sake of showing the diversified variability of\r\nthis plant. Simon has classed grapes into two main divisions, those\r\nwith downy leaves, and those with smooth leaves, but he admits that in\r\none variety, namely the Rebazo, the leaves are either smooth, or downy;\r\nand Odart (p. 70) states that some varieties have the nerves alone, and\r\nother varieties their young leaves, downy, whilst the old ones are\r\nsmooth. The Pedro-Ximenes grape (Odart, p. 397) presents a peculiarity\r\nby which it can be at once recognised amongst a host of other\r\nvarieties, namely, that when the fruit is nearly ripe the nerves of the\r\nleaves or even the whole surface becomes yellow. The Barbera d’Asti is\r\nwell marked by several characters (p. 426), amongst others, “by some of\r\nthe leaves, and it is always the lowest on the branches, suddenly\r\nbecoming of a dark red colour.” Several authors in classifying grapes\r\nhave founded their main divisions on the berries being either round or\r\noblong; and Odart admits the value of this character; yet there is one\r\nvariety, the Maccabeo (p. 71), which often produces small round, and\r\nlarge oblong, berries in the same bunch. Certain grapes called Nebbiolo\r\n(p. 429) present a constant character, sufficient for their\r\nrecognition, namely, “the slight adherence of that part of the pulp\r\nwhich surrounds the seeds to the rest of the berry, when cut through\r\ntransversely.” A Rhenish variety is mentioned (p. 228) which likes a\r\ndry soil; the fruit ripens well, but at the moment of maturity, if much\r\nrain falls, the berries are apt to rot; on the other hand, the fruit of\r\na Swiss variety (p. 243) is valued for well sustaining prolonged\r\nhumidity. This latter variety sprouts late in the spring, yet matures\r\nits fruit early; other varieties (page 362) have the fault of being too\r\nmuch excited by the April sun, and in consequence suffer from frost. A\r\nStyrian variety (p. 254) has brittle foot-stalks, so that the clusters\r\nof fruit are often blown off; this variety is said to be particularly\r\nattractive to wasps and bees. Other varieties have tough stalks, which\r\nresist the wind. Many other variable characters could be given, but the\r\nforegoing facts are sufficient to show in how many small structural and\r\nconstitutional details the vine varies. During the vine disease in\r\nFrance certain old groups of varieties[8] have suffered far more from\r\nmildew than others. Thus “the group of Chasselas, so rich in varieties,\r\ndid not afford a single fortunate exception;” certain other groups\r\nsuffered much less; the true old Burgundy, for instance, was\r\ncomparatively free from disease, and the Carminat likewise resisted the\r\nattack. The American vines, which belong to a distinct species,\r\nentirely escaped the disease in France; and we thus see that those\r\nEuropean varieties which best resist the disease must have acquired in\r\na slight degree the same constitutional peculiarities as the American\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_White Mulberry (Morus alba)._—I mention this plant because it has\r\nvaried in certain characters, namely, in the texture and quality of the\r\nleaves, fitting them to serve as food for the domesticated silkworm, in\r\na manner not observed with other plants; but this has arisen simply\r\nfrom such variations in the mulberry having been attended to, selected,\r\nand rendered more or less constant. M. de Quatrefages[9] briefly\r\ndescribes six kinds cultivated in one valley in France: of these the _\r\namourouso_ produces excellent leaves, but is rapidly being abandoned\r\nbecause it produces much fruit mingled with the leaves: the _antofino_\r\nyields deeply cut leaves of the finest quality, but not in great\r\nquantity: the _claro_ is much sought for because the leaves can be\r\neasily collected: lastly, the _roso_ bears strong hardy leaves,\r\nproduced in large quantity, but with the one inconvenience, that they\r\nare best adapted for the worms after their fourth moult. MM.\r\nJacquemet-Bonnefont, of Lyon, however, remark in their catalogue (1862)\r\nthat two sub-varieties have been confounded under the name of the roso,\r\none having leaves too thick for the caterpillars, the other being\r\nvaluable because the leaves can easily be gathered from the branches\r\nwithout the bark being torn.\r\n\r\nIn India the mulberry has also given rise to many varieties. The Indian\r\nform is thought by many botanists to be a distinct species; but as\r\nRoyle remarks,[10] “so many varieties have been produced by cultivation\r\nthat it is difficult to ascertain whether they all belong to one\r\nspecies;” they are, as he adds, nearly as numerous as those of the\r\nsilkworm.\r\n\r\n_The Orange Group._—We here meet with great confusion in the specific\r\ndistinction and parentage of the several kinds. Gallesio,[11] who\r\nalmost devoted his life-time to the subject, considers that there are\r\nfour species, namely, sweet and bitter oranges, lemons, and citrons,\r\neach of which has given rise to whole groups of varieties, monsters,\r\nand supposed hybrids. One high authority[12] believes that these four\r\nreputed species are all varieties of the wild _Citrus medica,_ but that\r\nthe shaddock (_Citrus decumana_), which is not known in a wild state,\r\nis a distinct species; though its distinctness is doubted by another\r\nwriter “of great authority on such matters,” namely, Dr. Buchanan\r\nHamilton. Alph. De Candolle,[13] on the other hand—and there cannot be\r\na more capable judge—advances what he considers sufficient evidence of\r\nthe orange (he doubts whether the bitter and sweet kinds are\r\nspecifically distinct), the lemon, and citron, having been found wild,\r\nand consequently that they are distinct. He mentions two other forms\r\ncultivated in Japan and Java, which he ranks undoubted species; he\r\nspeaks rather more doubtfully about the shaddock, which varies much,\r\nand has not been found wild; and finally he considers some forms, such\r\nas Adam’s apple and the bergamotte, as probably hybrids.\r\n\r\nI have briefly abstracted these opinions for the sake of showing those\r\nwho have never attended to such subjects, how perplexing they are. It\r\nwould, therefore, be useless for my purpose to give a sketch of the\r\nconspicuous differences between the several forms. Besides the\r\never-recurrent difficulty of determining whether forms found wild are\r\ntruly aboriginal or are escaped seedlings, many of the forms, which\r\nmust be ranked as varieties, transmit their characters almost perfectly\r\nby seed. Sweet and bitter oranges differ in no important respect except\r\nin the flavour of their fruit, but Gallesio[14] is most emphatic that\r\nboth kinds can be propagated by seed with absolute certainty.\r\nConsequently, in accordance with his simple rule, he classes them as\r\ndistinct species; as he does sweet and bitter almonds, the peach and\r\nnectarine, etc. He admits, however, that the soft-shelled pine-tree\r\nproduces not only soft-shelled but some hard-shelled seedlings, so that\r\na little greater force in the power of inheritance would, according to\r\nthis rule, raise a soft-shelled pine-tree into the dignity of an\r\naboriginally created species. The positive assertion made by\r\nMacfayden[15] that the pips of sweet oranges produced in Jamaica,\r\naccording to the nature of the soil in which they are sown, either\r\nsweet or bitter oranges, is probably an error; for M. Alph. De Candolle\r\ninforms me that since the publication of his great work he has received\r\naccounts from Guiana, the Antilles, and Mauritius, that in these\r\ncountries sweet oranges faithfully transmit their character. Gallesio\r\nfound that the willow-leafed and the Little China oranges reproduced\r\ntheir proper leaves and fruit; but the seedlings were not quite equal\r\nin merit to their parents. The red-fleshed orange, on the other hand,\r\nfails to reproduce itself. Gallesio also observed that the seeds of\r\nseveral other singular varieties all reproduced trees having a peculiar\r\nphysiognomy, partly resembling their parent-forms. I can adduce another\r\ncase: the myrtle leaved orange is ranked by all authors as a variety,\r\nbut is very distinct in general aspect: in my father’s greenhouse,\r\nduring many years, it rarely yielded any fruit, but at last produced\r\none; and a tree thus raised was identical with the parent-form.\r\n\r\nAnother and more serious difficulty in determining the rank of the\r\nseveral forms is that, according to Gallesio,[16] they largely\r\nintercross without artificial aid; thus he positively states that seeds\r\ntaken from lemon-trees (_C. lemonum_) growing mingled with the citron\r\n(_C. medica_), which is generally considered as a distinct species,\r\nproduced a graduated series of varieties between these two forms.\r\nAgain, an Adam’s apple was produced from the seed of a sweet orange,\r\nwhich grew close to lemons and citrons. But such facts hardly aid us in\r\ndetermining whether to rank these forms as species or varieties; for it\r\nis now known that undoubted species of Verbascum, Cistus, Primula,\r\nSalix, etc., frequently cross in a state of nature. If indeed it were\r\nproved that plants of the orange tribe raised from these crosses were\r\neven partially sterile, it would be a strong argument in favour of\r\ntheir rank as species. Gallesio asserts that this is the case; but he\r\ndoes not distinguish between sterility from hybridism and from the\r\neffects of culture; and he almost destroys the force of this statement\r\nby another[17] namely, that when he impregnated the flowers of the\r\ncommon orange with the pollen taken from undoubted _varieties_ of the\r\norange, monstrous fruits were produced, which included “little pulp,\r\nand had no seeds, or imperfect seeds.”\r\n\r\nIn this tribe of plants we meet with instances of two highly remarkable\r\nfacts in vegetable physiology: Gallesio[18] impregnated an orange with\r\npollen from a lemon, and the fruit borne on the mother tree had a\r\nraised stripe of peel like that of a lemon both in colour and taste,\r\nbut the pulp was like that of an orange and included only imperfect\r\nseeds. The possibility of pollen from one variety or species directly\r\naffecting the fruit produced by another variety of species, is a\r\nsubject which I shall fully discuss in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nThe second remarkable fact is, that two supposed hybrids[19] (for their\r\nhybrid nature was not ascertained), between an orange and either a\r\nlemon or citron, produced on the same tree leaves, flowers, and fruit\r\nof both pure parent-forms, as well as of a mixed or crossed nature. A\r\nbud taken from any one of the branches and grafted on another tree\r\nproduces either one of the pure kinds or a capricious tree reproducing\r\nthe three kinds. Whether the sweet lemon, which includes within the\r\nsame fruit segments of differently flavoured pulp,[20] is an analogous\r\ncase, I know not. But to this subject I shall have to recur.\r\n\r\nI will conclude by giving from A. Risso[21] a short account of a very\r\nsingular variety of the common orange. It is the “_citrus aurantium\r\nfructu variabili,_” which on the young shoots produces rounded-oval\r\nleaves spotted with yellow, borne on petioles with heart-shaped wings;\r\nwhen these leaves fall off, they are succeeded by longer and narrower\r\nleaves, with undulated margins, of a pale-green colour embroidered with\r\nyellow, borne on footstalks without wings. The fruit whilst young is\r\npear-shaped, yellow, longitudinally striated, and sweet; but as it\r\nripens, it becomes spherical, of a reddish-yellow, and bitter.\r\n\r\n_Peach and Nectarine (Amygdalus persica)._—The best authorities are\r\nnearly unanimous that the peach has never been found wild. It was\r\nintroduced from Persia into Europe a little before the Christian era,\r\nand at this period few varieties existed. Alph. De Candolle,[22] from\r\nthe fact of the peach not having spread from Persia at an earlier\r\nperiod, and from its not having pure Sanscrit or Hebrew names, believes\r\nthat it is not an aboriginal of Western Asia, but came from the _terra\r\nincognita_ of China. The supposition, however, that the peach is a\r\nmodified almond which acquired its present character at a comparatively\r\nlate period, would, I presume, account for these facts; on the same\r\nprinciple that the nectarine, the offspring of the peach, has few\r\nnative names, and became known in Europe at a still later period.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Peach and Almond Stones.\r\n\r\nAndrew Knight,[23] from finding that a seedling-tree, raised from a\r\nsweet almond fertilised by the pollen of a peach, yielded fruit quite\r\nlike that of a peach, suspected that the peach-tree is a modified\r\nalmond; and in this he has been followed by various authors.[24] A\r\nfirst-rate peach, almost globular in shape, formed of soft and sweet\r\npulp, surrounding a hard, much furrowed, and slightly flattened stone,\r\ncertainly differs greatly from an almond, with its soft, slightly\r\nfurrowed, much flattened, and elongated stone, protected by a tough,\r\ngreenish layer of bitter flesh. Mr. Bentham[25] has particularly called\r\nattention to the stone of the almond being so much more flattened than\r\nthat of the peach. But in the several varieties of the almond, the\r\nstone differs greatly in the degree to which it is compressed, in size,\r\nshape, strength, and in the depth of the furrows, as may be seen in\r\nfig. 42 (Nos. 4 to 8) of such kinds as I have been able to collect.\r\nWith peach-stones also (Nos. 1 to 3) the degree of compression and\r\nelongation is seen to vary; so that the stone of the Chinese\r\nHoney-peach (No. 3) is much more elongated and compressed than that of\r\nthe (No. 8) Smyrna almond. Mr. Rivers, of Sawbridgeworth, to whom I am\r\nindebted for some of the specimens above figured, and who has had such\r\ngreat horticultural experience, has called my attention to several\r\nvarieties which connect the almond and the peach. In France there is a\r\nvariety called the Peach-Almond, which Mr. Rivers formerly cultivated,\r\nand which is correctly described in a French catalogue as being oval\r\nand swollen, with the aspect of a peach, including a hard stone\r\nsurrounded by a fleshy covering, which is sometimes eatable.[26] A\r\nremarkable statement by M. Luizet has recently appeared in the ‘Revue\r\nHorticole,’[27] namely, that a Peach-almond, grafted on a peach, bore,\r\nduring 1863 and 1864 almonds alone, but in 1865 bore six peaches and no\r\nalmonds. M. Carriere, in commenting on this fact, cites the case of a\r\ndouble-flowered almond which, after producing during several years\r\nalmonds, suddenly bore for two years in succession spherical fleshy\r\npeach-like fruits, but in 1865 reverted to its former state and\r\nproduced large almonds.\r\n\r\nAgain, as I hear from Mr. Rivers, the double-flowering Chinese peaches\r\nresemble almonds in their manner of growth and in their flowers; the\r\nfruit is much elongated and flattened, with the flesh both bitter and\r\nsweet, but not uneatable, and it is said to be of better quality in\r\nChina. From this stage one small step leads us to such inferior peaches\r\nas are occasionally raised from seed. For instance, Mr. Rivers sowed a\r\nnumber of peach-stones imported from the United States, where they are\r\ncollected for raising stocks, and some of the trees raised by him\r\nproduced peaches which were very like almonds in appearance, being\r\nsmall and hard, with the pulp not softening till very late in the\r\nautumn. Van Mons[28] also states that he once raised from a peach-stone\r\na peach having the aspect of a wild tree, with fruit like that of the\r\nalmond. From inferior peaches, such as these just described, we may\r\npass by small transitions, through clingstones of poor quality, to our\r\nbest and most melting kinds. From this gradation, from the cases of\r\nsudden variation above recorded, and from the fact that the peach has\r\nnot been found wild, it seems to me by far the most probable view, that\r\nthe peach is the descendant of the almond, improved and modified in a\r\nmarvellous manner.\r\n\r\nOne fact, however, is opposed to this conclusion. A hybrid, raised by\r\nKnight from the sweet almond by the pollen of the peach, produced\r\nflowers with little or no pollen, yet bore fruit, having been\r\napparently fertilised by a neighbouring nectarine. Another hybrid, from\r\na sweet almond by the pollen of a nectarine, produced during the first\r\nthree years imperfect blossoms, but afterwards perfect flowers with an\r\nabundance of pollen. If this slight degree of sterility cannot be\r\naccounted for by the youth of the trees (and this often causes lessened\r\nfertility), or by the monstrous state of the flowers, or by the\r\nconditions to which the trees were exposed, these two cases would\r\nafford a good argument against the peach being the descendant of the\r\nalmond.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the peach has proceeded from the almond, it has\r\ncertainly given rise to nectarines, or smooth peaches, as they are\r\ncalled by the French. Most of the varieties, both of the peach and\r\nnectarine, reproduce themselves truly by seed. Gallesio[29] says he has\r\nverified this with respect to eight races of the peach. Mr. Rivers[30]\r\nhas given some striking instances from his own experience, and it is\r\nnotorious that good peaches are constantly raised in North America from\r\nseed. Many of the American sub-varieties come true or nearly true to\r\ntheir kind, such as the white-blossom, several of the yellow-fruited\r\nfreestone peaches, the blood clingstone, the heath, and the lemon\r\nclingstone. On the other hand, a clingstone peach has been known to\r\ngive rise to a freestone.[31] In England it has been noticed that\r\nseedlings inherit from their parents flowers of the same size and\r\ncolour. Some characters, however, contrary to what might have been\r\nexpected, often are not inherited; such as the presence and form of the\r\nglands on the leaves.[32] With respect to nectarines, both cling and\r\nfreestones are known in North America to reproduce themselves by\r\nseed.[33] In England the new white nectarine was a seedling of the old\r\nwhite, and Mr. Rivers[34] has recorded several similar cases. From this\r\nstrong tendency to inheritance, which both peach and nectarine trees\r\nexhibit,—from certain slight constitutional differences[35] in their\r\nnature,—and from the great difference in their fruit both in appearance\r\nand flavour, it is not surprising, notwithstanding that the trees\r\ndiffer in no other respects and cannot even be distinguished, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Rivers, whilst young, that they have been ranked by\r\nsome authors as specifically distinct. Gallesio does not doubt that\r\nthey are distinct; even Alph. De Candolle does not appear perfectly\r\nassured of their specific identity: and an eminent botanist has quite\r\nrecently[36] maintained that the nectarine “probably constitutes a\r\ndistinct species.”\r\n\r\nHence it may be worth while to give all the evidence on the origin of\r\nthe nectarine. The facts in themselves are curious, and will hereafter\r\nhave to be referred to when the important subject of bud-variation is\r\ndiscussed. It is asserted[37] that the Boston nectarine was produced\r\nfrom a peach-stone, and this nectarine reproduced itself by seed.[38]\r\nMr. Rivers states[39] that from stones of three distinct varieties of\r\nthe peach he raised three varieties of nectarine; and in one of these\r\ncases no nectarine grew near the parent peach-tree. In another instance\r\nMr. Rivers raised a nectarine from a peach, and in the succeeding\r\ngeneration another nectarine from this nectarine.[40] Other such\r\ninstances have been communicated to me, but they need not be given. Of\r\nthe converse case, namely, of nectarine-stones yielding peach-trees\r\n(both free and clingstones), we have six undoubted instances recorded\r\nby Mr. Rivers; and in two of these instances the parent nectarines had\r\nbeen seedlings from other nectarines.[41]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the more curious case of full-grown peach-trees\r\nsuddenly producing nectarines by bud-variation (or sports as they are\r\ncalled by gardeners), the evidence is superabundant; there is also good\r\nevidence of the same tree producing both peaches and nectarines, or\r\nhalf-and-half fruit; by this term I mean a fruit with the one-half a\r\nperfect peach, and the other half a perfect nectarine.\r\n\r\nPeter Collinson in 1741 recorded the first case of a peach-tree\r\nproducing a nectarine,[42] and in 1766 he added two other instances. In\r\nthe same work, the editor, Sir J. E. Smith, describes the more\r\nremarkable case of a tree in Norfolk which usually bore both perfect\r\nnectarines and perfect peaches; but during two seasons some of the\r\nfruit were half and half in nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Salisbury in 1808[43] records six other cases of peach-trees\r\nproducing nectarines. Three of the varieties are named; viz., the\r\nAlberge, Belle Chevreuse, and Royal George. This latter tree seldom\r\nfailed to produce both kinds of fruit. He gives another case of a\r\nhalf-and-half fruit.\r\n\r\nAt Radford in Devonshire[44] a clingstone peach, purchased as the\r\nChancellor, was planted in 1815, and in 1824, after having previously\r\nproduced peaches alone, bore on one branch twelve nectarines; in 1825\r\nthe same branch yielded twenty-six nectarines, and in 1826 thirty-six\r\nnectarines, together with eighteen peaches. One of the peaches was\r\nalmost as smooth on one side as a nectarine. The nectarines were as\r\ndark as, but smaller than, the Elruge.\r\n\r\nAt Beccles a Royal George peach[45] produced a fruit, “three parts of\r\nit being peach and one part nectarine, quite distinct in appearance as\r\nwell as in flavour.” The lines of division were longitudinal, as\r\nrepresented in the woodcut. A nectarine-tree grew five yards from this\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chapman states[46] that he has often seen in Virginia very\r\nold peach-trees bearing nectarines.\r\n\r\nA writer in the ‘Gardener’s Chronicle’ says that a peach tree planted\r\nfifteen years previously[47] produced this year a nectarine between two\r\npeaches; a nectarine-tree grew close by.\r\n\r\nIn 1844[48] a Vanguard peach-tree produced, in the midst of its\r\nordinary fruit, a single red Roman nectarine.\r\n\r\nMr. Calver is stated[49] to have raised in the United States a seedling\r\npeach which produced a mixed crop of both peaches and nectarines.\r\n\r\nNear Dorking[50] a branch of the Téton de Vénus peach, which reproduces\r\nitself truly by seed,[51] bore its own fruit “so remarkable for its\r\nprominent point, and a nectarine rather smaller but well formed and\r\nquite round.”\r\n\r\nThe previous cases all refer to peaches suddenly producing nectarines,\r\nbut at Carclew[52] the unique case occurred, of a nectarine-tree,\r\nraised twenty years before from seed and never grafted, producing a\r\nfruit half peach and half nectarine; subsequently bore a perfect peach.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the foregoing facts; we have excellent evidence of\r\npeach-stones producing nectarine-trees, and of nectarine-stones\r\nproducing peach-Trees,—of the same tree bearing peaches and\r\nnectarines,—of peach-trees suddenly producing by bud-variation\r\nnectarines (such nectarines reproducing nectarines by seed), as well as\r\nfruit in part nectarine and in part peach,—and, lastly, of one\r\nnectarine-tree first bearing half-and-half fruit, and subsequently true\r\npeaches. As the peach came into existence before the nectarine, it\r\nmight have been expected from the law of reversion that nectarines\r\nwould have given birth by bud-variation or by seed to peaches, oftener\r\nthan peaches to nectarines; but this is by no means the case.\r\n\r\nTwo explanations have been suggested to account for these conversions.\r\nFirst, that the parent trees have been in every case hybrids[53]\r\nbetween the peach and nectarine, and have reverted by bud-variation or\r\nby seed to one of their pure parent forms. This view in itself is not\r\nvery improbable; for the Mountaineer peach, which was raised by Knight\r\nfrom the red nutmeg-peach by pollen of the violette hâtive\r\nnectarine,[54] produces peaches, but these are said _sometimes_ to\r\npartake of the smoothness and flavour of the nectarine. But let it be\r\nobserved that in the previous list no less than six well-known\r\nvarieties and several unnamed varieties of the peach have once suddenly\r\nproduced perfect nectarines by bud variation: and it would be an\r\nextremely rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach, which\r\nhave been cultivated for years in many districts, and which show not a\r\nvestige of a mixed parentage, are, nevertheless, hybrids. A second\r\nexplanation is, that the fruit of the peach has been directly affected\r\nby the pollen of the nectarine: although this certainly is possible, it\r\ncannot here apply; for we have not a shadow of evidence that a branch\r\nwhich has borne fruit directly affected by foreign pollen is so\r\nprofoundly modified as afterwards to produce buds which continue to\r\nyield fruit of the new and modified form. Now it is known that when a\r\nbud on a peach-tree has once borne a nectarine the same branch has in\r\nseveral instances gone on during successive years producing nectarines.\r\nThe Carclew nectarine, on the other hand, first produced half-and-half\r\nfruit, and subsequently pure peaches. Hence we may confidently accept\r\nthe common view that the nectarine is a variety of the peach, which may\r\nbe produced either by bud-variation or from seed. In the following\r\nchapter many analogous cases of bud-variation will he given.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the peach and the nectarine run in parallel lines. In\r\nboth classes the kinds differ from each other in the flesh of the fruit\r\nbeing white, red, or yellow; in being clingstones or freestones; in the\r\nflowers being large or small, with certain other characteristic\r\ndifferences; and in the leaves being serrated without glands, or\r\ncrenated and furnished with globose or reniform glands.[55] We can\r\nhardly account for this parallelism by supposing that each variety of\r\nthe nectarine is descended from a corresponding variety of the peach;\r\nfor though our nectarines are certainly the descendants of several\r\nkinds of peaches, yet a large number are the descendants of other\r\nnectarines, and they vary so much when thus reproduced that we can\r\nscarcely admit the above explanation.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the peach have largely increased in number since the\r\nChristian era, when from two to five varieties were known;[56] and the\r\nnectarine was unknown. At the present time, besides many varieties said\r\nto exist in China, Downing describes, in the United States,\r\nseventy-nine native and imported varieties of the peach; and a few\r\nyears ago Lindley[57] enumerated one hundred and sixty-four varieties\r\nof the peach and nectarine grown in England. I have already indicated\r\nthe chief points of difference between the several varieties.\r\nNectarines, even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches, always\r\npossess their own peculiar flavour, and are smooth and small.\r\nClingstone and freestone peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh either\r\nfirmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ\r\nin the character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters\r\nbeing more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother\r\nthan in clingstones. In the various kinds the flowers differ not only\r\nin size, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped,\r\nmore imbricated, generally red in the centre and pale towards the\r\nmargin: whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is\r\nusually more darkly coloured. One variety has nearly white flowers. The\r\nleaves are more or less serrated, and are either destitute of glands,\r\nor have globose or reniform glands;[58] and some few peaches, such as\r\nthe Brugnen, bear on the same tree both globular and kidney-shaped\r\nglands.[59] According to Robertson[60] the trees with glandular leaves\r\nare liable to blister, but not in any great degree to mildew; whilst\r\nthe non-glandular trees are more subject to curl, to mildew, and to the\r\nattacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the period of their\r\nmaturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,—the latter\r\ncircumstance being especially attended to in the United States. Certain\r\nvarieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in hot-houses better\r\nthan other varieties. The flat-peach of China is the most remarkable of\r\nall the varieties; it is so much depressed towards the summit, that the\r\nstone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy\r\nlayer.[61] Another Chinese variety, called the Honey-peach, is\r\nremarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point; its leaves\r\nare glandless and widely dentate.[62] The Emperor of Russia peach is a\r\nthird singular variety, having deeply double-serrated leaves; the fruit\r\nis deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the other:\r\nit originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar leaves.[63]\r\n\r\nThe peach has also produced in China a small class of trees valued for\r\nornament, namely the double-flowered; of these, five varieties are now\r\nknown in England, varying from pure white, through rose, to intense\r\ncrimson.[64] One of these varieties, called the camellia-flowered,\r\nbears flowers above 2¼ inches in diameter, whilst those of the\r\nfruit-bearing kinds do not at most exceed 1¼ inch in diameter. The\r\nflowers of the double-flowered peaches have the singular property[65]\r\nof frequently producing double or treble fruit. Finally, there is good\r\nreason to believe that the peach is an almond profoundly modified; but\r\nwhatever its origin may have been, there can be no doubt that it has\r\nyielded during the last eighteen centuries many varieties, some of them\r\nstrongly characterised, belonging both to the nectarine and peach form.\r\n\r\n_Apricot (Prunus armeniaca)._—It is commonly admitted that this tree is\r\ndescended from a single species, now found wild in the Caucasian\r\nregion.[66] On this view the varieties deserve notice, because they\r\nillustrate differences supposed by some botanists to be of specific\r\nvalue in the almond and plum. The best monograph on the apricot is by\r\nMr. Thompson,[67] who describes seventeen varieties. We have seen that\r\npeaches and nectarines vary in a strictly parallel manner; and in the\r\napricot, which forms a closely allied genus, we again meet with\r\nvariations analogous to those of the peach, as well as to those of the\r\nplum. The varieties differ considerably in the shape of their leaves,\r\nwhich are either serrated or crenated, sometimes with ear-like\r\nappendages at their bases, and sometimes with glands on the petioles.\r\nThe flowers are generally alike, but are small in the Masculine. The\r\nfruit varies much in size, shape, and in having the suture little\r\npronounced or absent; in the skin being smooth, or downy, as in the\r\norange-apricot; and in the flesh clinging to the stone, as in the\r\nlast-mentioned kind, or in readily separating from it, as in the\r\nTurkey-apricot. In all these differences we see the closest analogy\r\nwith the varieties of the peach and nectarine. In the stone we have\r\nmore important differences, and these in the case of the plum have been\r\nesteemed of specific value: in some apricots the stone is almost\r\nspherical, in others much flattened, being either sharp in front or\r\nblunt at both ends, sometimes channelled along the back, or with a\r\nsharp ridge along both margins. In the Moorpark, and generally in the\r\nHemskirke, the stone presents a singular character in being perforated,\r\nwith a bundle of fibres passing through the perforation from end to\r\nend. The most constant and important character, according to Thompson,\r\nis whether the kernel is bitter or sweet: yet in this respect we have a\r\ngraduated difference, for the kernel is very bitter in Shipley’s\r\napricot; in the Hemskirke less bitter than in some other kinds;\r\nslightly bitter in the Royal; and “sweet like a hazel-nut” in the\r\nBreda, Angoumois, and others. In the case of the almond, bitterness has\r\nbeen thought by some high authorities to indicate specific difference.\r\n\r\nIn N. America the Roman apricot endures “cold and unfavourable\r\nsituations, where no other sort, except the Masculine, will succeed;\r\nand its blossoms bear quite a severe frost without injury.”[68]\r\nAccording to Mr. Rivers,[69] seedling apricots deviate but little from\r\nthe character of their race: in France the Alberge is constantly\r\nreproduced from seed with but little variation. In Ladakh, according to\r\nMoorcroft,[70] ten varieties of the apricot, very different from each\r\nother, are cultivated, and all are raised from seed, excepting one,\r\nwhich is budded.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Plum Stones.\r\n\r\n_Plums (Prunus insititia)._—Formerly the sloe, _P. spinosa,_ was\r\nthought to be the parent of all our plums; but now this honour is very\r\ncommonly accorded to _P. insititia_ or the bullace, which is found wild\r\nin the Caucasus and N.-Western India, and is naturalised in\r\nEngland.[71] It is not at all improbable, in accordance with some\r\nobservations made by Mr. Rivers,[72] that both these forms, which some\r\nbotanists rank as a single species, may be the parents of our\r\ndomesticated plums. Another supposed parent-form, the _P. domestica,_\r\nis said to be found wild in the region of the Caucasus. Godron\r\nremarks[73] that the cultivated varieties may be divided into two main\r\ngroups, which he supposes to be descended from two aboriginal stocks;\r\nnamely, those with oblong fruit and stones pointed at both ends, having\r\nnarrow separate petals and upright branches; and those with rounded\r\nfruit, with stones blunt at both ends, with rounded petals and\r\nspreading branches. From what we know of the variability of the flowers\r\nin the peach and of the diversified manner of growth in our various\r\nfruit-trees, it is difficult to lay much weight on these latter\r\ncharacters. With respect to the shape of the fruit, we have conclusive\r\nevidence that it is extremely variable: Downing[74] gives outlines of\r\nthe plums of two seedlings, namely, the red and imperial gages, raised\r\nfrom the greengage; and the fruit of both is more elongated than that\r\nof the greengage. The latter has a very blunt broad stone, whereas the\r\nstone of the imperial gage is “oval and pointed at both ends.” These\r\ntrees also differ in their manner of growth: “the greengage is a very\r\nshort-jointed, slow-growing tree, of spreading and rather dwarfish\r\nhabit;” whilst its offspring, the imperial gage, “grows freely and\r\nrises rapidly, and has long dark shoots.” The famous Washington plum\r\nbears a globular fruit, but its offspring, the emerald drop, is nearly\r\nas much elongated as the most elongated plum figured by Downing,\r\nnamely, Manning’s prune. I have made a small collection of the stones\r\nof twenty-five kinds, and they graduate in shape from the bluntest into\r\nthe sharpest kinds. As characters derived from seeds are generally of\r\nhigh systematic importance, I have thought it worth while to give\r\ndrawings of the most distinct kinds in my small collection; and they\r\nmay be seen to differ in a surprising manner in size, outline,\r\nthickness, prominence of the ridges, and state of surface. It deserves\r\nnotice that the shape of the stone is not always strictly correlated\r\nwith that of the fruit: thus the Washington plum is spherical and\r\ndepressed at the pole, with a somewhat elongated stone, whilst the\r\nfruit of the Goliath is more elongated, but the stone less so, than in\r\nthe Washington. Again, Denyer’s Victoria and Goliath bear fruit closely\r\nresembling each other, but their stones are widely different. On the\r\nother hand, the Harvest and Black Margate plums are very dissimilar,\r\nyet include closely similar stones.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the plum are numerous, and differ greatly in size,\r\nshape, quality, and colour,—being bright yellow, green, almost white,\r\nblue, purple, or red. There are some curious varieties, such as the\r\ndouble or Siamese, and the Stoneless plum: in the latter the kernel\r\nlies in a roomy cavity surrounded only by the pulp. The climate of\r\nNorth America appears to be singularly favourable for the production of\r\nnew and good varieties; Downing describes no less than forty, of which\r\nseven of first-rate quality have been recently introduced into\r\nEngland.[75] Varieties occasionally arise having an innate adaptation\r\nfor certain soils, almost as strongly pronounced as with natural\r\nspecies growing on the most distinct geological formations; thus in\r\nAmerica the imperial gage, differently from almost all other kinds, “is\r\npeculiarly fitted for _dry light_ soils where many sorts drop their\r\nfruit,” whereas on rich heavy soils the fruit is often insipid.[76] My\r\nfather could never succeed in making the Wine-Sour yield even a\r\nmoderate crop in a sandy orchard near Shrewsbury, whilst in some parts\r\nof the same county and in its native Yorkshire it bears abundantly: one\r\nof my relations also repeatedly tried in vain to grow this variety in a\r\nsandy district in Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nMr. Rivers has given[77] a number of interesting facts, showing how\r\ntruly many varieties can be propagated by seed. He sowed the stones of\r\ntwenty bushels of the greengage for the sake of raising stocks, and\r\nclosely observed the seedlings; all had the smooth shoots, the\r\nprominent buds, and the glossy leaves of the greengage, but the greater\r\nnumber had smaller leaves and thorns. There are two kinds of damson,\r\none the Shropshire with downy shoots, and the other the Kentish with\r\nsmooth shoots, and these differ but slightly in any other respect: Mr.\r\nRivers sowed some bushels of the Kentish damson, and all the seedlings\r\nhad smooth shoots, but in some the fruit was oval, in others round or\r\nroundish, and in a few the fruit was small, and, except in being sweet,\r\nclosely resembled that of the wild sloe. Mr. Rivers gives several other\r\nstriking instances of inheritance: thus, he raised eighty thousand\r\nseedlings from the common German Quetsche plum, and “not one could be\r\nfound varying in the least, in foliage or habit.” Similar facts were\r\nobserved with the Petite Mirabelle plum, yet this latter kind (as well\r\nas the Quetsche) is known to have yielded some well-established\r\nvarieties; but, as Mr. Rivers remarks, they all belong to the same\r\ngroup with the Mirabelle.\r\n\r\n_Cherries (Prunus cerasus, avium, etc.)._—Botanists believe that our\r\ncultivated cherries are descended from one, two, four, or even more\r\nwild stocks.[78] That there must be at least two parent species we may\r\ninfer from the sterility of twenty hybrids raised by Mr. Knight from\r\nthe morello fertilised by pollen of the Elton cherry; for these hybrids\r\nproduced in all only five cherries, and one alone of these contained a\r\nseed.[79] Mr. Thompson[80] has classified the varieties in an\r\napparently natural method in two main groups by characters taken from\r\nthe flowers, fruit, and leaves; but some varieties which stand widely\r\nseparate in this classification are quite fertile when crossed; thus\r\nKnight’s Early Black cherries are the product of a cross between two\r\nsuch kinds.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight states that seedling cherries are more variable than those\r\nof any other fruit-tree.[81] In the Catalogue of the Horticultural\r\nSociety for 1842 eighty varieties are enumerated. Some varieties\r\npresent singular characters: thus, the flower of the Cluster cherry\r\nincludes as many as twelve pistils, of which the majority abort; and\r\nthey are said generally to produce from two to five or six cherries\r\naggregated together and borne on a single peduncle. In the Ratafia\r\ncherry several flower-peduncles arise from a common peduncle, upwards\r\nof an inch in length. The fruit of Gascoigne’s Heart has its apex\r\nproduced into a globule or drop; that of the white Hungarian Gean has\r\nalmost transparent flesh. The Flemish cherry is “a very odd-looking\r\nfruit,” much flattened at the summit and base, with the latter deeply\r\nfurrowed, and borne on a stout, very short footstalk. In the Kentish\r\ncherry the stone adheres so firmly to the footstalk, that it could be\r\ndrawn out of the flesh; and this renders the fruit well fitted for\r\ndrying. The Tobacco-leaved cherry, according to Sageret and Thompson,\r\nproduces gigantic leaves, more than a foot and sometimes even eighteen\r\ninches in length, and half a foot in breadth. The weeping cherry, on\r\nthe other hand, is valuable only as an ornament, and, according to\r\nDowning, is “a charming little tree, with slender, weeping branches,\r\nclothed with small, almost myrtle-like foliage.” There is also a\r\npeach-leaved variety.\r\n\r\nSageret describes a remarkable variety, _le griottier de la Toussaint,_\r\nwhich bears at the same time, even as late as September, flowers and\r\nfruit of all degrees of maturity. The fruit, which is of inferior\r\nquality, is borne on long, very thin footstalks. But the extraordinary\r\nstatement is made that all the leaf-bearing shoots spring from old\r\nflower-buds. Lastly, there is an important physiological distinction\r\nbetween those kinds of cherries which bear fruit on young or on old\r\nwood; but Sageret positively asserts that a Bigarreau in his garden\r\nbore fruit on wood of both ages.[82]\r\n\r\n_Apple (Pyrus malus)._—The one source of doubt felt by botanists with\r\nrespect to the parentage of the apple is whether, besides _P. malus,_\r\ntwo or three other closely allied wild forms, namely, _P. acerba_ and _\r\npræcox_ or _paradisiaca,_ do not deserve to be ranked as distinct\r\nspecies. The _P. præcox_ is supposed by some authors[83] to be the\r\nparent of the dwarf paradise stock, which, owing to the fibrous roots\r\nnot penetrating deeply into the ground, is so largely used for\r\ngrafting; but the paradise stocks, it is asserted,[84] cannot be\r\npropagated true by seed. The common wild crab varies considerably in\r\nEngland; but many of the varieties are believed to be escaped\r\nseedlings.[85] Every one knows the great difference in the manner of\r\ngrowth, in the foliage, flowers, and especially in the fruit, between\r\nthe almost innumerable varieties of the apple. The pips or seeds (as I\r\nknow by comparison) likewise differ considerably in shape, size, and\r\ncolour. The fruit is adapted for eating or for cooking in various ways,\r\nand keeps for only a few weeks or for nearly two years. Some few kinds\r\nhave the fruit covered with a powdery secretion, called bloom, like\r\nthat on plums; and “it is extremely remarkable that this occurs almost\r\nexclusively among varieties cultivated in Russia.”[86] Another Russian\r\napple, the white Astracan, possesses the singular property of becoming\r\ntransparent, when ripe, like some sorts of crabs. The _api étoilé_ has\r\nfive prominent ridges, hence its name; the _api noir_ is nearly black:\r\nthe _twin cluster pippin_ often bears fruit joined in pairs.[87] The\r\ntrees of the several sorts differ greatly in their periods of leafing\r\nand flowering; in my orchard the _Court Pendu Plat_ produces leaves so\r\nlate, that during several springs I thought that it was dead. The\r\nTiffin apple scarcely bears a leaf when in full bloom; the Cornish\r\ncrab, on the other hand, bears so many leaves at this period that the\r\nflowers can hardly be seen.[88] In some kinds the fruit ripens in\r\nmid-summer; in others, late in the autumn. These several differences in\r\nleafing, flowering, and fruiting, are not at all necessarily\r\ncorrelated; for, as Andrew Knight has remarked,[89] no one can judge\r\nfrom the early flowering of a new seedling, or from the early shedding\r\nor change of colour of the leaves, whether it will mature its fruit\r\nearly in the season.\r\n\r\nThe varieties differ greatly in constitution. It is notorious that our\r\nsummers are not hot enough for the Newtown Pippin,[90] which is the\r\nglory of the orchards near New York; and so it is with several\r\nvarieties which we have imported from the Continent. On the other hand,\r\nour Court of Wick succeeds well under the severe climate of Canada. The\r\n_Caville rouge de Micoud_ occasionally bears two crops during the same\r\nyear. The Burr Knot is covered with small excrescences, which emit\r\nroots so readily that a branch with blossom-buds may be stuck in the\r\nground, and will root and bear a few fruit even during the first\r\nyear.[91] Mr. Rivers has recently described[92] some seedlings valuable\r\nfrom their roots running near the surface. One of these seedlings was\r\nremarkable from its extremely dwarfed size, “forming itself into a bush\r\nonly a few inches in height.” Many varieties are particularly liable to\r\ncanker in certain soils. But perhaps the strangest constitutional\r\npeculiarity is that the Winter Majetin is not attacked by the mealy bug\r\nor coccus; Lindley[93] states that in an orchard in Norfolk infested\r\nwith these insects the Majetin was quite free, though the stock on\r\nwhich it was grafted was affected: Knight makes a similar statement\r\nwith respect to a cider apple, and adds that he only once saw these\r\ninsects just above the stock, but that three days afterwards they\r\nentirely disappeared; this apple, however, was raised from a cross\r\nbetween the Golden Harvey and the Siberian Crab; and the latter, I\r\nbelieve, is considered by some authors as specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nThe famous St. Valery apple must not be passed over; the flower has a\r\ndouble calyx with ten divisions, and fourteen styles surmounted by\r\nconspicuous oblique stigmas, but is destitute of stamens or corolla.\r\nThe fruit is constricted round the middle, and is formed of five\r\nseed-cells, surmounted by nine other cells.[94] Not being provided with\r\nstamens, the tree requires artificial fertilisation; and the girls of\r\nSt. Valery annually go to “_faire ses pommes,_” each marking her own\r\nfruit with a ribbon; and as different pollen is used the fruit differs,\r\nand we here have an instance of the direct action of foreign pollen on\r\nthe mother plant. These monstrous apples include, as we have seen,\r\nfourteen seed-cells; the pigeon-apple,[95] on the other hand, has only\r\nfour, instead of, as with all common apples, five cells; and this\r\ncertainly is a remarkable difference.\r\n\r\nIn the catalogue of apples published in 1842 by the Horticultural\r\nSociety, 897 varieties are enumerated; but the differences between most\r\nof them are of comparatively little interest, as they are not strictly\r\ninherited. No one can raise, for instance, from the seed of the Ribston\r\nPippin, a tree of the same kind; and it is said that the “Sister\r\nRibston Pippin” was a white semi-transparent, sour-fleshed apple, or\r\nrather large crab.[96] Yet it was a mistake to suppose that with most\r\nvarieties the characters are not to a certain extent inherited. In two\r\nlots of seedlings raised from two well-marked kinds, many worthless\r\ncrab-like seedlings will appear, but it is now known that the two lots\r\nnot only usually differ from each other, but resemble to a certain\r\nextent their parents. We see this indeed in the several sub-groups of\r\nRussetts, Sweetings, Codlins, Pearmains, Reinettes, etc.,[97] which are\r\nall believed, and many are known, to be descended from other varieties\r\nbearing the same names.\r\n\r\n_Pears (Pyrus communis)._—I need say little on this fruit, which varies\r\nmuch in the wild state, and to an extraordinary degree when cultivated,\r\nin its fruit, flowers, and foliage. One of the most celebrated\r\nbotanists in Europe, M. Decaisne, has carefully studied the many\r\nvarieties;[98] although he formerly believed that they were derived\r\nfrom more than one species, he now thinks that all belong to one. He\r\nhas arrived at this conclusion from finding in the several varieties a\r\nperfect gradation between the most extreme characters; so perfect is\r\nthis gradation that he maintains it to be impossible to classify the\r\nvarieties by any natural method. M. Decaisne raised many seedlings from\r\nfour distinct kinds, and has carefully recorded the variations in each.\r\nNotwithstanding this extreme degree of variability, it is now\r\npositively known that many kinds reproduce by seed the leading\r\ncharacters of their race.[99]\r\n\r\n_Strawberries (Fragaria)._—This fruit is remarkable on account of the\r\nnumber of species which have been cultivated, and from their rapid\r\nimprovement within the last fifty or sixty years. Let any one compare\r\nthe fruit of one of the largest varieties exhibited at our Shows with\r\nthat of the wild wood strawberry, or, which will be a fairer\r\ncomparison, with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild American\r\nVirginian Strawberry, and he will see what prodigies horticulture has\r\neffected.[100] The number of varieties has likewise increased in a\r\nsurprisingly rapid manner. Only three kinds were known in France, in\r\n1746, where this fruit was early cultivated. In 1766 five species had\r\nbeen introduced, the same which are now cultivated, but only five\r\nvarieties of _Fragaria vesca,_ with some sub-varieties, had been\r\nproduced. At the present day the varieties of the several species are\r\nalmost innumerable. The species consist of, firstly, the wood or Alpine\r\ncultivated strawberries, descended from _F. vesca,_ a native of Europe\r\nand of North America. There are eight wild European varieties, as\r\nranked by Duchesne, of _F. vesca,_ but several of these are considered\r\nspecies by some botanists. Secondly, the green strawberries, descended\r\nfrom the European _F. collina,_ and little cultivated in England.\r\nThirdly, the Hautbois, from the European _F. elatior._ Fourthly, the\r\nScarlets, descended from _F. virginiana,_ a native of the whole breadth\r\nof North America. Fifthly, the Chili, descended from _F. chiloensis,_\r\nan inhabitant of the west coast of the temperate parts both of North\r\nand South America. Lastly, the pines or Carolinas (including the old\r\nBlacks), which have been ranked by most authors under the name of _F.\r\ngrandiflora_ as a distinct species, said to inhabit Surinam; but this\r\nis a manifest error. This form is considered by the highest authority,\r\nM. Gay, to be merely a strongly marked race of _F. chiloensis._[101]\r\nThese five or six forms have been ranked by most botanists as\r\nspecifically distinct; but this may be doubted, for Andrew Knight,[102]\r\nwho raised no less than 400 crossed strawberries, asserts that the _ F.\r\nvirginiana, chiloensis_ and _grandiflora_ “may be made to breed\r\ntogether indiscriminately,” and he found, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of analogous variation, “that similar varieties could be\r\nobtained from the seeds of any one of them.”\r\n\r\nSince Knight’s time there is abundant and additional evidence[103] of\r\nthe extent to which the American forms spontaneously cross. We owe\r\nindeed to such crosses most of our choicest existing varieties. Knight\r\ndid not succeed in crossing the European wood-strawberry with the\r\nAmerican Scarlet or with the Hautbois. Mr. Williams of Pitmaston,\r\nhowever, succeeded; but the hybrid offspring from the Hautbois, though\r\nfruiting well, never produced seed, with the exception of a single one,\r\nwhich reproduced the parent hybrid form.[104] Major R. Trevor Clarke\r\ninforms me that he crossed two members of the Pine class (Myatt’s B.\r\nQueen and Keen’s Seedling) with the wood and hautbois, and that in each\r\ncase he raised only a single seedling; one of these fruited, but was\r\nalmost barren. Mr. W. Smith, of York, has raised similar hybrids with\r\nequally poor success.[105] We thus see[106] that the European and\r\nAmerican species can with some difficulty be crossed; but it is\r\nimprobable that hybrids sufficiently fertile to be worth cultivation\r\nwill ever be thus produced. This fact is surprising, as these forms\r\nstructurally are not widely distinct, and are sometimes connected in\r\nthe districts where they grow wild, as I hear from Professor Asa Gray,\r\nby puzzling intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nThe energetic culture of the Strawberry is of recent date, and the\r\ncultivated varieties can in most cases be classed under some one of the\r\nabove native stocks. As the American strawberries cross so freely and\r\nspontaneously, we can hardly doubt that they will ultimately become\r\ninextricably confused. We find, indeed, that horticulturists at present\r\ndisagree under which class to rank some few of the varieties; and a\r\nwriter in the ‘Bon Jardinier’ of 1840 remarks that formerly it was\r\npossible to class all of them under some one species, but that now this\r\nis quite impossible with the American forms, the new English varieties\r\nhaving completely filled up the gaps between them.[107] The blending\r\ntogether of two or more aboriginal forms, which there is every reason\r\nto believe has occurred with some of our anciently cultivated\r\nproductions, we see now actually occurring with our strawberries.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated species offer some variations worth notice. The Black\r\nPrince, a seedling from Keen’s Imperial (this latter being a seedling\r\nof a very white strawberry, the white Carolina), is remarkable from\r\n“its peculiar dark and polished surface, and from presenting an\r\nappearance entirely unlike that of any other kind.”[108] Although the\r\nfruit in the different varieties differs so greatly in form, size,\r\ncolour, and quality, the so-called seed (which corresponds with the\r\nwhole fruit in the plum) with the exception of being more or less\r\ndeeply embedded in the pulp, is, according to De Jonghe,[109]\r\nabsolutely the same in all: and this no doubt may be accounted for by\r\nthe seed being of no value, and consequently not having been subjected\r\nto selection. The strawberry is properly three-leaved, but in 1761\r\nDuchesne raised a single-leaved variety of the European\r\nwood-strawberry, which Linnæus doubtfully raised to the rank of a\r\nspecies. Seedlings of this variety, like those of most varieties not\r\nfixed by long-continued selection, often revert to the ordinary form,\r\nor present intermediate states.[110] A variety raised by Mr.\r\nMyatt,[111] apparently belonging to one of the American forms presents\r\na variation of an opposite nature, for it has five leaves; Godron and\r\nLambertye also mention a five-leaved variety of _F. collina._\r\n\r\nThe Red Bush Alpine strawberry (one of the _F. vesca_ section) does not\r\nproduce stolons or runners, and this remarkable deviation of structure\r\nis reproduced truly by seed. Another sub-variety, the White Bush\r\nAlpine, is similarly characterised, but when propagated by seed it\r\noften degenerates and produces plants with runners.[112] A strawberry\r\nof the American Pine section is also said to make but few runners.[113]\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the sexes of strawberries; the true Hautbois\r\nproperly bears the male and female organs on separate plants,[114] and\r\nwas consequently named by Duchesne _dioica_; but it frequently produces\r\nhermaphrodites; and Lindley,[115] by propagating such plants by\r\nrunners, at the same time destroying the males, soon raised a\r\nself-prolific stock. The other species often showed a tendency towards\r\nan imperfect separation of the sexes, as I have noticed with plants\r\nforced in a hot-house. Several English varieties, which in this country\r\nare free from any such tendency, when cultivated in rich soils under\r\nthe climate of North America[116] commonly produce plants with separate\r\nsexes. Thus a whole acre of Keen’s Seedlings in the United States has\r\nbeen observed to be almost sterile from the absence of male flowers;\r\nbut the more general rule is, that the male plants overrun the females.\r\nSome members of the Cincinnati Horticultural Society, especially\r\nappointed to investigate this subject, report that “few varieties have\r\nthe flowers perfect in both sexual organs,” etc. The most successful\r\ncultivators in Ohio plant for every seven rows of “pistillata,” or\r\nfemale plants, one row of hermaphrodites, which afford pollen for both\r\nkinds; but the hermaphrodites, owing to their expenditure in the\r\nproduction of pollen, bear less fruit than the female plants.\r\n\r\nThe varieties differ in constitution. Some of our best English kinds,\r\nsuch as Keen’s Seedlings, are too tender for certain parts of North\r\nAmerica, where other English and many American varieties succeed\r\nperfectly. That splendid fruit, the British Queen, can be cultivated\r\nbut in few places either in England or France: but this apparently\r\ndepends more on the nature of the soil than on the climate; a famous\r\ngardener says that “no mortal could grow the British Queen at Shrubland\r\nPark unless the whole nature of the soil was altered.”[117] La\r\nConstantine is one of the hardiest kinds, and can withstand Russian\r\nwinters, but it is easily burnt by the sun, so that it will not succeed\r\nin certain soils either in England or the United States.[118] The\r\nFilbert Pine Strawberry “requires more water than any other variety;\r\nand if the plants once suffer from drought, they will do little or no\r\ngood afterwards.”[119] Cuthill’s Black Prince Strawberry evinces a\r\nsingular tendency to mildew; no less than six cases have been recorded\r\nof this variety suffering severely, whilst other varieties growing\r\nclose by, and treated in exactly the same manner, were not at all\r\ninfested by this fungus.[120] The time of maturity differs much in the\r\ndifferent varieties: some belonging to the wood or alpine section\r\nproduce a succession of crops throughout the summer.\r\n\r\n_Gooseberry (Ribes grossularia)._—No one, I believe, has hitherto\r\ndoubted that all the cultivated kinds are sprung from the wild plant\r\nbearing this name, which is common in Central and Northern Europe;\r\ntherefore it will be desirable briefly to specify all the points,\r\nthough not very important, which have varied. If it be admitted that\r\nthese differences are due to culture, authors perhaps will not be so\r\nready to assume the existence of a large number of unknown wild\r\nparent-stocks for our other cultivated plants. The gooseberry is not\r\nalluded to by writers of the classical period. Turner mentions it in\r\n1573, and Parkinson specifies eight varieties in 1629; the Catalogue of\r\nthe Horticultural Society for 1842 gives 149 varieties, and the lists\r\nof the Lancashire nurserymen are said to include above 300 names.[121]\r\nIn the ‘Gooseberry Grower’s Register’ for 1862 I find that 243 distinct\r\nvarieties have won prizes at various periods, so that a vast number\r\nmust have been exhibited. No doubt the difference between many of the\r\nvarieties is very small; but Mr. Thompson in classifying the fruit for\r\nthe Horticultural Society found less confusion in the nomenclature of\r\nthe gooseberry than of any other fruit, and he attributes this “to the\r\ngreat interest which the prize-growers have taken in detecting sorts\r\nwith wrong names,” and this shows that all the kinds, numerous as they\r\nare, can be recognised with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe bushes differ in their manner of growth, being erect, or spreading,\r\nor pendulous. The periods of leafing and flowering differ both\r\nabsolutely and relatively to each other; thus the Whitesmith produces\r\nearly flowers, which from not being protected by the foliage, as it is\r\nbelieved, continually fail to produce fruit.[122] The leaves vary in\r\nsize, tint, and in depth of lobes; they are smooth, downy, or hairy on\r\nthe upper surface. The branches are more or less downy or spinose; “the\r\nHedgehog has probably derived its name from the singular bristly\r\ncondition of its shoots and fruit.” The branches of the wild\r\ngooseberry, I may remark, are smooth, with the exception of thorns at\r\nthe bases of the buds. The thorns themselves are either very small, few\r\nand single, or very large and triple; they are sometimes reflexed and\r\nmuch dilated at their bases. In the different varieties the fruit\r\nvaries in abundance, in the period of maturity, in hanging until\r\nshrivelled, and greatly in size, “some sorts having their fruit large\r\nduring a very early period of growth, whilst others are small, until\r\nnearly ripe.” The fruit varies also much in colour, being red, yellow,\r\ngreen, and white—the pulp of one dark-red gooseberry being tinged with\r\nyellow; in flavour; in being smooth or downy,—few, however, of the Red\r\ngooseberries, whilst many of the so-called Whites, are downy; or in\r\nbeing so spinose that one kind is called Henderson’s Porcupine. Two\r\nkinds acquire when mature a powdery bloom on their fruit. The fruit\r\nvaries in the thickness and veining of the skin, and, lastly, in shape,\r\nbeing spherical, oblong, oval, or obovate.[123]\r\n\r\nI cultivated fifty-four varieties, and, considering how greatly the\r\nfruit differs, it was curious how closely similar the flowers were in\r\nall these kinds. In only a few I detected a trace of difference in the\r\nsize or colour of the corolla. The calyx differed in a rather greater\r\ndegree, for in some kinds it was much redder than in others; and in one\r\nsmooth white gooseberry it was unusually red. The calyx also differed\r\nin the basal part being smooth or woolly, or covered with glandular\r\nhairs. It deserves notice, as being contrary to what might have been\r\nexpected from the law of correlation, that a smooth red gooseberry had\r\na remarkably hairy calyx. The flowers of the Sportsman are furnished\r\nwith very large coloured bracteæ; and this is the most singular\r\ndeviation of structure which I have observed. These same flowers also\r\nvaried much in the number of the petals, and occasionally in the number\r\nof the stamens and pistils; so that they were semi-monstrous in\r\nstructure, yet they produced plenty of fruit. Mr. Thompson remarks that\r\nin the Pastime gooseberry “extra bracts are often attached to the sides\r\nof the fruit.”[124]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point in the history of the gooseberry is the\r\nsteady increase in the size of the fruit. Manchester is the metropolis\r\nof the fanciers, and prizes from five shillings to five or ten pounds\r\nare yearly given for the heaviest fruit. The ‘Gooseberry Growers\r\nRegister’ is published annually; the earliest known copy is dated 1786,\r\nbut it is certain that meetings for the adjudication of prizes were\r\nheld some years previously.[125] The ‘Register’ for 1845 gives an\r\naccount of 171 Gooseberry Shows, held in different places during that\r\nyear; and this fact shows on how large a scale the culture has been\r\ncarried on. The fruit of the wild gooseberry is said[126] to weigh\r\nabout a quarter of an ounce or 5 dwts., that is, 120 grains; about the\r\nyear 1786 gooseberries were exhibited weighing 10 dwts., so that the\r\nweight was then doubled; in 1817 26 dwts. 17 grs. was attained; there\r\nwas no advance till 1825, when 31 dwts. 16 grs. was reached; in 1830\r\n“Teazer” weighed 32 dwts. 13 grs.; in 1841 “Wonderful” weighed 32 dwts.\r\n16 grs.; in 1844 “London” weighed 35 dwts. 12 grs., and in the\r\nfollowing year 36 dwts. 16 grs.; and in 1852 in Staffordshire, the\r\nfruit of the same variety reached the astonishing weight of 37 dwts. 7\r\ngrs.[127] or 896 grs.; that is, between seven or eight times the weight\r\nof the wild fruit. I find that a small apple, 6½ inches in\r\ncircumference, has exactly this same weight. The “London” gooseberry\r\n(which in 1852 had altogether gained 333 prizes) has, up to the present\r\nyear of 1875, never reached a greater weight than that attained in\r\n1852. Perhaps the fruit of the gooseberry has now reached the greatest\r\npossible weight, unless in the course of time some new and distinct\r\nvariety shall arise.\r\n\r\nThis gradual, and on the whole steady increase of weight from the\r\nlatter part of the last century to the year 1852, is probably in large\r\npart due to improved methods of cultivation, for extreme care is now\r\ntaken; the branches and roots are trained, composts are made, the soil\r\nis mulched, and only a few berries are left on each bush;[128] but the\r\nincrease no doubt is in main part due to the continued selection of\r\nseedlings which have been found to be more and more capable of yielding\r\nsuch extraordinary fruit. Assuredly the “Highwayman” in 1817 could not\r\nhave produced fruit like that of the “Roaring Lion” in 1825; nor could\r\nthe “Roaring Lion,” though it was grown by many persons in many places,\r\ngain the supreme triumph achieved in 1852 by the “London” Gooseberry.\r\n\r\n_Walnut (Juglans regia)._—This tree and the common nut belong to a\r\nwidely different order from the foregoing fruits, and are therefore\r\nhere noticed. The walnut grows wild on the Caucasus and in the\r\nHimalaya, where Dr. Hooker[129] found the fruit of full size, but “as\r\nhard as a hickory-nut.” It has been found fossil, as M. de Saporta\r\ninforms me, in the tertiary formation, of France.\r\n\r\nIn England the walnut presents considerable differences, in the shape\r\nand size of the fruit, in the thickness of the husk, and in the\r\nthinness of the shell; this latter quality has given rise to a variety\r\ncalled the thin-shelled, which is valuable, but suffers from the\r\nattacks of tit-mice.[130] The degree to which the kernel fills the\r\nshell varies much. In France there is a variety called the Grape or\r\ncluster-walnut, in which the nuts grow in “bunches of ten, fifteen, or\r\neven twenty together.” There is another variety which bears on the same\r\ntree differently shaped leaves, like the heterophyllous hornbeam; this\r\ntree is also remarkable from having pendulous branches, and bearing\r\nelongated, large, thin-shelled nuts.[131] M. Cardan has minutely\r\ndescribed[132] some singular physiological peculiarities in the\r\nJune-leafing variety, which produces its leaves and flowers four or\r\nfive weeks later than the common varieties; and although in August it\r\nis apparently in exactly the same state of forwardness as the other\r\nkinds, it retains its leaves and fruit much later in the autumn. These\r\nconstitutional peculiarities are strictly inherited. Lastly,\r\nwalnut-trees, which are properly monoicous, sometimes entirely fail to\r\nproduce male flowers.[133]\r\n\r\n_Nuts (Corylus avellana)._—Most botanists rank all the varieties under\r\nthe same species, the common wild nut.[134] The husk, or involucre,\r\ndiffers greatly, being extremely short in Barr’s Spanish, and extremely\r\nlong in filberts, in which it is contracted so as to prevent the nut\r\nfalling out. This kind of husk also protects the nut from birds, for\r\ntitmice (_Parus_) have been observed [135] to pass over filberts, and\r\nattack cobs and common nuts growing in the same orchard. In the\r\npurple-filbert the husk is purple, and in the frizzled-filbert it is\r\ncuriously laciniated; in the red-filbert the pellicle of the kernel is\r\nred. The shell is thick in some varieties, but is thin in\r\nCosford’s-nut, and in one variety is of a bluish colour. The nut itself\r\ndiffers much in size and shape, being ovate and compressed in filberts,\r\nnearly round and of great size in cobs and Spanish nuts, oblong and\r\nlongitudinally striated in Cosford’s, and obtusely four-sided in the\r\nDownton Square nut.\r\n\r\n_Cucurbitaceous plants._—These plants have been for a long period the\r\nopprobrium of botanists; numerous varieties have been ranked as\r\nspecies, and, what happens more rarely, forms which now must be\r\nconsidered as species have been classed as varieties. Owing to the\r\nadmirable experimental researches of a distinguished botanist, M.\r\nNaudin,[136] a flood of light has recently been thrown on this group of\r\nplants. M. Naudin, during many years, observed and experimented on\r\nabove 1200 living specimens, collected from all quarters of the world.\r\nSix species are now recognised in the genus Cucurbita; but three alone\r\nhave been cultivated and concern us, namely, _C. maxima_ and _pepo,_\r\nwhich include all pumpkins, gourds, squashes, and the vegetable marrow,\r\nand _C. moschata._ These three species are not known in a wild state;\r\nbut Asa Gray[137] gives good reason for believing that some pumpkins\r\nare natives of N. America.\r\n\r\nThese three species are closely allied, and have the same general\r\nhabit, but their innumerable varieties can always be distinguished,\r\naccording to Naudin, by certain almost fixed characters; and what is\r\nstill more important, when crossed they yield no seed, or only sterile\r\nseed; whilst the varieties spontaneously intercross with the utmost\r\nfreedom. Naudin insists strongly (p. 15), that, though these three\r\nspecies have varied greatly in many characters, yet it has been in so\r\nclosely an analogous manner that the varieties can he arranged in\r\nalmost parallel series, as we have seen with the forms of wheat, with\r\nthe two main races of the peach, and in other cases. Though some of the\r\nvarieties are inconstant in character, yet others, when grown\r\nseparately under uniform conditions of life, are, as Naudin repeatedly\r\n(pp. 6, 16, 35) urges, “douées d’une stabilité presque comparable à\r\ncelle des espèces les mieux caractérisées.” One variety, l’Orangin (pp.\r\n43, 63), has such prepotency in transmitting its character, that when\r\ncrossed with other varieties a vast majority of the seedlings come\r\ntrue. Naudin, referring (p. 47) to _C. pepo,_ says that its races “ne\r\ndifferent des espèces veritables qu’en ce qu’elles peuvent s’allier les\r\nunes aux autres par voie d’hybridité, sans que leur descendance perde\r\nla faculté de se perpétuer.” If we were to trust to external\r\ndifferences alone, and give up the test of sterility, a multitude of\r\nspecies would have to be formed out of the varieties of these three\r\nspecies of Cucurbita. Many naturalists at the present day lay far too\r\nlittle stress, in my opinion, on the test of sterility; yet it is not\r\nimprobable that distinct species of plants after a long course of\r\ncultivation and variation may have their mutual sterility eliminated,\r\nas we have every reason to believe has occurred with domesticated\r\nanimals. Nor, in the case of plants under cultivation, should we be\r\njustified in assuming that varieties never acquire a slight degree of\r\nmutual sterility, as we shall more fully see in a future chapter when\r\ncertain facts are given on the high authority of Gärtner and\r\nKölreuter.[138]\r\n\r\nThe forms of _C. pepo_ are classed by Naudin under seven sections, each\r\nincluding subordinate varieties. He considers this plant as probably\r\nthe most variable in the world. The fruit of one variety (pp. 33, 46)\r\nexceeds in value that of another by more than two thousand fold! When\r\nthe fruit is of very large size, the number produced is few (p. 45);\r\nwhen of small size, many are produced. No less astonishing (p. 33) is\r\nthe variation in the shape of the fruit, the typical form apparently is\r\negg-like, but this becomes either drawn out into a cylinder, or\r\nshortened into a flat disc. We have also an almost infinite diversity\r\nin the colour and state of surface of the fruit, in the hardness both\r\nof the shell and of the flesh, and in the taste of the flesh, which is\r\neither extremely sweet, farinaceous, or slightly bitter. The seeds also\r\ndiffer in a slight degree in shape, and wonderfully in size (p. 34),\r\nnamely, from six or seven to more than twenty-five millimètres in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIn the varieties which grow upright or do not run and climb, the\r\ntendrils, though useless (p. 31), are either present or are represented\r\nby various semi-monstrous organs, or are quite absent. The tendrils are\r\neven absent in some running varieties in which the stems are much\r\nelongated. It is a singular fact that (p. 31) in all the varieties with\r\ndwarfed stems, the leaves closely resemble each other in shape.\r\n\r\nThose naturalists who believe in the immutability of species often\r\nmaintain that, even in the most variable forms, the characters which\r\nthey consider of specific value are unchangeable. To give an example\r\nfrom a conscientious writer,[139] who, relying on the labours of M.\r\nNaudin, and referring to the species of Cucurbita, says, “au milieu de\r\ntoutes les variations du fruit, les tiges, les feuilles, les calices,\r\nles corolles, les étamines restent invariables dans chacune d’elles.”\r\nYet M. Naudin, in describing _ Cucurbita pepo_ (p. 30), says, “Ici,\r\nd’ailleurs, ce ne sont pas seulement les fruits qui varient, c’est\r\naussi le feuillage et tout le port de la plante. Néanmoins, je crois\r\nqu’on la distinguera toujours facilement des deux autres espèces, si\r\nl’on veut ne pas perdre de vue les caractères différentiels que je\r\nm’efforce de faire ressortir. Ces caractères sont quelquefois peu\r\nmarqués: il arrive meme que plusieurs d’entre eux s’effacent presque\r\nentièrement, mais ii en reste toujours quelques-uns qui remettent\r\nl’observateur sur la voie.” Now let it be noted what a difference, with\r\nregard to the immutability of the so-called specific characters this\r\nparagraph produces on the mind, from that above quoted from M. Godron.\r\n\r\nI will add another remark: naturalists continually assert that no\r\nimportant organ varies; but in saying this they unconsciously argue in\r\na vicious circle; for if an organ, let it be what it may, is highly\r\nvariable, it is regarded as unimportant, and under a systematic point\r\nof view this is quite correct. But as long as constancy is thus taken\r\nas the criterion of importance, it will indeed be long before an\r\nimportant organ can be shown to be inconstant. The enlarged form of the\r\nstigmas, and their sessile position on the summit of the ovary, must be\r\nconsidered as important characters, and were used by Gasparini to\r\nseparate certain pumpkins as a _distinct genus_; but Naudin says (p.\r\n20), these parts have no constancy, and in the flowers of the Turban\r\nvarieties of _C. maxima_ they sometimes resume their ordinary\r\nstructure. Again, in _C. maxima,_ the carpels (p. 19) which form the\r\nturban project even as much as two-thirds of their length out of the\r\nreceptacle, and this latter part is thus reduced to a sort of platform;\r\nbut this remarkable structure occurs only in certain varieties, and\r\ngraduates into the common form in which the carpels are almost entirely\r\nenveloped within the receptacle. In _ C. moschata_ the ovarium (p. 50)\r\nvaries greatly in shape, being oval, nearly spherical, or cylindrical,\r\nmore or less swollen in the upper part, or constricted round the\r\nmiddle, and either straight or curved. When the ovarium is short and\r\noval the interior structure does not differ from that of _C. maxima_\r\nand _pepo,_ but when it is elongated the carpels occupy only the\r\nterminal and swollen portion. I may add that in one variety of the\r\ncucumber (_Cucumis sativus_) the fruit regularly contains five carpels\r\ninstead of three.[140] I presume that it will not be disputed that we\r\nhere have instances of great variability in organs of the highest\r\nphysiological importance, and with most plants of the highest\r\nclassificatory importance.\r\n\r\nSageret[141] and Naudin found that the cucumber (_C. sativus_) could\r\nnot be crossed with any other species of the genus; therefore no doubt\r\nit is specifically distinct from the melon. This will appear to most\r\npersons a superfluous statement; yet we hear from Naudin[142] that\r\nthere is a race of melons, in which the fruit is so like that of the\r\ncucumber, “both externally and internally, that it is hardly possible\r\nto distinguish the one from the other except by the leaves.” The\r\nvarieties of the melon seem to be endless, for Naudin after six years’\r\nstudy had not come to the end of them: he divides them into ten\r\nsections, including numerous sub-varieties which all intercross with\r\nperfect ease.[143] Of the forms considered by Naudin to be varieties,\r\nbotanists have made thirty distinct species! “and they had not the\r\nslightest acquaintance with the multitude of new forms which have\r\nappeared since their time.” Nor is the creation of so many species at\r\nall surprising when we consider how strictly their characters are\r\ntransmitted by seed, and how wonderfully they differ in appearance:\r\n“Mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas, sed multo magis\r\nfructuum,” says Naudin. The fruit is the valuable part, and this, in\r\naccordance with the common rule, is the most modified part. Some melons\r\nare only as large as small plums, others weigh as much as sixty-six\r\npounds. One variety has a scarlet fruit! Another is not more than an\r\ninch in diameter, but sometimes more than a yard in length, “twisting\r\nabout in all directions like a serpent.” It is a singular fact that in\r\nthis latter variety many parts of the plant, namely, the stems, the\r\nfootstalks of the female flowers, the middle lobe of the leaves, and\r\nespecially the ovarium, as well as the mature fruit, all show a strong\r\ntendency to become elongated. Several varieties of the melon are\r\ninteresting from assuming the characteristic features of distinct\r\nspecies and even of distinct though allied genera: thus the\r\nserpent-melon has some resemblance to the fruit of _Trichosanthes\r\nanguina_; we have seen that other varieties closely resemble cucumbers;\r\nsome Egyptian varieties have their seeds attached to a portion of the\r\npulp, and this is characteristic of certain wild forms. Lastly, a\r\nvariety of melon from Algiers is remarkable from announcing its\r\nmaturity by “a spontaneous and almost sudden dislocation,” when deep\r\ncracks suddenly appear, and the fruit falls to pieces; and this occurs\r\nwith the wild _C. momordica._ Finally, M. Naudin well remarks that this\r\n“extraordinary production of races and varieties by a single species\r\nand their permanence when not interfered with by crossing, are\r\nphenomena well calculated to cause reflection.”\r\n\r\n      USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL TREES.\r\n\r\nTrees deserve a passing notice on account of the numerous varieties\r\nwhich they present, differing in their precocity, in their manner of\r\ngrowth, their foliage, and bark. Thus of the common ash (_Fraxinus\r\nexcelsior_) the catalogue of Messrs. Lawson of Edinburgh includes\r\ntwenty-one varieties, some of which differ much in their bark; there is\r\na yellow, a streaked reddish-white, a purple, a wart-barked and a\r\nfungous-barked variety.[144] Of hollies no less than eighty-four\r\nvarieties are grown alongside each other in Mr. Paul’s nursery.[145] In\r\nthe case of trees, all the recorded varieties, as far as I can find\r\nout, have been suddenly produced by one single act of variation. The\r\nlength of time required to raise many generations, and the little value\r\nset on the fanciful varieties, explains how it is that successive\r\nmodifications have not been accumulated by selection; hence, also, it\r\nfollows that we do not here meet with sub-varieties subordinate to\r\nvarieties, and these again subordinate to higher groups. On the\r\nContinent, however, where the forests are more carefully attended to\r\nthan in England, Alph. De Candolle[146] says that there is not a\r\nforester who does not search for seeds from that variety which he\r\nesteems the most valuable.\r\n\r\nOur useful trees have seldom been exposed to any great change of\r\nconditions; they have not been richly manured, and the English kinds\r\ngrow under their proper climate. Yet in examining extensive beds of\r\nseedlings in nursery-gardens considerable differences may be generally\r\nobserved in them; and whilst touring in England I have been surprised\r\nat the amount of difference in the appearance of the same species in\r\nour hedgerows and woods. But as plants vary so much in a truly wild\r\nstate, it would be difficult for even a skilful botanist to pronounce\r\nwhether, as I believe to be the case, hedgerow trees vary more than\r\nthose growing in a primeval forest. Trees when planted by man in woods\r\nor hedges do not grow where they would naturally be able to hold their\r\nplace against a host of competitors, and are therefore exposed to\r\nconditions not strictly natural: even this slight change would probably\r\nsuffice to cause seedlings raised from such trees to be variable.\r\nWhether or not our half-wild English trees, as a general rule, are more\r\nvariable than trees growing in their native forests, there can hardly\r\nbe a doubt that they have yielded a greater number of strongly-marked\r\nand singular variations of structure.\r\n\r\nIn manner of growth, we have weeping or pendulous varieties of the\r\nwillow, ash, elm, oak, and yew, and other trees; and this weeping habit\r\nis sometimes inherited, though in a singularly capricious manner. In\r\nthe Lombardy poplar, and in certain fastigiate or pyramidal varieties\r\nof thorns, junipers, oaks, etc., we have an opposite kind of growth.\r\nThe Hessian oak,[147] which is famous from its fastigiate habit and\r\nsize, bears hardly any resemblance in general appearance to a common\r\noak; “its acorns are not sure to produce plants of the same habit;\r\nsome, however, turn out the same as the parent-tree.” Another\r\nfastigiate oak is said to have been found wild in the Pyrenees, and\r\nthis is a surprising circumstance; it generally comes so true by seed,\r\nthat De Candolle considered it as specifically distinct.[148] The\r\nfastigiate Juniper (_J. suecica_) likewise transmits its character by\r\nseed.[149] Dr. Falconer informs me that in the Botanic Gardens at\r\nCalcutta the great heat caused apple-trees to become fastigiate; and we\r\nthus see the same result following from the effects of climate and from\r\nsome unknown cause.[150]\r\n\r\nIn foliage we have variegated leaves which are often inherited; dark\r\npurple or red leaves, as in the hazel, barberry, and beech, the colour\r\nin these two latter trees being sometimes strongly and sometimes weakly\r\ninherited;[151] deeply-cut leaves; and leaves covered with prickles, as\r\nin the variety of the holly well called _ ferox,_ which is said to\r\nreproduce itself by seed.[152] In fact, nearly all the peculiar\r\nvarieties evince a tendency, more or less strongly marked, to reproduce\r\nthemselves by seed.[153] This is to a certain extent the case,\r\naccording to Bosc,[154] with three varieties of the elm, namely, the\r\nbroad-leafed, lime-leafed, and twisted elm, in which latter the fibres\r\nof the wood are twisted. Even with the heterophyllous hornbeam\r\n(_Carpinus betulus_), which bears on each twig leaves of two shapes,\r\nseveral plants raised from seed all retained “the same\r\npeculiarity.”[155] I will add only one other remarkable case of\r\nvariation in foliage, namely, the occurrence of two sub-varieties of\r\nthe ash with simple instead of pinnated leaves, and which generally\r\ntransmit their character by seed.[156] The occurrence, in trees\r\nbelonging to widely different orders, of weeping and fastigiate\r\nvarieties, and of trees bearing deeply cut, variegated, and purple\r\nleaves, shows that these deviations of structure must result from some\r\nvery general physiological laws.\r\n\r\nDifferences in general appearance and foliage, not more strongly marked\r\nthan those above indicated, have led good observers to rank as distinct\r\nspecies certain forms which are now known to be mere varieties. Thus, a\r\nplane-tree long cultivated in England was considered by almost every\r\none as a North American species: but is now ascertained by old records,\r\nas I am informed by Dr. Hooker, to be a variety. So, again, the _Thuja\r\npendula_ or _filiformis_ was ranked by such good observers as Lambert,\r\nWallich, and others, as a true species; but it is now known that the\r\noriginal plants, five in number, suddenly appeared in a bed of\r\nseedlings, raised at Mr. Loddige’s nursery, from _T. orientalis_; and\r\nDr. Hooker has adduced excellent evidence that at Turin seeds of _T.\r\npendula_ have reproduced the parent form, _T. orientalis._[157]\r\n\r\nEvery one must have noticed how certain individual trees regularly put\r\nforth and shed their leaves earlier or later than others of the same\r\nspecies. There is a famous horse-chestnut in the Tuileries which is\r\nnamed from leafing so much earlier than the others. There is also an\r\noak near Edinburgh which retains its leaves to a very late period.\r\nThese differences have been attributed by some authors to the nature of\r\nthe soil in which the trees grow; but Archbishop Whately grafted an\r\nearly thorn on a late one, and _vice versa,_ and both grafts kept to\r\ntheir proper periods, which differed by about a fortnight, as if they\r\nstill grew on their own stocks.[158] There is a Cornish variety of the\r\nelm which is almost an evergreen, and is so tender that the shoots are\r\noften killed by the frost; and the varieties of the Turkish oak (_Q.\r\ncerris_) may be arranged as deciduous, sub-evergreen, and\r\nevergreen.[159]\r\n\r\n_Scotch Fir (Pinus sylvestris)._—I allude to this tree as it bears on\r\nthe question of the greater variability of our hedgerow trees compared\r\nwith those under strictly natural conditions. A well-informed\r\nwriter[160] states that the Scotch fir presents few varieties in its\r\nnative Scotch forests; but that it “varies much in figure and foliage,\r\nand in the size, shape, and colour of its cones, when several\r\ngenerations have been produced away from its native locality.” There is\r\nlittle doubt that the highland and lowland varieties differ in the\r\nvalue of their timber, and that they can be propagated truly by seed;\r\nthus justifying Loudon’s remark, that “a variety is often of as much\r\nimportance as a species, and sometimes far more so.”[161] I may mention\r\none rather important point in which this tree occasionally varies; in\r\nthe classification of the Coniferæ, sections are founded on whether\r\ntwo, three, or five leaves are included in the same sheath; the Scotch\r\nfir has properly only two leaves thus enclosed, but specimens have been\r\nobserved with groups of three leaves in a sheath.[162] Besides these\r\ndifferences in the semi-cultivated Scotch fir, there are in several\r\nparts of Europe natural or geographical races, which have been ranked\r\nby some authors as distinct species.[163] Loudon[164] considers _P.\r\npumilio,_ with its several sub-varieties, as _mughus, nana,_ etc.,\r\nwhich differ much when planted in different soils, and only come\r\n“tolerably true from seed,” as alpine varieties of the Scotch fir; if\r\nthis were proved to be the case, it would be an interesting fact as\r\nshowing that dwarfing from long exposure to a severe climate is to a\r\ncertain extent inherited.\r\n\r\nThe _Hawthorn (Cratægus oxyacantha)._ has varied much. Besides endless\r\nslighter variations in the form of the leaves, and in the size,\r\nhardness, fleshiness, and shape of the berries, Loudon[165] enumerates\r\ntwenty-nine well-marked varieties. Besides those cultivated for their\r\npretty flowers, there are others with golden-yellow, black, and whitish\r\nberries; others with woolly berries, and others with re-curved thorns.\r\nLoudon truly remarks that the chief reason why the hawthorn has yielded\r\nmore varieties than most other trees, is that nurserymen select any\r\nremarkable variety out of the immense beds of seedlings which are\r\nannually raised for making hedges. The flowers of the hawthorn usually\r\ninclude from one to three pistils; but in two varieties, named monogyna\r\nand sibirica, there is only a single pistil; and d’Asso states that the\r\ncommon thorn in Spain is constantly in this state.[166] There is also a\r\nvariety which is apetalous, or has its petals reduced to mere\r\nrudiments. The famous Glastonbury thorn flowers and leafs towards the\r\nend of December, at which time it bears berries produced from an\r\nearlier crop of flowers.[167] It is worth notice that several varieties\r\nof the hawthorn, as well as of the lime and juniper, are very distinct\r\nin their foliage and habit whilst young, but in the course of thirty or\r\nforty years become extremely like each other;[168] thus reminding us of\r\nthe well-known fact that the deodar, the cedar of Lebanon, and that of\r\nthe Atlas, are distinguished with the greatest ease whilst young, but\r\nwith difficulty when old.\r\n\r\n      FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nI shall not for several reasons treat the variability of plants which\r\nare cultivated for their flowers alone at any great length. Many of our\r\nfavourite kinds in their present state are the descendants of two or\r\nmore species crossed and commingled together, and this circumstance\r\nalone would render it difficult to detect the difference due to\r\nvariation. For instance, our Roses, Petunias, Calceolarias, Fuchsias,\r\nVerbenas, Gladioli, Pelargoniums, etc., certainly have had a multiple\r\norigin. A botanist well acquainted with the parent-forms would probably\r\ndetect some curious structural differences in their crossed and\r\ncultivated descendant; and he would certainly observe many new and\r\nremarkable constitutional peculiarities. I will give a few instances,\r\nall relating to the Pelargonium, and taken chiefly from Mr. Beck,[169]\r\na famous cultivator of this plant: some varieties require more water\r\nthan others; some are “very impatient of the knife if too greedily used\r\nin making cuttings;” some, when potted, scarcely “show a root at the\r\noutside of the ball of the earth;” one variety requires a certain\r\namount of confinement in the pot to make it throw up a flower-stem;\r\nsome varieties bloom well at the commencement of the season, others at\r\nthe close; one variety is known,[170] which will stand “even pine-apple\r\ntop and bottom heat, without looking any more drawn than if it had\r\nstood in a common greenhouse; and Blanche Fleur seems as if made on\r\npurpose for growing in winter, like many bulbs, and to rest all\r\nsummer.” These odd constitutional peculiarities would enable a plant in\r\na state of nature to become adapted to widely different circumstances\r\nand climates.\r\n\r\nFlowers possess little interest under our present point of view,\r\nbecause they have been almost exclusively attended to and selected for\r\ntheir beautiful colour, size, perfect outline, and manner of growth. In\r\nthese particulars hardly one long-cultivated flower can be named which\r\nhas not varied greatly. What does a florist care for the shape and\r\nstructure of the organs of fructification, unless, indeed, they add to\r\nthe beauty of the flower? When this is the case, flowers become\r\nmodified in important points; stamens and pistils may be converted into\r\npetals, and additional petals may be developed, as in all double\r\nflowers. The process of gradual selection by which flowers have been\r\nrendered more and more double, each step in the process of conversion\r\nbeing inherited, has been recorded in several instances. In the\r\nso-called double flowers of the Compositæ, the corollas of the central\r\nflorets are greatly modified, and the modifications are likewise\r\ninherited. In the columbine (_Aquilegia vulgaris_) some of the stamens\r\nare converted into petals having the shape of nectaries, one neatly\r\nfitting into the other; but in one variety they are converted into\r\nsimple petals.[171] In the “hose in hose” primulæ, the calyx becomes\r\nbrightly coloured and enlarged so as to resemble a corolla; and Mr. W.\r\nWooler informs me that this peculiarity is transmitted; for he crossed\r\na common polyanthus with one having a coloured calyx,[172] and some of\r\nthe seedlings inherited the coloured calyx during at least six\r\ngenerations. In the “hen-and-chicken” daisy the main flower is\r\nsurrounded by a brood of small flowers developed from buds in the axils\r\nof the scales of the involucre. A wonderful poppy has been described,\r\nin which the stamens are converted into pistils; and so strictly was\r\nthis peculiarity inherited that, out of 154 seedlings, one alone\r\nreverted to the ordinary and common type.[173] Of the cock’s-comb\r\n(_Celosia cristata_), which is an annual, there are several races in\r\nwhich the flower-stem is wonderfully “fasciated” or compressed; and one\r\nhas been exhibited[174] actually eighteen inches in breadth. Peloric\r\nraces of _Gloxinia speciosa_ and _Antirrhinum majus_ can be propagated\r\nby seed, and they differ in a wonderful manner from the typical form\r\nboth in structure and appearance.\r\n\r\nA much more remarkable modification has been recorded by Sir William\r\nand Dr. Hooker[175] in _Begonia frigida._ This plant properly produces\r\nmale and female flowers on the same fascicles; and in the female\r\nflowers the perianth is superior; but a plant at Kew produced, besides\r\nthe ordinary flowers, others which graduated towards a perfect\r\nhermaphrodite structure; and in these flowers the perianth was\r\ninferior. To show the importance of this modification under a\r\nclassificatory point of view, I may quote what Prof. Harvey says,\r\nnamely, that had it “occurred in a state of nature, and had a botanist\r\ncollected a plant with such flowers, he would not only have placed it\r\nin a distinct genus from Begonia, but would probably have considered it\r\nas the type of a new natural order.” This modification cannot in one\r\nsense be considered as a monstrosity, for analogous structures\r\nnaturally occur in other orders, as with Saxifragæ and Aristolochiaceæ.\r\nThe interest of the case is largely added to by Mr. C. W. Crocker’s\r\nobservation that seedlings from the _normal_ flowers produced plants\r\nwhich bore, in about the same proportion as the parent-plant,\r\nhermaphrodite flowers having inferior perianths. The hermaphrodite\r\nflowers fertilised with their own pollen were sterile.\r\n\r\nIf florists had attended to, selected, and propagated by seed other\r\nmodifications of structure besides those which are beautiful, a host of\r\ncurious varieties would certainly have been raised; and they would\r\nprobably have transmitted their characters so truly that the cultivator\r\nwould have felt aggrieved, as in the case of culinary vegetables, if\r\nhis whole bed had not presented a uniform appearance. Florists have\r\nattended in some instances to the leaves of their plant, and have thus\r\nproduced the most elegant and symmetrical patterns of white, red, and\r\ngreen, which, as in the case of the pelargonium, are sometimes strictly\r\ninherited.[176] Any one who will habitually examine highly-cultivated\r\nflowers in gardens and greenhouses will observe numerous deviations in\r\nstructure; but most of these must be ranked as mere monstrosities, and\r\nare only so far interesting as showing how plastic the organisation\r\nbecomes under high cultivation. From this point of view such works as\r\nProfessor Moquin-Tandon’s ‘Tératologie’ are highly instructive.\r\n\r\n_Roses._—These flowers offer an instance of a number of forms generally\r\nranked as species, namely, _R. centifolia, gallica, alba, damascena,\r\nspinosissima, bracteata, indica, semperflorens, moschata,_ etc., which\r\nhave largely varied and been intercrossed. The genus Rosa is a\r\nnotoriously difficult one, and, though some of the above forms are\r\nadmitted by all botanists to be distinct species, others are doubtful;\r\nthus, with respect to the British forms, Babington makes seventeen, and\r\nBentham only five species. The hybrids from some of the most distinct\r\nforms—for instance, from _R. indica,_ fertilised by the pollen of _R.\r\ncentifolia_—produce an abundance of seed; I state this on the authority\r\nof Mr. Rivers,[177] from whose work I have drawn most of the following\r\nstatements. As almost all the aboriginal forms brought from different\r\ncountries have been crossed and re-crossed, it is no wonder that\r\nTargioni-Tozzetti, in speaking of the common roses of the Italian\r\ngardens, remarks that “the native country and precise form of the wild\r\ntype of most of them are involved in much uncertainty.”[178]\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Rivers in referring to _R. indica_ (p. 68) says that\r\nthe descendants of each group may generally be recognised by a close\r\nobserver. The same author often speaks of roses as having been a little\r\nhybridised; but it is evident that in very many cases the differences\r\ndue to variation and to hybridisation can now only be conjecturally\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe species have varied both by seed and by bud; such modified buds\r\nbeing often called by gardeners sports. In the following chapter I\r\nshall fully discuss this latter subject, and shall show that\r\nbud-variations can be propagated not only by grafting and budding, but\r\noften by seed. Whenever a new rose appears with any peculiar character,\r\nhowever produced, if it yields seed, Mr. Rivers (p. 4) fully expects it\r\nto become the parent-type of a new family. The tendency to vary is so\r\nstrong in some kinds, as in the Village Maid (Rivers, p. 16), that when\r\ngrown in different soils it varies so much in colour that it has been\r\nthought to form several distinct kinds. Altogether the number of kinds\r\nis very great: thus M. Desportes, in his Catalogue for 1829, enumerates\r\n2562 as cultivated in France; but no doubt a large proportion of these\r\nare merely nominal.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to specify the many points of difference between\r\nthe various kinds, but some constitutional peculiarities may be\r\nmentioned. Several French roses (Rivers, p. 12) will not succeed in\r\nEngland; and an excellent horticulturist[179] remarks, that “Even in\r\nthe same garden you will find that a rose that will do nothing under a\r\nsouth wall will do well under a north one. That is the case with Paul\r\nJoseph here. It grows strongly and blooms beautifully close to a north\r\nwall. For three years seven plants have done nothing under a south\r\nwall.” Many roses can be forced, “many are totally unfit for forcing,\r\namong which is General Jacqueminot.”[180] From the effects of crossing\r\nand variation Mr. Rivers enthusiastically anticipates (p. 87) that the\r\nday will come when all our roses, even moss-roses, will have evergreen\r\nfoliage, brilliant and fragrant flowers, and the habit of blooming from\r\nJune till November. “A distant view this seems, but perseverance in\r\ngardening will yet achieve wonders,” as assuredly it has already\r\nachieved wonders.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while briefly to give the well-known history of one\r\nclass of roses. In 1793 some wild Scotch roses (_R. spinosissima_) were\r\ntransplanted into a garden;[181] and one of these bore flowers slightly\r\ntinged with red, from which a plant was raised with semi-monstrous\r\nflowers, also tinged with red; seedlings from this flower were\r\nsemi-double, and by continued selection, in about nine or ten years,\r\neight sub-varieties were raised. In the course of less than twenty\r\nyears these double Scotch roses had so much increased in number and\r\nkind, that twenty-six well-marked varieties, classed in eight sections,\r\nwere described by Mr. Sabine. In 1841[182] it is said that three\r\nhundred varieties could be procured in the nursery-gardens near\r\nGlasgow; and these are described as blush, crimson, purple, red,\r\nmarbled, two-coloured, white, and yellow, and as differing much in the\r\nsize and shape of the flower.\r\n\r\n_Pansy or Heartsease (Viola tricolor, etc.)._—The history of this\r\nflower seems to be pretty well known; it was grown in Evelyn’s garden\r\nin 1687; but the varieties were not attended to till 1810-1812, when\r\nLady Monke, together with Mr. Lee, the well-known nursery-man,\r\nenergetically commenced their culture; and in the course of a few years\r\ntwenty varieties could be purchased.[183] At about the same period,\r\nnamely in 1813 or 1814, Lord Gambier collected some wild plants, and\r\nhis gardener, Mr. Thomson, cultivated them, together with some common\r\ngarden varieties, and soon effected a great improvement. The first\r\ngreat change was the conversion of the dark lines in the centre of the\r\nflower into a dark eye or centre, which at that period had never been\r\nseen, but is now considered one of the chief requisites of a first-rate\r\nflower. In 1835 a book entirely devoted to this flower was published,\r\nand four hundred named varieties were on sale. From these circumstances\r\nthis plant seemed to me worth studying, more especially from the great\r\ncontrast between the small, dull, elongated, irregular flowers of the\r\nwild pansy, and the beautiful, flat, symmetrical, circular, velvet-like\r\nflowers, more than two inches in diameter, magnificently and variously\r\ncoloured, which are exhibited at our shows. But when I came to enquire\r\nmore closely, I found that, though the varieties were so modern, yet\r\nthat much confusion and doubt prevailed about their parentage. Florists\r\nbelieve that the varieties[184] are descended from several wild stocks,\r\nnamely, _V. tricolor, lutea, grandiflora, amœna,_ and _altaica,_ more\r\nor less intercrossed. And when I looked to botanical works to ascertain\r\nwhether these forms ought to be ranked as species, I found equal doubt\r\nand confusion. _Viola altaica_ seems to be a distinct form, but what\r\npart it has played in the origin of our varieties I know not; it is\r\nsaid to have been crossed with _V. lutea. Viola amœna_[185] is now\r\nlooked at by all botanists as a natural variety of _V. grandiflora_;\r\nand this and _V. sudetica_ have been proved to be identical with _V.\r\nlutea._ The latter and _V. tricolor_ (including its admitted variety\r\n_V. arvensis_) are ranked as distinct species by Babington, and\r\nlikewise by M. Gay,[186] who has paid particular attention to the\r\ngenus; but the specific distinction between _V. lutea_ and _tricolor_\r\nis chiefly grounded on the one being strictly and the other not\r\nstrictly perennial, as well as on some other slight and unimportant\r\ndifferences in the form of the stem and stipules. Bentham unites these\r\ntwo forms; and a high authority on such matters, Mr. H. C. Watson,[187]\r\nsays that, “while _V. tricolor_ passes into _V. arvensis_ on the one\r\nside, it approximates so much towards _V. lutea_ and _V. Curtisii_ on\r\nthe other side, that a distinction becomes scarcely more easy between\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nHence, after having carefully compared numerous varieties, I gave up\r\nthe attempt as too difficult for any one except a professed botanist.\r\nMost of the varieties present such inconstant characters, that when\r\ngrown in poor soil, or when flowering out of their proper season, they\r\nproduced differently coloured and much smaller flowers. Cultivators\r\nspeak of this or that kind as being remarkably constant or true; but by\r\nthis they do not mean, as in other cases, that the kind transmits its\r\ncharacter by seed, but that the individual plant does not change much\r\nunder culture. The principle of inheritance, however, does hold good to\r\na certain extent even with the fleeting varieties of the Heartsease,\r\nfor to gain good sorts it is indispensable to sow the seed of good\r\nsorts. Nevertheless, in almost every large seed-bed a few, almost wild\r\nseedlings reappear through reversion. On comparing the choicest\r\nvarieties with the nearest allied wild forms, besides the difference in\r\nthe size, outline, and colour of the flowers, the leaves sometimes\r\ndiffer in shape, as does the calyx occasionally in the length and\r\nbreadth of the sepals. The differences in the form of the nectary more\r\nespecially deserve notice; because characters derived from this organ\r\nhave been much used in the discrimination of most of the species of\r\nViola. In a large number of flowers compared in 1842 I found that in\r\nthe greater number the nectary was straight; in others the extremity\r\nwas a little turned upwards, or downwards, or inwards, so as to be\r\ncompletely hooked; in others, instead of being hooked, it was first\r\nturned rectangularly downwards, and then backwards and upwards; in\r\nothers, the extremity was considerably enlarged; and lastly, in some\r\nthe basal part was depressed, becoming, as usual, laterally compressed\r\ntowards the extremity. In a large number of flowers, on the other hand,\r\nexamined by me in 1856 from a nursery-garden in a different part of\r\nEngland, the nectary hardly varied at all. Now M. Gay says that in\r\ncertain districts, especially in Auvergne, the nectary of the wild _V.\r\ngrandiflora_ varies in the manner just described. Must we conclude from\r\nthis that the cultivated varieties first mentioned were all descended\r\nfrom _V. grandiflora,_ and that the second lot, though having the same\r\ngeneral appearance, were descended from _V. tricolor,_ of which the\r\nnectary, according to M. Gay, is subject to little variation? Or is it\r\nnot more probable that both these wild forms would be found under other\r\nconditions to vary in the same manner and degree, thus showing that\r\nthey ought not to be ranked as specifically distinct?\r\n\r\nThe _Dahlia_ has been referred to by almost every author who has\r\nwritten on the variation of plants, because it is believed that all the\r\nvarieties are descended from a single species, and because all have\r\narisen since 1802 in France, and since 1804 in England.[188] Mr. Sabine\r\nremarks that “it seems as if some period of cultivation had been\r\nrequired before the fixed qualities of the native plant gave way and\r\nbegan to sport into those changes which now so delight us.”[189] The\r\nflowers have been greatly modified in shape from a flat to a globular\r\nform. Anemone and ranunculus-like races[190] which differ in the form\r\nand arrangement of the florets, have arisen; also dwarfed races, one of\r\nwhich is only eighteen inches in height. The seeds vary much in size.\r\nThe petals are uniformly coloured or tipped or striped, and present an\r\nalmost infinite diversity of tints. Seedlings of fourteen different\r\ncolours[191] have been raised from the same plant; yet, as Mr. Sabine\r\nhas remarked, “many of the seedlings follow their parents in colour.”\r\nThe period of flowering has been considerably hastened, and this has\r\nprobably been effected by continued selection. Salisbury, writing 1808,\r\nsays that they then flowered from September to November; in 1828 some\r\nnew dwarf varieties began flowering in June;[192] and Mr. Grieve\r\ninforms me that the dwarf purple Zelinda in his garden is in full bloom\r\nby the middle of June and sometimes even earlier. Slight constitutional\r\ndifferences have been observed between certain varieties: thus, some\r\nkinds succeed much better in one part of England than in another;[193]\r\nand it has been noticed that some varieties require much more moisture\r\nthan others.[194]\r\n\r\nSuch flowers as the carnation, common tulip, and hyacinth, which are\r\nbelieved to be descended, each from a single wild form, present\r\ninnumerable varieties, differing almost exclusively in the size, form,\r\nand colour of the flowers. These and some other anciently cultivated\r\nplants which have been long propagated by offsets, pipings, bulbs,\r\netc., become so excessively variable, that almost each new plant raised\r\nfrom seed forms a new variety, “all of which to describe particularly,”\r\nas old Gerarde wrote in 1597, “were to roll Sisyphus’s stone, or to\r\nnumber the sands.”\r\n\r\n_Hyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis)._—It may, however, be worth while to\r\ngive a short account of this plant, which was introduced into England\r\nin 1596 from the Levant.[195] The petals of the original flower, says\r\nMr. Paul, were narrow, wrinkled, pointed, and of a flimsy texture; now\r\nthey are broad, smooth, solid, and rounded. The erectness, breadth, and\r\nlength of the whole spike, and the size of the flowers, have all\r\nincreased. The colours have been intensified and diversified. Gerarde,\r\nin 1597, enumerates four, and Parkinson, in 1629, eight varieties. Now\r\nthe varieties are very numerous, and they were still more numerous a\r\ncentury ago. Mr. Paul remarks that “it is interesting to compare the\r\nHyacinths of 1629 with those of 1864, and to mark the improvement. Two\r\nhundred and thirty-five years have elapsed since then, and this simple\r\nflower serves well to illustrate the great fact that the original forms\r\nof nature do not remain fixed and stationary, at least when brought\r\nunder cultivation. While looking at the extremes, we must not, however,\r\nforget that there are intermediate stages which are for the most part\r\nlost to us. Nature will sometimes indulge herself with a leap, but as a\r\nrule her march is slow and gradual.” He adds that the cultivator should\r\nhave “in his mind an ideal of beauty, for the realisation of which he\r\nworks with head and hand.” We thus see how clearly Mr. Paul, an\r\neminently successful cultivator of this flower, appreciates the action\r\nof methodical selection.\r\n\r\nIn a curious and apparently trustworthy treatise, published at\r\nAmsterdam[196] in 1768, it is stated that nearly 2,000 sorts were then\r\nknown; but in 1864 Mr. Paul found only 700 in the largest garden at\r\nHaarlem. In this treatise it is said that not an instance is known of\r\nany one variety reproducing itself truly by seed: the white kinds,\r\nhowever, now[197] almost always yield white hyacinths, and the yellow\r\nkinds come nearly true. The hyacinth is remarkable from having given\r\nrise to varieties with bright blue, pink, and distinctly yellow\r\nflowers. These three primary colours do not occur in the varieties of\r\nany other species; nor do they often all occur even in the distinct\r\nspecies of the same genus. Although the several kinds of hyacinths\r\ndiffer but slightly from each other except in colour, yet each kind has\r\nits own individual character, which can be recognised by a highly\r\neducated eye; thus the writer of the Amsterdam treatise asserts (p. 43)\r\nthat some experienced florists, such as the famous G. Voorhelm, seldom\r\nfailed in a collection of above twelve hundred sorts to recognise each\r\nvariety by the bulb alone! This same writer mentions some few singular\r\nvariations: for instance, the hyacinth commonly produces six leaves,\r\nbut there is one kind (p. 35) which scarcely ever has more than three\r\nleaves; another never more than five; whilst others regularly produce\r\neither seven or eight leaves. A variety, called la Coryphee, invariably\r\nproduces (p. 116) two flower-stems, united together and covered by one\r\nskin. The flower-stem in another kind (p. 128) comes out of the ground\r\nin a coloured sheath, before the appearance of the leaves, and is\r\nconsequently liable to suffer from frost. Another variety always pushes\r\na second flower-stem after the first has begun to develop itself.\r\nLastly, white hyacinths with red, purple, or violet centres (p. 129)\r\nare the most liable to rot. Thus, the hyacinth, like so many previous\r\nplants, when long cultivated and closely watched, is found to offer\r\nmany singular variations.\r\n\r\nIn the two last chapters I have given in some detail the range of\r\nvariation, and the history, as far as known, of a considerable number\r\nof plants, which have been cultivated for various purposes. But some of\r\nthe most variable plants, such as Kidney-beans, Capsicum, Millets,\r\nSorghum, etc., have been passed over; for botanists are not at all\r\nagreed which kinds ought to rank as species and which as varieties; and\r\nthe wild parent-species are unknown.[198] Many plants long cultivated\r\nin tropical countries, such as the Banana, have produced numerous\r\nvarieties; but as these have never been described with even moderate\r\ncare, they are here also passed over. Nevertheless, a sufficient, and\r\nperhaps more than sufficient, number of cases have been given, so that\r\nthe reader may be enabled to judge for himself on the nature and great\r\namount of variation which cultivated plants have undergone.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Heer, ‘Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten,’ 1866, s. 28.\r\n\r\n [2] Alph.

This fact supports the belief that these two forms deserve\r\n to be called species. But the characters separating them are of slight\r\n importance, and of a kind known to vary in other cultivated\r\n fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n [84] _See_ ‘Journ. of Hort.

When the _coccus_ first appeared in this country it\r\n is said (vol. ii. p. 163) that it was more injurious to crab-stocks\r\n than to the apples grafted on them. The Majetin apple has been found\r\n equally free of the coccus at Melbourne in Australia (‘Gard. Chron.,’\r\n 1871, p. 1065). The wood of this tree has been there analysed, and it\r\n is said (but the fact seems a strange one) that its ash contained over\r\n 50 per cent of lime, while that of the crab exhibited not quite 23 per\r\n cent. In Tasmania Mr. Wade (‘Transact. New Zealand Institute,’ vol.\r\n iv. 1871, p. 431) raised seedlings of the Siberian Bitter Sweet for\r\n stocks, and he found barely one per cent of them attacked by the\r\n coccus. Riley shows (‘Fifth Report on Insects of Missouri,’ 1873, p.\r\n 87) that in the United States some varieties of apples are highly\r\n attractive to the coccus and others very little so. Turning to a very\r\n different pest, namely, the caterpillar of a moth (_Carpocapsa\r\n pomonella_), Walsh affirms (‘The American Entomologist,’ April, 1869,\r\n p. 160) that the maiden-blush “is entirely exempt from apple-worms.”\r\n So, it is said, are some few other varieties; whereas others are\r\n “peculiarly subject to the attacks of this little pest.”\r\n\r\n [94] ‘Mém. de La Soc.

By this term I include all those\r\nsudden changes in structure or appearance which occasionally occur in\r\nfull-grown plants in their flower-buds or leaf-buds. Gardeners call\r\nsuch changes “Sports;” but this, as previously remarked, is an\r\nill-defined expression, as it has often been applied to strongly marked\r\nvariations in seedling plants. The difference between seminal and bud\r\nreproduction is not so great as it at first appears; for each bud is in\r\none sense a new and distinct individual; but such individuals are\r\nproduced through the formation of various kinds of buds without the aid\r\nof any special apparatus, whilst fertile seeds are produced by the\r\nconcourse of the two sexual elements. The modifications which arise\r\nthrough bud-variation can generally be propagated to any extent by\r\ngrafting, budding, cuttings, bulbs, etc., and occasionally even by\r\nseed. Some few of our most beautiful and useful productions have arisen\r\nby bud-variation.\r\n\r\nBud-variations have as yet been observed only in the vegetable kingdom;\r\nbut it is probable that if compound animals, such as corals, etc., had\r\nbeen subjected to a long course of domestication, they would have\r\nvaried by buds; for they resemble plants in many respects. For\r\ninstance, any new or peculiar character presented by a compound animal\r\nis propagated by budding, as occurs with differently coloured Hydras,\r\nand as Mr. Gosse has shown to be the case with a singular variety of a\r\ntrue coral. Varieties of the Hydra have also been grafted on other\r\nvarieties, and have retained their character.\r\n\r\nI will in the first place give all the cases of bud variations which I\r\nhave been able to collect, and afterwards show their importance.[1]\r\nThese cases prove that those authors who, like Pallas, attribute all\r\nvariability to the crossing either of distinct races, or of distinct\r\nindividuals belonging to the same race but somewhat different from each\r\nother, are in error; as are those authors who attribute all variability\r\nto the mere act of sexual union. Nor can we account in all cases for\r\nthe appearance through bud-variation of new characters by the principle\r\nof reversion to long-lost characters. He who wishes to judge how far\r\nthe conditions of life directly cause each particular variation ought\r\nto reflect well on the cases immediately to be given. I will commence\r\nwith bud-variations, as exhibited in the fruit, and then pass on to\r\nflowers, and finally to leaves.\r\n\r\n_Peach (Amygdalus persica)._—In the last chapter I gave two cases of a\r\npeach-almond and a double-flowered almond which suddenly produced fruit\r\nclosely resembling true peaches. I have also given many cases of\r\npeach-trees producing buds, which, when developed into branches, have\r\nyielded nectarines. We have seen that no less than six named and\r\nseveral unnamed varieties of the peach have thus produced several\r\nvarieties of nectarine. I have shown that it is highly improbable that\r\nall these peach-trees, some of which are old varieties, and have been\r\npropagated by the million, are hybrids from the peach and nectarine,\r\nand that it is opposed to all analogy to attribute the occasional\r\nproduction of nectarines on peach-trees to the direct action of pollen\r\nfrom some neighbouring nectarine-tree. Several of the cases are highly\r\nremarkable, because, firstly, the fruit thus produced has sometimes\r\nbeen in part a nectarine and in part a peach; secondly, because\r\nnectarines thus suddenly produced have reproduced themselves by seed;\r\nand thirdly, because nectarines are produced from peach-trees from seed\r\nas well as from buds. The seed of the nectarine, on the other hand,\r\noccasionally produces peaches; and we have seen in one instance that a\r\nnectarine-tree yielded peaches by bud-variation. As the peach is\r\ncertainly the oldest or primary variety, the production of peaches from\r\nnectarines, either by seeds or buds, may perhaps be considered as a\r\ncase of reversion. Certain trees have also been described as\r\nindifferently bearing peaches or nectarines, and this may be considered\r\nas bud-variation carried to an extreme degree.\r\n\r\nThe _grosse mignonne_ peach at Montreuil produced “from a sporting\r\nbranch” the _grosse mignonne tardive,_ “a most excellent variety,”\r\nwhich ripens its fruit a fortnight later than the parent tree, and is\r\nequally good.[2] This same peach has likewise produced by bud-variation\r\nthe _early grosse mignonne._ Hunt’s large tawny nectarine “originated\r\nfrom Hunt’s small tawny nectarine, but not through seminal\r\nreproduction.”[3]\r\n\r\n_Plums._—Mr. Knight states that a tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum,\r\nforty years old, which had always borne ordinary fruit, produced a\r\nbranch which yielded red magnum bonums.[4] Mr. Rivers, of\r\nSawbridgeworth, informs me (Jan. 1863) that a single tree out of 400 or\r\n500 trees of the Early Prolific plum, which is a purple kind, descended\r\nfrom an old French variety bearing purple fruit, produced when about\r\nten years old bright yellow plums; these differed in no respect except\r\ncolour from those on the other trees, but were unlike any other known\r\nkind of yellow plum.[5]\r\n\r\n_Cherry (Prunus cerasus)._—Mr. Knight has recorded (ibid.) the case of\r\na branch of a May-Duke cherry, which, though certainly never grafted,\r\nalways produced fruit, ripening later, and more oblong than the fruit\r\non the other branches. Another account has been given of two May-Duke\r\ncherry-trees in Scotland, with branches bearing oblong and very fine\r\nfruit, which invariably ripened, as in Knight’s case, a fortnight later\r\nthan the other cherries.[6] M. Carrière gives (p. 37) numerous\r\nanalogous cases, and one of the same tree bearing three kinds of fruit.\r\n\r\n_Grapes (Vitis vinifera)._—The black or purple Frontignan in one case\r\nproduced during two successive years (and no doubt permanently), spurs\r\nwhich bore white Frontignan grapes. In another case, on the same\r\nfootstalk, the lower berries “were well-coloured black Frontignans;\r\nthose next the stalk were white, with the exception of one black and\r\none streaked berry;” and altogether there were fifteen black and twelve\r\nwhite berries on the same stalk. In another kind of grape, black and\r\namber-coloured berries were produced in the same cluster.[7] Count\r\nOdart describes a variety which often bears on the same stalk small\r\nround and large oblong berries; though the shape of the berry is\r\ngenerally a fixed character.[8] Here is another striking case given on\r\nthe excellent authority of M. Carrière:[9] “a black Hamburg grape\r\n(Frankenthal) was cut down, and produced three suckers; one of these\r\nwas layered, and after a time produced much smaller berries, which\r\nalways ripened at least a fortnight earlier than the others. Of the\r\nremaining two suckers, one produced every year fine grapes, whilst the\r\nother, although it set an abundance of fruit, matured only a few, and\r\nthese of inferior quality.”\r\n\r\n_Gooseberry (Ribes grossularia)._—A remarkable case has been described\r\nby Dr. Lindley[10] of a bush which bore at the same time no less than\r\nfour kinds of berries, namely, hairy and red,—smooth, small and\r\nred,—green,—and yellow tinged with buff; the two latter kinds had a\r\ndifferent flavour from the red berries, and their seeds were coloured\r\nred. Three twigs on this bush grew close together; the first bore three\r\nyellow berries and one red; the second twig bore four yellow and one\r\nred; and the third four red and one yellow. Mr. Laxton also informs me\r\nthat he has seen a Red Warrington gooseberry bearing both red and\r\nyellow fruit on the same branch.\r\n\r\n_Currant (Ribes rubrum)._—A bush purchased as the Champagne, which is a\r\nvariety that bears blush-coloured fruit intermediate between red and\r\nwhite, produced during fourteen years on separate branches and mingled\r\non the same branch, berries of the red, white, and champagne kinds.[11]\r\nThe suspicion naturally arises that this variety may have originated\r\nfrom a cross between a red and white variety, and that the above\r\ntransformation may be accounted for by reversion to both parent-forms;\r\nbut from the foregoing complex case of the gooseberry this view is\r\ndoubtful. In France, a branch of a red-currant bush, about ten years\r\nold, produced near the summit five white berries) and lower down,\r\namongst the red berries, one berry half red and half white.[12]\r\nAlexander Braun[13] also has often seen branches on white currant-trees\r\nbearing red berries.\r\n\r\n_Pear (Pyrus communis)._—Dureau de la Malle states that the flowers on\r\nsome trees of an ancient variety, the _doyenné galeux,_ were destroyed\r\nby frost: other flowers appeared in July, which produced six pears;\r\nthese exactly resembled in their skin and taste the fruit of a distinct\r\nvariety, the _gros doyenne blanc,_ but in shape were like the\r\n_bon-chrétien_: it was not ascertained whether this new variety could\r\nbe propagated by budding or grafting. The same author grafted a\r\n_bon-chrétien_ on a quince, and it produced, besides its proper fruit,\r\nan apparently new variety, of a peculiar form with thick and rough\r\nskin.[14]\r\n\r\n_Apple (Pyrus malus)._—In Canada, a tree of the variety called Pound\r\nSweet, produced,[15] between two of its proper fruit, an apple which\r\nwas well russeted, small in size, different in shape, and with a short\r\npeduncle. As no russet apple grew anywhere near, this case apparently\r\ncannot be accounted for by the direct action of foreign pollen. M.\r\nCarrière (p. 38) mentions an analogous instance. I shall hereafter give\r\ncases of apple-trees which regularly produce fruit of two kinds, or\r\nhalf-and-half fruit; these trees are generally supposed, and probably\r\nwith truth, to be of crossed parentage, and that the fruit reverts to\r\nboth parent-forms.\r\n\r\n_Banana (Musa sapientium)._—Sir R. Schomburgk states that he saw in St.\r\nDomingo a raceme on the Fig Banana which bore towards the base 125\r\nfruits of the proper kind; and these were succeeded, as is usual,\r\nhigher up the raceme, by barren flowers, and these by 420 fruits,\r\nhaving a widely different appearance, and ripening earlier than the\r\nproper fruit. The abnormal fruit closely resembled, except in being\r\nsmaller, that of the _Musa chinensis_ or _cavendishii,_ which has\r\ngenerally been ranked as a distinct species.[16]\r\n\r\nFlowers.—Many cases have been recorded of a whole plant, or single\r\nbranch, or bud, suddenly producing flowers different from the proper\r\ntype in colour, form, size, doubleness, or other character. Half the\r\nflower, or a smaller segment, sometimes changes colour.\r\n\r\n_Camellia._—The myrtle-leaved species (_C. myrtifolia_), and two or\r\nthree varieties of the common species, have been known to produce\r\nhexagonal and imperfectly quadrangular flowers; and the branches\r\nproducing such flowers have been propagated by grafting.[17] The Pompon\r\nvariety often bears “four distinguishable kinds of flowers,—the pure\r\nwhite and the red-eyed, which appear promiscuously; the brindled pink\r\nand the rose-coloured, which may be kept separate with tolerable\r\ncertainty by grafting from the branches that bear them.” A branch,\r\nalso, on an old tree of the rose-coloured variety has been seen to\r\n“revert to the pure white colour, an occurrence less common than the\r\ndeparture from it.”[18]\r\n\r\n_Cratægus oxyacantha._—A dark pink hawthorn has been known to throw out\r\na single tuft of pure white blossoms;[19] and Mr. A. Clapham,\r\nnurseryman, of Bedford, informs me that his father had a deep crimson\r\nthorn grafted on a white thorn, which during several years, always\r\nbore, high above the graft, bunches of white, pink and deep crimson\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n_Azalea indica_ is well known often to produce new varieties by buds. I\r\nhave myself seen several cases. A plant of _Azalea indica variegata_\r\nhas been exhibited bearing a truss of flowers of A. ind. gledstanesii\r\n“as true as could possibly be produced, thus evidencing the origin of\r\nthat fine variety.” On another plant of _A. ind. variegata_ a perfect\r\nflower of _A. ind. lateritia_ was produced; so that both _\r\ngledstanesii_ and _lateritia_ no doubt originally appeared as sporting\r\nbranches of _A. ind. variegata._[20]\r\n\r\n_Hibiscus (Paritium tricuspis)._—A seedling of this plant, when some\r\nyears old, produced, at Saharunpore,[21] some branches “which bore\r\nleaves and flowers widely different from the normal form.” “The\r\nabnormal leaf is much less divided, and not acuminated. The petals are\r\nconsiderably larger, and quite entire. There is also in the fresh state\r\na conspicuous, large, oblong gland, full of a viscid secretion, on the\r\nback of each of the calycine segments.” Dr. King, who subsequently had\r\ncharge of these Gardens, informs me that a tree of _Paritium tricuspis_\r\n(probably the very same plant) growing there, had a branch buried in\r\nthe ground, apparently by accident; and this branch changed its\r\ncharacter wonderfully, growing like a bush, and producing flowers and\r\nleaves, resembling in shape those of another species, viz., _ P.\r\ntiliaceum._ A small branch springing from this bush near the ground,\r\nreverted to the parent-form. Both forms were extensively propagated\r\nduring several years by cuttings and kept perfectly true.\r\n\r\n_Althæa rosea._—A double yellow Hollyhock suddenly turned one year into\r\na pure white single kind; subsequently a branch bearing the original\r\ndouble yellow flowers reappeared in the midst of the branches of the\r\nsingle white kind.[22]\r\n\r\n_Pelargonium._—These highly cultivated plants seem eminently liable to\r\nbud-variation. I will give only a few well-marked cases. Gärtner has\r\nseen[23] a plant of _P. zonale_ with a branch having white edges, which\r\nremained constant for years, and bore flowers of a deeper red than\r\nusual. Generally speaking, such branches present little or no\r\ndifference in their flowers: thus a writer[24] pinched off the leading\r\nshoot of a seedling _P. zonale,_ and it threw out three branches, which\r\ndiffered in the size and colour of their leaves and stems; but on all\r\nthree branches “the flowers were identical,” except in being largest in\r\nthe green-stemmed variety, and smallest in that with variegated\r\nfoliage: these three varieties were subsequently propagated and\r\ndistributed. Many branches, and some whole plants, of a variety called\r\n_compactum,_ which bears orange-scarlet flowers, have been seen to\r\nproduce pink flowers.[25] Hill’s Hector, which is a pale red variety,\r\nproduced a branch with lilac flowers, and some trusses with both red\r\nand lilac flowers. This apparently is a case of reversion, for Hill’s\r\nHector was a seedling from a lilac variety.[26] Here is a better case\r\nof reversion: a variety produced from a complicated cross, after having\r\nbeen propagated for five generations by seed, yielded by bud-variation\r\nthree very distinct varieties which were undistinguishable from plants,\r\n“known to have been at some time ancestors of the plant in\r\nquestion.”[27] Of all Pelargoniums, Rollisson’s Unique seems to be the\r\nmost sportive; its origin is not positively known, but is believed to\r\nbe from a cross. Mr. Salter, of Hammersmith, states[28] that he has\r\nhimself known this purple variety to produce the lilac, the\r\nrose-crimson or _conspicuum,_ and the red or _coccineum_ varieties; the\r\nlatter has also produced the _rose d’amour_; so that altogether four\r\nvarieties have originated by bud variation from Rollisson’s Unique. Mr.\r\nSalter remarks that these four varieties “may now be considered as\r\nfixed, although they occasionally produce flowers of the original\r\ncolour. This year _ coccineum_ has pushed flowers of three different\r\ncolours, red, rose, and lilac, upon the same truss, and upon other\r\ntrusses are flowers half red and half lilac.” Besides these four\r\nvarieties, two other scarlet Uniques are known to exist, both of which\r\noccasionally produce lilac flowers identical with Rollisson’s\r\nUnique;[29] but one at least of these did not arise through\r\nbud-variation, but is believed to be a seedling from Rollisson’s\r\nUnique.[30] There are, also, in the trade[31] two other slightly\r\ndifferent varieties, of unknown origin, of Rollisson’s Unique: so that\r\naltogether we have a curiously complex case of variation both by buds\r\nand seeds.[32] Here is a still more complex case: M. Rafarin states\r\nthat a pale rose-coloured variety produced a branch bearing deep red\r\nflowers. “Cuttings were taken from this ‘sport,’ from which 20 plants\r\nwere raised, which flowered in 1867, when it was found that scarcely\r\ntwo were alike.” Some resembled the parent-form, some resembled the\r\nsport, some bore both kinds of flowers; and even some of the petals on\r\nthe same flower were rose-coloured and others red.[33] An English wild\r\nplant, the _Geranium pratense,_ when cultivated in a garden, has been\r\nseen to produce on the same plant both blue and white, and striped blue\r\nand white flowers.[34]\r\n\r\n_Chrysanthemum._—This plant frequently sports, both by its lateral\r\nbranches and occasionally by suckers. A seedling raised by Mr. Salter\r\nhas produced by bud-variation six distinct sorts, five different in\r\ncolour and one in foliage, all of which are now fixed.[35] A variety\r\ncalled _cedo nulli_ bears small yellow flowers, but habitually produces\r\nbranches with white flowers; and a specimen was exhibited, which Prof.\r\nT. Dyer saw, before the Horticultural Society. The varieties which were\r\nfirst introduced from China were so excessively variable, “that it was\r\nextremely difficult to tell which was the original colour of the\r\nvariety, and which was the sport.” The same plant would produce one\r\nyear only buff-coloured, and next year only rose-coloured flowers; and\r\nthen would change again, or produce at the same time flowers of both\r\ncolours. These fluctuating varieties are now all lost, and, when a\r\nbranch sports into a new variety, it can generally be propagated and\r\nkept true; but, as Mr. Salter remarks, “every sport should be\r\nthoroughly tested in different soils before it can be really considered\r\nas fixed, as many have been known to run back when planted in rich\r\ncompost; but when sufficient care and time are expended in proving,\r\nthere will exist little danger of subsequent disappointment.” Mr.\r\nSalter informs me that with all the varieties the commonest kind of\r\nbud-variation is the production of yellow flowers, and, as this is the\r\nprimordial colour, these cases may be attributed to reversion. Mr.\r\nSalter has given me a list of seven differently coloured\r\nchrysanthemums, which have all produced branches with yellow flowers;\r\nbut three of them have also sported into other colours. With any change\r\nof colour in the flower, the foliage generally changes in a\r\ncorresponding manner in lightness or darkness.\r\n\r\nAnother Compositous plant, namely, Centauria cyanus, when cultivated in\r\na garden, not unfrequently produces on the same root flowers of four\r\ndifferent colours, viz., blue, white, dark-purple, and\r\nparti-coloured.[36] The flowers of Anthemis also vary on the same\r\nplant.[37]\r\n\r\n_Roses._—Many varieties of the Rose are known or are believed to have\r\noriginated by bud-variation.[38] The common double moss-rose was\r\nimported into England from Italy about the year 1735.[39] Its origin is\r\nunknown, but from analogy it probably arose from the Provence rose (_R.\r\ncentifolia_) by bud-variation; for the branches of the common moss-rose\r\nhave several times been known to produce Provence roses, wholly or\r\npartially destitute of moss: I have seen one such instance, and several\r\nothers have been recorded.[40] Mr. Rivers also informs me that he\r\nraised two or three roses of the Provence class from seed of the old\r\nsingle moss-rose;[41] and this latter kind was produced in 1807 by\r\nbud-variation from the common moss-rose. The white moss-rose was also\r\nproduced in 1788 by an offset from the common red moss-rose: it was at\r\nfirst pale blush-coloured, but became white by continued budding. On\r\ncutting down the shoots which had produced this white moss-rose, two\r\nweak shoots were thrown up, and buds from these yielded the beautiful\r\nstriped moss-rose. The common moss-rose has yielded by bud-variation,\r\nbesides the old single red moss-rose, the old scarlet semi-double\r\nmoss-rose, and the sage-leaf moss-rose, which “has a delicate\r\nshell-like form, and is of a beautiful blush colour; it is now (1852)\r\nnearly extinct.”[42] A white moss-rose has been seen to bear a flower\r\nhalf white and half pink.[43] Although several moss-roses have thus\r\ncertainly arisen by bud-variation, the greater number probably owe\r\ntheir origin to seed of moss-roses. For Mr. Rivers informs me that his\r\nseedlings from the old single moss-rose almost always produced\r\nmoss-roses; and the old single moss-rose was, as we have seen, the\r\nproduct by bud-variation of the double moss-rose originally imported\r\nfrom Italy. That the original moss-rose was the product of\r\nbud-variation is probable, from the facts above given and from the de\r\nMeaux moss-rose (also a variety of _R. centifolia_)[44] having appeared\r\nas a sporting branch on the common rose de Meaux. Prof. Caspary has\r\ncarefully described[45] the case of a six-year-old white moss-rose,\r\nwhich sent up several suckers, one of which was thorny, and produced\r\nred flowers, destitute of moss, exactly like those of the Provence rose\r\n(_R. centifolia_): another shoot bore both kinds of flowers, and in\r\naddition longitudinally striped flowers. As this white moss-rose had\r\nbeen grafted on the Provence rose, Prof. Caspary attributes the above\r\nchanges to the influence of the stock; but from the facts already\r\ngiven, and from others to be given, bud-variation, with reversion, is\r\nprobably a sufficient explanation.\r\n\r\nMany other instances could be added of roses varying by buds. The white\r\nProvence rose apparently originated in this way.[46] M. Carrière states\r\n(p. 36) that he himself knows of five varieties thus produced by the\r\nBaronne Prévost. The double and highly-coloured Belladonna rose has\r\nproduced by suckers both semi-double and almost single white roses;[47]\r\nwhilst suckers from one of these semi-double white roses reverted to\r\nperfectly characterised Belladonnas. In St. Domingo, varieties of the\r\nChina rose propagated by cuttings often revert after a year or two into\r\nthe old China rose.[48] Many cases have been recorded of roses suddenly\r\nbecoming striped or changing their character by segments: some plants\r\nof the Comtesse de Chabrillant, which is properly rose-coloured, were\r\nexhibited in 1862,[49] with crimson flakes on a rose ground. I have\r\nseen the Beauty of Billiard with a quarter and with half the flower\r\nalmost white. ‘The Austrian bramble _R. lutea_ not rarely[50] produces\r\nbranches with pure yellow flowers; and Prof. Henslow has seen exactly\r\nhalf the flower of a pure yellow, and I have seen narrow yellow streaks\r\non a single petal, of which the rest was of the usual copper colour.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are highly remarkable. Mr. Rivers, as I am informed\r\nby him, possessed a new French rose with delicate smooth shoots, pale\r\nglaucous-green leaves, and semi-double pale flesh-coloured flowers\r\nstriped with dark red; and on branches thus characterised there\r\nsuddenly appeared in more than one instance, the famous old rose called\r\nthe Baronne Prevost, with its stout thorny shoots, and immense,\r\nuniformly and richly coloured double flowers; so that in this case the\r\nshoots, leaves, and flowers, all at once changed their character by\r\nbud-variation. According to M. Verlot,[51] a variety called _Rosa\r\ncannabifolia,_ which has peculiarly shaped leaflets, and differs from\r\nevery member of the family in the leaves being opposite instead of\r\nalternate, suddenly appeared on a plant of _R. alba_ in the gardens of\r\nthe Luxembourg. Lastly, “a running shoot” was observed by Mr. H.\r\nCurtis[52] on the old Aimée Vibert Noisette, and he budded it on\r\nCeline; thus a climbing Aimée Vibert was first produced and afterwards\r\npropagated.\r\n\r\n_Dianthus._—It is quite common with the Sweet William (_D. barbatus_)\r\nto see differently coloured flowers on the same root; and I have\r\nobserved on the same truss four differently coloured and shaded\r\nflowers. Carnations and pinks (_D. caryophyllus,_ etc.) occasionally\r\nvary by layers; and some kinds are so little certain in character that\r\nthey are called by floriculturists “catch-flowers.”[53] Mr. Dickson has\r\nably discussed the “running” of particoloured or striped carnations,\r\nand says it cannot be accounted for by the compost in which they are\r\ngrown: “layers from the same clean flower would come part of them clean\r\nand part foul, even when subjected to precisely the same treatment; and\r\nfrequently one flower alone appears influenced by the taint, the\r\nremainder coming perfectly clean.”[54] This running of the\r\nparti-coloured flowers apparently is a case of reversion by buds to the\r\noriginal uniform tint of the species.\r\n\r\nI will briefly mention some other cases of bud-variation to show how\r\nmany plants belonging to many orders have varied in their flowers; and\r\nmany others might be added. I have seen on a snap-dragon (_Antirrhinum\r\nmajus_) white, pink, and striped flowers on the same plant, and\r\nbranches with striped flowers on a red-coloured variety. On a double\r\nstock (_Matthiola incana_) I have seen a branch bearing single flowers;\r\nand on a dingy-purple double variety of the wall-flower (_Cheiranthus\r\ncheiri_), a branch which had reverted to the ordinary copper colour. On\r\nother branches of the same plant, some flowers were exactly divided\r\nacross the middle, one half being purple and the other coppery; but\r\nsome of the smaller petals towards the centre of these same flowers\r\nwere purple longitudinally streaked with coppery colour, or coppery\r\nstreaked with purple. A Cyclamen[55] has been observed to bear white\r\nand pink flowers of two forms, the one resembling the Persicum strain,\r\nand the other the Coum strain. _Oenothera biennis_ has been seen[56]\r\nbearing flowers of three different colours. The hybrid _Gladiolus\r\ncolvilii_ occasionally bears uniformly coloured flowers, and one case\r\nis recorded[57] of all the flowers on a plant thus changing colour. A\r\nFuchsia has been seen[58] bearing two kinds of flowers. _ Mirabilis\r\njalapa_ is eminently sportive, sometimes bearing on the same root pure\r\nred, yellow, and white flowers, and others striped with various\r\ncombinations of these three colours.[59] The plants of the Mirabilis,\r\nwhich bear such extraordinarily variable flowers in most, probably in\r\nall, cases, owe their origin, as shown by Prof. Lecoq, to crosses\r\nbetween differently coloured varieties.\r\n\r\n_Leaves and Shoots._—Changes, through bud-variation, in fruits and\r\nflowers have hitherto been treated of; incidentally some remarkable\r\nmodifications in the leaves and shoots of the rose and Paritium, and in\r\na lesser degree in the foliage of the Pelargonium and Chrysanthemum,\r\nhave been noticed. I will now add a few more cases of variation in\r\nleaf-buds. Verlot[60] states that on _Aralia trifoliata,_ which\r\nproperly has leaves with three leaflets, branches frequently appear\r\nbearing simple leaves of various forms; these can be propagated by buds\r\nor by grafting, and have given rise, as he states, to several nominal\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nWith respect to trees, the history of but few of the many varieties\r\nwith curious or ornamental foliage is known; but several probably have\r\noriginated by bud-variation. Here is one case:—An old ash-tree\r\n(_Fraxinus excelsior_) in the grounds of Necton, as Mr. Mason states,\r\n“for many years has had one bough of a totally different character to\r\nthe rest of the tree, or of any other ash-tree which I have seen; being\r\nshort-jointed and densely covered with foliage.” It was ascertained\r\nthat this variety could be propagated by grafts.[61] The varieties of\r\nsome trees with cut leaves, as the oak-leaved laburnum, the\r\nparsley-leaved vine, and especially the fern-leaved beech, are apt to\r\nrevert by buds to the common forms.[62] The fern-like leaves of the\r\nbeech sometimes revert only partially, and the branches display here\r\nand there sprouts bearing common leaves, fern-like, and variously\r\nshaped leaves. Such cases differ but little from the so-called\r\nheterophyllus varieties, in which the tree habitually bears leaves of\r\nvarious forms; but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees have\r\noriginated as seedlings. There is a sub-variety of the weeping willow\r\nwith leaves rolled up into a spiral coil; and Mr. Masters states that a\r\ntree of this kind kept true in his garden for twenty-five years, and\r\nthen threw out a single upright shoot bearing flat leaves.[63]\r\n\r\nI have often noticed single twigs and branches on beech and other trees\r\nwith their leaves fully expanded before those on the other branches had\r\nopened; and as there was nothing in their exposure or character to\r\naccount for this difference, I presume that they had appeared as\r\nbud-variations, like the early and late fruit-maturing varieties of the\r\npeach and nectarine.\r\n\r\nCryptogamic plants are liable to bud-variation, for fronds on the same\r\nfern often display remarkable deviations of structure. Spores, which\r\nare of the nature of buds, taken from such abnormal fronds, reproduce,\r\nwith remarkable fidelity, the same variety, after passing through the\r\nsexual stage.[64]\r\n\r\nWith respect to colour, leaves often become by bud-variation zoned,\r\nblotched, or spotted with white, yellow, and red; and this occasionally\r\noccurs even with plants in a state of nature. Variegation, however,\r\nappears still more frequently in plants produced from seed; even the\r\ncotyledons or seed-leaves being thus affected.[65] There have been\r\nendless disputes whether variegation should be considered as a disease.\r\nIn a future chapter we shall see that it is much influenced, both in\r\nthe case of seedlings and of mature plants, by the nature of the soil.\r\nPlants which have become variegated as seedlings, generally transmit\r\ntheir character by seed to a large proportion of their progeny; and Mr.\r\nSalter has given me a list of eight genera in which this occurred.[66]\r\nSir F. Pollock has given me more precise information: he sowed seed\r\nfrom a variegated plant of _Ballota nigra_ which was found growing\r\nwild, and thirty per cent of the seedlings were variegated; seed from\r\nthese latter being sown, sixty per cent came up variegated. When\r\nbranches become variegated by bud-variation, and the variety is\r\nattempted to be propagated by seed, the seedlings are rarely\r\nvariegated: Mr. Salter found this to be the case with plants belonging\r\nto eleven genera, in which the greater number of the seedlings proved\r\nto be green-leaved; yet a few were slightly variegated, or were quite\r\nwhite, but none were worth keeping. Variegated plants, whether\r\noriginally produced from seeds or buds, can generally be propagated by\r\nbudding, grafting, etc.; but all are apt to revert by bud-variation to\r\ntheir ordinary foliage. This tendency, however, differs much in the\r\nvarieties of even the same species; for instance, the golden-striped\r\nvariety of _Euonymus japonicus_ “is very liable to run back to the\r\ngreen-leaved, while the silver-striped variety hardly ever\r\nchanges.”[67] I have seen a variety of the holly, with its leaves\r\nhaving a central yellow patch, which had everywhere partially reverted\r\nto the ordinary foliage, so that on the same small branch there were\r\nmany twigs of both kinds. In the pelargonium, and in some other plants,\r\nvariegation is generally accompanied by some degree of dwarfing, as is\r\nwell exemplified in the “Dandy” pelargonium. When such dwarf varieties\r\nsport back by buds or suckers to the ordinary foliage, the dwarfed\r\nstature still remains.[68] It is remarkable that plants propagated from\r\nbranches which have reverted from variegated to plain leaves[69] do not\r\nalways (or never, as one observer asserts) perfectly resemble the\r\noriginal plain-leaved plant from which the variegated branch arose: it\r\nseems that a plant, in passing by bud-variation from plain leaves to\r\nvariegated, and back again from variegated to plain, is generally in\r\nsome degree affected so as to assume a slightly different aspect.\r\n\r\n_Bud-variation by Suckers, Tubers, and Bulbs._—All the cases hitherto\r\ngiven of bud-variation in fruits, flowers, leaves, and shoots, have\r\nbeen confined to buds on the stems or branches, with the exception of a\r\nfew cases incidentally noticed of varying suckers in the rose,\r\npelargonium, and chrysanthemum. I will now give a few instances of\r\nvariation in subterranean buds, that is, by suckers, tubers, and bulbs;\r\nnot that there is any essential difference between buds above and\r\nbeneath the ground. Mr. Salter informs me that two variegated varieties\r\nof Phlox originated as suckers; but I should not have thought these\r\nworth mentioning, had not Mr. Salter found, after repeated trials, that\r\nhe could not propagate them by “root-joints,” whereas, the variegated\r\n_Tussilago farfara_ can thus be safely propagated;[70] but this latter\r\nplant may have originated as a variegated seedling, which would account\r\nfor its greater fixedness of character. The Barberry (_Berberis\r\nvulgaris_) offers an analogous case; there is a well-known variety with\r\nseedless fruit, which can be propagated by cuttings or layers; but\r\nsuckers always revert to the common form, which produces fruit\r\ncontaining seeds.[71] My father repeatedly tried this experiment, and\r\nalways with the same result. I may here mention that maize and wheat\r\nsometimes produce new varieties from the stock or root, as does the\r\nsugar-cane.[72]\r\n\r\nTurning now to tubers: in the common Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) a\r\nsingle bud or eye sometimes varies and produces a new variety; or,\r\noccasionally, and this is a much more remarkable circumstance, all the\r\neyes in a tuber vary in the same manner and at the same time, so that\r\nthe whole tuber assumes a new character. For instance, a single eye in\r\na tuber of the old _Forty-fold potato,_ which is a purple variety, was\r\nobserved[73] to become white; this eye was cut out and planted\r\nseparately, and the kind has since been largely propagated. _Kemp’s\r\npotato_ is properly white, but a plant in Lancashire produced two\r\ntubers which were red, and two which were white; the red kind was\r\npropagated in the usual manner by eyes, and kept true to its new\r\ncolour, and, being found a more productive variety, soon became widely\r\nknown under the name of _ Taylor’s forty-fold._[74] The old _Forty-fold\r\npotato,_ as already stated, is a purple variety; but a plant long\r\ncultivated on the same ground produced, not, as in the case above\r\ngiven, a single white eye, but a whole white tuber, which has since\r\nbeen propagated and keeps true.[75] Several cases have been recorded of\r\nlarge portions of whole rows of potatoes slightly changing their\r\ncharacter.[76]\r\n\r\nDahlias propagated by tubers under the hot climate of St. Domingo vary\r\nmuch; Sir R. Schomburgk gives the case of the “Butterfly variety,”\r\nwhich the second year produced on the same plant “double and single\r\nflowers; here white petals edged with maroon; there of a uniform deep\r\nmaroon.”[77] Mr. Bree also mentions a plant “which bore two different\r\nkinds of self-coloured flowers, as well as a third kind which partook\r\nof both colours beautifully intermixed.”[78] Another case is described\r\nof a dahlia with purple flowers which bore a white flower streaked with\r\npurple.[79]\r\n\r\nConsidering how long and extensively many Bulbous plants have been\r\ncultivated, and how numerous are the varieties produced from seed,\r\nthese plants have not perhaps varied so much by offsets,—that is, by\r\nthe production of new bulbs,—as might have been expected. With the\r\nHyacinth, however, several instances have been given by M. Carrière. A\r\ncase also has been recorded of a blue variety which for three\r\nsuccessive years gave offsets producing white flowers with a red\r\ncentre.[80] Another hyacinth bore[81] on the same truss a perfectly\r\npink and a perfectly blue flower. I have seen a bulb producing at the\r\nsame time one stalk or truss with fine blue flowers, another with fine\r\nred flowers, and a third with blue flowers on one side and red on the\r\nother; several of the flowers being also longitudinally striped red and\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nMr. John Scott informs me that in 1862 _Imatophyllum miniatum,_ in the\r\nBotanic Gardens of Edinburgh, threw up a sucker which differed from the\r\nnormal form, in the leaves being two-ranked instead of four-ranked. The\r\nleaves were also smaller, with the upper surface raised instead of\r\nbeing channelled.\r\n\r\nIn the propagation of _Tulips,_ seedlings are raised, called _selfs_ or\r\n_breeders,_ which, “consist of one plain colour on a white or yellow\r\nbottom. These, being cultivated on a dry and rather poor soil, become\r\nbroken or variegated and produce new varieties. The time that elapses\r\nbefore they break varies from one to twenty years or more, and\r\nsometimes this change never takes place.”[82] The broken or variegated\r\ncolours which give value to all tulips are due to bud-variation; for\r\nalthough the Bybloemens and some other kinds have been raised from\r\nseveral distinct breeders, yet all the Baguets are said to have come\r\nfrom a single breeder or seedling. This bud-variation, in accordance\r\nwith the views of MM. Vilmorin and Verlot,[83] is probably an attempt\r\nto revert to that uniform colour which is natural to the species. A\r\ntulip, however, which has already become broken, when treated with too\r\nstrong manure, is liable to flush or lose by a second act of reversion\r\nits variegated colours. Some kinds, as Imperatrix Florum, are much more\r\nliable than others to flushing; and Mr. Dickson maintains[84] that this\r\ncan no more be accounted for than the variation of any other plant. He\r\nbelieves that English growers, from care in choosing seed from broken\r\nflowers instead of from plain flowers, have to a certain extent\r\ndiminished the tendency in flowers already broken to flushing or\r\nsecondary reversion. _Iris xiphium,_ according to M. Carrière (p. 65),\r\nbehaves in nearly the same manner, as do so many tulips.\r\n\r\nDuring two consecutive years all the early flowers in a bed of\r\n_Tigridia conchiflora_[85] resembled those of the old _T. pavonia_; but\r\nthe later flowers assumed their proper colour of fine yellow, spotted\r\nwith crimson. An apparently authentic account has been published[86] of\r\ntwo forms of Hemerocallis, which have been universally considered as\r\ndistinct species, changing into each other; for the roots of the\r\nlarge-flowered tawny _H. fulva,_ being divided and planted in a\r\ndifferent soil and place, produced the small-flowered _H. flava,_ as\r\nwell as some intermediate forms. It is doubtful whether such cases as\r\nthese latter, as well as the “flushing” of broken tulips and the\r\n“running” of particoloured carnations,—that is, their more or less\r\ncomplete return to a uniform tint,—ought to be classed under\r\nbud-variation, or ought to be retained for the chapter in which I treat\r\nof the direct action of the conditions of life on organic beings. These\r\ncases, however, have this much in bud-variation, that the change is\r\neffected through buds and not through seminal reproduction. But, on the\r\nother hand, there is this difference—that in ordinary cases of\r\nbud-variation, one bud alone changes, whilst in the foregoing cases all\r\nthe buds on the same plant were modified together. With the potato, we\r\nhave seen an intermediate case, for all the eyes in one tuber\r\nsimultaneously changed their character.\r\n\r\nI will conclude with a few allied cases, which may be ranked either\r\nunder bud-variation, or under the direct action of the conditions of\r\nlife. When the common Hepatica is transplanted from its native woods,\r\nthe flowers change colour, even during the first year.[87] It is\r\nnotorious that the improved varieties of the Heartsease (_Viola\r\ntricolor_), when transplanted, often produce flowers widely different\r\nin size, form, and colour: for instance, I transplanted a large\r\nuniformly-coloured dark purple variety, whilst in full flower, and it\r\nthen produced much smaller, more elongated flowers, with the lower\r\npetals yellow; these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple\r\nspots, and ultimately, towards the end of the same summer, by the\r\noriginal large dark purple flowers. The slight changes which some\r\nfruit-trees undergo from being grafted and regrafted on various\r\nstocks,[88] were considered by Andrew Knight[89] as closely allied to\r\n“sporting branches,” or bud-variations. Again, we have the case of\r\nyoung fruit-trees changing their character as they grow old; seedling\r\npears, for instance, lose with age their spines and improve in the\r\nflavour of their fruit. Weeping birch-trees, when grafted on the common\r\nvariety, do not acquire a perfect pendulous habit until they grow old:\r\non the other hand, I shall hereafter give the case of some weeping\r\nashes which slowly and gradually assumed an upright habit of growth.\r\nAll such changes, dependent on age, may be compared with the changes,\r\nalluded to in the last chapter, which many trees naturally undergo; as\r\nin the case of the Deodar and Cedar of Lebanon, which are unlike in\r\nyouth, whilst they closely resemble each other in old age; and as with\r\ncertain oaks, and with some varieties of the lime and hawthorn.[90]\r\n\r\n_Graft-hybrids._—Before giving a summary on Bud-variation I will\r\ndiscuss some singular and anomalous cases, which are more or less\r\nclosely related to this same subject. I will begin with the famous case\r\nof Adam’s laburnum or _Cytisus adami,_ a form or hybrid intermediate\r\nbetween two very distinct species, namely, _C. laburnum_ and\r\n_purpureus,_ the common and purple laburnum; but as this tree has often\r\nbeen described, I will be as brief as I can.\r\n\r\nThroughout Europe, in different soils and under different climates,\r\nbranches on this tree have repeatedly and suddenly reverted to the two\r\nparent species in their flowers and leaves. To behold mingled on the\r\nsame tree tufts of dingy-red, bright yellow, and purple flowers, borne\r\non branches having widely different leaves and manner of growth, is a\r\nsurprising sight. The same raceme sometimes bears two kinds of flowers;\r\nand I have seen a single flower exactly divided into halves, one side\r\nbeing bright yellow and the other purple; so that one half of the\r\nstandard-petal was yellow and of larger size, and the other half purple\r\nand smaller. In another flower the whole corolla was bright yellow, but\r\nexactly half the calyx was purple. In another, one of the dingy-red\r\nwing-petals had a narrow bright yellow stripe on it; and lastly, in\r\nanother flower, one of the stamens, which had become slightly\r\nfoliaceous, was half yellow and half purple; so that the tendency to\r\nsegregation of character or reversion affects even single parts and\r\norgans.[91] The most remarkable fact about this tree is that in its\r\nintermediate state, even when growing near both parent-species, it is\r\nquite sterile; but when the flowers become pure yellow or pure purple\r\nthey yield seed. I believe that the pods from the yellow flowers yield\r\na full complement of seed; they certainly yield a larger number. Two\r\nseedlings raised by Mr. Herbert from such seed[92] exhibited a purple\r\ntinge on the stalks of their flowers; but several seedlings raised by\r\nmyself resembled in every character the common laburnum, with the\r\nexception that some of them had remarkably long racemes: these\r\nseedlings were perfectly fertile. That such purity of character and\r\nfertility should be suddenly reacquired from so hybridised and sterile\r\na form is an astonishing phenomenon. The branches with purple flowers\r\nappear at first sight exactly to resemble those of _C. purpureus_; but\r\non careful comparison I found that they differed from the pure species\r\nin the shoots being thicker, the leaves a little broader, and the\r\nflowers slightly shorter, with the corolla and calyx less brightly\r\npurple: the basal part of the standard-petal also plainly showed a\r\ntrace of the yellow stain. So that the flowers, at least in this\r\ninstance, had not perfectly recovered their true character; and in\r\naccordance with this, they were not perfectly fertile, for many of the\r\npods contained no seed, some produced one, and very few contained as\r\nmany as two seeds; whilst numerous pods on a tree of the pure _C.\r\npurpureus_ in my garden contained three, four, and five fine seeds. The\r\npollen, moreover, was very imperfect, a multitude of grains being small\r\nand shrivelled; and this is a singular fact; for, as we shall\r\nimmediately see, the pollen-grains in the dingy-red and sterile flowers\r\non the parent-tree, were, in external appearance, in a much better\r\nstate, and included very few shrivelled grains. Although the pollen of\r\nthe reverted purple flowers was in so poor a condition, the ovules were\r\nwell formed, and the seeds, when mature, germinated freely with me. Mr.\r\nHerbert raised plants from seeds of the reverted purple flowers, and\r\nthey differed a _very little_ from the usual state of _C. purpureus._\r\nSome which I raised in the same manner did not differ at all, either in\r\nthe character of their flowers or of the whole bush, from the pure _C.\r\npurpureus._\r\n\r\nProf. Caspary has examined the ovules of the dingy-red and sterile\r\nflowers in several plants of _C. adami_ on the Continent,[93] and finds\r\nthem generally monstrous. In three plants examined by me in England,\r\nthe ovules were likewise monstrous, the nucleus varying much in shape,\r\nand projecting irregularly beyond the proper coats. The pollen grains,\r\non the other hand, judging from their external appearance, were\r\nremarkably good, and readily protruded their tubes. By repeatedly\r\ncounting, under the microscope, the proportional number of bad grains,\r\nProf. Caspary ascertained that only 2·5 per cent were bad, which is a\r\nless proportion than in the pollen of three pure species of Cytisus in\r\ntheir cultivated state, viz., _C. purpureus, laburnum,_ and _alpinus._\r\nAlthough the pollen of _C. adami_ is thus in appearance good, it does\r\nnot follow, according to M. Naudin’s observation[94] on Mirabilis, that\r\nit would be functionally effective. The fact of the ovules of _C.\r\nadami_ being monstrous, and the pollen apparently sound, is all the\r\nmore remarkable, because it is opposed to what usually occurs not only\r\nwith most hybrids,[95] but with two hybrids in the same genus, namely\r\nin _C. purpureo-elongatus,_ and _C. alpino-laburnum._ In both these\r\nhybrids, the ovules, as observed by Prof. Caspary and myself, were\r\nwell-formed, whilst many of the pollen-grains were ill-formed; in the\r\nlatter hybrid 20.3 per cent, and in the former no less than 84·8 per\r\ncent of the grains were ascertained by Prof. Caspary to be bad. This\r\nunusual condition of the male and female reproductive elements in _C.\r\nadami_ has been used by Prof. Caspary as an argument against this plant\r\nbeing considered as an ordinary hybrid produced from seed; but we\r\nshould remember that with hybrids the ovules have not been examined\r\nnearly so frequently as the pollen, and they may be much oftener\r\nimperfect than is generally supposed. Dr. E. Bornet, of Antibes,\r\ninforms me (through Mr. J. Traherne Moggridge) that with hybrid Cisti\r\nthe ovarium is frequently deformed, the ovules being in some cases\r\nquite absent, and in other cases incapable of fertilisation.\r\n\r\nSeveral theories have been propounded to account for the origin of _C.\r\nadami,_ and for the transformations which it undergoes. The whole case\r\nhas been attributed by some authors to bud-variation; but considering\r\nthe wide difference between _C. laburnum_ and _purpureus,_ both of\r\nwhich are natural species, and considering the sterility of the\r\nintermediate form, this view may be summarily rejected. We shall\r\npresently see that, with hybrid plants, two embryos differing in their\r\ncharacters may be developed within the same seed and cohere; and it has\r\nbeen supposed that _C. adami_ thus originated. Many botanists maintain\r\nthat _C. adami_ is a hybrid produced in the common way by seed, and\r\nthat it has reverted by buds to its two parent-forms. Negative results\r\nare not of much value; but Reisseck, Caspary, and myself, tried in vain\r\nto cross _C. laburnum_ and _purpureus_; when I fertilised the former\r\nwith pollen of the latter, I had the nearest approach to success, for\r\npods were formed, but in sixteen days after the withering of the\r\nflowers, they fell off. Nevertheless, the belief that _C. adami_ is a\r\nspontaneously produced hybrid between these two species is supported by\r\nthe fact that such hybrids have arisen in this genus. In a bed of\r\nseedlings from _C. elongatus,_ which grew near to _C. purpureus,_ and\r\nwas probably fertilised by it through the agency of insects (for these,\r\nas I know by experiment, play an important part in the fertilisation of\r\nthe laburnum), the sterile hybrid _C. purpureo-elongatus_ appeared.[96]\r\nThus, also, Waterer’s laburnum, the _C. alpino-laburnum,_[97]\r\nspontaneously appeared, as I am informed by Mr. Waterer, in a bed of\r\nseedlings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have a clear and distinct account given to\r\nPoiteau,[98] by M. Adam, who raised the plant, showing that _C. adami_\r\nis not an ordinary hybrid; but is what may be called a graft-hybrid,\r\nthat is, one produced from the united cellular tissue of two distinct\r\nspecies. M. Adam inserted in the usual manner a shield of the bark of\r\n_C. purpureus_ into a stock of _C. laburnum_; and the bud lay dormant,\r\nas often happens, for a year; the shield then produced many buds and\r\nshoots, one of which grew more upright and vigorous with larger leaves\r\nthan the shoots of _C. purpureus,_ and was consequently propagated. Now\r\nit deserves especial notice that these plants were sold by M. Adam, as\r\na variety of _C. purpureus,_ before they had flowered; and the account\r\nwas published by Poiteau after the plants had flowered, but before they\r\nhad exhibited their remarkable tendency to revert into the two parent\r\nspecies. So that there was no conceivable motive for falsification, and\r\nit is difficult to see how there could have been any error.[99] If we\r\nadmit as true M. Adam’s account, we must admit the extraordinary fact\r\nthat two distinct species can unite by their cellular tissue, and\r\nsubsequently produce a plant bearing leaves and sterile flowers\r\nintermediate in character between the scion and stock, and producing\r\nbuds liable to reversion; in short, resembling in every important\r\nrespect a hybrid formed in the ordinary way by seminal reproduction.\r\n\r\nI will therefore give all the facts which I have been able to collect\r\non the formation of hybrids between distinct species or varieties,\r\nwithout the intervention of the sexual organs. For if, as I am now\r\nconvinced, this is possible, it is a most important fact, which will\r\nsooner or later change the views held by physiologists with respect to\r\nsexual reproduction. A sufficient body of facts will afterwards be\r\nadduced, showing that the segregation or separation of the characters\r\nof the two parent-forms by bud-variation, as in the case of _Cytisus\r\nadami,_ is not an unusual though a striking phenomenon. We shall\r\nfurther see that a whole bud may thus revert, or only half, or some\r\nsmaller segment.\r\n\r\nThe famous _bizzarria Orange_ offers a strictly parallel case to that\r\nof _Cytisus adami._ The gardener who in 1644 in Florence raised this\r\ntree, declared that it was a seedling which had been grafted; and after\r\nthe graft had perished, the stock sprouted and produced the bizzarria.\r\nGallesio, who carefully examined several living specimens and compared\r\nthem with the description given by the original describer, P.\r\nNato,[100] states that the tree produces at the same time leaves,\r\nflowers, and fruit identical with the bitter orange and with the citron\r\nof Florence, and likewise compound fruit, with the two kinds either\r\nblended together, both externally and internally, or segregated in\r\nvarious ways. This tree can be propagated by cuttings, and retains its\r\ndiversified character. The so-called trifacial orange of Alexandria and\r\nSmyrna[101] resembles in its general nature the bizzarria, and differs\r\nonly in the orange being of the sweet kind; this and the citron are\r\nblended together in the same fruit, or are separately produced on the\r\nsame tree; nothing is known of its origin. In regard to the bizzarria,\r\nmany authors believe that it is a graft-hybrid; Gallesio, on the other\r\nhand, thinks that it is an ordinary hybrid, with the habit of partially\r\nreverting by buds to the two parent-forms; and we have seen that the\r\nspecies in this genus often cross spontaneously.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that when the variegated Jessamine is budded on the\r\ncommon kind, the stock sometimes produces buds bearing variegated\r\nleaves: Mr. Rivers, as he informs me, has seen instances of this. The\r\nsame thing occurs with the Oleander.[102] Mr. Rivers, on the authority\r\nof a trustworthy friend, states that some buds of a golden-variegated\r\nash, which were inserted into common ashes, all died except one; but\r\nthe ash-stocks were affected,[103] and produced, both above and below\r\nthe points of insertion of the plates of bark bearing the dead buds,\r\nshoots which bore variegated leaves. Mr. J. Anderson Henry has\r\ncommunicated to me a nearly similar case: Mr. Brown, of Perth, observed\r\nmany years ago, in a Highland glen, an ash-tree with yellow leaves; and\r\nbuds taken from this tree were inserted into common ashes, which in\r\nconsequence were affected, and produced the _Blotched Breadalbane Ash._\r\nThis variety has been propagated, and has preserved its character\r\nduring the last fifty years. Weeping ashes, also, were budded on the\r\naffected stocks, and became similarly variegated. It has been\r\nrepeatedly proved that several species of Abutilon, on which the\r\nvariegated _A. thompsonii_ has been grafted, become variegated.[104]\r\n\r\nMany authors consider variegation as the result of disease; and the\r\nforegoing cases may be looked at as the direct result of the\r\ninoculation of a disease or some weakness. This has been almost proved\r\nto be the case by Morren in the excellent paper just referred to, who\r\nshows that even a leaf inserted by its footstalk into the bark of the\r\nstock is sufficient to communicate variegation to it, though the leaf\r\nsoon perishes. Even fully formed leaves on the stock of Abutilon are\r\nsometimes affected by the graft and become variegated. Variegation is\r\nmuch influenced, as we shall hereafter see, by the nature of the soil\r\nin which the plants are grown; and it does not seem improbable that\r\nwhatever change in the sap or tissues certain soils induce, whether or\r\nnot called a disease, might spread from the inserted piece of bark to\r\nthe stock. But a change of this kind cannot be considered to be of the\r\nnature of a graft-hybrid.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of the hazel with dark-purple leaves, like those of\r\nthe copper-beech: no one has attributed this colour to disease, and it\r\napparently is only an exaggeration of a tint which may often be seen on\r\nthe leaves of the common hazel. When this variety is grafted on the\r\ncommon hazel,[105] it sometimes colours, as has been asserted, the\r\nleaves below the graft; although negative evidence is not of much\r\nvalue, I may add that Mr. Rivers, who has possessed hundreds of such\r\ngrafted trees, has never seen an instance.\r\n\r\nGärtner[106] quotes two separate accounts of branches of dark and\r\nwhite-fruited vines which had been united in various ways, such as\r\nbeing split longitudinally, and then joined, etc.; and these branches\r\nproduced distinct bunches of grapes of the two colours, and other\r\nbunches with berries, either striped, or of an intermediate and new\r\ntint. Even the leaves in one case were variegated. These facts are the\r\nmore remarkable because Andrew Knight never succeeded in raising\r\nvariegated grapes by fertilising white kinds by pollen of dark kinds;\r\nthough, as we have seen, he obtained seedlings with variegated fruits\r\nand leaves, by fertilising a white variety by the already variegated\r\ndark Aleppo grape. Gärtner attributes the above-quoted cases merely to\r\nbud-variation; but it is a strange coincidence that the branches which\r\nhad been grafted in a peculiar manner should alone thus have varied;\r\nand H. Adorne de Tscharner positively asserts that he produced the\r\ndescribed result more than once, and could do so at will, by splitting\r\nand uniting the branches in the manner described by him.\r\n\r\nI should not have quoted the following case had not the author of ‘Des\r\nJacinthes’[107] impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive\r\nknowledge, but of his truthfulness: he says that bulbs of blue and red\r\nhyacinths may be cut in two, and that they will grow together and throw\r\nup a united stem (and this I have myself seen) with flowers of the two\r\ncolours on the opposite sides. But the remarkable point is, that\r\nflowers are sometimes produced with the two colours blended together,\r\nwhich makes the case closely analogous with that of the blended colours\r\nof the grapes on the united vine branches.\r\n\r\nIn the case of roses it is supposed that several graft-hybrids have\r\nbeen formed, but there is much doubt about these cases, owing to the\r\nfrequency of ordinary bud-variations. The most trustworthy instance\r\nknown to me is one, recorded by Mr. Poynter,[108] who assures me in a\r\nletter of the entire accuracy of the statement. _ Rosa devoniensis_ had\r\nbeen budded some years previously on a white Banksian rose; and from\r\nthe much enlarged point of junction, whence the Devoniensis and\r\nBanksian still continued to grow, a third branch issued, which was\r\nneither pure Banksian nor pure Devoniensis, but partook of the\r\ncharacter of both; the flowers resembled, but were superior in\r\ncharacter to those of the variety called _Lamarque_ (one of the\r\nNoisettes), while the shoots were similar in their manner of growth to\r\nthose of the Banksian rose, with the exception that the longer and more\r\nrobust shoots were furnished with prickles. This rose was exhibited\r\nbefore the Floral Committee of the Horticultural Society of London. Dr.\r\nLindley examined it and concluded that it had certainly been produced\r\nby the mingling of _R. banksiæ_ with some rose like _R. devoniensis,_\r\n“for while it was very greatly increased in vigour and in size of all\r\nthe parts, the leaves were half-way between a Banksian and Tea-scented\r\nrose.” It appears that rose-growers were previously aware that the\r\nBanksian rose sometimes affects other roses. As Mr. Poynter’s new\r\nvariety is intermediate in its fruit and foliage between the stock and\r\nscion, and as it arose from the point of junction between the two, it\r\nis very improbable that it owes its origin to mere bud-variation,\r\nindependently of the mutual influence of the stock and scion.\r\n\r\nLastly, with respect to potatoes. Mr. R. Trail stated in 1867 before\r\nthe Botanical Society of Edinburgh (and has since given me fuller\r\ninformation), that several years ago he cut about sixty blue and white\r\npotatoes into halves through the eyes or buds, and then carefully\r\njoined them, destroying at the same time the other eyes. Some of these\r\nunited tubers produced white, and others blue tubers; some, however,\r\nproduced tubers partly white and partly blue; and the tubers from about\r\nfour or five were regularly mottled with the two colours. In these\r\nlatter cases we may conclude that a stem had been formed by the union\r\nof the bisected buds, that is, by graft-hybridisation.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Botanische Zeitung’ (May 16, 1868), Professor Hildebrand gives\r\nan account with a coloured figure, of his experiments on two varieties\r\nwhich were found during the same season to be constant in character,\r\nnamely, a somewhat elongated rough-skinned red potato and a rounded\r\nsmooth white one. He inserted buds reciprocally into both kinds,\r\ndestroying the other buds. He thus raised two plants, and each of these\r\nproduced a tuber intermediate in character between the two\r\nparent-forms. That from the red bud grafted into the white tuber, was\r\nat one end red and rough, as the whole tuber ought to have been if not\r\naffected; in the middle it was smooth with red stripes, and at the\r\nother end smooth and altogether white like that of the stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor, who had received several accounts of potatoes having been\r\ngrafted by wedge-shaped pieces of one variety inserted into another,\r\nthough sceptical on the subject, made twenty-four experiments which he\r\ndescribed in detail before the Horticultural Society.[109] He thus\r\nraised many new varieties, some like the graft or like the stock;\r\nothers having an intermediate character. Several persons witnessed the\r\ndigging up of the tubers from these graft-hybrids; and one of them, Mr.\r\nJameson, a large dealer in potatoes, writes thus, “They were such a\r\nmixed lot, as I have never before or since seen. They were of all\r\ncolours and shapes, some very ugly and some very handsome.” Another\r\nwitness says “some were round, some kidney, pink-eyed kidney, piebald,\r\nand mottled red and purple, of all shapes and sizes.” Some of these\r\nvarieties have been found valuable, and have been extensively\r\npropagated. Mr. Jameson took away a large piebald potato which he cut\r\ninto five sets and propagated; these yielded round, white, red, and\r\npiebald potatoes.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzpatrick followed a different plan;[110] he grafted together not\r\nthe tubers but the young stems of varieties producing black, white, and\r\nred potatoes. The tubers borne by three of these twin or united plants\r\nwere coloured in an extraordinary manner; one was almost exactly half\r\nblack and half white, so that some persons on seeing it thought that\r\ntwo potatoes had been divided and rejoined; other tubers were half red\r\nand half white, or curiously mottled with red and white, or with red\r\nand black, according to the colours of the graft and stock.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mr. Fenn is of much value, as he is “a well known\r\npotato-grower” who has raised many new varieties by crossing different\r\nkinds in the ordinary manner. He considers it “demonstrated” that new,\r\nintermediate varieties can be produced by grafting the tubers, though\r\nhe doubts whether such will prove valuable.[111] He made many trials\r\nand laid the results, exhibiting specimens, before the Horticultural\r\nSociety. Not only were the tubers affected, some being smooth and white\r\nat one end and rough and red at the other, but the stems and leaves\r\nwere modified in their manner of growth, colour and precocity. Some of\r\nthese graft-hybrids after being propagated for three years still showed\r\nin their haulms their new character, different from that of the kind\r\nfrom which the eyes had been taken. Mr. Fenn gave twelve of the tubers\r\nof the third generation to Mr. Alex. Dean, who grew them, and was thus\r\nconverted into a believer in graft-hybridisation, having previously\r\nbeen a complete sceptic. For comparison he planted the pure\r\nparent-forms alongside the twelve tubers; and found that many of the\r\nplants from the latter[112] were intermediate between the two\r\nparent-forms in precocity, in the tallness, uprightness, jointing, and\r\nrobustness of the stems, and in the size and colour of the leaves.\r\n\r\nAnother experimentalist, Mr. Rintoul, grafted no less than fifty-nine\r\ntubers, which differed in shape (some being kidneys) in smoothness and\r\ncolour,[113] and many of the plants thus raised “were intermediate in\r\nthe tubers as well as in the haulms.” He describes the more striking\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 I received a letter from Mr. Merrick, of Boston, U.S.A., who\r\nstates that, “Mr. Fearing Burr, a very careful experimenter and author\r\nof a much valued book, ‘The Garden Vegetables of America’ has succeeded\r\nin producing distinctly mottled and most curious potatoes—evidently\r\ngraft-hybrids, by inserting eyes from blue or red potatoes into the\r\nsubstance of white ones, after removing the eyes of the latter. I have\r\nseen the potatoes, and they are very curious.”\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the experiments made in Germany, since the\r\npublication of Prof. Hildebrand’s paper. Herr Magnus relates[114] the\r\nresults of numerous trials made by Herren Reuter and Lindemuth, both\r\nattached to the Royal Gardens of Berlin. They inserted the eyes of red\r\npotatoes into white ones, and _vice versa._ Many different forms\r\npartaking of the characters of the inserted bud and of the stock were\r\nthus obtained; for instance, some of the tubers were white with red\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHerr Magnus also exhibited in the following year before the same\r\nSociety (Nov. 19, 1872), the produce of grafts between black, white,\r\nand red potatoes, made by Dr. Neubert. These were made by uniting not\r\nthe tubers but the young stems, as was done by Mr. Fitzpatrick. The\r\nresult was remarkable, inasmuch as all the tubers thus produced were\r\nintermediate in character, though in a variable degree. Those between\r\nthe black and the white or the red were the most striking in\r\nappearance. Some from between the white and red had one half of one\r\ncolour and the other half of the other colour.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting of the society Herr Magnus communicated the results\r\nof Dr. Heimann’s experiments in grafting together the tubers of red\r\nSaxon, blue, and elongated white potatoes. The eyes were removed by a\r\ncylindrical instrument, and inserted into corresponding holes in other\r\nvarieties. The plants thus produced yielded a great number of tubers,\r\nwhich were intermediate between the two parent-forms in shape, and in\r\nthe colour both of the flesh and skin.\r\n\r\nHerr Reuter experimented,[115] by inserting wedges of the elongated\r\nWhite Mexican potato into a Black Kidney potato. Both sorts are known\r\nto be very constant, and differ much not only in form and colour, but\r\nin the eyes of the Black Kidney being deeply sunk, whereas those of the\r\nWhite Mexican are superficial and of a different shape. The tubers\r\nproduced by these hybrids were intermediate in colour and form; and\r\nsome which resembled in form the graft, _i.e._ the Mexican, had eyes\r\ndeeply sunk and of the same shape as in the stock or Black Kidney.\r\n\r\nAny one who will attentively consider the abstract now given, of the\r\nexperiments made by many observers in several countries, will, I think,\r\nbe convinced that by grafting two varieties of the potato together in\r\nvarious ways, hybridised plants can be produced. It should be observed\r\nthat several of the experimentalists are scientific horticulturists,\r\nand some of them potato-growers on a large scale, who, though\r\nbeforehand sceptical, have been fully convinced of the possibility,\r\neven of the ease, of making graft-hybrids. The only way of escaping\r\nfrom this conclusion is to attribute all the many recorded cases to\r\nsimple bud-variation. Undoubtedly the potato, as we have seen in this\r\nchapter, does sometimes, though not often, vary by buds; but it should\r\nbe especially noted that it is experienced potato-growers, whose\r\nbusiness it is to look out for new varieties, who have expressed\r\nunbounded astonishment at the number of new forms produced by\r\ngraft-hybridisation. It may be argued that it is merely the operation\r\nof grafting, and not the union of two kinds, which causes so\r\nextraordinary an amount of bud-variation; but this objection is at once\r\nanswered by the fact that potatoes are habitually propagated by the\r\ntubers being cut into pieces, and the sole difference in the case of\r\ngraft-hybrids is that either a half or a smaller segment or a cylinder\r\nis placed in close opposition with the tissue of another variety.\r\nMoreover, in two cases, the young stems were grafted together, and the\r\nplants thus united yielded the same results as when the tubers were\r\nunited. It is an argument of the greatest weight that when varieties\r\nare produced by simple bud-variation, they frequently present quite new\r\ncharacters; whereas in all the numerous cases above given, as Herr\r\nMagnus likewise insists, the graft-hybrids are intermediate in\r\ncharacter between the two forms employed. That such a result should\r\nfollow if the one kind did not affect the other is incredible.\r\n\r\nCharacters of all kinds are affected by graft hybridisation, in\r\nwhatever way the grafting may have been effected. The plants thus\r\nraised yield tubers which partake of the widely different colours,\r\nform, state of surface, position and shape of the eye of the parents;\r\nand according to two careful observers they are also intermediate in\r\ncertain constitutional peculiarities. But we should bear in mind that\r\nin all the varieties of the potato, the tubers differ much more than\r\nany other part.\r\n\r\nThe potato affords the best evidence of the possibility of the\r\nformation of graft-hybrids, but we must not overlook the account given\r\nof the origin of the famous _Cytisus adami_ by M. Adam, who had no\r\nconceivable motive for deception, and the exactly parallel account of\r\nthe origin of the Bizzarria orange, namely by graft-hybridisation. Nor\r\nmust the cases be undervalued in which different varieties or species\r\nof vines, hyacinths and roses, have been grafted together, and have\r\nyielded intermediate forms. It is evident that graft-hybrids can be\r\nmade much more easily with some plants, as the potato, than with\r\nothers, for instance our common fruit trees; for these latter have been\r\ngrafted by the million during many centuries, and though the graft is\r\noften slightly affected, it is very doubtful whether this may not be\r\naccounted for, merely by a more or less free supply of nutriment.\r\nNevertheless, the cases above given seem to me to prove that under\r\ncertain unknown conditions graft-hybridisation can be effected.\r\n\r\nHerr Magnus asserts with much truth that graft-hybrids resemble in all\r\nrespects seminal hybrids, including their great diversity of character.\r\nThere is, however, a partial exception, inasmuch as the characters of\r\nthe two parent forms are not often homogeneously blended together in\r\ngraft-hybrids. They much more commonly appear in a segregated\r\ncondition,—that is, in segments either at first, or subsequently\r\nthrough reversion. It would seem that the reproductive elements are not\r\nso completely blended by grafting as by sexual generation. But\r\nsegregation of this kind occurs by no means rarely, as will be\r\nimmediately shown, in seminal hybrids. Finally it must, I think, be\r\nadmitted that we learn from the foregoing cases a highly important\r\nphysiological fact, namely, that the elements that go to the production\r\nof a new being, are not necessarily formed by the male and female\r\norgans. They are present in the cellular tissue in such a state that\r\nthey can unite without the aid of the sexual organs, and thus give rise\r\nto a new bud partaking of the characters of the two parent-forms.\r\n\r\n_On the segregation of the parental characters in seminal hybrids by\r\nbud-variation._—I will now give a sufficient number of cases to show\r\nthat segregation of this kind, namely, by buds, may occur in ordinary\r\nhybrids raised from seed.\r\n\r\nHybrids were raised by Gärtner between _Tropæolum minus_ and\r\n_majus_[116] which at first produced flowers intermediate in size,\r\ncolour, and structure between their two parents; but later in the\r\nseason some of these plants produced flowers in all respects like those\r\nof the mother-form, mingled with flowers still retaining the usual\r\nintermediate condition. A hybrid Cereus between _C. speciosissimus_ and\r\n_phyllanthus,_[117] plants which are widely different in appearance,\r\nproduced for the first three years angular, five-sided stems, and then\r\nsome flat stems like those of _C. phyllanthus._ Kölreuter also gives\r\ncases of hybrid Lobelias and Verbascums, which at first produced\r\nflowers of one colour, and later in the season, flowers of a different\r\ncolour.[118] Naudin[119] raised forty hybrids from _Datura lævis_\r\nfertilised by _D. stramonium_; and three of these hybrids produced many\r\ncapsules, of which a half, or quarter, or lesser segment was smooth and\r\nof small size, like the capsule of the pure _D. lævis,_ the remaining\r\npart being spinose and of larger size, like the capsule of the pure _D.\r\nstramonium_: from one of these composite capsules, plants perfectly\r\nresembling both parent-forms were raised.\r\n\r\nTurning now to varieties. A _ seedling_ apple, conjectured to be of\r\ncrossed parentage, has been described in France,[120] which bears fruit\r\nwith one half larger than the other, of a red colour, acid taste, and\r\npeculiar odour; the other side being greenish-yellow and very sweet: it\r\nis said scarcely ever to include perfectly developed seed. I suppose\r\nthat this is not the same tree as that which Gaudichaud[121] exhibited\r\nbefore the French institute, bearing on the same branch two distinct\r\nkinds of apples, one a _reinette rouge,_ and the other like a _reinette\r\ncanada jaunâtre_: this double-bearing variety can be propagated by\r\ngrafts, and continues to produce both kinds; its origin is unknown. The\r\nRev. J. D. La Touche sent me a coloured drawing of an apple which he\r\nbrought from Canada, of which half, surrounding and including the whole\r\nof the calyx and the insertion of the foot-stalk, is green, the other\r\nhalf being brown and of the nature of the _pomme gris_ apple, with the\r\nline of separation between the two halves exactly defined. The tree was\r\na grafted one, and Mr. La Touche thinks that the branches which bore\r\nthis curious apple sprung from the point of junction of the graft and\r\nstock: had this fact been ascertained, the case would probably have\r\ncome into the class of graft-hybrids already given. But the branch may\r\nhave sprung from the stock, which no doubt was a seedling.\r\n\r\nProf. H. Lecoq, who has made a great number of crossings between the\r\ndifferently coloured varieties of _Mirabilis jalapa,_[122] finds that\r\nin the seedlings the colours rarely combine, but form distinct stripes;\r\nor half the flower is of one colour and half of a different colour.\r\nSome varieties regularly bear flowers striped with yellow, white, and\r\nred; but plants of such varieties occasionally produce on the same root\r\nbranches with uniformly coloured flowers of all three tints, and other\r\nbranches with half-and-half coloured flowers, and others with marbled\r\nflowers. Gallesio[123] crossed reciprocally white and red carnations,\r\nand the seedlings were striped; but some of the striped plants also\r\nbore entirely white and entirely red flowers. Some of these plants\r\nproduced one year red flowers alone, and in the following year striped\r\nflowers; or conversely, some plants, after having borne for two or\r\nthree years striped flowers, would revert and bear exclusively red\r\nflowers. It may be worth mentioning that I fertilised the _Purple\r\nSweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus)_ with pollen from the light-coloured\r\n_Painted Lady_: seedlings raised from the same pod were not\r\nintermediate in character, but perfectly resembled either parent. Later\r\nin the summer, the plants which had at first borne flowers identical\r\nwith those of the _Painted Lady,_ produced flowers streaked and\r\nblotched with purple; showing in these darker marks a tendency to\r\nreversion to the mother-variety. Andrew Knight[124] fertilised two\r\nwhite grapes with pollen of the Aleppo grape, which is darkly\r\nvariegated both in its leaves and fruit. The result was that the young\r\nseedlings were not at first variegated, but all became variegated\r\nduring the succeeding summer; besides this, many produced on the same\r\nplant bunches of grapes which were all black, or all white, or\r\nlead-coloured striped with white, or white dotted with minute black\r\nstripes; and grapes of all these shades could frequently be found on\r\nthe same foot-stalk.\r\n\r\nI will append a very curious case, not of bud-variation, but of two\r\ncohering embryos, different in character and contained within the same\r\nseed. A distinguished botanist, Mr. G. H. Thwaites,[125] states that a\r\nseed from _Fuchsia coccinea_ fertilised by _F. fulgens,_ contained two\r\nembryos, and was “a true vegetable twin.” The two plants produced from\r\nthe two embryos were “extremely different in appearance and character,”\r\nthough both resembled other hybrids of the same parentage produced at\r\nthe same time. These twin plants “were closely coherent, below the two\r\npairs of cotyledon-leaves, into a single cylindrical stem, so that they\r\nhad subsequently the appearance of being branches on one trunk.” Had\r\nthe two united stems grown up to their full height, instead of dying, a\r\ncuriously mixed hybrid would have been produced. A mongrel melon\r\ndescribed by Sageret[126] may perhaps have thus originated; for the two\r\nmain branches, which arose from two cotyledon-buds, produced very\r\ndifferent fruit,—on the one branch like that of the paternal variety,\r\nand on the other branch like to a certain extent that of the maternal\r\nvariety, the melon of China.\r\n\r\nIn most of these cases of crossed varieties, and in some of the cases\r\nof crossed species, the colours proper to both parents appeared in the\r\nseedlings, as soon as they first flowered, in the form of stripes or\r\nlarger segments, or as whole flowers or fruit of different kinds borne\r\non the same plant; and in this case the appearance of the two colours\r\ncannot strictly be said to be due to reversion, but to some incapacity\r\nof fusion. When, however, the later flowers or fruit produced during\r\nthe same season, or during a succeeding year or generation, become\r\nstriped or half-and-half, etc., the segregation of the two colours is\r\nstrictly a case of reversion by bud-variation. Whether all the many\r\nrecorded cases of striped flowers and fruit are due to previous\r\nhybridisation and reversion is by no means clear, for instance with\r\npeaches and nectarines, moss-roses, etc. In a future chapter I shall\r\nshow that, with animals of crossed parentage, the same individual has\r\nbeen known to change its character during growth, and to revert to one\r\nof its parents which it did not at first resemble. Finally, from the\r\nvarious facts now given, there can be no doubt that the same individual\r\nplant, whether a hybrid or a mongrel, sometimes returns in its leaves,\r\nflowers, and fruit, either wholly or by segments, to both parent-forms.\r\n\r\n_On the direct or immediate action of the male element on the mother\r\nform._—Another remarkable class of facts must be here considered,\r\nfirstly, because they have a high physiological importance, and\r\nsecondly, because they have been supposed to account for some cases of\r\nbud-variation. I refer to the direct action of the male element, not in\r\nthe ordinary way on the ovules, but on certain parts of the female\r\nplant, or in case of animals on the subsequent progeny of the female by\r\na second male. I may premise that with plants the ovarium and the coats\r\nof the ovules are obviously parts of the female, and it could not have\r\nbeen anticipated that they would have been affected by the pollen of a\r\nforeign variety or species, although the development of the embryo,\r\ninside the embryonic sack, inside the ovule and ovarium, of course,\r\ndepends on the male element.\r\n\r\nEven as long ago as 1729 it was observed[127] that white and blue\r\nvarieties of the Pea, when planted near each other, mutually crossed,\r\nno doubt through the agency of bees, and in the autumn blue and white\r\npeas were found within the same pods. Wiegmann made an exactly similar\r\nobservation in the present century. The same result has followed\r\nseveral times when a variety with peas of one colour has been\r\nartificially crossed by a differently-coloured variety.[128] These\r\nstatements led Gärtner, who was highly sceptical on the subject,\r\ncarefully to try a long series of experiments: he selected the most\r\nconstant varieties, and the result conclusively showed that the colour\r\nof the skin of the pea is modified when pollen of a differently\r\ncoloured variety is used. This conclusion has since been confirmed by\r\nexperiments made by the Rev. J. M. Berkeley.[129]\r\n\r\nMr. Laxton of Stamford, whilst making experiments on peas for the\r\nexpress purpose of ascertaining the influence of foreign pollen on the\r\nmother-plant, has recently[130] observed an important additional fact.\r\nHe fertilised the Tall Sugar-pea, which bears very thin green pods,\r\nbecoming brownish-white when dry, with pollen of the Purple-podded pea,\r\nwhich, as its name expresses, has dark-purple pods with very thick\r\nskin, becoming pale reddish purple when dry. Mr. Laxton has cultivated\r\nthe tall sugar-pea during twenty years, and has never seen or heard of\r\nit producing a purple pod: nevertheless, a flower fertilised by pollen\r\nfrom the purple-pod yielded a pod clouded with purplish-red which Mr.\r\nLaxton kindly gave to me. A space of about two inches in length towards\r\nthe extremity of the pod, and a smaller space near the stalk, were thus\r\ncoloured. On comparing the colour with that of the purple pod, both\r\npods having been first dried and then soaked in water, it was found to\r\nbe identically the same; and in both the colour was confined to the\r\ncells lying immediately beneath the outer skin of the pod. The valves\r\nof the crossed pod were also decidedly thicker and stronger than those\r\nof the pods of the mother-plant, but this may possibly have been an\r\naccidental circumstance, for I know not how far their thickness is a\r\nvariable character in the Tall Sugar-pea.\r\n\r\nThe peas of the Tall Sugar-pea, when dry, are pale greenish-brown,\r\nthickly covered with dots of dark purple so minute as to be visible\r\nonly through a lens, and Mr. Laxton has never seen or heard of this\r\nvariety producing a purple pea; but in the crossed pod one of the peas\r\nwas of a uniform beautiful violet-purple tint, and a second was\r\nirregularly clouded with pale purple. The colour lies in the outer of\r\nthe two coats which surround the pea. As the peas of the purple-podded\r\nvariety when dry are of a pale greenish-buff, it would at first appear\r\nthat this remarkable change of colour in the peas in the crossed pod\r\ncould not have been caused by the direct action of the pollen of the\r\npurple-pod: but when we bear in mind that this latter variety has\r\npurple flowers, purple marks on its stipules, and purple pods; and that\r\nthe Tall Sugar-pea likewise has purple flowers and stipules, and\r\nmicroscopically minute purple dots on the peas, we can hardly doubt\r\nthat the tendency to the production of purple in both parents has in\r\ncombination modified the colour of the peas in the crossed pod. After\r\nhaving examined these specimens, I crossed the same two varieties, and\r\nthe peas in one pod but not the pods themselves, were clouded and\r\ntinted with purplish-red in a much more conspicuous manner than the\r\npeas in the uncrossed pods produced at the same time by the same\r\nplants. I may notice as a caution that Mr. Laxton sent me various other\r\ncrossed peas slightly, or even greatly, modified in colour; but the\r\nchange in these cases was due, as had been suspected by Mr. Laxton, to\r\nthe altered colour of the cotyledons, seen through the transparent\r\ncoats of the peas; and as the cotyledons are parts of the embryo, these\r\ncases are not in any way remarkable.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the genus Matthiola. The pollen of one kind of stock\r\nsometimes affects the colour of the seeds of another kind, used as the\r\nmother-plant. I give the following case the more readily, as Gärtner\r\ndoubted similar statements previously made with respect to the stock by\r\nother observers. A well-known horticulturist, Major Trevor Clarke,\r\ninforms me[131] that the seeds of the large red-flowered _biennial_\r\nstock, _Matthiola annua_ (_Cocardeau_ of the French), are light brown,\r\nand those of the purple branching Queen stock (_M. incana_) are\r\nviolet-black; and he found that, when flowers of the red stock were\r\nfertilised by pollen from the purple stock, they yielded about fifty\r\nper cent of _black_ seeds. He sent me four pods from a red flowered\r\nplant, two of which had been fertilised by their own pollen, and they\r\nincluded pale brown seed; and two which had been crossed by pollen from\r\nthe purple kind, and they included seeds all deeply tinged with black.\r\nThese latter seeds yielded purple-flowered plants like their father;\r\nwhilst the pale brown seeds yielded normal red-flowered plants; and\r\nMajor Clarke, by sowing similar seeds, has observed on a greater scale\r\nthe same result. The evidence in this case of the direct action of the\r\npollen of one species on the colour of the seeds of another species\r\nappears to me conclusive.\r\n\r\nGallesio[132] fertilised the flowers of an orange with pollen from the\r\nlemon; and one fruit thus produced bore a longitudinal stripe of peel\r\nhaving the colour, flavour, and other characters of the lemon. Mr.\r\nAnderson[133] fertilised a green-fleshed melon with pollen from a\r\nscarlet-fleshed kind; in two of the fruits “a sensible change was\r\nperceptible: and four other fruits were somewhat altered both\r\ninternally and externally.” The seeds of the two first-mentioned fruits\r\nproduced plants partaking of the good properties of both parents. In\r\nthe United States, where Cucurbitaceæ are largely cultivated, it is the\r\npopular belief[134] that the fruit is thus directly affected hy foreign\r\npollen; and I have received a similar statement with respect to the\r\ncucumber in England. It is believed that grapes have been thus affected\r\nin colour, size, and shape: in France a pale-coloured grape had its\r\njuice tinted by the pollen of the dark-coloured Teinturier; in Germany\r\na variety bore berries which were affected by the pollen of two\r\nadjoining kinds; some of the berries being only partially affected or\r\nmottled.[135]\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1751[136] it was observed that, when\r\ndifferently-coloured varieties of maize grew near each other, they\r\nmutually affected each other’s seeds, and this is now a popular belief\r\nin the United States. Dr. Savi[137] tried the experiment with care: he\r\nsowed yellow and black-seeded maize together, and on the same ear some\r\nof the seeds were yellow, some black, and some mottled, the differently\r\ncoloured seeds being arranged irregularly or in rows. Prof. Hildebrand\r\nhas repeated the experiment[138] with the precaution of ascertaining\r\nthat the mother-plant was true. A kind bearing yellow grains was\r\nfertilised with pollen of a kind having brown grains, and two ears\r\nproduced yellow grains mingled with others of a dirty violet tint. A\r\nthird ear had only yellow grains, but one side of the spindle was\r\ntinted of a reddish-brown; so that here we have the important fact of\r\nthe influence of the foreign pollen extending to the axis. Mr. Arnold,\r\nin Canada, varied the experiment in an interesting manner: “a female\r\nflower was subjected first to the action of pollen from a yellow\r\nvariety, and then to that from a white variety; the result was an ear,\r\neach grain of which was yellow below and white above.”[139] With other\r\nplants it has occasionally been observed that the crossed offspring\r\nshowed the influence of two kinds of pollen, but in this case the two\r\nkinds affected the mother-plant.\r\n\r\nMr. Sabine states[140] that he has seen the form of the nearly globular\r\nseed-capsule of _Amaryllis vittata_ altered by the application of the\r\npollen of another species, of which the capsule has gibbous angles.\r\nWith an allied genus, a well-known botanist, Maximowicz, has described\r\nin detail the striking results of reciprocally fertilising _Lilium\r\nbulbiferum_ and _ davuricum_ with each other’s pollen. Each species\r\nproduced fruit not like its own, but almost identical with that of the\r\npollen-bearing species; but from an accident only the fruit of the\r\nlatter species was carefully examined; the seeds were intermediate in\r\nthe development of their wings.[141]\r\n\r\nFritz Müller fertilised _Cattleya leopoldi_ with pollen of _Epidendron\r\ncinnabarinum_; and the capsules contained very few seeds; but these\r\npresented a most wonderful appearance, which, from the description\r\ngiven, two botanists, Hildebrand and Maximowicz, attribute to the\r\ndirect action of the pollen of the Epidendron.[142]\r\n\r\nMr. J. Anderson Henry[143] crossed _Rhododendron dalhousiæ_ with the\r\npollen of _R. nuttallii,_ which is one of the largest-flowered and\r\nnoblest species of the genus. The largest pod produced by the former\r\nspecies, when fertilised with its own pollen, measured 1¼ inch in\r\nlength and 1½ in girth; whilst three of the pods which had been\r\nfertilised by pollen of _R. nuttallii_ measured 1-5/8 inch in length\r\nand no less than 2 inches in girth. Here the effect of the foreign\r\npollen was apparently confined to increasing the size of the ovarium;\r\nbut we must be cautious in assuming, as the following case shows, that\r\nsize had been transferred from the male parent to the capsule of the\r\nfemale plant. Mr. Henry fertilised _Arabis blepharophylla_ with pollen\r\nof _A. soyeri,_ and the pods thus produced, of which he was so kind as\r\nto send me detailed measurements and sketches, were much larger in all\r\ntheir dimensions than those naturally produced by either the male or\r\nfemale parent-species. In a future chapter we shall see that the organs\r\nof vegetation in hybrid plants, independently of the character of\r\neither parent, are sometimes developed to a monstrous size; and the\r\nincreased size of the pods in the foregoing cases may be an analogous\r\nfact. On the other hand, M. de Saporta informs me that an isolated\r\nfemale plant of _Pistacia vera_ is very apt to be fertilised by the\r\npollen of neighbouring plants of _P. terebinthus,_ and in this case the\r\nfruits are only half their proper size, which he attributes to the\r\ninfluence of the pollen of _P. terebinthus._\r\n\r\nNo case of the direct action of the pollen of one variety on another is\r\nbetter authenticated or more remarkable than that of the common apple.\r\nThe fruit here consists of the lower part of the calyx and of the upper\r\npart of the flower-peduncle[144] in a metamorphosed condition, so that\r\nthe effect of the foreign pollen has extended even beyond the limits of\r\nthe ovarium. Cases of apples thus affected were recorded by Bradley in\r\nthe early part of the last century; and other cases are given in old\r\nvolumes of the ‘Philosophical Transactions’;[145] in one of these a\r\nRusseting apple and an adjoining kind mutually affected each other’s\r\nfruit; and in another case a smooth apple affected a rough-coated kind.\r\nAnother instance has been given[146] of two very different apple-trees\r\ngrowing close to each other, which bore fruit resembling each other,\r\nbut only on the adjoining branches. It is, however, almost superfluous\r\nto adduce these or other cases, after that of the St. Valery apple, the\r\nflowers which, from the abortion of the stamens, do not produce pollen,\r\nbut are fertilised by the girls of the neighbourhood with pollen of\r\nmany kinds; and they bear fruit, “differing from one another in size,\r\nflavour, and colour, but resembling in character the hermaphrodite\r\nkinds by which they have been fertilised.”[147]\r\n\r\nI have now shown, on the authority of several excellent observers, in\r\nthe case of plants belonging to widely different orders, that the\r\npollen of one species or variety, when applied to the female of a\r\ndistinct form, occasionally causes the coats of the seeds, the ovarium\r\nor fruit, including even the calyx and upper part of the peduncle of\r\nthe apple, and the axis of the ear in maize, to be modified. Sometimes\r\nthe whole ovarium or all the seeds are thus affected; sometimes only a\r\ncertain number of the seeds, as in the case of the pea, or only a part\r\nof the ovarium, as with the striped orange, mottled grapes, and maize,\r\nis thus affected. It must not be supposed that any direct or immediate\r\neffect invariably follows the use of foreign pollen: this is far from\r\nbeing the case; nor is it known on what conditions the result depends.\r\nMr. Knight[148] expressly states that he has never seen the fruit thus\r\naffected, though he crossed thousands of apple and other fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nThere is not the least reason to believe that a branch which has borne\r\nseed or fruit directly modified by foreign pollen is itself affected,\r\nso as afterwards to produce modified buds; such an occurrence, from the\r\ntemporary connection of the flower with the stem, would be hardly\r\npossible. Hence, but very few, if any, of the cases of bud-variation in\r\nthe fruit of trees, given in the early part of this chapter can be\r\naccounted for by the action of foreign pollen; for such fruits have\r\ncommonly been propagated by budding or grafting. It is also obvious\r\nthat changes of colour in flowers, which necessarily supervene long\r\nbefore they are ready for fertilisation, and changes in the shape or\r\ncolour of leaves, when due to the appearance of modified buds, can have\r\nno relation to the action of foreign pollen.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of the action of foreign pollen on the mother-plant have\r\nbeen given in considerable detail, because this action, as we shall see\r\nin a future chapter, is of the highest theoretical importance, and\r\nbecause it is in itself a remarkable and apparently anomalous\r\ncircumstance. That it is remarkable under a physiological point of view\r\nis clear, for the male element not only affects, in accordance with its\r\nproper function, the germ, but at the same time various parts of the\r\nmother-plant, in the same manner, as it affects the same part in the\r\nseminal offspring from the same two parents. We thus learn that an\r\novule is not indispensable for the reception of the influence of the\r\nmale element. But this direct action of the male element is not so\r\nanomalous as it at first appears, for it comes into play in the\r\nordinary fertilisation of many flowers. Gärtner gradually increased the\r\nnumber of pollen grains until he succeeded in fertilising a Malva, and\r\nhas[149] proved that many grains are first expended in the development,\r\nor, as he expresses it, in the satiation, of the pistil and ovarium.\r\nAgain, when one plant is fertilised by a widely distinct species, it\r\noften happens that the ovarium is fully and quickly developed without\r\nany seeds being formed; or the coats of the seeds are formed without\r\nany embryo being developed within. Prof. Hildebrand, also, has lately\r\nshown[150] that, in the normal fertilisation of several Orchideæ, the\r\naction of the plant’s own pollen is necessary for the development of\r\nthe ovarium; and that this development takes place not only long before\r\nthe pollen-tubes have reached the ovules, but even before the placentæ\r\nand ovules have been formed; so that with these orchids the pollen acts\r\ndirectly on the ovarium. On the other hand, we must not overrate the\r\nefficacy of pollen in the case of hybridised plants, for an embryo may\r\nbe formed and its influence excite the surrounding tissues of the\r\nmother-plant, and then perish at a very early age and be thus\r\noverlooked. Again, it is well known that with many plants the ovarium\r\nmay be fully developed, though pollen be wholly excluded. Lastly, Mr.\r\nSmith, the late Curator at Kew (as I hear through Dr. Hooker), observed\r\nwith an orchid, the _Bonatea speciosa,_ the singular fact that the\r\ndevelopment of the ovarium could be effected by the mechanical\r\nirritation of the stigma. Nevertheless, from the number of the\r\npollen-grains expended “in the satiation of the ovarium and\r\npistil,”—from the generality of the formation of the ovarium and\r\nseed-coats in hybridised plants which produce no seeds,—and from Dr.\r\nHildebrand’s observations on orchids, we may admit that in most cases\r\nthe swelling of the ovarium, and the formation of the seed-coats are at\r\nleast aided, if not wholly caused, by the direct action of the pollen,\r\nindependently of the intervention of the fertilised germ. Therefore, in\r\nthe previously given cases we have only to believe in the further power\r\nof pollen, when applied to a distinct species or variety, to influence\r\nthe shape, size, colour, texture, etc., of certain parts of the\r\nmother-plant.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the animal kingdom. If we could imagine the same flower\r\nto yield seeds during successive years, then it would not be very\r\nsurprising that a flower of which the ovarium had been modified by\r\nforeign pollen should next year produce, when self-fertilised,\r\noffspring modified by the previous male influence. Closely analogous\r\ncases have actually occurred with animals. In the case often quoted\r\nfrom Lord Morton,[151] a nearly purely-bred Arabian chestnut mare bore\r\na hybrid to a quagga; she was subsequently sent to Sir Gore Ouseley,\r\nand produced two colts by a black Arabian horse. These colts were\r\npartially dun-coloured, and were striped on the legs more plainly than\r\nthe real hybrid, or even than the quagga. One of the two colts had its\r\nneck and some other parts of its body plainly marked with stripes.\r\nStripes on the body, not to mention those on the legs, are extremely\r\nrare,—I speak after having long attended to the subject,—with horses of\r\nall kinds in Europe, and are almost unknown in the case of Arabians.\r\nBut what makes the case still more striking is that in these colts the\r\nhair of the mane resembled that of the quagga, being short, stiff, and\r\nupright. Hence there can be no doubt that the quagga affected the\r\ncharacter of the offspring subsequently begot by the black Arabian\r\nhorse. Mr. Jenner Weir informs me of a strictly parallel case: his\r\nneighbour Mr. Lethbridge, of Blackheath, has a horse, bred by Lord\r\nMostyn, which had previously borne a foal by a quagga. This horse is\r\ndun with a dark stripe down the back, faint stripes on the forehead\r\nbetween the eyes, plain stripes on the inner side of the fore-legs and\r\nrather more faint ones on the hind-legs, with no shoulder-stripe. The\r\nmane grows much lower on the forehead than in the horse, but not so low\r\nas in the quagga or zebra. The hoofs are proportionally longer than in\r\nthe horse,—so much so that the farrier who first shod this animal, and\r\nknew nothing of its origin, said, “Had I not seen I was shoeing a\r\nhorse, I should have thought I was shoeing a donkey.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to the varieties of our domesticated animals, many similar\r\nand well-authenticated facts have been published,[152] and others have\r\nbeen communicated to me, plainly showing the influence of the first\r\nmale on the progeny subsequently borne by the mother to other males. It\r\nwill suffice to give a single instance, recorded in the ‘Philosophical\r\nTransactions,’ in a paper following that by Lord Morton: Mr. Giles put\r\na sow of Lord Western’s black and white Essex breed to a wild boar of a\r\ndeep chestnut colour; and the “pigs produced partook in appearance of\r\nboth boar and sow, but in some the chestnut colour of the boar strongly\r\nprevailed.” After the boar had long been dead, the sow was put to a\r\nboar of her own black and white breed—a kind which is well known to\r\nbreed very true and never to show any chestnut colour,—yet from this\r\nunion the sow produced some young pigs which were plainly marked with\r\nthe same chestnut tint as in the first litter. Similar cases have so\r\nfrequently occurred, that careful breeders avoid putting a choice\r\nfemale of any animal to an inferior male, on account of the injury to\r\nher subsequent progeny which may be expected to follow.\r\n\r\nSome physiologists have attempted to account for these remarkable\r\nresults from a previous impregnation, by the imagination of the mother\r\nhaving been strongly affected; but it will hereafter be seen that there\r\nare very slight grounds for any such belief. Other physiologists\r\nattribute the result to the close attachment and freely\r\nintercommunicating blood-vessels between the modified embryo and\r\nmother. But the analogy from the action of foreign pollen on the\r\novarium, seed-coats, and other parts of the mother-plant, strongly\r\nsupports the belief that with animals the male element acts directly on\r\nthe female, and not through the crossed embryo. With birds there is no\r\nclose connection between the embryo and mother; yet a careful observer,\r\nDr. Chapuis, states[153] that with pigeons the influence of a first\r\nmale sometimes makes itself perceived in the succeeding broods; but\r\nthis statement requires confirmation.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion and Summary of the Chapter._—The facts given in the latter\r\nhalf of this chapter are well worthy of consideration, as they show us\r\nin how many extraordinary modes the union of one form with another may\r\nlead to the modification of the seminal offspring or of the buds,\r\nafterwards produced.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing surprising in the offspring of species or varieties\r\ncrossed in the ordinary manner being modified; but the case of two\r\nplants within the same seed, which cohere and differ from each other,\r\nis curious. When a bud is formed after the cellular tissue of two\r\nspecies or two varieties have been united, and it partakes of the\r\ncharacters of both parents, the case is wonderful. But I need not here\r\nrepeat what has been so lately said on this subject. We have also seen\r\nthat in the case of plants the male element may affect in a direct\r\nmanner the tissues of the mother, and with animals may lead to the\r\nmodification of her future progeny. In the vegetable kingdom the\r\noffspring from a cross between two species or varieties, whether\r\neffected by seminal generation or by grafting, often revert, to a\r\ngreater or less degree, in the first or in a succeeding generation, to\r\nthe two parent-forms; and this reversion may affect the whole flower,\r\nfruit, or leaf-bud, or only the half or a smaller segment of a single\r\norgan. In some cases, however, such segregation of character apparently\r\ndepends on an incapacity for union rather than on reversion, for the\r\nflowers or fruit which are first produced display by segments the\r\ncharacters of both parents. The various facts here given ought to be\r\nwell considered by any one who wishes to embrace under a single point\r\nof view the many modes of reproduction by gemmation, division, and\r\nsexual union, the reparation of lost parts, variation, inheritance,\r\nreversion, and other such phenomena. Towards the close of the second\r\nvolume I shall attempt to connect these facts together by the\r\nhypothesis of pangenesis.\r\n\r\nIn the early half of the present chapter I have given a long list of\r\nplants in which through bud-variation, that is, independently of\r\nreproduction by seed, the fruit has suddenly become modified in size,\r\ncolour, flavour, hairiness, shape, and time of maturity; flowers have\r\nsimilarly changed in shape, colour, in being double, and greatly in the\r\ncharacter of the calyx; young branches or shoots have changed in\r\ncolour, in bearing spines and in habit of growth, as in climbing or in\r\nweeping; leaves have changed in becoming variegated, in shape, period\r\nof unfolding, and in their arrangement on the axis. Buds of all kinds,\r\nwhether produced on ordinary branches or on subterranean stems, whether\r\nsimple or much modified and supplied with a stock of nutriment, as in\r\ntubers and bulbs, are all liable to sudden variations of the same\r\ngeneral nature.\r\n\r\nIn the list, many of the cases are certainly due to reversion to\r\ncharacters not acquired from a cross, but which were formerly present\r\nand have since been lost for a longer or shorter time;—as when a bud on\r\na variegated plant produces plain leaves, or when the\r\nvariously-coloured flowers of the Chrysanthemum revert to the\r\naboriginal yellow tint. Many other cases included in the list are\r\nprobably due to the plants being of crossed parentage, and to the buds\r\nreverting either completely or by segments to one of the two\r\nparent-forms.[154]\r\n\r\nWe may suspect that the strong tendency in the Chrysanthemum to produce\r\nby bud-variation differently-coloured flowers, results from the\r\nvarieties having been at some time intentionally or accidentally\r\ncrossed; and this is certainly the case with some kinds of Pelargonium.\r\nSo it may be to a large extent with the bud-varieties of the Dahlia,\r\nand with the “broken colours” of Tulips. When, however, a plant reverts\r\nby bud-variation to its two parent forms, or to one of them, it\r\nsometimes does not revert perfectly, but assumes a somewhat new\r\ncharacter,—of which fact, instances have been given, and Carrière\r\ngives[155] another in the cherry.\r\n\r\nMany cases of bud-variation, however, cannot be attributed to\r\nreversion, but to so-called spontaneous variability, as is so common\r\nwith cultivated plants raised from seed. As a single variety of the\r\nChrysanthemum has produced by buds six other varieties, and as one\r\nvariety of the gooseberry has borne at the same time four distinct\r\nkinds of fruit, it is scarcely possible to believe that all these\r\nvariations are due to reversion. We can hardly believe, as remarked in\r\na previous chapter, that all the many peaches which have yielded\r\nnectarine-buds are of crossed parentage. Lastly, in such cases as that\r\nof the moss-rose, with its peculiar calyx, and of the rose which bears\r\nopposite leaves, in that of the Imatophyllum, etc., there is no known\r\nnatural species or variety from which the characters in question could\r\nhave been derived by a cross. We must attribute all such cases to the\r\nappearance of absolutely new characters in the buds. The varieties\r\nwhich have thus arisen cannot be distinguished by any external\r\ncharacter from seedlings; this is notoriously the case with the\r\nvarieties of the Rose, Azalea, and many other plants. It deserves\r\nnotice that all the plants which have yielded bud-variations have\r\nlikewise varied greatly by seed.\r\n\r\nThe plants which have varied by buds belong to so many orders that we\r\nmay infer that almost every plant would be liable to variation, if\r\nplaced under the proper exciting conditions. These conditions, as far\r\nas we can judge, mainly depend on long-continued and high cultivation;\r\nfor almost all the plants in the foregoing list are perennials, and\r\nhave been largely propagated in many soils, under different climates,\r\nby cuttings, offsets, bulbs, tubers, and especially by budding or\r\ngrafting. The instances of annuals varying by buds, or producing on the\r\nsame plant differently coloured flowers, are comparatively rare:\r\nHopkirk[156] has seen this with _ Convolvulus tricolor_; and it is not\r\nuncommon with the Balsam and annual Delphinium. According to Sir R.\r\nSchomburgk, plants from the warmer temperate regions, when cultivated\r\nunder the hot climate of St. Domingo, are eminently liable to\r\nbud-variation. I am informed by Mr. Sedgwick that moss-roses which have\r\noften been taken to Calcutta always there lose their mossiness; but\r\nchange of climate is by no means a necessary contingent, as we see with\r\nthe gooseberry, currant, and in many other cases. Plants living under\r\ntheir natural conditions are very rarely subject to bud-variation.\r\nVariegated leaves have, however, been observed under such\r\ncircumstances; and I have given an instance of variation by buds on an\r\nash-tree planted in ornamental grounds, but it is doubtful whether such\r\na tree can be considered as living under strictly natural conditions.\r\nGärtner has seen white and dark-red flowers produced from the same root\r\nof the wild _Achillea millefolium_; and Prof. Caspary has seen a\r\ncompletely wild _ Viola lutea_ bearing flowers of two different colours\r\nand sizes.[157]\r\n\r\nAs wild plants are so rarely liable to bud-variation, whilst highly\r\ncultivated plants long propagated by artificial means have yielded many\r\nvarieties by this form of reproduction, we are led through a series\r\nsuch as the following,—namely, all the eyes in the same tuber of the\r\npotato varying in the same manner,—all the fruit on a purple plum-tree\r\nsuddenly becoming yellow,—all the fruit on a double-flowered almond\r\nsuddenly becoming peach like,—all the buds on grafted trees being in a\r\nvery slight degree affected by the stock on which they have been\r\nworked,—all the flowers on a transplanted heartsease changing for a\r\ntime in colour, size, and shape,—we are led by such a series to look at\r\nevery case of bud-variation as the direct result of the conditions of\r\nlife to which the plant has been exposed. On the other hand, plants of\r\nthe same variety may be cultivated in two adjoining beds, apparently\r\nunder exactly the same conditions, and those in the one bed, as\r\nCarrière insists,[158] will produce many bud-variations, and those in\r\nthe other not a single one. Again, if we look to such cases as that of\r\na peach-tree which, after having been cultivated by tens of thousands\r\nduring many years in many countries, and after having annually produced\r\nmillions of buds, all of which have apparently been exposed to\r\nprecisely the same conditions, yet at last suddenly produces a single\r\nbud with its whole character greatly transformed, we are driven to the\r\nconclusion that the transformation stands in no _direct_ relation to\r\nthe conditions of life.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that varieties produced from seeds and from buds resemble\r\neach other so closely in general appearance that they cannot be\r\ndistinguished. Just as certain species and groups of species, when\r\npropagated by seed, are more variable than other species or genera, so\r\nit is in the case of certain bud-varieties. Thus, the Queen of England\r\nChrysanthemum has produced by this latter process no less than six, and\r\nRollisson’s Unique Pelargonium four distinct varieties; moss-roses have\r\nalso produced several other moss-roses. The Rosaceæ have varied by buds\r\nmore than any other group of plants; but this may be in large part due\r\nto so many members having been long cultivated; but within this same\r\ngroup, the peach has often varied by buds, whilst the apple and pear,\r\nboth grafted trees extensively cultivated, have afforded, as far as I\r\ncan ascertain, extremely few instances of bud-variation.\r\n\r\nThe law of analogous variation holds good with varieties produced by\r\nbuds, as with those produced from seed: more than one kind of rose has\r\nsported into a moss-rose; more than one kind of camellia has assumed an\r\nhexagonal form; and at least seven or eight varieties of the peach have\r\nproduced nectarines.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance seem to be nearly the same with seminal and\r\nbud-varieties. We know how commonly reversion comes into play with\r\nboth, and it may affect the whole, or only segments of a leaf, flower,\r\nor fruit. When the tendency to reversion affects many buds on the same\r\ntree, it becomes covered with different kinds of leaves, flowers, or\r\nfruit; but there is reason to believe that such fluctuating varieties\r\nhave generally arisen from seed. It is well known that, out of a number\r\nof seedling varieties, some transmit their character much more truly by\r\nseed than others; so with bud-varieties, some retain their character by\r\nsuccessive buds more truly than others; of which instances have been\r\ngiven with two kinds of variegated Euonymus and with certain kinds of\r\ntulips and pelargoniums. Notwithstanding the sudden production of\r\nbud-varieties, the characters thus acquired are sometimes capable of\r\ntransmission by seminal reproduction: Mr. Rivers has found that\r\nmoss-roses generally reproduce themselves by seed; and the mossy\r\ncharacter has been transferred by crossing from one species of rose to\r\nanother. The Boston nectarine, which appeared as a bud-variation,\r\nproduced by seed a closely allied nectarine. On the other hand,\r\nseedlings from some bud-variations have proved variable to an extreme\r\ndegree.[159] We have also heard, on the authority of Mr. Salter, that\r\nseeds taken from a branch with leaves variegated through bud-variation,\r\ntransmit this character very feebly; whilst many plants, which were\r\nvariegated as seedlings, transmit variegation to a large proportion of\r\ntheir progeny.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been able to collect a good many cases of\r\nbud-variation, as shown in the previous lists, and might probably, by\r\nsearching foreign horticultural works, have collected very many more\r\ncases, yet their total number is as nothing in comparison with that of\r\nseminal varieties. With seedlings raised from the more variable\r\ncultivated plants, the variations are almost infinitely numerous, but\r\ntheir differences are generally slight: only at long intervals of time\r\na strongly marked modification appears. On the other hand, it is a\r\nsingular and inexplicable fact that, when plants vary by buds, the\r\nvariations, though they occur with comparative rarity, are often, or\r\neven generally, strongly pronounced. It struck me that this might\r\nperhaps be a delusion, and that slight changes often occurred in buds,\r\nbut were overlooked or not recorded from being of no value.\r\nAccordingly, I applied to two great authorities on this subject,\r\nnamely, to Mr. Rivers with respect to fruit-trees, and to Mr. Salter\r\nwith respect to flowers. Mr. Rivers is doubtful, but does not remember\r\nhaving noticed very slight variations in fruit-buds. Mr. Salter informs\r\nme that with flowers such do occur, but, if propagated, they generally\r\nlose their new character in the following year; yet he concurs with me\r\nthat bud-variations usually at once assume a decided and permanent\r\ncharacter. We can hardly doubt that this is the rule, when we reflect\r\non such cases as that of the peach, which has been so carefully\r\nobserved, and of which such trifling seminal varieties have been\r\npropagated, yet this tree has repeatedly produced by bud-variation\r\nnectarines, and only twice (as far as I can learn) any other variety,\r\nnamely, the Early and Late Grosse Mignonne peaches; and these differ\r\nfrom the parent-tree in hardly any character except the period of\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, I hear from Mr. Salter that he brings the principle of\r\nselection to bear on variegated plants propagated by buds, and has thus\r\ngreatly improved and fixed several varieties. He informs me that at\r\nfirst a branch often produces variegated leaves on one side alone, and\r\nthat the leaves are marked only with an irregular edging or with a few\r\nlines of white and yellow. To improve and fix such varieties, he finds\r\nit necessary to encourage the buds at the bases of the most distinctly\r\nmarked leaves, and to propagate from them alone. By following with\r\nperseverance this plan during three or four successive seasons, a\r\ndistinct and fixed variety can generally be secured.\r\n\r\nFinally, the facts given in this chapter prove in how close and\r\nremarkable a manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small\r\ncellular mass forming a bud, resemble each other in all their\r\nfunctions—in their power of inheritance with occasional reversion,—and\r\nin their capacity for variation of the same general nature, in\r\nobedience to the same laws. This resemblance, or rather identity of\r\ncharacter, is shown in the most striking manner by the fact that the\r\ncellular tissue of one species or variety, when budded or grafted on\r\nanother, may give rise to a bud having an intermediate character. We\r\nhave seen that variability does not depend on sexual generation, though\r\nmuch more frequently its concomitant than of bud reproduction. We have\r\nseen that bud-variability is not solely dependent on reversion or\r\natavism to long-lost characters, or to those formerly acquired from a\r\ncross, but appears often to be spontaneous. But when we ask ourselves\r\nwhat is the cause of any particular bud-variation, we are lost in\r\ndoubt, being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the\r\nexternal conditions of life as sufficient, and in other cases to feel a\r\nprofound conviction that these have played a quite subordinate part, of\r\nnot more importance than the nature of the spark which ignites a mass\r\nof combustible matter.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Since the publication of the first edition of this work, I have\r\n found that M.

The\r\n conversion of a striped cane into a green cane was not uncommon, but\r\n the change into a red cane universally disbelieved, and that both\r\n events should occur in the same plant incredible. I find, however, in\r\n Fleischman’s ‘Report on Sugar Cultivation in Louisiana for 1848,’ by\r\n the American Patent Office, the circumstance is mentioned, but he says\r\n he never saw it himself.”\r\n\r\n [73] ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1857, p. 662.\r\n\r\n [74] ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1841, p. 814.\r\n\r\n [75] Ibid., 1857, p. 613.\r\n\r\n [76] Ibid., 1857, p. 679. _See also_ Philips ‘Hist. of Vegetables,’\r\n vol. ii. p. 91, for other and similar accounts.)\r\n\r\n [77] ‘Journal of Proc.

We have before seen that 20·3 per cent of its pollen-grains\r\n are ill-formed and worthless. My plant, though growing not above\r\n thirty or forty yards from both parent-species, during some seasons\r\n yielded no good seeds; but in 1866 it was unusually fertile, and its\r\n long racemes produced from one to occasionally even four pods. Many of\r\n the pods contained no good seeds, but generally they contained a\r\n single apparently good seed, sometimes two, and in one case three\r\n seeds. Some of these seeds germinated, and I raised two trees from\r\n them; one resembles the present form; the other has a remarkable dwarf\r\n character with small leaves, but has not yet flowered.\r\n\r\n [98] ‘Annales de la Soc. de l’Hort. de Paris,’ tom. vii. 1830, p. 93.\r\n\r\n [99] An account was given in the ‘Gardener’s Chronicle’ (1857, pp.\r\n 382, 400) of a common laburnum on which grafts of _C. purpureus_ had\r\n been inserted, and which gradually assumed the character of _C.\r\n adami_; but I have little doubt that _C. adami_ had been sold to the\r\n purchaser, who was not a botanist, in the place of _C. purpureus._ I\r\n have ascertained that this occurred in another instance.\r\n\r\n [100] Gallesio, ‘Gli Agrumi dei Giard.

Bronn, in his\r\n ‘Geschichte der Natur,’ 1843, B. ii. s. 127, has collected several\r\n cases with respect to mares, sows, and dogs. Mr. W. C. L. Martin\r\n (‘History of the Dog,’ 1845, p. 104) says he can personally vouch for\r\n the influence of the male parent on subsequent litters by other dogs.\r\n A French poet, Jacques Savary, who wrote in 1665 on dogs, was aware of\r\n this singular fact. Dr. Bowerbank has given us the following striking\r\n case:—A black, hairless Barbary bitch was first accidentally\r\n impregnated by a mongrel spaniel with long brown hair, and she\r\n produced five puppies, three of which were hairless and two covered\r\n with _ short_ brown hair. The next time she was put to a black,\r\n hairless Barbary dog; “but the mischief had been implanted in the\r\n mother, and again about half the litter looked like pure Barbarys, and\r\n the other half like the _short_-haired progeny of the first father.” I\r\n have given in the text one case with pigs; an equally striking one has\r\n been recently published in Germany, ‘Illust. Landwirth. Zeitung,’\r\n 1868, Nov. 17th, p. 143. It is worth notice that farmers in S. Brazil\r\n (as I hear from Fritz Müller), and at the C. of Good Hope (as I have\r\n heard from two trustworthy persons) are convinced that mares which\r\n have once borne mules, when subsequently put to horses, are extremely\r\n liable to produce colts, striped like a mule. Dr. Wilckens, of\r\n Pogarth, gives (‘Jahrbuch Landwirthschaft,’ ii. 1869, p. 325) a\r\n striking and analogous case. A merino ram, having two small lappets or\r\n flaps of skin on the neck, was in the winter of 1861-62 put to several\r\n Merino ewes, all of whom bore lambs with similar flaps on their necks.\r\n The ram was killed in the spring of 1862 and subsequently to his death\r\n the ewes were put to other Merino rams, and in 1863 to Southdown rams,\r\n none of whom ever have neck lappets: nevertheless, even as long\r\n afterwards as 1867, several of these ewes produced lambs bearing these\r\n appendages.\r\n\r\n [153] ‘Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge,’ 1865, p. 59.\r\n\r\n [154] It may be worth while to call attention to the several means by\r\n which flowers and fruit become striped or mottled. Firstly, by the\r\n direct action of the pollen of another variety or species, as in the\r\n cases given of oranges and maize. Secondly, in crosses of the first\r\n generation, when the colours of the two parents do not readily unite,\r\n as with Mirabilis and Dianthus. Thirdly, in crossed plants of a\r\n subsequent generation by reversion, through either bud or seminal\r\n generation. Fourthly, by reversion to a character not originally\r\n gained by a cross, but which had long been lost, as with\r\n white-flowered varieties, which we shall hereafter see often become\r\n striped with some other colour. Lastly, there are cases, as when\r\n peaches are produced with a half or quarter of the fruit like a\r\n nectarine, in which the change is apparently due to mere variation,\r\n through either bud or seminal generation.\r\n\r\n [155] ‘Production des Variétés,’ p. 37.\r\n\r\n [156] ‘Flora Anomala,’ p. 164.\r\n\r\n [157] ‘Schriften der physisch-okon.

INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL NATURE OF INHERITANCE—PEDIGREES OF OUR DOMESTICATED\r\nANIMALS—INHERITANCE NOT DUE TO CHANCE—TRIFLING CHARACTERS\r\nINHERITED—DISEASES INHERITED—PECULIARITIES IN THE EYE\r\nINHERITED—DISEASES IN THE HORSE—LONGEVITY AND VIGOUR—ASYMMETRICAL\r\nDEVIATIONS OF STRUCTURE—POLYDACTYLISM AND REGROWTH OF SUPERNUMERARY\r\nDIGITS AFTER AMPUTATION—CASES OF SEVERAL CHILDREN SIMILARLY AFFECTED\r\nFROM NON-AFFECTED PARENTS—WEAK AND FLUCTUATING INHERITANCE: IN WEEPING\r\nTREES, IN DWARFNESS, COLOUR OF FRUIT AND FLOWERS—COLOUR OF\r\nHORSES—NON-INHERITANCE IN CERTAIN CASES—INHERITANCE OF STRUCTURE AND\r\nHABITS OVERBORNE BY HOSTILE CONDITIONS OF LIFE, BY INCESSANTLY\r\nRECURRING VARIABILITY, AND BY REVERSION—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of inheritance is an immense one, and has been treated by\r\nmany authors. One work alone, ‘De l’Hérédité Naturelle’ by Dr. Prosper\r\nLucas, runs to the length of 1562 pages. We must confine ourselves to\r\ncertain points which have an important bearing on the general subject\r\nof variation, both with domestic and natural productions. It is obvious\r\nthat a variation which is not inherited throws no light on the\r\nderivation of species, nor is of any service to man, except in the case\r\nof perennial plants, which can be propagated by buds.\r\n\r\nIf animals and plants had never been domesticated, and wild ones alone\r\nhad been observed, we should probably never have heard the saying, that\r\n“like begets like.” The proposition would have been as self-evident as\r\nthat all the buds on the same tree are alike, though neither\r\nproposition is strictly true. For, as has often been remarked, probably\r\nno two individuals are identically the same. All wild animals recognise\r\neach other, which shows that there is some difference between them; and\r\nwhen the eye is well practised, the shepherd knows each sheep, and man\r\ncan distinguish a fellow-man out of millions on millions of other men.\r\nSome authors have gone so far as to maintain that the production of\r\nslight differences is as much a necessary function of the powers of\r\ngeneration, as the production of offspring like their parents. This\r\nview, as we shall see in a future chapter, is not theoretically\r\nprobable, though practically it holds good. The saying that “like\r\nbegets like” has, in fact, arisen from the perfect confidence felt by\r\nbreeders, that a superior or inferior animal will generally reproduce\r\nits kind; but this very superiority or inferiority shows that the\r\nindividual in question has departed slightly from its type.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of inheritance is wonderful. When a new character\r\narises, whatever its nature may be, it generally tends to be inherited,\r\nat least in a temporary and sometimes in a most persistent manner. What\r\ncan be more wonderful than that some trifling peculiarity, not\r\nprimordially attached to the species, should be transmitted through the\r\nmale or female sexual cells, which are so minute as not to be visible\r\nto the naked eye, and afterwards through the incessant changes of a\r\nlong course of development, undergone either in the womb or in the egg,\r\nand ultimately appear in the offspring when mature, or even when quite\r\nold, as in the case of certain diseases? Or again, what can be more\r\nwonderful than the well-ascertained fact that the minute ovule of a\r\ngood milking cow will produce a male, from whom a cell, in union with\r\nan ovule, will produce a female, and she, when mature, will have large\r\nmammary glands, yielding an abundant supply of milk, and even milk of a\r\nparticular quality? Nevertheless, the real subject of surprise is, as\r\nSir H. Holland has well remarked,[1] not that a character should be\r\ninherited, but that any should ever fail to be inherited. In a future\r\nchapter, devoted to an hypothesis which I have termed pangenesis, an\r\nattempt will be made to show the means by which characters of all kinds\r\nare transmitted from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nSome writers,[2] who have not attended to natural history, have\r\nattempted to show that the force of inheritance has been much\r\nexaggerated. The breeders of animals would smile at such simplicity;\r\nand if they condescended to make any answer, might ask what would be\r\nthe chance of winning a prize if two inferior animals were paired\r\ntogether? They might ask whether the half-wild Arabs were led by\r\ntheoretical notions to keep pedigrees of their horses? Why have\r\npedigrees been scrupulously kept and published of the Shorthorn cattle,\r\nand more recently of the Hereford breed? Is it an illusion that these\r\nrecently improved animals safely transmit their excellent qualities\r\neven when crossed with other breeds? have the Shorthorns, without good\r\nreason, been purchased at immense prices and exported to almost every\r\nquarter of the globe, a thousand guineas having been given for a bull?\r\nWith greyhounds pedigrees have likewise been kept, and the names of\r\nsuch dogs, as Snowball, Major, etc., are as well known to coursers as\r\nthose of Eclipse and Herod on the turf. Even with the Gamecock,\r\npedigrees of famous strains were formerly kept, and extended back for a\r\ncentury. With pigs, the Yorkshire and Cumberland breeders “preserve and\r\nprint pedigrees;” and to show how such highly-bred animals are valued,\r\nI may mention that Mr. Brown, who won all the first prizes for small\r\nbreeds at Birmingham in 1850, sold a young sow and boar of his breed to\r\nLord Ducie for 43 guineas; the sow alone was afterwards sold to the\r\nRev. F. Thursby for 65 guineas; who writes, “She paid me very well,\r\nhaving sold her produce for 300 pounds, and having now four breeding\r\nsows from her.”[3] Hard cash paid down, over and over again, is an\r\nexcellent test of inherited superiority. In fact, the whole art of\r\nbreeding, from which such great results have been attained during the\r\npresent century, depends on the inheritance of each small detail of\r\nstructure. But inheritance is not certain; for if it were, the\r\nbreeder’s art[4] would be reduced to a certainty, and there would be\r\nlittle scope left for that wonderful skill and perseverance shown by\r\nthe men who have left an enduring monument of their success in the\r\npresent state of our domesticated animals.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible, within a moderate compass, to impress on the\r\nmind of those who have not attended to the subject, the full conviction\r\nof the force of inheritance which is slowly acquired by rearing\r\nanimals, by studying the many treatises which have been published on\r\nthe various domestic animals, and by conversing with breeders. I will\r\nselect a few facts of the kind, which, as far as I can judge, have most\r\ninfluenced my own mind. With man and the domestic animals, certain\r\npeculiarities have appeared in an individual, at rare intervals, or\r\nonly once or twice in the history of the world, but have reappeared in\r\nseveral of the children and grandchildren. Thus Lambert, “the\r\nporcupine-man,” whose skin was thickly covered with warty projections,\r\nwhich were periodically moulted, had all his six children and two\r\ngrandsons similarly affected.[5] The face and body being covered with\r\nlong hair, accompanied by deficient teeth (to which I shall hereafter\r\nrefer), occurred in three successive generations in a Siamese family;\r\nbut this case is not unique, as a woman[6] with a completely hairy face\r\nwho was exhibited in London in 1663, and another instance has recently\r\noccurred. Colonel Hallam[7] has described a race of two-legged pigs,\r\n“the hinder extremities being entirely wanting;” and this deficiency\r\nwas transmitted through three generations. In fact, all races\r\npresenting any remarkable peculiarity, such as solid-hoofed swine,\r\nMauchamp sheep, niata cattle, etc., are instances of the long-continued\r\ninheritance of rare deviations of structure.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that certain extraordinary peculiarities have thus\r\nappeared in a single individual out of many millions, all exposed in\r\nthe same country to the same general conditions of life, and, again,\r\nthat the same extraordinary peculiarity has sometimes appeared in\r\nindividuals living under widely different conditions of life, we are\r\ndriven to conclude that such peculiarities are not directly due to the\r\naction of the surrounding conditions, but to unknown laws acting on the\r\norganisation or constitution of the individual;—that their production\r\nstands in hardly closer relation to the conditions of life than does\r\nlife itself. If this be so, and the occurrence of the same unusual\r\ncharacter in the child and parent cannot be attributed to both having\r\nbeen exposed to the same unusual conditions, then the following problem\r\nis worth consideration, as showing that the result cannot be due, as\r\nsome authors have supposed, to mere coincidence, but must be consequent\r\non the members of the same family inheriting something in common in\r\ntheir constitution. Let it be assumed that, in a large population, a\r\nparticular affection occurs on an average in one out of a million, so\r\nthat the _à priori_ chance that an individual taken at random will be\r\nso affected is only one in a million. Let the population consist of\r\nsixty millions, composed, we will assume, of ten million families, each\r\ncontaining six members. On these data, Professor Stokes has calculated\r\nfor me that the odds will be no less than 8333 millions to 1 that in\r\nthe ten million families there will not be even a single family in\r\nwhich one parent and two children will be affected by the peculiarity\r\nin question. But numerous instances could be given, in which several\r\nchildren have been affected by the same rare peculiarity with one of\r\ntheir parents; and in this case, more especially if the grandchildren\r\nbe included in the calculation, the odds against mere coincidence\r\nbecome something prodigious, almost beyond enumeration.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the evidence of inheritance is more striking when we\r\nconsider the reappearance of trifling peculiarities. Dr. Hodgkin\r\nformerly told me of an English family in which, for many generations,\r\nsome members had a single lock differently coloured from the rest of\r\nthe hair. I knew an Irish gentleman, who, on the right side of his\r\nhead, had a small white lock in the midst of his dark hair: he assured\r\nme that his grandmother had a similar lock on the same side, and his\r\nmother on the opposite side. But it is superfluous to give instances;\r\nevery shade of expression, which may often be seen alike in parents and\r\nchildren, tells the same story. On what a curious combination of\r\ncorporeal structure, mental character, and training, handwriting\r\ndepends! yet every one must have noted the occasional close similarity\r\nof the handwriting in father and son, although the father had not\r\ntaught his son. A great collector of autographs assured me that in his\r\ncollection there were several signatures of father and son hardly\r\ndistinguishable except by their dates. Hofacker, in Germany, remarks on\r\nthe inheritance of handwriting; and it has even been asserted that\r\nEnglish boys when taught to write in France naturally cling to their\r\nEnglish manner of writing; but for so extraordinary a statement more\r\nevidence is requisite.[8] Gait, gestures, voice, and general bearing\r\nare all inherited, as the illustrious Hunter and Sir A. Carlisle have\r\ninsisted.[9] My father communicated to me some striking instances, in\r\none of which a man died during the early infancy of his son, and my\r\nfather, who did not see this son until grown up and out of health,\r\ndeclared that it seemed to him as if his old friend had risen from the\r\ngrave, with all his highly peculiar habits and manners. Peculiar\r\nmanners pass into tricks, and several instances could be given of their\r\ninheritance; as in the case, often quoted, of the father who generally\r\nslept on his back, with his right leg crossed over the left, and whose\r\ndaughter, whilst an infant in the cradle, followed exactly the same\r\nhabit, though an attempt was made to cure her.[10] I will give one\r\ninstance which has fallen under my own observation, and which is\r\ncurious from being a trick associated with a peculiar state of mind,\r\nnamely, pleasureable emotion. A boy had the singular habit, when\r\npleased, of rapidly moving his fingers parallel to each other, and,\r\nwhen much excited, of raising both hands, with the fingers still\r\nmoving, to the sides of his face on a level with the eyes; when this\r\nboy was almost an old man, he could still hardly resist this trick when\r\nmuch pleased, but from its absurdity concealed it. He had eight\r\nchildren. Of these, a girl, when pleased, at the age of four and a half\r\nyears, moved her fingers in exactly the same way, and what is still\r\nodder, when much excited, she raised both her hands, with her fingers\r\nstill moving, to the sides of her face, in exactly the same manner as\r\nher father had done, and sometimes even still continued to do so when\r\nalone. I never heard of any one, excepting this one man and his little\r\ndaughter, who had this strange habit; and certainly imitation was in\r\nthis instance out of the question.\r\n\r\nSome writers have doubted whether those complex mental attributes, on\r\nwhich genius and talent depend, are inherited, even when both parents\r\nare thus endowed. But he who will study Mr. Galton’s able work on\r\n‘Hereditary Genius’ will have its doubts allayed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it matters not, as far as inheritance is concerned, how\r\ninjurious a quality or structure may be if compatible with life. No one\r\ncan read the many treatises[11] on hereditary disease and doubt this.\r\nThe ancients were strongly of this opinion, or, as Ranchin expresses\r\nit, _Omnes Grœci, Arabes, et Latini in eo consentiunt._ A long\r\ncatalogue could be given of all sorts of inherited malformations and of\r\npredisposition to various diseases. With gout, fifty per cent of the\r\ncases observed in hospital practice are, according to Dr. Garrod,\r\ninherited, and a greater percentage in private practice. Every one\r\nknows how often insanity runs in families, and some of the cases given\r\nby Mr. Sedgwick are awful,—as of a surgeon, whose brother, father, and\r\nfour paternal uncles were all insane, the latter dying by suicide; of a\r\nJew, whose father, mother, and six brothers and sisters were all mad;\r\nand in some other cases several members of the same family, during\r\nthree or four successive generations, have committed suicide. Striking\r\ninstances have been recorded of epilepsy, consumption, asthma, stone in\r\nthe bladder, cancer, profuse bleeding from the slightest injuries, of\r\nthe mother not giving milk, and of bad parturition being inherited. In\r\nthis latter respect I may mention an odd case given by a good\r\nobserver,[12] in which the fault lay in the offspring, and not in the\r\nmother: in a part of Yorkshire the farmers continued to select cattle\r\nwith large hind-quarters, until they made a strain called\r\n“Dutch-buttocked,” and “the monstrous size of the buttocks of the calf\r\nwas frequently fatal to the cow, and numbers of cows were annually lost\r\nin calving.”\r\n\r\nInstead of giving numerous details on various inherited malformations\r\nand diseases, I will confine myself to one organ, that which is the\r\nmost complex, delicate, and probably best-known in the human frame,\r\nnamely, the eye, with its accessory parts.[13] To begin with the\r\nlatter: I have received an account of a family in which one parent and\r\nthe children are affected by drooping eyelids, in so peculiar a manner,\r\nthat they cannot see without throwing their heads backwards. Mr. Wade,\r\nof Wakefield, has given me an analogous case of a man who had not his\r\neyelids thus affected at birth, nor owed their state, as far as was\r\nknown, to inheritance, but they began to droop whilst he was an infant\r\nafter suffering from fits, and he has transmitted the affection to two\r\nout of his three children, as was evident in the photographs of the\r\nwhole family sent to me together with this account. Sir A. Carlisle[14]\r\nspecifies a pendulous fold to the eyelids, as inherited. “In a family,”\r\nsays Sir H. Holland,[15] “where the father had a singular elongation of\r\nthe upper eyelid, seven or eight children were born with the same\r\ndeformity; two or three other children having it not.” Many persons, as\r\nI hear from Sir J. Paget, have two or three hairs in their eyebrows\r\nmuch longer than the others; and even so trifling a peculiarity as this\r\ncertainly runs in families.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the eye itself, the highest authority in England, Mr.\r\nBowman, has been so kind as to give me the following remarks on certain\r\ninherited imperfections. First, hypermetropia, or morbidly long sight:\r\nin this affection, the organ, instead of being spherical, is too flat\r\nfrom front to back, and is often altogether too small, so that the\r\nretina is brought too forward for the focus of the humours;\r\nconsequently a convex glass is required for clear vision of near\r\nobjects, and frequently even of distant ones. This state occurs\r\ncongenitally, or at a very early age, often in several children of the\r\nsame family, where one of the parents has presented it.[16] Secondly,\r\nmyopia, or short-sight, in which the eye is egg-shaped and too long\r\nfrom front to back; the retina in this case lies behind the focus, and\r\nis therefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects. This\r\ncondition is not commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the\r\nliability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to\r\nchild. The change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the\r\nimmediate consequence of something like inflammation of the coats,\r\nunder which they yield, and there is ground for believing that it may\r\noften originate in causes acting on the individual affected,[17] and\r\nmay thenceforward become transmissible. When both parents are myopic\r\nMr. Bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this direction to be\r\nheightened, and some of the children to be myopic at an earlier age or\r\nin a higher degree than their parents. Thirdly, squinting is a familiar\r\nexample of hereditary transmission: it is frequently a result of such\r\noptical defects as have been above mentioned; but the more primary and\r\nuncomplicated forms of it are also sometimes in a marked degree\r\ntransmitted in a family. Fourthly, _Cataract,_ or opacity of the\r\ncrystalline lens, is commonly observed in persons whose parents have\r\nbeen similarly affected, and often at an earlier age in the children\r\nthan in the parents. Occasionally more than one child in a family is\r\nthus afflicted, one of whose parents or other relations, presents the\r\nsenile form of the complaint. When cataract affects several members of\r\na family in the same generation, it is often seen to commence at about\r\nthe same age in each: _e.g.,_ in one family several infants or young\r\npersons may suffer from it; in another, several persons of middle age.\r\nMr. Bowman also informs me that he has occasionally seen, in several\r\nmembers of the same family, various defects in either the right or left\r\neye; and Mr. White Cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision\r\nconfined to one eye reappearing in the same eye in the offspring.[18]\r\n\r\nThe following cases are taken from an able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick,\r\nand from Dr. Prosper Lucas.[19] Amaurosis, either congenital or coming\r\non late in life, and causing total blindness, is often inherited; it\r\nhas been observed in three successive generations. Congenital absence\r\nof the iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations, a\r\ncleft-iris for four generations, being limited in this latter case to\r\nthe males of the family. Opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness\r\nof the eyes have been inherited. Portal records a curious case, in\r\nwhich a father and two sons were rendered blind, whenever the head was\r\nbent downwards, apparently owing to the crystalline lens, with its\r\ncapsule, slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior\r\nchamber of the eye. Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright\r\nlight, is inherited, as is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see\r\nexcept under a strong light: a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of\r\nthis latter defect having affected eighty-five members of the same\r\nfamily during six generations. The singular incapacity of\r\ndistinguishing colours, which has been called _Daltonism,_ is\r\nnotoriously hereditary, and has been traced through five generations,\r\nin which it was confined to the female sex.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the colour of the iris: deficiency of colouring matter\r\nis well known to be hereditary in albinoes. The iris of one eye being\r\nof different colour from that of the other, and the iris being spotted,\r\nare cases which have been inherited. Mr. Sedgwick gives, in addition,\r\non the authority of Dr. Osborne,[20] the following curious instance of\r\nstrong inheritance: a family of sixteen sons and five daughters all had\r\neyes “resembling in miniature the markings on the back of a\r\ntortoiseshell cat.” The mother of this large family had three sisters\r\nand a brother all similarly marked, and they derived this peculiarity\r\nfrom their mother, who belonged to a family notorious for transmitting\r\nit to their posterity.\r\n\r\nFinally, Dr. Lucas emphatically remarks that there is not one single\r\nfaculty of the eye which is not subject to anomalies; and not one which\r\nis not subjected to the principle of inheritance. Mr. Bowman agrees\r\nwith the general truth of this proposition; which of course does not\r\nimply that all malformations are necessarily inherited; this would not\r\neven follow if both parents were affected by an anomaly which in most\r\ncases was transmissible.\r\n\r\nEven if no single fact had been known with respect to the inheritance\r\nof disease and malformations by man, the evidence would have been ample\r\nin the case of the horse. And this might have been expected, as horses\r\nbreed much quicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly\r\nvalued. I have consulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by\r\nveterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid\r\ntendencies is surprising. Authors who have had wide experience give in\r\ndetail many singular cases, and assert that contracted feet, with the\r\nnumerous contingent evils, of ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin,\r\nfounder and weakness of the front legs, roaring or broken and thick\r\nwind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and blindness (the great French\r\nveterinary Huzard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon\r\nbe formed), crib-biting, jibbing and ill-temper, are all plainly\r\nhereditary. Youatt sums up by saying “there is scarcely a malady to\r\nwhich the horse is subject which is not hereditary;” and M. Bernard\r\nadds that the doctrine “that there is scarcely a disease which does not\r\nrun in the stock, is gaining new advocates every day.”[21] So it is in\r\nregard to cattle, with consumption, good and bad teeth, fine skin, etc.\r\netc. But enough, and more than enough, has been said on disease. Andrew\r\nKnight, from his own experience, asserts that disease is hereditary\r\nwith plants; and this assertion is endorsed by Lindley.[22]\r\n\r\nSeeing how hereditary evil qualities are, it is fortunate that good\r\nhealth, vigour, and longevity are equally inherited. It was formerly a\r\nwell-known practice, when annuities were purchased to be received\r\nduring the life-time of a nominee, to search out a person belonging to\r\na family of which many members had lived to extreme old age. As to the\r\ninheritance of vigour and endurance, the English race-horse offers an\r\nexcellent instance. Eclipse begot 334, and King Herod 497 winners. A\r\n“cock-tail” is a horse not purely bred, but with only one-eighth, or\r\none-sixteenth impure blood in his veins, yet very few instances have\r\never occurred of such horses having won a great race. They are\r\nsometimes as fleet for short distances as thoroughbreds, but as Mr.\r\nRobson, the great trainer, asserts, they are deficient in wind, and\r\ncannot keep up the pace. Mr. Lawrence also remarks, “perhaps no\r\ninstance has ever occurred of a three-part-bred horse saving his _\r\n‘distance’_ in running two miles with thoroughbred racers.” It has been\r\nstated by Cecil, that when unknown horses, whose parents were not\r\ncelebrated, have unexpectedly won great races, as in the case of Priam,\r\nthey can always be proved to be descended, on both sides, through many\r\ngenerations, from first-rate ancestors. On the Continent, Baron\r\nCameronn challenges, in a German veterinary periodical, the opponents\r\nof the English race-horse to name one good horse on the Continent,\r\nwhich has not some English race-blood in his veins.[23]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the transmission of the many slight, but infinitely\r\ndiversified characters, by which the domestic races of animals and\r\nplants are distinguished, nothing need be said; for the very existence\r\nof persistent races proclaims the power of inheritance.\r\n\r\nA few special cases, however, deserve some consideration. It might have\r\nbeen anticipated, that deviations from the law of symmetry would not\r\nhave been inherited. But Anderson[24] states that a rabbit produced in\r\na litter a young animal having only one ear; and from this animal a\r\nbreed was formed which steadily produced one-eared rabbits. He also\r\nmentions a bitch with a single leg deficient, and she produced several\r\npuppies with the same deficiency. From Hofacker’s account,[25] it\r\nappears that a one-horned stag was seen in 1781 in a forest in Germany,\r\nin 1788 two, and afterwards, from year to year, many were observed with\r\nonly one horn on the right side of the head. A cow lost a horn by\r\nsuppuration,[26] and she produced three calves which had on the same\r\nside of the head, instead of a horn, a small bony lump attached merely\r\nto the skin; but we here encroach on the subject of inherited\r\nmutilations. A man who is left-handed, and a shell in which the spire\r\nturns in the wrong directions, are departures from the normal\r\nasymmetrical condition, and they are well-known to be inherited.\r\n\r\n_Polydactylism._—Supernumerary fingers and toes are eminently liable,\r\nas various authors have insisted, to be inherited. Polydactylism\r\ngraduates[27] by multifarious steps from a mere cutaneous appendage,\r\nnot including any bone, to a double hand. But an additional digit,\r\nsupported on a metacarpal bone, and furnished with all the proper\r\nmuscles, nerves, and vessels, is sometimes so perfect, that it escapes\r\ndetection, unless the fingers are actually counted. Occasionally there\r\nare several supernumerary digits; but usually only one, making the\r\ntotal number six. This one may be attached to the inner or outer margin\r\nof the hand, representing either a thumb or little finger, the latter\r\nbeing the more frequent. Generally, through the law of correlation,\r\nboth hands and both feet are similarly affected. Dr. Burt Wilder has\r\ntabulated[28] a large number of cases, and finds that supernumerary\r\ndigits are more common on the hands than on the feet, and that men are\r\naffected oftener than women. Both these facts can be explained on two\r\nprinciples which seem generally to hold good; firstly, that of two\r\nparts, the more specialised one is the more variable, and the arm is\r\nmore highly specialised than the leg; and secondly that male animals\r\nare more variable than females.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a greater number of digits than five is a great\r\nanomaly, for this number is not normally exceeded by any existing\r\nmammal, bird, or reptile. Nevertheless, supernumerary digits are\r\nstrongly inherited; they have been transmitted through five\r\ngenerations; and in some cases, after disappearing for one, two, or\r\neven three generations, have reappeared through reversion. These facts\r\nare rendered, as Professor Huxley has observed, more remarkable from\r\nits being known in most cases that the affected person has not married\r\none similarly affected. In such cases the child of the fifth generation\r\nwould have only 1-32nd part of the blood of his first sedigitated\r\nancestor. Other cases are rendered remarkable by the affection\r\ngathering force, as Dr. Struthers has shown, in each generation, though\r\nin each the affected person married one not affected; moreover, such\r\nadditional digits are often amputated soon after birth, and can seldom\r\nhave been strengthened by use. Dr. Struthers gives the following\r\ninstance: in the first generation an additional digit appeared on one\r\nhand; in the second, on both hands; in the third, three brothers had\r\nboth hands, and one of the brothers a foot affected; and in the fourth\r\ngeneration all four limbs were affected. Yet we must not over-estimate\r\nthe force of inheritance. Dr. Struthers asserts that cases of\r\nnon-inheritance and of the first appearance of additional digits in\r\nunaffected families are much more frequent than cases of inheritance.\r\nMany other deviations of structure, of a nature almost as anomalous as\r\nsupernumerary digits, such as deficient phalanges,[29] thickened\r\njoints, crooked fingers, etc., are, in like manner, strongly inherited,\r\nand are equally subject to intermission, together with reversion,\r\nthough in such cases there is no reason to suppose that both parents\r\nhad been similarly affected.[30]\r\n\r\nAdditional digits have been observed in negroes as well as in other\r\nraces of man, and in several of the lower animals, and have been\r\ninherited. Six toes have been described on the hind feet of the newt\r\n(_Salamandra cristata_), and are said to have occurred with the frog.\r\nIt deserves notice, that the six-toed newt, though adult, preserved\r\nsome of its larval characters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus, which\r\nis properly absorbed during the act of metamorphosis, was retained. It\r\nis also remarkable that in the case of man various structures in an\r\nembryonic or arrested state of development, such as a cleft-palate,\r\nbifid uterus, etc., are often accompanied by polydactylism.[31] Six\r\ntoes on the hinder feet are known to have been inherited for three\r\ngenerations of cats. In several breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is\r\ndouble, and is generally transmitted truly, as is well shown when\r\nDorkings are crossed with common four-toed breeds.[32] With animals\r\nwhich have properly less than five digits, the number is sometimes\r\nincreased to five, especially on the front legs, though rarely carried\r\nbeyond that number; but this is due to the development of a digit\r\nalready existing in a more or less rudimentary state. Thus, the dog has\r\nproperly four toes behind, but in the larger breeds a fifth toe is\r\ncommonly, though not perfectly, developed. Horses, which properly have\r\none toe alone fully developed with rudiments of the others, have been\r\ndescribed with each foot bearing two or three small separate hoofs:\r\nanalogous facts have been noticed with cows, sheep, goats, and\r\npigs.[33]\r\n\r\nThere is a famous case described by Mr. White of a child, three years\r\nold, with a thumb double from the first joint. He removed the lesser\r\nthumb, which was furnished with a nail; but to his astonishment it grew\r\nagain and reproduced a nail. The child was then taken to an eminent\r\nLondon surgeon, and the newly-grown thumb was removed by its\r\nsocket-joint, but again it grew and reproduced a nail. Dr. Struthers\r\nmentions a case of the partial regrowth of an additional thumb,\r\namputated when a child was three months old; and the late Dr. Falconer\r\ncommunicated to me an analogous instance. In the last edition of this\r\nwork I also gave a case of the regrowth of a supernumerary\r\nlittle-finger after amputation; but having been informed by Dr.\r\nBachmaier that several eminent surgeons expressed, at a meeting of the\r\nAnthropological Society of Munich, great doubt about my statements, I\r\nhave made more particular inquiries. The full information thus gained,\r\ntogether with a tracing of the hand in its present state, has been laid\r\nbefore Sir J. Paget, and he has come to the conclusion that the degree\r\nof regrowth in this case is not greater than sometimes occurs with\r\nnormal bones, especially with the humerus, when amputated at an early\r\nage. He further does not feel fully satisfied about the facts recorded\r\nby Mr. White. This being so, it is necessary for me to withdraw the\r\nview which I formerly advanced, with much hesitation, chiefly on the\r\nground of the supposed regrowth of additional digits, namely, that\r\ntheir occasional development in man is a case of reversion to a lowly,\r\norganised progenitor provided with more than five digits.\r\n\r\nI may here allude to a class of facts closely allied to, but somewhat\r\ndifferent from, ordinary cases of inheritance. Sir H. Holland[34]\r\nstates that brothers and sisters of the same family are frequently\r\naffected, often at about the same age, by the same peculiar disease,\r\nnot known to have previously occurred in the family. He specifies the\r\noccurrence of diabetes in three brothers under ten years old; he also\r\nremarks that children of the same family often exhibit in common\r\ninfantile diseases, the same peculiar symptoms. My father mentioned to\r\nme the case of four brothers who died between the ages of sixty and\r\nseventy, in the same highly peculiar comatose state. An instance has\r\nalready been given of supernumerary digits appearing in four children\r\nout of six in a previously unaffected family. Dr. Devay states[35] that\r\ntwo brothers married two sisters, their first-cousins, none of the four\r\nnor any relation being an albino; but the seven children produced from\r\nthis double marriage were all perfect albinoes. Some of these cases, as\r\nMr. Sedgwick[36] has shown, are probably the result of reversion to a\r\nremote ancestor, of whom no record had been preserved; and all these\r\ncases are so far directly connected with inheritance that no doubt the\r\nchildren inherited a similar constitution from their parents, and, from\r\nbeing exposed to nearly similar conditions of life, it is not\r\nsurprising that they should be affected in the same manner and at the\r\nsame period of life.\r\n\r\nMost of the facts hitherto given have served to illustrate the force of\r\ninheritance, but we must now consider cases grouped as well as the\r\nsubject allows into classes, showing how feeble, capricious, or\r\ndeficient the power of inheritance sometimes is. When a new peculiarity\r\nfirst appears, we can never predict whether it will be inherited. If\r\nboth parents from their birth present the same peculiarity, the\r\nprobability is strong that it will be transmitted to at least some of\r\ntheir offspring. We have seen that variegation is transmitted much more\r\nfeebly by seed, taken from a branch which had become variegated through\r\nbud-variation, than from plants which were variegated as seedlings.\r\nWith most plants the power of transmission notoriously depends on some\r\ninnate capacity in the individual: thus Vilmorin[37] raised from a\r\npeculiarly coloured balsam some seedlings, which all resembled their\r\nparent; but of these seedlings some failed to transmit the new\r\ncharacter, whilst others transmitted it to all their descendants during\r\nseveral successive generations. So again with a variety of the rose,\r\ntwo plants alone out of six were found by Vilmorin to be capable of\r\ntransmitting the desired character; numerous analogous cases could be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe weeping or pendulous growth of trees is strongly inherited in some\r\ncases, and, without any assignable reason, feebly in other cases. I\r\nhave selected this character as an instance of capricious inheritance,\r\nbecause it is certainly not proper to the parent-species, and because,\r\nboth sexes being borne on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same\r\ncharacter. Even supposing that there may have been in some instances\r\ncrossing with adjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable\r\nthat all the seedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court\r\nthere is a famous weeping oak; many of its branches “are 30 feet long,\r\nand no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope:” this\r\ntree transmits its weeping character, in a greater or less degree, to\r\nall its seedlings; some of the young oaks being so flexible that they\r\nhave to be supported by props; others not showing the weeping tendency\r\ntill about twenty years old.[38] Mr. Rivers fertilised, as he informs\r\nme, the flowers of a new Belgian weeping thorn (_Cratægus oxyacantha_)\r\nwith pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety, and three young trees,\r\n“now six or seven years old, show a decided tendency to be pendulous,\r\nbut as yet are not so much so as the mother-plant.” According to Mr.\r\nMacNab,[39] seedlings from a magnificent weeping birch (_Betula alba_),\r\nin the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, grew for the first ten or fifteen\r\nyears upright, but then all became weepers like their parent. A peach\r\nwith pendulous branches, like those of the weeping willow, has been\r\nfound capable of propagation by seed.[40] Lastly, a weeping or rather a\r\nprostrate yew (_Taxus baccata_) was found in a hedge in Shropshire; it\r\nwas a male, but one branch bore female flowers, and produced berries;\r\nthese, being sown, produced seventeen trees all of which had exactly\r\nthe same peculiar habit with the parent-tree.[41]\r\n\r\nThese facts, it might have been thought, would have been sufficient to\r\nrender it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be\r\nstrictly inherited. But let us look to the other side. Mr. MacNab[42]\r\nsowed seeds of the weeping beech (_Fagus sylvatica_), but succeeded in\r\nraising only common beeches. Mr. Rivers, at my request, raised a number\r\nof seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm; and at least\r\none of the parent-trees was so situated that it could not have been\r\ncrossed by any other elm; but none of the young trees, now about a foot\r\nor two in height, show the least signs of weeping. Mr. Rivers formerly\r\nsowed above twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash (_Fraxinus\r\nexcelsior_), and not a single seedling was in the least degree\r\npendulous: in Germany, M. Borchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings, with\r\nthe same result. Nevertheless, Mr. Anderson, of the Chelsea Botanic\r\nGarden, by sowing seed from a weeping ash, which was found before the\r\nyear 1780, in Cambridgeshire, raised several pendulous trees.[43]\r\nProfessor Henslow also informs me that some seedlings from a female\r\nweeping ash in the Botanic Garden at Cambridge were at first a little\r\npendulous, but afterwards became quite upright: it is probable that\r\nthis latter tree, which transmits to a certain extent its pendulous\r\nhabit, was derived by a bud from the same original Cambridgeshire\r\nstock; whilst other weeping ashes may have had a distinct origin. But\r\nthe crowning case, communicated to me by Mr. Rivers, which shows how\r\ncapricious is the inheritance of a pendulous habit, is that a variety\r\nof another species of ash (_F. lentiscifolia_), now about twenty years\r\nold, which was formerly pendulous, “has long lost this habit, every\r\nshoot being remarkably erect; but seedlings formerly raised from it\r\nwere perfectly prostrate, the stems not rising more than two inches\r\nabove the ground.” Thus the weeping variety of the common ash, which\r\nhas been extensively propagated by buds during a long period, did not\r\nwith Mr. Rivers, transmit its character to one seedling out of above\r\ntwenty thousand; whereas the weeping variety of a second species of\r\nash, which could not, whilst grown in the same garden, retain its own\r\nweeping character, transmitted to its character the pendulous habit in\r\nexcess!\r\n\r\nMany analogous facts could be given, showing how apparently capricious\r\nis the principle of inheritance. All the seedlings from a variety of\r\nthe Barberry (_B. vulgaris_) with red leaves inherited the same\r\ncharacter; only about one-third of the seedlings of the copper Beech\r\n(_Fagus sylvatica_) had purple leaves. Not one out of a hundred\r\nseedlings of a variety of the _Cerasus padus,_ with yellow fruit, bore\r\nyellow fruit: one-twelfth of the seedlings of the variety of _Cornus\r\nmascula,_ with yellow fruit, came true:[44] and lastly, all the trees\r\nraised by my father from a yellow-berried holly (_Ilex aquifolium_),\r\nfound wild, produced yellow berries. Vilmorin[45] observed in a bed of\r\n_Saponaria calabrica_ an extremely dwarf variety, and raised from it a\r\nlarge number of seedlings; some of these partially resembled their\r\nparent, and he selected their seed; but the grandchildren were not in\r\nthe least dwarfed: on the other hand, he observed a stunted and bushy\r\nvariety of _Tagetes signata_ growing in the midst of the common\r\nvarieties by which it was probably crossed; for most of the seedlings\r\nraised from this plant were intermediate in character, only two\r\nperfectly resembling their parent; but seed saved from these two plants\r\nreproduced the new variety so truly, that hardly any selection has\r\nsince been necessary.\r\n\r\nFlowers transmit their colour truly, or most capriciously. Many annuals\r\ncome true: thus I purchased German seeds of thirty-four named\r\nsub-varieties of one _race_ of ten-week stocks (_Matthiola annua_), and\r\nraised a hundred and forty plants, all of which, with the exception of\r\na single plant, came true. In saying this, however, it must be\r\nunderstood that I could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the\r\nthirty-four named sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower\r\nalways correspond with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that\r\nthey came true, because in each of the thirty-six short rows every\r\nplant was absolutely alike, with the one single exception. Again, I\r\nprocured packets of German seed of twenty-five named varieties of\r\ncommon and quilled asters, and raised a hundred and twenty-four plants;\r\nof these, all except ten were true in the above limited sense; and I\r\nconsidered even a wrong shade of colour as false.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance that white varieties generally transmit\r\ntheir colour much more truly than any other variety. This fact probably\r\nstands in close relation with one observed by Verlot,[46] namely, that\r\nflowers which are normally white rarely vary into any other colour. I\r\nhave found that the white varieties of _Delphinium consolida_ and of\r\nthe Stock are the truest. It is, indeed, sufficient to look through a\r\nnurseryman’s seed-list, to see the large number of white varieties\r\nwhich can be propagated by seed. The several coloured varieties of the\r\nsweet-pea (_Lathyrus odoratus_) are very true; but I hear from Mr.\r\nMasters, of Canterbury, who has particularly attended to this plant,\r\nthat the white variety is the truest. The hyacinth, when propagated by\r\nseed, is extremely inconstant in colour, but “white hyacinths almost\r\nalways give by seed white-flowered plants;”[47] and Mr. Masters informs\r\nme that the yellow varieties also reproduce their colour, but of\r\ndifferent shades. On the other hand, pink and blue varieties, the\r\nlatter being the natural colour, are not nearly so true: hence, as Mr.\r\nMasters has remarked to me, “we see that a garden variety may acquire a\r\nmore permanent habit than a natural species;” but it should have been\r\nadded, that this occurs under cultivation, and therefore under changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWith many flowers, especially perennials, nothing can be more\r\nfluctuating than the colour of the seedlings, as is notoriously the\r\ncase with verbenas, carnations, dahlias, cinerarias, and others.[48] I\r\nsowed seed of twelve named varieties of Snapdragon (_Antirrhinum\r\nmajus_), and utter confusion was the result. In most cases the\r\nextremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in chief\r\npart due to crosses between differently-coloured varieties during\r\nprevious generations. It is almost certain that this is the case with\r\nthe polyanthus and coloured primrose (_Primula veris_ and _vulgaris_),\r\nfrom their reciprocally dimorphic structure;[49] and these are plants\r\nwhich florists speak of as never coming true by seed: but if care be\r\ntaken to prevent crossing, neither species is by any means very\r\ninconstant, in colour; thus I raised twenty-three plants from a purple\r\nprimrose, fertilised by Mr. J. Scott with its pollen, and eighteen came\r\nup purple of different shades, and only five reverted to the ordinary\r\nyellow colour: again, I raised twenty plants from a bright-red cowslip,\r\nsimilarly treated by Mr. Scott, and every one perfectly resembled its\r\nparent in colour, as likewise did, with the exception of a single\r\nplant, 72 grandchildren. Even with the most variable flowers, it is\r\nprobable that each delicate shade of colour might be permanently fixed\r\nso as to be transmitted by seed, by cultivation in the same soil, by\r\nlong-continued selection, and especially by the prevention of crosses.\r\nI infer this from certain annual larkspurs (_Delphinium consolida_ and\r\n_ajacis_), of which common seedlings present a greater diversity of\r\ncolour than any other plant known to me; yet on procuring seed of five\r\nnamed German varieties of _D. consolida,_ only nine plants out of\r\nninety-four were false; and the seedlings of six varieties of _D.\r\najacis_ were true in the same manner and degree as with the stocks\r\nabove described. A distinguished botanist maintains that the annual\r\nspecies of Delphinium are always self-fertilised; therefore I may\r\nmention that thirty-two flowers on a branch of _ D. consolida,_\r\nenclosed in a net, yielded twenty-seven capsules, with an average of\r\n17·2 seed in each; whilst five flowers, under the same net, which were\r\nartificially fertilised, in the same manner as must be effected by bees\r\nduring their incessant visits, yielded five capsules with an average of\r\n35·2 fine seed; and this shows that the agency of insects is necessary\r\nfor the full fertility of this plant. Analogous facts could be given\r\nwith respect to the crossing of many other flowers, such as carnations,\r\netc., of which the varieties fluctuate much in colour.\r\n\r\nAs with flowers, so with our domesticated animals, no character is more\r\nvariable than colour, and probably in no animal more so than with the\r\nhorse. Yet, with a little care in breeding, it appears that races of\r\nany colour might soon be formed. Hofacker gives the result of matching\r\ntwo hundred and sixteen mares of four different colours with\r\nlike-coloured stallions, without regard to the colour of their\r\nancestors; and of the two hundred and sixteen colts born, eleven alone\r\nfailed to inherit the colour of their parents: Autenrieth and Ammon\r\nassert that, after two generations, colts of a uniform colour are\r\nproduced with certainty.[50]\r\n\r\nIn a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be inherited, apparently from\r\nthe force of inheritance being too strong. I have been assured by\r\nbreeders of the canary-bird that to get a good jonquil-coloured bird it\r\ndoes not answer to pair two jonquils, as the colour then comes out too\r\nstrong, or is even brown; but this statement is disputed by other\r\nbreeders. So again, if two crested canaries are paired, the young birds\r\nrarely inherit this character:[51] for in crested birds a narrow space\r\nof bare skin is left on the back of the head, where the feathers are\r\nup-turned to form the crest, and, when both parents are thus\r\ncharacterised, the bareness becomes excessive, and the crest itself\r\nfails to be developed. Mr. Hewitt, speaking of Laced Sebright Bantams,\r\nsays[52] that, “why this should be so I know not, but I am confident\r\nthat those that are best laced frequently produce offspring very far\r\nfrom perfect in their markings, whilst those exhibited by myself, which\r\nhave so often proved successful, were bred from the union of\r\nheavily-laced birds with those that were scarcely sufficiently laced.”\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that, although several deaf-mutes often occur in\r\nthe same family, and though their cousins and other relations are often\r\nin the same condition, yet their parents are rarely deaf-mutes. To give\r\na single instance: not one scholar out of 148, who were at the same\r\ntime in the London Institution, was the child of parents similarly\r\naffected. So again, when a male or female deaf-mute marries a sound\r\nperson, their children are most rarely affected: in Ireland, out of 203\r\nchildren thus produced one alone was mute. Even when both parents have\r\nbeen deaf-mutes, as in the case of forty-one marriages in the United\r\nStates and of six in Ireland, only two deaf and dumb children were\r\nproduced. Mr. Sedgwick,[53] in commenting on this remarkable and\r\nfortunate failure in the power of transmission in the direct line,\r\nremarks that it may possibly be owing to “excess having reversed the\r\naction of some natural law in development.” But it is safer in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge to look at the whole case as simply\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\nAlthough many congenital monstrosities are inherited, of which examples\r\nhave already been given, and to which may be added the lately recorded\r\ncase of the transmission during a century of hare-lip with a\r\ncleft-palate in the writer’s own family,[54] yet other malformations\r\nare rarely or never inherited. Of these latter cases, many are probably\r\ndue to injuries in the womb or egg, and would come under the head of\r\nnon-inherited injuries or mutilations. With plants, a long catalogue of\r\ninherited monstrosities of the most serious and diversified nature\r\ncould easily be given; and with plants, there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat monstrosities are caused by direct injuries to the seed or embryo.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries or\r\naltered by disease, it was until lately difficult to come to any\r\ndefinite conclusion. Some mutilations have been practised for a vast\r\nnumber of generations without any inherited result. Godron remarks[55]\r\nthat different races of man have from time immemorial knocked out their\r\nupper incisors, cut off joints of their fingers, made holes of immense\r\nsize through the lobes of their ears or through their nostrils, tatooed\r\nthemselves, made deep gashes in various parts of their bodies, and\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that these mutilations have ever been\r\ninherited.[56] Adhesions due to inflammation and pits from the\r\nsmall-pox (and formerly many consecutive generations must have been\r\nthus pitted) are not inherited. With respect to Jews, I have been\r\nassured by three medical men of the Jewish faith that circumcision,\r\nwhich has been practised for so many ages, has produced no inherited\r\neffect. Blumenbach, however, asserts[57] that Jews are often born in\r\nGermany in a condition rendering circumcision difficult, so that a name\r\nis given them signifying “born circumcised;” and Professor Preyer\r\ninforms me that this is the case in Bonn, such children being\r\nconsidered the special favourites of Jehovah. I have also heard from\r\nDr. A. Newman, of Guy’s Hospital, of the grandson of a circumcised Jew,\r\nthe father not having been circumcised, in a similar condition. But it\r\nis possible that all these cases may be accidental coincidence, for Sir\r\nJ. Paget has seen five sons of a lady and one son of her sister with\r\nadherent prepuces; and one of these boys was affected in a manner\r\n“which might be considered like that commonly produced by\r\ncircumcision;” yet there was no suspicion of Jewish blood in the family\r\nof these two sisters. Circumcision is practised by Mahomedans, but at a\r\nmuch later age than by Jews; and Dr. Riedel, Assistant Resident in\r\nNorth Celebes, writes to me that the boys there go naked until from six\r\nto ten years old; and he has observed that many of them, though not\r\nall, have their prepuces much reduced in length, and this he attributes\r\nto the inherited effects of the operation. In the vegetable kingdom\r\noaks and other trees have borne galls from primeval times, yet they do\r\nnot produce inherited excrescences; and many other such facts could be\r\nadduced.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above several negative cases, we now possess\r\nconclusive evidence that the effects of operations are sometimes\r\ninherited. Dr. Brown-Séquard[58] gives the following summary of his\r\nobservations on guinea-pigs; and this summary is so important that I\r\nwill quote the whole:—\r\n\r\n“1st. Appearance of epilepsy in animals born of parents having been\r\nrendered epileptic by an injury to the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n“2nd. Appearance of epilepsy also in animals born of parents having\r\nbeen rendered epileptic by the section of the sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n“3rd. A change in the shape of the ear in animals born of parents in\r\nwhich such a change was the effect of a division of the cervical\r\nsympathetic nerve.\r\n\r\n“4th. Partial closure of the eyelids in animals born of parents in\r\nwhich that state of the eyelids had been caused either by the section\r\nof the cervical sympathetic nerve or the removal of the superior\r\ncervical ganglion.\r\n\r\n“5th. Exophthalmia in animals born of parents in which an injury to the\r\nrestiform body had produced that protrusion of the eyeball. This\r\ninteresting fact I have witnessed a good many times, and I have seen\r\nthe transmission of the morbid state of the eye continue through four\r\ngenerations. In these animals, modified by heredity, the two eyes\r\ngenerally protruded, although in the parents usually only one showed\r\nexophthalmia, the lesion having been made in most cases only on one of\r\nthe corpora restiformia.\r\n\r\n“6th. Hæmatoma and dry gangrene of the ears in animals born of parents\r\nin which these ear-alterations had been caused by an injury to the\r\nrestiform body near the nib of the calamus.\r\n\r\n“7th. Absence of two toes out of the three of the hind leg, and\r\nsometimes of the three, in animals whose parents had eaten up their\r\nhind-leg toes which had become anæsthetic from a section of the sciatic\r\nnerve alone, or of that nerve and also of the crural. Sometimes,\r\ninstead of complete absence of the toes, only a part of one or two or\r\nthree was missing in the young, although in the parent not only the\r\ntoes but the whole foot was absent (partly eaten off, partly destroyed\r\nby inflammation, ulceration, or gangrene).\r\n\r\n“8th. Appearance of various morbid states of the skin and hair of the\r\nneck and face in animals born of parents having had similar alterations\r\nin the same parts, as effects of an injury to the sciatic nerve.”\r\n\r\nIt should be especially observed that Brown-Séquard has bred during\r\nthirty years many thousand guinea-pigs from animals which had not been\r\noperated upon, and not one of these manifested the epileptic tendency.\r\nNor has he ever seen a guinea-pig born without toes, which was not the\r\noffspring of parents which had gnawed off their own toes owing to the\r\nsciatic nerve having been divided. Of this latter fact thirteen\r\ninstances were carefully recorded, and a greater number were seen; yet\r\nBrown-Séquard speaks of such cases as one of the rarer forms of\r\ninheritance. It is a still more interesting fact—\r\n\r\n“That the sciatic nerve in the congenitally toeless animal has\r\ninherited the power of passing through all the different morbid states\r\nwhich have occurred in one of its parents from the time of the division\r\ntill after its reunion with the peripheric end. It is not therefore\r\nsimply the power of performing an action which is inherited, but the\r\npower of performing a whole series of actions, in a certain order.”\r\n\r\nIn most of the cases of inheritance recorded by Brown-Séquard only one\r\nof the two parents had been operated upon and was affected. He\r\nconcludes by expressing his belief that “what is transmitted is the\r\nmorbid state of the nervous system,” due to the operation performed on\r\nthe parents.\r\n\r\nWith the lower animals Dr. Prosper Lucas has collected a long list of\r\ninherited injuries. A few instances will suffice. A cow lost a horn\r\nfrom an accident with consequent suppuration, and she produced three\r\ncalves which were hornless on the same side of the head. With the\r\nhorse, there seems hardly a doubt that exostoses on the legs, caused by\r\ntoo much travelling on hard roads, are inherited. Blumenbach records\r\nthe case of a man who had his little finger on the right hand almost\r\ncut off, and which in consequence grew crooked, and his sons had the\r\nsame finger on the same hand similarly crooked. A soldier, fifteen\r\nyears before his marriage, lost his left eye from purulent ophthalmia,\r\nand his two sons were microphthalmic on the same side.[59] In all cases\r\nin which a parent has had an organ injured on one side, and two or more\r\nof the offspring are born with the same organ affected on the same\r\nside, the chances against mere coincidence are almost infinitely great.\r\nEven when only a single child is born having exactly the same part of\r\nthe body affected as that of his injured parent, the chances against\r\ncoincidence are great; and Professor Rolleston has given me two such\r\ncases which have fallen under his own observation,—namely of two men,\r\none of whom had his knee and the other his cheek severely cut, and both\r\nhad children born with exactly the same spot marked or scarred. Many\r\ninstances have been recorded of cats, dogs, and horses, which have had\r\ntheir tails, legs, etc., amputated or injured, producing offspring with\r\nthe same parts ill-formed; but as it is not very rare for similar\r\nmalformations to appear spontaneously, all such cases may be due to\r\ncoincidence. It is, however, an argument on the other side that “under\r\nthe old excise laws the shepherd-dog was only exempt from tax when\r\nwithout a tail, and for this reason it was always removed;”[60] and\r\nthere still exist breeds of the shepherd-dog which are always born\r\ndestitute of a tail. Finally, it must be admitted, more especially\r\nsince the publication of Brown-Séquard’s observations, that the effects\r\nof injuries, especially when followed by disease, or perhaps\r\nexclusively when thus followed, are occasionally inherited.[61]\r\n\r\n      _Causes of Non-inheritance._\r\n\r\nA large number of cases of non-inheritance are intelligible on the\r\nprinciple, that a strong tendency to inheritance does exist, but that\r\nit is overborne by hostile or unfavourable conditions of life. No one\r\nwould expect that our improved pigs, if forced during several\r\ngenerations to travel about and root in the ground for their own\r\nsubsistence, would transmit, as truly as they now do their short\r\nmuzzles and legs, and their tendency to fatten. Dray-horses assuredly\r\nwould not long transmit their great size and massive limbs, if\r\ncompelled to live on a cold, damp mountainous region; we have indeed\r\nevidence of such deterioration in the horses which have run wild on the\r\nFalkland Islands. European dogs in India often fail to transmit their\r\ntrue character. Our sheep in tropical countries lose their wool in a\r\nfew generations. There seems also to be a close relation between\r\ncertain peculiar pastures and the inheritance of an enlarged tail in\r\nfat-tailed sheep, which form one of the most ancient breeds in the\r\nworld. With plants, we have seen that tropical varieties of maize lose\r\ntheir proper character in the course of two or three generations, when\r\ncultivated in Europe; and conversely so it is with European varieties\r\ncultivated in Brazil. Our cabbages, which here come so true by seed,\r\ncannot form heads in hot countries. According to Carrière,[62] the\r\npurple-leafed beech and barberry transmit their character by seed far\r\nless truly in certain districts than in others. Under changed\r\ncircumstances, periodical habits of life soon fail to be transmitted,\r\nas the period of maturity in summer and winter wheat, barley, and\r\nvetches. So it is with animals: for instance, a person, whose statement\r\nI can trust, procured eggs of Aylesbury ducks from that town, where\r\nthey are kept in houses and are reared as early as possible for the\r\nLondon market; the ducks bred from these eggs in a distant part of\r\nEngland, hatched their first brood on January 24th, whilst common\r\nducks, kept in the same yard and treated in the same manner, did not\r\nhatch till the end of March; and this shows that the period of hatching\r\nwas inherited. But the grandchildren of these Aylesbury ducks\r\ncompletely lost their habit of early incubation, and hatched their eggs\r\nat the same time with the common ducks of the same place.\r\n\r\nMany cases of non-inheritance apparently result from the conditions of\r\nlife continually inducing fresh variability. We have seen that when the\r\nseeds of pears, plums, apples, etc., are sown, the seedlings generally\r\ninherit some degree of family likeness. Mingled with these seedlings, a\r\nfew, and sometimes many, worthless, wild-looking plants commonly\r\nappear, and their appearance may be attributed to the principle of\r\nreversion. But scarcely a single seedling will be found perfectly to\r\nresemble the parent-form; and thus may be accounted for by constantly\r\nrecurring variability induced by the conditions of life. I believe in\r\nthis, because it has been observed that certain fruit-trees truly\r\npropagate their kind whilst growing on their own roots; but when\r\ngrafted on other stocks, and by this process their natural state is\r\nmanifestly affected, they produce seedlings which vary greatly,\r\ndeparting from the parental type in many characters.[63] Metzger, as\r\nstated in the ninth chapter, found that certain kinds of wheat brought\r\nfrom Spain and cultivated in Germany, failed during many years to\r\nreproduce themselves truly; but at last, when accustomed to their new\r\nconditions, they ceased to be variable,—that is, they became amenable\r\nto the power of inheritance. Nearly all the plants which cannot be\r\npropagated with any approach to certainty by seed, are kinds which have\r\nbeen long propagated by buds, cuttings, offsets, tubers, etc., and have\r\nin consequence been frequently exposed during what may be called their\r\nindividual lives to widely diversified conditions of life. Plants thus\r\npropagated become so variable, that they are subject, as we have seen\r\nin the last chapter, even to bud-variation. Our domesticated animals,\r\non the other hand, are not commonly exposed during the life of the\r\nindividual to such extremely diversified conditions, and are not liable\r\nto such extreme variability; therefore they do not lose the power of\r\ntransmitting most of their characteristic features. In the foregoing\r\nremarks on non-inheritance, crossed breeds are of course excluded, as\r\ntheir diversity mainly depends on the unequal development of character\r\nderived from either parent or their ancestors.\r\n\r\n      _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the early part of this chapter how commonly new\r\ncharacters of the most diversified nature, whether normal or abnormal,\r\ninjurious or beneficial, whether affecting organs of the highest or\r\nmost trifling importance, are inherited. It is often sufficient for the\r\ninheritance of some peculiar character, that one parent alone should\r\npossess it, as in most cases in which the rarer anomalies have been\r\ntransmitted. But the power of transmission is extremely variable. In a\r\nnumber of individuals descended from the same parents, and treated in\r\nthe same manner, some display this power in a perfect manner, and in\r\nsome it is quite deficient; and for this difference no reason can be\r\nassigned. The effects of injuries or mutilations are occasionally\r\ninherited; and we shall see in a future chapter that the long-continued\r\nuse and disuse of parts produces an inherited effect. Even those\r\ncharacters which are considered the most fluctuating, such as colour,\r\nare with rare exceptions transmitted much more forcibly than is\r\ngenerally supposed. The wonder, indeed, in all cases is not that any\r\ncharacter should be transmitted, but that the power of inheritance\r\nshould ever fail. The checks to inheritance, as far as we know them,\r\nare, firstly, circumstances hostile to the particular character in\r\nquestion; secondly, conditions of life incessantly inducing fresh\r\nvariability; and lastly, the crossing of distinct varieties during some\r\nprevious generation, together with reversion or atavism-that is, the\r\ntendency in the child to resemble its grand-parents or more remote\r\nancestors instead of its immediate parents. This latter subject will be\r\ndiscussed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Medical Notes and Reflections,’ 3rd edit., 1855, p. 267.\r\n\r\n [2] Mr. Buckle, in his ‘History of Civilisation,’ expresses doubts on\r\n the subject, owing to the want of statistics. _See also_ Mr. Bowen,\r\n Professor of Moral Philosophy, in ‘Proc.

INHERITANCE _continued_—REVERSION OF ATAVISM.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT FORMS OF REVERSION—IN PURE OR UNCROSSED BREEDS, AS IN\r\nPIGEONS, FOWLS, HORNLESS CATTLE AND SHEEP, IN CULTIVATED\r\nPLANTS—REVERSION IN FERAL ANIMALS AND PLANTS—REVERSION IN CROSSED\r\nVARIETIES AND SPECIES—REVERSION THROUGH BUD-PROPAGATION, AND BY\r\nSEGMENTS IN THE SAME FLOWER OR FRUIT—IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY IN\r\nTHE SAME ANIMAL—THE ACT OF CROSSING A DIRECT CAUSE OF REVERSION,\r\nVARIOUS CASES OF, WITH INSTINCTS—OTHER PROXIMATE CAUSES OF\r\nREVERSION—LATENT CHARACTERS—SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS—UNEQUAL\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE TWO SIDES OF THE BODY—APPEARANCE WITH ADVANCING AGE\r\nOF CHARACTERS DERIVED FROM A CROSS—THE GERM, WITH ALL ITS LATENT\r\nCHARACTERS, A WONDERFUL OBJECT—MONSTROSITIES—PELORIC FLOWERS DUE IN\r\nSOME CASES TO REVERSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great principle of inheritance to be discussed in this chapter has\r\nbeen recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations, as\r\nshown by the scientific term _ Atavism,_ derived from atavus, an\r\nancestor; by the English terms of _Reversion,_ or _Throwing-back_; by\r\nthe French _ Pas-en-Arrière_; and by the German _Rückschlag,_ or\r\n_Rückschritt._ When the child resembles either grandparent more closely\r\nthan its immediate parents, our attention is not much arrested, though\r\nin truth the fact is highly remarkable; but when the child resembles\r\nsome remote ancestor or some distant member in a collateral line,—and\r\nin the last case we must attribute this to the descent of all the\r\nmembers from a common progenitor,—we feel a just degree of\r\nastonishment. When one parent alone displays some newly-acquired and\r\ngenerally inheritable character, and the offspring do not inherit it,\r\nthe cause may lie in the other parent having the power of prepotent\r\ntransmission. But when both parents are similarly characterised, and\r\nthe child does not, whatever the cause may be, inherit the character in\r\nquestion, but resembles its grandparents, we have one of the simplest\r\ncases of reversion. We continually see another and even more simple\r\ncase of atavism, though not generally included under this head, namely,\r\nwhen the son more closely resembles his maternal than his paternal\r\ngrand-sire in some male attribute, as in any peculiarity in the beard\r\nof man, the horns of the bull, the hackles or comb of the cock, or, as\r\nin certain diseases necessarily confined to the male sex; for as the\r\nmother cannot possess or exhibit such male attributes, the child must\r\ninherit them, through her blood, from his maternal grandsire.\r\n\r\n The cases of reversion may be divided into two main classes which,\r\n however, in some instances, blend into one another; namely, first,\r\n those occurring in a variety or race which has not been crossed, but\r\n has lost by variation some character that it formerly possessed, and\r\n which afterwards reappears. The second class includes all cases in\r\n which an individual with some distinguishable character, a race, or\r\n species, has at some former period been crossed, and a character\r\n derived from this cross, after having disappeared during one or\r\n several generations, suddenly reappears. A third class, differing only\r\n in the manner of reproduction, might be formed to include all cases of\r\n reversion effected by means of buds, and therefore independent of true\r\n or seminal generation. Perhaps even a fourth class might be\r\n instituted, to include reversions by segments in the same individual\r\n flower or fruit, and in different parts of the body in the same\r\n individual animal as it grows old. But the two first main classes will\r\n be sufficient for our purpose.\r\n\r\n_Reversion to lost Characters by pure or uncrossed forms._—Striking\r\ninstances of this first class of cases were given in the sixth chapter,\r\nnamely, of the occasional reappearance, in variously-coloured breeds of\r\nthe pigeon, of blue birds with all the marks characteristic of the wild\r\n_Columba livia._ Similar cases were given in the case of the fowl. With\r\nthe common ass, as the legs of the wild progenitor are almost always\r\nstriped, we may feel assured that the occasional appearance of such\r\nstripes in the domestic animal is a case of simple reversion. But I\r\nshall be compelled to refer again to these cases, and therefore here\r\npass them over.\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal species from which our domesticated cattle and sheep are\r\ndescended, no doubt possessed horns; but several hornless breeds are\r\nnow well established. Yet in these—for instance, in Southdown sheep—“it\r\nis not unusual to find among the male lambs some with small horns.” The\r\nhorns, which thus occasionally reappear in other polled breeds, either\r\n“grow to the full size,” or are curiously attached to the skin alone\r\nand hang “loosely down, or drop off.”[1] The Galloways and Suffolk\r\ncattle have been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years, but a horned\r\ncalf, with the horn often loosely attached, is occasionally\r\nproduced.[2]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that sheep in their early domesticated\r\ncondition were “brown or dingy black;” but even in the time of David\r\ncertain flocks were spoken of as white as snow. During the classical\r\nperiod the sheep of Spain are described by several ancient authors as\r\nbeing black, red, or tawny.[3] At the present day, notwithstanding the\r\ngreat care which is taken to prevent it, particoloured lambs and some\r\nentirely black are occasionally, or even frequently, dropped by our\r\nmost highly improved and valued breeds, such as the Southdowns. Since\r\nthe time of the famous Bakewell, during the last century, the Leicester\r\nsheep have been bred with the most scrupulous care; yet occasionally\r\ngrey-faced, or black-spotted, or wholly black lambs appear.[4] This\r\noccurs still more frequently with the less improved breeds, such as the\r\nNorfolks.[5] As bearing on this tendency in sheep to revert to dark\r\ncolours, I may state (though in doing so I trench on the reversion of\r\ncrossed breeds, and likewise on the subject of prepotency) that the\r\nRev. W. D. Fox was informed that seven white Southdown ewes were put to\r\na so-called Spanish ram, which had two small black spots on his sides,\r\nand they produced thirteen lambs, all perfectly black. Mr. Fox believes\r\nthat this ram belonged to a breed which he has himself kept, and which\r\nis always spotted with black and white; and he finds that Leicester\r\nsheep crossed by rams of this breed always produce black lambs: he has\r\ngone on recrossing these crossed sheep with pure white Leicesters\r\nduring three successive generations, but always with the same result.\r\nMr. Fox was also told by the friend from whom the spotted breed was\r\nprocured, that he likewise had gone on for six or seven generations\r\ncrossing with white sheep, but still black lambs were invariably\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nSimilar facts could be given with respect to tailless breeds of various\r\nanimals. For instance, Mr. Hewitt[6] states that chickens bred from\r\nsome rumpless fowls, which were reckoned so good that they won a prize\r\nat an exhibition, “in a considerable number of instances were furnished\r\nwith fully developed tail-feathers.” On inquiry, the original breeder\r\nof these fowls stated that, from the time when he had first kept them,\r\nthey had often produced fowls furnished with tails; but that these\r\nlatter would again reproduce rumpless chickens.\r\n\r\nAnalogous cases of reversion occur in the vegetable kingdom; thus “from\r\nseeds gathered from the finest cultivated varieties of Heartsease\r\n(_Viola tricolor_), plants perfectly wild both in their foliage and\r\ntheir flowers are frequently produced;”[7] but the reversion in this\r\ninstance is not to a very ancient period, for the best existing\r\nvarieties of the heartsease are of comparatively modern origin. With\r\nmost of our cultivated vegetables there is some tendency to reversion\r\nto what is known to be, or may be presumed to be, their aboriginal\r\nstate; and this would be more evident if gardeners did not generally\r\nlook over their beds of seedlings, and pull up the false plants or\r\n“rogues” as they are called. It has already been remarked, that some\r\nfew seedling apples and pears generally resemble, but apparently are\r\nnot identical with, the wild trees from which they are descended. In\r\nour turnip[8] and carrot-beds a few plants often “break ”—that is,\r\nflower too soon; and their roots are generally hard and stringy, as in\r\nthe parent-species. By the aid of a little selection, carried on during\r\na few generations, most of our cultivated plants could probably be\r\nbrought back, without any great change in their conditions of life, to\r\na wild or nearly wild condition: Mr. Buckman has effected this with the\r\nparsnip;[9] and Mr. Hewett C. Watson, as he informs me, selected,\r\nduring three generations, “the most diverging plants of Scotch kail,\r\nperhaps one of the least modified varieties of the cabbage; and in the\r\nthird generation some of the plants came very close to the forms now\r\nestablished in England about old castle-walls, and called indigenous.”\r\n\r\n_Reversion in Animals and Plants which have run wild._—In the cases\r\nhitherto considered, the reverting animals and plants have not been\r\nexposed to any great or abrupt change in their conditions of life which\r\ncould have induced this tendency; but it is very different with animals\r\nand plants which have become feral or run wild. It has been repeatedly\r\nasserted in the most positive manner by various authors, that feral\r\nanimals and plants invariably return to their primitive specific type.\r\nIt is curious on what little evidence this belief rests. Many of our\r\ndomesticated animals could not subsist in a wild state; thus, the more\r\nhighly improved breeds of the pigeon will not “field” or search for\r\ntheir own food. Sheep have never become feral, and would be destroyed\r\nby almost every beast of prey.[10] In several cases we do not know the\r\naboriginal parent-species, and cannot possibly tell whether or not\r\nthere has been any close degree of reversion. It is not known in any\r\ninstance what variety was first turned out; several varieties have\r\nprobably in some cases run wild, and their crossing alone would tend to\r\nobliterate their proper character. Our domesticated animals and plants,\r\nwhen they run wild, must always be exposed to new conditions of life,\r\nfor, as Mr. Wallace[11] has well remarked, they have to obtain their\r\nown food, and are exposed to competition with the native productions.\r\nUnder these circumstances, if our domesticated animals did not undergo\r\nchange of some kind, the result would be quite opposed to the\r\nconclusions arrived at in this work. Nevertheless, I do not doubt that\r\nthe simple fact of animals and plants becoming feral, does cause some\r\ntendency to reversion to the primitive state; though this tendency has\r\nbeen much exaggerated by some authors.\r\n\r\nI will briefly run through the recorded cases. With neither horses nor\r\ncattle is the primitive stock known; and it has been shown in former\r\nchapters that they have assumed different colours in different\r\ncountries. Thus the horses which have run wild in South America are\r\ngenerally brownish-bay, and in the East dun-coloured; their heads have\r\nbecome larger and coarser, and this may be due to reversion. No careful\r\ndescription has been given of the feral goat. Dogs which have run wild\r\nin various countries have hardly anywhere assumed a uniform character;\r\nbut they are probably descended from several domestic races, and\r\naboriginally from several distinct species. Feral cats, both in Europe\r\nand La Plata, are regularly striped; in some cases they have grown to\r\nan unusually large size, but do not differ from the domestic animal in\r\nany other character. When variously-coloured tame rabbits are turned\r\nout in Europe, they generally reacquire the colouring of the wild\r\nanimal; there can be no doubt that this does really occur, but we\r\nshould remember that oddly-coloured and conspicuous animals would\r\nsuffer much from beasts of prey and from being easily shot; this at\r\nleast was the opinion of a gentleman who tried to stock his woods with\r\na nearly white variety; if thus destroyed, they would be supplanted by,\r\ninstead of being transformed into, the common rabbit. We have seen that\r\nthe feral rabbits of Jamaica, and especially of Porto Santo, have\r\nassumed new colours and other new characters. The best known case of\r\nreversion, and that on which the widely spread belief in its\r\nuniversality apparently rests, is that of pigs. These animals have run\r\nwild in the West Indies, South America, and the Falkland Islands, and\r\nhave everywhere acquired the dark colour, the thick bristles, and great\r\ntusks of the wild boar; and the young have reacquired longitudinal\r\nstripes. But even in the case of the pig, Roulin describes the\r\nhalf-wild animals in different parts of South America as differing in\r\nseveral respects. In Louisiana the pig[12] has run wild, and is said to\r\ndiffer a little in form, and much in colour, from the domestic animal,\r\nyet does not closely resemble the wild boar of Europe. With pigeons and\r\nfowls,[13] it is not known what variety was first turned out, nor what\r\ncharacter the feral birds have assumed. The guinea-fowl in the West\r\nIndies, when feral, seems to vary more than in the domesticated state.\r\n\r\nWith respect to plants run wild, Dr. Hooker[14] has strongly insisted\r\non what slight evidence the common belief in their reversion to a\r\nprimitive state rests. Godron[15] describes wild turnips, carrots, and\r\ncelery; but these plants in their cultivated state hardly differ from\r\ntheir wild prototypes, except in the succulency and enlargement of\r\ncertain parts,— characters which would certainly be lost by plants\r\ngrowing in poor soil and struggling with other plants. No cultivated\r\nplant has run wild on so enormous a scale as the cardoon (_Cynara\r\ncardunculus_) in La Plata. Every botanist who has seen it growing\r\nthere, in vast beds, as high as a horse’s back, has been struck with\r\nits peculiar appearance; but whether it differs in any important point\r\nfrom the cultivated Spanish form, which is said not to be prickly like\r\nits American descendant, or whether it differs from the wild\r\nMediterranean species, which is said not to be social (though this may\r\nbe due merely to the nature of the conditions), I do not know.\r\n\r\n_Reversion to Characters derived from a Cross, in the case of\r\nSub-varieties, Races, and Species._—When an individual having some\r\nrecognisable peculiarity unites with another of the same sub-variety,\r\nnot having the peculiarity in question, it often reappears in the\r\ndescendants after an interval of several generations. Every one must\r\nhave noticed, or heard from old people of children closely resembling\r\nin appearance or mental disposition, or in so small and complex a\r\ncharacter as expression, one of their grandparents, or some more\r\ndistant collateral relation. Very many anomalies of structure and\r\ndiseases[16] of which instances have been given in the last chapter,\r\nhave come into a family from one parent, and have reappeared in the\r\nprogeny after passing over two or three generations. The following case\r\nhas been communicated to me on good authority, and may, I believe, be\r\nfully trusted: a pointer-bitch produced seven puppies; four were marked\r\nwith blue and white, which is so unusual a colour with pointers that\r\nshe was thought to have played false with one of the greyhounds, and\r\nthe whole litter was condemned; but the gamekeeper was permitted to\r\nsave one as a curiosity. Two years afterwards a friend of the owner saw\r\nthe young dog, and declared that he was the image of his old\r\npointer-bitch Sappho, the only blue and white pointer of pure descent\r\nwhich he had ever seen. This led to close inquiry, and it was proved\r\nthat he was the great-great-grandson of Sappho; so that, according to\r\nthe common expression, he had only 1/16th of her blood in his veins. I\r\nmay give one other instance, on the authority of Mr. R. Walker, a large\r\ncattle-breeder in Kincardineshire. He bought a black bull, the son of a\r\nblack cow with white legs, white belly and part of the tail white; and\r\nin 1870 a calf the gr.-gr.-gr.-gr.-grandchild of this cow was born\r\ncoloured in the same very peculiar manner; all the intermediate\r\noffspring having been black. In these cases there can hardly be a doubt\r\nthat a character derived from a cross with an individual of the same\r\nvariety reappeared after passing over three generations in the one\r\ncase, and five in the other.\r\n\r\nWhen two distinct races are crossed, it is notorious that the tendency\r\nin the offspring to revert to one or both parent-forms is strong, and\r\nendures for many generations. I have myself seen the clearest evidence\r\nof this in crossed pigeons and with various plants. Mr. Sidney[17]\r\nstates that, in a litter of Essex pigs, two young ones appeared which\r\nwere the image of the Berkshire boar that had been used twenty-eight\r\nyears before in giving size and constitution to the breed. I observed\r\nin the farmyard at Betley Hall some fowls showing a strong likeness to\r\nthe Malay breed, and was told by Mr. Tollet that he had forty years\r\nbefore crossed his birds with Malays; and that, though he had at first\r\nattempted to get rid of this strain, he had subsequently given up the\r\nattempt in despair, as the Malay character would reappear.\r\n\r\nThis strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert has given rise to\r\nendless discussions in how many generations after a single cross,\r\neither with a distinct breed or merely with an inferior animal, the\r\nbreed may be considered as pure, and free from all danger of reversion.\r\nNo one supposes that less than three generations suffices, and most\r\nbreeders think that six, seven, or eight are necessary, and some go to\r\nstill greater lengths.[18] But neither in the case of a breed which has\r\nbeen contaminated by a single cross, nor when, in the attempt to form\r\nan intermediate breed, half-bred animals have been matched together\r\nduring many generations, can any rule be laid down how soon the\r\ntendency to reversion will be obliterated. It depends on the difference\r\nin the strength or prepotency of transmission in the two parent-forms,\r\non their actual amount of difference, and on the nature of the\r\nconditions of life to which the crossed offspring are exposed. But we\r\nmust be careful not to confound these cases of reversion to characters\r\nwhich were gained by a cross, with those under the first class, in\r\nwhich characters originally common to BOTH parents, but lost at some\r\nformer period, reappear; for such characters may recur after an almost\r\nindefinite number of generations.\r\n\r\nThe law of reversion is as powerful with hybrids, when they are\r\nsufficiently fertile to breed together, or when they are repeatedly\r\ncrossed with either pure parent-form, as in the case of mongrels. It is\r\nnot necessary to give instances. With plants almost every one who has\r\nworked on this subject, from the time of Kölreuter to the present day,\r\nhas insisted on this tendency. Gärtner has recorded some good\r\ninstances; but no one has given more striking ones than Naudin.[19] The\r\ntendency differs in degree or strength in different groups, and partly\r\ndepends, as we shall presently see, on whether the parent-plants have\r\nbeen long cultivated. Although the tendency to reversion is extremely\r\ngeneral with nearly all mongrels and hybrids, it cannot be considered\r\nas invariably characteristic of them; it may also be mastered by\r\nlong-continued selection; but these subjects will more properly be\r\ndiscussed in a future chapter on Crossing. From what we see of the\r\npower and scope of reversion, both in pure races, and when varieties or\r\nspecies are crossed, we may infer that characters of almost every kind\r\nare capable of reappearing after having been lost for a great length of\r\ntime. But it does not follow from this that in each particular case\r\ncertain characters will reappear; for instance, this will not occur\r\nwhen a race is crossed with another endowed with prepotency of\r\ntransmission. Sometimes the power of reversion wholly fails, without\r\nour being able to assign any cause for the failure: thus it has been\r\nstated that in a French family in which 85 out of above 600 members,\r\nduring six generations, had been subject to night-blindness, “there has\r\nnot been a single example of this affection in the children of parents\r\nwho were themselves free from it.”[20]\r\n\r\n_Reversion through Bud-propagation—Partial Reversion, by segments in\r\nthe same flower or fruit, or in different parts of the body in the same\r\nindividual animal._—In the eleventh chapter many cases of reversion by\r\nbuds, independently of seminal generation, were given—as when a\r\nleaf-bud on a variegated, a curled, or laciniated variety suddenly\r\nreassumes its proper character; or as when a Provence-rose appears on a\r\nmoss-rose, or a peach on a nectarine-tree. In some of these cases only\r\nhalf the flower or fruit, or a smaller segment, or mere stripes,\r\nreassume their former character; and here we have reversion by\r\nsegments. Vilmorin[21] has also recorded several cases with plants\r\nderived from seed, of flowers reverting by stripes or blotches to their\r\nprimitive colours: he states that in all such cases a white or\r\npale-coloured variety must first be formed, and, when this is\r\npropagated for a length of time by seed, striped seedlings occasionally\r\nmake their appearance; and these can afterwards by care be multiplied\r\nby seed.\r\n\r\nThe stripes and segments just referred to are not due, as far as is\r\nknown, to reversion to characters derived from a cross, but to\r\ncharacters lost by variation. These cases, however, as Naudin[22]\r\ninsists in his discussion on disjunction of character, are closely\r\nanalogous with those given in the eleventh chapter, in which crossed\r\nplants have been known to produce half-and-half or striped flowers and\r\nfruit, or distinct kinds of flowers on the same root resembling the two\r\nparent-forms. Many piebald animals probably come under this same head.\r\nSuch cases, as we shall see in the chapter on Crossing, apparently\r\nresult from certain characters not readily blending together, and, as a\r\nconsequence of this incapacity for fusion, the offspring either\r\nperfectly resemble one of their two parents, or resemble one parent in\r\none part, and the other parent in another part; or whilst young are\r\nintermediate in character, but with advancing age revert wholly or by\r\nsegments to either parent-form, or to both. Thus, young trees of the\r\n_Cytisus_ adami are intermediate in foliage and flowers between the two\r\nparent-forms; but when older the buds continually revert either\r\npartially or wholly to both forms. The cases given in the eleventh\r\nchapter on the changes which occurred during growth in crossed plants\r\nof Tropæolum, Cereus, Datura, and Lathyrus are all analogous. As,\r\nhowever, these plants are hybrids of the first generation, and as their\r\nbuds after a time come to resemble their parents and not their\r\ngrandparents, these cases do not at first appear to come under the law\r\nof reversion in the ordinary sense of the word; nevertheless, as the\r\nchange is effected through a succession of bud-generations on the same\r\nplant, they may be thus included.\r\n\r\nAnalogous facts have been observed in the animal kingdom, and are more\r\nremarkable, as they occur in the same individual in the strictest\r\nsense, and not as with plants through a succession of bud-generations.\r\nWith animals the act of reversion, if it can be so designated, does not\r\npass over a true generation, but merely over the early stages of growth\r\nin the same individual. For instance, I crossed several white hens with\r\na black cock, and many of the chickens were, during the first year,\r\nperfectly white, but acquired during the second year black feathers; on\r\nthe other hand, some of the chickens which were at first black, became\r\nduring the second year piebald with white. A great breeder[23] says,\r\nthat a Pencilled Brahma hen which has any of the blood of the Light\r\nBrahma in her, will “occasionally produce a pullet well pencilled\r\nduring the first year, but she will most likely moult brown on the\r\nshoulders and become quite unlike her original colours in the second\r\nyear.” The same thing occurs with light Brahmas if of impure blood. I\r\nhave observed exactly similar cases with the crossed offspring from\r\ndifferently coloured pigeons. But here is a more remarkable fact: I\r\ncrossed a turbit, which has a frill formed by the feathers being\r\nreversed on its breast, with a trumpeter; and one of the young pigeons\r\nthus raised at first showed not a trace of the frill, but, after\r\nmoulting thrice, a small yet unmistakably distinct frill appeared on\r\nits breast. According to Girou[24] calves produced from a red cow by a\r\nblack bull, or from a black cow by a red bull, are not rarely born red,\r\nand subsequently become black. I possess a dog, the daughter of a white\r\nterrier by a fox-coloured bulldog; as a puppy she was quite white, but\r\nwhen about six months old a black spot appeared on her nose, and brown\r\nspots on her ears. When a little older she was badly wounded on the\r\nback, and the hair which grew on the cicatrix was of a brown colour,\r\napparently derived from her father. This is the more remarkable, as\r\nwith most animals having coloured hair, that which grows on a wounded\r\nsurface is white.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases, the characters which with advancing age\r\nreappeared, were present in the immediately preceding generations; but\r\ncharacters sometimes reappear in the same manner after a much longer\r\ninterval of time. Thus the calves of a hornless race of cattle which\r\noriginated in Corrientes, though at first quite hornless, as they\r\nbecome adult sometimes acquire small, crooked, and loose horns; and\r\nthese in succeeding years occasionally become attached to the\r\nskull.[25] White and black Bantams, both of which generally breed true,\r\nsometimes assume as they grow old a saffron or red plumage. For\r\ninstance, a first-rate black bantam has been described, which during\r\nthree seasons was perfectly black, but then annually became more and\r\nmore red; and it deserves notice that this tendency to change, whenever\r\nit occurs in a bantam, “is almost certain to prove hereditary.”[26] The\r\ncuckoo or blue-mottled Dorking cock, when old, is liable to acquire\r\nyellow or orange hackles in place of his proper bluish-grey\r\nhackles.[27] Now as _Gallus bankiva_ is coloured red and orange, and as\r\nDorking fowls and bantams are descended from this species, we can\r\nhardly doubt that the change which occasionally occurs in the plumage\r\nof these birds as their age advances, results from a tendency in the\r\nindividual to revert to the primitive type.\r\n\r\n_Crossing as a direct cause of Reversion._—It has long been notorious\r\nthat hybrids and mongrels often revert to both or to one of their\r\nparent-forms, after an interval of from two to seven or eight, or,\r\naccording to some authorities, even a greater number of generations.\r\nBut that the act of crossing in itself gives an impulse towards\r\nreversion, as shown by the reappearance of long-lost characters, has\r\nnever, I believe, been hitherto proved. The proof lies in certain\r\npeculiarities, which do not characterise the immediate parents, and\r\ntherefore cannot have been derived from them, frequently appearing in\r\nthe offspring of two breeds when crossed, which peculiarities never\r\nappear, or appear with extreme rarity, in these same breeds, as long as\r\nthey are precluded from crossing. As this conclusion seems to me highly\r\ncurious and novel, I will give the evidence in detail.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first called to this subject, and I was led to make\r\nnumerous experiments, by MM. Boitard and Corbie having stated that,\r\nwhen they crossed certain breeds of pigeons, birds coloured like the\r\nwild _C. livia,_ or the common dovecote—namely, slaty-blue, with double\r\nblack wing-bars, sometimes chequered with black, white loins, the tail\r\nbarred with black, with the outer feathers edged with white,—were\r\nalmost invariably produced. The breeds which I crossed, and the\r\nremarkable results attained, have been fully described in the sixth\r\nchapter. I selected pigeons belonging to true and ancient breeds, which\r\nhad not a trace of blue or any of the above specified marks; but when\r\ncrossed, and their mongrels recrossed, young birds were often produced,\r\nmore or less plainly coloured slaty-blue, with some or all of the\r\nproper characteristic marks. I may recall to the reader’s memory one\r\ncase, namely, that of a pigeon, hardly distinguishable from the wild\r\nShetland species, the grandchild of a red-spot, white fantail, and two\r\nblack barbs, from any of which, when purely-bred, the production of a\r\npigeon coloured like the wild _C. livia_ would have been almost a\r\nprodigy.\r\n\r\nI was thus led to make the experiments, recorded in the seventh\r\nchapter, on fowls. I selected long-established pure breeds, in which\r\nthere was not a trace of red, yet in several of the mongrels feathers\r\nof this colour appeared; and one magnificent bird, the offspring of a\r\nblack Spanish cock and white Silk hen, was coloured almost exactly like\r\nthe wild _Gallus bankiva._ All who know anything of the breeding of\r\npoultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure Spanish and of pure\r\nwhite Silk fowls might have been reared without the appearance of a red\r\nfeather. The fact, given on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, of the\r\nfrequent appearance, in mongrel fowls, of pencilled or\r\ntransversely-barred feathers, like those common to many gallinaceous\r\nbirds, is likewise apparently a case of reversion to a character\r\nformerly possessed by some ancient progenitor of the family. I owe to\r\nthe kindness of this excellent observer the opportunity of inspecting\r\nsome neck-hackles and tail-feathers from a hybrid between the common\r\nfowl and a very distinct species, the Gallus varius; and these feathers\r\nare transversely striped in a conspicuous manner with dark metallic\r\nblue and grey, a character which could not have been derived from\r\neither immediate parent.\r\n\r\nI have been informed by Mr. B. P. Brent, that he crossed a white\r\nAylesbury drake and a black so-called Labrador duck, both of which are\r\ntrue breeds, and he obtained a young drake closely like the mallard\r\n(_A. boschas_). Of the musk-duck (_Cairina moschata,_ Linn.) there are\r\ntwo sub-breeds, namely, white and slate-coloured; and these I am\r\ninformed breed true, or nearly true. But the Rev. W. D. Fox tells me\r\nthat, by putting a white drake to a slate-coloured duck, black birds,\r\npied with white, like the wild musk-duck, were always produced. I hear\r\nfrom Mr. Blyth that hybrids from the canary and gold-finch almost\r\nalways have streaked feathers on their backs; and this streaking must\r\nbe derived from the original wild canary.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the fourth chapter, that the so-called Himalayan\r\nrabbit, with its snow-white body, black ears, nose, tail, and feet,\r\nbreeds perfectly true. This race is known to have been formed by the\r\nunion of two varieties of silver-grey rabbits. Now, when a Himalayan\r\ndoe was crossed by a sandy-coloured buck, a silver-grey rabbit was\r\nproduced; and this is evidently a case of reversion to one of the\r\nparent varieties. The young of the Himalayan rabbit are born\r\nsnow-white, and the dark marks do not appear until some time\r\nsubsequently; but occasionally young Himalayan rabbits are born of a\r\nlight silver-grey, which colour soon disappears; so that here we have a\r\ntrace of reversion, during an early period of life, to the parent\r\nvarieties, independently of any recent cross.\r\n\r\nIn the third chapter it was shown that at an ancient period some breeds\r\nof cattle in the wilder parts of Britain were white with dark ears, and\r\nthat the cattle now kept half wild in certain parks, and those which\r\nhave run quite wild in two distant parts of the world, are likewise\r\nthus coloured. Now, an experienced breeder, Mr. J. Beasley, of\r\nNorthamptonshire,[28] crossed some carefully selected West Highland\r\ncows with purely-bred shorthorn bulls. The bulls were red, red and\r\nwhite, or dark roan; and the Highland cows were all of a red colour,\r\ninclining to a light or yellow shade. But a considerable number of the\r\noffspring—and Mr. Beasley calls attention to this as a remarkable\r\nfact—were white, or white with red ears. Bearing in mind that none of\r\nthe parents were white, and that they were purely-bred animals, it is\r\nhighly probable that here the offspring reverted, in consequence of the\r\ncross, to the colour of some ancient and half-wild parent-breed. The\r\nfollowing case, perhaps, comes under the same head: cows in their\r\nnatural state have their udders but little developed, and do not yield\r\nnearly so much milk as our domesticated animals. Now there is some\r\nreason to believe[29] that cross-bred animals between two kinds, both\r\nof which are good milkers, such as Alderneys and Shorthorns, often turn\r\nout worthless in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the Horse reasons were assigned for believing that\r\nthe primitive stock was striped and dun-coloured; and details were\r\ngiven, showing that in all parts of the world stripes of a dark colour\r\nfrequently appear along the spine, across the legs, and on the\r\nshoulders, where they are occasionally double or treble, and even\r\nsometimes on the face and body of horses of all breeds and of all\r\ncolours. But the stripes appear most frequently on the various kinds of\r\nduns. In foals they are sometimes plainly seen, and subsequently\r\ndisappear. The dun-colour and the stripes are strongly transmitted when\r\na horse thus characterised is crossed with any other; but I was not\r\nable to prove that striped duns are generally produced from the\r\ncrossing of two distinct breeds, neither of which are duns, though this\r\ndoes sometimes occur.\r\n\r\nThe legs of the ass are often striped, and this may be considered as a\r\nreversion to the wild parent form, the _Equus tæniopus_ of\r\nAbyssinia,[30] which is generally thus striped. In the domestic animal\r\nthe stripes on the shoulder are occasionally double, or forked at the\r\nextremity, as in certain zebrine species. There is reason to believe\r\nthat the foal is more frequently striped on the legs than the adult\r\nanimal. As with the horse, I have not acquired any distinct evidence\r\nthat the crossing of differently-coloured varieties of the ass brings\r\nout the stripes.\r\n\r\nBut now let us turn to the result of crossing the horse and ass.\r\nAlthough mules are not nearly so numerous in England as asses, I have\r\nseen a much greater number with striped legs, and with the stripes far\r\nmore conspicuous than in either parent-form. Such mules are generally\r\nlight-coloured, and might be called fallow-duns. The shoulder-stripe in\r\none instance was deeply forked at the extremity, and in another\r\ninstance was double, though united in the middle. Mr. Martin gives a\r\nfigure of a Spanish mule with strong zebra-like marks on its legs,[31]\r\nand remarks that mules are particularly liable to be thus striped on\r\ntheir legs. In South America, according to Roulin,[32] such stripes are\r\nmore frequent and conspicuous in the mule than in the ass. In the\r\nUnited States, Mr. Gosse,[33] speaking of these animals, says, “that in\r\na great number, perhaps in nine out of every ten, the legs are banded\r\nwith transverse dark stripes.”\r\n\r\nMany years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple hybrid,\r\nfrom a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra. This\r\nanimal when old had hardly any stripes; but I was assured by the\r\nsuperintendent, that when young it had shoulder-stripes, and faint\r\nstripes on its flanks and legs. I mention this case more especially as\r\nan instance of the stripes being much plainer during youth than in old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAs the zebra has such a conspicuously striped body and legs, it might\r\nhave been expected that the hybrids from this animal and the common ass\r\nwould have had their legs in some degree striped; but it appears from\r\nthe figures given in Dr. Gray’s ‘Knowsley Gleanings’ and still more\r\nplainly from that given by Geoffroy and F. Cuvier,[34] that the legs\r\nare much more conspicuously striped than the rest of the body; and this\r\nfact is intelligible only on the belief that the ass aids in giving,\r\nthrough the power of reversion, this character to its hybrid offspring.\r\n\r\nThe quagga is banded over the whole front part of its body like a\r\nzebra, but has no stripes on its legs, or mere traces of them. But in\r\nthe famous hybrid bred by Lord Morton[35] from a chestnut, nearly\r\npurely-bred, Arabian mare, by a male quagga, the stripes were more\r\nstrongly defined and darker than those on the legs of “the quagga.” The\r\nmare was subsequently put to a black Arabian horse, and bore two colts,\r\nboth of which, as formerly stated, were plainly striped on the legs,\r\nand one of them likewise had stripes on the neck and body.\r\n\r\nThe _Equus indicus_[36] is characterised by a spinal stripe, without\r\nshoulder or leg stripes; but traces of these latter stripes may\r\noccasionally be seen even in the adult[37] and Colonel S. Poole, who\r\nhas had ample opportunities for observation, informs me that in the\r\nfoal, when first born, the head and legs are often striped, but the\r\nshoulder-stripe is not so distinct as in the domestic ass; all these\r\nstripes, excepting that along the spine, soon disappear. Now a hybrid,\r\nraised at Knowsley[38] from a female of this species by a male domestic\r\nass, had all four legs transversely and conspicuously striped, had\r\nthree short stripes on each shoulder and had even some zebra-like\r\nstripes on its face! Dr. Gray informs me that he has seen a second\r\nhybrid of the same parentage, similarly striped.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts we see that the crossing of the several equine species\r\ntends in a marked manner to cause stripes to appear on various parts of\r\nthe body, especially on the legs. As we do not know whether the\r\nparent-form of the genus was striped, the appearance of the stripes can\r\nonly hypothetically be attributed to reversion. But most persons, after\r\nconsidering the many undoubted cases of variously coloured marks\r\nreappearing by reversion in my experiments on crossed pigeons and\r\nfowls, will come to the same conclusion with respect to the\r\nhorse-genus; and if so, we must admit that the progenitor of the group\r\nwas striped on the legs, shoulders, face, and probably over the whole\r\nbody, like a zebra.\r\n\r\nLastly, Professor Jaeger has given[39] a good case with pigs. He\r\ncrossed the Japanese or masked breed with the common German breed, and\r\nthe offspring were intermediate in character. He then re-crossed one of\r\nthese mongrels with the pure Japanese, and in the litter thus produced\r\none of the young resembled in all its characters a wild pig; it had a\r\nlong snout and upright ears, and was striped on the back. It should be\r\nborne in mind that the young of the Japanese breed are not striped, and\r\nthat they have a short muzzle and ears remarkably dependent.\r\n\r\nA similar tendency to the recovery of long lost characters holds good\r\neven with the instincts of crossed animals. There are some breeds of\r\nfowls which are called “everlasting layers,” because they have lost the\r\ninstinct of incubation; and so rare is it for them to incubate that I\r\nhave seen notices published in works on poultry, when hens of such\r\nbreeds have taken to sit.[40] Yet the aboriginal species was of course\r\na good incubator; and with birds in a state of nature hardly any\r\ninstinct is so strong as this. Now, so many cases have been recorded of\r\nthe crossed offspring from two races, neither of which are incubators,\r\nbecoming first-rate sitters, that the reappearance of this instinct\r\nmust be attributed to reversion from crossing. One author goes so far\r\nas to say, “that a cross between two non-sitting varieties almost\r\ninvariably produces a mongrel that becomes broody, and sits with\r\nremarkable steadiness.”[41] Another author, after giving a striking\r\nexample, remarks that the fact can be explained only on the principle\r\nthat “two negatives make a positive.” It cannot, however, be maintained\r\nthat hens produced from a cross between two non-sitting breeds\r\ninvariably recover their lost instinct, any more than that crossed\r\nfowls or pigeons invariably recover the red or blue plumage of their\r\nprototypes. Thus I raised several chickens from a Polish hen by a\r\nSpanish cock,—breeds which do not incubate,—and none of the young hens\r\nat first showed any tendency to sit; but one of them—the only one which\r\nwas preserved—in the third year sat well on her eggs and reared a brood\r\nof chickens. So that here we have the reappearance with advancing age\r\nof a primitive instinct, in the same manner as we have seen that the\r\nred plumage of the _Gallus bankiva_ is sometimes reacquired both by\r\ncrossed and purely-bred fowls of various kinds as they grow old.\r\n\r\nThe parents of all our domesticated animals were of course aboriginally\r\nwild in disposition; and when a domesticated species is crossed with a\r\ndistinct species, whether this is a domesticated or only a tamed\r\nanimal, the hybrids are often wild to such a degree, that the fact is\r\nintelligible only on the principle that the cross has caused a partial\r\nreturn to a primitive disposition. Thus, the Earl of Powis formerly\r\nimported some thoroughly domesticated humped cattle from India, and\r\ncrossed them with English breeds, which belong to a distinct species;\r\nand his agent remarked to me, without any question having been asked,\r\nhow oddly wild the cross-bred animals were. The European wild boar and\r\nthe Chinese domesticated pig are almost certainly specifically\r\ndistinct: Sir F. Darwin crossed a sow of the latter breed with a wild\r\nAlpine boar which had become extremely tame, but the young, though\r\nhaving half-domesticated blood in their veins, were “extremely wild in\r\nconfinement, and would not eat swill like common English pigs.” Captain\r\nHutton, in India, crossed a tame goat with a wild one from the\r\nHimalaya, and he remarked to me how surprisingly wild the offspring\r\nwere. Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in crossing tame\r\ncock-pheasants with fowls belonging to five breeds, gives as the\r\ncharacter of all “extraordinary wildness”;[42] but I have myself seen\r\none exception to this rule. Mr. S. J. Salter[43] who raised a large\r\nnumber of hybrids from a bantam-hen by _Gallus sonneratii,_ states that\r\n“all were exceedingly wild.” Mr. Waterton[44] bred some wild ducks from\r\neggs hatched under a common duck, and the young were allowed to cross\r\nfreely both amongst themselves and with the tame ducks; they were “half\r\nwild and half tame; they came to the windows to be fed, but still they\r\nhad a wariness about them quite remarkable.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, mules from the horse and ass are certainly not in\r\nthe least wild, though notorious for obstinacy and vice. Mr. Brent, who\r\nhas crossed canary-birds with many kinds of finches, has not observed,\r\nas he informs me, that the hybrids were in any way remarkably wild: but\r\nMr. Jenner Weir who has had still greater experience, is of a directly\r\nopposite opinion. He remarks that the siskin is the tamest of finches,\r\nbut its mules are as wild, when young, as newly caught birds, and are\r\noften lost through their continued efforts to escape. Hybrids are often\r\nraised between the common and musk duck, and I have been assured by\r\nthree persons, who have kept these crossed birds, that they were not\r\nwild; but Mr. Garnett[45] observed that his hybrids were wild, and\r\nexhibited “migratory propensities” of which there is not a vestige in\r\nthe common or musk duck. No case is known of this latter bird having\r\nescaped and become wild in Europe or Asia, except, according to Pallas,\r\non the Caspian Sea; and the common domestic duck only occasionally\r\nbecomes wild in districts where large lakes and fens abound.\r\nNevertheless, a large number of cases have been recorded[46] of hybrids\r\nfrom these two ducks having been shot in a completely wild state,\r\nalthough so few are reared in comparison with purely-bred birds of\r\neither species. It is improbable that any of these hybrids could have\r\nacquired their wildness from the musk-duck having paired with a truly\r\nwild duck; and this is known not to be the case in North America; hence\r\nwe must infer that they have reacquired, through reversion, their\r\nwildness, as well as renewed powers of flight.\r\n\r\nThese latter facts remind us of the statements, so frequently made by\r\ntravellers in all parts of the world, on the degraded state and savage\r\ndisposition of crossed races of man. That many excellent and\r\nkind-hearted mulattos have existed no one will dispute; and a more mild\r\nand gentle set of men could hardly be found than the inhabitants of the\r\nisland of Chiloe, who consist of Indians commingled with Spaniards in\r\nvarious proportions. On the other hand, many years ago, long before I\r\nhad thought of the present subject, I was struck with the fact that, in\r\nSouth America, men of complicated descent between Negroes, Indians, and\r\nSpaniards, seldom had, whatever the cause might be, a good\r\nexpression.[47] Livingstone—and a more unimpeachable authority cannot\r\nbe quoted,—after speaking of a half-caste man on the Zambesi, described\r\nby the Portuguese as a rare monster of inhumanity, remarks, “It is\r\nunaccountable why half-castes, such as he, are so much more cruel than\r\nthe Portuguese, but such is undoubtedly the case.” An inhabitant\r\nremarked to Livingstone, “God made white men, and God made black men,\r\nbut the Devil made halfcastes.”[48] When two races, both low in the\r\nscale, are crossed the progeny seems to be eminently bad. Thus the\r\nnoble-hearted Humboldt, who felt no prejudice against the inferior\r\nraces, speaks in strong terms of the bad and savage disposition of\r\nZambos, or half-castes between Indians and Negroes; and this conclusion\r\nhas been arrived at by various observers.[49] From these facts we may\r\nperhaps infer that the degraded state of so many half-castes is in part\r\ndue to reversion to a primitive and savage condition, induced by the\r\nact of crossing, even if mainly due to the unfavourable moral\r\nconditions under which they are generally reared.\r\n\r\n_Summary on the proximate causes leading to Reversion._—When\r\npurely-bred animals or plants reassume long-lost characters,—when the\r\ncommon ass, for instance, is born with striped legs, when a pure race\r\nof black or white pigeons throws a slaty-blue bird, or when a\r\ncultivated heartsease with large and rounded flowers produces a\r\nseedling with small and elongated flowers,—we are quite unable to\r\nassign any proximate cause. When animals run wild, the tendency to\r\nreversion, which, though it has been greatly exaggerated, no doubt\r\nexists, is sometimes to a certain extent intelligible. Thus, with feral\r\npigs, exposure to the weather will probably favour the growth of the\r\nbristles, as is known to be the case with the hair of other\r\ndomesticated animals, and through correlation the tusks will tend to be\r\nredeveloped. But the reappearance of coloured longitudinal stripes on\r\nyoung feral pigs cannot be attributed to the direct action of external\r\nconditions. In this case, and in many others, we can only say that any\r\nchange in the habits of life apparently favour a tendency, inherent or\r\nlatent in the species, to return to the primitive state.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown in a future chapter that the position of flowers on\r\nthe summit of the axis, and the position of seeds within the capsule,\r\nsometimes determine a tendency towards reversion; and this apparently\r\ndepends on the amount of sap or nutriment which the flower-buds and\r\nseeds receive. The position, also, of buds, either on branches or on\r\nroots, sometimes determines, as was formerly shown, the transmission of\r\nthe character proper to the variety, or its reversion to a former\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last section that when two races or species are\r\ncrossed there is the strongest tendency to the reappearance in the\r\noffspring of long-lost characters, possessed by neither parent nor\r\nimmediate progenitor. When two white, or red, or black pigeons, of\r\nwell-established breeds, are united, the offspring are almost sure to\r\ninherit the same colours; but when differently-coloured birds are\r\ncrossed, the opposed forces of inheritance apparently counteract each\r\nother, and the tendency which is inherent in both parents to produce\r\nslaty-blue offspring becomes predominant. So it is in several other\r\ncases. But when, for instance, the ass is crossed with _E. indicus_ or\r\nwith the horse—animals which have not striped legs—and the hybrids have\r\nconspicuous stripes on their legs and even on their faces, all that can\r\nbe said is, that an inherent tendency to reversion is evolved through\r\nsome disturbance in the organisation caused by the act of crossing.\r\n\r\nAnother form of reversion is far commoner, indeed is almost universal\r\nwith the offspring from a cross, namely, to the characters proper to\r\neither pure parent-form. As a general rule, crossed offspring in the\r\nfirst generation are nearly intermediate between their parents, but the\r\ngrandchildren and succeeding generations continually revert, in a\r\ngreater or lesser degree, to one or both of their progenitors. Several\r\nauthors have maintained that hybrids and mongrels include all the\r\ncharacters of both parents, not fused together, but merely mingled in\r\ndifferent proportions in different parts of the body; or, as Naudin[50]\r\nhas expressed it, a hybrid is a living mosaic-work, in which the eye\r\ncannot distinguish the discordant elements, so completely are they\r\nintermingled. We can hardly doubt that, in a certain sense, this is\r\ntrue, as when we behold in a hybrid the elements of both species\r\nsegregating themselves into segments in the same flower or fruit, by a\r\nprocess of self-attraction or self-affinity; this segregation taking\r\nplace either by seminal or bud-propagation. Naudin further believes\r\nthat the segregation of the two specific elements or essences is\r\neminently liable to occur in the male and female reproductive matter;\r\nand he thus explains the almost universal tendency to reversion in\r\nsuccessive hybrid generations. For this would be the natural result of\r\nthe union of pollen and ovules, in both of which the elements of the\r\nsame species had been segregated by self-affinity. If, on the other\r\nhand, pollen which included the elements of one species happened to\r\nunite with ovules including the elements of the other species, the\r\nintermediate or hybrid state would still be retained, and there would\r\nbe no reversion. But it would, as I suspect, be more correct to say\r\nthat the elements of both parent-species exist in every hybrid in a\r\ndouble state, namely, blended together and completely separate. How\r\nthis is possible, and what the term specific essence or element may be\r\nsupposed to express, I shall attempt to show in the chapter on the\r\nhypothesis of pangenesis.\r\n\r\nBut Naudin’s view, as propounded by him, is not applicable to the\r\nreappearance of characters lost long ago by variation; and it is hardly\r\napplicable to races or species which, after having been crossed at some\r\nformer period with a distinct form, and having since lost all traces of\r\nthe cross, nevertheless occasionally yield an individual which reverts\r\n(as in the case of the great-great-grandchild of the pointer Sappho) to\r\nthe crossing form. The most simple case of reversion, namely, of a\r\nhybrid or mongrel to its grandparents, is connected by an almost\r\nperfect series with the extreme case of a purely-bred race recovering\r\ncharacters which had been lost during many ages; and we are thus led to\r\ninfer that all the cases must be related by some common bond.\r\n\r\nGärtner believed that only highly sterile hybrid plants exhibit any\r\ntendency to reversion to their parent-forms. This erroneous belief may\r\nperhaps be accounted for by the nature of the genera crossed by him,\r\nfor he admits that the tendency differs in different genera. The\r\nstatement is also directly contradicted by Naudin’s observations, and\r\nby the notorious fact that perfectly fertile mongrels exhibit the\r\ntendency in a high degree,—even in a higher degree, according to\r\nGärtner himself, than hybrids.[51]\r\n\r\nGärtner further states that reversions rarely occur with hybrid plants\r\nraised from species which have not been cultivated, whilst, with those\r\nwhich have been long cultivated, they are of frequent occurrence. This\r\nconclusion explains a curious discrepancy: Max Wichura[52] who worked\r\nexclusively on willows which had not been subjected to culture, never\r\nsaw an instance of reversion; and he goes so far as to suspect that the\r\ncareful Gartner had not sufficiently protected his hybrids from the\r\npollen of the parent-species: Naudin, on the other hand, who chiefly\r\nexperimented on cucurbitaceous and other cultivated plants, insists\r\nmore strenuously than any other author on the tendency to reversion in\r\nall hybrids. The conclusion that the condition of the parent-species,\r\nas affected by culture, is one of the proximate causes leading to\r\nreversion, agrees well with the converse case of domesticated animals\r\nand cultivated plants being liable to reversion when they become feral;\r\nfor in both cases the organisation or constitution must be disturbed,\r\nthough in a very different way.[53]\r\n\r\nFinally, we have seen that characters often reappear in purely-bred\r\nraces without our being able to assign any proximate cause; but when\r\nthey become feral this is either indirectly or directly induced by the\r\nchange in their conditions of life. With crossed breeds, the act of\r\ncrossing in itself certainly leads to the recovery of long-lost\r\ncharacters, as well as of those derived from either parent-form.\r\nChanged conditions, consequent on cultivation, and the relative\r\nposition of buds, flowers, and seeds on the plant, all apparently aid\r\nin giving this same tendency. Reversion may occur either through\r\nseminal or bud generation, generally at birth, but sometimes only with\r\nan advance of age. Segments or portions of the individual may alone be\r\nthus affected. That a being should be born resembling in certain\r\ncharacters an ancestor removed by two or three, and in some cases by\r\nhundreds or even thousands of generations, is assuredly a wonderful\r\nfact. In these cases the child is commonly said to inherit such\r\ncharacters directly from its grandparent, or more remote ancestors. But\r\nthis view is hardly conceivable. If, however, we suppose that every\r\ncharacter is derived exclusively from the father or mother, but that\r\nmany characters lie latent or dormant in both parents during a long\r\nsuccession of generations, the foregoing facts are intelligible. In\r\nwhat manner characters may be conceived to lie latent, will be\r\nconsidered in a future chapter to which I have lately alluded.\r\n\r\n_Latent Characters._—But I must explain what is meant by characters\r\nlying latent. The most obvious illustration is afforded by secondary\r\nsexual characters. In every female all the secondary male characters,\r\nand in every male all the secondary female characters, apparently exist\r\nin a latent state, ready to be evolved under certain conditions. It is\r\nwell known that a large number of female birds, such as fowls, various\r\npheasants, partridges, peahens, ducks, etc., when old or diseased, or\r\nwhen operated on, assume many or all of the secondary male characters\r\nof their species. In the case of the hen-pheasant this has been\r\nobserved to occur far more frequently during certain years than during\r\nothers.[54] A duck ten years old has been known to assume both the\r\nperfect winter and summer plumage of the drake.[55] Waterton,[56] gives\r\na curious case of a hen which had ceased laying, and had assumed the\r\nplumage, voice, spurs, and warlike disposition of the cock; when\r\nopposed to an enemy she would erect her hackles and show fight. Thus\r\nevery character, even to the instinct and manner of fighting, must have\r\nlain dormant in this hen as long as her ovaria continued to act. The\r\nfemales of two kinds of deer, when old, have been known to acquire\r\nhorns; and, as Hunter has remarked, we see something of an analogous\r\nnature in the human species.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with male animals, it is notorious that the\r\nsecondary sexual characters are more or less completely lost when they\r\nare subjected to castration. Thus, if the operation be performed on a\r\nyoung cock, he never, as Yarrell states, crows again; the comb,\r\nwattles, and spurs do not grow to their full size, and the hackles\r\nassume an intermediate appearance between true hackles and the feathers\r\nof the hen. Cases are recorded of confinement, which often affects the\r\nreproductive system, causing analogous results. But characters properly\r\nconfined to the female are likewise acquired by the male; the capon\r\ntakes to sitting on eggs, and will bring up chickens; and what is more\r\ncurious, the utterly sterile male hybrids from the pheasant and the\r\nfowl act in the same manner, “their delight being to watch when the\r\nhens leave their nests, and to take on themselves the office of a\r\nsitter.”[57] That admirable observer Reaumur[58] asserts that a cock,\r\nby being long confined in solitude and darkness, can be taught to take\r\ncharge of young chickens; he then utters a peculiar cry, and retains\r\nduring his whole life this newly acquired maternal instinct. The many\r\nwell-ascertained cases of various male mammals giving milk shows that\r\ntheir rudimentary mammary glands retain this capacity in a latent\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that in many, probably in all cases, the secondary\r\ncharacters of each sex lie dormant or latent in the opposite sex, ready\r\nto be evolved under peculiar circumstances. We can thus understand how,\r\nfor instance, it is possible for a good milking cow to transmit her\r\ngood qualities through her male offspring to future generations; for we\r\nmay confidently believe that these qualities are present, though\r\nlatent, in the males of each generation. So it is with the game-cock,\r\nwho can transmit his superiority in courage and vigour through his\r\nfemale to his male offspring; and with man it is known[59] that\r\ndiseases, such as hydrocele, necessarily confined to the male sex, can\r\nbe transmitted through the female to the grandson. Such cases as these\r\noffer, as was remarked at the commencement of this chapter, the\r\nsimplest possible examples of reversion; and they are intelligible on\r\nthe belief that characters common to the grandparent and grandchild of\r\nthe same sex are present, though latent, in the intermediate parent of\r\nthe opposite sex.\r\n\r\nThe subject of latent characters is so important, as we shall see in a\r\nfuture chapter, that I will give another illustration. Many animals\r\nhave the right and left sides of their body unequally developed: this\r\nis well known to be the case with flat-fish, in which the one side\r\ndiffers in thickness and colour and in the shape of the fins, from the\r\nother, and during the growth of the young fish one eye is gradually\r\ntwisted from the lower to the upper surface.[60] In most flat-fishes\r\nthe left is the blind side, but in some it is the right; though in both\r\ncases reversed or “wrong fishes,” are occasionally developed; and in\r\n_Platessa flesus_ the right or left side is indifferently the upper\r\none. With gasteropods or shell-fish, the right and left sides are\r\nextremely unlike; the far greater number of species are dextral, with\r\nrare and occasional reversals of development; and some few are normally\r\nsinistral; but certain species of Bulimus, and many Achatinellæ[61] are\r\nas often sinistral as dextral. I will give an analogous case in the\r\ngreat articulate kingdom: the two sides of Verruca[62] are so\r\nwonderfully unlike, that without careful dissection it is extremely\r\ndifficult to recognise the corresponding parts on the opposite sides of\r\nthe body; yet it is apparently a mere matter of chance whether it be\r\nthe right or the left side that undergoes so singular amount of change.\r\nOne plant is known to me[63] in which the flower, according as it\r\nstands on the one or other side of the spike, is unequally developed.\r\nIn all the foregoing cases the two sides are perfectly symmetrical at\r\nan early period of growth. Now, whenever a species is as liable to be\r\nunequally developed on the one as on the other side, we may infer that\r\nthe capacity for such development is present, though latent, in the\r\nundeveloped side. And as a reversal of development occasionally occurs\r\nin animals of many kinds, this latent capacity is probably very common.\r\n\r\nThe best yet simplest cases of characters lying dormant are, perhaps,\r\nthose previously given, in which chickens and young pigeons, raised\r\nfrom a cross between differently coloured birds, are at first of one\r\ncolour, but in a year or two acquire feathers of the colour of the\r\nother parent; for in this case the tendency to a change of plumage is\r\nclearly latent in the young bird. So it is with hornless breeds of\r\ncattle, some of which acquire small horns as they grow old. Purely bred\r\nblack and white bantams, and some other fowls, occasionally assume,\r\nwith advancing years, the red feathers of the parent-species. I will\r\nhere add a somewhat different case, as it connects in a striking manner\r\nlatent characters of two classes. Mr. Hewitt[64] possessed an excellent\r\nSebright gold-laced bantam hen, which, as she became old, grew diseased\r\nin her ovaria, and assumed male characters. In this breed the males\r\nresemble the females in all respects except in their combs, wattles,\r\nspurs, and instincts; hence it might have been expected that the\r\ndiseased hen would have assumed only those masculine characters which\r\nare proper to the breed, but she acquired, in addition, well-arched\r\ntail sickle-feathers quite a foot in length, saddle-feathers on the\r\nloins, and hackles on the neck,—ornaments which, as Mr. Hewitt remarks,\r\n“would be held as abominable in this breed.” The Sebright bantam is\r\nknown[65] to have originated about the year 1800 from a cross between a\r\ncommon bantam and a Polish fowl, recrossed by a hen-tailed bantam, and\r\ncarefully selected; hence there can hardly be a doubt that the\r\nsickle-feathers and hackles which appeared in the old hen were derived\r\nfrom the Polish fowl or common bantam; and we thus see that not only\r\ncertain masculine characters proper to the Sebright bantam, but other\r\nmasculine characters derived from the first progenitors of the breed,\r\nremoved by a period of above sixty years, were lying latent in this\r\nhenbird, ready to be evolved as soon as her ovaria became diseased.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts it must be admitted that certain characters,\r\ncapacities, and instincts, may lie latent in an individual, and even in\r\na succession of individuals, without our being able to detect the least\r\nsign of their presence. When fowls, pigeons, or cattle of different\r\ncolours are crossed, and their offspring change colour as they grow\r\nold, or when the crossed turbit acquired the characteristic frill after\r\nits third moult, or when rarely-bred bantams partially assume the red\r\nplumage of their prototype, we cannot doubt that these qualities were\r\nfrom the first present, though latent, in the individual animal, like\r\nthe characters of a moth in the caterpillar. Now, if these animals had\r\nproduced offspring before they had acquired with advancing age their\r\nnew characters, nothing is more probable than that they would have\r\ntransmitted them to some of their offspring, who in this case would in\r\nappearance have received such characters from their grand-parents or\r\nmore distant progenitors. We should then have had a case of reversion,\r\nthat is, of the reappearance in the child of an ancestral character,\r\nactually present, though during youth completely latent, in the parent;\r\nand this we may safely conclude is what occurs in all reversions to\r\nprogenitors, however remote.\r\n\r\nThis view of the latency in each generation of all the characters which\r\nappear through reversion, is also supported by their actual presence in\r\nsome cases during early youth alone, or by their more frequent\r\nappearance and greater distinctness at this age than during maturity.\r\nWe have seen that this is often the case with the stripes on the legs\r\nand faces of the several species of the horse genus. The Himalayan\r\nrabbit, when crossed, sometimes produces offspring which revert to the\r\nparent silver-grey breed, and we have seen that in purely bred animals\r\npale-grey fur occasionally reappears during early youth. Black cats, we\r\nmay feel assured, would occasionally produce by reversion tabbies; and\r\non young black kittens, with a pedigree[66] known to have been long\r\npure, faint traces of stripes may almost always be seen which\r\nafterwards disappear. Hornless Suffolk cattle occasionally produce by\r\nreversion horned animals; and Youatt[67] asserts that even in hornless\r\nindividuals “the rudiment of a horn may be often felt at an early age.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt it appears at first sight in the highest degree improbable\r\nthat in every horse of every generation there should be a latent\r\ncapacity and tendency to produce stripes, though these may not appear\r\nonce in a thousand generations; that in every white, black, or other\r\ncoloured pigeon, which may have transmitted its proper colour during\r\ncenturies, there should be a latent capacity in the plumage to become\r\nblue and to be marked with certain characteristic bars; that in every\r\nchild in a six-fingered family there should be the capacity for the\r\nproduction of an additional digit; and so in other cases. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is no more inherent improbability in this being the case than in\r\na useless and rudimentary organ, or even in only a tendency to the\r\nproduction of a rudimentary organ, being inherited during millions of\r\ngenerations, as is well known to occur with a multitude of organic\r\nbeings. There is no more inherent improbability in each domestic pig,\r\nduring a thousand generations, retaining the capacity and tendency to\r\ndevelop great tusks under fitting conditions, than in the young calf\r\nhaving retained, for an indefinite number of generations rudimentary\r\nincisor teeth, which never protrude through the gums.\r\n\r\nI shall give at the end of the next chapter a summary of the three\r\npreceding chapters; but as isolated and striking cases of reversion\r\nhave here been chiefly insisted on, I wish to guard the reader against\r\nsupposing that reversion is due to some rare or accidental combination\r\nof circumstances. When a character, lost during hundreds of\r\ngenerations, suddenly reappears, no doubt some such combination must\r\noccur; but reversions, to the immediately preceding generations may be\r\nconstantly observed, at least, in the offspring of most unions. This\r\nhas been universally recognised in the case of hybrids and mongrels,\r\nbut it has been recognised simply from the difference between the\r\nunited forms rendering the resemblance of the offspring to their\r\ngrandparents or more remote progenitors of easy detection. Reversion is\r\nlikewise almost invariably the rule, as Mr. Sedgwick has shown, with\r\ncertain diseases. Hence we must conclude that a tendency to this\r\npeculiar form of transmission is an integral part of the general law of\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n_Monstrosities._—A large number of monstrous growths and of lesser\r\nanomalies are admitted by every one to be due to an arrest of\r\ndevelopment, that is, to the persistence of an embryonic condition. But\r\nmany monstrosities cannot be thus explained; for parts of which no\r\ntrace can be detected in the embryo, but which occur in other members\r\nof the same class of animals occasionally appear, and these may\r\nprobably with truth be attributed to reversion. As, however, I have\r\ntreated this subject as fully as I could in my ‘Descent of Man’ (ch. 1\r\n2nd edition), I will not here recur to it.\r\n\r\nWhen flowers which have normally an irregular structure become regular\r\nor peloric, the change is generally looked at by botanists as a return\r\nto the primitive state. But Dr. Maxwell Masters,[68] who has ably\r\ndiscussed this subject, remarks that when, for instance, all the sepals\r\nof a Tropæolum become green and of the same shape, instead of being\r\ncoloured with one prolonged into a spur, or when all the petals of a\r\nLinaria become simple and regular, such cases may be due merely to an\r\narrest of development; for in these flowers all the organs during their\r\nearliest condition are symmetrical, and, if arrested at this stage of\r\ngrowth, they would not become irregular. If, moreover, the arrest were\r\nto take place at a still earlier period of development, the result\r\nwould be a simple tuft of green leaves; and no one probably would call\r\nthis a case of reversion. Dr. Masters designates the cases first\r\nalluded to as regular peloria; and others, in which all the\r\ncorresponding parts assume a similar form of irregularity, as when all\r\nthe petals in a Linaria become spurred, as irregular peloria. We have\r\nno right to attribute these latter cases to reversion, until it can be\r\nshown that the parent-form, for instance, of the genus Linaria had had\r\nall its petals spurred; for a chance of this nature might result from\r\nthe spreading of an anomalous structure, in accordance with the law, to\r\nbe discussed in a future chapter, of homologous parts tending to vary\r\nin the same manner. But as both forms of peloria frequently occur on\r\nthe same individual plant of the Linaria,[69] they probably stand in\r\nsome close relation to one another. On the doctrine that peloria is\r\nsimply the result of an arrest of development, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how an organ arrested at a very early period of growth\r\nshould acquire its full functional perfection;—how a petal, supposed to\r\nbe thus arrested, should acquire its brilliant colours, and serve as an\r\nenvelope to the flower, or a stamen produce efficient pollen; yet this\r\noccurs with many peloric flowers. That pelorism is not due to mere\r\nchance variability, but either to an arrest of development or to\r\nreversion, we may infer from an observation made by Ch. Morren[70]\r\nnamely, that families which have irregular flowers often “return by\r\nthese monstrous growths to their regular form; whilst we never see a\r\nregular flower realise the structure of an irregular one.”\r\n\r\nSome flowers have almost certainly become more or less completely\r\npeloric through reversion, as the following interesting case shows.\r\n_Corydalis tuberosa_ properly has one of its two nectaries colourless,\r\ndestitute of nectar, only half the size of the other, and therefore, to\r\na certain extent, in a rudimentary state; the pistil is curved towards\r\nthe perfect nectary, and the hood, formed of the inner petals, slips\r\noff the pistil and stamen in one direction alone, so that, when a bee\r\nsucks the perfect nectary, the stigma and stamens are exposed and\r\nrubbed against the insect’s body. In several closely allied genera, as\r\nin Dielytra, etc., there are two perfect nectaries, the pistil is\r\nstraight, and the hood slips off on either side, according as the bee\r\nsucks either nectary. Now, I have examined several flowers of\r\n_Corydalis tuberosa,_ in which both nectaries were equally developed\r\nand contained nectar; in this we see only the redevelopment of a\r\npartially aborted organ; but with this redevelopment the pistil becomes\r\nstraight, and the hood slips off in either direction, so that these\r\nflowers have acquired the perfect structure, so well adapted for insect\r\nagency, of Dielytra and its allies. We cannot attribute these coadapted\r\nmodifications to chance, or to correlated variability; we must\r\nattribute them to reversion to a primordial condition of the species.\r\n\r\nThe peloric flowers of Pelargonium have their five petals in all\r\nrespects alike, and there is no nectary so that they resemble the\r\nsymmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus Geranium; but the\r\nalternate stamens are also sometimes destitute of anthers, the\r\nshortened filaments being left as rudiments, and in this respect they\r\nresemble the symmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus Erodium.\r\nHence we may look at the peloric flowers of Pelargonium as having\r\nreverted to the state of some primordial form, the progenitor of the\r\nthree closely related genera of Pelargonium, Geranium, and Erodium.\r\n\r\nIn the peloric form of _Antirrhinum majus,_ appropriately called the\r\n“_Wonder,_” the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully from\r\nthose of the common snapdragon; the calyx and the mouth of the corolla\r\nconsist of six equal lobes, and include six equal instead of four\r\nunequal stamens. One of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed\r\nby the development of a microscopically minute papilla, which may be\r\nfound at the base of the upper lip of the flower of the common\r\nsnapdragons in the nineteen plants examined by me. That this papilla is\r\na rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various degrees of\r\ndevelopment in crossed plants between the common and the peloric\r\nAntirrhinum. Again, a peloric _Galeobdolon luteum,_ growing in my\r\ngarden, had five equal petals, all striped like the ordinary lower lip,\r\nand included five equal instead of four unequal stamens; but Mr. R.\r\nKeeley, who sent me this plant, informs me that the flowers vary\r\ngreatly, having from four to six lobes to the corolla, and from three\r\nto six stamens.[71] Now, as the members of the two great families to\r\nwhich the Antirrhinum and Galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous,\r\nwith some of the parts confluent and others suppressed, we ought not to\r\nlook at the sixth stamen and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either\r\ncase as due to reversion, any more than the additional petals in double\r\nflowers in these same two families. But the case is different with the\r\nfifth stamen in the peloric Antirrhinum, which is produced by the\r\nredevelopment of a rudiment always present, and which probably reveals\r\nto us the state of the flower, as far as the stamens are concerned, at\r\nsome ancient epoch. It is also difficult to believe that the other four\r\nstamens and the petals, after an arrest of development at a very early\r\nembryonic age, would have come to full perfection in colour, structure,\r\nand function, unless these organs had at some former period normally\r\npassed through a similar course of growth. Hence it appears to me\r\nprobable that the progenitor of the genus Antirrhinum must at some\r\nremote epoch have included five stamens and borne flowers in some\r\ndegree resembling those now produced by the peloric form. The\r\nconclusion that peloria is not a mere monstrosity, irrespective of any\r\nformer state of the species, is supported by the fact that this\r\nstructure is often strongly inherited, as in the case of the peloric\r\nAntirrhinum and Gloxinia and sometimes in that of the peloric\r\n_Corydalis solida_.[72]\r\n\r\nLastly I may add that many instances have been recorded of flowers, not\r\ngenerally considered as peloric, in which certain organs are abnormally\r\naugmented in number. As an increase of parts cannot be looked at as an\r\narrest of development, nor as due to the redevelopment of rudiments,\r\nfor no rudiments are present, and as these additional parts bring the\r\nplant into closer relationship with its natural allies, they ought\r\nprobably to be viewed as reversions to a primordial condition.\r\n\r\nThese several facts show us in an interesting manner how intimately\r\ncertain abnormal states are connected together; namely, arrests of\r\ndevelopment causing parts to become rudimentary or to be wholly\r\nsuppressed,—the redevelopment of parts now in a more or less\r\nrudimentary condition,—the reappearance of organs of which not a\r\nvestige can be detected,—and to these may be added, in the case of\r\nanimals, the presence during youth, and subsequent disappearance, of\r\ncertain characters which occasionally are retained throughout life.\r\nSome naturalists look at all such abnormal structures as a return to\r\nthe ideal state of the group to which the affected being belongs; but\r\nit is difficult to conceive what is meant to be conveyed by this\r\nexpression. Other naturalists maintain, with greater probability and\r\ndistinctness of view, that the common bond of connection between the\r\nseveral foregoing cases is an actual, though partial, return to the\r\nstructure of the ancient progenitor of the group. If this view be\r\ncorrect, we must believe that a vast number of characters, capable of\r\nevolution, lie hidden in every organic being. But it would be a mistake\r\nto suppose that the number is equally great in all beings. We know, for\r\ninstance, that plants of many orders occasionally become peloric; but\r\nmany more cases have been observed in the Labiatæ and Scrophulariaceæ\r\nthan in any other order; and in one genus of the Scrophulariaceæ,\r\nnamely Linaria, no less than thirteen species have been described in\r\nthis condition.[73] On this view of the nature of peloric flowers, and\r\nbearing in mind certain monstrosities in the animal kingdom, we must\r\nconclude that the progenitors of most plants and animals have left an\r\nimpression, capable of redevelopment, on the germs of their\r\ndescendants, although these have since been profoundly modified.\r\n\r\nThe fertilised germ of one of the higher animals, subjected as it is to\r\nso vast a series of changes from the germinal cell to old\r\nage,—incessantly agitated by what Quatrefages well calls the\r\n_tourbillon vital,_—is perhaps the most wonderful object in nature. It\r\nis probable that hardly a change of any kind affects either parent,\r\nwithout some mark being left on the germ. But on the doctrine of\r\nreversion, as given in this chapter, the germ becomes a far more\r\nmarvellous object, for, besides the visible changes which it undergoes,\r\nwe must believe that it is crowded with invisible characters, proper to\r\nboth sexes, to both the right and left side of the body, and to a long\r\nline of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds or even\r\nthousands of generations from the present time: and these characters,\r\nlike those written on paper with invisible ink, lie ready to be evolved\r\nwhenever the organisation is disturbed by certain known or unknown\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Youatt on Sheep, pp. 20, 234.

In\r\nthe present chapter some other related phenomena will be treated of, as\r\nfully as my materials permit.\r\n\r\n      _Fixedness of Character._\r\n\r\nIt is a general belief amongst breeders that the longer any character\r\nhas been transmitted by a breed, the more fully it will continue to be\r\ntransmitted. I do not wish to dispute the truth of the proposition that\r\ninheritance gains strength simply through long continuance, but I doubt\r\nwhether it can be proved. In one sense the proposition is little better\r\nthan a truism; if any character has remained constant during many\r\ngenerations, it will be likely to continue so, if the conditions of\r\nlife remain the same. So, again, in improving a breed, if care be taken\r\nfor a length of time to exclude all inferior individuals, the breed\r\nwill obviously tend to become truer, as it will not have been crossed\r\nduring many generations by an inferior animal. We have previously seen,\r\nbut without being able to assign any cause, that, when a new character\r\nappears, it is occasionally from the first constant, or fluctuates\r\nmuch, or wholly fails to be transmitted. So it is with the aggregate of\r\nslight differences which characterise a new variety, for some propagate\r\ntheir kind from the first much truer than others. Even with plants\r\nmultiplied by bulbs, layers, etc., which may in one sense be said to\r\nform parts of the same individual, it is well known that certain\r\nvarieties retain and transmit through successive bud-generations their\r\nnewly-acquired characters more truly than others. In none of these, nor\r\nin the following cases, does there appear to be any relation between\r\nthe force with which a character is transmitted and the length of time\r\nduring which it has been transmitted. Some varieties, such as white and\r\nyellow hyacinths and white sweet-peas, transmit their colours more\r\nfaithfully than do the varieties which have retained their natural\r\ncolour. In the Irish family, mentioned in the twelfth chapter, the\r\npeculiar tortoiseshell-like colouring of the eyes was transmitted far\r\nmore faithfully than any ordinary colour. Ancon and Mauchamp sheep and\r\nniata cattle, which are all comparatively modern breeds, exhibit\r\nremarkably strong powers of inheritance. Many similar cases could be\r\nadduced.\r\n\r\nAs all domesticated animals and cultivated plants have varied, and yet\r\nare descended from aboriginally wild forms, which no doubt had retained\r\nthe same character from an immensely remote epoch, we see that scarcely\r\nany degree of antiquity ensures a character being transmitted perfectly\r\ntrue. In this case, however, it may be said that changed conditions of\r\nlife induce certain modifications, and not that the power of\r\ninheritance fails; but in every case of failure, some cause, either\r\ninternal or external, must interfere. It will generally be found that\r\nthe organs or parts which in our domesticated productions have varied,\r\nor which still continue to vary,—that is, which fail to retain their\r\nformer state,—are the same with the parts which differ in the natural\r\nspecies of the same genus. As, on the theory of descent with\r\nmodification, the species of the same genus have been modified since\r\nthey branched off from a common progenitor, it follows that the\r\ncharacters by which they differ from one another have varied, whilst\r\nother parts of the organisation have remained unchanged; and it might\r\nbe argued that these same characters now vary under domestication, or\r\nfail to be inherited, from their lesser antiquity. But variation in a\r\nstate of nature seems to stand in some close relation with changed\r\nconditions of life, and characters which have already varied under such\r\nconditions would be apt to vary under the still greater changes\r\nconsequent on domestication, independently of their greater or less\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nFixedness of character, or the strength of inheritance, has often been\r\njudged of by the preponderance of certain characters in the crossed\r\noffspring between distinct races; but prepotency of transmission here\r\ncomes into play, and this, as we shall immediately see, is a very\r\ndifferent consideration from the strength or weakness of\r\ninheritance.[1] It has often been observed that breeds of animals\r\ninhabiting wild and mountainous countries cannot be permanently\r\nmodified by our improved breeds; and as these latter are of modern\r\norigin, it has been thought that the greater antiquity of the wilder\r\nbreeds has been the cause of their resistance to improvement by\r\ncrossing; but it is more probably due to their structure and\r\nconstitution being better adapted to the surrounding conditions. When\r\nplants are first subjected to culture, it has been found that, during\r\nseveral generations, they transmit their characters truly, that is, do\r\nnot vary, and this has been attributed to ancient characters being\r\nstrongly inherited: but it may with equal or greater probability be\r\nconsequent on changed conditions of life requiring a long time for\r\ntheir cumulative action. Notwithstanding these considerations, it would\r\nperhaps be rash to deny that characters become more strongly fixed the\r\nlonger they are transmitted; but I believe that the proposition\r\nresolves itself into this,—that characters of all kinds, whether new or\r\nold, tend to be inherited, and that those which have already withstood\r\nall counteracting influences and been truly transmitted, will, as a\r\ngeneral rule, continue to withstand them, and consequently be\r\nfaithfully inherited.\r\n\r\n_Prepotency in the Transmission of Character._\r\n\r\nWhen individuals, belonging to the same family, but distinct enough to\r\nbe recognised, or when two well-marked races, or two species, are\r\ncrossed, the usual result, as stated in the previous chapter, is, that\r\nthe offspring in the first generation are intermediate between their\r\nparents, or resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in\r\nanother part. But this is by no means the invariable rule; for in many\r\ncases it is found that certain individuals, races, and species, are\r\nprepotent in transmitting their likeness. This subject has been ably\r\ndiscussed by Prosper Lucas,[2] but is rendered extremely complex by the\r\nprepotency sometimes running equally in both sexes, and sometimes more\r\nstrongly in one sex than in the other; it is likewise complicated by\r\nthe presence of secondary sexual characters, which render the\r\ncomparison of crossed breeds with their parents difficult.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that in certain families some one ancestor, and after\r\nhim others in the same family, have had great power in transmitting\r\ntheir likeness through the male line; for we cannot otherwise\r\nunderstand how the same features should so often be transmitted after\r\nmarriages with many females, as in the case of the Austrian Emperors;\r\nand so it was, according to Niebuhr, with the mental qualities of\r\ncertain Roman families.[3] The famous bull Favourite is believed[4] to\r\nhave had a prepotent influence on the shorthorn race. It has also been\r\nobserved[5] with English racehorses that certain mares have generally\r\ntransmitted their own character, whilst other mares of equally pure\r\nblood have allowed the character of the sire to prevail. A famous black\r\ngreyhound, Bedlamite, as I hear from Mr. C. M. Brown “invariably got\r\nall his puppies black, no matter what was the colour of the bitch;” but\r\nthen Bedlamite “had a preponderance of black in his blood, both on the\r\nsire and dam side.”\r\n\r\nThe truth of the principle of prepotency comes out more clearly when\r\ndistinct races are crossed. The improved Shorthorns, notwithstanding\r\nthat the breed is comparatively modern, are generally acknowledged to\r\npossess great power in impressing their likeness on all other breeds;\r\nand it is chiefly in consequence of this power that they are so highly\r\nvalued for exportation.[6] Godine has given a curious case of a ram of\r\na goat-like breed of sheep from the Cape of Good Hope, which produced\r\noffspring hardly to be distinguished from himself, when crossed with\r\newes of twelve other breeds. But two of these half-bred ewes, when put\r\nto a merino ram, produced lambs closely resembling the merino breed.\r\nGirou de Buzareingues[7] found that of two races of French sheep the\r\newes of one, when crossed during successive generations with merino\r\nrams, yielded up their character far sooner than the ewes of the other\r\nrace. Sturm and Girou have given analogous cases with other breeds of\r\nsheep and with cattle, the prepotency running in these cases through\r\nthe male side; but I was assured on good authority in South America,\r\nthat when niata cattle are crossed with common cattle, though the niata\r\nbreed is prepotent whether males or females are used, yet that the\r\nprepotency is strongest through the female line. The Manx cat is\r\ntailless and has long hind legs; Dr. Wilson crossed a male Manx with\r\ncommon cats, and, out of twenty-three kittens, seventeen were destitute\r\nof tails; but when the female Manx was crossed by common male cats all\r\nthe kittens had tails, though they were generally short and\r\nimperfect.[8]\r\n\r\nIn making reciprocal crosses between pouter and fantail pigeons, the\r\npouter-race seemed to be prepotent through both sexes over the fantail.\r\nBut this is probably due to weak power in the fantail rather than to\r\nany unusually strong power in the pouter, for I have observed that\r\nbarbs also preponderate over fantails. This weakness of transmission in\r\nthe fantail, though the breed is an ancient one, is said[9] to be\r\ngeneral; but I have observed one exception to the rule, namely, in a\r\ncross between a fantail and laugher. The most curious instance known to\r\nme of weak power in both sexes is in the trumpeter pigeon. This breed\r\nhas been well known for at least 130 years: it breeds perfectly true,\r\nas I have been assured by those who have long kept many birds: it is\r\ncharacterised by a peculiar tuft of feathers over the beak, by a crest\r\non the head, by a singular coo quite unlike that of any other breed,\r\nand by much-feathered feet. I have crossed both sexes with turbits of\r\ntwo sub-breeds, with almond tumblers, spots, and runts, and reared many\r\nmongrels and recrossed them; and though the crest on the head and\r\nfeathered feet were inherited (as is generally the case with most\r\nbreeds), I have never seen a vestige of the tuft over the beak or heard\r\nthe peculiar coo. Boitard and Corbié[10] assert that this is the\r\ninvariable result of crossing trumpeters with other breeds:\r\nNeumeister,[11] however, states that in Germany mongrels have been\r\nobtained, though very rarely, which were furnished with the tuft and\r\nwould trumpet: but a pair of these mongrels with a tuft, which I\r\nimported, never trumpeted. Mr. Brent states[12] that the crossed\r\noffspring of a trumpeter were crossed with trumpeters for three\r\ngenerations, by which time the mongrels had 7/8ths of this blood in\r\ntheir veins, yet the tuft over the beak did not appear. At the fourth\r\ngeneration the tuft appeared, but the birds though now having 15-16ths\r\ntrumpeter’s blood still did not trumpet. This case well shows the wide\r\ndifference between inheritance and prepotency; for here we have a\r\nwell-established old race which transmits its characters faithfully,\r\nbut which, when crossed with any other race, has the feeblest power of\r\ntransmitting its two chief characteristic qualities.\r\n\r\nI will give one other instance with fowls and pigeons of weakness and\r\nstrength in the transmission of the same character to their crossed\r\noffspring. The Silk fowl breeds true, and there is reason to believe is\r\na very ancient race; but when I reared a large number of mongrels from\r\na Silk hen by a Spanish cock, not one exhibited even a trace of the\r\nso-called silkiness. Mr. Hewitt also asserts that in no instance are\r\nthe silky feathers transmitted by this breed when crossed with any\r\nother variety. But three birds out of many raised by Mr. Orton from a\r\ncross between a silk cock and a bantam hen had silky feathers.[13] So\r\nthat it is certain that this breed very seldom has the power of\r\ntransmitting its peculiar plumage to its crossed progeny. On the other\r\nhand, there is a silk sub-variety of the fantail pigeon, which has its\r\nfeathers in nearly the same state as in the Silk fowl: now we have\r\nalready seen that fantails, when crossed, possess singularly weak power\r\nin transmitting their general qualities; but the silk sub-variety when\r\ncrossed with any other small-sized race invariably transmits its silky\r\nfeathers![14]\r\n\r\nThe well-known horticulturist, Mr. Paul, informs me that he fertilised\r\nthe Black Prince hollyhock with pollen of the White Globe and the\r\nLemonade and Black Prince hollyhocks reciprocally; but not one seedling\r\nfrom these three crosses inherited the black colour of the Black\r\nPrince. So, again, Mr. Laxton, who has had such great experience in\r\ncrossing peas, writes to me that “whenever a cross has been effected\r\nbetween a white-blossomed and a purple-blossomed pea, or between a\r\nwhite-seeded and a purple-spotted, brown or maple-seeded pea, the\r\noffspring seems to lose nearly all the characteristics of the\r\nwhite-flowered and white-seeded varieties; and this result follows\r\nwhether these varieties have been used as the pollen-bearing or\r\nseed-producing parents.”\r\n\r\nThe law of prepotency comes into action when species are crossed, as\r\nwith races and individuals. Gärtner has unequivocally shown[15] that\r\nthis is the case with plants. To give one instance: when _Nicotiana\r\npaniculata_ and _ vincæflora_ are crossed, the character of _N.\r\npaniculata_ is almost completely lost in the hybrid; but if _ N.\r\nquadrivalvis_ be crossed with _N. vincæflora,_ this latter species,\r\nwhich was before so prepotent, now in its turn almost disappears under\r\nthe power of _N. quadrivalvis._ It is remarkable that the prepotency of\r\none species over another in transmission is quite independent, as shown\r\nby Gärtner, of the greater or less facility with which the one\r\nfertilises the other.\r\n\r\nWith animals, the jackal is prepotent over the dog, as is stated by\r\nFlourens, who made many crosses between these animals; and this was\r\nlikewise the case with a hybrid which I once saw between a jackal and a\r\nterrier. I cannot doubt, from the observations of Colin and others,\r\nthat the ass is prepotent over the horse; the prepotency in this\r\ninstance running more strongly through the male than through the female\r\nass; so that the mule resembles the ass more closely than does the\r\nhinny.[16] The male pheasant, judging from Mr. Hewitt’s\r\ndescriptions,[17] and from the hybrids which I have seen, preponderates\r\nover the domestic fowl; but the latter, as far as colour is concerned,\r\nhas considerable power of transmission, for hybrids raised from five\r\ndifferently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage. I formerly\r\nexamined some curious hybrids in the Zoological Gardens, between the\r\nPenguin variety of the common duck and the Egyptian goose (_Anser\r\nægyptiacus_); and although I will not assert that the domesticated\r\nvariety preponderated over the natural species, yet it had strongly\r\nimpressed its unnatural upright figure on these hybrids.\r\n\r\nI am aware that such cases as the foregoing have been ascribed by\r\nvarious authors, not to one species, race, or individual being\r\nprepotent over the other in impressing its character on its crossed\r\noffspring, but to such rules as that the father influences the external\r\ncharacters and the mother the internal or vital organs. But the great\r\ndiversity of the rules given by various authors almost proves their\r\nfalseness. Dr. Prosper Lucas has fully discussed this point, and has\r\nshown[18] that none of the rules (and I could add others to those\r\nquoted by him) apply to all animals. Similar rules have been announced\r\nfor plants, and have been proved by Gärtner[19] to be all erroneous. If\r\nwe confine our view to the domesticated races of a single species, or\r\nperhaps even to the species of the same genus, some such rules may hold\r\ngood; for instance, it seems that in reciprocally crossing various\r\nbreeds of fowls the male generally gives colour;[20] but conspicuous\r\nexceptions have passed under my own eyes. It seems that the ram usually\r\ngives its peculiar horns and fleece to its crossed offspring, and the\r\nbull the presence or absence of horns.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter on Crossing I shall have occasion to show that\r\ncertain characters are rarely or never blended by crossing, but are\r\ntransmitted in an unmodified state from either parent-form; I refer to\r\nthis fact here because it is sometimes accompanied on the one side by\r\nprepotency, which thus acquires the false appearance of unusual\r\nstrength. In the same chapter I shall show that the rate at which a\r\nspecies or breed absorbs and obliterates another by repeated crosses,\r\ndepends in chief part on prepotency in transmission.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some of the cases above given,—for instance, that of the\r\ntrumpeter pigeon,—prove that there is a wide difference between mere\r\ninheritance and prepotency. This latter power seems to us, in our\r\nignorance, to act in most cases quite capriciously. The very same\r\ncharacter, even though it be an abnormal or monstrous one, such as\r\nsilky feathers, may be transmitted by different species, when crossed,\r\neither with prepotent force or singular feebleness. It is obvious, that\r\na purely-bred form of either sex, in all cases in which prepotency does\r\nnot run more strongly in one sex than the other, will transmit its\r\ncharacter with prepotent force over a mongrelised and already variable\r\nform.[21] From several of the above-given cases we may conclude that\r\nmere antiquity of character does not by any means necessarily make it\r\nprepotent. In some cases prepotency apparently depends on the same\r\ncharacter being present and visible in one of the two breeds which are\r\ncrossed, and latent or invisible in the other breed; and in this case\r\nit is natural that the character which is potentially present in both\r\nbreeds should be prepotent. Thus, we have reason to believe that there\r\nis a latent tendency in all horses to be dun-coloured and striped; and\r\nwhen a horse of this kind is crossed with one of any other colour, it\r\nis said that the offspring are almost sure to be striped. Sheep have a\r\nsimilar latent tendency to become dark-coloured, and we have seen with\r\nwhat prepotent force a ram with a few black spots, when crossed with\r\nwhite sheep of various breeds, coloured its offspring. All pigeons have\r\na latent tendency to become slaty-blue, with certain characteristic\r\nmarks, and it is known that, when a bird thus coloured is crossed with\r\none of any other colour, it is most difficult afterwards to eradicate\r\nthe blue tint. A nearly parallel case is offered by those black bantams\r\nwhich, as they grow old, develop a latent tendency to acquire red\r\nfeathers. But there are exceptions to the rule: hornless breeds of\r\ncattle possess a latent capacity to reproduce horns, yet when crossed\r\nwith horned breeds they do not invariably produce offspring bearing\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nWe meet with analogous cases with plants. Striped flowers, though they\r\ncan be propagated truly by seed, have a latent tendency to become\r\nuniformly coloured, but when once crossed by a uniformly coloured\r\nvariety, they ever afterwards fail to produce striped seedlings.[22]\r\nAnother case is in some respects more curious: plants bearing peloric\r\nflowers have so strong a latent tendency to reproduce their normally\r\nirregular flowers, that this often occurs by buds when a plant is\r\ntransplanted into poorer or richer soil.[23] Now I crossed the peloric\r\nsnapdragon (_Antirrhinum majus_), described in the last chapter, with\r\npollen of the common form; and the latter, reciprocally, with peloric\r\npollen. I thus raised two great beds of seedlings, and not one was\r\npeloric. Naudin[24] obtained the same result from crossing a peloric\r\nLinaria with the common form. I carefully examined the flowers of\r\nninety plants of the crossed Antirrhinum in the two beds, and their\r\nstructure had not been in the least affected by the cross, except that\r\nin a few instances the minute rudiment of the fifth stamen, which is\r\nalways present, was more fully or even completely developed. It must\r\nnot be supposed that this entire obliteration of the peloric structure\r\nin the crossed plants can be accounted for by any incapacity of\r\ntransmission; for I raised a large bed of plants from the peloric\r\nAntirrhinum, artificially fertilised by its own pollen, and sixteen\r\nplants, which alone survived the winter, were all as perfectly peloric\r\nas the parent-plant. Here we have a good instance of the wide\r\ndifference between the inheritance of a character and the power of\r\ntransmitting it to crossed offspring. The crossed plants, which\r\nperfectly resembled the common snapdragon, were allowed to sow\r\nthemselves, and out of a hundred and twenty-seven seedlings,\r\neighty-eight proved to be common snapdragons, two were in an\r\nintermediate condition between the peloric and normal state, and\r\nthirty-seven were perfectly peloric, having reverted to the structure\r\nof their one grand-parent. This case seems at first sight to offer an\r\nexception to the rule just given, namely, that a character which is\r\npresent in one form and latent in the other is generally transmitted\r\nwith prepotent force when the two forms are crossed. For in all the\r\nScrophulariaceæ, and especially in the genera Antirrhinum and Linaria,\r\nthere is, as was shown in the last chapter, a strong latent tendency to\r\nbecome peloric; but there is also, as we have seen, a still stronger\r\ntendency in all peloric plants to reacquire their normal irregular\r\nstructure. So that we have two opposed latent tendencies in the same\r\nplants. Now, with the crossed Antirrhinums the tendency to produce\r\nnormal or irregular flowers, like those of the common Snapdragon,\r\nprevailed in the first generation; whilst the tendency to pelorism,\r\nappearing to gain strength by the intermission of a generation,\r\nprevailed to a large extent in the second set of seedlings. How it is\r\npossible for a character to gain strength by the intermission of a\r\ngeneration, will be considered in the chapter on pangenesis.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the subject of prepotency is extremely intricate,—from\r\nits varying so much in strength, even in regard to the same character,\r\nin different animals,—from its running either equally in both sexes,\r\nor, as frequently is the case with animals, but not with plants, much\r\nstronger in one sex than the other,—from the existence of secondary\r\nsexual characters,—from the transmission of certain characters being\r\nlimited, as we shall immediately see, by sex,—from certain characters\r\nnot blending together,—and, perhaps, occasionally from the effects of a\r\nprevious fertilisation on the mother. It is therefore not surprising\r\nthat no one has hitherto succeeded in drawing up general rules on the\r\nsubject of prepotency.\r\n\r\n      _Inheritance as limited by Sex._\r\n\r\nNew characters often appear in one sex, and are afterwards transmitted\r\nto the same sex, either exclusively or in a much greater degree than to\r\nthe other. This subject is important, because with animals of many\r\nkinds in a state of nature, both high and low in the scale, secondary\r\nsexual characters, not directly connected with the organs of\r\nreproduction, are conspicuously present. With our domesticated animals,\r\ncharacters of this kind often differ widely from those distinguishing\r\nthe two sexes of the parent species; and the principle of inheritance,\r\nas limited by sex, explains how this is possible.\r\n\r\nDr. P. Lucas has shown[25] that when a peculiarity, in no manner\r\nconnected with the reproductive organs, appears in either parent, it is\r\noften transmitted exclusively to the offspring of the same sex, or to a\r\nmuch greater number of them than of the opposite sex. Thus, in the\r\nfamily of Lambert, the horn-like projections on the skin were\r\ntransmitted from the father to his sons and grandsons alone; so it has\r\nbeen with other cases of ichthyosis, with supernumerary digits, with a\r\ndeficiency of digits and phalanges, and in a lesser degree with various\r\ndiseases, especially with colour-blindness and the hæmorrhagic\r\ndiathesis, that is, an extreme liability to profuse and uncontrollable\r\nbleeding from trifling wounds. On the other hand, mothers have\r\ntransmitted, during several generations, to their daughters alone,\r\nsupernumerary and deficient digits, colour-blindness and other\r\npeculiarities. So that the very same peculiarity may become attached to\r\neither sex, and be long inherited by that sex alone; but the attachment\r\nin certain cases is much more frequent to one than the other sex. The\r\nsame peculiarities also may be promiscuously transmitted to either sex.\r\nDr. Lucas gives other cases, showing that the male occasionally\r\ntransmits his peculiarities to his daughters alone, and the mother to\r\nher sons alone; but even in this case we see that inheritance is to a\r\ncertain extent, though inversely, regulated by sex. Dr. Lucas, after\r\nweighing the whole evidence, comes to the conclusion that every\r\npeculiarity tends to be transmitted in a greater or lesser degree to\r\nthat sex in which it first appears. But a more definite rule, as I have\r\nelsewhere shown[26] generally holds good, namely, that variations which\r\nfirst appear in either sex at a late period of life, when the\r\nreproductive functions are active, tend to be developed in that sex\r\nalone; whilst variations which first appear early in life in either sex\r\nare commonly transmitted to both sexes. I am, however, far from\r\nsupposing that this is the sole determining cause.\r\n\r\nA few details from the many cases collected by Mr. Sedgwick,[27] may be\r\nhere given. Colour-blindness, from some unknown cause, shows itself\r\nmuch oftener in males than in females; in upwards of two hundred cases\r\ncollected by Mr. Sedgwick, nine-tenths related to men; but it is\r\neminently liable to be transmitted through women. In the case given by\r\nDr. Earle, members of eight related families were affected during five\r\ngenerations: these families consisted of sixty-one individuals, namely,\r\nof thirty-two males, of whom nine-sixteenths were incapable of\r\ndistinguishing colour, and of twenty-nine females, of whom only\r\none-fifteenth were thus affected. Although colour-blindness thus\r\ngenerally clings to the male sex, nevertheless, in one instance in\r\nwhich it first appeared in a female, it was transmitted during five\r\ngenerations to thirteen individuals, all of whom were females. The\r\nhæmorrhagic diathesis, often accompanied by rheumatism, has been known\r\nto affect the males alone during five generations, being transmitted,\r\nhowever, through the females. It is said that deficient phalanges in\r\nthe fingers have been inherited by the females alone during ten\r\ngenerations. In another case, a man thus deficient in both hands and\r\nfeet, transmitted the peculiarity to his two sons and one daughter; but\r\nin the third generation,—out of nineteen grandchildren, twelve sons had\r\nthe family defect, whilst the seven daughters were free. In ordinary\r\ncases of sexual limitation, the sons or daughters inherit the\r\npeculiarity, whatever it may be, from their father or mother, and\r\ntransmit it to their children of the same sex; but generally with the\r\nhæmorrhagic diathesis, and often with colour-blindness, and in some\r\nother cases, the sons never inherit the peculiarity directly from their\r\nfathers, but the daughters alone transmit the latent tendency, so that\r\nthe sons of the daughters alone exhibit it. Thus the father, grandson,\r\nand great-great-grandson will exhibit a peculiarity,—the grandmother,\r\ndaughter, and great-grand-daughter having transmitted it in a latent\r\nstate. Hence we have, as Mr. Sedgwick remarks, a double kind of atavism\r\nor reversion; each grandson apparently receiving and developing the\r\npeculiarity from his grandfather, and each daughter apparently\r\nreceiving the latent tendency from her grandmother.\r\n\r\nFrom the various facts recorded by Dr. Prosper Lucas, Mr. Sedgwick, and\r\nothers, there can be no doubt that peculiarities first appearing in\r\neither sex, though not in any way necessarily or invariably connected\r\nwith that sex, strongly tend to be inherited by the offspring of the\r\nsame sex, but are often transmitted in a latent state through the\r\nopposite sex.\r\n\r\nTurning now to domesticated animals, we find that certain characters\r\nnot proper to the parent species are often confined to, and inherited\r\nby, one sex alone; but we do not know the history of the first\r\nappearance of such characters. In the chapter on Sheep, we have seen\r\nthat the males of certain races differ greatly from the females in the\r\nshape of their horns, these being absent in the ewes of some breeds;\r\nthey differ also in the development of fat in the tail and in the\r\noutline of the forehead. These differences, judging from the character\r\nof the allied wild species, cannot be accounted for by supposing that\r\nthey have been derived from distinct parent forms. There is, also, a\r\ngreat difference between the horns of the two sexes in one Indian breed\r\nof goats. The bull zebu is said to have a larger hump than the cow. In\r\nthe Scotch deer-hound the two sexes differ in size more than in any\r\nother variety of the dog[28] and, judging from analogy, more than in\r\nthe aboriginal parent-species. The peculiar colour called\r\ntortoise-shell is very rarely seen in a male cat; the males of this\r\nvariety being of a rusty tint.\r\n\r\nIn various breeds of the fowl the males and females often differ\r\ngreatly; and these differences are far from being the same with those\r\nwhich distinguish the two sexes of the parent-species, the _Gallus\r\nbankiva_; and consequently have originated under domestication. In\r\ncertain sub-varieties of the Game race we have the unusual case of the\r\nhens differing from each other more than the cocks. In an Indian breed\r\nof a white colour shaded with black, the hens invariably have black\r\nskins, and their bones are covered by a black periosteum, whilst the\r\ncocks are never or most rarely thus characterised. Pigeons offer a more\r\ninteresting case; for throughout the whole great family the two sexes\r\ndo not often differ much; and the males and females of the parent-form,\r\nthe _C. livia,_ are undistinguishable: yet we have seen that with\r\npouters the male has the characteristic quality of pouting more\r\nstrongly developed than the female; and in certain sub-varieties the\r\nmales alone are spotted or striated with black, or otherwise differ in\r\ncolour. When male and female English carrier-pigeons are exhibited in\r\nseparate pens, the difference in the development of the wattle over the\r\nbeak and round the eyes is conspicuous. So that here we have instances\r\nof the appearance of secondary sexual characters in the domesticated\r\nraces of a species in which such differences are naturally quite\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, secondary sexual characters which belong to the\r\nspecies in a state of nature are sometimes quite lost, or greatly\r\ndiminished, under domestication. We see this in the small size of the\r\ntusks in our improved breeds of the pig, in comparison with those of\r\nthe wild boar. There are sub-breeds of fowls, in which the males have\r\nlost the fine-flowing tail-feathers and hackles; and others in which\r\nthere is no difference in colour between the two sexes. In some cases\r\nthe barred plumage, which in gallinaceous birds is commonly the\r\nattribute of the hen, has been transferred to the cock, as in the\r\ncuckoo sub-breeds. In other cases masculine characters have been partly\r\ntransferred to the female, as with the splendid plumage of the\r\ngolden-spangled Hamburgh hen, the enlarged comb of the Spanish hen, the\r\npugnacious disposition of the Game hen, and as in the well-developed\r\nspurs which occasionally appear in the hens of various breeds. In\r\nPolish fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot, that of the male\r\nbeing formed of hackle-like feathers, and this is a new male character\r\nin the genus Gallus. On the whole, as far as I can judge, new\r\ncharacters are more apt to appear in the males of our domesticated\r\nanimals than in the females,[29] and afterwards to be inherited\r\nexclusively or more strongly by the males. Finally, in accordance with\r\nthe principle of inheritance as limited by sex, the preservation and\r\naugmentation of secondary sexual characters in natural species offers\r\nno especial difficulty, as this would follow through that form of\r\nselection which I have called sexual selection.\r\n\r\n      _Inheritance at corresponding periods of Life._\r\n\r\nThis is an important subject. Since the publication of my ‘Origin of\r\nSpecies’ I have seen no reason to doubt the truth of the explanation\r\nthere given of one of the most remarkable facts in biology, namely, the\r\ndifference between the embryo and the adult animal. The explanation is,\r\nthat variations do not necessarily or generally occur at a very early\r\nperiod of embryonic growth, and that such variations are inherited at a\r\ncorresponding age. As a consequence of this the embryo, even after the\r\nparent-form has undergone great modification, is left only slightly\r\nmodified; and the embryos of widely-different animals which are\r\ndescended from a common progenitor remain in many important respects\r\nlike one another and probably like their common progenitor. We can thus\r\nunderstand why embryology throws a flood of light on the natural system\r\nof classification, as this ought to be as far as possible genealogical.\r\nWhen the embryo leads an independent life, that is, becomes a larva, it\r\nhas to be adapted to the surrounding conditions in its structure and\r\ninstincts, independently of those of its parents; and the principle of\r\ninheritance at corresponding periods of life renders this possible.\r\n\r\nThis principle is, indeed, in one way so obvious that it escapes\r\nattention. We possess a number of races of animals and plants, which,\r\nwhen compared with one another and with their parent-forms, present\r\nconspicuous differences, both in their immature and mature states. Look\r\nat the seeds of the several kinds of peas, beans, maize, which can be\r\npropagated truly, and see how they differ in size, colour, and shape,\r\nwhilst the full-grown plants differ but little. Cabbages, on the other\r\nhand, differ greatly in foliage and manner of growth, but hardly at all\r\nin their seeds; and generally it will be found that the differences\r\nbetween cultivated plants at different periods of growth are not\r\nnecessarily closely connected together, for plants may differ much in\r\ntheir seeds and little when full-grown, and conversely may yield seeds\r\nhardly distinguishable, yet differ much when full-grown. In the several\r\nbreeds of poultry, descended from a single species, differences in the\r\neggs and chickens whilst covered with down, in the plumage at the first\r\nand subsequent moults, as well as in the comb and wattles, are all\r\ninherited. With man peculiarities in the milk and second teeth (of\r\nwhich I have received the details) are inheritable, and longevity is\r\noften transmitted. So again with our improved breeds of cattle and\r\nsheep, early maturity, including the early development of the teeth,\r\nand with certain breeds of fowl the early appearance of secondary\r\nsexual characters, all come under the same head of inheritance at\r\ncorresponding periods.\r\n\r\nNumerous analogous facts could be given. The silk-moth, perhaps, offers\r\nthe best instance; for in the breeds which transmit their characters\r\ntruly, the eggs differ in size, colour, and shape: the caterpillars\r\ndiffer, in moulting three or four times, in colour, even in having a\r\ndark-coloured mark like an eyebrow, and in the loss of certain\r\ninstincts;—the cocoons differ in size, shape, and in the colour and\r\nquality of the silk; these several differences being followed by slight\r\nor barely distinguishable differences in the mature moth.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that, if in the above cases a new peculiarity is\r\ninherited, it must be at the corresponding stage of development; for an\r\negg or seed can resemble only an egg or seed, and the horn in a\r\nfull-grown ox can resemble only a horn. The following cases show\r\ninheritance at corresponding periods more plainly, because they refer\r\nto peculiarities which might have supervened, as far as we can see,\r\nearlier or later in life, yet are inherited at the same period at which\r\nthey first appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the Lambert family the porcupine-like excrescences appeared in the\r\nfather and sons at the same age, namely, about nine weeks after\r\nbirth.[30] In the extraordinary hairy family described by Mr.\r\nCrawfurd,[31] children were produced during three generations with\r\nhairy ears; in the father the hair began to grow over his body at six\r\nyears old; in his daughter somewhat earlier, namely, at one year; and\r\nin both generations the milk teeth appeared late in life, the permanent\r\nteeth being afterwards singularly deficient. Greyness of hair at an\r\nunusually early age has been transmitted in some families. These cases\r\nborder on diseases inherited at corresponding periods of life, to which\r\nI shall immediately refer.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known peculiarity with almond-tumbler pigeons, that the\r\nfull beauty and peculiar character of the plumage does not appear until\r\nthe bird has moulted two or three times. Neumeister describes and\r\nfigures a brace of pigeons in which the whole body is white except the\r\nbreast, neck, and head; but in their first plumage all the white\r\nfeathers have coloured edges. Another breed is more remarkable: its\r\nfirst plumage is black, with rusty-red wing-bars and a crescent-shaped\r\nmark on the breast; these marks then become white, and remain so during\r\nthree or four moults; but after this period the white spreads over the\r\nbody, and the bird loses its beauty.[32] Prize canary-birds have their\r\nwings and tail black: “this colour, however, is only retained until the\r\nfirst moult, so that they must be exhibited ere the change takes place.\r\nOnce moulted, the peculiarity has ceased. Of course all the birds\r\nemanating from this stock have black wings and tails the first\r\nyear.”[33] A curious and somewhat analogous account has been given[34]\r\nof a family of wild pied rooks which were first observed in 1798, near\r\nChalfont, and which every year from that date up to the period of the\r\npublished notice, viz., 1837 “have several of their brood\r\nparticoloured, black and white. This variegation of the plumage,\r\nhowever, disappears with the first moult; but among the next young\r\nfamilies there are always a few pied ones.” These changes of plumage,\r\nwhich are inherited at various corresponding periods of life in the\r\npigeon, canary-bird, and rook, are remarkable, because the\r\nparent-species passes through no such change.\r\n\r\nInherited diseases afford evidence in some respects of less value than\r\nthe foregoing cases, because diseases are not necessarily connected\r\nwith any change in structure; but in other respects of more value,\r\nbecause the periods have been more carefully observed. Certain diseases\r\nare communicated to the child apparently by a process like inoculation,\r\nand the child is from the first affected; such cases may be here passed\r\nover. Large classes of diseases usually appear at certain ages, such as\r\nSt. Vitus’s dance in youth, consumption in early mid-life, gout later,\r\nand apoplexy still later; and these are naturally inherited at the same\r\nperiod. But even in diseases of this class, instances have been\r\nrecorded, as with St. Vitus’s dance, showing that an unusually early or\r\nlate tendency to the disease is inheritable.[35] In most cases the\r\nappearance of any inherited disease is largely determined by certain\r\ncritical periods in each person’s life, as well as by unfavourable\r\nconditions. There are many other diseases, which are not attached to\r\nany particular period, but which certainly tend to appear in the child\r\nat about the same age at which the parent was first attacked. An array\r\nof high authorities, ancient and modern, could be given in support of\r\nthis proposition. The illustrious Hunter believed in it; and Piorry[36]\r\ncautions the physician to look closely to the child at the period when\r\nany grave inheritable disease attacked the parent. Dr. Prosper\r\nLucas,[37] after collecting facts from every source, asserts that\r\naffections of all kinds, though not related to any particular period of\r\nlife, tend to reappear in the offspring at whatever period of life they\r\nfirst appeared in the progenitor.\r\n\r\nAs the subject is important, it may be well to give a few instances,\r\nsimply as illustrations, not as proof; for proof, recourse must be had\r\nto the authorities above quoted. Some of the following cases have been\r\nselected for the sake of showing that, when a slight departure from the\r\nrule occurs, the child is affected somewhat earlier in life than the\r\nparent. In the family of Le Compte blindness was inherited through\r\nthree generations, and no less than twenty-seven children and\r\ngrandchildren were all affected at about the same age; their blindness\r\nin general began to advance about the fifteenth or sixteenth year, and\r\nended in total deprivation of sight at the age of about twenty-two.[38]\r\nIn another case a father and his four children all became blind at\r\ntwenty-one years old; in another, a grandmother grew blind at\r\nthirty-five, her daughter at nineteen, and three grandchildren at the\r\nages of thirteen and eleven.[39] So with deafness, two brothers, their\r\nfather and paternal grandfather, all became deaf at the age of\r\nforty.[40]\r\n\r\nEsquirol gives several striking instances of insanity coming on at the\r\nsame age, as that of a grandfather, father, and son, who all committed\r\nsuicide near their fiftieth year. Many other cases could be given, as\r\nof a whole family who became insane at the age of forty.[41] Other\r\ncerebral affections sometimes follow the same rule,—for instance,\r\nepilepsy and apoplexy. A woman died of the latter disease when\r\nsixty-three years old; one of her daughters at forty-three, and the\r\nother at sixty-seven: the latter had twelve children, who all died from\r\ntubercular meningitis.[42] I mention this latter case because it\r\nillustrates a frequent occurrence, namely, a change in the precise\r\nnature of an inherited disease, though still affecting the same organ.\r\n\r\nAsthma has attacked several members of the same family when forty years\r\nold, and other families during infancy. The most different diseases,\r\nsuch as angina pectoris, stone in the bladder, and various affections\r\nof the skin, have appeared in successive generations at nearly the same\r\nage. The little finger of a man began from some unknown cause to grow\r\ninwards, and the same finger in his two sons began at the same age to\r\nbend inwards in a similar manner. Strange and inexplicable neuralgic\r\naffections have caused parents and children to suffer agonies at about\r\nthe same period of life.[43]\r\n\r\nI will give only two other cases, which are interesting as illustrating\r\nthe disappearance as well as the appearance of disease at the same age.\r\nTwo brothers, their father, their paternal uncles, seven cousins, and\r\ntheir paternal grandfather, were all similarly affected by a\r\nskin-disease, called pityriasis versicolor; “the disease, strictly\r\nlimited to the males of the family (though transmitted through the\r\nfemales), usually appeared at puberty, and disappeared at about the age\r\nof forty or forty-five years.” The second case is that of four\r\nbrothers, who when about twelve years old suffered almost every week\r\nfrom severe headaches, which were relieved only by a recumbent position\r\nin a dark room. Their father, paternal uncles, paternal grandfather,\r\nand granduncles all suffered in the same way from headaches, which\r\nceased at the age of fifty-four or fifty-five in all those who lived so\r\nlong. None of the females of the family were affected.[44]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read the foregoing accounts, and the many others\r\nwhich have been recorded, of diseases coming on during three or even\r\nmore generations in several members of the same family at the same age,\r\nespecially in the case of rare affections in which the coincidence\r\ncannot be attributed to chance, and to doubt that there is a strong\r\ntendency to inheritance in disease at corresponding periods of life.\r\nWhen the rule fails, the disease is apt to come on earlier in the child\r\nthan in the parent; the exceptions in the other direction being very\r\nmuch rarer. Dr. Lucas[45] alludes to several cases of inherited\r\ndiseases coming on at an earlier period. I have already given one\r\nstriking instance with blindness during three generations; and Mr.\r\nBowman remarks that this frequently occurs with cataract. With cancer\r\nthere seems to be a peculiar liability to earlier inheritance: Sir J.\r\nPaget, who has particularly attended to this subject, and tabulated a\r\nlarge number of cases, informs me that he believes that in nine cases\r\nout of ten the later generation suffers from the disease at an earlier\r\nperiod than the previous generation. He adds, “In the instances in\r\nwhich the opposite relation holds, and the members of later generations\r\nhave cancer at a later age than their predecessors, I think it will be\r\nfound that the non-cancerous parents have lived to extreme old ages.”\r\nSo that the longevity of a non-affected parent seems to have the power\r\nof influencing the fatal period in the offspring; and we thus\r\napparently get another element of complexity in inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe facts, showing that with certain diseases the period of inheritance\r\noccasionally or even frequently advances, are important with respect to\r\nthe general descent-theory, for they render it probable that the same\r\nthing would occur with ordinary modifications of structure. The final\r\nresult of a long series of such advances would be the gradual\r\nobliteration of characters proper to the embryo and larva, which would\r\nthus come to resemble more and more closely the mature parent-form. But\r\nany structure which was of service to the embryo or larva would be\r\npreserved by the destruction at this stage of growth of each individual\r\nwhich manifested any tendency to lose its proper character at too early\r\nan age.\r\n\r\nFinally, from the numerous races of cultivated plants and domestic\r\nanimals, in which the seeds or eggs, the young or old, differ from one\r\nanother and from those of the parent-species;—from the cases in which\r\nnew characters have appeared at a particular period, and afterwards\r\nbeen inherited at the same period;—and from what we know with respect\r\nto disease, we must believe in the truth of the great principle of\r\ninheritance at corresponding periods of life.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the three preceding Chapters._—Strong as is the force of\r\ninheritance, it allows the incessant appearance of new characters.\r\nThese, whether beneficial or injurious,—of the most trifling\r\nimportance, such as a shade of colour in a flower, a coloured lock of\r\nhair, or a mere gesture,—or of the highest importance, as when\r\naffecting the brain, or an organ so perfect and complex as the eye,—or\r\nof so grave a nature as to deserve to be called a monstrosity,—or so\r\npeculiar as not to occur normally in any member of the same natural\r\nclass,—often inherited by man, by the lower animals, and plants. In\r\nnumberless cases it suffices for the inheritance of a peculiarity that\r\none parent alone should be thus characterised. Inequalities in the two\r\nsides of the body, though opposed to the law of symmetry, may be\r\ntransmitted. There is ample evidence that the effects of mutilations\r\nand of accidents, especially or perhaps exclusively when followed by\r\ndisease, are occasionally inherited. There can be no doubt that the\r\nevil effects of the long-continued exposure of the parent to injurious\r\nconditions are sometimes transmitted to the offspring. So it is, as we\r\nshall see in a future chapter, with the effects of the use and disuse\r\nof parts, and of mental habits. Periodical habits are likewise\r\ntransmitted, but generally, as it would appear, with little force.\r\n\r\nHence we are led to look at inheritance as the rule, and\r\nnon-inheritance as the anomaly. But this power often appears to us in\r\nour ignorance to act capriciously, transmitting a character with\r\ninexplicable strength or feebleness. The very same peculiarity, as the\r\nweeping habit of trees, silky feathers, etc., may be inherited either\r\nfirmly or not at all by different members of the same group, and even\r\nby different individuals of the same species, though treated in the\r\nsame manner. In this latter case we see that the power of transmission\r\nis a quality which is merely individual in its attachment. As with\r\nsingle characters, so it is with the several concurrent slight\r\ndifferences which distinguish sub-varieties or races; for of these,\r\nsome can be propagated almost as truly as species, whilst others cannot\r\nbe relied on. The same rule holds good with plants, when propagated by\r\nbulbs, offsets, etc., which in one sense still form parts of the same\r\nindividual, for some varieties retain or inherit through successive\r\nbud-generations their character far more truly than others.\r\n\r\nSome characters not proper to the parent-species have certainly been\r\ninherited from an extremely remote epoch, and may therefore be\r\nconsidered as firmly fixed. But it is doubtful whether length of\r\ninheritance in itself gives fixedness of character; though the chances\r\nare obviously in favour of any character which has long been\r\ntransmitted true or unaltered still being transmitted true as long as\r\nthe conditions of life remain the same. We know that many species,\r\nafter having retained the same character for countless ages, whilst\r\nliving under their natural conditions, when domesticated have varied in\r\nthe most diversified manner, that is, have failed to transmit their\r\noriginal form; so that no character appears to be absolutely fixed. We\r\ncan sometimes account for the failure of inheritance by the conditions\r\nof life being opposed to the development of certain characters; and\r\nstill oftener, as with plants cultivated by grafts and buds, by the\r\nconditions causing new and slight modifications incessantly to appear.\r\nIn this latter case it is not that inheritance wholly fails, but that\r\nnew characters are continually superadded. In some few cases, in which\r\nboth parents are similarly characterised, inheritance seems to gain so\r\nmuch force by the combined action of the two parents, that it\r\ncounteracts its own power, and a new modification is the result.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the failure of the parents to transmit their likeness is\r\ndue to the breed having been at some former period crossed; and the\r\nchild takes after his grandparent or more remote ancestor of foreign\r\nblood. In other cases, in which the breed has not been crossed, but\r\nsome ancient character has been lost through variation, it occasionally\r\nreappears through reversion, so that the parents apparently fail to\r\ntransmit their own likeness. In all cases, however, we may safely\r\nconclude that the child inherits all its characters from its parents,\r\nin whom certain characters are latent, like the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters of one sex in the other. When, after a long succession of\r\nbud-generations, a flower or fruit becomes separated into distinct\r\nsegments, having the colours or other attributes of both parent-forms,\r\nwe cannot doubt that these characters were latent in the earlier buds,\r\nthough they could not then be detected, or could be detected only in an\r\nintimately commingled state. So it is with animals of crossed\r\nparentage, which with advancing years occasionally exhibit characters\r\nderived from one of their two parents, of which not a trace could at\r\nfirst be perceived. Certain monstrosities, which resemble what\r\nnaturalists call the typical form of the group in question, apparently\r\ncome under the same law of reversion. It is assuredly an astonishing\r\nfact that the male and female sexual elements, that buds, and even\r\nfull-grown animals, should retain characters, during several\r\ngenerations in the case of crossed breeds, and during thousands of\r\ngenerations in the case of pure breeds, written as it were in invisible\r\nink, yet ready at any time to be evolved under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nWhat these conditions precisely are, we do not know. But any cause\r\nwhich disturbs the organisation or constitution seems to be sufficient.\r\nA cross certainly gives a strong tendency to the reappearance of\r\nlong-lost characters, both corporeal and mental. In the case of plants,\r\nthis tendency is much stronger with those species which have been\r\ncrossed after long cultivation and which therefore have had their\r\nconstitutions disturbed by this cause as well as by crossing, than with\r\nspecies which have always lived under their natural conditions and have\r\nthen been crossed. A return, also, of domesticated animals and\r\ncultivated plants to a wild state favours reversion; but the tendency\r\nunder these circumstances has been much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nWhen individuals of the same family which differ somewhat, and when\r\nraces or species are crossed, the one is often prepotent over the other\r\nin transmitting its character. A race may possess a strong power of\r\ninheritance, and yet when crossed, as we have seen with\r\ntrumpeter-pigeons, yield to the prepotency of every other race.\r\nPrepotency of transmission may be equal in the two sexes of the same\r\nspecies, but often runs more strongly in one sex. It plays an important\r\npart in determining the rate at which one race can be modified or\r\nwholly absorbed by repeated crosses with another. We can seldom tell\r\nwhat makes one race or species prepotent over another; but it sometimes\r\ndepends on the same character being present and visible in one parent,\r\nand latent or potentially present in the other.\r\n\r\nCharacters may first appear in either sex, but oftener in the male than\r\nin the female, and afterwards be transmitted to the offspring of the\r\nsame sex. In this case we may feel confident that the peculiarity in\r\nquestion is really present though latent in the opposite sex! hence the\r\nfather may transmit through his daughter any character to his grandson;\r\nand the mother conversely to her granddaughter. We thus learn, and the\r\nfact is an important one, that transmission and development are\r\ndistinct powers. Occasionally these two powers seem to be antagonistic,\r\nor incapable of combination in the same individual; for several cases\r\nhave been recorded in which the son has not directly inherited a\r\ncharacter from his father, or directly transmitted it to his son, but\r\nhas received it by transmission through his non-affected mother, and\r\ntransmitted it through his non-affected daughter. Owing to inheritance\r\nbeing limited by sex, we see how secondary sexual characters may have\r\narisen under nature; their preservation and accumulation being\r\ndependent on their service to either sex.\r\n\r\nAt whatever period of life a new character first appears, it generally\r\nremains latent in the offspring until a corresponding age is attained,\r\nand then is developed. When this rule fails, the child generally\r\nexhibits the character at an earlier period than the parent. On this\r\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding periods, we can understand\r\nhow it is that most animals display from the germ to maturity such a\r\nmarvellous succession of characters.\r\n\r\nFinally, though much remains obscure with respect to Inheritance, we\r\nmay look at the following laws as fairly well established. Firstly, a\r\ntendency in every character, new and old, to be transmitted by seminal\r\nand bud generation, though often counteracted by various known and\r\nunknown causes. Secondly, reversion or atavism, which depends on\r\ntransmission and development being distinct powers: it acts in various\r\ndegrees and manners through both seminal and bud generation. Thirdly,\r\nprepotency of transmission, which may be confined to one sex, or be\r\ncommon to both sexes. Fourthly, transmission, as limited by sex,\r\ngenerally to the same sex in which the inherited character first\r\nappeared; and this in many, probably most cases, depends on the new\r\ncharacter having first appeared at a rather late period of life.\r\nFifthly, inheritance at corresponding periods of life, with some\r\ntendency to the earlier development of the inherited character. In\r\nthese laws of Inheritance, as displayed under domestication, we see an\r\nample provision for the production, through variability and natural\r\nselection, of new specific forms.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] _See_ Youatt on Cattle, pp. 92, 69, 78, 88, 163; and Youatt on\r\n Sheep, p. 325.

With\r\n respect to the difference between the mule and the hinny I am aware\r\n that this has generally been attributed to the sire and dam\r\n transmitting their characters differently; but Colin, who has given in\r\n his ‘Traité Phys. Comp.,’ tom. ii. pp. 537-539, the fullest\r\n description which I have met with of these reciprocal hybrids, is\r\n strongly of opinion that the ass preponderates in both crosses, but in\r\n an unequal degree. This is likewise the conclusion of Flourens, and of\r\n Bechstein in his ‘Naturgeschichte Deutschlands,’ b. i. s. 294. The\r\n tail of the hinny is much more like that of the horse than is the tail\r\n of the mule, and this is generally accounted for by the males of both\r\n species transmitting with greater power this part of their structure;\r\n but a compound hybrid which I saw in the Zoological Gardens, from a\r\n mare by a hybrid ass-zebra, closely resembled its mother in its tail.\r\n\r\n [17] Mr. Hewitt, who has had such great experience in raising these\r\n hybrids says (‘Poultry Book,’ by Mr. Tegetmeier, 1866, pp. 165-167)\r\n that in all, the head was destitute of wattles, comb, and ear-lappets;\r\n and all closely resembled the pheasant in the shape of the tail and\r\n general contour of the body. These hybrids were raised from hens of\r\n several breeds by a cock-pheasant; but another hybrid, described by\r\n Mr. Hewitt, was raised from a hen-pheasant, by a silver-laced Bantam\r\n cock, and this possessed a rudimental comb and wattles.\r\n\r\n [18] ‘L’Héréd.

ON CROSSING.\r\n\r\nFREE INTERCROSSING OBLITERATES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALLIED\r\nBREEDS—WHEN THE NUMBERS OF TWO COMMINGLING BREEDS ARE UNEQUAL, ONE\r\nABSORBS THE OTHER—THE RATE OF ABSORPTION DETERMINED BY PREPOTENCY OF\r\nTRANSMISSION, BY THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE, AND BY NATURAL SELECTION—ALL\r\nORGANIC BEINGS OCCASIONALLY INTERCROSS; APPARENT EXCEPTIONS—ON CERTAIN\r\nCHARACTERS INCAPABLE OF FUSION; CHIEFLY OR EXCLUSIVELY THOSE WHICH HAVE\r\nSUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE INDIVIDUAL—ON THE MODIFICATION OF OLD RACES,\r\nAND THE FORMATION OF NEW RACES BY CROSSING—SOME CROSSED RACES HAVE BRED\r\nTRUE FROM THEIR FIRST PRODUCTION—ON THE CROSSING OF DISTINCT SPECIES IN\r\nRELATION TO THE FORMATION OF DOMESTIC RACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the two previous chapters, when discussing reversion and prepotency,\r\nI was necessarily led to give many facts on crossing. In the present\r\nchapter I shall consider the part which crossing plays in two opposed\r\ndirections,—firstly, in obliterating characters, and consequently in\r\npreventing the formation of new races; and secondly, in the\r\nmodification of old races, or in the formation of new and intermediate\r\nraces, by a combination of characters. I shall also show that certain\r\ncharacters are incapable of fusion.\r\n\r\nThe effects of free or uncontrolled breeding between the members of the\r\nsame variety or of closely allied varieties are important; but are so\r\nobvious that they need not be discussed at much length. It is free\r\nintercrossing which chiefly gives uniformity, both under nature and\r\nunder domestication, to the individuals of the same species or variety,\r\nwhen they live mingled together and are not exposed to any cause\r\ninducing excessive variability. The prevention of free crossing, and\r\nthe intentional matching of individual animals, are the corner-stones\r\nof the breeder’s art. No man in his senses would expect to improve or\r\nmodify a breed in any particular manner, or keep an old breed true and\r\ndistinct, unless he separated his animals. The killing of inferior\r\nanimals in each generation comes to the same thing as their separation.\r\nIn savage and semi-civilised countries, where the inhabitants have not\r\nthe means of separating their animals, more than a single breed of the\r\nsame species rarely or never exists. In former times, even in the\r\nUnited States, there were no distinct races of sheep, for all had been\r\nmingled together.[1] The celebrated agriculturist Marshall[2] remarks\r\nthat “sheep that are kept within fences, as well as shepherded flocks\r\nin open countries, have generally a similarity, if not a uniformity, of\r\ncharacter in the individuals of each flock;” for they breed freely\r\ntogether, and are prevented from crossing with other kinds; whereas in\r\nthe unenclosed parts of England the unshepherded sheep, even of the\r\nsame flock, are far from true or uniform, owing to various breeds\r\nhaving mingled and crossed. We have seen that the half-wild cattle in\r\neach of the several British parks are nearly uniform in character; but\r\nin the different parks, from not having mingled and crossed during many\r\ngenerations, they differ to a certain small extent.\r\n\r\nWe cannot doubt that the extraordinary number of varieties and\r\nsub-varieties of the pigeon, amounting to at least one hundred and\r\nfifty, is partly due to their remaining, differently from other\r\ndomesticated birds, paired for life once matched. On the other hand,\r\nbreeds of cats imported into this country soon disappear, for their\r\nnocturnal and rambling habits render it hardly possible to prevent free\r\ncrossing. Rengger[3] gives an interesting case with respect to the cat\r\nin Paraguay: in all the distant parts of the kingdom it has assumed,\r\napparently from the effects of the climate, a peculiar character, but\r\nnear the capital this change has been prevented, owing, as he asserts,\r\nto the native animal frequently crossing with cats imported from\r\nEurope. In all cases like the foregoing, the effects of an occasional\r\ncross will be augmented by the increased vigour and fertility of the\r\ncrossed offspring, of which fact evidence will hereafter be given; for\r\nthis will lead to the mongrels increasing more rapidly than the pure\r\nparent-breeds.\r\n\r\nWhen distinct breeds are allowed to cross freely, the result will be a\r\nheterogeneous body; for instance, the dogs in Paraguay are far from\r\nuniform, and can no longer be affiliated to their parent-races.[4] The\r\ncharacter which a crossed body of animals will ultimately assume must\r\ndepend on several contingencies,—namely, on the relative members of the\r\nindividuals belonging to the two or more races which are allowed to\r\nmingle; on the prepotency of one race over the other in the\r\ntransmission of character; and on the conditions of life to which they\r\nare exposed. When two commingled breeds exist at first in nearly equal\r\nnumbers, the whole will sooner or later become intimately blended, but\r\nnot so soon, both breeds being equally favoured in all respects, as\r\nmight have been expected. The following calculation[5] shows that this\r\nis the case: if a colony with an equal number of black and white men\r\nwere founded, and we assume that they marry indiscriminately, are\r\nequally prolific, and that one in thirty annually dies and is born;\r\nthen “in 65 years the number of blacks, whites, and mulattoes would be\r\nequal. In 91 years the whites would be 1-10th, the blacks 1-10th, and\r\nthe mulattoes, or people of intermediate degrees of colour, 8-10ths of\r\nthe whole number. In three centuries not 1-100th part of the whites\r\nwould exist.”\r\n\r\nWhen one of two mingled races exceed the other greatly in number, the\r\nlatter will soon be wholly, or almost wholly, absorbed and lost.[6]\r\nThus European pigs and dogs have been largely introduced in the islands\r\nof the Pacific Ocean, and the native races have been absorbed and lost\r\nin the course of about fifty or sixty years;[7] but the imported races\r\nno doubt were favoured. Rats may be considered as semi-domesticated\r\nanimals. Some snake-rats (_Mus alexandrinus_) escaped in the Zoological\r\nGardens of London “and for a long time afterwards the keepers\r\nfrequently caught cross-bred rats, at first half-breds, afterwards with\r\nless of the character of the snake-rat, till at length all traces of it\r\ndisappeared.”[8] On the other hand, in some parts of London, especially\r\nnear the docks, where fresh rats are frequently imported, an endless\r\nvariety of intermediate forms may be found between the brown, black,\r\nand snake rat, which are all three usually ranked as distinct species.\r\n\r\nHow many generations are necessary for one species or race to absorb\r\nanother by repeated crosses has often been discussed;[9] and the\r\nrequisite number has probably been much exaggerated. Some writers have\r\nmaintained that a dozen or score, or even more generations, are\r\nnecessary; but this in itself is improbable, for in the tenth\r\ngeneration there would be only 1-1024th part of foreign blood in the\r\noffspring. Gärtner found,[10] that with plants, one species could be\r\nmade to absorb another in from three to five generations, and he\r\nbelieves that this could always be effected in from six to seven\r\ngenerations. In one instance, however, Kolreuter[11] speaks of the\r\noffspring of _Mirabilis vulgaris,_ crossed during eight successive\r\ngenerations by _M. longiflora,_ as resembling this latter species so\r\nclosely, that the most scrupulous observer could detect “vix aliquam\r\nnotabilem differentiam” or, as he says, he succeeded, “ad plenariam\r\nfere transmutationem.” But this expression shows that the act of\r\nabsorption was not even then absolutely complete, though these crossed\r\nplants contained only the 1-256th part of _M. vulgaris._ The\r\nconclusions of such accurate observers as Gärtner and Kölreuter are of\r\nfar higher worth than those made without scientific aim by breeders.\r\nThe most precise account which I have met with is given by\r\nStonehenge[12] and is illustrated by photographs. Mr. Hanley crossed a\r\ngreyhound bitch with a bulldog; the offspring in each succeeding\r\ngeneration being recrossed with first-rate greyhounds. As Stonehenge\r\nremarks, it might naturally be supposed that it would take several\r\ncrosses to get rid of the heavy form of the bulldog; but Hysterics, the\r\ngr-gr-granddaughter of a bulldog, showed no trace whatever of this\r\nbreed in external form. She and all of the same litter, however, were\r\n“remarkably deficient in stoutness, though fast as well as clever.” I\r\nbelieve clever refers to skill in turning. Hysterics was put to a son\r\nof Bedlamite, “but the result of the fifth cross is not as yet, I\r\nbelieve, more satisfactory than that of the fourth.” On the other hand,\r\nwith sheep, Fleischmann[13] shows how persistent the effects of a\r\nsingle cross may be: he says “that the original coarse sheep (of\r\nGermany) have 5500 fibres of wool on a square inch; grades of the third\r\nor fourth Merino cross produced about 8000, the twentieth cross 27,000,\r\nthe perfect pure Merino blood 40,000 to 48,000.” So that common German\r\nsheep crossed twenty times successively with Merino did not by any\r\nmeans acquire wool as fine as that of the pure breed. But in all cases,\r\nthe rate of absorption will depend largely on the conditions of life\r\nbeing favourable to any particular character; and we may suspect that\r\nthere would be a constant tendency to degeneration in the wool of\r\nMerinos under the climate of Germany, unless prevented by careful\r\nselection; and thus perhaps the foregoing remarkable case may be\r\nexplained. The rate of absorption must also depend on the amount of\r\ndistinguishable difference between the two forms which are crossed, and\r\nespecially, as Gärtner insists, on prepotency of transmission in the\r\none form over the other. We have seen in the last chapter that one of\r\ntwo French breeds of sheep yielded up its character, when crossed with\r\nMerinos, very much more slowly than the other; and the common German\r\nsheep referred to by Fleischmann may be in this respect analogous. In\r\nall cases there will be more or less liability to reversion during many\r\nsubsequent generations, and it is this fact which has probably led\r\nauthors to maintain that a score or more of generations are requisite\r\nfor one race to absorb another. In considering the final result of the\r\ncommingling of two or more breeds, we must not forget that the act of\r\ncrossing in itself tends to bring back long-lost characters not proper\r\nto the immediate parent-forms.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the influence of the conditions of life on any two\r\nbreeds which are allowed to cross freely, unless both are indigenous\r\nand have long been accustomed to the country where they live, they\r\nwill, in all probability, be unequally affected by the conditions, and\r\nthis will modify the result. Even with indigenous breeds, it will\r\nrarely or never occur that both are equally well adapted to the\r\nsurrounding circumstances; more especially when permitted to roam\r\nfreely, and not carefully tended, as is generally the case with breeds\r\nallowed to cross. As a consequence of this, natural selection will to a\r\ncertain extent come into action, and the best fitted will survive, and\r\nthis will aid in determining the ultimate character of the commingled\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nHow long a time it would require before such a crossed body of animals\r\nwould assume a uniform character within a limited area, no one can say;\r\nthat they would ultimately become uniform from free intercrossing, and\r\nfrom the survival of the fittest, we may feel assured; but the\r\ncharacters thus acquired would rarely or never, as may be inferred from\r\nthe previous considerations, be exactly intermediate between those of\r\nthe two parent-breeds. With respect to the very slight differences by\r\nwhich the individuals of the same sub-variety, or even of allied\r\nvarieties, are characterised, it is obvious that free crossing would\r\nsoon obliterate such small distinctions. The formation of new\r\nvarieties, independently of selection, would also thus be prevented;\r\nexcept when the same variation continually recurred from the action of\r\nsome strongly predisposing cause. We may therefore conclude that free\r\ncrossing has in all cases played an important part in giving uniformity\r\nof character to all the members of the same domestic race and of the\r\nsame natural species, though largely governed by natural selection and\r\nby the direct action of the surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\n_On the possibility of all organic beings occasionally\r\nintercrossing._—But it may be asked, can free crossing occur with\r\nhermaphrodite animals and plants? All the higher animals, and the few\r\ninsects which have been domesticated, have separate sexes, and must\r\ninevitably unite for each birth. With respect to the crossing of\r\nhermaphrodites, the subject is too large for the present volume, but in\r\nthe ‘Origin of Species’ I have given a short abstract of the reasons\r\nwhich induce me to believe that all organic beings occasionally cross,\r\nthough perhaps in some cases only at long intervals of time.[14] I will\r\nmerely recall the fact that many plants, though hermaphrodite in\r\nstructure, are unisexual in function;—such as those called by C.K.\r\nSprengel _dichogamous,_ in which the pollen and stigma of the same\r\nflower are matured at different periods; or those called by me\r\n_reciprocally dimorphic,_ in which the flower’s own pollen is not\r\nfitted to fertilise its own stigma; or again, the many kinds in which\r\ncurious mechanical contrivances exist, effectually preventing\r\nself-fertilisation. There are, however, many hermaphrodite plants which\r\nare not in any way specially constructed to favour intercrossing, but\r\nwhich nevertheless commingle almost as freely as animals with separated\r\nsexes. This is the case with cabbages, radishes, and onions, as I know\r\nfrom having experimented on them: even the peasants of Liguria say that\r\ncabbages must be prevented “from falling in love” with each other. In\r\nthe orange tribe, Gallesio[15] remarks that the amelioration of the\r\nvarious kinds is checked by their continual and almost regular\r\ncrossing. So it is with numerous other plants.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some cultivated plants rarely or never intercross,\r\nfor instance, the common pea and sweet-pea (_Lathyrus odoratus_); yet\r\ntheir flowers are certainly adapted for cross fertilisation. The\r\nvarieties of the tomato and aubergine (_Solanum_) and the pimenta\r\n(_Pimenta vulgaris?_) are said[16] never to cross, even when growing\r\nalongside one another. But it should be observed that these are all\r\nexotic plants, and we do not know how they would behave in their native\r\ncountry when visited by the proper insects. With respect to the common\r\npea, I have ascertained that it is rarely crossed in this country owing\r\nto premature fertilisation. There exist, however, some plants which\r\nunder their natural conditions appear to be always self-fertilised,\r\nsuch as the Bee Ophrys (_Ophrys apifera_) and a few other Orchids; yet\r\nthese plants exhibit the plainest adaptations for cross-fertilisation.\r\nAgain, some few plants are believed to produce only closed flowers,\r\ncalled cleistogene, which cannot possibly be crossed. This was long\r\nthought to be the case with the _Leersia oryzoides,_[17] but this grass\r\nis now known occasionally to produce perfect flowers, which set seed.\r\n\r\nAlthough some plants, both indigenous and naturalised, rarely or never\r\nproduce flowers, or if they flower never produce seeds, yet no one\r\ndoubts that phanerogamic plants are adapted to produce flowers, and the\r\nflowers to produce seed. When they fail, we believe that such plants\r\nunder different conditions would perform their proper function, or that\r\nthey formerly did so, and will do so again. On analogous grounds, I\r\nbelieve that the flowers in the above specified anomalous cases which\r\ndo not now intercross, either would do so occasionally under different\r\nconditions, or that they formerly did so—the means for affecting this\r\nbeing generally still retained—and will again intercross at some future\r\nperiod, unless indeed they become extinct. On this view alone, many\r\npoints in the structure and action of the reproductive organs in\r\nhermaphrodite plants and animals are intelligible,—for instance, the\r\nfact of the male and female organs never being so completely enclosed\r\nas to render access from without impossible. Hence we may conclude that\r\nthe most important of all the means for giving uniformity to the\r\nindividuals of the same species, namely, the capacity of occasionally\r\nintercrossing, is present, or has been formerly present, with all\r\norganic beings, except, perhaps, some of the lowest.\r\n\r\n_On certain Characters not blending._—When two breeds are crossed their\r\ncharacters usually become intimately fused together; but some\r\ncharacters refuse to blend, and are transmitted in an unmodified state\r\neither from both parents or from one. When grey and white mice are\r\npaired, the young are piebald, or pure white or grey, but not of an\r\nintermediate tint; so it is when white and common collared turtle-doves\r\nare paired. In breeding Game fowls, a great authority, Mr. J. Douglas,\r\nremarks, “I may here state a strange fact: if you cross a black with a\r\nwhite game, you get birds of both breeds of the clearest colour.” Sir\r\nR. Heron crossed during many years white, black, brown, and\r\nfawn-coloured Angora rabbits, and never once got these colours mingled\r\nin the same animal, but often all four colours in the same litter.[18]\r\nFrom cases like these, in which the colours of the two parents are\r\ntransmitted quite separately to the offspring, we have all sorts of\r\ngradations, leading to complete fusion. I will give an instance: a\r\ngentleman with a fair complexion, light hair but dark eyes, married a\r\nlady with dark hair and complexion: their three children have very\r\nlight hair, but on careful search about a dozen black hairs were found\r\nscattered in the midst of the light hair on the heads of all three.\r\n\r\nWhen turnspit dogs and ancon sheep, both of which have dwarfed limbs,\r\nare crossed with common breeds, the offspring are not intermediate in\r\nstructure, but take after either parent. When tailless or hornless\r\nanimals are crossed with perfect animals, it frequently, but by no\r\nmeans invariably, happens that the offspring are either furnished with\r\nthese organs in a perfect state, or are quite destitute of them.\r\nAccording to Rengger, the hairless condition of the Paraguay dog is\r\neither perfectly or not at all transmitted to its mongrel offspring;\r\nbut I have seen one partial exception in a dog of this parentage which\r\nhad part of its skin hairy, and part naked, the parts being distinctly\r\nseparated as in a piebald animal. When Dorking fowls with five toes are\r\ncrossed with other breeds, the chickens often have five toes on one\r\nfoot and four on the other. Some crossed pigs raised by Sir R. Heron\r\nbetween the solid-hoofed and common pig had not all four feet in an\r\nintermediate condition, but two feet were furnished with properly\r\ndivided, and two with united hoofs.\r\n\r\nAnalogous facts have been observed with plants: Major Trevor Clarke\r\ncrossed the little, glabrous-leaved, annual stock (Matthiola), with\r\npollen of a large, red-flowered, rough-leaved, biennial stock, called\r\n_cocardeau_ by the French, and the result was that half the seedlings\r\nhad glabrous and the other half rough leaves, but none had leaves in an\r\nintermediate state. That the glabrous seedlings were the product of the\r\nrough-leaved variety, and not accidentally of the mother-plant’s own\r\npollen, was shown by their tall and strong habit of growth.[19] in the\r\nsucceeding generations raised from the rough-leaved crossed seedlings,\r\nsome glabrous plants appeared, showing that the glabrous character,\r\nthough incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves, was\r\nall the time latent in this family of plants. The numerous plants\r\nformerly referred to, which I raised from reciprocal crosses between\r\nthe peloric and common Antirrhinum, offer a nearly parallel case; for\r\nin the first generation all the plants resembled the common form, and\r\nin the next generation, out of one hundred and thirty-seven plants, two\r\nalone were in an intermediate condition, the others perfectly\r\nresembling either the peloric or common form. Major Trevor Clarke also\r\nfertilised the above-mentioned red-flowered stock with pollen from the\r\npurple Queen stock, and about half the seedlings scarcely differed in\r\nhabit, and not at all in the red colour of the flower, from the\r\nmother-plant, the other half bearing blossoms of a rich purple, closely\r\nlike those of the paternal plant. Gärtner crossed many white and\r\nyellow-flowered species and varieties of Verbascum; and these colours\r\nwere never blended, but the offspring bore either pure white or pure\r\nyellow blossoms; the former in the larger proportion.[20] Dr. Herbert\r\nraised many seedlings, as he informed me, from Swedish turnips crossed\r\nby two other varieties, and these never produced flowers of an\r\nintermediate tint, but always like one of their parents. I fertilised\r\nthe purple sweet-pea (_Lathyrus odoratus_), which has a dark\r\nreddish-purple standard-petal and violet-coloured wings and keel, with\r\npollen of the painted lady sweet-pea, which has a pale cherry-coloured\r\nstandard, and almost white wings and keel; and from the same pod I\r\ntwice raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts; the greater number\r\nresembling the father. So perfect was the resemblance, that I should\r\nhave thought there had been some mistake, if the plants which were at\r\nfirst identical with the paternal variety, namely, the painted-lady,\r\nhad not later in the season produced, as mentioned in a former chapter,\r\nflowers blotched and streaked with dark purple. I raised grandchildren\r\nand great-grandchildren from these crossed plants, and they continued\r\nto resemble the painted-lady, but during later generations became\r\nrather more blotched with purple, yet none reverted completely to the\r\noriginal mother-plant, the purple sweet-pea. The following case is\r\nslightly different, but still shows the same principle: Naudin[21]\r\nraised numerous hybrids between the yellow _Linaria vulgaris_ and the\r\npurple _L. purpurea,_ and during three successive generations the\r\ncolours kept distinct in different parts of the same flower.\r\n\r\nFrom cases such as the foregoing, in which the offspring of the first\r\ngeneration perfectly resemble either parent, we come by a small step to\r\nthose cases in which differently coloured flowers borne on the same\r\nroot resemble both parents, and by another step to those in which the\r\nsame flower or fruit is striped or blotched with the two parental\r\ncolours, or bears a single stripe of the colour or other characteristic\r\nquality of one of the parent-forms. With hybrids and mongrels it\r\nfrequently or even generally happens that one part of the body\r\nresembles more or less closely one parent and another part the other\r\nparent; and here again some resistence to fusion, or, what comes to the\r\nsame thing, some mutual affinity between the organic atoms of the same\r\nnature, apparently comes into play, for otherwise all parts of the body\r\nwould be equally intermediate in character. So again, when the\r\noffspring of hybrids or mongrels, which are themselves nearly\r\nintermediate in character, revert either wholly or by segments to their\r\nancestors, the principle of the affinity of similar, or the repulsion\r\nof dissimilar atoms, must come into action. To this principle, which\r\nseems to be extremely general, we shall recur in the chapter on\r\npangenesis.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, as has been strongly insisted upon by Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire in regard to animals, that the transmission of\r\ncharacters without fusion occurs very rarely when species are crossed;\r\nI know of one exception alone, namely, with the hybrids naturally\r\nproduced between the common and hooded crow (_Corvus corone_ and\r\n_cornix_), which, however, are closely allied species, differing in\r\nnothing except colour. Nor have I met with any well-ascertained cases\r\nof transmission of this kind, even when one form is strongly prepotent\r\nover another, when two races are crossed which have been slowly formed\r\nby man’s selection, and therefore resemble to a certain extent natural\r\nspecies. Such cases as puppies in the same litter closely resembling\r\ntwo distinct breeds, are probably due to superfoetation,—that is, to\r\nthe influence of two fathers. All the characters above enumerated,\r\nwhich are transmitted in a perfect state to some of the offspring and\r\nnot to others,— such as distinct colours, nakedness of skin, smoothness\r\nof leaves, absence of horns or tail, additional toes, pelorism, dwarfed\r\nstructure, etc.,—have all been known to appear suddenly in individual\r\nanimals and plants. From this fact, and from the several slight,\r\naggregated differences which distinguish domestic races and species\r\nfrom one another, not being liable to this peculiar form of\r\ntransmission, we may conclude that it is in some way connected with the\r\nsudden appearance of the characters in question.\r\n\r\n_On the Modification of old Races and the Formation of new Races by\r\nCrossing._—We have hitherto chiefly considered the effects of crossing\r\nin giving uniformity of character; we must now look to an opposite\r\nresult. There can be no doubt that crossing, with the aid of rigorous\r\nselection during several generations, has been a potent means in\r\nmodifying old races, and in forming new ones. Lord Orford crossed his\r\nfamous stud of greyhounds once with the bulldog, in order to give them\r\ncourage and perseverance. Certain pointers have been crossed, as I hear\r\nfrom the Rev. W. D. Fox, with the foxhound, to give them dash and\r\nspeed. Certain strains of Dorking fowls have had a slight infusion of\r\nGame blood; and I have known a great fancier who on a single occasion\r\ncrossed his turbit-pigeons with barbs, for the sake of gaining greater\r\nbreadth of beak.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases breeds have been crossed once, for the sake of\r\nmodifying some particular character; but with most of the improved\r\nraces of the pig, which now breed true, there have been repeated\r\ncrosses,—for instance, the improved Essex owes its excellence to\r\nrepeated crosses with the Neapolitan, together probably with some\r\ninfusion of Chinese blood.[22] So with our British sheep: almost all\r\nthe races, except the Southdown, have been largely crossed; “this, in\r\nfact, has been the history of our principal breeds.”[23] To give an\r\nexample, the “Oxfordshire Downs” now rank as an established breed.[24]\r\nThey were produced about the year 1830 by crossing “Hampshire and in\r\nsome instances Southdown ewes with Cotswold rams:” now the Hampshire\r\nram was itself produced by repeated crosses between the native\r\nHampshire sheep and Southdowns; and the long-woolled Cotswold were\r\nimproved by crosses with the Leicester, which latter again is believed\r\nto have been a cross between several long-woolled sheep. Mr. Spooner,\r\nafter considering the various cases which have been carefully recorded,\r\nconcludes, “that from a judicious pairing of cross-bred animals it is\r\npracticable to establish a new breed.” On the continent the history of\r\nseveral crossed races of cattle and of other animals has been well\r\nascertained. To give one instance: the King of Wurtemburg, after\r\ntwenty-five years’ careful breeding, that is, after six or seven\r\ngenerations, made a new breed of cattle from a cross between a Dutch\r\nand a Swiss breed, combined with other breeds.[25] The Sebright bantam,\r\nwhich breeds as true as any other kind of fowl, was formed about sixty\r\nyears ago by a complicated cross.[26] Dark Brahmas, which are believed\r\nby some fanciers to constitute a distinct species, were undoubtedly\r\nformed[27] in the United States, within a recent period, by a cross\r\nbetween Chittagongs and Cochins. With plants there is little doubt that\r\nthe Swede-turnip originated from a cross; and the history of a variety\r\nof wheat, raised from two very distinct varieties, and which after six\r\nyears’ culture presented an even sample, has been recorded on good\r\nauthority.[28]\r\n\r\nUntil lately, cautious and experienced breeders, though not averse to a\r\nsingle infusion of foreign blood, were almost universally convinced\r\nthat the attempt to establish a new race, intermediate between two\r\nwidely distinct races, was hopeless “they clung with superstitious\r\ntenacity to the doctrine of purity of blood, believing it to be the ark\r\nin which alone true safety could be found.”[29] Nor was this conviction\r\nunreasonable: when two distinct races are crossed, the offspring of the\r\nfirst generation are generally nearly uniform in character; but even\r\nthis sometimes fails to be the case, especially with crossed dogs and\r\nfowls, the young of which from the first are sometimes much\r\ndiversified. As cross-bred animals are generally of large size and\r\nvigorous, they have been raised in great numbers for immediate\r\nconsumption. But for breeding they are found utterly useless; for\r\nthough they may themselves be uniform in character, they yield during\r\nmany generations astonishingly diversified offspring. The breeder is\r\ndriven to despair, and concludes that he will never form an\r\nintermediate race. But from the cases already given, and from others\r\nwhich have been recorded, it appears that patience alone is necessary;\r\nas Mr. Spooner remarks, “nature opposes no barrier to successful\r\nadmixture; in the course of time, by the aid of selection and careful\r\nweeding, it is practicable to establish a new breed.” After six or\r\nseven generations the hoped-for result will in most cases be obtained;\r\nbut even then an occasional reversion, or failure to keep true, may be\r\nexpected. The attempt, however, will assuredly fail if the conditions\r\nof life be decidedly unfavourable to the characters of either\r\nparent-breed.[30]\r\n\r\nAlthough the grandchildren and succeeding generations of cross-bred\r\nanimals are generally variable in an extreme degree, some curious\r\nexceptions to the rule have been observed both with crossed races and\r\nspecies. Thus Boitard and Corbié[31] assert that from a Pouter and a\r\nRunt “a Cavalier will appear, which we have classed amongst pigeons of\r\npure race, because it transmits all its qualities to its posterity.”\r\nThe editor of the ‘Poultry Chronicle’[32] bred some bluish fowls from a\r\nblack Spanish cock and a Malay hen; and these remained true to colour\r\n“generation after generation.” The Himalayan breed of rabbits was\r\ncertainly formed by crossing two sub-varieties of the silver-grey\r\nrabbit; although it suddenly assumed its present character, which\r\ndiffers much from that of either parent-breed, yet it has ever since\r\nbeen easily and truly propagated. I crossed some Labrador and Penguin\r\nducks, and recrossed the mongrels with Penguins; afterwards most of the\r\nducks reared during three generations were nearly uniform in character,\r\nbeing brown with a white crescentic mark on the lower part of the\r\nbreast, and with some white spots at the base of the beak; so that by\r\nthe aid of a little selection a new breed might easily have been\r\nformed. With regard to crossed varieties of plants, Mr. Beaton[33]\r\nremarks that “Melville’s extraordinary cross between the Scotch kale\r\nand an early cabbage is as true and genuine as any on record;” but in\r\nthis case no doubt selection was practised. Gärtner[34] has given five\r\ncases of hybrids, in which the progeny kept constant; and hybrids\r\nbetween _Dianthus armeria_ and _deltoides_ remained true and uniform to\r\nthe tenth generation. Dr. Herbert likewise showed me a hybrid from two\r\nspecies of Loasa which from its first production had kept constant\r\nduring several generations.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the first chapter, that the several kinds of dogs are\r\nalmost certainly descended from more than one species, and so it is\r\nwith cattle, pigs and some other domesticated animals. Hence the\r\ncrossing of aboriginally distinct species probably came into play at an\r\nearly period in the formation of our present races. From Rutimeyer’s\r\nobservations there can be little doubt that this occurred with cattle;\r\nbut in most cases one form will probably have absorbed and obliterated\r\nthe other, for it is not likely that semi-civilised men would have\r\ntaken the necessary pains to modify by selection their commingled,\r\ncrossed, and fluctuating stock. Nevertheless, those animals which were\r\nbest adapted to their conditions of life would have survived through\r\nnatural selection; and by this means crossing will often have\r\nindirectly aided in the formation of primeval domesticated breeds.\r\nWithin recent times, as far as animals are concerned, the crossing of\r\ndistinct species has done little or nothing towards the formation or\r\nmodification of our races. It is not yet known whether the several\r\nspecies of silk-moth which have been recently crossed in France will\r\nyield permanent races. With plants which can be multiplied by buds and\r\ncuttings, hybridisation has done wonders, as with many kinds of Roses,\r\nRhododendrons, Pelargoniums, Calceolarias, and Petunias. Nearly all\r\nthese plants can be propagated by seed, most of them freely; but\r\nextremely few or none come true by seed.\r\n\r\nSome authors believe that crossing is the chief cause of\r\nvariability,—that is, of the appearance of absolutely new characters.\r\nSome have gone so far as to look at it as the sole cause; but this\r\nconclusion is disproved by the facts given in the chapter on\r\nBud-variation. The belief that characters not present in either parent\r\nor in their ancestors frequently originate from crossing is doubtful;\r\nthat they occasionally do so is probable; but this subject will be more\r\nconveniently discussed in a future chapter on the causes of\r\nVariability.\r\n\r\nA condensed summary of this and of the three following chapters,\r\ntogether with some remarks on Hybridism, will be given in the\r\nnineteenth chapter.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Communications to the Board of Agriculture,’ vol. i. p. 367.\r\n\r\n [2] ‘Review of Reports, North of England,’ 1808, p. 200.\r\n\r\n [3] ‘Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ 1830, s. 212.\r\n\r\n [4] Rengger, ‘Säugethiere,’ etc., s. 154.\r\n\r\n [5] White, ‘Regular Gradation in Man,’ p. 146.\r\n\r\n [6] Dr. W.

CAUSES WHICH INTERFERE WITH THE FREE CROSSING OF\r\nVARIETIES—INFLUENCE OF DOMESTICATION ON FERTILITY.\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES IN JUDGING OF THE FERTILITY OF VARIETIES WHEN CROSSED.\r\nVARIOUS CAUSES WHICH KEEP VARIETIES DISTINCT, AS THE PERIOD OF BREEDING\r\nAND SEXUAL PREFERENCE—VARIETIES OF WHEAT SAID TO BE STERILE WHEN\r\nCROSSED—VARIETIES OF MAIZE, VERBASCUM, HOLLYHOCK, GOURDS, MELONS, AND\r\nTOBACCO, RENDERED IN SOME DEGREE MUTUALLY STERILE—DOMESTICATION\r\nELIMINATES THE TENDENCY TO STERILITY NATURAL TO SPECIES WHEN CROSSED—ON\r\nTHE INCREASED FERTILITY OF UNCROSSED ANIMALS AND PLANTS FROM\r\nDOMESTICATION AND CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe domesticated races of both animals and plants, when crossed, are,\r\nwith extremely few exceptions, quite prolific,—in some cases even more\r\nso than the purely-bred parent-races. The offspring, also, raised from\r\nsuch crosses are likewise, as we shall see in the following chapter,\r\ngenerally more vigorous and fertile than their parents. On the other\r\nhand, species when crossed, and their hybrid offspring, are almost\r\ninvariably in some degree sterile; and here there seems to exist a\r\nbroad and insuperable distinction between races and species. The\r\nimportance of this subject as bearing on the origin of species is\r\nobvious; and we shall hereafter recur to it.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate how few precise observations have been made on the\r\nfertility of mongrel animals and plants during several successive\r\ngenerations. Dr. Broca[1] has remarked that no one has observed\r\nwhether, for instance, mongrel dogs, bred inter se, are indefinitely\r\nfertile; yet, if a shade of infertility be detected by careful\r\nobservation in the offspring of natural forms when crossed, it is\r\nthought that their specific distinction is proved. But so many breeds\r\nof sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, and poultry, have been crossed and\r\nrecrossed in various ways, that any sterility, if it had existed, would\r\nfrom being injurious almost certainly have been observed. In\r\ninvestigating the fertility of crossed varieties many sources of doubt\r\noccur. Whenever the least trace of sterility between two plants,\r\nhowever closely allied, was observed by Kolreuter, and more especially\r\nby Gärtner, who counted the exact number of seed in each capsule, the\r\ntwo forms were at once ranked as distinct species; and if this rule be\r\nfollowed, assuredly it will never be proved that varieties when crossed\r\nare in any degree sterile. We have formerly seen that certain breeds of\r\ndogs do not readily pair together; but no observations have been made\r\nwhether, when paired, they produce the full number of young, and\r\nwhether the latter are perfectly fertile _inter se_; but, supposing\r\nthat some degree of sterility were found to exist, naturalists would\r\nsimply infer that these breeds were descended from aboriginally\r\ndistinct species; and it would be scarcely possible to ascertain\r\nwhether or not this explanation was the true one.\r\n\r\nThe Sebright Bantam is much less prolific than any other breed of\r\nfowls, and is descended from a cross between two very distinct breeds,\r\nrecrossed by a third sub-variety. But it would be extremely rash to\r\ninfer that the loss of fertility was in any manner connected with its\r\ncrossed origin, for it may with more probability be attributed either\r\nto long-continued close interbreeding, or to an innate tendency to\r\nsterility correlated with the absence of hackles and sickle\r\ntail-feathers.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the few recorded cases of forms, which must be ranked as\r\nvarieties, being in some degree sterile when crossed, I may remark that\r\nother causes sometimes interfere with varieties freely intercrossing.\r\nThus they may differ too greatly in size, as with some kinds of dogs\r\nand fowls: for instance, the editor of the ‘Journal of Horticulture,\r\netc.’[2] says that he can keep Bantams with the larger breeds without\r\nmuch danger of their crossing, but not with the smaller breeds, such as\r\nGames, Hamburghs, etc. With plants a difference in the period of\r\nflowering serves to keep varieties distinct, as with the various kinds\r\nof maize and wheat: thus Colonel Le Couteur[3] remarks, “the Talavera\r\nwheat, from flowering much earlier than any other kind, is sure to\r\ncontinue pure.” In different parts of the Falkland Islands the cattle\r\nare breaking up into herds of different colours; and those on the\r\nhigher ground, which are generally white, usually breed, as I am\r\ninformed by Sir J. Sulivan, three months earlier than those on the\r\nlowland; and this would manifestly tend to keep the herds from\r\nblending.\r\n\r\nCertain domestic races seem to prefer breeding with their own kind; and\r\nthis is a fact of some importance, for it is a step towards that\r\ninstinctive feeling which helps to keep closely allied species in a\r\nstate of nature distinct. We have now abundant evidence that, if it\r\nwere not for this feeling, many more hybrids would be naturally\r\nproduced than in this case. We have seen in the first chapter that the\r\nalco dog of Mexico dislikes dogs of other breeds; and the hairless dog\r\nof Paraguay mixes less readily with the European races, than the latter\r\ndo with each other. In Germany the female Spitz-dog is said to receive\r\nthe fox more readily than will other dogs; a female Australian Dingo in\r\nEngland attracted the wild male foxes. But these differences in the\r\nsexual instinct and attractive power of the various breeds may be\r\nwholly due to their descent from distinct species. In Paraguay the\r\nhorses have much freedom, and an excellent observer[4] believes that\r\nthe native horses of the same colour and size prefer associating with\r\neach other, and that the horses which have been imported from Entre\r\nRios and Banda Oriental into Paraguay likewise prefer associating\r\ntogether. In Circassia six sub-races of the horse have received\r\ndistinct names; and a native proprietor of rank[5] asserts that horses\r\nof three of these races, whilst living a free life, almost always\r\nrefuse to mingle and cross, and will even attack one another.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, in a district stocked with heavy Lincolnshire and\r\nlight Norfolk sheep, that both kinds; though bred together, when turned\r\nout, “in a short time separate to a sheep;” the Lincolnshires drawing\r\noff to the rich soil, and the Norfolks to their own dry light soil; and\r\nas long as there is plenty of grass, “the two breeds keep themselves as\r\ndistinct as rooks and pigeons.” In this case different habits of life\r\ntend to keep the races distinct. On one of the Faroe islands, not more\r\nthan half a mile in diameter, the half-wild native black sheep are said\r\nnot to have readily mixed with the imported white sheep. It is a more\r\ncurious fact that the semi-monstrous ancon sheep of modern origin “have\r\nbeen observed to keep together, separating themselves from the rest of\r\nthe flock, when put into enclosures with other sheep.”[6] With respect\r\nto fallow-deer, which live in a semi-domesticated condition, Mr.\r\nBennett[7] states that the dark and pale coloured herds, which have\r\nlong been kept together in the Forest of Dean, in High Meadow Woods,\r\nand in the New Forest, have never been known to mingle: the\r\ndark-coloured deer, it may be added, are believed to have been first\r\nbrought by James I. from Norway, on account of their greater hardiness.\r\nI imported from the island of Porto Santo two of the feral rabbits,\r\nwhich differ, as described in the fourth chapter, from common rabbits;\r\nboth proved to be males, and, though they lived during some years in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, the superintendent, Mr. Bartlett, in vain\r\nendeavoured to make them breed with various tame kinds; but whether\r\nthis refusal to breed was due to any change in the instinct, or simply\r\nto their extreme wildness, or whether confinement had rendered them\r\nsterile, as often occurs, cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nWhilst matching for the sake of experiment many of the most distinct\r\nbreeds of pigeons, it frequently appeared to me that the birds, though\r\nfaithful to their marriage vow, retained some desire after their own\r\nkind. Accordingly I asked Mr. Wicking, who has kept a larger stock of\r\nvarious breeds together than any man in England, whether he thought\r\nthat they would prefer pairing with their own kind, supposing that\r\nthere were males and females enough of each; and he without hesitation\r\nanswered that he was convinced that this was the case. It has often\r\nbeen noticed that the dovecote pigeon seems to have an actual aversion\r\ntowards the several fancy breeds[8] yet all have certainly sprung from\r\na common progenitor. The Rev. W. D. Fox informs me that his flocks of\r\nwhite and common Chinese geese kept distinct.\r\n\r\nThese facts and statements, though some of them are incapable of proof,\r\nresting only on the opinion of experienced observers, show that some\r\ndomestic races are led by different habits of life to keep to a certain\r\nextent separate, and that others prefer coupling with their own kind,\r\nin the same manner as species in a state of nature, though in a much\r\nless degree.\r\n\r\nWith respect to sterility from the crossing of domestic races, I know\r\nof no well-ascertained case with animals. This fact, seeing the great\r\ndifference in structure between some breeds of pigeons, fowls, pigs,\r\ndogs, etc., is extraordinary, in contrast with the sterility of many\r\nclosely allied natural species when crossed; but we shall hereafter\r\nattempt to show that it is not so extraordinary as it at first appears.\r\nAnd it may be well here to recall to mind that the amount of external\r\ndifference between two species is not a safe guide for predicting\r\nwhether or not they will breed together,—some closely allied species\r\nwhen crossed being utterly sterile, and others which are extremely\r\nunlike being moderately fertile. I have said that no case of sterility\r\nin crossed races rests on satisfactory evidence; but here is one which\r\nat first seems trustworthy. Mr. Youatt[9] and a better authority cannot\r\nbe quoted, states, that formerly in Lancashire crosses were frequently\r\nmade between longhorn and shorthorn cattle; the first cross was\r\nexcellent, but the produce was uncertain; in the third or fourth\r\ngeneration the cows were bad milkers; “in addition to which, there was\r\nmuch uncertainty whether the cows would conceive; and full one-third of\r\nthe cows among some of these half-breds failed to be in calf.” This at\r\nfirst seems a good case: but Mr. Wilkinson states,[10] that a breed\r\nderived from this same cross was actually established in another part\r\nof England; and if it had failed in fertility, the fact would surely\r\nhave been noticed. Moreover, supposing that Mr. Youatt had proved his\r\ncase, it might be argued that the sterility was wholly due to the two\r\nparent-breeds being descended from primordially distinct species.\r\n\r\nIn the case of plants Gärtner states that he fertilised thirteen heads\r\n(and subsequently nine others) on a dwarf maize bearing yellow seed[11]\r\nwith pollen of a tall maize having red seed; and one head alone\r\nproduced good seed, but only five in number. Though these plants are\r\nmonœcious, and therefore do not require castration, yet I should have\r\nsuspected some accident in the manipulation, had not Gärtner expressly\r\nstated that he had during many years grown these two varieties\r\ntogether, and they did not spontaneously cross; and this, considering\r\nthat the plants are monoecious and abound with pollen, and are well\r\nknown generally to cross freely, seems explicable only on the belief\r\nthat these two varieties are in some degree mutually infertile. The\r\nhybrid plants raised from the above five seeds were intermediate in\r\nstructure, extremely variable, and perfectly fertile.[12] In like\r\nmanner Prof. Hildebrand[13] could not succeed in fertilising the female\r\nflowers of a plant bearing brown grains with pollen from a certain kind\r\nbearing yellow grains; although other flowers on the same plant, which\r\nwere fertilised with their own pollen, yielded good seed. No one, I\r\nbelieve, even suspects that these varieties of maize are distinct\r\nspecies; but had the hybrids been in the least sterile, no doubt\r\nGärtner would at once have so classed them. I may here remark, that\r\nwith undoubted species there is not necessarily any close relation\r\nbetween the sterility of a first cross and that of the hybrid\r\noffspring. Some species can be crossed with facility, but produce\r\nutterly sterile hybrids; others can be crossed with extreme difficulty,\r\nbut the hybrids when produced are moderately fertile. I am not aware,\r\nhowever, of any instance quite like this of the maize, namely, of a\r\nfirst cross made with difficulty, but yielding perfectly fertile\r\nhybrids.[14]\r\n\r\nThe following case is much more remarkable, and evidently perplexed\r\nGärtner, whose strong wish it was to draw a broad line of distinction\r\nbetween species and varieties. In the genus Verbascum, he made, during\r\neighteen years, a vast number of experiments, and crossed no less than\r\n1085 flowers and counted their seeds. Many of these experiments\r\nconsisted in crossing white and yellow varieties of both _V. lychnitis_\r\nand _V. blattaria_ with nine other species and their hybrids. That the\r\nwhite and yellow flowered plants of these two species are really\r\nvarieties, no one has doubted; and Gärtner actually raised in the case\r\nof both species one variety from the seed of the other. Now in two of\r\nhis works[15] he distinctly asserts that crosses between\r\nsimilarly-coloured flowers yield more seed than between\r\ndissimilarly-coloured; so that the yellow-flowered variety of either\r\nspecies (and conversely with the white-flowered variety), when crossed\r\nwith pollen of its own kind, yields more seed than when crossed with\r\nthat of the white variety; and so it is when differently coloured\r\nspecies are crossed. The general results may be seen in the Table at\r\nthe end of his volume. In one instance he gives[16] the following\r\ndetails; but I must premise that Gärtner, to avoid exaggerating the\r\ndegree of sterility in his crosses, always compares the _maximum_\r\nnumber obtained from a cross with the _average_ number naturally given\r\nby the pure mother-plant. The white variety of _V. lychnitis,_\r\nnaturally fertilised by its own pollen, gave from an _average_ of\r\ntwelve capsules ninety-six good seeds in each; whilst twenty flowers\r\nfertilised with pollen from the yellow variety of this same species,\r\ngave as the _maximum_ only eighty-nine good seeds; so that we have the\r\nproportion of 1000 to 908, according to Gärtner’s usual scale. I should\r\nhave thought it possible that so small a difference in fertility might\r\nhave been accounted for by the evil effects of the necessary\r\ncastration; but Gärtner shows that the white variety of _V. lychnitis,_\r\nwhen fertilised first by the white variety of _V. blattaria,_ and then\r\nby the yellow variety of this species, yielded seed in the proportion\r\nof 622 to 438; and in both these cases castration was performed. Now\r\nthe sterility which results from the crossing of the differently\r\ncoloured varieties of the same species, is fully as great as that which\r\noccurs in many cases when distinct species are crossed. Unfortunately\r\nGärtner compared the results of the first unions alone, and not the\r\nsterility of the two sets of hybrids produced from the white variety of\r\n_V. lychnitis_ when fertilised by the white and yellow varieties of _V.\r\nblattaria,_ for it is probable that they would have differed in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Scott has given me the results of a series of experiments on\r\nVerbascum, made by him in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh.[17] He\r\nrepeated some of Gärtner’s experiments on distinct species, but\r\nobtained only fluctuating results, some confirmatory, the greater\r\nnumber contradictory; nevertheless these seem hardly sufficient to\r\noverthrow the conclusion arrived at by Gärtner from experiments tried\r\non a larger scale. Mr. Scott also experimented on the relative\r\nfertility of unions between similarly and dissimilarly-coloured\r\nvarieties of the same species. Thus he fertilised six flowers of the\r\nyellow variety of _V. lychnitis_ by its own pollen, and obtained six\r\ncapsules; and calling, for the sake of comparison, the average number\r\nof good seed in each of their capsules one hundred, he found that this\r\nsame yellow variety, when fertilised by the white variety, yielded from\r\nseven capsules an average of ninety-four seed. On the same principle,\r\nthe white variety of _V. lychnitis_ by its own pollen (from six\r\ncapsules), and by the pollen of the yellow variety (eight capsules),\r\nyielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 82. The yellow variety of _V.\r\nthapsus_ by its own pollen (eight capsules), and by that of the white\r\nvariety (only two capsules), yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to\r\n94. Lastly, the white variety of _V. blattaria_ by its own pollen\r\n(eight capsules), and by that of the yellow variety (five capsules),\r\nyielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 79. So that in every case the\r\nunions of similarly-coloured varieties of the same species were more\r\nfertile than the unions of dissimilarly-coloured varieties; when all\r\nthe cases are grouped together, the difference of fertility is as 100\r\nto 86. Some additional trials were made, and altogether thirty-six\r\nsimilarly-coloured unions yielded thirty-five good capsules; whilst\r\nthirty-five dissimilarly-coloured unions yielded only twenty-six good\r\ncapsules. Besides the foregoing experiments, the purple _V. phœniceum_\r\nwas crossed by a rose-coloured and a white variety of the same species;\r\nthese two varieties were also crossed together, and these several\r\nunions yielded less seed than _V. phœniceum_ by its own pollen. Hence\r\nit follows from Mr. Scott’s experiments, that in the genus Verbascum\r\nthe similarly and dissimilarly-coloured varieties of the same species\r\nbehave, when crossed, like closely allied but distinct species.[18]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable fact of the sexual affinity of similarly-coloured\r\nvarieties, as observed by Gärtner and Mr. Scott, may not be of very\r\nrare occurrence; for the subject has not been attended to by others.\r\nThe following case is worth giving, partly to show how difficult it is\r\nto avoid error. Dr. Herbert[19] has remarked that variously-coloured\r\ndouble varieties of the Hollyhock (_Althea rosea_) may be raised with\r\ncertainty by seed from plants growing close together. I have been\r\ninformed that nurserymen who raise seed for sale do not separate their\r\nplants; accordingly I procured seed of eighteen named varieties; of\r\nthese, eleven varieties produced sixty-two plants all perfectly true to\r\ntheir kind; and seven produced forty-nine plants, half of which were\r\ntrue and half false. Mr. Masters of Canterbury has given me a more\r\nstriking case; he saved seed from a great bed of twenty-four named\r\nvarieties planted in closely adjoining rows, and each variety\r\nreproduced itself truly with only sometimes a shade of difference in\r\ntint. Now in the hollyhock the pollen, which is abundant, is matured\r\nand nearly all shed before the stigma of the same flower is ready to\r\nreceive it;[20] and as bees covered with pollen incessantly fly from\r\nplant to plant, it would appear that adjoining varieties could not\r\nescape being crossed. As, however, this does not occur, it appeared to\r\nme probable that the pollen of each variety was prepotent on its own\r\nstigma over that of all other varieties, but I have no evidence on this\r\npoint. Mr. C. Turner of Slough, well known for his success in the\r\ncultivation of this plant, informs me that it is the doubleness of the\r\nflowers which prevents the bees gaining access to the pollen and\r\nstigma; and he finds that it is difficult even to cross them\r\nartificially. Whether this explanation will fully account for varieties\r\nin close proximity propagating themselves so truly by seed, I do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are worth giving, as they relate to monoecious\r\nforms, which do not require, and consequently cannot have been injured\r\nby, castration. Girou de Buzareingues crossed what he designates three\r\nvarieties of gourd,[21] and asserts that their mutual fertilisation is\r\nless easy in proportion to the difference which they present. I am\r\naware how imperfectly the forms in this group were until recently\r\nknown; but Sageret,[22] who ranked them according to their mutual\r\nfertility, considers the three forms above alluded to as varieties, as\r\ndoes a far higher authority, namely, M. Naudin.[23] Sageret[24] has\r\nobserved that certain melons have a greater tendency, whatever the\r\ncause may be, to keep true than others; and M. Naudin, who has had such\r\nimmense experience in this group, informs me that he believes that\r\ncertain varieties intercross more readily than others of the same\r\nspecies; but he has not proved the truth of this conclusion; the\r\nfrequent abortion of the pollen near Paris being one great difficulty.\r\nNevertheless, he has grown close together, during seven years, certain\r\nforms of Citrullus, which, as they could be artificially crossed with\r\nperfect facility and produced fertile offspring, are ranked as\r\nvarieties; but these forms when not artificially crossed kept true.\r\nMany other varieties, on the other hand, in the same group cross with\r\nsuch facility, as M. Naudin repeatedly insists, that without being\r\ngrown far apart they cannot be kept in the least true.\r\n\r\nAnother case, though somewhat different, may be here given, as it is\r\nhighly remarkable, and is established on excellent evidence. Kolreuter\r\nminutely describes five varieties of the common tobacco[25] which were\r\nreciprocally crossed, and the offspring were intermediate in character\r\nand as fertile as their parents: from this fact Kolreuter inferred that\r\nthey are really varieties; and no one, as far as I can discover, seems\r\nto have doubted that such is the case. He also crossed reciprocally\r\nthese five varieties with _N. glutinosa,_ and they yielded very sterile\r\nhybrids; but those raised from the _var. perennis,_ whether used as the\r\nfather or mother plant, were not so sterile as the hybrids from the\r\nfour other varieties.[26] So that the sexual capacity of this one\r\nvariety has certainly been in some degree modified, so as to approach\r\nin nature that of _N. glutinosa._[27]\r\n\r\nThese facts with respect to plants show that in some few cases certain\r\nvarieties have had their sexual powers so far modified, that they cross\r\ntogether less readily and yield less seed than other varieties of the\r\nsame species. We shall presently see that the sexual functions of most\r\nanimals and plants are eminently liable to be affected by the\r\nconditions of life to which they are exposed; and hereafter we shall\r\nbriefly discuss the conjoint bearing of this fact, and others, on the\r\ndifference in fertility between crossed varieties and crossed species.\r\n\r\n      _Domestication eliminates the tendency to Sterility which is\r\n      general with Species when crossed._\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis was first propounded by Pallas,[28] and has been\r\nadopted by several authors. I can find hardly any direct facts in its\r\nsupport; but unfortunately no one has compared, in the case of either\r\nanimals or plants, the fertility of anciently domesticated varieties,\r\nwhen crossed with a distinct species, with that of the wild\r\nparent-species when similarly crossed. No one has compared, for\r\ninstance, the fertility of _Gallus bankiva_ and of the domesticated\r\nfowl, when crossed with a distinct species of Gallus or Phasianus; and\r\nthe experiment would in all cases be surrounded by many difficulties.\r\nDureau de la Malle, who has so closely studied classical literature,\r\nstates[29] that in the time of the Romans the common mule was produced\r\nwith more difficulty than at the present day; but whether this\r\nstatement may be trusted I know not. A much more important, though\r\nsomewhat different, case is given by M. Groenland,[30] namely, that\r\nplants, known from their intermediate character and sterility to be\r\nhybrids between Ægilops and wheat, have perpetuated themselves under\r\nculture since 1857, _with a rapid but varying increase of fertility in\r\neach generation._ In the fourth generation the plants, still retaining\r\ntheir intermediate character, had become as fertile as common\r\ncultivated wheat.\r\n\r\nThe indirect evidence in favour of the Pallasian doctrine appears to me\r\nto be extremely strong. In the earlier chapters I have shown that our\r\nvarious breeds of the dog are descended from several wild species; and\r\nthis probably is the case with sheep. There can be no doubt that the\r\nZebu or humped Indian ox belongs to a distinct species from European\r\ncattle: the latter, moreover, are descended from two forms, which may\r\nbe called either species or races. We have good evidence that our\r\ndomesticated pigs belong to at least two specific types, _S. scrofa_\r\nand _ indicus._ Now a widely extended analogy leads to the belief that\r\nif these several allied species, when first reclaimed, had been\r\ncrossed, they would have exhibited, both in their first unions and in\r\ntheir hybrid offspring, some degree of sterility. Nevertheless, the\r\nseveral domesticated races descended from them are now all, as far as\r\ncan be ascertained, perfectly fertile together. If this reasoning be\r\ntrustworthy, and it is apparently sound, we must admit the Pallasian\r\ndoctrine that long-continued domestication tends to eliminate that\r\nsterility which is natural to species when crossed in their aboriginal\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n      _On increased Fertility from Domestication and Cultivation._\r\n\r\nIncreased fertility from domestication, without any reference to\r\ncrossing, may be here briefly considered. This subject bears indirectly\r\non two or three points connected with the modification of organic\r\nbeings. As Buffon long ago remarked,[31] domestic animals breed oftener\r\nin the year and produce more young at a birth than wild animals of the\r\nsame species; they, also, sometimes breed at an earlier age. The case\r\nwould hardly have deserved further notice, had not some authors lately\r\nattempted to show that fertility increases and decreases in an inverse\r\nratio with the amount of food. This strange doctrine has apparently\r\narisen from individual animals when supplied with an inordinate\r\nquantity of food, and from plants of many kinds when grown on\r\nexcessively rich soil, as on a dunghill, becoming sterile: but to this\r\nlatter point I shall have occasion presently to return. With hardly an\r\nexception, our domesticated animals, which have been long habituated to\r\na regular and copious supply of food, without the labour of searching\r\nfor it, are more fertile than the corresponding wild animals. It is\r\nnotorious how frequently cats and dogs breed, and how many young they\r\nproduce at a birth. The wild rabbit is said generally to breed four\r\ntimes yearly, and to produce each time at most six young; the tame\r\nrabbit breeds six or seven times yearly, producing each time from four\r\nto eleven young; and Mr. Harrison Weir tells me of a case of eighteen\r\nyoung having been produced at a birth, all of which survived. The\r\nferret, though generally so closely confined, is more prolific than its\r\nsupposed wild prototype. The wild sow is remarkably prolific; she often\r\nbreeds twice in the year, and bears from four to eight and sometimes\r\neven twelve young; but the domestic sow regularly breeds twice a year,\r\nand would breed oftener if permitted; and a sow that produces less than\r\neight at a birth “is worth little, and the sooner she is fattened for\r\nthe butcher the better.” The amount of food affects the fertility of\r\nthe same individual: thus sheep, which on mountains never produce more\r\nthan one lamb at a birth, when brought down to lowland pastures\r\nfrequently bear twins. This difference apparently is not due to the\r\ncold of the higher land, for sheep and other domestic animals are said\r\nto be extremely prolific in Lapland. Hard living, also, retards the\r\nperiod at which animals conceive; for it has been found disadvantageous\r\nin the northern islands of Scotland to allow cows to bear calves before\r\nthey are four years old.[32]\r\n\r\nBirds offer still better evidence of increased fertility from\r\ndomestication: the hen of the wild _ Gallus bankiva_ lays from six to\r\nten eggs, a number which would be thought nothing of with the domestic\r\nhen. The wild duck lays from five to ten eggs; the tame one in the\r\ncourse of the year from eighty to one hundred. The wild grey-lag goose\r\nlays from five to eight eggs; the tame from thirteen to eighteen, and\r\nshe lays a second time; as Mr. Dixon has remarked, “high-feeding, care,\r\nand moderate warmth induce a habit of prolificacy which becomes in some\r\nmeasure hereditary.” Whether the semi-domesticated dovecote pigeon is\r\nmore fertile than the wild rock-pigeon, C. livia, I know not; but the\r\nmore thoroughly domesticated breeds are nearly twice as fertile as\r\ndovecotes: the latter, however, when caged and highly fed, become\r\nequally fertile with house pigeons. I hear from Judge Caton that the\r\nwild turkey in the United States does not breed when a year old, as the\r\ndomesticated turkeys there invariably do. The peahen alone of\r\ndomesticated birds is rather more fertile, according to some accounts,\r\nwhen wild in its native Indian home, than in Europe when exposed to our\r\nmuch colder climate.[33]\r\n\r\nWith respect to plants, no one would expect wheat to tiller more, and\r\neach ear to produce more grain, in poor than in rich soil; or to get in\r\npoor soil a heavy crop of peas or beans. Seeds vary so much in number\r\nthat it is difficult to estimate them; but on comparing beds of carrots\r\nin a nursery garden with wild plants, the former seemed to produce\r\nabout twice as much seed. Cultivated cabbages yielded thrice as many\r\npods by measure as wild cabbages from the rocks of South Wales. The\r\nexcess of berries produced by the cultivated asparagus in comparison\r\nwith the wild plant is enormous. No doubt many highly cultivated\r\nplants, such as pears, pineapples, bananas, sugar-cane, etc., are\r\nnearly or quite sterile; and I am inclined to attribute this sterility\r\nto excess of food and to other unnatural conditions; but to this\r\nsubject I shall recur.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, as with the pig, rabbit, etc., and with those plants\r\nwhich are valued for their seed, the direct selection of the more\r\nfertile individuals has probably much increased their fertility; and in\r\nall cases this may have occurred indirectly, from the better chance of\r\nsome of the numerous offspring from the more fertile individuals having\r\nbeen preserved. But with cats, ferrets, and dogs, and with plants like\r\ncarrots, cabbages, and asparagus, which are not valued for their\r\nprolificacy, selection can have played only a subordinate part; and\r\ntheir increased fertility must be attributed to the more favourable\r\nconditions of life under which they have long existed.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Journal de Physiolog.,’ tom. ii., 1859, p. 385.\r\n\r\n [2] Dec. 1863, p. 484.\r\n\r\n [3] On ‘The Varieties of Wheat,’ p. 66.\r\n\r\n [4] Rengger, ‘Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ s. 336.\r\n\r\n [5] _See_ a memoir by MM.

On raising the two varieties from seed, _see_ s. 307.\r\n\r\n [16] ‘Bastarderzeugung,’ s. 216.\r\n\r\n [17] The results have since been published in ‘Journ. Asiatic Soc. of\r\n Bengal,’ 1867, p. 145.\r\n\r\n [18] The following facts, given by Kölreuter in his ‘Dritte\r\n Fortsetzung,’ ss. 34, 39, appear at first sight strongly to confirm\r\n Mr. Scott’s and Gärtner’s statements; and to a certain limited extent\r\n they do so. Kölreuter asserts, from innumerable observations, that\r\n insects incessantly carry pollen from one species and variety of\r\n Verbascum to another; and I can confirm this assertion; yet he found\r\n that the white and yellow varieties of _Verbascum lychnitis_ often\r\n grew wild mingled together: moreover, he cultivated these two\r\n varieties in considerable numbers during four years in his garden, and\r\n they kept true by seed; but when he crossed them, they produced\r\n flowers of an intermediate tint. Hence it might have been thought that\r\n both varieties must have a stronger elective affinity for the pollen\r\n of their own variety than for that of the other; this elective\r\n affinity, I may add of each species for its own pollen (Kölreuter,\r\n ‘Dritte Forts.’ s. 39, and Gärtner, ‘Bastarderz.,’ _passim_) being a\r\n perfectly well-ascertained power. But the force of the foregoing facts\r\n is much lessened by Gärtner’s numerous experiments, for, differently\r\n from Kölreuter, he never once got (‘Bastarderz.,’ s. 307) an\r\n intermediate tint when he crossed the yellow and white flowered\r\n varieties of Verbascum. So that the fact of the white and yellow\r\n varieties keeping true to their colour by seed does not prove that\r\n they were not mutually fertilised by the pollen carried by insects\r\n from one to the other.\r\n\r\n [19] ‘Amaryllidaceæ,’ 1837, p. 366. Gärtner has made a similar\r\n observation.\r\n\r\n [20] Kölreuter first observed this fact, ‘Mém. de l’Acad. de St.\r\n Petersburg,’ vol. iii. p. 127. _See also_ C. K. Sprengel, ‘Das\r\n Entdeckte Geheimniss,’ s. 345.\r\n\r\n [21] Namely, Barbarines, Pastissons, Giraumous: ‘Annal. des Sc.

Naudin considers\r\n these forms as undoubtedly varieties of _Cucurbita pepo._\r\n\r\n [24] ‘Mém.

But we now know conclusively from Gärtner\r\n (‘Bastarderz.,’ s. 34, 43) that the pollen of two species never acts\r\n _conjointly_ on a third species; still less will the pollen of a\r\n distinct species, mingled with a plant’s own pollen, if the latter be\r\n present in sufficient quantity, have any effect. The sole effect of\r\n mingling two kinds of pollen is to produce in the same capsule seeds\r\n which yield plants, some taking after the one and some after the other\r\n parent.\r\n\r\n [27] Mr. Scott has made some observations on the absolute sterility of\r\n a purple and white primrose (_Primula vulgaris_) when fertilised by\r\n pollen from the common primrose (‘Journal of Proc. of Linn. Soc.,’\r\n vol. viii., 1864, p. 98); but these observations require confirmation.\r\n I raised a number of purple-flowered long-styled seedlings from seed\r\n kindly sent me by Mr. Scott, and, though they were all in some degree\r\n sterile, they were much more fertile with pollen taken from the common\r\n primrose than with their own pollen. Mr. Scott has likewise described\r\n a red equal-styled cowslip (_P. veris,_ ibid. p. 106), which was found\r\n by him to be highly sterile when crossed with the common cowslip; but\r\n this was not the case with several equal-styled red seedlings raised\r\n by me from his plant. This variety of the cowslip presents the\r\n remarkable peculiarity of combining male organs in every respect like\r\n those of the short-styled form, with female organs resembling in\r\n function and partly in structure those of the long-styled form; so\r\n that we have the singular anomaly of the two forms combined in the\r\n same flower. Hence it is not surprising that these flowers should be\r\n spontaneously self-fertile in a high degree.\r\n\r\n [28] ‘Act. Acad.

ON THE GOOD EFFECTS OF CROSSING, AND ON THE EVIL EFFECTS\r\nOF CLOSE INTERBREEDING.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF CLOSE INTERBREEDING—AUGMENTATION OF MORBID\r\nTENDENCIES—GENERAL EVIDENCE OF THE GOOD EFFECTS DERIVED FROM CROSSING,\r\nAND ON THE EVIL EFFECTS FROM CLOSE INTERBREEDING—CATTLE, CLOSELY\r\nINTERBRED; HALF-WILD CATTLE LONG KEPT IN THE SAME\r\nPARKS—SHEEP—FALLOW-DEER—DOGS, RABBITS, PIGS—MAN, ORIGIN OF HIS\r\nABHORRENCE OF INCESTUOUS MARRIAGES—FOWLS—PIGEONS—HIVE-BEES—PLANTS,\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM CROSSING—MELONS,\r\nFRUIT-TREES, PEAS, CABBAGES, WHEAT, AND FOREST-TREES—ON THE INCREASED\r\nSIZE OF HYBRID PLANTS, NOT EXCLUSIVELY DUE TO THEIR STERILITY—ON\r\nCERTAIN PLANTS WHICH EITHER NORMALLY OR ABNORMALLY ARE SELF-IMPOTENT,\r\nBUT ARE FERTILE, BOTH ON THE MALE AND FEMALE SIDE, WHEN CROSSED WITH\r\nDISTINCT INDIVIDUALS EITHER OF THE SAME OR ANOTHER SPECIES—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gain in constitutional vigour, derived from an occasional cross\r\nbetween individuals of the same variety, but belonging to distinct\r\nfamilies, or between distinct varieties, has not been so largely or so\r\nfrequently discussed, as have the evil effects of too close\r\ninterbreeding. But the former point is the more important of the two,\r\ninasmuch as the evidence is more decisive. The evil results from close\r\ninterbreeding are difficult to detect, for they accumulate slowly, and\r\ndiffer much in degree with different species; whilst the good effects\r\nwhich almost invariably follow a cross are from the first manifest. It\r\nshould, however, be clearly understood that the advantage of close\r\ninterbreeding, as far as the retention of character is concerned, is\r\nindisputable, and often outweighs the evil of a slight loss of\r\nconstitutional vigour. In relation to the subject of domestication, the\r\nwhole question is of some importance, as too close interbreeding\r\ninterferes with the improvement of old races. It is important as\r\nindirectly bearing on Hybridism; and possibly on the extinction of\r\nspecies, when any form has become so rare that only a few individuals\r\nremain within a confined area. It bears in an important manner on the\r\ninfluence of free intercrossing, in obliterating individual\r\ndifferences, and thus giving uniformity of character to the individuals\r\nof the same race or species; for if additional vigour and fertility be\r\nthus gained, the crossed offspring will multiply and prevail, and the\r\nultimate result will be far greater than otherwise would have occurred.\r\nLastly, the question is of high interest, as bearing on mankind. I\r\nshall therefore discuss this subject at full length. As the facts which\r\nprove the evil effects of close interbreeding are more copious, though\r\nless decisive, than those on the good effects of crossing, I shall,\r\nunder each group of beings, begin with the former.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in defining what is meant by a cross; but this\r\nis by no means easy in regard to “breeding in and in” or “too close\r\ninterbreeding,” because, as we shall see, different species of animals\r\nare differently affected by the same degree of interbreeding. The\r\npairing of a father and daughter, or mother and son, or brothers and\r\nsisters, if carried on during several generations, is the closest\r\npossible form of interbreeding. But some good judges, for instance Sir\r\nJ. Sebright, believe that the pairing of a brother and sister is much\r\ncloser than that of parents and children; for when the father is\r\nmatched with his daughter he crosses, as is said, with only half his\r\nown blood. The consequences of close interbreeding carried on for too\r\nlong a time, are, as is generally believed, loss of size,\r\nconstitutional vigour, and fertility, sometimes accompanied by a\r\ntendency to malformation. Manifest evil does not usually follow from\r\npairing the nearest relations for two, three, or even four generations;\r\nbut several causes interfere with our detecting the evil—such as the\r\ndeterioration being very gradual, and the difficulty of distinguishing\r\nbetween such direct evil and the inevitable augmentation of any morbid\r\ntendencies which may be latent or apparent in the related parents. On\r\nthe other hand, the benefit from a cross, even when there has not been\r\nany very close interbreeding, is almost invariably at once conspicuous.\r\nThere is good reason to believe, and this was the opinion of that most\r\nexperienced observer Sir J. Sebright,[1] that the evil effects of close\r\ninterbreeding may be checked or quite prevented by the related\r\nindividuals being separated for a few generations and exposed to\r\ndifferent conditions of life. This conclusion is now held by many\r\nbreeders; for instance Mr. Carr[2] remarks, it is a well-known “fact\r\nthat a change of soil and climate effects perhaps almost as great a\r\nchange in the constitution as would result from an infusion of fresh\r\nblood.” I hope to show in a future work that consanguinity by itself\r\ncounts for nothing, but acts solely from related organisms generally\r\nhaving a similar constitution, and having been exposed in most cases to\r\nsimilar conditions.\r\n\r\nThat any evil directly follows from the closest interbreeding has been\r\ndenied by many persons; but rarely by any practical breeder; and never,\r\nas far as I know, by one who has largely bred animals which propagate\r\ntheir kind quickly. Many physiologists attribute the evil exclusively\r\nto the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies common\r\nto both parents; and that this is an active source of mischief there\r\ncan be no doubt. It is unfortunately too notorious that men and various\r\ndomestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution, and with a\r\nstrong hereditary disposition to disease, if not actually ill, are\r\nfully capable of procreating their kind. Close interbreeding, on the\r\nother hand, often induces sterility; and this indicates something quite\r\ndistinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both\r\nparents. The evidence immediately to be given convinces me that it is a\r\ngreat law of nature, that all organic beings profit from an occasional\r\ncross with individuals not closely related to them in blood; and that,\r\non the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding is injurious.\r\n\r\nVarious general considerations have had much influence in leading me to\r\nthis conclusion; but the reader will probably rely more on special\r\nfacts and opinions. The authority of experienced observers, even when\r\nthey do not advance the grounds of their belief, is of some little\r\nvalue. Now almost all men who have bred many kinds of animals and have\r\nwritten on the subject, such as Sir J. Sebright, Andrew Knight,\r\netc.,[3] have expressed the strongest conviction on the impossibility\r\nof long-continued close interbreeding. Those who have compiled works on\r\nagriculture, and have associated much with breeders, such as the\r\nsagacious Youatt, Low, etc., have strongly declared their opinion to\r\nthe same effect. Prosper Lucas, trusting largely to French authorities,\r\nhas come to a similar conclusion. The distinguished German\r\nagriculturist Hermann von Nathusius, who has written the most able\r\ntreatise on this subject which I have met with, concurs; and as I shall\r\nhave to quote from this treatise, I may state that Nathusius is not\r\nonly intimately acquainted with works on agriculture in all languages,\r\nand knows the pedigrees of our British breeds better than most\r\nEnglishmen, but has imported many of our improved animals, and is\r\nhimself an experienced breeder.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the evil effects of close interbreeding can most readily be\r\nacquired in the case of animals, such as fowls, pigeons, etc., which\r\npropagate quickly, and, from being kept in the same place, are exposed\r\nto the same conditions. Now I have inquired of very many breeders of\r\nthese birds, and I have hitherto not met with a single man who was not\r\nthoroughly convinced that an occasional cross with another strain of\r\nthe same sub-variety was absolutely necessary. Most breeders of highly\r\nimproved or fancy birds value their own strain, and are most unwilling,\r\nat the risk, in their opinion, of deterioration, to make a cross. The\r\npurchase of a first-rate bird of another strain is expensive, and\r\nexchanges are troublesome; yet all breeders, as far as I can hear,\r\nexcepting those who keep large stocks at different places for the sake\r\nof crossing, are driven after a time to take this step.\r\n\r\nAnother general consideration which has had great influence on my mind\r\nis, that with all hermaphrodite animals and plants, which it might have\r\nbeen thought would have perpetually fertilised themselves and been thus\r\nsubjected for long ages to the closest interbreeding, there is not a\r\nsingle species, as far as I can discover, in which the structure\r\nensures self-fertilisation. On the contrary, there are in a multitude\r\nof cases, as briefly stated in the fifteenth chapter, manifest\r\nadaptations which favour or inevitably lead to an occasional cross\r\nbetween one hermaphrodite and another of the same species; and these\r\nadaptive structures are utterly purposeless, as far as we can see, for\r\nany other end.\r\n\r\nWith _Cattle_ there can be no doubt that extremely close interbreeding\r\nmay be long carried on advantageously with respect to external\r\ncharacters, and with no manifest evil as far as constitution is\r\nconcerned. The case of Bakewell’s Longhorns, which were closely\r\ninterbred for a long period, has often been quoted; yet Youatt says[4]\r\nthe breed “had acquired a delicacy of constitution inconsistent with\r\ncommon management,” and “the propagation of the species was not always\r\ncertain.” But the Shorthorns offer the most striking case of close\r\ninterbreeding; for instance, the famous bull Favourite (who was himself\r\nthe offspring of a half-brother and sister from Foljambe) was matched\r\nwith his own daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter; so that\r\nthe produce of this last union, or the great-great-granddaughter, had\r\n15-16ths, or 93·75 per cent of the blood of Favourite in her veins.\r\nThis cow was matched with the bull Wellington, having 62·5 per cent of\r\nFavourite blood in his veins, and produced Clarissa; Clarissa was\r\nmatched with the bull Lancaster, having 68·75 of the same blood, and\r\nshe yielded valuable offspring.[5] Nevertheless Collings, who reared\r\nthese animals, and was a strong advocate for close breeding, once\r\ncrossed his stock with a Galloway, and the cows from this cross\r\nrealised the highest prices. Bates’s herd was esteemed the most\r\ncelebrated in the world. For thirteen years he bred most closely in and\r\nin; but during the next seventeen years, though he had the most exalted\r\nnotion of the value of his own stock, he thrice infused fresh blood\r\ninto his herd: it is said that he did this, not to improve the form of\r\nhis animals, but on account of their lessened fertility. Mr. Bates’s\r\nown view, as given by a celebrated breeder,[6] was, that “to breed\r\nin-and-in from a bad stock was ruin and devastation; yet that the\r\npractice may be safely followed within certain limits when the parents\r\nso related are descended from first-rate animals.” We thus see that\r\nthere has been much close interbreeding with Shorthorns; but Nathusius,\r\nafter the most careful study of their pedigrees, says that he can find\r\nno instance of a breeder who has strictly followed this practice during\r\nhis whole life. From this study and his own experience, he concludes\r\nthat close interbreeding is necessary to ennoble the stock; but that in\r\neffecting this the greatest care is necessary, on account of the\r\ntendency to infertility and weakness. It may be added, that another\r\nhigh authority[7] asserts that many more calves are born cripples from\r\nShorthorns than from other and less closely interbred races of cattle.\r\n\r\nAlthough by carefully selecting the best animals (as Nature effectually\r\ndoes by the law of battle) close interbreeding may be long carried on\r\nwith cattle, yet the good effects of a cross between almost any two\r\nbreeds is at once shown by the greater size and vigour of the\r\noffspring; as Mr. Spooner writes to me, “crossing distinct breeds\r\ncertainly improves cattle for the butcher.” Such crossed animals are of\r\ncourse of no value to the breeder; but they have been raised during\r\nmany years in several parts of England to be slaughtered;[8] and their\r\nmerit is now so fully recognised, that at fat-cattle shows a separate\r\nclass has been formed for their reception. The best fat ox at the great\r\nshow at Islington in 1862 was a crossed animal.\r\n\r\nThe half-wild cattle, which have been kept in British parks probably\r\nfor 400 or 500 years, or even for a longer period, have been advanced\r\nby Culley and others as a case of long-continued interbreeding within\r\nthe limits of the same herd without any consequent injury. With respect\r\nto the cattle at Chillingham, the late Lord Tankerville owned that they\r\nwere bad breeders.[9] The agent, Mr. Hardy, estimates (in a letter to\r\nme, dated May, 1861) that in the herd of about fifty the average number\r\nannually slaughtered, killed by fighting, and dying, is about ten, or\r\none in five. As the herd is kept up to nearly the same average number,\r\nthe annual rate of increase must be likewise about one in five. The\r\nbulls, I may add, engage in furious battles, of which battles the\r\npresent Lord Tankerville has given me a graphic description, so that\r\nthere will always be rigorous selection of the most vigorous males. I\r\nprocured in 1855 from Mr. D. Gardner, agent to the Duke of Hamilton,\r\nthe following account of the wild cattle kept in the Duke’s park in\r\nLanarkshire, which is about 200 acres in extent. The number of cattle\r\nvaries from sixty-five to eighty; and the number annually killed (I\r\npresume by all causes) is from eight to ten; so that the annual rate of\r\nincrease can hardly be more than one in six. Now in South America,\r\nwhere the herds are half-wild, and therefore offer a nearly fair\r\nstandard of comparison, according to Azara the natural increase of the\r\ncattle on an estancia is from one-third to one-fourth of the total\r\nnumber, or one in between three and four and this, no doubt, applies\r\nexclusively to adult animals fit for consumption. Hence the half-wild\r\nBritish cattle which have long interbred within the limits of the same\r\nherd are relatively far less fertile. Although in an unenclosed country\r\nlike Paraguay there must be some crossing between the different herds,\r\nyet even there the inhabitants believe that the occasional introduction\r\nof animals from distant localities is necessary to prevent\r\n“degeneration in size and diminution of fertility.”[10] The decrease in\r\nsize from ancient times in the Chillingham and Hamilton cattle must\r\nhave been prodigious, for Professor Rütimeyer has shown that they are\r\nalmost certainly the descendants of the gigantic _Bos primigenius._ No\r\ndoubt this decrease in size may be largely attributed to less\r\nfavourable conditions of life; yet animals roaming over large parks,\r\nand fed during severe winters, can hardly be considered as placed under\r\nvery unfavourable conditions.\r\n\r\nWith _Sheep_ there has often been long-continued interbreeding within\r\nthe limits of the same flock; but whether the nearest relations have\r\nbeen matched so frequently as in the case of Shorthorn cattle, I do not\r\nknow. The Messrs. Brown during fifty years have never infused fresh\r\nblood into their excellent flock of Leicesters. Since 1810 Mr. Barford\r\nhas acted on the same principle with the Foscote flock. He asserts that\r\nhalf a century of experience has convinced him that when two nearly\r\nrelated animals are quite sound in constitution, in-and-in breeding\r\ndoes not induce degeneracy; but he adds that he “does not pride himself\r\non breeding from the nearest affinities.” In France the Naz flock has\r\nbeen bred for sixty years without the introduction of a single strange\r\nram.[11] Nevertheless, most great breeders of sheep have protested\r\nagainst close interbreeding prolonged for too great a length of\r\ntime.[12] The most celebrated of recent breeders, Jonas Webb, kept five\r\nseparate families to work on, thus “retaining the requisite distance of\r\nrelationship between the sexes”;[13] and what is probably of greater\r\nimportance, the separate flocks will have been exposed to somewhat\r\ndifferent conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough by the aid of careful selection the near interbreeding of\r\nsheep may be long continued without any manifest evil, yet it has often\r\nbeen the practice with farmers to cross distinct breeds to obtain\r\nanimals for the butcher, which plainly shows that good of some kind is\r\nderived from this practice. We have excellent evidence on this head\r\nfrom Mr. S. Druce,[14] who gives in detail the comparative numbers of\r\nfour pure breeds and of a cross-breed which can be supported on the\r\nsame ground, and he gives their produce in fleece and carcase. A high\r\nauthority, Mr. Pusey, sums up the result in money value during an equal\r\nlength of time, namely (neglecting shillings), for Cotswolds 248_l_.,\r\nfor Leicesters 223_l_., for Southdowns 204_l_., for Hampshire Downs\r\n264_l_., and for the crossbred 293_l_. A former celebrated breeder,\r\nLord Somerville, states that his half-breeds from Ryelands and Spanish\r\nsheep were larger animals than either the pure Ryelands or pure Spanish\r\nsheep. Mr. Spooner concludes his excellent Essay on Crossing by\r\nasserting that there is a pecuniary advantage in judicious\r\ncross-breeding, especially when the male is larger than the female.[15]\r\n\r\nAs some of our British parks are ancient, it occurred to me that there\r\nmust have been long-continued close interbreeding with the fallow-deer\r\n(_Cervus dama_) kept in them; but on inquiry I find that it is a common\r\npractice to infuse new blood by procuring bucks from other parks. Mr.\r\nShirley,[16] who has carefully studied the management of deer, admits\r\nthat in some parks there has been no admixture of foreign blood from a\r\ntime beyond the memory of man. But he concludes “that in the end the\r\nconstant breeding in-and-in is sure to tell to the disadvantage of the\r\nwhole herd, though it may take a very long time to prove it; moreover,\r\nwhen we find, as is very constantly the case, that the introduction of\r\nfresh blood has been of the very greatest use to deer, both by\r\nimproving their size and appearance, and particularly by being of\r\nservice in removing the taint of ‘rickback,’ if not of other diseases,\r\nto which deer are sometimes subject when the blood has not been\r\nchanged, there can, I think, be no doubt but that a judicious cross\r\nwith a good stock is of the greatest consequence, and is indeed\r\nessential, sooner or later, to the prosperity of every well-ordered\r\npark.”\r\n\r\nMr. Meynell’s famous foxhounds have been adduced, as showing that no\r\nill effects follow from close interbreeding; and Sir J. Sebright\r\nascertained from him that he frequently bred from father and daughter,\r\nmother and son, and sometimes even from brothers and sisters. With\r\ngreyhounds also there has been much close interbreeding, but the best\r\nbreeders agree that it may be carried too far.[17] But Sir J. Sebright\r\ndeclares,[18] that by breeding in-and-in, by which he means matching\r\nbrothers and sisters, he has actually seen the offspring of strong\r\nspaniels degenerate into weak and diminutive lapdogs. The Rev. W. D.\r\nFox has communicated to me the case of a small lot of bloodhounds, long\r\nkept in the same family, which had become very bad breeders, and nearly\r\nall had a bony enlargement in the tail. A single cross with a distinct\r\nstrain of bloodhounds restored their fertility, and drove away the\r\ntendency to malformation in the tail. I have heard the particulars of\r\nanother case with bloodhounds, in which the female had to be held to\r\nthe male. Considering how rapid is the natural increase of the dog, it\r\nis difficult to understand the large price of all highly improved\r\nbreeds, which almost implies long-continued close interbreeding, except\r\non the belief that this process lessens fertility and increases\r\nliability to distemper and other diseases. A high authority, Mr.\r\nScrope, attributes the rarity and deterioration in size of the Scotch\r\ndeerhound (the few individuals formerly existing throughout the country\r\nbeing all related) in large part to close interbreeding.\r\n\r\nWith all highly-bred animals there is more or less difficulty in\r\ngetting them to procreate quickly, and all suffer much from delicacy of\r\nconstitution. A great judge of rabbits[19] says, “the long-eared does\r\nare often too highly bred or forced in their youth to be of much value\r\nas breeders, often turning out barren or bad mothers.” They often\r\ndesert their young, so that it is necessary to have nurse-rabbits, but\r\nI do not pretend to attribute all these evil results to close\r\ninterbreeding.[20]\r\n\r\nWith respect to _Pigs_ there is more unanimity amongst breeders on the\r\nevil effects of close interbreeding than, perhaps, with any other large\r\nanimal. Mr. Druce, a great and successful breeder of the Improved\r\nOxfordshires (a crossed race), writes, “without a change of boars of a\r\ndifferent tribe, but of the same breed, constitution cannot be\r\npreserved.” Mr. Fisher Hobbs, the raiser of the celebrated Improved\r\nEssex breed, divided his stock into three separate families, by which\r\nmeans he maintained the breed for more than twenty years, “by judicious\r\nselection from the _three distinct families._”[21] Lord Western was the\r\nfirst importer of a Neapolitan boar and sow. “From this pair he bred\r\nin-and-in, until the breed was in danger of becoming extinct, a sure\r\nresult (as Mr. Sidney remarks) of in-and-in breeding.” Lord Western\r\nthen crossed his Neapolitan pigs with the old Essex, and made the first\r\ngreat step towards the Improved Essex breed. Here is a more interesting\r\ncase. Mr. J. Wright, well known as a breeder, crossed[22] the same boar\r\nwith the daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter, and so on\r\nfor seven generations. The result was, that in many instances the\r\noffspring failed to breed; in others they produced few that lived; and\r\nof the latter many were idiotic, without sense, even to suck, and when\r\nattempting to move could not walk straight. Now it deserves especial\r\nnotice, that the two last sows produced by this long course of\r\ninterbreeding were sent to other boars, and they bore several litters\r\nof healthy pigs. The best sow in external appearance produced during\r\nthe whole seven generations was one in the last stage of descent; but\r\nthe litter consisted of this one sow. She would not breed to her sire,\r\nyet bred at the first trial to a stranger in blood. So that, in Mr.\r\nWright’s case, long-continued and extremely close interbreeding did not\r\naffect the external form or merit of the young; but with many of them\r\nthe general constitution and mental powers, and especially the\r\nreproductive functions, were seriously affected.\r\n\r\nNathusius gives[23] an analogous and even more striking case: he\r\nimported from England a pregnant sow of the large Yorkshire breed, and\r\nbred the product closely in-and-in for three generations: the result\r\nwas unfavourable, as the young were weak in constitution, with impaired\r\nfertility. One of the latest sows, which he esteemed a good animal,\r\nproduced, when paired with her own uncle (who was known to be\r\nproductive with sows of other breeds), a litter of six, and a second\r\ntime a litter of only five weak young pigs. He then paired this sow\r\nwith a boar of a small black breed, which he had likewise imported from\r\nEngland; this boar, when matched with sows of his own breed, produced\r\nfrom seven to nine young. Now, the sow of the large breed, which was so\r\nunproductive when paired with her own uncle, yielded to the small black\r\nboar, in the first litter twenty-one, and in the second litter eighteen\r\nyoung pigs; so that in one year she produced thirty-nine fine young\r\nanimals!\r\n\r\nAs in the case of several other animals already mentioned, even when no\r\ninjury is perceptible from moderately close interbreeding, yet, to\r\nquote the words of Mr. Coate (who five times won the annual gold medal\r\nof the Smithfield Club Show for the best pen of pigs), “Crosses answer\r\nwell for profit to the farmer, as you get more constitution and quicker\r\ngrowth; but for me, who sell a great number of pigs for breeding\r\npurposes, I find it will not do, as it requires many years to get\r\nanything like purity of blood again.”[24]\r\n\r\nAlmost all the animals as yet mentioned are gregarious, and the males\r\nmust frequently pair with their own daughters, for they expel the young\r\nmales as well as all intruders, until forced by old age and loss of\r\nstrength to yield to some stronger male. It is therefore not improbable\r\nthat gregarious animals may have been rendered less susceptible than\r\nnon-social species to the evil consequences of close interbreeding, so\r\nthat they may be enabled to live in herds without injury to their\r\noffspring. Unfortunately we do not know whether an animal like the cat,\r\nwhich is not gregarious, would suffer from close interbreeding in a\r\ngreater degree than our other domesticated animals. But the pig is not,\r\nas far as I can discover, strictly gregarious, and we have seen that it\r\nappears eminently liable to the evil effects of close interbreeding.\r\nMr. Huth, in the case of the pig, attributes (Chapter XXIV) these\r\neffects to their having been “cultivated most for their fat,” or to the\r\nselected individuals having had a weak constitution; but we must\r\nremember that it is great breeders who have brought forward the above\r\ncases, and who are far more familiar than ordinary men can be, with the\r\ncauses which are likely to interfere with the fertility of their\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe effects of close interbreeding in the case of man is a difficult\r\nsubject, on which I will say but little. It has been discussed by\r\nvarious authors under many points of view.[25] Mr. Tylor[26] has shown\r\nthat with widely different races in the most distant quarters of the\r\nworld, marriages between relations—even between distant relations—have\r\nbeen strictly prohibited. There are, however, many exceptions to the\r\nrule, which are fully given by Mr. Huth.[27] It is a curious problem\r\nhow these prohibitions arose during early and barbarous times. Mr.\r\nTylor is inclined to attribute them to the evil effects of\r\nconsanguineous marriages having been observed; and he ingeniously\r\nattempts to explain some apparent anomalies in the prohibition not\r\nextending equally to the relations on the male and female side. He\r\nadmits, however, that other causes, such as the extension of friendly\r\nalliances, may have come into play. Mr. W. Adam, on the other hand,\r\nconcludes that related marriages are prohibited and viewed with\r\nrepugnance, from the confusion which would thus arise in the descent of\r\nproperty, and from other still more recondite reasons. But I cannot\r\naccept these views, seeing that incest is held in abhorrence by savages\r\nsuch as those of Australia and South America,[28] who have no property\r\nto bequeath, or fine moral feelings to confuse, and who are not likely\r\nto reflect on distant evils to their progeny. According to Mr. Huth the\r\nfeeling is the indirect result of exogamy, inasmuch as when this\r\npractice ceased in any tribe and it became endogamous, so that\r\nmarriages were strictly confined to the same tribe, it is not unlikely\r\nthat a vestige of the former practice would still be retained, so that\r\nclosely-related marriages would be prohibited. With respect to exogamy\r\nitself Mr. MacLennan believes that it arose from a scarcity of women,\r\nowing to female infanticide, aided perhaps by other causes.\r\n\r\nIt has been clearly shown by Mr. Huth that there is no instinctive\r\nfeeling in man against incest any more than in gregarious animals. We\r\nknow also how readily any prejudice or feeling may rise to abhorrence,\r\nas shown by Hindus in regard to objects causing defilement. Although\r\nthere seems to be no strong inherited feeling in mankind against\r\nincest, it seems possible that men during primeval times may have been\r\nmore excited by strange females than by those with whom they habitually\r\nlived; in the same manner as according to Mr. Cupples,[29] male\r\ndeerhounds are inclined towards strange females, while the females\r\nprefer dogs with whom they have associated. If any such feeling\r\nformerly existed in man, this would have led to a preference for\r\nmarriages beyond the nearest kin, and might have been strengthened by\r\nthe offspring of such marriages surviving in greater numbers, as\r\nanalogy would lead us to believe would have occurred.\r\n\r\nWhether consanguineous marriages, such as are permitted in civilised\r\nnations, and which would not be considered as close interbreeding in\r\nthe case of our domesticated animals, cause any injury will never be\r\nknown with certainty until a census is taken with this object in view.\r\nMy son, George Darwin, has done what is possible at present by a\r\nstatistical investigation,[30] and he has come to the conclusion, from\r\nhis own researches and those of Dr. Mitchell, that the evidence as to\r\nany evil thus caused is conflicting, but on the whole points to the\r\nevil being very small.\r\n\r\n_Birds._—In the case of the _Fowl_ a whole array of authorities could\r\nbe given against too close interbreeding. Sir J. Sebright positively\r\nasserts that he made many trials, and that his fowls, when thus\r\ntreated, became long in the legs, small in the body, and bad\r\nbreeders.[31] He produced the famous Sebright Bantams by complicated\r\ncrosses, and by breeding in-and-in; and since his time there has been\r\nmuch close interbreeding with these animals; and they are now\r\nnotoriously bad breeders. I have seen Silver Bantams, directly\r\ndescended from his stock, which had become almost as barren as hybrids;\r\nfor not a single chicken had been that year hatched from two full nests\r\nof eggs. Mr. Hewitt says that with these Bantams the sterility of the\r\nmale stands, with rare exceptions, in the closest relation with their\r\nloss of certain secondary male characters: he adds, “I have noticed, as\r\na general rule, that even the slightest deviation from feminine\r\ncharacter in the tail of the male Sebright—say the elongation by only\r\nhalf an inch of the two principal tail feathers—brings with it improved\r\nprobability of increased fertility.”[32]\r\n\r\nMr. Wright states[33] that Mr. Clark, “whose fighting-cocks were so\r\nnotorious, continued to breed from his own kind till they lost their\r\ndisposition to fight, but stood to be cut up without making any\r\nresistance, and were so reduced in size as to be under those weights\r\nrequired for the best prizes; but on obtaining a cross from Mr.\r\nLeighton, they again resumed their former courage and weight.” It\r\nshould be borne in mind that game-cocks before they fought were always\r\nweighed, so that nothing was left to the imagination about any\r\nreduction or increase of weight. Mr. Clark does not seem to have bred\r\nfrom brothers and sisters, which is the most injurious kind of union;\r\nand he found, after repeated trials, that there was a greater reduction\r\nin weight in the young from a father paired with his daughter, than\r\nfrom a mother with her son. I may add that Mr. Eyton of Eyton, the\r\nwell-known ornithologist, who is a large breeder of Grey Dorkings,\r\ninforms me that they certainly diminish in size, and become less\r\nprolific, unless a cross with another strain is occasionally obtained.\r\nSo it is with Malays, according to Mr. Hewitt, as far as size is\r\nconcerned.[34]\r\n\r\nAn experienced writer[35] remarks that the same amateur, as is well\r\nknown, seldom long maintains the superiority of his birds; and this, he\r\nadds, undoubtedly is due to all his stock “being of the same blood;”\r\nhence it is indispensable that he should occasionally procure a bird of\r\nanother strain. But this is not necessary with those who keep a stock\r\nof fowls at different stations. Thus, Mr. Ballance, who has bred Malays\r\nfor thirty years, and has won more prizes with these birds than any\r\nother fancier in England, says that breeding in-and-in does not\r\nnecessarily cause deterioration; “but all depends upon how this is\r\nmanaged. My plan has been to keep about five or six distinct runs, and\r\nto rear about two hundred or three hundred chickens each year, and\r\nselect the best birds from each run for crossing. I thus secure\r\nsufficient crossing to prevent deterioration.”[36]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that there is almost complete unanimity with\r\npoultry-breeders that, when fowls are kept at the same place, evil\r\nquickly follows from interbreeding carried on to an extent which would\r\nbe disregarded in the case of most quadrupeds. Moreover, it is a\r\ngenerally received opinion that cross-bred chickens are the hardiest\r\nand most easily reared.[37] Mr. Tegetmeier, who has carefully attended\r\nto poultry of all breeds, says[38] that Dorking hens, allowed to run\r\nwith Houdan or Crevecœur cocks, “produce in the early spring chickens\r\nthat for size, hardihood, early maturity, and fitness for the market,\r\nsurpass those of any pure breed that we have ever raised.” Mr. Hewitt\r\ngives it as a general rule with fowls, that crossing the breed\r\nincreases their size. He makes this remark after stating that hybrids\r\nfrom the pheasant and fowl are considerably larger than either\r\nprogenitor: so again, hybrids from the male golden pheasant and female\r\ncommon pheasant “are of far larger size than either parent-bird.”[39]\r\nTo this subject of the increased size of hybrids I shall presently\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nWith _Pigeons,_ breeders are unanimous, as previously stated, that it\r\nis absolutely indispensable, notwithstanding the trouble and expense\r\nthus caused, occasionally to cross their much-prized birds with\r\nindividuals of another strain, but belonging, of course, to the same\r\nvariety. It deserves notice that, when size is one of the desired\r\ncharacters, as with pouters[40] the evil effects of close interbreeding\r\nare much sooner perceived than when small birds, such as short-faced\r\ntumblers, are valued. The extreme delicacy of the high fancy breeds,\r\nsuch as these tumblers and improved English carriers, is remarkable;\r\nthey are liable to many diseases, and often die in the egg or during\r\nthe first moult; and their eggs have generally to be hatched under\r\nfoster-mothers. Although these highly-prized birds have invariably been\r\nsubjected to much close interbreeding, yet their extreme delicacy of\r\nconstitution cannot perhaps be thus fully explained. Mr. Yarrell\r\ninformed me that Sir J. Sebright continued closely interbreeding some\r\nowl-pigeons, until from their extreme sterility he as nearly as\r\npossible lost the whole family. Mr. Brent[41] tried to raise a breed of\r\ntrumpeters, by crossing a common pigeon, and recrossing the daughter,\r\ngranddaughter, great-granddaughter, and great-great-granddaughter, with\r\nthe same male trumpeter, until he obtained a bird with 15/16 of\r\ntrumpeter’s blood; but then the experiment failed, for “breeding so\r\nclose stopped reproduction.” The experienced Neumeister[42] also\r\nasserts that the offspring from dovecotes and various other breeds are\r\n“generally very fertile and hardy birds:” so again MM. Boitard and\r\nCorbié,[43] after forty-five years’ experience, recommend persons to\r\ncross their breeds for amusement; for, if they fail to make interesting\r\nbirds, they will succeed under an economical point of view, “as it is\r\nfound that mongrels are more fertile than pigeons of pure race.”\r\n\r\nI will refer only to one other animal, namely, the Hive-bee, because a\r\ndistinguished entomologist has advanced this as a case of inevitable\r\nclose interbreeding. As the hive is tenanted by a single female, it\r\nmight have been thought that her male and female offspring would always\r\nhave bred together, more especially as bees of different hives are\r\nhostile to each other; a strange worker being almost always attacked\r\nwhen trying to enter another hive. But Mr. Tegetmeier has shown[44]\r\nthat this instinct does not apply to drones, which are permitted to\r\nenter any hive; so that there is no _à priori_ improbability of a queen\r\nreceiving a foreign drone. The fact of the union invariably and\r\nnecessarily taking place on the wing, during the queen’s nuptial\r\nflight, seems to be a special provision against continued\r\ninterbreeding. However this may be, experience has shown, since the\r\nintroduction of the yellow-banded Ligurian race into Germany and\r\nEngland, that bees freely cross: Mr. Woodbury, who introduced Ligurian\r\nbees into Devonshire, found during a single season that three stocks,\r\nat distances of from one to two miles from his hives, were crossed by\r\nhis drones. In one case the Ligurian drones must have flown over the\r\ncity of Exeter, and over several intermediate hives. On another\r\noccasion several common black queens were crossed by Ligurian drones at\r\na distance of from one to three and a half miles.[45]\r\n\r\n      _Plants._\r\n\r\nWhen a single plant of a new species is introduced into any country, if\r\npropagated by seed, many individuals will soon be raised, so that if\r\nthe proper insects be present there will be crossing. With\r\nnewly-introduced trees or other plants not propagated by seed we are\r\nnot here concerned. With old-established plants it is an almost\r\nuniversal practice occasionally to make exchanges of seed, by which\r\nmeans individuals which have been exposed to different conditions of\r\nlife,—and this, as we have seen with animals, diminishes the evil from\r\nclose interbreeding,—will occasionally be introduced into each\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nWith respect to individuals belonging to the same sub-variety, Gärtner,\r\nwhose accuracy and experience exceeded that of all other observers,\r\nstates[46] that he has many times observed good effects from this step,\r\nespecially with exotic genera, of which the fertility is somewhat\r\nimpaired, such as Passiflora, Lobelia, Fuchsia. Herbert also says,[47]\r\n“I am inclined to think that I have derived advantage from impregnating\r\nthe flower from which I wished to obtain seed with pollen from another\r\nindividual of the same variety, or at least from another flower, rather\r\nthan with its own.” Again, Professor Lecoq ascertained that crossed\r\noffspring are more vigorous and robust than their parents.[48]\r\n\r\nGeneral statements of this kind, however, can seldom be fully trusted:\r\nI therefore began a long series of experiments, continued for about ten\r\nyears, which will I think conclusively show the good effects of\r\ncrossing two distinct plants of the same variety, and the evil effects\r\nof long-continued self-fertilisation. A clear light will thus be thrown\r\non such questions, as why flowers are almost invariably constructed so\r\nas to permit, or favour, or necessitate the union of two individuals.\r\nWe shall clearly understand why monœcious and dioecious,—why\r\ndichogamous, dimorphic and trimorphic plants exist, and many other such\r\ncases. I intend soon to publish an account of these experiments, and I\r\ncan here give only a few cases in illustration. The plan which I\r\nfollowed was to grow plants in the same pot, or in pots of the same\r\nsize, or close together in the open ground; carefully to exclude\r\ninsects; and then to fertilise some of the flowers with pollen from the\r\nsame flower, and others on the same plant with pollen from a distinct\r\nbut adjoining plant. In many of these experiments, the crossed plants\r\nyielded much more seed than the self-fertilised plants; and I have\r\nnever seen the reversed case. The self-fertilised and crossed seeds\r\nthus obtained were allowed to germinate in the same glass vessel on\r\ndamp sand; and as the seeds germinated, they were planted in pairs on\r\nopposite sides of the same pot, with a superficial partition between\r\nthem, and were placed so as to be equally exposed to the light. In\r\nother cases the self-fertilised and crossed seeds were simply sown on\r\nopposite sides of the same small pot. I have, in short, followed\r\ndifferent plans, but in every case have taken all the precautions which\r\nI could think of, so that the two lots should be equally favoured. The\r\ngrowth of the plants raised from the crossed and self-fertilised seed,\r\nwere carefully observed from their germination to maturity, in species\r\nbelonging to fifty-two genera; and the difference in their growth, and\r\nin withstanding unfavourable conditions, was in most cases manifest and\r\nstrongly marked. It is of importance that the two lots of seed should\r\nbe sown or planted on opposite sides of the same pot, so that the\r\nseedlings may struggle against each other; for if sown separately in\r\nample and good soil, there is often but little difference in their\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nI will briefly describe two of the first cases observed by me. Six\r\ncrossed and six self-fertilised seeds of _Ipomoea purpurea,_ from\r\nplants treated in the manner above described, were planted as soon as\r\nthey had germinated, in pairs on opposite sides of two pots, and rods\r\nof equal thickness were given them to twine up. Five of the crossed\r\nplants grew from the first more quickly than the opposed\r\nself-fertilised plants; the sixth, however, was weakly and was for a\r\ntime beaten, but at last its sounder constitution prevailed and it shot\r\nahead of its antagonist. As soon as each crossed plant reached the top\r\nof its seven-foot rod its fellow was measured, and the result was that,\r\nwhen the crossed plants were seven feet high the self-fertilised had\r\nattained the average height of only five feet four and a half inches.\r\nThe crossed plants flowered a little before, and more profusely than\r\nthe self-fertilised plants. On opposite sides of another _ small_ pot a\r\nlarge number of crossed and self-fertilised seeds were sown, so that\r\nthey had to struggle for bare existence; a single rod was given to each\r\nlot: here again the crossed plants showed from the first their\r\nadvantage; they never quite reached the summit of the seven-foot rod,\r\nbut relatively to the self-fertilised plants their average height was\r\nas seven feet to five feet two inches. The experiment was repeated\r\nduring several succeeding generations, treated in exactly the same\r\nmanner, and with nearly the same result. In the second generation, the\r\ncrossed plants, which were again crossed, produced 121 seed-capsules,\r\nwhilst the self-fertilised, again self-fertilised, produced only 84\r\ncapsules.\r\n\r\nSome flowers of the _Mimulus luteus_ were fertilised with their own\r\npollen, and others were crossed with pollen from distinct plants\r\ngrowing in the same pot. The seeds were thickly sown on opposite sides\r\nof a pot. The seedlings were at first equal in height; but when the\r\nyoung crossed plants were half an inch, the self-fertilised plants were\r\nonly a quarter of an inch high. But this degree of inequality did not\r\nlast, for, when the crossed plants were four and a half inches high,\r\nthe self-fertilised were three inches, and they retained the same\r\nrelative difference till their growth was complete. The crossed plants\r\nlooked far more vigorous than the uncrossed, and flowered before them;\r\nthey produced also a far greater number of capsules. As in the former\r\ncase, the experiment was repeated during several succeeding\r\ngenerations. Had I not watched these plants of Mimulus and Ipomoea\r\nduring their whole growth, I could not have believed it possible, that\r\na difference apparently so slight as that of the pollen being taken\r\nfrom the same flower, or from a distinct plant growing in the same pot,\r\ncould have made so wonderful a difference in the growth and vigour of\r\nthe plants thus produced. This, under a physiological point of view, is\r\na most remarkable phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the benefit derived from crossing distinct varieties,\r\nplenty of evidence has been published. Sageret[49] repeatedly speaks in\r\nstrong terms of the vigour of melons raised by crossing different\r\nvarieties, and adds that they are more easily fertilised than common\r\nmelons, and produce numerous good seed. Here follows the evidence of an\r\nEnglish gardener:[50] “I have this summer met with better success in my\r\ncultivation of melons, in an unprotected state, from the seeds of\r\nhybrids (_i.e._ mongrels) obtained by cross impregnation, than with old\r\nvarieties. The offspring of three different hybridisations (one more\r\nespecially, of which the parents were the two most dissimilar varieties\r\nI could select) each yielded more ample and finer produce than any one\r\nof between twenty and thirty established varieties.”\r\n\r\nAndrew Knight[51] believed that his seedlings from crossed varieties of\r\nthe apple exhibited increased vigour and luxuriance; and M.\r\nChevreul[52] alludes to the extreme vigour of some of the crossed\r\nfruit-trees raised by Sageret.\r\n\r\nBy crossing reciprocally the tallest and shortest peas, Knight[53]\r\nsays: “I had in this experiment a striking instance of the stimulative\r\neffects of crossing the breeds; for the smallest variety, whose height\r\nrarely exceeded two feet, was increased to six feet: whilst the height\r\nof the large and luxuriant kind was very little diminished.” Mr. Laxton\r\ngave me seed-peas produced from crosses between four distinct kinds;\r\nand the plants thus raised were extraordinarily vigorous, being in each\r\ncase from one to two or three feet taller than the parent-forms growing\r\nclose alongside them.\r\n\r\nWiegmann[54] made many crosses between several varieties of cabbage;\r\nand he speaks with astonishment of the vigour and height of the\r\nmongrels, which excited the amazement of all the gardeners who beheld\r\nthem. Mr. Chaundy raised a great number of mongrels by planting\r\ntogether six distinct varieties of cabbage. These mongrels displayed an\r\ninfinite diversity of character; “But the most remarkable circumstance\r\nwas, that, while all the other cabbages and borecoles in the nursery\r\nwere destroyed by a severe winter, these hybrids were little injured,\r\nand supplied the kitchen when there was no other cabbage to be had.”\r\n\r\nMr. Maund exhibited before the Royal Agricultural Society[55] specimens\r\nof crossed wheat, together with their parent varieties; and the editor\r\nstates that they were intermediate in character, “united with that\r\ngreater vigour of growth, which it appears, in the vegetable as in the\r\nanimal world, is the result of a first cross.” Knight also crossed\r\nseveral varieties of wheat,[56] and he says “that in the years 1795 and\r\n1796, when almost the whole crop of corn in the island was blighted,\r\nthe varieties thus obtained, and these only, escaped in this\r\nneighbourhood, though sown in several different soils and situations.”\r\n\r\nHere is a remarkable case: M. Clotzsch[57] crossed _Pinus sylvestris_\r\nand _nigricans, Quercus robur_ and _pedunculata, Alnus glutinosa_ and\r\n_incana, Ulmus campestris_ and _ effusa_; and the cross-fertilised\r\nseeds, as well as seeds of the pure parent-trees, were all sown at the\r\nsame time and in the same place. The result was, that after an interval\r\nof eight years, the hybrids were one-third taller than the pure trees!\r\n\r\nThe facts above given refer to undoubted varieties, excepting the trees\r\ncrossed by Clotzsch, which are ranked by various botanists as\r\nstrongly-marked races, sub-species, or species. That true hybrids\r\nraised from entirely distinct species, though they lose in fertility,\r\noften gain in size and constitutional vigour, is certain. It would be\r\nsuperfluous to quote any facts; for all experimenters, Kolreuter,\r\nGärtner, Herbert, Sageret, Lecoq, and Naudin, have been struck with the\r\nwonderful vigour, height, size, tenacity of life, precocity, and\r\nhardiness of their hybrid productions. Gärtner[58] sums up his\r\nconviction on this head in the strongest terms. Kölreuter[59] gives\r\nnumerous precise measurements of the weight and height of his hybrids\r\nin his comparison with measurements of both parent-forms; and speaks\r\nwith astonishment of their “_statura portentosa,_” their “_ambitus\r\nvastissimus ac altitudo valde conspicua._” Some exceptions to the rule\r\nin the case of very sterile hybrids have, however, been noticed by\r\nGärtner and Herbert; but the most striking exceptions are given by Max\r\nWichura[60] who found that hybrid willows were generally tender in\r\nconstitution, dwarf, and short-lived.\r\n\r\nKolreuter explains the vast increase in the size of the roots, stems,\r\netc., of his hybrids, as the result of a sort of compensation due to\r\ntheir sterility, in the same way as many emasculated animals are larger\r\nthan the perfect males. This view seems at first sight extremely\r\nprobable, and has been accepted by various authors;[61] but Gärtner[62]\r\nhas well remarked that there is much difficulty in fully admitting it;\r\nfor with many hybrids there is no parallelism between the degree of\r\ntheir sterility and their increased size and vigour. The most striking\r\ninstances of luxuriant growth have been observed with hybrids which\r\nwere not sterile in any extreme degree. In the genus Mirabilis, certain\r\nhybrids are unusually fertile, and their extraordinary luxuriance of\r\ngrowth, together with their enormous roots[63] have been transmitted to\r\ntheir progeny. The result in all cases is probably in part due to the\r\nsaving of nutriment and vital force through the sexual organs acting\r\nimperfectly or not at all, but more especially to the general law of\r\ngood being derived from a cross. For it deserves especial attention\r\nthat mongrel animals and plants, which are so far from being sterile\r\nthat their fertility is often actually augmented, have, as previously\r\nshown, their size, hardiness, and constitutional vigour generally\r\nincreased. It is not a little remarkable that an accession of vigour\r\nand size should thus arise under the opposite contingencies of\r\nincreased and diminished fertility.\r\n\r\nIt is a perfectly well ascertained fact[64] that hybrids invariably\r\nbreed with either pure parent, and not rarely with a distinct species,\r\nmore readily than with one another. Herbert is inclined to explain even\r\nthis fact by the advantage derived from a cross; but Gärtner more\r\njustly accounts for it by the pollen of the hybrid, and probably its\r\novules, being in some degree vitiated, whereas the pollen and ovules of\r\nboth pure parents and of any third species are sound. Nevertheless,\r\nthere are some well-ascertained and remarkable facts, which, as we\r\nshall presently see, show that a cross by itself undoubtedly tends to\r\nincrease or re-establish the fertility of hybrids.\r\n\r\nThe same law, namely, that the crossed offspring both of varieties and\r\nspecies are larger than the parent-forms, holds good in the most\r\nstriking manner with hybrid animals as well as with mongrels. Mr.\r\nBartlett, who has had such large experience says, “Among all hybrids of\r\nvertebrated animals there is a marked increase of size.” He then\r\nenumerates many cases with mammals, including monkeys, and with various\r\nfamilies of birds.[65]\r\n\r\n      _On certain Hermaphrodite Plants which, either normally or\r\n      abnormally, require to be fertilised by pollen from a distinct\r\n      individual or species._\r\n\r\nThe facts now to be given differ from the foregoing, as self-sterility\r\nis not here the result of long-continued close interbreeding. These\r\nfacts are, however, connected with our present subject, because a cross\r\nwith a distinct individual is shown to be either necessary or\r\nadvantageous. Dimorphic and trimorphic plants, though they are\r\nhermaphrodites, must be reciprocally crossed, one set of forms by the\r\nother, in order to be fully fertile, and in some cases to be fertile in\r\nany degree. But I should not have noticed these plants, had it not been\r\nfor the following cases given by Dr. Hildebrand:—[66]\r\n\r\n_Primula sinensis_ is a reciprocally dimorphic species: Dr. Hildebrand\r\nfertilised twenty-eight flowers of both forms, each by pollen of the\r\nother form, and obtained the full number of capsules containing on an\r\naverage 42·7 seed per capsule; here we have complete and normal\r\nfertility. He then fertilised forty-two flowers of both forms with\r\npollen of the same form, but taken from a distinct plant, and all\r\nproduced capsules containing on an average only 19·6 seed. Lastly, and\r\nhere we come to our more immediate point, he fertilised forty-eight\r\nflowers of both forms with pollen of the same form and taken from the\r\nsame flower, and now he obtained only thirty-two capsules, and these\r\ncontained on an average 18·6 seed, or one less per capsule than in the\r\nformer case. So that, with these illegitimate unions, the act of\r\nimpregnation is less assured, and the fertility slightly less, when the\r\npollen and ovules belong to the same flower, than when belonging to two\r\ndistinct individuals of the same form. Dr. Hildebrand has recently made\r\nanalogous experiments on the long-styled form of _Oxalis rosea,_ with\r\nthe same result.[67]\r\n\r\nIt has recently been discovered that certain plants, whilst growing in\r\ntheir native country under natural conditions, cannot be fertilised\r\nwith pollen from the same plant. They are sometimes so utterly\r\nself-impotent, that, though they can readily be fertilised by the\r\npollen of a distinct species or even distinct genus, yet, wonderful as\r\nis the fact, they never produce a single seed by their own pollen. In\r\nsome cases, moreover, the plant’s own pollen and stigma mutually act on\r\neach other in a deleterious manner. Most of the facts to be given\r\nrelate to orchids, but I will commence with a plant belonging to a\r\nwidely different family.\r\n\r\nSixty-three flowers of _Corydalis cava,_ borne on distinct plants, were\r\nfertilised by Dr. Hildebrand[68] with pollen from other plants of the\r\nsame species; and fifty-eight capsules were obtained, including on an\r\naverage 4.5 seed in each. He then fertilised sixteen flowers produced\r\nby the same raceme, one with another, but obtained only three capsules,\r\none of which alone contained any good seeds, namely, two in number.\r\nLastly, he fertilised twenty-seven flowers, each with its own pollen;\r\nhe left also fifty-seven flowers to be spontaneously fertilised, and\r\nthis would certainly have ensued if it had been possible, for the\r\nanthers not only touch the stigma, but the pollen-tubes were seen by\r\nDr. Hildebrand to penetrate it; nevertheless these eighty-four flowers\r\ndid not produce a single seed-capsule! This whole case is highly\r\ninstructive, as it shows how widely different the action of the same\r\npollen is, according as it is placed on the stigma of the same flower,\r\nor on that of another flower on the same raceme, or on that of a\r\ndistinct plant.\r\n\r\nWith exotic Orchids several analogous cases have been observed, chiefly\r\nby Mr. John Scott.[69] _Oncidium sphacelatum_ has effective pollen, for\r\nMr. Scott fertilised two distinct species with it; the ovules are\r\nlikewise capable of impregnation, for they were readily fertilised by\r\nthe pollen of _O. divaricatum_; nevertheless, between one and two\r\nhundred flowers fertilised by their own pollen did not produce a single\r\ncapsule, though the stigmas were penetrated by the pollen-tubes. Mr.\r\nRobertson Munro, of the Royal Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh, also\r\ninforms me (1864) that a hundred and twenty flowers of this same\r\nspecies were fertilised by him with their own pollen, and did not\r\nproduce a capsule, but eight flowers, fertilised by the pollen of _O.\r\ndivaricatum,_ produced four fine capsules: again, between two and three\r\nhundred flowers of _O. divaricatum,_ fertilised by their own pollen,\r\ndid not set a capsule, but twelve flowers fertilised by _O. flexuosum_\r\nproduced eight fine capsules: so that here we have three utterly\r\nself-impotent species, with their male and female organs perfect, as\r\nshown by their mutual fertilisation. In these cases fertilisation was\r\neffected only by the aid of a distinct species. But, as we shall\r\npresently see, distinct plants, raised from seed, of _Oncidium\r\nflexuosum,_ and probably of the other species, would have been\r\nperfectly capable of fertilising each other, for this is the natural\r\nprocess. Again, Mr. Scott found that the pollen of a plant of _O.\r\nmicrochilum_ was effective, for with it he fertilised two distinct\r\nspecies; he found its ovules good, for they could be fertilised by the\r\npollen of one of these species, and by the pollen of a distinct plant\r\nof _O. microchilum_; but they could not be fertilised by pollen of the\r\nsame plant, though the pollen-tubes penetrated the stigma. An analogous\r\ncase has been recorded by M. Rivière[70] with two plants of _O.\r\ncavendishianum,_ which were both self-sterile, but reciprocally\r\nfertilised each other. All these cases refer to the genus Oncidium, but\r\nMr. Scott found that _Maxillaria atro-rubens_ was “totally\r\ninsusceptible of fertilisation with its own pollen,” but fertilised,\r\nand was fertilised by, a widely distinct species, viz. _M. squalens._\r\n\r\nAs these orchids had been grown under unnatural conditions in\r\nhot-houses, I concluded that their self-sterility was due to this\r\ncause. But Fritz Müller informs me that at Desterro, in Brazil, he\r\nfertilised above one hundred flowers of the above-mentioned _Oncidium\r\nflexuosum,_ which is there endemic, with its own pollen, and with that\r\ntaken from distinct plants: all the former were sterile, whilst those\r\nfertilised by pollen from any _other plant_ of the same species were\r\nfertile. During the first three days there was no difference in the\r\naction of the two kinds of pollen: that placed on stigma of the same\r\nplant separated in the usual manner into grains, and emitted tubes\r\nwhich penetrated the column, and the stigmatic chamber shut itself; but\r\nonly those flowers which had been fertilised by pollen taken from a\r\ndistinct plant produced seed-capsules. On a subsequent occasion these\r\nexperiments were repeated on a large scale with the same result. Fritz\r\nMüller found that four other endemic species of Oncidium were in like\r\nmanner utterly sterile with their own pollen, but fertile with that\r\nfrom any other plant: some of them likewise produced seed-capsules when\r\nimpregnated with pollen of widely distinct genera, such as Cyrtopodium,\r\nand Rodriguezia. _Oncidium crispum,_ however, differs from the\r\nforegoing species in varying much in its self-sterility; some plants\r\nproducing fine pods with their own pollen, others failing to do so in\r\ntwo or three instances, Fritz Müller observed that the pods produced by\r\npollen taken from a distinct flower on the same plant, were larger than\r\nthose produced by the flower’s own pollen. In _Epidendrum\r\ncinnabarinum,_ an orchid belonging to another division of the family,\r\nfine pods were produced by the plant’s own pollen, but they contained\r\nby weight only about half as much seed as the capsules which had been\r\nfertilised by pollen from a distinct plant, and in one instance from a\r\ndistinct species; moreover, a very large proportion, and in some cases\r\nnearly all the seeds produced by the plant’s own pollen, were destitute\r\nof an embryo. Some self-fertilised capsules of a Maxillaria were in a\r\nsimilar state.\r\n\r\nAnother observation made by Fritz Müller is highly remarkable, namely,\r\nthat with various orchids the plant’s own pollen not only fails to\r\nimpregnate the flower, but acts on the stigma, and is acted on, in an\r\ninjurious or poisonous manner. This is shown by the surface of the\r\nstigma in contact with the pollen, and by the pollen itself becoming in\r\nfrom three to five days dark brown, and then decaying. The\r\ndiscoloration and decay are not caused by parasitic cryptograms, which\r\nwere observed by Fritz Müller in only a single instance. These changes\r\nare well shown by placing on the same stigma, at the same time, the\r\nplant’s own pollen and that from a distinct plant of the same species,\r\nor of another species, or even of another and widely remote genus.\r\nThus, on the stigma of _Oncidium flexuosum,_ the plant’s own pollen and\r\nthat from a distinct plant were placed side by side, and in five days’\r\ntime the latter was perfectly fresh, whilst the plant’s own pollen was\r\nbrown. On the other hand, when the pollen of a distinct plant of the\r\n_Oncidium flexuosum_ and of the _ Epidendrum zebra (nov. spec.?)_ were\r\nplaced together on the same stigma, they behaved in exactly the same\r\nmanner, the grains separating, emitting tubes, and penetrating the\r\nstigma, so that the two pollen-masses, after an interval of eleven\r\ndays, could not be distinguished except by the difference of their\r\ncaudicles, which, of course, undergo no change. Fritz Müller has,\r\nmoreover, made a large number of crosses between orchids belonging to\r\ndistinct species and genera, and he finds that in all cases when the\r\nflowers are not fertilised their footstalks first begin to wither; and\r\nthe withering slowly spreads upwards until the germens fall off, after\r\nan interval of one or two weeks, and in one instance of between six and\r\nseven weeks; but even in this latter case, and in most other cases, the\r\npollen and stigma remained in appearance fresh. Occasionally, however,\r\nthe pollen becomes brownish, generally on the external surface, and not\r\nin contact with the stigma, as is invariably the case when the plant’s\r\nown pollen is applied.\r\n\r\nFritz Müller observed the poisonous action of the plant’s own pollen in\r\nthe above-mentioned _Oncidium flexuosum, O. unicorne, pubes (?),_ and\r\nin two other unnamed species. Also in two species of Rodriguezia, in\r\ntwo of Notylia, in one of Burlingtonia, and of a fourth genus in the\r\nsame group. In all these cases, except the last, it was proved that the\r\nflowers were, as might have been expected, fertile with pollen from a\r\ndistinct plant of the same species. Numerous flowers of one species of\r\nNotylia were fertilised with pollen from the same raceme; in two days’\r\ntime they all withered, the germens began to shrink, the pollen-masses\r\nbecame dark brown, and not one pollen-grain emitted a tube. So that in\r\nthis orchid the injurious action of the plant’s own pollen is more\r\nrapid than with _Oncidium flexuosum._ Eight other flowers on the same\r\nraceme were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same\r\nspecies: two of these were dissected, and their stigmas were found to\r\nbe penetrated by numberless pollen-tubes; and the germens of the other\r\nsix flowers became well developed. On a subsequent occasion many other\r\nflowers were fertilised with their own pollen, and all fell off dead in\r\na few days; whilst some flowers on the same raceme which had been left\r\nsimply unfertilised adhered and long remained fresh. We have seen that\r\nin cross-unions between extremely distinct orchids the pollen long\r\nremains undecayed; but Notylia behaved in this respect differently; for\r\nwhen its pollen was placed on the stigma of _ Oncidium flexuosum,_ both\r\nthe stigma and pollen quickly became dark brown, in the same manner as\r\nif the plant’s own pollen had been applied.\r\n\r\nFritz Müller suggests that, as in all these cases the plant’s own\r\npollen is not only impotent (thus effectually preventing\r\nself-fertilisation), but likewise prevents, as was ascertained in the\r\ncase of the Notylia and _Oncidium flexuosum,_ the action of\r\nsubsequently applied pollen from a distinct individual, it would be an\r\nadvantage to the plant to have its own pollen rendered more and more\r\ndeleterious; for the germens would thus quickly be killed, and dropping\r\noff, there would be no further waste in nourishing a part which\r\nultimately could be of no avail.\r\n\r\nThe same naturalist found in Brazil three plants of a Bignonia growing\r\nnear together. He fertilised twenty-nine flowerets on one of them with\r\ntheir own pollen, and they did not set a single capsule. Thirty flowers\r\nwere then fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant, one of the\r\nthree, and they yielded only two capsules. Lastly, five flowers were\r\nfertilised with pollen from a fourth plant growing at a distance, and\r\nall five produced capsules. Fritz Müller thinks that the three plants\r\nwhich grew near one another were probably seedlings from the same\r\nparent, and that from being closely related, they acted very feebly on\r\none another. This view is extremely probable, for he has since shown in\r\na remarkable paper,[71] that in the case of some Brazilian species of\r\nAbutilon, which are self-sterile, and between which he raised some\r\ncomplex hybrids, that these, if near relatives, were much less fertile\r\n_inter se,_ than when not closely related.\r\n\r\nWe now come to cases closely analogous with those just given, but\r\ndifferent in so far that only certain individuals of the species are\r\nself-sterile. This self-impotence does not depend on the pollen or\r\novules being in an unfit state for fertilisation, for both have been\r\nfound effective in union with other plants of the same or of a distinct\r\nspecies. The fact of plants having acquired so peculiar a constitution,\r\nthat they can be fertilised more readily by the pollen of a distinct\r\nspecies than by their own, is exactly the reverse of what occurs with\r\nall ordinary species. For in the latter the two sexual elements of the\r\nsame individual plant are of course capable of freely acting on each\r\nother; but are so constituted that they are more or less impotent when\r\nbrought into union with the sexual elements of a distinct species, and\r\nproduce more or less sterile hybrids.\r\n\r\nGärtner experimented on two plants of _Lobelia fulgens,_ brought from\r\nseparate places, and found[72] that their pollen was good, for he\r\nfertilised with it _L. cardinalis_ and _ syphilitica_; their ovules\r\nwere likewise good, for they were fertilised by the pollen of these\r\nsame two species; but these two plants of _L. fulgens_ could not be\r\nfertilised by their own pollen, as can generally be effected with\r\nperfect ease with this species. Again, the pollen of a plant of\r\n_Verbascum nigrum_ grown in a pot was found by Gärtner[73] capable of\r\nfertilising _V. lychnitis_ and _V. austriacum_; the ovules could be\r\nfertilised by the pollen of _V. thapsus_; but the flowers could not be\r\nfertilised by their own pollen. Kölreuter, also,[74] gives the case of\r\nthree garden plants of _Verbascum phœniceum,_ which bore during two\r\nyears many flowers; these he fertilised successfully with the pollen of\r\nno less than four distinct species, but they produced not a seed with\r\ntheir own apparently good pollen; subsequently these same plants, and\r\nothers raised from seed, assumed a strangely fluctuating condition,\r\nbeing temporarily sterile on the male or female side, or on both sides,\r\nand sometimes fertile on both sides; but two of the plants were\r\nperfectly fertile throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nWith _Reseda odorata_ I have found certain individuals quite sterile\r\nwith their own pollen, and so it is with the indigenous _Reseda lutea._\r\nThe self-sterile plants of both species were perfectly fertile when\r\ncrossed with pollen from any other individual of the same species.\r\nThese observations will hereafter be published in another work, in\r\nwhich I shall also show that seeds sent to me by Fritz Müller produced\r\nby plants of _Eschscholtzia californica_ which were quite self-sterile\r\nin Brazil, yielded in this country plants which were only slightly\r\nself-sterile.\r\n\r\nIt appears[75] that certain flowers on certain plants of _Lilium\r\ncandidum_ can be fertilised more freely by pollen from a distinct\r\nindividual than by their own. So, again, with the varieties of the\r\npotato. Tinzmann,[76] who made many trials with this plant, says that\r\npollen from another variety sometimes “exerts a powerful influence, and\r\nI have found sorts of potatoes which would not bear seed from\r\nimpregnation with the pollen of their own flowers would bear it when\r\nimpregnated with other pollen.” It does not, however, appear to have\r\nbeen proved that the pollen which failed to act on the flower’s own\r\nstigma was in itself good.\r\n\r\nIn the genus Passiflora it has long been known that several species do\r\nnot produce fruit, unless fertilised by pollen taken from distinct\r\nspecies: thus, Mr. Mowbray[77] found that he could not get fruit from\r\n_P. alata_ and _racemosa_ except by reciprocally fertilising them with\r\neach other’s pollen; and similar facts have been observed in Germany\r\nand France.[78] I have received two accounts of _P. quadrangularis_\r\nnever producing fruit from its own pollen, but doing so freely when\r\nfertilised in one case with the pollen of _ P. cœrulea,_ and in another\r\ncase with that of _P. edulis._ But in three other cases this species\r\nfruited freely when fertilised with its own pollen; and the writer in\r\none case attributed the favourable result to the temperature of the\r\nhouse having been raised from 5° to 10° Fahr. above the former\r\ntemperature, after the flowers were fertilised.[79] With respect to _P.\r\nlaurifolia,_ a cultivator of much experience has recently remarked[80]\r\nthat the flowers “must be fertilised with the pollen of _P. cœrulea,_\r\nor of some other common kind, as their own pollen will not fertilise\r\nthem.” But the fullest details on this subject have been given by\r\nMessrs. Scott and Robertson Munro:[81] plants of _ Passiflora racemosa,\r\ncœrulea,_ and _alata_ flowered profusely during many years in the\r\nBotanic Gardens of Edinburgh, and, though repeatedly fertilised with\r\ntheir own pollen, never produced any seed; yet this occurred at once\r\nwith all three species when they were crossed together in various ways.\r\nIn the case of _ P. cœrulea_ three plants, two of which grew in the\r\nBotanic Gardens, were all rendered fertile, merely by impregnating each\r\nwith pollen of one of the others. The same result was attained in the\r\nsame manner with _P. alata,_ but with only one plant out of three. As\r\nso many self-sterile species of Passiflora have been mentioned, it\r\nshould be stated that the flowers of the annual _P. gracilis_ are\r\nnearly as fertile with their own pollen as with that from a distinct\r\nplant; thus sixteen flowers spontaneously self-fertilised produced\r\nfruit, each containing on an average 21·3 seed, whilst fruit from\r\nfourteen crossed flowers contained 24·1 seed.\r\n\r\nReturning to _P. alata,_ I have received (1866) some interesting\r\ndetails from Mr. Robertson Munro. Three plants, including one in\r\nEngland, have already been mentioned which were inveterately\r\nself-sterile, and Mr. Munro informs me of several others which, after\r\nrepeated trials during many years, have been found in the same\r\npredicament. At some other places, however, this species fruits readily\r\nwhen fertilised with its own pollen. At Taymouth Castle there is a\r\nplant which was formerly grafted by Mr. Donaldson on a distinct\r\nspecies, name unknown, and ever since the operation it has produced\r\nfruit in abundance by its own pollen; so that this small and unnatural\r\nchange in the state of this plant has restored its self-fertility! Some\r\nof the seedlings from the Taymouth Castle plant were found to be not\r\nonly sterile with their own pollen, but with each other’s pollen, and\r\nwith the pollen of distinct species. Pollen from the Taymouth plant\r\nfailed to fertilise certain plants of the same species, but was\r\nsuccessful on one plant in the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens. Seedlings\r\nwere raised from this latter union, and some of their flowers were\r\nfertilised by Mr. Munro with their own pollen; but they were found to\r\nbe as self-impotent as the mother-plant had always proved, except when\r\nfertilised by the grafted Taymouth plant, and except, as we shall see,\r\nwhen fertilised by her own seedlings. For Mr. Munro fertilised eighteen\r\nflowers on the self-impotent mother-plant with pollen from these her\r\nown self-impotent seedlings, and obtained, remarkable as the fact is,\r\neighteen fine capsules full of excellent seed! I have met with no case\r\nin regard to plants which shows so well as this of _P. alata,_ on what\r\nsmall and mysterious causes complete fertility or complete sterility\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nThe facts hitherto given relate to the much-lessened or completely\r\ndestroyed fertility of pure species when impregnated with their own\r\npollen, in comparison with their fertility when impregnated by distinct\r\nindividuals or distinct species; but closely analogous facts have been\r\nobserved with hybrids.\r\n\r\nHerbert states[82] that having in flower at the same time nine hybrid\r\nHippeastrums, of complicated origin, descended from several species, he\r\nfound that “almost every flower touched with pollen from another cross\r\nproduced seed abundantly, and those which were touched with their own\r\npollen either failed entirely, or formed slowly a pod of inferior size,\r\nwith fewer seeds.” In the ‘Horticultural Journal’ he adds that “the\r\nadmission of the pollen of another cross-bred Hippeastrum (however\r\ncomplicated the cross) to any one flower of the number, is almost sure\r\nto check the fructification of the others.” In a letter written to me\r\nin 1839, Dr. Herbert says that he had already tried these experiments\r\nduring five consecutive years, and he subsequently repeated them, with\r\nthe same invariable result. He was thus led to make an analogous trial\r\non a pure species, namely, on the _Hippeastrum aulicum,_ which he had\r\nlately imported from Brazil: this bulb produced four flowers, three of\r\nwhich were fertilised by their own pollen, and the fourth by the pollen\r\nof a triple cross between _H. bulbulosum, reginæ,_ and _vittatum_; the\r\nresult was, that “the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to\r\ngrow, and after a few days perished entirely: whereas the pod\r\nimpregnated by the hybrid made vigorous and rapid progress to maturity,\r\nand bore good seed, which vegetated freely.” This is, indeed, as\r\nHerbert remarks, “a strange truth,” but not so strange as it then\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nAs a confirmation of these statements, I may add that Mr. M. Mayes[83]\r\nafter much experience in crossing the species of Amaryllis\r\n(Hippeastrum), says, “neither the species nor the hybrids will, we are\r\nwell aware, produce seed so abundantly from their own pollen as from\r\nthat of others.” So, again, Mr. Bidwell, in New South Wales[84] asserts\r\nthat _Amaryllis belladonna_ bears many more seeds when fertilised by\r\nthe pollen of _ Brunswigia_ (_Amaryllis_ of some authors) _ josephinæ_\r\nor of _B. multiflora,_ than when fertilised by its own pollen. Mr.\r\nBeaton dusted four flowers of a Cyrtanthus with their own pollen, and\r\nfour with the pollen of _Vallota (Amaryllis) purpurea_; on the seventh\r\nday “those which received their own pollen slackened their growth, and\r\nultimately perished; those which were crossed with the Vallota held\r\non.”[85] These latter cases, however, relate to uncrossed species, like\r\nthose before given with respect to Passiflora, Orchids, etc., and are\r\nhere referred to only because the plants belong to the same group of\r\nAmaryllidaceæ.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments on the hybrid Hippeastrums, if Herbert had found\r\nthat the pollen of two or three kinds alone had been more efficient on\r\ncertain kinds than their own pollen, it might have been argued that\r\nthese, from their mixed parentage, had a closer mutual affinity than\r\nthe others; but this explanation is inadmissible, for the trials were\r\nmade reciprocally backwards and forwards on nine different hybrids; and\r\na cross, whichever way taken, always proved highly beneficial. I can\r\nadd a striking and analogous case from experiments made by the Rev. A.\r\nRawson, of Bromley Common, with some complex hybrids of Gladiolus. This\r\nskilful horticulturist possessed a number of French varieties,\r\ndiffering from each other only in the colour and size of the flowers,\r\nall descended from Gandavensis, a well-known old hybrid, said to be\r\ndescended from _G. natalensis_ by the pollen of _ G.\r\noppositiflorus._[86] Mr. Rawson, after repeated trials, found that none\r\nof the varieties would set seed with their own pollen, although taken\r\nfrom distinct plants of the same variety (which had, of course, been\r\npropagated by bulbs), but that they all seeded freely with pollen from\r\nany other variety. To give two examples: Ophir did not produce a\r\ncapsule with its own pollen, but when fertilised with that of Janire,\r\nBrenchleyensis, Vulcain and Linné, it produced ten fine capsules; but\r\nthe pollen of Ophir was good, for when Linné was fertilised by it seven\r\ncapsules were produced. This latter variety, on the other hand, was\r\nutterly barren with its own pollen, which we have seen was perfectly\r\nefficient on Ophir. Altogether, Mr. Rawson, in the year 1861 fertilised\r\ntwenty-six flowers borne by four varieties with pollen taken from other\r\nvarieties, and every single flower produced a fine seed-capsule;\r\nwhereas fifty-two flowers on the same plants, fertilised at the same\r\ntime with their own pollen, did not yield a single seed-capsule. Mr.\r\nRawson fertilised, in some cases, the alternate flowers, and in other\r\ncases all those down one side of the spike, with pollen of other\r\nvarieties, and the remaining flowers with their own pollen. I saw these\r\nplants when the capsules were nearly mature, and their curious\r\narrangement at once brought full conviction to the mind that an immense\r\nadvantage had been derived from crossing these hybrids.\r\n\r\nLastly, I have heard from Dr. E. Bornet, of Antibes, who has made\r\nnumerous experiments in crossing the species of Cistus, but has not yet\r\npublished the results, that, when any of these hybrids are fertile,\r\nthey may be said to be, in regard to function, dioecious; “for the\r\nflowers are always sterile when the pistil is fertilised by pollen\r\ntaken from the same flower or from flowers on the same plant. But they\r\nare often fertile if pollen be employed from a distinct individual of\r\nthe same hybrid nature, or from a hybrid made by a reciprocal cross.”\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._—That plants should be self-sterile, although both sexual\r\nelements are in a fit state for reproduction, appears at first sight\r\nopposed to all analogy. With respect to the species, all the\r\nindividuals of which are in this state, although living under their\r\nnatural conditions, we may conclude that their self-sterility has been\r\nacquired for the sake of effectually preventing self-fertilisation. The\r\ncase is closely analogous with that of dimorphic and trimorphic or\r\nheterostyled plants, which can be fully fertilised only by plants\r\nbelonging to a different form, and not, as in the foregoing cases,\r\nindifferently by any other individual of the species. Some of these\r\nhetero-styled plants are completely sterile with pollen taken from the\r\nsame plant or from the same form. With respect to species living under\r\ntheir natural conditions, of which only certain individuals are\r\nself-sterile (as with _Reseda lutea_), it is probable that these have\r\nbeen rendered self-sterile to ensure occasional cross-fertilisation,\r\nwhilst other individuals have remained self-fertile to ensure the\r\npropagation of the species. The case seems to be parallel with that of\r\nplants which produce, as Hermann Müller has discovered, two forms—one\r\nbearing more conspicuous flowers with their structure adapted for\r\ncross-fertilisation by insects, and the other form with less\r\nconspicuous flowers adapted for self-fertilisation. The self-sterility,\r\nhowever, of some of the foregoing plants is incidental on the\r\nconditions to which they have been subjected, as with the\r\nEschscholtzia, the _Verbascum phœniceum_ (the sterility of which varied\r\naccording to the season), and with the _Passiflora alata,_ which\r\nrecovered its self-fertility when grafted on a different stock.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe in the above several cases the graduated\r\nseries from plants which, when fertilised by their own pollen, yield\r\nthe full number of seeds, but with the seedlings a little dwarfed in\r\nstature—to plants which when self-fertilised yield few seeds—to those\r\nwhich yield none, but have their ovaria somewhat developed—and, lastly,\r\nto those in which the plant’s own pollen and stigma mutually act on one\r\nanother like poison. It is also interesting to observe on how slight a\r\ndifference in the nature of the pollen or of the ovules complete\r\nself-sterility or complete self-fertility must depend in some of the\r\nabove cases. Every individual of the self-sterile species appears to be\r\ncapable of producing the full complement of seed when fertilised by the\r\npollen of any other individual (though judging from the facts given\r\nwith respect to Abutilon the nearest kin must be excepted); but not one\r\nindividual can be fertilised by its own pollen. As every organism\r\ndiffers in some slight degree from every other individual of the same\r\nspecies, so no doubt it is with their pollen and ovules; and in the\r\nabove cases we must believe that complete self-sterility and complete\r\nself-fertility depend on such slight differences in the ovules and\r\npollen, and not their having been differentiated in some special manner\r\nin relation to one another; for it is impossible that the sexual\r\nelements of many thousand individuals should have been specialised in\r\nrelation to every other individual. In some, however, of the above\r\ncases, as with certain Passifloras, an amount of differentiation\r\nbetween the pollen and ovules sufficient for fertilisation is gained\r\nonly by employing pollen from a distinct species; but this is probably\r\nthe result of such plants having been rendered somewhat sterile from\r\nthe unnatural conditions to which they have been exposed.\r\n\r\nExotic animals confined in menageries are sometimes in nearly the same\r\nstate as the above-described self-impotent plants; for, as we shall see\r\nin the following chapter, certain monkeys, the larger carnivora,\r\nseveral finches, geese, and pheasants, cross together, quite as freely\r\nas, or even more freely than the individuals of the same species breed\r\ntogether. Cases will, also, be given of sexual incompatibility between\r\ncertain, male and female domesticated animals, which, nevertheless, are\r\nfertile when matched with any other individual of the same kind.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this chapter it was shown that the crossing of\r\nindividuals belonging to distinct families of the same race, or to\r\ndifferent races or species, gives increased size and constitutional\r\nvigour to the offspring, and, except in the case of crossed species,\r\nincreased fertility. The evidence rests on the universal testimony of\r\nbreeders (for it should be observed that I am not here speaking of the\r\nevil results of close interbreeding), and is practically exemplified in\r\nthe higher value of cross-bred animals for immediate consumption. The\r\ngood results of crossing have also been demonstrated with some animals\r\nand with numerous plants, by actual weight and measurement. Although\r\nanimals of pure blood will obviously be deteriorated by crossing, as\r\nfar as their characteristic qualities are concerned, there seems to be\r\nno exception to the rule that advantages of the kind just mentioned are\r\nthus gained, even when there has not been any previous close\r\ninterbreeding; and the rule applies to such animals as cattle and\r\nsheep, which can long resist breeding in-and-in between the nearest\r\nblood-relations.\r\n\r\nIn the case of crossed species, although size, vigour, precocity, and\r\nhardiness are, with rare exceptions, gained, fertility, in a greater or\r\nless degree, is lost; but the gain in the above respects can hardly be\r\nattributed to the principle of compensation; for there is no close\r\nparallelism between the increased size and vigour of hybrid offspring\r\nand their sterility. Moreover, it has been clearly proved that mongrels\r\nwhich are perfectly fertile gain these same advantages as well as\r\nsterile hybrids.\r\n\r\nWith the higher animals no special adaptations for ensuring occasional\r\ncrosses between distinct families seem to exist. The eagerness of the\r\nmales, leading to severe competition between them, is sufficient; for\r\neven with gregarious animals, the old and dominant males will be\r\ndispossessed after a time and it would be a mere chance if a closely\r\nrelated member of the same family were to be the victorious successor.\r\nThe structure of many of the lower animals, when they are\r\nhermaphrodites, is such as to prevent the ovules being fertilised by\r\nthe male element of the same individual; so that the concourse of two\r\nindividuals is necessary. In other cases the access of the male element\r\nof a distinct individual is at least possible. With plants, which are\r\naffixed to the ground and cannot wander from place to place like\r\nanimals, the numerous adaptations for cross-fertilisation are\r\nwonderfully perfect, as has been admitted by every one who has studied\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe evil consequences of long-continued close interbreeding are not so\r\neasily recognised as the good effects from crossing, for the\r\ndeterioration is gradual. Nevertheless, it is the general opinion of\r\nthose who have had most experience, especially with animals which\r\npropagate quickly, that evil does inevitably follow sooner or later,\r\nbut at different rates with different animals. No doubt a false belief\r\nmay, like a superstition, prevail widely; yet it is difficult to\r\nsuppose that so many acute observers have all been deceived at the\r\nexpense of much cost and trouble. A male animal may sometimes be paired\r\nwith his daughter, granddaughter, and so on, even for seven\r\ngenerations, without any manifest bad result: but the experiment has\r\nnever been tried of matching brothers and sisters, which is considered\r\nthe closest form of interbreeding, for an equal number of generations.\r\nThere is good reason to believe that by keeping the members of the same\r\nfamily in distinct bodies, especially if exposed to somewhat different\r\nconditions of life, and by occasionally crossing these families, the\r\nevil results of interbreeding may be much diminished or quite\r\neliminated. These results are loss of constitutional vigour, size, and\r\nfertility; but there is no necessary deterioration in the general form\r\nof the body, or in other good qualities. We have seen that with pigs\r\nfirst-rate animals have been produced after long-continued close\r\ninterbreeding, though they had become extremely infertile when paired\r\nwith their near relations. The loss of fertility, when it occurs, seems\r\nnever to be absolute, but only relative to animals of the same blood;\r\nso that this sterility is to a certain extent analogous with that of\r\nself-impotent plants which cannot be fertilised by their own pollen,\r\nbut are perfectly fertile with pollen of any other individual of the\r\nsame species. The fact of infertility of this peculiar nature being one\r\nof the results of long-continued interbreeding, shows that\r\ninterbreeding does not act merely by combining and augmenting various\r\nmorbid tendencies common to both parents; for animals with such\r\ntendencies, if not at the time actually ill, can generally propagate\r\ntheir kind. Although offspring descended from the nearest\r\nblood-relations are not necessarily deteriorated in structure, yet some\r\nauthors believe that they are eminently liable to malformations; and\r\nthis is not improbable, as everything which lessens the vital powers\r\nacts in this manner. Instances of this kind have been recorded in the\r\ncase of pigs, bloodhounds, and some other animals.\r\n\r\nFinally, when we consider the various facts now given which plainly\r\nshow that good follows from crossing, and less plainly that evil\r\nfollows from close interbreeding, and when we bear in mind that with\r\nvery many organisms elaborate provisions have been made for the\r\noccasional union of distinct individuals, the existence of a great law\r\nof nature is almost proved; namely, that the crossing of animals and\r\nplants which are not closely related to each other is highly beneficial\r\nor even necessary, and that interbreeding prolonged during many\r\ngenerations is injurious.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘The Art of Improving the Breed, etc.,’ 1809, p. 16.\r\n\r\n [2] ‘The History of the Rise and Progress of the Killerby, etc.\r\n Herds,’ p. 41.\r\n\r\n [3] For Andrew Knight, _see_ A.

No\r\n doubt on this side of the question many advocates have injured their\r\n cause by inaccuracies: thus it has been stated (Devay, ‘Du Danger des\r\n Mariages,’ etc., 1862, p. 141) that the marriages of cousins have been\r\n prohibited by the legislature of Ohio; but I have been assured, in\r\n answer to inquiries made in the United States, that this statement is\r\n a mere fable.\r\n\r\n [26] _See_ his interesting work on the ‘Early History of Man,’ 1865,\r\n chap. x.\r\n\r\n [27] ‘The Marriage of Near Kin,’ 1875.

ON THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF CHANGED\r\nCONDITIONS OF LIFE: STERILITY FROM VARIOUS CAUSES.\r\n\r\nON THE GOOD DERIVED FROM SLIGHT CHANGES IN THE CONDITIONS OF\r\nLIFE—STERILITY FROM CHANGED CONDITIONS, IN ANIMALS, IN THEIR NATIVE\r\nCOUNTRY AND IN MENAGERIES—MAMMALS, BIRDS, AND INSECTS—LOSS OF SECONDARY\r\nSEXUAL CHARACTERS AND OF INSTINCTS—CAUSES OF STERILITY—STERILITY OF\r\nDOMESTICATED ANIMALS FROM CHANGED CONDITIONS—SEXUAL INCOMPATIBILITY OF\r\nINDIVIDUAL ANIMALS—STERILITY OF PLANTS FROM CHANGED CONDITIONS OF\r\nLIFE—CONTABESCENCE OF THE ANTHERS—MONSTROSITIES AS A CAUSE OF\r\nSTERILITY—DOUBLE FLOWERS—SEEDLESS FRUIT—STERILITY FROM THE EXCESSIVE\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS OF VEGETATION—FROM LONG-CONTINUED PROPAGATION\r\nBY BUDS—INCIPIENT STERILITY THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF DOUBLE FLOWERS AND\r\nSEEDLESS FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Good derived from slight Changes in the Conditions of Life._—In\r\nconsidering whether any facts were known which might throw light on the\r\nconclusion arrived at in the last chapter, namely, that benefits ensue\r\nfrom crossing, and that it is a law of nature that all organic beings\r\nshould occasionally cross, it appeared to me probable that the good\r\nderived from slight changes in the conditions of life, from being an\r\nanalogous phenomenon, might serve this purpose. No two individuals, and\r\nstill less no two varieties, are absolutely alike in constitution and\r\nstructure; and when the germ of one is fertilised by the male element\r\nof another, we may believe that it is acted on in a somewhat similar\r\nmanner as an individual when exposed to slightly changed conditions.\r\nNow, every one must have observed the remarkable influence on\r\nconvalescents of a change of residence, and no medical man doubts the\r\ntruth of this fact. Small farmers who hold but little land are\r\nconvinced that their cattle derive great benefit from a change of\r\npasture. In the case of plants, the evidence is strong that a great\r\nadvantage is derived from exchanging seeds, tubers, bulbs, and cuttings\r\nfrom one soil or place to another as different as possible.\r\n\r\nThe belief that plants are thus benefited, whether or not well founded,\r\nhas been firmly maintained from the time of Columella, who wrote\r\nshortly after the Christian era, to the present day; and it now\r\nprevails in England, France, and Germany.[1] A sagacious observer,\r\nBradley, writing in 1724,[2] says, “When we once become Masters of a\r\ngood Sort of Seed, we should at least put it into Two or Three Hands,\r\nwhere the Soils and Situations are as different as possible; and every\r\nYear the Parties should change with one another; by which Means, I find\r\nthe Goodness of the Seed will be maintained for several Years. For Want\r\nof this Use many Farmers have failed in their Crops and been great\r\nLosers.” He then gives his own practical experience on this head. A\r\nmodern writer[3] asserts, “Nothing can be more clearly established in\r\nagriculture than that the continual growth of any one variety in the\r\nsame district makes it liable to deterioration either in quality or\r\nquantity.” Another writer states that he sowed close together in the\r\nsame field two lots of wheat-seed, the product of the same original\r\nstock, one of which had been grown on the same land and the other at a\r\ndistance, and the difference in favour of the crop from the latter seed\r\nwas remarkable. A gentleman in Surrey who has long made it his business\r\nto raise wheat to sell for seed, and who has constantly realised in the\r\nmarket higher prices than others, assures me that he finds it\r\nindispensable continually to change his seed; and that for this purpose\r\nhe keeps two farms differing much in soil and elevation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the tubers of the potato, I find that at the present\r\nday the practice of exchanging sets is almost everywhere followed. The\r\ngreat growers of potatoes in Lancashire formerly used to get tubers\r\nfrom Scotland, but they found that “a change from the moss-lands, and\r\n_vice versa,_ was generally sufficient.” In former times in France the\r\ncrop of potatoes in the Vosges had become reduced in the course of\r\nfifty or sixty years in the proportion from 120-150 to 30-40 bushels;\r\nand the famous Oberlin attributed the surprising good which he effected\r\nin large part to changing the sets.[4]\r\n\r\nA well-known practical gardener, Mr. Robson[5] positively states that\r\nhe has himself witnessed decided advantage from obtaining bulbs of the\r\nonion, tubers of the potato, and various seeds, all of the same kind,\r\nfrom different soils and distant parts of England. He further states\r\nthat with plants propagated by cuttings, as with the Pelargonium, and\r\nespecially the Dahlia, manifest advantage is derived from getting\r\nplants of the same variety, which have been cultivated in another\r\nplace; or, “where the extent of the place allows, to take cuttings from\r\none description of soil to plant on another, so as to afford the change\r\nthat seems so necessary to the well-being of the plants.” He maintains\r\nthat after a time an exchange of this nature is “forced on the grower,\r\nwhether he be prepared for it or not.” Similar remarks have been made\r\nby another excellent gardener, Mr. Fish, namely, that cuttings of the\r\nsame variety of Calceolaria, which he obtained from a neighbour,\r\n“showed much greater vigour than some of his own that were treated in\r\nexactly the same manner,” and he attributed this solely to his own\r\nplants having become “to a certain extent worn out or tired of their\r\nquarters.” Something of this kind apparently occurs in grafting and\r\nbudding fruit-trees; for, according to Mr. Abbey, grafts or buds\r\ngenerally take with greater facility on a distinct variety or even\r\nspecies, or on a stock previously grafted, than on stocks raised from\r\nseeds of the variety which is to be grafted; and he believes this\r\ncannot be altogether explained by the stocks in question being better\r\nadapted to the soil and climate of the place. It should, however, be\r\nadded, that varieties grafted or budded on very distinct kinds, though\r\nthey may take more readily and grow at first more vigorously than when\r\ngrafted on closely allied stocks, afterwards often become unhealthy.\r\n\r\nI have studied M. Tessier’s careful and elaborate experiments[6] made\r\nto disprove the common belief that good is derived from a change of\r\nseed; and he certainly shows that the same seed may with care be\r\ncultivated on the same farm (it is not stated whether on exactly the\r\nsame soil) for ten consecutive years without loss. Another excellent\r\nobserver, Colonel Le Couteur[7] has come to the same conclusion; but\r\nthen he expressly adds, if the same seed be used, “that which is grown\r\non land manured from the mixen one year becomes seed for land prepared\r\nwith lime, and that again becomes seed for land dressed with ashes,\r\nthen for land dressed with mixed manure, and so on.” But this in effect\r\nis a systematic exchange of seed, within the limits of the same farm.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the belief, which has long been held by many cultivators,\r\nthat good follows from exchanging seed, tubers, etc., seems to be\r\nfairly well founded. It seems hardly credible that the advantage thus\r\nderived can be due to the seeds, especially if very small ones,\r\nobtaining in one soil some chemical element deficient in the other and\r\nin sufficient quantity to influence the whole after-growth of the\r\nplant. As plants after once germinating are fixed to the same spot, it\r\nmight have been anticipated that they would show the good effects of a\r\nchange more plainly than do animals which continually wander about; and\r\nthis apparently is the case. Life depending on, or consisting in, an\r\nincessant play of the most complex forces, it would appear that their\r\naction is in some way stimulated by slight changes in the circumstances\r\nto which each organism is exposed. All forces throughout nature, as Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer[8] remarks, tend towards an equilibrium, and for the\r\nlife of each organism it is necessary that this tendency should be\r\nchecked. These views and the foregoing facts probably throw light, on\r\nthe one hand, on the good effects of crossing the breed, for the germ\r\nwill be thus slightly modified or acted on by new forces; and on the\r\nother hand, on the evil effects of close interbreeding prolonged during\r\nmany generations, during which the germ will be acted on by a male\r\nhaving almost identically the same constitution.\r\n\r\n      _Sterility from Changed Conditions of Life._\r\n\r\nI will now attempt to show that animals and plants, when removed from\r\ntheir natural conditions, are often rendered in some degree infertile\r\nor completely barren; and this occurs even when the conditions have not\r\nbeen greatly changed. This conclusion is not necessarily opposed to\r\nthat at which we have just arrived, namely, that lesser changes of\r\nother kinds are advantageous to organic beings. Our present subject is\r\nof some importance, from having an intimate connection with the causes\r\nof variability. Indirectly it perhaps bears on the sterility of species\r\nwhen crossed: for as, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions\r\nof life are favourable to plants and animals, and the crossing of\r\nvarieties adds to the size, vigour, and fertility of their offspring;\r\nso, on the other hand, certain other changes in the conditions of life\r\ncause sterility; and as this likewise ensues from crossing\r\nmuch-modified forms or species, we have a parallel and double series of\r\nfacts, which apparently stand in close relation to each other.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that many animals, though perfectly tamed, refuse to\r\nbreed in captivity. Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire[9] consequently has\r\ndrawn a broad distinction between tamed animals which will not breed\r\nunder captivity, and truly domesticated animals which breed\r\nfreely—generally more freely, as shown in the sixteenth chapter, than\r\nin a state of nature. It is possible and generally easy to tame most\r\nanimals; but experience has shown that it is difficult to get them to\r\nbreed regularly, or even at all. I shall discuss this subject in\r\ndetail; but will give only those cases which seem most illustrative. My\r\nmaterials are derived from notices scattered through various works, and\r\nespecially from a Report, kindly drawn up for me by the officers of the\r\nZoological Society of London, which has especial value, as it records\r\nall the cases, during nine years from 1838-46, in which the animals\r\nwere seen to couple but produced no offspring, as well as the cases in\r\nwhich they never, as far as known, coupled. This MS. Report I have\r\ncorrected by the annual Reports subsequently published up to the year\r\n1865.[10] Many facts are given on the breeding of the animals in that\r\nmagnificent work, ‘Gleanings from the Menageries of Knowsley Hall’ by\r\nDr. Gray. I made, also, particular inquiries from the experienced\r\nkeeper of the birds in the old Surrey Zoological Gardens. I should\r\npremise that a slight change in the treatment of animals sometimes\r\nmakes a great difference in their fertility; and it is probable that\r\nthe results observed in different menageries would differ. Indeed, some\r\nanimals in our Zoological Gardens have become more productive since the\r\nyear 1846. It is, also, manifest from F. Cuvier’s account of the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes[11] that the animals formerly bred much less freely there\r\nthan with us; for instance, in the Duck tribe, which is highly\r\nprolific, only one species had at that period produced young.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable cases, however, are afforded by animals kept in\r\ntheir native country, which, though perfectly tamed, quite healthy, and\r\nallowed some freedom, are absolutely incapable of breeding.\r\nRengger,[12] who in Paraguay particularly attended to this subject,\r\nspecifies six quadrupeds in this condition; and he mentions two or\r\nthree others which most rarely breed. Mr. Bates, in his admirable work\r\non the Amazons, strongly insists on similar cases;[13] and he remarks,\r\nthat the fact of thoroughly tamed native mammals and birds not breeding\r\nwhen kept by the Indians, cannot be wholly accounted for by their\r\nnegligence or indifference, for the turkey and fowl are kept and bred\r\nby various remote tribes. In almost every part of the world—for\r\ninstance, in the interior of Africa, and in several of the Polynesian\r\nislands—the natives are extremely fond of taming the indigenous\r\nquadrupeds and birds; but they rarely or never succeed in getting them\r\nto breed.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious case of an animal not breeding in captivity is that\r\nof the elephant. Elephants are kept in large numbers in their native\r\nIndian home, live to old age, and are vigorous enough for the severest\r\nlabour; yet, with a very few exceptions, they have never been known\r\neven to couple, though both males and females have their proper\r\nperiodical seasons. If, however, we proceed a little eastward to Ava,\r\nwe hear from Mr. Crawfurd[14] that their “breeding in the domestic\r\nstate, or at least in the half-domestic state in which the female\r\nelephants are generally kept, is of everyday occurrence;” and Mr.\r\nCrawfurd informs me that he believes that the difference must be\r\nattributed solely to the females being allowed to roam the forest with\r\nsome degree of freedom. The captive rhinoceros, on the other hand,\r\nseems from Bishop Heber’s account[15] to breed in India far more\r\nreadily than the elephant. Four wild species of the horse genus have\r\nbred in Europe, though here exposed to a great change in their natural\r\nhabits of life; but the species have generally been crossed one with\r\nanother. Most of the members of the pig family breed readily in our\r\nmenageries; even the Red River hog (_Potamochœrus penicillatus_), from\r\nthe sweltering plains of West Africa, has bred twice in the Zoological\r\nGardens. Here also the Peccary (_Dicotyles torquatus_) has bred several\r\ntimes; but another species, the _D. labiatus,_ though rendered so tame\r\nas to be half-domesticated, is said to breed so rarely in its native\r\ncountry of Paraguay, that according to Rengger[16] the fact requires\r\nconfirmation. Mr. Bates remarks that the tapir, though often kept tame\r\nin Amazonia by the Indians, never breeds.\r\n\r\nRuminants generally breed quite freely in England, though brought from\r\nwidely different climates, as may be seen in the Annual Reports of the\r\nZoological Gardens, and in the Gleanings from Lord Derby’s menagerie.\r\n\r\nThe Carnivora, with the exception of the Plantigrade division, breed\r\n(though with capricious exceptions) about half as freely as ruminants.\r\nMany species of Felidae have bred in various menageries, although\r\nimported from diverse climates and closely confined. Mr. Bartlett, the\r\npresent superintendent of the Zoological Gardens[17] remarks that the\r\nlion appears to breed more frequently and to bring forth more young at\r\na birth than any other species of the family. He adds that the tiger\r\nhas rarely bred; “but there are several well-authenticated instances of\r\nthe female tiger breeding with the lion.” Strange as the fact may\r\nappear, many animals under confinement unite with distinct species and\r\nproduce hybrids quite as freely as, or even more freely than, with\r\ntheir own species. On inquiring from Dr. Falconer and others, it\r\nappears that the tiger when confined in India does not breed, though it\r\nhas been known to couple. The chetah (_Felis jubata_) has never been\r\nknown by Mr. Bartlett to breed in England, but it has bred at\r\nFrankfort; nor does it breed in India, where it is kept in large\r\nnumbers for hunting; but no pains would be taken to make them breed, as\r\nonly those animals which have hunted for themselves in a state of\r\nnature are serviceable and worth training.[18] According to Rengger,\r\ntwo species of wild cats in Paraguay, though thoroughly tamed, have\r\nnever bred. Although so many of the Felidae breed readily in the\r\nZoological Gardens, yet conception by no means always follows union: in\r\nthe nine-year Report, various species are specified which were observed\r\nto couple seventy-three times, and no doubt this must have passed many\r\ntimes unnoticed; yet from the seventy- three unions only fifteen births\r\nensued. The Carnivora in the Zoological Gardens were formerly less\r\nfreely exposed to the air and cold than at present, and this change of\r\ntreatment, as I was assured by the former superintendent, Mr. Miller,\r\ngreatly increased their fertility. Mr. Bartlett, and there cannot be a\r\nmore capable judge, says, “it is remarkable that lions breed more\r\nfreely in travelling collections than in the Zoological Gardens;\r\nprobably the constant excitement and irritation produced by moving from\r\nplace to place, or change of air, may have considerable influence in\r\nthe matter.”\r\n\r\nMany members of the Dog family breed readily when confined. The Dhole\r\nis one of the most untamable animals in India, yet a pair kept there by\r\nDr. Falconer produced young. Foxes, on the other hand, rarely breed,\r\nand I have never heard of such an occurrence with the European fox: the\r\nsilver fox of North America (_Canis argentatus_), however, has bred\r\nseveral times in the Zoological Gardens. Even the otter has bred there.\r\nEvery one knows how readily the semi-domesticated ferret breeds, though\r\nshut up in miserably small cages; but other species of Viverra and\r\nParadoxurus absolutely refuse to breed in the Zoological Gardens. The\r\nGenetta has bred both here and in the Jardin des Plantes, and produced\r\nhybrids. The _Herpestes fasciatus_ has likewise bred; but I was\r\nformerly assured that the _H. griseus,_ though many were kept in the\r\nGardens, never bred.\r\n\r\nThe Plantigrade Carnivora breed under confinement much less freely than\r\nother Carnivora, although no reason can be assigned for this fact. In\r\nthe nine-year Report it is stated that the bears had been seen in the\r\nZoological Gardens to couple freely, but previously to 1848 had most\r\nrarely conceived. In the Reports published since this date three\r\nspecies have produced young (hybrids in one case), and, wonderful to\r\nrelate, the white Polar bear has produced young. The badger (_Meles\r\ntaxus_) has bred several times in the Gardens; but I have not heard of\r\nthis occurring elsewhere in England, and the event must be very rare,\r\nfor an instance in Germany has been thought worth recording.[19] In\r\nParaguay the native Nasua, though kept in pairs during many years and\r\nperfectly tamed, has never been known, according to Rengger, to breed\r\nor show any sexual passion; nor, as I hear from Mr. Bates, does this\r\nanimal, or the Cercoleptes, breed in Amazonia. Two other plantigrade\r\ngenera, Procyon and Gulo, though often kept tame in Paraguay, never\r\nbreed there. In the Zoological Gardens species of Nasua and Procyon\r\nhave been seen to couple; but they did not produce young.\r\n\r\nAs domesticated rabbits, guinea-pigs, and white mice breed so\r\nabundantly when closely confined under various climates, it might have\r\nbeen thought that most other members of the Rodent order would have\r\nbred in captivity, but this is not the case. It deserves notice, as\r\nshowing how the capacity to breed sometimes goes by affinity, that the\r\none native rodent of Paraguay, which there breeds _freely_ and has\r\nyielded successive generations, is the _Cavia aperea_; and this animal\r\nis so closely allied to the guinea-pig, that it has been erroneously\r\nthought to be the parent form.[20] In the Zoological Gardens, some\r\nrodents have coupled, but have never produced young; some have neither\r\ncoupled nor bred; but a few have bred, as the porcupine more than once,\r\nthe Barbary mouse, lemming, chinchilla, and agouti (_Dasyprocta aguti_)\r\nseveral times. This latter animal has also produced young in Paraguay,\r\nthough they were born dead and ill-formed; but in Amazonia, according\r\nto Mr. Bates, it never breeds, though often kept tame about the houses.\r\nNor does the paca (_Cœlogenys paca_) breed there. The common hare when\r\nconfined has, I believe, never bred in Europe; though, according to a\r\nrecent statement, it has crossed with the rabbit.[21] I have never\r\nheard of the dormouse breeding in confinement. But squirrels offer a\r\nmore curious case: with one exception, no species has bred in the\r\nZoological Gardens, yet as many as fourteen individuals of _S.\r\npalmarum_ were kept together during several years. The _S. cinera_ has\r\nbeen seen to couple, but it did not produce young; nor has this\r\nspecies, when rendered extremely tame in its native country, North\r\nAmerica, been ever known to breed.[22] At Lord Derby’s menagerie\r\nsquirrels of many kinds were kept in numbers, but Mr. Thompson, the\r\nsuperintendent, told me that none had ever bred there, or elsewhere as\r\nfar as he knew. I have never heard of the English squirrel breeding in\r\nconfinement. But the species which has bred more than once in the\r\nZoological Gardens is the one which perhaps might have been least\r\nexpected, namely, the flying squirrel (_Sciuropterus volucella_): it\r\nhas, also, bred several times near Birmingham; but the female never\r\nproduced more than two young at a birth, whereas in its native American\r\nhome she bears from three to six young.[23]\r\n\r\nMonkeys, in the nine-year Report from the Zoological Gardens, are\r\nstated to unite most freely, but during this period, though many\r\nindividuals were kept, there were only seven births. I have heard of\r\nonly one American monkey, the Ouistiti, breeding in Europe.[24] A\r\nMacacus, according to Flourens, bred in Paris; and more than one\r\nspecies of this genus has produced young in London, especially the\r\n_Macacus rhesus,_ which everywhere shows a special capacity to breed\r\nunder confinement. Hybrids have been produced both in Paris and London\r\nfrom this same genus. The Arabian baboon, or _ Cynocephalus\r\nhamadryas,_[25] and a Cercopithecus have bred in the Zoological\r\nGardens, and the latter species at the Duke of Northumberland’s.\r\nSeveral members of the family of Lemurs have produced hybrids in the\r\nZoological Gardens. It is much more remarkable that monkeys very rarely\r\nbreed when confined in their native country; thus the Cay (_Cebus\r\nazaræ_) is frequently and completely tamed in Paraguay, but Rengger[26]\r\nsays that it breeds so rarely, that he never saw more than two females\r\nwhich had produced young. A similar observation has been made with\r\nrespect to the monkeys which are frequently tamed by the aborigines in\r\nBrazil.[27] In Amazonia, these animals are so often kept in a tame\r\nstate, that Mr. Bates in walking through the streets of Para counted\r\nthirteen species; but, as he asserts, they have never been known to\r\nbreed in captivity.[28]\r\n\r\n      _Birds._\r\n\r\nBirds offer in some respects better evidence than quadrupeds, from\r\ntheir breeding more rapidly and being kept in greater numbers.[29] We\r\nhave seen that carnivorous animals are more fertile under confinement\r\nthan most other mammals. The reverse holds good with carnivorous birds.\r\nIt is said[30] that as many as eighteen species have been used in\r\nEurope for hawking, and several others in Persia and India;[31] they\r\nhave been kept in their native country in the finest condition, and\r\nhave been flown during six, eight, or nine years;[32] yet there is no\r\nrecord of their having ever produced young. As these birds were\r\nformerly caught whilst young, at great expense, being imported from\r\nIceland, Norway, and Sweden, there can be little doubt that, if\r\npossible, they would have been propagated. In the Jardin des Plantes,\r\nno bird of prey has been known to couple.[33] No hawk, vulture, or owl\r\nhas ever produced fertile eggs in the Zoological Gardens, or in the old\r\nSurrey Gardens, with the exception, in the former place on one\r\noccasion, of a condor and a kite (_Milvus niger_). Yet several species,\r\nnamely, the _Aquila fusca, Haliaetus leucocephalus, Falco tinnunculus,\r\nF. subbuteo,_ and _Buteo vulgaris,_ have been seen to couple in the\r\nZoological Gardens. Mr. Morris[34] mentions as a unique fact that a\r\nkestrel (_Falco tinnunculus_) bred in an aviary. The one kind of owl\r\nwhich has been known to couple in the Zoological Gardens was the Eagle\r\nOwl (_Bubo maximus_); and this species shows a special inclination to\r\nbreed in captivity; for a pair at Arundel Castle, kept more nearly in a\r\nstate of nature “than ever fell to the lot of an animal deprived of its\r\nliberty,”[35] actually reared their young. Mr. Gurney has given another\r\ninstance of this same owl breeding in confinement; and he records the\r\ncase of a second species of owl, the _Strix passerina,_ breeding in\r\ncaptivity.[36]\r\n\r\nOf the smaller graminivorous birds, many kinds have been kept tame in\r\ntheir native countries, and have lived long; yet, as the highest\r\nauthority on cage-birds[37] remarks, their propagation is “uncommonly\r\ndifficult.” The canary-bird shows that there is no inherent difficulty\r\nin these birds breeding freely in confinement; and Audubon says[38]\r\nthat the _ Fringilla (Spiza) ciris_ of North America breeds as\r\nperfectly as the canary. The difficulty with the many finches which\r\nhave been kept in confinement is all the more remarkable as more than a\r\ndozen species could be named which have yielded hybrids with the\r\ncanary; but hardly any of these, with the exception of the siskin\r\n(_Fringilla spinus_), have reproduced their own kind. Even the\r\nbullfinch (_Loxia pyrrhula_) has bred as frequently with the canary,\r\nthough belonging to a distinct genus, as with its own species.[39] With\r\nrespect to the skylark (_Alauda arvensis_), I have heard of birds\r\nliving for seven years in an aviary, which never produced young; and a\r\ngreat London bird-fancier assured me that he had never known an\r\ninstance of their breeding; nevertheless one case has been\r\nrecorded.[40] In the nine-year Report from the Zoological Society,\r\ntwenty-four insessorial species are enumerated which had not bred, and\r\nof these only four were known to have coupled.\r\n\r\nParrots are singularly long-lived birds; and Humboldt mentions the\r\ncurious fact of a parrot in South America, which spoke the language of\r\nan extinct Indian tribe, so that this bird preserved the sole relic of\r\na lost language. Even in this country there is reason to believe[41]\r\nthat parrots have lived to the age of nearly one hundred years; yet\r\nthey breed so rarely, though many have been kept in Europe, that the\r\nevent has been thought worth recording in the gravest publications.[42]\r\nNevertheless, when Mr. Buxton turned out a large number of parrots in\r\nNorfolk, three pairs bred and reared ten young birds in the course of\r\ntwo seasons; and this success may be attributed to their free life.[43]\r\nAccording to Bechstein[44] the African _Psittacus erithacus_ breeds\r\noftener than any other species in Germany: the _P. macoa_ occasionally\r\nlays fertile eggs, but rarely succeeds in hatching them; this bird,\r\nhowever, has the instinct of incubation sometimes so strongly\r\ndeveloped, that it will hatch the eggs of fowls or pigeons. In the\r\nZoological Gardens and in the old Surrey Gardens some few species have\r\ncoupled, but, with the exception of three species of parakeets, none\r\nhave bred. It is a much more remarkable fact that in Guiana parrots of\r\ntwo kinds, as I am informed by Sir R. Schomburgk, are often taken from\r\nthe nests by the Indians and reared in large numbers; they are so tame\r\nthat they fly freely about the houses, and come when called to be fed,\r\nlike pigeons; yet he has never heard of a single instance of their\r\nbreeding.[45] In Jamaica, a resident naturalist, Mr. R. Hill,[46] says,\r\n“no birds more readily submit to human dependence than the\r\nparrot-tribe, but no instance of a parrot breeding in this tame life\r\nhas been known yet.” Mr. Hill specifies a number of other native birds\r\nkept tame in the West Indies, which never breed in this state.\r\n\r\nThe great pigeon family offers a striking contrast with the parrots: in\r\nthe nine-year Report thirteen species are recorded as having bred, and,\r\nwhat is more noticeable, only two were seen to couple without any\r\nresult. Since the above date every annual Report gives many cases of\r\nvarious pigeons breeding. The two magnificent crowned pigeons (_Goura\r\ncoronata_ and _ victoriæ_) produced hybrids; nevertheless, of the\r\nformer species more than a dozen birds were kept, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Crawfurd, in a park at Penang, under a perfectly well-adapted\r\nclimate, but never once bred. The _Columba migratoria_ in its native\r\ncountry, North America, invariably lays two eggs, but in Lord Derby’s\r\nmenagerie never more than one. The same fact has been observed with the\r\n_C. leucocephala._[47]\r\n\r\nGallinaceous birds of many genera likewise show an eminent capacity for\r\nbreeding under captivity. This is particularly the case with pheasants,\r\nyet our English species seldom lays more than ten eggs in confinement;\r\nwhilst from eighteen to twenty is the usual number in the wild\r\nstate.[48] With the Gallinaceæ, as with all other orders, there are\r\nmarked and inexplicable exceptions in regard to the fertility of\r\ncertain species and genera under confinement. Although many trials have\r\nbeen made with the common partridge, it has rarely bred, even when\r\nreared in large aviaries; and the hen will never hatch her own\r\neggs.[49] The American tribe of Guans or Cracidæ are tamed with\r\nremarkable ease, but are very shy breeders in this country;[50] but\r\nwith care various species were formerly made to breed rather freely in\r\nHolland.[51] Birds of this tribe are often kept in a perfectly tamed\r\ncondition in their native country by the Indians, but they never\r\nbreed.[52] It might have been expected that grouse from their habits of\r\nlife would not have bred in captivity, more especially as they are said\r\nsoon to languish and die.[53] But many cases are recorded of their\r\nbreeding: the capercailzie (_Tetrao urogallus_) has bred in the\r\nZoological Gardens; it breeds without much difficulty when confined in\r\nNorway, and in Russia five successive generations have been reared:\r\n_Tetrao tetrix_ has likewise bred in Norway; _ T. scoticus_ in Ireland;\r\n_T. umbellus_ at Lord Derby’s; and _T. cupido_ in North America.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to imagine a greater change in habits than that\r\nwhich the members of the ostrich family must suffer, when cooped up in\r\nsmall enclosures under a temperate climate, after freely roaming over\r\ndesert and tropical plains or entangled forests; yet almost all the\r\nkinds have frequently produced young in the various European\r\nmenageries, even the mooruk (_Casuarius bennetii_) from New Ireland.\r\nThe African ostrich, though perfectly healthy and living long in the\r\nSouth of France, never lays more than from twelve to fifteen eggs,\r\nthough in its native country it lays from twenty-five to thirty.[54]\r\nHere we have another instance of fertility impaired, but not lost,\r\nunder confinement, as with the flying squirrel, the hen-pheasant, and\r\ntwo species of American pigeons.\r\n\r\nMost Waders can be tamed, as the Rev. E. S. Dixon informs me, with\r\nremarkable facility; but several of them are short-lived under\r\nconfinement, so that their sterility in this state is not surprising.\r\nThe cranes breed more readily than other genera: _Grus montigresia_ has\r\nbred several times in Paris and in the Zoological Gardens, as has _G.\r\ncinerea_ at the latter place, and _G. antigone_ at Calcutta. Of other\r\nmembers of this great order, _Tetrapteryx paradisea_ has bred at\r\nKnowsley, a Porphyrio in Sicily, and the _Gallinula chloropus_ in the\r\nZoological Gardens. On the other hand, several birds belonging to this\r\norder will not breed in their native country, Jamaica; and the Psophia,\r\nthough often kept by the Indians of Guiana about their houses, “is\r\nseldom or never known to breed.”[55]\r\n\r\nThe members of the great Duck family breed as readily in confinement as\r\ndo the Columbæ and Gallinæ and this, considering their aquatic and\r\nwandering habits, and the nature of their food, could not have been\r\nanticipated. Even some time ago above two dozen species had bred in the\r\nZoological Gardens; and M. Selys-Longchamps has recorded the production\r\nof hybrids from forty-four different members of the family; and to\r\nthese Professor Newton has added a few more cases.[56] “There is not,”\r\nsays Mr. Dixon,[57] “in the wide world, a goose which is not in the\r\nstrict sense of the word domesticable;” that is, capable of breeding\r\nunder confinement; but this statement is probably too bold. The\r\ncapacity to breed sometimes varies in individuals of the same species;\r\nthus Audubon[58] kept for more than eight years some wild geese (_Anser\r\ncanadensis_), but they would not mate; whilst other individuals of the\r\nsame species produced young during the second year. I know of but one\r\ninstance in the whole family of a species which absolutely refuses to\r\nbreed in captivity, namely, the _Dendrocygna viduata,_ although,\r\naccording to Sir R. Schomburgk,[59] it is easily tamed, and is\r\nfrequently kept by the Indians of Guiana. Lastly, with respect to\r\nGulls, though many have been kept in the Zoological Gardens and in the\r\nold Surrey Gardens, no instance was known before the year 1848 of their\r\ncoupling or breeding; but since that period the herring gull (_Larus\r\nargentatus_) has bred many times in the Zoological Gardens and at\r\nKnowsley.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that insects are affected by confinement\r\nlike the higher animals. It is well known that the Sphingidae rarely\r\nbreed when thus treated. An entomologist[60] in Paris kept twenty-five\r\nspecimens of _Saturnia pyri,_ but did not succeed in getting a single\r\nfertile egg. A number of females of _Orthosia munda_ and of _Mamestra\r\nsuasa_ reared in confinement were unattractive to the males.[61] Mr.\r\nNewport kept nearly a hundred individuals of two species of Vanessa,\r\nbut not one paired; this, however, might have been due to their habit\r\nof coupling on the wing.[62] Mr. Atkinson could never succeed in India\r\nin making the Tarroo silk-moth breed in confinement.[63] It appears\r\nthat a number of moths, especially the Sphingidae, when hatched in the\r\nautumn out of their proper season, are completely barren; but this\r\nlatter case is still involved in some obscurity.[64]\r\n\r\nIndependently of the fact of many animals under confinement not\r\ncoupling, or, if they couple, not producing young, there is evidence of\r\nanother kind that their sexual functions are disturbed. For many cases\r\nhave been recorded of the loss by male birds when confined of their\r\ncharacteristic plumage. Thus the common linnet (_Linota cannabina_)\r\nwhen caged does not acquire the fine crimson colour on its breast, and\r\none of the buntings (_Emberiza passerina_) loses the black on its head.\r\nA Pyrrhula and an Oriolus have been observed to assume the quiet\r\nplumage of the hen-bird; and the _Falco albidus_ returned to the dress\r\nof an earlier age.[65] Mr. Thompson, the superintendent of the Knowsley\r\nmenagerie, informed me that he had often observed analogous facts. The\r\nhorns of a male deer (_Cervus canadensis_) during the voyage from\r\nAmerica were badly developed; but subsequently in Paris perfect horns\r\nwere produced.\r\n\r\nWhen conception takes place under confinement, the young are often born\r\ndead, or die soon, or are ill-formed. This frequently occurs in the\r\nZoological Gardens, and, according to Rengger, with native animals\r\nconfined in Paraguay. The mother’s milk often fails. We may also\r\nattribute to the disturbance of the sexual functions the frequent\r\noccurrence of that monstrous instinct which leads the mother to devour\r\nher own offspring,—a mysterious case of perversion, as it at first\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nSufficient evidence has now been advanced to prove that animals when\r\nfirst confined are eminently liable to suffer in their reproductive\r\nsystems. We feel at first naturally inclined to attribute the result to\r\nloss of health, or at least to loss of vigour; but this view can hardly\r\nbe admitted when we reflect how healthy, long-lived, and vigorous many\r\nanimals are under captivity, such as parrots, and hawks when used for\r\nhawking, cheetahs when used for hunting, and elephants. The\r\nreproductive organs themselves are not diseased; and the diseases, from\r\nwhich animals in menageries usually perish, are not those which in any\r\nway affect their fertility. No domestic animal is more subject to\r\ndisease than the sheep, yet it is remarkably prolific. The failure of\r\nanimals to breed under confinement has been sometimes attributed\r\nexclusively to a failure in their sexual instincts: this may\r\noccasionally come into play, but there is no obvious reason why this\r\ninstinct should be especially liable to be affected with perfectly\r\ntamed animals, except, indeed, indirectly through the reproductive\r\nsystem itself being disturbed. Moreover, numerous cases have been given\r\nof various animals which couple freely under confinement, but never\r\nconceive; or, if they conceive and produce young, these are fewer in\r\nnumber than is natural to the species. In the vegetable kingdom\r\ninstinct of course can play no part; and we shall presently see that\r\nplants when removed from their natural conditions are affected in\r\nnearly the same manner as animals. Change of climate cannot be the\r\ncause of the loss of fertility, for, whilst many animals imported into\r\nEurope from extremely different climates breed freely, many others when\r\nconfined in their native land are completely sterile. Change of food\r\ncannot be the chief cause; for ostriches, ducks, and many other\r\nanimals, which must have undergone a great change in this respect,\r\nbreed freely. Carnivorous birds when confined are extremely sterile,\r\nwhilst most carnivorous mammals, except plantigrades, are moderately\r\nfertile. Nor can the amount of food be the cause; for a sufficient\r\nsupply will certainly be given to valuable animals; and there is no\r\nreason to suppose that much more food would be given to them than to\r\nour choice domestic productions which retain their full fertility.\r\nLastly, we may infer from the case of the elephant, cheetah, various\r\nhawks, and of many animals which are allowed to lead an almost free\r\nlife in their native land, that want of exercise is not the sole cause.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that any change in the habits of life, whatever these\r\nhabits may be, if great enough, tends to affect in an inexplicable\r\nmanner the powers of reproduction. The result depends more on the\r\nconstitution of the species than on the nature of the change; for\r\ncertain whole groups are affected more than others; but exceptions\r\nalways occur, for some species in the most fertile groups refuse to\r\nbreed, and some in the most sterile groups breed freely. Those animals\r\nwhich usually breed freely under confinement, rarely breed, as I was\r\nassured, in the Zoological Gardens, within a year or two after their\r\nfirst importation. When an animal which is generally sterile under\r\nconfinement happens to breed, the young apparently do not inherit this\r\npower: for had this been the case, various quadrupeds and birds, which\r\nare valuable for exhibition, would have become common. Dr. Broca even\r\naffirms[66] that many animals in the Jardin des Plantes, after having\r\nproduced young for three or four successive generations, become\r\nsterile; but this may be the result of too close interbreeding. It is a\r\nremarkable circumstance that many mammals and birds have produced\r\nhybrids under confinement quite as readily as, or even more readily\r\nthan, they have procreated their own kind. Of this fact many instances\r\nhave been given;[67] and we are thus reminded of those plants which\r\nwhen cultivated refuse to be fertilised by their own pollen, but can\r\neasily be fertilised by that of a distinct species. Finally, we must\r\nconclude, limited as the conclusion is, that changed conditions of life\r\nhave an especial power of acting injuriously on the reproductive\r\nsystem. The whole case is quite peculiar, for these organs, though not\r\ndiseased, are thus rendered incapable of performing their proper\r\nfunctions, or perform them imperfectly.\r\n\r\n_Sterility of Domesticated Animals from changed conditions._—With\r\nrespect to domesticated animals, as their domestication mainly depends\r\non the accident of their breeding freely under captivity, we ought not\r\nto expect that their reproductive system would be affected by any\r\nmoderate degree of change. Those orders of quadrupeds and birds, of\r\nwhich the wild species breed most readily in our menageries, have\r\nafforded us the greatest number of domesticated productions. Savages in\r\nmost parts of the world are fond of taming animals;[68] and if any of\r\nthese regularly produced young, and were at the same time useful, they\r\nwould be at once domesticated. If, when their masters migrated into\r\nother countries, they were in addition found capable of withstanding\r\nvarious climates, they would be still more valuable; and it appears\r\nthat the animals which breed readily in captivity can generally\r\nwithstand different climates. Some few domesticated animals, such as\r\nthe reindeer and camel, offer an exception to this rule. Many of our\r\ndomesticated animals can bear with undiminished fertility the most\r\nunnatural conditions; for instance, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and ferrets\r\nbreed in miserably confined hutches. Few European dogs of any kind\r\nwithstand the climate of India without degenerating, but as long as\r\nthey survive, they retain, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, their\r\nfertility; so it is, according to Dr. Daniell, with English dogs taken\r\nto Sierra Leone. The fowl, a native of the hot jungles of India,\r\nbecomes more fertile than its parent-stock in every quarter of the\r\nworld, until we advance as far north as Greenland and Northern Siberia,\r\nwhere this bird will not breed. Both fowls and pigeons, which I\r\nreceived during the autumn direct from Sierra Leone, were at once ready\r\nto couple.[69] I have, also, seen pigeons breeding as freely as the\r\ncommon kinds within a year after their importation from the upper Nile.\r\nThe guinea- fowl, an aboriginal of the hot and dry deserts of Africa,\r\nwhilst living under our damp and cool climate, produces a large supply\r\nof eggs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, our domesticated animals under new conditions\r\noccasionally show signs of lessened fertility. Roulin asserts that in\r\nthe hot valleys of the equatorial Cordillera sheep are not fully\r\nfecund;[70] and according to Lord Somerville[71] the merino-sheep which\r\nhe imported from Spain were not at first perfectly fertile, it is\r\nsaid[72] that mares brought up on dry food in the stable, and turned\r\nout to grass, do not at first breed. The peahen, as we have seen, is\r\nsaid not to lay so many eggs in England as in India. It was long before\r\nthe canary-bird was fully fertile, and even now first-rate breeding\r\nbirds are not common.[73] In the hot and dry province of Delhi, as I\r\nhear from Dr. Falconer, the eggs of the turkey, though placed under a\r\nhen, are extremely liable to fail. According to Roulin, geese taken to\r\nthe lofty plateau of Bogota, at first laid seldom, and then only a few\r\neggs; of these scarcely a fourth were hatched, and half the young birds\r\ndied; in the second generation they were more fertile; and when Roulin\r\nwrote they were becoming as fertile as our geese in Europe. With\r\nrespect to the valley of Quito, Mr. Orton says[74] “the only geese in\r\nthe valley are a few imported from Europe, and these refuse to\r\npropagate.” In the Philippine Archipelago the goose, it is asserted,\r\nwill not breed or even lay eggs.[75] A more curious case is that of the\r\nfowl, which, according to Roulin, when first introduced would not breed\r\nat Cusco in Bolivia, but subsequently became quite fertile; and the\r\nEnglish Game fowl, lately introduced, had not as yet arrived at its\r\nfull fertility, for to raise two or three chickens from a nest of eggs\r\nwas thought fortunate. In Europe close confinement has a marked effect\r\non the fertility of the fowl: it has been found in France that with\r\nfowls allowed considerable freedom only twenty per cent of the eggs\r\nfailed; when allowed less freedom forty per cent failed; and in close\r\nconfinement sixty out of the hundred were not hatched.[76] So we see\r\nthat unnatural and changed conditions of life produce some effect on\r\nthe fertility of our most thoroughly domesticated animals, in the same\r\nmanner, though in a far less degree, as with captive wild animals.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means rare to find certain males and females which will not\r\nbreed together, though both are known to be perfectly fertile with\r\nother males and females. We have no reason to suppose that this is\r\ncaused by these animals having been subjected to any change in their\r\nhabits of life; therefore such cases are hardly related to our present\r\nsubject. The cause apparently lies in an innate sexual incompatibility\r\nof the pair which are matched. Several instances have been communicated\r\nto me by Mr. W. C. Spooner (well known for his essay on\r\nCross-breeding), by Mr. Eyton of Eyton, by Mr. Wicksted and other\r\nbreeders, and especially by Mr. Waring of Chelsfield, in relation to\r\nhorses, cattle, pigs, foxhounds, other dogs, and pigeons.[77] In these\r\ncases, females, which either previously or subsequently were proved to\r\nbe fertile, failed to breed with certain males, with whom it was\r\nparticularly desired to match them. A change in the constitution of the\r\nfemale may sometimes have occurred before she was put to the second\r\nmale; but in other cases this explanation is hardly tenable, for a\r\nfemale, known not to be barren, has been unsuccessfully paired seven or\r\neight times with the same male likewise known to be perfectly fertile.\r\nWith cart-mares, which sometimes will not breed with stallions of pure\r\nblood, but subsequently have bred with cart-stallions, Mr. Spooner is\r\ninclined to attribute the failure to the lesser sexual power of the\r\nracehorse. But I have heard from the greatest breeder of racehorses at\r\nthe present day, through Mr. Waring, that “it frequently occurs with a\r\nmare to be put several times during one or two seasons to a particular\r\nstallion of acknowledged power, and yet prove barren; the mare\r\nafterwards breeding at once with some other horse.” These facts are\r\nworth recording, as they show, like so many previous facts, on what\r\nslight constitutional differences the fertility of an animal often\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\n      _Sterility of Plants from changed Conditions of Life, and from\r\n      other causes._\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom cases of sterility frequently occur, analogous\r\nwith those previously given in the animal kingdom. But the subject is\r\nobscured by several circumstances, presently to be discussed, namely,\r\nthe contabescence of the anthers, as Gärtner has named a certain\r\naffection—monstrosities—doubleness of the flower—much-enlarged\r\nfruit—and long-continued or excessive propagation by buds.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that many plants in our gardens and hot-houses, though\r\npreserved in the most perfect health, rarely or never produce seed. I\r\ndo not allude to plants which run to leaves, from being kept too damp,\r\nor too warm, or too much manured; for these do not flower, and the case\r\nmay be wholly different. Nor do I allude to fruit not ripening from\r\nwant of heat or rotting from too much moisture. But many exotic plants,\r\nwith their ovules and pollen appearing perfectly sound, will not set\r\nany seed. The sterility in many cases, as I know from my own\r\nobservation, is simply due to the absence of the proper insects for\r\ncarrying the pollen to the stigma. But after excluding the several\r\ncases just specified, there are many plants in which the reproductive\r\nsystem has been seriously affected by the altered conditions of life to\r\nwhich they have been subjected.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to enter on many details. Linnæus long ago\r\nobserved[78] that Alpine plants, although naturally loaded with seed,\r\nproduce either few or none when cultivated in gardens. But exceptions\r\noften occur: the _Draba sylvestris,_ one of our most thoroughly Alpine\r\nplants, multiplies itself by seed in Mr. H. C. Watson’s garden, near\r\nLondon; and Kerner, who has particularly attended to the cultivation of\r\nAlpine plants, found that various kinds, when cultivated, spontaneously\r\nsowed themselves.[79] Many plants which naturally grow in peat-earth\r\nare entirely sterile in our gardens. I have noticed the same fact with\r\nseveral liliaceous plants, which nevertheless grew vigorously.\r\n\r\nToo much manure renders some kinds utterly sterile, as I have myself\r\nobserved. The tendency to sterility from this cause runs in families;\r\nthus, according to Gärtner,[80] it is hardly possible to give too much\r\nmanure to most Gramineæ, Cruciferæ, and Leguminosæ, whilst succulent\r\nand bulbous-rooted plants are easily affected. Extreme poverty of soil\r\nis less apt to induce sterility; but dwarfed plants of _Trifolium\r\nminus_ and _repens,_ growing on a lawn often mown and never manured,\r\nwere found by me not to produce any seed. The temperature of the soil,\r\nand the season at which plants are watered, often have a marked effect\r\non their fertility, as was observed by Kölreuter in the case of\r\nMirabilis.[81] Mr. Scott, in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh, observed\r\nthat _Oncidium divaricatum_ would not set seed when grown in a basket\r\nin which it throve, but was capable of fertilisation in a pot where it\r\nwas a little damper. _Pelargonium fulgidum,_ for many years after its\r\nintroduction, seeded freely; it then became sterile; now it is\r\nfertile[82] if kept in a dry stove during the winter. Other varieties\r\nof pelargonium are sterile and others fertile without our being able to\r\nassign any cause. Very slight changes in the position of a plant,\r\nwhether planted on a bank or at its base, sometimes make all the\r\ndifference in its producing seed. Temperature apparently has a much\r\nmore powerful influence on the fertility of plants than on that of\r\nanimals. Nevertheless it is wonderful what changes some few plants will\r\nwithstand with undiminished fertility: thus the _Zephyranthes candida,_\r\na native of the moderately warm banks of the Plata, sows itself in the\r\nhot dry country near Lima, and in Yorkshire resists the severest\r\nfrosts, and I have seen seeds gathered from pods which had been covered\r\nwith snow during three weeks.[83] _Berberis wallichii,_ from the hot\r\nKhasia range in India, is uninjured by our sharpest frosts, and ripens\r\nits fruit under our cool summers. Nevertheless, I presume we must\r\nattribute to change of climate the sterility of many foreign plants;\r\nthus, the Persian and Chinese lilacs (_Syringa persica_ and\r\n_chinensis_), though perfectly hardy here, never produce a seed; the\r\ncommon lilac (_S. vulgaris_) seeds with us moderately well, but in\r\nparts of Germany the capsules never contain seed.[84] Some few of the\r\ncases, given in the last chapter, of self-impotent plants, might have\r\nbeen here introduced, as their state seems due to the conditions to\r\nwhich they have been subjected.\r\n\r\nThe liability of plants to be affected in their fertility by slightly\r\nchanged conditions is the more remarkable, as the pollen when once in\r\nprocess of formation is not easily injured; a plant may be\r\ntransplanted, or a branch with flower-buds be cut off and placed in\r\nwater, and the pollen will be matured. Pollen, also, when once mature,\r\nmay be kept for weeks or even months.[85] The female organs are more\r\nsensitive, for Gärtner[86] found that dicotyledonous plants, when\r\ncarefully removed so that they did not in the least flag, could seldom\r\nbe fertilised; this occurred even with potted plants if the roots had\r\ngrown out of the hole at the bottom. In some few cases, however, as\r\nwith Digitalis, transplantation did not prevent fertilisation; and\r\naccording to the testimony of Mawz, _Brassica rapa,_ when pulled up by\r\nits roots and placed in water, ripened its seed. Flower-stems of\r\nseveral monocotyledonous plants when cut off and placed in water\r\nlikewise produce seed. But in these cases I presume that the flowers\r\nhad been already fertilised, for Herbert[87] found with the Crocus that\r\nthe plants might be removed or mutilated after the act of\r\nfertilisation, and would still perfect their seeds; but that, if\r\ntransplanted before being fertilised, the application of pollen was\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\nPlants which have been long cultivated can generally endure with\r\nundiminished fertility various and great changes; but not in most cases\r\nso great a change of climate as domesticated animals. It is remarkable\r\nthat many plants under these circumstances are so much affected that\r\nthe proportion and the nature of their chemical ingredients are\r\nmodified, yet their fertility is unimpaired. Thus, as Dr. Falconer\r\ninforms me, there is a great difference in the character of the fibre\r\nin hemp, in the quantity of oil in the seed of the Linum, in the\r\nproportion of narcotin to morphine in the poppy, in gluten to starch in\r\nwheat, when these plants are cultivated on the plains and on the\r\nmountains of India; nevertheless, they all remain fully fertile.\r\n\r\n_Contabescence._—Gärtner has designated by this term a peculiar\r\ncondition of the anthers in certain plants, in which they are\r\nshrivelled, or become brown and tough, and contain no good pollen. When\r\nin this state they exactly resemble the anthers of the most sterile\r\nhybrids. Gärtner,[88] in his discussion on this subject, has shown that\r\nplants of many orders are occasionally thus affected; but the\r\nCaryophyllaceæ and Liliaceæ suffer most, and to these orders, I think,\r\nthe Ericaceæ may be added. Contabescence varies in degree, but on the\r\nsame plant all the flowers are generally affected to nearly the same\r\nextent. The anthers are affected at a very early period in the\r\nflower-bud, and remain in the same state (with one recorded exception)\r\nduring the life of the plant. The affection cannot be cured by any\r\nchange of treatment, and is propagated by layers, cuttings, etc., and\r\nperhaps even by seed. In contabescent plants the female organs are\r\nseldom affected, or merely become precocious in their development. The\r\ncause of this affection is doubtful, and is different in different\r\ncases. Until I read Gärtner’s discussion I attributed it, as apparently\r\ndid Herbert, to the unnatural treatment of the plants; but its\r\npermanence under changed conditions, and the female organs not being\r\naffected, seem incompatible with this view. The fact of several endemic\r\nplants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems, at first sight,\r\nequally incompatible with this view; but Kölreuter believes that this\r\nis the result of their transplantation. The contabescent plants of\r\nDianthus and Verbascum, found wild by Wiegmann, grew on a dry and\r\nsterile bank. The fact that exotic plants are eminently liable to this\r\naffection also seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their\r\nunnatural treatment. In some instances, as with Silene, Gärtner’s view\r\nseems the most probable, namely, that it is caused by an inherent\r\ntendency in the species to become dioecious. I can add another cause,\r\nnamely, the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants, for I have\r\nobserved seedlings of three species of Primula and of _ Lythrum\r\nsalicaria,_ which had been raised from plants illegitimately fertilised\r\nby their own-form pollen, with some or all their anthers in a\r\ncontabescent state. There is perhaps an additional cause, namely,\r\nself-fertilisation; for many plants of Dianthus and Lobelia, which had\r\nbeen raised from self-fertilised seeds, had their anthers in this\r\nstate; but these instances are not conclusive, as both genera are\r\nliable from other causes to this affection.\r\n\r\nCases of an opposite nature likewise occur, namely, plants with the\r\nfemale organs struck with sterility, whilst the male organs remain\r\nperfect. _Dianthus japonicus,_ a Passiflora, and Nicotiana, have been\r\ndescribed by Gärtner[89] as being in this unusual condition.\r\n\r\n_Monstrosities as a cause of sterility._—Great deviations of structure,\r\neven when the reproductive organs themselves are not seriously\r\naffected, sometimes cause plants to become sterile. But in other cases\r\nplants may become monstrous to an extreme degree and yet retain their\r\nfull fertility. Gallesio, who certainly had great experience,[90] often\r\nattributes sterility to this cause; but it may be suspected that in\r\nsome of his cases sterility was the cause, and not the result, of the\r\nmonstrous growths. The curious St. Valery apple, although it bears\r\nfruit, rarely produces seed. The wonderfully anomalous flowers of\r\n_Begonia frigida,_ formerly described, though they appear fit for\r\nfructification, are sterile.[91] Species of Primula in which the calyx\r\nis brightly coloured are said[92] to be often sterile, though I have\r\nknown them to be fertile. On the other hand, Verlot gives several cases\r\nof proliferous flowers which can be propagated by seed. This was the\r\ncase with a poppy, which had become monopetalous by the union of its\r\npetals.[93] Another extraordinary poppy, with the stamens replaced by\r\nnumerous small supplementary capsules, likewise reproduces itself by\r\nseed. This has also occurred with a plant of _Saxifraga geum,_ in which\r\na series of adventitious carpels, bearing ovules on their margins, had\r\nbeen developed between the stamens and the normal carpels[94] Lastly,\r\nwith respect to peloric flowers, which depart wonderfully from the\r\nnatural structure,—those of _Linaria vulgaris_ seem generally to be\r\nmore or less sterile, whilst those before described of _ Antirrhinum\r\nmajus,_ when artificially fertilised with their own pollen, are\r\nperfectly fertile, though sterile when left to themselves, for bees are\r\nunable to crawl into the narrow tubular flower. The peloric flowers of\r\n_Corydalis solida,_ according to Godron,[95] are sometimes barren and\r\nsometimes fertile; whilst those of Gloxinia are well known to yield\r\nplenty of seed. In our greenhouse Pelargoniums, the central flower of\r\nthe truss is often peloric, and Mr. Masters informs me that he tried in\r\nvain during several years to get seed from these flowers. I likewise\r\nmade many vain attempts, but sometimes succeeded in fertilising them\r\nwith pollen from a normal flower of another variety; and conversely I\r\nseveral times fertilised ordinary flowers with peloric pollen. Only\r\nonce I succeeded in raising a plant from a peloric flower fertilised by\r\npollen from a peloric flower borne by another variety; but the plant,\r\nit may be added, presented nothing particular in its structure. Hence\r\nwe may conclude that no general rule can be laid down; but any great\r\ndeviation from the normal structure, even when the reproductive organs\r\nthemselves are not seriously affected, certainly often leads to sexual\r\nimpotence.\r\n\r\n_Double Flowers._—When the stamens are converted into petals, the plant\r\nbecomes on the male side sterile; when both stamens and pistils are\r\nthus changed, the plant becomes completely barren. Symmetrical flowers\r\nhaving numerous stamens and petals are the most liable to become\r\ndouble, as perhaps follows from all multiple organs being the most\r\nsubject to variability. But flowers furnished with only a few stamens,\r\nand others which are asymmetrical in structure, sometimes become\r\ndouble, as we see with the double gorse or Ulex, and Antirrhinum. The\r\nCompositæ bear what are called double flowers by the abnormal\r\ndevelopment of the corolla of their central florets. Doubleness is\r\nsometimes connected with prolification,[96] or the continued growth of\r\nthe axis of the flower. Doubleness is strongly inherited. No one has\r\nproduced, as Lindley remarks,[97] double flowers by promoting the\r\nperfect health of the plant. On the contrary, unnatural conditions of\r\nlife favour their production. There is some reason to believe that\r\nseeds kept during many years, and seeds believed to be imperfectly\r\nfertilised, yield double flowers more freely than fresh and perfectly\r\nfertilised seed.[98] Long-continued cultivation in rich soil seems to\r\nbe the commonest exciting cause. A double narcissus and a double\r\n_Anthemis nobilis,_ transplanted into very poor soil, has been observed\r\nto become single;[99] and I have seen a completely double white\r\nprimrose rendered permanently single by being divided and transplanted\r\nwhilst in full flower. It has been observed by Professor E. Morren that\r\ndoubleness of the flowers and variegation of the leaves are\r\nantagonistic states; but so many exceptions to the rule have lately\r\nbeen recorded,[100] that, though general, it cannot be looked at as\r\ninvariable. Variegation seems generally to result from a feeble or\r\natrophied condition of the plant, and a large proportion of the\r\nseedlings raised from parents, if both are variegated, usually perish\r\nat an early age; hence we may perhaps infer that doubleness, which is\r\nthe antagonistic state, commonly arises from a plethoric condition. On\r\nthe other hand, extremely poor soil sometimes, though rarely, appears\r\nto cause doubleness: I formerly described[101] some completely double,\r\nbud-like, flowers produced in large numbers by stunted wild plants of\r\n_Gentiana amarella_ growing on a poor chalky bank. I have also noticed\r\na distinct tendency to doubleness in the flowers of a Ranunculus,\r\nHorse-chestnut, and Bladder-nut (_Ranunculus repens, Aesculus pavia,_\r\nand _Staphylea_), growing under very unfavourable conditions. Professor\r\nLehmann[102] found several wild plants growing near a hot spring with\r\ndouble flowers. With respect to the cause of doubleness, which arises,\r\nas we see, under widely different circumstances, I shall presently\r\nattempt to show that the most probable view is that unnatural\r\nconditions first give a tendency to sterility, and that then, on the\r\nprinciple of compensation, as the reproductive organs do not perform\r\ntheir proper functions, they either become developed into petals, or\r\nadditional petals are formed. This view has lately been supported by\r\nMr. Laxton[103] who advances the case of some common peas, which, after\r\nlong-continued heavy rain, flowered a second time, and produced double\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n_Seedless Fruit._—Many of our most valuable fruits, although consisting\r\nin a homological sense of widely different organs, are either quite\r\nsterile, or produce extremely few seeds. This is notoriously the case\r\nwith our best pears, grapes, and figs, with the pine-apple, banana,\r\nbread-fruit, pomegranate, azarole, date-palms, and some members of the\r\norange-tribe. Poorer varieties of these same fruits either habitually\r\nor occasionally yield seed.[104] Most horticulturists look at the great\r\nsize and anomalous development of the fruit as the cause, and sterility\r\nas the result; but the opposite view, as we shall presently see, is\r\nmore probable.\r\n\r\n_Sterility from the excessive development of the organs of Growth or\r\nVegetation._—Plants which from any cause grow too luxuriantly, and\r\nproduce leaves, stems, runners, suckers, tubers, bulbs, etc., in\r\nexcess, sometimes do not flower, or if they flower do not yield seed.\r\nTo make European vegetables under the hot climate of India yield seed,\r\nit is necessary to check their growth; and, when one-third grown, they\r\nare taken up, and their stems and tap-roots are cut or mutilated.[105]\r\nSo it is with hybrids; for instance, Prof. Lecoq[106] had three plants\r\nof Mirabilis, which, though they grew luxuriantly and flowered, were\r\nquite sterile; but after beating one with a stick until a few branches\r\nalone were left, these at once yielded good seed. The sugar-cane, which\r\ngrows vigorously and produces a large supply of succulent stems, never,\r\naccording to various observers, bears seed in the West Indies, Malaga,\r\nIndia, Cochin China, Mauritius, or the Malay Archipelago.[107] Plants\r\nwhich produce a large number of tubers are apt to be sterile, as\r\noccurs, to a certain extent, with the common potato; and Mr. Fortune\r\ninforms me that the sweet potato (_Convolvulus batatas_) in China\r\nnever, as far as he has seen, yields seed. Dr. Royle remarks[108] that\r\nin India the _Agave vivipara,_ when grown in rich soil, invariably\r\nproduces bulbs, but no seeds; whilst a poor soil and dry climate lead\r\nto an opposite result. In China, according to Mr. Fortune, an\r\nextraordinary number of little bulbs are developed in the axils of the\r\nleaves of the yam, and this plant does not bear seed. Whether in these\r\ncases, as in those of double flowers and seedless fruit, sexual\r\nsterility from changed conditions of life is the primary cause which\r\nleads to the excessive development of the organs of vegetation, is\r\ndoubtful; though some evidence might be advanced in favour of this\r\nview. It is perhaps a more probable view that plants which propagate\r\nthemselves largely by one method, namely by buds, have not sufficient\r\nvital power or organised matter for the other method of sexual\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nSeveral distinguished botanists and good practical judges believe that\r\nlong- continued propagation by cuttings, runners, tubers, bulbs, etc.,\r\nindependently of any excessive development of these parts, is the cause\r\nof many plants failing to produce flowers, or producing only barren\r\nflowers,—it is as if they had lost the habit of sexual generation.[109]\r\nThat many plants when thus propagated are sterile there can be no\r\ndoubt, but as to whether the long continuance of this form of\r\npropagation is the actual cause of their sterility, I will not venture,\r\nfrom the want of sufficient evidence, to express an opinion.\r\n\r\nThat plants may be propagated for long periods by buds, without the aid\r\nof sexual generation, we may safely infer from this being the case with\r\nmany plants which must have long survived in a state of nature. As I\r\nhave had occasion before to allude to this subject, I will here give\r\nsuch cases as I have collected. Many alpine plants ascend mountains\r\nbeyond the height at which they can produce seed.[110] Certain species\r\nof Poa and Festuca, when growing on mountain-pastures, propagate\r\nthemselves, as I hear from Mr. Bentham, almost exclusively by bulblets.\r\nKalm gives a more curious instance[111] of several American trees,\r\nwhich grow so plentifully in marshes or in thick woods, that they are\r\ncertainly well adapted for these stations, yet scarcely ever produce\r\nseeds; but when accidentally growing on the outside of the marsh or\r\nwood, are loaded with seed. The common ivy is found in Northern Sweden\r\nand Russia, but flowers and fruits only in the southern provinces. The\r\n_Acorus calamus_ extends over a large portion of the globe, but so\r\nrarely perfects fruit that this has been seen only by a few botanists;\r\naccording to Caspary, all its pollen-grains are in a worthless\r\ncondition.[112] The _Hypericum calycinum,_ which propagates itself so\r\nfreely in our shrubberies by rhizomes, and is naturalised in Ireland,\r\nblossoms profusely, but rarely sets any seed, and this only during\r\ncertain years; nor did it set any when fertilised in my garden by\r\npollen from plants growing at a distance. The _Lysimachia nummularia,_\r\nwhich is furnished with long runners, so seldom produces seed-capsules,\r\nthat Prof. Decaisne,[113] who has especially attended to this plant,\r\nhas never seen it in fruit. The _Carex rigida_ often fails to perfect\r\nits seed in Scotland, Lapland, Greenland, Germany, and New Hampshire in\r\nthe United States.[114] The periwinkle (_Vinca minor_), which spreads\r\nlargely by runners, is said scarcely ever to produce fruit in\r\nEngland;[115] but this plant requires insect-aid for its fertilisation,\r\nand the proper insects may be absent or rare. The Jussiaea grandiflora\r\nhas become naturalised in Southern France, and has spread by its\r\nrhizomes so extensively as to impede the navigation of the waters, but\r\nnever produces fertile seed.[116] The horse-radish (_Cochleria\r\narmoracia_) spreads pertinaciously and is naturalised in various parts\r\nof Europe; though it bears flowers, these rarely produce capsules:\r\nProfessor Caspary informs me that he has watched this plant since 1851,\r\nbut has never seen its fruit; 65 per cent of its pollen-grains are bad.\r\nThe common _ Ranunculus ficaria_ rarely bears seed in England, France,\r\nor Switzerland; but in 1863 I observed seeds on several plants growing\r\nnear my house.[117] Other cases analogous with the foregoing could be\r\ngiven; for instance, some kinds of mosses and lichens have never been\r\nseen to fructify in France.\r\n\r\nSome of these endemic and naturalised plants are probably rendered\r\nsterile from excessive multiplication by buds, and their consequent\r\nincapacity to produce and nourish seed. But the sterility of others\r\nmore probably depends on the peculiar conditions under which they live,\r\nas in the case of the ivy in the northern part of Europe, and of the\r\ntrees in the swamps of the United States; yet these plants must be in\r\nsome respects eminently well adapted for the stations which they\r\noccupy, for they hold their places against a host of competitors.\r\n\r\nFinally, the high degree of sterility which often accompanies the\r\ndoubling of flowers, or an excessive development of fruit, seldom\r\nsupervenes at once. An incipient tendency is observed, and continued\r\nselection completes the result. The view which seems the most probable,\r\nand which connects together all the foregoing facts and brings them\r\nwithin our present subject, is, that changed and unnatural conditions\r\nof life first give a tendency to sterility; and in consequence of this,\r\nthe organs of reproduction being no longer able fully to perform their\r\nproper functions, a supply of organised matter, not required for the\r\ndevelopment of the seed, flows either into these organs and renders\r\nthem foliaceous, or into the fruit, stems, tubers, etc., increasing\r\ntheir size and succulency. But it is probable that there exists,\r\nindependently of any incipient sterility, an antagonism between the two\r\nforms of reproduction, namely, by seed and buds, when either is carried\r\nto an extreme degree. That incipient sterility plays an important part\r\nin the doubling of flowers, and in the other cases just specified, I\r\ninfer chiefly from the following facts. When fertility is lost from a\r\nwholly different cause, namely, from hybridism, there is a strong\r\ntendency, as Gärtner[118] affirms, for flowers to become double, and\r\nthis tendency is inherited. Moreover, it is notorious that with hybrids\r\nthe male organs become sterile before the female organs, and with\r\ndouble flowers the stamens first become foliaceous. This latter fact is\r\nwell shown by the male flowers of dioecious plants, which, according to\r\nGallesio[119] first become double. Again, Gärtner[120] often insists\r\nthat the flowers of even utterly sterile hybrids, which do not produce\r\nany seed, generally yield perfect capsules or fruit,—a fact which has\r\nlikewise been repeatedly observed by Naudin with the Cucurbitaceæ; so\r\nthat the production of fruit by plants rendered sterile through any\r\ncause is intelligible. Kölreuter has also expressed his unbounded\r\nastonishment at the size and development of the tubers in certain\r\nhybrids; and all experimentalists[121] have remarked on the strong\r\ntendency in hybrids to increase by roots, runners, and suckers. Seeing\r\nthat hybrid plants, which from their nature are more or less sterile,\r\nthus tend to produce double flowers; that they have the parts including\r\nthe seed, that is the fruit, perfectly developed, even when containing\r\nno seed; that they sometimes yield gigantic roots; that they almost\r\ninvariably tend to increase largely by suckers and other such\r\nmeans;—seeing this, and knowing, from the many facts given in the\r\nearlier parts of this chapter, that almost all organic beings when\r\nexposed to unnatural conditions tend to become more or less sterile, it\r\nseems much the most probable view that with cultivated plants sterility\r\nis the exciting cause, and double flowers, rich seedless fruit, and in\r\nsome cases largely-developed organs of vegetation, etc., are the\r\nindirect results—these results having been in most cases largely\r\nincreased through continued selection by man.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] For England, _see_ below.

Denny of Leeds the lice which I collected from the wild\r\n aperea in La Plata, and he informs me that they belong to a genus\r\n distinct from those found on the guinea-pig. This is important\r\n evidence that the aperea is not the parent of the guinea-pig; and is\r\n worth giving, as some authors erroneously suppose that the guinea-pig\r\n since being domesticated has become sterile when crossed with the\r\n aperea.\r\n\r\n [21] Although the existence of the _Leporides,_ as described by Dr.\r\n Broca (‘Journal de Phys.,’ tom. ii. p. 370), has been positively\r\n denied, yet Dr. Pigeaux (‘Annals and Mag. of Nat.

SUMMARY OF THE FOUR LAST CHAPTERS, WITH REMARKS ON\r\nHYBRIDISM.\r\n\r\nON THE GOOD DERIVED ON THE EFFECTS OF CROSSING—THE INFLUENCE OF\r\nDOMESTICATION ON FERTILITY—CLOSE INTERBREEDING—GOOD AND EVIL RESULTS\r\nFROM CHANGED CONDITIONS OF LIFE—VARIETIES WHEN CROSSED NOT INVARIABLY\r\nFERTILE—ON THE DIFFERENCE IN FERTILITY BETWEEN CROSSED SPECIES AND\r\nVARIETIES—CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO HYBRIDISM—LIGHT THROWN ON\r\nHYBRIDISM BY THE ILLEGITIMATE PROGENY OF HETEROSTYLED PLANTS—STERILITY\r\nOF CROSSED SPECIES DUE TO DIFFERENCES CONFINED TO THE REPRODUCTIVE\r\nSYSTEM—NOT ACCUMULATED THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION—REASONS WHY DOMESTIC\r\nVARIETIES ARE NOT MUTUALLY STERILE—TOO MUCH STRESS HAS BEEN LAID ON THE\r\nDIFFERENCE IN FERTILITY BETWEEN CROSSED SPECIES AND CROSSED\r\nVARIETIES—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was shown in the fifteenth chapter that when individuals of the same\r\nvariety, or even of a distinct variety, are allowed freely to\r\nintercross, uniformity of character is ultimately acquired. Some few\r\ncharacters, however, are incapable of fusion, but these are\r\nunimportant, as they are often of a semi-monstrous nature, and have\r\nsuddenly appeared. Hence, to preserve our domesticated breeds true, or\r\nto improve them by methodical selection, it is obviously necessary that\r\nthey should be kept separate. Nevertheless, a whole body of individuals\r\nmay be slowly modified, through unconscious selection, as we shall see\r\nin a future chapter, without separating them into distinct lots.\r\nDomestic races have often been intentionally modified by one or two\r\ncrosses, made with some allied race, and occasionally even by repeated\r\ncrosses with very distinct races; but in almost all such cases,\r\nlong-continued and careful selection has been absolutely necessary,\r\nowing to the excessive variability of the crossed offspring, due to the\r\nprinciple of reversion. In a few instances, however, mongrels have\r\nretained a uniform character from their first production.\r\n\r\nWhen two varieties are allowed to cross freely, and one is much more\r\nnumerous than the other, the former will ultimately absorb the latter.\r\nShould both varieties exist in nearly equal numbers, it is probable\r\nthat a considerable period would elapse before the acquirement of a\r\nuniform character; and the character ultimately acquired would largely\r\ndepend on prepotency of transmission and on the conditions of life; for\r\nthe nature of these conditions would generally favour one variety more\r\nthan another, so that a kind of natural selection would come into play.\r\nUnless the crossed offspring were slaughtered by man without the least\r\ndiscrimination, some degree of unmethodical selection would likewise\r\ncome into action. From these several considerations we may infer, that\r\nwhen two or more closely allied species first came into the possession\r\nof the same tribe, their crossing will not have influenced, in so great\r\na degree as has often been supposed, the character of the offspring in\r\nfuture times; although in some cases it probably has had a considerable\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nDomestication, as a general rule, increases the prolificness of animals\r\nand plants. It eliminates the tendency to sterility which is common to\r\nspecies when first taken from a state of nature and crossed. On this\r\nlatter head we have no direct evidence; but as our races of dogs,\r\ncattle, pigs etc., are almost certainly descended from aboriginally\r\ndistinct stocks, and as these races are now fully fertile together, or\r\nat least incomparably more fertile than most species when crossed, we\r\nmay with entire confidence accept this conclusion.\r\n\r\nAbundant evidence has been given that crossing adds to the size,\r\nvigour, and fertility of the offspring. This holds good when there has\r\nbeen no previous close interbreeding. It applies to the individuals of\r\nthe same variety but belonging to different families, to distinct\r\nvarieties, sub-species, and even to species. In the latter case, though\r\nsize is gained, fertility is lost; but the increased size, vigour, and\r\nhardiness of many hybrids cannot be accounted for solely on the\r\nprinciple of compensation from the inaction of the reproductive system.\r\nCertain plants whilst growing under their natural conditions, others\r\nwhen cultivated, and others of hybrid origin, are completely\r\nself-impotent, though perfectly healthy; and such plants can be\r\nstimulated to fertility only by being crossed with other individuals of\r\nthe same or of a distinct species.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding between the\r\nnearest relations diminishes the constitutional vigour, size, and\r\nfertility of the offspring; and occasionally leads to malformations,\r\nbut not necessarily to general deterioration of form or structure. This\r\nfailure of fertility shows that the evil results of interbreeding are\r\nindependent of the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both\r\nparents, though this augmentation no doubt is often highly injurious.\r\nOur belief that evil follows from close interbreeding rests to a\r\ncertain extent on the experience of practical breeders, especially of\r\nthose who have reared many animals of quickly propagating kinds; but it\r\nlikewise rests on several carefully recorded experiments. With some\r\nanimals close interbreeding may be carried on for a long period with\r\nimpunity by the selection of the most vigorous and healthy individuals;\r\nbut sooner or later evil follows. The evil, however, comes on so slowly\r\nand gradually that it easily escapes observation, but can be recognised\r\nby the almost instantaneous manner in which size, constitutional\r\nvigour, and fertility are regained when animals that have long been\r\ninterbred are crossed with a distinct family.\r\n\r\nThese two great classes of facts, namely, the good derived from\r\ncrossing, and the evil from close interbreeding, with the consideration\r\nof the innumerable adaptations throughout nature for compelling, or\r\nfavouring, or at least permitting, the occasional union of distinct\r\nindividuals, taken together, lead to the conclusion that it is a law of\r\nnature that organic beings shall not fertilise themselves for\r\nperpetuity. This law was first plainly hinted at in 1799, with respect\r\nto plants, by Andrew Knight[1] and, not long afterwards, that sagacious\r\nobserver Kölreuter, after showing how well the Malvaceæ are adapted for\r\ncrossing, asks, “an id aliquid in recessu habeat, quod hujuscemodi\r\nflores nunquam proprio suo pulvere, sed semper eo aliarum su speciei\r\nimpregnentur, merito quæritur? Certe natura nil facit frustra.”\r\nAlthough we may demur to Kölreuter’s saying that nature does nothing in\r\nvain, seeing how many rudimentary and useless organs there are, yet\r\nundoubtedly the argument from the innumerable contrivances, which\r\nfavour crossing, is of the greatest weight. The most important result\r\nof this law is that it leads to uniformity of character in the\r\nindividuals of the same species. In the case of certain hermaphrodites,\r\nwhich probably intercross only at long intervals of time, and with\r\nunisexual animals inhabiting somewhat separated localities, which can\r\nonly occasionally come into contact and pair, the greater vigour and\r\nfertility of the crossed offspring will ultimately tend to give\r\nuniformity of character. But when we go beyond the limits of the same\r\nspecies, free intercrossing is barred by the law of sterility.\r\n\r\nIn searching for facts which might throw light on the cause of the good\r\neffects from crossing, and of the evil effects from close\r\ninterbreeding, we have seen that, on the one hand, it is a widely\r\nprevalent and ancient belief, that animals and plants profit from\r\nslight changes in their condition of life; and it would appear that the\r\ngerm, in a somewhat analogous manner, is more effectually stimulated by\r\nthe male element, when taken from a distinct individual, and therefore\r\nslightly modified in nature, than when taken from a male having the\r\nsame identical constitution. On the other hand, numerous facts have\r\nbeen given, showing that when animals are first subjected to captivity,\r\neven in their native land, and although allowed much liberty, their\r\nreproductive functions are often greatly impaired or quite annulled.\r\nSome groups of animals are more affected than others, but with\r\napparently capricious exceptions in every group. Some animals never or\r\nrarely couple under confinement; some couple freely, but never or\r\nrarely conceive. The secondary male characters, the maternal functions\r\nand instincts, are occasionally affected. With plants, when first\r\nsubjected to cultivation, analogous facts have been observed. We\r\nprobably owe our double flowers, rich seedless fruits, and in some\r\ncases greatly developed tubers, etc., to incipient sterility of the\r\nabove nature combined with a copious supply of nutriment. Animals which\r\nhave long been domesticated, and plants which have long been\r\ncultivated, can generally withstand, with unimpaired fertility, great\r\nchanges in their conditions of life; though both are sometimes slightly\r\naffected. With animals the somewhat rare capacity of breeding freely\r\nunder confinement, together with their utility, mainly determine the\r\nkinds which have been domesticated.\r\n\r\nWe can in no case precisely say what is the cause of the diminished\r\nfertility of an animal when first captured, or of a plant when first\r\ncultivated; we can only infer that it is caused by a change of some\r\nkind in the natural conditions of life. The remarkable susceptibility\r\nof the reproductive system to such changes,—a susceptibility not common\r\nto any other organ,—apparently has an important bearing on Variability,\r\nas we shall see in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to be struck with the double parallelism between\r\nthe two classes of facts just alluded to. On the one hand, slight\r\nchanges in the conditions of life, and crosses between slightly\r\nmodified forms or varieties, are beneficial as far as prolificness and\r\nconstitutional vigour are concerned. On the other hand, changes in the\r\nconditions greater in degree, or of a different nature, and crosses\r\nbetween forms which have been slowly and greatly modified by natural\r\nmeans,—in other words, between species,—are highly injurious, as far as\r\nthe reproductive system is concerned, and in some few instances as far\r\nas constitutional vigour is concerned. Can this parallelism be\r\naccidental? Does it not rather indicate some real bond of connection?\r\nAs a fire goes out unless it be stirred up, so the vital forces are\r\nalways tending, according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, to a state of\r\nequilibrium, unless disturbed and renovated through the action of other\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nIn some few cases varieties tend to keep distinct, by breeding at\r\ndifferent seasons, by great difference in size, or by sexual\r\npreference. But the crossing of varieties, far from diminishing,\r\ngenerally adds to the fertility of the first union and of the mongrel\r\noffspring. Whether all the more widely distinct domestic varieties are\r\ninvariably quite fertile when crossed, we do not positively know; much\r\ntime and trouble would be requisite for the necessary experiments, and\r\nmany difficulties occur, such as the descent of the various races from\r\naboriginally distinct species, and the doubts whether certain forms\r\nought to be ranked as species or varieties. Nevertheless, the wide\r\nexperience of practical breeders proves that the great majority of\r\nvarieties, even if some should hereafter prove not to be indefinitely\r\nfertile _inter se,_ are far more fertile when crossed, than the vast\r\nmajority of closely allied natural species. A few remarkable cases\r\nhave, however, been given on the authority of excellent observers,\r\nshowing that with plants certain forms, which undoubtedly must be\r\nranked as varieties, yield fewer seeds when crossed than is natural to\r\nthe parent-species. Other varieties have had their reproductive powers\r\nso far modified that they are either more or less fertile than their\r\nparents, when crossed with a distinct species.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the fact remains indisputable that domesticated\r\nvarieties, of animals and of plants, which differ greatly from one\r\nanother in structure, but which are certainly descended from the same\r\naboriginal species, such as the races of the fowl, pigeon, many\r\nvegetables, and a host of other productions, are extremely fertile when\r\ncrossed; and this seems to make a broad and impassable barrier between\r\ndomestic varieties and natural species. But, as I will now attempt to\r\nshow, the distinction is not so great and overwhelmingly important as\r\nit at first appears.\r\n\r\n      _On the Difference in Fertility between Varieties and Species\r\n      when crossed._\r\n\r\nThis work is not the proper place for fully treating the subject of\r\nhybridism, and I have already given in my ‘Origin of Species’ a\r\nmoderately full abstract. I will here merely enumerate the general\r\nconclusions which may be relied on, and which bear on our present\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n_Firstly,_ the laws governing the production of hybrids are identical,\r\nor nearly identical, in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\n_Secondly,_ the sterility of distinct species when first united, and\r\nthat of their hybrid offspring, graduate, by an almost infinite number\r\nof steps, from zero, when the ovule is never impregnated and a\r\nseed-capsule is never formed, up to complete fertility. We can only\r\nescape the conclusion that some species are fully fertile when crossed,\r\nby determining to designate as varieties all the forms which are quite\r\nfertile. This high degree of fertility is, however, rare. Nevertheless,\r\nplants, which have been exposed to unnatural conditions, sometimes\r\nbecome modified in so peculiar a manner, that they are much more\r\nfertile when crossed with a distinct species than when fertilised by\r\ntheir own pollen. Success in effecting a first union between two\r\nspecies, and the fertility of their hybrids, depend in an eminent\r\ndegree on the conditions of life being favourable. The innate sterility\r\nof hybrids of the same parentage and raised from the same seed-capsule\r\noften differs much in degree.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly,_ the degree of sterility of a first cross between two species\r\ndoes not always run strictly parallel with that of their hybrid\r\noffspring. Many cases are known of species which can be crossed with\r\nease, but yield hybrids excessively sterile; and conversely some which\r\ncan be crossed with great difficulty, but produce fairly fertile\r\nhybrids. This is an inexplicable fact, on the view that species have\r\nbeen specially endowed with mutual sterility in order to keep them\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly,_ the degree of sterility often differs greatly in two\r\nspecies when reciprocally crossed; for the first will readily fertilise\r\nthe second; but the latter is incapable, after hundreds of trials, of\r\nfertilising the former. Hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses\r\nbetween the same two species likewise sometimes differ in their degree\r\nof sterility. These cases also are utterly inexplicable on the view of\r\nsterility being a special endowment.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly,_ the degree of sterility of first crosses and of hybrids\r\nruns, to a certain extent, parallel with the general or systematic\r\naffinity of the forms which are united. For species belonging to\r\ndistinct genera can rarely, and those belonging to distinct families\r\ncan never, be crossed. The parallelism, however, is far from complete;\r\nfor a multitude of closely allied species will not unite, or unite with\r\nextreme difficulty, whilst other species, widely different from one\r\nanother, can be crossed with perfect facility. Nor does the difficulty\r\ndepend on ordinary constitutional differences, for annual and perennial\r\nplants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants flowering at different\r\nseasons, inhabiting different stations, and naturally living under the\r\nmost opposite climates, can often be crossed with ease. The difficulty\r\nor facility apparently depends exclusively on the sexual constitution\r\nof the species which are crossed; or on their sexual elective affinity,\r\n_i.e. Wahlverwandtschaft_ of Gärtner. As species rarely or never become\r\nmodified in one character, without being at the same time modified in\r\nmany characters, and as systematic affinity includes all visible\r\nsimilarities and dissimilarities, any difference in sexual constitution\r\nbetween two species would naturally stand in more or less close\r\nrelation with their systematic position.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly,_ the sterility of species when first crossed, and that of\r\nhybrids, may possibly depend to a certain extent on distinct causes.\r\nWith pure species the reproductive organs are in a perfect condition,\r\nwhilst with hybrids they are often plainly deteriorated. A hybrid\r\nembryo which partakes of the constitution of its father and mother is\r\nexposed to unnatural conditions, as long as it is nourished within the\r\nwomb, or egg, or seed of the mother-form; and as we know that unnatural\r\nconditions often induce sterility, the reproductive organs of the\r\nhybrid might at this early age be permanently affected. But this cause\r\nhas no bearing on the infertility of first unions. The diminished\r\nnumber of the offspring from first unions may often result, as is\r\ncertainly sometimes the case, from the premature death of most of the\r\nhybrid embryos. But we shall immediately see that a law of an unknown\r\nnature apparently exists, which leads to the offspring from unions,\r\nwhich are infertile, being themselves more or less infertile; and this\r\nat present is all that can be said.\r\n\r\n_Seventhly,_ hybrids and mongrels present, with the one great exception\r\nof fertility, the most striking accordance in all other respects;\r\nnamely, in the laws of their resemblance to their two parents, in their\r\ntendency to reversion, in their variability, and in being absorbed\r\nthrough repeated crosses by either parent-form.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving at these conclusions, I was led to investigate a subject\r\nwhich throws considerable light on hybridism, namely, the fertility of\r\nheterostyled or dimorphic and trimorphic plants, when illegitimately\r\nunited. I have had occasion several times to allude to these plants,\r\nand I may here give a brief abstract of my observations. Several plants\r\nbelonging to distinct orders present two forms, which exist in about\r\nequal numbers, and which differ in no respect except in their\r\nreproductive organs; one form having a long pistil with short stamens,\r\nthe other a short pistil with long stamens; both with differently sized\r\npollen-grains. With trimorphic plants there are three forms likewise\r\ndiffering in the lengths of their pistils and stamens, in the size and\r\ncolour of the pollen-grains, and in some other respects; and as in each\r\nof the three forms there are two sets of stamens, there are altogether\r\nsix sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils. These organs are so\r\nproportioned in length to one another that, in any two of the forms,\r\nhalf the stamens in each stand on a level with the stigma of the third\r\nform. Now I have shown, and the result has been confirmed by other\r\nobservers, that, in order to obtain full fertility with these plants,\r\nit is necessary that the stigma of the one form should be fertilised by\r\npollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in the other\r\nform. So that with dimorphic species two unions, which may be called\r\nlegitimate, are fully fertile, and two, which may be called\r\nillegitimate, are more or less infertile. With trimorphic species six\r\nunions are legitimate, or fully fertile, and twelve are illegitimate,\r\nor more or less infertile.[2]\r\n\r\nThe infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants, when illegitimately fertilised, that is, by pollen\r\ntaken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil, differs\r\nmuch in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in the same\r\nmanner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the degree of\r\nsterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the\r\nconditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it\r\nwith illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen of a distinct\r\nspecies be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be\r\nafterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the\r\nsame stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally\r\nannihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen\r\nof the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is\r\nstrongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on\r\nthe same stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers,\r\nfirst illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately,\r\nwith pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the\r\nseedlings were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate\r\npollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly\r\ndestroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied\r\nillegitimate pollen. Again, as, in making reciprocal crosses between\r\nthe same two species, there is occasionally a great difference in the\r\nresult, so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance,\r\nthe mid-styled form of _Lythrum salicaria_ could be illegitimately\r\nfertilised with the greatest ease by pollen from the longer stamens of\r\nthe short-styled form, and yielded many seeds; but the short-styled\r\nform did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens\r\nof the mid-styled form.\r\n\r\nIn all these respects the forms of the same undoubted species, when\r\nillegitimately united, behave in exactly the same manner as do two\r\ndistinct species when crossed. This led me carefully to observe during\r\nfour years many seedlings, raised from several illegitimate unions. The\r\nchief result is that these illegitimate plants, as they may be called,\r\nare not fully fertile. It is possible to raise from dimorphic species,\r\nboth long-styled and short-styled illegitimate plants, and from\r\ntrimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms. These can then be\r\nproperly united in a legitimate manner. When this is done, there is no\r\napparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as did their\r\nparents when legitimately fertilised. But such is not the case; they\r\nare all infertile, but in various degrees; some being so utterly and\r\nincurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a single\r\nseed or even seed-capsule. These illegitimate plants, which are so\r\nsterile, although united with each other in a legitimate manner, may be\r\nstrictly compared with hybrids when crossed _inter se,_ and it is well\r\nknown how sterile these latter generally are. When, on the other hand,\r\na hybrid is crossed with either pure parent-species, the sterility is\r\nusually much lessened: and so it is when an illegitimate plant is\r\nfertilised by a legitimate plant. In the same manner as the sterility\r\nof hybrids does not always run parallel with the difficulty of making\r\nthe first cross between the two parent-species, so the sterility of\r\ncertain illegitimate plants was unusually great, whilst the sterility\r\nof the union from which they were derived was by no means great. With\r\nhybrids raised from the same seed-capsule the degree of sterility is\r\ninnately variable, so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate\r\nplants. Lastly, many hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers,\r\nwhilst other and more sterile hybrids produce few flowers, and are\r\nweak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur with the\r\nillegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic plants.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is the closest identity in character and behaviour\r\nbetween illegitimate plants and hybrids, it is hardly an exaggeration\r\nto maintain that the former are hybrids, but produced within the limits\r\nof the same species by the improper union of certain forms, whilst\r\nordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between so-called\r\ndistinct species. We have already seen that there is the closest\r\nsimilarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions, and first\r\ncrosses between distinct species. This will perhaps be made more fully\r\napparent by an illustration:—we may suppose that a botanist found two\r\nwell-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of the\r\ntrimorphic _Lithrum salicaria,_ and that he determined to try by\r\ncrossing whether they were specifically distinct. He would find that\r\nthey yielded only about one-fifth of the proper number of seed, and\r\nthat they behaved in all the other above-specified respects as if they\r\nhad been two distinct species. But to make the case sure, he would\r\nraise plants from his supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that\r\nthe seedlings were miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they\r\nbehaved in all other respects like ordinary hybrids, he might then\r\nmaintain that he had actually proved, in accordance with the common\r\nview, that his two varieties were as good and as distinct species as\r\nany in the world; but he would be completely mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important,\r\nbecause they show us, first, that the physiological test of lessened\r\nfertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no criterion of\r\nspecific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude that there is\r\nsome unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions\r\nwith that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are led to extend the\r\nsame view to first crosses and hybrids; thirdly, because we find, and\r\nthis seems to me of especial importance, that two or three forms of the\r\nsame species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in\r\nstructure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions, and\r\nyet be sterile when united in certain ways. For we must remember that\r\nit is the union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form,\r\nfor instance, of two long-styled forms, which results in sterility;\r\nwhilst it is the union of the sexual element proper to two distinct\r\nforms which is fertile. Hence the case appears at first sight exactly\r\nthe reverse of what occurs in the ordinary unions of the individuals of\r\nthe same species, and with crosses between distinct species. It is,\r\nhowever, doubtful whether this is really so; but I will not enlarge on\r\nthis obscure subject.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic\r\nand trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct species when\r\ncrossed, and of their hybrid progeny, depends exclusively on the nature\r\nof their sexual elements, and not on any difference in their structure\r\nor general constitution. We are also led to this same conclusion by\r\nconsidering reciprocal crosses, in which the male of one species cannot\r\nbe united, or only with great difficulty, with the female of a second\r\nspecies, whilst the converse cross can be effected with perfect\r\nfacility. That excellent observer, Gärtner, likewise concluded that\r\nspecies when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their\r\nreproductive systems.\r\n\r\nOn the principle which makes it necessary for man, whilst he is\r\nselecting and improving his domestic varieties, to keep them separate,\r\nit would clearly be advantageous to varieties in a state of nature,\r\nthat is to incipient species, if they could be kept from blending,\r\neither through sexual aversion, or by becoming mutually sterile. Hence\r\nit at one time appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that this\r\nsterility might have been acquired through natural selection. On this\r\nview we must suppose that a shade of lessened fertility first\r\nspontaneously appeared, like any other modification, in certain\r\nindividuals of a species when crossed with other individuals of the\r\nsame species; and that successive slight degrees of infertility, from\r\nbeing advantageous, were slowly accumulated. This appears all the more\r\nprobable, if we admit that the structural differences between the forms\r\nof dimorphic and trimorphic plants, as the length and curvature of the\r\npistil, etc., have been co-adapted through natural selection; for if\r\nthis be admitted, we can hardly avoid extending the same conclusion to\r\ntheir mutual infertility. Sterility, moreover, has been acquired\r\nthrough natural selection for other and widely different purposes, as\r\nwith neuter insects in reference to their social economy. In the case\r\nof plants, the flowers on the circumference of the truss in the guelder\r\nrose (_Viburnum opulus_) and those on the summit of the spike in the\r\nfeather-hyacinth (_Muscari comosum_) have been rendered conspicuous,\r\nand apparently in consequence sterile, in order that insects might\r\neasily discover and visit the perfect flowers. But when we endeavour to\r\napply the principle of natural selection to the acquirement by distinct\r\nspecies of mutual sterility, we meet with great difficulties. In the\r\nfirst place, it may be remarked that separate regions are often\r\ninhabited by groups of species or by single species, which when brought\r\ntogether and crossed are found to be more or less sterile; now it could\r\nclearly have been no advantage to such separated species to have been\r\nrendered mutually sterile, and consequently this could not have been\r\neffected through natural selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that,\r\nif a species were rendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility\r\nwith other species would follow as a necessary consequence. In the\r\nsecond place, it is as much opposed to the theory of natural selection,\r\nas to the theory of special creation, that in reciprocal crosses the\r\nmale element of one form should have been rendered utterly impotent on\r\na second form, whilst at the same time the male element of this second\r\nform is enabled freely to fertilise the first form; for this peculiar\r\nstate of the reproductive system could not possibly have been\r\nadvantageous to either species.\r\n\r\nIn considering the probability of natural selection having come into\r\naction in rendering species mutually sterile, one of the greatest\r\ndifficulties will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated\r\nsteps from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be\r\nadmitted, on the principle above explained, that it would profit an\r\nincipient species if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile\r\nwhen crossed with its parent-form or with some other variety; for thus\r\nfewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to\r\ncommingle their blood with the new species in process of formation. But\r\nhe who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this\r\nfirst degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection\r\nto that higher degree which is common to so many species, and which is\r\nuniversal with species which have been differentiated to a generic or\r\nfamily rank, will find the subject extraordinarily complex. After\r\nmature reflection it seems to me that this could not have been effected\r\nthrough natural selection. Take the case of any two species which, when\r\ncrossed, produce few and sterile offspring; now, what is there which\r\ncould favour the survival of those individuals which happened to be\r\nendowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility, and which\r\nthus approached by one small step towards absolute sterility? Yet an\r\nadvance of this kind, if the theory of natural selection be brought to\r\nbear, must have incessantly occurred with many species, for a multitude\r\nare mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects we have reason\r\nto believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have\r\nbeen slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an advantage having\r\nbeen thus indirectly given to the community to which they belonged over\r\nother communities of the same species; but an individual animal not\r\nbelonging to a social community, if rendered slightly sterile when\r\ncrossed with some other variety, would not thus itself gain any\r\nadvantage or indirectly give any advantage to the other individuals of\r\nthe same variety, thus leading to their preservation.\r\n\r\nBut it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail; for\r\nwith plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed\r\nspecies must be due to some principle, quite independent of natural\r\nselection. Both Gärtner and Kolreuter have proved that in general\r\nincluding numerous species, a series can be formed from species which\r\nwhen crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never\r\nproduce a single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of certain\r\nother species, for the germen swells. It is here manifestly impossible\r\nto select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to\r\nyield seeds; so that this acme of sterility, when the germen alone is\r\naffected, cannot have been gained through selection; and from the laws\r\ngoverning the various grades of sterility being so uniform throughout\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the cause,\r\nwhatever it may be, is the same or nearly the same in all cases.\r\n\r\nAs species have not been rendered mutually infertile through the\r\naccumulative action of natural selection, and as we may safely\r\nconclude, from the previous as well as from other and more general\r\nconsiderations, that they have not been endowed through an act of\r\ncreation with this quality, we must infer that it has arisen\r\nincidentally during their slow formation in connection with other and\r\nunknown changes in their organisation. By a quality arising\r\nincidentally, I refer to such cases as different species of animals and\r\nplants being differently affected by poisons to which they are not\r\nnaturally exposed; and this difference in susceptibility is clearly\r\nincidental on other and unknown differences in their organisation. So\r\nagain the capacity in different kinds of trees to be grafted on each\r\nother, or on a third species, differs much, and is of no advantage to\r\nthese trees, but is incidental on structural or functional differences\r\nin their woody tissues. We need not feel surprise at sterility\r\nincidentally resulting from crosses between distinct species,—the\r\nmodified descendants of a common progenitor,—when we bear in mind how\r\neasily the reproductive system is affected by various causes—often by\r\nextremely slight changes in the conditions of life, by too close\r\ninterbreeding, and by other agencies. It is well to bear in mind such\r\ncases as that of the _Passiflora alata,_ which recovered its\r\nself-fertility from being grafted on a distinct species—the cases of\r\nplants which normally or abnormally are self-impotent, but can readily\r\nbe fertilised by the pollen of a distinct species—and lastly the cases\r\nof individual domesticated animals which evince towards each other\r\nsexual incompatibility.\r\n\r\nWe now at last come to the immediate point under discussion: how is it\r\nthat, with some few exceptions in the case of plants, domesticated\r\nvarieties, such as those of the dog, fowl, pigeon, several fruit-trees,\r\nand culinary vegetables, which differ from each other in external\r\ncharacters more than many species, are perfectly fertile when crossed,\r\nor even fertile in excess, whilst closely allied species are almost\r\ninvariably in some degree sterile? We can, to a certain extent, give a\r\nsatisfactory answer to this question. Passing over the fact that the\r\namount of external difference between two species is no sure guide to\r\ntheir degree of mutual sterility, so that similar differences in the\r\ncase of varieties would be no sure guide, we know that with species the\r\ncause lies exclusively in differences in their sexual constitution. Now\r\nthe conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have\r\nbeen subjected have had so little tendency towards modifying the\r\nreproductive system in a manner leading to mutual sterility, that we\r\nhave very good grounds for admitting the directly opposite doctrine of\r\nPallas, namely, that such conditions generally eliminate this tendency;\r\nso that the domesticated descendants of species, which in their natural\r\nstate would have been in some degree sterile when crossed, become\r\nperfectly fertile together. With plants, so far is cultivation from\r\ngiving a tendency towards mutual sterility, that in several\r\nwell-authenticated cases, already often alluded to, certain species\r\nhave been affected in a very different manner, for they have become\r\nself-impotent, whilst still retaining the capacity of fertilising, and\r\nbeing fertilised by, distinct species. If the Pallasian doctrine of the\r\nelimination of sterility through long-continued domestication be\r\nadmitted, and it can hardly be rejected, it becomes in the highest\r\ndegree improbable that similar circumstances should commonly both\r\ninduce and eliminate the same tendency; though in certain cases, with\r\nspecies having a peculiar constitution, sterility might occasionally be\r\nthus induced. Thus, as I believe, we can understand why with\r\ndomesticated animals varieties have not been produced which are\r\nmutually sterile; and why with plants only a few such cases have been\r\nobserved, namely, by Gärtner, with certain varieties of maize and\r\nverbascum, by other experimentalists with varieties of the gourd and\r\nmelon, and by Kölreuter with one kind of tobacco.\r\n\r\nWith respect to varieties which have originated in a state of nature,\r\nit is almost hopeless to expect to prove by direct evidence that they\r\nhave been rendered mutually sterile; for if even a trace of sterility\r\ncould be detected, such varieties would at once be raised by almost\r\nevery naturalist to the rank of distinct species. If, for instance,\r\nGärtner’s statement were fully confirmed, that the blue and red\r\nflowered forms of the pimpernel (_Anagallis arvensis_) are sterile when\r\ncrossed, I presume that all the botanists who now maintain on various\r\ngrounds that these two forms are merely fleeting varieties, would at\r\nonce admit that they were specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to me,\r\nwhy domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed,\r\nbut why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties as soon\r\nas they have been modified in a sufficient and permanent degree to take\r\nrank as species. We are far from precisely knowing the cause; but we\r\ncan see that the species, owing to their struggle for existence with\r\nnumerous competitors, must have been exposed to more uniform conditions\r\nof life during long periods of time than domestic varieties have been,\r\nand this may well make a wide difference in the result. For we know how\r\ncommonly wild animals and plants, when taken from their natural\r\nconditions and subjected to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the\r\nreproductive functions of organic beings which have always lived and\r\nbeen slowly modified under natural conditions would probably in like\r\nmanner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural cross.\r\nDomesticated productions, on the other hand, which, as shown by the\r\nmere fact of their domestication, were not originally highly sensitive\r\nto changes in their conditions of life, and which can now generally\r\nresist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of conditions,\r\nmight be expected to produce varieties, which would be little liable to\r\nhave their reproductive powers injuriously affected by the act of\r\ncrossing with other varieties which had originated in a like manner.\r\n\r\nCertain naturalists have recently laid too great stress, as it appears\r\nto me, on the difference in fertility between varieties and species\r\nwhen crossed. Some allied species of trees cannot be grafted on one\r\nanother, whilst all varieties can be so grafted. Some allied animals\r\nare affected in a very different manner by the same poison, but with\r\nvarieties no such case until recently was known; whilst now it has been\r\nproved that immunity from certain poisons sometimes stands in\r\ncorrelation with the colour of the individuals of the same species. The\r\nperiod of gestation generally differs much in distinct species, but\r\nwith varieties until lately no such difference had been observed. Here\r\nwe have various physiological differences, and no doubt others could be\r\nadded, between one species and another of the same genus, which do not\r\noccur, or occur with extreme rarity, in the case of varieties; and\r\nthese differences are apparently wholly or in chief part incidental on\r\nother constitutional differences, just in the same manner as the\r\nsterility of crossed species is incidental on differences confined to\r\nthe sexual system. Why, then, should these latter differences, however\r\nserviceable they may indirectly be in keeping the inhabitants of the\r\nsame country distinct, be thought of such paramount importance, in\r\ncomparison with other incidental and functional differences? No\r\nsufficient answer to this question can be given. Hence the fact that\r\nwidely distinct domestic varieties are, with rare exceptions, perfectly\r\nfertile when crossed, and produce fertile offspring, whilst closely\r\nallied species are, with rare exceptions, more or less sterile, is not\r\nnearly so formidable an objection as it appears at first to the theory\r\nof the common descent of allied species.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Transactions Phil.

SELECTION BY MAN.\r\n\r\nSELECTION A DIFFICULT ART—METHODICAL, UNCONSCIOUS, AND NATURAL\r\nSELECTION—RESULTS OF METHODICAL SELECTION—CARE TAKEN IN\r\nSELECTION—SELECTION WITH PLANTS—SELECTION CARRIED ON BY THE ANCIENTS\r\nAND BY SEMI-CIVILISED PEOPLE—UNIMPORTANT CHARACTERS OFTEN ATTENDED\r\nTO—UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION—AS CIRCUMSTANCES SLOWLY CHANGE, SO HAVE OUR\r\nDOMESTICATED ANIMALS CHANGED THROUGH THE ACTION OF UNCONSCIOUS\r\nSELECTION—INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT BREEDERS ON THE SAME\r\nSUB-VARIETY—PLANTS AS AFFECTED BY UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION—EFFECTS OF\r\nSELECTION AS SHOWN BY THE GREAT AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE PARTS MOST\r\nVALUED BY MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power of Selection, whether exercised by man, or brought into play\r\nunder nature through the struggle for existence and the consequent\r\nsurvival of the fittest, absolutely depends on the variability of\r\norganic beings. Without variability nothing can be effected; slight\r\nindividual differences, however, suffice for the work, and are probably\r\nthe chief or sole means in the production of new species. Hence our\r\ndiscussion on the causes and laws of variability ought in strict order\r\nto have preceded the present subject, as well as inheritance, crossing,\r\netc.; but practically the present arrangement has been found the most\r\nconvenient. Man does not attempt to cause variability; though he\r\nunintentionally effects this by exposing organisms to new conditions of\r\nlife, and by crossing breeds already formed. But variability being\r\ngranted, he works wonders. Unless some degree of selection be\r\nexercised, the free commingling of the individuals of the same variety\r\nsoon obliterates, as we have previously seen, the slight differences\r\nwhich arise, and gives uniformity of character to the whole body of\r\nindividuals. In separated districts, long-continued exposure to\r\ndifferent conditions of life may produce new races without the aid of\r\nselection; but to this subject of the direct action of the conditions\r\nof life I shall recur in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen animals or plants are born with some conspicuous and firmly\r\ninherited new character, selection is reduced to the preservation of\r\nsuch individuals, and to the subsequent prevention of crosses; so that\r\nnothing more need be said on the subject. But in the great majority of\r\ncases a new character, or some superiority in an old character, is at\r\nfirst faintly pronounced, and is not strongly inherited; and then the\r\nfull difficulty of selection is experienced. Indomitable patience, the\r\nfinest powers of discrimination, and sound judgment must be exercised\r\nduring many years. A clearly predetermined object must be kept steadily\r\nin view. Few men are endowed with all these qualities, especially with\r\nthat of discriminating very slight differences; judgment can be\r\nacquired only by long experience; but if any of these qualities be\r\nwanting, the labour of a life may be thrown away. I have been\r\nastonished when celebrated breeders, whose skill and judgment have been\r\nproved by their success at exhibitions, have shown me their animals,\r\nwhich appeared all alike, and have assigned their reasons for matching\r\nthis and that individual. The importance of the great principle of\r\nSelection mainly lies in this power of selecting scarcely appreciable\r\ndifferences, which nevertheless are found to be transmissible, and\r\nwhich can be accumulated until the result is made manifest to the eyes\r\nof every beholder.\r\n\r\nThe principle of selection may be conveniently divided into three\r\nkinds. _Methodical selection_ is that which guides a man who\r\nsystematically endeavours to modify a breed according to some\r\npredetermined standard. _Unconscious selection_ is that which follows\r\nfrom men naturally preserving the most valued and destroying the less\r\nvalued individuals, without any thought of altering the breed; and\r\nundoubtedly this process slowly works great changes. Unconscious\r\nselection graduates into methodical, and only extreme cases can be\r\ndistinctly separated; for he who preserves a useful or perfect animal\r\nwill generally breed from it with the hope of getting offspring of the\r\nsame character; but as long as he has not a predetermined purpose to\r\nimprove the breed, he may be said to be selecting unconsciously.[1]\r\nLastly, we have _Natural selection,_ which implies that the individuals\r\nwhich are best fitted for the complex, and in the course of ages\r\nchanging conditions to which they are exposed, generally survive and\r\nprocreate their kind. With domestic productions, natural selection\r\ncomes to a certain extent into action, independently of, and even in\r\nopposition to, the will of man.\r\n\r\n_Methodical Selection._—What man has effected within recent times in\r\nEngland by methodical selection is clearly shown by our exhibitions of\r\nimproved quadrupeds and fancy birds. With respect to cattle, sheep, and\r\npigs, we owe their great improvement to a long series of well-known\r\nnames—Bakewell, Coiling, Ellman, Bates, Jonas Webb, Lords Leicester and\r\nWestern, Fisher Hobbs, and others. Agricultural writers are unanimous\r\non the power of selection: any number of statements to this effect\r\ncould be quoted; a few will suffice. Youatt, a sagacious and\r\nexperienced observer, writes[2] the principle of selection is “that\r\nwhich enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of\r\nhis flock, but to change it altogether.” A great breeder of\r\nShorthorns[3] says, “In the anatomy of the shoulder modern breeders\r\nhave made great improvement on the Ketton shorthorns by correcting the\r\ndefect in the knuckle or shoulder-joint, and by laying the top of the\r\nshoulder more snugly in the crop, and thereby filling up the hollow\r\nbehind it . . . The eye has its fashion at different periods: at one\r\ntime the eye high and outstanding from the head, and at another time\r\nthe sleepy eye sunk into the head; but these extremes have merged into\r\nthe medium of a full, clear and prominent eye with a placid look.”\r\n\r\nAgain, hear what an excellent judge of pigs[4] says: “The legs should\r\nbe no longer than just to prevent the animal’s belly from trailing on\r\nthe ground. The leg is the least profitable portion of the hog, and we\r\ntherefore require no more of it than is absolutely necessary for the\r\nsupport of the rest.” Let any one compare the wild-boar with any\r\nimproved breed, and he will see how effectually the legs have been\r\nshortened.\r\n\r\nFew persons, except breeders, are aware of the systematic care taken in\r\nselecting animals, and of the necessity of having a clear and almost\r\nprophetic vision into futurity. Lord Spencer’s skill and judgment were\r\nwell known; and he writes,[5] “It is therefore very desirable, before\r\nany man commences to breed either cattle or sheep, that he should make\r\nup his mind to the shape and qualities he wishes to obtain, and\r\nsteadily pursue this object.” Lord Somerville, in speaking of the\r\nmarvellous improvement of the New Leicester sheep, effected by Bakewell\r\nand his successors, says, “It would seem as if they had first drawn a\r\nperfect form, and then given it life.” Youatt[6] urges the necessity of\r\nannually drafting each flock, as many animals will certainly degenerate\r\n“from the standard of excellence which the breeder has established in\r\nhis own mind.” Even with a bird of such little importance as the\r\ncanary, long ago (1780-1790) rules were established, and a standard of\r\nperfection was fixed according to which the London fanciers tried to\r\nbreed the several sub-varieties.[7] A great winner of prizes at the\r\nPigeon-shows,[8] in describing the short-faced Almond Tumbler, says,\r\n“There are many first-rate fanciers who are particularly partial to\r\nwhat is called the goldfinch-beak, which is very beautiful; others say,\r\ntake a full-size round cherry then take a barleycorn, and judiciously\r\nplacing and thrusting it into the cherry, form as it were your beak;\r\nand that is not all, for it will form a good head and beak, provided,\r\nas I said before, it is judiciously done; others take an oat; but as I\r\nthink the goldfinch-beak the handsomest, I would advise the\r\ninexperienced fancier to get the head of a goldfinch, and keep it by\r\nhim for his observation.” Wonderfully different as are the beaks of the\r\nrock pigeon and goldfinch, the end has undoubtedly been nearly gained,\r\nas far as external shape and proportions are concerned.\r\n\r\nNot only should our animals be examined with the greatest care whilst\r\nalive, but, as Anderson remarks[9] their carcases should be\r\nscrutinised, “so as to breed from the descendants of such only as, in\r\nthe language of the butcher, cut up well.” The “grain of the meat” in\r\ncattle, and its being well marbled with fat,[10] and the greater or\r\nless accumulation of fat in the abdomen of our sheep, have been\r\nattended to with success. So with poultry, a writer,[11] speaking of\r\nCochin-China fowls, which are said to differ much in the quality of\r\ntheir flesh, says, “the best mode is to purchase two young\r\nbrother-cocks, kill, dress, and serve up one; if he be indifferent,\r\nsimilarly dispose of the other, and try again; if, however, he be fine\r\nand well-flavoured, his brother will not be amiss for breeding purposes\r\nfor the table.”\r\n\r\nThe great principle of the division of labour has been brought to bear\r\non selection. In certain districts[12] “the breeding of bulls is\r\nconfined to a very limited number of persons, who by devoting their\r\nwhole attention to this department, are able from year to year to\r\nfurnish a class of bulls which are steadily improving the general breed\r\nof the district.” The rearing and letting of choice rams has long been,\r\nas is well known, a chief source of profit to several eminent breeders.\r\nIn parts of Germany this principle is carried with merino sheep to an\r\nextreme point.[13] So “important is the proper selection of breeding\r\nanimals considered, that the best flock-masters do not trust to their\r\nown judgment or to that of their shepherds, but employ persons called\r\n‘sheep-classifiers’ who make it their special business to attend to\r\nthis part of the management of several flocks, and thus to preserve, or\r\nif possible to improve, the best qualities of both parents in the\r\nlambs.” In Saxony, “when the lambs are weaned, each in his turn is\r\nplaced upon a table that his wool and form may be minutely observed.\r\nThe finest are selected for breeding and receive a first mark. When\r\nthey are one year old, and prior to shearing them, another close\r\nexamination of those previously marked takes place: those in which no\r\ndefect can be found receive a second mark, and the rest are condemned.\r\nA few months afterwards a third and last scrutiny is made; the prime\r\nrams and ewes receive a third and final mark, but the slightest blemish\r\nis sufficient to cause the rejection of the animal.” These sheep are\r\nbred and valued almost exclusively for the fineness of their wool; and\r\nthe result corresponds with the labour bestowed on their selection.\r\nInstruments have been invented to measure accurately the thickness of\r\nthe fibres; and “an Austrian fleece has been produced of which twelve\r\nhairs equalled in thickness one from a Leicester sheep.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, wherever silk is produced, the greatest care is\r\nbestowed on selecting the cocoons from which the moths for breeding are\r\nto be reared. A careful cultivator[14] likewise examines the moths\r\nthemselves, and destroys those that are not perfect. But what more\r\nimmediately concerns us is that certain families in France devote\r\nthemselves to raising eggs for sale.[15] In China, near Shanghai, the\r\ninhabitants of two small districts have the privilege of raising eggs\r\nfor the whole surrounding country, and that they may give up their\r\nwhole time to this business, they are interdicted by law from producing\r\nsilk.[16]\r\n\r\nThe care which successful breeders take in matching their birds is\r\nsurprising. Sir John Sebright, whose fame is perpetuated by the\r\n“Sebright Bantam,” used to spend “two and three days in examining,\r\nconsulting, and disputing with a friend which were the best of five or\r\nsix birds.”[17] Mr. Bult, whose pouter-pigeons won so many prizes, and\r\nwere exported to North America under the charge of a man sent on\r\npurpose, told me that he always deliberated for several days before he\r\nmatched each pair. Hence we can understand the advice of an eminent\r\nfancier, who writes[18] “I would here particularly guard you against\r\nhaving too great a variety of pigeons, otherwise you will know a little\r\nof all, but nothing about one as it ought to be known.” Apparently it\r\ntranscends the power of the human intellect to breed all kinds: “it is\r\npossible that there may be a few fanciers that have a good general\r\nknowledge of fancy pigeons; but there are many more who labour under\r\nthe delusion of supposing they know what they do not.” The excellence\r\nof one sub-variety, the Almond Tumbler, lies in the plumage, carriage,\r\nhead, beak, and eye; but it is too presumptuous in the beginner to try\r\nfor all these points. The great judge above quoted says, “There are\r\nsome young fanciers who are over-covetous, who go for all the above\r\nfive properties at once; they have their reward by getting nothing.” We\r\nthus see that breeding even fancy pigeons is no simple art: we may\r\nsmile at the solemnity of these precepts, but he who laughs will win no\r\nprizes.\r\n\r\nWhat methodical selection has effected for our animals is sufficiently\r\nproved, as already remarked, by our Exhibitions. So greatly were the\r\nsheep belonging to some of the earlier breeders, such as Bakewell and\r\nLord Western, changed, that many persons could not be persuaded that\r\nthey had not been crossed. Our pigs, as Mr. Corringham remarks[19]\r\nduring the last twenty years have undergone, through rigorous selection\r\ntogether with crossing, a complete metamorphosis. The first exhibition\r\nfor poultry was held in the Zoological Gardens in 1845; and the\r\nimprovement effected since that time has been great. As Mr. Bailey, the\r\ngreat judge, remarked to me, it was formerly ordered that the comb of\r\nthe Spanish cock should be upright, and in four or five years all good\r\nbirds had upright combs; it was ordered that the Polish cock should\r\nhave no comb or wattles, and now a bird thus furnished would be at once\r\ndisqualified; beards were ordered, and out of fifty-seven pens lately\r\n(1860) exhibited at the Crystal Palace, all had beards. So it has been\r\nin many other cases. But in all cases the judges order only what is\r\noccasionally produced and what can be improved and rendered constant by\r\nselection. The steady increase in weight during the last few years in\r\nour fowls, turkeys, ducks, and geese is notorious; “six-pound ducks are\r\nnow common, whereas four pounds was formerly the average.” As the time\r\nrequired to make a change has not often been recorded, it may be worth\r\nmentioning that it took Mr. Wicking thirteen years to put a clean white\r\nhead on an almond tumbler’s body, “a triumph,” says another fancier,\r\n“of which he may be justly proud.”[20]\r\n\r\nMr. Tollet, of Betley Hall, selected cows, and especially bulls,\r\ndescended from good milkers, for the sole purpose of improving his\r\ncattle for the production of cheese; he steadily tested the milk with\r\nthe lactometer, and in eight years he increased, as I was informed by\r\nhim, the product in proportion of four to three. Here is a curious\r\ncase[21] of steady but slow progress, with the end not as yet fully\r\nattained: in 1784 a race of silkworms was introduced into France, in\r\nwhich one hundred in the thousand failed to produce white cocoons; but\r\nnow after careful selection during sixty-five generations, the\r\nproportion of yellow cocoons has been reduced to thirty-five in the\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nWith plants selection has been followed with the same good result as\r\nwith animals. But the process is simpler, for plants in the great\r\nmajority of cases bear both sexes. Nevertheless, with most kinds it is\r\nnecessary to take as much care to prevent crosses as with animals or\r\nunisexual plants; but with some plants, such as peas, this care is not\r\nnecessary. With all improved plants, excepting of course those which\r\nare propagated by buds, cuttings, etc., it is almost indispensable to\r\nexamine the seedlings and destroy those which depart from the proper\r\ntype. This is called “roguing,” and is, in fact, a form of selection,\r\nlike the rejection of inferior animals. Experienced horticulturists and\r\nagriculturists incessantly urge every one to preserve the finest plants\r\nfor the production of seed.\r\n\r\nAlthough plants often present much more conspicuous variations than\r\nanimals, yet the closest attention is generally requisite to detect\r\neach slight and favourable change. Mr. Masters relates[22] how “many a\r\npatient hour was devoted,” whilst he was young, to the detection of\r\ndifferences in peas intended for seed. Mr. Barnet[23] remarks that the\r\nold scarlet American strawberry was cultivated for more than a century\r\nwithout producing a single variety; and another writer observes how\r\nsingular it was that when gardeners first began to attend to this fruit\r\nit began to vary; the truth no doubt being that it had always varied,\r\nbut that, until slight variations were selected and propagated by seed,\r\nno conspicuous result was obtained. The finest shades of difference in\r\nwheat have been discriminated and selected with almost as much care as,\r\nin the case of the higher animals, for instance by Col. Le Couteur and\r\nmore especially by Major Hallett.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to give a few examples of methodical selection\r\nwith plants; but in fact the great improvement of all our anciently\r\ncultivated plants may be attributed to selection long carried on, in\r\npart methodically, and in part unconsciously. I have shown in a former\r\nchapter how the weight of the gooseberry has been increased by\r\nsystematic selection and culture. The flowers of the Heartsease have\r\nbeen similarly increased in size and regularity of outline. With the\r\nCineraria, Mr. Glenny[24] “was bold enough when the flowers were ragged\r\nand starry and ill defined in colour, to fix a standard which was then\r\nconsidered outrageously high and impossible, and which, even if\r\nreached, it was said, we should be no gainers by, as it would spoil the\r\nbeauty of the flowers. He maintained that he was right; and the event\r\nhas proved it to be so.” The doubling of flowers has several times been\r\neffected by careful selection: the Rev. W. Williamson,[25] after sowing\r\nduring several years seed of _Anemone coronaria,_ found a plant with\r\none additional petal; he sowed the seed of this, and by perseverance in\r\nthe same course obtained several varieties with six or seven rows of\r\npetals. The single Scotch rose was doubled, and yielded eight good\r\nvarieties in nine or ten years.[26] The Canterbury bell (_Campanula\r\nmedium_) was doubled by careful selection in four generations.[27] In\r\nfour years Mr. Buckman,[28] by culture and careful selection, converted\r\nparsnips, raised from wild seed, into a new and good variety. By\r\nselection during a long course of years, the early maturity of peas has\r\nbeen hastened by between ten and twenty-one days.[29] A more curious\r\ncase is offered by the beet plant, which since its cultivation in\r\nFrance, has almost exactly doubled its yield of sugar. This has been\r\neffected by the most careful selection; the specific gravity of the\r\nroots being regularly tested, and the best roots saved for the\r\nproduction of seed.[30]\r\n\r\n      _Selection by Ancient and Semi-civilised People._\r\n\r\nIn attributing so much importance to the selection of animals and\r\nplants, it may be objected, that methodical selection would not have\r\nbeen carried on during ancient times. A distinguished naturalist\r\nconsiders it as absurd to suppose that semi-civilised people should\r\nhave practised selection of any kind. Undoubtedly the principle has\r\nbeen systematically acknowledged and followed to a far greater extent\r\nwithin the last hundred years than at any former period, and a\r\ncorresponding result has been gained; but it would be a greater error\r\nto suppose, as we shall immediately see, that its importance was not\r\nrecognised and acted on during the most ancient times, and by\r\nsemi-civilised people. I should premise that many facts now to be given\r\nonly show that care was taken in breeding; but when this is the case,\r\nselection is almost sure to be practised to a certain extent. We shall\r\nhereafter be enabled better to judge how far selection, when only\r\noccasionally carried on, by a few of the inhabitants of a country, will\r\nslowly produce a great effect.\r\n\r\nIn a well-known passage in the thirtieth chapter of Genesis, rules are\r\ngiven for influencing, as was then thought possible, the colour of\r\nsheep; and speckled and dark breeds are spoken of as being kept\r\nseparate. By the time of David the fleece was likened to snow.\r\nYouatt,[31] who has discussed all the passages in relation to breeding\r\nin the Old Testament, concludes that at this early period “some of the\r\nbest principles of breeding must have been steadily and long pursued.”\r\nIt was ordered, according to Moses, that “Thou shalt not let thy cattle\r\ngender with a diverse kind;” but mules were purchased[32] so that at\r\nthis early period other nations must have crossed the horse and ass. It\r\nis said[33] that Erichthonius, some generations before the Trojan war,\r\nhad many brood-mares, “which by his care and judgment in the choice of\r\nstallions produced a breed of horses superior to any in the surrounding\r\ncountries.” Homer (Book 5) speaks of Aeneas’ horses as bred from mares\r\nwhich were put to the steeds of Laomedon. Plato, in his ‘Republic’ says\r\nto Glaucus, “I see that you raise at your house a great many dogs for\r\nthe chase. Do you take care about breeding and pairing them? Among\r\nanimals of good blood, are there not always some which are superior to\r\nthe rest?” To which Glaucus answers in the affirmative.[34] Alexander\r\nthe Great selected the finest Indian cattle to send to Macedonia to\r\nimprove the breed.[35] According to Pliny,[36] King Pyrrhus had an\r\nespecially valuable breed of oxen: and he did not suffer the bulls and\r\ncows to come together till four years old, that the breed might not\r\ndegenerate. Virgil, in his Georgics (lib. 3), gives as strong advice as\r\nany modern agriculturist could do, carefully to select the breeding\r\nstock; “to note the tribe, the lineage, and the sire; whom to reserve\r\nfor husband of the herd;”—to brand the progeny;—to select sheep of the\r\npurest white, and to examine if their tongues are swarthy. We have seen\r\nthat the Romans kept pedigrees of their pigeons, and this would have\r\nbeen a senseless proceeding had not great care been taken in breeding\r\nthem. Columella gives detailed instructions about breeding fowls: “Let\r\nthe breeding hens therefore be of a choice colour, a robust body,\r\nsquare-built, full-breasted, with large heads, with upright and\r\nbright-red combs. Those are believed to be the best bred which have\r\nfive toes.”[37] According to Tacitus, the Celts attended to the races\r\nof their domestic animals; and Caesar states that they paid high prices\r\nto merchants for fine imported horses.[38] In regard to plants, Virgil\r\nspeaks of yearly culling the largest seeds; and Celsus says, “where the\r\ncorn and crop is but small, we must pick out the best ears of corn, and\r\nof them lay up our seed separately by itself.”[39]\r\n\r\nComing down the stream of time, we may be brief. At about the beginning\r\nof the ninth century Charlemagne expressly ordered his officers to take\r\ngreat care of his stallions; and if any proved bad or old, to forewarn\r\nhim in good time before they were put to the mares.[40] Even in a\r\ncountry so little civilised as Ireland during the ninth century, it\r\nwould appear from some ancient verses,[41] describing a ransom demanded\r\nby Cormac, that animals from particular places, or having a particular\r\ncharacter, were valued. Thus it is said,—\r\n\r\n      Two pigs of the pigs of Mac Lir,\r\n      A ram and ewe both round and red,\r\n      I brought with me from Aengus.\r\n      I brought with me a stallion and a mare\r\n      From the beautiful stud of Manannan,\r\n      A bull and a white cow from Druim Cain.\r\n\r\nAthelstan, in 930, received running-horses as a present from Germany;\r\nand he prohibited the exportation of English horses. King John imported\r\n“one hundred chosen stallions from Flanders.”[42] On June 16th, 1305,\r\nthe Prince of Wales wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, begging for\r\nthe loan of any choice stallion, and promising its return at the end of\r\nthe season.[43] There are numerous records at ancient periods in\r\nEnglish history of the importation of choice animals of various kinds,\r\nand of foolish laws against their exportation. In the reigns of Henry\r\nVII. and VIII. it was ordered that the magistrates, at Michaelmas,\r\nshould scour the heaths and commons, and destroy all mares beneath a\r\ncertain size.[44] Some of our earlier kings passed laws against the\r\nslaughtering rams of any good breed before they were seven years old,\r\nso that they might have time to breed. In Spain Cardinal Ximenes\r\nissued, in 1509, regulations on the _ selection_ of good rams for\r\nbreeding.[45]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Akbar Khan before the year l600 is said to have\r\n“wonderfully improved” his pigeons by crossing the breeds; and this\r\nnecessarily implies careful selection. About the same period the Dutch\r\nattended with the greatest care to the breeding of these birds. Belon\r\nin 1555 says that good managers in France examined the colour of their\r\ngoslings in order to get geese of a white colour and better kinds.\r\nMarkham in 1631 tells the breeder “to elect the largest and goodliest\r\nconies,” and enters into minute details. Even with respect to seeds of\r\nplants for the flower-garden, Sir J. Hanmer writing about the year\r\n1660[46] says, in “choosing seed, the best seed is the most weighty,\r\nand is had from the lustiest and most vigorous stems;” and he then\r\ngives rules about leaving only a few flowers on plants for seed; so\r\nthat even such details were attended to in our flower-gardens two\r\nhundred years ago. In order to show that selection has been silently\r\ncarried on in places where it would not have been expected, I may add\r\nthat in the middle of the last century, in a remote part of North\r\nAmerica, Mr. Cooper improved by careful selection all his vegetables,\r\n“so that they were greatly superior to those of any other person. When\r\nhis radishes, for instance, are fit for use, he takes ten or twelve\r\nthat he most approves, and plants them at least 100 yards from others\r\nthat blossom at the same time. In the same manner he treats all his\r\nother plants, varying the circumstances according to their nature.”[47]\r\n\r\nIn the great work on China published in the last century by the\r\nJesuits, and which is chiefly compiled from ancient Chinese\r\nencyclopaedias, it is said that with sheep “improving the breed\r\nconsists in choosing with particular care the lambs which are destined\r\nfor propagation, in nourishing them well, and in keeping the flocks\r\nseparate.” The same principles were applied by the Chinese to various\r\nplants and fruit-trees.[48] An imperial edict recommends the choice of\r\nseed of remarkable size; and selection was practised even by imperial\r\nhands, for it is said that the Ya-mi, or imperial rice, was noticed at\r\nan ancient period in a field by the Emperor Khang-hi, was saved and\r\ncultivated in his garden, and has since become valuable from being the\r\nonly kind which will grow north of the Great Wall.[49] Even with\r\nflowers, the tree paeony (_P. moutan_) has been cultivated, according\r\nto Chinese traditions, for 1400 years; between 200 and 300 varieties\r\nhave been raised, which are cherished like tulips formerly were by the\r\nDutch.[50]\r\n\r\nTurning now to semi-civilised people and to savages: it occurred to me,\r\nfrom what I had seen of several parts of South America, where fences do\r\nnot exist, and where the animals are of little value, that there would\r\nbe absolutely no care in breeding or selecting them; and this to a\r\nlarge extent is true. Roulin,[51] however, describes in Columbia a\r\nnaked race of cattle, which are not allowed to increase, on account of\r\ntheir delicate constitution. According to Azara[52] horses are often\r\nborn in Paraguay with curly hair; but, as the natives do not like them,\r\nthey are destroyed. On the other hand, Azara states that a hornless\r\nbull, born in 1770, was preserved and propagated its race. I was\r\ninformed of the existence in Banda Oriental of a breed with reversed\r\nhair; and the extraordinary niata cattle first appeared and have since\r\nbeen kept distinct in La Plata. Hence certain conspicuous variations\r\nhave been preserved, and others have been habitually destroyed, in\r\nthese countries, which are so little favourable for careful selection.\r\nWe have also seen that the inhabitants sometimes introduce fresh cattle\r\non their estates to prevent the evil effects of close interbreeding. On\r\nthe other hand, I have heard on reliable authority that the Gauchos of\r\nthe Pampas never take any pains in selecting the best bulls or\r\nstallions for breeding; and this probably accounts for the cattle and\r\nhorses being remarkably uniform in character throughout the immense\r\nrange of the Argentine republic.\r\n\r\nLooking to the Old World, in the Sahara Desert “The Touareg is as\r\ncareful in the selection of his breeding Mahari (a fine race of the\r\ndromedary) as the Arab is in that of his horse. The pedigrees are\r\nhanded down, and many a dromedary can boast a genealogy far longer than\r\nthe descendants of the Darley Arabian.”[53] According to Pallas the\r\nMongolians endeavour to breed the Yaks or horse-tailed buffaloes with\r\nwhite tails, for these are sold to the Chinese mandarins as\r\nfly-flappers; and Moorcroft, about seventy years after Pallas, found\r\nthat white-tailed animals were still selected for breeding.[54]\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the chapter on the Dog that savages in different parts\r\nof North America and in Guiana cross their dogs with wild Canidæ, as\r\ndid the ancient Gauls, according to Pliny. This was done to give their\r\ndogs strength and vigour, in the same way as the keepers in large\r\nwarrens now sometimes cross their ferrets (as I have been informed by\r\nMr. Yarrell) with the wild polecat, “to give them more devil.”\r\nAccording to Varro, the wild ass was formerly caught and crossed with\r\nthe tame animal to improve the breed, in the same manner as at the\r\npresent day the natives of Java sometimes drive their cattle into the\r\nforests to cross with the wild Banteng (_Bos sondaicus_).[55] In\r\nNorthern Siberia, among the Ostyaks, the dogs vary in markings in\r\ndifferent districts, but in each place they are spotted black and white\r\nin a remarkably uniform manner;[56] and from this fact alone we may\r\ninfer careful breeding, more especially as the dogs of one locality are\r\nfamed throughout the country for their superiority. I have heard of\r\ncertain tribes of Esquimaux who take pride in their teams of dogs being\r\nuniformly coloured. In Guiana, as Sir H. Schomburgk informs me,[57] the\r\ndogs of the Turuma Indians are highly valued and extensively bartered:\r\nthe price of a good one is the same as that given for a wife: they are\r\nkept in a sort of cage, and the Indians “take great care when the\r\nfemale is in season to prevent her uniting with a dog of an inferior\r\ndescription.” The Indians told Sir Robert that, if a dog proved bad or\r\nuseless, he was not killed, but was left to die from sheer neglect.\r\nHardly any nation is more barbarous than the Fuegians, but I hear from\r\nMr. Bridges, the Catechist to the Mission, that, “when these savages\r\nhave a large, strong, and active bitch, they take care to put her to a\r\nfine dog, and even take care to feed her well, that her young may be\r\nstrong and well favoured.”\r\n\r\nIn the interior of Africa, negroes, who have not associated with white\r\nmen, show great anxiety to improve their animals; they “always choose\r\nthe larger and stronger males for stock;” the Malakolo were much\r\npleased at Livingstone’s promise to send them a bull, and some Bakalolo\r\ncarried a live cock all the way from Loanda into the interior.[58] At\r\nFalaba Mr. Winwood Reade noticed an unusually fine horse, and the negro\r\nKing informed him that “the owner was noted for his skill in breeding\r\nhorses.” Further south on the same continent, Andersson states that he\r\nhas known a Damara give two fine oxen for a dog which struck his fancy.\r\nThe Damaras take great delight in having whole droves of cattle of the\r\nsame colour, and they prize their oxen in proportion to the size of\r\ntheir horns. “The Namaquas have a perfect mania for a uniform team; and\r\nalmost all the people of Southern Africa value their cattle next to\r\ntheir women, and take a pride in possessing animals that look\r\nhigh-bred. They rarely or never make use of a handsome animal as a\r\nbeast of burden.”[59] The power of discrimination which these savages\r\npossess is wonderful, and they can recognise to which tribe any cattle\r\nbelong. Mr. Andersson further informs me that the natives frequently\r\nmatch a particular bull with a particular cow.\r\n\r\nThe most curious case of selection by semi-civilised people, or indeed\r\nby any people, which I have found recorded, is that given by Garcilazo\r\nde la Vega, a descendant of the Incas, as having been practised in Peru\r\nbefore the country was subjugated by the Spaniards.[60] The Incas\r\nannually held great hunts, when all the wild animals were driven from\r\nan immense circuit to a central point. The beasts of prey were first\r\ndestroyed as injurious. The wild Guanacos and Vicunas were sheared; the\r\nold males and females killed, and the others set at liberty. The\r\nvarious kinds of deer were examined; the old males and females were\r\nlikewise killed, “but the young females, with a certain number of\r\nmales, selected from the most beautiful and strong,” were given their\r\nfreedom. Here, then, we have selection by man aiding natural selection.\r\nSo that the Incas followed exactly the reverse system of that which our\r\nScottish sportsman are accused of following, namely, of steadily\r\nkilling the finest stags, thus causing the whole race to\r\ndegenerate.[61] In regard to the domesticated llamas and alpacas, they\r\nwere separated in the time of the Incas according to colour: and if by\r\nchance one in a flock was born of the wrong colour, it was eventually\r\nput into another flock.\r\n\r\nIn the genus Auchenia there are four forms,—the Guanaco and Vicuna,\r\nfound wild and undoubtedly distinct species; the Llama and Alpaca,\r\nknown only in a domesticated condition. These four animals appear so\r\ndifferent, that most naturalists, especially those who have studied\r\nthese animals in their native country, maintain that they are\r\nspecifically distinct, notwithstanding that no one pretends to have\r\nseen a wild llama or alpaca. Mr. Ledger, however, who has closely\r\nstudied these animals both in Peru and during their exportation to\r\nAustralia, and who has made many experiments on their propagation,\r\nadduces arguments[62] which seem to me conclusive, that the llama is\r\nthe domesticated descendant of the guanaco, and the alpaca of the\r\nvicuna. And now that we know that these animals were systematically\r\nbred and selected many centuries ago, there is nothing surprising in\r\nthe great amount of change which they have undergone.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me at one time probable that, though ancient and\r\nsemi-civilised people might have attended to the improvement of their\r\nmore useful animals in essential points, yet that they would have\r\ndisregarded unimportant characters. But human nature is the same\r\nthroughout the world: fashion everywhere reigns supreme, and man is apt\r\nto value whatever he may chance to possess. We have seen that in South\r\nAmerica the niata cattle, which certainly are not made useful by their\r\nshortened faces and upturned nostrils, have been preserved. The Damaras\r\nof South Africa value their cattle for uniformity of colour and\r\nenormously long horns. And I will now show that there is hardly any\r\npeculiarity in our most useful animals which, from fashion,\r\nsuperstition, or some other motive, has not been valued, and\r\nconsequently preserved. With respect to cattle, “an early record,”\r\naccording to Youatt[63] “speaks of a hundred white cows with red ears\r\nbeing demanded as a compensation by the princes of North and South\r\nWales. If the cattle were of a dark or black colour, 150 were to be\r\npresented.” So that colour was attended to in Wales before its\r\nsubjugation by England. In Central Africa, an ox that beats the ground\r\nwith its tail is killed; and in South Africa some of the Damaras will\r\nnot eat the flesh of a spotted ox. The Kaffirs value an animal with a\r\nmusical voice; and “at a sale in British Kaffraria the low of a heifer\r\nexcited so much admiration that a sharp competition sprung up for her\r\npossession, and she realised a considerable price.”[64] With respect to\r\nsheep, the Chinese prefer rams without horns; the Tartars prefer them\r\nwith spirally wound horns, because the hornless are thought to lose\r\ncourage.[65] Some of the Damaras will not eat the flesh of hornless\r\nsheep. In regard to horses, at the end of the fifteenth century animals\r\nof the colour described as liart pomme were most valued in France. The\r\nArabs have a proverb, “Never buy a horse with four white feet, for he\r\ncarries his shroud with him”;[66] the Arabs also, as we have seen,\r\ndespise dun-coloured horses. So with dogs, Xenophon and others at an\r\nancient period were prejudiced in favour of certain colours; and “white\r\nor slate-coloured hunting dogs were not esteemed.”[67]\r\n\r\nTurning to poultry, the old Roman gourmands thought that the liver of a\r\nwhite goose was the most savoury. In Paraguay black-skinned fowls are\r\nkept because they are thought to be more productive, and their flesh\r\nthe most proper for invalids.[68] In Guiana, as I am informed by Sir R.\r\nSchomburgk, the aborigines will not eat the flesh or eggs of the fowl,\r\nbut two races are kept distinct merely for ornament. In the\r\nPhilippines, no less than nine sub-varieties of the game-cock are kept\r\nand named, so that they must be separately bred.\r\n\r\nAt the present time in Europe, the smallest peculiarities are carefully\r\nattended to in our most useful animals, either from fashion, or as a\r\nmark of purity of blood. Many examples could be given; two will\r\nsuffice. “In the Western counties of England the prejudice against a\r\nwhite pig is nearly as strong as against a black one in Yorkshire.” In\r\none of the Berkshire sub-breeds, it is said, “the white should be\r\nconfined to four white feet, a white spot between the eyes, and a few\r\nwhite hairs behind each shoulder.” Mr. Saddler possessed “three hundred\r\npigs, every one of which was marked in this manner.”[69] Marshall,\r\ntowards the close of the last century, in speaking of a change in one\r\nof the Yorkshire breeds of cattle, says the horns have been\r\nconsiderably modified, as “a clean, small, sharp horn has been\r\n_fashionable_ for the last twenty years.”[70] In a part of Germany the\r\ncattle of the Race de Gfoehl are valued for many good qualities, but\r\nthey must have horns of a particular curvature and tint, so much so\r\nthat mechanical means are applied if they take a wrong direction; but\r\nthe inhabitants “consider it of the highest importance that the\r\nnostrils of the bull should be flesh-coloured, and the eyelashes light;\r\nthis is an indispensable condition. A calf with blue nostrils would not\r\nbe purchased, or purchased at a very low price.”[71] Therefore let no\r\nman say that any point or character is too trifling to be methodically\r\nattended to and selected by breeders.\r\n\r\n_Unconscious Selection._—By this term I mean, as already more than once\r\nexplained, the preservation by man of the most valued, and the\r\ndestruction of the least valued individuals, without any conscious\r\nintention on his part of altering the breed. It is difficult to offer\r\ndirect proofs of the results which follow from this kind of selection;\r\nbut the indirect evidence is abundant. In fact, except that in the one\r\ncase man acts intentionally, and in the other unintentionally, there is\r\nlittle difference between methodical and unconscious selection. In both\r\ncases man preserves the animals which are most useful or pleasing to\r\nhim, and destroys or neglects the others. But no doubt a far more rapid\r\nresult follows from methodical than from unconscious selection. The\r\n“roguing” of plants by gardeners, and the destruction by law in Henry\r\nVIII.’s reign of all under-sized mares, are instances of a process the\r\nreverse of selection in the ordinary sense of the word, but leading to\r\nthe same general result. The influence of the destruction of\r\nindividuals having a particular character is well shown by the\r\nnecessity of killing every lamb with a trace of black about it, in\r\norder to keep the flock white; or again, by the effects on the average\r\nheight of the men of France of the destructive wars of Napoleon, by\r\nwhich many tall men were killed, the short ones being left to be the\r\nfathers of families. This at least is the conclusion of some of those\r\nwho have closely studied the effects of the conscription; and it is\r\ncertain that since Napoleon’s time the standard for the army has been\r\nlowered two or three times.\r\n\r\nUnconscious selection blends with methodical, so that it is scarcely\r\npossible to separate them. When a fancier long ago first happened to\r\nnotice a pigeon with an unusually short beak, or one with the\r\ntail-feathers unusually developed, although he bred from these birds\r\nwith the distinct intention of propagating the variety, yet he could\r\nnot have intended to make a short-faced tumbler or a fantail, and was\r\nfar from knowing that he had made the first step towards this end. If\r\nhe could have seen the final result, he would have been struck with\r\nastonishment, but, from what we know of the habits of fanciers,\r\nprobably not with admiration. Our English carriers, barbs, and\r\nshort-faced tumblers have been greatly modified in the same manner, as\r\nwe may infer both from the historical evidence given in the chapters on\r\nthe Pigeon, and from the comparison of birds brought from distant\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nSo it has been with dogs; our present fox-hounds differ from the old\r\nEnglish hound; our greyhounds have become lighter: the Scotch\r\ndeer-hound has been modified, and is now rare. Our bulldogs differ from\r\nthose which were formerly used for baiting bulls. Our pointers and\r\nNewfoundlands do not closely resemble any native dog now found in the\r\ncountries whence they were brought. These changes have been effected\r\npartly by crosses; but in every case the result has been governed by\r\nthe strictest selection. Nevertheless, there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat man intentionally and methodically made the breeds exactly what\r\nthey now are. As our horses became fleeter, and the country more\r\ncultivated and smoother, fleeter fox-hounds were desired and produced,\r\nbut probably without any one distinctly foreseeing what they would\r\nbecome. Our pointers and setters, the latter almost certainly descended\r\nfrom large spaniels, have been greatly modified in accordance with\r\nfashion and the desire for increased speed. Wolves have become extinct,\r\nand so has the wolf-dog; deer have become rarer, bulls are no longer\r\nbaited, and the corresponding breeds of the dog have answered to the\r\nchange. But we may feel almost sure that when, for instance, bulls were\r\nno longer baited, no man said to himself, I will now breed my dogs of\r\nsmaller size, and thus create the present race. As circumstances\r\nchanged, men unconsciously and slowly modified their course of\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nWith racehorses selection for swiftness has been followed methodically,\r\nand our horses now easily surpass their progenitors. The increased size\r\nand different appearance of the English racehorse led a good observer\r\nin India to ask, “Could any one in this year of 1856, looking at our\r\nracehorses, conceive that they were the result of the union of the Arab\r\nhorse and the African mare?”[72] This change has, it is probable, been\r\nlargely effected through unconscious selection, that is, by the general\r\nwish to breed as fine horses as possible in each generation, combined\r\nwith training and high feeding, but without any intention to give to\r\nthem their present appearance. According to Youatt,[73] the\r\nintroduction in Oliver Cromwell’s time of three celebrated Eastern\r\nstallions speedily affected the English breed; “so that Lord Harleigh,\r\none of the old school, complained that the great horse was fast\r\ndisappearing.” This is an excellent proof how carefully selection must\r\nhave been attended to; for without such care, all traces of so small an\r\ninfusion of Eastern blood would soon have been absorbed and lost.\r\nNotwithstanding that the climate of England has never been esteemed\r\nparticularly favourable to the horse, yet long-continued selection,\r\nboth methodical and unconscious, together with that practised by the\r\nArabs during a still longer and earlier period, has ended in giving us\r\nthe best breed of horses in the world. Macaulay[74] remarks, “Two men\r\nwhose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem, the Duke of\r\nNewcastle and Sir John Fenwick, pronounced that the meanest hack ever\r\nimported from Tangier would produce a finer progeny than could be\r\nexpected from the best sire of our native breed. They would not readily\r\nhave believed that a time would come when the princes and nobles of\r\nneighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses from England as\r\never the English had been to obtain horses from Barbary.”\r\n\r\nThe London dray-horse, which differs so much in appearance from any\r\nnatural species, and which from its size has so astonished many Eastern\r\nprinces, was probably formed by the heaviest and most powerful animals\r\nhaving been selected during many generations in Flanders and England,\r\nbut without the least intention or expectation of creating a horse such\r\nas we now see. If we go back to an early period of history, we behold\r\nin the antique Greek statues, as Schaaffhausen has remarked,[75] a\r\nhorse equally unlike a race or dray horse, and differing from any\r\nexisting breed.\r\n\r\nThe results of unconscious selection, in an early stage, are well shown\r\nin the difference between the flocks descended from the same stock, but\r\nseparately reared by careful breeders. Youatt gives an excellent\r\ninstance of this fact in the sheep belonging to Messrs. Buckley and\r\nBurgess, which “have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr.\r\nBakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion existing\r\nin the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the\r\nowner of either flock has deviated in any one instance from the pure\r\nblood of Mr. Bakewell’s flock; yet the difference between the sheep\r\npossessed by these two gentlemen is so great, that they have the\r\nappearance of being quite different varieties.”[76] I have seen several\r\nanalogous and well marked cases with pigeons: for instance, I had a\r\nfamily of barbs descended from those long bred by Sir J. Sebright, and\r\nanother family long bred by another fancier, and the two families\r\nplainly differed from each other. Nathusius—and a more competent\r\nwitness could not be cited—observes that, though the Shorthorns are\r\nremarkably uniform in appearance (except in colour), yet the individual\r\ncharacter and wishes of each breeder become impressed on his cattle, so\r\nthat different herds differ slightly from one another.[77] The Hereford\r\ncattle assumed their present well-marked character soon after the year\r\n1769, through careful selection by Mr. Tomkins[78] and the breed has\r\nlately split into two strains—one strain having a white face, and\r\ndiffering slightly, it is said,[79] in some other points: but there is\r\nno reason to believe that this split, the origin of which is unknown,\r\nwas intentionally made; it may with much more probability be attributed\r\nto different breeders having attended to different points. So again,\r\nthe Berkshire breed of swine in the year 1810 had greatly changed from\r\nwhat it was in 1780; and since 1810 at least two distinct sub-breeds\r\nhave arisen bearing the same name.[80] Keeping in mind how rapidly all\r\nanimals increase, and that some must be annually slaughtered and some\r\nsaved for breeding, then, if the same breeder during a long course of\r\nyears deliberately settles which shall be saved and which shall be\r\nkilled, it is almost inevitable that his individual turn of mind will\r\ninfluence the character of his stock, without his having had any\r\nintention to modify the breed.\r\n\r\nUnconscious selection in the strictest sense of the word, that is, the\r\nsaving of the more useful animals and the neglect or slaughter of the\r\nless useful, without any thought of the future, must have gone on\r\noccasionally from the remotest period and amongst the most barbarous\r\nnations. Savages often suffer from famines, and are sometimes expelled\r\nby war from their own homes. In such cases it can hardly be doubted\r\nthat they would save their most useful animals. When the Fuegians are\r\nhard pressed by want, they kill their old women for food rather than\r\ntheir dogs; for, as we were assured, “old women no use—dogs catch\r\notters.” The same sound sense would surely lead them to preserve their\r\nmore useful dogs when still harder pressed by famine. Mr. Oldfield, who\r\nhas seen so much of the aborigines of Australia, informs me that “they\r\nare all very glad to get a European kangaroo dog, and several instances\r\nhave been known of the father killing his own infant that the mother\r\nmight suckle the much-prized puppy.” Different kinds of dogs would be\r\nuseful to the Australian for hunting opossums and kangaroos, and to the\r\nFuegian for catching fish and otters; and the occasional preservation\r\nin the two countries of the most useful animals would ultimately lead\r\nto the formation of two widely distinct breeds.\r\n\r\nWith plants, from the earliest dawn of civilisation, the best variety\r\nwhich was known would generally have been cultivated at each period and\r\nits seeds occasionally sown; so that there will have been some\r\nselection from an extremely remote period, but without any prefixed\r\nstandard of excellence or thought of the future. We at the present day\r\nprofit by a course of selection occasionally and unconsciously carried\r\non during thousands of years. This is proved in an interesting manner\r\nby Oswald Heer’s researches on the lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, as\r\ngiven in a former chapter; for he shows that the grain and seed of our\r\npresent varieties of wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, lentils, and\r\npoppy, exceed in size those which were cultivated in Switzerland during\r\nthe Neolithic and Bronze periods. These ancient people, during the\r\nNeolithic period, possessed also a crab considerably larger than that\r\nnow growing wild on the Jura.[81] The pears described by Pliny were\r\nevidently extremely inferior in quality to our present pears. We can\r\nrealise the effects of long-continued selection and cultivation in\r\nanother way, for would any one in his senses expect to raise a\r\nfirst-rate apple from the seed of a truly wild crab, or a luscious\r\nmelting pear from the wild pear? Alphonse de Candolle informs me that\r\nhe has lately seen on an ancient mosaic at Rome a representation of the\r\nmelon; and as the Rotnans, who were such gourmands, are silent on this\r\nfruit, he infers that the melon has been greatly ameliorated since the\r\nclassical period.\r\n\r\nComing to later times, Buffon[82] on comparing the flowers, fruit, and\r\nvegetables which were then cultivated with some excellent drawings made\r\na hundred and fifty years previously, was struck with surprise at the\r\ngreat improvement which had been effected; and remarks that these\r\nancient flowers and vegetables would now be rejected, not only by a\r\nflorist but by a village gardener. Since the time of Buffon the work of\r\nimprovement has steadily and rapidly gone on. Every florist who\r\ncompares our present flowers with those figured in books published not\r\nlong since, is astonished at the change. A well-known amateur,[83] in\r\nspeaking of the varieties of Pelargonium raised by Mr. Garth only\r\ntwenty-two years before, remarks, “What a rage they excited: surely we\r\nhad attained perfection, it was said; and now not one of the flowers of\r\nthose days will be looked at. But none the less is the debt of\r\ngratitude which we owe to those who saw what was to be done, and did\r\nit.” Mr. Paul, the well-known horticulturist, in writing of the same\r\nflower,[84] says he remembers when young being delighted with the\r\nportraits in Sweet’s work; “but what are they in point of beauty\r\ncompared with the Pelargoniums of this day? Here again nature did not\r\nadvance by leaps; the improvement was gradual, and if we had neglected\r\nthose very gradual advances, we must have foregone the present grand\r\nresults.” How well this practical horticulturist appreciates and\r\nillustrates the gradual and accumulative force of selection! The Dahlia\r\nhas advanced in beauty in a like manner; the line of improvement being\r\nguided by fashion, and by the successive modifications which the flower\r\nslowly underwent.[85] A steady and gradual change has been noticed in\r\nmany other flowers: thus an old florist,[86] after describing the\r\nleading varieties of the Pink which were grown in 1813 adds, “the pinks\r\nof those days would now be scarcely grown as border-flowers.” The\r\nimprovement of so many flowers and the number of the varieties which\r\nhave been raised is all the more striking when we hear that the\r\nearliest known flower-garden in Europe, namely at Padua, dates only\r\nfrom the year 1545.[87]\r\n\r\n_Effects of Selection, as shown by the parts most valued by man\r\npresenting the greatest amount of difference._—The power of\r\nlong-continued selection, whether methodical or unconscious, or both\r\ncombined, is well shown in a general way, namely, by the comparison of\r\nthe differences between the varieties of distinct species, which are\r\nvalued for different parts, such as for the leaves, or stems, or\r\ntubers, the seed, or fruit, or flowers. Whatever part man values most,\r\nthat part will be found to present the greatest amount of difference.\r\nWith trees cultivated for their fruit, Sageret remarks that the fruit\r\nis larger than in the parent-species, whilst with those cultivated for\r\nthe seed, as with nuts, walnuts, almonds, chestnuts, etc., it is the\r\nseed itself which is larger; and he accounts for this fact by the fruit\r\nin the one case, and by the seed in the other, having been carefully\r\nattended to and selected during many ages. Gallesio has made the same\r\nobservation. Godron insists on the diversity of the tuber in the\r\npotato, of the bulb in the onion, and of the fruit in the melon; and on\r\nthe close similarity of the other parts in these same plants.[88]\r\n\r\nIn order to judge how far my own impression on this subject was\r\ncorrect, I cultivated numerous varieties of the same species close to\r\none another. The comparison of the amount of difference between widely\r\ndifferent organs is necessarily vague; I will therefore give the\r\nresults in only a few cases. We have previously seen in the ninth\r\nchapter how greatly the varieties of the cabbage differ in their\r\nfoliage and stems, which are the selected parts, and how closely they\r\nresemble one another in their flowers, capsules, and seeds. In seven\r\nvarieties of the radish, the roots differed greatly in colour and\r\nshape, but no difference whatever could be detected in their foliage,\r\nflowers, or seeds. Now what a contrast is presented, if we compare the\r\nflowers of the varieties of these two plants with those of any species\r\ncultivated in our flower-gardens for ornament; or if we compare their\r\nseeds with those of the varieties of maize, peas, beans, etc., which\r\nare valued and cultivated for their seeds. In the ninth chapter it was\r\nshown that the varieties of the pea differ but little except in the\r\ntallness of the plant, moderately in the shape of the pod, and greatly\r\nin the pea itself, and these are all selected points. The varieties,\r\nhowever, of the _Pois sans parchemin_ differ much more in their pods,\r\nand these are eaten and valued. I cultivated twelve varieties of the\r\ncommon bean; one alone, the Dwarf Fan, differed considerably in general\r\nappearance; two differed in the colour of their flowers, one being an\r\nalbino, and the other being wholly instead of partially purple; several\r\ndiffered considerably in the shape and size of the pod, but far more in\r\nthe bean itself, and this is the valued and selected part. Toker’s\r\nbean, for instance, is twice-and-a-half as long and broad as the\r\nhorse-bean, and is much thinner and of a different shape.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the gooseberry, as formerly described, differ much in\r\ntheir fruit, but hardly perceptibly in their flowers or organs of\r\nvegetation. With the plum, the differences likewise appear to be\r\ngreater in the fruit than in the flowers or leaves. On the other hand,\r\nthe seed of the strawberry, which corresponds with the fruit of the\r\nplum, differs hardly at all; whilst every one knows how greatly the\r\nfruit—that is, the enlarged receptacle—differs in several varieties. In\r\napples, pears, and peaches the flowers and leaves differ considerably,\r\nbut not, as far as I can judge, in proportion with the fruit. The\r\nChinese double-flowering peaches, on the other hand, show that\r\nvarieties of this tree have been formed, which differ more in flower\r\nthan in fruit. If, as is highly probable, the peach is the modified\r\ndescent of the almond, a surprising amount of change has been effected\r\nin the same species, in the fleshy covering of the former and in the\r\nkernels of the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen parts stand in close relationship to each other, such as the seed\r\nand the fleshy covering of the fruit (whatever its homological nature\r\nmay be), changes in the one are usually accompanied by modifications in\r\nthe other, though not necessarily to the same degree. With the\r\nplum-tree, for instance, some varieties produce plums which are nearly\r\nalike, but include stones extremely dissimilar in shape; whilst\r\nconversely other varieties produce dissimilar fruit with barely\r\ndistinguishable stones; and generally the stones, though they have\r\nnever been subjected to selection, differ greatly in the several\r\nvarieties of the plum. In other cases organs which are not manifestly\r\nrelated, through some unknown bond vary together, and are consequently\r\nliable, without any intention on man’s part, to be simultaneously acted\r\non by selection. Thus the varieties of the stock (Matthiola) have been\r\nselected solely for the beauty of their flowers, but the seeds differ\r\ngreatly in colour and somewhat in size. Varieties of the lettuce have\r\nbeen selected solely on account of their leaves, yet produce seeds\r\nwhich likewise differ in colour. Generally, through the law of\r\ncorrelation, when a variety differs greatly from its fellow-varieties\r\nin any one character, it differs to a certain extent in several other\r\ncharacters. I observed this fact when I cultivated together many\r\nvarieties of the same species, for I used first to make a list of the\r\nvarieties which differed most from each other in their foliage and\r\nmanner of growth, afterwards of those that differed most in their\r\nflowers, then in their seed-capsules, and lastly in their mature seed;\r\nand I found that the same names generally occurred in two, three, or\r\nfour of the successive lists. Nevertheless the greatest amount of\r\ndifference between the varieties was always exhibited, as far as I\r\ncould judge, by that part or organ for which the plant was cultivated.\r\n\r\nWhen we bear in mind that each plant was at first cultivated because\r\nuseful to man, and that its variation was a subsequent, often a long\r\nsubsequent, event, we cannot explain the greater amount of diversity in\r\nthe valuable parts by supposing that species endowed with an especial\r\ntendency to vary in any particular manner were originally chosen. We\r\nmust attribute the result to the variations in these parts having been\r\nsuccessively preserved, and thus continually augmented; whilst other\r\nvariations, excepting such as inevitably appeared through correlation,\r\nwere neglected and lost. We may therefore infer that most plants might\r\nbe made, through long-continued selection, to yield races as different\r\nfrom one another in any character as they now are in those parts for\r\nwhich they are valued and cultivated.\r\n\r\nWith animals we see nothing of the same kind; but a sufficient number\r\nof species have not been domesticated for a fair comparison. Sheep are\r\nvalued for their wool, and the wool differs much more in the several\r\nraces than the hair in cattle. Neither sheep, goats, European cattle,\r\nnor pigs are valued for their fleetness or strength; and we do not\r\npossess breeds differing in these respects like the racehorse and\r\ndray-horse. But fleetness and strength are valued in camels and dogs;\r\nand we have with the former the swift dromedary and heavy camel; with\r\nthe latter the greyhound and mastiff. But dogs are valued even in a\r\nhigher degree for their mental qualities and senses; and every one\r\nknows how greatly the races differ in these respects. On the other\r\nhand, where the dog is kept solely to serve for food, as in the\r\nPolynesian islands and China, it is described as an extremely stupid\r\nanimal.[89] Blumenbach remarks that “many dogs, such as the badger-dog,\r\nhave a build so marked and so appropriate for particular purposes, that\r\nI should find it very difficult to persuade myself that this\r\nastonishing figure was an accidental consequence of degeneration.”[90]\r\nHad Blumenbach reflected on the great principle of selection, he would\r\nnot have used the term degeneration, and he would not have been\r\nastonished that dogs and other animals should become excellently\r\nadapted for the service of man.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we may conclude that whatever part or character is most\r\nvalued—whether the leaves, stems, tubers, bulbs, flowers, fruit, or\r\nseed of plants, or the size, strength, fleetness, hairy covering, or\r\nintellect of animals—that character will almost invariably be found to\r\npresent the greatest amount of difference both in kind and degree. And\r\nthis result may be safely attributed to man having preserved during a\r\nlong course of generations the variations which were useful to him, and\r\nneglected the others.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter by some remarks on an important subject.\r\nWith animals such as the giraffe, of which the whole structure is\r\nadmirably co-ordinated for certain purposes, it has been supposed that\r\nall the parts must have been simultaneously modified; and it has been\r\nargued that, on the principle of natural selection, this is scarcely\r\npossible. But in thus arguing, it has been tacitly assumed that the\r\nvariations must have been abrupt and great. No doubt, if the neck of a\r\nruminant were suddenly to become greatly elongated, the fore limbs and\r\nback would have to be simultaneously strengthened and modified; but it\r\ncannot be denied that an animal might have its neck, or head, or\r\ntongue, or fore-limbs elongated a very little without any corresponding\r\nmodification in other parts of the body; and animals thus slightly\r\nmodified would, during a dearth, have a slight advantage, and be\r\nenabled to browse on higher twigs, and thus survive. A few mouthfuls\r\nmore or less every day would make all the difference between life and\r\ndeath. By the repetition of the same process, and by the occasional\r\nintercrossing of the survivors, there would be some progress, slow and\r\nfluctuating though it would be, towards the admirably coordinated\r\nstructure of the giraffe. If the short-faced tumbler-pigeon, with its\r\nsmall conical beak, globular head, rounded body, short wings, and small\r\nfeet—characters which appear all in harmony—had been a natural species,\r\nits whole structure would have been viewed as well fitted for its life;\r\nbut in this case we know that inexperienced breeders are urged to\r\nattend to point after point, and not to attempt improving the whole\r\nstructure at the same time. Look at the greyhound, that perfect image\r\nof grace, symmetry, and vigour; no natural species can boast of a more\r\nadmirably co-ordinated structure, with its tapering head, slim body,\r\ndeep chest, tucked-up abdomen, rat-like tail, and long muscular limbs,\r\nall adapted for extreme fleetness, and for running down weak prey. Now,\r\nfrom what we see of the variability of animals, and from what we know\r\nof the method which different men follow in improving their stock—some\r\nchiefly attending to one point, others to another point, others again\r\ncorrecting defects by crosses, and so forth—we may feel assured that if\r\nwe could see the long line of ancestors of a first-rate greyhound up to\r\nits wild wolf-like progenitor, we should behold an infinite number of\r\nthe finest gradations, sometimes in one character and sometimes in\r\nanother, but all leading towards our present perfect type. By small and\r\ndoubtful steps such as these, nature, as we may confidently believe,\r\nhas progressed, on her grand march of improvement and development.\r\n\r\nA similar line of reasoning is as applicable to separate organs as to\r\nthe whole organisation. A writer[91] has recently maintained that “it\r\nis probably no exaggeration to suppose that in order to improve such an\r\norgan as the eye at all, it must be improved in ten different ways at\r\nonce. And the improbability of any complex organ being produced and\r\nbrought to perfection in any such way is an improbability of the same\r\nkind and degree as that of producing a poem or a mathematical\r\ndemonstration by throwing letters at random on a table.” If the eye\r\nwere abruptly and greatly modified, no doubt many parts would have to\r\nbe simultaneously altered, in order that the organ should remain\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nBut is this the case with smaller changes? There are persons who can\r\nsee distinctly only in a dull light, and this condition depends, I\r\nbelieve, on the abnormal sensitiveness of the retina, and is known to\r\nbe inherited. Now if a bird, for instance, receive some great advantage\r\nfrom seeing well in the twilight, all the individuals with the most\r\nsensitive retina would succeed best and be the most likely to survive;\r\nand why should not all those which happened to have the eye itself a\r\nlittle larger, or the pupil capable of greater dilatation, be likewise\r\npreserved, whether or not these modifications were strictly\r\nsimultaneous? These individuals would subsequently intercross and blend\r\ntheir respective advantages. By such slight successive changes, the eye\r\nof a diurnal bird would be brought into the condition of that of an\r\nowl, which has often been advanced as an excellent instance of\r\nadaptation. Short-sight, which is often inherited, permits a person to\r\nsee distinctly a minute object at so near a distance that it would be\r\nindistinct to ordinary eyes; and here we have a capacity which might be\r\nserviceable under certain conditions, abruptly gained. The Fuegians on\r\nboard the Beagle could certainly see distant objects more distinctly\r\nthan our sailors with all their long practice; I do not know whether\r\nthis depends upon sensitiveness or on the power of adjustment in the\r\nfocus; but this capacity for distant vision might, it is probable, be\r\nslightly augmented by successive modifications of either kind.\r\nAmphibious animals which are enabled to see both in the water and in\r\nthe air, require and possess, as M. Plateau has shown,[92] eyes\r\nconstructed on the following plan: “the cornea is always flat, or at\r\nleast much flattened in the front of the crystalline and over a space\r\nequal to the diameter of that lens, whilst the lateral portions may be\r\nmuch curved.” The crystalline is very nearly a sphere, and the humours\r\nhave nearly the same density as water. Now as a terrestrial animal\r\nbecame more and more aquatic in its habits, very slight changes, first\r\nin the curvature of the cornea or crystalline, and then in the density\r\nof the humours, or conversely, might successively occur, and would be\r\nadvantageous to the animal whilst under water, without serious\r\ndetriment to its power of vision in the air. It is of course impossible\r\nto conjecture by what steps the fundamental structure of the eye in the\r\nVertebrata was originally acquired, for we know nothing about this\r\norgan in the first progenitors of the class. With respect to the lowest\r\nanimals in the scale, the transitional states through which the eye at\r\nfirst probably passed, can by the aid of analogy be indicated, as I\r\nhave attempted to show in my ‘Origin of Species.’[93]\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] The term _unconscious selection_ has been objected to as a\r\n contradiction; but _see_ some excellent observations on this head by\r\n Prof. Huxley (‘Nat.

SELECTION, _continued._\r\n\r\nNATURAL SELECTION AS AFFECTING DOMESTIC PRODUCTIONS—CHARACTERS WHICH\r\nAPPEAR OF TRIFLING VALUE OFTEN OF REAL IMPORTANCE—CIRCUMSTANCES\r\nFAVOURABLE TO SELECTION BY MAN—FACILITY IN PREVENTING CROSSES, AND THE\r\nNATURE OF THE CONDITIONS—CLOSE ATTENTION AND PERSEVERANCE\r\nINDISPENSABLE—THE PRODUCTION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS\r\nESPECIALLY FAVOURABLE—WHEN NO SELECTION IS APPLIED, DISTINCT RACES ARE\r\nNOT FORMED—HIGHLY-BRED ANIMALS LIABLE TO DEGENERATION—TENDENCY IN MAN\r\nTO CARRY THE SELECTION OF EACH CHARACTER TO AN EXTREME POINT, LEADING\r\nTO DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER, RARELY TO CONVERGENCE—CHARACTERS CONTINUING\r\nTO VARY IN THE SAME DIRECTION IN WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY\r\nVARIED—DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER, WITH THE EXTINCTION OF INTERMEDIATE\r\nVARIETIES, LEADS TO DISTINCTNESS IN OUR DOMESTIC RACES—LIMIT TO THE\r\nPOWER OF SELECTION—LAPSE OF TIME IMPORTANT—MANNER IN WHICH DOMESTIC\r\nRACES HAVE ORIGINATED—SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest, as affecting\r\ndomestic productions._—We know little on this head. But as animals kept\r\nby savages have to provide throughout the year their own food either\r\nentirely or to a large extent, it can hardly be doubted that in\r\ndifferent countries, varieties differing in constitution and in various\r\ncharacters would succeed best, and so be naturally selected. Hence\r\nperhaps it is that the few domesticated animals kept by savages\r\npartake, as has been remarked by more than one writer, of the wild\r\nappearance of their masters, and likewise resemble natural species.\r\nEven in long-civilised countries, at least in the wilder parts, natural\r\nselection must act on our domestic races. It is obvious that varieties\r\nhaving very different habits, constitution, and structure, would\r\nsucceed best on mountains and on rich lowland pastures. For example,\r\nthe improved Leicester sheep were formerly taken to the Lammermuir\r\nHills; but an intelligent sheep-master reported that “our coarse lean\r\npastures were unequal to the task of supporting such heavy-bodied\r\nsheep; and they gradually dwindled away into less and less bulk: each\r\ngeneration was inferior to the preceding one; and when the spring was\r\nsevere, seldom more than two-thirds of the lambs survived the ravages\r\nof the storms.”[1] So with the mountain cattle of North Wales and the\r\nHebrides, it has been found that they could not withstand being crossed\r\nwith the larger and more delicate lowland breeds. Two French\r\nnaturalists, in describing the horses of Circassia, remark that,\r\nsubjected as they are to extreme vicissitudes of climate, having to\r\nsearch for scanty pasture, and exposed to constant danger from wolves,\r\nthe strongest and most vigorous alone survive.[2]\r\n\r\nEvery one must have been struck with the surpassing grace, strength,\r\nand vigour of the Game-cock, with its bold and confident air, its long,\r\nyet firm neck, compact body, powerful and closely pressed wings,\r\nmuscular thighs, strong beak massive at the base, dense and sharp spurs\r\nset low on the legs for delivering the fatal blow, and its compact,\r\nglossy, and mail-like plumage serving as a defence. Now the English\r\ngame-cock has not only been improved during many years by man’s careful\r\nselection, but in addition, as Mr. Tegetmeier has remarked,[3] by a\r\nkind of natural selection, for the strongest, most active and\r\ncourageous birds have stricken down their antagonists in the cockpit,\r\ngeneration after generation, and have subsequently served as the\r\nprogenitors of their race. The same kind of double selection has come\r\ninto play with the carrier pigeon, for during their training the\r\ninferior birds fail to return home and are lost, so that even without\r\nselection by man only the superior birds propagate their race.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, in former times, almost every district had its own\r\nbreed of cattle and sheep; “they were indigenous to the soil, climate,\r\nand pasturage of the locality on which they grazed: they seemed to have\r\nbeen formed for it and by it.”[4] But in this case we are quite unable\r\nto disentangle the effects of the direct action of the conditions of\r\nlife,—of use or habit—of natural selection—and of that kind of\r\nselection which we have seen is occasionally and unconsciously followed\r\nby man even during the rudest periods of history.\r\n\r\nLet us now look to the action of natural selection on special\r\ncharacters. Although nature is difficult to resist, yet man often\r\nstrives against her power, and sometimes with success. From the facts\r\nto be given, it will also be seen that natural selection would\r\npowerfully affect many of our domestic productions if left unprotected.\r\nThis is a point of much interest, for we thus learn that differences\r\napparently of very slight importance would certainly determine the\r\nsurvival of a form when forced to struggle for its own existence. It\r\nmay have occurred to some naturalists, as it formerly did to me, that,\r\nthough selection acting under natural conditions would determine the\r\nstructure of all important organs, yet that it could not affect\r\ncharacters which are esteemed by us of little importance; but this is\r\nan error to which we are eminently liable, from our ignorance of what\r\ncharacters are of real value to each living creature.\r\n\r\nWhen man attempts to make a breed with some serious defect in\r\nstructure, or in the mutual relation of the several parts, he will\r\npartly or completely fail, or encounter much difficulty; he is in fact\r\nresisted by a form of natural selection. We have seen that an attempt\r\nwas once made in Yorkshire to breed cattle with enormous buttocks, but\r\nthe cows perished so often in bringing forth their calves, that the\r\nattempt had to be given up. In rearing short-faced tumblers, Mr. Eaton\r\nsays,[5] “I am convinced that better head and beak birds have perished\r\nin the shell than ever were hatched; the reason being that the\r\namazingly short-faced bird cannot reach and break the shell with its\r\nbeak, and so perishes.” Here is a more curious case, in which natural\r\nselection comes into play only at long intervals of time: during\r\nordinary seasons the Niata cattle can graze as well as others, but\r\noccasionally, as from 1827 to 1830 the plains of La Plata suffer from\r\nlong-continued droughts and the pasture is burnt up; at such times\r\ncommon cattle and horses perish by the thousand, but many survive by\r\nbrowsing on twigs, reeds, etc.; this the Niata cattle cannot so well\r\neffect from their upturned jaws and the shape of their lips;\r\nconsequently, if not attended to, they perish before the other cattle.\r\nIn Columbia, according to Roulin, there is a breed of nearly hairless\r\ncattle, called Pelones; these succeed in their native hot district, but\r\nare found too tender for the Cordillera; in this case, however, natural\r\nselection determines only the range of the variety. It is obvious that\r\na host of artificial races could never survive in a state of\r\nnature;—such as Italian greyhounds,—hairless and almost toothless\r\nTurkish dogs,—fantail pigeons, which cannot fly well against a strong\r\nwind,—barbs and Polish fowls, with their vision impeded by their eye\r\nwattles and great topknots,—hornless bulls and rams, which consequently\r\ncannot cope with other males, and thus have a poor chance of leaving\r\noffspring,—seedless plants, and many other such cases.\r\n\r\nColour is generally esteemed by the systematic naturalist as\r\nunimportant: let us, therefore, see how far it indirectly affects our\r\ndomestic productions, and how far it would affect them if they were\r\nleft exposed to the full force of natural selection. In a future\r\nchapter I shall have to show that constitutional peculiarities of the\r\nstrangest kind, entailing liability to the action of certain poisons,\r\nare correlated with the colour of the skin. I will here give a single\r\ncase, on the high authority of Professor Wyman; he informs me that,\r\nbeing surprised at all the pigs in a part of Virginia being black, he\r\nmade inquiries, and ascertained that these animals feed on the roots of\r\nthe _Lachnanthes tinctoria,_ which colours their bones pink, and,\r\nexcepting in the case of the black varieties, causes the hoofs to drop\r\noff. Hence, as one of the squatters remarked, “we select the black\r\nmembers of the litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of\r\nliving.” So that here we have artificial and natural selection working\r\nhand in hand. I may add that in the Tarentino the inhabitants keep\r\nblack sheep alone, because the _Hypericum crispum_ abounds there; and\r\nthis plant does not injure black sheep, but kills the white ones in\r\nabout a fortnight’s time.[6]\r\n\r\nComplexion, and liability to certain diseases, are believed to run\r\ntogether in man and the lower animals. Thus white terriers suffer more\r\nthan those of any other colour from the fatal distemper.[7] In North\r\nAmerica plum-trees are liable to a disease which Downing[8] believes is\r\nnot caused by insects; the kinds bearing purple fruit are most\r\naffected, “and we have never known the green or yellow fruited\r\nvarieties infected until the other sorts had first become filled with\r\nthe knots.” On the other hand, peaches in North America suffer much\r\nfrom a disease called the _yellows,_ which seems to be peculiar to that\r\ncontinent, and more than nine-tenths of the victims, “when the disease\r\nfirst appeared, were the yellow-fleshed peaches. The white-fleshed\r\nkinds are much more rarely attacked; in some parts of the country\r\nnever.” In Mauritius, the white sugar-canes have of late years been so\r\nseverely attacked by a disease, that many planters have been compelled\r\nto give up growing this variety (although fresh plants were imported\r\nfrom China for trial), and cultivate only red canes.[9] Now, if these\r\nplants had been forced to struggle with other competing plants and\r\nenemies, there cannot be a doubt that the colour of the flesh or skin\r\nof the fruit, unimportant as these characters are considered, would\r\nhave rigorously determined their existence.\r\n\r\nLiability to the attacks of parasites is also connected with colour.\r\nWhite chickens are certainly more subject than dark-coloured chickens\r\nto the “gapes,” which is caused by a parasitic worm in the trachea.[10]\r\nOn the other hand, experience has shown that in France the caterpillars\r\nwhich produce white cocoons resist the deadly fungus better than those\r\nproducing yellow cocoons.[11] Analogous facts have been observed with\r\nplants: a new and beautiful white onion, imported from France, though\r\nplanted close to other kinds, was alone attacked by a parasitic\r\nfungus.[12] White verbenas are especially liable to mildew.[13] Near\r\nMalaga, during an early period of the vine-disease, the green sorts\r\nsuffered most; “and red and black grapes, even when interwoven with the\r\nsick plants, suffered not at all.” In France whole groups of varieties\r\nwere comparatively free, and others, such as the Chasselas, did not\r\nafford a single fortunate exception; but I do not know whether any\r\ncorrelation between colour and liability to disease was here\r\nobserved.[14] In a former chapter it was shown how curiously liable one\r\nvariety of the strawberry is to mildew.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that insects regulate in many cases the range and even\r\nthe existence of the higher animals, whilst living under their natural\r\nconditions. Under domestication light-coloured animals suffer most: in\r\nThuringia[15] the inhabitants do not like grey, white, or pale cattle,\r\nbecause they are much more troubled by various kinds of flies than the\r\nbrown, red, or black cattle. An Albino negro, it has been remarked,[16]\r\nwas peculiarly sensitive to the bites of insects. In the West\r\nIndies[17] it is said that “the only horned cattle fit for work are\r\nthose which have a good deal of black in them. The white are terribly\r\ntormented by the insects; and they are weak and sluggish in proportion\r\nto the white.”\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire there is a prejudice against white pigs, because it is\r\nbelieved that the sun blisters them when turned out;[18] and I knew a\r\nman who would not keep white pigs in Kent, for the same reason. The\r\nscorching of flowers by the sun seems likewise to depend much on\r\ncolour; thus, dark pelargoniums suffer most; and from various accounts\r\nit is clear that the cloth-of-gold variety will not withstand a degree\r\nof exposure to sunshine which other varieties enjoy. Another amateur\r\nasserts that not only all dark-coloured verbenas, but likewise\r\nscarlets, suffer from the sun: “the paler kinds stand better, and pale\r\nblue is perhaps the best of all.” So again with the heartsease (_Viola\r\ntricolor_); hot weather suits the blotched sorts, whilst it destroys\r\nthe beautiful markings of some other kinds.[19] During one extremely\r\ncold season in Holland all red-flowered hyacinths were observed to be\r\nvery inferior in quality. It is believed by many agriculturists that\r\nred wheat is hardier in northern climates than white wheat.[20]\r\n\r\nWith animals, white varieties from being conspicuous are the most\r\nliable to be attacked by beasts and birds of prey. In parts of France\r\nand Germany where hawks abound, persons are advised not to keep white\r\npigeons; for, as Parmentier says, “it is certain that in a flock the\r\nwhite always first fall victims to the kite.” In Belgium, where so many\r\nsocieties have been established for the flight of carrier-pigeons,\r\nwhite is the one colour which for the same reason is disliked.[21]\r\nProf. G. Jaeger[22] whilst fishing found four pigeons which had been\r\nkilled by hawks, and all were white; on another occasion he examined\r\nthe eyrie of a hawk, and the feathers of the pigeons which had been\r\ncaught were all of a white or yellow colour. On the other hand, it is\r\nsaid that the sea-eagle (_Falco ossifragus,_ Linn.) on the west coast\r\nof Ireland picks out the black fowls, so that “the villagers avoid as\r\nmuch as possible rearing birds of that colour.” M. Daudin,[23] speaking\r\nof white rabbits kept in warrens in Russia, remarks that their colour\r\nis a great disadvantage, as they are thus more exposed to attack, and\r\ncan be seen during bright nights from a distance. A gentleman in Kent,\r\nwho failed to stock his woods with a nearly white and hardy kind of\r\nrabbit, accounted in the same manner for their early disappearance. Any\r\none who will watch a white cat prowling after her prey will soon\r\nperceive under what a disadvantage she lies.\r\n\r\nThe white Tartarian cherry, “owing either to its colour being so much\r\nlike that of the leaves, or to the fruit always appearing from a\r\ndistance unripe,” is not so readily attacked by birds as other sorts.\r\nThe yellow-fruited raspberry, which generally comes nearly true by\r\nseed, “is very little molested by birds, who evidently are not fond of\r\nit; so that nets may be dispensed with in places where nothing else\r\nwill protect the red fruit.”[24] This immunity, though a benefit to the\r\ngardener, would be a disadvantage in a state of nature both to the\r\ncherry and raspberry, as dissemination depends on birds. I noticed\r\nduring several winters that some trees of the yellow-berried holly,\r\nwhich were raised from seed from a tree found wild by my father\r\nremained covered with fruit, whilst not a scarlet berry could be seen\r\non the adjoining trees of the common kind. A friend informs me that a\r\nmountain-ash (_Pyrus aucuparia_) growing in his garden bears berries\r\nwhich, though not differently coloured, are always devoured by birds\r\nbefore those on the other trees. This variety of the mountain-ash would\r\nthus be more freely disseminated, and the yellow-berried variety of the\r\nholly less freely, than the common varieties of these two trees.\r\n\r\nIndependently of colour, trifling differences are sometimes found to be\r\nof importance to plants under cultivation, and would be of paramount\r\nimportance if they had to fight their own battle and to struggle with\r\nmany competitors. The thin-shelled peas, called _pois sans parchemin,_\r\nare attacked by birds[25] much more commonly than ordinary peas. On the\r\nother hand, the purple-podded pea, which has a hard shell, escaped the\r\nattacks of tomtits (_Parus major_) in my garden far better than any\r\nother kind. The thin-shelled walnut likewise suffers greatly from the\r\ntomtit.[26] These same birds have been observed to pass over and thus\r\nfavour the filbert, destroying only the other kinds of nuts which grew\r\nin the same orchard.[27]\r\n\r\nCertain varieties of the pear have soft bark, and these suffer severely\r\nfrom wood-boring beetles; whilst other varieties are known to resist\r\ntheir attacks much better.[28] In North America the smoothness, or\r\nabsence of down on the fruit, makes a great difference in the attacks\r\nof the weevil, “which is the uncompromising foe of all smooth\r\nstone-fruits;” and the cultivator “has the frequent mortification of\r\nseeing nearly all, or indeed often the whole crop, fall from the trees\r\nwhen half or two-thirds grown.” Hence the nectarine suffers more than\r\nthe peach. A particular variety of the Morello cherry, raised in North\r\nAmerica, is, without any assignable cause, more liable to be injured by\r\nthis same insect than other cherry-trees.[29] From some unknown cause,\r\ncertain varieties of the apple enjoy, as we have seen, the great\r\nadvantage in various parts of the world of not being infested by the\r\ncoccus. On the other hand, a particular case has been recorded in which\r\naphides confined themselves to the Winter Nelis pear and touched no\r\nother kind in an extensive orchard.[30] The existence of minute glands\r\non the leaves of peaches, nectarines, and apricots, would not be\r\nesteemed by botanists as a character of the least importance for they\r\nare present or absent in closely-related sub-varieties, descended from\r\nthe same parent-tree; yet there is good evidence[31] that the absence\r\nof glands leads to mildew, which is highly injurious to these trees.\r\n\r\nA difference either in flavour or in the amount of nutriment in certain\r\nvarieties causes them to be more eagerly attacked by various enemies\r\nthan other varieties of the same species. Bullfinches (_Pyrrhula\r\nvulgaris_) injure our fruit-trees by devouring the flower-buds, and a\r\npair of these birds have been seen “to denude a large plum-tree in a\r\ncouple of days of almost every bud;” but certain varieties[32] of the\r\napple and thorn (_Cratægus oxyacantha_) are more especially liable to\r\nbe attacked. A striking instance of this was observed in Mr. Rivers’s\r\ngarden, in which two rows of a particular variety of plum[33] had to be\r\ncarefully protected, as they were usually stripped of all their buds\r\nduring the winter, whilst other sorts growing near them escaped. The\r\nroot (or enlarged stem) of Laing’s Swedish turnip is preferred by\r\nhares, and therefore suffers more than other varieties. Hares and\r\nrabbits eat down common rye before St. John’s-day-rye, when both grow\r\ntogether.[34] In the south of France, when an orchard of almond-trees\r\nis formed, the nuts of the bitter variety are sown, “in order that they\r\nmay not be devoured by field-mice”;[35] so we see the use of the bitter\r\nprinciple in almonds.\r\n\r\nOther slight differences, which would be thought quite unimportant, are\r\nno doubt sometimes of great service both to plants and animals. The\r\nWhitesmith’s gooseberry, as formerly stated, produces its leaves later\r\nthan other varieties, and, as the flowers are thus left unprotected,\r\nthe fruit often fails. In one variety of the cherry, according to Mr.\r\nRivers,[36] the petals are much curled backwards, and in consequence of\r\nthis the stigmas were observed to be killed by a severe frost; whilst\r\nat the same time, in another variety with incurved petals, the stigmas\r\nwere not in the least injured. The straw of the Fenton wheat is\r\nremarkably unequal in height; and a competent observer believes that\r\nthis variety is highly productive, partly because the ears from being\r\ndistributed at various heights above the ground are less crowded\r\ntogether. The same observer maintains that in the upright varieties the\r\ndivergent awns are serviceable by breaking the shocks when the ears are\r\ndashed together by the wind.[37] If several varieties of a plant are\r\ngrown together, and the seed is indiscriminately harvested, it is clear\r\nthat the hardier and more productive kinds will, by a sort of natural\r\nselection, gradually prevail over the others; this takes place, as\r\nColonel Le Couteur believes,[38] in our wheat-fields, for, as formerly\r\nshown, no variety is quite uniform in character. The same thing, as I\r\nam assured by nurserymen, would take place in our flower-gardens, if\r\nthe seed of the different varieties were not separately saved. When the\r\neggs of the wild and tame duck are hatched together, the young wild\r\nducks almost invariably perish, from being of smaller size and not\r\ngetting their fair share of food.[39]\r\n\r\nFacts in sufficient number have now been given showing that natural\r\nselection often checks, but occasionally favours, man’s power of\r\nselection. These facts teach us, in addition, a valuable lesson,\r\nnamely, that we ought to be extremely cautious in judging what\r\ncharacters are of importance in a state of nature to animals and\r\nplants, which have to struggle for existence from the hour of their\r\nbirth to that of their death,—their existence depending on conditions,\r\nabout which we are profoundly ignorant.\r\n\r\n      _Circumstances favourable to Selection by Man._\r\n\r\nThe possibility of selection rests on variability, and this, as we\r\nshall see in the following chapters, mainly depends on changed\r\nconditions of life, but is governed by infinitely complex and unknown\r\nlaws. Domestication, even when long continued, occasionally causes but\r\na small amount of variability, as in the case of the goose and turkey.\r\nThe slight differences, however, which characterise each individual\r\nanimal and plant would in most, probably in all, cases suffice for the\r\nproduction of distinct races through careful and prolonged selection.\r\nWe see what selection, though acting on mere individual differences,\r\ncan effect when families of cattle, sheep, pigeons, etc., of the same\r\nrace, have been separately bred during a number of years by different\r\nmen without any wish on their part to modify the breed. We see the same\r\nfact in the difference between hounds bred for hunting in different\r\ndistricts,[40] and in many other such cases.\r\n\r\nIn order that selection should produce any result, it is manifest that\r\nthe crossing of distinct races must be prevented; hence facility in\r\npairing, as with the pigeon, is highly favourable for the work; and\r\ndifficulty in pairing, as with cats, prevents the formation of distinct\r\nbreeds. On nearly the same principle the cattle of the small island of\r\nJersey have been improved in their milking qualities “with a rapidity\r\nthat could not have been obtained in a widely extended country like\r\nFrance.”[41] Although free crossing is a danger on the one side which\r\nevery one can see, too close interbreeding is a hidden danger on the\r\nother side. Unfavourable conditions of life overrule the power of\r\nselection. Our improved heavy breeds of cattle and sheep could not have\r\nbeen formed on mountainous pastures; nor could dray-horses have been\r\nraised on a barren and inhospitable land, such as the Falkland Islands,\r\nwhere even the light horses of La Plata rapidly decrease in size. It\r\nseems impossible to preserve several English breeds of sheep in France;\r\nfor as soon as the lambs are weaned their vigour decays as the heat of\r\nthe summer increases:[42] it would be impossible to give great length\r\nof wool to sheep within the tropics; yet selection has kept the Merino\r\nbreed nearly true under diversified and unfavourable conditions. The\r\npower of selection is so great, that breeds of the dog, sheep, and\r\npoultry, of the largest and smallest size, long and short beaked\r\npigeons, and other breeds with opposite characters, have had their\r\ncharacteristic qualities augmented, though treated in every way alike,\r\nbeing exposed to the same climate and fed on the same food. Selection,\r\nhowever, is either checked or favoured by the effects of use or habit.\r\nOur wonderfully-improved pigs could never have been formed if they had\r\nbeen forced to search for their own food; the English racehorse and\r\ngreyhound could not have been improved up to their present high\r\nstandard of excellence without constant training.\r\n\r\nAs conspicuous deviations of structure occur rarely, the improvement of\r\neach breed is generally the result of the selection of slight\r\nindividual differences. Hence the closest attention, the sharpest\r\npowers of observation, and indomitable perseverance, are indispensable.\r\nIt is, also, highly important that many individuals of the breed which\r\nis to be improved should be raised; for thus there will be a better\r\nchance of the appearance of variations in the right direction, and\r\nindividuals varying in an unfavourable manner may be freely rejected or\r\ndestroyed. But that a large number of individuals should be raised, it\r\nis necessary that the conditions of life should favour the propagation\r\nof the species. Had the peacock been reared as easily as the fowl, we\r\nshould probably ere this have had many distinct races. We see the\r\nimportance of a large number of plants, from the fact of nursery\r\ngardeners almost always beating amateurs in the exhibition of new\r\nvarieties. In 1845 it was estimated[43] that between 4000 and 5000\r\npelargoniums were annually raised from seed in England, yet a decidedly\r\nimproved variety is rarely obtained. At Messrs. Carter’s grounds, in\r\nEssex, where such flowers as the Lobelia, Nemophila, Mignonette, etc.,\r\nare grown by the acre for seed, “scarcely a season passes without some\r\nnew kinds being raised, or some improvement effected on old kinds.”[44]\r\nAt Kew, as Mr. Beaton remarks, where many seedlings of common plants\r\nare raised, “you see new forms of Laburnums, Spiraeas, and other\r\nshrubs.”[45] So with animals: Marshall,[46] in speaking of the sheep in\r\none part of Yorkshire, remarks, “as they belong to poor people, and are\r\nmostly in small lots, they never can be improved.” Lord Rivers, when\r\nasked how he succeeded in always having first-rate greyhounds,\r\nanswered, “I breed many, and hang many.” This, as another man remarks,\r\n“was the secret of his success; and the same will be found in\r\nexhibiting fowls,— successful competitors breed largely, and keep the\r\nbest.”[47]\r\n\r\nIt follows from this that the capacity of breeding at an early age and\r\nat short intervals, as with pigeons, rabbits, etc., facilitates\r\nselection; for the result is thus soon made visible, and perseverance\r\nin the work encouraged. It can hardly be an accident that the great\r\nmajority of the culinary and agricultural plants which have yielded\r\nnumerous races are annuals or biennials, which therefore are capable of\r\nrapid propagation, and thus of improvement. Sea-kale, asparagus, common\r\nand Jerusalem artichokes, potatoes, and onions, must be excepted, as\r\nthey are perennials: but onions are propagated like annuals, and of the\r\nother plants just specified, none, with the exception of the potato,\r\nhave yielded in this country more than one or two varieties. In the\r\nMediterranean region, where artichokes are often raised from seed,\r\nthere are several kinds, as I hear from Mr. Bentham. No doubt\r\nfruit-trees, which cannot be propagated quickly by seed, have yielded a\r\nhost of varieties, though not permanent races; but these, judging from\r\nprehistoric remains, have been produced at a comparatively late period.\r\n\r\nA species may be highly variable, but distinct races will not be\r\nformed, if from any cause selection be not applied. It would be\r\ndifficult to select slight variations in fishes from their place of\r\nhabitation; and though the carp is extremely variable and is much\r\nattended to in Germany, only one well-marked race has been formed, as I\r\nhear from Lord A. Russell, namely the _spiegel-carpe_; and this is\r\ncarefully secluded from the common scaly kind. On the other hand, a\r\nclosely allied species, the gold-fish, from being reared in small\r\nvessels, and from having been carefully attended to by the Chinese, has\r\nyielded many races. Neither the bee, which has been semi-domesticated\r\nfrom an extremely remote period, nor the cochineal insect, which was\r\ncultivated by the aboriginal Mexicans,[48] has yielded races; and it\r\nwould be impossible to match the queen-bee with any particular drone,\r\nand most difficult to match cochineal insects. Silk-moths, on the other\r\nhand, have been subjected to rigorous selection, and have produced a\r\nhost of races. Cats, which from their nocturnal habits cannot be\r\nselected for breeding, do not, as formerly remarked, yield distinct\r\nraces within the same country. Dogs are held in abomination in the\r\nEast, and their breeding is neglected; consequently, as Prof. Moritz\r\nWagner[49] remarks, one kind alone exists there. The ass in England\r\nvaries much in colour and size; but as it is an animal of little value\r\nand bred by poor people, there has been no selection, and distinct\r\nraces have not been formed. We must not attribute the inferiority of\r\nour asses to climate, for in India they are of even smaller size than\r\nin Europe. But when selection is brought to bear on the ass, all is\r\nchanged. Near Cordova, as I am informed (Feb. 1860) by Mr. W. E. Webb,\r\nC.E., they are carefully bred, as much as 200_l._ having been paid for\r\na stallion ass, and they have been immensely improved. In Kentucky,\r\nasses have been imported (for breeding mules) from Spain, Malta, and\r\nFrance; these “seldom averaged more than fourteen hands high: but the\r\nKentuckians, by great care, have raised them up to fifteen hands, and\r\nsometimes even to sixteen. The prices paid for these splendid animals,\r\nfor such they really are, will prove how much they are in request. One\r\nmale, of great celebrity, was sold for upwards of one thousand pounds\r\nsterling.” These choice asses are sent to cattle-shows, a day being\r\ngiven for their exhibition.[50]\r\n\r\nAnalogous facts have been observed with plants: the nutmeg-tree in the\r\nMalay archipelago is highly variable, but there has been no selection,\r\nand there are no distinct races.[51] The common mignonette (_Reseda\r\nodorata_), from bearing inconspicuous flowers, valued solely for their\r\nfragrance, “remains in the same unimproved condition as when first\r\nintroduced.”[52] Our common forest-trees are very variable, as may be\r\nseen in every extensive nursery-ground; but as they are not valued like\r\nfruit-trees, and as they seed late in life, no selection has been\r\napplied to them; consequently, as Mr. Patrick Matthews remarks,[53]\r\nthey have not yielded distinct races, leafing at different periods,\r\ngrowing to different sizes, and producing timber fit for different\r\npurposes. We have gained only some fanciful and semi-monstrous\r\nvarieties, which no doubt appeared suddenly as we now see them.\r\n\r\nSome botanists have argued that plants cannot have so strong a tendency\r\nto vary as is generally supposed, because many species long grown in\r\nbotanic gardens, or unintentionally cultivated year after year mingled\r\nwith our corn crops, have not produced distinct races; but this is\r\naccounted for by slight variations not having been selected and\r\npropagated. Let a plant which is now grown in a botanic garden, or any\r\ncommon weed, be cultivated on a large scale, and let a sharp-sighted\r\ngardener look out for each slight variety and sow the seed, and then,\r\nif distinct races are not produced, the argument will be valid.\r\n\r\nThe importance of selection is likewise shown by considering special\r\ncharacters. For instance, with most breeds of fowls the form of the\r\ncomb and the colour of the plumage have been attended to, and are\r\neminently characteristic of each race; but in Dorkings fashion has\r\nnever demanded uniformity of comb or colour; and the utmost diversity\r\nin these respects prevails. Rose-combs, double-combs, cup-combs, etc.,\r\nand colours of all kinds, may be seen in purely bred and closely\r\nrelated Dorking fowls, whilst other points, such as the general form of\r\nbody, and the presence of an additional toe, have been attended to, and\r\nare invariably present. It has also been ascertained that colour can be\r\nfixed in this breed, as well as in any other.[54]\r\n\r\nDuring the formation or improvement of a breed, its members will always\r\nbe found to vary much in those characters to which especial attention\r\nis directed, and of which each slight improvement is eagerly sought and\r\nselected. Thus, with short-faced tumbler-pigeons, the shortness of the\r\nbeak, shape of head and plumage,—with carriers, the length of the beak\r\nand wattle,—with fantails, the tail and carriage,—with Spanish fowls,\r\nthe white face and comb,—with long-eared rabbits, the length of ear,\r\nare all points which are eminently variable. So it is in every case;\r\nand the large price paid for first-rate animals proves the difficulty\r\nof breeding them up to the highest standard of excellence. This subject\r\nhas been discussed by fanciers,[55] and the greater prizes given for\r\nhighly improved breeds, in comparison with those given for old breeds\r\nwhich are not now undergoing rapid improvement, have been fully\r\njustified. Nathusius makes[56] a similar remark when discussing the\r\nless uniform character of improved Shorthorn cattle and of the English\r\nhorse, in comparison, for example, with the unennobled cattle of\r\nHungary, or with the horses of the Asiatic steppes. This want of\r\nuniformity in the parts which at the time are undergoing selection\r\nchiefly depends on the strength of the principle of reversion; but it\r\nlikewise depends to a certain extent on the continued variability of\r\nthe parts which have recently varied. That the same parts do continue\r\nvarying in the same manner we must admit, for if it were not so, there\r\ncould be no improvement beyond an early standard of excellence, and we\r\nknow that such improvement is not only possible, but is of general\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of continued variability, and more especially of\r\nreversion, all highly improved races, if neglected or not subjected to\r\nincessant selection, soon degenerate. Youatt gives a curious instance\r\nof this in some cattle formerly kept in Glamorganshire; but in this\r\ncase the cattle were not fed with sufficient care. Mr. Baker, in his\r\nmemoir on the Horse, sums up: “It must have been observed in the\r\npreceding pages that, whenever there has been neglect, the breed has\r\nproportionally deteriorated.”[57] If a considerable number of improved\r\ncattle, sheep, or other animals of the same race, were allowed to breed\r\nfreely together, with no selection, but with no change in their\r\ncondition of life, there can be no doubt that after a score or hundred\r\ngenerations they would be very far from excellent of their kind; but,\r\nfrom what we see of the many common races of dogs, cattle, fowls,\r\npigeons, etc., which without any particular care have long retained\r\nnearly the same character, we have no grounds for believing that they\r\nwould altogether depart from their type.\r\n\r\nIt is a general belief amongst breeders that characters of all kinds\r\nbecome fixed by long-continued inheritance. But I have attempted to\r\nshow in the fourteenth chapter that this belief apparently resolves\r\nitself into the following proposition, namely, that all characters\r\nwhatever, whether recently acquired or ancient, tend to be transmitted,\r\nbut that those which have already long withstood all counteracting\r\ninfluences, will, as a general rule, continue to withstand them, and\r\nconsequently be faithfully transmitted.\r\n\r\n      _Tendency in Man to carry the practice of Selection to an extreme\r\n      point._\r\n\r\nIt is an important principle that in the process of selection man\r\nalmost invariably wishes to go to an extreme point. Thus, there is no\r\nlimit to his desire to breed certain kinds of horses and dogs as fleet\r\nas possible, and others as strong as possible; certain kinds of sheep\r\nfor extreme fineness, and others for extreme length of wool; and he\r\nwishes to produce fruit, grain, tubers, and other useful parts of\r\nplants, as large and excellent as possible. With animals bred for\r\namusement, the same principle is even more powerful; for fashion, as we\r\nsee in our dress, always runs to extremes. This view has been expressly\r\nadmitted by fanciers. Instances were given in the chapters on the\r\npigeon, but here is another: Mr. Eaton, after describing a\r\ncomparatively new variety, namely, the Archangel, remarks, “What\r\nfanciers intend doing with this bird I am at a loss to know, whether\r\nthey intend to breed it down to the tumbler’s head and beak, or carry\r\nit out to the carrier’s head and beak; leaving it as they found it, is\r\nnot progressing.” Ferguson, speaking of fowls, says, “their\r\npeculiarities, whatever they may be, must necessarily be fully\r\ndeveloped: a little peculiarity forms nought but ugliness, seeing it\r\nviolates the existing laws of symmetry.” So Mr. Brent, in discussing\r\nthe merits of the sub-varieties of the Belgian canary-bird, remarks,\r\n“Fanciers always go to extremes; they do not admire indefinite\r\nproperties.”[58]\r\n\r\nThis principle, which necessarily leads to divergence of character,\r\nexplains the present state of various domestic races. We can thus see\r\nhow it is that racehorses and dray-horses, greyhounds and mastiffs,\r\nwhich are opposed to each other in every character,—how varieties so\r\ndistinct as Cochin-china fowls and bantams, or carrier-pigeons with\r\nvery long beaks, and tumblers with excessively short beaks, have been\r\nderived from the same stock. As each breed is slowly improved, the\r\ninferior varieties are first neglected and finally lost. In a few\r\ncases, by the aid of old records, or from intermediate varieties still\r\nexisting in countries where other fashions have prevailed, we are\r\nenabled partially to trace the graduated changes through which certain\r\nbreeds have passed. Selection, whether methodical or unconscious,\r\nalways tending towards an extreme point, together with the neglect and\r\nslow extinction of the intermediate and less-valued forms, is the key\r\nwhich unlocks the mystery of how man has produced such wonderful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances selection, guided by utility for a single purpose,\r\nhas led to convergence of character. All the improved and different\r\nraces of the pig, as Nathusius has well shown,[59] closely approach\r\neach other in character, in their shortened legs and muzzles, their\r\nalmost hairless, large, rounded bodies, and small tusks. We see some\r\ndegree of convergence in the similar outline of the body in well-bred\r\ncattle belonging to distinct races.[60] I know of no other such cases.\r\n\r\nContinued divergence of character depends on, and is indeed a clear\r\nproof, as previously remarked, of the same parts continuing to vary in\r\nthe same direction. The tendency to mere general variability or\r\nplasticity of organisation can certainly be inherited, even from one\r\nparent, as has been shown by Gärtner and Kölreuter, in the production\r\nof varying hybrids from two species, of which one alone was variable.\r\nIt is in itself probable that, when an organ has varied in any manner,\r\nit will again vary in the same manner, if the conditions which first\r\ncaused the being to vary remain, as far as can be judged, the same.\r\nThis is either tacitly or expressly admitted by all horticulturists: if\r\na gardener observes one or two additional petals in a flower, he feels\r\nconfident that in a few generations he will be able to raise a double\r\nflower, crowded with petals. Some of the seedlings from the weeping\r\nMoccas oak were so prostrate that they only crawled along the ground. A\r\nseedling from the fastigiate or upright Irish yew is described as\r\ndiffering greatly from the parent-form “by the exaggeration of the\r\nfastigiate habit of its branches.”[61] Mr. Shirreff, who has been\r\nhighly successful in raising new kinds of wheat, remarks, “A good\r\nvariety may safely be regarded as the forerunner of a better one.”[62]\r\nA great rose-grower, Mr. Rivers, has made the same remark with respect\r\nto roses. Sageret,[63] who had large experience, in speaking of the\r\nfuture progress of fruit-trees, observes that the most important\r\nprinciple is “that the more plants have departed from their original\r\ntype, the more they tend to depart from it.” There is apparently much\r\ntruth in this remark; for we can in no other way understand the\r\nsurprising amount of difference between varieties in the parts or\r\nqualities which are valued, whilst other parts retain nearly their\r\noriginal character.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing discussion naturally leads to the question, what is the\r\nlimit to the possible amount of variation in any part or quality, and,\r\nconsequently, is there any limit to what selection can effect? Will a\r\nracehorse ever be reared fleeter than Eclipse? Can our prize-cattle and\r\nsheep be still further improved? Will a gooseberry ever weigh more than\r\nthat produced by “London” in 1852? Will the beet-root in France yield a\r\ngreater percentage of sugar? Will future varieties of wheat and other\r\ngrain produce heavier crops than our present varieties? These questions\r\ncannot be positively answered; but it is certain that we ought to be\r\ncautious in answering them by a negative. In some lines of variation\r\nthe limit has probably been reached. Youatt believes that the reduction\r\nof bone in some of our sheep has already been carried so far that it\r\nentails great delicacy of constitution.[64] But seeing the great\r\nimprovement within recent times in our cattle and sheep, and especially\r\nin our pigs; seeing the wonderful increase in weight in our poultry of\r\nall kinds during the last few years; he would be a bold man who would\r\nassert that perfection has been reached. It has often been said that\r\nEclipse never was, and never will be, beaten in speed by any other\r\nhorse; but on making inquiries I find that the best judges believe that\r\nour present racehorses are fleeter.[65] The attempt to raise a new\r\nvariety of wheat more productive than the many old kinds, might have\r\nbeen thought until lately quite hopeless; but this has been effected by\r\nMajor Hallett, by careful selection. With respect to almost all our\r\nanimals and plants, those who are best qualified to judge do not\r\nbelieve that the extreme point of perfection has yet been reached even\r\nin the characters which have already been carried to a high standard.\r\nFor instance, the short-faced tumbler-pigeon has been greatly modified;\r\nnevertheless, according to Mr. Eaton[66] “the field is still as open\r\nfor fresh competitors as it was one hundred years ago.” Over and over\r\nagain it has been said that perfection had been attained with our\r\nflowers, but a higher standard has soon been reached. Hardly any fruit\r\nhas been more improved than the strawberry, yet a great authority\r\nremarks,[67] “it must not be concealed that we are far from the extreme\r\nlimits at which we may arrive.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt there is a limit beyond which the organisation cannot be\r\nmodified compatibly with health or life. The extreme degree of\r\nfleetness, for instance, of which a terrestrial animal is capable, may\r\nhave been acquired by our present racehorses; but as Mr. Wallace has\r\nwell remarked,[68] the question that interests us, “is not whether\r\nindefinite and unlimited change in any or all directions is possible,\r\nbut whether such differences as do occur in nature could have been\r\nproduced by the accumulation of varieties by selection.” And in the\r\ncase of our domestic productions, there can be no doubt that many parts\r\nof the organisation, to which man has attended, have been thus modified\r\nto a greater degree than the corresponding parts in the natural species\r\nof the same genera or even families. We see this in the form and size\r\nof our light and heavy dogs or horses,—in the beak and many other\r\ncharacters of our pigeons,—in the size and quality of many fruits,—in\r\ncomparison with the species belonging to the same natural groups.\r\n\r\nTime is an important element in the formation of our domestic races, as\r\nit permits innumerable individuals to be born, and these when exposed\r\nto diversified conditions are rendered variable. Methodical selection\r\nhas been occasionally practised from an ancient period to the present\r\nday, even by semi-civilised people, and during former times will have\r\nproduced some effect. Unconscious selection will have been still more\r\neffective; for during a lengthened period the more valuable individual\r\nanimals will occasionally have been saved, and the less valuable\r\nneglected. In the course of time, different varieties, especially in\r\nthe less civilised countries, will also have been more or less modified\r\nthrough natural selection. It is generally believed, though on this\r\nhead we have little or no evidence, that new characters in time become\r\nfixed; and after having long remained fixed it seems possible that\r\nunder new conditions they might again be rendered variable.\r\n\r\nHow great the lapse of time has been since man first domesticated\r\nanimals and cultivated plants, we begin dimly to see. When the\r\nlake-dwellings of Switzerland were inhabited during the Neolithic\r\nperiod, several animals were already domesticated and various plants\r\ncultivated. The science of language tells us that the art of ploughing\r\nand sowing the land was followed, and the chief animals had been\r\nalready domesticated, at an epoch so immensely remote, that the\r\nSanskrit, Greek, Latin, Gothic, Celtic, and Sclavonic languages had not\r\nas yet diverged from their common parent-tongue.[69]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to overrate the effects of selection\r\noccasionally carried on in various ways and places during thousands of\r\ngenerations. All that we know, and, in a still stronger degree, all\r\nthat we do not know,[70] of the history of the great majority of our\r\nbreeds, even of our more modern breeds, agrees with the view that their\r\nproduction, through the action of unconscious and methodical selection,\r\nhas been almost insensibly slow. When a man attends rather more closely\r\nthan is usual to the breeding of his animals, he is almost sure to\r\nimprove them to a slight extent. They are in consequence valued in his\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, and are bred by others; and their\r\ncharacteristic features, whatever these may be, will then slowly but\r\nsteadily be increased, sometimes by methodical and almost always by\r\nunconscious selection. At last a strain, deserving to be called a\r\nsub-variety, becomes a little more widely known, receives a local name,\r\nand spreads. The spreading will have been extremely slow during ancient\r\nand less civilised times, but now is rapid. By the time that the new\r\nbreed had assumed a somewhat distinct character, its history, hardly\r\nnoticed at the time, will have been completely forgotten; for, as Low\r\nremarks,[71] “we know how quickly the memory of such events is\r\neffaced.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as a new breed is thus formed, it is liable through the same\r\nprocess to break up into new strains and sub-varieties. For different\r\nvarieties are suited for, and are valued under, different\r\ncircumstances. Fashion changes, but, should a fashion last for even a\r\nmoderate length of time, so strong is the principle of inheritance,\r\nthat some effect will probably be impressed on the breed. Thus\r\nvarieties go on increasing in number, and history shows us how\r\nwonderfully they have increased since the earliest records.[72] As each\r\nnew variety is produced, the earlier, intermediate, and less valuable\r\nforms will be neglected, and perish. When a breed, from not being\r\nvalued, is kept in small numbers, its extinction almost inevitably\r\nfollows sooner or later, either from accidental causes of destruction\r\nor from close interbreeding; and this is an event which, in the case of\r\nwell-marked breeds, excites attention. The birth or production of a new\r\ndomestic race is so slow a process that it escapes notice; its death or\r\ndestruction is comparatively sudden, is often recorded, and when too\r\nlate sometimes regretted.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and\r\nnatural races. The latter are more uniform in character, possessing in\r\na high degree the appearance of natural species, and are of ancient\r\norigin. They are generally found in less civilised countries, and have\r\nprobably been largely modified by natural selection, and only to a\r\nsmall extent by man’s unconscious and methodical selection. They have,\r\nalso, during a long period, been directly acted on by the physical\r\nconditions of the countries which they inhabit. The so-called\r\nartificial races, on the other hand, are not so uniform in character;\r\nsome have a semi-monstrous character, such as “the wry-legged terriers\r\nso useful in rabbit-shooting,”[73] turnspit dogs, ancon sheep, niata\r\noxen, Polish fowls, fantail-pigeons, etc.; their characteristic\r\nfeatures have generally been acquired suddenly, though subsequently\r\nincreased by careful selections in many cases. Other races, which\r\ncertainly must be called artificial, for they have been largely\r\nmodified by methodical selection and by crossing, as the English\r\nracehorse, terrier-dogs, the English game-cock, Antwerp\r\ncarrier-pigeons, etc., nevertheless cannot be said to have an unnatural\r\nappearance; and no distinct line, as it seems to me, can be drawn\r\nbetween natural and artificial races.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that domestic races should generally present a\r\ndifferent aspect from natural species. Man selects and propagates\r\nmodifications solely for his own use or fancy, and not for the\r\ncreature’s own good. His attention is struck by strongly marked\r\nmodifications, which have appeared suddenly, due to some great\r\ndisturbing cause in the organisation. He attends almost exclusively to\r\nexternal characters; and when he succeeds in modifying internal\r\norgans,—when for instance he reduces the bones and offal, or loads the\r\nviscera with fat, or gives early maturity, etc.-the chances are strong\r\nthat he will at the same time weaken the constitution. On the other\r\nhand, when an animal has to struggle throughout its life with many\r\ncompetitors and enemies, under circumstances inconceivably complex and\r\nliable to change, modifications of the most varied nature in the\r\ninternal organs as well as in external characters, in the functions and\r\nmutual relations of parts, will be rigorously tested, preserved, or\r\nrejected. Natural selection often checks man’s comparatively feeble and\r\ncapricious attempts at improvement; and if it were not so, the result\r\nof his work, and of nature’s work, would be even still more different.\r\nNevertheless, we must not overrate the amount of difference between\r\nnatural species and domestic races; the most experienced naturalists\r\nhave often disputed whether the latter are descended from one or from\r\nseveral aboriginal stocks, and this clearly shows that there is no\r\npalpable difference between species and races.\r\n\r\nDomestic races propagate their kind far more truly, and endure for\r\nmunch longer periods, than most naturalists are willing to admit.\r\nBreeders feel no doubt on this head: ask a man who has long reared\r\nShorthorn or Hereford cattle, Leicester or Southdown sheep, Spanish or\r\nGame poultry, tumbler or carrier-pigeons, whether these races may not\r\nhave been derived from common progenitors, and he will probably laugh\r\nyou to scorn. The breeder admits that he may hope to produce sheep with\r\nfiner or longer wool and with better carcases, or handsomer fowls, or\r\ncarrier-pigeons with beaks just perceptibly longer to the practised\r\neye, and thus be successful at an exhibition. Thus far he will go, but\r\nno farther. He does not reflect on what follows from adding up during a\r\nlong course of time many slight, successive modifications; nor does he\r\nreflect on the former existence of numerous varieties, connecting the\r\nlinks in each divergent line of descent. He concludes, as was shown in\r\nthe earlier chapters, that all the chief breeds to which he has long\r\nattended are aboriginal productions. The systematic naturalist, on the\r\nother hand, who generally knows nothing of the art of breeding, who\r\ndoes not pretend to know how and when the several domestic races were\r\nformed, who cannot have seen the intermediate gradations, for they do\r\nnot now exist, nevertheless feels no doubt that these races are sprung\r\nfrom a single source. But ask him whether the closely allied natural\r\nspecies which he has studied may not have descended from a common\r\nprogenitor, and he in his turn will perhaps reject the notion with\r\nscorn. Thus the naturalist and breeder may mutually learn a useful\r\nlesson from each other.\r\n\r\n_Summary on Selection by Man._—There can be no doubt that methodical\r\nselection has effected and will effect wonderful results. It was\r\noccasionally practised in ancient times, and is still practised by\r\nsemi-civilised people. Characters of the highest importance, and others\r\nof trifling value, have been attended to, and modified. I need not here\r\nrepeat what has been so often said on the part which unconscious\r\nselection has played: we see its power in the difference between flocks\r\nwhich have been separately bred, and in the slow changes, as\r\ncircumstances have slowly changed, which many animals have undergone in\r\nthe same country, or when transported into a foreign land. We see the\r\ncombined effects of methodical and unconscious selection, in the great\r\namount of difference in those parts or qualities which are valued by\r\nman in comparison with the parts which are not valued, and consequently\r\nhave not been attended to. Natural selection often determines man’s\r\npower of selection. We sometimes err in imagining that characters,\r\nwhich are considered as unimportant by the systematic naturalist, could\r\nnot be affected by the struggle for existence, and could not be acted\r\non by natural selection; but striking cases have been given, showing\r\nhow great an error this is.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of selection coming into action rests on variability;\r\nand this is mainly caused, as we shall hereafter see, by changes in the\r\nconditions of life. Selection is sometimes rendered difficult, or even\r\nimpossible, by the conditions being opposed to the desired character or\r\nquality. It is sometimes checked by the lessened fertility and weakened\r\nconstitution which follow from long-continued close interbreeding. That\r\nmethodical selection may be successful, the closest attention and\r\ndiscernment, combined with unwearied patience, are absolutely\r\nnecessary; and these same qualities, though not indispensable, are\r\nhighly serviceable in the case of unconscious selection. It is almost\r\nnecessary that a large number of individuals should be reared; for thus\r\nthere will be a fair chance of variations of the desired nature\r\narising, and of every individual with the slightest blemish or in any\r\ndegree inferior being freely rejected. Hence length of time is an\r\nimportant element of success. Thus, also, reproduction at an early age\r\nand at short intervals favours the work. Facility in pairing animals,\r\nor their inhabiting a confined area, is advantageous as a check to free\r\ncrossing. Whenever and wherever selection is not practised, distinct\r\nraces are not formed within the same country. When any one part of the\r\nbody or one quality is not attended to, it remains either unchanged or\r\nvaries in a fluctuating manner, whilst at the same time other parts and\r\nother qualities may become permanently and greatly modified. But from\r\nthe tendency to reversion and to continued variability, those parts or\r\norgans which are now undergoing rapid improvement through selection,\r\nare likewise found to vary much. Consequently highly-bred animals when\r\nneglected soon degenerate; but we have no reason to believe that the\r\neffects of long-continued selection would, if the conditions of life\r\nremained the same, be soon and completely lost.\r\n\r\nMan always tends to go to an extreme point in the selection, whether\r\nmethodical or unconscious, of all useful and pleasing qualities. This\r\nis an important principle, as it leads to continued divergence, and in\r\nsome rare cases to convergence of character. The possibility of\r\ncontinued divergence rests on the tendency in each part or organ to go\r\non varying in the same manner in which it has already varied; and that\r\nthis occurs, is proved by the steady and gradual improvement of many\r\nanimals and plants during lengthened periods. The principle of\r\ndivergence of character, combined with the neglect and final extinction\r\nof all previous, less-valued, and intermediate varieties, explains the\r\namount of difference and the distinctness of our several races.\r\nAlthough we may have reached the utmost limit to which certain\r\ncharacters can be modified, yet we are far from having reached, as we\r\nhave good reason to believe, the limit in the majority of cases.\r\nFinally, from the difference between selection as carried on by man and\r\nby nature, we can understand how it is that domestic races often,\r\nthough by no means always, differ in general aspect from closely allied\r\nnatural species.\r\n\r\nThroughout this chapter and elsewhere I have spoken of selection as the\r\nparamount power, yet its action absolutely depends on what we in our\r\nignorance call spontaneous or accidental variability. Let an architect\r\nbe compelled to build an edifice with uncut stones, fallen from a\r\nprecipice. The shape of each fragment may be called accidental; yet the\r\nshape of each has been determined by the force of gravity, the nature\r\nof the rock, and the slope of the precipice,—events and circumstances,\r\nall of which depend on natural laws; but there is no relation between\r\nthese laws and the purpose for which each fragment is used by the\r\nbuilder. In the same manner the variations of each creature are\r\ndetermined by fixed and immutable laws; but these bear no relation to\r\nthe living structure which is slowly built up through the power of\r\nselection, whether this be natural or artificial selection.\r\n\r\nIf our architect succeeded in rearing a noble edifice, using the rough\r\nwedge-shaped fragments for the arches, the longer stones for the\r\nlintels, and so forth, we should admire his skill even in a higher\r\ndegree than if he had used stones shaped for the purpose. So it is with\r\nselection, whether applied by man or by nature; for although\r\nvariability is indispensably necessary, yet, when we look at some\r\nhighly complex and excellently adapted organism, variability sinks to a\r\nquite subordinate position in importance in comparison with selection,\r\nin the same manner as the shape of each fragment used by our supposed\r\narchitect is unimportant in comparison with his skill.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Quoted by Youatt on Sheep, p. 325. _See also_ Youatt on Cattle,\r\n pp. 62, 69.\r\n\r\n [2] MM.

CAUSES OF VARIABILITY.\r\n\r\nVARIABILITY DOES NOT NECESSARILY ACCOMPANY REPRODUCTION—CAUSES ASSIGNED\r\nBY VARIOUS AUTHORS—INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES—VARIABILITY OF EVERY KIND DUE\r\nTO CHANGED CONDITIONS OF LIFE—ON THE NATURE OF SUCH CHANGES—CLIMATE,\r\nFOOD, EXCESS OF NUTRIMENT—SLIGHT CHANGES SUFFICIENT—EFFECTS OF GRAFTING\r\nON THE VARIABILITY OF SEEDLING-TREES—DOMESTIC PRODUCTIONS BECOME\r\nHABITUATED TO CHANGED CONDITIONS—ON THE ACCUMULATIVE ACTION OF CHANGED\r\nCONDITIONS—CLOSE INTERBREEDING AND THE IMAGINATION OF THE MOTHER\r\nSUPPOSED TO CAUSE VARIABILITY—CROSSING AS A CAUSE OF THE APPEARANCE OF\r\nNEW CHARACTERS—VARIABILITY FROM THE COMMINGLING OF CHARACTERS AND FROM\r\nREVERSION—ON THE MANNER AND PERIOD OF ACTION OF THE CAUSES WHICH EITHER\r\nDIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, INDUCE\r\nVARIABILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now consider, as far as we can, the causes of the almost\r\nuniversal variability of our domesticated productions. The subject is\r\nan obscure one; but it may be useful to probe our ignorance. Some\r\nauthors, for instance Dr. Prosper Lucas, look at variability as a\r\nnecessary contingent on reproduction, and as much an aboriginal law as\r\ngrowth or inheritance. Others have of late encouraged, perhaps\r\nunintentionally, this view by speaking of inheritance and variability\r\nas equal and antagonistic principles. Pallas maintained, and he has had\r\nsome followers, that variability depends exclusively on the crossing of\r\nprimordially distinct forms. Other authors attribute variability to an\r\nexcess of food, and with animals to an excess relatively to the amount\r\nof exercise taken, or again to the effects of a more genial climate.\r\nThat these causes are all effective is highly probable. But we must, I\r\nthink, take a broader view, and conclude that organic beings, when\r\nsubjected during several generations to any change whatever in their\r\nconditions, tend to vary; the kind of variation which ensues depending\r\nin most cases in a far higher degree on the nature or constitution of\r\nthe being, than on the nature of the changed conditions.\r\n\r\nThose authors who believe that it is a law of nature that each\r\nindividual should differ in some slight degree from every other, may\r\nmaintain, apparently with truth, that this is the fact, not only with\r\nall domesticated animals and cultivated plants, but likewise with all\r\norganic beings in a state of nature. The Laplander by long practice\r\nknows and gives a name to each reindeer, though, as Linnæus remarks,\r\n“to distinguish one from another among such multitudes was beyond my\r\ncomprehension, for they were like ants on an anthill.” In Germany\r\nshepherds have won wagers by recognising each sheep in a flock of a\r\nhundred, which they had never seen until the previous fortnight. This\r\npower of discrimination, however, is as nothing compared to that which\r\nsome florists have acquired. Verlot mentions a gardener who could\r\ndistinguish 150 kinds of camellia, when not in flower; and it has been\r\npositively asserted that the famous old Dutch florist Voorhelm, who\r\nkept above 1200 varieties of the hyacinth, was hardly ever deceived in\r\nknowing each variety by the bulb alone. Hence we must conclude that the\r\nbulbs of the hyacinth and the branches and leaves of the camellia,\r\nthough appearing to an unpractised eye absolutely undistinguishable,\r\nyet really differ.[1]\r\n\r\nAs Linnæus has compared the reindeer in number to ants, I may add that\r\neach ant knows its fellow of the same community. Several times I\r\ncarried ants of the same species (_Formica rufa_) from one ant-hill to\r\nanother, inhabited apparently by tens of thousands of ants; but the\r\nstrangers were instantly detected and killed. I then put some ants\r\ntaken from a very large nest into a bottle strongly perfumed with\r\nassafœtida, and after an interval of twenty-four hours returned them to\r\ntheir home; they were at first threatened by their fellows, but were\r\nsoon recognised and allowed to pass. Hence each ant certainly\r\nrecognised, independently of odour, its fellow; and if all the ants of\r\nthe same community have not some countersign or watchword, they must\r\npresent to each other’s senses some distinguishable character.\r\n\r\nThe dissimilarity of brothers or sisters of the same family, and of\r\nseedlings from the same capsule, may be in part accounted for by the\r\nunequal blending of the characters of the two parents, and by the more\r\nor less complete recovery through reversion of ancestral characters on\r\neither side; but we thus only push the difficulty further back in time,\r\nfor what made the parents or their progenitors different? Hence the\r\nbelief[2] that an innate tendency to vary exists, independently of\r\nexternal differences, seems at first sight probable. But even the seeds\r\nnurtured in the same capsule are not subjected to absolutely uniform\r\nconditions, as they draw their nourishment from different points; and\r\nwe shall see in a future chapter that this difference sometimes\r\nsuffices to affect the character of the future plant. The greater\r\ndissimilarity of the successive children of the same family in\r\ncomparison with twins, which often resemble each other in external\r\nappearance, mental disposition, and constitution, in so extraordinary a\r\nmanner, apparently proves that the state of the parents at the exact\r\nperiod of conception, or the nature of the subsequent embryonic\r\ndevelopment, has a direct and powerful influence on the character of\r\nthe offspring. Nevertheless, when we reflect on the individual\r\ndifferences between organic beings in a state of nature, as shown by\r\nevery wild animal knowing its mate; and when we reflect on the infinite\r\ndiversity of the many varieties of our domesticated productions, we may\r\nwell be inclined to exclaim, though falsely as I believe, that\r\nVariability must be looked at as an ultimate fact, necessarily\r\ncontingent on reproduction.\r\n\r\nThose authors who adopt this latter view would probably deny that each\r\nseparate variation has its own proper exciting cause. Although we can\r\nseldom trace the precise relation between cause and effect, yet the\r\nconsiderations presently to be given lead to the conclusion that each\r\nmodification must have its own distinct cause, and is not the result of\r\nwhat we blindly call accident. The following striking case has been\r\ncommunicated to me by Dr. William Ogle. Two girls, born as twins, and\r\nin all respects extremely alike, had their little fingers on both hands\r\ncrooked; and in both children the second bicuspid tooth of the second\r\ndentition on the right side in the upper jaw was misplaced; for,\r\ninstead of standing in a line with the others, it grew from the roof of\r\nthe mouth behind the first bicuspid. Neither the parents nor any other\r\nmembers of the family were known to have exhibited any similar\r\npeculiarity; but a son of one of these girls had the same tooth\r\nsimilarly misplaced. Now, as both the girls were affected in exactly\r\nthe same manner, the idea of accident is at once excluded: and we are\r\ncompelled to admit that there must have existed some precise and\r\nsufficient cause which, if it had occurred a hundred times, would have\r\ngiven crooked fingers and misplaced bicuspid teeth to a hundred\r\nchildren. It is of course possible that this case may have been due to\r\nreversion to some long-forgotten progenitor, and this would much weaken\r\nthe value of the argument. I have been led to think of the probability\r\nof reversion, from having been told by Mr. Galton of another case of\r\ntwin girls born with their little fingers slightly crooked, which they\r\ninherited from their maternal grandmother.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the general arguments, which appear to me to have\r\ngreat weight, in favour of the view that variations of all kinds and\r\ndegrees are directly or indirectly caused by the conditions of life to\r\nwhich each being, and more especially its ancestors, have been exposed.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts that domesticated productions are more variable than\r\norganic beings which have never been removed from their natural\r\nconditions. Monstrosities graduate so insensibly into mere variations\r\nthat it is impossible to separate them; and all those who have studied\r\nmonstrosities believe that they are far commoner with domesticated than\r\nwith wild animals and plants;[3] and in the case of plants,\r\nmonstrosities would be equally noticeable in the natural as in the\r\ncultivated state. Under nature, the individuals of the same species are\r\nexposed to nearly uniform conditions, for they are rigorously kept to\r\ntheir proper places by a host of competing animals and plants; they\r\nhave, also, long been habituated to their conditions of life; but it\r\ncannot be said that they are subject to quite uniform conditions, and\r\nthey are liable to a certain amount of variation. The circumstances\r\nunder which our domestic productions are reared are widely different:\r\nthey are protected from competition; they have not only been removed\r\nfrom their natural conditions and often from their native land, but\r\nthey are frequently carried from district to district, where they are\r\ntreated differently, so that they rarely remain during any considerable\r\nlength of time exposed to closely similar conditions. In conformity\r\nwith this, all our domesticated productions, with the rarest\r\nexceptions, vary far more than natural species. The hive-bee, which\r\nfeeds itself and follows in most respects its natural habits of life,\r\nis the least variable of all domesticated animals, and probably the\r\ngoose is the next least variable; but even the goose varies more than\r\nalmost any wild bird, so that it cannot be affiliated with perfect\r\ncertainty to any natural species. Hardly a single plant can be named,\r\nwhich has long been cultivated and propagated by seed, that is not\r\nhighly variable; common rye (_Secale cereale_) has afforded fewer and\r\nless marked varieties than almost any other cultivated plant;[4] but it\r\nmay be doubted whether the variations of this, the least valuable of\r\nall our cereals, have been closely observed.\r\n\r\nBud-variation, which was fully discussed in a former chapter, shows us\r\nthat variability may be quite independent of seminal reproduction, and\r\nlikewise of reversion to long-lost ancestral characters. No one will\r\nmaintain that the sudden appearance of a moss-rose on a Provence-rose\r\nis a return to a former state, for mossiness of the calyx has been\r\nobserved in no natural species; the same argument is applicable to\r\nvariegated and laciniated leaves; nor can the appearance of nectarines\r\non peach-trees be accounted for on the principle of reversion. But\r\nbud-variations more immediately concern us, as they occur far more\r\nfrequently on plants which have been highly cultivated during a length\r\nof time, than on other and less highly cultivated plants; and very few\r\nwell-marked instances have been observed with plants growing under\r\nstrictly natural conditions. I have given one instance of an ash-tree\r\ngrowing in a gentleman’s pleasure-grounds; and occasionally there may\r\nbe seen, on beech and other trees, twigs leafing at a different period\r\nfrom the other branches. But our forest trees in England can hardly be\r\nconsidered as living under strictly natural conditions; the seedlings\r\nare raised and protected in nursery-grounds, and must often be\r\ntransplanted into places where wild trees of the kind would not\r\nnaturally grow. It would be esteemed a prodigy if a dog-rose growing in\r\na hedge produced by bud-variation a moss-rose, or a wild bullace or\r\nwild cherry-tree yielded a branch bearing fruit of a different shape\r\nand colour from the ordinary fruit. The prodigy would be enhanced if\r\nthese varying branches were found capable of propagation, not only by\r\ngrafts, but sometimes by seed; yet analogous cases have occurred with\r\nmany of our highly cultivated trees and herbs.\r\n\r\nThese several considerations alone render it probable that variability\r\nof every kind is directly or indirectly caused by changed conditions of\r\nlife. Or, to put the case under another point of view, if it were\r\npossible to expose all the individuals of a species during many\r\ngenerations to absolutely uniform conditions of life, there would be no\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\n      _On the Nature of the Changes in the Conditions of Life which\r\n      induce Variability._\r\n\r\nFrom a remote period to the present day, under climates and\r\ncircumstances as different as it is possible to conceive, organic\r\nbeings of all kinds, when domesticated or cultivated, have varied. We\r\nsee this with the many domestic races of quadrupeds and birds belonging\r\nto different orders, with goldfish and silkworms, with plants of many\r\nkinds, raised in various quarters of the world. In the deserts of\r\nnorthern Africa the date-palm has yielded thirty-eight varieties; in\r\nthe fertile plains of India it is notorious how many varieties of rice\r\nand of a host of other plants exist; in a single Polynesian island,\r\ntwenty-four varieties of the bread-fruit, the same number of the\r\nbanana, and twenty-two varieties of the arum, are cultivated by the\r\nnatives; the mulberry-tree in India and Europe has yielded many\r\nvarieties serving as food for the silkworm; and in China sixty-three\r\nvarieties of the bamboo are used for various domestic purposes.[5]\r\nThese facts, and innumerable others which could be added, indicate that\r\na change of almost any kind in the conditions of life suffices to cause\r\nvariability—different changes acting on different organisms.\r\n\r\nAndrew Knight[6] attributed the variation of both animals and plants to\r\na more abundant supply of nourishment, or to a more favourable climate,\r\nthan that natural to the species. A more genial climate, however, is\r\nfar from necessary; the kidney-bean, which is often injured by our\r\nspring frosts, and peaches, which require the protection of a wall,\r\nhave varied much in England, as has the orange-tree in northern Italy,\r\nwhere it is barely able to exist.[7] Nor can we overlook the fact,\r\nthough not immediately connected with our present subject, that the\r\nplants and shells of the Arctic regions are eminently variable.[8]\r\nMoreover, it does not appear that a change of climate, whether more or\r\nless genial, is one of the most potent causes of variability; for in\r\nregard to plants Alph. De Candolle, in his ‘Géographie Botanique’\r\nrepeatedly shows that the native country of a plant, where in most\r\ncases it has been longest cultivated, is that where it has yielded the\r\ngreatest number of varieties.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether a change in the nature of the food is a potent\r\ncause of variability. Scarcely any domesticated animal has varied more\r\nthan the pigeon or the fowl, but their food, especially that of\r\nhighly-bred pigeons, is generally the same. Nor can our cattle and\r\nsheep have been subjected to any great change in this respect. But in\r\nall these cases the food probably is much less varied in kind than that\r\nwhich was consumed by the species in its natural state.[9]\r\n\r\nOf all the causes which induce variability, excess of food, whether or\r\nnot changed in nature, is probably the most powerful. This view was\r\nheld with regard to plants by Andrew Knight, and is now held by\r\nSchleiden, more especially in reference to the inorganic elements of\r\nthe food.[10] In order to give a plant more food it suffices in most\r\ncases to grow it separately, and thus prevent other plants robbing its\r\nroots. It is surprising, as I have often seen, how vigorously our\r\ncommon wild species flourish when planted by themselves, though not in\r\nhighly manured land; separate growth is, in fact, the first step in\r\ncultivation. We see the converse of the belief that excess of food\r\ninduces variability in the following statement by a great raiser of\r\nseeds of all kinds:[11] “It is a rule invariably with us, when we\r\ndesire to keep a true stock of any one kind of seed, to grow it on poor\r\nland without dung; but when we grow for quantity, we act contrary, and\r\nsometimes have dearly to repent of it.” According also to Carrière, who\r\nhas had great experience with flower-garden seeds, “On remarque en\r\ngénéral les plantes de vigeur moyenne sont celles qui conservent le\r\nmieux leurs caractères.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of animals the want of a proper amount of exercise, as\r\nBechstein remarked, has perhaps played, independently of the direct\r\neffects of the disuse of any particular organ, an important part in\r\ncausing variability. We can see in a vague manner that, when the\r\norganised and nutrient fluids of the body are not used during growth,\r\nor by the wear and tear of the tissues, they will be in excess; and as\r\ngrowth, nutrition, and reproduction are intimately allied processes,\r\nthis superfluity might disturb the due and proper action of the\r\nreproductive organs, and consequently affect the character of the\r\nfuture offspring. But it may be argued that neither an excess of food\r\nnor a superfluity in the organised fluids of the body necessarily\r\ninduces variability. The goose and the turkey have been well fed for\r\nmany generations, yet have varied very little. Our fruit-trees and\r\nculinary plants, which are so variable, have been cultivated from an\r\nancient period, and, though they probably still receive more nutriment\r\nthan in their natural state, yet they must have received during many\r\ngenerations nearly the same amount; and it might be thought that they\r\nwould have become habituated to the excess. Nevertheless, on the whole,\r\nKnight’s view, that excess of food is one of the most potent causes of\r\nvariability, appears, as far as I can judge, probable.\r\n\r\nWhether or not our various cultivated plants have received nutriment in\r\nexcess, all have been exposed to changes of various kinds. Fruit-trees\r\nare grafted on different stocks, and grown in various soils. The seeds\r\nof culinary and agricultural plants are carried from place to place;\r\nand during the last century the rotation of our crops and the manures\r\nused have been greatly changed.\r\n\r\nSlight changes of treatment often suffice to induce variability. The\r\nsimple fact of almost all our cultivated plants and domesticated\r\nanimals having varied in all places and at all times, leads to this\r\nconclusion. Seeds taken from common English forest-trees, grown under\r\ntheir native climate, not highly manured or otherwise artificially\r\ntreated, yield seedlings which vary much, as may be seen in every\r\nextensive seed-bed. I have shown in a former chapter what a number of\r\nwell-marked and singular varieties the thorn (_Cratægus oxycantha_) has\r\nproduced: yet this tree has been subjected to hardly any cultivation.\r\nIn Staffordshire I carefully examined a large number of two British\r\nplants, namely _Geranium phæum_ and _pyrenaicum,_ which have never been\r\nhighly cultivated. These plants had spread spontaneously by seed from a\r\ncommon garden into an open plantation; and the seedlings varied in\r\nalmost every single character, both in their flower and foliage, to a\r\ndegree which I have never seen exceeded; yet they could not have been\r\nexposed to any great change in their conditions.\r\n\r\nWith respect to animals, Azara has remarked with much surprise[12]\r\nthat, whilst the feral horses on the Pampas are always of one of three\r\ncolours, and the cattle always of a uniform colour, yet these animals,\r\nwhen bred on the unenclosed estancias, though kept in a state which can\r\nhardly be called domesticated, and apparently exposed to almost\r\nidentically the same conditions as when they are feral, nevertheless\r\ndisplay a great diversity of colour. So again in India several species\r\nof fresh-water fish are only so far treated artificially, that they are\r\nreared in great tanks; but this small change is sufficient to induce\r\nmuch variability.[13]\r\n\r\nSome facts on the effects of grafting, in regard to the variability of\r\ntrees, deserve attention. Cabanis asserts that when certain pears are\r\ngrafted on the quince, their seeds yield a greater number of varieties\r\nthan do the seeds of the same variety of pear when grafted on the wild\r\npear.[14] But as the pear and quince are distinct species, though so\r\nclosely related that the one can be readily grafted and succeeds\r\nadmirably on the other, the fact of variability being thus caused is\r\nnot surprising; as we are here enabled to see the cause, namely, the\r\nvery different nature of the stock and graft. Several North American\r\nvarieties of the plum and peach are well known to reproduce themselves\r\ntruly by seed; but Downing asserts,[15] “that when a graft is taken\r\nfrom one of these trees and placed upon another stock, this grafted\r\ntree is found to lose its singular property of producing the same\r\nvariety by seed, and becomes like all other worked trees;”—that is, its\r\nseedlings become highly variable. Another case is worth giving: the\r\nLalande variety of the walnut-tree leafs between April 20th and May\r\n15th, and its seedlings invariably inherit the same habit; whilst\r\nseveral other varieties of the walnut leaf in June. Now, if seedlings\r\nare raised from the May-leafing Lalande variety, grafted on another\r\nMay-leafing variety, though both stock and graft have the same early\r\nhabit of leafing, yet the seedlings leaf at various times, even as late\r\nas the 5th of June.[16] Such facts as these are well fitted to show on\r\nwhat obscure and slight causes variability depends.\r\n\r\nI may here just allude to the appearance of new and valuable varieties\r\nof fruit-trees and of wheat in woods and waste places, which at first\r\nsight seems a most anomalous circumstance. In France a considerable\r\nnumber of the best pears have been discovered in woods; and this has\r\noccurred so frequently, that Poiteau asserts that “improved varieties\r\nof our cultivated fruits rarely originate with nurserymen.”[17] In\r\nEngland, on the other hand, no instance of a good pear having been\r\nfound wild has been recorded; and Mr. Rivers informs me that he knows\r\nof only one instance with apples, namely, the Bess Poole, which was\r\ndiscovered in a wood in Nottinghamshire. This difference between the\r\ntwo countries may be in part accounted for by the more favourable\r\nclimate of France, but chiefly from the great number of seedlings which\r\nspring up there in the woods. I infer that this is the case from a\r\nremark made by a French gardener,[18] who regards it as a national\r\ncalamity that such a number of pear-trees are periodically cut down for\r\nfirewood, before they have borne fruit. The new varieties which thus\r\nspring up in the woods, though they cannot have received any excess of\r\nnutriment, will have been exposed to abruptly changed conditions, but\r\nwhether this is the cause of their production is very doubtful. These\r\nvarieties, however, are probably all descended[19] from old cultivated\r\nkinds growing in adjoining orchards— a circumstance which will account\r\nfor their variability; and out of a vast number of varying trees there\r\nwill always be a good chance of the appearance of a valuable kind. In\r\nNorth America, where fruit-trees frequently spring up in waste places,\r\nthe Washington pear was found in a hedge, and the Emperor peach in a\r\nwood.[20]\r\n\r\nWith respect to wheat, some writers have spoken[21] as if it were an\r\nordinary event for new varieties to be found in waste places; the\r\nFenton wheat was certainly discovered growing on a pile of basaltic\r\ndetritus in a quarry, but in such a situation the plant would probably\r\nreceive a sufficient amount of nutriment. The Chidham wheat was raised\r\nfrom an ear found _on_ a hedge; and Hunter’s wheat was discovered _by_\r\nthe roadside in Scotland, but it is not said that this latter variety\r\ngrew where it was found.[22]\r\n\r\nWhether our domestic productions would ever become so completely\r\nhabituated to the conditions under which they now live, as to cease\r\nvarying, we have no sufficient means for judging. But, in fact, our\r\ndomestic productions are never exposed for a great length of time to\r\nuniform conditions, and it is certain that our most anciently\r\ncultivated plants, as well as animals, still go on varying, for all\r\nhave recently undergone marked improvement. In some few cases, however,\r\nplants have become habituated to new conditions. Thus, Metzger, who\r\ncultivated in Germany during many years numerous varieties of wheat,\r\nbrought from different countries,[23] states that some kinds were at\r\nfirst extremely variable, but gradually, in one instance after an\r\ninterval of twenty-five years, became constant; and it does not appear\r\nthat this resulted from the selection of the more constant forms.\r\n\r\n_On the Accumulative Action of changed Conditions of Life._—We have\r\ngood grounds for believing that the influence of changed conditions\r\naccumulates, so that no effect is produced on a species until it has\r\nbeen exposed during several generations to continued cultivation or\r\ndomestication. Universal experience shows us that when new flowers are\r\nfirst introduced into our gardens they do not vary; but ultimately all,\r\nwith the rarest exceptions, vary to a greater or less extent. In a few\r\ncases the requisite number of generations, as well as the successive\r\nsteps in the progress of variation, have been recorded, as in the often\r\nquoted instance of the Dahlia.[24] After several years’ culture the\r\nZinnia has only lately (1860) begun to vary in any great degree. “In\r\nthe first seven or eight years of high cultivation, the Swan River\r\ndaisy (_Brachycome iberidifolia_) kept to its original colour; it then\r\nvaried into lilac and purple and other minor shades.”[25] Analogous\r\nfacts have been recorded with the Scotch rose. In discussing the\r\nvariability of plants several experienced horticulturists have spoken\r\nto the same general effect. Mr. Salter[26] remarks, “Every one knows\r\nthat the chief difficulty is in breaking through the original form and\r\ncolour of the species, and every one will be on the look-out for any\r\nnatural sport, either from seed or branch; that being once obtained,\r\nhowever trifling the change may be, the result depends upon himself.”\r\nM. de Jonghe, who has had so much success in raising new varieties of\r\npears and strawberries,[27] remarks with respect to the former, “There\r\nis another principle, namely, that the more a type has entered into a\r\nstate of variation, the greater is its tendency to continue doing so;\r\nand the more it has varied from the original type, the more it is\r\ndisposed to vary still farther.” We have, indeed, already discussed\r\nthis latter point when treating of the power which man possesses,\r\nthrough selection, of continually augmenting in the same direction each\r\nmodification; for this power depends on continued variability of the\r\nsame general kind. The most celebrated horticulturist in France,\r\nnamely, Vilmorin,[28] even maintains that, when any particular\r\nvariation is desired, the first step is to get the plant to vary in any\r\nmanner whatever, and to go on selecting the most variable individuals,\r\neven though they vary in the wrong direction; for the fixed character\r\nof the species being once broken, the desired variation will sooner or\r\nlater appear.\r\n\r\nAs nearly all our animals were domesticated at an extremely remote\r\nepoch, we cannot, of course, say whether they varied quickly or slowly\r\nwhen first subjected to new conditions. But Dr. Bachman[29] states that\r\nhe has seen turkeys raised from the eggs of the wild species lose their\r\nmetallic tints and become spotted with white in the third generation.\r\nMr. Yarrell many years ago informed me that the wild ducks bred on the\r\nponds in St. James’s Park, which had never been crossed, as it is\r\nbelieved, with domestic ducks, lost their true plumage after a few\r\ngenerations. An excellent observer,[30] who has often reared ducks from\r\nthe eggs of the wild bird, and who took precautions that there should\r\nbe no crossing with domestic breeds, has given, as previously stated,\r\nfull details on the changes which they gradually undergo. He found that\r\nhe could not breed these wild ducks true for more than five or six\r\ngenerations, “as they then proved so much less beautiful. The white\r\ncollar round the neck of the mallard became much broader and more\r\nirregular, and white feathers appeared in the ducklings’ wings.” They\r\nincreased also in size of body; their legs became less fine, and they\r\nlost their elegant carriage. Fresh eggs were then procured from wild\r\nbirds; but again the same result followed. In these cases of the duck\r\nand turkey we see that animals, like plants, do not depart from their\r\nprimitive type until they have been subjected during several\r\ngenerations to domestication. On the other hand, Mr. Yarrell informed\r\nme that the Australian dingos, bred in the Zoological Gardens, almost\r\ninvariably produced in the first generation puppies marked with white\r\nand other colours; but, these introduced dingos had probably been\r\nprocured from the natives, who keep them in a semi-domesticated state.\r\nIt is certainly a remarkable fact that changed conditions should at\r\nfirst produce, as far as we can see, absolutely no effect; but that\r\nthey should subsequently cause the character of the species to change.\r\nIn the chapter on pangenesis I shall attempt to throw a little light on\r\nthis fact.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the causes which are supposed to induce variability.\r\nSome authors[31] believe that close interbreeding gives this tendency,\r\nand leads to the production of monstrosities. In the seventeenth\r\nchapter some few facts were advanced, showing that monstrosities are,\r\nas it appears, occasionally thus induced; and there can be no doubt\r\nthat close interbreeding causes lessened fertility and a weakened\r\nconstitution; hence it may lead to variability: but I have not\r\nsufficient evidence on this head. On the other hand, close\r\ninterbreeding, if not carried to an injurious extreme, far from causing\r\nvariability, tends to fix the character of each breed.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly a common belief, still held by some persons, that the\r\nimagination of the mother affects the child in the womb.[32] This view\r\nis evidently not applicable to the lower animals, which lay\r\nunimpregnated eggs, or to plants. Dr. William Hunter, in the last\r\ncentury, told my father that during many years every woman in a large\r\nLondon Lying-in Hospital was asked before her confinement whether\r\nanything had specially affected her mind, and the answer was written\r\ndown; and it so happened that in no one instance could a coincidence be\r\ndetected between the woman’s answer and any abnormal structure; but\r\nwhen she knew the nature of the structure, she frequently suggested\r\nsome fresh cause. The belief in the power of the mother’s imagination\r\nmay perhaps have arisen from the children of a second marriage\r\nresembling the previous father, as certainly sometimes occurs, in\r\naccordance with the facts given in the eleventh chapter.\r\n\r\n_Crossing as a Cause of Variability._—In an early part of this chapter\r\nit was stated that Pallas[33] and a few other naturalists maintain that\r\nvariability is wholly due to crossing. If this means that new\r\ncharacters never spontaneously appear in our domestic races, but that\r\nthey are all directly derived from certain aboriginal species, the\r\ndoctrine is little less than absurd; for it implies that animals like\r\nItalian greyhounds, pug-dogs, bull-dogs, pouter and fantail pigeons,\r\netc., were able to exist in a state of nature. But the doctrine may\r\nmean something widely different, namely, that the crossing of distinct\r\nspecies is the sole cause of the first appearance of new characters,\r\nand that without this aid man could not have formed his various breeds.\r\nAs, however, new characters have appeared in certain cases by\r\nbud-variation, we may conclude with certainty that crossing is not\r\nnecessary for variability. It is, moreover, certain that the breeds of\r\nvarious animals, such as of the rabbit, pigeon, duck, etc., and the\r\nvarieties of several plants, are the modified descendants of a single\r\nwild species. Nevertheless, it is probable that the crossing of two\r\nforms, when one or both have long been domesticated or cultivated, adds\r\nto the variability of the offspring, independently of the commingling\r\nof the characters derived from the two parent-forms; and this implies\r\nthat new characters actually arise. But we must not forget the facts\r\nadvanced in the thirteenth chapter, which clearly prove that the act of\r\ncrossing often leads to the reappearance or reversion of long-lost\r\ncharacters; and in most cases it would be impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween the reappearance of ancient characters and the first appearance\r\nof absolutely new characters. Practically, whether new or old, they\r\nwould be new to the breed in which they reappeared.\r\n\r\nGärtner declares,[34] and his experience is of the highest value on\r\nsuch a point, that, when he crossed native plants which had not been\r\ncultivated, he never once saw in the offspring any new character; but\r\nthat from the odd manner in which the characters derived from the\r\nparents were combined, they sometimes appeared as if new. When, on the\r\nother hand, he crossed cultivated plants, he admits that new characters\r\noccasionally appeared, but he is strongly inclined to attribute their\r\nappearance to ordinary variability, not in any way to the cross. An\r\nopposite conclusion, however, appears to me the more probable.\r\nAccording to Kölreuter, hybrids in the genus Mirabilis vary almost\r\ninfinitely, and he describes new and singular characters in the form of\r\nthe seeds, in the colour of the anthers, in the cotyledons being of\r\nimmense size, in new and highly peculiar odours, in the flowers\r\nexpanding early in the season, and in their closing at night. With\r\nrespect to one lot of these hybrids, he remarks that they presented\r\ncharacters exactly the reverse of what might have been expected from\r\ntheir parentage.[35]\r\n\r\nProf. Lecoq[36] speaks strongly to the same effect in regard to this\r\nsame genus, and asserts that many of the hybrids from _Mirabilis\r\njalapa_ and _multiflora_ might easily be mistaken for distinct species,\r\nand adds that they differed in a greater degree than the other species\r\nof the genus, from _M. jalapa._ Herbert, also, has described[37]\r\ncertain hybrid Rhododendrons as being “as _unlike all others_ in\r\nfoliage, as if they had been a separate species.” The common experience\r\nof floriculturists proves that the crossing and recrossing of distinct\r\nbut allied plants, such as the species of Petunia, Calceolaria,\r\nFuchsia, Verbena, etc., induces excessive variability; hence the\r\nappearance of quite new characters is probable. M. Carrière[38] has\r\nlately discussed this subject: he states that _Erythrina cristagalli_\r\nhad been multiplied by seed for many years, but had not yielded any\r\nvarieties: it was then crossed with the allied _E. herbacea,_ and “the\r\nresistance was now overcome, and varieties were produced with flowers\r\nof extremely different size, form, and colour.”\r\n\r\nFrom the general and apparently well-founded belief that the crossing\r\nof distinct species, besides commingling their characters, adds greatly\r\nto their variability, it has probably arisen that some botanists have\r\ngone so far as to maintain[39] that, when a genus includes only a\r\nsingle species, this when cultivated never varies. The proposition made\r\nso broadly cannot be admitted; but it is probably true that the\r\nvariability of monotypic genera when cultivated is generally less than\r\nthat of genera including numerous species, and this quite independently\r\nof the effects of crossing. I have shown in my ‘Origin of Species’ that\r\nthe species belonging to small genera generally yield a less number of\r\nvarieties in a state of nature than those belonging to large genera.\r\nHence the species of small genera would, it is probable, produce fewer\r\nvarieties under cultivation than the already variable species of larger\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have not at present sufficient evidence that the crossing\r\nof species, which have never been cultivated, leads to the appearance\r\nof new characters, this apparently does occur with species which have\r\nbeen already rendered in some degree variable through cultivation.\r\nHence crossing, like any other change in the conditions of life, seems\r\nto be an element, probably a potent one, in causing variability. But we\r\nseldom have the means of distinguishing, as previously remarked,\r\nbetween the appearance of really new characters and the reappearance of\r\nlong-lost characters, evoked through the act of crossing. I will give\r\nan instance of the difficulty in distinguishing such cases. The species\r\nof Datura may be divided into two sections, those having white flowers\r\nwith green stems, and those having purple flowers with brown stems: now\r\nNaudin[40] crossed _Datura lævis_ and _ ferox,_ both of which belong to\r\nthe white section, and raised from them 205 hybrids. Of these hybrids,\r\nevery one had brown stems and bore purple flowers; so that they\r\nresembled the species of the other section of the genus, and not their\r\nown two parents. Naudin was so much astonished at this fact, that he\r\nwas led carefully to observe both parent-species, and he discovered\r\nthat the pure seedlings of _D. ferox,_ immediately after germination,\r\nhad dark purple stems, extending from the young roots up to the\r\ncotyledons, and that this tint remained ever afterwards as a ring round\r\nthe base of the stem of the plant when old. Now I have shown in the\r\nthirteenth chapter that the retention or exaggeration of an early\r\ncharacter is so intimately related to reversion, that it evidently\r\ncomes under the same principle. Hence probably we ought to look at the\r\npurple flowers and brown stems of these hybrids, not as new characters\r\ndue to variability, but as a return to the former state of some ancient\r\nprogenitor.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the appearance of new characters from crossing, a few\r\nwords may be added to what has been said in former chapters on the\r\nunequal combination and transmission of the characters proper to the\r\ntwo parent-forms. When two species or races are crossed, the offspring\r\nof the first generation are generally uniform, but those subsequently\r\nproduced display an almost infinite diversity of character. He who\r\nwishes, says Kölreuter,[41] to obtain an endless number of varieties\r\nfrom hybrids should cross and recross them. There is also much\r\nvariability when hybrids or mongrels are reduced or absorbed by\r\nrepeated crosses with either pure parent-form: and a still higher\r\ndegree of variability when three distinct species, and most of all when\r\nfour species, are blended together by successive crosses. Beyond this\r\npoint Gärtner,[42] on whose authority the foregoing statements are\r\nmade, never succeeded in effecting a union; but Max Wichura[43] united\r\nsix distinct species of willows into a single hybrid. The sex of the\r\nparent species affects in an inexplicable manner the degree of\r\nvariability of hybrids; for Gärtner[44] repeatedly found that when a\r\nhybrid was used as a father and either one of the pure parent-species,\r\nor a third species, was used as the mother, the offspring were more\r\nvariable than when the same hybrid was used as the mother, and either\r\npure parent or the same third species as the father: thus seedlings\r\nfrom _Dianthus barbatus_ crossed by the hybrid _D. chinensi-barbatus_\r\nwere more variable than those raised from this latter hybrid fertilised\r\nby the pure _D. barbatus._ Max Wichura[45] insists strongly on an\r\nanalogous result with his hybrid willows. Again Gärtner[46] asserts\r\nthat the degree of variability sometimes differs in hybrids raised from\r\nreciprocal crosses between the same two species; and here the sole\r\ndifference is, that the one species is first used as the father and\r\nthen as the mother. On the whole we see that, independently of the\r\nappearance of new characters, the variability of successive crossed\r\ngenerations is extremely complex, partly from the offspring partaking\r\nunequally of the characters of the two parent-forms, and more\r\nespecially from their unequal tendency to revert to such characters or\r\nto those of more ancient progenitors.\r\n\r\n_On the Manner and on the Period of Action of the Causes which induce\r\nVariability._—This is an extremely obscure subject, and we need here\r\nonly consider, whether inherited variations are due to certain parts\r\nbeing acted on after they have been formed, or through the reproductive\r\nsystem being affected before their formation; and in the former case at\r\nwhat period of growth or development the effect is produced. We shall\r\nsee in the two following chapters that various agencies, such as an\r\nabundant supply of food, exposure to a different climate, increased use\r\nor disuse of parts, etc., prolonged during several generations,\r\ncertainly modify either the whole organisation or certain organs; and\r\nit is clear at least in the case of bud-variation that the action\r\ncannot have been through the reproductive system.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the part which the reproductive system takes in causing\r\nvariability, we have seen in the eighteenth chapter that even slight\r\nchanges in the conditions of life have a remarkable power in causing a\r\ngreater or less degree of sterility. Hence it seems not improbable that\r\nbeings generated through a system so easily affected should themselves\r\nbe affected, or should fail to inherit, or inherit in excess,\r\ncharacters proper to their parents. We know that certain groups of\r\norganic beings, but with exceptions in each group, have their\r\nreproductive systems much more easily affected by changed conditions\r\nthan other groups; for instance, carnivorous birds, more readily than\r\ncarnivorous mammals, and parrots more readily than pigeons; and this\r\nfact harmonises with the apparently capricious manner and degree in\r\nwhich various groups of animals and plants vary under domestication.\r\n\r\nKölreuter[47] was struck with the parallelism between the excessive\r\nvariability of hybrids when crossed and recrossed in various\r\nways,—these hybrids having their reproductive powers more or less\r\naffected,—and the variability of anciently cultivated plants. Max\r\nWichura[48] has gone one step farther, and shows that with many of our\r\nhighly cultivated plants, such as the hyacinth, tulip, auricula,\r\nsnapdragon, potato, cabbage, etc., which there is no reason to believe\r\nhave been hybridised, the anthers contain many irregular pollen-grains\r\nin the same state as in hybrids. He finds also in certain wild forms,\r\nthe same coincidence between the state of the pollen and a high degree\r\nof variability, as in many species of Rubus; but in R. caesius and\r\nidaeus, which are not highly variable species, the pollen is sound. It\r\nis also notorious that many cultivated plants, such as the banana,\r\npineapple, bread-fruit, and others previously mentioned, have their\r\nreproductive organs so seriously affected as to be generally quite\r\nsterile; and when they do yield seed, the seedlings, judging from the\r\nlarge number of cultivated races which exist, must be variable in an\r\nextreme degree. These facts indicate that there is some relation\r\nbetween the state of the reproductive organs and a tendency to\r\nvariability; but we must not conclude that the relation is strict.\r\nAlthough many of our highly cultivated plants may have their pollen in\r\na deteriorated condition, yet, as we have previously seen, they yield\r\nmore seeds, and our anciently domesticated animals are more prolific,\r\nthan the corresponding species in a state of nature. The peacock is\r\nalmost the only bird which is believed to be less fertile under\r\ndomestication than in its native state, and it has varied in a\r\nremarkably small degree. From these considerations it would seem that\r\nchanges in the conditions of life lead either to sterility or to\r\nvariability, or to both; and not that sterility induces variability. On\r\nthe whole it is probable that any cause affecting the organs of\r\nreproduction would likewise affect their product,—that is, the\r\noffspring thus generated.\r\n\r\nThe period of life at which the causes that induce variability act, is\r\nlikewise an obscure subject, which has been discussed by various\r\nauthors.[49] In some of the cases, to be given in the following\r\nchapter, of modifications from the direct action of changed conditions,\r\nwhich are inherited, there can be no doubt that the causes have acted\r\non the mature or nearly mature animal. On the other hand,\r\nmonstrosities, which cannot be distinctly separated from lesser\r\nvariations, are often caused by the embryo being injured whilst in the\r\nmother’s womb or in the egg. Thus I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire[50] asserts\r\nthat poor women who work hard during their pregnancy, and the mothers\r\nof illegitimate children troubled in their minds and forced to conceal\r\ntheir state, are far more liable to give birth to monsters than women\r\nin easy circumstances. The eggs of the fowl when placed upright or\r\notherwise treated unnaturally frequently produce monstrous chickens. It\r\nwould, however, appear that complex monstrosities are induced more\r\nfrequently during a rather late than during a very early period of\r\nembryonic life; but this may partly result from some one part, which\r\nhas been injured during an early period, affecting by its abnormal\r\ngrowth other parts subsequently developed; and this would be less\r\nlikely to occur with parts injured at a later period.[51] When any part\r\nor organ becomes monstrous through abortion, a rudiment is generally\r\nleft, and this likewise indicates that its development had already\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nInsects sometimes have their antennae or legs in a monstrous condition,\r\nthe larvae of which do not possess either antennae or legs; and in\r\nthese cases, as Quatrefages[52] believes, we are enabled to see the\r\nprecise period at which the normal progress of development was\r\ntroubled. But the nature of the food given to a caterpillar sometimes\r\naffects the colours of the moth, without the caterpillar itself being\r\naffected; therefore it seems possible that other characters in the\r\nmature insect might be indirectly modified through the larvae. There is\r\nno reason to suppose that organs which have been rendered monstrous\r\nhave always been acted on during their development; the cause may have\r\nacted on the organisation at a much earlier stage. It is even probable\r\nthat either the male or female sexual elements, or both, before their\r\nunion, may be affected in such a manner as to lead to modifications in\r\norgans developed at a late period of life; in nearly the same manner as\r\na child may inherit from his father a disease which does not appear\r\nuntil old age.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the facts above given, which prove that in many\r\ncases a close relation exists between variability and the sterility\r\nfollowing from changed conditions, we may conclude that the exciting\r\ncause often acts at the earliest possible period, namely, on the sexual\r\nelements, before impregnation has taken place. That an affection of the\r\nfemale sexual element may induce variability we may likewise infer as\r\nprobable from the occurrence of bud-variations; for a bud seems to be\r\nthe analogue of an ovule. But the male element is apparently much\r\noftener affected by changed conditions, at least in a visible manner,\r\nthan the female element or ovule and we know from Gärtner’s and\r\nWichura’s statements that a hybrid used as the father and crossed with\r\na pure species gives a greater degree of variability to the offspring,\r\nthan does the same hybrid when used as the mother. Lastly, it is\r\ncertain that variability may be transmitted through either sexual\r\nelement, whether or not originally excited in them, for Kölreuter and\r\nGärtner[53] found that when two species were crossed, if either one was\r\nvariable, the offspring were rendered variable.\r\n\r\n_Summary._—From the facts given in this chapter, we may conclude that\r\nthe variability of organic beings under domestication, although so\r\ngeneral, is not an inevitable contingent on life, but results from the\r\nconditions to which the parents have been exposed. Changes of any kind\r\nin the conditions of life, even extremely slight changes, often suffice\r\nto cause variability. Excess of nutriment is perhaps the most efficient\r\nsingle exciting cause. Animals and plants continue to be variable for\r\nan immense period after their first domestication; but the conditions\r\nto which they are exposed never long remain quite constant. In the\r\ncourse of time they can be habituated to certain changes, so as to\r\nbecome less variable; and it is possible that when first domesticated\r\nthey may have been even more variable than at present. There is good\r\nevidence that the power of changed conditions accumulates; so that two,\r\nthree, or more generations must be exposed to new conditions before any\r\neffect is visible. The crossing of distinct forms, which have already\r\nbecome variable, increases in the offspring the tendency to further\r\nvariability, by the unequal commingling of the characters of the two\r\nparents, by the reappearance of long-lost characters, and by the\r\nappearance of absolutely new characters. Some variations are induced by\r\nthe direct action of the surrounding conditions on the whole\r\norganisation, or on certain parts alone; other variations appear to be\r\ninduced indirectly through the reproductive system being affected, as\r\nwe know is often the case with various beings, which when removed from\r\ntheir natural conditions become sterile. The causes which induce\r\nvariability act on the mature organism, on the embryo, and, probably,\r\non the sexual elements before impregnation has been effected.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Des Jacinthes,’ etc., Amsterdam, 1768, p. 43; Verlot, ‘Des\r\n Variétés,’ etc., p. 86.

With\r\n respect to the similarity of twins in constitution, Dr. William Ogle\r\n has given me the following extract from Professor Trousseau’s Lectures\r\n (‘Clinique Médicale,’ tom. i.1 p. 523), in which a curious case is\r\n recorded:—“J’ai donné mes soins à deux frères jumeaux, tous deux si\r\n extraordinairement ressemblants qu’il m’était impossible de les\r\n reconnaitre, à moin de les voir l’un à côté de l’autre. Cette\r\n ressemblance physique s’étendait plus loin: ils avaient, permettez-moi\r\n l’expression, une similitude pathologique plus remarquable encore.\r\n Ainsi l’un d’eux que je voyais aux néothermes à Paris malade d’une\r\n ophthalmie rhumatismale me disait, ‘En ce moment mon frere doit avoir\r\n une ophthalmie comme la mienne;’ et comme je m’etais recrie, il me\r\n montrait quelques jours apres une lettre qu’il venait de recevoir de\r\n ce frère alors à Vienne, et qui lui écrivait en effet—‘J’ai mon\r\n ophthalmie, tu dois avoir la tienne.’ Quelque singulier que ceci\r\n puisse paraître, le fait n’en est pas moins exact: on ne me l’a pas\r\n raconté, je l’ai vu, et j’en ai vu d’autres analogues dans ma\r\n pratique. Ces deux jumeaux étaient aussi tous deux asthmatiques, et\r\n asthmatiques a un effroyable degré. Originaires de Marseille, ils\r\n n’ont jamais pu demeurer dans cette ville, ou leurs intérêts les\r\n appelaient souvent, sans etre pris de leurs acces; jamais ils n’en\r\n eprouvaient a Paris. Bien mieux, il leur suffisait de gagner Toulon\r\n pour être guéris de leurs attaques de Marseille. Voyageant sans cesse\r\n et dans tous pays pour leurs affaires, ils avaient remarque que\r\n certaines localités leur étaient funestes, que dans d’autres ils\r\n etaient exempts de tout phénomène d’oppression.”\r\n\r\n [3] Isid.

Many\r\nnaturalists, especially of the French school, attribute every\r\nmodification to the “monde ambiant,” that is, to changed climate, with\r\nall its diversities of heat and cold, dampness and dryness, light and\r\nelectricity, to the nature of the soil, and to varied kinds and amount\r\nof food. By the term definite action, as used in this chapter, I mean\r\nan action of such a nature that, when many individuals of the same\r\nvariety are exposed during several generations to any particular change\r\nin their conditions of life, all, or nearly all the individuals, are\r\nmodified in the same manner. The effects of habit, or of the increased\r\nuse and disuse of various organs, might have been included under this\r\nhead; but it will be convenient to discuss this subject in a separate\r\nchapter. By the term indefinite action I mean an action which causes\r\none individual to vary in one way and another individual in another\r\nway, as we often see with plants and animals after they have been\r\nsubjected for some generations to changed conditions of life. But we\r\nknow far too little of the causes and laws of variation to make a sound\r\nclassification. The action of changed conditions, whether leading to\r\ndefinite or indefinite results, is a totally distinct consideration\r\nfrom the effects of selection; for selection depends on the\r\npreservation by man of certain individuals, or on their survival under\r\nvarious and complex natural circumstances, and has no relation whatever\r\nto the primary cause of each particular variation.\r\n\r\nI will first give in detail all the facts which I have been able to\r\ncollect, rendering it probable that climate, food, etc., have acted so\r\ndefinitely and powerfully on the organisation of our domesticated\r\nproductions, that new sub-varieties or races have been thus formed\r\nwithout the aid of selection by man or nature. I will then give the\r\nfacts and considerations opposed to this conclusion, and finally we\r\nwill weigh, as fairly as we can, the evidence on both sides.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that distinct races of almost all our domesticated\r\nanimals exist in each kingdom of Europe, and formerly even in each\r\ndistrict of England, we are at first strongly inclined to attribute\r\ntheir origin to the definite action of the physical conditions of each\r\ncountry; and this has been the conclusion of many authors. But we\r\nshould bear in mind that man annually has to choose which animals shall\r\nbe preserved for breeding, and which shall be slaughtered. We have also\r\nseen that both methodical and unconscious selection were formerly\r\npractised, and are now occasionally practised by the most barbarous\r\nraces, to a much greater extent than might have been anticipated. Hence\r\nit is difficult to judge how far differences in the conditions between,\r\nfor instance, the several districts in England, have sufficed to modify\r\nthe breeds which have been reared in each. It may be argued that, as\r\nnumerous wild animals and plants have ranged during many ages\r\nthroughout Great Britain, and still retain the same character, the\r\ndifference in conditions between the several districts could not have\r\nmodified in a marked manner the various native races of cattle, sheep,\r\npigs, and horses. The same difficulty of distinguishing between the\r\neffects of natural selection and the definite action of external\r\nconditions is encountered in a still higher degree when we compare\r\nclosely allied species inhabiting two countries, such as North America\r\nand Europe, which do not differ greatly in climate, nature of soil,\r\netc., for in this case natural selection will inevitably and rigorously\r\nhave acted during a long succession of ages.\r\n\r\nProf. Weismann has suggested[1] that when a variable species enters a\r\nnew and isolated country, although the variations may be of the same\r\ngeneral nature as before, yet it is improbable that they should occur\r\nin the same proportional numbers. After a longer or shorter period, the\r\nspecies will tend to become nearly uniform in character from the\r\nincessant crossing of the varying individuals; but owing to the\r\nproportion of the individuals varying in different ways not being the\r\nsame in the two cases, the final result will be the production of two\r\nforms somewhat different from one another. In cases of this kind it\r\nwould falsely appear as if the conditions had induced certain definite\r\nmodifications, whereas they had only excited indefinite variability,\r\nbut with the variations in slightly different proportional numbers.\r\nThis view may throw some light on the fact that the domestic animals\r\nwhich formerly inhabited the several districts in Great Britain, and\r\nthe half wild cattle lately kept in several British parks, differed\r\nslightly from one another; for these animals were prevented from\r\nwandering over the whole country and intercrossing, but would have\r\ncrossed freely within each district or park.\r\n\r\nFrom the difficulty of judging how far changed conditions have caused\r\ndefinite modifications of structure, it will be advisable to give as\r\nlarge a body of facts as possible, showing that extremely slight\r\ndifferences within the same country, or during different seasons,\r\ncertainly produce an appreciable effect, at least on varieties which\r\nare already in an unstable condition. Ornamental flowers are good for\r\nthis purpose, as they are highly variable, and are carefully observed.\r\nAll floriculturists are unanimous that certain varieties are affected\r\nby very slight differences in the nature of the artificial compost in\r\nwhich they are grown, and by the natural soil of the district, as well\r\nas by the season. Thus, a skilful judge, in writing on Carnations and\r\nPicotees[2] asks “where can Admiral Curzon be seen possessing the\r\ncolour, size, and strength which it has in Derbyshire? Where can\r\nFlora’s Garland be found equal to those at Slough? Where do\r\nhigh-coloured flowers revel better than at Woolwich and Birmingham? Yet\r\nin no two of these districts do the same varieties attain an equal\r\ndegree of excellence, although each may be receiving the attention of\r\nthe most skilful cultivators.” The same writer then recommends every\r\ncultivator to keep five different kinds of soil and manure, “and to\r\nendeavour to suit the respective appetites of the plants you are\r\ndealing with, for without such attention all hope of general success\r\nwill be vain.” So it is with the Dahlia:[3] the Lady Cooper rarely\r\nsucceeds near London, but does admirably in other districts; the\r\nreverse holds good with other varieties; and again, there are others\r\nwhich succeed equally well in various situations. A skilful gardener[4]\r\nstates that he procured cuttings of an old and well-known variety\r\n(pulchella) of Verbena, which from having been propagated in a\r\ndifferent situation presented a slightly different shade of colour; the\r\ntwo varieties were afterwards multiplied by cuttings, being carefully\r\nkept distinct; but in the second year they could hardly be\r\ndistinguished, and in the third year no one could distinguish them.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the season has an especial influence on certain varieties\r\nof the Dahlia: in 1841 two varieties were pre-eminently good, and the\r\nnext year these same two were pre-eminently bad. A famous amateur[5]\r\nasserts that in 1861 many varieties of the Rose came so untrue in\r\ncharacter, “that it was hardly possible to recognise them, and the\r\nthought was not seldom entertained that the grower had lost his tally.”\r\nThe same amateur[6] states that in 1862 two-thirds of his Auriculas\r\nproduced central trusses of flowers, and such trusses are liable not to\r\nkeep true; and he adds that in some seasons certain varieties of this\r\nplant all prove good, and the next season all prove bad; whilst exactly\r\nthe reverse happens with other varieties. In 1845 the editor of the\r\n‘Gardener’s Chronicle’[7] remarked how singular it was that this year\r\nmany Calceolarias tended to assume a tubular form. With Heartsease[8]\r\nthe blotched sorts do not acquire their proper character until hot\r\nweather sets in; whilst other varieties lose their beautiful marks as\r\nsoon as this occurs.\r\n\r\nAnalogous facts have been observed with leaves: Mr. Beaton asserts[9]\r\nthat he raised at Shrubland, during six years, twenty thousand\r\nseedlings from the Punch Pelargonium, and not one had variegated\r\nleaves; but at Surbiton, in Surrey, one-third, or even a greater\r\nproportion, of the seedlings from this same variety were more or less\r\nvariegated. The soil of another district in Surrey has a strong\r\ntendency to cause variegation, as appears from information given me by\r\nSir F. Pollock. Verlot[10] states that the variegated strawberry\r\nretains its character as long as grown in a dryish soil, but soon loses\r\nit when planted in fresh and humid soil. Mr. Salter, who is well known\r\nfor his success in cultivating variegated plants, informs me that rows\r\nof strawberries were planted in his garden in 1859, in the usual way;\r\nand at various distances in one row, several plants simultaneously\r\nbecame variegated; and what made the case more extraordinary, all were\r\nvariegated in precisely the same manner. These plants were removed, but\r\nduring the three succeeding years other plants in the same row became\r\nvariegated, and in no instance were the plants in any adjoining row\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nThe chemical qualities, odours, and tissues of plants are often\r\nmodified by a change which seems to us slight. The Hemlock is said not\r\nto yield conicine in Scotland. The root of the _Aconitum napellus_\r\nbecomes innocuous in frigid climates. The medicinal properties of the\r\nDigitalis are easily affected by culture. As the _Pistacia lentiscus_\r\ngrows abundantly in the South of France, the climate must suit it, but\r\nit yields no mastic. The Laurus sassafras in Europe loses the odour\r\nproper to it in North America.[11] Many similar facts could be given,\r\nand they are remarkable because it might have been thought that\r\ndefinite chemical compounds would have been little liable to change\r\neither in quality or quantity.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the American Locust-tree (_Robinia_) when grown in England\r\nis nearly worthless, as is that of the Oak-tree when grown at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope.[12] Hemp and flax, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, flourish\r\nand yield plenty of seed on the plains of India, but their fibres are\r\nbrittle and useless. Hemp, on the other hand, fails to produce in\r\nEngland that resinous matter which is so largely used in India as an\r\nintoxicating drug.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Melon is greatly influenced by slight differences in\r\nculture and climate. Hence it is generally a better plan, according to\r\nNaudin, to improve an old kind than to introduce a new one into any\r\nlocality. The seed of the Persian Melon produces near Paris fruit\r\ninferior to the poorest market kinds, but at Bordeaux yields delicious\r\nfruit.[13] Seed is annually brought from Thibet to Kashmir[14] and\r\nproduces fruit weighing from four to ten pounds, but plants raised next\r\nyear from seed saved in Kashmir give fruit weighing only from two to\r\nthree pounds. It is well known that American varieties of the Apple\r\nproduce in their native land magnificent and brightly-coloured fruit,\r\nbut these in England are of poor quality and a dull colour. In Hungary\r\nthere are many varieties of the kidney-bean, remarkable for the beauty\r\nof their seeds, but the Rev. M.J. Berkeley[15] found that their beauty\r\ncould hardly ever be preserved in England, and in some cases the colour\r\nwas greatly changed. We have seen in the ninth chapter, with respect to\r\nwheat, what a remarkable effect transportal from the north to the south\r\nof France, and conversely, produced on the weight of the grain.\r\n\r\nWhen man can perceive no change in plants or animals which have been\r\nexposed to a new climate or to different treatment, insects can\r\nsometimes perceive a marked change. A cactus has been imported into\r\nIndia from Canton, Manilla Mauritius, and from the hot-houses of Kew,\r\nand there is likewise a so-called native kind which was formerly\r\nintroduced from South America; all these plants belong to the same\r\nspecies and are alike in appearance, but the cochineal insect\r\nflourishes only on the native kind, on which it thrives\r\nprodigiously.[16] Humboldt remarks[17] that white men “born in the\r\ntorrid zone walk barefoot with impunity in the same apartment where a\r\nEuropean, recently landed, is exposed to the attacks of the _Pulex\r\npenetrans._” This insect, the too well-known chigoe, must therefore be\r\nable to perceive what the most delicate chemical analysis fails to\r\ndiscover, namely, a difference between the blood or tissues of a\r\nEuropean and those of a white man born in the tropics. But the\r\ndiscernment of the chigoe is not so surprising as it at first appears;\r\nfor according to Liebig[18] the blood of men with different\r\ncomplexions, though inhabiting the same country, emits a different\r\nodour.\r\n\r\nDiseases peculiar to certain localities, heights, or climates, may be\r\nhere briefly noticed, as showing the influence of external\r\ncircumstances on the human body. Diseases confined to certain races of\r\nman do not concern us, for the constitution of the race may play the\r\nmore important part, and this may have been determined by unknown\r\ncauses. The Plica Polonica stands, in this respect, in a nearly\r\nintermediate position; for it rarely affects Germans, who inhabit the\r\nneighbourhood of the Vistula, where so many Poles are grievously\r\naffected; neither does it affect Russians, who are said to belong to\r\nthe same original stock as the Poles.[19] The elevation of a district\r\noften governs the appearance of diseases; in Mexico the yellow fever\r\ndoes not extend above 924 metres; and in Peru, people are affected with\r\nthe _verugas_ only between 600 and 1600 metres above the sea; many\r\nother such cases could be given. A peculiar cutaneous complaint, called\r\nthe _Bouton d’Alep,_ affects in Aleppo and some neighbouring districts\r\nalmost every native infant, and some few strangers; and it seems fairly\r\nwell established that this singular complaint depends on drinking\r\ncertain waters. In the healthy little island of St. Helena the\r\nscarlet-fever is dreaded like the Plague; analogous facts have been\r\nobserved in Chili and Mexico.[20] Even in the different departments of\r\nFrance it is found that the various infirmities which render the\r\nconscript unfit for serving in the army, prevail with remarkable\r\ninequality, revealing, as Boudin observes, that many of them are\r\nendemic, which otherwise would never have been suspected.[21] Any one\r\nwho will study the distribution of disease will be struck with surprise\r\nat what slight differences in the surrounding circumstances govern the\r\nnature and severity of the complaints by which man is at least\r\ntemporarily affected.\r\n\r\nThe modifications as yet referred to are extremely slight, and in most\r\ncases have been caused, as far as we can judge, by equally slight\r\ndifferences in the conditions. But such conditions acting during a\r\nseries of generations would perhaps produce a marked effect.\r\n\r\nWith plants, a considerable change of climate sometimes produces a\r\nconspicuous result. I have given in the ninth chapter the most\r\nremarkable case known to me, namely, that of varieties of maize, which\r\nwere greatly modified in the course of only two or three generations\r\nwhen taken from a tropical country to a cooler one, or conversely. Dr.\r\nFalconer informs me that he has seen the English Ribston-pippin apple,\r\na Himalayan oak, Prunus and Pyrus, all assume in the hotter parts of\r\nIndia a fastigiate or pyramidal habit; and this fact is the more\r\ninteresting, as a Chinese tropical species of Pyrus naturally grows\r\nthus. Although in these cases the changed manner of growth seems to\r\nhave been directly caused by the great heat, we know that many\r\nfastigiate trees have originated in their temperate homes. In the\r\nBotanic Gardens of Ceylon the apple-tree[22] “sends out numerous\r\nrunners under ground, which continually rise into small stems, and form\r\na growth around the parent-tree.” The varieties of the cabbage which\r\nproduce heads in Europe fail to do so in certain tropical\r\ncountries.[23] The _Rhododendron ciliatum_ produced at Kew flowers so\r\nmuch larger and paler-coloured than those which it bears on its native\r\nHimalayan mountain, that Dr. Hooker[24] would hardly have recognised\r\nthe species by the flowers alone. Many similar facts with respect to\r\nthe colour and size of flowers could be given.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Vilmorin and Buckman on carrots and parsnips prove\r\nthat abundant nutriment produces a definite and inheritable effect on\r\nthe roots, with scarcely any change in other parts of the plant. Alum\r\ndirectly influences the colour of the flowers of the Hydrangea.[25]\r\nDryness seems generally to favour the hairiness or villosity of plants.\r\nGärtner found that hybrid Verbascums became extremely woolly when grown\r\nin pots. Mr. Masters, on the other hand, states that the _Opuntia\r\nleucotricha_ “is well clothed with beautiful white hairs when grown in\r\na damp heat, but in a dry heat exhibits none of this peculiarity.”[26]\r\nSlight variations of many kinds, not worth specifying in detail, are\r\nretained only as long as plants are grown in certain soils, of which\r\nSageret[27] gives some instances from his own experience. Odart, who\r\ninsists strongly on the permanence of the varieties of the grape,\r\nadmits[28] that some varieties, when grown under a different climate or\r\ntreated differently, vary in a slight degree, as in the tint of the\r\nfruit and in the period of ripening. Some authors have denied that\r\ngrafting causes even the slightest difference in the scion; but there\r\nis sufficient evidence that the fruit is sometimes slightly affected in\r\nsize and flavour, the leaves in duration, and the flowers in\r\nappearance.[29]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, from the facts given in the first chapter, that\r\nEuropean dogs deteriorate in India, not only in their instincts but in\r\nstructure; but the changes which they undergo are of such a nature,\r\nthat they may be partly due to reversion to a primitive form, as in the\r\ncase of feral animals. In parts of India the turkey becomes reduced in\r\nsize, “with the pendulous appendage over the beak enormously\r\ndeveloped.”[30] We have seen how soon the wild duck, when domesticated,\r\nloses its true character, from the effects of abundant or changed food,\r\nor from taking little exercise. From the direct action of a humid\r\nclimate and poor pasture the horse rapidly decreases in size in the\r\nFalkland Islands. From information which I have received, this seems\r\nlikewise to be the case to a certain extent with sheep in Australia.\r\n\r\nClimate definitely influences the hairy covering of animals; in the\r\nWest Indies a great change is produced in the fleece of sheep, in about\r\nthree generations. Dr. Falconer states[31] that the Thibet mastiff and\r\ngoat, when brought down from the Himalaya to Kashmir, lose their fine\r\nwool. At Angora not only goats, but shepherd-dogs and cats, have fine\r\nfleecy hair, and Mr. Ainsworth[32] attributes the thickness of the\r\nfleece to the severe winters, and its silky lustre to the hot summers.\r\nBurnes states positively[33] that the Karakool sheep lose their\r\npeculiar black curled fleeces when removed into any other country. Even\r\nwithin the limits of England, I have been assured that the wool of two\r\nbreeds of sheep was slightly changed by the flocks being pastured in\r\ndifferent localities.[34] It has been asserted on good authority[35]\r\nthat horses kept during several years in the deep coal-mines of Belgium\r\nbecome covered with velvety hair, almost like that on the mole. These\r\ncases probably stand in close relation to the natural change of coat in\r\nwinter and summer. Naked varieties of several domestic animals have\r\noccasionally appeared; but there is no reason to believe that this is\r\nin any way related to the nature of the climate to which they have been\r\nexposed.[36]\r\n\r\nIt appears at first sight probable that the increased size, the\r\ntendency to fatten, the early maturity and altered forms of our\r\nimproved cattle, sheep, and pigs, have directly resulted from their\r\nabundant supply of food. This is the opinion of many competent judges,\r\nand probably is to a great extent true. But as far as form is\r\nconcerned, we must not overlook the more potent influence of lessened\r\nuse on the limbs and lungs. We see, moreover, as far as size is\r\nconcerned, that selection is apparently a more powerful agent than a\r\nlarge supply of food, for we can thus only account for the existence,\r\nas remarked to me by Mr. Blyth, of the largest and smallest breeds of\r\nsheep in the same country, of Cochin-China fowls and Bantams, of small\r\nTumbler and large Runt pigeons, all kept together and supplied with\r\nabundant nourishment. Nevertheless there can be little doubt that our\r\ndomesticated animals have been modified, independently of the increased\r\nor lessened use of parts, by the conditions to which they have been\r\nsubjected, without the aid of selection. For instance, Prof.\r\nRütimeyer[37] shows that the bones of domesticated quadrupeds can be\r\ndistinguished from those of wild animals by the state of their surface\r\nand general appearance. It is scarcely possible to read Nathusius’s\r\nexcellent ‘Vorstudien’[38] and doubt that, with the highly improved\r\nraces of the pig, abundant food has produced a conspicuous effect on\r\nthe general form of the body, on the breadth of the head and face, and\r\neven on the teeth. Nathusius rests much on the case of a purely bred\r\nBerkshire pig, which when two months old became diseased in its\r\ndigestive organs, and was preserved for observation until nineteen\r\nmonths old; at this age it had lost several characteristic features of\r\nthe breed, and had acquired a long, narrow head, of large size\r\nrelatively to its small body, and elongated legs. But in this case and\r\nin some others we ought not to assume that, because certain characters\r\nare lost, perhaps through reversion, under one course of treatment,\r\ntherefore that they were at first directly produced by an opposite\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the rabbit, which has become feral on the island of\r\nPorto Santo, we are at first strongly tempted to attribute the whole\r\nchange—the greatly reduced size, the altered tints of the fur, and the\r\nloss of certain characteristic marks—to the definite action of the new\r\nconditions to which it has been exposed. But in all such cases we have\r\nto consider in addition the tendency to reversion to progenitors more\r\nor less remote, and the natural selection of the finest shades of\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the food sometimes either definitely induces certain\r\npeculiarities, or stands in some close relation with them. Pallas long\r\nago asserted that the fat-tailed sheep of Siberia degenerate and lose\r\ntheir enormous tails when removed from certain saline pastures; and\r\nrecently Erman[39] states that this occurs with the Kirgisian sheep\r\nwhen brought to Orenburgh.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that hemp-seed causes bullfinches and certain other\r\nbirds to become black. Mr. Wallace has communicated to me some much\r\nmore remarkable facts of the same nature. The natives of the Amazonian\r\nregion feed the common green parrot (_Chrysotis festiva,_ Linn.) with\r\nthe fat of large Siluroid fishes, and the birds thus treated become\r\nbeautifully variegated with red and yellow feathers. In the Malayan\r\narchipelago, the natives of Gilolo alter in an analogous manner the\r\ncolours of another parrot, namely, the _Lorius garrulus,_ Linn., and\r\nthus produce the _Lori rajah_ or King-Lory. These parrots in the Malay\r\nIslands and South America, when fed by the natives on natural vegetable\r\nfood, such as rice and plaintains, retain their proper colours. Mr.\r\nWallace has, also, recorded[40] a still more singular fact. “The\r\nIndians (of S. America) have a curious art by which they change the\r\ncolours of the feathers of many birds. They pluck out those from the\r\npart they wish to paint, and inoculate the fresh wound with the milky\r\nsecretion from the skin of a small toad. The feathers grow of a\r\nbrilliant yellow colour, and on being plucked out, it is said, grow\r\nagain of the same colour without any fresh operation.”\r\n\r\nBechstein[41] does not entertain any doubt that seclusion from light\r\naffects, at least temporarily, the colours of cage-birds.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the shells of land-mollusca are affected by the\r\nabundance of lime in different districts. Isidore Geoffroy\r\nSaint-Hilaire[42] gives the case of _Helix lactea,_ which has recently\r\nbeen carried from Spain to the South of France and to the Rio Plata,\r\nand in both countries now presents a distinct appearance, but whether\r\nthis has resulted from food or climate is not known. With respect to\r\nthe common oyster, Mr. F. Buckland informs me that he can generally\r\ndistinguish the shells from different districts; young oysters brought\r\nfrom Wales and laid down in beds where “_natives_” are indigenous, in\r\nthe short space of two months begin to assume the “native” character.\r\nM. Costa[43] has recorded a much more remarkable case of the same\r\nnature, namely, that young shells taken from the shores of England and\r\nplaced in the Mediterranean, at once altered their manner of growth and\r\nformed prominent diverging rays, like those on the shells of the proper\r\nMediterranean oyster. The same individual shell, showing both forms of\r\ngrowth, was exhibited before a society in Paris. Lastly, it is well\r\nknown that caterpillars fed on different food sometimes either\r\nthemselves acquire a different colour or produce moths differing in\r\ncolour.[44]\r\n\r\nIt would be travelling beyond my proper limits here to discuss how far\r\norganic beings in a state of nature are definitely modified by changed\r\nconditions. In my ‘Origin of Species’ I have given a brief abstract of\r\nthe facts bearing on this point, and have shown the influence of light\r\non the colours of birds, and of residence near the sea on the lurid\r\ntints of insects, and on the succulency of plants. Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer[45] has recently discussed with much ability this whole subject\r\non general grounds. He argues, for instance, that with all animals the\r\nexternal and internal tissues are differently acted on by the\r\nsurrounding conditions, and they invariably differ in intimate\r\nstructure. So again the upper and lower surfaces of true leaves, as\r\nwell as of stems and petioles, when these assume the function and\r\noccupy the position of leaves, are differently circumstanced with\r\nrespect to light, etc., and apparently in consequence differ in\r\nstructure. But, as Mr. Herbert Spencer admits, it is most difficult in\r\nall such cases to distinguish between the effects of the definite\r\naction of physical conditions and the accumulation through natural\r\nselection of inherited variations which are serviceable to the\r\norganism, and which have arisen independently of the definite action of\r\nthese conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not here concerned with the definite action of the\r\nconditions of life on organisms in a state of nature, I may state that\r\nmuch evidence has been gained during the last few years on this\r\nsubject. In the United States, for instance, it has been clearly\r\nproved, more especially by Mr. J. A. Allen, that, with birds, many\r\nspecies differ in tint, size of body and of beak, and in length of\r\ntail, in proceeding from the North to the South; and it appears that\r\nthese differences must be attributed to the direct action of\r\ntemperature.[46] With respect to plants I will give a somewhat\r\nanalogous case: Mr. Meehan,[47] has compared twenty-nine kinds of\r\nAmerican trees with their nearest European allies, all grown in close\r\nproximity and under as nearly as possible the same conditions. In the\r\nAmerican species he finds, with the rarest exceptions, that the leaves\r\nfall earlier in the season, and assume before their fall a brighter\r\ntint; that they are less deeply toothed or serrated; that the buds are\r\nsmaller; that the trees are more diffuse in growth and have fewer\r\nbranchlets; and, lastly, that the seeds are smaller—all in comparison\r\nwith the corresponding European species. Now considering that these\r\ncorresponding trees belong to several distinct orders, and that they\r\nare adapted to widely different stations, it can hardly be supposed\r\nthat their differences are of any special service to them in the New\r\nand Old worlds; and if so such differences cannot have been gained\r\nthrough natural selection, and must be attributed to the long continued\r\naction of a different climate.\r\n\r\n_Galls._—Another class of facts, not relating to cultivated plants,\r\ndeserves attention. I allude to the production of galls. Every one\r\nknows the curious, bright-red, hairy productions on the wild rose-tree,\r\nand the various different galls produced by the oak. Some of the latter\r\nresemble fruit, with one face as rosy as the rosiest apple. These\r\nbright colours can be of no service either to the gall-forming insect\r\nor to the tree, and probably are the direct result of the action of the\r\nlight, in the same manner as the apples of Nova Scotia or Canada are\r\nbrighter coloured than English apples. According to Osten Sacken’s\r\nlatest revision, no less than fifty-eight kinds of galls are produced\r\non the several species of oak, by Cynips with its sub-genera; and Mr.\r\nB. D. Walsh[48] states that he can add many others to the list. One\r\nAmerican species of willow, the _Salix humilis,_ bears ten distinct\r\nkinds of galls. The leaves which spring from the galls of various\r\nEnglish willows differ completely in shape from the natural leaves. The\r\nyoung shoots of junipers and firs, when punctured by certain insects,\r\nyield monstrous growths resembling flowers and fir-cones; and the\r\nflowers of some plants become from the same cause wholly changed in\r\nappearance. Galls are produced in every quarter of the world; of\r\nseveral sent to me by Mr. Thwaites from Ceylon, some were as\r\nsymmetrical as a composite flower when in bud, others smooth and\r\nspherical like a berry; some protected by long spines, others clothed\r\nwith yellow wool formed of long cellular hairs, others with regularly\r\ntufted hairs. In some galls the internal structure is simple, but in\r\nothers it is highly complex; thus M. Lacaze-Duthiers[49] has figured in\r\nthe common ink-gall no less than seven concentric layers, composed of\r\ndistinct tissue, namely, the epidermic, sub-epidermic, spongy,\r\nintermediate, and the hard protective layer formed of curiously\r\nthickened woody cells, and, lastly, the central mass, abounding with\r\nstarch-granules on which the larvæ feed.\r\n\r\nGalls are produced by insects of various orders, but the greater number\r\nby species of Cynips. It is impossible to read M. Lacaze-Duthiers’\r\ndiscussion and doubt that the poisonous secretion of the insect causes\r\nthe growth of the gall; and every one knows how virulent is the poison\r\nsecreted by wasps and bees, which belong to the same group with Cynips.\r\nGalls grow with extraordinary rapidity, and it is said that they attain\r\ntheir full size in a few days;[50] it is certain that they are almost\r\ncompletely developed before the larvae are hatched. Considering that\r\nmany gall-insects are extremely small, the drop of secreted poison must\r\nbe excessively minute; it probably acts on one or two cells alone,\r\nwhich, being abnormally stimulated, rapidly increase by a process of\r\nself-division. Galls, as Mr. Walsh[51] remarks, afford good, constant,\r\nand definite characters, each kind keeping as true to form as does any\r\nindependent organic being. This fact becomes still more remarkable when\r\nwe hear that, for instance, seven out of the ten different kinds of\r\ngalls produced on _Salix humilis_ are formed by gall-gnats\r\n(_Cecidomyidæ_) which “though essentially distinct species, yet\r\nresemble one another so closely that in almost all cases it is\r\ndifficult, and in most cases impossible, to distinguish the full-grown\r\ninsects one from the other.”[52] For in accordance with a wide-spread\r\nanalogy we may safely infer that the poison secreted by insects so\r\nclosely allied would not differ much in nature; yet this slight\r\ndifference is sufficient to induce widely different results. In some\r\nfew cases the same species of gall-gnat produces on distinct species of\r\nwillows galls which cannot be distinguished; the _Cynips fecundatrix,_\r\nalso, has been known to produce on the Turkish oak, to which it is not\r\nproperly attached, exactly the same kind of gall as on the European\r\noak.[53] These latter facts apparently prove that the nature of the\r\npoison is a more powerful agent in determining the form of the gall\r\nthan the specific character of the tree which is acted on.\r\n\r\nAs the poisonous secretion of insects belonging to various orders has\r\nthe special power of affecting the growth of various plants; as a\r\nslight difference in the nature of the poison suffices to produce\r\nwidely different results; and lastly, as we know that the chemical\r\ncompounds secreted by plants are eminently liable to be modified by\r\nchanged conditions of life, we may believe it possible that various\r\nparts of a plant might be modified through the agency of its own\r\naltered secretions. Compare, for instance, the mossy and viscid calyx\r\nof a moss-rose, which suddenly appears through bud-variation on a\r\nProvence-rose, with the gall of red moss growing from the inoculated\r\nleaf of a wild rose, with each filament symmetrically branched like a\r\nmicroscopical spruce-fir, bearing a glandular tip and secreting\r\nodoriferous gummy matter.[54] Or compare, on the one hand, the fruit of\r\nthe peach, with its hairy skin, fleshy covering, hard shell and kernel,\r\nand on the other hand one of the more complex galls with its epidermic,\r\nspongy, and woody layers, surrounding tissue loaded with starch\r\ngranules. These normal and abnormal structures manifestly present a\r\ncertain degree of resemblance. Or, again, reflect on the cases above\r\ngiven of parrots which have had their plumage brightly decorated\r\nthrough some change in their blood, caused by having been fed on\r\ncertain fishes, or locally inoculated with the poison of a toad. I am\r\nfar from wishing to maintain that the moss-rose or the hard shell of\r\nthe peach-stone or the bright colours of birds are actually due to any\r\nchemical change in the sap or blood; but these cases of galls and of\r\nparrots are excellently adapted to show us how powerfully and\r\nsingularly external agencies may affect structure. With such facts\r\nbefore us, we need feel no surprise at the appearance of any\r\nmodification in any organic being.\r\n\r\nI may, also, here allude to the remarkable effects which parasitic\r\nfungi sometimes produce on plants. Reissek[55] has described a Thesium,\r\naffected by an Œcidium, which was greatly modified, and assumed some of\r\nthe characteristic features of certain allied species, or even genera.\r\nSuppose, says Reissek, “the condition originally caused by the fungus\r\nto become constant in the course of time, the plant would, if found\r\ngrowing wild, be considered as a distinct species or even as belonging\r\nto a new genus.” I quote this remark to show how profoundly, yet in how\r\nnatural a manner, this plant must have been modified by the parasitic\r\nfungus. Mr. Meehan[56] also states that three species of Euphorbia and\r\n_Portulaca olereacea,_ which naturally grow prostrate, become erect\r\nwhen they are attacked by the Œcidium. _Euphorbia maculata_ in this\r\ncase also becomes nodose, with the branchlets comparatively smooth and\r\nthe leaves modified in shape, approaching in these respects to a\r\ndistinct species, namely, the _E. hypericifolia._\r\n\r\n      _Facts and Considerations opposed to the belief that the\r\n      Conditions of Life act in a potent manner in causing definite\r\n      Modifications of Structure_\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the slight differences in species naturally living in\r\ndistinct countries under different conditions; and such differences we\r\nfeel at first inclined to attribute, probably often with justice, to\r\nthe definite action of the surrounding conditions. But it must be borne\r\nin mind that there exist many animals and plants which range widely and\r\nhave been exposed to great diversities of climate, yet remain uniform\r\nin character. Some authors, as previously remarked, account for the\r\nvarieties of our culinary and agricultural plants by the definite\r\naction of the conditions to which they have been exposed in the\r\ndifferent parts of Great Britain; but there are about 200 plants[57]\r\nwhich are found in every single English county; and these plants must\r\nhave been exposed for an immense period to considerable differences of\r\nclimate and soil, yet do not differ. So, again, some animals and plants\r\nrange over a large portion of the world, yet retain the same character.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the facts previously given on the occurrence of highly\r\npeculiar local diseases and on the strange modifications of structure\r\nin plants caused by the inoculated poison of insects, and other\r\nanalogous cases; still there are a multitude of variations—such as the\r\nmodified skull of the niata ox and bulldog, the long horns of Caffre\r\ncattle, the conjoined toes of the solid-hoofed swine, the immense crest\r\nand protuberant skull of Polish fowls, the crop of the pouter-pigeon,\r\nand a host of other such cases—which we can hardly attribute to the\r\ndefinite action, in the sense before specified, of the external\r\nconditions of life. No doubt in every case there must have been some\r\nexciting cause; but as we see innumerable individuals exposed to nearly\r\nthe same conditions, and one alone is affected, we may conclude that\r\nthe constitution of the individual is of far higher importance than the\r\nconditions to which it has been exposed. It seems, indeed, to be a\r\ngeneral rule that conspicuous variations occur rarely, and in one\r\nindividual alone out of millions, though all may have been exposed, as\r\nfar as we can judge, to nearly the same conditions. As the most\r\nstrongly marked variations graduate insensibly into the most trifling,\r\nwe are led by the same train of thought to attribute each slight\r\nvariation much more to innate differences of constitution, however\r\ncaused, than to the definite action of the surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nWe are led to the same conclusion by considering the cases, formerly\r\nalluded to, of fowls and pigeons, which have varied and will no doubt\r\ngo on varying in directly opposite ways, though kept during many\r\ngenerations under nearly the same conditions. Some, for instance, are\r\nborn with their beaks, wings, tails, legs, etc., a little longer, and\r\nothers with these same parts a little shorter. By the long-continued\r\nselection of such slight individual differences which occur in birds\r\nkept in the same aviary, widely different races could certainly be\r\nformed; and long-continued selection, important as is the result, does\r\nnothing but preserve the variations which arise, as it appears to us,\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\nIn these cases we see that domesticated animals vary in an indefinite\r\nnumber of particulars, though treated as uniformly as is possible. On\r\nthe other hand, there are instances of animals and plants, which,\r\nthough they have been exposed to very different conditions, both under\r\nnature and domestication, have varied in nearly the same manner. Mr.\r\nLayard informs me that he has observed amongst the Caffres of South\r\nAfrica a dog singularly like an arctic Esquimaux dog. Pigeons in India\r\npresent nearly the same wide diversities of colour as in Europe; and I\r\nhave seen chequered and simply barred pigeons, and pigeons with blue\r\nand white loins, from Sierra Leone, Madeira, England, and India. New\r\nvarieties of flowers are continually raised in different parts of Great\r\nBritain, but many of these are found by the judges at our exhibitions\r\nto be almost identical with old varieties. A vast number of new\r\nfruit-trees and culinary vegetables have been produced in North\r\nAmerica: these differ from European varieties in the same general\r\nmanner as the several varieties raised in Europe differ from one\r\nanother; and no one has ever pretended that the climate of America has\r\ngiven to the many American varieties any general character by which\r\nthey can be recognised. Nevertheless, from the facts previously\r\nadvanced on the authority of Mr. Meehan with respect to American and\r\nEuropean forest-trees it would be rash to affirm that varieties raised\r\nin the two countries would not in the course of ages assume a\r\ndistinctive character. Dr. M. Masters has recorded a striking fact[58]\r\nbearing on this subject: he raised numerous plants of _Hybiscus\r\nsyriacus_ from seed collected in South Carolina and the Holy Land,\r\nwhere the parent-plants must have been exposed to considerably\r\ndifferent conditions; yet the seedlings from both localities broke into\r\ntwo similar strains, one with obtuse leaves and purple or crimson\r\nflowers, and the other with elongated leaves and more or less pink\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nWe may, also, infer the prepotent influence of the constitution of the\r\norganism over the definite action of the conditions of life, from the\r\nseveral cases given in the earlier chapters of parallel series of\r\nvarieties,—an important subject, hereafter to be more fully discussed.\r\nSub-varieties of the several kinds of wheat, gourds, peaches, and other\r\nplants, and to a limited extent sub-varieties of the fowl, pigeon, and\r\ndog, have been shown either to resemble or to differ from one another\r\nin a closely corresponding or parallel manner. In other cases, a\r\nvariety of one species resembles a distinct species; or the varieties\r\nof two distinct species resemble one another. Although these parallel\r\nresemblances no doubt often result from reversion to the former\r\ncharacters of a common progenitor; yet in other cases, when new\r\ncharacters first appear, the resemblance must be attributed to the\r\ninheritance of a similar constitution, and consequently to a tendency\r\nto vary in the same manner. We see something of a similar kind in the\r\nsame monstrosity appearing and reappearing many times in the same\r\nspecies of animal, and, as Dr. Maxwell Masters has remarked to me, in\r\nthe same species of plant.\r\n\r\nWe may at least conclude, that the amount of modification which animals\r\nand plants have undergone under domestication does not correspond with\r\nthe degree to which they have been subjected to changed circumstances.\r\nAs we know the parentage of domesticated birds far better than of most\r\nquadrupeds, we will glance through the list. The pigeon has varied in\r\nEurope more than almost any other bird; yet it is a native species, and\r\nhas not been exposed to any extraordinary change of conditions. The\r\nfowl has varied equally, or almost equally, with the pigeon, and is a\r\nnative of the hot jungles of India. Neither the peacock, a native of\r\nthe same country, nor the guinea-fowl, an inhabitant of the dry deserts\r\nof Africa, has varied at all, or only in colour. The turkey, from\r\nMexico, has varied but little. The duck, on the other hand, a native of\r\nEurope, has yielded some well-marked races; and as this is an aquatic\r\nbird, it must have been subjected to a far more serious change in its\r\nhabits than the pigeon or even the fowl, which nevertheless have varied\r\nin a much higher degree. The goose, a native of Europe and aquatic like\r\nthe duck, has varied less than any other domesticated bird, except the\r\npeacock.\r\n\r\nBud-variation is, also, important under our present point of view, in\r\nsome few cases, as when all the eyes on the same tuber of the potato,\r\nor all the fruit on the same plum-tree, or all the flowers on the same\r\nplant, have suddenly varied in the same manner, it might be argued that\r\nthe variation had been definitely caused by some change in the\r\nconditions to which the plants had been exposed; yet, in other cases,\r\nsuch an admission is extremely difficult. As new characters sometimes\r\nappear by bud-variation, which do not occur in the parent-species or in\r\nany allied species, we may reject, at least in these cases, the idea\r\nthat they are due to reversion. Now it is well worth while to reflect\r\nmaturely on some striking case of bud-variation, for instance that of\r\nthe peach. This tree has been cultivated by the million in various\r\nparts of the world, has been treated differently, grown on its own\r\nroots and grafted on various stocks, planted as a standard, trained\r\nagainst a wall, or under glass; yet each bud of each sub-variety keeps\r\ntrue to its kind. But occasionally, at long intervals of time, a tree\r\nin England, or under the widely different climate of Virginia, produces\r\na single bud, and this yields a branch which ever afterwards bears\r\nnectarines. Nectarines differ, as every one knows, from peaches in\r\ntheir smoothness, size, and flavour; and the difference is so great\r\nthat some botanists have maintained that they are specifically\r\ndistinct. So permanent are the characters thus suddenly acquired, that\r\na nectarine produced by bud-variation has propagated itself by seed. To\r\nguard against the supposition that there is some fundamental\r\ndistinction between bud and seminal variation, it is well to bear in\r\nmind that nectarines have likewise been produced from the stone of the\r\npeach; and, reversely, peaches from the stone of the nectarine. Now is\r\nit possible to conceive external conditions more closely alike than\r\nthose to which the buds on the same tree are exposed? Yet one bud\r\nalone, out of the many thousands borne by the same tree, has suddenly,\r\nwithout any apparent cause, produced a nectarine. But the case is even\r\nstronger than this, for the same flower-bud has yielded a fruit,\r\none-half or one-quarter a nectarine, and the other half or\r\nthree-quarters a peach. Again, seven or eight varieties of the peach\r\nhave yielded by bud-variation nectarines: the nectarines thus produced,\r\nno doubt, differ a little from one another; but still they are\r\nnectarines. Of course there must be some cause, internal or external,\r\nto excite the peach-bud to change its nature; but I cannot imagine a\r\nclass of facts better adapted to force on our minds the conviction that\r\nwhat we call the external conditions of life are in many cases quite\r\ninsignificant in relation to any particular variation, in comparison\r\nwith the organisation or constitution of the being which varies.\r\n\r\nIt is known from the labours of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and recently\r\nfrom those of Dareste and others, that eggs of the fowl, if shaken,\r\nplaced upright, perforated, covered in part with varnish, etc., produce\r\nmonstrous chickens. Now these monstrosities may be said to be directly\r\ncaused by such unnatural conditions, but the modifications thus induced\r\nare not of a definite nature. An excellent observer, M. Camille\r\nDareste,[59] remarks “that the various species of monstrosities are not\r\ndetermined by specific causes; the external agencies which modify the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo act solely in causing a perturbation—a\r\nperversion in the normal course of development.” He compares the result\r\nto what we see in illness: a sudden chill, for instance, affects one\r\nindividual alone out of many, causing either a cold, or sore-throat,\r\nrheumatism, or inflammation of the lungs or pleura. Contagious matter\r\nacts in an analogous manner.[60] We may take a still more specific\r\ninstance: seven pigeons were struck by rattle-snakes:[61] some suffered\r\nfrom convulsions; some had their blood coagulated, in others it was\r\nperfectly fluid; some showed ecchymosed spots on the heart, others on\r\nthe intestines, etc.; others again showed no visible lesion in any\r\norgan. It is well known that excess in drinking causes different\r\ndiseases in different men; but in the tropics the effects of\r\nintemperance differ from those caused in a cold climate;[62] and in\r\nthis case we see the definite influence of opposite conditions. The\r\nforegoing facts apparently give us as good an idea as we are likely for\r\na long time to obtain, how in many cases external conditions act\r\ndirectly, though not definitely, in causing modifications of structure.\r\n\r\n_Summary._—There can be no doubt, from the facts given in this chapter,\r\nthat extremely slight changes in the conditions of life sometimes,\r\nprobably often, act in a definite manner on our domesticated\r\nproductions; and, as the action of changed conditions in causing\r\nindefinite variability is accumulative, so it may be with their\r\ndefinite action. Hence considerable and definite modifications of\r\nstructure probably follow from altered conditions acting during a long\r\nseries of generations. In some few instances a marked effect has been\r\nproduced quickly on all, or nearly all, the individuals which have been\r\nexposed to a marked change of climate, food, or other circumstance.\r\nThis has occurred with European men in the United States, with European\r\ndogs in India, with horses in the Falkland Islands, apparently with\r\nvarious animals at Angora, with foreign oysters in the Mediterranean,\r\nand with maize transported from one climate to another. We have seen\r\nthat the chemical compounds of some plants and the state of their\r\ntissues are readily affected by changed conditions. A relation\r\napparently exists between certain characters and certain conditions, so\r\nthat if the latter be changed the character is lost—as with the colours\r\nof flowers, the state of some culinary plants, the fruit of the melon,\r\nthe tail of fat-tailed sheep, and the peculiar fleeces of other sheep.\r\n\r\nThe production of galls, and the change of plumage in parrots when fed\r\non peculiar food or when inoculated by the poison of a toad, prove to\r\nus what great and mysterious changes in structure and colour, may be\r\nthe definite result of chemical changes in the nutrient fluids or\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nWe now almost certainly know that organic beings in a state of nature\r\nmay be modified in various definite ways by the conditions to which\r\nthey have been long exposed, as in the case of the birds and other\r\nanimals in the northern and southern United States, and of American\r\ntrees in comparison with their representatives in Europe. But in many\r\ncases it is most difficult to distinguish between the definite result\r\nof changed conditions, and the accumulation through natural selection\r\nof indefinite variations which have proved serviceable. If it profited\r\na plant to inhabit a humid instead of an arid station, a fitting change\r\nin its constitution might possibly result from the direct action of the\r\nenvironment, though we have no grounds for believing that variations of\r\nthe right kind would occur more frequently with plants inhabiting a\r\nstation a little more humid than usual, than with other plants. Whether\r\nthe station was unusually dry or humid, variations adapting the plant\r\nin a slight degree for directly opposite habits of life would\r\noccasionally arise, as we have good reason to believe from what we\r\nactually see in other cases.\r\n\r\nThe organisation or constitution of the being which is acted on, is\r\ngenerally a much more important element than the nature of the changed\r\nconditions, in determining the nature of the variation. We have\r\nevidence of this in the appearance of nearly similar modifications\r\nunder different conditions, and of different modifications under\r\napparently nearly the same conditions. We have still better evidence of\r\nthis in closely parallel varieties being frequently produced from\r\ndistinct races, or even distinct species; and in the frequent\r\nrecurrence of the same monstrosity in the same species. We have also\r\nseen that the degree to which domesticated birds have varied, does not\r\nstand in any close relation with the amount of change to which they\r\nhave been subjected.\r\n\r\nTo recur once again to bud-variations. When we reflect on the millions\r\nof buds which many trees have produced, before some one bud has varied,\r\nwe are lost in wonder as to what the precise cause of each variation\r\ncan be. Let us recall the case given by Andrew Knight of the\r\nforty-year-old tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum, an old variety\r\nwhich has been propagated by grafts on various stocks for a very long\r\nperiod throughout Europe and North America, and on which a single bud\r\nsuddenly produced the red magnum bonum. We should also bear in mind\r\nthat distinct varieties, and even distinct species,—as in the case of\r\npeaches, nectarines, and apricots,—of certain roses and\r\ncamellias,—although separated by a vast number of generations from any\r\nprogenitor in common, and although cultivated under diversified\r\nconditions, have yielded by bud-variation closely analogous varieties.\r\nWhen we reflect on these facts we become deeply impressed with the\r\nconviction that in such cases the nature of the variation depends but\r\nlittle on the conditions to which the plant has been exposed, and not\r\nin any especial manner on its individual character, but much more on\r\nthe inherited nature or constitution of the whole group of allied\r\nbeings to which the plant in question belongs. We are thus driven to\r\nconclude that in most cases the conditions of life play a subordinate\r\npart in causing any particular modification; like that which a spark\r\nplays, when a mass of combustibles bursts into flame—the nature of the\r\nflame depending on the combustible matter, and not on the spark.[63]\r\n\r\nNo doubt each slight variation must have its efficient cause; but it is\r\nas hopeless an attempt to discover the cause of each, as to say why a\r\nchill or a poison affects one man differently from another. Even with\r\nmodifications resulting from the definite action of the conditions of\r\nlife, when all or nearly all the individuals, which have been similarly\r\nexposed, are similarly affected, we can rarely see the precise relation\r\nbetween cause and effect. In the next chapter it will be shown that the\r\nincreased use or disuse of various organs produces an inherited effect.\r\nIt will further be seen that certain variations are bound together by\r\ncorrelation as well as by other laws. Beyond this we cannot at present\r\nexplain either the causes or nature of the variability of organic\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Ueber den Einfluss der Isolirung auf die Artbildung,’ 1872.\r\n\r\n [2] ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1853, p. 183.\r\n\r\n [3] Mr. Wildman, ‘Floricultural Soc.,’ Feb. 7th, 1843, reported in\r\n ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1843, p. 86.\r\n\r\n [4] Mr. Robson, in ‘Journal of Horticulture,’ Feb. 13th, 1866, p. 122.\r\n\r\n [5] ‘Journal of Horticulture,’ 1861, p. 24.\r\n\r\n [6] Ibid., 1862, p. 83.\r\n\r\n [7] ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1845, p. 660.\r\n\r\n [8] Ibid., 1863, p. 628.\r\n\r\n [9] ‘Journal of Hort.,’ 1861, pp. 64, 309.\r\n\r\n [10] ‘Des Variétés,’ etc., p. 76.\r\n\r\n [11] Engel, ‘Sur les Prop.

LAWS OF VARIATION—USE AND DISUSE, ETC.\r\n\r\nNISUS FORMATIVUS, OR THE CO-ORDINATING POWER OF THE ORGANISATION—ON THE\r\nEFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF ORGANS—CHANGED HABITS OF\r\nLIFE—ACCLIMATISATION WITH ANIMALS AND PLANTS—VARIOUS METHODS BY WHICH\r\nTHIS CAN BE EFFECTED—ARRESTS OF DEVELOPMENT—RUDIMENTARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this and the two following chapters I shall discuss, as well as the\r\ndifficulty of the subject permits, the several laws which govern\r\nVariability. These may be grouped under the effects of use and disuse,\r\nincluding changed habits and acclimatisation—arrest of\r\ndevelopment—correlated variation—the cohesion of homologous parts-the\r\nvariability of multiple parts—compensation of growth—the position of\r\nbuds with respect to the axis of the plant—and lastly, analogous\r\nvariation. These several subjects so graduate into one another that\r\ntheir distinction is often arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient first briefly to discuss that coordinating and\r\nreparative power which is common, in a higher or lower degree, to all\r\norganic beings, and which was formerly designated by physiologists as\r\n_nisus formativus._\r\n\r\nBlumenbach and others[1] have insisted that the principle which permits\r\na Hydra, when cut into fragments, to develop itself into two or more\r\nperfect animals, is the same with that which causes a wound in the\r\nhigher animals to heal by a cicatrice. Such cases as that of the Hydra\r\nare evidently analogous to the spontaneous division or fissiparous\r\ngeneration of the lowest animals, and likewise to the budding of\r\nplants. Between these extreme cases and that of a mere cicatrice we\r\nhave every gradation. Spallanzani[2] by cutting off the legs and tail\r\nof a Salamander, got in the course of three months six crops of these\r\nmembers; so that 687 perfect bones were reproduced by one animal during\r\none season. At whatever point the limb was cut off, the deficient part,\r\nand no more, was exactly reproduced. When a diseased bone has been\r\nremoved, a new one sometimes “gradually assumes the regular form, and\r\nall the attachments of muscles, ligaments, etc., become as complete as\r\nbefore.”[3]\r\n\r\nThis power of regrowth does not, however, always act perfectly; the\r\nreproduced tail of a lizard differs in the form of the scales from the\r\nnormal tail: with certain Orthopterous insects the large hind legs are\r\nreproduced of smaller size:[4] the white cicatrice which in the higher\r\nanimals unites the edges of a deep wound is not formed of perfect skin,\r\nfor elastic tissue is not produced till long afterwards.[5] “The\r\nactivity of the _nisus formativus,_” says Blumenbach, “is in an inverse\r\nratio to the age of the organised body.” Its power is also greater with\r\nanimals, the lower they stand in the scale of organisation; and animals\r\nlow in the scale correspond with the embryos of higher animals\r\nbelonging to the same class. Newport’s observations[6] afford a good\r\nillustration of this fact, for he found that “myriapods, whose highest\r\ndevelopment scarcely carries them beyond the larva of perfect insects,\r\ncan regenerate limbs and antennae up to the time of their last moult;”\r\nand so can the larvae of true insects, but, except in one order, not in\r\nthe mature insect. Salamanders correspond in development with the\r\ntadpoles or larvae of the tailless Batrachians, and both possess to a\r\nlarge extent the power of regrowth; but not so the mature tailless\r\nBatrachians.\r\n\r\nAbsorption often plays an important part in the repair of injuries.\r\nWhen a bone is broken and does not unite, the ends are absorbed and\r\nrounded, so that a false joint is formed; or if the ends unite, but\r\noverlap, the projecting parts are removed.[7] A dislocated bone will\r\nform for itself a new socket. Displaced tendons and varicose veins\r\nexcavate new channels in the bones against which they press. But\r\nabsorption comes into action, as Virchow remarks, during the normal\r\ngrowth of bones; parts which are solid during youth become hollowed out\r\nfor the medullary tissue as the bone increases in size. In trying to\r\nunderstand the many well-adapted cases of regrowth when aided by\r\nabsorption, we should remember that almost all parts of the\r\norganisation, even whilst retaining the same form, undergo constant\r\nrenewal; so that a part which is not renewed would be liable to\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nSome cases, usually classed under the so-called _nisus formativus,_ at\r\nfirst appear to come under a distinct head; for not only are old\r\nstructures reproduced, but new structures are formed. Thus, after\r\ninflammation “false membranes,” furnished with blood-vessels,\r\nlymphatics, and nerves, are developed; or a fœtus escapes from the\r\nFallopian tubes, and falls into the abdomen, “nature pours out a\r\nquantity of plastic lymph, which forms itself into organised membrane,\r\nrichly supplied with blood-vessels,” and the fœtus is nourished for a\r\ntime. In certain cases of hydrocephalus the open and dangerous spaces\r\nin the skull are filled up with new bones, which interlock by perfect\r\nserrated sutures.[8] But most physiologists, especially on the\r\nContinent, have now given up the belief in plastic lymph or blastema,\r\nand Virchow[9] maintains that every structure, new or old, is formed by\r\nthe proliferation of pre-existing cells. On this view false membranes,\r\nlike cancerous or other tumours, are merely abnormal developments of\r\nnormal growths; and we can thus understand how it is that they resemble\r\nadjoining structures; for instance, that a “false membrane in the\r\nserous cavities acquires a covering of epithelium exactly like that\r\nwhich covers the original serous membrane; adhesions of the iris may\r\nbecome black apparently from the production of pigment-cells like those\r\nof the uvea.”[10]\r\n\r\nNo doubt the power of reparation, though not always perfect, is an\r\nadmirable provision, ready for various emergencies, even for such as\r\noccur only at long intervals of time.[11] Yet this power is not more\r\nwonderful than the growth and development of every single creature,\r\nmore especially of those which are propagated by fissiparous\r\ngeneration. This subject has been here noticed, because we may infer\r\nthat, when any part or organ is either greatly increased in size or\r\nwholly suppressed through variation and continued selection, the\r\nco-ordinating power of the organisation will continually tend to bring\r\nagain all the parts into harmony with one another.\r\n\r\n      _On the Effects of the Increased Use and Disuse of Organs._\r\n\r\nIt is notorious, and we shall immediately adduce proofs, that increased\r\nuse or action strengthens muscles, glands, sense-organs, etc.; and that\r\ndisuse, on the other hand, weakens them. It has been experimentally\r\nproved by Ranke[12] that the flow of blood is greatly increased towards\r\nany part which is performing work, and sinks again when the part is at\r\nrest. Consequently, if the work is frequent, the vessels increase in\r\nsize and the part is better nourished. Paget[13] also accounts for the\r\nlong, thick, dark-coloured hairs which occasionally grow, even in young\r\nchildren, near old-standing inflamed surfaces or fractured bones by an\r\nincreased flow of blood to the part. When Hunter inserted the spur of a\r\ncock into the comb, which is well supplied with blood-vessels, it grew\r\nin one case spirally to a length of six inches, and in another case\r\nforward, like a horn, so that the bird could not touch the ground with\r\nits beak. According to the interesting observations of M. Sedillot,[14]\r\nwhen a portion of one of the bones of the leg of an animal is removed,\r\nthe associated bone enlarges till it attains a bulk equal to that of\r\nthe two bones, of which it has to perform the functions. This is best\r\nexhibited in dogs in which the tibia has been removed; the companion\r\nbone, which is naturally almost filiform and not one-fifth the size of\r\nthe other, soon acquires a size equal to or greater than that of the\r\ntibia. Now, it is at first difficult to believe that increased weight\r\nacting on a straight bone could, by alternately increasing and\r\ndiminishing the pressure, cause the blood to flow more freely in the\r\nvessels which permeate the periosteum and thus supply more nutriment to\r\nthe bone. Nevertheless the observations adduced by Mr. Spencer,[15] on\r\nthe strengthening of the bowed bones of rickety children, along their\r\nconcave sides, leads to the belief that this is possible.\r\n\r\nThe rocking of the stem of a tree increases in a marked manner the\r\ngrowth of the woody tissue in the parts which are strained. Prof. Sachs\r\nbelieves, from reasons which he assigns, that this is due to the\r\npressure of the bark being relaxed in such parts, and not as Knight and\r\nH. Spencer maintain, to an increased flow of sap caused by the movement\r\nof the trunk.[16] But hard woody tissue may be developed without the\r\naid of any movement, as we see with ivy closely attached to an old\r\nwall. In all such cases, it is very difficult to distinguish between\r\nthe effects of long-continued selection and those which follow from the\r\nincreased action of the part, or directly from some other cause. Mr. H.\r\nSpencer[17] acknowledges this difficulty, and gives as an instance the\r\nthorns on trees and the shells of nuts. Here we have extremely hard\r\nwoody tissue without the possibility of any movement, and without, as\r\nfar as we can see, any other directly exciting cause; and as the\r\nhardness of these parts is of manifest service to the plant, we may\r\nlook at the result as probably due to the selection of so-called\r\nspontaneous variations. Every one knows that hard work thickens the\r\nepidermis on the hands; and when we hear that with infants, long before\r\nbirth, the epidermis is thicker on the palms and soles of the feet than\r\non any other part of the body, as was observed with admiration by\r\nAlbinus,[18] we are naturally inclined to attribute this to the\r\ninherited effects of long-continued use or pressure. We are tempted to\r\nextend the same view even to the hoofs of quadrupeds; but who will\r\npretend to determine how far natural selection may have aided in the\r\nformation of structures of such obvious importance to the animal?\r\n\r\nThat use strengthens the muscles may be seen in the limbs of artisans\r\nwho follow different trades; and when a muscle is strengthened, the\r\ntendons, and the crests of bone to which they are attached, become\r\nenlarged; and this must likewise be the case with the blood-vessels and\r\nnerves. On the other hand, when a limb is not used, as by Eastern\r\nfanatics, or when the nerve supplying it with nervous power is\r\neffectually destroyed, the muscles wither. So again, when the eye is\r\ndestroyed the optic nerve becomes atrophied, sometimes even in the\r\ncourse of a few months.[19] The Proteus is furnished with branchiae as\r\nwell as with lungs: and Schreibers[20] found that when the animal was\r\ncompelled to live in deep water, the branchiae were developed to thrice\r\ntheir ordinary size, and the lungs were partially atrophied. When, on\r\nthe other hand, the animal was compelled to live in shallow water, the\r\nlungs became larger and more vascular, whilst the branchiae disappeared\r\nin a more or less complete degree. Such modifications as these are,\r\nhowever, of comparatively little value for us, as we do not actually\r\nknow that they tend to be inherited.\r\n\r\nIn many cases there is reason to believe that the lessened use of\r\nvarious organs has affected the corresponding parts in the offspring.\r\nBut there is no good evidence that this ever follows in the course of a\r\nsingle generation. It appears, as in the case of general or indefinite\r\nvariability, that several generations must be subjected to changed\r\nhabits for any appreciable result. Our domestic fowls, ducks, and geese\r\nhave almost lost, not only in the individual but in the race, their\r\npower of flight; for we do not see a young fowl, when frightened, take\r\nflight like a young pheasant. Hence I was led carefully to compare the\r\nlimb-bones of fowls, ducks, pigeons, and rabbits, with the same bones\r\nin the wild parent-species. As the measurements and weights were fully\r\ngiven in the earlier chapters I need here only recapitulate the\r\nresults. With domestic pigeons, the length of the sternum, the\r\nprominence of its crest, the length of the scapulae and furculum, the\r\nlength of the wings as measured from tip to tip of the radii, are all\r\nreduced relatively to the same parts in the wild pigeon. The wing and\r\ntail feathers, however, are increased in length, but this may have as\r\nlittle connection with the use of the wings or tail, as the lengthened\r\nhair on a dog with the amount of exercise which it has habitually\r\ntaken. The feet of pigeons, except in the long-beaked races, are\r\nreduced in size. With fowls the crest of the sternum is less prominent,\r\nand is often distorted or monstrous; the wing-bones have become lighter\r\nrelatively to the leg-bones, and are apparently a little shorter in\r\ncomparison with those of the parent-form, the _Gallus bankiva._ With\r\nducks, the crest of the sternum is affected in the same manner as in\r\nthe foregoing cases: the furculum, coracoids, and scapulae are all\r\nreduced in weight relatively to the whole skeleton: the bones of the\r\nwings are shorter and lighter, and the bones of the legs longer and\r\nheavier, relatively to each other, and relatively to the whole\r\nskeleton, in comparison with the same bones in the wild-duck. The\r\ndecreased weight and size of the bones, in the foregoing cases, is\r\nprobably the indirect result of the reaction of the weakened muscles on\r\nthe bones. I failed to compare the feathers of the wings of the tame\r\nand wild duck; but Gloger[21] asserts that in the wild duck the tips of\r\nthe wing-feathers reach almost to the end of the tail, whilst in the\r\ndomestic duck they often hardly reach to its base. He remarks also on\r\nthe greater thickness of the legs, and says that the swimming membrane\r\nbetween the toes is reduced; but I was not able to detect this latter\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nWith the domesticated rabbit the body, together with the whole\r\nskeleton, is generally larger and heavier than in the wild animal, and\r\nthe leg-bones are heavier in due proportion; but whatever standard of\r\ncomparison be taken, neither the leg-bones nor the scapulae have\r\nincreased in length proportionally with the increased dimensions of the\r\nrest of the skeleton. The skull has become in a marked manner narrower,\r\nand, from the measurements of its capacity formerly given, we may\r\nconclude, that this narrowness results from the decreased size of the\r\nbrain, consequent on the mentally inactive life led by these\r\nclosely-confined animals.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the eighth chapter that silk-moths, which have been\r\nkept during many centuries closely confined, emerge from their cocoons\r\nwith their wings distorted, incapable of flight, often greatly reduced\r\nin size, or even, according to Quatrefages, quite rudimentary. This\r\ncondition of the wings may be largely owing to the same kind of\r\nmonstrosity which often affects wild Lepidoptera when artificially\r\nreared from the cocoon; or it may be in part due to an inherent\r\ntendency, which is common to the females of many Bombycidae, to have\r\ntheir wings in a more or less rudimentary state; but part of the effect\r\nmay be attributed to long-continued disuse.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts there can be no doubt that with our anciently\r\ndomesticated animals, certain bones have increased or decreased in size\r\nand weight owing to increased or decreased use; but they have not been\r\nmodified, as shown in the earlier chapters, in shape or structure. With\r\nanimals living a free life and occasionally exposed to severe\r\ncompetition the reduction would tend to be greater, as it would be an\r\nadvantage to them to have the development of every superfluous part\r\nsaved. With highly-fed domesticated animals, on the other hand, there\r\nseems to be no economy of growth, nor any tendency to the elimination\r\nof superfluous details. But to this subject I shall recur.\r\n\r\nTurning now to more general observations, Nathusius has shown that with\r\nthe improved races of the pig, the shortened legs and snout, the form\r\nof the articular condyles of the occiput, and the position of the jaws\r\nwith the upper canine teeth projecting in a most anomalous manner in\r\nfront of the lower canines, may be attributed to these parts not having\r\nbeen fully exercised. For the highly-cultivated races do not travel in\r\nsearch of food, nor root up the ground with their ringed muzzles.[22]\r\nThese modifications of structure, which are all strictly inherited,\r\ncharacterise several improved breeds, so that they cannot have been\r\nderived from any single domestic stock. With respect to cattle,\r\nProfessor Tanner has remarked that the lungs and liver in the improved\r\nbreeds “are found to be considerably reduced in size when compared with\r\nthose possessed by animals having perfect liberty”;[23] and the\r\nreduction of these organs affects the general shape of the body. The\r\ncause of the reduced lungs in highly-bred animals which take little\r\nexercise is obvious; and perhaps the liver may be affected by the\r\nnutritious and artificial food on which they largely subsist. Again,\r\nDr. Wilckens asserts[24] that various parts of the body certainly\r\ndiffer in Alpine and lowland breeds of several domesticated animals,\r\nowing to their different habits of life; for instance, the neck and\r\nfore-legs in length, and the hoofs in shape.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that, when an artery is tied, the anastomosing\r\nbranches, from being forced to transmit more blood, increase in\r\ndiameter; and this increase cannot be accounted for by mere extension,\r\nas their coats gain in strength. With respect to glands, Sir J. Paget\r\nobserves that “when one kidney is destroyed the other often becomes\r\nmuch larger, and does double work.”[25] If we compare the size of the\r\nudders and their power of secretion in cows which have been long\r\ndomesticated, and in certain breeds of the goat in which the udders\r\nnearly touch the ground, with these organs in wild or half-domesticated\r\nanimals, the difference is great. A good cow with us daily yields more\r\nthan five gallons, or forty pints of milk, whilst a first-rate animal,\r\nkept, for instance, by the Damaras of South Africa,[26] “rarely gives\r\nmore than two or three pints of milk daily, and, should her calf be\r\ntaken from her, she absolutely refuses to give any.” We may attribute\r\nthe excellence of our cows and of certain goats, partly to the\r\ncontinued selection of the best milking animals, and partly to the\r\ninherited effects of the increased action, through man’s art, of the\r\nsecreting glands.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that short-sight is inherited; and we have seen in the\r\ntwelfth chapter from the statistical researches of M. Giraud-Teulon,\r\nthat the habit of viewing near objects gives a tendency to short-sight.\r\nVeterinarians are unanimous that horses are affected with spavins,\r\nsplints, ringbones, etc., from being shod and from travelling on hard\r\nroads, and they are almost equally unanimous that a tendency to these\r\nmalformations is transmitted. Formerly horses were not shod in North\r\nCarolina, and it has been asserted that they did not then suffer from\r\nthese diseases of the legs and feet.[27]\r\n\r\nOur domesticated quadrupeds are all descended, as far as is known, from\r\nspecies having erect ears; yet few kinds can be named, of which at\r\nleast one race has not drooping ears. Cats in China, horses in parts of\r\nRussia, sheep in Italy and elsewhere, the guinea-pig formerly in\r\nGermany, goats and cattle in India, rabbits, pigs, and dogs in all\r\nlong-civilised countries have dependent ears. With wild animals, which\r\nconstantly use their ears like funnels to catch every passing sound,\r\nand especially to ascertain the direction whence it comes, there is\r\nnot, as Mr. Blyth has remarked, any species with drooping ears except\r\nthe elephant. Hence the incapacity to erect the ears is certainly in\r\nsome manner the result of domestication; and this incapacity has been\r\nattributed by various authors[28] to disuse, for animals protected by\r\nman are not compelled habitually to use their ears. Col. Hamilton\r\nSmith[29] states that in ancient effigies of the dog, “with the\r\nexception of one Egyptian instance, no sculpture of the earlier Grecian\r\nera produces representations of hounds with completely drooping ears;\r\nthose with them half pendulous are missing in the most ancient; and\r\nthis character increases, by degrees, in the works of the Roman\r\nperiod.” Godron also has remarked “that the pigs of the ancient\r\nEgyptians had not their ears enlarged and pendent.”[30] But it is\r\nremarkable that the drooping of the ear is not accompanied by any\r\ndecrease in size; on the contrary, animals so different as fancy\r\nrabbits, certain Indian breeds of the goat, our petted spaniels,\r\nblood-hounds, and other dogs, have enormously elongated ears, so that\r\nit would appear as if their weight had caused them to droop, aided\r\nperhaps by disuse. With rabbits, the drooping of the much elongated\r\nears has affected even the structure of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe tail of no wild animal, as remarked to me by Mr. Blyth, is curled;\r\nwhereas pigs and some races of dogs have their tails much curled. This\r\ndeformity, therefore, appears to be the result of domestication, but\r\nwhether in any way connected with the lessened use of the tail is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis on our hands is easily thickened, as every one knows, by\r\nhard work. In a district of Ceylon the sheep have “horny callosities\r\nthat defend their knees, and which arise from their habit of kneeling\r\ndown to crop the short herbage, and this distinguishes the Jaffna\r\nflocks from those of other portions of the island;” but it is not\r\nstated whether this peculiarity is inherited.[31]\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane which lines the stomach is continuous with the\r\nexternal skin of the body; therefore it is not surprising that its\r\ntexture should be affected by the nature of the food consumed, but\r\nother and more interesting changes likewise follow. Hunter long ago\r\nobserved that the muscular coat of the stomach of a gull (_Larus\r\ntridactylus_) which had been fed for a year chiefly on grain was\r\nthickened; and, according to Dr. Edmondston, a similar change\r\nperiodically occurs in the Shetland Islands in the stomach of the\r\n_Larus argentatus,_ which in the spring frequents the cornfields and\r\nfeeds on the seed. The same careful observer has noticed a great change\r\nin the stomach of a raven which had been long fed on vegetable food. In\r\nthe case of an owl (_Strix grallaria_), similarly treated, Menetries\r\nstates that the form of the stomach was changed, the inner coat became\r\nleathery, and the liver increased in size. Whether these modifications\r\nin the digestive organs would in the course of generations become\r\ninherited is not known.[32]\r\n\r\nThe increased or diminished length of the intestines, which apparently\r\nresults from changed diet, is a more remarkable case, because it is\r\ncharacteristic of certain animals in their domesticated condition, and\r\ntherefore must be inherited. The complex absorbent system, the\r\nblood-vessels, nerves, and muscles, are necessarily all modified\r\ntogether with the intestines. According to Daubenton, the intestines of\r\nthe domestic cat are one-third longer than those of the wild cat of\r\nEurope; and although this species is not the parent-stock of the\r\ndomestic animal, yet, as Isidore Geoffroy has remarked, the several\r\nspecies of cats are so closely allied that the comparison is probably a\r\nfair one. The increased length appears to be due to the domestic cat\r\nbeing less strictly carnivorous in its diet than any wild feline\r\nspecies; for instance, I have seen a French kitten eating vegetables as\r\nreadily as meat. According to Cuvier, the intestines of the\r\ndomesticated pig exceed greatly in proportionate length those of the\r\nwild boar. In the tame and wild rabbit the change is of an opposite\r\nnature, and probably results from the nutritious food given to the tame\r\nrabbit.[33]\r\n\r\n_Changed and inherited Habits of Life._—This subject, as far as the\r\nmental powers of animals are concerned, so blends into instinct, that I\r\nwill here only remind the reader of such cases as the tameness of our\r\ndomesticated animals—the pointing or retrieving of dogs— their not\r\nattacking the smaller animals kept by man—and so forth. How much of\r\nthese changes ought to be attributed to mere habit, and how much to the\r\nselection of individuals which have varied in the desired manner,\r\nirrespectively of the special circumstances under which they have been\r\nkept, can seldom be told.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that animals may be habituated to a changed diet;\r\nbut some additional instances may be given. In the Polynesian Islands\r\nand in China the dog is fed exclusively on vegetable matter, and the\r\ntaste for this kind of food is to a certain extent inherited.[34] Our\r\nsporting dogs will not touch the bones of game birds, whilst most other\r\ndogs devour them with greediness. In some parts of the world sheep have\r\nbeen largely fed on fish. The domestic hog is fond of barley, the wild\r\nboar is said to disdain it; and the disdain is partially inherited, for\r\nsome young wild pigs bred in captivity showed an aversion for this\r\ngrain, whilst others of the same brood relished it.[35] One of my\r\nrelations bred some young pigs from a Chinese sow by a wild Alpine\r\nboar; they lived free in the park, and were so tame that they came to\r\nthe house to be fed; but they would not touch swill, which was devoured\r\nby the other pigs. An animal when once accustomed to an unnatural diet,\r\nwhich can generally be effected only during youth, dislikes its proper\r\nfood, as Spallanzani found to be the case with a pigeon which had been\r\nlong fed on meat. Individuals of the same species take to new food with\r\ndifferent degrees of readiness; one horse, it is stated, soon learned\r\nto eat meat, whilst another would have perished from hunger rather than\r\nhave partaken of it.[36] The caterpillars of the _Bombyx hesperus_ feed\r\nin a state of nature on the leaves of the _Café diable,_ but, after\r\nhaving been reared on the Ailanthus, they would not touch the _ Café\r\ndiable,_ and actually died of hunger.[37]\r\n\r\nIt has been found possible to accustom marine fish to live in fresh\r\nwater; but as such changes in fish and other marine animals have been\r\nchiefly observed in a state of nature, they do not properly belong to\r\nour present subject. The period of gestation and of maturity, as shown\r\nin the earlier chapters,—the season and the frequency of the act of\r\nbreeding,—have all been greatly modified under domestication. With the\r\nEgyptian goose the rate of change with respect to the season has been\r\nrecorded.[38] The wild drake pairs with one female, the domestic drake\r\nis polygamous. Certain breeds of fowls have lost the habit of\r\nincubation. The paces of the horse, and the manner of flight of certain\r\nbreeds of the pigeon, have been modified and are inherited. Cattle,\r\nhorses, and pigs have learnt to browse under water in the St. John’s\r\nRiver, East Florida, where the Vallisneria has been largely\r\nnaturalised. The cows were observed by Prof. Wyman to keep their heads\r\nimmersed for “a period varying from fifteen to thirty-five\r\nseconds.”[39] The voice differs much in certain kinds of fowls and\r\npigeons. Some varieties are clamorous and others silent, as the Call\r\nand common duck, or the Spitz and pointer dog. Every one knows how the\r\nbreeds of the dog differ from one another in their manner of hunting,\r\nand in their ardour after different kinds of game or vermin.\r\n\r\nWith plants the period of vegetation is easily changed and is\r\ninherited, as in the case of summer and winter wheat, barley, and\r\nvetches; but to this subject we shall immediately return under\r\nacclimatisation. Annual plants sometimes become perennial under a new\r\nclimate, as I hear from Dr. Hooker is the case with the stock and\r\nmignonette in Tasmania. On the other hand, perennials sometimes become\r\nannuals, as with the Ricinus in England, and as, according to Captain\r\nMangles, with many varieties of the heartsease. Von Berg[40] raised\r\nfrom seed of _Verbascum phœniceum,_ which is usually a biennial, both\r\nannual and perennial varieties. Some deciduous bushes become evergreen\r\nin hot countries.[41] Rice requires much water, but there is one\r\nvariety in India which can be grown without irrigation.[42] Certain\r\nvarieties of the oat and of our other cereals are best fitted for\r\ncertain soils.[43] Endless similar facts could be given in the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdoms. They are noticed here because they illustrate\r\nanalogous differences in closely allied natural species, and because\r\nsuch changed habits of life, whether due to habit, or to the direct\r\naction of external conditions, or to so-called spontaneous variability,\r\nwould be apt to lead to modifications of structure.\r\n\r\n_Acclimatisation._—From the previous remarks we are naturally led to\r\nthe much disputed subject of acclimatisation. There are two distinct\r\nquestions: Do varieties descended from the same species differ in their\r\npower of living under different climates? And secondly, if they so\r\ndiffer, how have they become thus adapted? We have seen that European\r\ndogs do not succeed well in India, and it is asserted,[44] that no one\r\nhas there succeeded in keeping the Newfoundland long alive; but then it\r\nmay be argued, and probably with truth, that these northern breeds are\r\nspecifically distinct from the native dogs which flourish in India. The\r\nsame remark may be made with respect to different breeds of sheep, of\r\nwhich, according to Youatt,[45] not one brought “from a torrid climate\r\nlasts out the second year,” in the Zoological Gardens. But sheep are\r\ncapable of some degree of acclimatisation, for Merino sheep bred at the\r\nCape of Good Hope have been found far better adapted for India than\r\nthose imported from England.[46] It is almost certain that all the\r\nbreeds of the fowl are descended from one species; but the Spanish\r\nbreed, which there is good reason to believe originated near the\r\nMediterranean,[47] though so fine and vigorous in England, suffers more\r\nfrom frost than any other breed. The Arrindy silk moth introduced from\r\nBengal, and the Ailanthus moth from the temperate province of Shan\r\nTung, in China, belong to the same species, as we may infer from their\r\nidentity in the caterpillar, cocoon, and mature states;[48] yet they\r\ndiffer much in constitution: the Indian form “will flourish only in\r\nwarm latitudes,” the other is quite hardy and withstands cold and rain.\r\n\r\nPlants are more strictly adapted to climate than are animals. The\r\nlatter when domesticated withstand such great diversities of climate,\r\nthat we find nearly the same species in tropical and temperate\r\ncountries; whilst the cultivated plants are widely dissimilar. Hence a\r\nlarger field is open for inquiry in regard to the acclimatisation of\r\nplants than of animals. It is no exaggeration to say that with almost\r\nevery plant which has long been cultivated, varieties exist which are\r\nendowed with constitutions fitted for very different climates; I will\r\nselect only a few of the more striking cases, as it would be tedious to\r\ngive all. In North America numerous fruit-trees have been raised, and\r\nin horticultural publications,—for instance, in that by Downing,—lists\r\nare given of the varieties which are best able to withstand the severe\r\nclimate of the northern States and Canada. Many American varieties of\r\nthe pear, plum, and peach are excellent in their own country, but until\r\nrecently, hardly one was known that succeeded in England; and with\r\napples,[49] not one succeeds. Though the American varieties can\r\nwithstand a severer winter than ours, the summer here is not hot\r\nenough. Fruit-trees have also originated in Europe with different\r\nconstitutions, but they are not much noticed, because nurserymen here\r\ndo not supply wide areas. The Forelle pear flowers early, and when the\r\nflowers have just set, and this is the critical period, they have been\r\nobserved, both in France and England, to withstand with complete\r\nimpunity a frost of 18 deg and even 14° Fahr., which killed the\r\nflowers, whether fully expanded or in bud, of all other kinds of\r\npears.[50] This power in the flower of resisting cold and afterwards\r\nproducing fruit does not invariably depend, as we know on good\r\nauthority,[51] on general constitutional vigour. In proceeding\r\nnorthward, the number of varieties which are found capable of resisting\r\nthe climate rapidly decreases, as may be seen in the list of the\r\nvarieties of the cherry, apple, and pear, which can be cultivated in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Stockholm.[52] Near Moscow, Prince Troubetzkoy\r\nplanted for experiment in the open ground several varieties of the\r\npear, but one alone, the _Poire sans Pepins,_ withstood the cold of\r\nwinter.[53] We thus see that our fruit-trees, like distinct species of\r\nthe same genus, certainly differ from each other in their\r\nconstitutional adaptation to different climates.\r\n\r\nWith the varieties of many plants, the adaptation to climate is often\r\nvery close. Thus it has been proved by repeated trials “that few if any\r\nof the English varieties of wheat are adapted for cultivation in\r\nScotland”;[54] but the failure in this case is at first only in the\r\nquantity, though ultimately in the quality, of the grain produced. The\r\nRev. M. J. Berkeley sowed wheat-seed from India, and got “the most\r\nmeagre ears,” on land which would certainly have yielded a good crop\r\nfrom English wheat.[55] In these cases varieties have been carried from\r\na warmer to a cooler climate; in the reverse case, as “when wheat was\r\nimported directly from France into the West Indian Islands, it produced\r\neither wholly barren spikes or furnished with only two or three\r\nmiserable seeds, while West Indian seed by its side yielded an enormous\r\nharvest.”[56] Here is another case of close adaptation to a slightly\r\ncooler climate; a kind of wheat which in England may be used\r\nindifferently either as a winter or summer variety, when sown under the\r\nwarmer climate of Grignan, in France, behaved exactly as if it had been\r\na true winter wheat.[57]\r\n\r\nBotanists believe that all the varieties of maize belong to the same\r\nspecies; and we have seen that in North America, in proceeding\r\nnorthward, the varieties cultivated in each zone produce their flowers\r\nand ripen their seed within shorter and shorter periods. So that the\r\ntall, slowly maturing southern varieties do not succeed in New England,\r\nand the New English varieties do not succeed in Canada. I have not met\r\nwith any statement that the southern varieties are actually injured or\r\nkilled by a degree of cold which the northern varieties can withstand\r\nwith impunity, though this is probable; but the production of early\r\nflowering and early seeding varieties deserves to be considered as one\r\nform of acclimatisation. Hence it has been found possible, according to\r\nKalm, to cultivate maize further and further northwards in America. In\r\nEurope, also, as we learn from the evidence given by Alph. De Candolle,\r\nthe culture of maize has extended since the end of the last century\r\nthirty leagues north of its former boundary.[58] On the authority of\r\nLinnæus,[59] I may quote an analogous case, namely, that in Sweden\r\ntobacco raised from home-grown seed ripens its seed a month sooner and\r\nis less liable to miscarry than plants raised from foreign seed.\r\n\r\nWith the Vine, differently from the maize, the line of practical\r\nculture has retreated a little southward since the middle ages;[60] but\r\nthis seems due to commerce being now easier, so that it is better to\r\nimport wine from the south than to make it in northern districts.\r\nNevertheless the fact of the vine not having spread northward shows\r\nthat acclimatisation has made no progress during several centuries.\r\nThere is, however, a marked difference in the constitution of the\r\nseveral varieties,— some being hardy, whilst others, like the muscat of\r\nAlexandria, require a very high temperature to come to perfection.\r\nAccording to Labat,[61] vines taken from France to the West Indies\r\nsucceed with extreme difficulty, whilst those imported from Madeira or\r\nthe Canary Islands thrive admirably.\r\n\r\nGallesio gives a curious account of the naturalisation of the Orange in\r\nItaly. During many centuries the sweet orange was propagated\r\nexclusively by grafts, and so often suffered from frosts, that it\r\nrequired protection. After the severe frost of 1709, and more\r\nespecially after that of 1763, so many trees were destroyed, that\r\nseedlings from the sweet orange were raised, and, to the surprise of\r\nthe inhabitants, their fruit was found to be sweet. The trees thus\r\nraised were larger, more productive, and hardier than the old kinds;\r\nand seedlings are now continually raised. Hence Gallesio concludes that\r\nmuch more was effected for the naturalisation of the orange in Italy by\r\nthe accidental production of new kinds during a period of about sixty\r\nyears, than had been effected by grafting old varieties during many\r\nages.[62] I may add that Risso[63] describes some Portuguese varieties\r\nof the orange as extremely sensitive to cold, and as much tenderer than\r\ncertain other varieties.\r\n\r\nThe peach was known to Theophrastus, 322 B.C.[64] According to the\r\nauthorities quoted by Dr. F. Rolle,[65] it was tender when first\r\nintroduced into Greece, and even in the island of Rhodes only\r\noccasionally bore fruit. If this be correct, the peach, in spreading\r\nduring the last two thousand years over the middle parts of Europe,\r\nmust have become much hardier. At the present day different varieties\r\ndiffer much in hardiness: some French varieties will not succeed in\r\nEngland; and near Paris, the _Pavie de Bonneuil_ does not ripen its\r\nfruit till very late in the season, even when grown on a wall; “it is,\r\ntherefore, only fit for a very hot southern climate.”[66]\r\n\r\nI will briefly give a few other cases. A variety of _Magnolia\r\ngrandiflora,_ raised by M. Roy, withstands a temperature several\r\ndegrees lower than that which any other variety can resist. With\r\ncamellias there is much difference in hardiness. One particular variety\r\nof the Noisette rose withstood the severe frost of 1860 “untouched and\r\nhale amidst a universal destruction of other Noisettes.” In New York\r\nthe “Irish yew is quite hardy, but the common yew is liable to be cut\r\ndown.” I may add that there are varieties of the sweet potato\r\n(_Convolvulus batatas_) which are suited for warmer, as well as for\r\ncolder, climates.[67]\r\n\r\nThe plants as yet mentioned have been found capable of resisting an\r\nunusual degree of cold or heat, when fully grown. The following cases\r\nrefer to plants whilst young. In a large bed of young Araucarias of the\r\nsame age, growing close together and equally exposed, it was\r\nobserved,[68] after the unusually severe winter of 1860-61, that, “in\r\nthe midst of the dying, numerous individuals remained on which the\r\nfrost had absolutely made no kind of impression.” Dr. Lindley, after\r\nalluding to this and other similar cases, remarks, “Among the lessons\r\nwhich the late formidable winter has taught us, is that, even in their\r\npower of resisting cold, individuals of the same species of plants are\r\nremarkably different.” Near Salisbury, there was a sharp frost on the\r\nnight of May 24, 1836, and all the French beans (_Phaseolus vulgaris_)\r\nin a bed were killed except about one in thirty, which completely\r\nescaped.[69] On the same day of the month, but in the year 1864, there\r\nwas a severe frost in Kent, and two rows of scarlet-runners (_P.\r\nmultiflorus_) in my garden, containing 390 plants of the same age and\r\nequally exposed, were all blackened and killed except about a dozen\r\nplants. In an adjoining row of “Fulmer’s dwarf bean” (_P. vulgaris_),\r\none single plant escaped. A still more severe frost occurred four days\r\nafterwards, and of the dozen plants which had previously escaped only\r\nthree survived; these were not taller or more vigorous than the other\r\nyoung plants, but they escaped completely, with not even the tips of\r\ntheir leaves browned. It was impossible to behold these three plants,\r\nwith their blackened, withered, and dead brethren all around, and not\r\nsee at a glance that they differed widely in constitutional power of\r\nresisting frost.\r\n\r\nThis work is not the proper place to show that wild plants of the same\r\nspecies, naturally growing at different altitudes or under different\r\nlatitudes, become to a certain extent acclimatised, as is proved by the\r\ndifferent behaviour of their seedlings when raised in another country.\r\nIn my ‘Origin of Species’ I have alluded to some cases, and I could add\r\nmany others. One instance must suffice: Mr. Grigor, of Forres,[70]\r\nstates that seedlings of the Scotch fir (_Pinus sylvestris_), raised\r\nfrom seed from the Continent and from the forests of Scotland, differ\r\nmuch. “The difference is perceptible in one-year-old, and more so in\r\ntwo-year-old seedlings; but the effects of the winter on the second\r\nyear’s growth almost uniformly make those from the Continent quite\r\nbrown, and so damaged, that by the month of March they are quite\r\nunsaleable, while the plants from the native Scotch pine, under the\r\nsame treatment, and standing alongside, although considerably shorter,\r\nare rather stouter and quite green, so that the beds of the one can be\r\nknown from the other when seen from the distance of a mile.” Closely\r\nsimilar facts have been observed with seedling larches.\r\n\r\nHardy varieties would alone be valued or noticed in Europe; whilst\r\ntender varieties, requiring more warmth, would generally be neglected;\r\nbut such occasionally arise. Thus Loudon[71] describes a Cornish\r\nvariety of the elm which is almost an evergreen, and of which the\r\nshoots are often killed by the autumnal frosts, so that its timber is\r\nof little value. Horticulturists know that some varieties are much more\r\ntender than others: thus all the varieties of the broccoli are more\r\ntender than cabbages; but there is much difference in this respect in\r\nthe sub-varieties of the broccoli; the pink and purple kinds are a\r\nlittle hardier than the white Cape broccoli, “but they are not to be\r\ndepended on after the thermometer falls below 24° Fahr.;” the Walcheren\r\nbroccoli is less tender than the Cape, and there are several varieties\r\nwhich will stand much severer cold than the Walcheren.[72] Cauliflowers\r\nseed more freely in India than cabbages.[73] To give one instance with\r\nflowers: eleven plants raised from a hollyhock, called the _Queen of\r\nthe Whites,_[74] were found to be much more tender than various other\r\nseedlings. It may be presumed that all tender varieties would succeed\r\nbetter under a climate warmer than ours. With fruit-trees, it is well\r\nknown that certain varieties, for instance of the peach, stand forcing\r\nin a hot-house better than others; and this shows either pliability of\r\norganisation or some constitutional difference. The same individual\r\ncherry-tree, when forced, has been observed during successive years\r\ngradually to change its period of vegetation.[75] Few pelargoniums can\r\nresist the heat of a stove, but _Alba Multiflora_ will, as a most\r\nskilful gardener asserts, “stand pine-apple top and bottom heat the\r\nwhole winter; without looking any more drawn than if it had stood in a\r\ncommon greenhouse; and _ Blanche Fleur_ seems as if it had been made on\r\npurpose for growing in winter, like many bulbs, and to rest all\r\nsummer.”[76] There can hardly be a doubt that the _Alba Multiflora_\r\npelargonium must have a widely different constitution from that of most\r\nother varieties of this plant; it would probably withstand even an\r\nequatorial climate.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that according to Labat the vine and wheat require\r\nacclimatisation in order to succeed in the West Indies. Similar facts\r\nhave been observed at Madras: “two parcels of mignonette-seed, one\r\ndirect from Europe, the other saved at Bangalore (of which the mean\r\ntemperature is much below that of Madras), were sown at the same time:\r\nthey both vegetated equally favourably, but the former all died off a\r\nfew days after they appeared above ground; the latter still survive,\r\nand are vigorous, healthy plants.” “So again, turnip and carrot seed\r\nsaved at Hyderabad are found to answer better at Madras than seed from\r\nEurope or from the Cape of Good Hope.”[77] Mr. J. Scott of the Calcutta\r\nBotanic Gardens, informs me that seeds of the sweet-pea (_Lathyrus\r\nodoratus_) imported from England produce plants, with thick, rigid\r\nstems and small leaves, which rarely blossom and never yield seed;\r\nplants raised from French seed blossom sparingly, but all the flowers\r\nare sterile; on the other hand, plants raised from sweet-peas grown\r\nnear Darjeeling in Upper India, but originally derived from England,\r\ncan be successfully cultivated on the plains of India; for they flower\r\nand seed profusely, and their stems are lax and scandent. In some of\r\nthe foregoing cases, as Dr. Hooker has remarked to me, the greater\r\nsuccess may perhaps be attributed to the seeds having been more fully\r\nripened under a more favourable climate; but this view can hardly be\r\nextended to so many cases, including plants, which, from being\r\ncultivated under a climate hotter than their native one, become fitted\r\nfor a still hotter climate. We may therefore safely conclude that\r\nplants can to a certain extent become accustomed to a climate either\r\nhotter or colder than their own; although the latter cases have been\r\nmore frequently observed.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the means by which acclimatisation may be\r\neffected, namely, through the appearance of varieties having a\r\ndifferent constitution, and through the effects of habit. In regard to\r\nnew varieties, there is no evidence that a change in the constitution\r\nof the offspring necessarily stands in any direct relation with the\r\nnature of the climate inhabited by the parents. On the contrary, it is\r\ncertain that hardy and tender varieties of the same species appear in\r\nthe same country. New varieties thus spontaneously arising become\r\nfitted to slightly different climates in two different ways; firstly,\r\nthey may have the power, either as seedlings or when full-grown, of\r\nresisting intense cold, as with the Moscow pear, or of resisting\r\nintense heat, as with some kinds of Pelargonium, or the flowers may\r\nwithstand severe frost, as with the Forelle pear. Secondly, plants may\r\nbecome adapted to climates widely different from their own, from\r\nflowering and fruiting either earlier or later in the season. In both\r\nthese cases the power of acclimatisation by man consists simply in the\r\nselection and preservation of new varieties. But without any direct\r\nintention on his part of securing a hardier variety, acclimatisation\r\nmay be unconsciously effected by merely raising tender plants from\r\nseed, and by occasionally attempting their cultivation further and\r\nfurther northwards, as in the case of maize, the orange and the peach.\r\n\r\nHow much influence ought to be attributed to inherited habit or custom\r\nin the acclimatisation of animals and plants is a much more difficult\r\nquestion. In many cases natural selection can hardly have failed to\r\nhave come into play and complicated the result. It is notorious that\r\nmountain sheep resist severe weather and storms of snow which would\r\ndestroy lowland breeds; but then mountain sheep have been thus exposed\r\nfrom time immemorial, and all delicate individuals will have been\r\ndestroyed, and the hardiest preserved. So with the Arrindy silk-moths\r\nof China and India; who can tell how far natural selection may have\r\ntaken a share in the formation of the two races, which are now fitted\r\nfor such widely different climates? It seems at first probable that the\r\nmany fruit-trees which are so well fitted for the hot summers and cold\r\nwinters of North America, in contrast with their poor success under our\r\nclimate, have become adapted through habit; but when we reflect on the\r\nmultitude of seedlings annually raised in that country, and that none\r\nwould succeed unless born with a fitting constitution, it is possible\r\nthat mere habit may have done nothing towards their acclimatisation. On\r\nthe other hand, when we hear that Merino sheep, bred during no great\r\nnumber of generations at the Cape of Good Hope—that some European\r\nplants raised during only a few generations in the cooler parts of\r\nIndia, withstand the hotter parts of that country much better than the\r\nsheep or seeds imported directly from England, we must attribute some\r\ninfluence to habit. We are led to the same conclusion when we hear from\r\nNaudin[78] that the races of melons, squashes, and gourds, which have\r\nlong been cultivated in Northern Europe, are comparatively more\r\nprecocious, and need much less heat for maturing their fruit, than the\r\nvarieties of the same species recently brought from tropical regions.\r\nIn the reciprocal conversion of summer and winter wheat, barley, and\r\nvetches into each other, habit produces a marked effect in the course\r\nof a very few generations. The same thing apparently occurs with the\r\nvarieties of maize, which, when carried from the Southern States of\r\nAmerica, or into Germany, soon became accustomed to their new homes.\r\nWith vine-plants taken to the West Indies from Madeira, which are said\r\nto succeed better than plants brought directly from France, we have\r\nsome degree of acclimatisation in the individual, independently of the\r\nproduction of new varieties by seed.\r\n\r\nThe common experience of agriculturists is of some value, and they\r\noften advise persons to be cautious in trying the productions of one\r\ncountry in another. The ancient agricultural writers of China recommend\r\nthe preservation and cultivation of the varieties peculiar to each\r\ncountry. During the classical period, Columella wrote, “Vernaculum\r\npecus peregrino longe præstantius est.”[79]\r\n\r\nI am aware that the attempt to acclimatise either animals or plants has\r\nbeen called a vain chimera. No doubt the attempt in most cases deserves\r\nto be thus called, if made independently of the production of new\r\nvarieties endowed with a different constitution. With plants propagated\r\nby buds, habit rarely produces any effect; it apparently acts only\r\nthrough successive seminal generations. The laurel, bay, laurestinus,\r\netc., and the Jerusalem artichoke, which are propagated by cuttings or\r\ntubers, are probably now as tender in England as when first introduced;\r\nand this appears to be the case with the potato, which until recently\r\nwas seldom multiplied by seed. With plants propagated by seed, and with\r\nanimals, there will be little or no acclimatisation unless the hardier\r\nindividuals are either intentionally or unconsciously preserved. The\r\nkidney-bean has often been advanced as an instance of a plant which has\r\nnot become hardier since its first introduction into Britain. We hear,\r\nhowever, on excellent authority[80] that some very fine seed, imported\r\nfrom abroad, produced plants “which blossomed most profusely, but were\r\nnearly all but abortive, whilst plants grown alongside from English\r\nseed podded abundantly;” and this apparently shows some degree of\r\nacclimatisation in our English plants. We have also seen that seedlings\r\nof the kidney-bean occasionally appear with a marked power of resisting\r\nfrost; but no one, as far as I can hear, has ever separated such hardy\r\nseedlings, so as to prevent accidental crossing, and then gathered\r\ntheir seed, and repeated the process year after year. It may, however,\r\nbe objected with truth that natural selection ought to have had a\r\ndecided effect on the hardiness of our kidney-beans; for the tenderest\r\nindividuals must have been killed during every severe spring, and the\r\nhardier preserved. But it should be borne in mind that the result of\r\nincreased hardiness would simply be that gardeners, who are always\r\nanxious for as early a crop as possible, would sow their seed a few\r\ndays earlier than formerly. Now, as the period of sowing depends much\r\non the soil and elevation of each district, and varies with the season;\r\nand as new varieties have often been imported from abroad, can we feel\r\nsure that our kidney-beans are not somewhat hardier? I have not been\r\nable, by searching old horticultural works, to answer this question\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the facts now given show that, though habit does something\r\ntowards acclimatisation, yet that the appearance of constitutionally\r\ndifferent individuals is a far more effective agent. As no single\r\ninstance has been recorded either with animals or plants of hardier\r\nindividuals having been long and steadily selected, though such\r\nselection is admitted to be indispensable for the improvement of any\r\nother character, it is not surprising that man has done little in the\r\nacclimatisation of domesticated animals and cultivated plants. We need\r\nnot, however, doubt that under nature new races and new species would\r\nbecome adapted to widely different climates, by variation, aided by\r\nhabit, and regulated by natural selection.\r\n\r\n      _Arrests of Development: Rudimentary and Aborted Organs._\r\n\r\nModifications of structure from arrested development, so great or so\r\nserious as to deserve to be called monstrosities, are not infrequent\r\nwith domesticated animals, but, as they differ much from any normal\r\nstructure, they require only a passing notice. Thus the whole head may\r\nbe represented by a soft nipple-like projection, and the limbs by mere\r\npapillae. These rudiments of limbs are sometimes inherited, as has been\r\nobserved in a dog.[81]\r\n\r\nMany lesser anomalies appear to be due to arrested development. What\r\nthe cause of the arrest may be, we seldom know, except in the case of\r\ndirect injury to the embryo. That the cause does not generally act at\r\nan extremely early embryonic period we may infer from the affected\r\norgan seldom being wholly aborted,—a rudiment being generally\r\npreserved. The external ears are represented by mere vestiges in a\r\nChinese breed of sheep; and in another breed, the tail is reduced “to a\r\nlittle button, suffocated in a manner, by fat.”[82] In tailless dogs\r\nand cats a stump is left. In certain breeds of fowls the comb and\r\nwattles are reduced to rudiments; in the Cochin-China breed scarcely\r\nmore than rudiments of spurs exist. With polled Suffolk cattle,\r\n“rudiments of horns can often be felt at an early age”;[83] and with\r\nspecies in a state of nature, the relatively great development of\r\nrudimentary organs at an early period of life is highly characteristic\r\nof such organs. With hornless breeds of cattle and sheep, another and\r\nsingular kind of rudiment has been observed, namely, minute dangling\r\nhorns attached to the skin alone, and which are often shed and grow\r\nagain. With hornless goats, according to Desmarest,[84] the bony\r\nprotuberance which properly supports the horn exists as a mere\r\nrudiment.\r\n\r\nWith cultivated plants it is far from rare to find the petals, stamens,\r\nand pistils represented by rudiments, like those observed in natural\r\nspecies. So it is with the whole seed in many fruits; thus, near\r\nAstrakhan there is a grape with mere traces of seeds, “so small and\r\nlying so near the stalk that they are not perceived in eating the\r\ngrape.”[85] In certain varieties of the gourd, the tendrils, according\r\nto Naudin, are represented by rudiments or by various monstrous\r\ngrowths. In the broccoli and cauliflower the greater number of the\r\nflowers are incapable of expansion, and include rudimentary organs. In\r\nthe Feather hyacinth (_Muscari comosum_) in its natural state the upper\r\nand central flowers are brightly coloured but rudimentary; under\r\ncultivation the tendency to abortion travels downwards and outwards,\r\nand all the flowers become rudimentary; but the abortive stamens and\r\npistils are not so small in the lower as in the upper flowers. In the\r\n_Viburnum opulus,_ on the other hand, the outer flowers naturally have\r\ntheir organs of fructification in a rudimentary state, and the corolla\r\nis of large size; under cultivation, the change spreads to the centre,\r\nand all the flowers become affected. In the compositae, the so-called\r\ndoubling of the flowers consists in the greater development of the\r\ncorolla of the central florets, generally accompanied with some degree\r\nof sterility; and it has been observed[86] that the progressive\r\ndoubling invariably spreads from the circumference to the centre,—that\r\nis, from the ray florets, which so often include rudimentary organs, to\r\nthose of the disc. I may add, as bearing on this subject, that with\r\nAsters, seeds taken from the florets of the circumference have been\r\nfound to yield the greatest number of double flowers.[87] In the above\r\ncases we have a natural tendency in certain parts to be rudimentary,\r\nand this under culture spreads either to, or from, the axis of the\r\nplant. It deserves notice, as showing how the same laws govern the\r\nchanges which natural species and artificial varieties undergo, that in\r\nthe species of Carthamus, one of the Compositae, a tendency to the\r\nabortion of the pappus may be traced extending from the circumference\r\nto the centre of the disc as in the so-called doubling of the flowers\r\nin the members of the same family. Thus, according to A. de\r\nJussieu,[88] the abortion is only partial in _Carthamus creticus,_ but\r\nmore extended in _C. lanatus_; for in this species only two or three of\r\nthe central seeds are furnished with a pappus, the surrounding seeds\r\nbeing either quite naked or furnished with a few hairs; and lastly in\r\n_C. tinctorius,_ even the central seeds are destitute of pappus, and\r\nthe abortion is complete.\r\n\r\nWith animals and plants under domestication, when an organ disappears,\r\nleaving only a rudiment, the loss has generally been sudden, as with\r\nhornless and tailless breeds; and such cases may be ranked as inherited\r\nmonstrosities. But in some few cases the loss has been gradual, and has\r\nbeen effected partly by selection, as with the rudimentary combs and\r\nwattles of certain fowls. We have also seen that the wings of some\r\ndomesticated birds have been slightly reduced by disuse, and the great\r\nreduction of the wings in certain silk-moths, with mere rudiments left,\r\nhas probably been aided by disuse.\r\n\r\nWith species in a state of nature, rudimentary organs are extremely\r\ncommon. Such organs are generally variable, as several naturalists have\r\nobserved; for, being useless, they are not regulated by natural\r\nselection, and they are more or less liable to reversion. The same rule\r\ncertainly holds good with parts which have become rudimentary under\r\ndomestication. We do not know through what steps under nature\r\nrudimentary organs have passed in being reduced to their present\r\ncondition; but we so incessantly see in species of the same group the\r\nfinest gradations between an organ in a rudimentary and perfect state,\r\nthat we are led to believe that the passage must have been extremely\r\ngradual. It may be doubted whether a change of structure so abrupt as\r\nthe sudden loss of an organ would ever be of service to a species in a\r\nstate of nature; for the conditions to which all organisms are closely\r\nadapted usually change very slowly. Even if an organ did suddenly\r\ndisappear in some one individual by an arrest of development,\r\nintercrossing with the other individuals of the same species would tend\r\nto cause its partial reappearance; so that its final reduction could\r\nonly be effected by some other means. The most probable view is, that a\r\npart which is now rudimentary, was formerly, owing to changed habits of\r\nlife, used less and less, being at the same time reduced in size by\r\ndisuse, until at last it became quite useless and superfluous. But as\r\nmost parts or organs are not brought into action during an early period\r\nof life, disuse or decreased action will not lead to their reduction\r\nuntil the organism arrives at a somewhat advanced age; and from the\r\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages the reduction will be\r\ntransmitted to the offspring at the same advanced stage of growth. The\r\npart or organ will thus retain its full size in the embryo, as we know\r\nto be the case with most rudiments. As soon as a part becomes useless,\r\nanother principle, that of economy of growth, will come into play, as\r\nit would be an advantage to an organism exposed to severe competition\r\nto save the development of any useless part; and individuals having the\r\npart less developed will have a slight advantage over others. But, as\r\nMr. Mivart has justly remarked, as soon as a part is much reduced, the\r\nsaving from its further reduction will be utterly insignificant; so\r\nthat this cannot be effected by natural selection. This manifestly\r\nholds good if the part be formed of mere cellular tissue, entailing\r\nlittle expenditure of nutriment. How then can the further reduction of\r\nan already somewhat reduced part be effected? That this has occurred\r\nrepeatedly under Nature is shown by the many gradations which exist\r\nbetween organs in a perfect state and the merest vestiges of them. Mr.\r\nRomanes[89] has, I think, thrown much light on this difficult problem.\r\nHis view, as far as it can be given in a few words, is as follows: all\r\nparts are somewhat variable and fluctuate in size round an average\r\npoint. Now, when a part has already begun from any cause to decrease,\r\nit is very improbable that the variations should be as great in the\r\ndirection of increase as of diminution; for the previous reduction\r\nshows that circumstances have not been favourable for its development;\r\nwhilst there is nothing to check variations in the opposite direction.\r\nIf this be so, the long continued crossing of many individuals\r\nfurnished with an organ which fluctuates in a greater degree towards\r\ndecrease than towards increase, will slowly but steadily lead to its\r\ndiminution. With respect to the complete and absolute abortion of a\r\npart, a distinct principle, which will be discussed in the chapter on\r\npangenesis, probably comes into action.\r\n\r\nWith animals and plants reared by man there is no severe or recurrent\r\nstruggle for existence, and the principle of economy will not come into\r\naction, so that the reduction of an organ will not thus be aided. So\r\nfar, indeed, is this from being the case, that in some few instances\r\norgans, which are naturally rudimentary in the parent-species, become\r\npartially redeveloped in the domesticated descendants. Thus cows, like\r\nmost other ruminants, properly have four active and two rudimentary\r\nmamma; but in our domesticated animals, the latter occasionally become\r\nconsiderably developed and yield milk. The atrophied mammae, which, in\r\nmale domesticated animals, including man, have in some rare cases grown\r\nto full size and secreted milk, perhaps offer an analogous case. The\r\nhind feet of dogs naturally include rudiments of a fifth toe, and in\r\ncertain large breeds these toes, though still rudimentary, become\r\nconsiderably developed and are furnished with claws. In the common Hen,\r\nthe spurs and comb are rudimentary, but in certain breeds these become,\r\nindependently of age or disease of the ovaria, well developed. The\r\nstallion has canine teeth, but the mare has only traces of the alveoli,\r\nwhich, as I am informed by the eminent veterinarian Mr. G. T. Brown,\r\nfrequently contain minute irregular nodules of bone. These nodules,\r\nhowever, sometimes become developed into imperfect teeth, protruding\r\nthrough the gums and coated with enamel; and occasionally they grow to\r\na fourth or even a third of the length of the canines in the stallion.\r\nWith plants I do not know whether the redevelopment of rudimentary\r\norgans occurs more frequently under culture than under nature. Perhaps\r\nthe pear-tree may be a case in point, for when wild it bears thorns,\r\nwhich consist of branches in a rudimentary condition and serve as a\r\nprotection, but, when the tree is cultivated, they are reconverted into\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘An Essay on Generation,’ Eng. translat., p. 18; p.t, ‘Lectures on\r\n Surgical Pathology,’ 1853, vol. i. p. 209.\r\n\r\n [2] ‘An Essay on Animal Reproduction,’ Eng. translat., 1769, p. 79.\r\n\r\n [3] Carpenter’s ‘Principles of Comp.

LAWS OF VARIATION, _continued._—CORRELATED VARIABILITY.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF TERM CORRELATION—CONNECTED WITH\r\nDEVELOPMENT—MODIFICATIONS CORRELATED WITH THE INCREASED OR DECREASED\r\nSIZE OF PARTS—CORRELATED VARIATION OF HOMOLOGOUS PARTS—FEATHERED FEET\r\nIN BIRDS ASSUMING THE STRUCTURE OF THE WINGS—CORRELATION BETWEEN THE\r\nHEAD AND THE EXTREMITIES—BETWEEN THE SKIN AND DERMAL APPENDAGES—BETWEEN\r\nTHE ORGANS OF SIGHT AND HEARING—CORRELATED MODIFICATIONS IN THE ORGANS\r\nOF PLANTS—CORRELATED MONSTROSITIES—CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SKULL AND\r\nEARS—SKULL AND CREST OF FEATHERS—SKULL AND HORNS—CORRELATION OF GROWTH\r\nCOMPLICATED BY THE ACCUMULATED EFFECTS OF NATURAL SELECTION—COLOUR AS\r\nCORRELATED WITH CONSTITUTIONAL PECULIARITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll parts of the organisation are to a certain extent connected\r\ntogether; but the connection may be so slight that it hardly exists, as\r\nwith compound animals or the buds on the same tree. Even in the higher\r\nanimals various parts are not at all closely related; for one part may\r\nbe wholly suppressed or rendered monstrous without any other part of\r\nthe body being affected. But in some cases, when one part varies,\r\ncertain other parts always, or nearly always, simultaneously vary; they\r\nare then subject to the law of correlated variation. The whole body is\r\nadmirably co-ordinated for the peculiar habits of life of each organic\r\nbeing, and may be said, as the Duke of Argyll insists in his ‘Reign of\r\nLaw’ to be correlated for this purpose. Again, in large groups of\r\nanimals certain structures always co-exist: for instance, a peculiar\r\nform of stomach with teeth of peculiar form, and such structures may in\r\none sense be said to be correlated. But these cases have no necessary\r\nconnection with the law to be discussed in the present chapter; for we\r\ndo not know that the initial or primary variations of the several parts\r\nwere in any way related: slight modifications or individual differences\r\nmay have been preserved, first in one and then in another part, until\r\nthe final and perfectly co-adapted structure was acquired; but to this\r\nsubject I shall presently recur. Again, in many groups of animals the\r\nmales alone are furnished with weapons, or are ornamented with gay\r\ncolours; and these characters manifestly stand in some sort of\r\ncorrelation with the male reproductive organs, for when the latter are\r\ndestroyed these characters disappear. But it was shown in the twelfth\r\nchapter that the very same peculiarity may become attached at any age\r\nto either sex, and afterwards be exclusively transmitted to the same\r\nsex at a corresponding age. In these cases we have inheritance limited\r\nby both sex and age; but we have no reason for supposing that the\r\noriginal cause of the variation was necessarily connected with the\r\nreproductive organs, or with the age of the affected being.\r\n\r\nIn cases of true correlated variation, we are sometimes able to see the\r\nnature of the connection; but in most cases it is hidden from us, and\r\ncertainly differs in different cases. We can seldom say which of two\r\ncorrelated parts first varies, and induces a change in the other; or\r\nwhether the two are the effects of some common cause. Correlated\r\nvariation is an important subject for us; for when one part is modified\r\nthrough continued selection, either by man or under nature, other parts\r\nof the organisation will be unavoidably modified. From this correlation\r\nit apparently follows that with our domesticated animals and plants,\r\nvarieties rarely or never differ from one another by a single character\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest cases of correlation is that a modification which\r\narises during an early stage of growth tends to influence the\r\nsubsequent development of the same part, as well as of other and\r\nintimately connected parts. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire states[1]\r\nthat this may constantly be observed with monstrosities in the animal\r\nkingdom; and Moquin-Tandon[2] remarks, that, as with plants the axis\r\ncannot become monstrous without in some way affecting the organs\r\nsubsequently produced from it, so axial anomalies are almost always\r\naccompanied by deviations of structure in the appended parts. We shall\r\npresently see that with short-muzzled races of the dog certain\r\nhistological changes in the basal elements of the bones arrest their\r\ndevelopment and shorten them, and this affects the position of the\r\nsubsequently developed molar teeth. It is probable that certain\r\nmodifications in the larvæ of insects would affect the structure of the\r\nmature insects. But we must be careful not to extend this view too far,\r\nfor during the normal course of development, certain species pass\r\nthrough an extraordinary course of change, whilst other and closely\r\nallied species arrive at maturity with little change of structure.\r\n\r\nAnother simple case of correlation is that with the increased or\r\ndecreased dimensions of the whole body, or of any particular part,\r\ncertain organs are increased or diminished in number, or are otherwise\r\nmodified. Thus pigeon fanciers have gone on selecting pouters for\r\nlength of body, and we have seen that their vertebrae are generally\r\nincreased not only in size but in number, and their ribs in breadth.\r\nTumblers have been selected for their small bodies, and their ribs and\r\nprimary wing-feathers are generally lessened in number. Fantails have\r\nbeen selected for their large widely-expanded tails, with numerous\r\ntail-feathers, and the caudal vertebrae are increased in size and\r\nnumber. Carriers have been selected for length of beak, and their\r\ntongues have become longer, but not in strict accordance with the\r\nlength of beak. In this latter breed and in others having large feet,\r\nthe number of the scutellae on the toes is greater than in the breeds\r\nwith small feet. Many similar cases could be given. In Germany it has\r\nbeen observed that the period of gestation is longer in large than in\r\nsmall breeds of cattle. With our highly-improved breeds of all kinds,\r\nthe periods of maturity and of reproduction have advanced with respect\r\nto the age of the animal; and, in correspondence with this, the teeth\r\nare now developed earlier than formerly, so that, to the surprise of\r\nagriculturists, the ancient rules for judging of the age of an animal\r\nby the state of its teeth are no longer trustworthy.[3]\r\n\r\n_Correlated Variation of Homologous Parts._—Parts which are homologous\r\ntend to vary in the same manner; and this is what might have been\r\nexpected, for such parts are identical in form and structure during an\r\nearly period of embryonic development, and are exposed in the egg or\r\nwomb to similar conditions. The symmetry, in most kinds of animals, of\r\nthe corresponding or homologous organs on the right and left sides of\r\nthe body, is the simplest case in point; but this symmetry sometimes\r\nfails, as with rabbits having only one ear, or stags with one horn, or\r\nwith many-horned sheep which sometimes carry an additional horn on one\r\nside of their heads. With flowers which have regular corollas, all the\r\npetals generally vary in the same manner, as we see in the complicated\r\nand symmetrical pattern, on the flowers, for instance, of the Chinese\r\npink; but with irregular flowers, though the petals are of course\r\nhomologous, this symmetry often fails, as with the varieties of the\r\n_Antirrhinum_ or snapdragon, or that variety of the kidney-bean\r\n(_Phaseolus_) which has a white standard-petal.\r\n\r\nIn the Vertebrata the front and hind limbs are homologous, and they\r\ntend to vary in the same manner, as we see in long and short legged, or\r\nin thick and thin legged races of the horse and dog. Isidore\r\nGeoffroy[4] has remarked on the tendency of supernumerary digits in man\r\nto appear, not only on the right and left sides, but on the upper and\r\nlower extremities. Meckel has insisted[5] that, when the muscles of the\r\narm depart in number or arrangement from their proper type, they almost\r\nalways imitate those of the leg; and so conversely the varying muscles\r\nof the leg imitate the normal muscles of the arm.\r\n\r\nIn several distinct breeds of the pigeon and fowl, the legs and the two\r\nouter toes are heavily feathered, so that in the trumpeter pigeon they\r\nappear like little wings. In the feather-legged bantam the “boots” or\r\nfeathers, which grow from the outside of the leg and generally from the\r\ntwo outer toes, have, according to the excellent authority of Mr.\r\nHewitt,[6] been seen to exceed the wing-feathers in length, and in one\r\ncase were actually nine and a half inches long! As Mr. Blyth has\r\nremarked to me, these leg-feathers resemble the primary wing-feathers,\r\nand are totally unlike the fine down which naturally grows on the legs\r\nof some birds, such as grouse and owls. Hence it may be suspected that\r\nexcess of food has first given redundancy to the plumage, and then that\r\nthe law of homologous variation has led to the development of feathers\r\non the legs, in a position corresponding with those on the wing,\r\nnamely, on the outside of the tarsi and toes. I am strengthened in this\r\nbelief by the following curious case of correlation, which for a long\r\ntime seemed to me utterly inexplicable, namely, that in pigeons of any\r\nbreed, if the legs are feathered, the two outer toes are partially\r\nconnected by skin. These two outer toes correspond with our third and\r\nfourth toes.[7] Now, in the wing of the pigeon or of any other bird,\r\nthe first and fifth digits are aborted; the second is rudimentary and\r\ncarries the so-called “bastard-wing;” whilst the third and fourth\r\ndigits are completely united and enclosed by skin, together forming the\r\nextremity of the wing. So that in feather-footed pigeons, not only does\r\nthe exterior surface support a row of long feathers, like\r\nwing-feathers, but the very same digits which in the wing are\r\ncompletely united by skin become partially united by skin in the feet;\r\nand thus by the law of the correlated variation of homologous parts we\r\ncan understand the curious connection of feathered legs and membrane\r\nbetween the two outer toes.\r\n\r\nAndrew Knight[8] has remarked that the face or head and the limbs\r\nusually vary together in general proportions. Compare, for instance,\r\nthe limbs of a dray and race horse, or of a greyhound and mastiff. What\r\na monster a greyhound would appear with the head of a mastiff! The\r\nmodern bulldog, however, has fine limbs, but this is a\r\nrecently-selected character. From the measurements given in the sixth\r\nchapter, we see that in several breeds of the pigeon the length of the\r\nbeak and the size of the feet are correlated. The view which, as before\r\nexplained, seems the most probable is, that disuse in all cases tends\r\nto diminish the feet, the beak becoming at the same time shorter\r\nthrough correlation; but that in some few breeds in which length of\r\nbeak has been a selected point, the feet, notwithstanding disuse, have\r\nincreased in size through correlation. In the following case some kind\r\nof correlation is seen to exist between the feet and beak: several\r\nspecimens have been sent to Mr. Bartlett at different times, as hybrids\r\nbetween ducks and fowls, and I have seen one; these were, as might be\r\nexpected, ordinary ducks in a semi-monstrous condition, and in all of\r\nthem the swimming-web between the toes was quite deficient or much\r\nreduced, and in all the beak was narrow and ill-shaped.\r\n\r\nWith the increased length of the beak in pigeons, not only the tongue\r\nincreases in length, but likewise the orifice of the nostrils. But the\r\nincreased length of the orifice of the nostrils perhaps stands in\r\ncloser correlation with the development of the corrugated skin or\r\nwattle at the base of the beak, for when there is much wattle round the\r\neyes, the eyelids are greatly increased or even doubled in length.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently some correlation even in colour between the head\r\nand the extremities. Thus with horses a large white star or blaze on\r\nthe forehead is generally accompanied by white feet.[9] With white\r\nrabbits and cattle, dark marks often co-exist on the tips of the ears\r\nand on the feet. In black and tan dogs of different breeds,\r\ntan-coloured spots over the eyes and tan-coloured feet almost\r\ninvariably go together. These latter cases of connected colouring may\r\nbe due either to reversion or to analogous variation,—subjects to which\r\nI shall hereafter return,—but this does not necessarily determine the\r\nquestion of their original correlation. Mr. H. W. Jackson informs me\r\nthat he has observed many hundred white-footed cats, and he finds that\r\nall are more or less conspicuously marked with white on the front of\r\nthe neck or chest.\r\n\r\nThe lopping forwards and downwards of the immense ears of fancy rabbits\r\nseems partly due to the disuse of the muscles, and partly to the weight\r\nand length of the ears, which have been increased by selection during\r\nmany generations. Now, with the increased size and changed direction of\r\nthe ears not only has the bony auditory meatus become changed in\r\noutline, direction, and greatly in size, but the whole skull has been\r\nslightly modified. This could be clearly seen in “half-lops”—that is,\r\nin rabbits with only one ear lopping forward— for the opposite sides of\r\ntheir skulls were not strictly symmetrical. This seems to me a curious\r\ninstance of correlation, between hard bones and organs so soft and\r\nflexible, as well as so unimportant under a physiological point of\r\nview, as the external ears. The result no doubt is largely due to mere\r\nmechanical action, that is, to the weight of the ears, on the same\r\nprinciple that the skull of a human infant is easily modified by\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe skin and the appendages of hair, feathers, hoofs, horns, and teeth,\r\nare homologous over the whole body. Every one knows that the colour of\r\nthe skin and that of the hair usually vary together; so that Virgil\r\nadvises the shepherd to look whether the mouth and tongue of the ram\r\nare black, lest the lambs should not be purely white. The colour of the\r\nskin and hair, and the odour emitted by the glands of the skin, are\r\nsaid[10] to be connected, even in the same race of men. Generally the\r\nhair varies in the same way all over the body in length, fineness, and\r\ncurliness. The same rule holds good with feathers, as we see with the\r\nlaced and frizzled breeds both of fowls and pigeons. In the common cock\r\nthe feathers on the neck and loins are always of a particular shape,\r\ncalled hackles: now in the Polish breed, both sexes are characterised\r\nby a tuft of feathers on the head, and through correlation these\r\nfeathers in the male always assume the form of hackles. The wing and\r\ntail-feathers, though arising from parts not homologous, vary in length\r\ntogether; so that long or short winged pigeons generally have long or\r\nshort tails. The case of the Jacobin-pigeon is more curious, for the\r\nwing and tail feathers are remarkably long; and this apparently has\r\narisen in correlation with the elongated and reversed feathers on the\r\nback of the neck, which form the hood.\r\n\r\nThe hoofs and hair are homologous appendages; and a careful observer,\r\nnamely Azara,[11] states that in Paraguay horses of various colours are\r\noften born with their hair curled and twisted like that on the head of\r\na negro. This peculiarity is strongly inherited. But what is remarkable\r\nis that the hoofs of these horses “are absolutely like those of a\r\nmule.” The hair also of their manes and tails is invariably much\r\nshorter than usual, being only from four to twelve inches in length; so\r\nthat curliness and shortness of the hair are here, as with the negro,\r\napparently correlated.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the horns of sheep, Youatt[12] remarks that\r\n“multiplicity of horns is not found in any breed of much value; it is\r\ngenerally accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece.”\r\nSeveral tropical breeds of sheep which are clothed with hair instead of\r\nwool, have horns almost like those of a goat. Sturm[13] expressly\r\ndeclares that in different races the more the wool is curled the more\r\nthe horns are spirally twisted. We have seen in the third chapter,\r\nwhere other analogous facts have been given, that the parent of the\r\nMauchamp breed, so famous for its fleece, had peculiarly shaped horns.\r\nThe inhabitants of Angora assert[14] that “only the white goats which\r\nhave horns wear the fleece in the long curly locks that are so much\r\nadmired; those which are not horned having a comparatively close coat.”\r\nFrom these cases we may infer that the hair or wool and the horns tend\r\nto vary in a correlated manner.[15] Those who have tried hydropathy are\r\naware that the frequent application of cold water stimulates the skin;\r\nand whatever stimulates the skin tends to increase the growth of the\r\nhair, as is well shown in the abnormal growth of hair near old inflamed\r\nsurfaces. Now, Professor Low[16] is convinced that with the different\r\nraces of British cattle thick skin and long hair depend on the humidity\r\nof the climate which they inhabit. We can thus see how a humid climate\r\nmight act on the horns—in the first place directly on the skin and\r\nhair, and secondly by correlation on the horns. The presence or absence\r\nof horns, moreover, both in the case of sheep and cattle, acts, as will\r\npresently be shown, by some sort of correlation on the skull.\r\n\r\nWith respect to hair and teeth, Mr. Yarrell[17] found many of the teeth\r\ndeficient in three hairless “Egyptian dogs,” and in a hairless terrier.\r\nThe incisors, canines, and the premolars suffered most, but in one case\r\nall the teeth, except the large tubercular molar on each side, were\r\ndeficient. With man several striking cases have been recorded[18] of\r\ninherited baldness with inherited deficiency, either complete or\r\npartial, of the teeth. I may give an analogous case, communicated to me\r\nby Mr. W. Wedderburn, of a Hindoo family in Scinde, in which ten men,\r\nin the course of four generations, were furnished, in both jaws taken\r\ntogether, with only four small and weak incisor teeth and with eight\r\nposterior molars. The men thus affected have very little hair on the\r\nbody, and become bald early in life. They also suffer much during hot\r\nweather from excessive dryness of the skin. It is remarkable that no\r\ninstance has occurred of a daughter being thus affected; and this fact\r\nreminds us how much more liable men are in England to become bald than\r\nwomen. Though the daughters in the above family are never affected,\r\nthey transmit the tendency to their sons; and no case has occurred of a\r\nson transmitting it to his sons. The affection thus appears only in\r\nalternate generations, or after longer intervals. There is a similar\r\nconnection between hair and teeth, according to Mr. Sedgwick, in those\r\nrare cases in which the hair has been renewed in old age, for this has\r\n“usually been accompanied by a renewal of the teeth.” I have remarked\r\nin a former part of this volume that the great reduction in the size of\r\nthe tusks in domestic boars probably stands in close relation with\r\ntheir diminished bristles, due to a certain amount of protection; and\r\nthat the reappearance of the tusks in boars, which have become feral\r\nand are fully exposed to the weather, probably depends on the\r\nreappearance of the bristles. I may add, though not strictly connected\r\nwith our present point, that an agriculturist[19] asserts that “pigs\r\nwith little hair on their bodies are most liable to lose their tails,\r\nshowing a weakness of the tegumental structure. It may be prevented by\r\ncrossing with a more hairy breed.”\r\n\r\nIn the previous cases deficient hair, and teeth deficient in number or\r\nsize, are apparently connected. In the following cases abnormally\r\nredundant hair, and teeth either deficient or redundant, are likewise\r\nconnected. Mr. Crawfurd[20] saw at the Burmese Court a man, thirty\r\nyears old, with his whole body, except the hands and feet, covered with\r\nstraight silky hair, which on the shoulders and spine was five inches\r\nin length. At birth the ears alone were covered. He did not arrive at\r\npuberty, or shed his milk teeth, until twenty years old; and at this\r\nperiod he acquired five teeth in the upper jaw, namely, four incisors\r\nand one canine, and four incisor teeth in the lower jaw; all the teeth\r\nwere small. This man had a daughter who was born with hair within her\r\nears; and the hair soon extended over her body. When Captain Yule[21]\r\nvisited the Court, he found this girl grown up; and she presented a\r\nstrange appearance with even her nose densely covered with soft hair.\r\nLike her father, she was furnished with incisor teeth alone. The King\r\nhad with difficulty bribed a man to marry her, and of her two children,\r\none, a boy fourteen months old, had hair growing out of his ears, with\r\na beard and moustache. This strange peculiarity has, therefore, been\r\ninherited for three generations, with the molar teeth deficient in the\r\ngrandfather and mother; whether these teeth would likewise fail in the\r\ninfant could not then be told.\r\n\r\nA parallel case of a man fifty-five years old, and of his son, with\r\ntheir faces covered with hair, has recently occurred in Russia. Dr.\r\nAlex. Brandt has sent me an account of this case, together with\r\nspecimens of the extremely fine hair from the cheeks. The man is\r\ndeficient in teeth, possessing only four incisors in the lower and two\r\nin the upper jaw. His son, about three years old, has no teeth except\r\nfour lower incisors. The case, as Dr. Brandt remarks in his letter, no\r\ndoubt is due to an arrest of development in the hair and teeth. We here\r\nsee how independent of the ordinary conditions of existence such\r\narrests must be, for the lives of a Russian peasant and of a native of\r\nBurmah are as different as possible.[22]\r\n\r\nHere is another and somewhat different case communicated to me by Mr.\r\nWallace on the authority of Dr. Purland, a dentist: Julia Pastrana, a\r\nSpanish dancer, was a remarkably fine woman, but she had a thick\r\nmasculine beard and a hairy forehead; she was photographed, and her\r\nstuffed skin was exhibited as a show; but what concerns us is, that she\r\nhad in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth,\r\none row being placed within the other, of which Dr. Purland took a\r\ncast. From the redundancy of teeth her mouth projected, and her face\r\nhad a gorilla-like appearance. These cases and those of the hairless\r\ndogs forcibly call to mind the fact, that the two orders of\r\nmammals—namely, the Edentata and Cetacea—which are the most abnormal in\r\ntheir dermal covering, are likewise the most abnormal either by\r\ndeficiency or redundancy of teeth.\r\n\r\nThe organs of sight and hearing are generally admitted to be homologous\r\nwith one another and with various dermal appendages; hence these parts\r\nare liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction. Mr. White Cowper\r\nsays “that in all cases of double microphthalmia brought under his\r\nnotice he has at the same time met with defective development of the\r\ndental system.” Certain forms of blindness seem to be associated with\r\nthe colour of the hair; a man with black hair and a woman with\r\nlight-coloured hair, both of sound constitution, married and had nine\r\nchildren, all of whom were born blind; of these children, five “with\r\ndark hair and brown iris were afflicted with amaurosis; the four\r\nothers, with light-coloured hair and blue iris, had amaurosis and\r\ncataract conjoined.” Several cases could be given, showing that some\r\nrelation exists between various affections of the eyes and ears; thus\r\nLiebreich states that out of 241 deaf-mutes in Berlin, no less than\r\nfourteen suffered from the rare disease called pigmentary retinitis.\r\nMr. White Cowper and Dr. Earle have remarked that inability to\r\ndistinguish different colours, or colour-blindness, “is often\r\nassociated with a corresponding inability to distinguish musical\r\nsounds.”[23]\r\n\r\nHere is a more curious case: white cats, if they have blue eyes, are\r\nalmost always deaf. I formerly thought that the rule was invariable,\r\nbut I have heard of a few authentic exceptions. The first two notices\r\nwere published in 1829 and relate to English and Persian cats: of the\r\nlatter, the Rev. W. T. Bree possessed a female, and he states, “that of\r\nthe offspring produced at one and the same birth, such as, like the\r\nmother, were entirely white (with blue eyes) were, like her, invariably\r\ndeaf; while those that had the least speck of colour on their fur, as\r\ninvariably possessed the usual faculty of hearing.”[24] The Rev. W.\r\nDarwin Fox informs me that he has seen more than a dozen instances of\r\nthis correlation in English, Persian, and Danish cats; but he adds\r\n“that, if one eye, as I have several times observed, be not blue, the\r\ncat hears. On the other hand, I have never seen a white cat with eyes\r\nof the common colour that was deaf.” In France Dr. Sichel[25] has\r\nobserved during twenty years similar facts; he adds the remarkable case\r\nof the iris beginning, at the end of four months, to grow\r\ndark-coloured, and then the cat first began to hear.\r\n\r\nThis case of correlation in cats has struck many persons as marvellous.\r\nThere is nothing unusual in the relation between blue eyes and white\r\nfur; and we have already seen that the organs of sight and hearing are\r\noften simultaneously affected. In the present instance the cause\r\nprobably lies in a slight arrest of development in the nervous system\r\nin connection with the sense-organs. Kittens during the first nine\r\ndays, whilst their eyes are closed, appear to be completely deaf; I\r\nhave made a great clanging noise with a poker and shovel close to their\r\nheads, both when they were asleep and awake, without producing any\r\neffect. The trial must not be made by shouting close to their ears, for\r\nthey are, even when asleep, extremely sensitive to a breath of air.\r\nNow, as long as the eyes continue closed, the iris is no doubt blue,\r\nfor in all the kittens which I have seen this colour remains for some\r\ntime after the eyelids open. Hence, if we suppose the development of\r\nthe organs of sight and hearing to be arrested at the stage of the\r\nclosed eyelids, the eyes would remain permanently blue and the ears\r\nwould be incapable of perceiving sound; and we should thus understand\r\nthis curious case. As, however, the colour of the fur is determined\r\nlong before birth, and as the blueness of the eyes and the whiteness of\r\nthe fur are obviously connected, we must believe that some primary\r\ncause acts at a much earlier period.\r\n\r\nThe instances of correlated variability hitherto given have been\r\nchiefly drawn from the animal kingdom, and we will now turn to plants.\r\nLeaves, sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils are all homologous. In\r\ndouble flowers we see that the stamens and pistils vary in the same\r\nmanner, and assume the form and colour of the petals. In the double\r\ncolumbine (_Aquilegia vulgaris_), the successive whorls of stamens are\r\nconverted into cornucopias, which are enclosed within one another and\r\nresemble the true petals. In hose-in-hose flowers the sepals mock the\r\npetals. In some cases the flowers and leaves vary together in tint: in\r\nall the varieties of the common pea, which have purple flowers, a\r\npurple mark may be seen on the stipules.\r\n\r\nM. Faivre states that with the varieties of _ Primula sinensis_ the\r\ncolour of the flower is evidently correlated with the colour of the\r\nunder side of the leaves; and he adds that the varieties with\r\nfimbriated flowers almost always have voluminous, balloon-like\r\ncalyces.[26] With other plants the leaves and fruit or seeds vary\r\ntogether in colour, as in a curious pale-leaved variety of the\r\nsycamore, which has recently been described in France,[27] and as in\r\nthe purple-leaved hazel, in which the leaves, the husk of the nut, and\r\nthe pellicle round the kernel are all coloured purple.[28] Pomologists\r\ncan predict to a certain extent, from the size and appearance of the\r\nleaves of their seedlings, the probable nature of the fruit; for, as\r\nVan Mons remarks[29] variations in the leaves are generally accompanied\r\nby some modification in the flower, and consequently in the fruit. In\r\nthe Serpent melon, which has a narrow tortuous fruit above a yard in\r\nlength, the stem of the plant, the peduncle of the female flower, and\r\nthe middle lobe of the leaf, are all elongated in a remarkable manner.\r\nOn the other hand, several varieties of Cucurbita, which have dwarfed\r\nstems, all produce, as Naudin remarks, leaves of the same peculiar\r\nshape. Mr. G. Maw informs me that all the varieties of the scarlet\r\nPelargoniums which have contracted or imperfect leaves have contracted\r\nflowers: the difference between “Brilliant” and its parent “Tom Thumb”\r\nis a good instance of this. It may be suspected that the curious case\r\ndescribed by Risso,[30] of a variety of the Orange which produces on\r\nthe young shoots rounded leaves with winged petioles, and afterwards\r\nelongated leaves on long but wingless petioles, is connected with the\r\nremarkable change in form and nature which the fruit undergoes during\r\nits development.\r\n\r\nIn the following instance we have the colour and the form of the petals\r\napparently correlated, and both dependent on the nature of the season.\r\nAn observer, skilled in the subject, writes,[31] “I noticed, during the\r\nyear 1842, that every Dahlia of which the colour had any tendency to\r\nscarlet, was deeply notched—indeed, to so great an extent as to give\r\nthe petals the appearance of a saw; the indentures were, in some\r\ninstances, more than a quarter of an inch deep.” Again, Dahlias which\r\nhave their petals tipped with a different colour from the rest of the\r\nflower are very inconstant, and during certain years some, or even all\r\nthe flowers, become uniformly coloured; and it has been observed with\r\nseveral varieties[32] that when this happens the petals grow much\r\nelongated and lose their proper shape. This, however, may be due to\r\nreversion, both in colour and form, to the aboriginal species.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion on correlation, we have hitherto treated of cases in\r\nwhich we can partly understand the bond of connection; but I will now\r\ngive cases in which we cannot even conjecture, or can only very\r\nobscurely see, the nature of the bond. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,\r\nin his work on Monstrosities, insists,[33] “que certaines anomalies\r\ncoexistent rarement entr’elles, d’autres fréquemment, d’autres enfin\r\npresque constamment, malgré la différence très-grande de leur nature,\r\net quoiqu’elles puissent paraître _complètement indépendantes_ les unes\r\ndes autres.” We see something analogous in certain diseases: thus in a\r\nrare affection of the renal capsules (of which the functions are\r\nunknown), the skin becomes bronzed; and in hereditary syphilis, as I\r\nhear from Sir J. Paget, both the milk and the second teeth assume a\r\npeculiar and characteristic form. Professor Rolleston, also, informs me\r\nthat the incisor teeth are sometimes furnished with a vascular rim in\r\ncorrelation with intra-pulmonary deposition of tubercles. In other\r\ncases of phthisis and of cyanosis the nails and finger-ends become\r\nclubbed like acorns. I believe that no explanation has been offered of\r\nthese and of many other cases of correlated disease.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more curious and less intelligible than the fact previously\r\ngiven, on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, that young pigeons of all\r\nbreeds, which when mature have white, yellow, silver-blue, or\r\ndun-coloured plumage, come out of the egg almost naked; whereas pigeons\r\nof other colours when first born are clothed with plenty of down? White\r\nPea-fowls, as has been observed both in England and France,[34] and as\r\nI have myself seen, are inferior in size to the common coloured kind;\r\nand this cannot be accounted for by the belief that albinism is always\r\naccompanied by constitutional weakness; for white or albino moles are\r\ngenerally larger than the common kind.\r\n\r\nTo turn to more important characters: the niata cattle of the Pampas\r\nare remarkable from their short foreheads, upturned muzzles, and curved\r\nlower jaws. In the skull the nasal and premaxillary bones are much\r\nshortened, the maxillaries are excluded from any junction with the\r\nnasals, and all the bones are slightly modified, even to the plane of\r\nthe occiput. From the analogous case of the dog, hereafter to be given,\r\nit is probable that the shortening of the nasal and adjoining bones is\r\nthe proximate cause of the other modifications in the skull, including\r\nthe upward curvature of the lower jaw, though we cannot follow out the\r\nsteps by which these changes have been effected.\r\n\r\nPolish fowls have a large tuft of feathers on their heads; and their\r\nskulls are perforated by numerous holes, so that a pin can be driven\r\ninto the brain without touching any bone. That this deficiency of bone\r\nis in some way connected with the tuft of feathers is clear from tufted\r\nducks and geese likewise having perforated skulls. The case would\r\nprobably be considered by some authors as one of balancement or\r\ncompensation. In the chapter on Fowls, I have shown that with Polish\r\nfowls the tuft of feathers was probably at first small; by continued\r\nselection it became larger, and then rested on a fibrous mass; and\r\nfinally, as it became still larger, the skull itself became more and\r\nmore protuberant until it acquired its present extraordinary structure.\r\nThrough correlation with the protuberance of the skull, the shape and\r\neven the relative connection of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the\r\nshape of the orifice of the nostrils, the breadth of the frontal bone,\r\nthe shape of the post-lateral processes of the frontal and squamosal\r\nbones, and the direction of the bony cavity of the ear, have all been\r\nmodified. The internal configuration of the skull and the whole shape\r\nof the brain have likewise been altered in a truly marvellous manner.\r\n\r\nAfter this case of the Polish fowl it would be superfluous to do more\r\nthan refer to the details previously given on the manner in which the\r\nchanged form of the comb has affected the skull, in various breeds of\r\nthe fowl, causing by correlation crests, protuberances, and depressions\r\non its surface.\r\n\r\nWith our cattle and sheep the horns stand in close connection with the\r\nsize of the skull, and with the shape of the frontal bones; thus\r\nCline[35] found that the skull of a horned ram weighed five times as\r\nmuch as that of a hornless ram of the same age. When cattle become\r\nhornless, the frontal bones are “materially diminished in breadth\r\ntowards the poll;” and the cavities between the bony plates “are not so\r\ndeep, nor do they extend beyond the frontals.”[36] It may be well here\r\nto pause and observe how the effects of correlated variability, of the\r\nincreased use of parts, and of the accumulation of so-called\r\nspontaneous variations through natural selection, are in many cases\r\ninextricably commingled. We may borrow an illustration from Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer, who remarks that, when the Irish elk acquired its gigantic\r\nhorns, weighing above one hundred pounds, numerous co-ordinated changes\r\nof structure would have been indispensable,—namely, a thickened skull\r\nto carry the horns; strengthened cervical vertebrae, with strengthened\r\nligaments; enlarged dorsal vertebrae to support the neck, with powerful\r\nfore-legs and feet; all these parts being supplied with proper muscles,\r\nblood-vessels, and nerves. How then could these admirably co-ordinated\r\nmodifications of structure have been acquired? According to the\r\ndoctrine which I maintain, the horns of the male elk were slowly gained\r\nthrough sexual selection,—that is, by the best-armed males conquering\r\nthe worse-armed, and leaving a greater number of descendants. But it is\r\nnot at all necessary that the several parts of the body should have\r\nsimultaneously varied. Each stag presents individual characteristics,\r\nand in the same district those which had slightly heavier horns, or\r\nstronger necks, or stronger bodies, or were the most courageous, would\r\nsecure the greater number of does, and consequently have a greater\r\nnumber of offspring. The offspring would inherit, in a greater or less\r\ndegree, these same qualities, would occasionally intercross with one\r\nanother, or with other individuals varying in some favourable manner;\r\nand of their offspring, those which were the best endowed in any\r\nrespect would continue multiplying; and so onwards, always progressing,\r\nsometimes in one direction, and sometimes in another, towards the\r\nexcellently co-ordinated structure of the male elk. To make this clear,\r\nlet us reflect on the probable steps, as shown in the twentieth\r\nchapter, by which our race and dray horses have arrived at their\r\npresent state of excellence; if we could view the whole series of\r\nintermediate forms between one of these animals and an early unimproved\r\nprogenitor, we should behold a vast number of animals, not equally\r\nimproved in each generation throughout their entire structure, but\r\nsometimes a little more in one point, and sometimes in another, yet on\r\nthe whole gradually approaching in character to our present race or\r\ndray horses, which are so admirably fitted in the one case for\r\nfleetness and in the other for draught.\r\n\r\nAlthough natural selection would thus[37] tend to give to the male elk\r\nits present structure, yet it is probable that the inherited effects of\r\nuse, and of the mutual action of part on part, have been equally or\r\nmore important. As the horns gradually increased in weight the muscles\r\nof the neck, with the bones to which they are attached, would increase\r\nin size and strength; and these parts would react on the body and legs.\r\nNor must we overlook the fact that certain parts of the skull and the\r\nextremities would, judging by analogy, tend from the first to vary in a\r\ncorrelated manner. The increased weight of the horns would also act\r\ndirectly on the skull, in the same manner as when one bone is removed\r\nin the leg of a dog, the other bone, which has to carry the whole\r\nweight of the body, increases in thickness. But from the fact given\r\nwith respect to horned and hornless cattle, it is probable that the\r\nhorns and skull would immediately act on each other through the\r\nprinciple of correlation. Lastly, the growth and subsequent wear and\r\ntear of the augmented muscles and bones would require an increased\r\nsupply of blood, and consequently increased supply of food; and this\r\nagain would require increased powers of mastication, digestion,\r\nrespiration, and excretion.\r\n\r\n      _Colour as Correlated with Constitutional Peculiarities._\r\n\r\nIt is an old belief that with man there is a connection between\r\ncomplexions and constitution; and I find that some of the best\r\nauthorities believe in this to the present day.[38] Thus Dr. Beddoe by\r\nhis tables shows[39] that a relation exists between liability to\r\nconsumption and the colour of the hair, eyes, and skin. It has been\r\naffirmed[40] that, in the French army which invaded Russia, soldiers\r\nhaving a dark complexion from the southern parts of Europe, withstood\r\nthe intense cold better than those with lighter complexions from the\r\nnorth; but no doubt such statements are liable to error.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter on Selection I have given several cases proving\r\nthat with animals and plants differences in colour are correlated with\r\nconstitutional differences, as shown by greater or less immunity from\r\ncertain diseases, from the attacks of parasitic plants and animals,\r\nfrom scorching by the sun, and from the action of certain poisons. When\r\nall the individuals of any one variety possess an immunity of this\r\nnature, we do not know that it stands in any sort of correlation with\r\ntheir colour; but when several similarly coloured varieties of the same\r\nspecies are thus characterised, whilst other coloured varieties are not\r\nthus favoured, we must believe in the existence of a correlation of\r\nthis kind. Thus, in the United States purple-fruited plums of many\r\nkinds are far more affected by a certain disease than green or\r\nyellow-fruited varieties. On the other hand, yellow-fleshed peaches of\r\nvarious kinds suffer from another disease much more than the\r\nwhite-fleshed varieties. In the Mauritius red sugar-canes are much less\r\naffected by a particular disease than the white canes. White onions and\r\nverbenas are the most liable to mildew; and in Spain the green-fruited\r\ngrapes suffered from the vine-disease more than other coloured\r\nvarieties. Dark-coloured pelargoniums and verbenas are more scorched by\r\nthe sun than varieties of other colours. Red wheats are believed to be\r\nhardier than white; and red-flowered hyacinths were more injured during\r\none particular winter in Holland than other coloured varieties. With\r\nanimals, white terriers suffer most from the distemper, white chickens\r\nfrom a parasitic worm in their tracheae, white pigs from scorching by\r\nthe sun, and white cattle from flies; but the caterpillars of the\r\nsilk-moth which yield white cocoons suffered in France less from the\r\ndeadly parasitic fungus than those producing yellow silk.\r\n\r\nThe cases of immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons, in\r\nconnexion with colour, are more interesting, and are at present wholly\r\ninexplicable. I have already given a remarkable instance, on the\r\nauthority of Professor Wyman, of all the hogs, excepting those of a\r\nblack colour, suffering severely in Virginia from eating the root of\r\nthe _Lachnanthes tinctoria._ According to Spinola and others,[41]\r\nbuckwheat (_Po1ygonum fagopyrum_), when in flower, is highly injurious\r\nto white or white-spotted pigs, if they are exposed to the heat of the\r\nsun, but is quite innocuous to black pigs. According to two accounts,\r\nthe _Hypericum crispum_ in Sicily is poisonous to white sheep alone;\r\ntheir heads swell, their wool falls off, and they often die; but this\r\nplant, according to Lecce, is poisonous only when it grows in swamps;\r\nnor is this improbable, as we know how readily the poisonous principle\r\nin plants is influenced by the conditions under which they grow.\r\n\r\nThree accounts have been published in Eastern Prussia, of white and\r\nwhite-spotted horses being greatly injured by eating mildewed and\r\nhoneydewed vetches; every spot of skin bearing white hairs becoming\r\ninflamed and gangrenous. The Rev. J. Rodwell informs me that his father\r\nturned out about fifteen cart-horses into a field of tares which in\r\nparts swarmed with black aphides, and which no doubt were honeydewed,\r\nand probably mildewed; the horses, with two exceptions, were chestnuts\r\nand bays with white marks on their faces and pasterns, and the white\r\nparts alone swelled and became angry scabs. The two bay horses with no\r\nwhite marks entirely escaped all injury. In Guernsey, when horses eat\r\nfool’s parsley (_Æthusa cynapium_) they are sometimes violently purged;\r\nand this plant “has a peculiar effect on the nose and lips, causing\r\ndeep cracks and ulcers, particularly on horses with white muzzles.”[42]\r\nWith cattle, independently of the action of any poison, cases have been\r\npublished by Youatt and Erdt of cutaneous diseases with much\r\nconstitutional disturbance (in one instance after exposure to a hot\r\nsun) affecting every single point which bore a white hair, but\r\ncompletely passing over other parts of the body. Similar cases have\r\nbeen observed with horses.[43]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that not only do those parts of the skin which bear white\r\nhair differ in a remarkable manner from those bearing hair of any other\r\ncolour, but that some great constitutional difference must be\r\ncorrelated with the colour of the hair; for in the above-mentioned\r\ncases, vegetable poisons caused fever, swelling of the head, as well as\r\nother symptoms, and even death, to all the white, or white-spotted\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Hist. des Anomalies,’ tom. iii. p. 392.

LAWS OF VARIATION, _continued._—SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nTHE FUSION OF HOMOLOGOUS PARTS—THE VARIABILITY OF MULTIPLE AND\r\nHOMOLOGOUS PARTS—COMPENSATION OF GROWTH—MECHANICAL PRESSURE—RELATIVE\r\nPOSITION OF FLOWERS WITH RESPECT TO THE AXIS, AND OF SEEDS IN THE\r\nOVARY, AS INDUCING VARIATION—ANALOGOUS OR PARALLEL VARIETIES—SUMMARY OF\r\nTHE THREE LAST CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fusion of Homologous Parts._—Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire formerly\r\npropounded what he called _la loi de l’affinité de soi pour soi,_ which\r\nhas been discussed and illustrated by his son, Isidore, with respect to\r\nmonsters in the animal kingdom,[1] and by Moquin-Tandon, with respect\r\nto monstrous plants. This law seems to imply that homologous parts\r\nactually attract one another and then unite. No doubt there are many\r\nwonderful cases, in which such parts become intimately fused together.\r\nThis is perhaps best seen in monsters with two heads, which are united,\r\nsummit to summit, or face to face, or Janus-like, back to back, or\r\nobliquely side to side. In one instance of two heads united almost face\r\nto face, but a little obliquely, four ears were developed, and on one\r\nside a perfect face, which was manifestly formed by the fusion of two\r\nhalf-faces. Whenever two bodies or two heads are united, each bone,\r\nmuscle, vessel, and nerve on the line of junction appears as if it had\r\nsought out its fellow, and had become completely fused with it.\r\nLereboullet,[2] who carefully studied the development of double\r\nmonsters in fishes, observed in fifteen instances the steps by which\r\ntwo heads gradually became united into one. In all such cases it is now\r\nthought by the greater number of capable judges that the homologous\r\nparts do not attract each other, but that in the words of Mr. Lowne:[3]\r\n“As union takes place before the differentiation of distinct organs\r\noccurs, these are formed in continuity with each other.” He adds that\r\norgans already differentiated probably in no case become united to\r\nhomologous ones. M. Dareste does not speak[4] quite decisively against\r\nthe law of _soi pour soi,_ but concludes by saying, “On se rend\r\nparfaitement compte de la formation des monstres, si l’on admet que les\r\nembryons qui se soudent appartiennent à un même œuf; qu’ils s’unissent\r\nen même temps qu’ils se forment, et que la soudure ne se produit que\r\npendant la première période de la vie embryonnaire, celle ou les\r\norganes ne sont encore constitués que par des blastèmes homogènes.”\r\n\r\nBy whatever means the abnormal fusion of homologous parts is effected,\r\nsuch cases throw light on the frequent presence of organs which are\r\ndouble during an embryonic period (and throughout life in other and\r\nlower members of the same class) but which afterwards unite by a normal\r\nprocess into a single medial organ. In the vegetable kingdom\r\nMoquin-Tandon[5] gives a long list of cases, showing how frequently\r\nhomologous parts, such as leaves, petals, stamens, and pistils,\r\nflowers, and aggregates of homologous parts, such as buds, as well as\r\nfruit, become blended, both normally and abnormally, with perfect\r\nsymmetry into one another.\r\n\r\n_The Variability of Multiple and Homologous parts._—Isidore Geoffroy[6]\r\ninsists that, when any part or organ is repeated many times in the same\r\nanimal, it is particularly liable to vary both in number and structure.\r\nWith respect to number, the proposition may, I think, be considered as\r\nfully established; but the evidence is chiefly derived from organic\r\nbeings living under their natural conditions, with which we are not\r\nhere concerned. Whenever such parts as the vertebrae or teeth, the rays\r\nin the fins of fishes, or the feathers in the tails of birds, or\r\npetals, stamens, pistils, or seeds, are very numerous, the number is\r\ngenerally variable. With respect to the structure of multiple parts,\r\nthe evidence of variability is not so decisive; but the fact, as far as\r\nit may be trusted, probably depends on multiple parts being of less\r\nphysiological importance than single parts; consequently their\r\nstructure has been less rigorously guarded by natural selection.\r\n\r\n_Compensation of Growth, or Balancement._—This law, as applied to\r\nnatural species, was propounded by Goethe and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire at\r\nnearly the same time. It implies that, when much organised matter is\r\nused in building up some one part, other parts are starved and become\r\nreduced. Several authors, especially botanists, believe in this law;\r\nothers reject it. As far as I can judge, it occasionally holds good;\r\nbut its importance has probably been exaggerated. It is scarcely\r\npossible to distinguish between the supposed effects of such\r\ncompensation, and the effects of long-continued selection which may\r\nlead to the augmentation of one part, and simultaneously to the\r\ndiminution of another. Anyhow, there can be no doubt that an organ may\r\nbe greatly increased without any corresponding diminution of an\r\nadjoining part. To recur to our former illustration of the Irish elk,\r\nit may be asked what part has suffered in consequence of the immense\r\ndevelopment of the horns?\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that the struggle for existence does not\r\nbear hard on our domesticated productions, and consequently the\r\nprinciple of economy of growth will seldom come into play, so that we\r\nought not to expect to find with them frequent evidence of\r\ncompensation. We have, however, some such cases. Moquin-Tandon\r\ndescribes a monstrous bean,[7] in which the stipules were enormously\r\ndeveloped, and the leaflets apparently in consequence completely\r\naborted; this case is interesting, as it represents the natural\r\ncondition of _Lathyrus aphaca,_ with its stipules of great size, and\r\nits leaves reduced to mere threads, which act as tendrils. De\r\nCandolle[8] has remarked that the varieties of _Raphanus sativus_ which\r\nhave small roots yield numerous seed containing much oil, whilst those\r\nwith large roots are not productive in oil; and so it is with _Brassica\r\nasperifolia._ The varieties of _Cucurbita pepo_ which bear large fruit\r\nyield a small crop, according to Naudin; whilst those producing small\r\nfruit yield a vast number. Lastly, I have endeavoured to show in the\r\neighteenth chapter that with many cultivated plants unnatural treatment\r\nchecks the full and proper action of the reproductive organs, and they\r\nare thus rendered more or less sterile; consequently, in the way of\r\ncompensation, the fruit becomes greatly enlarged, and, in double\r\nflowers, the petals are greatly increased in number.\r\n\r\nWith animals, it has been found difficult to produce cows which yield\r\nmuch milk, and are afterwards capable of fattening well. With fowls\r\nwhich have large top-knots and beards the comb and wattles are\r\ngenerally much reduced in size; though there are exceptions to this\r\nrule. Perhaps the entire absence of the oil-gland in fantail pigeons\r\nmay be connected with the great development of their tails.\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Pressure as a Cause of Modifications._—In some few cases\r\nthere is reason to believe that mere mechanical pressure has affected\r\ncertain structures. Vrolik and Weber[9] maintain that the shape of the\r\nhuman head is influenced by the shape of the mother’s pelvis. The\r\nkidneys in different birds differ much in form, and St. Ange[10]\r\nbelieves that this is determined by the form of the pelvis, which\r\nagain, no doubt, stands in close relation with their power of\r\nlocomotion. In snakes, the viscera are curiously displaced, in\r\ncomparison with their position in other vertebrates; and this has been\r\nattributed by some authors to the elongation of their bodies; but here,\r\nas in so many previous cases, it is impossible to disentangle a direct\r\nresult of this kind from that consequent on natural selection. Godron\r\nhas argued[11] that the abortion of the spur on the inner side of the\r\nflowers in Corydalis, is caused by the buds at a very early period of\r\ngrowth whilst underground being closely pressed against one another and\r\nagainst the stem. Some botanists believe that the singular difference\r\nin the shape both of the seed and corolla, in the interior and exterior\r\nflorets in certain Compositous and Umbelliferous plants, is due to the\r\npressure to which the inner florets are subjected; but this conclusion\r\nis doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe facts just given do not relate to domesticated productions, and\r\ntherefore do not strictly concern us. But here is a more appropriate\r\ncase: H. Müller[12] has shown that in shortfaced races of the dog some\r\nof the molar teeth are placed in a slightly different position to that\r\nwhich they occupy in other dogs, especially in those having elongated\r\nmuzzles; and as he remarks, any inherited change in the arrangement of\r\nthe teeth deserves notice, considering their classificatory importance.\r\nThis difference in position is due to the shortening of certain facial\r\nbones and the consequent want of space; and the shortening results from\r\na peculiar and abnormal state of the embryonal cartilages of the bones.\r\n\r\n      _Relative Position of Flowers with respect to the Axis, and of\r\n      Seeds in the Ovary, as inducing Variation._\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth chapter various peloric flowers were described, and\r\ntheir production was shown to be due either to arrested development, or\r\nto reversion to a primordial condition. Moquin-Tandon has remarked that\r\nthe flowers which stand on the summit of the main stem or of a lateral\r\nbranch are more liable to become peloric than those on the sides;[13]\r\nand he adduces, amongst other instances, that of _Teucrium\r\ncampanulatum._ In another Labiate plant grown by me, viz., the\r\n_Galeobdolon luteum,_ the peloric flowers were always produced on the\r\nsummit of the stem, where flowers are not usually borne. In\r\nPelargonium, a _single_ flower in the truss is frequently peloric, and\r\nwhen this occurs I have during several years invariably observed it to\r\nbe the central flower. This is of such frequent occurrence that one\r\nobserver[14] gives the names of ten varieties flowering at the same\r\ntime, in every one of which the central flower was peloric.\r\nOccasionally more than one flower in the truss is peloric, and then of\r\ncourse the additional ones must be lateral. These flowers are\r\ninteresting as showing how the whole structure is correlated. In the\r\ncommon Pelargonium the upper sepal is produced into a nectary which\r\ncoheres with the flower-peduncle; the two upper petals differ a little\r\nin shape from the three lower ones, and are marked with dark shades of\r\ncolour; the stamens are graduated in length and upturned. In the\r\npeloric flowers, the nectary aborts; all the petals become alike both\r\nin shape and colour; the stamens are generally reduced in number and\r\nbecome straight, so that the whole flower resembles that of the allied\r\ngenus Erodium. The correlation between these changes is well shown when\r\none of the two upper petals alone loses its dark mark, for in this case\r\nthe nectary does not entirely abort, but is usually much reduced in\r\nlength.[15]\r\n\r\nMorren has described[16] a marvellous flask-shaped flower of the\r\nCalceolaria, nearly four inches in length, which was almost completely\r\npeloric; it grew on the summit of the plant, with a normal flower on\r\neach side; Prof. Westwood also has described[17] three similar peloric\r\nflowers, which all occupied a central position on the flower-branches.\r\nIn the Orchideous genus, Phalænopsis, the terminal flower has been seen\r\nto become peloric.\r\n\r\nIn a Laburnum-tree I observed that about a fourth part of the racemes\r\nproduced terminal flowers which had lost their papilionaceous\r\nstructure. These were produced after almost all the other flowers on\r\nthe same racemes had withered. The most perfectly pelorised examples\r\nhad six petals, each marked with black striae like those on the\r\nstandard-petal. The keel seemed to resist the change more than the\r\nother petals. Dutrochet has described[18] an exactly similar case in\r\nFrance, and I believe these are the only two instances of pelorism in\r\nthe laburnum which have been recorded. Dutrochet remarks that the\r\nracemes on this tree do not properly produce a terminal flower, so that\r\n(as in the case of the Galeobdolon) their position as well as structure\r\nare both anomalies, which no doubt are in some manner related. Dr.\r\nMasters has briefly described another leguminous plant,[19] namely, a\r\nspecies of clover, in which the uppermost and central flowers were\r\nregular or had lost their papilionaceous structure. In some of these\r\nplants the flower-heads were also proliferous.\r\n\r\nLastly, Linaria produces two kinds of peloric flowers, one having\r\nsimple petals, and the other having them all spurred. The two forms, as\r\nNaudin remarks,[20] not rarely occur on the same plant, but in this\r\ncase the spurred form almost invariably stands on the summit of the\r\nspike.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in the terminal or central flower to become peloric more\r\nfrequently than the other flowers, probably results from “the bud which\r\nstands on the end of a shoot receiving the most sap; it grows out into\r\na stronger shoot than those situated lower down.”[21] I have discussed\r\nthe connection between pelorism and a central position, partly because\r\nsome few plants are known normally to produce a terminal flower\r\ndifferent in structure from the lateral ones; but chiefly on account of\r\nthe following case, in which we see a tendency to variability or to\r\nreversion connected with the same position. A great judge of\r\nAuriculas[22] states that when one throws up a side bloom it is pretty\r\nsure to keep its character; but that if it grows from the centre or\r\nheart of the plant, whatever the colour of the edging ought to be, “it\r\nis just as likely to come in any other class as in the one to which it\r\nproperly belongs.” This is so notorious a fact, that some florists\r\nregularly pinch off the central trusses of flowers. Whether in the\r\nhighly improved varieties the departure of the central trusses from\r\ntheir proper type is due to reversion, I do not know. Mr. Dombrain\r\ninsists that, whatever may be the commonest kind of imperfection in\r\neach variety, this is generally exaggerated in the central truss. Thus\r\none variety “sometimes has the fault of producing a little green floret\r\nin the centre of the flower,” and in central blooms these become\r\nexcessive in size. In some central blooms, sent to me by Mr. Dombrain,\r\nall the organs of the flower were rudimentary in structure, of minute\r\nsize, and of a green colour, so that by a little further change all\r\nwould have been converted into small leaves. In this case we clearly\r\nsee a tendency to prolification—a term which I may explain, for those\r\nwho have never attended to botany, to mean the production of a branch\r\nor flower, or head of flowers, out of another flower. Now Dr.\r\nMasters[23] states that the central or uppermost flower on a plant is\r\ngenerally the most liable to prolification. Thus, in the varieties of\r\nthe Auricula, the loss of their proper character and a tendency to\r\nprolification, also a tendency to prolification with pelorism, are all\r\nconnected together, and are due either to arrested development, or to\r\nreversion to a former condition.\r\n\r\nThe following is a more interesting case; Metzger[24] cultivated in\r\nGermany several kinds of maize brought from the hotter parts of\r\nAmerica, and he found, as previously described, that in two or three\r\ngenerations the grains became greatly changed in form, size, and\r\ncolour; and with respect to two races he expressly states that in the\r\nfirst generation, whilst the lower grains on each head retained their\r\nproper character, the uppermost grains already began to assume that\r\ncharacter which in the third generation all the grains acquired. As we\r\ndo not know the aboriginal parent of the maize, we cannot tell whether\r\nthese changes are in any way connected with reversion.\r\n\r\nIn the two following cases, reversion comes into play and is determined\r\nby the position of the seed in the capsule. The Blue Imperial pea is\r\nthe offspring of the Blue Prussian, and has larger seed and broader\r\npods than its parent. Now Mr. Masters, of Canterbury, a careful\r\nobserver and a raiser of new varieties of the pea, states[25] that the\r\nBlue Imperial always has a strong tendency to revert to its\r\nparent-stock, and the reversion “occurs in this manner: the last (or\r\nuppermost) pea in the pod is frequently much smaller than the rest; and\r\nif these small peas are carefully collected and sown separately, very\r\nmany more, in proportion, will revert to their origin, than those taken\r\nfrom the other parts of the pod.” Again, M. Chaté[26] says that in\r\nraising seedling stocks he succeeds in getting eighty per cent to bear\r\ndouble flowers, by leaving only a few of the secondary branches to\r\nseed; but in addition to this, “at the time of extracting the seeds,\r\nthe upper portion of the pod is separated and placed aside, because it\r\nhas been ascertained that the plants coming from the seeds situated in\r\nthis portion of the pod, give eighty per cent of single flowers.” Now\r\nthe production of single-flowering plants from the seed of\r\ndouble-flowering plants is clearly a case of reversion. These latter\r\nfacts, as well as the connection between a central position and\r\npelorism and prolification, show in an interesting manner how small a\r\ndifference—namely, a little greater or less freedom in the flow of sap\r\ntowards one part of the plant—determines important changes of\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n_Analogous or Parallel Variation._—By this term I mean that similar\r\ncharacters occasionally make their appearance in the several varieties\r\nor races descended from the same species, and more rarely in the\r\noffspring of widely distinct species. We are here concerned, not as\r\nhitherto with the causes of variation, but with the results; but this\r\ndiscussion could not have been more conveniently introduced elsewhere.\r\nThe cases of analogous variation, as far as their origin is concerned,\r\nmay be grouped, disregarding minor subdivisions, under two main heads;\r\nfirstly, those due to unknown causes acting on similarly constituted\r\norganisms, and which consequently have varied in a similar manner; and\r\nsecondly, those due to the reappearance of characters which were\r\npossessed by a more or less remote progenitor. But these two main\r\ndivisions can often be separated only conjecturally, and graduate, as\r\nwe shall presently see, into each other.\r\n\r\nUnder the first head of analogous variations, not due to reversion, we\r\nhave the many cases of trees belonging to quite different orders which\r\nhave produced pendulous and fastigiate varieties. The beech, hazel, and\r\nbarberry have given rise to purple-leaved varieties; and, as Bernhardi\r\nremarks,[27] a multitude of plants, as distinct as possible, have\r\nyielded varieties with deeply-cut or laciniated leaves. Varieties\r\ndescended from three distinct species of Brassica have their stems, or\r\nso-called roots, enlarged into globular masses. The nectarine is the\r\noffspring of the peach; and the varieties of peaches and nectarines\r\noffer a remarkable parallelism in the fruit being white, red, or yellow\r\nfleshed—in being clingstones or freestones—in the flowers being large\r\nor small—in the leaves being serrated or crenated, furnished with\r\nglobose or reniform glands, or quite destitute of glands. It should be\r\nremarked that each variety of the nectarine has not derived its\r\ncharacter from a corresponding variety of the peach. The several\r\nvarieties also of a closely allied genus, namely the apricot, differ\r\nfrom one another in nearly the same parallel manner. There is no reason\r\nto believe that any of these varieties have merely reacquired long-lost\r\ncharacters; and in most of them this certainly is not the case.\r\n\r\nThree species of Cucurbita have yielded a multitude of races which\r\ncorrespond so closely in character that, as Naudin insists, they may be\r\narranged in almost strictly parallel series. Several varieties of the\r\nmelon are interesting from resembling, in important characters, other\r\nspecies, either of the same genus or of allied genera; thus, one\r\nvariety has fruit so like, both externally and internally, the fruit of\r\na perfectly distinct species, namely, the cucumber, as hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from it; another has long cylindrical fruit twisting\r\nabout like a serpent; in another the seeds adhere to portions of the\r\npulp; in another the fruit, when ripe, suddenly cracks and falls into\r\npieces; and all these highly remarkable peculiarities are\r\ncharacteristic of species belonging to allied genera. We can hardly\r\naccount for the appearance of so many unusual characters by reversion\r\nto a single ancient form; but we must believe that all the members of\r\nthe family have inherited a nearly similar constitution from an early\r\nprogenitor. Our cereal and many other plants offer similar cases.\r\n\r\nWith animals we have fewer cases of analogous variation, independently\r\nof direct reversion. We see something of the kind in the resemblance\r\nbetween the short-muzzled races of the dog, such as the pug and\r\nbull-dog; in feather-footed races of the fowl, pigeon, and canary-bird;\r\nin horses of the most different races presenting the same range of\r\ncolour; in all black-and-tan dogs having tan-coloured eye-spots and\r\nfeet, but in this latter case reversion may possibly have played a\r\npart. Low has remarked[28] that several breeds of cattle are\r\n“sheeted,”—that is, have a broad band of white passing round their\r\nbodies like a sheet; this character is strongly inherited, and\r\nsometimes originates from a cross; it may be the first step in\r\nreversion to an early type, for, as was shown in the third chapter,\r\nwhite cattle with dark ears, dark feet and tip of tail, formerly\r\nexisted, and now exist in feral or semi-feral condition in several\r\nquarters of the world.\r\n\r\nUnder our second main division, namely, of analogous variations due to\r\nreversion, the best cases are afforded by pigeons. In all the most\r\ndistinct breeds, sub-varieties occasionally appear coloured exactly\r\nlike the parent rock-pigeon, with black wing-bars, white loins, banded\r\ntail, etc.; and no one can doubt that these characters are due to\r\nreversion. So with minor details; turbits properly have white tails,\r\nbut occasionally a bird is born with a dark-coloured and banded tail;\r\npouters properly have their primary wing-feathers white, but not rarely\r\na “sword-flighted” bird appears, that is, one with the few first\r\nprimaries dark-coloured; and in these cases we have characters proper\r\nto the rock-pigeon, but new to the breed, evidently appearing from\r\nreversion. In some domestic varieties the wing-bars, instead of being\r\nsimply black, as in the rock-pigeon, are beautifully edged with\r\ndifferent zones of colour, and they then present a striking analogy\r\nwith the wing-bars in certain natural species of the same family, such\r\nas _Phaps chalcoptera_; and this may probably be accounted for by all\r\nthe species of the family being descended from the same remote\r\nprogenitor and having a tendency to vary in the same manner. Thus,\r\nalso, we can perhaps understand the fact of some Laugher-pigeons cooing\r\nalmost like turtle-doves, and for several races having peculiarities in\r\ntheir flight, since certain natural species (viz., _C. torquatrix_ and\r\n_palumbus_), display singular vagaries in this respect. In other cases\r\na race, instead of imitating a distinct species, resembles some other\r\nrace; thus, certain runts tremble and slightly elevate their tails,\r\nlike fantails; and turbits inflate the upper part of their oesophagus,\r\nlike pouter-pigeons.\r\n\r\nIt is a common circumstance to find certain coloured marks persistently\r\ncharacterising all the species of a genus, but differing much in tint;\r\nand the same thing occurs with the varieties of the pigeon: thus,\r\ninstead of the general plumage being blue, with the wing-bars black,\r\nthere are snow-white varieties with red bars, and black varieties with\r\nwhite bars; in other varieties the wing-bars, as we have seen, are\r\nelegantly zoned with different tints. The Spot pigeon is characterised\r\nby the whole plumage being white, excepting a spot on the forehead and\r\nthe tail; but these parts may be red, yellow, or black. In the\r\nrock-pigeon and in many varieties the tail is blue, with the outer\r\nedges of the outer feathers white; but in the sub-variety of the\r\nmonk-pigeon we have a reversed style of coloration, for the tail is\r\nwhite, except the outer edges of the outer feathers, which are\r\nblack.[29]\r\n\r\nWith some species of birds, for instance with gulls, certain coloured\r\nparts appear as if almost washed out, and I have observed exactly the\r\nsame appearance in the terminal dark tail-bar in certain pigeons, and\r\nin the whole plumage of certain varieties of the duck. Analogous facts\r\nin the vegetable kingdom could be given.\r\n\r\nMany sub-varieties of the pigeon have reversed and somewhat lengthened\r\nfeathers on the back part of their heads, and this is certainly not due\r\nto reversion to the parent-species, which shows no trace of such\r\nstructure: but when we remember that sub-varieties of the fowl, turkey,\r\ncanary-bird, duck, and goose, all have either topknots or reversed\r\nfeathers on their heads; and when we remember that scarcely a single\r\nlarge natural group of birds can be named, in which some members have\r\nnot a tuft of feathers on their heads, we may suspect that reversion to\r\nsome extremely remote form has come into action.\r\n\r\nSeveral breeds of the fowl have either spangled or pencilled feathers;\r\nand these cannot be derived from the parent-species, the _Gallus\r\nbankiva_; though of course it is possible that one early progenitor of\r\nthis species may have been spangled, and another pencilled. But, as\r\nmany gallinaceous birds are either spangled or pencilled, it is a more\r\nprobable view that the several domestic breeds of the fowl have\r\nacquired this kind of plumage from all the members of the family\r\ninheriting a tendency to vary in a like manner. The same principle may\r\naccount for the ewes in certain breeds of sheep being hornless, like\r\nthe females of some other hollow-horned ruminants; it may account for\r\ncertain domestic cats having slightly-tufted ears, like those of the\r\nlynx; and for the skulls of domestic rabbits often differing from one\r\nanother in the same characters by which the skulls of the various\r\nspecies of the genus Lepus differ.\r\n\r\nI will only allude to one other case, already discussed. Now that we\r\nknow that the wild parent of the ass commonly has striped legs, we may\r\nfeel confident that the occasional appearance of stripes on the legs of\r\nthe domestic ass is due to reversion; but this will not account for the\r\nlower end of the shoulder-stripe being sometimes angularly bent or\r\nslightly forked. So, again, when we see dun and other coloured horses\r\nwith stripes on the spine, shoulders, and legs, we are led, from\r\nreasons formerly given, to believe that they reappear through reversion\r\nto the wild parent-horse. But when horses have two or three\r\nshoulder-stripes, with one of them occasionally forked at the lower\r\nend, or when they have stripes on their faces, or are faintly striped\r\nas foals over nearly their whole bodies, with the stripes angularly\r\nbent one under the other on the forehead, or irregularly branched in\r\nother parts, it would be rash to attribute such diversified characters\r\nto the reappearance of those proper to the aboriginal wild horse. As\r\nthree African species of the genus are much striped, and as we have\r\nseen that the crossing of the unstriped species often leads to the\r\nhybrid offspring being conspicuously striped—bearing also in mind that\r\nthe act of crossing certainly causes the reappearance of long-lost\r\ncharacters—it is a more probable view that the above-specified stripes\r\nare due to reversion, not to the immediate wild parent-horse, but to\r\nthe striped progenitor of the whole genus.\r\n\r\nI have discussed this subject of analogous variation at considerable\r\nlength, because it is well known that the varieties of one species\r\nfrequently resemble distinct species—a fact in perfect harmony with the\r\nforegoing cases, and explicable on the theory of descent. Secondly,\r\nbecause these facts are important from showing, as remarked in a former\r\nchapter, that each trifling variation is governed by law, and is\r\ndetermined in a much higher degree by the nature of the organisation,\r\nthan by the nature of the conditions to which the varying being has\r\nbeen exposed. Thirdly, because these facts are to a certain extent\r\nrelated to a more general law, namely, that which Mr. B. D. Walsh[30]\r\nhas called the “Law of _Equable Variability,_” or, as he explains it,\r\n“if any given character is very variable in one species of a group, it\r\nwill tend to be variable in allied species; and if any given character\r\nis perfectly constant in one species of a group, it will tend to be\r\nconstant in allied species.”\r\n\r\nThis leads me to recall a discussion in the chapter on Selection, in\r\nwhich it was shown that with domestic races, which are now undergoing\r\nrapid improvement, those parts or characters vary the most, which are\r\nthe most valued. This naturally follows from recently selected\r\ncharacters continually tending to revert to their former less improved\r\nstandard, and from their being still acted on by the same agencies,\r\nwhatever these may be, which first caused the characters in question to\r\nvary. The same principle is applicable to natural species, for, as\r\nstated in my ‘Origin of Species’ generic characters are less variable\r\nthan specific characters; and the latter are those which have been\r\nmodified by variation and natural selection, since the period when all\r\nthe species belonging to the genus branched off from a common\r\nprogenitor, whilst generic characters are those which have remained\r\nunaltered from a much more remote epoch, and accordingly are now less\r\nvariable. This statement makes a near approach to Mr. Walsh’s law of\r\nEquable Variability. Secondary sexual characters, it may be added,\r\nrarely serve to characterise distinct genera, for they usually differ\r\nmuch in the species of the same genus, and they are highly variable in\r\nthe individuals of the same species; we have also seen in the earlier\r\nchapters of this work how variable secondary sexual characters become\r\nunder domestication.\r\n\r\n      _Summary of the three previous Chapters on the Laws of\r\n      Variation._\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-third chapter we saw that changed conditions\r\noccasionally, or even often, act in a definite manner on the\r\norganisation, so that all, or nearly all, the individuals thus exposed\r\nbecome modified in the same manner. But a far more frequent result of\r\nchanged conditions, whether acting directly on the organisation or\r\nindirectly through the reproductive system, is indefinite and\r\nfluctuating variability. In the three last chapters, some of the laws\r\nby which such variability is regulated have been discussed.\r\n\r\nIncreased use adds to the size of muscles, together with the\r\nblood-vessels, nerves, ligaments, the crests of bone and the whole\r\nbones, to which they are attached. Increased functional activity\r\nincreases the size of various glands, and strengthens the sense-organs.\r\nIncreased and intermittent pressure thickens the epidermis. A change in\r\nthe nature of the food sometimes modifies the coats of the stomach, and\r\naugments or decreases the length of the intestines. Continued disuse,\r\non the other hand, weakens and diminishes all parts of the\r\norganisation. Animals which during many generations have taken but\r\nlittle exercise, have their lungs reduced in size, and as a consequence\r\nthe bony fabric of the chest and the whole form of the body become\r\nmodified. With our anciently domesticated birds, the wings have been\r\nlittle used, and they are slightly reduced; with their decrease, the\r\ncrest of the sternum, the scapulae, coracoids, and furculum, have all\r\nbeen reduced.\r\n\r\nWith domesticated animals, the reduction of a part from disuse is never\r\ncarried so far that a mere rudiment is left; whereas we have reason to\r\nbelieve that this has often occurred under nature; the effects of\r\ndisuse in this latter case being aided by economy of growth, together\r\nwith the intercrossing of many varying individuals. The cause of this\r\ndifference between organisms in a state of nature, and under\r\ndomestication, probably is that in the latter case there has not been\r\ntime sufficient for any very great change, and that the principle of\r\neconomy of growth does not come into action. On the contrary,\r\nstructures which are rudimentary in the parent-species, sometimes\r\nbecome partially redeveloped in our domesticated productions. Such\r\nrudiments as occasionally make their appearance under domestication,\r\nseem always to be the result of a sudden arrest of development;\r\nnevertheless they are of interest, as showing that rudiments are the\r\nrelics of organs once perfectly developed.\r\n\r\nCorporeal, periodical, and mental habits, though the latter have been\r\nalmost passed over in this work, become changed under domestication,\r\nand the changes are often inherited. Such changed habits in an organic\r\nbeing, especially when living a free life, would often lead to the\r\naugmented or diminished use of various organs, and consequently to\r\ntheir modification. From long-continued habit, and more especially from\r\nthe occasional birth of individuals with a slightly different\r\nconstitution, domestic animals and cultivated plants become to a\r\ncertain extent acclimatised or adapted to a climate different from that\r\nproper to the parent-species.\r\n\r\nThrough the principle of correlated variability, taken in its widest\r\nsense, when one part varies other parts vary, either simultaneously, or\r\none after the other. Thus, an organ modified during an early embryonic\r\nperiod affects other parts subsequently developed. When an organ, such\r\nas the beak, increases or decreases in length, adjoining or correlated\r\nparts, as the tongue and the orifice of the nostrils, tend to vary in\r\nthe same manner. When the whole body increases or decreases in size,\r\nvarious parts become modified; thus, with pigeons the ribs increase or\r\ndecrease in number and breadth. Homologous parts which are identical\r\nduring their early development and are exposed to similar conditions,\r\ntend to vary in the same or in some connected manner,—as in the case of\r\nthe right and left sides of the body, and of the front and hind limbs.\r\nSo it is with the organs of sight and hearing; for instance, white cats\r\nwith blue eyes are almost always deaf. There is a manifest relation\r\nthroughout the body between the skin and various dermal appendages,\r\nsuch as hair, feathers, hoofs, horns, and teeth. In Paraguay, horses\r\nwith curly hair have hoofs like those of a mule; the wool and the horns\r\nof sheep often vary together; hairless dogs are deficient in their\r\nteeth; men with redundant hair have abnormal teeth, either by\r\ndeficiency or excess. Birds with long wing-feathers usually have long\r\ntail-feathers. When long feathers grow from the outside of the legs and\r\ntoes of pigeons, the two outer toes are connected by membrane; for the\r\nwhole leg tends to assume the structure of the wing. There is a\r\nmanifest relation between a crest of feathers on the head and a\r\nmarvellous amount of change in the skull of various fowls; and in a\r\nlesser degree, between the greatly elongated, lopping ears of rabbits\r\nand the structure of their skulls. With plants, the leaves, various\r\nparts of the flower, and the fruit, often vary together to a correlated\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we find correlation without being able even to conjecture\r\nwhat is the nature of the connection, as with various monstrosities and\r\ndiseases. This is likewise the case with the colour of the adult\r\npigeon, in connection with the presence of down on the young bird.\r\nNumerous curious instances have been given of peculiarities of\r\nconstitution, in correlation with colour, as shown by the immunity of\r\nindividuals of one colour from certain diseases, from the attacks of\r\nparasites and from the action of certain vegetable poisons.\r\n\r\nCorrelation is an important subject; for with species, and in a lesser\r\ndegree with domestic races, we continually find that certain parts have\r\nbeen greatly modified to serve some useful purpose; but we almost\r\ninvariably find that other parts have likewise been more or less\r\nmodified, without our being able to discover any advantage in the\r\nchange. No doubt great caution is necessary with respect to this latter\r\npoint, for it is difficult to overrate our ignorance on the use of\r\nvarious parts of the organisation; but from what we have seen, we may\r\nbelieve that many modifications are of no direct service, having arisen\r\nin correlation with other and useful changes.\r\n\r\nHomologous parts during their early development often become fused\r\ntogether. Multiple and homologous organs are especially liable to vary\r\nin number and probably in form. As the supply of organised matter is\r\nnot unlimited, the principle of compensation sometimes comes into\r\naction; so that, when one part is greatly developed, adjoining parts\r\nare apt to be reduced; but this principle is probably of much less\r\nimportance than the more general one of the economy of growth. Through\r\nmere mechanical pressure hard parts occasionally affect adjoining\r\nparts. With plants the position of the flowers on the axis, and of the\r\nseeds in the ovary, sometimes leads, through a more or less free flow\r\nof sap, to changes of structure; but such changes are often due to\r\nreversion. Modifications, in whatever manner caused, will be to a\r\ncertain extent regulated by that co-ordinating power, or so-called\r\n_nisus formativus,_ which is in fact a remnant of that simple form of\r\nreproduction, displayed by many lowly organised beings in their power\r\nof fissiparous generation and budding. Finally, the effects of the laws\r\nwhich directly or indirectly govern variability, may be largely\r\nregulated by man’s selection, and will so far be determined by natural\r\nselection that changes advantageous to any race will be favoured, and\r\ndisadvantageous changes will be checked.\r\n\r\nDomestic races descended from the same species, or from two or more\r\nallied species, are liable to revert to characters derived from their\r\ncommon progenitor; and, as they inherit a somewhat similar\r\nconstitution, they are liable to vary in the same manner. From these\r\ntwo causes analogous varieties often arise. When we reflect on the\r\nseveral foregoing laws, imperfectly as we understand them, and when we\r\nbear in mind how much remains to be discovered, we need not be\r\nsurprised at the intricate and to us unintelligible manner in which our\r\ndomestic productions have varied, and still go on varying.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] ‘Hist. des Anomalies,’ 1832, tom. i. pp. 22, 537-556; tom. iii. p.\r\n 462.\r\n\r\n [2] ‘Comptes Rendus,’ 1855, pp. 855, 1039.\r\n\r\n [3] ‘Catalogue of the Teratological Series in the Museum of the R.\r\n Coll. of Surgeons,’ 1872, p. 16.\r\n\r\n [4] ‘Archives de Zoolog.

PROVISIONAL HYPOTHESIS OF PANGENESIS.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS—FIRST PART: THE FACTS TO BE CONNECTED UNDER A\r\nSINGLE POINT OF VIEW, NAMELY, THE VARIOUS KINDS OF\r\nREPRODUCTION—RE-GROWTH OF AMPUTATED PARTS—GRAFT-HYBRIDS—THE DIRECT\r\nACTION OF THE MALE ELEMENT ON THE FEMALE—DEVELOPMENT—THE FUNCTIONAL\r\nINDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITS OF THE\r\nBODY—VARIABILITY—INHERITANCE—REVERSION—SECOND PART: STATEMENT OF THE\r\nHYPOTHESIS—HOW FAR THE NECESSARY ASSUMPTIONS ARE IMPROBABLE—EXPLANATION\r\nBY AID OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE SEVERAL CLASSES OF FACTS SPECIFIED IN\r\nTHE FIRST PART—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters large classes of facts, such as those bearing\r\non bud-variation, the various forms of inheritance, the causes and laws\r\nof variation, have been discussed; and it is obvious that these\r\nsubjects, as well as the several modes of reproduction, stand in some\r\nsort of relation to one another. I have been led, or rather forced, to\r\nform a view which to a certain extent connects these facts by a\r\ntangible method. Every one would wish to explain to himself, even in an\r\nimperfect manner, how it is possible for a character possessed by some\r\nremote ancestor suddenly to reappear in the offspring; how the effects\r\nof increased or decreased use of a limb can be transmitted to the\r\nchild; how the male sexual element can act not solely on the ovules,\r\nbut occasionally on the mother-form; how a hybrid can be produced by\r\nthe union of the cellular tissue of two plants independently of the\r\norgans of generation; how a limb can be reproduced on the exact line of\r\namputation, with neither too much nor too little added; how the same\r\norganism may be produced by such widely different processes, as budding\r\nand true seminal generation; and, lastly, how of two allied forms, one\r\npasses in the course of its development through the most complex\r\nmetamorphoses, and the other does not do so, though when mature both\r\nare alike in every detail of structure. I am aware that my view is\r\nmerely a provisional hypothesis or speculation; but until a better one\r\nbe advanced, it will serve to bring together a multitude of facts which\r\nare at present left disconnected by any efficient cause. As Whewell,\r\nthe historian of the inductive sciences, remarks:—“Hypotheses may often\r\nbe of service to science, when they involve a certain portion of\r\nincompleteness, and even of error.” Under this point of view I venture\r\nto advance the hypothesis of Pangenesis, which implies that every\r\nseparate part of the whole organisation reproduces itself. So that\r\novules, spermatozoa, and pollen-grains,—the fertilised egg or seed, as\r\nwell as buds,—include and consist of a multitude of germs thrown off\r\nfrom each separate part or unit.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the First Part I will enumerate as briefly as I can the groups of\r\nfacts which seem to demand connection; but certain subjects, not\r\nhitherto discussed, must be treated at disproportionate length. In the\r\nSecond Part the hypothesis will be given; and after considering how far\r\nthe necessary assumptions are in themselves improbable, we shall see\r\nwhether it serves to bring under a single point of view the various\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nReproduction may be divided into two main classes, namely, sexual and\r\nasexual. The latter is effected in many ways—by the formation of buds\r\nof various kinds, and by fissiparous generation, that is by spontaneous\r\nor artificial division. It is notorious that some of the lower animals,\r\nwhen cut into many pieces, reproduce so many perfect individuals:\r\nLyonnet cut a Nais or freshwater worm into nearly forty pieces, and\r\nthese all reproduced perfect animals.[2] It is probable that\r\nsegmentation could be carried much further in some of the protozoa; and\r\nwith some of the lowest plants each cell will reproduce the\r\nparent-form. Johannes Müller thought that there was an important\r\ndistinction between gemmation and fission; for in the latter case the\r\ndivided portion, however small, is more fully developed than a bud,\r\nwhich also is a younger formation; but most physiologists are now\r\nconvinced that the two processes are essentially alike.[3] Prof. Huxley\r\nremarks, “fission is little more than a peculiar mode of budding,” and\r\nProf. H. J. Clark shows in detail that there is sometimes “a compromise\r\nbetween self-division and budding.” When a limb is amputated, or when\r\nthe whole body is bisected, the cut extremities are said to bud\r\nforth;[4] and as the papilla, which is first formed, consists of\r\nundeveloped cellular tissue like that forming an ordinary bud, the\r\nexpression is apparently correct. We see the connection of the two\r\nprocesses in another way; for Trembley observed with the hydra, that\r\nthe reproduction of the head after amputation was checked as soon as\r\nthe animal put forth reproductive gemmæ.[5]\r\n\r\nBetween the production, by fissiparous generation, of two or more\r\ncomplete individuals, and the repair of even a very slight injury,\r\nthere is so perfect a gradation, that it is impossible to doubt that\r\nthe two processes are connected. As at each stage of growth an\r\namputated part is replaced by one in the same state of development, we\r\nmust also follow Sir J. Paget in admitting, “that the powers of\r\ndevelopment from the embryo, are identical with those exercised for the\r\nrestoration from injuries: in other words, that the powers are the same\r\nby which perfection is first achieved, and by which, when lost, it is\r\nrecovered.”[6] Finally, we may conclude that the several forms of\r\nbudding, fissiparous generation, the repair of injuries, and\r\ndevelopment, are all essentially the results of one and the same power.\r\n\r\n_Sexual Generation._—The union of the two sexual elements seems at\r\nfirst sight to make a broad distinction between sexual and asexual\r\ngeneration. But the conjugation of algæ, by which process the contents\r\nof two cells unite into a single mass capable of development,\r\napparently gives us the first step towards sexual union: and\r\nPringsheim, in his memoir on the pairing of Zoospores,[7] shows that\r\nconjugation graduates into true sexual reproduction. Moreover, the now\r\nwell-ascertained cases of Parthenogenesis prove that the distinction\r\nbetween sexual and asexual generation is not nearly so great as was\r\nformerly thought; for ova occasionally, and even in some cases\r\nfrequently, become developed into perfect beings, without the concourse\r\nof the male. With most of the lower animals and even with mammals, the\r\nova show a trace of parthenogenetic power, for without being fertilised\r\nthey pass through the first stages of segmentation.[8] Nor can pseudova\r\nwhich do not need fertilisation, be distinguished from true ova, as was\r\nfirst shown by Sir J. Lubbock, and is now admitted by Siebold. So,\r\nagain, the germ-balls in the larvæ of Cecidomyia are said by\r\nLeuckart[9] to be formed within the ovarium, but they do not require to\r\nbe fertilised. It should also be observed that in sexual generation,\r\nthe ovules and the male element have equal power of transmitting every\r\nsingle character possessed by either parent to their offspring. We see\r\nthis clearly when hybrids are paired _inter se,_ for the characters of\r\nboth grandparents often appear in the progeny, either perfectly or by\r\nsegments. It is an error to suppose that the male transmits certain\r\ncharacters and the female other characters; although no doubt, from\r\nunknown causes, one sex sometimes has a much stronger power of\r\ntransmission than the other.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been maintained by some authors that a bud differs\r\nessentially from a fertilised germ, in always reproducing the perfect\r\ncharacter of the parent-stock; whilst fertilised germs give birth to\r\nvariable beings. But there is no such broad distinction as this. In the\r\neleventh chapter numerous cases were advanced showing that buds\r\noccasionally grow into plants having quite new characters; and the\r\nvarieties thus produced can be propagated for a length of time by buds,\r\nand occasionally by seed. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that beings\r\nproduced sexually are much more liable to vary than those produced\r\nasexually; and of this fact a partial explanation will hereafter be\r\nattempted. The variability in both cases is determined by the same\r\ngeneral causes, and is governed by the same laws. Hence new varieties\r\narising from buds cannot be distinguished from those arising from seed.\r\nAlthough bud-varieties usually retain their character during successive\r\nbud-generations, yet they occasionally revert, even after a long series\r\nof bud-generations, to their former character. This tendency to\r\nreversion in buds, is one of the most remarkable of the several points\r\nof agreement between the offspring from bud and seminal reproduction.\r\n\r\nBut there is one difference between organisms produced sexually and\r\nasexually, which is very general. The former pass in the course of\r\ntheir development from a very low stage to their highest stage, as we\r\nsee in the metamorphoses of insects and of many other animals, and in\r\nthe concealed metamorphoses of the vertebrata. Animals propagated\r\nasexually by buds or fission, on the other hand, commence their\r\ndevelopment at that stage at which the budding or self-dividing animal\r\nmay happen to be, and therefore do not pass through some of the lower\r\ndevelopmental stages.[10] Afterwards, they often advance in\r\norganisation, as we see in the many cases of “alternate generation.” In\r\nthus speaking of alternate generation, I follow those naturalists who\r\nlook at this process as essentially one of internal budding or of\r\nfissiparous generation. Some of the lower plants, however, such as\r\nmosses and certain algæ, according to Dr. L. Radlkofer,[11] when\r\npropagated asexually, do undergo a retrogressive metamorphosis. As far\r\nas the final cause is concerned, we can to a certain extent understand\r\nwhy beings propagated by buds should not pass through all the early\r\nstages of development; for with each organism the structure acquired at\r\neach stage must be adapted to its peculiar habits; and if there are\r\nplaces for the support of many individuals at some one stage, the\r\nsimplest plan will be that they should be multiplied at this stage, and\r\nnot that they should first retrograde in their development to an\r\nearlier or simpler structure, which might not be fitted for the then\r\nsurrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nFrom the several foregoing considerations we may conclude that the\r\ndifference between sexual and asexual generation is not nearly so great\r\nas at first appears; the chief difference being that an ovule cannot\r\ncontinue to live and to be fully developed unless it unites with the\r\nmale element; but even this difference is far from invariable, as shown\r\nby the many cases of parthenogenesis. We are therefore naturally led to\r\ninquire what the final cause can be of the necessity in ordinary\r\ngeneration for the concourse of the two sexual elements.\r\n\r\nSeeds and ova are often highly serviceable as the means of\r\ndisseminating plants and animals, and of preserving them during one or\r\nmore seasons in a dormant state; but unimpregnated seeds or ova, and\r\ndetached buds, would be equally serviceable for both purposes. We can,\r\nhowever, indicate two important advantages gained by the concourse of\r\nthe two sexes, or rather of two individuals belonging to opposite\r\nsexes; for, as I have shown in a former chapter, the structure of every\r\norganism appears to be especially adapted for the concurrence, at least\r\noccasionally, of two individuals. When species are rendered highly\r\nvariable by changed conditions of life, the free intercrossing of the\r\nvarying individuals tends to keep each form fitted for its proper place\r\nin nature; and crossing can be effected only by sexual generation; but\r\nwhether the end thus gained is of sufficient importance to account for\r\nthe first origin of sexual intercourse is extremely doubtful. Secondly,\r\nI have shown from a large body of facts, that, as a slight change in\r\nthe conditions of life is beneficial to each creature, so, in an\r\nanalogous manner, is the change effected in the germ by sexual union\r\nwith a distinct individual; and I have been led, from observing the\r\nmany widely-extended provisions throughout nature for this purpose, and\r\nfrom the greater vigour of crossed organisms of all kinds, as proved by\r\ndirect experiments, as well as from the evil effects of close\r\ninterbreeding when long continued, to believe that the advantage thus\r\ngained is very great.\r\n\r\nWhy the germ, which before impregnation undergoes a certain amount of\r\ndevelopment, ceases to progress and perishes, unless it be acted on by\r\nthe male element; and why conversely the male element, which in the\r\ncase of some insects is enabled to keep alive for four or five years,\r\nand in the case of some plants for several years, likewise perishes,\r\nunless it acts on or unites with the germ, are questions which cannot\r\nbe answered with certainty. It is, however, probable that both sexual\r\nelements perish, unless brought into union, simply from including too\r\nlittle formative matter for independent development. Quatrefages has\r\nshown in the case of the Teredo,[12] as did formerly Prevost and Dumas\r\nwith other animals, that more than one spermatozoon is requisite to\r\nfertilise an ovum. This has likewise been shown by Newport,[13] who\r\nproved by numerous experiments, that, when a very small number of\r\nspermatozoa are applied to the ova of Batrachians, they are only\r\npartially impregnated, and an embryo is never fully developed. The rate\r\nalso of the segmentation of the ovum is determined by the number of the\r\nspermatozoa. With respect to plants, nearly the same results were\r\nobtained by Kölreuter and Gärtner. This last careful observer, after\r\nmaking successive trials on a Malva with more and more pollen-grains,\r\nfound,[14] that even thirty grains did not fertilise a single seed; but\r\nwhen forty grains were applied to the stigma, a few seeds of small size\r\nwere formed. In the case of Mirabilis the pollen grains are\r\nextraordinarily large, and the ovarium contains only a single ovule;\r\nand these circumstances led Naudin[15] to make the following\r\nexperiments: a flower was fertilised by three grains and succeeded\r\nperfectly; twelve flowers were fertilised by two grains, and seventeen\r\nflowers by a single grain, and of these one flower alone in each lot\r\nperfected its seed: and it deserves especial notice that the plants\r\nproduced by these two seeds never attained their proper dimensions, and\r\nbore flowers of remarkably small size. From these facts we clearly see\r\nthat the quantity of the peculiar formative matter which is contained\r\nwithin the spermatozoa and pollen-grains is an all-important element in\r\nthe act of fertilisation, not only for the full development of the\r\nseed, but for the vigour of the plant produced from such seed. We see\r\nsomething of the same kind in certain cases of parthenogenesis, that\r\nis, when the male element is wholly excluded; for M. Jourdan[16] found\r\nthat, out of about 58,000 eggs laid by unimpregnated silk-moths, many\r\npassed through their early embryonic stages, showing that they were\r\ncapable of self-development, but only twenty-nine out of the whole\r\nnumber produced caterpillars. The same principle of quantity seems to\r\nhold good even in artificial fissiparous reproduction, for Hackel[17]\r\nfound that by cutting the segmented and fertilised ova or larva of\r\nSiphonophoræ (jelly-fishes) into pieces, the smaller the pieces were,\r\nthe slower was the rate of development, and the larvæ thus produced\r\nwere by so much the more imperfect and inclined to monstrosity. It\r\nseems, therefore, probable that with the separate sexual elements\r\ndeficient quantity of formative matter is the main cause of their not\r\nhaving the capacity for prolonged existence and development, unless\r\nthey combine and thus increase each other’s bulk. The belief that it is\r\nthe function of the spermatozoa to communicate life to the ovule seems\r\na strange one, seeing that the unimpregnated ovule is already alive and\r\ngenerally undergoes a certain amount of independent development. Sexual\r\nand asexual reproduction are thus seen not to differ essentially; and\r\nwe have already shown that asexual reproduction, the power of re-growth\r\nand development are all parts of one and the same great law.\r\n\r\n_Re-growth of amputated parts._—This subject deserves a little further\r\ndiscussion. A multitude of the lower animals and some vertebrates\r\npossess this wonderful power. For instance, Spallanzani cut off the\r\nlegs and tail of the same salamander six times successively, and\r\nBonnet[18] did so eight times; and on each occasion the limbs were\r\nreproduced on the exact line of amputation, with no part deficient or\r\nin excess. An allied animal, the axolotl, had a limb bitten off, which\r\nwas reproduced in an abnormal condition, but when this was amputated it\r\nwas replaced by a perfect limb.[19] The new limbs in these cases bud\r\nforth, and are developed in the same manner as during the regular\r\ndevelopment of a young animal. For instance, with the _Amblystoma\r\nlurida,_ three toes are first developed, then the fourth, and on the\r\nhind-feet the fifth, and so it is with a reproduced limb.[20]\r\n\r\nThe power of re-growth is generally much greater during the youth of an\r\nanimal or during the earlier stages of its development than during\r\nmaturity. The larvæ or tadpoles of the Batrachians are capable of\r\nreproducing lost members, but not so the adults.[21] Mature insects\r\nhave no power of re-growth, excepting in one order, whilst the larvæ of\r\nmany kinds have this power. Animals low in the scale are able, as a\r\ngeneral rule, to reproduce lost parts far more easily than those which\r\nare more highly organised. The myriapods offer a good illustration of\r\nthis rule; but there are some strange exceptions to it—thus Nemerteans,\r\nthough lowly organised, are said to exhibit little power of re-growth.\r\nWith the higher vertebrata, such as birds and mammals, the power is\r\nextremely limited.[22]\r\n\r\nIn the case of those animals which may be bisected or chopped into\r\npieces, and of which every fragment will reproduce the whole, the power\r\nof re-growth must be diffused throughout the whole body. Nevertheless\r\nthere seems to be much truth in the view maintained by Prof.\r\nLessona,[23] that this capacity is generally a localised and special\r\none, serving to replace parts which are eminently liable to be lost in\r\neach particular animal. The most striking case in favour of this view,\r\nis that the terrestrial salamander, according to Lessona, cannot\r\nreproduce lost parts, whilst another species of the same genus, the\r\naquatic salamander, has extraordinary powers of re-growth, as we have\r\njust seen; and this animal is eminently liable to have its limbs, tail,\r\neyes and jaws bitten off by other tritons.[24] Even with the aquatic\r\nsalamander the capacity is to a certain extent localised, for when M.\r\nPhilipeaux[25] extirpated the entire fore limb together with the\r\nscapula, the power of re-growth was completely lost. It is also a\r\nremarkable fact, standing in opposition to a very general rule, that\r\nthe young of the aquatic salamander do not possess the power of\r\nrepairing their limbs in an equal degree with the adults[26] but I do\r\nnot know that they are more active, or can otherwise better escape the\r\nloss of their limbs, than the adults. The walking-stick insect,\r\n_Diapheromera femorata,_ like other insects of the same order, can\r\nreproduce its legs in the mature state, and these from their great\r\nlength must be liable to be lost: but the capacity is localised (as in\r\nthe case of the salamander), for Dr. Scudder found,[27] that if the\r\nlimb was removed within the trochanto-femoral articulation, it was\r\nnever renewed. When a crab is seized by one of its legs, this is thrown\r\noff at the basal joint, being afterwards replaced by a new leg; and it\r\nis generally admitted that this is a special provision for the safety\r\nof the animal. Lastly, with gasteropod molluscs, which are well known\r\nto have the power of reproducing their heads, Lessona shows that they\r\nare very liable to have their heads bitten off by fishes; the rest of\r\nthe body being protected by the shell. Even with plants we see\r\nsomething of the same kind, for non-deciduous leaves and young stems\r\nhave no power of re-growth, these parts being easily replaced by growth\r\nfrom new buds; whilst the bark and subjacent tissues of the trunks of\r\ntrees have great power of re-growth, probably on account of their\r\nincrease in diameter, and of their liability to injury from being\r\ngnawed by animals.\r\n\r\n_Graft-hybrids._—It is well known from innumerable trials made in all\r\nparts of the world, that buds may be inserted into a stock, and that\r\nthe plants thus raised are not affected in a greater degree than can be\r\naccounted for by changed nutrition. Nor do the seedlings raised from\r\nsuch inserted buds partake of the character of the stock, though they\r\nare more liable to vary than are seedlings from the same variety\r\ngrowing on its own roots. A bud, also, may sport into a new and\r\nstrongly-marked variety without any other bud on the same plant being\r\nin the least degree affected. We may therefore infer, in accordance\r\nwith the common view, that each bud is a distinct individual, and that\r\nits formative elements do not spread beyond the parts subsequently\r\ndeveloped from it. Nevertheless, we have seen in the abstract on\r\ngraft-hybridisation in the eleventh chapter that buds certainly include\r\nformative matter, which can occasionally combine with that included in\r\nthe tissues of a distinct variety or species; a plant intermediate\r\nbetween the two parent-forms being thus produced. In the case of the\r\npotato we have seen that the tubers produced from a bud of one kind\r\ninserted into another are intermediate in colour, size, shape and state\r\nof surface; that the stems, foliage, and even certain constitutional\r\npeculiarities, such as precocity, are likewise intermediate. With these\r\nwell-established cases, the evidence that graft-hybrids have also been\r\nproduced with the laburnum, orange, vine, rose, etc., seems sufficient.\r\nBut we do not know under what conditions this rare form of reproduction\r\nis possible. From these several cases we learn the important fact that\r\nformative elements capable of blending with those of a distinct\r\nindividual (and this is the chief characteristic of sexual generation),\r\nare not confined to the reproductive organs, but are present in the\r\nbuds and cellular tissue of plants; and this is a fact of the highest\r\nphysiological importance.\r\n\r\n_Direct Action of the Male Element on the Female._—In the eleventh\r\nchapter, abundant proofs were given that foreign pollen occasionally\r\naffects in a direct manner the mother-plant. Thus, when Gallesio\r\nfertilised an orange-flower with pollen from the lemon, the fruit bore\r\nstripes of perfectly characterised lemon-peel. With peas, several\r\nobservers have seen the colour of the seed-coats and even of the pod\r\ndirectly affected by the pollen of a distinct variety. So it has been\r\nwith the fruit of the apple, which consists of the modified calyx and\r\nupper part of the flower-stalk. In ordinary cases these parts are\r\nwholly formed by the mother-plant. We here see that the formative\r\nelements included within the male element or pollen of one variety can\r\naffect and hybridise, not the part which they are properly adapted to\r\naffect, namely, the ovules, but the partially-developed tissues of a\r\ndistinct variety or species. We are thus brought half-way towards a\r\ngraft-hybrid, in which the formative elements included within the\r\ntissues of one individual combine with those included in the tissues of\r\na distinct variety or species, thus giving rise to a new and\r\nintermediate form, independently of the male or female sexual organs.\r\n\r\nWith animals which do not breed until nearly mature, and of which all\r\nthe parts are then fully developed, it is hardly possible that the male\r\nelement should directly affect the female. But we have the analogous\r\nand perfectly well-ascertained case of the male element affecting (as\r\nwith the quagga and Lord Morton’s mare) the female or her ova, in such\r\na manner that when she is impregnated by another male her offspring are\r\naffected and hybridised by the first male. The explanation would be\r\nsimple if the spermatozoa could keep alive within the body of the\r\nfemale during the long interval which has sometimes elapsed between the\r\ntwo acts of impregnation; but no one will suppose that this is possible\r\nwith the higher animals.\r\n\r\n_Development._—The fertilised germ reaches maturity by a vast number of\r\nchanges: these are either slight and slowly effected, as when the child\r\ngrows into the man, or are great and sudden, as with the metamorphoses\r\nof most insects. Between these extremes we have every gradation, even\r\nwithin the same class; thus, as Sir J. Lubbock has shown[28] there is\r\nan Ephemerous insect which moults above twenty times, undergoing each\r\ntime a slight but decided change of structure; and these changes, as he\r\nfurther remarks, probably reveal to us the normal stages of\r\ndevelopment, which are concealed and hurried through or suppressed in\r\nmost other insects. In ordinary metamorphoses, the parts and organs\r\nappear to become changed into the corresponding parts in the next stage\r\nof development; but there is another form of development, which has\r\nbeen called by Professor Owen metagenesis. In this case “the new parts\r\nare not moulded upon the inner surface of the old ones. The plastic\r\nforce has changed its course of operation. The outer case, and all that\r\ngave form and character to the precedent individual, perish and are\r\ncast off; they are not changed into the corresponding parts of the new\r\nindividual. These are due to a new and distinct developmental process,”\r\netc.[29] Metamorphosis, however, graduates so insensibly, into\r\nmetagenesis, that the two processes cannot be distinctly separated. For\r\ninstance, in the last change which Cirripedes undergo, the alimentary\r\ncanal and some other organs are moulded on pre-existing parts; but the\r\neyes of the old and the young animal are developed in entirely\r\ndifferent parts of the body; the tips of the mature limbs are formed\r\nwithin the larval limbs, and may be said to be metamorphosed from them;\r\nbut their basal portions and the whole thorax are developed in a plane\r\nat right angles to the larval limbs and thorax; and this may be called\r\nmetagenesis. The metagenetic process is carried to an extreme point in\r\nthe development of some Echinoderms, for the animal in the second stage\r\nof development is formed almost like a bud within the animal of the\r\nfirst stage, the latter being then cast off like an old vestment, yet\r\nsometimes maintaining for a short period an independent vitality.[30]\r\n\r\nIf, instead of a single individual, several were to be thus developed\r\nmetagenetically within a pre-existing form, the process would be called\r\none of alternate generation. The young thus developed may either\r\nclosely resemble the encasing parent-form, as with the larvæ of\r\nCecidomyia, or may differ to an astonishing degree, as with many\r\nparasitic worms and jelly-fishes; but this does not make any essential\r\ndifference in the process, any more than the greatness or abruptness of\r\nthe change in the metamorphoses of insects.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of development is of great importance for our\r\npresent subject. When an organ, the eye, for instance, is\r\nmetagenetically formed in a part of the body where during the previous\r\nstage of development no eye existed, we must look at it as a new and\r\nindependent growth. The absolute independence of new and old\r\nstructures, although corresponding in structure and function, is still\r\nmore obvious when several individuals are formed within a previous\r\nform, as in the cases of alternate generation. The same important\r\nprinciple probably comes largely into play even in the case of\r\napparently continuous growth, as we shall see when we consider the\r\ninheritance of modifications at corresponding ages.\r\n\r\nWe are led to the same conclusion, namely, the independence of parts\r\nsuccessively developed, by another and quite distinct group of facts.\r\nIt is well known that many animals belonging to the same order, and\r\ntherefore not differing widely from each other, pass through an\r\nextremely different course of development. Thus certain beetles, not in\r\nany way remarkably different from others of the same order, undergo\r\nwhat has been called a hyper-metamorphosis—that is, they pass through\r\nan early stage wholly different from the ordinary grub-like larva. In\r\nthe same sub-order of crabs, namely, the Macroura, as Fritz Müller\r\nremarks, the river cray-fish is hatched under the same form which it\r\never afterwards retains; the young lobster has divided legs, like a\r\nMysis; the Palæmon appears under the form of a Zoea, and Peneus under\r\nthe Nauplius-form; and how wonderfully these larval forms differ from\r\none another, is known to every naturalist.[31] Some other crustaceans,\r\nas the same author observes, start from the same point and arrive at\r\nnearly the same end, but in the middle of their development are widely\r\ndifferent from one another. Still more striking cases could be given\r\nwith respect to the Echinodermata. With the Medusæ or jelly-fishes\r\nProfessor Allman observes, “The classification of the Hydroida would be\r\na comparatively simple task if, as has been erroneously asserted,\r\ngenerically-identical medusoids always arose from generically-identical\r\npolypoids; and, on the other hand, that generically-identical polypoids\r\nalways gave origin to generically-identical medusoids.” So again, Dr.\r\nStrethill Wright remarks, “In the life-history of the Hydroidæ any\r\nphase, planuloid, polypoid, or medusoid, may be absent.”[32]\r\n\r\nAccording to the belief now generally accepted by our best naturalists,\r\nall the members of the same order or class, for instance, the Medusæ or\r\nthe Macrourous crustaceans, are descended from a common progenitor.\r\nDuring their descent they have diverged much in structure, but have\r\nretained much in common; and this has occurred, though they have passed\r\nthrough and still pass through marvellously different metamorphoses.\r\nThis fact well illustrates how independent each structure is from that\r\nwhich precedes and that which follows it in the course of development.\r\n\r\n_The Functional Independence of the Elements or Units of the\r\nBody._—Physiologists agree that the whole organism consists of a\r\nmultitude of elemental parts, which are to a great extent independent\r\nof one another. Each organ, says Claude Bernard,[33] has its proper\r\nlife, its autonomy; it can develop and reproduce itself independently\r\nof the adjoining tissues. A great German authority, Virchow,[34]\r\nasserts still more emphatically that each system consists of an\r\n“enormous mass of minute centres of action. . . . Every element has its\r\nown special action, and even though it derive its stimulus to activity\r\nfrom other parts, yet alone effects the actual performance of duties. .\r\n. . Every single epithelial and muscular fibre-cell leads a sort of\r\nparasitical existence in relation to the rest of the body. . . . Every\r\nsingle bone-corpuscle really possesses conditions of nutrition peculiar\r\nto itself.” Each element, as Sir J. Paget remarks, lives its appointed\r\ntime and then dies, and is replaced after being cast off or\r\nabsorbed.[35] I presume that no physiologist doubts that, for instance,\r\neach bone-corpuscle of the finger differs from the corresponding\r\ncorpuscle in the corresponding joint of the toe; and there can hardly\r\nbe a doubt that even those on the corresponding sides of the body\r\ndiffer, though almost identical in nature. This near approach to\r\nidentity is curiously shown in many diseases in which the same exact\r\npoints on the right and left sides of the body are similarly affected;\r\nthus Sir J. Paget[36] gives a drawing of a diseased pelvis, in which\r\nthe bone has grown into a most complicated pattern, but “there is not\r\none spot or line on one side which is not represented, as exactly as it\r\nwould be in a mirror, on the other.”\r\n\r\nMany facts support this view of the independent life of each minute\r\nelement of the body. Virchow insists that a single bone-corpuscle or a\r\nsingle cell in the skin may become diseased. The spur of a cock, after\r\nbeing inserted into the ear of an ox, lived for eight years, and\r\nacquired a weight of 396 grammes (nearly fourteen ounces), and the\r\nastonishing length of twenty-four centimetres, or about nine inches; so\r\nthat the head of the ox appeared to bear three horns.[37] The tail of a\r\npig has been grafted into the middle of its back, and reacquired\r\nsensibility. Dr. Ollier[38] inserted a piece of periosteum from the\r\nbone of a young dog under the skin of a rabbit, and true bone was\r\ndeveloped. A multitude of similar facts could be given. The frequent\r\npresence of hairs and of perfectly developed teeth, even teeth of the\r\nsecond dentition, in ovarian tumours,[39] are facts leading to the same\r\nconclusion. Mr. Lawson Tait refers to a tumour in which “over 300 teeth\r\nwere found, resembling in many respects milk-teeth;” and to another\r\ntumour, “full of hair which had grown and been shed from one little\r\nspot of skin not bigger than the tip of my little finger. The amount of\r\nhair in the sac, had it grown from a similarly sized area of the scalp,\r\nwould have taken almost a lifetime to grow and be shed.”\r\n\r\nWhether each of the innumerable autonomous elements of the body is a\r\ncell or the modified product of a cell, is a more doubtful question,\r\neven if so wide a definition be given to the term, as to include\r\ncell-like bodies without walls and without nuclei.[40] The doctrine of\r\n_omnis cellula e cellulâ_ is admitted for plants, and widely prevails\r\nwith respect to animals.[41] Thus Virchow, the great supporter of the\r\ncellular theory, whilst allowing that difficulties exist, maintains\r\nthat every atom of tissue is derived from cells, and these from\r\npre-existing cells, and these primarily from the egg, which he regards\r\nas a great cell. That cells, still retaining the same nature, increase\r\nby self-division or proliferation, is admitted by every one. But when\r\nan organism undergoes great changes of structure during development,\r\nthe cells, which at each stage are supposed to be directly derived from\r\npreviously existing cells, must likewise be greatly changed in nature;\r\nthis change is attributed by the supporters of the cellular doctrine to\r\nsome inherent power which the cells possess, and not to any external\r\nagency. Others maintain that cells and tissues of all kinds may be\r\nformed, independently of pre-existing cells, from plastic lymph or\r\nblastema. Whichever view may be correct, every one admits that the body\r\nconsists of a multitude of organic units, all of which possess their\r\nown proper attributes, and are to a certain extent independent of all\r\nothers. Hence it will be convenient to use indifferently the terms\r\ncells or organic units, or simply units.\r\n\r\n_Variability and Inheritance._—We have seen in the twenty-second\r\nchapter that variability is not a principle co-ordinate with life or\r\nreproduction, but results from special causes, generally from changed\r\nconditions acting during successive generations. The fluctuating\r\nvariability thus induced is apparently due in part to the sexual system\r\nbeing easily affected, so that it is often rendered impotent; and when\r\nnot so seriously affected, it often fails in its proper function of\r\ntransmitting truly the characters of the parents to the offspring. But\r\nvariability is not necessarily connected with the sexual system, as we\r\nsee in the cases of bud-variation. Although we are seldom able to trace\r\nthe nature of the connection, many deviations of structure no doubt\r\nresult from changed conditions acting directly on the organisation,\r\nindependently of the reproductive system. In some instances we may feel\r\nsure of this, when all, or nearly all the individuals which have been\r\nsimilarly exposed are similarly and definitely affected, of which\r\nseveral instances have been given. But it is by no means clear why the\r\noffspring should be affected by the exposure of the parents to new\r\nconditions, and why it is necessary in most cases that several\r\ngenerations should have been thus exposed.\r\n\r\nHow, again, can we explain the inherited effects of the use or disuse\r\nof particular organs? The domesticated duck flies less and walks more\r\nthan the wild duck, and its limb-bones have become diminished and\r\nincreased in a corresponding manner in comparison with those of the\r\nwild duck. A horse is trained to certain paces, and the colt inherits\r\nsimilar consensual movements. The domesticated rabbit becomes tame from\r\nclose confinement; the dog, intelligent from associating with man; the\r\nretriever is taught to fetch and carry; and these mental endowments and\r\nbodily powers are all inherited. Nothing in the whole circuit of\r\nphysiology is more wonderful. How can the use or disuse of a particular\r\nlimb or of the brain affect a small aggregate of reproductive cells,\r\nseated in a distant part of the body, in such a manner that the being\r\ndeveloped from these cells inherits the characters of either one or\r\nboth parents? Even an imperfect answer to this question would be\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters devoted to inheritance it was shown that a multitude of\r\nnewly acquired characters, whether injurious or beneficial, whether of\r\nthe lowest or highest vital importance, are often faithfully\r\ntransmitted—frequently even when one parent alone possesses some new\r\npeculiarity; and we may on the whole conclude that inheritance is the\r\nrule, and non-inheritance the anomaly. In some instances a character is\r\nnot inherited, from the conditions of life being directly opposed to\r\nits development; in many instances, from the conditions incessantly\r\ninducing fresh variability, as with grafted fruit-trees and\r\nhighly-cultivated flowers. In the remaining cases the failure may be\r\nattributed to reversion, by which the child resembles its grandparents\r\nor more remote progenitors, instead of its parents.\r\n\r\nInheritance is governed by various laws. Characters which first appear\r\nat any particular age tend to reappear at a corresponding age. They\r\noften become associated with certain seasons of the year, and reappear\r\nin the offspring at a corresponding season. If they appear rather late\r\nin life in one sex, they tend to reappear exclusively in the same sex\r\nat the same period of life.\r\n\r\nThe principle of reversion, recently alluded to, is one of the most\r\nwonderful of the attributes of Inheritance. It proves to us that the\r\ntransmission of a character and its development, which ordinarily go\r\ntogether and thus escape discrimination, are distinct powers; and these\r\npowers in some cases are even antagonistic, for each acts alternately\r\nin successive generations. Reversion is not a rare event, depending on\r\nsome unusual or favourable combination of circumstances, but occurs so\r\nregularly with crossed animals and plants, and so frequently with\r\nuncrossed breeds, that it is evidently an essential part of the\r\nprinciple of inheritance. We know that changed conditions have the\r\npower of evoking long-lost characters, as in the case of animals\r\nbecoming feral. The act of crossing in itself possesses this power in a\r\nhigh degree. What can be more wonderful than that characters, which\r\nhave disappeared during scores, or hundreds, or even thousands of\r\ngenerations, should suddenly reappear perfectly developed, as in the\r\ncase of pigeons and fowls, both when purely bred and especially when\r\ncrossed; or as with the zebrine stripes on dun-coloured horses, and\r\nother such cases? Many monstrosities come under this same head, as when\r\nrudimentary organs are redeveloped, or when an organ which we must\r\nbelieve was possessed by an early progenitor of the species, but of\r\nwhich not even a rudiment is left, suddenly reappears, as with the\r\nfifth stamen in some Scrophulariaceæ. We have already seen that\r\nreversion acts in bud-reproduction; and we know that it occasionally\r\nacts during the growth of the same individual animal, especially, but\r\nnot exclusively, if of crossed parentage,—as in the rare cases\r\ndescribed of fowls, pigeons, cattle, and rabbits, which have reverted\r\nto the colours of one of their parents or ancestors as they advanced in\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWe are led to believe, as formerly explained, that every character\r\nwhich occasionally reappears is present in a latent form in each\r\ngeneration, in nearly the same manner as in male and female animals the\r\nsecondary characters of the opposite sex lie latent and ready to be\r\nevolved when the reproductive organs are injured. This comparison of\r\nthe secondary sexual characters which lie latent in both sexes, with\r\nother latent characters, is the more appropriate from the case recorded\r\nof a Hen, which assumed some of the masculine characters, not of her\r\nown race, but of an early progenitor; she thus exhibited at the same\r\ntime the redevelopment of latent characters of both kinds. In every\r\nliving creature we may feel assured that a host of long-lost characters\r\nlie ready to be evolved under proper conditions. How can we make\r\nintelligible and connect with other facts, this wonderful and common\r\ncapacity of reversion,—this power of calling back to life long-lost\r\ncharacters?\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nI have now enumerated the chief facts which every one would desire to\r\nsee connected by some intelligible bond. This can be done, if we make\r\nthe following assumptions, and much may be advanced in favour of the\r\nchief one. The secondary assumptions can likewise be supported by\r\nvarious physiological considerations. It is universally admitted that\r\nthe cells or units of the body increase by self-division or\r\nproliferation, retaining the same nature, and that they ultimately\r\nbecome converted into the various tissues and substances of the body.\r\nBut besides this means of increase I assume that the units throw off\r\nminute granules which are dispersed throughout the whole system; that\r\nthese, when supplied with proper nutriment, multiply by self-division,\r\nand are ultimately developed into units like those from which they were\r\noriginally derived. These granules may be called gemmules. They are\r\ncollected from all parts of the system to constitute the sexual\r\nelements, and their development in the next generation forms a new\r\nbeing; but they are likewise capable of transmission in a dormant state\r\nto future generations and may then be developed. Their development\r\ndepends on their union with other partially developed or nascent cells\r\nwhich precede them in the regular course of growth. Why I use the term\r\nunion, will be seen when we discuss the direct action of pollen on the\r\ntissues of the mother-plant. Gemmules are supposed to be thrown off by\r\nevery unit, not only during the adult state, but during each stage of\r\ndevelopment of every organism; but not necessarily during the continued\r\nexistence of the same unit. Lastly, I assume that the gemmules in their\r\ndormant state have a mutual affinity for each other, leading to their\r\naggregation into buds or into the sexual elements. Hence, it is not the\r\nreproductive organs or buds which generate new organisms, but the units\r\nof which each individual is composed. These assumptions constitute the\r\nprovisional hypothesis which I have called Pangenesis. Views in many\r\nrespects similar have been propounded by various authors.[42]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to show, firstly, how far these assumptions are in\r\nthemselves probable, and secondly, how far they connect and explain the\r\nvarious groups of facts with which we are concerned, it may be useful\r\nto give an illustration, as simple as possible, of the hypothesis. If\r\none of the Protozoa be formed, as it appears under the microscope, of a\r\nsmall mass of homogeneous gelatinous matter, a minute particle or\r\ngemmule thrown off from any part and nourished under favourable\r\ncircumstances would reproduce the whole; but if the upper and lower\r\nsurfaces were to differ in texture from each other and from the central\r\nportion, then all three parts would have to throw off gemmules, which\r\nwhen aggregated by mutual affinity would form either buds or the sexual\r\nelements, and would ultimately be developed into a similar organism.\r\nPrecisely the same view may be extended to one of the higher animals;\r\nalthough in this case many thousand gemmules must be thrown off from\r\nthe various parts of the body at each stage of development; these\r\ngemmules being developed in union with pre-existing nascent cells in\r\ndue order of succession.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists maintain, as we have seen, that each unit of the body,\r\nthough to a large extent dependent on others, is likewise to a certain\r\nextent independent or autonomous, and has the power of increasing by\r\nself-division. I go one step further, and assume that each unit casts\r\noff free gemmules which are dispersed throughout the system, and are\r\ncapable under proper conditions of being developed into similar units.\r\nNor can this assumption be considered as gratuitous and improbable. It\r\nis manifest that the sexual elements and buds include formative matter\r\nof some kind, capable of development; and we now know from the\r\nproduction of graft-hybrids that similar matter is dispersed throughout\r\nthe tissues of plants, and can combine with that of another and\r\ndistinct plant, giving rise to a new being, intermediate in character.\r\nWe know also that the male element can act directly on the partially\r\ndeveloped tissues of the mother-plant, and on the future progeny of\r\nfemale animals. The formative matter which is thus dispersed throughout\r\nthe tissues of plants, and which is capable of being developed into\r\neach unit or part, must be generated there by some means; and my chief\r\nassumption is that this matter consists of minute particles or gemmules\r\ncast off from each unit or cell.[43]\r\n\r\nBut I have further to assume that the gemmules in their undeveloped\r\nstate are capable of largely multiplying themselves by self-division,\r\nlike independent organisms. Delpino insists that to “admit of\r\nmultiplication by fissiparity in corpuscles, analogous to seeds or buds\r\n. . . is repugnant to all analogy.” But this seems a strange objection,\r\nas Thuret[44] has seen the zoospore of an alga divide itself, and each\r\nhalf germinated. Haeckel divided the segmented ovum of a siphonophora\r\ninto many pieces, and these were developed. Nor does the extreme\r\nminuteness of the gemmules, which can hardly differ much in nature from\r\nthe lowest and simplest organisms, render it improbable that they\r\nshould grow and multiply. A great authority, Dr. Beale,[45] says “that\r\nminute yeast cells are capable of throwing off buds or gemmules, much\r\nless than the 1/100000 of an inch in diameter;” and these he thinks are\r\n“capable of subdivision practically ad infinitum.”\r\n\r\nA particle of small-pox matter, so minute as to be borne by the wind,\r\nmust multiply itself many thousandfold in a person thus inoculated; and\r\nso with the contagious matter of scarlet fever.[46] It has recently\r\nbeen ascertained[47] that a minute portion of the mucous discharge from\r\nan animal affected with rinderpest, if placed in the blood of a healthy\r\nox, increases so fast that in a short space of time “the whole mass of\r\nblood, weighing many pounds, is infected, and every small particle of\r\nthat blood contains enough poison to give, within less than forty-eight\r\nhours, the disease to another animal.”\r\n\r\nThe retention of free and undeveloped gemmules in the same body from\r\nearly youth to old age will appear improbable, but we should remember\r\nhow long seeds lie dormant in the earth and buds in the bark of a tree.\r\nTheir transmission from generation to generation will appear still more\r\nimprobable; but here again we should remember that many rudimentary and\r\nuseless organs have been transmitted during an indefinite number of\r\ngenerations. We shall presently see how well the long-continued\r\ntransmission of undeveloped gemmules explains many facts.\r\n\r\nAs each unit, or group of similar units, throughout the body, casts off\r\nits gemmules, and as all are contained within the smallest ovule, and\r\nwithin each spermatozoon or pollen-grain, and as some animals and\r\nplants produce an astonishing number of pollen-grains and ovules,[48]\r\nthe number and minuteness of the gemmules must be something\r\ninconceivable. But considering how minute the molecules are, and how\r\nmany go to the formation of the smallest granule of any ordinary\r\nsubstance, this difficulty with respect to the gemmules is not\r\ninsuperable. From the data arrived at by Sir W. Thomson, my son George\r\nfinds that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch of glass or water must consist\r\nof between 16 million millions, and 131 thousand million million\r\nmolecules. No doubt the molecules of which an organism is formed are\r\nlarger, from being more complex, than those of an inorganic substance,\r\nand probably many molecules go to the formation of a gemmule; but when\r\nwe bear in mind that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch is much smaller than\r\nany pollen-grain, ovule or bud, we can see what a vast number of\r\ngemmules one of these bodies might contain.\r\n\r\nThe gemmules derived from each part or organ must be thoroughly\r\ndispersed throughout the whole system. We know, for instance, that even\r\na minute fragment of a leaf of a Begonia will reproduce the whole\r\nplant; and that if a fresh-water worm is chopped into small pieces,\r\neach will reproduce the whole animal. Considering also the minuteness\r\nof the gemmules and the permeability of all organic tissues, the\r\nthorough dispersion of the gemmules is not surprising. That matter may\r\nbe readily transferred without the aid of vessels from part to part of\r\nthe body, we have a good instance in a case recorded by Sir J. Paget of\r\na lady, whose hair lost its colour at each successive attack of\r\nneuralgia and recovered it again in the course of a few days. With\r\nplants, however, and probably with compound animals, such as corals,\r\nthe gemmules do not ordinarily spread from bud to bud, but are confined\r\nto the parts developed from each separate bud; and of this fact no\r\nexplanation can be given.\r\n\r\nThe assumed elective affinity of each gemmule for that particular cell\r\nwhich precedes it in due order of development is supported by many\r\nanalogies. In all ordinary cases of sexual reproduction, the male and\r\nfemale elements certainly have a mutual affinity for each other: thus,\r\nit is believed that about ten thousand species of Compositæ exist, and\r\nthere can be no doubt that if the pollen of all these species could be\r\nsimultaneously or successively placed on the stigma of any one species,\r\nthis one would elect with unerring certainty its own pollen. This\r\nelective capacity is all the more wonderful, as it must have been\r\nacquired since the many species of this great group of plants branched\r\noff from a common progenitor. On any view of the nature of sexual\r\nreproduction, the formative matter of each part contained within the\r\novules and the male element act on each other by some law of special\r\naffinity, so that corresponding parts affect one another; thus, a calf\r\nproduced from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull has its horns\r\naffected by the union of the two forms, and the offspring from two\r\nbirds with differently coloured tails have their tails affected.\r\n\r\nThe various tissues of the body plainly show, as many physiologists\r\nhave insisted,[49] an affinity for special organic substances, whether\r\nnatural or foreign to the body. We see this in the cells of the kidneys\r\nattracting urea from the blood; in curare affecting certain nerves;\r\n_Lytta vesicatoria_ the kidneys; and the poisonous matter of various\r\ndiseases, as small-pox, scarlet-fever, hooping-cough, glanders, and\r\nhydrophobia, affecting certain definite parts of the body.\r\n\r\nIt has also been assumed that the development of each gemmule depends\r\non its union with another cell or unit which has just commenced its\r\ndevelopment, and which precedes it in due order of growth. That the\r\nformative matter within the pollen of plants, which by our hypothesis\r\nconsists of gemmules, can unite with and modify the partially developed\r\ncells of the mother-plant, we have clearly seen in the section devoted\r\nto this subject. As the tissues of plants are formed, as far as is\r\nknown, only by the proliferation of pre-existing cells, we must\r\nconclude that the gemmules derived from the foreign pollen do not\r\nbecome developed into new and separate cells, but penetrate and modify\r\nthe nascent cells of the mother-plant. This process may be compared\r\nwith what takes place in the act of ordinary fertilisation, during\r\nwhich the contents of the pollen-tubes penetrate the closed embryonic\r\nsac within the ovule, and determine the development of the embryo.\r\nAccording to this view, the cells of the mother-plant may almost\r\nliterally be said to be fertilised by the gemmules derived from the\r\nforeign pollen. In this case and in all others the proper gemmules must\r\ncombine in due order with pre-existing nascent cells, owing to their\r\nelective affinities. A slight difference in nature between the gemmules\r\nand the nascent cells would be far from interfering with their mutual\r\nunion and development, for we well know in the case of ordinary\r\nreproduction that such slight differentiation in the sexual elements\r\nfavours in a marked manner their union and subsequent development, as\r\nwell as the vigour of the offspring thus produced.\r\n\r\nThus far we have been able by the aid of our hypothesis to throw some\r\nobscure light on the problems which have come before us; but it must be\r\nconfessed that many points remain altogether doubtful. Thus it is\r\nuseless to speculate at what period of development each unit of the\r\nbody casts off its gemmules, as the whole subject of the development of\r\nthe various tissues is as yet far from clear. We do not know whether\r\nthe gemmules are merely collected by some unknown means at certain\r\nseasons within the reproductive organs, or whether after being thus\r\ncollected they rapidly multiply there, as the flow of blood to these\r\norgans at each breeding season seems to render probable. Nor do we know\r\nwhy the gemmules collect to form buds in certain definite places,\r\nleading to the symmetrical growth of trees and corals. We have no means\r\nof deciding whether the ordinary wear and tear of the tissues is made\r\ngood by means of gemmules, or merely by the proliferation of\r\npre-existing cells. If the gemmules are thus consumed, as seems\r\nprobable from the intimate connection between the repair of waste,\r\nre-growth, and development, and more especially from the periodical\r\nchanges which many male animals undergo in colour and structure, then\r\nsome light would be thrown on the phenomena of old age, with its\r\nlessened power of reproduction and of the repair of injuries, and on\r\nthe obscure subject of longevity. The fact of castrated animals, which\r\ndo not cast off innumerable gemmules in the act of reproduction, not\r\nbeing longer-lived than perfect males, seems opposed to the belief that\r\ngemmules are consumed in the ordinary repair of wasted tissues; unless\r\nindeed the gemmules after being collected in small numbers within the\r\nreproductive organs are there largely multiplied.[50]\r\n\r\nThat the same cells or units may live for a long period and continue\r\nmultiplying without being modified by their union with free gemmules of\r\nany kind, is probable from such cases as that of the spur of a cock\r\nwhich grew to an enormous size when grafted into the ear of an ox. How\r\nfar units are modified during their normal growth by absorbing peculiar\r\nnutriment from the surrounding tissues, independently of their union\r\nwith gemmules of a distinct nature, is another doubtful point.[51] We\r\nshall appreciate this difficulty by calling to mind what complex yet\r\nsymmetrical growths the cells of plants yield when inoculated by the\r\npoison of a gall-insect. With animals various polypoid excrescences and\r\ntumours are generally admitted[52] to be the direct product, through\r\nproliferation, of normal cells which have become abnormal. In the\r\nregular growth and repair of bones, the tissues undergo, as Virchow\r\nremarks,[53] a whole series of permutations and substitutions. “The\r\ncartilage cells may be converted by a direct transformation into\r\nmarrow-cells, and continue as such; or they may first be converted into\r\nosseous and then into medullary tissue; or lastly, they may first be\r\nconverted into marrow and then into bone. So variable are the\r\npermutations of these tissues, in themselves so nearly allied, and yet\r\nin their external appearance so completely distinct.” But as these\r\ntissues thus change their nature at any age, without any obvious change\r\nin their nutrition, we must suppose in accordance with our hypothesis\r\nthat gemmules derived from one kind of tissue combine with the cells of\r\nanother kind, and cause the successive modifications.\r\n\r\nWe have good reason to believe that several gemmules are requisite for\r\nthe development of one and the same unit or cell; for we cannot\r\notherwise understand the insufficiency of a single or even of two or\r\nthree pollen-grains or spermatozoa. But we are far from knowing whether\r\nthe gemmules of all the units are free and separate from one another,\r\nor whether some are from the first united into small aggregates. A\r\nfeather, for instance, is a complex structure, and, as each separate\r\npart is liable to inherited variations, I conclude that each feather\r\ngenerates a large number of gemmules; but it is possible that these may\r\nbe aggregated into a compound gemmule. The same remark applies to the\r\npetals of flowers, which are sometimes highly complex structures, with\r\neach ridge and hollow contrived for a special purpose, so that each\r\npart must have been separately modified, and the modifications\r\ntransmitted; consequently, separate gemmules, according to our\r\nhypothesis, must have been thrown off from each cell or unit. But, as\r\nwe sometimes see half an anther or a small portion of a filament\r\nbecoming petali-form, or parts or mere stripes of the calyx assuming\r\nthe colour and texture of the corolla, it is probable that with petals\r\nthe gemmules of each cell are not aggregated together into a compound\r\ngemmule, but are free and separate. Even in so simple a case as that of\r\na perfect cell, with its protoplasmic contents, nucleus, nucleolus, and\r\nwalls, we do not know whether or not its development depends on a\r\ncompound gemmule derived from each part.[54]\r\n\r\nHaving now endeavoured to show that the several foregoing assumptions\r\nare to a certain extent supported by analogous facts, and having\r\nalluded to some of the most doubtful points, we will consider how far\r\nthe hypothesis brings under a single point of view the various cases\r\nenumerated in the First Part. All the forms of reproduction graduate\r\ninto one another and agree in their product; for it is impossible to\r\ndistinguish between organisms produced from buds, from self-division,\r\nor from fertilised germs; such organisms are liable to variations of\r\nthe same nature and to reversions of the same kind; and as, according\r\nto our hypothesis, all the forms of reproduction depend on the\r\naggregation of gemmules derived from the whole body, we can understand\r\nthis remarkable agreement. Parthenogenesis is no longer wonderful, and\r\nif we did not know that great good followed from the union of the\r\nsexual elements derived from two distinct individuals, the wonder would\r\nbe that parthenogenesis did not occur much oftener than it does. On any\r\nordinary theory of reproduction the formation of graft-hybrids, and the\r\naction of the male element on the tissues of the mother-plant, as well\r\nas on the future progeny of female animals, are great anomalies; but\r\nthey are intelligible on our hypothesis. The reproductive organs do not\r\nactually create the sexual elements; they merely determine the\r\naggregation and perhaps the multiplication of the gemmules in a special\r\nmanner. These organs, however, together with their accessory parts,\r\nhave high functions to perform. They adapt one or both elements for\r\nindependent temporary existence, and for mutual union. The stigmatic\r\nsecretion acts on the pollen of a plant of the same species in a wholly\r\ndifferent manner to what it does on the pollen of one belonging to a\r\ndistinct genus or family. The spermatophores of the Cephalopoda are\r\nwonderfully complex structures, which were formerly mistaken for\r\nparasitic worms; and the spermatozoa of some animals possess attributes\r\nwhich, if observed in an independent animal, would be put down to\r\ninstinct guided by sense-organs,—as when the spermatozoa of an insect\r\nfind their way into the minute micropyle of the egg.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism which has long been observed,[55] with certain\r\nexceptions, between growth and the power of sexual\r\nreproduction[56]—between the repair of injuries and gemmation—and with\r\nplants, between rapid increase by buds, rhizomes, etc., and the\r\nproduction of seed, is partly explained by the gemmules not existing in\r\nsufficient numbers for these processes to be carried on simultaneously.\r\n\r\nHardly any fact in physiology is more wonderful than the power of\r\nre-growth; for instance, that a snail should be able to reproduce its\r\nhead, or a salamander its eyes, tail, and legs, exactly at the points\r\nwhere they have been cut off. Such cases are explained by the presence\r\nof gemmules derived from each part, and disseminated throughout the\r\nbody. I have heard the process compared with that of the repair of the\r\nbroken angles of a crystal by re-crystallisation; and the two processes\r\nhave this much in common, that in the one case the polarity of the\r\nmolecules is the efficient cause, and in the other the affinity of the\r\ngemmules for particular nascent cells. But we have here to encounter\r\ntwo objections which apply not only to the re-growth of a part, or of a\r\nbisected individual, but to fissiparous generation and budding. The\r\nfirst objection is that the part which is reproduced is in the same\r\nstage of development as that of the being which has been operated on or\r\nbisected; and in the case of buds, that the new beings thus produced\r\nare in the same stage as that of the budding parent. Thus a mature\r\nsalamander, of which the tail has been cut off, does not reproduce a\r\nlarval tail; and a crab does not reproduce a larval leg. In the case of\r\nbudding it was shown in the first part of this chapter that the new\r\nbeing thus produced does not retrograde in development,—that is, does\r\nnot pass through those earlier stages, which the fertilised germ has to\r\npass through. Nevertheless, the organisms operated on or multiplying\r\nthemselves by buds must, by our hypothesis, include innumerable\r\ngemmules derived from every part or unit of the earlier stages of\r\ndevelopment; and why do not such gemmules reproduce the amputated part\r\nor the whole body at a corresponding early stage of development?\r\n\r\nThe second objection, which has been insisted on by Delpino, is that\r\nthe tissues, for instance, of a mature salamander or crab, of which a\r\nlimb has been removed, are already differentiated and have passed\r\nthrough their whole course of development; and how can such tissues in\r\naccordance with our hypothesis attract and combine with the gemmules of\r\nthe part which is to be reproduced? In answer to these two objections\r\nwe must bear in mind the evidence which has been advanced, showing that\r\nat least in a large number of cases the power of re-growth is a\r\nlocalised faculty, acquired for the sake of repairing special injuries\r\nto which each particular creature is liable; and in the case of buds or\r\nfissiparous generation, for the sake of quickly multiplying the\r\norganism at a period of life when it can be supported in large numbers.\r\nThese considerations lead us to believe that in all such cases a stock\r\nof nascent cells or of partially developed gemmules are retained for\r\nthis special purpose either locally or throughout the body, ready to\r\ncombine with the gemmules derived from the cells which come next in due\r\nsuccession. If this be admitted we have a sufficient answer to the\r\nabove two objections. Anyhow, pangenesis seems to throw a considerable\r\namount of light on the wonderful power of re-growth.\r\n\r\nIt follows, also, from the view just given, that the sexual elements\r\ndiffer from buds in not including nascent cells or gemmules in a\r\nsomewhat advanced stage of development, so that only the gemmules\r\nbelonging to the earliest stages are first developed. As young animals\r\nand those which stand low in the scale generally have a much greater\r\ncapacity for re-growth than older and higher animals, it would also\r\nappear that they retain cells in a nascent state, or partially\r\ndeveloped gemmules, more readily than do animals which have already\r\npassed through a long series of developmental changes. I may here add\r\nthat although ovules can be detected in most or all female animals at\r\nan extremely early age, there is no reason to doubt that gemmules\r\nderived from parts modified during maturity can pass into the ovules.\r\n\r\nWith respect to hybridism, pangenesis agrees well with most of the\r\nascertained facts. We must believe, as previously shown, that several\r\ngemmules are requisite for the development of each cell or unit. But\r\nfrom the occurrence of parthenogenesis, more especially from those\r\ncases in which an embryo is only partially formed, we may infer that\r\nthe female element generally includes gemmules in nearly sufficient\r\nnumber for independent development, so that when united with the male\r\nelement the gemmules are superabundant. Now, when two species or races\r\nare crossed reciprocally, the offspring do not commonly differ, and\r\nthis shows that the sexual elements agree in power, in accordance with\r\nthe view that both include the same gemmules. Hybrids and mongrels are\r\nalso generally intermediate in character between the two parent-forms,\r\nyet occasionally they closely resemble one parent in one part and the\r\nother parent in another part, or even in their whole structure: nor is\r\nthis difficult to understand on the admission that the gemmules in the\r\nfertilised germ are superabundant in number, and that those derived\r\nfrom one parent may have some advantage in number, affinity, or vigour\r\nover those derived from the other parent. Crossed forms sometimes\r\nexhibit the colour or other characters of either parent in stripes or\r\nblotches; and this occurs in the first generation, or through reversion\r\nin succeeding bud and seminal generations, of which fact several\r\ninstances were given in the eleventh chapter. In these cases we must\r\nfollow Naudin[57] and admit that the “essence” or “element” of the two\r\nspecies,—terms which I should translate into the gemmules,—have an\r\naffinity for their own kind, and thus separate themselves into distinct\r\nstripes or blotches; and reasons were given, when discussing in the\r\nfifteenth chapter the incompatibility of certain characters to unite,\r\nfor believing in such mutual affinity. When two forms are crossed, one\r\nis not rarely found to be prepotent in the transmission of its\r\ncharacters over the other; and this we can explain by again assuming\r\nthat the one form has some advantage over the other in the number,\r\nvigour, or affinity of its gemmules. In some cases, however, certain\r\ncharacters are present in the one form and latent in the other; for\r\ninstance, there is a latent tendency in all pigeons to become blue,\r\nand, when a blue pigeon is crossed with one of any other colour, the\r\nblue tint is generally prepotent. The explanation of this form of\r\nprepotency will be obvious when we come to the consideration of\r\nReversion.\r\n\r\nWhen two distinct species are crossed, it is notorious that they do not\r\nyield the full or proper number of offspring; and we can only say on\r\nthis head that, as the development of each organism depends on such\r\nnicely-balanced affinities between a host of gemmules and nascent\r\ncells, we need not feel at all surprised that the commixture of\r\ngemmules derived from two distinct species should lead to partial or\r\ncomplete failure of development. With respect to the sterility of\r\nhybrids produced from the union of two distinct species, it was shown\r\nin the nineteenth chapter that this depends exclusively on the\r\nreproductive organs being specially affected; but why these organs\r\nshould be thus affected we do not know, any more than why unnatural\r\nconditions of life, though compatible with health, should cause\r\nsterility; or why continued close interbreeding, or the illegitimate\r\nunions of heterostyled plants, induce the same result. The conclusion\r\nthat the reproductive organs alone are affected, and not the whole\r\norganisation, agrees perfectly with the unimpaired or even increased\r\ncapacity in hybrid plants for propagation by buds; for this implies,\r\naccording to our hypothesis, that the cells of the hybrids throw off\r\nhybridised gemmules, which become aggregated into buds, but fail to\r\nbecome aggregated within the reproductive organs, so as to form the\r\nsexual elements. In a similar manner many plants, when placed under\r\nunnatural conditions, fail to produce seed, but can readily be\r\npropagated by buds. We shall presently see that pangenesis agrees well\r\nwith the strong tendency to reversion exhibited by all crossed animals\r\nand plants.\r\n\r\nEach organism reaches maturity through a longer or shorter course of\r\ngrowth and development: the former term being confined to mere increase\r\nof size, and development to changed structure. The changes may be small\r\nand insensibly slow, as when a child grows into a man, or many, abrupt,\r\nand slight, as in the metamorphoses of certain ephemerous insects, or,\r\nagain, few and strongly-marked, as with most other insects. Each newly\r\nformed part may be moulded within a previously existing and\r\ncorresponding part, and in this case it will appear, falsely as I\r\nbelieve, to be developed from the old part; or it may be formed within\r\na distinct part of the body, as in the extreme cases of metagenesis. An\r\neye, for instance, may be developed at a spot where no eye previously\r\nexisted. We have also seen that allied organic beings in the course of\r\ntheir metamorphoses sometimes attain nearly the same structure after\r\npassing through widely different forms; or conversely, after passing\r\nthrough nearly the same early forms, arrive at widely different mature\r\nforms. In these cases it is very difficult to accept the common view\r\nthat the first-formed cells or units possess the inherent power,\r\nindependently of any external agency, of producing new structures\r\nwholly different in form, position, and function. But all these cases\r\nbecome plain on the hypothesis of pangenesis. The units, during each\r\nstage of development, throw off gemmules, which, multiplying, are\r\ntransmitted to the offspring. In the offspring, as soon as any\r\nparticular cell or unit becomes partially developed, it unites with\r\n(or, to speak metaphorically, is fertilised by) the gemmule of the next\r\nsucceeding cell, and so onwards. But organisms have often been\r\nsubjected to changed conditions of life at a certain stage of their\r\ndevelopment, and in consequence have been slightly modified; and the\r\ngemmules cast off from such modified parts will tend to reproduce parts\r\nmodified in the same manner. This process may be repeated until the\r\nstructure of the part becomes greatly changed at one particular stage\r\nof development, but this will not necessarily affect other parts,\r\nwhether previously or subsequently formed. In this manner we can\r\nunderstand the remarkable independence of structure in the successive\r\nmetamorphoses, and especially in the successive metageneses of many\r\nanimals. In the case, however, of diseases which supervene during old\r\nage, subsequently to the ordinary period of procreation, and which,\r\nnevertheless, are sometimes inherited, as occurs with brain and heart\r\ncomplaints, we must suppose that the organs were affected at an early\r\nage and threw off at this period affected gemmules; but that the\r\naffection became visible or injurious only after the prolonged growth,\r\nin the strict sense of the word, of the part. In all the changes of\r\nstructure which regularly supervene during old age, we probably see the\r\neffects of deteriorated growth, and not of true development.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the independent formation of each part, owing to the\r\nunion of the proper gemmules with certain nascent cells, together with\r\nthe superabundance of the gemmules derived from both parents, and the\r\nsubsequent self-multiplication of the gemmules, throws light on a\r\nwidely different group of facts, which on any ordinary view of\r\ndevelopment appears very strange. I allude to organs which are\r\nabnormally transposed or multiplied. For instance, a curious case has\r\nbeen recorded by Dr. Elliott Coues[58] of a monstrous chicken with a\r\nperfect additional _right_ leg articulated to the _left_ side of the\r\npelvis. Gold-fish often have supernumerary fins placed on various parts\r\nof their bodies. When the tail of a lizard is broken off, a double tail\r\nis sometimes reproduced; and when the foot of the salamander was\r\ndivided longitudinally by Bonnet, additional digits were occasionally\r\nformed. Valentin injured the caudal extremity of an embryo, and three\r\ndays afterwards it produced rudiments of a double pelvis and of double\r\nhind-limbs.[59] When frogs, toads, etc., are born with their limbs\r\ndoubled, as sometimes happens, the doubling, as Gervais remarks,[60]\r\ncannot be due to the complete fusion of two embryos, with the exception\r\nof the limbs, for the larvæ are limbless. The same argument is\r\napplicable[61] to certain insects produced with multiple legs or\r\nantennæ, for these are metamorphosed from apodal or antennæ-less larvæ.\r\nAlphonse Milne-Edwards[62] has described the curious case of a\r\ncrustacean in which one eye-peduncle supported, instead of a complete\r\neye, only an imperfect cornea, and out of the centre of this a portion\r\nof an antenna was developed. A case has been recorded[63] of a man who\r\nhad during both dentitions a double tooth in place of the left second\r\nincisor, and he inherited this peculiarity from his paternal\r\ngrandfather. Several cases are known[64] of additional teeth having\r\nbeen developed in the orbit of the eye, and, more especially with\r\nhorses, in the palate. Hairs occasionally appear in strange situations,\r\nas “within the substance of the brain.”[65] Certain breeds of sheep\r\nbear a whole crowd of horns on their foreheads. As many as five spurs\r\nhave been seen on both legs of certain Game-fowls. In the Polish fowl\r\nthe male is ornamented with a topknot of hackles like those on his\r\nneck, whilst the female has a top-knot formed of common feathers. In\r\nfeather-footed pigeons and fowls, feathers like those on the wing arise\r\nfrom the outer side of the legs and toes. Even the elemental parts of\r\nthe same feather may be transposed; for in the Sebastopol goose,\r\nbarbules are developed on the divided filaments of the shaft. Imperfect\r\nnails sometimes appear on the stumps of the amputated fingers of\r\nman[66] and it is an interesting fact that with the snake-like\r\nSaurians, which present a series with more and more imperfect limbs,\r\nthe terminations of the phalanges first disappear, “the nails becoming\r\ntransferred to their proximal remnants, or even to parts which are not\r\nphalanges.”[67]\r\n\r\nAnalogous cases are of such frequent occurrence with plants that they\r\ndo not strike us with sufficient surprise. Supernumerary petals,\r\nstamens, and pistils, are often produced. I have seen a leaflet low\r\ndown in the compound leaf of _Vicia sativa_ replaced by a tendril; and\r\na tendril possesses many peculiar properties, such as spontaneous\r\nmovement and irritability. The calyx sometimes assumes, either wholly\r\nor by stripes, the colour and texture of the corolla. Stamens are so\r\nfrequently converted into petals, more or less completely, that such\r\ncases are passed over as not deserving notice; but as petals have\r\nspecial functions to perform, namely, to protect the included organs,\r\nto attract insects, and in not a few cases to guide their entrance by\r\nwell-adapted contrivances, we can hardly account for the conversion of\r\nstamens into petals merely by unnatural or superfluous nourishment.\r\nAgain, the edge of a petal may occasionally be found including one of\r\nthe highest products of the plant, namely, pollen; for instance, I have\r\nseen the pollen-mass of an Ophrys, which is a very complex structure,\r\ndeveloped in the edge of an upper petal. The segments of the calyx of\r\nthe common pea have been observed partially converted into carpels,\r\nincluding ovules, and with their tips converted into stigmas. Mr.\r\nSalter and Dr. Maxwell Masters have found pollen within the ovules of\r\nthe passion-flower and of the rose. Buds may be developed in the most\r\nunnatural positions, as on the petal of a flower. Numerous analogous\r\nfacts could be given.[68]\r\n\r\nI do not know how physiologists look at such facts as the foregoing.\r\nAccording to the doctrine of pangenesis, the gemmules of the transposed\r\norgans become developed in the wrong place, from uniting with wrong\r\ncells or aggregates of cells during their nascent state; and this would\r\nfollow from a slight modification in their elective affinities. Nor\r\nought we to feel much surprise at the affinities of cells and gemmules\r\nvarying, when we remember the many curious cases given in the\r\nseventeenth chapter, of plants which absolutely refuse to be fertilised\r\nby their own pollen, though abundantly fertile with that of any other\r\nindividual of the same species, and in some cases only with that of a\r\ndistinct species. It is manifest that the sexual elective affinities of\r\nsuch plants—to use the term employed by Gärtner—have been modified. As\r\nthe cells of adjoining or homologous parts will have nearly the same\r\nnature, they will be particularly liable to acquire by variation each\r\nother’s elective affinities; and we can thus understand to a certain\r\nextent such cases as a crowd of horns on the heads of certain sheep, of\r\nseveral spurs on the legs of fowls, hackle-like feathers on the heads\r\nof the males of other fowls, and with the pigeon wing-like feathers on\r\ntheir legs and membrane between their toes, for the leg is the\r\nhomologue of the wing. As all the organs of plants are homologous and\r\nspring from a common axis, it is natural that they should be eminently\r\nliable to transposition. It ought to be observed that when any compound\r\npart, such as an additional limb or an antenna, springs from a false\r\nposition, it is only necessary that the few first gemmules should be\r\nwrongly attached; for these whilst developing would attract other\r\ngemmules in due succession, as in the re-growth of an amputated limb.\r\nWhen parts which are homologous and similar in structure, as the\r\nvertebræ of snakes or the stamens of polyandrous flowers, etc., are\r\nrepeated many times in the same organism, closely allied gemmules must\r\nbe extremely numerous, as well as the points to which they ought to\r\nbecome united; and, in accordance with the foregoing views, we can to a\r\ncertain extent understand Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s law, that\r\nparts, which are already multiple, are extremely liable to vary in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nVariability often depends, as I have attempted to show, on the\r\nreproductive organs being injuriously affected by changed conditions;\r\nand in this case the gemmules derived from the various parts of the\r\nbody are probably aggregated in an irregular manner, some superfluous\r\nand others deficient. Whether a superabundance of gemmules would lead\r\nto the increased size of any part cannot be told; but we can see that\r\ntheir partial deficiency, without necessarily leading to the entire\r\nabortion of the part, might cause considerable modifications; for in\r\nthe same manner as plants, if their own pollen be excluded, are easily\r\nhybridised, so, in the case of cells, if the properly succeeding\r\ngemmules were absent, they would probably combine easily with other and\r\nallied gemmules, as we have just seen with transposed parts.\r\n\r\nIn variations caused by the direct action of changed conditions, of\r\nwhich several instances have been given, certain parts of the body are\r\ndirectly affected by the new conditions, and consequently throw off\r\nmodified gemmules, which are transmitted to the offspring. On any\r\nordinary view it is unintelligible how changed conditions, whether\r\nacting on the embryo, the young or the adult, can cause inherited\r\nmodifications. It is equally or even more unintelligible on any\r\nordinary view, how the effects of the long-continued use or disuse of a\r\npart, or of changed habits of body or mind, can be inherited. A more\r\nperplexing problem can hardly be proposed; but on our view we have only\r\nto suppose that certain cells become at last structurally modified; and\r\nthat these throw off similarly modified gemmules. This may occur at any\r\nperiod of development, and the modification will be inherited at a\r\ncorresponding period; for the modified gemmules will unite in all\r\nordinary cases with the proper preceding cells, and will consequently\r\nbe developed at the same period at which the modification first arose.\r\nWith respect to mental habits or instincts, we are so profoundly\r\nignorant of the relation between the brain and the power of thought\r\nthat we do not know positively whether a fixed habit induces any change\r\nin the nervous system, though this seems highly probable; but when such\r\nhabit or other mental attribute, or insanity, is inherited, we must\r\nbelieve that some actual modification is transmitted;[69] and this\r\nimplies, according to our hypothesis, that gemmules derived from\r\nmodified nerve-cells are transmitted to the offspring.\r\n\r\nIt is generally necessary that an organism should be exposed during\r\nseveral generations to changed conditions or habits, in order that any\r\nmodification thus acquired should appear in the offspring. This may be\r\npartly due to the changes not being at first marked enough to catch\r\nattention, but this explanation is insufficient; and I can account for\r\nthe fact only by the assumption, which we shall see under the head of\r\nreversion is strongly supported, that gemmules derived from each\r\nunmodified unit or part are transmitted in large numbers to successive\r\ngenerations, and that the gemmules derived from the same unit after it\r\nhas been modified go on multiplying under the same favourable\r\nconditions which first caused the modification, until at last they\r\nbecome sufficiently numerous to overpower and supplant the old\r\ngemmules.\r\n\r\nA difficulty may be here noticed; we have seen that there is an\r\nimportant difference in the frequency, though not in the nature, of the\r\nvariations in plants propagated by sexual and asexual generation. As\r\nfar as variability depends on the imperfect action of the reproductive\r\norgans under changed conditions, we can at once see why plants\r\npropagated asexually should be far less variable than those propagated\r\nsexually. With respect to the direct action of changed conditions, we\r\nknow that organisms produced from buds do not pass through the earlier\r\nphases of development; they will therefore not be exposed, at that\r\nperiod of life when structure is most readily modified, to the various\r\ncauses inducing variability in the same manner as are embryos and young\r\nlarval forms; but whether this is a sufficient explanation I know not.\r\n\r\nWith respect to variations due to reversion, there is a similar\r\ndifference between plants propagated from buds and seeds. Many\r\nvarieties can be propagated securely by buds, but generally or\r\ninvariably revert to their parent-forms by seed. So, also, hybridised\r\nplants can be multiplied to any extent by buds, but are continually\r\nliable to reversion by seed,—that is, to the loss of their hybrid or\r\nintermediate character. I can offer no satisfactory explanation of\r\nthese facts. Plants with variegated leaves, phloxes with striped\r\nflowers, barberries with seedless fruit, can all be securely propagated\r\nby buds taken from the stem or branches; but buds from the roots of\r\nthese plants almost invariably lose their character and revert to their\r\nformer condition. This latter fact is also inexplicable, unless buds\r\ndeveloped from the roots are as distinct from those on the stem, as is\r\none bud on the stem from another, and we know that these latter behave\r\nlike independent organisms.\r\n\r\nFinally, we see that on the hypothesis of pangenesis variability\r\ndepends on at least two distinct groups of causes. Firstly, the\r\ndeficiency, superabundance, and transposition of gemmules, and the\r\nredevelopment of those which have long been dormant; the gemmules\r\nthemselves not having undergone any modification; and such changes will\r\namply account for much fluctuating variability. Secondly, the direct\r\naction of changed conditions on the organisation, and of the increased\r\nuse or disuse of parts; and in this case the gemmules from the modified\r\nunits will be themselves modified, and, when sufficiently multiplied,\r\nwill supplant the old gemmules and be developed into new structures.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the laws of Inheritance. If we suppose a homogeneous\r\ngelatinous protozoon to vary and assume a reddish colour, a minute\r\nseparated particle would naturally, as it grew to full size, retain the\r\nsame colour; and we should have the simplest form of inheritance.[70]\r\nPrecisely the same view may be extended to the infinitely numerous and\r\ndiversified units of which the whole body of one of the higher animals\r\nis composed; the separated particles being our gemmules. We have\r\nalready sufficiently discussed by implication, the important principle\r\nof inheritance at corresponding ages. Inheritance as limited by sex and\r\nby the season of the year (for instance with animals becoming white in\r\nwinter) is intelligible if we may believe that the elective affinities\r\nof the units of the body are slightly different in the two sexes,\r\nespecially at maturity, and in one or both sexes at different seasons,\r\nso that they unite with different gemmules. It should be remembered\r\nthat, in the discussion on the abnormal transposition of organs, we\r\nhave seen reason to believe that such elective affinities are readily\r\nmodified. But I shall soon have to recur to sexual and seasonal\r\ninheritance. These several laws are therefore explicable to a large\r\nextent through pangenesis, and on no other hypothesis which has as yet\r\nbeen advanced.\r\n\r\nBut it appears at first sight a fatal objection to our hypothesis that\r\na part or organ may be removed during several successive generations,\r\nand if the operation be not followed by disease, the lost part\r\nreappears in the offspring. Dogs and horses formerly had their tails\r\ndocked during many generations without any inherited effect; although,\r\nas we have seen, there is some reason to believe that the tailless\r\ncondition of certain sheep-dogs is due to such inheritance.\r\nCircumcision has been practised by the Jews from a remote period, and\r\nin most cases the effects of the operation are not visible in the\r\noffspring; though some maintain that an inherited effect does\r\noccasionally appear. If inheritance depends on the presence of\r\ndisseminated gemmules derived from all the units of the body, why does\r\nnot the amputation or mutilation of a part, especially if effected on\r\nboth sexes, invariably affect the offspring? The answer in accordance\r\nwith our hypothesis probably is that gemmules multiply and are\r\ntransmitted during a long series of generations—as we see in the\r\nreappearance of zebrine stripes on the horse—in the reappearance of\r\nmuscles and other structures in man which are proper to his lowly\r\norganised progenitors, and in many other such cases. Therefore the\r\nlong-continued inheritance of a part which has been removed during many\r\ngenerations is no real anomaly, for gemmules formerly derived from the\r\npart are multiplied and transmitted from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet spoken only of the removal of parts, when not followed\r\nby morbid action: but when the operation is thus followed, it is\r\ncertain that the deficiency is sometimes inherited. In a former chapter\r\ninstances were given, as of a cow, the loss of whose horn was followed\r\nby suppuration, and her calves were destitute of a horn on the same\r\nside of their heads. But the evidence which admits of no doubt is that\r\ngiven by Brown-Séquard with respect to guinea-pigs, which after their\r\nsciatic nerves had been divided, gnawed off their own gangrenous toes,\r\nand the toes of their offspring were deficient in at least thirteen\r\ninstances on the corresponding feet. The inheritance of the lost part\r\nin several of these cases is all the more remarkable as only one parent\r\nwas affected; but we know that a congenital deficiency is often\r\ntransmitted from one parent alone—for instance, the offspring of\r\nhornless cattle of either sex, when crossed with perfect animals, are\r\noften hornless. How, then, in accordance with our hypothesis can we\r\naccount for mutilations being sometimes strongly inherited, if they are\r\nfollowed by diseased action? The answer probably is that all the\r\ngemmules of the mutilated or amputated part are gradually attracted to\r\nthe diseased surface during the reparative process, and are there\r\ndestroyed by the morbid action.\r\n\r\nA few words must be added on the complete abortion of organs. When a\r\npart becomes diminished by disuse prolonged during many generations,\r\nthe principle of economy of growth, together with intercrossing, will\r\ntend to reduce it still further as previously explained, but this will\r\nnot account for the complete or almost complete obliteration of, for\r\ninstance, a minute papilla of cellular tissue representing a pistil, or\r\nof a microscopically minute nodule of bone representing a tooth. In\r\ncertain cases of suppression not yet completed, in which a rudiment\r\noccasionally reappears through reversion, dispersed gemmules derived\r\nfrom this part must, according to our view, still exist; we must\r\ntherefore suppose that the cells, in union with which the rudiment was\r\nformerly developed, fail in their affinity for such gemmules, except in\r\nthe occasional cases of reversion. But when the abortion is complete\r\nand final, the gemmules themselves no doubt perish; nor is this in any\r\nway improbable, for, though a vast number of active and long-dormant\r\ngemmules are nourished in each living creature, yet there must be some\r\nlimit to their number; and it appears natural that gemmules derived\r\nfrom reduced and useless parts would be more liable to perish than\r\nthose freshly derived from other parts which are still in full\r\nfunctional activity.\r\n\r\nThe last subject that need be discussed, namely, Reversion, rests on\r\nthe principle that transmission and development, though generally\r\nacting in conjunction, are distinct powers; and the transmission of\r\ngemmules with their subsequent development shows us how this is\r\npossible. We plainly see the distinction in the many cases in which a\r\ngrandfather transmits to his grandson, through his daughter, characters\r\nwhich she does not, or cannot, possess. But before proceeding, it will\r\nbe advisable to say a few words about latent or dormant characters.\r\nMost, or perhaps all, of the secondary characters, which appertain to\r\none sex, lie dormant in the other sex; that is, gemmules capable of\r\ndevelopment into the secondary male sexual characters are included\r\nwithin the female; and conversely female characters in the male: we\r\nhave evidence of this in certain masculine characters, both corporeal\r\nand mental, appearing in the female, when her ovaria are diseased or\r\nwhen they fail to act from old age. In like manner female characters\r\nappear in castrated males, as in the shape of the horns of the ox, and\r\nin the absence of horns in castrated stags. Even a slight change in the\r\nconditions of life due to confinement sometimes suffices to prevent the\r\ndevelopment of masculine characters in male animals, although their\r\nreproductive organs are not permanently injured. In the many cases in\r\nwhich masculine characters are periodically renewed, these are latent\r\nat other seasons; inheritance as limited by sex and season being here\r\ncombined. Again, masculine characters generally lie dormant in male\r\nanimals until they arrive at the proper age for reproduction. The\r\ncurious case formerly given of a Hen which assumed the masculine\r\ncharacters, not of her own breed but of a remote progenitor,\r\nillustrates the close connection between latent sexual characters and\r\nordinary reversion.\r\n\r\nWith those animals and plants which habitually produce several forms,\r\nas with certain butterflies described by Mr. Wallace, in which three\r\nfemale forms and one male form co-exist, or, as with the trimorphic\r\nspecies of Lythrum and Oxalis, gemmules capable of reproducing these\r\ndifferent forms must be latent in each individual.\r\n\r\nInsects are occasionally produced with one side or one quarter of their\r\nbodies like that of the male, with the other half or three-quarters\r\nlike that of the female. In such cases the two sides are sometimes\r\nwonderfully different in structure, and are separated from each other\r\nby a sharp line. As gemmules derived from every part are present in\r\neach individual of both sexes, it must be the elective affinities of\r\nthe nascent cells which in these cases differ abnormally on the two\r\nsides of the body. Almost the same principle comes into play with those\r\nanimals, for instance, certain gasteropods and Verruca amongst\r\ncirripedes, which normally have the two sides of the body constructed\r\non a very different plan; and yet a nearly equal number of individuals\r\nhave either side modified in the same remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nReversion, in the ordinary sense of the word, acts so incessantly, that\r\nit evidently forms an essential part of the general law of inheritance.\r\nIt occurs with beings, however propagated, whether by buds or seminal\r\ngeneration, and sometimes may be observed with advancing age even in\r\nthe same individual. The tendency to reversion is often induced by a\r\nchange of conditions, and in the plainest manner by crossing. Crossed\r\nforms of the first generation are generally nearly intermediate in\r\ncharacter between their two parents; but in the next generation the\r\noffspring commonly revert to one or both of their grandparents, and\r\noccasionally to more remote ancestors. How can we account for these\r\nfacts? Each unit in a hybrid must throw off, according to the doctrine\r\nof pangenesis, an abundance of hybridised gemmules, for crossed plants\r\ncan be readily and largely propagated by buds; but by the same\r\nhypothesis dormant gemmules derived from both pure parent-forms are\r\nlikewise present; and as these gemmules retain their normal condition,\r\nthey would, it is probable, be enabled to multiply largely during the\r\nlifetime of each hybrid. Consequently the sexual elements of a hybrid\r\nwill include both pure and hybridised gemmules; and when two hybrids\r\npair, the combination of pure gemmules derived from the one hybrid with\r\nthe pure gemmules of the same parts derived from the other, would\r\nnecessarily lead to complete reversion of character; and it is,\r\nperhaps, not too bold a supposition that unmodified and undeteriorated\r\ngemmules of the same nature would be especially apt to combine. Pure\r\ngemmules in combination with hybridised gemmules would lead to partial\r\nreversion. And lastly, hybridised gemmules derived from both\r\nparent-hybrids would simply reproduce the original hybrid form.[71] All\r\nthese cases and degrees of reversion incessantly occur.\r\n\r\nIt was shown in the fifteenth chapter that certain characters are\r\nantagonistic to each other or do not readily blend; hence, when two\r\nanimals with antagonistic characters are crossed, it might well happen\r\nthat a sufficiency of gemmules in the male alone for the reproduction\r\nof his peculiar characters, and in the female alone for the\r\nreproduction of her peculiar characters, would not be present; and in\r\nthis case dormant gemmules derived from the same part in some remote\r\nprogenitor might easily gain the ascendancy, and cause the reappearance\r\nof the long-lost character. For instance, when black and white pigeons,\r\nor black and white fowls, are crossed,—colours which do not readily\r\nblend,—blue plumage in the one case, evidently derived from the\r\nrock-pigeon, and red plumage in the other case, derived from the wild\r\njungle-cock, occasionally reappear. With uncrossed breeds the same\r\nresult follows, under conditions which favour the multiplication and\r\ndevelopment of certain dormant gemmules, as when animals become feral\r\nand revert to their pristine character. A certain number of gemmules\r\nbeing requisite for the development of each character, as is known to\r\nbe the case from several spermatozoa or pollen-grains being necessary\r\nfor fertilisation, and time favouring their multiplication, will\r\nperhaps account for the curious cases, insisted on by Mr. Sedgwick, of\r\ncertain diseases which regularly appear in alternate generations. This\r\nlikewise holds good, more or less strictly, with other weakly inherited\r\nmodifications. Hence, as I have heard it remarked, certain diseases\r\nappear to gain strength by the intermission of a generation. The\r\ntransmission of dormant gemmules during many successive generations is\r\nhardly in itself more improbable, as previously remarked, than the\r\nretention during many ages of rudimentary organs, or even only of a\r\ntendency to the production of a rudiment; but there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that dormant gemmules can be transmitted and propagated for\r\never. Excessively minute and numerous as they are believed to be, an\r\ninfinite number derived, during a long course of modification and\r\ndescent, from each unit of each progenitor, could not be supported or\r\nnourished by the organism. But it does not seem improbable that certain\r\ngemmules, under favourable conditions, should be retained and go on\r\nmultiplying for a much longer period than others. Finally, on the view\r\nhere given, we certainly gain some insight into the wonderful fact that\r\nthe child may depart from the type of both its parents, and resemble\r\nits grandparents, or ancestors removed by many hundreds of generations.\r\n\r\n      _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Pangenesis, as applied to the several great classes\r\nof facts just discussed, no doubt is extremely complex, but so are the\r\nfacts. The chief assumption is that all the units of the body, besides\r\nhaving the universally admitted power of growing by self-division,\r\nthrow off minute gemmules which are dispersed through the system. Nor\r\ncan this assumption be considered as too bold, for we know from the\r\ncases of graft-hybridisation that formative matter of some kind is\r\npresent in the tissues of plants, which is capable of combining with\r\nthat included in another individual, and of reproducing every unit of\r\nthe whole organism. But we have further to assume that the gemmules\r\ngrow, multiply, and aggregate themselves into buds and the sexual\r\nelements; their development depending on their union with other nascent\r\ncells or units. They are also believed to be capable of transmission in\r\na dormant state, like seeds in the ground, to successive generations.\r\n\r\nIn a highly-organised animal, the gemmules thrown off from each\r\ndifferent unit throughout the body must be inconceivably numerous and\r\nminute. Each unit of each part, as it changes during development, and\r\nwe know that some insects undergo at least twenty metamorphoses, must\r\nthrow off its gemmules. But the same cells may long continue to\r\nincrease by self-division, and even become modified by absorbing\r\npeculiar nutriment, without necessarily throwing off modified gemmules.\r\nAll organic beings, moreover, include many dormant gemmules derived\r\nfrom their grandparents and more remote progenitors, but not from all\r\ntheir progenitors. These almost infinitely numerous and minute gemmules\r\nare contained within each bud, ovule, spermatozoon, and pollen-grain.\r\nSuch an admission will be declared impossible; but number and size are\r\nonly relative difficulties. Independent organisms exist which are\r\nbarely visible under the highest powers of the microscope, and their\r\ngerms must be excessively minute. Particles of infectious matter, so\r\nsmall as to be wafted by the wind or to adhere to smooth paper, will\r\nmultiply so rapidly as to infect within a short time the whole body of\r\na large animal. We should also reflect on the admitted number and\r\nminuteness of the molecules composing a particle of ordinary matter.\r\nThe difficulty, therefore, which at first appears insurmountable, of\r\nbelieving in the existence of gemmules so numerous and small as they\r\nmust be according to our hypothesis, has no great weight.\r\n\r\nThe units of the body are generally admitted by physiologists to be\r\nautonomous. I go one step further and assume that they throw off\r\nreproductive gemmules. Thus an organism does not generate its kind as a\r\nwhole, but each separate unit generates its kind. It has often been\r\nsaid by naturalists that each cell of a plant has the potential\r\ncapacity of reproducing the whole plant; but it has this power only in\r\nvirtue of containing gemmules derived from every part. When a cell or\r\nunit is from some cause modified, the gemmules derived from it will be\r\nin like manner modified. If our hypothesis be provisionally accepted,\r\nwe must look at all the forms of asexual reproduction, whether\r\noccurring at maturity or during youth, as fundamentally the same, and\r\ndependent on the mutual aggregation and multiplication of the gemmules.\r\nThe re-growth of an amputated limb and the healing of a wound is the\r\nsame process partially carried out. Buds apparently include nascent\r\ncells, belonging to that stage of development at which the budding\r\noccurs, and these cells are ready to unite with the gemmules derived\r\nfrom the next succeeding cells. The sexual elements, on the other hand,\r\ndo not include such nascent cells; and the male and female elements\r\ntaken separately do not contain a sufficient number of gemmules for\r\nindependent development, except in the cases of parthenogenesis. The\r\ndevelopment of each being, including all the forms of metamorphosis and\r\nmetagenesis, depends on the presence of gemmules thrown off at each\r\nperiod of life, and on their development, at a corresponding period, in\r\nunion with preceding cells. Such cells may be said to be fertilised by\r\nthe gemmules which come next in due order of development. Thus the act\r\nof ordinary impregnation and the development of each part in each being\r\nare closely analogous processes. The child, strictly speaking, does not\r\ngrow into the man, but includes germs which slowly and successively\r\nbecome developed and form the man. In the child, as well as in the\r\nadult, each part generates the same part. Inheritance must be looked at\r\nas merely a form of growth, like the self-division of a lowly-organised\r\nunicellular organism. Reversion depends on the transmission from the\r\nforefather to his descendants of dormant gemmules, which occasionally\r\nbecome developed under certain known or unknown conditions. Each animal\r\nand plant may be compared with a bed of soil full of seeds, some of\r\nwhich soon germinate, some lie dormant for a period, whilst others\r\nperish. When we hear it said that a man carries in his constitution the\r\nseeds of an inherited disease, there is much truth in the expression.\r\nNo other attempt, as far as I am aware, has been made, imperfect as\r\nthis confessedly is, to connect under one point of view these several\r\ngrand classes of facts. An organic being is a microcosm—a little\r\nuniverse, formed of a host of self-propagating organisms, inconceivably\r\nminute and numerous as the stars in heaven.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] This hypothesis has been severely criticised by many writers, and\r\n it will be fair to give references to the more important articles. The\r\n best essay which I have seen is by Prof. Delpino, entitled ‘Sulla\r\n Darwiniana Teoria della Pangenesi, 1869,’ of which a translation\r\n appeared in ‘Scientific Opinion,’ Sept. 29th, 1869, and the succeeding\r\n numbers. He rejects the hypothesis, but criticises it fairly, and I\r\n have found his criticisms very useful. Mr. Mivart (‘Genesis of\r\n Species,’ 1871, chap. x.) follows Delpino, but adds no new objections\r\n of any weight. Dr. Bastian (‘The Beginnings of Life,’ 1872, vol. ii.\r\n p. 98) says that the hypothesis “looks like a relic of the old rather\r\n than a fitting appanage of the new evolution philosophy.” He shows\r\n that I ought not to have used the term “pangenesis,” as it had been\r\n previously used by Dr. Gros in another sense. Dr. Lionel Beale\r\n (‘Nature,’ May 11th, 1871, p. 26) sneers at the whole doctrine with\r\n much acerbity and some justice. Prof. Wigand (‘Schriften der Gesell.\r\n der gesammt. Naturwissen. zu Marburg,’ B. ix. 1870) considers the\r\n hypothesis as unscientific and worthless. Mr. G. H. Lewes\r\n (‘Fortnightly Review,’ Nov. 1st, 1868, p. 503) seems to consider that\r\n it may be useful: he makes many good criticisms in a perfectly fair\r\n spirit. Mr. F. Galton, after describing his valuable experiments\r\n (‘Proc. Royal Soc.,’ vol. xix. p. 393) on the intertransfusion of the\r\n blood of distinct varieties of the rabbit, concludes by saying that in\r\n his opinion the results negative beyond all doubt the doctrine of\r\n Pangenesis. He informs me that subsequently to the publication of his\r\n paper he continued his experiments on a still larger scale for two\r\n more generations, without any sign of mongrelism showing itself in the\r\n very numerous offspring. I certainly should have expected that\r\n gemmules would have been present in the blood, but this is no\r\n necessary part of the hypothesis, which manifestly applies to plants\r\n and the lowest animals. Mr. Galton, in a letter to ‘Nature’ (April\r\n 27th, 1871, p. 502), also criticises various incorrect expressions\r\n used by me. On the other hand, several writers have spoken favourably\r\n of the hypothesis, but there would be no use in giving references to\r\n their articles. I may, however, refer to Dr. Ross’ work, ‘The Graft\r\n Theory of Disease; being an application of Mr. Darwin’s hypothesis of\r\n Pangenesis,’ 1872, as he gives several original and ingenious\r\n discussions.\r\n\r\n [2] Quoted by Paget, ‘Lectures on Pathology,’ 1853, p. 159.\r\n\r\n [3] Dr. Lachmann, also, observes (‘Annals and Mag. of Nat.

More than two thousand years ago Aristotle combated a view of\r\n this kind, which, as I hear from Dr. W. Ogle, was held by Hippocrates\r\n and others. Ray, in his ‘Wisdom of God’ (2nd edit., 1692, p. 68), says\r\n that “every part of the body seems to club and contribute to the\r\n seed.” The “organic molecules” of Buffon (‘Hist. Nat. Gen.,’ edit. of\r\n 1749, tom. ii., pp. 54, 62, 329, 333, 420, 425) appear at first sight\r\n to be the same as the gemmules of my hypothesis, but they are\r\n essentially different. Bonnet (‘Œuvres d’Hist. Nat.,’ tom. v., part\r\n i., 1781, 4to edit., p. 334) speaks of the limbs having germs adapted\r\n for the reparation of all possible losses; but whether these germs are\r\n supposed to be the same with those within buds and the sexual organs\r\n is not clear. Prof. Owen says (‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii.,\r\n 1868, p. 813) that he fails to see any fundamental difference between\r\n the views which he propounded in his ‘Parthenogenesis’ (1849, pp.\r\n 5-8), and which he now considers as erroneous, and my hypothesis of\r\n pangenesis: but a reviewer (‘Journal of Anat. and Phys.,’ May 1869, p.\r\n 441) shows how different they really are. I formerly thought that the\r\n “physiological units” of Herbert Spencer (‘Principles of Biology,’\r\n vol. i., chaps. iv. and viii., 1863-64) were the same as my gemmules,\r\n but I now know that this is not the case. Lastly, it appears from a\r\n review of the present work by Prof. Mantegazza (‘Nuova Antologia,\r\n Maggio,’ 1868), that he (in his ‘Elementi di Igiene,’ Ediz. iii., p.\r\n 540) clearly foresaw the doctrine of pangenesis.\r\n\r\n [43] Mr. Lowne has observed (‘Journal of Queckett Microscopical Club,’\r\n Sept. 23rd, 1870) certain remarkable changes in the tissues of the\r\n larva of a fly, which makes him believe “it possible that organs and\r\n organisms are sometimes developed by the aggregation of excessively\r\n minute gemmules, such as those which Mr. Darwin’s hypothesis demands.”\r\n\r\n [44] ‘Annales des Sc.

Scott, of the Royal\r\n Botanic Garden of Edinburgh, calculated, in the same manner as I have\r\n done for some British Orchids (‘Fertilisation of Orchids,’ p. 344),\r\n the number of seeds in a capsule of an Acropera and found the number\r\n to be 371,250. Now this plant produces several flowers on a raceme,\r\n and many racemes during a season. In an allied genus, Gongora, Mr.\r\n Scott has seen twenty capsules produced on a single raceme; ten such\r\n racemes on the Acropera would yield above seventy-four millions of\r\n seed.\r\n\r\n [49] Paget, ‘Lectures on Pathology,’ p. 27; Virchow, ‘Cellular\r\n Pathology,’ translated by Dr. Chance, pp. 123, 126, 294.

Ernst Haeckel has recently\r\n (‘Monatsbericht Akad. Wiss. Berlin,’ Feb. 2nd, 1865) observed the\r\n surprising case of a medusa, with its reproductive organs active,\r\n which produces by budding a widely different form of medusa; and this\r\n latter also has the power of sexual reproduction.

CONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATION—NATURE AND CAUSES OF VARIABILITY—SELECTION—DIVERGENCE AND\r\nDISTINCTNESS OF CHARACTER—EXTINCTION OF RACES—CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE\r\nTO SELECTION BY MAN—ANTIQUITY OF CERTAIN RACES—THE QUESTION WHETHER\r\nEACH PARTICULAR VARIATION HAS BEEN SPECIALLY PREORDAINED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs summaries have been added to nearly all the chapters, and as, in the\r\nchapter on pangenesis, various subjects, such as the forms of\r\nreproduction, inheritance, reversion, the causes and laws of\r\nvariability, etc., have been recently discussed, I will here only make\r\na few general remarks on the more important conclusions which may be\r\ndeduced from the multifarious details given throughout this work.\r\n\r\nSavages in all parts of the world easily succeed in taming wild\r\nanimals; and those inhabiting any country or island, when first visited\r\nby man, would probably have been still more easily tamed. Complete\r\nsubjugation generally depends on an animal being social in its habits,\r\nand on receiving man as the chief of the herd or family. In order that\r\nan animal should be domesticated it must be fertile under changed\r\nconditions of life, and this is far from being always the case. An\r\nanimal would not have been worth the labour of domestication, at least\r\nduring early times, unless of service to man. From these circumstances\r\nthe number of domesticated animals has never been large. With respect\r\nto plants, I have shown in the ninth chapter how their varied uses were\r\nprobably first discovered, and the early steps in their cultivation.\r\nMan could not have known, when he first domesticated an animal or\r\nplant, whether it would flourish and multiply when transported to other\r\ncountries, therefore he could not have been thus influenced in his\r\nchoice. We see that the close adaptation of the reindeer and camel to\r\nextremely cold and hot countries has not prevented their domestication.\r\nStill less could man have foreseen whether his animals and plants would\r\nvary in succeeding generations and thus give birth to new races; and\r\nthe small capacity of variability in the goose has not prevented its\r\ndomestication from a remote epoch.\r\n\r\nWith extremely few exceptions, all animals and plants which have been\r\nlong domesticated have varied greatly. It matters not under what\r\nclimate, or for what purpose they are kept, whether as food for man or\r\nbeast, for draught or hunting, for clothing or mere pleasure,—under all\r\nthese circumstances races have been produced which differ more from one\r\nanother than do the forms which in a state of nature are ranked as\r\ndifferent species. Why certain animals and plants have varied more\r\nunder domestication than others we do not know, any more than why some\r\nare rendered more sterile than others under changed conditions of life.\r\nBut we have to judge of the amount of variation which our domestic\r\nproductions have undergone, chiefly by the number and amount of\r\ndifference between the races which have been formed, and we can often\r\nclearly see why many and distinct races have not been formed, namely,\r\nbecause slight successive variations have not been steadily\r\naccumulated; and such variations will never be accumulated if an animal\r\nor plant be not closely observed, much valued, and kept in large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuating, and, as far as we can judge, never-ending variability\r\nof our domesticated productions,—the plasticity of almost their whole\r\norganisation,--is one of the most important lessons which we learn from\r\nthe numerous details given in the earlier chapters of this work. Yet\r\ndomesticated animals and plants can hardly have been exposed to greater\r\nchanges in their conditions of life than have many natural species\r\nduring the incessant geological, geographical, and climatal changes to\r\nwhich the world has been subject; but domesticated productions will\r\noften have been exposed to more sudden changes and to less continuously\r\nuniform conditions. As man has domesticated so many animals and plants\r\nbelonging to widely different classes, and as he certainly did not\r\nchoose with prophetic instinct those species which would vary most, we\r\nmay infer that all natural species, if exposed to analogous conditions,\r\nwould, on an average, vary to the same degree. Few men at the present\r\nday will maintain that animals and plants were created with a tendency\r\nto vary, which long remained dormant, in order that fanciers in after\r\nages might rear, for instance, curious breeds of the fowl, pigeon, or\r\ncanary-bird.\r\n\r\nFrom several causes it is difficult to judge of the amount of\r\nmodification which our domestic productions have undergone. In some\r\ncases the primitive parent-stock has become extinct; or it cannot be\r\nrecognised with certainty, owing to its supposed descendants having\r\nbeen so much modified. In other cases two or more closely-allied forms,\r\nafter being domesticated, have crossed; and then it is difficult to\r\nestimate how much of the character of the present descendants ought to\r\nbe attributed to variation, and how much to the influence of the\r\nseveral parent-stocks. But the degree to which our domesticated breeds\r\nhave been modified by the crossing of distinct species has probably\r\nbeen much exaggerated by some authors. A few individuals of one form\r\nwould seldom permanently affect another form existing in greater\r\nnumbers; for, without careful selection, the stain of the foreign blood\r\nwould soon be obliterated, and during early and barbarous times, when\r\nour animals were first domesticated, such care would seldom have been\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe in the case of the dog, ox, pig, and of\r\nsome other animals, that several of our races are descended from\r\ndistinct wild prototypes; nevertheless the belief in the multiple\r\norigin of our domesticated animals has been extended by some few\r\nnaturalists and by many breeders to an unauthorised extent. Breeders\r\nrefuse to look at the whole subject under a single point of view; I\r\nhave heard it said by a man, who maintained that our fowls were\r\ndescended from at least half-a-dozen aboriginal species, that the\r\nevidence of the common origin of pigeons, ducks and rabbits, was of no\r\navail with respect to fowls. Breeders overlook the improbability of\r\nmany species having been domesticated at an early and barbarous period.\r\nThey do not consider the improbability of species having existed in a\r\nstate of nature which, if they resembled our present domestic breeds,\r\nwould have been highly abnormal in comparison with all their congeners.\r\nThey maintain that certain species, which formerly existed, have become\r\nextinct, or are now unknown, although formerly known. The assumption of\r\nso much recent extinction is no difficulty in their eyes; for they do\r\nnot judge of its probability by the facility or difficulty of the\r\nextinction of other closely-allied wild forms. Lastly, they often\r\nignore the whole subject of geographical distribution as completely as\r\nif it were the result of chance.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the reasons just assigned it is often difficult to judge\r\naccurately of the amount of change which our domesticated productions\r\nhave undergone, yet this can be ascertained in the cases in which all\r\nthe breeds are known to be descended from a single species,—as with the\r\npigeon, duck, rabbit, and almost certainly with the fowl; and by the\r\naid of analogy this can be judged of to a certain extent with\r\ndomesticated animals descended from several wild stocks. It is\r\nimpossible to read the details given in the earlier chapters and in\r\nmany published works, or to visit our various exhibitions, without\r\nbeing deeply impressed with the extreme variability of our domesticated\r\nanimals and cultivated plants. No part of the organisation escapes the\r\ntendency to vary. The variations generally affect parts of small vital\r\nor physiological importance, but so it is with the differences which\r\nexist between closely-allied species. In these unimportant characters\r\nthere is often a greater difference between the breeds of the same\r\nspecies than between the natural species of the same genus, as Isidore\r\nGeoffroy has shown to be the case with size, and as is often the case\r\nwith the colour, texture, form, etc., of the hair, feathers, horns, and\r\nother dermal appendages.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asserted that important parts never vary under\r\ndomestication, but this is a complete error. Look at the skull of the\r\npig in any one of the highly improved breeds, with the occipital\r\ncondyles and other parts greatly modified; or look at that of the niata\r\nox. Or, again, in the several breeds of the rabbit, observe the\r\nelongated skull, with the differently shaped occipital foramen, atlas,\r\nand other cervical vertebrae. The whole shape of the brain, together\r\nwith the skull, has been modified in Polish fowls; in other breeds of\r\nthe fowl the number of the vertebrae and the forms of the cervical\r\nvertebrae have been changed. In certain pigeons the shape of the lower\r\njaw, the relative length of the tongue, the size of the nostrils and\r\neyelids, the number and shape of the ribs, the form and size of the\r\noesophagus, have all varied. In certain quadrupeds the length of the\r\nintestines has been much increased or diminished. With plants we see\r\nwonderful differences in the stones of various fruits. In the\r\nCucurbitaceae several highly important characters have varied, such as\r\nthe sessile position of the stigmas on the ovarium, the position of the\r\ncarpels, and the projection of the ovarium out of the receptacle. But\r\nit would be useless to run through the many facts given in the earlier\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious how greatly the mental disposition, tastes, habits,\r\nconsensual movements, loquacity or silence, and tone of voice have\r\nvaried and been inherited in our domesticated animals. The dog offers\r\nthe most striking instance of changed mental attributes, and these\r\ndifferences cannot be accounted for by descent from distinct wild\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nNew characters may appear and old ones disappear at any stage of\r\ndevelopment, being inherited at a corresponding stage. We see this in\r\nthe difference between the eggs, the down on the chickens and the first\r\nplumage of the various breeds of the fowl; and still more plainly in\r\nthe differences between the caterpillars and cocoons of the various\r\nbreeds of the silk-moth. These facts, simple as they appear, throw\r\nlight on the differences between the larval and adult states of allied\r\nnatural species, and on the whole great subject of embryology. New\r\ncharacters first appearing late in life are apt to become attached\r\nexclusively to that sex in which they first arose, or they may be\r\ndeveloped in a much higher degree in this than in the other sex; or\r\nagain, after having become attached to one sex, they may be transferred\r\nto the opposite sex. These facts, and more especially the circumstance\r\nthat new characters seem to be particularly liable, from some unknown\r\ncause, to become attached to the male sex, have an important bearing on\r\nthe acquirement of secondary sexual characters by animals in a state of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that our domestic races do not differ in\r\nconstitutional peculiarities, but this cannot be maintained. In our\r\nimproved cattle, pigs, etc., the period of maturity, including that of\r\nthe second dentition, has been much hastened. The period of gestation\r\nvaries much, and has been modified in a fixed manner in one or two\r\ncases. In some breeds of poultry and pigeons the period at which the\r\ndown and the first plumage are acquired, differs. The number of moults\r\nthrough which the larvae of silk-moths pass, varies. The tendency to\r\nfatten, to yield much milk, to produce many young or eggs at a birth or\r\nduring life, differs in different breeds. We find different degrees of\r\nadaptation to climate, and different tendencies to certain diseases, to\r\nthe attacks of parasites, and to the action of certain vegetable\r\npoisons. With plants, adaptation to certain soils, the power of\r\nresisting frost, the period of flowering and fruiting, the duration of\r\nlife, the period of shedding the leaves or of retaining them throughout\r\nthe winter, the proportion and nature of certain chemical compounds in\r\nthe tissues or seeds, all vary.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one important constitutional difference between\r\ndomestic races and species; I refer to the sterility which almost\r\ninvariably follows, in a greater or less degree, when species are\r\ncrossed, and to the perfect fertility of the most distinct domestic\r\nraces, with the exception of a very few plants, when similarly crossed.\r\nIt is certainly a most remarkable fact that many closely-allied\r\nspecies, which in appearance differ extremely little, should yield when\r\ncrossed only a few more or less sterile offspring, or none at all;\r\nwhilst domestic races which differ conspicuously from each other are,\r\nwhen united, remarkably fertile, and yield perfectly fertile offspring.\r\nBut this fact is not in reality so inexplicable as it at first appears.\r\nIn the first place, it was clearly shown in the nineteenth chapter that\r\nthe sterility of crossed species does not depend chiefly on differences\r\nin their external structure or general constitution, but on differences\r\nin the reproductive system, analogous to those which cause the lessened\r\nfertility of the illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic\r\nplants. In the second place, the Pallasian doctrine, that species after\r\nhaving been long domesticated lose their natural tendency to sterility\r\nwhen crossed, has been shown to be highly probable or almost certain.\r\nWe cannot avoid this conclusion when we reflect on the parentage and\r\npresent fertility of the several breeds of the dog, of the Indian or\r\nhumped and European cattle, and of the two chief kinds of pigs. Hence\r\nit would be unreasonable to expect that races formed under\r\ndomestication should acquire sterility when crossed, whilst at the same\r\ntime we admit that domestication eliminates the normal sterility of\r\ncrossed species. Why with closely-allied species their reproductive\r\nsystems should almost invariably have been modified in so peculiar a\r\nmanner as to be mutually incapable of acting on each other—though in\r\nunequal degrees in the two sexes, as shown by the difference in\r\nfertility between reciprocal crosses of the same species—we do not\r\nknow, but may with much probability infer the cause to be as follows.\r\nMost natural species have been habituated to nearly uniform conditions\r\nof life for an incomparably longer time than have domestic races; and\r\nwe positively know that changed conditions exert an especial and\r\npowerful influence on the reproductive system. Hence this difference\r\nmay well account for the difference in the power of reproduction\r\nbetween domestic races when crossed and species when crossed. It is\r\nprobably in chief part owing to the same cause that domestic races can\r\nbe suddenly transported from one climate to another, or placed under\r\nwidely different conditions, and yet retain in most cases their\r\nfertility unimpaired; whilst a multitude of species subjected to lesser\r\nchanges are rendered incapable of breeding.\r\n\r\nThe offspring of crossed domestic races and of crossed species resemble\r\neach other in most respects, with the one important exception of\r\nfertility; they often partake in the same unequal degree of the\r\ncharacters of their parents, one of which is often prepotent over the\r\nother; and they are liable to reversion of the same kind. By successive\r\ncrosses one species may be made to absorb completely another, and so it\r\nnotoriously is with races. The latter resemble species in many other\r\nways. They sometimes inherit their newly-acquired characters almost or\r\neven quite as firmly as species. The conditions leading to variability\r\nand the laws governing its nature appear to be the same in both.\r\nVarieties can be classed in groups under groups, like species under\r\ngenera, and these under families and orders; and the classification may\r\nbe either artificial,—that is, founded on any arbitrary character,—or\r\nnatural. With varieties a natural classification is certainly founded,\r\nand with species is apparently founded, on community of descent,\r\ntogether with the amount of modification which the forms have\r\nundergone. The characters by which domestic varieties differ from one\r\nanother are more variable than those distinguishing species, though\r\nhardly more so than with certain polymorphic species; but this greater\r\ndegree of variability is not surprising, as varieties have generally\r\nbeen exposed within recent times to fluctuating conditions of life, and\r\nare much more liable to have been crossed; they are also in many cases\r\nstill undergoing, or have recently undergone, modification by man’s\r\nmethodical or unconscious selection.\r\n\r\nDomestic varieties as a general rule certainly differ from one another\r\nin less important parts than do species; and when important differences\r\noccur, they are seldom firmly fixed; but this fact is intelligible, if\r\nwe consider man’s method of selection. In the living animal or plant he\r\ncannot observe internal modifications in the more important organs; nor\r\ndoes he regard them as long as they are compatible with health and\r\nlife. What does the breeder care about any slight change in the molar\r\nteeth of his pigs, or for an additional molar tooth in the dog; or for\r\nany change in the intestinal canal or other internal organ? The breeder\r\ncares for the flesh of his cattle being well marbled with fat, and for\r\nan accumulation of fat within the abdomen of his sheep, and this he has\r\neffected. What would the floriculturist care for any change in the\r\nstructure of the ovarium or of the ovules? As important internal organs\r\nare certainly liable to numerous slight variations, and as these would\r\nprobably be transmitted, for many strange monstrosities are inherited,\r\nman could undoubtedly effect a certain amount of change in these\r\norgans. When he has produced any modification in an important part, he\r\nhas generally done so unintentionally, in correlation with some other\r\nconspicuous part. For instance, he has given ridges and protuberances\r\nto the skulls of fowls, by attending to the form of the comb, or to the\r\nplume of feathers on the head. By attending to the external form of the\r\npouter-pigeon, he has enormously increased the size of the oesophagus,\r\nand has added to the number of the ribs, and given them greater\r\nbreadth. With the carrier-pigeon, by increasing through steady\r\nselection the wattles on the upper mandible, he has greatly modified\r\nthe form of the lower mandible; and so in many other cases. Natural\r\nspecies, on the other hand, have been modified exclusively for their\r\nown good, to fit them for infinitely diversified conditions of life, to\r\navoid enemies of all kinds, and to struggle against a host of\r\ncompetitors. Hence, under such complex conditions, it would often\r\nhappen that modifications of the most varied kinds, in important as\r\nwell as in unimportant parts, would be advantageous or even necessary;\r\nand they would slowly but surely be acquired through the survival of\r\nthe fittest. Still more important is the fact that various indirect\r\nmodifications would likewise arise through the law of correlated\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nDomestic breeds often have an abnormal or semi-monstrous character, as\r\namongst dogs, the Italian greyhound, bulldog, Blenheim spaniel, and\r\nbloodhound,—some breeds of cattle and pigs,—several breeds of the\r\nfowl,—and the chief breeds of the pigeon. In such abnormal breeds,\r\nparts which differ but slightly or not at all in the allied natural\r\nspecies, have been greatly modified. This may be accounted for by man’s\r\noften selecting, especially at first, conspicuous and semi-monstrous\r\ndeviations of structure. We should, however, be cautious in deciding\r\nwhat deviations ought to be called monstrous: there can hardly be a\r\ndoubt that, if the brush of horse-like hair on the breast of the\r\nturkey-cock had first appeared in the domesticated bird, it would have\r\nbeen considered as a monstrosity; the great plume of feathers on the\r\nhead of the Polish cock has been thus designated, though plumes are\r\ncommon on the heads of many kinds of birds; we might call the wattle or\r\ncorrugated skin round the base of the beak of the English\r\ncarrier-pigeon a monstrosity, but we do not thus speak of the globular\r\nfleshy excrescence at the base of the beak of the _Carpophaga\r\noceanica._\r\n\r\nSome authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and\r\nnatural breeds; although in extreme cases the distinction is plain, in\r\nmany other cases it is arbitrary; the difference depending chiefly on\r\nthe kind of selection which has been applied. Artificial breeds are\r\nthose which have been intentionally improved by man; they frequently\r\nhave an unnatural appearance, and are especially liable to lose their\r\ncharacters through reversion and continued variability. The so-called\r\nnatural breeds, on the other hand, are those which are found in\r\nsemi-civilised countries, and which formerly inhabited separate\r\ndistricts in nearly all the European kingdoms. They have been rarely\r\nacted on by man’s intentional selection; more frequently by unconscious\r\nselection, and partly by natural selection, for animals kept in\r\nsemi-civilised countries have to provide largely for their own wants.\r\nSuch natural breeds will also have been directly acted on by the\r\ndifferences, though slight, in the surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is a much more important distinction between our several breeds,\r\nnamely, in some having originated from a strongly-marked or\r\nsemi-monstrous deviation of structure, which, however, may subsequently\r\nhave been augmented by selection; whilst others have been formed in so\r\nslow and insensible a manner, that if we could see their early\r\nprogenitors we should hardly be able to say when or how the breed first\r\narose. From the history of the racehorse, greyhound, gamecock, etc.,\r\nand from their general appearance, we may feel nearly confident that\r\nthey were formed by a slow process of improvement; and we know that\r\nthis has been the case with the carrier-pigeon, as well as with some\r\nother pigeons. On the other hand, it is certain that the ancon and\r\nmauchamp breeds of sheep, and almost certain that the niata cattle,\r\nturnspit, and pug-dogs, jumper and frizzled fowls, short-faced tumbler\r\npigeons, hook-billed ducks, etc., suddenly appeared in nearly the same\r\nstate as we now see them. So it has been with many cultivated plants.\r\nThe frequency of these cases is likely to lead to the false belief that\r\nnatural species have often originated in the same abrupt manner. But we\r\nhave no evidence of the appearance, or at least of the continued\r\nprocreation, under nature, of abrupt modifications of structure; and\r\nvarious general reasons could be assigned against such a belief.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have abundant evidence of the constant occurrence\r\nunder nature of slight individual differences of the most diversified\r\nkinds; and we are thus led to conclude that species have generally\r\noriginated by the natural selection of extremely slight differences.\r\nThis process may be strictly compared with the slow and gradual\r\nimprovement of the racehorse, greyhound, and gamecock. As every detail\r\nof structure in each species has to be closely adapted to its habits of\r\nlife, it will rarely happen that one part alone will be modified; but,\r\nas was formerly shown, the co-adapted modifications need not be\r\nabsolutely simultaneous. Many variations, however, are from the first\r\nconnected by the law of correlation. Hence it follows that even\r\nclosely-allied species rarely or never differ from one another by one\r\ncharacter alone; and the same remark is to a certain extent applicable\r\nto domestic races; for these, if they differ much, generally differ in\r\nmany respects.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists boldly insist[1] that species are absolutely distinct\r\nproductions, never passing by intermediate links into one another;\r\nwhilst they maintain that domestic varieties can always be connected\r\neither with one another or with their parent-forms. But if we could\r\nalways find the links between the several breeds of the dog, horse,\r\ncattle, sheep, pigs, etc., there would not have been such incessant\r\ndoubts whether they were descended from one or several species. The\r\ngreyhound genus, if such a term may be used, cannot be closely\r\nconnected with any other breed, unless, perhaps, we go back to the\r\nancient Egyptian monuments. Our English bulldog also forms a very\r\ndistinct breed. In all these cases crossed breeds must of course be\r\nexcluded, for distinct natural species can thus be likewise connected.\r\nBy what links can the Cochin fowl be closely united with others? By\r\nsearching for breeds still preserved in distant lands, and by going\r\nback to historical records, tumbler-pigeons, carriers, and barbs can be\r\nclosely connected with the parent rock-pigeon; but we cannot thus\r\nconnect the turbit or the pouter. The degree of distinctness between\r\nthe various domestic breeds depends on the amount of modification which\r\nthey have undergone, and more especially on the neglect and final\r\nextinction of intermediate and less-valued forms.\r\n\r\nIt has often been argued that no light is thrown on the changes which\r\nnatural species are believed to undergo from the admitted changes of\r\ndomestic races, as the latter are said to be mere temporary\r\nproductions, always reverting, as soon as they become feral, to their\r\npristine form. This argument has been well combated by Mr. Wallace[2]\r\nand full details were given in the thirteenth chapter, showing that the\r\ntendency to reversion in feral animals and plants has been greatly\r\nexaggerated, though no doubt it exists to a certain extent. It would be\r\nopposed to all the principles inculcated in this work, if domestic\r\nanimals, when exposed to new conditions and compelled to struggle for\r\ntheir own wants against a host of foreign competitors, were not\r\nmodified in the course of time. It should also be remembered that many\r\ncharacters lie latent in all organic beings, ready to be evolved under\r\nfitting conditions; and in breeds modified within recent times, the\r\ntendency to reversion is particularly strong. But the antiquity of some\r\nof our breeds clearly proves that they remain nearly constant as long\r\nas their conditions of life remain the same.\r\n\r\nIt has been boldly maintained by some authors that the amount of\r\nvariation to which our domestic productions are liable is strictly\r\nlimited; but this is an assertion resting on little evidence. Whether\r\nor not the amount of change in any particular direction is limited, the\r\ntendency to general variability is, as far as we can judge, unlimited.\r\nCattle, sheep, and pigs have varied under domestication from the\r\nremotest period, as shown by the researches of Rutimeyer and others;\r\nyet these animals have been improved to an unparalleled degree, within\r\nquite recent times, and this implies continued variability of\r\nstructure. Wheat, as we know from the remains found in the Swiss\r\nlake-dwellings, is one of the most anciently cultivated plants, yet at\r\nthe present day new and better varieties frequently arise. It may be\r\nthat an ox will never be produced of larger size and finer proportions,\r\nor a racehorse fleeter, than our present animals, or a gooseberry\r\nlarger than the London variety; but he would be a bold man who would\r\nassert that the extreme limit in these respects has been finally\r\nattained. With flowers and fruit it has repeatedly been asserted that\r\nperfection has been reached, but the standard has soon been excelled. A\r\nbreed of pigeons may never be produced with a beak shorter than that of\r\nthe present short-faced tumbler, or with one longer than that of the\r\nEnglish carrier, for these birds have weak constitutions and are bad\r\nbreeders; but shortness and length of beak are the points which have\r\nbeen steadily improved during the last 150 years, and some of the best\r\njudges deny that the goal has yet been reached. From reasons which\r\ncould be assigned, it is probable that parts which have now reached\r\ntheir maximum development, might, after remaining constant during a\r\nlong period, vary again in the direction of increase under new\r\nconditions of life. But there must be, as Mr. Wallace has remarked with\r\nmuch truth,[3] a limit to change in certain directions both with\r\nnatural and domestic productions; for instance, there must be a limit\r\nto the fleetness of any terrestrial animal, as this will be determined\r\nby the friction to be overcome, the weight to be carried, and the power\r\nof contraction in the muscular fibres. The English racehorse may have\r\nreached this limit; but it already surpasses in fleetness its own wild\r\nprogenitor and all other equine species. The short-faced tumbler-pigeon\r\nhas a beak shorter, and the carrier a beak longer, relatively to the\r\nsize of their bodies, than that of any natural species of the family.\r\nOur apples, pears and gooseberries bear larger fruit than those of any\r\nnatural species of the same genera; and so in many other cases.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, seeing the great difference between many domestic\r\nbreeds, that some few naturalists have concluded that each is descended\r\nfrom a distinct aboriginal stock, more especially as the principle of\r\nselection has been ignored, and the high antiquity of man, as a breeder\r\nof animals, has only recently become known. Most naturalists, however,\r\nfreely admit that our various breeds, however dissimilar, are descended\r\nfrom a single stock, although they do not know much about the art of\r\nbreeding, cannot show the connecting links, nor say where and when the\r\nbreeds arose. Yet these same naturalists declare, with an air of\r\nphilosophical caution, that they will never admit that one natural\r\nspecies has given birth to another until they behold all the\r\ntransitional steps. Fanciers use exactly the same language with respect\r\nto domestic breeds; thus, an author of an excellent treatise on pigeons\r\nsays he will never allow that the carrier and fantail are the\r\ndescendants of the wild rock-pigeon, until the transitions have\r\n“actually been observed, and can be repeated whenever man chooses to\r\nset about the task.” No doubt it is difficult to realise that slight\r\nchanges added up during long centuries can produce such great results;\r\nbut he who wishes to understand the origin of domestic breeds or of\r\nnatural species must overcome this difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe causes which excite and the laws which govern variability have been\r\ndiscussed so lately, that I need here only enumerate the leading\r\npoints. As domesticated organisms are much more liable to slight\r\ndeviations of structure and to monstrosities than species living under\r\ntheir natural conditions, and as widely-ranging species generally vary\r\nmore than those which inhabit restricted areas, we may infer that\r\nvariability mainly depends on changed conditions of life. We must not\r\noverlook the effects of the unequal combination of the characters\r\nderived from both parents, or reversion to former progenitors. Changed\r\nconditions have an especial tendency to render the reproductive organs\r\nmore or less impotent, as shown in the chapter devoted to this subject;\r\nand these organs consequently often fail to transmit faithfully the\r\nparental characters. Changed conditions also act directly and\r\ndefinitely on the organisation, so that all or nearly all the\r\nindividuals of the same species thus exposed become modified in the\r\nsame manner; but why this or that part is especially affected we can\r\nseldom or ever say. In most cases, however, a change in the conditions\r\nseems to act indefinitely, causing diversified variations in nearly the\r\nsame manner as exposure to cold or the absorption of the same poison\r\naffects different individuals in different ways. We have reason to\r\nsuspect that an habitual excess of highly-nutritious food, or an excess\r\nrelatively to the wear and tear of the organisation from exercise, is a\r\npowerful exciting cause of variability. When we see the symmetrical and\r\ncomplex outgrowths, caused by a minute drop of the poison of a\r\ngall-insect, we may believe that slight changes in the chemical nature\r\nof the sap or blood would lead to extraordinary modifications of\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe increased use of a muscle with its various attached parts, and the\r\nincreased activity of a gland or other organ, lead to their increased\r\ndevelopment. Disuse has a contrary effect. With domesticated\r\nproductions, although their organs sometimes become rudimentary through\r\nabortion, we have no reason to suppose that this has ever followed\r\nsolely from disuse. With natural species, on the contrary, many organs\r\nappear to have been rendered rudimentary through disuse, aided by the\r\nprinciple of the economy of growth together with intercrossing.\r\nComplete abortion can be accounted for only by the hypothesis given in\r\nthe last chapter, namely, the final destruction of the germs or\r\ngemmules of useless parts. This difference between species and domestic\r\nvarieties may be partly accounted for by disuse having acted on the\r\nlatter for an insufficient length of time, and partly from their\r\nexemption from any severe struggle for existence entailing rigid\r\neconomy in the development of each part, to which all species under\r\nnature are subjected. Nevertheless the law of compensation or\r\nbalancement, which likewise depends on the economy of growth,\r\napparently has affected to a certain extent our domesticated\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nAs almost every part of the organisation becomes highly variable under\r\ndomestication, and as variations are easily selected both consciously\r\nand unconsciously, it is very difficult to distinguish between the\r\neffects of the selection of indefinite variations and the direct action\r\nof the conditions of life. For instance, it is possible that the feet\r\nof our water-dogs and of the American dogs which have to travel much\r\nover the snow, may have become partially webbed from the stimulus of\r\nwidely extending their toes; but it is more probable that the webbing,\r\nlike the membrane between the toes of certain pigeons, spontaneously\r\nappeared and was afterwards increased by the best swimmers and the best\r\nsnow-travellers being preserved during many generations. A fancier who\r\nwished to decrease the size of his bantams or tumbler-pigeons would\r\nnever think of starving them, but would select the smallest individuals\r\nwhich spontaneously appeared. Quadrupeds are sometimes born destitute\r\nof hair and hairless breeds have been formed, but there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that this is caused by a hot climate. Within the tropics heat\r\noften causes sheep to lose their fleeces; on the other hand, wet and\r\ncold act as a direct stimulus to the growth of hair; but who will\r\npretend to decide how far the thick fur of arctic animals, or their\r\nwhite colour, is due to the direct action of a severe climate, and how\r\nfar to the preservation of the best-protected individuals during a long\r\nsuccession of generations?\r\n\r\nOf all the laws governing variability, that of correlation is one of\r\nthe most important. In many cases of slight deviations of structure as\r\nwell as of grave monstrosities, we cannot even conjecture what is the\r\nnature of the bond of connexion. But between homologous parts—between\r\nthe fore and hind limbs—between the hair, hoofs, horns, and teeth—which\r\nare closely similar during their early development and which are\r\nexposed to similar conditions, we can see that they would be eminently\r\nliable to be modified in the same manner. Homologous parts, from having\r\nthe same nature, are apt to blend together, and, when many exist, to\r\nvary in number.\r\n\r\nAlthough every variation is either directly or indirectly caused by\r\nsome change in the surrounding conditions, we must never forget that\r\nthe nature of the organisation which is acted on, is by far the more\r\nimportant factor in the result. We see this in different organisms,\r\nwhich when placed under similar conditions vary in a different manner,\r\nwhilst closely-allied organisms under dissimilar conditions often vary\r\nin nearly the same manner. We see this, in the same modification\r\nfrequently reappearing in the same variety at long intervals of time,\r\nand likewise in the several striking cases given of analogous or\r\nparallel variations. Although some of these latter cases are due to\r\nreversion, others cannot thus be accounted for.\r\n\r\nFrom the indirect action of changed conditions on the organisation,\r\nowing to the reproductive organs being thus affected—from the direct\r\naction of such conditions, and these will cause the individuals of the\r\nsame species either to vary in the same manner, or differently in\r\naccordance with slight differences in their constitution—from the\r\neffects of the increased or decreased use of parts—and from\r\ncorrelation,—the variability of our domesticated productions is\r\ncomplicated to an extreme degree. The whole organisation becomes\r\nslightly plastic. Although each modification must have its own exciting\r\ncause, and though each is subjected to law, yet we can so rarely trace\r\nthe precise relation between cause and effect, that we are tempted to\r\nspeak of variations as if they arose spontaneously. We may even call\r\nthem accidental, but this must be only in the sense in which we say\r\nthat a fragment of rock dropped from a height owes its shape to\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while briefly to consider the result of the exposure to\r\nunnatural conditions of a large number of animals of the same species\r\nand allowed to cross freely with no selection of any kind, and\r\nafterwards to consider the result when selection is brought into play.\r\nLet us suppose that 500 wild rock-pigeons were confined in their native\r\nland in an aviary and fed in the same manner as pigeons usually are;\r\nand that they were not allowed to increase in number. As pigeons\r\npropagate so rapidly, I suppose that a thousand or fifteen hundred\r\nbirds would have to be annually killed. After several generations had\r\nbeen thus reared, we may feel sure that some of the young birds would\r\nvary, and the variations would tend to be inherited; for at the present\r\nday slight deviations of structure often occur and are inherited. It\r\nwould be tedious even to enumerate the multitude of points which still\r\ngo on varying or have recently varied. Many variations would occur in\r\ncorrelation with one another, as the length of the wing and tail\r\nfeathers—the number of the primary wing-feathers, as well as the number\r\nand breadth of the ribs, in correlation with the size and form of the\r\nbody—the number of the scutellae with the size of the feet—the length\r\nof the tongue with the length of the beak—the size of the nostrils and\r\neyelids and the form of lower jaw in correlation with the development\r\nof wattle—the nakedness of the young with the future colour of the\r\nplumage—the size of the feet with that of the beak, and other such\r\npoints. Lastly, as our birds are supposed to be confined in an aviary,\r\nthey would use their wings and legs but little, and certain parts of\r\nthe skeleton, such as the sternum, scapulae and feet, would in\r\nconsequence become slightly reduced in size.\r\n\r\nAs in our assumed case many birds have to be indiscriminately killed\r\nevery year, the chances are against any new variety surviving long\r\nenough to breed. And as the variations which arise are of an extremely\r\ndiversified nature, the chances are very great against two birds\r\npairing which have varied in the same manner; nevertheless, a varying\r\nbird even when not thus paired would occasionally transmit its\r\ncharacter to its young; and these would not only be exposed to the same\r\nconditions which first caused the variation in question to appear, but\r\nwould in addition inherit from their modified parent a tendency again\r\nto vary in the same manner. So that, if the conditions decidedly tended\r\nto induce some particular variation, all the birds might in the course\r\nof time become similarly modified. But a far commoner result would be,\r\nthat one bird would vary in one way and another bird in another way;\r\none would be born with a beak a little longer, and another with a\r\nshorter beak; one would gain some black feathers, another some white or\r\nred feathers. And as these birds would be continually intercrossing,\r\nthe final result would be a body of individuals differing from each\r\nother in many ways, but only slightly; yet more than did the original\r\nrock-pigeons. But there would not be the least tendency towards the\r\nformation of several distinct breeds.\r\n\r\nIf two separate lots of pigeons were treated in the manner just\r\ndescribed, one in England and the other in a tropical country, the two\r\nlots being supplied with different kinds of food, would they after many\r\ngenerations differ? When we reflect on the cases given in the\r\ntwenty-third chapter, and on such facts as the difference in former\r\ntimes between the breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., in almost every\r\ndistrict of Europe, we are strongly inclined to admit that the two lots\r\nwould be differently modified through the influence of climate and\r\nfood. But the evidence on the definite action of changed conditions is\r\nin most cases insufficient; and, with respect to pigeons, I have had\r\nthe opportunity of examining a large collection of domesticated kinds,\r\nsent to me by Sir W. Elliot from India, and they varied in a remarkably\r\nsimilar manner with our European birds.\r\n\r\nIf two distinct breeds were mingled together in equal numbers, there is\r\nreason to suspect that they would to a certain extent prefer pairing\r\nwith their own kind; but they would often intercross. From the greater\r\nvigour and fertility of the crossed offspring, the whole body would by\r\nthis means become interblended sooner than would otherwise have\r\noccurred. From certain breeds being prepotent over others, it does not\r\nfollow that the interblended progeny would be strictly intermediate in\r\ncharacter. I have, also, proved that the act of crossing in itself\r\ngives a strong tendency to reversion, so that the crossed offspring\r\nwould tend to revert to the state of the aboriginal rock-pigeon; and in\r\nthe course of time they would probably be not much more heterogeneous\r\nin character than in our first case, when birds of the same breed were\r\nconfined together.\r\n\r\nI have just said that the crossed offspring would gain in vigour and\r\nfertility. From the facts given in the seventeenth chapter there can be\r\nno doubt of this fact; and there can be little doubt, though the\r\nevidence on this head is not so easily acquired, that long-continued\r\nclose interbreeding leads to evil results. With hermaphrodites of all\r\nkinds, if the sexual elements of the same individual habitually acted\r\non each other, the closest possible interbreeding would be perpetual.\r\nBut we should bear in mind that the structure of all hermaphrodite\r\nanimals, as far as I can learn, permits and frequently necessitates a\r\ncross with a distinct individual. With hermaphrodite plants we\r\nincessantly meet with elaborate and perfect contrivances for this same\r\nend. It is no exaggeration to assert that, if the use of the talons and\r\ntusks of a carnivorous animal, or of the plumes and hooks on a seed,\r\nmay be safely inferred from their structure, we may with equal safety\r\ninfer that many flowers are constructed for the express purpose of\r\nensuring a cross with a distinct plant. From these various\r\nconsiderations, not to mention the result of a long series of\r\nexperiments which I have tried, the conclusion arrived at in the\r\nchapter just referred to—namely, that great good of some kind is\r\nderived from the sexual concourse of distinct individuals—must be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nTo return to our illustration: we have hitherto assumed that the birds\r\nwere kept down to the same number by indiscriminate slaughter; but if\r\nthe least choice be permitted in their preservation, the whole result\r\nwill be changed. Should the owner observe any slight variation in one\r\nof his birds, and wish to obtain a breed thus characterised, he would\r\nsucceed in a surprisingly short time by careful selection. As any part\r\nwhich has once varied generally goes on varying in the same direction,\r\nit is easy, by continually preserving the most strongly marked\r\nindividuals, to increase the amount of difference up to a high,\r\npredetermined standard of excellence. This is methodical selection.\r\n\r\nIf the owner of the aviary, without any thought of making a new breed,\r\nsimply admired, for instance, short-beaked more than long-beaked birds,\r\nhe would, when he had to reduce the number, generally kill the latter;\r\nand there can be no doubt that he would thus in the course of time\r\nsensibly modify his stock. It is improbable, if two men were to keep\r\npigeons and act in this manner, that they would prefer exactly the same\r\ncharacters; they would, as we know, often prefer directly opposite\r\ncharacters, and the two lots would ultimately come to differ. This has\r\nactually occurred with strains or families of cattle, sheep, and\r\npigeons, which have been long kept and carefully attended to by\r\ndifferent breeders, without any wish on their part to form new and\r\ndistinct sub-breeds. This unconscious kind of selection will more\r\nespecially come into action with animals which are highly serviceable\r\nto man; for every one tries to get the best dogs, horses, cows, or\r\nsheep, without thinking about their future progeny, yet these animals\r\nwould transmit more or less surely their good qualities to their\r\noffspring. Nor is any one so careless as to breed from his worst\r\nanimals. Even savages, when compelled from extreme want to kill some of\r\ntheir animals, would destroy the worst and preserve the best. With\r\nanimals kept for use and not for mere amusement, different fashions\r\nprevail in different districts, leading to the preservation, and\r\nconsequently to the transmission, of all sorts of trifling\r\npeculiarities of character. The same process will have been pursued\r\nwith our fruit-trees and vegetables, for the best will always have been\r\nthe most largely cultivated, and will occasionally have yielded\r\nseedlings better than their parents.\r\n\r\nThe different strains, just alluded to, which have been actually\r\nproduced by breeders without any wish on their part to obtain such a\r\nresult, afford excellent evidence of the power of unconscious\r\nselection. This form of selection has probably led to far more\r\nimportant results than methodical selection, and is likewise more\r\nimportant under a theoretical point of view from closely resembling\r\nnatural selection. For during this process the best or most valued\r\nindividuals are not separated and prevented from crossing with others\r\nof the same breed, but are simply preferred and preserved; yet this\r\ninevitably leads to their gradual modification and improvement; so that\r\nfinally they prevail, to the exclusion of the old parent-form.\r\n\r\nWith our domesticated animals natural selection checks the production\r\nof races with any injurious deviation of structure. In the case of\r\nanimals which, from being kept by savages or semi-civilised people,\r\nhave to provide largely for their own wants under different\r\ncircumstances, natural selection will have played a more important\r\npart. Hence it probably is that they often closely resemble natural\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAs there is no limit to man’s desire to possess animals and plants more\r\nand more useful in any respect, and as the fancier always wishes, owing\r\nto fashions running into extremes, to produce each character more and\r\nmore strongly pronounced, there is, through the prolonged action of\r\nmethodical and unconscious selection, a constant tendency in every\r\nbreed to become more and more different from its parent-stock; and when\r\nseveral breeds have been produced and are valued for different\r\nqualities, to differ more and more from each other. This leads to\r\nDivergence of Character. As improved sub-varieties and races are slowly\r\nformed, the older and less improved breeds are neglected and decrease\r\nin number. When few individuals of any breed exist within the same\r\nlocality, close interbreeding, by lessening their vigour and fertility,\r\naids in their final extinction. Thus the intermediate links are lost,\r\nand the remaining breeds gain in Distinctness of Character.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters on the Pigeon, it was proved by historical evidence and\r\nby the existence of connecting sub-varieties in distant lands that\r\nseveral breeds have steadily diverged in character, and that many old\r\nand intermediate sub-breeds have been lost. Other cases could be\r\nadduced of the extinction of domestic breeds, as of the Irish wolf-dog,\r\nthe old English hound, and of two breeds in France, one of which was\r\nformerly highly valued.[4] Mr. Pickering remarks[5] that “the sheep\r\nfigured on the most ancient Egyptian monuments is unknown at the\r\npresent day; and at least one variety of the bullock, formerly known in\r\nEgypt, has in like manner become extinct.” So it has been with some\r\nanimals and with several plants cultivated by the ancient inhabitants\r\nof Europe during the neolithic period. In Peru, Von Tschudi[6] found in\r\ncertain tombs, apparently prior to the dynasty of the Incas, two kinds\r\nof maize not now known in the country. With our flowers and culinary\r\nvegetables, the production of new varieties and their extinction has\r\nincessantly recurred. At the present time improved breeds sometimes\r\ndisplace older breeds at an extraordinarily rapid rate; as has recently\r\noccurred throughout England with pigs. The Longhorn cattle in their\r\nnative home were “suddenly swept away as if by some murderous\r\npestilence,” by the introduction of Shorthorns.[7]\r\n\r\nWhat grand results have followed from the long-continued action of\r\nmethodical and unconscious selection, regulated to a certain extent by\r\nnatural selection, we see on every side of us. Compare the many animals\r\nand plants which are displayed at our exhibitions with their\r\nparent-forms when these are known, or consult old historical records\r\nwith respect to their former state. Most of our domesticated animals\r\nhave given rise to numerous and distinct races, but those which cannot\r\nbe easily subjected to selection must be excepted—such as cats, the\r\ncochineal insect, and the hive-bee. In accordance with what we know of\r\nthe process of selection, the formation of our many races has been slow\r\nand gradual. The man who first observed and preserved a pigeon with its\r\noesophagus a little enlarged, its beak a little longer, or its tail a\r\nlittle more expanded than usual, never dreamed that he had made the\r\nfirst step in the creation of a pouter, carrier, and fantail-pigeon.\r\nMan can create not only anomalous breeds, but others having their whole\r\nstructure admirably co-ordinated for certain purposes, such as the\r\nracehorse and dray-horse, or the greyhound and bulldog. It is by no\r\nmeans necessary that each small change of structure throughout the\r\nbody, leading towards excellence, should simultaneously arise and be\r\nselected. Although man seldom attends to differences in organs which\r\nare important under a physiological point of view, yet he has so\r\nprofoundly modified some breeds, that assuredly, if found wild, they\r\nwould be ranked as distinct genera.\r\n\r\nThe best proof of what selection has effected is perhaps afforded by\r\nthe fact that whatever part or quality in any animal, and more\r\nespecially in any plant, is most valued by man, that part or quality\r\ndiffers most in the several races. This result is well seen by\r\ncomparing the amount of difference between the fruits produced by the\r\nseveral varieties of fruit-trees, between the flowers of our\r\nflower-garden plants, between the seeds, roots, or leaves of our\r\nculinary and agricultural plants, in comparison with the other and not\r\nvalued parts of the same varieties. Striking evidence of a different\r\nkind is afforded by the fact ascertained by Oswald Heer[8] namely, that\r\nthe seeds of a large number of plants,—wheat, barley, oats, peas,\r\nbeans, lentils, poppies,—cultivated for their seed by the ancient\r\nLake-inhabitants of Switzerland, were all smaller than the seeds of our\r\nexisting varieties. Rütimeyer has shown that the sheep and cattle which\r\nwere kept by the earlier Lake-inhabitants were likewise smaller than\r\nour present breeds. In the middens of Denmark, the earliest dog of\r\nwhich the remains have been found was the weakest; this was succeeded\r\nduring the Bronze age by a stronger kind, and this again during the\r\nIron age by one still stronger. The sheep of Denmark during the Bronze\r\nperiod had extraordinarily slender limbs, and the horse was smaller\r\nthan our present animal.[9] No doubt in most of these cases the new and\r\nlarger breeds were introduced from foreign lands by the immigration of\r\nnew hordes of men. But it is not probable that each larger breed, which\r\nin the course of time has supplanted a previous and smaller breed, was\r\nthe descendant of a distinct and larger species; it is far more\r\nprobable that the domestic races of our various animals were gradually\r\nimproved in different parts of the great Europaeo-Asiatic continent,\r\nand thence spread to other countries. This fact of the gradual increase\r\nin size of our domestic animals is all the more striking as certain\r\nwild or half-wild animals, such as red-deer, aurochs, park-cattle, and\r\nboars[10] have within nearly the same period decreased in size.\r\n\r\nThe conditions favourable to selection by man are,—the closest\r\nattention to every character,—long-continued perseverance,—facility in\r\nmatching or separating animals,—and especially a large number being\r\nkept, so that the inferior individuals may be freely rejected or\r\ndestroyed, and the better ones preserved. When many are kept there will\r\nalso be a greater chance of the occurrence of well-marked deviations of\r\nstructure. Length of time is all-important; for as each character, in\r\norder to become strongly pronounced, has to be augmented by the\r\nselection of successive variations of the same kind, this can be\r\neffected only during a long series of generations. Length of time will,\r\nalso, allow any new feature to become fixed by the continued rejection\r\nof those individuals which revert or vary, and by the preservation of\r\nthose which still inherit the new character. Hence, although some few\r\nanimals have varied rapidly in certain respects under new conditions of\r\nlife, as dogs in India and sheep in the West Indies, yet all the\r\nanimals and plants which have produced strongly marked races were\r\ndomesticated at an extremely remote epoch, often before the dawn of\r\nhistory. As a consequence of this, no record has been preserved of the\r\norigin of our chief domestic breeds. Even at the present day new\r\nstrains or sub-breeds are formed so slowly that their first appearance\r\npasses unnoticed. A man attends to some particular character, or merely\r\nmatches his animals with unusual care, and after a time a slight\r\ndifference is perceived by his neighbours;—the difference goes on being\r\naugmented by unconscious and methodical selection, until at last a new\r\nsub-breed is formed, receives a local name, and spreads; but by this\r\ntime its history is almost forgotten. When the new breed has spread\r\nwidely, it gives rise to new strains and sub-breeds, and the best of\r\nthese succeed and spread, supplanting other and older breeds; and so\r\nalways onwards in the march of improvement.\r\n\r\nWhen a well-marked breed has once been established, if not supplanted\r\nby still further improved sub-breeds, and if not exposed to greatly\r\nchanged conditions of life inducing further variability or reversion to\r\nlong-lost characters, it may apparently last for an enormous period. We\r\nmay infer that this is the case from the high antiquity of certain\r\nraces; but some caution is necessary on this head, for the same\r\nvariation may appear independently after long intervals of time, or in\r\ndistant places. We may safely assume that this has occurred with the\r\nturnspit-dog, of which one is figured on the ancient Egyptian\r\nmonuments—with the solid-hoofed swine[11] mentioned by Aristotle—with\r\nfive-toed fowls described by Columella—and certainly with the\r\nnectarine. The dogs represented on the Egyptian monuments, about 2000\r\nB.C., show us that some of the chief breeds then existed, but it is\r\nextremely doubtful whether any are identically the same with our\r\npresent breeds. A great mastiff sculptured on an Assyrian tomb, 640\r\nB.C., is said to be the same with the dog still imported from Thibet\r\ninto the same region. The true greyhound existed during the Roman\r\nclassical period. Coming down to a later period, we have seen that,\r\nthough most of the chief breeds of the pigeon existed between two and\r\nthree centuries ago, they have not all retained exactly the same\r\ncharacter to the present day; but this has occurred in certain cases in\r\nwhich no improvement was desired, for instance, in the case of the Spot\r\nand Indian ground-tumbler.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle[12] has fully discussed the antiquity of various races of\r\nplants; he states that the black seeded poppy was known in the time of\r\nHomer, the white-seeded sesamum by the ancient Egyptians, and almonds\r\nwith sweet and bitter kernels by the Hebrews; but it does not seem\r\nimprobable that some of these varieties may have been lost and\r\nreappeared. One variety of barley and apparently one of wheat, both of\r\nwhich were cultivated at an immensely remote period by the\r\nLake-inhabitants of Switzerland, still exist. It is said[13] that\r\n“specimens of a small variety of gourd which is still common in the\r\nmarket of Lima were exhumed from an ancient cemetery in Peru.” De\r\nCandolle remarks that, in the books and drawings of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the principal races of the cabbage, turnip, and gourd can be\r\nrecognised: this might have been expected at so late a period, but\r\nwhether any of these plants are absolutely identical with our present\r\nsub-varieties is not certain. It is, however, said that the Brussels\r\nsprout, a variety which in some places is liable to degeneration, has\r\nremained genuine for more than four centuries in the district where it\r\nis believed to have originated.[14]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the views maintained by me in this work and\r\nelsewhere, not only the various domestic races, but the most distinct\r\ngenera and orders within the same great class—for instance, mammals,\r\nbirds, reptiles, and fishes—are all the descendants of one common\r\nprogenitor, and we must admit that the whole vast amount of difference\r\nbetween these forms has primarily arisen from simple variability. To\r\nconsider the subject under this point of view is enough to strike one\r\ndumb with amazement. But our amazement ought to be lessened when we\r\nreflect that beings almost infinite in number, during an almost\r\ninfinite lapse of time, have often had their whole organisation\r\nrendered in some degree plastic, and that each slight modification of\r\nstructure which was in any way beneficial under excessively complex\r\nconditions of life has been preserved, whilst each which was in any way\r\ninjurious has been rigorously destroyed. And the long-continued\r\naccumulation of beneficial variations will infallibly have led to\r\nstructures as diversified, as beautifully adapted for various purposes\r\nand as excellently co-ordinated, as we see in the animals and plants\r\naround us. Hence I have spoken of selection as the paramount power,\r\nwhether applied by man to the formation of domestic breeds, or by\r\nnature to the production of species. I may recur to the metaphor given\r\nin a former chapter: if an architect were to rear a noble and\r\ncommodious edifice, without the use of cut stone, by selecting from the\r\nfragments at the base of a precipice wedge-formed stones for his\r\narches, elongated stones for his lintels, and flat stones for his roof,\r\nwe should admire his skill and regard him as the paramount power. Now,\r\nthe fragments of stone, though indispensable to the architect, bear to\r\nthe edifice built by him the same relation which the fluctuating\r\nvariations of organic beings bear to the varied and admirable\r\nstructures ultimately acquired by their modified descendants.\r\n\r\nSome authors have declared that natural selection explains nothing,\r\nunless the precise cause of each slight individual difference be made\r\nclear. If it were explained to a savage utterly ignorant of the art of\r\nbuilding, how the edifice had been raised stone upon stone, and why\r\nwedge-formed fragments were used for the arches, flat stones for the\r\nroof, etc.; and if the use of each part and of the whole building were\r\npointed out, it would be unreasonable if he declared that nothing had\r\nbeen made clear to him, because the precise cause of the shape of each\r\nfragment could not be told. But this is a nearly parallel case with the\r\nobjection that selection explains nothing, because we know not the\r\ncause of each individual difference in the structure of each being.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the fragments of stone at the base of our precipice may be\r\ncalled accidental, but this is not strictly correct; for the shape of\r\neach depends on a long sequence of events, all obeying natural laws; on\r\nthe nature of the rock, on the lines of deposition or cleavage, on the\r\nform of the mountain, which depends on its upheaval and subsequent\r\ndenudation, and lastly on the storm or earthquake which throws down the\r\nfragments. But in regard to the use to which the fragments may be put,\r\ntheir shape may be strictly said to be accidental. And here we are led\r\nto face a great difficulty, in alluding to which I am aware that I am\r\ntravelling beyond my proper province. An omniscient Creator must have\r\nforeseen every consequence which results from the laws imposed by Him.\r\nBut can it be reasonably maintained that the Creator intentionally\r\nordered, if we use the words in any ordinary sense, that certain\r\nfragments of rock should assume certain shapes so that the builder\r\nmight erect his edifice? If the various laws which have determined the\r\nshape of each fragment were not predetermined for the builder’s sake,\r\ncan it be maintained with any greater probability that He specially\r\nordained for the sake of the breeder each of the innumerable variations\r\nin our domestic animals and plants;—many of these variations being of\r\nno service to man, and not beneficial, far more often injurious, to the\r\ncreatures themselves? Did He ordain that the crop and tail-feathers of\r\nthe pigeon should vary in order that the fancier might make his\r\ngrotesque pouter and fantail breeds? Did He cause the frame and mental\r\nqualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be formed of\r\nindomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down the bull for man’s\r\nbrutal sport? But if we give up the principle in one case,—if we do not\r\nadmit that the variations of the primeval dog were intentionally guided\r\nin order that the greyhound, for instance, that perfect image of\r\nsymmetry and vigour, might be formed,—no shadow of reason can be\r\nassigned for the belief that variations, alike in nature and the result\r\nof the same general laws, which have been the groundwork through\r\nnatural selection of the formation of the most perfectly adapted\r\nanimals in the world, man included, were intentionally and specially\r\nguided. However much we may wish it, we can hardly follow Professor Asa\r\nGray in his belief “that variation has been led along certain\r\nbeneficial lines,” like a stream “along definite and useful lines of\r\nirrigation.” If we assume that each particular variation was from the\r\nbeginning of all time preordained, then that plasticity of\r\norganisation, which leads to many injurious deviations of structure, as\r\nwell as the redundant power of reproduction which inevitably leads to a\r\nstruggle for existence, and, as a consequence, to the natural selection\r\nor survival of the fittest, must appear to us superfluous laws of\r\nnature. On the other hand, an omnipotent and omniscient Creator ordains\r\neverything and foresees everything. Thus we are brought face to face\r\nwith a difficulty as insoluble as is that of free will and\r\npredestination.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n [1] Godron, ‘De l’Espèce,’ 1859, tom. ii. p. 44, etc.\r\n\r\n [2] ‘Journal Proc.
