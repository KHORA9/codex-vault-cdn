None can\r\ndoubt that by making special experiments and collecting manifest and\r\nundeniable facts, arranging them in logical order, and observing\r\nwhat is naturally and fairly deducible, the result will be far more\r\nconsistent and satisfactory than by framing a theory or system and\r\nassuming the existence of causes for which there is no direct evidence,\r\nand which can only be admitted “for the sake of argument.” All theories\r\nare of this character--“supposing instead of inquiring, imagining\r\nsystems instead of learning from observation and experience the true\r\nconstitution of things. Speculative men, by the force of genius may\r\ninvent systems that will perhaps be greatly admired for a time; these,\r\nhowever, are phantoms which the force of truth will sooner or later\r\ndispel; and while we are pleased with the deceit, true philosophy, with\r\nall the arts and improvements that depend upon it, suffers. The real\r\nstate of things escapes our observation; or, if it presents itself\r\nto us, we are apt either to reject it wholly as fiction, or, by new\r\nefforts of a vain ingenuity to interweave it with our own conceits,\r\nand labour to make it tally with our favourite schemes. Thus, by\r\nblending together parts so ill-suited, the whole comes forth an absurd\r\ncomposition of truth and error. * * These have not done near so much\r\nharm as that pride and ambition which has led philosophers to think it\r\nbeneath them to offer anything less to the world than a complete and\r\nfinished system of nature; and, in order to obtain this at once, to\r\ntake the liberty of inventing certain principles and hypotheses, from\r\nwhich they pretend to explain all her mysteries.”[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] “An Account of Sir Isaac Newton’s Discoveries.” By Professor\r\n  Maclaurin, M.A., F.R.S., of the Chair of Mathematics in the\r\n  University of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nCopernicus admitted, “It is not necessary that hypotheses should be\r\ntrue, or even probable; it is sufficient that they lead to results\r\nof calculation which agree with calculations. * * Neither let any\r\none, so far as hypotheses are concerned, expect anything _certain_\r\nfrom astronomy; since that science can afford nothing of the kind;\r\nlest, in case he should adopt for truth things feigned for another\r\npurpose, he should leave this study more foolish than he came. * * The\r\nhypothesis of the terrestrial motion was _nothing but an hypothesis_,\r\nvaluable only so far as it explained phenomena, and not considered\r\nwith reference to absolute truth or falsehood.” The Newtonian and all\r\nother “systems of nature” are little better than the “hypothesis of\r\nthe terrestrial motion” of Copernicus. The foundations or premises are\r\nalways unproved; no proof is ever attempted; the necessity for it is\r\ndenied; it is considered sufficient that the assumptions shall _seem_\r\nto explain the phenomena selected. In this way it is that one theory\r\nsupplants another; that system gives way to system as one failure after\r\nanother compels opinions to change. This will ever be so; there will\r\nalways exist in the mind a degree of uncertainty; a disposition to look\r\nupon philosophy as a vain pretension; a something almost antagonistic\r\nto the highest aspirations in which humanity can indulge, unless the\r\npractice of theorising be given up, and the method of simple inquiry,\r\nthe “zetetic” process be adopted. “Nature speaks to us in a peculiar\r\nlanguage; in the language of phenomena, she answers at all times the\r\nquestions which are put to her; and such questions are experiments.”[2]\r\nNot experiments only which corroborate what has previously been\r\n_assumed_ to be true; but experiments in every form bearing on the\r\nsubject of inquiry, before a conclusion is drawn or premises affirmed.\r\n\r\n  [2] “Liebig’s Agricultural Chemistry,” p. 39.\r\n\r\nWe have an excellent example of zetetic reasoning in an arithmetical\r\noperation; more especially so in what is called the “Golden Rule,” or\r\nthe “Rule-of-Three.” If one hundred weight of any article is worth a\r\ngiven sum, what will some other weight of that article be worth? The\r\nseparate figures may be considered as the elements or facts of the\r\ninquiry; the placing and working of these as the logical arrangement;\r\nand the quotient or answer as the fair and natural deduction. Hence,\r\nin every zetetic process, the conclusion arrived at is essentially a\r\nquotient, which, if the details be correct, must, of necessity, be true\r\nbeyond the reach or power of contradiction.\r\n\r\nIn our courts of Justice we have also an example of the zetetic\r\nprocess. A prisoner is placed at the bar; evidence for and against\r\nhim is advanced; it is carefully arranged and patiently considered;\r\nand only such a verdict given as could not in justice be avoided.\r\nSociety would not tolerate any other procedure; it would brand with\r\ninfamy whoever should assume a prisoner to be guilty, and prohibit all\r\nevidence but such as would corroborate the assumption. Yet such is the\r\ncharacter of theoretical philosophy!\r\n\r\nThe zetetic process is also the natural method of investigation; nature\r\nherself teaches it. Children invariably seek information by asking\r\nquestions--by earnestly inquiring from those around them. Question\r\nafter question in rapid and exciting succession will often proceed\r\nfrom a child, until the most profound in learning and philosophy will\r\nfeel puzzled to reply. If then both nature and justice, as well as the\r\ncommon sense and practical experience of mankind demand, and will not\r\nbe content with less or other than the zetetic process, why should it\r\nbe ignored and violated by the learned in philosophy? Let the practice\r\nof theorising be cast aside as one fatal to the full development of\r\ntruth; oppressive to the reasoning power; and in every sense inimical\r\nto the progress and permanent improvement of the human race.\r\n\r\nIf then we adopt the zetetic process to ascertain the true figure\r\nand condition of the Earth, we shall find that instead of its being\r\na globe, and moving in space, it is the directly contrary--A PLANE;\r\nwithout motion, and unaccompanied by anything in the Firmament\r\nanalogous to itself.\r\n\r\nIf the Earth is a globe, and 25,000 miles in circumference, the surface\r\nof all standing water must have a certain degree of convexity--every\r\npart must be an arc of a circle, curvating from the summit at the\r\nrate of 8 inches per mile multiplied by the square of the distance.\r\nThat this may be sufficiently understood, the following quotation is\r\ngiven from the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, art. “Levelling.” “If a\r\nline which crosses the plumb-line at right angles be continued for\r\nany considerable length it will rise above the Earth’s surface (the\r\nEarth being globular); and this rising will be as the square of the\r\ndistance to which the said right line is produced; that is to say, it\r\nis raised eight inches very nearly above the Earth’s surface at one\r\nmile’s distance; four times as much, or 32 inches, at the distance\r\nof two miles; nine times as much, or 72 inches, at the distance of\r\nthree miles. This is owing to the globular figure of the Earth, and\r\nthis rising is the difference between the true and apparent levels;\r\nthe curve of the Earth being the true level, and the tangent to it\r\nthe apparent level. So soon does the difference between the true and\r\napparent levels become perceptible that it is necessary to make an\r\nallowance for it if the distance betwixt the two stations exceeds two\r\nchains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nLet B. D. be a small portion of the Earth’s circumference, whose centre\r\nof curvature is A. and consequently all the points of this arc will be\r\non a level. But a tangent B. C. meeting the vertical line A. D. in C.\r\nwill be the apparent level at the point B. and therefore D. C. is the\r\ndifference between the apparent and the true level at the point B.\r\n\r\nThe distance C. D. must be deducted from the observed height to have\r\nthe true difference of level; or the differences between the distances\r\nof two points from the surface of the Earth or from the centre of\r\ncurvature A. But we shall afterwards see how this correction may be\r\navoided altogether in certain cases. To find an expression for C. D.\r\nwe have Euclid, third book, 36 prop. which proves that B. C² = C. D.\r\n(2 _A D_ × _C D_); but since in all cases of levelling C. D. is\r\nexceedingly small compared with 2 A. D., we may safely neglect C. D²\r\nand then B C² = 2 A. D × C. D. or\r\n\r\n          B. C²\r\n  C. D = ------.\r\n         2 A. D\r\n\r\nHence the depression of the true level is equal to the square of the\r\ndistance divided by twice the radius of the curvature of the Earth.\r\n\r\nFor example, taking a distance of four miles, the square of 4 = 16,\r\nand putting down twice the radius of the Earth’s curvature as in round\r\nfigures about 8000 miles, we make the depression on four miles\r\n\r\n     16              16 × 1760         176         528\r\n  = ---- of a mile = --------- yards = --- yards = --- feet,\r\n    8000                8000            50          50\r\n\r\nor rather better than 10¹⁄₂ feet.\r\n\r\nOr, if we take the mean radius of the Earth as the mean radius of its\r\ncurvature, and consequently 2 A. D = 7,912 miles, then 5,280 feet being\r\n1 mile, we shall have C. D. the depression in inches\r\n\r\n    5280 × 12 × B C²\r\n  = ---------------- = 8008 B. C² inches.\r\n          7912\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks suppose the visual ray C. B. to be a straight\r\nline, whereas on account of the unequal densities of the air at\r\ndifferent distances from the Earth, the rays of light are incurvated\r\nby refraction. The effect of this is to lessen the difference between\r\nthe true and apparent levels, but in such an extremely variable and\r\nuncertain manner that if any constant or fixed allowance is made for\r\nit in formulæ or tables, it will often lead to a greater error than\r\nwhat it was intended to obviate. For though the refraction may at a\r\nmean compensate for about a seventh of the curvature of the earth, it\r\nsometimes exceeds a fifth, and at other times does not amount to a\r\nfifteenth. We have, therefore, made no allowance for refraction in the\r\nforegone formulæ.”\r\n\r\nIf the Earth is a globe, there cannot be a question that, however\r\nirregular the _land_ may be in form, the _water_ must have a convex\r\nsurface. And as the difference between the true and apparent level, or\r\nthe degree of curvature would be 8 inches in one mile, and in every\r\nsucceeding mile 8 inches multiplied by the square of the distance,\r\nthere can be no difficulty in detecting either its actual existence\r\nor proportion. Experiments made upon the sea have been objected to on\r\naccount of its constantly-changing altitude; and the existence of banks\r\nand channels which produce a “a crowding” of the waters, currents, and\r\nother irregularities. Standing water has therefore been selected, and\r\nmany important experiments have been made, the most simple of which\r\nis the following:--In the county of Cambridge there is an artificial\r\nriver or canal, called the “Old Bedford.” It is upwards of twenty\r\nmiles long, and passes in a straight line through that part of the\r\nfens called the “Bedford level” The water is nearly stationery--often\r\nentirely so, and throughout its entire length has no interruption from\r\nlocks or water-gates; so that it is in every respect well adapted for\r\nascertaining whether any and what amount of convexity really exists.\r\nA boat with a flag standing three feet above the water, was directed\r\nto sail from a place called “Welney Bridge,” to another place called\r\n“Welche’s Dam.” These two points are six statute miles apart. The\r\nobserver, with a good telescope, was seated in the water as a bather\r\n(it being the summer season), with the eye not exceeding eight inches\r\nabove the surface. The flag and the boat down to the water’s edge were\r\nclearly _visible throughout the whole distance!_ From this observation\r\nit was concluded that the water did not decline to any degree from the\r\nline of sight; whereas the water would be 6 feet higher in the centre\r\nof the arc of 6 miles extent than at the two places Welney Bridge and\r\nWelche’s Dam; but as the eye of the observer was only eight inches\r\nabove the water, the highest point of the surface would be at one mile\r\nfrom the place of observation; below which point the surface of the\r\nwater at the end of the remaining five miles would be 16 feet 8 inches\r\n(5² × 8 = 200 inches). This will be rendered clear by the following\r\ndiagram:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nLet A B represent the arc of water from Welney Bridge to Welche’s Dam,\r\nsix miles in length; and A L the line of sight, which is now a tangent\r\nto the arc A B; the point of contact, T, is 1 mile from the eye of the\r\nobserver at A; and from T to the boat at B is 5 miles; the square of 5\r\nmiles multiplied by 8 inches is 200 inches, or, in other words, that\r\nthe boat at B would have been 200 inches or above 16 feet below the\r\nsurface of the water at T; and the flag on the boat, which was 3 feet\r\nhigh, would have been 13 feet below the line-of-sight, A T L!!\r\n\r\nFrom this experiment it follows that the surface of standing water is\r\n_not convex_, and therefore _that the Earth_ IS NOT A GLOBE! On the\r\nContrary, this simple experiment is all-sufficient to prove that the\r\nsurface of the water is parallel to the line-of-sight, and is therefore\r\nhorizontal, and that the Earth _cannot_ be other than A PLANE! In\r\ndiagram Figure 3 this is perfectly illustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nA B is the line-of-sight, and C D the surface of the water equidistant\r\nfrom or parallel to it throughout the whole distance observed.\r\n\r\nAlthough, on account of the variable state of the water, objections\r\nhave been raised to experiments made upon the sea-shore to test the\r\nconvexity of the flood or ebb-tide level, none can be urged against\r\nobservations made from higher altitudes. For example,--the distance\r\nacross the Irish Sea between Douglas Harbour, in the Isle of Man, and\r\nthe Great Orm’s Head in North Wales is 60 miles. If the earth is a\r\nglobe, the surface of the water would form an arc 60 miles in length,\r\nthe centre of which would be 1,944 feet higher than the coast line\r\nat either end, so that an observer would be obliged to attain this\r\naltitude before he could see the Welsh coast from the Isle of Man: as\r\nshown in the diagram, Figure 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known, however, that from an altitude not exceeding 100 feet\r\nthe Great Orm’s Head is visible in clear weather from Douglas Harbour.\r\nThe altitude of 100 feet could cause the line of sight to touch the\r\nhorizon at the distance of nearly 13 miles; and from the horizon to\r\nOrm’s Head being 47 miles, the square of this number multiplied by 8\r\ninches gives 1472 feet as the distance which the Welsh coast line would\r\nbe below the line of sight B C.--A representing the Great Orm’s Head,\r\nwhich, being 600 feet high, its summit would be 872 feet below the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nMany similar experiments have been made across St. George’s Channel,\r\nbetween points near Dublin and Holyhead, and always with results\r\nentirely incompatible with the doctrine of rotundity.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is known that the horizon at sea, whatever distance it may\r\nextend to the right and left of the observer on land, always appears\r\nas a straight line. The following experiment has been tried in various\r\nparts of the country. At Brighton, on a rising ground near the race\r\ncourse, two poles were fixed in the earth six yards apart, and directly\r\nopposite the sea. Between these poles a line was tightly stretched\r\nparallel to the distant horizon. From the centre of the line the view\r\nembraced not less than 20 miles on each side, making a distance of 40\r\nmiles. A vessel was observed sailing directly westwards; the line cut\r\nthe rigging a little above the bulwarks, which it did for several hours\r\nor until the vessel had sailed the whole distance of 40 miles. This\r\nwill be understood by reference to the diagram, Figure 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nIf the Earth were a globe, the appearance would be as represented in\r\nFigure 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe ship coming into view from the east would have to ascend an\r\ninclined plane for 20 miles until it arrived at the centre of the arc\r\nA B, whence it would have to descend for the same distance. The square\r\nof 20 miles multiplied by 8 inches gives 266 feet as the amount the\r\nvessel would be below the line C D at the beginning and at the end of\r\nthe 40 miles.\r\n\r\nIf we stand upon the deck of a ship, or mount to the mast head; or go\r\nto the top of a mountain, or ascend above the Earth in a balloon, and\r\nlook over the sea, the surface appears as a vast inclined plane rising\r\nup until in the distance it intercepts the line of sight. If a good\r\nmirror be held in the opposite direction, the horizon will be reflected\r\nas a well-defined mark or line across the centre, as represented in\r\ndiagram, Figure 7.\r\n\r\nAscending or descending, the distant horizon does the same. It rises\r\nand falls with the observer, and is always on a level with his eye. If\r\nhe takes a position where the water surrounds him--as at the mast-head\r\nof a ship out of sight of land, or on the summit of a small island\r\nfar from the mainland, the surface of the sea appears to rise up on\r\nall sides equally and to surround him like the walls of an immense\r\namphitheatre. He seems to be in the centre of a large concavity,\r\nthe edges of which expand or contract as he takes a higher or lower\r\nposition. This appearance is so well known to sea-going travellers that\r\nnothing more need be said in its support. But the appearance from a\r\nballoon is familiar only to a small number of observers, and therefore\r\nit will be useful to quote from those who have written upon the subject.\r\n\r\n  “_The Apparent Concavity of the Earth as seen from a Balloon._--A\r\n  perfectly-formed circle encompassed the visible planisphere beneath,\r\n  or rather the concavo-sphere it might now be called, for I had\r\n  attained a height from which the surface of the Earth assumed a\r\n  regularly hollowed or concave appearance--an optical illusion\r\n  which increases as you recede from it. At the greatest elevation I\r\n  attained, which was about a mile-and-a-half, the appearance of the\r\n  World around me assumed a shape or form like that which is made\r\n  by placing two watch-glasses together by their edges, the balloon\r\n  apparently in the central cavity all the time of its flight at that\r\n  elevation.”--_Wise’s Aeronautics._\r\n\r\n  “Another curious effect of the aerial ascent was, that the Earth,\r\n  when we were at our greatest altitude, positively appeared _concave_,\r\n  looking like a huge dark bowl, rather than the convex sphere such\r\n  as we naturally expect to see it. * * * The horizon always appears\r\n  to be on a level with our eye, and seems to rise as we rise, until\r\n  at length the elevation of the circular boundary line of the sight\r\n  becomes so marked that the Earth assumes the anomalous appearance as\r\n  we have said of a _concave_ rather than a _convex_ body.”--_Mayhew’s\r\n  Great World of London._\r\n\r\nMr. Elliott, an American æronaut, in a letter giving an account of his\r\nascension from Baltimore, thus speaks of the appearance of the Earth\r\nfrom a balloon:--\r\n\r\n  “I don’t know that I ever hinted heretofore that the æronaut may\r\n  well be the most sceptical man about the rotundity of the Earth.\r\n  Philosophy imposes the truth upon us; but the view of the Earth\r\n  from the elevation of a balloon is that of an immense terrestrial\r\n  basin, the deeper part of which is that directly under one’s feet.\r\n  As we ascend, the Earth beneath us seems to recede--actually to sink\r\n  away--while the horizon gradually and gracefully lifts a diversified\r\n  slope stretching away farther and farther to a line that, at the\r\n  highest elevation, seems to close with the sky. Thus upon a clear\r\n  day, the æronaut feels as if suspended at about an equal distance\r\n  between the vast blue oceanic concave above, and the equally expanded\r\n  terrestrial basin below.”\r\n\r\n  “The chief peculiarity of the view from a balloon, at a considerable\r\n  elevation, was the altitude of the horizon, which remained\r\n  practically on a level with the eye at an elevation of two miles,\r\n  causing the surface of the Earth to appear _concave_ instead of\r\n  _convex_, and to recede during the rapid ascent, whilst the horizon\r\n  and the balloon seemed to be stationary.”--_London Journal_, July 18,\r\n  1857.\r\n\r\nDuring the important balloon ascents recently made for scientific\r\npurposes by Mr. Coxwell and Mr. Glaisher, of the Royal Greenwich\r\nObservatory, the same phenomenon was observed--\r\n\r\n  “The horizon always appeared on a level with the car.”--Vide\r\n  “Glaisher’s Report.”\r\n\r\nThe following diagram represents this appearance:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the earth C D appears to rise to the line-of-sight from\r\nthe balloon, and “seems to close with the sky” at the points H H in\r\nthe same manner that the ceiling and the floor of a long room, or the\r\ntop and bottom of a tunnel appear to approach each other, and from the\r\nsame cause, viz.: that they are _parallel to the line-of-sight, and\r\ntherefore horizontal_.\r\n\r\nIf the Earth’s surface were convex the observer, looking from a\r\nballoon, instead of seeing it gradually ascend to the level of the eye,\r\nwould have to look downwards to the horizon H H, as represented in\r\nfigure 9, and the amount of dip in the line-of-sight C H would be the\r\ngreatest at the highest elevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nMany more experiments have been made than are here described, but the\r\nselection now given is amply sufficient to prove that the surface of\r\nwater is horizontal, and that the Earth, taken as a whole, its land and\r\nwater together, is not a globe, has really no degree of sphericity; but\r\nis “to all intents and purposes” A PLANE!\r\n\r\nIf we now consider the fact that when we travel by land or sea, and\r\nfrom any part of the known world, in a direction towards the North\r\npolar star, we shall arrive at one and the same point, we are forced\r\nto the conclusion that what has hitherto been called the North Polar\r\nregion, is really THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH. That from this northern\r\ncentre the land diverges and stretches out, of necessity, towards a\r\ncircumference, which must now be called THE SOUTHERN REGION: which is\r\na vast circle, and not a pole or centre. That there is ONE CENTRE--THE\r\nNORTH, and ONE CIRCUMFERENCE--THE SOUTH. This language will be better\r\nunderstood by reference to the diagram Figure 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nN represents the northern centre; and S S S the southern\r\ncircumference--both icy or frozen regions. That the south is an\r\nimmense ring, or glacial boundary, is evident from the fact, that\r\nwithin the antarctic circle the most experienced, scientific, and\r\ndaring navigators have failed in their attempts to sail, in a direct\r\nmanner, completely round it. Lieut. Wilkes, of the American Navy, after\r\ngreat and prolonged efforts, and much confusion in his reckoning, and\r\nseeing no prospect of success, was obliged to give up his attempt and\r\nreturn to the north. This he acknowledged in a letter to Captain Sir\r\nJames Clarke Ross, with whose intention to explore the south seas he\r\nhad become acquainted, in which the following words occur: “I hope\r\nyou intend to circumnavigate the antarctic circle. I made 70 degrees\r\nof it.” Captain Ross, however, was himself greatly confused in his\r\nattempts to navigate the southern region. In his account of the voyage\r\nhe says, at page 96--“We found ourselves every day from 12 to 16 miles\r\nby observation in advance of our reckoning.” “By our observations\r\nwe found ourselves 58 miles to the eastward of our reckoning in two\r\ndays.” And in this and other ways all the great navigators have been\r\nfrustrated in their efforts, and have been more or less confounded in\r\ntheir attempts to sail round the Earth upon or beyond the antarctic\r\ncircle. But if the southern region is a pole or centre, like the\r\nnorth, there would be little difficulty in circumnavigating it, for\r\nthe distance round would be comparatively small. When it is seen that\r\nthe Earth is not a sphere, but a plane, having only one centre, the\r\nnorth; and that the south is the vast icy boundary of the world, the\r\ndifficulties experienced by circumnavigators can be easily understood.\r\n\r\nHaving given a surface or bird’s-eye view of the Earth, the following\r\nsectional representation will aid in completing the description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nE E represents the Earth; W W the “great deep,” or the waters which\r\nsurround the land; N the northern centre; and S S sections of the\r\nsouthern ice. As the present description is purely zetetic, and as\r\nevery fact must therefore have its fullest value assigned to it, and\r\nits consequences represented, a peculiarity must be pointed out in the\r\nforegoing diagram. It will be observed that from about the points E E\r\nthe surface of the water rises towards the south S S. It is clearly\r\nascertained that the altitude of the water in various parts of the\r\nworld is much influenced by the pressure of the atmosphere--however\r\nthis pressure is caused--and it is well known that the atmospheric\r\npressure in the south is constantly less than it is in the north, and\r\ntherefore the water in the southern region must always be considerably\r\nhigher than it is in the northern. Hence the peculiarity referred to\r\nin the diagram. The following quotation from Sir James Ross’s voyages,\r\np. 483, will corroborate the above statements:--“Our barometrical\r\nexperiments appear to prove that a gradual diminution of atmospheric\r\npressure occurs as we proceed southwards from the tropic of Capricorn.\r\n* * * It has hitherto been considered that the mean pressure of the\r\natmosphere at the level of the sea was nearly the same in all parts of\r\nthe world, as no material difference occurs between the equator and\r\nthe highest northern latitudes. * * * The causes of the atmospheric\r\npressure being so _very much less_ in the southern than in the northern\r\nhemispheres remains to be determined.”\r\n\r\nThus, putting all theories aside, we have seen that direct experiment\r\ndemonstrates the important truth, _that the Earth is an extended\r\nPlane_. Literally, “Stretched out upon the waters;” “Founded on the\r\nseas and established on the floods;” “Standing in the water and out\r\nof the water.” How far the southern icy region extends horizontally,\r\nor how deep the waters upon and in which the earth stands or is\r\nsupported are questions which cannot yet be answered. In Zetetic\r\nphilosophy the foundation must be well secured, progress must be made\r\nstep by step, making good the ground as we proceed; and whenever a\r\ndifficulty presents itself, or evidence fails to carry us farther,\r\nwe must promptly and candidly acknowledge it, and prepare for future\r\ninvestigation; but never fill up the inquiry by theory and assumption.\r\nIn the present instance there is no practical evidence as to the extent\r\nof the southern ice and the “great deep.” Who shall say whether the\r\ndepth and extent of the “mighty waters” _have_ a limit, or constitute\r\nthe “World without end?”\r\n\r\nHaving advanced direct and special evidence that the surface of the\r\nearth is not convex, but, on the contrary, a vast and irregular plane,\r\nit now becomes important that the leading phenomena upon which the\r\ndoctrine of rotundity has been founded should be carefully examined.\r\nFirst, it is contended that because the hull of an outward-bound vessel\r\ndisappears before the mast head, the water is convex, and therefore the\r\nEarth is a globe. In this conclusion, however, there is an assumption\r\ninvolved, viz., that such a phenomenon _can only_ result from a convex\r\nsurface. Inquiry will show that this is erroneous. If we select for\r\nobservation a few miles of straight and level railway, we shall\r\nfind that the rails, which are parallel, appear in the distance to\r\napproach each other. But the two rails which are nearest together do\r\nso more rapidly than those which are farthest asunder, as shown in the\r\nfollowing diagram, Figure 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nLet the observer stand at the point A, looking in the direction of the\r\narrows; and the rails 1.2.3.4. will appear to join at the point B, but\r\nthe rail 5.6 will appear to have converged only as far as C towards B.\r\n\r\nAgain, let a train be watched from the point A in Figure 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe observer looking from A, with his eye midway between the bottom\r\nof the carriage and the rail, will see the diameter of the wheels\r\ngradually diminish as they recede. The lines 1.2 and 1.4 will appear to\r\napproach each other until at the point B they will come together, and\r\nthe space, including the wheels, between the bottom of the carriage\r\nand the rail will there disappear. The floor of the carriage will seem\r\nto be sliding without wheels upon the rail 1.2; but the lines 5.6 and\r\n7.8 will yet have converged only to C and D.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon may be observed with a long row of lamps, where the\r\nground is a straight line throughout its entire length as represented\r\nin Figure 14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nThe lines 1.2 and A D will converge at the point D and the pedestal of\r\nthe lamp at D will seem to have disappeared, but the line 3.4, which\r\nrepresents the true altitude of the lamps, will only have converged to\r\nthe point C.\r\n\r\nA narrow bank running along the side of a straight portion of railway,\r\nupon which poles are placed for supporting the wires of the electric\r\ntelegraph will produce the same appearance, as shown in Figure 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe bank having the altitude 1.3 and 2.4 will, in the distance of two\r\nor three miles (according to its depth) disappear to the eye of an\r\nobserver placed at Figure 1; and the telegraph pole at Figure 2 will\r\nseem not to stand upon a bank at all, but upon the actual railway. The\r\nline 3.4 will merge into the line 1.2 at the point B, while the line\r\n5.6 will only have descended to the position C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nMany other familiar instances could be given to show the true law of\r\nperspective; which is, that parallel lines appear in the distance\r\nto converge to one and the same datum line, but to reach it at\r\ndifferent distances if themselves dissimilarly distant. This law being\r\nremembered, it is easy to understand how the hull of an outward-bound\r\nship, although sailing upon a plane surface disappears before the\r\nmast-head. In Figure 16, let A B represent the surface of the water;\r\nC H the line of sight; and E D the altitude of the mast-head. Then,\r\nas A B and C H are nearer to each other than A B and E D, they will\r\nconverge and appear to meet at the point H, which is the practical,\r\nor, as it would be better to call it, the _optical_ horizon. The hull\r\nof the vessel being contained within the lines A B and C H, must\r\ngradually diminish as these converge, until at H, or the horizon,\r\nit enters the vanishing point and disappears; but the mast-head\r\nrepresented by the line E D is still _above_ the horizon at H, and will\r\nrequire to sail more or less, according to its altitude, beyond the\r\npoint H before it sinks to the line C H, or, in other words, before the\r\nlines A B and E D form the same angle as A B and C H.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident also that should the elevation of the observer be\r\ngreater than at C, the horizon or vanishing point would not be formed\r\nat H, but at a greater distance; and therefore the hull of the vessel\r\nwould be longer visible. Or, if, when the hull has disappeared at H,\r\nthe observer ascends from the elevation at C to a higher position\r\nnearer to E, it will again be seen. Thus all these phenomena which have\r\nso long been considered as proofs of the Earth’s rotundity are really\r\noptical sequences of the contrary doctrine. To argue that because the\r\nlower part of an outward-bound ship disappears before the highest the\r\nwater must be round, is to _assume_ that a _round_ surface _only_\r\ncan produce this effect! But it is now shown that a _plane_ surface\r\n_necessarily_ produces this effect; and therefore the assumption is\r\nnot required, and the argument involved is fallacious!\r\n\r\nIt may here be observed that no help can be given to this doctrine of\r\nrotundity by quoting the prevailing theory of perspective. The law\r\nrepresented in the foregoing diagrams is the “law of nature.” It may\r\nbe seen in every layer of a long wall, in every hedge and bank of the\r\nroadside, and indeed in every direction where lines and objects run\r\nparallel to each other; but no illustration of the contrary perspective\r\nis ever to be seen! except in the distorted pictures, otherwise\r\ncleverly and beautifully drawn as they are, which abound in our public\r\nand private collections.\r\n\r\nThe theory which affirms that parallel lines converge only to one and\r\nthe same point upon the eye-line is an error. It is true only of lines\r\nequidistant from the eye-line. It is true that parallel lines converge\r\nto one and the same _eye-line_, but _meet it at different distances\r\nwhen more or less apart from each other_. This is the true law of\r\nperspective as shown by Nature herself; any other idea is fallacious\r\nand will deceive whoever may hold and apply it to practice.\r\n\r\nAs it is of great importance that the difference should be clearly\r\nunderstood, the following diagram is given. Let E L (Figure 17)\r\nrepresent the eye-line and C the vanishing point of the lines, 1 C 2\r\nC; then the lines 3.4.5.6, although converging _somewhere_ to the line\r\nE L, will not do so to the point C, but 3 and 4 will proceed to D and 5\r\nand 6 to H. It is repeated, that lines _equidistant_ from the _datum_\r\nwill converge on the _same point_ and at the _same distance_; but lines\r\n_not_ equidistant will converge on the same _datum_ but at _different\r\ndistances_! A very good illustration of the difference is given in\r\nFigure 18. Theoretic perspective would bring the lines 1, 2, and 3 to\r\nthe same _datum_ line E L and to the _same point_ A. But the true\r\nor natural law would bring the lines 2 and 3 to the point A because\r\nequidistant from the eye-line E L; but the line 1 being farther from\r\nE L than either 2 or 3, would be taken beyond the point A on towards C,\r\nuntil it formed the _same angle_ upon the line E L as 2 and 3 form at\r\nthe point A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe subject of perspective will not be rendered sufficiently clear\r\nunless an explanation be given of the cause and character of what is\r\ntechnically called the “vanishing point.” Why do objects, even when\r\nraised above the earth, vanish at a given distance? It is known,\r\nand can easily be proved by experiment, that “the range of the eye,\r\nor diameter of the field of vision is 110°; consequently this is\r\nthe _largest_ angle under which an object can be seen. The range of\r\nvision is from 110° to 1°. * * The _smallest_ angle under which an\r\nobject can be seen is upon an average for different sights the 60th\r\npart of a degree, or _one minute_ in space; so that when an object is\r\nremoved from the eye 3000 times its own diameter, it will only just\r\nbe distinguishable; consequently, the greatest distance at which we\r\ncan behold an object, like a shilling, of an inch in diameter is 3000\r\ninches or 250 feet.”[3] It may, therefore, be very easily understood\r\nthat a line passing over the hull of a ship, and continuing parallel\r\nto the surface of the water, must converge to the vanishing point at\r\nthe distance of about 3000 times its own elevation; in other words,\r\nif the surface of the hull be 10 feet above the water it will vanish\r\nat 3,000 times 10 feet; or nearly six statute miles; but if the\r\nmast-head be 30 feet above the water, it will be visible for 90,000\r\nfeet or over 17 miles; so that it could be seen upon the horizon for\r\na distance of eleven miles _after the hull had entered the vanishing\r\npoint_! Hence the phenomenon of a receding ship’s hull being the\r\nfirst to disappear, which has been so universally quoted and relied\r\nupon as proving the rotundity of the Earth is fairly and logically\r\na proof of the very contrary! It has been misapplied in consequence\r\nof an erroneous view of the law of perspective, and the desire to\r\nsupport a theory. That it is valueless for such a purpose has already\r\nbeen shown; and that, even if there were no question of the Earth’s\r\nform involved, it could not arise from the convexity of the water, is\r\nproved by the following experiment:--Let an observer stand upon the\r\nsea-shore with the eye at an elevation of about six feet above the\r\nwater, and watch a vessel until it is just “hull down.” If now a good\r\ntelescope be applied the hull will be distinctly _restored to sight_!\r\nFrom which it must be concluded that it had disappeared through the\r\ninfluence of perspective, and not from having sunk behind the summit\r\nof a convex surface! Had it done so it would follow that the telescope\r\nhad either carried the line-of-sight through the mass of water, or over\r\nits surface and down the other side! But the power of “looking round a\r\ncorner” or penetrating a dense and extensive medium has never yet been\r\nattributed to such an instrument! If the elevation of the observer be\r\nmuch greater than six feet the distance at which the vanishing point is\r\nformed will be so great that the telescope may not have power enough to\r\nmagnify or enlarge the angle constituting it; when the experiment would\r\nappear to fail. But the failure would only be apparent, for a telescope\r\nof sufficient power to magnify at the horizon or vanishing point would\r\ncertainly restore the hull at the greater distance.\r\n\r\n  [3] “Wonders of Science,” by Mayhew, p. 357.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nAn illustration or proof of the Earth’s rotundity is also supposed to\r\nbe found in the fact that navigators by sailing due east or west return\r\nin the opposite direction. Here, again, a supposition is involved,\r\nviz., that upon a globe _only_ could this occur. But it is easy to\r\nprove that it could take place as perfectly upon a circular plane\r\nas upon a sphere. Let it first be clearly understood what is really\r\nmeant by sailing _due east and west_. Practically it is sailing at\r\nright angles to north and south: this is determined ordinarily by the\r\nmariners’ compass, but more accurately by the meridian lines which\r\nconverge to the northern centre of the Earth. Bearing this in mind,\r\nlet N in Figure 19 represent the northern centre; and the lines N. S.\r\nthe directions north and south. Then let the small arrow, Figure 1,\r\nrepresent a vessel on the meridian of Greenwich, with its head W. at\r\nright angles, or due west; and the stern E due east. It is evident that\r\nin passing to the position of the arrow, Figure 2, which is still\r\ndue west or square to the meridian, the arc 1.2 must be described;\r\nand in sailing still farther under the same condition, the arcs 2.3,\r\n3.4, and 4.1 will be successively passed over until the meridian of\r\nGreenwich, Figure 1, is arrived at, which was the point of departure.\r\nThus a mariner, by keeping the head of his vessel due west, or at right\r\nangles to the north and south, practically circumnavigates a plane\r\nsurface; or, in other words, he describes a circle _upon a plane_,\r\nat a greater or lesser distance from the centre N, and being at all\r\ntimes square to the radii north and south, he is _compelled_ to do\r\nso--_because_ the earth is a plane, having a central region, towards\r\nwhich the compass and the meridian lines which guide him, converge. So\r\nfar, then, from the fact of a vessel sailing due west coming home from\r\nthe east, and _vice versa_, being a proof of the earth’s rotundity, it\r\nis simply a phenomenon, consistent with and dependent upon its being\r\na plane! The subject may be perfectly illustrated by the following\r\nsimple experiment:--Take a round table, fix a pin in the centre; to\r\nthis attach a thread, and extend it to the edge. Call the centre the\r\nnorth and the circumference the south; then, at any distance between\r\nthe centre and the circumference, a direction at right angles to the\r\nthread will be due east and west; and a small object, as a pencil,\r\nplaced across or square to the thread, to represent a ship, may be\r\ncarried completely round the table without its right-angled position\r\nbeing altered; or, the right-angled position firmly maintained, the\r\nvessel must of necessity describe a circle on being moved from right\r\nto left or left to right. Referring again to the diagram, Figure 19,\r\nthe vessel may sail from the north towards the south, upon the meridian\r\nFigure 1, and there turning due west, may pass Cape Horn, represented\r\nby D, and continue its westerly course until it passes the point C, or\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and again reaches the meridian, Figure 1, upon\r\nwhich it may return to the north. Those, then, who hold that the earth\r\nis a globe because it can be circumnavigated, have an argument which\r\nis logically incomplete and fallacious. This will be seen at once by\r\nputting it in the syllogistic form:--\r\n\r\n  A globe _only_ can be circumnavigated:\r\n\r\n  The Earth has been circumnavigated:\r\n\r\n  Therefore the Earth is a globe.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that a _plane_ can be circumnavigated, and therefore\r\nthe first or major proposition is false; and, being so, the conclusion\r\nis false. This portion of the subject furnishes a striking instance\r\nof the necessity of, at all times, proving a proposition by direct\r\nand immediate evidence, instead of quoting a natural phenomenon as a\r\nproof of what has previously been assumed. But a theory will not admit\r\nof this method, and therefore the zetetic process, or inquiry before\r\nconclusion, entirely eschewing assumption, is the only course which\r\ncan lead to simple and unalterable truth. Whoever creates or upholds a\r\ntheory, adopts a monster which will sooner or later betray and enslave\r\nhim, or make him ridiculous in the eyes of practical observers.\r\n\r\nClosely following the subject of circumnavigation, the gain and loss\r\nof time discovered on sailing east and west is referred to as another\r\nproof of rotundity. But this illustration is equally fallacious with\r\nthe last, and from the same cause, viz., the assumption that a _globe\r\nonly_ could produce the effect observed. It will be seen, by reference\r\nto diagram, Figure 19, that the effect must take place equally upon a\r\nplane as upon a globe. Let the ship, W E, upon the meridian, Figure 1,\r\nat 12 at noon, begin to sail towards the position, Figure 2, which it\r\nwill reach the next day at 12, or in 24 hours: the sun during the same\r\n24 hours will have returned only to Figure 1, and will require to move\r\nfor another hour or more until it reaches the ship at Figure 2, making\r\n25 hours instead of 24, in which the sun would have returned to the\r\nship, if it had remained at Figure 1. In this way, the sun is more and\r\nmore behind the meridian time of the ship, as it proceeds day after day\r\nupon its westerly course, so that on completing the circumnavigation\r\nthe ship’s time is a day later than the solar time, reckoning to and\r\nfrom the meridian of Greenwich. But the contrary follows if the ship\r\nsails from Figure 1 towards Figure 4, or the east, because it will meet\r\nthe sun one hour earlier than the 24 hours which would be required for\r\nit to pass on to Figure 1. Hence, on completing the circle 1.4.3.2.1,\r\nthe time at the ship would be one day in advance of the time at\r\nGreenwich, or the position Figure 1. Captain Sir J. C. Ross, at page\r\n132, vol. 2, says--“November 25, having by sailing to the eastward\r\ngained 12 hours, it became necessary, on crossing the 180th degree and\r\nentering upon west longitude, in order to have our time correspond with\r\nthat of England, to have two days following of the same date, and by\r\nthis means lose the time we had gained, and still were gaining, as we\r\nsailed to the eastward.”\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of this matter, and to impress the mind of the\r\nreaders with its importance as an evidence in support of the theory\r\nof the earth’s sphericity, several authors have given the following\r\nstory:--Two brothers, twins, born within a few minutes of each other,\r\nand therefore of the same age, on growing to manhood went to sea. They\r\nboth circumnavigated the earth, but in opposite directions; and when\r\nthey again met, one was a day older than the other!\r\n\r\nWhatever truth there may be in this account, it is here shown to be no\r\nmore favourable to the idea of rotundity than it is to the opposite\r\nfact that the earth is a plane; as both forms will permit of the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon supposed to prove rotundity, is found in the fact\r\nthat Polaris, or the north polar star, gradually sinks to the horizon\r\nas the mariner approaches the equator, on passing which it becomes\r\ninvisible. First, it is an ordinary effect of perspective for an object\r\nto appear lower and lower as the observer recedes. Let any one try\r\nthe experiment of looking at a lighthouse, church spire, monument,\r\ngas-lamp, or other elevated object, from the distance of a few yards,\r\nand notice the angle at which it is observed: on going farther away,\r\nthe angle will diminish and the object appear lower, until, if the\r\ndistance be sufficiently great, the line-of-sight to the object, and\r\nthe apparently ascending surface of the Earth upon which it stands\r\nwill converge to the angle which constitutes the vanishing point; at\r\na single yard beyond which it will be invisible. This, then, is the\r\nnecessary result of the everywhere visible law of perspective operating\r\nbetween the eye-line and the plane surface upon which the object\r\nstands; and has no relation whatever to rotundity.\r\n\r\nIt is not denied that a similar depression of a distant object would\r\ntake place upon a globe; it is simply contended that it would not occur\r\nupon a globe exclusively. But if the Earth is a sphere and the pole\r\nstar hangs over the northern axis, it would be impossible to see it for\r\na single degree beyond the equator, or 90 degrees from the pole. The\r\nline-of-sight would become a tangent to the sphere, and consequently\r\nseveral thousand miles out of and divergent from the direction of the\r\npole-star. Many cases, however, are on record of the north polar star\r\nbeing visible far beyond the equator, as far even as the tropic of\r\nCapricorn. In the _Times_ newspaper of May 13, 1862, under the head of\r\n“Naval and Military Intelligence,” it is stated that Captain Wilkins\r\ndistinctly saw the Southern Cross and the polar star at midnight in\r\n23·53 degrees of latitude, and longitude 35·46.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nThis would be utterly impossible if the Earth were a globe, as shown\r\nin the diagram, Figure 20. Let N represent the north pole, E E the\r\nequator, C C the tropic of Capricorn, and P the polar star. It will\r\nbe evident that the line-of-sight C D being a tangent to the Earth\r\nbeyond the equator E must diverge from the axis N and could not by any\r\nknown possibility cause the star P to be visible to an observer at C.\r\nNo matter how distant the star P, the line C D being divergent from\r\nthe direction N P could never come in contact with it. The fact, then,\r\nthat the polar star has often been seen from many degrees beyond the\r\nequator, is really an important argument against the doctrine of the\r\nEarth’s rotundity.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that because a pendulum vibrates more rapidly in\r\nthe northern region than at the equator, the Earth is thereby proved to\r\nbe a globe; and because the variation in the velocity is not exactly as\r\nit should be if all the surface of the Earth were equidistant from the\r\ncentre, it has been concluded that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, or\r\nthat its diameter is rather less through the poles than it is through\r\nthe equator. The difference was calculated by Newton to be the 235th\r\npart of the whole diameter; or that the polar was to the equatorial\r\ndiameter as 689 to 692. Huygens gave the proportion as 577 to 875 or\r\na difference of about one-third of the whole diameter. Others have\r\ngiven still different proportions; but recently the difference of\r\nopinion has become so great that many have concluded that the Earth\r\nis really instead of oblate an _oblong_ spheroid. It is certain that\r\nthe question when attempted to be answered by measuring arcs of the\r\nmeridian, is less satisfactory than was expected. This will be evident\r\nfrom the following quotation from the account of the ordnance survey\r\nof Great Britain, which was conducted by the Duke of Richmond, Col.\r\nMudge, General Roy, Mr. Dalby, and others, who measured base lines on\r\nHounslow Heath and Salisbury Plain with glass rods and steel chains:\r\n“when these were connected by a chain of triangles and the length\r\ncomputed the result did not differ more than one inch from the actual\r\nmeasurements--a convincing proof of the accuracy with which all the\r\noperations had been conducted.\r\n\r\nThe two stations, of Beachy Head in Sussex and Dunnose in the Isle of\r\nWight, are visible from each other, and more than 64 miles asunder,\r\nnearly in a direction from east to west; their exact distance was found\r\nby the geodetical operations to be 339,397 feet (64 miles and 1477\r\nfeet). The azimuth, or bearing of the line between them with respect\r\nto the meridian, and also the latitude of Beachy Head, were determined\r\nby astronomical observations. From these data the length of a degree\r\nperpendicular to the meridian was computed; and this, compared with the\r\nlength of a meridional degree in the same latitude, gave the proportion\r\nof the polar to the equatorial axis. The result thus obtained, however,\r\ndiffered considerably from that obtained by meridional degrees. It\r\nhas been found impossible to explain the want of agreement in a\r\nsatisfactory way. * * By comparing the celestial with the terrestrial\r\narcs, the length of degrees in various parallels was determined as in\r\nthe following table:--\r\n\r\n                                 Latitude of\r\n                                middle point.

But a more recent measurement\r\nmade by the Swedish Astronomers in Bothnia shows the French to have\r\nbeen incorrect, having given the degree there 196 toises more than\r\nthe true length. Other observations have been made, but as no two sets\r\nof experiments agree in result, it would be very unsatisfactory to\r\nconclude from them that the Earth is an oblate spheroid.\r\n\r\nReturning to the pendulum, it will be found to be equally\r\nunsatisfactory as a proof of this peculiar rotundity of the Earth. It\r\nis argued that as the length of a seconds pendulum at the equator is\r\n39,027 inches, and 39,197 inches at the north pole, that the Earth\r\nmust be a globe, having a less diameter through its axis than through\r\nits equator. But this proceeds upon the _assumption_ that the Earth\r\n_is_ a globe having a “centre of attraction of gravitation,” towards\r\nwhich all bodies gravitate or fall; and as the pendulum is a falling\r\nbody under certain restraint, the fact that it oscillates or falls\r\nmore rapidly at the north than it does at the equator, is a proof that\r\nthe north is nearer to the centre of attraction, or the centre of\r\nthe Earth, than is the equatorial region; and, of course, if nearer,\r\nthe radius must be shorter; and therefore the “Earth is a spheroid\r\nflattened at the poles.” This is very ingenious and very plausible,\r\nbut, unfortunately for its character as an argument, the essential\r\nevidence is wanting that the Earth is a globe at all! whether oblate\r\nor oblong, or truly spherical, are questions logically misplaced.\r\nIt should also be first proved that _no other_ cause could operate\r\nbesides greater proximity to the centre of gravity, to produce the\r\nvariable oscillations of a pendulum. This not being attempted, the\r\nwhole subject must be condemned as logically insufficient, irregular,\r\nand worthless for its intended purpose. Many philosophers have ascribed\r\nthe alterations in the oscillations of a pendulum to the diminished\r\ntemperature of the northern centre. That the heat gradually and almost\r\nuniformly diminishes on passing from the equator to the north is well\r\nascertained. “The mean annual temperature of the whole Earth at the\r\nlevel of the sea is 50° Fah.

That the condition\r\nof the air must have some influence in this respect will be seen\r\nfrom the following extract from experiments on pendulums by Dr.\r\nDerham, recorded in numbers 294 and 480 of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_:--“The arches of vibration _in vacuo_ were larger than\r\nin the open air, or in the receiver before it was exhausted; the\r\nenlargement or diminution of the arches of vibration were _constantly\r\nproportional_ to the _quantity of air_, or rarity, or density of it,\r\nwhich was left in the receiver of the air-pump. And as the _vibrations_\r\nwere _longer_ or _shorter_, _so_ the _times_ were accordingly, viz.,\r\ntwo seconds in an hour when the vibrations were longest, and less and\r\nless as the air was re-admitted, and the vibrations shortened.”\r\n\r\nThus there are two distinct and tangible causes which necessarily\r\noperate to produce the variable oscillations of a pendulum, without\r\nsupposing any distortion in the supposed rotundity of the Earth. First,\r\nif the pendulum vibrates in the air, which is colder and therefore\r\ndenser in the north than at the equator, it must be more or less\r\nresisted in its passage through it; and, secondly, if it vibrates _in\r\nvacuo_, the temperature being less, the length must be less, the arcs\r\nof vibration less, and the velocity greater. In going towards the\r\nequator, the temperature increases, the length becomes greater, the\r\narcs increase, and the times of vibration diminish.\r\n\r\nAnother argument for the globular form of the Earth is the\r\nfollowing:--The degrees of longitude radiating from the north pole\r\ngradually increase in extent as they approach the equator; beyond which\r\nthey again converge towards the south. To this it is replied that no\r\nactual measurement of a degree of longitude has ever been made south of\r\nthe equator! If it be said that mariners have sailed round the world\r\nin the southern region and have _computed_ the length of the degrees,\r\nit is again replied that such evidence is unfavourable to the doctrine\r\nof rotundity. It will be seen from the following table of what the\r\ndegrees of longitude would be if the earth were a globe of 25,000\r\nmiles circumference, and comparing these with the results of practical\r\nnavigation, that the diminution of degrees of longitude beyond the\r\nequator is purely imaginary.\r\n\r\nLatitudes at different longitudes:--\r\n\r\n  Latitude  1 = 59·99 nautical miles.\r\n           10 = 59·09    „       „\r\n           20 = 56·38    „       „\r\n           30 = 51·96    „       „\r\n           34 = 49·74 (Cape Town)\r\n           40 = 45·96    „       „\r\n           45 = 42·45 (Port Jackson, Sydney)\r\n           50 = 38·57    „       „\r\n           56 = 33·55 (Cape Horn)\r\n           60 = 30·00    „       „\r\n           65 = 25·36    „       „\r\n           70 = 20·52    „       „\r\n           75 = 15·53    „       „\r\n           80 = 10·42    „       „\r\n           85 =  5·53    „       „\r\n           86 =  4·19    „       „\r\n           87 =  3·14    „       „\r\n           88 =  2·09    „       „\r\n           89 =  1·05    „       „\r\n           90 =  0·00    „       „\r\n\r\nAccording to the above table (which is copied from a large Mercator’s\r\nchart in the library of the Mechanics’ Institute, Royal Hill,\r\nGreenwich), the distance round the Earth at the Antarctic circle would\r\nonly be about 9,000 miles. But practical navigators give the distance\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to Port Jackson as 8,000 miles; from Port\r\nJackson to Cape Horn as 8,000 miles; and from Cape Horn to the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, 6,000 miles, making together 22,000 miles. The average\r\nlongitude of these places is 45°, at which parallel the circuit of\r\nthe Earth, if it be a globe, should only be 14,282 miles. Here, then,\r\nis an error between the theory of rotundity and practical sailing of\r\n7,718 miles. But there are several statements made by Sir James Clarke\r\nRoss which tend to make the disparity even greater: at page 236, vol.\r\n2, of “South Sea Voyages,” it is said “From near Cape Horn to Port\r\nPhilip (in Melbourne, Australia) the distance is 9,000 miles.” These\r\ntwo places are 143 degrees of longitude from each other. Therefore\r\nthe whole extent of the Earth’s circumference is a mere arithmetical\r\nquestion. If 143 degrees make 9,000 miles, what will be the distance\r\nmade by the whole 360 degrees into which the surface is divided? The\r\nanswer is, 22,657 miles; or, 8,357 miles more than the theory of\r\nrotundity would permit. It must be borne in mind, however, that the\r\nabove distances are nautical measure, which, reduced to statute miles,\r\ngives the actual distance round the Southern region at a given latitude\r\nas 26,433 statute miles; or nearly 1,500 miles more than the largest\r\ncircumference ever assigned to the Earth at the equator.\r\n\r\nBut actual measurement of a degree of longitude in Australia or some\r\nother land far south of the equator can alone place this matter beyond\r\ndispute. The problem to be solved might be given as the following:--A\r\ndegree of longitude in England at the latitude of 50° N. is 38·57\r\nnautical or 45 statute miles; at the latitude of Port Jackson in\r\nAustralia, which is 45° S., a degree of longitude, if the Earth is a\r\nglobe, should be 42·45 nautical or 49·52 statute miles. But if the\r\nEarth is a plane, and the distances above referred to as given by\r\nnautical men are correct, a degree of longitude on the parallel of Port\r\nJackson will be 69·44 statute miles, being a difference of 19·92 or\r\nnearly 20 statute miles. In other words, a degree of longitude along\r\nthe southern part of Australia ought to be, _if the Earth is a plane_,\r\nnearly 20 miles greater than a degree of longitude on the southern\r\ncoast of England. This is the point which has yet to be settled. The\r\nday is surely not far distant when the scientific world will demand\r\nthat the question be decided by proper geodetical operations! And\r\nthis not altogether for the sake of determining the true figure of\r\nthe Earth, but also for the purpose of ascertaining, if possible, the\r\ncause of the many anomalies observed in navigating the southern region.\r\nThese anomalies have led to the loss of many vessels and the sacrifice\r\nof a fearful amount of life and property. “In the southern hemisphere,\r\nnavigators to India have often fancied themselves east of the Cape when\r\nstill West, and have been driven ashore on the African coast, which\r\naccording to their reckoning lay behind them. This misfortune happened\r\nto a fine frigate, the “Challenger,” in 1845.”[7] “Assuredly there are\r\nmany shipwrecks from alleged errors in reckoning which _may_ arise\r\nfrom a somewhat false idea of the general form and measurement of the\r\nEarth’s surface. Such a subject, therefore, ought to be candidly and\r\nboldly discussed.”[8]\r\n\r\n  [7] “Tour through Creation,” by the Rev. Thomas Milner, M.A.\r\n\r\n  [8] “The Builder,” Sept. 20, 1862, in a “review” of a\r\n  recently-published work on Astronomy.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that surveyors when laying out railways\r\nand canals, are obliged to allow 8 inches per mile for the Earth’s\r\ncurvature; and that if this were not done in the latter case the water\r\nwould not be stationary, but would flow on until at the end of one\r\nmile in each direction, although the canal should have the same depth\r\nthroughout, the surface would stand 8 inches higher in the middle than\r\nat the ends. In other words, that the bottom of a canal in which the\r\nallowance of 8 inches per mile had not been made, would be a chord\r\nto the surface of the contained water, which would be an arc of a\r\ncircle. To this it is replied, that both in regard to railways and\r\ncanals, wherever an allowance has been attempted the work has not\r\nbeen satisfactory; and so irregular were the results in the earlier\r\ndays of railway, canal, and other surveying, that, the most eminent\r\nengineers abandoned the practice of the old “forward levelling” and\r\nallowing for convexity; and adopted what is now called the “double\r\nsight” or “back-and-fore sight” method. It was considered that whether\r\nthe surface were convex or horizontal, or whether the convexity were\r\nmore or less than the supposed degree, would be of no consequence in\r\npractice if the spirit level or theodolite were employed to read both\r\nbackwards and forwards; for whatever degree of convexity existed,\r\none “sight” would compensate for the other; and if the surface were\r\nhorizontal, the same mode of levelling would apply. So important did\r\nthe ordnance department of the Government consider this matter, that it\r\nwas deemed necessary to make the abandonment of all ideas of rotundity\r\ncompulsory, and in a standing order (No. 6) of the House of Lords as to\r\nthe preparation of sections for railways, &c., the following language\r\nis used, “That the section be drawn to the same _horizontal_ scale as\r\nthe plan; and to a vertical scale of not less than one inch to every\r\none hundred feet; and shall show the surface of the ground marked on\r\nthe plan, the intended level of the proposed work, the height of every\r\nembankment, and the depth of every cutting; and a _datum_ HORIZONTAL\r\nLINE, which shall be _the same throughout the whole length of the\r\nwork_, or any branch thereof respectively; and shall be referred to\r\nsome fixed point stated in writing on the section, near some portion of\r\nsuch work; and in the case of a canal, cut, navigation, turnpike, or\r\nother carriage road, or railway, near either of the termini.” No. 44\r\nof the standing orders of the House of Commons is similar to the above\r\norder (No. 6) of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThus it is evident that the doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity cannot\r\nbe mixed up with the practical operations of civil engineers and\r\nsurveyors, and to prevent the waste of time and the destruction of\r\nproperty which necessarily followed the doings of some who were\r\ndetermined to involve the convexity of the Earth’s surface in their\r\ncalculations, the very Government of the country has been obliged to\r\ninterfere! Every survey of this and other countries, whether ordnance\r\nor otherwise, is now carried out in connection with a horizontal datum,\r\nand therefore, as no other method proves satisfactory, it is virtually\r\nan admission by all the most practical scientific men of the day that\r\nthe Earth _cannot be other than a plane_!\r\n\r\nAn argument for the Earth’s convexity is thought by many to be found\r\nin the following facts:--“Fluid or semi-fluid substances in a state\r\nof motion invariably assume the globular form, as rain, hail, dew,\r\nmercury, and melted lead, which, poured from a great height becomes\r\ndivided into spherical masses, as in the manufacture of small shot,\r\n&c.” “There is abundant evidence from geology that the Earth has been\r\na fluid or semi-fluid mass, and it could not, therefore, continue in\r\na state of motion through space without becoming spherical.” Without\r\ndenying that the Earth has been, at some former period, in a pulpy or\r\nsemi-fluid state, it is requisite to prove beyond all doubt that it\r\nhas a motion upon axes and through space, or the conclusion that it\r\nis therefore spherical is premature and illogical. It will be shown\r\nin a subsequent part of this work, that such axial and orbital motion\r\ndoes not exist, and therefore any argument founded upon and including\r\nit as a fact is necessarily fallacious. In addition to this, it may\r\nbe remarked that the tendency in falling fluids to become globular is\r\nowing to what has been called “attraction of cohesion” (not “attraction\r\nof gravitation”), which is very limited in its operation. It is\r\nconfined to small quantities of matter. If, in the manufacture of\r\nsmall shot, the melted metal is allowed to fall in masses of several\r\nounces or pounds, instead of being divided into particles weighing\r\nonly a few grains, it will never take a spherical form, and shot of\r\nan inch in diameter could not be made by this process. Bullets of\r\neven half-an-inch diameter can only be made by casting the metal into\r\nspherical moulds. In tropical countries, the rain instead of falling in\r\ndrops or small globules, often comes down in large irregular masses,\r\nwhich have no approximation whatever to sphericity. So that it is\r\nmanifestly unjust to affirm of large masses of matter like the Earth\r\nthat which only belongs to minute portions or a few grains in weight.\r\nThe whole matter taken together entirely fails as an argument for the\r\nEarth’s rotundity.\r\n\r\nThose who hold that the Earth is a globe will often affirm, with\r\nvisible enthusiasm, that in an eclipse of the Moon there is proof\r\npositive of rotundity. That the shadow of the Earth upon the Moon is\r\nalways round; and that nothing but a globe could, in all positions,\r\ncast a circular shadow. Here again the essential requirements of an\r\nargument are wanting. It is _not proved_ that the Moon is eclipsed _by\r\na shadow_. It is _not proved_ that the _Earth moves_ in an orbit, and\r\ntherefore takes _different positions_. It is _not proved_ that the Moon\r\nreceives her light from the Sun, and that therefore her surface is\r\ndarkened by the Earth intercepting the Sun’s light. It will be shown\r\nin the proper place that the Earth has no motion in space or on axes;\r\nthat it is not a shadow which eclipses the Moon; that the Moon is not\r\na reflector of the Sun’s light, but is _self-luminous_; and therefore\r\ncould not possibly be obscured by _a shadow_ from any object whatever.\r\nThe subject is only introduced here because it forms one of the\r\ncategory of supposed evidences of the Earth’s rotundity. But to call\r\nthat an argument where every necessary proposition is assumed, is to\r\nstultify both the judgment and the reasoning powers!\r\n\r\nMany place great reliance upon what is called the “spherical excess”\r\nobserved in levelling, as a proof of the Earth’s rotundity. In\r\nCastle’s Treatise on Levelling it is stated that “the angles taken\r\nbetween any three points on the surface of the Earth by the theodolite,\r\nare, strictly speaking, spherical angles, and their sum must exceed 180\r\ndegrees; and the lines bounding them are not the chords as they should\r\nbe, but the tangents to the Earth. This excess is inappreciable in\r\ncommon cases, but in the larger triangles it becomes necessary to allow\r\nfor it, and to diminish each of the angles of the observed triangle by\r\none-third of the spherical excess. To calculate this excess, divide the\r\narea of the triangle in feet by the radius of the Earth in seconds and\r\nthe quotient is the excess.”\r\n\r\nThe following observation as made by surveyors, also bears upon the\r\nsubject:--If a spirit-level or theodolite be “levelled,” and a given\r\npoint be read upon a graduated staff at the distance of about or\r\nmore than 100 chains, this point will have an altitude slightly in\r\nexcess of the altitude of the cross-hair of the theodolite; and if the\r\ntheodolite be removed to the position of the graduated staff and again\r\nlevelled, and a backward sight taken to the distance of 100 chains,\r\nanother excess of altitude will be observed; and this excess will\r\ngo on increasing as often as the experiment or backward and forward\r\nobservation is repeated. From this it is argued that the line of sight\r\nfrom the spirit-level or theodolite is a tangent, and that the surface\r\nof the Earth is therefore spherical.\r\n\r\nOf a similar character is the following observation:--If a theodolite\r\nor spirit-level be placed upon the sea-shore, and “levelled,” and\r\ndirected towards the sea, the line of the horizon will be observed to\r\nbe a given amount below the cross-hair of the instrument, to which a\r\ncertain dip, or inclination from the level will have to be given to\r\nbring the cross-hair and the sea horizon together. It is concluded that\r\nas the sea horizon is always observed to be below the cross-hair of the\r\n“levelled” theodolite, the line of sight is a tangent, the surface of\r\nthe water convex, and therefore the Earth is a globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion derived from the last three observations is exceedingly\r\nplausible, and would completely satisfy the minds of scientific men\r\nas to the Earth’s sphericity if a perfect explanation could not be\r\ngiven. The whole matter has been specially and carefully examined;\r\nand one very simple experiment will show that the effects observed do\r\nnot arise from rotundity in the Earth’s surface, but from a certain\r\npeculiarity in the instruments employed. Take a convex lens or a\r\nmagnifying glass and hold it over a straight line drawn across a\r\nsheet of paper. If the glass be so held that a part of the straight\r\nline can be seen _through_ it, and another part seen _outside_ it, a\r\ndifference in the _direction_ of the line will be observed, as shown\r\nin the diagram Figure 21. Let A B C represent a straight line. If a\r\nlens is now held an inch, or more, according to its focal length,\r\nover the part of the line A B, and the slightest amount out of its\r\ncentre, that part of the line A B which passes under the lens will\r\nbe seen in the direction of the figures 1.2; but if the lens be now\r\nmoved a little out of its central position in the opposite direction,\r\nthe line B C will be observed at 3.4, or below B C. A lens is a\r\nmagnifying glass because it _dilates_ or spreads out from its centre\r\nthe objects observed through it Therefore whatever is magnified by it\r\nis seen a little out of its axis or centre. This is again necessitated\r\nby the fact that the axis or actual centre is always occupied by the\r\ncross-hair. Thus the line-of-sight in the theodolite or spirit-level\r\nnot being axial or absolutely central, reads upon a graduated staff\r\na position which is necessarily slightly divergent from the axis of\r\nvision; and this is the source of that “spherical excess” which has so\r\nlong been considered by surveyors as an important proof of the Earth’s\r\nrotundity. In this instance, as, indeed, in all the others given as\r\nevidence that the Earth is a globe, the premises do not fully warrant\r\nthe conclusion--which is premature,--drawn before the whole subject is\r\nfairly examined; and when other causes are amply sufficient to explain\r\nthe effects observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 2.\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH NO AXIAL OR ORBITAL MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a ball be allowed to drop from the mast-head of a ship _at rest_, it\r\nwill strike the deck at the foot of the mast. If the same experiment\r\nbe tried with a ship _in motion_, the same result will be observed.\r\nBecause, in the latter case, the ball is acted upon simultaneously by\r\ntwo forces at right angles to each other--one, the momentum given to it\r\nby the moving ship in the direction of its own motion, and the other\r\nthe force of gravity, the direction of which is square to that of the\r\nmomentum. The ball being acted upon by the two forces together will not\r\ngo in the direction of either, but will take a diagonal course, as\r\nshown in the following diagram, Figure 22.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe ball passing from A to C by the force of gravity, and having at\r\nthe moment of its liberation received a momentum from the ship in the\r\ndirection A B, will by the conjoint action of the two forces, take the\r\ndirection A D, falling at D, just as it would have fallen at C had the\r\nvessel remained at rest. In this way, it is contended by those who\r\nhold that the Earth is a moving sphere, a ball allowed to fall from\r\nthe mouth of a deep mine reaches the bottom in an apparently vertical\r\ndirection, the same as it would if the Earth were motionless. So far,\r\nthere need be no discussion--the explanation is granted. But now let\r\nthe experiment be modified in the following way:--Let the ball be\r\nthrown _upwards from_ the mast-head of a moving vessel; it will partake\r\nas before of two motions, the upward and the horizontal, and will take\r\na diagonal course upwards and with the vessel until the two forces\r\nexpend themselves, when it will begin to fall by the force of gravity\r\nonly, and drop into the water far behind the ship, which is still\r\nmoving horizontally. Diagram Figure 23 will illustrate this effect. The\r\nball being thrown upwards in the direction A C, and the vessel moving\r\nfrom A to B, will cause it to pass in the direction A D, arriving at D\r\nwhen the vessel reaches B; the two forces having expended themselves\r\nwhen the ball arrives at D, it will begin to descend by the force of\r\ngravity in the direction D B H, but during its fall the vessel will\r\nhave reached the position S, so that the ball will drop far behind\r\nit at the point H. To bring the ball from D to S _two forces_ would\r\nbe required, as D H and D W; but as D W does not exist, the force of\r\ngravity operates _alone_, and the ball necessarily falls behind the\r\nvessel at a distance proportionate to the altitude attained at D, and\r\nthe time occupied in falling from D to H.\r\n\r\nThe same result will be observed on throwing a ball directly upwards\r\nfrom a railway carriage when in rapid motion, as shown in the following\r\nFigure 24. While the carriage or tender passes from A to B, the ball\r\nthrown from A to C will reach the position D, but while the ball then\r\ncomes down by the force of gravity, _operating alone_, to the point H,\r\nthe carriage will have advanced to W, so that the ball will always drop\r\nmore or less behind the carriage, according to the force first given\r\nto it in the direction A C and the time occupied in ascending to D,\r\nand thence descending to H. It is therefore demanded that if the Earth\r\nhad a motion upon axes from west to east, and a ball, instead of being\r\ndropped down a mine or allowed to fall from the mast head of a ship,\r\nbe _shot upwards_ into the air; from the moment of its beginning to\r\ndescend the surface of the Earth would turn from under its direction,\r\nand it would fall behind or to the west of its line of descent. On\r\nmaking the experiment _no such effect is observed_, and therefore the\r\nconclusion is unavoidable, that the Earth DOES NOT MOVE UPON AXES!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nThe following experiment has been tried, with the object of obtaining\r\ndefinite results. If the Earth is a globe, having a circumference of\r\n25,000 miles at the equator, the circumference at the latitude of\r\nLondon (51°) will be about 16,000 statute miles; so that the motion of\r\nthe Earth’s surface, if 25,000 miles in 24 hours at the equator, in\r\nEngland would be more than 700 feet per second. An air-gun was firmly\r\nfixed to a strong post, as shown at A in Figure 25, and carefully\r\nadjusted by a plumb-line, so that it was perfectly vertical. On\r\ndischarging the gun, the ball ascended in the direction A C, and\r\ninvariably (during several trials) descended within a few inches of\r\nthe gun at A; twice it fell back upon the very mouth of the barrel.\r\nThe average time that the ball was in the atmosphere was 16 seconds;\r\nand, as half the time would be required for the ascent and half for the\r\ndescent, it is evident that if the Earth had a motion once round its\r\naxis in 24 hours, the ball would have passed in 8 seconds to the point\r\nD, while the air-gun would have reached the position B H. The ball\r\nthen commencing its descent, requiring also 8 seconds, would in that\r\ntime have fallen to the point H, while the Earth and the gun would\r\nhave advanced as far as W. The time occupied being 8 seconds, and the\r\nEarth’s velocity being 700 feet per second, the progress of the Earth\r\nand the air-gun to W, in advance of the ball at H, would be 5,600 feet!\r\nIn other words, in these experiments, the ball, which always fell back\r\nto the place of its detachment, should have fallen 5,600 feet, or\r\nconsiderably more than one statute mile to the west of the air-gun!\r\nProving beyond all doubt that the supposed axial motion of the Earth\r\nDOES NOT EXIST!\r\n\r\nThe same experiment ought to suffice as evidence against the\r\nassumed motion of the Earth in an orbit; for it is difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to understand how the behaviour of the ball thrown\r\nfrom a vertical air-gun should be other in relation to the Earth’s\r\nforward motion in space than it is in regard to its motion upon axes.\r\nBesides, if it is proved _not_ to move upon axes, the assumption\r\nthat it moves in an orbit round the Sun is useless for theoretical\r\npurposes, and there is no necessity for either denying or in any\r\nway giving it farther consideration. But that no point may be taken\r\nwithout direct evidence, let the following experiment be tried:--Take\r\ntwo carefully-bored iron tubes, about two yards in length, and place\r\nthem, one yard asunder, on the opposite sides of a wooden frame, or\r\na solid block of wood or masonry; so adjust them that their axes of\r\nvision shall be perfectly parallel to each other, and direct them to\r\nthe plane of some notable fixed star, a few seconds previous to its\r\nmeridian time. Let an observer be stationed at each tube; and the\r\nmoment the star appears in the first tube, let a knock or other signal\r\nbe given, to be repeated by the observer at the second tube when he\r\nfirst sees the star. A distinct period of time will elapse between the\r\nsignals given, showing that the same star is not visible at the same\r\nmoment by two lines of sight parallel to each other and only one yard\r\nasunder. A slight inclination of the second tube towards the first\r\nwould be required for the star to be seen at the same moment. If now\r\nthe tubes be left in their position for six months, the same star will\r\nbe visible at the same meridian time, without the slightest alteration\r\nbeing required in the direction of the tubes. From which result it\r\nis concluded that if the Earth had moved _a single yard_ in an orbit\r\nthrough space there would at least be the difference of time indicated\r\nby the signals, and the slight inclination of the tube which the\r\ndifference in position of one yard required. But as no such difference\r\nin the direction of the tube is required, the conclusion is unavoidable\r\nthat in six months a given meridian upon the Earth has not moved a\r\nsingle yard, and that therefore the Earth has not the slightest degree\r\nof orbital motion--or motion at right angles to the meridian of a given\r\nstar! It will be useless to say in explanation that the stars are so\r\ninfinitely distant that a difference in the angle of inclination of the\r\ntube in six months could not be expected, as it will be proved in a\r\nsubsequent section that _all_ the stars are within a few thousand miles\r\nfrom the Earth’s surface!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 3.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE DISTANCE OF THE SUN AND STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it is now demonstrated that the Earth is a plane, the distance of\r\nthe Sun and Stars may readily be measured by plane trigonometry. The\r\nbase line in any operation being horizontal and always a carefully\r\nmeasured one, the process becomes exceedingly simple. Let the altitude\r\nof the Sun be taken on a given day at 12 o’clock at the high-water\r\nmark on the sea shore at Brighton, in Sussex; and at the same hour\r\nat the high-water mark of the River Thames, near London Bridge; the\r\ndifference in the Sun’s altitude taken simultaneously from two stations\r\nupon the same meridian, and the distance between the stations, or the\r\nlength of the base line ascertained, are all the elements required for\r\ncalculating the exact distance of the Sun from London or Brighton;\r\nbut as this distance is the hypothenuse of a triangle, whose base is\r\nthe Earth’s surface, and vertical side the zenith distance of the\r\nSun, it follows that the distance of the Sun from that part of Earth\r\nto which it is vertical is less than the distance from London. In the\r\nDiagram, Figure 26, let L B represent the base line from London to\r\nBrighton, a distance of 51 statute miles. The altitude at L and at B\r\ntaken at the same moment of time will give the distance L S or B S.\r\nThe angle of altitude at L or B, with the length of L S or B S, will\r\nthen give the vertical distance of the Sun S from E, or the place which\r\nis immediately underneath it. This distance will be thus found to be\r\nconsiderably less than 4,000 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe following are the particulars of an observation made, a few years\r\nago, by the officers engaged in the Ordnance survey. Altitude of the\r\nSun at London 55° 13′; altitude taken at the same time, on the grounds\r\nof a public school, at Ackworth, in Yorkshire, 53° 2′; the distance\r\nbetween the two places in a direct line, as measured by triangulation,\r\nis 151 statute miles. From these elements the true distance of the Sun\r\nmay be readily computed; and proved to be under 4,000 miles!\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, an officer of the Royal Engineers, in the\r\nhead-quarters of the Ordnance Survey, at Southampton, has furnished the\r\nfollowing elements of observations recently made:--\r\n\r\n  Southern Station, Sun’s altitude, 45°\r\n  Northern  ditto,   „       „      38°\r\n  Distance between the two stations, 800 statute miles.\r\n\r\nThe calculation made from these elements gives the same result, viz.,\r\nthat the actual distance of the Sun from the Earth is less than 4,000\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe same method of measuring distances applies equally to the Stars;\r\nand it is easy to demonstrate, beyond the possibility of doubt, so long\r\nas assumed premises are excluded, that all the visible objects in the\r\nfirmament are contained within the distance of 6,000 miles!\r\n\r\nFrom these demonstrable distances it follows unavoidably that the\r\n_magnitude_ of the Sun, Moon, Stars, &c., is very small--much smaller\r\nthan the Earth from which they are measured; and to which therefore\r\nthey cannot possibly be other than secondary, and subservient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 4.\r\n\r\nTHE SUN MOVES IN A CIRCLE OVER THE EARTH, CONCENTRIC WITH THE NORTH\r\nPOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Earth has been shown to be fixed, the motion of the Sun is a\r\nvisible reality; and if it be observed from any northern latitude, and\r\nfor any period before and after the time of southing, or passing the\r\nmeridian, it will be seen to describe an arc of a circle; an object\r\nmoving in an arc cannot return to the centre of such arc without having\r\ncompleted a circle. This the Sun does visibly and daily. To place the\r\nmatter beyond doubt, the observation of the Arctic navigators may be\r\nreferred to. Captain Parry, and several of his officers, on ascending\r\nhigh land in the vicinity of the north pole, repeatedly saw, for 24\r\nhours together, the sun describing a circle upon the southern horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 5.\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMETER OF THE SUN’S PATH IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING--DIMINISHING FROM\r\nDECEMBER 21ST TO JUNE 15TH, AND ENLARGING FROM JUNE TO DECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of absolute certainty, proved by what is called, in\r\ntechnical language, the northern and southern declination, which is\r\nsimply saying that the Sun’s path is nearest the north pole in summer,\r\nand farthest away from it in winter. This difference in position gives\r\nrise to the difference of altitude, as observed at various periods of\r\nthe year, and which is shewn in the following table, given in “The\r\nIllustrated London Almanack,” for 1848, by Mr. Glaisher, of the Royal\r\nObservatory, Greenwich.\r\n\r\n“Sun’s altitude at the time of Southing, or being on the meridian:--\r\n\r\n                            Sun’s    Time of Southing.\r\n                          altitude.

The light of the Sun gradually\r\ndiminishing from S, to the Arctic circle 1 2 3, where it becomes\r\ntwilight, does so according to the well-known law of radiation, equally\r\nin all directions--hence, the circle 4 5 6 represents the whole extent\r\nof the Sun’s light at any given time. The arc 4 E is the advancing or\r\nmorning twilight, and 6 E the receding or evening twilight; to every\r\nplace underneath a line drawn across the circle through S to N it is\r\nnoonday. It will now be easily understood that as the Sun S moves in\r\nthe direction of the arrows or from right to left, and completes the\r\ncircle A A A in 24 hours, it will produce in that period morning,\r\nnoon, evening, and night to all parts of the Earth in succession. On\r\nreferring to the diagram, it will be seen that to England, E, the\r\nlength of the day at this time of the year is the _shortest_, the\r\namount of light being represented by the arc E E E; and also that\r\nthe northern centre N remains in darkness during the whole daily\r\nrevolution of the Sun, the light of which terminates at the Arctic\r\ncircle 1 2 3. Thus, morning, noon, evening, midnight, the _shortest_\r\ndays, or the Winter season, and the constant or six months’ darkness\r\nat the pole are all a part of one general phenomenon. As the Sun’s\r\npath begins now to diminish every day until in six months, or on the\r\n15th of June, it describes the circle B B B, it is evident that the\r\nsame extent of sunlight will reach over or beyond the pole N, as shown\r\nin the following diagram (Fig. 28), when morning, noon, evening, and\r\nnight will again occur as before; but the amount of light passing over\r\nEngland, represented by the arc E E E, is now much larger than when\r\nthe Sun was upon the circle A A A, and represents the _longest_ days,\r\nor the _Summer_ season, and the constant, or six months’ light at the\r\npole. Thus, day and night, long and short days, Winter and Summer, the\r\nlong periods of alternate light and darkness at the pole, arise simply\r\nfrom the Sun’s position in relation to the north pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nIf the Earth is a globe, it is evident that Winter and Summer, and\r\nlong and short days, will be of the same character and duration in\r\ncorresponding latitudes, in the southern as in the northern hemisphere.\r\nBut we find that in many respects there is a marked difference; for\r\ninstance, in New Zealand, where the latitude is about the same as in\r\nEngland, a remarkable difference exists in the length of day and night.\r\nIn the Cook’s Strait Almanack, for 1848, it is stated, “At Wellington,\r\nNew Zealand, December 21, Sun rises 4h. 31m., and sets at 7h. 29m., the\r\nday being 14 hours 58 minutes. June 21st, Sun rises at 7h. 29m., and\r\nsets at 4h. 31m., the day being 9 hours and 2 minutes. In England the\r\nlongest day is 16h. 34m., and the shortest day is 7h. 45m. Thus the\r\n_longest day_ in New Zealand is 1 hour and 36 minutes _shorter_ than\r\nthe _longest day_ in England; and the _shortest day_ in New Zealand is\r\n1 hour and 17 minutes _longer_ than the shortest day in England.”\r\n\r\nIn a recently published pamphlet, by W. Swainson, Esq., Attorney\r\nGeneral, the following passage occurs:--“Compared with an English\r\nsummer, that of Auckland is but little warmer, though much longer; but\r\nthe nights in New Zealand are always cool and refreshing.... The days\r\nare _one hour shorter_ in the summer, and _one hour longer_ in the\r\nwinter than in England! of _twilight_ there is _little_ or _none_.”\r\n\r\nFrom a work, also recently published, on New Zealand, by Arthur S.\r\nThompson, M.D., the following sentences are quoted:--“The summer\r\nmornings, even in the warmest parts of the colony are sufficiently\r\nfresh to exhilarate without chilling; and the seasons glide\r\nimperceptibly into each other. The days are _an hour shorter_ at\r\n_each end_ of the day in summer, and an hour longer in winter than in\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\nA letter from a correspondent in New Zealand, dated Nelson, September\r\n15, 1857, contains the subjoined passages:--“Even in summer people\r\nhere have no notion of going without fires in the evening; but then,\r\nthough the days are very warm and sunny, the nights are always cold.\r\nFor seven months last summer we had not one day that the Sun did\r\nnot shine as brilliantly as it does in England in the finest day in\r\nJune; and though it has more power here, the heat is not nearly so\r\noppressive.... But then there is not the twilight which you get in\r\nEngland. Here it is light till about eight o’clock; then, in a few\r\nminutes, it becomes too dark to see anything, and the change comes\r\nover in almost no time.” “Twilight lasts but a short time in so low\r\na latitude as 28 degrees, and no sooner does the Sun peep above the\r\nhorizon, than all the gorgeous parade by which he is preceded is shaken\r\noff, and he comes in upon us in the most abrupt and unceremonious way\r\nimaginable.”[9] These various peculiarities could not exist in the\r\nsouthern region if the Earth were spherical and moved upon axes, and\r\nin an orbit round the Sun. If the Sun is fixed, and the Earth revolves\r\nunderneath it, the same phenomena should exist at the same distance on\r\neach side of the Equator. But such is not the case! What can operate\r\nto cause the twilight in New Zealand to be so much more sudden than it\r\nis in England? The southern “hemisphere” cannot revolve more rapidly\r\nthan the northern! The distance round _a globe_ would be the same at\r\n50° south as at 50° north, and as the whole globe would revolve once in\r\n24 hours, the surface at the two places would move underneath the Sun\r\nwith the same velocity, and the light would approach in the morning\r\nand recede in the evening in exactly the same manner; yet the _very\r\ncontrary_ is the fact! The twilight in England in summer is slow and\r\ngradual, but in New Zealand it is rapid and abrupt; a difference which\r\nis altogether incompatible with the doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity.\r\nBut, the Earth a plane, and it is a simple “matter of course.” Let E,\r\nin Figure 28, represent England, and W New Zealand; the radius N E and\r\nthe consequent circle round N is much less than the radius N W and\r\nits consequent circle round the same point. But as the larger circle,\r\nradius N W is passed over by the sunlight in the same time (24 hours)\r\nas the smaller circle, radius N E, the velocity is proportionately\r\ngreater. The velocity is the space passed over multiplied by the time\r\nin passing, and as the space over New Zealand is much greater than the\r\nspace over England, the velocity of the Sun-light must be much greater,\r\nand its morning and evening twilight necessarily more “abrupt and\r\nunceremonious;” and _therefore_, it might be said with strictly logical\r\naccuracy, the Earth is a Plane, and cannot possibly be a Globe!\r\n\r\n  [9] Captain Basil Hall, R.N., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 7.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF “SUNRISE” AND “SUNSET.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Sun is at all times above and parallel to the Earth’s\r\nsurface, he appears to ascend the firmament from morning until noon,\r\nand to descend and sink below the horizon at evening. This arises from\r\na simple and everywhere visible law of perspective. A flock of birds,\r\nwhen passing over a flat or marshy country, always appears to descend\r\nas it recedes; and if the flock is extensive, the first bird appears\r\nlower, or nearer to the horizon than the last. When a balloon sails\r\nfrom an observer without increasing or decreasing its altitude, it\r\nappears gradually to approach the horizon. The farthest light in a row\r\nof lamps appears the lowest, although each one has the same altitude.\r\nBearing these phenomena in mind, it will easily be seen how the Sun,\r\nalthough always parallel to the surface of the Earth, must appear to\r\nascend when approaching, and descend after leaving the meridian or\r\nnoon-day position. Let the line A B, Fig. 29, represent a portion\r\nof the Earth’s surface; C D of the Sun’s path, and H H, the line of\r\nsight. The surface of the Earth, A B, will appear to ascend from B to\r\nH, forming the horizon. When the Sun is traversing the line C D, in the\r\ndirection of the arrows, he will appear to emerge from the horizon H,\r\nand to gradually ascend the line H D. When in the position 1, he will\r\n_appear_ to be at the point 2; and when at 3, the apparent position\r\nwill be at 4; but when he arrives upon the meridian D, his apparent\r\nand actual, or noon-day position, will be the same. But now, from the\r\npoint D, the Sun will appear to descend, as in Fig. 30, and when he\r\nhas passed from D to 1, he will appear at 2, and when really at 3 will\r\nappear at 4; and thus continuing his course in the direction D C, he\r\nwill reach the horizon at H, and disappear or “set” to the observer\r\nat H A. Thus “Sunrise” and “Sunset” are phenomena dependent entirely\r\nupon the fact that horizontal lines parallel to each other appear to\r\napproach or converge in the distance, the surface of the Earth being\r\nhorizontal, and the line-of-sight of the observer and the Sun’s path\r\nbeing parallel with it, necessarily produce the observed phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 8.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF SUN APPEARING LARGER WHEN RISING AND SETTING THAN WHEN ON THE\r\nMERIDIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that when a light of any kind shines through a\r\ndense medium it will appear larger than when seen through a lighter\r\nmedium. This will be more remarkable when the medium holds aqueous\r\nparticles in solution,--as in a damp or foggy atmosphere the light of\r\na gas-lamp will seem greater at a given distance than it will under\r\nordinary circumstances. In the diagram, Figure 30, it is evident that\r\nH D is less than H 1, H 3, or H 5. The latter (H 5) represents the\r\ngreater amount of atmosphere which the Sun has to shine through when\r\napproaching the horizon; and as the air near the Earth is both more\r\ndense and more damp, or holds more watery particles in solution, the\r\nlight of the Sun must be dilated or enlarged as well as modified in\r\ncolour. But the enlarged appearance of the Sun when rising and setting\r\nis only an optical impression, as proved by actual measurement. “If\r\nthe angle of the Sun or Moon be taken either with a tube or micrometer\r\nwhen they appear so large to the eye in the horizon, the measure is\r\nidentical when they are in the meridian and appear to the eye and\r\nmind but half the size. The apparent distance of the horizon is three\r\nor four times greater than the zenith. Hence the mental mistake of\r\nhorizontal size, for the angular dimensions are equal; the first 5° is\r\napparently to the eye equal to 10° or 15° at 50° or 60° of elevation;\r\nand the first 15° fill a space to the eye equal to a third of the\r\nquadrant. This is evidently owing to the ‘habit of sight,’ for with an\r\naccurate instrument the measure of 5° near the horizon is equal to 5°\r\nin the zenith.”[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] “Million of Facts,” by Sir Richard Philips, p. 537.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 9.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF SOLAR AND LUNAR ECLIPSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Eclipse of the Sun is caused simply by the Moon passing before it,\r\nor between it and the observer on the Earth. Of this no question has\r\nbeen raised. But that an Eclipse of the Moon arises from a shadow\r\nof the Earth is in every respect unsatisfactory. The Earth has been\r\nproved to have no motion, either upon axes or in an orbit round the\r\nSun, and therefore it could never come between the Sun and the Moon.\r\nThe Earth is proved to be a Plane, always underneath the Sun and Moon,\r\nand therefore to speak of its intercepting the light of the Sun and\r\nthus casting its own shadow upon the Moon, is to say that which is\r\nimpossible. Besides this, cases are on record of the Sun and Eclipsed\r\nMoon being above the horizon together. “The full Moon has sometimes\r\nbeen seen above the horizon before the Sun was set. A remarkable\r\ninstance of this kind was observed at Paris on the 19th of July, 1750,\r\nwhen the Moon appeared visibly Eclipsed while the Sun was distinctly\r\nto be seen above the horizon.”[11] “On the 20th of April, 1837, the\r\nMoon appeared to rise Eclipsed before the Sun had set. The same\r\nphenomenon was observed on the 20th of September, 1717.”[12] “In the\r\nlunar Eclipses of July 17, 1590; Nov. 3, 1648; June 16, 1666; and May\r\n26, 1668, the Moon rose Eclipsed whilst the Sun was still apparently\r\nabove the horizon. Those _horizontal_ Eclipses were noticed as early\r\nas the time of Pliny.”[13] The Moon’s entire surface, or that portion\r\npresented to the Earth has also been distinctly seen during the whole\r\ntime of a total Eclipse, a phenomenon utterly incompatible with the\r\ndoctrine that the Earth’s shadow is the cause of it. “The Moon has\r\nsometimes shown during a total Eclispe with an almost unaccountable\r\ndistinctness. On Dec. 22, 1703, the Moon, when totally immersed in\r\nthe Earth’s shadow, was visible at Avignon by a ruddy light of such\r\nbrilliancy that one might have imagined her body to be transparent, and\r\nto be enlightened from behind; and on March 19th, 1848, it is stated\r\nthat so bright was the Moon’s surface during its total immersion, that\r\nmany persons could not be persuaded that it was eclipsed. Mr. Forster,\r\nof Bruges, states, in an account of that eclipse, that the light and\r\ndark places on the moon’s surface could be almost as well made out as\r\nin an ordinary dull moonlight night.\r\n\r\n  [11] “Astronomy and Astronomical Instruments,” p. 105, by Geo. G.\r\n  Carey.\r\n\r\n  [12] “McCulloch’s Geography,” p. 85.\r\n\r\n  [13] “Illustrated London Almanack for 1864,” the astronomical part in\r\n  which is by James Glaisher, Esq., of the Greenwich Observatory.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, in a total lunar eclipse, the moon will appear quite\r\nobscure in some parts of its surface, and in other parts will exhibit\r\na high degree of illumination. * * * To a certain extent I witnessed\r\nsome of these phenomena during the merely partial eclipse of February\r\n7th, 1860. * * * I prepared, during the afternoon of February 6th for\r\nwitnessing the eclipse, without any distinct expectation of seeing much\r\nworthy of note. I knew, however, that upwards of eight-tenths of the\r\ndisc would be covered, and I was anxious to observe with what degree\r\nof distinctness the eclipsed portion could be viewed, partly as an\r\ninteresting fact, and partly with a view of verifying or discovering\r\nthe weak points of an engraving (in which I am concerned) of a lunar\r\neclipse.\r\n\r\n“After seeing the increasing darkness of the penumbra softly merging\r\ninto the true shadow at the commencement of the eclipse (about 1\r\no’clock a.m., Greenwich time) I proceeded with pencil and paper,\r\ndimly lighted by a distant lamp, to note by name the different lunar\r\nmountains and plains (the so-called seas) over which the shadow\r\npassed. * * * During the first hour and ten minutes I had seen nothing\r\nunexpected. * * * I had repeatedly written down my observations of\r\nthe remarkable clearness with which the moon’s eclipsed outline could\r\nbe seen, both with the naked eye, and with the telescope; at 1 hour\r\n58 minutes, however, I suddenly noted the ruddy colour of a _portion_\r\nof the moon. I may as well give my notes in the original words, as\r\ncopied next day in a more connected form:--1h. 58m., Greenwich time. I\r\nam suddenly struck by the fact that the whole of the western seas of\r\nthe moon are showing through the shadow with singular sharpness, and\r\nthat the whole region where they lie has assumed a decidedly reddish\r\ntinge, attaining its greatest brightness at a sort of temporary polar\r\nregion, having ‘Endymion’ about the position of its imaginary pole. I\r\nparticularly notice that the ‘Lake of Sleep’ has disappeared in this\r\nbrightness, instead of standing out in a darker shade: and I notice\r\nthat this so-called polar region is not parallel with the rim of the\r\nshadow, but rather west of it.--2h. 15m. Some clouds, though very thin\r\nand transparent, now intervene.--2h. 20m. The sky is now cleared, How\r\nextraordinary is the appearance of the Moon _Reddish_ is not the word\r\nto express it; it is red--red hot! I endeavour to think of various\r\nred objects with which to compare it, and nothing seems so like as a\r\n_red-hot penny_--a red-hot penny with a little _white_-hot piece at its\r\nlower edge, standing out against a dark-blue back ground; only it is\r\nevidently not a mere disc, but beautifully rounded by shading.\r\n\r\n“Such is its appearance with the naked eye: with the telescope its\r\nsurface varies more in tint than with the naked eye, and is not of\r\nquite so bright a red as when thus viewed. The redness continues to be\r\nmost perceptible at a distance from the shadow’s southern edge, and to\r\nbe greatest about the region of ‘Endymion.’ The Hercynian mountains\r\n(north of Grimaldus) are, however, of rather a bright red, and\r\nGrimaldus shows well. Mare Crisium and the western seas are wonderfully\r\ndistinct. Not a trace to be seen of Aristarchus or Plato.--2h. 27m.\r\nIt is now nearly the middle of the eclipse. The red colour is very\r\nbrilliant to the naked eye. * * * After this, I noticed a progressive\r\nchange of tint in the Moon.--2h. 50m. The Moon does not seem to the\r\nnaked eye of so bright a red as before; and again I am reminded by its\r\ntint of red-hot copper, or rather copper which has begun to cool. The\r\nwhole of Grimaldi is now uncovered. Through the telescope I notice a\r\ndecided grey shade at the lower part of the eclipsed portion, and the\r\nvarious small craters give it a stippled effect, like the old aqua-tint\r\nengravings. The upper part is reddish, but two graceful bluish curves,\r\nlike horns, mark the form of the Hercynian mountains, and the bright\r\nregion on the other limb of the Moon. These are visible also to the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\n“At 3h. 5m. the redness had almost disappeared; a very few minutes\r\nafterwards, no trace of it remained, and ere long clouds came on.\r\nI watched the Moon, however, occasionally gaining a glimpse of its\r\ndisc, till a quarter to four o’clock, when, for the last time on that\r\noccasion, I saw it faintly appearing through the clouds, nearly a full\r\nMoon again; and then I took leave of it, feeling amply repaid for my\r\nvigil by the beautiful spectacle which I had seen.”[14]\r\n\r\n  [14] The Hon. Mrs. Ward, Trimleston House, near Dublin, in\r\n  “Recreative Science,” p. 281.\r\n\r\nMr Walkey, who observed the lunar eclipse of March 19th, 1848, near\r\nCollumpton, says--“The appearances were as usual till 20 minutes\r\npast 9; at that period, and for the space of the next hour, instead\r\nof an eclipse, or the shadow (umbra) of the Earth being the cause\r\nof the total obscurity of the Moon, the whole phase of that body\r\nbecame very quickly and most beautifully _illuminated_; and assumed\r\nthe appearance of the glowing heat of fire from the furnace, rather\r\ntinged with a _deep red_. * * * The whole disc of the Moon being as\r\n_perfect with light_ as if there had been _no eclipse whatever_! * *\r\n* The Moon positively gave _good light from its disc during the total\r\neclipse_!”[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] “Philosophical Magazine,” No. 220, for August, 1848.\r\n\r\nIn the astronomical portion of the “Illustrated London Almanack\r\nfor 1864,” by Mr. Glaisher, a beautiful tinted engraving is given\r\nrepresenting the appearance of the Moon during the total eclipse\r\nof June 1, 1863, when all the light and dark places--the so-called\r\nmountains, seas, &c., were plainly visible. In the accompanying\r\ndescriptive chapter, the following sentences occur:--“At the time\r\nof totality the Moon presented a soft woolly appearance, apparently\r\nmore globular in form than when fully illuminated. Traces of the\r\nlarger and brighter mountains were visible at the time of totality,\r\nand particularly the bright rays proceeding from Tycho, Kepler, and\r\nAristarchus. * * * At first, when the obscured part was of small\r\ndimensions, it was of an iron grey tint, but as it approached totality,\r\nthe reddish light became so apparent that it was remarked that the\r\nMoon ‘seemed to be on fire;’ and when the totality had commenced, it\r\ncertainly looked like a fire smouldering in its ashes, and almost\r\ngoing out.”\r\n\r\nIf then, the Sun and Moon have many times been seen above the horizon\r\nwhen the latter was eclipsed, how can it be said that the Earth’s\r\nshadow was the cause of a lunar eclipse, when the Earth was not between\r\nor in a line with the Sun and Moon? And how can the Moon’s non-luminous\r\nsurface be distinctly visible and illuminated during the very totality\r\nof an eclipse, if all the light of the Sun is intercepted by the Earth?\r\n\r\nAgain, if the Moon is a sphere, which it is declared to be, how can its\r\nsurface _reflect_ the light of the Sun? If her surface was a mass of\r\npolished silver, it could not reflect from more than a mere point! Let\r\na silvered glass ball or globe of considerable size be held before a\r\nlamp or fire of any magnitude, and it will be seen that instead of the\r\nwhole surface reflecting light, there will be a very small portion only\r\nilluminated. But the Moon’s _whole surface_ is brilliantly illuminated!\r\na condition or effect utterly impossible if it be spherical. The\r\nsurface _might_ be _illuminated_ from the Sun, or any other source if\r\nopaque, instead of polished, like an ordinary silvered mirror, but it\r\ncould not shine intensely from every part, and brightly illuminate the\r\nobjects before it, as the Moon does so beautifully when full and in\r\na clear firmament. If the Earth _were admitted_ to be globular, and\r\nto move, and to be capable of throwing a shadow by intercepting the\r\nlight of the Sun, it would be impossible for a lunar eclipse to occur\r\nthereby, unless at the same time the Moon be proved to be non-luminous,\r\nand to shine only by reflection. But this is not proved; it is only\r\nassumed as an essential part of a theory. The _contrary_ is capable\r\nof proof, and proof beyond the power of doubt, viz., that the Moon\r\nis _self-luminous_, or shines with a light peculiar to herself, and\r\ntherefore independently of the Sun. A reflector necessarily gives\r\noff what it receives. If a mass of red-hot metal be placed before a\r\nplane or concave surface, _heat_ will be reflected. If snow or ice\r\nbe similarly placed, _cold_ will be reflected. If light, ordinary or\r\ncoloured, be presented, the _same_ will be reflected. If sound of a\r\ngiven pitch be produced, the same pitch will be reflected. If the\r\nnote A be sounded upon a musical instrument, a reflector would not\r\nreturn the note B or C, but the _same note_, altered only in degree or\r\nintensity, but not in “pitch.” A reflector receiving a red light would\r\nnot return a blue or yellow light. A reflector collecting the cold from\r\na mass of ice, would not throw off heat; nor the contrary. Nor could\r\nthe Moon, if a reflector, radiate or throw down upon the Earth any\r\nother light than such as she receives from the Sun. No difference could\r\nexist in the quality or character of the light, and it could differ in\r\nno respect but the quantity or intensity.\r\n\r\nThe light of the Sun and of the Moon are different in their general\r\nappearance--in the colour and action upon the eye.\r\n\r\nThe Sun’s light is drying and preservative, or antiseptic. The Moon’s\r\nlight is damp and putrefactive.\r\n\r\nThe Sun’s rays will put out a common fire; the Moon’s light will\r\nincrease the combustion. The light of the Sun falling upon certain\r\nchemical substances, produces a change of colour, as in photographic\r\nand other processes. The light of the Moon fails to produce the same\r\neffect. Dr. Lardner, at page 121 of his excellent work, “The Museum of\r\nScience,” says--“The most striking instance of the effect of certain\r\nrays of solar light in blackening a light-colored substance, is\r\nafforded by chloride of silver, which is a white substance, but which\r\nimmediately becomes black when acted upon by the rays near the violet\r\nextremity of the spectrum. This substance, however, highly susceptible\r\nas it is of having its colour affected by light, is, nevertheless,\r\nfound not to be changed in any sensible degree when exposed to the\r\nlight of the Moon, even when that light is condensed by the most\r\npowerful burning lenses.”\r\n\r\nThe Sun’s light when concentrated by a number of mirrors, or a large\r\nburning lens, produces a focus which is entirely non-luminous, but\r\nin which the heat is so great that metallic and alkaline substances\r\nare quickly fused; earthy and mineral compounds almost immediately\r\nvitrified; and all animal and vegetable structures in a few seconds\r\nburned up and destroyed. But the Moon’s light so concentrated produces\r\na brilliant focus, so luminous that it is difficult to look upon it;\r\nand yet there is no increase of temperature! “If the most delicate\r\nthermometer be exposed to the full light of the Moon, shining with its\r\ngreatest lustre, the mercury is not elevated a hair’s breadth, neither\r\nwould it be if exposed in the focus of her rays concentrated by the\r\nmost powerful lenses. This has been proved by actual experiment.”[16]\r\n“This question has been submitted to the test of direct experiment. * *\r\n* The bulb of a thermometer sufficiently sensitive to render apparent a\r\nchange of temperature amounting to the thousandth part of a degree, was\r\nplaced in the focus of a concave reflector of vast dimensions, which,\r\nbeing directed to the Moon, the lunar rays were collected with great\r\npower upon it. Not the slightest change, however, was produced in the\r\nthermometric column, proving that a concentration of rays sufficient to\r\nfuse gold, if they proceeded _from the Sun_, does not produce a change\r\nof temperature so great as the thousandth part of a degree, when they\r\nproceed _from the Moon_.”[17]\r\n\r\n  [16] “All the Year Round,” by Dickens.\r\n\r\n  [17] Dr. Lardner’s Museum of Science, p. 115.\r\n\r\n“The light of the Moon though concentrated by the most powerful burning\r\nglass, is incapable of raising the temperature of the most delicate\r\nthermometer. M. De La Hire collected the rays of the full Moon when\r\non the meridian, by means of a burning glass thirty-five inches in\r\ndiameter, and made them fall on the bulb of a delicate air-thermometer.\r\n_No effect was produced_, though the lunar rays by this glass were\r\nconcentrated 300 times.” “Professor Forbes concentrated the Moon’s\r\nlight by a lens thirty inches in diameter, its focal distance being\r\nabout forty-one inches, and having a power of concentration exceeding\r\n6,000 times. The image of the Moon which was only eighteen hours past\r\nfull, and less than two hours from the meridian, was brilliantly thrown\r\nby this lens on the extremity of a commodious thermo-pile. Although the\r\nobservations were made in the most unexceptional manner, and (supposing\r\nthat half the rays were reflected, dispersed, and absorbed) though the\r\nlight of the Moon was concentrated _3000 times, not the slightest\r\nthermo-effect was produced_![18] In the “Lancet” (medical journal) for\r\nMarch 14th, 1856, particulars are given of several experiments, which\r\nproved that the Moon’s rays when concentrated actually _reduced_ the\r\ntemperature upon a thermometer more than 8 degrees!\r\n\r\n  [18] Dr. Noad’s Lectures on Chemistry, p. 334.\r\n\r\n    “The cold chaste Moon, the Queen\r\n    Of Heaven’s bright Isles;\r\n    Who makes all beautiful\r\n    On which she smiles:\r\n    That wandering shrine of soft\r\n    Yet _icy flame_,\r\n    Which ever is transformed\r\n    Yet still the same;\r\n    And _warms not_ but _illumes_.”\r\n\r\n  --SHELLEY.\r\n\r\nThe “pale _cold_ Moon” is an expression not only beautiful poetically\r\nbut evidently true philosophically.\r\n\r\nIf, as we have now seen, the very nature of a reflector demands certain\r\nconditions and the Moon does not manifest these conditions, it must\r\nof necessity be concluded that the Moon is _not_ a _reflector_, but\r\na _self-luminous body_. If self-luminous her surface could not be\r\ndarkened or eclipsed by a shadow of the Earth--supposing such were\r\nthrown upon it. The luminosity instead of being diminished would be\r\ngreater in proportion to the greater density or darkness of the\r\nshadow. As the light in a lantern shines most brightly in the darkest\r\nplaces, so would the Moon’s self-luminous surface be most intense in\r\nthe deepest part of the Earth’s shadow. It is thus rendered undeniable\r\nthat a Lunar Eclipse _does_ not and _could_ not arise from a shadow of\r\nthe Earth! As a _Solar_ Eclipse occurs from the Moon passing over the\r\nSun; so from the evidence it is clear that a Lunar Eclipse _can only_\r\narise from a similar cause--a body semi-transparent and well-defined\r\npassing before the Moon, or between her surface and the observer on the\r\nsurface of the Earth. That such a body exists is admitted by several\r\ndistinguished astronomers. In the report of the Council of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society for June, 1850, it is stated, “We may well doubt\r\nwhether that body which we call the Moon is the _only satellite_ of\r\nthe Earth.” In the report of the Academy of Sciences for October 12,\r\n1846, and again for August, 1847, the Director of one of the French\r\nObservatories gives a number of observations and calculations which\r\nhave led him to conclude that “there is at least _one non-luminous\r\nbody_ of considerable magnitude which is attached as a _satellite to\r\nthis Earth_.”[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] Referred to in Lardner’s “Museum of Science,” p. 159.\r\n\r\nPersons who are unacquainted with the methods of calculating Eclipses\r\nand other astronomical phenomena, are prone to look upon the\r\ncorrectness of these calculations as powerful arguments in favour of\r\nthe doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity and the Newtonian philosophy\r\ngenerally. But this is erroneous. Whatever theory is adopted, or if\r\nall theories are discarded, the same results may follow, because the\r\nnecessary data may be tabulated and employed independently of all\r\ntheory, or may be mixed up with any, even the most opposite doctrines,\r\nor kept distinct from every system, just as the operator may decide.\r\nThe tables of the Moon’s relative positions for almost any second of\r\ntime are purely practical, the result of long continued observation,\r\nand may or may not be mixed up with hypothesis. In Smith’s “Rise and\r\nprogress of Astronomy,” speaking of Ptolemy, who lived in the 2nd\r\ncentury of the Christian Era, it is said, “The (considered) defects of\r\nhis system did not prevent him from calculating all the Eclipses that\r\nwere to happen for 600 years to come.” Professor Partington, at page\r\n370 of his Lectures on Natural Philosophy, says, “The most ancient\r\nobservations of which we are in possession, that are sufficiently\r\naccurate to be employed in astronomical calculations, are those made\r\nat Babylon about 719 before the Christian Era, of three Eclipses of\r\nthe Moon. Ptolemy, who has transmitted them to us, employed them for\r\ndetermining the period of the Moon’s mean motion; and therefore had\r\nprobably none more ancient on which he could depend. The Chaldeans,\r\nhowever, must have made a long series of observations before they could\r\ndiscover their “Saros” or lunar period of 6,585¹⁄₃ days, or about 18\r\nyears; at which time, as they had learnt, the place of the Moon, her\r\n_node_ and _apogee_ return nearly to the same situation with respect\r\nto the Earth and the Sun, and, of course, a series of nearly similar\r\nEclipses occur.”\r\n\r\nSir Richard Phillips, in his “Million of Facts,” at page 388,\r\nsays:--“The precision of astronomy arises, not from theories, but from\r\nprolonged observations, and the regularity of the motions, or the\r\nascertained uniformity of their irregularities. Ephemerides of the\r\nplanets’ places, of Eclipses, &c., have been published for above 300\r\nyears, and were nearly as precise as at present.”\r\n\r\n“No particular theory is required to calculate Eclipses; and the\r\ncalculations may be made with equal accuracy _independent of every\r\ntheory_.”[20]\r\n\r\n  [20] Somerville’s Physical Sciences, p. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 10.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF TIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity being fallacious, all ideas of\r\n“centre of attraction of gravitation,” “mutual attraction of Earth and\r\nMoon,” &c., &c., must be given up; and the cause of tides in the ocean\r\nmust be sought for in another direction. It is certain that there is\r\na constant pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface of the Earth\r\nand ocean. This is proved by ordinary barometrical observations, many\r\nPneumatic experiments, and by the fact that during the most fearful\r\nstorms at sea the surface only is disturbed; at the depth of a hundred\r\nfeet the water is always calm--except in the path of well-marked\r\ncurrents and local submarine phenomena. The following quotations\r\ngathered from casual reading fully corroborate this statement. “It is\r\namazing how superficial is the most terrible tempest. Divers assure\r\nus that in the greatest storms calm water is found at the depth of 90\r\nfeet.”[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] Chambers’s Journal, No. 100, p. 379.\r\n\r\n“This motion of the surface of the sea is not perceptible to a great\r\ndepth. In the strongest gale it is supposed not to extend beyond\r\n72 feet below the surface; and at the depth of 90 feet the sea is\r\nperfectly still.”[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] Penny Cyclopædia, Article Sea.\r\n\r\n“The people are under a great mistake who believe that the substance of\r\nthe water moves to any considerable depth in a storm at sea. It is only\r\nthe form or shadow which hurries along like a spirit, or like a thought\r\nover the countenance of the ‘great deep,’ at the rate of some forty\r\nmiles an hour. Even when the ‘Flying Dutchman’ is abroad the great mass\r\nof water continues undisturbed and nearly motionless a few feet below\r\nthe surface.”[23]\r\n\r\n  [23] London Saturday Journal, August 8, 1840, p. 71.\r\n\r\n“The unabraded appearance of the shells brought up from great depths,\r\nand the almost total absence of the mixture of any _detritus_ from the\r\nsea, or foreign matter, suggest most forcibly the idea of _perfect\r\nrepose_ at the bottom of the deep sea.”[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] Physical Geography of the Sea, by Lieut. Maury, p. 265.\r\n\r\nBearing this fact in mind, that there exists a continual pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere upon the Earth, and associating it with the fact that\r\nthe Earth is a vast plane “stretched out upon the waters,” and it will\r\nbe seen that it must of necessity slightly fluctuate, or slowly rise\r\nand fall in the water. As by the action of the atmosphere the Earth\r\nis slowly depressed, the water moves towards the receding shores and\r\nproduces the flood tide; and when by the reaction of the resisting\r\noceanic medium the Earth gradually ascends the waters recede, and the\r\nebb tide is produced. This is the _general_ cause of tides. Whatever\r\npeculiarities are observable they may be traced to the reaction of\r\nchannels, bays, headlands, and other local causes.\r\n\r\nIf a raft, or a ship, or any other structure floating upon water be\r\ncarefully observed, it will be seen to have a gentle fluctuating\r\nmotion. However calm the water and the atmosphere may be, this\r\ngradual rising and falling of the floating mass is always more or\r\nless observable. If vessels of different sizes are floating near each\r\nother they will be seen to fluctuate with different velocities, the\r\nlargest and heaviest will move the least rapidly. This motion will be\r\nobservable whether the vessels be held by their anchors, or moored to\r\nbuoys, or freely floating in still water. A large and heavily laden\r\nvessel will make several fluctuations in a minute of time; the Earth\r\nonce only in about twelve hours, because it is proportionately larger.\r\n\r\nTo this simple condition of the Earth,--the action or pressure upon\r\nit of the atmosphere, and the reaction or resistance to it of the\r\nwater, may be traced all the leading peculiarities of the tides.\r\nThe simultaneous ebb and flow upon meridians 180° apart. The absence\r\nof high and low water in large inland seas and lakes; which being\r\ncontained within and fluctuating with the Earth cannot therefore show\r\na relative change in the altitude of the surface. The flux and reflux\r\nobserved in several inland wells and basins though far from the sea,\r\nbut being connected with it by subterranean passages, necessarily show\r\na relative difference in the surface levels of the earth and water. And\r\nthe regular ebb and flood of the water in the great Polar sea recently\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Kane, although it is separated from the great tidal\r\ncurrent of the Atlantic Ocean by deep barriers of ice--as will be seen\r\nby the following quotation:--“Dr. Kane reported an open sea north of\r\nthe parallel of 82°. To reach it his party crossed a barrier of ice\r\n80 or 100 miles broad. Before gaining this open water he found the\r\nthermometer to show the extreme temperature of -60°. Passing this\r\nice-bound region by travelling North, he stood on the shores of an\r\niceless sea extending in an unbroken sheet of water as far as the eye\r\ncould reach towards the pole. Its waves were dashing on the beach with\r\nthe swell of a boundless ocean. The tides ebbed and flowed in it, and I\r\napprehend that the tidal wave from the Atlantic can no more pass under\r\nthis icy barrier to be propagated in seas beyond than the vibrations\r\nof a musical string can pass with its notes a ‘fret’ upon which the\r\nmusician has placed his finger. * * * These tides therefore must have\r\nbeen born in that cold sea, having their cradle about the North Pole;\r\nand we infer that most, if not all, the unexplored regions about the\r\nPole are covered with deep water; for, were this unexpected area mostly\r\nland, or shallow water, it could not give birth to regular tides.”[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] Physical Geography of the Sea, by Lieut. Maury, p. 176.\r\n\r\nThat the Earth has a vibratory or tremulous motion, such as must\r\nnecessarily belong to a floating and fluctuating structure, is\r\nabundantly proved by the experience of astronomers and surveyors.\r\nIf a delicate spirit-level be firmly placed upon a rock or upon the\r\nmost solid foundation which it is possible to construct, the very\r\ncurious phenomenon will be observed of constant change in the position\r\nof the air-bubble. However carefully the “level” may be adjusted,\r\nand the instrument protected from the atmosphere, the “bubble”\r\nwill not maintain its position many seconds together. A somewhat\r\nsimilar influence has been noticed in astronomical observatories,\r\nwhere instruments of the best construction and placed in the most\r\napproved positions cannot always be relied upon without occasional\r\nre-adjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 11.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION, CONDITION, AND ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH BY FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical analysis proves to us the important fact that the great\r\nbulk of the Earth--meaning thereby the _land_ as distinct from the\r\nwaters--is composed of metallic oxides or metals in combination with\r\noxygen. When means are adopted to remove the oxygen it is found that\r\nmost of these metallic bases are highly combustible. The different\r\ndegrees of affinity existing among the elements of the Earth, give rise\r\nto all the rocks, minerals, ores, deposits, and strata which constitute\r\nthe material habitable world. The different specific gravities or\r\nrelative densities which these substances are found to possess, and the\r\nnumerous evidences which exist of their former plastic or semi-fluid\r\ncondition, afford positive proof that from a once commingled or chaotic\r\nstate regular but rapid precipitation, stratification, crystallization,\r\nand concretion successively occurred; and that in some way not yet\r\nclear to us sufficient chemical action was produced to ignite a great\r\nportion of the Earth, and to reduce it to a molten incandescent state,\r\nthe volatile products of which being forcibly eliminated have broken\r\nup the stratified formations, and produced the irregular confused\r\ncondition which we now observe. That such an incandescent molten\r\nstate of a great portion of the lower parts of the Earth still exists\r\nis a matter of certainty; and there is evidence that the heat thus\r\ninternally generated is gradually increasing.\r\n\r\n“The uppermost strata of the soil share in all the variations of\r\ntemperature which depend upon the seasons; and this influence is\r\nexerted to a depth which, although it varies with the latitude, is\r\nnever very great. Beyond this point the temperature rises in proportion\r\nas we descend to greater depths, and it has been shown, by numerous\r\nand often-repeated experiments, that the increase of temperature is\r\non average one degree (Fahrenheit) for about every 545 feet. Hence it\r\nresults that at a depth of about twelve miles from the surface, we\r\nshould be on the verge of an incandescent mass.”[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] Rambles of a Naturalist, by M. de Quatrefages.\r\n\r\n“So great is the heat within the Earth, that in Switzerland, and other\r\ncountries where the springs of water are very deep, they bring to the\r\nsurface the warm mineral waters so much used for baths and medicine for\r\nthe sick; and it is said, that if you were to dig very deep down into\r\nthe Earth, the temperature would increase at the rate of one degree\r\nof the thermometer for every 100 feet; so that, at the depth of 7000\r\nfeet, or one mile and a half, all the water that you found would be\r\nboiling; and at the depth of about ten miles all the rocks would be\r\nmelted. * * * A day will yet come when this earth will be burned up by\r\nthe fire. There is fire, as you have heard, within it, ready to burst\r\nforth at any moment.”[27] “This earth, although covered all round with\r\na solid crust, is all on fire within. Its interior is supposed to be a\r\nburning mass of melted, glowing metals, fiery gas, and boiling lava.\r\n* * * * * The solid crust which covers this inward fire is supposed\r\nnot to be much more than from 9 to 12 miles in thickness. Whenever\r\nthis crust breaks open, or is cleft in any place, there rush out lava,\r\nfire, melted rocks, fiery gases, and ashes, sometimes in such floods as\r\nto bury whole cities. From time to time we read of the earth quaking,\r\ntrembling, and sometimes opening, and of mountains and small islands\r\n(which are mountains in the sea) being thrown up in a day.”[28]\r\n\r\n  [27] “The World’s Birthday,” by Professor Gaussen, Geneva, p. 43.\r\n\r\n  [28] “The World’s Birthday,” by Professor Gaussen, Geneva, p. 42.\r\n\r\nIn a periodical called “Recreative Science,” at the end of an\r\ninteresting article on volcanoes, &c., the following sentence\r\noccurs:--“The conclusion is therefore inevitable, that the general\r\ndistribution all over the earth of volcanic vents, their similarity of\r\naction and products, their enormous power and seeming inexhaustibility,\r\ntheir extensiveness of action in their respective sites, the\r\ncontinuance of their energies during countless years, and the incessant\r\nburning day and night, from year to year, of such craters as Stromboli;\r\nand lastly, the apparent inefficiency of external circumstances in\r\ncontrolling their operations, eruptions happening beneath the sea as\r\nbeneath the land, in the frigid as in the torrid zone, for these and\r\nmany less striking phenomena, we must seek for some great and general\r\ncause, such only as the central heat of the earth affords us.”\r\n\r\nSir Richard Phillips says, “at the depth of 50 feet (from the sea\r\nlevel) the temperature of the earth is the same winter and summer.”\r\n* * * “The deepest coal mine in England is at Killingworth, near\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, and the mean annual temperature at 400 yards below\r\nthe surface is 77°; and at 300 yards, 70°; while at the surface it is\r\nbut 48°, being about one degree of increase for every 15 yards. Hence,\r\nat 3,300 yards, the heat would be equal to boiling water, taking 20\r\nyards to a degree. This explains the origin of hot springs. The heat of\r\nthe Bath waters is 116°, hence they would appear to rise from a depth\r\nof 1,320 yards. By experiments made at the Observatory of Paris for\r\nascertaining the increase of temperature from the surface of the earth\r\ntowards the interior, 51 feet, or 17 yards, corresponds to the increase\r\nof one degree Fahrenheit’s thermometer. Hence, the temperature of\r\nboiling water would be at 8,212 feet, or about 1¹⁄₂ English miles under\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman, of America, states “that in boring the Artesian\r\nwells in Paris, the temperature increased at the rate of 1 degree for\r\nevery 50 feet downwards; and, reasoning from causes known to exist, the\r\nwhole of the interior part of the earth, or, at least, a great part of\r\nit, is an ocean of melted rock agitated by violent winds.”\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, in his address to the British Association, assembled\r\nat Bath, September, 1864, speaking of hot springs generally, said “An\r\nincrease of heat is always experienced as we descend into the interior\r\nof the earth. * * * The estimate deduced by Mr. Hopkins, from an\r\naccurate series of observations made in the Monkwearmouth shaft, near\r\nDurham, and in the Dukenfield shaft, near Manchester, each of them\r\n2,000 feet in depth. In these shafts the temperature was found to rise\r\nat the rate of 1° Fah. for every increase of depth of from 65 to 70\r\nfeet.”\r\n\r\n“The observations made by M. Arago, in 1821, that the deepest Artesian\r\nwells are the warmest, threw great light on the origin of thermal\r\nsprings, and on the establishment of the law, that terrestrial heat\r\nincreases with increasing depth. It is a remarkable fact, which has\r\nbut recently been noticed, that at the close of the third century St\r\nPatricius, probably Bishop of Partusa, was led to adopt very correct\r\nviews regarding the phenomenon of the hot springs at Carthage. On being\r\nasked what was the cause of boiling water bursting from the earth,\r\nhe replied, ‘Fire is nourished in the clouds, and in the interior of\r\nthe earth, as Etna and other mountains near Naples may teach you.\r\nThe subterranean waters rise as if through siphons. The cause of hot\r\nsprings is this: waters which are more remote from the subterranean\r\nfire are colder, whilst those which rise nearer the fire, are heated\r\nby it, and bring with them to the surface which we inhabit, an\r\ninsupportable degree of heat.’”[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] “Humboldt’s Cosmos,” p. 220.\r\n\r\nThe investigations which have been made, and the evidence which has\r\nbeen brought together, render it undeniable that the lower parts of the\r\nearth are on fire. Of the intensity of the combustion, no practical\r\nidea can be formed. It is fearful beyond comparison. The lava thrown\r\nout from a volcano in Mexico, “was so hot that it continued to smoke\r\nfor twenty years; and after three years and a half, a piece of wood\r\ntook fire in it, at a distance of five miles from the crater.” In\r\nvarious parts of the world, large islands have been thrown up from the\r\nsea, in a red-hot glowing condition, and so intensely heated, that\r\nafter being forced through many fathoms of salt water, and standing\r\nin the midst of it, exposed to wind and rain for several months,\r\nthey were not sufficiently cooled for persons to approach and stand\r\nupon them. “A notable fact is the force exerted in volcanic action,\r\nCotopaxi, in 1738, threw its fiery rockets 3,000 feet above its crater,\r\nwhile in 1744 the blazing mass, struggling for an outlet, roared like\r\na furnace, so that its awful voice was heard at a distance of more\r\nthan six hundred miles. In 1797, the crater of Tunguragua, one of the\r\ngreat peaks of the Andes, flung out torrents of mud, which dammed up\r\nrivers, opened new lakes, and in valleys of a thousand feet wide made\r\ndeposits six hundred feet deep. The stream from Vesuvius which, in\r\n1737, passed through Torre del Greco, contained thirty-three million\r\ncubic feet of solid matter; and, in 1794, when Torre del Greco was\r\ndestroyed a second time, the mass of lava amounted to forty-five\r\nmillion cubic feet. In 1669 Etna poured forth a flood which covered 84\r\nsquare miles of surface, and measured nearly 100,000,000 cubic feet.\r\nOn this occasion the sand and scoriæ formed the Monte Rossi, near\r\nNicolosi, a cone two miles in circumference, and four hundred and fifty\r\nfeet high. The stream thrown out by Etna, in 1819, was in motion, at\r\nthe rate of a yard per day, for nine months after the eruption; and\r\nit is on record that the lavas of the same mountain, after a terrible\r\neruption, were not thoroughly cooled and consolidated ten years after\r\nthe event. In the eruption of Vesuvius, A.D. 79, the scoriæ and ashes\r\nvomited forth far exceeded the entire bulk of the mountain; while,\r\nin 1660, Etna disgorged more than twenty times its own mass. * * *\r\nVesuvius has thrown its ashes as far as Constantinople, Syria, and\r\nEgypt; it hurled stones eight pounds in weight to Pompeii, a distance\r\nof six miles; while similar masses were tossed up 2,000 feet above\r\nits summit. Cotopaxi has projected a block one hundred cubic yards in\r\nvolume a distance of nine miles, while Sumbawa, in 1815, during the\r\nmost terrible eruption on record, sent its ashes as far as Java, a\r\ndistance of three hundred miles. * * * In viewing these evidences of\r\nenormous power, we are forcibly struck with the similarity of action\r\nwith which they have been associated; and, carrying our investigation\r\na step further, the same similarity of the producing power is hinted\r\nat in the identity of the materials ejected. Thus, if we classify\r\nthe characteristics of all recorded eruptions, we shall find that\r\nthe phenomena are all reducible to upheavals of the earth, rumblings\r\nand explosions, ejections of carbonic acid, fiery torrents of lava,\r\ncinders, and mud, with accompanying thunder and lightning. The\r\nlast-named phenomena are extrajudicial in character; they are merely\r\nthe result of the atmospheric disturbance consequent on the escape of\r\ngreat heat from the earth, just as the burning of an American forest\r\ncauses thunder and rain. The connection that apparently exists, too,\r\nbetween neighbouring craters is strongly confirmed by the fact that\r\nin every distinct volcanic locus but _one_ crater is usually active\r\nat a time. Since Vesuvius has resumed his activity, the numerous\r\nvolcanic vents on the other side of the bay have sunk into comparative\r\ninactivity; for ancient writers, who are silent respecting the former,\r\nspeak of the mephitic vapours of the Lake Avernus as destructive to\r\nanimal existence, and in earlier days than these Homer pictures the\r\nPhlegrean Fields as the entrance to the infernal regions, placed at the\r\nlimits of the habitable world, unenlightened by rising or setting sun,\r\nand enveloped in eternal gloom. * * * * The earth contains within it\r\na mass of heated material; nay, it is a heated and incandescent body,\r\nhabitable only because surrounded with a cool crust--the crust being\r\nto it a mere shell, within which the vast internal fires are securely\r\ninclosed: and yet not securely, perhaps, unless such vents existed as\r\nthose to which we apply the term volcano. * * * * Every volcano is\r\na safety-valve, ready to relieve the pressure from within when that\r\npressure rises to a certain degree of intensity; or permanently serving\r\nfor the escape of conflagrations, which, if not so provided with\r\nescape, might rend the habitable crust to pieces.”[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Recreative Science, p.p. 257 to 260.\r\n\r\nThus it is certain, from the phenomena of earthquakes, submarine and\r\ninland volcanoes which exist in every part of the earth from the frozen\r\nto the tropical regions, hot and boiling springs, fountains of mud\r\nand steam, lakes of burning sulphur, jets and blasts of destructive\r\ngases, and the choke and fire damps of our coal mines, that at a few\r\nmiles only below the surface of the earth there exists a vast region of\r\ncombustion, the intensity and power of which are indescribable, and\r\ncannot be compared with anything within the range of human experience.\r\n\r\nAs the earth is an extended plane resting in and upon the waters of\r\nthe “great deep” it may fitly be compared to a large vessel or ship\r\nfloating at anchor, with her “Hold” or lower compartments beneath the\r\nwater-line filled with burning materials; and, from our knowledge of\r\nthe nature and action of fire, it is difficult to understand in what\r\nway the combustion can be prevented from extending, when it is known\r\nto be surrounded with highly inflammable substances. Wherever a fire\r\nis surrounded with heterogeneous materials--some highly combustible\r\nand others partially and indirectly combustible--it is not possible\r\nfor it to remain continually in the same condition nor to diminish in\r\nextent and intensity, it must increase and extend itself. That the fire\r\nin the earth is so surrounded with inflammable materials is matter of\r\ncertainty; the millions of tons of coals, peat, turf, mineral oils,\r\nrock tar, pitch, asphalte, bitumen, petroleum, mineral naphtha, and\r\nnumerous other hydro-carbons which exist in various parts of the earth,\r\nand much of these far down below the surface, prove this condition\r\nto exist. The products of volcanic action being chiefly carbon in\r\ncombination with hydrogen and oxygen, prove also that these carbon\r\ncompounds already exist in a state of combustion, and that as such\r\nimmense quantities of the same fuel still exist, it is quite within\r\nthe range of possibility that some of the lower strata of combustible\r\nmatter may take fire and the action rapidly extend itself through\r\nthe various and innumerable veins which ramify in every direction\r\nthroughout the whole earth. Should such an action commence, knowing,\r\nas we do, that the rocks and minerals of the earth are but oxides of\r\ninflammable bases, and that the affinities of these bases are greatly\r\nweakened and almost suspended in the presence of highly heated carbon,\r\nwe see clearly that such chemical action or fire would quickly extend\r\nand increase in intensity until the whole earth with everything\r\nentering into its composition, would rapidly decompose, volatilise, and\r\nburst into one vast indescribable, annihilating conflagration!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 12.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOON’S PHASES.--It has been shown that the Moon is not a reflector of\r\nthe Sun’s light, but is self-luminous. That the luminosity is confined\r\nto one-half its surface is sufficiently shown by the fact that at “New\r\nMoon” the whole circle or outline of the Moon is often distinctly\r\nvisible; but the darker outline is less, or the circle is smaller than\r\nthe segment which is illuminated. From this it is easily seen that\r\n“New Moon,” “Full Moon,” and “Gibbous Moon” are but the different\r\nproportions of the illuminated surface which are presented to the\r\nobserver on earth.\r\n\r\nMOON’S APPEARANCE.--Astronomers have indulged their imagination to\r\nsuch a degree that the Moon has been considered to be a solid, opaque,\r\nspherical world, having mountains, valleys, lakes, volcanic craters,\r\nand other conditions analogous to the surface of the earth. So far has\r\nthis fancy been carried, that the whole visible disc has been mapped\r\nout, and special names given to its various peculiarities, as though\r\nthey had been carefully observed and measured by a party of terrestrial\r\nordnance surveyors. All this has been done in direct opposition to the\r\nfact that whoever looks, without previous bias, through a powerful\r\ntelescope at the Moon’s surface, will be puzzled to say what it is\r\nreally like, or how to compare it with anything known. The comparison\r\nwhich may be made, will depend greatly upon the state of mind of the\r\nobserver. It is well known that persons looking at the rough bark of\r\na tree, or at the irregular lines or veins in certain kinds of marble\r\nand stone, or gazing at the red embers in a dull fire, will, according\r\nto the degree of activity of the imagination, be able to see different\r\nforms, even the outlines of animals and human faces. It is in this way\r\nthat persons may fancy that the Moon’s surface is broken up into hills\r\nand valleys and other arrangements such as are found on earth. But that\r\nanything really similar to the surface of our own world is anywhere\r\nvisible upon the Moon is altogether fallacious. This is admitted by\r\nsome of those who have written upon the subject “Some persons when\r\nthey look into a telescope for the first time, having heard that\r\nmountains are to be seen, and discovering nothing but these (previously\r\ndescribed) unmeaning figures, break off in disappointment, and have\r\ntheir faith in these things rather diminished than increased. I would\r\nadvise, therefore, before the student takes even his _first view_ of\r\nthe Moon through a telescope, to form as clear an idea as he can how\r\nmountains, and valleys, and caverns situated at such a distance _ought_\r\nto look, and by what marks they may be recognised. Let him seize, if\r\npossible, the most favourable periods (about the time of the first\r\nquarter), and previously _learn from drawings_ and explanations how to\r\n_interpret_ everything he sees.”[31] “Whenever we exhibit celestial\r\nobjects to inexperienced observers it is usual to precede the view with\r\ngood _drawings_ of the objects, accompanied by an explanation of what\r\neach appearance exhibited in the telescope _indicates_. The novice is\r\ntold that mountains and valleys can be seen in the Moon by the aid\r\nof the telescope; but on looking he sees a confused mass of light\r\nand shade, and _nothing_ which _looks_ to him _like either mountains\r\nor valleys_! Had his attention been previously directed to a plain\r\n_drawing_ of the Moon, and each particular appearance _interpreted_ to\r\nhim, he would then have looked through the telescope with intelligence\r\nand satisfaction!”[32] Thus it is admitted by those who teach that the\r\nMoon is a spherical world, having hills and dales like the earth, can\r\nonly see such things in imagination. “Nothing but unmeaning figures”\r\nare really visible, and “the students break off in disappointment, and\r\nhave their faith in such things rather diminished than increased,”\r\n“until they previously learn from _drawings_ and explanations how to\r\n_interpret_ everything seen.” But who _first made_ the drawings? Who\r\n_first interpreted_ the “unmeaning figures” and the “confused mass\r\nof light and shade?” Who first declared them to indicate mountains\r\nand valleys, and ventured to make drawings and give explanations and\r\ninterpretations for the purpose of biasing the minds, and fixing or\r\nguiding the imaginations of subsequent observers? Whoever they were,\r\nthey at least had “given the reins to Fancy,” and afterwards took\r\nupon themselves to dogmatise and teach their crude and unwarranted\r\nimaginings to succeeding investigators. And this is the kind of\r\nevidence and “reasoning” which is obtruded in our seats of learning,\r\nand spread out in the numerous works which are published for the\r\nedification of society!\r\n\r\n  [31] “Mechanism of the Heavens,” by Denison Olmsted, LL.D., Professor\r\n  of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy in Gale College, U.S.\r\n\r\n  [32] Mitchell’s “Orbs of Heaven,” p. 232.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET NEPTUNE.--For some years the advocates of the earth’s\r\nrotundity, and of the Newtonian philosophy generally, were accustomed\r\nto refer with an air of pride and triumph to the discovery of a\r\nnew planet, which was called Neptune, as an undeniable evidence of\r\nthe truth of their system or theory. The existence of this luminary\r\nwas said to have been predicated from calculation only, and for a\r\nconsiderable period before it had been seen by the telescope. It\r\nwas urged that therefore the system which would permit of such a\r\ndiscovery must be true. But the whole matter subsequently proved to\r\nbe unsatisfactory. That a proper conception may be formed of the\r\nactual value of the calculations and their supposed verification,\r\nthe following account will be useful. “In the year 1781, on March\r\n13, Uranus was discovered by Sir William Herschel, who was examining\r\nsome small stars near the feet of Gemini; and he observed one of them\r\nto have a sensible amount of diameter and less brightness than the\r\nothers, and it was soon found to be a planet. It, however, had been\r\nseen before--first, by Flamstead, on December 23rd, 1690; and between\r\nthis time and 1781 it had been observed 16 times by Flamstead, Bradley,\r\nMayer, and Lemonnier; these astronomers had classed it as a star of the\r\nsixth magnitude. Between 1781 and 1820 it was of course very frequently\r\nobserved; and it was hoped that at the latter time sufficient data\r\nexisted to construct accurate tables of its motions. This task was\r\nundertaken by M. Bouvard, Member _de L’Academie des Sciences_, but he\r\nmet with unforeseen difficulties. It was found utterly impossible to\r\nconstruct tables which would represent the 17 ancient observations,\r\nand at the same time the more numerous modern ones; and it was finally\r\nconcluded that the ancient observations were erroneous, or that some\r\nstrange and unknown action disturbed, or had disturbed, the planet;\r\nconsequently M. Bouvard discarded entirely the old observations, and\r\nused only those taken between 1781 and 1820, in constructing the tables\r\nof Uranus. For some years past it has been found that the tables thus\r\nconstructed do not agree any better with modern observations, than they\r\ndo with the ancient observations; _consequently it was evident that\r\nthe planet was under the influence of some unknown cause_. Several\r\nhypotheses have been suggested as to the nature of this cause; some\r\npersons talked of a resisting medium; others of a great satellite which\r\nmight accompany Uranus; some even went so far as to suppose that the\r\nvast distance Uranus is from the Sun caused the law of gravitation to\r\nlose some of its force; others thought that the rapid flight of a comet\r\nhad disturbed its regular movements; others thought of the existence of\r\na planet beyond Uranus, whose disturbing force caused the anomalous\r\nmotions of the planet; but no one did otherwise than follow the bent\r\nof his inclination, and did not support his assertion by any positive\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n“Thus was the theory of Uranus surrounded with difficulties, when M.\r\nLe Verrier, an eminent French mathematician, undertook to investigate\r\nthe irregularities in its motions. His first paper appeared on the\r\n10th November, 1845, and his second on June 1, 1846 (published in\r\nthe Comptes Rendûs). In this second paper, after a most elaborate\r\nand careful investigation, he proves the utter incompatibility of\r\nany of the preceding hypotheses to account for the planet’s motions,\r\nexcept only that of the last one, viz., that of a new planet. He then\r\nsuccessively proves that this planet cannot be situated either between\r\nthe Sun and Saturn, or between Saturn and Uranus; but that it must be\r\nbeyond Uranus. And in this paper he asks the following questions:--‘Is\r\nit possible that the irregularities of Uranus can be owing to the\r\naction of a planet situated in the ecliptic, at a distance of twice\r\nthe mean distance of Uranus from the Sun? If so, where is it actually\r\nsituated? What is its mass? What are the elements of the orbit it\r\ndescribes?”\r\n\r\nThis was the problem he set himself to work upon, by the means of\r\nsolving the inverse problem of the perturbations; for instead of\r\nhaving to measure the action of a determined planet, he had to deduce\r\nthe elements of the orbit of the disturbing planet, and its place\r\nin the heavens from the recognised inequalities of Uranus. And this\r\nproblem M. Le Verrier has successfully solved. In his second paper\r\nhe deduces the place in the heavens that the body must be as 325° of\r\nhelio-centric longitude. On the 31st August last he published his third\r\npaper. In this he has calculated that the period of the planet is 217\r\nyears; and that it moves in an orbit at the distance of more than 3,000\r\nmillions of miles from the Sun; that its mean longitude on January\r\n1st, 1847, will be 318° 17′; its true longitude 326° 32′; and that the\r\nlongitude of its perihelion will be 284° 45′; that it will appear to\r\nhave a diameter of 3¹⁄₄ seconds of arc as seen from the earth; and that\r\nit is now about 5° E. of _Delta Capricorni_.\r\n\r\n“These remarkable calculations have pointed out a position which has\r\nvery nearly proved to be the true one.\r\n\r\n“On September 23, Dr. Galle at Berlin discovered a star of the eighth\r\nmagnitude, which has proved to be the planet. Its place at the time was\r\nfive degrees from _Delta Capricorni_. It was found to have a disc of 3\r\nseconds as predicted; and its longitude at the time differs less than a\r\ndegree from the longitude computed from the above elements. Its daily\r\nmotion, too, is found to agree very closely with the predicted; and,\r\njudging from this last circumstance, the planet’s distance, as stated\r\nabove, must be nearly the truth.\r\n\r\n“Thus the result of these calculations was the discovery of a new\r\nplanet in the place assigned to it by theory, whose mass, distance,\r\nposition in the heavens, and orbit it describes round the Sun, were all\r\napproximately determined before the planet had ever been seen; and all\r\nagrees with observations, so far as can at present be determined. It is\r\nfound to have a disc, and its diameter cannot be much less than 40,000\r\nmiles, and may be more; its motions are very slow; it is at present in\r\nthe constellation of Aquarius as indicated by theory; and it will be in\r\nthe constellation of Capricornus all the year 1847. It may be readily\r\nseen in a telescope of moderate power.\r\n\r\n“Whatever view we take of this noble discovery it is most gratifying,\r\nwhether at the addition of another planet to our list; whether at the\r\nproving the correctness of the theory of universal gravitation; or in\r\nwhat view soever, it must be considered as a splendid discovery, and\r\nthe merit is chiefly due to theoretical astronomy. This discovery is\r\nperhaps the greatest triumph of astronomical science that has ever\r\nbeen recorded.”[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] “Illustrated London Almanack for 1847.”\r\n\r\nIf such things as criticism, experience, and comparative observation\r\ndid not exist, the tone of exultation in which the above article\r\nindulges might be properly shared in by the astronomical student; but\r\nlet the following extracts be carefully read, and it will be seen that\r\nsuch a tone was premature and unwarranted. “Paris, Sept. 15, 1848.\r\nThe only sittings of the Academy of late in which there was anything\r\nworth recording, and even this was not of a practical character, were\r\nthose of the 29th ult. and the 11th inst. On the former day M. Babinet\r\nmade a communication respecting the planet Neptune, which has been\r\ngenerally called M. Le Verrier’s planet, the discovery of it having,\r\nas it was said, been made by him from theoretical deductions, which\r\nastonished and delighted the scientific public. What M. Le Verrier had\r\ninferred from the action on other planets of some body which ought to\r\nexist was verified, at least so it was thought at the time, by actual\r\nvision. Neptune was actually seen by other astronomers, and the honour\r\nof the theorist obtained additional luster. But it appears from a\r\ncommunication of M. Babinet that _this is not the planet_ of M. Le\r\nVerrier. He had placed his planet at a distance from the Sun equal to\r\nthirty-six times the limit of the terrestrial orbit; Neptune revolves\r\nat a distance equal to thirty times of these limits, which makes a\r\ndifference of nearly _two hundred millions of leagues_! M. Le Verrier\r\nhad assigned to his planet a body equal to thirty-eight times that of\r\nthe earth; Neptune has only _one third_ of this volume! M. Le Verrier\r\nhad stated the revolutions of his planet round the Sun to take place\r\nin two hundred and seventeen years; Neptune performs its revolutions\r\nin one hundred and sixty-six years! Thus then Neptune is not M. Le\r\nVerrier’s planet; and all his theory as regards that planet falls to\r\nthe ground! M. Le Verrier may find another planet, but it will not\r\nanswer the calculations which he had made for Neptune. In the sitting\r\nof the 14th, M. Le Verrier noticed the communication of M. Babinet, and\r\nto a great extent admitted his own error! He complained indeed that\r\nmuch of what he said was taken in too absolute a sense; but he evinces\r\nmuch more candour than might have been expected from a disappointed\r\nexplorer. M. Le Verrier may console himself with the reflection that\r\nif he has not been so successful as he thought he had been, others\r\nmight have been equally unsuccessful, and as he has still before him\r\nan immense field for the exercise of observation and calculation, we\r\nmay hope that he will soon make some discovery which will remove the\r\nvexation of his present disappointment.”[34]\r\n\r\n  [34] “Times” Newspaper, Monday, Sept. 18, 1848.\r\n\r\n“As the data of Le Verrier and Adams stand at present there is a\r\ndiscrepancy between the predicted and the true distance; and in some\r\nother elements of the planet. It remains, therefore, for these or\r\nfuture astronomers to reconcile theory with fact; or, perhaps, as\r\nin the case of Uranus, to make the new planet the means of leading\r\nto yet greater discoveries. It would appear, from the most recent\r\nobservations, that the mass of Neptune, instead of being as at first\r\nstated one nine thousand three hundredth is only one twenty three\r\nthousandth that of the Sun; whilst its periodic time is now given\r\nwith a greater probability at 166 years; and its mean distance from\r\nthe Sun nearly thirty. Le Verrier gave the mean distance from the Sun\r\nthirty-six times that of the Earth; and the period of revolution 217\r\nyears.[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] “Cosmos,” by Humboldt, p. 75.\r\n\r\n“May 14, 1847. A Paper was read before the Royal Astronomical Society,\r\nby Professor Schumacher, ‘on the identity of the planet Neptune (M. Le\r\nVerrier’s) with a star observed by M. Lalande in May, 1795.’”[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] “Report of Royal Astronomical Society,” for Feb. 11, 1848, No. 4,\r\n  vol. 8.\r\n\r\nSuch mistakes as the above ought at least to make the advocates of the\r\nNewtonian theory less positive, and more ready to acknowledge that at\r\nbest their system is but hypothetical and must sooner or later give\r\nplace to a philosophy the premises of which are demonstrable, and which\r\nis in all its details sequent and consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENDULUM EXPERIMENTS AS PROOFS OF EARTH’S MOTION.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1851, the scientific journals and nearly\r\nall the newspapers published in Great Britain and on the Continents of\r\nEurope and America were occupied in recording and discussing certain\r\nexperiments with the pendulum, first made by M. Foucault, of Paris; and\r\nthe public were startled by the announcement that the results furnished\r\na practical proof of the Earth’s rotation.\r\n\r\nThe subject was referred to in the _Literary Gazette_, in the following\r\nwords:--“Everybody knows what is meant by a pendulum in its simplest\r\nform, a weight hanging by a thread to a fixed point. Such was the\r\npendulum experimented upon long ago by Galileo, who discovered the\r\nwell-known law of isochronous vibrations, applicable to the same. The\r\nsubject has since received a thorough examination, as well theoretical\r\nas practical, from mathematicians and mechanicians; and yet, strange\r\nto say, the most remarkable feature of the phenomenon has remained\r\nunobserved and wholly unsuspected until within the last few weeks, when\r\na young and promising French physicist, M. Foucault, who was induced by\r\ncertain reflections to repeat Galileo’s experiments in the cellar of\r\nhis mother’s house at Paris, succeeded in establishing the existence\r\nof a fact connected with it which gives an immediate and visible\r\ndemonstration of the Earth’s rotation. Suppose the pendulum already\r\ndescribed to be set moving in a vertical plane from north to south,\r\nthe plane in which it vibrates, to ordinary observation, would appear\r\nto be stationary. M. Foucault, however, has succeeded in showing that\r\nthis is not the case, but that the plane is itself slowly moving round\r\nthe fixed point as a centre in a direction contrary to the Earth’s\r\nrotation, _i.e._, with the apparent heavens, from east to west. His\r\nexperiments have since been repeated in the hall of the observatory,\r\nunder the superintendence of M. Arago, and fully confirmed. If a\r\npointer be attached to the weight of a pendulum suspended by a long and\r\nfine wire, capable of turning round in all directions, and nearly in\r\ncontact with the floor of a room, the line which this pointer appears\r\nto trace on the ground, and which may easily be followed by a chalk\r\nmark, will be found to be slowly, but visibly, and constantly moving\r\nround, like the hand of a watch dial; and the least consideration will\r\nshow that this ought to be the case, and will excite astonishment that\r\nso simple a consequence as this is, of the most elementary laws of\r\nGeometry and Mechanics, should so long have remained unobserved. * *\r\n* The subject has created a great sensation in the mathematical and\r\nphysical circles of Paris. It is proposed to obtain permission from\r\nthe Government to carry on further observations by means of a pendulum\r\nsuspended from the dome of the Pantheon, length of suspension being\r\na desideratum in order to make the result visible on a larger scale,\r\nand secure greater constancy and duration in the experiment. The time\r\nrequired for the performance of a complete revolution of the plane of\r\nvibration would be about 32 hours 8 minutes for the parallel of Paris;\r\n30 hours 40 minutes for that of London; and at 30 degrees from the\r\nequator exactly 48 hours. Certainly any one who should have proposed\r\nnot many weeks back to prove the rotation of the Earth upon which we\r\nstand by means of direct experiment made upon its surface would have\r\nrun the risk, with the mob of gentlemen who write upon mechanics, of\r\nbeing thought as mad as if he were to have proposed reviving Bishop\r\nWilkins’s notable plan for going to the North American colonies in a\r\nfew hours, by rising in a balloon from the Earth and gently floating\r\nin the air until the Earth, in its diurnal rotation, have turned the\r\ndesired quarter towards the suspended æronaut, whereupon as gently to\r\ndescend; so necessary and wholesome is it occasionally to reconsider\r\nthe apparently simplest and best established conclusions of science.”\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Scotsman_, which has always been\r\ndistinguished for the accuracy of its scientific papers. The article\r\nbears the initials “C. M.,” which will at once be recognised as those\r\nof Mr. Charles Maclaren, for many years the accomplished editor of\r\nthat journal:--“The beautiful experiment contrived by M. Foucault\r\nto demonstrate the rotation of the globe, has deservedly excited\r\nuniversal interest. * * * A desire has always been felt that some\r\nmethod could be devised of rendering this rotation palpable to the\r\nsenses. Even the illustrious Laplace participated in this feeling\r\nand has left it on record. ‘Although,’ he says, ‘the rotation of the\r\nEarth is now established with all the certainty which the physical\r\nsciences require, still a direct proof of that phenomenon ought to\r\ninterest both geometricians and astronomers.’ No man ever knew the\r\nlaws of the planetary motions better than Laplace, and before penning\r\nsuch a sentence, it is probable that he had turned the subject in his\r\nmind, and without discovering any process by which the object could be\r\nattained; but it does not follow that if he had applied the whole force\r\nof his genius to the task, he would not have succeeded. Be this as it\r\nmay, here we have the problem solved by a man not probably possessing\r\na tithe of his science or talent; and, what is very remarkable, after\r\nthe discovery was made, it was found to be legitimately deducible\r\nfrom mathematical principles. * * * In this, as in many other cases,\r\nthe _fact_ comes first, and takes us by surprise; after which we find\r\nthat we had long been in possession of the principles from which it\r\nflowed, and that, with the clue we had in our hands, theory should\r\nhave revealed the fact to us long before. M. Foucault’s communication\r\ndescribing his experiments is in the _Comptes Rendus_ of the Academy\r\nof Sciences, for 3rd February, 1851. His first experiments were made\r\nwith a pendulum only two metres (6ft. 6¹⁄₄in.) in length, consisting\r\nof a steel wire from ⁶⁄₁₀ths to ¹¹⁄₁₀ths of a millimetre in diameter\r\n(the millimetre is the 25th part of an inch); to the lower end of\r\nwhich was attached a polished brass ball, weighing 5 kilogrammes, or\r\n11 English pounds. * * * A metallic point projecting below the ball,\r\nand so directed as if it formed a continuation of the suspension wire,\r\nserved as an index to mark the change of position more precisely. The\r\npendulum hung from a steel plate in such a manner as to move freely in\r\nany vertical plane. To start the oscillatory movement without giving\r\nthe ball any bias, it was drawn to one side with a cord, which held\r\nthe ball by a loop; the cord was then burned, after which the loop\r\nfell off, and the vibrations (generally limited to an arc of 15 or 20\r\ndegrees) commenced. In one minute the ball had sensibly deviated from\r\nthe original plane of vibration towards the observer’s left. Afterwards\r\nhe experimented at the Observatory with a pendulum 11 metres (30 feet)\r\nlong, and latterly at the Pantheon with one still longer. The advantage\r\nof a large pendulum, as compared with a small one, is, that a longer\r\ntime elapses before it comes to a state of rest; for machinery cannot\r\nbe employed here, as in a clock, to continue the motion. The pendulum\r\nis suspended over the centre of a circular table, whose circumference\r\nis divided into degrees and minutes. The vibrations are begun in the\r\nmanner above described, and in a short time it is observed that the\r\npendulum, instead of returning to the same point of the circle from\r\nwhich it started, has shifted to the left. If narrowly observed, the\r\nchange in the plane of vibration (says M. Foucault) is perceptible\r\nin one minute, and in half an hour, “Il saute aux yeux,” it is quite\r\npalpable. At Paris the change exceeds 11 degrees in an hour. Thus,\r\nsupposing the oscillations to commence in a plane directed south and\r\nnorth, in two hours the oscillations will point SSW. and NNE.; in four\r\nhours they will point SW. and NE.; and in eight hours the oscillations\r\nwill point due east and west, or at right angles to their original\r\ndirection. To a spectator the change seems to be in the pendulum,\r\nwhich, without any visible cause, has shifted round a quarter of a\r\ncircle; but the real change is in the table, which, resting on the\r\nEarth, and accompanying it in its rotation, has performed a fourth (and\r\nsomething more) of its diurnal revolution.\r\n\r\nNo one anticipated such a result; and the experiment has been received\r\nby some with incredulity, by all with wonderment; and one source of the\r\nincredulity arises from the difficulty of conceiving how, amidst the\r\nten thousand experiments of which the pendulum has been the subject, so\r\nremarkable a fact could have escaped notice so long. Fully admitting\r\nthat these experiments have generally been conducted with pendulums\r\nwhich had little freedom of motion horizontally, we still think odd\r\nthat somebody did not stumble upon the curious fact.\r\n\r\nThough all the parts of the Earth complete their revolution in the\r\nsame space of time, it is found that the rate of horizontal motion\r\nin Foucault’s pendulum varies with the latitude of the place where\r\nthe experiment is made. At the pole, the pendulum would pass over 15\r\ndegrees in an hour, like the Earth itself, and complete its circuit in\r\n24 hours. At Edinburgh, the pendulum would pass over 12¹⁄₂ degrees in\r\nan hour, and would complete its revolution in 29 hours 7 minutes. At\r\nParis, the rate of motion is 11 degrees and 20 minutes per hour, and\r\nthe revolution should be completed in 32 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nLet the above figure represent a portion of the Earth’s surface near\r\nthe north pole N. Suppose the pendulum to be set in motion at _m_, so\r\nas to vibrate in the direction _x y_, which coincides with that of the\r\nmeridian _m_ N or _m r_. The Earth in the meantime is pursuing its\r\neasterly course, and the meridian line _m_ N has come in six hours into\r\nthe position _n_ N. It has been hitherto supposed that the pendulum\r\nwould now vibrate in the new direction _n_ N, assumed by the meridian,\r\nbut thanks to M. Foucault, we now know that this is a mistake. The\r\npendulum will vibrate in a plane _x n y_, parallel to its original\r\nplane at _m_, as will be manifest if the plane of vibration points to\r\nsome object in absolute space, such as a star. While the meridian line\r\n_m_ N will in the course of 24 hours range round the whole circle of\r\nthe heavens, and point successively in the direction _n_ N, _o_ N, _p_\r\nN, _r_ N, _s_ N, _t_ N, and _u_ N, the pendulum’s plane of vibration\r\n_x y_, whether at _m_, at _n_, at _o_, at _p_, at _r_, at _s_, at _t_,\r\nor at _u_, will always be parallel to itself, pointing invariably to\r\nthe same star, and were a circular table placed under the pendulum, its\r\nplane of vibration, while really stationary, would appear to perform a\r\ncomplete revolution.\r\n\r\nThis stationary position of the plane of vibration at the pole seems\r\nto present little difficulty. We impress a peculiar motion on the\r\npendulum in setting it a going. The Earth is at the same time carrying\r\nthe pendulum eastward, but _at the pole_ the one motion will not\r\ninterfere with the other. The only action of the Earth on the pendulum\r\nthere is that of attracting it towards its own (the Earth’s) centre.\r\nBut this attraction is exactly in the plane of vibration and merely\r\ntends to continue the oscillatory motion without disturbing it. It\r\nis otherwise if the experiment is made at some other point, say 20\r\ndegrees distant from the pole. Supposing the vibrations to commence in\r\nthe plane of the meridian, then as the tendency of the pendulum is to\r\ncontinue its vibrations in planes absolutely parallel to the original\r\nplane, it will be seen, if we trace both motions, that, while it is\r\ncarried eastward with the Earth along a parallel of latitude, this\r\ntendency will operate to draw the plane of vibration away from a ‘great\r\ncircle’ into a ‘small circle’ (that is, from a circle dividing the\r\nglobe into two _equal_ parts, into one dividing it into two _unequal_\r\nparts). But the pendulum _must_ necessarily move in a ‘great circle,’\r\nand hence to counteract its tendency to deviate into a ‘small circle,’\r\na correctory movement is constantly going on, to which the lengthening\r\nof the period necessary to complete a revolution must be ascribed. At\r\nEdinburgh the period is about 29 hours, at Paris 32, at Cairo 48, at\r\nCalcutta 63. At the Equator, the period stretches out to infinity. M.\r\nFoucault’s rule is, that the angular space passed over by the pendulum\r\nat any latitude in a given time, is equal to the angular motion of\r\nthe Earth in the period, multiplied by the sine of the latitude.\r\nThe angular motion of the Earth is 15 degrees per hour; and at the\r\nlatitude of 30, for example, the sine being to radius as 500 to 1000,\r\nthe angular motion of the pendulum will consequently be 7¹⁄₂ degrees per\r\nhour. It is, therefore, easily found. It follows that the motions of\r\nthe pendulum may be employed in a rough way to indicate the latitude of\r\na place.”[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] Supplement of the _Manchester Examiner_, of May 24, 1851.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the apparent certainty of these pendulum experiments,\r\nand the supposed exactitude of the conclusions deducible therefrom,\r\nmany of the same school of philosophy differed with each other,\r\nremained dissatisfied, and raised very serious objections both to the\r\nvalue of the experiments themselves, and to the supposed proof which\r\nthey furnished of the Earth’s rotation. One writer in the _Times_\r\nnewspaper of the period, who signs himself “B. A. C.,” says, “I have\r\nread the accounts of the Parisian experiment as they have appeared in\r\nmany of our papers, and must confess that I still remain unconvinced\r\nof the reality of the phenomenon. It appears to me that, except at\r\nthe pole where the point of suspension is immovable, no result can\r\nbe obtained. In other cases the shifting of the direction of passage\r\nthrough the lowest point that takes place during an excursion of\r\nthe pendulum, from that point in one direction and its return to it\r\nagain, will be exactly compensated by the corresponding shifting in\r\nthe contrary direction during the pendulum’s excursion on the opposite\r\nside. Take a particular case. Suppose the pendulum in any latitude to\r\nbe set oscillating in the meridian plane, and to be started from the\r\nvertical towards the south. It is obvious that the wire by which it\r\nis suspended _does not continue to describe a plane_, but a species\r\nof conoidal surface; that when the pendulum has reached its extreme\r\npoint its direction is to the south-west, and that as the tangent plane\r\nto the described surface through the point of suspension necessarily\r\ncontains the normal to the Earth at the same point, the pendulum on\r\nits return passes through the same point in the direction north-east.\r\nNow, starting again from this point, we have exactly the circumstances\r\nof the last case, the primary plane being shifted slightly out of the\r\nmeridian; when, therefore, the pendulum has reached its extreme point\r\nof excursion the direction of the wire is to the west of this plane,\r\nand when it returns to the vertical the direction of passage through\r\nthe lowest point is as much to the west of this plane as it was in the\r\nformer case to the west of the meridian plane; but since it is now\r\nmoving from north to south instead of from south to north, as in the\r\nformer case, its former deviation receives complete compensation, and\r\nthe primary plane returns again to the meridian, when the whole process\r\nrecurs.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Liverpool Mercury_ of May 23, 1851, the following letter\r\nappeared:--“The supposed manifestation of the Rotation of the\r\nEarth.--The French, English, and European continental journals have\r\ngiven publicity to an experiment made in Paris with a pendulum; which\r\nexperiment is said to have had the same results when made elsewhere.\r\nTo the facts set forth no contradiction has been given, and it is\r\ntherefore to be hoped that they are true. The correctness of the\r\ninferences drawn from the facts is another matter. The first position\r\nof these theorists is, that in a complete vacuum beyond the sphere of\r\nthe Earth’s atmosphere, a pendulum will continue to oscillate in one\r\nand the same original plane. On that supposition their whole theory is\r\nfounded. In making this supposition the fact is overlooked that there\r\n_is no vibratory motion_ unless through atmospheric resistance, or by\r\nforce opposing impulse. Perpetual progress in rectilinear motion may be\r\nimagined, as in the corpuscular theory of light; circular motion may\r\nalso be found in the planetary systems; and parabolic and hyperbolic\r\nmotions in those of comets; but vibration is artificial and of limited\r\nduration. No body in nature returns the same road it went, unless\r\nartificially constrained to do so. The supposition of a permanent\r\nvibratory motion such as is presumed in the theory advanced, is\r\n_unfounded in fact_, and absurd in idea; and the whole affair of this\r\nproclaimed discovery falls to the ground. It is what the French call a\r\n‘mystification’--anglice a ‘humbug.’ Liverpool, 22nd May, 1851.”\r\n\r\n  “T.”\r\n\r\nAnother writer declared that he and others had made many experiments\r\nand had discovered that the plane of vibration had nothing whatever\r\nto do with the meridian longitude nor with the Earth’s motion, but\r\nfollowed the plane of the magnetic meridian.\r\n\r\n“A scientific gentleman in Dundee recently tried the pendulum\r\nexperiment, and he says--‘that the pendulum is capable of showing the\r\nEarth’s motion I regard as a _gross delusion_; but that it tends to the\r\n_magnetic meridian_ I have found to be a fact.’”[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] _Liverpool Journal_, May 17, 1851.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the experiments have not shown a change at all in the\r\nplane of oscillation of the pendulum; in others the alteration in\r\nthe plane of vibration has been in the _wrong direction_; and very\r\noften the _rate of variation_ has been altogether different to that\r\nwhich theory indicated. The following is a case in illustration:--“On\r\nWednesday evening the Rev. H. H. Jones, F.R.A.S., exhibited the\r\napparatus of Foucault to illustrate the diurnal rotation of the Earth,\r\nin the Library Hall of the Manchester Athenæum. The preparations\r\nwere simple. A circle of chalk was drawn in the centre of the floor,\r\nimmediately under the arched skylight. The circle was exactly 360\r\ninches in its circumference, every inch being intended to represent\r\none degree. According to a calculation Mr. Jones had made, and which\r\nhe produced at the Philosophical Society six weeks ago, the plane of\r\noscillation of the pendulum would, at Manchester, diverge about one\r\ndegree in five minutes, or perhaps a very little less. He therefore\r\ndrew this circle exactly 360 inches round, and marked the inches on\r\nits circumference. The pendulum was hung from the skylight immediately\r\nover the centre of the circle, the point of suspension being 25 feet\r\nhigh. At that length of wire, it should require 2¹⁄₂ seconds to make\r\neach oscillation across the circle. The brazen ball, which at the end\r\nof a fine wire constituted the pendulum, was furnished with a point,\r\nto enable the spectator to observe the more easily its course. A long\r\nline was drawn through the diameter of the circle, due north and south,\r\nand the pendulum started so as to swing exactly along this line; to the\r\nwestward of which, at intervals of three inches at the circumference,\r\ntwo other lines were drawn, passing through the centre. According\r\nto the theory, the pendulum should diverge from its original line\r\ntowards the west, at the rate of one inch or degree in five minutes.\r\nThis, however, Mr. Jones explained, was a perfection of accuracy only\r\nattainable in a vacuum, and rarely could be approached where the\r\npendulum had to pass through an atmosphere subject to disturbances;\r\nbesides, it was difficult to avoid giving it some slight lateral bias\r\nat starting. In order to obviate this as much as possible, the steel\r\nwire was as fine as would bear the weight, ¹⁄₃₀th of an inch thick;\r\nand the point of suspension was adjusted with delicate nicety. An iron\r\nbolt was screwed into the frame-work of the skylight; into it a brass\r\nnut was inserted--the wire passed through the nut (the hollow sides\r\nof which were bell-shaped, in order to give it fair play), and at the\r\ntop the wire ended in a globular piece, there being also a fine screw\r\nto keep it from slipping. * * * The pendulum was gently drawn up to\r\none side, at the southern end of the diametrical line, and attached\r\nby a thread to something near. When it hung quite still the thread was\r\nburnt asunder, and the pendulum began to oscillate to and fro across\r\nthe circle. * * * Before it had been going on quite seven minutes,\r\nit had reached nearly the third degree towards the west, whereas it\r\n_ought_ to have occupied a quarter of an hour in getting thus far from\r\nits starting line, even making no allowance for the resistance of the\r\natmosphere.”[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] “Manchester Examiner” (Supplement), May 24, 1851.\r\n\r\nBesides the irregularities so often observed in the time and direction\r\nof the pendulum vibrations, and which are quite sufficient to render\r\nthem worthless as evidence of the Earth’s motion, the use which\r\nthe Newtonian astronomers made of the general fact that the plane\r\nof oscillation is variable, was most unfair and illogical. It was\r\nproclaimed to the world as a visible proof of the Earth’s diurnal\r\nmotion; but the motion was _assumed to exist_, and then employed to\r\nexplain the cause of the fact which was first called a proof of the\r\nthing assumed! A greater violation of the laws of investigation was\r\nnever perpetrated! The whole subject as developed and applied by the\r\ntheoretical philosophers is to the fullest degree unreasonable and\r\nabsurd--not a “jot or tittle” better than the reasoning contained\r\nin the following letter:--“Sir,--Allow me to call your serious and\r\npolite attention to the extraordinary phenomenon, demonstrating the\r\nrotation of the Earth, which I at this present moment experience, and\r\nyou yourself or anybody else, I have not the slightest doubt, would\r\nbe satisfied of, under similar circumstances. Some sceptical and\r\nobstinate individuals may doubt that the Earth’s motion is visible,\r\nbut I say from personal observation its a positive fact. I don’t\r\ncare about latitude or longitude, or a vibratory pendulum revolving\r\nround the sine of a tangent on a spherical surface, nor axes, nor\r\napsides, nor anything of the sort. That is all rubbish. All I know\r\nis, I see the ceiling of this coffee-room going round. I perceive\r\nthis distinctly with the naked eye--only my sight has been sharpened\r\nby a slight stimulant. I write after my sixth go of brandy-and-water,\r\nwhereof witness my hand,”--“Swiggins”--_Goose and Gridiron, May 5,\r\n1851._--“P.S. Why do two waiters come when I only call one?”[40]\r\n\r\n  [40] “Punch,” May 10, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter as handled by the astronomical theorists is fully\r\ndeserving of the ridicule implied in the above quotation from _Punch_;\r\nbut because great ingenuity has been shewn, and much thought and\r\ndevotion manifested in connection with it, and the general public\r\nthereby greatly deceived, it is necessary that the subject should be\r\nfairly and seriously examined. What are the facts?\r\n\r\nFirst.--When a pendulum, constructed according to the plan of M.\r\nFoucault, is allowed to vibrate, its plane of vibration is often\r\nvariable--_not always_. The variation when it _does_ occur, is _not\r\nuniform_--is not always the same in the same place; nor always the\r\nsame either in its rate or velocity, or in its direction. It cannot\r\ntherefore be taken as evidence; for that which is inconstant cannot be\r\nused in favour of or against any given proposition. It therefore _is\r\nnot evidence and proves nothing_!\r\n\r\nSecondly.--If the plane of vibration _is_ observed to change, where\r\nis the connection between such change and the supposed motion of the\r\nEarth? What principle of reasoning guides the experimenter to the\r\nconclusion that it is the Earth which moves underneath the pendulum,\r\nand not the pendulum which moves over the Earth? What logical right or\r\nnecessity forces one conclusion in preference to the other?\r\n\r\nThirdly.--Why was not the peculiar arrangement of the point of\r\nsuspension of the pendulum specially considered, in regard to its\r\npossible influence upon the plane of oscillation? Was it not known, or\r\nwas it overlooked, or was it, in the climax of theoretical revelry,\r\nignored that a “ball-and-socket” joint is one which facilitates\r\n_circular_ motion more readily than any other? and that a pendulum so\r\nsuspended (as was M. Foucault’s), could not, after passing over one\r\narc of vibration, return through the same arc without there being many\r\nchances to one that its globular point of suspension would slightly\r\nturn or twist in its bed, and therefore give to the return or backward\r\noscillation a slight change of direction? Let the _immediate cause_ of\r\nthe pendulum’s liability to change its plane of vibration be traced;\r\nand it will be found not to have the slightest connection with the\r\nmotion or non-motion of the surface over which it vibrates.\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the French Academy of sciences, “M. Dehaut sent\r\nin a note, stating that M. Foucault (whose experiments on the pendulum\r\neffected a few years ago at the Pantheon, are of European notoriety) is\r\nnot the first discoverer of the fact that the plane of oscillation of\r\nthe free pendulum is invariable; but that the honour of the discovery\r\nis due to Poinsinet de Sivry, who, in 1782, stated, in a note to his\r\ntranslation of ‘Pliny,’ that a mariner’s compass might be constructed\r\nwithout a magnet, by making a pendulum and setting it in motion in a\r\ngiven direction; because, provided the motion were continually kept\r\nup, the pendulum would continue to oscillate in the same direction, no\r\nmatter by how many points, or how often the ship might happen to change\r\nher course.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 13.\r\n\r\nPERSPECTIVE ON THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown (at pages 25 to 34) that the law of perspective, as\r\ncommonly taught in our Schools of Art, is fallacious and contrary to\r\neverything seen in nature. If an object be held up in the air, and\r\ngradually carried away from an observer who maintains his position, it\r\nis true that all its parts will converge to one and the same point; but\r\nif the same object be placed upon the ground and similarly moved away\r\nfrom a fixed observer, the same predicate is false. In the first case\r\nthe _centre_ of the object is the _datum_ to which every point of the\r\nexterior converges; but in the second case the _ground_ becomes the\r\n_datum_, in and towards which every part of the object converges in\r\nsuccession, beginning with the lowest, or that nearest to it.\r\n\r\nInstances:--A man with light trousers and black boots walking along a\r\nlevel path, will appear at a certain distance as though the boots had\r\nbeen removed, and the trousers brought in contact with the ground.\r\n\r\nA young girl, with short garments terminating ten or twelve inches\r\nabove the feet, will, in walking forward, appear to sink towards the\r\nEarth, the space between which and the bottom of the clothes will\r\nappear to gradually diminish, and in the distance of half-a-mile\r\nthe limbs, which were first seen for ten or twelve inches, will be\r\ninvisible--the bottom of the garment will seem to touch the ground.\r\n\r\nA small dog running along will appear to gradually shorten by the legs,\r\nwhich, in less than half a mile, will be invisible, and the body appear\r\nto glide upon the earth.\r\n\r\nHorses and cattle moving away from a given point will seem to have lost\r\ntheir hoofs, and to be walking upon the outer bones of the limbs.\r\n\r\nCarriages similarly receding will seem to lose that portion of the\r\nrim of the wheels which touches the Earth; the axles will seem to get\r\nlower; and at the distance of a few miles, the body will appear to\r\ndrag along in contact with the ground. This is very remarkable in the\r\ncase of a railway carriage when moving away upon a straight and level\r\nportion of line several miles in length. These instances, which are\r\nbut a few of what might be quoted, will be sufficient to prove, beyond\r\nthe power of doubt or the necessity for controversy, that upon a plane\r\nor horizontal surface, the _lowest part_ of bodies receding from a\r\ngiven point of observation will disappear _before the higher_. This is\r\nprecisely what is observed in the case of a ship at sea, when outward\r\nbound--the _lowest_ part--the hull, disappearing before the higher\r\nparts--the sails and mast head. Abstractedly, when the lowest part of\r\na receding object thus disappears by entering the “vanishing point,”\r\nit could be seen again to any and every extent by a telescope, if the\r\npower were sufficient to magnify at the distance observed. This is to\r\na great extent practicable upon smooth horizontal surfaces, as upon\r\nfrozen lakes or canals; and upon long straight lines of railway. But\r\nthe power of restoring such objects is greatly modified and diminished\r\nwhere the surface is undulating or otherwise moveable, as in large and\r\nlevel meadows, and pasture lands generally; in the vast prairies and\r\ngrassy plains of America; and especially so upon the ocean, where the\r\nsurface is always more or less in an undulating condition. In Holland\r\nand other level countries, persons have been seen in winter, skating\r\nupon the ice, at distances varying from ten to twenty miles. On some\r\nof the straight and “level” lines of railway which cross the prairies\r\nof America, the trains have been observed for more than twenty miles;\r\nbut upon the sea the conditions are altered, and the hull of a receding\r\nvessel can only be seen for a few miles, and this will depend very\r\ngreatly--the altitude of the observer being the same, upon the state of\r\nthe water. When the surface is calm, the hull may be seen much farther\r\nthan when it is rough and stormy; but under ordinary circumstances,\r\nwhen to the naked eye the hull has just become invisible, or is\r\ndoubtfully visible, it may be seen again distinctly by the aid of a\r\npowerful telescope. Although abstractedly or mathematically there\r\nshould be no limit to this power of restoring by a telescope a lost\r\nobject upon a smooth horizontal surface, upon the sea this limit is\r\nsoon observed; the water being variable in its degree of agitation, the\r\nlimit of sight over its surface is equally variable, as shown by the\r\nfollowing experiments:--In May, 1864, on several occasions when the\r\nwater was unusually calm, from the landing stairs of the Victoria pier\r\nat Portsmouth, and from an elevation of 2 ft. 8 in. above the water,\r\nthe greater part of the hull of the Nab Light-ship was, through a good\r\ntelescope, distinctly visible; but on other experiments being made,\r\nwhen the water was less calm, no portion of it could be seen from the\r\nsame elevation, notwithstanding that the most powerful telescopes were\r\nemployed. At other times half the hull, and sometimes only the upper\r\npart of the bulwarks, were visible. If the hull had been invisible\r\nfrom the rotundity of the Earth, the following calculation will show\r\nthat it should at all times have been 24 feet below the horizon:--The\r\ndistance of the light-ship from the pier is 8 statute miles. The\r\nelevation of the observer being 32 inches above the water, would\r\nrequire 2 miles to be deducted as the distance of the supposed convex\r\nhorizon; for the square of 2 multiplied by 8 inches (the fall in the\r\nfirst mile of the Earth’s curvation) equals 32 inches. This deducted\r\nfrom the 8 miles, will leave 6 miles as the distance from the horizon\r\nto the light ship. Hence 6² × 8 in. = 288 inches, or 24 feet. The top\r\nof the bulwarks, it was said, rose about 10 ft. above the water line;\r\nhence, deducting 10 from 24 feet, under all circumstances, even had the\r\nwater been perfectly smooth and stationary, the top of the hull should\r\nhave been 14 feet below the summit of the arc of water, or beneath\r\nthe line of sight! This one fact is entirely fatal to the doctrine of\r\nthe Earth’s rotundity. But such facts have been observed in various\r\nother places--the north-west light-ship in Liverpool Bay, and the\r\nlight vessels of many other channels near the southern, eastern, and\r\nwestern shores of Great Britain. From the beach of Southsea Common,\r\nnear Portsmouth, the observer lying down near the water, above the\r\nsurface of which the eye was 2¹⁄₂ feet, and with a telescope looking\r\nacross Spithead to the quarantine ship lying in the “Roads,” between\r\nRyde and Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, a distance of 7 miles, the copper\r\nsheathing of that vessel was distinctly seen, the depth of which was\r\nabout 2 feet. Making the usual calculation in accordance with the\r\ndoctrine of the Earth’s convexity, it will be seen that an arc of water\r\nought to have existed between the two points, the summit of which arc\r\nshould have been 16 feet above the copper sheathing of the vessel!\r\n\r\nFrom an elevation of 2¹⁄₂ feet above the water opposite the Royal Yacht\r\nClub House, in West Cowes, Isle of Wight, the pile work and promenade\r\nof the pier at Stake’s Bay, near Gosport, and nearly opposite Osborne\r\nHouse, were easily distinguished through various telescopes: the\r\ndistance is 7 miles, the altitude of the promenade 10 feet, and the\r\nusual calculation will show that this pier ought to have been many feet\r\nbelow the horizon!\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the light of the Eddystone lighthouse is\r\noften plainly visible from the beach in Plymouth Sound; and sometimes,\r\nwhen the sea is very calm, persons can see it distinctly when sitting\r\nin ordinary rowing boats in that part of the Sound which will allow\r\nthe line of sight to pass between Drake’s Island and the western end\r\nof the Breakwater. The distance is 14 statute miles. In a list of\r\nlighthouses in a work called “The Lighthouses of the World,” by A. G.\r\nFindlay, F.R.G.S., published in 1862, by Richard H. Lawrie, 53, Fleet\r\nStreet, London, it is said, at page 28:--“In the Tables the height of\r\nthe flame above the highest tide high water level is given, so that\r\nit is the _minimum_ range of the light; to this elevation 10 feet is\r\nadded for the height of the deck of the ship above the sea. Besides\r\nthe increased distance to which low water will cause the light to be\r\nseen, the effect of refraction will also sometimes increase their\r\nrange.” In the “Tables” above referred to, at page 36 the Eddystone\r\nlight is said to be visible 13 miles. But these 13 miles are nautical\r\nmeasure; and as 3 nautical miles equal 3¹⁄₂ statute miles, the distance\r\nat which the Eddystone light is visible is over 15 statute miles.\r\nNotwithstanding that the Eddystone light is actually visible at a\r\ndistance of 15 statute miles, and admitted to be so both by the\r\nAdmiralty authorities and by calculation according to the doctrine\r\nof rotundity, very often at the same distance, the lantern is not\r\nvisible at an elevation of 4 feet from the water; showing that the\r\nlaw of perspective, previously referred to, is greatly influenced by\r\nthe state of the surface of the water over which the line of sight\r\nis directed. A remarkable illustration of this influence is given in\r\nthe _Western Daily Mercury_, published in Plymouth, of October 25,\r\n1864. Several discussions had previously taken place at the Plymouth\r\nAthenæum and the Devonport Mechanics’ Institute, on the true figure of\r\nthe Earth; subsequent to which a committee was formed for the purpose\r\nof making experiments bearing on the question at issue. The names of\r\nthe gentlemen as given in the above-named journal were “Parallax” (the\r\nauthor of this work), “Theta” (Mr. Henry, a teacher in Her Majesty’s\r\nDock-yard, Devonport), and Messrs. Osborne, Richards, Rickard, Mogg,\r\nEvers, and Pearce, all of Plymouth. From the report published as above\r\nstated, the following quotation is made:--Observation 6th: “_On the\r\nbeach, at 5 feet from the water level, the Eddystone was entirely out\r\nof sight_.”\r\n\r\nThe matter may be summarized as follows:--At any time when the sea is\r\ncalm and the weather clear, the Light of the Eddystone, which is 89\r\nfeet above the foundation on the rock, may be distinctly seen from an\r\nelevation of 5 feet above the water level; according to the Admiralty\r\ndirections, it “may be seen 13 nautical (or 15 statute) miles,”[41] or\r\none mile still farther away than the position of the observers on the\r\nabove-named occasion; and yet _on that occasion_, and at a distance of\r\nonly 14 statute miles, notwithstanding that it was a very fine autumn\r\nday, and a clear back ground existed, not only was the lantern, which\r\nis 89 feet high, not visible, but the _top of the vane_, which is 100\r\nfeet above the foundation was, as stated in the report, “_entirely out\r\nof sight_.”\r\n\r\n  [41] “Lighthouses of the World,” p. 36.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nThat vessels and lighthouses are sometimes more distinctly seen than\r\nat others; and that the lower parts of such objects are sooner lost\r\nsight of when the sea is rough than when it is calm, are items in the\r\nexperience of seafaring people as common as their knowledge of the\r\nchanges in the weather; and prominence is only given here to the above\r\ncase because it was verified by persons of different opinions upon the\r\nsubject of the Earth’s form, and in the presence of several hundreds\r\nof the most learned and respectable inhabitants of Plymouth and the\r\nneighbourhood. The conclusion which such observations necessitate and\r\nforce upon us is, that the law of perspective which is everywhere\r\nvisible on land, is _modified_ when observed in connection with objects\r\nupon or near the sea. But _how_ modified? If the water of the ocean\r\nwere frozen and at perfect rest, any object upon its surface would be\r\nseen as far as telescopic or magnifying power could be brought to bear\r\nupon it. But because this is not the case--because the water is always\r\nmore or less in motion, not only of progression but of fluctuation,\r\nthe swells and waves, into which the surface is broken operate to\r\nprevent the line of sight from passing parallel to the horizontal\r\nsurface of the water. It has been shown at pages 16 to 20, and also\r\nat 25 to 33, that the surface of the Earth and Sea appears to rise up\r\nto the level, or altitude of the eye; and that at a certain distance\r\nthe line of sight and the surface which is parallel to it appear to\r\nconverge to a “vanishing point;” which point is “the horizon.” If this\r\nhorizon, or vanishing point, were formed by the apparent junction of\r\ntwo _perfectly stationary_ parallel lines, it could be penetrated by a\r\ntelescope of sufficient power to magnify at the distance; but because\r\nupon the sea the surface of the water is _not stationary_, the line of\r\nsight at the vanishing point becomes angular instead of parallel, and\r\ntelescopic power is of little avail in restoring objects beyond this\r\npoint. The following diagram will render this clear:--The horizontal\r\nline C D E and the line of sight A B are parallel to each other, and\r\nappear to meet at the vanishing point B. But at and about this point\r\nthe line A B is intercepted by the undulating, or fluctuating surface\r\nof the water; the degree of which is variable, being sometimes very\r\ngreat and at others inconsiderable, and having to pass over the crest\r\nof the waves, as at H, is obliged to become A H, instead of A B, and\r\nwill therefore fall upon a ship, lighthouse, or other object at the\r\npoint S, or higher or lower as such objects are more or less beyond the\r\npoint H.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the waves at the point H, whatever their\r\nreal magnitude may be, are _magnified_ and rendered more obstructive\r\nby the very instrument--the telescope--which is employed to make the\r\nobjects beyond more plainly visible: and thus the phenomenon is often\r\nvery strikingly observed--that while a powerful telescope will render\r\nthe sails and rigging of a ship when beyond the point H, or the optical\r\nhorizon, so distinct that the very ropes are easily distinguished, not\r\nthe slightest portion of the hull can be seen. The “crested waters”\r\nform a barrier to the horizontal line-of-sight, as substantial as would\r\nthe summit of an intervening rock or island.\r\n\r\nIn the report which appeared in the _Western Daily Mercury_, of Oct.\r\n25, 1864, the following observations were also recorded:--“On the\r\nsea-front of the Camera house, and at an elevation of 110 feet from\r\nthe mean level of the sea, a plane mirror was fixed, by the aid of a\r\nplumb-line, in a _true vertical position_. In this mirror the distant\r\nhorizon was distinctly visible on a level with the eye of the observer.\r\nThis was the simple fact, as observed by the several members of the\r\ncommittee which had been appointed. But some of the observers remarked\r\nthat the line of the horizon in the mirror rose and fell with the\r\neye, as also did every thing else which was reflected, and that this\r\nought to be recorded as an _addendum_--granted. The surface of the sea\r\nappeared to regularly ascend from the base of the Hoe to the distant\r\nhorizon. The horizon from the extreme east to the west, as far as the\r\neye could see, was parallel to a horizontal line.”\r\n\r\nThe following version was recorded in the same journal, of the same\r\ndate, and was furnished by one of the committee who had manifested a\r\nvery marked aversion to the doctrine that the surface of all water is\r\nhorizontal:--“A vertical looking-glass was suspended from the Camera\r\nand the horizon seen in it, as well as various other objects reflected,\r\nrising and falling with the eye. The water was seen in the glass to\r\nascend from the base of the Hoe to the horizon. The horizon appeared\r\nparallel to a horizontal line.”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the two reports are substantially the same,\r\nand very strongly corroborate the remarks made at pages 15, 16, and\r\n17 of this work. Indeed no other report could have been given without\r\nthe author’s becoming subject to the charge of glaring, obstinate, and\r\nwilful misrepresentation. What then has again been demonstrated? That\r\nthe surface of all water _is horizontal_, and that, therefore, the\r\nEarth cannot possibly be anything other than a Plane. All appearances\r\nto the contrary have been shown to be purely optical and adventitious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\nAnother proof that the surface of all water is horizontal and that\r\ntherefore the Earth cannot be a globe is furnished by the following\r\nexperiment, which was made in May, 1864, on the new pier at Southsea,\r\nnear Portsmouth:--A telescope was fixed upon a stand and directed\r\nacross the water at Spithead to the pier head at Ryde, in the Isle of\r\nWight, as shown in the subjoined diagram. The line of sight crossed\r\na certain part of the funnel of one of the regular steamers trading\r\nbetween Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight; and it was observed to cut\r\nor fall upon the same part during the whole of the passage to Ryde\r\nPier, thus proving that the water between the two piers is horizontal,\r\nbecause it was parallel to the line of sight from the telescope fixed\r\nat Southsea. If the Earth were a globe the channel between Ryde and\r\nSouthsea would be an arc of a circle, and as the distance across is\r\n4¹⁄₂ statute miles the centre of the arc would be 40 inches higher\r\nthan the two sides; and the steamer would have ascended an inclined\r\nplane for 2¹⁄₄ miles, or to the centre of the channel, and afterwards\r\ndescended for the same distance towards Ryde. This ascent and descent\r\nwould have been marked by the line of sight falling 40 inches nearer\r\nto the deck of the steamer when on the centre of the arc of water, as\r\nrepresented in the following diagram; but as the line of sight did\r\nnot cut the steamer lower down when in the centre of the channel, and\r\nno such ascent and descent was observed, it follows necessarily that\r\nthe surface of the water between Southsea and the Isle of Wight is\r\n_not convex_, and therefore the Earth as a whole is _not a globe_. The\r\nevidence against the doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity is so clear\r\nand perfect, and so completely fulfils the conditions required in\r\nspecial and independent investigations, that it is impossible for\r\nany person who can put aside the bias of previous education to avoid\r\nthe opposite conclusion that the _Earth is a plane_. This conclusion\r\nis greatly confirmed by the experience of mariners in regard to\r\ncertain lighthouses. Where the light is fixed and very brilliant it\r\ncan be seen at a distance, which the present doctrine of the Earth’s\r\nrotundity would render altogether impossible. For instance, at page 35\r\nof “Lighthouses of the World,” the Ryde Pier Light, erected in 1852,\r\nis described as a bright fixed light, 21 feet above high water, and\r\nvisible from an altitude of 10 feet at the distance of 12 nautical or\r\n14 statute miles. The altitude of 10 feet would place the horizon at\r\nthe distance of 4 statute miles from the observer. The square of the\r\nremaining 10 statute miles multiplied by 8 inches will give a fall or\r\ncurvature downwards from the horizon of 66 feet. Deduct from this 21\r\nfeet, the altitude of the light, and we have 45 feet as the amount\r\nwhich the light ought to be _below the horizon_!\r\n\r\nBy the same authority, at page 39, the Bidston Hill Lighthouse, near\r\nLiverpool, is 228 feet above high water, one bright fixed light,\r\nvisible 23 nautical or very nearly 27 statute miles. Deducting 4 miles\r\nfor the height of the observer, squaring the remaining 23 miles and\r\nmultiplying that product by 8 inches we have a downward curvature of\r\n352 feet; from this deduct the altitude of the light, 228 feet, and\r\nthere remains 124 feet as the distance which the light should be _below\r\nthe horizon_!\r\n\r\nAgain, at page 40:--“The lower light on the ‘Calf of Man’ is 282\r\nfeet above high water, and is visible 23 nautical miles.” The usual\r\ncalculation will show that it ought to be 70 feet _below the horizon_!\r\n\r\nAt page 41 the Cromer light is described as having an altitude of 274\r\nfeet above high water, and is visible 23 nautical miles, whereas it\r\nought to be at that distance 78 feet _below the horizon_!\r\n\r\nAt page 9 it is said:--“The coal fire (which was once used) on\r\nthe Spurn Point Lighthouse, at the mouth of the Humber, which was\r\nconstructed on a good principle for burning, has been seen 30 miles\r\noff.” If the miles here given are nautical measure they would be equal\r\nto 35 statute miles. Deducting 4 miles as the usual amount for the\r\ndistance of the horizon, there will remain 31 miles, which squared and\r\nmultiplied by 8 inches will give 640 feet as the declination of the\r\nwater from the horizon to the base of the Lighthouse, the altitude of\r\nwhich is given at page 42 as 93 feet above high water. This amount\r\ndeducted from the above 640 feet will leave 547 feet as the distance\r\nwhich the Spurn Light ought to have been _below the horizon_!\r\n\r\nThe two High Whitby Lights are 240 feet above high water (see page 42),\r\nand are visible 23 nautical miles at sea. The proper calculation will\r\nbe 102 feet _below the horizon_!\r\n\r\nAt page 43, it is said that the Lower Farne Island Light is visible for\r\n12 nautical or 14 statute miles, and the height above high water is 45\r\nfeet. The usual calculation will show that this light ought to be 67\r\nfeet _below the horizon_!\r\n\r\nThe Hekkengen Light, on the west coast of Norway (see page 54), is 66\r\nfeet above high water, and visible 16 statute miles. It ought to be\r\nsunk beneath the horizon 30 feet!\r\n\r\nThe Trondhjem Light (see p. 55), on the Ringholm Rock, west coast of\r\nNorway, is 51 feet high, and is visible 16 statute miles; but ought to\r\nbe 45 feet below the horizon!\r\n\r\nThe Rondö Light, also on the west coast of Norway (see p. 55), is 161\r\nfeet high, and is visible for 25 statute miles; the proper calculation\r\nwill prove that it ought to be above 130 feet below the horizon!\r\n\r\nThe Egerö Light, on west point of Island, south coast of Norway (see\r\np. 56), and which is fitted up with the first order of the dioptric\r\nlights, is visible for 28 statute miles, and the altitude above high\r\nwater is 154 feet; making the usual calculation we find this light\r\nought to be depressed, or sunk, below the horizon 230 feet!\r\n\r\nThe Dunkerque Light, on the north coast of France (see p. 71), is 194\r\nfeet high, and visible 28 statute miles. The ordinary calculation will\r\nshow that it ought to be 190 feet below the horizon!\r\n\r\nThe Goulfar Bay Light, on the west coast of France, is said at page 77,\r\nto be visible 31 statute miles, and to have an altitude at high water\r\nof 276 feet, at the distance given it ought to be 210 feet below the\r\nhorizon!\r\n\r\nAt page 78, the Cordonan Light, on the River Gironde, west coast of\r\nFrance, is given as being visible 31 statute miles, and its altitude\r\n207 feet, which would give its depression below the horizon as nearly\r\n280 feet!\r\n\r\nThe Light at Madras (p. 104), on the Esplanade, is 132 feet high, and\r\nvisible 28 statute miles, whereas at that distance it ought to be\r\nbeneath the horizon above 250 feet!\r\n\r\nThe Port Nicholson Light, in New Zealand, erected in 1859 (p. 110), is\r\nvisible 35 statute miles, the altitude is 420 feet above high water,\r\nand ought, if the water is convex, to be 220 feet below the horizon!\r\n\r\nThe Light on Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland, is 150 feet above high\r\nwater, and is visible 35 statute miles (p. 111), this will give on\r\ncalculation for the Earth’s rotundity, 491 feet that the Light should\r\nbe below the horizon!\r\n\r\nMany other cases could be given from the same work, shewing that the\r\npractical observations of mariners, engineers, and surveyors, entirely\r\nignore the doctrine that the Earth is a globe. The following cases\r\ntaken from miscellaneous sources will be interesting as bearing upon\r\nand leading to the same conclusion. In the _Illustrated London News_ of\r\nOct. 20, 1849, an engraving is given of a new Lighthouse erected on the\r\nIrish coast, The accompanying descriptive matter contains the following\r\nsentence:--“Ballycotton Island rises 170 feet above the level of the\r\nsea; the height of the Lighthouse is 60 feet including the Lantern;\r\ngiving the light an elevation of 230 feet, which is visible upwards of\r\n35 miles to sea.” If the 35 miles are nautical measure the distance in\r\nstatute measure would be over 40 miles; and allowing the usual distance\r\nfor the horizon, there would be 36 miles from thence to the Lighthouse.\r\nThe square of 36 multiplied by 8 inches amounts to 864 feet; deduct the\r\ntotal altitude of the Lantern, 230 feet, and the remainder, 634 feet,\r\nis the distance which the Light of Ballycotton ought to be below the\r\nhorizon!\r\n\r\nIn the _Times_ newspaper of Monday, Oct. 16, 1854, in an account of her\r\nMajesty’s visit to Great Grimsby from Hull, the following paragraph\r\noccurs:--“Their attention was first naturally directed to a gigantic\r\ntower which rises from the centre pier to the height of 300 feet, and\r\ncan be seen 60 miles out at sea.” The 60 miles if nautical, and this\r\nis always understood when referring to distances at sea, would make\r\n70 statute miles, to which the fall of 8 inches belongs, and as all\r\nobservations at sea are considered to be made at an elevation of 10\r\nfeet above the water, for which four miles must be deducted from the\r\nwhole distance, 66 statute miles will remain, the square of which\r\nmultiplied by 8 inches, gives a declination towards the tower of\r\n2,904 feet; deducting from this the altitude of the tower, 300 feet,\r\nwe obtain the startling conclusion that the tower should be at the\r\ndistance at which it is visible, (60 nautical miles,) more than 2,600\r\nfeet _below the horizon_!\r\n\r\nThe only modification which can be made or allowed in the preceding\r\ncalculations is that for refraction, which is considered by surveyors\r\ngenerally to amount to about ¹⁄₁₂th of the altitude of the object\r\nobserved. If we make this allowance it will reduce the various\r\nquotients by ¹⁄₁₂th, which is so little that the whole will be\r\nsubstantially the same. Take the last quotation as an instance--2,600\r\nfeet divided by 12 gives 206, which deducted from 2,600 leaves 2,384 as\r\nthe corrected amount for refraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 14.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMMARY--APPLICATION--_CUI BONO?_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding sections it has been shown that the Copernican, or\r\nNewtonian theory of Astronomy is “an absurd composition of truth and\r\nerror;” and, as admitted by its founder, “not necessarily true or\r\neven probable,” and that instead of its being a general conclusion\r\nderived from known and admitted facts, it is a heterogeneous compound\r\nof assumed premises, isolated truths, and variable appearances in\r\nnature. Its advocates are challenged to show a single instance wherein\r\na phenomenon is explained, a calculation made, or a conclusion\r\nadvanced without the aid of an avowed or implied assumption! The\r\nvery construction of a theory at all, and especially such as the\r\nCopernican, is a complete violation of that natural and legitimate mode\r\nof investigation to which the term _zetetic_ has been applied. The\r\ndoctrine of the universality of gravitation is an assumption, made only\r\nin accordance with that “pride and ambition which has led philosophers\r\nto think it beneath them to offer anything less to the world than a\r\ncomplete and finished system of nature.” It was said, in effect, by\r\nNewton, and has ever since been insisted upon by his disciples--“Allow\r\nus, without proof, the existence of two universal forces--centrifugal\r\nand centripetal, or attraction and repulsion, and we will construct\r\na system which shall explain all the leading mysteries of nature. An\r\napple falling from a tree, or a stone rolling downwards, and a pail of\r\nwater tied to a string set in rapid motion were assumed to be types of\r\nthe relations existing among all the bodies in the universe. The moon\r\nwas assumed to have a tendency to fall towards the Earth, and the Earth\r\nand Moon together towards the Sun. The same relation was assumed to\r\nexist between all the smaller and larger luminaries in the firmament;\r\nand it soon became necessary to extend this assumption to infinity. The\r\nuniverse was parcelled out into systems--co-existent and illimitable.\r\nSuns, Planets, Satellites, and Comets were assumed to exist, infinite\r\nin number and boundless in extent; and to enable the theorists to\r\nexplain the alternating and constantly recurring phenomena which\r\nwere everywhere observable, these numberless and for-ever-extending\r\nobjects were assumed to be spheres. The Earth we inhabit was called a\r\n_planet_; and because it was thought to be reasonable that the luminous\r\nobjects in the firmament which were called _planets_ were _spherical_\r\nand had _motion_, so it was only reasonable to suppose that as the\r\nEarth was a planet it must also be spherical and have motion--_ergo_,\r\nthe Earth is a globe, and moves upon axes and in an orbit round the\r\nSun! And as the Earth is a globe, and is inhabited, so again it is only\r\nreasonable to conclude that the planets are worlds like the Earth,\r\nand are inhabited by sentient beings! What reasoning! Assumption upon\r\nassumption, and the conclusion derived therefrom called a thing proved,\r\nto be employed as a truth to substantiate the first assumption! Such a\r\n“juggle and jumble” of fancies and falsehoods, extended and intensified\r\nas it is in theoretical astronomy, is calculated to make the\r\nunprejudiced inquirer revolt in horror from the terrible conjuration\r\nwhich has been practised upon him; to sternly resolve to resist its\r\nfurther progress; to endeavour to overthrow the entire edifice, and\r\nto bury in its ruins the false honours which have been associated\r\nwith its fabricators, and which still attach to its devotees. For the\r\nlearning, the patience, the perseverance, and devotion for which they\r\nhave ever been examples, honour and applause need not be withheld;\r\nbut their false reasoning, the advantages they have taken of the\r\ngeneral ignorance of mankind in respect to astronomical subjects, and\r\nthe unfounded theories they have advanced and defended, cannot but be\r\nregretted, and ought to be resisted. It has become a duty, paramount\r\nand imperative, to meet them in open, avowed, and unyielding rebellion;\r\nto declare that their unopposed reign of error and confusion is over;\r\nand that henceforth, like a falling dynasty, they must shrink and\r\ndisappear, leaving the throne and the kingdom to those awakening\r\nintellects whose numbers are constantly increasing, and whose march is\r\nrapid and irresistible. The soldiers of truth and reason have drawn the\r\nsword, and ere another generation has been educated, will have forced\r\nthe usurper to abdicate. The axe is lifted--it is falling, and in a\r\nvery few years will have “cut the cumberer down.”\r\n\r\nThe Earth a Globe, and it is necessarily demanded that it has a diurnal\r\nand an annual and various other motions; for a globular world without\r\nmotion would be useless--day and night, winter and summer, the half\r\nyear’s light and darkness at the “North Pole,” and other phenomena\r\ncould not be explained by the supposition of rotundity without the\r\nassumption also of rapid and constant motion. Hence it is _assumed_\r\nthat the Earth and Moon, and all the Planets and their Satellites\r\nmove in relation to each other, and that the whole move together in\r\ndifferent planes round the Sun. The Sun and its “system” of revolving\r\nbodies are now assumed to have a general and all-inclusive motion,\r\nin common with an endless series of other Suns and systems, around\r\nsome other and “central Sun” which has been assumed to be the true\r\naxis and centre of the Universe! These assumed general motions\r\nwith the particular and peculiar motions which are assigned to the\r\nvarious bodies in detail, together constitute a system so confused\r\nand complicated that it is almost impossible and always difficult of\r\ncomprehension by the most active and devoted minds. The most simple\r\nand direct experiments, however, may be shown to prove that the Earth\r\nhas no progressive motion whatever; and here again the advocates of\r\nthis interminable and entangling arrangement are challenged to produce\r\na single instance of so called proofs of these motions which does not\r\ninvolve an assumption--often a glaring falsehood--but always a point\r\nwhich is not, or cannot be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe magnitudes, distances, velocities, and periodic times which these\r\nassumed motions eliminate, are all glaringly fictitious, because\r\nthey are only such as a false theory creates a necessity for. It\r\nis geometrically demonstrable that all the visible luminaries in\r\nthe firmament are within a distance of a few thousand miles, not\r\nmore than the space which stretches between the North Pole and the\r\nCape of Good Hope; and the principle of measurement--that of plane\r\ntriangulation--which demonstrates this important fact, is one which no\r\nmathematician, demanding to be considered a master in the science, dare\r\nfor a moment deny. All these luminaries then, and the Sun itself, being\r\nso near to us, cannot be other than very small as compared with the\r\nEarth we inhabit. They are all in motion over the Earth, which is alone\r\nimmoveable, and therefore they cannot be anything more than secondary\r\nand subservient structures, ministering to this fixed material world,\r\nand to its inhabitants. This is a plain, simple, and in every respect\r\ndemonstrable philosophy, agreeing with the evidence of our senses,\r\nborne out by every fairly instituted experiment, and never requiring\r\na violation of those principles of investigation which the human mind\r\nhas ever recognized, and depended upon in its every day life. The\r\nmodern, or Newtonian Astronomy, has none of these characteristics. The\r\nwhole system taken together constitutes a most monstrous absurdity. It\r\nis false in its foundation; irregular, unfair, and illogical in its\r\ndetails; and in its conclusions inconsistent and contradictory. Worse\r\nthan all, it is a prolific source of irreligion and of atheism, of\r\nwhich its advocates are, practically, supporters! By defending a system\r\nwhich is directly opposite to that which is taught in connection with\r\nall religions, they lead the more critical and daring intellects to\r\nreject the scriptures altogether, to ignore the worship, and doubt and\r\ndeny the existence of a Supreme Ruler of the world. Many of the primest\r\nminds are thus irreparably injured, robbed of those present pleasures,\r\nand that cheering hope of the future which the earnest christian\r\ndevotee holds as of far greater value than all earthly wealth and\r\ngrandeur; or than the mastery of all the philosophical complications\r\nwhich the human mind ever invented.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity and motion is now shown to be\r\nunconditionally false; and therefore the scriptures which assert the\r\ncontrary, are, in their philosophical teachings at least, _literally\r\ntrue_. In practical science therefore, atheism and denial of scriptural\r\nauthority have no foundation. If human theories are cast aside, and\r\nthe facts of nature, and legitimate reasoning alone depended upon, it\r\nwill be seen that religion and true philosophy are not antagonistic,\r\nand that the hopes which both encourage may be fully relied upon. To\r\nthe religious mind this matter is most important, it is indeed no\r\nless than a sacred question, for it renders complete the evidence\r\nthat the Jewish and Christian scriptures are true, and must have been\r\ncommunicated to mankind by an anterior and supernal Being. For if after\r\nso many ages of mental struggling, of speculation and trial, and change\r\nand counterchange, we have at length discovered that all astronomical\r\ntheories are false, that the Earth is a plane, and motionless, and that\r\nthe various luminaries above it are lights only and not worlds; and\r\nthat these very doctrines have been taught and recorded in a work which\r\nhas been handed down to us from the earliest times; from a time, in\r\nfact, when mankind could not have had sufficient experience to enable\r\nthem to criticise and doubt, much less to invent, it follows that\r\nwhoever dictated and caused such doctrines to be recorded and preserved\r\nto all future generations, must have been superhuman, omniscient, and,\r\nto the Earth and its inhabitants pre-existent.\r\n\r\nTo the dogged Atheist, whose “mind is made up” not to enter into any\r\nfurther investigation, and not to admit of possible error in his past\r\nconclusions, this question is of no more account than it is to an Ox.\r\nHe who cares not to re-examine from time to time his state of mind,\r\nand the result of his accumulated experience is in no single respect\r\nbetter than the lowest animal in creation. He may see nothing higher,\r\nmore noble, more intelligent or beautiful than himself; and in this\r\nhis pride, conceit, and vanity find an incarnation. To such a creature\r\nthere is no God, for he is himself an equal with the highest being he\r\nhas ever recognised! Such Atheism exists to an alarming extent among\r\nthe philosophers of Europe and America; and it has been mainly fostered\r\nby the astronomical and geological theories of the day. Besides which,\r\nin consequence of the differences between the language of Scripture and\r\nthe teachings of modern Astronomy, there is to be found in the very\r\nhearts of Christian and Jewish congregations a sort of “smouldering\r\nscepticism;” kind of faint suspicion which causes great numbers to\r\nmanifest a cold and visible indifference to religious requirements.\r\nIt is this which has led thousands to desert the cause of earnest,\r\nactive Christianity, and which has forced the majority of those who\r\nstill remain in the ranks of religion to declare “that the Scriptures\r\nwere not intended to teach correctly other than moral and religious\r\ndoctrines; that the references so often made to the physical world,\r\nand to natural phenomena generally, are given in language to suit\r\nthe prevailing notions and the ignorance of the people.” A Christian\r\nphilosopher who wrote almost a century ago in reference to remarks\r\nsimilar to the above, says, “Why should we suspect that Moses, Joshua,\r\nDavid, Solomon, and the later prophets and inspired writers have\r\ncounterfeited their sentiments concerning the order of the universe,\r\nfrom pure complaisance, or being in any way obliged to dissemble with a\r\nview to gratify the prepossessions of the populace? These eminent men\r\nbeing kings, lawgivers, and generals themselves, or always privileged\r\nwith access to the courts of sovereign princes, besides the reverence\r\nand awful dignity which the power of divination and working of miracles\r\nprocured to them, had great worldly and spiritual authority....\r\nThey had often in charge to command, suspend, revert, and otherwise\r\ninterfere with the course and laws of nature, and were never daunted\r\nto speak out the truth before the most mighty potentates on earth,\r\nmuch less would they be overawed by the _vox populi_.” To say that\r\nthe Scriptures were not intended to teach science truthfully, is in\r\nsubstance to declare that God himself has stated, and commissioned\r\nHis prophets to teach things which are utterly false! Those Newtonian\r\nphilosophers who still hold that the sacred volume is the Word of God,\r\nare thus placed in a fearful dilemma. How can the two systems, so\r\ndirectly opposite in character, be reconciled? Oil and water alone will\r\nnot combine--mix them by violence as we may, they will again separate\r\nwhen allowed to rest. Call oil oil, and water water, and acknowledge\r\nthem to be distinct in nature and value; but let no “hodge-podge” be\r\nattempted, and passed off as a genuine compound of oil and water.\r\nCall Scripture the Word of God--the Creator and Ruler of all things,\r\nand the Fountain of all Truth; and call the Newtonian or Copernican\r\nAstronomy the word and work of man, of man, too, in his vainest\r\nmood--so vain and conceited as not to be content with the direct and\r\nsimple teachings of his Maker, but who must rise up in rebellion and\r\nconjure into existence a fanciful complicated fabric, which being\r\ninsisted upon as true, creates and necessitates the dark and horrible\r\ninterrogatives--Is God a deceiver? Has He spoken direct and unequivocal\r\nfalsehood? Can we no longer indulge in the beautiful and consoling\r\nthought that God’s justice, and love, and truth are unchanging and\r\nreliable for ever? Let Christians--for Sceptics and Atheists may be\r\nleft out of the question--to whatever division of the Church they\r\nbelong, look at this matter calmly and earnestly. Let them determine\r\nto uproot the deception which has led them to think that they can\r\naltogether ignore the plainest astronomical teaching of Scripture, and\r\nendorse a system to which it is in every sense opposed. The following\r\nlanguage is quoted as an instance of the manner in which the doctrine\r\nof the Earth’s rotundity and the plurality of worlds interferes with\r\nScriptural teachings:--“The theory of original sin is confuted (by\r\nour astronomical and geological knowledge), and I cannot permit the\r\nbelief, when I know that our world is but a mere speck, a perishable\r\natom in the vast space of creation, that God should just select this\r\nlittle spot to descend upon and assume our form, and clothe Himself in\r\nour flesh, to become visible to human eyes, to the tiny beings of this\r\ncomparatively insignificant world.... Thus millions of distant worlds,\r\nwith the beings allotted to them, were to be extirpated and destroyed\r\nin consequence of the original sin of Adam. No sentiment of the human\r\nmind can surely be more derogatory to the Divine attributes of the\r\nCreator, nor more repugnant to the known economy of the celestial\r\nbodies. For in the first place, who is to say, among the infinity\r\nof worlds, whether Adam was the _only creature_ who was tempted by\r\nSatan and fell, and by his fall involved all the other worlds in his\r\nguilt.”[42]\r\n\r\n  [42] Encyclopædia Londenensis, p. 457, vol. 2.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty experienced by the author of the above remarks is\r\nclearly one which can no longer exist, when it is seen that the\r\ndoctrine of a plurality of worlds is an impossibility. That it is an\r\nimpossibility is shown by the fact that the Sun, Moon, and Stars are\r\nvery small bodies, and very near to the earth; this fact is proved by\r\nactual non-theoretical measurement; this measurement is made on the\r\nprinciple of plane trigonometry: this principle of plane trigonometry\r\nis adopted because the Earth is a Plane; and all the base lines\r\nemployed in the triangulation are horizontal. By the same practical\r\nmethod of reasoning, all the difficulties which, upon geological and\r\nastronomical grounds, have been raised to the literal teachings of the\r\nscriptures, may be completely destroyed. Instances:--The scriptures\r\nrepeatedly declare that the Sun moves over the Earth--“His going forth\r\nis from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it.”\r\n“He ariseth and goeth down, and hasteth to his place whence he arose.”\r\n“The sun stood still in the midst of heaven.” “Great is the Earth, high\r\nis the heaven, swift is the Sun in his course.” In the religious poems\r\nof all ages the same fact is presented. Christians especially, of every\r\ndenomination, are familiar with, and often read and sing with delight\r\nsuch poetry as the following:--\r\n\r\n    “My God who makes the Sun to know\r\n    His proper hour to rise,\r\n    And to give light to all below\r\n    Doth send him _round the skies_.”\r\n\r\n    “When from the chambers of the east\r\n    His _morning race_ begins,\r\n    He never tires _nor stops to rest_,\r\n    But round the world he shines.”\r\n\r\n    “God of the morning, at whose voice,\r\n    The cheerful sun makes haste to rise,\r\n    And, like a giant, doth rejoice,\r\n    To _run his journey through the skies_.”\r\n\r\n    “He sends the sun _his circuit round_,\r\n    To cheer the fruits and warm the ground.”\r\n\r\n    “How fair has the day been!\r\n    How bright was the Sun!\r\n    How lovely and joyful\r\n    The _course that he run_.”\r\n\r\nAll the expressions of scripture are consistent with the fact of the\r\nSun’s motion. They never declare anything to the contrary. Whenever\r\nthey speak of the subject it is in the same manner. The direct evidence\r\nof our senses confirms it; and actual and special observations, as well\r\nas the most practical scientific experiments, declare the same thing.\r\nThe progressive and concentric motion of the Sun over the Earth is in\r\nevery sense demonstrable; yet the Newtonian astronomers insist upon\r\nit that the Sun does not really move, that it only _appears_ to move,\r\nand that this appearance arises from the motion of the Earth; that\r\nwhen, as the scriptures affirm, the “Sun stood still in the midst of\r\nheaven,” it was the _Earth_ which stood still and _not_ the Sun! that\r\nthe scriptures therefore speak falsely, and the experiments of science,\r\nand the observations and applications of our senses are never to be\r\nrelied upon. Whence comes this bold and arrogant denial of the value of\r\nour senses and judgement, and the authority of scripture? The Earth\r\nor the Sun moves. Our senses tell us, and the scriptures declare that\r\nthe Earth is fixed and that it is the Sun which moves above and around\r\nit; but a _theory_, which is absolutely false in its groundwork, and\r\nridiculously illogical in its details, demands that the Earth is round\r\nand moves upon axes, and in several other and various directions; and\r\nthat these motions are _sufficient to account for_ certain phenomena\r\nwithout supposing that the Sun moves, _therefore_ the Sun is a fixed\r\nbody, and his motion is _only apparent_! Such _reasoning_ is a disgrace\r\nto philosophy, and fearfully dangerous to the religious interests of\r\nhumanity!\r\n\r\nChristian ministers and commentators find it a most unwelcome task\r\nwhen called upon to reconcile the plain and simple philosophy of the\r\nscriptures with the monstrous teachings of theoretical astronomy.\r\nDr. Adam Clark, in a letter to the Rev. Thomas Roberts, of Bath,[43]\r\nspeaking of the progress of his commentary, and of his endeavours\r\nto reconcile the statements of scripture with the modern astronomy,\r\nsays: “Joshua’s Sun and Moon standing still, have kept me going for\r\nnearly three weeks! That one chapter has afforded me more vexation\r\nthan anything I have ever met with; and even now I am but about half\r\nsatisfied with my own solution of all the difficulties, though I am\r\nconfident that I have removed mountains that were never touched before;\r\nshall I say that I am heartily weary of my work, so weary that I have\r\na thousand times wished I had never written one page of it, and am\r\nrepeatedly purposing to give it up.”\r\n\r\n  [43] Life of Adam Clark, 8vo Edition.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Wesley, in his journal, writes as follows:--“The more I\r\nconsider them the more I doubt of all systems of astronomy. I doubt\r\nwhether we can with certainty know either the distance or magnitude of\r\nany star in the firmament; else why do astronomers so immensely differ,\r\neven with regard to the distance of the Sun from the Earth? Some\r\naffirming it to be only three and others ninety millions of miles.”[44]\r\n\r\n  [44] Extracts from works of Rev. J. Wesley, 3rd Edition, 1829.\r\n  Published by Mason, London, p. 392, vol. 2.\r\n\r\nIn vol. 3, page 203, the following entry occurs:--“January 1st,\r\n1765.--This week I wrote an answer to a warm letter published in the\r\n_London Magazine_, the author whereof is much displeased that I presume\r\nto doubt of the ‘modern astronomy.’ I cannot help it. Nay, the more\r\nI consider the more my doubts increase; so that at present I doubt\r\nwhether any man on earth knows either the distance or magnitude, I\r\nwill not say of a fixed Star, but Saturn or Jupiter--yea of the Sun or\r\nMoon.”\r\n\r\nIn vol. 13, page 359, he says:--“And so the whole hypothesis of\r\ninnumerable Suns and worlds moving round them vanishes into air.” And\r\nagain at page 430 of same volume, the following words occur:--“The\r\nplanets revolutions we are acquainted with, but who is able to this\r\nday, regularly to demonstrate either their magnitude or their distance?\r\nUnless he will prove, as is the usual way, the magnitude from the\r\ndistance, and the distance from the magnitude. * * * Dr. Rogers has\r\nevidently demonstrated that no conjunction of the centrifugal and\r\ncentripetal forces can possibly account for this, or even cause any\r\nbody to move in an ellipsis.” There are several other incidental\r\nremarks to be found in his writings which shew that the Rev. John\r\nWesley was well acquainted with the then modern astronomy; and that\r\nhe saw clearly both its self-contradictory and its anti-scriptural\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt is a very popular idea among modern astronomers that the stellar\r\nuniverse is an endless congeries of systems, of Suns and attendant\r\nworlds peopled with sentient beings analogous in the purpose and\r\ndestiny of their existence to the inhabitants of this earth. This\r\ndoctrine of a plurality of worlds, although it conveys the most\r\nmagnificent ideas of the universe, is purely fanciful, and may be\r\ncompared to the “dreams of the alchemists” who laboured with unheard\r\nof enthusiasm to discover the “philosopher’s stone,” the _elixir vitæ_,\r\nand the “universal solvent.” However grand the first two projects\r\nmight have been in their realisation, it is known that they were never\r\ndeveloped in a practical sense, and the latter idea of a solvent which\r\nwould dissolve everything was suddenly and unexpectedly destroyed by\r\nthe few remarks of a simple but critical observer, who demanded to\r\nknow what service a substance would be to them which would dissolve\r\nall things? What could they keep it in? for it would dissolve every\r\nvessel wherein they sought to preserve it! This idea of a plurality\r\nof worlds is but a natural and reasonable conclusion drawn from the\r\ndoctrine of the Earth’s rotundity. But this doctrine being false its\r\noff shoot is equally so. The supposition that the heavenly bodies are\r\nSuns and inhabited worlds is demonstrably impossible in nature, and\r\nhas no foundation whatever in Scripture. “In the beginning God created\r\nthe Heaven and _the Earth_.” One Earth _only_ is created; and the fact\r\nis more especially described in Genesis, ch. i., v. 10. Where, instead\r\nof the word “Earth” meaning both land and water as together forming a\r\nglobe, as it does in the Newtonian astronomy, only the _dry land_ was\r\ncalled _earth_,” and “the gathering together of the waters called He\r\nseas.” The Sun, Moon, and Stars are described as lights only and not\r\nworlds. A great number of passages might be quoted which prove that no\r\nother material world is ever in the slightest manner referred to by the\r\nsacred writers. The creation of the world; the origin of evil, and the\r\nfall of man; the plan of redemption by the death of Christ; the day\r\nof judgement, and the final consummation of all things are invariably\r\nassociated with _this Earth alone_. The expression in Hebrews, ch. i.,\r\nv. 2, “by whom also he made the _worlds_,” and in Heb., ch. ii., v.\r\n3, “through faith we understand that the _worlds_ were framed,” are\r\nknown to be a comparatively recent rendering from the original Greek\r\ndocuments. The word which has been translated _worlds_ is fully as\r\ncapable of being rendered in the singular number as the plural; and\r\nprevious to the introduction of the Copernican Astronomy was always\r\ntranslated “_the world_.” The Roman Catholic and the French Protestant\r\nBibles still contain the singular number; and in a copy of an English\r\nProtestant Bible printed in the year 1608, the following translation is\r\ngiven:--“Through faith we understand that _the world_ was ordained.”\r\nSo that either the plural expression “worlds” was used in later\r\ntranslations to accord with the astronomical notions then recently\r\nintroduced, or it was meant to include the Earth and the spiritual\r\nworld, as referred to in:--\r\n\r\n_Hebrews_ ii., 5--“For unto angels hath he not put into subjection _the\r\nworld to come_.”\r\n\r\n_Ephesians_ i., 21--“Far above all principality and power, and might,\r\nand dominion, and every name that is named not only in _this world_,\r\nbut also in _that which is to come_.”\r\n\r\n_Luke_ xviii., 29, 30--“There is no man that hath left house, or\r\nparents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s\r\nsake, who shall not receive manifold more in this _present time_, and\r\nin _the world to come_ life everlasting.”\r\n\r\n_Matthew_ xii., 32--“Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it\r\nshall not be forgiven him, neither in _this world_ neither in the\r\n_world to come_.”\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures teach that in the day of the Lord “the Heavens shall\r\npass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent\r\nheat,” and the “stars of Heaven fall unto the Earth even as a fig tree\r\ncasteth her untimely figs when shaken of a mighty wind.” The Newtonian\r\nsystem of astronomy declares that the stars and planets are mighty\r\nworlds--nearly all of them much larger than this Earth. The fixed\r\nstars are considered to be suns, equal to if not greater than our own\r\nsun, which is said to be above 800,000 miles in diameter. All this is\r\nproveably false, but to those who have been led to believe it, the\r\ndifficult question arises,--“How can thousands of stars fall upon\r\nthe Earth, which is many times less than any one of them?” How can\r\nthe Earth with a supposed diameter of 8000 miles receive the numerous\r\nsuns of the firmament many of which are said to be a million miles in\r\ndiameter?\r\n\r\nThese stars are assumed to have positions so far from the Earth that\r\nthe distance is almost inexpressible; figures indeed may be arranged on\r\npaper but in reading them no practical idea is conveyed to the mind.\r\nMany of them are said to be so distant that should they fall with the\r\nvelocity of light or above one hundred and sixty thousand miles in a\r\nsecond, or six hundred millions of miles per hour, they would require\r\nnearly two millions of years to reach the Earth! Sir William Herschel\r\nin a paper on “The power of telescopes to penetrate into space,”\r\npublished in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for the year 1800,\r\naffirms, that with his powerful instruments he discovered brilliant\r\nluminaries so far from the Earth that the light from them “could not\r\nhave been less than _one million nine hundred thousand years in its\r\nprogress_.” Again the difficulty presents itself--“If the stars of\r\nHeaven begin to fall to-day, and with the greatest imaginable velocity,\r\nmillions of years must elapse before they reach the Earth!” But the\r\nScriptures declare that these changes shall occur suddenly--shall\r\ncome, indeed, “as a thief in the night.”\r\n\r\nThe same theory, with its false and inconceivable distances and\r\nmagnitudes, operates to destroy all the ordinary, common sense, and\r\nscripturally authorised chronology. Christian and Jewish commentators,\r\nunless astronomically educated, hold and teach that the Earth, as well\r\nas the Sun, Moon, and Stars, were created about 4,000 years before the\r\nbirth of Christ, or less than 6,000 years before the present time.\r\nBut if many of these luminaries are so distant that their light would\r\nrequire above a million of years to reach us; and if, as we are taught,\r\nbodies are visible to us because of the light which they reflect or\r\nradiate, then their light _has_ reached us, because we have been able\r\nto see them, and therefore they must have been shining, and must have\r\nbeen created at least _one million nine hundred thousand years ago_!\r\nThe chronology of the bible indicates that a period of six thousand\r\nyears has not yet elapsed since “the Heavens and the Earth were\r\nfinished, and _all_ the Host of them.”\r\n\r\nIn the modern astronomy, Continents, Oceans, Seas, and Islands, are\r\nconsidered as together forming one vast Globe of 25,000 miles in\r\ncircumference. This has been shown to be fallacious, and it is clearly\r\ncontrary to the plain, literal teaching of the scriptures. In the first\r\nchapter of Genesis, we find the following language: “and God said let\r\nthe waters under the heaven be gathered unto one place, and let the\r\n_dry land_ appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land _Earth_,\r\nand the gathering together of the waters called He Seas.” Here the\r\nEarth and Seas--Earth and the great body of waters, are described as\r\ntwo distinct and independent regions, and not as together forming one\r\nGlobe which astronomers call “the Earth.” This description is confirmed\r\nby several other passages of scripture.\r\n\r\n2 _Peter_, iii., 5--“For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by\r\nthe Word of God the Heavens were of old, and the Earth _standing out of\r\nthe waters and in the waters_.”\r\n\r\n_Psalms_ cxxxvi., 6--“O give thanks to the Lord of Lords, that by\r\nwisdom made the heavens, and that _stretchet out the earth above the\r\nwaters_.”\r\n\r\n_Psalms_ xxiv., 1, 2--“The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof;\r\nthe world and they that dwell therein: for he hath _founded it upon the\r\nseas, and established it upon the floods_.”\r\n\r\n_Hermes_ (New Testament Apocrypha)--“Who with the word of his strength\r\nfixed the heaven; and _founded the earth upon the waters_.”\r\n\r\n_Job_ xxvi., 7--“He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and\r\nhangeth the Earth upon nothing.”\r\n\r\nSome think that the latter part of this verse, “hangeth the Earth upon\r\nnothing,” favours the idea that the Earth is a globe revolving in\r\nspace without visible support; but Dr. Adam Clark, although himself a\r\nNewtonian philosopher, says, in his commentary upon this passage in\r\nJob, the literal translation is, “on the hollow or empty waste,” and\r\nhe quotes a Chaldee version of the passage which runs as follows: “He\r\nlayeth the Earth upon the waters nothing sustaining it.”\r\n\r\nIt is not that He “hangeth the Earth upon nothing,” but “hangeth\r\nor layeth it upon the waters” which were empty or waste, and where\r\nbefore there was nothing. This is in strict accordance with the other\r\nexpressions, that “the Earth was founded upon the waters,” &c., and\r\nalso with the expression in Genesis, “that the face of the deep was\r\ncovered only with darkness.”\r\n\r\nIf the Earth were a globe, it is evident that everywhere the water of\r\nits surface, the seas, lakes, oceans, and rivers, must be sustained the\r\nland, the Earth must be under the water; but if the land and the waters\r\nare distinct, and the Earth is “founded upon the seas,” then everywhere\r\nthe sea must sustain the land as it does a ship or any other floating\r\nmass, and there is water below the earth. In this particular as in all\r\nthe others, the scriptures are beautifully sequential and consistent:--\r\n\r\n_Exodus_ xx, 4--“Thou shalt not make unto thee any likeness of anything\r\nin heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the _waters under the\r\nEarth_.”\r\n\r\n_Genesis_ xliv, 25--“The Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings\r\nof heaven above, and blessings of the _deep that lieth under_.”\r\n\r\n_Deut._ xxxiii, 13--“Blessed be his land, for the precious things of\r\nheaven; for the dew; and for the _deep which couched beneath_.”\r\n\r\n_Deut._ iv, 18--“Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves, and make\r\nno similitude of anything on the Earth, or the likeness of anything\r\nthat is in the _waters beneath the Earth_.”\r\n\r\nThe same idea prevailed among the ancients generally. In Ovid’s\r\nMetamorphoses, Jupiter, in an assembly of the gods, is made to say, “I\r\nswear by the infernal _waves which glide under the Earth_.”\r\n\r\nIf the earth is a distinct structure standing in and upon the waters\r\nof the “great deep,” it follows that, unless it can be shown that\r\nsomething else sustains the waters, that the depth is fathomless. As\r\nthere is no evidence whatever of anything existing underneath the\r\n“great deep,” and as in many parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\r\nno bottom has been found by the most scientific and efficient means\r\nwhich human ingenuity could invent, we are forced to the conclusion\r\nthat the depth is boundless. This conclusion is again confirmed by the\r\nscriptures.\r\n\r\n_Jeremiah_ xxxi, 37--“Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a\r\nlight by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a\r\nlight by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar, the\r\nLord of Hosts is His name. If these ordinances depart from before me,\r\nsaith the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a\r\nnation before me for ever. Thus saith the Lord: if heaven above can be\r\nmeasured, and the _foundations_ of the _Earth searched out beneath_, I\r\nwill also cast off all the seed of Israel.”\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen that God’s promises to his people could\r\nno more be broken than could the height of heaven, or the depths of the\r\nEarth’s foundations be searched out. The fathomless deep beneath--upon\r\nwhich the Earth is founded, and the infinitude of heaven above, are\r\nhere given as emblems of the boundlessness of God’s power, and of\r\nthe certainty that all his ordinances will be fulfilled. When God’s\r\npower can be limited, heaven above will no longer be infinite; and\r\nthe mighty waters, the foundations of the earth may be fathomed. But\r\nthe scriptures plainly teach us that the power and wisdom of God, the\r\nheights of Heaven, and the depths of the waters under the Earth are\r\nalike unfathomable; and no true philosophy ever avers, nor ever did nor\r\never can aver, a single fact to the contrary.\r\n\r\nIn all the religions of the Earth the words “up” and “above” are\r\nassociated with a region of peace and happiness. Heaven is always\r\nspoken of as _above_ the _Earth_. The scriptures invariable convey the\r\nsame idea:--\r\n\r\n_Deut._ xxvi., 15--“Look _down_ from Thy holy habitation, from Heaven,\r\nand bless Thy people Israel.”\r\n\r\n_Exodus_ xix., 20--“And the Lord came _down_ upon Mount Sinai.”\r\n\r\n_Psalm_ cii., 19--“For he hath looked _down_ from the height of his\r\nsanctuary: from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth.”\r\n\r\n_Isaiah_ lxiii., 15--“Look _down_ from Heaven, and behold from the\r\nhabitation of Thy holiness and of Thy glory.”\r\n\r\n_Psalm_ ciii., 11--“For as the Heaven is high _above the Earth_.”\r\n\r\n2 _Kings_ ii., 11--“And Elijah went _up_ by a whirlwind into Heaven.”\r\n\r\n_Mark_ xvi., 10--“So then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was\r\nreceived _up into Heaven_.”\r\n\r\n_Luke_ xxiv., 51--“And it came to pass, while He blessed them, He was\r\nparted from them, and carried _up into Heaven_.”\r\n\r\nIf the Earth is a globe revolving at the rate of above a thousand miles\r\nan hour all this language of scripture is necessarily fallacious. The\r\nterms “up” and “down,” and “above” and “below,” are words without\r\nmeaning, at best are merely relative--indicative of no absolute\r\nor certain direction. That which is “up” at noon-day, is directly\r\n“down” at midnight. Heaven can only be spoken of as “above,” and the\r\nscriptures can only be read correctly for a single moment out of the\r\ntwenty-four hours; for before the sentence “Heaven is high above the\r\nEarth” could be uttered, the speaker would be descending from the\r\nmeridian where Heaven was above him, and his eye although unmoved would\r\nbe fixed upon a point millions of miles away from his first position.\r\nHence in all the ceremonials of religion, where the hands and eyes\r\nare raised upwards to Heaven, nay when Christ himself “lifted up his\r\neyes to Heaven and said, Father, the hour is come,” his gaze would\r\nbe sweeping along the firmament at rapidly varying angles, and with\r\nsuch incomprehensible velocity that a fixed point of observation, and\r\na definite position, as indicating the seat or throne of “Him that\r\nsitteth in the Heavens” would be an impossibility.\r\n\r\nAgain: the religious world have always believed and meditated upon the\r\nword “Heaven” as representing an infinite region of joy and safety,\r\nof rest and happiness unspeakable; as “the place of God’s residence,\r\nthe dwelling place of angels and the blessed; the true palace of\r\nGod, entirely separated from the impurities and imperfections, the\r\nalterations and changes of the lower world; where He reigns in eternal\r\npeace. * * It is the sacred mansion of light, and joy, and glory.[45]”\r\nBut if there is a plurality of worlds, millions upon millions, nay,\r\nan “infinity of worlds,” if the universe is filled with innumerable\r\nsystems of burning suns, and rapidly revolving planets, intermingled\r\nwith rushing comets and whirling satellites, all dashing and sweeping\r\nthrough space in directions, and with velocities surpassing all human\r\ncomprehension, and terrible even to contemplate, where is the place of\r\nrest and safety? Where is the true and unchangeable “palace of God?” In\r\nwhat direction is Heaven to be found? Where is the liberated human soul\r\nto find its home--its refuge from change and motion, from uncertainty\r\nand danger? Is it to wander for ever in a labyrinth of rolling worlds?\r\nTo struggle for ever in a never ending maze of revolving suns and\r\nsystems? To be never at rest, but for ever seeking to avoid some\r\nvortex of attraction--some whirlpool of gravitation? The belief in\r\nthe existence of Heaven, as a region of peace and harmony “extending\r\n(above the Earth) through all extent,” and beyond the influence of\r\nnatural laws and restless elements, is jeopardised, if not destroyed,\r\nby a false and usurping astronomy, which has no better foundation\r\nthan human conceit and presumption. If this ill-founded, unsupported\r\nphilosophy is admitted by the religious mind, it can no longer say\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n    “Far above the sun, and stars, and skies,\r\n    In realms of endless light and love,\r\n    My Father’s mansion lies.”\r\n\r\n  [45] Cruden’s Concordance, article “Heaven.”\r\n\r\nThe modern theoretical astronomy affirms that the Moon is a solid\r\nopaque, non-luminous body; that it is, in fact, nothing less than a\r\nmaterial world. It has even been mapped out into continents, islands,\r\nseas, lakes, volcanoes, &c., &c. The nature of its atmosphere and\r\ncharacter of its productions and possible inhabitants have been\r\ndiscussed with as much freedom as though our philosophers were quite as\r\nfamiliar with it as they are with the different objects and localities\r\nupon Earth. The light, too, with which the Moon so beautifully\r\nilluminates the firmament is declared to be only borrowed--to be\r\nonly the light of the Sun intercepted and reflected upon the Earth.\r\nThese doctrines are not only opposed by a formidable array of\r\nwell-ascertained facts (as given in previous sections), but they are\r\ntotally denied by the scriptures. The Sun and Moon and Stars are never\r\nreferred to as worlds, but simply as _lights_ to rule alternately in\r\nthe firmament.\r\n\r\n_Genesis_ i., 14, 16--“And God said let there be _lights_ in the\r\nfirmament of the Heaven to divide the day from the night. * * * And God\r\nmade two _great lights_--the greater light to rule the day, and the\r\nlesser light to rule the night.”\r\n\r\n_Psalm_ cxxxvi., 7, 9--“O give thanks to Him that made _great lights_:\r\nthe Sun to rule by day, the Moon and Stars to rule by night.”\r\n\r\n_Jeremiah_, xxxi., 35--“The Sun is given for a light by day, and the\r\nordinances of the Moon and of the Stars for a light by night.”\r\n\r\n_Ezekiel_, xxxii., 7, 8--“I will cover the Sun with a cloud; and the\r\nMoon shall not give _her light_.” “All the bright lights of Heaven will\r\nI make dark over thee.”\r\n\r\n_Psalm_ cxlviii., 3--“Praise him Sun and Moon, praise him all ye Stars\r\nof light.”\r\n\r\n_Isaiah_ xiii., 10--“The Sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and\r\nthe Moon shall not cause _her_ light to shine.”\r\n\r\n_Matthew_ xxiv., 29--“Immediately after the tribulation of those days\r\nshall the Sun be darkened, and the Moon shall not give her light.”\r\n\r\n_Isaiah_ ix., 19, 20--“The Sun shall be no more thy light by day;\r\nneither for brightness shall the _Moon give light_ unto thee. * * Thy\r\nSun shall no more go down; neither shall thy Moon withdraw itself.”\r\n\r\n_Psalm_ cxxxvi., 7 to 9--“To him that made great lights, the Sun to\r\nrule by day, the Moon and Stars to rule by night.”\r\n\r\n_Job_ xxv., 5--“Behold even to the Moon, and _it_ shineth not.”\r\n\r\n_Ecclesiastes_ xii., 2--“While the Sun, or the light, or the Moon, or\r\nthe Stars be not darkened.”\r\n\r\n_Isaiah_ xxx., 26--“The light of the Moon shall be as the light of the\r\nSun; and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold.”\r\n\r\n_Deuteronomy_ xxxiii., 14--“And for the precious fruits brought forth\r\nby the Sun, and for the precious things put forth by the Moon.”\r\n\r\nIn the very first of the passages above quoted the doctrine is\r\nenunciated that various distinct and independent _lights_ were created.\r\nBut that two _great_ lights were specially called into existence for\r\nthe purpose of ruling the day and the night. The Sun and the Moon are\r\ndeclared to be these great and alternately ruling lights. Nothing is\r\nhere said, nor is it in any other part of scripture said, that the\r\nSun is a great light, and that the Moon shines only by reflection.\r\nThe Sun is called the “greater light to rule the day,” and the Moon\r\nthe “lesser light to rule the night.” Although of these two “great\r\nlights” one is less than the other, each is declared to shine with\r\nits own light. Hence in Deuteronomy, c. 33, v. 14, it is affirmed that\r\ncertain fruits are specially brought forth by the influence of the\r\nSun’s light, and that certain other productions are “put forth by the\r\nMoon.” That the light of the sun is influential in encouraging the\r\ngrowth of certain natural products; and that the light of the Moon has\r\na distinct influence in promoting the increase of certain other natural\r\nsubstances, is a matter well known to those who are familiar with\r\nhorticultural and agricultural phenomena; and it is abundantly proved\r\nby chemical evidence that the two lights are distinct in character\r\nand in action upon various elements. This distinction is beautifully\r\npreserved throughout the sacred scriptures. In no single instance are\r\nthe two lights confounded. On the contrary, in the New Testament, St.\r\nPaul affirms with authority, that “there is one glory of the Sun, and\r\nanother glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars.”\r\n\r\nThe same fact of the difference in the two lights, and their\r\nindependence of each other is maintained in the scriptures to the last.\r\n“The Sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the Moon became as\r\nblood.” If the Moon is only a reflector, the moment the Sun becomes\r\nblack her surface will be blackened also, and not remain as blood,\r\nwhile the Sun is dark and black as sackcloth of hair!\r\n\r\nAgain: the modern system of astronomy teaches that this earth cannot\r\npossibly receive light from the Stars, because of their supposed great\r\ndistance from it: that the fixed Stars are only burning spheres, or\r\nSun’s to their own systems of planets and satellites: and that their\r\nlight terminates, or no longer produces an active luminosity at the\r\ndistance of nearly two thousand millions of miles. Here again the\r\nscriptures affirm the contrary doctrine.\r\n\r\n_Genesis_ i., 16-17--“He made the Stars also; and God set them in the\r\nfirmament _to give light upon the earth_.”\r\n\r\n_Isaiah_ xiii., 10--“For the Stars of Heaven and the constellations\r\nthereof shall not _give their light_.”\r\n\r\n_Ezekiel_ xxxii., 7--“I will cover the Heaven, and make the _Stars_\r\nthereof _dark_.”\r\n\r\n_Joel_ ii., 10--“The Sun and the Moon shall be dark, and the _Stars_\r\nshall withdraw _their shining_.”\r\n\r\n_Psalm_ cxlviii., 3--“Praise him Sun and Moon: promise him all ye\r\n_Stars of Light_.”\r\n\r\n_Jeremiah_ xxxi., 35--“Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a\r\nlight by day; and the ordinances of the Moon and of _the Stars_ for a\r\n_light by night_.”\r\n\r\n_Daniel_ xii., 3--“They that turn many to righteousness shall _shine_\r\nas the _Stars_ for ever and ever.”\r\n\r\nThese quotations place it beyond doubt that the Stars were made\r\nexpressly to shine in the firmament, and “to give light upon the\r\nEarth.” In addition to this language of scripture, we have the evidence\r\nof our own eyes that the Stars give abundant light. “What beautiful\r\nstar-light!” is a common expression: and we all remember the difference\r\nbetween a dark and starless night, and one when the firmament is as it\r\nwere studded with brilliant luminaries. Travellers inform us that in\r\nmany parts of the world, where the sky is clear and free from clouds\r\nand vapours for weeks together, the Stars appear both larger and\r\nbrighter than they do in England; and that their light is sufficiently\r\nintense to enable them to read and write, and to travel with safety\r\nthrough the most dangerous places.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the Stars and the Planets are not simply lights, as\r\nthe scriptures affirm them to be, but magnificent worlds, for the most\r\npart much larger than this earth, then it is a very proper question\r\nto ask--“are they inhabited?” If the answer be in the affirmative, it\r\nis equally proper to inquire “have the first parents in each world\r\nbeen tempted?” If so, “have they fallen?” if so, “Have they required\r\nredemption?” And “have they been redeemed?” “Has each world had a\r\nseparate Redeemer? or has Christ been the Redeemer for every world in\r\nthe universe?” And if so, “did His suffering and crucifixion on this\r\nEarth suffice for the redemption of the fallen inhabitants of all other\r\nworlds? Or had He to suffer and die in each world successively? Did\r\nthe fall of Adam in this world involve in his guilt the inhabitants of\r\nall other worlds? Or was the baneful influence of Satan confined to\r\nthe first parents of this Earth? If so, why so? and if not, why not?\r\nBut, and if, and why, and again--but it is useless thus to ponder! The\r\nChristian philosopher must be confounded! If his religion be to him a\r\nliving reality, he will turn with loathing or spurn with indignation\r\nand disgust, as he would a poisonous reptile, a system of astronomy\r\nwhich creates in his mind so much confusion and uncertainty! But as the\r\nsystem which necessitates such doubts and difficulties has been shown\r\nto be purely theoretical; and to have not the slightest foundation in\r\nfact, the religious mind has really no cause for apprehension. Not a\r\nshadow of doubt remains that this World is the only one created; that\r\nthe sacred Scriptures contain, in addition to religious and moral\r\ndoctrines, a true and consistent philosophy; that they were written\r\nfor the good of mankind, at the direct instigation of God himself;\r\nand that all their teachings and promises are truthful, consistent,\r\nand reliable. Whoever holds the contrary conclusion is the victim of\r\nan arrogant false astronomy, of an equally false and presumptuous\r\ngeology, or a suicidal method of reasoning--a logic which never demands\r\na proof of its premises, and which therefore leads to conclusions\r\nwhich are contrary to nature, to human experience, and to the direct\r\nteaching of God’s word, and therefore contrary to the deepest and\r\nmost lasting interests of humanity. “God has spoken to man in two\r\nvoices, the voice of inspiration and the voice of nature. By man’s\r\nignorance they have been made to disagree; but the time will come, and\r\ncannot be far distant, when these two languages will strictly accord;\r\nwhen the science of nature will no longer contradict the science of\r\nscripture.”[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] Professor Hunt.\r\n\r\nCUI BONO.--“Of all terrors to the generous soul, that _Cui bono_ is\r\nthe one to be the most zealously avoided. Whether it be proposed to\r\nfind the magnetic point, or a passage impossible to be utilised if\r\ndiscovered, or a race of men of no good to any human institution\r\nextant, and of no good to themselves; or to seek the Unicorn in\r\nMadagascar, and when we had found him not to be able to make use of\r\nhim; or the great central plateau of Australia, where no one could\r\nlive for centuries to come; or the great African lake, which, for all\r\nthe good it would do us English folk might as well be in the Moon;\r\nor the source of the Nile, the triumphant discovery of which would\r\nneither lower the rents nor take off the taxes anywhere--whatever it\r\nis, the _Cui bono_ is always a weak and cowardly argument: essentially\r\nshort-sighted too, seeing that, according to the law of the past, by\r\nwhich we may always safely predicate the future, so much falls into\r\nthe hands of the seeker, for which he was not looking, and of which\r\nhe never even knew the existence. The area of the possible is very\r\nwide still, and very insignificant and minute, the angle we have\r\nstaked out and marked impossible. What do we know of the powers which\r\nnature has yet in reserve, of the secrets she has still untold, the\r\nwealth still concealed? Every day sees new discoveries in the sciences\r\nwe can investigate at home. What, then, may not lie waiting for the\r\nexplorers abroad? Weak and short-sighted commercially, the _cui bono_\r\nis worse than both, morally. When we remember the powerful manhood,\r\nthe patience, unselfishness, courage, devotion, and nobleness of aim\r\nwhich must accompany a perilous enterprise, and which form so great an\r\nexample, and so heart-stirring to the young and to the wavering, it is\r\nno return to barbaric indifference to life to say, better indeed a few\r\ndeaths for even a commercially useless enterprise--better a few hearths\r\nmade desolate, and a few wives and mothers left to bear their stately\r\nsorrow to the end of time, that the future may rejoice and be strong:\r\nbetter a thousand failures, and a thousand useless undertakings,\r\nthan the loss of national manhood or the weakening of the national\r\nfibre. Quixotism is a folly when the energy which might have achieved\r\nconquests over misery and wrong, if rightfully applied, is wasted in\r\nfighting windmills; but to forego any great enterprise for fear of the\r\ndangers attending, or to check a grand endeavour by the _cui bono_ of\r\nignorance and moral scepticism, is worse than a folly--it is baseness,\r\nand a cowardice.[47]”\r\n\r\n  [47] _Daily News_ of April 5, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe above quotation is an excellent general answer to all those who\r\nmay, in reference to the subject of this work, or to anything which is\r\nnot of immediate worldly interest, obtrude the _cui bono_? But as a\r\nspecial reply it may be claimed for the subject of these pages--\r\n\r\nFirst,--It is more edifying, more satisfactory, and in every sense far\r\nbetter that we should know the true and detect the false. Thereby the\r\nmind becomes fixed, established upon an eternal foundation, and no\r\nlonger subject to those waverings and changes, those oscillations and\r\nfluctuations which are ever the result of falsehood. To know the truth\r\nand to embody it in our lives and purposes our progress must be safe\r\nand rapid, and almost unlimited in extent. None can say to what it may\r\nlead or where it may culminate. Who shall dare to set bounds to the\r\ncapabilities of the mind, or to fix a limit to human progress? Whatever\r\nmay be the destiny of the human race truth alone will help and secure\r\nits realisation.\r\n\r\nSecond,--Having detected the fundamental falsehoods of modern\r\nastronomy, and discovered that the Earth is a plane, and motionless,\r\nand the only material world in existence, we are able to demonstrate\r\nthe actual character of the Universe. In doing this we are enabled to\r\nprove that all the so-called arguments with which so many scientific\r\nbut irreligious men have assailed the scriptures, are absolutely\r\nfalse; have no foundation except in their own astronomical and\r\ngeological theories, which being demonstrably fallacious, they fall\r\nto the ground as valueless. They can no longer be wielded as weapons\r\nagainst religion. If used at all it can only be that their weakness\r\nand utter worthlessness will be exposed. Atheism and every other form\r\nof Infidelity are thus rendered helpless. Their sting is cut away,\r\nand their poison dissipated. The irreligious philosopher can no longer\r\nobtrude his theories as things proved wherewith to test the teachings\r\nof scripture. He must now himself be tested. He must be forced to\r\ndemonstrate his premises, a thing which he has never yet attempted; and\r\nif he fails in this respect his impious vanity, self-conceit and utter\r\ndisregard of justice, will become so clearly apparent that his presence\r\nin the ranks of science will no longer be tolerated. All theory must be\r\nput aside, and the questions at issue must be decided by independent\r\nand practical evidence. This has been done. The process--the _modus\r\noperandi_, and the conclusions derived therefrom have been given in\r\nthe early sections of this work. They are entirely consonant with the\r\nteachings of scripture. The scriptures are therefore literally true,\r\nand must henceforth either alone or in conjunction with practical\r\nscience be used as a standard by which to test the truth or falsehood\r\nof every system which does or may hereafter exist. Philosophy is no\r\nlonger to be employed as a test of scriptural truth, but the scriptures\r\nmay and ought to be the test of all philosophy. Not that they are to\r\nbe used as a test of philosophy simply because they are _thought_ or\r\n_believed_ to be the word of God, but because their literal teachings\r\nin regard to science and natural phenomena, are demonstrably correct.\r\nIt is quite as faulty and unjust for the religious devotee to urge\r\nthe scriptures against the theories of the philosopher simply because\r\nhe _believes_ them to be true, as it is for the philosopher to urge\r\nhis theories against the scriptures only because he disbelieves the\r\none and believes the other. The whole matter must be taken out of the\r\nregion of belief and disbelief. The Christian will be strengthened\r\nand his mind more completely satisfied by having it in his power to\r\ndemonstrate that the scriptures are philosophically true, than he could\r\npossibly be by the simple belief in their validity, unsupported by\r\npractical evidence. On the other hand the Atheist who is met by the\r\nChristian upon purely scientific grounds, and who is not belaboured\r\nwith enunciations of what his antagonist believes, will be led to\r\nlisten and to pay more regard and respect to the reasons advanced\r\nthan he could possibly concede to the purely religious argument, or\r\nto an argument founded upon faith alone. If it can be shown to the\r\natheistical philosopher that his astronomical and geological theories\r\nare fallacious, and that all the expressions in the scriptures which\r\nhave reference to natural phenomena are literally true, he will of\r\nnecessity be led to admit that, apart from all other considerations,\r\nif the _philosophy_ of the scriptures is demonstrably correct, then\r\npossibly their _spiritual_ and _moral_ teachings may also be true; and\r\nif so, they may and indeed must have had a divine origin; and if so\r\nthey are truly the “word of God,” and after all, religion is a grand\r\nreality; and the theories which speculative adventurous philosophers\r\nhave advanced are nothing better than treacherous quicksands into which\r\nmany of the deepest thinkers have been engulphed and lost. By this\r\nprocess many highly intelligent minds have been led to desert the ranks\r\nof Atheism and to rejoin the army of Christian soldiers and devotees.\r\nMany have rejoiced almost beyond expression that the subject of the\r\nEarth’s true form and position in the universe had ever been brought\r\nunder their notice; and doubtless great numbers will yet be induced to\r\nreturn to that allegiance which plain demonstrable truth demands and\r\ndeserves. To induce numbers of earnest thinking human beings to leave\r\nthe rebellious cause of Atheism and false philosophy; to return to a\r\nfull recognition of the beauty and truthfulness of the scriptures, and\r\nto a participation in the joy and satisfaction which religion can alone\r\nsupply, is a grand and cheering result, and one which furnishes the\r\nnoblest possible answer to the ever ready “CUI BONO.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the numerous quotations which have been given from\r\nsacred scriptures, and proved to be true and consistent, it may be\r\nuseful briefly to refer to the following difficulties which have been\r\nraised by the scientific objectors to scriptural authority:--“As the\r\nearth is a globe, and as all its vast collections of water--its oceans,\r\nlakes, &c., are sustained by the earthy crust beneath them, and as\r\nbeneath this ‘crust of the earth’ everything is in a red-hot molten\r\ncondition to what place could the excess of waters retire which are\r\nsaid in the scriptures to have overwhelmed the whole world? It could\r\nnot sink into the centre of the earth, for the fire is there so intense\r\nthat the whole would be rapidly volatilised, and driven away as vapour.\r\nIt could not evaporate, for when the atmosphere is charged with watery\r\nvapour beyond a certain degree it begins to condense and throw back the\r\nwater in the form of rain; so that the waters of the flood could not\r\nsink from the earth’s surface, nor remain in the atmosphere; therefore\r\nif the earth had ever been deluged at all, it would have remained so\r\nto this day. But as it is not universally flooded so it never could\r\nhave been, and the account given in the scriptures is false.” All this\r\nspecious reasoning is founded upon the assumption that the earth is\r\na globe: this doctrine, however, being false, all the difficulties\r\nquickly vanish. The earth being “founded on the seas” would be as\r\nreadily cleared of its superfluous water as would the deck of a ship\r\non emerging from a storm. Or as a rock in the ocean would be cleared\r\nafter the raging waves which for a time overwhelmed it had subsided.\r\n\r\n“Thou coveredst the Earth with the deep as with a garment; the waters\r\nstood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; and at the voice\r\nof thy thunder they hasted away ... down by the valleys unto the place\r\nwhich thou hast founded for them.”[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] Psalm civ.\r\n\r\n“Thou didst cleave the Earth with rivers; and the overflowing of the\r\nwaters passed by; and the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his\r\nhands on high.”[49]\r\n\r\n  [49] Hab. iii. 9-10.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the Earth standing above the level of the surrounding\r\nseas, the waters of the flood would simply and naturally run down by\r\nthe valleys and rivers into the “great deep,”--into which “the waters\r\nreturned from off the earth continually ... until the tenth month, and\r\non the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen.”[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Gen. viii. 2-5.\r\n\r\nAgain; as the Earth is a Globe and in continual motion, how could\r\nJesus on being “taken up into an exceedingly high mountain see all\r\nthe kingdoms of the world, in a moment of time?” Or, when “He cometh\r\nwith clouds and every eye shall see him,” how could it be possible,\r\nseeing that at least twenty-four hours would elapse before every\r\npart of the Earth would be turned to the same point? But it has been\r\ndemonstrated that the Earth is a Plane and motionless, and that from a\r\ngreat eminence every part of its surface could be seen at once; and, at\r\nonce--at the same moment, could every eye behold Him, when “coming in a\r\ncloud with power and great glory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  S.
