The effort\r\n     of the distinguished Statesman who has invested Astronomy with\r\n     new beauties, is the latest and one of the most brilliant of\r\n     his compositions, and is already wholly out of print, though\r\n     scarcely a month has elapsed since the date of its delivery.\r\n     The account of the proceedings at Albany during the Ceremonies\r\n     of Inauguration is necessarily brief, but accurate, and is\r\n     respectfully submitted to the consideration of the reader.\r\n\r\n                                                    A. MAVERICK.\r\n     NEW YORK, _October 1, 1856._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TWO NEW INSTITUTIONS OF SCIENCE;\r\n\r\n                                  AND\r\n\r\n              THE SCENES WHICH ATTENDED THEIR CHRISTENING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of August last, two events took place in the city of\r\nAlbany, which have more than an ephemeral interest. They occurred in\r\nclose connection with the proceedings of a Scientific Convention,\r\nand the memory of them deserves to be cherished as a recollection of\r\nthe easy way in which Science may be popularized and be rendered so\r\ngenerally acceptable that the people will cry, like Oliver Twist, for\r\nmore. It is the purpose of this small publication to embody, in a form\r\nmore durable than that of the daily newspaper, the record of proceedings\r\nwhich have so near a relation to the progress of scientific research. A\r\nmarked feature in the ceremonies was the magnificent Oration of the Hon.\r\nEDWARD EVERETT, inaugurating the Dudley Observatory of Albany; and it is\r\nbelieved that the reissue of that speech in its present form will be\r\nacceptable to the admirers of that distinguished gentleman, not less\r\nthan to the lovers of Science, who hung with delight upon his words.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE DEDICATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL HALL.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, August 27, 1856, the State Geological Hall of New York\r\nwas dedicated with appropriate ceremonies. For the purpose of affording\r\naccommodation to the immense crowds of people who, it was confidently\r\nanticipated, would throng to this demonstration and that of the\r\nsucceeding day, at which Mr. EVERETT spoke, a capacious Tent was\r\narranged with care in the center of Academy Park, on Capitol Hill;\r\nand under its shelter the ceremonies of the inauguration of both\r\ninstitutions were conducted without accident or confusion; attended on\r\nthe first day by fully three thousand persons, and on the second by a\r\nnumber which may be safely computed at from five to seven thousand.\r\n\r\nThe announcement that Hon. WM. H. SEWARD would be present at the\r\ndedication of the Geological Hall, excited great interest among the\r\ncitizens; but the hope of his appearance proved fallacious. His place\r\nwas occupied by seven picked men of the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, one of whom (Prof. HENRY) declared his inability\r\nto compute the problem why seven men of science were to be considered\r\nequal to one statesman. The result justified the selections of the\r\ncommittee, and although the Senator was not present, the seven\r\nCommoners of Science made the occasion a most notable one by the flow\r\nof wit, elegance of phrase, solidity and cogency of argument, and rare\r\ndiscernment of natural truths, with which their discourse was garnished.\r\n\r\nThe members of the American Association marched in procession to the\r\nTent, from their place of meeting in the State Capitol. On the stage\r\nwere assembled many distinguished gentlemen, and in the audience were\r\nhundreds of ladies. GOV. CLARK and Ex-Governors HUNT and SEYMOUR, of New\r\nYork, Sir WM. LOGAN, of Canada, Hon. GEORGE BANCROFT, and others as well\r\nknown as these, were among the number present. The tent was profusely\r\ndecorated. Small banners in tri-color were distributed over the entire\r\narea covered by the stage, and adorned the wings. The following\r\ninscriptions were placed over the front of the rostrum,--that in honor\r\nof \"_The Press_\" occupying a central position:\r\n\r\n                GEOLOGY.                  THE PRESS.\r\n                METEOROLOGY.              MINERALOGY.\r\n                METALLURGY.               ETHNOLOGY.\r\n                              ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nThe following were arranged in various positions on the right and left:\r\n\r\n                CHEMISTRY.                TELEGRAPH.\r\n                PHYSIOLOGY.               LETTERS.\r\n                CONCHOLOGY.               HYDROLOGY.\r\n                PALÆONTOLOGY.             ZOOLOGY.\r\n                MICROSCOPY.               ICHTHYOLOGY.\r\n                ART.                      MANUFACTURES.\r\n                STEAM.                    AGRICULTURE.\r\n                COMMERCE.                 PHYSICS.\r\n                SCIENCE.                  ANATOMY.\r\n                NAVIGATION.               BOTANY.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the day were opened with prayer by Rev. GEO. W.\r\nBETHUNE, D.D., of Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nHon. GARRIT Y. LANSING, of Albany, then introduced Professor LOUIS\r\nAGASSIZ, of Cambridge, Mass., who was the first of the \"seven men\r\nof science\" to entertain his audience, always with the aid of the\r\ninevitable black-board, without which the excellent Professor would be\r\nas much at a loss as a chemist without a laboratory. Professor AGASSIZ\r\nspoke for an hour, giving his views of a new theory of animal\r\ndevelopment. He began by saying:--\r\n\r\n     We are here to inaugurate the Geological Hall, which has grown\r\n     out of the geological survey of the State. To make the occasion\r\n     memorable, a distinguished statesman of your own State, and Mr.\r\n     FRANK C. GRAY, were expected to be present and address you. The\r\n     pressure of public duties has detained Mr. SEWARD, and severe\r\n     sickness has detained Mr. GRAY. I deeply lament that the occasion\r\n     is lost to you to hear my friend Mr. GRAY, who is a devotee to\r\n     science, and as warm-hearted a friend as ever I knew. Night\r\n     before last I was requested to assist in taking their place--I,\r\n     who am the most unfit of men for the post. I never made a speech.\r\n     I have addressed learned bodies, but I lack that liberty of\r\n     speech--the ability to present in finished style, and with that\r\n     rich imagery which characterize the words of the orator, the\r\n     thoughts fitting to such an occasion as this. He would limit\r\n     himself, he continued, to presenting some motives why the\r\n     community should patronize science, and foster such institutions\r\n     as this. We scientific men regard this as an occasion of the\r\n     highest interest, and thus do not hesitate to give the sanction\r\n     of the highest learned body of the country as an indorsement of\r\n     the liberality of this State. The geological survey of New York\r\n     has given to the world a new nomenclature. No geologist can,\r\n     hereafter, describe the several strata of the earth without\r\n     referring to it. Its results, as recorded in your published\r\n     volumes, are treasured in the most valuable libraries of the\r\n     world. They have made this city famous; and now, when the\r\n     scientific geologist lands on your shore, his first question is,\r\n     \"Which is the way to Albany? I want to see your fossils.\" But\r\n     Paleontology is only one branch of the subject, and many others\r\n     your survey has equally fostered.\r\n\r\n     He next proceeded to show that organized beings were organized\r\n     with reference to a plan, which the relations between different\r\n     animals, and between different plants, and between animals and\r\n     plants, everywhere exhibit;--drew sections of the body of a\r\n     fish, and of the bird, and of man, and pointed out that in each\r\n     there was the same central back-bone, the cavity above and\r\n     the ribbed cavity below the flesh on each side, and the skin\r\n     over all--showing that the maker of each possessed the same\r\n     thought--followed the same plan of structure. And upon that plan\r\n     He had made all the kinds of quadrupeds, 2,000 in number, all the\r\n     kinds of birds, 7,000 in number, all of the reptiles, 2,000 to\r\n     3,000 in number, all the fish, 10,000 to 12,000 in number. All\r\n     their forms may be derived as different expressions of the same\r\n     formula. There are only four of these great types; or, said he,\r\n     may I not call them the four tunes on which Divinity has played\r\n     the harmonies that have peopled, in living and beautiful reality,\r\n     the whole world?\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK ON REMINISCENCES.\r\n\r\nERASTUS C. BENEDICT, Esq. of New York, introduced Prof. HITCHCOCK, of\r\nAmherst, as a gentleman whose name was very familiar, who had laid\r\naside, voluntarily, the charge of one of the largest colleges in New\r\nEngland, but who could never lay aside the honors he had earned in the\r\nliterature and science of geology.\r\n\r\nAfter a few introductory observations, Prof. HITCHCOCK said:--\r\n\r\n     This, I believe, is the first example in which a State Government\r\n     in our country has erected a museum for the exhibition of its\r\n     natural resources, its mineral and rock, its plants and animals,\r\n     living and fossil. And this seems to me the most appropriate spot\r\n     in the country for placing the first geological hall erected by\r\n     the Government; for the County of Albany was the district where\r\n     the first geological survey was undertaken, on this side of the\r\n     Atlantic, and, perhaps, the world. This was in 1820, and ordered\r\n     by that eminent philanthropist, Stephen Van Rensselaer, who,\r\n     three years later, appointed Prof. Eaton to survey, in like\r\n     manner, the whole region traversed by the Erie Canal. This was\r\n     the commencement of a work, which, during the last thirty years,\r\n     has had a wonderful expansion, reaching a large part of the\r\n     States of the Union, as well as Canada, Nova Scotia, and New\r\n     Brunswick, and, I might add, several European countries, where\r\n     the magnificent surveys now in progress did not commence till\r\n     after the survey of Albany and Rensselaer Counties. How glad\r\n     are we, therefore, to find on this spot the first Museum of\r\n     Economical Geology on this side of the Atlantic! Nay, embracing\r\n     as it does all the department of Natural History, I see in it\r\n     more than a European Museum of Economical Geology, splendid\r\n     though they are. I fancy, rather, that I see here the germ of a\r\n     Cis-Atlantic British Museum, or Garden of Plants.\r\n\r\n     North Carolina was the first State that ordered a geological\r\n     survey; and I have the pleasure of seeing before me the gentleman\r\n     who executed it, and in 1824-5 published a report of 140 pages.\r\n     I refer to Professor Olmstead, who, though he has since won\r\n     brighter laurels in another department of science, will always be\r\n     honored as the first commissioned State geologist in our land.\r\n\r\nOf the New York State Survey he said:--\r\n\r\n     This survey has developed the older fossiliferous rocks, with a\r\n     fullness and distinctness unknown elsewhere. Hence European\r\n     savans study the New York Reports with eagerness. In 1850, as I\r\n     entered the Woodwardian Museum, in the University of Cambridge,\r\n     in England, I found Professor McCoy busy with a collection of\r\n     Silurian fossils before him, which he was studying with Hall's\r\n     first volume of Paleontology as his guide; and in the splendid\r\n     volumes, entitled _British Paleozoric Rocks and Fossils_, which\r\n     appeared last year as the result of those researches, I find\r\n     Professor Hall denominated the great American Paleontologist. I\r\n     tell you, Sir, that this survey has given New York a reputation\r\n     throughout the learned world, of which she may well be proud. Am\r\n     I told that it will, probably, cost half a million? Very well.\r\n     The larger the sum, the higher will be the reputation of New\r\n     York for liberality; and what other half million expended in our\r\n     country, has developed so many new facts or thrown so much light\r\n     upon the history of the globe, or won so world-wide and enviable\r\n     a reputation?\r\n\r\nAnd of Geological Surveys in general:--\r\n\r\n     In regard to this matter of geological surveys, I can hardly\r\n     avoid making a suggestion here. So large a portion of our country\r\n     has now been examined, more or less thoroughly, by the several\r\n     State governments, that it does seem to me the time has come\r\n     when the National government should order a survey--geological,\r\n     zoological, and botanical--of the whole country, on such a\r\n     liberal and thorough plan as the surveys in Great Britain are\r\n     now conducted; in the latter country it being understood that at\r\n     least thirty years will be occupied in the work. Could not the\r\n     distinguished New York statesman who was to have addressed us\r\n     to-day be induced, when the present great struggle in which he\r\n     is engaged shall have been brought to a close, by a merciful\r\n     Providence, to introduce this subject, and urge it upon Congress?\r\n     And would it not be appropriate for the American Association\r\n     for the Advancement of Science to throw a petition before the\r\n     government for such an object? Or might it not, with the consent\r\n     of the eminent gentleman who has charge of the Coast Survey, be\r\n     connected therewith, as it is with the Ordnance Survey in Great\r\n     Britain.\r\n\r\nThe history of the American Association was then given:--\r\n\r\n     Prof. Mather, I believe, through Prof. Emmons, first suggested to\r\n     the New-York Board of Geologists in November, 1838, in a letter\r\n     proposing a number of points for their consideration. I quote\r\n     from him the following paragraph relating to the meeting. As to\r\n     the credit he has here given me of having personally suggested\r\n     the subject, I can say only that I had been in the habit for\r\n     several years of making this meeting of scientific men a sort\r\n     of hobby in my correspondence with such. Whether others did the\r\n     same, I did not then, and do not now know. Were this the proper\r\n     place, I could go more into detail on this point; but I will\r\n     merely quote Prof. Mather's language to the Board:--\r\n\r\n       * * * * \"Would it not be well to suggest the propriety of a\r\n     meeting of Geologists and other scientific men of our country at\r\n     some central point next fall,--say at New-York or Philadelphia?\r\n     There are many questions in our Geology that will receive new\r\n     light from friendly discussion and the combined observations of\r\n     various individuals who have noted them in different parts of our\r\n     country. Such a meeting has been suggested by Prof. Hitchcock;\r\n     and to me it seems desirable. It would undoubtedly be an\r\n     advantage not only to science but to the several surveys that are\r\n     now in progress and that may in future be authorized. It would\r\n     tend to make known our scientific men to each other personally,\r\n     give them more confidence in each other, and cause them to\r\n     concentrate their observation on those questions that are of\r\n     interest in either a scientific or economical point of view. More\r\n     questions may be satisfactorily settled in a day by oral\r\n     discussion in such a body, than a year by writing and\r\n     publication.\"[A]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote A: In the letter alluded to, on examination, we\r\n     discover another passage bearing on the point, which, owing to\r\n     the Professor's modesty we suspect, he did not read. Prof. Mather\r\n     adds. \"You, so far as I know, first suggested the matter of such\r\n     an Association. I laid the matter before the Board of Geologists\r\n     of New-York, specifying some of the advantages that might be\r\n     expected to result; and Prof. Vanuxem probably made the motion\r\n     before the Board in regard to it.\"]\r\n\r\n     Though the Board adopted the plan of a meeting, various causes\r\n     delayed the first over till April, 1840, when we assembled in\r\n     Philadelphia, and spent a week in most profitable and pleasant\r\n     discussion, and the presentation of papers. Our number that year\r\n     was only 18, because confined almost exclusively to the State\r\n     geologists; but the next year, when we met again in Philadelphia,\r\n     and a more extended invitation was given, about eighty were\r\n     present; and the members have been increasing to the present\r\n     time. But, in fact, those first two meetings proved the type, in\r\n     all things essential, of all that have followed. The principal\r\n     changes have been those of expansion and the consequent\r\n     introduction of many other branches of science with their eminent\r\n     cultivators. In 1842, we changed the name to that of the\r\n     Association of American Geologists and Naturalists; and in 1847,\r\n     to that of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\n     Science. I trust it has not yet reached its fullest development,\r\n     as our country and its scientific men multiply, and new fields of\r\n     discovery open.\r\n\r\nProf. H. said of this particular occasion:--\r\n\r\n     We may be quite sure that this Hall will be a center of deep\r\n     interest to coming generations. Long after we shall have passed\r\n     away will the men of New-York, as they survey these monuments,\r\n     feel stimulated to engage in other noble enterprises by this\r\n     work of their progenitors, and from many a distant part of the\r\n     civilized world will men come here to solve their scientific\r\n     questions, and to bring far-off regions into comparison with\r\n     this. New-York, then, by her liberal patronage, has not only\r\n     acquired an honorable name among those living in all civilized\r\n     lands, but has secured the voice of History to transmit her fame\r\n     to far-off generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SIR WILLIAM LOGAN ASKS \"THE WAY TO ALBANY.\"\r\n\r\nSir WILLIAM E. LOGAN, of Canada, in a brief speech acknowledged the\r\nservices rendered by the New-York Survey to Canada. He should manifest\r\ningratitude if he declined to unite in the joyful occasion of\r\ninaugurating the Museum which was to hold forever the evidence of the\r\ntruth of its published results. The Survey of Canada had been ordered,\r\nand the Commission of five years twice renewed; and the last time, the\r\nprovision for it was more than doubled. It happened to him, as Mr.\r\nAgassiz had said: after crossing the ocean first, the first thing he\r\nasked was, \"Which is the way to Albany?\" and when he arrived here, he\r\nfound that with the aid of Prof. Hall's discoveries, he had only to take\r\nup the different formations as he had left them on the boundary line,\r\nand follow them into Canada. It was both a convenience and a necessity\r\nto adopt the New-York nomenclature, which was thus extended over an area\r\nsix times as large as New-York. In Paris he heard De Vernier using the\r\nwords Trenton and Niagara, as if they were household words. He was\r\ndelighted to witness the impatience with which Barron inquired when the\r\nremaining volumes of the Paleontology of New-York would be published.\r\nYour Paleontological reputation, said he, has made New-York known,\r\neven among men not scientific, all over Europe. I hope you will not\r\nstop here, but will go on and give us in equally thorough, full, and\r\nmagnificent style, the character of the Durassic and Cretaceous\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PROFESSOR HENRY ON DUTCHMEN.\r\n\r\nProfessor HENRY was at a loss to know by what process they had arrived\r\nat the conclusion that seven men of science must be substituted to fill\r\nthe place of one distinguished statesman whom they had expected to hear.\r\nHe prided himself on his Albany nativity. He was proud of the old Dutch\r\ncharacter, that was the substratum of the city. The Dutch are hard to be\r\nmoved, but when they do start their momentum is not as other men's in\r\nproportion to the velocity, but as the square of the velocity. So when\r\nthe Dutchman goes three times as fast, he has nine times the force of\r\nanother man. The Dutchman has an immense potentia agency, but it wants a\r\nsmall spark of Yankee enterprise to touch it off. In this strain the\r\nProfessor continued, making his audience very merry, and giving them a\r\nfine chance to express themselves with repeated explosions of laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n          PROFESSOR DAVIES ON THE PRACTICAL NATURE OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nProf. CHARLES DAVIES was introduced by EX-GOVERNOR SEYMOUR, and spoke\r\nbriefly, but humorously and very much to the point, in defense of the\r\npractical character of scientific researches. He said that to one\r\naccustomed to speak only on the abstract quantities of number and space,\r\nthis was an unusual occasion, and this an unusual audience; and inquired\r\nhow he could discuss the abstract forms of geometry, when he saw before\r\nhim, in such profusion, the most beautiful real forms that Providence\r\nhas vouchsafed to the life of man. He proposed to introduce and develop\r\nbut a single train of thought--the unchangeable connection between what\r\nin common language is called the theoretical and practical, but in more\r\ntechnical phraseology, the ideal and the actual. The actual, or true\r\npractical, consists in the uses of the forces of nature, according to\r\nthe laws of nature; and here we must distinguish between it and the\r\nempirical, which uses, or attempts to use, those forces, without a\r\nknowledge of the laws. The true practical, therefore, is the result, or\r\nactual, of an antecedent ideal. The ideal, full and complete, must exist\r\nin the mind before the actual can be brought forth according to the\r\nlaws of science. Who, then, are the truly practical men of our age? Are\r\nthey not those who are engaged most laboriously and successfully in\r\ninvestigating the great laws? Are they not those who are pressing out\r\nthe boundaries of knowledge, and conducting the mind into new and\r\nunexplored regions, where there may yet be discovered a California of\r\nundeveloped thought? Is not the gentleman from Massachusetts (Professor\r\nAgassiz) the most practical man in our country in the department of\r\nNatural History, not because he has collected the greatest number of\r\nspecimens, but because he has laid open to us all the laws of the animal\r\nkingdom? Are the formulas written on the black-board by the gentleman\r\nfrom Cambridge (Prof. Pierce) of no practical value, because they cannot\r\nbe read by the uninstructed eye? A single line may contain the elements\r\nof the motions of all the heavenly bodies; and the eye of science,\r\ntaking its stand-point at the center of gravity of the system, will\r\nsee in the equation the harmonious revolutions of all the bodies which\r\ncircle the heavens. It is such labors and such generalizations that have\r\nrendered his name illustrious in the history of mathematical science.\r\nIs it of no practical value that the Chief of the Coast Survey (Prof.\r\nBache), by a few characters written upon paper, at Washington, has\r\ndetermined the exact time of high and low tide in the harbor of Boston,\r\nand can determine, by a similar process, the exact times of high and low\r\nwater at every point on the surface of the globe? Are not these results,\r\nthe highest efforts of science, also of the greatest practical utility?\r\nAnd may we not, then, conclude that _there is nothing truly practical\r\nwhich is not the consequence of an antecedent ideal_?\r\n\r\nScience is to art what the great fly-wheel and governor of a\r\nsteam-engine are to the working part of the machinery--it guides,\r\nregulates, and controls the whole. Science and art are inseparably\r\nconnected; like the Siamese Twins, they cannot be separated without\r\nproducing the death of both.\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to regard the superb specimens of natural history,\r\nwhich the liberality, the munificence; and the wisdom of our State have\r\ncollected at the Capitol? They are the elements from which we can here\r\ndetermine all that belongs to the Natural History of our State; and may\r\nwe not indulge the hope, that science and genius will come here, and,\r\nstriking them with a magic wand, cause the true practical to spring into\r\nimmortal life?\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarks were also uttered by Prof. CHESTER DEWEY, President ANDERSON,\r\nand Rev. Dr. COX.\r\n\r\nAnd thus ended the Inauguration of the State Geological Hall.\r\n\r\nWe turn to the Observatory, in regular order of succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  INAUGURATION OF DUDLEY OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Inauguration of the Dudley Observatory took place under the same\r\ntent which was appropriated to the dedication of the Geological Hall,\r\nand on the day following that event. An immense audience was assembled,\r\ndrawn by the announcement of Mr. EVERETT'S Oration.\r\n\r\nAt a little past three o'clock the procession of _savans_ arrived from\r\nthe Assembly Chamber, escorted by the Burgesses Corps. Directly in front\r\nof the speaker's stand sat Mrs. DUDLEY, the venerable lady to whose\r\nmunificence the world is indebted for this Observatory. She was dressed\r\nin an antique, olive-colored silk, with a figure of a lighter color, a\r\nheavy, red broché shawl, and her bonnet, cap, &c., after the strictest\r\nstyle of the old school. Her presence added a new point of interest.\r\n\r\nPrayer having been uttered by Rev. Dr. SPRAGUE, of Albany, THOMAS W.\r\nOLCOTT, Esq., introduced to the audience Ex-Governor WASHINGTON HUNT,\r\nwho spoke briefly in honor of the memory of CHARLES E. DUDLEY, whose\r\nwidow has founded and in part endowed this Observatory with a liberality\r\nso remarkable.\r\n\r\nRemarks were offered by Dr. B. A. GOULD and Prof. A. D. BACHE, and\r\nJudge HARRIS read the following letter from Mrs. DUDLEY, announcing\r\nanother munificent donation in aid of the new Observatory--$50,000,\r\nin addition to the $25,000 which had been already expended in the\r\nconstruction of the building. The letter was received with shouts of\r\napplause, Prof. AGASSIZ rising and leading the vast assemblage in three\r\nvehement cheers in honor of Mrs. DUDLEY!\r\n\r\n                                        ALBANY, Thursday, Aug. 14, 1856.\r\n\r\n_To the Trustees of the Dudley Observatory:_\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--I scarcely need refer in a letter to you to the\r\n     modest beginning and gradual growth of the institution over which\r\n     you preside, and of which you are the responsible guardians. But\r\n     we have arrived at a period in its history when its inauguration\r\n     gives to it and to you some degree of prominence, and which must\r\n     stamp our past efforts with weakness and inconsideration, or\r\n     exalt those of the future to the measure of liberality necessary\r\n     to certain success.\r\n\r\n     You have a building erected and instruments engaged of unrivaled\r\n     excellence; and it now remains to carry out the suggestion of\r\n     the Astronomer Royal of England in giving permanency to the\r\n     establishment. The very distinguished Professors BACHE, PIERCE,\r\n     and GOULD, state in a letter, which I have been permitted to see,\r\n     that to expand this institution to the wants of American science\r\n     and the honors of a national character, will require an\r\n     investment which will yield annually not less than $10,000; and\r\n     these gentlemen say, in the letter referred to,--\r\n\r\n     \"If the greatness of your giving can rise to this occasion, as\r\n     it has to all our previous suggestions, with such unflinching\r\n     magnanimity, we promise you our earnest and hearty coöperation,\r\n     and stake our reputation that the scientific success shall fill\r\n     up the measure of your hopes and anticipations.\"\r\n\r\n     For the attainment of an object so rich in scientific reward and\r\n     national glory, guaranteed by men with reputations as exalted and\r\n     enduring as the skies upon which they are written, contributions\r\n     should be general, and not confined to an individual or a place.\r\n\r\n     For myself, I offer, as my part of the required endowment, the\r\n     sum of $50,000 in addition to the advances which I have already\r\n     made; and, trusting that the name which you have given to the\r\n     Observatory may not be regarded as an undeserved compliment, and\r\n     that it will not diminish the public regard by giving to the\r\n     institution a seemingly individual character,\r\n\r\n                     I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                    BLANDINA DUDLEY.\r\n\r\nJudge HARRIS then introduced the Orator of the occasion, Hon. EDWARD\r\nEVERETT, whose speech is given verbatim in these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE DUDLEY OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nDuring the Sessions of the American Association, the new Astronomical\r\nInstruments of Dudley Observatory were described in detail by Dr. B. A.\r\nGOULD, who is the Astronomer in charge. We condense his statements:--\r\n\r\n     The Meridian Circle and Transit instrument were ordered from\r\n     Pistor & Martins, the celebrated manufacturers of Berlin, by\r\n     whom the new instrument at Ann Arbor was made. A number of\r\n     improvements have been introduced in the Albany instruments, not\r\n     perhaps all absolutely new, but an eclectic combination of late\r\n     adaptations with new improvements. Dr. Gould made a distinction\r\n     of modern astronomical instruments into two classes, the English\r\n     and the German. The English is the massive type; the German,\r\n     light and airy. The English instrument is the instrument of the\r\n     engineer; the German, the instrument of the artist. In ordering\r\n     the instruments for the Albany Observatory, the Doctor preferred\r\n     the German type and discarded the heavier English. He instanced,\r\n     as a specimen of the latter, the new instrument at Greenwich,\r\n     recently erected under the superintendence of the Astronomer\r\n     Royal. That instrument registers observations in single seconds;\r\n     the Dudley instrument will register to tenths of seconds. That\r\n     has six or eight microscopes; this has four. That has a gas lamp,\r\n     by the light of which the graduations are read off; the Albany\r\n     instrument has no lamp, and the Doctor considered the lamp a\r\n     hazardous experiment, affecting the integrity of the experiment,\r\n     not only by its radiant heat but by the currents of heated air\r\n     which it produces. The diameter of the object-glass of the Albany\r\n     instrument is 7-1/2 French inches clear aperture, or 8 English\r\n     inches, and the length of the tube 8 feet. He would have\r\n     preferred an instrument in which the facilities of manipulation\r\n     would have been greater, but was hampered by one proviso, upon\r\n     which the Trustees of the institution insisted--that this should\r\n     be the biggest instrument of its kind; and the instruction was\r\n     obeyed. The glass was made by Chance, and ground by Pistor\r\n     himself. The eye-piece is fitted with two micrometers, for\r\n     vertical and horizontal observations. Another apparatus provides\r\n     for the detection and measurement of the flexure of the tube.\r\n     Much trouble was experienced in securing a good casting for the\r\n     steel axis of the instrument. Three were found imperfect under\r\n     the lathe, and the fourth was chosen; but even then the pivots\r\n     were made in separate pieces, which were set in very deeply and\r\n     welded. Dr. Gould said he had been requested by the gentlemen who\r\n     had this enterprise in charge to suggest, as a mark of respect to\r\n     a gentleman of Albany who was a munificent patron of Science,\r\n     that this instrument be known as the Olcott Meridian Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     WHAT THE DUDLEY OBSERVATORY IS.\r\n\r\nIt stands a mile from the Capitol, in the city of Albany, upon the crest\r\nof a hill, so difficult of approach, as to be in reality a Hill of\r\nScience. There are two ways of getting to it. In both cases there are\r\nrail fences to be clambered over, and long grass to wade through,\r\nsettlements to explore, and a clayey road to travel; but these are minor\r\ntroubles. The elevation of the hill above tide-water is, perhaps, 200\r\nfeet; its distance from the Capitol about a mile and a half. The view\r\nfor miles is unimpeded; and the Observatory is belted about with woods\r\nand verdant lawns. There could not be a finer location or a purer air.\r\nThe plateau contains some fifteen acres.\r\n\r\nThe Observatory is constructed in the form of a Latin cross. Its eastern\r\narm is an apartment 22 by 24 feet, in which the meridian circle is to be\r\nplaced. The western arm is a room of the same dimensions, intended for\r\nthe transit instrument. From the north and south faces of both rooms\r\nare semi-circular apsides, projecting 6 feet 6 inches, containing the\r\nCollimator piers and the vertical openings for observation. The entire\r\nlength of each room is, therefore, 37 feet. In the northern arm are\r\nplaced the library, 23 feet by 27 feet; two computing rooms, 12 feet\r\nby 23 feet each; side entrance halls, staircases, &c. The southern arm\r\ncontains the principal entrance, consisting of an arched colonnade of\r\nfour Tuscan columns, surrounded by a pediment. A broad flight of stone\r\nsteps leads to this colonnade; and through the entrance door beneath\r\nit to the main central hall, 28 feet square, in which are placed (in\r\nniches) the very beautiful electric clock and pendulum presented by\r\nErastus Corning, Esq. The center of this hall is occupied by a massive\r\npier of stone, 10 feet square, passing from the basement into the dome\r\nabove, and intended for the support of the great heliometer. Directly\r\nopposite the entrance door is a large niche, in which it is proposed to\r\nplace the bust of the late Mr. Dudley. Immediately above this hall is\r\nthe equatorial room, a circular apartment, 22 feet 6 inches in diameter,\r\nand 24 feet high, covered by a low conical roof, in which and in the\r\nwalls are the usual observing slits. The drum, or cylindrical portion,\r\nof this room is divided into two parts--the lower one fixed, the upper,\r\nrevolving on cast-iron balls moving in grooved metal plates, can command\r\nthe entire horizon.\r\n\r\nThe building is in two stories--the upper of brick, with freestone\r\nquoins, impost and window and door dressings, rests upon a rusticated\r\nbasement of freestone, six feet high. The style adopted is the modern\r\nItalian, of which it is a very excellent specimen. The building has been\r\ncompleted some time; but, in consequence of the size of the instruments\r\nnow procured being greater than that originally contemplated, sundry\r\nalterations were required in the Transit and Meridian Circle rooms.\r\nThese consist of the semi-circular projections already mentioned, and\r\nwhich, by varying the outlines of the building, will add greatly to its\r\nbeauty and picturesqueness.\r\n\r\nThe piers for the Meridian Circle and Transit have, after careful\r\ninvestigation, been procured from the Lockport quarries. The great\r\ndensity and uniformity of the structure of the stone, and the facility\r\nwith which such large masses as are required for this purpose can be\r\nprocured there, have induced the selection of these quarries. The stones\r\nwill weigh from six and a half to eight tons each.\r\n\r\nThe main building was erected from the drawings of Messrs. Woollett and\r\nOgden, Architects, Albany; the additions and the machinery have been\r\ndesigned by Mr. W. Hodgins, Civil Engineer; and the latter is now being\r\nconstructed under his superintendence, in a very superior manner, at the\r\niron works of Messrs. Pruyn and Lansing, Albany.\r\n\r\nThe entire building is a tasteful and elegant structure, much superior\r\nin architectural character to any other in America devoted to a similar\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS OF ALBANY:--\r\n\r\nAssembled as we are, under your auspices, in this ancient and hospitable\r\ncity, for an object indicative of a highly-advanced stage of scientific\r\nculture, it is natural, in the first place, to cast a historical glance\r\nat the past. It seems almost to surpass belief, though an unquestioned\r\nfact, that more than a century should have passed away, after Cabot had\r\ndiscovered the coast of North America for England, before any knowledge\r\nwas gained of the noble river on which your city stands, and which was\r\ndestined by Providence to determine, in after times, the position of the\r\ncommercial metropolis of the Continent. It is true that Verazzano, a\r\nbold and sagacious Florentine navigator, in the service of France, had\r\nentered the Narrows in 1524, which he describes as a very large river,\r\ndeep at its mouth, which forced its way through steep hills to the sea;\r\nbut though he, like all the naval adventurers of that age, was sailing\r\nwestward in search of a shorter passage to India, he left this part\r\nof the coast without any attempt to ascend the river; nor can it be\r\ngathered from his narrative that he believed it to penetrate far into\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VOYAGE OF HENDRICK HUDSON.\r\n\r\nNear a hundred years elapsed before that great thought acquired\r\nsubstance and form. In the spring of 1609, the heroic but unfortunate\r\nHudson, one of the brightest names in the history of English maritime\r\nadventure, but then in the employment of the Dutch East India Company,\r\nin a vessel of eighty tons, bearing the very astronomical name of the\r\n_Half Moon_, having been stopped by the ice in the Polar Sea, in the\r\nattempt to reach the East by the way of Nova Zembla, struck over to the\r\ncoast of America in a high northern latitude. He then stretched down\r\nsouthwardly to the entrance of Chesapeake Bay (of which he had gained\r\na knowledge from the charts and descriptions of his friend, Captain\r\nSmith), thence returning to the north, entered Delaware Bay, standing\r\nout again to sea, arrived on the second of September in sight of the\r\n\"high hills\" of Neversink, pronouncing it \"a good land to fall in with,\r\nand a pleasant land to see;\" and, on the following morning, sending his\r\nboat before him to sound the way, passed Sandy Hook, and there came to\r\nanchor on the third of September, 1609; two hundred and forty-seven\r\nyears ago next Wednesday. What an event, my friends, in the history of\r\nAmerican population, enterprise, commerce, intelligence, and power--the\r\ndropping of that anchor at Sandy Hook!\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DISCOVERY OF THE HUDSON RIVER.\r\n\r\nHere he lingered a week, in friendly intercourse with the natives of New\r\nJersey, while a boat's company explored the waters up to Newark Bay. And\r\nnow the great question. Shall he turn back, like Verazzano, or ascend\r\nthe stream? Hudson was of a race not prone to turn back, by sea or by\r\nland. On the eleventh of September he raised the anchor of the _Half\r\nMoon_, passed through the Narrows, beholding on both sides \"as beautiful\r\na land as one can tread on;\" and floated cautiously and slowly up the\r\nnoble stream--the first ship that ever rested on its bosom. He passed\r\nthe Palisades, nature's dark basaltic Malakoff, forced the iron gateway\r\nof the Highlands, anchored, on the fourteenth, near West Point; swept\r\nonward and upward, the following day, by grassy meadows and tangled\r\nslopes, hereafter to be covered with smiling villages;--by elevated\r\nbanks and woody heights, the destined site of towns and cities--of\r\nNewburg, Poughkeepsie, Catskill;--on the evening of the fifteenth\r\narrived opposite \"the mountains which lie from the river side,\" where\r\nhe found \"a very loving people and very old men;\" and the day following\r\nsailed by the spot hereafter to be honored by his own illustrious name.\r\nOne more day wafts him up between Schodac and Castleton; and here he\r\nlanded and passed a day with the natives,--greeted with all sorts of\r\nbarbarous hospitality,--the land \"the finest for cultivation he ever set\r\nfoot on,\" the natives so kind and gentle, that when they found he would\r\nnot remain with them over night, and feared that he left them--poor\r\nchildren of nature!--because he was afraid of their weapons,--he, whose\r\nquarter-deck was heavy with ordnance,--they \"broke their arrows in\r\npieces, and threw them in the fire.\" On the following morning, with\r\nthe early flood-tide, on the 19th of September, 1609, the _Half Moon_\r\n\"ran higher up, two leagues above the Shoals,\" and came to anchor in\r\ndeep water, near the site of the present city of Albany. Happy if he\r\ncould have closed his gallant career on the banks of the stream which\r\nso justly bears his name, and thus have escaped the sorrowful and\r\nmysterious catastrophe which awaited him the next year!\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHAMPLAIN'S VOYAGE AND THE GROWTH OF COLONIES.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery of your great river and of the site of your ancient\r\ncity, is not the only event which renders the year 1609 memorable in the\r\nannals of America and the world. It was one of those years in which a\r\nsort of sympathetic movement toward great results unconsciously pervades\r\nthe races and the minds of men. While Hudson discovered this mighty\r\nriver and this vast region for the Dutch East India Company, Champlain,\r\nin the same year, carried the lilies of France to the beautiful\r\nlake which bears his name on your northern limits; the languishing\r\nestablishments of England in Virginia were strengthened by the second\r\ncharter granted to that colony; the little church of Robinson removed\r\nfrom Amsterdam to Leyden, from which, in a few years, they went forth,\r\nto lay the foundations of New England on Plymouth Rock; the seven United\r\nProvinces of the Netherlands, after that terrific struggle of forty\r\nyears (the commencement of which has just been embalmed in a record\r\nworthy of the great event by an American historian) wrested from Spain\r\nthe virtual acknowledgment of their independence, in the Twelve Years'\r\nTruce; and James the First, in the same year, granted to the British\r\nEast India Company their first permanent charter,--corner-stone of an\r\nempire destined in two centuries to overshadow the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GALILEO'S DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nOne more incident is wanting to complete the list of the memorable\r\noccurrences which signalize the year 1609, and one most worthy to be\r\nremembered by us on this occasion. Cotemporaneously with the events\r\nwhich I have enumerated--eras of history, dates of empire, the\r\nstarting-point in some of the greatest political, social, and moral\r\nrevolutions in our annals, an Italian astronomer, who had heard of the\r\nmagnifying glasses which had been made in Holland, by which distant\r\nobjects could be brought seemingly near, caught at the idea, constructed\r\na telescope, and pointed it to the heavens. Yes, my friends, in the same\r\nyear in which Hudson discovered your river and the site of your ancient\r\ntown, in which Robinson made his melancholy hegira from Amsterdam to\r\nLeyden, Galileo Galilei, with a telescope, the work of his own hands,\r\ndiscovered the phases of Venus and the satellites of Jupiter; and now,\r\nafter the lapse of less than two centuries and a half, on a spot then\r\nembosomed in the wilderness--the covert of the least civilized of all\r\nthe races of men--we are assembled--descendants of the Hollanders,\r\ndescendants of the Pilgrims, in this ancient and prosperous city, to\r\ninaugurate the establishment of a first-class Astronomical Observatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EARLY DAYS OF ALBANY.\r\n\r\nOne more glance at your early history. Three years after the landing of\r\nthe Pilgrims at Plymouth, Fort Orange was erected, in the center of what\r\nis now the business part of the city of Albany; and, a few years later,\r\nthe little hamlet of Beverswyck began to nestle under its walls. Two\r\ncenturies ago, my Albanian friends, this very year, and I believe this\r\nvery month of August, your forefathers assembled, not to inaugurate an\r\nobservatory, but to lay the foundations of a new church, in the place of\r\nthe rude cabin which had hitherto served them in that capacity. It was\r\nbuilt at the intersection of Yonker's and Handelaar's, better known\r\nto you as State and Market streets. Public and private liberality\r\ncoöperated in the important work. The authorities at the Fort gave\r\nfifteen hundred guilders; the patroon of that early day, with the\r\nliberality coëval with the name and the race, contributed a thousand;\r\nwhile the inhabitants, for whose benefit it was erected, whose numbers\r\nwere small and their resources smaller, contributed twenty beavers \"for\r\nthe purchase of an oaken pulpit in Holland.\" Whether the largest part of\r\nthis subscription was bestowed by some liberal benefactress, tradition\r\nhas not informed us.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NEW AMSTERDAM\r\n\r\nNor is the year 1656 memorable in the annals of Albany alone. In\r\nthat same year your imperial metropolis, then numbering about three\r\nhundred inhabitants, was first laid out as a city, by the name of New\r\nAmsterdam.[A] In eight years more, New Netherland becomes New York; Fort\r\nOrange and its dependent hamlet assumes the name of Albany. A century\r\nof various fortune succeeds; the scourge of French and Indian war is\r\nrarely absent from the land; every shock of European policy vibrates\r\nwith electric rapidity across the Atlantic; but the year 1756 finds\r\na population of 300,000 in your growing province. Albany, however,\r\nmay still be regarded almost as a frontier settlement. Of the twelve\r\ncounties into which the province was divided a hundred years ago, the\r\ncounty of Albany comprehended all that lay north and west of the city;\r\nand the city itself contained but about three hundred and fifty houses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: These historical notices are, for the most part, abridged\r\nfrom Mr. Brodhead's excellent history of New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TWO HUNDRED YEARS.\r\n\r\nOne more century; another act in the great drama of empire; another\r\nFrench and Indian War beneath the banners of England; a successful\r\nRevolution, of which some of the most momentous events occurred within\r\nyour limits; a union of States; a Constitution of Federal Government;\r\nyour population carried to the St. Lawrence and the great Lakes, and\r\ntheir waters poured into the Hudson; your territory covered with a\r\nnet-work of canals and railroads, filled with life and action, and\r\npower, with all the works of peaceful art and prosperous enterprise with\r\nall the institutions which constitute and advance the civilization of\r\nthe age; its population exceeding that of the Union at the date of the\r\nRevolution; your own numbers twice as large as those of the largest city\r\nof that day, you have met together, my Friends, just two hundred years\r\nsince the erection of the little church of Beverswyck, to dedicate a\r\nnoble temple of science and to take a becoming public notice of the\r\nestablishment of an institution, destined, as we trust, to exert a\r\nbeneficial influence on the progress of useful knowledge at home and\r\nabroad, and through that on the general cause of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that I am careful to say the progress of science \"at\r\nhome and abroad;\" for the study of Astronomy in this country has long\r\nsince, I am happy to add, passed that point where it is content to\r\nrepeat the observations and verify the results of European research. It\r\nhas boldly and successfully entered the field of original investigation,\r\ndiscovery, and speculation; and there is not now a single department of\r\nthe science in which the names of American observers and mathematicians\r\nare not cited by our brethren across the water, side by side with the\r\nmost eminent of their European contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThis state of things is certainly recent. During the colonial period\r\nand in the first generation after the Revolution, no department of\r\nscience was, for obvious causes, very extensively cultivated in\r\nAmerica--astronomy perhaps as much as the kindred branches. The\r\nimprovement in the quadrant, commonly known as Hadley's, had already\r\nbeen made at Philadelphia by Godfrey, in the early part of the last\r\ncentury; and the beautiful invention of the collimating telescope was\r\nmade at a later period by Rittenhouse, an astronomer of distinguished\r\nrepute. The transits of Venus of 1761 and 1769 were observed, and\r\norreries were constructed in different parts of the country; and some\r\nrespectable scientific essays are contained and valuable observations\r\nare recorded in the early volumes of the Transactions of the\r\nPhilosophical Society, at Philadelphia, and the American Academy of Arts\r\nand Sciences at Boston and Cambridge. But in the absence of a numerous\r\nclass of men of science to encourage and aid each other, without\r\nobservatories and without valuable instruments, little of importance\r\ncould be expected in the higher walks of astronomical life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AMERICAN OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe greater the credit due for the achievement of an enterprise\r\ncommenced in the early part of the present century, and which would\r\nreflect honor on the science of any country and any age; I mean the\r\ntranslation and commentary on Laplace's _Mécanique Celeste_, by\r\nBowditch; a work of whose merit I am myself wholly unable to form\r\nan opinion, but which I suppose places the learned translator and\r\ncommentator on a level with the ablest astronomers and geometers of the\r\nday. This work may be considered as opening a new era in the history\r\nof American science. The country was still almost wholly deficient in\r\ninstrumental power; but the want was generally felt by men of science,\r\nand the public mind in various parts of the country began to be turned\r\ntowards the means of supplying it. In 1825, President John Quincy Adams\r\nbrought the subject of a National Observatory before Congress. Political\r\nconsiderations prevented its being favorably entertained at that\r\ntime; and it was not till 1842, and as an incident of the exploring\r\nexpedition, that an appropriation was made for a dépôt for the charts\r\nand instruments of the Navy. On this modest basis has been reared the\r\nNational Observatory at Washington; an institution which has already\r\ntaken and fully sustains an honorable position among the scientific\r\nestablishments of the age.\r\n\r\nBesides the institution at Washington, fifteen or twenty observatories\r\nhave within the last few years, been established in different parts\r\nof the country, some of them on a modest scale, for the gratification\r\nof the scientific taste and zeal of individuals, others on a broad\r\nfoundation of expense and usefulness. In these establishments,\r\npublic and private, the means are provided for the highest order of\r\nastronomical observation, research, and instruction. There is already\r\nin the country an amount of instrumental power (to which addition\r\nis constantly making), and of mathematical skill on the part of our\r\nmen of science, adequate to a manly competition with their European\r\ncontemporaries. The fruits are already before the world, in the\r\ntriangulation of several of the States, in the great work of the Coast\r\nSurvey, in the numerous scientific surveys of the interior of the\r\nContinent, in the astronomical department of the Exploring Expedition,\r\nin the scientific expedition to Chili, in the brilliant hydrographical\r\nlabors of the Observatory at Washington, in the published observations\r\nof Washington and Cambridge, in the Journal conducted by the Nestor\r\nof American Science, now in its eighth lustrum; in the _Sidereal\r\nMessenger_, the _Astronomical Journal_, and the _National Ephemeris_;\r\nin the great chronometrical expeditions to determine the longitude of\r\nCambridge, better ascertained than that of Paris was till within the\r\nlast year; in the prompt rectification of the errors in the predicted\r\nelements of Neptune; in its identification with Lalande's missing star,\r\nand in the calculation of its ephemeris; in the discovery of the\r\nsatellite of Neptune, of the eighth satellite of Saturn, and of the\r\ninnermost of its rings; in the establishment, both by observation and\r\ntheory, of the non-solid character of Saturn's rings; in the separation\r\nand measurement of many double and triple stars, amenable only to\r\nsuperior instrumental power, in the immense labor already performed\r\nin preparing star catalogues, and in numerous accurate observations\r\nof standard stars; in the diligent and successful observation of the\r\nmeteoric showers; in an extensive series of magnetic observations; in\r\nthe discovery of an asteroid and ten or twelve telescopic comets; in\r\nthe resolution of nebulæ which had defied every thing in Europe but\r\nLord Rosse's great reflector; in the application of electricity to the\r\nmeasurement of differences in longitude; in the ascertainment of the\r\nvelocity of the electro-magnetic fluid, and its truly wonderful uses\r\nin recording astronomical observations. These are but a portion of the\r\nachievements of American astronomical science within fifteen or twenty\r\nyears, and fully justify the most sanguine anticipations of its further\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nHow far our astronomers may be able to pursue their researches, will\r\ndepend upon the resources of our public institutions, and the liberality\r\nof wealthy individuals in furnishing the requisite means. With the\r\nexception of the observatories at Washington and West Point, little\r\ncan be done, or be expected to be done, by the government of the Union\r\nor the States; but in this, as in every other department of liberal\r\nart and science, the great dependence,--and may I not add, the safe\r\ndependence?--as it ever has been, must continue to be upon the bounty of\r\nenlightened, liberal, and public-spirited individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE DUDLEY OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nIt is by a signal exercise of this bounty, my Friends, that we are\r\ncalled together to-day. The munificence of several citizens of this\r\nancient city, among whom the first place is due to the generous lady\r\nwhose name has with great propriety been given to the institution, has\r\nfurnished the means for the foundation of the Dudley Observatory at\r\nAlbany. On a commanding elevation on the northern edge of the city,\r\nliberally given for that purpose by the head of a family in which the\r\npatronage of science is hereditary, a building of ample dimensions has\r\nbeen erected, upon a plan which combines all the requisites of solidity,\r\nconvenience, and taste. A large portion of the expense of the structure\r\nhas been defrayed by Mrs. Blandina Dudley; to whose generosity, and that\r\nof several other public-spirited individuals, the institution is also\r\nindebted for the provision which has been made for an adequate supply of\r\nfirst-class instruments, to be executed by the most eminent makers in\r\nEurope and America; and which, it is confidently expected, will yield to\r\nnone of their class in any observatory in the world.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Prof. Loomis, in _Harper's Magazine_ for June, p. 49.]\r\n\r\nWith a liberal supply of instrumental power; established in a community\r\nto whose intelligence and generosity its support may be safely confided,\r\nand whose educational institutions are rapidly realizing the conception\r\nof a university; countenanced by the gentleman who conducts the United\r\nStates Coast Survey with such scientific skill and administrative\r\nenergy; committed to the immediate supervision of an astronomer to\r\nwhose distinguished talent had been added the advantage of a thorough\r\nscientific education in the most renowned universities of Europe, and\r\nwho, as the editor of the _American Astronomical Journal_, has shown\r\nhimself to be fully qualified for the high trust;--under these favorable\r\ncircumstances, the Dudley Observatory at Albany takes its place among\r\nthe scientific foundations of the country and the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WONDERS OF ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nIt is no affected modesty which leads me to express the regret that this\r\ninteresting occasion could not have taken place under somewhat different\r\nauspices. I feel that the duty of addressing this great and enlightened\r\nassembly, comprising so much of the intelligence of the community and of\r\nthe science of the country, ought to have been elsewhere assigned; that\r\nit should have devolved upon some one of the eminent persons, many of\r\nwhom I see before me, to whom you have been listening the past week,\r\nwho, as observers and geometers, could have treated the subject with a\r\nmaster's power; astronomers, whose telescopes have penetrated the depths\r\nof the heavens, or mathematicians, whose analysis unthreads the maze\r\nof their wondrous mechanism. If, instead of commanding, as you easily\r\ncould have done, qualifications of this kind, your choice has rather\r\nfallen on one making no pretensions to the honorable name of a man of\r\nscience,--but whose delight it has always been to turn aside from the\r\ndusty paths of active life, for an interval of recreation in the green\r\nfields of sacred nature in all her kingdoms,--it is, I presume, because\r\nyou have desired on an occasion of this kind, necessarily of a popular\r\ncharacter, that those views of the subject should be presented which\r\naddress themselves to the general intelligence of the community, and\r\nnot to its select scientific circles. There is, perhaps, no branch of\r\nscience which to the same extent as astronomy exhibits phenomena which,\r\nwhile they task the highest powers of philosophical research, are also\r\nwell adapted to arrest the attention of minds barely tinctured with\r\nscientific culture, and even to teach the sensibilities of the wholly\r\nuninstructed observer. The profound investigations of the chemist into\r\nthe ultimate constitution of material nature, the minute researches of\r\nthe physiologist into the secrets of animal life, the transcendental\r\nlogic of the geometer, clothed in a notation, the very sight of which\r\nterrifies the uninitiated,--are lost on the common understanding. But\r\nthe unspeakable glories of the rising and the setting sun; the serene\r\nmajesty of the moon, as she walks in full-orbed brightness through the\r\nheavens; the soft witchery of the morning and the evening star; the\r\nimperial splendors of the firmament on a bright, unclouded night; the\r\ncomet, whose streaming banner floats over half the sky,--these are\r\nobjects which charm and astonish alike the philosopher and the peasant,\r\nthe mathematician who weighs the masses and defines the orbits of the\r\nheavenly bodies, and the untutored observer who sees nothing beyond the\r\nimages painted upon the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WHAT IS AN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY?\r\n\r\nAn astronomical observatory, in the general acceptation of the word, is\r\na building erected for the reception and appropriate use of astronomical\r\ninstruments, and the accommodation of the men of science employed\r\nin making and reducing observations of the heavenly bodies. These\r\ninstruments are mainly of three classes, to which I believe all others\r\nof a strictly astronomical character may be referred.\r\n\r\n1. The instruments by which the heavens are inspected, with a view to\r\ndiscover the existence of those celestial bodies which are not visible\r\nto the naked eye (beyond all comparison more numerous than those which\r\nare), and the magnitude, shapes, and other sensible qualities, both of\r\nthose which are and those which are not thus visible to the unaided\r\nsight. The instruments of this class are designated by the general name\r\nof Telescope, and are of two kinds,--the refracting telescope, which\r\nderives its magnifying power from a system of convex lenses; and the\r\nreflecting telescope, which receives the image of the heavenly body upon\r\na concave mirror.\r\n\r\n2d. The second class of instruments consists of those which are designed\r\nprincipally to measure the angular distances of the heavenly bodies\r\nfrom each other, and their time of passing the meridian. The transit\r\ninstrument, the meridian circle, the mural circle, the heliometer,\r\nand the sextant, belong to this class. The brilliant discoveries\r\nof astronomy are, for the most part, made with the first class of\r\ninstruments; its practical results wrought out by the second.\r\n\r\n3d. The third class contains the clock, with its subsidiary apparatus,\r\nfor measuring the time and making its subdivisions with the greatest\r\npossible accuracy; indispensable auxiliary of all the instruments, by\r\nwhich the positions and motions of the heavenly bodies are observed, and\r\nmeasured, and recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe telescope may be likened to a wondrous cyclopean eye, endued with\r\nsuperhuman power, by which the astronomer extends the reach of his\r\nvision to the further heavens, and surveys galaxies and universes\r\ncompared with which the solar system is but an atom floating in the air.\r\nThe transit may be compared to the measuring rod which he lays from\r\nplanet to planet, and from star to star, to ascertain and mark off the\r\nheavenly spaces, and transfer them to his note-book; the clock is that\r\nmarvelous apparatus by which he equalizes and divides into nicely\r\nmeasured parts a portion of that unconceived infinity of duration,\r\nwithout beginning and without end, in which all existence floats as on a\r\nshoreless and bottomless sea.\r\n\r\nIn the contrivance and the execution of these instruments, the utmost\r\nstretch of inventive skill and mechanical ingenuity has been put forth.\r\nTo such perfection have they been carried, that a single second of\r\nmagnitude or space is rendered a distinctly visible and appreciable\r\nquantity. \"The arc of a circle,\" says Sir J. Herschell, \"subtended by\r\none second, is less than the 200,000th part of the radius, so that on a\r\ncircle of six feet in diameter, it would occupy no greater linear extent\r\nthan 1-5700 part of an inch, a quantity requiring a powerful microscope\r\nto be discerned at all.\"[A] The largest body in our system, the sun,\r\nwhose real diameter is 882,000 miles, subtends, at a distance of\r\n95,000,000 miles, but an angle of little more than 32; while so\r\nadmirably are the best instruments constructed, that both in Europe\r\nand America a satellite of Neptune, an object of comparatively\r\ninconsiderable diameter, has been discovered at a distance of 2,850\r\nmillions of miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Outlines_, § 131.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 UTILITY OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe object of an observatory, erected and supplied with instruments of\r\nthis admirable construction, and at proportionate expense, is, as I have\r\nalready intimated, to provide for an accurate and systematic survey\r\nof the heavenly bodies, with a view to a more correct and extensive\r\nacquaintance with those already known, and as instrumental power\r\nand skill in using it increase, to the discovery of bodies hitherto\r\ninvisible, and in both classes to the determination of their distances,\r\ntheir relations to each other, and the laws which govern their\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nWhy should we wish to obtain this knowledge? What inducement is there\r\nto expend large sums of money in the erection of observatories, and in\r\nfurnishing them with costly instruments, and in the support of the men\r\nof science employed in making, discussing, and recording, for successive\r\ngenerations, those minute observations of the heavenly bodies?\r\n\r\nIn an exclusively scientific treatment of this subject, an inquiry\r\ninto its utilitarian relations would be superfluous--even wearisome.\r\nBut on an occasion like the present, you will not, perhaps, think it\r\nout of place if I briefly answer the question, What is the use of an\r\nobservatory, and what benefit may be expected from the operations of\r\nsuch an establishment in a community like ours?\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, then, we derive from the observations of the\r\nheavenly bodies which are made at an observatory, our only adequate\r\nmeasures of time, and our only means of comparing the time of one\r\nplace with the time of another. Our artificial time-keepers--clocks,\r\nwatches, and chronometers--however ingeniously contrived and admirably\r\nfabricated, are but a transcript, so to say, of the celestial motions,\r\nand would be of no value without the means of regulating them by\r\nobservation. It is impossible for them, under any circumstances, to\r\nescape the imperfection of all machinery the work of human hands; and\r\nthe moment we remove with our time-keeper east or west, it fails us. It\r\nwill keep home time alone, like the fond traveler who leaves his heart\r\nbehind him. The artificial instrument is of incalculable utility, but\r\nmust itself be regulated by the eternal clock-work of the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n         RELATIONS BETWEEN NATURAL PHENOMENA AND DAILY LIFE.\r\n\r\nThis single consideration is sufficient to show how completely the daily\r\nbusiness of life is affected and controlled by the heavenly bodies.\r\nIt is they--and not our main-springs, our expansion balances, and our\r\ncompensation pendulums--which give us our time. To reverse the line of\r\nPope:\r\n\r\n            \"'Tis with our watches as our judgments;--none\r\n              Go just alike, but each believes his own.\"\r\n\r\nBut for all the kindreds and tribes and tongues of men--each upon their\r\nown meridian--from the Arctic pole to the equator, from the equator to\r\nthe Antarctic pole, the eternal sun strikes twelve at noon, and the\r\nglorious constellations, far up in the everlasting belfries of the\r\nskies, chime twelve at midnight;--twelve for the pale student over his\r\nflickering lamp; twelve amid the flaming glories of Orion's belt, if he\r\ncrosses the meridian at that fated hour; twelve by the weary couch of\r\nlanguishing humanity; twelve in the star-paved courts of the Empyrean;\r\ntwelve for the heaving tides of the ocean; twelve for the weary arm of\r\nlabor; twelve for the toiling brain; twelve for the watching, waking,\r\nbroken heart; twelve for the meteor which blazes for a moment and\r\nexpires; twelve for the comet whose period is measured by centuries;\r\ntwelve for every substantial, for every imaginary thing, which exists in\r\nthe sense, the intellect, or the fancy, and which the speech or thought\r\nof man, at the given meridian, refers to the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nNot only do we resort to the observation of the heavenly bodies for the\r\nmeans of regulating and rectifying our clocks, but the great divisions\r\nof day and month and year are derived from the same source. By the\r\nconstitution of our nature, the elements of our existence are closely\r\nconnected with celestial times. Partly by his physical organization,\r\npartly by the experience of the race from the dawn of creation, man as\r\nhe is, and the times and seasons of the heavenly bodies, are part and\r\nparcel of one system. The first great division of time, the day-night\r\n(nychthemerum), for which we have no precise synonym in our language,\r\nwith its primal alternation of waking and sleeping, of labor and rest,\r\nis a vital condition of the existence of such a creature as man. The\r\nrevolution of the year, with its various incidents of summer and winter,\r\nand seed-time and harvest, is not less involved in our social, material,\r\nand moral progress. It is true that at the poles, and on the equator,\r\nthe effects of these revolutions are variously modified or wholly\r\ndisappear; but as the necessary consequence, human life is extinguished\r\nat the poles, and on the equator attains only a languid or feverish\r\ndevelopment. Those latitudes only in which the great motions and\r\ncardinal positions of the earth exert a mean influence, exhibit man in\r\nthe harmonious expansion of his powers. The lunar period, which lies\r\nat the foundation of the _month_, is less vitally connected with human\r\nexistence and development; but is proved by the experience of every age\r\nand race to be eminently conducive to the progress of civilization and\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nBut indispensable as are these heavenly measures of time to our life and\r\nprogress, and obvious as are the phenomena on which they rest, yet owing\r\nto the circumstance that, in the economy of nature, the day, the month,\r\nand the year are not exactly commensurable, some of the most difficult\r\nquestions in practical astronomy are those by which an accurate division\r\nof time, applicable to the various uses of life, is derived from the\r\nobservation of the heavenly bodies. I have no doubt that, to the Supreme\r\nIntelligence which created and rules the universe, there is a harmony\r\nhidden to us in the numerical relation to each other of days, months,\r\nand years; but in our ignorance of that harmony, their practical\r\nadjustment to each other is a work of difficulty. The great\r\nembarrassment which attended the reformation of the calendar, after the\r\nerror of the Julian period had, in the lapse of centuries, reached ten\r\n(or rather twelve) days, sufficiently illustrates this remark. It is\r\nmost true that scientific difficulties did not form the chief obstacle.\r\nHaving been proposed under the auspices of the Roman pontiff, the\r\nProtestant world, for a century and more, rejected the new style.\r\nIt was in various places the subject of controversy, collision, and\r\nbloodshed.[A] It was not adopted in England till nearly two centuries\r\nafter its introduction at Rome; and in the country of Struve and the\r\nPulkova equatorial, they persist at the present day in adding eleven\r\nminutes and twelve seconds to the length of the tropical year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Stern's \"_Himmelskunde_,\" p. 72.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n2. The second great practical use of an Astronomical Observatory is\r\nconnected with the science of geography. The first page of the history\r\nof our Continent declares this truth. Profound meditation on the\r\nsphericity of the earth was one of the main reasons which led Columbus\r\nto undertake his momentous voyage; and his thorough acquaintance with\r\nthe astronomical science of that day was, in his own judgment, what\r\nenabled him to overcome the almost innumerable obstacles which attended\r\nits prosecution.[A] In return, I find that Copernicus in the very\r\ncommencement of his immortal work _De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium_,\r\nfol. 2, appeals to the discovery of America as completing the\r\ndemonstration of the sphericity of the earth. Much of our knowledge of\r\nthe figure, size, density, and position of the earth, as a member of\r\nthe solar system, is derived from this science; and it furnishes us\r\nthe means of performing the most important operations of practical\r\ngeography. Latitude and longitude, which lie at the basis of all\r\ndescriptive geography, are determined by observation. No map deserves\r\nthe name, on which the position of important points has not been\r\nastronomically determined. Some even of our most important political and\r\nadministrative arrangements depend upon the coöperation of this science.\r\nAmong these I may mention the land system of the United States, and the\r\ndetermination of the boundaries of the country. I believe that till it\r\nwas done by the Federal Government, a uniform system of mathematical\r\nsurvey had never in any country been applied to an extensive territory.\r\nLarge grants and sales of public land took place before the Revolution,\r\nand in the interval between the peace and the adoption of the\r\nConstitution; but the limits of these grants and sales were ascertained\r\nby sensible objects, by trees, streams, rocks, hills, and by reference\r\nto adjacent portions of territory, previously surveyed. The uncertainty\r\nof boundaries thus defined, was a never-failing source of litigation.\r\nLarge tracts of land in the Western country, granted by Virginia\r\nunder this old system of special and local survey, were covered with\r\nconflicting claims; and the controversies to which they gave rise\r\nformed no small part of the business of the Federal Court after its\r\norganization. But the adoption of the present land-system brought order\r\nout of chaos. The entire public domain is now scientifically surveyed\r\nbefore it is offered for sale; it is laid off into ranges, townships,\r\nsections, and smaller divisions, with unerring accuracy, resting on the\r\nfoundation of base and meridian lines; and I have been informed that\r\nunder this system, scarce a case of contested location and boundary has\r\never presented itself in court. The General Land Office contains maps\r\nand plans, in which every quarter-section of the public land is laid\r\ndown with mathematical precision. The superficies of half a continent is\r\nthus transferred in miniature to the bureaus of Washington; while the\r\nlocal Land Offices contain transcripts of these plans, copies of which\r\nare furnished to the individual purchaser. When we consider the tide of\r\npopulation annually flowing into the public domain, and the immense\r\nimportance of its efficient and economical administration, the utility\r\nof this application of Astronomy will be duly estimated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Humboldt, _Histotre de la Geographie_, &c., Tom. 1,\r\npage 71.]\r\n\r\nI will here venture to repeat an anecdote, which I heard lately from\r\na son of the late Hon. Timothy Pickering. Mr. Octavius Pickering, on\r\nbehalf of his father, had applied to Mr. David Putnam of Marietta, to\r\nact as his legal adviser, with respect to certain land claims in the\r\nVirginia Military district, in the State of Ohio. Mr. Putnam declined\r\nthe agency. He had had much to do with business of that kind, and found\r\nit beset with endless litigation. \"I have never,\" he added, \"succeeded\r\nbut in a single case, and that was a location and survey made by General\r\nWashington before the Revolution; and I am not acquainted with any\r\nsurveys, except those made by him, but what have been litigated.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a most important survey of the coast of the United\r\nStates is in progress, an operation of the utmost consequence, in\r\nreference to the commerce, navigation, and hydrography of the country.\r\nThe entire work, I need scarce say, is one of practical astronomy. The\r\nscientific establishment which we this day inaugurate is looked to for\r\nimportant coöperation in this great undertaking, and will no doubt\r\ncontribute efficiently to its prosecution.\r\n\r\nAstronomical observation furnishes by far the best means of defining the\r\nboundaries of States, especially when the lines are of great length and\r\nrun through unsettled countries. Natural indications, like rivers and\r\nmountains, however indistinct in appearance, are in practice subject to\r\nunavoidable error. By the treaty of 1783, a boundary was established\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain, depending chiefly on the\r\ncourse of rivers and highlands dividing the waters which flow into the\r\nAtlantic Ocean from those which flow into the St. Lawrence. It took\r\ntwenty years to find out which river was the true St. Croix, that being\r\nthe starting point. England then having made the extraordinary discovery\r\nthat the Bay of Fundy is not a part of the Atlantic Ocean, forty years\r\nmore were passed in the unsuccessful attempt to re-create the highlands\r\nwhich this strange theory had annihilated; and just as the two countries\r\nwere on the verge of a war, the controversy was settled by compromise.\r\nHad the boundary been accurately described by lines of latitude and\r\nlongitude, no dispute could have arisen. No dispute arose as to the\r\nboundary between the United States and Spain, and her successor, Mexico,\r\nwhere it runs through untrodden deserts and over pathless mountains\r\nalong the 42d degree of latitude. The identity of rivers may be\r\ndisputed, as in the case of the St. Croix; the course of mountain chains\r\nis too broad for a dividing line; the division of streams, as experience\r\nhas shown, is uncertain; but a degree of latitude is written on the\r\nheavenly sphere, and nothing but an observation is required to read the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         QUESTIONS OF BOUNDARY.\r\n\r\nBut scientific elements, like sharp instruments, must be handled with\r\nscientific accuracy. A part of our boundary between the British\r\nProvinces ran upon the forty-fifth degree of latitude; and about forty\r\nyears ago, an expensive fortress was commenced by the government of the\r\nUnited States, at Rouse's Point, on Lake Champlain, on a spot intended\r\nto be just within our limits. When a line came to be more carefully\r\nsurveyed, the fortress turned out to be on the wrong side of the line;\r\nwe had been building an expensive fortification for our neighbor. But in\r\nthe general compromises of the Treaty of Washington by the Webster and\r\nAshburton Treaty in 1842, the fortification was left within our\r\nlimits.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Webster's Works. Vol. V., 110, 115.]\r\n\r\nErrors still more serious had nearly resulted, a few years since, in\r\na war with Mexico. By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in 1848, the\r\nboundary line between the United States and that country was in part\r\ndescribed by reference to the town of El Paso, as laid down on a\r\nspecified map of the United States, of which a copy was appended to the\r\ntreaty. This boundary was to be surveyed and run by a joint commission\r\nof men of science. It soon appeared that errors of two or three degrees\r\nexisted in the projection of the map. Its lines of latitude and\r\nlongitude did not conform to the topography of the region; so that it\r\nbecame impossible to execute the text of the treaty. The famous Mesilla\r\nValley was a part of the debatable ground; and the sum of $10,000,000,\r\npaid to the Mexican Government for that and for an additional strip of\r\nterritory on the southwest, was the smart-money which expiated the\r\ninaccuracy of the map--the necessary result, perhaps, of the want of\r\ngood materials for its construction.\r\n\r\nIt became my official duty in London, a few years ago, to apply to\r\nthe British Government for an authentic statement of their claim to\r\njurisdiction over New Zealand. The official _Gazette_ for the 2d of\r\nOctober, 1840, was sent me from the Foreign Office, as affording the\r\ndesired information. This number of the _Gazette_ contained the\r\nproclamations issued by the Lieutenant Governor of New Zealand, \"in\r\npursuance of the instructions he received from the Marquis of Normanby,\r\none of Her Majesty's principal Secretaries of State,\" asserting the\r\njurisdiction of his government over the islands of New Zealand, and\r\ndeclaring them to extend \"from 34° 30' North to 47° 10' South latitude.\"\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that south latitude was intended in both\r\ninstances. This error of 69° of latitude, which would have extended the\r\nclaim of British jurisdiction over the whole breadth of the Pacific,\r\nhad, apparently, escaped the notice of that government.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply illustrations in proof of the great\r\npractical importance of accurate scientific designations, drawn from\r\nastronomical observations, in various relations connected with\r\nboundaries, surveys, and other geographical purposes; but I must hasten\r\nto\r\n\r\n3. A third important department, in which the services rendered by\r\nastronomy are equally conspicuous. I refer to commerce and navigation.\r\nIt is mainly owing to the results of astronomical observation, that\r\nmodern commerce has attained such a vast expansion, compared with that\r\nof the ancient world. I have already reminded you that accurate ideas\r\nin this respect contributed materially to the conception in the mind\r\nof Columbus of his immortal enterprise, and to the practical success\r\nwith which it was conducted. It was mainly his skill in the use of\r\nastronomical instruments--imperfect as they were--which enabled him, in\r\nspite of the bewildering variation of the compass, to find his way\r\nacross the ocean.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of the true system of the universe toward general\r\nadoption, the problem of finding the longitude at sea presented itself.\r\nThis was the avowed object of the foundation of the observatory at\r\nGreenwich;[A] and no one subject has received more of the attention of\r\nastronomers, than those investigations of the lunar theory on which\r\nthe requisite tables of the navigator are founded. The pathways of the\r\nocean are marked out in the sky above. The eternal lights of the heavens\r\nare the only Pharos whose beams never fail, which no tempest can shake\r\nfrom its foundation. Within my recollection, it was deemed a necessary\r\nqualification for the master and the mate of a merchant-ship, and even\r\nfor a prime hand, to be able to \"work a lunar,\" as it was called. The\r\nimprovements in the chronometer have in practice, to a great extent,\r\nsuperseded this laborious operation; but observation remains,\r\nand unquestionably will for ever remain, the only dependence for\r\nascertaining the ship's time and deducting the longitude from the\r\ncomparison of that time with the chronometer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Grant's _Physical Astronomy_, p. 460.]\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be thought that astronomical science is brought already\r\nto such a state of perfection that nothing more is to be desired, or at\r\nleast that nothing more is attainable, in reference to such practicable\r\napplications as I have described. This, however, is an idea which\r\ngenerous minds will reject, in this, as in every other department of\r\nhuman knowledge. In astronomy, as in every thing else, the discoveries\r\nalready made, theoretical or practical, instead of exhausting the\r\nscience, or putting a limit to its advancement, do but furnish the means\r\nand instruments of further progress. I have no doubt we live on the\r\nverge of discoveries and inventions, in every department, as brilliant\r\nas any that have ever been made; that there are new truths, new facts,\r\nready to start into recognition on every side; and it seems to me there\r\nnever was an age, since the dawn of time, when men ought to be less\r\ndisposed to rest satisfied with the progress already made, than the age\r\nin which we live; for there never was an age more distinguished for\r\ningenious research, for novel result, and bold generalization.\r\n\r\nThat no further improvement is desirable in the means and methods of\r\nascertaining the ship's place at sea, no one I think will from\r\nexperience be disposed to assert. The last time I crossed the Atlantic,\r\nI walked the quarter-deck with the officer in charge of the noble\r\nvessel, on one occasion, when we were driving along before a leading\r\nbreeze and under a head of steam, beneath a starless sky at midnight, at\r\nthe rate certainly of ten or eleven miles an hour. There is something\r\nsublime, but approaching the terrible, in such a scene;--the rayless\r\ngloom, the midnight chill,--the awful swell of the deep,--the dismal\r\nmoan of the wind through the rigging, the all but volcanic fires within\r\nthe hold of the ship. I scarce know an occasion in ordinary life in\r\nwhich a reflecting mind feels more keenly its hopeless dependence on\r\nirrational forces beyond its own control. I asked my companion how\r\nnearly he could determine his ship's place at sea under favorable\r\ncircumstances. Theoretically, he answered, I think, within a\r\nmile;--practically and usually within three or four. My next question\r\nwas, how near do you think we may be to Cape Race;--that dangerous\r\nheadland which pushes its iron-bound unlighted bastions from the\r\nshore of Newfoundland far into the Atlantic,--first landfall to\r\nthe homeward-bound American vessel. We must, said he, by our last\r\nobservations and reckoning, be within three or four miles of Cape Race.\r\nA comparison of these two remarks, under the circumstances in which we\r\nwere placed at the moment, brought my mind to the conclusion, that it is\r\ngreatly to be wished that the means should be discovered of finding the\r\nship's place more accurately, or that navigators would give Cape Race a\r\nlittle wider berth. But I do not remember that one of the steam packets\r\nbetween England and America was ever lost on that formidable point.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me by no means unlikely that, with the improvement of\r\ninstrumental power, and of the means of ascertaining the ship's time\r\nwith exactness, as great an advance beyond the present state of art and\r\nscience in finding a ship's place at sea may take place, as was effected\r\nby the invention of the reflecting quadrant, the calculation of lunar\r\ntables, and the improved construction of chronometers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BABBAGE'S DIFFERENCE MACHINE.\r\n\r\nIn the wonderful versatility of the human mind, the improvement, when\r\nmade, will very probably be made by paths where it is least expected.\r\nThe great inducement to Mr. Babbage to attempt the construction of an\r\nengine by which astronomical tables could be calculated, and even\r\nprinted, by mechanical means and with entire accuracy, was the errors\r\nin the requisite tables. Nineteen such errors, in point of fact, were\r\ndiscovered in an edition of Taylor's Logarithms printed in 1796; some\r\nof which might have led to the most dangerous results in calculating a\r\nship's place. These nineteen errors, (of which one only was an error of\r\nthe press), were pointed out in the _Nautical Almanac_ for 1832. In one\r\nof these _errata_ the seat of the error was stated to be in cosine of\r\n14° 18' 3\". Subsequent examination showed that there was an error of one\r\nsecond in this correction; and, accordingly, in the _Nautical Almanac_\r\nof the next year a new correction was necessary. But in making the new\r\ncorrection of one second, a new error was committed of ten degrees.\r\nInstead of cosine 14° 18' 2\" the correction was printed cosine 4° 18' 2\"\r\nmaking it still necessary, in some future edition of the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_, to insert an _erratum_ in an _erratum_ of the _errata_ in\r\nTaylor's logarithms.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Edinburgh Review, Vol. LIX., 282.]\r\n\r\nIn the hope of obviating the possibility of such errors, Mr. Babbage\r\nprojected his calculating, or, as he prefers to call it, his difference\r\nmachine. Although this extraordinary undertaking has been arrested, in\r\nconsequence of the enormous expense attending its execution, enough has\r\nbeen achieved to show the mechanical possibility of constructing an\r\nengine of this kind, and even one of far higher powers, of which Mr.\r\nBabbage has matured the conception, devised the notation, and executed\r\nthe drawings--themselves an imperishable monument of the genius of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nI happened on one occasion to be in company with this highly\r\ndistinguished man of science, whose social qualities are as pleasing as\r\nhis constructive talent is marvelous, when another eminent _savant_,\r\nCount Strzelecki, just returned from his Oriental and Australian tour,\r\nobserved that he found among the Chinese, a great desire to know\r\nsomething more of Mr. Babbage's calculating machine, and especially\r\nwhether, like their own _swampan_, it could be made to go into the\r\npocket. Mr. Babbage good-humouredly observed that, thus far, he had been\r\nvery much out of pocket with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n               INCREASED COMMAND OF INSTRUMENTAL POWER.\r\n\r\nWhatever advances may be made in astronomical science, theoretical\r\nor applied, I am strongly inclined to think that they will be made\r\nin connection with an increased command of instrumental power. The\r\nnatural order in which the human mind proceeds in the acquisition\r\nof astronomical knowledge is minute and accurate observation of the\r\nphenomena of the heavens, the skillful discussion and analysis of these\r\nobservations, and sound philosophy in generalizing the results.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this course, however, a difficulty presented itself, which\r\nfor ages proved insuperable--and which to the same extent has existed\r\nin no other science, viz.: that all the leading phenomena are in their\r\nappearance delusive. It is indeed true that in all sciences superficial\r\nobservation can only lead, except by chance, to superficial knowledge;\r\nbut I know of no branch in which, to the same degree as in astronomy,\r\nthe great leading phenomena are the reverse of true; while they yet\r\nappeal so strongly to the senses, that men who could foretell eclipses,\r\nand who discovered the precession of the equinoxes, still believed that\r\nthe earth was at rest in the center of the universe, and that all the\r\nhost of heaven performed a daily revolution about it as a center.\r\n\r\nIt usually happens in scientific progress, that when a great fact is at\r\nlength discovered, it approves itself at once to all competent judges.\r\nIt furnishes a solution to so many problems, and harmonizes with so many\r\nother facts,--that all the other _data_ as it were crystallize at once\r\nabout it. In modern times, we have often witnessed such an impatience,\r\nso to say, of great truths, to be discovered, that it has frequently\r\nhappened that they have been found out simultaneously by more than one\r\nindividual; and a disputed question of priority is an event of very\r\ncommon occurrence. Not so with the true theory of the heavens. So\r\ncomplete is the deception practiced on the senses, that it failed more\r\nthan once to yield to the suggestion of the truth; and it was only when\r\nthe visual organs were armed with an almost preternatural instrumental\r\npower, that the great fact found admission to the human mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COPERNICAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that in the very dawn of science, Pythagoras or his\r\ndisciples explained the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies about\r\nthe earth by the diurnal revolution of the earth on its axis. But this\r\ntheory, though bearing so deeply impressed upon it the great seal of\r\ntruth, _simplicity_, was in such glaring contrast with the evidence of\r\nthe senses, that it failed of acceptance in antiquity or the middle\r\nages. It found no favor with minds like those of Aristotle, Archimedes,\r\nHipparchus, Ptolemy, or any of the acute and learned Arabian or mediæval\r\nastronomers. All their ingenuity and all their mathematical skill were\r\nexhausted in the development of a wonderfully complicated and ingenious,\r\nbut erroneous history. The great master truth, rejected for its\r\nsimplicity, lay disregarded at their feet.\r\n\r\nAt the second dawn of science, the great fact again beamed into the mind\r\nof Copernicus. Now, at least, in that glorious age which witnessed the\r\ninvention of printing, the great mechanical engine of intellectual\r\nprogress, and the discovery of America, we may expect that this\r\nlong-hidden revelation, a second time proclaimed, will command the\r\nassent of mankind. But the sensible phenomena were still too strong\r\nfor the theory; the glorious delusion of the rising and the setting\r\nsun could not be overcome. Tycho de Brahe furnished his Observatory\r\nwith instruments superior in number and quality to all that had been\r\ncollected before; but the great instrument of discovery, which, by\r\naugmenting the optic power of the eye, enables it to penetrate beyond\r\nthe apparent phenomena, and to discern the true constitution of the\r\nheavenly bodies, was wanting at Uranienburg. The observations of Tycho\r\nas discussed by Kepler, conducted that most fervid, powerful, and\r\nsagacious mind to the discovery of some of the most important laws of\r\nthe celestial motions; but it was not till Galileo, at Florence, had\r\npointed his telescope to the sky, that the Copernican system could be\r\nsaid to be firmly established in the scientific world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE HOME OF GALILEO.\r\n\r\nOn this great name, my Friends, assembled as we are to dedicate a temple\r\nto instrumental Astronomy, we may well pause for a moment.\r\n\r\nThere is much, in every way, in the city of Florence to excite the\r\ncuriosity, to kindle the imagination, and to gratify the taste.\r\nSheltered on the north by the vine-clad hills of Fiesoli, whose\r\ncyclopean walls carry back the antiquary to ages before the Roman,\r\nbefore the Etruscan power, the flowery city (Fiorenza) covers the sunny\r\nbanks of the Arno with its stately palaces. Dark and frowning piles\r\nof mediæval structure; a majestic dome, the prototype of St. Peter's;\r\nbasilicas which enshrine the ashes of some of the mightiest of the dead;\r\nthe stone where Dante stood to gaze on the Campanile; the house of\r\nMichael Angelo, still occupied by a descendant of his lineage and name,\r\nhis hammer, his chisel, his dividers, his manuscript poems, all as if\r\nhe had left them but yesterday; airy bridges, which seem not so much to\r\nrest on the earth as to hover over the waters they span; the loveliest\r\ncreations of ancient art, rescued from the grave of ages again to\r\nenchant the world; the breathing marbles of Michael Angelo, the glowing\r\ncanvas of Raphael and Titian, museums filled with medals and coins of\r\nevery age from Cyrus the younger, and gems and amulets and vases from\r\nthe sepulchers of Egyptian Pharaohs coëval with Joseph, and Etruscan\r\nLucumons that swayed Italy before the Romans,--libraries stored with the\r\nchoicest texts of ancient literature,--gardens of rose and orange,\r\nand pomegranate, and myrtle,--the very air you breathe languid with\r\nmusic and perfume;--such is Florence. But among all its fascinations,\r\naddressed to the sense, the memory, and the heart, there was none\r\nto which I more frequently gave a meditative hour during a year's\r\nresidence, than to the spot where Galileo Galilei sleeps beneath the\r\nmarble door of Santa Croce; no building on which I gazed with greater\r\nreverence, than I did upon the modest mansion at Arcetri, villa at once\r\nand prison, in which that venerable sage, by command of the Inquisition,\r\npassed the sad closing years of his life. The beloved daughter on whom\r\nhe had depended to smooth his passage to the grave, laid there before\r\nhim; the eyes with which he had discovered worlds before unknown,\r\nquenched in blindness:\r\n\r\n               Ahime! quegli occhi si son fatti oscuri,\r\n               Che vider più di tutti i tempi antichi,\r\n               E luce fur dei secoli futuri.\r\n\r\nThat was the house, \"where,\" says Milton (another of those of whom the\r\nworld was not worthy), \"I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown\r\nold--a prisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking on astronomy otherwise\r\nthan as the Dominican and Franciscan licensers thought.\"[A] Great\r\nHeavens! what a tribunal, what a culprit, what a crime! Let us thank\r\nGod, my Friends, that we live in the nineteenth century. Of all the\r\nwonders of ancient and modern art, statues and paintings, and jewels and\r\nmanuscripts,--the admiration and the delight of ages,--there was nothing\r\nwhich I beheld with more affectionate awe than that poor, rough tube,\r\na few feet in length,--the work of his own hands,--that very \"optic\r\nglass,\" through which the \"Tuscan Artist\" viewed the moon,\r\n\r\n              \"At evening, from the top of Fesolé,\r\n               Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,\r\n               Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.\"\r\n\r\nthat poor little spy-glass (for it is scarcely more) through which\r\nthe human eye first distinctly beheld the surface of the moon--first\r\ndiscovered the phases of Venus, the satellites of Jupiter, and the\r\nseeming handles of Saturn--first penetrated the dusky depths of the\r\nheavens--first pierced the clouds of visual error, which, from the\r\ncreation of the world, involved the system of the Universe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Prose Works, vol. 1, p. 213.]\r\n\r\nThere are occasions in life in which a great mind lives years of rapt\r\nenjoyment in a moment. I can fancy the emotions of Galileo, when, first\r\nraising the newly-constructed telescope to the heavens, he saw fulfilled\r\nthe grand prophecy of Copernicus, and beheld the planet Venus crescent\r\nlike the moon. It was such another moment as that when the immortal\r\nprinters of Mentz and Strasburg received the first copy of the Bible\r\ninto their hands, the work of their divine art; like that when Columbus,\r\nthrough the gray dawn of the 12th of October, 1492 (Copernicus, at the\r\nage of eighteen, was then a student at Cracow), beheld the shores of San\r\nSalvador; like that when the law of gravitation first revealed itself to\r\nthe intellect of Newton; like that when Franklin saw by the stiffening\r\nfibers of the hempen cord of his kite, that he held the lightning in his\r\ngrasp; like that when Leverrier received back from Berlin the tidings\r\nthat the predicted planet was found.\r\n\r\nYes, noble Galileo, thou art right, _E pur si muove._ \"It does move.\"\r\nBigots may make thee recant it; but it moves, nevertheless. Yes, the\r\nearth moves, and the planets move, and the mighty waters move, and the\r\ngreat sweeping tides of air move, and the empires of men move, and the\r\nworld of thought moves, ever onward and upward to higher facts and\r\nbolder theories. The Inquisition may seal thy lips, but they can no more\r\nstop the progress of the great truth propounded by Copernicus, and\r\ndemonstrated by thee, than they can stop the revolving earth.\r\n\r\nClose now, venerable sage, that sightless, tearful eye; it has seen\r\nwhat man never before saw--it has seen enough. Hang up that poor\r\nlittle spy-glass--it has done its work. Not Herschell nor Rosse have,\r\ncomparatively, done more. Franciscans and Dominicans deride thy\r\ndiscoveries now; but the time will come when, from two hundred\r\nobservatories in Europe and America, the glorious artillery of science\r\nshall nightly assault the skies, but they shall gain no conquests in\r\nthose glittering fields before which thine shall be forgotten. Rest in\r\npeace, great Columbus of the heavens--like him scorned, persecuted,\r\nbroken-hearted!--in other ages, in distant hemispheres, when the\r\nvotaries of science, with solemn acts of consecration, shall dedicate\r\ntheir stately edifices to the cause of knowledge and truth, thy name\r\nshall be mentioned with honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 NEW PERIODS IN ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, in dwelling with such emphasis upon the\r\ninvention of the telescope, to ascribe undue importance, in promoting\r\nthe advancement of science, to the increase of instrumental power.\r\nToo much, indeed, cannot be said of the service rendered by its\r\nfirst application in confirming and bringing into general repute the\r\nCopernican system; but for a considerable time, little more was effected\r\nby the wondrous instrument than the gratification of curiosity and\r\ntaste, by the inspection of the planetary phases, and the addition\r\nof the rings and satellites of Saturn to the solar family. Newton,\r\nprematurely despairing of any further improvement in the refracting\r\ntelescope, applied the principle of reflection; and the nicer\r\nobservations now made, no doubt, hastened the maturity of his great\r\ndiscovery of the law of gravitation; but that discovery was the work of\r\nhis transcendent genius and consummate skill.\r\n\r\nWith Bradley, in 1741, a new period commenced in instrumental astronomy,\r\nnot so much of discovery as of measurement. The superior accuracy and\r\nminuteness with which the motions and distances of the heavenly bodies\r\nwere now observed, resulted in the accumulation of a mass of new\r\nmaterials, both for tabular comparison and theoretical speculation.\r\nThese materials formed the enlarged basis of astronomical science\r\nbetween Newton and Sir William Herschell. His gigantic reflectors\r\nintroduced the astronomer to regions of space before unvisited--extended\r\nbeyond all previous conception the range of the observed phenomena, and\r\nwith it proportionably enlarged the range of constructive theory. The\r\ndiscovery of a new primary planet and its attendant satellites was\r\nbut the first step of his progress into the labyrinth of the heavens.\r\nCotemporaneously with his observations, the French astronomers, and\r\nespecially La Place, with a geometrical skill scarcely, if at all,\r\ninferior to that of its great author, resumed the whole system of\r\nNewton, and brought every phenomenon observed since his time within his\r\nlaws. Difficulties of fact, with which he struggled in vain, gave way to\r\nmore accurate observations; and problems that defied the power of his\r\nanalysis, yielded to the modern improvements of the calculus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HERSCHELL'S NEBULAR THEORY.\r\n\r\nBut there is no _Ultima Thule_ in the progress of science. With the\r\nrecent augmentations of telescopic power, the details of the nebular\r\ntheory, proposed by Sir W. Herschell with such courage and ingenuity,\r\nhave been drawn in question. Many--most--of those milky patches in which\r\nhe beheld what he regarded as cosmical matter, as yet in an unformed\r\nstate,--the rudimental material of worlds not yet condensed,--have been\r\nresolved into stars, as bright and distinct as any in the firmament.\r\nI well recall the glow of satisfaction with which, on the 22d of\r\nSeptember, 1847, being then connected with the University at Cambridge,\r\nI received a letter from the venerable director of the Observatory\r\nthere, beginning with these memorable words:--\"You will rejoice with\r\nme that the great nebula in Orion has yielded to the powers of our\r\nincomparable telescope! * * * It should be borne in mind that this\r\nnebula, and that of Andromeda [which has been also resolved at\r\nCambridge], are the last strongholds of the nebular theory.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Annals of the Observatory of Harvard College_, p. 121.]\r\n\r\nBut if some of the adventurous speculations built by Sir William\r\nHerschell on the bewildering revelations of his telescope have been\r\nsince questioned, the vast progress which has been made in sidereal\r\nastronomy, to which, as I understand, the Dudley Observatory will be\r\nparticularly devoted, the discovery of the parallax of the fixed stars,\r\nthe investigation of the interior relations of binary and triple systems\r\nof stars, the theories for the explanation of the extraordinary, not to\r\nsay fantastic, shapes discerned in some of the nebulous systems--whirls\r\nand spirals radiating through spaces as vast as the orbit of Neptune;[A]\r\nthe glimpses at systems beyond that to which our sun belongs;--these are\r\nall splendid results, which may fairly be attributed to the school of\r\nHerschell, and will for ever insure no secondary place to that name in\r\nthe annals of science.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: See the remarkable memoir of Professor Alexander, \"On the\r\norigin of the forms and the present condition of some of the clusters of\r\nstars, and several of the nebulæ,\" (Gould's _Astronomical Journal_, Vol.\r\niii, p. 95.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   RELATIONSHIP OF THE LIBERAL ARTS.\r\n\r\nIn the remarks which I have hitherto made, I have had mainly in view\r\nthe direct connection of astronomical science with the uses of life and\r\nthe service of man. But a generous philosophy contemplates the subject\r\nin higher relations. It is a remark as old, at least, as Plato, and\r\nis repeated from him more than once by Cicero, that all the liberal\r\narts have a common bond and relationship.[A] The different sciences\r\ncontemplate as their immediate object the different departments of\r\nanimate and inanimate nature; but this great system itself is but\r\none, and its parts are so interwoven with each other, that the most\r\nextraordinary relations and unexpected analogies are constantly\r\npresenting themselves; and arts and sciences seemingly the least\r\nconnected, render to each other the most effective assistance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Archias, i.; De Oratore, iii., 21.]\r\n\r\nThe history of electricity, galvanism, and magnetism, furnishes the most\r\nstriking illustration of this remark. Commencing with the meteorological\r\nphenomena of our own atmosphere, and terminating with the observation\r\nof the remotest heavens, it may well be adduced, on an occasion like\r\nthe present. Franklin demonstrated the identity of lightning and the\r\nelectric fluid. This discovery gave a great impulse to electrical\r\nresearch, with little else in view but the means of protection from\r\nthe thunder-cloud. A purely accidental circumstance led the physician\r\nGalvani, at Bologna, to trace the mysterious element, under conditions\r\nentirely novel, both of development and application. In this new form it\r\nbecame, in the hands of Davy, the instrument of the most extraordinary\r\nchemical operations; and earths and alkalis, touched by the creative\r\nwire, started up into metals that float on water, and kindle in the\r\nair. At a later period, the closest affinities are observed between\r\nelectricity and magnetism, on the one hand; while, on the other, the\r\nrelations of polarity are detected between acids and alkalis. Plating\r\nand gilding henceforth become electrical processes. In the last\r\napplications of the same subtle medium, it has become the messenger of\r\nintelligence across the land and beneath the sea; and is now employed by\r\nthe astronomer to ascertain the difference of longitudes, to transfer\r\nthe beats of the clock from one station to another, and to record the\r\nmoment of his observations with automatic accuracy. How large a share\r\nhas been borne by America in these magnificent discoveries and\r\napplications, among the most brilliant achievements of modern science,\r\nwill sufficiently appear from the repetition of the names of Franklin,\r\nHenry, Morse, Walker, Mitchell, Lock, and Bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VERSATILITY OF GENIUS.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes happened, whether from the harmonious relations to\r\neach other of every department of science, or from rare felicity of\r\nindividual genius, that the most extraordinary intellectual versatility\r\nhas been manifested by the same person. Although Newton's transcendent\r\ntalent did not blaze out in childhood, yet as a boy he discovered great\r\naptitude for mechanical contrivance. His water-clock, self-moving\r\nvehicle, and mill, were the wonder of the village; the latter propelled\r\nby a living mouse. Sir David Brewster represents the accounts as\r\ndiffering, whether the mouse was made to advance \"by a string attached\r\nto its tail,\" or by \"its unavailing attempts to reach a portion of corn\r\nplaced above the wheel.\" It seems more reasonable to conclude that\r\nthe youthful discoverer of the law of gravitation intended by the\r\ncombination of these opposite attractions to produce a balanced\r\nmovement. It is consoling to the average mediocrity of the race to\r\nperceive in these sportive assays, that the mind of Newton passed\r\nthrough the stage of boyhood. But emerging from boyhood, what a bound it\r\nmade, as from earth to heaven! Hardly commencing bachelor of arts, at\r\nthe age of twenty-four, he untwisted the golden and silver threads of\r\nthe solar spectrum, simultaneously or soon after conceived the method of\r\nfluxions, and arrived at the elemental idea of universal gravity before\r\nhe had passed to his master's degree. Master of Arts indeed! That\r\ndegree, if no other, was well bestowed. Universities are unjustly\r\naccused of fixing science in stereotype. That diploma is enough of\r\nitself to redeem the honors of academical parchment from centuries of\r\nlearned dullness and scholastic dogmatism.\r\n\r\nBut the great object of all knowledge is to enlarge and purify the soul,\r\nto fill the mind with noble contemplations, to furnish a refined\r\npleasure, and to lead our feeble reason from the works of nature up to\r\nits great Author and Sustainer. Considering this as the ultimate end of\r\nscience, no branch of it can surely claim precedence of Astronomy. No\r\nother science furnishes such a palpable embodiment of the abstractions\r\nwhich lie at the foundation of our intellectual system; the great ideas\r\nof time, and space, and extension, and magnitude, and number, and\r\nmotion, and power. How grand the conception of the ages on ages required\r\nfor several of the secular equations of the solar system; of distances\r\nfrom which the light of a fixed star would not reach us in twenty\r\nmillions of years, of magnitudes compared with which the earth is but a\r\nfoot-ball; of starry hosts--suns like our own--numberless as the sands\r\non the shore; of worlds and systems shooting through the infinite\r\nspaces, with a velocity compared with which the cannon-ball is a\r\nway-worn, heavy-paced traveler![A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Nichol's _Architecture of the Heavens_, p. 160.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE SPECTACLE OF THE HEAVENS.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, as we are indebted to our observatories for elevating our\r\nconceptions of the heavenly bodies, they present, even to the unaided\r\nsight, scenes of glory which words are too feeble to describe. I had\r\noccasion, a few weeks since, to take the early train from Providence to\r\nBoston; and for this purpose rose at 2 o'clock in the morning. Every\r\nthing around was wrapped in darkness and hushed in silence, broken only\r\nby what seemed at that hour the unearthly clank and rush of the train.\r\nIt was a mild, serene midsummer's night; the sky was without a\r\ncloud--the winds were whist. The moon, then in the last quarter, had\r\njust risen, and the stars shone with a spectral luster but little\r\naffected by her presence; Jupiter, two hours high, was the herald of the\r\nday; the Pleiades, just above the horizon, shed their sweet influence in\r\nthe east; Lyra sparkled near the zenith; Andromeda veiled her newly\r\ndiscovered glories from the naked eye in the south; the steady Pointers,\r\nfar beneath the pole, looked meekly up from the depths of the north to\r\ntheir sovereign.\r\n\r\nSuch was the glorious spectacle as I entered the train. As we proceeded,\r\nthe timid approach of twilight became more perceptible; the intense blue\r\nof the sky began to soften, the smaller stars, like little children,\r\nwent first to rest; the sister-beams of the Pleiades soon melted\r\ntogether; but the bright constellations of the west and north remained\r\nunchanged. Steadily the wondrous transfiguration went on. Hands of\r\nangels hidden from mortal eyes shifted the scenery of the heavens; the\r\nglories of night dissolved into the glories of the dawn. The blue sky\r\nnow turned more softly gray; the great watch-stars shut up their holy\r\neyes; the east began to kindle. Faint streaks of purple soon blushed\r\nalong the sky; the whole celestial concave was filled with the inflowing\r\ntides of the morning light, which came pouring down from above in one\r\ngreat ocean of radiance; till at length, as we reached the Blue Hills, a\r\nflash of purple fire blazed out from above the horizon, and turned the\r\ndewy teardrops of flower and leaf into rubies and diamonds. In a few\r\nseconds the everlasting gates of the morning were thrown wide open, and\r\nthe lord of day, arrayed in glories too severe for the gaze of man,\r\nbegan his course.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder at the superstition of the ancient Magians, who in the\r\nmorning of the world went up to the hill-tops of Central Asia, and\r\nignorant of the true God, adored the most glorious work of his hand.\r\nBut I am filled with amazement, when I am told that in this enlightened\r\nage, and in the heart of the Christian world, there are persons who can\r\nwitness this daily manifestation of the power and wisdom of the Creator,\r\nand yet say in their hearts, \"There is no God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                          UNDISCOVERED BODIES.\r\n\r\nNumerous as are the heavenly bodies visible to the naked eye, and\r\nglorious as are their manifestations, it is probable that in our own\r\nsystem there are great numbers as yet undiscovered. Just two hundred\r\nyears ago this year, Huyghens announced the discovery of one satellite\r\nof Saturn, and expressed the opinion that the six planets and six\r\nsatellites then known, and making up the perfect number of _twelve_,\r\ncomposed the whole of our planetary system. In 1729 an astronomical\r\nwriter expressed the opinion that there might be other bodies in our\r\nsystem, but that the limit of telescopic power had been reached, and no\r\nfurther discoveries were likely to be made.[A] The orbit of one comet\r\nonly had been definitively calculated. Since that time the power of the\r\ntelescope has been indefinitely increased; two primary planets of the\r\nfirst class, ten satellites, and forty-three small planets revolving\r\nbetween Mars and Jupiter, have been discovered, the orbits of six or\r\nseven hundred comets, some of brief period, have been ascertained;--and\r\nit has been computed, that hundreds of thousands of these mysterious\r\nbodies wander through our system. There is no reason to think that all\r\nthe primary planets, which revolve about the sun, have been discovered.\r\nAn indefinite increase in the number of asteroids may be anticipated;\r\nwhile outside of Neptune, between our sun and the nearest fixed star,\r\nsupposing the attraction of the sun to prevail through half the\r\ndistance, there is room for ten more primary planets succeeding each\r\nother at distances increasing in a geometrical ratio. The first of\r\nthese will, unquestionably, be discovered as soon as the perturbations\r\nof Neptune shall have been accurately observed; and with maps of the\r\nheavens, on which the smallest telescopic stars are laid down, it may be\r\ndiscovered much sooner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Memoirs of A.A.S._, vol. iii, 275.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE VASTNESS OF CREATION.\r\n\r\nBut it is when we turn our observation and our thoughts from our own\r\nsystem, to the systems which lie beyond it in the heavenly spaces, that\r\nwe approach a more adequate conception of the vastness of creation. All\r\nanalogy teaches us that the sun which gives light to us is but one of\r\nthose countless stellar fires which deck the firmament, and that every\r\nglittering star in that shining host is the center of a system as vast\r\nand as full of subordinate luminaries as our own. Of these suns--centers\r\nof planetary systems--thousands are visible to the naked eye, millions\r\nare discovered by the telescope. Sir John Herschell, in the account of\r\nhis operations at the Cape of Good Hope (p. 381) calculates that about\r\nfive and a half millions of stars are visible enough to be _distinctly\r\ncounted_ in a twenty-foot reflector, in both hemispheres. He adds, that\r\n\"the actual number is much greater, there can be little doubt.\" His\r\nillustrious father, estimated on one occasion that 125,000 stars passed\r\nthrough the field of his forty foot reflector in a quarter of an hour.\r\nThis would give 12,000,000 for the entire circuit of the heavens, in a\r\nsingle telescopic zone; and this estimate was made under the assumption\r\nthat the nebulæ were masses of luminous matter not yet condensed into\r\nsuns.\r\n\r\nThese stupendous calculations, however, form but the first column of the\r\ninventory of the universe. Faint white specks are visible, even to the\r\nnaked eye of a practiced observer in different parts of the heavens.\r\nUnder high magnifying powers, several thousands of such spots are\r\nvisible,--no longer however, faint, white specks, but many of them\r\nresolved by powerful telescopes into vast aggregations of stars, each\r\nof which may, with propriety, be compared with the milky way. Many of\r\nthese nebulæ, however, resisted the power of Sir Wm. Herschell's great\r\nreflector, and were, accordingly, still regarded by him as masses of\r\nunformed matter, not yet condensed into suns. This, till a few years\r\nsince, was, perhaps, the prevailing opinion; and the nebular theory\r\nfilled a large space in modern astronomical science. But with the\r\nincrease of instrumental power, especially under the mighty grasp of\r\nLord Rosse's gigantic reflector, and the great refractors at Pulkova and\r\nCambridge, the most irresolvable of these nebulæ have given way; and the\r\nbetter opinion now is, that every one of them is a galaxy, like our own\r\nmilky way, composed of millions of suns. In other words, we are brought\r\nto the bewildering conclusion that thousands of these misty specks, the\r\ngreater part of them too faint to be seen with the naked eye, are, not\r\neach a universe like our solar system, but each a \"swarm\" of universes\r\nof unappreciable magnitude.[A] The mind sinks, overpowered by the\r\ncontemplation. We repeat the words, but they no longer convey distinct\r\nideas to the understanding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Humboldt's _Cosmos_, iii. 41.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CONCEPTIONS OF THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\nBut these conclusions, however vast their comprehension, carry us but\r\nanother step forward in the realms of sidereal astronomy. A proper\r\nmotion in space of our sun, and of the fixed stars as we call them,\r\nhas long been believed to exist. Their vast distances only prevent its\r\nbeing more apparent. The great improvement of instruments of measurement\r\nwithin the last generation has not only established the existence of\r\nthis motion, but has pointed to the region in the starry vault around\r\nwhich our whole solar and stellar system, with its myriad of attendant\r\nplanetary worlds, appears to be performing a mighty revolution. If,\r\nthen, we assume that outside of the system to which we belong and in\r\nwhich our sun is but a star like Aldebaran or Sirius, the different\r\nnebulæ of which we have spoken,--thousands of which spot the\r\nheavens--constitute a distinct family of universes, we must, following\r\nthe guide of analogy, attribute to each of them also, beyond all the\r\nrevolutions of their individual attendant planetary systems, a great\r\nrevolution, comprehending the whole; while the same course of analogical\r\nreasoning would lead us still further onward, and in the last analysis,\r\nrequire us to assume a transcendental connection between all these\r\nmighty systems--a universe of universes, circling round in the infinity\r\nof space, and preserving its equilibrium by the same laws of mutual\r\nattraction which bind the lower worlds together.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that conceptions like these are calculated rather to\r\ndepress than to elevate us in the scale of being; that, banished as he\r\nis by these contemplations to a corner of creation, and there reduced\r\nto an atom, man sinks to nothingness in this infinity of worlds. But a\r\nsecond thought corrects the impression. These vast contemplations are\r\nwell calculated to inspire awe, but not abasement. Mind and matter are\r\nincommensurable. An immortal soul, even while clothed in \"this muddy\r\nvesture of decay,\" is in the eye of God and reason, a purer essence than\r\nthe brightest sun that lights the depths of heaven. The organized human\r\neye, instinct with life and soul, which, gazing through the telescope,\r\ntravels up to the cloudy speck in the handle of Orion's sword, and bids\r\nit blaze forth into a galaxy as vast as ours, stands higher in the order\r\nof being than all that host of luminaries. The intellect of Newton which\r\ndiscovered the law that holds the revolving worlds together, is a nobler\r\nwork of God than a universe of universes of unthinking matter.\r\n\r\nIf, still treading the loftiest paths of analogy, we adopt the\r\nsupposition,--to me I own the grateful supposition,--that the countless\r\nplanetary worlds which attend these countless suns, are the abodes of\r\nrational beings like man, instead of bringing back from this exalted\r\nconception a feeling of insignificance, as if the individuals of our\r\nrace were but poor atoms in the infinity of being, I regard it, on the\r\ncontrary, as a glory of our human nature, that it belongs to a family\r\nwhich no man can number of rational natures like itself. In the order of\r\nbeing they may stand beneath us, or they may stand above us; _he_ may\r\nwell be content with his place, who is made \"a little lower than the\r\nangels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CONTEMPLATION OF THE HEAVENS.\r\n\r\nFinally, my Friends, I believe there is no contemplation better adapted\r\nto awaken devout ideas than that of the heavenly bodies,--no branch of\r\nnatural science which bears clearer testimony to the power and wisdom of\r\nGod than that to which you this day consecrate a temple. The heart of\r\nthe ancient world, with all the prevailing ignorance of the true nature\r\nand motions of the heavenly orbs, was religiously impressed by their\r\nsurvey. There is a passage in one of those admirable philosophical\r\ntreatises of Cicero composed in the decline of life, as a solace under\r\ndomestic bereavement and patriotic concern at the impending convulsions\r\nof the state, in which, quoting from some lost work of Aristotle, he\r\ntreats the topic in a manner which almost puts to shame the teachings of\r\nChristian wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"Præclare ergo Aristoteles, 'Si essent,' inquit, 'qui sub terra semper\r\nhabitavissent, bonis et illustribus domiciliis quæ essent ornata signis\r\natque picturis, instructaque rebus iis omnibus quibus abundant ii qui\r\nbeati putantur, nec tamen exissent unquam supra terram; accepissent\r\nautem fama et auditione, esse quoddam numen et vim Deorum,--deinde\r\naliquo tempore patefactis terræ faucibus ex illis abditis sedibus\r\nevadere in hæc loca quæ nos incolimus, atque exire potuissent; cum\r\nrepente terram et maria coelumque, vidissent; nubium magnitudinem\r\nventorumque vim, cognovissent; aspexissentque solem, ejusque tum\r\nmagnitudinem, pulchritudinemque; tum etiam efficientiam cognovissent,\r\nquod is diem efficeret, toto coelo luce diffusa; cum autem terras nox\r\nopacasset, tum coelum totum cernerent astris distinctum et ornatum,\r\nlunæque luminum varietatem tum crescentis tum senescentis, corumque\r\nomnium ortus et occasus atque in æternitate ratos immutabilesque\r\ncursus;--hæc cum viderent, profecto et esse Deos, et hæc tanta opera\r\nDeorum esse, arbitrarentur.\"[A]\r\n\r\nThere is much by day to engage the attention of the Observatory; the\r\nsun, his apparent motions, his dimensions, the spots on his disc (to\r\nus the faint indications of movements of unimagined grandeur in his\r\nluminous atmosphere), a solar eclipse, a transit of the inferior\r\nplanets, the mysteries of the spectrum;--all phenomena of vast\r\nimportance and interest. But night is the astronomer's accepted time; he\r\ngoes to his delightful labors when the busy world goes to its rest. A\r\ndark pall spreads over the resorts of active life; terrestrial objects,\r\nhill and valley, and rock and stream, and the abodes of men disappear;\r\nbut the curtain is drawn up which concealed the heavenly hosts. There\r\nthey shine and there they move, as they moved and shone to the eyes of\r\nNewton and Galileo, of Kepler and Copernicus, of Ptolemy and Hipparchus;\r\nyes, as they moved and shone when the morning stars sang together, and\r\nall the sons of God shouted for joy. All has changed on earth; but\r\nthe glorious heavens remain unchanged. The plow passes over the site\r\nof mighty cities,--the homes of powerful nations are desolate, the\r\nlanguages they spoke are forgotten; but the stars that shone for them\r\nare shining for us; the same eclipses run their steady cycle; the same\r\nequinoxes call out the flowers of spring, and send the husbandman\r\nto the harvest; the sun pauses at either tropic as he did when his\r\ncourse began; and sun and moon, and planet and satellite, and star and\r\nconstellation and galaxy, still bear witness to the power, the wisdom,\r\nand the love, which placed them in the heavens and uphold them there.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: \"Nobly does Aristotle observe, that if there were beings\r\nwho had always lived under ground, in convenient, nay, in magnificent\r\ndwellings, adorned with statues and pictures, and every thing which\r\nbelongs to prosperous life, but who had never come above ground; who had\r\nheard, however, by fame and report, of the being and power of the gods;\r\nif, at a certain time, the portals of the earth being thrown open,\r\nthey had been able to emerge from those hidden abodes to the regions\r\ninhabited by us; when suddenly they had seen the earth, the sea, and\r\nthe sky; had perceived the vastness of the clouds and the force of the\r\nwinds; had contemplated the sun, his magnitude and his beauty, and\r\nstill more his effectual power, that it is he who makes the day, by\r\nthe diffusion of his light through the whole sky; and, when night had\r\ndarkened the earth, should then behold the whole heavens studded and\r\nadorned with stars, and the various lights of the waxing and waning\r\nmoon, the risings and the settings of all these heavenly bodies, and the\r\ncourses fixed and immutable in all eternity; when, I say, they should\r\nsee these things, truly they would believe that there were gods, and\r\nthese so great things are their works.\"--Cicero, _De Natura Deorum_ lib.\r\nii., § 30.]",
