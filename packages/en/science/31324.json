It flies! I am master of the Powers of the Air at last!\"\r\n\r\nThey were strange words to be uttered, as they were, by a pale,\r\nhaggard, half-starved looking young fellow in a dingy, comfortless\r\nroom on the top floor of a South London tenement-house; and yet there\r\nwas a triumphant ring in his voice, and a clear, bright flush on his\r\nthin cheeks that spoke at least for his own absolute belief in their\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nLet us see how far he was justified in that belief.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTo begin at the beginning, Richard Arnold was one of those men whom\r\nthe world is wont to call dreamers and enthusiasts before they\r\nsucceed, and heaven-born geniuses and benefactors of humanity\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nHe was twenty-six, and for nearly six years past he had devoted\r\nhimself, soul and body, to a single idea--to the so far unsolved\r\nproblem of aërial navigation.\r\n\r\nThis idea had haunted him ever since he had been able to think\r\nlogically at all--first dimly at school, and then more clearly at\r\ncollege, where he had carried everything before him in mathematics\r\nand natural science, until it had at last become a ruling passion\r\nthat crowded everything else out of his life, and made him,\r\ncommercially speaking, that most useless of social units--a\r\none-idea'd man, whose idea could not be put into working form.\r\n\r\nHe was an orphan, with hardly a blood relation in the world. He had\r\nstarted with plenty of friends, mostly made at college, who thought\r\nhe had a brilliant future before him, and therefore looked upon him\r\nas a man whom it might be useful to know.\r\n\r\nBut as time went on, and no results came, these dropped off, and he\r\ngot to be looked upon as an amiable lunatic, who was wasting his\r\ngreat talents and what money he had on impracticable fancies, when he\r\nmight have been earning a handsome income if he had stuck to the\r\nbeaten track, and gone in for practical work.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions that he had won at college, and the reputation he\r\nhad gained as a wonderfully clever chemist and mechanician, had led\r\nto several offers of excellent positions in great engineering firms;\r\nbut to the surprise and disgust of his friends he had declined them\r\nall. No one knew why, for he had kept his secret with the almost\r\npassionate jealousy of the true enthusiast, and so his refusals were\r\nput down to sheer foolishness, and he became numbered with the\r\ngeniuses who are failures because they are not practical.\r\n\r\nWhen he came of age he had inherited a couple of thousand pounds,\r\nwhich had been left in trust to him by his father. Had it not been\r\nfor that two thousand pounds he would have been forced to employ his\r\nknowledge and his talents conventionally, and would probably have\r\nmade a fortune. But it was just enough to relieve him from the\r\nnecessity of earning his living for the time being, and to make it\r\npossible for him to devote himself entirely to the realisation of his\r\nlife-dream--at any rate until the money was gone.\r\n\r\nOf course he yielded to the temptation--nay, he never gave the other\r\ncourse a moment's thought. Two thousand pounds would last him for\r\nyears; and no one could have persuaded him that with complete\r\nleisure, freedom from all other concerns, and money for the necessary\r\nexperiments, he would not have succeeded long before his capital was\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nSo he put the money into a bank whence he could draw it out as he\r\nchose, and withdrew himself from the world to work out the ideal of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nYear after year passed, and still success did not come. He found\r\npractice very different from theory, and in a hundred details he met\r\nwith difficulties he had never seen on paper. Meanwhile his money\r\nmelted away in costly experiments which only raised hopes that ended\r\nin bitter disappointment. His wonderful machine was a miracle of\r\ningenuity, and was mechanically perfect in every detail save one--it\r\nwould do no practical work.\r\n\r\nLike every other inventor who had grappled with the problem, he had\r\nfound himself constantly faced with that fatal ratio of weight to\r\npower. No engine that he could devise would do more than lift itself\r\nand the machine. Again and again he had made a toy that would fly, as\r\nothers had done before him, but a machine that would navigate the air\r\nas a steamer or an electric vessel navigated the waters, carrying\r\ncargo and passengers, was still an impossibility while that terrible\r\nproblem of weight and power remained unsolved.\r\n\r\nIn order to eke out his money to the uttermost, he had clothed and\r\nlodged himself meanly, and had denied himself everything but the\r\nbarest necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThus he had prolonged the struggle for over five years of toil and\r\nprivation and hope deferred, and now, when his last sovereign had\r\nbeen changed and nearly spent, success--real, tangible, practical\r\nsuccess--had come to him, and the discovery that was to be to the\r\ntwentieth century what the steam-engine had been to the nineteenth\r\nwas accomplished.\r\n\r\nHe had discovered the true motive power at last.\r\n\r\nTwo liquefied gases--which, when united, exploded spontaneously--were\r\nadmitted by a clockwork escapement in minute quantities into the\r\ncylinders of his engine, and worked the pistons by the expansive\r\nforce of the gases generated by the explosion. There was no weight\r\nbut the engine itself and the cylinders containing the liquefied\r\ngases. Furnaces, boilers, condensers, accumulators, dynamos--all the\r\nponderous apparatus of steam and electricity--were done away with,\r\nand he had a power at command greater than either of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it. The moment that his trembling fingers\r\nset the escapement mechanism in motion, the model that embodied the\r\nthought and labour of years rose into the air as gracefully as a bird\r\non the wing, and sailed round and round in obedience to its rudder,\r\nstraining hard at the string which prevented it from striking the\r\nceiling. It was weighted in strict proportion to the load that the\r\nfull-sized air-ship would have to carry. To increase this was merely\r\na matter of increasing the power of the engine and the size of the\r\nfloats and fans.\r\n\r\nThe room was a large one, for the house had been built for a better\r\nfate than letting in tenements, and it ran from back to front with a\r\nwindow at each end. Out of doors there was a strong breeze blowing,\r\nand as soon as Arnold was sure that his ship was able to hold its own\r\nin still air, he threw both the windows open and let the wind blow\r\nstraight through the room. Then he drew the air-ship down,\r\nstraightened the rudder, and set it against the breeze.\r\n\r\nIn almost agonised suspense he watched it rise from the floor, float\r\nmotionless for a moment, and then slowly forge ahead in the teeth of\r\nthe wind, gathering speed as it went. It was then that he had uttered\r\nthat triumphant cry of \"Victory!\" All the long years of privation and\r\nhope deferred vanished in that one supreme moment of innocent and\r\nbloodless conquest, and he saw himself master of a kingdom as wide as\r\nthe world itself.\r\n\r\nHe let the model fly the length of the room before he stopped the\r\nclockwork and cut off the motive power, allowing it to sink gently to\r\nthe floor. Then came the reaction. He looked steadfastly at his\r\nhandiwork for several moments in silence, and then he turned and\r\nthrew himself on to a shabby little bed that stood in one corner of\r\nthe room and burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nTriumph had come, but had it not come too late? He knew the boundless\r\npossibilities of his invention--but they had still to be realised. To\r\ndo this would cost thousands of pounds, and he had just one\r\nhalf-crown and a few coppers. Even these were not really his own, for\r\nhe was already a week behind with his rent, and another payment fell\r\ndue the next day. That would be twelve shillings in all, and if it\r\nwas not paid he would be turned into the street.\r\n\r\nAs he raised himself from the bed he looked despairingly round the\r\nbare, shabby room. No; there was nothing there that he could pawn or\r\nsell. Everything saleable had gone already to keep up the struggle of\r\nhope against despair. The bed and wash-stand, the plain deal table,\r\nand the one chair that comprised the furniture of the room were not\r\nhis. A little carpenter's bench, a few worn tools and odds and ends\r\nof scientific apparatus, and a dozen well-used books--these were all\r\nthat he possessed in the world now, save the clothes on his back, and\r\na plain painted sea-chest in which he was wont to lock up his\r\nprecious model when he had to go out.\r\n\r\nHis model! No, he could not sell that. At best it would fetch but the\r\nprice of an ingenious toy, and without the secret of the two gases it\r\nwas useless. But was not that worth something? Yes, if he did not\r\nstarve to death before he could persuade any one that there was money\r\nin it. Besides, the chest and its priceless contents would be seized\r\nfor the rent next day, and then--\r\n\r\n\"God help me! What _am_ I to do?\"\r\n\r\nThe words broke from him like a cry of physical pain, and ended in a\r\nsob, and for all answer there was the silence of the room and the\r\ninarticulate murmur of the streets below coming up through the open\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nHe was weak with hunger and sick with excitement, for he had lived\r\nfor days on bread and cheese, and that day he had eaten nothing since\r\nthe crust that had served him for breakfast. His nerves, too, were\r\nshattered by the intense strain of his final trial and triumph, and\r\nhis head was getting light.\r\n\r\nWith a desperate effort he recovered himself, and the heroic\r\nresolution that had sustained him through his long struggle came to\r\nhis aid again. He got up and poured some water from the ewer into a\r\ncracked cup and drank it. It refreshed him for the moment, and he\r\npoured the rest of the water over his head. That steadied his nerves\r\nand cleared his brain. He took up the model from the floor, laid it\r\ntenderly and lovingly in its usual resting-place in the chest. Then\r\nhe locked the chest and sat down upon it to think the situation over.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later he rose to his feet and said aloud--\r\n\r\n\"It's no use. I can't think on an empty stomach. I'll go out and have\r\none more good meal if it's the last I ever have in the world, and\r\nthen perhaps some ideas will come.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took down his hat, buttoned his shabby velveteen coat\r\nto conceal his lack of a waistcoat, and went out, locking the door\r\nbehind him as he went.\r\n\r\nFive minutes' walk brought him to the Blackfriars Road, and then he\r\nturned towards the river and crossed the bridge just as the motley\r\nstream of city workers was crossing it in the opposite direction on\r\ntheir homeward journey.\r\n\r\nAt Ludgate Circus he went into an eating-house and fared sumptuously\r\non a plate of beef, some bread and butter, and a pint mug of coffee.\r\nAs he was eating a paper-boy came in and laid an _Echo_ on the table\r\nat which he was sitting. He took it up mechanically, and ran his eye\r\ncarelessly over the columns. He was in no humour to be interested by\r\nthe tattle of an evening paper, but in a paragraph under the heading\r\nof Foreign News a once familiar name caught his eye, and he read the\r\nparagraph through. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n      RAILWAY OUTRAGE IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n    When the Berlin-Petersburg express stopped last night at Kovno,\r\n    the first stop after passing the Russian frontier, a shocking\r\n    discovery was made in the smoking compartment of the palace car\r\n    which has been on the train for the last few months. Colonel\r\n    Dornovitch, of the Imperial Police, who is understood to have\r\n    been on his return journey from a secret mission to Paris, was\r\n    found stabbed to the heart and quite dead. In the centre of the\r\n    forehead were two short straight cuts in the form of a *T*\r\n    reaching to the bone. Not long ago Colonel Dornovitch was\r\n    instrumental in unearthing a formidable Nihilist conspiracy, in\r\n    connection with which over fifty men and women of various social\r\n    ranks were exiled for life to Siberia. The whole affair is\r\n    wrapped in the deepest mystery, the only clue in the hands of the\r\n    police being the fact that the cross cut on the forehead of the\r\n    victim indicates that the crime is the work, not of the Nihilists\r\n    proper, but of that unknown and mysterious society usually\r\n    alluded to as the Terrorists, not one of whom has ever been seen\r\n    save in his crimes. How the assassin managed to enter and leave\r\n    the car unperceived while the train was going at full speed is an\r\n    apparently insoluble riddle. Saving the victim and the\r\n    attendants, the only passengers in the car who had not retired to\r\n    rest were another officer in the Russian service and Lord\r\n    Alanmere, who was travelling to St. Petersburg to resume, after\r\n    leave of absence, the duties of the Secretaryship to the British\r\n    Embassy, to which he was appointed some two years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that must be the Lord Alanmere who was at Trinity in my time,\r\nor rather Viscount Tremayne, as he was then,\" mused Arnold, as he\r\nlaid the paper down. \"We were very good friends in those days. I\r\nwonder if he'd know me now, and lend me a ten-pound note to get me\r\nout of the infernal fix I'm in? I believe he would, for he was one of\r\nthe few really good-hearted men I have so far met with.\r\n\r\n\"If he were in London I really think I should take courage from my\r\ndesperation, and put my case before him and ask his help. However,\r\nhe's not in London, and so it's no use wishing. Well, I feel more of\r\na man for that shillingsworth of food and drink, and I'll go and wind\r\nup my dissipation with a pipe and a quiet think on the Embankment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAT WAR WITH SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Richard Arnold reached the Embankment dusk had deepened into\r\nnight, so far, at least, as nature was concerned. But in London in\r\nthe beginning of the twentieth century there was but little night to\r\nspeak of, save in the sense of a division of time. The date of the\r\npaper which contained the account of the tragedy on the Russian\r\nrailway was September 3rd, 1903, and within the last ten years\r\nenormous progress had been made in electric lighting.\r\n\r\nThe ebb and flow in the Thames had at last been turned to account,\r\nand worked huge turbines which perpetually stored up electric power\r\nthat was used not only for lighting, but for cooking in hotels and\r\nprivate houses, and for driving machinery. At all the great centres\r\nof traffic huge electric suns cast their rays far and wide along the\r\nstreets, supplementing the light of the lesser lamps with which they\r\nwere lined on each side.\r\n\r\nThe Embankment from Westminster to Blackfriars was bathed in a flood\r\nof soft white light from hundreds of great lamps running along both\r\nsides, and from the centre of each bridge a million candle-power sun\r\ncast rays upon the water that were continued in one unbroken stream\r\nof light from Chelsea to the Tower.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the river the scene was one of brilliant and\r\nsplendid opulence, that contrasted strongly with the half-lighted\r\ngloom of the murky wilderness of South London, dark and forbidding in\r\nits irredeemable ugliness.\r\n\r\nFrom Blackfriars Arnold walked briskly towards Westminster, bitterly\r\ncontrasting as he went the lavish display of wealth around him with\r\nthe sordid and seemingly hopeless poverty of his own desperate\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nHe was the maker and possessor of a far greater marvel than anything\r\nthat helped to make up this splendid scene, and yet the ragged tramps\r\nwho were remorselessly moved on from one seat to another by the\r\npolicemen as soon as they had settled themselves down for a rest and\r\na doze, were hardly poorer than he was.\r\n\r\nFor nearly four hours he paced backwards and forwards, every now and\r\nthen stopping to lean on the parapet, and once or twice to sit down,\r\nuntil the chill autumn wind pierced his scanty clothing, and\r\ncompelled him to resume his walk in order to get warm again.\r\n\r\nAll the time he turned his miserable situation over and over again in\r\nhis mind without avail. There seemed no way out of it; no way of\r\nobtaining the few pounds that would save him from homeless beggary\r\nand his splendid invention from being lost to him and the world,\r\ncertainly for years, and perhaps for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as hour after hour went by, and still no cheering thought\r\ncame, the misery of the present pressed closer and closer upon him.\r\nHe dare not go home, for that would be to bring the inevitable\r\ndisaster of the morrow nearer, and, besides, it was home no longer\r\ntill the rent was paid. He had two shillings, and he owed at least\r\ntwelve. He was also the maker of a machine for which the Tsar of\r\nRussia had made a standing offer of a million sterling. That million\r\nmight have been his if he had possessed the money necessary to bring\r\nhis invention under the notice of the great Autocrat.\r\n\r\nThat was the position he had turned over and over in his mind until\r\nits horrible contradictions maddened him. With a little money, riches\r\nand fame were his; without it he was a beggar in sight of starvation.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he doubted whether, even in his present dire extremity, he\r\ncould, had he had the chance, sell what might be made the most\r\nterrific engine of destruction ever thought of to the head and front\r\nof a despotism that he looked upon as the worst earthly enemy of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nFor the twentieth time he had paused in his weary walk to and fro to\r\nlean on the parapet close by Cleopatra's Needle. The Embankment was\r\nalmost deserted now, save by the tramps and a few isolated wanderers\r\nlike himself. For several minutes he looked out over the brightly\r\nglittering waters below him, wondering listlessly how long it would\r\ntake him to drown if he dropped over, and whether he would be rescued\r\nbefore he was dead, and brought back to life, and prosecuted the next\r\nday for daring to try and leave the world save in the conventional\r\nand orthodox fashion.\r\n\r\nThen his mind wandered back to the Tsar and his million, and he\r\npictured to himself the awful part that a fleet of air-ships such as\r\nhis would play in the general European war that people said could not\r\nnow be put off for many months longer. As he thought of this the\r\nvision grew in distinctness, and he saw them hovering over armies and\r\ncities and fortresses, and raining irresistible death and destruction\r\ndown upon them. The prospect appalled him, and he shuddered as he\r\nthought that it was now really within the possibility of realisation;\r\nand then his ideas began to translate themselves involuntarily into\r\nwords which he spoke aloud, completely oblivious for the time being\r\nof his surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think I would rather destroy it, and then take my secret with\r\nme out of the world, than put such an awful power of destruction and\r\nslaughter into the hands of the Tsar, or, for the matter of that, any\r\nother of the rulers of the earth. Their subjects can butcher each\r\nother quite efficiently enough as it is. The next war will be the\r\nmost frightful carnival of destruction that the world has ever seen;\r\nbut what would it be like if I were to give one of the nations of\r\nEurope the power of raining death and desolation on its enemies from\r\nthe skies! No, no! Such a power, if used at all, should only be used\r\nagainst and not for the despotisms that afflict the earth with the\r\ncurse of war!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not use it so, my friend, if you possess it, and would see\r\nmankind freed from its tyrants?\" said a quiet voice at his elbow.\r\n\r\nThe sound instantly scattered his vision to the winds, and he turned\r\nround with a startled exclamation to see who had spoken. As he did\r\nso, a whiff of smoke from a very good cigar drifted past his\r\nnostrils, and the voice said again in the same quiet, even tones--\r\n\r\n\"You must forgive me for my bad manners in listening to what you were\r\nsaying, and also for breaking in upon your reverie. My excuse must be\r\nthe great interest that your words had for me. Your opinions would\r\nappear to be exactly my own, too, and perhaps you will accept that as\r\nanother excuse for my rudeness.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first really kindly, friendly voice that Richard Arnold\r\nhad heard for many a long day, and the words were so well chosen and\r\nso politely uttered that it was impossible to feel any resentment, so\r\nhe simply said in answer--\r\n\r\n\"There was no rudeness, sir; and, besides, why should a gentleman\r\nlike you apologise for speaking to a\"--\r\n\r\n\"Another gentleman,\" quickly interrupted his new acquaintance.\r\n\"Because I transgressed the laws of politeness in doing so, and an\r\napology was due. Your speech tells me that we are socially equals.\r\nIntellectually you look my superior. The rest is a difference only of\r\nmoney, and that any smart swindler can bury himself in nowadays if he\r\nchooses. But come, if you have no objection to make my better\r\nacquaintance, I have a great desire to make yours. If you will pardon\r\nmy saying so, you are evidently not an ordinary man, or else,\r\nsomething tells me, you would be rich. Have a smoke and let us talk,\r\nsince we apparently have a subject in common. Which way are you\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere--and therefore anywhere,\" replied Arnold, with a laugh that\r\nhad but little merriment in it. \"I have reached a point from which\r\nall roads are one to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That being the case I propose that you shall take the one that leads\r\nto my chambers in Savoy Mansions yonder. We shall find a bit of\r\nsupper ready, I expect, and then I shall ask you to talk. Come\r\nalong!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no more mistaking the genuine kindness and sincerity of the\r\ninvitation than the delicacy with which it was given. To have refused\r\nwould not only have been churlish, but it would have been for a\r\ndrowning man to knock aside a kindly hand held out to help him; so\r\nArnold accepted, and the two new strangely met and strangely assorted\r\nfriends walked away together in the direction of the Savoy.\r\n\r\nThe suite of rooms occupied by Arnold's new acquaintance was the beau\r\nideal of a wealthy bachelor's abode. Small, compact, cosy, and richly\r\nfurnished, yet in the best of taste withal, the rooms looked like an\r\nindoor paradise to him after the bare squalor of the one room that\r\nhad been his own home for over two years.\r\n\r\nHis host took him first into a dainty little bath-room to wash his\r\nhands, and by the time he had performed his scanty toilet supper was\r\nalready on the table in the sitting-room. Nothing melts reserve like\r\na good well-cooked meal washed down by appropriate liquids, and\r\nbefore supper was half over Arnold and his host were chatting\r\ntogether as easily as though they stood on perfectly equal terms and\r\nhad known each other for years. His new friend seemed purposely to\r\nkeep the conversation to general subjects until the meal was over and\r\nhis pattern man-servant had removed the cloth and left them together\r\nwith the wine and cigars on the table.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had closed the door behind him his host motioned Arnold\r\nto an easy-chair on one side of the fireplace, threw himself into\r\nanother on the other side, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Now, my friend, plant yourself, as they say across the water, help\r\nyourself to what there is as the spirit moves you, and talk--the more\r\nabout yourself the better. But stop. I forgot that we do not even\r\nknow each other's name yet. Let me introduce myself first.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Maurice Colston; I am a bachelor, as you see. For the\r\nrest, in practice I am an idler, a dilettante, and a good deal else\r\nthat is pleasant and utterly useless. In theory, let me tell you, I\r\nam a Socialist, or something of the sort, with a lively conviction as\r\nto the injustice and absurdity of the social and economic conditions\r\nwhich enable me to have such a good time on earth without having done\r\nanything to deserve it beyond having managed to be born the son of my\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked at his guest through the wreaths of his cigar\r\nsmoke as much as to say: \"And now who are you?\"\r\n\r\nArnold took the silent hint, and opened his mouth and his heart at\r\nthe same time. Quite apart from the good turn he had done him, there\r\nwas a genial frankness about his unconventional host that chimed in\r\nso well with his own nature that he cast all reserve aside, and told\r\nplainly and simply the story of his life and its master passion, his\r\ndreams and hopes and failures, and his final triumph in the hour when\r\ntriumph itself was defeat.\r\n\r\nHis host heard him through without a word, but towards the end of his\r\nstory his face betrayed an interest, or rather an expectant anxiety,\r\nto hear what was coming next that no mere friendly concern of the\r\nmoment for one less fortunate than himself could adequately account\r\nfor. At length, when Arnold had completed his story with a brief but\r\ngraphic description of the last successful trial of his model, he\r\nleant forward in his chair, and, fixing his dark, steady eyes on his\r\nguest's face, said in a voice from which every trace of his former\r\ngood-humoured levity had vanished--\r\n\r\n\"A strange story, and truer, I think, than the one I told you. Now\r\ntell me on your honour as a gentleman: Were you really in earnest\r\nwhen I heard you say on the embankment that you would rather smash up\r\nyour model and take the secret with you into the next world, than\r\nsell your discovery to the Tsar for the million that he has offered\r\nfor such an air-ship as yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely in earnest,\" was the reply. \"I have seen enough of the\r\nseamy side of this much-boasted civilisation of ours to know that it\r\nis the most awful mockery that man ever insulted his Maker with. It\r\nis based on fraud, and sustained by force--force that ruthlessly\r\ncrushes all who do not bow the knee to Mammon. I am the enemy of a\r\nsociety that does not permit a man to be honest and live, unless he\r\nhas money and can defy it. I have just two shillings in the world,\r\nand I would rather throw them into the Thames and myself after them\r\nthan take that million from the Tsar in exchange for an engine of\r\ndestruction that would make him master of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are brave words,\" said Colston, with a smile. \"Forgive me for\r\nsaying so, but I wonder whether you would repeat them if I told you\r\nthat I am a servant of his Majesty the Tsar, and that you shall have\r\nthat million for your model and your secret the moment that you\r\nconvince me that what you have told me is true.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished speaking Arnold had risen to his feet. He\r\nheard him out, and then he said, slowly and steadily--\r\n\r\n\"I should not take the trouble to repeat them; I should only tell you\r\nthat I am sorry that I have eaten salt with a man who could take\r\nadvantage of my poverty to insult me. Good night.\"\r\n\r\nHe was moving towards the door when Colston jumped up from his chair,\r\nstrode round the table, and got in front of him. Then he put his two\r\nhands on his shoulders, and, looking straight into his eyes, said in\r\na tone that vibrated with emotion--\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, I have found an honest man at last! Go and sit down\r\nagain, my friend, my comrade, as I hope you soon will be. Forgive me\r\nfor the foolishness that I spoke! I am no servant of the Tsar. He and\r\nall like him have no more devoted enemy on earth than I am. Look! I\r\nwill soon prove it to you.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said the last words, Colston let go Arnold's shoulders, flung\r\noff his coat and waistcoat, slipped his braces off his shoulders, and\r\npulled his shirt up to his neck. Then he turned his bare back to his\r\nguest, and said--\r\n\r\n\"That is the sign-manual of Russian tyranny--the mark of the knout!\"\r\n\r\nArnold shrank back with a cry of horror at the sight. From waist to\r\nneck Colston's back was a mass of hideous scars and wheals, crossing\r\neach other and rising up into purple lumps, with livid blue and grey\r\nspaces between them. As he stood, there was not an inch of\r\nnaturally-coloured skin to be seen. It was like the back of a man who\r\nhad been flayed alive, and then flogged with a cat-o'-nine-tails.\r\n\r\nBefore Arnold had overcome his horror his host had re-adjusted his\r\nclothing. Then he turned to him and said--\r\n\r\n\"That was my reward for telling the governor of a petty Russian town\r\nthat he was a brute-beast for flogging a poor decrepit old Jewess to\r\ndeath. Do you believe me now when I say that I am no servant or\r\nfriend of the Tsar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" replied Arnold, holding out his hand, \"you were right to\r\ntry me, and I was wrong to be so hasty. It is a failing of mine that\r\nhas done me plenty of harm before now. I think I know now what you\r\nare without your telling me. Give me a piece of paper and you shall\r\nhave my address, so that you can come to-morrow and see the\r\nmodel--only I warn you that you will have to pay my rent to keep my\r\nlandlord's hands off it. And then I must be off, for I see it's past\r\ntwelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not going out again to-night, my friend, while I have a sofa\r\nand plenty of rugs at your disposal,\" said his host. \"You will sleep\r\nhere, and in the morning we will go together and see this marvel of\r\nyours. Meanwhile sit down and make yourself at home with another\r\ncigar. We have only just begun to know each other--we two enemies of\r\nSociety!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA FRIENDLY CHAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after eight the next morning Colston came into the sitting-room\r\nwhere Arnold had slept on the sofa, and dreamt dreams of war and\r\nworld-revolts and battles fought in mid-air between aërial navies\r\nbuilt on the plan of his own model. When Colston came in he was just\r\nawake enough to be wondering whether the events of the previous night\r\nwere a reality or part of his dreams--a doubt that was speedily set\r\nat rest by his host drawing back the curtains and pulling up the\r\nblinds.\r\n\r\nThe moment his eyes were properly open he saw that he was anywhere\r\nbut in his own shabby room in Southwark, and the rest was made clear\r\nby Colston saying--\r\n\r\n\"Well, comrade Arnold, Lord High Admiral of the Air, how have you\r\nslept? I hope you found the sofa big and soft enough, and that the\r\nlast cigar has left no evil effects behind it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? Oh, good morning! I don't know whether it was the whisky or the\r\ncigars, or what it was; but do you know I have been dreaming all\r\nsorts of absurd things about battles in the air and dropping\r\nexplosives on fortresses and turning them into small volcanoes. When\r\nyou came in just now I hadn't the remotest idea where I was. It's\r\ntime to get up, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's after eight a good bit. I've had my tub, so the bath-room\r\nis at your service. Meanwhile, Burrows will be laying the table for\r\nbreakfast. When you have finished your tub, come into my\r\ndressing-room, and let me rig you out. We are about of a size, and I\r\nthink I shall be able to meet your most fastidious taste. In fact, I\r\ncould rig you out as anything--from a tramp to an officer of the\r\nGuards.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't take much change to accomplish the former, I'm afraid.\r\nBut, really, I couldn't think of trespassing so far on your\r\nhospitality as to take your very clothes from you. I'm deep enough in\r\nyour debt already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense, Richard Arnold. The tone in which those last\r\nwords were said shows me that you have not duly laid to heart what I\r\nsaid last night. There is no such thing as private property in the\r\nBrotherhood, of which I hope, by this time to-morrow, you will be an\r\ninitiate.\r\n\r\n\"What I have here is mine only for the purposes of the Cause,\r\nwherefore it is as much yours as mine, for to-day we are going on the\r\nBrotherhood's business. Why, then, should you have any scruples about\r\nwearing the Brotherhood's clothes? Now clear out and get tubbed, and\r\nwash some of those absurd ideas out of your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as you put it that way, I don't mind, only remember that I\r\ndon't necessarily put on the principles of the Brotherhood with its\r\nclothes.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Arnold got up from the sofa, stretched himself, and went\r\noff to make his toilet.\r\n\r\nWhen he sat down to breakfast with his host half an hour later, very\r\nfew who had seen him on the Embankment the night before would have\r\nrecognised him as the same man. The tailor, after all, does a good\r\ndeal to make the man, externally at least, and the change of clothes\r\nin Arnold's case had transformed him from a superior looking tramp\r\ninto an aristocratic and decidedly good-looking man, in the prime of\r\nhis youth, saving only for the thinness and pallor of his face, and a\r\nperceptible stoop in the shoulders.\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast they chatted about their plans for the day, and then\r\ndrifted into generalities, chiefly of a political nature.\r\n\r\nThe better Arnold came to know Maurice Colston the more remarkable\r\nhis character appeared to him; and it was his growing wonder at the\r\ncontradictions that it exhibited that made him say towards the end of\r\nthe meal--\r\n\r\n\"I must say you're a queer sort of conspirator, Colston. My idea of\r\nNihilists and members of revolutionary societies has always taken the\r\nform of silent, stealthy, cautious beings, with a lively distrust and\r\nhatred of the whole human race outside their own circles. And yet\r\nhere are you, an active member of the most terrible secret society in\r\nexistence, pledged to the destruction of nearly every institution on\r\nearth, and carrying your life in your hand, opening your heart like a\r\nschoolboy to a man you have literally not known for twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you had made a mistake in me. What would there be to prevent\r\nme telling the police who you are, and having you locked up with a\r\nview to extradition to Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place,\" replied Colston quietly, \"you would not do so,\r\nbecause I am not mistaken in you, and because, in your heart, whether\r\nyou fully know it or not, you believe as I do about the destruction\r\nthat is about to fall upon Society.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, if you did betray my confidence, I should be\r\nable to bring such an overwhelming array of the most respectable\r\nevidence to show that I was nothing like what I really am, that you\r\nwould be laughed at for a madman; and, in the third place, there\r\nwould be an inquest on you within twenty-four hours after you had\r\ntold your story. Do you remember the death of Inspector Ainsworth, of\r\nthe Criminal Investigation Department, about six months ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course I do. Hermit and all as I was, I could hardly help\r\nhearing about that, considering what a noise it made. But I thought\r\nthat was cleared up. Didn't one of that gang of garotters that was\r\nbroken up in South London a couple of months later confess to\r\nstrangling him in the statement that he made before he was executed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and his widow is now getting ten shillings a week for life on\r\naccount of that confession. Birkett no more killed Ainsworth than you\r\ndid; but he had killed two or three others, and so the confession\r\ndidn't do him very much harm.\r\n\r\n\"No; Ainsworth met his death in quite another way. He accepted from\r\nthe Russian secret police bureau in London a bribe of £250 down and\r\nthe promise of another £250 if he succeeded in manufacturing enough\r\nevidence against a member of our Outer Circle to get him extradited\r\nto Russia on a trumped-up charge of murder.\r\n\r\n\"The Inner Circle learnt of this from one of our spies in the Russian\r\nLondon police, and----, well, Ainsworth was found dead with the mark\r\nof the Terror upon his forehead before he had time to put his\r\ntreachery into action. He was executed by two of the Brotherhood, who\r\nare members of the Metropolitan police force, and who were afterwards\r\ncomplimented by the magistrate for the intelligent efforts they had\r\nmade in bringing the murderers to justice.\"\r\n\r\nColston told the dark story in the most careless of tones between the\r\npuffs of his after-breakfast cigarette. Arnold stifled his horror as\r\nwell as he was able, but he could not help saying, when his host had\r\ndone--\r\n\r\n\"This Brotherhood of yours is well named the Terror; but was not that\r\nrather a murder than an execution?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" replied Colston, a trifle coldly. \"Society hangs or\r\nbeheads a man who kills another. Ainsworth knew as well as we did\r\nthat if the man he tried to betray by false evidence had once set\r\nfoot in Russia, the torments of a hundred deaths would have been his\r\nbefore he had been allowed to die.\r\n\r\n\"He betrayed his office and his faith to his English masters in order\r\nto commit this vile crime, and so he was killed as a murderous and\r\ntreacherous reptile that was not fit to live. We of the Terror are\r\nnot lawyers, and so we make no distinctions between deliberate\r\nplotting for money to kill and the act of killing itself. Our law is\r\ncloser akin to justice than the hair-splitting fraud that is\r\ntolerated by Society.\"\r\n\r\nEither from emotional or logical reasons Arnold made no reply to this\r\nreasoning, and, seeing he remained silent, Colston resumed his\r\nordinary nonchalant, good-humoured tone, and went on--\r\n\r\n\"But come, that will be horrors enough for to-day. We have other\r\nbusiness in hand, and we may as well get to it at once. About this\r\nwonderful invention of yours. Of course I believe all you have told\r\nme about it, but you must remember that I am only an agent, and that\r\nI am inexorably bound by certain rules, in accordance with which I\r\nmust act.\r\n\r\n\"Now, to be perfectly plain with you, and in order that we may\r\nthoroughly understand each other before either of us commits himself\r\nto anything, I must tell you that I want to see this model flying\r\nship of yours in order to be able to report on it to-night to the\r\nExecutive of the Inner Circle, to whom I shall also want to introduce\r\nyou. If you will not allow me to do that say so at once, and, for the\r\npresent at least, our negotiations must come to a sudden stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Arnold quietly; \"so far I consent. For the rest I would\r\nrather hear you to the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Then if the Executive approve of the invention, you will\r\nbe asked to join the Inner Circle at once, and to devote yourself\r\nbody and soul to the Society and the accomplishment of the objects\r\nthat will be explained to you. If you refuse there will be an end of\r\nthe matter, and you will simply be asked to give your word of honour\r\nto reveal nothing that you have seen or heard, and then allowed to\r\ndepart in peace.\r\n\r\n\"If, on the other hand, you consent, in consideration of the immense\r\nimportance of your secret--which there is no need to disguise from\r\nyou--to the Brotherhood, the usual condition of passing through the\r\nOuter Circle will be dispensed with, and you will be trusted as\r\nabsolutely as we shall expect you to trust us.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever funds you then require to manufacture an air-ship on the\r\nplan of your model will be placed at your disposal, and a suitable\r\nplace will be selected for the works that you will have to build.\r\nWhen the ship is ready to take the air you will, of course, be\r\nappointed to the command of her, and you will pick your crew from\r\namong the workmen who will act under your orders in the building of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\n\"They will all be members of the Outer Circle, who will not\r\nunderstand your orders, but simply obey them blindly, even to the\r\ndeath. One member of the Inner Circle will act as your second in\r\ncommand, and he will be as perfectly trusted as you will be, so that\r\nin unforeseen emergencies you will be able to consult with him with\r\nperfect confidence. Now I think I have told you all. What do you\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nArnold was silent for a few minutes, too busy for speech with the\r\nrush of thoughts that had crowded through his brain as Colston was\r\nspeaking. Then he looked up at his host and said--\r\n\r\n\"May I make conditions?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may state them,\" replied he, with a smile, \"but, of course, I\r\ndon't undertake to accept them without consultation with my--I mean\r\nwith the Executive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Arnold. \"Well, the conditions that I should\r\nfeel myself obliged to make with your Executive would be, briefly\r\nspeaking, these: I would not reveal to any one the composition of the\r\ngases from which I derive my motive force. I should manufacture them\r\nmyself in given quantities, and keep them always under my own charge.\r\n\r\n\"At the first attempt to break faith with me in this respect I would\r\nblow the air-ship and all her crew, including myself, into such\r\nfragments as it would be difficult to find one of them. I have and\r\nwish for no life apart from my invention, and I would not survive\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" interrupted Colston. \"There spoke the true enthusiast. Go\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, I would use the machine only in open warfare--when the\r\nBrotherhood is fighting openly for the attainment of a definite end.\r\nOnce the appeal to force has been made I will employ a force such as\r\nno nation on earth can use without me, and I will use it as\r\nunsparingly as the armies and fleets engaged will employ their own\r\nengines of destruction on one another. But I will be no party to the\r\ndestruction of defenceless towns and people who are not in arms\r\nagainst us. If I am ordered to do that I tell you candidly that I\r\nwill not do it. I will blow the air-ship itself up first.\"\r\n\r\n\"The conditions are somewhat stringent, although the sentiments are\r\nexcellent,\" replied Colston; \"still, of myself I can neither accept\r\nnor reject them. That will be for the Executive to do. For my own\r\npart I think that you will be able to arrive at a basis of agreement\r\non them. And now I think we have said all we can say for the present,\r\nand so if you are ready we'll be off and satisfy my longing to see\r\nthe invention that is to make us the arbiters of war--when war comes,\r\nwhich I fancy will not be long now.\"\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone in which these last words were spoken struck\r\nArnold with a kind of cold chill, and he shivered slightly as he said\r\nin answer to Colston--\r\n\r\n\"I am ready when you are, and no less anxious than you to set eyes on\r\nmy model. I hope to goodness it is all safe! Do you know, when I am\r\naway from it I feel just like a woman away from her first baby.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later two of the most dangerous enemies of Society\r\nalive were walking quietly along the Embankment towards Blackfriars,\r\nsmoking their cigars and chatting as conventionally as though there\r\nwere no such things on earth as tyranny and oppression, and their\r\nnecessarily ever-present enemies conspiracy and brooding revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE ON CLAPHAM COMMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes' walk took Arnold and Colston to the door of the\r\ntenement-house in which the former had lived since his fast-dwindling\r\nstore of money had convinced him of the necessity of bringing his\r\nexpenses down to the lowest possible limit if he wished to keep up\r\nthe struggle with fate very much longer.\r\n\r\nAs they mounted the dirty, evil-smelling staircase, Colston said--\r\n\r\n\"Phew! Verily you are a hero of science if you have brought yourself\r\nto live in a hole like this for a couple of years rather than give up\r\nyour dream, and grow fat on the loaves and fishes of\r\nconventionality.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a palace compared with some of the rookeries about here,\"\r\nreplied Arnold, with a laugh. \"The march of progress seems to have\r\nleft this half of London behind as hopeless. Ten years ago there were\r\na good many thousands of highly respectable mediocrities living on\r\nthis side of the river, but now I am told that the glory has departed\r\nfrom the very best of its localities, and given them up to various\r\ndegrees of squalor. Vice, poverty, and misery seem to gravitate\r\nnaturally southward in London. I don't know why, but they do. Well,\r\nhere is the door of my humble den.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he put the key in the lock, and opened the door, bidding\r\nhis companion enter as he did so.\r\n\r\nArnold's anxiety was soon relieved by finding the precious model\r\nuntouched in its resting-place, and it was at once brought out.\r\nColston was delighted beyond his powers of expression with the\r\nmarvellous ingenuity with which the miracle of mechanical skill was\r\ncontrived and put together; and when Arnold, after showing and\r\nexplaining to him all the various parts of the mechanism and the\r\nexternal structure, at length set the engine working, and the\r\nair-ship rose gracefully from the floor and began to sail round the\r\nroom in the wide circle to which it was confined by its mooring-line,\r\nhe stared at it for several minutes in wondering silence, following\r\nit round and round with his eyes, and then he said in a voice from\r\nwhich he vainly strove to banish the signs of the emotion that\r\npossessed him--\r\n\r\n\"It is the last miracle of science! With a few such ships as that one\r\ncould conquer the world in a month!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that would not be a very difficult task, seeing that neither an\r\narmy nor a fleet could exist for twelve hours with two or three of\r\nthem hovering above it,\" replied Arnold.\r\n\r\nThe trial over, Arnold set to work and took the model partly to\r\npieces for packing up; and while he was putting it away in the old\r\nsea-chest, Colston counted out ten sovereigns and laid them on the\r\ntable. Hearing the clink of the gold, Arnold looked up and said--\r\n\r\n\"What is that for? A sovereign will be quite enough to get me out of\r\nmy present scrape, and then if we come to any terms to-night it will\r\nbe time enough to talk about payment.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Brotherhood does not do business in that way,\" was the reply.\r\n\"At present your only connection with it is a commercial one, and ten\r\npounds is a very moderate fee for the privilege of inspecting such an\r\ninvention as this. Anyhow, that is what I am ordered to hand over to\r\nyou in payment for your trouble now and to-night, so you must accept\r\nit as it is given--as a matter of business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Arnold, closing and locking the chest as he spoke,\r\n\"if you think it worth ten pounds, the money will not come amiss to\r\nme. Now, if you will remain and guard the household gods for a\r\nminute, I will go and pay my rent and get a cab.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later his few but priceless possessions were loaded on a\r\nfour-wheeler and Arnold had bidden farewell for ever to the dingy\r\nroom in which he had passed so many hours of toil and dreaming,\r\nsuffering and disappointment. Before lunch time they were safely\r\nbestowed in a couple of rooms which Colston had engaged for him in\r\nthe same building in which his own rooms were.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, among other purchases, a more convenient case was\r\nbought for the model, and in this it was packed with the plans and\r\npapers which explained its construction, ready for the evening\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe two friends dined together at six in Colston's rooms, and at\r\nseven sharp his servant announced that the cab was at the door.\r\nWithin ten minutes they were bowling along the Embankment towards\r\nWestminster Bridge in a luxuriously appointed hansom of the newest\r\ntype, with the precious case lying across their knees.\r\n\r\n\"This is a comfortable cab,\" said Arnold, when they had gone a\r\nhundred yards or so. \"By the way, how does the man know where to go?\r\nI didn't hear you give him any directions.\"\r\n\r\n\"None were necessary,\" was the reply. \"This cab, like a good many\r\nothers in London, belongs to the Brotherhood, and the man who is\r\ndriving is one of the Outer Circle. Our Jehus are the most useful\r\nspies that we have. Many is the secret of the enemy that we have\r\nlearnt from, and many is the secret police agent who has been driven\r\nto his rendezvous by a Terrorist who has heard every word that has\r\nbeen spoken on the journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"How on earth is that managed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one of the cabs is fitted with a telephonic arrangement\r\ncommunicating with the roof. The driver has only to button the wire\r\nof the transmitter up inside his coat so that the transmitter itself\r\nlies near to his ear, and he can hear even a whisper inside the cab.\r\n\r\n\"The man who is driving us, for instance, has a sort of retainer from\r\nthe Russian Embassy to be on hand at certain hours on certain nights\r\nin the week. Our cabs are all better horsed, better appointed, and\r\nbetter driven than any others in London, and, consequently, they are\r\nfavourites, especially among the young attachés, and are nearly\r\nalways employed by them on their secret missions or love affairs,\r\nwhich, by the way, are very often the same thing. Our own Jehu has a\r\njob on to-night, from which we expect some results that will mystify\r\nthe enemy not a little. We got our first suspicions of Ainsworth from\r\na few incautious words that he spoke in one of our cabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a splendid system, I should think, for discovering the\r\nmovements of your enemies,\" said Arnold, not without an uncomfortable\r\nreflection on the fact that he was himself now completely in the\r\npower of this terrible organisation, which had keen eyes and ready\r\nhands in every capital of the civilised world. \"But how do you guard\r\nagainst treachery? It is well known that all the Governments of\r\nEurope are spending money like water to unearth this mystery of the\r\nTerror. Surely all your men cannot be incorruptible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Practically they are so. The very mystery which enshrouds all our\r\nactions makes them so. We have had a few traitors, of course; but as\r\nnone of them has ever survived his treachery by twenty-four hours, a\r\nbribe has lost its attraction for the rest.\"\r\n\r\nIn such conversation as this the time was passed, while the cab\r\ncrossed the river and made its way rapidly and easily along\r\nKennington Road and Clapham Road to Clapham Common. At length it\r\nturned into the drive of one of those solid abodes of pretentious\r\nrespectability which front the Common, and pulled up before a big\r\nstucco portico.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are!\" exclaimed Colston, as the doors of the cab\r\nautomatically opened. He got out first, and Arnold handed the case to\r\nhim, and then followed him.\r\n\r\nWithout a word the driver turned his horse into the road again and\r\ndrove off towards town, and as they ascended the steps the front door\r\nopened, and they went in, Colston saying as they did so--\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Smith at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; you are expected, I believe. Will you step into the\r\ndrawing-room?\" replied the clean-shaven and immaculately respectable\r\nman-servant, in evening dress, who had opened the door for them.\r\n\r\nThey were shown into a handsomely furnished room lit with electric\r\nlight. As soon as the footman had closed the door behind him, Colston\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, here you are in the conspirators' den, in the very\r\nheadquarters of those Terrorists for whom Europe is being ransacked\r\nconstantly without the slightest success. I have often wondered what\r\nthe rigid respectability of Clapham Common would think if it knew the\r\ntrue character of this harmless-looking house. I hardly think an\r\nearthquake in Clapham Road would produce much more sensation than\r\nsuch a discovery would.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" he continued, his tone becoming suddenly much more\r\nserious, \"in a few minutes you will be in the presence of the Inner\r\nCircle of the Terrorists, that is to say, of those who practically\r\nhold the fate of Europe in their hands. You know pretty clearly what\r\nthey want with you. If you have thought better of the business that\r\nwe have discussed you are still at perfect liberty to retire from it,\r\non giving your word of honour not to disclose anything that I have\r\nsaid to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not the slightest intention of doing anything of the sort,\"\r\nreplied Arnold. \"You know the conditions on which I came here. I\r\nshall put them before your Council, and if they are accepted your\r\nBrotherhood will, within their limits, have no more faithful adherent\r\nthan I. If not, the business will simply come to an end as far as I\r\nam concerned, and your secret will be as safe with me as though I had\r\ntaken the oath of membership.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said!\" replied Colston, \"and just what I expected you to say.\r\nNow listen to me for a minute. Whatever you may see or hear for the\r\nnext few minutes say nothing till you are asked to speak. I will say\r\nall that is necessary at first. Ask no questions, but trust to\r\nanything that may seem strange being explained in due course--as it\r\nwill be. A single indiscretion on your part might raise suspicions\r\nwhich would be as dangerous as they would be unfounded. When you are\r\nasked to speak do so without the slightest fear, and speak your mind\r\nas openly as you have done to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need have no fear for me,\" replied Arnold. \"I think I am\r\nsensible enough to be prudent, and I am quite sure that I am\r\ndesperate enough to be fearless. Little worse can happen to me than\r\nthe fate that I was contemplating last night.\"\r\n\r\nAs he ceased speaking there was a knock at the door. It opened and\r\nthe footman reappeared, saying in the most commonplace fashion--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smith will be happy to see you now, gentlemen. Will you kindly\r\nwalk this way?\"\r\n\r\nThey followed him out into the hall, and then, somewhat to Arnold's\r\nsurprise, down the stairs at the back, which apparently led to the\r\nbasement of the house.\r\n\r\nThe footman preceded them to the basement floor and halted before a\r\ndoor in a little passage that looked like the entrance to a coal\r\ncellar. On this he knocked in peculiar fashion with the knuckles of\r\none hand, while with the other he pressed the button of an electric\r\nbell concealed under the paper on the wall. The bell sounded faintly\r\nas though some distance off, and as it rang the footman said abruptly\r\nto Colston--\r\n\r\n\"Das Wort ist Freiheit.\"\r\n\r\nArnold knew German enough to know that this meant \"The word is\r\n'Freedom,'\" but why it should have been spoken in a foreign language\r\nmystified him not a little.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thinking about this the door opened, as if by a released\r\nspring, and he saw before him a long, narrow passage, lit by four\r\nelectric arcs, and closed at the other end by a door, guarded by a\r\nsentry armed with a magazine rifle.\r\n\r\nHe followed Colston down the passage, and when within a dozen feet of\r\nthe sentry, he brought his rifle to the \"ready,\" and the following\r\nstrange dialogue ensued between him and Colston--\r\n\r\n\"Quien va?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zwei Freunde der Bruderschaft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Por la libertad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Für Freiheit über alles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pass, friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe rifle grounded as the words were spoken, and the sentry stepped\r\nback to the wall of the passage.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment another bell rang beyond the door, and then the\r\ndoor itself opened as the other had done.\r\n\r\nThey passed through, and it closed instantly behind them, leaving\r\nthem in total darkness.\r\n\r\nColston caught Arnold by the arm, and drew him towards him, saying as\r\nhe did so--\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of our system of passwords?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty hard to get through unless one knew them, I should think. Why\r\nthe different languages?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make assurance doubly sure every member of the Inner Circle must\r\nbe conversant with four European languages. On these the changes are\r\nrung, and even I did not know what the two languages were to be\r\nto-night before I entered the house, and if I had asked for 'Mr.\r\nBrown' instead of 'Mr. Smith,' we should never have got beyond the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"When the footman told me in German that the word was 'Freedom,' I\r\nknew that I should have to answer the challenge of the sentry in\r\nGerman. I did not know that he would challenge in Spanish, and if I\r\nhad not understood him, or had replied in any other language but\r\nGerman, he would have shot us both down without saying another word,\r\nand no one would ever have known what had become of us. You will be\r\nexempt from this condition, because you will always come with me. I\r\nam, in fact, responsible for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm, there doesn't seem much chance of any one getting through on\r\nfalse pretences,\" replied Arnold, with an irrepressible shudder. \"Has\r\nany one ever tried?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, once. The two gentlemen whose disappearance made the famous\r\n'Clapham Mystery' of about twelve months ago. They were two of the\r\nsmartest detectives in the French service, and the only two men who\r\never guessed the true nature of this house. They are buried under the\r\nfloor on which you are standing at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken with a cruel inflexible coldness, which struck\r\nArnold like a blast of frozen air. He shivered, and was about to\r\nreply when Colston caught him by the arm again, and said hurriedly--\r\n\r\n\"H'st! We are going in. Remember what I said, and don't speak again\r\ntill some one asks you to do so.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a door opened in the wall of the dark chamber in which\r\nthey had been standing for the last few minutes, and a flood of soft\r\nlight flowed in upon their dazzled eyes. At the same moment a man's\r\nvoice said from the room beyond in Russian--\r\n\r\n\"Who stands there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maurice Colston and the Master of the Air,\" replied Colston in the\r\nsame language.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome,\" was the reply, and then Colston, taking Arnold by\r\nthe arm, led him into the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE INNER CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Arnold's eyes got accustomed to the light, he saw that he\r\nwas in a large, lofty room with panelled walls adorned with a number\r\nof fine paintings. As he looked at these his gaze was fascinated by\r\nthem, even more than by the strange company which was assembled round\r\nthe long table that occupied the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nThough they were all manifestly the products of the highest form of\r\nart, their subjects were dreary and repulsive beyond description.\r\nThere was a horrible realism about them which reminded him\r\nirresistibly of the awful collection of pictorial horrors in the\r\nMusée Wiertz, in Brussels--those works of the brilliant but unhappy\r\ngenius who was driven into insanity by the sheer exuberance of his\r\nown morbid imagination.\r\n\r\nHere was a long line of men and women in chains staggering across a\r\nwilderness of snow that melted away into the horizon without a break.\r\nBeside them rode Cossacks armed with long whips that they used on men\r\nand women alike when their fainting limbs gave way beneath them, and\r\nthey were like to fall by the wayside to seek the welcome rest that\r\nonly death could give them.\r\n\r\nThere was a picture of a woman naked to the waist, and tied up to a\r\ntriangle in a prison yard, being flogged by a soldier with willow\r\nwands, while a group of officers stood by, apparently greatly\r\ninterested in the performance. Another painting showed a poor wretch\r\nbeing knouted to death in the market-place of a Russian town, and yet\r\nanother showed a young and beautiful woman in a prison cell with her\r\nface distorted by the horrible leer of madness, and her little white\r\nhands clawing nervously at her long dishevelled hair.\r\n\r\nArnold stood for several minutes fascinated by the hideous realism of\r\nthe pictures, and burning with rage and shame at the thought that\r\nthey were all too terribly true to life, when he was startled out of\r\nhis reverie by the same voice that had called them from the dark room\r\nsaying to him in English--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Richard Arnold, what do you think of our little picture\r\ngallery? The paintings are good in themselves, but it may make them\r\nmore interesting to you if you know that they are all faithful\r\nreproductions of scenes that have really taken place within the\r\nlimits of the so-called civilised and Christian world. There are some\r\nhere in this room now who have suffered the torments depicted on\r\nthose canvases, and who could tell of worse horrors than even they\r\nportray. We should like to know what you think of our paintings?\"\r\n\r\nArnold glanced towards the table in search of Colston, but he had\r\nvanished. Around the long table sat fourteen masked and shrouded\r\nforms that were absolutely indistinguishable one from the other. He\r\ncould not even tell whether they were men or women, so closely were\r\ntheir forms and faces concealed. Seeing that he was left to his own\r\ndiscretion, he laid the case containing the model, which he had so\r\nfar kept under his arm, down on the floor, and, facing the strange\r\nassembly, said as steadily as he could--\r\n\r\n\"My own reading tells me that they are only too true to the dreadful\r\nreality. I think that the civilised and Christian Society which\r\npermits such crimes to be committed against humanity, when it has the\r\npower to stop them by force of arms, is neither truly civilised nor\r\ntruly Christian.\"\r\n\r\n\"And would _you_ stop them if you could?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if it cost the lives of millions to do it! They would be better\r\nspent than the thirty million lives that were lost last century over\r\na few bits of territory.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, and augurs well for our future agreement. Be kind\r\nenough to come to the table and take a seat.\"\r\n\r\nThe masked man who spoke was sitting in the chair at the foot of the\r\ntable, and as he said this one of those sitting at the side got up\r\nand motioned to Arnold to take his place. As soon as he had done so\r\nthe speaker continued--\r\n\r\n\"We are glad to see that your sentiments are so far in accord with\r\nour own, for that fact will make our negotiations all the easier.\r\n\r\n\"As you are aware, you are now in the Inner Circle of the Terrorists.\r\nYonder empty chair at the head of the table is that of our Chief,\r\nwho, though not with us in person, is ever present as a guiding\r\ninfluence in our councils. We act as he directs, and it was from him\r\nthat we received news of you and your marvellous invention. It is\r\nalso by his direction that you have been invited here to-night with\r\nan object that you are already aware of.\r\n\r\n\"I see from your face that you are about to ask how this can be,\r\nseeing that you have never confided your secret to any one until last\r\nnight. It will be useless to ask me, for I myself do not know. We who\r\nsit here simply execute the Master's will. We ask no questions, and\r\ntherefore we can answer none concerning him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none to ask,\" said Arnold, seeing that the speaker paused as\r\nthough expecting him to say something. \"I came at the invitation of\r\none of your Brotherhood to lay certain terms before you, for you to\r\naccept or reject as seems good to you. How you got to know of me and\r\nmy invention is, after all, a matter of indifference to me. With your\r\nperfect system of espionage you might well find out more secret\r\nthings than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" was the reply. \"And the question that we have to settle\r\nwith you is how far you will consent to assist the work of the\r\nBrotherhood with this invention of yours, and on what conditions you\r\nwill do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must first know as exactly as possible what the work of the\r\nBrotherhood is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the circumstances there is no objection to your knowing that.\r\nIn the first place, that which is known to the outside world as the\r\nTerror is an international secret society underlying and directing\r\nthe operations of the various bodies known as Nihilists, Anarchists,\r\nSocialists--in fact, all those organisations which have for their\r\nobject the reform or destruction, by peaceful or violent means, of\r\nSociety as it is at present constituted.\r\n\r\n\"Its influence reaches beyond these into the various trade unions and\r\npolitical clubs, the moving spirits of which are all members of our\r\nOuter Circle. On the other side of Society we have agents and\r\nadherents in all the Courts of Europe, all the diplomatic bodies, and\r\nall the parliamentary assemblies throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that Society as at present constituted is hopeless for\r\nany good thing. All kinds of nameless brutalities are practised\r\nwithout reproof in the names of law and order, and commercial\r\neconomics. On one side human life is a splendid fabric of cloth of\r\ngold embroidered with priceless gems, and on the other it is a mass\r\nof filthy, festering rags, swarming with vermin.\r\n\r\n\"We think that such a Society--a Society which permits considerably\r\nmore than the half of humanity to be sunk in poverty and misery while\r\na very small portion of it fools away its life in perfectly\r\nridiculous luxury--does not deserve to exist, and ought to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\"We also know that sooner or later it will destroy itself, as every\r\nsimilar Society has done before it. For nearly forty years there has\r\nnow been almost perfect peace in Europe. At the same time, over\r\ntwenty millions of men are standing ready to take the field in a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\"War--universal war that will shake the world to its foundations--is\r\nonly a matter of a little more delay and a few diplomatic hitches.\r\nRussia and England are within rifleshot of each other in Afghanistan,\r\nand France and Germany are flinging defiances at each other across\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\n\"Some one must soon fire the shot that will set the world in a blaze,\r\nand meanwhile the toilers of the earth are weary of these dreadful\r\nmilitary and naval burdens, and would care very little if the\r\ninevitable happened to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"It is in the power of the Terrorists to delay or precipitate that\r\nwar to a certain extent. Hitherto all our efforts have been devoted\r\nto the preservation of peace, and many of the so-called outrages\r\nwhich have taken place in different parts of Europe, and especially\r\nin Russia, during the last few years, have been accomplished simply\r\nfor the purpose of forcing the attention of the administrations to\r\ninternal affairs for the time, and so putting off what would have led\r\nto a declaration of war.\r\n\r\n\"This policy has not been dictated by any hope of avoiding war\r\naltogether, for that would have been sheer insanity. We have simply\r\ndelayed war as long as possible, because we have not felt that we\r\nhave been strong enough to turn the tide of battle at the right\r\nmoment in favour of the oppressed ones of the earth and against their\r\noppressors.\r\n\r\n\"But this invention of yours puts a completely different aspect on\r\nthe European situation. Armed with such a tremendous engine of\r\ndestruction as a navigable air-ship must necessarily be, when used in\r\nconjunction with the explosives already at our disposal, we could\r\nmake war impossible to our enemies by bringing into the field a force\r\nwith which no army or fleet could contend without the certainty of\r\ndestruction. By these means we should ultimately compel peace and\r\nenforce a general disarmament on land and sea.\r\n\r\n\"The vast majority of those who make the wealth of the world are sick\r\nof seeing that wealth wasted in the destruction of human life, and\r\nthe ruin of peaceful industries. As soon, therefore, as we are in a\r\nposition to dictate terms under such tremendous penalties, all the\r\ninnumerable organisations with which we are in touch all over the\r\nworld will rise in arms and enforce them at all costs.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it goes without saying that the powers that are now\r\nenthroned in the high places of the world will fight bitterly and\r\ndesperately to retain the rule that they have held for so long, but\r\nin the end we shall be victorious, and then on the ruins of this\r\ncivilisation a new and a better shall arise.\r\n\r\n\"That is a rough, brief outline of the policy of the Brotherhood,\r\nwhich we are going to ask you to-night to join. Of course, in the\r\neyes of the world we are only a set of fiends, whose sole object is\r\nthe destruction of Society, and the inauguration of a state of\r\nuniversal anarchy. That, however, has no concern for us. What is\r\ncalled popular opinion is merely manufactured by the Press according\r\nto order, and does not count in serious concerns. What I have\r\ndescribed to you are the true objects of the Brotherhood; and now it\r\nremains for you to say, yes or no, whether you will devote yourself\r\nand your invention to carrying them out or not.\"\r\n\r\nFor two or three minutes after the masked spokesman of the Inner\r\nCircle had ceased speaking, there was absolute silence in the room.\r\nThe calmly spoken words which deliberately sketched out the ruin of a\r\ncivilisation and the establishment of a new order of things made a\r\ndeep impression on Arnold's mind. He saw clearly that he was standing\r\nat the parting of the ways, and facing the most tremendous crisis\r\nthat could occur in the life of a human being.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that he should look back, as he did, to the life\r\nfrom which a single step would now part him for ever, without the\r\npossibility of going back. He knew that if he once put his hands to\r\nthe plough, and looked back, death, swift and inevitable, would be\r\nthe penalty of his wavering. This, however, he had already weighed\r\nand decided.\r\n\r\nMost of what he had heard had found an echo in his own convictions.\r\nMoreover, the life that he had left had no charms for him, while to\r\nbe one of the chief factors in a world-revolution was a destiny\r\nworthy both of himself and his invention. So the fatal resolution was\r\ntaken, and he spoke the words that bound him for ever to the\r\nBrotherhood.\r\n\r\n\"As I have already told Mr. Colston,\" he began by saying, \"I will\r\njoin and faithfully serve the Brotherhood if the conditions that I\r\nfeel compelled to make are granted\"--\r\n\r\n\"We know them already,\" interrupted the spokesman, \"and they are\r\nfreely granted. Indeed, you can hardly fail to see that we are\r\ntrusting you to a far greater extent than it is possible for us to\r\nmake you trust us, unless you choose to do so. The air-ship once\r\nbuilt and afloat under your command, the game of war would to a great\r\nextent be in your own hands. True, you would not survive treachery\r\nvery long; but, on the other hand, if it became necessary to kill\r\nyou, the air-ship would be useless, that is, if you took your secret\r\nof the motive power with you into the next world.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I undoubtedly should,\" added Arnold quietly.\r\n\r\n\"We have no doubt that you would,\" was the equally quiet rejoinder.\r\n\"And now I will read to you the oath of membership that you will be\r\nrequired to sign. Even when you have heard it, if you feel any\r\nhesitation in subscribing to it, there will still be time to\r\nwithdraw, for we tolerate no unwilling or half-hearted recruits.\"\r\n\r\nArnold bowed his acquiescence, and the spokesman took a piece of\r\npaper from the table and read aloud--\r\n\r\n\"_I, Richard Arnold, sign this paper in the full knowledge that in\r\ndoing so I devote myself absolutely for the rest of my life to the\r\nservice of the Brotherhood of Freedom, known to the world as the\r\nTerrorists. As long as I live its ends shall be my ends, and no human\r\nconsiderations shall weigh with me where those ends are concerned. I\r\nwill take life without mercy, and yield my own without hesitation at\r\nits bidding. I will break all other laws to obey those which it\r\nobeys, and if I disobey these I shall expect death as the just\r\npenalty of my perjury._\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished reading the oath, he handed the paper to Arnold,\r\nsaying as he did so--\r\n\r\n\"There are no theatrical formalities to be gone through. Simply sign\r\nthe paper and give it back to me, or else tear it up and go in\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nArnold read it through slowly, and then glanced round the table. He\r\nsaw the eyes of the silent figures sitting about him shining at him\r\nthrough the holes in their masks. He laid the paper down on the table\r\nin front of him, dipped a pen in an inkstand that stood near, and\r\nsigned the oath in a firm, unfaltering hand. Then--committed for\r\never, for good or evil, to the new life that he had adopted--he gave\r\nthe paper back again.\r\n\r\nThe President took it and read it, and then passed it to the mask on\r\nhis right hand. It went from one to the other round the table, each\r\none reading it before passing it on, until it got back to the\r\nPresident. When it reached him he rose from his seat, and, going to\r\nthe fireplace, dropped it into the flames, and watched it until it\r\nwas consumed to ashes. Then, crossing the room to where Arnold was\r\nsitting, he removed his mask with one hand, and held the other out to\r\nhim in greeting, saying as he did so--\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to the Brotherhood! Thrice welcome! for your coming has\r\nbrought the day of redemption nearer!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nNEW FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Arnold returned the greeting of the President, all the other\r\nmembers of the Circle rose from their seats and took off their masks\r\nand the black shapeless cloaks which had so far completely covered\r\nthem from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThen, one after the other, they came forward and were formally\r\nintroduced to him by the President. Nine of the fourteen were men,\r\nand five were women of ages varying from middle age almost to\r\ngirlhood. The men were apparently all between twenty-five and\r\nthirty-five, and included some half-dozen nationalities among them.\r\n\r\nAll, both men and women, evidently belonged to the educated, or\r\nrather to the cultured class. Their speech, which seemed to change\r\nwith perfect ease from one language to another in the course of their\r\nsomewhat polyglot converse, was the easy flowing speech of men and\r\nwomen accustomed to the best society, not only in the social but the\r\nintellectual sense of the word.\r\n\r\nAll were keen, alert, and swift of thought, and on the face of each\r\none there was the dignifying expression of a deep and settled purpose\r\nwhich at once differentiated them in Arnold's eyes from the ordinary\r\nidle or merely money-making citizens of the world.\r\n\r\nAs each one came and shook hands with the new member of the\r\nBrotherhood, he or she had some pleasant word of welcome and greeting\r\nfor him; and so well were the words chosen, and so manifestly\r\nsincerely were they spoken, that by the time he had shaken hands all\r\nround Arnold felt as much at home among them as though he were in the\r\nmidst of a circle of old friends.\r\n\r\nAmong the women there were two who had attracted his attention and\r\nroused his interest far more than any of the other members of the\r\nCircle. One of these was a tall and beautifully-shaped woman, whose\r\nface and figure were those of a woman in the early twenties, but\r\nwhose long, thick hair was as white as though the snows of seventy\r\nwinters had drifted over it. As he returned her warm, firm\r\nhand-clasp, and looked upon her dark, resolute, and yet perfectly\r\nwomanly features, the young engineer gave a slight start of\r\nrecognition. She noticed this at once and said, with a smile and a\r\nquick flash from her splendid grey eyes--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I see you recognise me. No, I am not ashamed of my portrait. I\r\nam proud of the wounds that I have received in the war with tyranny,\r\nso you need not fear to confess your recognition.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true that Arnold had recognised her. She was the original of\r\nthe central figure of the painting which depicted the woman being\r\nflogged by the Russian soldiers.\r\n\r\nArnold flushed hotly at the words with the sudden passionate anger\r\nthat they roused within him, and replied in a low, steady voice--\r\n\r\n\"Those who would sanction such a crime as that are not fit to live. I\r\nwill not leave one stone of that prison standing upon another. It is\r\na blot on the face of the earth, and I will wipe it out utterly!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are thousands of blots as black as that on earth, and I think\r\nyou will find nobler game than an obscure Russian provincial prison.\r\nRussia has cities and palaces and fortresses that will make far\r\ngrander ruins than that--ruins that will be worthy monuments of\r\nfallen despotism,\" replied the girl, who had been introduced by the\r\nPresident as Radna Michaelis. \"But here is some one else waiting to\r\nmake your acquaintance. This is Natasha. She has no other name among\r\nus, but you will soon learn why she needs none.\"\r\n\r\nNatasha was the other woman who had so keenly roused Arnold's\r\ninterest. Woman, however, she hardly was, for she was seemingly still\r\nin her teens, and certainly could not have been more than twenty.\r\n\r\nHe had mixed but little with women, and during the past few years not\r\nat all, and therefore the marvellous beauty of the girl who came\r\nforward as Radna spoke seemed almost unearthly to him, and confused\r\nhis senses for the moment as some potent drug might have done. He\r\ntook her outstretched hand in awkward silence, and for an instant so\r\nfar forgot himself as to gaze blankly at her in speechless\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nShe could not help noticing it, for she was a woman, and for the same\r\nreason she saw that it was so absolutely honest and involuntary that\r\nit was impossible for any woman to take offence at it. A quick bright\r\nflush swept up her lovely face as his hand closed upon hers, her\r\ndarkly-fringed lids fell for an instant over the most wonderful pair\r\nof sapphire-blue eyes that Arnold had ever even dreamed of, and when\r\nshe raised them again the flush had gone, and she said in a sweet,\r\nfrank voice--\r\n\r\n\"I am the daughter of Natas, and he has desired me to bid you welcome\r\nin his name, and I hope you will let me do so in my own as well. We\r\nare all dying to see this wonderful invention of yours. I suppose you\r\nare going to satisfy our feminine curiosity, are you not?\"\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Natas! This lovely girl, in the first sweet flush of\r\nher pure and innocent womanhood, the daughter of the unknown and\r\nmysterious being whose ill-omened name caused a shudder if it was\r\nonly whispered in the homes of the rich and powerful; the name with\r\nwhich the death-sentences of the Terrorists were invariably signed,\r\nand which had come to be an infallible guarantee that they would be\r\ncarried out to the letter.\r\n\r\nNo death-warrants of the most powerful sovereigns of Europe were more\r\ncertain harbingers of inevitable doom than were those which bore this\r\ndreaded name. Whether he were high or low, the man who received one\r\nof them made ready for his end. He knew not where or when the fatal\r\nblow would be struck. He only knew that the invisible hand of the\r\nTerror would strike him as surely in the uttermost ends of the earth\r\nas it would in the palace or the fortress. Never once had it missed\r\nits aim, and never once had the slightest clue been obtained to the\r\nidentity of the hand that held the knife or pistol.\r\n\r\nSome such thoughts as these flashed one after another through\r\nArnold's brain as he stood talking with Natasha. He saw at once why\r\nshe had only that one name. It was enough, and it was not long before\r\nhe learnt that it was the symbol of an authority in the Circle that\r\nadmitted of no question.\r\n\r\nShe was the envoy of him whose word was law, absolute and\r\nirrevocable, to every member of the Brotherhood; to disobey whom was\r\ndeath; and to obey whom had, so far at least, meant swift and\r\ninvariable success, even where it seemed least to be hoped for.\r\n\r\nOf course, Natasha's almost girlish question about the air-ship was\r\nreally a command, which would have been none the less binding had she\r\nonly had her own beauty to enforce it. As she spoke the President and\r\nColston--who had only lost himself for the time behind a mask and\r\ncloak--came up to Arnold and asked him if he was prepared to give an\r\nexhibition of the powers of his model, and to explain its working and\r\nconstruction to the Circle at once.\r\n\r\nHe replied that everything was perfectly ready for the trial, and\r\nthat he would set the model working for them in a few minutes. The\r\nPresident then told him that the exhibition should take place in\r\nanother room, where there would be much more space than where they\r\nwere, and bade him bring the box and follow him.\r\n\r\nA door was now opened in the wall of the room remote from that by\r\nwhich he and Colston had entered, and through this the whole party\r\nwent down a short passage, and through another door at the end which\r\nopened into a very large apartment, which, from the fact of its being\r\nwindowless, Arnold rightly judged to be underground, like the\r\nCouncil-chamber that they had just left.\r\n\r\nA single glance was enough to show him the chief purpose to which the\r\nchamber was devoted. The wall at one end was covered with arm-racks\r\ncontaining all the newest and most perfect makes of rifles and\r\npistols; while at the other end, about twenty paces distant, were\r\nthree electric signalling targets, graded, as was afterwards\r\nexplained to him, to one, three, and five hundred yards range.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the chamber was an underground range for rifle and pistol\r\npractice, in which a volley could have been fired without a sound\r\nbeing heard ten yards away. It was here that the accuracy of the\r\nvarious weapons invented from time to time was tested; and here, too,\r\nevery member of the Circle, man and woman, practised with rifle and\r\npistol until an infallible aim was acquired. A register of scores was\r\nkept, and at the head of it stood the name of Radna Michaelis.\r\n\r\nA long table ran across the end at which the arm-racks were, and on\r\nthis Arnold laid the case containing the model, he standing on one\r\nside of the table, and the members of the Circle on the other,\r\nwatching his movements with a curiosity that they took no trouble to\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\nHe opened the case, feeling something like a scientific demonstrator,\r\nwith an advanced and critical class before him. In a moment the man\r\ndisappeared, and the mechanician and the enthusiast took his place.\r\nAs each part was taken out and laid upon the table, he briefly\r\nexplained its use; and then, last of all, came the hull of the\r\nair-ship.\r\n\r\nThis was three feet long and six inches broad in its midships\r\ndiameter. It was made in two longitudinal sections of polished\r\naluminium, which shone like burnished silver. It would have been\r\ncigar-shaped but for the fact that the forward end was drawn out into\r\na long sharp ram, the point of which was on a level with the floor of\r\nthe hull amidships as it lay upon the table. Two deep bilge-plates,\r\nrunning nearly the whole length of the hull, kept it in an upright\r\nposition and prevented the blades of the propellers from touching the\r\ntable. For about half its whole length the upper part of the hull was\r\nflattened and formed a deck from which rose three short strong masts,\r\neach of which carried a wheel of thin metal whose spokes were six\r\ninclined fans something like the blades of a screw.\r\n\r\nA little lower than this deck there projected on each side a broad,\r\noblong, slightly curved sheet of metal, very thin, but strengthened\r\nby means of wire braces, till it was as rigid as a plate of solid\r\nsteel, although it only weighed a few ounces. These air-planes worked\r\non an axis amidships, and could be inclined either way through an\r\nangle of thirty degrees. At the pointed stern there revolved a\r\npowerful four-bladed propeller, and from each quarter, inclined\r\nslightly outwards from the middle line of the vessel, projected a\r\nsomewhat smaller screw working underneath the after end of the\r\nair-planes.\r\n\r\nThe hull contained four small double-cylinder engines, one of which\r\nactuated the stern-propeller, and the other three the fan-wheels and\r\nside-propellers. There were, of course, no furnaces, boilers, or\r\ncondensers. Two slender pipes ran into each cylinder from suitably\r\nplaced gas reservoirs, or power-cylinders, as the engineer called\r\nthem, and that was all.\r\n\r\nArnold deftly and rapidly put the parts together, continuing his\r\nrunning description as he did so, and in a few minutes the beautiful\r\nmiracle of ingenuity stood complete before the wondering eyes of the\r\nCircle, and a murmur of admiration ran from lip to lip, bringing a\r\nflush of pleasure to the cheek of its creator.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said he, as he put the finishing touches to the apparatus,\r\n\"you see that she is a combination of two principles--those of the\r\nAëronef and the Aëroplane. The first reached its highest development\r\nin Jules Verne's imaginary \"Clipper of the Clouds,\" and the second in\r\nHiram Maxim's Aëroplane. Of course, Jules Verne's Aëronef was merely\r\nan idea, and one that could never be realised while Robur's\r\nmysterious source of electrical energy remained unknown--as it still\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\n\"Maxim's Aëroplane is, as you all know, also an unrealised ideal so\r\nfar as any practical use is concerned. He has succeeded in making it\r\nfly, but only under the most favourable conditions, and practically\r\nwithout cargo. Its two fatal defects have been shown by experience to\r\nbe the comparatively overwhelming weight of the engine and the fuel\r\nthat he has to carry to develop sufficient power to rise from the\r\nground and progress against the wind, and the inability of the\r\nmachine to ascend perpendicularly to any required height.\r\n\r\n\"Without the power to do this no air-ship can be of any use save\r\nunder very limited conditions. You cannot carry a railway about with\r\nyou, or a station to get a start from every time you want to rise,\r\nand you cannot always choose a nice level plain in which to come\r\ndown. Even if you could the Aëroplane would not rise again without\r\nits rails and carriage. For purposes of warfare, then, it may be\r\ndismissed as totally useless.\r\n\r\n\"In this machine, as you see, I have combined the two principles.\r\nThese helices on the masts will lift the dead weight of the ship\r\nperpendicularly without the slightest help from the side-planes,\r\nwhich are used to regulate the vessel's flight when afloat. I will\r\nset the engines that work them in motion independently of the others\r\nwhich move the propellers, and then you will see what I mean.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he set one part of the mechanism working. Those watching\r\nsaw the three helices begin to spin round, the centre one revolving\r\nin an opposite direction to the other two, with a soft whirring sound\r\nthat gradually rose to a high-pitched note.\r\n\r\nWhen they attained their full speed they looked like solid wheels,\r\nand then the air-ship rose, at first slowly, and then more and more\r\nswiftly, straight up from the table, until it strained hard at the\r\npiece of cord which prevented it from reaching the roof.\r\n\r\nA universal chorus of \"bravas\" greeted it as it rose, and every eye\r\nbecame fixed on it as it hung motionless in the air, sustained by its\r\nwhirling helices. After letting it remain aloft for a few minutes\r\nArnold pulled it down again, saying as he did so--\r\n\r\n\"That, I think, proves that the machine can rise from any position\r\nwhere the upward road is open, and without the slightest assistance\r\nof any apparatus. Now it shall take a voyage round the room.\r\n\r\n\"You see it is steered by this rudder-fan under the stern propeller.\r\nIn the real ship it will be worked by a wheel, like the rudder of a\r\nsea-going vessel; but in the model it is done by this lever, so that\r\nI can control it by a couple of strings from the ground.\"\r\n\r\nHe went round to the other side of the table while he was speaking,\r\nand adjusted the steering gear, stopping the engines meanwhile. Then\r\nhe put the model down on the floor, set all four engines to work, and\r\nstood behind with the guiding-strings in his hands. The spectators\r\nheard a louder and somewhat shriller whirring noise than before, and\r\nthe beautiful fabric, with its shining, silvery hull and side-planes,\r\nrose slantingly from the ground and darted forward down the room,\r\nkeeping Arnold at a quick run with the rudder-strings tightly\r\nstrained.\r\n\r\nLike an obedient steed, it instantly obeyed the slightest pull upon\r\neither of them, and twice made the circuit of the room before its\r\ncreator pulled it down and stopped the machinery.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was a perfect and undeniable success in every respect,\r\nand not one of those who saw it had the slightest doubt as to\r\nArnold's air-ship having at last solved the problem of aërial\r\nnavigation, and made the Brotherhood lords of a realm as wide as the\r\natmospheric ocean that encircles the globe.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the model was once more resting on the table, the\r\nPresident came forward and, grasping the engineer by both hands, said\r\nin a voice from which he made but little effort to banish the emotion\r\nthat he felt--\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, brother! Henceforth you shall be known to the Brotherhood as\r\nthe Master of the Air, for truly you have been the first among the\r\nsons of men to fairly conquer it. Come, let us go back and talk, for\r\nthere is much to be said about this, and we cannot begin too soon to\r\nmake arrangements for building the first of our aërial fleet. You can\r\nleave your model where it is in perfect safety, for no one ever\r\nenters this room save ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying the President led the way to the Council-chamber, and\r\nthere, after the _Ariel_--as it had already been decided to name the\r\nfirst air-ship--had been christened in anticipation in twenty-year\r\nold champagne, the Circle settled down at once to business, and for a\r\ngood three hours discussed the engineer's estimate and plans for\r\nbuilding the first vessel of the aërial fleet.\r\n\r\nAt length all the practical details were settled, and the President\r\nrose in token of the end of the conference. As he did so he said\r\nsomewhat abruptly to Arnold--\r\n\r\n\"So far so good. Now there is nothing more to be done but to lay\r\nthose plans before the Chief and get his authority for withdrawing\r\nout of the treasury sufficient money to commence operations. I\r\npresume you could reproduce them from memory if necessary--at any\r\nrate, in sufficient outline to make them perfectly intelligible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"I could reproduce them in _fac simile_\r\nwithout the slightest difficulty. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the Chief is in Russia, and you must go to him and place\r\nthem before him from memory. They are far too precious to be trusted\r\nto any keeping, however trustworthy. There are such things as railway\r\naccidents, and other forms of sudden death, to say nothing of the\r\nRussian customs, false arrests, personal searches, and imprisonments\r\non mere suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"We can risk none of these, and so there is nothing for it but your\r\ngoing to Petersburg and verbally explaining them to the Chief. You\r\ncan be ready in three days, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in two, if you like,\" replied Arnold, not a little taken aback\r\nat the unexpected suddenness of what he knew at once to be the first\r\norder that was to test his obedience to the Brotherhood. \"But as I am\r\nabsolutely ignorant of Russia and the Russians, I suppose you will\r\nmake such arrangements as will prevent my making any innocent but\r\npossibly awkward mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" replied the President, with a smile, \"all arrangements have\r\nbeen made already, and I expect you will find them anything but\r\nunpleasant. Natasha goes to Petersburg in company with another lady\r\nmember of the Circle whom you have not yet seen.\r\n\r\n\"You will go with them, and they will explain everything to you _en\r\nroute_, if they have no opportunity of doing so before you start. Now\r\nlet us go upstairs and have some supper. I am famished, and I suppose\r\nevery one else is too.\"\r\n\r\nArnold simply bowed in answer to the President; but one pair of eyes\r\nat least in the room caught the quick, faint flush that rose in his\r\ncheek as he was told in whose company he was to travel. As for\r\nhimself, if the journey had been to Siberia instead of Russia, he\r\nwould have felt nothing but pleasure at the prospect after that.\r\n\r\nThey left the Council-chamber by the passage and the ante-room, the\r\nsentry standing to attention as they passed him, each giving the word\r\nin turn, till the President came last and closed the doors behind\r\nhim. Then the sentry brought up the rear and extinguished the lights\r\nas he left the passage.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later there sat down to supper, in the solidly\r\ncomfortable dining-room of the upper house, a party of ladies and\r\ngentlemen who chatted through the meal as merrily and innocently as\r\nthough there were no such things as tyranny or suffering in the\r\nworld, and whom not the most acute observer would have taken for the\r\nmost dangerous and desperately earnest body of conspirators that ever\r\nplotted the destruction, not of an empire, but of a civilisation and\r\na social order that it had taken twenty centuries to build up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE DAUGHTER OF NATAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupper was over about eleven, and then the party adjourned to the\r\ndrawing-room, where for an hour or so Arnold sat and listened to such\r\nmusic and singing as he had never heard in his life before. The songs\r\nseemed to be in every language in Europe, and he did not understand\r\nanything like half of them, so far, at least, as the words were\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThey were, however, so far removed from the average drawing-room\r\nmedley of twaddle and rattle that the music interpreted the words\r\ninto its own universal language, and made them almost superfluous.\r\n\r\nFor the most part they were sad and passionate, and once or twice,\r\nespecially when Radna Michaelis was singing, Arnold saw tears well up\r\ninto the eyes of the women, and the brows of the men contract and\r\ntheir hands clench with sudden passion at the recollection of some\r\nterrible scene or story that was recalled by the song.\r\n\r\nAt last, close on midnight, the President rose from his seat and\r\nasked Natasha to sing the \"Hymn of Freedom.\" She acknowledged the\r\nrequest with an inclination of her head, and then as Radna sat down\r\nto the piano, and she took her place beside it, all the rest rose to\r\ntheir feet like worshippers in a church.\r\n\r\nThe prelude was rather longer than usual, and as Radna played it\r\nArnold heard running through it, as it were, echoes of all the\r\npatriotic songs of Europe from \"Scots Wha Hae\" and \"The Shan van\r\nVoght\" to the forbidden Polish National Hymn and the Swiss Republican\r\nsong, which is known in England as \"God Save the Queen.\" The prelude\r\nended with a few bars of the \"Marseillaise,\" and then Natasha began.\r\n\r\nIt was a marvellous performance. As the air changed from nation to\r\nnation the singer changed the language, and at the end of each verse\r\nthe others took up the strain in perfect harmony, till it sounded\r\nlike a chorus of the nations in miniature, each language coming in\r\nits turn until the last verse was reached.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence for a moment, and then the opening chords of\r\nthe \"Marseillaise\" rang out from the piano, slow and stately at\r\nfirst, and then quickening like the tread of an army going into\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Natasha's voice soared up, as it were, out of the music, and\r\na moment later the Song of the Revolution rolled forth in a flood of\r\ntriumphant melody, above which Natasha's pure contralto thrilled\r\nsweet and strong, till to Arnold's intoxicated senses it seemed like\r\nthe voice of some angel singing from the sky in the ears of men, and\r\nit was not until the hymn had been ended for some moments that he was\r\nrecalled to earth by the President saying to him--\r\n\r\n\"Some day, perhaps, you will be floating in the clouds, and you will\r\nhear that hymn rising from the throats of millions gathered together\r\nfrom the ends of the earth, and when you hear that you will know that\r\nour work is done, and that there is peace on earth at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" replied the engineer quietly, \"and, what is more, I\r\nbelieve that some day I shall hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe so too,\" suddenly interrupted Radna, turning round on her\r\nseat at the piano, \"but there will be many a battle-song sung to the\r\naccompaniment of battle-music before that happens. I wish\"--\r\n\r\n\"That all Russia were a haystack, and that you were beside it with a\r\nlighted torch,\" said Natasha, half in jest and half in earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, truly!\" replied Radna, turning round and dashing fiercely into\r\nthe \"Marseillaise\" again.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt of it. But, come, it is after midnight, and we have\r\nto get back to Cheyne Walk. The princess will think we have been\r\narrested or something equally dreadful. Ah, Mr. Colston, we have a\r\ncouple of seats to spare in the brougham. Will you and our Admiral of\r\nthe Air condescend to accept a lift as far as Chelsea?\"\r\n\r\n\"The condescension is in the offer, Natasha,\" replied Colston,\r\nflushing with pleasure and glancing towards Radna the while. Radna\r\nanswered with an almost imperceptible sign of consent, and Colston\r\nwent on: \"If it were in an utterly opposite direction\"--\r\n\r\n\"You would not be asked to come, sir. So don't try to pay compliments\r\nat the expense of common sense,\" laughed Natasha before he could\r\nfinish. \"If you do you shall sit beside me instead of Radna all the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general smile at this retort, for Colston's avowed\r\ndevotion to Radna and the terrible circumstances out of which it had\r\nsprung was one of the romances of the Circle.\r\n\r\nAs for Arnold, he could scarcely believe his ears when he heard that\r\nhe was to ride from Clapham Common to Chelsea sitting beside this\r\nradiantly beautiful girl, behind whose innocence and gaiety there lay\r\nthe shadow of her mysterious and terrible parentage.\r\n\r\nLovely and gentle as she seemed, he knew even now how awful a power\r\nshe held in the slender little hand whose nervous clasp he could\r\nstill feel upon his own, and this knowledge seemed to raise an\r\ninvisible yet impassable barrier between him and the possibility of\r\nlooking upon her as under other circumstances it would have been\r\nnatural for a man to look upon so fair a woman.\r\n\r\nNatasha's brougham was so far an improvement on those of the present\r\nday that it had two equally comfortable seats, and on these the four\r\nwere cosily seated a few minutes after the party broke up. To Arnold,\r\nand, doubtless, to Colston also, the miles flew past at an unheard-of\r\nspeed; but for all that, long before the carriage stopped at the\r\nhouse in Cheyne Walk, he had come to the conviction that, for good or\r\nevil, he was now bound to the Brotherhood by far stronger ties than\r\nany social or political opinions could have formed.\r\n\r\nAfter they had said good-night at the door, and received an\r\ninvitation to lunch for the next day to talk over the journey to\r\nRussia, he and Colston decided to walk to the Savoy, for it was a\r\nclear moonlit night, and each had a good deal to say to the other,\r\nwhich could be better and more safely said in the open air than in a\r\ncab. So they lit their cigars, buttoned up their coats, and started\r\noff eastward along the Embankment to Vauxhall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friend, tell me how you have enjoyed your evening, and what\r\nyou think of the company,\" said Colston, by way of opening the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"Until supper I had a very pleasant time of it. I enjoyed the\r\nbusiness part of the proceedings intensely, as any other mechanical\r\nenthusiast would have done, I suppose. But I frankly confess that\r\nafter that my mind is in a state of complete chaos, in the midst of\r\nwhich only one figure stands out at all distinctly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that figure is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Natasha. Tell me--who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know no more as to her true identity than you do, or else I would\r\nanswer you with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Do you mean to say\"--\r\n\r\n\"I mean to say just what I have said. Not only do I not know who she\r\nis, but I do not believe that more than two or three members of the\r\nCircle, at the outside, know any more than I do. Those are, probably,\r\nNicholas Roburoff, the President of the Executive, and his wife, and\r\nRadna Michaelis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if Radna knows, how comes it that you do not know? You must\r\nforgive me if I am presuming on a too short acquaintance; but it\r\ncertainly struck me to-night that you had very few secrets from each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no presumption about it, my dear fellow,\" replied Colston,\r\nwith a laugh. \"It is no secret that Radna and I are lovers, and that\r\nshe will be my wife when I have earned her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you have raised my curiosity again,\" interrupted Arnold, in an\r\ninquiring tone.\r\n\r\n\"And will very soon satisfy it. You saw that horrible picture in the\r\nCouncil-chamber? Yes. Well, I will tell you the whole story of that\r\nsome day when we have more time; but for the present it will be\r\nenough for me to tell you that I have sworn not to ask Radna to come\r\nwith me to the altar while a single person who was concerned in that\r\nnameless crime remains alive.\r\n\r\n\"There were five persons responsible for it to begin with--the\r\ngovernor of the prison, the prefect of police for the district, a\r\nspy, who informed against her, and the two soldiers who executed the\r\ninfernal sentence. It happened nearly three years ago, and there are\r\ntwo of them alive still--the governor and the prefect of police.\r\n\r\n\"Of course the Brotherhood would have removed them long ago had it\r\ndecided to do so; but I got the circumstances laid before Natas, by\r\nthe help of Natasha, and received permission to execute the sentences\r\nmyself. So far I have killed three with my own hand, and the other\r\ntwo have not much longer to live.\r\n\r\n\"The governor has been transferred to Siberia, and will probably be\r\nthe last that I shall reach. The prefect is now in command of the\r\nRussian secret police in London, and unless an accident happens he\r\nwill never leave England.\"\r\n\r\nColston spoke in a cold, passionless, merciless tone, just as a\r\nlawyer might speak of a criminal condemned to die by the ordinary\r\nprocess of the law, and as Arnold heard him he shuddered. But at the\r\nsame time the picture in the Council-chamber came up before his\r\nmental vision, and he was forced to confess that men who could so far\r\nforget their manhood as to lash a helpless woman up to a triangle and\r\nflog her till her flesh was cut to ribbons, were no longer men but\r\nwild beasts, whose very existence was a crime. So he merely said--\r\n\r\n\"They were justly slain. Now tell me more about Natasha.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is very little more that I can tell you, I'm afraid. All I\r\nknow is that the Brotherhood of the Terror is the conception and\r\ncreation of a single man, and that that man is Natas, the father of\r\nNatasha, as she is known to us. His orders come to us either directly\r\nin writing through Natasha, or indirectly through him you have heard\r\nspoken of as the Chief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then the Chief is not Natas?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we have all of us seen him. In fact, when he is in London he\r\nalways presides at the Circle meetings. You would hardly believe it,\r\nbut he is an English nobleman, and Secretary to the English Embassy\r\nat Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he is Lord Alanmere, and an old college friend of mine!\"\r\nexclaimed Arnold. \"I saw his name in the paper the night before last.\r\nIt was mentioned in the account of the murder\"--\r\n\r\n\"We don't call those murders, my friend,\" drily interrupted Colston;\r\n\"we call them what they really are--executions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon; I was using the phraseology of the newspaper.\r\nWhat was his crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But the fact that the Chief was there when he died is\r\nquite enough for me. Well, as I was saying, the Chief, as we call\r\nhim, is the visible and supreme head of the Brotherhood so far as we\r\nare concerned. We know that Natas exists, and that he and the Chief\r\nadmit no one save Natasha to their councils.\r\n\r\n\"They control the treasury absolutely, and apart from the\r\ncontributions of those of the members who can afford to make them,\r\nthey appear to provide the whole of the funds. Of course, Lord\r\nAlanmere, as you know, is enormously wealthy, and probably Natas is\r\nalso rich. At any rate, there is never any want of money where the\r\nwork of the Brotherhood is concerned.\r\n\r\n\"The estimates are given to Natasha when the Chief is not present,\r\nand at the next meeting she brings the money in English gold and\r\nnotes, or in foreign currency as may be required, and that is all we\r\nknow about the finances.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I ought to tell you that there is also a very considerable\r\nmystery about the Chief himself. When he presides at the Council\r\nmeetings he displays a perfectly marvellous knowledge of both the\r\nmembers and the working of the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem that nothing, however trifling, is hidden from him;\r\nand yet when any of us happen to meet him, as we often do, in\r\nSociety, he treats us all as the most perfect strangers, unless we\r\nhave been regularly introduced to him as ordinary acquaintances. Even\r\nthen he seems utterly ignorant of his connection with the\r\nBrotherhood.\r\n\r\n\"The first time I met him outside the Circle was at a ball at the\r\nRussian Embassy. I went and spoke to him, giving the sign of the\r\nInner Circle as I did so. To my utter amazement, he stared at me\r\nwithout a sign of recognition, and calmly informed me, in the usual\r\nway, that I had the advantage of him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I apologised, and he accepted the apology with perfect\r\ngood humour, but as an utter stranger would have done. A little later\r\nNatasha came in with the Princess Ornovski, whom you are going to\r\nRussia with, and who is there one of the most trusted agents of the\r\nPetersburg police. I told her what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"She looked at me for a moment rather curiously with those wonderful\r\neyes of hers; then she laughed softly, and said, 'Come, I will set\r\nthat at rest by introducing you; but mind, not a word about politics\r\nor those horrible secret societies, as you value my good opinion.'\r\n\r\n\"I understood from this that there was something behind which could\r\nnot be explained there, where every other one you danced with might\r\nbe a spy, and I was introduced to his Lordship, and we became very\r\ngood friends in the ordinary social way; but I failed to gather the\r\nslightest hint from his conversation that he even knew of the\r\nexistence of the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\"When we left I drove home with Natasha and the Princess to supper,\r\nand on the way Natasha told me that his Lordship found it necessary\r\nto lead two entirely distinct lives, and that he adhered so rigidly\r\nto this rule that he never broke it even with her. Since then I have\r\nbeen most careful to respect what, after all, is a very wise, if not\r\nan absolutely necessary, precaution on his part.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, now,\" said Arnold, speaking in a tone that betrayed not a\r\nlittle hesitation and embarrassment, \"if you can do so, answer me one\r\nmore question, and do so as shortly and directly as you can. Is\r\nNatasha in love with, or betrothed to, any member of the Brotherhood\r\nas far as you know?\"\r\n\r\nColston stopped and looked at him with a laugh in his eyes. Then he\r\nput his hand on his shoulder and said--\r\n\r\n\"As I thought, and feared! You have not escaped the common lot of all\r\nheart-whole men upon whom those terrible eyes of hers have looked.\r\nThe Angel of the Revolution, as we call her among ourselves, is\r\npeerless among the daughters of men. What more natural, then, that\r\nall the sons of men should fall speedy victims to her fatal charms?\r\nSo far as I know, every man who has ever seen her is more or less in\r\nlove with her--and mostly more!\r\n\r\n\"As for the rest, I am as much in the dark as you are, save for the\r\nfact that I know, on the authority of Radna, that she is not\r\nbetrothed to any one, and, so far as _she_ knows, still in the\r\nblissful state of maiden fancy-freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for that!\" said Arnold, with an audible sigh of relief.\r\nThen he went on in somewhat hurried confusion, \"But there, of course,\r\nyou think me a presumptuous ass, and so I am; wherefore\"--\r\n\r\n\"There is no need for you to talk nonsense, my dear fellow. There\r\nnever can be presumption in an honest man's love, no matter how\r\nexalted the object of it may be. Besides, are you not now the central\r\nhope of the Revolution, and is not yours the hand that shall hurl\r\ndestruction on its enemies?\r\n\r\n\"As for Natasha, peerless and all as she is, has not the poet of the\r\nages said of just such as her--\r\n\r\n  She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;\r\n  She is a woman: therefore to be won?\r\n\r\n\"And who, too, has a better chance of winning her than you will have\r\nwhen you are commanding the aërial fleet of the Brotherhood, and,\r\nlike a very Jove, hurling your destroying bolts from the clouds, and\r\ndeciding the hazard of war when the nations of Europe are locked in\r\nthe death-struggle? Why, you see such a prospect makes even me\r\npoetical.\r\n\r\n\"Seriously, though, you must not consider the distance between you\r\ntoo great. Remember that you are a very different person now to what\r\nyou were a couple of days ago. Without any offence, I may say that\r\nyou were then nameless, while now you have the chance of making a\r\nname that will go down to all time as that of the solver of the\r\ngreatest problem of this or any other age.\r\n\r\n\"Added to this, remember that Natasha, after all, is a woman, and,\r\nmore than that, a woman devoted heart and soul to a great cause, in\r\nwhich great deeds are soon to be done. Great deeds are still the\r\nshortest way to a woman's heart, and that is the way you must take if\r\nyou are to hope for success.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" simply replied Arnold, and the tone in which the two words\r\nwere said convinced Colston that he meant all that they implied to\r\nits fullest extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLEARNING THE PART.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven the next morning by the time Arnold and Colston\r\nhad finished breakfast. This was mostly due to the fact that Arnold\r\nhad passed an almost entirely sleepless night, and had only begun to\r\ndoze off towards morning. The events of the previous evening kept on\r\nrepeating themselves in various sequences time after time, until his\r\nbrain reeled in the whirl of emotions that they gave rise to.\r\n\r\nAlthough of a strongly mathematical and even mechanical turn of mind,\r\nthe young engineer was also an enthusiast, and therefore there was a\r\nstrong colouring of romance in his nature which lifted him far above\r\nthe level upon which his mere intellect was accustomed to work.\r\n\r\nWhere intellect alone was concerned--as, for instance, in the working\r\nout of a problem in engineering or mechanics--he was cool,\r\ncalculating, and absolutely unemotional. His highly-disciplined mind\r\nwas capable of banishing every other subject from consideration save\r\nthe one which claimed the attention of the hour, and of incorporating\r\nitself wholly with the work in hand until it was finished.\r\n\r\nThese qualities would have been quite sufficient to assure his\r\nsuccess in life on conventional lines. They would have made him rich,\r\nand perhaps famous, but they would never have made him a great\r\ninventor; for no one can do anything really great who is not a\r\ndreamer as well as a worker.\r\n\r\nIt was because he was a dreamer that he had sacrificed everything to\r\nthe working out of his ideal, and risked his life on the chance of\r\nsuccess, and it was for just the same reason that the tremendous\r\npurposes of the Brotherhood had been able to fire his imagination\r\nwith luridly brilliant dreams of a gigantic world-tragedy in which\r\nhe, armed with almost supernatural powers, should play the central\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThis of itself would have been enough to make all other\r\nconsiderations of trivial moment in his eyes, and to bind him\r\nirrevocably to the Brotherhood. He saw, it is true, that a frightful\r\namount of slaughter and suffering would be the price either of\r\nsuccess or failure in so terrific a struggle; but he also knew that\r\nthat struggle was inevitable in some form or other, and whether he\r\ntook a part in it or not.\r\n\r\nBut since the last sun had set a new element had come into his life,\r\nand was working in line with both his imagination and his ambition.\r\nSo far he had lived his life without any other human love than what\r\nwas bound up with his recollections of his home and his boyhood. As a\r\nman he had never loved any human being. Science had been his only\r\nmistress, and had claimed his undivided devotion, engrossing his mind\r\nand intellect completely, but leaving his heart free.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as it were in an instant, a new mistress had come forward\r\nout of the unknown. She had put her hand upon his heart, and, though\r\nno words of human speech had passed between them, save the merest\r\ncommonplaces, her soul had said to his, \"This is mine. I have called\r\nit into life, and for me it shall live until the end.\"\r\n\r\nHe had heard this as plainly as though it had been said to him with\r\nthe lips of flesh, and he had acquiesced in the imperious claim with\r\na glad submission which had yet to be tinged with the hope that it\r\nmight some day become a mastery.\r\n\r\nThus, as the silent, sleepless hours went by, did he review over and\r\nover again the position in which he found himself on the threshold of\r\nhis strange new life, until at last physical exhaustion brought sleep\r\nto his eyes if not to his brain, and he found himself flying over the\r\nhills and vales of dreamland in his air-ship, with the roar of battle\r\nand the smoke of ruined towns far beneath him, and Natasha at his\r\nside, sharing with him the dominion of the air that his genius had\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nAt length Colston came in to tell him that the breakfast was\r\nspoiling, and that it was high time to get up if they intended to be\r\nin time for their appointment at Chelsea. This brought him out of bed\r\nwith effective suddenness, and he made a hasty toilet for breakfast,\r\nleaving more important preparations until afterwards.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal their conversation naturally turned chiefly on the\r\nvisit that they were to pay, and Colston took the opportunity of\r\nexplaining one or two things that it was necessary for him to know\r\nwith regard to the new acquaintance that he was about to make at\r\nChelsea.\r\n\r\n\"So far as the outside world is concerned,\" said he, \"Natasha is the\r\nniece of the Princess Ornovski. She is the daughter of a sister of\r\nhers, who married an English gentleman, named Darrel, who was drowned\r\nwith his wife about twelve years ago, when the _Albania_ was wrecked\r\noff the coast of Portugal. The Princess had a sister, who was drowned\r\nwith her husband in the _Albania_, and she left a daughter about\r\nNatasha's then age, but who died of consumption shortly after in\r\nNice.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances, it was, of course, perfectly easy for the\r\nPrincess to adopt Natasha, and introduce her into Society as her\r\nniece as soon as she reached the age of coming out.\r\n\r\n\"This has been of immense service to the Brotherhood, as the Princess\r\nis, as I told you, one of the most implicitly trusted allies of the\r\nPetersburg police. She is received at the Russian Court, and is\r\ntherefore able to take Natasha into the best Russian Society, where\r\nher extraordinary beauty naturally enables her to break as many\r\nhearts as she likes, and to learn secrets which are of the greatest\r\nimportance to the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\"Her Society name is Fedora Darrel, and it will scarcely be necessary\r\nto tell you that outside our own Circle no such being as Natasha has\r\nany existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I perfectly understand,\" replied Arnold. \"The name shall never pass\r\nmy lips save in privacy, and indeed it is hardly likely that it will\r\never do so even then, for your habit of calling each other by your\r\nChristian names is too foreign to my British insularity.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a Russian habit, as you, of course, know, and added to that,\r\nwe are, so far as the Cause is concerned, all brothers and sisters\r\ntogether, and so it comes natural to us. Anyhow, you will have to use\r\nit with Natasha, for in the Circle she has no other name, and to call\r\nher Miss Darrel there would be to produce something like an\r\nearthquake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in that case, I daresay I shall be able to avoid the calamity,\r\nthough there will seem to be a presumption about it that will not\r\nmake me very comfortable at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much like addressing one's sweetheart, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThis brought the conversation to a sudden stop, for Arnold's only\r\nreply to it was a quick flush, and a lapse into silence that was a\r\ngood deal more eloquent than any verbal reply could have been.\r\nColston noticed it with a smile, and got up and lit a pipe.\r\n\r\nFor the first time for a good few years Arnold took considerable\r\npains with his toilet that morning. A new fit-out had just been\r\ndelivered by a tailor who had promised the things within twenty-four\r\nhours, and had kept his word. The consequences were that he was able\r\nto array himself in perfect morning costume, from his hat to his\r\nboots, and that was what it had not been his to do since he left\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nColston had recommended him in his easy friendly way to pay\r\nscrupulous attention to externals in the part that he would\r\nhenceforth have to play before the world. He fully saw the wisdom of\r\nthis advice, for he knew that, however well a part may be played, if\r\nit is not dressed to perfection, some sharp eyes will see that it is\r\na part and not a reality.\r\n\r\nThe playing of his part was to begin that day, and he recognised that\r\nat least one of the purposes of his visit to Natasha was the\r\ndetermining of what that part was to be. He thus looked forward with\r\nno little curiosity to the events of the afternoon, quite apart from\r\nthe supreme interest that centred in his hostess.\r\n\r\nThey started out nearly a couple of hours before they were due at\r\nCheyne Walk, as they had several orders to give with regard to\r\nArnold's outfit for the journey that was before him; and this done,\r\nthey reached the house about a quarter of an hour before lunch time.\r\n\r\nThey were received in the most delightful of sitting-rooms by a very\r\nhandsome, aristocratic-looking woman, who might have been anywhere\r\nbetween forty and fifty. She shook hands very cordially with Arnold,\r\nsaying as she did so--\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, Richard Arnold! The friends of the Cause are mine, and I\r\nhave heard much about you already from Natasha, so that I already\r\nseem to know you. I am very sorry that I was not able to be at the\r\nCircle last night to see what you had to show. Natasha tells me that\r\nit is quite a miracle of genius.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is too generous in her praise,\" replied Arnold, speaking as\r\nquietly as he could in spite of the delight that the words gave him.\r\n\"It is no miracle, but only the logical result of thought and work.\r\nStill, I hope that it will be found to realise its promise when the\r\ntime of trial comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that I have no doubt, from all that I hear,\" said the Princess.\r\n\"Before long I shall hope to see it for myself. Ah, here is Natasha.\r\nCome, I must introduce you afresh, for you do not know her yet as the\r\nworld knows her.\"\r\n\r\nArnold heard the door open behind him as the Princess spoke, and,\r\nturning round, saw Natasha coming towards him with her hand\r\noutstretched and a smile of welcome on her beautiful face. Before\r\ntheir hands met the Princess moved quietly between them and said,\r\nhalf in jest and half in earnest--\r\n\r\n\"Fedora, permit me to present to you Mr. Richard Arnold, who is to\r\naccompany us to Russia to inspect the war-balloon offered to our\r\nLittle Father the Tsar. Mr. Arnold, my niece, Fedora Darrel. There,\r\nnow you know each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Arnold,\" said Natasha,\r\nwith mock gravity as they shook hands. \"I have heard much already of\r\nyour skill in connection with aërial navigation, and I have no doubt\r\nbut that your advice will be of the greatest service to his Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is as it may be,\" answered Arnold, at once entering into the\r\nsomewhat grim humour of the situation. \"But if it is possible I\r\nshould like to hear something a little definite as to this mission\r\nwith which I have been, I fear, undeservingly honoured. I have been\r\nvery greatly interested in the problem of aërial navigation for some\r\nyears past, but I must confess that this is the first I have heard of\r\nthese particular war-balloons.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is for the purpose of enlightening you on that subject that this\r\nlittle party has been arranged,\" said the Princess, turning for the\r\nmoment away from Colston, with whom she was talking earnestly in a\r\nlow tone. \"Ha! There goes the lunch-bell. Mr. Colston, your arm.\r\nFedora, will you show Mr. Arnold the way?\"\r\n\r\nArnold opened the door for the Princess to go out, and then followed\r\nwith Natasha on his arm. As they went out, she said in a low tone to\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n\"I think, if you don't mind, you had better begin at once to call me\r\nMiss Darrel, so as to get into the way of it. A slip might be\r\nserious, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wishes are my laws, Miss Darrel,\" replied he, the name slipping\r\nas easily off his tongue as if he had known her by it for months. It\r\nmay have been only fancy on his part, he thought he felt just the\r\nlightest imaginable pressure on his arm as he spoke. At any rate, he\r\nwas vain enough or audacious enough to take the impression for a\r\nreality, and walked the rest of the way to the dining-room on air.\r\n\r\nThe meal was dainty and perfectly served, but there were no servants\r\npresent, for obvious reasons, and so they waited on themselves.\r\nColston sat opposite the Princess and carved the partridges, while\r\nArnold was _vis-à-vis_ to Natasha, a fact which had a perceptible\r\neffect upon his appetite.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the Princess, as soon as every one was helped, \"I will\r\nenlighten you, Mr. Arnold, as to your mission to Russia. One part of\r\nthe business, I presume, you are already familiar with?\"\r\n\r\nArnold bowed his assent, and she went on--\r\n\r\n\"Then the other is easily explained. Interested as you are in the\r\nquestion, I suppose there is no need to tell you that for several\r\nyears past the Tsar has had an offer open to all the world of a\r\nmillion sterling for a vessel that will float in the air, and be\r\ncapable of being directed in its course as a ship at sea can be\r\ndirected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am well aware of the fact. Pray proceed.\" As he said this\r\nArnold glanced across the table at Natasha, and a swift smile and a\r\nflash from her suddenly unveiled eyes told him that she, too, was\r\nthinking of how the world's history might have been altered had the\r\nTsar's million been paid for his invention. Then the Princess went\r\non--\r\n\r\n\"Well, through a friend at the Russian Embassy, I have learnt that a\r\nFrench engineer has, as he says, perfected a balloon constructed on a\r\nnew principle, which he claims will meet the conditions of the Tsar's\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n\"My friend also told me that his Majesty had decided to take an\r\nentirely disinterested opinion with regard to this invention, and\r\nasked me if I could recommend any English engineer who had made a\r\nstudy of aërial navigation, and who would be willing to go to Russia,\r\nsuperintend the trials of the war-balloon, and report as to their\r\nsuccess or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"This happened a few days ago only, and as I had happened to read an\r\narticle that you will remember you wrote about six months ago in the\r\n_Nineteenth_, or, as it is now called, the _Twentieth Century_, I\r\nthought of your name, and said I would try to find some one. Two days\r\nlater I got news from the Circle of your invention--never mind how;\r\nyou will learn that later on--and called at the Embassy to say I had\r\nfound some one whose judgment could be absolutely relied upon. Now,\r\nwasn't that kind of me, to give you such a testimonial as that to his\r\nOmnipotence the Tsar of All the Russias?\"\r\n\r\nOnce more Arnold bowed his acknowledgments--this time somewhat\r\nironically, and Natasha interrupted the narrative by saying with a\r\nspice of malice in her voice--\r\n\r\n\"No doubt the Little Father will duly recognise your kindness,\r\nPrincess, when he gets quite to the bottom of the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he will,\" replied the Princess, \"but that is a matter of the\r\nfuture--and of considerable doubt as well.\" Then, turning to Arnold\r\nagain, she continued--\r\n\r\n\"You will now, of course, see the immense advantage there appeared to\r\nbe in getting you to examine these war-balloons. They are evidently\r\nthe only possible rivals to your own invention in the field, and\r\ntherefore it is of the utmost importance that you should know their\r\nstrength or their weakness, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is all I have to say, so far. It has been decided that\r\nyou shall go, if you are willing, with us to Petersburg the day after\r\nto-morrow to see the balloon, and make your report. All your expenses\r\nwill be paid on the most liberal scale, for the Tsar is no niggard in\r\nspending either his own or other people's money, and you will have a\r\nhandsome fee into the bargain for your trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as the work is concerned, of course, I undertake it\r\nwillingly,\" said Arnold, as the Princess stopped speaking. \"But it\r\nhardly seems to me to be right that I should take even the Tsar's\r\nmoney under such circumstances. To tell you the truth, it looks to me\r\nrather uncomfortably like false pretences.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Natasha's eyes flashed approval across the table, but\r\nnevertheless she said--\r\n\r\n\"You seem to forget, my friend, that we are at war with the Tsar, and\r\nall's fair in--in love and war. Besides, if you have any scruples\r\nabout keeping the fee for your professional services--which, after\r\nall, you will render as honestly as though it were the merest matter\r\nof business--you can put it into the treasury, and so ease your\r\nconscience. Remember, too,\" she went on more seriously, \"how the\r\nenormous wealth of this same Tsar has swollen by the confiscation of\r\nfortunes whose possessors had committed no other crime than becoming\r\nobnoxious to the corrupt bureaucracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will take the fee if I fairly earn it, Miss Darrel,\" replied\r\nArnold, returning the glance as he spoke, \"and it shall be my first\r\ncontribution to the treasury of the Brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a sensible man,\" chimed in the Princess. \"After all, it\r\nis no worse than spoiling the Egyptians, and you have scriptural\r\nauthority for that. However, you can do as you like with his\r\nMajesty's money when you get it. The main fact is that you have the\r\nopportunity of going to earn it, and that Colonel Martinov is coming\r\nhere to tea this afternoon to bring our passports, specially\r\nauthorising us to travel without customs examination or any kind of\r\nquestioning to any part of the Tsar's dominions, and that, I can\r\nassure you, is a very exceptional honour indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did you say? Martinov? Is that the Colonel Martinov who is the\r\ndirector of the secret police here?\" asked Colston hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the Princess, \"the same. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Colston quietly, \"he received the sentence of death\r\nnearly a month ago, and to-morrow night he will be executed, unless\r\nthere is some accident. It was he who stood with the governor of\r\nBrovno in the prison-yard and watched Radna Michaelis flogged by the\r\nsoldiers. I received news this morning that the arrangements are\r\ncomplete, and that the sentence will be carried out to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is so,\" added Natasha, as Colston ceased speaking.\r\n\"Everything is settled. It is therefore well that he should do\r\nsomething useful before he meets his fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"How curious that it should just happen so!\" said the Princess\r\ncalmly, as she rose from the table and moved towards the door\r\nfollowed by Natasha.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ladies had left the room, Colston and Arnold lit their\r\ncigarettes and chatted while they smoked over their last glass of\r\nclaret. Arnold would have liked to have asked more about the coming\r\ntragedy, but something in Colston's manner restrained him; and so the\r\nconversation remained on the subject of the Russian journey until\r\nthey returned to the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF SORROWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March 1904, just six months after Arnold's journey to\r\nRussia, a special meeting of the Inner Circle of the Terrorists took\r\nplace in the Council-chamber, at the house on Clapham Common.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was only attended by twelve persons all told, and those\r\nmen and women whose names were unknown outside the circle of their\r\nown Society and the records of the Russian police, it was the most\r\nmomentous conference that had taken place in the history of the world\r\nsince the council of war that Abdurrhaman the Moslem had held with\r\nhis chieftains eleven hundred and seventy-two years before, and, by\r\ntaking their advice, spared the remnants of Christendom from the\r\nsword of Islam.\r\n\r\nThen the fate of the world hung in the balance of a council of war,\r\nand the supremacy of the Cross or the Crescent depended, humanly\r\nspeaking, upon the decision of a dozen warriors. Now the fate of the\r\ncivilisation that was made possible by that decision, lay at the\r\nmercy of a handful of outlaws and exiles who had laboriously brought\r\nto perfection the secret schemes of a single man.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Terrorists was finally complete. Under the whole\r\nfabric of Society lay the mines which a single spark would now\r\nexplode, and above this slumbering volcano the earth was trembling\r\nwith the tread of millions of armed men, divided into huge hostile\r\ncamps, and only waiting until Diplomacy had finished its work in the\r\ndark, and gave the long-awaited signal of inevitable and universal\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nTo-night that spark was to be shaken from the torch of Revolution,\r\nand to-morrow the first of the mines would explode. After that, if\r\nthe course to be determined on by the Terrorist Council failed to\r\narrive at the results which it was designed to reach, the armies of\r\nEurope would fight their way through the greatest war that the world\r\nhad ever seen, the Fates would once more decide in favour of the\r\nstrongest battalions, the fittest would triumph, and a new era of\r\nmilitary despotism would begin--perhaps neither much better nor much\r\nworse than the one it would succeed.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the plans of the Terrorists were successfully\r\nworked out to their logical conclusion, it would not be war only, but\r\nutter destruction that Society would have to face. And then with\r\ndissolution would come anarchy. The thrones of the world would be\r\noverthrown, the fabric of Society would be dissolved, commerce would\r\ncome to an end, the structure that it had taken twenty centuries of\r\nthe discipline of war and the patient toil of peace to build up,\r\nwould crumble into ruins in a few short months, and then--well, after\r\nthat no man could tell what would befall the remains of the human\r\nrace that had survived the deluge. The means of destruction were at\r\nhand, and they would be used without mercy, but for the rest no man\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\nWhen Nicholas Roburoff, the President of the Executive, rose in his\r\nplace at eight o'clock to explain the business in hand, every member\r\npresent saw at a glance, by the gravity of his demeanour, that the\r\ncommunication that he had to make was of no ordinary nature, but even\r\nthey were not prepared for the catastrophe that he announced in the\r\nfirst sentence that he uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" he said, in a voice that was rendered deeply impressive by\r\nthe emotion that he vainly tried to conceal, \"it is my mournful duty\r\nto tell you that she whom any one of us would willingly shed our\r\nblood to serve or save from the slightest evil, our beautiful and\r\nbeloved Angel of the Revolution, as we so fondly call her, Natasha,\r\nthe daughter of the Master, has, in the performance of her duty to\r\nthe Cause, fallen into the hands of Russia.\"\r\n\r\nSave for a low, murmuring groan that ran round the table, the news\r\nwas received in silence. It was too terrible, too hideous in the\r\nawful meaning that its few words conveyed, for any exclamations of\r\ngrief, or any outburst of anger, to express the emotions that it\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nNot one of those who heard it but had good reason to know what it\r\nmeant for a revolutionist to fall into the hands of Russia. For a man\r\nit meant the last extremity of human misery that flesh and blood\r\ncould bear, but for a young and beautiful woman it was a fate that no\r\nwords could describe--a doom that could only be thought of in silence\r\nand despair; and so the friends of Natasha were silent, though they\r\ndid not yet despair. Roburoff bowed his head in acknowledgment of the\r\ninarticulate but eloquent endorsement of his words, and went on--\r\n\r\n\"You already know the outcome of Richard Arnold's visit to Russia;\r\nhow he was present at the trial of the Tsar's war-balloon, and was\r\ncompelled to pronounce it such a complete success, that the Autocrat\r\nat once gave orders for the construction of a fleet of fifty\r\naërostats of the same pattern; and how, thanks to the warning\r\nconveyed by Anna Ornovski, he was able to prevent his special\r\npassport being stolen by a police agent, and so to foil the designs\r\nof the chief of the Third Section to stop him taking the secret of\r\nthe construction of the war-balloon out of Russia. You also know that\r\nhe brought back the Chief's authority to build an air-ship after the\r\nmodel which was exhibited to us here, and that since his return he\r\nhas been prosecuting that work on Drumcraig Island, one of the\r\npossessions of the Chief in the Outer Hebrides, which he placed at\r\nhis disposal for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"You know, also, that Natasha and Anna Ornovski went to Russia partly\r\nto discover the terms of the secret treaty that we believed to exist\r\nbetween France and Russia, and partly to warn, and, if possible,\r\nremove from Russian soil a large number of our most valuable allies,\r\nwhose names had been revealed to the Minister of the Interior,\r\nchiefly through the agency of the spy Martinov, who was executed in\r\nthis room six months ago.\r\n\r\n\"The first part of the task was achieved, not without difficulty, but\r\nwith complete success, and of that more anon. The second part was\r\nalmost finished when Natasha and Anna Ornovski were surprised in the\r\nhouse of Alexei Kassatkin, a member of the Moscow Nihilist Circle, in\r\nthe Bolshoi Dmitrietka. He had been betrayed by one of his own\r\nservants, and a police visit was the result.\r\n\r\n\"Added to this there is reason to believe that she had, quite apart\r\nfrom this, become acquainted with enough official secrets to make her\r\nremoval desirable in high quarters. I need not tell you that that is\r\nthe usual way in which the Tsar rewards those of his secret servants\r\nwho get to know too much.\r\n\r\n\"The fact of her being found in the house of a betrayed Nihilist was\r\ntaken as sufficient proof of sympathy or complicity, and she was\r\narrested. Natasha, as Fedora Darrel, claimed to be a British subject,\r\nand, as such, to be allowed to go free in virtue of the Tsar's safe\r\nconduct, which she exhibited. Instead of that she was taken before\r\nthe chief of the Moscow police, rudely interrogated, and then\r\nbrutally searched. Unhappily, in the bosom of her dress was found a\r\npiece of paper bearing some of the new police cypher. That was\r\nenough. That night they were thrown into prison, and three days later\r\ntaken to the convict depot under sentence of exile by administrative\r\nprocess to Sakhalin for life.\r\n\r\n\"You know what that means for a beautiful woman like Natasha. She\r\nwill not go to Sakhalin. They do not bury beauty like hers in such an\r\nabode of desolation as that. If she cannot be rescued, she will only\r\nhave two alternatives before her. She will become the slave and\r\nplaything of some brutal governor or commandant at one of the\r\nstations, or else she will kill herself. Of course, of these two she\r\nwould choose the latter--if she could and when she could. Should she\r\nbe driven to that last resort of despair, she shall be avenged as\r\nwoman never yet was avenged; but rescue must, if possible, come\r\nbefore revenge.\r\n\r\n\"The information that we have received from the Moscow agent tells us\r\nthat the convict train to which Natasha and Anna Ornovski are\r\nattached left the depot nearly a fortnight ago; they were to be taken\r\nby train in the usual way to Nizhni Novgorod, thence by barge on the\r\nVolga and Kama to Perm, and on by rail to Tiumen, the forwarding\r\nstation for the east. Until they reach Tiumen they will be safe from\r\nanything worse than what the Russians are pleased to call\r\n'discipline,' but once they disappear into the wilderness of Siberia\r\nthey will be lost to the world, and far from all law but the will of\r\ntheir official slave-drivers.\r\n\r\n\"It has, therefore, been decided that the rescue shall be attempted\r\nbefore the chain-gang leaves Tiumen, if it can be reached in time. As\r\nnearly as we can calculate, the march will begin on the morning of\r\nFriday the 9th, that is to say, in three nights and one day from now.\r\nHappily we possess the means of making the rescue, if it can be\r\naccomplished by human means. I have received a report from Richard\r\nArnold saying that the _Ariel_ is complete, and that she has made a\r\nperfectly satisfactory trial trip to the clouds. The _Ariel_ is the\r\nonly vehicle in existence that could possibly reach the frontier of\r\nSiberia in the given time, and it is fitting that her first duty\r\nshould be the rescue of the Angel of the Revolution from the clutches\r\nof the Tyrant of the North.\r\n\r\n\"Alexis Mazanoff, it is the will of the Master that you shall take\r\nthese instructions to Richard Arnold and accompany him on the voyage\r\nin order to show him what course to steer, and assist him in every\r\nway possible. You will find the Chief's yacht at Port Patrick ready\r\nto convey you to Drumcraig Island. When you have heard what is\r\nfurther necessary for you to hear, you will take the midnight express\r\nfrom Euston. Have you any preparations to make?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mazanoff, or Colston, to call him by a name more\r\nfamiliar to the reader. \"I can start in half an hour if necessary,\r\nand on such an errand you may, of course, depend on me not to lose\r\nmuch time. I presume there are full instructions here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, both for the rescue and for your conduct afterwards, whether\r\nyou are successful or unsuccessful,\" said the President. Then turning\r\nto the others he continued--\r\n\r\n\"You may now rest assured that all that can be done to rescue Natasha\r\nwill be done, and we must therefore turn to other matters. I said a\r\nshort time ago that the conditions of the secret treaty between\r\nFrance and Russia had been discovered by the two brave women who are\r\nnow suffering for their devotion to the cause of the Revolution. A\r\nfull copy of them is in the hands of the Chief, who arrives in London\r\nto-day, and will at once lay the documents before Mr. Balfour, the\r\nPremier.\r\n\r\n\"It is extremely hostile to England, and amounts, in fact, to a\r\ncompact on the part of France to declare war and seize the Suez\r\nCanal, as soon as the first shot is fired between Great Britain and\r\nRussia. In return for this, Russia is to invade Germany and Austria,\r\ndestroy the eastern frontier fortresses with her fleet of\r\nwar-balloons, and then cross over and do the same on the Rhine, while\r\nFrance at last throws herself upon her ancient foe.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, the French fleet is to concentrate in the Mediterranean\r\nas quietly and rapidly as possible, before war actually breaks out,\r\nso as to be able to hold the British and Italians in check, and shut\r\nthe Suez Canal, while Russia, who is pushing her troops forward to\r\nthe Hindu Kush, gets ready for a dash at the passes, and a rush upon\r\nCashmere, before Britain can get sufficient men out to India by the\r\nCape to give her very much trouble.\r\n\r\n\"As there also exists a secret compact between Britain and the Triple\r\nAlliance, binding all four powers to declare war the moment one is\r\nthreatened, the disclosure of this treaty must infallibly lead to war\r\nin a few weeks. In addition to this, measures have been taken to\r\ndetach Italy from the Triple Alliance at the last moment, if\r\npossible. Success in this respect is, however, somewhat uncertain.\r\n\r\n\"To make assurance doubly sure, the Chief informs me that he has\r\nordered Ivan Brassoff, who is in command of a large reconnoitring\r\nparty on the Afghan side of the Hindu Kush, to provoke reprisals from\r\na similar party of Indian troops who have been told off to watch\r\ntheir movements. Captain Brassoff is one of us, and can be depended\r\nupon to obey at all costs. He will do this in a fortnight from now,\r\nand therefore we may feel confident that Great Britain and Russia\r\nwill be at war within a month.\r\n\r\n\"With the first outbreak of war our work for the present ceases, so\r\nfar as active interference goes. We shall therefore withdraw from the\r\nscene of action until the arrival of the supreme moment when the\r\nnations of Europe shall be locked in the death-struggle, and the fate\r\nof the world will rest in our hands. The will of the Master now is\r\nthat all the members of the Brotherhood shall at once wind up their\r\nbusinesses, and turn all of their possessions that are not portable\r\nand useful into money.\r\n\r\n\"A large steamer has been purchased and manned with members of the\r\nOuter Circle who are sailors by profession. She is now being loaded\r\nat Liverpool with all the machinery and materials necessary for the\r\nconstruction of twelve air-ships like the _Ariel_. This steamer, when\r\nready for sea, will sail, ostensibly, for Rio de Janeiro with a cargo\r\nof machinery, but in reality for Drumcraig, where she will embark the\r\nworkmen who will be left there by the _Ariel_ with all the working\r\nplant on the island, and from there she will proceed to a lonely\r\nisland off the West Coast of Africa, between Cape Blanco and Cape\r\nVerde, where new works will be set up and the fleet of air-ships put\r\ntogether as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\n\"The position of this island is in the instructions which Alexis\r\nMazanoff takes to Drumcraig to-night, and the _Ariel_ will rendezvous\r\nthere when the work that is in hand for her is done. The members of\r\nthe Brotherhood will, of course, go in the steamer as passengers for\r\nRio, so that no suspicions may be aroused, and every one must be\r\nready to embark in ten days from now.\r\n\r\n\"That is all I have to say at present in the name of the Master. And\r\nnow, Alexis Mazanoff, it is time you set out. We shall remain here\r\nand discuss every detail fully so that nothing may be overlooked. You\r\nwill find that everything has been provided for in the instructions\r\nyou have, so go, and may the Master of Destiny be with you!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he held out his hand, which the young man grasped\r\nheartily, saying--\r\n\r\n\"Farewell! I will obey to the death, and if success can be earned we\r\nwill earn it. If not, you shall hear of the _Ariel's_ work in Russia\r\nbefore the week is out.\"\r\n\r\nHe then took leave of the other members of the Council, coming last\r\nto Radna. As their hands clasped she said--\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could come with you, but that is impossible. But bring\r\nNatasha back to us safe and sound, and there is nothing that you can\r\nask of me that I will not say 'yes' to. Go, and God speed your good\r\nwork. Farewell!\"\r\n\r\nFor all answer he took her in his arms before them all. Their lips\r\nmet in one long silent kiss, and a moment later he had gone to strike\r\nthe first blow in the coming world-war, and to bring the beginning of\r\nsorrows on the Tyrant of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE \"ARIEL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the sixth stroke of twelve that night the Scotch express drew out\r\nof Euston Station. At half-past nine the next morning, the _Lurline_,\r\nLord Alanmere's yacht, steamed out of Port Patrick Harbour, and at\r\none o'clock precisely she dropped her anchor in the little inlet that\r\nserved for a harbour at Drumcraig.\r\n\r\nColston had the quarter-boat lowered and pulled ashore without a\r\nmoment's delay, and as his foot touched the shore Arnold grasped his\r\nhand, and, after the first words of welcome, asked for the latest\r\nnews of Natasha.\r\n\r\nWithout immediately answering, Colston put his arm through his, drew\r\nhim away from the men who were standing about, and told him as\r\nbriefly and gently as he could the terrible news of the calamity that\r\nhad befallen the Brotherhood, and the errand upon which he had come.\r\n\r\nArnold received the blow as a brave man should--in silence. His now\r\nbronzed face turned pale, his brows contracted, and his teeth\r\nclenched till Colston could hear them gritting upon each other. Then\r\na great wave of agony swept over his soul as a picture too horrible\r\nfor contemplation rose before his eyes, and after that came calm, the\r\ncalm of rapid thought and desperate resolve.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the words that Natasha had used in a letter that she\r\nhad given him when she took leave of him in Russia. \"We shall trust\r\nto you to rescue us, and, if that is no longer possible, to avenge\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nYes, and now the time had come to justify that trust and prove his\r\nown devotion. It should be proved to the letter, and if there was\r\ncause for vengeance, the proof should be written in blood and flame\r\nover all the wide dominions of the Tsar. Grief might come after, when\r\nthere was time for it; but this was the hour of action, and a strange\r\nsavage joy seemed to come with the knowledge that the safety of the\r\nwoman he loved now depended mainly upon his own skill and daring.\r\n\r\nColston respected his silence, and waited until he spoke. When he did\r\nhe was astonished at the difference that those few minutes had made\r\nin the young engineer. The dreamer and the enthusiast had become the\r\nman of action, prompt, stern, and decided. Colston had never before\r\nheard from his lips the voice in which he at length said to him--\r\n\r\n\"Where is this place? How far is it as the crow flies from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"At a rough guess I should say about two thousand two hundred miles,\r\nalmost due east, and rather less than two hundred miles on the other\r\nside of the Ourals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! That will be twenty hours' flight for us, or less if this\r\nsouth-west wind holds good.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Colston. \"Twenty hours, did you say? You must\r\nsurely be making some mistake. Don't you mean forty hours? Think of\r\nthe enormous distance. Why, even then we should have to travel over\r\nsixty miles an hour through the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, I don't make mistakes where figures are concerned.\r\nThe paradox of aërial navigation is 'the greater the speed the less\r\nthe resistance.'\r\n\r\n\"In virtue of that paradox I am able to tell you that the speed of\r\nthe _Ariel_ in moderate weather is a hundred and twenty miles an\r\nhour, and a hundred and twenty into two thousand two hundred goes\r\neighteen times and one-third. This is Wednesday, and we have to be on\r\nthe Asiatic frontier at daybreak on Friday. We shall start at dusk\r\nto-night, and you shall see to-morrow's sun set over the Ourals.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means from the eastern side of the range!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. There will be no harm in being a few hours too soon. In\r\ncase we may have a long cruise, I must have additional stores, and\r\npower-cylinders put on board. Come, you have not seen the _Ariel_\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\"I have made several improvements on the model, as I expected to do\r\nwhen I came to the actual building of the ship, and, what is more\r\nimportant than that, I have immensely increased the motive power and\r\neconomised space and weight at the same time. In fact, I don't\r\ndespair now of two hundred miles an hour before very long. Come!\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer and the enthusiast had now come to the fore again, and\r\nthe man and the lover had receded, put back, as it were, until the\r\ntime for love, or perchance for sorrow, had come.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm through Colston's, and led him up a hill-path and\r\nthrough a little gorge which opened into a deep valley, completely\r\nscreened on all sides by heather-clad hills. Sprinkled about the\r\nbottom of this valley were a few wooden dwelling-houses and\r\nworkshops, and in the centre was a huge shed, or rather an enclosure\r\nnow, for its roof had been taken off.\r\n\r\nIn this lay, like a ship in a graving-dock, a long, narrow,\r\ngrey-painted vessel almost exactly like a sea-going ship, save for\r\nthe fact that she had no funnel, and that her three masts, instead of\r\nyards, each carried a horizontal fan-wheel, while from each of her\r\nsides projected, level with the deck, a plane twice the width of the\r\ndeck and nearly as long as the vessel herself.\r\n\r\nThey entered the enclosure and walked round the hull. This was\r\nseventy feet long and twelve wide amidships, and save for size it was\r\nthe exact counterpart of the model already described.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had taken Colston round the hull, and roughly explained\r\nits principal features, reserving more detailed description and the\r\ninspection of the interior for the voyage, he gave the necessary\r\norders for preparing for a lengthy journey, and the two went on board\r\nthe _Lurline_ to dinner, which Colston had deferred in order to eat\r\nit in Arnold's company.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they carefully discussed the situation in order that\r\nevery possible accident might be foreseen, argued the pros and cons\r\nof the venture in all their bearings, and even went so far as to plan\r\nthe vengeance they would take should, by any chance, the rescue fail\r\nor come too late.\r\n\r\nThe instructions, signed by Natas himself, were very precise on\r\ncertain essential points, and in their broad outlines, but, like all\r\nwisely planned instructions to such men as these, they left ample\r\nmargin for individual initiative in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nSome of the stores of the _Lurline_ had to be transferred to the\r\n_Ariel_, and these were taken ashore after dinner, and at the same\r\ntime Colston made his first inspection of the interior of the\r\nair-ship, under the guidance of her creator. What struck him most at\r\nfirst sight was the apparent inadequacy of the machinery to the\r\nattainment of the tremendous speed at which Arnold had promised they\r\nshould travel.\r\n\r\nThere were four somewhat insignificant-looking engines in all. Of\r\nthese, one drove the stern propeller, one the side propellers, and\r\ntwo the fan-wheels on the masts. He learnt as soon as the voyage\r\nbegan, that, by a very simple switch arrangement, the power of the\r\nwhole four engines could be concentrated on the propellers; for, once\r\nin the air, the lifting wheels were dispensed with and lowered on\r\ndeck, and the ship was entirely sustained by the pressure of the air\r\nunder her planes.\r\n\r\nThere was not an ounce of superfluous wood or metal about the\r\nbeautifully constructed craft, but for all that she was complete in\r\nevery detail, and the accommodation she had for crew and passengers\r\nwas perfectly comfortable, and in some respects cosy in the extreme.\r\nForward there was a spacious cabin with berths for six men, and aft\r\nthere were separate cabins for six people, and a central saloon for\r\ncommon use.\r\n\r\nOn deck there were three structures, a sort of little conning tower\r\nforward, a wheel-house aft, and a deck saloon amidships. All these\r\nwere, of course, so constructed as to offer the least possible\r\nresistance to the wind, or rather the current created by the vessel\r\nherself when flying through the air at a speed greater than that of\r\nthe hurricane itself.\r\n\r\nAll were closely windowed with toughened glass, for it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that, but for such a protection, every one who\r\nappeared above the level of the deck would be almost instantly\r\nsuffocated, if not whirled overboard, by the rush of air when the\r\nship was going at full speed. Her armament consisted of four long,\r\nslender cannon, two pointing over the bows, and two over the stem.\r\n\r\nThe crew that Arnold had chosen for the voyage consisted, curiously\r\nenough, of men belonging to the four nationalities which would be\r\nprincipally concerned in the Titanic struggle which a few weeks would\r\nnow see raging over Europe. Their names were Andrew Smith,\r\nEnglishman, and coxswain; Ivan Petrovitch, Russian; Franz Meyer,\r\nGerman; and Jean Guichard, Frenchman. Diverse as they were, there\r\nnever were four better workers, or four better friends.\r\n\r\nThey had no country but the world, and no law save those which\r\ngoverned their Brotherhood. They conversed in assorted but perfectly\r\nintelligible English, for the very simple reason that Mr. Andrew\r\nSmith consistently refused to attempt even the rudiments of any other\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nWhile the stores were being put on board, Arnold made a careful\r\nexamination of every part of the machinery, and then of the whole\r\nvessel, in order to assure himself that everything was in perfect\r\norder. This done, he gave his final instructions to those of the\r\nlittle community who were left behind to await the arrival of the\r\nsteamer, and as the sun sank behind the western ridges of the island,\r\nhe went on board the _Ariel_ with Colston, took his place at the\r\nwheel, and ordered the fan-wheels to be set in motion.\r\n\r\nColston was standing by the open door of the wheel-house as Arnold\r\ncommunicated his order to the engine-room by pressing an electric\r\nbutton, one of four in a little square of mahogany in front of the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThere was no vibration or grinding, as would have been the case in\r\nstarting a steamer, but only a soft whirring, humming sound, that\r\nrose several degrees in pitch as the engines gained speed, and the\r\nfan-wheels revolved faster and faster until they sang in the air, and\r\nthe _Ariel_ rose without a jar or a tremor from the ground, slowly at\r\nfirst, and then more and more swiftly, until Colston saw the ground\r\nsinking rapidly beneath him, and the island growing smaller and\r\nsmaller, until it looked like a little patch on the dark grey water\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nAway to the north and west he could see the innumerable islands of\r\nthe Hebrides, while to the east the huge mountainous mass of the\r\nmainland of Scotland loomed dark upon the horizon.\r\n\r\nWhen the barometer marked eight hundred feet above the sea-level, the\r\n_Ariel_ passed through a stratum of light clouds, and on the upper\r\nside of this the sun was still shining, shooting his almost level\r\nrays across it as though over some illimitable sea of white fleecy\r\nbillows, whose crests were tipped with rosy, golden light.\r\n\r\nAbove the surface of this fairy sea rose north-eastward the black\r\nmass of Ben More on the Island of Mull, and to the southward, the\r\nlesser peaks of Jura and Islay.\r\n\r\nWhile he was still wrapped in admiration of the strange beauty of\r\nthis, to him, marvellous scene, the _Ariel_ had risen to a thousand\r\nfeet, still almost in a vertical line from the island. Arnold now\r\npressed another button, and the stern propeller began to revolve\r\nswiftly and noiselessly, and Colston saw the waves of the cloud-sea\r\nbegin to slip behind, although so smooth was the working of the\r\nmachinery, and the motion of the air-ship, that, but for this, he\r\ncould hardly have guessed that he was in motion.\r\n\r\nArnold now turned a few spokes of the wheel, and headed the _Ariel_\r\ndue east by the compass. Then he touched a third button. The side\r\npropellers began to turn swiftly on their axes, and, at the same time\r\nthe speed of the fan-wheels slackened, and gradually stopped.\r\n\r\nColston now began to feel the air rushing by him in a stream so rapid\r\nand strong, that he had to take hold of the side of the wheel-house\r\ndoorway to steady himself.\r\n\r\n\"I think you had better come inside and shut the door,\" said Arnold.\r\n\"We are getting up speed now, and in a few minutes you won't be able\r\nto hold yourself there. You'll be able to see just as well inside.\"\r\n\r\nColston did as he was bidden, and as soon as he was safely inside\r\nArnold pulled a lever beside the wheel, and slightly inclined the\r\nplanes from forward aft. At the same time the fan-wheels began to\r\nslide down the masts until they rested upon the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you shall see her fly,\" said Arnold, taking a speaking-tube\r\nfrom the wall and whistling thrice into it.\r\n\r\nColston felt a slight tremor in the deck beneath his feet, and then a\r\nlifting movement. He staggered a little, and said to Arnold--\r\n\r\n\"What's that? Are we going higher still?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the engineer. \"She is feeling the air-planes now under\r\nthe increased speed. I am going up to fifteen hundred feet, so that\r\nwe shall only have the highest peaks to steer clear of in crossing\r\nScotland. Now, use your eyes, and you will see something worth\r\nlooking at.\"\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the wheel-house was constructed almost entirely of\r\nglass, and so Colston could see just as well as if he had been on\r\ndeck outside. He did use his eyes. In fact, for some time to come,\r\nall his other senses seemed to be merged in that of sight, for the\r\nscene was one of such rare and marvellous beauty, and the sensations\r\nthat it called up were of so completely novel a nature, that, for the\r\ntime being, he felt as though he had been suddenly transported into\r\nfairyland.\r\n\r\nThe cloud-sea now lay about seven hundred feet beneath them. The sun\r\nhad sunk quite below the horizon, even at that elevation; but his\r\nabsence was more than made up for by the nearly full moon, which had\r\nrisen to the southward, as though to greet the conqueror of the air,\r\nand was spreading a flood of silvery radiance over the snowy plain\r\nbeneath, through the great gaps in which they could see the darker\r\nsheen of the moving sea-waves.\r\n\r\nTheir course lay almost exactly along the fifty-sixth parallel of\r\nlatitude, and took them across Argyle, Dumbarton, and Stirlingshire\r\nto the head of the Firth of Forth. As they approached the mainland,\r\nColston saw one or two peaks rise up out of the clouds, and soon they\r\nwere sweeping along in the midst of a score or so of these. To the\r\nleft Ben Lomond towered into the clear sky above his attendant peaks,\r\nand to the right the lower summits of the Campsie Fells soon rose a\r\nfew miles ahead.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which these mountain-tops rose up on either side,\r\nand were left behind, proved to Colston that the _Ariel_ must be\r\ntravelling at a tremendous speed, and yet, but for a very slight\r\nquivering of the deck, there was no motion perceptible, so smoothly\r\ndid the air-ship glide through the elastic medium in which she\r\nfloated.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he with the unearthly beauty of the new world into\r\nwhich he had risen, that for nearly two hours he stood without\r\nspeaking a word. Arnold, wrapped in his own thoughts, maintained a\r\nlike silence, and so they sped on amidst a stillness that was only\r\nbroken by the soft whirring of the propellers, and the singing of the\r\nwind past the masts and stays.\r\n\r\nAt length a faint sound like the dashing of breakers on a rocky coast\r\nroused Colston from his reverie, and he turned to Arnold and said--\r\n\r\n\"What is that? Not the sea, surely!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, those are the waves of the Firth of Forth breaking on the\r\nshores of Fife.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Do you mean to tell me that we have crossed Scotland already?\r\nWhy, we have not been an hour on the way yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, we have,\" replied the engineer. \"We have been nearly two.\r\nYou have been so busy looking about you that you have not noticed how\r\nthe time has passed. We have travelled a little over two hundred and\r\nforty miles. We are over the German Ocean now, and as there will be\r\nno more hills until we reach the Ourals we can go down a little.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he moved the lever beside him about an inch, and\r\ninstantly the clouds seemed to rise up toward them as the _Ariel_\r\nswept downwards in her flight. A hundred feet above them Arnold\r\ntouched the lever again, and the air-ship at once resumed her\r\nhorizontal course.\r\n\r\nThen he put her head a little more to the northward, and called down\r\nthe speaking tube for Andrew Smith to come and relieve him. A minute\r\nlater Smith's head appeared at the top of the companion-ladder which\r\nled from the saloon to the wheel-house, and Arnold gave him the wheel\r\nand the course, saying at the same time to Colston--\r\n\r\n\"Now, come down and have something to eat, and then we will have a\r\nsmoke and a chat and go to bed. There is nothing more to be seen\r\nuntil the morning, and then I will show you Petersburg as it looks\r\nfrom the clouds.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you told me you would show me the Ourals themselves, I should\r\nbelieve you after what I have seen,\" replied Colston, as together\r\nthey descended the companion-way from the wheel-house to the saloon.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I'm afraid that would be too much even for the _Ariel_ to\r\naccomplish in the time,\" said Arnold. \"Still, I think I can guarantee\r\nthat you shall cross Europe in such time as no man ever crossed it\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFIRST BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter supper the two friends ascended to the deck saloon for a smoke,\r\nand to continue their discussion of the tremendous events in which\r\nthey were so soon to be taking part. They found the _Ariel_ flying\r\nthrough a cloudless sky over the German Ocean, whose white-crested\r\nbillows, silvered by the moonlight, were travelling towards the\r\nnorth-east under the influence of the south-west breeze from which\r\nthe engineer had promised himself assistance when they started.\r\n\r\n\"We seem to be going at a most frightful speed,\" said Colston,\r\nlooking down at the water. \"There's a strong south-west breeze\r\nblowing, and yet those white horses seem to be travelling quite the\r\nother way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Arnold, looking down. \"This wind will be travelling\r\nabout twenty miles an hour, and that means that we are making nearly\r\na hundred and fifty. The German Ocean here is five hundred miles\r\nacross, and we shall cross it at this rate in about three hours and a\r\nhalf, and if the wind holds over the land we shall sight Petersburg\r\nsoon after sunrise.\r\n\r\n\"The sun will rise to-morrow morning a few minutes after five by\r\nGreenwich time, which is about two hours behind Petersburg time.\r\nAltogether we shall make, I expect, from two to two and a half hours'\r\ngain on time.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men talked until a few minutes after ten, and then went to\r\nbed. Colston, who had been travelling all the previous night, began\r\nto feel drowsy in spite of the excitement of the novel voyage, and\r\nalmost as soon as he lay down in his berth dropped off into a sound,\r\ndreamless sleep, and knew nothing more until Arnold knocked at his\r\ndoor and said--\r\n\r\n\"If you want to see the sun rise, you had better get up. Coffee will\r\nbe ready in a quarter of an hour.\"\r\n\r\nColston pulled back the slide which covered the large oblong pane of\r\ntoughened glass which was let into the side of his cabin and looked\r\nout. There was just light enough in the grey dawn to enable him to\r\nsee that the _Ariel_ was passing over a sea dotted in the distance\r\nwith an immense number of islands.\r\n\r\n\"The Baltic,\" he said to himself as he jumped out of bed. \"This is\r\ntravelling with a vengeance! Why, we must have travelled a good deal\r\nover a thousand miles during the night. I suppose those islands will\r\nbe off the coast of Finland. If so, we are not far from Petersburg,\r\nas the _Ariel_ seems to count distance.\"\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent spectacle that Colston had ever seen in his\r\nlife, or, for the matter of that, ever dreamed of, was the one that\r\nhe saw from the conning-tower of the _Ariel_ while the sun was rising\r\nover the vast plain of mingled land and water which stretched away to\r\nthe eastward until it melted away into the haze of early morning.\r\n\r\nThe sky was perfectly clear and cloudless, save for a few light\r\nclouds that hung about the eastern horizon, and were blazing gold and\r\nred in the light of the newly-risen sun. The air-ship was flying at\r\nan elevation of about two thousand feet, which appeared to be her\r\nnormal height for ordinary travelling. There was land upon both sides\r\nof them, but in front opened a wide bay, the northern shores of which\r\nwere still fringed with ice and snow.\r\n\r\n\"That is the Gulf of Finland,\" said Arnold. \"The winter must have\r\nbeen very late this year, and that probably means that we shall find\r\nthe eastern side of the Ourals still snow-bound.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" replied Colston. \"They will have a much better\r\nchance of escape if there is good travelling for a sleigh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Arnold, his brows contracting as he spoke. \"Do you\r\nknow, if it were not for the Master's explicit orders, I should be\r\ninclined to smash up the station at Ekaterinburg a few hours\r\nbeforehand, and then demand the release of the whole convict train,\r\nunder penalty of laying the town in ruins.\"\r\n\r\nColston shook his head, saying--\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my friend, we must have a little more diplomacy than that.\r\nYour thirst for the life of the enemy will, no doubt, be fully\r\ngratified later on. Besides, you must remember that you would\r\nprobably blow some hundreds of perfectly innocent people to pieces,\r\nand very possibly a good many friends of the Cause among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Arnold; \"I didn't think of that; but I'll tell you\r\nwhat we can do, if you like, without transgressing our instructions\r\nor hurting any one except the soldiers of the Tsar, who, of course,\r\nare paid to slaughter and be slaughtered, and so don't count.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Colston.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be passing over Kronstadt in a little over an hour, and we\r\nmight take the opportunity of showing his Majesty the Tsar what the\r\n_Ariel_ can do with the strongest fortress in Europe. How would you\r\nlike to fire the first shot in the war of the Revolution?\"\r\n\r\nColston was silent for a few moments, and then he looked up and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"There is not the slightest reason why we should not take a shot at\r\nKronstadt, if only to give the Russians a foretaste of favours to\r\ncome. Still, I won't fire the first shot on any account, simply\r\nbecause that honour belongs to you. I'll fire the second with\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" replied Arnold. \"We'll have two shots apiece, one each\r\nas we approach the fortress, and one each as we leave it. Now come\r\nand take a preparatory lesson in the new gunnery.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down into the chief saloon, and there Arnold showed Colston\r\na model of the new weapon with which the _Ariel_ was armed, and\r\nthoroughly explained the working of it. After this they went to the\r\nwheel-house, where Arnold inclined the planes at a sharper angle, and\r\nsent the _Ariel_ flying up into the sky, until the barometer showed\r\nan elevation of three thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThen he signalled to the engine-room, the fan-wheels rose from the\r\ndeck, as if by their own volition, and, as soon as they reached their\r\nplaces, began to spin round faster and faster, until Colston could\r\nagain hear the high-pitched singing sound that he had heard as the\r\n_Ariel_ rose from Drumcraig Island.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the speed of the vessel rapidly decreased; the side\r\npropellers ceased working, and the stern-screw revolved more and more\r\nslowly, until the speed came down to about thirty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nBy this time the great fortress of Kronstadt could be distinctly seen\r\nlying upon its island, like some huge watch-dog crouched at the\r\nentrance to his master's house, guarding the way to St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Arnold, \"we can go outside without any fear of being\r\nblown off into space.\"\r\n\r\nThey went out and walked forward to the bow. Arrived there they found\r\ntwo of the men, each with a curious-looking shell in his arms. The\r\nprojectiles were about two feet long and six inches in diameter, and\r\nwere, as Arnold told Colston, constructed of _papier-maché_. There\r\nwere three blades projecting from the outside, and running spirally\r\nfrom the point to the butt. These fitted into grooves in the inside\r\nof the cannon, which were really huge air-guns twenty feet long,\r\nincluding the air-chamber at the breech.\r\n\r\nThe projectiles were placed in position, the breeches of the guns\r\nclosed, and a minute later the air-chambers were filled with air at a\r\npressure of two hundred atmospheres, pumped from the forward engines\r\nthrough pipes leading up to the guns for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Arnold, \"we're ready! Meanwhile you two can go and load\r\nthe two after guns.\"\r\n\r\nThe men saluted and retired, and Arnold continued--\r\n\r\n\"Just take a look down with your glasses and see if they see us. I\r\nexpect they do by this time.\"\r\n\r\nColston put his field-glass to his eyes, and looked down at the\r\nfortress, which was now only six or seven miles ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"at any rate I can see a lot of little figures\r\nrunning about on the roof of one of the ramparts, which I suppose are\r\nsoldiers. What's the range of your gun? I should say the fortress is\r\nabout six miles off now.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can hit it from here, if you like,\" replied Arnold, \"and if we\r\nwere a thousand feet higher I could send a shell into Petersburg.\r\nSee! there is the City of Palaces. Away yonder in the distance you\r\ncan just see the sun shining on the houses. We could see it quite\r\nplainly if it wasn't for the haze that seems to be lying over the\r\nNeva.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, Arnold trained the gun according to a scale on\r\na curved steel rod which passed through a screw socket in the breech\r\nof the piece.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said. \"Watch!\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button on the top of the breech. There was a sharp but\r\nnot very loud sound as the compressed air was released; something\r\nrushed out of the muzzle of the gun, and a few seconds later, Colston\r\ncould see the missile boring its way through the air, and pursuing a\r\nslanting but perfectly direct path for the centre of the fortress.\r\n\r\nA second later it struck. He could see a bright greenish flash as it\r\nsmote the steel roof of the central fort. Then the fort seemed to\r\ncrumble up and dissolve into fragments, and a few moments later a\r\ndull report floated up into the sky mingled, as he thought, with\r\nscreams of human agony.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stared in silence through the glasses, then he turned\r\nto Arnold and said in a voice that trembled with violent emotion--\r\n\r\n\"Good God, that is awful! The whole of the centre citadel is gone as\r\nthough it had been swept off the face of the earth. I can hardly see\r\neven the ruins of it. Surely that's murder rather than war!\"\r\n\r\n\"No more murder than the use of torpedoes in naval warfare, as far as\r\nI can see,\" replied Arnold coolly. \"Remember, too,\" he continued in a\r\nsterner tone, \"that fortress belongs to the power that flogged Radna\r\nand has captured Natasha. Come, let's see what execution you can do.\"\r\n\r\nHe crossed the deck and set the other gun by its scale, saying as he\r\ndid so--\r\n\r\n\"Put your finger on the button and press when I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nColston did as he was bid, and as his finger touched the little knob\r\nhis hand was as firm as though he had been making a shot at\r\nbilliards.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed the button down hard. There was the same sharp sound, and\r\na second messenger of destruction sped on its way towards the doomed\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Good God, that is awful.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 82._]\r\n\r\nThey saw it strike, and then came the flash, and after that a huge\r\ncloud of dust mingled with flying objects that might have been blocks\r\nof masonry, guns, or human bodies, rose into the air, and then fell\r\nback again to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"There goes one of the angles of the fortification into the sea,\"\r\nsaid Arnold, as he saw the effects of the shot. \"Kronstadt won't be\r\nmuch good when the war breaks out, it strikes me. I suppose they'll\r\nbe replying soon with a few rifle shots. We'd better quicken up a\r\nbit.\"\r\n\r\nHe went aft to the wheel-house, followed by Colston, and signalled\r\nfor the three propellers to work at their utmost speed. The order was\r\ninstantly obeyed; the fan-wheels ceased revolving, and under the\r\nimpetus of her propellers the _Ariel_ leapt forwards and upwards like\r\nan eagle on its upward swoop, rose five hundred feet in the air, and\r\nthen swept over Kronstadt at a speed of more than a hundred miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nAs they passed over they saw a series of flashes rise from one of the\r\nuntouched portions of the fortress, but no bullets came anywhere near\r\nthem. In fact, they must have passed through the air two or three\r\nmiles astern of the flying _Ariel_. No soldier who ever carried a\r\nrifle could have sent a bullet within a thousand yards of an object\r\nseventy feet long travelling over a hundred miles an hour at a height\r\nof nearly four thousand feet, and so the Russians wasted their\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had passed over the fortress, Arnold signalled for\r\nthe propellers to stop, and the fan-wheels to revolve again at half\r\nspeed. The air-ship stopped within three miles, and remained\r\nsuspended in air over the opening mouth of the Neva. Then the two\r\nafter guns were trained upon the fortress, and Colston and Arnold\r\nfired them together.\r\n\r\nThe two shells struck at the same moment, one in each of two angles\r\nof the ramparts. Their impact was followed by a tremendous explosion,\r\nfar greater than could be accounted for by the shells themselves.\r\n\r\n\"There goes one, if not two, of his powder magazines. Look! half the\r\nfortress is a wreck. I wonder which fired the lucky shot.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who a year before had been an inoffensive student of\r\nmechanics and an enthusiast dreaming of an unsolved problem, spoke of\r\nthe frightful destruction of life and the havoc that he had caused by\r\njust pressing a button with his finger, as coolly and quietly as a\r\nveteran officer of artillery might have spoken of shelling a fort.\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons for this almost miraculous change. One was to\r\nbe found in the bitter hatred of Russian tyranny which he had imbibed\r\nduring the last six months, and the other was the fact that the woman\r\nfor whom he would have himself died a thousand deaths if necessary,\r\nwas a captive in Russian chains, being led at that moment to slavery\r\nand degradation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had seen the effects of the last two shots, Arnold\r\nsaid with a grim, half-smile on his lips--\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be better if we don't show ourselves too plainly to\r\nPetersburg. It will take some time for the news of the destruction of\r\nKronstadt to reach the city, and, of course, there will be the\r\nwildest rumours as to the agency by which it was done, so we may as\r\nwell leave them to argue the matter out among themselves.\"\r\n\r\nHe signalled again to the engine-room, and with the united aid of her\r\nplanes and fan-wheels the _Ariel_ mounted up and up into the sky,\r\ndriven only by the stern-propeller and with the force of the other\r\nengines concentrated on the lifting wheels, until a height of five\r\nthousand feet was reached.\r\n\r\nAt that height she would have looked, if she could have been seen at\r\nall, nothing more than a little grey spot against the blue of the\r\nsky, and as they heard afterwards she passed over St. Petersburg\r\nwithout being noticed.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Petersburg to Tiumen, as the crow flies, the distance is\r\n1150 English miles, and nine hours after she had passed over the\r\nCapital of the North, the _Ariel_ had winged her way over the Ourals\r\nand the still snow-clad forests of the eastern slopes, past the\r\ntear-washed Pillar of Farewells, and had come to a rest after her\r\nvoyage of two thousand two hundred miles, including the delay at\r\nKronstadt, in twenty hours almost to the minute, as her captain had\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nIN THE MASTER'S NAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Ariel_, in order to avoid being seen from the town, had made a\r\nwide circuit to the northward at a considerable elevation, and as\r\nsoon as a suitable spot had been sought out by means of the\r\nfield-glasses, she dropped suddenly and swiftly from the clouds into\r\nthe depths of the dense forest through which the Tobolsk road runs\r\nfrom Tiumen to the banks of the Tobol.\r\n\r\nFrom Tiumen to the Tobol is about twenty-five miles by road. The\r\nrailway, which was then finished as far as Tomsk, ran to Tobolsk by a\r\nmore northerly and direct route than the road, but convicts were\r\nstill marched on foot along the great post road after the gangs had\r\nbeen divided at Tiumen according to their destinations.\r\n\r\nThe spot which had been selected for the resting-place of the _Ariel_\r\nwas a little glade formed by the bend of a frozen stream about five\r\nmiles east of the town, and at a safe distance from the road.\r\n\r\nPainted a light whitish-grey all over, she would have been invisible\r\neven from a short distance as she lay amid the snow-laden trees, and\r\nArnold gave strict orders that all the window-slides were to be kept\r\nclosed, and no light shown on any account.\r\n\r\nEvery precaution possible was taken to obviate a discovery which\r\nshould seriously endanger the success of the rescue, but,\r\nnevertheless, the fan-wheels were kept aloft, and everything was in\r\nreadiness to rise into the air at a moment's notice should any\r\nemergency require them to do so.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after three o'clock on the Thursday afternoon when\r\nthe _Ariel_ settled down in her resting-place, and half an hour later\r\nColston and Ivan Petrovitch appeared on deck completely disguised,\r\nthe former as a Russian fur trader, and the latter as his servant.\r\n\r\nAll the arrangements for the rescue had been once more gone over in\r\nevery detail, and just before he swung himself over the side Colston\r\nshook hands for the last time with Arnold, saying as he did so--\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye again, old fellow! Ivan shall come back and bring you\r\nthe news, if necessary; but if he doesn't come, don't be uneasy, but\r\npossess your soul in patience till you hear the whistle from the road\r\nin the morning. I expect the train will get in sometime during the\r\nnight, and in that case we shall have everything ready to make the\r\nattempt soon after daybreak, if not before.\r\n\r\n\"If we can get as far as this without being pursued we shall come\r\nright on board. If not we must trust to our horses and our pistols to\r\nkeep the Cossacks at a distance till you can help us. In any case,\r\nrest assured that once clear of Tiumen, we shall never be taken\r\nalive. Those are the Master's orders, and I will shoot Natasha myself\r\nbefore she goes back to captivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do so,\" replied Arnold. His lips quivered as he spoke, but\r\nthere was no tremor in the hand with which he gripped Colston's in\r\nfarewell. \"She will prefer death to slavery, and I shall prefer it\r\nfor her. But if you have to do it you will at least have the\r\nconsolation of knowing that within twelve hours of your death the\r\nTsar shall be lying buried beneath the ruins of the Peterhof Palace.\r\nI will have his life for hers if only I live to take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell her,\" said Colston simply, \"and if die she must, she\r\nwill die content.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he descended the little rope-ladder, followed by Ivan, and\r\nin a few moments the two were lost in the deep shadow of the trees,\r\nwhile Arnold went down into the saloon to await with what patience he\r\nmight the moment that would decide the fate of the daughter of Natas\r\nand the man who had gone, as he would so gladly have done, to risk\r\nhis life to restore her to liberty.\r\n\r\nRather more than half an hour's tramp through the forest brought\r\nColston and Ivan out on the road at a point a little less than five\r\nmiles from Tiumen.\r\n\r\nColston was provided with passports and permits to travel for himself\r\nand Ivan. These, of course, were forged on genuine forms which the\r\nTerrorists had no difficulty in obtaining through their agents in\r\nhigh places, who were as implicitly trusted as the Princess Ornovski\r\nhad been but a few months before.\r\n\r\nSo skilfully were they executed, however, that it would have been a\r\nvery keen official eye that had discovered anything wrong with them.\r\nThey described him as \"Stepan Bakuinin, fur merchant of Nizhni\r\nNovgorod, travelling in pursuit of his business, with his servant,\r\nPeter Petrovitch, also of Nizhni Novgorod.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of going straight into the town by the main road they made a\r\nconsiderable detour and entered it by a lane that led them through a\r\ncollection of miserable huts occupied by the poorest class of\r\nSiberian mujiks, half peasants, half townsfolk, who cultivate their\r\npatches of ground during the brief spring and summer, and struggle\r\nthrough the long dreary winter as best they can on their scanty\r\nsavings and what work they can get to do from the Government or their\r\nricher neighbours.\r\n\r\nColston had never been in Tiumen before, but Ivan had, for ten years\r\nbefore he had voluntarily accompanied his father, who had been\r\ncondemned to five years' forced labour on the new railway works from\r\nTiumen to Tobolsk, for giving a political fugitive shelter in his\r\nhouse. He had died of hard labour and hard usage, and that was one\r\nreason why Ivan was a member of the Outer Circle of the Terrorists.\r\n\r\nHe led his master through the squalid suburb to the business part of\r\nthe town, which had considerably developed since the through line to\r\nTobolsk and Tomsk had been constructed, and at length they stopped\r\nbefore a comfortable-looking house in the street that ends at the\r\nrailway station.\r\n\r\nThey knocked, gave their names, and were at once admitted. The\r\nservant who opened the door to them led them to a room in which they\r\nfound a man of about fifty in the uniform of a sub-commissioner of\r\npolice. As Colston held out his hand to him he said--\r\n\r\n\"In the Master's name!\"\r\n\r\nThe official took his hand, and, bending over it, replied in a low\r\ntone--\r\n\r\n\"I am his servant. What is his will?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Anna Ornovski and Fedora Darrel, the English girl who was taken\r\nwith her, be released as soon as may be,\" replied Colston. \"Is the\r\ntrain from Ekaterinburg in yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. The snow is still deep between here and the mountains. The\r\nwinter has been very severe and long. We have almost starved in\r\nTiumen in spite of the railway. There has been a telegram from\r\nEkaterinburg to say that the train descended the mountain safely, and\r\none from Kannishlov to say that we expect it soon after ten\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! That is sooner than we expected in London. We thought it would\r\nnot reach here till to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"In London! What do you mean? You cannot have come from London, for\r\nthere has been no train for two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless I have come from London. I left England yesterday\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday evening! But, with all submission, that is impossible. If\r\nthere were a railway the whole distance it could not be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the Master there is nothing impossible. Look! I received that the\r\nevening I left London.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Colston held out an envelope. The Russian examined it\r\nclosely. It bore the Ludgate Hill post-mark, which was dated \"March\r\n7.\"\r\n\r\nColston's host bent over it with almost superstitious reverence, and\r\nhanded it back, saying humbly--\r\n\r\n\"Forgive my doubts, Nobleness! It is a miracle! I ask no more. The\r\nTsar himself could not have done it. The Master is all powerful, and\r\nI am proud to be his servant, even to the death.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the twentieth century had dawned, the Siberian Russians were\r\nstill inclined to look even upon the railway as a miracle. This man,\r\nalthough he occupied a post of very considerable responsibility and\r\nauthority under the Russian Government, was only a member of the\r\nOuter Circle of the Terrorists, as most of the officials were, and\r\ntherefore he knew nothing of the existence of the _Ariel_, and\r\nColston purposely mystified him with the apparent miracle of his\r\npresence in Tiumen after so short an absence from London, in order to\r\ncommand his more complete obedience in the momentous work that was on\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHe allowed the official a few moments to absorb the full wonder of\r\nthe seeming marvel, and then he replied--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are all his servants _to the death_. At least I know of none\r\nwho have even thought of treason to him and lived to put their\r\nthoughts into action. But tell me, are all the arrangements complete\r\nas far as you can make them? Much depends upon how you carry them\r\nout, you know, to say nothing of the two thousand roubles that I\r\nshall hand to you as soon as the two ladies are delivered into my\r\ncharge.\"\r\n\r\n\"All is arranged, Nobleness,\" replied the official, bowing\r\ninvoluntarily at the mention of the money. \"Such of the prisoners,\r\nthat is to say the politicals, who can afford to pay for the\r\nprivilege, may, by the new regulations, be lodged in the houses of\r\napproved persons during their sojourn in Tiumen, if it be only for a\r\nnight, and so escape the common prison.\r\n\r\n\"We knew at the police bureau of the arrest of the Princess Ornovski\r\nsome days ago, and I have obtained permission from the chief of\r\npolice to lodge her Highness and her companion in misfortune--if they\r\nare prepared to pay what I shall ask. It has come to be looked upon\r\nas a sort of perquisite of diligent officials, and as I have been\r\nvery diligent here I had no difficulty in getting the\r\npermission--which I shall have to pay for in due course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so! Nothing for nothing in Russian official circles. Very good.\r\nNow listen. If this escape is successfully accomplished you will be\r\ndegraded and probably punished into the bargain for letting the\r\nprisoners slip through your fingers. But that must not happen if it\r\ncan be prevented.\r\n\r\n\"Now this has been foreseen, as everything is with the Master; and\r\nhis orders are that you shall take this passport--which you will find\r\nin perfect order, save for the fact that the date has been slightly\r\naltered--from me as soon as I have got the ladies safely in the\r\ntroika out on the Tobolsk road, put off the livery of the Tsar,\r\ndisguise yourself as effectually as may be, and take the first train\r\nback to Perm and Nizhni Novgorod as Stepan Bakuinin, fur merchant.\r\n\r\n\"The servant you can leave behind on any excuse. From Novgorod you\r\ncan travel _viâ_ Moscow to Königsberg, and, if you will take my\r\nadvice, you will get out of Russia as soon as the Fates will let\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be done, Nobleness. But how will the disappearance of\r\nDmitri Soudeikin, sub-commissioner of police, be accounted for?\"\r\n\r\n\"That also has been provided for. Before you go you will pin this\r\nwith a dagger to your sitting-room table.\"\r\n\r\nThe official took the little piece of paper which Colston held out to\r\nhim as he spoke. It read thus--\r\n\r\n    Dmitri Soudeikin, sub-commissioner of police at Tiumen, has been\r\n    removed for over-zeal in the service of the Tsar.\r\n\r\n      NATAS.\r\n\r\nSoudeikin bowed almost to the ground as the dreaded name of the\r\nMaster of the Terror met his eyes, and then he said, as he handed the\r\npaper back--\r\n\r\n\"It is so! The Master sees all, and cares for the least of his\r\nservants. My life shall be forfeited if the ladies are not released\r\nas I have said.\"\r\n\r\n\"It probably will be,\" returned Colston drily. \"None of us expect to\r\nget out of this business alive if it does not succeed. Now that is\r\nall I have to say for the present. It is for you to bring the ladies\r\nhere as your prisoners, to see us out of the town before daybreak,\r\nand to have the troika in readiness for us on the Tobolsk road. Then\r\nsee to yourself and I will be responsible for the rest.\"\r\n\r\nAs it still wanted more than two hours to the expected arrival of the\r\ntrain, Soudeikin had the samovar, or tea-urn, brought in, and Colston\r\nand Ivan made a hearty meal after their five-mile walk through the\r\nsnow. Then they and their host lit their pipes, and smoked and\r\nchatted until a distant whistle warned Soudeikin that the train was\r\nat last approaching the station, and that it was time for him to be\r\non duty to receive his convict-lodgers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFOR LIFE OR DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo time had ever seemed so long to Colston as did the hour and a half\r\nwhich passed after the departure of Soudeikin until his return. He\r\nwould have given anything to have accompanied him to the station, but\r\nit would have been so very unwise to have incurred the risk of being\r\nquestioned, and perhaps obliged to show the passport that Soudeikin\r\nwas to use, that he controlled his impatience as best he could, and\r\nlet events take their course.\r\n\r\nAt length, when he had looked at his watch for the fiftieth time, and\r\nfound that it indicated nearly half-past eleven, there was a heavy\r\nknock at the door. As it opened, Colston heard a rattle of arms and a\r\nclinking of chains. Then there was a sound of gruff guttural voices\r\nin the entrance-hall, and the next moment the door of the room was\r\nthrown open, and Soudeikin walked in, followed by a young man in the\r\nuniform of a lieutenant of the line, and after them came two\r\nsoldiers, to one of whom was handcuffed the Princess Ornovski, and to\r\nthe other Natasha.\r\n\r\nShocked as he was at the pitiable change that had taken place in the\r\nappearance of the two prisoners since he had last seen them in\r\nfreedom, Colston was far too well trained in the school of conspiracy\r\nto let the slightest sign of surprise or recognition escape him.\r\n\r\nHe and Ivan rose as the party entered, greeted Soudeikin and saluted\r\nthe officer, hardly glancing at the two pale, haggard women in their\r\nrough grey shapeless gowns and hoods as they stood beside the men to\r\nwhom they were chained.\r\n\r\nAs the officer returned Colston's salute he turned to Soudeikin and\r\nsaid civilly enough--\r\n\r\n\"I did not know you had another guest. I hope we shall not overcrowd\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" replied the commissioner, waving his hand toward\r\nColston as he spoke. \"This is only my nephew, Ernst Vronski, who is\r\nstaying with me for a day or two on his way through to Nizhni\r\nNovgorod with his furs, and that is his servant, Ivan Arkavitch. You\r\nneed not be uneasy. I have plenty of rooms, as I live almost alone,\r\nand I have set apart one for the prisoners which I think will satisfy\r\nyou in every way. Would it please you to come and see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we will go now and get them put in safety for the night, if you\r\nwill lead the way.\"\r\n\r\nAs the party left the room Colston caught one swift glance from\r\nNatasha which told him that she understood his presence in the house\r\nfully, and he felt that, despite her miserable position, he had an\r\nally in her who could be depended upon.\r\n\r\nThe officer carefully examined the room which had been provided for\r\nthe two prisoners, tried the heavy shutters with which the windows\r\nwere closed, and took from Soudeikin the keys of the padlocks to the\r\nbars which ran across them. He then directed the prisoners to be\r\nreleased from their handcuffs and locked them in the room, stationing\r\none of the soldiers at the door and sending the other to patrol the\r\nback of the house from which the two windows of the room looked out.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two hours the sentries were to change places, and in\r\ntwo hours more they were to be relieved by a detachment from the\r\nnight patrol. This arrangement had been foreseen by Soudeikin, and it\r\nhad been settled that the rescue was to be attempted as soon as the\r\nguard had been changed.\r\n\r\nThis would give the prisoners time to get a brief but much needed\r\nrest after their long and miserable journey from Perm, penned up like\r\nsheep in iron-barred cattle trucks, and it would leave the drowsiest\r\npart of the night, from four o'clock to sunrise, for the hazardous\r\nwork in hand.\r\n\r\n\"That is a pretty girl you have there, captain,\" said Colston, as the\r\nofficer returned to the sitting-room. \"Is she for the mines or\r\nSakhalin?\"\r\n\r\n\"For Sakhalin by sentence, but as a matter of fact for neither, as\r\nfar as I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that the Little Father will pardon her or give her a\r\nlighter sentence, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer grinned meaningly as he replied--\r\n\r\n\"_Nu vot!_ That is hardly likely. What I mean is that Captain\r\nKharkov, who is in command of the convict train from here, has had\r\ninstructions to convey her as comfortably as possible, and with no\r\nmore fatigue than is necessary, to Tchit, in the Trans-Baikal, and\r\nthat he is also charged with a letter from the Governor of Perm to\r\nthe Governor of Tchit.\r\n\r\n\"You know these gentlemen like to do each other a good turn when they\r\ncan, and so, putting two and two together, I should say that his\r\nExcellency of Perm has concluded that our pretty prisoner will serve\r\nto beguile the dulness of that Godforsaken hole in which his\r\nExcellency of Tchit is probably dying of _ennui_. She will be more\r\ncomfortable there than at Sakhalin, and it is a lucky thing for her\r\nthat she has found favour in his Excellency's eyes.\"\r\n\r\nColston could have shot the fellow where he sat leering across the\r\ntable; but though his blood was at boiling point, he controlled\r\nhimself sufficiently to make a reply after the same fashion, and soon\r\nafter took his leave and retired for the night.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock the guard was changed. The new officer, after taking\r\nthe keys, unlocked the door of the room in which Natasha and the\r\nPrincess were confined, and roused them up to satisfy himself that\r\nthey were still in safe keeping. It was a brutal formality, but\r\nperfectly characteristic of Siberian officialism.\r\n\r\nThe man who had been on guard so far joined the patrol and returned\r\nto the barracks, while the new officer made himself comfortable with\r\na bottle of brandy, with which Soudeikin had obligingly provided him,\r\nin the sitting-room. It was a bitterly cold night, and he drank a\r\ncouple of glasses of it in quick succession. Ten minutes after he had\r\nswallowed the second he rolled backwards on the couch on which he was\r\nsitting and went fast asleep. A few moments later he had ceased to\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nThen the door opened softly and Soudeikin and Colston slipped into\r\nthe room. The former shook him by the shoulder. His eyes remained\r\nhalf closed, his head lolled loosely from side to side, and his arms\r\nhung heavily downwards.\r\n\r\n\"He's gone,\" whispered Soudeikin; and, without another word, they set\r\nto work to strip the uniform off the lifeless body. Then Colston\r\ndressed himself in it and gave his own clothes to Soudeikin.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the change was effected, Colston took the keys and went to\r\nthe door at which the sentry was keeping guard. The man was already\r\nhalf asleep, and blinked at him with drowsy eyes as he challenged\r\nhim. For all answer the Terrorist levelled his pistol at his head and\r\nfired. There was a sharp crack that could hardly have been heard on\r\nthe other side of the wall, and the man tumbled down with a bullet\r\nthrough his brain.\r\n\r\nColston stepped over the corpse, unlocked the door, and found Natasha\r\nand the Princess already dressed in male attire as two peasant boys,\r\nwith sheepskin coats and shapkas, and wide trousers tucked into their\r\nhalf boots. These disguises had been provided beforehand by\r\nSoudeikin, and hidden in the bed in which they were to sleep.\r\n\r\nColston grasped their hands in silence, and the three left the room.\r\nIn the passage they found Ivan and Soudeikin, the former dressed in\r\nthe uniform of the soldier who had been on guard outside the house,\r\nand whose half-stripped corpse was now lying buried in the snow.\r\n\r\n\"Ready?\" whispered Soudeikin.\r\n\r\n\"Have you finished in there?\" asked Colston, jerking his thumb\r\ntowards the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nSoudeikin nodded in reply, and the five left the house by the back\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nIt was then after half-past four. Fortunately it was a dark cloudy\r\nmorning, and the streets of the town were utterly deserted. By ones\r\nand twos they stole through the by-streets and lanes without meeting\r\na soul, until Soudeikin at length stopped at a house on the eastern\r\nedge of the town about a mile from the Tobolsk road.\r\n\r\nHe tapped at one of the windows. The door was softly opened by an\r\ninvisible hand, and they entered and passed through a dark passage\r\nand out into a stable-yard behind the house. Under a shed they found\r\na troika, or three-horse sleigh, with the horses ready harnessed, in\r\ncharge of a man dressed as a mujik.\r\n\r\nThey got in without a word, all but Soudeikin, who went to the\r\nhorses' heads, while the other man went and opened the gates of the\r\nyard. The bells had been removed from the harness, and the horses'\r\nfeet made no sound as Soudeikin led them out through the gate. Ivan\r\ntook the reins, and Colston held out his hand from the sleigh. There\r\nwas a roll of notes in it, and as he gave it to Soudeikin he\r\nwhispered--\r\n\r\n\"Farewell! If we succeed, the Master shall know how well you have\r\ndone your part.\"\r\n\r\nSoudeikin took the money with a salute and a whispered farewell, and\r\nIvan trotted his horses quietly down the lane and swung round into\r\nthe road at the end of it.\r\n\r\nSo far all had gone well, but the supreme moment of peril had yet to\r\ncome. A mile away down the road was the guard-house on the Tobolsk\r\nroad leading out of the town, and this had to be passed before there\r\nwas even a chance of safety.\r\n\r\nAs there was no hope of getting the sleigh past unobserved, Colston\r\nhad determined to trust to a rush when the moment came. He had given\r\nNatasha and the Princess a magazine pistol apiece, and held a brace\r\nin his own hands; so among them they had a hundred shots.\r\n\r\nIvan kept his horses at an easy trot till they were within a hundred\r\nyards of the guard-house. Then, at a sign from Colston, he suddenly\r\nlashed them into a gallop, and the sleigh dashed forward at a\r\nheadlong speed, swept round the curve past the guard-house, hurling\r\none of the sentries on guard to the earth, and away out on to the\r\nTobolsk road.\r\n\r\nThe next instant the notes of a bugle rang out clear and shrill just\r\nas another sounded from the other end of the town. Colston at once\r\nguessed what had happened. The inspector of the patrols, in going his\r\nrounds, had called at Soudeikin's house to see if all was right, and\r\nhad discovered the tragedy that had taken place. He looked back and\r\nsaw a body of Cossacks galloping down the main street towards the\r\nguard-house, waving their lanterns and brandishing their spears above\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\n\"Whip up, Ivan, they will be on us in a couple of minutes!\" he cried\r\nand Ivan swung his long whip out over his horses' ears, and shouted\r\nat them till they put their heads down and tore over the smooth snow\r\nin gallant style.\r\n\r\nBy the time the race for life or death really began they had a good\r\nmile start, and as they had only four more to go Ivan did not spare\r\nhis cattle, but plied whip and voice with a will till the trees\r\nwhirled past in a continuous dark line, and the sleigh seemed to fly\r\nover the snow almost without touching it.\r\n\r\nStill the Cossacks gained on them yard by yard, till at the end of\r\nthe fourth mile they were less than three hundred yards behind. Then\r\nColston leant over the back of the sleigh, and taking the best aim he\r\ncould, sent half a dozen shots among them. He saw a couple of the\r\nflying figures reel and fall, but their comrades galloped heedlessly\r\nover them, yelling wildly at the tops of their voices, and every\r\nmoment lessening the distance between themselves and the sleigh.\r\n\r\nColston fired a dozen more shots into them, and had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing three or four of them roll into the snow. At the same time\r\nhe put a whistle to his lips, and blew a long shrill call that\r\nsounded high and clear above the hoarse yells of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nTheir pursuers were now within a hundred yards of them, and Natasha,\r\nspeaking for the first time since the race had begun, said--\r\n\r\n\"I think I can do something now.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she leaned out of the sleigh sideways, and began firing\r\nrapidly at the Cossacks. Shot after shot told either upon man or\r\nbeast, for the daughter of Natas was one of the best shots in the\r\nBrotherhood; but before she had fired a dozen times a bright gleam of\r\nwhite light shot downwards over the trees, apparently from the\r\nclouds, full in the faces of their pursuers.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily they reined up like one man, and their yells of fury\r\nchanged in an instant into a general cry of terror. The Cossacks are\r\nas brave as any soldiers on earth, and they can fight any mortal foe\r\nlike the fiends that they are, but here was an enemy they had never\r\nseen before, a strange, white, ghostly-looking thing that floated in\r\nthe clouds and glared at them with a great blazing, blinding eye,\r\ndazzling them and making their horses plunge and rear like things\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nThey were not long left in doubt as to the intentions of their new\r\nenemy. Something came rushing through the air and struck the ground\r\nalmost at the feet of their first rank. Then there was a flash of\r\ngreen light, a stunning report, and men and horses were rent into\r\nfragments and hurled into the air like dead leaves before a\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\nOnly three or four who had turned tail at once were left alive; and\r\nthese, without daring to look behind them, drove their spurs into\r\ntheir horses' flanks and galloped back to Tiumen, half mad with\r\nterror, to tell how a demon had come down from the skies, annihilated\r\ntheir comrades, and carried the fugitives away into the clouds upon\r\nits back.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the town it was a scene of the utmost panic.\r\nSoldiers were galloping and running hither and thither, bugles were\r\nsounding, and the whole population were turning out into the\r\nsnow-covered streets. On every lip there were only two\r\nwords--\"Natas!\" \"The Terrorists!\"\r\n\r\nThe death sentence on Soudeikin, the sub-commissioner of police, had\r\nbeen found pinned with a dagger to the table in the room in which lay\r\nthe body of the lieutenant, with the bloody *T* on his forehead.\r\nSoudeikin had vanished utterly, leaving only his uniform behind him;\r\nso had the two prisoners for whom he had made himself responsible,\r\nand at the door of their room lay the corpse of the sentry with a\r\nbullet-hole clean through his head from front to back, while in the\r\nsnow under one of the windows of the room lay the body of the other\r\nsentry, stabbed through the heart.\r\n\r\nFrom the very midst of one of the strongholds of Russian tyranny in\r\nSiberia, two important prisoners and a police official had been\r\nspirited away as though by magic, and now upon the top of all the\r\nwonder and dismay came the fugitive Cossacks with their wild tale\r\nabout the air-demon that had swooped down and destroyed their troop\r\nat a single blow. To crown all, half an hour later three horses, mad\r\nwith fear, came galloping up the Tobolsk road, dragging behind them\r\nan empty sleigh, to one of the seats of which was pinned a scrap of\r\npaper on which was written--\r\n\r\n\"The daughter of Natas sends greeting to the Governor of Tiumen, and\r\nthanks him for his hospitality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Tuesday, the 9th of March 1904, the _Times_\r\npublished the following telegram at the head of its Foreign\r\nIntelligence:--\r\n\r\n      ASTOUNDING OCCURRENCE IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n      _Destruction of Kronstadt by an unknown Air-Ship._\r\n      (_From our own Correspondent._)\r\n\r\n      St. Petersburg, _March 8th_, 4 P.M.\r\n\r\n    Between six and seven this morning, the fortress of Kronstadt was\r\n    partially destroyed by an unknown air-ship, which was first\r\n    sighted approaching from the westward at a tremendous speed.\r\n\r\n    Four shots in all were fired upon the fortress, and produced the\r\n    most appalling destruction. There was no smoke or flame visible\r\n    from the guns of the air-ship, and the explosives with which the\r\n    missiles were charged must have been far more powerful than\r\n    anything hitherto used in warfare, as in the focus of the\r\n    explosion masses of iron and steel and solid masonry were\r\n    instantly reduced to powder.\r\n\r\n    Two shots were fired as the strange vessel approached, and two as\r\n    she left the fortress. The two latter exploded over one of the\r\n    powder magazines, dissolved the steel roof to dust, and ignited\r\n    the whole contents of the magazine, blowing that portion of the\r\n    fortification bodily into the sea. At least half the garrison has\r\n    disappeared, most of the unfortunate men having been practically\r\n    annihilated by the terrific force of the explosions.\r\n\r\n    The air-ship was not of the navigable balloon type, and is\r\n    described by the survivors as looking more like a flying\r\n    torpedo-boat than anything else. She flew no flag, and there is\r\n    no clue to her origin.\r\n\r\n    After destroying the fortress, she ascended several thousand\r\n    feet, and continued her eastward course at such a prodigious\r\n    speed, that in less than five minutes she was lost to sight.\r\n\r\n    The excitement in St. Petersburg almost reaches the point of\r\n    panic. All efforts to keep the news of the disaster secret have\r\n    completely failed, and I have therefore received permission to\r\n    send this telegram, which has been revised by the Censorship, and\r\n    may therefore be accepted as authentic.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of the appearance of this telegram, which appeared\r\nonly in the _Times_, the Russian Censorship having refused to allow\r\nany more to be despatched, the astounding news was flying over the\r\nwires to every corner of the world.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ had a lengthy and very able article on the subject,\r\nwhich, although by no means alarmist in tone, told the world, in\r\ngrave and weighty sentences, that there could now be no doubt but\r\nthat the problem of aërial navigation had been completely solved, and\r\nthat therefore mankind stood confronted by a power that was\r\npractically irresistible, and which changed the whole aspect of\r\nwarfare by land and sea.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this power, the fortresses, armies, and fleets of the\r\nworld were useless and helpless. The destruction of Kronstadt had\r\nproved that to demonstration. From a height of several thousand feet,\r\nand a distance of nearly seven miles, the unknown air-vessel had\r\npractically destroyed, with four shots from her mysterious,\r\nsmokeless, and flameless guns, the strongest fortress in Europe. If\r\nit could do that, and there was not the slightest doubt but that it\r\nhad done so, it could destroy armies wholesale without a chance of\r\nreprisals, sink fleets, and lay cities in ruins, at the leisure of\r\nthose who commanded it.\r\n\r\nAnd here arose the supreme question of the hour--a question beside\r\nwhich all other questions of national or international policy sank\r\ninstantly into insignificance--Who were those who held this new and\r\nappalling power in their hands? It was hardly to be believed that\r\nthey were representatives of any regularly-constituted national\r\nPower, for, although the air was full of rumours of war, there was at\r\npresent unbroken peace all over the world.\r\n\r\nEven in the hands of a recognised Power, the possession of such a\r\nfrightful engine of destruction could not be viewed by the rest of\r\nthe world with anything but the gravest apprehension, for that Power,\r\nhowever insignificant otherwise, would now be in a position to\r\nterrorise any other nation, or league of nations, however great.\r\nManifestly those who had built the one air-vessel that had been seen,\r\nand had given such conclusive proof of her terrible powers, could\r\nconstruct a fleet if they chose to do so, and then the world would be\r\nat their mercy.\r\n\r\nIf, however, as seemed only too probable, the machine was in the\r\nhands of a few irresponsible individuals, or, still worse, in those\r\nof such enemies of humanity as the Nihilists, or that yet more\r\nmysterious and terrible society who were popularly known as the\r\nTerrorists, then indeed the outlook was serious beyond forecast or\r\ndescription. At any moment the forces of destruction and anarchy\r\nmight be let loose upon the world, in such fashion that little less\r\nthan the collapse of the whole fabric of Society might be expected as\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe above necessarily brief and imperfect digest gives only the\r\nheadings of an article which filled nearly two columns of the\r\n_Times_, and it is needless to say that such an article in the\r\nleading columns of the most serious and respectable newspaper in the\r\nworld produced an intense impression wherever it was read.\r\n\r\nOf course the telegram was instantly copied by the evening papers,\r\nwhich ran out special editions for the sole purpose of reproducing\r\nit, with their own comments upon it, which, after all, were not much\r\nmore original than the telegram. Meanwhile the _Berliner Tageblatt_,\r\nthe _Newe Freie Presse_, the _Kölnische Zeitung_, and the _Journal\r\ndes Débats_ had received later and somewhat similar telegrams, and\r\nhad given their respective views of the catastrophe to the world.\r\n\r\nBy noon all the capitals of Europe were in a fever of expectation and\r\napprehension. The cables had carried the news to America and India;\r\nand when the evening of the same day brought the telegraphic account\r\nof the extraordinary occurrence at Tiumen in the grey dusk of the\r\nearly morning, proving almost conclusively that the rescue had been\r\neffected by the same agency that had destroyed Kronstadt, and that,\r\nworse than all, the air-vessel was at the command of Natas, the\r\nunknown Chief of the mysterious Terrorists, excitement rose almost to\r\nfrenzy, and everywhere the wildest rumours were accepted as truth.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the \"psychological moment\" had come all over Europe, the\r\nmoment in which all men were thinking of the same thing, discussing\r\nthe same event, and dreading the same results. To have found a\r\nparallel state of affairs, it would have been necessary to go back\r\nmore than a hundred years, to the hour when the head of Louis XVI.\r\nfell into the basket of the guillotine, and the monarchies of Europe\r\nsprang to arms to avenge his death.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other and not less momentous events had, unknown to the\r\nnewspapers or the public, been taking place in three very different\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Saturday, the 6th, Lord Alanmere had called upon\r\nMr. Balfour in Downing Street, and laid the duplicates of the secret\r\ntreaty between France and Russia, and copies of all the memoranda\r\nappertaining to it, before him, and had convinced him of their\r\nauthenticity. At the same time he showed him plans of the\r\nwar-balloons, of which a fleet of fifty would within a few days be at\r\nthe command of the Tsar.\r\n\r\nThe result of this interview was a meeting of a Cabinet Council, and\r\nthe immediate despatch of secret orders to mobilise the fleet and the\r\narmy, to put every available ship into commission, and to double the\r\nstrength of the Mediterranean Squadron at once. That evening three\r\nQueen's messengers left Charing Cross by the night mail, one for\r\nBerlin, one for Vienna, and one for Rome, each of them bearing a copy\r\nof the secret treaty.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning a Council of Ministers was held at the Peterhof\r\nPalace in St. Petersburg, presided over by the Tsar, and convened to\r\ndiscuss the destruction of Kronstadt.\r\n\r\nAt this Council it was announced that the fleet of war-balloons would\r\nbe ready to take the air in a week's time from then, and that the\r\nconcentration of troops on the Afghan frontier was as complete as it\r\ncould be without provoking immediate hostilities with Britain. In\r\nfact, so close were the Cossacks and the Indian troops to each other,\r\nboth on the Pamirs and on the western slopes of the Hindu Kush, that\r\na collision might be expected at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Tsar decided to let matters take their course in\r\nthe East, and to make all arrangements with France to simultaneously\r\nattack the Triple Alliance as soon as the war-balloons had been\r\nsatisfactorily tested.\r\n\r\nSoon after daybreak on Wednesday, the 10th, an affair of outposts\r\ntook place near the northern end of the Sir Ulang Pass of the Hindu\r\nKush, between two considerable bodies of Cossacks and Ghoorkhas, in\r\nwhich, after a stubborn fight, the Russians gave way before the\r\nmagazine fire of the Indian troops, and fled, leaving nearly a fourth\r\nof their number on the field.\r\n\r\nThe news of this encounter reached London on Wednesday night, and was\r\npublished in the papers on Thursday morning, together with the\r\nintelligence that the fight had been watched from a height of nearly\r\nthree thousand feet by a small party of men and women in an air-ship,\r\nevidently a vessel of war, from the fact that she carried four long\r\nguns. She took no part in the fight, and as soon as it was over went\r\noff to the south-west at a speed which carried her out of sight in a\r\nfew minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile all Europe was thrilling with the apprehension of approaching\r\nwar, and the excitement caused by the appearance of the strange\r\nair-ship and the news of its terrible exploits at Kronstadt and\r\nTiumen, the _Ariel_ herself was quietly pursuing her way in mid-air\r\nsouth-westerly from the scene of the skirmish outside the Sir Ulang\r\nPass.\r\n\r\nShe was bound for a region in the midst of Africa, which, even in the\r\nfirst decade of the twentieth century, was still unknown to the\r\ngeographer and untrodden by the explorer.\r\n\r\nFenced in by huge and precipitous mountains, round whose bases lay\r\nvast forests and impenetrable swamps and jungles, from whose deadly\r\nareas the boldest pioneers had turned aside as being too hopelessly\r\ninhospitable to repay the cost and toil of exploration, it had\r\nremained undiscovered and unknown save by two men, who had reached it\r\nby the only path by which it was accessible--through the air and over\r\nthe mountains which shut it in on every side from the external world.\r\n\r\nThese two adventurous travellers were a wealthy and eccentric\r\nEnglishman, named Louis Holt, and Thomas Jackson, his devoted\r\nretainer, and these two had taken it into their heads--or rather\r\nLouis Holt had taken it into his head--to achieve in fact the feat\r\nwhich Jules Verne had so graphically described in fiction, and to\r\ncross Africa in a balloon.\r\n\r\nThey had set out from Zanzibar towards the end of the last year of\r\nthe nineteenth century, and, with the exception of one or two vague\r\nreports from the interior, nothing more had been heard of them until,\r\nnearly a year later, a collapsed miniature balloon had been picked up\r\nin the Gulf of Guinea by the captain of a trading steamer, who had\r\nfound in the little car attached to it a hermetically sealed\r\nmeat-tin, which contained a manuscript, the contents of which will\r\nbecome apparent in due course.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the steamer was a practical and somewhat stupid man,\r\nwho read the manuscript with considerable scepticism, and then put it\r\naway, having come to the conclusion that it was no business of his,\r\nand that there was no money in it anyhow. He thought nothing more of\r\nit until he got back to Liverpool, and then he gave it to a friend of\r\nhis, who was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and who duly\r\nlaid it before that body.\r\n\r\nIt was published in the _Transactions_, and there was some talk of\r\nsending out an expedition under the command of an eminent explorer to\r\nrescue Louis Holt and his servant; but when that personage was\r\napproached on the subject, it was found that the glory would not be\r\nat all commensurate with the expense and risk, and so, after being\r\nthe usual nine days' wonder, and being duly elaborated by several\r\nable editors in the daily and weekly press, the strange adventures of\r\nLouis Holt had been dismissed, as of doubtful authenticity, into the\r\nlimbo of exhausted sensations.\r\n\r\nOne man, however, had laid the story to heart somewhat more\r\nseriously, and that was Richard Arnold, who, on reading it, had\r\nformed the resolve that, if ever his dream of aërial navigation were\r\nrealised, the first use he would make of his air-ship would be to\r\ndiscover and rescue the lonely travellers who were isolated from the\r\nrest of the world in the strange, inaccessible region of which the\r\nmanuscript had given a brief but graphic and fascinating account. He\r\nwas now carrying out that resolve, and at the same time working out a\r\nportion of a plan that was not his own, and which he had been very\r\nfar from foreseeing when he made the resolution.\r\n\r\nLouis Holt's original MS. had been purchased by the President of the\r\nInner Circle, and the _Ariel_ was now, in fact, on a voyage of\r\nexploration, the object of which was the discovery of this unknown\r\nregion, with a view to making it the seat of a settlement from which\r\nthe members of the Executive could watch in security and peace the\r\ncourse of the tremendous struggle which would, ere long, be shaking\r\nthe world to its foundations.\r\n\r\nIn such a citadel as this, fenced in by a series of vast natural\r\nobstacles, impassable to all who did not possess the means of aërial\r\nlocomotion, they would be secure from molestation, though all the\r\narmies of Europe sought to attack them; and the _Ariel_ could, if\r\nnecessary, traverse in twenty-five hours the three thousand odd miles\r\nwhich separated it from the centre of Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter the rescue of Natasha and the Princess on the Tobolsk road, the\r\n_Ariel_, in obedience to the orders of the Council, had shaped her\r\ncourse southward to the western slopes of the Hindu Kush, in order to\r\nbe present at the prearranged attack of the Cossacks on the British\r\nreconnoitring force.\r\n\r\nArnold's orders were simply to wait for the engagement, and only to\r\nwatch it, unless the British were attacked in overwhelming numbers.\r\nIn that case he was to have dispersed the Russian force, as the plan\r\nof the Terrorists did not allow of any advantage being gained by the\r\nsoldiers of the Tsar in that part of the world just then.\r\n\r\nAs the British had defeated them unaided, the _Ariel_ had taken no\r\npart in the affair, and, after vanishing from the sight of the\r\nastonished combatants, had proceeded upon her voyage of discovery.\r\n\r\nAs a good month would have to elapse before she could keep her\r\nrendezvous with the steamer that was to bring out the materials for\r\nthe construction of the new air-ships from England, there was plenty\r\nof time to make the voyage in a leisurely and comfortable fashion. As\r\nsoon, therefore, as he was out of sight of the skirmishers, he had\r\nreduced the speed of the _Ariel_ to about forty miles an hour, using\r\nonly the stern-propeller driven by one engine, and supporting the\r\nship on the air-planes and two fan-wheels.\r\n\r\nAt this speed he would traverse the three thousand odd miles which\r\nlay between the Hindu Kush and \"Aeria\"--as Louis Holt had somewhat\r\nfancifully named the region that could be reached only through the\r\nair--in a little over seventy-five hours, or rather more than three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThose three days were the happiest that his life had so far\r\ncontained. The complete success of his invention, and the absolute\r\nfulfilment of his promises to the Brotherhood, had made him a power\r\nin the world, and a power which, as he honestly believed, would be\r\nused for the highest good of mankind when the time came to finally\r\nconfront and confound the warring forces of rival despotisms.\r\n\r\nBut far more than this in his eyes was the fact that he had been able\r\nto use the unique power which his invention had placed in his hands,\r\nto rescue the woman that he loved so dearly from a fate which, even\r\nnow that it was past, he could not bring himself to contemplate.\r\n\r\nWhen she had first greeted him in the Council-chamber of the Inner\r\nCircle, the distance that had separated her from him had seemed\r\nimmeasurable, and she--the daughter of Natas and the idol of the most\r\npowerful society in the world--might well have looked down upon\r\nhim--the nameless dreamer of an unrealised dream, and a pauper, who\r\nwould not have known where to have looked for his next meal, had the\r\nBrotherhood not had faith in him and his invention.\r\n\r\nBut now all that was changed. The dream had become the reality, and\r\nthe creation of his genius was bearing her with him swiftly and\r\nsmoothly through a calm atmosphere, and under a cloudless sky, over\r\nsea and land, with more ease than a bird wings its flight through\r\nspace. He had accomplished the greatest triumph in the history of\r\nhuman discovery. He had revolutionised the world, and ere long he\r\nwould make war impossible. Surely this entitled him to approach even\r\nher on terms of equality, and to win her for his own if he could.\r\n\r\nNatasha saw this too as clearly as he did--more clearly, perhaps;\r\nfor, while he only arrived at the conclusion by a process of\r\nreasoning, she reached it intuitively at a single step. She knew that\r\nhe loved her, that he had loved her from the moment that their hands\r\nhad first met in greeting, and, peerless as she was among women, she\r\nwas still a woman, and the homage of such a man as this was sweet to\r\nher, albeit it was still unspoken.\r\n\r\nShe knew, too, that the hopes of the Revolution, which, before all\r\nthings human, claimed her whole-souled devotion, now depended mainly\r\nupon him, and the use that he might make of the power that lay in his\r\nhands, and this of itself was no light bond between them, though not\r\nnecessarily having anything to do with affection.\r\n\r\nSo far she was heart-whole, and though many had attempted the task,\r\nno man had yet made her pulses beat a stroke faster for his sake.\r\nEver since she had been old enough to know what tyranny meant, she\r\nhad been trained to hate it, and prepared to work against it, and, if\r\nnecessary, to sacrifice herself body and soul to destroy it.\r\n\r\nThus hatred rather than love had been the creed of her life and the\r\nmainspring of her actions, and, save her father and her one friend\r\nRadna, she stood aloof from mankind and its loves and friendships,\r\nrather the beautiful incarnation of an abstract principle than a\r\nwoman, to whom love and motherhood were the highest aims of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nMore than this, she was the daughter of a Jew, and therefore held\r\nherself absolutely at her father's disposal as far as marriage was\r\nconcerned, and if he had given her in wedlock even to a Russian\r\nofficial, telling her that the Cause demanded the sacrifice, she\r\nwould have obeyed, though her heart had broken in the same hour.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had never hinted directly at such a thing, the conviction\r\nhad been growing upon her for the last two or three years that Natas\r\nreally intended her to marry Tremayne, and so, in the case of his own\r\ndeath, form a bond that should hold him to the Brotherhood when the\r\nchain of his own control was snapped. Though she instinctively shrank\r\nfrom such a union of mere policy, she would enter it without\r\nhesitation at her father's bidding, and for the sake of the Cause to\r\nwhich her life was devoted.\r\n\r\nHow great such a sacrifice would be, should it ever be asked of her,\r\nno one but herself could ever know, for she was perfectly well aware\r\nthat in Tremayne's strange double life there were two loves, one of\r\nwhich, and that not the real and natural one, was hers.\r\n\r\nHad she felt that she had the disposal of herself in her own hands,\r\nshe would not, perhaps, have waited with such painful apprehension\r\nthe avowal which hour after hour, now that they were brought into\r\nsuch close and constant relationships on board this little vessel\r\nhigh in mid-air, she saw trembling on the lips of her rescuer.\r\n\r\nArnold's life of hard, honest work, and his constant habit of facing\r\ntruth in its most uncompromising forms, had made dissimulation almost\r\nimpossible to him; and added to that, situated as he was, there was\r\nno necessity for it. Colston knew of his love, and the Princess had\r\nguessed it long ago. Did Natasha know his open secret? Of that he\r\nhardly dared to be sure, though something told him that the\r\ninevitable moment of knowledge was near at hand.\r\n\r\nFor the first twenty-four hours of the voyage he had seen very little\r\nof either her or the Princess, as they had mostly remained in their\r\ncabins, enjoying a complete rest after the terrible fatigue and\r\nsuffering they had gone through since their capture in Moscow, but on\r\nthe Thursday morning they had had breakfast in the saloon with him\r\nand Colston, and had afterwards spent a portion of the morning on\r\ndeck, deeply interested in watching the fight between the British and\r\nRussians. Thanks to Radna's foresight, they had each found a trunk\r\nfull of suitable clothing on board the _Ariel_. These had been taken\r\nto Drumcraig by Colston, and placed in the cabins intended for their\r\nuse, and so they were able to discard the uncouth but useful costumes\r\nin which they had made their escape.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Arnold had had to perform the pleasant task of\r\nshowing them over the _Ariel_, explaining the working of the\r\nmachinery, and putting the wonderful vessel through various\r\nevolutions to show what she was capable of doing.\r\n\r\nHe rushed her at full speed through the air, took flying leaps over\r\noutlying spurs of mountain ranges that lay in their path, swooped\r\ndown into valleys, and flew over level plains fifty yards from the\r\nground, like an albatross over the surface of a smooth tropic sea.\r\nThen he soared up from the earth again, until the horizon widened out\r\nto vast extent, and they could see the mighty buttresses of \"the Roof\r\nof the World\" stretching out below them in an endless succession of\r\nranges as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\nNeither Natasha nor the Princess could find words to at all\r\nadequately express all that they saw and learnt during that day of\r\nwonders, and all night Natasha could hardly sleep for waking dreams\r\nof universal empire, and a world at peace equitably ruled by a power\r\nthat had no need of aggression, because all the realms of earth and\r\nair belonged to those who wielded it.\r\n\r\nWhen at last she did go to sleep, it was to dream again, and this\r\ntime of herself, the Angel of the Revolution, sharing the aërial\r\nthrone of the world-empire with the man who had made revolutions\r\nimpossible by striking the sword from the hand of the tyrants of\r\nearth for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA WOOING IN MID AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast on the Friday morning, Natasha and Arnold were\r\nstanding in the bows of the _Ariel_, admiring the magnificent\r\npanorama that lay stretched out five thousand feet below them.\r\n\r\nThe air-ship had by this time covered a little over 2000 miles of her\r\nvoyage, and was now speeding smoothly and swiftly along over the\r\nsouth-western shore of the Red Sea, a few miles southward of the\r\nsixteenth parallel of latitude. Eastward the bright blue waves of the\r\nsea were flashing behind them in the cloudless morning sun; the high\r\nmountains of the African coast rose to right and left and in front of\r\nthem; and through the breaks in the chain they could see the huge\r\nmasses of Abyssinia to the southward, and the vast plains that\r\nstretched away westward across the Blue and White Niles, away to the\r\nconfines of the Libyan Desert.\r\n\r\n\"What a glorious world!\" exclaimed Natasha, after gazing for many\r\nsilent minutes with entranced eyes over the limitless landscape. \"And\r\nto think that, after all, all this is but a little corner of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is yours, Natasha, if you will have it,\" replied Arnold quietly,\r\nyet with a note in his voice that warned her that the moment which\r\nshe had expected and yet dreaded, had already come. There was no use\r\nin avoiding the inevitable for a time. It would be better if they\r\nunderstood each other at once; and so she looked round at him with\r\neyebrows elevated in well-simulated surprise, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Mine! What do you mean, my friend?\"\r\n\r\nThere was an almost imperceptible emphasis on the last word that\r\nbrought the blood to Arnold's cheek, and he answered, with a ring in\r\nhis voice that gave unmistakable evidence of the effort that he was\r\nmaking to restrain the passion that inspired his words--\r\n\r\n\"I mean just what I say. All the kingdoms of the world, and the glory\r\nof them, from pole to pole, and from east to west, shall be yours,\r\nand shall obey your lightest wish. I have conquered the air, and\r\ntherefore the earth and sea. In two months from now I shall have an\r\naërial navy afloat that will command the world, and I--is it not\r\nneedless to tell you, Natasha, why I glory in the possession of that\r\npower? Surely you must know that it is because I love you more than\r\nall that a subject world can give me, and because it makes it\r\npossible for me, if not to win you, at least not to be unworthy to\r\nattempt the task?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a distinctly unconventional declaration--such a one, indeed,\r\nas no woman had ever heard since Alexander the Great had whispered in\r\nthe ears of Lais his dreams of universal empire, but there was a\r\nstraightforward earnestness about it which convinced her beyond\r\nquestion that it came from no ordinary man, but from one who saw the\r\ntask before him clearly, and had made up his mind to achieve it.\r\n\r\nFor a moment her heart beat faster than it had ever yet done at the\r\nbidding of a man's voice, and there was a bright flush on her cheeks,\r\nand a softer light in her eyes, as she replied in a more serious tone\r\nthan Arnold had ever heard her use--\r\n\r\n\"My friend, you have forgotten something. You and I are not a man and\r\na woman in the relationship that exists between us. We are two\r\nfactors in a work such as has never been undertaken since the world\r\nbegan; two units in a mighty problem whose solution is the happiness\r\nor the ruin of the whole human race. It is not for us to speak of\r\nindividual love while these tremendous issues hang undecided in the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\"One does not speak of love in the heat of war, and you and I and\r\nthose who are with us are at war with the powers of the earth, and\r\nhigher things than the happiness of individuals are at stake. You\r\nknow my training has been one of hate and not of love, and till the\r\nhate is quenched I must not know what love is.\r\n\r\n\"Remember your oath--the oath which I have taken as well as you--'_As\r\nlong as I live those ends shall be my ends, and no human\r\nconsiderations shall weigh with me where those ends are concerned._'\r\nIs not this love of which you speak a human consideration that might\r\nclash with the purposes of the Brotherhood whose ends you and I have\r\nsolemnly sworn to hold supreme above all earthly things?\r\n\r\n\"My father has told me that when love takes possession of a human\r\nsoul, reason abdicates her throne, and great aims become impossible.\r\nNo, no; that great power which you hold in your hands was not given\r\nyou just to win the love of a woman, and I tell you frankly that you\r\nwill never win mine with it.\r\n\r\n\"More than this, if I saw you using it for such an end, I would take\r\ncare that you did not use it for long. No man ever had such an awful\r\nresponsibility laid upon him as the possession of this power lays\r\nupon you. It is yours to make or mar the future of the human race, of\r\nwhich I am but a unit. It is not the power that will ever win either\r\nmy respect or my love, but the wisdom and the justice with which it\r\nmay be used.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I see you distrust me. You think that because I have the power\r\nto be a despot, that therefore I may forget my oath and become one. I\r\nforgive you for the thought, unworthy of you as it is, and also, I\r\nhope, of me. No, Natasha; I am no skilled hand at love-making, for I\r\nhave never wooed any mistress but one before to-day, and she is won\r\nonly by plain honesty and hard service; just what I will devote to\r\nthe winning of you, whether you are to be won or not--but I must have\r\nexpressed myself clumsily indeed for you to have even thought of\r\ntreason to the Cause.\r\n\r\n\"You are no more devoted adherent of it than I am. You have suffered\r\nin one way and I in another from the falsehood and rottenness of\r\npresent-day Society, but you do not hate it more utterly than I do,\r\nand you would not go to greater lengths than I would to destroy it.\r\nYours is a hatred of emotion, and mine is a hatred of reason. I have\r\nproved that, as Society is constituted, it is the worst and not the\r\nbest qualities of humanity that win wealth and power, and such\r\nrespect as the vulgar of all classes can give. But it is not such\r\npower as this that I would lay at your feet, when I ask you to share\r\nthe world-empire with me. It is an empire of peace and not of war\r\nthat I shall offer to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Natasha, taking a step towards him, and laying her hand\r\non his arm as she spoke, \"when you have made war impossible to the\r\nrivalry of nations and races, and have proclaimed peace on earth,\r\nthen I will give myself to you, body and soul, to do with as you\r\nplease, to kill or to keep alive, for then truly you will have done\r\nthat which all the generations of men before you have failed to do,\r\nand it will be yours to ask and to have.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke these last words Natasha bowed her proudly-carried head\r\nas though in submission to the dictum that her own lips had\r\npronounced; and Arnold, laying his hand on hers and holding it for a\r\nmoment unresisting in his own, said--\r\n\r\n\"I accept the condition, and as you have said so shall it be. You\r\nshall hear no more words of love from my lips until the day that\r\npeace shall be proclaimed on earth and war shall be no more; and when\r\nthat day comes, as it shall do, I will hold you to your words, and I\r\nwill claim you and take you, body and soul, as you have said, though\r\nI break every other human tie save man's love for woman to possess\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nNatasha looked him full in the eyes as he spoke these last words. She\r\nhad never heard such words before, and by their very strength and\r\naudacity they compelled her respect and even her submission. Her\r\nheart was still untamed and unconquered, and no man was its lord, yet\r\nher eyes sank before the steady gaze of his, and in a low sweet voice\r\nshe answered--\r\n\r\n\"So be it! There never was a true woman yet who did not love to meet\r\nher master. When that day comes I shall have met my master, and I\r\nwill do his bidding. Till then we are friends and comrades in a\r\ncommon Cause to which both our lives are devoted. Is it not better\r\nthat it should be so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am content. I would not take the prize before I have won it.\r\nOnly answer me one question frankly, and then I have done till I may\r\nspeak again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I a rival--not among men, for of that I am careless--but in\r\nyour own heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, none. I am heart-whole and heart-free. Win me if you can. It is\r\na fair challenge, and I will abide by the result, be it what it may.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all I ask for. If I do not win you, may Heaven do so to me\r\nthat I shall have no want of the love of woman for ever!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he raised her hand to his lips and kissed it, in token of\r\nthe compact that was made between them. Then, intuitively divining\r\nthat she wished to be alone, he turned away without another word, and\r\nwalked to the after end of the vessel.\r\n\r\nNatasha remained where she was for a good half-hour, leaning on the\r\nrail that surrounded the deck, and gazing out dreamily over the\r\nsplendid and ever-changing scene that lay spread out beneath her.\r\nTruly it was a glorious world, as she had said, even now, cursed as\r\nit was with war and the hateful atrocities of human selfishness, and\r\nthe sordid ambition of its despots.\r\n\r\nWhat would it be like in the day when the sword should lie rusting on\r\nthe forgotten battle-field, and the cannon's mouth be choked with the\r\ndesert dust for ever? What was now a hell of warring passions would\r\nthen be a paradise of peaceful industry, and he who had the power, if\r\nany man had, to turn that hell into the paradise that it might be,\r\nhad just told her that he loved her, and would create that paradise\r\nfor her sake.\r\n\r\nCould he do it? Was not this marvellous creation of his genius, that\r\nwas bearing her in mid-air over land and sea, as woman had never\r\ntravelled before, a sufficient earnest of his power? Truly it was.\r\nAnd to be won by such a man was no mean destiny, even for her, the\r\ndaughter of Natas, and the peerless Angel of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nSituated as they were, it would of course have been impossible, even\r\nif it had been in any way desirable, for Arnold and Natasha to have\r\nkept their compact secret from their fellow-travellers, who were at\r\nthe same time their most intimate friends.\r\n\r\nThere was not, however, the remotest reason for attempting to do so.\r\nAlthough with regard to the rest of the world the members of the\r\nBrotherhood were necessarily obliged to live lives of constant\r\ndissimulation, among themselves they had no secrets from each other.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, it was perfectly well known that Tremayne, during\r\nthose periods of his double life in which he acted as Chief of the\r\nInner Circle, regarded the daughter of Natas with feelings much\r\nwarmer than those of friendship or brotherhood in a common cause, and\r\nuntil Arnold and his wonderful creation appeared on the scene, he was\r\nlooked upon as the man who, if any man could, would some day win the\r\nheart of their idolised Angel.\r\n\r\nOf the other love that was the passion of his other life, no one save\r\nNatasha, and perhaps Natas himself, knew anything; and even if they\r\nhad known, they would not have considered it possible for any other\r\nwoman to have held a man's heart against the peerless charms of\r\nNatasha. In fact they would have looked upon such rivalry as mere\r\npresumption that it was not at all necessary for their incomparable\r\nyoung Queen of the Terror to take into serious account.\r\n\r\nIn Arnold, however, they saw a worthy rival even to the Chief\r\nhimself, for there was a sort of halo of romance, even in their eyes,\r\nabout this serious, quiet-spoken young genius, who had come suddenly\r\nforth from the unknown obscurity of his past life to arm the\r\nBrotherhood with a power which revolutionised their tactics and\r\nvirtually placed the world at their mercy. In a few months he had\r\nbecome alike their hero and their supreme hope, so far as all active\r\noperations went; and now that with his own hand he had snatched\r\nNatasha from a fate of unutterable misery, and so signally punished\r\nher persecutors, it seemed to be only in the fitness of things that\r\nhe should love her, win her for his own, if won she was to be by any\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThis, at any rate, was the line of thought which led the Princess and\r\nColston each to express their unqualified satisfaction with the state\r\nof affairs arrived at in the compact that had been made between\r\nNatasha and Arnold--\"armed neutrality,\" as the former smilingly\r\ndescribed to the Princess while she was telling her of the strange\r\nwooing of her now avowed lover. Natasha was no woman to be wooed and\r\nwon in the ordinary way, and it was fitting that she should be the\r\nguerdon of such an achievement as no man had ever undertaken before,\r\nsince the world began.\r\n\r\nThe voyage across Africa progressed pleasantly and almost\r\nuneventfully for the thirty-six hours after the crossing of the Red\r\nSea. After passing over the mountains of the coast, the _Ariel_ had\r\ntravelled at a uniform height of about 3000 feet over a magnificent\r\ncountry of hill and valley, forest and prairie, occasionally being\r\nobliged to rise another thousand feet or so to cross some of the\r\nridges of mountain chains which rose into peaks and mountain knots,\r\nsome of which touched the snow-line.\r\n\r\nSeveral times the air-ship was sighted by the people of the various\r\ncountries over which she passed, and crowds swarmed out of the\r\nvillages and towns, gesticulating wildly, and firing guns and beating\r\ndrums to scare the flying demon away.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice they heard bullets singing through the air, but of\r\nthese they took little heed, beyond quickening the speed of the\r\nair-ship for the time, knowing that there was not a chance in a\r\nhundred thousand of the _Ariel_ being hit, and that even if she were\r\nthe bullet would glance harmlessly off her smooth hull of hardened\r\naluminium.\r\n\r\nOnce only they descended in a delightful little valley among the\r\nmountains, which appeared to be totally uninhabited, and here they\r\nrenewed their store of fresh water, and laid in one of fruit, as well\r\nas taking advantage of the opportunity to stretch their legs on\r\n_terra firma_.\r\n\r\nThis was on the Saturday morning; and when they again rose into the\r\nair to continue their voyage, they saw that they had crossed the\r\ngreat mountain mass that divides the Sahara from the little-known\r\nregions of Equatorial Africa, and that in front of them to the\r\nsouth-west lay, as far as the eye could reach, a boundless expanse of\r\ndense forest and jungle and swamp, a gloomy and forbidding-looking\r\nregion which it would be well-nigh impossible to traverse on foot.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon the four voyagers were gathered in the\r\ndeck-saloon, closely examining a somewhat rudely-drawn chart that was\r\nspread out on the table. It was the map that formed part of the\r\nmanuscript which had been found in the car of Louis Holt's miniature\r\nballoon, and sketched out his route from Zanzibar to Aeria, and the\r\ncountry lying round so far as he had been able to observe it.\r\n\r\n\"This gives us, after all, very little idea of the distance we have\r\nyet to go,\" said Arnold; \"for though Holt has got his latitude\r\npresumably right, we have very little clue to his longitude, for he\r\nsays himself that his watch was stopped in a thunder-storm, and that\r\nin the same storm he lost all count of the distance he had travelled.\r\nAdded to that, he admits that he was blown about for twelve days in\r\none direction and another, so that all we really know is that\r\nsomewhere across this fearful wilderness beneath us we shall find\r\nAeria, but where is still a problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your own idea?\" asked Colston.\r\n\r\n\"Not a very clear one, I must confess. At this elevation we can see\r\nabout sixty miles as the atmosphere is now, and as far as we can see\r\nto the south-west there is nothing but the same kind of country that\r\nwe have under us. We have travelled rather more than 2700 miles since\r\nwe left the Hindu Kush, and according to my reckoning Aeria lies\r\nsomewhere between 3000 and 3200 miles south-west of where we started\r\nfrom on Thursday morning. That means that we are within between three\r\nand five hundred miles of Aeria, unless, indeed, our calculations are\r\nwholly at fault, and at that rate, as we only have about four and a\r\nhalf hours' daylight left, we shall not get there to-day at our\r\npresent speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we go a bit faster?\" put in Natasha. \"You know I and the\r\nPrincess are dying to see this mysterious unknown country that only\r\ntwo other people have ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have but to say so, Natasha, and it is already done,\" replied\r\nArnold, signalling at the same moment to the engine-room by means of\r\na similar arrangement of electric buttons to that which was in the\r\nwheel-house. \"Only you must remember that you must not go out on deck\r\nnow, or you will be blown away like a feather into space.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking the three propellers had begun to revolve at\r\nfull speed, and the _Ariel_ darted forward with a velocity that\r\ncaused the mountains she had just crossed to sink rapidly on the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon the _Ariel_ flew at full speed over the seemingly\r\ninterminable wilderness of swamp and jungle, until, when the\r\nequatorial sun was within a few degrees of the horizon, one of the\r\ncrew, who had been stationed in the conning tower at the bows,\r\nsignalled to call the attention of the man in the wheel-house.\r\nArnold, who was in the after-saloon at the time, heard the signal,\r\nand hurried forward to the look-out. He gave one quick glance ahead,\r\nsignalled \"half-speed\" to the engine-room, and then went aft again to\r\nthe saloon, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Aeria is in sight!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately everyone hastened to the deck saloon, from the windows of\r\nwhich could be seen a huge mass of mountains looming dark and\r\ndistinct against the crimsoning western sky.\r\n\r\nIt rose like some vast precipitous island out of the sea of forest\r\nthat lay about its base; and above the mighty rock-walls that seemed\r\nto rise sheer from the surrounding plain at least a dozen peaks\r\ntowered into the sky, two of their summits covered with eternal snow,\r\nand shining like points of rosy fire in the almost level rays of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as Arnold could judge in the deceptive state of the\r\natmosphere, they were still between thirty and forty miles from it,\r\nand as it would not be safe to approach its lofty cliffs at a high\r\nrate of speed in the half light that would so soon merge into\r\ndarkness, he said to his companions--\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to find a resting-place up among the cliffs on this\r\nside to-night, for we have lost the moon, and unless it were\r\nabsolutely necessary to cross the mountains in the dark, I should not\r\ncare to do so with the ladies on board. Besides, there is no hurry\r\nnow that we are here, and we shall get a much finer first impression\r\nof our new kingdom if we cross at sunrise. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\nAll agreed that this would be the best plan, and so the _Ariel_ ran\r\nup to within a mile of the rocks, and then the forward engine was\r\nconnected with the dynamo, and the searchlight, which had so\r\ndisconcerted the Cossacks on the Tobolsk road, was turned on to the\r\ncliffs, which they carefully explored, until they found a little\r\nplateau covered with luxuriant vegetation and well watered, about two\r\nthousand feet above the plain below.\r\n\r\nHere it was decided to come to a halt for the night, and to reserve\r\nthe exploration of Aeria for the morning, and so the fan-wheels were\r\nsent aloft, and the _Ariel_, after hovering for a few minutes over\r\nthe verdant little plain seeking for a suitable spot to alight in,\r\nsank gently to the earth after her flight of more than three thousand\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nAERIA FELIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one on board the _Ariel_ was astir the next morning as soon as\r\nthe first rays of dawn were shooting across the vast plain that\r\nstretched away to the eastward, and by the time it was fairly\r\ndaylight breakfast was over and all were anxiously speculating as to\r\nwhat they would find on the other side of the tremendous cliffs, on\r\nan eyrie in which they had found a resting-place for the night.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all was ready for a start, Arnold said to Natasha, who was\r\nstanding alone with him on the after part of the deck--\r\n\r\n\"If you would like to steer the _Ariel_ into your new kingdom, I\r\nshall be delighted to give you the lesson in steering that I promised\r\nyou yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nNatasha saw the inner meaning of the offer at a glance, and replied\r\nwith a smile that made his blood tingle--\r\n\r\n\"That would be altogether too great a responsibility for a beginner.\r\nI might run on to some of these fearful rocks. But if you will take\r\nthe helm when the dangerous part comes, I will learn all I can by\r\nwatching you.\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as you are with me in the wheel-house for the next hour or\r\nso,\" said Arnold, with almost boyish frankness, \"I shall be content.\r\nI need scarcely tell you why I want to be alone with you when we\r\nfirst sight this new home of our future empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have half a mind not to come after that very injudicious speech.\r\nStill, if only for the sake of its delightful innocence, I will\r\nforgive you this time. You really must practise the worldly art of\r\ndissimulation a little, or I shall have to get the Princess to play\r\nchaperon.\"\r\n\r\nNatasha spoke these words in a bantering tone, and with a flush on\r\nher lovely cheeks, that forced Arnold to cut short the conversation\r\nfor the moment, by giving an order to Andrew Smith, who at that\r\ninstant put his head out of the wheel-house door to say--\r\n\r\n\"All ready, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Arnold. \"I will take the wheel, and do you tell\r\nevery one to keep under cover.\"\r\n\r\nSmith saluted, and disappeared, and then Natasha and Arnold went into\r\nthe wheel-house, while Colston and the Princess took their places in\r\nthe deck-saloon, the two men off duty going into the conning tower\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"Why every one under cover, Captain Arnold?\" asked Natasha, as soon\r\nas the two were ensconced in the wheel-house and the door shut.\r\n\r\n\"Because I am going to put the _Ariel_ through her paces, and enter\r\nAeria in style,\" replied he, signalling for the fan-wheels to\r\nrevolve. \"The fact is that, so far as I can see, these mountains are\r\ntoo high for us to rise over them by means of the lifting-wheels,\r\nwhich are only calculated to carry the ship to a height of about five\r\nthousand feet. After that the air gets too rarefied for them to get a\r\nsolid grip. Now, these mountains look to me more like seven thousand\r\nfeet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how will you get over them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall first take a cruise and see if I can find a negotiable gap,\r\nand then leap it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Leap seven thousand feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; you forget that we shall be over five thousand up when we take\r\nthe jump, and I have no doubt that we shall find a place where a\r\nthousand feet or so more will take us over. That we shall rise easily\r\nwith the planes and propellers, and you will see such a leap as man\r\nnever made in the world before.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking the _Ariel_ had risen from the ground, and was\r\nhanging a few hundred feet above the little plateau. He gave the\r\nsignal for the wheels to be lowered, and the propellers to set to\r\nwork at half-speed. Then he pulled the lever which moved the\r\nair-planes, and the vessel sped away forwards and upwards at about\r\nsixty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nArnold headed her away from the mountains until he had got an offing\r\nof a couple of miles, and then he swung her round and skirted the\r\ncliffs, rising ever higher and higher, and keeping a sharp look-out\r\nfor a depression among the ridges that still towered nearly three\r\nthousand feet above them.\r\n\r\nWhen he had explored some twenty miles of the mountain wall, Arnold\r\nsuddenly pointed towards it, and said--\r\n\r\n\"There is a place that I think will do. Look yonder, between those\r\ntwo high peaks away to the southward. That ridge is not more than six\r\nthousand feet from the earth, and the _Ariel_ can leap that as easily\r\nas an Irish hunter would take a five-barred gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks dreadfully high from here,\" said Natasha, in spite of\r\nherself turning a shade paler at the idea of taking a six thousand\r\nfoot ridge at a flying leap. She had splendid nerves, but this was\r\nher first aërial voyage, and it was also the first time that she had\r\never been brought so closely face to face with the awful grandeur of\r\nNature in her own secret and solitary places.\r\n\r\nShe would have faced a levelled rifle without flinching, but as she\r\nlooked at that frowning mass of rocks towering up into the sky, and\r\nthen down into the fearful depths below, where huge trees looked like\r\ntiny shrubs, and vast forests like black patches of heather on the\r\nearth, her heart stood still in her breast when she thought of the\r\nfrightful fate that would overwhelm the _Ariel_ and her crew should\r\nshe fail to rise high enough to clear the ridge, or if anything went\r\nwrong with her machinery at the critical moment.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you can do it?\" she asked almost involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly sure,\" replied Arnold quietly, \"otherwise I should not\r\nattempt it with you on board. The _Ariel_ contains enough explosives\r\nto reduce her and us to dust and ashes, and if we hit that ridge\r\ngoing over, she would go off like a dynamite shell. No, I know what\r\nshe can do, and you need not have the slightest fear!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not exactly afraid, but it _looks_ a fearful thing to attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there were any danger I should tell you--with my usual lack of\r\ndissimulation. But really there is none, and all you have to do is to\r\nhold tight when I tell you, and keep your eyes open for the first\r\nglimpse of Aeria.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the _Ariel_ was more than ten miles away from the\r\nmountains. Arnold, having now got offing enough, swung her round\r\nagain, headed her straight for the ridge between the two peaks, and\r\nsignalled \"full speed\" to the engine-room.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the propellers redoubled their revolutions, and the\r\n_Ariel_ gathered way until the wind sang and screamed past her masts\r\nand stays. She covered eight miles in less than four minutes, and it\r\nseemed to Natasha as though the rock-wall were rushing towards them\r\nat an appalling speed, still frowning down a thousand feet above\r\nthem. For the instant she was all eyes. She could neither open her\r\nlips nor move a limb for sheer, irresistible, physical terror. Then\r\nshe heard Arnold say sharply--\r\n\r\n\"Now, hold on tight!\"\r\n\r\nThe nearest thing to her was his own arm, the hand of which grasped\r\none of the spokes of the steering wheel. Instinctively she passed her\r\nown arm under it, and then clasped it with both her hands. As she did\r\nso she felt the muscles tighten and harden. Then with his other hand\r\nhe pulled the lever back to the full, and inclined the planes to\r\ntheir utmost.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as though some Titan had overthrown it, the huge black wall\r\nof rock in front seemed to sink down into the earth, the horizon\r\nwidened out beyond it, and the _Ariel_ soared upwards and swept over\r\nit nearly a thousand feet to the good.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\nThe exclamation was forced from her white lips by an impulse that\r\nNatasha had no power to resist. All the pride of her nature was\r\nconquered and humbled for the moment by the marvel that she had seen,\r\nand by the something, greater and stranger than all, that she saw in\r\nthe man beside her who had worked this miracle with a single touch of\r\nhis hand. A moment later she had recovered her self-possession. She\r\nunclasped her hands from his arm, and as the colour came back to her\r\ncheeks she said, as he thought, more sweetly than she had ever spoken\r\nto him before--\r\n\r\n\"My friend, you have glorious nerves where physical danger is\r\nconcerned, and now I freely forgive you for fainting in the\r\nCouncil-chamber when Martinov was executed. But don't try mine again\r\nlike that if you can help it. For the moment I thought that the end\r\nof all things had come. Oh, look! What a paradise! Truly this is a\r\nlovely kingdom that you have brought me to!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The _Ariel_ sank down after the leap across the\r\nridge.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 123._]\r\n\r\n\"And one that you and I will yet reign over together,\" replied Arnold\r\nquietly, as he moved the lever again and allowed the _Ariel_ to sink\r\nsmoothly down the other side of the ridge over which she had taken\r\nher tremendous leap.\r\n\r\nWhen she had called it a paradise, Natasha had used almost the only\r\nword that would fitly describe the scene that opened out before them\r\nas the _Ariel_ sank down after her leap across the ridge. The\r\ninterior of the mountain mass took the form of an oval valley, as\r\nnearly as they could guess about fifty miles long by perhaps thirty\r\nwide. All round it the mountains seemed to rise unbroken by a single\r\ngap or chasm to between three and four thousand feet above the lowest\r\npart of the valley, and above this again the peaks rose high into the\r\nsky, two of them to the snow-line, which in this latitude was over\r\n15,000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nOf the two peaks which reached to this altitude, one was at either\r\nend of a line drawn through the greater length of the valley, that is\r\nto say, from north to south. At least ten other peaks all round the\r\nwalls of the valley rose to heights varying from eight to twelve\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the valley was occupied by an irregularly shaped lake,\r\nplentifully dotted with islands about its shores, but quite clear of\r\nthem in the middle. In its greatest length it would be about twelve\r\nmiles long, while its breadth varied from five miles to a few hundred\r\nyards. Its sloping shores were covered with the most luxuriant\r\nvegetation, which reached upwards almost unbroken, but changing in\r\ncharacter with the altitude, until there was a regular series of\r\ntransitions, from the palms and bananas on the shores of the lake, to\r\nthe sparse and scanty pines and firs that clung to the upper slopes\r\nof the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe lake received about a score of streams, many of which began as\r\nwaterfalls far up the mountains, while two of them at least had their\r\norigin in the eternal snows of the northern and southern peaks. So\r\nfar as they could see from the air-ship, the lake had no outlet, and\r\nthey were therefore obliged to conclude that its surplus waters\r\nescaped by some subterranean channel, probably to reappear again as a\r\nriver welling from the earth, it might be, hundreds of miles away.\r\n\r\nOf inhabitants there were absolutely no traces to be seen, from the\r\ndirection in which the _Ariel_ was approaching. Animals and birds\r\nthere seemed to be in plenty, but of man no trace was visible, until\r\nin her flight along the valley the _Ariel_ opened up one of the many\r\nsmaller valleys formed by the ribs of the encircling mountains.\r\n\r\nThere, close by a clump of magnificent tree-ferns, and nestling under\r\na precipitous ridge, covered from base to summit with dark-green\r\nfoliage and brilliantly-coloured flowers, was a well-built log-hut\r\nsurrounded by an ample verandah, also almost smothered in flowers,\r\nand surmounted by a flagstaff from which fluttered the tattered\r\nremains of a Union-Jack.\r\n\r\nIn a little clearing to one side of the hut, a man, who might very\r\nwell have passed for a modern edition of Robinson Crusoe, so far as\r\nhis attire was concerned, was busily skinning an antelope which hung\r\nfrom a pole suspended from two trees. His back was turned towards\r\nthem, and so swift and silent had been their approach that he did not\r\nhear the soft whirring of the propellers until they were within some\r\nthree hundred yards of him.\r\n\r\nThen, just as he looked round to see whence the sound came, Andrew\r\nSmith, who was standing in the bows near the conning tower, put his\r\nhands to his mouth and roared out a regular sailor's hail--\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Jackson, ahoy!\"\r\n\r\nThe man straightened himself up, stared open-mouthed for a moment at\r\nthe strange apparition, and then, with a yell either of terror or\r\nastonishment, bolted into the house as hard as he could run.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able to speak for laughing at the queer incident,\r\nArnold sent the fan-wheels aloft and lowered the _Ariel_ to within\r\nabout twenty feet of the ground over a level patch of sward, across\r\nwhich meandered a little stream on its way to the lake. While she was\r\nhanging motionless over this, the man who had fled into the house\r\nreappeared, almost dragging another man, somewhat similarly attired,\r\nafter him, and pointing excitedly towards the _Ariel_.\r\n\r\nThe second comer, if he felt any astonishment at the apparition that\r\nhad invaded his solitude, certainly betrayed none. On the contrary,\r\nhe walked deliberately from the hut to the bit of sward over which\r\nthe _Ariel_ hung motionless, and, seeing two ladies leaning on the\r\nrail that ran round the deck, he doffed his goatskin cap with a\r\nwell-bred gesture, and said, in a voice that betrayed not the\r\nslightest symptom of surprise--\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! Good morning, and welcome to\r\nAeria! I see that the problem of aërial navigation has been solved; I\r\nalways said it would be in the first ten years of the twentieth\r\ncentury, though I often got laughed at by the wiseacres who know\r\nnothing until they see a thing before their noses. May I ask whether\r\nthat little message that I sent to the outside world some years ago\r\nhas procured me the pleasure of this visit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Holt. Your little balloon was picked up about three years\r\nago in the Gulf of Guinea, and, after various adventures and much\r\ndiscussion, has led to our present voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to hear it. I suppose there were plenty of noodles\r\nwho put it down to a practical joke or something of that sort? What's\r\nbecome of Stanley? Why didn't he come out and rescue me, as he did\r\nEmin? Not glory enough, I suppose? It would bother him, too, to get\r\nover these mountains, unless he flew over. By the way, has he got an\r\nair-ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Arnold, with a laugh. \"This is the only one in\r\nexistence, and she has not been a week afloat. But if you'll allow\r\nus, we'll come down and get generally acquainted, and after that we\r\ncan explain things at our leisure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, quite so; do so by all means. Most happy, I'm sure. Ah!\r\nbeautiful model. Comes down as easily as a bird. Capital mechanism.\r\nWhat's your motive-power? Gas, electricity--no, not steam, no\r\nfunnels! Humph! Very ingenious. Always said it would be done some\r\nday. Build flying navies next, and be fighting in the clouds. Then\r\nthere'll be general smash. Serve 'em right. Fools to fight. Why can't\r\nthey live in peace?\"\r\n\r\nWhile Louis Holt was running along in this style, jerking his words\r\nout in little short snappy sentences, and fussing about round the\r\nair-ship, she had sunk gently to the earth, and her passengers had\r\ndisembarked.\r\n\r\nArnold for the time being took no notice of the questions with regard\r\nto the motive-power, but introduced first himself, then the ladies,\r\nand then Colston, to Louis Holt, who may be described here, as\r\nelsewhere, as a little, bronzed, grizzled man, anywhere between\r\nfifty-five and seventy, with a lean, wiry, active body, a good square\r\nhead, an ugly but kindly face, and keen, twinkling little grey eyes,\r\nthat looked straight into those of any one he might be addressing.\r\n\r\nThe introductions over, he was invited on board the _Ariel_, and a\r\nfew minutes later, in the deck-saloon, he was chattering away\r\nthirteen to the dozen, and drinking with unspeakable gusto the first\r\nglass of champagne he had tasted for nearly five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nA NAVY OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nArnold's instructions from the Council had been to remain in Aeria,\r\nand make a thorough exploration of the wonderful region described in\r\nLouis Holt's manuscript, until the time came for him to meet the\r\n_Avondale_, the steamer which was to bring out the materials for\r\nconstructing the Terrorists' aërial navy.\r\n\r\nLouis Holt and his faithful retainer, during the three years and a\r\nhalf that they had been shut up in it from the rest of the world, had\r\nmade themselves so fully acquainted with its geography that very\r\nlittle of its surface was represented by blanks on the map which the\r\nformer had spent several months in constructing, and so no better or\r\nmore willing guides could have been placed at their service than they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nHolt was an enthusiastic naturalist, and he descanted at great length\r\non the strangeness of the flora and fauna that it had been his\r\nprivilege to discover and classify in this isolated and hitherto\r\nunvisited region. It appeared that neither its animals nor its plants\r\nwere quite like those of the rest of the continent, but seemed rather\r\nto belong to an anterior geological age.\r\n\r\nFrom this fact he had come to the conclusion that at some very remote\r\nperiod, while the greater portion of Northern Africa was yet\r\nsubmerged by the waters of that ocean of which what is now the Sahara\r\nwas probably the deepest part, Aeria was one of the many islands that\r\nhad risen above its surface; and that, as the land rose and the\r\nwaters subsided, its peculiar shape had prevented the forms of life\r\nwhich it contained from migrating or becoming modified in the\r\nstruggle for existence with other forms, just as the flora and fauna\r\nof Australia have been shut off from those of the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThere were no traces of human inhabitants to be found; but there were\r\napparently two or three families of anthropoid apes, that seemed, so\r\nfar as Holt had been able to judge--for they were extremely shy and\r\ncunning, and therefore difficult of approach--to be several degrees\r\nnearer to man, both in structure and intelligence, than any other\r\nmembers of the Simian family that had been discovered in other parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nAs may well be imagined, a month passed rapidly and pleasantly away,\r\nwhat with exploring excursions by land and air, in the latter of\r\nwhich by no means the least diverting element was the keen and\r\nquaintly-expressed delight of Louis Holt at the new method of travel.\r\nTwo or three times Arnold had, for his satisfaction, sent the _Ariel_\r\nflying over the ridge across which she had entered Aeria, but he had\r\nalways been content with a glimpse of the outside world, and was\r\nalways glad to get back again to the \"happy valley,\" as he invariably\r\ncalled his isolated paradise.\r\n\r\nThe brief sojourn in this delightful land had brought back all the\r\nroses to Natasha's lovely cheeks, and had completely restored both\r\nher and the Princess to the perfect health that they had lost during\r\ntheir short but terrible experience of Russian convict life; but\r\ntowards the end of the month they both began to get restless and\r\nanxious to get away to the rendezvous with the steamer that was\r\nbringing their friends and comrades out from England.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that an hour or so after sunrise on Friday, the 20th\r\nof May, the company of the _Ariel_ bade farewell for a time to Louis\r\nHolt and his companion, leaving with them a good supply of the\r\ncreature comforts of civilisation which alone were lacking in Aeria,\r\nrose into the air, and disappeared over the ridge to the north-west.\r\n\r\nThey had rather more than 2500 miles of plain and mountain and desert\r\nto cross, before they reached the sea-coast on which they expected to\r\nmeet the steamer, and Arnold regulated the speed of the _Ariel_ so\r\nthat they would reach it about daybreak on the following morning.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was quite uneventful, and the course that they pursued led\r\nthem westward through the Zegzeb and Nyti countries, then\r\nnorth-westward along the valley of the Niger, and then westward\r\nacross the desert to the desolate sandy shores of the Western Sahara,\r\nwhich they crossed at sunrise on the Sunday morning, in the latitude\r\nof the island which was to form their rendezvous with the steamer.\r\n\r\nThey sighted the island about an hour later, but there was no sign of\r\nany vessel for fifty miles round it. The ocean appeared totally\r\ndeserted, as, indeed, it usually is, for there is no trade with this\r\nbarren and savage coast, and ships going to and from the southward\r\nportions of the continent give its treacherous sandbanks as wide a\r\nberth as possible. This, in fact, was the principal reason why this\r\nrocky islet, some sixty miles from the coast, had been chosen by the\r\nTerrorists for their temporary dockyard.\r\n\r\nAccording to their calculations, the steamer would not be due for\r\nanother twenty-four hours at the least, and at that moment would be\r\nabout three hundred miles to the northward. The _Ariel_ was therefore\r\nheaded in that direction, at a hundred miles an hour, with a view to\r\nmeeting her and convoying her for the rest of her voyage, and\r\nobviating such a disaster as Natasha's apprehensions pointed to.\r\n\r\nThe air-ship was kept at a height of two thousand feet above the\r\nwater, and a man was stationed in the forward conning tower to keep a\r\nbright look-out ahead. For more than three hours she sped on her way\r\nwithout interruption, and then, a few minutes before twelve, the man\r\nin the conning tower signalled to the wheel-house--\"Steamer in\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\nThe signal was at once transmitted to the saloon, where Arnold was\r\nsitting with the rest of the party; he immediately signalled\r\n\"half-speed\" in reply to it, and went to the conning tower to see the\r\nsteamer for himself.\r\n\r\nShe was then about twelve miles to the northward. At the speed at\r\nwhich the _Ariel_ was travelling a very few minutes sufficed to bring\r\nher within view of the ocean voyagers. A red flag flying from the\r\nstern of the air-ship was answered by a similar one from the mainmast\r\nof the steamer. The _Ariel's_ engines were at once slowed down, the\r\nfan-wheels went aloft, and she sank gently down to within twenty feet\r\nof the water, and swung round the steamer's stern.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were within hailing distance, those on board the\r\nair-ship recognised Nicholas Roburoff and his wife, Radna Michaelis,\r\nand several other members of the Inner Circle, standing on the bridge\r\nof the steamer. Handkerchiefs were waved, and cries of welcome and\r\ngreeting passed and re-passed from the air to the sea, until Arnold\r\nraised his hand for silence, and, hailing Roburoff, said--\r\n\r\n\"Are you all well on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all well,\" was the reply, \"though we have had rather a risky\r\ntime of it, for war was generally declared a fortnight ago, and we\r\nhave had to run the blockade for a good part of the way. That is why\r\nwe are a little before our time. Can you come nearer? We have some\r\nletters for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Arnold. \"I'll come alongside. You go ahead, I'll do\r\nthe rest.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he ran the _Ariel_ up close to the quarter of the\r\n_Avondale_ as easily as though she had been lying at anchor instead\r\nof going twenty miles an hour through the water, and went forward and\r\nshook hands with Roburoff over the rail, taking a packet of letters\r\nfrom him at the same time. Meanwhile Colston, who had grasped the\r\nsituation at a glance, had swung himself on to the steamer's deck,\r\nand was already engaged in an animated conversation with Radna.\r\n\r\nThe first advantage that Arnold took of the leisure that was now at\r\nhis disposal, was to read the letter directed to himself that was\r\namong those for Natasha, the Princess, and Colston, which had been\r\nbrought out by the _Avondale_. He recognised the writing as\r\nTremayne's, and when he opened the envelope he found that it\r\ncontained a somewhat lengthy letter from him, and an enclosure in an\r\nunfamiliar hand, which consisted of only a few lines, and was signed\r\n\"Natas.\"\r\n\r\nHe started as his eye fell on the terrible name, which now meant so\r\nmuch to him, and he naturally read the note to which it was appended\r\nfirst. There was neither date nor formal address, and it ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    You have done well, and fulfilled your promises as a true man\r\n    should. For the personal service that you have rendered to me I\r\n    will not thank you in words, for the time may come when I shall\r\n    be able to do so in deeds. What you have done for the Cause was\r\n    your duty, and for that I know that you desire no thanks. You\r\n    have proved that you hold in your hands such power as no single\r\n    man ever wielded before. Use it well, and in the ages to come men\r\n    shall remember your name with blessings, and you, if the Master\r\n    of Destiny permits, shall attain to your heart's desire.\r\n\r\n      NATAS.\r\n\r\nArnold laid the little slip of paper down almost reverently, for, few\r\nas the words were, they were those of a man who was not only Natas,\r\nthe Master of the Terror, but also the father of the woman whose\r\nlove, in spite of his oath, was the object to the attainment of which\r\nhe held all things else as secondary, and who therefore had the power\r\nto crown his life-work with the supreme blessing without which it\r\nwould be worthless, however glorious, for he knew full well that,\r\nthough he might win Natasha's heart, she herself could never be his\r\nunless Natas gave her to him.\r\n\r\nThe other letter was from Tremayne, dated more than a fortnight\r\npreviously, and gave him a brief _résumé_ of the course of events in\r\nEurope since his voyage of exploration had begun. It also urged him\r\nto push on the construction of the aërial navy as fast as possible,\r\nas there was now no telling where or how soon its presence might be\r\nrequired to determine the issue of the world-war, the first\r\nskirmishes of which had already taken place in Eastern Europe. Natas\r\nand the Chief were both in London, making the final arrangements for\r\nthe direction of the various diplomatic and military agents of the\r\nBrotherhood throughout Europe. From London they were to go to\r\nAlanmere, where they would remain until all arrangements were\r\ncompleted. As soon as the fleet was built and the crews and\r\ncommanders of the air-ships had thoroughly learned their duties, the\r\nflagship was to go to Plymouth, where the _Lurline_ would be lying.\r\nThe news of her arrival would be telegraphed to Alanmere, and Natas\r\nand Tremayne would at once come south and put to sea in her. The\r\nair-ship was to wait for them at a point two hundred miles due\r\nsouth-west of the Land's End, and pick them up. The yacht was then to\r\nbe sunk, and the Executive of the Terrorists would for the time being\r\nvanish from the sight of men.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that Arnold carried out the plans laid down\r\nin this letter in every detail, and with the utmost possible\r\nexpedition. The _Avondale_ arrived the next day at the island which\r\nhad been chosen as a dockyard, and the ship-building was at once\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nAll the material for constructing the air-ships had been brought out\r\ncompletely finished as far as each individual part was concerned, and\r\nso there was nothing to do but to put them together. The crew and\r\npassengers of the steamer included the members of the Executive of\r\nthe Inner Circle, and sixty picked members of the Outer Circle,\r\nchiefly mechanics and sailors, destined to be first the builders and\r\nthen the crews of the new vessels.\r\n\r\nThese, under Arnold's direction, worked almost day and night at the\r\ntask before them. Three of the air-ships were put together at a time,\r\ntwenty men working at each, and within a month from the time that the\r\n_Avondale_ discharged her cargo, the twelve new vessels were ready to\r\ntake the air.\r\n\r\nThey were all built on the same plan as the _Ariel_, and eleven of\r\nthem were practically identical with her as regards size and speed;\r\nbut the twelfth, the flagship of the aërial fleet, had been designed\r\nby Arnold on a more ambitious scale.\r\n\r\nThis vessel was larger and much more powerful than any of the others.\r\nShe was a hundred feet long, with a beam of fifteen feet amidships.\r\nOn her five masts she carried five fan-wheels, capable of raising her\r\nvertically to a height of ten thousand feet without the assistance of\r\nher air-planes, and her three propellers, each worked by duplex\r\nengines, were able to drive her through the air at a speed of two\r\nhundred miles an hour in a calm atmosphere.\r\n\r\nShe was armed with two pneumatic guns forward and two aft, each\r\ntwenty-five feet long and with a range of twelve miles at an altitude\r\nof four thousand feet; and in addition to these she carried two\r\nshorter ones on each broadside, with a range of six miles at the same\r\nelevation. She also carried a sufficient supply of power-cylinders to\r\ngive her an effective range of operations of twenty thousand miles\r\nwithout replenishing them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the building materials and the necessary tools and\r\nappliances for putting them together, the cargo of the _Avondale_ had\r\nincluded an ample supply of stores of all kinds, not the least\r\nimportant part of which consisted of a quantity of power-cylinders\r\nsufficient to provide the whole fleet three times over.\r\n\r\nThe necessary chemicals and apparatus for charging them were also on\r\nboard, and the last use that Arnold made of the engines of the\r\nsteamer, which he had disconnected from the propeller and turned to\r\nall kinds of uses during the building operations, was to connect them\r\nwith his storage pumps and charge every available cylinder to its\r\nutmost capacity.\r\n\r\nAt length, when everything that could be carried in the air-ships had\r\nbeen taken out of the steamer, she was towed out into deep water, and\r\nthen a shot from one of the flagship's broadside guns sent her to the\r\nbottom of the sea, so severing the last link which had connected the\r\nnow isolated band of revolutionists with the world on which they were\r\nere long to declare war.\r\n\r\nThe naming of the fleet was by common consent left to Natasha, and\r\nher half-oriental genius naturally led her to appropriately name the\r\nair-ships after the winged angels and air-spirits of Moslem and other\r\nEastern mythologies. The flagship she named the _Ithuriel_, after the\r\nangel who was sent to seek out and confound the Powers of Darkness in\r\nthat terrific conflict between the upper and nether worlds, which was\r\na fitting antetype to the colossal struggle which was now to be waged\r\nfor the empire of the earth.\r\n\r\nArnold's first task, as soon as the fleet finally took the air, was\r\nto put the captains and crews of the vessels through a thorough\r\ndrilling in management and evolution. A regular code of signals had\r\nbeen arranged, by means of which orders as to formation, speed,\r\naltitude, and direction could be at once transmitted from the\r\nflagship. During the day flags were used, and at night flashes from\r\nelectric reflectors.\r\n\r\nThe scene of these evolutions was practically the course taken by the\r\n_Ariel_ from Aeria to the island; and as the captains and lieutenants\r\nof the different vessels were all men of high intelligence, and\r\ncarefully selected for the work, and as the mechanism of the\r\nair-ships was extremely simple, the whole fleet was well in hand by\r\nthe time the mountain mass of Aeria was sighted a week after leaving\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nArnold in the _Ithuriel_ led the way to a narrow defile on the\r\nsouth-western side, which had been discovered during his first visit,\r\nand which admitted of entrance to the valley at an elevation of about\r\n3000 feet. Through this the fleet passed in single file soon after\r\nsunrise one lovely morning in the middle of June, and within an hour\r\nthe thirteen vessels had come to rest on the shores of the lake.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time, probably, since the beginning of the world,\r\nthe beautiful valley became the scene of a busy activity, in the\r\nmidst of which the lean wiry figure of Louis Holt seemed to be here,\r\nthere, and everywhere at once, doing the honours of Aeria as though\r\nit were a private estate to which the Terrorists had come by his\r\nspecial invitation.\r\n\r\nHe was more than ever delighted with the air-ships, and especially\r\nwith the splendid proportions of the _Ithuriel_, and the brilliant\r\nlustre of her polished hull, which had been left unpainted, and shone\r\nas though her plates had been of burnished silver. Altogether he was\r\nwell pleased with this invasion of a solitude which, in spite of its\r\ngreat beauty and his professed contempt for the world in general, had\r\nfor the last few months been getting a good deal more tedious than he\r\nwould have cared to admit.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Natas and the Chief, the command of the new colony\r\ndevolved, in accordance with the latter's directions, upon Nicholas\r\nRoburoff, who was a man of great administrative powers, and who set\r\nto work without an hour's delay to set his new kingdom in order,\r\nmarking out sites for houses and gardens, and preparing materials for\r\nbuilding them and the factories for which the water-power of the\r\nvalley was to be utilised.\r\n\r\nArnold, as admiral of the fleet, had transferred the command of the\r\n_Ariel_ to Colston, but he retained him as his lieutenant in the\r\n_Ithuriel_ for the next voyage, partly because he wanted to have him\r\nwith him on what might prove to be a momentous expedition, and partly\r\nbecause Natasha, who was naturally anxious to rejoin her father as\r\nsoon as possible, wished to have Radna for a companion in place of\r\nthe Princess, who had elected to remain in the valley. As another\r\nseparation of the lovers, who, according to the laws of the\r\nBrotherhood, now only waited for the formal consent of Natas to their\r\nmarriage, was not to be thought of, this arrangement gave everybody\r\nthe most perfect satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThree days sufficed to get everything into working order in the new\r\ncolony, and on the morning of the fourth the _Ithuriel_, having on\r\nboard the original crew of the _Ariel_, reinforced by two engineers\r\nand a couple of sailors, rose into the air amidst the cheers of the\r\nassembled colonists, crossed the northern ridge, and vanished like a\r\nsilver arrow into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE EVE OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will now be necessary to go back about six weeks from the day that\r\nthe _Ithuriel_ started on her northward voyage, and to lay before the\r\nreader a brief outline of the events which had transpired in Europe\r\nsubsequently to the date of Tremayne's letter to Arnold.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that day he went down to the House of Lords, to\r\nmake his speech in favour of the Italian Loan. He had previously\r\nspoken some half dozen times since he had taken his seat, and, young\r\nas he was, had always commanded a respectful hearing by his sound\r\ncommon sense and his intimate knowledge of foreign policy, but none\r\nof his brother peers had been prepared for the magnificent speech\r\nthat he had made on this momentous night.\r\n\r\nHe had never given his allegiance to any of the political parties of\r\nthe day, but he was one of the foremost advocates of what was then\r\nknown as the Imperial policy, and which had grown up out of what is\r\nknown in the present day as Imperial Federation. To this he\r\nsubordinated everything else, and held as his highest, and indeed\r\nalmost his only political ideal, the consolidation of Britain and her\r\ncolonies into an empire commercially and politically intact and apart\r\nfrom the rest of the world, self-governing in all its parts as\r\nregards local affairs, but governed as a whole by a representative\r\nImperial Parliament, sitting in London, and composed of delegates\r\nfrom all portions of the empire.\r\n\r\nThis ideal--which, it is scarcely necessary to say, was still\r\nconsidered as \"beyond the range of practical politics\"--formed the\r\nkeynote of such a speech as had never before been heard in the\r\nBritish House of Lords. He commenced by giving a rapid but minute\r\nsurvey of foreign policy, which astounded the most experienced of his\r\nhearers. Not only was it absolutely accurate as far as they could\r\nfollow it, but it displayed an intimate knowledge of involutions of\r\npolicy at which British diplomacy had only guessed.\r\n\r\nMore than this, members of the Government and the Privy Council saw,\r\nto their amazement, that the speaker knew the inmost secrets of their\r\nown policy even better than they did themselves. How he had become\r\npossessed of them was a mystery, and all that they could do was to\r\nsit and listen in silent wonder.\r\n\r\nHe drew a graphic word-picture of the nations of the earth standing\r\nfull-armed on the threshold of such a war as the world had never seen\r\nbefore,--a veritable Armageddon, which would shake the fabric of\r\nsociety to its foundations, even if it did not dissolve it finally in\r\nthe blood of countless battlefields.\r\n\r\nHe estimated with marvellous accuracy the exact amount of force which\r\neach combatant would be able to put on to the field, and summed up\r\nthe appalling mass of potential destruction that was ready to burst\r\nupon the world at a moment's notice. He showed the position of Italy,\r\nand proved to demonstration that if the loan were not immediately\r\ngranted, it would be necessary either for Britain to seize her fleet,\r\nas she did that of Denmark a century before--an act which the\r\nItalians would themselves resist at all hazards--or else to finance\r\nher through the war, as she had financed Germany during the\r\nNapoleonic struggle.\r\n\r\nTo grant the loan would be to save the Italian fleet and army for the\r\nTriple Alliance; to refuse it would be to detach Italy from the\r\nAlliance, and to drive her into the arms of their foes, for not only\r\ncould she not stand alone amidst the shock of the contending Powers,\r\nbut without an immediate supply of ready money she would not be able\r\nto keep the sea for a month.\r\n\r\nThus, he said in conclusion, the fate of Europe, and perhaps of the\r\nworld, lay for the time being in their Lordships' hands. The Double\r\nAlliance was already numerically stronger than the Triple, and,\r\nmoreover, they had at their command a new means of destruction, for\r\nthe dreadful effectiveness of which he could vouch from personal\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe trials of the Russian war-balloons had been secret, it was true,\r\nbut he had nevertheless witnessed them, no matter how, and he knew\r\nwhat they could accomplish. It was true that there were in existence\r\neven more formidable engines than these, but they belonged to no\r\nnation, and were in the hands of those whose hands were against every\r\nman's, and whose designs were still wrapped in the deepest mystery.\r\n\r\nHe therefore besought his hearers not to trust too implicitly to that\r\nhitherto unconquerable valour and resource which had so far rendered\r\nBritain impregnable to her enemies. These were not the days of\r\npersonal valour. They were the days of warfare by machinery, of\r\nwholesale destruction by means which men had never before been called\r\nupon to face, and which annihilated from a distance before mere\r\nvalour had time to strike its blow.\r\n\r\nIf ever the Fates were on the side of the biggest battalions, they\r\nwere now, and, so far as human foresight could predict the issue of\r\nthe colossal struggle, the greatest and the most perfectly equipped\r\narmaments would infallibly insure the ultimate victory, quite apart\r\nfrom considerations of personal heroism and devotion.\r\n\r\nNo such speech had been heard in either House since Edmund Burke had\r\nfulminated against the miserable policy which severed America from\r\nBritain, and split the Anglo-Saxon race in two; but now, as then,\r\npersonal feeling and class prejudice proved too strong for eloquence\r\nand logic.\r\n\r\nItaly was the most intensely Radical State in Europe, and she was\r\nbankrupt to boot; and, added to this, there was a very strong party\r\nin the Upper House which believed that Britain needed no such ally,\r\nthat with Germany and Austria at her side she could fight the world,\r\nin spite of the Tsar's new-fangled balloons, which would probably\r\nprove failures in actual war as similar inventions had done before,\r\nand even if her allies succumbed, had she not stood alone before, and\r\ncould she not do it again if necessary?\r\n\r\nShe would fulfil her engagement with the Triple Alliance, and declare\r\nwar the moment that one of the Powers was attacked, but she would not\r\npour British gold in millions into the bottomless gulf of Italian\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nSuch were the main points in the speech of the Duke of Argyle, who\r\nfollowed Lord Alanmere, and spoke just before the division. When the\r\nfigures were announced, it was found that the Loan Guarantee Bill had\r\nbeen negatived by a majority of seven votes.\r\n\r\nThe excitement in London that night was tremendous. The two Houses of\r\nParliament had come into direct collision on a question which the\r\nPremier had plainly stated to be of vital importance, and a deadlock\r\nseemed inevitable. The evening papers brought out special editions\r\ngiving Tremayne's speech _verbatim_, and the next morning the whole\r\npress of the country was talking of nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe \"leading journals,\" according to their party bias, discussed it\r\npro and con, and rent each other in a furious war of words, the\r\nprelude to the sterner struggle that was to come.\r\n\r\nUnhappily the parties in Parliament were very evenly balanced, and a\r\nvery strong section of the Radical Opposition was, as it always had\r\nbeen, bitterly opposed to the arrangement with the Triple Alliance,\r\nwhich every one suspected and no one admitted until Tremayne\r\nastounded the Lords by reciting its conditions in the course of his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nIt was the avowed object of this section of the Opposition to stand\r\nout of the war at any price till the last minute, and not to fight at\r\nall if it could possibly be avoided. The immediate consequence was\r\nthat, when the Government on the following day asked for an urgency\r\nvote of ten millions for the mobilisation of the Volunteers and the\r\nNaval Reserve, the Opposition, led by Mr. John Morley, mustered to\r\nits last man, and defeated the motion by a majority of eleven.\r\n\r\nThe next day a Cabinet Council was held, and in the afternoon Mr.\r\nBalfour rose in a densely-crowded House, and, after a dignified\r\nallusion to the adverse vote of the previous day, told the House that\r\nin view of the grave crisis which was now inevitable in European\r\naffairs, a crisis in which the fate, not only of Britain, but of the\r\nwhole Western world, would probably be involved, the Ministry felt it\r\nimpossible to remain in office without the hearty and unequivocal\r\nsupport of both Houses--a support which the two adverse votes in\r\nLords and Commons had made it hopeless to look for as those Houses\r\nwere at present constituted.\r\n\r\nHe had therefore to inform the House that, after consultation with\r\nhis colleagues, he had decided to place the resignations of the\r\nMinistry in the hands of his Majesty,[1] and appeal to the country on\r\nthe plain issue of Intervention or Non-intervention. Under the\r\ncircumstances, there was nothing else to be done. The deplorable\r\ncrisis which immediately followed was the logical consequence of the\r\ninherently vicious system of party government.\r\n\r\nWhile the fate of the world was practically trembling in the balance,\r\nEurope, armed to the teeth in readiness for the Titanic struggle that\r\na few weeks would now see shaking the world, was amused by the\r\nspectacle of what was really the most powerful nation on earth losing\r\nits head amidst the excitement of a general election, and frittering\r\naway on the petty issues of party strife the energies that should\r\nhave been devoted with single-hearted unanimity to preparation for\r\nthe conflict whose issue would involve its very existence.\r\n\r\nFor a month the nations held their hand, why, no one exactly knew,\r\nexcept, perhaps, two men who were now in daily consultation in a\r\ncountry house in Yorkshire. It may have been that the final\r\npreparations were not yet complete, or that the combatants were\r\ntaking a brief breathing-space before entering the arena, or that\r\nEurope was waiting to see the decision of Britain at the\r\nballot-boxes, or possibly the French fleet of war-balloons was not\r\nquite ready to take the air,--any of these reasons might have been\r\nsufficient to explain the strange calm before the storm; but\r\nmeanwhile the British nation was busy listening to the conflicting\r\neloquence of partisan orators from a thousand platforms throughout\r\nthe land, and trying to make up its mind whether it should return a\r\nConservative or a Radical Ministry to power.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mr. Balfour came back with a solid hundred majority\r\nbehind him, and at once set to work to, if possible, make up for lost\r\ntime. The moment of Fate had, however, gone by for ever. During the\r\nprecious days that had been fooled away in party strife, French gold\r\nand Russian diplomacy had done their work.\r\n\r\nThe day after the Conservative Ministry returned to power, France\r\ndeclared war, and Russia, who had been nominally at war with Britain\r\nfor over a month, suddenly took the offensive, and poured her Asiatic\r\ntroops into the passes of the Hindu Kush. Two days later, the\r\ndefection of Italy from the Triple Alliance told Europe how\r\naccurately Tremayne had gauged the situation in his now historic\r\nspeech, and how the month of strange quietude had been spent by the\r\ncontrollers of the Double Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe spell was broken at last. After forty years of peace, Europe\r\nplunged into the abyss of war; and from one end of the Continent to\r\nthe other nothing was heard but the tramp of vast armies as they\r\nmarshalled themselves along the threatened frontiers, and\r\nconcentrated at the points of attack and defence.\r\n\r\nOn all the lines of ocean traffic, steamers were hurrying homeward or\r\nto neutral ports, in the hope of reaching a place of safety before\r\nhostilities actually broke out. Great liners were racing across the\r\nAtlantic either to Britain or America with their precious freights,\r\nwhile those flying the French flag on the westward voyage prepared to\r\nrun the gauntlet of the British cruisers as best they might.\r\n\r\nAll along the routes to India and the East the same thing was\r\nhappening, and not a day passed but saw desperate races between fleet\r\nocean greyhounds and hostile cruisers, which, as a rule, terminated\r\nin favour of the former, thanks to the superiority of private\r\nenterprise over Government contract-work in turning out ships and\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nIn Britain the excitement was indescribable. The result of the\r\ngeneral election had cast the final die in favour of immediate war in\r\nconcert with the Triple Alliance. The defection of Italy had\r\nthoroughly awakened the popular mind to the extreme gravity of the\r\nsituation, and the declaration of war by France had raised the blood\r\nof the nation to fever heat. The magic of battle had instantly\r\nquelled all party differences so far as the bulk of the people was\r\nconcerned, and no one talked of anything but the war and its\r\nimmediate issues. Men forgot that they belonged to parties, and only\r\nremembered that they were citizens of the same nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At the period in which the action of the narrative takes\r\nplace, her Majesty Queen Victoria had abdicated in favour of the\r\npresent Prince of Wales, and was living in comparative retirement at\r\nBalmoral, retaining Osborne as an alternative residence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nBETWEEN TWO LIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix weeks after he had made his speech in the House of Lords,\r\nTremayne was sitting in his oak-panelled library at Alanmere, in deep\r\nand earnest converse with a man who was sitting in an invalid chair\r\nby a window looking out upon the lawn. The face of this man exhibited\r\na contrast so striking and at the same time terrible, that the most\r\ncareless glance cast upon it would have revealed the fact that it was\r\nthe face of a man of extraordinary character, and that the story of\r\nsome strange fate was indelibly stamped upon it.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of it, as far down as the mouth, was cast in a mould\r\nof the highest and most intellectual manly beauty. The forehead was\r\nhigh and broad and smooth, the eyebrows dark and firm but finely\r\narched, the nose somewhat prominently aquiline, but well shaped, and\r\nwith delicate, sensitive nostrils. The eyes were deep-set, large and\r\nsoft, and dark as the sky of a moonless night, yet shining in the\r\nfirelight with a strange magnetic glint that seemed to fasten\r\nTremayne's gaze and hold it at will.\r\n\r\nBut the lower portion of the face was as repulsive as the upper part\r\nwas attractive. The mouth was the mouth of a wild beast, and the lips\r\nand cheeks and chin were seared and seamed as though with fire, and\r\nwhat looked like the remains of a moustache and beard stood in black\r\nragged patches about the heavy unsightly jaws.\r\n\r\nWhen the thick, shapeless lips parted, they did so in a hideous grin,\r\nwhich made visible long, sharp white teeth, more like those of a wolf\r\nthan those of a human being.\r\n\r\nHis body, too, exhibited no less strange a contrast than his face\r\ndid. To the hips it was that of a man of well-knit, muscular frame,\r\nnot massive, but strong and well-proportioned. The arms were long and\r\nmuscular, and the hands white and small, but firm, well-shaped, and\r\nnervous.\r\n\r\nBut from his hips downwards, this strange being was a dwarf and a\r\ncripple. His hips were narrow and shrunken, one of his legs was some\r\ninches shorter than the other, and both were twisted and distorted,\r\nand hung helplessly down from the chair as he sat.\r\n\r\nSuch was Natas, the Master of the Terror, and the man whose wrongs,\r\nwhatever they might have been, had caused him to devote his life to a\r\nwork of colossal vengeance, and his incomparable powers to the\r\noverthrow of a whole civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous task to which he had addressed himself with all the\r\nforce of his mighty nature for twenty years, was now at length\r\napproaching completion. The mine that he had so patiently laid, year\r\nafter year, beneath the foundations of Society, was complete in every\r\ndetail, the first spark had been applied, and the first rumbling of\r\nthe explosion was already sounding in the ears of men, though they\r\nlittle knew how much it imported. The work of the master-intellect\r\nwas almost done. The long days and nights of plotting and planning\r\nwere over, and the hour for action had arrived at last.\r\n\r\nFor him there was little more to do, and the time was very near when\r\nhe could retire from the strife, and watch in peace and confidence\r\nthe reaping of the harvest of ruin and desolation that his hands had\r\nsown. Henceforth, the central figure in the world-revolution must be\r\nthe young English engineer, whose genius had brought him forth out of\r\nhis obscurity to take command of the subjugated powers of the air,\r\nand to arbitrate the destinies of the world.\r\n\r\nThis was why he was sitting here, in the long twilight of the June\r\nevening, talking so earnestly with the man who, under the spell of\r\nhis mysterious power and master-will, had been his second self in\r\ncompleting the work that he had designed, and had thought and spoken\r\nand acted as he had inspired him against all the traditions of his\r\nrace and station, in that strange double life that he had lived, in\r\neach portion of which he had been unconscious of all that he had been\r\nand had done in the other. The time had now come to draw aside the\r\nveil which had so far divided these two lives from each other, to\r\nshow him each as it was in very truth, and to leave him free to\r\ndeliberately choose between them.\r\n\r\nNatas had been speaking without any interruption from Tremayne for\r\nnearly an hour, drawing the parallel of the two lives before him with\r\nabsolute fidelity, neither omitting nor justifying anything, and his\r\nwondering hearer had listened to him in silence, unable to speak for\r\nthe crowding emotions which were swarming through his brain. At\r\nlength Natas concluded by saying--\r\n\r\n\"And now, Alan Tremayne, I have shown you faithfully the two paths\r\nwhich you have trodden since first I had need of you. So far you have\r\nbeen as clay in the hands of the potter. Now the spell is removed,\r\nand you are free to choose which of them you will follow to the\r\nend,--that of the English gentleman of fortune and high position,\r\nwhose country is on the brink of a war that will tax her vast\r\nresources to the utmost, and may end in her ruin; or that of the\r\nvisible and controlling head of the only organisation which can at\r\nthe supreme moment be the arbiter of peace or war, order or anarchy,\r\nand which alone, if any earthly power can, will evolve order out of\r\nchaos, and bring peace on earth at last.\"\r\n\r\nAs Natas ceased, Tremayne passed his hand slowly over his eyes and\r\nbrows, as though to clear away the mists which obscured his mental\r\nvision. Then he rose from his chair, and paced the floor with quick,\r\nuneven strides for several minutes. At length he replied, speaking as\r\none might who was just waking from some evil dream--\r\n\r\n\"You have made a conspirator and a murderer of me. How is it possible\r\nthat, knowing this, I can again become what I was before your\r\ninfernal influence was cast about me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you have done at my command is nothing to you, and leaves no\r\nstain upon your honour, if you choose to put it so, for it was not\r\nyour will that was working within you, but mine. As for the killing\r\nof Dornovitch, it was necessary, and you were the only instrument by\r\nwhich it could have been accomplished before irretrievable harm had\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\n\"He alone of the outside world possessed the secret of the Terror. A\r\nwoman of the Outer Circle in Paris had allowed her love for him to\r\novercome her duty to the Brotherhood, and had betrayed what she\r\ncould, in order, as she vainly thought, to shield him from its\r\nvengeance for the executive murders of the year before. He too had on\r\nhim the draft of the secret treaty, the possession of which has\r\nenabled us to control the drift of European politics at the most\r\ncrucial time.\r\n\r\n\"Had he escaped, not only would hundreds of lives have been\r\nsacrificed on suspicion to Russian official vengeance, but Russia and\r\nFrance would now be masters of the British line of communication to\r\nthe East, for it would not have been possible for Mr. Balfour to have\r\nbeen forewarned, and therefore forearmed, in time to double the\r\nMediterranean Squadron as he has done. Surely one Russian's life is\r\nnot too great a price to pay for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not care for the man's life, for he was an enemy, and even then\r\nplotting the ruin of my own country in the dark. It is not the\r\nkilling, but the manner of it. England does not fight her battles\r\nwith the assassin's knife, and his blood is on my hands\"--\r\n\r\n\"On your hands, perhaps, but not on your soul. It is on mine, and I\r\nwill answer for it when we stand face to face at the Bar where all\r\nsecrets are laid bare. The man deserved death, for he was plotting\r\nthe death of thousands. What matter then how or by whose hands he\r\ndied?\r\n\r\n\"It is time the world had done with these miserable sophistries, and\r\nthese spurious distinctions between murder by wholesale and by\r\nretail, and it soon will have done with them. I, by your hand, killed\r\nDornovitch in his sleep. That was murder, says the legal casuist. You\r\nread this morning in the _Times_ how one of the Russian war-balloons\r\nwent the night before last and hung in the darkness over a sleeping\r\ntown on the Austrian frontier, and dropped dynamite shells upon it,\r\nkilling and maiming hundreds who had no personal quarrel with Russia.\r\nThat is war, and therefore lawful!\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, my friend, nonsense! There is no difference. All violence\r\nis crime, if you will, but it is a question of degree only. The world\r\nis mad on this subject of war. It considers the horrible thing\r\nhonourable, and gives its highest distinctions to those who shed\r\nblood most skilfully on the battlefield, and the triumphs that are\r\nwon by superior force or cunning are called glorious, and those who\r\nachieve them the nations fall down and worship.\r\n\r\n\"The nations must be taught wisdom, for war has had victims enough.\r\nBut men are still foolish, and to cure them a terrible lesson will be\r\nnecessary. But that lesson shall be taught, even though the whole\r\nearth be turned into a battlefield, and all the dwellings of men into\r\ncharnel-houses, in order to teach it to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words, Society is to be dissolved in order that anarchy and\r\nlawlessness may take its place. Society may not be perfect,--nay, I\r\nwill grant that its sins are many and grievous, that it has forgotten\r\nits duty both to God and man in its worship of Mammon and its slavery\r\nto externals,--but you who have plotted its destruction, have you\r\nanything better to put in its place? You can destroy, perhaps, but\r\ncan you build up?\"\r\n\r\n\"The jungle must be cleared and the swamp drained before the\r\nhabitations of men can be built in their place. It has been mine to\r\ndestroy, and I will pursue the work of destruction to the end, as I\r\nhave sworn to do by that Name which a Jew holds too sacred for\r\nspeech. I believe myself to be the instrument of vengeance upon this\r\ngeneration, even as Joshua was upon Canaan, and as Khalid the Sword\r\nof God was upon Byzantium in the days of her corruption. You may hold\r\nthis for an old man's fancy if you will, but it shall surely come to\r\npass in the fulness of time, which is now at hand; and then, where I\r\nhave destroyed, may you, if you will, build up again!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? You are speaking in parables.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which shall soon be made plain. You read in your newspaper this\r\nmorning of a mysterious movement that is taking place throughout the\r\nBuddhist peoples of the East. They believe that Buddha has returned\r\nto earth, reincarnated, to lead them to the conquest of the world.\r\nNow, as you know, every fourth man, woman, and child in the whole\r\nhuman race is a Buddhist, and the meaning of this movement is that\r\nthat mighty mass of humanity, pent up and stagnant for centuries, is\r\nabout to burst its bounds and overflow the earth in a flood of\r\ndesolation and destruction.\r\n\r\n\"The nations of the West know nothing of this, and are unsheathing\r\nthe sword to destroy each other. Like a house divided against itself,\r\ntheir power shall be brought to confusion, and their empire be made\r\nas a wilderness. And over the starving and war-smitten lands of\r\nEurope these Eastern swarms shall sweep, innumerable as the locusts,\r\nresistless as the pestilence, and what fire and sword have spared\r\nthey shall devour, and nothing shall be left of all the glory of\r\nChristendom but its name and the memory of its fall!\"\r\n\r\nNatas spoke his frightful prophecy like one entranced, and when he\r\nhad finished he let his head fall forward for a moment on his breast,\r\nas though he were exhausted. Then he raised it again, and went on in\r\na calmer voice--\r\n\r\n\"There is but one power under heaven that can stand between the\r\nWestern world and this destruction, and that is the race to which you\r\nbelong. It is the conquering race of earth, and the choicest fruit of\r\nall the ages until now. It is nearly two hundred million strong, and\r\nit is united by the ties of kindred blood and speech the wide world\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\"But it is also divided by petty jealousies, and mean commercial\r\ninterests. But for these the world might be an Anglo-Saxon planet.\r\nWould it not be a glorious task for you, who are the flower of this\r\nsplendid race, so to unite it that it should stand as a solid barrier\r\nof invincible manhood before which this impending flood of yellow\r\nbarbarism should dash itself to pieces like the cloud-waves against\r\nthe granite summits of the eternal hills?\"\r\n\r\n\"A glorious task, truly!\" exclaimed Tremayne, once more springing\r\nfrom his chair and beginning to pace the room again; \"but the man is\r\nnot yet born who could accomplish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are fifty men on earth at this moment who can accomplish it,\r\nand of them the two chief are Englishmen,--yourself and this Richard\r\nArnold, whose genius has given the Terrorists the command of the air.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Alan Tremayne! here is a destiny such as no man ever had\r\nbefore revealed to him. It is not for a man of your nation and\r\nlineage to shrink from it. You have reproached me for using you to\r\nunworthy ends, as you thought them, and with pulling down where I am\r\nnot able to build up again. Obey me still, this time of your own free\r\nwill and with your eyes open, and, as I have pulled down by your\r\nhand, so by it will I build up again, if the Master of Destiny shall\r\npermit me; and if not, then shall you achieve the task without me.\r\nNow give me your ears, for the words that I have to say are weighty\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\"No human power can stop the war that has now begun, nor can any\r\ncurtail it until it has run its appointed course. But we have at our\r\ncommand a power which, if skilfully applied at the right moment, will\r\nturn the tide of conflict in favour of Britain, and if at that moment\r\nthe Mother of Nations can gather her children about her in obedience\r\nto the call of common kindred, all shall be well, and the world shall\r\nbe hers.\r\n\r\n\"But before that is made possible she must pass through the fire, and\r\nbe purged of that corruption which is even now poisoning her blood\r\nand clouding her eyes in the presence of her enemies. The overweening\r\nlust of gold must be burnt out of her soul in the fiery crucible of\r\nwar, and she must learn to hold honour once more higher than wealth,\r\nand rich and poor and gentle and simple must be as one family, and\r\nnot as master and servant.\r\n\r\n\"East and west, north and south, wherever the English tongue is\r\nspoken, men must clasp hands and forget all other things save that\r\nthey are brothers of blood and speech, and that the world is theirs\r\nif they choose to take it. This is a work that cannot be done by any\r\nnation, but only by a whole race, which with millions of hands and a\r\nsingle heart devotes itself to achieve success or perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brave words, brave words!\" cried Tremayne, pausing in his walk in\r\nfront of the chair in which Natas sat; \"and if you could make me\r\nbelieve them true, I would follow you blindly to the end, no matter\r\nwhat the path might be. But I cannot believe them. I cannot think\r\nthat you or I and a few followers, even aided by Arnold and his\r\naërial fleet, could accomplish such a stupendous task as that. It is\r\ntoo great. It is superhuman! And yet it would be glorious even to\r\nfail worthily in such a task, even to fall fighting in such a Titanic\r\nconflict!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and stood silent and irresolute, as though appalled by the\r\nprospect with which he was confronted here at the parting of the\r\nways. He glanced at the extraordinary being sitting near him, and saw\r\nhis deep, dark eyes fixed upon him, as though they were reading his\r\nvery soul within him. Then he took a step towards the cripple's\r\nchair, took his right hand in his, and said slowly and steadily and\r\nsolemnly--\r\n\r\n\"It is a worthy destiny! I will essay it for good or evil, for life\r\nor death. I am with you to the end!\"\r\n\r\nAs Tremayne spoke the fatal words which once more bound him, and this\r\ntime for life and of his own free will, to Natas the Jew, this\r\ncripple who, chained to his chair, yet aspired to the throne of a\r\nworld, he fancied he saw his shapeless lips move in a smile, and into\r\nhis eyes there came a proud look of mingled joy and triumph as he\r\nreturned the handclasp, and said in a softer, kinder voice than\r\nTremayne had ever heard him use before--\r\n\r\n\"Well spoken! Those words were worthy of you and of your race! As\r\nyour faith is, so shall your reward be. Now wheel my chair to yonder\r\nwindow that looks out towards the east, and you shall look past the\r\nshadows into the day which is beyond. So! that will do. Now get\r\nanother chair and sit beside me. Fix your eyes on that bright star\r\nthat shows above the trees, and do not speak, but think only of that\r\nstar and its brightness.\"\r\n\r\nTremayne did as he was bidden in silence, and when he was seated\r\nNatas swept his hands gently downwards over his open eyes again and\r\nagain, till the lids grew heavy and fell, shutting out the brightness\r\nof the star, and the dim beauty of the landscape which lay sleeping\r\nin the twilight and the June night.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly it seemed as though they opened again of their own\r\naccord, and were endowed with an infinite power of vision. The trees\r\nand lawns of the home park of Alanmere and the dark rolling hills of\r\nheather beyond were gone, and in their place lay stretched out a\r\ncontinent which he saw as though from some enormous height, with its\r\nplains and lowlands and rivers, vast steppes and snowclad hills,\r\nforests and tablelands, huge mountain masses rearing lonely peaks of\r\neverlasting ice to a sunlight that had no heat; and then beyond these\r\nagain more plains and forests, that stretched away southward until\r\nthey merged in the all-surrounding sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"You have seen the Field of Armageddon.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 149._]\r\n\r\nThen he seemed to be carried forward towards the scene until he could\r\ndistinguish the smallest objects upon the earth, and he saw, swarming\r\nsouthward and westward, vast hordes of men, that divided into long\r\nstreams, and poured through mountain passes and defiles, and spread\r\nthemselves again over fertile lands, like locusts over green fields\r\nof young corn. And wherever those hordes swept forward, a long line\r\nof fire and smoke went in front of them, and where they had passed\r\nthe earth was a blackened wilderness.\r\n\r\nThen, too, from the coasts and islands vast fleets of war-ships put\r\nout, pouring their clouds of smoke to the sky, and making swiftly for\r\nthe southward and westward, where from other coasts and islands other\r\nvessels put out to meet them, and, meeting them, were lost with them\r\nunder great clouds of grey smoke, through which flashed incessantly\r\nlong livid tongues of flame.\r\n\r\nThen, like a panorama rolled away from him, the mighty picture\r\nreceded and new lands came into view, familiar lands which he had\r\ntraversed often. They too were black and wasted with the tempest of\r\nwar from east to west, but nevertheless those swarming streams came\r\non, countless and undiminished, up out of the south and east, while\r\non the western verge vast armies and fleets battled desperately with\r\neach other on sea and land, as though they heeded not those locust\r\nswarms of dusky millions coming ever nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nOnce more the scene rolled backwards, and he saw a mighty city\r\nclosely beleaguered by two vast hosts of men, who slowly pushed their\r\nbatteries forward until they planted them on all the surrounding\r\nheights, and poured a hail of shot and shell upon the swarming,\r\nhelpless millions that were crowded within the impassable ring of\r\nfire and smoke. Above the devoted city swam in mid-air strange shapes\r\nlike monstrous birds of prey, and beneath where they floated the\r\nearth seemed ever and anon to open and belch forth smoke and flame\r\ninto which the crumbling houses fell and burnt in heaps of shapeless\r\nruins. Then----\r\n\r\nHe felt a cool hand laid almost caressingly on his brow, and the\r\nvoice of Natas said beside him--\r\n\r\n\"That is enough. You have seen the Field of Armageddon, and when the\r\nday of battle comes you shall be there and play the part allotted to\r\nyou from the beginning. Do you believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Tremayne, rising wearily from his chair, \"I believe;\r\nand as the task is, so may Heaven make my strength in the stress of\r\nbattle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" said Natas very solemnly.\r\n\r\nThat night the young Lord of Alanmere went sleepless to bed, and lay\r\nawake till dawn, revolving over and over again in his mind the\r\nmarvellous things that he had seen and heard, and the tremendous task\r\nto which he had now irrevocably committed himself for good or evil.\r\nIn all these waking dreams there was ever present before his mental\r\nvision the face of a woman whose beauty was like and yet unlike that\r\nof the daughter of Natas. It lacked the brilliance and subtle charm\r\nwhich in Natasha so wondrously blended the dusky beauty of the\r\ndaughters of the South with the fairer loveliness of the daughters of\r\nthe North; but it atoned for this by that softer grace and sweetness\r\nwhich is the highest charm of purely English beauty.\r\n\r\nIt was the face of the woman whom, in that portion of his strange\r\ndouble life which had been free from the mysterious influence of\r\nNatas, he had loved with well-assured hope that she would one day\r\nrule his house and broad domains with him. She was now Lady Muriel\r\nPenarth, the daughter of Lord Marazion, a Cornish nobleman, whose\r\nestates abutted on those which belonged to Lord Alanmere as Baron\r\nTremayne, of Tremayne, in the county of Cornwall, as the _Peerage_\r\nhad it. Noble alike by lineage and nature, no fairer mistress could\r\nhave been found for the lands of Tremayne and Alanmere, but--what\r\nseas of blood and flame now lay between him and the realisation of\r\nhis love-ideal!\r\n\r\nHe must forsake his own, and become a revolutionary and an outcast\r\nfrom Society. He must draw the sword upon the world and his own race,\r\nand, armed with the most awful means of destruction that the wit of\r\nman had ever devised, he must fight his way through universal war to\r\nthat peace which alone he could ask her to share with him. Still much\r\ncould be done before he took the final step of severance which might\r\nbe perpetual, and he would lose no time in doing it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was fairly light, he rose and took a long, rapid walk\r\nover the home park, and when he returned to breakfast at nine he had\r\nresolved to execute forthwith a deed of gift, transferring the whole\r\nof his vast property, which was unentailed and therefore entirely at\r\nhis own disposal, to the woman who was to have shared it with him in\r\na few months as his wife. If the Fates were kind, he would come back\r\nfrom the world-war and reclaim both the lands and their mistress, and\r\nif not he would have the satisfaction of knowing that his broad acres\r\nat least had a worthy mistress.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast he met Natas again, and during the meal one of his\r\nfootmen entered, bringing the letters that had come by the morning\r\npost.\r\n\r\nThere were several letters for each of them, those for Natas being\r\naddressed to \"Herr F. Niemand,\" and for some time they were both\r\nemployed in looking through their correspondence. Suddenly Natas\r\nlooked up, and said--\r\n\r\n\"When do you expect to hear that Arnold is off the south coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost any day now; in fact, within the week, if everything has gone\r\nright. Here is a letter from Johnston to say that the _Lurline_ has\r\narrived at Plymouth, and that a bright look-out is being kept for\r\nhim. He will telegraph here and to the club in London as soon as the\r\nair-ship is sighted. Twenty-four hours will then see us on board the\r\n_Ariel_, or whichever of the ships he comes in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope the news will come soon, for Michael Roburoff, the\r\nPresident's brother, who has been in command of the American Section,\r\ncables to say that he sails from New York the day after to-morrow\r\nwith detailed accounts. That means that he will come with full\r\nreports of what the Section has done and will be ready to do when the\r\ntime comes, and also what the enemy are doing.\r\n\r\n\"He sails in the _Aurania_, and as the Atlantic routes are swarming\r\nwith war-ships and torpedo-boats, she will probably have to run the\r\ngauntlet, and it is of the last importance that Michael and his\r\nreports reach us safely. It will therefore be necessary for the\r\nair-ship to meet the _Aurania_ as soon as possible on her passage,\r\nand take him off her before any harm happens to him. If he and his\r\nreports fell into the hands of the enemy, there is no telling what\r\nmight happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"As nearly as I can calculate,\" said Tremayne, \"the air-ship should\r\nbe sighted in three days from now, perhaps in two. It will take the\r\n_Aurania_ over four days to cross the Atlantic, and so we ought to be\r\nable to meet her somewhere in mid-ocean if she is able to get so far\r\nwithout being overhauled. Unfortunately she is known to be a British\r\nship and subsidised by the British Government, so there will be very\r\nlittle chance of her getting through under the American flag. Still\r\nshe's about the fastest steamer afloat, and will take a lot of\r\ncatching.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if the worst comes and she falls into the hands of the enemy, we\r\nmust fight our first naval battle and retake her, even if we have to\r\nsink a few cruisers to do so,\" added Natas; \"for, come what may,\r\nMichael must not be captured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arnold will almost certainly come in his flagship, and if she is\r\nwhat he promised, she should be more than a match for a whole fleet,\r\nso I don't think there is much to fear unless the _Aurania_ gets sunk\r\nbefore we reach her,\" said Tremayne.\r\n\r\nNatas and his host devoted the rest of the forenoon to their\r\ncorrespondence, and to making the final arrangements for leaving\r\nAlanmere. Tremayne wrote full instructions to his lawyers for the\r\ndrawing up of the deed, and directed them to have it ready for his\r\nsignature by two o'clock on the following day. After lunch he rode\r\nover to Knaresborough himself with the post-bag, telegraphed an\r\nabstract of his instructions in advance, and ordered his private\r\nsaloon carriage to be attached to the up express which passed through\r\nat eight the next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nJUST IN TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the train drew up in King's Cross station at twelve the next day,\r\nalmost the first words that Tremayne heard were--\r\n\r\n\"Special _Pall Mall_, sir! Appearance of the mysterious air-ship over\r\nPlymouth this morning! Great battle in Austria yesterday, defeat of\r\nthe Austrians--awful slaughter with war-balloons! Special!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was selling the papers as fast as he could hand them out to\r\nthe eager passengers. Tremayne secured one, shut the door of the\r\nsaloon again, and, turning to the middle page, read aloud to Natas--\r\n\r\n\"We have just received a telegram from our Plymouth correspondent, to\r\nsay that soon after daybreak this morning torpedo-boat No. 157\r\nsteamed into the Sound, bringing the news that she had sighted a\r\nlarge five-masted air-ship about ten miles from the coast, when in\r\ncompany with the cruiser _Ariadne_, whose commander had despatched\r\nher with the news. Hardly had the report been received when the\r\nair-ship herself passed over Mount Edgcumbe and came towards the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\"The news spread like wildfire, and in a few minutes the streets were\r\nfilled with crowds of people, who had thrown on a few clothes and\r\nrushed out to get a look at the strange visitant. At first it was\r\nthought that an attack on the arsenal was intended by the mysterious\r\nvessel, and the excitement had risen almost to the pitch of panic,\r\nwhen it was observed that she was flying a plain white flag, and that\r\nher intentions were apparently peaceful.\r\n\r\n\"Panic then gave place to curiosity. The air-ship crossed the town at\r\nan elevation of about 3000 feet, described a complete circle round it\r\nin the space of a few minutes, and then suddenly shot up into the air\r\nand vanished to the south-westward at an inconceivable speed. The\r\nvessel is described as being about a hundred feet long, and was\r\napparently armed with eight guns. Her hull was of white polished\r\nmetal, probably aluminium, and shone like silver in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n\"The wildest rumours are current as to the object of her visit, but\r\nof course no credence can be attached to any of them. The vessel is\r\nplainly of the same type as that which destroyed Kronstadt two months\r\nago, but larger and more powerful. The inference is that she is one\r\nof a fleet in the hands of the Terrorists, and the profoundest\r\nuncertainty and anxiety prevail throughout naval and military circles\r\neverywhere as to the use that they may make of these appalling means\r\nof destruction should they take any share in the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Tremayne, as he finished reading. \"Johnston's telegram\r\nmust have crossed us on the way, but I shall find one at the club.\r\nWell, we have no time to lose, for we ought to start for Plymouth\r\nthis evening. Your men will take you straight to the Great Western\r\nHotel, and I will hurry my business through as fast as possible, and\r\nmeet you there in time to catch the 6.30. At this rate we shall meet\r\nthe _Aurania_ soon after she leaves New York.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the next six hours Tremayne transferred the whole of his vast\r\nproperty in a single instrument to his promised wife, thus making her\r\nthe richest woman in England; handed the precious deeds to her\r\nastonished father; obtained his promise to take his wife and daughter\r\nto Alanmere at the end of the London season, and to remain there with\r\nher until he returned to reclaim her and his estates together; and\r\nsaid good-bye to Lady Muriel herself in an interview which was a good\r\ndeal longer than that which he had with his bewildered and somewhat\r\nscandalised lawyers, who had never before been forced to rush any\r\ntransaction through at such an indecent speed. Had Lord Alanmere not\r\nbeen the best client in the kingdom, they might have rebelled against\r\nsuch an outrage on the law's time-honoured delays; but he was not a\r\nman to be trifled with, and so the work was done and an unbeatable\r\nrecord in legal despatch accomplished, albeit very unwillingly, by\r\nthe men of law.\r\n\r\nBy midnight the _Lurline_, ostensibly bound for Queenstown, had\r\ncleared the Sound, and, with the Eddystone Light on her port bow,\r\nheaded away at full-speed to the westward. She was about the fastest\r\nyacht afloat, and at a pinch could be driven a good twenty-seven\r\nmiles an hour through the water. As both Natas and Tremayne were\r\nanxious to join the air-ship as soon as possible, every ounce of\r\nsteam that her boilers would stand was put on, and she slipped along\r\nin splendid style through the long, dark seas that came rolling\r\nsmoothly up Channel from the westward.\r\n\r\nIn an hour and a half after passing the Eddystone she sighted the\r\nLizard Light, and by the time she had brought it well abeam the first\r\ninterruption of her voyage occurred. A huge, dark mass loomed\r\nsuddenly up out of the darkness of the moonless night, then a\r\nblinding, dazzling ray of light shot across the water from the\r\nsearchlight of a battleship that was patrolling the coast, attended\r\nby a couple of cruisers and four torpedo-boats. One of these last\r\ncame flying towards the yacht down the white path of the beam of\r\nlight, and Tremayne, seeing that he would have to give an account of\r\nhimself, stopped his engines and waited for the torpedo-boat to come\r\nwithin hail.\r\n\r\n\"Steamer ahoy! Who are you? and where are you going to at that\r\nspeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the _Lurline_, the Earl of Alanmere's yacht, from Plymouth\r\nto Queenstown. We're only going at our usual speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if it's the _Lurline_, you needn't say that,\" answered the\r\nofficer who had hailed from the torpedo-boat, with a laugh. \"Is Lord\r\nAlanmere on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here I am,\" said Tremayne, replying instead of his\r\nsailing-master. \"Is that you, Selwyn? I thought I recognised your\r\nvoice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's I, or rather all that's left of me after two months in\r\nthis buck-jumping little brute of a craft. She bobs twice in the same\r\nhole every time, and if it's a fairly deep hole she just dives right\r\nthrough and out on the other side; and there are such a lot of\r\nFrenchmen about that we get no rest day or night on this patrolling\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very sorry for you, old man; but if you will seek glory in a\r\ntorpedo-boat, I don't see that you can expect anything else. Will you\r\ncome on board and have a drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks. Very sorry, but I can't stop. By the way, have you heard\r\nof that air-ship that was over this way this morning? I wonder what\r\nthe deuce it really is, and what it's up to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard of it; it was in the London papers this morning. Have you\r\nseen any more of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; the thing was cruising about in mid-air all this morning,\r\ntaking stock of us and the Frenchmen too, I suppose. She vanished\r\nduring the afternoon. Where to, I don't know. It's awfully\r\nhumiliating, you know, to be obliged to crawl about here on the\r\nwater, at twenty-five knots at the utmost, while that fellow is\r\nflying a hundred miles an hour or so through the clouds without\r\nturning a hair, or I ought to say without as much as a puff of smoke.\r\nHe seems to move of his own mere volition. I wonder what on earth he\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much on earth apparently, but something very considerable in the\r\nair, where I hope he'll stop out of sight until I get to Queenstown;\r\nand as I want to get there pretty early in the morning, perhaps\r\nyou'll excuse me saying good-night and getting along, if you won't\r\ncome on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, very sorry I can't. Good-night, and keep well in to the coast\r\ntill you have to cross to Ireland. Good-bye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye!\" shouted Tremayne in reply, as the torpedo-boat swung\r\nround and headed back to the battleship, and he gave the order to go\r\nahead again at full-speed.\r\n\r\nIn another hour they were off the Land's End, and from there they\r\nheaded out due south-west into the Atlantic. They had hardly made\r\nanother hundred miles before it began to grow light, and then it\r\nbecame necessary to keep a bright look-out for the air-ship, for\r\naccording to what they had heard from the commander of the\r\ntorpedo-boat she might be sighted at any moment as soon as it was\r\nlight enough to see her.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed, but there was still no sign of the air-ship.\r\nThis of course was to be expected, for they had still another\r\nseventy-five miles or so to go before the rendezvous was reached.\r\n\r\n\"Steamer to the south'ard!\" sang out the man on the forecastle, just\r\nas Tremayne came on deck after an attempt at a brief nap. He picked\r\nup his glass, and took a good look at the thin cloud of smoke away on\r\nthe southern horizon.\r\n\r\nFrom what he could see it was a large steamer, and was coming up very\r\nfast, almost at right angles to the course of the _Lurline_. Fifteen\r\nminutes later he was able to see that the stranger was a warship, and\r\nthat she was heading for Queenstown. She was therefore either a\r\nBritish ship attached to the Irish Squadron, or else she was an enemy\r\nwith designs on the liners bound for Liverpool.\r\n\r\nIn either case it was most undesirable that the yacht should be\r\noverhauled again. Any mishap to her, even a lengthy delay, might have\r\nthe most serious consequences. A single unlucky shell exploding in\r\nher engine-room would disable her, and perhaps change the future\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nTremayne therefore altered her course a little more to the northward,\r\nthus increasing the distance between her and the stranger, and at the\r\nsame time ordered the engineer to keep up the utmost head of steam,\r\nand get the last possible yard out of her.\r\n\r\nThe alteration in her course appeared to be instantly detected by the\r\nwarship, for she at once swerved off more to the westward, and\r\nbrought herself dead astern of the _Lurline_. She was now near enough\r\nfor Tremayne to see that she was a large cruiser, and attended by a\r\nbrace of torpedo-boats, which were running along one under each of\r\nher quarters, like a couple of dogs following a hunter.\r\n\r\nThere was now no doubt but that, whatever her nationality, she was\r\nbent on overhauling the yacht, if possible, and the dense volumes of\r\nsmoke that were pouring out of her funnels told Tremayne that she was\r\nstoking up vigorously for the chase.\r\n\r\nBy this time she was about seven miles away, and the _Lurline_, her\r\ntwin screws beating the water at their utmost speed, and every plate\r\nin her trembling under the vibration of her engines, rushed through\r\nthe water faster than she had ever done since the day she was\r\nlaunched. As far as could be seen, she was holding her own well in\r\nwhat had now become a dead-on stern chase.\r\n\r\nStill the stranger showed no flag, and though Tremayne could hardly\r\nbelieve that a hostile cruiser and a couple of torpedo-boats would\r\nventure so near to the ground occupied by the British battle-ships,\r\nthe fact that she showed no colours looked at the best suspicious.\r\nDetermined to settle the question, if possible, one way or the other,\r\nhe ran up the ensign of the Royal Yacht Squadron.\r\n\r\nThis brought no reply from the cruiser, but a column of bluish-white\r\nsmoke shot up a moment later from the funnels of one of the\r\ntorpedo-boats, telling that she had put on the forced draught, and,\r\nlike a greyhound slipped from the leash, she began to draw away from\r\nthe big ship, plunging through the long rollers, and half-burying\r\nherself in the foam that she threw up from her bows.\r\n\r\nTremayne knew that there were some of these viperish little craft in\r\nthe French navy that could be driven thirty miles an hour through the\r\nwater, and if this was one of them, capture was only a matter of\r\ntime, unless the air-ship sighted them and came to the rescue.\r\n\r\nHappily, although there was a considerable swell on, the water was\r\nsmooth and free from short waves, and this was to the advantage of\r\nthe _Lurline_; for she went along \"as dry as a bone,\" while the\r\ntorpedo-boat, lying much lower in the water, rammed her nose into\r\nevery roller, and so lost a certain amount of way. The yacht was\r\nmaking a good twenty-eight miles an hour under the heroic efforts of\r\nthe engineers; and at this rate it would be nearly two hours before\r\nshe was overhauled, provided that the torpedo-boat was not able to\r\nuse the gun that she carried forward of her funnels with any\r\ndangerous effect.\r\n\r\nThere could now be no doubt as to the hostility of the pursuers. Had\r\nthey been British, they would have answered the flag flying at the\r\npeak of the yacht.\r\n\r\n\"Steamer coming down from the nor'ard, sir!\" suddenly sang out a man\r\nwhom Tremayne had just stationed in the fore cross-trees to look out\r\nfor the air-ship that was now so anxiously expected.\r\n\r\nA dense volume of smoke was seen rising in the direction indicated,\r\nand a few minutes later a second big steamer came into view, bearing\r\ndown directly on the yacht, and so approaching the torpedo-boat\r\nalmost stem on. There was no doubt about her nationality. A glance\r\nthrough the glass showed Tremayne the white ensign floating above the\r\nhorizontal stream of smoke that stretched behind her. She was a\r\nBritish cruiser, no doubt a scout of the Irish Squadron, and had\r\nsighted the smoke of the yacht and her pursuers, and had come to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nTremayne breathed more freely now, for he knew that his flag would\r\nprocure the assistance of the new-comer in case it was wanted, as\r\nindeed it very soon was.\r\n\r\nHardly had the British cruiser come well in sight than a puff of\r\nsmoke rose from the deck of the other warship, and a shell came\r\nwhistling through the air, and burst within a hundred yards of the\r\n_Lurline_. Twenty-four hours ago Tremayne had been one of the richest\r\nmen in England, and just now he would have willingly given all that\r\nhe had possessed to be twenty-five miles further to the\r\nsouth-westward than he was.\r\n\r\nAnother shell from the Frenchman passed clear over the _Lurline_, and\r\nplunged into the water and burst, throwing a cloud of spray high into\r\nthe air. Then came one from the torpedo-boat, but she was still too\r\nfar off for her light gun to do any damage, and the projectile fell\r\nspent into the sea nearly five hundred yards short.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this came a third shell from the French cruiser,\r\nand this, by an unlucky chance, struck the forecastle of the yacht,\r\nburst, and tore away several feet of the bulwarks, and, worse than\r\nall, killed four of her crew instantly.\r\n\r\n\"First blood!\" said Tremayne to himself through his clenched teeth.\r\n\"That shall be an unlucky shot for you, my friend, if we reach the\r\nair-ship before you sink us.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two cruisers, each approaching the other at a speed of\r\nmore than twenty miles an hour, had got within shot. A puff of smoke\r\nspurted out from the side of the latest comer. The well-aimed\r\nprojectile passed fifty yards astern of the _Lurline_, and struck the\r\nadvancing torpedo-boat square on the bow.\r\n\r\nThe next instant it was plainly apparent that there was nothing more\r\nto be feared from her. The solid shot had passed clean through her\r\ntwo sides. Her nose went down and her stern came up. Then bang went\r\nanother gun from the British cruiser. This time the messenger of\r\ndeath was a shell. It struck the inclined deck amidships, there was a\r\nflash of flame, a cloud of steam rose up from her bursting boilers,\r\nand then she broke in two and vanished beneath the smooth-rolling\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later the duel began in deadly earnest. The tricolor ran\r\nup to the masthead of the French cruiser, and jets of mingled smoke\r\nand flame spurted one after the other from her sides, and shells\r\nbegan bursting in quick succession round the rapidly-advancing\r\nEnglishman. Evidently the Frenchman, with his remaining torpedo-boat,\r\nthought himself a good match for the British cruiser, for he showed\r\nno disposition to shirk the combat, despite the fact that he was so\r\nnear to the cruising ground of a powerful squadron.\r\n\r\nAs the two cruisers approached each other, the fire from their heavy\r\nguns was supplemented by that of their light quick-firing armament,\r\nuntil each of them became a floating volcano, vomiting continuous\r\njets of smoke and flame, and hurling showers of shot and shell across\r\nthe rapidly-lessening space between them.\r\n\r\nThe din of the hideous concert became little short of appalling, even\r\nto the most hardened nerves. The continuous deep booming of the heavy\r\nguns, as they belched forth their three-hundred-pound projectiles,\r\nmingled with the sharp ringing reports of the thirty and forty pound\r\nquick-firers, and the horrible grinding rattle of the machine guns in\r\nthe tops that sounded clearly above all, and every few seconds came\r\nthe scream and the bang of bursting shells, and the dull, crashing\r\nsound of rending and breaking steel, as the terrible missiles of\r\ndeath and destruction found their destined mark.\r\n\r\nHappily the _Lurline_ was out of the line of fire, or she would have\r\nbeen torn to fragments and sent to the bottom in a few seconds. She\r\ncontinued on her course at her utmost speed, and the French cruiser\r\nwas, of course, too busy to pay any further attention to her. Not so\r\nthe remaining torpedo-boat, however, which, leaving the two big ships\r\nto fight out their duel for the present, was pursuing the yacht at\r\nthe utmost speed of her forced draught.\r\n\r\nCapture or destruction soon only became a matter of a few minutes.\r\nTremayne, determined to hold on till he was sunk or sighted the\r\nair-ship, kept his flag flying and his engines working to the last\r\nounce that the quivering boilers would stand, and the Frenchman,\r\nseeing that he was determined to escape if he could, opened fire on\r\nhim with his twenty-pounder.\r\n\r\nOwing to the high speed of the two vessels, and the rolling of the\r\ntorpedo-boat, not much execution was done at first; but, as the\r\ndistance diminished, shell after shell crashed through the bulwarks\r\nof the _Lurline_, ripping them longitudinally, and tearing up the\r\ndeck-planks with their jagged fragments. The wheel-house and the\r\nfunnel escaped by a miracle, and the yacht being end on to her\r\npursuer, the engines and boilers were comparatively safe.\r\n\r\nOne boat had also escaped, and that was hanging ready to be lowered\r\nat a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nAt last a shell struck the funnel, burst, and shattered it to\r\nfragments. Almost at the same moment the man in the fore-cross-trees,\r\nwho had stuck to his post in defiance of the cannonade, sang out with\r\na triumphant shout--\r\n\r\n\"The air-ship! The air-ship!\"\r\n\r\nHardly had the words left his lips when a shell from the torpedo-boat\r\nstruck the _Lurline_ under the quarter, and ripped one of her plates\r\nout like a sheet of paper. The next instant the engineer rushed up on\r\ndeck, crying--\r\n\r\n\"The bottom's out of her! She'll go down in five minutes!\"\r\n\r\nTremayne, who was the only man on deck save the look-out, ran out of\r\nthe wheel-house, dived into the cabin, and a moment later reappeared\r\nwith Natas in his arms, and followed by his two attendants. Then,\r\nwithout the loss of a second, but in perfect order, the quarter-boat\r\nwas manned and lowered, and pulled clear of the ill-fated _Lurline_\r\njust as she pitched backwards into the sea and went down with a run,\r\nstern foremost.\r\n\r\nThe air-ship, coming up at a tremendous speed, swooped suddenly down\r\nfrom a height of two thousand feet, and slowed up within a thousand\r\nyards of the torpedo-boat. A projectile rushed through the air and\r\nlanded on the deck of the Frenchman. There was a flash of greenish\r\nflame, a cloud of mingled smoke and steam, and when this had drifted\r\naway there was not a vestige of the torpedo-boat to be seen. Then a\r\nfew fragments of iron splashed into the water here and there, and\r\nthat was all that betokened her fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nARMED NEUTRALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly had the _Lurline_ disappeared than the air-ship was lying\r\nalongside the boat, floating on the water as easily and lightly as a\r\nseagull, and Natas and his two attendants, Tremayne, and the three\r\nmen who had been saved from the yacht, were at once taken on board.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to interrupt the progress of the narrative to\r\ndescribe the welcoming greetings which passed between the rescued\r\nparty and the crew of the _Ithuriel_, or the amazement of Arnold and\r\nhis companions when Natasha threw her arms round the neck of the\r\nalmost helpless cripple, who was rifted over the rail by Tremayne and\r\nhis two attendants, kissed him on the brow, and said so that all\r\ncould hear her--\r\n\r\n\"We were in time! Thank God we were in time, my father!\"\r\n\r\nHer father! This paralytic creature, who could not move a yard\r\nwithout the assistance of some one else--this was Natas, the father\r\nof Natasha, and the Master of the Terror, the man who had planned the\r\nruin of a civilisation, and for all they knew might aspire to the\r\nempire of the world!\r\n\r\nIt was marvellous, inconceivable, but there was no time to think\r\nabout it now, for the two cruisers were still blazing away at each\r\nother, and Tremayne had determined to punish the Frenchman for his\r\ndiscourtesy in not answering his flag, and his inhumanity in firing\r\non an unarmed vessel which was well known as a private pleasure-yacht\r\nall round the western and southern shores of Europe.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Natas had been conveyed into the saloon, Tremayne, after\r\nreturning Arnold's hearty handclasp, said to him--\r\n\r\n\"That rascally Frenchman chased and fired on us, and then sent his\r\ntorpedo-boat after us, without the slightest provocation. I purposely\r\nhoisted the Yacht Squadron flag to show that we were non-combatants,\r\nand still he sank us. I suppose he took the _Lurline_ for a fast\r\ndespatch boat, but still he ought to have had the sense and the\r\npoliteness to let her alone when he saw she was a yacht, so I want\r\nyou to teach him better manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replies Arnold. \"I'll sink him for you in five seconds\r\nas soon as we get aloft again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want you to do that if you can help it. She has five or six\r\nhundred men on board, who are only doing as they are told, and we\r\nhave not declared war on the world yet. Can't you disable her, and\r\nforce her to surrender to the British cruiser that came to our\r\nrescue? You know we must have been sunk or captured half an hour ago\r\nif she had not turned up so opportunely, in spite of your so happily\r\ncoming fifty miles this side of the rendezvous. I should like to\r\nreturn the compliment by delivering his enemy into his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite see what you mean, but I'm afraid I can't guarantee success.\r\nYou see, our artillery is intended for destruction, and not for\r\ndisablement. Still I'll have a try with pleasure. I'll see if I can't\r\ndisable his screws, only you mustn't blame me if he goes to the\r\nbottom by accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, you most capable destroyer of life and property,\"\r\nlaughed Tremayne. \"Only let him off as lightly as you can. Ah,\r\nNatasha! Good morning again! I suppose Natas has taken no harm from\r\nthe unceremonious way in which I had to almost throw him on board the\r\nboat. Aërial voyaging seems to agree with you, you\"--\r\n\r\n\"Must not talk nonsense, my Lord of Alanmere, especially when there\r\nis sterner work in hand,\" interrupted Natasha, with a laugh. \"What\r\nare you going to do with those two cruisers that are battering each\r\nother to pieces down there? Sink them both, or leave them to fight it\r\nout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither, with your permission, fair lady. The British cruiser saved\r\nus by coming on the scene at the right moment, and as the Frenchman\r\nfired upon us without due cause, I want Captain Arnold to disable her\r\nin some way and hand her over a prisoner to our rescuer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that would be better, of course. One good turn deserves another.\r\nWhat are you going to do, Captain Arnold?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drop a small shell under his stern and disable his propellers, if I\r\ncan do so without sinking him, which I am afraid is rather doubtful,\"\r\nreplied Arnold.\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking, the _Ithuriel_ had risen a thousand feet or\r\nso from the water, and had advanced to within about half a mile of\r\nthe two cruisers, which were now manoeuvring round each other at a\r\ndistance of about a thousand yards, blazing away without cessation,\r\nand waiting for some lucky shot to partially disable one or the\r\nother, and so give an opportunity for boarding, or ramming.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when France and Britain had last grappled in the\r\nstruggle for the mastery of the sea, the two ships would have been\r\nlaid alongside each other long before this. But that was not to be\r\nthought of while those terrible machine guns were able to rain their\r\nhail of death down from the tops, and the quick-firing cannon were\r\nhurling their thirty shots a minute across the intervening space of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe French cruiser had so far taken no notice of the sudden\r\nannihilation of her second torpedo-boat by the air-ship, but as soon\r\nas the latter made her way astern of her she seemed to scent\r\nmischief, and turned one of her three-barrelled Nordenfeldts on to\r\nher. The shots soon came singing about the _Ithuriel_ in somewhat\r\nunpleasant proximity, and Arnold said--\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur seems to take us for a natural enemy, and if he wants fight\r\nhe shall have it. If I don't disable him with this shot I'll sink him\r\nwith the next.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying he trained one of the broadside guns on the stern of the\r\nFrench cruiser, and at the right moment pressed the button. The shell\r\nbored its way through the air and down into the water until it struck\r\nand exploded against the submerged rudder.\r\n\r\nA huge column of foam rose up under the cruiser's stern; half lifted\r\nout of the water, she plunged forward with a mighty lurch, burying\r\nher forecastle in the green water, and then she righted and lay\r\nhelpless upon the sea, deprived of the power of motion and steering,\r\nand with the useless steam roaring in great clouds from her pipes. A\r\nmoment later she began to settle by the stern, showing that her after\r\nplates had been badly injured, if not torn away by the explosion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Ithuriel_ had shot away out of range until the two\r\ncruisers looked like little toy-ships spitting fire at each other,\r\nand Arnold said to Tremayne, who was with him in the wheel-house--\r\n\r\n\"I think that has settled her, as far as any more real fighting is\r\nconcerned. Look! She can't stand that sort of thing very long.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed Tremayne the glasses as he spoke. The French cruiser was\r\nlying motionless upon the water, with her after compartments full,\r\nand very much down by the stern. She was still blazing away gamely\r\nwith all her available guns, but it was obvious at a glance that she\r\nwas now no match for her antagonist, who had taken full advantage of\r\nthe help rendered by her unknown ally, and was pouring a perfect hail\r\nof shot and shell point-blank into her half-disabled adversary,\r\nbattering her deck-works into ruins, and piercing her hull again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the splendid fabric had been reduced to little better\r\nthan a floating wreck by the terrible cannonade, the fire from the\r\nBritish cruiser stopped, and the signal \"Will you surrender?\" flew\r\nfrom her masthead.\r\n\r\nA few moments later the tricolor, for the first time in the war,\r\ndipped to the White Ensign, and the naval duel was over.\r\n\r\n\"Now we will leave them to talk it over,\" said Tremayne, shutting the\r\nglasses. \"I should like to hear what they have to say about us, I\r\nmust confess, but there is something more important to be done, and\r\nthe sooner we are on the other side of the Atlantic the better. The\r\n_Aurania_ started from New York this morning. How soon can you get\r\nacross?\"\r\n\r\n\"In about sixteen hours if we had to go all the way,\" replied Arnold.\r\n\"It is, say, three thousand miles from here to New York, and the\r\n_Ithuriel_ can fly two hundred miles an hour if necessary. But the\r\n_Aurania_, if she starts in good time, will make between four and\r\nfive hundred miles during the day, and so we ought to meet her soon\r\nafter sundown this evening if we are lucky.\"\r\n\r\nAs Arnold ceased speaking, the report of a single gun came up from\r\nthe water, and a string of signal flags floated out from the masthead\r\nof the British cruiser.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" said Tremayne, once more turning the glasses on the two\r\nvessels, \"that was a blank cartridge, and as far as I can make out\r\nthat signal reads, 'We want to speak you.' And look: there goes a\r\nwhite flag to the fore. His intentions are evidently peaceful. What\r\ndo you say, shall we go down?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no objection to it. It will only make a difference of half an\r\nhour or so, and perhaps we may learn something worth knowing from the\r\ncaptain about the naval force afloat in the Atlantic. I think it\r\nwould be worth while. We have no need for concealment now; and\r\nbesides, all Europe is talking about us, so there can be no harm in\r\nshowing ourselves a bit more closely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, we will go down and hear what he has to say,\"\r\nreplied Tremayne. \"But I don't think it would be well for me to show\r\nmyself just now, and so I will go below.\"\r\n\r\nArnold at once signalled the necessary order from the conning tower\r\nto the engine-room. The fan-wheels revolved more slowly, and the\r\n_Ithuriel_ sank swiftly downwards towards the two cruisers, now lying\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she came to a standstill within speaking distance of the\r\nBritish man-of-war, discipline was for the moment forgotten on board\r\nof both victor and vanquished, under the influence of the intense\r\nexcitement and curiosity aroused by seeing the mysterious and\r\nmuch-talked-of air-ship at such close quarters.\r\n\r\nThe French and British captains were both standing on the\r\nquarter-deck eagerly scanning the strange craft through their glasses\r\ntill she came near enough to dispense with them, and every man and\r\nofficer on board the two cruisers who was able to be on deck, crowded\r\nto points of 'vantage, and stared at her with all their eyes. The\r\nwhole company of the _Ithuriel_, with the exception of Natas,\r\nTremayne, and those whose duties kept them in the engine-room, were\r\nalso on deck, and Arnold stood close by the wheel-house and the after\r\ngun, ready to give any orders that might be necessary in case the\r\nconversation took an unfriendly turn.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask the name of that wonderful craft, and to what I am\r\nindebted for the assistance you have given me?\" hailed the British\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. This is the Terrorist air-ship _Ithuriel_, and we\r\ndisabled the French cruiser because her captain had the bad manners\r\nto fire upon and sink an unarmed yacht that had no quarrel with him.\r\nBut for that we should have left you to fight it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Terrorists, are you? If I had known that, I confess I should not\r\nhave asked to speak you, and I tell you candidly that I am sorry you\r\ndid not leave us to fight it out, as you say. As I cannot look upon\r\nyou as an ally or a friend, I can only regret the advantage you have\r\ngiven me over an honourable foe.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an emphasis on the word \"honourable\" which brought a flush\r\nto Arnold's cheek, as he replied--\r\n\r\n\"What I did to the French cruiser I should have done whether you had\r\nbeen on the scene or not. We are as much your foes as we are those of\r\nFrance, that is to say, we are totally indifferent to both of you. As\r\nfor _honourable_ foes, I may say that I only disabled the French\r\ncruiser because I thought she had acted both unfairly and\r\ndishonourably. But we are wasting time. Did you merely wish to speak\r\nto us in order to find out who we were?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was my first object, I confess. I also wished to know\r\nwhether this is the same air-ship which crossed the Mediterranean\r\nyesterday, and if not, how many of these vessels there are in\r\nexistence, and what you mean to do with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before I answer, may I ask how you know that an air-ship crossed the\r\nMediterranean yesterday?\" asked Arnold, thoroughly mystified by this\r\nastounding piece of news.\r\n\r\n\"We had it by telegraph at Queenstown during the night. She was going\r\nnorthward, when observed, by Larnaka\"--\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, that was one of our despatch boats,\" replied Arnold, forcing\r\nhimself to speak with a calmness that he by no means felt. \"I'm\r\nafraid my orders will hardly allow me to answer your other questions\r\nvery fully, but I may tell you that we have a fleet of air-ships at\r\nour command, all constructed in England under the noses of your\r\nintelligent authorities, and that we mean to use them as it seems\r\nbest to us, should we at any time consider it worth our while to\r\ninterfere in the game that the European Powers are playing with each\r\nother. Meanwhile we keep a position of armed neutrality. When we\r\nthink the war has gone far enough we shall probably stop it when a\r\ngood opportunity offers.\"\r\n\r\nThis was too much for a British sailor to listen to quietly on his\r\nown quarter-deck, whoever said it, and so the captain of the\r\n_Andromeda_ forgot his prudence for the moment, and said somewhat\r\nhotly--\r\n\r\n\"Confound it, sir! you talk as if you were omnipotent and arbiters of\r\npeace and war. Don't go too far with your insolence, or I shall haul\r\nthat flag of truce down and give you five minutes to get out of range\r\nof my guns or take your chance\"--\r\n\r\nFor all answer there came a contemptuous laugh from the deck of the\r\n_Ithuriel_, the rapid ringing of an electric bell, and the\r\ndisappearance of her company under cover. Then with one mighty leap\r\nshe rose two thousand feet into the air, and before the astounded and\r\ndisgusted captain of H.M. cruiser _Andromeda_ very well knew what had\r\nbecome of her, she was a mere speck of light in the sky, speeding\r\naway at two hundred miles an hour to the westward.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was fairly on her course, Arnold gave up the wheel to\r\none of the crew, and went into the saloon to discuss with Tremayne\r\nand Natas the all-important scrap of news that had fallen from the\r\nlips of the captain of the British cruiser. What was the other\r\nair-ship that had been seen crossing the Mediterranean?\r\n\r\nSurely it must be one of the Terrorist fleet, for there were no\r\nothers in existence. And yet strict orders had been given that none\r\nof the fleet were to take the air until the _Ithuriel_ returned. Was\r\nit possible that there were traitors, even in Aeria, and that the\r\nair-ship seen from Larnaka was a deserter going northward to the\r\nenemy, the worst enemy of all, the Russians?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nA BATTLE IN THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past five on the morning of the 23rd of June, the Cunard\r\nliner _Aurania_ left New York for Queenstown and Liverpool. She was\r\nthe largest and swiftest passenger steamer afloat, and on her maiden\r\nvoyage she had lowered the Atlantic record by no less than twelve\r\nhours; that is to say, she had performed the journey from Sandy Hook\r\nto Queenstown in four days and a half exactly. Her measurement was\r\nforty-five thousand tons, and her twin screws, driven by quadruple\r\nengines, developing sixty thousand horse-power, forced her through\r\nthe water at the unparalleled speed of thirty knots, or thirty-four\r\nand a half statute miles an hour.\r\n\r\nSince the outbreak of the war it had been found necessary to take all\r\nbut the most powerful vessels off the Atlantic route, for, as had\r\nlong been foreseen, the enemies of the Anglo-German Alliance were\r\nmaking the most determined efforts to cripple the Transatlantic trade\r\nof Britain and Germany, and swift, heavily-armed French and Italian\r\ncruisers, attended by torpedo-boats and gun-boats, and supported by\r\nbattle-ships and depôt vessels for coaling purposes, were swarming\r\nalong the great ocean highway.\r\n\r\nThese, of course, had to be opposed by an equal or greater force of\r\nBritish warships. In fact, the burden of keeping the Atlantic route\r\nopen fell entirely on Britain, for the German and Austrian fleets had\r\nall the work they were capable of doing nearer home in the Baltic and\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe terrible mistake that had been made by the House of Lords in\r\nnegativing the Italian Loan had already become disastrously apparent,\r\nfor though the Anglo-Teutonic Alliance was putting forth every\r\neffort, its available ships were only just sufficient to keep the\r\nhome waters clear and the ocean routes practically open, even for the\r\nfastest steamers.\r\n\r\nThe task, therefore, which lay before the _Aurania_ when she cleared\r\nAmerican waters was little less than running the gauntlet for nearly\r\nthree thousand miles. The French cruiser which had been captured by\r\nthe _Andromeda_, thanks to the assistance of the _Ithuriel_, had left\r\nBrest with the express purpose of helping to intercept the great\r\nCunarder, for she had crossed the Atlantic five times already without\r\na scratch since the war had begun, showing a very clean pair of heels\r\nto everything that had attempted to overhaul her, and now on her\r\nsixth passage a grand effort was to be made to capture or cripple the\r\nfamous ocean greyhound.\r\n\r\nIt was by far her most important voyage in more senses than one. In\r\nthe first place, her incomparable speed and good luck had made her\r\nout of sight the prime favourite with those passengers who were\r\nobliged to cross the Atlantic, war or no war, and for the same\r\nreasons she also carried more mails and specie than any other liner,\r\nand this voyage she had an enormously valuable consignment of both on\r\nboard. As for passengers, every available foot of space was taken for\r\nmonths in advance.\r\n\r\nEnterprising agents on both sides of the water had bought up every\r\nberth from stem to stern, and had put them up to auction, realising\r\nfabulous prices, which had little chance of being abated, even when\r\nher sister ship the _Sidonia_, the construction of which was being\r\npushed forward on the Clyde with all possible speed, was ready to\r\ntake the water.\r\n\r\nBut the chief importance of this particular passage lay, though\r\nbarely half a dozen persons were aware of it, in the fact that among\r\nher passengers was Michael Roburoff, chief of the American Section of\r\nthe Terrorists, who was bringing to the Council his report of the\r\nwork of the Brotherhood in the United States, together with the\r\ninformation which he had collected, by means of an army of spies, as\r\nto the true intentions of the American Government with regard to the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThese, so far as the rest of the world was concerned, were a profound\r\nsecret, and he was the only man outside the President's Cabinet and\r\nthe Tsar's Privy Council who had accurate information with regard to\r\nthem. The _Aurania_ was therefore not only carrying mails, treasure,\r\nand passengers, but, in the person of Michael Roburoff, she was\r\ncarrying secrets on the revelation of which the whole issue of the\r\nwar and the destiny of the world might turn.\r\n\r\nAmerica was the one great Power not involved in the tremendous\r\nstruggle that was being waged. The most astute diplomatist in Europe\r\nhad no idea what her real policy was, but every one knew that the\r\nside on which she threw the weight of her boundless wealth and vast\r\nresources must infallibly win in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe plan that had been adopted by Britain for keeping the Atlantic\r\nroute open was briefly as follows:--All along the 3000 miles of the\r\nsteamer track a battleship was stationed at the end of every day's\r\nrun, that is to say, at intervals of about 500 miles, and patrolled\r\nwithin a radius of 100 miles. Each of these was attended by two\r\nheavily-armed cruisers and four torpedo-boats, while between these\r\npoints swifter cruisers were constantly running to and fro convoying\r\nthe liners.\r\n\r\nThus, when the _Aurania_ left New York, she was picked up on the\r\nlimit of the American water by two cruisers, which would keep pace\r\nwith her as well as they could until she reached the first\r\nbattleship. As she passed the ironclad these two would leave her, and\r\nthe next two would take up the running, and so on until she reached\r\nthe range of operations of the Irish Squadron.\r\n\r\nNo other Power in the world could have maintained such a system of\r\nocean police, but Britain was putting forth the whole of her mighty\r\nnaval strength, and so she spared neither ships nor money to keep\r\nopen the American and Canadian routes, for on them nearly half her\r\nfood-supply depended, as well as her chief line of communication with\r\nthe far East.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, her enemies were making desperate efforts to break\r\nthe chain of steel that was thus stretched across the hemisphere, for\r\nthey well knew that, this once broken, the first real triumph of the\r\nwar would have been won.\r\n\r\nFive hundred miles out from New York the _Aurania_ was joined by the\r\n_Oceana_, the largest vessel on the Canadian Pacific line from\r\nHalifax to Liverpool. So far no enemy had been seen. The two great\r\nliners reached the first battleship together, and were joined by the\r\nsecond pair of cruisers. Before sunset the Cunarder had drawn ahead\r\nof her companions, and by nightfall was racing away alone over the\r\nwater with every light carefully concealed, and keeping an eager\r\nlook-out for friend or foe.\r\n\r\nThere was no moon, and the sky was so heavily overcast with clouds,\r\nthat, under any other circumstances, it would have been the height of\r\nrashness to go rushing through the darkness at such a headlong speed.\r\nBut the captain of the _Aurania_ was aware of the state of the road,\r\nand he knew that in speed and secrecy lay his only chances of getting\r\nhis magnificent vessel through in safety.\r\n\r\nSoon after ten o'clock lights were sighted dead ahead. The course was\r\nslightly altered, and the great liner swept past one of the North\r\nGerman Lloyd boats in company with a cruiser. The private signal was\r\nmade and answered, and in half an hour she was again alone amidst the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven o'clock, when Michael Roburoff, who was standing\r\nunder the lee of one of the ventilators amidships, smoking a last\r\npipe before turning in, saw a figure muffled in a huge grey ulster\r\ncreeping into the deeper shadows under the bridge. It was so dark\r\nthat he could only just make out the outline of the figure, but he\r\ncould see enough to rouse his ever ready suspicions in the furtive\r\nmovements that the man was making.\r\n\r\nHe stole out on the starboard, that is the southward, rail of the\r\nspar-deck, and Michael, straining his eyes to the utmost, saw him\r\ntake a round flat object from under his coat, and then look round\r\nstealthily to see if he was observed. As he did so Michael whipped a\r\npistol out of his pocket, levelled it at the man, and said in a low,\r\ndistinct tone--\r\n\r\n\"Put that back, or I'll shoot!\"\r\n\r\nFor all answer the man raised his arm to throw the object overboard.\r\nMichael, taking the best aim he could in the darkness, fired. The\r\nbullet struck the elbow of the raised arm, the man lurched forward\r\nwith a low cry of rage and pain, grasped the object with his other\r\nhand, and, as he fell to the deck, flung it into the sea.\r\n\r\nScarcely had it touched the water when it burst into flame, and an\r\nintensely bright blaze of bluish-white light shot up, shattering the\r\ndarkness, and illuminating the great ship from the waterline to the\r\ntrucks of her masts. Instantly the deck of the liner was a scene of\r\nwild excitement. In a moment the man whom Roburoff had wounded was\r\nsecured in the act of trying to throw himself overboard. Michael\r\nhimself was rapidly questioned by the captain, who was immediately on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nHe told his story in a dozen words, and explained that he had fired\r\nto disable the man and prevent the fire-signal falling into the sea.\r\nThere was no doubt about the guilt of the traitor, for he himself cut\r\nthe captain's interrogation short by saying defiantly, in broken\r\nEnglish that at once betrayed him as a Frenchman--\r\n\r\n\"Yees, I do it! I give signal to ze fleet down there. If I succeeded,\r\nI got half million francs. I fail, so shoot! C'est la fortune de la\r\nguerre! Voilà, look! They come!\"\r\n\r\nAs the spy said this he pointed to the south-eastern horizon. A brief\r\nbright flash of white light went up through the night and vanished.\r\nIt was the answering signal from the French or Italian cruisers,\r\nwhich were making all speed up from the south-east to head off the\r\n_Aurania_ before she reached the next station and gained the\r\nprotection of the British battleship.\r\n\r\nThe spy's words were only too true. He had gone to America for the\r\nsole purpose of returning in the _Aurania_ and giving the signal at\r\nthis particular point on the passage. Within ten miles were four of\r\nthe fleetest French and Italian cruisers, six torpedo-boats, and two\r\nbattleships, which, by keeping well to the southward during the day,\r\nand then putting on all steam as soon as night fell, had managed to\r\nhead off the ocean greyhound at last.\r\n\r\nTwo cruisers and a battleship with two torpedo-boats were coming up\r\nfrom the south-east; one cruiser, the other battleship, and two\r\ntorpedo-boats were bearing down from the south-west, and the\r\nremaining cruiser and brace of torpedo-boats had managed to slip\r\nthrough the British line and gain a position to the northward.\r\n\r\nThis large force had not been brought up without good reason. The\r\n_Aurania_ was the biggest prize afloat, and well worth fighting for,\r\nif it came to blows, as it very probably would do; added to which\r\nthere was a very good chance of one or two other liners falling\r\nvictims to a well-planned and successful raid.\r\n\r\nThe French spy was at once sent below and put into safe keeping, and\r\nthe signal to \"stoke up\" was sent to the engine-rooms. The firemen\r\nresponded with a will, extra hands were put on in the stokeholes, and\r\nthe furnaces taxed to their utmost capacity. The boilers palpitated\r\nunder the tremendous head of steam, the engines throbbed and groaned\r\nlike labouring giants, and the great ship, trembling like some live\r\nanimal under the lash, rushed faster and faster over the long dark\r\nrollers under the impulse of her whirling screws.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any need for concealment even if it had been\r\npossible. Speed and speed only afforded the sole chance of escape. Of\r\ncourse the captain of the _Aurania_ had no idea of the strength or\r\ndisposition of the force that had undertaken his capture. Had he\r\nknown the true state of the case, his anxiety would have been a good\r\ndeal greater than it was. He fully believed that he could outsteam\r\nthe vessels to the south-east, and, once past these, he knew that he\r\nwould be in touch with the British ships at the next station before\r\nany harm could come to him. He therefore headed a little more to the\r\nnorthward, and trusted with perfect confidence to his heels.\r\n\r\nMichael Roburoff was the hero of the moment, and the captain\r\ncordially thanked him for his prompt attempt to frustrate the\r\natrocious act of the spy which deliberately endangered the liberty\r\nand perhaps the lives of more than a thousand non-combatants.\r\nMichael, however, cut his thanks short by taking him aside and asking\r\nhim what he thought of the position of affairs. He spoke so seriously\r\nthat the captain thought he was frightened, and by way of reassuring\r\nhim replied cheerily--\r\n\r\n\"Don't have any fear for the _Aurania_, Mr. Roburoff. That's only a\r\ncruiser, or perhaps a couple, down there, and the enemy haven't a\r\nship that I can't give a good five knots and a beating to. We shall\r\nsight the British ships soon after daybreak, and by that time those\r\nfellows will be fifty miles behind us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have as much confidence in the _Aurania's_ speed as you have,\r\nCaptain Frazer,\" replied Michael, \"but I'm afraid you are underrating\r\nthe enemy's strength. Do you know that within the last few days it\r\nhas been almost doubled, and that a determined effort is to be made,\r\nnot only to catch or sink the _Aurania_, but also to break the\r\nBritish line of posts, and cut the line of American and Canadian\r\ncommunication altogether?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the captain, looking sharply at Michael. \"I don't\r\nknow anything of the sort, neither do the commanders of the British\r\nwarships on this side. If your information is correct, I should like\r\nto know how you came by it. You are a Russian by name\"--\r\n\r\n\"But not a subject of the Tsar,\" quickly interrupted Michael. \"I am\r\nan American citizen, and I have come by this information not as the\r\nfriend of Russia, as you seem to suspect, but as her enemy, or rather\r\nas the enemy of her ruler. How I got it is my business. It is enough\r\nfor you to know that it is correct, and that you are in far greater\r\ndanger than you think you are. The signal given by that French spy\r\nwas evidently part of a prearranged plan, and for all you know you\r\nmay even now be surrounded, or steaming straight into a trap that has\r\nbeen laid for you. If I may advise, I would earnestly counsel you to\r\ndouble on your course and make every effort to rejoin the other liner\r\nand the cruisers we have passed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, sir, nonsense!\" answered the captain testily. \"Our\r\nwatch-dogs are far too wide awake to be caught napping like that. You\r\nhave been deceived by one of the rumours that are filling the air\r\njust now. You can go to your berth and sleep in peace, and to-morrow\r\nyou shall be half-way across the Atlantic without an enemy's ship in\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Frazer,\" said Michael very seriously, \"with your leave I\r\nshall not go to my berth; and what is more, I can tell you that very\r\nfew of us will get much sleep to-night, and that if you do not back I\r\nhardly think you will be flying the British flag to-morrow. Ha! look\r\nthere--and there!\"\r\n\r\nMichael seized the captain's arm suddenly, and pointed rapidly to the\r\nsouth-east and north-east. Two thin rays of light flashed up into the\r\nsky one after the other. Then came a third from the south-west, and\r\nthen darkness again. At the same instant came the hails from the\r\nlook-outs announcing the lights.\r\n\r\nCaptain Frazer was wrong, and he saw that he was at a glance. The\r\nflash in the north-east could not be from a friend, for it was a\r\nplain answer to the known enemy in the south-east, and so too in all\r\nprobability was the third. If so, the _Aurania_ was almost\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nThe captain wasted no words in confessing his error, but ran up on to\r\nthe bridge to rectify it as far as he could at once. The helm was put\r\nhard over, the port screw was reversed, and the steamer swung round\r\nin a wide sweep, and was soon speeding back westward over her own\r\ntracks. An hour's run brought her in sight of the lights of the\r\n_North German_ and her escort. She slowed as she passed them, and\r\ntold the news. Then she sped on again at full-speed to meet the\r\n_Oceana_ and the two cruisers, which were about fifty miles behind.\r\n\r\nBy one A.M. the three cruisers and the three liners had joined\r\nforces, and were steaming westward at twenty knots an hour, the\r\nliners in single file led by a cruiser, and having one on each beam.\r\nSoon the flashes on the horizon grew more frequent, always drawing\r\ncloser together.\r\n\r\nThen those in the westward dropped from the perpendicular to the\r\nhorizontal, and swept the water as though seeking something. It was\r\nnot long before the darting rays of one of the searchlights fell\r\nacross the track of the British flotilla. Instantly from all three\r\npoints converging flashes were concentrated upon it, revealing the\r\noutline of every ship with the most perfect distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe last hope of running through the hostile fleet unperceived had\r\nnow vanished. There was nothing for it but to go ahead full-speed,\r\nand trust to the chances of a running fight to get clear. With a view\r\nof finding out the strength of the enemy, the British cruisers now\r\nturned their searchlights on and swept the horizon.\r\n\r\nA very few moments sufficed to show that an overwhelming force was\r\nclosing in on them from three sides. They were completely caught in a\r\ntrap, from which there was no escape save by running the gauntlet.\r\nWhichever way they headed they would have to pass through the\r\nconverging fire of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe weakest point, so far as they could see, was the one cruiser and\r\ntwo torpedo-boats to the northward, and so towards them they headed.\r\nAt the speed at which they were travelling it needed but a few\r\nminutes to bring them within range, and the British commanders\r\nrightly decided to concentrate their fire for the present on the\r\nsingle cruiser and her two attendants, in the hope of sinking them\r\nbefore the others could get into action.\r\n\r\nAt three thousand yards the heavy guns came into play, and a storm of\r\nshell was hurled upon the advancing foe, who lost no time in replying\r\nin the same terms. As the vessels approached each other the shooting\r\nbecame closer and terribly effective.\r\n\r\nThe searchlights of the British cruisers were kept full ahead, and\r\nevery attempt of the torpedo-boats to get round on the flank was\r\nfoiled by a hail of shot from the quick-firing guns. Within fifteen\r\nminutes of opening fire one of these was sunk and the other disabled.\r\nThe French cruiser, too, suffered fearfully from the tempest of shot\r\nand shell that was rained upon her.\r\n\r\nHad the British got within range of her half an hour sooner the plan\r\nwould have been completely foiled. As it was, her fate was sealed,\r\nbut it was too late. The three British warships rushed at her\r\ntogether, vomiting flame and smoke and iron across the\r\nrapidly-decreasing distance, until within five hundred yards of her.\r\nThen the fire from the two on either flank suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\nThe centre one, still blazing away, put on her forced draught,\r\nswerved sharply round, and then darted in on her with the ram. There\r\nwas a terrific shock, a heavy, grinding crunch, and then the mighty\r\nmass of the charging vessel, hurled at nearly thirty miles an hour\r\nupon her victim, bored and ground her resistless way into her side.\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly reversed her engines and backed out. In less than\r\nthirty seconds it was all over. The Frenchman, almost cut in half by\r\nthe frightful blow, reeled once, and once only, and then went down\r\nlike a stone.\r\n\r\nBut by this time the other two divisions of the enemy were within\r\nrange, and through the roar of the lighter artillery now came the\r\ndeep, sullen boom of the big guns on the battleships, and the great\r\nthousand-pound projectiles began to scream through the air and fling\r\nthe water up into mountains of foam where they pitched.\r\n\r\nWhere one of them struck, death and destruction would follow as\r\nsurely as though it were a thunderbolt from Heaven. The three liners\r\nscattered and steamed away to the northward as fast as their\r\npropellers would drive them. But what was their utmost speed to that\r\nof the projectiles cleaving through the air at more than two thousand\r\nfeet a second?\r\n\r\nSee! one at length strikes the German liner square amidships, and\r\nbursts. There is a horrible explosion. The searchlight thrown on her\r\nshows a cloud of steam and smoke and flame rising up from her riven\r\ndecks. Where her funnels were is a huge ragged black hole. This is\r\nvisible for an instant, then her back breaks, and in two halves she\r\nfollows the French cruiser to the bottom of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe sinking of the German liner was the signal for the appearance of\r\na new actor on the scene, and the commencement of a work of\r\ndestruction more appalling than anything that human warfare had so\r\nfar known.\r\n\r\nMichael Roburoff, standing on the spar-deck of the flying _Aurania_,\r\nsuddenly saw a bright stream of light shoot down from the clouds, and\r\nflash hither and thither, till it hovered over the advancing French\r\nand Italian squadron. For the moment the combat ceased, so astounded\r\nwere the combatants on both sides at this mysterious apparition.\r\n\r\nThen, without the slightest warning, with no flash or roar of guns,\r\nthere came a series of frightful explosions among the ships of the\r\npursuers. They followed each other so quickly that the darkness\r\nbehind the electric lights seemed lit with a continuous blaze of\r\nlivid green flame for three or four minutes.\r\n\r\nThen there was darkness and silence. Black darkness and absolute\r\nsilence. The searchlights were extinguished, and the roar of the\r\nartillery was still. The British waited in dazed silence for it to\r\nbegin again, but it never did. The whole of the pursuing squadron had\r\nbeen annihilated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"This mysterious apparition.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 178._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW WARFARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will now be necessary, in order to insure the continuity of the\r\nnarrative, to lay before the reader a brief sketch of the course of\r\nevents in Europe from the actual commencement of hostilities on a\r\ngeneral scale between the two immense forces which may be most\r\nconveniently designated as the Anglo-Teutonic Alliance and the\r\nFranco-Slavonian League.\r\n\r\nIn order that these two terms may be fully understood, it will be\r\nwell to explain their general constitution. When the two forces, into\r\nwhich the declaration of war ultimately divided the nations of\r\nEurope, faced each other for the struggle which was to decide the\r\nmastery of the Western world, the Anglo-Teutonic Alliance consisted\r\nprimarily of Britain, Germany, and Austria, and, ranged under its\r\nbanner, whether from choice or necessity, stood Holland, Belgium, and\r\nDenmark in the north-west, with Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey in the\r\nsouth-west.\r\n\r\nEgypt was strongly garrisoned for the land defence of the Suez Canal\r\nand the high road to the East by British, Indian, and Turkish troops.\r\nBritish and Belgian troops held Antwerp and the fortresses of the\r\nBelgian Quadrilateral in force.\r\n\r\nA powerful combined fleet of British, Danish, and Dutch war vessels\r\nof all classes held the approaches by the Sound and Kattegat to the\r\nBaltic Sea, and co-operated in touch with the German fleet; the Dutch\r\nand the German having, at any rate for the time being, and under the\r\npressure of irresistible circumstances, laid aside their hereditary\r\nnational hatred, and consented to act as allies under suitable\r\nguarantees to Holland.\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of Denmark had been secured, in spite of the family\r\nconnections existing between the Danish and the Russian Courts, and\r\nthe rancour still remaining from the old Schleswig-Holstein quarrel,\r\nby very much the same means that had been taken in the historic days\r\nof the Battle of the Baltic. It is true that matters had not gone so\r\nfar as they went when Nelson disobeyed orders by putting his\r\ntelescope to his blind eye, and engaged the Danish fleet in spite of\r\nthe signals; but a demonstration of such overwhelming force had been\r\nmade by sea and land on the part of Britain and Germany, that the\r\nHouse of Dagmar had bowed to the inevitable, and ranged itself on the\r\nside of the Anglo-Teutonic Alliance.\r\n\r\nMarshalled against this imposing array of naval and military force\r\nstood the Franco-Slavonian League, consisting primarily of France,\r\nRussia, and Italy, supported--whether by consent or necessity--by\r\nSpain, Portugal, and Servia. The co-operation of Spain had been\r\npurchased by the promise of Gibraltar at the conclusion of the war,\r\nand that of Portugal by the guarantee of a largely increased sphere\r\nof influence on the West Coast of Africa, plus the Belgian States of\r\nthe Congo.\r\n\r\nRoumania and Switzerland remained neutral, the former to be a\r\nbattlefield for the neighbouring Powers, and the latter for the\r\npresent safe behind her ramparts of everlasting snow and ice.\r\nScandinavia also remained neutral, the sport of the rival diplomacies\r\nof East and West, but not counted of sufficient importance to\r\nmaterially influence the colossal struggle one way or the other.\r\n\r\nIn round numbers the Anglo-Teutonic Alliance had seven millions of\r\nmen on the war footing, including, of course, the Indian and Colonial\r\nforces of the British Empire, while in case of necessity urgent\r\nlevies were expected to produce between two and three millions more.\r\nOpposed to these, the Franco-Slavonian League had about ten millions\r\nunder arms, with nearly three millions in reserve.\r\n\r\nAs regards naval strength, the Alliance was able to pit rather more\r\nthan a thousand warships of all classes, and about the same number of\r\ntorpedo-boats, against nearly nine hundred warships and about seven\r\nhundred torpedo-boats at the disposal of the League.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this latter armament, it is very necessary to name a\r\nfleet of a hundred war-balloons of the type mentioned in an earlier\r\nchapter, fifty of which belonged to Russia and fifty to France. No\r\nother European Power possessed any engine of destruction that was\r\ncapable of being efficiently matched against the invention of M.\r\nRiboult, who was now occupying the position of Director of the aërial\r\nfleet in the service of the League.\r\n\r\nIt would be both a tedious repetition of sickening descriptions of\r\nscenes of bloodshed and a useless waste of space, to enumerate in\r\ndetail all the series of conflicts by sea and land which resulted\r\nfrom the collision of the tremendous forces which were thus arrayed\r\nagainst each other in a conflict that was destined to be unparalleled\r\nin the history of the human race.\r\n\r\nTo do so would be to occupy pages filled with more or less technical\r\ndescriptions of strategic movements, marches, and countermarches,\r\nskirmishes, reconnaissances, and battles, which followed each other\r\nwith such unparalleled rapidity that the combined efforts of the war\r\ncorrespondents of the European press proved entirely inadequate to\r\nkeep pace with them in the form of anything like a continuous\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be necessary to ask the reader to remain content\r\nwith such brief summary as has been given, supplemented with the\r\nfollowing extracts from a very lengthy _résumé_ of the leading events\r\nof the war up to date, which were published in a special War\r\nSupplement issued by the _Daily Telegraph_ on the morning of Tuesday\r\nthe 28th of June 1904:--\r\n\r\n\"Although little more than a period of six weeks has elapsed since\r\nthe actual outbreak of hostilities which marked the commencement of\r\nwhat, be its issue what it may, must indubitably prove the most\r\ncolossal struggle in the history of human warfare, changes have\r\nalready occurred which must infallibly mark their effect upon the\r\nfuture destiny of the world. Almost as soon as the first shot was\r\nfired the nations of Europe, as if by instinct or under the influence\r\nof some power higher than that of international diplomacy,\r\nautomatically marshalled themselves into the two most mighty hosts\r\nthat have ever trod the field of battle since man first fought with\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Not less than twenty millions of men are at this moment facing each\r\nother under arms throughout the area of the war. These are almost\r\nequally divided; for, although what is now known as the\r\nFranco-Slavonian League has some three millions of men more on land,\r\nit may be safely stated that the preponderance of naval strength\r\npossessed by the Anglo-Teutonic Alliance fully counterbalances this\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"There is, however, another most important element which has now for\r\nthe first time been introduced into warfare, and which, although it\r\nis most unhappily arrayed amongst the forces opposed to our own\r\ncountry and her gallant allies, it would be both idle and most\r\nimprudent to ignore. We refer, of course, to the two fleets of\r\nwar-balloons, or, as it would be more correct to call them, navigable\r\naerostats, possessed by France and Russia.\r\n\r\n\"So tremendous has been the influence which these terrible inventions\r\nhave exercised upon the course of the war, that we are not\r\ntransgressing the bounds of sober truth when we say that they have\r\nutterly disconcerted and brought to nought the highest strategy and\r\nthe most skilfully devised plans of the brilliant array of masters of\r\nthe military art whose presence adorns the ranks and enlightens the\r\ncouncils of the Alliance.\r\n\r\n\"Since the day when the Russians crossed the German and Austrian\r\nfrontiers, and the troops of France and Italy simultaneously flung\r\nthemselves across the western frontiers of Germany and through the\r\npasses of the Tyrol, their progress, unparalleled in rapidity even by\r\nthe marvellous marches of Napoleon, has been marked, not by what we\r\nhave hitherto been accustomed to call battles, but rather by a series\r\nof colossal butcheries.\r\n\r\n\"In every case of any moment the method of procedure on the part of\r\nthe attacking forces has been the same, and, with the deepest regret\r\nwe confess it, it has been marked with the same unvarying success.\r\nWhenever a large army has been set in motion upon a predetermined\r\npoint of attack, whether a fortress, an entrenched camp, or a\r\nstrongly occupied position in the field, a squadron of aerostats has\r\nwinged its way through the air under cover of the darkness of night,\r\nand silently and unperceived has marked the disposition of forces,\r\nthe approximate strength of the army or the position to be attacked,\r\nand, as far as they were observable, the points upon which the attack\r\ncould be most favourably delivered. Then they have returned with\r\ntheir priceless information, and, according to it, the assailants\r\nhave been able, in every case so far, to make their assault where\r\nleast expected, and to make it, moreover, upon an already partially\r\ndemoralised force.\r\n\r\n\"From the detailed descriptions which we have already published of\r\nbattles and sieges, or rather of the storming of great fortresses, it\r\nwill be remembered that every assault on the part of the troops of\r\nthe League has been preceded by a preliminary and irresistible attack\r\nfrom the clouds.\r\n\r\n\"The aerostats have stationed themselves at great elevations over the\r\nramparts of fortresses and the bivouacs of armies, and have rained\r\ndown a hail of dynamite, melinite, fire-shells and cyanogen\r\npoison-grenades, which have at once put guns out of action, blown up\r\nmagazines, rendered fortifications untenable, and rent masses of\r\ninfantry and squadrons of cavalry into demoralised fragments, before\r\nthey had the time or the opportunity to strike a blow in reply. Then\r\nupon these silenced batteries, these wrecked fortifications, and\r\nthese demoralised brigades, there has been poured a storm of\r\nartillery fire from the untouched enemy, advancing in perfect order,\r\nand inspired with high-spirited confidence, which has been\r\nirresistibly opposed to the demoralisation of their enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Is it any wonder, or any disgrace, to the defeated, that under such\r\nnovel and appalling conditions the orderly and disciplined onslaughts\r\nof the legions of the League have in almost every case been\r\ncompletely successful? The sober truth is that the invention and\r\nemployment of these devastating appliances have completely altered\r\nthe face of the field of battle and the conditions of modern warfare.\r\nIt is not in human valour, no matter how heroic or self-devoted it\r\nmay be, to oppose itself with anything like confidence to an enemy\r\nwhich strikes from the skies, and cannot be struck in return.\r\n\r\n\"It was thus that the battles of Alexandrovo, Kalisz, and Czernowicz\r\nwere won in the early stages of the war upon the Austro-German\r\nfrontier. So, too, in the Rhine Provinces, were the battles of\r\nTreves, Mulhausen, and Freiburg turned by the aid of the French\r\naerostats from battles into butcheries. It was under the assault of\r\nthese irresistible engines that the great fortresses of Königsberg,\r\nThorn, Breslau, Strasburg, and Metz, to say nothing of many minor,\r\nbut strongly fortified, places, were first reduced to a state of\r\nimpotence for defence, and then battered into ruins by the siege-guns\r\nof the assailants.\r\n\r\n\"All these terrible events, forming a series of catastrophes\r\nunparalleled in the annals of war, are still fresh in the minds of\r\nour readers, for they have followed one upon the other with almost\r\nstupefying rapidity, and it is yet hardly six weeks since the\r\nCossacks and Uhlans were engaged in their first skirmish near Gnesen.\r\n\r\n\"This is an amazingly brief space of time for the fate of empires to\r\nbe decided, and yet we are forced, with the utmost sorrow and\r\nreluctance, to admit that what were two months ago the magnificently\r\ndisciplined and equipped armies of Germany and Austria, are now\r\ncompletely shattered and broken up into fragmentary and isolated army\r\ncorps, decimated as to numbers and demoralised as to discipline,\r\ngathered in and about such strong places as are left to them, and\r\nawaiting only with the courage of desperation the moment, we fear the\r\ninevitable moment, when they shall be finally crushed between the\r\nrapidly converging hosts of the victorious League.\r\n\r\n\"Within the next few days, Berlin, Hanover, Prague, Munich, and\r\nVienna must be invested, and may possibly be destroyed or compelled\r\nto ignominious and unconditional surrender by the irresistible forces\r\nthat will be arrayed against them.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, with still deeper regret, we are forced to confess that\r\nthose operations in the Low Countries and the east of Europe and Asia\r\nMinor in which our own gallant troops have been engaged in\r\nconjunction with their several allies, have been, if not equally\r\ndisastrous, at least void of any tangible success.\r\n\r\n\"Erzeroum, Trebizond, and Scutari have fallen; the passes of the\r\nBalkans have been forced, although at immense cost to the enemy;\r\nBelgrade has been stormed; Adrianople is invested, and Constantinople\r\nis therefore most seriously threatened.\r\n\r\n\"By heroic efforts the French attack upon the Quadrilateral has been\r\nrolled back at a fearful expense of human life. Antwerp is still\r\nuntouched, and the command of the Baltic is still ours. In our own\r\nwaters, as well as in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, we have won\r\nvictories which prove that Great Britain is still the unconquered,\r\nand we trust unconquerable, mistress of the seas. We have kept the\r\nDardanelles open, and the Suez Canal is still inviolate.\r\n\r\n\"Two combined attacks, delivered by the allied French and Italian\r\nsquadrons on Malta and Gibraltar, have been repulsed by Admiral\r\nBeresford with heavy loss to the enemy, thanks to the timely warning\r\ndelivered to Mr. Balfour by the Earl of Alanmere--upon whose\r\nmysterious disappearance we comment in another column--and the Prime\r\nMinister's prompt and statesmanlike action in doubling the strength\r\nof the Mediterranean fleet before the outbreak of hostilities.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to the tireless activity and splendid handling of the Channel\r\nfleet, the North Sea Division, and the Irish Squadron, the enemy's\r\nflag has been practically swept from the home waters, and the shores\r\nof our beloved country are as inviolate as they have been for more\r\nthan seven centuries. These brilliant achievements go far to\r\ncompensate us as an individual nation for the disasters which have\r\nbefallen our allies on the Continent, and, in addition, we have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that, so far, the most complete success has\r\nattended our arms in the East, and that the repeated and determined\r\nassaults of our Russian foes have been triumphantly hurled back from\r\nthe impregnable bulwarks of our Indian Empire.\r\n\r\n\"It has been pointed out, and it would be vain to ignore the fact,\r\nthat not only have all our victories been won in the absence of the\r\naërial fleets of the League; but that we, in common with our allies,\r\nhave been worsted in each of the happily few cases in which even one\r\nof these terrible aerostats has delivered its assaults upon us.\r\nAgainst this, however, we take leave to set our belief that these\r\nmachines do not yet inspire sufficient confidence in their possessors\r\nto warrant them in undertaking operations above the sea, or at any\r\nconsiderable distance from their bases of manoeuvring. It is true\r\nthat we are entirely ignorant of the essentials of their\r\nconstruction; but the fact that no attempt has yet been made to send\r\nthem into action over blue water inspires us with the hope and belief\r\nthat their effective range of operations is confined to the land....\r\n\r\n\"It would be superfluous to say that the British Empire is now\r\ninvolved in a struggle in comparison with which all our former wars\r\nsink into absolute insignificance, a struggle which will tax its\r\nimmense resources to the very utmost. Nothing, however, has yet\r\noccurred to warrant the belief that those resources will not prove\r\nequal to the strain, or that the greatest empire on earth will not\r\nemerge from this combat of the giants with her ancient glory enhanced\r\nby new and hitherto unequalled triumphs.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly at no period in our history have we been so splendidly\r\nprepared to face our enemies both at home and abroad. All arms of the\r\nServices are in the highest state of efficiency, and the Government\r\ndockyards and arsenals, as well as private firms, are working day and\r\nnight to still further strengthen them, and provide ample supplies of\r\nmunitions of war. The hearts of all the nations united under our flag\r\nare beating as that of one man, and from the highest to the lowest\r\nranks of Society all are inspired by a spirit of whole-souled\r\npatriotism which, if necessary, will make any sacrifice to preserve\r\nthe flag untarnished, and the honour of Britain without a spot.\r\n\r\n\"At the head of affairs stands the man who of all others has proved\r\nhimself to be the most fitted to direct the destinies of the empire\r\nin this tremendous crisis of her history. Party feeling for the time\r\nbeing has almost entirely disappeared, save amongst the few scattered\r\nbands of isolated Revolutionaries and malcontents, and Mr. Balfour\r\npossesses the absolute confidence of his Majesty on the one hand, and\r\nthe undivided support of an impregnable majority in both Houses of\r\nParliament on the other. He is admirably seconded by such lieutenants\r\nas Lord Randolph Churchill, Sir Joseph Chamberlain, and Sir George J.\r\nGoschen on his own side of the House, and by the Earls of Rosebery\r\nand Morley, Lord Brassey, and Sir Charles Dilke in what, previous to\r\nthe outbreak of the war, was the opposing political camp, but which\r\nis now a party as loyal as that of the Government to the best\r\ninterests of the Empire, and fully determined to give the utmost\r\npossible moral support consistent with fair and impartial criticism.\r\n\r\n\"The disastrous mistake which was made by a very small majority of\r\nthe Upper House in rejecting the Government guarantee for the\r\nill-fated Italian loan is now, of course, past repair; for Italy, as\r\nevents have proved, exasperated by what her spokesmen termed her\r\nselfish betrayal by Britain, has passionately thrown herself into the\r\narms of the League, and the Alliance has now no more bitter enemy\r\nthan she is. It is, however, only justice to those who defeated the\r\nloan to add that they have now clearly seen and frankly owned their\r\ngrievous mistake, and rallied as one man to the support of the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE HERALDS OF DISASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother column in the same issue contained an account of the\r\n\"Mysterious Disappearance of Lord Alanmere\" and the doings of the\r\n_Ithuriel_ in the Atlantic. The account concluded as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"As the enemy's squadron came up in chase it was annihilated without\r\nwarning and with appalling suddenness by the air-ship, which must\r\nhave crossed the Atlantic in something like sixteen hours. After this\r\nfearful achievement it descended to the _Aurania_, took off a saloon\r\npassenger named Michael Roburoff, evidently, from his reception, a\r\nTerrorist himself, and then vanished through the clouds. For the\r\npresent, and until we have fuller information, we attempt no detailed\r\nanalysis of these astounding events. We merely content ourselves with\r\nsaying in the most solemn words that we can use, that, awful and\r\ndisastrous as is the war that is now raging throughout the greatest\r\npart of the old world, it is our firm belief that, behind the\r\nsmoke-clouds of battle, and beneath the surface of visible events,\r\nthere is working a secret power, possibly greater than any which has\r\nyet been called into action, and which at an unexpected moment may\r\nsuddenly put forth its strength, upheave the foundations of Society,\r\nand bury existing institutions in the ruins of Civilisation.\r\n\r\n\"One fact is quite manifest, and that is, that although the League\r\npossesses a weapon of fearful efficiency for destruction in their\r\nfleet of aerostats, the Terrorists, controlled by no law save their\r\nown, and hampered by no traditions or limitations of civilised\r\nwarfare, are in command of another fleet of unknown strength, the\r\nair-ships of which are apparently as superior to the aerostats of the\r\nLeague as a modern battleship would be to a three-decker of the time\r\nof Nelson.\r\n\r\n\"The power represented by such a fleet as this is absolutely\r\ninconceivable. The aerostats are large, clumsy, and comparatively\r\nslow. They do not carry guns, and can only drop their projectiles\r\nvertically downwards. Moreover, their sphere of operations has so far\r\nbeen entirely confined to the land.\r\n\r\n\"Very different, however, would seem to be the powers of the\r\nTerrorist air-ships. They have proved conclusively that they are\r\nswift almost beyond imagination. They have crossed oceans and\r\ncontinents in a few hours; they can ascend to enormous heights, and\r\nthey carry artillery of unknown design and tremendous range, whose\r\nprojectiles excel in destructiveness the very lightnings of heaven\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"In the presence of such an awful and mysterious power as this even\r\nthe quarrels of nations seem to shrink into unimportance, and almost\r\nto pettiness. Where and when it may strike, no man knows save those\r\nwho wield it, and therefore there is nothing for the peoples of the\r\nearth, however mighty they may be, to do but to await the blow in\r\nhumiliating impotence, but still with a humble trust in that Higher\r\nPower which alone can save it from accomplishing the destruction of\r\nSociety and the enslavement of the human race.\"\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined with what interest, and it may fairly be\r\nadded with what intense anxiety, these words were read by hundreds of\r\nthousands of people throughout the British Islands. Even the news\r\nfrom the Seat of War began to pall in interest before such tidings as\r\nthese, invested as they were with the irresistible if terrible charm\r\nof the unknown and the mysterious.\r\n\r\nBy noon it was almost impossible to get any one in London or any of\r\nthe large towns to talk of anything but the disappearance of Lord\r\nAlanmere, the Terrorists, and their marvellous aërial fleet. But it\r\ngoes without saying that nowhere did the news produce greater\r\ndistress or more utter bewilderment than it did among the occupants\r\nof Alanmere Castle, and especially in the breast of her who had been\r\nso quickly and so strangely installed as its new owner and mistress.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the wildest rumours passed from lip to lip, growing in\r\nsensation and absurdity as they went. A report, telegraphed by an\r\nanonymous idiot from Liverpool, to the effect that six air-ships had\r\nappeared over the Mersey, and demanded a ransom of £10,000,000 from\r\nthe town, was eagerly seized on by the cheaper evening papers, which\r\nrushed out edition after edition on the strength of it, until the\r\n_St. James's Gazette_ put an end to the excitement by publishing a\r\ntelegram from the Mayor of Liverpool denouncing the report as an\r\ninsane and criminal hoax.\r\n\r\nThe next edition of the _St. James's_, however, contained a telegram\r\nfrom Hiorring, in Denmark, _viâ_ Newcastle, which was of almost, if\r\nnot quite, as startling and disquieting a nature, and which,\r\nmoreover, contained a very considerable measure of truth. The\r\ntelegram ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n      NAVAL DISASTER IN THE BALTIC.\r\n\r\n      _The Sound forced by a Russian Squadron, assisted by a\r\n      Terrorist Air-Ship._\r\n\r\n      (_From our own Correspondent._)\r\n\r\n      Hiorring, _June 28th_, 8 A.M.\r\n\r\n    With the deepest regret I have to record the first naval disaster\r\n    to the British arms during the present war. As soon as it became\r\n    dark last night heavy firing was heard from Copenhagen to the\r\n    southward, and before long the sound deepened into an almost\r\n    continuous roar of light and heavy guns.\r\n\r\n    Our naval force in the Baltic was so strong that it was deemed\r\n    incredible that the Russian fleet, which we have held imprisoned\r\n    here since the commencement of hostilities, should dream even of\r\n    making an attempt to escape. The cannonade, however, was the\r\n    beginning of such an attempt, and it is useless disguising the\r\n    fact that it has been completely successful. That this would have\r\n    been the case, or, indeed, that the attempt would ever have been\r\n    made by the Russian fleet alone, cannot be for a moment credited.\r\n    But, incredible as it seems, it is nevertheless true that it was\r\n    assisted, and that in a practically irresistible fashion, by one\r\n    of those air-ships which have hitherto been believed to belong\r\n    exclusively to the Terrorists, that is to say, to the deadliest\r\n    enemies that Russia possesses.\r\n\r\n    As nearly as is known the Russian fleet consisted of twelve\r\n    battleships, twenty-five armoured and unarmoured cruisers, and\r\n    about forty torpedo-boats. These came charging ahead at full\r\n    speed into the entrance to the Sound in spite of the overwhelming\r\n    force of the Allied fleets, supported by the fortresses of\r\n    Copenhagen and Elsinore. The attack was so sudden and so\r\n    completely unexpected, that it must be confessed the defenders\r\n    were to a certain extent taken unawares. The Russians came on in\r\n    the form of an elongated wedge, their most powerful vessels being\r\n    at the apex and external sides.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"On the water the results of the air-ship's attack\r\n    were destructive almost beyond description.\"\r\n\r\n    _See page 191._]\r\n\r\n    The firing was furious and sustained from beginning to end of the\r\n    rush, but the damage inflicted by the cannonade of the Russian\r\n    fleet and the torpedo-boats, which every now and then darted out\r\n    from between the warships as opportunity offered to employ their\r\n    silent and deadly weapons, was as nothing in comparison with the\r\n    frightful havoc achieved by the air-ship.\r\n\r\n    This extraordinary craft hovered over the attacking force,\r\n    darting hither and thither with bewildering rapidity, and raining\r\n    down shells charged with an unknown explosive of fearful power\r\n    among the crowded ships of the great force which was blocking the\r\n    Sound. Half a dozen of these shells were fired upon the seaward\r\n    fortifications of Copenhagen in passing, and produced a perfectly\r\n    paralysing effect.\r\n\r\n    On the water the results of the air-ship's attack were\r\n    destructive almost beyond description, particularly when she\r\n    stationed herself over the Allied fleet and began firing her four\r\n    guns right and left, ahead and astern. Every time a shell struck\r\n    either a battleship or a cruiser, the terrific explosion which\r\n    resulted either sank the ship in a few minutes, or so far\r\n    disabled it that it fell an easy prey to the guns and rams of the\r\n    Russians. As for the torpedo-boats which were struck, they were\r\n    simply scattered over the water in indistinguishable fragments.\r\n\r\n    Under these conditions maintenance of formation and effective\r\n    fighting were practically impossible, and the huge iron wedge of\r\n    the Russian squadron was driven almost without a check through\r\n    the demoralised ranks of the Allied fleet. The Gut of Elsinore\r\n    was reached in a little more than three hours after the first\r\n    sounds of the cannonade were heard. Shortly before this the\r\n    air-ship had stationed itself about a thousand feet above the\r\n    water, and a mile from the fortifications.\r\n\r\n    From this position it commenced a brief, rapid cannonade from its\r\n    smokeless and flameless guns, the effects of which on the\r\n    fortress are said to have been indescribably awful. Great blocks\r\n    of steel-sheathed masonry were dislodged from the ramparts and\r\n    hurled bodily into the sea, carrying with them guns and men to\r\n    irretrievable destruction. In less than half an hour the once\r\n    impregnable fortress of Elsinore was little better than a heap of\r\n    ruins. The last shell blew up the central magazine; the\r\n    tremendous explosion was heard for miles along the coast, and\r\n    proved to be the closing act of the briefest but most deadly\r\n    great naval action in the history of war.\r\n\r\n    The Russian fleet steamed triumphantly past the silenced Cerberus\r\n    of the Sound with flashing searchlights, blazing rockets, and\r\n    jubilant salvos of blank cartridge in honour of their really\r\n    brilliant victory.\r\n\r\n    The losses of the Allied fleet, so far as they are at present\r\n    known, are distressingly heavy. We have lost the battleships\r\n    _Neptune_, _Hotspur_, _Anson_, _Superb_, _Black Prince_, and\r\n    _Rodney_, the armoured cruisers _Narcissus_, _Beatrice_, and\r\n    _Mersey_, the unarmoured cruisers _Arethusa_, _Barossa_, _Clyde_,\r\n    _Lais_, _Seagull_, _Grasshopper_, and _Nautilus_, and not less\r\n    than nineteen torpedo-boats of the first and second classes.\r\n\r\n    The Germans and Danes have lost the battleships _Kaiser Wilhelm_,\r\n    _Friedrich der Grosse_, _Dantzig_, _Viborg_, and _Funen_, five\r\n    German and three Danish cruisers, and about a dozen\r\n    torpedo-boats.\r\n\r\n    Under whatever circumstances the Russians have obtained the\r\n    assistance of the air-ship, which rendered them services that\r\n    have proved so disastrous to the Allies, there can be no doubt\r\n    but that her arrival on the scene puts a completely different\r\n    aspect on the face of affairs at sea.\r\n\r\n    I have written this telegram on board first-class torpedo-boat,\r\n    No. 87, which followed the Russian fleet from the Sound round the\r\n    Skawe. They passed through the Kattegat in two columns of line\r\n    ahead, with the air-ship apparently resting after her flight on\r\n    board one of the largest steamers. We could see her quite\r\n    distinctly by the glare of the rockets and the electric light.\r\n    She is a small three-masted vessel almost exactly resembling the\r\n    one which partially destroyed Kronstadt in the middle of March.\r\n\r\n    After rounding the Skawe, the Russian fleet steamed away westward\r\n    into the German Ocean, and we put in here to send off our\r\n    despatches. This telegram has, of course, been officially\r\n    revised, and my information, as far as it goes, can therefore be\r\n    relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nAN INTERLUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt noon on the 26th, as the tropical sun was pouring down its\r\nvertical rays upon the lovely valley of Aeria, the _Ithuriel_ crossed\r\nthe Ridge which divided it from the outer world, and came to rest on\r\nthe level stretch of sward on the northern shore of the lake.\r\n\r\nBefore she touched the earth Arnold glanced rapidly round and\r\ndiscovered his aërial fleet resting under a series of large\r\npalm-thatched sheds which had already been erected to protect them\r\nfrom the burning sun, and the rare but violent tropical rain-storms.\r\nHe counted them. There were only eleven, and therefore the evil\r\ntidings that they had heard from the captain of the _Andromeda_ was\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nEven before greetings were exchanged with the colonists Natas ordered\r\nNicholas Roburoff to be summoned on board alone. He received him in\r\nthe lower saloon, on either side of which, as he went in, he found a\r\nmember of the crew armed with a magazine rifle and fixed bayonet.\r\n\r\nSeated at the cabin table were Natas, Tremayne, and Arnold. The\r\nPresident was received in cold and ominous silence, not even a glance\r\nof recognition was vouchsafed to him. He stood at the other end of\r\nthe table with bowed head, a prisoner before his judges. Natas looked\r\nat him for some moments in dead silence, and there was a dark gleam\r\nof anger in his eyes which made Arnold tremble for the man whose life\r\nhung upon a word of a judge from whose sentence there could be no\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nAt length Natas spoke; his voice was hard and even; there were no\r\nmodulations in it that displayed the slightest feeling, whether of\r\nanger or any other emotion. It was like the voice of an impassive\r\nmachine speaking the very words of Fate itself.\r\n\r\n\"You know why we have returned, and why you have been sent for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"\r\n\r\nRoburoff's voice was low and respectful, but there was no quaver of\r\nfear in it.\r\n\r\n\"You were left here in command of the settlement and in charge of the\r\nfleet. You were ordered to permit no vessel to leave the valley till\r\nthe flagship returned. One of them was seen crossing the\r\nMediterranean in a northerly direction three days ago. Either you are\r\na traitor, or that vessel is in the hands of traitors. Explain.\"\r\n\r\nNicholas Roburoff remained silent for a few moments. His breast\r\nheaved once or twice convulsively, as though he were striving hard to\r\nrepress some violent emotion. Then he drew himself up like a soldier\r\ncoming to attention, and, looking straight in front of him, told his\r\nstory briefly and calmly, though he knew that, according to the laws\r\nof the Order, its sequel might, and probably would, be his own death.\r\n\r\n\"The night of the day on which the flagship left the valley was\r\nvisited by a violent storm, which raged for about four hours without\r\ncessation. We had no proper shelter but the air-ships, and so I\r\ndistributed the company among them.\r\n\r\n\"When nearly all had been provided for, there was one vessel left\r\nunoccupied, and four of the unmarried men had not been accommodated.\r\nThey therefore took their places in the spare vessel. They were Peter\r\nTamboff, Amos Vornjeh, Ivan Tscheszco, and Paul Oreloff, all\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\n\"We closed the hatches of the vessels, and remained inside till the\r\nstorm ceased. When we were able to open the hatches again, it was\r\npitch dark--so dark that it was impossible to see even a yard from\r\none's face. Suspecting no evil, we retired to rest again till\r\nsunrise. When day dawned it was found that the vessel in which the\r\nfour men I have named had taken shelter had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"I at once ordered three vessels to rise and pass through the defile.\r\nOn the outside we separated and made the entire circuit of Aeria,\r\nrising as high as the fan-wheels would take us, and examining the\r\nhorizon in all directions for the missing vessel.\r\n\r\n\"We failed to discover her, and were forced to the conclusion that\r\nthe deserters had taken her away early in the night at full speed,\r\nand would, therefore, be far beyond the possibility of capture, as we\r\npossessed no faster vessel than the missing one. So we returned. That\r\nis all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the forward cabin and remain there till you're sent for,\" said\r\nNatas.\r\n\r\nThe President instantly turned and walked mechanically through the\r\ndoor that was opened for him by one of the sentinels. The other went\r\nin front of him, the second behind, closing the door as he left the\r\nsaloon.\r\n\r\nA brief discussion took place between Natas and his two lieutenants,\r\nand within a quarter of an hour Nicholas Roburoff was again standing\r\nat the end of the table to hear the decision of his judges. Without\r\nany preamble it was delivered by Natas in these words--\r\n\r\n\"We have heard your story, and believe it. You have been guilty of a\r\nserious mistake, for these four men were all ordinary members of the\r\nOuter Circle, who had only been brought here on account of their\r\nmechanical skill to occupy subordinate positions. You therefore\r\ncommitted a grave error, amounting almost to a breach of the rule\r\nwhich states that no members of the Outer Circle shall be entrusted\r\nwith any charge, or work, save under the supervision of a member of\r\nthe Inner Circle responsible for them.\r\n\r\n\"Had such a breach been even technically committed your life would\r\nhave been forfeited, and you would have been executed for breach of\r\ntrust. We have considered the circumstances, and find you guilty of\r\nindiscretion and want of forethought.\r\n\r\n\"You will cease from now to be President of the Inner Circle. Your\r\nplace will be taken for the time by Alan Tremayne as Chief of the\r\nExecutive. You will cease also to share the Councils of the Order for\r\na space of twelve months, during which time you will be incapable of\r\nany responsible charge or authority. Your restoration will, of\r\ncourse, depend upon your behaviour. I have said.\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking Natas waved his hand towards the door. It was\r\nopened, the sentries stepped aside, and Nicholas Roburoff walked out\r\nin silence, with bowed head and a heart heavy with shame. The penalty\r\nwas really the most severe that could be inflicted on him, for he\r\nfound himself suddenly deprived both of authority and the confidence\r\nof his chiefs at the very hour when the work of the Brotherhood was\r\nculminating to its fruition.\r\n\r\nYet, heavy as the punishment seemed in comparison with the fault, it\r\nwas justified by the necessities of the case. Without the strictest\r\nsafeguards, not only against treachery or disobedience, but even mere\r\ncarelessness, it would have been impossible to have carried on the\r\ntremendous work which the Brotherhood had silently and secretly\r\naccomplished, and which was soon to produce results as momentous as\r\nthey would be unexpected. No one knew this better than the late\r\nPresident himself, who frankly acknowledged the justice and the\r\nnecessity of his punishment, and prepared to devote himself heart and\r\nsoul to regaining his lost credit in the eyes of the Master.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the sentence pronounced than the matter was instantly\r\ndismissed and never alluded to again, so far as Roburoff was\r\nconcerned, by any one. No one presumed even to comment upon a word or\r\ndeed of the Master. The disgraced President fell naturally, and\r\napparently without observation, into his humbler sphere of duties,\r\nand the members of the colony treated him with exactly the same\r\nfriendliness and fraternity as they had done before. Natas had\r\ndecided, and there was nothing more for any one to say or do in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nArnold, as soon as he had exchanged greetings with the Princess, now\r\nknown simply as Anna Ornovski, and his other friends and\r\nacquaintances in the colony, not, of course, forgetting Louis Holt,\r\nat once shut himself up in his laboratory by the turbine, and for the\r\nnext four hours remained invisible, preparing a large supply of his\r\nmotor gases, and pumping them into the exhausted cylinders of the\r\n_Ithuriel_, and all the others that were available, by means of his\r\nhydraulic machinery.\r\n\r\nSoon after four he had finished his task, and come out to take his\r\npart in a ceremony of a very different character to that at which he\r\nhad been obliged to assist earlier in the day. This was the\r\nfulfilment of the promise which Radna Michaelis had made to Colston\r\nin the Council-chamber of the house on Clapham Common on the evening\r\nof his departure on the expedition which had so brilliantly proved\r\nthe powers of the _Ariel_, and brought such confusion on the enemies\r\nof the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first words that Colston had said to Radna when he boarded\r\nthe _Avondale_ were--\r\n\r\n\"Natasha is yonder, safe and sound, and you are mine at last!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she had replied very quietly, yet with a thrill in her voice that\r\ntold her lover how gladly she accepted her own condition--\r\n\r\n\"What you have fairly won is yours to take when you will have it.\r\nBesides, you cannot do justice on Kastovitch now, for it has already\r\nbeen done. We had news before we left England that he had been shot\r\nthrough the heart by the brother of a girl whom he treated worse than\r\nhe treated me.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as has been stated before, the laws of the Brotherhood did not\r\npermit of the marriage of any of its members without the direct\r\nsanction of Natas, and therefore it had been necessary to wait until\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAs Radna and Colston were two of the most trusted and prominent\r\nmembers of the Inner Circle, it was fitting that their wedding should\r\nbe honoured by the presence of the Master in person. An added\r\nsolemnity was also given to it by the fact that, in all human\r\nprobability, it was the first time since the world began that the\r\nmighty hills which looked down upon Aeria had witnessed the plighting\r\nof the troth of a man and a woman.\r\n\r\nLike all other formal acts of the Brotherhood, the ceremony was\r\nsimple in the extreme; but, in this case at least, it was none the\r\nless impressive on that account. In a lovely glade, through which a\r\ncrystal stream ran laughing on its way to the lake, Natas sat under\r\nthe shade of a spreading tree-fern. In front of him was a small table\r\ncovered with a white cloth, on which lay a roll of parchment and a\r\ncopy of the Hebrew Scriptures.\r\n\r\nAt this table, facing Natas, stood the betrothed pair with their\r\nwitnesses, Natasha for Radna, and Arnold for Colston, or Alexis\r\nMazanoff, to give him his true name, which must, of course, be used\r\non such an occasion. In a wide semicircle some four yards off stood\r\nall the members of the little community, Louis Holt and his faithful\r\nservitor not excepted.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a silence broken only by the whispering of the warm,\r\nscented wind in the tree-tops, the Master of the Terror spoke in a\r\nkindly yet solemn tone--\r\n\r\n\"Alexis Mazanoff and Radna Michaelis, you stand here before Heaven,\r\nand in the presence of your comrades, to take each other for wedded\r\nwife and husband, till death shall part the hands that now are\r\njoined!\r\n\r\n\"Your mutual vows have long ago been pledged, and what you are about\r\nto do is good earnest of their fulfilment. But above the duty that\r\nyou owe to each other stands your duty to that great Cause to which\r\nyou have already irrevocably devoted your lives. You have already\r\nsworn that as long as you shall live its ends shall be your ends, and\r\nthat no human considerations shall weigh with you where those ends\r\nare concerned. Do you take each other for husband and wife subject to\r\nthat condition and all that it implies?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do!\" replied the lovers with one voice, and then Natas went on--\r\n\r\n\"Then by the laws of our Order, the only laws that we are permitted\r\nto obey, I pronounce you man and wife before Heaven and this company.\r\nBe faithful to each other and the Cause in the days to come as you\r\nhave been in the days that are past, and if it shall please the\r\nMaster of Destiny that you shall be blessed with children, see to it\r\nthat you train them up in the love of truth, freedom, and justice,\r\nand in the hatred of tyranny and wrong.\r\n\r\n\"May the blessings of life be yours as you shall deserve them, and\r\nwhen the appointed hour shall come, may you be found ready to pass\r\nfrom the mystery of the things that are into the deeper mystery of\r\nthe things that are to be!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the Master raised his hands as though in blessing, and as\r\nAlexis and Radna bent their heads the slanting sunrays fell upon the\r\nthickly coiled white hair of the new-made wife, crowning her shapely\r\nhead like a diadem of silver.\r\n\r\nAll that remained to do now was to sign the Marriage Roll of the\r\nBrotherhood, and when they had done this the entry stood as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Married on the tenth day of the Month Tamuz, in the Year of the\r\n    World five thousand six hundred and sixty-four, in the presence\r\n    of me, Natas, and those of the Brotherhood now resident in the\r\n    Colony of Aeria:--\r\n\r\n      {ALEXIS MAZANOFF,\r\n      {RADNA MICHAELIS MAZANOFF.\r\n\r\n      Witnesses   {RICHARD ARNOLD,\r\n                  {NATASHA.\r\n\r\nAs Natasha laid down the pen after signing she looked up quickly, as\r\nthough moved by some sudden impulse, her eyes met Arnold's, and an\r\ninstant later the happy flush on Radna's cheek was rivalled by that\r\nwhich rose to her own. Her lips half parted in a smile, and then she\r\nturned suddenly away to be the first to offer her congratulations to\r\nthe newly-wedded wife, while Arnold, his heart beating as it had\r\nnever done since the model of the _Ariel_ first rose from the floor\r\nof his room in the Southwark tenement-house, grasped Mazanoff by the\r\nhand and said simply--\r\n\r\n\"God bless you both, old man!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole ceremony had not taken more than fifteen minutes from\r\nbeginning to end. After Arnold came Tremayne with his good wishes,\r\nand then Anna Ornovski and the rest of the friends and comrades of\r\nthe newly-wedded lovers.\r\n\r\nOne usually conspicuous feature in similar ceremonies was entirely\r\nwanting. There were no wedding presents. For this there was a very\r\nsufficient reason. All the property of the members of the Inner\r\nCircle, saving only articles of personal necessity, were held in\r\ncommon. Articles of mere convenience or luxury were looked upon with\r\nindifference, if not with absolute contempt, and so no one had\r\nanything to give.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this was not a very serious matter for a company of men\r\nand women who held in their hands the power of levying indemnities to\r\nany amount upon the wealth-centres of the world under pain of\r\nimmediate destruction.\r\n\r\nThat evening the supper of the colonists took the shape of a sylvan\r\nmarriage feast, eaten in the open air under the palms and tree ferns,\r\nas the sun was sinking down behind the western peaks of Aeria, and\r\nthe full moon was rising over those to the eastward.\r\n\r\nThe whole earth might have been searched in vain for a happier\r\ncompany of men and women than that which sat down to the marriage\r\nfeast of Radna Michaelis and Alexis Mazanoff in the virgin groves of\r\nAeria. For the time being the world-war and all its horrors were\r\nforgotten, and they allowed their thoughts to turn without restraint\r\nto the promise of the days when the work of the Brotherhood should be\r\naccomplished, and there should be peace on earth at last.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that three of the air-ships would be sufficient\r\nfor the chase and capture or destruction, as the case might be, of\r\nthe deserters. These were the _Ithuriel_, under the command of\r\nArnold; the _Ariel_, commanded by Mazanoff, who, of course, did not\r\nsail alone; and the _Orion_, in charge of Tremayne, who had already\r\nmastered the details of aërial navigation under Arnold's tuition.\r\n\r\nTo the unspeakable satisfaction of the latter, Natas had signified\r\nhis intention of accompanying him in the _Ithuriel_. As Natasha\r\nutterly refused to be parted so soon from her father again, one of\r\nhis attendants was dispensed with and she took his place. This fact\r\nhad, of course, something to do with the Admiral's satisfaction with\r\nthe arrangement.\r\n\r\nBy nine o'clock the moon was high in the heavens. At that hour the\r\nfan-wheels of the little squadron rose from the decks, and at a\r\nsignal from Arnold began to revolve. The three vessels ascended\r\nquietly into the air amidst the cheers and farewells of the\r\ncolonists, and in single file passed slowly down the beautiful valley\r\nbathed in the brilliant moonlight. One by one they disappeared\r\nthrough the defile that led to the outer world, and, once clear of\r\nthe mountains, the _Ithuriel_, with one of her consorts on either\r\nside, headed away due north at the speed of a hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nON THE TRACK OF TREASON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Ithuriel_ and her consorts crossed the northern coast of Africa\r\nsoon after daybreak on the 27th, in the longitude of Alexandria, at\r\nan elevation of nearly 4000 feet. From thence they pursued almost the\r\nsame course as that steered by the deserters, as Natas had rightly\r\njudged that they would first make for Russia, probably St.\r\nPetersburg, and there hand the air-ship over to the representatives\r\nof the Tsar.\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, another alternative, and that was the\r\nsupposition that they had stolen the _Lucifer_--the \"fallen Angel,\"\r\nas Natasha had now re-named her--for purposes of piracy and private\r\nrevenge; but that was negatived by the fact that Tamboff knew that he\r\nonly had a certain supply of motive power which he could not renew,\r\nand which, once exhausted, left his air-ship as useless as a steamer\r\nwithout coal. His only reasonable course, therefore, would be to sell\r\nthe vessel to the Tsar, and leave his Majesty's chemists to discover\r\nand renew the motive power if they could.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions once arrived at, it was an easy matter for the keen\r\nand subtle intellect of Natas to deduce from them almost the exact\r\nsequence of events that had actually taken place. The _Lucifer_ had a\r\nsufficient supply of power-cylinders and shells for present use, and\r\nthese would doubtless be employed at once by the Tsar, who would\r\ntrust to his chemists and engineers to discover the nature of the\r\nagents employed.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose it would be absolutely necessary for him to give\r\nthem one or two of the shells, and at least two of the spare\r\npower-cylinders as subjects for their experiments.\r\n\r\nNow Natas knew that if there was one man in Russia who could discover\r\nthe composition of the explosives, that man was Professor Volnow of\r\nthe Imperial Arsenal Laboratory, and therefore the shells and\r\ncylinders would be sent to him at the Arsenal for examination. The\r\nwhereabouts of the deserters for the present mattered nothing in\r\ncomparison with the possible discovery of the secret on which the\r\nwhole power of the Terrorists depended.\r\n\r\nThat once revealed, the sole empire of the air was theirs no longer.\r\nThe Tsar, with millions of money at his command, could very soon\r\nbuild an aërial fleet, not only equal, but, numerically at least,\r\nvastly superior to their own, and this would practically give him the\r\ncommand of the world.\r\n\r\nNatas therefore came to the conclusion that no measures could be too\r\nextreme to be justified by such a danger as this, and so, after a\r\nconsultation with the commanders of the three vessels, it was decided\r\nto, if necessary, destroy the Arsenal at St. Petersburg, on the\r\nstrength of the reasoning that had led to the logical conclusion that\r\nwithin its precincts the priceless secret either might be or had\r\nalready been discovered.\r\n\r\nAs the crow flies, St. Petersburg is thirty degrees of latitude, or\r\neighteen hundred geographical miles, north of Alexandria, and this\r\ndistance the _Ithuriel_ and her consorts, flying at a speed of a\r\nhundred and twenty miles an hour, traversed in fifteen hours,\r\nreaching the Russian capital a few minutes after seven on the evening\r\nof the 27th.\r\n\r\nThe Rome of the North, basking in the soft evening sunlight of the\r\nincomparable Russian summer, lay vast and white and beautiful on the\r\nislands formed by the Neva and its ten tributaries; its innumerable\r\npalaces, churches, and theatres, and long straight streets of stately\r\nhouses, its parks and gardens, and its green shady suburbs, making up\r\na picture which forced an exclamation of wonder from Arnold's lips as\r\nthe air-ships slowed down and he left the conning-tower of the\r\n_Ithuriel_ to admire the magnificent view from the bows. They passed\r\nover the city at a height of four thousand feet, and so were quite\r\nnear enough to see and enjoy the excitement and consternation which\r\ntheir sudden appearance instantly caused among the inhabitants. The\r\nstreets and squares filled in an inconceivably short space of time\r\nwith crowds of people, who ran about like tiny ants upon the ground,\r\ngesticulating and pointing upwards, evidently in terror lest the fate\r\nof Kronstadt was about to fall upon St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe experimental department of the Arsenal had within the last two or\r\nthree years been rebuilt on a large space of waste ground outside the\r\nnorthern suburbs, and to this the three air-ships directed their\r\ncourse after passing over the city. It was a massive three-storey\r\nbuilding, built in the form of a quadrangle. The three air-ships\r\nstopped within a mile of it at an elevation of two thousand feet. It\r\nhad been decided that, before proceeding to extremities, which, after\r\nall, might still leave them in doubt as to whether or not they had\r\nreally destroyed all means of analysing the explosives, they should\r\nmake an effort to discover whether Professor Volnow had received them\r\nfor experiment, and, if so, what success he had had.\r\n\r\nMazanoff had undertaken this delicate and dangerous task, and so, as\r\nsoon as the _Ithuriel_ and the _Orion_ came to a standstill, and hung\r\nmotionless in the air, with all their guns ready trained on different\r\nparts of the building, the _Ariel_ sank suddenly and swiftly down,\r\nand stopped within forty feet of the heads of a crowd of soldiers and\r\nmechanics, who had rushed pell-mell out of the building, under the\r\nimpression that it was about to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe bold manoeuvre of the _Ariel_ took officers and men completely by\r\nsurprise. So intense was the terror in which these mysterious\r\nair-ships were held, and so absolute was the belief that they were\r\narmed with perfectly irresistible means of destruction, that the\r\nsight of one of them at such close quarters paralysed all thought and\r\naction for the time being. The first shock over, the majority of the\r\ncrowd took to their heels and fled incontinently. Of the remainder a\r\nfew of the bolder spirits handled their rifles and looked inquiringly\r\nat their officers. Mazanoff saw this, and at once raised his hand\r\ntowards the sky and shouted--\r\n\r\n\"Ground arms! If a shot is fired the Arsenal will be destroyed as\r\nKronstadt was, and then we shall attack Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\nThe threat was sufficient. A grey-haired officer in undress uniform\r\nglanced up at the _Ithuriel_ and her consort, and then at the guns of\r\nthe _Ariel_, all four of which had been swung round and brought to\r\nbear on the side of the building near which she had descended. He was\r\nno coward, but he saw that Mazanoff had the power to do what he said,\r\nand that even if this one air-ship were captured or destroyed, the\r\nother two would take a frightful vengeance. He thought of Kronstadt,\r\nand decided to parley. The rifle butts had come to the ground before\r\nMazanoff had done speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Order arms, and keep silence!\" said the officer, and then he\r\nadvanced alone from the crowd and said--\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, and what is your errand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alexis Mazanoff, late prisoner of the Tsar, and now commander of the\r\nTerrorist air-ship _Ariel_. I have not come to destroy you unless you\r\nforce me to do so, but to ask certain questions, and demand the\r\ngiving up of certain property delivered into your hands by deserters\r\nand traitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are your questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, is Professor Volnow in the building?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I must ask you to send for him at once.\"\r\n\r\nIt went sorely against the grain of the servant of the Tsar to\r\nacquiesce in the demand of an outlaw, but there was nothing else for\r\nit. The outlaw could blow him and all his subordinates into space\r\nwith a pressure of his finger; and so he sent an orderly with a\r\nrequest for the presence of the professor. Meanwhile Mazanoff\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n\"An air-ship similar to this arrived here three days ago, I believe?\"\r\n\r\nThe officer bit his lips with rage at his helpless position, and\r\nbowed affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\"And certain articles were taken out of her for examination here--two\r\ngas cylinders and a projectile, I believe?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the officer bowed, wondering how on earth the Terrorist could\r\nhave come by such accurate information.\r\n\r\n\"And the air-ship has been sent on to the seat of war, while the\r\nProfessor is trying to discover the composition of the gases and the\r\nexplosive used in the shell?\" went on Mazanoff, risking a last shot\r\nat the truth.\r\n\r\nThe officer did not bow this time. Giving way at last to his rising\r\nfury, he stamped on the ground and almost screamed--\r\n\r\n\"Great God! you insolent scoundrel! Why do you ask me questions when\r\nyou know the answers as well as I do, and better? Yes, we have got\r\none of your diabolical ships of the air, and we will build a fleet\r\nlike it and hunt you from the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"All in good time, my dear sir,\" replied Mazanoff ironically. \"When\r\nyou have found a place in which to build them that we cannot blow off\r\nthe face of the earth before you get one finished. Meanwhile, let me\r\nbeg of you to keep your temper, and to remember that there is a lady\r\npresent. That girl standing yonder by the gun was once stripped and\r\nflogged by Russians calling themselves men and soldiers. Her fingers\r\nare itching to make the movement that would annihilate you and every\r\none standing near you, so pray try keep your temper; for if we fire a\r\nshot the air-ships up yonder will at once open fire, and not stop\r\nwhile there is a stone of that building left upon another. Ah! here\r\ncomes the Professor.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the man of science advanced, looking wonderingly at the\r\nair-ship. Mazanoff made a sign to the old officer to keep silence,\r\nand continued in the same polite tone that he had used all along--\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Professor! I have come to ask you whether you have yet\r\nmade any experiments on the contents of the shell and the two\r\ncylinders that were given to you for examination?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must first ask for your authority to put such an inquiry to me on\r\na confidential subject,\" replied the Professor stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"On the authority given me by the power to enforce an answer, sir,\"\r\nreturned the Terrorist quietly. \"I know that Professor Volnow will\r\nnot lie to me, even at the order of the Tsar, and when I tell you\r\nthat your refusal to reply will cost the lives of every one here, and\r\npossibly involve the destruction of Petersburg itself, I feel sure\r\nthat, as a mere matter of humanity, you will comply with my request.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the orders of my master are absolute secrecy on this subject,\r\nand I will obey them to the death. I have analysed the contents of\r\none of the cylinders, but what they are I will tell to no one save by\r\nthe direct command of his Majesty. That is all I have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in that case, Professor, I must ask you to surrender yourself\r\nprisoner of war, and to come on board this vessel at once.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mazanoff said this the _Ariel_ dropped to within ten feet of the\r\nground, and a rope-ladder fell over the side.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Professor, there is no time to be lost. I shall give the order\r\nto fire in one minute from now.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out his watch, and began to count the seconds. Ten, twenty,\r\nthirty passed and the Professor stood irresolute. Two of the\r\n_Ariel's_ guns pointed at the gables of the Arsenal, and two swept\r\nthe crowded space in front.\r\n\r\nKonstantin Volnow knew enough to see clearly the frightful slaughter\r\nand destruction that twenty seconds more would bring if he refused to\r\ngive himself up. As Mazanoff counted \"forty\" he threw up his hands\r\nwith a gesture of despair, and cried--\r\n\r\n\"Stop! I will come. The Tsar has as good servants as I am! Colonel,\r\ntell his Majesty that I gave myself up to save the lives of better\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Professor mounted the ladder amidst a murmur of relief and\r\napplause from the crowd, and, gaining the deck of the _Ariel_, bowed\r\ncoldly to Mazanoff and said--\r\n\r\n\"I am your prisoner, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Ariel_ bowed in reply, and stamped thrice on the\r\ndeck. The fan-wheels whirled round, and the air-ship rapidly\r\nascended, at the same time moving diagonally across the quadrangle of\r\nthe Arsenal.\r\n\r\nScarcely had she reached the other side when there was a tremendous\r\nexplosion in the north-eastern angle of the building. A sheet of\r\nflame shot up through the roof, the walls split asunder, and masses\r\nof stone, wood, and iron went flying in all directions, leaving only\r\na fiercely burning mass of ruins where the gable had been.\r\n\r\nThe Professor turned ashy pale, staggered backwards with both his\r\nhands clasped to his head, and gasped out brokenly as he stared at\r\nthe conflagration--\r\n\r\n\"God have mercy on me! My laboratory! My assistant--I told him\"--\r\n\r\n\"What did you tell him, Professor?\" said Mazanoff sternly, grasping\r\nhim suddenly by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"I told him not to open the other cylinder.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he has done so, and paid for his disobedience with his life,\"\r\nsaid Mazanoff calmly. \"Console yourself, my dear sir! He has only\r\nsaved me the trouble of destroying your laboratory. I serve a sterner\r\nand more powerful master than yours. He ordered me to make your\r\nexperiments impossible if it cost a thousand lives to do so, and I\r\nwould have done it if necessary. Rest content with the knowledge that\r\nyou have saved, not only the rest of the Arsenal, but also\r\nPetersburg, by your surrender; for sooner than that secret had been\r\nrevealed, we should have laid the city in ruins to slay the man who\r\nhad discovered it.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner of the Terrorists made no reply, but turned away in\r\nsilence to watch the rapidly receding building, in the angle of which\r\nthe flames were still raging furiously. A few minutes later the\r\n_Ariel_ had rejoined her consorts. Her captain at once went on board\r\nthe flagship to make his report and deliver up his prisoner to Natas,\r\nwho looked sharply at him and said--\r\n\r\n\"Professor, will you give me your word of honour to attempt no\r\ncommunication with the earth while it may be found necessary to\r\ndetain you? If not, I shall be compelled to keep you in strict\r\nconfinement till it is beyond your power to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I give you my word that I will not do so,\" said the Professor,\r\nwho had now somewhat regained his composure.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Natas. \"Then on that condition you will be made\r\nfree of the vessel, and we will make you as comfortable as we can.\r\nCaptain Arnold, full speed to the south-westward, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA SKIRMISH IN THE CLOUDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few minutes after two on the following morning, that is to say on\r\nthe 28th, the electric signal leading from the conning-tower of the\r\n_Ithuriel_ to the wall of Arnold's cabin, just above his berth,\r\nsounded. As it was only permitted to be used on occasions of urgency,\r\nhe knew that his presence was immediately required forward for some\r\ngood reason, and so he turned out at once, threw a dressing-gown over\r\nhis sleeping suit, and within three minutes was standing in the\r\nconning-tower beside Andrew Smith, whose watch it then happened to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Smith, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fleet of war-balloons coming up from the south'ard, sir. You can\r\njust see 'em, sir, coming on in line under that long bank of cloud.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Ithuriel_ took the night-glasses, and looked\r\neagerly in the direction pointed out by his keen-eyed coxswain. As\r\nsoon as he picked them up he had no difficulty in making out twelve\r\nsmall dark spots in line at regular intervals sharply defined against\r\na band of light that lay between the earth and a long dark bank of\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nIt was a division of the Tsar's aërial fleet, returning from some\r\nwork of death and destruction in the south to rejoin the main force\r\nbefore Berlin. Arnold's course was decided on in an instant. He saw a\r\nchance of turning the tables on his Majesty in a fashion that he\r\nwould find as unpleasant as it would be unexpected. He turned to his\r\ncoxswain and said--\r\n\r\n\"How is the wind, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor'-nor'-west, with perhaps half a point more north in it, sir.\r\nAbout a ten-knot breeze--at least that's the drift that Mr. Marston's\r\nallowing for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's near enough. Then those fellows, if they are going full\r\nspeed, are coming up at about twenty miles an hour, or not quite\r\nthat. They're nearly twenty miles off, as nearly as I can judge in\r\nthis light. What do you make it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about it, sir; rather less than more, if anything, to my\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then. Now signal to stop, and send up the fan-wheels; and\r\ntell the _Ariel_ and the _Orion_ to close up and speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" said the coxswain, as he saluted and disappeared.\r\nArnold at once went back to his cabin and dressed, telling his second\r\nofficer, Frank Marston, a young Englishman, whom he had chosen to\r\ntake Mazanoff's place, to do the same as quietly as possible, as he\r\ndid not wish to awaken any of his three passengers just at present.\r\n\r\nBy the time he got on deck the three air-ships had slowed down\r\nconsiderably, and the two consorts of the _Ithuriel_ were within easy\r\nspeaking distance. Mazanoff and Tremayne were both on deck, and to\r\nthem he explained his plans as follows--\r\n\r\n\"There are a dozen of the Tsar's war-balloons coming up yonder to the\r\nsouthward, and I am going to head them off and capture the lot if I\r\ncan. If we can do that, we can make what terms we like for the\r\nsurrender of the _Lucifer_.\r\n\r\n\"You two take your ships and get to windward of them as fast as you\r\ncan. Keep a little higher than they are, but not much. On no account\r\nlet one of them get above you. If they try to descend, give each one\r\nthat does so a No. 1 shell, and blow her up. If one tries to pass\r\nyou, ram her in the upper part of the gas-holder, and let her down\r\nwith a smash.\r\n\r\n\"I am going up above them to prevent any of them from rising too far.\r\nThey can outfly us in that one direction, so I shall blow any that\r\nattempt it into little pieces. If you have to fire on any of them,\r\ndon't use more than No. 1; you'll find that more than enough.\r\n\r\n\"Keep an eye on me for signals, and remember that the whole fleet\r\nmust be destroyed rather than one allowed to escape. I want to give\r\nthe Tsar a nice little surprise. He seems to be getting a good deal\r\ntoo cock-sure about these old gas-bags of his, and it's time to give\r\nhim a lesson in real aërial warfare.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not a great newspaper in the world that would not have\r\ngiven a very long price to have had the privilege of putting a\r\nspecial correspondent on the deck of the _Ithuriel_ for the two hours\r\nwhich followed the giving of Arnold's directions to his brother\r\ncommanders of the little squadron. The journal which could have\r\npublished an exclusive account of the first aërial skirmish in the\r\nhistory of the world would have scored a triumph which would have\r\nleft its competitors a long way behind in the struggle to be \"up to\r\ndate.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Arnold had given his orders, the three air-ships at once\r\nseparated. The _Ariel_ and the _Orion_ shot away to the southward on\r\nonly a slightly upward course, while the _Ithuriel_ soared up beyond\r\nthe stratum of clouds which lay in thin broken masses rather more\r\nthan four thousand feet above the earth.\r\n\r\nIt was still rather more than an hour before sunrise, and, as the\r\nmoon had gone down, and the clouds intercepted most of the starlight,\r\nit was just \"the darkest hour before the dawn,\" and therefore the\r\nmost favourable for the carrying out of the plan that Arnold had in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nShortly after half-past two he knocked at Natasha's cabin-door, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"If you would like to see an aërial battle, get up and come into the\r\nconning-tower at once. We have overtaken a squadron of Russian\r\nwar-balloons, and we are going either to capture or destroy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glorious!\" exclaimed Natasha, wide awake in an instant at such\r\nstartling news. \"I'll be with you in five minutes. Tell my father,\r\nand please don't begin till I come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't think of opening the ball without your ladyship's\r\npresence,\" laughed Arnold in reply, and then he went and called Natas\r\nand his attendant and the Professor before going to the\r\nconning-tower, where in a very few minutes he was joined by Natasha.\r\nThe first words she said were--\r\n\r\n\"I have told Ivan to send us some coffee as soon as he has attended\r\nto my father. You see how thoughtful I am for your creature comforts.\r\nNow, where are the war-balloons?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Come now, and fire the first shot in the warfare of\r\nthe future.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 211._]\r\n\r\n\"On the other side of those clouds. There, look down through that big\r\nrift, and you will see one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what a height we must be from the earth! The balloon looks like\r\na little toy thing, but it must be a great clumsy contrivance for all\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The barometer gives five thousand three hundred feet. You will soon\r\nsee why I have come up so high. The balloons can rise to fifteen or\r\ntwenty thousand feet, if they wish to, and in that way they could\r\neasily escape us; therefore, if one of them attempts to rise through\r\nthose clouds, I shall send him back to earth in little bits.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are the other two air-ships doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are below the clouds, heading the balloons off from the Russian\r\ncamp, which is about fifty miles to the north-westward. Ha! look,\r\nthere go the searchlights!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, two long converging beams of light darted across a broad\r\nspace of sky that was free from cloud. They came from the _Ariel_ and\r\nthe _Orion_, which thus suddenly revealed themselves to the\r\nastonished and disgusted Russians, one at each end of their long\r\nline, and only a little more than half a mile ahead of it.\r\n\r\nThe searchlights flashed to and fro along the line, plainly showing\r\nthe great masses of the aerostats' gas-holders, with their long\r\nslender cars beneath them. A blue light was burnt on the largest of\r\nthe war-balloons, and at once the whole flotilla began to ascend\r\ntowards the clouds, followed by the two air-ships.\r\n\r\n\"Here they come!\" said Arnold, as he saw them rising through a\r\ncloud-rift. \"Come out and watch what happens to the first one that\r\nshows herself.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out on deck, followed by Natasha, and took his place by one\r\nof the broadside guns. At the same time he gave the order for the\r\n_Ithuriel's_ searchlight to be turned on, and to sweep the\r\ncloud-field below her. Presently a black rounded object appeared\r\nrising through the clouds like a whale coming to the surface of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHe trained the gun on to it as it came distinctly into view, and said\r\nto Natasha--\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, and fire the first shot in the warfare of the future. Put\r\nyour finger on the button, and press when I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nNatasha did as he told her, and at the word \"Fire!\" pressed the\r\nlittle ivory button down. The shell struck the upper envelope of the\r\nballoon, passed through, and exploded. A broad sheet of flame shot\r\nup, brilliantly illuminating the sea of cloud for an instant, and all\r\nwas darkness again. A few seconds later there came another blaze, and\r\nthe report of a much greater explosion from below the clouds.\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" asked Natasha.\r\n\r\n\"That was the car full of explosives striking the earth and going off\r\npromiscuously,\" replied Arnold. \"There isn't as much of that aerostat\r\nleft as would make a pocket-handkerchief or a walking-stick.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never knew what happened to them. In the new warfare people will not\r\nbe merely killed, they will be annihilated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible!\" exclaimed Natasha, with a shudder. \"I think you may do\r\nthe rest of the shooting. The effects of that shot will last me for\r\nsome time. Look, there's another of them coming up!\"\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth before Arnold had crossed to\r\nthe other side of the deck and sped another missile on its errand of\r\ndestruction with almost exactly the same result as before. This\r\nsecond shot, as it was afterwards found, threw the Russian squadron\r\ninto complete panic.\r\n\r\nThe terrific suddenness with which the two aerostats had been\r\ndestroyed convinced those in command of the others that there was a\r\nlarge force of air-ships above the clouds ready to destroy them one\r\nby one as they ascended. Arnold waited for a few minutes, and then,\r\nseeing that no others cared to risk the fate that had overwhelmed the\r\nfirst two that had sought to cross the cloud-zone, sank rapidly\r\nthrough it, and then stopped again.\r\n\r\nHe found himself about six hundred feet above the rest of the\r\nsquadron. The _Ithuriel_ coming thus suddenly into view, her eight\r\nguns pointing in all directions, and her searchlight flashing hither\r\nand thither as though seeking new victims, completed the\r\ndemoralisation of the Russians. For all they knew there were still\r\nmore air-ships above the clouds. Even this one could not be passed\r\nwhile those mysterious guns of unknown range and infallible aim were\r\nsweeping the sky, ready to hurl their silent lightnings in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAscend they dare not. To descend was to be destroyed in detail as\r\nthey lay helpless upon the earth. There was only one chance of\r\nescape, and that was to scatter. The commander of the squadron at\r\nonce signalled for this to be done, and the aerostats headed away to\r\nall points of the compass. But here they had reckoned without the\r\nincomparable speed of their assailants.\r\n\r\nBefore they had moved a hundred yards from their common centre the\r\n_Ariel_ and the _Orion_ headed away in different directions, and in\r\nan inconceivably short space of time had described a complete circle\r\nround them, and then another and another, narrowing each circle that\r\nthey made. One of the aerostats, watching its opportunity, put on\r\nfull speed and tried to get outside the narrowing zone. She had\r\nalmost succeeded, when the _Orion_ swerved outwards and dashed at her\r\nwith the ram.\r\n\r\nIn ten seconds she was overtaken. The keen steel prow of the\r\nair-ship, driven at more than a hundred miles an hour, ripped her\r\ngas-holder from end to end as if it had been tissue paper. It\r\ncollapsed like broken bubble, and the wreck, with its five occupants\r\nand its load of explosives, dropped like a stone to the earth, three\r\nthousand feet below, exploding like one huge shell as it struck.\r\n\r\nThis was the last blow struck in the first aërial battle in the\r\nhistory of warfare. The Russians had no stomach for this kind of\r\nfighting. It was all very well to sail over armies and fortresses on\r\nthe earth and drop shells upon them without danger of retaliation;\r\nbut this was an entirely different matter.\r\n\r\nThree of the aerostats had been destroyed in little more than as many\r\nminutes, so utterly destroyed that not a vestige of them remained,\r\nand the whole squadron had not been able to strike a blow in\r\nself-defence. They carried no guns, not even small arms, for they had\r\nno use for them in the work that they had to do. There were only two\r\nalternatives before them--surrender or piecemeal destruction.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had destroyed the third aerostat, the _Orion_ swerved\r\nround again, and began flying round the squadron as before in an\r\nopposite direction to the _Ariel_. None of the aerostats made an\r\nattempt to break the strange blockage again. As the circles narrowed\r\nthey crowded closer and closer together, like a flock of sheep\r\nsurrounded by wolves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Ithuriel_, floating above the centre of the disordered\r\nsquadron, descended slowly until she hung a hundred feet above the\r\nhighest of them. Then Arnold with his searchlight flashed a signal to\r\nthe _Ariel_ which at once slowed down, the _Orion_ continuing on her\r\ncircular course as before.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the _Ariel_ was going slowly enough for him to make\r\nhimself heard, Mazanoff shouted through a speaking-trumpet--\r\n\r\n\"Will you surrender, or fight it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Nu vot_! how can we fight with those devil-ships of yours? What is\r\nyour pleasure?\"\r\n\r\nThe answering hail came from one of the aerostats in the centre of\r\nthe squadron. Mazanoff at once replied--\r\n\r\n\"Unconditional surrender for the present, under guarantee of safety\r\nto every one who surrenders. Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Alexei Alexandrovitch, in command of the squadron. I\r\nsurrender on those terms. Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain of the Terrorist air-ship _Ariel_. Be good enough to\r\ncome out here, Colonel Alexei Alexandrovitch.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the aerostats moved out of the midst of the Russian squadron\r\nand made its way towards the _Ariel_. As she approached Mazanoff\r\nswung his bow round and brought it level with the car of the\r\naerostat, at the same time training one of his guns full on it. Then,\r\nwith his arm resting on the breach of the gun, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Come on board, Colonel, and bid your balloon follow me. No nonsense,\r\nmind, or I'll blow you into eternity and all your squadron after\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe Russian did as he was bidden, and the _Ariel_, followed by the\r\naerostat, ascended to the _Ithuriel_, while the _Orion_ kept up her\r\npatrol round the captive war-balloons.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Alexandrovitch, in command of the Tsar's aërial squadron,\r\nsurrenders unconditionally, save for guarantee of personal safety to\r\nhimself and his men,\" reported Mazanoff, as he came within earshot of\r\nthe flagship.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" replied Arnold from the deck of the _Ithuriel_. \"You will\r\nkeep Colonel Alexandrovitch as hostage for the good behaviour of the\r\nrest, and shoot him the moment one of the balloons attempts to\r\nescape. After that destroy the rest without mercy. They will form in\r\nline close together. The _Ariel_ and the _Orion_ will convoy them on\r\neither flank, and you will follow me until you have the signal to\r\nstop. On the first suspicion of any attempt to escape you will know\r\nwhat to do. You have both handled your ships splendidly.\"\r\n\r\nMazanoff saluted formally, more for the sake of effect than anything\r\nelse, and descended again to carry out his orders. The captured\r\nflotilla was formed in line, the balloons being closed up until there\r\nwas only a couple of yards or so between any of them and her next\r\nneighbour, with the _Orion_ and the _Ariel_ to right and left, each\r\nwith two guns trained on them, and the _Ithuriel_ flying a couple of\r\nhundred feet above them. In this order captors and captured made\r\ntheir way at twenty miles an hour to the north-west towards the\r\nheadquarters of the Tsar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nAN EMBASSY FROM THE SKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the captured war-balloons had been formed in order, and\r\nthe voyage fairly commenced, the eastern sky was bright with the\r\nforeglow of the coming dawn, and, as the flotilla was only floating\r\nbetween eight and nine hundred feet above the earth, it was not long\r\nbefore the light was sufficiently strong to render the landscape\r\ncompletely visible.\r\n\r\nFar and wide it was a scene of desolation and destruction, of wasted,\r\nblackened fields trampled into wildernesses by the tread of countless\r\nfeet, of forests of trees broken, scorched, and splintered by the\r\niron hail of artillery, and of towns and villages, reduced to heaps\r\nof ruins, still smouldering with the fires that had destroyed them.\r\n\r\nNo more eloquent object-lesson in the horrors of what is called\r\ncivilised warfare could well have been found than the scene which was\r\nvisible from the decks of the air-ships. The promised fruits of a\r\nwhole year of patient industry had been withered in a few hours under\r\nthe storm-blast of war; homes which but a few days before had\r\nsheltered stalwart, well-fed peasants and citizens, were now mere\r\nheaps of blackened brick and stone and smoking thatches.\r\n\r\nStreets which had been the thoroughfares of peaceful industrious\r\nfolk, who had no quarrel with the Powers of the earth, or with any of\r\ntheir kind, were now strewn with corpses and encumbered with ruins,\r\nand the few survivors, more miserable than those who had died, were\r\ncrawling, haggard and starving, amidst the wrecks of their vanished\r\nprosperity, seeking for some scanty morsels of food to prolong life\r\nif only for a few more days of misery and nights of sleepless\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose and shed its midsummer splendour, as if in sublime\r\nmockery, over the scene of suffering and desolation, hideous features\r\nof the landscape were brought into stronger and more horrifying\r\nrelief; the scorched and trampled fields were seen to be strewn with\r\nunburied corpses of men and horses, and ploughed up with cannon shot\r\nand torn into great irregular gashes by shells that had buried\r\nthemselves in the earth and then exploded.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that some frightful tragedy must have taken place in\r\nthis region not many hours before the air-ships had arrived upon the\r\nscene. And this, in fact, had been the case. Barely three days\r\npreviously the advance guard of the Russian army of the North had\r\nbeen met and stubbornly but unsuccessfully opposed by the remnants of\r\nthe German army of the East, which, driven back from the frontier,\r\nwas retreating in good order to join the main force which had\r\nconcentrated about Berlin, under the command of the Emperor, there to\r\nfight out the supreme struggle, on the issue of which depended the\r\nexistence of that German Empire which fifty years before had been so\r\ntriumphantly built up by the master-geniuses of the last generation.\r\n\r\nAfter a flight of a little over two hours the flotilla came in sight\r\nof the Russian army lying between Cüstrin on the right and\r\nFrankfort-on-Spree on the left. The distance between these two towns\r\nis nearly twelve English miles, and yet the wings of the vast host\r\nunder the command of the Tsar spread for a couple of miles on either\r\nside to north and south of each of them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the colossal iniquity which it concealed, the spectacle\r\nwas one of indescribable grandeur. Almost as far as the eye could\r\nreach the beams of the early morning sun were gleaming upon\r\ninnumerable white tents, and flashing over a sea of glittering metal,\r\nof bare bayonets and sword scabbards, of spear points and helmets, of\r\ngold-laced uniforms and the polished accoutrements of countless\r\nbatteries of field artillery.\r\n\r\nFar away to the westward the stately city of Berlin could be seen\r\nlying upon its intersecting waters, and encircled by its\r\nfortifications bristling with guns, and in advance of it were the\r\nlong serried lines of its defenders gathered to do desperate battle\r\nfor home and fatherland.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Russian army was fairly in sight the _Ithuriel_ shot\r\nahead, sank to the level of the flotilla, and then stopped until she\r\nwas overtaken by the _Orion_. Tremayne was on deck, and Arnold as\r\nsoon as he came alongside said--\r\n\r\n\"You must stop here for the present. I want the aerostat commanded by\r\nColonel Alexandrovitch to come with me; meanwhile you and the _Ariel_\r\nwill rise with the rest of the balloons to a height of four thousand\r\nfeet; you will keep strict guard over the balloons, and permit no\r\nmovement to be made until my return. We are going to bring his\r\nMajesty the Tsar to book, or else make things pretty lively for him\r\nif he won't listen to reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Tremayne. \"I will do as you say, and await\r\ndevelopments with considerable interest. If there is going to be a\r\nfight, I hope you're not going to leave us out in the cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" replied Arnold. \"You needn't be afraid of that. If his\r\nMajesty won't come to terms, you will smash up the war-balloons and\r\nthen come and join us in the general bombardment. I see, by the way,\r\nthat there are ten or a dozen more of these unwieldy monsters with\r\nthe Russian force moored to the ground yonder on the outskirts of\r\nCüstrin. It will be a little amusement for us if we have to come to\r\nblows to knock them to pieces before we smash up the Tsar's\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nSo saying, Arnold increased the speed of the _Ithuriel_, swept round\r\nin front of the line, and communicated the same instructions to the\r\ncaptain of the _Ariel_.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the _Ariel_ and the _Orion_ began to rise with\r\ntheir charges to the higher regions of the air, leaving the\r\n_Ithuriel_ and the one aerostat to carry out the plan which had been\r\narranged by Natas and Arnold an hour previously.\r\n\r\nAs the speed of the aerostat was only about twenty miles an hour\r\nagainst the wind, a rope was passed from the stern of the _Ithuriel_\r\nto the cordage connecting the car with the gas-holder, and so the\r\naerostat was taken in tow by the air-ship, and dragged through the\r\nair at a speed of about forty miles an hour, as a wind-bound sailing\r\nvessel might have been towed by a steamer.\r\n\r\nOn the journey the elevation was increased to more than four thousand\r\nfeet,--an elevation at which both the _Ithuriel_ and her captive, and\r\nespecially the former, presented practically impossible marks for the\r\nRussian riflemen. Almost immediately over Cüstrin they came to a\r\nstandstill, and then Colonel Alexandrovitch and Professor Volnow were\r\nsummoned by Natas into the deck saloon.\r\n\r\nHe explained to them the mission which he desired them to undertake,\r\nthat is to say, the conveyance of a letter from himself to the Tsar\r\noffering terms for the surrender of the _Lucifer_. They accepted the\r\nmission; and in order that they might fully understand the gravity of\r\nit, Natas read them the letter, which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n      ALEXANDER ROMANOFF,--\r\n\r\n    Three days ago one of my fleet of air-ships, named the _Lucifer_,\r\n    was delivered into your hands by traitors and deserters, whose\r\n    lives are forfeit in virtue of the oaths which they took of their\r\n    own free will. I have already taken measures to render abortive\r\n    the analysis which you ordered to be performed in the chemical\r\n    department of your Arsenal at St. Petersburg, and I have now come\r\n    to make terms, if possible, for the restoration of the air-ship.\r\n    Those terms are as follows--\r\n\r\n    An hour before daybreak this morning I captured nine of your\r\n    war-balloons, after destroying three others which attempted to\r\n    escape. I have no desire to take any present part in the war\r\n    which you are now carrying on with the Anglo-Teutonic Alliance,\r\n    and if you will tell me where the _Lucifer_ is now to be found,\r\n    and will despatch orders both by land and through Professor\r\n    Volnow, who brings this letter to you, and will return with your\r\n    answer, for her to be given up to me forthwith with everything\r\n    she has on board, and will surrender with her the four traitors\r\n    who delivered her into your hands, I will restore the nine\r\n    war-balloons to you intact, and when I have recovered the\r\n    _Lucifer_ I will take no further part in the war unless either\r\n    you or your opponents proceed to unjustifiable extremities.\r\n\r\n    If you reject these terms, or if I do not receive an answer to\r\n    this letter within two hours of the time that the bearer of it\r\n    descends in the aerostat, I shall give orders for the immediate\r\n    destruction of the war-balloons now in my hands, and I shall then\r\n    proceed to destroy Cüstrin and the other aerostats which are\r\n    moored near the town. That done I shall, for the time being,\r\n    devote the force at my disposal to the defence of Berlin, and do\r\n    my utmost to bring about the defeat and dispersal of the army\r\n    which will then no longer be commanded by yourself.\r\n\r\n    In case you may doubt what I say as to the capture of the fleet\r\n    of war-balloons, Professor Volnow will be accompanied by Colonel\r\n    Alexei Alexandrovitch, late in command of the squadron, and now\r\n    my prisoner of war.\r\n\r\n      NATAS.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors were at once transferred to the aerostat, and with a\r\nwhite flag hoisted on the after stays of the balloon she began to\r\nsink rapidly towards the earth, and at the same time Natas gave\r\norders for the _Ithuriel_ to ascend to a height of eight thousand\r\nfeet in order to frustrate any attempts that might be made, whether\r\nwith or without the orders of the Tsar, to injure her by means of a\r\nvolley from the earth.\r\n\r\nEven from that elevation, those on board the _Ithuriel_ were able\r\nwith the aid of their field-glasses to see with perfect ease the\r\ncommotion which the appearance of the air-ship with the captured\r\naerostat had produced in the Russian camp. The whole of the vast\r\nhost, numbering more than four millions of men, turned out into the\r\nopen to watch their aërial visitors, and everywhere throughout the\r\nwhole extent of the huge camp the plainest signs of the utmost\r\nexcitement were visible.\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour they saw the aerostat touch the earth near\r\nto a large building, above which floated the imperial standard of\r\nRussia. An hour had been allowed for the interview and for the Tsar\r\nto give his decision, and half an hour for the aerostat to return and\r\nmeet the air-ship.\r\n\r\nIn all the history of the world there had probably never been an hour\r\nso pregnant with tremendous consequences, not only to Europe, but to\r\nthe whole civilised world, as that was; and though apparently a\r\nperfect calm reigned throughout the air-ship, the issue of the\r\nembassy was awaited with the most intense anxiety.\r\n\r\nAnother half hour passed, and hardly a word was spoken on the deck of\r\nthe _Ithuriel_, hanging there in mid-air over the mighty Russian\r\nhost, and in range of the field-glasses of the outposts of the German\r\narmy of Berlin lying some ten or twelve miles away to the westward.\r\n\r\nIt was the calm before the threatening storm,--a storm which in less\r\nthan an hour might break in a hail of death and destruction from the\r\nsky, and turn the fields of earth into a volcano of shot and flame.\r\nCertainly the fate of an empire, and perhaps of Europe, or indeed the\r\nworld, hung in the balance over that field of possible carnage.\r\n\r\nIf the Russians regained their war-balloons and were left to\r\nthemselves, nothing that the heroic Germans could do would be likely\r\nto save Berlin from the fate that had overwhelmed Strassburg and\r\nMetz, Breslau and Thorn.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should the aerostat not return in time with a\r\nsatisfactory answer, the victorious career of the Tsar would be cut\r\nshort by such a bolt from the skies as had wrecked his fortress at\r\nKronstadt,--a blow which he could neither guard against nor return,\r\nfor it would come from an unassailable vantage point, a little vessel\r\na hundred feet long floating in the air six thousand feet from the\r\nearth, and looking a mere bright speck amidst the sunlight. She\r\nformed a mark that the most skilful rifle-shot in his army could not\r\nhit once in a thousand shots, and against whose hull of hardened\r\naluminium, bullets, even if they struck, would simply splash and\r\nscatter, like raindrops on a rock.\r\n\r\nThe remaining minutes of the last half hour were slipping away one by\r\none, and still no sign came from the earth. The aerostat remained\r\nmoored near the building surmounted by the Russian standard, and the\r\nwhite flag, which, according to arrangement, had been hauled down to\r\nbe re-hoisted if the answer of the Tsar was favourable, was still\r\ninvisible. When only ten minutes of the allotted time were left,\r\nArnold, moving his glass from his eyes, and looking at his watch,\r\nsaid to Natas--\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes more; shall I prepare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Natas. \"And let the first gun be fired with the first\r\nsecond of the eleventh minute. Destroy the aerostats first and then\r\nthe batteries of artillery. After that send a shell into Frankfort,\r\nif you have a gun that will carry the distance, so that they may see\r\nour range of operations; but spare the Tsar's headquarters for the\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" replied Arnold. Then, turning to his lieutenant, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"You have the guns loaded with No. 3, I presume, Mr. Marston, and the\r\nprojectile stands are filled, I see. Very good. Now descend to six\r\nthousand feet and go a mile to the westward. Train one broadside gun\r\non that patch of ground where you see those balloons, another to\r\nstrike in the midst of those field-guns yonder by the\r\nammunition-waggons, and train the starboard after-gun to throw a\r\nshell into Frankfort. The distance is a little over twelve miles, so\r\ngive sufficient elevation.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time these orders had been executed, swiftly as the necessary\r\nevolution had been performed, only four minutes of the allotted time\r\nwere left. Arnold took his stand by the broadside gun trained on the\r\naerostats, and, with one hand on the breech of the gun and the other\r\nholding his watch, he waited for the appointed moment. Natasha stood\r\nby him with her eyes fastened to the eye-pieces of the glasses\r\nwatching for the white flag in breathless suspense.\r\n\r\n\"One minute more!\" said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, there it goes!\" cried Natasha as the words left his lips. \"His\r\nMajesty has yielded to circumstances!\"\r\n\r\nArnold took the glasses from her, and through them saw a tiny white\r\nspeck shining against the black surface of the gas-holder of the\r\nballoon. He handed the glasses back to her, saying--\r\n\r\n\"We must not be too sure of that. His message may be one of\r\ndefiance.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Natasha. \"We shall see.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the aerostat was released from her moorings and\r\nrose swiftly and vertically into the air. As soon as it reached her\r\nown altitude the _Ithuriel_ shot forward to meet it, and stopped\r\nwithin a couple of hundred yards, a gun ready trained upon the car in\r\ncase of treachery. In the car stood Professor Volnow and Colonel\r\nAlexandrovitch. The former held something white in his hand, and\r\nacross the intervening space came the reassuring hail: \"All well!\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes he was standing on the deck of the _Ithuriel_\r\npresenting a folded paper to Natas. He was pale to the lips, and his\r\nwhole body trembled with violent emotion. As he handed him the paper,\r\nhe said to Natas in a low, husky voice that was barely recognisable\r\nas his--\r\n\r\n\"Here is the answer of the Tsar. Whether you are man or fiend, I know\r\nnot, but his Majesty has yielded and accepted your terms. May I never\r\nagain witness such anger as was his when I presented your letter. It\r\nwas not till the last moment that he yielded to my entreaties and\r\nthose of his staff, and ordered the white flag to be hoisted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Natas. \"He tempted his fate to the last moment. The\r\nguns were already trained upon Cüstrin, and thirty seconds more would\r\nhave seen his headquarters in ruins. He did wisely, if he acted\r\ntardily.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Natas broke the imperial seal. On a sheet of paper bearing\r\nthe imperial arms were scrawled three or four lines in the Autocrat's\r\nown handwriting--\r\n\r\n    I accept your main terms. The air-ship has joined the Baltic\r\n    fleet. She will be delivered to you with all on board. The four\r\n    men are my subjects, and I feel bound to protect them; they will\r\n    therefore not be delivered up. Do as you like.\r\n\r\n      ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\"A Royal answer, though it comes from a despot,\" said Natas as he\r\nrefolded the paper. \"I will waive that point, and let him protect the\r\ntraitors, if he can. Colonel Alexandrovitch,\" he continued, turning\r\nto the Russian, who had also boarded the air-ship, \"you are free. You\r\nmay return to your war-balloon, and accompany us to give the order\r\nfor the release of your squadron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free!\" suddenly screamed the Russian, his face livid and distorted\r\nwith passion. \"Free, yes, but disgraced! Ruined for life, and\r\ndegraded to the ranks! I want no freedom from you. I will not even\r\nhave my life at your hands, but I will have yours, and rid the earth\r\nof you if I die a thousand deaths!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he wrenched his sword from its scabbard, thrust the\r\nProfessor aside, and rushed at Natas with the uplifted blade. Before\r\nit had time to descend a stream of pale flame flashed over the back\r\nof the Master's chair, accompanied by a long, sharp rattle, and the\r\nRussian's body dropped instantly to the deck riddled by a hail of\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\n\"I saw murder in that man's eyes when he began to speak,\" said\r\nNatasha, putting back into her pocket the magazine pistol that she\r\nhad used with such terrible effect.\r\n\r\n\"I saw it too, daughter,\" quietly replied Natas. \"But you need not\r\nhave been afraid; the blow would never have reached me, for I would\r\nhave paralysed him before he could have made the stroke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! No man could have done it!\"\r\n\r\nThe exclamation burst involuntarily from the lips of Professor\r\nVolnow, who had stood by, an amazed and horrified spectator of the\r\nrapidly enacted tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"Professor,\" said Natas, in quick, stern tones, \"I am not accustomed\r\nto say what is not true, nor yet to be contradicted by any one in\r\nhuman shape. Stand there till I tell you to move.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these last words Natas made a swift, sweeping downward\r\nmovement with one of his hands, and fixed his eyes upon those of the\r\nProfessor. In an instant Volnow's muscles stiffened into immovable\r\nrigidity, and he stood rooted to the deck powerless to move so much\r\nas a finger.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Arnold,\" continued Natas, as though nothing had happened.\r\n\"We will rejoin our consorts, please, and release the aerostats in\r\naccordance with the terms. This man's body will be returned in one of\r\nthem to his master, and the Professor here will write an account of\r\nhis death in order that it may not be believed that we have murdered\r\nhim. Konstantin Volnow, go into the saloon and write that letter, and\r\nbring it to me when it is done.\"\r\n\r\nLike an automaton the Professor turned and walked mechanically into\r\nthe deck-saloon. Meanwhile the _Ithuriel_ started on her way towards\r\nthe captive squadron. Before she reached it Volnow returned with a\r\nsheet of paper in his hand filled with fresh writing, and signed with\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nNatas took it from him, read it, and then fixing his eyes on his\r\nagain, said--\r\n\r\n\"That will do. I give you back your will. Now, do you believe?\"\r\n\r\nThe Professor's body was suddenly shaken with such a violent\r\ntrembling that he almost fell to the deck. Then he recovered himself\r\nwith a violent effort, and cried through his chattering teeth--\r\n\r\n\"Believe! How can I help it? Whoever and whatever you are, you are\r\nwell named the Master of the Terror.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nAT CLOSE QUARTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the captive war-balloons had been released, the _Ithuriel_\r\nand her consorts, without any further delay or concern for the issue\r\nof the decisive battle which would probably prove to be the\r\ndeath-struggle of the German Empire, headed away to the northward at\r\nthe utmost speed of the two smaller vessels. Their objective point\r\nwas Copenhagen, and the distance rather more than two hundred and\r\nsixty miles in a straight line.\r\n\r\nThis was covered in under two hours and a half, and by noon they had\r\nreached the Danish capital. In crossing the water from Stralsund they\r\nhad sighted several war-vessels, all flying British, German, or\r\nDanish colours, and all making a northerly course like themselves.\r\nThey had not attempted to speak to any of these, because, as they\r\nwere all apparently bound for the same point, and, as the speed of\r\nthe air-ships was more than five times as great as that of the\r\nswiftest cruiser, to do so would have been a waste of time, when\r\nevery moment might be of the utmost consequence.\r\n\r\nOff Copenhagen the aërial travellers saw the first signs of the\r\nterrible night's work, with the details of which the reader has\r\nalready been made acquainted. Wrecked fortifications, cruisers and\r\nbattleships bearing every mark of a heavy engagement, some with their\r\ntop-works battered into ruins, their military masts gone, and their\r\nguns dismounted; some down by the head, and some by the stern, and\r\nothers evidently run ashore to save them from sinking; and the\r\nharbour crowded with others in little better condition--everywhere\r\nthere were eloquent proofs of the disaster which had overtaken the\r\nAllied fleets on the previous night.\r\n\r\n\"There seems to have been some rough work going on down there within\r\nthe last few hours,\" said Arnold to Natas as they came in sight of\r\nthis scene of destruction. \"The Russians could not have done this\r\nalone, for when the war began they were shut up in the Baltic by an\r\noverwhelming force, of which these seem to be the remains. And those\r\nforts yonder were never destroyed by anything but our shells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Natas. \"It is easy to see what has happened. The\r\n_Lucifer_ was sent here to help the Russian fleet to break the\r\nblockade, and it looks as though it had been done very effectually.\r\nWe are just a few hours too late, I fear.\r\n\r\n\"That one victory will have an immense effect on the course of the\r\nwar, for it is almost certain that the Russians will make for the\r\nAtlantic round the north of the Shetland Islands, and co-operate with\r\nthe French and Italian squadrons along the British line of\r\ncommunication with the West. That once cut, food will go up to famine\r\nprices in Britain, and the end will not be far off.\"\r\n\r\nNatas spoke without the slightest apparent personal interest in the\r\nsubject; but his words brought a flush to Arnold's cheeks, and make\r\nhim suddenly clench his hands and knit his brows. After all he was an\r\nEnglishman, and though he owed England nothing but the accident of\r\nhis birth, the knowledge that one of his own ships should be the\r\nmeans of bringing this disaster upon her made him forget for the\r\nmoment the gulf that he had placed between himself and his native\r\nland, and long to go to her rescue. But it was only a passing\r\nemotion. He remembered that his country was now elsewhere, and that\r\nall his hopes were now alien to Britain and her fortunes.\r\n\r\nIf Natas noticed the effect of his words he made no sign that he did,\r\nand he went on in the same even tone as before--\r\n\r\n\"We must overtake the fleet, and either recapture the _Lucifer_ or\r\ndestroy her before she does any more mischief in Russian hands. The\r\nfirst thing to do is to find out what has happened, and what course\r\nthey have taken. Hoist the Union Jack over a flag of truce on all\r\nthree ships, and signal to Mazanoff to come alongside. We had better\r\nstop here till we get the news.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master's orders were at once executed, and as soon as the _Ariel_\r\nwas floating beside the flagship he said to her captain--\r\n\r\n\"Go down and speak that cruiser lying at anchor off the harbour, and\r\nlearn all you can of what has happened. Tell them freely how it\r\nhappened that the _Lucifer_ assisted the Russian, if it turns out\r\nthat she did so. Say that we have no hostility to Britain at present,\r\nbut rather the reverse, and that our only purpose just now is to\r\nretake the air-ship and prevent her doing any more damage. If you can\r\nget any newspapers, do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand fully,\" replied Mazanoff, and a minute later his vessel\r\nwas sinking rapidly down towards the cruiser.\r\n\r\nHis reception was evidently friendly, for those on board the\r\n_Ithuriel_ saw that he ran the _Ariel_ close alongside the\r\nman-of-war, after the first hails had been exchanged, and conversed\r\nfor some time with a group of officers across the rails of the two\r\nvessels. Then a large roll of newspapers was passed from the cruiser\r\nto the air-ship, salutes were exchanged, and the _Ariel_ rose\r\ngracefully into the air to rejoin her consorts, followed by the\r\nenvious glances of the crews of the battered warships.\r\n\r\nMazanoff presented his report, the facts of which were substantially\r\nthose given in the _St. James's Gazette_ telegram, and added that the\r\nBritish officers had confessed to him that the damage done was so\r\ngreat, both to the fleet and the shore fortifications, that the Sound\r\nwas now practically as open as the Atlantic, and that it would be two\r\nor three weeks before even half the Allied force would be able to\r\ntake the sea in fighting trim.\r\n\r\nThey added that there was not the slightest need to conceal their\r\ncondition, as the Russians, who had steamed in triumph past their\r\nshattered ships and silenced forts, knew it just as well as they did.\r\nAs regards the Russian fleet, it had been followed past the Skawe,\r\nand had headed out westward.\r\n\r\nIn their opinion it would consider itself strong enough, with the aid\r\nof the air-ship, to sweep the North Sea, and would probably attempt\r\nto force the Straits of Dover, as it has done the Sound, and effect a\r\njunction with the French squadrons at Brest and Cherbourg. This done,\r\na combined attack might possibly be made upon Portsmouth, or the\r\ndestruction of the Channel fleet attempted. The effects of the\r\nair-ship's shells upon both forts and ships had been so appalling\r\nthat the Russians would no doubt think themselves strong enough for\r\nanything as long as they had possession of her.\r\n\r\n\"They were extremely polite,\" said Mazanoff, as he concluded his\r\nstory. \"They asked me to go ashore and interview the Admiral, who,\r\nthey told me, would guarantee any amount of money on behalf of the\r\nBritish Government if we would only co-operate with their fleets for\r\neven a month. They said Britain would gladly pay a hundred thousand a\r\nmonth for the hire of each ship and her crew; and they looked quite\r\npuzzled when I refused point-blank, and said that a million a month\r\nwould not do it.\r\n\r\n\"They evidently take us for a new sort of pirates, corsairs of the\r\nair, or something of that kind; for when I said that a few odd\r\nmillions were no good to people who could levy blackmail on the whole\r\nearth if they chose, they stared at me and asked me what we did want\r\nif we didn't want money. The idea that we could have any higher aims\r\nnever seemed to have entered their heads, and, of course, I didn't\r\nenlighten them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" said Natas, with a quiet laugh. \"They will learn our\r\naims quite soon enough. And now we must overtake the Russian fleet as\r\nsoon as possible. You say they passed the Skawe soon after five this\r\nmorning. That gives them nearly six hours' start, and if they are\r\nsteaming twenty miles an hour, as I daresay they are, they will now\r\nbe some hundred and twenty miles west of the Skawe. Captain Arnold,\r\nif we cut straight across Zeeland and Jutland, about what distance\r\nought we to travel before we meet them?\"\r\n\r\nArnold glanced at the chart which lay spread out on the table of the\r\nsaloon in which they were sitting, and said--\r\n\r\n\"I should say a course of about two hundred miles due north-west from\r\nhere ought to take us within sight of them, unless they are making\r\nfor the Atlantic, and keep very close to the Swedish coast. In that\r\ncase I should say two hundred and fifty in the same direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, let us take that course and make all the speed we\r\ncan,\" said Natas; and within ten minutes the three vessels were\r\nspeeding away to the north-westward at a hundred and twenty miles an\r\nhour over the verdant lowlands of the Danish peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe _Ithuriel_ kept above five miles ahead of the others, and when\r\nthe journey had lasted about an hour and three-quarters, the man who\r\nhad been stationed in the conning-tower signalled, \"Fleet in sight\"\r\nto the saloon. The air-ships were then travelling at an elevation of\r\n3000 feet. A good ten miles to the northward could be seen the\r\nRussian fleet steering to the westward, and, judging by the dense\r\nclouds of smoke that were pouring out of the funnels of the vessels,\r\nmaking all the speed they could.\r\n\r\nArnold, who had gone forward to the conning-tower as soon as the\r\nsignal sounded, at once returned to the saloon and made his formal\r\nreport to Natas.\r\n\r\n\"The Russian fleet is in sight, heading to the westward, and\r\ntherefore evidently meaning to reach the Atlantic by the north of the\r\nShetlands. There are twelve large battleships, about twenty-five\r\ncruisers of different sizes, eight of them very large, and a small\r\nswarm of torpedo-boats being towed by the larger vessels, I suppose\r\nto save their coal. I see no signs of the _Lucifer_ at present, but\r\nfrom what we have learnt she will be on the deck of one of the large\r\ncruisers. What are your orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Recover the air-ship if you can,\" replied Natas. \"Send Mazanoff with\r\nProfessor Volnow to convey the Tsar's letter to the Admiral, and\r\ndemand the surrender of the _Lucifer_. If he refuses, let the _Ariel_\r\nreturn at once, and we will decide what to do. I leave the details\r\nwith you with the most perfect confidence.\"\r\n\r\nArnold bowed in silence and retired, catching, as he turned to leave\r\nthe saloon, a glance from Natasha which, it must be confessed, meant\r\nmore to him than even the command of the Master. From the expression\r\nof his face as he went to the wheel-house to take charge of the ship,\r\nit was evident that it would go hard with the Russian fleet if the\r\nAdmiral refused to recognise the order of the Tsar.\r\n\r\nWhen he got to the wheel-house the _Ithuriel_ was almost over the\r\nfleet. He signalled \"stop\" to the engine-room. Immediately the\r\npropellers slowed and then ceased their rapid revolutions, and at the\r\nsame time the fan-wheels went aloft and began to revolve. This was a\r\nprearranged signal to the others to do the same, and by the time they\r\nhad overtaken the flagship they also came to a standstill. As soon as\r\nthey were within speaking distance Arnold hailed the _Orion_ and the\r\n_Ariel_ to come alongside.\r\n\r\nAfter communicating to Tremayne and Mazanoff the orders of Natas, he\r\nsaid to the latter--\r\n\r\n\"You will take Professor Volnow to present the Tsar's letter to the\r\nAdmiral in command of the fleet. Fly the Russian flag over a flag of\r\ntruce, and if he acknowledges it say that if the _Lucifer_ is given\r\nup we shall allow the fleet to go on its way unmolested and without\r\nasking any question.\r\n\r\n\"The cruiser that has her on board must separate from the rest of the\r\nfleet and allow two of your men to take possession of her and bring\r\nher up here. The lives of the four traitors are safe for the present\r\nif the air-ship is given up quietly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they will not recognise the authority of the Tsar's letter,\r\nand refuse to give the air-ship up, what then?\" asked Mazanoff.\r\n\r\n\"In that case haul down the Russian flag, and get aloft as quickly as\r\nyou can. You can leave the rest to us,\" said Arnold. \"Meanwhile,\r\nTremayne, will you go down to two thousand feet or so, and keep your\r\neye on that big cruiser a bit ahead of the rest of the fleet. I fancy\r\nI can make out the _Lucifer_ on her deck. Train a couple of guns on\r\nher, and don't let the air-ship rise without orders. I shall stop up\r\nhere for the present, and be ready to make things lively for the\r\nAdmiral if he refuses to obey his master's orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Ariel_ took the Professor on board, and hoisted the Russian\r\ncolours over the flag of truce, and began to sink down towards the\r\nfleet. As she descended, the Admiral in command of the squadron,\r\nalready not a little puzzled by the appearance of the three\r\nair-ships, was still more mystified by seeing the Russian ensign\r\nflying from her flagstaff.\r\n\r\nWas this only a ruse of the Terrorists, or were they flying the\r\nRussian flag for a legitimate reason? As he knew from the experience\r\nof the previous night that the air-ships, if their intentions were\r\nhostile, could destroy his fleet in detail without troubling to\r\nparley with him, he concluded that there was a good reason for the\r\nflag of truce, and so he ordered one to be flown from his own\r\nmasthead in answer to it.\r\n\r\nThe white flag at once enabled Mazanoff to single out the huge\r\nbattleship on which it was flying as the Admiral's flagship. The\r\nfleet was proceeding in four columns of line abreast. First two long\r\nlines of cruisers, each with one or two torpedo boats in tow, and\r\nwith scouts thrown out on each wing, and then two lines of\r\nbattleships, in the centre of the first of which was the flagship.\r\n\r\nIt was a somewhat risky matter for the _Ariel_ to descend thus right\r\nin the middle of the whole fleet, but Mazanoff had his orders, and\r\nthey had to be obeyed, and so down he went, running his bow up to\r\nwithin a hundred feet of the hurricane deck, on which stood the\r\nAdmiral surrounded by several of his officers.\r\n\r\n\"I have a message for the Admiral of the fleet,\" he shouted, as soon\r\nas he came within hail.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, and from whom is your message?\" came the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Konstantin Volnow, of the Imperial Arsenal at Petersburg, brings the\r\nmessage from the Tsar in writing.'\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty's messenger is welcome. Come alongside.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Ariel_ ran ahead until her prow touched the rail of the\r\nhurricane deck, and the Professor advanced with the Tsar's letter in\r\nhis hand, and gave it to the Admiral, saying--\r\n\r\n\"You are acquainted with me, Admiral Prabylov. Though I bear it\r\nunwillingly, I can vouch for the letter being authentic. I saw his\r\nMajesty write it, and he gave it into my hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you come to be an unwilling bearer of it?\" asked the\r\nAdmiral, scowling and gnawing his moustache as he read the unwelcome\r\nletter. \"What are these terms, and with whom were they made?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Admiral,\" interrupted Mazanoff, \"that is not the\r\nquestion. I presume you recognise his Majesty's signature, and see\r\nthat he desires the air-ship to be given up.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty's signature can be forged, just as Nihilists' passports\r\ncan be, Mr. Terrorist, for that's what I presume you are, and\"--\r\n\r\n\"Admiral, I solemnly assure you that that letter is genuine, and that\r\nit is really his Majesty's wish that the air-ship should be given\r\nup,\" the Professor broke in before Mazanoff had time to reply. \"It is\r\nto be given in exchange for nine war-balloons which these air-ships\r\ncaptured before daybreak this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you come to be the bearer of it, sir? Please answer me that\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a prisoner of war. I surrendered to save the Arsenal and\r\nperhaps Petersburg from destruction under circumstances which I\r\ncannot now explain\"--\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir, that is quite enough! A pretty story, truly! And you\r\nask me to believe this, and to give up that priceless air-ship on\r\nsuch grounds as these--a story that would hardly deceive a child? You\r\ncaptured nine of the Tsar's war-balloons this morning, had an\r\ninterview with his Majesty, got this letter from him at Cüstrin--more\r\nthan five hundred miles away, and bring it here, and it is barely two\r\nin the afternoon!\r\n\r\n\"No, gentlemen, I am too old a sailor to be taken in by a yarn like\r\nthat. I believe this letter to be a forgery, and I will not give the\r\nair-ship up on its authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your last word, is it?\" asked Mazanoff, white with passion,\r\nbut still forcing himself to speak coolly.\r\n\r\n\"That is my last word, sir, save to tell you that if you do not haul\r\nthat flag you are masquerading under down at once I will fire upon\r\nyou,\" shouted the Admiral, tearing the Tsar's letter into fragments\r\nas he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"If I haul that flag down it will be the signal for the air-ships up\r\nyonder to open fire upon you, so your blood be on your own heads!\"\r\nsaid Mazanoff, stamping thrice on the deck as he spoke. The\r\npropellers of the _Ariel_ whirled round in a reverse direction, and\r\nshe sprang swiftly back from the battleship, at the same time rising\r\nrapidly in the air.\r\n\r\nBefore she had cleared a hundred yards, and before the flag of truce\r\nwas hauled down, there was a sharp, grinding report from one of the\r\ntops of the man-of-war, and a hail of bullets from a machine gun\r\nswept across the deck. Mazanoff heard a splintering of wood and\r\nglass, and a deep groan beside him. He looked round and saw the\r\nProfessor clasp his hand to a great red wound in his breast, and fall\r\nin a heap on the deck.\r\n\r\nThis was the event of an instant. The next he had trained one of the\r\nbow-guns downwards on the centre of the deck of the Russian flagship\r\nand sent the projectile to its mark. Then quick as thought he sprang\r\nover and discharged the other gun almost at random. He saw the\r\ndazzling green flash of the explosions, then came a shaking of the\r\natmosphere, and a roar as of a hundred thunder-claps in his ears, and\r\nhe dropped senseless to the deck beside the corpse of the Professor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"There was a sharp, grinding report from one of the\r\ntops of the man-of-war.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 232._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nA RUSSIAN RAID.\r\n\r\n\r\nMazanoff came to himself about ten minutes later, lying on one of the\r\nseats in the after saloon, and all that he saw when he first opened\r\nhis eyes was the white anxious face of Radna bending over him.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter? What has happened? Where am I?\" he asked, as\r\nsoon as his tongue obeyed his will. His voice, although broken and\r\nunsteady, was almost as strong as usual, and Radna's face immediately\r\nbrightened as she heard it. A smile soon chased away her anxious\r\nlook, and she said cheerily--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, come! you're not killed after all. You are still on board the\r\n_Ariel_, and what has happened is this as far as I can see. In your\r\nhurry to return the shot from the Russian flagship you fired your\r\nguns at too close range, and the shock of the explosion stunned you.\r\nIn fact, we thought for the moment you had blown the _Ariel_ up too,\r\nfor she shook so that we all fell down; then her engines stopped, and\r\nshe almost fell into the water before they could be started again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she all right now? Where's the Russian fleet, and what happened\r\nto the flagship? I must get on deck,\" exclaimed Mazanoff, sitting up\r\non the seat. As he did so he put his hand to his head and said: \"I\r\nfeel a bit shaky still. What's that--brandy you've got there? Get me\r\nsome champagne, and put the brandy into it. I shall be all right when\r\nI've had a good drink. Now I think of it, I wonder that explosion\r\ndidn't blow us to bits. You haven't told me what became of the\r\nflagship,\" he continued, as Radna came back with a small bottle of\r\nchampagne and uncorked it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the flagship is at the bottom of the German Ocean. When\r\nPetroff told me that you had fallen dead, as he said, on deck, I ran\r\nup in defiance of your orders and saw the battleship just going down.\r\nThe shells had blown the middle of her right out, and a cloud of\r\nsteam and smoke and fire was rising out of a great ragged space where\r\nthe funnels had been. Before I got you down here she broke right in\r\ntwo and went down.\"\r\n\r\n\"That serves that blackguard Prabylov right for saying we forged the\r\nTsar's letter, and firing on a flag of truce. Poor Volnow's dead, I\r\nsuppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" replied Radna sadly. \"He was shot almost to pieces by the\r\nvolley from the machine gun. The deck saloon is riddled with bullets,\r\nand the decks badly torn up, but fortunately the hull and propellers\r\nare almost uninjured. But come, drink this, then you can go up and\r\nsee for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying she handed him a tumbler of champagne well dashed with\r\nbrandy. He drank it down at a gulp, like the Russian that he was, and\r\nsaid as he put the glass down--\r\n\r\n\"That's better. I feel a new man. Now give me a kiss, _batiushka_,\r\nand I'll be off.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the deck he found the _Ariel_ ascending towards the\r\n_Ithuriel_, and about a mile astern of the Russian fleet, the vessels\r\nof which were blazing away into the air with their machine guns, in\r\nthe hope of \"bringing him down on the wing,\" as he afterwards put it.\r\nHe could hear the bullets singing along underneath him; but the\r\n_Ariel_ was rising so fast, and going at such a speed through the\r\nair, that the moment the Russians got the range they lost it again,\r\nand so merely wasted their ammunition.\r\n\r\nNeither the _Ithuriel_ nor the _Orion_ seemed to have taken any part\r\nin the battle so far, or to have done anything to avenge the attack\r\nmade upon the _Ariel_. Mazanoff wondered not a little at this, as\r\nboth Arnold and Tremayne must have seen the fate of the Russian\r\nflagship. As soon as he got within speaking distance of the\r\n_Ithuriel_, he sang out to Arnold, who was on the deck--\r\n\r\n\"I got in rather a tight place down there. That scoundrel fired upon\r\nus with the flag of truce flying, and when I gave him a couple of\r\nshells in return I thought the end of the world was come.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fired at too close range, my friend. Those shells are sudden\r\ndeath to anything within a hundred yards of them. Are you all well on\r\nboard? You've been knocked about a bit, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; poor Volnow's dead. He was killed standing close beside me, and\r\nI wasn't touched, though the explosion of the shell knocked the\r\nsenses out of me completely. However, the machinery's all right, and\r\nI don't think the hull is hurt to speak of. But what are you doing? I\r\nshould have thought you'd have blown half the fleet out of the water\r\nby this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We saw that you had amply avenged yourself, and the Master's\r\norders were not to do anything till you returned. You'd better come\r\non board and consult with him.\"\r\n\r\nMazanoff did so, and when he had told his story to Natas, the latter\r\nmystified him not a little by replying--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that none of you are injured, though, of course, I'm sorry\r\nthat I sent Volnow to his death; but that is the fortune of war. If\r\none of us fell into his master's hands his fate would be worse than\r\nthat. You avenged the outrage promptly and effectively.\r\n\r\n\"I have decided not to injure the Russian fleet more than I can help.\r\nIt has work to do which must not be interfered with. My only object\r\nis to recover the _Lucifer_, if possible, and so we shall follow the\r\nfleet for the present across the North Sea on our way to the\r\nrendezvous with the other vessels from Aeria which are to meet us on\r\nRockall Island, and wait our opportunity. Should the opportunity not\r\ncome before then, we must proceed to extremities, and destroy her and\r\nthe cruiser that has her on board.\r\n\r\n\"And do you think we shall get such an opportunity?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Natas. \"But it is possible. I don't think it\r\nlikely that the fleet will have coal enough for a long cruise in the\r\nAtlantic, and therefore it is possible that they will make a descent\r\non Aberdeen, which they are quite strong enough to capture if they\r\nlike, and coal up there. In that case it is extremely probable that\r\nthey will make use of the air-ship to terrorise the town into\r\nsurrender, and as soon as she takes the air we must make a dash for\r\nher, and either take her or blow her to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nArnold expressed his entire agreement with this idea, and, as the\r\nevent proved, it was entirely correct. Instead of steering\r\nnor'-nor'-west, as they would have done had they intended to go round\r\nthe Shetland Islands, or north-west, had they chosen the course\r\nbetween the Orkneys and the Shetlands, the Russian vessels kept a due\r\nwesterly course during the rest of the day, and this course could\r\nonly take them to the Scotch coast near Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nThe distance from where they were was a little under five hundred\r\nmiles, and at their present rate of steaming they would reach\r\nAberdeen about four o'clock on the following afternoon. The air-ships\r\nfollowed them at a height of four thousand feet during the rest of\r\nthe day and until shortly before dawn on the following morning.\r\n\r\nThey then put on speed, took a wide sweep to the northward, and\r\nreturned southward over Banffshire, and passing Aberdeen to the west,\r\nfound a secluded resting-place on the northern spur of the\r\nKincardineshire Hills, about five miles to the southward of the\r\nGranite City.\r\n\r\nHere the repairs which were needed by the _Ariel_ were at once taken\r\nin hand by her own crew and that of the _Ithuriel_, while the _Orion_\r\nwas sent out to sea again to keep a sharp look-out for the Russian\r\nfleet, which she would sight long before she herself became visible,\r\nand then to watch the movements of the Russians from as great a\r\ndistance as possible until it was time to make the counter-attack.\r\n\r\nAs Aberdeen was then one of the coaling depots for the North Sea\r\nSquadron, it was defended by two battleships, the _Ascalon_ and the\r\n_Menelaus_, three powerful coast-defence vessels, the _Thunderer_,\r\nthe _Cyclops_, and the _Pluto_, six cruisers, and twelve\r\ntorpedo-boats. The shore defences consisted of a fort on the north\r\nbank at the mouth of the Dee, mounting ten heavy guns, and the\r\nGirdleness fort, mounting twenty-four 9-inch twenty-five ton guns, in\r\nconnection with which was a station for working navigable torpedoes\r\nof the Brennan type, which had been considerably improved during the\r\nlast ten years.\r\n\r\nShortly after two o'clock on the afternoon of the 30th the _Orion_\r\nreturned to her consorts with the news that the Russian fleet was\r\nforty miles off the land, heading straight for Aberdeen, and that\r\nthere were no other warships in sight as far as could be seen to the\r\nsouthward. From this fact it was concluded that the Russians had\r\nescaped the notice of the North Sea Squadron, and so would only have\r\nthe force defending Aberdeen to reckon with.\r\n\r\nEven had they not possessed the air-ship, this force was so far\r\ninferior to their own that there would be little chance of\r\nsuccessfully defending the town against them. They had eleven\r\nbattleships, twenty-five cruisers, eight of which were very large and\r\nheavily armed, and forty torpedo-boats, to pit against the little\r\nBritish force and the two forts.\r\n\r\nBut given the assistance of the _Lucifer_, and the town practically\r\nlay at their mercy. They evidently feared no serious opposition in\r\ntheir raid, for, without even waiting for nightfall, they came on at\r\nfull speed, darkening the sky with their smoke, the battleships in\r\nthe centre, a dozen cruisers on either side of them, and one large\r\ncruiser about a mile ahead of their centre.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain of the _Ascalon_, who was in command of the port,\r\nsaw the overwhelming force of the hostile fleet, he at once came to\r\nthe conclusion that it would be madness for him to attempt to put to\r\nsea with his eleven ships and six torpedo-boats. The utmost that he\r\ncould do was to remain inshore and assist the forts to keep the\r\nRussians at bay, if possible, until the assistance, which had already\r\nbeen telegraphed for to Dundee and the Firth of Forth, where the bulk\r\nof the North Sea Squadron was then stationed, could come to his aid.\r\n\r\nFive miles off the land the Russian fleet stopped, and the _Lucifer_\r\nrose from the deck of the big cruiser and stationed herself about a\r\nmile to seaward of the mouth of the river at an elevation of three\r\nthousand feet. Then a torpedo-boat flying a flag of truce shot out\r\nfrom the Russian line and ran to within a mile of the shore.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore of the port sent out one of his torpedo-boats to meet\r\nher, and this craft brought back a summons to surrender the port for\r\ntwelve hours, and permit six of the Russian cruisers to fill up with\r\ncoal. The alternative would be bombardment of the town by the fleet\r\nand the air-ship, which alone, as the Russians said, held the fort\r\nand the ships at its mercy.\r\n\r\nTo this demand the British Commodore sent back a flat refusal, and\r\ndefiance to the Russian Commander to do his worst.\r\n\r\nWhere the _Ithuriel_ and her consorts were lying the hills between\r\nthem and the sea completely screened them from the observation of\r\nthose on board the _Lucifer_. Arnold and Tremayne had climbed to the\r\ntop of a hill above their ships, and watched the movements of the\r\nRussians through their glasses. As soon as they saw the _Lucifer_\r\nrise into the air they returned to the _Ithuriel_ to form their plans\r\nfor their share in the conflict that they saw impending.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we can't do much until it gets a good deal darker than it\r\nis now,\" said Arnold, in reply to a question from Natas as to his\r\nview of the situation. \"If we take the air now the _Lucifer_ will see\r\nus; and we must remember that she is armed with the same weapons as\r\nwe have, and a shot from one of her guns would settle any of us that\r\nit struck. Even if we hit her first we should destroy her, and we\r\ncould have done that easily yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"It has felt very like thunder all day, and I see there are some very\r\nblack-looking clouds rolling up there over the hills to the\r\nsouth-west. My advice is to wait for those. I'm afraid we can't do\r\nanything to save the town under the circumstances, but in this state\r\nof the atmosphere a heavy bombardment is practically certain to bring\r\non a severe thunderstorm, and to fetch those clouds up at the double\r\nquick.\r\n\r\n\"I don't for a moment think that the British will surrender, big and\r\nall as the Russian force is, and as they have never seen the effects\r\nof our shells they won't fear the _Lucifer_ much until she commences\r\noperations, and then it will be too late. Listen! They've begun.\r\nThere goes the first gun!\"\r\n\r\nA deep, dull boom came rolling up the hills from the sea as he spoke,\r\nand was almost immediately followed by a rapid series of similar\r\nreports, which quickly deepened into a continuous roar. Every one who\r\ncould be spared from the air-ship at once ran up to the top of the\r\nhill to watch the progress of the fight. The Russian fleet had\r\nadvanced to within three miles of the land, and had opened a furious\r\ncannonade on the British ships and the forts, which were manfully\r\nreplying to it with every available gun.\r\n\r\nBy the time the watchers on the hill had focussed their glasses on\r\nthe scene, the _Lucifer_ discharged her first shell on the fort on\r\nGirdleness. They saw the blaze of the explosion gleam through the\r\nsmoke that already hung thick over the low building. Another and\r\nanother followed in quick succession, and the firing from the fort\r\nceased. The smoke drifted slowly away, and disclosed a heap of\r\nshapeless ruins.\r\n\r\n\"That is horrible work, isn't it?\" said Arnold to Tremayne through\r\nhis clenched teeth. \"Anywhere but on British ground would not be so\r\nbad, but the sight of that makes my blood boil. I would give my ears\r\nto take our ships into the air, and smash up that Russian fleet as we\r\ndid the French Squadron in the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n\"There spoke the true Briton, Captain Arnold,\" said Natasha, who was\r\nstanding beside him under a clump of trees. \"Yes, I can quite\r\nunderstand how you feel watching a scene like that, for country is\r\ncountry after all. Even my half-English blood is pretty near boiling\r\npoint; and though I wouldn't give my ears, I would give a good deal\r\nto go with you and do as you say.\r\n\r\n\"But you may rest assured that the Master's way is the best, and will\r\nprove the shortest road to the universal peace which can only come\r\nthrough universal war. Courage, my friend, and patience! There will\r\nbe a heavy reckoning to pay for this sort of thing one day, and that\r\nbefore very long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Tremayne. \"There goes the other fort. I suppose it\r\nwill be the turn of the ships next. What a frightful scene! Twenty\r\nminutes ago it was as peaceful as these hills, and look at it now.\"\r\n\r\nThe second fort had been destroyed as rapidly as the first, and the\r\ncessation of the fire of both had made a very perceptible difference\r\nin the cannonade, though the great guns of the Russian fleet still\r\nroared continuously and poured a hurricane of shot and shell into the\r\nmouth of the river across which the British ships were drawn, keeping\r\nup the unequal conflict like so many bull-dogs at bay.\r\n\r\nOver them and the river hung a dense pall of bluish-white smoke,\r\nthrough which the _Lucifer_ sent projectile after projectile in the\r\nattempt to sink the British ironclads. As those on board her could\r\nonly judge by the flash of the guns, the aim was very imperfect, and\r\nseveral projectiles were wasted, falling into the sea and exploding\r\nthere, throwing up mountains of water, but not doing any further\r\ndamage. At length a brilliant green flash shot up through the smoke\r\nclouds over the river mouth.\r\n\r\n\"He's hit one of the ships at last!\" exclaimed Tremayne, as he saw\r\nthe flash. \"It'll soon be all up with poor old Aberdeen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" exclaimed Arnold. \"At any rate the _Lucifer_\r\nwon't do much more harm. There comes the storm at last! Back to the\r\nships all of you at once, it's time to go aloft!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a brilliant flash of lightning split the inky clouds\r\nwhich had now risen high over the western hills, and a deep roll of\r\nthunder came echoing up the valleys as if in answer to the roar of\r\nthe cannonade on the sea. The moment every one was on board, Arnold\r\ngave the signal to ascend. As soon as the fan-wheels had raised them\r\na hundred feet from the ground he gave the signal for full speed\r\nahead, and the three air-ships swept upwards to the west as though to\r\nmeet the coming storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE CHASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flight of the _Ithuriel_ and her consorts was so graduated, that\r\nas they rose to the level of the storm-cloud they missed it and\r\npassed diagonally beyond it at a sufficient distance to avoid\r\ndisturbing the electrical balance between it and the earth. The\r\nobject of doing so was not so much to escape a discharge of\r\nelectricity, since all the vital parts of the machinery and the\r\npower-cylinders were carefully insulated, but rather in order not to\r\nprovoke a lightning flash which might have revealed their rapid\r\npassage to the occupants of the _Lucifer_.\r\n\r\nAs it was, they swept upwards and westward at such a speed that they\r\nhad gained the cover of the thunder-cloud, and placed a considerable\r\narea of it between themselves and the town, long before the storm\r\nbroke over Aberdeen, and so they were provided with ample shelter\r\nunder, or rather over, which they were to make their attack on the\r\n_Lucifer_.\r\n\r\nThey waited until the clouds coming up from the westward joined those\r\nwhich had begun to gather thick and black and threatening over the\r\nRussian fleet soon after the tremendous cannonade had begun. The\r\nshock of the meeting of the two cloud-squadrons formed a fitting\r\ncounterpart to the drama of death and destruction that was being\r\nplayed on land and sea.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant sunshine of the midsummer afternoon was suddenly\r\nobscured by a darkness born of smoke and cloud like that of a\r\nmidwinter night. The smoke of the cannonade rose heavily and mingled\r\nwith the clouds, and the atmospheric concussions produced by the\r\ndischarge of hundreds of heavy guns, brought down the rain in\r\ntorrents. Almost continuous streams of lightning flashed from cloud\r\nto cloud, and from heaven to earth, eclipsing the spouting fire of\r\nthe guns, while to the roar of the bombardment was added an almost\r\nunbroken roll of thunder.\r\n\r\nAbove all this hideous turmoil of human and elemental strife, the\r\nthree air-ships floated for awhile in a serene and sunlit atmosphere.\r\nBut this was only for a time. Arnold had taken the position and\r\naltitude of the _Lucifer_ very carefully by means of his sextant and\r\ncompass before he rose into the air, and as soon as his preparations\r\nwere complete he made another observation of the angle of the sun's\r\nelevation, allowing, of course, for his own, and placed his three\r\nships as nearly perpendicular as he could over the _Lucifer_,\r\nfloating on the under side of the storm-cloud.\r\n\r\nHis preparations had been simple in the extreme. Four light strong\r\ngrappling-irons hung downwards from the _Ithuriel_, two at the bow\r\nand two at the stern, by thin steel-wire rope; two similar ones hung\r\nfrom the starboard side of the _Orion_, which was on his left hand,\r\nand two from the port side of the _Ariel_, which was on his right\r\nhand. As they gained the desired position, a man was stationed at\r\neach of the ropes, with instructions how to act when the word was\r\ngiven. Then the fan-wheels were slowed down, and the three vessels\r\nsank swiftly through the cloud.\r\n\r\nThrough the mist and darkness underneath they saw the white shape of\r\nthe _Lucifer_ almost immediately below them, so accurately had the\r\nposition been determined. They sank a hundred feet farther, and then\r\nArnold shouted--\r\n\r\n\"Now is your time. Cast!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the eight grappling-irons dropped and swung towards the\r\n_Lucifer_, hooking themselves in the stays of her masts and the\r\nrailing that ran completely round her deck.\r\n\r\n\"Now, up again, and ahead!\" shouted Arnold once more, and the\r\nfan-wheels of the three ships revolved at their utmost speed; the\r\nair-planes had already been inclined to the full, the nine propellers\r\nwhirled round, and the recaptured _Lucifer_ was dragged forward and\r\nupwards through the mist and darkness of the thunder-cloud into the\r\nbright sunshine above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Now is your time, cast!\"\r\n\r\n_See page 242._]\r\n\r\nSo suddenly had the strange manoeuvre been executed that those on\r\nboard her had not time to grasp what had really happened to them\r\nbefore they found themselves captured and utterly helpless. As she\r\nhung below her three captors it was impossible to bring one of the\r\n_Lucifer's_ guns to bear upon them, while four guns, two from the\r\n_Ariel_ and two from the _Orion_, grinned down upon her ready to blow\r\nher into fragments at the least sign of resistance.\r\n\r\nAdded to this, a dozen magazine rifles covered her deck, threatening\r\nsudden death to the six bewildered men who were still staring\r\nhelplessly about them in wonderment at the strange thing that had\r\nhappened to them.\r\n\r\n\"Who are the Russian officers in command of that air-ship?\" hailed\r\nMazanoff from the _Ariel_.\r\n\r\nTwo men in Russian uniform raised their hands in reply, and Mazanoff\r\nhailed again--\r\n\r\n\"Which will you have--surrender or death? If you surrender your lives\r\nare safe, and we will put you on to the land as soon as possible; if\r\nnot you will be shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"We surrender!\" exclaimed one of the officers, drawing his sword and\r\ndropping it on the deck. The other followed suit, and Mazanoff\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Remain where you are. The first man that moves will be\r\nshot down.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost before the last words had left his lips half a dozen men had\r\nslid down the wire ropes and landed on the deck of the _Lucifer_. The\r\nmoment their feet had touched the deck each whipped a magazine pistol\r\nout of his belt and covered his man.\r\n\r\nWithin a couple of minutes the captives were all disarmed; indeed,\r\nmost of them had thrown their weapons down on the first summons. The\r\narms were tossed overboard, and all but the two Russian officers were\r\nrapidly bound hand and foot. Then three of the six men descended to\r\nthe engine-room, and one went to the wheel-house. In another minute\r\nthe fan-wheels of the _Lucifer_ began to spin round faster, and\r\nquickly raised her to the level of the other three ships, and so the\r\nrecapture of the deserter was completed.\r\n\r\nThe two officers were at once summoned on board the _Ithuriel_ and\r\nshut up under guard in separate cabins. The rest of the crew of the\r\n_Lucifer_ was found to consist of the four traitors who had carried\r\nher away, and two Russian engineers who had been put on board to\r\nassist in the working of the vessel.\r\n\r\nAs soon as these had been replaced by a crew drafted from the\r\n_Ithuriel_ and her consorts under the command of Lieutenant Marston,\r\nArnold gave the order to go ahead at fifty miles an hour to the\r\nnorthward, and the four air-ships immediately sped away in that\r\ndirection, leaving Aberdeen to its fate, and within a little over an\r\nhour the sounds of both storm and battle had died away in silence\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nWhen they were fairly under way Natas ordered the four deserters to\r\nbe brought before him in the after saloon of the flagship. He sat at\r\none end of the table, and they were placed in a line in front of him\r\nat the other, each with a guard behind him, and the muzzle of a\r\npistol at his head.\r\n\r\n\"Peter Tamboff, Amos Vornjeh, Ivan Tscheszco, and Paul Oreloff! you\r\nhave broken your oaths, betrayed your companions, deserted the Cause\r\nto which you devoted your lives, and placed in the hands of the\r\nRussian tyrant the means of destruction which has enabled him to\r\nbreak the blockade of the Baltic, and so perhaps to change the whole\r\ncourse of the war which he is now waging, as you well know, with the\r\nobject of conquering Europe and enslaving its peoples.\r\n\r\n\"Already the lives of thousands of better men than you have been lost\r\nthrough this vile treason of yours, the vilest of all treason, for it\r\nwas committed for love of money. By the laws of the Brotherhood your\r\nlives are forfeit, and if you had a hundred lives each they would be\r\nforfeited again by the calamities that your treason has brought, and\r\nwill bring, upon the world. You will die in half an hour. If you have\r\nany preparations to make for the next world, make them. I have done\r\nwith you. Go!\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the four deserters were taken up on to the deck of\r\nthe _Ithuriel_. The signal was given to stop the flotilla, which was\r\nthen flying three thousand feet above the waters of the Moray Firth.\r\nAs soon as they came to a standstill their crews were summoned on\r\ndeck. The three smaller vessels floated around the _Ithuriel_ at a\r\ndistance of about fifty yards from her. The traitors, bound hand and\r\nfoot, were stood up facing the rail of the flagship, and four of her\r\ncrew were stationed opposite to them on the other side of the deck\r\nwith loaded rifles.\r\n\r\nThey were allowed one last look upon sun and sky, and then their eyes\r\nwere bandaged. As soon as this was done Arnold raised his hand; the\r\nfour rifles came up to the ready; a stream of flame shot from the\r\nmuzzles, and the bodies of the four traitors lurched forward over the\r\nrail and disappeared into the abyss beneath.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said Arnold in French, turning to the two Russian\r\nofficers who had been spectators of the scene, \"that is how we punish\r\ntraitors. Your own lives are spared because we do not murder\r\nprisoners of war. You will, I hope, in due time return to your\r\nmaster, and you will tell him why we have been obliged to retake the\r\nair-ship which he surrendered to us by force, and therefore why we\r\ndestroyed his flagship in the North Sea. If Admiral Prabylov had\r\nobeyed his orders, the _Lucifer_ would have been surrendered to us\r\nquietly, and there would have been for the present no further\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him also from me, as Admiral of the Terrorist fleet, that, so\r\nfar as matters have now gone, we shall take no further part in the\r\nwar; but that the moment he brings his war-balloons across the waters\r\nwhich separate Britain from Europe, the last hour of his empire will\r\nhave struck.\r\n\r\n\"If he neglects this warning with which I now entrust you, I will\r\nbring a force against him before which he shall be as helpless as the\r\narmies of the Alliance have so far been before him and his\r\nwar-balloons; and, more than this, tell him that if I conquer I will\r\nnot spare. I will hold him and his advisers strictly to account for\r\nall that may happen after that moment.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no treaties with conquered enemies in the hour of our\r\nvictory. We will have blood for blood, and life for life. Remember\r\nthat, and bear the message to him faithfully. For the present you\r\nwill be prisoners on parole; but I warn you that you will be watched\r\nnight and day, and at the first suspicion of treachery you will be\r\nshot, and cast into the air as those traitors were just now.\r\n\r\n\"You will remain on board this ship. The two engineers will be placed\r\none on board of each of two of our consorts. In twenty-four hours or\r\nso you will be landed on Spanish soil and left to your own devices.\r\nMeanwhile we shall make you as comfortable as the circumstances\r\npermit.\"\r\n\r\nThe two Russian officers bowed their acknowledgments, and Arnold gave\r\nthe signal for the flotilla to proceed.\r\n\r\nIt was then about seven o'clock in the evening. Flying at the rate of\r\na hundred miles an hour, the squadron crossed the mouth of the Moray\r\nFirth trending to the westward until they passed over Thurso, and\r\nthen took a westerly course to Rockall Island, four hundred miles to\r\nthe west. Here they met the two other air-ships which had been\r\ndespatched from Aeria with extra power-cylinders and munitions of war\r\nin case they had been needed for a prolonged campaign.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders, which had been exhausted on board the _Ithuriel_ and\r\nher three consorts, were replaced, and then the whole squadron rose\r\ninto the air from one of the peaks of Rockall Island and winged its\r\nway southward to the north-western coast of Spain. They made the\r\nSpanish land near Corunna shortly before eight on the following\r\nevening, and here the four Russian prisoners were released on the\r\nsea-shore and provided with money to take them as far as Valladolid,\r\nwhence they would be able to communicate with the French military\r\nauthorities at Toulouse.\r\n\r\nThe Terrorist Squadron then rose once more into the air, ascended to\r\na height of two thousand feet, skirted the Portuguese coast, and then\r\ntook a south-easterly course over Morocco through one of the passes\r\nof the Atlas Mountains, and so across the desert of Sahara and the\r\nwilds of Central Africa to Aeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BREAKING OF THE CHARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first news of the Russian attack on Aberdeen was received in\r\nLondon soon after five o'clock on the afternoon of the 30th, and\r\nproduced an effect which it is quite beyond the power of language to\r\ndescribe. The first telegram containing the bare announcement of the\r\nfact fell like a bolt from the blue on the great Metropolis. It ran\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n      Aberdeen, 4.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n    A large fleet, supposed to be the Russian fleet which broke the\r\n    blockade of the Baltic on the morning of the 28th, has appeared\r\n    off the town. About forty large vessels can be made out. Our\r\n    defences are quite inadequate to cope with such an immense force,\r\n    but we shall do our best till help comes.\r\n\r\nAfter that the wires were kept hot with messages until well into the\r\nnight. The newspapers rushed out edition after edition to keep pace\r\nwith them, and in all the office windows of the various journals\r\ncopies of the telegrams were posted up as soon as they arrived.\r\n\r\nAs the messages multiplied in number they brought worse and worse\r\ntidings, until excitement grew to frenzy and frenzy degenerated into\r\npanic. The thousand tongues of rumour wagged faster and faster as\r\neach hour went by. The raid upon a single town was magnified into a\r\ngeneral invasion of the whole country.\r\n\r\nVery few people slept in London that night, and the streets were\r\nalive with anxious crowds till daybreak, waiting for the\r\nconfidently-expected news of the landing of the Russian troops, in\r\nspite of the fact that the avowed and real object of the raid had\r\nbeen made public early in the evening. The following are the most\r\nimportant of the telegrams which were received, and will suffice to\r\ninform the reader of the course of events after the departure of the\r\nfour air-ships from the scene of action--\r\n\r\n      5 P.M.\r\n\r\n    A message has been received from the Commander of the Russian\r\n    fleet demanding the surrender of the town for twelve hours to\r\n    allow six of his ships to fill up with coal. The captain of the\r\n    _Ascalon_, in command of the port, has refused this demand, and\r\n    declares that he will fight while he has a ship that will float\r\n    or a gun that can be fired. The Russians are accompanied by the\r\n    air-ship which assisted them to break the blockade of the Sound.\r\n    She is now floating over the town. The utmost terror prevails\r\n    among the inhabitants, and crowds are flying into the country to\r\n    escape the bombardment. Aid has been telegraphed for to Edinburgh\r\n    and Dundee; but if the North Sea Squadron is still in the Firth\r\n    of Forth, it cannot get here under nearly twelve hours' steaming.\r\n\r\n      5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n    The bombardment has commenced, and fearful damage has been done\r\n    already. With three or four shells the air-ship has blown up and\r\n    utterly destroyed the fort on Girdleness, which mounted\r\n    twenty-four heavy guns. But for the ships, this leaves the town\r\n    almost unprotected. News has just come from the North Shore that\r\n    the batteries there have met with the same fate. The Russians are\r\n    pouring a perfect storm of shot and shell into the mouth of the\r\n    river where our ships are lying, but the town has so far been\r\n    spared.\r\n\r\n      5.45 P.M.\r\n\r\n    We have just received news from Edinburgh that the North Sea\r\n    Squadron left at daybreak this morning under orders to proceed to\r\n    the mouth of the Elbe to assist in protecting Hamburg from an\r\n    anticipated attack by the same fleet which has attacked us. There\r\n    is now no hope that the town can be successfully defended, and\r\n    the Provost has called a towns-meeting to consider the\r\n    advisability of surrender, though it is feared that the Russians\r\n    may now make larger demands. The whole country side is in a state\r\n    of the utmost panic.\r\n\r\n      7 P.M.\r\n\r\n    The towns-meeting empowered the Provost to call upon Captain\r\n    Marchmont, of the _Ascalon_, to make terms with the Russians in\r\n    order to save the town from destruction. He refused point blank,\r\n    although one of the coast-defence ships, the _Thunderer_, has\r\n    been disabled by shells from the air-ship, and all his other\r\n    vessels have been terribly knocked about by the incessant\r\n    cannonade from the fleet, which has now advanced to within two\r\n    miles of the shore, having nothing more to fear from the land\r\n    batteries. A terrific thunderstorm is raging, and no words can\r\n    describe the horror of the scene. The air-ship ceased firing\r\n    nearly an hour ago.\r\n\r\n      10 P.M.\r\n\r\n    Five of our eleven ships--two battleships and three\r\n    cruisers--have been sunk; the rest are little better than mere\r\n    wrecks, and seven torpedo-boats have been destroyed in attempting\r\n    to torpedo some of the enemy's ships. Heavy firing has been heard\r\n    to the southward, and we have learnt from Dundee that four\r\n    battleships and six cruisers have been sent to our relief. A\r\n    portion of the Russian fleet has been detached to meet them. We\r\n    cannot hope anything from them. Captain Marchmont has now only\r\n    four ships capable of fighting, but refuses to strike his flag.\r\n    The storm has ceased, and a strong land breeze has blown the\r\n    clouds and smoke to seaward. The air-ship has disappeared. Six\r\n    large Russian ironclads are heading at full speed towards the\r\n    mouth of the river--\r\n\r\nThe telegram broke off short here, and no more news was received from\r\nAberdeen for several hours. Of this there was only one possible\r\nexplanation. The town was in the hands of the Russians, and they had\r\ncut the wires. The long charm was broken, and the Isle Inviolate was\r\ninviolate no more. The next telegram from the North came from Findon,\r\nand was published in London just before ten o'clock on the following\r\nmorning. It ran thus--\r\n\r\n      Findon, N.B., 9.15.\r\n\r\n    About ten o'clock last night the attack on Aberdeen ended in a\r\n    rush of six ironclads into the river mouth. They charged down\r\n    upon the four half-crippled British ships that were left, and in\r\n    less than five minutes rammed and sank them. The Russians then\r\n    demanded the unconditional surrender of the town, under pain of\r\n    bombardment and destruction. There was no other course but to\r\n    yield, and until eight o'clock this morning the town has been in\r\n    the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n    The Russians at once landed a large force of sailors and marines,\r\n    cut the telegraph wires and the railway lines, and fired without\r\n    warning upon every one who attempted to leave the town. The\r\n    stores of coal and ammunition were seized, and six large cruisers\r\n    were taking in coal all night. The banks were also entered, and\r\n    the specie taken possession of, as indemnity for the town. At\r\n    eight o'clock the cruisers and battleships steamed out of the\r\n    river without doing further damage. The squadron from the Tay was\r\n    compelled to retire by the overwhelming force that the Russians\r\n    brought to bear upon it after Aberdeen surrendered.\r\n\r\n    Half an hour ago the Russian fleet was lost sight of proceeding\r\n    at full speed to the north-eastward. Our loss has been terribly\r\n    heavy. The fort and batteries have been destroyed, all the ships\r\n    have been sunk or disabled, and of the whole defending force\r\n    scarcely three hundred men remain. Captain Marchmont went down on\r\n    the _Ascalon_ with his flag flying, and fighting to the last\r\n    moment.\r\n\r\nWhile the excitement caused by the news of the raid upon Aberdeen was\r\nat its height, that is to say, on the morning of the 2nd of July,\r\nintelligence was received in London of a tremendous disaster to the\r\nAnglo-Teutonic Alliance. It was nothing less, in short, than the fall\r\nof Berlin, the collapse of the German Empire, and the surrender of\r\nthe Kaiser and the Crown Prince to the Tsar. After nearly sixty hours\r\nof almost continuous fighting, during which the fortifications had\r\nbeen wrecked by the war-balloons, the German ammunition-trains burnt\r\nand blown up by the fire-shells rained from the air, and the heroic\r\ndefenders of the city disorganised by the aërial bombardment of\r\nmelinite shells and cyanogen poison-bombs, and crushed by an\r\noverwhelming force of not less than four million assailants. So fell\r\nlike a house of cards the stately fabric built up by the genius of\r\nBismarck and Moltke; and so, after bearing his part gallantly in the\r\ndeath-struggle of his empire, had the grandson of the conqueror of\r\nSedan yielded up his sword to the victorious Autocrat of the Russias.\r\n\r\nThe terrible news fell upon London like the premonitory echo of an\r\napproaching storm. The path of the triumphant Muscovites was now\r\ncompletely open to the forts of the Belgian Quadrilateral, under the\r\nwalls of which they would form a junction, which nothing could now\r\nprevent, with the beleaguering forces of France. Would the Belgian\r\nstrongholds be able to resist any more effectually than the\r\nfortifications of Berlin had done the assaults of the terrible\r\nwar-balloons of the Tsar?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PATH OF CONQUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis narrative does not in any sense pretend to be a detailed history\r\nof the war, but only of such phases of it as more immediately concern\r\nthe working out of those deep-laid and marvellously-contrived plans\r\ndesigned by their author to culminate in nothing less than the\r\ncollapse of the existing fabric of Society, and the upheaval of the\r\nwhole basis of civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be impossible to follow the troops of the Alliance\r\nand the League through the different campaigns which were being\r\nsimultaneously carried out in different parts of Europe. The most\r\nthat can be done will be to present an outline of the leading events\r\nwhich, operating throughout a period of nearly three months, prepared\r\nthe way for the final catastrophe in which the tremendous issues of\r\nthe world-war were summed up.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Berlin was the first decisive blow that had been struck\r\nduring the war. Under it the federation of kingdoms and states which\r\nhad formed the German Empire fell asunder almost instantly, and the\r\nwhole fabric collapsed like a broken bubble. The shock was felt\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of Europe, and it was immediately\r\nseen that nothing but a miracle could save the whole of Central\r\nEurope from falling into the hands of the League.\r\n\r\nIts immediate results were the surrender of Magdeburg, Brunswick,\r\nHanover, and Bremen. Hamburg, strongly garrisoned by British and\r\nGerman troops, supported by a powerful squadron in the Elbe, and\r\ndefended by immense fortifications on the landward side, alone\r\nreturned a flat defiance to the summons of the Tsar. The road to the\r\nwestward, therefore, lay entirely open to his victorious troops. As\r\nfor Hamburg, it was left for the present under the observation of a\r\ncorps of reconnaissance to be dealt with when its time came.\r\n\r\nWhen Berlin fell the position of affairs in Europe may be briefly\r\ndescribed as follows:--The French army had taken the field nearly\r\nfive millions strong, and this immense force had been divided into an\r\nArmy of the North and an Army of the East. The former, consisting of\r\nabout two millions of men, had been devoted to the attack on the\r\nBritish and German forces holding an almost impregnable position\r\nbehind the chain of huge fortresses known at present as the Belgian\r\nQuadrilateral.\r\n\r\nThis Army of the North, doubtless acting in accordance with the\r\npreconceived schemes of operations arranged by the leaders of the\r\nLeague, had so far contented itself with a series of harassing\r\nattacks upon different points of the Allied position, and had made no\r\nforward movement in force. The Army of the East, numbering nearly\r\nthree million men, and divided into fifteen army corps, had crossed\r\nthe German frontier immediately on the outbreak of the war, and at\r\nthe same moment that the Russian Armies of the North and South had\r\ncrossed the eastern Austro-German frontier, and the Italian army had\r\nforced the passes of the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the French fleet of war-balloons had been attached to\r\nthe Army of the East with the intention, which had been realised\r\nbeyond the most sanguine expectations, of overrunning and subjugating\r\nCentral Europe in the shortest possible space of time. It had swept\r\nlike a destroying tempest through the Rhine Provinces, leaving\r\nnothing in its track but the ruins of towns and fortresses, and wide\r\nwastes of devastated fields and vineyards.\r\n\r\nBefore the walls of Munich it had effected a junction with the\r\nItalian army, consisting of ten army corps, numbering two million\r\nmen. The ancient capital of Bavaria fell in three days under the\r\nassault of the aërial fleet and the overwhelming numbers of the\r\nattacking force. Then the Franco-Italian armies advanced down the\r\nvalley of the Danube and invested Vienna, which, in spite of the\r\nheroic efforts of what had been left of the Austrian army after the\r\ndisastrous conflicts on the Eastern frontier, was stormed and sacked\r\nafter three days and nights of almost continuous fighting, and the\r\nmost appalling scenes of bloodshed and destruction, four days after\r\nthe surrender of the German Emperor to the Tsar had announced the\r\ncollapse of what had once been the Triple Alliance.\r\n\r\nFrom Vienna the Franco-Italian armies continued their way down the\r\nvalley of the Danube, and at Budapest was joined by the northern\r\ndivision of the Russian Army of the South, and from there the mighty\r\nflood of destruction rolled south-eastward until it overflowed the\r\nBalkan peninsula, sweeping everything before it as it went, until it\r\njoined the force investing Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish army, which had retreated before it, had concentrated\r\nupon Gallipoli, where, in conjunction with the allied British and\r\nTurkish Squadrons holding the Dardanelles, it prepared to advance to\r\nthe relief of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe final attack upon the Turkish capital had been purposely delayed\r\nuntil the arrival of the French war-balloons, and as soon as these\r\nappeared upon the scene the work of destruction instantly\r\nrecommenced. After four days of bombardment by sea and land, and from\r\nthe air, and a rapid series of what can only be described as\r\nwholesale butcheries, the ancient capital of the Sultan shared the\r\nfate of Berlin and Vienna, and after four centuries and a half the\r\nTurkish dominion in Europe died in its first stronghold.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one of the wings of the Franco-Italian army had made a\r\ndescent upon Gallipoli, and after forty-eight hours' incessant\r\nfighting had compelled the remnant of the Turkish army, which it thus\r\ncut off from Constantinople, to take refuge on the Turkish and\r\nBritish men-of-war under the protection of the guns of the fleet. In\r\nview of the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, and the terrible\r\neffectiveness of the war-balloons, it was decided that any attempt to\r\nretake Constantinople, or even to continue to hold the Dardanelles,\r\ncould only result in further disaster.\r\n\r\nThe forts of the Dardanelles were therefore evacuated and blown up,\r\nand the British and Turkish fleet, with the remains of the Turkish\r\narmy on board, steamed southward to Alexandria to join forces with\r\nthe British Squadron that was holding the northern approaches to the\r\nSuez Canal. There the Turkish troops were landed, and the Allied\r\nfleets prepared for the naval battle which the release of the Russian\r\nBlack Sea Squadron, through the opening of the Dardanelles, was\r\nconsidered to have rendered inevitable.\r\n\r\nFive days later was fought a second battle of the Nile, a battle\r\ncompared with which the former conflict, momentous as it had been,\r\nwould have seemed but child's play. On the one side Admiral\r\nBeresford, in command of the Mediterranean Squadron, had collected\r\nevery available ship and torpedo-boat to do battle for the defence of\r\nthe all-important Suez Canal, and opposed to him was an immense\r\narmament formed by the junction of the Russian Black Sea Squadron\r\nwith the Franco-Italian fleet, or rather those portions of it which\r\nhad survived the attacks, or eluded the vigilance of the British\r\nAdmiral.\r\n\r\nThe battle, fought almost on the ancient battle-ground of Nelson and\r\nCollingwood, was incomparably the greatest sea-fight in the history\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nThe fleet under Admiral Beresford's command consisted of fifty-five\r\nbattleships of the first and second class, forty-six armoured and\r\nseventy-two unarmoured cruisers, fifty-four gunboats, and two hundred\r\nand seventy torpedo-boats; while the Franco-Italian Allied fleets\r\nmustered between them forty-six battleships, seventy-five armoured\r\nand sixty-three unarmoured cruisers, forty gunboats, and two hundred\r\nand fifty torpedo-boats.\r\n\r\nThe battle began soon after sundown on the 24th of August, and raged\r\ncontinuously for over sixty hours. The whole issue of the fight was\r\nthe question of the command of the Mediterranean, and the British\r\nline of communication with India and the East _viâ_ the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nThe prize was well worthy of the tremendous struggle that the two\r\ncontending forces waged for it; and from the two Admirals in command\r\nto the boys employed on the most insignificant duties about the\r\nships, every one of the combatants seemed equally impressed with the\r\nmagnitude of the momentous issues at stake.\r\n\r\nTo the League, victory meant a deadly blow inflicted upon the only\r\nenemy now seriously to be reckoned with. It meant the severing of the\r\nBritish Empire into two portions, and the cutting of the one\r\nremaining channel of supply upon which the heart of the Empire now\r\ndepended for its nutrition. To destroy Admiral Beresford's fleet\r\nwould be to achieve as great a triumph on the sea as the armies of\r\nthe League had achieved on land by the taking of Berlin, Vienna, and\r\nConstantinople. On the other hand, the defeat of the Franco-Italian\r\nfleets meant complete command of the Mediterranean, and the ability\r\nto destroy in detail all the important sea-board fortresses and\r\narsenals of the League that were situated on its shores.\r\n\r\nIt meant the keeping open of the Suez Canal, the maintenance of\r\ncommunication with India and Australia by the shortest route, and,\r\nwhat was by no means the least important consideration, the\r\nvindication of British prestige in Egypt, the Soudan, and India. It\r\nwas with these enormous gains and losses before their eyes that the\r\ntwo forces engaged and fought as perhaps men had never fought with\r\neach other in the world before. Everything that science and\r\nexperience could suggest was done by the leaders of both sides. Human\r\nlife was counted as nothing in the balance, and deeds of the most\r\nreckless heroism were performed in countless instances as the mighty\r\nstruggle progressed.\r\n\r\nWith such inflexible determination was the battle waged on either\r\nside, and so appalling was the destruction accomplished by the\r\nweapons brought into play, that by sunrise on the morning of the\r\n27th, more than half the opposing fleets had been destroyed, and of\r\nthe remainder the majority were so crippled that a continuance of the\r\nfight had become a matter of physical impossibility.\r\n\r\nWhat advantage remained appeared to be on the side of the remains of\r\nthe Franco-Italian fleet; but this was speedily negatived an hour\r\nafter sunrise by the appearance of a fresh British Squadron,\r\nconsisting of the five battleships, fifteen cruisers, and a large\r\nflotilla of gunboats and torpedo-boats which had passed through the\r\nCanal during the night from Aden and Suakim, and appeared on the\r\nscene just in time to turn the tide of battle decisively in favour of\r\nthe British Admiral.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this new force got into action it went to work with\r\nterrible effectiveness, and in three hours there was not a single\r\nvessel that was still flying the French or Italian flag. The victory\r\nhad, it is true, been bought at a tremendous price, but it was\r\ncomplete and decisive, and at the moment that the last of the ships\r\nof the League struck her flag, Admiral Beresford stood in the same\r\nglorious position as Sir George Rodney had done a hundred and\r\ntwenty-two years before, when he saved the British Empire in the\r\never-memorable victory of the 12th of April 1782.\r\n\r\nThe triumph in the Mediterranean was, however, only a set-off to a\r\ndisaster which had occurred more than five weeks previously in the\r\nAtlantic. The Russian fleet, which had broken the blockade of the\r\nSound, with the assistance of the _Lucifer_, had, after coaling at\r\nAberdeen, made its way into the Atlantic, and there, in conjunction\r\nwith the Franco-Italian fleets operating along the Atlantic steamer\r\nroute, had, after a series of desperate engagements, succeeded in\r\nbreaking up the line of British communication with America and\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThis result had been achieved mainly in consequence of the contrast\r\nbetween the necessary methods of attack and defence. On the one hand,\r\nBritain had been compelled to maintain an extended line of ocean\r\ndefence more than three thousand miles in length, and her ships had\r\nfurther been hampered by the absolute necessity of attending, first,\r\nto the protection of the Atlantic liners, and, secondly, to warding\r\noff isolated attacks which were directed upon different parts of the\r\nline by squadrons which could not be attacked in turn without\r\nbreaking the line of convoy which it was all-essential to preserve\r\nintact.\r\n\r\nFor two or three weeks there had been a series of running fights; but\r\nat length the ocean chain had broken under the perpetual strain, and\r\na repulse inflicted on the Irish Squadron by a superior force of\r\nFrench, Italian, and Spanish warships had settled the question of the\r\ncommand of the Atlantic in favour of the League. The immediate result\r\nof this was that food supplies from the West practically stopped.\r\n\r\nNow and then a fleet Atlantic greyhound ran the blockade and brought\r\nher priceless cargo into a British port; but as the weeks went by\r\nthese occurrences became fewer and further between, till the time\r\nnews was received in London of the investment of the fortresses of\r\nthe Quadrilateral by the innumerable hosts of the League, brought\r\ntogether by the junction of the French and Russian Armies of the\r\nNorth and the conquerors of Vienna and Constantinople, who had\r\nreturned on their tracks after garrisoning their conquests in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nFood in Britain, already at war prices, now began to rise still\r\nfurther, and soon touched famine prices. Wheat, which in the last\r\ndecade of the nineteenth century had averaged about £9 a ton, rose to\r\nover £31 a ton, its price two years before the Battle of Waterloo.\r\nOther imported food-stuffs, of course, rose in proportion with the\r\nstaple commodity, and the people of Britain saw, at first dimly, then\r\nmore and more clearly, the real issue that had been involved in the\r\ndepopulation of the rural districts to swell the populations of the\r\ntowns, and the consequent lapse of enormous areas of land either into\r\npasturage or unused wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Britain began to see approaching her doors an enemy\r\nbefore whose assault all human strength is impotent and all valour\r\nunavailing. Like Imperial Rome, she had depended for her food supply\r\nupon external sources, and now these sources were one by one being\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the command of the Atlantic, the breaking of the Baltic\r\nblockade, and the consequent closing of all the continental ports\r\nsave Hamburg, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp, had left her\r\nentirely dependent upon her own miserably insufficient internal\r\nresources and the Mediterranean route to India and the East.\r\n\r\nMore than this, too, only Hamburg, Antwerp, and the fortresses of the\r\nQuadrilateral now stood between her and actual invasion,--that\r\nsupreme calamity which, until the raid upon Aberdeen, had been for\r\ncenturies believed to be impossible.\r\n\r\nOnce let the League triumph in the Netherlands, as it had done in\r\nCentral and South-Eastern Europe, and its legions would descend like\r\nan avalanche upon the shores of England, and the Lion of the Seas\r\nwould find himself driven to bay in the stronghold which he had held\r\ninviolate for nearly a thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nFROM CHAOS TO ARCADIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the three months of incessant strife and carnage which deluged\r\nthe plains and valleys of Europe with blood after the fall of Berlin,\r\nthe Terrorists took no part whatever in the war. At long intervals an\r\nair-ship was seen from the earth flying at full speed through the\r\nupper regions of the atmosphere, now over Europe, now over America,\r\nand now over Australia or the Cape of Good Hope; but if they held any\r\ncommunication with the earth they did so secretly, and only paid the\r\nbriefest of visits, the objects of which could only be guessed at.\r\n\r\nWhen one was sighted the fact was mentioned in the newspapers, and\r\nvague speculations were indulged in; but there was soon little room\r\nleft for these in the public attention, especially in Britain, for as\r\nthe news of disaster after disaster came pouring in, and the hosts of\r\nthe League drew nearer and nearer to the western shores of Europe,\r\nall eyes were turned more and more anxiously across \"the silver\r\nstreak\" which now alone separated the peaceful hills and valleys of\r\nEngland and Scotland from the destroying war-storm which had so\r\nswiftly desolated the fields of Europe, and all hearts were heavy\r\nwith apprehension of coming sorrows.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of their movements had naturally led to the supposition\r\nthat several of the air-ships had taken the air for some unknown\r\npurpose, but in reality there were only two of them afloat during\r\nnearly the whole of the three mouths.\r\n\r\nOf these, one was the _Orion_, on board of which Tremayne was\r\nvisiting the various centres of the Brotherhood throughout the\r\nEnglish-speaking world, making everything ready for the carrying out\r\nat the proper time of the great project to which he had devoted\r\nhimself since the memorable night at Alanmere, when he had seen the\r\nvision of the world's Armageddon. The other was under the command of\r\nMichael Roburoff, who was busy in America and Canada perfecting the\r\npreparations for checkmating the designs of the American Ring, which\r\nwere described in a former chapter.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the members of the Inner Circle and those of the\r\nOuter Circle, living in Aeria, were quietly pursuing the most\r\npeaceful avocations, building houses and water-mills, clearing fields\r\nand laying out gardens, fishing in the lake and streams, and hunting\r\nin the forests as though they had never heard of the horrors of war,\r\nand had no part or share in the Titanic strife whose final issue they\r\nwould soon have to go forth and decide.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest workers in the colony was the Admiral of the\r\naërial fleet. Morning after morning he shut himself up in his\r\nlaboratory for three or four hours experimenting with explosives of\r\nvarious kinds, and especially on a new form of fire-shell which he\r\nhad invented, and which he was now busy perfecting in preparation for\r\nthe next, and, as he hoped, final conflict that he would have to wage\r\nwith the forces of despotism and barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe afternoons he spent supervising the erection of the mills, and\r\nthe construction of new machinery, and in exploring the mountain\r\nsides in search of mineral wealth, of which he was delighted to find\r\nabundant promise that was afterwards realised beyond his\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nOn these exploring expeditions he was frequently accompanied by\r\nNatasha and Radna and her husband. Sometimes Arnold would be enticed\r\naway from his chemicals, and his designs on the lives of his enemies,\r\nand after breakfasting soon after sunrise would go off for a long\r\nday's ramble to some unknown part of their wonderful domain, in\r\nwhich, like children in a fairyland, they were always discovering\r\nsome new wonders and beauties. And, indeed, no children could have\r\nbeen happier or freer from care than they were during this delightful\r\ninterval in the tragedy in which they were so soon to play such\r\nconspicuous parts. The two wedded lovers, with the dark past put far\r\nbehind them for ever, found perfect happiness in each other's\r\nsociety, and so left, it is almost needless to add, Arnold and\r\nNatasha pretty much to their own devices. Indeed, Natasha had more\r\nthan once declared that she would have to get the Princess to join\r\nthe party, as Radna had proved herself a hopeless failure as a\r\nchaperone.\r\n\r\nEvery one in the valley by this time looked upon Arnold and Natasha\r\nas lovers, though their rank in the Brotherhood was so high that no\r\none ventured to speak of them as betrothed save by implication. How\r\nNatas regarded them was known only to himself. He, of course, saw\r\ntheir intimacy, and since he said nothing he doubtless looked upon it\r\nwith approval; but whether he regarded it as an intimacy of friends\r\nor of lovers, remained a mystery even to Natasha herself, for he\r\nnever by any chance made an allusion to it.\r\n\r\nAs for Arnold, he had scrupulously observed the compact tacitly made\r\nbetween them on the first and only occasion that he had ever spoken\r\nwords of love to her. They were the best of friends, the closest\r\ncompanions, and their intercourse with each other was absolutely\r\nfrank and unrestrained, just as it would have been between two close\r\nfriends of the same sex; but they understood each other perfectly,\r\nand by no word or deed did either cross the line that divides\r\nfriendship from love.\r\n\r\nShe trusted him absolutely in all things, and he took this trust as a\r\nsacred pledge between them that until his part of their compact had\r\nbeen performed, love was a forbidden subject, not even to be\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nSo perfectly did Natasha play her part that though he spent hours and\r\nhours alone with her on their exploring expeditions, and in rowing\r\nand sailing on the lake, and though he spent many another hour in\r\nsolitude, weighing her every word and action, he was utterly unable\r\nto truthfully congratulate himself on having made the slightest\r\nprogress towards gaining that love without which, even if he held her\r\nto the compact in the day of victory, victory itself would be robbed\r\nof its crowning glory and dearest prize.\r\n\r\nTo a weaker man it would have been an impossible situation, this\r\nconstant and familiar companionship with a girl whose wonderful\r\nbeauty dazzled his eyes and fired his blood as he looked upon it, and\r\nwhose winning charm of manner and grace of speech and action seemed\r\nto glorify her beauty until she seemed a being almost beyond the\r\nreach of merely human love--rather one of those daughters of men whom\r\nthe sons of God looked upon in the early days of the world, and found\r\nso fair that they forsook heaven itself to woo them.\r\n\r\nTrained and disciplined as he had been in the sternest of all\r\nschools, and strengthened as he was by the knowledge of the compact\r\nthat existed between them, there were moments when his self-control\r\nwas very sorely tried, moments when her hand would be clasped in his,\r\nor rested on his shoulder as he helped her across a stream or down\r\nsome steep hillside, or when in the midst of some animated discussion\r\nshe would stop short and face him, and suddenly confound his logic\r\nwith a flash from her eyes and a smile on her lips that literally\r\nforced him to put forth a muscular effort to prevent himself from\r\ncatching her in his arms and risking everything for just one kiss,\r\none taste of the forbidden fruit within his reach, and yet parted\r\nfrom him by a sea of blood and flame that still lay between the world\r\nand that empire of peace which he had promised to win for her sweet\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nOnce, and once only, she had tried him almost too far. They had been\r\ndiscussing the possibility of ruling the world without the ultimate\r\nappeal to force, when the nations, weary at length of war, should\r\nhave consented to disarm, and she, carried away by her own eloquent\r\npleading for the ultimate triumph of peace and goodwill on earth, had\r\nlaid her hand upon his arm, and was looking up at him with her lovely\r\nface aglow with the sweetest expression even he had ever seen upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and there was a sudden silence between them. The\r\neloquent words died upon her lips, and a deep flush rose to her\r\ncheeks and then faded instantly away, leaving her pale and with a\r\nlook almost of terror in her eyes. He took a quick step backwards,\r\nand, turning away as though he feared to look any longer upon her\r\nbeauty, said in a low tone that trembled with the strength of his\r\nrepressed passion--\r\n\r\n\"Natasha, for God's sake remember that I am only made of flesh and\r\nblood!\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment she was by his side again, this time with her eyes\r\ndowncast and her proud little head bent as though in acknowledgment\r\nof his reproof. Then she looked up again, and held out her hand and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me; I have done wrong! Let us be friends again!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a gentle emphasis on the word \"friends\" that was\r\nirresistible. He took her hand in silence, and after a pressure that\r\nwas almost imperceptibly returned, let it go again, and they walked\r\non together; but there was very little more said between them that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThis had happened one afternoon towards the middle of September, and\r\ntwo days later their delightful companionship came suddenly to an\r\nend, and the bond that existed between them was severed in a moment\r\nwithout warning, as a nerve thrilling with pleasure might be cut by\r\nan unexpected blow with a knife.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of September the _Orion_ returned from Australia. She\r\ntouched the earth shortly after mid-day, and before sunset the\r\n_Azrael_, the vessel in which Michael Roburoff had gone to America,\r\nalso returned, but without her commander. Her lieutenant, however,\r\nbrought a despatch from him, which he delivered at once to Natas,\r\nwho, immediately on reading it, sent for Tremayne.\r\n\r\nIt evidently contained matters of great importance, for they remained\r\nalone together discussing it for over an hour. At the end of that\r\ntime Tremayne left the Master's house and went to look for Arnold. He\r\nfound him just helping Natasha out of a skiff at a little\r\nlanding-stage that had been built out into the lake for boating\r\npurposes. As soon as greetings had been exchanged, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Natasha, I have just left your father. He asked me, if I saw you, to\r\ntell you that he wishes to speak to you at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Natasha. \"I hope you have not brought bad news home\r\nfrom your travels. You are looking very serious about something,\" and\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, she was gone to obey her father's\r\nsummons. As soon as she was out of earshot Tremayne put his arm\r\nthrough Arnold's, and, drawing him away towards a secluded portion of\r\nthe shore of the lake, said--\r\n\r\n\"Arnold, old man, I have some very serious news for you. You must\r\nprepare yourself for the severest strain that, I believe, could be\r\nput on your loyalty and your honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? For Heaven's sake don't tell me that it has to do with\r\nNatasha!\" exclaimed Arnold, stopping short and facing round, white to\r\nthe lips with the sudden fear that possessed him. \"You know\"--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know everything,\" replied Tremayne, speaking almost as gently\r\nas a woman would have done, \"and I am sorry to say that it has to do\r\nwith her. I know what your hopes have been with regard to her, and no\r\nman on earth could have wished to see those hopes fulfilled more\r\nearnestly than I have done, but\"--\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Tremayne? Speak out, and let me know the worst. If\r\nyou tell me that I am to give her up, I tell you that I am\"--\r\n\r\n\"'That I am an English gentleman, and that I will break my heart\r\nrather than my oath'--that is what you will tell me when I tell you\r\nthat you must not only give up your hopes of winning Natasha, but\r\nthat it is the Master's orders that you shall have the _Ithuriel_\r\nready to sail at midnight to take her to America to Michael Roburoff,\r\nwho has written to Natas to ask her for his wife.\"\r\n\r\nArnold heard him out in dazed, stupefied silence. It seemed too\r\nmonstrous, too horrible, to be true. The sudden blow had stunned him.\r\nHe tried to speak, but the words would not come. Tremayne, still\r\nstanding with his arm through his, felt his whole body trembling, as\r\nthough stricken with some sudden palsy. He led him on again, saying\r\nin a sterner tone than before--\r\n\r\n\"Come, come! Play the man, and remember that the work nearest to your\r\nhand is war, and not love. Remember the tremendous issues that are\r\ngathering to their fulfilment, and the part that you have to play in\r\nworking them out. This is not a question of the happiness or the\r\nhopes of one man or woman, but of millions, of the whole human race.\r\nYou, and you alone, hold in your hands the power to make the defeat\r\nof the League certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I will use it, have no fear of that!\" replied Arnold, stopping\r\nagain and passing his hand over his eyes like a man waking from an\r\nevil dream. \"What I have sworn to do I will do; I am not going back\r\nfrom my oath. I will obey to the end, for she will do the same, and\r\nwhat would she think of me if I failed! Leave me alone for a bit now,\r\nold man. I must fight this thing out with myself, but the _Ithuriel_\r\nshall be ready to start at twelve.\"\r\n\r\nTremayne saw that he was himself again, and that it was better that\r\nhe should do as he said; so with a word of farewell he turned away\r\nand left him alone with his thoughts. Half-way back to the settlement\r\nhe met Natasha coming down towards the lake. She was deadly pale, but\r\nshe walked with a firm step, and carried her head as proudly erect as\r\never. As they met she stopped him and said--\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\nTremayne's first thought was to try and persuade her to go back and\r\nleave Arnold to himself, but a look at Natasha's white set face and\r\nburning eyes warned him that she was not in a mood to take advice,\r\nand so he told her, and without another word she went on swiftly down\r\nthe path that led to the lake.\r\n\r\nThe brief twilight of the tropics had passed before he reached a\r\ngrove of palms on the western shore of the lake, towards which he had\r\nbent his steps when he left Tremayne. He walked with loose, aimless\r\nstrides, now quickly and now slowly, and now stopping to watch the\r\nbrightening moon shining upon the water.\r\n\r\nHe caught himself thinking what a lovely night it would be to take\r\nNatasha for a row, and then his mind sprang back with a jerk to the\r\nremembrance of the horrible journey that he was to begin at\r\nmidnight--to take Natasha to another man, and leave her with him as\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nNo, it could not be true. It was impossible that he should have\r\nfought and triumphed as he had done, and all for this. To give up the\r\none woman he had ever loved in all his life, the woman he had\r\nsnatched from slavery and degradation when not another man on earth\r\ncould have done it.\r\n\r\nWhat had this Roburoff done that she should be given to him for the\r\nmere asking? Why had he not come in person like a man to woo and win\r\nher if he could, and then he would have stood aside and bowed to her\r\nchoice. But this curt order to take her away to him as though she\r\nwere some piece of merchandise--no, if such things were possible,\r\nbetter that he had never--\r\n\r\n\"Richard!\"\r\n\r\nHe felt a light touch on his arm, and turned round sharply. Natasha\r\nwas standing beside him. He had been so engrossed by his dark\r\nthoughts that he had not heard her light step on the soft sward, and\r\nnow he seemed to see her white face and great shining eyes looking up\r\nat him in the moonlight as though there was some mist floating\r\nbetween him and her. Suddenly the mist seemed to vanish. He saw tears\r\nunder the long dark lashes, and the sweet red lips parted in a faint\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nLose her he might to-morrow, but for this one moment she was his and\r\nno other man's, let those who would say nay. That instant she was\r\nclasped helpless and unresisting in his arms, and her lips were\r\ngiving his back kiss for kiss. Wreck and chaos might come now for all\r\nhe cared. She loved him, and had given herself to him, if only for\r\nthat one moonlit hour.\r\n\r\nAfter that he could plunge into the battle again, and slay and spare\r\nnot--yes, and he would slay without mercy. He would hurl his\r\nlightnings from the skies, and where they struck there should be\r\ndeath. If not love and life, then hate and death--it was not his\r\nchoice. Let those who had chosen see to that; but for the present\r\nlove and life were his, why should he not live? Then the mad, sweet\r\ndelirium passed, and saner thoughts came. He released her suddenly,\r\nalmost brusquely, and said with a harsh ring in his voice--\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come? Have you forgotten what so nearly happened the day\r\nbefore yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not forgotten it. I have remembered it, and that is why I\r\ncame to tell you--what you know now.\"\r\n\r\nHer face was rosy enough now, and she looked him straight in the eyes\r\nas she spoke, proud to confess the mastery that he had won.\r\n\r\n\"Now listen,\" she went on, speaking in a low, quick, passionate tone.\r\n\"The will of the Master must be done. There is no appeal from that,\r\neither for you or me. He can dispose of me as he chooses, and I shall\r\nobey, as I warned you I should when you first told me that you would\r\nwin me if you could.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you have won me, so far as I can be won. I love you, and I\r\nhave come to tell you so before the shadow falls between us. And I\r\nhave come to tell you that what you have won shall belong to no one\r\nelse. I will obey my father to the letter, but the spirit is my\r\naffair. Now kiss me again, dear, and say good-bye. We have had our\r\nglimpse of heaven, and this is not the only life.\"\r\n\r\nFor one more brief moment she surrendered herself to him again. Their\r\nlips met and parted, and in an instant she had slipped out of his\r\narms and was gone, leaving him dazed with her beauty and her\r\nwinsomeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nLOVE AND DUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later he walked back to the settlement, looking five years\r\nolder than he had done a couple of hours before, but with his nerves\r\nsteady and with the light of a solemn resolve burning in his eyes. He\r\nwent straight to the _Ithuriel_, and made a minute personal\r\ninspection of the whole vessel, inside and out. He saw that every\r\ncylinder was charged, and that there was an ample supply of spare\r\nones and ammunition on board, including a number of his new\r\nfire-shells. Then he went to Lieutenant Marston's quarters, and told\r\nhim to have the crew in their places by half-past eleven; and this\r\ndone, he paid a formal visit to the Master to report all ready.\r\n\r\nNatas received him as usual, just as though nothing out of the common\r\nhad happened; and if he noticed the change that had come over him, he\r\nmade no sign that he did so. When Arnold had made his report, he\r\nmerely said--\r\n\r\n\"Very good. You will start at twelve. The Chief has told you the\r\nnature and purpose of the voyage you are about to make, I presume?\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed a silent affirmative, and Natas went on--\r\n\r\n\"The Chief and Anna Ornovski will go with you as witnesses for\r\nMichael Roburoff and Natasha, and the Chief will be provided with my\r\nsealed orders for your guidance in the immediate future. The\r\nrendezvous is a house on one of the spurs of the Alleghany Mountains.\r\nWhat time will it take to reach there?\"\r\n\r\n\"The distance is about seven thousand miles. That will be from thirty\r\nto thirty-five hours' flight according to the wind. With a fair wind\r\nwe shall reach the Alleghanies a little before sunrise on the 18th.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then to make sure of that, if possible, you had better start an hour\r\nearlier. Natasha is making her preparations, and will be on board at\r\neleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; I will be ready to start then,\" replied Arnold, speaking\r\nas calmly and formally as Natas had done. Then he saluted and walked\r\nout.\r\n\r\nWhen he got into the open air he drew a deep breath. His teeth came\r\ntogether with a sharp snap, and his hands clenched. So it was true,\r\nthen, this horrible thing, this sacrilege, this ruin, that had fallen\r\nupon his life and hers. Natas had spoken of giving her to this man as\r\nquietly as though it had been the most natural proceeding possible,\r\nan understood arrangement about which there could be no question.\r\nWell, he had sworn, and he would obey, but there would be a heavy\r\nprice to pay for his obedience.\r\n\r\nHe did not see Natasha again that night. When the _Ithuriel_ rose\r\ninto the air she was in her cabin with the Princess, and did not\r\nappear during the voyage save at meals, when all the others were\r\npresent, and then she joined in the conversation with a composure\r\nwhich showed that, externally at least, she had quite regained her\r\nhabitual self-control.\r\n\r\nArnold spent the greater part of the voyage in the deck-saloon with\r\nTremayne, talking over the events of the war, and arranging plans of\r\nfuture action. By mutual consent the object of their present voyage\r\nwas not mentioned. As Arnold was more than two months and a half\r\nbehind the news, he found not a little relief in hearing from\r\nTremayne of all that had taken place since the recapture of the\r\n_Lucifer_.\r\n\r\nThe two men, who were now to be the active leaders of the Revolution\r\nwhich, as they hoped, was soon to overturn the whole fabric of\r\nSociety, and introduce a new social order of things, conversed in\r\nthis fashion, quietly discussing the terrific tragedy in which they\r\nwere to play the leading parts, and arranging all the details of\r\ntheir joint action, until well into the night of the 17th.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven Tremayne went to his cabin, and Arnold, going to the\r\nconning-tower, told the man on the look-out to go below until he was\r\ncalled. Then he took his place, and remained alone with his thoughts\r\nas the _Ithuriel_ sped on her way a thousand feet above the deserted\r\nwaters of the Atlantic, until the dark mass of the American Continent\r\nloomed up in front of him to the westward.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he sighted land he went aft to the wheel-house, and\r\nslightly inclined the air-planes, causing the _Ithuriel_ to soar\r\nupwards until the barometer marked a height of 6000 feet. At this\r\nelevation he passed over the mouth of the Chesapeake, and across\r\nVirginia; and a little more than an hour before sunrise the\r\n_Ithuriel_ sank to the earth on one of the spurs of the Alleghanies,\r\nin sight of a lonely weather-board house, in one of the windows of\r\nwhich three lights were burning in the form of a triangle.\r\n\r\nThis building was used ostensibly as a shooting and hunting-box by\r\nMichael Roburoff and a couple of his friends, and in reality as a\r\nmeeting-place for the Inner Circle or Executive Council of the\r\nAmerican Section of the Brotherhood. This Section was, numerically\r\nspeaking, the most important of the four branches into which the\r\nOuter Circle of the Brotherhood was divided--that is to say, the\r\nBritish, Continental, American, and Colonial Sections.\r\n\r\nAll told, the Terrorists had rather more than five million adherents\r\nin America and Canada, of whom more than four millions were men in\r\nthe prime of life, and nearly all of Anglo-Saxon blood and English\r\nspeech. All these men were not only armed, but trained in the use of\r\nfirearms to a high degree of skill; their organisation, which had\r\ngradually grown up with the Brotherhood for twenty years, was known\r\nto the world only under the guise of the different forms of\r\nindustrial unionism, but behind these there was a perfect system of\r\ndiscipline and command which the outer world had never even\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nThe Section was divided first into squads of ten under the command of\r\nan eleventh, who alone knew the leaders of the other squads in his\r\nneighbourhood. Ten of these squads made a company, commanded by one\r\nman, who was only known to the squad-captains, and who alone knew the\r\ncaptain of the regiment, which was composed of ten companies.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the organisation was the brigade, consisting of ten\r\nregiments, the captains of which alone knew the commander of the\r\nbrigade, while the commanders of the brigades were alone acquainted\r\nwith the members of the Inner Circle or Executive Council which\r\nmanaged the affairs of the whole Section, and whose Chief was the\r\nonly man in the Section who could hold any communication with the\r\nInner Circle of the Brotherhood itself, which, under the immediate\r\ncommand of Natas, governed the whole organisation throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThis description will serve for all the Sections, as all were\r\nmodelled upon exactly the same plan. The advantages of such an\r\norganisation will at once be obvious. In the first place, no member\r\nof the rank and file could possibly betray more than ten of his\r\nfellows, including his captain; while his treachery could, if\r\nnecessary, be made known in a few hours to ten thousand others, not\r\none of whom he knew, and thus it would be impossible for him to\r\nescape the invariable death penalty. The same is, of course, equally\r\ntrue of the captains and the commanders.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the system was equally convenient for the\r\ntransmission of orders from headquarters. An order given to ten\r\ncommanders of brigades could, in a single night, be transmitted\r\nindividually to the whole of the Section, and yet those in command of\r\nthe various divisions would not know whence the orders came, save as\r\nregards their immediate superiors.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary for the reader to bear these few particulars in\r\nmind in order to understand future developments, which, without them,\r\nmight seem to border on the impossible. It is only necessary to add\r\nthat the full fighting strength of the four Sections of the\r\nBrotherhood amounted to about twelve millions of men, a considerable\r\nproportion of whom were serving as soldiers in the armies of the\r\nLeague and the Alliance, and that in its cosmopolitan aspect it was\r\nknown to the rank and file as the Red International, whose members\r\nknew each other only by the possession of a little knot of red ribbon\r\ntied into the button-hole in a peculiar fashion on occasions of\r\nmeetings for instruction or drill.\r\n\r\nThe three lights burning in the form of a triangle in the window of\r\nthe house were a prearranged signal to avoid mistake on the part of\r\nthose on board the air-ship. When they reached the earth, Arnold,\r\nacting under the instructions of Tremayne, who was his superior on\r\nland though his voluntary subordinate when afloat, left the\r\n_Ithuriel_ and her crew in charge of Lieutenant Marston and Andrew\r\nSmith, the coxswain.\r\n\r\nThe remainder disembarked, and then the air-ship rose from the ground\r\nand ascended out of sight through a layer of clouds that hung some\r\neight hundred feet above the high ground of the hills. Lieutenant\r\nMarston's orders were to remain out of sight for an hour and then\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nArnold had not seen Natasha for several hours previous to the\r\nlanding, and he noticed with wonder, by no means unmixed with\r\nsomething very like anger, that she looked a great deal more cheerful\r\nthan she had done during the voyage. She had preserved her composure\r\nall through, but the effort of restraint had been visible. Now this\r\nhad vanished, although the supreme hour of the sacrifice that her\r\nfather had commanded her to make was actually at hand. When her feet\r\ntouched the earth she looked round with a smile on her lips and a\r\nflush on her cheeks, and said, in a voice in which there was no\r\nperceptible trace of anxiety or suffering--\r\n\r\n\"So this is the place of my bridal, is it? Well, I must say that a\r\nmore cheerful one might have been selected; yet perhaps, after all,\r\nsuch a gloomy spot is more suitable to the ceremony. Come along; I\r\nsuppose the bridegroom will be anxiously waiting the coming of the\r\nbride. I wonder what sort of a reception I shall have. Come, my Lord\r\nof Alanmere, your arm; and you, Captain Arnold, bring the Princess.\r\nWe have a good deal to do before it gets light.\"\r\n\r\nThese were strange words to be uttered by a girl who but a few hours\r\nbefore had voluntarily confessed her love for one man, and was on the\r\neve of compulsorily giving herself up to another one. Had it been any\r\none else but Natasha, Arnold could have felt only disgust; but his\r\nlove made it impossible for him to believe her guilty of such\r\nunworthy lightness as her words bespoke, even on the plain evidence\r\nbefore him, so he simply choked back his anger as best he might, and\r\nfollowed towards the house, speechless with astonishment at the\r\nmarvellous change that had come over the daughter of Natas.\r\n\r\nTremayne knocked in a peculiar fashion on the window, and then\r\nrepeated the knock on the door, which was opened almost immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Who stands there?\" asked a voice in French.\r\n\r\n\"Those who bring the expected bride,\" replied Tremayne in German.\r\n\r\n\"And by whose authority?\" This time the question was in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"In the Master's name,\" said Tremayne in English.\r\n\r\n\"Enter! you are welcome.\"\r\n\r\nA second door was now opened inside the house, and through it a light\r\nshone into the passage. The four visitors entered, and, passing\r\nthrough the second door, found themselves in a plainly-furnished\r\nroom, down the centre of which ran a long table, flanked by five\r\nchairs on each side, in each of which, save one, sat a masked and\r\nshrouded figure exactly similar to those which Arnold had seen when\r\nhe was first introduced to the Council-chamber in the house on\r\nClapham Common. In a chair at one end of the table sat another figure\r\nsimilarly draped.\r\n\r\nThe door was closed as they entered, and the member of the Circle who\r\nhad let them in returned to his seat. No word was spoken until this\r\nwas done. Then Natasha, leaving her three companions by the door,\r\nadvanced alone to the lower end of the table.\r\n\r\nAs she did so, Arnold for the first time noticed that she carried her\r\nmagazine pistol in a sheath at her belt. He and Tremayne were, as a\r\nmatter of course, armed with a brace of these weapons, but this was\r\nthe first time that he had ever seen Natasha carry her pistol openly.\r\nWondering greatly what this strange sight might mean, he waited with\r\nbreathless anxiety for the drama to begin.\r\n\r\nAs Natasha took her stand at the opposite end of the table, the\r\nfigure in the chair at the top rose and unmasked, displaying the\r\npallid countenance of the Chief of the American Section. He looked to\r\nArnold anything but a bridegroom awaiting his bride, and the ceremony\r\nwhich was to unite him to her for ever. His cheeks and lips were\r\nbloodless, and his eyes wandered restlessly from Natasha to Tremayne\r\nand back again. He glanced to and fro in silence for several moments,\r\nand when he at last found his voice he said, in half-choked, broken\r\naccents--\r\n\r\n\"What is this? Why am I honoured by the presence of the Chief and the\r\nAdmiral of the Air? I asked only that if the Master consented to\r\ngrant my humble petition in reward for my services, the daughter of\r\nNatas should come attended simply by a sister of the Brotherhood and\r\nthe messenger that I sent.\"\r\n\r\nThey let him finish, although it was with manifest difficulty that he\r\nstammered to the end of his speech. Arnold, still wondering at the\r\nstrange turn events had taken, saw Tremayne's lips tighten and his\r\nbrows contract in the effort to repress a smile. The other masked\r\nfigures at the table moved restlessly in their seats, and glanced\r\nfrom one to another. Seeing this, Tremayne stepped quickly forward to\r\nNatasha's side, and said in a stern, commanding tone--\r\n\r\n\"I am the Chief of the Central Council, and I order every one here to\r\nkeep his seat and remain silent until the daughter of Natas has\r\nspoken.\"\r\n\r\nThe ten masked and hooded heads instantly bowed consent. Then\r\nTremayne stepped back again, and Natasha spoke. There was a keen,\r\nangry light in her eyes, and a bright flush upon her cheek, but her\r\nvoice was smooth and silvery, and in strange contrast to the words\r\nthat she used, almost to the end.\r\n\r\n\"Did you think, Michael Roburoff, that the Master of the Terror would\r\nsend his daughter to her bridal so poorly escorted as you say? Surely\r\nthat would have been almost as much of a slight as you put upon me\r\nwhen, instead of coming to woo me as a true lover should have done,\r\nyou contented yourself with sending a messenger as though you were\r\nsome Eastern potentate despatching an envoy to demand the hand of the\r\ndaughter of a vassal.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem that this sudden love which you do me the honour to\r\nprofess for me has destroyed your manners as well as your reason. But\r\nsince you have assumed so high a dignity, it is not seemly that you\r\nshould stand to hear what I have to say; sit down, for it looks as\r\nthough standing were a trouble to you.\"\r\n\r\nMichael Roburoff, who by this time could scarcely support himself on\r\nhis trembling limbs, sank suddenly back into his chair and covered\r\nhis face with his hands.\r\n\r\n\"That is not very lover-like to cover your eyes when the bride that\r\nyou have asked for is standing in front of you; but as long as you\r\ndon't cover your ears as well, I will forgive you the slight. Now,\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n\"I have come, as you see, and I have brought with me the answer of\r\nthe Master to your request. Until an hour ago I did not know what it\r\nwas myself, for, like the rest of the faithful members of the\r\nBrotherhood, I obey the word of the Master blindly.\r\n\r\n\"You, as it would appear, maddened by what you are pleased to call\r\nyour love for me, have dared to attempt to make terms where you swore\r\nto obey blindly to the death. You have dared to place me, the\r\ndaughter of Natas, in the balance against the allegiance of the\r\nAmerican Section on the eve of the supreme crisis of its work, thus\r\nimperilling the results of twenty years of labour.\r\n\r\n\"If you had not been mad you would have foreseen the results of such\r\ntreachery. As it is you must learn them now. What I have said has\r\nbeen proved by your own hand, and the proof is here in the hand of\r\nthe Chief. This is the answer of Natas to the servant who would have\r\nbetrayed him in the hour of trial.\"\r\n\r\nShe took a folded paper from her belt as she spoke, and, unfolding\r\nit, read in clear, deliberate tones--\r\n\r\n    Michael Roburoff, late chief of the American Section of the\r\n    Brotherhood. When you joined the Order, you took an oath to obey\r\n    the directions of its chiefs to the death, and you acknowledged\r\n    that death would be the just penalty of perjury. My orders to you\r\n    were to complete the arrangements for bringing the American\r\n    Section into action when you received the signal to do so.\r\n    Instead of doing that, you have sought to bargain with me for the\r\n    price of its allegiance. That is treachery, and the penalty of\r\n    treachery is death.\r\n\r\n      NATAS.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the words of the Master,\" continued Natasha, throwing the\r\npaper down upon the table with one hand, and drawing her pistol with\r\nthe other. \"It rests with the Chief to say when and where the\r\nsentence of the Master shall be carried out.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"He dropped back into his chair with a bullet in his\r\nbrain.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 275._]\r\n\r\n\"Let it be carried out here, and now,\" said Tremayne, \"and let him\r\nwho has anything to say against it speak now, or for ever hold his\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nThe ten heads bowed once more in silence, and Natasha went on still\r\naddressing the trembling wretch who sat huddled in the chair in front\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n\"You have asked for a bride, Michael Roburoff, and she has come to\r\nyou, and I can promise you that you shall sleep soundly in her\r\nembrace. Your bride is Death, and I have chosen to bring her to you\r\nwith my own hand, that all here may see how the daughter of Natas can\r\navenge an insult to her womanhood.\r\n\r\n\"You have been guilty of treachery to the Brotherhood, and for that\r\nyou might have been punished by any hand; but you would also have\r\ncondemned me to the infamy of a loveless marriage, and that is an\r\ninsult that no one shall punish but myself. Look up, and, if you can,\r\ndie like a man.\"\r\n\r\nRoburoff took his hands from his face, and with an inarticulate cry\r\nstarted to his feet. The same instant Natasha's hand went up, her\r\npistol flashed, and he dropped back again into his chair with a\r\nbullet in his brain. Then she replaced the pistol in her belt, and\r\ngoing up to Arnold held out both her hands and said, as he clasped\r\nthem in his own--\r\n\r\n\"If the Master's reply had been different, that bullet would by this\r\ntime have been in my own heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE OF A CONTINENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after the execution of Michael Roburoff the _Ithuriel_\r\nwas winging her way back to Aeria, and at least two of her company\r\nwere anticipating their return to the valley with feelings very\r\ndifferent to those with which they had contemplated their departure.\r\n\r\nWhen the last farewells and congratulations had been spoken, and the\r\nair-ship rose from the earth, Tremayne returned to the house to\r\ncommence forthwith the great task which now developed upon him; for\r\nin addition to being Chief of the Central Executive, he now assumed\r\nthe direct command of the American Section, which, after long\r\nconsideration, had been selected as the nucleus of the Federation of\r\nthe English-speaking peoples of the world.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight he worked almost night and day, attending to every\r\ndetail with the utmost care, and bringing into play all those rare\r\npowers of mind which in the first instance had led Natas to select\r\nhim as the visible head of the Executive. In this way the chief\r\nconsequence of the love-madness of Roburoff had been to place at the\r\nhead of affairs in America the one man of all others most fitted by\r\ndescent and ability to carry out such a work, and to this fact its\r\ncomplete success must in a great measure be attributed.\r\n\r\nSo perfectly were his plans laid and executed, that right up to the\r\nmoment when the signal was given and the plans became actions,\r\nAmerican society went about its daily business without the remotest\r\nsuspicion that it was living on the slope of a slumbering volcano\r\nwhose fires were so soon to burst forth and finally consume the\r\nsocial fabric which, despite its splendid exterior, was inwardly as\r\nrotten as were the social fabrics of Rome and Byzantium on the eve of\r\ntheir fall.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of October the cables brought the news of the fall of the\r\nQuadrilateral, the storming of Hamburg, and the retreat of the\r\nBritish forces on Antwerp. Four days later came the tidings of a\r\ngreat battle under the walls of Antwerp, in which the British and\r\nGerman forces, outnumbered ten to one by the innumerable hosts of the\r\nLeague, had suffered a decisive defeat, which rendered it imperative\r\nfor them to fall back upon the Allied fleets in the Scheldt, and to\r\nleave the Netherlands to the mercy of the Tsar and his allies, who\r\nwere thus left undisputed masters of the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis last and crowning victory had been achieved by exactly the same\r\nmeans which had accomplished all the other triumphs of the campaign,\r\nand therefore there will be no need to enter into any detailed\r\ndescription of it. Indeed, the fall of the Quadrilateral and the\r\ndefeat of the last army of the Alliance round Antwerp would have been\r\naccomplished much more easily and speedily than it had been but for\r\nthe fact that the weather, which had been fine up to the end of July,\r\nhad suddenly broken, and a succession of violent storms and gales\r\nfrom the north and north-west had made it impossible for the\r\nwar-balloons to be brought into action with any degree of\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of September the storms had ceased, and then the\r\nwork of destruction began. Not even the hitherto impregnable\r\nfortresses of Tournay, Mons, Namur, and Liége had been able to\r\nwithstand the assault from the air any better than the forts of\r\nBerlin or the walls of Constantinople. A day's bombardment had\r\nsufficed to reduce them to ruins, and, the chain once broken, the\r\narmies of the League swept in wave after wave across the plains which\r\nthey had guarded.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life had been unparalleled even in this the greatest of\r\nall wars, for the British and Germans had fought with a dogged\r\nresolution which, but for the vastly superior numbers and the\r\nirresistible means of destruction employed against them, must\r\ninfallibly have triumphed. As it was, it was only when valour had\r\nachieved its last sacrifice, and further resistance became rather\r\nmadness than devotion, that the retreat was finally sounded in time\r\nto embark the remnants of the armies of the Alliance on board the\r\nwarships. Happily at the very hour when this was being done the\r\nweather broke again, and the ships of the Allied fleets were\r\ntherefore able to make their way to sea through storm and darkness,\r\nunmolested by the war-balloons.\r\n\r\nWhile the American press was teeming with columns of description\r\ntelegraphed at enormous cost from the seat of war, and with\r\nabsolutely misleading articles as to the policy of the League and the\r\nattitude of studious neutrality that was to be observed by the United\r\nStates Government, the dockyards, controlled directly and indirectly\r\nby the American Ring, were working night and day putting the\r\nfinishing touches to the flotilla of dynamite cruisers and other\r\nwar-vessels intended to carry out the plan revealed by Michael\r\nRoburoff on board the _Ithuriel_, after he had been taken off the\r\n_Aurania_ in the Mid-Atlantic.\r\n\r\nBriefly described, this was as follows:--Representative government in\r\nAmerica had by this time become a complete sham. The whole political\r\nmachinery and internal resources of the United States were now\r\nvirtually at the command of a great Ring of capitalists who, through\r\nthe medium of the huge monopolies which they controlled, and the\r\nenormous sums of money at their command, held the country in the\r\nhollow of their hand. These men were as totally devoid of all human\r\nfeeling or public sentiment as it was possible for human beings to\r\nbe. They had grown rich in virtue of their contempt of every\r\nprinciple of justice and mercy, and they had no other object in life\r\nthan to still further increase their gigantic hoards of wealth, and\r\nto multiply the enormous powers which they already wielded. The then\r\ncondition of affairs in Europe had presented them with such an\r\nopportunity as no other combination of circumstances could have given\r\nthem, and ignoring, as such wretches would naturally do, all ties of\r\nblood and kindred speech, they had determined to take advantage of\r\nthe situation to the utmost.\r\n\r\nIn the guise of the United States Government the Ring had concluded a\r\nsecret treaty with the commanders of the League, in virtue of which,\r\nat a stipulated point in the struggle, America was to declare war on\r\nBritain, invade Canada by land, and send to sea an immense flotilla\r\nof swift dynamite cruisers of tremendously destructive power, which\r\nhad been constructed openly in the Government dockyards, ostensibly\r\nfor coast defence, and secretly in private yards belonging to the\r\nvarious Corporations composing the Ring.\r\n\r\nThis flotilla was to co-operate with the fleet of the League as soon\r\nas England had been invaded, and complete the blockade of the British\r\nports. Were this once accomplished nothing could save Britain from\r\nstarvation into surrender, and the British Empire from disintegration\r\nand partition between the Ring and the Commanders of the League, who\r\nwould then practically divide the mastery of the world among them.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 4th of October the five words: \"The hour and the\r\nman,\" went flying over the wires from Washington throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of the North American Continent. The next morning\r\nhalf the industries of the United States were paralysed; all the\r\nlines of communication by telegraph and rail between the east and\r\nwest were severed, the shore ends of the Atlantic cables were cut, no\r\nnewspapers appeared, and every dockyard on the eastern coast was in\r\nthe hands of the Terrorists.\r\n\r\nTo complete the stupor produced by this swift succession of\r\nastounding events, when the sun rose an air-ship was seen floating\r\nhigh in the air over the ten arsenals of the United States--that is\r\nto say, over Portsmouth, Charlestown, Brooklyn, League Island, New\r\nLondon, Washington, Norfolk, Pensacola, Mare Island, and Port Royal,\r\nwhile two others held Chicago and St. Louis, the great railway\r\ncentres for the west and south, at their mercy, and the _Ithuriel_,\r\nwith a broad red flag flying from her stern, swept like a meteor\r\nalong the eastern coast from Maine to Florida.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to describe the condition of frenzied panic into which the\r\ninhabitants of the threatened cities, and even the whole of the\r\nEastern States were thrown by the events of that ever-memorable\r\nmorning, would be to essay an utterly hopeless task. From the\r\nmillionaire in his palace to the outcasts who swarmed in the slums,\r\nnot a man or a woman kept a cool head save those who were in the\r\ncouncils of the Terrorists. The blow had fallen with such stupefying\r\nsuddenness that as far as America was concerned the Revolution was\r\npractically accomplished before any one very well knew what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nOut of the midst of an apparently peaceful and industrious population\r\nfive millions of armed men had sprung in a single night. Factories\r\nand workshops had opened their doors, but none entered them; ships\r\nlay idle by the wharves, offices were deserted, and the great reels\r\nof paper hung motionless beside the paralysed machines which should\r\nhave converted them into newspapers.\r\n\r\nIt was not a strike, for no mere trade organisation could have\r\naccomplished such a miracle. It was the force born of the\r\naccumulation of twenty years of untiring labour striking one mighty\r\nblow which shattered the commercial fabric of a continent in a single\r\ninstant. Those who had been clerks or labourers yesterday, patient,\r\npeaceful, and law-abiding, were to-day soldiers, armed and\r\ndisciplined, and obeying with automatic regularity the unheard\r\ncommand of some unknown chief.\r\n\r\nThis of itself would have been enough to throw the United States into\r\na panic; but, worse than all, the presence of the air-ships, holding\r\nat their mercy the arsenals and the richest cities in the Eastern\r\nStates, proved that tremendous and all as it was, this was only a\r\nphase of some vast and mysterious cataclysm which might as easily\r\ninvolve the whole civilised world as it could overwhelm the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nBy noon, almost without striking a blow, every dynamite cruiser and\r\nwarship on the eastern coast had been seized and manned by the\r\nTerrorists. To the dismay of the authorities, it was found that more\r\nthan half the army and navy, officers and men alike, had obeyed the\r\nmysterious summons that had gone throughout the land the night\r\nbefore; and matters reached a climax when, as the clocks of\r\nWashington were striking twelve, the President himself was arrested\r\nin the White House.\r\n\r\nAll the streets of Washington were in the hands of the Terrorists,\r\nand at one o'clock Tremayne, after posting guards at all the\r\napproaches, entered the Senate, and in the name of Natas proclaimed\r\nthe Constitution of the United States null and void, and the\r\nGovernment dissolved.\r\n\r\nThen with a copy of the Constitution in his hand he proceeded to the\r\nsteps of the Capitol, and, in the presence of a vast throng of the\r\narmed members of the American Section, he proclaimed the Federation\r\nof the English-speaking races of the world, in virtue of their bonds\r\nof kindred blood and speech and common interests; and amidst a scene\r\nof the wildest enthusiasm called upon all who owned those bonds to\r\nforget the artificial divisions that had separated them into hostile\r\nnations and communities, and to follow the leadership of the\r\nBrotherhood to the conquest of the earth.\r\n\r\nThen in a few strong and simple phrases he exposed the subservience\r\nof the Government to the capitalist Ring, and described the inhuman\r\ncompact that it had entered into with the arch-enemies of national\r\nfreedom and personal liberty to crush the motherland of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon nations, and for the sake of sordid gain to rivet the\r\nfetters of oppression upon the limbs of the race which for a thousand\r\nyears had stood in the forefront of the battle for freedom.\r\n\r\nAs he concluded his appeal, one mighty shout of wrath and execration\r\nrose up to heaven from a million throats. He waited until this died\r\naway into silence, then, raising the copy of the Constitution above\r\nhis head, he cried in clear ringing tones--\r\n\r\n\"For a hundred and fifty years this has been boasted as the bulwark\r\nof liberty, and used as the instrument of social and commercial\r\noppression. The Republic of America has been governed, not by\r\npatriots and statesmen, but by millionaires and their hired political\r\npuppets. It is therefore a fraud and a sham, and deserves no longer\r\nto exist!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he tore the paper into fragments and cast them into the\r\nair amidst a storm of cheers and volley after volley of musketry.\r\nWhile the enthusiasm was at its height the _Ithuriel_ suddenly swept\r\ndownwards from the sky in full view of the mighty assemblage that\r\nswarmed round the Capitol. She was greeted with a roar of wondering\r\nwelcome, for her appearance was the fulfilment of a promise upon\r\nwhich the success of the Revolution in America had largely depended.\r\n\r\nThis was the promise, issued by Tremayne several days previously\r\nthrough the commanders of the various divisions of the Section, that\r\nas soon as the Anglo-Saxon Federation was proclaimed and accepted in\r\nAmerica, the whole Brotherhood throughout the world would fall into\r\nline with it, and place its aërial navy at the disposal of its\r\nleaders. Practically this was giving the empire of the world in\r\nexchange for a money-despotism, of which every one save the\r\nmillionaires and their servants had become heartily sick.\r\n\r\nThere were few who in their hearts did not believe the Republic to be\r\na colossal fraud, and therefore there were few who regretted it.\r\n\r\nThe _Ithuriel_ passed slowly over the heads of the wondering crowd,\r\nand came to a standstill alongside the steps on which Tremayne was\r\nstanding. The crowd saw a man on her deck shake hands with Tremayne\r\nand give him a folded paper. Then the air-ship swept gracefully\r\nupward again in a spiral curve until she hung motionless over the\r\ndome of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nAmidst a silence born of breathless interest to know the import of\r\nthis message from the sky, Tremayne opened the paper, glanced at its\r\ncontents, and handed it to the senior officer in command of the\r\nbrigades, who stood beside him. This man, a veteran who had grown\r\ngrey in the service of the Brotherhood, advanced with the open paper\r\nin his hand, and read out in a loud voice--\r\n\r\n    Natas sends greeting to the Brotherhood in America. The work has\r\n    been well done, and the reward of patient labour is at hand. This\r\n    is to name Alan Tremayne, Chief of the Central Executive, first\r\n    President of the Anglo-Saxon Federation throughout the world, and\r\n    to invest him with the supreme authority for the ordering of its\r\n    affairs. The aërial navy of the Brotherhood is placed at his\r\n    disposal to co-operate with the armies and fleets of the\r\n    Federation.\r\n\r\n      NATAS.\r\n\r\nWhen the mighty shout of acclamation which greeted the reading of\r\nthis commission had died away, Tremayne stepped forward again and\r\nspoke the few words that now remained to be said--\r\n\r\n\"I accept the office and all that it implies. The fate of the world\r\nlies in our hands, and as we decide it so will the future lot of\r\nhumanity be good or evil. The armies of the Franco-Slavonian League\r\nare now masters of the continent of Europe, and are preparing for the\r\ninvasion of Britain. The first use that I shall make of the authority\r\nnow vested in me will be to summon the Tsar in the name of the\r\nFederation to sheathe the sword at once, and relinquish his designs\r\non Britain. The moment that one of his soldiers sets foot on the\r\nsacred soil of our motherland I shall declare war upon him, and it\r\nshall be a war, not of conquest, but of extermination, and we will\r\nmake an end of tyranny on earth for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Now let those who are not on guard-duty go to their homes, and\r\nremember that they are now citizens of a greater realm than the\r\nUnited States, and endowed with more than national duties and\r\nresponsibilities. Let every man's person and property be respected,\r\nand let the penalty of all violence be death. Those who have plotted\r\nagainst the public welfare will be dealt with in due course, and\r\nyonder air-ship will be despatched with our message to the Tsar at\r\nsundown. Long live the Federation!\"\r\n\r\nMillions of throats took up the cry as the last words left his lips\r\nuntil it rolled away from the Capitol in mighty waves of sound,\r\nflowing along the crowded streets and overrunning the utmost confines\r\nof the capital.\r\n\r\nThus, without the loss of a hundred lives, and in a space of less\r\nthan twelve hours, was the Revolution in America accomplished. The\r\ntriumph of the Terrorists was as complete as it had been unexpected.\r\nMenaced by air and sea and land, the great centres of population made\r\nno resistance, and, when they learnt the true object of the\r\nRevolution, wanted to make none. No one really believed in the late\r\nGovernment, and every one in his soul hated and despised the\r\nmillionaires.\r\n\r\nThere was no bond between them and their fellow-men but money, and\r\nthe moment that was snapped they were looked upon in their true\r\nnature as criminals and outcasts from the pale of humanity. By\r\nsundown, when the _Ithuriel_ left for the seat of war, the members of\r\nthe Ring and those of the late Government who refused to acknowledge\r\nthe Federation were lodged in prison, and news had been received from\r\nMontreal that the simultaneous rising of the Canadian Section had\r\nbeen completely successful, and that all the railways and arsenals\r\nand ships of war were in the hands of the Terrorists, so completing\r\nthe capture of the North American continent.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Federation and his faithful subordinates went to\r\nwork, without losing an hour, to reorganise as far as was necessary\r\nthe internal affairs of the continent of which they had so suddenly\r\nbecome the undisputed masters. There was some trouble with the\r\nBritish authorities in Canada, who, from mistaken motives of duty to\r\nthe mother country, at first refused to recognise the Federation.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this was that Tremayne went north the next day and\r\nhad an interview with the Governor-General at Montreal. At the same\r\ntime he ordered six air-ships and twenty-five dynamite cruisers to\r\nblockade the St. Lawrence and the eastern ports. The Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway and the telegraph lines to the west were already in the hands\r\nof the Terrorists, and a million men were under arms waiting his\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nA very brief explanation, therefore, sufficed to show the Governor\r\nthat forcible resistance would not only be the purest madness, but\r\nthat it would also seriously interfere with the working of the great\r\nscheme of Federation, the object of which was, not merely to place\r\nBritain in the first place among the nations, but to make the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race the one dominant power in the whole world.\r\n\r\nTo all the Governor's objections on the score of loyalty to the\r\nBritish Crown, Tremayne, who heard him to the end without\r\ninterruption, simply replied in a tone that precluded all further\r\nargument--\r\n\r\n\"The day of states and empires, and therefore of loyalty to\r\nsovereigns, has gone by. The history of nations is the history of\r\nintrigue, quarrelling, and bloodshed, and we are determined to put a\r\nstop to warfare for good and all. We hold in our hands the only power\r\nthat can thwart the designs of the League and avert an era of tyranny\r\nand retrogression. That power we intend to use whether the British\r\nGovernment likes it or not.\r\n\r\n\"We shall save Britain, if necessary, in spite of her rulers. If they\r\nstand in the way, so much the worse for them. They will be called\r\nupon to resign in favour of the Federation and its Executive within\r\nthe next seven days. If they consent, the forces of the League will\r\nnever cross the Straits of Dover. If they refuse we shall allow\r\nBritain to taste the results of their choice, and then settle the\r\nmatter in our own way.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day the Governor dissolved the Canadian Legislatures \"under\r\nprotest,\" and retired into private life for the present. He felt that\r\nit was no time to argue with a man who had millions of men behind\r\nhim, to say nothing of an aërial fleet which alone could reduce\r\nMontreal to ruins in twelve hours.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging matters in Canada the President returned to\r\nWashington in the _Ariel_, which he had taken into his personal\r\nservice for the present, and set about disposing of the Ring and\r\nthose members of the late Government who were most deeply implicated\r\nin the secret alliance with the leaders of the League. When the facts\r\nof this scheme were made public they raised such a storm of popular\r\nindignation, that if those responsible for it had been turned loose\r\nin the streets of Washington they would have been torn to pieces like\r\nvermin.\r\n\r\nAs it was, however, they were placed upon their trial before a\r\nCommission of seven members of the Inner Circle of the American\r\nSection, presided over by the President. Their guilt was speedily\r\nproved beyond the shadow of a doubt. Documents, memoranda, and\r\ntelegrams were produced by men who had seemed their most trusted\r\nservants, but had been in reality members of the Brotherhood told off\r\nto unearth their schemes.\r\n\r\nCyphers were translated which showed that they had practically sold\r\nthe resources of the country in advance to the Tsar and his allies,\r\nand that they were only waiting the signal to declare war without\r\nwarning and without cause upon Britain, blockade her ports, and\r\nstarve her into surrender and acceptance of any terms that the\r\nvictors might choose to impose. Last of all, the terms of the bargain\r\nbetween the League and the Ring were produced, signed by the late\r\nPresident and the Secretary of State, and countersigned by the\r\nRussian Minister at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Court sat for three days, and reassembled on the fourth to\r\ndeliver its verdict and sentence. Fifteen members of the late\r\nGovernment, including the President, the Vice-President, and the\r\nSecretary of State, and twenty-four great capitalists composing the\r\nRing, were found guilty of giving and receiving bribes, directly and\r\nindirectly, and of betraying and conspiring to betray the confidence\r\nof the American people in its elected representatives, and also of\r\nconspiring to make war without due cause on a friendly Power for\r\npurely commercial reasons.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock on the morning of the 9th of October the President\r\nof the Federation rose in the Senate House, amidst breathless\r\nsilence, to pronounce the sentence of the Court.\r\n\r\n\"All the accused,\" he said, speaking in slow, deliberate tones, \"have\r\nbeen proved guilty of such treason against their own race and the\r\nwelfare of humanity as no men ever were guilty of before in all the\r\ndisreputable history of state-craft. In view of the suffering and\r\nmisery to millions of individuals, and the irreparable injury to the\r\ncause of civilisation that would have resulted from the success of\r\ntheir schemes, it would be impossible for human wit to devise any\r\npunishment which in itself would be adequate. The sentence of the\r\nCourt is the extreme penalty known to human justice--Death!\"\r\n\r\nA shudder passed through the vast assembly as he pronounced the\r\nominous word, and the accused, who but a few days before had looked\r\nupon the world as their footstool, gazed with blanched faces and\r\nterror-stricken eyes upon each other. He paused for a moment, and\r\nlooked sternly upon them. Then he went on--\r\n\r\n\"But the Federation does not seek a punishment of revenge, but of\r\njustice; nor shall its first act of government be the shedding of\r\nblood, however guilty. Therefore, as President I override the\r\nsentence of death, and instead condemn you, who have been proved\r\nguilty of this unspeakable crime, to confiscation of the wealth that\r\nyou have acquired so unscrupulously and used so mercilessly, and to\r\nperpetual banishment with your wives and families, who have shared\r\nthe profits of your infamous traffic.\r\n\r\n\"You will be at once conveyed to Kodiak Island, off the south coast\r\nof Alaska, and landed there. Once every six months you will be\r\nvisited by a steamer, which will supply you with the necessaries of\r\nlife, and the original penalty of death will be the immediate\r\npunishment of any one of you who attempts to return to a world of\r\nwhich you from this moment cease to be citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence was carried out without an hour's delay. The exiles,\r\nwith their wives and families, were placed under a strong guard in a\r\nspecial train, which conveyed them from Washington _viâ_ St. Louis to\r\nSan Francisco, where they were transferred to a steamer which took\r\nthem to the lonely and desolate island in the frozen North which was\r\nto be their home for the rest of their lives. They were followed by\r\nthe execrations of a whole people and the regrets of none save the\r\nmoney-worshippers who had respected them, not as men, but as\r\nincarnations of the purchasing power of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe huge fortunes which they had amassed, amounting in the aggregate\r\nto more than three hundred millions in English money, were placed in\r\nthe public treasury for the immediate purposes of the war which the\r\nFederation was about to wage for the empire of the world. All their\r\nreal estate property was transferred to the various municipalities in\r\nwhich it was situated, and their rents devoted to the relief of\r\ntaxation, while the railways and other enterprises which they had\r\ncontrolled were declared public property, and placed in the hands of\r\nboards of management composed of their own officials.\r\n\r\nWithin a week everything was working as smoothly as though no\r\nRevolution had ever taken place. All officials whose honesty there\r\nwas no reason to suspect were retained in their offices, while those\r\nwho were dismissed were replaced without any friction. All the\r\naffairs of government were conducted upon purely business principles,\r\njust as though the country had been a huge commercial concern, save\r\nfor the fact that the chief object was efficiency and not\r\nprofit-making.\r\n\r\nMoney was abundantly plentiful, and the necessaries of life were\r\ncheaper than they had ever been before. Perhaps the principal reason\r\nfor this happy state of affairs was the fact that law and politics\r\nhad suddenly ceased to be trades at which money could be made. People\r\nwere amazed at the rapidity with which public business was\r\ntransacted.\r\n\r\nThe President and his Council had at one stroke abrogated every civil\r\nand criminal law known to the old Constitution, and proclaimed in\r\ntheir place a simple, comprehensive code which was practically\r\nidentical with the Decalogue. To this a final clause was added,\r\nstating that those who could not live without breaking any of these\r\nlaws would not be considered as fit to live in civilised society, and\r\nwould therefore be effectively removed from the companionship of\r\ntheir fellows.\r\n\r\nWhile the internal affairs of the Federation in America were being\r\nthus set in order, events had been moving rapidly in other parts of\r\nthe world. The Tsar, the King of Italy, and General le Gallifet, who\r\nwas now Dictator of France in all but name, were masters of the\r\ncontinent of Europe. The Anglo-Teutonic Alliance was a thing of the\r\npast. Germany, Austria, and Turkey were completely crushed, and the\r\nminor Powers had succumbed.\r\n\r\nBritain, crippled by the terrible cost in ships and men of the\r\nvictory of the Nile, had evacuated the Mediterranean after\r\ndismantling the fortifications of Gibraltar and Malta, and had\r\nconcentrated the remains of her fleets in the home waters, to prepare\r\nfor the invasion which was now inevitable as soon as fair winds and\r\nfine weather made it possible for the war-balloons of the League to\r\ncross the water and co-operate with the invading forces.\r\n\r\nThe Tsar, as had been expected, had not even deigned to reply to\r\nTremayne's summons to disarm, and so the last arrangements for\r\nbringing the forces of the Federation into action at the proper time\r\nwere pushed on with the utmost speed. The blockade of the American\r\nand Canadian coasts was rigidly maintained, and no vessels allowed to\r\nenter or leave any of the ports. All the warships of the League had\r\nbeen withdrawn from the Atlantic, and the great ocean highway\r\nremained unploughed by a single keel.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October the _Ithuriel_ had returned from her second\r\ntrip to the West, with the refusal of the British Government to\r\nrecognise the Federation as a duly constituted Power, or to have any\r\ndealings with its leaders. \"Great Britain,\" the reply concluded,\r\n\"will stand or fall alone; and even in the event of ultimate defeat,\r\nthe King of England will prefer to make terms with the sovereigns\r\nopposed to him rather than with those whose acts have proved them to\r\nbe beyond the pale of the law of nations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Tremayne to Arnold, as he read the royal words, \"the\r\npolicy which lost the American Colonies for the sake of an idea still\r\nrules at Westminster, it seems. But I'm not going to let the old Lion\r\nbe strangled in his den for all that.\r\n\r\n\"Natas was right when he said that Britain would have to pass through\r\nthe fire before she would accept the Federation, and so I suppose she\r\nmust, more's the pity. Still, perhaps it will be all for the best in\r\nthe long run. You can't expect to root up a thousand-year-old oak as\r\neasily as a mushroom that only came up the day before yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now time to return to Britain, to the land which the course of\r\nevents had so far appeared to single out as the battle-ground upon\r\nwhich was to be fought the Armageddon of the Western World--that\r\nconflict of the giants, the issue of which was to decide whether the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race was still to remain in the forefront of civilisation\r\nand progress, or whether it was to fall, crushed and broken, beneath\r\nthe assaults of enemies descending upon the motherland of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon nations; whether the valour and personal devotion, which\r\nfor a thousand years had scarcely known a defeat by flood or field,\r\nwas still to pursue its course of victory, or whether it was to\r\nsuccumb to weight of numbers and mechanical discipline, reinforced by\r\nmeans of assault and destruction which so far had turned the\r\nworld-war of 1904 into a succession of colossal and unparalleled\r\nbutcheries, such as had never been known before in the history of\r\nhuman strife.\r\n\r\nWhen the Allied fleets, bearing the remains of the British and German\r\narmies which had been driven out of the Netherlands, reached England,\r\nand the news of the crowning disaster of the war in Europe was\r\npublished in detail in the newspapers, the popular mind seemed\r\nsuddenly afflicted with a paralysis of stupefaction.\r\n\r\nMen looked back over the long series of triumphs in which British\r\nvalour and British resolution had again and again proved themselves\r\ninvulnerable to the assaults of overwhelming numbers. They thought of\r\nthe glories of the Peninsula, of the unbreakable strength of the thin\r\nred line at Waterloo, of the magnificent madness of Balaclava, and\r\nthe invincible steadiness and discipline that had made Inkermann a\r\nword to be remembered with pride as long as the English name endured.\r\n\r\nThen their thoughts reverted to the immediate past, and they heard\r\nthe shock of colossal armaments, compared with which the armies of\r\nthe past appeared but pigmies in strength. They saw empires defended\r\nby millions of soldiers crushed in a few weeks, and a wave of\r\nconquest sweep in one unbroken roll from end to end of a continent in\r\nless time than it would have taken Napoleon or Wellington to have\r\nfought a single campaign. Huge fortresses, rendered, as men had\r\nbelieved, impregnable by the employment of every resource known to\r\nthe most advanced military science, had been reduced to heaps of\r\ndefenceless ruins in a few hours by a bombardment, under which their\r\nmagnificent guns had lain as impotent as though they had been the\r\nculverins of three hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like some hideous nightmare of the nations, in which Europe\r\nhad gone mad, revelling in superhuman bloodshed and destruction,--a\r\nconflict in which more than earthly forces had been let loose,\r\naccomplishing a carnage so immense that the mind could only form a\r\ndim and imperfect conception of it. And now this red tide of\r\ndesolation had swept up to the western verge of the Continent, and\r\nwas there gathering strength and volume day by day against the hour\r\nwhen it should burst and oversweep the narrow strip of water which\r\nseparated the inviolate fields of England from the blackened and\r\nblood-stained waste that it had left behind it from the Russian\r\nfrontier to the German Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible, and yet it was true. The first line of defence,\r\nthe hitherto invincible fleet, magnificently as it had been managed,\r\nand heroically as it had been fought, had failed in the supreme hour\r\nof trial. It had failed, not because the sailors of Britain had done\r\ntheir duty less valiantly than they had done in the days of Rodney\r\nand Nelson, but simply because the conditions of naval warfare had\r\nbeen entirely changed, because the personal equation had been almost\r\neliminated from the problem of battle, and because the new warfare of\r\nthe seas had been waged rather with machinery than with men.\r\n\r\nIn all the war not a single battle had been fought at close quarters;\r\nthere had been plenty of instances of brilliant manoeuvring, of\r\ntorpedo-boats running the gauntlet and hurling their deadly missiles\r\nagainst the sides of battleships and cruisers, and of ships rammed\r\nand sunk in a few instants by consummately-handled opponents; but the\r\ndays of boarding and cutting out, of night surprises and fire-ships,\r\nhad gone by for ever.\r\n\r\nThe irresistible artillery with which modern science had armed the\r\nwarships of all nations had made these feats impossible, and so had\r\nplaced the valour which achieved them out of court. Within the last\r\nfew weeks scarcely a day had passed but had witnessed the return of\r\nsome mighty ironclad or splendid cruiser, which had set out a miracle\r\nof offensive and defensive strength, little better than a floating\r\nruin, wrecked and shattered almost beyond recognition by the awful\r\nbattle-storm through which she had passed.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent armament which had held the Atlantic route had come\r\nback represented only by a few crippled ships almost unfit for any\r\nfurther service. True, they and those which never returned had\r\nrendered a splendid account of themselves before the enemy, but the\r\nfact remained--they were not defeated, but they were no longer able\r\nto perform the Titanic task which had been allotted to them.\r\n\r\nSo, too, with the Mediterranean fleet, which, so far as sea-fighting\r\nwas concerned, had achieved the most splendid triumph of the war. It\r\nhad completely destroyed the enemy opposed to it, but the victory had\r\nbeen purchased at such a terrible price that, but for the squadron\r\nwhich had come to its aid, it would hardly have been able to reach\r\nhome in safety.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the lesson of the struggle on the sea had been, that\r\nmodern artillery was just as effective whether fired by Englishmen,\r\nFrenchmen, or Russians; that where a torpedo struck a warship was\r\ncrippled, no matter what the nationality or the relative valour of\r\nher crew; and that where once the ram found its mark the ship that it\r\nstruck went down, no matter what flag she was flying.\r\n\r\nAnd then, behind and beyond all that was definitely known in England\r\nof the results of the war, there were vague rumours of calamities and\r\ncatastrophes in more distant parts of the world, which seemed to\r\npromise nothing less than universal anarchy, and the submergence of\r\ncivilisation under some all-devouring wave of barbarism.\r\n\r\nAll regular communications with the East had been stopped for several\r\nweeks; that India was lost, was guessed by intuition rather than\r\nknown as a certainty. Australia was as isolated from Britain as\r\nthough it had been on another planet, and now every one of the\r\nAtlantic cables had suddenly ceased to respond to the stimulus of the\r\nelectric current. No ships came from the East, or West, or South. The\r\nBritish ports were choked with fleets of useless merchantmen, to\r\nwhich the markets of the world were no longer open.\r\n\r\nSome few venturesome craft that had set out to explore the now silent\r\nocean had never returned, and every warship that could be made fit\r\nfor service was imperatively needed to meet the now inevitable attack\r\non the shores of the English Channel and the southern portions of the\r\nNorth Sea. Only one messenger had arrived from the outside world\r\nsince the remains of Admiral Beresford's fleet had returned from the\r\nMediterranean, and she had come, not by land or sea, but through the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of October an air-ship had been seen flying at an\r\nincredible speed across the south of England. She had reached London,\r\nand touched the ground during the night on Hampstead Heath; the next\r\nday she had descended again in the same place, taken a single man on\r\nboard, and then vanished into space again. What her errand had been\r\nis well known to the reader; but outside the members of the Cabinet\r\nCouncil no one in England, save the King and his Ministers, knew the\r\nobject of her mission.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen days after that event the enemy across the water made no\r\nsign, although from the coast of Kent round about Deal and Dover\r\ncould be seen fleets of transports and war-vessels hurrying along the\r\nFrench coast, and on clear days a thousand telescopes turned towards\r\nthe French shore made visible the ominous clusters of moving black\r\nspots above the land, which betokened the presence of the terrible\r\nmachines which had wrought such havoc on the towns and fortresses of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIt was only the calm before the final outburst of the storm. The Tsar\r\nand his allies were marshalling their hosts for the invasion, and\r\ncollecting transports and fleets of war-vessels to convoy them. For\r\nseveral days strong north-westerly gales had made the sea impassable\r\nfor the war-balloons, as though to the very last the winds and waves\r\nwere conspiring to defend their ancient mistress. But this could not\r\nlast for ever.\r\n\r\nSooner or later the winds must sink or change, and then these\r\nwar-hawks of the air would wing their flight across the silver\r\nstreak, and Portsmouth, and Dover, and London would be as defenceless\r\nbeneath their attack as Berlin, Vienna, and Hamburg had been. And\r\nafter them would come the millions of the League, descending like a\r\nlocust swarm upon the fields of eastern England; and after that would\r\ncome the deluge.\r\n\r\nBut the old Lion of the Seas was not skulking in his lair, or\r\ntrembling at the advent of his enemies, however numerous and mighty\r\nthey might be. On sea not a day passed but some daring raid was made\r\non the transports passing to and fro in the narrow seas, and all the\r\nwhile a running fight was kept up with cruisers and battleships that\r\napproached too near to the still inviolate shore. So surely as they\r\ndid so the signals flashed along the coast; and if they escaped at\r\nall from the fierce sortie that they provoked, it was with\r\nshot-riddled sides and battered top-works, sure signs that the Lion\r\nstill had claws, and could strike home with them.\r\n\r\nOn shore, from Land's End to John o' Groats, and from Holyhead to the\r\nForelands, everything that could be done was being done to prepare\r\nfor the struggle with the invader. It must, however, be confessed\r\nthat, in comparison with the enormous forces of the League, the ranks\r\nof the defenders were miserably scanty. Forty years of universal\r\nmilitary service on the Continent had borne their fruits.\r\n\r\nSoldiers are not made in a few weeks or months; and where the League\r\nhad millions in the field, Britain, even counting the remnant of her\r\nGerman allies, that had been brought over from Antwerp, could hardly\r\nmuster hundreds of thousands. All told, there were little more than a\r\nmillion men available for the defence of the country; and should the\r\nlanding of the invaders be successfully effected, not less than six\r\nmillions of men, trained to the highest efficiency, and flushed with\r\na rapid succession of unparalleled victories, would be hurled against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis was the legitimate outcome of the policy to which Britain had\r\nadhered since first she had maintained a standing army, instead of\r\npursuing the ancient policy of making every man a soldier, which had\r\nwon the triumphs of Creçy and Agincourt. She had trusted everything\r\nto her sea-line of defence. Now that was practically broken, and it\r\nseemed inevitable that her second line, by reason of its miserable\r\ninadequacy, should fail her in a trial which no one had ever dreamt\r\nit would have to endure.\r\n\r\nA very grave aspect was given to the situation by the fact that the\r\ngreat mass of the industrial population seemed strangely indifferent\r\nto the impending catastrophe which was hanging over the land. It\r\nappeared to be impossible to make them believe that an invasion of\r\nBritain was really at hand, and that the hour had come when every man\r\nwould be called upon to fight for the preservation of his own hearth\r\nand home.\r\n\r\nVague threats of \"eating the Russians alive\" if they ever did dare to\r\ncome, were heard on every hand; but beyond this, and apart from the\r\nregular army and the volunteers, men went about their daily\r\navocations very much as usual, grumbling at the ever-increasing price\r\nof food, and here and there breaking out into bread riots wherever it\r\nwas suspected that some wealthy man was trying to corner food for his\r\nown commercial benefit, but making no serious or combined efforts to\r\nprepare for a general rising in case the threatened invasion became a\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general state of affairs in Britain when, on the night\r\nof the 27th of October, the north-west gales sank suddenly to a calm,\r\nand the dawn of the 28th brought the news from Dover to London that\r\nthe war-balloons of the League had taken the air, and were crossing\r\nthe Straits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF DOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the war of 1904, it had been an undisputed axiom in naval\r\nwarfare that a territorial attack upon an enemy's coast by a fleet\r\nwas foredoomed to failure unless that enemy's fleet had been either\r\ncrippled beyond effective action, or securely blockaded in distant\r\nports. As an axiom secondary to this, it was also held that it would\r\nbe impossible for an invading force, although convoyed by a powerful\r\nfleet, to make good its footing upon any portion of a hostile coast\r\ndefended by forts mounting heavy long-range guns.\r\n\r\nThese principles have held good throughout the history of naval\r\nwarfare from the time when Sir Walter Raleigh first laid them down in\r\nthe early portion of his _History of the World_, written after the\r\ndestruction of the Spanish Armada.\r\n\r\nBut now two elements had been introduced which altered the conditions\r\nof naval warfare even more radically than one of them had changed\r\nthose of military warfare. Had it not been for this the attack upon\r\nthe shores of England made by the commanders of the League would\r\nprobably either have been a failure, or it would have stopped at a\r\ndemonstration of force, as did that of the great Napoleon in 1803.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the Kentish coast selected for the attack was that\r\nstretching from Folkestone to Deal, and it would perhaps have been\r\ndifficult to find in the whole world any portion of sea-coast more\r\nstrongly defended than this was on the morning of October 28, 1904;\r\nand yet, as the event proved, the fortresses which lined it were as\r\nuseless and impotent for defence as the old Martello towers of a\r\nhundred and fifty years before would have been.\r\n\r\nAs the war-balloons rose into the air from the heights above\r\nBoulogne, good telescopes at Dover enabled their possessors to count\r\nno less than seventy-five of them. Fifty of these were quite newly\r\nconstructed, and were of a much improved type, as they had been built\r\nin view of the practical experience gained by the first fleet.\r\n\r\nThis aërial fleet divided into three squadrons; one, numbering\r\ntwenty-five, steered south-westward in the direction of Folkestone,\r\ntwelve shaped their course towards Deal, and the remaining\r\nthirty-eight steered directly across the Straits to Dover. As they\r\napproached the English coast they continually rose, until by the time\r\nthey had reached the land, aided by the light south-easterly breeze\r\nwhich was then blowing, they floated at a height of more than five\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nAll this while not a warship or a transport had put to sea. The whole\r\nfleet of the League lay along the coast of France between Calais and\r\nDieppe, under the protection of shore batteries so powerful that it\r\nwould have been madness for the British fleet to have assumed the\r\noffensive with regard to them. With the exception of two squadrons\r\nreserved for a possible attack upon Portsmouth and Harwich, all that\r\nremained from the disasters and costly victories of the war of the\r\nonce mighty British naval armament was massed together for the\r\ndefence of that portion of the coast which would evidently have to\r\nbear the brunt of the attack of the League.\r\n\r\nRanged along the coast from Folkestone to Deal was an armament\r\nconsisting of forty-five battleships of the first, second, and third\r\nclasses, supported by fifteen coast-defence ironclads, seventy\r\narmoured and thirty-two unarmoured cruisers, forty gunboats, and a\r\nhundred and fifty torpedo-boats.\r\n\r\nSuch was the still magnificent fleet that patrolled the waters of the\r\nnarrow sea,--a fleet as impotent for the time being as a flotilla of\r\nThames steamboats would have been in face of the tactics employed\r\nagainst it by the League. Had the enemy's fleet but come out into the\r\nopen, as it would have been compelled to do under the old conditions\r\nof warfare, to fight its way across the narrow strip of water, there\r\nis little doubt but that the issue of the day would have been very\r\ndifferent, and that what had been left of it would have been driven\r\nback, shattered and defeated, to the shelter of the French shore\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nBut, in accordance with the invariable tactics of the League, the\r\nfirst and most deadly assault was delivered from the air. The\r\nwar-balloons stationed themselves above the fortifications on land,\r\ntotally ignoring the presence of the fleet, and a few minutes after\r\nten o'clock began to rain their deadly hail of explosives down upon\r\nthem. Fifteen were placed over Dover Castle, and five over the fort\r\non the Admiralty Pier, while the rest were distributed over the town\r\nand the forts on the hills above it. In an hour everything was in a\r\nstate of the most horrible confusion. The town was on fire in a\r\nhundred places from the effects of the fire-shells. The Castle hill\r\nseemed as if it had been suddenly turned into a volcano; jets of\r\nbright flame kept leaping up from its summit and sides, followed by\r\nthunderous explosions and masses of earth and masonry hurled into the\r\nair, mingled with guns and fragments of human bodies.\r\n\r\nThe end of the Admiralty Pier, with its huge blocks of stone wrenched\r\nasunder and pulverised by incessant explosions of dynamite and\r\nemmensite, collapsed and subsided into the sea, carrying fort, guns,\r\nand magazine with it; and all along the height of the Shakespeare\r\ncliff the earthworks had been blown up and scattered into dust, and a\r\nhuge portion of the cliff itself had been blasted out and hurled down\r\non to the beach.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the victims of this terrible assault had, in the nature of\r\nthe case, been able to do nothing but keep up a vertical fire, in the\r\nhope of piercing the gas envelopes of the balloons, and so bringing\r\nthem to the earth. For more than an hour this fusilade produced no\r\neffect; but at length the concentrated fire of several Maxim and\r\nNordenfelt guns, projecting a hail of missiles into the sky, brought\r\nabout a result which was even more disastrous to the town than it was\r\nto its assailants.\r\n\r\nFour of the aerostats came within the zone swept by the bullets.\r\nRiddled through and through, their gas-holders collapsed, and their\r\ncars plunged downwards from a height of more than 5000 feet. A few\r\nseconds later four frightful explosions burst forth in different\r\nparts of the town, for the four cargoes exploded simultaneously as\r\nthey struck the earth.\r\n\r\nThe emmensite and dynamite tore whole streets of houses to fragments,\r\nand hurled them far and wide into the air, to fall back again on\r\nother parts of the town, and at the same time the fire-shells\r\nignited, and set the ruins blazing like so many furnaces. No more\r\nshots were fired into the air after that.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but for British valour to bow to the\r\ninevitable, and evacuate the town and what remained of its\r\nfortifications; and so with sad and heavy hearts the remnant of the\r\nbrave defenders turned their faces inland, leaving Dover to its fate.\r\nMeanwhile exactly the same havoc had been wrought upon Folkestone and\r\nDeal. Hour after hour the merciless work continued, until by three\r\no'clock in the afternoon there was not a gun left upon the whole\r\nrange of coast that was capable of firing a shot.\r\n\r\nAll this time the ammunition tenders of the aërial fleet had been\r\nwinging their way to and fro across the Strait constantly renewing\r\nthe shells of the war-balloons.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it began to grow dusk the naval battle commenced.\r\nNumerically speaking the attacking force was somewhat inferior to\r\nthat of the defenders, but now the second element, which so\r\ncompletely altered the tactics of sea fighting, was for the first\r\ntime in the war brought into play.\r\n\r\nAs the battleships of the League steamed out to engage the opponents,\r\nwho were thirsting to avenge the destruction that had been wrought\r\nupon the land, a small flotilla of twenty-five insignificant-looking\r\nlittle craft, with neither masts nor funnels, and looking more like\r\nhalf-submerged elongated turtles than anything else, followed in tow\r\nclose under their quarters. Hardly had the furious cannonade broken\r\nout into thunder and flame along the two opposing lines, than these\r\nstrange craft sank gently and silently beneath the waves. They were\r\nsubmarine vessels belonging to the French navy, an improved type of\r\nthe _Zédé_ class, which had been in existence for more than ten\r\nyears.[1]\r\n\r\nThese vessels were capable of sinking to a depth of twenty feet, and\r\nremaining for four hours without returning to the surface. They were\r\npropelled by twin screws worked by electricity at a speed of twenty\r\nknots, and were provided with an electric searchlight, which enabled\r\nthem to find the hulls of hostile ships in the dark.\r\n\r\nEach carried three torpedoes, which could be launched from a tube\r\nforward so as to strike the hull of the doomed ship from beneath. As\r\nsoon as the torpedo was discharged the submarine boat spun round on\r\nher heel and headed away at full speed in an opposite direction out\r\nof the area of the explosion.\r\n\r\nThe effects of such terrible and, indeed, irresistible engines of\r\nnaval warfare were soon made manifest upon the ships of the British\r\nfleet. In the heat of the battle, with every gun in action, and\r\nraining a hail of shot and shell upon her adversary, a great\r\nbattleship would receive an unseen blow, struck in the dark upon her\r\nmost vulnerable part, a huge column of water would rise up from under\r\nher side, and a few minutes later the splendid fabric would heel over\r\nand go down like a floating volcano, to be quenched by the waves that\r\nclosed over her.\r\n\r\nBut as if it were not enough that the defending fleet should be\r\nattacked from the surface of the water and the depths of the sea, the\r\nwar-balloons, winging their way out from the scene of ruin that they\r\nhad wrought on shore, soon began to take their part in the work of\r\ndeath and destruction.\r\n\r\nEach of them was provided with a mirror set a little in front of the\r\nbow of the car, at an angle which could be varied according to the\r\nelevation. A little forward of the centre of the car was a tube fixed\r\non a level with the centre of the mirror. The ship selected for\r\ndestruction was brought under the car, and the speed of the balloon\r\nwas regulated so that the ship was relatively stationary to it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the glare from one of the funnels could be seen through\r\nthe tube reflected in the centre of the mirror, a trap was sprung in\r\nthe floor of the car, and a shell charged with dynamite, which, it\r\nwill be remembered, explodes vertically downwards, was released, and,\r\nwhere the calculations were accurately made, passed down the funnel\r\nand exploded in the interior of the vessel, bursting her boilers and\r\nreducing her to a helpless wreck at a single stroke.\r\n\r\nEvery time this horribly ingenious contrivance was successfully\r\nbrought into play a battleship or a cruiser was either sunk or\r\nreduced to impotence. In order to make their aim the surer, the\r\naerostats descended to within three hundred yards of their prey, and\r\nwhere the missile failed to pass through the funnel it invariably\r\nstruck the deck close to it, tearing up the armour sheathing, and\r\nwrecking the funnel itself so completely that the steaming-power of\r\nthe vessel was very seriously reduced.\r\n\r\nAll night long the battle raged incessantly along a semicircle some\r\ntwelve miles long, the centre of which was Dover. Crowds of anxious\r\nwatchers on the shore watched the continuous flashes of the guns\r\nthrough the darkness, varied ever and anon by some tremendous\r\nexplosion which told the fate of a warship that had fired her last\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nAll night long the incessant thunder of the battle rolled to and fro\r\nalong the echoing coast, and when morning broke the light dawned upon\r\na scene of desolation and destruction on sea and shore such as had\r\nnever been witnessed before in the history of warfare. On land were\r\nthe smoking ruins of houses, still smouldering in the remains of the\r\nfires which had consumed them; forts which twenty-four hours before\r\nhad grinned defiance at the enemy were shapeless heaps of earth and\r\nstone, and armour-plating torn into great jagged fragments; and on\r\nsea were a few half-crippled wrecks, the remains of the British\r\nfleet, with their flags still flying, and such guns as were not\r\ndisabled firing their last rounds at the victorious foe.\r\n\r\nTo the eastward of these about half the fleet of the League, in but\r\nlittle better condition, was advancing in now overwhelming force upon\r\nthem, and behind these again a swarm of troopships and transports\r\nwere heading out from the French shore. About an hour after dawn the\r\n_Centurion_, the last of the British battleships, was struck by one\r\nof the submarine torpedoes, broke in two, and went down with her flag\r\nflying and her guns blazing away to the last moment. So ended the\r\nbattle of Dover, the most disastrous sea-fight in the history of the\r\nworld, and the death-struggle of the Mistress of the Seas.\r\n\r\nThe last news of the tremendous tragedy reached the now\r\npanic-stricken capital half an hour before the receipt of similar\r\ntidings from Harwich, announcing the destruction of the defending\r\nfleet and forts, and the capture of the town by exactly the same\r\nmeans as those employed against Dover. Nothing now lay between London\r\nand the invading forces but the utterly inadequate army and the lines\r\nof fortifications, which could not be expected to offer any more\r\neffective resistance to the assault of the war-balloons than had\r\nthose of the three towns on the Kentish coast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The Naval Annual_ for 1893 mentions two types of\r\nsubmarine boats, the _Zédé_ and the _Goubet_, both belonging to the\r\nFrench navy, which had then been tried with success. The same work\r\nmentions no such vessels belonging to Britain, nor yet any prospect\r\nof her possessing one. The effects described here as produced by\r\nthese terrible machines are little, if at all, exaggerated.

It had been a month of\r\nincessant fighting, of battles by day and night, of heroic defences\r\nand dearly-bought victories, but still of constant triumphs and\r\nirresistible progress for the ever-increasing legions of the League.\r\nFrom sunrise to sunrise the roar of artillery, the rattle of\r\nmusketry, and the clash of steel had never ceased to sound to the\r\nnorth and south of London as, over battlefield after battlefield, the\r\ntwo hosts which had poured in constant streams through Harwich and\r\nDover had fought their way, literally mile by mile, towards the\r\ncapital of the modern world.\r\n\r\nDay and night the fighting never stopped. As soon as two hostile\r\ndivisions had fought each other to a standstill, and from sheer\r\nweariness of the flesh the battle died down in one part of the huge\r\narena, the flame sprang up in another, and raged on with ever renewed\r\nfury. Outnumbered four and five to one in every engagement, and with\r\nthe terrible war-balloons raining death on them from the clouds, the\r\nBritish armies had eclipsed all the triumphs of the long array of\r\ntheir former victories by the magnificent devotion that they showed\r\nin the hour of what seemed to be the death-struggle of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe glories of Inkermann and Balaclava, of Albuera and Waterloo,\r\npaled before the achievements of the whole-souled heroism displayed\r\nby the British soldiery standing, as it were, with its back to the\r\nwall, and fighting, not so much with any hope of victory, for that\r\nwas soon seen to be a physical impossibility, but with the invincible\r\ndetermination not to permit the invader to advance on London save\r\nover the dead bodies of its defenders.\r\n\r\nSuch a gallant defence had never been made before in the face of such\r\nirresistible odds. When the soldiers of the League first set foot on\r\nBritish soil the defending armies of the North and South had, with\r\nthe greatest exertions, been brought up to a fighting strength of\r\nabout twelve hundred thousand men. So stubborn had been the heroism\r\nwith which they had disputed the progress of their enemies that by\r\nthe time that the guns of the League were planted on the heights that\r\ncommanded the Metropolis, more than a million and a half of men had\r\ngone down under the hail of British bullets and the rush of British\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\nOf all the battlefields of this the bloodiest war in the history of\r\nhuman strife, none had been so deeply dyed with blood as had been the\r\nfair and fertile English gardens and meadows over which the hosts of\r\nthe League had fought their way to the confines of London. Only the\r\nweight of overwhelming numbers, reinforced by engines of destruction\r\nwhich could strike without the possibility of effective retaliation,\r\nhad made their progress possible.\r\n\r\nHad they met their heroic foes as they had met them in the days of\r\nthe old warfare, their superiority of numbers would have availed them\r\nbut little. They would have been hurled back and driven into the sea,\r\nand not a man of them all would have left British soil alive had it\r\nbeen but a question of military attack and defence.\r\n\r\nBut this was not a war of men. It was a war of machines, and those\r\nwho wielded the most effective machinery for the destruction of life\r\nwon battle after battle as a matter of course, just as a man armed\r\nwith a repeating rifle would overcome a better man armed with a bow\r\nand arrow.\r\n\r\nNatas had formed an entirely accurate estimate of the policy of the\r\nleaders of the League when he told Tremayne, in the library at\r\nAlanmere, that they would concentrate all their efforts on the\r\nreduction of London. The rest of the kingdom had been for the present\r\nentirely ignored.\r\n\r\nLondon was the heart of the British Empire and of the\r\nEnglish-speaking world, for the matter of that, and therefore it had\r\nbeen determined to strike one deadly blow at the vital centre of the\r\nwhole huge organism. That paralysed, the rest must fall to pieces of\r\nnecessity. The fleet was destroyed, and every soldier that Britain\r\ncould put into the field had been mustered for the defence of London.\r\nTherefore the fall of London meant the conquest of Britain.\r\n\r\nAfter the battles of Dover and Harwich the invading forces advanced\r\nupon London in the following order: The Army of the South had landed\r\nat Deal, Dover, and Folkestone in three divisions, and after a series\r\nof terrific conflicts had fought its way _viâ_ Chatham, Maidstone,\r\nand Tunbridge to the banks of the Thames, and occupied all the\r\ncommanding positions from Shooter's Hill to Richmond. These three\r\nforces were composed entirely of French and Italian army corps, and\r\nnumbered from first to last nearly four million men.\r\n\r\nOn the north the invading force was almost wholly Russian, and was\r\nunder the command of the Tzar in person, in whom the supreme command\r\nof the armies of the League had by common consent been now vested. A\r\nconstant service of transports, plying day and night between Antwerp\r\nand Harwich, had placed at his disposal a force about equal to that\r\nof the Army of the South, although he had lost over seven hundred\r\nthousand men before he was able to occupy the line of heights from\r\nHornsey to Hampstead, with flanking positions at Brondesbury and\r\nHarlesden to the west, and at Tottenham, Stratford, and Barking to\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nBy the 29th of November all the railways were in the hands of the\r\ninvaders. A chain of war-balloons between Barking and Shooter's Hill\r\nclosed the Thames. The forts at Tilbury had been destroyed by an\r\naërial bombardment. A flotilla of submarine torpedo-vessels had blown\r\nup the defences of the estuary of the Thames and Medway, and led to\r\nthe fall of Sheerness and Chatham, and had then been docked at\r\nSheerness, there being no further present use for them.\r\n\r\nThe other half of the squadron, supported by a few battleships and\r\ncruisers which had survived the battle of Dover, had proceeded to\r\nPortsmouth, destroyed the booms and submarine defences, while a\r\ndetachment of aerostats shelled the land defences, and then in a\r\nmoment of wanton revenge had blown up the venerable hulk of the\r\n_Victory_, which had gone down at her moorings with her flag still\r\nflying as it had done a hundred years before at the fight of\r\nTrafalgar. After this inglorious achievement they had been laid up in\r\ndock to wait for their next opportunity of destruction, should it\r\never occur.\r\n\r\nLondon was thus cut off from all communication, not only with the\r\noutside world, but even from the rest of England. The remnants of the\r\narmies of defence had been gradually driven in upon the vast\r\nwilderness of bricks and mortar which now held more than eight\r\nmillions of men, women, and children, hemmed in by long lines of\r\nbatteries and entrenched camps, from which thousands of guns hurled\r\ntheir projectiles far and wide into the crowded masses of the houses,\r\nshattering them with bursting shells, and laying the whole streets in\r\nruins, while overhead the war-balloons slowly circled hither and\r\nthither, dropping their fire-shells and completing the ruin and havoc\r\nwrought by the artillery of the siege-trains.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances surrender was really only a matter of time,\r\nand that time had very nearly come. The London and North-Western\r\nRailway, which had been the last to fall into the hands of the\r\ninvaders, had been closed for over a week, and food was running very\r\nshort. Eight millions of people massed together in a space of thirty\r\nor forty square miles' area can only be fed and kept healthy under\r\nthe most favourable conditions. Hemmed in as London now was, from\r\nbeing the best ordered great city in the world, it had degenerated\r\nwith frightful rapidity into a vast abode of plague and famine, a\r\nmass of human suffering and misery beyond all conception or\r\npossibility of description.\r\n\r\nDefence there was now practically none; but still the invaders did\r\nnot leave their vantage ground on the hills, and not a soldier of the\r\nLeague had so far set foot in London proper. Either the besiegers\r\npreferred to starve the great city into surrender at discretion, and\r\nthen extort ruinous terms, or else they hesitated to plunge into that\r\ntremendous gulf of human misery, maddened by hunger and made\r\ndesperate by despair. If they did so hesitate they were wise, for\r\nLondon was too vast to be carried by assault or by any series of\r\nassaults.\r\n\r\nNo army could have lived in its wilderness of streets swarming with\r\nenemies, who would have fought them from house to house and street to\r\nstreet. Once they had entered that mighty maze of streets and squares\r\nboth their artillery and their war-balloons would have been useless,\r\nfor they would only have buried friend and foe in common destruction.\r\nThere were plenty of ways into London, but the way out was a very\r\ndifferent matter.\r\n\r\nHad a general assault been attempted, not a man would ever have got\r\nout of London alive. The commanders of the League saw this clearly,\r\nand so they kept their position on the heights, wasted the city with\r\nan almost constant bombardment, and, while they drew their supplies\r\nfrom the fertile lands in their rear, lay on their arms and waited\r\nfor the inevitable.\r\n\r\nWithin the besieged area martial law prevailed universally. Riots\r\nwere of daily, almost hourly, occurrence, but they were repressed\r\nwith an iron hand, and the rioters were shot down in the streets\r\nwithout mercy; for, though siege and famine were bad enough, anarchy\r\nbreaking out amidst that vast sweltering mass of human beings would\r\nhave been a thousand times worse, and so the King, who, assisted by\r\nthe Prime Minister and the Cabinet Council, had assumed the control\r\nof the whole city, had directed that order was to be maintained at\r\nany price.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the army were quartered in the parks under canvas, and\r\nbilleted in houses throughout the various districts, in order to\r\nsupport the police in repressing disorder and protecting property.\r\nStill, in spite of all that could be done, matters were rapidly\r\ncoming to a terrible pass. In a week, at the latest, the horses of\r\nthe cavalry would be eaten. For a fortnight London had almost lived\r\nupon horse-flesh. In the poorer quarters there was not a dog to be\r\nseen, and a sewer rat was considered a delicacy.\r\n\r\nEight million mouths had made short work of even the vast supplies\r\nthat had been hurriedly poured into the city as soon as the invasion\r\nhad become a certainty, and absolute starvation was now a matter of a\r\nfew days at the outside. There were millions of money lying idle, but\r\nvery soon a five-pound note would not buy even a little loaf of\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nBut famine was by no means the only horror that afflicted London\r\nduring those awful days and nights. All round the heights the booming\r\nof cannon sounded incessantly. Huge shells went screaming through the\r\nair overhead to fall and burst amidst some swarming hive of humanity,\r\nscattering death and mutilation where they fell; and high up in the\r\nair the fleet of aerostats perpetually circled, dropping their\r\nfire-shells and blasting cartridges on the dense masses of houses,\r\nuntil a hundred conflagrations were raging at once in different parts\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nNo help had come from outside. Indeed none was to be expected. There\r\nwas only one Power in the world that was now capable of coping with\r\nthe forces of the victorious League, but its overtures had been\r\nrejected, and neither the King nor any of his advisers had now the\r\nslightest idea as to how those who controlled it would now use it. No\r\none knew the real strength of the Terrorists, or the Federation which\r\nthey professed to control.\r\n\r\nAll that was known was that, if they choose, they could with their\r\naërial fleet sweep the war-balloons from the air in a few moments and\r\ndestroy the batteries of the besiegers; but they had made no sign\r\nafter the rejection of their President's offer to prevent the landing\r\nof the forces of the League on condition that the British Government\r\naccepted the Federation, and resigned its powers in favour of its\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of those terms had now cost more than a million British\r\nlives, and an incalculable amount of human suffering and destruction\r\nof property. Until the news of the disaster of Dover had actually\r\nreached London, no one had really believed that it was possible for\r\nan invading force to land on British soil and exist for twenty-four\r\nhours. Now the impossible had been made possible, and the last\r\ncrushing blow must fall within the next few days. After that who knew\r\nwhat might befall?\r\n\r\nSo far as could be seen, Britain lay helpless at the mercy of her\r\nfoes. Her allies had ceased to exist as independent Powers, and the\r\nRussian and the Gaul were thundering at her gates as, fifteen hundred\r\nyears before, the Goth had thundered at the gates of the Eternal City\r\nin the last days of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nIf the terms of the Federation could have been offered again, it is\r\nprobable that the King of England would have been the first man to\r\nown his mistake and that of his advisers and accept them, for now the\r\nchoice lay between utter and humiliating defeat and the breaking up\r\nof the Empire, and the recognition of the Federation. After all, the\r\nkinship of a race was a greater fact in the supreme hour of national\r\ndisaster than the maintenance of a dynasty or the perpetuation of a\r\nparticular form of government.\r\n\r\nIt was not now a question of nation against nation, but of race\r\nagainst race. The fierce flood of war had swept away all smaller\r\ndistinctions. It was necessary to rise to the altitude of the problem\r\nof the Government, not of nations, but of the world. Was the genius\r\nof the East or of the West to shape the future destinies of the human\r\nrace? That was the mighty problem of which the events of the next few\r\nweeks were to work out the solution, for when the sun set on the\r\nField of Armageddon the fate of Humanity would be fixed for centuries\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nAN ENVOY OF DELIVERANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time that the Tsar had received the conditional declaration\r\nof war from the President of the Anglo-Saxon Federation in America to\r\nnightfall on the 29th of November, when the surrender of the capital\r\nof the British Empire was considered to be a matter of a few days\r\nonly, the Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the League was\r\nabsolutely in the dark, not only as to the actual intentions of the\r\nTerrorists, if they had any, but also as to the doings of his allies\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nAccording to the stipulations arranged between himself and the\r\nconfidential agent of the American Government, the blockading\r\nflotilla of dynamite cruisers ought to have sailed from America as\r\nsoon as the cypher message containing the news of the battle of Dover\r\nreached New York. The message had been duly sent _viâ_ Queenstown and\r\nNew York, and had been acknowledged in the usual way, but no definite\r\nreply had come to it, and a month had elapsed without the appearance\r\nof the promised squadron. The explanation of this will be readily\r\nguessed. The American end of the Queenstown cable had been\r\nreconnected with Washington, but it was under the absolute control of\r\nTremayne, who permitted no one to use it save himself.\r\n\r\nOther messages had been sent to which no reply had been received, and\r\na swift French cruiser, which had been launched at Brest since the\r\nbattle of Dover, had been dispatched across the Atlantic to discover\r\nthe reason of this strange silence. She had gone, but she had never\r\nreturned. The Atlantic highway appeared to be barred by some\r\ninvisible force. No vessels came from the westward, and those which\r\nstarted from the east were never heard of again.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty had treated the summons of the President of the\r\nFederation with silent contempt, just as such a victorious autocrat\r\nmight have been expected to do. True, he knew the terrific power\r\nwielded by the Terrorists through their aërial fleet, and he had an\r\nuncomfortable conviction, which refused to be entirely stifled, that\r\nin the days to come he would have to reckon with them and it.\r\n\r\nBut that a member of the Terrorist Brotherhood could by any possible\r\nmeans have placed himself at the head of any body of men sufficiently\r\nnumerous or well-disciplined to make them a force to be seriously\r\nreckoned with in military warfare, his Majesty had never for a moment\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\nAnd, more than this, however disquieting might be the uncertainty due\r\nto the ominous silence on the other side of the Atlantic, and the\r\nnon-arrival of the expected fleet, there stood the great and\r\nsignificant fact that the army of the League had been permitted,\r\nwithout molestation either from the Terrorists or the Federation in\r\nwhose name they had presumed to declare war upon him, not only to\r\ndestroy what remained of the British fleet, but to completely invest\r\nthe very capital of Anglo-Saxondom itself.\r\n\r\nAll this had been done; the sacred soil of Britain itself had been\r\nviolated by the invading hosts; the army of defence had been slowly,\r\nand at a tremendous sacrifice of life on both sides, forced back from\r\nline after line, and position after position, into the city itself;\r\nhis batteries were raining their hail of shot and shell from the\r\nheights round London, and his aerostats were hurling ruin from the\r\nsky upon the crowded millions locked up in the beleaguered space; and\r\nyet the man who had presumed to tell him that the hour in which he\r\nset foot on British soil would be the last of his Empire, had done\r\nabsolutely nothing to interrupt the march of conquest.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that Alexander Romanoff was at least as\r\ncompletely in the dark as to the possible course of the events of the\r\nnear future as was the King of England himself, shut up in his\r\ncapital, and cut off from all communication from the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 29th of November there was held at the Prime\r\nMinister's rooms in Downing Street a Cabinet Council, presided over\r\nby the King in person. After the Council had remained for about an\r\nhour in earnest consultation, a stranger was admitted to the room in\r\nwhich they were sitting.\r\n\r\nThe reader would have recognised him in a moment as Maurice Colston,\r\notherwise Alexis Mazanoff, for he was dressed almost exactly as he\r\nhad been on that memorable night, just thirteen months before, when\r\nhe made the acquaintance of Richard Arnold on the Thames Embankment.\r\n\r\nWell-dressed, well-fed, and perfectly at ease, he entered the Council\r\nChamber without any aggressive assumption, but still with the quiet\r\nconfidence of a man who knows that he is practically master of the\r\nsituation. How he had even got into London, beleaguered as it was on\r\nevery side in such fashion that no one could get out of it without\r\nbeing seen and shot by the besiegers, was a mystery; but how he could\r\nhave in his possession, as he had, a despatch dated thirty-six hours\r\npreviously in New York was a still deeper mystery; and upon neither\r\nof these points did he make the slightest attempt to enlighten the\r\nmembers of the British Cabinet.\r\n\r\nAll that he said was that he was the bearer of a message from the\r\nPresident of the Anglo-Saxon Federation in America, and that he was\r\ninstructed to return that night to New York with such answer as the\r\nBritish Government might think fit to make to it. It was this message\r\nthat had been the subject of the deliberations of the Council before\r\nhis admission, and its net effect was as follows.\r\n\r\nIt was now practically certain, indeed proved to demonstration, that\r\nthe forces at the command of the British Government were not capable\r\nof coping with those brought against them by the commanders of the\r\nLeague, and that therefore Britain, if left to her own resources,\r\nmust inevitably succumb, and submit to such terms as her conquerors\r\nmight think fit to impose upon her. The choice before the British\r\nGovernment thus lay between surrender to her foreign enemies, whose\r\nobjects were well known to be dismemberment of the Empire and the\r\nreduction of Great Britain to the rank of a third-class Power,--to\r\nsay nothing of the payment of a war indemnity which could not fail to\r\nbe paralysing,--and the consent of those who controlled the destinies\r\nof the mother country to accept a Federation of the whole Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace, to waive the merely national idea in favour of the racial one,\r\nand to permit the Executive Council of the Federation to assume those\r\ngovernmental functions which were exercised at present by the King\r\nand the British Houses of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the choice lay between conquest by a league of foreign\r\npowers and the merging of Britain into the Federation of the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples of the world.\r\n\r\nIf the former choice were taken, the only prospect possible under the\r\ncondition of things was a possibly enormous sacrifice of human life\r\non the side of both Britain and its enemies, a gigantic loss in\r\nmoney, the crippling of British trade and commerce, and then a\r\npossible, nay probable, social revolution to which the message\r\ndistinctly pointed.\r\n\r\nIf the latter choice were taken, the forces of the Federation would\r\nbe at once brought into the field against those of the League, the\r\nsiege of London would be raised, the power of the invaders would be\r\neffectually broken for ever, and the stigma of conquest finally wiped\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt is only just to record the fact that in this supreme crisis of\r\nBritish history the man who most strongly insisted upon the\r\nacceptance of the terms which he had previously, as he now confessed\r\nin the most manly and outspoken fashion, rejected in ignorance of the\r\ntrue situation of affairs, was the man who believed that he would\r\nlose a crown by accepting them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ambassador of the Federation had been presented to the\r\nCouncil, the King rose in his place and handed to him with his own\r\nhands a sealed letter, saying as he did so--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mazanoff, I am still to a great extent in ignorance as to the\r\ninexplicable combination of events which has made it necessary for me\r\nto return this affirmative answer to the message of which you are the\r\nbearer. I am, however, fully aware that the Earl of Alanmere, whose\r\nname I have seen at the foot of this document with the most profound\r\nastonishment, is in a position to do what he says.\r\n\r\n\"The course of events has been exactly that which he predicted. I\r\nknow, too, that whatever causes may have led him to unite himself to\r\nthose known as the Terrorists, he is an English nobleman, and a man\r\nto whom falsehood or bad faith is absolutely impossible. In your\r\nmarvellous aërial fleet I know also that he wields the only power\r\ncapable of being successfully opposed to those terrible machines\r\nwhich had wrought such havoc upon the fleets and armies, not only of\r\nBritain, but of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"To a certain extent this is a surrender, but I feel that it will be\r\nbetter to surrender the destinies of Britain into the hands of her\r\nown blood and kindred than to the tender mercies of her alien\r\nenemies. My own personal feelings must weigh as nothing in the\r\nbalance where the fate, not only of this country, but perhaps of the\r\nwhole world, is now poised.\r\n\r\n\"After all, the first duty of a Constitutional King is not to himself\r\nand his dynasty, but to his country and his people, and therefore I\r\nfeel that it will be better for me and mine to be citizens of a free\r\nFederation of the English-speaking peoples, and of the nations to\r\nwhich Britain has given birth, than the titular sovereign and Royal\r\nfamily of a conquered country, holding the mockery of royalty on the\r\nsufferance of their conquerors.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Lord Alanmere from me that I now accept the terms he has\r\noffered as President of the Anglo-Saxon Federation, first, because at\r\nall hazards I would see Britain delivered from her enemies; and,\r\nsecondly, because I have chosen rather to be an English gentleman\r\nwithout a crown, than to wear a crown which after all would only be\r\ngift from my conquerors.\"\r\n\r\nEdward VII. spoke with visible emotion, but with a dignity which even\r\nMazanoff, little and all as he respected the name of king, felt\r\nhimself compelled to recognise and respect. He took the letter with a\r\nbow that was more one of reverence than of courtesy, and as he put it\r\ninto his breast-pocket of his coat he said--\r\n\r\n\"The President will receive your Majesty's reply with as genuine\r\npleasure and satisfaction as I shall give it to him. Though I am a\r\nRussian without a drop of English blood in my veins, I have always\r\nlooked upon the British race as the real bulwark of freedom, and I\r\nrejoice that the King of England has not permitted either tradition\r\nor personal feeling to stand in the way of the last triumph of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race.\r\n\r\n\"As long as the English language is spoken your Majesty's name will\r\nbe held in greater honour for this sacrifice which you make to-day,\r\nthan will that of any other English king for the greatest triumph of\r\narms ever achieved in the history of your country.\r\n\r\n\"I must now take my leave, for I must be in New York to-morrow night.\r\nI have your word that I shall not be watched or followed after I\r\nleave here. Hold the city for six days more at all costs, and on the\r\nseventh at the latest the siege shall be raised and the enemies of\r\nBritain destroyed in their own entrenchments.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the envoy of the Federation bowed once more to the King\r\nand the astonished members of his Council, and was escorted to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nOnce in the street he strode away rapidly through Parliament Street\r\nand the Strand, then up Drury Lane, until he reached the door of a\r\nmean-looking house in a squalid court, and entering this with a\r\nlatch-key, disappeared.\r\n\r\nThree hours later a Russian soldier of the line, wearing an almost\r\nimperceptible knot of red ribbon in one of the button-holes of his\r\ntunic, passed through the Russian lines on Hampstead Heath\r\nunchallenged by the sentries, and made his way northward to Northaw\r\nWood, which he reached soon after nightfall.\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour the _Ithuriel_ rose from the midst of a thick\r\nclump of trees like a grey shadow rising into the night, and darted\r\nsouthward and upward at such a speed that the keenest eyes must soon\r\nhave lost sight of her from the earth.\r\n\r\nShe passed over the beleaguered city at a height of nearly ten\r\nthousand feet, and then swept sharply round to the eastward. She\r\nstopped immediately over the lights of Sheerness, and descended to\r\nwithin a thousand feet of the dock, in which could be seen the\r\ndetachment of the French submarine vessels lying waiting to be sent\r\non their next errand of destruction.\r\n\r\nAs soon as those on board her had made out the dock clearly she\r\nascended a thousand feet and went about half a mile to the southward.\r\nFrom that position she poured a rapid hail of shells into the dock,\r\nwhich was instantly transformed into a cavity vomiting green flame\r\nand fragments of iron and human bodies. In five minutes nothing was\r\nleft of the dock or its contents but a churned-up swamp of muddy\r\nwater and shattered stonework.\r\n\r\nThen, her errand so far accomplished, the air-ship sped away to the\r\nsouth-westward, and within an hour she had destroyed in like fashion\r\nthe submarine squadron in the Government dock at Portsmouth, and was\r\nwinging her way westward to New York with the reply of the King of\r\nEngland to the President of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE EVE OF ARMAGEDDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the destruction of the two divisions of the\r\nsubmarine squadron reached the headquarters of the League on the\r\nnight of the 29th, it would have been difficult to say whether anger\r\nor consternation most prevailed among the leaders. A council of war\r\nwas hurriedly summoned to discuss an event which it was impossible to\r\nlook upon as anything less than a calamity.\r\n\r\nThe destruction which had been wrought was of itself disastrous\r\nenough, for it deprived the League of the chief means by which it had\r\ndestroyed the British fleet and kept command of the sea. But even\r\nmore terrible than the actual destruction was the unexpected\r\nsuddenness with which the blow had been delivered.\r\n\r\nFor five months, that is to say, from the recapture of the _Lucifer_\r\nat Aberdeen, the Tsar and his coadjutors had seen nothing of the\r\noperations of the Terrorists; and now, without a moment's warning,\r\nthis apparently omnipresent and yet almost invisible force had struck\r\nonce more with irresistible effect, and instantly vanished back into\r\nthe mystery out of which it had come.\r\n\r\nWho could tell when the next blow would fall, or in what shape the\r\nnext assault would be delivered? In the presence of such enemies,\r\ninvisible and unreachable, the commanders of the League, to their\r\nrage and disgust, felt themselves, on the eve of their supreme\r\nvictory, as impotent as a man armed with a sword would have felt in\r\nfront of a Gatling gun.\r\n\r\nConsternation naturally led to divided councils. The French and\r\nItalian commanders were for an immediate general assault on London at\r\nall hazards, and the enforcement of terms of surrender at the point\r\nof the sword. The Tsar, on the other hand, insisted on the pursuance\r\nof the original policy of reduction by starvation, as he rightly\r\nconsidered that, great as the attacking force was, it would be\r\npractically swamped amidst the infuriated millions of the besieged,\r\nand that, even if the assault were successful, the loss of life would\r\nbe so enormous that the conquest of the rest of Britain--which in\r\nsuch a case would almost certainly rise to a man--would be next door\r\nto impossible.\r\n\r\nHe, however, so far yielded as to agree to send a message to the King\r\nof England to arrange terms of surrender, if possible at once, in\r\norder to save further bloodshed, and then, if these terms were\r\nrejected, to prepare for a general assault on the seventh day from\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nThese terms were accepted as a compromise, and the next morning the\r\nbombardment ceased both from the land batteries and the air. At\r\ndaybreak on the 30th an envoy left the Tsar's headquarters in one of\r\nthe war-balloons, flying a flag of truce, and descended in Hyde Park.\r\nHe was received by the King in Council at Buckingham Palace, and,\r\nafter a lengthy deliberation, an answer was returned to the effect\r\nthat on condition the bombardment ceased for the time being, London\r\nwould be surrendered at noon on the 6th of December if no help had by\r\nthat time arrived from the other cities of Britain. These terms,\r\nafter considerable opposition from General le Gallifet and General\r\nCosensz, the Italian Commander-in-Chief, were adopted and ratified at\r\nnoon that day, almost at the very moment that Alexis Mazanoff was\r\npresenting the reply of the King of England to the President of the\r\nFederation in New York.\r\n\r\nAs the relief expedition had been fully decided upon, whether the\r\nBritish Government recognised the Federation or not, everything was\r\nin readiness for an immediate start as soon as the _Ithuriel_ brought\r\ndefinite news as to the acceptation or rejection of the President's\r\nsecond offer. For the last seven weeks the ten dockyards of the east\r\ncoast of America, and at Halifax in Nova Scotia, had been thronged\r\nwith shipping, and swarming with workmen and sailors.\r\n\r\nAll the vessels which had been swept off the Atlantic by the\r\nwar-storm, and which were of sufficient size and speed to take part\r\nin the expedition, had been collected at these eleven ports. Whole\r\nfleets of liners of half a dozen different nationalities, which had\r\nbeen laid up since the establishment of the blockade, were now lying\r\nalongside the quays, taking in vast quantities of wheat and\r\nmiscellaneous food-stuffs, which were being poured into their holds\r\nfrom the glutted markets of America and Canada. Every one of these\r\nvessels was fitted up as a troopship, and by the time all\r\narrangements were complete, more than a thousand vessels, carrying on\r\nan average twelve hundred men each, were ready to take the sea.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these there was a fleet of warships as yet unscathed\r\nby shot or shell, consisting of thirty battleships, a hundred and ten\r\ncruisers, and the flotilla of dynamite cruisers which had been\r\nconstructed by the late Government at the expense of the capitalist\r\nRing. There were no less than two hundred of these strange but\r\nterribly destructive craft, the lineal descendants of the _Vesuvius_,\r\nwhich, as the naval reader will remember, was commissioned in 1890.\r\n\r\nThey were double-hulled vessels built on the whale-back plan, and the\r\ncompartments between the inner and outer hull could be wholly or\r\npartially filled with water. When they were entirely filled the hull\r\nsank below the surface, leaving nothing as a mark to an enemy save a\r\nplatform standing ten feet above the water. This platform,\r\nconstructed throughout of 6-inch nickel-steel, was of oval shape, a\r\nhundred feet long and thirty broad in its greatest diameter, and\r\ncarried the heavily armoured wheel-house and conning-tower, two\r\nfunnels, six ventilators, and two huge pneumatic guns, each\r\nseventy-five feet long, working on pivots nearly amidships. These\r\nweapons, with an air-charge of three hundred atmospheres, would throw\r\nfour hundred pounds of dynamite to a distance of three miles with\r\nsuch accuracy that the projectile would invariably fall within a\r\nspace of twenty feet square. The guns could be discharged once a\r\nminute, and could thus hurl 48,000 lbs. of dynamite an hour upon a\r\nhostile fleet or fortifications.\r\n\r\nEach cruiser also carried two under-water torpedo tubes ahead and two\r\nastern. The funnels emitted no smoke, but merely supplied draught to\r\nthe petroleum furnaces, which burned with practically no waste, and\r\ndeveloped a head of steam which drove the long submerged hulls\r\nthrough the water at a rate of thirty-two knots, or more than\r\nthirty-six miles an hour.\r\n\r\nSuch was the enormous naval armament, manned by nearly a hundred\r\nthousand men, which hoisted the Federation flag at one o'clock on the\r\nafternoon of the 30th of November, when orders were telegraphed north\r\nand south from Washington to get ready for sea. Two hours later the\r\nvast flotilla of warships and transports had cleared American waters,\r\nand was converging towards a point indicated by the intersection of\r\nthe 41st parallel of latitude with the 40th meridian of longitude.\r\n\r\nAt this ocean rendezvous the divisions of the fleet and its convoys\r\nmet and shaped their course for the mouth of the English Channel.\r\nThey proceeded in column of line abreast three deep, headed by the\r\ndynamite cruisers, after which came the other warships which had\r\nformed the American Navy, and after these again came the troopships\r\nand transports properly protected by cruisers on their flanks and in\r\ntheir rear.\r\n\r\nThe commander of every warship and transport had the most minute\r\ninstructions as to how he was to act on reaching British waters, and\r\nwhat these were will become apparent in due course. The weather was\r\nfairly good for the time of year, and, as there was but little danger\r\nof collision on the now deserted waters of the Atlantic, the whole\r\nflotilla kept at full speed all the way. As, however, its speed was\r\nnecessarily limited by that of its slowest steamer until the scene of\r\naction was reached, it was after midnight on the 5th of December when\r\nits various detachments had reached their appointed stations on the\r\nEnglish coast.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the English Channel and St. George's Channel a few\r\nscouting cruisers, flying French, Russian, and Italian colours, had\r\nbeen run down and sunk by the dynamite cruisers. Strict orders had\r\nbeen given by Tremayne to destroy everything flying a hostile flag,\r\nand not to permit any news to be taken to England of the approach of\r\nthe flotilla. The Federation was waging a war, not merely of conquest\r\nand revenge, but of extermination, and no more mercy was to be shown\r\nto its enemies than they had shown in their march of victory from one\r\nend of Europe to the other.\r\n\r\nWhile the Federation fleet had been crossing the Atlantic, other\r\nevents no less important had been taking place in England and\r\nScotland. The hitherto apparently inert mass of the population had\r\nsuddenly awakened out of its lethargy. In town and country alike men\r\nforsook their daily avocations as if by one consent. As in America,\r\nartisans, pitmen, clerks, and tradesmen were suddenly transformed\r\ninto soldiers, who drilled, first in squads of ten, and then in\r\nhundreds and thousands, and finally in tens of thousands, all\r\nuniformed alike in rough grey breeches and tunics, with a knot of red\r\nribbon in the button-hole, and all armed with rifle, bayonet, and\r\nrevolver, which they seemed to handle with a strange and ominous\r\nfamiliarity.\r\n\r\nAll the railway traffic over the island was stopped, and the\r\nrolling-stock collected at the great stations along the lines to\r\nLondon, and at the same time all the telegraph wires communicating\r\nwith the south and east were cut. As day after day passed, signs of\r\nan intense but strongly suppressed excitement became more and more\r\nvisible all over the provinces, and especially in the great towns and\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nIn London very much the same thing had happened. Hundreds of\r\nthousands of civilians vanished during that seven days of anxious\r\nwaiting for the hour of deliverance, and in their place sprang up\r\norderly regiments of grey-clad soldiers, who saw the red knot in each\r\nother's button-holes, and welcomed each other as comrades unknown\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of the commanders of the regular army, orders had\r\nbeen issued by the King that all possible assistance was to be\r\nrendered to these strange legions, which had thus so suddenly sprang\r\ninto existence; and the result was that when the sun set on the 5th\r\nof December, the twenty-first day of the total blockade of London,\r\nthe beleaguered space contained over two millions of armed men,\r\nhungering both for food and vengeance, who, like the five millions of\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen outside London, were waiting for a sign from\r\nthe sky to fling themselves upon the entrapped and unsuspecting\r\ninvader.\r\n\r\nThat night countless eyes were upturned throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Britain to the dun pall of wintry cloud that overspread\r\nthe land. Yet so far, so perfect was the discipline of this gigantic\r\nhost, not a sign of overt hostile movement had been made, and the\r\ncommanders of the armies of the League looked forward with exulting\r\nconfidence to the moment, now only a few hours distant, when the\r\ncapital of the British Empire, cut off from all help, should be\r\nsurrendered into their hands in accordance with the terms agreed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell the _Ithuriel_ was floating four thousand feet above\r\nAberdeen. Arnold and Natasha, wrapped in warm furs, were standing on\r\ndeck impatiently watching the sun sinking down over the sea of clouds\r\nwhich lay between them and the earth.\r\n\r\n\"There it goes at last!\" exclaimed Natasha, as the last of the level\r\nbeams shot across the cloud-sea and the rim of the pale disc sank\r\nbelow the surface of the vapoury ocean. \"The time that we have waited\r\nand worked for so long has come at last. This is the eve of\r\nArmageddon! Who would think it, floating up here above the clouds and\r\nbeneath those cold, calmly shining stars! And yet the fate of the\r\nwhole world is trembling in the balance, and the doings of the next\r\ntwenty-four hours will settle the destiny of mankind for generations\r\nto come. The hour of the Revolution has struck at last\"--\r\n\r\n\"And therefore it is time that the Angel of the Revolution should\r\ngive the last signal with her own hand!\" said Arnold, seized with a\r\nsudden fancy, \"Come, you shall start the dynamo yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes I will, and, I hope, kindle a flame that shall purge the earth\r\nof tyranny and oppression for ever. Richard, what must my father be\r\nthinking of just now down yonder in the cabin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare not even guess. To-morrow or the next day will be the day of\r\nreckoning, and then God help those of whom he demands payment, for\r\nthey will need it. The vials of wrath are full, and before long the\r\noppressors of the earth will have drained them to the dregs. Come, it\r\nis time we went down.\"\r\n\r\nThey descended together to the engine-room, and meanwhile the\r\nair-ship sank through the clouds until the lights of Aberdeen lay\r\nabout a thousand feet below. A lens of red glass had been fitted to\r\nthe searchlight of the _Ithuriel_, and all that was necessary was to\r\nconnect the forward engine with the dynamo.\r\n\r\nArnold put Natasha's hand on a little lever. As she took hold of it\r\nshe thought with a shudder of the mighty forces of destruction which\r\nher next movement would let loose. Then she thought of all that those\r\nnearest and dearest to her had suffered at the hands of Russian\r\ndespotism, and of all the nameless horrors of the rule whose\r\ndeath-signal she was about to give.\r\n\r\nAs she did so her grip tightened on the lever, and when Arnold,\r\nhaving given his orders to the head engineer as to speed and course,\r\nput his hand on her shoulder and said, \"Now!\" she pulled it back with\r\na sharp, determined motion, and the next instant a broad fan of\r\nblood-red light shot over the _Ithuriel's_ bows.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the air-ship's propellers began to spin round, and\r\nthen with the flood of red light streaming in front of her, she\r\nheaded southward at full speed towards Edinburgh. The signal flashed\r\nover the Scottish capital, and then the _Ithuriel_ swerved round to\r\nthe westward.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Glasgow saw it, and then away she sped southward\r\nacross the Border to Carlisle; and so through the long December night\r\nshe flew hither and thither, eastward and westward, flashing the red\r\nbattle-signal over field and village and town; and wherever it shone\r\narmed men sprang up like the fruit of the fabled dragon's teeth,\r\ncompanies were mustered in streets and squares and fields and marched\r\nto railway stations; and soon long trains, one after another in\r\nendless succession, got into motion, all moving towards the south and\r\neast, all converging upon London.\r\n\r\nLast of all, after it had made a swift circuit of northern and\r\ncentral and western England, the red light swept along the south\r\ncoast, and then swerved northward again till it flashed thrice over\r\nLondon, and then it vanished into the darkness of the hour before the\r\ndawn of Armageddon.\r\n\r\nSince the ever-memorable night of Thursday the 29th of July 1588,\r\nthree hundred and sixteen years before, when \"The beacon blazed upon\r\nthe roof of Edgcumbe's lofty Hall,\" and the answering fires sprang up\r\n\"From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,\" to tell\r\nthat the Spanish Armada was in sight, there had been no such night in\r\nEngland, nor had men ever dreamed that there should be.\r\n\r\nBut great as had been the deeds done by the heroes of the sixteenth\r\ncentury with the pigmy means at their command, they were but the\r\nmerest child's play to the awful storm of devastation which, in a few\r\nhours, was to burst over southern England. Then it was England\r\nagainst Spain; now it was Anglo-Saxondom against the world; and the\r\nconquering race of earth, armed with the most terrific powers of\r\ndestruction that human wit had ever devised, was rising in its wrath,\r\nmillions strong, to wipe out the stain of invasion from the sacred\r\nsoil of the motherland of the Anglo-Saxon nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD LION AT BAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 6th of December dawned grey and cold over London\r\nand the hosts that were waiting for its surrender. Scarcely any smoke\r\nrose from the myriad chimneys of the vast city, for the coal was\r\nalmost all burnt, and what was left was selling at £12 a ton. Wood\r\nwas so scarce that people were tearing up the woodwork of their\r\nhouses to keep a little fire going.\r\n\r\nSo the steel-grey sky remained clear, for towards daybreak the clouds\r\nhad been condensed by a cold north-easter into a sharp fall of fine,\r\nicy snow, and as the sun gained power it shone chilly over the\r\nwhitened landscape, the innumerable roofs of London, and the miles of\r\ntents lining the hills to the north and south of the Thames valley.\r\n\r\nThe havoc wrought by the bombardment on the public buildings of the\r\ngreat city had been terrible. Of the Houses of Parliament only a\r\nshapeless heap of broken stones remained, the Law Courts were in\r\nruins, what had been the Albert Hall was now a roofless ring of\r\nblackened walls, Nelson's Column lay shattered across Trafalgar\r\nSquare, and the Royal Exchange, the Bank of England, and the Mansion\r\nHouse mingled their fragments in the heart of the almost deserted\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nOnly three of the great buildings of London had suffered no damage.\r\nThese were the British Museum, Westminster Abbey, and St Paul's,\r\nwhich had been spared in accordance with special orders issued by the\r\ncommanders of the League. The two former were spared for the same\r\nreason that the Germans had spared Strasburg Cathedral in\r\n1870--because their destruction would have been a loss, not to\r\nBritain alone, but to the world.\r\n\r\nThe great church of the metropolis had been left untouched chiefly\r\nbecause it had been arranged that, on the fall of London, the Tsar\r\nwas to be proclaimed Emperor of Asia under its dome, and at the same\r\ntime General le Gallifet was to assume the Dictatorship of France and\r\nabolish the Republic, which for more than ten years had been the\r\nplaything of unprincipled financiers, and the laughing-stock of\r\nEurope. As the sun rose the great golden cross, rising high out of\r\nthe wilderness of houses, shone more and more brightly under the\r\nbrightening sky, and millions of eyes looked upon it from within the\r\ncity and from without with feelings far asunder as triumph and\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the last meal had been eaten by the defenders of the\r\ncity. To supply it almost every animal left in London had been\r\nsacrificed, and the last drop of liquor was drunk, even to the last\r\nbottle of wine in the Royal cellars, which the King shared with his\r\ntwo commanders-in-chief, Lord Roberts and Lord Wolseley, in the\r\npresence of the troops on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. At nine\r\no'clock the King and Queen attended service in St. Paul's, and when\r\nthey left the Cathedral half an hour later the besiegers on the\r\nheights were astounded to hear the bells of all the steeples left\r\nstanding in London ring out in a triumphant series of peals which\r\nrippled away eastward and westward from St. Paul's and Westminster\r\nAbbey, caught up and carried on by steeple after steeple, until from\r\nHighgate to Dulwich, and from Hammersmith to Canning Town, the\r\nbeleaguered and starving city might have been celebrating some great\r\ntriumph or deliverance.\r\n\r\nThe astonished besiegers could only put the extraordinary\r\nmanifestation down to joy on the part of the citizens at the near\r\napproaching end of the siege; but before the bells of London had been\r\nringing for half an hour this fallacious idea was dispelled from\r\ntheir minds in a very stern and summary fashion.\r\n\r\nSince nightfall there had been no communication with the secret\r\nagents of the League in the various towns of England and Scotland. At\r\nten o'clock a small company of Cossacks spurred and flogged their\r\njaded horses up the northern slope of Muswell Hill, on which the Tsar\r\nhad fixed his headquarters. Nearly every man was wounded, and the\r\nhorses were in the last stages of exhaustion. Their captain was at\r\nonce admitted to the presence of the Tsar, and, flinging himself on\r\nthe ground before the enraged Autocrat, gasped out the dreadful\r\ntidings that his little company were the sole survivors of the army\r\nof occupation that had been left at Harwich, and which, twelve hours\r\nbefore, had been thirty thousand strong.\r\n\r\nA huge fleet of strange-looking vessels, flying a plain blood-red\r\nflag, had just before four A.M. forced the approaches to the harbour,\r\nsunk every transport and warship with guns that were fired without\r\nflame, or smoke, or report, and whose projectiles shattered\r\neverything that they struck. Immediately afterwards an immense\r\nflotilla of transports had steamed in, and, under the protection of\r\nthose terrible guns, had landed a hundred thousand men, all dressed\r\nin the same plain grey uniform, with no facings or ornaments save a\r\nknot of red ribbon at the button-hole, and armed with magazine rifle\r\nand a bayonet and a brace of revolvers. All were English by their\r\nspeech, and every man appeared to know exactly what to do with very\r\nfew orders from his officers.\r\n\r\nThis invading force had hunted the Russians out of Harwich like\r\nrabbits out of a warren, while the ships in the harbour had hurled\r\ntheir shells up into the air so that they fell back to earth on the\r\nretreating army and exploded with frightful effect. The general in\r\ncommand had at once telegraphed to London for a detachment of\r\nwar-balloons and reinforcements, but no response had been received.\r\n\r\nAfter four hours' fighting the Russian army was in full retreat,\r\nwhile the attacking force was constantly increasing as transport\r\nafter transport steamed into the harbour and landed her men. At\r\nColchester the Russians had been met by another vast army which had\r\napparently sprung from the earth, dressed and armed exactly as the\r\ninvading force was. What its numbers were there was no possibility of\r\ntelling.\r\n\r\nBy this time, too, treachery began to show itself in the Russian\r\nranks, and whole companies suddenly appeared with the red knot of\r\nribbon in their tunics, and instantly turned their weapons against\r\ntheir comrades, shooting them down without warning or mercy. No\r\nquarter had been given to those who did not show the ribbon. Most of\r\nthem died fighting, but those who had thrown away their arms were\r\nshot down all the same.\r\n\r\nWhoever commanded this strange army had manifestly given orders to\r\ntake no prisoners, and it was equally certain that its movements were\r\ndirected by the Terrorists, for everywhere the battle-cries had been,\r\n\"In the Master's name!\" and \"Slay, and spare not!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of the army, save the deserters, had been destroyed, and\r\nthe deserters had immediately assumed the grey uniforms of those of\r\nthe Terrorist army who had fallen. The Cossack captain and his forty\r\nor fifty followers were the sole remains of a body of three thousand\r\nmen who had fought their way through the second army. The whole\r\ncountry to the north and east seemed alive with the grey soldiery,\r\nand it was only after a hundred hair-breadth escapes that they had\r\nmanaged to reach the protection of the lines round London.\r\n\r\nSuch was the tale of the bringer of bad tidings to the Tsar at the\r\nmoment when he was looking forward to the crowning triumph of his\r\nreign. Like the good soldier that he was, he wasted no time in\r\nthinking at a moment when everything depended on instant action.\r\n\r\nHe at once despatched a war-balloon to the French and Italian\r\nheadquarters with a note containing the terrible news from Harwich,\r\nand requesting Generals le Gallifet and Cosensz to lose no time in\r\ncommunicating with the eastern and southern ports, and in throwing\r\nout corps of observation supported by war-balloons. Evidently the\r\nAmerican Government had played the League false at the last moment,\r\nand had allied herself with Britain.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had sent off this message, the Tsar ordered a fleet of\r\nforty aerostats to proceed to the north-eastward, in advance of a\r\nforce of infantry and cavalry numbering three hundred thousand men,\r\nand supported by fifty batteries of field and machine guns, which he\r\ndetached to stop the progress of the Federation army towards London.\r\nBefore this force was in motion a reply came back from General le\r\nGallifet to the effect that all communication with the south and east\r\nwas stopped, and that an aerostat, which had been on scout duty\r\nduring the night, had returned with the news that the whole country\r\nappeared to be up in arms from Portsmouth to Dover. Corps of\r\nobservation and a fleet of thirty aerostats had been sent out, and\r\nthree army corps were already on the march to the south and east.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the hour for the surrender of London was drawing very\r\nnear, and all the while the bells were sending their mingled melody\r\nof peals and carillons up into the clear frosty air with a defiant\r\njoyousness that seemed to speak of anything but surrender. As twelve\r\no'clock approached the guns of all the batteries on the heights were\r\nloaded and trained on different parts of the city, and the whole of\r\nthe forces left after the detachment of the armies that had been sent\r\nto engage the battalions of the Federation prepared to descend upon\r\nthe devoted city from all sides after the two hours' incessant\r\nbombardment that had been ordered to precede the general attack.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that if the city surrendered a white flag was to\r\nbe hoisted on the cross of St. Paul's.\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes of twelve the Tsar ascended to the roof of the\r\nAlexandra Palace on Muswell Hill, and turned his field-glasses on the\r\ntowering dome. His face and lips were bloodless with repressed but\r\nintense anxiety, but the hands that held his glasses to his eyes were\r\nas steady as though he had been watching a review of his own troops.\r\nIt was the supreme moment of his victorious career. He was\r\npractically master of Europe. Only Britain held out. The relieving\r\nforces would be rent to fragments by his war-balloons, and then\r\ndecimated by his troops as the legions of Germany and Austria had\r\nbeen. The capital of the English-speaking world lay starving at his\r\nfeet, and a few minutes would see--\r\n\r\nHa! there goes the flag at last. A little ball of white bunting\r\ncreeps up from the gallery above the dark dome. It clears the railing\r\nunder the pedestal, and climbs to the apex of the shining cross. As\r\nit does so the wild chorus of the bells suddenly ceases, and out of\r\nthe silence that follows come the deep booming strokes of the great\r\nbell of St. Paul's sounding the hour of twelve.\r\n\r\nAs the last stroke dies away the ball bursts, and the White Ensign of\r\nBritain crossed by the Red Cross of St. George, and with the Jack in\r\nthe corner, floats out defiantly on the breeze, greeted by the\r\nreawakening clamour of the bells, and a deep hoarse cry from millions\r\nof throats, that rolls like a vast sea of sound up the slopes to the\r\nencampments of the League.\r\n\r\nWith an irrepressible cry of rage, Alexander dashed his field-glass\r\nto the ground, and shouted, in a voice broken with passion--\r\n\r\n\"So! They have tricked us. Let the bombardment begin at once, and\r\nbring that flag down with the first shots!\"\r\n\r\nBut before the words were out of his mouth, the bombardment had\r\nalready commenced in a very different fashion to that in which he had\r\nintended that it should begin. So intense had been the interest with\r\nwhich all eyes had been turned on the Cross of St. Paul's that no one\r\nhad noticed twelve little points of shining light hanging high in air\r\nover the batteries of the besiegers, six to the north and six to the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nBut the moment that the Ensign of St. George floated from the summit\r\nof St. Paul's a rapid series of explosions roared out like a\r\nsuccession of thunder-claps along the lines of the batteries. The\r\nhills of Surrey, and Kent, and Middlesex were suddenly transformed\r\ninto volcanoes spouting flame and thick black smoke, and flinging\r\nclouds of dust and fragments of darker objects high into the air.\r\n\r\nThe order of the Tsar was obeyed in part only, for by the time that\r\nthe word to recommence the bombardment had been flashed round the\r\ncircuit of the entrenchments, more than half the batteries had been\r\nput out of action. The twelve air-ships stationed at equal intervals\r\nround the vast ellipse, and discharging their No. 3 shell from their\r\nfour guns ahead and astern, from an elevation of four thousand feet,\r\nhad simultaneously wrecked half the batteries of the besiegers before\r\ntheir occupants had any clear idea of what was really happening.\r\n\r\nWherever one of those shells fell and exploded, earth and stone and\r\niron melted into dust under the terrific force of the exploding\r\ngases, and the air-ships, moving with a velocity compared with which\r\nthe utmost speed of the aerostats was as a snail's pace, flitted\r\nhither and thither wherever a battery got into action, and destroyed\r\nit before the second round had been fired.\r\n\r\nThere were still twenty-five aerostats at the command of the Tsar\r\nwhich had not been sent against the relieving forces, and as soon as\r\nit was realised that the aërial bombardment of the batteries came\r\nfrom the air-ships of the Terrorist fleet, they were sent into the\r\nair to engage them at all hazards. They outnumbered them two to one,\r\nbut there was no comparison between the manoeuvring powers of the two\r\naërial squadrons.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the aerostats rose into the air, the Terrorist fleet\r\nreceded northward and southward from the batteries. Their guns had a\r\nsix-mile range, and it did not matter to them which side of the\r\nassailed area they lay. They could still hurl their explosives with\r\nthe same deadly precision on the appointed mark. But with the\r\naerostats it was a very different matter. They could only drop their\r\nshells vertically, and where they were not exactly above the object\r\nof attack their shells exploded with comparative harmlessness.\r\n\r\nAs a natural consequence they had to follow the air-ships, not only\r\naway from London, but over their own encampments, in order to bring\r\nthem to anything like close quarters. The aerostats possessed one\r\nadvantage, and one only, over the air-ships. They were able to rise\r\nto a much greater height. But this advantage the air-ships very soon\r\nturned into a disadvantage by reason of their immensely superior\r\nspeed and ease of handling. They darted about at such a speed over\r\nthe heads of the massed forces of the League on either side of\r\nLondon, that it was impossible to drop shells upon them without\r\nrunning the inevitable risk of missing the small and swiftly-moving\r\nair-ship, and so causing the shell to burst amidst friends instead of\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nThus the Terrorist fleet, sweeping hither and thither, in wide and\r\never changing curves, lured the most dangerous assailants of the\r\nbeleaguered city farther and farther away from the real scene of\r\naction, at the very time when they were most urgently needed to\r\nsupport the attacking forces which at that moment were being poured\r\ninto London.\r\n\r\nTo destroy the air-ships seemed an impossibility, since they could\r\nmove at five times the speed of the swiftest aerostat, and yet to\r\nreturn to the bombardment of the city was to leave them free to\r\ncommit what havoc they pleased upon the encampments of the armies of\r\nthe League. So they were drawn farther and farther away from the\r\nbeleaguered city, while their agile enemies, still keeping within\r\ntheir six-mile range, evaded their shells, and yet kept up a constant\r\ndischarge of their own projectiles upon the salient points of the\r\nattack on London.\r\n\r\nBy four o'clock in the afternoon all the batteries of the besiegers\r\nhad been put out of action by the aërial bombardment. It was now a\r\nmatter of man to man and steel to steel, and so the gage of final\r\nbattle was accepted, and as dusk began to fall over the beleaguered\r\ncity, the Russian, French and Italian hosts left their lines, and\r\ndescended from their vantage ground to the assault on London, where\r\nthe old Lion at bay was waiting for them with claws bared and teeth\r\ngrinning defiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE TURN OF THE BATTLE-TIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe force which the Tsar had detached to operate against the\r\nFederation Army of the North left the headquarters at eleven o'clock,\r\nand proceeded in four main divisions by Edmonton, Chingford,\r\nChigwell, and Romford. The aerostats, regulating their speed so as to\r\nkeep touch with the land force, maintained a position two miles ahead\r\nof it at three thousand feet elevation.\r\n\r\nStrict orders had been given to press on at the utmost speed, and to\r\nuse every means to discover the Federationists, and bring them to an\r\nengagement with as little delay as possible; but they marched on hour\r\nafter hour into the dusk of the early winter evening, with the sounds\r\nof battle growing fainter in their rear, without meeting with a sign\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nAs it would have been the height of imprudence to have advanced in\r\nthe dark into a hostile country occupied by an enemy of great but\r\nunknown strength, General Pralitzin, the Commander of the Russian\r\nforce, decided to bring his men to a halt at nightfall, and therefore\r\ntook up a series of positions between Cheshunt, Epping, Chipping\r\nOngar, and Ingatestone. From these points squadrons of Cossacks\r\nscoured the country in all directions, north, east, and west, in\r\nsearch of the so far invisible army; and at the same time he sent\r\nmounted messengers back to headquarters to report that no enemy had\r\nbeen found, and to ask for further orders.\r\n\r\nThe aerostats slowed down their engines until their propellers just\r\ncounteracted the force of the wind and they hung motionless at a\r\nheight of a thousand feet, ranged in a semicircle about fifteen miles\r\nlong over the heads of the columns.\r\n\r\nAll this time the motions of the Russian army had been watched by the\r\ncaptain of the _Ithuriel_ from an elevation of eight thousand feet,\r\nfive miles to the rear. As soon as he saw them making preparations\r\nfor a halt, and had noticed the disposition of the aerostats, he left\r\nthe conning-tower which he had occupied nearly all day, and went into\r\nthe after saloon, where he found Natas and Natasha examining a large\r\nplan of London and its environs.\r\n\r\n\"They have come to a halt at last,\" he said. \"And if they only remain\r\nwhere they are for three hours longer, we have the whole army like\r\nrats in a trap, war-balloons and all. They have not seen us so far,\r\nfor if they had they would certainly have sent an aerostat aloft to\r\nreconnoitre, and, of course, I must have destroyed it. The whole\r\nforty are arranged in a semicircle over the heads of the four main\r\ncolumns in divisions of ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you propose to do with them now you have got them?\" said\r\nNatasha, looking up with a welcoming smile.\r\n\r\n\"Give me a cup of coffee first, for I am cold to the marrow, and then\r\nI'll tell you,\" replied Arnold, seating himself at the table, on\r\nwhich stood a coffee-urn with a spirit lamp beneath it, something\r\nafter the style of a Russian samovar.\r\n\r\nNatasha filled a cup and passed it to him, and he went on--\r\n\r\n\"You remember what I said to Tremayne in the Princess's sitting-room\r\nat Petersburg about the eagle and the crows just before the trial of\r\nthe Tsar's first war-balloon. Well, if you like to spend a couple of\r\nhours with me in the conning-tower as soon as it is dark enough for\r\nus to descend, I will show you what I meant then. I suppose the\r\noriginal general orders stand good?\" he said, turning to Natas.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the Master gravely. \"They must all be destroyed. This\r\nis the day of vengeance and not of mercy. If my orders have been\r\nobeyed, all the men belonging to the International in this force will\r\nhave managed to get to the rear by nightfall. They can be left to\r\ntake care of themselves. Mazanoff assured me that all the members in\r\nthe armies of the League fully understood what they are to do. Some\r\nof the war-balloons have been taken possession of by our men, but we\r\ndon't know how many. As soon as you destroy the first of the fleet,\r\nthese will rise and commence operations on the army, and they will\r\nalso fly the red flag, so there will be no fear of your mistaking\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Arnold, who had been quietly sipping his coffee\r\nwhile he listened to the utterance of this death sentence on more\r\nthan a quarter of a million of men. \"If our fellows to the northward\r\nonly obey orders promptly, there will not be many of the Russians\r\nleft by sunrise. Now, Natasha, you had better put on your furs and\r\ncome to the conning-tower; it's about time to begin.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not take her many moments to wrap up, and within five minutes\r\nshe and Arnold were standing in the conning-tower watching the camp\r\nfires of the Russian host coming nearer and nearer as the _Ithuriel_\r\nsank down through the rapidly increasing darkness towards the long\r\ndotted line which marked the position of the aerostats, whose great\r\ngas-holders stood out black and distinct against the whitened earth\r\nbeneath them.\r\n\r\nBy means of electric signals to the engineers the captain of the\r\n_Ithuriel_ was able to regulate both the speed and the elevation of\r\nthe air-ship as readily as though he had himself been in charge of\r\nthe engine-room. Giving Natasha a pair of night-glasses, and telling\r\nher to keep a bright look-out ahead, he brought the _Ithuriel_ round\r\nby the westward to a position about five miles west of the extremity\r\nof the line of war-balloons, and as soon as he got on a level with it\r\nhe advanced comparatively slowly, until Natasha was able to make it\r\nout distinctly with the night-glass.\r\n\r\nThen he signalled to the wheel-house aft to disconnect the\r\nafter-wheel, and at the same moment he took hold of the spokes of the\r\nforward-wheel in the conning-tower. The next signal was \"Full speed\r\nahead,\" and as the _Ithuriel_ gathered way and rushed forward on her\r\nerrand of destruction he said hurriedly to Natasha--\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't speak till it's over. I want all my wits for this work,\r\nand you'll want all your eyes.\"\r\n\r\nWithout speaking, Natasha glanced up at his face, and saw on it\r\nsomewhat of the same expression that she had seen at the moment when\r\nhe put the _Ariel_ at the rock-wall which barred the entrance to\r\nAeria. His face was pale, and his lips were set, and his eyes looked\r\nstraight out from under his frowning brows with an angry gleam in\r\nthem that boded ill for the fate of those against whom he was about\r\nto use the irresistible engine of destruction under his command.\r\n\r\nTwenty feet in front of them stretched out the long keen ram of the\r\nair-ship, edged and pointed like a knife. This was the sole weapon\r\nthat he intended to use. It was impossible to train the guns at the\r\ntremendous speed at which the _Ithuriel_ was travelling, but under\r\nthe circumstance the ram was the deadliest weapon that could have\r\nbeen employed.\r\n\r\nIn four minutes from the time the _Ithuriel_ started on her eastward\r\ncourse the nearest war-balloon was only fifty yards away. The\r\nair-ship, travelling at a speed of nearly two hundred miles an hour,\r\nleapt out of the dusk like a flash of white light. In ten seconds\r\nmore her ram had passed completely through the gas-holder without so\r\nmuch as a shock being felt. The next one was only five hundred yards\r\naway. Obedient to her rudder the _Ithuriel_ swerved, ripped her\r\ngas-holder from end to end, and then darted upon the next one even\r\nbefore a terrific explosion in their rear told that the car of the\r\nfirst one had struck the earth.\r\n\r\nSo she sped along the whole line, darting hither and thither in\r\nobedience to the guiding hand that controlled her, with such\r\ninconceivable rapidity that before any of the unwieldy machines,\r\nsaving only those whose occupants had been prepared for the assault,\r\nhad time to get out of the way of the destroying ram, she had rent\r\nher way through the gas-holders of twenty-eight out of the forty\r\nballoons, and flung them to the earth to explode and spread\r\nconsternation and destruction all along the van of the army encamped\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end the attack had not lasted ten minutes. When the\r\nlast of the aerostats had gone down under his terrible ram, Arnold\r\nsignalled \"Stop, and ascend,\" to the engine-room. A second signal\r\nturned on the searchlight in the bow, and from this a rapid series of\r\nflashes were sent up to the sky to the northward and eastward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Her ram had passed completely through the gasholder.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 334._]\r\n\r\nThe effect was as fearful as it was instantaneous. The twelve\r\nwar-balloons which had escaped by flying the red flag took up their\r\npositions above the Russian lines, and began to drop their fire-shell\r\nand cyanogen bombs upon the masses of men below. The air-ship,\r\nswerving round again to the westward, with her fan-wheels aloft,\r\nmoved slowly across the wide area over which men and horses were\r\nwildly rushing hither and thither in vain attempts to escape the rain\r\nof death that was falling upon them from the sky.\r\n\r\nHer searchlight, turned downwards to the earth, sought out the spots\r\nwhere they were crowded most thickly together, and then the\r\nair-ship's guns came into play also. Arnold had given orders to use\r\nthe new fire-shell exclusively, and its effects proved to be\r\nfrightful beyond description. Wherever one fell a blaze of intense\r\nlight shone for an instant upon the earth. Then this burst into a\r\nthousand fragments, which leapt into the air and spread themselves\r\nfar and wide in all directions, burning with inextinguishable fury\r\nfor several minutes, and driving men and horses mad with agony and\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nNo human fortitude or discipline could withstand the fearful rain of\r\nfire, in comparison with which even the deadly hail from the\r\naerostats seemed insignificant. For half an hour the eight guns of\r\nthe _Ithuriel_ hurled these awful projectiles in all directions,\r\nscattering death and hopeless confusion wherever they alighted, until\r\nthe whole field of carnage seemed ablaze with them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time three rockets soared up from her deck into\r\nthe dark sky, and burst into myriads of brilliant white stars, which\r\nfor a few moments shed an unearthly light upon the scene of\r\nindescribable confusion and destruction below. But they made more\r\nthan this visible, for by their momentary light could be seen\r\nseemingly interminable lines of grey-clad figures swiftly closing in\r\nfrom all sides, chasing the Cossack scouts before them in upon the\r\ncompletely disorganised Russian host.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later a continuous roll of musketry burst out on front,\r\nand flank, and rear, and a ceaseless hail of rifle bullets began to\r\nplough its way through the helpless masses of the soldiers of the\r\nTsar. They formed as well as they could to confront these new\r\nenemies, but the moment that the searchlight of the air-ship,\r\nconstantly sweeping the field, fell upon a company in anything like\r\norder, a shell descended in the midst of it and broke it up again.\r\n\r\nAll night long the work of death and vengeance went on; the grey\r\nlines ever closing in nearer and nearer upon the dwindling remnants\r\nof the Russian army. Hour after hour the hail of bullets never\r\nslackened. There was no random firing on the part of the Federation\r\nsoldiers. Every man had been trained to use his rifle rapidly but\r\ndeliberately, and never to fire until he had found his mark; and the\r\nconsequence was that the long nickel-tipped bullets, fired\r\npoint-blank into the dense masses of men, rent their way through half\r\na dozen bodies before they were spent.\r\n\r\nAt last the grey light began to break over an indescribably hideous\r\nscene of slaughter. Scarcely ten thousand men remained of the three\r\nhundred thousand who had started the day before in obedience to the\r\norder of the Tsar; and these were split up into formless squads and\r\nragged companies fighting desperately amidst heaps of corpses for\r\ndear life, without any pretence at order or formation.\r\n\r\nThe cannonade from the air had ceased, and the last scene in the\r\ndrama of death had come. With bayonets fixed and rifles lowered to\r\nthe charge, the long grey lines closed up, and, as the bugles rang\r\nout the long-awaited order, they swept forward at the double, horses\r\nand men went down like a field of standing corn under the\r\nirresistible rush of a million bayonets, and in twenty minutes all\r\nwas over. Not a man of the whole Russian army was left alive, save\r\nthose whose knot of red ribbon at the button-hole proclaimed them\r\nmembers of the International.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was light enough for Arnold to see clearly that the\r\nfate of the Russians was finally decided, he descended to the earth,\r\nand, after complimenting the commander and officers of the Federation\r\ntroops on the splendid effectiveness of their force, and their\r\nadmirable discipline and coolness, he gave orders for a two hours'\r\nrest and then a march on the Russian headquarters at Muswell Hill\r\nwith every available man. The Tsar and his Staff were to be taken\r\nalive at all hazards; every other Russian who did not wear the\r\nInternational ribbon was to be shot down without mercy.\r\n\r\nThese orders given, the _Ithuriel_ mounted into the air again, and\r\ndisappeared in the direction of London. She passed over the now\r\nshattered and silent entrenchments of the Russians at a speed which\r\nmade it possible to remain on deck without discomfort or danger, and\r\nat an elevation of two thousand feet. Natas was below in the saloon,\r\nalone with his own thoughts, the thoughts of twenty years of waiting\r\nand working and gradual approach to the hour of vengeance which was\r\nnow so near. Andrew Smith was steering in the wheel-house, Lieutenant\r\nMarston was taking his watch below, after being on deck nearly the\r\nwhole of the previous night, and Arnold and Natasha, wrapped in their\r\nwarm furs, were pacing up and down the deck engaged in conversation\r\nwhich had not altogether to do with war.\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen before the _Ithuriel_ passed over London, and\r\nthrough the clear, cold air they could see with their field-glasses\r\nsigns of carnage and destruction which made Natasha's soul sicken\r\nwithin her to gaze upon them, and even shook Arnold's now hardened\r\nnerves. All the main thoroughfares leading into London from the north\r\nand south were choked with heaps of dead bodies in Russian, French,\r\nand Italian uniforms, in the midst of which those who still survived\r\nwere being forced forward by the pressure of those behind. Every\r\nhouse that remained standing was spouting flames upon them from its\r\nwindows; and where the streets opened into squares and wider streets\r\nthere were barricades manned with British and Federation troops, and\r\nfrom their summits and loopholes the quick-firing guns were raining\r\nan incessant hail of shot and shell upon the struggling masses pent\r\nup in the streets.\r\n\r\nA horrible chorus of the rattle of small arms, the harsh, grinding\r\nroar of the machine guns, the hurrahs of the defenders, and the cries\r\nof rage and agony from the baffled and decimated assailants, rose\r\nunceasingly to their ears as they passed over the last battlefield of\r\nthe Western nations, where the Anglo-Saxon, the Russ, and the Gaul\r\nwere locked in the death struggle.\r\n\r\n\"There is some awful work going on down there,\" said Arnold, as they\r\nheaded away towards the south, where, from behind the Surrey hills,\r\nsoon came the sound of some tremendous conflict. \"For the present we\r\nmust leave them to fight it out. They don't seem to have had such\r\neasy work of it to the south as we have had to the north; but I\r\ndidn't expect they would, for they have probably detached a very much\r\nlarger force of French and Italians to attack the Army of the South\r\nthan the Russian lot we had to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is all this frightful slaughter really necessary?\" asked Natasha,\r\nslipping her arm through his, and looking up at him with eyes which\r\nfor the first time were moistened by the tears of pity for her\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\"Necessary or not,\" replied Arnold, \"it is the Master's orders, and I\r\nhave only to obey them. This is the day of vengeance for which he has\r\nwaited so long, and you can hardly expect him to show much mercy. It\r\nlies between him and Tremayne. For my part I will stay my hand only\r\nwhen I am ordered to do so.\r\n\r\n\"Still, if any one can influence Natas to mercy, you can. Nothing can\r\nnow stop the slaughter on the north, I'm afraid, for the Russians are\r\ncaught in a hopeless trap. The Londoners are enraged beyond control,\r\nand if the men spared them I believe the women would tear them to\r\npieces. But there are two or three millions of lives or so to be\r\nsaved at the south, and perhaps there is still time to do it. It\r\nwould be a task worthy of the Angel of the Revolution; why should you\r\nnot try it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so,\" said Natasha, and without another word she turned\r\naway and walked quickly towards the entrance to the saloon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nARMAGEDDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the southern side of London the struggle between the\r\nFranco-Italian armies and the troops of the Federation had been\r\nraging all night with unabated fury along a curved line extending\r\nfrom Bexley to Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe railways communicating with the ports of the south and east had,\r\nfor their own purposes, been left intact by the commanders of the\r\nLeague; and so sudden and utterly unexpected had been the invasion of\r\nthe force from America, and the simultaneous uprising of the British\r\nSection of the Brotherhood, that they had fallen into the hands of\r\nthe Federationists almost without a struggle. This had enabled the\r\ninvaders and their allies to concentrate themselves rapidly along the\r\nline of action which had been carefully predetermined upon.\r\n\r\nLanding almost simultaneously at Southampton, Portsmouth, Shoreham,\r\nNewhaven, Hastings, Folkestone, Dover, Deal, Ramsgate, and Margate,\r\nthey had been joined everywhere by their comrades of the British\r\nSection, whose first action, on receiving the signal from the sky,\r\nhad been to seize the railways and shoot down, without warning or\r\nmercy, every soldier of the League who opposed them.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened at Harwich had at the same time and in the same\r\nfashion happened at Dover and Chatham. The troops in occupation had\r\nbeen caught and crushed at a blow between overwhelming forces in\r\nfront and rear. Added to this, the International was immensely\r\nstronger in France and Italy than in Russia, and therefore the\r\ndefections from the ranks of the League had been far greater than\r\nthey had been in the north.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands had donned the red ribbon as the Signal flashed\r\nover their encampments, and when the moment came to repel the assault\r\nof the mysterious grey legions that had sprung from no one knew\r\nwhere, the bewildered French and Italian officers found their\r\nregiments automatically splitting up into squads of tens and\r\ncompanies of hundreds, obeying other orders, and joining in the\r\nslaughter of their former comrades with the most perfect _sang\r\nfroid_. By daybreak on the 6th the various divisions of the\r\nFederationists were well on their way to the French and Italian\r\npositions to the south of London. The utmost precautions had been\r\ntaken to prevent any news reaching headquarters, and these, as has\r\nbeen seen, were almost entirely successful.\r\n\r\nThe three army corps sent southward by General le Gallifet met with a\r\nruinous disaster long before they came face to face with the enemy.\r\nTen of the fleet of thirty war-balloons which had been sent to\r\nco-operate with them, had been manned and commanded by men of the\r\nInternational. They were of the newest type and the swiftest in the\r\nfleet, and their crews were armed with the strangest weapons that had\r\nyet been used in the war. These were bows and arrows, a curious\r\nanachronism amidst the elaborate machinery of destruction evolved by\r\nthe science of the twentieth century, but none the less effective on\r\nthat account. The arrows, instead of being headed in the usual way,\r\ncarried on the end of the shaft two little glass tubes full of\r\nliquid, bound together, and tipped with fulminate.\r\n\r\nWhen the fleet had been in the air about an hour these ten aerostats\r\nhad so distributed themselves that each of them, with a little\r\nmanoeuvring, could get within bowshot of two others. They also rose a\r\nlittle higher than the rest. The flutter of a white handkerchief was\r\nthe signal agreed upon, and when this was given by the man in command\r\nof the ten, each of them suddenly put on speed, and ran up close to\r\nher nearest neighbour. A flight of arrows was discharged at the\r\ngas-holder, and then she headed away for the next nearest, and\r\ndischarged a flight at her.\r\n\r\nConsidering the apparent insignificance of the means employed, the\r\neffects were absolutely miraculous. The explosion of the fulminate on\r\nstriking either the hard cordage of the net or one of the steel ribs\r\nused to give the gas-holder rigidity, broke the two tubes full of\r\nliquid. Then came another far more violent explosion, which tore\r\ngreat rents in the envelope. The imprisoned gas rushed out in\r\ntorrents, and the crippled balloons began to sink, at first slowly,\r\nand then more and more rapidly, till the cars, weighted with crews,\r\nmachinery, and explosives, struck the earth with a crash, and\r\nexploded, like so many huge shells, amidst the dense columns of the\r\nadvancing army corps. In fifteen minutes each of the ten captured\r\naerostats had sent two others to the earth, and then, completely\r\nmasters of the position, those in charge of them began their assault\r\non the helpless masses below them. This was kept up until the\r\nFederation troops appeared. Then they retired to the rear of the\r\nFrench and Italian columns, and devoted themselves to burning their\r\nstores and blowing up their ammunition trains with fire-shell.\r\n\r\nAssailed thus in front and rear, and demoralised by the defection of\r\nthe thousands who, as soon as the battle became general, showed the\r\nred ribbon and echoed the fierce battle-cry of the Federation, the\r\nsplendid force sent out by General le Gallifet was practically\r\nannihilated by midnight, and by daybreak the Federationists, after\r\nfifteen hours of almost continuous fighting, had stormed all the\r\nouter positions held by the French and Italians to the south of\r\nLondon, the batteries of which had already been destroyed by the\r\nair-ships.\r\n\r\nThus, when the _Ithuriel_ passed over London on the morning of the\r\n7th the position of affairs was as follows: The two armies which had\r\nbeen detached by the Tsar and General le Gallifet to stop the advance\r\nof the Federationists had been destroyed almost to a man. Of the two\r\nfleets of war-balloons there remained twenty-two aerostats in the\r\nhands of the Terrorists, while the twenty-five sent by the Tsar\r\nagainst the air-ships had retired at nightfall to the depot at\r\nMuswell Hill to replenish their stock of fuel and explosives. Their\r\nammunition-tenders, slow and unwieldy machines, adapted only for\r\ncarrying large cargoes of shells, had been rammed and destroyed with\r\nease by the air-ships during the running, or rather flying, fight of\r\nthe previous afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt sunset on the 6th the whole available forces of the League which\r\ncould be spared from the defence of the positions, numbering more\r\nthan three million men, had descended to the assault on London at\r\nnearly fifty different points.\r\n\r\nNo human words could convey any adequate conception of that night of\r\ncarnage and terror. The assailants were allowed to advance far into\r\nthe mighty maze of streets and byways with so little resistance, that\r\nthey began to think that the great city would fall an easy prey to\r\nthem after all. But as they approached the main arteries of central\r\nLondon they came suddenly upon barricades so skilfully disposed that\r\nit was impossible to advance without storming them, and from which,\r\nas they approached them, burst out tempests of rifle and machine\r\ngunfire, under which the heads of their columns melted away faster\r\nthan they advanced.\r\n\r\nLight, quick-firing guns, posted on the roofs of lofty buildings,\r\nrained death and mutilation upon them. The air-ships, flying hither\r\nand thither a few hundred feet above the house-tops, like spirits of\r\ndestruction, sent their shells into their crowded masses and wrought\r\nthe most awful havoc of all with their frightful explosives, blowing\r\nhundreds of men to indistinguishable fragments at every shot, while\r\nfrom the windows of every house that was not in ruins came a\r\nceaseless hail of missiles from every kind of firearm, from a\r\nmagazine rifle to a shot-gun.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came the Great Eastern Railway and the Thames had been\r\ncleared and opened, and the hearts of the starving citizens were\r\ngladdened by the welcome spectacle of train after train pouring in\r\nladen with provisions from Harwich, and of a fleet of steamers,\r\nflying the Federation flag, which filled the Thames below London\r\nBridge, and was rapidly discharging its cargoes of food at the\r\nwharves and into lighters.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the food could be unloaded it was distributed first to the\r\ntroops manning the barricades, and then to the markets and shops,\r\nwhence it was supplied free in the poorer districts, and at the usual\r\nprices in the richer ones. All that day London feasted and made\r\nmerry, for now the Thames was open there seemed to be no end to the\r\nfood that was being poured into the city which twelve hours before\r\nhad eaten its last scanty provisions. As soon as one vessel was\r\ndischarged another took its place, and opened its hold filled with\r\nthe necessaries and some of the luxuries of life.\r\n\r\nThe frightful butcheries at the barricades had stopped for the time\r\nbeing from sheer exhaustion on both sides. One cannot fight without\r\nfood, and the defenders were half-starved when they began. Rage and\r\nthe longing for revenge had lent them strength for the moment, but\r\ntwelve hours of incessant street fighting, the most wearing of all\r\nforms of battle, had exhausted them, and they were heartily glad of\r\nthe tacit truce which gave them time to eat and drink.\r\n\r\nAs for the assailants, as soon as they saw conclusive proof that the\r\nblockade had been broken and the city victualled, they found\r\nthemselves deserted by the ally on whose aid they had most counted.\r\nWhile the grip of famine remained on London they knew that its fall\r\nwas only a matter of time; but now--if food could get in so could\r\nreinforcements, and they had not the remotest idea as to the number\r\nof the mysterious forces which had so suddenly sprung into existence\r\noutside their own lines.\r\n\r\nAdded to this their losses during the night had been something\r\nappalling. The streets were choked with their dead, and the houses\r\ninto which they had retired were filled with their wounded. So they,\r\ntoo, were glad of a rest, and many spoke openly of returning to their\r\nlines and abandoning the assault. If they did so it might be possible\r\nto fight their way to the coast, and escape out of this huge\r\ndeath-trap into which they had fallen on the very eve of their\r\nconfidently-anticipated victory.\r\n\r\nSo, during the whole of the 7th there was little or no hard fighting\r\nin London, but to the north and south the grey legions of the\r\nFederation fought their way mile by mile over the field of\r\nArmageddon, gradually driving in the two halves of the Russian and\r\nthe Franco-Italian armies which had been faced about to oppose their\r\nprogress while the other halves were making their assault on London.\r\n\r\nAs soon as news reached the Tsar that the blockade of the river had\r\nbeen broken, he had ordered twelve of his remaining war-balloons to\r\ndestroy the ships that were swarming below London Bridge. Their fuel\r\nand cargoes of explosives had been renewed, and they rose into the\r\nair to execute the Autocrat's command just as Natasha had taken leave\r\nof Arnold on her errand of mercy. He fathomed their design at once,\r\nswung the _Ithuriel_ rapidly round to the northward, and said to his\r\nlieutenant, who had just come on deck--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Marston, those fellows mean mischief. Put a three-minute time\r\nfuze on a couple of No. 3 fire-shell, and load the bow guns.\"\r\n\r\nThe order was at once executed. He trained one of the guns himself,\r\ngiving it an elevation sufficient to throw the shell over the rising\r\nballoons. As the sixtieth second of the first minute passed, he\r\nreleased the projectile. It soared away through the air, and burst\r\nwith a terrific explosion about fifty feet over the ascending\r\naerostats.\r\n\r\nThe rain of fire spread out far and wide, and showered down upon the\r\ngas-holders. Then came a concussion that shook the air like a\r\nthunder-clap as the escaping gas mixed with the air, took fire, and\r\nexploded. Seven of the twelve aerostats instantly collapsed and\r\nplunged back again to the earth, spending the collective force of\r\ntheir explosives on the slopes of Muswell Hill. Meanwhile the second\r\ngun had been loaded and fired with the same effect on the remaining\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nArnold then ran the _Ithuriel_ up to within a mile of Muswell Hill,\r\nand found the remaining thirteen war-balloons in the act of making\r\noff to the northward.\r\n\r\n\"Two more time-shells, quick!\" he cried. \"They are off to take part\r\nin the battle to the north, and must be stopped at once. Look lively,\r\nor they'll see us and rise out of range!\"\r\n\r\nAlmost before the words were out of his mouth one of the guns was\r\nready. A moment later the messenger of destruction was speeding on\r\nits way, and they saw it explode fairly in the midst of the squadron.\r\nThe second followed before the glare of the first explosion had\r\npassed, and this was the last shot fired in the aërial warfare\r\nbetween the air-ships and the war-balloons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The rain of fire spread out far and wide.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 344._]\r\n\r\nThe effects of these two shots were most extraordinary. The\r\naccurately-timed shells burst, not over, but amidst the aerostats,\r\nenveloping their cars in a momentary mist of fire. The intense heat\r\nevolved must have suffocated their crews instantaneously. Even if it\r\nhad not done so their fate would have been scarcely less sudden or\r\nterrible, for the fire falling in the cars exploded their own shells\r\neven before it burst their gas-envelopes. With a roar and a shock as\r\nthough heaven and earth were coming together, a vast dazzling mass of\r\nflame blazed out, darkening the daylight by contrast, and when it\r\nvanished again there was not a fragment of the thirteen aerostats to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n\"So ends the Tsar's brief empire of the air!\" said Arnold, as the\r\nsmoke of the explosion drifted away. \"And twenty-four hours more\r\nshould see the end of his earthly Empire as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" said Natasha's voice at his elbow. \"This awful\r\ndestruction is sickening me. I knew war was horrible, but this is\r\nmore like the work of fiends than of men. There is something\r\nmonstrous, something superhumanly impious, in blasting your\r\nfellow-creatures with irresistible lightnings like this, as though\r\nyou were a god instead of a man. Will you not be glad when it is\r\nover, Richard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad beyond all expression,\" replied her lover, the angry light of\r\nbattle instantly dying out of his eyes as he looked upon her sweetly\r\npitiful face. \"But tell me, what success has my angel of mercy had in\r\npleading for the lives of her enemies?\" he continued, slipping his\r\narm through hers, and leading her aft.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know yet, but my father told me to ask you to go to him as\r\nsoon as you could leave the deck. Go now, and, Richard, remember what\r\nI said to you when you offered me the empire of the world as we were\r\ngoing to Aeria. No one has such influence with the Master as you\r\nhave, for you have given him the victory and delivered his enemies\r\ninto his hands. For my sake, and for Humanity's, let your voice be\r\nfor mercy and peace--surely we have shed blood enough now!\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall, angel mine! For your sweet sake I would spare even\r\nAlexander Romanoff himself and all his Staff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will never be asked to do that,\" said Natasha quietly, as Arnold\r\ndisappeared down the companion-way.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly an hour before he came on deck again, and by this time\r\nthe _Ithuriel_, constantly moving to and fro over London, so that any\r\nchange in the course of events could be at once reported to Natas,\r\nhad shifted her position to the southward, and was hanging in the air\r\nover Sydenham Hill, the headquarters of General le Gallifet, whence\r\ncould be plainly heard the roar of the tide of battle as it rolled\r\never northward over the hills of Surrey.\r\n\r\nAn air-ship came speeding up from the southward as he reached the\r\ndeck. He signalled to it to come alongside. It proved to be the\r\n_Mercury_ taking a message from Tremayne, who was personally\r\ncommanding the Army of the South in the _Ariel_, to the air-ships\r\noperating with the Army of the North.\r\n\r\n\"What is the message?\" asked Arnold.\r\n\r\n\"To engage and destroy the remaining Russian war-balloons, and then\r\ncome south at once,\" replied the captain of the _Mercury_. \"I am\r\nsorry to say both the _Lucifer_ and the _Azrael_ have been disabled\r\nby chance shots striking their propellers. The _Lucifer_ was so badly\r\ninjured that she fell to the earth, and blew up with a perfectly\r\nawful explosion; but the _Azrael_ can still use her fan-wheels and\r\nstern propeller, though her air-planes are badly broken and twisted.\"\r\n\r\nArnold frowned at the bad news, but took no further notice of it\r\nbeyond saying--\r\n\r\n\"That is unfortunate; but, I suppose, some casualties were inevitable\r\nunder the circumstances.\" Then he added: \"I have already destroyed\r\nall that were left of the Tsar's war-balloons, but you can take the\r\nother part of the message. Where is the _Ariel_ to be found?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Mercury_ gave him the necessary directions, and\r\nthe two air-ships parted. Within an hour a council of war, consisting\r\nof Natas, Arnold, and Tremayne, was being held in the saloon of the\r\n_Ithuriel_, on the issue of which the lives of more than two millions\r\nof men depended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nVICTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a little after three o'clock in the afternoon when Natas,\r\nTremayne, and Arnold ended their deliberations in the saloon of the\r\n_Ithuriel_. At the same hour a council of war was being held by\r\nGenerals le Gallifet and Cosensz at the Crystal Palace Hotel,\r\nSydenham, where the two commanders had taken up their quarters.\r\n\r\nSince daybreak matters had assumed a very serious, if not desperate\r\naspect for the troops of the League to the south of London.\r\nCommunication had entirely ceased with the Tsar since the night\r\nbefore, and this could only mean that his Majesty had lost the\r\ncommand of the air, through the destruction or disablement of his\r\nfleet of aerostats. News from the force which had descended upon\r\nLondon told only of a fearful expenditure of life that had not\r\npurchased the slightest advantage.\r\n\r\nThe blockade had been broken on the east, and, therefore, all hope of\r\nreducing the city by famine was at an end. Their own war-balloons had\r\nbeen either captured or destroyed, thousands of their men had\r\ndeserted to the enemy, and multitudes more had been slain. Every\r\nposition was dominated by the captured aerostats and the air-ships of\r\nthe Terrorists. Even the building in which the council was being held\r\nmight be shattered to fragments at any moment by a discharge of their\r\nirresistible artillery.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was practically certain that within the next few hours\r\ntheir headquarters must be surrounded, and then their only choice\r\nwould lie between unconditional surrender and swift and inevitable\r\ndestruction by an aërial bombardment. Manifestly the time had come to\r\nmake terms if possible, and purchase their own safety and that of\r\ntheir remaining troops. Both the generals and every member of their\r\nrespective staffs saw clearly that victory was now a physical\r\nimpossibility, and so the immediate issue of the council was that\r\norders were given to hoist the white flag over the tricolour and the\r\nItalian standard on the summits of the two towers of the Crystal\r\nPalace, and on the flagstaffs over the headquarters.\r\n\r\nThese were at once seen by a squadron of air-ships coming from the\r\nnorth in obedience to Tremayne's summons, and within half an hour the\r\nsame squadron was seen returning from the south headed by the\r\nflagship, also flying, to the satisfaction of the two generals, the\r\nsignal of truce. The air-ships stopped over Sydenham and ranged\r\nthemselves in a circle with their guns pointing down upon the\r\nheadquarters, and the _Ariel_, with Tremayne on board, descended to\r\nwithin twenty feet of the ground in front of the hotel.\r\n\r\nAs she did so an officer wearing the uniform of a French General of\r\nDivision came forward, saluted, and said that he had a message for\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief of the Federation forces. Tremayne returned\r\nthe salute, and said briefly--\r\n\r\n\"I am here. What is the message?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am commissioned by General Gallifet, Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nSouthern Division, to request on his behalf the honour of an\r\naudience. He awaits you with General Cosensz in the hotel,\" replied\r\nthe Frenchman, gazing in undisguised admiration at the wonderful\r\ncraft which he now for the first time saw at close quarters.\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure. I will be with you in a moment,\" said Tremayne, and\r\nas he spoke the _Ariel_ settled gently down to the earth, and the\r\ngangway steps dropped from her bow.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the room in which the two generals were awaiting him,\r\nsurrounded by their brilliantly-uniformed staffs, he presented a\r\nstrange contrast to the men whose lives he held in the hollow of his\r\nhand. He was dressed in a dark tweed suit, with Norfolk jacket and\r\nknickerbockers, met by long shooting boots, just as though he was\r\nfresh from the moors, instead of from the battlefield on which the\r\nfate of the world was being decided. General le Gallifet advanced to\r\nmeet him with a puzzled look of half-recognition on his face, which\r\nwas at once banished by Tremayne holding out his hand without the\r\nslightest ceremony, and saying--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I see you recognise me, General!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, my Lord Alanmere, and, you will permit me to add, with the\r\nmost profound astonishment,\" replied the General, taking the\r\nproffered hand with a hearty grasp. \"May I venture to hope that with\r\nan old acquaintance our negotiations may prove all the easier?\"\r\n\r\nTremayne bowed and said--\r\n\r\n\"Rest assured, General, that they shall be as easy as my instructions\r\nwill permit me to make them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your instructions! But I thought\"--\r\n\r\n\"That I was in supreme command. So I am in a sense, but I am the\r\nlieutenant of Natas for all that, and in a case like this his word is\r\nlaw. But come, what terms do you propose?\"\r\n\r\n\"That truce shall be proclaimed for twenty-four hours; that the\r\ncommanders of the forces of the League shall meet this mysterious\r\nNatas, yourself, and the King of England, and arrange terms by which\r\nthe armies of France, Russia, and Italy shall be permitted to\r\nevacuate the country with the honours of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, General, I may as well tell you at once that those terms are\r\nimpossible,\" replied the Chief of the Federation quietly, but with a\r\nnote of inflexible determination in his voice. \"In the first place,\r\n'the honours of war' is a phrase which already belongs to the past.\r\nWe see no honour in war, and if we can have our way this shall be the\r\nlast war that shall ever be waged on earth.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I may tell you that we began this war as one of absolute\r\nextermination. Had it not been for the intercession of Natasha, the\r\ndaughter of Natas, you would not even have been given the opportunity\r\nof making terms of peace, or even of unconditional surrender. Our\r\norders were simply to slay, and spare not, as long as a man remained\r\nin arms on British soil. You are, of course, aware that we have taken\r\nno prisoners\"--\r\n\r\n\"But, my lord, this is not war, it is murder on the most colossal\r\nscale!\" exclaimed the General, utterly unable to control the\r\nagitation that these terrible words evoked, not only in his own\r\nbreast, but in that of every man who heard them.\r\n\r\n\"To us war and murder are synonymous terms, differing only as\r\nwholesale and retail,\" replied Tremayne drily; \"for the mere names we\r\ncare nothing. This world-war is none of our seeking; but if war can\r\nbe cured by nothing but war, then we will wage it to the point of\r\nextermination. Now here are my terms. All the troops of the League on\r\nthis side of the river Thames, on laying down their arms, shall be\r\npermitted to return to their homes, not as soldiers, but as peaceful\r\ncitizens of the world, to go about their natural business as men who\r\nhave sworn never to draw the sword again save in defence of their own\r\nhomes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And his Majesty the Tsar?\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot make terms for the Tsar, General, and let me beg of you\r\nnot to attempt to do so. No power under heaven can save him and his\r\nadvisers from the fate that awaits them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if we refuse your terms, the alternative is what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Annihilation to the last man!\"\r\n\r\nA dead silence followed these fearful words so calmly and yet so\r\ninflexibly spoken. General le Gallifet and the Italian\r\nCommander-in-Chief looked at one another and at the officers standing\r\nabout them. A murmur of horror and indignation passed from lip to\r\nlip. Then Tremayne spoke again quickly but impressively--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, don't think that I am saying what I cannot do. We are\r\ninflexibly determined to stamp the curse of war out here and now, if\r\nit cost millions of lives to do so. Your forces are surrounded, your\r\naerostats are captured or destroyed. It is no use mincing matters at\r\na moment like this. It is life or death with you. If you do not\r\nbelieve me, General le Gallifet, come with me and take a flight round\r\nLondon in my air-ship yonder, and your own eyes shall see how\r\nhopeless all further struggle is. I pledge my word of honour as an\r\nEnglish gentleman that you shall return in safety. Will you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said the French commander. \"Gentlemen, you will await my\r\nreturn\"; and with a bow to his companions, he followed the Chief out\r\nof the room, and embarked on the air-ship without further ado.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Do you understand now why you could not make terms\r\nfor Russia?\"\r\n\r\n_See page 351._]\r\n\r\nThe _Ariel_ at once rose into the air. Tremayne reported to Natas\r\nwhat had been done, and then took the General into the deck saloon,\r\nand gave orders to proceed at full speed to Richmond, which was\r\nreached in what seemed to the Frenchman an inconceivably short space\r\nof time. Then the _Ariel_ swung round to the eastward, and at half\r\nspeed traversed the whole line of battle over hill and vale, at an\r\nelevation of eight hundred feet, from Richmond to Shooter's Hill.\r\n\r\nWhat General le Gallifet saw more than convinced him that Tremayne\r\nhad spoken without exaggeration when he said that annihilation was\r\nthe only alternative to evacuation on his terms. The grey legions of\r\nthe League seemed innumerable. Their long lines lapped round the\r\nbroken squadrons of the League, mowing them down with incessant\r\nhailstorms of magazine fire, and overhead the air-ships and aerostats\r\nwere hurling shells on them which made great dark gaps in their\r\nformations wherever they attempted anything like order. Every\r\nposition of importance was either occupied or surrounded by the\r\nFederationists. There was no way open save towards London, and that\r\nway, as the General knew only too well, lay destruction.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Shooter's Hill the air-ship swerved round to the\r\nnorthward. The Thames was alive with steamers flying the red flag,\r\nand carrying food and men into London. To the north of the river the\r\nbattle had completely ceased as far as Muswell Hill.\r\n\r\nThere the Black Eagle of Russia still floated from the roof of the\r\nPalace, and a furious battle was raging round the slopes of the hill.\r\nBut the Russians were already surrounded, and manifestly outnumbered\r\nfive to one, while six aerostats were circling to and fro, doing\r\ntheir work of death upon them with fearful effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\"You see, General, that the aerostats do not destroy the Palace and\r\nbury the Tsar in its ruins, nor do I stop and do the same, as I could\r\ndo in a few minutes. Do you understand now why you could not make\r\nterms for Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"What your designs are Heaven and yourselves only know,\" replied the\r\nGeneral, with quivering lips. \"But I see that all is hopelessly lost.\r\nFor God's sake let this carnage stop! It is not war, it is butchery,\r\nand we have deserved this retribution for employing those infernal\r\ncontrivances in the first place. I always said it was not fair\r\nfighting. It is murder to drop death on defenceless men from the\r\nclouds. We will accept your terms. Let us get back to the south and\r\nsave the lives of what remain of our brave fellows. If this is\r\nscientific warfare, I, for one, will fight no more!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well spoken, General!\" said Tremayne, laying his hand upon his\r\nshoulder. \"Those words of yours have saved two millions of human\r\nlives, and by this time to-morrow war will have ceased, I hope for\r\never, among the nations of the West.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Ariel_ now swerved southward again, crossed London at full\r\nspeed, and within half an hour General le Gallifet was once more\r\nstanding in front of the Crystal Palace Hotel. As it was now getting\r\ndusk the searchlights of the air-ships were turned on, and they swept\r\nalong the southern line of battle flashing the signal, \"Victory!\r\nCease firing!\" to the triumphant hosts of the Federation, while at\r\nthe same time the French and Italian commanders set the field\r\ntelegraph to work and despatched messengers into London with the news\r\nof the terms of peace. By nightfall all fighting south of the Thames\r\nhad ceased, and victors and vanquished were fraternising as though\r\nthey had never struck a blow at each other, for war is a matter of\r\ndiplomacy and Court intrigue, and not of personal animosity. The\r\npeoples of the world would be good enough friends if their rulers and\r\npoliticians would let them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the battle raged with unabated fury round the headquarters\r\nof the Tsar. Here despotism was making its last stand, and making it\r\nbravely, in spite of the tremendous odds against it. But as twilight\r\ndeepened into night the numbers of the assailants of the last of the\r\nRussian positions seemed to multiply miraculously.\r\n\r\nA never-ceasing flood of grey-clad soldiery surged up from the south,\r\noverflowed the barricades to the north, and swept the last of the\r\nRussians out of the streets like so much chaff. All the hundred\r\nstreams converged upon Muswell Hill, and joined the ranks of the\r\nattacking force, and so the night fell upon the last struggle of the\r\nworld-war. Even the Tsar himself now saw that the gigantic game was\r\nvirtually over, and that the stake of world-empire had been played\r\nfor--and lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A vision which no one who saw it forgot to the day of\r\nhis death.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 353._]\r\n\r\nA powerful field searchlight had been fixed on the roof of the\r\nPalace, and, as it flashed hither and thither round the area of the\r\nbattle, he saw fresh hosts of the British and Federation soldiers\r\npouring in upon the scene of action, while his own men were being\r\nmown down by thousands under the concentrated fire of millions of\r\nrifles, and his regiments torn to fragments by the incessant storm of\r\nexplosives from the sky.\r\n\r\nHour after hour the savage fight went on, and the grey and red lines\r\nfought their way up and up the slopes, drawing the ring of flame and\r\nsteel closer and closer round the summit of the hill on which the\r\nAutocrat of the North stood waiting for the hour of his fate to\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nThe last line of the defenders of the position was reached at length.\r\nFor an hour it held firm in spite of the fearful odds. Then it\r\nwavered and bent, and swayed to and fro in a last agony of\r\ndesperation. The encircling lines seemed to surge backwards for a\r\nspace. Then came a wild chorus of hurrahs, a swift forward rush of\r\nlevelled bayonets, the clash of steel upon steel--and then butchery,\r\nvengeful and pitiless.\r\n\r\nThe red tide of slaughter surged up to the very walls of the Palace.\r\nOnly a few yards separated the foremost ranks of the victorious\r\nassailants from the little group of officers, in the midst of which\r\ntowered the majestic figure of the White Tsar--an emperor without an\r\nempire, a leader without an army. He strode forward towards the line\r\nof bayonets fringing the crest of the hill, drew his sword, snapped\r\nthe blade as a man would break a dry stick, and threw the two pieces\r\nto the ground, saying in English as he did so--\r\n\r\n\"It is enough, I surrender!\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned on his heel, and with bowed head walked back again to\r\nhis Staff.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment a blaze of white light appeared in the sky,\r\na hundred feet above the heads of the vast throng that encircled the\r\nPalace. Millions of eyes were turned up at once, and beheld a vision\r\nwhich no one who saw it forgot to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nThe ten air-ships of the Terrorist fleet were ranged in two curves on\r\neither side of the _Ithuriel_, which floated about twenty feet below\r\nthem, her silvery hull bathed in a flood of light from their electric\r\nlamps. In her bow, robed in glistening white fur, stood Natasha,\r\ntransfigured in the full blaze of the concentrated searchlights. A\r\nsilence of wonder and expectation fell upon the millions at her feet,\r\nand in the midst of it she began to sing the Hymn of Freedom. It was\r\nlike the voice of an angel singing in the night of peace after\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\nMen of every nation in Europe listened to her entranced, as she\r\nchanged from language to language; and when at last the triumphant\r\nstrains of the Song of the Revolution came floating down from her\r\nlips through the still night air, an irresistible impulse ran through\r\nthe listening millions, and with one accord they took up the refrain\r\nin all the languages of Europe, and a mighty flood of exultant song\r\nrolled up in wave after wave from earth to heaven,--a song at once of\r\nvictory and thanksgiving, for the last battle of the world-war had\r\nbeen lost and won, and the valour and genius of Anglo-Saxondom had\r\ntriumphed over the last of the despotisms of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF NATAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe myriad-voiced chorus of the Song of the Revolution ended in a\r\nmighty shout of jubilant hurrahs, in the midst of which the _Ariel_\r\ndropped lightly to the earth, and Tremayne, dressed now in the grey\r\nuniform of the Federation, with a small red rosette on the left\r\nbreast of his tunic, descended from her deck to the ground with a\r\ndrawn sword in his hand.\r\n\r\nHe was at once recognised by several of the leaders, and as the\r\nwords, \"The Chief, the Chief,\" ran from lip to lip, those in the\r\nfront ranks brought their rifles to the present, while the captains\r\nsaluted with their swords. The British regulars and volunteers\r\nfollowed suit as if by instinct, and the chorus of cheers broke out\r\nagain. Tremayne acknowledged the salute, and raised his hand to\r\ncommand silence. A hush at once fell upon the assembled multitude,\r\nand in the deep silence of anticipation which followed, he said in\r\nclear, ringing tones--\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers of the Federation and the Empire! that which I hope will be\r\nthe last battle of the Western nations has been fought and won. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon race has rallied to the defence of its motherland, and in\r\nthe blood of its invaders has wiped out the stain of conquest. It has\r\nmet the conquerors of Europe in arms, and on the field of battle it\r\nhas vindicated its right to the empire of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth the destinies of the human race are in its keeping, and\r\nit will worthily discharge the responsibility. It may yet be\r\nnecessary for you to fight other battles with other races; but the\r\nvictory that has attended you here will wait upon your arms\r\nelsewhere, and then the curse and the shame of war will be removed\r\nfrom the earth, let us hope for ever. European despotism has fought\r\nits last battle and lost, and those who have appealed to the sword\r\nshall be judged by the sword.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he pointed with his weapon towards the Tsar and his\r\nStaff, and continued, with an added sternness in his voice--\r\n\r\n\"In the Master's name, take those men prisoners! Their fate will be\r\ndecided to-morrow. Forward a company of the First Division; your\r\nlives will answer for theirs!\"\r\n\r\nAs the Chief ended his brief address to the victorious troops ten\r\nmen, armed with revolver and sword, stepped forward, each followed by\r\nten others armed with rifle and fixed bayonet, and immediately formed\r\nin a hollow square round the Tsar and his Staff. This summary\r\nproceeding proved too much for the outraged dignity of the fallen\r\nAutocrat, and he stepped forward and cried out passionately--\r\n\r\n\"What is this? Is not my surrender enough? Have we not fought with\r\ncivilised enemies, that we are to be treated like felons in the hour\r\nof defeat?\"\r\n\r\nTremayne raised his sword and cried sharply, \"To the ready!\" and\r\ninstantly the prisoners were encircled by a hedge of levelled\r\nbayonets and rifle-barrels charged with death. Then he went on, in\r\nstern commanding tones--\r\n\r\n\"Silence there! We do not recognise what you call the usages of\r\ncivilised warfare. You are criminals against humanity, assassins by\r\nwholesale, and as such you shall be treated.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to submit to the indignity, and within a\r\nfew minutes the Tsar and those who with him had essayed the\r\nenslavement of the world were lodged in separate rooms in the\r\nbuilding under a strong guard to await the fateful issue of the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the night was occupied in digging huge trenches for the\r\nburial of the almost innumerable dead, a task which, gigantic as it\r\nwas, was made light by the work of hundreds of thousands of willing\r\nhands. Those of the invaders who had fallen in London itself were\r\ntaken down the Thames on the ebb tide in fleets of lighters, towed by\r\nsteamers, and were buried at sea. Happily it was midwinter, and the\r\ntemperature remained some degrees below freezing point, and so the\r\ngreat city was saved from what in summer would infallibly have\r\nbrought pestilence in the track of war.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock on the following day the vast interior of St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral was thronged with the anxious spectators of the last\r\nscene in the tremendous tragedy which had commenced with the\r\ndestruction of Kronstadt by the _Ariel_, and which had culminated in\r\nthe triumph of Anglo-Saxondom over the leagued despotism and\r\nmilitarism of Europe.\r\n\r\nAt a long table draped with red cloth, and placed under the dome in\r\nfront of the chancel steps, sat Natas, with Tremayne and Natasha on\r\nhis right hand, and Arnold and Alexis Mazanoff on his left. Radna,\r\nAnna Ornovski, and the other members of the Inner Circle of the\r\nTerrorists, including the President, Nicholas Roburoff, who had been\r\npardoned and restored to his office at the intercession of Natasha,\r\noccupied the other seats, and behind them stood a throng of the\r\nleaders of the Federation forces.\r\n\r\nNeither the King of England nor any of his Ministers or military\r\nofficers were present, as they had no voice in the proceedings which\r\nwere about to take place. It had been decided, at a consultation with\r\nthem earlier in the day, that it would be better that they should be\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nThat which was to be done was unparalleled in the history of the\r\nworld, and outside the recognised laws of nations; and so their\r\nprejudices were respected, and they were spared what they might have\r\nlooked upon as an outrage on international policy, and the ancient\r\nbut mistaken traditions of so-called civilised warfare.\r\n\r\nIn front of the table two double lines of Federation soldiers, with\r\nrifles and fixed bayonets, kept a broad clear passage down to the\r\nwestern doors of the Cathedral. The murmur of thousands of voices\r\nsuddenly hushed as the Cathedral clock struck the first stroke of\r\ntwelve. It was the knell of an empire and a despotism. At the last\r\nstroke Natas raised his hand and said--\r\n\r\n\"Bring up the prisoners!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a quick rustling sound, mingled with the clink of steel, as\r\nthe two grey lines stiffened up to attention. Twelve commanders of\r\ndivisions marched with drawn swords down to the end of the nave, a\r\nfew rapid orders were given, and then they returned heading two\r\ndouble files of Federation guards, between which, handcuffed like\r\ncommon felons, walked the once mighty Tsar and the ministers of his\r\nnow departed tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps of the soldiers and their captives rang clearly upon\r\nthe stones in the ominous breathless silence which greeted their\r\nappearance. The fallen Autocrat and his servants walked with downcast\r\nheads, like men in a dream, for to them it was a dream, this sudden\r\nand incomprehensible catastrophe which had overwhelmed them in the\r\nvery hour of victory and on the threshold of the conquest of the\r\nworld. Three days ago they had believed themselves conquerors, with\r\nthe world at their feet; now they were being marched, guarded and in\r\nshackles, to a tribunal which acknowledged no law but its own, and\r\nfrom whose decision there was no appeal. Truly it was a dream, such a\r\ndream of disaster and calamity as no earthly despot had ever dreamt\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nFour paces from the table they were halted, the Tsar in the centre,\r\nfacing his unknown judge, and his servants on either side of him. He\r\nrecognised Natasha, Anna Ornovski, Arnold, and Tremayne, but the\r\nrecognition only added to his bewilderment.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight flush on the face of Natas, and an angry gleam in\r\nhis dark magnetic eyes, as he watched his captives approach; but when\r\nhe spoke his tones were calm and passionless, the tones of the\r\nconqueror and the judge, rather than of the deeply injured man and a\r\npersonal enemy. As the prisoners were halted in front of the table,\r\nand the rifle-butts of the guards rang sharply on the stone pavement,\r\nso deep a hush fell upon the vast throng in the Cathedral, that men\r\nseemed to hold their breath rather than break it until the Master of\r\nthe Terror began to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Alexander Romanoff, late Tsar of the Russias, and now prisoner of\r\nthe Executive of the Brotherhood of Freedom, otherwise known to you\r\nas the Terrorists--you have been brought here with your advisers and\r\nthe ministers of your tyranny that your crimes may be recounted in\r\nthe presence of this congregation, and to receive sentence of such\r\npunishment as it is possible for human justice to mete out to you\"--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Two bayonets crossed in front of him with a sharp\r\nclash.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 359._]\r\n\r\n\"I deny both your justice and your right to judge. It is you who are\r\nthe criminals, conspirators, and enemies of Society. I am a crowned\r\nKing, and above all earthly laws\"--\r\n\r\nBefore he could say any more two bayonets crossed in front of him\r\nwith a sharp clash, and he was instantly thrust back into his place.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" said Natas, in a tone of such stern command that even he\r\ninstinctively obeyed. \"As for our justice, let that be decided\r\nbetween you and me when we stand before a more awful tribunal than\r\nthis. My right to judge even a crowned king who has no longer a\r\ncrown, rests, as your own authority and that of all earthly rulers\r\nhas ever done, upon the power to enforce my sentence, and I can and\r\nwill enforce it upon you, you heir of a usurping murderess, whose\r\nthrone was founded in blood and supported by the bayonets of her\r\nhired assassins. You have appealed to the arbitration of battle, and\r\nit has decided against you; you must therefore abide by its decision.\r\n\r\n\"You have waged a war of merciless conquest at the bidding of\r\ninsatiable ambition. You have posed as the peace-keeper of Europe\r\nuntil the train of war was laid, as you and your allies thought, in\r\nsecret, and then you let loose the forces of havoc upon your\r\nfellow-men without ruth or scruple. Your path of victory has been\r\ntraced in blood and flames from one end of Europe to the other; you\r\nhave sacrificed the lives of millions, and the happiness of millions\r\nmore, to a dream of world-wide empire, which, if realised, would have\r\nbeen a universal despotism.\r\n\r\n\"The blood of the uncounted slain cries out from earth to heaven\r\nagainst you for vengeance. The days are past when those who made war\r\nupon their kind could claim the indulgence of their conquerors. You\r\nhave been conquered by those who hold that the crime of aggressive\r\nwar cannot be atoned for by the transfer of territory or the payment\r\nof money.\r\n\r\n\"If this were your only crime we would have blood for blood, and life\r\nfor life, as far as yours could pay the penalty. But there is more\r\nthan this to be laid to our charge, and the swift and easy punishment\r\nof death would be too light an atonement for Justice to accept.\r\n\r\n\"Since you ascended your throne you have been as the visible shape of\r\nGod in the eyes of a hundred million subjects. Your hands have held\r\nthe power of life and death, of freedom and slavery, of happiness and\r\nmisery. How have you used it, you who have arrogated to yourself the\r\nattributes of a vicegerent of God on earth? As the power is, so too\r\nis the responsibility, and it will not avail you now to shelter\r\nyourself from it behind the false traditions of diplomacy and\r\nstatecraft.\r\n\r\n\"Your subjects have starved, while you and yours have feasted. You\r\nhave lavished millions in vain display upon your palaces, while they\r\nhave died in their hovels for lack of bread; and when men have asked\r\nyou for freedom and justice, you have given them the knout, the\r\nchain, and the prison.\r\n\r\n\"You have parted the wife from her husband\"--\r\n\r\nHere for the moment the voice of Natas trembled with irrepressible\r\npassion, which, before he could proceed, broke from his heaving\r\nbreast in a deep sob that thrilled the vast assembly like an electric\r\nshock, and made men clench their hands and grit their teeth, and\r\nwrung an answering sob from the breast of many a woman who knew but\r\ntoo well the meaning of those simple yet terrible words. Then Natas\r\nrecovered his outward composure and went on; but now there was an\r\nangrier gleam in his eyes, and a fiercer ring in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"You have parted the wife from her husband, the maid from her lover,\r\nthe child from its parents. You have made desolate countless homes\r\nthat once were happy, and broken hearts that had no thought of evil\r\ntowards you--and you have done all this, and more, to maintain as\r\nvile a despotism as ever insulted the justice of man, or mocked at\r\nthe mercy of God.\r\n\r\n\"In the inscrutable workings of Eternal Justice it has come to pass\r\nthat your sentence shall be uttered by the lips of one of your\r\nvictims. For no offence known to the laws of earth or Heaven my flesh\r\nhas been galled by your chains and torn by your whips. I have toiled\r\nto win your ill-gotten wealth in your mines, and by the hands of your\r\nbrutal servants the iron has entered into my soul. Yet I am but one\r\nof thousands whose undeserved agony cries out against you in this\r\nhour of judgment.\r\n\r\n\"Can you give us back what you have taken from us--the years of life\r\nand health and happiness, our wives and our children, our lovers and\r\nour kindred? You have ravished, but you cannot restore. You have\r\nsmitten, but you cannot heal. You have killed, but you cannot make\r\nalive again. If you had ten thousand lives they could not atone,\r\nthough each were dragged out to the bitter end in the misery that you\r\nhave meted out to others.\r\n\r\n\"But so far as you and yours can pay the debt it shall be paid to the\r\nuttermost farthing. Every pang that you have inflicted you shall\r\nendure. You shall drag your chains over Siberian snows, and when you\r\nfaint by the wayside the lash shall revive you, as in the hands of\r\nyour brutal Cossacks it has goaded on your fainting victims. You\r\nshall sweat in the mine and shiver in the cell, and your wives and\r\nyour children shall look upon your misery and be helpless to help\r\nyou, even as have been the fond ones who have followed your victims\r\nto exile and death.\r\n\r\n\"They have seen your crimes without protest, and shared in your\r\nwantonness. They have toyed with the gold and jewels which they knew\r\nwere bought with the price of misery and death, and so it is just\r\nthat they should see your sufferings and share in your doom.\r\n\r\n\"To the mines for life! And when the last summons comes to you and\r\nme, may Eternal Justice judge between us, and in its equal scales\r\nweigh your crimes against your punishment! Begone! for you have\r\nlooked your last on freedom. You are no longer men; you are outcasts\r\nfrom the pale of the brotherhood of the humanity you have outraged!\r\n\r\n\"Alexis Mazanoff, you will hold yourself responsible for the lives of\r\nthe prisoners, and the execution of their sentence. You will see them\r\nin safe keeping for the present, and on the thirtieth day from now\r\nyou will set out for Siberia.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence of Natas, the most terrible one which human lips could\r\nhave uttered under the circumstances, was received with a breathless\r\nsilence of awe and horror. Then Mazanoff rose from his seat, drew his\r\nsword, and saluted. As he passed round the end of the table the\r\nguards closed up round the prisoners, who were staring about them in\r\nstupefied bewilderment at the incredible horror of the fate which in\r\na moment had hurled them from the highest pinnacle of earthly power\r\nand splendour down to the degradation and misery of the most wretched\r\nof their own Siberian convicts. No time was given for protest or\r\nappeal, for Mazanoff instantly gave the word \"Forward!\" and,\r\nsurrounded by a hedge of bayonets, the doomed men were marched\r\nrapidly down between the two grey lines.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the bottom of the nave the great central doors swung\r\nopen, and through them came a mighty roar of execration from the\r\nmultitude outside as they appeared on the top of the Cathedral steps.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Paul's Churchyard, down through Ludgate Hill and up the Old\r\nBailey to the black frowning walls of Newgate, they were led through\r\ntriple lines of Federation soldiers amidst a storm of angry cries\r\nfrom the crowd on either side,--cries which changed to a wild\r\noutburst of savage, pitiless exultation as the news of their dreadful\r\nsentence spread rapidly from lip to lip. They had shed blood like\r\nwater, and had known no pity in the hour of their brief triumph, and\r\nso none was shown for them in the hour of their fall and retribution.\r\n\r\nThe hour following their disappearance from the Cathedral was spent\r\nin a brief and simple service of thanksgiving for the victory which\r\nhad wiped the stain of foreign invasion from the soil of Britain in\r\nthe blood of the invader, and given the control of the destinies of\r\nthe Western world finally into the hands of the dominant race of\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe service began with a short but eloquent address from Natas, in\r\nwhich he pointed out the consequences of the victory and the\r\ntremendous responsibilities to the generations of men in the present\r\nand the future which it entailed upon the victors. He concluded with\r\nthe following words--\r\n\r\n\"My own part in this world-revolution is played out. For more than\r\ntwenty years I have lived solely for the attainment of one object,\r\nthe removal of the blot of Russian tyranny upon European\r\ncivilisation, and the necessary punishment of those who were guilty\r\nof the unspeakable crime of maintaining it at such a fearful expense\r\nof human life and suffering.\r\n\r\n\"That object has now been accomplished; the soldiers of freedom have\r\nmet the hirelings of despotism on the field of the world's\r\nArmageddon, and the God of Battles has decided between them. Our\r\nmotives may have been mistaken by those who only saw the bare outward\r\nappearance without knowing their inward intention, and our ends have\r\nnaturally been misjudged by those who fancied that their\r\naccomplishment meant their own ruin.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, as the events have proved, and will prove in the ages to come,\r\nwe have been but as intelligent instruments in the hands of that\r\neternal wisdom and justice which, though it may seem to sleep for a\r\nseason, and permit the evildoer to pursue his wickedness for a space,\r\nnever closes the eye of watchfulness or sheathes the sword of\r\njudgment. The empire of the earth has been given into the hands of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon race, and therefore it is fitting that the supreme\r\ncontrol of affairs should rest in the hands of one of Anglo-Saxon\r\nblood and lineage.\r\n\r\n\"For that reason I now surrender the power which I have so far\r\nexercised as the Master of the Brotherhood of Freedom into the hands\r\nof Alan Tremayne, known in Britain as Earl of Alanmere and Baron\r\nTremayne, and from this moment the Brotherhood of Freedom ceases to\r\nexist as such, for its ends are attained, and the objects for which\r\nit was founded have been accomplished.\r\n\r\n\"With the confidence born of intimate knowledge, I give this power\r\ninto his keeping, and those who have shared his counsels and executed\r\nhis commands in the past will in the future assist him as the Supreme\r\nCouncil, which will form the ultimate tribunal to which the disputes\r\nof nations will henceforth be submitted, instead of to the barbarous\r\nand bloody arbitration of battle.\r\n\r\n\"No such power has ever been delivered into the hands of a single\r\nbody of men before; but those who will hold it have been well tried,\r\nand they may be trusted to wield it without pride and without\r\nselfishness, the twin curses that have hitherto afflicted the divided\r\nnations of the earth, because, with the fate of humanity in their\r\nhands and the wealth of earth at their disposal, it will be\r\nimpossible to tempt them with bribes, either of riches or of power,\r\nfrom the plain course of duty which will lie before them.\"\r\n\r\nAs Natas finished speaking, he signed with his hand to Tremayne, who\r\nrose in his place and briefly addressed the assembly--\r\n\r\n\"I and those who will share it with me accept alike the power and the\r\nresponsibility--not of choice, but rather because we are convinced\r\nthat the interests of humanity demand that we should do so. Those\r\ninterests have too long been the sport of kings and their courtiers,\r\nand of those who have seen in selfish profit and aggrandisement the\r\nonly ends of life worth living for.\r\n\r\n\"Under the pretences of furthering civilisation and progress, and\r\nmaintaining what they have been pleased to call law and order, they\r\nhave perpetrated countless crimes of oppression, cruelty, and\r\nextortion, and we are determined that this shall have an end.\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth, so far as we can insure it, the world shall be ruled,\r\nnot by the selfishness of individuals, or the ambitions of nations,\r\nbut in accordance with the everlasting and immutable principles of\r\ntruth and justice, which have hitherto been burlesqued alike by\r\ndespots on their thrones and by political partisans in the senates of\r\nso-called democratic countries.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, at mid-day in this place, the chief rulers of Europe will\r\nmeet us, and our intentions will be further explained. And now before\r\nwe separate to go about the rest of the business of the day let us,\r\nas is fitting, give due thanks to Him who has given us the victory.\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased speaking, but remained standing; the same instant the organ\r\nof the Cathedral pealed out the opening notes of the familiar\r\nNormanton Chant, and all those at the table, saving Natas, rose to\r\ntheir feet. Then Natasha's voice soared up clear and strong above the\r\norgan notes, singing the first line of the old well-known chant--\r\n\r\n  The strain upraise of joy and praise.\r\n\r\nAnd as she ceased the swell of the organ rolled out, and a mighty\r\nchorus of hallelujahs burst by one consent from the lips of the vast\r\ncongregation, filling the huge Cathedral, and flowing out from its\r\nnow wide-open doors until it was caught up and echoed by the\r\nthousands who thronged the churchyard and the streets leading into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs this died away Radna sang the second line, and so the Psalm of\r\nPraise was sung through, as it were in strophe and anti-strophe,\r\ninterspersed with the jubilant hallelujahs of the multitude who were\r\ncelebrating the greatest victory that had ever been won on earth.\r\n\r\nThat night the inhabitants of the delivered city gave themselves up\r\nto such revelry and rejoicing as had never been seen or heard in\r\nLondon since its foundation. The streets and squares blazed with\r\nlights and resounded with the songs and cheerings of a people\r\ndelivered from an impending catastrophe which had bidden fair to\r\noverwhelm it in ruin, and bring upon it calamities which would have\r\nbeen felt for generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDERING OF EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these events had been in progress three squadrons of air-ships\r\nhad been speeding to St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Rome. Three vessels\r\nhad been despatched to each city, and the instructions of those in\r\ncommand of the squadrons were to bring the German Emperor, the\r\nEmperor of Austria, and the King of Italy to London.\r\n\r\nThe news of the defeat of the League had preceded them by telegraph,\r\nand all three monarchs willingly obeyed the summons which they\r\ncarried to attend a Conference for the ordering of affairs of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor was at once released from his captivity, although\r\nonly under a threat of the destruction of the city by the air-ships,\r\nfor the Grand Duke Vladimir, who ruled at St. Petersburg as deputy of\r\nthe Tsar, had first refused to believe the astounding story of the\r\ndefeat of his brother and the destruction of his army. The terrible\r\nachievements of the air-ships were, however, too well and too\r\ncertainly known to permit of resistance by force, and so the Kaiser\r\nwas released, and made his first aërial voyage from St. Petersburg to\r\nLondon, arriving there at ten o'clock on the evening of the 8th, in\r\nthe midst of the jubilations of the rejoicing city.\r\n\r\nThe King of England had sent a despatch to the Emperor of Austria\r\ninviting him to the Conference, and General Cosensz had sent a\r\nsimilar one to the King of Italy, and so there had been no difficulty\r\nabout their coming. At mid-day on the 9th the Conference was opened\r\nin St. Paul's, which was the only public building left intact in\r\nLondon capable of containing the vast audience that was present, an\r\naudience composed of men of every race and language in Europe.\r\n\r\nNatas was absent, and Tremayne occupied his seat in the centre of the\r\ntable; the other members of the Inner Circle, now composing the\r\nSupreme Council of the Federation, were present, with the exception\r\nof Natasha, Radna, and Anna Ornovski, and the other seats at the\r\ntable were occupied by the monarchs to whom the purposes of the\r\nConference had been explained earlier in the day. France was\r\nrepresented in the person of General le Gallifet.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Cathedral was filled to overflowing, with the\r\nexception of an open space kept round the table by the Federation\r\nguards.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings commenced with a brief but impressive religious\r\nservice conducted by the Primate of England, who ended it with a\r\nshort but earnest appeal, delivered from the altar steps, to those\r\ncomposing the Conference, calling upon them to conduct their\r\ndeliberations with justice and moderation, and reminding them of the\r\nmillions who were waiting in other parts of Europe for the blessings\r\nof peace and prosperity which it was now in their power to confer\r\nupon them. As the Archbishop concluded the prayer for the blessing of\r\nHeaven upon their deliberation, with which he ended his address,\r\nTremayne, after a few moments of silence, rose in his place and,\r\nspeaking in clear deliberate tones, began as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesties have been called together to hear the statement of\r\nthe practical issues of the conflict which has been decided between\r\nthe armies of the Federation of the Anglo-Saxon peoples and those of\r\nthe late Franco-Slavonian League.\r\n\r\n\"Into the motives which led myself and those who have acted with me\r\nto take the part which we have done in this tremendous struggle,\r\nthere is now no need for me to enter. It is rather with results than\r\nwith motives that we have to deal, and those results may be very\r\nbriefly stated.\r\n\r\n\"We have demonstrated on the field of battle that we hold in our\r\nhands means of destruction against which it is absolutely impossible\r\nfor any army fortress or fleet to compete with the slightest hope of\r\nvictory; and more than this, we are in command of the only organised\r\narmy and fleet now on land or sea. We have been compelled by the\r\nnecessities of the case to use our powers unsparingly up to a certain\r\npoint. That we have not used them beyond that point, as we might have\r\ndone, to enslave the world, is the best proof that I can give of the\r\nhonesty of our purposes with regard to the future.\r\n\r\n\"But it must never be forgotten that these powers remain with us, and\r\ncan be evoked afresh should necessity ever arise.\r\n\r\n\"It is not our purpose to enter upon a war of conquest, or upon a\r\nseries of internal revolutions in the different countries of Europe,\r\nthe issue of which might be the subversion of all order, and the\r\nnecessity for universal conquest on our part in order to restore it.\r\n\r\n\"With two exceptions the internal affairs of all the nations of\r\nEurope, saving only Russia, which for the present we shall govern\r\ndirectly, will be left undisturbed. The present tenure of land will\r\nbe abolished, and the only rights to the possession of it that will\r\nbe recognised will be occupation and cultivation. Experience has\r\nshown that the holding of land for mere purposes of luxury or\r\nspeculative profit leads to untold injustices to the general\r\npopulation of a country. The land on which cities and towns are built\r\nwill henceforth belong to the municipalities, and the rents of the\r\nbuildings will be paid in lieu of taxation.\r\n\r\n\"The other exception is even more important than this. We have waged\r\nwar in order that it may be waged no more, and we are determined that\r\nit shall now cease for ever. The peoples of the various nations have\r\nno interest in warfare. It has been nothing but an affliction and a\r\ncurse to them, and we are convinced that if one generation grows up\r\nwithout drawing the sword, it will never be drawn again as long as\r\nmen remain upon the earth. All existing fortifications will therefore\r\nbe at once destroyed, standing armies will be disbanded, and all the\r\nwarships in the world, which cannot be used for peaceful purposes,\r\nwill be sent to the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"For the maintenance of peace and order each nation will maintain a\r\nbody of police, in which all citizens between the ages of twenty and\r\nforty will serve in rotation, and this police will be under the\r\ncontrol, first of the Sovereign and Parliament of the country, and\r\nultimately of an International Board, which will sit once a year in\r\neach of the capitals of Europe in turn, and from whose decision there\r\nwill be no appeal.\r\n\r\n\"The possession of weapons of warfare, save by the members of this\r\nforce, will be forbidden under penalty of death, as we shall\r\npresuppose that no man can possess such weapons save with intent to\r\nkill, and all killing, save execution for murder, will henceforth be\r\ntreated as murder. Declaration of war by one country upon another\r\nwill be held to be a national crime, and, should such an event ever\r\noccur, the forces of the Anglo-Saxon Federation will be at once armed\r\nby authority of the Supreme Council, and the guilty nation will be\r\ncrushed and its territories will be divided among its neighbours.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the broad outlines of the course which we intend to pursue,\r\nand all I have now to do is to commend them to your earnest\r\nconsideration in the name of those over whom you are the constituted\r\nrulers.\"\r\n\r\nAs the President of the Federation sat down the German Emperor rose\r\nand said in a tone which showed that he had heard the speech with but\r\nlittle satisfaction--\r\n\r\n\"From what we have heard it would seem that the Federation of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon peoples considers itself as having conquered the world,\r\nand as being, therefore, in a position to dictate terms to all the\r\npeoples of the earth. Am I correct in this supposition?\"\r\n\r\nTremayne bowed in silence, and he continued--\r\n\r\n\"But this amounts to the destruction of the liberties of all peoples\r\nwho are not of the Anglo-Saxon race. It seems impossible to me to\r\nbelieve that free-born men who have won their liberty upon the\r\nbattlefield will ever consent to submit to a despotism such as this.\r\nWhat if they refuse to do so?\"\r\n\r\nTremayne was on his feet in an instant. He turned half round and\r\nfaced the Kaiser, with a frown on his brow and an ominous gleam in\r\nhis eyes--\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty of Germany may call it a despotism if you choose, but\r\nremember that it is a despotism of peace and not of war, and that it\r\naffects only those who would be peace-breakers and drawers of the\r\nsword upon their fellow-creatures. I regret that you have made it\r\nnecessary for me to remind you that we have conquered your\r\nconquerors, and that the despotism from which we have delivered the\r\nnations of Europe would infallibly have been ten thousand times worse\r\nthan that which you are pleased to miscall by the name.\r\n\r\n\"You deplore the loss of the right and the power to draw the sword\r\none upon another. Well, now, take that right back again for the last\r\ntime! Say here, and now, that you will not acknowledge the supremacy\r\nof the Council of the Federation, and take the consequences!\r\n\r\n\"Our soldiers are still in the field, our aërial fleet is still in\r\nthe air, and our sea-navy is under steam. But, remember, if you\r\nappeal to the sword it shall be with you as it was with Alexander\r\nRomanoff and the Russian force which invaded England. We have\r\nannihilated the army to a man, and exiled the Autocrat for life.\r\nChoose now, peace or war, and let those who would choose war with you\r\ntake their stand beside you, and we will fight another Armageddon!\"\r\n\r\nThe pregnant and pitiless words brought the Kaiser to his senses in\r\nan instant. He remembered that his army was destroyed, his strongest\r\nfortresses dismantled, his treasury empty, and the manhood of his\r\ncountry decimated. He turned white to the lips and sank back into his\r\nchair, covered his face with his hands, and sobbed aloud. And so\r\nended the last and only protest made by the spirit of militarism\r\nagainst the new despotism of peace.\r\n\r\nOne by one the monarchs now rose in their places, bowed to the\r\ninevitable, and gave their formal adherence to the new order of\r\nthings. General le Gallifet came last. When he had affixed his\r\nsignature to the written undertaking of allegiance which they had all\r\nsigned, he said, speaking in French--\r\n\r\n\"I was born and bred a soldier, and my life has been passed either in\r\nwarfare or the study of it. I have now drawn the sword for the last\r\ntime, save to defend France from invasion. I have seen enough of\r\nmodern war, or, as I should rather call it, murder by machinery, for\r\nsuch it only is now. They spoke truly who prophesied that the\r\nsolution of the problem of aërial navigation would make war\r\nimpossible. It has made it impossible, because it has made it too\r\nunspeakably horrible for humanity to tolerate it.\r\n\r\n\"In token of the honesty of my belief I ask now that France and\r\nGermany shall bury their long blood-feud on their last battlefield,\r\nand in the persons of his German Majesty and myself shake hands in\r\nthe presence of this company as a pledge of national forgiveness and\r\nperpetual peace.\"\r\n\r\nAs he ceased speaking, he turned and held out his hand to the Kaiser.\r\nAll eyes were turned on William II, to see how he would receive this\r\nappeal. For a moment he hesitated, then his manhood and chivalry\r\nconquered his pride and national prejudice, and amidst the cheers of\r\nthe great assembly, he grasped the outstretched hand of his\r\nhereditary enemy, saying in a voice broken by emotion--\r\n\r\n\"So be it. Since the sword is broken for ever, let us forget that we\r\nhave been enemies, and remember only that we are neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nThis ended the public portion of the Conference. From St. Paul's\r\nthose who had composed it went to Buckingham Palace, in the grounds\r\nof which the aërial fleet was reposing on the lawns under a strong\r\nguard of Federation soldiers. Here they embarked, and were borne\r\nswiftly through the air to Windsor Castle, where they dined together\r\nas friends and guests of the King of England, and after dinner\r\ndiscussed far on into the night the details of the new European\r\nConstitution which was to be drawn up and formally ratified within\r\nthe next few days.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon on the following day the _Ithuriel_, with Natas,\r\nNatasha, Arnold, and Tremayne on board, rose into the air from the\r\ngrounds of Buckingham Palace and headed away to the northward. The\r\ncontrol of affairs was left for the time being to a committee of the\r\nmembers of what had once been the Inner Circle of the Terrorists, and\r\nwhich was now the Supreme Council of the Federation.\r\n\r\nThis was under the joint presidency of Alexis Mazanoff and Nicholas\r\nRoburoff, who was exerting his great and well-proved administrative\r\nabilities to the utmost in order to atone for the fault which had led\r\nto the desertion of the _Lucifer_, and to amply justify the\r\nintercession of Natasha which had made it possible for him to be\r\npresent at the last triumph of the Federation and the accomplishment\r\nof the long and patient work of the Brotherhood. There was an immense\r\namount of work to be got through in the interval between the\r\npronouncement of the judgment of Natas on the Tsar and his Ministers\r\nand the execution of the sentence. After twenty-four hours in Newgate\r\nthey were transferred to Wormwood Scrubs Prison, and there, under a\r\nguard of Federation soldiers, who never left them for a moment day or\r\nnight, they awaited the hour of their departure to Siberia.\r\n\r\nCommunication with all parts of the Continent and America was rapidly\r\nrestored. The garrisons of the League were withdrawn from the\r\nconquered cities, gave up their arms at the depots of their\r\nrespective regiments, and returned to their homes. The French and\r\nItalian troops round London were disarmed and taken to France in the\r\nFederation fleet of transports. Meanwhile three air-ships were placed\r\ntemporarily at the disposal of the Emperor of Austria, the Kaiser,\r\nand the King of Italy, to convey them to their capitals, and furnish\r\nthem with the means of speedy transit about their dominions, and to\r\nand from London during the drawing up of the new European\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nA fleet of four air-ships and fifteen aerostats was also despatched\r\nto the Russian capital, and compelled the immediate surrender of the\r\nmembers of the Imperial family and the Ministers of the Government,\r\nand the instant disarmament of all troops on Russian soil, under pain\r\nof immediate destruction of St. Petersburg and Moscow, and invasion\r\nand conquest of the country by the Federation armies. The Council of\r\nState and the Ruling Senate were then dissolved, and the Executive\r\npassed automatically into the hands of the controllers of the\r\nFederation. Resistance was, of course, out of the question, and as\r\nsoon as it was once known for certain that the Tsar had been taken\r\nprisoner and his army annihilated, no one thought seriously of it, as\r\nit would have been utterly impossible to have defended even Russia\r\nagainst the overwhelming forces of the Federation and the British\r\nEmpire, assisted by the two aërial fleets.\r\n\r\nThe _Ithuriel_, after a flight of a little more than an hour, stopped\r\nand descended to the earth on the broad, sloping, and now\r\nsnow-covered lawn in front of Alanmere Castle. Lord Marazion and his\r\ndaughter, who, as it is almost needless to say, had been kept well\r\ninformed of the course of events since the Federation forces landed\r\nin England, had also been warned by telegraph of the coming of their\r\naërial visitors, and before the _Ithuriel_ had touched the earth, the\r\nnew mistress of Alanmere had descended the steps of the terrace that\r\nran the whole length of the Castle front to welcome its lord and hers\r\nback to his own again.\r\n\r\nThen there were greetings of lovers and friends, well known to each\r\nother by public report and familiar description, yet never seen in\r\nthe flesh till now, and of others long parted by distance and by\r\nmisconception of aims and motives. But however pleasing it might be\r\nto dwell at length upon the details of such a meeting, and its\r\ndelightful contrast to the horrors of unsparing war and merciless\r\ndestruction, there is now no space to do so, for the original limits\r\nof this history of the near future have already been reached and\r\noverpassed, and it is time to make ready for the curtain to descend\r\nupon the last scenes of the world-drama of the Year of Wonders--1904.\r\n\r\nTremayne was the first to alight, and he was followed by Natasha and\r\nArnold at a respectful distance, which they kept until the first\r\ngreeting between the two long and strangely-parted lovers was over.\r\nWhen at length Lady Muriel got out of the arms of her future lord,\r\nshe at once ran to Natasha with both her hands outstretched, a very\r\npicture of grace and health and blushing loveliness.\r\n\r\nShe was Natasha's other self, saving only for the incomparable\r\nbrilliance of colouring and contrast which the daughter of Natas\r\nderived from her union of Eastern and Western blood. Yet no fairer\r\ntype of purely English beauty than Muriel Penarth could have been\r\nfound between the Border and the Land's End, and what she lacked of\r\nNatasha's half Oriental brilliance and fire she atoned for by an\r\nadded measure of that indescribable blend of dignity and gentleness\r\nwhich makes the English gentlewoman perhaps the most truly lovable of\r\nall women on earth.\r\n\r\n\"I could not have believed that the world held two such lovely\r\nwomen,\" said Arnold to Tremayne, as the two girls met and embraced.\r\n\"How marvellously alike they are, too! They might be sisters. Surely\r\nthey must be some relation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am sure they are,\" replied Tremayne; \"such a resemblance\r\ncannot be accidental. I remember in that queer double life of mine,\r\nwhen I was your unconscious rival, I used to interchange them until\r\nthey almost seemed to be the same identity to me. There is some\r\nlittle mystery behind the likeness which we shall have cleared up\r\nbefore very long now. Natas told me to take Lord Marazion to him in\r\nthe saloon, and said he would not enter the Castle till he had spoken\r\nwith him alone. There he is at the door! You go and make Muriel's\r\nacquaintance, and I will take him on board at once.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Tremayne ran up the terrace steps, shook hands heartily\r\nwith the old nobleman, and then came down with him towards the\r\nair-ship. As they met Lady Muriel coming up with Arnold on one side\r\nof her and Natasha on the other, Lord Marazion stopped suddenly with\r\nan exclamation of wonder. He took his arm out of Tremayne's, strode\r\nrapidly to Natasha, and, before his daughter could say a word of\r\nintroduction, put his hands on her shoulders, and looked into her\r\nlovely upturned face through a sudden mist of tears that rose\r\nunbidden to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It is a miracle!\" he said, in a low voice that trembled with\r\nemotion. \"If you are the daughter of Natas, there is no need to tell\r\nme who he is, for you are Sylvia Penarth's daughter too. Is not that\r\nso, Sylvia di Murska--for I know you bear your mother's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I bear her name--and my father's. He is waiting for you in the\r\nair-ship, and he has much to say to you. You will bring him back to\r\nthe Castle with you, will you not?\"\r\n\r\nNatasha spoke with a seriousness that had more weight than her words,\r\nbut Lord Marazion understood her meaning. He stooped down and kissed\r\nher on the brow, saying--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; the past is the past. I will go to him, and you shall see\r\nus come back together.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so we are cousins!\" exclaimed Lady Muriel, slipping her arm\r\nround Natasha's waist as she spoke. \"I was sure we must be some\r\nrelation to each other; for, though I am not so beautiful\"--\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense, or I shall call you 'Your Ladyship' for the\r\nrest of the day. Yes, of course we are alike, since our mothers were\r\ntwin-sisters, and the very image of each other, according to their\r\nportraits.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the girls were talking of their new-found relationship, Arnold\r\nhad dropped behind to wait for Tremayne, who, after he had taken Lord\r\nMarazion into the saloon of the _Ithuriel_, had left him with Natas\r\nand returned to the Castle alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE MASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, when the lamps were lit and the curtains drawn in the\r\nlibrary at Alanmere, in the same room in which Tremayne had seen the\r\nVision of Armageddon, Natas told the story of Israel di Murska, the\r\nJewish Hungarian merchant, and of Sylvia Penarth, the beautiful\r\nEnglish wife whom he had loved better than his own faith and people,\r\nand how she had been taken from him to suffer a fate which had now\r\nbeen avenged as no human wrongs had ever been before.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five years ago,\" he began, gazing dreamily into the great\r\nfire of pine-logs, round the hearth of which he and his listeners\r\nwere sitting, \"I, who am now an almost helpless, half-mutilated\r\ncripple, was a strong, active man, in the early vigour of manhood,\r\nrich, respected, happy, and prosperous even beyond the average of\r\nearthly good fortune.\r\n\r\n\"I was a merchant in London, and I had inherited a large fortune from\r\nmy father, which I had more than doubled by successful trading. I was\r\nmarried to an English wife, a woman whose grace and beauty are\r\nfaithfully reflected in her daughter\"--\r\n\r\nAs Natas said this, the fierce light that had begun to shine in his\r\neyes softened, and the hard ring left his voice, and for a little\r\nspace he spoke in gentler tones, until sterner memories came and\r\nhardened them again.\r\n\r\n\"I will not deny that I bought her with my gold and fair promises of\r\na life of ease and luxury. But that is done every day in the world in\r\nwhich I then lived, and I only did as my Christian neighbours about\r\nme did. Yet I loved my beautiful Christian wife very dearly,--more\r\ndearly even than my people and my ancient faith,--or I should not\r\nhave married her.\r\n\r\n\"When Natasha was two years old the black pall of desolation fell\r\nsuddenly on our lives, and blasted our great happiness with a misery\r\nso utter and complete that we, who were wont to count ourselves among\r\nthe fortunate ones of the earth, were cast down so low that the\r\nbeggar at our doors might have looked down upon us.\r\n\r\n\"It was through no fault of mine or hers, nor through any\r\ncircumstance over which either of us had any control, that we fell\r\nfrom our serene estate. On the contrary, it was through a work of\r\npure mercy, intended for the relief of those of our people who were\r\ngroaning under the pitiless despotism of Russian officialism and\r\nsuperstition, that I fell, as so many thousands of my race have\r\nfallen, into that abyss of nameless misery and degradation that\r\nRussian hands have dug for the innocent in the ghastly solitudes of\r\nSiberia, and, without knowing it, dragged my sweet and loving wife\r\ninto it after me.\r\n\r\n\"It came about in this wise.\r\n\r\n\"I had a large business connection in Russia, and at a time when all\r\nEurope was ringing with the story of the persecution of the Russian\r\nJews, I, at the earnest request of a committee of the leading Jews in\r\nLondon, undertook a mission to St. Petersburg, to bring their\r\nsufferings, if possible, under the direct notice of the Tsar, and to\r\nobtain his consent to a scheme for the payment of a general\r\nindemnity, subscribed to by all the wealthy Jews of the world, which\r\nshould secure them against persecution and official tyranny until\r\nthey could be gradually and completely removed from Russia.\r\n\r\n\"I, of course, found myself thwarted at every turn by the heartless\r\nand corrupt officialism that stands between the Russian people and\r\nthe man whom they still regard as the vicegerent of God upon earth.\r\n\r\n\"Upon one pretext and another I was kept from the presence of the\r\nTsar for weeks, until he left his dominions on a visit to Denmark.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile I travelled about, and used my eyes as well as the\r\nofficials would permit me, to see whether the state of things was\r\nreally as bad as the accounts that had reached England had made it\r\nout to be.\r\n\r\n\"I saw enough to convince me that no human words could describe the\r\nawful sufferings of the sons and daughters of Israel in that hateful\r\nland of bondage.\r\n\r\n\"Neither their lives nor their honour, their homes nor their\r\nproperty, were safe from the malice and the lust and the rapacity of\r\nthe brutal ministers of Russian officialdom.\r\n\r\n\"I conversed with families from which fathers and mothers, sons and\r\ndaughters had been spirited away, either never to return, or to come\r\nback years afterwards broken in health, ruined and dishonoured, to\r\nthe poor wrecks of the homes that had once been peaceful, pure, and\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n\"I saw every injury, insult, and degradation heaped upon them that\r\npatient and long-suffering humanity could bear, until my soul\r\nsickened within me, and my spirit rose in revolt against the hateful\r\nand inhuman tyranny that treated my people like vermin and wild\r\nbeasts, for no offence save a difference in race and creed.\r\n\r\n\"At last the shame and horror of it all got the better of my\r\nprudence, and the righteous rage that burned within me spoke out\r\nthrough my pen and my lips.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote faithful accounts of all I had seen to the committee in\r\nEngland. They never reached their destination, for I was already a\r\nmarked man, and my letters were stopped and opened by the police.\r\n\r\n\"At last I one day attended a court of law, and heard one of those\r\ntravesties of justice which the Russian officials call a trial for\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\n\"There was not one tittle of anything that would have been called\r\nevidence, or that would not have been discredited and laughed out of\r\ncourt in any other country in Europe; yet two of the five prisoners,\r\na man and a woman, were sentenced to death, and the other three, two\r\nyoung students and a girl who was to have been the bride of one of\r\nthem in a few weeks' time, were doomed to five years in the mines of\r\nKara, and after that, if they survived it, to ten years' exile in\r\nSakhalin.\r\n\r\n\"So awful and so hideous did the appalling injustice seem to me,\r\naccustomed as I was to the open fairness of the English criminal\r\ncourts, that, overcome with rage and horror, I rose to my feet as the\r\njudge pronounced the frightful sentence, and poured forth a flood of\r\npassionate denunciations and wild appeals to the justice of humanity\r\nto revoke the doom of the innocent.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I was hustled out of the court and flung into the street\r\nby the police attendants, and I groped my way back to my hotel with\r\neyes blinded with tears of rage and sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"That afternoon I was requested by the proprietor of the hotel to\r\nleave before nightfall. I expostulated in vain. He simply told me\r\nthat he dared not have in his house a man who had brought himself\r\ninto collision with the police, and that I must find other lodgings\r\nat once. This, however, I found to be no easy matter. Wherever I went\r\nI was met with cold looks, and was refused admittance.\r\n\r\n\"Lower and lower sank my heart within me at each refusal, and the\r\nterrible conviction forced itself upon me that I was a marked man\r\namidst all-powerful and unscrupulous enemies whom no Russian dare\r\noffend. I was a Jew and an outcast, and there was nothing left for me\r\nbut to seek for refuge such as I could get among my own persecuted\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"Far on into the night I found one, a modest lodging, in which I\r\nhoped I could remain for a day or two while waiting for my passport,\r\nand making the necessary preparations to return to England and shake\r\nthe mire of Russia off my feet for ever. It would have been a\r\nthousand times better for me and my dear ones, and for those whose\r\nsympathy and kindness involved them in my ruin, if, instead of going\r\nto that ill-fated house, I had flung myself into the dark waters of\r\nthe Neva, and so ended my sorrows ere they had well begun.\r\n\r\n\"I applied for my passport the next day, and was informed that it\r\nwould not be ready for at least three days. The delay was, of course,\r\npurposely created, and before the time had expired a police visit was\r\npaid to the house in which I was lodging, and papers written in\r\ncypher were found within the lining of one of my hats.\r\n\r\n\"I was arrested, and a guard was placed over the house. Without any\r\nfurther ceremony I was thrown into a cell in the fortress of Peter\r\nand Paul to await the translation of the cypher. Three days later I\r\nwas taken before the chief of police, and accused of having in my\r\npossession papers proving that I was an emissary from the Nihilist\r\nheadquarters in London.\r\n\r\n\"I was told that my conduct had been so suspicious and of late so\r\ndisorderly, that I had been closely watched during my stay in St.\r\nPetersburg, with the result that conclusive evidence of treason had\r\nbeen found against me.\r\n\r\n\"As I was known to be wealthy, and to have powerful friends in\r\nEngland, the formality of a trial was dispensed with, and after\r\neating my heart out for a month in my cell in the fortress, I was\r\ntransferred to Moscow to join the next convict train for Siberia.\r\nArrived there, I for the first time learned my sentence--ten years in\r\nthe mines, and then ten in Sakhalin.\r\n\r\n\"Thus was I doomed by the trick of some police spy to pass what bade\r\nfair to be the remainder of a life that had been so bright and full\r\nof fair promise in hopeless exile, torment, and degradation--and all\r\nbecause I protested against injustice and made myself obnoxious to\r\nthe Russian police.\r\n\r\n\"As the chain-gang that I was attached to left Moscow, I found to my\r\nintense grief that the good Jew and his wife who had given me shelter\r\nwere also members of it. They had been convicted of 'harbouring a\r\npolitical conspirator,' and sentenced to five years' hard labour, and\r\nthen exile for life, as 'politicals,' which, as you no doubt know,\r\nmeant that, if they survived the first part of their sentence, they\r\nwould be allowed to settle in an allotted part of Southern Siberia,\r\nfree in everything but permission to leave the country.\r\n\r\n\"Were I to talk till this time to-morrow I could not properly\r\ndescribe to you all the horrors of that awful journey along the Great\r\nSiberian road, from the Pillar of Farewells that marks the boundary\r\nbetween Europe and Asia across the frightful snowy wastes to Kara.\r\n\r\n\"The hideous story has been told again and again without avail to the\r\nChristian nations of Europe, and they have permitted that awful crime\r\nagainst humanity to be committed year after year without even a\r\nprotest, in obedience to the miserable principles that bade them to\r\nplace policy before religion and the etiquette of nations before the\r\neverlasting laws of God.\r\n\r\n\"After two years of heartbreaking toil at the mines my health utterly\r\nbroke down. One day I fell fainting under the lash of the brutal\r\noverseer, and as I lay on the ground he ran at me and kicked me twice\r\nwith his heavy iron-shod boots, once on the hip, breaking the bone,\r\nand once on the lower part of the spine, crushing the spinal cord,\r\nand paralysing my lower limbs for ever.\r\n\r\n\"As this did not rouse me from my fainting-fit, the heartless fiend\r\nsnatched a torch from the wall of the mine-gallery and thrust the\r\nburning end in my long thick beard, setting it on fire and scorching\r\nmy flesh horribly, as you can see. I was carried out of the mine and\r\ntaken to the convict hospital, where I lay for weeks between life and\r\ndeath, and only lived instead of died because of the quenchless\r\nspirit that was within me crying out for vengeance on my tormentors.\r\n\r\n\"When I came back to consciousness, the first thing I learnt was that\r\nI was free to return to England on condition that I did not stop on\r\nmy way through Russia.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, urged on by the tireless energy of my wife's anxious\r\nlove, had at last found out what had befallen me, and proceedings had\r\nbeen instituted to establish the innocence that had been betrayed by\r\na common and too well-known device used by the Russian police to\r\nsecure the conviction and removal of those who have become obnoxious\r\nto the bureaucracy.\r\n\r\n\"Whether my friends would ever have accomplished this of themselves\r\nis doubtful, but suddenly the evidence of a pope of the Orthodox\r\nChurch, to whom the spy who had put the forged letters in my hat had\r\nconfessed the crime on his deathbed, placed the matter in such a\r\nstrong clear light that not even the officialism of Russia could\r\ncloud it over. The case got to the ears of the Tsar, and an order was\r\ntelegraphed to the Governor of Kara to release me and send me back to\r\nSt. Petersburg on the conditions I have named.\r\n\r\n\"Think of the mockery of such a pardon as that! By the unlawful\r\nbrutality of an official, who was not even reprimanded for what he\r\nhad done, I was maimed, crippled, and disfigured for life, and now I\r\nwas free to return to the land I had left on an errand of mercy,\r\nwhich tyranny and corruption had wilfully misconstrued into a mission\r\nof crime, and punished with the ruin of a once happy and useful life.\r\nThat was bad enough, but worse was to come before the cup of my\r\nmiseries should be full.\"\r\n\r\nNatas was silent for a moment, and as he gazed into the fire the\r\nspasm of a great agony passed over his face, and two great tears\r\nwelled up in his eyes and overflowed and ran down his cheeks on to\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\n\"On receiving the order the governor telegraphed back that I was sick\r\nalmost to death, and not able to bear the fatigue of the long,\r\ntoilsome journey, and asked for further orders. As soon as this news\r\nreached my devoted wife she at once set out, in spite of all the\r\nentreaties of her friends and advisers, to cross the wastes of\r\nSiberia, and take her place at my bedside.\r\n\r\n\"It was winter time, and from Ekaterinenburg, where the rail ended in\r\nthose days, the journey would have to be performed by sledge. She,\r\ntherefore, took with her only one servant and a courier, that she\r\nmight travel as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\n\"She reached Tiumen, and there all trace was lost of her and her\r\nattendants. She vanished into that great white wilderness of ice and\r\nsnow as utterly as though the grave had closed upon her. I knew\r\nnothing of her journey until I reached St. Petersburg many months\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\"All that money could do was done to trace her, but all to no avail.\r\nThe only official news that ever came back out of that dark world of\r\ndeath and misery was that she had started from one of the\r\npost-stations a few hours before a great snow-storm had come on, that\r\nshe had never reached the next station--and after that all was\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\n\"Five years passed. I had returned to find my little daughter well\r\nand blooming into youthful beauty, and my affairs prospering in\r\nskilful and honest hands. I was richer in wealth than I had ever\r\nbeen, and in happiness poorer than a beggar, while the shadow of that\r\nawful uncertainty hung over me.\r\n\r\n\"I could not believe the official story, for the search along the\r\nSiberian road had been too complete not to have revealed evidences of\r\nthe catastrophe of which it told when the snows melted, and none such\r\nwere ever found.\r\n\r\n\"At length one night, just as I was going to bed, I was told that a\r\nman who would not give his name insisted on seeing me on business\r\nthat he would tell no one but myself. All that he would say was that\r\nhe came from Russia. That was enough. I ordered him to be admitted.\r\n\r\n\"He was a stranger, ragged and careworn, and his face was stamped\r\nwith the look of sullen, unspeakable misery that men's faces only\r\nwear in one part of the world.\r\n\r\n\"'You are from Siberia,' I said, stretching out my hand to him.\r\n'Welcome, fellow-sufferer! Have you news for me?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, I am from Siberia,' he replied, taking my hand; 'an escaped\r\nNihilist convict from the mines. I have been four years getting from\r\nKara to London, else you should have had my news sooner. I fear it is\r\nsad enough, but what else could you expect from the Russian\r\nprison-land? Here it is.'\r\n\r\n\"As he spoke, he gave me an envelope, soiled and stained with long\r\ntravel, and my heart stood still as I recognised in the blurred\r\naddress the handwriting of my long-lost wife.\r\n\r\n\"With trembling fingers I opened it, and through my tears I read a\r\nletter that my dear one had written to me on her deathbed four years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"It has lain next my heart ever since, and every word is burnt into\r\nmy brain, to stand there against the day of vengeance. But I have\r\nnever told their full tale of shame and woe to mortal ears, nor ever\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\"Let it suffice to say that my wife was beautiful with a beauty that\r\nis rare among the daughters of men; that a woman's honour is held as\r\ncheaply in the wildernesses of Siberia as is the life of a man who is\r\na convict.\r\n\r\n\"The official story of her death was false--false as are all the ten\r\nthousand other lies that have come out of that abode of oppression\r\nand misery, and she whom I mourned would have been well-favoured of\r\nheaven if she had died in the snowdrifts, as they said she did,\r\nrather than in the shame and misery to which her brutal destroyer\r\nbrought her.\r\n\r\n\"He was an official of high rank, and he had had the power to cover\r\nhis crime from the knowledge of his superiors in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\"If it was ever known, it was hushed up for fear of the trouble that\r\nit would have brought to his masters; but two years later he visited\r\nParis, and was found one morning in bed with a dagger in his black\r\nheart, and across his face the mark that told that he had died by\r\norder of the Nihilist Executive.\r\n\r\n\"When I read those awful tidings from the grave, sorrow became\r\nquenchless rage, and despair was swallowed up in revenge. I joined\r\nthe Brotherhood, and thenceforth placed a great portion of my wealth\r\nat their disposal. I rose in their councils till I commanded their\r\nwhole organisation. No brain was so subtle as mine in planning\r\nschemes of revenge upon the oppressor, or of relief for the victims\r\nof his tyranny.\r\n\r\n\"In a word, I became the brain of the Brotherhood which men used to\r\ncall Nihilists, and then I organised another Society behind and above\r\nthis which the world has known as the Terror, and which the great\r\nones of the earth have for years dreaded as the most potent force\r\nthat ever was arrayed against the enemies of humanity. Of this force\r\nI have been the controlling brain and the directing will. It was my\r\ncreature, and it has obeyed me blindly; but ever since that fatal day\r\nin the mine at Kara I have been physically helpless, and therefore\r\nobliged to trust to others the execution of the plans that I\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\n\"It was for this reason that I had need of you, Alan Tremayne, and\r\nthis is why I chose you after I had watched you for years unseen as\r\nyou grew from youth to manhood, the embodiment of all that has made\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon the dominant factor in the development of present-day\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\"I have employed a power which, as I firmly believe, was given to me\r\nwhen eternal justice made me the instrument of its vengeance upon a\r\ngeneration that had forgotten alike its God and its brother, to bend\r\nyour will unconsciously to mine, and to compel you to do my bidding.\r\nHow far I was justified in that let the result show.\r\n\r\n\"It was once my intention to have bound you still closer to the\r\nBrotherhood by giving Natasha to you in marriage while you were yet\r\nunder the spell of my will; but the Master of Destiny willed it\r\notherwise, and I was saved from doing a great wrong, for the\r\nintention to do which I have done my best to atone.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment and looked across the fireplace at Arnold and\r\nNatasha, who were sitting together on a big, low lounge that had been\r\ndrawn up to the fire. Natasha raised her eyes for a moment and then\r\ndropped them. She knew what was coming, and a bright red flush rose\r\nup from her white throat to the roots of her dusky, lustrous hair.\r\n\r\n\"Richard Arnold, in the first communication I ever had with you, I\r\ntold you that if you used the powers you held in your hand well and\r\nwisely, you should, in the fulness of time, attain to your heart's\r\ndesire. You have proved your faith and obedience in the hour of\r\ntrial, and your strength and discretion in the day of battle. Now it\r\nis yours to ask and to have.\"\r\n\r\nFor all answer Arnold put out his hand and took hold of Natasha's,\r\nand said quietly but clearly--\r\n\r\n\"Give me this!\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it!\" said Natas. \"What you have worthily won you will worthily\r\nwear. May your days be long and peaceful in the world to which you\r\nhave given peace!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that three days later, in the little private\r\nchapel of Alanmere Castle, the two men who held the destinies of the\r\nworld in their hands, took to wife the two fairest women who ever\r\ngave their loveliness to be the crown of strength and the reward of\r\nloyal love.\r\n\r\nFor a week the Lord of Alanmere kept open house and royal state, as\r\nhis ancestors had done five hundred years before him. The\r\nconventional absurdity of the honeymoon was ignored, as such brides\r\nand bridegrooms might have been expected to ignore it. Arnold and\r\nNatasha took possession of a splendid suite of rooms in the eastern\r\nwing of the Castle, and the two new-wedded couples passed the first\r\ndays of their new happiness under one roof without the slightest\r\nconstraint; for the Castle was vast enough for solitude when they\r\ndesired it, and yet the solitude was not isolation or self-centred\r\nseclusion.\r\n\r\nTremayne's private wire kept them hourly informed of what was going\r\non in London, and when necessary the _Ithuriel_ was ready to traverse\r\nthe space between Alanmere and the capital in an hour, as it did more\r\nthan once to the great delight and wonderment of Tremayne's bride, to\r\nwhom the marvellous vessel seemed a miracle of something more than\r\nmerely human skill and genius.\r\n\r\nSo the days passed swiftly and happily until the Christmas bells of\r\n1904 rang out over the length and breadth of Christendom, for the\r\nfirst time proclaiming in very truth and fact, so far as the Western\r\nworld was concerned, \"Peace on earth, Goodwill to Man.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Into the vast, white, silent wilderness, out of which\r\nnone save the guards were destined ever to emerge again.\"\r\n\r\n_See page 385._]\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January a swift warship, attended by two dynamite\r\ncruisers, left Portsmouth, bound for Odessa. She had on board the\r\nlast of the Tsars of Russia, and those of his generals and Ministers\r\nwho had been taken prisoners with him on Muswell Hill. A thousand\r\nfeet overhead floated the _Ariel_, under the command of Alexis\r\nMazanoff.\r\n\r\nFrom Odessa the prisoners were taken by train to Moscow. There, in\r\nthe Central Convict Depot, they met their families and the officials\r\nwhose share in their crimes made it necessary to bring them under the\r\nsentence pronounced by Natas. They were chained together in squads,\r\nTsar and prince, noble and official, exactly as their own countless\r\nvictims had been in the past, and so they were taken with their wives\r\nand children by train to Ekaterinenburg.\r\n\r\nAlthough the railway extended as far as Tomsk, Mazanoff made them\r\ndisembark here, and marched them by the Great Siberian road to the\r\nPillar of Farewells on the Asiatic frontier. There, as so many\r\nthousands of heart-broken, despairing men and women had done before\r\nthem, they looked their last on Russian soil.\r\n\r\nFrom here they were marched on to the first Siberian _etapé_, one of\r\na long series of foul and pestilential prisons which were to be the\r\nonly halting-places on their long and awful journey. The next\r\nmorning, as soon as the chill grey light of the winter's dawn broke\r\nover the snow-covered plains, the men were formed up in line, with\r\nthe sleighs carrying the women and children in the rear. When all was\r\nready Mazanoff gave the word: \"Forward!\" the whips of the Cossacks\r\ncracked, and the mournful procession moved slowly onward into the\r\nvast, white, silent wilderness, out of which none save the guards\r\nwere destined ever to emerge again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\"AND ON EARTH PEACE!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter and summer of 1905 passed in unbroken tranquillity all\r\nover Europe and the English-speaking world. The nations, at last\r\nutterly sickened of bloodshed by the brief but awful experience of\r\nthe last six months of 1904, earnestly and gladly accepted the new\r\norder of things. From first to last of the war the slaughter had\r\naveraged more than a million of fighting men a month, and fully five\r\nmillions of non-combatants, men, women, and children, had fallen\r\nvictims to famine and disease, or had been killed during the\r\nwholesale destruction of fortified towns by the war-balloons of the\r\nLeague. At the lowest calculation the invasion of England had cost\r\nfour million lives.\r\n\r\nIt was an awful butcher's bill, and when the peoples of Europe awoke\r\nfrom the delirium of war to look back upon the frightful carnival of\r\ndeath and destruction, and realise that all this desolation and ruin\r\nhad come to pass in little more than seven months, so deep a horror\r\nof war and all its abominations possessed them that they hailed with\r\ndelight the safeguards provided against it by the new European\r\nConstitution which was made public at the end of March.\r\n\r\nIt was a singularly short and simple document considering the immense\r\nchanges which it introduced. It contained only five clauses. Of these\r\nthe first proclaimed the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon Federation in\r\nall matters of international policy, and set forth the penalties to\r\nbe incurred by any State that made war upon another.\r\n\r\nThe second constituted an International Board of Arbitration and\r\nControl, composed of all the Sovereigns of Europe and their Prime\r\nMinisters for the time being, with the new President of the United\r\nStates, the Governor-General of Canada, and the President of the now\r\nfederated Australasian Colonies. This Board was to meet in sections\r\nevery year in the various capitals of Europe, and collectively every\r\nfive years in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and New York in\r\nrotation. There was no appeal from its decision save to the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Federation, and this appeal could only be made with\r\nthe consent of the President of that Council, given after the facts\r\nof the matter in dispute had been laid before him in writing.\r\n\r\nThe third clause dealt with the rearrangement of the European\r\nfrontiers. The Rhine from Karlsruhe to Basle was made the political\r\nas well as the natural boundary between France and Germany. The\r\nancient kingdom of Poland was restored, with the frontiers it had\r\npossessed before the First Partition in 1773, and a descendant of\r\nKosciusko, elected by the votes of the adult citizens of the\r\nreconstituted kingdom, was placed upon the throne. Turkey in Europe\r\nceased to exist as a political power. Constantinople was garrisoned\r\nby British and Federation troops, and the country was administered\r\nfor the time being by a Provisional Government under the presidency\r\nof Lord Cromer, who was responsible only to the Supreme Council. The\r\nother States were left undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and fifth clauses dealt with land, property, and law. All\r\ntenures of land existing before the war were cancelled at a stroke,\r\nand the soil of each country was declared to be the sole and\r\ninalienable property of the State. No occupiers were disturbed who\r\nwere turning the land to profitable account, or who were making use\r\nof a reasonable area as a residential estate; but the great\r\nlandowners in the country and the ground landlords in the towns\r\nceased to exist as such, and all private incomes derived from the\r\nrent of land were declared illegal and so forfeited.\r\n\r\nAll incomes unearned by productive work of hand or brain were\r\nsubjected to a progressive tax, which reached fifty per cent. when\r\nthe income amounted to £10,000 a year. It is almost needless to say\r\nthat these clauses raised a tremendous outcry among the limited\r\nclasses they affected; but the only reply made to it by the President\r\nof the Supreme Council was \"that honestly earned incomes paid no tax,\r\nand that the idle and useless classes ought to be thankful to be\r\npermitted to exist at any price. The alternative of the tax would be\r\ncompulsory labour paid for at its actual value by the State.\" Without\r\none exception the grumblers preferred to pay the tax.\r\n\r\nAll rents, revised according to the actual value of the produce or\r\nproperty, were to be paid direct to the State. As long as he paid\r\nthis rent-tax no man could be disturbed in the possession of his\r\nholding. If he did not pay it the non-payment was to be held as\r\npresumptive evidence that he was not making a proper use of it, and\r\nhe was to receive a year's notice to quit; but if at the end of that\r\ntime he had amended his ways the notice was to be revoked.\r\n\r\nIn all countries the Civil and Criminal Codes of Law were to be\r\namalgamated and simplified by a committee of judges appointed\r\ndirectly by the Parliament with the assent of the Sovereign. The\r\nfifth clause of the Constitution plainly stated that no man was to be\r\nexpected to obey a law that he could not understand, and that the\r\nSupreme Council would uphold no law which was so complicated that it\r\nneeded a legal expert to explain it.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to say that this clause swept away at a blow\r\nthat pernicious class of hired advocates who had for ages grown rich\r\non the weakness and the dishonesty of their fellow-men. In after\r\nyears it was found that the abolition of the professional lawyer had\r\nfurthered the cause of peace and progress quite as efficiently as the\r\nprohibition of standing armies had done.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the war the aërial fleet was increased to\r\ntwenty-five vessels exclusive of the flagship. The number of\r\nwar-balloons was raised to fifty, and three millions of Federation\r\nsoldiers were held ready for active service until the conclusion of\r\nthe war in the East between the Moslems and Buddhists. By November\r\nthe Moslems were victors all along the line, and during the last week\r\nof that month the last battle between Christian and Moslem was fought\r\non the Southern shore of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nAll communications with the Asiatic and African shores of the\r\nMediterranean were cut as soon as it became certain that Sultan\r\nMohammed Reshad, at the head of a million and a half of victorious\r\nMoslems, and supported by Prince Abbas of Egypt at the head of seven\r\nhundred thousand more, was marching to the reconquest of Turkey. The\r\nmost elaborate precautions were taken to prevent any detailed\r\ninformation as to the true state of things in Europe reaching the\r\nSultan, as Tremayne and Arnold had come to the conclusion that it\r\nwould be better, if he persisted in courting inevitable defeat, that\r\nit should fall upon him with crushing force and stupefying\r\nsuddenness, so that he might be the more inclined to listen to reason\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean was patrolled from end to end by air-ships and\r\ndynamite cruisers, and aërial scouts marked every movement of the\r\nvictorious Sultan until it became absolutely certain that his\r\nobjective point was Scutari. Meanwhile, two millions of men had been\r\nconcentrated between Galata and Constantinople, while another million\r\noccupied the northern shore of the Dardanelles. An immense force of\r\nwarships and dynamite cruisers swarmed between Gallipoli and the\r\nGolden Horn. Twenty air-ships and forty-five war-balloons lay outside\r\nConstantinople, ready to take the air at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nThe conqueror of Northern Africa and Southern Asia had only a very\r\ngeneral idea as to what had really happened in Europe. His march of\r\nconquest had not been interrupted by any European expedition. The\r\nMoslems of India had exterminated the British garrisons, and there\r\nhad been no attempt at retaliation or vengeance, as there had been in\r\nthe days of the Mutiny. England, he knew, had been invaded, but\r\naccording to the reports which had reached him, none of the invaders\r\nhad ever got out of the island alive, and then the English had come\r\nout and conquered Europe. Of the wonderful doings of the aërial\r\nfleets only the vaguest rumours had come to his ears, and these had\r\nbeen so exaggerated and distorted, that he had but a very confused\r\nidea of the real state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Moslem forces were permitted to advance without the slightest\r\nmolestation to Scutari and Lamsaki, and on the evening of the 28th of\r\nNovember the Sultan took up his quarters in Scutari. That night he\r\nreceived a letter from the President of the Federation, setting forth\r\nsuccinctly, and yet very clearly, what had actually taken place in\r\nEurope, and calling upon him to give his allegiance to the Supreme\r\nCouncil, as the other sovereigns had done, and to accept the\r\noverlordship of Northern Africa and Southern Asia in exchange for\r\nTurkey in Europe. The letter concluded by saying that the immediate\r\nresult of refusal to accept these terms would be the destruction of\r\nthe Moslem armies on the following day. Before midnight, Tremayne\r\nreceived the Sultan's reply. It ran thus--\r\n\r\n    In the name of the Most Merciful God.\r\n\r\n      From MOHAMMED RESHAD, Commander of the Faithful, to ALAN\r\n      TREMAYNE, Leader of the English.\r\n\r\n    I have come to retake the throne of my fathers, and I am not to\r\n    be turned back by vain and boastful threats. What I have won with\r\n    the sword I will keep with the sword, and I will own allegiance\r\n    to none save God and His holy Prophet who have given me the\r\n    victory. Give me back Stamboul and my ancient dominions, and we\r\n    will divide the world between us. If not we must fight. Let the\r\n    reply to this come before daybreak.\r\n\r\n      MOHAMMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo reply came back; but during the night the dynamite cruisers were\r\ndrawn up within half a mile of the Asiatic shore with their guns\r\npointing southward over Scutari, while other warships patrolled the\r\ncoast to detect and frustrate any attempt to transport guns or troops\r\nacross the narrow strip of water. With the first glimmer of light,\r\nthe two aërial fleets took the air, the war-balloons in a long line\r\nover the van of the Moslem army, and the air-ships spread out in a\r\nsemicircle to the southward. The hour of prayer was allowed to pass\r\nin peace, and then the work of death began. The war-balloons moved\r\nslowly forward in a straight line at an elevation of four thousand\r\nfeet, sweeping the Moslem host from van to rear with a ceaseless hail\r\nof melinite and cyanogen bombs. Great projectiles soared silently up\r\nfrom the water to the north, and where they fell buildings were torn\r\nto fragments, great holes were blasted into the earth, and every\r\nhuman being within the radius of the explosion was blown to pieces,\r\nor hurled stunned to the ground. But more mysterious and terrible\r\nthan all were the effects of the assault delivered by the air-ships,\r\nwhich divided into squadrons and swept hither and thither in wide\r\ncurves, with the sunlight shining on their silvery hulls and their\r\nlong slender guns, smokeless and flameless, hurling the most awful\r\nmissiles of all far and wide, over a scene of butchery and horror\r\nthat beggared all description.\r\n\r\nIn vain the gallant Moslems looked for enemies in the flesh to\r\nconfront them. None appeared save a few sentinels across the\r\nBosphorus. And still the work of slaughter went on, pitiless and\r\npassionless as the earthquake or the thunderstorm. Millions of shots\r\nwere fired into the air without result, and by the time the rain of\r\ndeath had been falling without intermission for two hours, an\r\nirresistible panic fell upon the Moslem soldiery. They had never met\r\nenemies like these before, and, brave as lions and yet simple as\r\nchildren, they looked upon them as something more than human, and\r\nwith one accord they flung away their weapons and raised their hands\r\nin supplication to the sky. Instantly the aërial bombardment ceased,\r\nand within an hour East and West had shaken hands, Sultan Mohammed\r\nhad accepted the terms of the Federation, and the long warfare of\r\nCross and Crescent had ceased, as men hoped, for ever.\r\n\r\nThen the proclamation was issued disbanding the armies of Britain and\r\nthe Federation and the forces of the Sultan. The warships steamed\r\naway westward on their last voyage to the South Atlantic, beneath\r\nwhose waves they were soon to sink with all their guns and armaments\r\nfor ever. The war-balloons were to be kept for purposes of\r\ntransportation of heavy articles to Aeria, while the fleet of\r\nair-ships was to remain the sole effective fighting force in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place in Europe, those who had been\r\nbanished as outcasts from the society of civilised men by the\r\nterrible justice of Natas had been plodding their weary way, in the\r\ntracks of the thousands they had themselves sent to a living grave,\r\nalong the Great Siberian Road to the hideous wilderness, in the midst\r\nof which lie the mines of Kara. From the Pillar of Farewells to\r\nTiumen, from thence to Tomsk,--where they met the first of the\r\nreleased political exiles returning in a joyous band to their beloved\r\nRussia,--and thence to Irkutsk, and then over the ice of Lake Baikal,\r\nand through the awful frozen desert of the Trans-Baikal Provinces,\r\nthey had been driven like cattle until the remnant that had survived\r\nthe horrors of the awful journey reached the desolate valley of the\r\nKara and were finally halted at the Lower Diggings.\r\n\r\nOf nearly three hundred strong and well-fed men who had said good-bye\r\nto liberty at the Pillar of Farewells, only a hundred and twenty\r\npallid and emaciated wretches stood shivering in their rags and\r\nchains when the muster was called on the morning after their arrival\r\nat Kara. Mazanoff and his escort had carried out their part of the\r\nsentence of Natas to the letter. The arctic blasts from the Tundras,\r\nthe forced march, the chain and the scourge had done their work, and\r\nmore than half the exile-convicts had found in nameless graves along\r\nthe road respite from the long horrors of the fate which awaited the\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nThe first name called in the last muster was Alexander Romanoff.\r\n\"Here,\" came in a deep hollow tone from the gaunt and ragged wreck of\r\nthe giant who twelve months before had been the stateliest figure in\r\nthe brilliant galaxy of European Royalty.\r\n\r\n\"Your sentence is hard labour in the mines for\"--The last word was\r\nnever spoken, for ere it was uttered the tall and still erect form of\r\nthe dethroned Autocrat suddenly shrank together, lurched forward, and\r\nfell with a choking gasp and a clash of chains upon the hard-trampled\r\nsnow. A stream of blood rushed from his white, half-open lips, and\r\nwhen they went to raise him he was dead.\r\n\r\nIf ever son of woman died of a broken heart it was Alexander\r\nRomanoff, last of the tyrants of Russia. Never had the avenging hand\r\nof Nemesis, though long-delayed, fallen with more precise and\r\nterrible justice. On the very spot on which thousands of his subjects\r\nand fellow-creatures, innocent of all crime save a desire for\r\nprogress, had worn out their lives in torturing toil to provide the\r\ngold that had gilded his luxury, he fell as the Idol fell of old in\r\nthe temple of Dagon.\r\n\r\nHe had seen the blasting of his highest hopes in the hour of their\r\napparent fruition. He had beheld the destruction of his army and the\r\nruin of his dynasty. He had seen kindred and friends and faithful\r\nservants sink under the nameless horrors of a fate he could do\r\nnothing to alleviate, and with the knowledge that nothing but death\r\ncould release them from it, and now at the last moment death had\r\nsnatched from him even the poor consolation of sharing the sufferings\r\nof those nearest and dearest to him on earth.\r\n\r\nThis happened on the 1st of December 1905, at nine o'clock in the\r\nmorning. At the same hour Arnold leapt the _Ithuriel_ over the Ridge,\r\npassed down the valley of Aeria like a flash of silver light, and\r\ndropped to earth on the shores of the lake. In the same grove of\r\npalms which had witnessed their despairing betrothal he found Natasha\r\nswinging in a hammock, with a black-eyed six-weeks'-old baby nestling\r\nin her bosom, and her own loveliness softened and etherealised by the\r\nsacred grace of motherhood.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, my lord!\" she said, with a bright flush of pleasure and the\r\nsweetest smile even he had ever seen transfiguring her beauty, as she\r\nstretched out her hand in welcome at his approach. \"Does the King\r\ncome in peace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Angel mine! the empire that you asked for is yours. There is\r\nnot a regiment of men under arms in all the civilised world. The last\r\nbattle has been fought and won, and so there is peace on earth at\r\nlast!\"\r\n\r\n  THE END\r\n\r\n  MORRISON AND GIBB PRINTERS, EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNow Ready, Third Edition.\r\n\r\n_308 pages, demy 8vo, cloth gilt, 6s._,\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAIN OF THE MARY ROSE.\r\n\r\n_A TALE OF TO-MORROW._\r\n\r\nBy W.
