(1.)—THE EUXINE AND THE MARYANDINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Euxine[1] Sea, which in former times had the name of Axenus,[2]\r\nfrom the savage and inhospitable character of the nations living on\r\nits borders, by a peculiar whim of nature, which is continually giving\r\nway before the greedy inroads of the sea, lies between Europe and\r\nAsia. It was not enough for the ocean to have surrounded the earth,\r\nand then deprived us of a considerable portion of it, thus rendering\r\nstill greater its uninhabitable proportion; it was not enough for it to\r\nhave forced a passage through the mountains, to have torn away Calpe\r\nfrom Africa, and to have swallowed up a much larger space than it left\r\nuntouched; it was not enough for it to have poured its tide into the\r\nPropontis through the Hellespont, after swallowing up still more of the\r\ndry land—for beyond the Bosporus, as well, it opens with its insatiate\r\nappetite upon another space of immense extent, until the Mæotian\r\nlakes[3] unite their ravening waters with it as it ranges far and wide.\r\n\r\nThat all this has taken place in spite, as it were, of the earth,\r\nis manifested by the existence of so many straits and such numbers\r\nof narrow passages formed against the will of nature—that of the\r\nHellespont,[4] being only eight hundred and seventy-five paces in\r\nwidth, while at the two Bospori[5] the passage across may be effected\r\nby oxen[6] swimming, a fact from which they have both derived their\r\nname. And then besides,[7] although they are thus severed, there\r\nare certain points on which these coasts stand in the relation of\r\nbrotherhood towards each other—the singing of birds and the barking\r\nof dogs on the one side can be heard on the other, and an intercourse\r\ncan be maintained between these two worlds by the medium even of the\r\nhuman voice,[8] if the winds should not happen to carry away the sound\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe length of the borders of the Euxine from the Bosporus to the Lake\r\nMæotis has been reckoned by some writers at fourteen hundred and\r\nthirty-eight miles; Eratosthenes, however, says that it is one hundred\r\nless. According to Agrippa, the distance from Chalcedon to the Phasis\r\nis one thousand miles, and from that river to the Cimmerian Bosporus\r\nthree hundred and sixty. We will here give in a general form the\r\ndistances as they have been ascertained in our own times; for our arms\r\nhave even penetrated to the very mouth of the Cimmerian Straits.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the mouth of the Bosporus we come to the river Rhebas,[9]\r\nby some writers called the Rhesus. We next come to Psillis,[10] the\r\nport of Calpas,[11] and the Sagaris,[12] a famous river, which rises\r\nin Phrygia and receives the waters of other rivers of vast magnitude,\r\namong which are the Tembrogius[13] and the Gallus,[14] the last of\r\nwhich is by many called the Sangarius. After leaving the Sagaris\r\nthe Gulf of the Mariandyni[15] begins, and we come to the town of\r\nHeraclea,[16] on the river Lycus;[17] this place is distant from the\r\nmouth of the Euxine two hundred miles. The sea-port of Acone[18] comes\r\nnext, which has a fearful notoriety for its aconite or wolf’s-bane,\r\na deadly poison, and then the cavern of Acherusia,[19] the rivers\r\nPædopides, Callichorus, and Sonautes, the town of Tium,[20] distant\r\nfrom Heraclea thirty-eight miles, and the river Billis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (2.)—PAPHLAGONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond this river begins the nation of Paphlagonia,[21] by some writers\r\ncalled Pylæmenia;[22] it is closed in behind by the country of Galatia.\r\nIn it are Mastya,[23] a town founded by the Milesians, and then\r\nCromna,[24] at which spot Cornelius Nepos also places the Heneti,[25]\r\nfrom whom he would have us believe that the Veneti of Italy, who\r\nhave a similar name, are descended. The city also of Sesamon, now\r\ncalled Amastris,[26] Mount Cytorus,[27] distant sixty-three miles\r\nfrom Tium, the towns of Cimolis[28] and Stephane,[29] and the river\r\nParthenius.[30] The promontory of Carambis,[31] which extends a great\r\ndistance into the sea, is distant from the mouth of the Euxine three\r\nhundred and twenty-five miles, or, according to some writers, three\r\nhundred and fifty, being the same distance from the Cimmerian Bosporus,\r\nor, as some persons think, only three hundred and twelve miles. There\r\nwas formerly also a town of the same name, and another near it called\r\nArmene; we now find there the colony of Sinope,[32] distant from Mount\r\nCytorus one hundred and sixty-four miles. We then come to the river\r\nEvarchus,[33] and after that a people of the Cappadocians, the towns\r\nof Gaziura[34] and Gazelum,[35] the river Halys,[36] which runs from\r\nthe foot of Mount Taurus through Cataonia and Cappadocia, the towns of\r\nGangre[37] and Carusa,[38] the free town of Amisus,[39] distant from\r\nSinope one hundred and thirty miles, and a gulf of the same name, of\r\nsuch vast extent[40] as to make Asia assume the form of a peninsula,\r\nthe isthmus of which is only some two hundred[41] miles in breadth,\r\nor a little more, across to the gulf of Issus in Cilicia. In all this\r\ndistrict there are, it is said, only three races that can rightly be\r\ntermed Greeks, the Dorians, the Ionians, and the Æolians, all the\r\nrest being of barbarian origin.[42] To Amisus was joined the town of\r\nEupatoria,[43] founded by Mithridates: after his defeat they were both\r\nincluded under the name of Pompeiopolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (3.)—CAPPADOCIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCappadocia[44] has in the interior Archelais,[45] a colony founded by\r\nClaudius Cæsar, and past which the river Halys flows; also the towns\r\nof Comana,[46] watered by the Sarus, Neocæsarea,[47] by the Lycus,[48]\r\nand Amasia,[49] in the region of Gazacene, washed by the Iris. In\r\nColopene it has Sebastia and Sebastopolis;[50] these are insignificant\r\nplaces, but still equal in importance to those just mentioned. In its\r\nremaining districts there is Melita,[51] founded by Semiramis, and\r\nnot far from the Euphrates, Diocæsarea,[52] Tyana,[53] Castabala,[54]\r\nMagnopolis,[55] Zela,[56] and at the foot of Mount Argæus[57] Mazaca,\r\nnow called Cæsarea.[58] That part of Cappadocia which lies stretched\r\nout before the Greater Armenia is called Melitene, before Commagene\r\nCataonia, before Phrygia Garsauritis, Sargarausene,[59] and Cammanene,\r\nbefore Galatia Morimene, where their territories are divided by the\r\nriver Cappadox,[60] from which this people have taken their name;\r\nthey were formerly known as the Leucosyri.[61] From Neocæsarea above\r\nmentioned, the lesser Armenia is separated by the river Lycus. In the\r\ninterior also there is the famous river Ceraunus,[62] and on the coast\r\nbeyond the town of Amisus, the town and river of Chadisia,[63] and the\r\ntown of Lycastum,[64] after which the region of Themiscyra[65] begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—THE REGION OF THEMISCYRA, AND THE NATIONS THEREIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river Iris brings down to the sea the waters of the Lycus. In\r\nthe interior is the city of Ziela,[66] famous for the defeat of\r\nTriarius[67] and the victory of C. Cæsar.[68] Upon the coast there\r\nis the river Thermodon, which rises at the fortified place called\r\nPhanarœa,[69] and flows past the foot of Mount Amazonius.[70] There\r\nwas formerly a town of the same name as the river, and five others\r\nin all, Amazonium, Themiscyra, Sotira, Amasia, and Comana,[71] now\r\nonly a Manteium. (4.) We find here the nations of the Genetæ,[72]\r\nthe Chalybes,[73] the town of Cotyorum,[74] the nations of the\r\nTibareni and the Mossyni, who make marks upon their bodies,[75] the\r\npeople called Macrocephali,[76] the town of Cerasus,[77] the port\r\nof Chordule, the nations called the Bechires[78] and the Buzeri, the\r\nriver Melas,[79] the people called the Macrones, and Sidene with its\r\nriver Sidenus,[80] by which the town of Polemonium[81] is washed, at\r\na distance from Amisus of one hundred and twenty miles. We next come\r\nto the rivers Iasonius[82] and Melanthius,[83] and, at a distance of\r\neighty miles from Amisus, the town of Pharnacea,[84] the fortress\r\nand river of Tripolis;[85] the fortress and river of Philocalia, the\r\nfortress of Liviopolis, but not upon a river, and, at a distance of\r\none hundred miles from Pharnacea, the free city of Trapezus,[86] shut\r\nin by a mountain of vast size. Beyond this town is the nation of the\r\nArmenochalybes[87] and the Greater Armenia, at a distance of thirty\r\nmiles. On the coast, before Trapezus, flows the river Pyxites, and\r\nbeyond it is the nation of the Sanni[88] Heniochi. Next comes the river\r\nAbsarus,[89] with a fortress of the same name at its mouth, distant\r\nfrom Trapezus one hundred and forty miles.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the mountains of this district is Iberia, while on\r\nthe coast are the Heniochi, the Ampreutæ,[90] the Lazi, the rivers\r\nAcampsis,[91] Isis,[92] Mogrus, and Bathys,[93] the nations of the\r\nColchi, the town of Matium,[94] the river Heracleum and the promontory\r\nof the same name,[95] and the Phasis,[96] the most celebrated river of\r\nPontus. This river rises among the Moschi, and is navigable for the\r\nlargest vessels a distance of thirty-eight miles and a half, and for\r\nsmall ones very much higher up; it is crossed by one hundred and twenty\r\nbridges. It formerly had many cities of note on its banks, the more\r\nfamous of which were Tyndaris, Circæum, Cygnus, and Phasis[97] at its\r\nmouth. But the most celebrated of them all was Æa, fifteen miles[98]\r\ndistant from the sea, where the Hippos and the Cyaneos,[99] rivers of\r\nvast size, flow into it from opposite directions. At the present day\r\nits only place of note is Surium, which derives its name from the\r\nriver which flows at that spot into the Phasis, and up to which place\r\nthe Phasis is navigable for large vessels, as we have already[100]\r\nmentioned. It receives also some other rivers, wonderful for their\r\nnumber and magnitude, and among them the Glaucus.[101] At the mouth\r\nof the Phasis, at a distance of seventy miles from Absarus, are some\r\nislands, which, however, have no name. After passing this, we come\r\nto another river, the Charieis,[102] and the nation of the Salæ, by\r\nthe ancients called Phthirophagi,[103] as also Suani.[104] The river\r\nChobus[105] flows from the Caucasus through the country of the Suani.\r\nThe river Rhoas comes next, then the region of Ecrectice, the rivers\r\nSingames,[106] Tarsuras,[107] Astelephus,[108] Chrysorrhoas, the\r\nnation of the Absilæ, the castle of Sebastopolis,[109] one hundred\r\nmiles distant from Phasis, the nation of the Sannigæ, the town of\r\nCygnus,[110] and the river and town of Penius.[111] We then come to the\r\ntribes of the Heniochi,[112] who are distinguished by numerous names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (5.)—THE REGION OF COLICA, THE NATIONS OF THE ACHÆI, AND OTHER\r\nNATIONS IN THE SAME PARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow this lies the region of Pontus known as Colica,[113] in\r\nwhich the mountain chain of Caucasus bends away towards the Riphæan\r\nmountains, as we have previously[114] mentioned; one side running down\r\ntowards the Euxine and the Lake Mæotis, the other towards the Caspian\r\nand the Hyrcanian sea. The remaining portion of these shores is peopled\r\nby savage nations, the Melanchlæni,[115] and the Coraxi, who formerly\r\ndwelt in Dioscurias,[116] near the river Anthemus, now deserted, but\r\nonce a famous city; so much so, indeed, that we learn from Timosthenes,\r\nthat three hundred nations, all of different languages, were in the\r\nhabit of resorting to it, and in later times we had there one hundred\r\nand thirty interpreters for the purpose of transacting business. There\r\nare some authors who are of opinion that this place was built by\r\nAmphitus and Telchius, the charioteers[117] of Castor and Pollux, from\r\nwhom it is generally understood that the nation of the Heniochi sprang.\r\nAfter passing Dioscurias we come to the town of Heracleium,[118]\r\nseventy miles distant from Sebastopolis, and then the Achæi,[119] the\r\nMardi,[120] and the Cercetæ,[121] and, behind them, the Cerri and the\r\nCephalotomi.[122] In the innermost part[123] of this district there\r\nwas Pityus,[124] a city of very considerable opulence, but destroyed\r\nby the Heniochi: behind it are the Epageritæ, a people of Sarmatian\r\norigin, dwelling upon the range of the Caucasus, and beyond them, the\r\nSauromatæ. It was with these people that Mithridates[125] took refuge\r\nin the reign of the Emperor Claudius: and from him we learn that the\r\nThalli[126] join up to them, a people who border on the eastern side\r\nupon the mouth[127] of the Caspian sea: he tells us also that at the\r\nreflux the channel is dry there. Upon the coast of the Euxine, near the\r\ncountry of the Cercetæ, is the river Icarusa,[128] with the town and\r\nriver of Hierus, distant from Heracleium one hundred and thirty-six\r\nmiles. Next to this, is the promontory of Cruni, after passing which,\r\nwe find the Toretæ upon a lofty ridge of mountains. The city of\r\nSindos[129] is distant from Hierus sixty-seven miles and a half; after\r\npassing which, we come to the river Setheries. (6.) From thence to the\r\nentrance of the Cimmerian Bosporus the distance is eighty-eight miles\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—THE CIMMERIAN BOSPORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe length of the peninsula[130] which projects between the Euxine\r\nand Lake Mæotis, is not more than sixty-seven miles and a half, and\r\nthe width across never less than two jugera:[131] it has the name of\r\nEion.[132] The shores of the Bosporus then take a curve both on the\r\nside of Europe and of Asia, thus forming the Mæotis. The towns at the\r\nentrance of the Bosporus are, first Hermonassa,[133] next Cepi,[134]\r\nfounded by the Milesians, and then Stratoclia and Phanagoria,[135] and\r\nthe almost deserted town of Apaturos,[136] and, at the extremity of the\r\nmouth, Cimmerium,[137] which was formerly called Cerberion. (7.) We\r\nthen come to Lake Mæotis, which has been already mentioned[138] in the\r\ndescription of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—LAKE MÆOTIS AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter passing Cimmerium, the coast[139] is inhabited by the Mæotici,\r\nthe Vali, the Serbi,[140] the Arrechi, the Zingi, and the Psessi. We\r\nthen come to the river Tanais,[141] which discharges itself into the\r\nsea by two mouths, and the banks of which are inhabited by the Sarmatæ,\r\nthe descendants of the Medi, it is said, a people divided into numerous\r\ntribes. The first of these are the Sauromatæ Gynæcocratumeni,[142]\r\nthe husbands of the Amazons. Next to them are the Ævazæ,[143] the\r\nCoitæ,[144] the Cicimeni, the Messeniani, the Costobocci, the Choatræ,\r\nthe Zigæ,[145] the Dandarii, the Thyssagetæ, and the Iyrcæ,[146] as\r\nfar as certain rugged deserts and densely wooded vallies, beyond\r\nwhich again are the Arimphæi,[147] who extend as far as the Riphæan\r\nMountains.[148] The Scythians call the river Tanais by the name of\r\nSilis, and the Mæotis the Temarunda, meaning the “mother of the sea.”\r\nThere is[149] a city also at the mouth of the Tanais. The neighbouring\r\ncountry was inhabited first by the Carians, then by the Clazomenii and\r\nMæones, and after them by the Panticapenses.[150]\r\n\r\nThere are some writers who state that there are the following nations\r\ndwelling around the Mæotis, as far as the Ceraunian mountains;[151]\r\nat a short distance from the shore, the Napitæ, and beyond them, the\r\nEssedones, who join up to the Colchians, and dwell upon the summits of\r\nthe mountains: after these again, the Camacæ, the Orani, the Autacæ,\r\nthe Mazacasi, the Cantiocæ, the Agamathæ, the Pici, the Rimosoli, the\r\nAcascomarci, and, upon the ridges of the Caucasus, the Itacalæ, the\r\nImadochi, the Rami, the Anclacæ, the Tydii, the Carastasei, and the\r\nAnthiandæ. The river Lagoüs runs from the Cathæan[152] mountains, and\r\ninto it flows the Opharus. Upon it are the tribes of the Cauthadæ, and\r\nthe Opharitæ. Next to these are the rivers Menotharus and Imityes,\r\nwhich flow from the Cissian mountains, among the peoples called the\r\nAcdei, the Carnæ, the Oscardei, the Accisi, the Gabri, the Gogari, and,\r\naround the source of the Imityes, the Imityi, and the Apatræi. Some\r\nwriters say that the Auchetæ, the Athernei, and the Asampatæ, Scythian\r\ntribes, have made inroads upon this territory, and have destroyed the\r\nTanaitæ and the Inapæi to a man. Others again represent the Ocharius\r\nas running through the Cantici and the Sapæi, and the Tanais as\r\npassing through the territories of the Sarcharcei, the Herticei, the\r\nSpondolici, the Synhietæ, the Anasi, the Issi, the Catetæ, the Tagoræ,\r\nthe Caroni, the Neripi, the Agandei, the Mandarei, the Satarchei, and\r\nthe Spalei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (8.)—THE SITUATION OF CAPPADOCIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now gone over the coast which borders upon the Inner[153] Sea,\r\nand have enumerated the various nations that dwell thereon; let us now\r\nturn to those vast tracts of land which lie further in the interior.\r\nI do not deny that in my description I shall differ very materially\r\nfrom the ancient writers, but still it is one that has been compiled\r\nwith the most anxious research, from a full examination into the events\r\nwhich have transpired of late in these countries under the command of\r\nDomitius Corbulo,[154] and from information received either from kings\r\nwho have been sent thence to Rome, as suppliants for our mercy, or else\r\nthe sons of kings who have visited us in the character of hostages.\r\n\r\nWe will begin then with the nation of the Cappadocians.\r\n\r\nOf all the countries of Pontus, this[155] extends the greatest distance\r\ninto the interior.[156] On the left[157] it leaves behind the Lesser\r\nand the Greater Armenia, as well as Commagene, and on the right all the\r\nnations of the province of Asia which we have previously described.\r\nSpreading over numerous peoples, it rises rapidly in elevation in an\r\neasterly direction towards the range of Taurus. Then passing Lycaonia,\r\nPisidia, and Cilicia, it advances above the district of Antiochia, the\r\nportion of it known as Cataonia extending as far as Cyrrhestica, which\r\nforms part of that district. The length of Asia[158] here is twelve\r\nhundred and fifty miles, its breadth six hundred and forty.[159]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (9.)—THE LESSER AND THE GREATER ARMENIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreater Armenia,[160] beginning at the mountains known as the\r\nParyadres,[161] is separated, as we have already stated,[162] from\r\nCappadocia by the river Euphrates, and, where that river turns off[163]\r\nin its course, from Mesopotamia, by the no less famous river Tigris.\r\nBoth of these rivers take their rise in Armenia, which also forms the\r\ncommencement of Mesopotamia, a tract of country which lies between\r\nthese streams; the intervening space between them being occupied by the\r\nArabian Orei.[164] It thus extends its frontier as far as Adiabene, at\r\nwhich point it is stopped short by a chain of mountains which takes a\r\ncross direction; whereupon the province extends in width to the left,\r\ncrossing the course of the Araxes,[165] as far as the river Cyrus;[166]\r\nwhile in length it reaches as far as the Lesser Armenia,[167] from\r\nwhich it is separated by the river Absarus, which flows into the\r\nEuxine, and by the mountains known as the Paryadres, in which the\r\nAbsarus takes its rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—THE RIVERS CYRUS AND ARAXES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river Cyrus[168] takes its rise in the mountains of the Heniochi,\r\nby some writers called the Coraxici; the Araxes rises in the same\r\nmountains as the river Euphrates, at a distance from it of six miles\r\nonly;[169] and after being increased by the waters of the Usis, falls\r\nitself, as many authors have supposed, into the Cyrus, by which it is\r\ncarried into the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nThe more famous towns in Lesser Armenia are Cæsarea,[170] Aza,[171]\r\nand Nicopolis;[172] in the Greater Arsamosata,[173] which lies near\r\nthe Euphrates, Carcathiocerta[174] upon the Tigris, Tigranocerta[175]\r\nwhich stands on an elevated site, and, on a plain adjoining the river\r\nAraxes, Artaxata.[176] According to Aufidius, the circumference of\r\nthe whole of Armenia is five thousand miles, while Claudius Cæsar\r\nmakes the length, from Dascusa[177] to the borders of the Caspian Sea,\r\nthirteen[178] hundred miles, and the breadth, from Tigranocerta to\r\nIberia,[179] half that distance. It is a well-known fact, that this\r\ncountry is divided into prefectures, called “Strategies,” some of which\r\nsingly formed a kingdom in former times; they are one hundred and\r\ntwenty in number, with barbarous and uncouth names.[180] On the east,\r\nit is bounded, though not immediately, by the Ceraunian Mountains and\r\nthe district of Adiabene. The space that intervenes is occupied by the\r\nSopheni, beyond whom is the chain of mountains,[181] and then beyond\r\nthem the inhabitants of Adiabene. Dwelling in the valleys adjoining to\r\nArmenia are the Menobardi and the Moscheni. The Tigris and inaccessible\r\nmountains surround Adiabene. To the left[182] of it is the territory\r\nof the Medi, and in the distance is seen the Caspian Sea; which, as\r\nwe shall state in the proper place, receives its waters from the\r\nocean,[183] and is wholly surrounded by the Caucasian Mountains. The\r\ninhabitants upon the confines of Armenia shall now be treated of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (10.)—ALBANIA, IBERIA, AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole plain which extends away from the river Cyrus is inhabited\r\nby the nation of the Albani,[184] and, after them,[185] by that of the\r\nIberi,[186] who are separated from them by the river Alazon,[187] which\r\nflows into the Cyrus from the Caucasian chain. The chief cities are\r\nCabalaca,[188] in Albania, Harmastis,[189] near a river[190] of Iberia,\r\nand Neoris; there is the region also of Thasie, and that of Triare,\r\nextending as far as the mountains known as the Paryadres. Beyond\r\nthese[191] are the deserts of Colchios, on the side of which that\r\nlooks towards the Ceraunian Mountains dwell the Armenochalybes;[192]\r\nand there is the country of the Moschi, extending to the river Iberus,\r\nwhich flows into the Cyrus; below them are the Sacassani, and after\r\nthem the Macrones, upon the river Absarus. Such is the manner in which\r\nthe plains and low country are parcelled out. Again, after passing the\r\nconfines of Albania, the wild tribes of the Silvi inhabit the face of\r\nthe mountains, below them those of the Lubieni, and after them the\r\nDiduri and the Sodii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (11.)—THE PASSES OF THE CAUCASUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter passing the last, we come to the Gates of Caucasus,[193] by many\r\npersons most erroneously called the Caspian Passes; a vast work of\r\nnature, which has suddenly wrenched asunder in this place a chain of\r\nmountains. At this spot are gates barred up with beams shod with iron,\r\nwhile beneath the middle there runs a stream which emits a most fetid\r\nodour; on this side of it is a rock, defended by a fortress, the name\r\nof which is Cumania,[194] erected for the purpose of preventing the\r\npassage of the innumerable tribes that lie beyond. Here, then, we may\r\nsee the habitable world severed into two parts by a pair of gates;\r\nthey are just opposite to Harmastis, a town of the Iberi.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Gates of Caucasus, in the Gordyæan Mountains, the Valli and\r\nthe Suani, uncivilized tribes, are found; still, however, they work the\r\nmines of gold there. Beyond these nations, and extending as far away as\r\nPontus, are numerous nations of the Heniochi, and, after them, of the\r\nAchæi. Such is the present state of one of the most famous tracts upon\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\nSome writers have stated that the distance between the Euxine and the\r\nCaspian Sea is not more than three hundred and seventy-five miles;\r\nCornelius Nepos makes it only two hundred and fifty. Within such\r\nstraits is Asia pent up in this second instance[195] by the agency\r\nof the sea! Claudius Cæsar has informed us that from the Cimmerian\r\nBosporus to the Caspian Sea is a distance of only one hundred and\r\nfifty[196] miles, and that Nicator Seleucus[197] contemplated cutting\r\nthrough this isthmus just at the time when he was slain by Ptolemy\r\nCeraunus. It is a well-known fact that the distance from the Gates of\r\nCaucasus to the shores of the Euxine is two hundred miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (12.)—THE ISLANDS OF THE EUXINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe islands of the Euxine are the Planctæ or Cyaneæ,[198] otherwise\r\ncalled Symplegades, and Apollonia, surnamed Thynias,[199] to\r\ndistinguish it from the island of that name[200] in Europe; it is\r\nfour miles in circumference, and one mile distant from the mainland.\r\nOpposite to Pharnacea[201] is Chalceritis, to which the Greeks have\r\ngiven the name of Aria,[202] and consecrated it to Mars; here, they\r\nsay, there were birds that used to attack strangers with blows of their\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (13.)—NATIONS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SCYTHIAN OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now stated all that bears reference to the interior of Asia,\r\nlet us cross in imagination the Riphæan[203] Mountains, and traverse\r\nthe shores of the ocean to the right. On three sides does this ocean\r\nwash the coasts of Asia, as the Scythian Ocean on the north, the\r\nEastern Ocean on the east, and the Indian Ocean on the south; and it\r\nis again divided into various names, derived from the numerous gulfs\r\nwhich it forms, and the nations which dwell upon its shores. A great\r\npart of Asia, however, which lies exposed to the north, through the\r\nnoxious effects of those freezing climates, consists of nothing but\r\nvast deserts. From the extreme north north-east to the point[204] where\r\nthe sun rises in the summer, it is the country of the Scythians. Still\r\nfurther than them, and beyond[205] the point where north north-east\r\nbegins, some writers have placed the Hyperborei, who are said,\r\nindeed, by the majority to be a people of Europe.[206] After passing\r\nthis point,[207] the first place that is known is Lytarmis,[208] a\r\npromontory of Celtica, and next to it the river Carambucis,[209] where\r\nthe chain of the Riphæan Mountains terminates, and with it the extreme\r\nrigour of the climate; here, too, we have heard of a certain people\r\nbeing situate, called the Arimphæi,[210] a race not much unlike the\r\nHyperborei.[211] Their habitations are the groves, and the berries\r\ntheir diet; long hair is held to be disgraceful by the women as well\r\nas the men, and they are mild in their manners. Hence it is that they\r\nare reported to be a sacred[212] race, and are never molested even by\r\nthe savage tribes which border upon them, and not only they, but such\r\nother persons as well as may have fled to them for refuge. Beyond these\r\nwe come straight to the Scythians, the Cimmerii, the Cisianthi, the\r\nGeorgi, and a nation of Amazons.[213] These last extend to the Caspian\r\nand Hyrcanian Sea.[214]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—THE CASPIAN AND HYRCANIAN SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBursting through, this sea makes a passage from the Scythian Ocean into\r\nthe back of Asia,[215] receiving various names from the nations which\r\ndwell upon its banks, the two most famous of which are the Caspian and\r\nthe Hyrcanian races. Clitarchus is of opinion that the Caspian Sea is\r\nnot less in area than the Euxine. Eratosthenes gives the measure of\r\nit on the south-east, along the coast of Cadusia[216] and Albania, as\r\nfive thousand four hundred stadia; thence, through the territories of\r\nthe Anariaci, the Amardi, and the Hyrcani, to the mouth of the river\r\nZonus he makes four thousand eight hundred stadia, and thence to the\r\nmouth of the Jaxartes[217] two thousand four hundred; which makes in\r\nall a distance of one thousand five hundred and seventy-five miles.\r\nArtemidorus, however, makes this sum smaller by twenty-five miles.\r\nAgrippa bounds the Caspian Sea and the nations around it, including\r\nArmenia, on the east by the Ocean of the Seres,[218] on the west by\r\nthe chain of the Caucasus, on the south by that of Taurus, and on the\r\nnorth by the Scythian Ocean; and he states it, so far as its extent is\r\nknown, to be four hundred and eighty miles in length, and two hundred\r\nand ninety in breadth. There are not wanting, however, some authors\r\nwho state that its whole circumference, from the Straits,[219] is two\r\nthousand five hundred miles.\r\n\r\nIts waters make their way into this sea by a very narrow mouth,[220]\r\nbut of considerable length; and where it begins to enlarge, it curves\r\nobliquely with horns in the form of a crescent, just as though it would\r\nmake a descent from its mouth into Lake Mæotis, resembling a sickle\r\nin shape, as M. Varro says. The first[221] of its gulfs is called the\r\nScythian Gulf; it is inhabited on both sides, by the Scythians, who\r\nhold communication with each other across the Straits,[222] the Nomades\r\nbeing on one side, together with the Sauromatæ, divided into tribes\r\nwith numerous names, and on the other, the Abzoæ, who are also divided\r\ninto an equal number. At the entrance, on the right hand side,[223]\r\ndwell the Udini, a Scythian tribe, at the very angle of the mouth. Then\r\nalong[224] the coast there are the Albani, the descendants of Jason,\r\nit is said; that part of the sea which lies in front of them, bears\r\nthe name of ‘Albanian.’ This nation, which lies along the Caucasian\r\nchain, comes down, as we have previously stated,[225] as far as the\r\nriver Cyrus, which forms the boundary of Armenia and Iberia. Above the\r\nmaritime coast of Albania and the nation of the Udini, the Sarmatæ, the\r\nUtidorsi, and the Aroteres stretch along its shores, and in their rear\r\nthe Sauromatian Amazons, already spoken of.[226]\r\n\r\nThe rivers which run through Albania in their course to the sea are the\r\nCasius[227] and the Albanus,[228] and then the Cambyses,[229] which\r\nrises in the Caucasian mountains, and next to it the Cyrus, rising in\r\nthose of the Coraxici, as already mentioned.[230] Agrippa states that\r\nthe whole of this coast, inaccessible from rocks of an immense height,\r\nis four hundred and twenty-five miles in length, beginning from the\r\nriver Casius. After we pass the mouth of the Cyrus, it begins to be\r\ncalled the ‘Caspian Sea;’ the Caspii being a people who dwell upon its\r\nshores.\r\n\r\nIn this place it may be as well to correct an error into which many\r\npersons have fallen, and even those who lately took part with Corbulo\r\nin the Armenian war. The Gates of Iberia, which we have mentioned[231]\r\nas the Caucasian, they have spoken of as being called the ‘Caspian,’\r\nand the coloured plans which have been sent from those parts to Rome\r\nhave that name written upon them. The menaced expedition, too, that was\r\ncontemplated by the Emperor Nero, was said to be designed to extend as\r\nfar as the Caspian Gates, whereas it was really intended for those\r\nwhich lead through Iberia into the territory of the Sarmatæ; there\r\nbeing hardly any possibility of approach to the Caspian Sea, by reason\r\nof the close juxtaposition of the mountains there. There are, however,\r\nother Caspian Gates, which join up to the Caspian tribes; but these can\r\nonly be distinguished from a perusal of the narrative of those who took\r\npart in the expedition of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—ADIABENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of the Persians, by which we now understand that of\r\nParthia, is elevated upon the Caucasian chain between two seas, the\r\nPersian and the Hyrcanian. To the Greater Armenia, which in the front\r\nslopes towards Commagene, is joined Sophene, which lies upon the\r\ndescent[232] on both sides thereof, and next to it is Adiabene, the\r\nmost advanced frontier of Assyria; a part of which is Arbelitis,[233]\r\nwhere Alexander conquered Darius, and which joins up to Syria. The\r\nwhole of this country was called Mygdonia by the Macedonians, on\r\naccount of the resemblance it bore to Mygdonia[234] in Europe. Its\r\ncities are Alexandria,[235] and Antiochia, also called Nisibis;[236]\r\nthis last place is distant from Artaxata seven hundred and fifty miles.\r\nThere was also in former times Ninus,[237] a most renowned city, on the\r\nbanks of the Tigris, with an aspect towards the west. Adjoining the\r\nother front of Greater Armenia, which runs down towards the Caspian\r\nSea, we find Atropatene,[238] which is separated from Otene, a region\r\nof Armenia, by the river Araxes; Gazæ[239] is its chief city, distant\r\nfrom Artaxata four hundred and fifty miles, and the same from Ecbatana\r\nin Media, to which country Atropatene belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (14.)—MEDIA AND THE CASPIAN GATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEcbatana,[240] the capital of Media, was built[241] by king Seleucus,\r\nat a distance from Great Seleucia of seven hundred and fifty miles, and\r\ntwenty miles from the Caspian Gates. The remaining towns of the Medians\r\nare Phazaca, Aganzaga, and Apamea,[242] surnamed Rhagiane. The reason\r\nof these passes receiving the name of “Gates,” is the same that has\r\nbeen stated above.[243] The chain of mountains is suddenly broken by a\r\npassage of such extreme narrowness that, for a distance of eight miles,\r\na single chariot can barely find room to move along: the whole of this\r\npass has been formed by artificial means. Both on the right hand and\r\nthe left are overhanging rocks, which look as though they had been\r\nexposed to the action of fire; and there is a tract of country, quite\r\ndestitute of water, twenty-eight miles in extent. This narrow pass,\r\ntoo, is rendered still more difficult by a liquid salt which oozes from\r\nthe rocks, and uniting in a single stream, makes its way along the\r\npass. Besides this, it is frequented by such multitudes of serpents,\r\nthat the passage is quite impracticable except in winter.\r\n\r\n(15.) Joining up to Adiabene are the people formerly known as the\r\n‘Carduchi,’ now the Cordueni,[244] in front of whom the river Tigris\r\nflows: and next to them are the Pratitæ, entitled the _Par Odon_,[245]\r\nwho hold possession of the Caspian Gates.[246] On the other side[247]\r\nof these gates we come to the deserts[248] of Parthia and the mountain\r\nchain of Cithenus; and after that, the most pleasant locality of all\r\nParthia, Choara[249] by name. Here were two cities of the Parthians,\r\nbuilt in former times for their protection against the people of Media,\r\nCalliope,[250] and Issatis, the last of which stood formerly[251] on a\r\nrock. Hecatompylos,[252] the capital of Parthia, is distant from the\r\nCaspian Gates one hundred and thirty-three miles. In such an effectual\r\nmanner is the kingdom of Parthia shut out by these passes. After\r\nleaving these gates we find the nation of the Caspii, extending as\r\nfar as the shores of the Caspian, a race which has given its name to\r\nthese gates as well as to the sea: on the left there is a mountainous\r\ndistrict. Turning back[253] from this nation to the river Cyrus, the\r\ndistance is said to be two hundred and twenty miles; but if we go from\r\nthat river as far down as the Caspian Gates, the distance is seven\r\nhundred[254] miles. In the itineraries of Alexander the Great these\r\ngates were made the central or turning point in his expeditions; the\r\ndistance from the Caspian Gates to the frontier of India being there\r\nset down as fifteen thousand six hundred and eighty[255] stadia, to the\r\ncity of Bactra,[256] commonly called Zariaspa, three thousand seven\r\nhundred, and thence to the river Jaxartes[257] five thousand stadia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18. (16.)—NATIONS SITUATE AROUND THE HYRCANIAN SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLying to the east of the Caspii is the region known as Apavortene,[258]\r\nin which there is a place noted for its singular fertility, called\r\nDareium.[259] We then come to the nations of the Tapyri,[260] the\r\nAnariaci, the Staures, and the Hyrcani, past whose shores and beyond\r\nthe river Sideris[261] the Caspian begins to take the name of the\r\n‘Hyrcanian’ Sea: on this side of that stream are also the rivers\r\nMaxeras and Strato; all of them take their rise in the Caucasian chain.\r\nNext comes the district of Margiane,[262] so remarkable for its sunny\r\nclimate. It is the only spot in all these regions that produces the\r\nvine, being shut in on every side by verdant and refreshing hills.\r\nThis district is fifteen hundred stadia in circumference, but is\r\nrendered remarkably difficult of access by sandy deserts, which extend\r\na distance of one hundred and twenty miles: it lies opposite to the\r\ncountry of Parthia, and in it Alexander founded the city of Alexandria.\r\nThis place having been destroyed by the barbarians, Antiochus,[263] the\r\nson of Seleucus, rebuilt it on the same site as a Syrian city.[264]\r\nFor, seeing that it was watered by the Margus,[265] which passes\r\nthrough it, and is afterwards divided into a number of streams for the\r\nirrigation of the district of Zothale, he restored it, but preferred\r\ngiving it the name of Antiochia.[266] The circumference of this city\r\nis seventy stadia: it was to this place that Orodes conducted such of\r\nthe Romans as had survived the defeat of Crassus. From the mountain\r\nheights of this district, along the range of Caucasus, the savage race\r\nof the Mardi, a free people, extends as far as the Bactri.[267] Below\r\nthe district inhabited by them, we find the nations of the Orciani,\r\nthe Commori, the Berdrigæ, the Harmatotropi,[268] the Citomaræ, the\r\nComani, the Marucæi, and the Mandruani. The rivers here are the Mandrus\r\nand the Chindrus.[269] Beyond the nations already mentioned, are the\r\nChorasmii,[270] the Candari,[271] the Attasini, the Paricani, the\r\nSarangæ, the Marotiani, the Aorsi,[272] the Gaëli, by the Greek writers\r\ncalled Cadusii,[273] the Matiani, the city of Heraclea,[274] which was\r\nfounded by Alexander, but was afterwards destroyed, and rebuilt by\r\nAntiochus, and by him called Achaïs; the Derbices also,[275] through\r\nthe middle of whose territory the river Oxus[276] runs, after rising in\r\nLake Oxus,[277] the Syrmatæ, the Oxydracæ, the Heniochi, the Bateni,\r\nthe Saraparæ, and the Bactri, whose chief city is Zariaspe, which\r\nafterwards received the name of Bactra, from the river[278] there.\r\nThis last nation lies at the back of Mount Paropanisus,[279] over\r\nagainst the sources of the river Indus, and is bounded by the river\r\nOchus.[280] Beyond it are the Sogdiani,[281] the town of Panda, and,\r\nat the very extremity of their territory, Alexandria,[282] founded by\r\nAlexander the Great. At this spot are the altars which were raised by\r\nHercules and Father Liber, as also by Cyrus, Semiramis, and Alexander;\r\nfor the expeditions of all these conquerors stopped short at this\r\nregion, bounded as it is by the river Jaxartes, by the Scythians known\r\nas the Silis, and by Alexander and his officers supposed to have been\r\nthe Tanais. This river was crossed by Demodamas, a general of kings\r\nSeleucus and Antiochus, and whose account more particularly we have\r\nhere followed. He also consecrated certain altars here to Apollo\r\nDidymæus.[283]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (17.)—THE NATIONS OF SCYTHIA AND THE COUNTRIES ON THE EASTERN\r\nOCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond this river are the peoples of Scythia. The Persians have called\r\nthem by the general name of Sacæ,[284] which properly belongs to only\r\nthe nearest nation of them. The more ancient writers give them the\r\nname of Aramii. The Scythians themselves give the name of “Chorsari”\r\nto the Persians, and they call Mount Caucasus Graucasis, which means\r\n“white with snow.” The multitude of these Scythian nations is quite\r\ninnumerable: in their life and habits they much resemble the people of\r\nParthia. The tribes among them that are better known are the Sacæ, the\r\nMassagetæ,[285] the Dahæ,[286] the Essedones,[287] the Ariacæ,[288]\r\nthe Rhymmici, the Pæsici, the Amardi,[289] the Histi, the Edones, the\r\nCamæ, the Camacæ, the Euchatæ,[290] the Cotieri, the Anthusiani, the\r\nPsacæ, the Arimaspi,[291] the Antacati, the Chroasai, and the Œtei;\r\namong them the Napæi[292] are said to have been destroyed by the\r\nPalæi. The rivers in their country that are the best known, are the\r\nMandragæus and the Carpasus. Indeed upon no subject that I know of\r\nare there greater discrepancies among writers, from the circumstance,\r\nI suppose, of these nations being so extremely numerous, and of such\r\nmigratory habits. Alexander the Great has left it stated that the\r\nwater of this sea[293] is fresh, and M. Varro informs us, that some of\r\nit, of a similar character, was brought to Pompey, when holding the\r\nchief command in the Mithridatic war in its vicinity; the salt,[294]\r\nno doubt, being overpowered by the volume of water discharged by the\r\nrivers which flow into it. He adds also, that under the direction of\r\nPompey, it was ascertained that it is seven days’ journey from India to\r\nthe river Icarus,[295] in the country of the Bactri, which discharges\r\nitself into the Oxus, and that the merchandize of India being conveyed\r\nfrom it[296] through the Caspian Sea into the Cyrus, may be brought\r\nby land to Phasis in Pontus, in five days at most. There are numerous\r\nislands throughout the whole of the Caspian sea: the only one that is\r\nwell known is that of Tazata.[297]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—THE SERES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter we have passed the Caspian Sea and the Scythian Ocean, our course\r\ntakes an easterly direction, such being the turn here taken by the\r\nline of the coast. The first portion[298] of these shores, after we\r\npass the Scythian Promontory, is totally uninhabitable, owing to the\r\nsnow, and the regions adjoining are uncultivated, in consequence of the\r\nsavage state of the nations which dwell there. Here are the abodes of\r\nthe Scythian Anthropophagi,[299] who feed on human flesh. Hence it is\r\nthat all around them consists of vast deserts, inhabited by multitudes\r\nof wild beasts, which are continually lying in wait, ready to fall\r\nupon human beings just as savage as themselves. After leaving these,\r\nwe again come to a nation of the Scythians, and then again to desert\r\ntracts tenanted by wild beasts, until we reach a chain of mountains\r\nwhich runs up to the sea, and bears the name of Tabis.[300] It is\r\nnot, however, before we have traversed very nearly one half of the\r\ncoast that looks towards the north-east, that we find it occupied by\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe first people that are known of here are the Seres,[301] so famous\r\nfor the wool that is found in their forests.[302] After steeping it in\r\nwater, they comb off a white down that adheres to the leaves; and then\r\nto the females of our part of the world they give the twofold task[303]\r\nof unravelling their textures, and of weaving the threads afresh. So\r\nmanifold is the labour, and so distant are the regions which are thus\r\nransacked to supply a dress through which our ladies may in public\r\ndisplay[304] their charms. The Seres are of inoffensive manners, but,\r\nbearing a strong resemblance therein to all savage nations, they shun\r\nall intercourse with the rest of mankind, and await the approach[305]\r\nof those who wish to traffic with them. The first river that is known\r\nin their territory is the Psitharas,[306] next to that the Cambari,\r\nand the third the Laros; after which we come to the Promontory of\r\nChryse,[307] the Gulf of Cynaba, the river Atianos, and the nation of\r\nthe Attacori on the gulf of that name, a people protected by their\r\nsunny hills from all noxious blasts, and living in a climate of the\r\nsame temperature as that of the Hyperborei. Amometus has written a work\r\nentirely devoted to the history of these people, just as Hecatæus has\r\ndone in his treatise on the Hyperborei. After the Attacori, we find\r\nthe nations of the Phruri and the Tochari, and, in the interior, the\r\nCasiri, a people of India, who look toward the Scythians, and feed on\r\nhuman flesh. Here are also numerous wandering Nomad tribes of India.\r\nThere are some authors who state that in a north-easterly direction\r\nthese nations touch upon the Cicones[308] and the Brysari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—THE NATIONS OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we come now to nations as to which there is a more general\r\nagreement among writers. Where the chain of Emodus[309] rises, the\r\nnations of India begin, which borders not only on the Eastern sea,\r\nbut on the Southern as well, which we have already mentioned[310] as\r\nbeing called the Indian Ocean. That part which faces the east runs in\r\na straight line a distance of eighteen hundred and seventy-five miles\r\nuntil it comes to a bend, at which the Indian Ocean begins. Here it\r\ntakes a turn to the south, and continues to run in that direction a\r\ndistance of two thousand four hundred and seventy-five miles, according\r\nto Eratosthenes, as far as the river Indus, the boundary of India on\r\nthe west.[311] Many authors have represented the entire length of the\r\nIndian coast as being forty days’ and nights’ sail, and as being,\r\nfrom north to south, two thousand eight hundred and fifty miles.\r\nAgrippa states its length to be three thousand three hundred miles,\r\nand its breadth, two thousand three hundred. Posidonius has given its\r\nmeasurement as lying from north-east to south-east, placing it opposite\r\nto Gaul, of which country he has given the measurement as lying from\r\nnorth-west to south-west; making the whole of India to lie due west of\r\nGaul. Hence, as he has shewn by undoubted proofs, India lying opposite\r\nto Gaul must be refreshed by the blowing of that wind,[312] and derive\r\nits salubrity therefrom.\r\n\r\nIn this region, the appearance of the heavens is totally changed, and\r\nquite different is the rising of the stars; there are two summers in\r\nthe year, and two harvests, while the winter intervenes between them\r\nduring the time that the Etesian[313] winds are blowing: during our\r\nwinter too, they enjoy light breezes, and their seas are navigable. In\r\nthis country there are nations and cities which would be found to be\r\nquite innumerable, if a person should attempt to enumerate them. For\r\nit has been explored not only by the arms of Alexander the Great and\r\nof the kings who succeeded him, by Seleucus and Antiochus, who sailed\r\nround even to the Caspian and Hyrcanian Sea, and by Patrocles,[314]\r\nthe admiral of their fleet, but has been treated of by several other\r\nGreek writers who resided at the courts of Indian kings, such, for\r\ninstance, as Megasthenes, and by Dionysius, who was sent thither by\r\nPhiladelphus, expressly for the purpose: all of whom have enlarged upon\r\nthe power and vast resources of these nations. Still, however, there is\r\nno possibility of being rigorously exact, so different are the accounts\r\ngiven, and often of a nature so incredible. The followers of Alexander\r\nthe Great have stated in their writings, that there were no less than\r\nfive thousand cities in that portion of India which they vanquished by\r\nforce of arms, not one of which was smaller than that of Cos;[315] that\r\nits nations were eight in number, that India forms one-third of the\r\nwhole earth, and that its populations are innumerable—a thing which is\r\ncertainly far from improbable, seeing that the Indians are nearly the\r\nonly race of people who have never migrated from their own territories.\r\nFrom the time of Father Liber[316] to that of Alexander the Great,\r\none hundred and fifty-three kings of India are reckoned, extending\r\nover a period of six thousand four hundred and fifty-one years and\r\nthree months. The vast extent of their rivers is quite marvellous; it\r\nis stated that on no one day did Alexander the Great sail less than\r\nsix hundred stadia[317] on the Indus, and still was unable to reach\r\nits mouth in less than five months and some few days: and yet it is a\r\nwell-known fact that this river is not so large as the Ganges.[318]\r\nSeneca, one of our fellow-countrymen, who has written a treatise[319]\r\nupon the subject of India, has given its rivers as sixty-five in\r\nnumber, and its nations as one hundred and eighteen. The difficulty\r\ntoo would be quite as great, if we were to attempt to enumerate its\r\nmountains. The chains of Emaüs, of Emodus, of Paropanisus, and of\r\nCaucasus, are all connected, the one with the other; and from their\r\nfoot, the country of India runs down in the form of a vast plain,\r\nbearing a very considerable resemblance to that of Egypt.\r\n\r\nHowever, that we may come to a better understanding relative to the\r\ndescription of these regions, we will follow in the track of Alexander\r\nthe Great. Diognetus and Bæton, whose duty it was to ascertain the\r\ndistances and length of his expeditions, have written that from the\r\nCaspian Gates to Hecatompylon, the city of the Parthians, the distance\r\nis the number of miles which we have already[320] stated; and that\r\nfrom thence to Alexandria,[321] of the Arii, which city was founded by\r\nthe same king, the distance is five hundred and seventy-five miles;\r\nfrom thence to Prophthasia,[322] the city of the Drangæ, one hundred\r\nand ninety-nine; from thence to the city of the Arachosii,[323] five\r\nhundred and sixty-five; from thence to Ortospanum,[324] one hundred\r\nand seventy-five; and from thence to the city built by Alexander,[325]\r\nfifty, miles. In some copies, however, the numbers are found\r\ndifferently stated; and we find this last city even placed at the very\r\nfoot of Mount Caucasus! From this place to the river Cophes[326] and\r\nPeucolaitis, a city of India, is two hundred and thirty-seven miles;\r\nfrom thence to the river Indus and the city of Taxilla[327] sixty; from\r\nthence to the famous river Hydaspes[328] one hundred and twenty; and\r\nfrom thence to the Hypasis,[329] a river no less famous, two hundred\r\nand ninety miles, and three hundred and ninety paces. This last was\r\nthe extreme limit of the expedition of Alexander, though he crossed\r\nthe river and dedicated certain altars[330] on the opposite side. The\r\ndispatches written by order of that king fully agree with the distances\r\nabove stated.\r\n\r\nThe remaining distances beyond the above point were ascertained on the\r\nexpedition of Seleucus Nicator. They are, to the river Sydrus,[331]\r\none hundred and sixty-eight miles; to the river Jomanes, the same;\r\nsome copies, however, add to this last distance five miles; thence\r\nto the Ganges, one hundred and twelve miles; to Rhodapha, five\r\nhundred and sixty-nine—though, according to some writers, this last\r\ndistance is only three hundred and twenty-five miles; to the town\r\nof Calinipaxa,[332] one hundred and sixty-seven, according to some,\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-five; thence to the confluence of the river\r\nJomanes[333] and Ganges, six hundred and twenty-five; most writers,\r\nhowever, add thirteen miles to this last distance; thence to the city\r\nof Palibothra,[334] four hundred and twenty-five—and thence to the\r\nmouth of the Ganges, six hundred and thirty-seven miles and a half.\r\n\r\nThe nations whom it may be not altogether inopportune to mention,\r\nafter passing the Emodian Mountains, a cross range of which is called\r\n“Imaus,” a word which, in the language of the natives, signifies\r\n“snowy,”[335] are the Isari, the Cosyri, the Izi, and, upon the chain\r\nof mountains, the Chisiotosagi, with numerous peoples, which have the\r\nsurname of Brachmanæ,[336] among whom are the Maccocalingæ. There are\r\nalso the rivers Prinas and Cainas,[337] which last flows into the\r\nGanges, both of them navigable streams. The nation of the Calingæ[338]\r\ncomes nearest to the sea, and above them are the Mandei and the\r\nMalli.[339] In the territory of the last-named people is a mountain\r\ncalled Mallus: the boundary of this region is the river Ganges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (18.)—THE GANGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome writers have stated that this river, like the Nile, takes its\r\nrise from unknown sources,[340] and, in a similar manner, waters\r\nthe neighbouring territory; others, again, say that it rises in the\r\nmountains of Scythia. They state also that nineteen rivers discharge\r\ntheir waters into it; those among them that are navigable, besides\r\nthe rivers already mentioned,[341] are the Condochates,[342] the\r\nErannoboas,[343] the Cosoagus,[344] and the Sonus. Other writers again\r\nsay that it bursts forth at its very source with a loud noise, hurling\r\nitself over rocks and precipices; and that after it has reached the\r\nplains, its waters become more tranquil, and it pauses for a time in\r\na certain lake, after which it flows gently on. They say also that it\r\nis eight miles in breadth, where it is the very narrowest, and one\r\nhundred stadia where it is but moderately wide, and that it is nowhere\r\nless than twenty paces in depth. The last nation situate on the banks\r\nof the Ganges is that of the Gangarides[345] Calingæ; the city where\r\ntheir king dwells has the name of Protalis.[346]\r\n\r\n(19.) This king has sixty thousand foot-soldiers, one thousand horse,\r\nand seven hundred elephants, always caparisoned ready for battle. The\r\npeople of the more civilized nations of India are divided into several\r\nclasses.[347] One of these classes till the earth, another attends to\r\nmilitary affairs, others again are occupied in mercantile pursuits,\r\nwhile the wisest and the most wealthy among them have the management\r\nof the affairs of state—act as judges, and give counsel to the king.\r\nThe fifth class,[348] entirely devoting themselves to the pursuit of\r\nwisdom, which in these countries is almost held in the same veneration\r\nas religion, always[349] end their life by a voluntary death upon\r\nthe lighted pile. In addition to these, there is a class[350] in a\r\nhalf-savage state, and doomed to endless labour; by means of their\r\nexertions, all the classes previously mentioned are supported. It is\r\ntheir duty to hunt[351] the elephant, and to tame him when captured;\r\nfor it is by the aid of these animals that they plough; by these\r\nanimals they are conveyed from place to place; these in especial they\r\nlook upon as constituting their flocks and herds; by their aid they\r\nwage their wars, and fight in defence of their territories. Strength,\r\nage, and size, are the points usually considered in making choice of\r\nthese animals.\r\n\r\nIn the Ganges there is an island of very considerable size, inhabited\r\nby a single nation; it is called Modogalinga.[352] Beyond the Ganges\r\nare situate the Modubæ, the Molindæ, the Uberæ, with a magnificent\r\ncity of the same name, the Modresi, the Preti, the Caloæ, the Sasuri,\r\nthe Passalæ, the Colobæ, the Orumcolæ, the Abali, and the Thalutæ. The\r\nking of the last-named people has fifty thousand foot-soldiers, four\r\nthousand horse, and four hundred armed elephants. We next come to a\r\nstill more powerful nation, the Andaræ,[353] who dwell in numerous\r\nvillages, as well as thirty cities fortified with walls and towers.\r\nThey furnish for their king one hundred thousand foot, two thousand\r\nhorse, and a thousand elephants. The country of the Dardæ[354] is the\r\nmost productive of gold, that of the Setæ of silver.\r\n\r\nBut more famous and more powerful than any nation, not only in these\r\nregions, but throughout almost the whole of India, are the Prasii,\r\nwho dwell in a city of vast extent and of remarkable opulence, called\r\nPalibothra;[355] from which circumstance some writers have given to the\r\npeople themselves the name of Palibothri, and, indeed, to the whole\r\ntract of country between the Ganges and the Indus. These people keep on\r\ndaily pay in their king’s service an army, consisting of six hundred\r\nthousand foot, thirty thousand horse, and nine thousand elephants,\r\nfrom which we may easily form a conjecture as to the vast extent of\r\ntheir resources. Behind these people, and lying still more in the\r\ninterior, are the Monedes, and the Suari,[356] among whom is a mountain\r\nknown as Maleus, upon which the shadow falls to the north in winter,\r\nand to the south in summer, six months alternately. In this district\r\nthe Constellation of the Greater Bear[357] is seen at only one period\r\nin the year, and then but for fifteen days, according to what Bæton\r\nstates. Megasthenes, however, informs us that the same is the case also\r\nin many other localities of India. The South Pole is by the Indians\r\ncalled Diamasa.\r\n\r\nThe river Jomanes runs into the Ganges through the territory of the\r\nPalibothri, between the cities of Methora[358] and Chrysobora.[359]\r\nIn the regions which lie to the south[360] of the Ganges, the people\r\nare tinted by the heat of the sun, so much so as to be quite coloured,\r\nbut yet not burnt black, like the Æthiopians. The nearer[361] they\r\napproach the Indus, the deeper their colour, a proof of the heat of the\r\nclimate. After leaving the nation of the Prasii, we immediately come\r\nto the Indus; in the mountains of the Prasii a race of Pygmies is said\r\nto exist. Artemidorus says that between these two rivers there is a\r\ndistance of two thousand one hundred miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (20.)—THE INDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indus, called Sindis by the natives, rises in that branch of the\r\nCaucasian range which bears the name of Paropanisus,[362] and runs in\r\nan easterly direction, receiving in its course the waters of nineteen\r\nrivers. The most famous of these are the Hydaspes,[363] into which four\r\nother rivers have already discharged themselves, the Cantaba,[364]\r\nwhich receives three other rivers, the Acesinus, and the Hypasis,[365]\r\nwhich last two are navigable themselves. Still however, so moderate, as\r\nit were, do the waters of this river show themselves in their course,\r\nthat it is never more than fifty stadia in width, nor does it ever\r\nexceed fifteen paces in depth. Of two islands, which it forms in its\r\ncourse, the one, which is known as Prasiane, is of very considerable\r\nsize; the other, which is smaller, is called Patale. According to the\r\naccounts given by the most moderate writers, this river is navigable\r\nfor a distance of twelve hundred and fifty miles, and after following\r\nthe sun’s course to the west, in some degree, discharges itself into\r\nthe ocean. I will here give the distances of various places situate on\r\nthe coast to the mouth of this river, in a general way, just as I find\r\nthem stated, although they none of them tally with each other.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Ganges to the Promontory of the Calingi and the\r\ntown of Dandaguda,[366] is six hundred and twenty-five miles; from\r\nthence to Tropina twelve hundred and twenty-five; from thence to the\r\npromontory of Perimula, where is held the most celebrated mart in all\r\nIndia, seven hundred and fifty, and from thence to the city of Patala,\r\nin the island just mentioned, six hundred and twenty miles.\r\n\r\nThe mountain races between the Indus and the Jomanes are the Cesi,[367]\r\nthe Cetriboni, who dwell in the woods, and after them the Megallæ,\r\nwhose king possesses five hundred elephants, and an army of horse\r\nand foot, the numbers of which are unknown; then the Chrysei, the\r\nParasangæ, and the Asmagi,[368] whose territory is infested by wild\r\ntigers; these people keep in arms thirty thousand foot, three\r\nhundred elephants, and eight hundred horse. They are bounded by the\r\nriver Indus, and encircled by a range of mountains and deserts for a\r\ndistance of six hundred and twenty-five miles. Below these deserts\r\nare the Dari and the Suræ, and then deserts again for one hundred and\r\neighty-seven miles, sands in general encircling these spots just as\r\nislands are surrounded by the sea. Below these deserts, again, are\r\nthe Maltecoræ, the Singæ, the Marohæ, the Rarungæ, and the Morontes.\r\nThese last peoples, who possess the mountains throughout the whole\r\nrange of country as far as the shores of the ocean, are free, and\r\nindependent of all kings, and hold numerous cities upon the declivities\r\nof the mountains. After them come the Nareæ,[369] who are bounded by\r\nCapitalia, the most lofty of all the Indian peaks: the inhabitants\r\nwho dwell on the other side of it have extensive mines of gold and\r\nsilver. After these again are the Oratæ, whose king possesses only\r\nten elephants, but a large army of foot; next come the Suarataratæ,\r\nwho live under the rule of a king as well, but breed no elephants, as\r\nthey depend solely on their horse and foot; then the Odonbeores, the\r\nArabastræ, and the Horacæ, which last inhabit a fine city fortified by\r\ntrenches cut in the marshes. It is quite impossible to approach the\r\ncity, except by the bridge, as the water in the trenches is full of\r\ncrocodiles, an animal most insatiate for human flesh. There is another\r\ncity also in their territory, which has been greatly extolled, Automula\r\nby name, situate on the sea-shore, a famous mart, lying at the point\r\nof confluence of five rivers: their king possesses sixteen hundred\r\nelephants, one hundred and fifty thousand foot, and five thousand\r\nhorse. The king of the Charmæ is a less opulent potentate; he has\r\nonly sixty elephants and some small remains of his former strength.\r\nAfter these we come to the nation of the Pandæ,[370] the only one\r\nthroughout all India which is ruled by women. It is said that Hercules\r\nhad but one child of the female sex, for which reason she was his\r\nespecial favourite, and he bestowed upon her the principal one of these\r\nkingdoms. The sovereigns who derive their origin from this female,\r\nrule over three hundred towns, and have an army of one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand foot, and five hundred elephants. After passing through\r\nthis list of three hundred cities, we come to the Darangæ,[371] the\r\nPosingæ, the Butæ, the Gogaræi, the Umbræ, the Nereæ, the Brancosi, the\r\nNobundæ, the Cocondæ, the Nesei, the Palatitæ, the Salobriasæ, and the\r\nOlostræ, who reach up to the island of Patala, from the extremity of\r\nwhose shores to the Caspian Gates it is a distance of nineteen hundred\r\nand twenty-five miles.\r\n\r\nAfter passing this island, the other side of the Indus is occupied, as\r\nwe know by clear and undoubted proofs, by the Athoæ, the Bolingæ, the\r\nGallitalutæ, the Dimuri, the Megari, the Ardabæ, the Mesæ, and after\r\nthem, the Uri and the Silæ; beyond which last there are desert tracts,\r\nextending a distance of two hundred and fifty miles. After passing\r\nthese nations, we come to the Organagæ, the Abortæ, the Bassuertæ, and,\r\nafter these last, deserts similar to those previously mentioned. We\r\nthen come to the peoples of the Sorofages, the Arbæ, the Marogomatræ,\r\nthe Umbrittæ, of whom there are twelve nations, each with two cities,\r\nand the Asini, a people who dwell in three cities, their capital\r\nbeing Bucephala,[372] which was founded around the tomb of the horse\r\nbelonging to king Alexander, which bore that name. Above these peoples\r\nthere are some mountain tribes, which lie at the foot of Caucasus, the\r\nSoseadæ and the Sondræ, and, after passing the Indus and going down\r\nits stream, the Samarabriæ, the Sambraceni, the Bisambritæ, the Orsi,\r\nthe Anixeni, and the Taxilæ, with a famous city,[373] which lies on a\r\nlow but level plain, the general name of the district being Amenda:\r\nthere are four nations here, the Peucolaitæ,[374] the Arsagalitæ, the\r\nGeretæ, and the Assoï.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the geographers, in fact, do not look upon India\r\nas bounded by the river Indus, but add to it the four Satrapies\r\nof the Gedrosi,[375] the Arachotæ,[376] the Arii,[377] and the\r\nParopanisidæ,[378] the river Cophes[379] thus forming the extreme\r\nboundary of India. All these territories, however, according to other\r\nwriters, are reckoned as belonging to the country of the Arii. (21.)\r\nMany writers, too, place in India the city of Nysa,[380] and the\r\nmountain of Merus, sacred to Father Bacchus; in which circumstance[381]\r\noriginated the story that he sprang from the thigh of Jupiter. They\r\nalso place here the nation of the Astacani, whose country abounds\r\nin the vine, the laurel, the box-tree, and all the fruits which are\r\nproduced in Greece. As to those wonderful and almost fabulous stories\r\nwhich are related about the fertility of the soil, and the various\r\nkinds of fruits and trees, as well as wild beasts, and birds, and other\r\nsorts of animals, they shall be mentioned each in its proper place, in\r\na future portion of this work. I shall also very shortly have to make\r\nsome further mention of the four Satrapies, it being at present my wish\r\nto hasten to a description of the island of Taprobane.\r\n\r\nBut first there are some other islands of which we must make mention.\r\nPatala,[382] as we have already stated, lies at the mouth of the Indus:\r\nit is of a triangular figure, and is two hundred and twenty miles\r\nin breadth. Beyond the mouth of the Indus are the islands of Chryse\r\nand Argyre,[383] abounding in metals, I believe; but as to what some\r\npersons have stated, that their soil consists of gold and silver, I am\r\nnot so willing to give a ready credence to that. After passing these\r\nislands we come to Crocala,[384] twenty miles in breadth, and then,\r\nat twelve miles’ distance from it, Bibraga,[385] abounding in oysters\r\nand other shell-fish. At eight miles’ distance from Bibraga we find\r\nToralliba, and many others of no note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (22.)—TAPROBANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaprobane,[386] under the name of the “land of the Antichthones,”[387]\r\nwas long looked upon as another world: the age and the arms of\r\nAlexander the Great were the first to give satisfactory proof that it\r\nis an island. Onesicritus, the commander of his fleet, has informed\r\nus that the elephants of this island are larger, and better adapted\r\nfor warfare than those of India; and from Megasthenes we learn that\r\nit is divided by a river, that the inhabitants have the name of\r\nPalæogoni,[388] and that their country is more productive of gold and\r\npearls of great size than even India. Eratosthenes has also given the\r\ndimensions of this island, as being seven thousand stadia in length,\r\nand five thousand in breadth: he states also that there are no cities,\r\nbut villages to the number of seven hundred.[389] It begins at the\r\nEastern sea, and lies extended opposite to India, east and west. This\r\nisland was in former times supposed to be twenty days’ sail from the\r\ncountry of the Prasii,[390] but in later times, whereas the navigation\r\nwas formerly confined to vessels constructed of papyrus with the tackle\r\npeculiar to the Nile, the distance has been estimated at no more\r\nthan seven days’[391] sail, in reference to the speed which can be\r\nattained by vessels of our construction. The sea that lies between the\r\nisland and the mainland is full of shallows, not more than six paces\r\nin depth; but in certain channels it is of such extraordinary depth,\r\nthat no anchor has ever found a bottom. For this reason it is that the\r\nvessels are constructed with prows at either end; so that there may\r\nbe no necessity for tacking while navigating these channels, which\r\nare extremely narrow. The tonnage of these vessels is three thousand\r\namphoræ.[392] In traversing their seas, the people of Taprobane take\r\nno observations of the stars, and indeed the Greater Bear[393] is not\r\nvisible to them; but they carry birds out to sea, which they let go\r\nfrom time to time, and so follow their course as they make for the\r\nland. They devote only four months in the year to the pursuits of\r\nnavigation, and are particularly careful not to trust themselves on\r\nthe sea during the next hundred days after our summer solstice, for in\r\nthose seas it is at that time the middle of winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus much we learn from the ancient writers; it has fallen to our lot,\r\nhowever, to obtain a still more accurate knowledge of these people; for\r\nduring the reign of the Emperor Claudius, an embassy came from even\r\nthis distant island to Rome. The circumstances under which this took\r\nplace were as follow: Annius Plocamus had farmed from the treasury the\r\nrevenues arising from the Red Sea. A certain freedman of his, while\r\nsailing around Arabia, was carried away by a gale from the north beyond\r\nthe coast of Carmania. In the course of fifteen days he had drifted to\r\nHippuros, a port of Taprobane, where he was most kindly and hospitably\r\nreceived by the king; and having, after a study of six months, become\r\nwell acquainted with the language, was enabled to answer all his\r\nenquiries relative to the Romans and their emperor. But of all that he\r\nheard, the king was more particularly struck with surprise at our rigid\r\nnotions of justice, on ascertaining that among the money found on the\r\ncaptive, the denarii were all of equal weight, although the different\r\nfigures on them plainly showed that they had been struck in the reigns\r\nof several emperors. By this circumstance in especial, the king was\r\nprompted to form an alliance with the Romans, and accordingly sent to\r\nRome an embassy, consisting of four persons, the chief of whom was\r\nRachias.[394]\r\n\r\nFrom these persons we learned that in Taprobane there are five hundred\r\ntowns, and that there is a harbour that lies facing the south, and\r\nadjoining the city of Palæsimundus,[395] the most famous city in the\r\nisle, the king’s place of residence, and containing a population of\r\ntwo hundred thousand. They also informed us that in the interior there\r\nis a lake called Megisba, three hundred and seventy-five miles in\r\ncircumference, and containing islands which are fertile, though for\r\npasturage only. In this lake they informed us two rivers take their\r\nrise, one of which, called Palæsimundus, flows into the harbour near\r\nthe city of that name, by three channels, the narrowest of which is\r\nfive stadia in width, the largest fifteen; while the other, Cydara by\r\nname, takes a direction northward, towards the Indian coast. We learned\r\nalso that the nearest point of the Indian coast is a promontory\r\nknown as Coliacum,[396] distant from the island four days’ sail, and\r\nthat midway between them lies the island of the Sun. They stated also\r\nthat those seas are of a deep green tint; besides which, there are\r\nnumerous trees growing at the bottom, so much so, that the rudders of\r\nthe vessels frequently break off portions of their foliage.[397] They\r\nwere much astonished at the constellations which are visible to us,\r\nthe Greater Bear and the Pleiades,[398] as though they had now beheld\r\na new expanse of the heavens; and they declared that in their country\r\nthe moon can only be seen above the horizon[399] from the eighth to\r\nits sixteenth day. They also stated that Canopus, a large bright\r\nstar, gives light to them by night. But what surprised them more than\r\nanything, was that the shadow of their bodies was thrown towards our\r\nhemisphere[400] and not theirs, and that the sun arose on the left hand\r\nand set on the right, and not in the opposite direction.[401] They\r\nalso informed us that the side of their island which lies opposite to\r\nIndia is ten thousand stadia in length, and runs in a south-easterly\r\ndirection—that beyond the Emodian Mountains they look towards[402]\r\nthe Seræ, whose acquaintance they had also made in the pursuits of\r\ncommerce; that the father of Rachias had frequently visited their\r\ncountry, and that the Seræ always came to meet them on their arrival.\r\nThese people, they said, exceeded the ordinary human height, had\r\nflaxen hair, and blue eyes, and made an uncouth sort of noise by\r\nway of talking, having no language of their own for the purpose of\r\ncommunicating their thoughts. The rest of their information[403] was of\r\na similar nature to that communicated by our merchants. It was to the\r\neffect that the merchandize on sale was left by them upon the opposite\r\nbank of a river on their coast, and it was then removed by the natives,\r\nif they thought proper to deal on terms of exchange. On no grounds\r\nought luxury with greater reason to be detested by us, than if we only\r\ntransport our thoughts to these scenes, and then reflect, what are its\r\ndemands, to what distant spots it sends in order to satisfy them, and\r\nfor how mean and how unworthy an end!\r\n\r\nBut yet Taprobane even, isolated as it is by nature from the rest of\r\nthe world, is not exempt from our vices. Gold and silver are held in\r\nesteem even there. They have a marble which resembles tortoise-shell\r\nin appearance; this, as well as their pearls and precious stones,\r\nis highly valued; all our luxuries in fact, those even of the most\r\nexquisite nature, are there carried to the very highest pitch. They\r\nasserted that their wealth is much greater than ours, but admitted that\r\nwe know better than they how to obtain real enjoyment from opulence.\r\n\r\nIn this island no slavery exists; they do not prolong their sleep to\r\nday-break, nor indeed during any part of the day; their buildings are\r\nonly of a moderate height from the ground; the price of corn is always\r\nthe same; they have no courts of law and no litigation. Hercules is the\r\ndeity whom they worship; and their king is chosen by the people, an\r\naged man always, distinguished for his mild and clement disposition,\r\nand without children. If after he has been elected king, he happens to\r\nbecome the father of children, his abdication is the consequence; this\r\nis done that there may be no danger of the sovereign power becoming\r\nhereditary. Thirty advisers are provided for him by the people, and it\r\nis only by the advice of the majority of them that any man is condemned\r\nto capital punishment. Even then, the person so condemned has a right\r\nof appealing to the people, in which case a jury consisting of seventy\r\npersons is appointed. Should these acquit the accused, the thirty\r\ncounsellors are no longer held in any estimation, but are visited with\r\nthe greatest disgrace. The king wears the costume of Father Liber,[404]\r\nwhile the rest of the people dress like the natives of Arabia. The\r\nking, if he is found guilty of any offence, is condemned to death;\r\nbut no one slays him; all turn their backs upon him, and refuse to\r\nhold any communication or even discourse with him. Their festivals\r\nare celebrated[405] with the chase, the most valued sports being the\r\npursuit of the tiger and the elephant. The lands are carefully tilled;\r\nthe vine is not cultivated there, but of other fruits there is great\r\nabundance. They take great delight in fishing, and especially in\r\ncatching turtles; beneath the shells[406] of which whole families find\r\nan abode, of such vast size are they to be found. These people look\r\nupon a hundred years as a comparatively short life. Thus much have we\r\nlearned respecting Taprobane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—THE ARIANI AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to give some further particulars relative to the\r\nfour Satrapies, of which we have postponed further mention[407] till\r\nthe present occasion.\r\n\r\n(23). After passing the nations in the vicinity of the Indus, we\r\ncome to the mountain districts. The territory of Capisene formerly\r\nhad a city, called Capisa,[408] which was destroyed by Cyrus.\r\nArachosia[409] has a river and a city of the same name; the city\r\nwas built by Semiramis; by some writers it is called Cophen. The\r\nriver Erymanthus[410] flows past Parabeste,[411] which belongs to\r\nthe Arachosii. Writers make the Dexendrusi come next, forming the\r\nboundary of the Arachotæ on the southern side, and of the Paropanisadæ\r\non the north. The city of Cartana[412] lies at the foot of Caucasus;\r\nin later times it has been called Tetragonis.[413] This region lies\r\nover against that of the Bactri, who come next, and whose chief city\r\nis Alexandria,[414] so called from the name of its founder. We then\r\ncome to the Syndraci,[415] the Dangalæ,[416] the Parapinæ,[417]\r\nthe Catuces, and the Mazi: and then at the foot of Caucasus, to the\r\nCadrusi, whose town[418] was built by Alexander.\r\n\r\nBelow all these countries, is the line of coast which we come to\r\nafter leaving the Indus. Ariana[419] is a region parched by the\r\nsun and surrounded by deserts; still, however, as the face of the\r\ncountry is every here and there diversified with well-shaded spots,\r\nit finds communities grouped together to cultivate it, and more\r\nespecially around the two rivers, known as the Tonberos[420] and the\r\nArosapes.[421] There is also the town of Artacoana,[422] and the\r\nriver Arius,[423] which flows past Alexandria,[424] a city founded by\r\nAlexander; this place is thirty stadia in extent. Much more beautiful\r\nthan it, as well as of much greater antiquity, is Artacabane,[425]\r\nfortified a second time by Antiochus, and fifty stadia in breadth.\r\nWe then come to the nation of the Dorisdorsigi, and the rivers\r\nPharnaracotis,[426] and Ophradus; and then to Prophthasia,[427] a city\r\nof the Zaraspades, the Drangæ,[428] the Evergetæ,[429] the Zarangæ,\r\nand the Gedrusi;[430] the towns of Pucolis, Lyphorta, the desert of\r\nthe Methorgi,[431] the river Manais,[432] the nation of the Acutri,\r\nthe river Eorum, the nation of the Orbi, the Pomanus, a navigable\r\nriver in the territories of the Pandares, the Apirus in the country of\r\nthe Suari, with a good harbour at its mouth, the city of Condigramma,\r\nand the river Cophes;[433] into which last flow the navigable streams\r\nof the Saddaros,[434] the Parospus, and the Sodanus. Some writers\r\nwill also have it that Daritis[435] forms part of Ariana, and give\r\nthe length of them both as nineteen hundred and fifty miles, and the\r\nbreadth one half of that[436] of India. Others again have spread the\r\nGedrusi and the Pasires over an extent of one hundred and thirty-eight\r\nmiles, and place next to them the Ichthyophagi Oritæ,[437] a people who\r\nspeak a language peculiar to themselves, and not the Indian dialect,\r\nextending over a space of two hundred miles. Alexander forbade the\r\nwhole of the Ichthyophagi[438] to live any longer on fish. Next after\r\nthese the writers have placed extensive deserts, and then Carmania,\r\nPersia, and Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—VOYAGES TO INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut before we enter into any details respecting these countries, it\r\nwill be as well to mention what Onesicritus[439] has stated, who\r\ncommanded the fleet of Alexander, and sailed from India[440] into the\r\nheart of Persia, and what has been more recently related by Juba;\r\nafter which I shall speak of the route along these seas which has been\r\ndiscovered in later years and is followed at the present day. The\r\njournal of the voyage of Onesicritus and Nearchus has neither the names\r\nof the stations, nor yet the distances set down in it; and, first of\r\nall, it is not sufficiently explained where Xylenepolis was, and near\r\nwhat river, a place founded by Alexander, and from which, upon setting\r\nout, they took their departure. Still, however, the following places\r\nare mentioned by them, which are worthy of our notice. The town of\r\nArbis, founded by Nearchus on the occasion of this voyage; the river\r\nNabrus,[441] navigable for vessels, and opposite to it an island, at\r\na distance of seventy stadia; Alexandria, built by Leonnatus[442] by\r\norder of Alexander in the territories of this people; Argenus, with a\r\nvery convenient harbour; the river Tonberos,[443] a navigable stream,\r\naround whose banks are the Pasiræ; then come the Ichthyophagi, who\r\nextend over so large a tract of coast that it took thirty days[444]\r\nto sail past their territory; and an island known by the names of the\r\n“Island of the Sun”[445] and the “Bed of the Nymphs,” the earth of\r\nwhich is red, and in which every animal instantly dies; the cause of\r\nwhich, however, has not been ascertained.[446] Next to these is the\r\nnation of the Ori, and then the Hyctanis,[447] a river of Carmania,\r\nwith an excellent harbour at its mouth, and producing gold; at this\r\nspot the writers state that for the first time they caught sight of the\r\nGreat Bear.[448] The star Arcturus too, they tell us, was not to be\r\nseen here every night, and never, when it was seen, during the whole of\r\nit. Up to this spot extended the empire of the Achæmenidæ,[449] and in\r\nthese districts are to be found mines of copper, iron, arsenic, and red\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nThey next came to the Promontory of Carmania,[450] from which the\r\ndistance across to the opposite coast, where the Macæ, a nation of\r\nArabia, dwell, is fifty miles; and then to three islands, of which that\r\nof Oracla[451] is alone inhabited, being the only one supplied with\r\nfresh water; it is distant from the mainland twenty-five miles; quite\r\nin the Gulf, and facing Persia, there are four other islands. About\r\nthese islands sea-serpents[452] were seen swimming towards them, twenty\r\ncubits in length, which struck the fleet with great alarm. They then\r\ncame to the island of Athothradus, and those called the Gauratæ, upon\r\nwhich dwells the nation of the Gyani; the river Hyperis,[453] which\r\ndischarges itself midway into the Persian Gulf, and is navigable for\r\nmerchant ships; the river Sitiogagus, from which to Pasargadæ[454] is\r\nseven days’ sail; a navigable river known as the Phristimus, and an\r\nisland without a name; and then the river Granis,[455] navigable for\r\nvessels of small burden, and flowing through Susiane; the Deximontani,\r\na people who manufacture bitumen, dwell on its right bank. The river\r\nZarotis comes next, difficult of entrance at its mouth, except by those\r\nwho are well acquainted with it; and then two small islands; after\r\nwhich the fleet sailed through shallows which looked very much like a\r\nmarsh, but were rendered navigable by certain channels which had been\r\ncut there. They then arrived at the mouth of the Euphrates, and from\r\nthence passed into a lake which is formed by the rivers Eulæus[456] and\r\nTigris, in the vicinity of Charax,[457] after which they arrived at\r\nSusa,[458] on the river Tigris. Here, after a voyage of three months,\r\nthey found Alexander celebrating a festival, seven months after he had\r\nleft them at Patale.[459] Such was the voyage performed by the fleet of\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nIn later times it has been considered a well-ascertained fact that the\r\nvoyage from Syagrus,[460] the Promontory of Arabia, to Patale, reckoned\r\nat thirteen hundred and thirty-five miles, can be performed most\r\nadvantageously with the aid of a westerly wind, which is there known\r\nby the name of Hippalus.\r\n\r\nThe age that followed pointed out a shorter route, and a safer one, to\r\nthose who might happen to sail from the same promontory for Sigerus, a\r\nport of India; and for a long time this route was followed, until at\r\nlast a still shorter cut was discovered by a merchant, and the thirst\r\nfor gain brought India even still nearer to us. At the present day\r\nvoyages are made to India every year: and companies of archers are\r\ncarried on board the vessels, as those seas are greatly infested with\r\npirates.\r\n\r\nIt will not be amiss too, on the present occasion, to set forth the\r\nwhole of the route from Egypt, which has been stated to us of late,\r\nupon information on which reliance may be placed, and is here published\r\nfor the first time. The subject is one well worthy of our notice,\r\nseeing that in no year does India drain our empire of less than five\r\nhundred and fifty millions[461] of sesterces, giving back her own wares\r\nin exchange, which are sold among us at fully one hundred times their\r\nprime cost.\r\n\r\nTwo miles distant from Alexandria is the town of Juliopolis.[462] The\r\ndistance thence to Coptos, up the Nile, is three hundred and eight\r\nmiles; the voyage is performed, when the Etesian winds are blowing, in\r\ntwelve days. From Coptos the journey is made with the aid of camels,\r\nstations being arranged at intervals for the supply of fresh water. The\r\nfirst of these stations is called Hydreuma,[463] and is distant[464]\r\ntwenty-two miles; the second is situate on a mountain, at a distance of\r\none day’s journey from the last; the third is at a second Hydreuma,\r\ndistant from Coptos ninety-five miles; the fourth is on a mountain; the\r\nnext to that is at another Hydreuma, that of Apollo, and is distant\r\nfrom Coptos one hundred and eighty-four miles; after which, there is\r\nanother on a mountain. There is then another station at a place called\r\nthe New Hydreuma, distant from Coptos two hundred and thirty miles:\r\nand next to it there is another, called the Old Hydreuma, or the\r\nTroglodytic, where a detachment is always on guard, with a caravansary\r\nthat affords lodging for two thousand persons. This last is distant\r\nfrom the New Hydreuma seven miles. After leaving it we come to the city\r\nof Berenice,[465] situate upon a harbour of the Red Sea, and distant\r\nfrom Coptos two hundred and fifty-seven miles. The greater part of this\r\ndistance is generally travelled by night, on account of the extreme\r\nheat, the day being spent at the stations; in consequence of which it\r\ntakes twelve days to perform the whole journey from Coptos to Berenice.\r\n\r\nPassengers generally set sail at midsummer, before the rising of the\r\nDog-star, or else immediately after, and in about thirty days arrive\r\nat Ocelis[466] in Arabia, or else at Cane,[467] in the region which\r\nbears frankincense. There is also a third port of Arabia, Muza[468] by\r\nname; it is not, however, used by persons on their passage to India,\r\nas only those touch at it who deal in incense and the perfumes of\r\nArabia. More in the interior there is a city; the residence of the king\r\nthere is called Sapphar,[469] and there is another city known by the\r\nname of Save. To those who are bound for India, Ocelis is the best\r\nplace for embarcation. If the wind, called Hippalus,[470] happens to\r\nbe blowing, it is possible to arrive in forty days at the nearest mart\r\nof India, Muziris[471] by name. This, however, is not a very desirable\r\nplace for disembarcation, on account of the pirates which frequent its\r\nvicinity, where they occupy a place called Nitrias; nor, in fact, is\r\nit very rich in articles of merchandize. Besides, the road-stead for\r\nshipping is a considerable distance from the shore, and the cargoes\r\nhave to be conveyed in boats, either for loading or discharging. At\r\nthe moment that I am writing these pages, the name of the king of this\r\nplace is Cælobothras. Another port, and a much more convenient one, is\r\nthat which lies in the territory of the people called Neacyndi, Barace\r\nby name. Here king Pandion used to reign, dwelling at a considerable\r\ndistance from the mart in the interior, at a city known as Modiera.\r\nThe district from which pepper is carried down to Barace in boats\r\nhollowed out of a single tree,[472] is known as Cottonara.[473] None\r\nof these names of nations, ports, and cities are to be found in any of\r\nthe former writers, from which circumstance it would appear that the\r\nlocalities have since changed their names. Travellers set sail from\r\nIndia on their return to Europe, at the beginning of the Egyptian month\r\nTybis, which is our December, or at all events before the sixth day of\r\nthe Egyptian month Mechir, the same as[474] our ides of January: if\r\nthey do this, they can go and return in the same year. They set sail\r\nfrom India with a south-east wind, and upon entering the Red Sea, catch\r\nthe south-west or south. We will now return to our main subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—CARMANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearchus states in his writings that the coast of Carmania[475] extends\r\na distance of twelve hundred and fifty miles. From its frontier to\r\nthe river Sabis[476] is one hundred miles. At this spot begins the\r\ncultivation of the vine; which with the tillage of the fields, extends\r\nas far as the river Ananis,[477] a distance of twenty-five miles. This\r\nregion is known by the name of Armuzia. The cities of Carmania are\r\nZetis and Alexandria.[478]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—THE PERSIAN AND THE ARABIAN GULFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea then makes a two-fold indentation[479] in the land upon\r\nthese coasts, under the name of Rubrum[480] or “Red,” given to it by\r\nour countrymen; while the Greeks have called it Erythrum, from king\r\nErythras,[481] or, according to some writers, from its red colour,\r\nwhich they think is produced by the reflection of the sun’s rays;\r\nothers again are of opinion that it arises from the sand and the\r\ncomplexion of the soil, others from some peculiarity in the nature of\r\nthe water. (24.) Be this as it may, this body of water is divided into\r\ntwo gulfs. The one which lies to the east is called the Persian Gulf,\r\nand is two thousand five hundred miles in circumference, according\r\nto Eratosthenes. Opposite to it lies Arabia, the length of which is\r\nfifteen hundred miles. On the other side again, Arabia is bounded\r\nby the Arabian Gulf. The sea as it enters this gulf is called the\r\nAzanian[482] Sea. The Persian Gulf, at the entrance, is only five[483]\r\nmiles wide; some writers make it four. From the entrance to the very\r\nbottom of the gulf, in a straight line, has been ascertained to be\r\nnearly eleven hundred and twenty-five miles: in outline it strongly\r\nresembles[484] the human head. Onesicritus and Nearchus have stated\r\nin their works that from the river Indus to the Persian Gulf, and\r\nfrom thence to Babylon, situate in the marshes of the Euphrates, is a\r\ndistance of seventeen hundred miles.\r\n\r\nIn the angle of Carmania are the Chelonophagi,[485] who cover their\r\ncabins with the shells of turtles, and live upon their flesh; these\r\npeople inhabit the next promontory that is seen after leaving the river\r\nArbis;[486] with the exception of the head, they are covered all over\r\nwith long hair, and are clothed in the skins of fishes.\r\n\r\n(25.) Beyond their district, in the direction of India, is said to\r\nbe the desert island of Caicandrus, fifty miles out at sea; near to\r\nwhich, with a strait flowing between them, is Stoidis, celebrated\r\nfor its valuable pearls. After passing the promontory[487] are the\r\nArmozei,[488] joining up to the Carmani; some writers, however, place\r\nbetween them the Arbii,[489] extending along the shore a distance\r\nof four hundred and twenty-one miles. Here is a place called Portus\r\nMacedonum,[490] and the Altars of Alexander, situate on a promontory,\r\nbesides the rivers Saganos, Daras, and Salsa. Beyond the last river we\r\ncome to the promontory of Themisteas, and the island of Aphrodisias,\r\nwhich is peopled. Here Persis begins, at the river Oratis,[491] which\r\nseparates it from Elymais.[492] Opposite to the coast of Persis, are\r\nthe islands of Psilos, Cassandra, and Aracia, the last sacred to\r\nNeptune,[493] and containing a mountain of great height. Persis[494]\r\nitself, looking towards the west, has a line of coast five hundred and\r\nfifty miles in length; it is a country opulent even to luxury, but has\r\nlong since changed its name for that of “Parthia.”[495] I shall now\r\ndevote a few words to the Parthian empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—THE PARTHIAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kingdoms[496] of Parthia are eighteen in all: such being the\r\ndivisions of its provinces, which lie, as we have already stated,\r\nalong the Red Sea to the south, and the Hyrcanian to the north. Of\r\nthis number the eleven, called the Higher provinces, begin at the\r\nfrontiers of Armenia and the shores of the Caspian, and extend to the\r\nScythians, whose mode of life is similar in every respect. The other\r\nseven kingdoms of Parthia bear the name of the Lower provinces. As\r\nto the Parthi themselves, Parthia[497] always lay at the foot of the\r\nmountains[498] so often mentioned, which overhang all these nations.\r\nOn the east it is bounded by the Arii, on the south by Carmania and\r\nthe Ariani, on the west by the Pratitæ, a people of the Medi, and on\r\nthe north by the Hyrcani: it is surrounded by deserts on every side.\r\nThe more distant of the Parthi are called Nomades;[499] on this side\r\nof them there are deserts. On the west are the cities of Issatis and\r\nCalliope, already mentioned,[500] on the north-east Europus,[501]\r\non the south-east Maria; in the middle there are Hecatompylos,[502]\r\nArsace, and Nisiæa, a fine district of Parthiene, in which is\r\nAlexandropolis, so called from its founder.\r\n\r\n(26.) It is requisite in this place to trace the localities of the\r\nMedi also, and to describe in succession the features of the country\r\nas far as the Persian Sea, in order that the account which follows\r\nmay be the better understood. Media[503] lies crosswise to the west,\r\nand so presenting itself obliquely to Parthia, closes the entrance\r\nof both kingdoms[504] into which it is divided. It has, then, on the\r\neast, the Caspii and the Parthi; on the south, Sittacene, Susiane, and\r\nPersis; on the west, Adsiabene; and on the north, Armenia. The Persæ\r\nhave always inhabited the shores of the Red Sea, for which reason it\r\nhas received the name of the Persian Gulf. This maritime region of\r\nPersis has the name of Ciribo;[505] on the side on which it runs up\r\nto that of the Medi, there is a place known by the name of Climax\r\nMegale,[506] where the mountains are ascended by a steep flight of\r\nstairs, and so afford a narrow passage which leads to Persepolis,[507]\r\nthe former capital of the kingdom, destroyed by Alexander. It has\r\nalso, at its extreme frontier, Laodicea,[508] founded by Antiochus.\r\nTo the east of this place is the fortress of Passagarda,[509] held by\r\nthe Magi, at which spot is the tomb of Cyrus; also Ecbatana,[510] a\r\ncity of theirs, the inhabitants of which were removed by Darius to the\r\nmountains. Between the Parthi and the Ariani projects the territory\r\nof the Parætaceni.[511] By these nations and the river Euphrates are\r\nthe Lower kingdoms of Parthia bounded; of the others we shall speak\r\nafter Mesopotamia, which we shall now describe, with the exception of\r\nthat angle of it and the peoples of Arabia, which have been already\r\nmentioned in a former book.[512]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—MESOPOTAMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of Mesopotamia formerly belonged to the Assyrians, being\r\ncovered with nothing but villages, with the exception of Babylonia[513]\r\nand Ninus.[514] The Macedonians formed these communities into\r\ncities, being prompted thereto by the extraordinary fertility of\r\nthe soil. Besides the cities already mentioned, it contains those\r\nof Seleucia,[515] Laodicea,[516] Artemita;[517] and in Arabia, the\r\npeoples known as the Orei[518] and the Mardani, besides Antiochia,[519]\r\nfounded by Nicanor, the governor of Mesopotamia, and called Arabis.\r\nJoining up to these in the interior is an Arabian people, called the\r\nEldamani, and above them, upon the river Pallaconta, the town of Bura,\r\nand the Arabian peoples known as the Salmani and the Masei. Up to the\r\nGordyæi[520] join the Aloni, through whose territory runs the river\r\nZerbis, which falls into the Tigris; next are the Azones, the Silici,\r\na mountain tribe, and the Orontes, to the west of whom lies the town\r\nof Gaugamela,[521] as also Suë, situate upon the rocks. Beyond these\r\nare the Silici, surnamed Classitæ, through whose district runs the\r\nriver Lycus on its passage from Armenia, the Absithris[522] running\r\nsouth-east, the town of Accobis, and then in the plains the towns\r\nof Diospage, Polytelia,[523] Stratonice, and Anthermis.[524] In the\r\nvicinity of the Euphrates is Nicephorion, of which we have[525] already\r\nstated that Alexander, struck with the favourable situation of the\r\nspot, ordered it to be built. We have also similarly made mention[526]\r\nof Apamea on the Zeugma. Leaving that city and going eastward, we come\r\nto Caphrena, a fortified town, formerly seventy stadia in extent,\r\nand called the “Court of the Satraps.” It was to this place that the\r\ntribute was conveyed; now it is reduced to a mere fortress. Thæbata is\r\nstill in the same state as formerly: after which comes Oruros, which\r\nunder Pompeius Magnus formed the extreme limit of the Roman Empire,\r\ndistant from Zeugma two hundred and fifty miles. There are writers\r\nwho say that the Euphrates was drawn off by an artificial channel by\r\nthe governor Gobares, at the point where we have stated[527] that it\r\nbranches off,[528] in order that it might not commit damage in the city\r\nof Babylonia, in consequence of the extreme rapidity of its course. The\r\nAssyrians universally call this river by the name of Narmalcha,[529]\r\nwhich signifies the “royal river.” At the point where its waters\r\ndivide, there was in former times a very large city, called Agranis,\r\nwhich the Persæ have destroyed.\r\n\r\nBabylon, the capital of the nations of Chaldæa, long enjoyed the\r\ngreatest celebrity of all cities throughout the whole world: and it is\r\nfrom this place that the remaining parts of Mesopotamia and Assyria\r\nreceived the name of Babylonia. The circuit of its walls, which were\r\ntwo hundred feet in height, was sixty miles. These walls were also\r\nfifty feet in breadth, reckoning to every foot three fingers’ breadth\r\nbeyond the ordinary measure of our foot. The river Euphrates flowed\r\nthrough the city, with quays of marvellous workmanship erected on\r\neither side. The temple there[530] of Jupiter Belus[531] is still in\r\nexistence; he was the first inventor of the science of Astronomy. In\r\nall other respects it has been reduced to a desert, having been drained\r\nof its population in consequence of its vicinity to Seleucia,[532]\r\nfounded for that purpose by Nicator, at a distance of ninety miles,\r\non the confluence of the Tigris and the canal that leads from the\r\nEuphrates. Seleucia, however, still bears the surname of Babylonia:\r\nit is a free and independent city, and retains the features of the\r\nMacedonian manners. It is said that the population of this city amounts\r\nto six hundred thousand, and that the outline of its walls resembles an\r\neagle with expanded wings: its territory, they say, is the most fertile\r\nin all the East. The Parthi again, in its turn, founded Ctesiphon,[533]\r\nfor the purpose of drawing away the population of Seleucia, at a\r\ndistance of nearly three miles, and in the district of Chalonitis;\r\nCtesiphon is now the capital of all the Parthian kingdoms. Finding,\r\nhowever, that this city did not answer the intended purpose, king\r\nVologesus[534] has of late years founded another city in its vicinity,\r\nVologesocerta[535] by name. Besides the above, there are still the\r\nfollowing towns in Mesopotamia: Hipparenum,[536] rendered famous,\r\nlike Babylon, by the learning of the Chaldæi, and situate near the\r\nriver Narraga,[537] which falls into the Narroga, from which a city so\r\ncalled has taken its name. The Persæ destroyed the walls of Hipparenum.\r\nOrchenus also, a third place of learning of the Chaldæi, is situate in\r\nthe same district, towards the south; after which come the Notitæ, the\r\nOrothophanitæ, and the Grecichartæ.[538] From Nearchus and Onesicritus\r\nwe learn that the distance by water from the Persian Sea to Babylon,\r\nup the Euphrates, is four hundred and twelve miles; other authors,\r\nhowever, who have written since their time, say that the distance\r\nto Seleucia is four hundred and forty miles: and Juba says that the\r\ndistance from Babylon to Charax is one hundred and seventy-five. Some\r\nwriters state that the Euphrates continues to flow with an undivided\r\nchannel for a distance of eighty-seven miles beyond Babylon, before its\r\nwaters are diverted from their channel for the purposes of irrigation;\r\nand that the whole length of its course is not less than twelve hundred\r\nmiles. The circumstance that so many different authors have treated\r\nof this subject, accounts for all these variations, seeing that even\r\nthe Persian writers themselves do not agree as to what is the length\r\nof their _schæni_ and _parasangæ_, each assigning to them a different\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nWhen the Euphrates ceases, by running in its channel, to afford\r\nprotection[539] to those who dwell on its banks, which it does when it\r\napproaches the confines of Charax, the country is immediately infested\r\nby the Attali, a predatory people of Arabia, beyond whom are found the\r\nScenitæ.[540] The banks along this river are occupied by the Nomades of\r\nArabia, as far as the deserts of Syria, from which, as we have already\r\nstated,[541] it takes a turn to the south,[542] and leaves the solitary\r\ndeserts of Palmyra. Seleucia is distant, by way of the Euphrates, from\r\nthe beginning of Mesopotamia, eleven hundred and twenty-five; from\r\nthe Red Sea, by way of the Tigris, two hundred and twenty; and from\r\nZeugma, seven hundred and twenty-three, miles. Zeugma is distant from\r\nSeleucia[543] in Syria, on the shores of our sea, one hundred and\r\nseventy-five[544] miles. Such is the extent of the land that lies in\r\nthese parts between the two seas.[545] The length of the kingdom of\r\nParthia is nine hundred and eighteen miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—THE TIGRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, besides the above, another town in Mesopotamia, on the\r\nbanks of the Tigris and near its confluence with the Euphrates, the\r\nname of which is Digba.[546] (27.) But it will be as well now to give\r\nsome particulars respecting the Tigris itself. This river rises in\r\nthe region of Greater Armenia,[547] from a very remarkable source,\r\nsituate on a plain. The name of the spot is Elegosine,[548] and the\r\nstream, as soon as it begins to flow, though with a slow current,\r\nhas the name of Diglito.[549] When its course becomes more rapid,\r\nit assumes the name of Tigris,[550] given to it on account of its\r\nswiftness, that word signifying an arrow in the Median language. It\r\nthen flows into Lake Arethusa,[551] the waters of which are able to\r\nsupport all weighty substances thrown into them, and exhale nitrous\r\nvapours. This lake produces only one kind of fish, which, however,\r\nnever enter the current of the river in its passage through the lake:\r\nand in a similar manner, the fish of the Tigris will never swim out\r\nof its stream into the waters of the lake. Distinguishable from the\r\nlake, both by the rapidity and the colour of its waters, the tide of\r\nthe river is hurried along; after it has passed through and arrived\r\nat Mount Taurus, it disappears[552] in a cavern of that mountain, and\r\npassing beneath it, bursts forth on the other side; the spot bears\r\nthe name of Zoroande.[553] That the waters on either side of the\r\nmountain are the same, is evident from the fact, that bodies thrown\r\nin on the one side will reappear on the other. It then passes through\r\nanother lake, called Thospites, and once more burying itself in the\r\nearth, reappears, after running a distance of twenty-two miles, in\r\nthe vicinity of Nymphæum.[554] Claudius Cæsar informs us that, in the\r\ndistrict of Arrene[555] it flows so near to the river Arsanias,[556]\r\nthat when their waters swell they meet and flow together, but without,\r\nhowever, intermingling. For those of the Arsani, as he says, being\r\nlighter, float on the surface of the Tigris for a distance of nearly\r\nfour miles, after which they separate, and the Arsanias flows into the\r\nEuphrates. The Tigris, after flowing through Armenia and receiving\r\nthe well-known rivers Parthenias and Nicephorion, separates the\r\nArabian Orei[557] from the Adiabeni, and then forms by its course, as\r\npreviously mentioned, the country of Mesopotamia. After traversing the\r\nmountains of the Gordyæi,[558] it passes round Apamea,[559] a town of\r\nMesene, one hundred and twenty-five miles on this side of Babylonian\r\nSeleucia, and then divides into two channels, one[560] of which runs\r\nsouthward, and flowing through Mesene, runs towards Seleucia, while the\r\nother takes a turn to the north and passes through the plains of the\r\nCauchæ,[561] at the back of the district of Mesene. When the waters\r\nhave reunited, the river assumes the name of Pasitigris. After this,\r\nit receives the Choaspes,[562] which comes from Media; and then, as\r\nwe have already stated,[563] flowing between Seleucia and Ctesiphon,\r\ndischarges itself into the Chaldæan Lakes, which it supplies for a\r\ndistance of seventy miles. Escaping from them by a vast channel, it\r\npasses the city of Charax to the right, and empties itself into the\r\nPersian Sea, being ten miles in width at the mouth. Between the mouths\r\nof the two rivers Tigris and the Euphrates, the distance was formerly\r\ntwenty-five, or, according to some writers, seven miles only, both of\r\nthem being navigable to the sea. But the Orcheni and others who dwell\r\non its banks, have long since dammed up the waters of the Euphrates for\r\nthe purposes of irrigation, and it can only discharge itself into the\r\nsea by the aid of the Tigris.\r\n\r\nThe country on the banks of the Tigris is called Parapotamia;[564]\r\nwe have already made mention of Mesene, one of its districts.\r\nDabithac[565] is a town there, adjoining to which is the district\r\nof Chalonitis, with the city of Ctesiphon,[566] famous, not only for\r\nits palm-groves, but for its olives, fruits, and other shrubs. Mount\r\nZagrus[567] reaches as far as this district, and extends from Armenia\r\nbetween the Medi and the Adiabeni; above Parætacene and Persis.\r\nChalonitis[568] is distant from Persis three hundred and eighty miles;\r\nsome writers say that by the shortest route it is the same distance\r\nfrom Assyria and the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nBetween these peoples and Mesene is Sittacene, which is also called\r\nArbelitis[569] and Palæstine. Its city of Sittace[570] is of Greek\r\norigin; this and Sabdata[571] lie to the east, and on the west is\r\nAntiochia,[572] between the two rivers Tigris and Tornadotus,[573] as\r\nalso Apamea,[574] to which Antiochus[575] gave this name, being that\r\nof his mother. The Tigris surrounds this city, which is also traversed\r\nby the waters of the Archoüs. Below[576] this district is Susiane,\r\nin which is the city of Susa,[577] the ancient residence of the kings\r\nof Persia, built by Darius, the son of Hystaspes; it is distant from\r\nSeleucia Babylonia four hundred and fifty miles, and the same from\r\nEcbatana of the Medi, by way of Mount Carbantus.[578] Upon the northern\r\nchannel of the river Tigris is the town of Babytace,[579] distant from\r\nSusa one hundred and thirty-five miles. Here, for the only place in all\r\nthe world, is gold held in abhorrence; the people collect it together\r\nand bury it in the earth, that it may be of use to no one.[580] On the\r\neast of Susiane are the Oxii, a predatory people, and forty independent\r\nsavage tribes of the Mizæi. Above these are the Mardi and the Saitæ,\r\nsubject to Parthia: they extend above the district of Elymais, which\r\nwe have already mentioned[581] as joining up to the coast of Persis.\r\nSusa is distant two hundred and fifty miles from the Persian Sea. Near\r\nthe spot where the fleet of Alexander came up[582] the Pasitigris to\r\nSusa, there is a village situate on the Chaldæan Lake, Aple by name,\r\nfrom which to Susa is a distance of sixty miles and a half. Adjoining\r\nto the people of Susiane, on the east, are the Cossiæi;[583] and\r\nabove them, to the north, is Mesabatene, lying at the foot of Mount\r\nCambalidus,[584] a branch of the Caucasian chain: from this point the\r\ncountry of the Bactri is most accessible.\r\n\r\nSusiane is separated from Elymais by the river Eulæus, which rises in\r\nMedia, and, after concealing itself in the earth for a short distance,\r\nrises again and flows through Mesabatene. It then flows round the\r\ncitadel of Susa[585] and the temple of Diana, which is held in the\r\nhighest veneration by all these nations; the river itself being the\r\nobject of many pompous ceremonials; the kings, indeed, will drink of\r\nno other water,[586] and for that reason carry it with them on their\r\njournies to any considerable distance. This river receives the waters\r\nof the Hedypnos,[587] which passes Asylus, in Persis, and those of the\r\nAduna, which rises in Susiane. Magoa[588] is a town situate near it,\r\nand distant from Charax fifteen miles; some writers place this town at\r\nthe very extremity of Susiane, and close to the deserts.\r\n\r\nBelow the Eulæus is Elymais,[589] upon the coast adjoining to Persis,\r\nand extending from the river Orates[590] to Charax, a distance of two\r\nhundred and forty miles. Its towns are Seleucia[591] and Socrate,[592]\r\nupon Mount Casyrus. The shore which lies in front of this district\r\nis, as we have already stated, rendered inaccessible by mud,[593] the\r\nrivers Brixa and Ortacea bringing down vast quantities of slime from\r\nthe interior,—Elymais itself being so marshy that it is impossible to\r\nreach Persis that way, unless by going completely round: it is also\r\ngreatly infested with serpents, which are brought down by the waters\r\nof these rivers. That part of it which is the most inaccessible of\r\nall, bears the name of Characene, from Charax,[594] the frontier city\r\nof the kingdoms of Arabia. Of this place we will now make mention,\r\nafter first stating the opinions of M. Agrippa in relation to this\r\nsubject. That author informs us that Media, Parthia, and Persis, are\r\nbounded on the east by the Indus, on the west by the Tigris, on the\r\nnorth by Taurus and Caucasus, and on the south by the Red Sea; that the\r\nlength of these countries is thirteen hundred and twenty miles, and\r\nthe breadth eight hundred and forty; and that, in addition to these,\r\nthere is Mesopotamia, which, taken by itself, is bounded on the east by\r\nthe Tigris, on the west by the Euphrates, on the north by the chain of\r\nTaurus, and on the south by the Persian Sea, being eight hundred miles\r\nin length, and three hundred and sixty in breadth.\r\n\r\nCharax is a city situate at the furthest extremity of the Arabian\r\nGulf, at which begins the more prominent portion of Arabia Felix:[595]\r\nit is built on an artificial elevation, having the Tigris on the\r\nright, and the Eulæus on the left, and lies on a piece of ground three\r\nmiles in extent, just between the confluence of those streams. It was\r\nfirst founded by Alexander the Great, with colonists from the royal\r\ncity of Durine, which was then destroyed, and such of his soldiers\r\nas were invalided and left behind. By his order it was to be called\r\nAlexandria, and a borough called Pella, from his native place, was to\r\nbe peopled solely by Macedonians; the city, however, was destroyed by\r\ninundations of the rivers. Antiochus,[596] the fifth king of Syria,\r\nafterwards rebuilt this place and called it by his own name; and on\r\nits being again destroyed, Pasines, the son of Saggonadacus, and king\r\nof the neighbouring Arabians, whom Juba has incorrectly described as\r\na satrap of king Antiochus, restored it, and raised embankments for\r\nits protection, calling it after himself. These embankments extended\r\nin length a distance of nearly three miles, in breadth a little less.\r\nIt stood at first at a distance of ten stadia from the shore, and even\r\nhad a harbour[597] of its own. But according to Juba, it is fifty miles\r\nfrom the sea; and at the present day, the ambassadors from Arabia, and\r\nour own merchants who have visited the place, say that it stands at a\r\ndistance of one hundred and twenty miles from the sea-shore. Indeed,\r\nin no part of the world have alluvial deposits been formed more\r\nrapidly by the rivers, and to a greater extent than here; and it is\r\nonly a matter of surprise that the tides, which run to a considerable\r\ndistance beyond this city, do not carry them back again. At this place\r\nwas born Dionysius,[598] the most recent author of a description of the\r\nworld; he was sent by the late emperor Augustus to gather all necessary\r\ninformation in the East, when his eldest[599] son was about to set out\r\nfor Armenia to take the command against the Parthians and Arabians.\r\n\r\nThe fact has not escaped me, nor indeed have I forgotten, that at the\r\nbeginning of this work[600] I have remarked that each author appeared\r\nto be most accurate in the description of his own country; still,\r\nwhile I am speaking of these parts of the world, I prefer to follow\r\nthe discoveries made by the Roman arms, and the description given by\r\nking Juba, in his work dedicated to Caius Cæsar above-mentioned, on the\r\nsubject of the same expedition against Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (28.)—ARABIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabia, inferior to no country throughout the whole world, is of\r\nimmense extent, running downwards, as we have previously stated,[601]\r\nfrom Mount Amanus, over against Cilicia and Commagene; many of the\r\nArabian nations having been removed to those countries by Tigranes the\r\nGreat,[602] while others again have migrated of their own accord to\r\nthe shores of our sea[603] and the coast of Egypt, as we have already\r\nmentioned.[604] The Nubei[605] have even penetrated as far as Mount\r\nLibanus in the middle of Syria; in their turn they are bounded by the\r\nRamisi, these by the Taranei, and these again by the Patami.\r\n\r\nAs for Arabia itself, it is a peninsula, running out between the Red\r\nand the Persian Seas; and it is by a kind of design, apparently on\r\nthe part of nature, that it is surrounded by the sea in such a manner\r\nas to resemble very much the form and size[606] of Italy, there being\r\nno difference either in the climate of the two countries, as they lie\r\nin the same latitudes.[607] This, too, renders it equally fertile with\r\nthe countries of Italy. We have already mentioned[608] its peoples,\r\nwhich extend from our sea as far as the deserts of Palmyrene, and we\r\nshall now proceed to a description of the remainder. The Scenitæ, as\r\nwe have already stated,[609] border upon the Nomades and the tribes\r\nthat ravage the territories of Chaldæa, being themselves of wandering\r\nhabits, and receiving their name from the tents which constitute their\r\ndwellings; these are made of goats’ hair, and they pitch them wherever\r\nthey please. Next after them are the Nabatæi, who have a city called\r\nPetra,[610] which lies in a deep valley, somewhat less than two miles\r\nin width, and surrounded by inaccessible mountains, between which a\r\nriver flows: it is distant from the city of Gaza, on our shores, six\r\nhundred miles, and from the Persian Gulf one hundred and thirty-five.\r\nAt this place two roads meet, the one leading from Syria to Palmyra,\r\nand the other from Gaza. On leaving Petra we come to the Omani,[611]\r\nwho dwell as far as Charax, with their once famous cities which were\r\nbuilt by Semiramis, Besannisa and Soractia by name; at the present day\r\nthey are wildernesses. We next come to a city situate on the banks of\r\nthe Pasitigris, Fora by name, and subject to the king of Charax: to\r\nthis place people resort on their road from Petra, and sail thence to\r\nCharax, twelve miles distant, with the tide. If you are proceeding by\r\nwater from the Parthian territories, you come to a village known as\r\nTeredon; and below the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris, you have\r\nthe Chaldæi dwelling on the left side of the river, and the Nomadic\r\ntribes of the Scenitæ on the right. Some writers also make mention\r\nof two other cities situate at long intervals, as you sail along the\r\nTigris, Barbatia, and then Thumata, distant from Petra, they say, ten\r\ndays’ sail; our merchants report that these places are subject to\r\nthe king of Charax. The same writers also state, that Apamea[612] is\r\nsituate where the overflow of the Euphrates unites with the Tigris; and\r\nthat when the Parthians meditate an incursion, the inhabitants dam up\r\nthe river by embankments, and so inundate their country.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to describe the coast after leaving Charax,[613]\r\nwhich was first explored by order of king Epiphanes. We first come\r\nto the place where the mouth of the Euphrates formerly existed, the\r\nriver Salsus,[614] and the Promontory of Chaldone,[615] from which\r\nspot, the sea along the coast, for an extent of fifty miles,[616]\r\nbears more the aspect of a series of whirlpools than of ordinary sea;\r\nthe river Achenus, and then a desert tract for a space of one hundred\r\nmiles, until we come to the island of Ichara; the gulf of Capeus, on\r\nthe shores of which dwell the Gaulopes and the Chateni, and then the\r\ngulf of Gerra.[617] Here we find the city of Gerra, five miles in\r\ncircumference, with towers built of square blocks of salt. Fifty miles\r\nfrom the coast, lying in the interior, is the region of Attene, and\r\nopposite to Gerra is the island of Tylos,[618] as many miles distant\r\nfrom the shore; it is famous for the vast number of its pearls, and\r\nhas a town of the same name; in its vicinity there is a smaller\r\nisland,[619] distant from a promontory on the larger one twelve miles\r\nand a half. They say that beyond this large islands may be seen, upon\r\nwhich no one has ever landed: the circumference of the smaller island\r\nis one hundred and twelve miles and a half, and it is more than that\r\ndistance from the Persian coast, being accessible by only one narrow\r\nchannel. We then come to the island of Asclie, and the nations of the\r\nNocheti, the Zurazi, the Borgodi, the Catharrei, the Nomades, and then\r\nthe river Cynos.[620] Beyond this, the navigation is impracticable on\r\nthat side,[621] according to Juba, on account of the rocks; and he has\r\nomitted all mention of Batrasave,[622] a town of the Omani, and of the\r\ncity of Omana,[623] which former writers have made out to be a famous\r\nport of Carmania;[624] as also of Homna and Attana, towns which at the\r\npresent day, our merchants say, are by far the most famous ones in the\r\nPersian Sea. Passing the river Cynos,[625] there is a mountain, Juba\r\nsays, that bears marks of the action of fire; also, the nation of the\r\nEpimaranitæ, then a nation of Ichthyophagi, and then a desert island,\r\nand the nation of the Bathymi. We then come to the Eblitæan Mountains,\r\nthe island of Omoënus, the port of Mochorbe, the islands of Etaxalos\r\nand Inchobrice, and the nation of the Cadæi. There are many islands\r\nalso that have no name, but the better known ones are Isura, Rhinnea,\r\nand another still nearer the shore, upon which there are some stone\r\npillars with an inscription in unknown characters. There are also the\r\nport of Gobœa, the desert islands called Bragæ, the nation of the\r\nThaludæi, the region of Dabanegoris, Mount Orsa, with a harbour, the\r\ngulf of Duatus, with numerous islands, Mount Tricoryphos,[626] the\r\nregion of Cardaleon, and the islands called Solanades, Cachinna, and\r\nthat of the Ichthyophagi. We then find the Clari, the shore of Mamæum,\r\non which there are gold mines, the region of Canauna, the nations of\r\nthe Apitami and the Casani, the island of Devade, the fountain of\r\nCoralis, the Carphati, the islands of Calaëu and Amnamethus, and the\r\nnation of the Darræ. Also, the island of Chelonitis,[627] numerous\r\nislands of Ichthyophagi, the deserts of Odanda, Basa, many islands of\r\nthe Sabæi, the rivers Thanar and Amnume, the islands of Dorice, and the\r\nfountains of Daulotos and Dora. We find also the islands of Pteros,\r\nLabatanis, Coboris, and Sambrachate, with a town of the same name[628]\r\non the mainland. Lying to the south are a great number of islands,\r\nthe largest of which is Camari; also the river Musecros, and the port\r\nof Laupas. We then come to the Sabæi, a nation of Scenitæ,[629] with\r\nnumerous islands, and the city of Acila,[630] which is their mart, and\r\nfrom which persons embark for India. We next come to the region of\r\nAmithoscutta, Damnia, the Greater and the Lesser Mizi, and the Drimati.\r\nThe promontory of the Naumachæi, over against Carmania, is distant\r\nfrom it fifty miles. A wonderful circumstance is said to have happened\r\nhere; Numenius, who was made governor of Mesena by king Antiochus,\r\nwhile fighting against the Persians, defeated them at sea, and at low\r\nwater, by land, with an army of cavalry, on the same day; in memory of\r\nwhich event he erected a twofold trophy on the same spot, in honour of\r\nJupiter and Neptune.[631]\r\n\r\nOpposite to this place, in the main sea, lies the island of\r\nOgyris,[632] famous for being the burial-place of king Erythras;[633]\r\nit is distant from the mainland one hundred and twenty miles, being\r\none hundred and twelve in circumference. No less famous is another\r\nisland, called Dioscoridu,[634] and lying in the Azanian Sea;[635] it\r\nis distant two hundred and eighty miles from the extreme point of the\r\nPromontory of Syagrus.[636]\r\n\r\nThe remaining places and nations on the mainland, lying still to the\r\nsouth, are the Ausaritæ, to whose country it is seven days’ journey\r\namong the mountains, the nations of the Larendani and the Catabani,\r\nand the Gebanitæ, who occupy a great number of towns, the largest of\r\nwhich are Nagia, and Thomna with sixty-five temples, a number which\r\nfully bespeaks its size. We then come to a promontory, from which\r\nto the mainland of the Troglodytæ it is fifty miles, and then the\r\nThoani, the Actæi, the Chatramotitæ, the Tonabei, the Antidalei, the\r\nLexianæ, the Agræi, the Cerbani, and the Sabæi,[637] the best known\r\nof all the tribes of Arabia, on account of their frankincense; these\r\nnations extend from sea to sea.[638] The towns which belong to them\r\non the Red Sea are Marane, Marma, Corolia, and Sabatha; and in the\r\ninterior, Nascus, Cardava, Carnus, and Thomala, from which they bring\r\ndown their spices for exportation. One portion of this nation is the\r\nAtramitæ,[639] whose capital, Sabota, has sixty temples within its\r\nwalls. But the royal city of all these nations is Mariaba;[640] it\r\nlies upon a bay, ninety-four miles in extent, and filled with islands\r\nthat produce perfumes. Lying in the interior, and joining up to the\r\nAtramitæ, are the Minæi; the Elamitæ[641] dwell on the sea-shore, in a\r\ncity from which they take their name. Next to these are the Chaculatæ;\r\nthen the town of Sibi, by the Greeks called Apate;[642] the Arsi,\r\nthe Codani, the Vadei, who dwell in a large town, the Barasasæi, the\r\nLechieni, and the island of Sygaros,[643] into the interior of which no\r\ndogs are admitted, and so being exposed on the sea-shore, they wander\r\nabout there and are left to die. We then come to a gulf which runs far\r\ninto the interior, upon which are situate the Læenitæ, who have given\r\nto it their name; also their royal city of Agra,[644] and upon the gulf\r\nthat of Læana, or as some call it Ælana;[645] indeed, by some of our\r\nwriters this has been called the Ælanitic Gulf, and by others again,\r\nthe Ælenitic; Artemidorus calls it the Alenitic, and Juba the Lænitic.\r\nThe circumference of Arabia, measured from Charax to Læana, is said\r\nto be four thousand six hundred and sixty-six miles, but Juba thinks\r\nthat it is somewhat less than four thousand. Its widest part is at the\r\nnorth, between the cities of Heroopolis and Charax. We will now mention\r\nthe remaining places and peoples of the interior of Arabia.\r\n\r\nUp to the Nabatæi[646] the ancients joined the Thimanei; at present\r\nthey have next to them the Taveni, and then the Suelleni, the\r\nArraceni,[647] and the Areni,[648] whose town is the centre of all the\r\ncommerce of these parts. Next come the Hemnatæ, the Aualitæ, the towns\r\nof Domata and Hegra, the Tamudæi,[649] with the town of Badanatha,\r\nthe Carrei, with the town of Cariati,[650] the Achoali, with the town\r\nof Foth, and the Minæi, who derive their origin, it is supposed,[651]\r\nfrom Minos, king of Crete, and of whom the Carmæi are a tribe. Next\r\ncomes a town, fourteen miles distant, called Marippa, and belonging to\r\nthe Palamaces, a place by no means to be overlooked, and then Carnon.\r\nThe Rhadamæi also—these too are supposed to derive their origin[652]\r\nfrom Rhadamanthus, the brother of Minos—the Homeritæ,[653] with their\r\ncity of Masala,[654] the Hamirei, the Gedranitæ, the Amphyræ, the\r\nIlisanitæ, the Bachilitæ, the Samnæi, the Amitæi, with the towns of\r\nNessa[655] and Cennesseris, the Zamareni, with the towns of Sagiatta\r\nand Canthace, the Bacascami, the town of Riphearma, the name by which\r\nthey call barley, the Autei, the Ethravi, the Cyrei and the Mathatæi,\r\nthe Helmodenes, with the town of Ebode, the Agacturi, dwelling in the\r\nmountains, with a town twenty miles distant, in which is a fountain\r\ncalled Ænuscabales,[656] which signifies “the town of the camels.”\r\nAmpelome[657] also, a Milesian colony, the town of Athrida, the\r\nCalingii, whose city is called Mariva,[658] and signifies “the lord\r\nof all men;” the towns of Palon and Murannimal, near a river by which\r\nit is thought that the Euphrates discharges itself, the nations of\r\nthe Agrei and the Ammonii, the town of Athenæ, the Caunaravi, a name\r\nwhich signifies “most rich in herds,” the Coranitæ, the Œsani, and\r\nthe Choani.[659] Here were also formerly the Greek towns of Arethusa,\r\nLarisa, and Chalcis, which have been destroyed in various wars.\r\n\r\nÆlius Gallus,[660] a member of the Equestrian order, is the sole person\r\nwho has hitherto carried the Roman arms into these lands, for Caius\r\nCæsar, the son[661] of Augustus, only had a distant view of Arabia.\r\nIn his expedition, Gallus destroyed the following towns, the names of\r\nwhich are not given by the authors who had written before his time,\r\nNegrana, Nestum, Nesca, Masugum, Caminacum, Labecia, and Mariva[662]\r\nabove-mentioned, six miles in circumference, as also Caripeta, the\r\nfurthest point of his expedition. He brought back with him the\r\nfollowing discoveries—that the Nomades[663] live upon milk and the\r\nflesh of wild beasts, and that the other nations, like the Indians,\r\nextract a sort of wine from the palm-tree, and oil from sesame.[664]\r\nHe says that the most numerous of these tribes are the Homeritæ and\r\nthe Minæi, that their lands are fruitful in palms and shrubs, and that\r\ntheir chief wealth is centred in their flocks. We also learn from the\r\nsame source that the Cerbani and the Agræi excel in arms, but more\r\nparticularly the Chatramotitæ;[665] that the territories of the Carrei\r\nare the most extensive and most fertile; but that the Sabæi are the\r\nrichest of all in the great abundance of their spice-bearing groves,\r\ntheir mines of gold,[666] their streams for irrigation, and their\r\nample produce of honey and wax. Of their perfumes we shall have to\r\ntreat more at large in the Book devoted to that subject.[667] The Arabs\r\neither wear the mitra,[668] or else go with their hair unshorn, while\r\nthe beard is shaved, except upon the upper lip: some tribes, however,\r\nleave even the beard unshaved. A singular thing too, one half of these\r\nalmost innumerable tribes live by the pursuits of commerce, the other\r\nhalf by rapine: take them all in all, they are the richest nations in\r\nthe world, seeing that such vast wealth flows in upon them from both\r\nthe Roman and the Parthian Empires; for they sell the produce of the\r\nsea or of their forests, while they purchase nothing whatever in return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—THE GULFS OF THE RED SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now trace the rest of the coast that lies opposite to that\r\nof Arabia. Timosthenes has estimated the length of the whole gulf at\r\nfour days’ sail, and the breadth at two, making the Straits[669] to\r\nbe seven miles and a half in width. Eratosthenes says that the length\r\nof the shore from the mouth of the gulf is thirteen hundred miles on\r\neach side, while Artemidorus states that the length on the Arabian\r\nside is seventeen hundred and fifty miles, (29.) and that along the\r\nTroglodytic coast, to Ptolemais, the distance is eleven hundred and\r\nthirty-seven and a half. Agrippa, however, maintains that there is\r\nno difference whatever in the length of the two sides, and makes it\r\nseventeen hundred and twenty-two miles. Most writers mention the length\r\nas being four hundred and seventy-five miles, and make the Straits to\r\nface the south-east, being twelve miles wide according to some, fifteen\r\naccording to others.\r\n\r\nThe localities of this region are as follow: On passing the Ælanitic\r\nGulf there is another gulf, by the Arabians called Sœa, upon which\r\nis situate the city of Heroön.[670] The town of Cambysu[671] also\r\nstood here formerly, between the Neli and the Marchades, Cambyses\r\nhaving established there the invalids of his army. We then come to\r\nthe nation of the Tyri, and the port of the Danei, from which place\r\nan attempt has been made to form a navigable canal to the river Nile,\r\nat the spot where it enters the Delta previously mentioned,[672] the\r\ndistance between the river and the Red Sea being sixty-two miles.\r\nThis was contemplated first of all by Sesostris,[673] king of Egypt,\r\nafterwards by Darius, king of the Persians, and still later by Ptolemy\r\nII.,[674] who also made a canal, one hundred feet in width and forty\r\ndeep, extending a distance of thirty-seven miles and a half, as far as\r\nthe Bitter Springs.[675] He was deterred from proceeding any further\r\nwith this work by apprehensions of an inundation, upon finding that\r\nthe Red Sea was three cubits higher than the land in the interior of\r\nEgypt. Some writers, however, do not allege this as the cause, but say\r\nthat his reason was, a fear lest, in consequence of introducing the\r\nsea, the water of the Nile might be spoilt, that being the only source\r\nfrom which the Egyptians obtain water for drinking. Be this as it may,\r\nthe whole of the journey from the Egyptian Sea is usually performed by\r\nland one of the three following ways:—Either from Pelusium across the\r\nsands, in doing which the only method of finding the way is by means of\r\nreeds fixed in the earth, the wind immediately effacing all traces of\r\nfootsteps: by the route which begins two miles beyond Mount Casius, and\r\nat a distance of sixty miles enters the road from Pelusium, adjoining\r\nto which road the Arabian tribe of the Autei dwell; or else by a third\r\nroute, which leads from Gerrum, and which they call Adipsos,[676]\r\npassing through the same Arabians, and shorter by nearly sixty miles,\r\nbut running over rugged mountains and through a district destitute\r\nof water. All these roads lead to Arsinoë,[677] a city founded in\r\nhonour of his sister’s name, upon the Gulf of Carandra, by Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, who was the first to explore Troglodytice, and called the\r\nriver which flows before Arsinoë by the name of Ptolemæus. After this\r\ncomes the little town of Enum, by some writers mentioned as Philotera;\r\nnext to which are the Abasæi, a nation sprung from intermarriages with\r\nthe Troglodytæ, then some wild Arabian tribes, the islands of Sapirine\r\nand Scytala, and after these, deserts as far as Myoshormon, where\r\nwe find the fountain of Tatnos, Mount Æas, the island of Iambe, and\r\nnumerous harbours. Berenice also, is here situate, so called after the\r\nname of the mother of Philadelphus, and to which there is a road from\r\nCoptos, as we have previously stated;[678] then the Arabian Autei, and\r\nthe Zebadei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—TROGLODYTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTroglodytice comes next, by the ancients called Midoë, and by some\r\nMichoë; here is Mount Pentedactylos, some islands called Stenæ\r\nDeiræ,[679] the Halonnesi,[680] a group of islands not less in number,\r\nCardamine, and Topazos,[681] which last has given its name to the\r\nprecious stone so called. The gulf is full of islands; those known as\r\nMareu are supplied with fresh water, those called Erenos, are without\r\nit; these were ruled by governors[682] appointed by the kings. In the\r\ninterior are the Candei, also called Ophiophagi, a people in the habit\r\nof eating serpents; there is no region in existence more productive of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJuba, who appears to have investigated all these matters with\r\nthe greatest diligence, has omitted, in his description of these\r\nregions—unless, indeed, it be an error in the copying—another place\r\ncalled Berenice and surnamed Panchrysos,[683] as also a third surnamed\r\nEpidires,[684] and remarkable for the peculiarity of its site; for it\r\nlies on a long projecting neck of land, at the spot where the Straits\r\nat the mouth of the Red Sea separate the coast of Africa from Arabia by\r\na distance of seven miles only: here too is the island of Cytis,[685]\r\nwhich also produces the topaz.\r\n\r\nBeyond this are forests, in which is Ptolemais,[686] built by\r\nPhiladelphus for the chase of the elephant, and thence called\r\nEpitheras,[687] situate near Lake Monoleus. This is the same region\r\nthat has been already mentioned by us in the Second Book,[688] and\r\nin which, during forty-five days before the summer solstice and for\r\nas many after, there is no shadow at the sixth hour, and during the\r\nother hours of the day it falls to the south; while at other times it\r\nfalls to the north; whereas at the Berenice of which we first[689]\r\nmade mention, on the day of the summer solstice the shadow totally\r\ndisappears at the sixth hour, but no other unusual phænomenon is\r\nobserved. That place is situate at a distance of six hundred and\r\ntwo miles from Ptolemais, which has thus become the subject of a\r\nremarkable theory, and has promoted the exercise of a spirit of the\r\nmost profound investigation; for it was at this spot that the extent of\r\nthe earth was first ascertained, it being the fact that Erastosthenes,\r\nbeginning at this place by the accurate calculation of the length of\r\nthe shadow, was enabled to determine with exactness the dimensions of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nAfter passing this place we come to the Azanian[690] Sea, a promontory\r\nby some writers called Hispalus, Lake Mandalum, and the island of\r\nColocasitis, with many others lying out in the main sea, upon which\r\nmultitudes of turtles are found. We then come to the town of Suche,\r\nthe island of Daphnidis,[691] and the town of the Adulitæ,[692] a\r\nplace founded by Egyptian runaway slaves. This is the principal mart\r\nfor the Troglodytæ, as also for the people of Æthiopia: it is distant\r\nfrom Ptolemais five days’ sail. To this place they bring ivory in\r\nlarge quantities, horns of the rhinoceros, hides of the hippopotamus,\r\ntortoise-shell, sphingiæ,[693] and slaves. Beyond the Æthiopian Aroteræ\r\nare the islands known by the name of Aliæu,[694] as also those of\r\nBacchias, Antibacchias, and Stratioton. After passing these, on the\r\ncoast of Æthiopia, there is a gulf which remains unexplored still; a\r\ncircumstance the more to be wondered at, seeing that merchants have\r\npursued their investigations to a greater distance than this. We then\r\ncome to a promontory, upon which there is a spring called Cucios,[695]\r\nmuch resorted to by mariners. Beyond it is the Port of Isis, distant\r\nten days’ rowing from the town of the Adulitæ: myrrh is brought to\r\nthis port by the Troglodytæ. The two islands before the harbour are\r\ncalled Pseudepylæ,[696] and those in it, the same in number, are known\r\nas Pylæ;[697] upon one of these there are some stone columns inscribed\r\nwith unknown characters. Beyond these is the Gulf of Abalites, the\r\nisland of Diodorus,[698] and other desert islands; also, on the\r\nmainland, a succession of deserts, and then the town of Gaza, and the\r\npromontory and port of Mossylum,[699] to the latter of which cinnamon\r\nis brought for exportation: it was thus far that Sesostris led[700] his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nSome writers place even beyond this, upon the shore, one town of\r\nÆthiopia, called Baricaza. Juba will have it that at the Promontory\r\nof Mossylum[701] the Atlantic Sea begins, and that with a north-west\r\nwind[702] we may sail past his native country, the Mauritanias, and\r\narrive at Gades. We ought not on this occasion to curtail any portion\r\nof the opinions so expressed by him. He says that after we pass the\r\npromontory of the Indians,[703] known as Lepteacra, and by others\r\ncalled Drepanum, the distance, in a straight line, beyond the island\r\nof Exusta and Malichu, is fifteen hundred miles; from thence to a\r\nplace called Sceneos two hundred and twenty-five; and from thence\r\nto the island of Adanu one hundred and fifty miles; so that the\r\ndistance to the open sea[704] is altogether eighteen hundred and\r\nseventy-five miles. All the other writers, however, are of opinion\r\nthat, in consequence of the intensity of the sun’s heat, this sea is\r\nnot navigable; added to which, commerce is greatly exposed to the\r\ndepredations of a piratical tribe of Arabians called Ascitæ,[705] who\r\ndwell upon the islands: placing two inflated skins of oxen beneath\r\na raft of wood, they ply their piratical vocation with the aid of\r\npoisoned arrows. We learn also from the same author that some nations\r\nof the Troglodytæ have the name of Therothoæ,[706] being so called from\r\ntheir skill in hunting. They are remarkable for their swiftness, he\r\nsays, just as the Ichthyophagi are, who can swim like the animals whose\r\nelement is the sea. He speaks also of the Bangeni, the Gangoræ, the\r\nChalybes, the Xoxinæ, the Sirechæ, the Daremæ, and the Domazames. Juba\r\nstates, too, that the inhabitants who dwell on the banks of the Nile\r\nfrom Syene as far as Meroë, are not a people of Æthiopia, but Arabians;\r\nand that the city of the Sun, which we have mentioned[707] as situate\r\nnot far from Memphis, in our description of Egypt, was founded by\r\nArabians. There are some writers who take away the further bank of the\r\nNile from Æthiopia,[708] and unite it to Africa;[709] and they people\r\nits sides with tribes attracted thither by its water. We shall leave\r\nthese matters, however, to the option of each, to form his opinion on\r\nthem, and shall now proceed to mention the towns on each side[710] in\r\nthe order in which they are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—ÆTHIOPIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Syene,[711] and taking first the Arabian side, we find\r\nthe nation of the Catadupi, then the Syenitæ, and the town of\r\nTacompsos,[712] by some called Thatice, as also Aramasos, Sesamos,\r\nSanduma, Masindomacam, Arabeta and Boggia, Leupitorga, Tantarene,\r\nMecindita, Noa, Gloploa, Gystate, Megada, Lea, Renni, Nups, Direa,\r\nPatiga, Bacata, Dumana, Rhadata, at which place a golden cat was\r\nworshipped as a god, Boron, in the interior, and Mallos, near Meroë;\r\nthis is the account given by Bion.\r\n\r\nJuba, however, gives another account; he says that there is a city on\r\nMount Megatichos,[713] which lies between Egypt and Æthiopia, by the\r\nArabians known as Myrson, after which come Tacompsos, Aramus, Sesamos,\r\nPide, Mamuda, Orambis, situate near a stream of bitumen, Amodita,\r\nProsda, Parenta, Mama, Tesatta, Gallas, Zoton, Graucome, Emeus, the\r\nPidibotæ, the Hebdomecontacometæ,[714] Nomades, who dwell in tents,\r\nCyste, Macadagale, Proaprimis, Nups, Detrelis, Patis, the Ganbreves,\r\nthe Magasnei, Segasmala, Crandala, Denna, Cadeuma, Thena, Batta,\r\nAlana, Mascoa, the Scammi, Hora, situate on an island, and then Abala,\r\nAndrogalis, Sesecre, the Malli, and Agole.\r\n\r\nOn the African side[715] we find mentioned, either what is another\r\nplace with the same name of Tacompsos, or else a part of the one\r\nbefore-mentioned, and after it Moggore, Sæa, Edos, Plenariæ, Pinnis,\r\nMagassa, Buma, Linthuma, Spintum, Sydop, the Censi, Pindicitora,\r\nAcug, Orsum, Sansa, Maumarum, Urbim, the town of Molum, by the Greeks\r\ncalled Hypaton,[716] Pagoarca, Zmanes, at which point elephants begin\r\nto be found, the Mambli, Berressa, and Acetuma; there was formerly a\r\ntown also called Epis, over against Meroë, which had, however, been\r\ndestroyed before Bion wrote.\r\n\r\nThese are the names of places given as far as Meroë; but at the present\r\nday hardly any of them on either side of the river are in existence;\r\nat all events, the prætorian troops that were sent by the Emperor\r\nNero[717] under the command of a tribune, for the purposes of enquiry,\r\nwhen, among his other wars, he was contemplating an expedition against\r\nÆthiopia, brought back word that they had met with nothing but deserts\r\non their route. The Roman arms also penetrated into these regions\r\nin the time of the late Emperor Augustus, under the command of P.\r\nPetronius,[718] a man of Equestrian rank, and prefect of Egypt. That\r\ngeneral took the following cities, the only ones we now find mentioned\r\nthere, in the following order; Pselcis,[719] Primis, Abuncis, Phthuris,\r\nCambusis, Atteva, and Stadasis, where the river Nile, as it thunders\r\ndown the precipices, has quite deprived the inhabitants of the power of\r\nhearing: he also sacked the town of Napata.[720] The extreme distance\r\nto which he penetrated beyond Syene was nine hundred and seventy miles;\r\nbut still, it was not the Roman arms that rendered these regions a\r\ndesert. Æthiopia, in its turn gaining the mastery, and then again\r\nreduced to servitude, was at last worn out by its continual wars with\r\nEgypt, having been a famous and powerful country even at the time of\r\nthe Trojan war, when Memnon[721] was its king; it is also very evident\r\nfrom the fabulous stories about Andromeda,[722] that it ruled over\r\nSyria in the time of king Cepheus, and that its sway extended as far as\r\nthe shores of our sea.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, also, there have been conflicting accounts as\r\nto the extent of this country: first by Dalion, who travelled a\r\nconsiderable distance beyond Meroë, and after him by Aristocreon\r\nand Basilis, as well as the younger Simonides, who made a stay of\r\nfive years at Meroë,[723] when he wrote his account of Æthiopia.\r\nTimosthenes, however, the commander of the fleets of Philadelphus,\r\nwithout giving any other estimate as to the distance, says that Meroë\r\nis sixty days’ journey from Syene; while Eratosthenes states that\r\nthe distance is six hundred and twenty-five miles, and Artemidorus\r\nsix hundred. Sebosus says that from the extreme point of Egypt, the\r\ndistance to Meroë is sixteen hundred and seventy-five miles, while the\r\nother writers last mentioned make it twelve hundred and fifty. All\r\nthese differences, however, have since been settled; for the persons\r\nsent by Nero for the purposes of discovery have reported that the\r\ndistance from Syene to Meroë is eight hundred and seventy-one miles,\r\nthe following being the items. From Syene to Hiera Sycaminos[724]\r\nthey make to be fifty-four miles, from thence to Tama seventy-two,\r\nto the country of the Evonymitæ,[725] the first region of Æthiopia,\r\none hundred and twenty, to Acina fifty-four, to Pittara twenty-five,\r\nand to Tergedus one hundred and six. They state also that the island\r\nof Gagaudes lies at an equal distance from Syene and Meroë, and\r\nthat it is at this place that the bird called the parrot was first\r\nseen; while at another island called Articula, the animal known as\r\nthe sphingium[726] was first discovered by them, and after passing\r\nTergedus, the cynocephalus.[727] The distance from thence to Napata is\r\neighty miles, that little town being the only one of all of them that\r\nnow survives. From thence to the island of Meroë the distance is three\r\nhundred and sixty miles. They also state that the grass in the vicinity\r\nof Meroë becomes of a greener and fresher colour, and that there is\r\nsome slight appearance of forests, as also traces of the rhinoceros\r\nand elephant. They reported also that the city of Meroë stands at a\r\ndistance of seventy miles from the first entrance of the island of\r\nMeroë, and that close to it is another island, Tadu by name, which\r\nforms a harbour facing those who enter the right hand channel of the\r\nriver. The buildings in the city, they said, were but few in number,\r\nand they stated that a female, whose name was Candace, ruled over the\r\ndistrict, that name having passed from queen to queen for many years.\r\nThey related also that there was a temple of Jupiter Hammon there,\r\nheld in great veneration, besides smaller shrines erected in honour of\r\nhim throughout all the country. In addition to these particulars, they\r\nwere informed that in the days of the Æthiopian dominion, the island of\r\nMeroë enjoyed great renown, and that, according to tradition, it was\r\nin the habit of maintaining two hundred thousand armed men, and four\r\nthousand artisans. The kings of Æthiopia are said even at the present\r\nday to be forty-five in number.\r\n\r\n(30.) The whole of this country has successively had the names of\r\nÆtheria,[728] Atlantia, and last of all, Æthiopia, from Æthiops, the\r\nson of Vulcan. It is not at all surprising that towards the extremity\r\nof this region the men and animals assume a monstrous form, when we\r\nconsider the changeableness and volubility of fire, the heat of which\r\nis the great agent in imparting various forms and shapes to bodies.\r\nIndeed, it is reported that in the interior, on the eastern side, there\r\nis a people that have no noses, the whole face presenting a plane\r\nsurface; that others again are destitute of the upper lip, and others\r\nare without tongues. Others again, have the mouth grown together, and\r\nbeing destitute of nostrils, breathe through one passage only, imbibing\r\ntheir drink through it by means of the hollow stalk of the oat, which\r\nthere grows spontaneously and supplies them with its grain for food.\r\nSome of these nations have to employ gestures by nodding the head and\r\nmoving the limbs, instead of speech. Others again were unacquainted\r\nwith the use of fire before the time of Ptolemy Lathyrus, king of\r\nEgypt. Some writers have also stated that there is a nation of Pygmies,\r\nwhich dwells among the marshes in which the river Nile takes its rise;\r\nwhile on the coast of Æthiopia, where we paused,[729] there is a range\r\nof mountains, of a red colour, which have the appearance of being\r\nalways burning.\r\n\r\nAll the country, after we pass Meroë, is bounded by the Troglodytæ and\r\nthe Red Sea, it being three days’ journey from Napata to the shores\r\nof that sea; throughout the whole of this district the rain water is\r\ncarefully preserved at several places, while the country that lies\r\nbetween is extremely productive of gold. The parts beyond this are\r\ninhabited by the Adabuli, a nation of Æthiopia; and here, over against\r\nMeroë, are the Megabarri,[730] by some writers called the Adiabari;\r\nthey occupy the city of Apollo; some of them, however, are Nomades,\r\nliving on the flesh of elephants. Opposite to them, on the African\r\nside, dwell the Macrobii,[731] and then again, beyond the Megabarri,\r\nthere are the Memnones and the Dabeli, and, at a distance of twenty\r\ndays’ journey, the Critensi. Beyond these are the Dochi, and then the\r\nGymnetes, who always go naked; and after them the Andetæ, the Mothitæ,\r\nthe Mesaches, and the Ipsodoræ, who are of a black tint, but stain the\r\nbody all over with a kind of red earth. On the African side again there\r\nare the Medimni, and then a nation of Nomades, who live on the milk of\r\nthe cynocephalus, and then the Aladi and the Syrbotæ,[732] which last\r\nare said to be eight cubits in height.\r\n\r\nAristocreon informs us that on the Libyan side, at a distance of five\r\ndays’ journey from Meroë, is the town of Tolles, and then at a further\r\ndistance of twelve days’ journey, Esar, a town founded by the Egyptians\r\nwho fled from Psammetichus;[733] he states also that they dwelt there\r\nfor a period of three hundred years, and that opposite, on the Arabian\r\nside, there is a town of theirs called Daron.[734] The town, however,\r\nwhich he calls Esar, is by Bion called Sape, who says that the name\r\nmeans “the strangers:” their capital being Sembobitis, situate on an\r\nisland, and a third place of theirs, Sinat in Arabia. Between the\r\nmountains and the river Nile are the Simbarri, the Palugges, and, on\r\nthe mountains themselves, the Asachæ, who are divided into numerous\r\npeoples; they are said to be distant five days’ journey from the sea,\r\nand to procure their subsistence by the chase of the elephant. An\r\nisland in the Nile, which belongs to the Semberritæ, is governed by a\r\nqueen; beyond it are the Æthiopian Nubei,[735] at a distance of eight\r\ndays’ journey: their town is Tenupsis, situate on the Nile. There are\r\nthe Sesambri also, a people among whom all the quadrupeds are without\r\nears, the very elephants even. On the African side are the Tonobari,\r\nthe Ptoenphæ, a people who have a dog for their king, and divine from\r\nhis movements what are his commands; the Auruspi, who have a town at\r\na considerable distance from the Nile, and then the Archisarmi, the\r\nPhaliges, the Marigerri, and the Casmari.\r\n\r\nBion makes mention also of some other towns situate on islands, the\r\nwhole distance being twenty days’ journey from Sembobitis to Meroë;\r\na town in an adjoining island, under the queen of the Semberritæ,\r\nwith another called Asara, and another, in a second island, called\r\nDarde. The name of a third island is Medoë, upon which is the town of\r\nAsel, and a fourth is called Garodes, with a town upon it of the same\r\nname. Passing thence along the banks of the Nile, are the towns of\r\nNavi, Modunda, Andatis, Secundum, Colligat, Secande, Navectabe, Cumi,\r\nAgrospi, Ægipa, Candrogari, Araba, and Summara.[736]\r\n\r\nBeyond is the region of Sirbitum, at which the mountains\r\nterminate,[737] and which by some writers is said to contain the\r\nmaritime Æthiopians, the Nisacæthæ, and the Nisyti, a word which\r\nsignifies “men with three or four eyes,”—not that the people really\r\nhave that conformation, but because they are remarkable for the\r\nunerring aim of their arrows. On that side of the Nile which extends\r\nalong the borders of the Southern Ocean beyond the Greater Syrtes,[738]\r\nDalion says that the people, who use rain-water only, are called the\r\nCisori, and that the other nations are the Longompori, distant five\r\ndays’ journey from the Œcalices, the Usibalci, the Isbeli, the Perusii,\r\nthe Ballii, and the Cispii, the rest being deserts, and inhabited\r\nby the tribes of fable only. In a more westerly direction are the\r\nNigroæ, whose king has only one eye, and that in the forehead, the\r\nAgriophagi,[739] who live principally on the flesh of panthers and\r\nlions, the Pamphagi,[740] who will eat anything, the Anthropophagi, who\r\nlive on human flesh, the Cynamolgi,[741] a people with the heads of\r\ndogs, the Artabatitæ, who have four feet, and wander about after the\r\nmanner of wild beasts; and, after them, the Hesperiæ and the Perorsi,\r\nwhom we have already spoken[742] of as dwelling on the confines of\r\nMauritania. Some tribes, too, of the Æthiopians subsist on nothing but\r\nlocusts,[743] which are smoke-dried and salted as their provision for\r\nthe year; these people do not live beyond their fortieth year.\r\n\r\nM. Agrippa was of opinion that the length[744] of the whole country of\r\nthe Æthiopians, including the Red Sea, was two thousand one hundred\r\nand seventy miles, and its breadth, including Upper Egypt, twelve\r\nhundred and ninety-seven. Some authors again have made the following\r\ndivisions of its length; from Meroë to Sirbitum eleven days’ sail,\r\nfrom Sirbitum to the Dabelli fifteen days’, and from them to the\r\nÆthiopian Ocean six days’ journey. It is agreed by most authors,\r\nthat the distance altogether, from the ocean[745] to Meroë, is six\r\nhundred and twenty-five miles, and from Meroë to Syene, that which we\r\nhave already mentioned. Æthiopia lies from south-east to south-west.\r\nSituate as it is, in a southern hemisphere, forests of ebony are to\r\nbe seen of the brightest verdure; and in the midst of these regions\r\nthere is a mountain of immense height, which overhangs the sea, and\r\nemits a perpetual flame. By the Greeks this mountain is called Theon\r\nOchema,[746] and at a distance of four days’ sail from it is a\r\npromontory, known as Hesperu Ceras,[747] upon the confines of Africa,\r\nand close to the Hesperiæ, an Æthiopian nation. There are some writers\r\nwho affirm that in these regions there are hills of a moderate height,\r\nwhich afford a pleasant shade from the groves with which they are clad,\r\nand are the haunts of Ægipans[748] and Satyrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (31.)—ISLANDS OF THE ÆTHIOPIAN SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learn from Ephorus, as well as Eudoxus and Timosthenes, that there\r\nare great numbers of islands scattered all over this sea; Clitarchus\r\nsays that king Alexander was informed of an island so rich that the\r\ninhabitants gave a talent of gold for a horse, and of another[749]\r\nupon which there was found a sacred mountain, shaded with a grove, the\r\ntrees of which emitted odours of wondrous sweetness; this last was\r\nsituate over against the Persian Gulf. Cerne[750] is the name of an\r\nisland situate opposite to Æthiopia, the size of which has not been\r\nascertained, nor yet its distance from the main land: it is said that\r\nits inhabitants are exclusively Æthiopians. Ephorus states that those\r\nwho sail from the Red Sea into the Æthiopian Ocean cannot get beyond\r\nthe Columnæ[751] there, some little islands so called. Polybius says\r\nthat Cerne is situate at the extremity of Mauritania, over against\r\nMount Atlas, and at a distance of eight stadia from the land; while\r\nCornelius Nepos states that it lies very nearly in the same meridian\r\nas Carthage, at a distance from the mainland of ten miles, and that\r\nit is not more than two miles in circumference. It is said also that\r\nthere is another island situate over against Mount Atlas, being itself\r\nknown by the name of Atlantis.[752] Five days’ sail beyond it there are\r\ndeserts, as far as the Æthiopian Hesperiæ and the promontory, which\r\nwe have mentioned as being called Hesperu Ceras, a point at which the\r\nface of the land first takes a turn towards the west and the Atlantic\r\nSea. Facing this promontory are also said to be the islands called the\r\nGorgades,[753] the former abodes of the Gorgons, two days’ sail from\r\nthe mainland, according to Xenophon of Lampsacus. Hanno, a general of\r\nthe Carthaginians, penetrated as far as these regions, and brought\r\nback an account that the bodies of the women were covered with hair,\r\nbut that the men, through their swiftness of foot, made their escape;\r\nin proof of which singularity in their skin, and as evidence of a\r\nfact so miraculous, he placed the skins[754] of two of these females\r\nin the temple of Juno, which were to be seen there until the capture\r\nof Carthage. Beyond these even, are said to be the two islands of the\r\nHesperides; but so uncertain are all the accounts relative to this\r\nsubject, that Statius Sebosus says that it is forty days’ sail, past\r\nthe coast of the Atlas range, from the islands of the Gorgons to those\r\nof the Hesperides, and one day’s sail from these to the Hesperu Ceras.\r\nNor have we any more certain information relative to the islands of\r\nMauritania. We only know, as a fact well-ascertained, that some few\r\nwere discovered by Juba over against the country of the Autololes, upon\r\nwhich he established a manufactory of Gætulian purple.[755]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (32.)—THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some authors who think that beyond these are the Fortunate\r\nIslands,[756] and some others; the number of which Sebosus gives, as\r\nwell as the distances, informing us that Junonia[757] is an island\r\nseven hundred and fifty miles distant from Gades. He states also\r\nthat Pluvialia[758] and Capraria[759] are the same distance from\r\nJunonia, to the west; and that in Pluvialia the only fresh water to\r\nbe obtained is rain water. He then states that at a distance of two\r\nhundred and fifty miles from these, opposite the left of Mauritania,\r\nand situate in the direction of the sun at the eighth hour, are the\r\nFortunate Islands,[760] one of which, from its undulating surface,\r\nhas the name of Invallis,[761] and another that of Planasia,[762]\r\nfrom the peculiarity[763] of its appearance. He states also that the\r\ncircumference of Invallis is three hundred miles, and that trees grow\r\nto a height of one hundred and fourteen feet.\r\n\r\nRelative to the Fortunate Islands, Juba has ascertained the following\r\nfacts: that they are situate to the south in nearly a due westerly\r\ndirection, and at a distance from the Purple Islands of six hundred\r\nand twenty-five miles, the sailing being made for two hundred and\r\nfifty miles due west, and then three hundred and seventy-five towards\r\nthe east.[764] He states that the first is called Ombrios,[765] and\r\nthat it presents no traces of buildings whatever; that among the\r\nmountains there is a lake, and some trees,[766] which bear a strong\r\nresemblance to giant fennel, and from which water is extracted; that\r\ndrawn from those that are black is of a bitter taste, but that produced\r\nby the white ones is agreeable and good for drinking. He states also\r\nthat a second island has the name of Junonia, but that it contains\r\nnothing beyond a small temple of stone: also that in its vicinity\r\nthere is another, but smaller, island[767] of the same name, and then\r\nanother called Capraria, which is infested by multitudes of huge\r\nlizards. According to the same author, in sight of these islands is\r\nNinguaria,[768] which has received that name from its perpetual snows;\r\nthis island abounds also in fogs. The one next to it is Canaria;[769]\r\nit contains vast multitudes of dogs of very large size, two of which\r\nwere brought home to Juba: there are some traces of buildings to be\r\nseen here. While all these islands abound in fruit and birds of every\r\nkind, this one produces in great numbers the date palm which bears the\r\ncaryota, also pine nuts. Honey too abounds here, and in the rivers\r\npapyrus, and the fish called silurus,[770] are found. These islands,\r\nhowever, are greatly annoyed by the putrefying bodies of monsters,\r\nwhich are constantly thrown up by the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF PLACES ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now fully described the earth, both without[771] as well as\r\nwithin, it seems only proper that we should succinctly state the length\r\nand breadth of its various seas.\r\n\r\n(33.) Polybius has stated, that in a straight line from the Straits of\r\nGades to the mouth of the Mæotis, it is a distance of three thousand\r\nfour hundred and thirty-seven miles and a half, and that, starting\r\nfrom the same point,[772] the distance in a straight line to Sicily\r\nis twelve hundred and fifty miles, from thence to Crete three hundred\r\nand seventy-five, to Rhodes one hundred and eighty-seven and a half,\r\nto the Chelidonian Islands the same distance, to Cyprus two hundred\r\nand twenty-five, and from thence to Seleucia Pieria, in Syria, one\r\nhundred and fifteen miles: the sum of all which distances amounts to\r\ntwo thousand three hundred and forty miles. Agrippa estimates this\r\nsame distance, in a straight line from the Straits of Gades to the\r\nGulf of Issus, at three thousand three hundred and forty miles; in\r\nwhich computation, however, I am not certain that there is not some\r\nerror in the figures, seeing that the same author has stated that the\r\ndistance from the Straits of Sicily to Alexandria is thirteen hundred\r\nand fifty miles. Taking the whole length of the sea-line throughout the\r\ngulfs above-mentioned, and beginning at the same point,[773] he makes\r\nit ten thousand and fifty-eight miles; to which number Artemidorus\r\nhas added seven hundred and fifty-six: the same author, including in\r\nhis calculation the shores of the Mæotis, makes the whole distance\r\nseventeen thousand three hundred and ninety miles. Such is the\r\nmeasurement given by men who have penetrated into distant countries,\r\nunaided by force of arms, and have, with a boldness that exhibits\r\nitself in the times of peace even, challenged, as it were, Fortune\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to compare the dimensions of the various parts\r\nof the earth, however great the difficulties which may arise from\r\nthe discrepancy of the accounts given by various authors: the most\r\nconvenient method, however, will be that of adding the breadth to the\r\nlength.[774] Following this mode of reckoning, the dimensions of Europe\r\nwill be eight thousand two hundred and ninety-four miles; of Africa,\r\nto adopt a mean between all the various accounts given by authors, the\r\nlength is three thousand seven hundred and ninety-four miles, while the\r\nbreadth, so far as it is inhabited, in no part exceeds two hundred\r\nand fifty miles.[775] But, as Agrippa, including its deserts, makes\r\nit from Cyrenaica, a part of it, to the country of the Garamantes,\r\nso far as was then known, a further distance of nine hundred and ten\r\nmiles, the entire length, added together, will make a distance of four\r\nthousand six hundred and eight miles. The length of Asia is generally\r\nadmitted[776] to be six thousand three hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles, and the breadth, which ought, properly, to be reckoned from\r\nthe Æthiopian Sea to Alexandria,[777] near the river Nile, so as to\r\nrun through Meroë and Syene, is eighteen hundred and seventy-five. It\r\nappears then that Europe is greater than Asia, by a little less than\r\none half of Asia, and greater than Africa by as much again of Africa\r\nand one-sixth. If all these sums are added together, it will be clearly\r\nseen that Europe is one-third, and a little more than one-eighth part\r\nof one-third, Asia one-fourth and one-fourteenth part of one-fourth,\r\nand Africa, one-fifth and one-sixtieth part of one-fifth of the whole\r\nearth.[778]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—DIVISION OF THE EARTH INTO PARALLELS AND SHADOWS OF EQUAL\r\nLENGTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the above we shall add even another instance of ingenious discovery\r\nby the Greeks, and indeed of the most minute skilfulness; that so\r\nnothing may be wanting to our investigation of the geographical\r\ndivisions of the earth, and the various countries thereof which have\r\nbeen pointed out; that it may be the better understood, too, what\r\naffinity, or relationship as it were, exists between one region and\r\nanother, in respect to the length of their days and nights, and in\r\nwhich of them the shadows are of equal length, and the distance from\r\nthe pole is the same. I shall therefore give these particulars as well,\r\nand shall state the divisions of the whole earth in accordance with the\r\nvarious sections of the heavens. The lines or segments which divide\r\nthe world are many in number; by our people they are known as “circuli”\r\nor circles, by the Greeks they are called “paralleli” or parallels.\r\n\r\n(34.) The first begins at that part of India which looks towards the\r\nsouth, and extends to Arabia and those who dwell upon the borders\r\nof the Red Sea. It embraces the Gedrosi, the Carmanii, the Persæ,\r\nthe Elymæi, Parthyene, Aria, Susiane, Mesopotamia, Seleucia surnamed\r\nBabylonia, Arabia as far as Petra, Cœle Syria, Pelusium, the lower\r\nparts of Egypt called the Chora of Alexandria, the maritime parts\r\nof Africa, all the cities of Cyrenaica, Thapsus, Adrumetum, Clupea,\r\nCarthage, Utica, the two Hippo’s, Numidia, the two Mauritanias, the\r\nAtlantic Sea, and the Pillars of Hercules. Within the meridian of\r\nthis parallel, on the middle day of the equinox, the pin of the dial,\r\nusually called the gnomon, if seven feet in length, throws a shadow\r\nat mid-day no more than four feet long: the longest day and night are\r\nfourteen equinoctial hours respectively, the shortest being only ten.\r\n\r\nThe next circle or parallel begins with the western parts of India,\r\nand runs through the middle of Parthia, through Persepolis, the nearer\r\nparts of Persis, the nearer Arabia, Judæa, and the people who live near\r\nMount Libanus, and it embraces Babylon, Idumæa, Samaria, Hierosolyma,\r\nAscalon, Joppa, Cæsarea in Phœnicia, Ptolemais, Sidon, Tyre, Berytus,\r\nBotrys, Tripolis, Byblus, Antiochia, Laodicea, Seleucia, the maritime\r\nparts of Cilicia, the southern parts of Cyprus, Crete, Lilybæum in\r\nSicily, and the northern parts of Africa and Numidia. In these regions,\r\nat the time of the equinox, a gnomon of thirty-five feet in length\r\ngives only a shadow twenty-four feet long; and the longest day and\r\nnight are respectively fourteen equinoctial hours, and one-fifth of an\r\nhour, in length.\r\n\r\nThe third circle or parallel begins at the part of India which lies in\r\nthe vicinity of Mount Imaüs, and runs through the Caspian Gates and the\r\nnearer parts of Media, Cataonia, Cappadocia, Taurus, Amanus, Issus, the\r\nPasses of Cilicia, Soli, Tarsus, Cyprus, Pisidia, Side in Pamphylia,\r\nLycaonia, Patara in Lycia, Xanthus, Caunus, Rhodes, Cos, Halicarnassus,\r\nCnidos, Doris, Chios, Delos, the middle of the Cyclades, Gythium,\r\nMalea, Argos, Laconia, Elis, Olympia, Messenia in Peloponnesus,\r\nSyracuse, Catina, the middle of Sicily, the southern parts of Sardinia,\r\nCarteia, and Gades. A gnomon, one hundred inches in length, throws\r\na shadow seventy-seven inches long; the length of the longest day is\r\nfourteen equinoctial hours and a half, plus one thirtieth of an hour.\r\n\r\nUnder the fourth circle or parallel lie those parts of India which\r\nare on the other side of the Imaüs, the southern parts of Cappadocia,\r\nGalatia, Mysia, Sardis, Smyrna, Sipylus, Mount Tmolus, Lydia, Caria,\r\nIonia, Tralles, Colophon, Ephesus, Miletus, Chios, Samos, the Icarian\r\nSea, the northern part of the Cyclades, Athens, Megara, Corinth,\r\nSicyon, Achaia, Patræ, the Isthmus, Epirus, the northern parts of\r\nSicily, the eastern parts of Gallia Narbonensis, and the sea-coast\r\nof Spain, from New Carthage westward. In these districts a gnomon of\r\ntwenty-one feet throws a shadow of sixteen feet in length; the longest\r\nday contains fourteen equinoctial hours and two-thirds of an hour.\r\n\r\nUnder the fifth zone are included, from the entrance to the Caspian\r\nSea, the Bactri, Iberia, Armenia, Mysia, Phrygia, the Hellespont,\r\nTroas, Tenedos, Abydos, Scepsis, Ilium, Mount Ida, Cyzicus, Lampsacus,\r\nSinope, Amisus, Heraclea in Pontus, Paphlagonia, Lemnos, Imbros,\r\nThasos, Cassandria, Thessaly, Macedonia, Larissa, Amphipolis,\r\nThessalonica, Pella, Edessa, Berœa, Pharsalia, Carystus, Eubœa in\r\nBœotia, Chalcis, Delphi, Acarnania, Ætolia, Apollonia, Brudisium,\r\nTarentum, Thurii, Locri, Rhegium, the Lucani, Neapolis, Puteoli, the\r\nTuscan Sea, Corsica, the Balearic Islands, and the middle of Spain. A\r\ngnomon, seven feet in length, in these countries gives a shadow of six\r\nfeet, and the length of the day is fifteen equinoctial hours.\r\n\r\nThe sixth division, in which Rome is included, embraces the Caspian\r\nnations, Caucasus, the northern parts of Armenia, Apollonia on the\r\nRhyndacus, Nicomedia, Nicæa, Chalcedon, Byzantium, Lysimachia, the\r\nChersonnesus, the Gulf of Melas, Abdera, Samothracia, Maronea, Ænus,\r\nBessica, Thracia, Mædica, Pæonia, the Illyrii, Dyrrhachium, Canusium,\r\nthe extreme parts of Apulia, Campania, Etruria, Pisæ, Luna, Luca,\r\nGenua, Liguria, Antipolis, Massilia, Narbo, Tarraco, the middle parts\r\nof Hispania Tarraconensis, and thence through Lusitania. A gnomon of\r\nnine feet here throws a shadow eight feet long; the greatest length of\r\nthe day is fifteen equinoctial hours, plus one-ninth part of an hour,\r\nor, according to Nigidius, one-fifth.\r\n\r\nThe seventh division begins on the other side of the Caspian Sea,\r\nand the line runs above Callatis, and through the Bosporus, the\r\nBorysthenes, Tomi, the back part of Thrace, the Triballi, the remainder\r\nof Illyricum, the Adriatic Sea, Aquileia, Altinum, Venetia, Vicetia,\r\nPatavium, Verona, Cremona, Ravenna, Ancona, Picenum, the Marsi, the\r\nPeligni, the Sabini, Umbria, Ariminum, Bononia, Placentia, Mediolanum,\r\nall the districts at the foot of the Apennines, and, beyond the Alps,\r\nGallia Aquitanica, Vienna, the Pyrenæan range, and Celtiberia. A gnomon\r\nthirty-five feet in length here throws a shadow of thirty-six feet,\r\nexcept in some parts of Venetia, where the shadow just equals the\r\nlength of the gnomon; the longest day is fifteen equinoctial hours,\r\nplus three-fifths of an hour.\r\n\r\nThus far we have set forth the results of observations made by the\r\nancients. The remaining part of the earth has been divided, through the\r\ncareful researches of those of more recent times, by three additional\r\nparallels. The first runs from the Tanais through the Mæotis and the\r\ncountry of the Sarmatæ, as far as the Borysthenes, and so through the\r\nDaci and part of Germany, and the Gallic provinces, as far as the\r\nshores of the ocean, the longest day being sixteen hours.\r\n\r\nThe second parallel runs through the country of the Hyperborei and the\r\nisland of Britannia, the longest day being seventeen hours in length.\r\n\r\nThe last of all is the Scythian parallel, which runs from the Riphæan\r\nrange to Thule, in which, as we have already stated,[779] the year is\r\ndivided into days and nights alternately, of six months’ duration. The\r\nsame authors have also placed before the first parallel, which we have\r\nhere given,[780] two other parallels or circles; the first running\r\nthrough the island of Meroë and the city of Ptolemais which was built\r\non the Red Sea for the chase of the elephant; where the longest day\r\nis twelve hours and a half in length; and the second passing through\r\nSyene in Egypt, in which the longest day is thirteen hours in length.\r\nThe same authors have also added half an hour to each of the parallels,\r\ntill they come to the last.\r\n\r\nThus far on the Geography of the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSummary.—Towns mentioned, eleven hundred and ninety-four.

Our first attention is justly due to Man, for\r\nwhose sake all other things appear to have been produced by Nature;\r\nthough, on the other hand, with so great and so severe penalties for\r\nthe enjoyment of her bounteous gifts, that it is far from easy to\r\ndetermine, whether she has proved to him a kind parent, or a merciless\r\nstep-mother.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, she obliges him alone, of all animated beings, to\r\nclothe himself with the spoils of the others; while, to all the rest,\r\nshe has given various kinds of coverings, such as shells, crusts,\r\nspines, hides, furs, bristles, hair, down, feathers, scales, and\r\nfleeces.[837] The very trunks of the trees even, she has protected\r\nagainst the effects of heat and cold by a bark, which is, in some\r\ncases, twofold.[838] Man alone, at the very moment of his birth\r\ncast naked upon the naked earth,[839] does she abandon to cries, to\r\nlamentations, and, a thing that is the case with no other animal\r\nwhatever, to tears: this, too, from the very moment that he enters upon\r\nexistence.[840] But as for laughter, why, by Hercules!—to laugh, if but\r\nfor an instant only, has never been granted to man before the fortieth\r\nday[841] from his birth, and then it is looked upon as a miracle of\r\nprecocity. Introduced thus to the light, man has fetters and swathings\r\ninstantly put upon all his limbs,[842] a thing that falls to the lot of\r\nnone of the brutes even that are born among us. Born to such singular\r\ngood fortune,[843] there lies the animal, which is destined to command\r\nall the others, lies, fast bound hand and foot, and weeping aloud! such\r\nbeing the penalty which he has to pay on beginning life, and that for\r\nthe sole fault of having been born. Alas! for the folly of those who\r\ncan think after such a beginning as this, that they have been born for\r\nthe display of vanity!\r\n\r\nThe earliest presage of future strength, the earliest bounty of time,\r\nconfers upon him nought but the resemblance to a quadruped.[844] How\r\nsoon does man gain the power of walking? How soon does he gain the\r\nfaculty of speech? How soon is his mouth fitted for mastication? How\r\nlong are the pulsations of the crown of his head to proclaim him\r\nthe weakest of all animated beings?[845] And then, the diseases to\r\nwhich he is subject, the numerous remedies which he is obliged to\r\ndevise against his maladies, and those thwarted every now and then by\r\nnew forms and features of disease.[846] While other animals have an\r\ninstinctive knowledge of their natural powers; some, of their swiftness\r\nof pace, some of their rapidity of flight, and some again of their\r\npower of swimming; man is the only one that knows nothing, that can\r\nlearn nothing without being taught; he can neither speak, nor walk,\r\nnor eat,[847] and, in short, he can do nothing, at the prompting of\r\nnature only, but weep. For this it is, that many have been of opinion,\r\nthat it were better not to have been born, or if born, to have been\r\nannihilated[848] at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nTo man alone, of all animated beings, has it been given, to\r\ngrieve,[849] to him alone to be guilty of luxury and excess; and that\r\nin modes innumerable, and in every part of his body. Man is the only\r\nbeing that is a prey to ambition, to avarice, to an immoderate desire\r\nof life,[850] to superstition,[851]—he is the only one that troubles\r\nhimself about his burial, and even what is to become of him after\r\ndeath.[852] By none is life held on a tenure more frail;[853] none are\r\nmore influenced by unbridled desires for all things; none are sensible\r\nof fears more bewildering; none are actuated by rage more frantic and\r\nviolent. Other animals, in fine, live at peace with those of their\r\nown kind; we only see them unite to make a stand against those of\r\na different species. The fierceness of the lion is not expended in\r\nfighting with its own kind; the sting of the serpent is not aimed at\r\nthe serpent;[854] and the monsters of the sea even, and the fishes,\r\nvent their rage only on those of a different species. But with man,—by\r\nHercules! most of _his_ misfortunes are occasioned by man.[855]\r\n\r\n(1.) We have already given[856] a general description of the human race\r\nin our account of the different nations. Nor, indeed, do I now propose\r\nto treat of their manners and customs, which are of infinite variety\r\nand almost as numerous as the various groups themselves, into which\r\nmankind is divided; but yet there are some things, which, I think,\r\nought not to be omitted; and more particularly, in relation to those\r\npeoples which dwell at a considerable distance from the sea;[857] among\r\nwhich, I have no doubt, that some facts will appear of an astounding\r\nnature, and, indeed, incredible to many. Who, for instance, could ever\r\nbelieve in the existence of the Æthiopians, who had not first seen\r\nthem? Indeed what is there that does not appear marvellous, when it\r\ncomes to our knowledge for the first time?[858] How many things, too,\r\nare looked upon as quite impossible, until they have been actually\r\neffected?[859] But it is the fact, that every moment of our existence\r\nwe are distrusting the power and the majesty of Nature, if the mind,\r\ninstead of grasping her in her entirety, considers her only in detail.\r\nNot to speak of peacocks, the spotted skins of tigers and panthers,\r\nand the rich colours of so many animals, a trifling thing apparently\r\nto speak of, but of inestimable importance, when we give it due\r\nconsideration, is the existence of so many languages among the various\r\nnations, so many modes of speech, so great a variety of expressions;\r\nthat to another, a man who is of a different country, is almost the\r\nsame as no man at all.[860] And then, too, the human features and\r\ncountenance, although composed of but some ten parts or little more,\r\nare so fashioned, that among so many thousands of men, there are no two\r\nin existence who cannot be distinguished from one another, a result\r\nwhich no art could possibly have produced, when confined to so limited\r\na number of combinations. In most points, however, of this nature, I\r\nshall not be content to pledge my own credit only, but shall confirm it\r\nin preference by referring to my authorities, which shall be given on\r\nall subjects of a nature to inspire doubt. My readers, however, must\r\nmake no objection to following the Greeks, who have proved themselves\r\nthe most careful observers, as well as of the longest standing.[861]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—THE WONDERFUL FORMS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already stated, that there are certain tribes of the Scythians,\r\nand, indeed, many other nations, which feed upon human flesh.[862] This\r\nfact itself might, perhaps, appear incredible, did we not recollect,\r\nthat in the very centre of the earth, in Italy and Sicily, nations\r\nformerly existed with these monstrous propensities, the Cyclopes,[863]\r\nand the Læstrygones, for example; and that, very recently, on the other\r\nside of the Alps, it was the custom to offer human sacrifices, after\r\nthe manner of those nations;[864] and the difference is but small\r\nbetween sacrificing human beings and eating them.[865]\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity also of those who dwell in the northern regions,\r\nand not far from the spot from which the north wind arises, and the\r\nplace which is called its cave,[866] and is known by the name of\r\nGeskleithron, the Arimaspi are said to exist, whom I have previously\r\nmentioned,[867] a nation remarkable for having but one eye, and that\r\nplaced in the middle of the forehead. This race is said to carry on a\r\nperpetual warfare with the Griffins, a kind of monster, with wings, as\r\nthey are commonly[868] represented, for the gold which they dig out of\r\nthe mines, and which these wild beasts retain and keep watch over with\r\na singular degree of cupidity, while the Arimaspi are equally desirous\r\nto get possession of it.[869] Many authors have stated to this effect,\r\namong the most illustrious of whom are Herodotus and Aristeas of\r\nProconnesus.[870]\r\n\r\nBeyond the other Scythian Anthropophagi, there is a country called\r\nAbarimon, situate in a certain great valley of Mount Imaus,[871]\r\nthe inhabitants of which are a savage race, whose feet are turned\r\nbackwards,[872] relatively to their legs: they possess wonderful\r\nvelocity, and wander about indiscriminately with the wild beasts. We\r\nlearn from Beeton, whose duty it was to take the measurements of the\r\nroutes of Alexander the Great, that this people cannot breathe in any\r\nclimate except their own, for which reason it is impossible to take\r\nthem before any of the neighbouring kings; nor could any of them be\r\nbrought before Alexander himself.\r\n\r\nThe Anthropophagi, whom we have previously mentioned[873] as dwelling\r\nten days’ journey beyond the Borysthenes, according to the account\r\nof Isigonus of Nicæa, were in the habit of drinking out of human\r\nskulls,[874] and placing the scalps, with the hair attached, upon their\r\nbreasts, like so many napkins. The same author relates, that there\r\nis, in Albania, a certain race of men, whose eyes are of a sea-green\r\ncolour, and who have white hair from their earliest childhood,[875]\r\nand that these people see better in the night than in the day. He\r\nstates also that the Sauromatæ, who dwell ten days’ journey beyond the\r\nBorysthenes, only take food every other day.[876]\r\n\r\nCrates of Pergamus relates, that there formerly existed in the vicinity\r\nof Parium, in the Hellespont, a race of men whom he calls Ophiogenes,\r\nand that by their touch they were able to cure those who had been\r\nstung by serpents, extracting the poison by the mere imposition of the\r\nhand.[877] Varro tells us, that there are still a few individuals in\r\nthat district, whose saliva effectually cures the stings of serpents.\r\nThe same, too, was the case with the tribe of the Psylli,[878] in\r\nAfrica, according to the account of Agatharchides; these people\r\nreceived their name from Psyllus, one of their kings, whose tomb is\r\nin existence, in the district of the Greater Syrtes. In the bodies of\r\nthese people there was by nature a certain kind of poison, which was\r\nfatal to serpents, and the odour of which overpowered them with torpor:\r\nwith them it was a custom to expose children immediately after their\r\nbirth to the fiercest serpents, and in this manner to make proof of\r\nthe fidelity of their wives, the serpents not being repelled by such\r\nchildren as were the offspring of adultery.[879] This nation, however,\r\nwas almost entirely extirpated by the slaughter made of them by the\r\nNasamones, who now occupy their territory.[880] This race, however,\r\nstill survives in a few persons who are descendants of those who either\r\ntook to flight or else were absent on the occasion of the battle. The\r\nMarsi, in Italy, are still in possession of the same power, for which,\r\nit is said, they are indebted to their origin from the son of Circe,\r\nfrom whom they acquired it as a natural quality. But the fact is, that\r\nall men possess in their bodies a poison which acts upon serpents, and\r\nthe human saliva, it is said, makes them take to flight, as though they\r\nhad been touched with boiling water. The same substance, it is said,\r\ndestroys them the moment it enters their throat, and more particularly\r\nso, if it should happen to be the saliva of a man who is fasting.[881]\r\n\r\nAbove the Nasamones,[882] and the Machlyæ, who border upon them, are\r\nfound, as we learn from Calliphanes, the nation of the Androgyni, a\r\npeople who unite the two sexes in the same individual, and alternately\r\nperform the functions of each. Aristotle also states, that their right\r\nbreast is that of a male, the left that of a female.[883]\r\n\r\nIsigonus and Nymphodorus inform us that there are in Africa certain\r\nfamilies of enchanters,[884] who, by means of their charms, in the\r\nform, of commendations, can cause cattle to perish, trees to wither,\r\nand infants to die. Isigonus adds, that there are among the Triballi\r\nand the Illyrii, some persons of this description, who also have the\r\npower of fascination with the eyes, and can even kill those on whom\r\nthey fix their gaze for any length of time, more especially if their\r\nlook denotes anger; the age of puberty is said to be particularly\r\nobnoxious to the malign influence of such persons.[885]\r\n\r\nA still more remarkable circumstance is, the fact that these persons\r\nhave two pupils in each eye.[886] Apollonides says, that there are\r\ncertain females of this description in Scythia, who are known as\r\nBythiæ, and Phylarchus states that a tribe of the Thibii in Pontus,\r\nand many other persons as well, have a double pupil in one eye, and in\r\nthe other the figure of a horse.[887] He also remarks, that the bodies\r\nof these persons will not sink in water,[888] even though weighed down\r\nby their garments. Damon gives an account of a race of people, not\r\nvery much unlike them, the Pharnaces of Æthiopia, whose perspiration\r\nis productive of consumption[889] to the body of every person that it\r\ntouches. Cicero also, one of our own writers, makes the remark, that\r\nthe glances of all women who have a double pupil is noxious.[890]\r\n\r\nTo this extent, then, has nature, when she produced in man, in common\r\nwith the wild beasts, a taste for human flesh, thought fit to produce\r\npoisons as well in every part of his body, and in the eyes even of\r\nsome persons, taking care that there should be no evil influence in\r\nexistence, which was not to be found in the human body. Not far from\r\nthe city of Rome, in the territory of the Falisci, a few families are\r\nfound, who are known by the name of Hirpi. These people perform a\r\nyearly sacrifice to Apollo, on Mount Soracte, on which occasion they\r\nwalk over a burning pile of wood, without being scorched even. On this\r\naccount, by virtue of a decree of the senate, they are always exempted\r\nfrom military service, and from all other public duties.[891]\r\n\r\nSome individuals, again, are born with certain parts of the body\r\nendowed with properties of a marvellous nature. Such was the case with\r\nKing Pyrrhus, the great toe of whose right foot cured diseases of the\r\nspleen, merely by touching the patient.[892] We are also informed,\r\nthat this toe could not be reduced to ashes together with the other\r\nportions of his body; upon which it was placed in a coffer, and\r\npreserved in a temple.\r\n\r\nIndia, and the region of Æthiopia more especially, abounds in\r\nwonders.[893] In India the largest of animals are produced; their\r\ndogs,[894] for example, are much bigger than those of any other\r\ncountry.[895] The trees, too, are said to be of such vast height,\r\nthat it is impossible to send an arrow over them. This is the result\r\nof the singular fertility of the soil, the equable temperature of the\r\natmosphere, and the abundance of water; which, if we are to believe\r\nwhat is said, are such, that a single fig-tree[896] is capable of\r\naffording shelter to a whole troop of horse. The reeds here are also of\r\nsuch enormous length, that each portion of them, between the joints,\r\nforms a tube, of which a boat is made that is capable of holding three\r\nmen.[897] It is a well-known fact, that many of the people here are\r\nmore than five cubits in height.[898] These people never expectorate,\r\nare subject to no pains, either in the head, the teeth, or the eyes,\r\nand rarely in any other parts of the body; so well is the heat of the\r\nsun calculated to strengthen the constitution. Their philosophers,\r\nwho are called Gymnosophists, remain in one posture, with their eyes\r\nimmovably fixed upon the sun, from its rising to its setting, and,\r\nduring the whole of the day, they are accustomed to stand in the\r\nburning sands on one foot, first one and then the other.[899] According\r\nto the account of Megasthenes, dwelling upon a mountain called Nulo,\r\nthere is a race of men who have their feet turned backwards,[900] with\r\neight toes on each foot.[901]\r\n\r\nOn many of the mountains again, there is a tribe of men who have the\r\nheads of dogs,[902] and clothe themselves with the skins of wild\r\nbeasts. Instead of speaking, they bark; and, furnished with claws,\r\nthey live by hunting and catching birds. According to the story, as\r\ngiven by Ctesias, the number of these people is more than a hundred\r\nand twenty thousand: and the same author tells us, that there is a\r\ncertain race in India, of which the females are pregnant once only in\r\nthe course of their lives, and that the hair of the children becomes\r\nwhite the instant they are born. He speaks also of another race of men,\r\nwho are known as Monocoli,[903] who have only one leg, but are able\r\nto leap with surprising agility.[904] The same people are also called\r\nSciapodæ,[905] because they are in the habit of lying on their backs,\r\nduring the time of the extreme heat, and protect themselves from the\r\nsun by the shade of their feet. These people, he says, dwell not very\r\nfar from the Troglodytæ;[906] to the west of whom again there is a\r\ntribe who are without necks, and have eyes in their shoulders.[907]\r\n\r\nAmong the mountainous districts of the eastern parts of India, in what\r\nis called the country of the Catharcludi, we find the Satyr,[908] an\r\nanimal of extraordinary swiftness. These go sometimes on four feet,\r\nand sometimes walk erect; they have also the features of a human\r\nbeing. On account of their swiftness, these creatures are never to\r\nbe caught, except when they are either aged or sickly. Tauron gives\r\nthe name of Choromandæ to a nation which dwell in the woods and have\r\nno proper voice. These people screech in a frightful manner; their\r\nbodies are covered with hair, their eyes are of a sea-green colour,\r\nand their teeth like those of the dog.[909] Eudoxus tells us, that\r\nin the southern parts of India, the men have feet a cubit in length;\r\nwhile those of the women are so remarkably small, that they are called\r\nStruthopodes.[910]\r\n\r\nMegasthenes places among the Nomades[911] of India, a people who are\r\ncalled Scyritæ. These have merely holes in their faces instead of\r\nnostrils, and flexible feet, like the body of the serpent. At the very\r\nextremity of India, on the eastern side, near the source of the river\r\nGanges, there is the nation of the Astomi, a people who have no mouths;\r\ntheir bodies are rough and hairy, and they cover themselves with a\r\ndown[912] plucked from the leaves of trees. These people subsist only\r\nby breathing and by the odours which they inhale through the nostrils.\r\nThey support themselves upon neither meat nor drink; when they go upon\r\na long journey they only carry with them various odoriferous roots and\r\nflowers, and wild apples,[913] that they may not be without something\r\nto smell at. But an odour, which is a little more powerful than usual,\r\neasily destroys them.[914]\r\n\r\nBeyond these people, and at the very extremity of the mountains, the\r\nTrispithami[915] and the Pygmies are said to exist; two races which\r\nare but three spans in height, that is to say, twenty-seven inches\r\nonly. They enjoy a salubrious atmosphere, and a perpetual spring, being\r\nsheltered by the mountains from the northern blasts; it is these people\r\nthat Homer[916] has mentioned as being waged war upon by cranes. It\r\nis said, that they are in the habit of going down every spring to the\r\nsea-shore, in a large body, seated on the backs of rams and goats,\r\nand armed with arrows, and there destroy the eggs and the young of\r\nthose birds; that this expedition occupies them for the space of three\r\nmonths, and that otherwise it would be impossible for them to withstand\r\nthe increasing multitudes of the cranes. Their cabins, it is said, are\r\nbuilt of mud, mixed with feathers and egg-shells. Aristotle, indeed,\r\nsays, that they dwell in caves; but, in all other respects, he gives\r\nthe same details as other writers.[917]\r\n\r\nIsigonus informs us, that the Cyrni, a people of India, live to their\r\nfour hundredth year; and he is of opinion that the same is the case\r\nalso with the Æthiopian Macrobii,[918] the Seræ, and the inhabitants\r\nof Mount Athos.[919] In the case of these last, it is supposed to\r\nbe owing to the flesh of vipers, which they use as food;[920] in\r\nconsequence of which, they are free also from all noxious animals, both\r\nin their hair and their garments.\r\n\r\nAccording to Onesicritus, in those parts of India where there is\r\nno shadow,[921] the bodies of men attain a height of five cubits\r\nand two palms,[922] and their life is prolonged to one hundred and\r\nthirty years; they die without any symptoms of old age, and just as\r\nif they were in the middle period of life. Crates of Pergamus calls\r\nthe Indians, whose age exceeds one hundred years, by the name of\r\nGymnetæ;[923] but not a few authors style them Macrobii. Ctesias\r\nmentions a tribe of them, known by the name of Pandore, whose locality\r\nis in the valleys, and who live to their two hundredth year; their\r\nhair is white in youth, and becomes black in old age.[924] On the\r\nother hand, there are some people joining up to the country of the\r\nMacrobii, who never live beyond their fortieth year, and their females\r\nhave children once only during their lives. This circumstance is\r\nalso mentioned by Agatharchides, who states, in addition, that they\r\nlive[925] on locusts,[926] and are very swift of foot. Clitarchus and\r\nMegasthenes give these people the name of Mandi, and enumerate as many\r\nas three hundred villages which belong to them. Their women are capable\r\nof bearing children in the seventh year of their age, and become old at\r\nforty.[927]\r\n\r\nArtemidorus states that in the island of Taprobane,[928] life is\r\nprolonged to an extreme length, while, at the same time, the body is\r\nexempt from weakness. According to Durisis, some of the Indians have\r\nconnection with beasts, and from this union a mixture of half man, half\r\nbeast, is produced.[929] Among the Calingæ, a nation also of India,\r\nthe women conceive at five years of age, and do not live beyond their\r\neighth year.[930] In other places again, there are men born with long\r\nhairy tails,[931] and of remarkable swiftness of foot; while there are\r\nothers that have ears so large as to cover the whole body.[932]\r\n\r\nThe Oritæ are divided from the Indians by the river Arabis;[933] they\r\nare acquainted with no food whatever except fish, which they are in\r\nthe habit of tearing to pieces with their nails, and drying in the\r\nsun.[934] Crates of Pergamus states, that the Troglodytæ, who dwell\r\nbeyond Æthiopia, are able to outrun the horse; and that a tribe of the\r\nÆthiopians, who are known as the Syrbotæ, exceed eight cubits in height.\r\n\r\nThere is a tribe of Æthiopian Nomades dwelling on the banks of the\r\nriver Astragus, towards the north, and about twenty days’ journey from\r\nthe ocean. These people are called Menismini; they live on the milk of\r\nthe animal which we call cynocephalus,[935] and rear large flocks of\r\nthese creatures, taking care to kill the males, except such as they may\r\npreserve for the purpose of breeding. In the deserts of Africa, men are\r\nfrequently seen to all appearance, and then vanish in an instant.[936]\r\n\r\nNature, in her ingenuity, has created all these marvels in the human\r\nrace, with others of a similar nature, as so many amusements to\r\nherself, though they appear miraculous to us. But who is there that\r\ncan enumerate all the things that she brings to pass each day, I may\r\nalmost say each hour? As a striking evidence of her power, let it\r\nbe sufficient for me to have cited whole nations in the list of her\r\nprodigies.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to mention some other particulars connected with\r\nMan, the truth of which is universally admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—MARVELLOUS BIRTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3.) That three children are sometimes produced at one birth, is\r\na well-known fact; the case, for instance, of the Horatii and the\r\nCuriatii. Where a greater number of children than this is produced\r\nat one birth, it is looked upon as portentous, except, indeed, in\r\nEgypt, where the water of the river Nile, which is used for drink, is\r\na promoter of fecundity.[937] Very recently, towards the close of the\r\nreign of the Emperor Augustus, now deified, a certain woman of the\r\nlower orders, at Ostia, whose name was Fausta, brought into the world,\r\nat one birth, two male children and two females, a presage, no doubt,\r\nof the famine which shortly after took place. We find it stated, also,\r\nthat in Peloponnesus, a woman was delivered of five[938] children at\r\na birth four successive times, and that the greater part of all these\r\nchildren survived. Trogus informs us, that in Egypt,[939] as many as\r\nseven children are occasionally produced at one birth.[940]\r\n\r\nIndividuals are occasionally born, who belong to both sexes; such\r\npersons we call by the name of hermaphrodites;[941] they were formerly\r\ncalled Androgyni, and were looked upon as monsters,[942] but at the\r\npresent day they are employed for sensual purposes.[943]\r\n\r\nPompeius Magnus, among the decorations of his theatre,[944] erected\r\ncertain statues of remarkable persons, which had been executed with the\r\ngreatest care by artists of the very highest reputation. Among others,\r\nwe here read an inscription to the following effect: “Eutychis,[945] of\r\nTralles,[946] was borne to the funeral pile by twenty of her children,\r\nhaving had thirty in all.”[947] Also, Alcippe[948] was delivered of\r\nan elephant[949]—but then that must be looked upon as a prodigy; as\r\nin the case, too, where, at the commencement of the Marsian war,[950]\r\na female slave was delivered of a serpent.[951] Among these monstrous\r\nbirths, also, there are beings produced which unite in one body the\r\nforms of several creatures. For instance, Claudius Cæsar informs us, in\r\nhis writings, that a Hippocentaur was born in Thessaly, but died on the\r\nsame day: and indeed I have seen one myself, which in the reign of that\r\nemperor was brought to him from Egypt, preserved in honey.[952] We have\r\na case, also, of a child at Saguntum, which returned immediately into\r\nits mother’s womb, the same year in which that place was destroyed by\r\nHannibal.\r\n\r\n(4.) The change of females into males is undoubtedly no fable. We find\r\nit stated in the Annals, that, in the consulship of P. Licinius Crassus\r\nand C. Cassius Longinus,[953] a girl, who was living at Casinum[954]\r\nwith her parents, was changed into a boy; and that, by the command\r\nof the Aruspices, he was conveyed away to a desert island. Licinius\r\nMucianus informs us, that he once saw at Argos a person whose name was\r\nthen Arescon, though he had been formerly called Arescusa: that this\r\nperson had been married to a man, but that, shortly after, a beard and\r\nmarks of virility made their appearance, upon which he took to himself\r\na wife. He had also seen a boy at Smyrna,[955] to whom the very same\r\nthing had happened. I myself saw in Africa one L. Cossicius, a citizen\r\nof Thysdris,[956] who had been changed into a man the very day on which\r\nhe was married to a husband.[957] When women are delivered of twins, it\r\nrarely happens but that either the mother herself, or one, at least,\r\nof the twins perishes.[958] If, however, the twins should happen to be\r\nof different sexes, it is less probable that both of them will survive.\r\nFemale children are matured more quickly than males,[959] and become\r\nold sooner. Of the two, male children most frequently are known to\r\nmove in the womb;[960] they mostly lie on the right side of the body,\r\nfemales on the left.[961]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (5.)—THE GENERATION OF MAN; UNUSUAL DURATION OF PREGNANCY;\r\nINSTANCES OF IT FROM SEVEN TO TWELVE MONTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other animals the period of gestation and of birth is fixed and\r\ndefinite, while man, on the other hand, is born at all seasons of the\r\nyear,[962] and without any certain period of gestation;[963] for one\r\nchild is born at the seventh month, another at the eighth, and so on,\r\neven to the beginning of the tenth and eleventh. Those children which\r\nare born before the seventh month are never known to survive;[964]\r\nunless, indeed, they happen to have been conceived the day before or\r\nthe day after the full moon, or at the change of the moon. In Egypt\r\nit is not an uncommon thing for children to be born at the eighth\r\nmonth; and in Italy, too, children that are born at this period live\r\njust as long as others, notwithstanding the opinions of the ancients\r\nto the contrary. There are great variations in this respect, which\r\noccur in numerous ways. Vestilia, for instance, who was the wife of\r\nC. Herdicius, and was afterwards married, first, to Pomponius,[965]\r\nand then to Orfitus, very eminent citizens, after having brought forth\r\nfour children, always at the seventh month, had Suillius Rufus at the\r\neleventh month, and then Corbulo at the seventh, both of whom became\r\nconsuls; after which, at the eighth month, she had Cæsonia, who became\r\nthe wife of the Emperor Caius.[966] As for children who are born at the\r\neighth month, the greatest difficulty with them is to get them over the\r\nfirst forty days.[967] Pregnant women, on the other hand, are in the\r\ngreatest danger during the fourth and the eighth month, and abortions\r\nduring these periods are fatal. Masurius informs us, that L. Papirius,\r\nthe prætor, on one occasion, when the next but one in succession\r\nwas urging his suit at law, decided against him, in favour of the\r\nheir,[968] although his mother declared that her period of gestation\r\nhad lasted thirteen months—upon the ground that it did not appear that\r\nthere was any fixed and definite period of gestation.[969]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (6.)—INDICATIONS OF THE SEX OF THE CHILD DURING THE PREGNANCY\r\nOF THE MOTHER.[970]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day after conception, pains are felt in the head, vertigo,\r\nand dimness of the sight; these signs, together with loathing of food\r\nand rising of the stomach, indicate the formation of the future human\r\nbeing. If it is a male that is conceived, the colour of the pregnant\r\nwoman is more healthy,[971] and the birth less painful: the child\r\nmoves in the womb upon the fortieth day. In the conception of a child\r\nof the other sex, all the symptoms are totally different: the mother\r\nexperiences an almost insupportable weight, there is a slight swelling\r\nof the legs and the groin, and the first movement of the child is not\r\nfelt until the ninetieth day. But, whatever the sex of the child, the\r\nmother is sensible of the greatest languor at the time when the hair\r\nof the fœtus first begins to grow, and at the full moon; at which\r\nlatter time it is that children newly born are exposed to the greatest\r\ndanger. In addition to this, the mode of walking, and indeed everything\r\nthat can be mentioned, is of consequence in the case of a woman who\r\nis pregnant. Thus, for instance, women who have used too much salted\r\nmeat will bring forth children without nails: parturition, too, is more\r\ndifficult, if they do not hold their breath. It is fatal, too, to yawn\r\nduring labour;[972] and abortion ensues, if the female should happen to\r\nsneeze just after the sexual congress.\r\n\r\n(7.) It is a subject for pity, and even for a feeling of shame, when\r\none reflects that the origin of the most vain of all animated beings\r\nis thus frail: so much so, indeed, that very often the smell even\r\nof a lamp just extinguished is a cause of abortion.[973] From such\r\nbeginnings as these springs the tyrant, from such the murderous\r\ndispositions of men. Thou man, who placest thy confidence in the\r\nstrength of thy body, thou, who dost embrace the gifts of Fortune, and\r\nlook upon thyself, not only as her fosterling, but even as her own born\r\nchild, thou, whose mind is ever thirsting for blood,[974] thou who,\r\npuffed up with some success or other, dost think thyself a god—by how\r\ntrifling a thing might thy life have been cut short! Even this very\r\nday, something still less even may have the same effect, the puncture,\r\nfor instance, of the tiny sting of the serpent; or even, as befell the\r\npoet Anacreon,[975] the swallowing of the stone of a raisin, or of a\r\nsingle hair in a draught of milk, by which the prætor and senator,\r\nFabius, was choked, and so met his death. He only, in fact, will be\r\nable to form a just estimate of the value of life, who will always bear\r\nin mind the extreme frailty of its tenure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (8.)—MONSTROUS BIRTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is contrary to nature for children to come into the world with\r\nthe feet first, for which reason such children are called Agrippæ,\r\nmeaning that they are born with difficulty.[976] In this manner, M.\r\nAgrippa[977] is said to have been born; the only instance, almost, of\r\ngood fortune, out of the number of all those who have come into the\r\nworld under these circumstances. And yet, even he may be considered\r\nto have paid the penalty of the unfavourable omen produced by the\r\nunnatural mode of his birth, in the unfortunate weakness of his legs,\r\nthe misfortunes of his youth, a life spent in the very midst of arms\r\nand slaughter, and ever exposed to the approaches of death; in his\r\nchildren, too, who have all proved a very curse to the earth, and more\r\nespecially, the two Agrippinas, who were the mothers respectively of\r\nCaius and of Domitius Nero,[978] so many firebrands hurled among the\r\nhuman race. In addition to all this, we may add the shortness of his\r\nlife, he being cut off in his fifty-first year, the distress which he\r\nexperienced from the adulteries of his wife,[979] and the grievous\r\ntyranny to which he was subjected by his father-in-law. Agrippina, too,\r\nthe mother of Nero, who was lately Emperor, and who proved himself,\r\nthroughout the whole of his reign, the enemy of the human race, has\r\nleft it recorded in writing, that he was born with his feet first. It\r\nis in the due order of nature that man should enter the world with the\r\nhead first, and be carried to the tomb in a contrary fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (9.)—OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose children, whose birth has cost the mother her life, are evidently\r\nborn under more favourable auspices; for such was the case with the\r\nfirst Scipio Africanus; the first, too, of the Cæsars was so named,\r\nfrom his having been removed by an incision in his mother’s womb. For\r\na similar reason, too, the Cæsones were called by that name.[980]\r\nManilius, also, who entered Carthage with his army, was born in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (10.)—WHO WERE CALLED VOPISCI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA child used to be called Vopiscus,[981] who, when twins had been\r\nconceived, had been retained in the womb and born alive, the other\r\nhaving perished by abortion. There are, too, some very remarkable\r\ninstances of this kind, although they are singularly rare and uncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (11.)—THE CONCEPTION AND GENERATION OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew animals, except the female of the human species, receive the\r\nmale when pregnant. In only one or two species, and no more, does\r\nsuperfœtation ever take place.[982] Cases are to be found stated in\r\nthe journals of physicians, and of others who have paid particular\r\nattention to the subject, in which twelve embryos[983] have been\r\nremoved at a single abortion. When, however, but a very short time has\r\nintervened between two conceptions, the embryos both of them proceed\r\nto maturity; as was seen to be the case with Hercules and his brother\r\nIphicles.[984] This was the case also with the woman who brought\r\nforth two children at a birth, one of whom bore a resemblance to her\r\nhusband, and the other to her paramour. So too, with a female slave in\r\nProconnesus,[985] who was delivered of two children at one birth, one\r\nof whom bore a strong resemblance to her master, and the other to her\r\nmaster’s steward, with both of whom she had had connection on the same\r\nday; with another woman who was delivered of two children at a birth,\r\nthe one after the usual period of gestation, the other an embryo only\r\nfive months old: and again, with another female, who, having been\r\ndelivered of one child at the end of seven months, in due course, two\r\nmonths afterwards, brought forth twins.[986]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—STRIKING INSTANCES OF RESEMBLANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is universally known that well-formed parents often produce\r\ndefective children; and on the other hand, defective parents children\r\nwho are well formed, or else imperfect in the same part of the body\r\nas the parents. It is a well-known fact also, that marks, moles, and\r\neven scars, are reproduced in members of the same family in successive\r\ngenerations. The mark which the Daci make on their arms for the\r\npurpose of denoting their origin, is known to last even to the fourth\r\ngeneration.[987]\r\n\r\n(12.) We have heard it stated that three members of the family of the\r\nLepidi have been born, though not in an uninterrupted succession, with\r\none of the eyes covered with a membrane.[988] We observe, too, that\r\nsome children strongly resemble their grandfather, and that of twins\r\none child is like the father, while the other resembles the mother;\r\nand have known cases where a child that was born a year after another,\r\nresembled him as exactly as though they had been twins. Some women\r\nhave children like themselves, some like their husband, while others\r\nagain bear children who resemble neither the one nor the other. In\r\nsome cases the female children resemble the father, and the males the\r\nmother. The case of Nicæus, the celebrated wrestler of Byzantium, is\r\na well-known and undoubted instance. His mother was the produce of\r\nan act of adultery, committed with a male of Æthiopia; and although\r\nshe herself differed in no way from the ordinary complexion of other\r\nfemales, he was born with all the swarthy complexion of his Æthiopian\r\ngrandfather.[989]\r\n\r\nThese strong features of resemblance proceed, no doubt, from the\r\nimagination of the parents, over which we may reasonably believe\r\nthat many casual circumstances have a very powerful influence; such,\r\nfor instance, as the action of the eyes, the ears, or the memory,\r\nor impressions received at the moment of conception. A thought[990]\r\neven, momentarily passing through the mind of either of the parents,\r\nmay be supposed to produce a resemblance to one of them separately,\r\nor else to the two combined. Hence it is that the varieties are much\r\nmore numerous in the appearance of man than in that of other animals;\r\nseeing that, in the former, the rapidity of the ideas, the quickness\r\nof the perception, and the varied powers of the intellect, tend to\r\nimpress upon the features peculiar and diversified marks; while in\r\nthe case of the other animals, the mind is immovable, and just the\r\nsame in each and all individuals of the same species.[991] A man named\r\nArtemon, one of the common people,[992] bore so strong a resemblance\r\nto Antiochus, the king of Syria, that his queen Laodice, after her\r\nhusband Antiochus was slain, acted the farce of getting this man[993]\r\nto recommend her as the successor to the crown. Vibius, a member\r\nof the plebeian order,[994] and Publicius as well, a freedman who\r\nhad formerly been a slave, so strongly resembled Pompeius Magnus in\r\nappearance as to be scarcely distinguishable from him; they both had\r\nthat ingenuous countenance[995] of his, and that fine forehead,[996]\r\nwhich so strongly bespoke his noble descent. It was a similar degree of\r\nresemblance to this, that caused the surname of his cook, Menogenes, to\r\nbe given to the father of Pompeius Magnus, he having already obtained\r\nthat of Strabo, on account of the cast in his eye,[997] a defect\r\nwhich he had contracted through imitating a similar one in his slave.\r\nScipio, too, had the name of Serapion given him, after the vile slave\r\nof a pig-jobber: and after him, another Scipio of the same family was\r\nsurnamed Salvitto, after a mime[998] of that name. In the same way,\r\ntoo, Spinther and Pamphilus, who were respectively actors of only\r\nsecond and third rate parts, gave their names to Lentulus and Metellus,\r\nwho were at that time colleagues in the consulship; so that, by a very\r\ncurious but disagreeable coincidence, the likenesses of the two consuls\r\nwere to be seen at the same moment on the stage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand again, L. Plancus, the orator, bestowed his surname\r\non the actor Rubrius: the player, Burbuleius, again, gave his name\r\nto the elder Curio, and the player, Menogenes, to Messala, the\r\ncensor.[999] There was a certain fisherman, too, a native of Sicily,\r\nwho bore a strong resemblance to the proconsul, Sura, not only in\r\nhis features, but in the mode even of opening his mouth, and the\r\nspasmodic contraction of his tongue, and his hurried and indistinct\r\nutterance when speaking. Cassius Severus,[1000] the celebrated orator,\r\nhad it thrown in his teeth how strongly he resembled Armentarius, the\r\ngladiator.[1001] Toranius, a slave-dealer, sold to Antony, while he was\r\none of the Triumvirs, two boys of remarkable beauty, as being twins,\r\nso strong was their resemblance; whereas, in reality, one of them was\r\nborn in Asia, and the other beyond the Alps. The fraud, however, having\r\nbeen soon afterwards discovered through the difference in the language\r\nof the youths, Antony, who was greatly exasperated, violently upbraided\r\nthe dealer, and, among other things, complained that he had fixed the\r\nprice at so high a sum as two hundred thousand sesterces.[1002] The\r\ncrafty slave-merchant, however, made answer that that was the very\r\nreason for his having set so high a price upon them; for, as he said,\r\nthere would have been nothing particularly striking in the resemblance\r\nof the boys, if they had been born of the same mother, whereas,\r\nchildren found to be so exactly like each other, though natives of\r\ndifferent countries, ought to be deemed above all price; an answer\r\nwhich produced such a reasonable feeling of surprise and admiration\r\nin the mind of the proscriber,[1003] that he who was but just before\r\nfrantic under the injury he had received, was led to set a higher value\r\non no part whatever of all the property in his possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (13.)—WHAT MEN ARE SUITED FOR GENERATION. INSTANCES OF VERY\r\nNUMEROUS OFFSPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere exists a kind of peculiar antipathy between the bodies of\r\ncertain persons, which, though barren with respect to each other, are\r\nnot so when united to others;[1004] such, for instance, was the case\r\nwith Augustus and Livia.[1005] Certain individuals, again, both men and\r\nwomen, produce only females, others males; and, still more frequently,\r\nchildren of the two sexes alternately; the mother of the Gracchi,\r\nfor instance, who had twelve children, and Agrippina, the mother of\r\nGermanicus, who had nine. Some women, again, are barren in their youth,\r\nwhile to others it is given to bring forth once only during their\r\nlives. Some women never go to their full time, or if, by dint of great\r\ncare and the aid of medicine, they do give birth to a living child,\r\nit is mostly a girl. Among other instances of rare occurrence, is the\r\ncase of Augustus, now deified, who, in the year in which he departed\r\nthis life, witnessed the birth of M. Silanus,[1006] the grandson of\r\nhis grand-daughter: having obtained the government of Asia, after his\r\nconsulship, he was poisoned by Nero, on his accession to the throne.\r\n\r\nQ. Metellus Macedonicus,[1007] leaving six children, left eleven\r\ngrandsons also, with daughters-in-law and sons-in-law,[1008]\r\ntwenty-seven individuals in all, who addressed him by the name and\r\ntitle of father. In the records of the times of the Emperor Augustus,\r\nnow deified, we find it stated that, in his twelfth consulship,\r\nLucius Sylla being his colleague, on the third day before the ides\r\nof April,[1009] C. Crispinus Hilarus, a man of a respectable family\r\nof the plebeian order, living at Fæesulæ,[1010] came to the Capitol,\r\nto offer sacrifice, attended by eight children (of whom two were\r\ndaughters), twenty-eight grandsons, nineteen great-grandsons, and eight\r\ngranddaughters, who all followed him in a lengthened train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (14.)—AT WHAT AGE GENERATION CEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen cease to bear children at their fiftieth year, and, with the\r\ngreater part of them, the monthly discharge ceases at the age of forty.\r\nBut with respect to the male sex, it is a well-known fact, that King\r\nMasinissa, when he was past his eighty-sixth year, had a son born to\r\nhim, whom he named Metimanus,[1011] and that Cato the Censor, after\r\nhe had completed his eightieth year, had a son by the daughter of his\r\nclient, Salonius: a circumstance from which, while the descendants of\r\nhis other sons were surnamed Liciniani, those of this son were called\r\nSaloniani, of whom Cato of Utica was one.[1012] It is equally well\r\nknown, too, that L. Volusius Saturninus,[1013] who lately died while\r\nprefect of the city, had a son when he was past his seventy-second\r\nyear,[1014] by Cornelia, a member of the family of the Scipios,\r\nVolusius Saturninus, who was afterwards consul. Among the lower classes\r\nof the people, we not uncommonly meet with men who become the fathers\r\nof children after the age of seventy-five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (15.)—REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE MENSTRUAL\r\nDISCHARGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the whole range of animated beings, the human female is the\r\nonly one that has the monthly discharge,[1015] and in whose womb are\r\nfound what we term “moles.” These moles consist of a shapeless mass of\r\nflesh, devoid of all life, and capable of resisting either the edge\r\nor the point of the knife; they are movable in the body, and obstruct\r\nthe menstrual discharge; sometimes, too, they are productive of fatal\r\nconsequences to the woman, in the same manner as a real fœtus; while,\r\nat other times, they remain in the body until old age; in some cases,\r\nagain, they are discharged, in consequence of an increased action of\r\nthe bowels.[1016] Something of a very similar nature is produced in the\r\nbody of the male, which is called a “schirrus;”[1017] this was the case\r\nwith Oppius Capito, a man of prætorian rank.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be a difficult matter to find anything which\r\nis productive of more marvellous effects than the menstrual\r\ndischarge.[1018] On the approach of a woman in this state, must will\r\nbecome sour, seeds which are touched by her become sterile, grafts\r\nwither away, garden plants are parched up, and the fruit will fall\r\nfrom the tree beneath which she sits. Her very look, even, will dim\r\nthe brightness of mirrors, blunt the edge of steel, and take away the\r\npolish from ivory. A swarm of bees, if looked upon by her, will die\r\nimmediately; brass and iron will instantly become rusty, and emit an\r\noffensive odour; while dogs which may have tasted of the matter so\r\ndischarged are seized with madness, and their bite is venomous and\r\nincurable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the bitumen which is found at certain periods\r\nof the year, floating on the lake of Judæa, known as Asphaltites, a\r\nsubstance which is peculiarly tenacious, and adheres to everything that\r\nit touches, can only be divided into separate pieces by means of a\r\nthread which has been dipped in this virulent matter.[1019] It is said\r\nthat the ant, even an insect so extremely minute, is sensible of its\r\npresence, and rejects the grains which it has been carrying, and will\r\nnot return to them again.[1020]\r\n\r\nThis discharge, which is productive of such great and singular effects,\r\noccurs in women every thirty days, and in a greater degree every three\r\nmonths.[1021] In some individuals it occurs oftener than once a month,\r\nand in others, again, it never takes place. Women of this nature,\r\nhowever, are not capable of bearing children, because it is of this\r\nsubstance that the infant is formed.[1022] The seed of the male, acting\r\nas a sort of leaven, causes it to unite and assume a form, and in due\r\ntime it acquires life, and assumes a bodily shape. The consequence is,\r\nthat if the flow continues during pregnancy, the child will be weak, or\r\nelse will not live; or if it does, it will be full of gross humours,\r\nNigidius says.\r\n\r\n(16.) The same author is also of opinion, that the milk of a woman who\r\nis giving suck will not become impure, if she should happen to become\r\npregnant again by the same man.[1023]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—THE THEORY OF GENERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nConception is generally said to take place the most readily, either at\r\nthe beginning or the end of the menstrual discharge.[1024] It is said,\r\ntoo, that it is a certain sign of fecundity in a woman, when her saliva\r\nbecomes impregnated with any medicament which has been rubbed upon her\r\neye-lids.[1025]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—SOME ACCOUNT OF THE TEETH, AND SOME FACTS CONCERNING INFANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter beyond doubt, that in young children the front teeth\r\nare produced at the seventh month, and, nearly always, those in the\r\nupper jaw the first. These are shed in the seventh year, and are then\r\nreplaced by others.[1026] Some infants are even born with teeth:[1027]\r\nsuch was the case with Manius Curius, who, from this circumstance,\r\nreceived the name of Dentatus; and also with Cn. Papirius Carbo,\r\nboth of them distinguished men. When this phenomenon happened in the\r\ncase of a female, it was looked upon in the time of the kings as an\r\nomen of some inauspicious event. At the birth of Valeria, under such\r\ncircumstances as these, it was the answer of the soothsayers, that\r\nany city to which she might happen to be carried, would be destroyed;\r\nshe was sent to Suessa Pometia,[1028] at that time a very flourishing\r\nplace, but the prediction was ultimately verified by its destruction.\r\nSome female children are born with the sexual organs closed,[1029] a\r\nthing of very unfavourable omen; of which Cornelia, the mother of the\r\nGracchi, is an instance. Some persons are born with a continuous bone\r\nin the mouth, in place of teeth; this was the case with the upper jaw\r\nof the son of Prusias, the king of Bithynia.[1030]\r\n\r\nThe teeth are the only parts of the body which resist the action of\r\nfire, and are not consumed along with the rest of it.[1031] Still,\r\nhowever, though they are able thus to resist flame, they become\r\ncorroded by a morbid state of the saliva. The teeth are whitened by\r\ncertain medicinal agents.[1032] They are worn down by use, and fail\r\nin some persons long before any other part of the body. They are\r\nnecessary, not only for the mastication of the food, but for many other\r\npurposes as well. It is the office of the front teeth to regulate\r\nthe voice and the speech; by a certain arrangement, they receive, as\r\nif in concert, the stroke communicated by the tongue, while by their\r\nstructure in such regular order, and their size, they cut short,\r\nmoderate, or soften the utterance of the words. When they are lost,\r\nthe articulation becomes altogether confused and indistinct.[1033]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it is generally supposed that we may form\r\nprognostics from the teeth. The number of teeth allotted to all men,\r\nwith the exception of the nation of the Turduli,[1034] is thirty-two;\r\nthose persons who have a greater number, are thought to be destined to\r\nbe long-lived. Women have fewer teeth than men.[1035] Those females who\r\nhappen to have two canine teeth on the right side of the upper jaw,\r\nhave promise of being the favourites of fortune, as was the case with\r\nAgrippina,[1036] the mother of Domitius Nero: when they are on the left\r\nside, it is just the contrary. It is the custom of most nations not to\r\nburn the bodies of children who die before they have cut their teeth.\r\nWe shall have more to say on this subject when we give an account of\r\nthe different parts of the body.[1037]\r\n\r\nWe find it stated that Zoroaster was the only human being who ever\r\nlaughed on the same day on which he was born. We hear, too, that his\r\nbrain pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it,\r\na presage of his future wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—EXAMPLES OF UNUSUAL SIZE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, that, at the age of three years, the body of\r\neach person is half the height that it will ever attain. Taking it all\r\nin all, it is observed that in the human race, the stature is almost\r\ndaily becoming less and less, and that sons are rarely taller than\r\ntheir parents, the fertility of the seed being dried up by the heat\r\nof that conflagration to which the world is fast approaching.[1038] A\r\nmountain of the island of Crete having been burst asunder by the action\r\nof an earthquake, a body was found there standing upright, forty-six\r\ncubits in height;[1039] by some persons it is supposed to have been\r\nthat of Orion;[1040] while others again are of opinion that it was that\r\nof Otus.[1041] It is generally believed, from what is stated in ancient\r\nrecords, that the body of Orestes, which was disinterred by command\r\nof an oracle, was seven cubits in height.[1042] It is now nearly\r\none thousand years ago, that that divine poet Homer was unceasingly\r\ncomplaining, that men were of less stature in his day than they had\r\nformerly been.[1043] Our Annals do not inform us what was the height\r\nof Nævius Pollio;[1044] but we learn from them that he nearly lost his\r\nlife from the rush of the people to see him, and that he was looked\r\nupon as a prodigy. The tallest man that has been seen in our times,\r\nwas one Gabbaras[1045] by name, who was brought from Arabia by the\r\nEmperor Claudius; his height was nine feet and as many inches.[1046]\r\nIn the reign of Augustus, there were two persons, Posio and Secundilla\r\nby name, who were half a foot taller than him; their bodies have been\r\npreserved as objects of curiosity in the museum of the Sallustian\r\nfamily.[1047]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the same emperor, there was a man also, remarkable for\r\nhis extremely diminutive stature, being only two feet and a palm in\r\nheight; his name was Conopas, and he was a great pet with Julia, the\r\ngrand-daughter of Augustus. There was a female also, of the same size,\r\nAndromeda by name, a freed-woman of Julia Augusta. We learn from Varro,\r\nthat Manius Maximus and M. Tullius, members of our equestrian order,\r\nwere only two cubits in height; and I have myself seen them, preserved\r\nin their coffins.[1048] It is far from an unknown fact, that children\r\nare occasionally born a foot and a half in height, and sometimes a\r\nlittle more; such children, however, have finished their span of\r\nexistence by the time they are three years old.[1049]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—CHILDREN REMARKABLE FOR THEIR PRECOCITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find it stated by the historians, that the son of Euthymenes of\r\nSalamis had grown to be three cubits in height, at the age of three\r\nyears; that he was slow of gait and dull of comprehension; that at that\r\nage he had attained puberty even, and his voice had become strong, like\r\nthat of a man. We hear, also, that he died suddenly of convulsions\r\nof the limbs, at the completion of his third year.[1050] I myself,\r\nnot very long ago, was witness to exactly similar appearances, with\r\nthe exception of the state of puberty, in a son of Cornelius Tacitus,\r\na member of the equestrian order, and procurator[1051] of Belgic\r\nGaul.[1052] The Greeks call such children as these, Ἐκτραπέλοι; we have\r\nno name for them in Latin.\r\n\r\n(17.) It has been observed, that the height of a man from the crown of\r\nthe head to the sole of the foot, is equal to the distance between the\r\ntips of the middle fingers of the two hands when extended in a straight\r\nline; the right side of the body, too, is generally stronger than the\r\nleft; though in some, the strength of the two sides is equal; while in\r\nothers again, the left side is the strongest. This, however, is never\r\nfound to be the case in women.[1053]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—SOME REMARKABLE PROPERTIES OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMales are heavier than females, and the bodies of all animals are\r\nheavier when they are dead than when alive; they also weigh more when\r\nasleep than when awake. The dead bodies of men float upon the back,\r\nthose of women with the face downwards; as if, even after death,\r\nnature were desirous of sparing their modesty.[1054]\r\n\r\n(18.) We find it stated, that there are some men whose bones are solid,\r\nand devoid of marrow,[1055] and that one mark of such persons is the\r\nfact that they are never thirsty, and emit no perspiration. At the\r\nsame time, we know that by the exercise of a resolute determination,\r\nany one may resist the feeling of thirst; a fact which was especially\r\nexemplified in the case of Julius Viator, a Roman of equestrian rank,\r\nbut by birth one of the Vocontii, a nation on terms of alliance with\r\nus. Having, in his youth, been attacked by dropsy, and forbidden the\r\nuse of liquids by his physicians,[1056] use with him became a second\r\nnature, and so, in his old age, he never took any drink at all. Other\r\npersons also, have, by the exercise of a strong determination, laid\r\nsimilar restraints upon themselves.\r\n\r\n(19.) It is said that Crassus, the grandfather of Crassus, who\r\nwas slain by the Parthians, was never known to laugh; from which\r\ncircumstance he obtained the name of Agelastus.[1057] There are other\r\npersons again, who have never been seen to weep. Socrates, who was so\r\nfamous for his wisdom, always appeared with the same countenance, and\r\nwas never known to appear either more gay or more sad than ordinary.\r\nThis even tenor of the mind, however, sometimes degenerates into a\r\nsort of harshness, and a rigorous and inflexible sternness of nature,\r\nentirely effacing all the human affections. The Greeks, among whom\r\nthere have been many persons of this description, are in the habit of\r\ncalling them Ἀπαθεῖς.[1058] A very remarkable thing, too, is the fact,\r\nthat among these persons are to be found some of the greatest masters\r\nof philosophy. Diogenes the Cynic, for instance, Pyrrho, Heraclitus,\r\nand Timon, which last allowed himself to be so entirely carried away\r\nby this spirit, as to become a hater of all mankind. Less important\r\npeculiarities of nature, again, are to be observed in many persons;\r\nAntonia,[1059] for instance, the wife of Drusus, was never known to\r\nexpectorate; and Pomponius, the poet, a man of consular rank, was never\r\ntroubled with eructation. Those rare instances of men,[1060] whose\r\nbones are naturally solid and without marrow, are known to us as men\r\n“of horn.”[1061]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (20.)—INSTANCES OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarro, speaking of persons remarkable for their strength, gives us an\r\naccount of Tributanus, a celebrated gladiator, and skilled in the use\r\nof the Samnite[1062] arms;[1063] he was a man of meagre person, but\r\npossessed of extraordinary strength. Varro makes mention of his son\r\nalso, who served in the army of Pompeius Magnus. He says, that in all\r\nparts of his body, even in the arms and hands, there was a network of\r\nsinews,[1064] extending across and across. The latter of these men,\r\nhaving been challenged by an enemy, with a single finger of the right\r\nhand, and that unarmed,[1065] vanquished him, and then seized and\r\ndragged him to the camp. Vinnius Valens, who served as a centurion in\r\nthe prætorian guard of Augustus, was in the habit of holding up waggons\r\nladen with casks, until they were emptied; and of stopping a carriage\r\nwith one hand, and holding it back, against all the efforts of the\r\nhorses to drag it forward. He performed other wonderful feats also, an\r\naccount of which may still be seen inscribed on his monument. Varro,\r\nalso, gives the following statement: “Fusius, who used to be called the\r\n‘bumpkin[1066] Hercules,’ was in the habit of carrying his own mule;\r\nwhile Salvius was able to mount a ladder, with a weight of two hundred\r\npounds attached to his feet, the same to his hands, and two hundred\r\npounds on each shoulder.” I myself once saw,—a most marvellous display\r\nof strength,—a man of the name of Athanatus walk across the stage,\r\nwearing a leaden breast-plate of five hundred pounds weight, while shod\r\nwith buskins of the same weight. When Milo, the wrestler, had once\r\ntaken his stand, there was not a person who could move him from his\r\nposition; and when he grasped an apple in his hand, no one could so\r\nmuch as open one of his fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE AGILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was considered a very great thing for Philippides to run one\r\nthousand one hundred and sixty stadia, the distance between Athens\r\nand Lacedæmon, in two days, until Amystis, the Lacedæmonian courier,\r\nand Philonides,[1067] the courier of Alexander the Great, ran from\r\nSicyon to Elis in one day, a distance of thirteen hundred and five\r\nstadia.[1068] In our own times, too, we are fully aware that there\r\nare men in the Circus, who are able to keep on running for a distance\r\nof one hundred and sixty miles; and that lately, in the consulship\r\nof Fonteius and Vipstanus,[1069] there was a child eight years of\r\nage, who, between morning and evening, ran a distance of seventy-five\r\nmiles.[1070] We become all the more sensible of these wonderful\r\ninstances of swiftness, upon reflecting that Tiberius Nero, when he\r\nmade all possible haste to reach his brother Drusus, who was then sick\r\nin Germany, reached him in three stages, travelling day and night on\r\nthe road; the distance of each stage was two hundred miles.[1071]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (21.)—INSTANCES OF ACUTENESS OF SIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstances of acuteness of sight are to be found stated, which, indeed,\r\nexceed all belief. Cicero informs us,[1072] that the Iliad of Homer\r\nwas written on a piece of parchment so small as to be enclosed in a\r\nnut-shell. He makes mention also of a man who could distinguish objects\r\nat a distance of one hundred and thirty-five miles.[1073] M. Varro\r\nsays, that the name of this man was Strabo; and that, during the Punic\r\nwar, from Lilybæum, the promontory of Sicily, he was in the habit\r\nof seeing the fleet come out of the harbour of Carthage, and could\r\neven count the number of the vessels.[1074] Callicrates[1075] used\r\nto carve ants and other small animals in ivory, so minute in size,\r\nthat other persons were unable to distinguish their individual parts.\r\nMyrmecides[1076] also was famous in the same line;[1077] this man made,\r\nof similar material, a chariot drawn by four horses, which a fly could\r\ncover with its wings; as well as a ship which might be covered by the\r\nwings of a tiny bee.[1078]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (22.)—INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE ACUTENESS OF HEARING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have one instance on record of remarkable acuteness of hearing; the\r\nnoise of the battle, on the occasion when Sybaris[1079] was destroyed,\r\nwas heard, the day on which it took place, at Olympia.[1080] But, as to\r\nthe victory over the Cimbri,[1081] and that over Perseus, the news of\r\nwhich was conveyed to Rome by the Castors,[1082] they are to be looked\r\nupon in the light of visions and presages proceeding immediately from\r\nthe gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (23.)—INSTANCES OF ENDURANCE OF PAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf patience in enduring pain, that being too frequently the lot of our\r\ncalamitous fate, we have innumerable instances related. One of the most\r\nremarkable instances among the female sex is that of the courtesan\r\nLeæna, who, although put to the torture, refused to betray the\r\ntyrant-slayers, Harmodius and Aristogiton.[1083] Among those of men,\r\nwe have that of Anaxarchus, who, when put to the torture for a similar\r\nreason, bit off his tongue and spit it into the face of the tyrant,\r\nthus destroying the only hope[1084] of his making any betrayal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (24.)—MEMORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be far from easy to pronounce what person has been the most\r\nremarkable for the excellence of his memory, that blessing so essential\r\nfor the enjoyment of life, there having been so many who have been\r\ncelebrated for it. King Cyrus knew all the soldiers of his army by\r\nname:[1085] L. Scipio the names of all the Roman people. Cineas,\r\nthe ambassador of king Pyrrhus, knew by name all the members of the\r\nsenate and the equestrian order, the day after his arrival at Rome.\r\nMithridates,[1086] who was king of twenty-two nations, administered\r\ntheir laws in as many languages, and could harangue each of them,\r\nwithout employing an interpreter. There was in Greece a man named\r\nCharmidas, who, when a person asked him for any book in a library,\r\ncould repeat it by heart, just as though he were reading. Memory, in\r\nfine, has been made an art; which was first invented by the lyric\r\npoet, Simonides,[1087] and perfected by Metrodorus of Scepsis, so\r\nas to enable persons to repeat word for word exactly what they have\r\nheard.[1088] Nothing whatever, in man, is of so frail a nature as\r\nthe memory; for it is affected by disease, by injuries, and even by\r\nfright; being sometimes partially lost, and at other times entirely\r\nso. A man, who received a blow from a stone, forgot the names of the\r\nletters only;[1089] while, on the other hand, another person, who fell\r\nfrom a very high roof, could not so much as recollect his mother,\r\nor his relations and neighbours. Another person, in consequence of\r\nsome disease, forgot his own servants even; and Messala Corvinus, the\r\norator, lost all recollection of his own name. And so it is, that very\r\noften the memory appears to attempt, as it were, to make its escape\r\nfrom us, even while the body is at rest and in perfect health. When\r\nsleep, too, comes over us, it is cut off altogether; so much so, that\r\nthe mind, in its vacancy, is at a loss to know where we are.[1090]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (25.)—VIGOR OF MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable instance, I think, of vigour of mind in any man\r\never born, was that of Cæsar, the Dictator. I am not at present\r\nalluding to his valour and courage, nor yet his exalted genius, which\r\nwas capable of embracing everything under the face of heaven, but I am\r\nspeaking of that innate vigour of mind, which was so peculiar to him,\r\nand that promptness which seemed to act like a flash of lightning. We\r\nfind it stated that he was able to write or read, and, at the same\r\ntime, to dictate and listen. He could dictate to his secretaries\r\nfour letters at once, and those on the most important business; and,\r\nindeed, if he was busy about nothing else, as many as seven. He\r\nfought as many as fifty pitched battles, being the only commander who\r\nexceeded M. Marcellus,[1091] in this respect, he having fought only\r\nthirty-nine.[1092] In addition, too, to the victories gained by him in\r\nthe civil wars, one million one hundred and ninety-two thousand men\r\nwere slain by him in his battles. For my own part, however, I am not\r\ngoing to set it down as a subject for high renown, what was really an\r\noutrage committed upon mankind, even though he may have been acting\r\nunder the strong influence of necessity; and, indeed, he himself\r\nconfesses as much, in his omission to state the number of persons who\r\nperished by the sword in the civil wars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—CLEMENCY AND GREATNESS OF MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith much more justice we may award credit to Pompeius Magnus, for\r\nhaving taken from the pirates[1093] no less than eight hundred and\r\nforty-six vessels: though at the same time, over and above the great\r\nqualities previously mentioned, we must with equal justice give Cæsar\r\nthe peculiar credit of a remarkable degree of clemency, a quality,\r\nin the exercise of which, even to repentance, he excelled all other\r\nindividuals whatsoever. The same person has left us one instance of\r\nmagnanimity, to which there is nothing that can be at all compared.\r\nWhile one, who was an admirer of luxury, might perhaps on this occasion\r\nhave enumerated the spectacles which he exhibited, the treasures which\r\nhe lavished away, and the magnificence of his public works, I maintain\r\nthat it was the great proof, and an incomparable one, of an elevated\r\nmind, for him to have burnt with the most scrupulous carefulness the\r\npapers of Pompeius, which were taken in his desk at the battle of\r\nPharsalia, and those of Scipio, taken at Thapsus, without so much as\r\nreading them.[1094]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (26.)—HEROIC EXPLOITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now, as it belongs fully as much to the glorious renown of the\r\nRoman Empire, as to the victorious career of a single individual, I\r\nshall proceed on this occasion to make mention of all the triumphs\r\nand titles of Pompeius Magnus: the splendour of his exploits having\r\nequalled not only that of those of Alexander the Great, but even\r\nof Hercules, and perhaps of Father Liber[1095] even. After having\r\nrecovered Sicily, where he first commenced his career as a partisan of\r\nSylla, but in behalf of the republic, after having conquered the whole\r\nof Africa, and reduced it to subjection, and after having received for\r\nhis share of the spoil the title of “Great,”[1096] he was decreed the\r\nhonours of a triumph; and he, though only of equestrian rank,[1097]\r\na thing that had never occurred before, re-entered the city in the\r\ntriumphal chariot: immediately after which, he hastened to the west,\r\nwhere he left it inscribed on the trophy which he raised upon the\r\nPyrenees, that he had, by his victories, reduced to subjection eight\r\nhundred and seventy-six cities, from the Alps to the borders of Farther\r\nSpain; at the same time he most magnanimously said not a word about\r\nSertorius.[1098] After having put an end to the civil war, which indeed\r\nwas the primary cause of all the foreign ones, he, though still of only\r\nequestrian rank, again entered Rome in the triumphal chariot, having\r\nproved himself a general thus often before having been a soldier.[1099]\r\nAfter this, he was dispatched to the shores of all the various seas,\r\nand then to the East, whence he brought back to his country the\r\nfollowing titles of honour, resembling therein those who conquer at the\r\nsacred games—for, be it remembered, it is not they that are crowned,\r\nbut their respective countries.[1100] These honours then did he award\r\nto the City, in the temple of Minerva,[1101] which he consecrated from\r\nthe spoils that he had gained: “Cneius Pompeius Magnus, Imperator,\r\nhaving brought to an end a war of thirty years’ duration, and having\r\ndefeated, routed, put to the sword, or received the submission of,\r\ntwelve millions two hundred and seventy-eight thousand men, having\r\nsunk or captured eight hundred and forty-six vessels, having received\r\nas allies one thousand five hundred and thirty-eight cities and\r\nfortresses, and having conquered all the country from the Mæotis to the\r\nRed Sea, dedicates this shrine as a votive offering due to Minerva.”\r\nSuch, in few words, is the sum of his exploits in the East. The\r\nfollowing are the introductory words descriptive of the triumph which\r\nhe obtained, the third day before the calends[1102] of October,[1103]\r\nin the consulship of M. Piso and M. Messala;[1104] “After having\r\ndelivered the sea-coast from the pirates, and restored the seas to\r\nthe people of Rome, he enjoyed a triumph over Asia, Pontus, Armenia,\r\nPaphlagonia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Syria, the Scythians, Judæa, the\r\nAlbanians, Iberia, the island of Crete, the Basterni, and, in addition\r\nto all these, the kings Mithridates and Tigranes.”\r\n\r\nThe most glorious, however, of all glories, resulting from these\r\nexploits, was, as he himself says, in the speech which he made in\r\npublic relative to his previous career, that Asia, which he received as\r\nthe boundary of the empire, he left its centre.[1105] If any one should\r\nwish, on the other hand, in a similar manner, to pass in review the\r\nexploits of Cæsar, who has shown himself greater still than Pompeius,\r\nwhy then he must enumerate all the countries in the world, a task, I\r\nmay say, without an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (27.)—UNION IN THE SAME PERSON OF THREE OF THE HIGHEST\r\nQUALITIES WITH THE GREATEST PURITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany other men have excelled in different kinds of virtues. Cato,\r\nhowever, who was the first of the Porcian family,[1106] is generally\r\nthought to have been an example of the three greatest of human\r\nendowments, for he was the most talented orator, the most talented\r\ngeneral, and the most talented politician;[1107] all which merits,\r\nif they were not perceptible before him, still shone forth, more\r\nrefulgently even, in my opinion, in Scipio Æmilianus, who besides was\r\nexempted from that hatred on the part of many others under which Cato\r\nlaboured:[1108] in consequence of which it was, what must be owned to\r\nbe a peculiarity in Cato’s career, that he had to plead his own cause\r\nno less than four and forty times;[1109] and yet, though no person was\r\nso frequently accused, he was always acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (28.)—INSTANCES OF EXTREME COURAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA minute enquiry by whom the greatest valour has ever been exhibited,\r\nwould lead to an endless discussion, more especially if all the fables\r\nof the poets are to be taken for granted. Q. Ennius admired T. Cæcilius\r\nDenter[1110] and his brother to such a degree, that on their account\r\nhe added a sixteenth book to his Annals. L. Siccius Dentatus, who was\r\ntribune of the people in the consulship of Spurius Tarpeius and A.\r\nAterius,[1111] not long after the expulsion of the kings, has also very\r\nnumerous testimonies in his favour. This hero fought one hundred and\r\ntwenty battles, was eight times victorious in single combat, and was\r\ngraced with forty-five wounds in the front of the body, without one on\r\nthe back. The same man also carried off thirty-four spoils,[1112] was\r\neighteen times presented with the victor’s spear,[1113] and received\r\ntwenty-five pendants,[1114] eighty-three torcs,[1115] one hundred\r\nand sixty bracelets,[1116] twenty-six crowns, (of which fourteen were\r\ncivic, eight golden, three mural, and one obsidional), a fisc[1117] of\r\nmoney, ten prisoners, and twenty oxen altogether.[1118] He followed\r\nin the triumphal processions of nine generals, who mainly owed their\r\nvictories to his exertions; besides all which, a thing that I look upon\r\nas the most important of all his services, he denounced to the people\r\nT. Romilius,[1119] one of the generals of the army, at the end of his\r\nconsulship, and had him convicted of having made an improper use of his\r\nauthority.[1120]\r\n\r\nThe military honours of Manlius Capitolinus would have been no less\r\nsplendid than his, if they had not been all effaced at the close of\r\nhis life. Before his seventeenth year, he had gained two spoils, and\r\nwas the first of equestrian rank who received a mural crown; he also\r\ngained six civic crowns, thirty-seven donations, and had twenty-three\r\nscars on the fore-part of his body. He saved the life of P. Servilius,\r\nthe master of the horse, receiving wounds on the same occasion in\r\nthe shoulders and the thigh. Besides all this, unaided, he saved the\r\nCapitol, when it was attacked by the Gauls, and through that, the state\r\nitself; a thing that would have been the most glorious act of all, if\r\nhe had not so saved it, in order that he might, as its king, become its\r\nmaster.[1121] But in all matters of this nature, although valour may\r\neffect much, fortune does still more.\r\n\r\nNo person living, in my opinion at least, ever excelled M.\r\nSergius,[1122] although his great-grandson, Catiline, tarnished the\r\nhonours of his name. In his second campaign he lost his right hand;\r\nand in two campaigns he was wounded three and twenty times; so much\r\nso, that he could scarcely use either his hands or his feet; still,\r\nattended by a single slave, he afterwards served in many campaigns,\r\nthough but an invalided soldier. He was twice taken prisoner by\r\nHannibal, (for it was with no ordinary enemy that he would engage,) and\r\ntwice did he escape from his captivity, after having been kept, without\r\na single day’s intermission, in chains and fetters for twenty months.\r\nOn four occasions he fought with his left hand alone, two horses being\r\nslain under him. He had a right hand made of iron, and attached to\r\nthe stump, after which he fought a battle, and raised the siege of\r\nCremona, defended Placentia, and took twelve of the enemy’s camps in\r\nGaul. All this we learn from an oration of his, which he delivered\r\nwhen, in his prætorship, his colleagues attempted to exclude him from\r\nthe sacred rites, on the ground of his infirmities.[1123] What heaps\r\nupon heaps of crowns would he have piled up, if he had only had other\r\nenemies! For, in matters of this nature, it is of the first importance\r\nto consider upon what times in especial the valour of each man has\r\nfallen. What civic crowns did Trebia, what did the Ticinus, what did\r\nLake Thrasymenus afford? What crown was there to be gained at Cannæ,\r\nwhere it was deemed the greatest effort of valour to have escaped[1124]\r\nfrom the enemy? Other persons have been conquerors of men, no doubt,\r\nbut Sergius[1125] conquered even Fortune herself.[1126]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (29.)—MEN OF REMARKABLE GENIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong so many different pursuits, and so great a variety of works and\r\nobjects, who can select the palm of glory for transcendent genius?\r\nUnless perchance we should agree in opinion that no more brilliant\r\ngenius ever existed than the Greek poet Homer, whether it is that\r\nwe regard the happy subject of his work, or the excellence of its\r\nexecution. For this reason it was that Alexander the Great—and it is\r\nonly by judges of such high estate that a sentence, just and unbiassed\r\nby envy, can be pronounced in the case of such lofty claims—when he\r\nfound among the spoils of Darius, the king of Persia, a casket for\r\nperfumes,[1127] enriched with gold, precious stones, and pearls,\r\ncovered as he was with the dust of battle, deemed it beneath a warrior\r\nto make use of unguents, and, when his friends were pointing out to\r\nhim its various uses, exclaimed, “Nay, but by Hercules! let the casket\r\nbe used for preserving the poems of Homer;” that so the most precious\r\nwork of the human mind might be placed in the keeping of the richest\r\nwork of art. It was the same conqueror, too, who gave directions that\r\nthe descendants and house of the poet Pindar[1128] should be spared,\r\nat the taking of Thebes. He likewise rebuilt the native city[1129] of\r\nAristotle, uniting to the extraordinary brilliancy of his exploits this\r\nspeaking testimony of his kindliness of disposition.\r\n\r\nApollo impeached by name the assassins of the poet Archilochus[1130]\r\nat Delphi. While the Lacedæmonians were besieging Athens, Father Liber\r\nordered the funeral rites to be performed for Sophocles, the very\r\nprince of the tragic buskin; repeatedly warning their king, Lysander,\r\nin his sleep, to allow of the burial of his favourite. Upon this, the\r\nking made enquiry who had lately died in Athens; and understanding\r\nwithout any difficulty from the Athenians to whom the god referred, he\r\nallowed the funeral rites to be performed without molestation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31. (30.)—MEN WHO HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE FOR WISDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDionysius the tyrant, who otherwise manifested a natural propensity for\r\ncruelty and pride, sent a vessel crowned with garlands to meet Plato,\r\nthat high-priest of wisdom; and on his disembarcation, received him on\r\nthe shore, in a chariot drawn by four white horses. Isocrates was able\r\nto sell a single oration of his for twenty talents.[1131] Æschines, the\r\ngreat Athenian orator, after he had read to the Rhodians the speech\r\nwhich he had made on the accusation of Demosthenes, read the defence\r\nmade by Demosthenes, through which he had been driven into exile among\r\nthem. When they expressed their admiration of it, “How much more,”\r\nsaid he, “would you have admired it, if you had heard him deliver it\r\nhimself;”[1132] a striking testimony, indeed, given in adversity, to\r\nthe merit of an enemy! The Athenians sent their general, Thucydides,\r\ninto banishment, but recalled him as their historian, admiring his\r\neloquence, though they had punished his want of valour.[1133] A strong\r\ntestimony, too, was given to the merit of Menander, the famous comic\r\npoet, by the kings of Egypt and Macedonia, in sending to him a fleet\r\nand an embassy; though, what was still more honourable to him, he\r\npreferred enjoying the converse of his literary pursuits to the favour\r\nof kings.\r\n\r\nThe nobles too of Rome have given their testimonies in favour of\r\nforeigners, even. Cn. Pompeius, after having finished the war against\r\nMithridates, when he went to call at the house of Posidonius, the\r\nfamous teacher of philosophy, forbade the lictor to knock at the door,\r\nas was the usual custom;[1134] and he, to whom both the eastern and the\r\nwestern world had yielded submission, ordered the fasces to be lowered\r\nbefore the door of a learned man. Cato the Censor, after he had heard\r\nthe speech of Carneades,[1135] who was one of the embassy sent from\r\nAthens, of three men famous for their learning, gave it as his opinion,\r\nthat the ambassadors ought to be dismissed as soon as possible,\r\nbecause, in consequence of his ingenious method of arguing, it became\r\nextremely difficult to distinguish truth from falsehood.[1136] What an\r\nextraordinary change too in our modes of thinking! This Cato constantly\r\ngave it out as his decided opinion that all Greeks ought to be expelled\r\nfrom Italy, while, on the other hand, his great-grandson, Cato of\r\nUtica, upon his return from his military tribuneship, brought back\r\nwith him a philosopher, and a second one[1137] when he returned from\r\nhis embassy to Cyprus;[1138] and it is a very remarkable fact, that\r\nthe same language which had been proscribed by one of the Cato’s, was\r\nintroduced among us by the other. But let us now give some account of\r\nthe honours of our own countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe elder Africanus ordered that the statue of Ennius should be placed\r\nin his tomb, and that the illustrious surname, which he had acquired,\r\nI may say, as his share of the spoil on the conquest of the third part\r\nof the world, should be read over his ashes, along with the name of\r\nthe poet.[1139] The Emperor Augustus, now deified, forbade the works\r\nof Virgil to be burnt, in opposition to the modest directions to that\r\neffect, which the poet had left in his will: a prohibition which\r\nwas a greater compliment paid to his merit, than if he himself had\r\nrecommended his works.\r\n\r\nM. Varro[1140] is the only person, who, during his lifetime, saw his\r\nown statue erected. This was placed in the first public library that\r\nwas ever built, and which was formed by Asinius Pollio with the spoils\r\nof our enemies.[1141] The fact of this distinction being conferred\r\nupon him by one who was in the first rank, both as an orator and a\r\ncitizen, and at a time, too, when there was so great a number of men\r\ndistinguished for their genius, was not less honourable to him, in\r\nmy opinion, than the naval crown which Pompeius Magnus bestowed upon\r\nhim in the war against the pirates. The instances that follow among\r\nthe Romans, if I were to attempt to reckon them, would be found to be\r\ninnumerable; for it is the fact that this one nation has furnished\r\na greater number of distinguished men in every branch than all the\r\ncountries of the world taken together.[1142]\r\n\r\nPut what atonement could I offer to thee, Marcus Tullius,[1143] were I\r\nto be silent respecting thy name? or on what ground am I to pronounce\r\nthee as especially pre-eminent? On what, indeed, that can be more\r\nconvincing than the most abundant testimony that was offered in thy\r\nfavour by the whole Roman people? Contenting myself with the selection\r\nonly of such of the great actions of the whole of your life, as were\r\nperformed during your consulship.—You speak, and the tribes surrender\r\nthe Agrarian law, or, in other words, their very subsistence;[1144] you\r\nadvise them to do so, and they pardon Roscius,[1145] the author of the\r\nlaw for the regulation of the theatres, and, without any feelings of\r\nresentment, allow a mark to be put upon themselves by allotting them\r\nan inferior seat; you entreat, and the sons of proscribed men blush\r\nat having canvassed for public honours: before your genius, Catiline\r\ntook to flight, and it was you who proscribed M. Antonius. Hail then\r\nto thee, who wast the first of all to receive the title of Father of\r\nthy country,[1146] who wast the first of all, while wearing the toga,\r\nto merit a triumph, and who didst obtain the laurel for oratory. Great\r\nfather, thou, of eloquence and of Latin literature! as the Dictator\r\nCæsar, once thy enemy, wrote in testimony of thee,[1147] thou didst\r\nrequire a laurel superior to every triumph! How far greater and more\r\nglorious to have enlarged so immeasurably the boundaries of the Roman\r\ngenius, than those of its sway!\r\n\r\n(31.) Those persons among the Romans, who surpass all others in wisdom,\r\nhave the surnames of Catus and Corculus[1148] given to them. Among the\r\nGreeks, Socrates was declared by the oracle of the Pythian Apollo to be\r\nsuperior to all others in wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (32.)—PRECEPTS THE MOST USEFUL IN LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, men have placed on an equality with those of the oracles the\r\nprecepts uttered by Chilon,[1149] the Lacedæmonian. These have been\r\nconsecrated at Delphi in letters of gold, and are to the following\r\neffect: “That each person ought to know himself, and not to desire to\r\npossess too much;”[1150] and “That misery is the sure companion of debt\r\nand litigation.” He died of joy, on hearing that his son had been\r\nvictorious in the Olympic games, and all Greece assisted at his funeral\r\nrites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (33.)—DIVINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA spirit of divination, and a certain communion with the gods, of the\r\nmost exalted nature, was manifested—among women, in the Sibyl, and\r\namong men, in Melampodes,[1151] the Greek, and in Marcius,[1152] the\r\nRoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (34.)—THE MAN WHO WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE THE MOST EXCELLENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nScipio Nasica is the only individual who, since the commencement of the\r\nRoman era, has been declared, by a vote of the senate, confirmed by\r\noath, to be the most excellent of men.[1153] And yet, the same person,\r\nwhen he was a candidate for office, was twice stigmatized by a repulse\r\nof the Roman people. He was not allowed, in fine, to die in his native\r\ncountry,[1154]—no, by Hercules! no more than Socrates, who was declared\r\nby Apollo to be the wisest of men, was permitted to die outside of a\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (35.)—THE MOST CHASTE MATRONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSulpicia, the daughter of Paterculus, and wife of Fulvius Flaccus, has\r\nbeen considered, in the judgment of matrons, to have been the chastest\r\nof women. She was selected from one hundred Roman ladies, who had\r\nbeen previously named, to dedicate a statue of Venus, in obedience to\r\nthe precepts contained in the Sibylline books.[1155] Again, Claudia\r\ngave strong proof of her piety and virtue, on the occasion of the\r\nintroduction into Rome of the Mother of the gods.[1156]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (36.)—INSTANCES OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF AFFECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfinite is the number of examples of affection which have been known\r\nin all parts of the world: but one in particular occurred at Rome, to\r\nwhich no other can possibly be compared. A woman of quite the lower\r\nclass, and whose name has consequently not come down to us, having\r\nlately given birth to a child, obtained permission to visit her\r\nmother,[1157] who was confined in prison; but was always carefully\r\nsearched by the gaoler before being admitted, to prevent her from\r\nintroducing any food. At last, however, she was detected nourishing\r\nher mother with the milk of her breast; upon which, in consideration\r\nof the marvellous affection of the daughter, the mother was pardoned,\r\nand they were both maintained for the rest of their days at the public\r\ncharge; the spot, too, was consecrated to Piety, a temple to that\r\ngoddess being built on the site of the prison, in the consulship[1158]\r\nof C. Quintius and M. Acilius, where the theatre of Marcellus[1159] now\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nThe father of the Gracchi, on finding [two] serpents in his house,\r\nconsulted the soothsayers, and received an answer to the effect,\r\nthat he would survive if the serpent of the other sex was put to\r\ndeath.—“No,” said he, “rather kill the serpent of my own sex, for\r\nCornelia is still young, and may yet bear children.”[1160] Thus did\r\nhe shew himself ready, at the same moment, to spare his wife and to\r\nbenefit the state; and shortly after, his wish was accomplished.\r\nM. Lepidus died of regret for his wife, Apuleia, after having been\r\ndivorced from her.[1161] P. Rupilius,[1162] who was at the time\r\naffected by a slight disease, instantly expired, upon news being\r\nbrought to him that his brother had failed in obtaining the consulship.\r\nP. Catienus Plotinus was so much attached to his patron, that on\r\nfinding himself named heir to all his property, he threw himself on the\r\nfuneral pile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (37.)—NAMES OF MEN WHO HAVE EXCELLED IN THE ARTS, ASTROLOGY,\r\nGRAMMAR, AND MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the men who have excelled in the various arts; we\r\nmay, however, take a cursory survey of them, by citing the names of\r\nthe principal ones. Berosus excelled in astrology; and on account of\r\nhis divinations and predictions, a public statue was erected in his\r\nhonour by the Athenians. Apollodorus, for his skill as a grammarian,\r\nhad public honours decreed him by the Amphictyonic Council of Greece.\r\nHippocrates excelled in medicine; before its arrival, he predicted\r\nthe plague, which afterwards came from Illyria, and sent his pupils\r\nto various cities, to give their assistance. As an acknowledgment of\r\nhis merit, Greece decreed him the same honours as to Hercules.[1163]\r\nKing Ptolemy rewarded a similar degree of skill in the person of\r\nCleombrotus of Ceos, by a donation of one hundred talents, at the\r\nMegalensian games,[1164] he having succeeded in saving the life of King\r\nAntiochus.[1165] Critobulus also rendered himself extremely famous, by\r\nextracting an arrow[1166] from the eye of King Philip with so much\r\nskill, that, although the sight was lost, there was no defect to be\r\nseen.[1167] Asclepiades of Prusa, however, acquired the greatest fame\r\nof all—he founded a new sect, treated with disdain the promises of\r\nKing Mithridates conveyed to him by an embassy, discovered a method\r\nof successfully treating diseases by wine,[1168] and, breaking in\r\nupon the funeral ceremony, saved the life of a man, who was actually\r\nplaced[1169] on the funeral pile. He rendered himself, however, more\r\ncelebrated than all, by staking his reputation as a physician against\r\nFortune herself, and asserting that he did not wish to be so much as\r\nlooked upon as a physician, if he should ever happen in any way to fall\r\nsick; and he won his wager, for he met his death at an extreme old age,\r\nby falling down stairs.[1170]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—GEOMETRY AND ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Marcellus, too, at the taking of Syracuse, offered a remarkable\r\nhomage to the sciences of geometry and mechanics, by giving orders that\r\nArchimedes was to be the only person who should not be molested; his\r\ncommands, however, were disregarded, in consequence of the imprudence\r\nof one of the soldiers.[1171] Chersiphron, also, the Cnossian,[1172]\r\nwas rendered famous by the admirable construction of the temple\r\nof Diana at Ephesus; Philon, by the construction of the basin at\r\nAthens, which was capable of containing one thousand vessels;[1173]\r\nCtesibius, by the invention of pneumatics and hydraulic machines; and\r\nDinochares,[1174] by the plan which he made of the city of Alexandria,\r\nfounded by Alexander in Egypt. The same monarch, too, by public edict,\r\ndeclared that no one should paint his portrait except Apelles, and\r\nthat no one should make a marble statue of him except Pyrgoteles, or\r\na bronze one except Lysippus.[1175] These arts have all been rendered\r\nglorious by many illustrious examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (38.)—OF PAINTING; ENGRAVING ON BRONZE, MARBLE, AND IVORY; OF\r\nCARVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Attalus gave one hundred talents,[1176] at a public auction, for\r\na single picture of Aristides, the Theban painter.[1177] Cæsar, the\r\nDictator, purchased two pictures, the Medea and the Ajax of Timomachus,\r\nfor eighty talents,[1178] it being his intention to dedicate them\r\nin the temple of Venus Genetrix. King Candaules gave its weight in\r\ngold for a large picture by Bularchus, the subject of which was the\r\ndestruction of the Magnetes. Demetrius, who was surnamed the “taker\r\nof cities,”[1179] refused to set fire to the city of Rhodes, lest he\r\nshould chance to destroy a picture of Protogenes, which was placed\r\non that side of the walls against which his attack was directed.\r\nPraxiteles[1180] has been ennobled by his works in marble, and more\r\nespecially by his Cnidian Venus, which became remarkable from the\r\ninsane love which it inspired in a certain young man,[1181] and the\r\nhigh value set upon it by King Nicomedes, who endeavoured to procure it\r\nfrom the Cnidians, by offering to pay for them a large debt which they\r\nowed. The Olympian Jupiter day by day bears testimony to the talents of\r\nPhidias,[1182] and the Capitoline Jupiter and the Diana of Ephesus to\r\nthose of Mentor;[1183] to which deities, also, were consecrated vases\r\nmade by this artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40. (39.)—SLAVES FOR WHICH A HIGH PRICE HAS BEEN GIVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest price ever given for a man born in slavery, so far as I\r\nam able to discover, was that paid for Daphnus, the grammarian, who\r\nwas sold by Natius of Pisaurum[1184] to M. Scaurus, the first man in\r\nthe state, for seven hundred thousand sesterces.[1185] In our day, no\r\ndoubt, comic actors have fetched a higher price, but then they were\r\npurchasing their own freedom. In the time of our ancestors, Roscius,\r\nthe actor, gained five hundred thousand sesterces annually. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, a person might in the present instance refer to the case of the\r\narmy commissary[1186] in the Armenian war, which was of late years\r\nundertaken in favour of Tiridates; which officer, in our own time,\r\nreceived his manumission from Nero for the sum of thirteen million\r\nsesterces;[1187] but, in this case, the consideration was the profit to\r\nbe derived from the war,[1188] and it was not the value of the man that\r\nwas paid for. And so, too, when Lutorius Priscus bought of Sejanus,\r\nthe eunuch, Pæzon, for fifty million sesterces,[1189] the price was\r\ngiven, by Hercules! rather to gratify the passion of the purchaser,\r\nthan in commendation of the beauty of the slave. Universal sorrow and\r\nconsternation then reigning, the public were too much pre-occupied with\r\nit to put a stop to a bargain of so scandalous a nature.[1190]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (40.)—SUPREME HAPPINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all nations of the earth, the Romans have, without doubt, excelled\r\nevery other in the display of valour.[1191] The human judgment cannot,\r\nhowever, possibly decide what man has enjoyed the highest degree of\r\nhappiness, seeing that every one defines a state of prosperity in a\r\nway different from another, and entirely in conformity with his own\r\nnotions. If we wish to form a true judgment and come to a decision,\r\ncasting aside all the allurements and illusions of fortune, we are\r\nbound to say that no mortal is happy. Fortune has dealt well, and,\r\nindeed, indulgently, to him who feels that he has a right to say that\r\nhe is not unhappy. For if there is nothing else, at all events, there\r\nis the fear lest fortune should fail at last; which fear itself, when\r\nit has once fastened upon us, our happiness is no longer unalloyed.\r\nAnd then, too, is it not the case that there is no mortal who is\r\nalways wise? Would that there were many to be found, who could feel a\r\nconviction that this is false, and that it had not been enunciated by\r\nan oracle itself, as it were! Mortals, vain as they are, and ingenious\r\nin deceiving themselves, calculate in the same way as the Thracians,\r\nwho, according to their experience of each day, deposit in an urn a\r\nblack or a white pebble; at the close of their life, these pebbles are\r\nseparated, and from the relative number of each kind, they form their\r\nconclusions.[1192] But really, may not that very day that has been\r\ncomplimented with a white pebble, have contained in itself the germ of\r\nsome misfortune? How many a man has got into trouble by the very power\r\nwhich has been bestowed upon him? How many have been brought to ruin\r\nand plunged into the deepest misery by their own blessings? or rather,\r\nby what have been looked upon too fondly as blessings, for the hour\r\nduring which they were in the full enjoyment of them. But most true\r\nit is, that it is the day after, that is the judge of the day before;\r\nand after all, it is only the last day that is to set its stamp on the\r\nwhole; the consequence is, that we can put our trust in none of them.\r\nAnd then, too, is it not the fact that the blessings of life would\r\nnot be equal to its evils, even though they were equal in number? For\r\nwhat pleasure is there that can compensate for the slightest grief?\r\nAlas! what a vain and unreasonable task we impose upon ourselves! We\r\ntrouble ourselves with counting the _number_ of days, when it is their\r\n_weight_[1193] that ought to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42. (41.)—RARE INSTANCES OF GOOD FORTUNE CONTINUING IN THE SAME\r\nFAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole course of ages, we find only one woman, and that,\r\nLampido, the Lacedæmonian, who was the daughter of a king, the wife of\r\na king, and the mother of a king.[1194] Berenice was the only woman\r\nwho was daughter, sister, and mother of conquerors in the Olympian\r\ngames.[1195] The family of the Curios[1196] has been the only one to\r\nproduce three orators in succession; that of the Fabii alone has given\r\nthree chiefs of the senate in succession, Fabius Ambustus, his son\r\nFabius Rullianus, and his grandson Quintus Fabius Gurges.[1197]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43. (42.)—REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF VICISSITUDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to examples of the vicissitudes of Fortune, they are innumerable.\r\nFor what great pleasures has she ever given us, which have not taken\r\ntheir rise in misfortunes? And what extraordinary misfortunes have not\r\ntaken their first rise in great pleasures? (43.) It was fortune that\r\npreserved the Senator, M. Fidustius,[1198] who had been proscribed by\r\nSylla, for a period of thirty-six years. And yet he was proscribed a\r\nsecond time; for he survived Sylla, even to the days of Antony, and, as\r\nit appears, was proscribed by him, for no other reason but because he\r\nhad been proscribed before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—REMARKABLE EXAMPLES OF HONOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune has determined that P. Ventidius alone should enjoy the honour\r\nof a triumph over the Parthians, and yet the same individual, when he\r\nwas a child, she led in the triumphal procession of Cneius Pompeius,\r\nthe conqueror of Asculum.[1199] Indeed, Masurius says, that he had been\r\ntwice led in triumph; and according to Cicero, he used to let out mules\r\nfor the bakers of the camp.[1200] Most writers, indeed, admit that his\r\nyounger days were passed in the greatest poverty, and that he wore the\r\nhob-nailed shoes[1201] of the common soldier. Balbus Cornelius, also,\r\nthe elder, was elected to the consulate;[1202] but he had previously\r\nbeen accused, and the judges had been charged to discuss the point\r\nwhether he could or not lawfully be scourged with rods; he being the\r\nfirst foreigner,[1203]—born even on the very shores of the ocean,—who\r\nobtained that honour, which our ancestors denied even to the people\r\nof Latium.[1204] Among other remarkable instances, also, we have that\r\nof L. Fulvius,[1205] the consul of the rebellious Tusculani, who,\r\nimmediately upon his coming over to the Romans, obtained from them the\r\nsame honour. He is the only individual who, in the same year in which\r\nhe had been its enemy, enjoyed the honour of a triumph in Rome, and\r\nthat too, over the people whose consul he had previously been.\r\n\r\nDown to the present time, L. Sylla is the only man who has claimed\r\nto himself the surname of “Happy;”[1206] a name which he derived,\r\nforsooth, from the bloodshed of the citizens and the oppression of his\r\ncountry! But what claim had he on which to found his title to this\r\nhappiness? Was it the power which he had of proscribing and massacreing\r\nso many thousands of his fellow-citizens? Oh interpretation most\r\ndisgraceful, and which must stamp him as “Unhappy”[1207] to all future\r\ntime! Were not the men who perished in those times, of the two, to be\r\nlooked upon as the more fortunate—seeing that with them we sympathize,\r\nwhile there is no one who does not detest Sylla? And then, besides,\r\nwas not the close of his life more horrible than the sufferings which\r\nhad been experienced by any of those who had been proscribed by\r\nhim? his very flesh eating into itself, and so engendering his own\r\npunishment.[1208] And this, although he may have thought proper to\r\ngloss it over by that last dream of his,[1209] in the very midst of\r\nwhich he may be said, in some measure, to have died; and in which,\r\nas he pretended, he was told that his glory alone had risen superior\r\nto all envy; though at the same time, he confessed that it was still\r\nwanting to his supreme happiness, that he had not dedicated the\r\nCapitol.[1210]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—TEN VERY FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE HAPPENED TO THE\r\nSAME PERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Metellus, in the funeral oration which he made in praise of his\r\nfather, L. Metellus, who had been pontiff, twice consul,[1211]\r\ndictator, master of the horse, one of the quindecemvirs for dividing\r\nthe lands,[1212] and the first who had elephants in his triumphal\r\nprocession,[1213] the same having been taken in the first Punic war,\r\nhas left it written to the effect that his father had attained the ten\r\ngreatest and best things, in the search after which wise men have spent\r\nall their lives. For, as he states, he was anxious to become the first\r\nwarrior, the best orator, the bravest general, that the most important\r\nof all business should be entrusted to his charge, that he should\r\nenjoy the very highest honours, that he should possess consummate\r\nwisdom, that he should be regarded as the most distinguished senator,\r\nthat he should by honourable means acquire a large fortune, that he\r\nshould leave behind him many children, and that he should be the most\r\nillustrious person in the state. To refute this assertion, would be\r\ntedious and indeed unnecessary, seeing that it is contradicted more\r\nthan sufficiently by the single fact, that Metellus passed his old age,\r\ndeprived of his sight, which he had lost in a fire, while rescuing the\r\nPalladium from the temple of Vesta;[1214] a glorious action, no doubt,\r\nalthough the result was unhappy: on which account it is, that although\r\nhe ought not to be called unfortunate, still he cannot be called\r\nfortunate. The Roman people, however, granted him a privilege which no\r\none else had ever obtained since the foundation of the city, that of\r\nbeing conveyed to the senate-house in a chariot whenever he went to the\r\nsenate:[1215] a great distinction, no doubt, but bought at the price of\r\nhis sight.\r\n\r\n(44.) The son also, of the same Q. Metellus, who has given the above\r\naccount of his father, is considered himself to have been one of the\r\nrarest instances of human felicity.[1216] For, in addition to the\r\nvery considerable honours which he obtained, and the surname which he\r\nacquired from the conquest of Macedonia, he was carried to the funeral\r\npile by his four sons,[1217] one of whom had been prætor, three of\r\nthem consuls, two had obtained triumphs, and one had been censor; each\r\nof which honours falls to the lot of a very few only. And yet, in the\r\nvery full-blown pride of his dignity, as he was returning from the\r\nCampus Martius at mid-day, when the Forum and the Capitol are deserted,\r\nhe was seized by the tribune, Caius Atinius Labeo,[1218] surnamed\r\nMacerion, whom, during his censorship, he had ejected from the senate,\r\nand was dragged by him to the Tarpeian rock, for the purpose of being\r\nprecipitated therefrom. The numerous band, however, who called him\r\nby the name of father, flew to his assistance, though tardily, and\r\nonly just, as it were, at the very last moment, to attend his funeral\r\nobsequies, seeing that he could not lawfully offer resistance, or\r\nrepel force by force in the sacred case of a tribune;[1219] and he was\r\njust on the very point of perishing, the victim of his virtues and the\r\nstrictness of his censorship, when he was saved by the intervention of\r\nanother tribune,—only obtained with the greatest difficulty,—and so\r\nrescued from the very jaws of death. He afterwards had to subsist on\r\nthe bounty of others, his property having been consecrated[1220] by the\r\nvery man whom he had degraded; and who, as if that had not satiated\r\nhis vengeance, still farther wreaked his malice upon him, by throwing a\r\nrope around his neck,[1221] and twisting it with such extreme violence\r\nthat the blood flowed from out of his ears.[1222] And for my part, too,\r\nI should look upon it as in the number of his misfortunes, to have\r\nbeen the enemy of the second Africanus; indeed, Macedonicus, in this\r\ninstance, bears testimony against himself; for he said to his sons,\r\n“Go, my children, render the last duties to Scipio; you will never\r\nwitness the funeral of a greater citizen than him;” and this speech\r\nhe made to his sons, one of whom had already acquired the surname of\r\nBalearicus, and another of Diadematus,[1223] he himself at the time\r\nbearing that of Macedonicus.\r\n\r\nNow, if we take into account the above injury alone, can any one justly\r\npronounce that man happy, whose life was thus endangered by the caprice\r\nof an enemy, and that enemy, besides, not an Africanus? What victories\r\nover enemies could possibly be counterbalanced by such a price as this?\r\nWhat honours, what triumphs, did not Fortune cancel, in suffering a\r\ncensor to be dragged through the middle of the city—indeed, that was\r\nhis only resource for gaining time[1224]—dragged to that Capitol,\r\nwhither he himself, in his triumph, had forborne to drag in a similar\r\nmanner even the very captives whom he had taken in his conquests? This\r\ncrime, too, must be looked upon as all the greater, from its having so\r\nnearly deprived Macedonicus of the honours of his funeral, so great\r\nand so glorious, in which he was borne to the pile by his triumphant\r\nchildren, he himself thus triumphing, as it were, in his very\r\nobsequies. Most assuredly, there is no happiness that can be called\r\nunalloyed, when the terror of our life has been interrupted by any\r\noutrage, and much more by such an outrage as this. As for the rest, I\r\nreally am at a loss whether we ought most to commend the manners of the\r\nage,[1225] or to feel an increased degree of indignation, that, among\r\nso many members of the family of the Metelli, such wicked audacity as\r\nthat of C. Atinius remained unpunished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—THE MISFORTUNES OF AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the life of the now deified emperor Augustus even, whom the whole\r\nworld would certainly agree to place in this class,[1226] if we\r\ncarefully examine it in all its features, we shall find remarkable\r\nvicissitudes of human fate. There was his rejection from the post\r\nof master of the horse, by his uncle,[1227] and the preference\r\nwhich was given to Lepidus, and that, too, in opposition to his own\r\nrequests; the hatred produced by the proscription; his alliance in\r\nthe Triumvirate[1228] with some among the very worst of the citizens,\r\nand that, too, with an unequal share of influence, he himself being\r\nentirely borne down by the power of Antony; his illness[1229] at the\r\nbattle of Philippi; his flight, and his having to remain three days\r\nconcealed in a marsh,[1230] though suffering from sickness, and,\r\naccording to the account of Agrippa and Mecænas, labouring under a\r\ndropsy; his shipwreck[1231] on the coast of Sicily, where he was again\r\nunder the necessity of concealing himself in a cave; his desperation,\r\nwhich caused him even to beg Proculeius[1232] to put him to death,\r\nwhen he was hard-pressed by the enemy in a naval engagement;[1233] his\r\nalarm about the rising at Perusia;[1234] his anxiety at the battle\r\nof Actium;[1235] the extreme danger he was in from the falling of a\r\ntower during the Pannonian war;[1236] seditions so numerous among his\r\nsoldiers; so many attacks by dangerous diseases;[1237] the suspicions\r\nwhich he entertained respecting the intentions of Marcellus;[1238]\r\nthe disgraceful banishment, as it were, of Agrippa;[1239] the many\r\nplots against his life;[1240] the deaths of his own children,[1241]\r\nof which he was accused, and his heavy sorrows, caused not merely by\r\ntheir loss;[1242] the adultery[1243] of his daughter, and the discovery\r\nof her parricidal designs; the insulting retreat of his son-in-law,\r\nNero;[1244] another adultery, that of his grand-daughter;[1245] to\r\nwhich there were added numerous other evils, such as the want of\r\nmoney to pay his soldiers; the revolt of Illyria;[1246] the necessity\r\nof levying the slaves; the sad deficiency of young men;[1247] the\r\npestilence that raged in the City;[1248] the famine in Italy; the\r\ndesign which he had formed of putting an end to his life, and the fast\r\nof four days, which brought him within a hair’s breadth of death.\r\nAnd then, added to all this, the slaughter of Varus;[1249] the base\r\nslanders[1250] whispered against his authority; the rejection of\r\nPosthumius Agrippa, after his adoption,[1251] and the regret to which\r\nAugustus was a prey after his banishment;[1252] the suspicions too\r\nrespecting Fabius, to the effect that he had betrayed his secrets;\r\nand then, last of all, the machinations of his wife and of Tiberius,\r\nthe thoughts of which occupied his last moments. In fine, this same\r\ngod,[1253] who was raised to heaven, I am at a loss to say whether\r\ndeservedly or not, died, leaving the son of his own enemy his\r\nheir.[1254]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47. (46.)—MEN WHOM THE GODS HAVE PRONOUNCED TO BE THE MOST HAPPY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reference to this point, two oracles of Delphi may come under our\r\nconsideration, which would appear to have been pronounced as though in\r\norder to chastise the vanity of man. These oracles were the following:\r\nby the first, Pedius was pronounced to be the most happy of men, who\r\nhad just before fallen in defence of his country.[1255] On the second\r\noccasion, when it had been consulted by Gyges, at that time the most\r\npowerful king in the world, it declared that Aglaüs of Psophis[1256]\r\nwas a more happy man than himself.[1257] This Aglaüs was an old man,\r\nwho lived in a poor petty nook of Arcadia, and cultivated a small farm,\r\nthough quite sufficient for the supply of his yearly wants;[1258]\r\nhe had never so much as left it, and, as was quite evident from his\r\nmode of living, his desires being of the most limited kind, he had\r\nexperienced but an extremely small share of the miseries of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48. (47.)—THE MAN WHOM THE GODS ORDERED TO BE WORSHIPPED DURING\r\nHIS LIFE-TIME; A REMARKABLE FLASH OF LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile still surviving, and in full possession of his senses, by the\r\ncommand of the same oracle, and with the sanction of Jupiter, the\r\nsupreme Father of the gods, Euthymus,[1259] the pugilist, who had\r\nalways, with one exception, been victorious in the Olympic games,\r\nwas deified. He was a native of Locri, in Italy. I find that\r\nCallimachus,[1260] considering it a more wonderful circumstance than\r\nany he had ever known, that the two statues which had been erected to\r\nhim, one at Locri, and the other at Olympia, were struck by lightning\r\non the same day, ordered sacrifices to be offered up to him, which\r\nwas accordingly done, both during his life-time, and after his death.\r\nNothing, indeed, has appeared to me so remarkable, as this mark of\r\napproval given by the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49. (48.)—THE GREATEST LENGTH OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only the differences of climate, but the multitude of instances\r\nnamed, and the peculiar destiny attached to each of us from the moment\r\nof his birth,[1261] tend to render one very uncertain in forming any\r\ngeneral conclusion respecting the length and duration of human life.\r\nHesiod, who was the first to make mention of this subject, while he\r\nstates many circumstances about the age of man, which appear to me to\r\nbe fabulous, gives to the crow nine times the ordinary duration of\r\nour life, to the stag four times the length of that of the crow, to\r\nthe raven three times the length of that of the stag, besides other\r\nparticulars with reference to the phœnix and the Nymphs of a still more\r\nfabulous nature. The poet Anacreon gives[1262] one hundred and fifty\r\nyears to Arganthonius,[1263] the king of the Tartessii; ten more to\r\nCinaras,[1264] the king of Cyprus, and two hundred to Ægimius.[1265]\r\nTheopompus gives one hundred and fifty-three years to Epimenides of\r\nCnossus; according to Hellenicus, some of the nation of the Epii, in\r\nÆtolia, have completed their two hundredth year; and his account is\r\nconfirmed by Damastes, who relates that Pictoreus, one of this nation,\r\nwho was remarkable for his size and strength, lived even to his three\r\nhundredth year. Ephorus says that some kings of Arcadia have lived\r\nthree hundred years; Alexander Cornelius, that there was one Dandon,\r\nin Illyricum, who lived five hundred years. Xenophon, in his Periplus,\r\ngives to a king of the island of the Lutmii six hundred years, and, as\r\nthough in that instance he had lied too sparingly, to his son eight\r\nhundred.[1266] All these statements, however, have originated in a want\r\nof acquaintance with the accurate measurement of time. For some nations\r\nreckon the summer as one year, and the winter as another; others again,\r\nconsider each of the four seasons a year; the Arcadians, for instance,\r\nwhose years were of three months each. Others, such as the Egyptians,\r\ncalculate by the moon, and hence it is that some individuals among them\r\nare said to have lived as many as one thousand years.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed, however, to what is admitted to be true. It is pretty\r\nnearly certain, that Arganthonius of Gades[1267] reigned eighty years,\r\nand he is supposed to have commenced his reign when he was forty.\r\nMasinissa, beyond a doubt, reigned sixty years,[1268] and Gorgias, the\r\nSicilian, lived one hundred and eight.[1269] Quintus Fabius Maximus\r\nwas an augur for sixty-three years.[1270] M. Perperna, and more\r\nrecently, L. Volusius Saturninus, survived all those whose suffrages\r\neach had solicited on the occasion of his consulship;[1271] Perperna\r\nlived ninety-eight years, and left after him only seven of those whose\r\nnames, when censor, he had enrolled. Connected with this fact, it also\r\nsuggests itself, and deserves to be remarked, that it has happened\r\nonly once, that five successive years have ever passed without the\r\ndeath of a senator taking place; this was the case from the occasion on\r\nwhich the censors Flaccus and Albinus performed the lustration, in the\r\nyear of the City 579, until the time of the succeeding censors.[1272]\r\nM. Valerius Corvinus completed one hundred years, forty-six of which\r\nintervened between his first and sixth consulship.[1273] He occupied\r\nthe curule chair twenty-one times,[1274] a thing that was never the\r\ncase with any one besides. The pontiff Metellus also attained the same\r\nage.[1275]\r\n\r\nAmong women also, Livia, the wife of Rutilius, exceeded her\r\nninety-sixth year; during the reign of Claudius, Statilia, a member\r\nof a noble family, died at the age of ninety-nine; Terentia, the wife\r\nof Cicero, lived one hundred and three years, and Clodia, the wife of\r\nOfilius, one hundred and fifteen; she had fifteen children.[1276]\r\n\r\nLucceia, an actress in the mimes, performed on the stage when one\r\nhundred years old, and Galeria Copiola returned to the stage, to\r\nperform in the interludes,[1277] at the votive games which were\r\ncelebrated for the health of the deified Augustus, in the consulship of\r\nC. Poppæus and Q. Sulpicius.[1278] She had made her first appearance\r\nwhen eight years of age, just ninety-one years before that time, when\r\nM. Pomponius was ædile of the people, in the consulship of C. Marius\r\nand Cn. Carbo.[1279] When Pompeius Magnus dedicated his great theatre,\r\nhe brought her upon the stage, as being quite a wonder, considering\r\nher old age. Asconius Pedianus informs us, that Sammula also lived one\r\nhundred and ten years. I consider it less wonderful that Stephanio,\r\nwho was the first to dance on the stage in comedy descriptive of Roman\r\nmanners, should have[1280] danced at the two secular games, those\r\ncelebrated by the deified Augustus, and by Claudius Cæsar, in his\r\nfourth consulship, considering that the interval that elapsed between\r\nthem was no more than sixty-three years;[1281] indeed, he lived a\r\nconsiderable time after the last period. We are informed by Mutianus,\r\nthat, on the peak of Mount Tmolus, which is called Tempsis, the people\r\nlive one hundred and fifty years, and that T. Fullonius, of Bononia,\r\nwas set down as of the same age, in the registration which took place\r\nunder the censorship of Claudius Cæsar; and this appeared to be\r\nconfirmed by comparing the present with former registrations, as well\r\nas many other proofs that he had been alive at certain periods—for that\r\nprince greatly interested himself in ascertaining the exact truth of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50. (49.)—THE VARIETY OF DESTINIES AT THE BIRTH OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present conjuncture would appear to demand from me some\r\nopinion upon the science of the stars. Epigenes[1282] used to\r\nmaintain that human life could not be possibly prolonged to one\r\nhundred and twelve years, and Berosus[1283] that it could exceed\r\none hundred and seventeen. The system is still in existence which\r\nPetosiris and Necepsos[1284] transmitted to us, and called by them\r\n“tartemorion,”[1285] from the division of the signs into four portions;\r\nfrom which it would appear, that life, in the region of Italy, may\r\npossibly be extended to one hundred and twenty-four years. They\r\nmaintain that, reckoning from the commencement of an ascending sign, no\r\nlife can possibly exceed a period of ninety degrees from that point;\r\nwhich periods they call by the name of “anaphoræ;”[1286] they say also,\r\nthat these anaphoræ may be intercepted by meeting with malign stars or\r\ntheir rays even, or those of the sun.[1287] To theirs the school of\r\nÆsculapius succeeded, which admits that the allotted duration of life\r\nis regulated by the stars, but that it is quite uncertain what is the\r\ngreatest extent of the period. These say that long life is uncommon,\r\nbecause a very great number of persons are born at critical moments\r\nin the hours of the lunar days; for example, in the seventh and the\r\nfifteenth hours, both by day and night; these individuals are subject\r\nto the malign influence of that ascending scale of the years which is\r\ntermed the “climacteric,”[1288] and never hardly, when born under these\r\ncircumstances, exceed the fifty-fourth year. First of all, however,\r\nit must strike us that the variations which have taken place in this\r\nscience prove its uncertainty; and to this consideration may be added\r\nthe experience of the very last census, which was made four years ago,\r\nunder the direction of the Emperors Vespasian, father and son.[1289] I\r\nshall not search through the registers;[1290] I shall only cite some\r\ninstances in the middle district that lies between the Apennines and\r\nthe river Padus. At Parma, three persons declared themselves to be\r\none hundred and twenty years of age; at Brixellum,[1291] one was one\r\nhundred and twenty-five; at Parma, two were one hundred and thirty;\r\nat Placentia, one was one hundred and thirty; at Faventia, one woman\r\nwas one hundred and thirty-two; at Bononia, L. Terentius, the son of\r\nMarcus, and at Ariminum, M. Aponius, were one hundred and forty, and\r\nTertulla, one hundred and thirty-seven. In the hills which lie around\r\nPlacentia is the town of Veleiacium,[1292] in which six persons gave\r\nin their ages as one hundred and ten years, and four one hundred and\r\ntwenty, while one person, M. Mucius, the son of Marcus, surnamed Felix,\r\nand of the Galerian tribe,[1293] was aged one hundred and forty. Not,\r\nhowever, to dwell upon what is generally admitted, in the eighth region\r\nof Italy, there appeared by the register, to be fifty-four persons\r\nof one hundred years of age, fourteen of one hundred and ten, two of\r\none hundred and twenty-five, four of one hundred and thirty, the same\r\nnumber of one hundred and thirty-five to one hundred and thirty-seven,\r\nand three of one hundred and forty.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have another illustration of the uncertain tenure of human\r\nlife. Homer informs us that Hector and Polydamas[1294] were born on\r\nthe same night,[1295] and yet how different was their fate! M. Cælius\r\nRufus[1296] and C. Licinius Calvus were born on the same day, the\r\nfifth before the calends of June, in the consulship of C. Marius and\r\nCn. Carbo; they both of them lived to be orators, it is true, but how\r\ndifferent their destiny! The same thing, too, happens every day, and\r\nin every part of the world, with respect to men that are born in the\r\nself-same hour; masters and slaves, kings and beggars, come into the\r\nworld at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51. (50.)—VARIOUS INSTANCES OF DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. Cornelius Rufus,[1297] who was consul with M. Curio, lost his sight\r\nwhile he was asleep and dreaming that that accident had befallen\r\nhim. On the other hand, Jason, of Pheræ, when he was labouring under\r\nan abscess and had been given up by the physicians, determined to\r\nend his life in battle, where he received a wound in the chest, and\r\nfound, at the hands of the enemy, a remedy for his disease.[1298] Q.\r\nFabius Maximus,[1299] the consul, having engaged in battle with the\r\nAllobroges and the Arverni, at the river Isara, on the sixth day before\r\nthe ides of August, and having slain there one hundred and thirty\r\nthousand of the enemy, found himself cured, during the engagement, of a\r\nquartan fever.\r\n\r\nThis gift of life, which is bestowed upon us by nature, is extremely\r\nuncertain and frail, whatever portion of it may be allotted to us. The\r\nmeasure is, indeed, but scanty and brief, even when it is the largest,\r\nif we only reflect upon the extent of eternity. And then, besides,\r\nif we take into account our sleep during the night, we can only be\r\nproperly said to live half the period of our life; seeing that just one\r\nhalf of it is passed, either in a state resembling death, or else of\r\nbodily suffering, if we are unable to sleep. Added to this, we ought\r\nnot to reckon the years of infancy, during which we are not sensible of\r\nour existence, nor yet the years of old age, which is prolonged only\r\nfor the punishment of those who arrive at it. There are so many kinds\r\nof dangers, so many diseases, so many apprehensions, so many cares, we\r\nso often invoke death, that really there is nothing that is so often\r\nthe object of our wishes. Nature has, in reality, bestowed no greater\r\nblessing on man than the shortness of life. The senses become dull,\r\nthe limbs torpid, the sight, the hearing, the legs, the teeth, and\r\nthe organs of digestion, all of them die before us, and yet we reckon\r\nthis state as a part of our life. The solitary instance of Xenophilus,\r\nthe musician,[1300] who lived one hundred and five years without any\r\ninfirmity of body, must be regarded then as a kind of miracle; for,\r\nby Hercules! all other men are subject, at certain fixed periods,\r\nto recurring and deadly attacks by heat or cold, in every part of\r\nthe body, a thing that is not the case with other animals; and these\r\nattacks, too, return not only at regular hours, but on certain days and\r\ncertain nights—sometimes the third day, sometimes the fourth, sometimes\r\nevery day throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, there is another kind of fatal disease, that which is\r\nproduced by over-exertion of the mental faculties.[1301] Nature has\r\nappointed certain laws as well for our maladies; quartan fevers never\r\ncommence at the winter solstice, nor yet during the winter months;\r\nsome diseases never attack us after the sixtieth year; some again\r\ndisappear at the age of puberty, especially in females;[1302] while\r\naged persons are but seldom affected by the plague. There are some\r\ndiseases which attack whole nations; others prevail among classes; some\r\namong slaves,[1303] others among the higher ranks, and others among\r\nother classes of society. It has been remarked, in reference to this\r\nsubject, that the plague always takes a course from the south towards\r\nthe west,[1304] and scarcely ever in an opposite direction; it never\r\nappears in the winter, or lasts longer than three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52. (51.)—DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now to speak of the premonitory signs of death. Among these are\r\nlaughter, in madness;[1305] in cases of delirium,[1306] the patient\r\ncarefully folding the fringe or the plaits of the bedclothes;[1307]\r\ninsensibility to the attempts of those who would rouse them from sleep;\r\nand involuntary discharges from the body, which it is not necessary\r\nhere to particularize; but the most unequivocal signs of all, are\r\ncertain appearances of the eyes and the nose, a lying posture with\r\nthe face continually upwards, an irregular and feeble motion of the\r\npulse,[1308] and the other symptoms, which have been observed by that\r\nprince of physicians, Hippocrates. At the same time that there are\r\ninnumerable signs of death, there are none of health and safety; so\r\nmuch so, that Cato the Censor, when speaking to his son in relation to\r\nthose who appear to be in good health, declared, as though it had been\r\nthe enunciation of some oracle,[1309] that precocity in youth is a sign\r\nof an early death.[1310]\r\n\r\nThe number of diseases is infinite. Pherecydes of Scyros died from\r\nvast numbers of worms issuing from his body.[1311] Some persons are\r\ndistressed by a perpetual fever; such was the case with C. Mæcenas;\r\nduring the last three years of his life, he could never get a single\r\nmoment’s sleep.[1312] Antipater of Sidon, the poet, was attacked with\r\nfever every year, and that only on his birthday; he died of it at an\r\nadvanced age.[1313]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53. (52.)—PERSONS WHO HAVE COME TO LIFE AGAIN AFTER BEING LAID\r\nOUT FOR BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAviola,[1314] a man of consular rank, came to life again when on\r\nthe funeral pile; but, by reason of the violence of the flames, no\r\nassistance could be rendered him, in consequence of which he was burnt\r\nalive. The same thing is said to have happened to L. Lamia, a man of\r\nprætorian rank. Messala, Rufus,[1315] and many other authors, inform\r\nus, that C. Ælius Tubero, who had filled the office of prætor, was\r\nalso rescued from the funeral pile. Such then is the condition of us\r\nmortals: to these and the like vicissitudes of fortune are we born;\r\nso much so, that we cannot be sure of any thing, no, not even that a\r\nperson is dead. With reference to the soul of man, we find, among other\r\ninstances, that the soul of Hermotinus of Clazomenæ was in the habit\r\nof leaving his body, and wandering into distant countries, whence it\r\nbrought back numerous accounts of various things, which could not have\r\nbeen obtained by any one but a person who was present. The body, in the\r\nmeantime, was left apparently lifeless.[1316] At last, however, his\r\nenemies, the Cantharidæ,[1317] as they were called, burned the body, so\r\nthat the soul, on its return, was deprived of its sheath, as it were.\r\nIt is stated also, that in Proconnesus,[1318] the soul of Aristeas\r\nwas seen to fly out of his mouth, under the form of a raven;[1319] a\r\nmost fabulous story, however, which may be well ranked with the one\r\nthat follows. It is told of Epimenides[1320] of Cnossus, that when he\r\nwas a boy, being fatigued by heat and walking, he fell asleep in a\r\ncave, where he slept for fifty-seven years; and that when he awoke, as\r\nthough it had been on the following day, he was much astonished at the\r\nchanges which he saw in the appearance of every thing around him: after\r\nthis, old age, it is said, came upon him in an equal number of days\r\nwith the years he had slept, but his life was prolonged to his hundred\r\nand fifty-seventh year.[1321] The female sex appear more especially\r\ndisposed to this morbid state,[1322] on account of the misplacement of\r\nthe womb;[1323] when this is once corrected, they immediately come to\r\nthemselves again. The volume of Heraclides[1324] on this subject, which\r\nis highly esteemed among the Greeks, contains the account of a female,\r\nwho was restored to life, after having appeared to be dead for seven\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nVarro informs us,[1325] that when he was one of the “vigintiviri,” or\r\ntwenty commissioners,[1326] appointed to superintend the division of\r\nthe lands at Capua, a man who had been carried to the funeral pile,\r\nreturned on foot from the Forum to his own house, and that the very\r\nsame thing happened also at Aquinum. He states also, that Corfidius,\r\nwho had married his maternal aunt, came to life again, after the\r\nfuneral had been all arranged, and that he afterwards attended the\r\nfuneral of the person who had so arranged his own. He gives in addition\r\nsome other marvellous relations, the whole of which it may be as well\r\nto set forth; he says that there were two brothers, members of the\r\nequestrian order, and named Corfidius:[1327] it so happened that the\r\nelder of these was seen to breathe his last to all appearance, and on\r\nopening his will, it was found that he had named his brother his heir,\r\nwho accordingly ordered his funeral. In the meanwhile, however, he who\r\nhad been thought to be dead, clapping his hands,[1328] summoned the\r\nservants, and told them that he was just come from his brother’s house,\r\nwho had placed his daughter in his charge; in addition to which, he\r\nhad mentioned to him the place where he had secretly buried some gold,\r\nand had requested that the funeral preparations which had been made,\r\nmight be employed for himself. While he was stating to this effect,\r\nthe servants of his brother came in the greatest haste, and informed\r\nthem that he was dead: the gold too, was found in the place just as he\r\nhad stated. But throughout the whole of our lives we are perpetually\r\nhearing of such predictions as these; they are not, however, worth\r\ncollecting, seeing that they are almost always false, as we shall\r\nillustrate by the following remarkable instance.\r\n\r\nIn the Sicilian war, Gabienus, the bravest of all Cæsar’s naval\r\ncommanders, was taken prisoner by Sextus Pompeius, who ordered his\r\nthroat to be cut; after which, his head almost severed from his body,\r\nhe lay the whole of the day upon the sea-shore. Towards evening,\r\nwith groans and entreaties, he begged the crowds of people who had\r\nassembled, that they would prevail upon Pompeius to come to him, or\r\nelse send one of his most confidential friends, as he had just returned\r\nfrom the shades below, and had some important news to communicate.\r\nPompeius accordingly sent several of his friends, to whom Gabienus\r\nstated that the good cause and virtuous partisans of Pompeius were well\r\npleasing to the infernal deities, and that the event would shortly\r\nprove such as he wished: that he had been ordered to announce to this\r\neffect, and that, as a proof of its truthfulness, he himself should\r\nexpire the very moment he had fulfilled his commission; and his death\r\nactually did take place.\r\n\r\nWe have instances also of men who have been seen after their burial;\r\nbut, for the present, we are treating of the operations of nature, and\r\nnot of miracles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54. (53.)—INSTANCES OF SUDDEN DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the things that are looked upon as more especially singular,\r\nthough of frequent occurrence, is sudden death, a thing that, in\r\nfact, is the greatest happiness of life, and, as we will shew, only a\r\nnatural occurrence. Verrius has given many instances of it; we will\r\nlimit ourselves by only making a selection. Besides Chilo, who has been\r\nalready mentioned,[1329] Sophocles,[1330] and Dionysius,[1331] the\r\ntyrant of Sicily, both of them, died of joy, on learning that they had\r\nobtained the prize for tragedy. After the defeat at Cannæ, a mother\r\ndied of joy, on seeing that her son had returned in safety, she having\r\nheard a false report of his death.[1332] Diodorus, the professor of\r\nlogic,[1333] died of mortification, because he could not immediately\r\nanswer some question which had been put to him by Stilpo, by way of\r\njoke.\r\n\r\nTwo of the Cæsars,[1334] one of whom was at the time prætor, and the\r\nother had previously discharged that office, and was the father of\r\nthe Dictator Cæsar, died without any apparent cause, in the morning,\r\nwhile putting on their shoes; the former at Pisæ, the latter at Rome.\r\nQuintus Fabius Maximus died during his consulship, on the day before\r\nthe calends of January,[1335] and in his place C. Rebilus got himself\r\nelected consul for only a few hours.[1336] The same thing happened\r\nalso to the senator, C. Volcatius Gurges; these were all of them so\r\nwell, and in such perfect health, that they were actually preparing\r\nto go from home. Q. Æmilius Lepidus,[1337] just as he was leaving\r\nhis house, struck his great toe against the threshold of his chamber\r\ndoor. C. Aufustius, having gone from home, was proceeding to the\r\nsenate-house, when he stumbled in the Comitium,[1338] and expired.\r\nTheir ambassador, who had just been pleading the cause of the Rhodians\r\nin the senate, to the admiration of every one, suddenly expired at\r\nthe door of the senate-house, just as he was about to retire. Cn.\r\nBæbius Tamphilus,[1339] who had been prætor also, expired while he\r\nwas enquiring of a boy[1340] what time it was: Aulus Pompeius[1341]\r\ndied just after saluting the gods in the Capitol; and M. Juventius\r\nThalna,[1342] the consul, while he was sacrificing. C. Servilius Pansa\r\nexpired at the second hour of the day,[1343] while he was standing\r\nin the Forum, near a shop there,[1344] and leaning on the arm of his\r\nbrother, Publius Pansa: the judge Bæbius, while he was giving an order\r\nfor an enlargement of bail:[1345] M. Terentius Corax, while he was\r\nmaking an entry in his note-book in the Forum: only last year too, a\r\nmember of the equestrian order at Rome, while whispering in the ear of\r\na man of consular rank, before the ivory Apollo, in the Forum[1346] of\r\nAugustus;[1347] and, what is more singular than all, C. Julius, the\r\nphysician, while he was applying, with his probe,[1348] some ointment\r\nto the eye of a patient. Aulus Manlius Torquatus, a man of consular\r\nrank, died in the act of reaching a cake at dinner; L. Tuscius Valla,\r\nthe physician, while he was taking a draught of honeyed wine;[1349]\r\nAp. Saufeius, while, on his return from the bath, after drinking\r\nsome honeyed wine and water, he was swallowing an egg: P. Quinctius\r\nScapula, while he was dining with Aquilius Gallus: Decimus Saufeius,\r\nthe scribe, while he was breakfasting at his house. Corn. Gallus,[1350]\r\nwho had filled the office of prætor, and Titus Haterius,[1351] a man\r\nof equestrian rank, died in the venereal act; and, a thing that was\r\nespecially remarked by those of our day, two members of the equestrian\r\norder expired in the embraces of the same actor of pantomimes, Mysticus\r\nby name, who was remarkable for his singular beauty.\r\n\r\nBut the most perfect state, to all appearance, of security from death,\r\nwas that of which we have an account given by the ancients, in the\r\ncase of M. Ofilius Hilarus. He was an actor, and after having been\r\nvery greatly applauded by the people, was giving, on his birthday, an\r\nentertainment. During dinner he called for a cup of warm drink; at the\r\nsame time, looking at the masque which he had worn during the day, he\r\nplaced upon it the chaplet,[1352] which he had taken from his own head;\r\nand in that position he remained rigidly fixed, without moving, no one\r\nbeing aware of what had taken place, until the person who was reclining\r\nnext to him reminded him that the drink was getting cold; upon which he\r\nwas found to be dead.\r\n\r\nThese are instances of persons dying a happy death;[1353] but, on\r\nthe other hand, there are innumerable cases also of unfortunate ends.\r\nL. Domitius,[1354] a member of a most illustrious family, having been\r\nconquered at Massilia by Cæsar, and taken prisoner by him at Corfinium,\r\nbeing weary of life, took poison; but, immediately after, he used\r\nevery possible exertion to prolong his life. We find it stated in our\r\nAnnals, that Felix, a charioteer of the red party,[1355] being placed\r\non the funeral pile, some one of the number of his admirers threw\r\nhimself upon the pile; a most silly piece of conduct. Lest, however,\r\nthis circumstance might be attributed to the great excellence of the\r\ndead man in his art, and so redound to his glory, the other parties all\r\ndeclared that he had been overpowered by the strength of the perfumes.\r\nNot long ago, M. Lepidus, a man of very noble birth, who died, as I\r\nhave stated above,[1356] of chagrin caused by his divorce, was hurled\r\nfrom the funeral pile by the violence of the flames, and in consequence\r\nof the heat, could not be replaced upon it; in consequence of which,\r\nhis naked body was burnt with some other pieces of brushwood, in the\r\nvicinity of the pile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55. (54.)—BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe burning of the body after death, among the Romans, is not a very\r\nancient usage; for formerly, they interred it.[1357] After it had been\r\nascertained, however, in the foreign wars, that bodies which had been\r\nburied were sometimes disinterred, the custom of burning them was\r\nadopted. Many families, however, still observed the ancient rites,\r\nas, for example, the Cornelian family, no member of which had his\r\nbody burnt before Sylla, the Dictator; who directed this to be done,\r\nbecause, having previously disinterred the dead body of Caius Marius,\r\nhe was afraid that others might retaliate on his own.[1358] The term\r\n“sepultus”[1359] applies to any mode whatever of disposing of the dead\r\nbody; while, on the other hand, the word “humatus” is applicable solely\r\nwhen it is deposited in the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56. (55.)—THE MANES, OR DEPARTED SPIRITS OF THE SOUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter burial come the different quiddities as to the existence of the\r\nManes. All men, after their last day,[1360] return to what they were\r\nbefore the first; and after death there is no more sensation left in\r\nthe body or in the soul than there was before birth. But this same\r\nvanity of ours extends even to the future, and lyingly fashions to\r\nitself an existence even in the very moments which belong to death\r\nitself: at one time it has conferred upon us the immortality of the\r\nsoul; at another transmigration; and at another it has given sensation\r\nto the shades below, and paid divine honours to the departed spirit,\r\nthus making a kind of deity of him who has but just ceased to be a man.\r\nAs if, indeed, the mode of breathing with man was in any way different\r\nfrom that of other animals, and as if there were not many other animals\r\nto be found whose life is longer than that of man, and yet for whom\r\nno one ever presaged anything of a like immortality. For what is the\r\nactual substance of the soul, when taken by itself? Of what material\r\ndoes it consist? Where is the seat of its thoughts? How is it to see,\r\nor hear, or how to touch? And then, of what use is it, or what can it\r\navail, if it has not these faculties? Where, too, is its residence, and\r\nwhat vast multitudes of these souls and spirits[1361] must there be\r\nafter the lapse of so many ages? But all these are the mere figments\r\nof childish ravings, and of that mortality which is so anxious never\r\nto cease to exist. It is a similar piece of vanity, too, to preserve\r\nthe dead bodies of men; just like the promise that he shall come to\r\nlife again, which was made by Democritus;[1362] who, however, never\r\nhas come to life again himself. Out upon it! What downright madness is\r\nit to suppose that life is to recommence after death! or indeed, what\r\nrepose are we ever to enjoy when we have been once born, if the soul is\r\nto retain its consciousness in heaven, and the shades of the dead in\r\nthe infernal regions? This pleasing delusion, and this credulity, quite\r\ncancel that chief good of human nature, death, and, as it were, double\r\nthe misery of him who is about to die, by anxiety as to what is to\r\nhappen to him after it. And, indeed, if life really is a good, to whom\r\ncan it be so to have once lived?\r\n\r\nHow much more easy, then, and how much more devoid of all doubts, is it\r\nfor each of us to put his trust in himself, and guided by our knowledge\r\nof what our state has been before birth, to assume that that after\r\ndeath will be the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (56.)—THE INVENTORS OF VARIOUS THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the consideration of the nature of man, it appears\r\nonly proper to point out those persons who have been the authors of\r\ndifferent inventions. Father Liber[1363] was the first to establish\r\nthe practice of buying and selling; he also invented the diadem, the\r\nemblem of royalty, and the triumphal procession. Ceres[1364] introduced\r\ncorn, the acorn having been previously used by man for food; it was\r\nshe, also, who introduced into Attica the art of grinding corn[1365]\r\nand of making bread, and other similar arts into Sicily; and it was\r\nfrom these circumstances that she came to be regarded as a divinity.\r\nShe was the first also to establish laws;[1366] though, according\r\nto some, it was Rhadamanthus. I have always been of opinion, that\r\nletters were of Assyrian origin, but other writers, Gellius,[1367] for\r\ninstance, suppose that they were invented in Egypt by Mercury: others,\r\nagain, will have it that they were discovered by the Syrians; and that\r\nCadmus brought from Phœnicia sixteen letters into Greece. To these,\r\nPalamedes, it is said, at the time of the Trojan war, added these four,\r\nΘ, Ξ, Φ, and Χ. Simonides,[1368] the lyric poet, afterwards added a\r\nlike number, Ζ, Η, Ψ, and Ω; the sounds denoted by all of which are now\r\nreceived into our alphabet.[1369]\r\n\r\nAristotle, on the other hand, is rather of opinion, that there were\r\noriginally eighteen letters,[1370] Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ζ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ο Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ\r\nΦ, and that two, Θ namely and Χ, were introduced by Epicharmus,[1371]\r\nand not by Palamedes. Aristides says, that a certain person of the name\r\nof Menos, in Egypt, invented letters fifteen years before the reign\r\nof Phoroneus,[1372] the most ancient of all the kings of Greece, and\r\nthis he attempts to prove by the monuments there. On the other hand,\r\nEpigenes,[1373] a writer of very great authority, informs us that the\r\nBabylonians have a series of observations on the stars, for a period\r\nof seven hundred and twenty thousand years, inscribed on baked bricks.\r\nBerosus and Critodemus, who make the period the shortest, give it as\r\nfour hundred and ninety thousand years.[1374] From this statement,\r\nit would appear that letters have been in use from all eternity. The\r\nPelasgi were the first to introduce them into Latium.\r\n\r\nThe brothers Euryalus and Hyperbius[1375] were the first who\r\nconstructed brick-kilns and houses at Athens; before which, caves\r\nin the ground served for houses. Gellius[1376] is inclined to think\r\nthat Toxius, the son of Cælus, was the first inventor of mortar, it\r\nhaving been suggested to him by the nest of the swallow. Cecrops[1377]\r\ngave to a town the name of Cecropia, after himself; this is now the\r\ncitadel of Athens. Some persons will have it, that Argos had been\r\nfounded before this period by King Phoroneus; others, again, that\r\nSicyon had been previously built; while the Egyptians declare that\r\ntheir own city, Diospolis, had been in existence long before them.\r\nCinyra,[1378] the son of Agriopas,[1379] invented tiles and discovered\r\ncopper-mines,[1380] both of them in the island of Cyprus; he also\r\ninvented the tongs, the hammer, the lever, and the anvil. Wells were\r\ninvented by Danaus,[1381] who came from Egypt into that part of Greece\r\nwhich had been previously known as Argos Dipsion.\r\n\r\nThe first stone-quarries were opened by Cadmus at Thebes, or else,\r\naccording to Theophrastus, in Phœnicia. Walls were first built by\r\nThrason;[1382] according to Aristotle, towers were first erected by the\r\nCyclopes,[1383] but according to Theophrastus, by the Tirynthii. The\r\nEgyptians invented weaving;[1384] the Lydians of Sardis the art of\r\ndyeing wool.[1385] Closter, the son of Arachne, invented the spindle\r\nfor spinning wool;[1386] Arachne herself, linen cloth and nets;[1387]\r\nNicias of Megara, the art of fulling cloth;[1388] and Tychius, the\r\nBœotian, the art of making shoes.[1389] The Egyptians will have it that\r\nthe medical art was first discovered among them, while others attribute\r\nit to Arabus, the son of Babylonis and Apollo; botany and pharmacy are\r\nascribed to Chiron, the son of Saturn and Philyra.[1390]\r\n\r\nAristotle supposes that Scythes, the Lydian, was the first to fuse\r\nand temper copper, while Theophrastus ascribes the art to Delas, the\r\nPhrygian.[1391] Some persons ascribe the working of copper to the\r\nChalybes, others to the Cyclopes. Hesiod says, that iron was discovered\r\nin Crete, by the Idæan Dactyli.[1392] Erichthonius, the Athenian, or,\r\nas some people say, Æacus, discovered silver.[1393] Gold mines, and the\r\nmode of fusing that metal, were discovered by Cadmus, the Phœnician,\r\nat the mountain of Pangæus,[1394] or, according to other accounts,\r\nby Thoas or Eaclis, in Panchaia;[1395] or else by Sol, the son of\r\nOceanus, whom Gellius mentions as having been the first who employed\r\nhoney in medicine. Midacritus[1396] was the first who brought tin from\r\nthe island called Cassiteris.[1397] The Cyclopes invented the art of\r\nworking iron.[1398] Choræbus, the Athenian, was the first who made\r\nearthen vessels;[1399] but Anacharsis, the Scythian, or, according\r\nto others, Hyperbius, the Corinthian, first invented the potter’s\r\nwheel. Dædalus[1400] was the first person who worked in wood; it was\r\nhe who invented the saw, the axe, the plummet, the gimlet, glue, and\r\nisinglass;[1401] the square, the level, the turner’s lathe, and the\r\nkey, were invented by Theodorus, of Samos.[1402] Measures and weights\r\nwere invented by Phidon, of Argos,[1403] or, according to Gellius, by\r\nPalamedes. Pyrodes, the son of Cilix, was the first to strike fire from\r\nthe flint, and Prometheus taught us how to preserve it, in the stalk of\r\ngiant-fennel.[1404]\r\n\r\nThe Phrygians first taught us the use of the chariot with four\r\nwheels;[1405] the Carthaginians the arts of merchandize,[1406] and\r\nEumolpus, the Athenian,[1407] the cultivation of the vine, and of\r\ntrees in general. Staphylus, the son of Silenus,[1408] was the first\r\nto mix water with wine; olive-oil and the oil-press, as also honey, we\r\nowe to Aristæus, the Athenian;[1409] the use of oxen and the plough\r\nto Buzyges, the Athenian,[1410] or, according to other accounts, to\r\nTriptolemus.[1411]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were the first who established a monarchical government,\r\nand the Athenians, after the time of Theseus, a democracy.\r\nPhalaris,[1412] of Agrigentum, was the first tyrant[1413] that existed;\r\nthe Lacedæmonians were the introducers of slavery;[1414] and the first\r\ncapital punishment inflicted was ordered by the Areiopagus.[1415] The\r\nfirst battles were fought by the Africans against the Egyptians, with\r\nclubs, which they are in the habit of calling phalangæ. Prœtus and\r\nAcrisius[1416] were the first to use shields, in their contests with\r\neach other; or, as some say, Chalcus, the son of Athamas. Midias,\r\nthe Messenian, invented the coat of mail, and the Lacedæmonians\r\nthe helmet, the sword, and the spear.[1417] Greaves and crests\r\nwere first used by the Carians; Scythes, the son of Jupiter, it is\r\nsaid, invented the bow and arrows, though some say that arrows were\r\ninvented by Perses, the son of Perseus.[1418] Lances were invented\r\nby the Ætolians; the javelin, with the thong[1419] attached, by\r\nÆtolus,[1420] the son of Mars; the spear of the light infantry[1421]\r\nby Tyrrhenus; the dart[1422] by Penthesilea, the Amazon; the axe by\r\nPisæus; the hunting-spear, and the scorpion to hurl missiles, by the\r\nCretans;[1423] the catapulta, the balista,[1424] and the sling, by the\r\nSyrophœnicians.[1425] Pisæus, the Tyrrhenian, was the first to invent\r\nthe brazen trumpet,[1426] and Artemon, of Clazomenæ, the use of the\r\ntestudo.[1427] The battering-horse, for the destruction of walls,\r\nwhich is at the present day styled the “ram,” was invented by Epeus,\r\nat Troy.[1428] Bellerophon was the first who mounted the horse;[1429]\r\nbridles and saddles for the horse were invented by Pelethronius.[1430]\r\nThe Thessalians, who are called Centauri, and who dwell along Mount\r\nPelion, were the first to fight on horse-back. The people of Phrygia\r\nwere the first who used chariots with two horses; Erichthonius first\r\nused four.[1431] Palamedes, during the Trojan war, was the first who\r\nmarshalled an army, and invented watchwords,[1432] signals, and the\r\nuse of sentinels. Sinon, at the same period, invented the art of\r\ncorrespondence by signals. Lycaon was the first to think of making a\r\ntruce, and Theseus a treaty of alliance.\r\n\r\nThe art of divination by means of birds[1433] we owe to Car, from\r\nwhom Caria derives its name; Orpheus extended it to other animals.\r\nDelphus taught us the art of divining by the inspection of entrails;\r\nAmphiaraüs[1434] divination by fire; and Tiresias, the Theban,\r\npresages from the entrails of birds. We owe to Amphictyon[1435] the\r\ninterpretation of portents and of dreams, and to Atlas,[1436] the son\r\nof Libya, the art of astrology, or else, according to other accounts,\r\nto the Egyptians or the Assyrians. Anaximander,[1437] the Milesian,\r\ninvented the astronomical sphere; and Æolus, the son of Hellen, gave us\r\nthe theory of the winds.\r\n\r\nAmphion was the inventor of music;[1438] Pan, the son of Mercury,\r\nthe music of the reed, and the flute with the single pipe; Midas,\r\nthe Phrygian,[1439] the transverse flute;[1440] and Marsyas, of the\r\nsame country, the double-pipe.[1441] Amphion invented the Lydian\r\nmeasures in music; Thamyris the Thracian, the Dorian, and Marsyas\r\nthe Phrygian, the Phrygian style.[1442] Amphion, or, according to\r\nsome accounts, Orpheus, and according to others, Linus, invented the\r\nlyre.[1443] Terpander, adding three to the former four, increased the\r\nnumber of strings to seven; Simonides added an eighth, and Timotheus a\r\nninth.[1444] Thamyris was the first who played on the lyre, without the\r\naccompaniment of the voice; and Amphion, or, as some say, Linus, was\r\nthe first who accompanied it with the voice. Terpander was the first\r\nwho composed songs expressly for the lyre; and Ardalus, the Trœzenian,\r\nwas the first who taught us how to combine the voice with the music of\r\nthe pipe.[1445] The Curetes taught us the dance in armour,[1446] and\r\nPyrrhus, the Pyrrhic dance, both of them in Crete.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Pythian oracle for the first heroic verse.[1447]\r\nA very considerable question has arisen, as to what was the origin\r\nof poetry; it is well known to have existed before the Trojan war.\r\nPherecydes of Scyros, in the time of King Cyrus, was the first to write\r\nin prose, and Cadmus, the Milesian, was the first historian.[1448]\r\n\r\nLycaon[1449] first instituted gymnastic games, in Arcadia; Acastus\r\nfunereal games,[1450] at Iolcos;[1451] and, after him, Theseus\r\ninstituted them at the Isthmus.[1452] Hercules first instituted the\r\nathletic contests at Olympia.[1453] Pythus invented the game of\r\nball.[1454] Painting was invented in Egypt by Gyges, the Lydian,[1455]\r\nor, according to Aristotle, in Greece, by Euchir, a kinsman[1456]\r\nof Dædalus; according to Theophrastus, again, it was invented by\r\nPolygnotus, the Athenian.\r\n\r\nDanaüs was the first who passed over in a ship from Egypt to\r\nGreece.[1457] Before his time, they used to sail on rafts,[1458] which\r\nhad been invented by King Erythras,[1459] to pass from one island to\r\nanother in the Red Sea. There are some writers to be found, who are of\r\nopinion that they were first thought of by the Mysians and the Trojans,\r\nfor the purpose of crossing the Hellespont into Thrace. Even at the\r\npresent day, they are made in the British ocean, of wicker-work covered\r\nwith hides;[1460] on the Nile they are made of papyrus, rushes, and\r\nreeds.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Philostephanus, that Jason was the first person who\r\nsailed in a long vessel;[1461] Hegesias says it was Paralus,\r\nCtesias,[1462] Semiramis,[1463] and Archemachus, Ægæon. According to\r\nDamastes,[1464] the Erythræi[1465] were the first to construct vessels\r\nwith two banks of oars; according to Thucydides,[1466] Aminocles, the\r\nCorinthian, first constructed them with three banks of oars; according\r\nto Aristotle, the Carthaginians, those with four banks; according to\r\nMnesigiton, the people of Salamis, those with five banks;[1467] and,\r\naccording to Xenagoras, the Syracusans, those with six; those above\r\nsix, as far as ten, Mnesigiton says were first constructed by Alexander\r\nthe Great. From Philostephanus, we learn that Ptolemy Soter made\r\nthem as high as twelve banks; Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, with\r\nfifteen; Ptolemy Philadelphus, with thirty; and Ptolemy Philopater,\r\nwho was surnamed Tryphon, with forty.[1468] Hippus, the Tyrian, was\r\nthe first who invented merchant-ships; the Cyrenians, the pinnace;\r\nthe Phœnicians, the passage-boat; the Rhodians, the skiff; and the\r\nCyprians, the cutter.[1469]\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Phœnicians for the first observation of the\r\nstars in navigation; the Copæ invented the oar, and the Platæans\r\ngave it its broad blade.[1470] Icarus was the person who invented\r\nsails,[1471] and Dædalus the mast and yards; the Samians, or else\r\nPericles, the Athenian, transports for horses,[1472] and the Thracians,\r\nlong covered vessels,[1473]—before which time they used to fight only\r\nfrom the prow or the stern. Pisæus, the Tyrrhenian, added the beak to\r\nships;[1474] Eupalamus, the anchor; Anacharsis, that with two flukes;\r\nPericles, the Athenian, grappling-irons, and hooks like hands;[1475]\r\nand Tiphys,[1476] the helm and rudder. Minos was the first who waged\r\nwar by means of ships; Hyperbius, the son of Mars, the first who killed\r\nan animal; and Prometheus, the first who slew the ox.[1477]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58. (57.)—THE THINGS ABOUT WHICH MANKIND FIRST OF ALL AGREED. THE\r\nANCIENT LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was at the very earliest[1478] period a tacit consent among all\r\nnations to adopt the letters now used by the Ionians.[1479] (58.)\r\nThat the ancient Greek letters were almost the same with the modern\r\nLatin,[1480] is proved by the ancient Delphic inscription on copper,\r\nwhich is now in the Palatine library, having been dedicated by the\r\nemperors to Minerva; this inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n  ΝΑΥΣΙΚΡΑΤΗΣ ΑΝΕΘΕΤΟ ΤΗΙ ΔΙΟΣ ΚΟΡΗΙ.\r\n\r\n  [“Nausicrates offered this to the daughter of Zeus.”][1481]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59. (59.)—WHEN BARBERS WERE FIRST EMPLOYED.[1482]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next point upon which all nations appear to have agreed, was the\r\nemployment of barbers.[1483] The Romans, however, were more tardy\r\nin the adoption of their services. According to Varro, they were\r\nintroduced into Italy from Sicily, in the year of Rome 454,[1484]\r\nhaving been brought over by P. Titinius Mena: before which time the\r\nRomans did not cut the hair. The younger Africanus[1485] was the first\r\nwho adopted the custom of shaving every day. The late Emperor Augustus\r\nalways made use of razors.[1486]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60.—WHEN THE FIRST TIME-PIECES WERE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(60.) The third point of universal agreement was the division of time,\r\na subject which afterwards appealed to the reasoning faculties. We have\r\nalready stated, in the Second Book,[1487] when and by whom this art\r\nwas first invented in Greece; the same was also introduced at Rome,\r\nbut at a later period. In the Twelve Tables, the rising and setting of\r\nthe sun are the only things that are mentioned relative to time. Some\r\nyears afterwards, the hour of midday was added, the summoner[1488] of\r\nthe consuls proclaiming it aloud, as soon as, from the senate-house, he\r\ncaught sight of the sun between the Rostra and the Græcostasis;[1489]\r\nhe also proclaimed the last hour, when the sun had gone down from the\r\nMænian column[1490] to the prison. This, however, could only be done\r\nin clear weather, but it was continued until the first Punic war. The\r\nfirst sun-dial is said to have been erected among the Romans twelve\r\nyears before the war with Pyrrhus, by L. Papirius Cursor,[1491] at\r\nthe temple of Quirinus,[1492] on which occasion he dedicated it in\r\npursuance of a vow which had been made by his father. This is the\r\naccount given by Fabius Vestalis; but he makes no mention of either the\r\nconstruction of the dial or the artist, nor does he inform us from what\r\nplace it was brought, or in whose works he found this statement made.\r\n\r\nM. Varro[1493] says that the first sun-dial, erected for the use of\r\nthe public, was fixed upon a column near the Rostra, in the time of\r\nthe first Punic war, by the consul M. Valerius Messala, and that it\r\nwas brought from the capture of Catina, in Sicily: this being thirty\r\nyears after the date assigned to the dial of Papirius, and the year\r\nof Rome 491. The lines in this dial did not exactly agree with the\r\nhours;[1494] it served, however, as the regulator of the Roman time\r\nninety-nine years, until Q. Marcius Philippus, who was censor with L.\r\nPaulus, placed one near it, which was more carefully arranged: an act\r\nwhich was most gratefully acknowledged, as one of the very best of his\r\ncensorship. The hours, however, still remained a matter of uncertainty,\r\nwhenever the weather happened to be cloudy, until the ensuing lustrum;\r\nat which time Scipio Nasica, the colleague of Lænas, by means of\r\na clepsydra, was the first to divide the hours of the day and the\r\nnight into equal parts: and this time-piece he placed under cover and\r\ndedicated, in the year of Rome 595;[1495] for so long a period had the\r\nRomans remained without any exact division of the day. We will now\r\nreturn to the history of the other animals, and first to that of the\r\nterrestrial.\r\n\r\nSummary.—Remarkable events, narratives, and observations, seven hundred\r\nand forty-seven.\r\n\r\nRoman authors quoted.—Verrius Flaccus,[1496] Cneius Gellius,[1497]\r\nLicinius Mutianus,[1498] Massurius Sabinius,[1499] Agrippina, the\r\nwife of Claudius,[1500] M.

(1.)—ELEPHANTS; THEIR CAPACITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to the other animals, and first of all to the land\r\nanimals. The elephant is the largest of them all, and in intelligence\r\napproaches the nearest to man. It understands the language of its\r\ncountry, it obeys commands, and it remembers all the duties which it\r\nhas been taught. It is sensible alike of the pleasures of love and\r\nglory, and, to a degree that is rare among men even, possesses notions\r\nof honesty, prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also for\r\nthe stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon.[1570] It is\r\nsaid by some authors, that, at the first appearance of the new moon,\r\nherds of these animals come down from the forests of Mauritania to a\r\nriver, the name of which is Amilo;[1571] and that they there purify\r\nthemselves in solemn form by sprinkling their bodies with water; after\r\nwhich, having thus saluted the heavenly body, they return to the woods,\r\ncarrying before them[1572] the young ones which are fatigued. They are\r\nsupposed to have a notion, too, of the differences of religion;[1573]\r\nand when about to cross the sea, they cannot be prevailed upon to go\r\non board the ship, until their keeper has promised upon oath that they\r\nshall return home again. They have been seen, too, when worn out by\r\ndisease, (for even these vast masses are liable to disease,) lying on\r\ntheir back, and throwing the grass up into the air, as if deputing the\r\nearth to intercede for them with its prayers.[1574] As a proof of their\r\nextreme docility, they pay homage to the king, fall upon their knees,\r\nand offer him the crown. Those of smaller growth, which the Indians\r\ncall bastards,[1575] are employed by them in ploughing.[1576]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (2.)—WHEN ELEPHANTS WERE FIRST PUT INTO HARNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first harnessed elephants that were seen at Rome, were in the\r\ntriumph of Pompeius Magnus over Africa, when they drew his chariot;\r\na thing that is said to have been done long before, at the triumph\r\nof Father Liber on the conquest of India. Procilius[1577] says, that\r\nthose which were used at the triumph of Pompeius, were unable to go in\r\nharness through the gate of the city. In the exhibition of gladiators\r\nwhich was given by Germanicus,[1578] the elephants performed a sort of\r\ndance with their uncouth and irregular movements. It was a common thing\r\nto see them throw arrows with such strength, that the wind was unable\r\nto turn them from their course, to imitate among themselves the combats\r\nof the gladiators, and to frolic through the steps of the Pyrrhic\r\ndance.[1579] After this, too, they walked upon the tight-rope,[1580]\r\nand four of them would carry a litter in which lay a fifth, which\r\nrepresented a woman lying-in. They afterwards took their places at\r\ntable, reclining upon couches which were filled with people; and so\r\nnicely did they manage their steps, that they did not so much as touch\r\nany of those who were drinking there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (3.)—THE DOCILITY OF THE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact,[1581] that one of these animals, who was\r\nslower than usual in learning what was taught him, and had been\r\nfrequently chastised with blows, was found conning over his lesson in\r\nthe night-time.[1582] It is a most surprising thing also, that the\r\nelephant is able not only to walk up the tight-rope backwards; but\r\nto come down it as well, with the head foremost.[1583] Mutianus, who\r\nwas three times consul, informs us that one of these animals had been\r\ntaught to trace the Greek letters, and that he used to write in that\r\nlanguage the following words: “I have myself written these words, and\r\nhave dedicated the Celtic spoils.”[1584] Mutianus states also, that he\r\nhimself was witness to the fact, that when some elephants were being\r\nlanded at Puteoli[1585] and were compelled to leave the ship, being\r\nterrified at the length of the platform, which extended from the vessel\r\nto the shore, they walked backwards, in order to deceive themselves by\r\nforming a false estimate of the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—WONDERFUL THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese animals are well aware that the only spoil that we are anxious\r\nto procure of them is the part which forms their weapon of defence, by\r\nJuba, called their horns, but by Herodotus, a much older writer, as\r\nwell as by general usage and more appropriately, their teeth.[1586]\r\nHence it is that, when their tusks have fallen off, either by accident\r\nor from old age, they bury them in the earth.[1587] These tusks form\r\nthe only real ivory, and, even in these, the part which is covered by\r\nthe flesh is merely common bone, and of no value whatever; though,\r\nindeed, of late, in consequence of the insufficient supply of ivory,\r\nthey have begun to cut the bones as well into thin plates. Large\r\nteeth, in fact, are now rarely found, except in India, the demands\r\nof luxury[1588] having exhausted all those in our part of the world.\r\nThe youthfulness of the animal is ascertained by the whiteness of the\r\nteeth.[1589] These animals take the greatest care of their teeth;\r\nthey pay especial attention to the point of one of them, that it may\r\nnot be found blunt when wanted for combat; the other they employ for\r\nvarious purposes, such as digging up roots and pushing forward heavy\r\nweights. When they are surrounded by the hunters, they place those in\r\nfront which have the smallest teeth, that the enemy may think that the\r\nspoil is not worth the combat; and afterwards, when they are weary of\r\nresistance, they break off their teeth, by dashing them against a\r\ntree, and in this manner pay their ransom.[1590]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (4.)—THE INSTINCT OF WILD ANIMALS IN PERCEIVING DANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful thing, that most animals are aware why it is that\r\nthey are sought after, and what it is, that, under all circumstances,\r\nthey have to guard against. When an elephant happens to meet a man in\r\nthe desert, who is merely wandering about, the animal, it is said,\r\nshows himself both merciful and kind, and even points out the way.\r\nBut the very same animal, if he meets with the traces of a man,[1591]\r\nbefore he meets the man himself, trembles in every limb, for fear of an\r\nambush, stops short and scents the wind, looks around him, and snorts\r\naloud with rage; and then, without trampling upon the object, digs it\r\nup,[1592] and passes it to the next one, who again passes it to the\r\none that follows, and so on from one to the other, till it comes to\r\nthe very last. The herd then faces about, returns, and ranges itself\r\nin order of battle; so strongly does the odour, in all cases, attach\r\nitself to the human footstep, even though, as is most frequently the\r\ncase, the foot itself is not naked. In the same way, too, the tigress,\r\nwhich is the dread of the other wild beasts, and which sees, without\r\nalarm, the traces even of the elephant itself, is said at once, upon\r\nseeing the footsteps of man, to carry off her whelps. How has the\r\nanimal acquired this knowledge? And where has it seen him before, of\r\nwhom it stands in such dread? Doubt there can be none, that forests\r\nsuch as it haunts are but little frequented by man! It is not to be\r\nwondered at, if they are astonished at the print of a footstep before\r\nunknown; but how should they know that there is anything that they\r\nought to dread? And, what is still more, why should they dread even\r\nthe very sight of man, seeing that they are so far superior to him in\r\nstrength, size, and swiftness? No doubt, such is the law of Nature,\r\nsuch is the influence of her power—the most savage and the very largest\r\nof wild beasts have never seen that which they have reason to fear, and\r\nyet instantly have an instinctive feeling of dread, when the moment has\r\ncome for them to fear.[1593]\r\n\r\n(5.) Elephants always move in herds.[1594] The oldest takes the lead,\r\nand the next in age brings up the rear. When they are crossing a river,\r\nthey first send over the smallest, for fear lest the weight of the\r\nlarger ones may increase the depth of the channel, by working away the\r\nbed of the river. We learn from Antipater, that King Antiochus had two\r\nelephants, which he employed in his wars, and to which he had given\r\nthe names of celebrated men; and that they were aware too of this mark\r\nof distinction.[1595] Cato, in his Annals, while he has passed over in\r\nsilence the names of the generals, has given that of an elephant called\r\nSurus, which fought with the greatest valour in the Carthaginian army,\r\nand had lost one of its tusks. When Antiochus was sounding the ford of\r\na river, an elephant named Ajax, which on other occasions had always\r\nled the van, refused to enter the stream; upon which proclamation was\r\nmade, that the first rank should belong to the one which should take\r\nthe lead in passing over. One called Patroclus hazarded the attempt,\r\nand as a reward, the king presented it with some silver pendants,[1596]\r\na kind of ornament with which these animals are particularly delighted,\r\nand assigned it all the other marks of command. Upon this, the\r\nelephant that had been degraded refused to take its food, and so\r\npreferred death to ignominy. Indeed their sense of shame is wonderful,\r\nand when one of them has been conquered, it flies at the voice of the\r\nconqueror, and presents him with earth and vervain.[1597]\r\n\r\nThese animals are sensible to feelings of modesty; they never couple\r\nbut in secret:[1598] the male after it has attained its fifth year, the\r\nfemale after the age of ten.[1599] It is said, that their intercourse\r\ntakes place only every second year, and for five days only, and no\r\nmore; on the sixth day they plunge into a river, before doing which\r\nthey will not rejoin the herd. Adulterous intercourse is unknown to\r\nthem, and they have none of those deadly combats for the possession\r\nof the female, which take place among the other animals. Nor is this\r\nbecause they are uninfluenced by the passion of love. One in Egypt,\r\nwe are told, fell in love with a woman, who was a seller of garlands;\r\nand let no one suppose that he made a vulgar choice, for she was the\r\nespecial object of the love of Aristophanes, who held the very highest\r\nrank as a grammarian. Another became attached to the youth Menander,\r\na native of Syracuse, in the army of Ptolemy; whenever it did not see\r\nhim, it would manifest the regret which it experienced, by refusing its\r\nfood. Juba gives an account also of a female who dealt in perfumes, to\r\nwhom one of these creatures formed an attachment. All these animals\r\nmanifested their attachment by their signs of joy at the sight of\r\nthe person, by their awkward caresses, and by keeping for them and\r\nthrowing into their bosom the pieces of money which the public had\r\ngiven them.[1600] Nor, indeed, ought we to be surprised, that an\r\nanimal which possesses memory should be sensible of affection: for\r\nthe same author relates, that an elephant recognized, after the lapse\r\nof many years, an old man who had been its keeper in his youth. They\r\nwould seem also to have an instinctive feeling of justice. King Bocchus\r\nonce fastened thirty elephants to the stake, with the determination of\r\nwreaking his vengeance on them, by means of thirty others; but though\r\nmen kept sallying forth among them to goad them on, he could not, with\r\nall his endeavours, force them to become the ministers of the cruelty\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (6.)—WHEN ELEPHANTS WERE FIRST SEEN IN ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nElephants were seen in Italy, for the first time, in the war with King\r\nPyrrhus,[1601] in the year of the City 472; they were called “Lucanian\r\noxen,” because they were first seen in Lucania.[1602] Seven years\r\nafter this period, they appeared at Rome in a triumph.[1603] In the\r\nyear 502 a great number of them were brought to Rome, which had been\r\ntaken by the pontiff Metellus, in his victory gained in Sicily over\r\nthe Carthaginians;[1604] they were one hundred and forty-two[1605] in\r\nnumber, or, as some say, one hundred and forty, and were conveyed to\r\nour shores upon rafts, which were constructed on rows of hogsheads\r\njoined together. Verrius informs us, that they fought in the Circus,\r\nand that they were slain with javelins, for want of some better method\r\nof disposing of them; as the people neither liked to keep them nor yet\r\nto give them to the kings.[1606] L. Piso tells us only that they were\r\nbrought into the Circus; and for the purpose of increasing the feeling\r\nof contempt towards them, they were driven all round the area of that\r\nplace by workmen, who had nothing but spears blunted at the point. The\r\nauthors who are of opinion that they were not killed, do not, however,\r\ninform us how they were afterwards disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (7.)—THE COMBATS OF ELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a famous combat mentioned of a Roman with an elephant, when\r\nHannibal compelled our prisoners to fight against each other. The one\r\nwho had survived all the others he placed before an elephant, and\r\npromised him his life if he should slay it; upon which the man advanced\r\nalone into the arena, and, to the great regret of the Carthaginians,\r\nsucceeded in doing so.[1607] Hannibal, however, thinking that the news\r\nof this victory might cause a feeling of contempt for these animals,\r\nsent some horsemen to kill the man on his way home. In our battles\r\nwith Pyrrhus it was found, on making trial, that it was extremely easy\r\nto cut off the trunks of these animals.[1608] Fenestella informs us,\r\nthat they fought at Rome in the Circus for the first time during the\r\ncurule ædileship of Claudius Pulcher, in the consulship of M. Antonius\r\nand A. Postumius, in the year of the City 655; and that twenty years\r\nafterwards, during the curule ædileship of the Luculli, they were set\r\nto fight against bulls. In the second consulship[1609] of Pompeius, at\r\nthe dedication of the temple of Venus Victrix,[1610] twenty elephants,\r\nor, as some say, seventeen, fought in the Circus against a number\r\nof Gætulians, who attacked them with javelins. One of these animals\r\nfought in a most astonishing manner; being pierced through the feet,\r\nit dragged itself on its knees towards the troop, and seizing their\r\nbucklers, tossed them aloft into the air: and as they came to the\r\nground they greatly amused the spectators, for they whirled round and\r\nround in the air, just as if they had been thrown up with a certain\r\ndegree of skill,[1611] and not by the frantic fury of a wild beast.\r\nAnother very wonderful circumstance happened; an elephant was killed\r\nby a single blow. The weapon pierced the animal below the eye, and\r\nentered the vital part of the head. The elephants attempted, too, by\r\ntheir united efforts, to break down the enclosure, not without great\r\nconfusion among the people who surrounded the iron gratings.[1612] It\r\nwas in consequence of this circumstance, that Cæsar, the Dictator, when\r\nhe was afterwards about to exhibit a similar spectacle, had the arena\r\nsurrounded with trenches[1613] of water, which were lately filled up\r\nby the Emperor Nero,[1614] when he added the seats for the equestrian\r\norder.[1615] When, however, the elephants in the exhibition given by\r\nPompeius had lost all hopes of escaping, they implored the compassion\r\nof the multitude by attitudes which surpass all description, and\r\nwith a kind of lamentation bewailed their unhappy fate. So greatly\r\nwere the people affected by the scene, that, forgetting the general\r\naltogether, and the munificence which had been at such pains to do them\r\nhonour, the whole assembly rose up in tears, and showered curses on\r\nPompeius, of which he soon afterwards became the victim. They fought\r\nalso in the third consulship of the Dictator Cæsar, twenty of them\r\nagainst five hundred foot soldiers.[1616] On another occasion twenty\r\nelephants, carrying towers,[1617] and each defended by sixty men, were\r\nopposed to the same number of foot soldiers as before, and an equal\r\nnumber of horsemen. Afterwards, under the Emperors Claudius and Nero,\r\nthe last exploit[1618] that the gladiators performed was fighting\r\nsingle-handed[1619] with elephants.\r\n\r\nThe elephant is said to display such a merciful disposition towards\r\nanimals that are weaker than itself, that, when it finds itself in a\r\nflock of sheep, it will remove with its trunk[1620] those that are\r\nin the way, lest it should unintentionally trample upon them.[1621]\r\nThey will never do any mischief except when provoked, and they are of\r\na disposition so sociable, that they always move about in herds, no\r\nanimal being less fond of a solitary life. When surrounded by a troop\r\nof horsemen, they place in the centre of the herd those that are weak,\r\nweary, or wounded, and then take the front rank each in its turn, just\r\nas though they acted under command and in accordance with discipline.\r\nWhen taken captive, they are very speedily tamed, by being fed on the\r\njuices of barley.[1622]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (8.)—THE WAY IN WHICH ELEPHANTS ARE CAUGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn India[1623] they are caught by the keeper guiding one of the tame\r\nelephants towards a wild one which he has found alone or has separated\r\nfrom the herd; upon which he beats it, and when it is fatigued mounts\r\nand manages it just the same way as the other. In Africa[1624] they\r\ntake them in pit-falls; but as soon as an elephant gets into one, the\r\nothers immediately collect boughs of trees and pile up heaps of earth,\r\nso as to form a mound, and then endeavour with all their might to drag\r\nit out. It was formerly the practice to tame them by driving the herds\r\nwith horsemen into a narrow defile, artificially made in such a way\r\nas to deceive them by its length; and when thus enclosed by means of\r\nsteep banks and trenches, they were rendered tame by the effects of\r\nhunger; as a proof of which, they would quietly take a branch that was\r\nextended to them by one of the men. At the present day, when we take\r\nthem for the sake of their tusks, we throw darts at their feet, which\r\nare in general the most tender part of their body. The Troglodytæ, who\r\ninhabit the confines of Æthiopia, and who live entirely on the flesh\r\nof elephants procured by the chase, climb the trees which lie near the\r\npaths through which these animals usually pass. Here they keep a watch,\r\nand look out for the one which comes last in the train; leaping down\r\nupon its haunches, they seize its tail with the left hand, and fix\r\ntheir feet firmly upon the left thigh. Hanging down in this manner,\r\nthe man, with his right hand, hamstrings the animal on one side, with\r\na very sharp hatchet. The elephant’s pace being retarded by the wound,\r\nhe cuts the tendons of the other ham, and then makes his escape; all of\r\nwhich is done with the very greatest celerity. Others, again, employ\r\na much safer, though less certain method; they fix in the ground, at\r\nconsiderable intervals, very large bows upon the stretch; these are\r\nkept steady by young men remarkable for their strength, while others,\r\nexerting themselves with equal efforts, bend them, and so wound the\r\nanimals as they pass by, and afterwards trace them by their blood. The\r\nfemale elephant is much more timid by nature than the male.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (9.)—THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY ARE TAMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nElephants of furious temper are tamed by hunger[1625] and blows, while\r\nother elephants are placed near to keep them quiet, when the violent\r\nfit is upon them, by means of chains. Besides this, they are more\r\nparticularly violent when in heat,[1626] at which time they will level\r\nto the ground the huts of the Indians with their tusks. It is on this\r\naccount that they are prevented from coupling, and the females are kept\r\nin herds separate from the males, just the same way as with other\r\ncattle. Elephants, when tamed, are employed in war, and carry into the\r\nranks of the enemy towers filled with armed men; and on them, in a very\r\ngreat measure, depends the ultimate result of the battles that are\r\nfought in the East. They tread under foot whole companies, and crush\r\nthe men in their armour. The very least sound, however, of the grunting\r\nof the hog terrifies them:[1627] when wounded and panic-stricken, they\r\ninvariably fall back, and become no less formidable for the destruction\r\nwhich they deal to their own side, than to their opponents. The African\r\nelephant is afraid of the Indian, and does not dare so much as look at\r\nit, for the latter is of much greater bulk.[1628]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (10.)—THE BIRTH OF THE ELEPHANT, AND OTHER PARTICULARS\r\nRESPECTING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vulgar notion is, that the elephant goes with young ten\r\nyears;[1629] but, according to Aristotle, it is two years only. He says\r\nalso that the female only bears once, and then a single young one; that\r\nthey live two hundred years, and some of them as much as three hundred.\r\nThe adult age of the elephant begins at the sixtieth year.[1630] They\r\nare especially fond of water, and wander much about streams, and this\r\nalthough they are unable to swim, in consequence of their bulk.[1631]\r\nThey are particularly sensitive to cold, and that, indeed, is their\r\ngreatest enemy. They are subject also to flatulency, and to looseness\r\nof the bowels, but to no other kind of disease.[1632] I find it\r\nstated, that on making them drink oil, any weapons which may happen to\r\nstick in their body will fall out; while, on the contrary, perspiration\r\nmakes them the more readily adhere.[1633] If they eat earth it is\r\npoison to them, unless indeed they have gradually become accustomed by\r\nrepeatedly doing so. They also devour stones as well; but the trunks\r\nof trees are their most favourite food. They throw down, with a blow\r\nfrom their forehead, palms of exceeding height, and when lying on the\r\nground, strip them of their fruit. They eat with the mouth, but they\r\nbreathe, drink,[1634] and smell with [the proboscis], which is not\r\nunaptly termed their “hand.” They have the greatest aversion to the\r\nmouse of all animals,[1635] and quite loathe their food, as it lies\r\nin the manger, if they perceive that it has been touched by one of\r\nthose animals. They experience the greatest torture if they happen\r\nto swallow, while drinking, a horseleech, an animal which people are\r\nbeginning, I find, to call almost universally a “blood-sucker.”[1636]\r\nThe leech fastens upon the wind-pipe, and produces intolerable pain.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the back is extremely hard, that of the belly is softer.\r\nThey are not covered with any kind of bristles, nor yet does the tail\r\neven furnish them with any protection from the annoyance of flies; for\r\nvast as these animals are, they suffer greatly from them. Their skin\r\nis reticulated, and invites these insects by the odour it exhales.\r\nAccordingly, when a swarm of them has settled on the skin, while\r\nextended and smooth, the elephant suddenly contracts it; and, in this\r\nway, the flies are crushed between the folds which are thus closed.\r\nThis power serves them in place of tail, mane, and hair.[1637]\r\n\r\nTheir teeth are very highly prized, and from them we obtain the most\r\ncostly materials for forming the statues of the gods. Luxury has\r\ndiscovered even another recommendation in this animal, having found a\r\nparticularly delicate flavour in the cartilaginous part of the trunk,\r\nfor no other reason, in my belief, than because it fancies itself to be\r\neating ivory.[1638] Tusks of enormous size are constantly to be seen\r\nin the temples; but, in the extreme parts of Africa, on the confines\r\nof Æthiopia, they are employed as door-posts for houses; and Polybius\r\ninforms us, on the authority of the petty king Gulussa,[1639] that they\r\nare also employed as stakes in making fences for the folds of cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (11.)—IN WHAT COUNTRIES THE ELEPHANT IS FOUND; THE ANTIPATHY\r\nOF THE ELEPHANT AND THE DRAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica produces elephants, beyond the deserts of the Syrtes, and in\r\nMauritania; they are found also in the countries of the Æthiopians and\r\nthe Troglodytæ, as mentioned above.[1640] But it is India that produces\r\nthe largest,[1641] as well as the dragon,[1642] which is perpetually at\r\nwar with the elephant, and is itself of so enormous a size, as easily\r\nto envelope the elephants with its folds, and encircle them in its\r\ncoils. The contest is equally fatal to both; the elephant, vanquished,\r\nfalls to the earth, and by its weight, crushes the dragon which is\r\nentwined around it.[1643]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (12.)—THE SAGACITY OF THESE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sagacity which every animal exhibits in its own behalf is\r\nwonderful, but in these it is remarkably so. The dragon has much\r\ndifficulty in climbing up to so great a height, and therefore, watching\r\nthe road, which bears marks of their footsteps when going to feed, it\r\ndarts down upon them from a lofty tree. The elephant knows that it\r\nis quite unable to struggle against the folds of the serpent, and so\r\nseeks for trees or rocks against which to rub itself. The dragon is\r\non its guard against this, and tries to prevent it, by first of all\r\nconfining the legs of the elephant with the folds of its tail; while\r\nthe elephant, on the other hand, endeavours to disengage itself with\r\nits trunk. The dragon, however, thrusts its head into its nostrils, and\r\nthus, at the same moment, stops the breath and wounds the most tender\r\nparts. When it is met unexpectedly, the dragon raises itself up, faces\r\nits opponent, and flies more especially at the eyes; this is the reason\r\nwhy elephants are so often found blind, and worn to a skeleton with\r\nhunger and misery. What other cause can one assign for such mighty\r\nstrifes as these, except that Nature is desirous, as it were, to make\r\nan exhibition for herself, in pitting such opponents against each other?\r\n\r\nThere is another story, too, told in relation to these combats—the\r\nblood of the elephant, it is said, is remarkably cold; for which\r\nreason, in the parching heats of summer,[1644] it is sought by the\r\ndragon with remarkable avidity. It lies, therefore, coiled up and\r\nconcealed in the rivers, in wait for the elephants, when they come to\r\ndrink; upon which it darts out, fastens itself around the trunk, and\r\nthen fixes its teeth behind the ear, that being the only place which\r\nthe elephant cannot protect with the trunk. The dragons, it is said,\r\nare of such vast size, that they can swallow the whole of the blood;\r\nconsequently, the elephant, being thus drained of its blood, falls to\r\nthe earth exhausted; while the dragon, intoxicated with the draught, is\r\ncrushed beneath it, and so shares its fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (13.)—DRAGONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆthiopia produces dragons, not so large as those of India, but still,\r\ntwenty cubits in length.[1645] The only thing that surprises me is,\r\nhow Juba came to believe that they have crests.[1646] The Æthiopians\r\nare known as the Asachæi, among whom they most abound; and we are\r\ntold, that on those coasts four or five of them are found twisted and\r\ninterlaced together like so many osiers in a hurdle, and thus setting\r\nsail, with their heads erect, they are borne along upon the waves, to\r\nfind better sources of nourishment in Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (14.)—SERPENTS OF REMARKABLE SIZE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMegasthenes informs us, that in India, serpents grow to such an immense\r\nsize, as to swallow stags and bulls;[1647] while Metrodorus says, that\r\nabout the river Rhyndacus,[1648] in Pontus, they seize and swallow the\r\nbirds that are flying above them, however high and however rapid their\r\nflight.[1649] It is a well-known fact, that during the Punic war, at\r\nthe river Bagrada, a serpent one hundred and twenty feet in length was\r\ntaken by the Roman army under Regulus, being besieged, like a fortress,\r\nby means of balistæ and other engines of war.[1650] Its skin and jaws\r\nwere preserved in a temple at Rome, down to the time of the Numantine\r\nwar. The serpents which in Italy are known by the name of boa, render\r\nthese accounts far from incredible, for they grow to such a vast size,\r\nthat a child was found entire in the stomach of one of them, which\r\nwas killed on the Vaticanian Hill during the reign of the Emperor\r\nClaudius.[1651] These are nourished, in the first instance, with the\r\nmilk of the cow, and from this they take their name.[1652] As to the\r\nother animals, which have been of late repeatedly brought to Italy from\r\nall parts of the world, it is quite unnecessary to give any minute\r\naccount of their form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (15.)—THE ANIMALS OF SCYTHIA; THE BISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nScythia produces but very few animals, in consequence of the scarcity\r\nof shrubs. Germany, which lies close adjoining it, has not many\r\nanimals, though it has some very fine kinds of wild oxen: the bison,\r\nwhich has a mane, and the urus,[1653] possessed of remarkable strength\r\nand swiftness. To these, the vulgar, in their ignorance, have given\r\nthe name of bubalus:[1654] whereas, that animal is really produced in\r\nAfrica, and rather bears a resemblance to the calf and the stag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—THE ANIMALS OF THE NORTH; THE ELK, THE ACHLIS, AND THE\r\nBONASUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe North, too, produces herds of wild horses, as Africa and Asia do\r\nof wild asses;[1655] there is, also, the elk, which strongly resembles\r\nour steers, except that it is distinguished by the length of the ears\r\nand of the neck. There is also the achlis,[1656] which is produced in\r\nthe island of Scandinavia;[1657] it has never been seen in this city,\r\nalthough we have had descriptions of it from many persons; it is not\r\nunlike the elk, but has no joints in the hind leg. Hence, it never lies\r\ndown, but reclines against a tree while it sleeps; it can only be taken\r\nby previously cutting into the tree, and thus laying a trap for it, as\r\notherwise, it would escape through its swiftness. Its upper lip is so\r\nextremely large, for which reason it is obliged to go backwards when\r\ngrazing; otherwise, by moving onwards, the lip would get doubled up. In\r\nPæonia, it is said, there is a wild animal known as the bonasus;[1658]\r\nit has the mane of the horse, but is, in other respects, like the bull,\r\nwith horns, however, so much bent inwards upon each other, as to be of\r\nno use for the purposes of combat. It has therefore to depend upon its\r\nflight, and, while in the act of flying, it sends forth its excrements,\r\nsometimes to a distance of even three jugera;[1659] the contact of\r\nwhich burns those who pursue the animal, just like a kind of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—LIONS; HOW THEY ARE PRODUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that pards,[1660] panthers, lions, and other\r\nanimals of this kind, walk with the points of their nails concealed in\r\na sheath in the body, lest they should be broken or blunted; and that,\r\nwhen they run, their hooked claws are turned backwards, and are never\r\nextended, except in the act of seizing their prey.[1661]\r\n\r\n(16.) The noble appearance of the lion is more especially to be seen\r\nin that species which has the neck and shoulders covered with a mane,\r\nwhich is always acquired at the proper age by those produced from\r\na lion; while, on the other hand, those that are the offspring of\r\nthe pard, are always without this distinction. The female also has\r\nno mane. The sexual passions of these animals are very violent, and\r\nrender the male quite furious. This is especially the case in Africa,\r\nwhere, in consequence of the great scarcity of water, the wild beasts\r\nassemble in great numbers on the banks of a few rivers. This is also\r\nthe reason why so many curious varieties of animals are produced\r\nthere, the males and females of various species coupling promiscuously\r\nwith each other.[1662] Hence arose the saying, which was common in\r\nGreece even, that “Africa is always producing something new.” The lion\r\nrecognizes, by the peculiar odour of the pard, when the lioness has\r\nbeen unfaithful to him, and avenges himself with the greatest fury.\r\nHence it is, that the female, when she has been guilty of a lapse,\r\nwashes herself, or else follows the lion at a considerable distance.\r\nI find that it was a common belief, that the lioness is able to bear\r\nyoung no more than once, because, while delivering herself, she tears\r\nher womb with her claws.[1663] Aristotle, however, gives a different\r\naccount; a man of whom I think that I ought here to make some further\r\nmention, seeing that upon these subjects, I intend, in a great measure,\r\nto make him my guide. Alexander the Great, being inflamed with a strong\r\ndesire to become acquainted with the natures of animals, entrusted\r\nthe prosecution of this design to Aristotle, a man who held the\r\nhighest rank in every branch of learning; for which purpose he placed\r\nunder his command some thousands of men in every region of Asia and\r\nGreece, and comprising all those who followed the business of hunting,\r\nfowling, or fishing, or who had the care of parks, herds of cattle,\r\nthe breeding of bees, fish-ponds, and aviaries, in order that no\r\ncreature that was known to exist might escape his notice. By means of\r\nthe information which he obtained from these persons, he was enabled\r\nto compose some fifty volumes, which are deservedly esteemed, on the\r\nsubject of animals; of these I purpose to give an epitome, together\r\nwith other facts with which Aristotle was unacquainted; and I beg the\r\nkind indulgence of my readers in their estimate of this work of mine,\r\nas by my aid they hastily travel through all the works of nature, and\r\nthrough the midst of subjects with which that most famous of all kings\r\nso ardently desired to be acquainted.\r\n\r\nAristotle then informs us, that the lioness, at the first birth,\r\nproduces five whelps, and one less every succeeding year, until, after\r\nhaving produced one only, she ceases to bear.[1664] The young ones,\r\nwhen first born, are shapeless and extremely small in flesh, being\r\nno larger than a weasel; for six months they are scarcely able to\r\nwalk,[1665] and until they are two months old, they cannot move. Lions,\r\nhe says, are found in Europe, but only between the rivers Achelous and\r\nNestus; being much superior in strength to those which are produced in\r\nAfrica or Syria.[1666]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF LIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two species of lions; in the one the body is shorter and\r\nmore compact, and the mane more crisp and curly;[1667] these are more\r\ntimid than those with a longer body and straight hair, which, in fact,\r\nhave no fear of wounds. The males raise the leg like the dog, when\r\nthey pass their urine;[1668] which has a most disagreeable odour, the\r\nsame being the case too with their breath. They seldom drink, and only\r\ntake food every other day;[1669] when they have gorged themselves,\r\nthey will sometimes go without food for three days. They swallow\r\ntheir food whole, without mastication, so far as they are able; and\r\nwhen they have taken more than the stomach can possibly receive, they\r\nextract part of it by thrusting their claws into the throat; the same\r\ntoo, if, when full, they have occasion to take to flight. That they\r\nare very long-lived is proved by the fact, that many of them are found\r\nwithout teeth. Polybius,[1670] the companion of Æmilianus, tells us,\r\nthat when they become aged they will attack men, as they have no longer\r\nsufficient strength for the pursuit of wild beasts. It is then that\r\nthey lay siege to the cities of Africa; and for this reason it was,\r\nthat he, as well as Scipio, had seen some of them hung upon a cross;\r\nit being supposed that others, through dread of a similar punishment,\r\nmight be deterred from committing the like outrages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THE LION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lion is the only one of all the wild beasts that shows mercy to\r\nthe suppliant; after it has conquered, it will spare,[1671] and when\r\nenraged, it will vent its fury rather upon men than women, and never\r\nupon children, unless when greatly pressed by hunger. It is the belief\r\nin Libya, that it fully understands the entreaties which are addressed\r\nto it. At all events, I have heard it asserted as a fact, that a\r\nfemale slave, who was returning from Gætulia, was attacked by a number\r\nof lions in the forests; upon which she summoned sufficient courage\r\nto address them, and said that she was a woman, a fugitive, helpless\r\ncreature, that she implored the compassion of the most generous of\r\nanimals, the one that has the command of all the others, and that she\r\nwas a prey unworthy of their high repute—and by these means effectually\r\nsoothed their ferocity. There are various opinions on this point,\r\nas to whether it is through some peculiar disposition of the animal,\r\nor merely by accident, that their fury is thus soothed by addressing\r\nthem. As to what is alleged, too, about serpents, that they can be\r\ndrawn from their holes by singing, and thus be made to yield themselves\r\nup to death, the truth or falsity of it has not by any means been\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained.[1672]\r\n\r\nThe tail of the lion gives indication of the state of his feelings,\r\njust as the ears do in the horse; for these are the distinguishing\r\nsigns which Nature has given to each of the most generous of animals.\r\nHence it is that, when pleased, the tail is without motion, and the\r\nanimal fawns upon those who caress him; a thing, however, that very\r\nrarely happens, for his most frequent state is that of rage. He begins\r\nby beating the earth with his tail; and as he becomes more furious, he\r\nlashes his sides, as if trying to excite himself. His greatest strength\r\nis situate in the breast. From every wound that he makes, whether it\r\nis with his claws or his teeth, a black blood issues.[1673] When his\r\nhunger is satisfied, he becomes harmless. The generous disposition of\r\nthe lion is more especially manifested in time of danger; not only at\r\nthe moment when, despising all weapons, he long defends himself solely\r\nby the terror which he inspires, and protests, as it were, that he\r\nis compelled thus to defend himself, but when he rises at last, not\r\nas though constrained by danger, but as if enraged by the mad folly\r\nof his adversaries. This, however, is a still more noble feature of\r\nhis courage—however numerous the dogs and hunters may be that press\r\nupon him, as he makes his retreat he comes to a stand every now and\r\nthen upon the level plain, while he is still in view, and scowls\r\ncontemptuously upon them: but as soon as ever he has entered the\r\nthickets and dense forests, he scours away at the swiftest possible\r\npace, as though aware that the place itself will shelter his shame.\r\nWhen in pursuit, the lion advances with a leap, but he does not do so\r\nwhen in flight. When wounded, he discovers, with wonderful sagacity,\r\nthe person who struck the blow, and will find him out, however great\r\nmay have been the multitude of his pursuers. If a person has thrown a\r\ndart at him, but has failed to inflict a wound, the animal seizes him,\r\nwhirls him round and throws him to the ground, but without wounding\r\nhim. When the lioness is defending her whelps, it is said that she\r\nfixes her eyes steadily on the ground, that she may not be frightened\r\nat the spears of the hunters. In all other respects, these animals\r\nare equally free from deceit and suspicion. They never look at an\r\nobject obliquely, and they dislike being looked at themselves in such\r\na manner. It is generally believed, that, when the lion is dying,\r\nhe bites at the earth, and sheds tears at his fate.[1674] Powerful,\r\nhowever, and fierce as this animal is, he is terrified by the motion\r\nof wheels or of an empty chariot, and still more on seeing the crest\r\nor hearing the crowing of a cock;[1675] but most of all, is he afraid\r\nof fire. The only malady to which the lion is subject, is loss of\r\nappetite; this, however, is cured by putting insults upon him, by means\r\nof the pranks of monkeys placed about him, a thing which rouses his\r\nanger; immediately he tastes their blood, he is relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—WHO IT WAS THAT FIRST INTRODUCED COMBATS OF LIONS AT ROME,\r\nAND WHO HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER THE GREATEST NUMBER OF LIONS FOR THAT\r\nPURPOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Scævola, the son of P. Scævola, when he was curule ædile, was the\r\nfirst to exhibit at Rome a combat of a number of lions; and L. Sylla,\r\nwho was afterwards Dictator, during his prætorship, gave the spectacle\r\nof a fight of one hundred lions with manes.[1676] After him, Pompeius\r\nMagnus exhibited six hundred lions in the Circus, three hundred and\r\nfifteen of which had manes; Cæsar, the Dictator, exhibited four\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—WONDERFUL FEATS PERFORMED BY LIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was formerly a very difficult matter to catch the lion, and it\r\nwas mostly done by means of pit-falls. In the reign, however, of the\r\nEmperor Claudius, accident disclosed a method which appears almost\r\ndisgraceful to the name of such an animal; a Gætulian shepherd stopped\r\na lion, that was rushing furiously upon him, by merely throwing his\r\ncloak[1677] over the animal; a circumstance which afterwards afforded\r\nan exhibition in the arena of the Circus, when the frantic fury of the\r\nanimal was paralyzed in a manner almost incredible by a light covering\r\nbeing thrown over its head, so much so, that it was put into chains\r\nwithout the least resistance; we must conclude, therefore, that all its\r\nstrength lies in its eyes. This circumstance renders what was done by\r\nLysimachus[1678] less wonderful, who strangled a lion, with which he\r\nhad been shut up by command of Alexander.[1679]\r\n\r\nAntony subjected lions to the yoke, and was the first at Rome to\r\nharness them to his chariot;[1680] and this during the civil war, after\r\nthe battle on the plains of Pharsalia; not, indeed, without a kind of\r\nominous presage, a prodigy that foretold at the time how that generous\r\nspirits were about to be subdued. But to have himself drawn along in\r\nthis manner, in company with the actress Cytheris,[1681] was a thing\r\nthat surpassed even the most monstrous spectacles that were to be\r\nseen at that calamitous period. It is said that Hanno, one of the most\r\nillustrious of the Carthaginians, was the first who ventured to touch\r\nthe lion with the hand, and to exhibit it in a tame state. It was on\r\nthis account that he was banished; for it was supposed, that a man\r\nso talented and so ingenious would have it in his power to persuade\r\nthe people to anything, and it was looked upon as unsafe to trust the\r\nliberties of the country to one who had so eminently triumphed over\r\neven ferocity itself. There are some fortuitous occurrences cited also,\r\nwhich have given occasion to these animals to display their natural\r\nclemency. Mentor, a native of Syracuse, was met in Syria by a lion, who\r\nrolled before him in a suppliant manner; though smitten with fear and\r\ndesirous to escape, the wild beast on every side opposed his flight,\r\nand licked his feet with a fawning air. Upon this, Mentor observed\r\non the paw of the lion a swelling and a wound; from which, after\r\nextracting a splinter, he relieved the creature’s pain.[1682] There\r\nis a picture at Syracuse, which bears witness to the truth of this\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, too, Elpis, a native of Samos, on landing from a\r\nvessel on the coast of Africa, observed a lion near the beach, opening\r\nhis mouth in a threatening manner; upon which he climbed a tree, in the\r\nhope of escaping, while, at the same time, he invoked the aid of Father\r\nLiber; for it is the appropriate time for invocations when there is\r\nno room left for hope. The wild beast did not pursue him as he fled,\r\nalthough he might easily have done so; but, lying down at the foot of\r\nthe tree, by the open mouth which had caused so much terror, tried to\r\nexcite his compassion. A bone, while he was devouring his food with too\r\ngreat avidity, had stuck fast between his teeth, and he was perishing\r\nwith hunger; such being the punishment inflicted upon him by his own\r\nweapons, every now and then he would look up and supplicate him, as it\r\nwere, with mute entreaties. Elpis,[1683] not wishing to risk trusting\r\nhimself to so formidable a beast, remained stationary for some time,\r\nmore at last from astonishment than from fear. At length, however,\r\nhe descended from the tree and extracted the bone, the lion in the\r\nmeanwhile extending his head, and aiding in the operation as far as it\r\nwas necessary for him to do. The story goes on to say, that as long\r\nas the vessel remained off that coast, the lion showed his sense of\r\ngratitude by bringing whatever he had chanced to procure in the chase.\r\nIn memory of this circumstance, Elpis consecrated a temple at Samos to\r\nFather Liber, which the Greeks, from the circumstance above related,\r\ncalled “the temple κεχηνότος Διονύσου,” or “of the open-mouthed\r\nBacchus.” Can we wonder, after this, that the wild beasts should be\r\nable to recognize the footsteps of man,[1684] when of him alone of all\r\nanimals they even hope for aid? For why should they not have recourse\r\nto others for assistance? Or how is it that they know that the hand of\r\nman has power to heal them? Unless, perhaps, it is that the violence of\r\npain can force wild beasts even to risk every thing to obtain relief.\r\n\r\n(17.) Demetrius, the natural philosopher, relates an equally remarkable\r\ninstance, in relation to a panther.[1685] The animal was lying in the\r\nmiddle of the road, waiting for some one to pass that way, when he was\r\nsuddenly perceived by the father of one Philinus, an ardent lover\r\nof wisdom.[1686] Seized with fear, he immediately began to retreat;\r\nwhile the beast rolled itself before him, evidently with the desire\r\nof caressing him, at the same time manifesting signs of grief, which\r\ncould not be misunderstood in a panther even. The animal had young\r\nones, which had happened to fall into a pit at some distance from the\r\nplace. The first dictates of compassion banished all fear, and the next\r\nprompted him to assist the animal. He accordingly followed her, as she\r\ngently drew him on by fixing her claws in his garment; and as soon as\r\nhe discovered what was the cause of her grief and the price of his own\r\nsafety, he took the whelps out of the pit, and they followed her to the\r\nend of the desert; whither he was escorted by her, frisking with joy\r\nand gladness, in order that she might more appropriately testify how\r\ngrateful she was, and how little she had given him in return; a mode of\r\nacting which is but rarely found, among men even.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—A MAN RECOGNIZED AND SAVED BY A DRAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts such as these induce us to give some credit to what Democritus\r\nrelates, who says that a man, called Thoas, was preserved in Arcadia by\r\na dragon.[1687] When a boy, he had become much attached to it, and had\r\nreared it very tenderly; but his father, being alarmed at the nature\r\nand monstrous size of the reptile, had taken and left it in the desert.\r\nThoas being here attacked by some robbers who lay in ambush, he was\r\ndelivered from them by the dragon, which recognized his voice and came\r\nto his assistance. But as to what has been said respecting infants that\r\nhave been exposed and nourished by the milk of wild beasts,[1688] as\r\nin the case of the founders of our city by a wolf, I am disposed to\r\nattribute such cases as these rather to the greatness of the destinies\r\nwhich have to be fulfilled, than to any peculiarity in the nature of\r\nthe animals themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—PANTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panther and the tiger are nearly the only animals that are\r\nremarkable for a skin distinguished by the variety of its spots;[1689]\r\nwhereas others have them of a single colour, appropriate to each\r\nspecies. The lions of Syria alone are black. The spots of the\r\npanther are like small eyes, upon a white ground. It is said that\r\nall quadrupeds are attracted in a most wonderful manner by their\r\nodour,[1690] while they are terrified by the fierceness of their\r\naspect; for which reason the creature conceals its head, and then\r\nseizes upon the animals that are attracted to it by the sweetness of\r\nthe odour. It is said by some, that the panther has, on the shoulder, a\r\nspot which bears the form of the moon; and that, like it, it regularly\r\nincreases to full, and then diminishes to a crescent. At present, we\r\napply the general names of varia[1691] and pard, (which last belongs to\r\nthe males), to all the numerous species of this animal, which is very\r\ncommon in Africa and Syria.[1692] Some writers distinguish the panther,\r\nas being remarkable for its whiteness: but as yet I have not observed\r\nany other difference between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—THE DECREE OF THE SENATE, AND LAWS RESPECTING AFRICAN\r\nANIMALS; WHO FIRST BROUGHT THEM TO ROME, AND WHO BROUGHT THE GREATEST\r\nNUMBER OF THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an ancient decree of the senate, which prohibited animals\r\nbeing imported from Africa into Italy; but Cn. Aufidius, the tribune\r\nof the people,[1693] procured a law repealing this, which allowed of\r\ntheir being brought over for the games of the Circus. Scaurus, in his\r\nædileship,[1694] was the first who sent over the parti-coloured kind,\r\none hundred and fifty in the whole; after which, Pompeius Magnus sent\r\nfour hundred and ten, and the late Emperor Augustus four hundred and\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—TIGERS: WHEN FIRST SEEN AT ROME; THEIR NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same emperor was the first person who exhibited at Rome a tame\r\ntiger[1695] on the stage.[1696] This was in the consulship of Q.\r\nTubero and Fabius Maximus,[1697] at the dedication of the theatre of\r\nMarcellus, on the fourth day before the nones of May: the late Emperor\r\nClaudius exhibited four at one time.[1698]\r\n\r\n(18.) Hyrcania and India produce the tiger, an animal of tremendous\r\nswiftness, a quality which is more especially tested when we deprive it\r\nof all its whelps, which are always very numerous. They are seized by\r\nthe hunter, who lies in wait for them, being provided with the fleetest\r\nhorse he can possibly obtain, and which he frequently changes for a\r\nfresh one. As soon as the female finds her lair empty—for the male\r\ntakes no care whatever of his offspring—headlong she darts forth, and\r\ntraces them by the smell. Her approach is made known by her cries, upon\r\nwhich the hunter throws down one of the whelps; this she snatches up\r\nwith her teeth, and more swift, even, under the weight, returns to her\r\nlair, and then again sets out in pursuit; and this she continues to do,\r\nuntil the hunter has reached his vessel, while the animal vainly vents\r\nher fury upon the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—CAMELS:[1699] THE DIFFERENT KINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCamels are found feeding in herds in the East. Of these there are two\r\ndifferent kinds, those of Bactria and those of Arabia;[1700] the former\r\nkind having two humps on the back, and the latter only one; they have\r\nalso another hump under the breast, by means of which they support\r\nthemselves when reclining. Both of these species, like the ox, have no\r\nteeth in the upper jaw.[1701] They are all of them employed as beasts\r\nof burthen, in carrying loads on the back, and they answer the purpose\r\nof cavalry in battle. Their speed is the same with that of the horse,\r\nbut their power of holding out in this respect is proportioned in\r\neach to its natural strength: it will never go beyond its accustomed\r\ndistance, nor will it receive more than its usual load. The camel has\r\na natural antipathy to the horse.[1702] It can endure thirst for four\r\ndays even, and when it has the opportunity of obtaining water, it\r\ndrinks, as it were, both for past and future thirst, having first taken\r\ncare to trouble the water by trampling in it; without doing which,\r\nit would find no pleasure in drinking. They live fifty years, some\r\nindeed as much as one hundred. These animals, too, are liable to fits\r\nof frenzy.[1703] A peculiar mode of castrating them, and the females,\r\neven, when required for the purposes of war, has been discovered;\r\nit renders them more courageous, by the destruction of all sexual\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—THE CAMELEOPARD; WHEN IT WAS FIRST SEEN AT ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two other[1704] animals, which have some resemblance to the\r\ncamel. One of these is called, by the Æthiopians, the nabun.[1705] It\r\nhas a neck like that of the horse, feet and legs like those of the\r\nox, a head like that of the camel, and is covered with white spots\r\nupon a red ground; from which peculiarities it has been called the\r\ncameleopard.[1706] It was first seen at Rome in the Circensian games\r\nheld by Cæsar, the Dictator.[1707] Since that time too, it has been\r\noccasionally seen. It is more remarkable for the singularity of its\r\nappearance than for its fierceness; for which reason it has obtained\r\nthe name of the wild sheep.[1708]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (19.)—THE CHAMA, AND THE CEPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the games of Pompeius Magnus that the chama[1709] was first\r\nexhibited; an animal called rufius by the Gauls; having the figure\r\nof a wolf, with the spots of the pard. There were also exhibited\r\nsome animals from Æthiopia, which they called by the Greek name,\r\nκήποι,[1710] the hinder extremities of which resembled the human feet\r\nand legs, while the fore-feet were like hands. These animals have not\r\nbeen seen at Rome since that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (20.)—THE RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same games the rhinoceros was also exhibited, an animal\r\nwhich has a single horn projecting from the nose;[1711] it has been\r\nfrequently seen since then. This too is another natural-born enemy of\r\nthe elephant.[1712] It prepares itself for the combat by sharpening its\r\nhorn against the rocks; and in fighting directs it chiefly against the\r\nbelly of its adversary, which it knows to be the softest part. The two\r\nanimals are of equal length, but the legs of the rhinoceros are much\r\nthe shorter: its skin is the colour of box-wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (21.)—THE LYNX, THE SPHINX, THE CROCOTTA, AND THE MONKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆthiopia produces the lynx[1713] in abundance, and the sphinx, which\r\nhas brown hair and two mammæ on the breast,[1714] as well as many\r\nmonstrous kinds of a similar nature; horses with wings, and armed\r\nwith horns, which are called pegasi;[1715] the crocotta, an animal\r\nwhich looks as though it had been produced by the union of the wolf\r\nand the dog,[1716] for it can break any thing with its teeth, and\r\ninstantly on swallowing it digest it with the stomach; monkeys, too,\r\nwith black heads, the hair of the ass, and a voice quite unlike that\r\nof any other animal.[1717] There are oxen, too, like those of India,\r\nsome with one horn, and others with three; the leucrocotta, a wild\r\nbeast of extraordinary swiftness, the size of the wild ass, with the\r\nlegs of a stag, the neck, tail, and breast of a lion, the head of a\r\nbadger, a cloven hoof, the mouth slit up as far as the ears, and one\r\ncontinuous bone instead of teeth;[1718] it is said, too, that this\r\nanimal can imitate the human voice. Among the same people, there is\r\nalso found an animal called eale; it is the size of the river-horse,\r\nhas the tail of the elephant, and is of a black or tawny colour.[1719]\r\nIt has also the jaws of the wild boar, and horns that are moveable,\r\nand more than a cubit in length, so that, in fighting, it can employ\r\nthem alternately, and vary their position by presenting them directly\r\nor obliquely, according as necessity may dictate. But the wild bulls\r\nwhich this country produces are the fiercest of all; they are larger\r\nthan our domestic bull, and exceed all the others in swiftness; are of\r\na tawny colour, with azure eyes, and the hair turned the contrary way;\r\nwhile the jaws open as far as the ears, and the horns are as moveable\r\nas those of the eale. The hide of this animal is as hard as flint, and\r\neffectually resists all wounds. These creatures pursue all the other\r\nwild beasts, while they themselves can only be taken in pitfalls, where\r\nthey always perish from excess of rage. Ctesias informs us, that among\r\nthese same Æthiopians, there is an animal found, which he calls the\r\nmantichora;[1720] it has a triple row of teeth, which fit into each\r\nother like those of a comb, the face and ears of a man, and azure eyes,\r\nis of the colour of blood, has the body of the lion, and a tail ending\r\nin a sting, like that of the scorpion. Its voice resembles the union of\r\nthe sound of the flute and the trumpet; it is of excessive swiftness,\r\nand is particularly fond of human flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are in India oxen also with solid hoofs[1721] and a single\r\nhorn;[1722] and a wild beast called the axis, which has a skin like\r\nthat of a fawn, but with numerous spots on it, and whiter;[1723] this\r\nanimal is looked upon as sacred to Bacchus. The Orsæan Indians hunt\r\ndown a kind of ape, which has the body white[1724] all over; as well\r\nas a very fierce animal called the monoceros,[1725] which has the head\r\nof the stag, the feet of the elephant, and the tail of the boar, while\r\nthe rest of the body is like that of the horse; it makes a deep lowing\r\nnoise, and has a single black horn, which projects from the middle of\r\nits forehead, two cubits in length.[1726] This animal, it is said,\r\ncannot be taken alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—THE ANIMALS OF ÆTHIOPIA; A WILD BEAST WHICH KILLS WITH ITS\r\nEYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Hesperian Æthiopians is the fountain of Nigris, by many,\r\nsupposed to be the head of the Nile. I have already mentioned the\r\narguments by which this opinion is supported.[1727] Near this fountain,\r\nthere is found a wild beast, which is called the catoblepas;[1728] an\r\nanimal of moderate size, and in other respects sluggish in the movement\r\nof the rest of its limbs; its head is remarkably heavy, and it only\r\ncarries it with the greatest difficulty, being always bent down towards\r\nthe earth. Were it not for this circumstance, it would prove the\r\ndestruction of the human race; for all who behold its eyes, fall dead\r\nupon the spot.[1729]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—THE SERPENTS CALLED BASILISKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is the same power also in the serpent called the basilisk.[1730]\r\nIt is produced in the province of Cyrene, being not more than twelve\r\nfingers in length. It has a white spot on the head, strongly resembling\r\na sort of a diadem.[1731] When it hisses, all the other serpents fly\r\nfrom it: and it does not advance its body, like the others, by a\r\nsuccession of folds, but moves along upright and erect upon the middle.\r\nIt destroys all shrubs, not only by its contact, but those even that\r\nit has breathed upon; it burns up all the grass too, and breaks the\r\nstones, so tremendous is its noxious influence. It was formerly a\r\ngeneral belief that if a man on horseback killed one of these animals\r\nwith a spear, the poison would run up the weapon and kill, not only the\r\nrider, but the horse as well. To this dreadful monster the effluvium\r\nof the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for\r\nkings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it\r\nthat it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its\r\nantidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which\r\nis easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel\r\ndestroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of\r\nnature against its own self.[1732]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (22.)—WOLVES; THE ORIGIN OF THE STORY OF VERSIPELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Italy also it is believed that there is a noxious influence in\r\nthe eye of a wolf; it is supposed that it will instantly take away\r\nthe voice of a man,[1733] if it is the first to see him. Africa and\r\nEgypt produce wolves of a sluggish and stunted nature;[1734] those\r\nof the colder climates are fierce and savage. That men have been\r\nturned into wolves, and again restored to their original form,[1735]\r\nwe must confidently look upon as untrue, unless, indeed, we are\r\nready to believe all the tales, which, for so many ages, have been\r\nfound to be fabulous. But, as the belief of it has become so firmly\r\nfixed in the minds of the common people, as to have caused the term\r\n“Versipellis”[1736] to be used as a common form of imprecation, I\r\nwill here point out its origin. Euanthes, a Grecian author of no mean\r\nreputation, informs us that the Arcadians assert that a member of the\r\nfamily of one Anthus is chosen by lot, and then taken to a certain\r\nlake in that district, where, after suspending his clothes on an\r\noak, he swims across the water and goes away into the desert, where\r\nhe is changed into a wolf and associates with other animals of the\r\nsame species for a space of nine years. If he has kept himself from\r\nbeholding a man during the whole of that time, he returns to the same\r\nlake, and, after swimming across it, resumes his original form, only\r\nwith the addition of nine years in age to his former appearance. To\r\nthis Fabius[1737] adds, that he takes his former clothes as well. It is\r\nreally wonderful to what a length the credulity[1738] of the Greeks\r\nwill go! There is no falsehood, if ever so barefaced, to which some of\r\nthem cannot be found to bear testimony.\r\n\r\nSo too, Agriopas, who wrote the Olympionics,[1739] informs us that\r\nDemænetus, the Parrhasian, during a sacrifice of human victims, which\r\nthe Arcadians were offering up to the Lycæan[1740] Jupiter, tasted the\r\nentrails of a boy who had been slaughtered; upon which he was turned\r\ninto a wolf, but, ten years afterwards, was restored to his original\r\nshape and his calling of an athlete, and returned victorious in the\r\npugilistic contests at the Olympic games.\r\n\r\nIt is also commonly supposed, that the tail of this animal contains a\r\nsmall lock of hair, which possesses an amatory power; and that when\r\nthe creature is caught, this hair is shed by it, but has no virtue\r\nwhatever, unless it is procured from the animal while alive.[1741] It\r\nis said that these animals couple for no more than twelve days in the\r\nyear;[1742] and that when pressed by hunger they will eat earth. Among\r\nthe points of augury, to have our progress cut short to the right by\r\na wolf, if at the time its mouth is full, is the best of omens. There\r\nis a species, which is known as the stag-wolf, such as we have already\r\nsaid[1743] were brought from Gaul and exhibited in the Circus by\r\nPompeius Magnus. It is said, that however hungry this animal may chance\r\nto be, if it only turns its head while eating, it immediately becomes\r\noblivious of the food that is before it, and takes its departure to\r\nseek it elsewhere.[1744]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (23.)—DIFFERENT KINDS OF SERPENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to serpents, it is generally known, that they\r\nassume the colour of the soil in which they conceal themselves. The\r\ndifferent species of them are innumerable. The cerastes[1745] has\r\nlittle horns, often four in number, projecting from the body, by the\r\nmovement of which it attracts birds, while the rest of its body lies\r\nconcealed.[1746] The amphisbæna[1747] has two heads,[1748] that is to\r\nsay, it has a second one at the tail, as though one mouth were too\r\nlittle for the discharge of all its venom. Some serpents have scales,\r\nsome a mottled skin, and they are all possessed of a deadly poison. The\r\njaculus[1749] darts from the branches of trees; and it is not only to\r\nour feet that the serpent is formidable, for these fly through the air\r\neven, just as though they were hurled from an engine.[1750] The neck of\r\nthe asp[1751] puffs out,[1752] and there is no remedy whatever against\r\nits sting, except the instant excision of the affected part.[1753]\r\nThis reptile, which is thus deadly, is possessed of this one sense,\r\nor rather affection; the male and the female are generally found\r\ntogether,[1754] and the one cannot live without the other; hence it is\r\nthat, if one of them happens to be killed, the other takes incredible\r\npains to avenge its death. It follows the slayer of its mate, and will\r\nsingle him out among ever such a large number of people, by a sort of\r\ninstinctive knowledge; with this object it overcomes all difficulties,\r\ntravels any distance, and is only to be avoided by the intervention\r\nof rivers or an accelerated flight. It is really difficult to decide,\r\nwhether Nature has altogether been more liberal of good or of evil.\r\nFirst of all, however, she has given to this pest but weak powers of\r\nsight, and has placed the eyes, not in the front of the head, so that\r\nit may see straight before it, but in the temples, so that it is more\r\nfrequently put in motion by the approach of the footstep than through\r\nthe sight. (24.) The ichneumon, too, is its enemy[1755] to the very\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—THE ICHNEUMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hostility is the especial glory of this animal, which is also\r\nproduced in Egypt. It plunges itself repeatedly into the mud, and then\r\ndries itself in the sun: as soon as, by these means, it has armed\r\nitself with a sufficient number of coatings, it proceeds to the combat.\r\nRaising its tail, and turning its back to the serpent, it receives its\r\nstings, which are inflicted to no purpose, until at last, turning its\r\nhead sideways, and viewing its enemy, it seizes it by the throat. Not\r\ncontent, however, with this victory, it conquers another creature also,\r\nwhich is no less dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (25.)—THE CROCODILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nile produces the crocodile also,[1756] a destructive quadruped,\r\nand equally dangerous on land and in the water. This is the only land\r\nanimal that does not enjoy the use of its tongue,[1757] and the only\r\none that has the upper jaw moveable, and is capable of biting with\r\nit; and terrible is its bite, for the rows of its teeth fit into each\r\nother, like those of a comb.[1758] Its length mostly exceeds eighteen\r\ncubits. It produces eggs about the size of those of the goose, and, by\r\na kind of instinctive foresight, always deposits them beyond the limit\r\nto which the river Nile rises, when at its greatest height.[1759] There\r\nis no animal that arrives at so great a bulk as this, from so small a\r\nbeginning.[1760] It is armed also with claws, and has a skin, that\r\nis proof against all blows. It passes the day on land, and the night\r\nin the water, in both instances on account of the warmth.[1761] When\r\nit has glutted itself with fish, it goes to sleep on the banks of the\r\nriver, a portion of the food always remaining in its mouth; upon which,\r\na little bird, which in Egypt is known as the trochilus, and, in Italy,\r\nas the king of the birds, for the purpose of obtaining food, invites\r\nthe crocodile to open its jaws; then, hopping to and fro, it first\r\ncleans the outside of its mouth, next the teeth, and then the inside,\r\nwhile the animal opens its jaws as wide as possible, in consequence of\r\nthe pleasure which it experiences from the titillation.[1762] It is at\r\nthese moments that the ichneumon, seeing it fast asleep in consequence\r\nof the agreeable sensation thus produced, darts down its throat like an\r\narrow, and eats away its intestines.[1763]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—THE SCINCUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the crocodile, but smaller even than the ichneumon, is the\r\nscincus,[1764] which is also produced in the Nile, and the flesh of\r\nwhich is the most effectual antidote against poisons, and acts as a\r\npowerful aphrodisiac upon the male sex. But so great a pest was the\r\ncrocodile to prove, that Nature was not content with giving it one\r\nenemy only; the dolphins, therefore, which enter the Nile, have the\r\nback armed with a spine,[1765] which is edged like a knife, as if for\r\nthis very purpose; and although these animals are much inferior in\r\nstrength, they contrive to destroy the crocodile by artifice, which on\r\nthe other hand attempts to drive them from their prey, and would reign\r\nalone in its river as its peculiar domain. For all animals have an\r\nespecial instinct in this respect, and are able to know not only what\r\nis for their own advantage, but also what is to the disadvantage of\r\ntheir enemies; they fully understand the use of their own weapons, they\r\nknow their opportunity, and the weak parts of those with which they\r\nhave to contend.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the belly of the crocodile is soft and thin; aware of this,\r\nthe dolphins plunge into the water, as if in great alarm, and diving\r\nbeneath its belly, tear it open with their spines. There is a race of\r\nmen also, who are peculiarly hostile to this animal; they are known as\r\nthe Tentyritæ, from an island in the Nile which they inhabit.[1766]\r\nThese men are of small stature, but of wonderful presence of mind,\r\nthough for this particular object only. The crocodile is a terrible\r\nanimal to those who fly from it, while at the same time it will fly\r\nfrom those who pursue it; these, however, are the only people who dare\r\nto attack it. They even swim in the river after it, and mount its back\r\nlike so many horsemen; and just as the animal turns up its head for\r\nthe purpose of biting them, they insert a club into its mouth, holding\r\nwhich at each end, with the two hands, it acts like a bit, and by these\r\nmeans they drive the captured animal on shore. They also terrify the\r\ncrocodile so much by their voice alone even, as to force it to disgorge\r\nthe bodies which it has lately swallowed, for the purpose of burial.\r\nThis island, therefore, is the only place near which the crocodile\r\nnever swims; indeed, it is repelled by the odour of this race of men,\r\njust as serpents are by that of the Psylli.[1767] The sight of this\r\nanimal is said to be dull when it is in the water, but, when out of the\r\nwater, piercing in the extreme; it always passes the four winter months\r\nin a cave, without taking food.[1768] Some persons say, that this is\r\nthe only animal that continues to increase in size as long as it lives;\r\nit is very long-lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nile produces the hippopotamus, another wild beast, of a still\r\ngreater size. It has the cloven hoof of the ox; the back, the mane, and\r\nthe neighing of the horse; and the turned-up snout, the tail, and the\r\nhooked teeth of the wild boar, but not so dangerous.[1769] The hide\r\nis impenetrable, except when it has been soaked with water; and it is\r\nused for making shields and helmets.[1770] This animal lays waste the\r\nstanding corn, and determines beforehand what part it shall ravage on\r\nthe following day; it is said also, that it enters the field backwards,\r\nto prevent any ambush being laid for it on its return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40. (26.)—WHO FIRST EXHIBITED THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AND THE CROCODILE\r\nAT ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Scaurus was the first who exhibited this animal at Rome, together\r\nwith five crocodiles, at the games which he gave in his ædileship, in\r\na piece of water[1771] which had been temporarily prepared for the\r\npurpose. The hippopotamus has even been our instructor in one of the\r\noperations of medicine.[1772] When the animal has become too bulky by\r\ncontinued over-feeding, it goes down to the banks of the river, and\r\nexamines the reeds which have been newly cut; as soon as it has found a\r\nstump that is very sharp, it presses its body against it, and so wounds\r\none of the veins in the thigh; and, by the flow of blood thus produced,\r\nthe body, which would otherwise have fallen into a morbid state, is\r\nrelieved; after which, it covers up the wound with mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (27.)—THE MEDICINAL REMEDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM\r\nANIMALS.[1773]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bird also, which is called the ibis,[1774] a native of the same\r\ncountry of Egypt, has shewn us some things of a similar nature. By\r\nmeans of its hooked beak, it laves the body through that part, by which\r\nit is especially necessary for health that the residuous food should be\r\ndischarged. Nor, indeed, are these the only inventions which have been\r\nborrowed from animals, to prove of use to man. The power of the herb\r\ndittany, in extracting arrows, was first disclosed to us by stags that\r\nhad been struck by that weapon; the weapon being discharged on their\r\nfeeding upon this plant.[1775] The same animals, too, when they happen\r\nto have been wounded by the phalangium, a species of spider, or by any\r\ninsect of a similar nature, cure themselves by eating crabs. One of\r\nthe very best remedies for the bite of the serpent, is the plant[1776]\r\nwith which lizards treat their wounds when injured in fighting with\r\neach other. The swallow has shown us that the chelidonia[1777] is very\r\nserviceable to the sight, by the fact of its employing it for the cure\r\nof its young, when their eyes are affected. The tortoise recruits its\r\npowers of effectually resisting serpents, by eating the plant which\r\nis known as cunile bubula;[1778] and the weasel feeds on rue, when it\r\nfights with the serpent in the pursuit of mice.[1779] The stork cures\r\nitself of its diseases with wild marjoram, and the wild boar with ivy,\r\nas also by eating crabs, and more particularly those that have been\r\nthrown up by the sea.[1780] The snake, when the membrane which covers\r\nits body has been contracted by the cold of winter, throws it off in\r\nthe spring by the aid of the juices of fennel,[1781] and thus becomes\r\nsleek and youthful in appearance. First of all, it disengages the head,\r\nand it then takes no less than a day and a night in working itself out,\r\nand divesting itself of the membrane in which it has been enclosed.\r\nThe same animal, too, on finding its sight weakened during its winter\r\nretreat, anoints and refreshes its eyes by rubbing itself on the plant\r\ncalled fennel or marathrum; but if any of the scales are slow in coming\r\noff,[1782] it rubs itself against the thorns of the juniper. The dragon\r\nrelieves the nausea which affects it in spring, with the juices of the\r\nlettuce.[1783] The barbarous nations go to hunt the panther, provided\r\nwith meat that has been rubbed with aconite, which is a poison.[1784]\r\nImmediately on eating it, compression of the throat overtakes them,\r\nfrom which circumstance it is, that the plant has received the name of\r\npardalianches.[1785] The animal, however, has found an antidote against\r\nthis poison in human excrements; besides which, it is so eager to get\r\nat them, that the shepherds purposely suspend them in a vessel, placed\r\nso high, that the animal cannot reach them even by leaping, when it\r\nendeavours to get at them; accordingly, it continues to leap until\r\nit has quite exhausted itself, and at last expires: otherwise, it is\r\nso tenacious of life, that it will continue to fight long after its\r\nintestines have been dragged out of its body.\r\n\r\nWhen an elephant has happened to devour a chameleon, which is of the\r\nsame colour with the herbage, it counteracts this poison by means\r\nof the wild olive. Bears, when they have eaten of the fruit of the\r\nmandrake, lick up numbers of ants.[1786] The stag counteracts the\r\neffect of poisonous plants by eating the artichoke. Wood-pigeons,\r\njackdaws, blackbirds, and partridges, purge themselves once a year\r\nby eating bay leaves; pigeons, turtle-doves, and poultry, with\r\nwall-pellitory, or helxine; ducks, geese, and other aquatic birds, with\r\nthe plant sideritis or vervain; cranes, and birds of a similar nature,\r\nwith the bulrush. The raven, when it has killed a chameleon, a contest\r\nin which even the conqueror suffers, counteracts the poison by means of\r\nlaurel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42. (28.)—PROGNOSTICS OF DANGER DERIVED FROM ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a thousand other facts of this kind: and the same Nature\r\nhas also bestowed upon many animals as well, the faculty of observing\r\nthe heavens, and of presaging the winds, rains, and tempests, each\r\nin its own peculiar way. It would be an endless labour to enumerate\r\nthem all; just as much as it would be to point out the relation of\r\neach to man.[1787] For, in fact, they warn us of danger, not only by\r\ntheir fibres and their entrails, to which a large portion of mankind\r\nattach the greatest faith, but by other kinds of warnings as well.\r\nWhen a building is about to fall down, all the mice desert it[1788]\r\nbefore-hand, and the spiders with their webs are the first to drop.\r\nDivination from birds has been made a science among the Romans, and the\r\ncollege of its priests is looked upon as peculiarly sacred.[1789] In\r\nThrace, when all parts are covered with ice, the foxes are consulted,\r\nan animal which, in other respects, is baneful from its craftiness. It\r\nhas been observed, that this animal applies its ear to the ice, for the\r\npurpose of testing its thickness; hence it is, that the inhabitants\r\nwill never cross frozen rivers and lakes until the foxes have passed\r\nover them and returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43. (29.)—NATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EXTERMINATED BY ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have accounts, too, no less remarkable, in reference even to the\r\nmost contemptible of animals. M. Varro informs us, that a town in\r\nSpain was undermined by rabbits, and one in Thessaly, by mice; that\r\nthe inhabitants of a district in Gaul were driven from their country\r\nby frogs,[1790] and a place in Africa by locusts;[1791] that the\r\ninhabitants of Gyarus,[1792] one of the Cyclades, were driven away\r\nby mice;[1793] and the Amunclæ, in Italy, by serpents. There is a\r\nvast desert tract on this side of the Æthiopian Cynamolgi,[1794] the\r\ninhabitants of which were exterminated by scorpions and venomous\r\nants.[1795] and Theophrastus informs us, that the people of\r\nRhœteum[1796] were driven away by scolopendræ.[1797] But we must now\r\nreturn to the other kinds of wild beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44. (30.)—THE HYÆNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the vulgar notion, that the hyæna possesses in itself both\r\nsexes, being a male during one year, and a female the next, and that\r\nit becomes pregnant without the co-operation: of the male; Aristotle,\r\nhowever, denies this.[1798] The neck, with the mane, runs continuously\r\ninto the back-bone, so that the animal cannot bend this part without\r\nturning round the whole body. Many other wonderful things are also\r\nrelated of this animal; and strangest of all, that it imitates the\r\nhuman voice among the stalls of the shepherds; and while there, learns\r\nthe name of some one of them, and then calls him away, and devours him.\r\nIt is said also, that it can imitate a man vomiting, and that, in this\r\nway, it attracts the dogs, and then falls upon them. It is the only\r\nanimal that digs up graves, in order to obtain the bodies of the dead.\r\nThe female is rarely caught: its eyes, it is said, are of a thousand\r\nvarious colours and changes of shade. It is said also, that on coming\r\nin contact with its shadow, dogs will lose their voice, and that, by\r\ncertain magical influences, it can render any animal immoveable, round\r\nwhich it has walked three times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—THE COROCOTTA; THE MANTICHORA.[1799]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the union of the hyæna with the Æthiopian lioness, the corocotta\r\nis produced, which has the same faculty of imitating the voices of\r\nmen and cattle. Its gaze is always fixed and immoveable; it has no\r\ngums in either of its jaws, and the teeth are one continuous piece of\r\nbone; they are enclosed in a sort of box as it were, that they may not\r\nbe blunted by rubbing against each other. Juba informs us, that the\r\nmantichora of Æthiopia can also imitate the human speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—WILD ASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of hyænas are produced in Africa, which also gives birth\r\nto multitudes of wild asses. In this species each male rules over a\r\nherd of females. Fearing rivals in their lust, they carefully watch\r\nthe pregnant females, and castrate the young males with their teeth,\r\nas soon as they are born.[1800] The pregnant females, on the other\r\nhand, seek concealment, and endeavour to bring forth in secret, being\r\ndesirous to increase their opportunities of sexual indulgence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—BEAVERS, AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS;[1801] OTTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beavers of the Euxine, when they are closely pressed by danger,\r\nthemselves cut off the same part, as they know that it is for this\r\nthat they are pursued. This substance is called castoreum by the\r\nphysicians.[1802] In addition to this, the bite of this animal is\r\nterrible; with its teeth it can cut down trees on the banks of rivers,\r\njust as though with a knife.[1803] If they seize a man by any part of\r\nhis body, they will never loose their hold until his bones are broken\r\nand crackle under their teeth. The tail is like that of a fish;[1804]\r\nin the other parts of the body they resemble the otter;[1805] they are\r\nboth of them aquatic animals, and both have hair softer than down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48. (31.)—BRAMBLE-FROGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBramble-frogs,[1806] also, which live both on land and in water, are\r\nreplete with various medicinal substances, which they are said to\r\ndischarge each day, and to take in again with their food, of which they\r\nonly retain the poisonous parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—THE SEA-CALF; BEAVERS; LIZARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea-calf, too, lives equally in the sea and on land, being\r\npossessed of the same degree of intelligence as the beaver. It vomits\r\nforth its gall, which is useful for many purposes in medicine; also\r\nthe rennet,[1807] which serves as a remedy in epilepsy; for it is well\r\naware that it is hunted for these substances. Theophrastus informs\r\nus, that lizards[1808] also cast their skins like the serpent, and\r\ninstantly devour them, thus depriving us of a powerful remedy for\r\nepilepsy; he says, too, that the bite of the lizard is fatal in Greece,\r\nbut harmless in Italy.[1809]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50. (32.)—STAGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStags, although the most mild of all animals, have still their own\r\nfeelings of malignancy;[1810] when hard pressed by the hounds, of\r\ntheir own accord they fly for refuge to man; and when the females\r\nbring forth, they are less anxious to avoid the paths which bear\r\ntraces of human footsteps, than solitary spots which offer a retreat\r\nto wild beasts.[1811] They become pregnant after the rising of the\r\nconstellation Arcturus;[1812] they bring forth after a gestation of\r\neight months, and sometimes produce two young ones. They separate\r\nafter conception, but the males, upon being thus abandoned, become\r\nmaddened with the fury of their passion; they dig up the earth, and\r\ntheir muzzles become quite black, until they have been washed by the\r\nrain.[1813] The females, before they bring forth, purge themselves by\r\nmeans of a certain herb, which is called seselis, by the use of which\r\nparturition is rendered more easy. After delivery, they take a mixture\r\nof the two plants called seselis[1814] and aros,[1815] and then return\r\nto the fawn; they seem desirous, for some reason or other, that\r\ntheir first milk, after parturition, should be impregnated with the\r\njuice of these plants. They then exercise the young ones in running,\r\nand teach them how to take to flight, leading them to precipices,\r\nand showing them how to leap. The sexual passion of the male having\r\nbeen now satisfied, he repairs to the pasture lands with the greatest\r\neagerness. When they feel themselves becoming too fat, they seek some\r\nretired spot, thus acknowledging the inconvenience arising from their\r\nbulk. Besides this, they continually pause in their flight, stand\r\nstill and look back, and then again resume their flight when the enemy\r\napproaches. This pause is occasioned by the intense pain which they\r\nfeel in the intestines, a part which is so weak, that a very slight\r\nblow will cause them to break within. The barking of a dog instantly\r\nputs them to flight, and they always run with the wind, in order that\r\nno trace of them may be left. They are soothed by the shepherd’s pipe\r\nand his song;[1816] when their ears are erect, their sense of hearing\r\nis very acute, but when dropped, they become deaf.[1817]\r\n\r\nIn other respects the stag is a simple animal, which regards every\r\nthing as wonderful, and with a stupid astonishment; so much so, indeed,\r\nthat if a horse or cow happens to approach it, it will not see the\r\nhunter, who may be close at hand, or, if it does see him, it only gazes\r\nupon his bow and arrow. Stags cross the sea in herds, swimming in a\r\nlong line, the head of each resting on the haunches of the one that\r\nprecedes it, each in its turn falling back to the rear. This has been\r\nparticularly remarked when they pass over from Cilicia to the island\r\nof Cyprus. Though they do not see the land, they still are able to\r\ndirect themselves by the smell. The males have horns, and are the only\r\nanimals that shed them every year, at a stated time in the spring; at\r\nwhich period they seek out with the greatest care the most retired\r\nplaces, and after losing them, remain concealed, as though aware that\r\nthey are unarmed. Still, however, they envy us the good that these\r\nmight do us; for it is said the right horn, which possesses, as it\r\nwere, certain medicinal properties, can never be found, a circumstance\r\nthe more astonishing, from the fact that they change their horns every\r\nyear, even when kept in parks;[1818] it is generally thought that they\r\nbury their horns in the ground. The odour of either horn, when burnt,\r\ndrives away serpents and detects epilepsy. They also bear the marks\r\nof their age on the horns, every year, up to the sixth,[1819] a fresh\r\nantler being added; after which period the horns are renewed in the\r\nsame state, so that by means of them their age cannot be ascertained.\r\nTheir old age, however, is indicated by their teeth, for then they have\r\nonly a few, or none at all; and we then no longer perceive, at the base\r\nof their horns, antlers projecting from the front of the forehead, as\r\nis usually the case with the animal when young.\r\n\r\nWhen this animal is castrated it does not shed its horns, nor are they\r\nreproduced. When the horns begin to be reproduced, two projections are\r\nto be seen, much resembling, at first, dry skin; they grow with tender\r\nshoots, having upon them a soft down like that on the head of a reed.\r\nSo long as they are without horns, they go to feed during the night.\r\nAs the horns grow, they harden by the heat of the sun, and the animal,\r\nfrom time to time, tries their strength upon the trees; when satisfied\r\nwith their strength, it leaves its retreat.\r\n\r\nStags, too, have been occasionally caught with ivy green and growing on\r\ntheir horns,[1820] the plant having taken root on them, as it would on\r\nany piece of wood, while the animal was rubbing them against the trees.\r\nThe stag is sometimes found white, as is said to have been the case\r\nwith the hind of Q. Sertorius, which he persuaded the nations of Spain\r\nto look upon as having the gift of prophecy.[1821] The stag, too,\r\nfights with the serpent: it traces out the serpent’s hole, and draws\r\nit forth by the breath of its nostrils,[1822] and hence it is that the\r\nsmell of burnt stags’ horn has the remarkable power of driving away\r\nserpents. The very best remedy for the bite of a serpent is the rennet\r\nof a fawn that has been killed in the womb of its mother.\r\n\r\nThe stag is generally admitted to be very long lived; some were\r\ncaptured at the end of one hundred years with the golden collars which\r\nAlexander the Great had put upon them, and which were quite concealed\r\nby the folds of the skin, in consequence of the accumulation of\r\nfat.[1823] This animal is not subject to fever, and, indeed, it is a\r\npreservative against that complaint. We know that of late some women of\r\nprincely rank have been in the habit of eating the flesh of the stag\r\nevery morning, and that they have arrived at an extreme old age, free\r\nfrom all fevers. It is, however, generally supposed that the animal\r\nmust be killed by a single wound to make sure of it possessing this\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\n(33.) Of the same species is an animal, which only differs from the\r\nstag in having a beard and long hair about the shoulders: it is called\r\ntragelaphus,[1824] and is produced nowhere except on the banks of the\r\nPhasis.[1825]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—THE CHAMELEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica is almost the only country that does not produce[1826] the\r\nstag, but then it produces the chameleon,[1827] although it is much\r\nmore commonly met with in India. Its figure and size are that of a\r\nlizard, only that its legs are straight and longer. Its sides unite\r\nunder its belly, as in fishes, and its spine projects in a similar\r\nmanner. Its muzzle is not unlike the snout of a small hog, so far as\r\nin so small an animal it can be. Its tail is very long, and becomes\r\nsmaller towards the end, coiling up in folds like that of the viper.\r\nIt has hooked claws, and a slow movement like that of the tortoise;\r\nits body is rough like that of the crocodile; its eyes are deep sunk\r\nin the orbits, placed very near each other, very large, and of the\r\nsame colour as the body. It never closes them, and when the animal\r\nlooks round, it does so, not by the motion of the pupil, but of the\r\nwhite of the eye.[1828] It always holds the head upright and the mouth\r\nopen, and is the only animal which receives nourishment neither by meat\r\nnor drink, nor anything else, but from the air alone.[1829] Towards\r\nthe end of the dog-days[1830] it is fierce, but at other times quite\r\nharmless. The nature of its colour, too, is very remarkable, for it is\r\ncontinually changing; its eyes, its tail, and its whole body always\r\nassuming the colour of whatever object is nearest, with the exception\r\nof white and red.[1831] After death, it becomes of a pale colour. It\r\nhas a little flesh about the head, the jaws, and the root of the tail,\r\nbut none whatever on the rest of the body. It has no blood whatever,\r\nexcept in the heart and about the eyes, and its entrails are without a\r\nspleen.[1832] It conceals itself during the winter months, just like\r\nthe lizard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—OTHER ANIMALS WHICH CHANGE COLOUR; THE TARANDUS, THE LYCAON,\r\nAND THE THOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tarandrus,[1833] too, of the Scythians, changes its colour, but\r\nthis is the case with none of the animals which are covered with hair,\r\nexcept the lycaon[1834] of India, which is said to have a mane on the\r\nneck. But with respect to the thos,[1835] (which is a species of wolf,\r\ndiffering from the common kind in having a larger body and very short\r\nlegs, leaping with great activity, living by the chase, and never\r\nattacking man); it changes its coat, and not its colour, for it is\r\ncovered with hair in the winter, and goes bare in summer. The tarandrus\r\nis of the size of the ox; its head is larger than that of the stag, and\r\nnot very unlike it; its horns are branched, its hoofs cloven, and its\r\nhair as long as that of the bear. Its proper colour, when it thinks\r\nproper to return to it, is like that of the ass. Its hide is of such\r\nextreme hardness, that it is used for making breast-plates. When it is\r\nfrightened, this animal reflects the colour of all the trees, shrubs,\r\nand flowers, or of the spots in which it is concealed; hence it is that\r\nit is so rarely captured. It is wonderful that such various hues should\r\nbe given to the body, but still more so that it should be given to the\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53. (35.)—THE PORCUPINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia and Africa produce the porcupine, the body of which is covered\r\nwith prickles. It is a species of hedgehog, but the quills of the\r\nporcupine are longer, and when it stretches the skin, it discharges\r\nthem like so many missiles. With these it pierces the mouths of the\r\ndogs which are pressing hard upon it, and even sends its darts to some\r\ndistance further.[1836] It conceals itself during the winter months,\r\nwhich, indeed, is the nature of many animals, and more especially the\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54. (36.)—BEARS AND THEIR CUBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBears couple in the beginning of winter,[1837] and not after the\r\nfashion of other quadrupeds; for both animals lie down and embrace each\r\nother.[1838] The female then retires by herself to a separate den,\r\nand there brings forth on the thirtieth day, mostly five young ones.\r\nWhen first born, they are shapeless masses of white flesh, a little\r\nlarger than mice;[1839] their claws alone being prominent. The mother\r\nthen licks them gradually into proper shape. There is nothing more\r\nuncommon than to see a she-bear in the act of parturition.[1840] The\r\nmale remains in his retreat for forty days, the female four months.\r\nIf they happen to have no den, they construct a retreat with branches\r\nand shrubs, which is made impenetrable to the rain and is lined with\r\nsoft leaves. During the first fourteen days they are overcome by so\r\ndeep a sleep, that they cannot be aroused by wounds even. They become\r\nwonderfully fat, too, while in this lethargic state. This fat is much\r\nused in medicine; and it is very useful in preventing the hair from\r\nfalling off.[1841] At the end of these fourteen days they sit up, and\r\nfind nourishment by sucking their fore-paws.[1842] They warm their\r\ncubs, when cold, by pressing them to the breast, not unlike the way\r\nin which birds brood over their eggs. It is a very astonishing thing,\r\nbut Theophrastus believes it, that if we preserve the flesh of the\r\nbear, the animal being killed in its dormant state, it will increase in\r\nbulk, even though it may have been cooked.[1843] During this period no\r\nsigns of food are to be found in the stomach of the animal, and only\r\na very slight quantity of liquid; there are a few drops of blood only\r\nnear the heart, but none whatever in any other part of the body.[1844]\r\nThey leave their retreat in the spring, the males being remarkably\r\nfat: of this circumstance, however, we cannot give any satisfactory\r\nexplanation, for the sleep, during which they increase so much in bulk,\r\nlasts, as we have already stated, only fourteen days.[1845] When they\r\ncome out, they eat a certain plant, which is known as aros,[1846] in\r\norder to relax the bowels, which would otherwise become in a state of\r\nconstipation; and they sharpen the edges of their teeth against the\r\nyoung shoots of the trees. Their eye-sight is dull, for which reason\r\nin especial, they seek the combs of bees, in order that from the bees\r\nstinging them in the throat and drawing blood, the oppression in the\r\nhead may be relieved.[1847] The head of the bear is extremely weak,\r\nwhereas, in the lion, it is remarkable for its strength: on which\r\naccount it is, that when the bear, impelled by any alarm, is about to\r\nprecipitate itself from a rock, it covers its head with its paws. In\r\nthe arena of the Circus they are often to be seen killed by a blow on\r\nthe head with the fist. The people of Spain have a belief, that there\r\nis some kind of magical poison in the brain of the bear, and therefore\r\nburn the heads of those that have been killed in their public games;\r\nfor it is averred, that the brain, when mixed with drink, produces\r\nin man the rage of the bear.[1848] These animals walk on two feet,\r\nand climb down trees backwards.[1849] They can overcome the bull, by\r\nsuspending themselves, by all four legs, from its muzzle and horns,\r\nthus wearing out its powers by their weight. In no other animal is\r\nstupidity found more adroit in devising mischief. It is recorded in our\r\nAnnals, that on the fourteenth day before the calends of October,[1850]\r\nin the consulship of M. Piso and M. Messala, Domitius Ahenobarbus, the\r\ncurule ædile, brought into the Circus one hundred Numidian bears, and\r\nas many Æthiopian hunters. I am surprised to find the word Numidian\r\nadded, seeing that it is well known that there are no bears produced in\r\nAfrica.[1851]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55. (37.)—THE MICE OF PONTUS AND OF THE ALPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mice of Pontus also conceal themselves during the winter; but only\r\nthe white ones.[1852] I wonder how those authors, who have asserted\r\nthat the sense of taste in these animals is very acute, found out\r\nthat such is the fact. The Alpine mice, which are the same size as\r\nbadgers, also conceal themselves;[1853] but they first carry a store\r\nof provisions into their retreat. Some writers, indeed, say that the\r\nmale and female, lying on their backs alternately, hold in their paws a\r\nbundle of gnawed herbs, and, the tail of each in its turn being seized\r\nby the teeth of the other, in this way, they are dragged into their\r\nhole; hence it is, that at this season their hair is found to be rubbed\r\noff their backs. There is a similar animal also in Egypt,[1854] which\r\nsits, in the same way, upon its haunches, and walks on two feet, using\r\nthe fore feet as hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—HEDGEHOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHedgehogs also lay up food for the winter; rolling themselves on\r\napples as they lie on the ground, they pierce one with their quills,\r\nand then take up another in the mouth, and so carry them into the\r\nhollows of trees. These animals also, when they conceal themselves\r\nin their holes, afford a sure sign that the wind is about to change\r\nfrom north-east to south.[1855] When they perceive the approach of\r\nthe hunter, they draw in the head and feet, and all the lower part of\r\nthe body, which is covered by a thin and defenceless down only, and\r\nthen roll themselves up into the form of a ball, so that there is no\r\nway of taking hold of them but by their quills. When they are reduced\r\nto a state of desperation, they discharge a corrosive urine, which\r\ninjures their skin and quills, as they are aware that it is for the\r\nsake of them that they are hunted. A skilful hunter, therefore, will\r\nonly pursue them when they have just discharged their urine. In this\r\ncase the skin retains its value; while in the other case, it becomes\r\nspoilt and easily torn, the quills rotting and falling off, even though\r\nthe animal should escape with its life. For this reason it is that it\r\nnever moistens itself with this poisonous fluid, except when reduced to\r\nthe last stage of desperation; for it has a perfect hatred for its own\r\nvenomous distillation, and so careful is the animal, so determined to\r\nwait till the very last moment, that it is generally caught before it\r\nhas employed this means of defence.\r\n\r\nThey force it to unroll itself, by sprinkling warm water upon it, and\r\nthen, suspended by one of its hind legs, it is left to die of hunger;\r\nfor there is no other mode of destroying it, without doing injury\r\nto its skin. This animal is not, as many of us imagine, entirely\r\nuseless to man. If it were not for the quills which it produces, the\r\nsoft fleece of the sheep would have been given in vain to mankind;\r\nfor it is by means of its skin, that our woollen cloth is dressed.\r\nFrom the monopoly of this article, great frauds and great profits\r\nhave resulted;[1856] there is no subject on which the senate has more\r\nfrequently passed decrees, and there is not one of the Emperors, who\r\nhas not received from the provinces complaints respecting it.[1857]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (38.)—THE LEONTOPHONUS, AND THE LYNX.[1858]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also two other animals, whose urine possesses very wonderful\r\nproperties. We have heard speak of a small animal, to which the name of\r\nleontophonus[1859] has been given, and which is said to exist only in\r\nthose countries where the lion is produced; if its flesh is only tasted\r\nby the lion, so intensely venomous is its nature, that this lord of\r\nthe other quadrupeds instantly expires. Hence it is, that the hunters\r\nof the lion burn its body to ashes, and sprinkle a piece of flesh with\r\nthe powder, and so kill the lion by means of the ashes even—so fatal to\r\nit is this poison! The lion, therefore, not without good reason hates\r\nthe leontophonus, and after destroying its sight, kills it without\r\ninflicting a bite: the animal, on the other hand, sprinkles the lion\r\nwith its urine, being well aware that this too is fatal to it.\r\n\r\nThe urine of the lynx, in the countries[1860] where that animal is\r\nproduced, either becomes crystallized, or else hardens into a precious\r\nstone, resembling the carbuncle, and which shines like fire.[1861] This\r\nis called lyncurium;[1862] and hence it is, that many persons believe\r\nthat this is the way in which amber is produced. The lynx, being well\r\naware of this property, envies us the possession of its urine, and\r\ntherefore buries it in the earth;[1863] by this, however, it becomes\r\nsolid all the sooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—BADGERS AND SQUIRRELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe badger, when alarmed, shows its fear by a different kind of\r\nartifice; inflating the skin, it distends it to such a degree, as\r\nto repel equally the blows of men and the bite of dogs.[1864] The\r\nsquirrel, also, has the power of foreseeing storms, and so, stopping\r\nup its hole at the side from which the wind blows, it leaves the other\r\nside open; besides which, the tail, which is furnished with longer hair\r\nthan the rest of the body, serves as a covering for it. It appears,\r\ntherefore,[1865] that some animals lay up a store of food for the\r\nwinter, while others pass the time in sleep, which serves them instead\r\nof food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59. (39.)—VIPERS AND SNAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said, that the viper is the only one among the serpents that\r\nconceals itself in the earth; the others lurking either in the\r\nhollows of trees or in holes in the rocks.[1866] Provided they are\r\nnot destroyed by cold, they can live there, without taking food, for\r\na whole year.[1867] During the time that they are asleep in their\r\nretreat, none of them are venomous.\r\n\r\nA similar state of torpor exists also in snails. These animals again\r\nbecome dormant during the summer, adhering very powerfully to stones;\r\nand even, when turned up and pulled away from the stones, they will not\r\nleave their shells. In the Balearic isles, the snails which are known\r\nas the cave-snail,[1868] do not leave their holes in the ground, nor\r\ndo they feed upon any green thing, but adhere to each other like so\r\nmany grapes. There is another less common species also, which is closed\r\nby an operculum that adheres to the shell.[1869] These animals always\r\nburrow under the earth, and were formerly never found, except in the\r\nenvirons of the Maritime Alps: they have, however, of late been dug up\r\nin the territory of Liternum;[1870] the most valued, however, of all,\r\nare those of the island of Astypalæa.[1871]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60.—LIZARDS.[1872]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said, that the lizard, the greatest enemy of all to the snail,\r\nnever prolongs its life beyond six months. The lizards of Arabia are\r\na cubit in length,[1873] while those upon Nysa,[1874] a mountain of\r\nIndia, are twenty-four feet long, their colour being either yellow,\r\npurple, or azure blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAP. 61. (40.)—THE QUALITIES OF THE DOG; EXAMPLES OF ITS ATTACHMENT\r\n TO ITS MASTER; NATIONS WHICH HAVE KEPT DOGS FOR THE PURPOSES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the animals, also, that are domesticated with mankind, there are\r\nmany circumstances that are far from undeserving of being known: among\r\nthese, there are more particularly that most faithful friend of man,\r\nthe dog, and the horse. We have an account of a dog that fought against\r\na band of robbers, in defending its master; and although it was pierced\r\nwith wounds, still it would not leave the body, from which it drove\r\naway all birds and beasts. Another dog, again, in Epirus, recognized\r\nthe murderer of its master, in the midst of an assemblage of people,\r\nand, by biting and barking at him, extorted from him a confession of\r\nhis crime. A king of the Garamantes also was brought back from exile\r\nby two hundred dogs, which maintained the combat against all his\r\nopponents. The people of Colophon[1875] and Castabala[1876] kept troops\r\nof dogs, for the purposes of war; and these used to fight in the front\r\nrank, and never retreat; they were the most faithful of auxiliaries,\r\nand yet required no pay. After the defeat of the Cimbri, their dogs\r\ndefended their moveable houses, which were carried upon waggons. Jason,\r\nthe Lycian, having been slain, his dog refused to take food, and died\r\nof famine. A dog, to which Darius gives the name of Hyrcanus, upon the\r\nfuneral pile of King Lysimachus being lighted, threw itself into the\r\nflames,[1877] and the dog of King Hiero did the same. Philistus also\r\ngives a similar account of Pyrrhus, the dog of the tyrant Gelon: and\r\nit is said, also, that the dog of Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, tore\r\nConsingis,[1878] the wife of that king, in consequence of her wanton\r\nbehaviour, when toying with her husband.\r\n\r\nAmong ourselves, Volcatius, a man of rank, who instructed Cascellius in\r\nthe civil law,[1879] as he was riding on his Asturian jennet, towards\r\nevening, from his country-house, was attacked by a robber, and was only\r\nsaved by his dog. The senator Cælius,[1880] too, while lying sick at\r\nPlacentia, was surprised by armed men, but received not a wound from\r\nthem until they had first killed his dog. But a more extraordinary fact\r\nthan all, is what took place in our own times, and is testified by the\r\npublic register of the Roman people. In the consulship of Appius Junius\r\nand P. Silius, when Titius Sabinus[1881] was put to death, together\r\nwith his slaves, for the affair of Nero, the son of Germanicus, it was\r\nfound impossible to drive away a dog which belonged to one of them from\r\nthe prison; nor could it be forced away from the body, which had been\r\ncast down the Gemitorian steps;[1882] but there it stood howling, in\r\nthe presence of vast multitudes of people; and when some one threw a\r\npiece of bread to it, the animal carried it to the mouth of its master.\r\nAfterwards, when the body was thrown into the Tiber, the dog swam into\r\nthe river, and endeavoured to raise it out of the water; quite a throng\r\nof people being collected to witness this instance of an animal’s\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\nDogs are the only animals that are sure to know their masters; and if\r\nthey suddenly meet him as a stranger, they will instantly recognize\r\nhim. They are the only animals that will answer to their names, and\r\nrecognize the voices of the family. They recollect a road along which\r\nthey have passed, however long it may be. Next to man, there is no\r\nliving creature whose memory is so retentive. By sitting down on the\r\nground, we may arrest their most impetuous attack, even when prompted\r\nby the most violent rage.\r\n\r\nIn daily life we have discovered many other valuable qualities in this\r\nanimal; but its intelligence and sagacity are more especially shown\r\nin the chase. It discovers and traces out the tracks of the animal,\r\nleading by the leash[1883] the sportsman who accompanies it straight up\r\nto the prey; and as soon as ever it has perceived it, how silent it is,\r\nand how secret but significant is the indication which it gives, first\r\nby the tail and afterwards by the nose![1884] Hence it is, that even\r\nwhen worn out with old age, blind, and feeble, they are carried by the\r\nhuntsman in his arms, being still able to point out the coverts where\r\nthe game is concealed, by snuffing with their muzzles at the wind. The\r\nIndians raise a breed between the dog and the tiger,[1885] and for this\r\npurpose tie up the females in the forests when in heat. The first two\r\nlitters they look upon as too savage to be reared, but they bring up\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\nThe Gauls do the same with the wolf and the dog;[1886] and their packs\r\nof hounds have, each of them, one of these dogs, which acts as their\r\nguide and leader. This dog they follow in the chase, and him they\r\ncarefully obey; for these animals have even a notion of subordination\r\namong themselves. It is asserted that the dogs keep running when they\r\ndrink at the Nile, for fear of becoming a prey to the voracity of the\r\ncrocodile.[1887] When Alexander the Great was on his Indian expedition,\r\nhe was presented by the king of Albania with a dog of unusual size;\r\nbeing greatly delighted with its noble appearance, he ordered bears,\r\nand after them wild boars, and then deer, to be let loose before it;\r\nbut the dog lay down, and regarded them with a kind of immoveable\r\ncontempt. The noble spirit of the general became irritated by the\r\nsluggishness thus manifested by an animal of such vast bulk, and he\r\nordered it to be killed. The report of this reached the king, who\r\naccordingly sent another dog, and at the same time sent word that its\r\npowers were to be tried, not upon small animals, but upon the lion or\r\nthe elephant; adding, that he had had originally but two, and that\r\nif this one were put to death, the race would be extinct. Alexander,\r\nwithout delay, procured a lion, which in his presence was instantly\r\ntorn to pieces. He then ordered an elephant to be brought, and never\r\nwas he more delighted with any spectacle; for the dog, bristling up\r\nits hair all over the body, began by thundering forth a loud barking,\r\nand then attacked the animal, leaping at it first on one side and then\r\non the other, attacking it in the most skilful manner, and then again\r\nretreating at the opportune moment, until at last the elephant, being\r\nrendered quite giddy by turning round and round, fell to the earth, and\r\nmade it quite re-echo with his fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62.—THE GENERATION OF THE DOG.[1888]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis animal brings forth twice in the year; it is capable of bearing\r\nyoung when a year old, and gestation continues for sixty days. The\r\nyoung ones are born blind, and the greater the supply of nourishment\r\nfrom the mother’s milk, the more slowly do they acquire their sight;\r\nstill, however, this never takes place later than the twentieth day, or\r\nearlier than the seventh. It is said by some writers, that if only one\r\nis born, it is able to see on the ninth day; and that if there are two,\r\nthey begin to see on the tenth, every additional one causing the power\r\nof seeing to come a day later. It is said, too, that the females which\r\nare produced by the mother in her first litter, are subject to the\r\nnight-mare.[1889] The best dog of the litter is the one which is last\r\nin obtaining its sight, or else the one which the mother carries first\r\ninto her bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63.—REMEDIES AGAINST CANINE MADNESS.[1890]\r\n\r\n\r\nCanine madness is fatal to man during the heat of Sirius,[1891] and,\r\nas we have already said, it proves so in consequence of those who are\r\nbitten having a deadly horror of water.[1892] For this reason, during\r\nthe thirty days[1893] that this star exerts its influence, we try to\r\nprevent the disease by mixing dung from the poultry-yard with the\r\ndog’s food; or else, if they are already attacked by the disease, by\r\ngiving them hellebore.\r\n\r\n(41.) We have a single remedy against the bite, which has been but\r\nlately discovered, by a kind of oracle, as it were—the root of the\r\nwild rose, which is called cynorrhodos,[1894] or dog-rose. Columella\r\ninforms us, that if, on the fortieth day after the birth of the pup,\r\nthe last bone of the tail is bitten off, the sinew will follow with\r\nit; after which, the tail will not grow, and the dog will never become\r\nrabid.[1895] It is mentioned, among the other prodigies, and this I\r\ntake to be one indeed, that a dog once spoke;[1896] and that when\r\nTarquin was expelled from the kingdom, a serpent barked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64. (42.)—THE NATURE OF THE HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Alexander had also a very remarkable horse;[1897] it was called\r\nBucephalus, either on account of the fierceness of its aspect, or\r\nbecause it had the figure of a bull’s head marked on its shoulder. It\r\nis said, that he was struck with its beauty when he was only a boy, and\r\nthat it was purchased from the stud of Philonicus, the Pharsalian, for\r\nthirteen talents.[1898] When it was equipped with the royal trappings,\r\nit would suffer no one except Alexander to mount it, although at\r\nother times it would allow any one to do so. A memorable circumstance\r\nconnected with it in battle is recorded of this horse; it is said that\r\nwhen it was wounded in the attack upon Thebes, it would not allow\r\nAlexander to mount any other horse. Many other circumstances, also, of\r\na similar nature, occurred respecting it; so that when it died, the\r\nking duly performed its obsequies, and built around its tomb a city,\r\nwhich he named after it.[1899]\r\n\r\nIt is said, also, that Cæsar, the Dictator, had a horse, which would\r\nallow no one to mount but himself, and that its fore-feet were like\r\nthose of a man; indeed it is thus represented in the statue before the\r\ntemple of Venus Genetrix.[1900] The late Emperor Augustus also erected\r\na tomb to his horse; on which occasion Germanicus Cæsar[1901] wrote a\r\npoem, which still exists. There are at Agrigentum many tombs of horses,\r\nin the form of pyramids.[1902] Juba informs us, that Semiramis was so\r\ngreatly enamoured of a horse, as to have had connection with it.[1903]\r\nThe Scythian horsemen make loud boasts of the fame of their cavalry. On\r\none occasion, one of their chiefs having been slain in single combat,\r\nwhen the conqueror came to take the spoils of the enemy, he was set\r\nupon by the horse of his opponent, and trampled on and bitten to death.\r\nAnother horse, upon the bandage being removed from his eyes, found\r\nthat he had covered his mother, upon which he threw himself down a\r\nprecipice, and was killed. We learn, also, that for a similar cause, a\r\ngroom was torn to pieces, in the territory of Reate.[1904] For these\r\nanimals have a knowledge of the ties of consanguinity, and in a stud\r\na mare will attend to its sister of the preceding year, even more\r\ncarefully than its mother.\r\n\r\nTheir docility, too, is so great, that we find it stated that the\r\nwhole of the cavalry of the Sybarite army were accustomed to perform\r\na kind of dance to the sound of musical instruments. These animals\r\nalso foresee battles; they lament over their masters when they have\r\nlost them, and sometimes shed tears[1905] of regret for them. When\r\nKing Nicomedes was slain, his horse put an end to its life by fasting.\r\nPhylarchus relates, that Centaretus,[1906] the Galatian, after he had\r\nslain Antiochus in battle, took possession of his horse, and mounted\r\nit in triumph; upon which the animal, inflamed with indignation,\r\nregardless of the rein and become quite ungovernable, threw itself\r\nheadlong down a precipice, and they both perished together. Philistus\r\nrelates, that Dionysius having left his horse stuck fast in a morass,\r\nthe animal, as soon as it disengaged itself, followed the steps of its\r\nmaster, with a swarm of bees, which had settled on its mane; and that\r\nit was in consequence of this portent, that Dionysius gained possession\r\nof the kingdom.[1907]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65.—THE DISPOSITION OF THE HORSE; REMARKABLE FACTS CONCERNING\r\nCHARIOT HORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese animals possess an intelligence which exceeds all\r\ndescription.[1908] Those who have to use the javelin are well aware\r\nhow the horse, by its exertions and the supple movements of its body,\r\naids the rider in any difficulty he may have in throwing his weapon.\r\nThey will even present to their master the weapons collected on the\r\nground. The horses too, that are yoked to the chariots in the Circus,\r\nbeyond a doubt, display remarkable proofs how sensible they are to\r\nencouragement and to glory. In the Secular games, which were celebrated\r\nin the Circus, under the Emperor Claudius, when the charioteer Corax,\r\nwho belonged to the white party,[1909] was thrown from his place at the\r\nstarting-post, his horses took the lead and kept it, opposing the other\r\nchariots, overturning them, and doing every thing against the other\r\ncompetitors that could have been done, had they been guided by the most\r\nskilful charioteer; and while we quite blushed to behold the skill of\r\nman excelled by that of the horse, they arrived at the goal, after\r\ngoing over the whole of the prescribed course. Our ancestors considered\r\nit as a still more remarkable portent, that when a charioteer had\r\nbeen thrown from his place, in the plebeian games of the Circus,[1910]\r\nthe horses ran to the Capitol, just as if he had been standing in the\r\ncar, and went three times round the temple there. But what is the\r\ngreatest prodigy of all, is the fact that the horses of Ratumenna came\r\nfrom Veii to Rome, with the palm branch and chaplet, he himself having\r\nfallen from his chariot, after having gained the victory; from which\r\ncircumstance the Ratumennian gate derived its name.[1911]\r\n\r\nWhen the Sarmatæ are about to undertake a long journey, they prepare\r\ntheir horses for it, by making them fast the day before, during which\r\nthey give them but little to drink; by these means they are enabled to\r\ntravel on horseback, without stopping, for one hundred and fifty miles.\r\nSome horses are known to live fifty years; but the females are not so\r\nlong-lived.[1912] These last come to their full growth at the fifth\r\nyear, the males a year later. The poet Virgil has very beautifully\r\ndescribed the points which ought more especially to be looked for,\r\nas constituting the perfection of a horse;[1913] I myself have also\r\ntreated of the same subject, in my work[1914] on the Use of the Javelin\r\nby Cavalry, and I find that pretty nearly all writers are agreed\r\nrespecting them.[1915] The points requisite for the Circus are somewhat\r\ndifferent, however; and while horses are put in training for other\r\npurposes at only two years old, they are not admitted to the contests\r\nof the Circus before their fifth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66.—THE GENERATION OF THE HORSE.[1916]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe female of this animal carries her young for eleven months, and\r\nbrings forth in the twelfth. The connection takes place at the vernal\r\nequinox, and generally in both sexes, at the age of two years; but the\r\ncolt is much stronger when the parents are three years old. The males\r\nare capable of covering up to the thirty-third year, and it is not\r\ntill after the twentieth that they are taken for this purpose from\r\nthe Circus. At Opus,[1917] it is said, a horse served as a stallion\r\nuntil his fortieth year; though he required some assistance in raising\r\nthe fore part of the body. There are few animals, however, in which\r\nthe generative powers are so limited, for which reason it is only\r\nadmitted to the female at certain intervals;[1918] indeed it cannot\r\ncover as many as fifteen times in the course of one year.[1919] The\r\nsexual passion of the mare is extinguished by cropping her mane; she is\r\ncapable of bearing every year up to the fortieth. We have an account\r\nof a horse having lived to its seventy-fifth year. The mare brings\r\nforth standing upright, and is attached, beyond all other animals, to\r\nher offspring. The horse is born with a poisonous substance on its\r\nforehead, known as hippomanes,[1920] and used in love philtres; it\r\nis the size of a fig, and of a black colour; the mother devours it\r\nimmediately on the birth of the foal, and until she has done so, she\r\nwill not suckle it. When this substance can be rescued from the mother,\r\nit has the property of rendering the animal quite frantic by the smell.\r\nIf a foal has lost its mother, the other mares in the herd that have\r\nyoung, will take charge of the orphan. It is said that the young of\r\nthis animal cannot touch the earth with the mouth for the first three\r\ndays after its birth. The more spirited a horse is, the deeper does it\r\nplunge its nose into the water while drinking. The Scythians prefer\r\nmares for the purposes of war, because they can pass their urine\r\nwithout stopping in their career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67.—MARES IMPREGNATED BY THE WIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that in Lusitania, in the vicinity of the town\r\nof Olisipo[1921] and the river Tagus, the mares, by turning their\r\nfaces towards the west wind as it blows, become impregnated by its\r\nbreezes,[1922] and that the foals which are conceived in this way are\r\nremarkable for their extreme fleetness; but they never live beyond\r\nthree years. Gallicia and Asturia are also countries of Spain; they\r\nproduce a species of horse known to us as thieldones,[1923] and when\r\nsmaller, asturcones;[1924] they have a peculiar and not common pace\r\nof their own, which is very easy, and arises from the two legs of the\r\nsame side being moved together;[1925] it is by studying the nature of\r\nthis step that our horses have been taught the movement which we call\r\nambling.[1926] Horses have very nearly the same diseases as men;[1927]\r\nbesides which, they are subject to an irregular action of the bladder,\r\nas, indeed, is the case with all beasts of burden.[1928]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68. (45.)—THE ASS, ITS GENERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Varro informs us that Quintus Axius, the senator, paid for an ass\r\nthe sum of four hundred thousand sesterces;[1929] I am not sure\r\nwhether this did not exceed the price ever given for any other animal.\r\nIt is certainly a species of animal singularly useful for labour and\r\nploughing,[1930] but more especially for the production of mules.[1931]\r\nIn these animals also, the country in which they are born is taken\r\ninto consideration; in Greece, those from Arcadia[1932] are the most\r\nvalued; and in Italy, those of Reate.[1933] The ass is an animal which\r\nis unable to endure cold,[1934] for which reason it is that it is\r\nnever produced in Pontus; nor is it allowed to cover at the vernal\r\nequinox, like other cattle, but at the summer solstice. The males are\r\nless proper for covering, when out of work. The earliest age at which\r\nthe females are ever capable of bearing is the thirtieth month, but\r\nthe usual time begins at the age of three years. The number to which\r\nit gives birth is the same as the mare, which it also resembles, in\r\nthe length of its gestation, and in its mode of bringing forth; but\r\nthe female will discharge the generative fluid from the womb, being\r\nunable to retain it, unless by blows she is forced to run immediately\r\nafter being covered. They seldom bring forth two at one birth.[1935]\r\nWhen the she-ass is about to bring forth, she shuns the light and seeks\r\ndarkness, in order to escape the observation of man. Asses are capable\r\nof breeding throughout the whole of their life, which extends to thirty\r\nyears. Their attachment to their young is great in the extreme, but\r\ntheir aversion to water is still greater. They will pass through fire\r\nto get at their foals, while the very same animal, if the smallest\r\nstream intervenes, will tremble, and not dare so much as to wet even\r\nits feet. Nor yet in their pastures will they ever drink at any but the\r\nusual watering-place, and they make it their care to find some dry path\r\nby which to get at it. They will not pass over a bridge either, when\r\nthe water can be seen between the planks beneath.[1936] Wonderful to\r\nrelate, too, if their watering-places are changed, though they should\r\nbe ever so thirsty, they will not drink without being either beaten or\r\ncaressed. They ought always to have plenty of room for sleeping; for\r\nthey are very subject to various diseases in their sleep, when they\r\nrepeatedly throw out their feet, and would immediately lame themselves\r\nby coming in contact with any hard substance; so that it is necessary\r\nthat they should be provided with an empty space. The profit which\r\nis derived from these animals exceeds that arising from the richest\r\nestate. It is a well-known fact, that in Celtiberia there are some\r\nshe-asses which have produced to their owners as much as four hundred\r\nthousand sesterces.[1937] In the rearing of she-mules it is said to\r\nbe particularly necessary to attend to the colour of the hair of the\r\nears and the eyelids, for, although the rest of the body be all of one\r\ncolour, the mule that is produced will have all the colours that are\r\nfound in those parts. Mæcenas was the first person who had the young\r\nof the ass served up at his table;[1938] they were in those times much\r\npreferred to the onager or wild ass;[1939] but, since his time, the\r\ntaste has gone out of fashion. An ass, after witnessing the death of\r\nanother ass, survives it but a very short time only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69. (44.)—THE NATURE OF MULES,[1940] AND OF OTHER BEASTS OF\r\nBURDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the union of the male ass and the mare a mule is produced in the\r\nthirteenth month, an animal remarkable for its strength in laborious\r\nwork. We are told that, for this purpose, the mare ought not to be less\r\nthan four years old, nor more than ten. It is said also that these two\r\nspecies will repulse each other, unless the male has been brought up,\r\nin its infancy, upon the milk of the other species; for which reason\r\nthey take the foals away from the mare, in the dark, and substitute\r\nfor them the male colts of the ass. A mule may also be produced from\r\na horse and a female ass; but it can never be properly broken in,\r\nand is incorrigibly sluggish,[1941] being in all respects as slow as\r\nan old animal. If a mare has conceived by a horse, and is afterwards\r\ncovered by an ass, the first conception is abortive; but this is not\r\nthe case when the horse comes after the ass. It has been observed,\r\nthat the female is in the best state for receiving the male in the\r\nseventh day after parturition, and that the males are best adapted\r\nfor the purpose when they are fatigued.[1942] A female ass, which\r\nhas not conceived before shedding what are called the milk-teeth, is\r\nconsidered to be barren; which is also looked upon as the case when a\r\nshe-ass does not become pregnant after the first covering. The male\r\nwhich is produced from a horse and a female ass, was called by the\r\nancients “hinnulus,” and that from an ass and a mare “mulus.”[1943]\r\nIt has been observed that the animal which is thus produced by the\r\nunion of the two species is of a third species, and does not resemble\r\neither of the parents; and that all animals produced in this way, of\r\nwhatever kind they may be, are incapable of reproduction; she-mules are\r\ntherefore barren. It is said, indeed, in our Annals, that they have\r\nfrequently brought forth;[1944] but such cases must be looked upon only\r\nas prodigies.[1945] Theophrastus says that they commonly bring forth\r\nin Cappadocia; but that the animal of that country is of a peculiar\r\nspecies.[1946] The mule is prevented from kicking by frequently giving\r\nit wine to drink.[1947] It is said in the works of many of the Greek\r\nwriters, that from the union of a mule with a mare, the dwarf mule is\r\nproduced, which they call “ginnus.” From the union of the mare and the\r\nwild ass, when it has been domesticated, a mule is produced which is\r\nremarkably swift in running, and has extremely hard feet, and a thin\r\nbody, while it has a spirit that is quite indomitable. The very best\r\nstallion of all, however, for this purpose, is one produced from a\r\nunion of the wild ass and the female domesticated ass. The best wild\r\nasses are those of Phrygia and Lycaonia. Africa glories in the wild\r\nfoals which she produces, as excelling all others in flavour; these are\r\ncalled “lalisiones.”[1948] It appears from some Athenian records, that\r\na mule once lived to the age of eighty years. The people were greatly\r\ndelighted with this animal, because on one occasion, when, on the\r\nbuilding of a temple in the citadel,[1949] it had been left behind on\r\naccount of its age, it persisted in promoting the work by accompanying\r\nand assisting them; in consequence of which a decree was passed, that\r\nthe dealers in corn were not to drive it away from their sieves.[1950]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70. (45.)—OXEN; THEIR GENERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find it stated, that the oxen of India are of the height of camels,\r\nand that the extremity of their horns are four feet asunder. In our\r\npart of the world the most valuable oxen are those of Epirus, owing, it\r\nis said, to the attention paid to their breed by King Pyrrhus.[1951]\r\nThis perfection was acquired by not permitting them to breed until\r\nafter their fourth year. By these means he brought them to a very large\r\nsize, and descendants of this breed are still to be seen at the present\r\nday. But in our times, we set heifers to breed in their first year, or,\r\nat the latest, in their second. Bulls are fit for breeding in their\r\nfourth year; one being sufficient, it is said, for ten cows during the\r\nwhole year. If the bull, after covering, goes to the right side, the\r\nproduce will be a male; if to the left, a female.[1952] Conception\r\ntakes place after a single union; but if, by any accident, it should\r\nnot have taken place, the cow seeks the male again, at the end of\r\ntwenty days. She brings forth in the tenth month; whatever may be\r\nproduced before that time cannot be reared. Some writers say, that the\r\nbirth takes place the very day on which the tenth month is completed.\r\nThis animal but rarely produces twins. The time of covering begins at\r\nthe rising of the Dolphin, the day before the nones of January,[1953]\r\nand continues for the space of thirty days. Sometimes it takes place\r\nin the autumn; and among those nations which live upon milk, they\r\nmanage so as to have a supply of it at all times of the year. Bulls\r\nnever cover more than twice in the same day. The ox is the only animal\r\nthat walks backwards while it is feeding; among the Garamantes, they\r\nfeed in no other manner.[1954] The females live fifteen years at the\r\nlongest, and the males twenty; they arrive at their full vigour in\r\ntheir fifth year. It is said that they are made fat by being washed\r\nin warm water, or by having the entrails inflated with air by means of\r\na reed, introduced through an incision in the skin. We must not look\r\nupon those kinds as having degenerated, the appearance of which is not\r\nso favourable. Those that are bred in the Alps, although very small\r\nof body, give a great quantity of milk, and are capable of enduring\r\nmuch labour; they are yoked by the horns, and not by the neck. The\r\noxen of Syria have no dewlap, but they have a hump on the back. Those\r\nof Caria also, which is in Asia, are unsightly[1955] in appearance,\r\nhaving a hump hanging over the shoulders from the neck; and their horns\r\nare moveable;[1956] they are said, however, to be excellent workers,\r\nthough those which are either black or white are condemned as worthless\r\nfor labour.[1957] The horns of the bull are shorter and thinner than\r\nthose of the ox. Oxen must be broken in when they are three years old;\r\nafter that time it is too late, and before that time too early. The\r\nox is most easily broken in by yoking it with one that has already\r\nbeen trained.[1958] This animal is our especial companion, both in\r\nlabour generally, and in the operations of agriculture. Our ancestors\r\nconsidered it of so much value, that there is an instance cited of a\r\nman being brought before the Roman people, on a day appointed, and\r\ncondemned, for having killed an ox, in order to humour an impudent\r\nconcubine of his, who said that she had never tasted tripe; and he\r\nwas driven into exile, just as though he had killed one of his own\r\npeasants.[1959]\r\n\r\nThe bull has a proud air, a stern forehead, shaggy ears, and horns\r\nwhich appear always ready, and challenging to the combat; but it is\r\nby his fore feet that he manifests his threatening anger. As his rage\r\nincreases, he stands, lashing back his tail[1960] every now and then,\r\nand throwing up the sand against his belly; being the only animal that\r\nexcites himself by these means. We have seen them fight at the word of\r\ncommand, and shown as a public spectacle; these bulls whirled about and\r\nthen fell upon their horns, and at once were up again; then, at other\r\ntimes, they would lie upon the ground and let themselves be lifted up;\r\nthey would even stand in a two-horsed chariot, while moving at a rapid\r\nrate, like so many charioteers.[1961] The people of Thessaly invented a\r\nmethod of killing bulls, by means of a man on horseback, who would ride\r\nup to them, and seize one of the horns, and so twist their neck. Cæsar\r\nthe Dictator was the first person who exhibited this spectacle at Rome.\r\n\r\nBulls are selected as the very choicest of victims, and are offered up\r\nas the most approved sacrifice for appeasing the gods.[1962] Of all the\r\nanimals that have long tails, this is the only one whose tail is not of\r\nproportionate length at the moment of birth; and in this animal alone\r\nit continues to grow until it reaches its heels. It is on this account,\r\nthat in making choice of a calf for a victim, due care is taken that\r\nits tail reaches to the pastern joint; if it is shorter than this, the\r\nsacrifice is not deemed acceptable to the gods. This fact has also been\r\nremarked, that calves, which have been carried to the altar on men’s\r\nshoulders, are not generally acceptable to the gods; and also, if they\r\nare lame, or of a species which is not appropriate,[1963] or if they\r\nstruggle to get away from the altar. It was a not uncommon prodigy\r\namong the ancients, for an ox to speak;[1964] upon such a fact being\r\nannounced to the senate, they were in the habit of holding a meeting in\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 71. (46.)—THE EGYPTIAN APIS.[1965]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Egypt an ox is even worshipped as a deity; they call it Apis. It\r\nis distinguished by a conspicuous white spot on the right side, in\r\nthe form of a crescent. There is a knot also under the tongue, which\r\nis called “cantharus.”[1966] This ox is not allowed to live beyond\r\na certain number of years; it is then destroyed by being drowned in\r\nthe fountain of the priests. They then go, amid general mourning, and\r\nseek another ox to replace it; and the mourning is continued, with\r\ntheir heads shaved, until such time as they have found one; it is not\r\nlong, however, at any time, before they meet with a successor. When\r\none has been found, it is brought by the priests to Memphis. There are\r\ntwo temples appropriated to it, which are called thalami,[1967] and\r\nto these the people resort to learn the auguries. According as the\r\nox enters the one or the other of these places, the augury is deemed\r\nfavourable or unfavourable. It gives answers to individuals, by taking\r\nfood from the hand of those who consult it. It turned away from the\r\nhand of Germanicus Cæsar, and not long after he died.[1968] In general\r\nit lives in secret; but, when it comes forth in public, the multitudes\r\nmake way for it, and it is attended by a crowd of boys, singing hymns\r\nin honour of it; it appears to be sensible of the adoration thus paid\r\nto it, and to court it. These crowds, too, suddenly become inspired,\r\nand predict future events. Once in the year a female is presented to\r\nthe ox, which likewise has her appropriate marks, although different\r\nfrom those on the male; and it is said that she is always killed the\r\nvery same day that they find her. There is a spot in the Nile, near\r\nMemphis, which, from its figure, they call Phiala;[1969] here they\r\nthrow into the water a dish of gold, and another of silver, every year\r\nupon the days on which they celebrate the birth of Apis.[1970] These\r\ndays are seven in number, and it is a remarkable thing, that during\r\nthis time, no one is ever attacked by the crocodile; on the eighth day,\r\nhowever, after the sixth hour, these beasts resume all their former\r\nferocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 72. (47.)—SHEEP, AND THEIR PROPAGATION.[1971]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks, too, do we owe to the sheep, both for appeasing the gods,\r\nand for giving us the use of its fleece. As oxen cultivate the fields\r\nwhich yield food for man, so to sheep are we indebted for the defence\r\nof our bodies. The generative power lasts in both sexes from the second\r\nto the ninth year, sometimes to the tenth.[1972] The lambs produced\r\nat the first birth are but small. The season for coupling, in all of\r\nthem, is from the setting of Arcturus, that is to say, the third day\r\nbefore the ides of May,[1973] to the setting of Aquila, the tenth day\r\nbefore the calends of August.[1974] The period of gestation is one\r\nhundred and fifty days. The lambs that are produced after this time are\r\nfeeble; the ancients called those that were born after it, cordi.[1975]\r\nMany persons prefer the lambs that are born in the winter to those of\r\nthe spring, because it is of much more consequence that they should\r\nhave gained strength before the summer solstice than before the winter\r\none; consequently, the sheep is the only animal that is benefitted\r\nby being born in the middle of winter. It is the nature of the ram\r\nto reject the young and prefer the old ones, and he himself is more\r\nserviceable when old,[1976] and when deprived of his horns.[1977] He\r\nis also rendered less violent by having one horn pierced towards the\r\near. If the right testicle is tied up, the ram will generate females,\r\nand if the left, males.[1978] The noise of thunder produces abortion\r\nin sheep, if they are left alone; to prevent such accidents, they are\r\nbrought together into flocks, that they may be rendered less timid by\r\nbeing in company. When the north-east wind blows, males are said to be\r\nconceived; and when the south wind, females. In this kind of animal,\r\nthe mouth of the ram is especially looked to, for whatever may be the\r\ncolour of the veins under the tongue, the wool of the young one will be\r\nof a similar colour.[1979] If these veins are many in number, it will\r\nbe mottled. Any change, too, in their water or drink, will render them\r\nmottled.[1980]\r\n\r\nThere are two principal kinds of sheep, the covered[1981] and the\r\ncolonic,[1982] or common sheep; the former is the more tender animal,\r\nbut the latter is more nice about its pastures, for the covered sheep\r\nwill feed on brambles even. The best coverings for sheep are brought\r\nfrom Arabia.[1983]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 73. (43.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOOL, AND THEIR COLOURS.[1984]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most esteemed wool of all is that of Apulia, and that which in\r\nItaly is called Grecian wool, in other countries Italian. The fleeces\r\nof Miletus hold the third rank.[1985] The Apulian wool is shorter in\r\nthe hair, and only owes its high character to the cloaks[1986] that are\r\nmade of it. That which comes from the vicinity of Tarentum and Canusium\r\nis the most celebrated; and there is a wool from Laodicea, in Asia, of\r\na similar quality.[1987] There is no white wool superior to that of the\r\ncountries bordering on the Padus,[1988] nor up to the present day has\r\nany wool exceeded the price of one hundred sesterces per pound.[1989]\r\nThe sheep are not shorn in all countries; in some places it is still\r\nthe custom to pull off the wool.[1990] There are various colours of\r\nwool; so much so, indeed, that we want terms to express them all.\r\nSeveral kinds, which are called native,[1991] are found in Spain;\r\nPollentia, in the vicinity of the Alps,[1992] produces black fleeces of\r\nthe best quality; Asia, as well as Bætica,[1993] the red fleeces, which\r\nare called Erythræan; those of Canusium are of a tawny colour;[1994]\r\nand those of Tarentum have their peculiar dark tint.[1995] All kinds of\r\nwool, when not freed from the grease,[1996] possess certain medicinal\r\nproperties. The wool of Istria is much more like hair than wool, and is\r\nnot suitable for the fabrication of stuffs that have a long nap;[1997]\r\nso too is that which Salacia,[1998] in Lusitania, finds the most useful\r\nfor making its chequered cloths. There is a similar wool, too, found\r\nabout Piscenæ,[1999] in the province of Narbonensis, as also in Egypt;\r\na garment, when it has been worn for some time, is often embroidered\r\nwith this wool, and will last for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nThe thick, flocky wool has been esteemed for the manufacture of\r\ncarpets from the very earliest times; it is quite clear, from what\r\nwe read in Homer, that they were in use in his time.[2000] The Gauls\r\nembroider them in a different manner from that which is practised by\r\nthe Parthians.[2001] Wool is compressed also for making a felt,[2002]\r\nwhich, if soaked in vinegar,[2003] is capable of resisting iron\r\neven; and, what is still more, after having gone through the last\r\nprocess,[2004] wool will even resist fire; the refuse, too, when taken\r\nout of the vat of the scourer, is used for making mattresses,[2005]\r\nan invention, I fancy, of the Gauls. At all events, it is by Gallic\r\nnames that we distinguish the different sort of mattresses[2006] at the\r\npresent day; but I am not well able to say at what period wool began to\r\nbe employed for this purpose. Our ancestors made use of straw[2007] for\r\nthe purpose of sleeping upon, just as they do at present when in camp.\r\nThe gausapa[2008] has been brought into use in my father’s memory, and\r\nI myself recollect the amphimalla[2009] and the long shaggy apron[2010]\r\nbeing introduced; but at the present day, the laticlave tunic[2011] is\r\nbeginning to be manufactured, in imitation of the gausapa.[2012] Black\r\nwool will take no colour. I shall describe the mode of dyeing the\r\nother kinds of wool when speaking of the sea-purple,[2013] or of the\r\nnature of various plants.[2014]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 74.—DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLOTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarro informs us, he himself having been an eye-witness, that in the\r\ntemple of Sancus,[2015] the wool was still preserved on the distaff and\r\nspindle of Tanaquil,[2016] who was also called Caia Cæcilia; and he\r\nsays that the royal waved[2017] toga, formerly worn by Servius Tullius,\r\nand now in the temple of Fortune, was made by her. Hence was derived\r\nthe custom, on the marriage of a young woman, of carrying in the\r\nprocession a dressed distaff and a spindle, with the thread arranged\r\nupon it. Tanaquil was the first who wove the straight tunic,[2018]\r\nsuch as our young people wear with the white toga;[2019] newly-married\r\nwomen also. Waved garments were at first the most esteemed of all:\r\nafter which those composed of various colours[2020] came into vogue.\r\nFenestella informs us, that togas with a smooth surface, as well\r\nas the Phryxian togas,[2021] began to be used in the latter part of\r\nthe reign of Augustus. Thick stuffs, in the preparation of which the\r\npoppy[2022] was used, are of more ancient date, being mentioned by the\r\npoet Lucilius, in his lines on Torquatus. The prætexta[2023] had its\r\norigin among the Etrurians. I find that the trabea[2024] was first\r\nworn by the kings; embroidered garments are mentioned by Homer,[2025]\r\nand in this class originated the triumphal robes.[2026] The Phrygians\r\nfirst used the needle for this purpose,[2027] and hence this kind of\r\ngarment obtained the name of Phrygionian. King Attalus, who also lived\r\nin Asia, invented the art of embroidering with gold, from which these\r\ngarments have been called Attalic.[2028] Babylon was very famous for\r\nmaking embroidery in different colours, and hence stuffs of this kind\r\nhave obtained the name of Babylonian.[2029] The method of weaving\r\ncloth with more than two threads was invented at Alexandria; these\r\ncloths are called polymita;[2030] it was in Gaul that they were first\r\ndivided into chequers.[2031] Metellus Scipio, in the accusation which\r\nhe brought against Cato,[2032] stated that even in his time Babylonian\r\ncovers for couches were selling for eight hundred thousand sesterces,\r\nand these of late, in the time of the Emperor Nero, had risen to four\r\nmillions.[2033] The prætextæ of Servius Tullius, with which the statue\r\nof Fortune, dedicated by him, was covered,[2034] lasted until the\r\ndeath of Sejanus; and it is a remarkable fact, that, during a period\r\nof five hundred and sixty years, they had never become tattered,[2035]\r\nor received injury from moths. I myself have seen the fleece upon\r\nthe living animal dyed purple, scarlet, and violet,—a pound and a\r\nhalf[2036] of dye being used for each,—just as though they had been\r\nproduced by Nature in this form, to meet the demands of luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 75.—THE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF SHEEP; THE MUSMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sheep, it is considered a proof of its being of a very fair\r\nbreed, when the legs are short, and the belly is covered with wool;\r\nwhen this part is bare, they used to be called apicæ, and were looked\r\nupon as worthless.[2037] The tail of the Syrian sheep is a cubit in\r\nlength,[2038] and it is upon that part that most of the wool is found.\r\nIt is considered too early to castrate lambs before they are five\r\nmonths old.\r\n\r\n(49.) There is in Spain, and more especially in Corsica, a peculiar\r\nkind of animal called the musmon,[2039] not very unlike a sheep, but\r\nwith a fleece which more resembles the hair of the goat than the wool\r\nof the sheep. The ancients gave the name of umbri[2040] to the breed\r\nbetween this animal and the sheep. The head of the sheep is the weakest\r\npart of all, on which account it is obliged, when it feeds, to turn\r\naway from the sun.[2041] The animals which are covered with wool are\r\nthe most stupid of all.[2042] When they are afraid to enter any place,\r\nif one is only dragged into it by the horns, all the rest will follow.\r\nThe longest duration of their life is ten years; but in Æthiopia it is\r\nthirteen. Goats live in that country eleven years, but in other parts\r\nof the world mostly eight years only. Both of these animals require to\r\nbe covered not more than four times to ensure conception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 76. (50.)—GOATS AND THEIR PROPAGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goat occasionally brings forth as many as four at a birth; but\r\nthis is rarely the case.[2043] It is pregnant five months, like the\r\nsheep. Goats become barren when very fat. There is little advantage\r\nto be derived from their bringing forth before their third year,\r\nor after the fourth, when they begin to grow old.[2044] They are\r\ncapable of generating in the seventh month, and while they are still\r\nsucking. In both sexes those that have no horns are considered the\r\nmost valuable.[2045] A single coupling in the day is not sufficient;\r\nthe second and the following ones are more effectual. They conceive\r\nin the month of November, so as to bring forth in the month of March,\r\nwhen the buds are bursting; this is sometimes the case with them when\r\nonly one year old, and always with those of the second year; but the\r\nproduce of those which are three years old is the most valuable.[2046]\r\nThey continue to bring forth for a period of eight years. Cold produces\r\nabortion. When their eyes are surcharged, the female discharges the\r\nblood from the eye by pricking it with the point of a bulrush, and the\r\nmale with the thorn of a bramble.\r\n\r\nMutianus relates an instance of the intelligence of this animal, of\r\nwhich he himself was an eye-witness. Two goats, coming from opposite\r\ndirections, met on a very narrow bridge, which would not admit of\r\neither of them turning round, and in consequence of its great length,\r\nthey could not safely go backwards, there being no sure footing on\r\naccount of its narrowness, while at the same time an impetuous torrent\r\nwas rapidly rushing beneath; accordingly, one of the animals lay down\r\nflat, while the other walked over it.\r\n\r\nAmong the males, those are the most esteemed which have flat noses and\r\nlong hanging ears,[2047] the shoulders being covered with very thick\r\nshaggy hair; the mark of the most valuable among the females is the\r\nhaving two folds[2048] hanging down the body from under the neck. Some\r\nof these animals have no horns; but where there are horns, the age\r\nof the animal is denoted by the number of knots on them. Those that\r\nhave no horns give the most milk.[2049] According to Archelaus,[2050]\r\nthey breathe, not through the nose, but the ears,[2051] and they are\r\nnever entirely free from fever,[2052] from which circumstance it is,\r\nprobably, that they are more animated than sheep, more ardent, and\r\nhave stronger sexual passions. It is said also, that they have the\r\npower of seeing by night as well as in the day, for which reason those\r\npersons who are called Nyctalopes,[2053] recover the power of seeing\r\nin the evening, by eating the liver of the he-goat. In Cilicia, and\r\nin the vicinity of the Syrtes, the inhabitants shear the goat for the\r\npurpose of clothing themselves.[2054] It is said that the she-goats in\r\nthe pastures will never look at each other at sun-set, but lie with\r\ntheir backs towards one another,[2055] while at other times of the day\r\nthey lie facing each other and in family groups. They all have long\r\nhair hanging down from the chin, which is called by us aruncus.[2056]\r\nIf any one of the flock is taken hold of and dragged by this hair,\r\nall the rest gaze on in stupid astonishment; and the same happens\r\nwhen any one of them has eaten of a certain herb.[2057] Their bite is\r\nvery destructive to trees, and they make the olive barren by licking\r\nit;[2058] for which reason they are not sacrificed to Minerva.[2059]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 77. (51.)—THE HOG.[2060]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period for coupling the hog lasts from the return of the west wind\r\nto the vernal equinox; the proper age commences in the eighth month,\r\nindeed, in some places, in the fourth even, and continues until the\r\neighth year.[2061] They bring forth twice in the year, the time of\r\ngestation being four months; the number at a birth amounts to twenty\r\neven, but they cannot rear so large a number.[2062] Nigidius informs\r\nus, that those which are produced within ten days of the winter\r\nsolstice are born with teeth. One coupling is sufficient, but it is\r\nrepeated, on account of their extreme liability to abortion; the remedy\r\nfor which is not to allow coupling the first time the female is in\r\nheat, nor until its ears are flaccid and pendant. The males do not\r\ngenerate after they are three years old. When the females become feeble\r\nfrom old age, they receive the males lying down.[2063] It is not looked\r\nupon as anything portentous when they eat their young. The young of the\r\nhog is considered in a state of purity for sacrifice when five days\r\nold,[2064] the lamb on the seventh day, and the calf on the thirtieth.\r\nCoruncanius asserts, that ruminant animals are not proper for victims\r\nuntil they have two teeth.[2065] It has been supposed, that when a\r\npig has lost one eye, it will not live long;[2066] otherwise, these\r\nanimals generally live up to fifteen, or sometimes twenty years. They\r\nsometimes become mad; besides which, they are liable to other diseases,\r\nespecially to quinsy[2067] and to scrofula.[2068] It is an indication\r\nthat the hog is diseased, when blood is found at the root of a bristle\r\npulled from its back, and when it holds its head on one side while\r\nwalking. When the female becomes too fat, she has a deficiency of milk;\r\nthe first litter is always the least numerous. Animals of this kind\r\ndelight in rolling in the mud.[2069] The tail is curled, and it has\r\nalso been remarked, that those are a more acceptable offering to the\r\ngods, whose tail is turned to the right than those which have it turned\r\nto the left. They may be fattened in sixty days, and more especially\r\nif they have been kept without food for three days before fattening.\r\nThe swine is by far the most brutish of all the animals, and it has\r\nbeen said, and not unaptly, that life has been given them in place of\r\nsalt.[2070] And yet it has been known, that these animals, when carried\r\naway by thieves, have recognized the voice of their keeper; and when\r\na vessel has been under water through the inclination of one of its\r\nsides, they have had the sense to go over to the other side. The leader\r\nof the herd will even learn to go to market, and to different houses\r\nin the city. In the wild state also, they have the sense to pass their\r\nurine in plashy places, that they may destroy all traces of them, and\r\nso lighten themselves for flight.[2071] The female is spayed, just\r\nas is done with the camel; after they have fasted two days, they are\r\nsuspended by the hind feet, and the orifice of the womb is cut; after\r\nthis operation, they fatten more quickly.[2072]\r\n\r\nM. Apicius[2073] made the discovery, that we may employ the same\r\nartificial method of increasing the size of the liver of the sow, as\r\nof that of the goose;[2074] it consists in cramming them with dried\r\nfigs, and when they are fat enough, they are drenched with wine mixed\r\nwith honey, and immediately killed. There is no animal that affords\r\na greater variety to the palate of the epicure; all the others have\r\ntheir own peculiar flavour, but the flesh of the hog has nearly\r\nfifty different flavours. Hence it is, that there are whole pages of\r\nregulations made by the censors, forbidding the serving up at banquets\r\nof the belly, the kernels,[2075] the testicles, the womb, and the\r\ncheeks. However, notwithstanding all this, the poet Publius,[2076] the\r\nauthor of the Mimes, when he ceased to be a slave, is said to have\r\ngiven no entertainment without serving up the belly of a sow, to which\r\nhe also gave the name of “sumen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 78.—THE WILD BOAR; WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ESTABLISH PARKS FOR WILD\r\nANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the wild boar is also much esteemed. Cato, the Censor, in\r\nhis orations, strongly declaimed against the use of the brawn of the\r\nwild boar.[2077] The animal used to be divided into three portions, the\r\nmiddle part of which was laid by,[2078] and is called boar’s chine. P.\r\nServilius Rullus was the first Roman who served up a whole boar at a\r\nbanquet; the father of that Rullus, who, in the consulship of Cicero,\r\nproposed the Agrarian law. So recent is the introduction of a thing\r\nwhich is now in daily use. The Annalists have taken notice of such a\r\nfact as this, clearly as a hint to us to mend our manners; seeing that\r\nnow-a-days two or three boars are consumed, not at one entertainment,\r\nbut as forming the first course only.\r\n\r\n(52.) Fulvius Lupinus was the first Roman who formed parks[2079] for\r\nthe reception of these and other wild animals: he first fed them in the\r\nterritory of Tarquinii: it was not long, however, that imitators were\r\nfound in L. Lucullus and Q. Hortensius.[2080] The wild sow brings forth\r\nonce only in the year. The males are very fierce during the rutting\r\ntime; they fight with each other, having first hardened their sides by\r\nrubbing them against the trees, and covered themselves with mud. The\r\nfemales, as is the case with animals of every kind, become more fierce\r\njust after they have brought forth. The wild boar is not capable of\r\ngenerating before the first year. The wild boar of India[2081] has two\r\ncurved teeth, projecting from beneath the muzzle, a cubit in length;\r\nand the same number projecting from the forehead, like the horns of the\r\nyoung bull. The hair of these animals, in a wild state, is the colour\r\nof copper, the others are black. No species whatever of the swine is\r\nfound in Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 79. (53.)—ANIMALS IN A HALF-WILD STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no species is the union with the wild animal so easy as in that\r\nof the swine; the produce of such unions was called by the ancients\r\nhybrid,[2082] or half savage; which appellation has also been\r\ntransferred to the human race, as it was to C. Antonius, the colleague\r\nof Cicero in his consulship. Not only, however, with respect to the\r\nhog, but all other animals as well, wherever there is a tame species,\r\nthere is a corresponding wild one as well; a fact which is equally\r\ntrue with reference to man himself, as is proved by the many races of\r\nwild men of which we have already spoken.[2083] There is no kind of\r\nanimal, however, that is divided into a greater number of varieties\r\nthan the goat. There are the capræa,[2084] the rupicapra or rock-goat,\r\nand the ibex, an animal of wonderful swiftness, although its head is\r\nloaded with immense horns, which bear a strong resemblance to the\r\nsheath of a sword.[2085] By means of these horns the animal balances\r\nitself, when it darts along the rocks, as though it had been hurled\r\nfrom a sling;[2086] more especially when it wishes to leap from one\r\neminence to another. There are the oryges also,[2087] which are said to\r\nbe the only animals that have the hair the contrary way, the points\r\nbeing turned towards the head. There are the dama also,[2088] the\r\npygargus,[2089] and the strepsiceros,[2090] besides many others which\r\nstrongly resemble them. The first mentioned of these animals,[2091]\r\nhowever, dwell in the Alps; all the others are sent to us from the\r\nparts beyond sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 80. (54.)—APES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of apes, which approach the nearest to the human\r\nfigure, are distinguished from each other by the tail.[2092] Their\r\nshrewdness is quite wonderful. It is said that, imitating the hunters,\r\nthey will besmear themselves with bird-lime, and put their feet into\r\nthe shoes, which, as so many snares, have been prepared for them.[2093]\r\nMucianus says, that they have even played at chess, having, by\r\npractice, learned to distinguish the different pieces, which are made\r\nof wax.[2094] He says that the species which have tails become quite\r\nmelancholy when the moon is on the wane, and that they leap for joy\r\nat the time of the new moon, and adore it. Other quadrupeds also are\r\nterrified at the eclipses of the heavenly bodies. All the species of\r\napes manifest remarkable affection for their offspring. Females, which\r\nhave been domesticated, and have had young ones, carry them about and\r\nshew them to all comers, shew great delight when they are caressed,\r\nand appear to understand the kindness thus shewn them. Hence it is,\r\nthat they very often stifle their young with their embraces. The\r\ndog’s-headed ape[2095] is of a much fiercer nature, as is the case with\r\nthe satyr. The callitriche[2096] has almost a totally different aspect;\r\nit has a beard on the face, and a tail, which in the first part of it\r\nis very bushy. It is said that this animal cannot live except in the\r\nclimate of Æthiopia, which is its native place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 81. (55.)—THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF HARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous species of hares. Those in the Alps are\r\nwhite,[2097] and it is believed that, during the winter, they live\r\nupon snow for food; at all events, every year, as the snow melts, they\r\nacquire a reddish colour; it is, moreover, an animal which is capable\r\nof existing in the most severe climates. There is also a species of\r\nhare, in Spain, which is called the rabbit;[2098] it is extremely\r\nprolific, and produces famine in the Balearic islands, by destroying\r\nthe harvests. The young ones, either when cut from out of the body\r\nof the mother, or taken from the breast, without having the entrails\r\nremoved, are considered a most delicate food; they are then called\r\nlaurices.[2099] It is a well-known fact, that the inhabitants of the\r\nBalearic islands begged of the late Emperor Augustus the aid of a\r\nnumber of soldiers, to prevent the too rapid increase of these animals.\r\nThe ferret[2100] is greatly esteemed for its skill in catching them.\r\nIt is thrown into the burrows, with their numerous outlets, which the\r\nrabbits form, and from which circumstance they derive their name,[2101]\r\nand as it drives them out, they are taken above. Archelaus informs us,\r\nthat in the hare, the number of cavernous receptacles in the body for\r\nthe excrements always equals that of its years;[2102] but still the\r\nnumbers are sometimes found to differ. He says also, that the same\r\nindividual possesses the characteristics of the two sexes, and that it\r\nbecomes pregnant just as well without the aid of the male. It is a kind\r\nprovision of Nature, in making animals which are both harmless and good\r\nfor food, thus prolific. The hare, which is preyed upon by all other\r\nanimals, is the only one, except the dasypus,[2103] which is capable of\r\nsuperfœtation;[2104] while the mother is suckling one of her young, she\r\nhas another in the womb covered with hair, another without any covering\r\nat all, and another which is just beginning to be formed. Attempts\r\nhave been made to form a kind of stuff of the hair of these animals;\r\nbut it is not so soft as when attached to the skin, and, in consequence\r\nof the shortness of the hairs, soon falls to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 82. (56.)—ANIMALS WHICH ARE TAMED IN PART ONLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHares are seldom tamed, and yet they cannot properly be called wild\r\nanimals; indeed, there are many species of them which are neither tame\r\nnor wild, but of a sort of intermediate nature; of the same kind there\r\nare among the winged animals, swallows and bees, and among the sea\r\nanimals, the dolphin.\r\n\r\n(57.) Many persons have placed that inhabitant of our houses, the\r\nmouse, in this class also; an animal which is not to be despised, for\r\nthe portents which it has afforded, even in relation to public events.\r\nBy gnawing the silver shields at Lanuvium,[2105] mice prognosticated\r\nthe Marsian war; and the death of our general, Carbo, at Clusium,[2106]\r\nby gnawing the latchets with which he fastened his shoes.[2107] There\r\nare many species of this animal in the territory of Cyrenaica; some\r\nof them with a wide, others with a projecting, forehead, and some\r\nagain with bristling hair, like the hedgehog.[2108] We are informed\r\nby Theophrastus, that after the mice had driven the inhabitants of\r\nGyara[2109] from their island, they even gnawed the iron; which they\r\nalso do, by a kind of natural instinct, in the iron forges among the\r\nChalybes. In gold mines, too, their stomachs are opened for this\r\npurpose, and some of the metal is always to be found there, which they\r\nhave pilfered,[2110] so great a delight do they take in stealing! We\r\nlearn from our Annals, also, that at the siege of Casilinum,[2111] by\r\nHannibal, a mouse was sold for two hundred denarii,[2112] and that the\r\nperson who sold it perished with hunger, while the purchaser survived.\r\nTo be visited by white mice is considered as indicative of a fortunate\r\nevent; but our Annals are full of instances in which the singing[2113]\r\nof a mouse has interrupted the auspices.[2114] Nigidius informs us,\r\nthat the field-mouse conceals itself during winter: this is also said\r\nto be the case with the dormouse, which the regulations of the censors,\r\nand of M. Scaurus, the chief of the senate, when he was consul,[2115]\r\nhave banished from our tables,[2116] no less than shell-fish and\r\nbirds, which are brought from a foreign country. The dormouse is also\r\na half-wild animal, and the same person[2117] made warrens for them\r\nin large casks, who first formed parks for wild boars. In relation to\r\nthis subject, it has been remarked that dormice will not mate, unless\r\nthey happen to be natives of the same forest; and that if those are\r\nput together that are brought from different rivers or mountains, they\r\nwill fight and destroy each other. These animals nourish their parents,\r\nwhen worn out with old age, with a singular degree of affection. This\r\nold age of theirs is put an end to by their winter’s rest, when they\r\nconceal themselves and sleep; they are young again by the summer. The\r\nfield-mouse[2118] also enjoys a similar repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 83. (58.)—PLACES IN WHICH CERTAIN ANIMALS ARE NOT TO BE FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that nature has not only assigned different\r\ncountries to different animals, but that even in the same country,\r\nit has denied certain species to peculiar localities.[2119] In Italy\r\nthe dormouse is found in one part only, the Messian forest.[2120]\r\nIn Lycia the gazelle never passes beyond the mountains which border\r\nupon Syria;[2121] nor does the wild ass in that vicinity pass over\r\nthose which divide Cappadocia from Cilicia. On the banks of the\r\nHellespont, the stags never pass into a strange territory, and about\r\nArginussa[2122] they never go beyond Mount Elaphus; those upon that\r\nmountain, too, have cloven ears. In the island of Poroselene,[2123]\r\nthe weasels will not so much as cross a certain road. In Bœotia, the\r\nmoles, which were introduced at Lebadea, fly from the very soil of\r\nthat country, while in the neighbourhood, at Orchomenus, the very same\r\nanimals tear up all the fields. We have seen coverlets for beds made\r\nof the skins of these creatures, so that our sense of religion does\r\nnot prevent us from employing these ominous animals for the purposes\r\nof luxury. When hares have been brought to Ithaca, they die as soon\r\nas ever they touch the shore, and the same is the case with rabbits,\r\non the shores of the island of Ebusus;[2124] while they abound in the\r\nvicinity, Spain namely, and the Balearic isles. In Cyrene, the frogs\r\nwere formerly dumb, and this species still exists, although croaking\r\nones were carried over there from the continent. At the present day,\r\neven, the frogs in the island of Seriphos are dumb; but when they are\r\ncarried to other places, they croak; the same thing is also said to\r\nhave taken place at Sicandrus, a lake of Thessaly.[2125] In Italy, the\r\nbite of the shrew-mouse[2126] is venomous; an animal which is not to\r\nbe found in any region beyond the Apennines. In whatever country it\r\nexists, it always dies immediately if it goes across the rut made by\r\na wheel. Upon Olympus, a mountain of Macedonia, there are no wolves,\r\nnor yet in the isle of Crete.[2127] In this island there are neither\r\nfoxes, nor bears, nor, indeed, any kind of baneful animal,[2128] with\r\nthe exception of the phalangium, a species of spider, of which I\r\nshall speak in its appropriate place.[2129] It is a thing still more\r\nremarkable, that in this island there are no stags, except in the\r\ndistrict of Cydon;[2130] the same is the case with the wild boar, the\r\nwoodcock,[2131] and the hedgehog. In Africa, there are neither wild\r\nboars, stags, deer, nor bears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 84. (59.)—ANIMALS WHICH INJURE STRANGERS ONLY, AS ALSO ANIMALS\r\nWHICH INJURE THE NATIVES OF THE COUNTRY ONLY, AND WHERE THEY ARE FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides this, there are certain animals, which are harmless to the\r\nnatives of the country, but destroy strangers; such are the little\r\nserpents at Tirynthus,[2132] which are said to spring from out of the\r\nearth. In Syria, also, and especially on the banks of the Euphrates,\r\nthe serpents never attack the Syrians when they are asleep, and even if\r\nthey happen to bite a native who treads upon them, their venom is not\r\nfelt; but to persons of any other country they are extremely hostile,\r\nand fiercely attack them, causing a death attended with great torture.\r\nOn this account, the Syrians never kill them. On the contrary, on\r\nLatmos, a mountain[2133] of Caria, as Aristotle tells us, strangers are\r\nnot injured by the scorpions, while the natives are killed by them.\r\nBut I must now give an account of other animals as well, and of the\r\nproductions of the earth.[2134]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSummary.—Remarkable events, narratives, and observations, seven hundred\r\nand eighty-seven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoman authors quoted.—Mucianus,[2135] Procilius,[2136] Verrius\r\nFlaccus,[2137] L.

(1.)—WHY THE LARGEST ANIMALS ARE FOUND IN THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now given an account of the animals which we call terrestrial,\r\nand which live as it were in a sort of society with man. Among the\r\nremaining ones, it is well known that the birds are the smallest; we\r\nshall therefore first describe those which inhabit the seas, rivers,\r\nand standing waters.\r\n\r\n(2.) Among these there are many to be found that exceed in size any\r\nof the terrestrial animals even; the evident cause of which is the\r\nsuperabundance of moisture with which they are supplied. Very different\r\nis the lot of the winged animals, whose life is passed soaring aloft\r\nin the air. But in the seas, spread out as they are far and wide,\r\nforming an element at once so delicate and so vivifying, and receiving\r\nthe generating principles[2197] from the regions of the air, as they\r\nare ever produced by Nature, many animals are to be found, and indeed,\r\nmost of those that are of monstrous form; from the fact, no doubt, that\r\nthese seeds and first principles of being are so utterly conglomerated\r\nand so involved, the one with the other, from being whirled to and fro,\r\nnow by the action of the winds and now by the waves. Hence it is that\r\nthe vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced\r\nin any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well;\r\nwhile, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found\r\nwhich nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the\r\nforms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even,\r\nis easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine\r\nthe grape-fish,[2198] the sword-fish,[2199] the saw-fish,[2200] and the\r\ncucumber-fish,[2201] which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber\r\nboth in colour and in smell. We shall find the less reason then to be\r\nsurprised to find that in so small an object as a shell-fish[2202] the\r\nhead of the horse is to be seen protruding from the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (3.)—THE SEA MONSTERS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the most numerous and largest of all these animals are those\r\nfound in the Indian seas; among which there are balænae,[2203] four\r\njugera[2204] in extent, and the pristis,[2205] two hundred cubits\r\nlong: here also are found cray-fish[2206] four cubits in length, and\r\nin the river Ganges there are to be seen eels three hundred[2207]\r\nfeet long. But at sea it is more especially about the time of the\r\nsolstices that these monsters are to be seen. For then it is that in\r\nthese regions the whirlwind comes sweeping on, the rains descend, the\r\nhurricane comes rushing down, hurled from the mountain heights, while\r\nthe sea is stirred up from the very bottom, and the monsters are driven\r\nfrom their depths and rolled upwards on the crest of the billow. At\r\nother times again, there are such vast multitudes of tunnies met with,\r\nthat the fleet of Alexander the Great was able to make head against\r\nthem only by facing them in order of battle, just as it would have\r\ndone an enemy’s fleet. Had the ships not done this, but proceeded in a\r\nstraggling manner, they could not possibly have made their escape. No\r\nnoises, no sounds, no blows had any effect on these fish; by nothing\r\nshort of the clash of battle were they to be terrified, and by nothing\r\nless than their utter destruction were they overpowered.\r\n\r\nThere is a large peninsula in the Red Sea, known by the name of\r\nCadara:[2208] as it projects into the deep it forms a vast gulf, which\r\nit took the fleet of King Ptolemy[2209] twelve whole days and nights\r\nto traverse by dint of rowing, for not a breath of wind was to be\r\nperceived. In the recesses of this becalmed spot more particularly,\r\nthe sea-monsters attain so vast a size that they are quite unable\r\nto move. The commanders of the fleets of Alexander the Great have\r\nrelated that the Gedrosi,[2210] who dwell upon the banks of the river\r\nArabis,[2211] are in the habit of making the doors of their houses\r\nwith the jaw-bones[2212] of fishes, and raftering the roofs with their\r\nbones, many of which were found as much as forty cubits in length. At\r\nthis place, too, the sea-monsters, just like so many cattle,[2213]\r\nwere in the habit of coming on shore, and, after feeding on the roots\r\nof shrubs, they would return; some of them, which had the heads of\r\nhorses,[2214] asses, and bulls, found a pasture in the crops of grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (4.)—THE LARGEST ANIMALS THAT ARE FOUND IN EACH OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest animals found in the Indian Sea are the pistrix and the\r\nbalæna; while of the Gallic Ocean the physeter[2215] is the most bulky\r\ninhabitant, raising itself aloft like some vast column, and as it\r\ntowers above the sails of ships, belching forth, as it were, a deluge\r\nof water. In the ocean of Gades there is a tree,[2216] with outspread\r\nbranches so vast, that it is supposed that it is for that reason it\r\nhas never yet entered the Straits. There are fish also found there\r\nwhich are called sea-wheels,[2217] in consequence of their singular\r\nconformation; they are divided by four spokes, the nave being guarded\r\non every side by a couple of eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (5.)—THE FORMS OF THE TRITONS AND NEREIDS. THE FORMS OF SEA\r\nELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA deputation of persons from Olisipo,[2218] that had been sent for the\r\npurpose, brought word to the Emperor Tiberius that a triton had been\r\nboth seen and heard in a certain cavern, blowing a conch-shell,[2219]\r\nand of the form under which they are usually represented. Nor yet is\r\nthe figure generally attributed to the nereids[2220] at all a fiction;\r\nonly in them, the portion of the body that resembles the human figure\r\nis still rough all over with scales. For one of these creatures was\r\nseen upon the same shores, and as it died, its plaintive murmurs were\r\nheard even by the inhabitants at a distance. The legatus of Gaul,[2221]\r\ntoo, wrote word to the late Emperor Augustus that a considerable\r\nnumber of nereids had been found dead upon the sea-shore. I have, too,\r\nsome distinguished informants of equestrian rank, who state that they\r\nthemselves once saw in the ocean of Gades a sea-man,[2222] which bore\r\nin every part of his body a perfect resemblance to a human being, and\r\nthat during the night he would climb up into ships; upon which the side\r\nof the vessel where he seated himself would instantly sink downward,\r\nand if he remained there any considerable time, even go under water.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, a subsidence of the ocean\r\nleft exposed on the shores of an island which faces the province of\r\nLugdunum[2223] as many as three hundred animals or more, all at once,\r\nquite marvellous for their varied shapes and enormous size, and no less\r\na number upon the shores of the Santones;[2224] among the rest there\r\nwere elephants[2225] and rams, which last, however, had only a white\r\nspot to represent horns. Turranius has also left accounts of several\r\nnereids, and he speaks of a monster[2226] that was thrown up on the\r\nshore at Gades, the distance between the two fins at the end of the\r\ntail of which was sixteen cubits, and its teeth one hundred and twenty\r\nin number; the largest being nine, and the smallest six inches in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nM. Scaurus, in his ædileship, exhibited at Rome, among other wonderful\r\nthings, the bones of the monster to which Andromeda was said to have\r\nbeen exposed, and which he had brought from Joppa, a city of Judæa.\r\nThese bones exceeded forty feet in length, and the ribs were higher\r\nthan those of the Indian elephant, while the back-bone was a foot and a\r\nhalf[2227] in thickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (6.)—THE BALÆNA AND THE ORCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe balæna[2228] penetrates to our seas even. It is said that they are\r\nnot to be seen in the ocean of Gades before the winter solstice, and\r\nthat at periodical seasons they retire and conceal themselves in some\r\ncalm capacious bay, in which they take a delight in bringing forth.\r\nThis fact, however, is known to the orca,[2229] an animal which is\r\npeculiarly hostile to the balæna, and the form of which cannot be in\r\nany way adequately described, but as an enormous mass of flesh armed\r\nwith teeth. This animal attacks the balæna in its places of retirement,\r\nand with its teeth tears its young, or else attacks the females which\r\nhave just brought forth, and, indeed, while they are still pregnant;\r\nand as they rush upon them, it pierces them just as though they had\r\nbeen attacked by the beak of a Liburnian[2230] galley. The female\r\nbalænæ, devoid of all flexibility, without energy to defend themselves,\r\nand over-burdened by their own weight, weakened, too, by gestation, or\r\nelse the pains of recent parturition, are well aware that their only\r\nresource is to take to flight in the open sea and to range over the\r\nwhole face of the ocean; while the orcæ, on the other hand, do all in\r\ntheir power to meet them in their flight, throw themselves in their\r\nway, and kill them either cooped up in a narrow passage, or else drive\r\nthem on a shoal, or dash them to pieces against the rocks. When these\r\nbattles are witnessed, it appears just as though the sea were infuriate\r\nagainst itself; not a breath of wind is there to be felt in the bay,\r\nand yet the waves by their pantings and their repeated blows are heaved\r\naloft in a way which no whirlwind could effect.\r\n\r\nAn orca has been seen even in the port of Ostia, where it was attacked\r\nby the Emperor Claudius. It was while he was constructing the\r\nharbour[2231] there that this orca came, attracted by some hides which,\r\nhaving been brought from Gaul, had happened to fall overboard[2232]\r\nthere. By feeding upon these for several days it had quite glutted\r\nitself, having made for itself a channel in the shoaly water. Here,\r\nhowever, the sand was thrown up by the action of the wind to such an\r\nextent, that the creature found it quite impossible to turn round;\r\nand while in the act of pursuing its prey, it was propelled by the\r\nwaves towards the shore, so that its back came to be perceived above\r\nthe level of the water, very much resembling in appearance the keel\r\nof a vessel turned bottom upwards. Upon this, Cæsar ordered a great\r\nnumber of nets to be extended at the mouth of the harbour, from shore\r\nto shore, while he himself went there with the prætorian cohorts, and\r\nso afforded a spectacle to the Roman people; for boats assailed the\r\nmonster, while the soldiers on board showered lances upon it. I myself\r\nsaw one of the boats[2233] sunk by the water which the animal, as it\r\nrespired, showered down upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—WHETHER FISHES RESPIRE, AND WHETHER THEY SLEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalænæ have the mouth[2234] in the forehead; and hence it is that, as\r\nthey swim on the surface of the water, they discharge vast showers of\r\nwater in the air. (7.) It is universally agreed, however, that they\r\nrespire, as do a very few other animals[2235] in the sea, which have\r\nlungs among the internal viscera; for without lungs it is generally\r\nsupposed that no animal can breathe. Those, too, who are of this\r\nopinion are of opinion also that no fishes that have gills are so\r\nconstituted as to inhale and exhale alternately, nor, in fact, many\r\nother kinds of animals even, which are entirely destitute of gills.\r\nThis, I find, was the opinion of Aristotle,[2236] who, by his learned\r\nresearches[2237] on the subject, has induced many others to be of the\r\nsame way of thinking. I shall not, however, conceal the fact, that I\r\nfor one do not by any means at once subscribe to this opinion, for it\r\nis very possible, if such be the will of Nature, that there may be\r\nother organs[2238] fitted for the purposes of respiration, and acting\r\nin the place of lungs; just as in many animals a different liquid\r\naltogether takes the place of blood.[2239] And who, in fact, can find\r\nany ground for surprise that the breath of life can penetrate the\r\nwaters of the deep, when he sees that it is even exhaled[2240] from\r\nthem? and when we find, too, that it can even enter the very depths\r\nof the earth, an element of so much greater density, a thing that is\r\nproved by the case of animals which always live under ground, the mole\r\nfor instance? There are other weighty reasons as well, which induce me\r\nto be of opinion that all aquatic animals respire, conformably to their\r\nnatural organization; for, in the first place, there has been often\r\nremarked in fishes a certain degree of anhelation during the heat of\r\nsummer, and at other times again, a kind of leisurely gaping,[2241] as\r\nit were. And then, besides, we have the admission of those who are of\r\nthe contrary opinion, that fishes do sleep; but what possibility is\r\nthere of sleeping[2242] without respiring as well? And again, we see\r\ntheir breath disengaged in bubbles which rise to the water’s surface,\r\nand the influence too of the moon makes even the very shells[2243] grow\r\nin bulk.\r\n\r\nBut the most convincing reason of all is, the undoubted fact that\r\nfishes have the power of hearing[2244] and of smelling, two senses for\r\nthe operation of both of which the air is a necessary vehicle; for\r\nby smell we understand nothing else than the air being charged with\r\ncertain particles.[2245] However, let every person form his own opinion\r\non these subjects, just in such way as he may think best.\r\n\r\nNeither the balæna nor the dolphin has any gills.[2246] Both of these\r\nanimals respire[2247] through vent-holes, which communicate with the\r\nlungs; in the balæna they are on the forehead,[2248] and in the dolphin\r\non the back. Sea-calves, too, which we call “phocæ,”[2249] breathe and\r\nsleep upon dry land—sea-tortoises also,[2250] of which we shall have\r\nmore to say hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (8.)—DOLPHINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe swiftest[2251] not only of the sea animals, but of all animals\r\nwhatever, is the dolphin.[2252] He is more rapid in his movements than\r\na bird, more instantaneous than the flight of an arrow, and were it not\r\nfor the fact that his month is situate much below his muzzle,[2253]\r\nalmost, indeed, in the middle of the belly, not a fish would be able\r\nto escape his pursuit. But Nature,[2254] in her prudence, has thrown\r\ncertain impediments in his way; for unless he turns, and throws himself\r\non his back, he can seize nothing, and it is this circumstance more\r\nespecially that gives proof of his extraordinary swiftness. For, if\r\npressed by hunger,[2255] he will follow a fish, as it flies down, to\r\nthe very bottom of the water, and then after holding his breath thus\r\nlong, will dart again to the surface to respire, with the speed of an\r\narrow discharged from a bow; and often, on such occasions, he is known\r\nto leap out of the water with such a bound, as to fly right over the\r\nsails[2256] of a ship.\r\n\r\nDolphins generally go in couples; the females bring forth their\r\nyoung in the tenth month, during the summer season, sometimes two in\r\nnumber.[2257] They suckle their young at the teat like the balæna, and\r\neven carry them during the weakness of infancy; in addition to which,\r\nlong after they are grown up, they accompany them, so great is their\r\naffection for their progeny. The young ones grow very speedily, and\r\nin ten years are supposed to arrive at their full size. The dolphin\r\nlives thirty years; a fact that has been ascertained from cutting\r\nmarks[2258] on the tail, by way of experiment. It conceals itself for\r\nthirty days, at about the rising of the Dog-star, and hides itself so\r\neffectually, that it is not known whither it goes; a thing that is more\r\nsurprising still, if it is unable to respire under water. Dolphins are\r\nin the habit of darting upon the shore, for some reason or other, it is\r\nnot known[2259] what. They do not die the moment that they touch the\r\ndry land, but will die much more speedily if the vent-hole is closed.\r\nThe tongue, contrary to the nature of aquatic animals in general, is\r\nmoveable, being short and broad, not much unlike that of the pig.\r\nInstead of a voice, they emit a moaning sound[2260] similar to that\r\nmade by a human being; the back is arched, and the nose turned up. For\r\nthis reason[2261] it is that they all recognize in a most surprising\r\nmanner the name of Simo, and prefer to be called by that rather than by\r\nany other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAVE BEEN BELOVED BY DOLPHINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dolphin is an animal not only friendly to man, but a lover of\r\nmusic as well; he is charmed by melodious concerts,[2262] and more\r\nespecially by the notes of the water-organ.[2263] He does not dread\r\nman, as though a stranger to him, but comes to meet ships, leaps and\r\nbounds to and fro, vies with them in swiftness, and passes them even\r\nwhen in full sail.\r\n\r\nIn the reign[2264] of the late Emperor Augustus, a dolphin which had\r\nbeen carried to the Lucrine Lake[2265] conceived a most wonderful\r\naffection for the child of a certain poor man, who was in the habit of\r\ngoing that way from Baiæ to Puteoli[2266] to school, and who used to\r\nstop there in the middle of the day, call him by his name of Simo, and\r\nwould often entice him to the banks of the lake with pieces of bread\r\nwhich he carried for the purpose. I should really have felt ashamed to\r\nmention this, had not the incident been stated in writing in the works\r\nof Mæcenas, Fabianus, Flavius Alfius, and many others. At whatever\r\nhour of the day he might happen to be called by the boy, and although\r\nhidden and out of sight at the bottom of the water, he would instantly\r\nfly to the surface, and after feeding from his hand, would present his\r\nback for him to mount, taking care to conceal the spiny projection of\r\nhis fins[2267] in their sheath, as it were; and so, sportively taking\r\nhim up on his back, he would carry him over a wide expanse of sea to\r\nthe school at Puteoli, and in a similar manner bring him back again.\r\nThis happened for several years, until at last the boy happened to fall\r\nill of some malady, and died. The dolphin, however, still came to the\r\nspot as usual, with a sorrowful air and manifesting every sign of deep\r\naffliction, until at last, a thing of which no one felt the slightest\r\ndoubt, he died purely of sorrow and regret.\r\n\r\nWithin these few years also,[2268] another at Hippo Diarrhytus,[2269]\r\non the coast of Africa, in a similar manner used to receive his food\r\nfrom the hands of various persons, present himself for their caresses,\r\nsport about among the swimmers, and carry them on his back. On being\r\nrubbed with unguents by Flavianus, the then proconsul of Africa, he\r\nwas lulled to sleep, as it appeared, by the sensation of an odour so\r\nnew to him, and floated about just as though he had been dead. For\r\nsome months after this, he carefully avoided all intercourse with man,\r\njust as though he had received some affront or other; but at the end\r\nof that time he returned, and afforded just the same wonderful scenes\r\nas before. At last, the vexations that were caused them by having to\r\nentertain so many influential men who came to see this sight, compelled\r\nthe people of Hippo to put the animal to death.\r\n\r\nBefore this, there was a similar story told of a child at the city of\r\nIasus,[2270] for whom a dolphin was long observed to have conceived\r\na most ardent affection, until at last, as the animal was eagerly\r\nfollowing him as he was making for the shore,[2271] it was carried by\r\nthe tide on the sands, and there expired. Alexander the Great appointed\r\nthis boy[2272] high priest of Neptune at Babylon, interpreting this\r\nextraordinary attachment as a convincing proof of the favour of that\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\nHegesidemus has also informed us, that in the same city[2273] of Iasus\r\nthere was another boy also, Hermias by name, who in a similar manner\r\nused to traverse the sea on a dolphin’s back, but that on one occasion\r\na tempest suddenly arising, he lost his life, and was brought back\r\ndead; upon which, the dolphin, who thus admitted that he had been the\r\ncause of his death, would not return to the sea, but lay down upon the\r\ndry land, and there expired.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus[2274] informs us, that the very same thing happened at\r\nNaupactus also; nor, in fact, is there any limit to similar instances.\r\nThe Amphilochians[2275] and the Tarentines[2276] have similar\r\nstories also about children and dolphins; and all these give an air\r\nof credibility to the one that is told of Arion,[2277] the famous\r\nperformer on the lyre. The mariners being on the point of throwing him\r\ninto the sea, for the purpose of taking possession of the money he had\r\nearned, he prevailed upon them to allow him one more song, accompanied\r\nwith the music of his lyre. The melody attracted numbers of dolphins\r\naround the ship, and, upon throwing himself into the sea, he was taken\r\nup by one of them, and borne in safety to the shore of the Promontory\r\nof Tænarum.[2278]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—PLACES WHERE DOLPHINS HELP MEN TO FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is in the province of Gallia Narbonensis and in the territory of\r\nNemausus[2279] a lake known by the name of Latera,[2280] where dolphins\r\nfish in company with men. At the narrow outlet[2281] of this lake, at\r\nstated seasons of the year innumerable multitudes of mullets make their\r\nway into the sea, taking advantage of the turn of the tide; hence it\r\nis that it is quite impossible to employ nets sufficiently strong to\r\nbear so vast a weight, even though the fish had not the instinctive\r\nshrewdness to watch their opportunity. By a similar instinct the fish\r\nimmediately make with all speed towards the deep water which is found\r\nin a gulf in that vicinity, and hasten to escape from the only spot\r\nthat is at all convenient for spreading the nets. As soon as ever the\r\nfishermen perceive this, all the people—for great multitudes resort\r\nthither, being well aware of the proper time, and especially desirous\r\nof sharing in the amusement—shout as loud as they can, and summon Simo\r\nto the scene of action. The dolphins very quickly understand that\r\nthey are in requisition, as a north-east wind speedily carries the\r\nsound to their retreats, though a south one would somewhat retard it\r\nby carrying it in an opposite direction. Even then however, sooner\r\nthan you could have possibly supposed, there are the dolphins, in all\r\nreadiness to assist. They are seen approaching in all haste in battle\r\narray, and, immediately taking up their position when the engagement\r\nis about to take place, they cut off all escape to the open sea, and\r\ndrive the terrified fish into shallow water. The fishermen then throw\r\ntheir nets, holding them up at the sides with forks, though the mullets\r\nwith inconceivable agility instantly leap over them;[2282] while\r\nthe dolphins, on the other hand, are waiting in readiness to receive\r\nthem, and content themselves for the present with killing them only,\r\npostponing all thoughts of eating till after they have secured the\r\nvictory. The battle waxes hot apace, and the dolphins, pressing on with\r\nthe greatest vigour, readily allow themselves to be enclosed in the\r\nnets; but in order that the fact of their being thus enclosed may not\r\nurge the enemy to find additional means of flight, they glide along so\r\nstealthily among the boats and nets, or else the swimmers, as not to\r\nleave them any opening for escape. By leaping, which at other times is\r\ntheir most favourite amusement, not one among them attempts to make\r\nits escape, unless, indeed, the nets are purposely lowered for it; and\r\nthe instant that it has come out it continues the battle, as it were,\r\nup to the very ramparts. At last, when the capture is now completed,\r\nthey devour those among the fish which they have killed;[2283] but\r\nbeing well aware that they have given too active an assistance to be\r\nrepaid with only one day’s reward, they take care to wait there till\r\nthe following day, when they are filled not only with fish, but bread\r\ncrumbs soaked in wine as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS RELATING TO DOLPHINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe account which Mucianus gives of a similar mode of fishing in the\r\nIasian Gulf differs from the preceding one, in the fact that there the\r\ndolphins make their appearance of their own accord, and do not require\r\nto be called: they receive their share from the hands of the people,\r\neach boat having its own particular associate among the dolphins;\r\nand this, although the fishing is carried on at night-time by the\r\nlight[2284] of torches.\r\n\r\nDolphins, also, form among themselves[2285] a sort of general\r\ncommunity. One of them having been captured by a king of Caria and\r\nchained up in the harbour, great multitudes of dolphins assembled at\r\nthe spot, and with signs of sorrow which could not be misunderstood,\r\nappealed to the sympathies of the people, until at last the king\r\nordered it to be released. The young dolphins, also, are always\r\nattended[2286] by a larger one, who acts as a guardian to them; and\r\nbefore now, they have been seen[2287] carrying off the body of one\r\nwhich had died, that it might not be devoured by the sea-monsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (9.)—THE TURSIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a fish called the tursio,[2288] which bears a strong\r\nresemblance to the dolphin; it differs from it, however, in a certain\r\nair of sadness, and is wanting in its peculiar vivacity. This animal\r\nmost resembles the dog-fish,[2289] however, in the shape and dangerous\r\npowers of the muzzle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (10.)—TURTLES.[2290] THE VARIOUS KINDS OF TURTLES, AND HOW\r\nTHEY ARE CAUGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian Sea[2291] produces turtles of such vast[2292] size, that\r\nwith the shell of a single animal they are able to roof a habitable\r\ncottage;[2293] and among the islands of the Red Sea, the navigation\r\nis mostly carried on in boats formed of these shells. They are to be\r\ncaught in many ways; but they are generally taken when they have come\r\nup to the surface of the water just before midday, a season at which\r\nthey experience great delight in floating on the calm surface, with the\r\nback entirely out of the water. Here the delightful sensations[2294]\r\nwhich attend a free respiration beguile them to such a degree, and\r\nrender them so utterly regardless of their safety, that their shell\r\nbecomes dried up by the heat of the sun, so much so, indeed, that they\r\nare unable to descend, and, having to float against their will, become\r\nan easy prey to the fishermen. It is said also, that they leave the\r\nwater at night for the purpose of feeding, and eat with such avidity as\r\nto quite glut themselves: upon which, they become weary, and the moment\r\nthat, on their return in the morning, they reach the sea, they fall\r\nasleep on the surface of the water. The noise of their snoring betrays\r\nthem, upon which the fishermen stealthily swim towards the animals,\r\nthree to each turtle; two of them, in a moment, throw it on its back,\r\nwhile a third slings a noose around it, as it lies face upwards, and\r\nthen some more men, who are ready on shore, draw it to land.\r\n\r\nIn the Phœnician Sea they are taken without the slightest difficulty,\r\nand, at stated periods of the year, come of their own accord to the\r\nriver Eleutherus,[2295] in immense numbers. The turtle has no teeth,\r\nbut the edge of the mouth is sharp, the upper part shutting down\r\nover the lower just like the lid of a box. In the sea it lives upon\r\nshell-fish,[2296] and such is the strength of its jaws, that it is able\r\nto break stones even; when on shore, it feeds upon herbage. The female\r\nturtle lays eggs like those of birds, one hundred in number; these she\r\nburies on the dry land, and covering them over with earth, pats it\r\ndown with her breast, and then having thus rendered it smooth, sits on\r\nthem during the night. The young are hatched in the course of a year.\r\nSome persons are of opinion that they hatch their eggs by means of the\r\neyes, by merely looking at them, and that the female refuses to have\r\nany intercourse with the male until he has placed a wisp of straw[2297]\r\nupon her back. The Troglodytæ have turtles with horns,[2298] which\r\nresemble the branches of a lyre; they are large, but moveable, and\r\nassist the animal like so many oars while swimming. The name of this\r\nfine, but rarely-found turtle, is “chelyon;”[2299] for the rocks, from\r\nthe sharpness of their points, frighten away the Chelonophagi,[2300]\r\nwhile the Troglodytæ, whose shores these animals frequent, worship\r\nthem as sacred. There are some land turtles also, the shells of\r\nwhich, used for the purposes of art, are thence called by the name of\r\n“chersinæ;”[2301] they are found in the deserts of Africa, in the parts\r\nwhere the scorched sands are more especially destitute of water, and\r\nsubsist, it is believed, upon the moisture of the dews. No other animal\r\nis to be found there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (11.)—WHO FIRST INVENTED THE ART OF CUTTING TORTOISE-SHELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarvilius Pollio, a man of prodigal habits and ingenious in inventing\r\nthe refinements of luxury, was the first to cut the shell of the\r\ntortoise into laminæ, and to veneer beds and cabinets[2302] with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (12.)—DISTRIBUTION OF AQUATIC ANIMALS INTO VARIOUS SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe integuments of the aquatic animals are many in number. Some are\r\ncovered with a hide and hair, as the sea-calf and hippopotamus, for\r\ninstance; others again, with a hide only, as the dolphin; others again,\r\nwith a shell,[2303] as the turtle; others, with a coat as hard as a\r\nstone, like the oyster and other shell-fish; others, with a crust, such\r\nas the cray-fish; others, with a crust and spines, like the sea-urchin;\r\nothers, with scales, as fishes in general; others, with a rough skin,\r\nas the squatina,[2304] the skin of which is used for polishing wood and\r\nivory; others, with a soft skin, like the muræna;[2305] and others with\r\nnone at all, like the polypus.[2306]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (13.)—THOSE WHICH ARE COVERED WITH HAIR, OR HAVE NONE, AND\r\nHOW THEY BRING FORTH. SEA-CALVES, OR PHOCÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose aquatic animals which are covered with hair are viviparous, such,\r\nfor instance, as the pristis, the balæna,[2307] and the sea-calf. This\r\nlast brings forth its young on land, and, like the sheep, produces an\r\nafter-birth. In coupling, they adhere after the manner of the canine\r\nspecies; the female sometimes produces even more than two, and rears\r\nher young at the breast. She does not take them down to the sea until\r\nthe twelfth day, and after that time makes them become used to it by\r\ndegrees.[2308] These animals are killed with the greatest difficulty,\r\nunless the head is cut off at once. They make a noise which sounds\r\nlike lowing, whence their name of “sea-calf.” They are susceptible,\r\nhowever, of training, and with their voice, as well as by gestures,\r\ncan be taught to salute the public; when called by their name, they\r\nanswer with a discordant kind of grunt.[2309] No animal has a deeper\r\nsleep[2310] than this; on dry land it creeps along as though on feet,\r\nby the aid of what it uses as fins when in the sea. Its skin, even\r\nwhen separated from the body, is said to retain a certain sensitive\r\nsympathy with the sea, and at the reflux[2311] of the tide, the hair on\r\nit always rises upright: in addition to which, it is said that there is\r\nin the right fin a certain soporiferous influence, and that, if placed\r\nunder the head, it induces sleep.\r\n\r\n(14.) There are only two animals without hair that are viviparous, the\r\ndolphin and the viper.[2312]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—HOW MANY KINDS OF FISH THERE ARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are seventy-four[2313] species of fishes, exclusive of those\r\nthat are covered with crusts; the kinds of which are thirty in number.\r\nWe shall, on another occasion,[2314] speak of each individually;\r\nbut, for the present, we shall treat only of the nature of the more\r\nremarkable ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (15.)—WHICH OF THE FISHES ARE OF THE LARGEST SIZE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTunnies are among the most remarkable for their size; we have found\r\none weighing as much as fifteen[2315] talents, the breadth of its tail\r\nbeing five cubits and a palm.[2316] In some of the rivers, also, there\r\nare fish of no less size, such, for instance, as the silurus[2317] of\r\nthe Nile, the isox[2318] of the Rhenus, and the attilus[2319] of the\r\nPadus, which, naturally of an inactive nature, sometimes grows so fat\r\nas to weigh a thousand pounds, and when taken with a hook, attached to\r\na chain, requires a yoke of oxen to draw it[2320] on land. An extremely\r\nsmall fish, which is known as the clupea,[2321] attaches itself, with\r\na wonderful tenacity, to a certain vein in the throat of the attilus,\r\nand destroys it by its bite. The silurus carries devastation with\r\nit wherever it goes, attacks every living creature, and often drags\r\nbeneath the water horses as they swim. It is also remarkable, that in\r\nthe Mœnus,[2322] a river of Germany, a fish that bears[2323] a very\r\nstrong resemblance to the sea-pig, requires to be drawn out of the\r\nwater by a yoke of oxen; and, in the Danube, it is taken with large\r\nhooks of iron.[2324] In the Boryrsthenes, also, there is said to be a\r\nfish of enormous size, the flesh of which has no bones or spines in it,\r\nand is remarkable for its sweetness.\r\n\r\nIn the Granges, a river of India, there is a fish found which they call\r\nthe platanista;[2325] it has the muzzle and the tail of the dolphin,\r\nand measures sixteen cubits in length. Statius Sebosus says, a thing\r\nthat is marvellous in no small degree, that in the same river there are\r\nfishes[2326] found, called worms; these have two gills,[2327] and are\r\nsixty cubits in length; they are of an azure colour, and have received\r\ntheir name from their peculiar conformation. These fish, he says, are\r\nof such enormous strength, that with their teeth they seize hold of the\r\ntrunks of elephants that come to drink, and so drag them into the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—TUNNIES, CORDYLA, AND PELAMIDES, AND THE VARIOUS PARTS OF\r\nTHEM THAT ARE SALTED. MELANDRYA, APOLECTI, AND CYBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe male tunny has no ventral fin;[2328] these fish enter the Euxine\r\nin large bodies from the main[2329] sea, in the spring, and will spawn\r\nnowhere else. The young ones, which in autumn accompany the females\r\nto the open sea, are known as “cordyla.”[2330] In the spring they are\r\ncalled “pelamides,”[2331] from πηλὸς, the Greek for “mud,” and after\r\nthey are a year old, “thynni.” When this fish is cut up into pieces,\r\nthe neck, the belly, and the throat,[2332] are the most esteemed parts;\r\nbut they must be eaten only when they are quite fresh, and even then\r\nthey cause severe fits of flatulence; the other parts; with the flesh\r\nentire, are preserved in salt. Those pieces, which bear a resemblance\r\nto an oaken board, have thence received the name of “melandrya.”[2333]\r\nThe least esteemed among these parts are those which are the nearest\r\nto the tail, because they have no fat upon them; while those parts\r\nare considered the most delicate, which lie nearest the neck;[2334]\r\nin other fishes, however, the parts about the tail have the most\r\nnutriment[2335] in them. The pelamides are cut up into small sections,\r\nknown as “apolecti;”[2336] and these again are divided into cubical\r\npieces, which are thence called “cybia.”[2337]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—THE AURIAS AND THE SCOMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll kinds of fish grow[2338] with remarkable rapidity, and more\r\nespecially those in the Euxine; the reason[2339] of which is the\r\nvast number of rivers which discharge their fresh water into it. One\r\nfish, the growth of which is quite perceptible, day by day, is known\r\nas the amia.[2340] This fish, and the pelamides, together with the\r\ntunnies,[2341] enter the Euxine in shoals, for the purpose of obtaining\r\na sweeter nutriment, each under the command of its own leader; but\r\nfirst of all the scomber[2342] appears, which is of a sulphureous tint\r\nwhen in the water, but when out of it resembles other fish in colour.\r\nThe salt-water preserves[2343] of Spain are filled with these last\r\nfish, but the tunnies do not consort with them.[2344]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—FISHES WHICH ARE NEVER FOUND IN THE EUXINE; THOSE WHICH ENTER\r\nIT AND RETURN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Euxine, however, is never entered by any animal[2345] that is\r\nnoxious to fish, with the exception of the sea-calf and the small\r\ndolphin. On entering, the tunnies range along[2346] the shores to the\r\nright, and on departing, keep to those on the left; this is supposed\r\nto arise from the fact that they have better sight with the right eye,\r\ntheir powers of vision with either being naturally very limited. In the\r\nchannel of the Thracian Bosporus, by which the Propontis is connected\r\nwith the Euxine, at the narrowest part of the Straits which separate\r\nEurope from Asia, there is, near Chalcedon, on the Asiatic side, a rock\r\nof remarkable whiteness, the whole of which can be seen from the bottom\r\nof the sea at the surface. Alarmed at the sudden appearance of this\r\nrock, the tunnies always hasten in great numbers, and with headlong\r\nimpetuosity, towards the promontory of Byzantium, which stands exactly\r\nopposite to it, and from this circumstance has received the name of the\r\nGolden Horn.[2347] Hence it is, that all the fishing is at Byzantium,\r\nto the great loss of Chalcedon,[2348] although it is only separated\r\nfrom it by a channel a mile in width. They wait, however, for the\r\nblowing of the north wind to leave the Euxine with a favourable tide,\r\nand are never taken until they have entered the harbour of Byzantium.\r\nThese fish do not move about in winter;[2349] in whatever place they\r\nmay happen to be surprised by it, there they pass the winter, till the\r\ntime of the equinox.\r\n\r\nManifesting a wonderful degree of delight, they will often accompany\r\na vessel in full sail, and may be seen from the poop following it\r\nfor hours, and a distance of several miles. If a fish-spear even is\r\nthrown at them ever so many times, they are not in the slightest degree\r\nalarmed at it. Some writers call the tunnies which follow ships in this\r\nmanner, by the name of “pompili.”[2350]\r\n\r\nMany fishes pass the summer in the Propontis, and do not enter the\r\nEuxine; such, for instance, as the sole,[2351] while on the other\r\nhand, the turbot[2352] enters it. The sepia[2353] is not found in\r\nthis sea, although the loligo[2354] is. Among the rock-fish, the\r\nsea-thrush[2355] and the sea-blackbird are wanting, as also purples,\r\nthough oysters abound here. All these, however, pass the winter in\r\nthe Ægean Sea; and of those which enter the Euxine, the only ones\r\nthat do not[2356] return are the trichiæ.[2357]—It will be as well to\r\nuse the Greek names which most of them bear, seeing that to the same\r\nspecies different countries have given different appellations.—These\r\nlast, however, are the only ones that enter the river Ister,[2358] and\r\npassing along its subterraneous passages, make their way from it to\r\nthe Adriatic;[2359] and this is the reason why they are to be seen\r\ndescending into the Euxine Sea, but never in the act of returning\r\nfrom it. The time for taking tunnies is, from the rising of the\r\nVergiliæ[2360] to the setting of Arcturus:[2361] throughout the rest\r\nof the winter season, they lie concealed at the bottom of deep creeks,\r\nunless they are induced to come out by the warmth of the weather or the\r\nfull moon. These fish fatten[2362] to such an extraordinary degree as\r\nto burst. The longest period of their life[2363] is two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—WHY FISHES LEAP ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a little animal,[2364] in appearance like a scorpion, and\r\nof the size of a spider.[2365] This creature, by means of its sting,\r\nattaches itself below the fin to the tunny and the fish known as the\r\nsword-fish[2366] and which often exceeds the dolphin in magnitude, and\r\ncauses it such excruciating pain, that it will often leap on board of\r\na ship even. Fish will also do the same at other times, when in dread\r\nof the violence of other fish, and mullets more especially, which are\r\nof such extraordinary swiftness, that they will sometimes leap over a\r\nship, if lying crosswise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (16.)—THAT AUGURIES ARE DERIVED FROM FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuguries are also derived from this department of Nature, and fishes\r\nafford presages of coming events. While Augustus[2367] was walking on\r\nthe sea-shore, during the time of the Sicilian war, a fish leapt out of\r\nthe sea, and fell at his feet. The diviners, who were consulted, stated\r\nthat this was a proof that those would fall beneath the feet of Cæsar\r\nwho at that moment were in possession of the seas—it was just at this\r\ntime that Sextus Pompeius had adopted[2368] Neptune as his father, so\r\nelated was he with his successes by sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—WHAT KINDS OF FISHES HAVE NO MALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe females of fishes are larger[2369] in size than the males, and in\r\nsome kinds there are no males[2370] at all, as in the erythini[2371]\r\nand the channi;[2372] for all of these that are taken are found to be\r\nfull of eggs. Nearly all kinds of fish that are covered with scales\r\nare gregarious. They are most easily taken before sunrise;[2373] for\r\nthen more particularly their powers of seeing are defective. They sleep\r\nduring the night; and when the weather is clear, are able to see just\r\nas well then as during the day. It is said, also, that it greatly tends\r\nto promote their capture to drag the bottom of the water, and that by\r\nso doing more are taken at the second haul[2374] than at the first.\r\nThey are especially fond of the taste of oil, and find nutriment in\r\ngentle showers of rain. Indeed, the very reeds,[2375] even, although\r\nthey are produced in swamps, will not grow to maturity without the\r\naid of rain: in addition to this, we find that wherever fishes remain\r\nconstantly in the same water, if it is not renewed they will die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—FISHES WHICH HAVE A STONE IN THE HEAD; THOSE WHICH KEEP\r\nTHEMSELVES CONCEALED DURING WINTER; AND THOSE WHICH ARE NOT TAKEN IN\r\nWINTER, EXCEPT UPON STATED DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll fish have a presentiment of a rigorous winter, but more especially\r\nthose which are supposed to have a stone[2376] in the head, the\r\nlupus,[2377] for instance, the chromis,[2378] the sciæna,[2379] and\r\nthe phagrus.[2380] When the winter has been very severe, many fish\r\nare taken in a state of blindness.[2381] Hence it is, that during\r\nthese months they lie concealed in holes, in the same manner as land\r\nanimals, as we have already[2382] mentioned; and more especially the\r\nhippurus,[2383] and the coracinus,[2384] which are never taken during\r\nthe winter, except only on a few stated days, which are always the\r\nsame. The same with the muræna[2385] also, and the orphus,[2386] the\r\nconger,[2387] the perch,[2388] and all the rock-fish. It is said\r\nthat, during the winter, the torpedo,[2389] the psetta,[2390] and the\r\nsole, conceal themselves in the earth, or rather, I should say, in\r\nexcavations made by them at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—FISHES WHICH CONCEAL THEMSELVES DURING THE SUMMER; THOSE\r\nWHICH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther fishes,[2391] again, are unable to bear the heat of summer,\r\nand lie concealed during the sixty days of the hottest weather\r\nof midsummer; such, for instance, as the glaucus,[2392] the\r\nasellus,[2393] and the dorade.[2394] Among the river-fish, the\r\nsilurus[2395] is affected by the rising of the Dog-star, and at other\r\ntimes it is always sent to sleep by thunder. The same is also believed\r\nto be the case with the sea-fish called cyprinus.[2396] In addition\r\nto this, the whole sea is sensible[2397] of the rising of this star,\r\na thing which is more especially to be observed in the Bosporus: for\r\nthere sea-weeds and fish are seen floating on the surface, all of which\r\nhave been thrown up from the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26. (17.)—THE MULLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne singular propensity of the mullet[2398] has afforded a subject\r\nfor laughter;[2399] when it is frightened, it hides its head, and\r\nfancies that the whole of its body is concealed. Their salacious\r\npropensities[2400] render them so unguarded, that in Phœnicia and in\r\nthe province of Gallia Narbonensis, at the time of coupling, a male,\r\nbeing taken from out of the preserves, is fastened to a long line,\r\nwhich is passed through his mouth and gills; he is then let go in the\r\nsea, after which he is drawn back again by the line, upon which the\r\nfemales will follow him to the very water’s edge; and so, on the other\r\nhand, the male will follow the female, during the spawning season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—THE ACIPENSER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, the acipenser[2401] was esteemed the most noble\r\nfish of all; it is the only one that has the scales turned towards the\r\nhead, and in a contrary direction to that in which it swims. At the\r\npresent day, however, it is held in no esteem, which I am the more\r\nsurprised at, it being so very rarely found. Some writers call this\r\nfish the elops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—THE LUPUS, ASELLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a later period, they set the highest value on the lupus[2402] and\r\nthe asellus,[2403] as we learn from Cornelius Nepos, and the poet,\r\nLaberius, the author of the Mimes. The most approved kinds of the lupus\r\nare those which have the name of “lanati,” or “woolly,” in consequence\r\nof the extreme whiteness and softness of the flesh. Of the asellus\r\nthere are two sorts, the callarias, which is the smallest, and the\r\nbacchus,[2404] which is only taken in deep water, and is hence much\r\npreferred to the former. On the other hand, among the varieties of the\r\nlupus, those are the most esteemed which are taken in rivers. CHAP.\r\n29.—THE SCARUS, THE MUSTELA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present day, the first place is given to the scarus,[2405] the\r\nonly fish that is said to ruminate, and to feed on grass and not on\r\nother fish. It is mostly found in the Carpathian Sea, and never of\r\nits own accord passes Lectum,[2406] a promontory of Troas. Optatus\r\nElipertius, the commander of the fleet under the Emperor Claudius, had\r\nthis fish brought from that locality, and dispersed in various places\r\noff the coast between Ostia and the districts of Campania. During five\r\nyears, the greatest care was taken that those which were caught should\r\nbe returned to the sea; but since then they have been always found in\r\ngreat abundance off the shores of Italy, where formerly there were none\r\nto be taken. Thus has gluttony introduced these fish, to be a dainty\r\nwithin its reach, and added a new inhabitant to the seas; so that we\r\nought to feel no surprise that foreign birds breed at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe fish that is next in estimation for the table is the mustela,[2407]\r\nbut that is valued only for its liver. A singular thing to tell of—the\r\nlake of Brigantia,[2408] in Rhætia, lying in the midst of the Alps,\r\nproduces them to rival even those of the sea.[2409]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MULLETS, AND THE SARGUS THAT ATTENDS\r\nTHEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the remaining fish that are held in any degree of esteem, the\r\nmullet[2410] is the most highly valued, as well as the most abundant\r\nof all; it is of only a moderate size, rarely exceeds two pounds\r\nin weight, and will never grow beyond that weight in preserves\r\nor fish-ponds. These fish are only to be found in the Northern\r\nOcean,[2411] exceeding two pounds in weight, and even there in none\r\nbut the more westerly parts. As for the other kinds, the various\r\nspecies are numerous; some[2412] live upon sea-weed, while others\r\nfeed on the oyster, slime, and the flesh of other fish. The more\r\ndistinctive mark is a forked beard, that projects beneath the lower\r\nlip. The lutarius,[2413] or mud-mullet, is held in the lowest esteem\r\nof all. This last is always accompanied[2414] by another fish, known\r\nas the sargus, and where the mullet stirs up the mud, the other finds\r\naliment for its own sustenance. The mullet that is found on the coast\r\nis not[2415] highly esteemed, and the most esteemed of all have a\r\nstrong flavour[2416] of shell-fish. Fenestella is of opinion, that this\r\nfish received its name of mullet [mullus] from its resemblance to the\r\ncolour of the red or mullet-coloured shoes.[2417] The mullet spawns\r\nthree[2418] times a year: at all events, the fry makes its appearance\r\nthat number of times. The masters in gastronomy inform us, that the\r\nmullet, while dying, assumes a variety of colours and a succession of\r\nshades, and that the hue of the red scales, growing paler and paler,\r\ngradually changes, more especially if it is looked at enclosed in\r\nglass.[2419] M. Apicius, a man who displayed a remarkable degree of\r\ningenuity in everything relating to luxury, was of opinion, that it\r\nwas a most excellent plan to let the mullet die in the pickle known as\r\nthe “garum of the allies”[2420]—for we find that even this has found\r\na surname—and he proposed a prize for any one who should invent a new\r\nsauce,[2421] made from the liver of this fish. I find it much easier to\r\nrelate this fact, than to state who it was that gained the prize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—ENORMOUS PRICES OF SOME FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsinius Celer,[2422] a man of consular rank, and remarkable for his\r\nprodigal expenditure on this fish, bought one at Rome, during the\r\nreign of Caius,[2423] at the price of eight thousand sesterces.[2424]\r\nA reflection upon such a fact as this will at once lead us to turn our\r\nthoughts to those who, making loud complaints against luxury, have\r\nlamented that a single cook cost more money to buy than a horse; while\r\nat the present day a cook is only to be obtained for the same sum that\r\na triumph would cost, and a fish is only to be purchased at what was\r\nformerly the price for a cook! indeed, there is hardly any living being\r\nheld in higher esteem than the man who understands how, in the most\r\nscientific fashion, to get rid of his master’s property.\r\n\r\n(18.) Licinius Mucianus relates, that in the Red Sea there was caught\r\na mullet eighty[2425] pounds in weight. What a price would have been\r\npaid for it by our epicures, if it had only been found off the shores\r\nin the vicinity of our city!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—THAT THE SAME KINDS ARE NOT EVERYWHERE EQUALLY ESTEEMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is this also in the nature of fish, that some are more highly\r\nesteemed in one place, and some in another; such, for instance, as the\r\ncoracinus[2426] in Egypt, the zeus,[2427] also called the faber,[2428]\r\nat Gades, the salpa,[2429] in the vicinity of Ebusus,[2430] which\r\nis considered elsewhere an unclean fish, and can nowhere[2431] be\r\nthoroughly cooked, wherever found, without being first beaten with a\r\nstick: in Aquitania, again, the river salmon[2432] is preferred to all\r\nthe fish that swim in the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—GILLS AND SCALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome fishes have numerous gills, others again single[2433] ones,\r\nothers double; it is by means of these that they discharge the water\r\nthat has entered the mouth. A sign of old age[2434] is the hardness of\r\nthe scales, which are not alike in all. There are two lakes[2435] of\r\nItaly at the foot of the Alps, called Larius and Verbanus, in which\r\nthere are to be seen every year, at the rising of the Vergiliæ,[2436]\r\nfish remarkable for the number of their scales, and the exceeding\r\nsharpness[2437] of them, strongly resembling hob-nails[2438] in\r\nappearance; these fish, however, are only to be seen during that\r\nmonth,[2439] and no longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (19.)—FISHES WHICH HAVE A VOICE.—FISHES WITHOUT GILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nArcadia produces a wonder in its fish called exocœtus,[2440] from the\r\nfact that it comes ashore to sleep. In the neighbourhood of the river\r\nClitorius,[2441] this fish is said to be gifted with powers of speech,\r\nand to have no gills;[2442] by some writers it is called the adonis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—FISHES WHICH COME ON LAND. THE PROPER TIME FOR CATCHING FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose fish, also, which are known by the name of sea-mice,[2443] as\r\nwell as the polypi[2444] and the murænæ,[2445] are in the habit of\r\ncoming ashore—besides which, there is in the rivers of India[2446]\r\none kind that does this, and then leaps back again into the water—for\r\nthey are found to pass over into standing waters and streams. Most\r\nfishes have an evident instinct, which teaches them where to spawn in\r\nsafety; as in such places there are no enemies found to devour their\r\nyoung, while at the same time the waves are much less violent. It will\r\nbe still more a matter of surprise, to find that they thus have an\r\nappreciation of cause and effect, and understand the regular recurrence\r\nof periods, when we reflect how few persons there are that know that\r\nthe most favourable time for taking fish is while the sun is passing\r\nthrough the sign of Pisces.[2447]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (20.)—CLASSIFICATION OF FISHES, ACCORDING TO THE SHAPE OF THE\r\nBODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome sea-fish are flat, such, for instance, as the rhombus,[2448] the\r\nsole,[2449] and the sea-sparrow;[2450] which last only differs from\r\nthe rhombus in the lateral position of the body. The rhombus lies with\r\nthe right side upwards,[2451] while in the sea-sparrow the left side is\r\nuppermost. Some sea-fish, again, are long, as the muræna and the conger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—THE FINS OF FISH, AND THEIR MODE OF SWIMMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it is that there is a difference,[2452] also, in the fins of\r\nfish, which have been given them to serve in place of feet, none having\r\nmore than four,[2453] some two[2454] only, and others none.[2455]\r\nIt is in Lake Fucinus[2456] only that there is a fish found that\r\nhas eight fins[2457] for swimming. Those fishes which are long and\r\nslimy, have only two at most, such, for instance, as eels and congers:\r\nothers, again, have none, such as the muræna, which is also without\r\ngills.[2458] All these fish[2459] make their way in the sea by an\r\nundulatory motion of the body, just as serpents do on land; on dry\r\nland, also, they are able to crawl along, and hence those of this\r\nnature are more long-lived than the others. Some of the flat-fish,\r\nalso, have no fins, the pastinacæ,[2460] for instance—for these swim\r\nbroad-wise—those, also, which are known as the “soft” fish, such as the\r\npolypi, for their feet[2461] serve them in stead of fins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38. (21.)—EELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEels live eight[2462] years; they are able to survive out of water as\r\nmuch as six days,[2463] when a north-east wind blows; but when the\r\nsouth wind prevails, not so many. In winter,[2464] they cannot live\r\nif they are in very shallow water, nor yet if the water is troubled.\r\nHence it is that they are taken more especially about the rising of the\r\nVergiliæ,[2465] when the rivers are mostly in a turbid state. These\r\nanimals seek their food at night; they are the only fish the bodies of\r\nwhich, when dead, do not float[2466] upon the surface.\r\n\r\n(22.) There is a lake called Benacus,[2467] in the territory of Verona,\r\nin Italy, through which the river Mincius flows.[2468] At the part of\r\nit whence this river issues, once a year, and mostly in the month of\r\nOctober, the lake is troubled, evidently by the constellations[2469]\r\nof autumn, and the eels are heaped together[2470] by the waves, and\r\nrolled on by them in such astonishing multitudes, that single masses\r\nof them, containing more than a thousand in number, are often taken in\r\nthe chambers[2471] which are formed in the bed of the river for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (23.)—THE MURÆNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe muræna brings forth every month, while all the other fishes\r\nspawn only at stated periods: the eggs of this fish increase with\r\nthe greatest rapidity.[2472] It is a vulgar[2473] belief that the\r\nmuræna comes on shore, and is there impregnated by intercourse with\r\nserpents. Aristotle[2474] calls the male, which impregnates the female,\r\nby the name of “zmyrus;” and says that there is a difference between\r\nthem, the muræna being spotted[2475] and weakly, while the zmyrus is\r\nall of one colour and hardy, and has teeth which project beyond the\r\nmouth. In northern Gaul all the murænæ have on the right jaw seven\r\nspots,[2476] which bear a resemblance to the constellation of the\r\nSeptentriones,[2477] and are of a gold colour, shining as long as\r\nthe animal is alive, but disappearing as soon as it is dead. Vedius\r\nPollio,[2478] a Roman of equestrian rank, and one of the friends of\r\nthe late Emperor Augustus, found a method of exercising his cruelty by\r\nmeans of this animal, for he caused such slaves as had been condemned\r\nby him, to be thrown into preserves filled with murænæ; not that the\r\nland animals would not have fully sufficed for this purpose, but\r\nbecause he could not see a man so aptly torn to pieces all at once by\r\nany other kind of animal. It is said that these fish are driven to\r\nmadness by the taste of vinegar. Their skin is exceedingly thin; while\r\nthat of the eel, on the other hand, is much thicker. Verrius informs\r\nus that formerly the children of the Roman citizens, while wearing the\r\nprætexta,[2479] were flogged with eel-skins, and that, for this reason,\r\nno pecuniary penalty[2480] could by law be inflicted upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40. (24.)—VARIOUS KINDS OF FLAT FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of flat fish, which, instead of bones, has\r\ncartilage, such, for instance, as the raia,[2481] the pastinaca,[2482]\r\nthe squatina,[2483] the torpedo,[2484] and those which, under their\r\nrespective Greek names, are known as the ox,[2485] the lamia,[2486]\r\nthe eagle,[2487] and the frog.[2488] In this number, also, the\r\nsquali[2489] ought to be included, although they are not flat fish.\r\nAristotle was the first to call these fish by the one generic name\r\nof σελάχη,[2490] which he has given them: we, however, have no mode\r\nof distinguishing them, unless, indeed, we choose to call them the\r\n“cartilaginous” fishes. All these fish are carnivorous,[2491] and feed\r\nlying on their backs, just as dolphins do, as already[2492] noticed;\r\nwhile the other fishes,[2493] too, are oviparous, this one kind, with\r\nthe exception of that known as the sea-frog, is viviparous, like the\r\ncetacea.[2494]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (25.)—THE ECHENEIS, AND ITS USES IN ENCHANTMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a very small fish[2495] that is in the habit of living among\r\nthe rocks, and is known as the echeneis.[2496] It is believed that\r\nwhen this has attached itself to the keel of a ship its progress\r\nis impeded, and that it is from this circumstance that it takes its\r\nname.[2497] For this reason, also, it has a disgraceful repute, as\r\nbeing employed in love philtres,[2498] and for the purpose of retarding\r\njudgments and legal proceedings—evil properties, which are only\r\ncompensated by a single merit that it possesses—it is good for staying\r\nfluxes of the womb in pregnant women, and preserves the fœtus up to\r\nbirth: it is never used, however, for food.[2499] Aristotle[2500] is\r\nof opinion that this fish has feet, so strong is the resemblance, by\r\nreason of the form and position of the fins.\r\n\r\nMucianus speaks of a murex[2501] of larger size than the purple, with a\r\nhead that is neither rough nor round; and the shell of which is single,\r\nand falls in folds on either side.[2502] He tells us, also, that some\r\nof these creatures once attached themselves to a ship freighted with\r\nchildren[2503] of noble birth, who were being sent by Periander for the\r\npurpose of being castrated, and that they stopped its course in full\r\nsail; and he further says, that the shell-fish which did this service\r\nare duly honoured in the temple of Venus,[2504] at Cnidos. Trebius\r\nNiger says that this fish is a foot in length, and that it can retard\r\nthe course of vessels, five fingers in thickness; besides which, it has\r\nanother peculiar property—when preserved in salt, and applied, it is\r\nable to draw up gold which has fallen into a well, however deep it may\r\nhappen to be.[2505]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42. (26.)—FISHES WHICH CHANGE THEIR COLOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mæna changes[2506] its white colour, and in summer becomes swarthy.\r\nThe phycis[2507] also changes its colour, and while at other times it\r\nis white, in spring it is parti-coloured. This last is the only fish\r\nthat builds itself a nest; it makes it of sea-weed, and there deposits\r\nits eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—FISHES WHICH FLY ABOVE THE WATER.—THE SEA-SWALLOW.—THE FISH\r\nTHAT SHINES IN THE NIGHT.—THE HORNED FISH.—THE SEA-DRAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea-swallow,[2508] being able to fly, bears a strong resemblance to\r\nthe bird of that name; the sea-kite[2509] too, flies as well.\r\n\r\n(27.) There is a fish that comes up to the surface of the sea, known,\r\nfrom the following circumstance, as the lantern-fish:[2510] thrusting\r\nfrom its mouth a tongue that shines like fire, it emits a most\r\nbrilliant light on calm nights. Another fish, which, from its horns,\r\nhas received its name,[2511] raises them nearly a foot and a half\r\nabove the surface of the water. The sea-dragon,[2512] again, if caught\r\nand thrown on the sand, works out a hole for itself with its muzzle,\r\nwith the most wonderful celerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44. (28.)—FISHES WHICH HAVE NO BLOOD.—FISHES KNOWN AS SOFT FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe varieties of fish which we shall now mention are those which have\r\nno blood: they are of three kinds[2513]—first, those which are known as\r\n“soft;” next, those which have thin crusts; and, lastly, those which\r\nare enclosed in hard shells. The soft fish are the loligo,[2514] the\r\nsæpia,[2515] the polypus,[2516] and others of a similar nature. These\r\nlast have the head between the feet and the belly, and have, all of\r\nthem, eight feet: in the sæpia and the loligo two of these feet are\r\nvery long[2517] and rough, and by means of these they lift the food to\r\ntheir mouth, and attach themselves to places in the sea, as though with\r\nan anchor; the others act as so many arms, by means of which they seize\r\ntheir prey.[2518]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45. (29.)—THE SÆPIA, THE LOLIGO, THE SCALLOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loligo is also able to dart above the surface of the water, and\r\nthe scallop does the same, just like an arrow as it were. In the\r\nsæpia,[2519] the male is parti-coloured, blacker than the female, and\r\nmore courageous. If the female is struck with a fish-spear, the male\r\ncomes to her aid; but the female, the instant the male is struck, takes\r\nto flight. Both of them, as soon as ever they find themselves in danger\r\nof being caught. discharge[2520] a kind of ink, which with them is in\r\nplace of blood,[2521] and thus darkening the water, take to flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—THE POLYPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous kinds of polypi. The land[2522] polypus is larger\r\nthan that of the sea; they all of them use their arms[2523] as feet\r\nand hands; and in coupling they employ the tail, which is forked[2524]\r\nand sharp. The polypus has a sort of passage in the back,[2525] by\r\nwhich it lets in and discharges the water, and which it shifts from\r\nside to side, sometimes carrying it on the right, and sometimes on the\r\nleft. It swims obliquely,[2526] with the head on one side, which is of\r\nsurprising hardness while the animal is alive, being puffed out with\r\nair.[2527] In addition to this, they have cavities[2528] dispersed\r\nthroughout the claws, by means of which, through suction, they can\r\nadhere to objects; which they hold, with the head upwards, so tightly,\r\nthat they cannot be torn away. They cannot attach themselves, however,\r\nto the bottom of the sea, and their retentive powers are weaker in the\r\nlarger ones. These are the only[2529] soft fish that come on dry land,\r\nand then only where the surface is rugged: a smooth surface they will\r\nnot come near. They feed upon the flesh of shell-fish, the shells of\r\nwhich they can easily break in the embrace of their arms: hence it is\r\nthat their retreat may be easily detected by the pieces of shell which\r\nlie before it. Although, in other respects, this is looked upon as a\r\nremarkably stupid kind of animal, so much so, that it will swim towards\r\nthe hand of a man, to a certain extent in its own domestic matters it\r\nmanifests considerable intelligence. It carries its prey to its home,\r\nand after eating all the flesh, throws out the debris, and then pursues\r\nsuch small fish as may chance to swim towards them. It also changes\r\nits colour[2530] according to the aspect of the place where it is, and\r\nmore especially when it is alarmed. The notion is entirely unfounded\r\nthat it gnaws[2531] its own arms; for it is from the congers that this\r\nmischance befalls it; but it is no other than true that its arms shoot\r\nforth again, like the tail in the colotus[2532] and the lizard.[2533]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—THE NAUTILUS, OR SAILING POLYPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable curiosities is the animal which has the\r\nname[2534] of nautilus, or, as some people call it, the pompilos. Lying\r\nwith the head upwards, it rises to the surface of the water, raising\r\nitself little by little, while, by means of a certain conduit in its\r\nbody, it discharges all the water, and this being got rid of like so\r\nmuch bilge-water as it were, it finds no difficulty in sailing along.\r\nThen, extending backwards its two front arms, it stretches out between\r\nthem a membrane[2535] of marvellous thinness, which acts as a sail\r\nspread out to the wind, while with the rest of its arms it paddles\r\nalong below, steering itself with its tail in the middle, which acts\r\nas a rudder. Thus does it make its way along the deep, mimicking the\r\nappearance of a light Liburnian[2536] bark; while, if anything chances\r\nto cause it alarm, in an instant it draws in the water, and sinks to\r\nthe bottom.[2537]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48. (30.)—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF POLYPI; THEIR SHREWDNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelonging to the genus of polypi is the animal known as the\r\nozæna,[2538] being so called from the peculiarly strong smell exhaled\r\nby the head;[2539] in consequence of which, the murænæ[2540] pursue it\r\nwith the greatest eagerness. The polypi keep themselves concealed for\r\ntwo months in the year; they do not live beyond two[2541] years, and\r\nalways die of consumption, the females even sooner,[2542] and mostly\r\nafter bringing forth. I must not omit here the observations which L.\r\nLucullus, the proconsul of Bætica, made with reference to the polypus,\r\nand which Trebius Niger, one of his suite, has published. He says that\r\nit is remarkably fond of shell-fish, and that these, the moment that\r\nthey feel themselves touched by it, close their valves, and cut off\r\nthe feelers of the polypus, thus making a meal at the expense of the\r\nplunderer. Shell-fish are destitute of sight, and, indeed, all other\r\nsensations but those which warn them of hunger and the approach of\r\ndanger. Hence it is, that the polypus lies in ambush[2543] till the\r\nfish opens its shell, immediately upon which, it places within it a\r\nsmall pebble, taking care, at the same time, to keep it from touching\r\nthe body of the animal, lest, by making some movement, it should chance\r\nto eject it. Having made itself thus secure, it attacks its prey, and\r\ndraws out the flesh, while the other tries to contract itself, but all\r\nin vain, in consequence of the separation of the shell, thus effected\r\nby the insertion of the wedge. So great is the instinctive shrewdness\r\nin animals that are otherwise quite remarkable for their lumpish\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the same author states, that there is not\r\nan animal in existence, that is more dangerous for its powers of\r\ndestroying a human being[2544] when in the water. Embracing his body,\r\nit counteracts his struggles, and draws him under with its feelers and\r\nits numerous suckers, when, as often is the case, it happens to make an\r\nattack upon a shipwrecked mariner or a child. If, however, the animal\r\nis turned over, it loses all its power; for when it is thrown upon the\r\nback, the arms open of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe other particulars, which the same author has given, appear still\r\nmore closely to border upon the marvellous. At Carteia,[2545] in the\r\npreserves there, a polypus was in the habit of coming from the sea\r\nto the[2546] pickling-tubs that were left open, and devouring the\r\nfish laid in salt there—for it is quite astonishing how eagerly all\r\nsea-animals follow even the very smell of salted condiments, so much\r\nso, that it is for this reason, that the fishermen take care to rub\r\nthe inside of the wicker fish-kipes[2547] with them.—At last, by\r\nits repeated thefts and immoderate depredations, it drew down upon\r\nitself the wrath of the keepers of the works. Palisades were placed\r\nbefore them, but these the polypus managed to get over by the aid of a\r\ntree,[2548] and it was only caught at last by calling in the assistance\r\nof trained dogs, which surrounded it at night, as it was returning to\r\nits prey; upon which, the keepers, awakened by the noise, were struck\r\nwith alarm at the novelty of the sight presented. First of all, the\r\nsize of the polypus was enormous beyond all conception; and then it\r\nwas covered all over with dried brine, and exhaled a most dreadful\r\nstench. Who could have expected to find a polypus there, or could have\r\nrecognized it as such under these circumstances? They really thought\r\nthat they were joining battle with some monster, for at one instant,\r\nit would drive off the dogs by its horrible fumes,[2549] and lash at\r\nthem with the extremities of its feelers; while at another, it would\r\nstrike them with its stronger arms, giving blows with so many clubs,\r\nas it were; and it was only with the greatest difficulty that it could\r\nbe dispatched with the aid of a considerable number of three-pronged\r\nfish-spears. The head of this animal was shewn to Lucullus; it was in\r\nsize as large as a cask of fifteen amphoræ, and had a beard,[2550]\r\nto use the expressions of Trebius himself, which could hardly be\r\nencircled with both arms, full of knots, like those upon a club, and\r\nthirty feet in length; the suckers or calicules,[2551] as large as\r\nan urn, resembled a basin in shape, while the teeth again were of a\r\ncorresponding largeness: its remains, which were carefully preserved as\r\na curiosity, weighed seven hundred pounds. The same author also informs\r\nus, that specimens of the sæpia and the loligo have been thrown up on\r\nthe same shores of a size fully as large: in our own seas[2552] the\r\nloligo is sometimes found five cubits in length, and the sæpia, two.\r\nThese animals do not live beyond two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—THE SAILING NAUPLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMucianus also relates that he had seen, in the Propontis, another\r\ncurious resemblance to a ship in full sail.[2553] There is a\r\nshell-fish, he says, with a keel, just like that of the vessel which\r\nwe know by the name of acatium,[2554] with the poop curving inwards,\r\nand a prow with the beak[2555] attached. In this shell-fish there\r\nlies concealed also an animal known as the nauplius, which bears a\r\nstrong resemblance to the sæpia, and only adopts the shell-fish as\r\nthe companion of its pastimes. There are two modes, he says, which it\r\nadopts in sailing; when the sea is calm, the voyager hangs down its\r\narms,[2556] and strikes the water with a pair of oars as it were; but\r\nif, on the other hand, the wind invites, it extends them, employing\r\nthem by way of a helm, and turning the mouth of the shell to the wind.\r\nThe pleasure experienced by the shell-fish is that of carrying the\r\nother, while the amusement of the nauplius consists in steering; and\r\nthus, at the same moment, is an instinctive joy felt by these two\r\ncreatures, devoid as they are of all sense, unless, indeed, a natural\r\nantipathy to man—for it is a well-known fact, that to see them thus\r\nsailing along, is a bad omen, and that it is portentous of misfortune\r\nto those who witness it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—SEA-ANIMALS, WHICH ARE ENCLOSED WITH A CRUST; THE CRAY-FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cray-fish,[2557] which belongs to that class of animals which is\r\ndestitute of blood, is protected by a brittle crust. This creature\r\nkeeps itself concealed for five months, and the same is the case with\r\ncrabs, which disappear for the same period. At the beginning of spring,\r\nhowever, they both[2558] of them, after the manner of snakes, throw\r\noff old age, and renew their coverings. While other animals swim on the\r\nwater, cray-fish float with a kind of action like creeping. They move\r\nonwards, if there is nothing to alarm[2559] them, in a straight line,\r\nextending on each side their horns, which are rounded at the point\r\nby a ball peculiar to them; but, on the other hand, the moment they\r\nare alarmed, they straighten these horns, and proceed with a sidelong\r\nmotion. They also use[2560] these horns when fighting with each other.\r\nThe cray-fish is the only animal that has the flesh in a pulpy state,\r\nand not firm and solid, unless it is cooked alive in boiling water.\r\n\r\n(31.) The cray-fish frequents rocky places, the crab[2561] spots which\r\npresent a soft surface. In winter they both choose such parts of\r\nthe shore as are exposed to the heat of the sun, and in summer they\r\nwithdraw to the shady recesses of deep inlets of the sea. All fish\r\nof this kind suffer from the cold of winter, but become fat during\r\nautumn and spring, and more particularly during the full moon; for the\r\nwarmth of that luminary, as it shines in the night, renders[2562] the\r\ntemperature of the weather more moderate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF CRABS; THE PINNOTHERES, THE SEA URCHIN,\r\nCOCKLES, AND SCALLOPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are various kinds of crabs,[2563] known as carabi,[2564]\r\nastaci,[2565] maiæ,[2566] paguri,[2567] heracleotici,[2568]\r\nlions,[2569] and others of less note. The carabus differs[2570]\r\nfrom other crabs, in having a tail: in Phœnicia they are called\r\nhippoi,[2571] or horses, being of such extraordinary swiftness, that it\r\nis impossible to overtake them. Crabs are long-lived, and have eight\r\nfeet, all of which are bent obliquely. In the female[2572] the first\r\nfoot is double, in the male single; besides which, the animal has two\r\nclaws with indented pincers. The upper part only of these fore-feet is\r\nmoveable, the lower being immoveable: the right claw is the largest in\r\nthem all.[2573] Sometimes they assemble together in large bodies;[2574]\r\nbut as they are unable to cross the mouth of the Euxine, they turn back\r\nagain and go round by land, and the road by which they travel is to be\r\nseen all beaten down with their foot-marks.\r\n\r\nThe smallest crab of any is that known as the pinnotheres,[2575] and\r\nhence it is peculiarly exposed to danger; its shrewdness, however, is\r\nevinced by its concealing itself in the shell of the oyster; and as it\r\ngrows larger, it removes to those of a larger size.\r\n\r\nCrabs, when alarmed, go backwards as swiftly as when moving forwards.\r\nThey fight with one another like rams, butting at each other with their\r\nhorns. They have[2576] a mode of curing themselves of the bites of\r\nserpents. It is said,[2577] that while the sun is passing through the\r\nsign of Cancer, the dead bodies of the crabs, which are lying thrown up\r\non the shore, are transformed into serpents.\r\n\r\nTo the same class[2578] also belongs the sea-urchin,[2579] which has\r\nspines in place of feet;[2580] its mode of moving along is to roll\r\nlike a ball, hence it is that these animals are often found with their\r\nprickles rubbed off. Those among them which have the longest spines of\r\nall, are known by the name of echinometræ,[2581] while at the same time\r\ntheir body is the very smallest. They are not all of them of the same\r\nglassy colour; in the vicinity of Torone[2582] they are white,[2583]\r\nwith very short spines. The eggs[2584] of all of them are bitter, and\r\nare five in number; the mouth is situate in the middle of the body,\r\nand faces the earth.[2585] It is said[2586] that these creatures\r\nforeknow the approach of a storm at sea, and that they take up little\r\nstones with which they cover[2587] themselves, and so provide a sort\r\nof ballast against their volubility, for they are very unwilling by\r\nrolling along to wear away their prickles. As soon as seafaring persons\r\nobserve this, they at once moor their ship with several anchors.\r\n\r\n(32.) To the same genus[2588] also belong both land and water[2589]\r\nsnails, which thrust the body forth from their abode, and extend or\r\ncontract two horns, as it were. They are without eyes,[2590] and have,\r\ntherefore, to feel their way, by means of these horns.\r\n\r\n(33.) Sea-scallops[2591] are considered to belong to the same class,\r\nwhich also conceal themselves during severe frosts and great heats; the\r\nonyches,[2592] too, which shine in the dark like fire, and in the mouth\r\neven while being eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—VARIOUS KINDS OF SHELL-FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to the murex[2593] and various kinds of shell-fish,\r\nwhich have a stronger shell, and in which Nature, in her sportive\r\nmood, has displayed a great variety—so many are the various hues of\r\ntheir tints, so numerous are their shapes, flat,[2594] concave,[2595]\r\nlong,[2596] crescent-shaped,[2597] rounded into a globe, cut[2598]\r\nthrough into a semi-globe, arched in the back, smooth, rough, indented,\r\nstreaked, the upper part spirally wreathed, the edge projecting in\r\na sharp point, the edge wreathed outwards,[2599] or else folding\r\ninwards.[2600] And then, too, there are the various distinctions[2601]\r\nof rayed shells, long-haired[2602] shells, wavy-haired shells,\r\nchannelled shells, pectinated shells, imbricated shells, reticulated\r\nshells, shells with lines oblique or rectilinear, thick-set shells,\r\nexpanded shells, tortuous shells, shells the valves of which are united\r\nby one small knot, shells which are held together all along one side,\r\nshells which are open as if in the very act of applauding,[2603] and\r\nshells which wind,[2604] resembling a conch. The fish of this class,\r\nknown as the shells of Venus,[2605] are able to navigate the surface\r\nof the deep, and, presenting to the wind their concave side, catch the\r\nbreeze, and sail along on the surface of the sea. Scallops are also\r\nable to leap[2606] and fly above the surface of the water, and they\r\nsometimes employ their shell by way of a bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53. (34.)—WHAT NUMEROUS APPLIANCES OF LUXURY ARE FOUND IN THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut why mention such trifles as these, when I am sensible that no\r\ngreater inroads have been made upon our morals, and no more rapid\r\nadvances have been made by luxury, than those effected through the\r\nmedium of shell-fish? Of all the elements that exist, the sea is the\r\none that costs the dearest to the belly; seeing that it provides so\r\nmany kinds of meats, so many dishes, so many exquisite flavours\r\nderived from fish, all of which are valued in proportion to the danger\r\nundergone by those who have caught them.\r\n\r\n(35.) But still, how insignificant is all this when we come to think\r\nof our purple, our azure,[2607] and our pearls; it was not enough,\r\nforsooth, for the spoils of the sea to be thrust down the gullet—but\r\nthey must be employed as well to adorn the hands, the ears, the head,\r\nthe whole body, in fact, and that of the men pretty nearly as much\r\nas the women. What has the sea to do with our clothes?[2608] What is\r\nthere in common between waves and billows and a sheep’s fleece? This\r\none element ought not to receive us, according to ordinary notions,\r\nexcept in a state of nakedness. Let there be ever so strong an alliance\r\nbetween it and the belly, on the score of gluttony, still, what can it\r\npossibly have to do with the back? It is not enough, forsooth, that we\r\nare fed upon what is acquired by perils, but we must be clothed, too,\r\nin a similar way; so true it is, that for all the wants of the body,\r\nthat which is sought at the expense of human life, is sure to please us\r\nthe most.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—PEARLS; HOW THEY ARE PRODUCED, AND WHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first rank then, and the very highest position among all valuables,\r\nbelongs to the pearl. It is the Indian Ocean that principally sends\r\nthem to us: and thus have they, amid those monsters so frightful and\r\nso huge which we have already described,[2609] to cross so many seas,\r\nand to traverse such lengthened tracts of land, scorched by the ardent\r\nrays of a burning sun: and then, too, by the Indians themselves they\r\nhave to be sought in certain islands, and those but very few in number.\r\nThe most productive of pearls is the island of Taprobane, and that of\r\nStoïdis, as already mentioned[2610] in the description of the world;\r\nPerimula,[2611] also, a promontory of India. But those are most highly\r\nvalued which are found in the vicinity of Arabia,[2612] in the Persian\r\nGulf, which forms a part of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nThe origin[2613] and production of the shell-fish is not very different\r\nfrom that of the shell of the oyster. When the genial season of the\r\nyear[2614] exercises its influence on the animal, it is said that,\r\nyawning, as it were, it opens its shell, and so receives a kind of\r\ndew, by means of which it becomes impregnated; and that at length it\r\ngives birth, after many struggles, to the burden of its shell, in the\r\nshape of pearls, which vary according to the quality of the dew. If\r\nthis has been in a perfectly pure state when it flowed into the shell,\r\nthen the pearl produced is white and brilliant, but if it was turbid,\r\nthen the pearl is of a clouded colour also; if the sky should happen\r\nto have been lowering when it was generated, the pearl will be of a\r\npallid colour; from all which it is quite evident that the quality of\r\nthe pearl depends much more upon a calm state of the heavens than of\r\nthe sea, and hence it is that it contracts a cloudy hue, or a limpid\r\nappearance, according to the degree of serenity of the sky in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIf, again, the fish is satiated in a reasonable time, then the pearl\r\nproduced increases rapidly in size. If it should happen to lighten at\r\nthe time, the animal shuts its shell, and the pearl is diminished in\r\nsize in proportion to the fast that the animal has to endure: but if,\r\nin addition to this, it should thunder[2615] as well, then it becomes\r\nalarmed, and closing the shell in an instant, produces what is known\r\nas a physema,[2616] or pearl-bubble, filled with air, and bearing a\r\nresemblance to a pearl, but in appearance only, as it is quite empty,\r\nand devoid of body; these bubbles are formed by the abortion of the\r\nshell-fish. Those which are produced in a perfectly healthy state\r\nconsist of numerous layers, so that they may be looked upon, not\r\ninappropriately, as similar in conformation to the callosities on the\r\nbody of an animal; and they should therefore be cleaned by experienced\r\nhands. It is wonderful, however, that they should be influenced thus\r\npleasurably by the state of the heavens, seeing that by the action\r\nof the sun the pearls are turned of a red colour, and lose all their\r\nwhiteness, just like the human body. Hence it is that those which\r\nkeep their whiteness the best are the pelagiæ, or main-sea pearls,\r\nwhich lie at too great a depth to be reached by the sun’s rays; and\r\nyet these even turn yellow with age, grow dull and wrinkled, and it\r\nis only in their youth that they possess that brilliancy which is so\r\nhighly esteemed in them. When old, too, the coat grows thick, and they\r\nadhere to the shell,[2617] from which they can only be separated with\r\nthe assistance of a file.[2618] Those pearls which have one surface\r\nflat and the other spherical, opposite to the plane side, are for that\r\nreason called tympania,[2619] or tambour-pearls. I have seen pearls\r\nstill adhering to the shell; for which reason the shells were used as\r\nboxes for unguents. In addition to these facts, we may remark that the\r\npearl is soft[2620] in the water, but that it grows hard the instant it\r\nis taken out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—HOW PEARLS ARE FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fish, as soon as ever it perceives the hand,[2621] shuts its shell\r\nand covers up its treasures, being well aware that it is for them that\r\nit is sought; and if it happens to catch the hand,[2622] it cuts it\r\noff with the sharp edge of the shell. And no punishment is there that\r\ncould be more justly inflicted. There are other penalties added as\r\nwell, seeing that the greater part of these pearls are only to be found\r\namong rocks and crags, while on the other hand, those which lie out\r\nin the main sea are generally accompanied by sea-dogs.[2623] And yet,\r\nfor all this, the women will not banish these gems from their ears!\r\nSome writers say,[2624] that these animals live in communities, just\r\nlike swarms of bees, each of them being governed by one remarkable for\r\nits size and its venerable old age;[2625] while at the same time it is\r\npossessed of marvellous skill in taking all due precautions against\r\ndanger; the divers, they say, take especial care to find these, and\r\nwhen once they are taken, the others stray to and fro, and are easily\r\ncaught in their nets. We learn also that as soon as they are taken they\r\nare placed under a thick layer of salt in earthen-ware vessels; as\r\nthe flesh is gradually consumed, certain knots,[2626] which form the\r\npearls, are disengaged[2627] from their bodies, and fall to the bottom\r\nof the vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PEARLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that pearls wear with use, and will change their\r\ncolour, if neglected. All their merit consists in their whiteness,\r\nlarge size, roundness, polish, and weight; qualities which are not\r\neasily to be found united in the same; so much so, indeed, that no\r\ntwo pearls are ever found perfectly alike; and it was from this\r\ncircumstance, no doubt, that our Roman luxury first gave them the name\r\nof “unio,”[2628] or the unique gem: for a similar name is not given\r\nthem by the Greeks; nor, indeed, among the barbarians by whom they\r\nare found are they called anything else but “margaritæ.”[2629] Even\r\nin the very whiteness of the pearl there is a great difference to be\r\nobserved. Those are of a much clearer water that are found in the Red\r\nSea,[2630] while the Indian pearl resembles in tint the scales[2631]\r\nof the mirror-stone, but exceeds all the others in size. The colour\r\nthat is most highly prized of all, is that of those which are thence\r\ncalled alum-coloured[2632] pearls. Long pearls also have their peculiar\r\nvalue; those are called “elenchi,” which are of a long tapering shape,\r\nresembling our alabaster[2633] boxes in form, and ending in a full\r\nbulb.[2634] Our ladies quite glory in having these suspended from their\r\nfingers, or two or three of them dangling from their ears. For the\r\npurpose of ministering to these luxurious tastes, there are various\r\nnames and wearisome refinements which have been devised by profuseness\r\nand prodigality; for after inventing these ear-rings, they have given\r\nthem the name of “crotalia,”[2635] or castanet pendants, as though\r\nquite delighted even with the rattling of the pearls as they knock\r\nagainst each other; and now, at the present day, the poorer classes\r\nare even affecting them, as people are in the habit of saying, that “a\r\npearl worn by a woman in public, is as good as a lictor[2636] walking\r\nbefore her.” Nay, even more than this, they put them on their feet,\r\nand that, not only on the laces of their sandals, but all over the\r\nshoes;[2637] it is not enough to wear pearls, but they must tread upon\r\nthem, and walk with them under foot as well.\r\n\r\nPearls used formerly to be found in our sea, but more frequently\r\nabout the Thracian Bosporus;[2638] they were of a red colour, and\r\nsmall,[2639] and enclosed in a shell-fish known by the name of “myes.”\r\nIn Acarnania there is a shell-fish called “pina,”[2640] which produces\r\npearls; and from this it is quite evident that it is not one kind of\r\nfish only that produces them. Juba states also, that on the shores\r\nof Arabia there is a shell-fish which resembles a notched comb, and\r\ncovered all over with hair[2641] like a sea-urchin, and that the pearl\r\nlies imbedded in its flesh, in appearance bearing a strong resemblance\r\nto a hailstone.[2642] No such shell-fish, however, as these are ever\r\nbrought to Rome. Nor yet are any pearls of value found in Acarnania,\r\nbeing shapeless, rough, and of a marble hue; those are better which are\r\nfound in the vicinity of Actium; but still they are small, which is\r\nthe case also with those found on the coast of Mauritania. Alexander\r\nPolyhistor and Sudines[2643] are of opinion that as they grow old their\r\ntints gradually fade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57.—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH PEARLS—THEIR NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that the interior of the pearl is solid, as no fall\r\nis able to break it. Pearls are not always found in the middle of the\r\nbody of the animal, but sometimes in one place, and sometimes another.\r\nIndeed, I have seen some which lay at the edge of the shell, just as\r\nthough in the very act of coming forth, and in some fishes as many as\r\nfour or five. Up to the present time, very few have been found which\r\nexceeded half an ounce in weight, by more than one scruple. It is a\r\nwell-ascertained fact, that in Britannia[2644] pearls are found, though\r\nsmall, and of a bad colour; for the deified Julius Cæsar[2645] wished\r\nit to be distinctly understood,[2646] that the breast-plate which he\r\ndedicated to Venus Genetrix, in her temple, was made of British pearls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—INSTANCES OF THE USE OF PEARLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI once saw Lollia Paulina,[2647] the wife of the Emperor Caius[2648]—it\r\nwas not at any public festival, or any solemn ceremonial, but only at\r\nan ordinary wedding entertainment[2649]—covered with emeralds and\r\npearls, which shone in alternate layers upon her head, in her hair, in\r\nher wreaths, in her ears, upon her neck, in her bracelets, and on her\r\nfingers, and the value of which amounted in all to forty millions[2650]\r\nof sesterces; indeed[2651] she was prepared at once to prove the fact,\r\nby showing the receipts and acquittances. Nor were these any presents\r\nmade by a prodigal potentate, but treasures which had descended to\r\nher from her grandfather, and obtained by the spoliation of the\r\nprovinces. Such are the fruits of plunder and extortion! It was for\r\nthis reason that M. Lollius[2652] was held so infamous all over the\r\nEast for the presents which he extorted from the kings; the result of\r\nwhich was, that he was denied the friendship of Caius Cæsar, and took\r\npoison;[2653] and all this was done, I say, that his grand-daughter\r\nmight be seen, by the glare of lamps, covered all over with jewels\r\nto the amount of forty millions of sesterces! Now let a person only\r\npicture to himself, on the one hand, what was the value of the habits\r\nworn by Curius or Fabricius in their triumphs, let him picture to\r\nhimself the objects displayed to the public on their triumphal\r\nlitters,[2654] and then, on the other hand, let him think upon this\r\nLollia, this one bit[2655] of a woman, the head of an empire, taking\r\nher place at table, thus attired; would he not much rather that the\r\nconquerors had been torn from their very chariots, than that they had\r\nconquered for such a result as this?\r\n\r\nNor, indeed, are these the most supreme evidences of luxury. There were\r\nformerly two pearls, the largest that had been ever seen in the whole\r\nworld: Cleopatra, the last of the queens of Egypt, was in possession\r\nof them both, they having come to her by descent from the kings of the\r\nEast. When Antony had been sated by her, day after day, with the most\r\nexquisite banquets, this queenly courtesan, inflated with vanity and\r\ndisdainful arrogance, affected to treat all this sumptuousness and\r\nall these vast preparations with the greatest contempt; upon which\r\nAntony enquired what there was that could possibly be added to such\r\nextraordinary magnificence. To this she made answer, that on a single\r\nentertainment she would expend ten millions[2656] of sesterces. Antony\r\nwas extremely desirous to learn how that could be done, but looked\r\nupon it as a thing quite impossible; and a wager was the result. On\r\nthe following day, upon which the matter was to be decided, in order\r\nthat she might not lose the wager, she had an entertainment set before\r\nAntony, magnificent in every respect, though no better than his usual\r\nrepast. Upon this, Antony joked her, and enquired what was the amount\r\nexpended upon it; to which she made answer that the banquet which he\r\nthen beheld was only a trifling appendage[2657] to the real banquet,\r\nand that she alone[2658] would consume at the meal to the ascertained\r\nvalue of that amount, she herself would swallow the ten millions of\r\nsesterces; and so ordered the second course to be served. In obedience\r\nto her instructions, the servants placed before her a single vessel,\r\nwhich was filled with vinegar, a liquid, the sharpness and strength of\r\nwhich is able[2659] to dissolve pearls. At this moment she was wearing\r\nin her ears those choicest and most rare and unique productions of\r\nNature; and while Antony was waiting to see what she was going to do,\r\ntaking one of them from out of her ear, she threw it into the vinegar,\r\nand directly it was melted, swallowed it. Lucius Plancus,[2660] who\r\nhad been named umpire in the wager, placed his hand upon the other at\r\nthe very instant that she was making preparations to dissolve it in a\r\nsimilar manner, and declared that Antony had lost—an omen which,[2661]\r\nin the result, was fully confirmed. The fame of the second pearl is\r\nequal to that which attends its fellow. After the queen, who had thus\r\ncome off victorious on so important a question, had been seized, it was\r\ncut asunder, in order that this, the other half of the entertainment,\r\nmight serve as pendants for the ears of Venus, in the Pantheon at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59.—HOW PEARLS FIRST CAME INTO USE AT ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntony and Cleopatra, however, will not bear away the palm of\r\nprodigality in this respect, and will be stripped of even this boast in\r\nthe annals of luxury. For before their time, Clodius, the son of the\r\ntragic actor Æsopus,[2662] had done the same at Rome; having been left\r\nby his father heir to his ample wealth and possessions. Let not Antony\r\nthen be too proud, for all his triumvirate, since he can hardly stand\r\nin comparison with an actor; one, too, who had no wager to induce him—a\r\nthing which adds to the regal munificence of the act—but was merely\r\ndesirous of trying, by way of glorification to his palate, what was the\r\ntaste of pearls. As he found it to be wonderfully pleasing, that he\r\nmight not be the only one to know it, he had a pearl set before each\r\nof his guests for him to swallow. After the surrender of Alexandria,\r\npearls came into common and, indeed, universal use at Rome; but they\r\nfirst began to be used about the time of Sylla, though but of small\r\nsize and of little value, Fenestella says—in this, however, it is quite\r\nevident that he is mistaken, for Ælius Stilo tells us, that it was in\r\nthe time of the Jugurthine war, that the name of “unio” was first given\r\nto pearls of remarkable size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60.—THE NATURE OF THE MUREX AND THE PURPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet pearls may be looked upon as pretty nearly a possession of\r\neverlasting duration—they descend from a man to his heir, and they\r\nare alienated from one to another just like any landed estate. But\r\nthe colours that are extracted from the murex[2663] and the purple\r\nfade from hour to hour; and yet luxury, which has similarly acted as\r\na mother to them, has set upon them prices almost equal to those of\r\npearls.\r\n\r\n(36.) Purples live mostly seven[2664] years. Like the murex, they keep\r\nthemselves in concealment for thirty days, about the time of the rising\r\nof the Dog-star; in the spring season they unite in large bodies, and\r\nby rubbing against each other, produce a viscous spittle, from which a\r\nkind of wax is formed. The murex does the same; but the purple[2665]\r\nhas that exquisite juice which is so greatly sought after for the\r\npurpose of dyeing cloth, situate in the middle of the throat. This\r\nsecretion consists of a tiny drop contained in a white vein, from which\r\nthe precious liquid used for dyeing is distilled, being of the tint of\r\na rose somewhat inclining to black. The rest of the body is entirely\r\ndestitute of this juice. It is a great point to take the fish alive;\r\nfor when it dies, it spits out this juice. From the larger ones it is\r\nextracted after taking off the shell; but the small fish are crushed\r\nalive, together with the shells, upon which they eject this secretion.\r\n\r\nIn Asia the best purple is that of Tyre, in Africa that of Meninx[2666]\r\nand the parts of Gætulia that border on the Ocean, and in Europe that\r\nof Laconia. It is for this colour that the fasces and the axes[2667]\r\nof Rome make way in the crowd; it is this that asserts the majesty\r\nof childhood;[2668] it is this that distinguishes the senator[2669]\r\nfrom the man of equestrian rank; by persons arrayed in this colour are\r\nprayers[2670] addressed to propitiate the gods; on every garment[2671]\r\nit sheds a lustre, and in the triumphal vestment[2672] it is to be\r\nseen mingled with gold. Let us be prepared then to excuse this frantic\r\npassion for purple, even though at the same time we are compelled to\r\nenquire, why it is that such a high value has been set upon the produce\r\nof this shell-fish, seeing that while in the dye the smell of it is\r\noffensive, and the colour itself is harsh, of a greenish hue, and\r\nstrongly resembling that of the sea when in a tempestuous state?\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the purple is a finger[2673] in length, and by means of\r\nthis it finds subsistence, by piercing other shell-fish,[2674] so hard\r\nis the point of it. They die in fresh water, and in places where rivers\r\ndischarge themselves into the sea; otherwise, when taken, they will\r\nlive as long as fifty days on their saliva. All shell-fish grow very\r\nfast, and purples more especially; they come to their full size at the\r\nend of a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PURPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere I at this point to pass on to other subjects, luxury, no\r\ndoubt would think itself defrauded of its due, and so accuse me of\r\nnegligence; I must therefore make my way into the very workshops even,\r\nso that, just as among articles of food the various kinds and qualities\r\nof corn are known, all those who place the enjoyment of life in these\r\nluxuries, may have a still better acquaintance with the objects for\r\nwhich they live.[2675]\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of fish that produce the purple colour; the\r\nelements in both are the same, the combinations only are different;\r\nthe smaller fish is that which is called the “buccinum,” from its\r\nresemblance to the conch by which the sound of the buccinus or trumpet\r\nis produced, and to this circumstance it owes its name: the opening in\r\nit is round, with an incision in the margin.[2676] The other fish is\r\nknown as the “purpura,” or purple, and has a grooved and projecting\r\nmuzzle, which being tubulated on one side in the interior, forms a\r\npassage for the tongue;[2677] besides which, the shell is studded with\r\npoints up to the very apex, which are mostly seven in number, and\r\ndisposed[2678] in a circle; these are not found on the buccinum, though\r\nboth of them have as many spirals as they are years old. The buccinum\r\nattaches itself only to crags, and is gathered about rocky places.\r\n\r\n(37.) Purples also have another name, that of “pelagiæ”[2679] there\r\nare numerous kinds of them, which differ only in their element and\r\nplace of abode. There is the mud[2680] purple, which is nurtured upon\r\nputrid mud; and the sea-weed[2681] purple, which feeds on sea-weed;\r\nboth of which are held in the very lowest esteem. A better kind is\r\nthe reef-purple,[2682] which is collected on the reefs or out at sea;\r\nstill, however, the colour extracted from this is too light and thin.\r\nThen, again, there is the variety known as the pebble-purple,[2683]\r\nso called from the pebbles of the sea, and wonderfully well adapted\r\nfor dyeing; and, better than any of them, that known by the name of\r\n“dialutensis,”[2684] because of the various natures of the soil on\r\nwhich it feeds. Purples are taken with a kind of osier kipe[2685] of\r\nsmall size, and with large meshes; these are cast into the sea, and in\r\nthem cockles are put as a bait, that close the shell in an instant,\r\nand snap at an object, just as we see mussels do. Though half dead,\r\nthese animals, as soon as ever they are returned to the sea, come to\r\nlife again, and open their shells with avidity; upon which the purples\r\nseek them, and commence the attack, by protruding their tongues. The\r\ncockles, on the other hand, the moment they feel themselves pricked,\r\nshut their shells, and hold fast the object that has wounded them: in\r\nthis way, victims to their greediness, they are drawn up to the surface\r\nhanging by the tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62. (38.)—HOW WOOLS ARE DYED WITH THE JUICES OF THE PURPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most favourable season for taking these fish is after the\r\nrising of the Dog-star, or else before spring; for when they have\r\nonce discharged[2686] their waxy secretion, their juices have no\r\nconsistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers’ workshops,\r\nalthough it is a point of primary importance. After it is taken,\r\nthe vein is extracted, which we have[2687] previously spoken of, to\r\nwhich it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius[2688] about to every\r\nhundred pounds of juice. It is sufficient to leave them to steep for\r\na period of three days, and no more, for the fresher they are, the\r\ngreater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then set to boil in\r\nvessels of tin,[2689] and every hundred amphoræ[2690] ought to be\r\nboiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a\r\nmoderate heat; for which purpose the vessel is placed at the end of a\r\nlong funnel, which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling,\r\nthe liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh, which\r\nnecessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the\r\nwhole contents of the cauldron are in a liquified state, upon which a\r\nfleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it\r\nby way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to\r\nsatisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on\r\nthe boil. The tint that inclines to red is looked upon as inferior to\r\nthat which is of a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for\r\nfive hours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until it\r\nhas fully imbibed the colour. The juice of the buccinum is considered\r\nvery inferior if employed by itself, as it is found to discharge its\r\ncolour; but when used in conjunction with that of the pelagiæ, it\r\nblends[2691] with it very well, gives a bright lustre to its colour,\r\nwhich is otherwise too dark, and imparts the shining crimson hue of\r\nthe kermes-berry, a tint that is particularly valued. By the admixture\r\nof their respective virtues these colours are thus heightened or\r\nrendered sombre by the aid of one another. The proper proportions for\r\nmixing are, for fifty pounds of wool, two hundred pounds of juice of\r\nthe buccinum and one hundred and eleven of juice of the pelagiæ. From\r\nthis combination is produced the admirable tint known as amethyst\r\ncolour.[2692] To produce the Tyrian hue the wool is soaked in the juice\r\nof the pelagiæ while the mixture is in an uncooked and raw state; after\r\nwhich its tint is changed by being dipped in the juice of the buccinum.\r\nIt is considered of the best quality when it has exactly the colour of\r\nclotted blood, and is of a blackish hue to the sight, but of a shining\r\nappearance when held up to the light; hence it is that we find Homer\r\nspeaking of “purple blood.”[2693]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63. (39.)—WHEN PURPLE WAS FIRST USED AT ROME: WHEN THE LATICLAVE\r\nVESTMENT AND THE PRÆTEXTA WERE FIRST WORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find that, from the very first, purple has been in use at Rome, but\r\nthat Romulus employed it for the trabea.[2694] As to the toga prætexta\r\nand the laticlave[2695] vestment, it is a fact well ascertained, that\r\nTullus Hostilius was the first king who made use of them, and that\r\nafter the conquest of the Etruscans. Cornelius Nepos, who died in the\r\nreign of the late Emperor Augustus, has left the following remarks: “In\r\nthe days of my youth,” says he, “the violet purple was in favour, a\r\npound of which used to sell at one hundred denarii; and not long after,\r\nthe Tarentine[2696] red was all the fashion. This last was succeeded\r\nby the Tyrian dibapha,[2697] which could not be bought for even one\r\nthousand denarii per pound. P. Lentulus Spinther, the curule ædile, was\r\nthe first who used the dibapha for the prætexta, and he was greatly\r\ncensured for it; whereas now-a-days,” says he, “who is there that does\r\nnot have purple hangings[2698] to his banqueting-couches, even?”\r\n\r\nThis Spinther was ædile in the consulship of Cicero, and in the year\r\nfrom the Building of the City, 691. “Dibapha” was the name given to\r\ntextures that had been doubly dyed, and these were looked upon as a\r\nmighty piece of costly extravagance; while now, at the present day,\r\nnearly all the purple cloths that are reckoned of any account are dyed\r\nin a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64.—FABRICS CALLED CONCHYLIATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrics that are called conchyliated are subjected to the same process\r\nin all other respects, but without any admixture of the juice of the\r\nbuccinum; in addition to which, the liquid is mixed with water and\r\nhuman urine in equal parts,[2699] one-half[2700] only of the proportion\r\nof dye being used for the same quantity of wool. From this mixture a\r\nfull colour is not obtained, but that pale tint, which is so highly\r\nesteemed; and the clearer[2701] it is, the less of it the wool has\r\nimbibed.\r\n\r\n(40.) The prices of these dyes vary in proportion to the quantity\r\nproduced by the various shores; still, however, those who are in the\r\nhabit of paying enormous prices for them, may as well be informed that\r\non no occasion ought the juice of the pelagiæ to exceed fifty,[2702]\r\nand that of the buccinum one hundred sesterces for one hundred\r\npounds.[2703]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65.—THE AMETHYST, THE TYRIAN, THE HYSGINIAN, AND THE CRIMSON\r\nTINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut no sooner have we finished with one branch of this subject than we\r\nhave to begin upon another, for we find that it is made quite a matter\r\nof sport to create expense; and not only this, but the sport must be\r\ndoubled by making new mixtures and combinations, and falsifying over\r\nagain what was a falsification of the works of Nature already; such,\r\nfor instance, as staining tortoise-shell,[2704] alloying gold with\r\nsilver for the purpose of making electrum,[2705] and then adding copper\r\nto the mixture to make Corinthian metal.[2706]\r\n\r\n(41.) It was not sufficient to have borrowed from a precious stone the\r\nname of “amethyst” for a dye, but when we have obtained this colour\r\nwe must drench it over again with Tyrian tints,[2707] so that we may\r\nhave an upstart name[2708] compounded of both, and at the same moment a\r\ntwo-fold display of luxury; for as soon as ever people have succeeded\r\nin obtaining the conchyliated colour, they immediately begin to think\r\nthat it will do better as a state of transition to the Tyrian hues.\r\nThere can be little doubt that this invention is due to some artist\r\nwho happened to change his mind, and alter a tint with which he was\r\nnot pleased: hence a system has taken its rise, and spirits, ever on\r\nthe rack for creating wonders, have transformed what was originally\r\na blunder into something quite desirable; while, at the same time, a\r\ndouble path has been pointed out to luxury, in thus making one colour\r\ncarry another, and thereby become, as they say, softer and more mellow.\r\nAnd what is even more than this, human ingenuity has even learned to\r\nmingle with these dyes the productions of the earth, and to steep\r\nin Tyrian purple fabrics already dyed crimson with the berry of the\r\nkermes, in order to produce the hysginian[2709] tint. The kermes of\r\nGalatia, a red berry which we shall mention when we come to speak[2710]\r\nof the productions of the earth, is the most esteemed of all, except,\r\nperhaps, the one that grows in the vicinity of Emerita,[2711] in\r\nLusitania. However, to make an end, once for all, of my description of\r\nthese precious dyes, I shall remark, that the colour yielded by this\r\ngrain[2712] when a year old, is of a pallid hue, and that if it is more\r\nthan four years old, it is quickly discharged: hence we find that its\r\nenergies are not developed either when it is too young or when old.\r\n\r\nI have now abundantly treated of an art, by means of which men, just as\r\nmuch as women, have an idea that their appearance may be set off to the\r\ngreatest possible advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66. (42.)—THE PINNA, AND THE PINNOTHERES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelonging to the shell-fish tribe there is the pinna[2713] also: it is\r\nfound[2714] in slimy spots, always lying upright, and never without a\r\ncompanion, which some writers call the pinnotheres,[2715] and others,\r\nagain, pinnophylax, being a small kind of shrimp, or else a parasitical\r\ncrab. The pinna,[2716] which is destitute of sight, opens its shell,\r\nand in so doing exposes its body within to the attacks of the small\r\nfish, which immediately rush upon it, and finding that they can do so\r\nwith impunity, become bolder and bolder, till at last they quite fill\r\nthe shell. The pinnotheres, looking out for the opportunity, gives\r\nnotice to the pinna at the critical moment by a gentle bite, upon which\r\nthe other instantly closes its shell, and so kills whatever it has\r\ncaught there; after which, it divides the spoil with its companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67.—THE SENSITIVENESS OF WATER ANIMALS; THE TORPEDO, THE\r\nPASTINACA, THE SCOLOPENDRA, THE GLANIS, AND THE RAM-FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon[2717] reflecting on such facts as these, I am the more inclined\r\nto wonder at the circumstance that some persons have been found who\r\nwere of opinion that the water animals are devoid of all sense. The\r\ntorpedo[2718] is very well aware of the extent of its own powers, and\r\nthat, too, although it experiences no benumbing effects from them\r\nitself. Lying concealed in the mud, it awaits the approach of the\r\nfish, and, at the moment that they are swimming above in supposed\r\nsecurity, communicates the shock, and instantly darts upon them: there\r\nis no delicate[2719] morsel in existence that is preferred to the liver\r\nof this fish. And no less wonderful, too, is the shrewdness[2720]\r\nmanifested by the sea-frog,[2721] which is known by us as the “fisher.”\r\nStirring up the mud, it protrudes from the surface two little horns,\r\nwhich project from beneath the eyes, and so attracts the small fish\r\nwhich are sporting around it, until at last they approach so close that\r\nit is able to seize them. In a similar manner, too, the squatina and\r\nthe rhombus[2722] conceal themselves, but extend their fins, which,\r\nas they move to and fro, resemble little worms; the ray also does the\r\nsame. The pastinaca,[2723] too, lies lurking in ambush, and pierces\r\nthe fish as they pass with the sting with which it is armed. Another\r\nproof of instinctive shrewdness is the fact, that although the ray is\r\nthe very slowest of all the fish in its movements, it is found with the\r\nmullet in its belly, which is the swiftest of them all.\r\n\r\n(43.) The scolopendra,[2724] which bears a strong resemblance[2725]\r\nto the land insect which we call a centipede, if it chances to swallow\r\na hook, will vomit forth all its intestines, until it has disengaged\r\nitself, after which it will suck them in again. The sea-fox[2726] too,\r\nwhen exposed to a similar peril, goes on swallowing the line until it\r\nmeets with a weak part of it, and then with its teeth snaps it asunder\r\nwith the greatest ease. The fish called the glanis[2727] is more\r\ncautious; it bites at the hooks from behind, and does not swallow them,\r\nbut only strips them of the bait.\r\n\r\n(44.) The sea-ram[2728] commits its ravages just like a wary robber; at\r\none time it will lurk in the shadow of some large vessel that is lying\r\nout at sea, and wait for any one who may be tempted to swim; while at\r\nanother, it will raise its head from the surface of the water, survey\r\nthe fishermen’s boats, and then slily swim towards them and sink them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68. (45.)—BODIES WHICH HAVE A THIRD NATURE, THAT OF THE ANIMAL\r\nAND VEGETABLE COMBINED—THE SEA-NETTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, for my own part, I am strongly of opinion that there is sense\r\nexisting in those bodies which have the nature[2729] of neither animals\r\nnor vegetables, but a third which partakes of them both:—sea-nettles\r\nand sponges, I mean. The sea-nettle[2730] wanders to and fro by night,\r\nand at night changes its locality. These creatures are by nature a sort\r\nof fleshy branch,[2731] and are nurtured upon flesh. They have the\r\npower of producing an itching, smarting pain,[2732] just like that\r\ncaused by the nettle found on land. For the purpose of seeking its\r\nprey, it contracts and stiffens itself to the utmost possible extent,\r\nand then, as a small fish swims past, it will suddenly spread out its\r\nbranches, and so seize and devour[2733] it. At another time it will\r\nassume the appearance of being quite withered away, and let itself be\r\ntossed[2734] to and fro by the waves like a piece of sea-weed, until\r\nit happens to touch a fish. The moment it does so, the fish goes to\r\nrub itself against a rock, to get rid of the itching; immediately upon\r\nwhich, the nettle pounces upon it. By night also it is on the look-out\r\nfor scallops and sea-urchins. When it perceives a hand approaching it,\r\nit instantly changes its colour, and contracts itself; when touched it\r\nproduces a burning sensation, and if ever so short a time is afforded,\r\nmakes its escape. Its mouth is situate, it is said, at the root or\r\nlower part,[2735] and the excrements[2736] are discharged by a small\r\ncanal situated above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69.—SPONGES; THE VARIOUS KINDS OF THEM, AND WHERE THEY ARE\r\nPRODUCED: PROOFS THAT THEY ARE GIFTED WITH LIFE BY NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find three[2737] kinds of sponges mentioned; the first are thick,\r\nvery hard, and rough, and are called “tragi:”[2738] the second, are\r\nthick, and much softer, and are called “mani;”[2739] of the third,\r\nbeing fine and of a closer texture, tents for sores are made; this last\r\nis known as “Achillium.”[2740] All of these sponges grow on rocks, and\r\nfeed upon[2741] shell- and other fish, and slime. It would appear that\r\nthese creatures, too, have some intelligence; for as soon as ever they\r\nfeel[2742] the hand about to tear them off, they contract themselves,\r\nand are separated with much greater difficulty: they do the same also\r\nwhen the waves buffet them to and fro. The small shells that are found\r\nin them, clearly show that they live upon food: about Torone[2743] it\r\nis even said that they will survive after they have been detached, and\r\nthat they grow again from the roots which have been left adhering to\r\nthe rock. They leave a colour similar to that of blood upon the rock\r\nfrom which they have been detached, and those more especially which are\r\nproduced in the Syrtes of Africa.[2744]\r\n\r\nThe manos is the one that grows to the largest size, but the softest\r\nof all are those found in the vicinity of Lycia. Where the sea is\r\ndeep and calm, they are more particularly soft, while those which are\r\nfound in the Hellespont are rough, and those in the vicinity of Malea\r\ncoarse.[2745] When lying in places exposed to the sun, they become\r\nputrid: hence it is that those which are found in deep water are the\r\nbest. While they are alive, they are of the same blackish colour that\r\nthey are when saturated with water. They adhere to the rock not by\r\none part only, nor yet by the whole body: and within them there are a\r\nnumber of empty tubes, generally four or five in number, by means of\r\nwhich, it is thought, they take their food. There are other tubes also,\r\nbut these are closed at the upper extremity; and a sort of membrane\r\nis supposed to be spread beneath the roots by which they adhere. It\r\nis well known that sponges are very long-lived. The most inferior\r\nkind of all are those which are called “aplysiæ,”[2746] because it is\r\nimpossible to clean them: these have large tubes, while the other parts\r\nof them are thick and coarse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70. (46.)—DOG-FISH.[2747]\r\n\r\n\r\nVast numbers of dog-fish infest the seas in the vicinity of the\r\nsponges, to the great peril of those who dive for them. These persons\r\nsay that a sort of dense cloud gradually thickens over their[2748]\r\nheads, bearing the resemblance of some kind of animal like a\r\nflat-fish,[2749] and that, pressing downward upon them, it prevents\r\nthem from returning to the surface. It is for this reason that they\r\ncarry stilettos with them,[2750] which are very sharp at the point,\r\nand attached to them by strings; for if they did not pierce the object\r\nwith the help of these, it could not be got rid of. This, however,\r\nis entirely the result, in my opinion, of the darkness and their own\r\nfears; for no person has ever yet been able to find, among living\r\ncreatures, the fish-cloud or the fish-fog, the name which they give to\r\nthis enemy of theirs.\r\n\r\nThe divers, however, have terrible combats with the dog-fish, which\r\nattack with avidity the groin, the heels, and all the whiter parts\r\nof the body. The only means of ensuring safety, is to go boldly to\r\nmeet them, and so, by taking the initiative, strike them with alarm:\r\nfor, in fact, this animal is just as frightened at man, as man is at\r\nit; and they are on quite an equal footing when beneath the water.\r\nBut the moment the diver has reached the surface, the danger is much\r\nmore imminent; for he loses the power of boldly meeting his adversary\r\nwhile he is endeavouring to make his way out of the water, and his\r\nonly chance of safety is in his companions, who draw him along by a\r\ncord that is fastened under his shoulders. While he is engaging with\r\nthe enemy, he keeps pulling this cord with his left hand, according\r\nas there may be any sign of immediate peril, while with the right he\r\nwields the stiletto, which he is using in his defence. At first they\r\ndraw him along at a moderate pace, but as soon as ever they have got\r\nhim close to the ship, if they do not whip him out in an instant, with\r\nthe greatest possible celerity, they see him snapped asunder; and\r\nmany a time, too, the diver, even when already drawn out, is dragged\r\nfrom their hands, through neglecting to aid the efforts of those who\r\nare assisting him, by rolling up his body in the shape of a ball. The\r\nothers, it is true, are in the meantime brandishing their pronged\r\nfish-spears; but the monster has the craftiness to place himself\r\nbeneath the ship, and so wage the warfare in safety. Consequently,\r\nevery possible care is taken by the divers to look out[2751] for the\r\napproach of this enemy.\r\n\r\n(47.) It is the surest sign of safety to see flat-fish, which never\r\nfrequent the spots where these noxious monsters are found: and it is\r\nfor this reason that the divers[2752] call them sacred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 71.—FISHES WHICH ARE ENCLOSED IN A STONY SHELL—SEA ANIMALS WHICH\r\nHAVE NO SENSATION—-OTHER ANIMALS WHICH LIVE IN THE MUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose animals, however, it must be admitted, which lie enclosed in\r\na stony shell, have no sensation whatever—such as the oyster,[2753]\r\nfor instance. Many, again, have the same nature as vegetables; such\r\nas the holothuria,[2754] the pulmones,[2755] and the sea-stars.[2756]\r\nIndeed, I may say that there is no land production which has not its\r\nlike in the sea;[2757] no, not even those insects which frequent our\r\npublic-houses[2758] in summer, and are so troublesome with their nimble\r\nleaps, nor yet those which more especially make the human hair their\r\nplace of refuge; for these are often drawn up in a mass[2759] collected\r\naround the bait. This, too, is supposed to be the reason why the sleep\r\nof fish is sometimes so troubled in the night. Upon some fish, indeed,\r\nthese animals breed[2760] as parasites: among these, we find the fish\r\nknown as the chalcis.[2761]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 72. (48.)—VENOMOUS SEA-ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor yet are dire and venomous substances found wanting in the sea:\r\nsuch, for instance, as the sea-hare[2762] of the Indian seas, which\r\nis even poisonous by the very touch, and immediately produces vomiting\r\nand disarrangement of the stomach. In our seas it has the appearance\r\nof a shapeless mass, and only resembles the hare in colour; in India\r\nit resembles it in its larger size, and in its hair, which is only\r\nsomewhat coarser: there it is never taken alive. An equally deadly\r\nanimal is the sea-spider,[2763] which is especially dangerous for a\r\nsting which it has on the back: but there is nothing that is more\r\nto be dreaded than the sting which protrudes from the tail of the\r\ntrygon,[2764] by our people known as the pastinaca, a weapon five\r\ninches in length. Fixing this in the root of a tree, the fish is able\r\nto kill it; it can pierce armour too, just as though with an arrow, and\r\nto the strength of iron it adds all the corrosive qualities of poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 73. (49.)—THE MALADIES OF FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not find it stated that all kinds of fishes are subject to\r\nepizoötic diseases,[2765] like other animals of a wild nature: but it\r\nis evidently the fact that individuals[2766] among them are attacked by\r\nmaladies, from the emaciated appearance that many present, while at the\r\nsame moment others of the same species are taken quite remarkable for\r\ntheir fatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 74. (50.)—THE GENERATION OF FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curiosity and wonder which have been excited in mankind by this\r\nsubject, will not allow me any longer to defer giving an account\r\nof the generation of these animals. Fishes couple by rubbing their\r\nbellies[2767] against one another; an operation, however, that is\r\nperformed with such extraordinary celerity as to escape the sight.\r\nDolphins[2768] also, and other animals of the cetaceous kind, couple\r\nin a similar manner, though the time occupied in so doing is somewhat\r\nlonger. The female fish, at the season for coupling, follows the\r\nmale, and strikes against its belly with its muzzle; while the male\r\nin its turn, when the female is about to spawn, follows it and\r\ndevours[2769] the eggs. But with them, the simple act of coupling is\r\nnot sufficient[2770] for the purposes of reproduction; it is necessary\r\nfor the male to pass among the eggs which the female has produced,\r\nin order to sprinkle them with its vitalizing fluid. This does not,\r\nhowever, reach all the eggs out of so vast a multitude; indeed, if it\r\ndid, the seas and lakes would soon be filled, seeing that each female\r\nproduces these eggs in quantities innumerable.[2771]\r\n\r\n(51.) The eggs[2772] of fishes grow in the sea; some of them with the\r\ngreatest rapidity, those of the muræna, for instance; others, again,\r\nsomewhat more slowly. Those among the flat fishes,[2773] whose tails or\r\nstings are not in the way, as well as those of the turtle kind, couple\r\nthe one upon the other: the polypus by attaching one of its feelers to\r\nthe nostrils[2774] of the female, the sæpia and loligo, by means of\r\nthe tongue; uniting the arms, they then swim contrary ways; these last\r\nalso bring forth at the mouth. The polypi,[2775] however, couple with\r\nthe head downwards towards the ground, while the rest of the soft[2776]\r\nfish couple backwards in the same manner as the dog; cray-fish and\r\nshrimps do the same, and crabs employ the mouth.\r\n\r\nFrogs leap the one upon the other, the male with its fore-feet clasping\r\nthe armpits of the female, and with its hinder ones the haunches. The\r\nfemale produces tiny pieces of black flesh, which are known by the\r\nname of gyrini,[2777] and are only to be distinguished by the eyes\r\nand tail; very soon, however, the feet are developed, and the tail,\r\nbecoming bifurcate, forms the hind legs. It is a most singular thing,\r\nbut, after a life of six months’ duration, frogs melt away[2778] into\r\nslime, though no one ever sees how it is done; after which they come\r\nto life again in the water during the spring, just as they were[2779]\r\nbefore. This is effected by some occult operation of Nature, and\r\nhappens regularly every year.\r\n\r\nMussels, also, and scallops are produced in the sand by the\r\nspontaneous[2780] operations of nature. Those which have a harder\r\nshell, such as the murex and the purple, are formed from a viscous\r\nfluid like saliva, just as gnats are produced from liquids turned\r\nsour,[2781] and the fish called the apua,[2782] from the foam of the\r\nsea when warm, after the fall of a shower.\r\n\r\nThose fish, again, which are covered with a stony coat, such as the\r\noyster, are produced from mud in a putrid state, or else from the\r\nfoam that has collected around ships which have been lying for a long\r\ntime in the same position, about posts driven into the earth, and\r\nmore especially around logs of wood.[2783] It has been discovered, of\r\nlate years, in the oyster-beds,[2784] that the animal discharges an\r\nimpregnating liquid,[2785] which has the appearance of milk. Eels,\r\nagain, rub themselves against rocks, upon which, the particles[2786]\r\nwhich they thus scrape from off their bodies come to life, such being\r\ntheir only means of reproduction. The various kinds of fishes do not\r\ncouple out of their own kind, with the exception of the squatina and\r\nthe ray.[2787] The fish that is produced from the union of these two,\r\nresembles a ray in the fore part, and bears a name among the Greeks\r\ncompounded of the two.[2788]\r\n\r\nCertain animals are produced only at certain seasons of the year, both\r\nin water and on the land, such, for instance, as scallops, snails,\r\nand leeches, in the spring, which also disappear at stated periods.\r\nAmong fishes, the wolf-fish[2789] and the trichias[2790] bring forth\r\ntwice in the year, as also do all kinds of rock-fish; the mullet and\r\nthe chalcis[2791] thrice in the year, the cyprinus[2792] six times,\r\nthe scorpæna[2793] twice, and the sargus in spring and autumn. Among\r\nthe flat-fish, the squatina brings forth twice a year, being the\r\nonly[2794] one that does so at the setting of the[2795] Vergiliæ in\r\nautumn. Most fish spawn in the three months of April, May, and June.\r\nThe salpa brings forth in the autumn, the sargus, the torpedo, and\r\nthe squalus[2796] about the time of the autumnal equinox. The soft\r\nfishes[2797] bring forth in spring, the sæpia every month in the year;\r\nits eggs adhere together with a kind of black glutinous substance, in\r\nappearance like a bunch of grapes, and the male is very careful to go\r\namong them and breathe[2798] upon them, as otherwise they would be\r\nbarren. The polypi couple in winter, and produce eggs in the spring\r\ntwisted in spiral clusters, in a similar manner to the tendrils of\r\nthe vine; and so remarkably prolific are they, that when the animal\r\nis killed in a state of pregnancy, the cavities of the head are quite\r\nunable to contain the multitude[2799] of eggs enclosed therein. They\r\nbring forth these eggs at the fiftieth day, but in consequence of\r\nthe vast number of them, great multitudes perish. Cray-fish, and\r\nother sea-animals with a thinner crust, lay their eggs one upon the\r\nother, and then sit upon them. The female polypus sometimes sits upon\r\nits eggs, and at other times closes the entrance of its retreat by\r\nspreading out its feelers, interlaced like a net. The sæpia brings\r\nforth on dry land, among reeds or such sea-weed as it may find growing\r\nthere, and hatches its eggs on the fifteenth day. The loligo produces\r\nits eggs out at sea, clustered together like those of the sæpia. The\r\npurple,[2800] the murex, and other fishes of the same kind, bring forth\r\nin the spring. Sea-urchins have their eggs at full moon during the\r\nwinter; sea-snails[2801] also are produced during the winter season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 75.—FISHES WHICH ARE BOTH OVIPAROUS AND VIVIPAROUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe torpedo is known to have as many as eighty young ones. It\r\nproduces within itself[2802] very soft eggs, which it then transfers\r\nto another place in the uterus, and from that part ejects them. The\r\nsame is the case with all those fish to which we have given the name\r\nof cartilaginous; hence it is, that these alone of all the fishes are\r\nat once viviparous and oviparous. The male silurus[2803] is the only\r\nfish among them all that watches the eggs after they are brought forth,\r\noften for as long a period as fifty days, that they may not be devoured\r\nby other fish. The females of other kinds bring forth their eggs in the\r\ncourse of three days, if the male has only touched them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 76.—FISHES THE BELLY OF WHICH OPENS IN SPAWNING, AND THEN CLOSES\r\nAGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea-needle,[2804] or the belone, is the only fish in which the\r\nmultitude of its eggs, in spawning, causes the belly to open asunder;\r\nbut immediately after it has brought forth, the wound heals again: a\r\nthing which, it is said, is the case with the blind-worm as well. The\r\nsea-mouse[2805] digs a hole in the earth, deposits its eggs there, and\r\nthen covers them up. On the thirtieth day it opens the hole, and leads\r\nits young to the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 77. (52.)—FISHES WHICH HAVE A WOMB; THOSE WHICH IMPREGNATE\r\nTHEMSELVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fishes called the erythinus[2806] and the channe[2807] are said to\r\nhave a womb; and those which by the Greeks are called trochi,[2808] it\r\nis said, impregnate themselves. The young of all aquatic animals are\r\nwithout sight at their birth.[2809]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 78. (53.)—THE LONGEST LIVES KNOWN AMONGST FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have lately heard of a remarkable instance of length of life in\r\nfish. Pausilypum[2810] is the name of a villa in Campania, not far\r\nfrom Neapolis; here, as we learn from the works of M. Annæus Seneca, a\r\nfish is known to have died sixty years after it had been placed in the\r\npreserves of Cæsar[2811] by Vedius Pollio; while others of the same\r\nkind, and its equals in age, were living at the time that he wrote.\r\nThis mention of fish-preserves reminds me that I ought to mention a\r\nfew more particulars connected with this subject, before we leave the\r\naquatic animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 79. (54.)—THE FIRST PERSON THAT FORMED ARTIFICIAL OYSTER-BEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first person who formed artificial oyster-beds was Sergius\r\nOrata,[2812] who established them at Baiæ, in the time of L. Crassus,\r\nthe orator, just before the Marsic War. This was done by him, not\r\nfor the gratification of gluttony, but of avarice, as he contrived\r\nto make a large income by this exercise of his ingenuity. He was the\r\nfirst, too, to invent hanging baths,[2813] and after buying villas and\r\ntrimming them up, he would every now and then sell them again.[2814]\r\nHe, too, was the first to adjudge the pre-eminence for delicacy of\r\nflavour to the oysters of Lake Lucrinus;[2815] for every kind of\r\naquatic animal is superior in one place to what it is in another. Thus,\r\nfor instance, the wolf-fish of the river Tiber is the best that is\r\ncaught between the two bridges,[2816] and the turbot of Ravenna is the\r\nmost esteemed, the murena of Sicily, the elops of Rhodes; the same,\r\ntoo, as to the other kinds, not to go through all the items of the\r\nculinary catalogue. The British[2817] shores had not as yet sent their\r\nsupplies, at the time when Orata thus ennobled the Lucrine oysters: at\r\na later period, however, it was thought worth while to fetch oysters\r\nall the way from Brundisium, at the very extremity of Italy; and in\r\norder that there might exist no rivalry[2818] between the two flavours,\r\na plan has been more recently hit upon, of feeding the oysters of\r\nBrundisium in Lake Lucrinus, famished as they must naturally be after\r\nso long a journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 80.—WHO WAS THE FIRST INVENTOR OF PRESERVES FOR OTHER FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same age, also, Licinius Murena[2819] was the first to form\r\npreserves for other fish; and his example was soon followed by the\r\nnoble families of the Philippi and the Hortensii. Lucullus had a\r\nmountain pierced near Naples, at a greater outlay even, than that which\r\nhad been expended on his villa; and here he formed a channel,[2820] and\r\nadmitted the sea to his preserves; it was for this reason that Pompeius\r\nMagnus gave him the name of “Xerxes in a toga.”[2821] After his\r\ndeath, the fish in his preserves was sold for the sum of four million\r\nsesterces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 81. (55.)—WHO INVENTED PRESERVES FOR MURENÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Hirrus[2822] was the first person who formed preserves for the\r\nmurena; and it was he who lent six thousand of these fishes for the\r\ntriumphal banquets of Cæsar the Dictator; on which occasion he had them\r\nduly weighed, as he declined to receive the value of them in money or\r\nany other commodity. His villa, which was of a very humble character in\r\nthe interior, sold for four millions[2823] of sesterces, in consequence\r\nof the valuable nature of the stock-ponds there. Next after this, there\r\narose a passion for individual fish. At Bauli,[2824] in the territory\r\nof Baiæ, the orator Hortensius had some fish-preserves, in which there\r\nwas a murena to which he became so much attached, as to be supposed\r\nto have wept on hearing of its death.[2825] It was at the same villa\r\nthat Antonia,[2826] the wife of Drusus, placed earrings upon a murena\r\nwhich she had become fond of; the report of which singular circumstance\r\nattracted many visitors to the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 82. (56.)—WHO INVENTED PRESERVES FOR SEA-SNAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFulvius Lupinus[2827] first formed preserves for sea-snails,[2828] in\r\nthe territory of Tarquinii, shortly before the civil war between Cæsar\r\nand Pompeius Magnus. He also carefully distinguished them by their\r\nseveral species, separating them from one another. The white ones\r\nwere those that are produced in the district of Reate;[2829] those of\r\nIllyria were remarkable for the largeness of their size; while those\r\nfrom Africa were the most prolific; those, however, from the Promontory\r\nof the Sun[2830] were the most esteemed of all. For the purpose,\r\nalso, of fattening them, he invented a mixture of boiled wine,[2831]\r\nspelt-meal, and other substances; so that fattened periwinkles even\r\nbecame quite an object of gastronomy; and the art of breeding them\r\nwas brought to such a pitch of perfection, that the shell of a single\r\nanimal would hold as much as eighty quadrantes.[2832] This we learn\r\nfrom M. Varro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 83. (57.)—LAND FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are still some wonderful kinds of fishes[2833]\r\nwhich we find mentioned by Theophrastus: he says, that when the waters\r\nsubside, which have been admitted for the purposes of irrigation in the\r\nvicinity of Babylon, there are certain fish which remain in such holes\r\nas may contain water; from these they come forth for the purpose of\r\nfeeding, moving along with their fins by the aid of a rapid movement of\r\nthe tail. If pursued, he says, they retreat to their holes, and, when\r\nthey have reached them, will turn round and make a stand. The head is\r\nlike that of the sea-frog, while the other parts are similar to those\r\nof the gobio,[2834] and they have gills like other fish. He says also,\r\nthat in the vicinity of Heraclea and Cromna,[2835] and about the river\r\nLycus, as well as in many parts of the Euxine, there is one kind of\r\nfish[2836] which frequents the waters near the banks of the rivers, and\r\nmakes holes for itself, in which it lives, even when the water retires\r\nand the bed of the river is dry; for which reason these fishes have to\r\nbe dug out of the ground, and only show by the movement of the body\r\nthat they are still alive. He says also, that in the vicinity of the\r\nsame Heraclea, when the river Lycus ebbs, the eggs are left in the mud,\r\nand that the fish, on being produced from these, go forth to seek their\r\nfood by means of a sort of fluttering motion,—their gills being but\r\nvery small, in consequence of which they are not in need of water; for\r\nthis reason it is that eels also can live so long out of water;[2837]\r\nand that their eggs come to maturity on dry land, like those of the\r\nsea-tortoise[2838]. In the same regions also of the Euxine, he says,\r\nvarious kinds of fishes are overtaken by the ice, the gobio more\r\nparticularly, and they only betray signs of life, by moving when they\r\nhave warmth applied by the saucepan. All these things, however, though\r\nvery remarkable, still admit of some explanation. He tells us also,\r\nthat in Paphlagonia, land fishes are dug up that are most excellent\r\neating; these, he says, are found in deep holes or spots where there\r\nis no standing water whatever, and he expresses his surprise at their\r\nbeing thus produced without any contact with moisture, stating it as\r\nhis opinion, that there is some innate virtue in these holes,[2839]\r\nsimilar to that of wells; as if, indeed, fishes really were to be found\r\nin wells.[2840] However this may be, these facts, at all events, render\r\nthe life of the mole under ground less a matter for surprise; unless,\r\nperhaps, these fishes mentioned by Theophrastus are similar in nature\r\nto the earth-worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 84. (58.)—THE MICE OF THE NILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut all these things, singular as they are, are rendered credible by\r\na marvel which exceeds them all, at the time of the inundation of the\r\nNile; for, the moment that it subsides, little mice[2841] are found,\r\nthe first rudiments of which have been formed by the generative powers\r\nof the waters and the earth: in one part of the body they are already\r\nalive, while in that which is of later formation, they are still\r\ncomposed of earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 85. (59.)—HOW THE FISH CALLED THE ANTHIAS IS TAKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor would it be right to omit what is said about the fish called\r\nanthias, and which I find is looked upon as true by most writers. I\r\nhave already mentioned[2842] the Chelidoniæ, certain islands off the\r\ncoast of Asia; they are situate off a promontory there, in the midst\r\nof a sea full of crags and reefs. These parts are much frequented by\r\nthis fish, which is very speedily taken by the employment of a single\r\nmethod of catching it. A fisherman pushes out in a little boat, dressed\r\nin a colour resembling that of his boat; and every day, for several\r\ndays together, at the same hour, he sails over the same space, while\r\ndoing which he throws a quantity of bait into the sea. Whatever is\r\nthrown from the boat is an object of suspicion to the fish, who keep\r\nat a distance from what causes them so much alarm; but after this\r\nhas been repeated a considerable number of times, one of the fish,\r\nreassured by becoming habituated to the scene, at last snaps at the\r\nbait. The movements of this one are watched with the greatest care and\r\nattention, for in it are centred all the hopes of the fishermen, as\r\nit is to be the means of securing them their prey; nor, indeed, is it\r\ndifficult to recognize it, seeing that for some days it is the only one\r\nthat ventures to come near the bait. At last, however, it finds some\r\nothers to follow its example, and by degrees it is better and better\r\nattended, till at last it brings with it shoals innumerable. The older\r\nones, at length becoming quite accustomed to the fisherman, easily\r\nrecognize him, and will even take food from his hands. Upon this, the\r\nman throws out, a little way beyond the tips of his fingers, a hook\r\nconcealed in a bait, and smuggles them out one by one, rather than\r\ncatches them, standing in the shadow of the boat and whipping them out\r\nof the water with a slight jerk, that the others may not perceive it;\r\nwhile another fisherman is ready inside to receive them upon pieces of\r\ncloth, in order that no floundering about or other noise may scare the\r\nothers away. It is of importance to know which has been the betrayer\r\nof the others, and not to take it, otherwise the shoal will take to\r\nflight, and appear no more for the future.[2843] There is a story that\r\na fisherman, having quarrelled once with his mate, threw out a hook\r\nto one of these leading fishes, which he easily recognized, and so\r\ncaptured it with a malicious intent. The fish, however, was recognized\r\nin the market by the other fisherman, against whom he had conceived\r\nthis malice; who accordingly brought an action against him for\r\ndamages;[2844] and, as Mucianus adds, he was condemned to pay them on\r\nthe hearing of the case. These anthiæ, it is said, when they see one of\r\ntheir number taken with a hook, cut the line with the serrated spines\r\nwhich they have on the back, the one that is held fast stretching it\r\nout as much as it can, to enable them to cut it. But among the sargi,\r\nthe fish itself, that is held fast, rubs the line asunder against the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 86. (60.)—SEA-STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to what I have already stated, I find that authors,\r\ndistinguished for their wisdom, express surprise at finding a star in\r\nthe sea—for such, in fact, is the form of the animal, which has but\r\nvery little flesh[2845] within, and nothing but a hard skin without. It\r\nis said that in this fish there is such a fiery heat, that it scorches\r\neverything it meets with in the sea, and instantaneously digests its\r\nfood. By what experiments[2846] all this came to be known, I cannot so\r\neasily say; but I am about to make mention of one fact which is more\r\nremarkable still, and which we have the opportunity of testing by every\r\nday’s experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 87. (61.)—THE MARVELLOUS PROPERTIES OF THE DACTYLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelonging also to the class of shell-fish is the dactylus,[2847] a fish\r\nso called from its strong resemblance to the human nails. It is the\r\nproperty of these fish to shine brightly in the dark, when all other\r\nlights are removed, and the more moisture they have, the brighter is\r\nthe light they emit. In the mouth even, while they are being eaten,\r\nthey give forth their light, and the same too when in the hands; the\r\nvery drops, in fact, that fall from them on the ground, or on the\r\nclothes, are of the same nature. Hence it is beyond a doubt, that it is\r\na liquid that possesses this peculiar property, which, even in a solid\r\nbody, would be a ground for considerable surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 88. (62.)—THE ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES THAT EXIST BETWEEN\r\nAQUATIC ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also marvellous instances to be found of antipathies and\r\nsympathies existing between them. The mullet and the wolf-fish[2848]\r\nare animated with a mutual hatred; and so too, the conger and the\r\nmurena gnaw each other’s[2849] tails. The cray-fish has so great\r\na dread of the polypus, that if it sees it near, it expires in an\r\ninstant: the conger dreads the cray-fish; while, again, the conger\r\ntears the body of the polypus. Nigidius informs us that the wolf-fish\r\ngnaws the tail of the mullet, and yet that, during certain months, they\r\nare on terms of friendship; all those, however, which thus lose their\r\ntails, survive their misfortune. On the other hand, in addition to\r\nthose which we have already mentioned as going in company together, an\r\ninstance of friendship is found in the balæna and the musculus,[2850]\r\nfor, as the eye-brows of the former are very heavy, they sometimes fall\r\nover its eyes, and quite close them by their ponderousness, upon which\r\nthe musculus swims before, and points out the shallow places which are\r\nlikely to prove inconvenient to its vast bulk,[2851] thus serving it\r\nin the stead of eyes. We shall now have to speak of the nature of the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSummary.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, 650.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoman authors quoted.—Turranius Gracilis,[2852] Trogus,[2853]\r\nMæcenas,[2854] Alfius Flavus,[2855] Cornelius Nepos,[2856] Laberius the\r\nMimographer,[2857] Fabianus,[2858] Fenestella,[2859] Mucianus,[2860]\r\nÆlius Stilo,[2861] Statius Sebosus,[2862] Melissus,[2863]\r\nSeneca,[2864] Cicero,[2865] Æmilius Macer,[2866] Messala\r\nCorvinus,[2867] Trebius Niger,[2868] Nigidius.[2869]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForeign authors quoted.—Aristotle,[2870] King Archelaus,[2871]\r\nCallimachus,[2872] Democritus,[2873] Theophrastus,[2874]\r\nThrasyllus,[2874] Hegesidemus,[2875] Cythnius,[2876] Alexander\r\nPolyhistor.[2877]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 1. (1.)—THE OSTRICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the birds[2878] follows next, the very largest of which,\r\nand indeed almost approaching to the nature of quadrupeds, is the\r\nostrich[2879] of Africa or[2880] Æthiopia. This bird exceeds in height\r\na man sitting on horseback, and can surpass him in swiftness, as wings\r\nhave been given to aid it in running; in other respects ostriches\r\ncannot be considered as birds, and do not raise themselves from the\r\nearth. They have cloven talons, very similar to the hoof[2881] of the\r\nstag; with these they fight, and they also employ them in seizing\r\nstones for the purpose of throwing[2882] at those who pursue them.\r\nThey have the marvellous property of being able to digest[2883] every\r\nsubstance without distinction, but their stupidity[2884] is no less\r\nremarkable; for although the rest of their body is so large, they\r\nimagine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that\r\nthe whole of the body is concealed. Their eggs[2885] are prized on\r\naccount of their large size, and are employed as vessels for certain\r\npurposes, while the feathers of the wing and tail are used as ornaments\r\nfor the crest and helmet of the warrior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (2.)—THE PHŒNIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆthiopia and India, more especially, produce[2886] birds of diversified\r\nplumage, and such as quite surpass all description. In the front rank\r\nof these is the phœnix,[2887] that famous bird of Arabia; though I\r\nam not quite sure that its existence is not all a fable. It is said\r\nthat there is only one in existence in the whole world, and that that\r\none has not been seen very often. We are told that this bird is of the\r\nsize of an eagle,[2888] and has a brilliant golden plumage around the\r\nneck, while the rest of the body is of a purple colour; except the\r\ntail, which is azure, with long feathers intermingled of a roseate\r\nhue; the throat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft of\r\nfeathers. The first Roman who described this bird, and who has done so\r\nwith the greatest exactness, was the senator Manilius, so famous for\r\nhis learning; which he owed, too, to the instructions of no teacher.\r\nHe tells us that no person has ever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia\r\nit is looked upon as sacred to the sun, that it lives five hundred\r\nand forty years,[2889] that when it becomes old it builds a nest of\r\ncassia and sprigs of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then\r\nlays its body down upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow\r\nthere springs at first a sort of small worm, which in time changes into\r\na little bird: that the first thing that it does is to perform the\r\nobsequies of its predecessor, and to carry the nest entire to the city\r\nof the Sun near Panchaia,[2890] and there deposit it upon the altar of\r\nthat divinity.\r\n\r\nThe same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the great\r\nyear[2891] is completed with the life of this bird, and that then a\r\nnew cycle comes round again with the same characteristics as the former\r\none, in the seasons and the appearance of the stars; and he says that\r\nthis begins about mid-day of the day on which the sun enters the sign\r\nof Aries. He also tells us that when he wrote to the above effect,\r\nin the consulship[2892] of P. Licinius and Cneius Cornelius, it was\r\nthe two hundred and fifteenth year of the said revolution. Cornelius\r\nValerianus says that the phœnix took its flight from Arabia into Egypt\r\nin the consulship[2893] of Q. Plautius and Sextus Papinius. This bird\r\nwas brought to Rome in the censorship of the Emperor Claudius, being\r\nthe year from the building of the City, 800, and it was exposed to\r\npublic view in the Comitium.[2894] This fact is attested by the public\r\nAnnals, but there is no one that doubts that it was a fictitious phœnix\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (3.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF EAGLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the birds with which we are acquainted, the eagle is looked upon\r\nas the most noble, and the most remarkable for its strength. There are\r\nsix[2895] different kinds; the one called “melanaetos”[2896] by the\r\nGreeks, and “valeria” in our language, the least in size of them all,\r\nbut the most remarkable for its strength, is of a blackish colour. It\r\nis the only one among all the eagles that feeds its young; for the\r\nothers, as we shall mention just now, drive them away; it is the only\r\none too that has neither cry nor murmur; it is an inhabitant of the\r\nmountains. The second kind is the pygargus,[2897] an inhabitant of the\r\ncities and plains, and distinguished by the whiteness of its tail. The\r\nthird is the morphnos,[2898] which Homer also calls the “percnos,”\r\nwhile others, again, call it the “plangus” and the “anataria;” it is\r\nthe second in size and strength, and dwells in the vicinity of lakes.\r\nPhemonoë, who was styled the “daughter of Apollo,” has stated that this\r\neagle has teeth, but that it has neither voice nor tongue; she says\r\nalso that it is the blackest of all the eagles, and has a longer tail\r\nthan the rest; Bœus is of the same opinion. This eagle has the instinct\r\nto break the shell of the tortoise by letting it fall from aloft, a\r\ncircumstance which caused the death of the poet Æschylus. An oracle, it\r\nis said, had predicted his death on that day by the fall of a house,\r\nupon which he took the precaution of trusting himself only under the\r\ncanopy of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe fourth kind of eagle is the “percnopterus,”[2899] also called the\r\n“oripelargus;”[2900] it has much the appearance of the vulture, with\r\nremarkably small wings, while the rest of the body is larger than the\r\nothers; but it is of a timid and degenerate nature, so much so, that\r\neven a raven can beat it. It is always famishing and ravenous, and has\r\na plaintive murmuring cry. It is the only one among the eagles that\r\nwill carry off the dead carcase; the others settle on the spot where\r\nthey have killed their prey. The character of this species causes the\r\nfifth one to be known by the distinctive name of “gnesios,”[2901] as\r\nbeing the genuine eagle, and the only one of untainted lineage; it is\r\nof moderate size, of rather reddish colour, and rarely to be met with.\r\nThe haliætus[2902] is the last, and is remarkable for its bright and\r\npiercing eye. It poises itself aloft, and the moment it catches sight\r\nof a fish in the sea below, pounces headlong upon it, and cleaving the\r\nwater with its breast, carries off its prey.\r\n\r\nThe eagle which we have mentioned as forming the third species, pursues\r\nthe aquatic birds in the vicinity of standing waters: in order to make\r\ntheir escape they plunge into the water every now and then, until at\r\nlength they are overtaken by lassitude and sleep, upon which the eagle\r\nimmediately seizes them. The contest that takes place is really a sight\r\nworthy to be seen. The bird makes for the shore to seek a refuge, and\r\nespecially if there should happen to be a bed of reeds there; while\r\nin the meantime the eagle endeavours to drive it away with repeated\r\nblows of its wings, and tumbles into the water in its attempts to seize\r\nit. While it is standing on the shore its shadow is seen by the bird,\r\nwhich immediately dives beneath, and then making its way in an opposite\r\ndirection, emerges at some point at which it thinks it is the least\r\nlikely to be looked for. This is the reason why these birds swim in\r\nflocks, for when in large numbers they are in no danger from the enemy;\r\nas by dashing up the spray with their wings they blind him.\r\n\r\nAgain, it often happens that the eagle is not able to carry the bird\r\naloft on account of its weight, and in consequence they both of them\r\nsink together. The haliætus, and this one only, beats its young ones\r\nwhile in an unfledged state, with its wings, and forces[2903] them\r\nfrom time to time to look steadily upon the rays of the sun; and if it\r\nsees either of them wink, or even its eye water, it throws it headlong\r\nout of the nest, as being spurious and degenerate, while, on the\r\nother hand, it rears the one whose gaze remains fixed and steady. The\r\nhaliætus[2904] is not a species of itself, but is an eagle of mixed\r\nbreed: hence their produce are of the species known as the ossifrage,\r\nfrom which again is produced the smaller vulture; while this in its\r\nturn produces the large vulture, which, however, is quite barren.\r\n\r\nSome writers add to the above a seventh kind, which they call the\r\n“bearded”[2905] eagle; the Tuscans, however, call it the ossifrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—THE NATURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EAGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first three and the fifth class of eagles employ in the\r\nconstruction of their aerie the stone aëtites,[2906] by some known as\r\n“gangites;” which is employed also for many remedial purposes, and is\r\nproof against the action of fire. This stone has the quality also, in a\r\nmanner, of being pregnant, for when shaken, another stone is heard to\r\nrattle within, just as though it were enclosed in its womb; it has no\r\nmedical properties, however, except immediately after it has been taken\r\nfrom the nest.\r\n\r\nEagles build among rocks and trees; they lay three eggs, and generally\r\nhatch but two young ones, though occasionally as many as three have\r\nbeen seen. Being weary of the trouble of rearing both, they drive one\r\nof them from the nest: for just at this time the providential foresight\r\nof Nature has denied them a sufficiency of food, thereby using due\r\nprecaution that the young of all the other animals should not become\r\ntheir prey. During this period, also, their talons become reversed,\r\nand their feathers grow white from continued hunger, so that it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that they take a dislike to their young. The\r\nossifrage, however, a kindred species, takes charge of the young ones\r\nthus rejected, and rears them with its own; but the parent bird still\r\npursues them with hostility, even when grown up, and drives them away,\r\nas being its rivals in rapine. And indeed, under any circumstances, one\r\npair of eagles requires a very considerable space of ground to forage\r\nover, in order to find sufficient sustenance; for which reason it is\r\nthat they mark out by boundaries their respective allotments, and seek\r\ntheir prey in succession to one another. They do not immediately carry\r\noff their prey, but first deposit it on the ground, and it is only\r\nafter they have tested its weight that they fly away with it.\r\n\r\nThey die, not of old age, nor yet of sickness, or of hunger; but the\r\nupper part of the beak grows to such an extent, and becomes so curved,\r\nthat they are unable to open it. They take the wing, and begin upon the\r\nlabours of the chase at mid-day; sitting in idleness during the hours\r\nof the morning, until such time as the places[2907] of public resort\r\nare filled with people. The feathers of the eagle, if mixed with those\r\nof other birds, will consume them.[2908] It is said that this is the\r\nonly bird that has never been killed by lightning; hence it is, that\r\nusage has pronounced it to be the armour-bearer of Jove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (4.)—WHEN THE EAGLE WAS FIRST USED AS THE STANDARD OF THE\r\nROMAN LEGIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaius Marius, in his second consulship, assigned the eagle exclusively\r\nto the Roman legions. Before that period it had only held the first\r\nrank, there being four others as well, the wolf, the minotaur,\r\nthe horse, and the wild boar, each of which preceded a single\r\ndivision.[2909] Some few years before his time it had begun to be\r\nthe custom to carry the eagle only into battle, the other standards\r\nbeing left behind in camp; Marius, however, abolished the rest of them\r\nentirely. Since then, it has been remarked that hardly ever has a Roman\r\nlegion encamped for the winter, without a pair of eagles making their\r\nappearance at the spot.\r\n\r\nThe first and second species of eagle, not only prey upon the whole\r\nof the smaller quadrupeds, but will attack deer even. Rolling in the\r\ndust, the eagle covers its body all over with it, and then perching\r\non the antlers of the animal, shakes the dust into its eyes, while\r\nat the same time it beats it on the head with its wings, until the\r\ncreature at last precipitates itself down the rocks. Nor, indeed, is\r\nthis one enemy sufficient for it; it has still more terrible combats\r\nwith the dragon,[2910] and the issue is much more doubtful, although\r\nthe battle is fought in the air. The dragon seeks the eggs of the eagle\r\nwith a mischievous avidity; while the eagle, in return, carries it off\r\nwhenever it happens to see it; upon these occasions, the dragon coils\r\nitself about the wings of the bird in multiplied folds, until at last\r\nthey fall to the earth together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (5.)—AN EAGLE WHICH PRECIPITATED ITSELF ON THE FUNERAL PILE OF\r\nA GIRL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a very famous story about an eagle at the city of Sestos.\r\nHaving been reared by a little girl, it used to testify its gratitude\r\nfor her kindness, first by bringing her birds, and in due time various\r\nkinds of prey: at last she died, upon which the bird threw itself on\r\nthe lighted pile, and was consumed with her body. In memory of this\r\nevent, the inhabitants raised upon the spot what they called an heroic\r\nmonument,[2911] in honour of Jupiter and the damsel, the eagle being a\r\nbird consecrated to that divinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (6.)—THE VULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the vultures, the black ones[2912] are the strongest. No person has\r\nyet found a vulture’s nest: hence it is that there are some who have\r\nthought, though erroneously, that these birds come from the opposite\r\nhemisphere.[2913] The fact is, that they build their nest upon the\r\nvery highest rocks; their young ones, indeed, are often to be seen,\r\nbeing generally two in number. Umbricius, the most skilful among the\r\naruspices of our time, says that the vulture lays thirteen eggs,[2914]\r\nand that with one of these eggs[2915] it purifies the others and its\r\nnest, and then throws it away: he states also that they hover about for\r\nthree[2916] days, over the spot where carcases are about to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (7.)—THE BIRDS CALLED SANGUALIS AND IMMUSULUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable argument among the Roman augurs about\r\nthe birds known as the “sangualis” and the “immusulus.” Some persons\r\nare of opinion that the immusulus is the young of the vulture, and\r\nthe sangualis that of the ossifrage. Massurius says,[2917] that the\r\nsangualis is the same as the ossifrage, and that the immusulus is the\r\nyoung of the eagle, before the tail begins to turn white. Some persons\r\nhave asserted that these birds have not been seen at Rome since the\r\ntime of the augur Mucius; for my part, I think it much more likely,\r\nthat, amid that general heedlessness as to all knowledge, which has of\r\nlate prevailed, no notice has been taken of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (8.)—HAWKS. THE BUTEO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find no less than sixteen[2918] kinds of hawks mentioned; among\r\nthese are the ægithus, which is lame[2919] of one leg, and is looked\r\nupon as the most favourable omen for the augurs on the occasion of a\r\nmarriage, or in matters connected with property in the shape of cattle:\r\nthe triorchis also, so called from the number of its testicles,[2920]\r\nand to which Phemonoë has assigned the first rank in augury. This last\r\nis by the Romans known as the “buteo;” indeed there is a family[2921]\r\nthat has taken its surname from it, from the circumstance of this bird\r\nhaving given a favourable omen by settling upon the ship of one of them\r\nwhen he held a command. The Greeks call one kind[2922] “epileus;” the\r\nonly one, indeed, that is seen at all seasons of the year, the others\r\ntaking their departure in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds are distinguished by the avidity with which they\r\nseize their prey; for while some will only pounce on a bird while on\r\nthe ground, others will only seize it while hovering round the trees,\r\nothers, again, while it is perched aloft, and others while it is flying\r\nin mid air. Hence it is that pigeons, on seeing them, are aware of the\r\nnature of the danger to which they are exposed, and either settle on\r\nthe ground or else fly upwards, instinctively protecting themselves by\r\ntaking due precautions against their natural propensities. The hawks\r\nof the whole of Massæsylia, breed in Cerne,[2923] an island of Africa,\r\nlying in the ocean; and none of the kinds that are accustomed to those\r\nparts will breed anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—IN WHAT PLACES HAWKS AND MEN PURSUE THE CHASE IN COMPANY WITH\r\nEACH OTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the part of Thrace which lies above Amphipolis, men[2924] and hawks\r\ngo in pursuit of prey, in a sort of partnership as it were; for while\r\nthe men drive the birds from out of the woods and the reed-beds, the\r\nhawks bring them down as they fly; and after they have taken the game,\r\nthe fowlers share it with them. It has been said, that when sent aloft,\r\nthey will pick[2925] out the birds that are wanted, and that when the\r\nopportune moment for taking them has come, they invite the fowler\r\nto seize the opportunity by their cries and their peculiar mode of\r\nflying. The sea-wolves, too, in the Palus Mæotis, do something of a\r\nvery similar nature; but if they do not receive their fair share from\r\nthe fishermen, they will tear their nets as they lie extended.[2926]\r\nHawks will not[2927] eat the heart of a bird. The night-hawk is called\r\ncybindis;[2928] it is rarely found, even in the woods, and in the\r\nday-time its sight is not good; it wages war to the death with the\r\neagle, and they are often to be found clasped in each other’s talons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (9.)—THE ONLY BIRD THAT IS KILLED BY THOSE OF ITS OWN KIND.—A\r\nBIRD THAT LAYS ONLY ONE EGG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo seems to be but another form of the hawk,[2929] which at a\r\ncertain season of the year changes its shape; it being the fact that\r\nduring this period no other hawks are to be seen, except, perhaps,\r\nfor a few days only; the cuckoo, too, itself is only seen for a short\r\nperiod in the summer, and does not make its appearance after. It is the\r\nonly one among the hawks that has not hooked talons; neither is it like\r\nthe rest of them in the head, or, indeed, in any other respect, except\r\nthe colour only, while in the beak it bears a stronger resemblance\r\nto the pigeon. In addition to this, it is devoured by the hawk, if\r\nthey chance at any time to meet; this being the only one among the\r\nwhole race of birds that is preyed upon by those of its own kind. It\r\nchanges its voice also with its appearance, comes out in the spring,\r\nand goes into retirement at the rising of the Dog-star. It always lays\r\nits eggs in the nest of another bird, and that of the ring-dove[2930]\r\nmore especially,—mostly a single egg, a thing that is the case with no\r\nother bird; sometimes however, but very rarely, it is known to lay two.\r\nIt is supposed, that the reason for its thus substituting its young\r\nones, is the fact that it is aware[2931] how greatly it is hated by all\r\nthe other birds; for even the very smallest of them will attack it.\r\nHence it is, that it thinks its own race will stand no chance of being\r\nperpetuated unless it contrives to deceive them, and for this reason\r\nbuilds no nest of its own: and besides this, it is a very timid animal.\r\nIn the meantime, the female bird, sitting on her nest, is rearing a\r\nsupposititious and spurious progeny; while the young cuckoo, which is\r\nnaturally craving and greedy, snatches away all the food from the other\r\nyoung ones, and by so doing grows plump and sleek, and quite gains the\r\naffections of his foster-mother; who takes a great pleasure in his\r\nfine appearance, and is quite surprised that she has become the mother\r\nof so handsome an offspring. In comparison with him, she discards her\r\nown young as so many strangers, until at last, when the young cuckoo\r\nis now able to take the wing, he finishes by devouring[2932] her. For\r\nsweetness of the flesh, there is not a bird in existence to be compared\r\nto the cuckoo at this season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (10.)—THE KITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kite, which belongs to the same genus, is distinguished from the\r\nrest of the hawks by its larger size. It has been remarked of this\r\nbird, extremely ravenous as it is, and always craving, that it has\r\nnever been known to seize any food either from among funereal oblations\r\nor from the altar of Jupiter at Olympia; nor yet, in fact, does it ever\r\nseize any of the consecrated viands from the hands of those who are\r\ncarrying them; except where some misfortune is presaged for the town\r\nthat is offering the sacrifice. These birds seem to have taught man the\r\nart of steering, from the motion of the tail, Nature pointing out by\r\ntheir movements in the air the method required for navigating the deep.\r\nKites also disappear during the winter months, but do not take their\r\ndeparture before the swallow. It is said, also, that after the summer\r\nsolstice they are troubled with the gout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (11.)—THE CLASSIFICATION OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first distinctive characteristic among birds is that which bears\r\nreference more especially to their feet: they have either hooked\r\ntalons, or else toes, or else, again, they belong to the web-footed\r\nclass, geese for instance, and most of the aquatic birds. Those which\r\nhave hooked talons feed, for the most part, upon nothing but flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (12.)—CROWS. BIRDS OF ILL OMEN. AT WHAT SEASONS THEY ARE NOT\r\nINAUSPICIOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrows, again, have another kind of food. Nuts being too hard for their\r\nbeak to break, the crow flies to a great height, and then lets them\r\nfall again and again upon the stones or tiles beneath, until at last\r\nthe shell is cracked, after which the bird is able to open them. This\r\nis a bird with a very ill-omened garrulity, though it has been highly\r\npraised by some.[2933] It is observed, that from the rising of the\r\nconstellation Arcturus until the arrival of the swallow, it is but\r\nrarely to be seen about the sacred groves and temples of Minerva; in\r\nsome places, indeed, not at all, Athens for instance.[2934] In addition\r\nto these facts, it is the only one that continues to feed its young for\r\nsome time after they have begun to fly. The crow is most inauspicious\r\nat the time of incubation, or, in other words, just after the summer\r\nsolstice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—THE RAVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the other birds of the same kind drive their young ones from their\r\nnest, and compel them to fly; the raven, for instance, which not only\r\nfeeds on flesh, but even drives its young, when able to fly, to a still\r\ngreater distance. Hence it is that in small hamlets there are never\r\nmore than two[2935] pairs to be found; and in the neighbourhood of\r\nCrannon, in Thessaly, never more than one, the parents always quitting\r\nthe spot to give place to their offspring. There have been some\r\ndifferences observed between this and the bird last mentioned. Ravens\r\nbreed before the summer solstice, and continue in bad health for sixty\r\ndays—being afflicted with a continual thirst more particularly—before\r\nthe ripening of the fig in autumn; while, on the other hand, the crow\r\nis attacked by disease after that period. The raven lays, at most, but\r\nfive eggs. It is a vulgar belief, that they couple, or else lay, by\r\nmeans of the beak; and that, consequently, if a pregnant woman happens\r\nto eat a raven’s egg, she will be delivered by the mouth. It is also\r\nbelieved, that if the eggs are even so much as brought beneath the\r\nroof, a difficult labour will be the consequence. Aristotle denies\r\nit, and assures us in all good faith that there is no more truth in\r\nthis than in the same story about the ibis in Egypt; he says that it\r\nis nothing else but that same sort of billing that is so often seen\r\nin pigeons.[2936] Ravens are the only birds that seem to have any\r\ncomprehension of the meaning of their auspices; for when the guests\r\nof Medus[2937] were assassinated, they all took their departure from\r\nPeloponnesus and the region of Attica. They are of the very worst omen\r\nwhen they swallow their voice, as if they were being choked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—THE HORNED OWL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe birds of the night also have crooked talons, such as the\r\nowlet,[2938] the horned owl, and the screech-owl, for instance; the\r\nsight of all of which is defective in the day-time. The horned owl\r\nis especially funereal, and is greatly abhorred in all auspices of\r\na public nature: it inhabits deserted places, and not only desolate\r\nspots, but those of a frightful and inaccessible nature: the monster of\r\nthe night, its voice is heard, not with any tuneful note, but emitting\r\na sort of shriek. Hence it is that it is looked upon as a direful\r\nomen to see it in a city, or even so much as in the day-time. I know,\r\nhowever, for a fact, that it is not portentous of evil when it settles\r\non the top of a private house. It cannot fly whither it wishes in a\r\nstraight line, but is always carried along by a sidelong movement. A\r\nhorned owl entered the very sanctuary of the Capitol, in the consulship\r\nof Sextus Palpelius Hister and L. Pedanius; in consequence of which,\r\nRome was purified on the nones[2939] of March in that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (13.)—BIRDS, THE RACE OF WHICH IS EXTINCT, OR OF WHICH ALL\r\nKNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn inauspicious bird also is that known as the “incendiary;”[2940]\r\non account of which, we find in the Annals, the City has had to be\r\nrepeatedly purified; as, for instance, in the consulship of L. Cassius\r\nand C. Marius,[2941] in which year also it was purified, in consequence\r\nof a horned owl being seen. What kind of bird this incendiary bird\r\nwas, we do not find stated, nor is it known by tradition. Some persons\r\nexplain the term this way; they say that the name “incendiary”\r\nwas applied to every bird that was seen carrying a burning coal\r\nfrom the pyre, or altar; while others, again, call such a bird a\r\n“spinturnix”;[2942] though I never yet found any person who said that\r\nhe knew what kind of bird this spinturnix was.\r\n\r\n(14.) I find also that the people of our time are ignorant what bird it\r\nwas that was called by the ancients a “clivia.” Some persons say that\r\nit was a clamatory, others, again, that it was a prohibitory, bird. We\r\nalso find a bird mentioned by Nigidius as the “subis,” which breaks the\r\neggs of the eagle.\r\n\r\n(15.) In addition to the above, there are many other kinds that are\r\ndescribed in the Etruscan ritual, but which no one now living has ever\r\nseen. It is surprising that these birds are no longer in existence,\r\nsince we find that even those kinds abound, among which the gluttony of\r\nman commits such ravages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18. (16.)—BIRDS WHICH ARE BORN WITH THE TAIL FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong foreigners, a person called Hylas is thought to have written the\r\nbest treatise on the subject of augury. He informs us that the owlet,\r\nthe horned owl, the woodpecker, which makes holes in trees, the trygon,\r\nand the crow, are produced from the egg with the tail[2943] first; for\r\nthe egg, being turned upside down through the weight of the head of the\r\nchick, presents the wrong end to be warmed by the mother as she sits\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (17.)—THE OWLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe owlet shows considerable shrewdness in its engagements with other\r\nbirds; for when surrounded by too great a number, it throws itself on\r\nits back, and so, resisting with its feet, and rolling up its body\r\ninto a mass, defends itself with the beak and talons; until the hawk,\r\nattracted by a certain natural affinity, comes to its assistance, and\r\ntakes its share in the combat. Nigidius says, that the incubation of\r\nthe owlet lasts sixty days, during the winter, and that it has nine\r\ndifferent notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20. (18.)—THE WOOD-PECKER OF MARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some small birds also, which have hooked talons; the\r\nwood-pecker, for example, surnamed “of Mars,” of considerable\r\nimportance in the auspices. To this kind belong the birds which make\r\nholes in trees, and climb stealthily up them, like cats; mounting with\r\nthe head upwards, they tap against the bark, and learn by the sound\r\nwhether or not their food lies beneath; they are the only birds that\r\nhatch their young in the hollows of trees. It is a common belief,\r\nthat if a shepherd drives a wedge into their holes, they apply a\r\ncertain kind of herb,[2944] immediately upon which it falls out.\r\nTrebius informs us that if a nail or wedge is driven with ever so much\r\nforce into a tree in which these birds have made their nest, it will\r\ninstantly fly out, the tree making a loud cracking noise the moment\r\nthat the bird has lighted upon the nail or wedge.\r\n\r\nThese birds have held the first rank in auguries, in Latium, since\r\nthe time of the king[2945] who has given them their name. One of the\r\npresages that was given by them, I cannot pass over in silence. A\r\nwoodpecker came and lighted upon the head of Ælius Tubero, the City\r\nprætor, when sitting on his tribunal dispensing justice in the Forum,\r\nand showed such tameness as to allow itself to be taken with the hand;\r\nupon which the augurs declared that if it was let go, the state was\r\nmenaced with danger, but if killed, disaster would befall the prætor;\r\nin an instant he tore the bird to pieces, and before long the omen was\r\nfulfilled.[2946]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (19.)—BIRDS WHICH HAVE HOOKED TALONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany birds of this kind feed also on acorns and fruit, but only those\r\nwhich are not carnivorous, with the exception of the kite; though when\r\nit feeds on anything but flesh, it is a bird of ill omen.\r\n\r\nThe birds which have hooked talons are never gregarious; each one seeks\r\nits prey by itself. They nearly all of them soar to a great height,\r\nwith the exception of the birds of the night, and more especially those\r\nof larger size. They all have large wings, and a small body; they walk\r\nwith difficulty, and rarely settle upon stones, being prevented from\r\ndoing so by the curved shape of their talons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (20.)—THE PEACOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now speak of the second class of birds, which is divided into\r\ntwo kinds; those which give omens[2947] by their note, and those which\r\nafford presages by their flight. The variation of the note in the one,\r\nand the relative size in the other, constitute the differences between\r\nthem. These last, therefore, shall be treated of first, and the peacock\r\nshall have precedence of all the rest, as much for its singular beauty\r\nas its superior instinct, and the vanity it displays.\r\n\r\nWhen it hears itself praised, this bird spreads out its gorgeous\r\ncolours, and especially if the sun happens to be shining at the time,\r\nbecause then they are seen in all their radiance, and to better\r\nadvantage. At the same time, spreading out its tail in the form of a\r\nshell, it throws the reflection upon the other feathers, which shine\r\nall the more brilliantly when a shadow is cast upon them; then at\r\nanother moment it will contract all the eyes[2948] depicted upon its\r\nfeathers in a single mass, manifesting great delight in having them\r\nadmired by the spectator. The peacock loses its tail every year at the\r\nfall of the leaf, and a new one shoots forth in its place at the flower\r\nseason; between these periods the bird is abashed and moping, and seeks\r\nretired spots. The peacock lives twenty-five years, and begins to show\r\nits colours in the third. By some authors it is stated that this bird\r\nis not only a vain creature, but of a spiteful disposition also, just\r\nin the same way that they attribute bashfulness to the goose.[2949] The\r\ncharacteristics, however, which they have thus ascribed to these birds,\r\nappear to me to be utterly unfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—WHO WAS THE FIRST TO KILL THE PEACOCK FOR FOOD.—WHO FIRST\r\nTAUGHT THE ART OF CRAMMING THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orator Hortensius was the first Roman who had the peacock killed\r\nfor table; it was on the occasion of the banquet given by him on his\r\ninauguration in the college of the priesthood. M. Aufidius Lurco[2950]\r\nwas the first who taught the art of fattening them, about the time of\r\nthe last war with the Pirates. From this source of profit he acquired\r\nan income of sixty thousand sesterces.[2951]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (21.)—THE DUNGHILL COCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext after the peacock, the animal that acts as our watchman by night,\r\nand which Nature has produced for the purpose of arousing mortals\r\nto their labours, and dispelling their slumbers, shows itself most\r\nactuated by feelings of vanity. The cock knows how to distinguish the\r\nstars, and marks the different periods of the day, every three hours,\r\nby his note. These animals go to roost with the setting of the sun, and\r\nat the fourth watch of the camp recall man to his cares and toils. They\r\ndo not allow the rising of the sun to creep upon us unawares, but by\r\ntheir note proclaim the coming day, and they prelude their crowing by\r\nclapping their sides with their wings. They exercise a rigorous sway\r\nover the other birds of their kind, and, in every place where they are\r\nkept, hold the supreme command. This, however, is only obtained after\r\nrepeated battles among themselves, as they are well aware that they\r\nhave weapons on their legs, produced for that very purpose, as it were,\r\nand the contest often ends in the death of both the combatants at the\r\nsame moment. If, on the other hand, one of them obtains the mastery, he\r\ninstantly by his note proclaims himself the conqueror, and testifies by\r\nhis crowing that he has been victorious; while his conquered opponent\r\nsilently slinks away, and, though with a very bad grace, submits to\r\nservitude. And with equal pride does the throng of the poultry yard\r\nstrut along, with head uplifted and crest erect. These, too, are the\r\nonly ones among the winged race that repeatedly look up to the heavens,\r\nwith the tail, which in its drooping shape resembles that of a sickle,\r\nraised aloft: and so it is that these birds inspire terror even in the\r\nlion,[2952] the most courageous of all animals.\r\n\r\nSome of these birds, too, are reared for nothing but warfare and\r\nperpetual combats, and have even shed a lustre thereby on their native\r\nplaces, Rhodes and Tanagra. The next rank is considered to belong\r\nto those of Melos[2953] and Chalcis. Hence, it is not without very\r\ngood reason that the consular purple of Rome pays these birds such\r\nsingular honours. It is from the feeding of these creatures that the\r\nomens[2954] by fowls are derived; it is these that regulate[2955] day\r\nby day the movements of our magistrates, and open or shut to them their\r\nown houses, as the case may be; it is these that give an impulse to\r\nthe fasces of the Roman magistracy, or withhold them; it is these that\r\ncommand battles or forbid them, and furnish auspices for victories to\r\nbe gained in every part of the world. It is these that hold supreme\r\nrule over those who are themselves the rulers of the earth, and whose\r\nentrails and fibres are as pleasing to the gods as the first spoils of\r\nvictory. Their note, when heard at an unusual hour or in the evening,\r\nhas also its peculiar presages; for, on one occasion, by crowing the\r\nwhole night through for several nights, they presaged to the Bœotians\r\nthat famous victory[2956] which they gained over the Lacedæmonians;\r\nsuch, in fact, being the interpretation that was put upon it by way of\r\nprognostic, as this bird, when conquered, is never known to crow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—HOW COCKS ARE CASTRATED. A COCK THAT ONCE SPOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen castrated, cocks cease to crow. This operation is performed two\r\ndifferent ways. Either the loins of the animal are seared with a\r\nred-hot iron, or else the lower part of the legs; after which, the\r\nwound is covered up with potter’s clay: this way they are fattened\r\nmuch more easily. At Pergamus,[2957] there is every year a public show\r\nof fights of game-cocks, just as in other places we have those of\r\ngladiators.\r\n\r\nWe find it stated in the Roman Annals, that in the[2958] consulship of\r\nM. Lepidus and Q. Catulus a dung-hill cock spoke, at the farm-house of\r\nGalerius; the only occasion, in fact, that I know of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26. (22.)—THE GOOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goose also keeps a vigilant guard; a fact which is well attested\r\nby the defence of the Capitol, at a moment when, by the silence of\r\nthe dogs, the commonwealth had been betrayed:[2959] for which reason\r\nit is that the Censors always, the first thing of all, attend to the\r\nfarming-out of the feeding of the sacred geese. What is still more,\r\ntoo, there is a love-story about this animal. At Ægium one is said to\r\nhave conceived a passion for a beautiful boy, a native of Olenos,[2960]\r\nand another for Glauce, a damsel who was lute-player to King Ptolemy;\r\nfor whom at the same time a ram is said also to have conceived a\r\npassion. One might almost be tempted to think that these creatures have\r\nan appreciation of wisdom:[2961] for it is said, that one of them was\r\nthe constant companion of the philosopher, Lacydes, and would never\r\nleave him, either in public or when at the bath, by night or by day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—WHO FIRST TAUGHT US TO USE THE LIVER OF THE GOOSE FOR FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur people, however, are more wise; for they only esteem the goose for\r\nthe goodness of its liver.[2962] When they are crammed, this grows to\r\na very large size, and on being taken from the animal, is made still\r\nlarger by being soaked in honeyed milk.[2963] And, indeed, it is\r\nnot without good reason that it is matter of debate who it was that\r\nfirst discovered so great a delicacy; whether, in fact, it was Scipio\r\nMetellus, a man of consular dignity, or M. Seius, a contemporary of\r\nhis, and a Roman of equestrian rank. However, a thing about which there\r\nis no dispute, it was Messalinus Cotta, the son of the orator Messala,\r\nwho first discovered the art of roasting the webbed feet of the\r\ngoose, and of cooking them in a ragout with cocks’ combs: for I shall\r\nfaithfully award each culinary palm to such as I shall find deserving\r\nof it. It is a wonderful fact, in relation to this bird, that it comes\r\non foot all the way from the country of the Morini[2964] to Rome; those\r\nthat are tired are placed in the front rank, while the rest, taught by\r\na natural instinct to move in a compact body, drive them on.\r\n\r\nA second income, too, is also to be derived from the feathers of the\r\nwhite goose. In some places, this animal is plucked twice a year, upon\r\nwhich the feathers quickly grow again. Those are the softest which lie\r\nnearest to the body, and those that come from Germany are the most\r\nesteemed: the geese there are white, but of small size, and are called\r\ngantæ.[2965] The price paid for their feathers is five denarii per\r\npound. It is from this fruitful source that we have repeated charges\r\nbrought against the commanders of our auxiliaries, who are in the habit\r\nof detaching whole cohorts from the posts where they ought to be on\r\nguard, in pursuit of these birds: indeed, we have come to such a pitch\r\nof effeminacy, that now-a-days, not even the men can think of lying\r\ndown without the aid of the goose’s feathers, by way of pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—OF THE COMMAGENIAN MEDICAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe part of Syria which is called Commagene, has discovered another\r\ninvention also; the fat of the goose[2966] is enclosed with some\r\ncinnamon in a brazen vessel, and then covered with a thick layer of\r\nsnow. Under the influence of the excessive cold, it becomes macerated,\r\nand fit for use as a medicament, remarkable for its properties: from\r\nthe country which produces it, it is known to us as “Commagenum.”[2967]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—THE CHENALOPEX, THE CHENEROS, THE TETRAO, AND THE OTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the goose genus belong also the chenalopex,[2968] and the\r\ncheneros,[2969] a little smaller than the common goose, and which forms\r\nthe most exquisite of all the dainties that Britannia provides for the\r\ntable. The tetrao[2970] is remarkable for the lustre of its plumage,\r\nand its extreme darkness, while the eyelids are of a scarlet colour.\r\nAnother species[2971] of this last bird exceeds the vulture in size,\r\nand is of a similar colour to it; and, indeed, there is no bird, with\r\nthe exception of the ostrich, the body of which is of a greater weight;\r\nfor to such a size does it grow, that it becomes incapable of moving,\r\nand allows itself to be taken on the ground. The Alps and the regions\r\nof the North produce these birds; but when kept in aviaries, they lose\r\ntheir fine flavour, and by retaining their breath, will die of mere\r\nvexation. Next to these in size are the birds which in Spain they call\r\nthe “tarda,”[2972] and in Greece the “otis;” they are looked upon\r\nhowever as very inferior food; the marrow,[2973] when disengaged from\r\nthe bones, immediately emits a most noisome smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (23.)—CRANES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the departure of the cranes, which, as we have already stated,[2974]\r\nwere in the habit of waging war with them, the nation of the Pygmies\r\nnow enjoys a respite. The tracts over which they travel must be\r\nimmense, if we only consider that they come all the way from the\r\nEastern Sea.[2975] These birds agree by common consent at what moment\r\nthey shall set out, fly aloft to look out afar, select a leader for\r\nthem to follow, and have sentinels duly posted in the rear, which\r\nrelieve each other by turns, utter loud cries, and with their voice\r\nkeep the whole flight in proper array. During the night, also, they\r\nplace sentinels on guard, each of which holds a little stone in its\r\nclaw: if the bird should happen to fall asleep, the claw becomes\r\nrelaxed, and the stone falls to the ground, and so convicts it of\r\nneglect. The rest sleep in the meanwhile, with the head beneath the\r\nwing, standing first on one leg and then on the other: the leader looks\r\nout, with neck erect, and gives warning when required. These birds,\r\nwhen tamed, are very frolicsome, and even when alone will describe a\r\nsort of circle, as they move along, with their clumsy gait.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, that these birds, when about to fly over the\r\nEuxine, first of all repair to the narrowest part of it, that lies\r\nbetween the two[2976] Promontories of Criumetopon and Carambis, and\r\nthen ballast themselves with coarse sand. When they have arrived midway\r\nin the passage, they throw away the stones from out of their claws,\r\nand, as soon as they reach the mainland, discharge the sand by the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nCornelius Nepos, who died in the reign of the late Emperor Augustus,\r\nafter stating that thrushes had been fattened for the first time\r\nshortly before that period, has added that storks were more esteemed as\r\nfood than cranes: whereas at the present day, this last bird is one of\r\nthose that are held in the very highest esteem, while no one will so\r\nmuch as touch the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—STORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the present time it has not been ascertained from what place the\r\nstorks come, or whither they go when they leave us. There can be no\r\ndoubt but that, like the cranes, they come from a very great distance,\r\nthe cranes being our winter, the storks our summer, guests. When about\r\nto take their departure, the storks assemble at a stated place, and\r\nare particularly careful that all shall attend, so that not one of\r\ntheir kind may be left behind, with the exception of such as may be in\r\ncaptivity or tamed; and then on a certain day they set out, as though\r\nby some law they were directed to do so. No one has ever yet seen a\r\nflight of cranes taking their departure, although they have been often\r\nobserved preparing to depart; and in the same way, too, we never see\r\nthem arrive, but only when they have arrived; both their departure as\r\nwell as their arrival take place in the night. Although, too, we see\r\nthem flying about in all directions, it is still supposed that they\r\nnever arrive at any other time but in the night. Pythonoscome[2977] is\r\nthe name given to some vast plains of Asia, where, as they assemble\r\ntogether, they keep up a gabbling noise, and tear to pieces the one\r\nthat happens to arrive the last; after which they take their departure.\r\nIt has been remarked that after the ides of August,[2978] they are\r\nnever by any accident to be seen there.\r\n\r\nThere are some writers who assure us that the stork has no tongue. So\r\nhighly are they esteemed for their utility in destroying serpents, that\r\nin Thessaly, it was a capital crime for any one to kill a stork, and by\r\nthe laws the same penalty was inflicted for it as for homicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—SWANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeese, and swans also, travel in a similar manner, but then they are\r\nseen to take their flight. The flocks, forming a point, move along\r\nwith great impetus, much, indeed, after the manner of our Liburnian\r\nbeaked galleys; and it is by doing so that they are enabled to cleave\r\nthe air more easily than if they presented to it a broad front. The\r\nflight gradually enlarges in the rear, much in the form of a wedge,\r\npresenting a vast surface to the breeze, as it impels them onward;\r\nthose that follow place their necks on those that go before, while the\r\nleading birds, as they become weary, fall to the rear. Storks return\r\nto their former nests, and the young, in their turn, support their\r\nparents when old. It is stated that at the moment of the swan’s death,\r\nit gives utterance to a mournful song;[2979] but this is an error, in\r\nmy opinion, at least I have tested the truth of the story on several\r\noccasions. These birds will eat the flesh of one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH VISIT US; THE QUAIL, THE GLOTTIS, THE\r\nCYCHRAMUS, AND THE OTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of the emigration of these birds over sea and land, I\r\ncannot allow myself to defer mentioning some other birds of smaller\r\nsize, which have the same natural instinct: although in the case of\r\nthose which I have already mentioned, their very size and strength\r\nwould almost seem to invite them to such habits. The quail, which\r\nalways arrives among us even before the crane, is a small bird, and\r\nwhen it has once arrived, more generally keeps to the ground than\r\nflies aloft. These birds fly also in a similar manner to those I have\r\nalready spoken of, and not without considerable danger to mariners,\r\nwhen they come near the surface of the earth: for it often happens\r\nthat they settle on the sails of a ship, and that too always in the\r\nnight: the consequence of which is, that the vessel often sinks.\r\nThese birds pursue their course along a tract of country with certain\r\nresting-places. When the south wind is blowing, they will not fly, as\r\nthat wind is always humid, and apt to weigh them down. Still, however,\r\nit is an object with them to get a breeze to assist them in their\r\nflight, the body being so light, and their strength so very limited:\r\nhence it is that we hear them make that murmuring noise as they fly, it\r\nbeing extorted from them by fatigue. It is for this reason also, that\r\nthey take to flight more especially when the north wind is blowing,\r\nhaving the ortygometra[2980] for their leader. The first of them that\r\napproaches the earth is generally snapped up by the hawk. When they are\r\nabout to return from these parts, they always invite other birds to\r\njoin their company, and the glottis, otus, and cychramus, yielding to\r\ntheir persuasions, take their departure along with them.\r\n\r\nThe glottis[2981] protrudes a tongue of remarkable length, from which\r\ncircumstance it derives its name: at first it is quite pleased with the\r\njourney, and sets out with the greatest ardour; very soon, however,\r\nwhen it begins to feel the fatigues of the flight, it is overtaken by\r\nregret, while at the same time it is equally as loth to return alone,\r\nas to accompany the others. Its travels, however, never last more than\r\na single day, for at the very first resting-place they come to, it\r\ndeserts: here too it finds other birds, which have been left behind\r\nin a similar manner in the preceding year. The same takes place with\r\nother birds day after day. The cychramus,[2982] however, is much more\r\npersevering, and is quite in a hurry to arrive at the land which is its\r\ndestination: hence it is that it arouses the quails in the night, and\r\nreminds them that they ought to be on the road.\r\n\r\nThe otus is a smaller bird than the horned owl, though larger than the\r\nowlet; it has feathers projecting like ears, whence its name. Some\r\npersons call it in the Latin language the “asio;”[2983] in general it\r\nis a bird fond of mimicking, a great parasite, and, in some measure,\r\na dancer as well. Like the owlet, it is taken without any difficulty;\r\nfor while one person occupies its attention, another goes behind, and\r\ncatches it.\r\n\r\nIf the wind, by its contrary blasts, should begin to prevent the onward\r\nprogress of the flight, the birds immediately take up small stones,\r\nor else fill their throats with sand, and so contrive to ballast\r\nthemselves as they fly. The seeds of a certain venomous plant[2984] are\r\nmost highly esteemed by the quails as food; for which reason it is\r\nthat they have been banished from our tables; in addition to which, a\r\ngreat repugnance is manifested to eating their flesh, on account of the\r\nepilepsy,[2985] to which alone of all animals, with the exception of\r\nman, the quail is subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (24.)—SWALLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe swallow, the only bird that is carnivorous among those which have\r\nnot hooked talons, takes its departure also during the winter months;\r\nbut it only goes to neighbouring countries, seeking sunny retreats\r\nthere on the mountain sides; sometimes they have been found in such\r\nspots bare and quite unfledged. This bird, it is said, will not enter\r\na house in Thebes, because that city has been captured so frequently;\r\nnor will it approach the country of the Bizyæ, on account of the crimes\r\ncommitted there by Tereus.[2986] Cæcina[2987] of Volaterræ, a member of\r\nthe equestrian order, and the owner of several chariots, used to have\r\nswallows caught, and then carried them with him to Rome. Upon gaining\r\na victory, he would send the news by them to his friends; for after\r\nstaining them the colour[2988] of the party that had gained the day,\r\nhe would let them go, immediately upon which they would make their way\r\nto the nests they had previously occupied. Fabius Pictor also relates,\r\nin his Annals, that when a Roman garrison was being besieged by the\r\nLigurians, a swallow which had been taken from its young ones was\r\nbrought to him, in order that he might give them notice, by the number\r\nof knots on a string tied to its leg, on what day succour would arrive,\r\nand a sortie might be made with advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—BIRDS WHICH TAKE THEIR DEPARTURE FROM US, AND WHITHER THEY\r\nGO; THE THRUSH, THE BLACKBIRD, AND THE STARLING—BIRDS WHICH LOSE THEIR\r\nFEATHERS DURING THEIR RETIREMENT—THE TURTLE-DOVE AND THE RING-DOVE—THE\r\nFLIGHT OF STARLINGS AND SWALLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner also, the blackbird, the thrush, and the starling\r\ntake their departure to neighbouring countries; but they do not lose\r\ntheir feathers, nor yet conceal themselves, as they are often to be\r\nseen in places where they seek their food during the winter: hence\r\nit is that in winter, more especially, the thrush is so often to be\r\nseen in Germany. It is, however, a well-ascertained fact, that the\r\nturtle-dove conceals itself, and loses its feathers. The ring-dove,\r\nalso, takes its departure: and with these too, it is a matter of doubt\r\nwhither they go. It is a peculiarity of the starling to fly in troops,\r\nas it were, and then to wheel round in a globular mass like a ball, the\r\ncentral troop acting as a pivot for the rest. Swallows are the only\r\nbirds that have a sinuous flight of remarkable velocity; for which\r\nreason it is that they are not exposed to the attacks of other birds\r\nof prey: these too, in fine, are the only birds that take their food\r\nsolely on the wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (25.)—BIRDS WHICH REMAIN WITH US THROUGHOUT THE YEAR; BIRDS\r\nWHICH REMAIN WITH US ONLY SIX OR THREE MONTHS; WITWALLS AND HOOPOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time during which birds show themselves differs very considerably.\r\nSome remain with us all the year round, the pigeon, for instance;\r\nsome for six months, such as the swallow; and some, again, for three\r\nmonths only, as the thrush, the turtle-dove, and those which take their\r\ndeparture the moment they have reared their young, the witwall[2989]\r\nand the hoopoe, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (26.)—THE MEMNONIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some authors who say that every year certain birds[2990]\r\nfly from Æthiopia to Ilium, and have a combat at the tomb of Memnon\r\nthere; from which circumstance they have received from them the name\r\nof Memnonides, or birds of Memnon. Cremutius states it also as a fact,\r\nascertained by himself, that they do the same every fifth year in\r\nÆthiopia, around the palace of Memnon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—THE MELEAGRIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner also, the birds called meleagrides[2991] fight in\r\nBœotia. They are a species of African poultry, having a hump on the\r\nback, which is covered with a mottled plumage. These are the latest\r\namong the foreign birds that have been received at our tables, on\r\naccount of their disagreeable smell. The tomb, however, of Meleager has\r\nrendered them famous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (27.)—THE SELEUCIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose birds are called seleucides, which are sent by Jupiter at the\r\nprayers offered up to him by the inhabitants of Mount Casius,[2992]\r\nwhen the locusts are ravaging their crops of corn. Whence they[2993]\r\ncome, or whither they go, has never yet been ascertained, as, in fact,\r\nthey are never to be seen but when the people stand in need of their\r\naid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40. (28.)—THE IBIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians also invoke their ibis against the incursions of\r\nserpents; and the people of Elis, their god Myiagros,[2994] when the\r\nvast multitudes of flies are bringing pestilence among them; the flies\r\ndie immediately the propitiatory sacrifice has been made to this god.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (29.)—PLACES IN WHICH CERTAIN BIRDS ARE NEVER FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to the departure of birds, the owlet, too, is said to\r\nlie concealed for a few days. No birds of this last kind are to be\r\nfound in the island of Crete, and if any are imported thither, they\r\nimmediately die. Indeed, this is a remarkable distinction made by\r\nNature; for she denies to certain places, as it were, certain kinds of\r\nfruits and shrubs, and of animals as well; it is singular that when\r\nintroduced into these localities they will be no longer productive, but\r\ndie immediately they are thus transplanted. What can it be that is thus\r\nfatal to the increase of one particular species, or whence this envy\r\nmanifested against them by Nature? What, too, are the limits that have\r\nbeen marked out for the birds on the face of the earth?\r\n\r\nRhodes[2995] possesses no eagles. In Italy beyond the Padus there is,\r\nnear the Alps, a lake known by the name of Larius beautifully situate\r\namid a country covered with shrubs; and yet this lake is never visited\r\nby storks, nor, indeed, are they ever known to come within eight miles\r\nof it; while, on the other hand, in the neighbouring territory of the\r\nInsubres[2996] there are immense flocks of magpies and jackdaws, the\r\nonly[2997] bird that is guilty of stealing gold and silver, a very\r\nsingular propensity.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in the territory of Tarentum, the woodpecker of Mars\r\nis never found. It is only lately too, and that but very rarely, that\r\nvarious kinds of pies have begun to be seen in the districts that lie\r\nbetween the Apennines and the City; birds which are known by the name\r\nof “variæ,”[2998] and are remarkable for the length of the tail. It\r\nis a peculiarity of this bird, that it becomes bald every year at the\r\ntime of sowing rape. The partridge does not fly beyond the frontiers\r\nof Bœotia, into Attica; nor does any bird, in the island[2999] in the\r\nEuxine in which Achilles was buried, enter the temple there consecrated\r\nto him. In the territory of Fidenæ, in the vicinity of the City,\r\nthe storks have no young nor do they build nests: but vast numbers\r\nof ringdoves arrive from beyond sea every year in the district of\r\nVolaterræ. At Rome, neither flies nor dogs ever enter the temple of\r\nHercules in the Cattle Market. There are numerous other instances of a\r\nsimilar nature in reference to all kinds of animals, which from time\r\nto time I feel myself prompted by prudent considerations to omit, lest\r\nI should only weary the reader. Theophrastus, for example, relates\r\nthat even pigeons, as well as peacocks and ravens, have been introduced\r\nfrom other parts into Asia,[3000] as also croaking frogs[3001] into\r\nCyrenaica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF BIRDS WHICH AFFORD OMENS BY THEIR\r\nNOTE—BIRDS WHICH CHANGE THEIR COLOUR AND THEIR VOICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another remarkable fact too, relative to the birds which give\r\nomens by their note; they generally change their colour and voice at\r\na certain season of the year, and suddenly become quite altered in\r\nappearance; a thing that, among the larger birds, happens with the\r\ncrane only, which grows black in its old age. From black, the blackbird\r\nchanges to a reddish colour, sings in summer, chatters in winter, and\r\nabout the summer solstice loses its voice; when a year old, the beak\r\nalso assumes the appearance of ivory; this, however, is the case only\r\nwith the male. In the summer, the thrush is mottled about the neck, but\r\nin the winter it becomes of one uniform colour all over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—THE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song of the nightingale is to be heard, without intermission,\r\nfor fifteen days and nights, continuously,[3002] when the foliage\r\nis thickening, as it bursts from the bud; a bird which deserves our\r\nadmiration in no slight degree. First of all, what a powerful voice in\r\nso small a body! its note, how long, and how well sustained! And then,\r\ntoo, it is the only bird the notes of which are modulated in accordance\r\nwith the strict rules of musical science.[3003] At one moment, as it\r\nsustains its breath, it will prolong its note, and then at another,\r\nwill vary it with different inflexions; then, again, it will break into\r\ndistinct chirrups, or pour forth an endless series of roulades. Then\r\nit will warble to itself, while taking breath, or else disguise its\r\nvoice in an instant; while sometimes, again, it will twitter to itself,\r\nnow with a full note, now with a grave, now again sharp, now with a\r\nbroken note, and now with a prolonged one. Sometimes, again, when it\r\nthinks fit, it will break out into quavers, and will run through, in\r\nsuccession, alto, tenor, and bass: in a word, in so tiny a throat is to\r\nbe found all the melody that the ingenuity of man has ever discovered\r\nthrough the medium of the invention of the most exquisite flute: so\r\nmuch so, that there can be no doubt it was an infallible presage of his\r\nfuture sweetness as a poet, when one of these creatures perched and\r\nsang on the infant lips of the poet Stesichorus.\r\n\r\nThat there may remain no doubt that there is a certain degree of art\r\nin its performances, we may here remark that every bird has a number\r\nof notes peculiar to itself; for they do not, all of them, have the\r\nsame, but each, certain melodies of its own. They vie with one another,\r\nand the spirit with which they contend is evident to all. The one that\r\nis vanquished, often dies in the contest, and will rather yield its\r\nlife than its song. The younger birds are listening in the meantime,\r\nand receive the lesson in song from which they are to profit. The\r\nlearner hearkens with the greatest attention, and repeats what it\r\nhas heard, and then they are silent by turns; this is understood to\r\nbe the correction of an error on the part of the scholar, and a sort\r\nof reproof, as it were, on the part of the teacher. Hence it is that\r\nnightingales fetch as high a price as slaves, and, indeed, sometimes\r\nmore than used formerly to be paid for a man in a suit of armour.\r\n\r\nI know that on one occasion six thousand sesterces[3004] were paid for\r\na nightingale, a white one it is true, a thing that is hardly ever to\r\nbe seen, to be made a present of to Agrippina, the wife of the Emperor\r\nClaudius. A nightingale has been often seen that will sing at command,\r\nand take alternate parts with the music that accompanies it; men, too,\r\nhave been found who could imitate its note with such exactness, that\r\nit would be impossible to tell the difference, by merely putting water\r\nin a reed held crosswise, and then blowing into it, a languette being\r\nfirst inserted, for the purpose of breaking the sound and rendering it\r\nmore shrill.[3005] But these modulations, so clever and so artistic,\r\nbegin gradually to cease at the end of the fifteen days; not that you\r\ncan say, however, that the bird is either fatigued or tired of singing;\r\nbut, as the heat increases, its voice becomes altogether changed, and\r\npossesses no longer either modulation or variety of note. Its colour,\r\ntoo, becomes changed, and at last, throughout the winter, it totally\r\ndisappears. The tongue of the nightingale is not pointed at the tip, as\r\nin other birds. It lays at the beginning of the spring, six eggs at the\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—THE MELANCORYPHUS, THE ERITHACUS, AND THE PHŒNICURUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe change is different that takes place in the ficedula,[3006] for\r\nthis bird changes its shape as well as its colour. “Ficedula” is the\r\nname by which it is called in autumn, but not after that period; for\r\nthen it is called “melancoryphus.”[3007] In the same manner, too, the\r\nerithacus[3008] of the winter is the “phœnicurus” of the summer. The\r\nhoopoe also, according to the poet Æschylus, changes its form; it is a\r\nbird that feeds upon filth[3009] of all kinds, and is remarkable for\r\nits twisted top-knot, which it can contract or elevate at pleasure\r\nalong the top of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—THE ŒNANTHE, THE CHLORION, THE BLACKBIRD, AND THE IBIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe œnanthe,[3010] too, is a bird that has stated days for its\r\nretreat. At the rising of Sirius it conceals itself, and at the\r\nsetting of that star comes forth from its retreat: and this it does, a\r\nmost singular thing, exactly upon both those days. The chlorion,[3011]\r\nalso, the body of which is yellow all over, is not seen in the winter,\r\nbut comes out about the summer solstice.\r\n\r\n(30.) The blackbird is found in the vicinity of Cyllene, in Arcadia,\r\nwith white[3012] plumage; a thing that is the case nowhere else. The\r\nibis, in the neighbourhood of Pelusium[3013] only is black, while in\r\nall other places it is white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46. (31.)—THE TIMES OF INCUBATION OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe birds that have a note, with the exception of those previously\r\nmentioned,[3014] do not by any chance produce their young before the\r\nvernal or after the autumnal equinox. As to the broods produced before\r\nthe summer solstice, it is very doubtful if they will survive, but\r\nthose hatched after it thrive well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47. (32.)—THE HALCYONES: THE HALCYON DAYS THAT ARE FAVOURABLE TO\r\nNAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is for this that the halcyon[3015] is more especially remarkable;\r\nthe seas, and all those who sail upon their surface, well know the\r\ndays of its incubation. This bird is a little larger than a sparrow,\r\nand the greater part of its body is of an azure blue colour, with only\r\nan intermixture of white and purple in some of the larger feathers,\r\nwhile the neck[3016] is long and slender. There is one kind that is\r\nremarkable for its larger size and its note; the smaller ones are\r\nheard singing in the reed-beds. It is a thing of very rare occurrence\r\nto see a halcyon, and then it is only about the time of the setting\r\nof the Vergiliæ, and the summer and winter solstices; when one is\r\nsometimes to be seen to hover about a ship, and then immediately\r\ndisappear. They hatch their young at the time of the winter solstice,\r\nfrom which circumstance those days are known as the “halcyon days:”\r\nduring this period the sea is calm and navigable, the Sicilian sea\r\nin particular. They make their nest during the seven days before\r\nthe winter solstice, and sit the same number of days after. Their\r\nnests[3017] are truly wonderful; they are of the shape of a ball\r\nslightly elongated, have a very narrow mouth, and bear a strong\r\nresemblance to a large sponge. It is impossible to cut them asunder\r\nwith iron, and they are only to be broken with a strong blow, upon\r\nwhich they separate, just like foam of the sea when dried up. It has\r\nnever yet been discovered of what material they are made; some persons\r\nthink that they are formed of sharp fish-bones, as it is on fish that\r\nthese birds live. They enter rivers also; their eggs are five in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—OTHER KINDS OF AQUATIC BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea-mew also builds its nest in rocks, and the diver[3018] in trees\r\nas well. These birds produce three at the very most; the sea-mew in\r\nsummer, the diver at the beginning of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49. (33.)—THE INSTINCTIVE CLEVERNESS DISPLAYED BY BIRDS IN THE\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF THEIR NESTS. THE WONDERFUL WORKS OF THE SWALLOW. THE\r\nBANK-SWALLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form of the nest built by the halcyon reminds me also of the\r\ninstinctive cleverness displayed by other birds; and, indeed, in no\r\nrespect is the ingenuity of birds more deserving of our admiration. The\r\nswallow builds its nest of mud, and strengthens it with straws. If mud\r\nhappens to fail, it soaks itself with a quantity of water, which it\r\nthen shakes from off its feathers into the dust. It lines the inside\r\nof the nest with soft feathers and wool, to keep the eggs warm, and\r\nin order that the nest may not be hard and rough to its young when\r\nhatched. It divides the food among its offspring with the most rigid\r\njustice, giving it first to one and then to another. With a remarkable\r\nnotion of cleanliness, it throws out of the nest the ordure of the\r\nyoung ones, and when they have grown a little older, teaches them how\r\nto turn round, and let it fall outside of the nest.\r\n\r\nThere is another[3019] kind of swallow, also, that frequents the\r\nfields and the country; its nest is of a different shape, though of\r\nthe same materials, but it rarely builds it against houses. The nest\r\nhas its mouth turned straight upwards, and the entrance to it is long\r\nand narrow, while the body is very capacious. It is quite wonderful\r\nwhat skill is displayed in the formation of it, for the purpose of\r\nconcealing the young ones, and of presenting a soft surface for them to\r\nlie upon. At the Heracleotic Mouth of the Nile in Egypt, the swallows\r\npresent an insuperable obstacle to the inroads of that river, in the\r\nembankment which is formed by their nests in one continuous line,\r\nnearly a stadium in length; a thing that could not possibly have been\r\neffected by the agency of man. In Egypt, too, near the city of Coptos,\r\nthere is an island sacred to Isis. In the early days of spring, the\r\nswallows strengthen the angular corner of this island with chaff and\r\nstraw, thus fortifying it in order that the river may not sweep it\r\naway. This work they persevere in for three days and nights together,\r\nwith such unremitting labour, that it is a well-known fact that many\r\nof them die with their exertions. This, too, is a toil which recurs\r\nregularly for them every year.\r\n\r\nThere is, again, a third kind[3020] of swallow, which makes holes in\r\nthe banks of rivers, to serve for its nest. The young of these birds,\r\nreduced to ashes, are a good specific against mortal maladies of the\r\nthroat, and tend to cure many other diseases of the human body. These\r\nbirds do not build nests, and they take care to migrate a good many\r\ndays before, if it so happens that the rise of the river is about to\r\nreach their holes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—THE ACANTHYLLIS AND OTHER BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelonging to the genus of birds known as the “vitiparræ,” there is\r\none[3021] whose nest is formed of dried moss,[3022] and is in shape so\r\nexactly like a ball, that it is impossible to discover the mouth of it.\r\nThe bird, also, that is known as the acanthyllis,[3023] makes its nest\r\nof a similar shape, and interweaves it with pieces of flax. The nest of\r\none of the woodpeckers, very much like a cup in shape, is suspended by\r\na twig from the end of the branch of a tree, so that no quadruped may\r\nbe able to reach it. It is strongly asserted, that the witwall[3024]\r\nsleeps suspended by its feet, because it fancies that by doing so it\r\nis in greater safety. A thing, indeed, that is well-known of them all,\r\nis the fact that, in a spirit of foresight, they select the projecting\r\nbranches of trees that are sufficiently strong, for the purpose of\r\nsupporting their nests, and then arch them over to protect them from\r\nthe rain, or else shield them by means of the thickness of the foliage.\r\n\r\nIn Arabia there is a bird known as the “cinnamolgus.”[3025] It builds\r\nits nest with sprigs of cinnamon; and the natives knock them down with\r\narrows loaded with lead, in order to sell them. In Scythia there is a\r\nbird, the size of the otis, which produces two young ones always, in\r\na hare’s skin suspended[3026] from the top branches of a tree. Pies,\r\nwhen they have observed a person steadily gazing at their nest, will\r\nimmediately remove their eggs to another place. This is said to be\r\naccomplished in a truly wonderful manner, by such birds as have not\r\ntoes adapted for holding and removing their eggs. They lay a twig upon\r\ntwo eggs, and then solder them to it by means of a glutinous matter\r\nsecreted from their body; after which, they pass their neck between the\r\neggs, and so forming an equipoise, convey them to another place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—THE MEROPS—PARTRIDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo less, too, is the shrewdness displayed by those birds which make\r\ntheir nests upon the ground, because, from the extreme weight of their\r\nbody, they are unable to fly aloft. There is a bird, known as the\r\n“merops,”[3027] which feeds its parents in their retreat: the colour of\r\nthe plumage on the inside is pale, and azure without, while it is of a\r\nsomewhat reddish hue at the extremity of the wings: this bird builds\r\nits nest in a hole which it digs to the depth of six feet.\r\n\r\nPartridges[3028] fortify their retreat so well with thorns and shrubs,\r\nthat it is effectually protected against beasts of prey. They make a\r\nsoft bed for their eggs by burying them in the dust, but do not hatch\r\nthem where they are laid: that no suspicion may arise from the fact\r\nof their being seen repeatedly about the same spot, they carry them\r\naway to some other place. The females also conceal themselves from\r\ntheir mates, in order that they may not be delayed in the process\r\nof incubation, as the males, in consequence of the warmth of their\r\npassions, are apt to break the eggs. The males, thus deprived of the\r\nfemales, fall to fighting among themselves; and it is said that the one\r\nthat is conquered, is treated as a female by the other. Trogus Pompeius\r\ntells us that quails and dunghill cocks sometimes do the same; and\r\nadds, that wild partridges, when newly caught, or when beaten by the\r\nothers, are trodden promiscuously by the tame ones. Through the very\r\npugnacity thus inspired by the strength of their passions, these birds\r\nare often taken, as the leader of the whole covey frequently advances\r\nto fight with the decoy-bird of the fowler; as soon as he is taken,\r\nanother and then another will advance, all of which are caught in their\r\nturn. The females, again, are caught about the pairing season; for then\r\nthey will come forward to quarrel with the female decoy-bird of the\r\nfowler, and so drive her away. Indeed, in no other animal is there any\r\nsuch susceptibility in the sexual feelings; if the female only stands\r\nopposite to the male, while the wind is blowing from that direction,\r\nshe[3029] will become impregnated; and during this time she is in a\r\nstate of the greatest excitement, the beak being wide open and the\r\ntongue thrust out. The female will conceive also from the action of\r\nthe air, as the male flies above her, and very often from only hearing\r\nhis voice: indeed, to such a degree does passion get the better of her\r\naffection for her offspring, that although at the moment she is sitting\r\nfurtively and in concealment, she will, if she perceives the female\r\ndecoy-bird of the fowler approaching her mate, call him back, and\r\nsummon him away from the other, and voluntarily submit to his advances.\r\n\r\nIndeed, these birds are often carried away by such frantic madness,\r\nthat they will settle, being quite blinded by fear,[3030] upon the\r\nvery head of the fowler. If he happens to move in the direction of the\r\nnest, the female bird that is sitting will run and throw herself before\r\nhis feet, pretending to be over-heavy, or else weak in the loins, and\r\nthen, suddenly running or flying for a short distance before him, will\r\nfall down as though she had a wing broken, or else her feet; just as\r\nhe is about to catch her, she will then take another fly, and so keep\r\nbaffling him in his hopes, until she has led him to a considerable\r\ndistance from her nest. As soon as she is rid of her fears, and free\r\nfrom all maternal disquietude, she will throw herself on her back in\r\nsome furrow, and seizing a clod of earth with her claws, cover herself\r\nall over. It is supposed that the life of the partridge extends to\r\nsixteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52. (34.)—PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the partridge, it is in the pigeon that similar tendencies\r\nare to be seen in the same respect: but then, chastity is especially\r\nobserved by it, and promiscuous intercourse is a thing quite unknown.\r\nAlthough inhabiting a domicile in common with others, they will none\r\nof them violate the laws of conjugal fidelity: not one will desert\r\nits nest, unless it is either widower or widow. Although, too, the\r\nmales are very imperious, and sometimes even extremely exacting, the\r\nfemales put up with it: for in fact, the males sometimes suspect them\r\nof infidelity, though by nature they are incapable of it. On such\r\noccasions the throat of the male seems quite choked with indignation,\r\nand he inflicts severe blows with the beak: and then afterwards, to\r\nmake some atonement, he falls to billing, and by way of pressing his\r\namorous solicitations, sidles round and round the female with his feet.\r\nThey both of them manifest an equal degree of affection for their\r\noffspring; indeed, it is not unfrequently that this is a ground for\r\ncorrection, in consequence of the female being too slow in going to her\r\nyoung. When the female is sitting, the male renders her every attention\r\nthat can in any way tend to her solace and comfort. The first thing\r\nthat they do is to eject from the throat some saltish earth, which they\r\nhave digested, into the mouths of the young ones, in order to prepare\r\nthem in due time to receive their nutriment. It is a peculiarity of\r\nthe pigeon and of the turtle-dove, not to throw back the neck when\r\ndrinking, but to take in the water at a long draught, just as beasts of\r\nburden do.\r\n\r\n(35.) We read in some authors that the ring-dove lives so long as\r\nthirty years, and sometimes as much as forty, without any other\r\ninconvenience than the extreme length of the claws, which with them, in\r\nfact, is the chief mark of old age; they can be cut, however, without\r\nany danger. The voice of all these birds is similar, being composed\r\nof three notes, and then a mournful noise at the end. In winter they\r\nare silent, and they only recover their voice in the spring. Nigidius\r\nexpresses it as his opinion that the ring-dove will abandon the place,\r\nif she hears her name mentioned under the roof where she is sitting on\r\nher eggs: they hatch their young just after[3031] the summer solstice.\r\nPigeons and turtle-doves live eight years.\r\n\r\n(36.) The sparrow, on the other hand, which has an equal degree of\r\nsalaciousness, is short-lived in the extreme. It is said that the male\r\ndoes not live beyond a year; and as a ground for this belief, it is\r\nstated that at the beginning of spring, the black marks are never to be\r\nseen upon the beak which began to appear in the summer. The females,\r\nhowever, are said to live somewhat longer.\r\n\r\nPigeons have even a certain appreciation of glory. There is reason for\r\nbelieving that they are well aware of the colours of their plumage,\r\nand the various shades which it presents, and even in their very\r\nmode of flying they court our applause, as they cleave the air in\r\nevery direction. It is, indeed, through this spirit of ostentation\r\nthat they are handed over, fast bound as it were, to the hawk; for\r\nfrom the noise that they make, which, in fact, is only produced by\r\nthe flapping of their wings, their long feathers become twisted and\r\ndisordered: otherwise, when they can fly without any impediment, they\r\nare far swifter in their movements than the hawk. The robber, lurking\r\namid the dense foliage, keeps on the look-out for them, and seizes\r\nthem at the very moment that they are indulging their vainglorious\r\nself-complaisance.\r\n\r\n(37.) It is for this reason that it is necessary to keep along with\r\nthe pigeons the bird that is known as the “tinnunculus;”[3032] as it\r\nprotects them, and by its natural superiority scares away the hawk: so\r\nmuch so, indeed, that the hawk will vanish at the very sight of it,\r\nand the instant it hears its voice. Hence it is that the pigeons have\r\nan especial regard for this bird; and, it is said, if one of these\r\nbirds is buried at each of the four corners of the pigeon-house in\r\npots that have been newly glazed, the pigeons will not change their\r\nabode—a result which has been obtained by some by cutting a joint of\r\ntheir wings with an instrument of gold; for if any other were used,\r\nthe wounds would be not unattended with danger.—The pigeon in general\r\nmay be looked upon as a bird fond of change; they have the art, too,\r\namong themselves of gaining one another over, and so seducing their\r\ncompanions: hence it is that we frequently find them return attended by\r\nothers which they have enticed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—WONDERFUL THINGS DONE BY THEM; PRICES AT WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN\r\nSOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, pigeons have acted as messengers in affairs of\r\nimportance. During the siege of Mutina, Decimus Brutus, who was in the\r\ntown, sent despatches to the camp of the consuls[3033] fastened to\r\npigeons’ feet. Of what use to Antony then were his intrenchments, and\r\nall the vigilance of the besieging army? his nets, too, which he had\r\nspread in the river, while the messenger of the besieged was cleaving\r\nthe air?\r\n\r\nMany persons have quite a mania for pigeons—building towns for them on\r\nthe top of their roofs, and taking a pleasure in relating the pedigree\r\nand noble origin of each. Of this there is an ancient instance that is\r\nvery remarkable; L. Axius, a Roman of the equestrian order, shortly\r\nbefore the Civil War of Pompeius, sold a single pair for four hundred\r\ndenarii, as we learn from the writings of M. Varro.[3034] Countries\r\neven have gained renown for their pigeons; it is thought that those of\r\nCampania attain the largest size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54. (38.)—DIFFERENT MODES OF FLIGHT AND PROGRESSION IN BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flight of the pigeon also leads me to consider that of other birds\r\nas well. All other animals have one determinate mode of progression,\r\nwhich in every kind is always the same; it is birds alone that have\r\ntwo modes of moving—the one on the ground, the other in the air.\r\nSome of them walk, such as the crow, for instance; some hop, as the\r\nsparrow and the blackbird; some, again, run, as the partridge and the\r\nwoodhen; while others throw one foot before the other, the stork and\r\nthe crane, for instance. Then again, in their flight, some birds expand\r\ntheir wings, and, poising themselves in the air, only move them from\r\ntime to time; others move them more frequently, but then only at the\r\nextremities; while others expand them so as to expose the whole of the\r\nside. On the other hand, some fly with the greater part of the wings\r\nkept close to the side; and some, after striking the air once, others\r\ntwice, make their way through it, as though pressing upon it enclosed\r\nbeneath their wings; other birds dart aloft in a vertical direction,\r\nothers horizontally, and others come falling straight downwards. You\r\nwould almost think that some had been hurled upwards with a violent\r\neffort, and that others, again, had fallen straight down from aloft;\r\nwhile others are seen to spring forward in their flight. Ducks alone,\r\nand the other birds of that kind, in an instant raise themselves aloft,\r\ntaking a spring from the spot where they stand straight upwards towards\r\nthe heavens; and this they can do from out of the water even; hence it\r\nis that they are the only birds that can make their escape from the\r\npitfalls which we employ for the capture of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nThe vulture and the heavier wild birds can only fly after taking a\r\nrun, or else by commencing their flight from an elevated spot. They\r\nuse the tail by way of rudder. There are some birds that are able to\r\nsee all around them; others, again, have to turn the neck to do so.\r\nSome of them eat what they have seized, holding it in their feet. Many,\r\nas they fly, utter some cry; while on the other hand, many, in their\r\nflight, are silent. Some fly with the breast half upright, others with\r\nit held downwards, others fly obliquely, or else side-ways, and others\r\nfollowing the direction of the bill. Some, again, are borne along with\r\nthe head upwards; indeed the fact is, that if we were to see several\r\nkinds at the same moment, we should not suppose that they have to make\r\ntheir way in the same element.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55. (39.)—THE BIRDS CALLED APODES, OR CYPSELI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose birds which are known as “apodes”[3035] fly the most of all,\r\nbecause they are deprived of the use of their feet. By some persons\r\nthey are called “cypseli.” They are a species of swallow which build\r\ntheir nests in the rocks, and are the same birds that are to be seen\r\neverywhere at sea; indeed, however far a ship may go, however long its\r\nvoyage, and however great the distance from land, the apodes never\r\ncease to hover around it. Other birds settle and come to a stand,\r\nwhereas these know no repose but in the nest; they are always either on\r\nthe wing or else asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56. (40.)—RESPECTING THE FOOD OF BIRDS—THE CAPRIMULGUS, THE\r\nPLATEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instincts, also, of birds are no less varied, and more especially\r\nin relation to their food. “Caprimulgus”[3036] is the name of a bird,\r\nwhich is to all appearance a large blackbird; it thieves by night, as\r\nit cannot see during the day. It enters the folds of the shepherds,\r\nand makes straight for the udder of the she-goat, to suck the milk.\r\nThrough the injury thus inflicted the udder shrivels away, and the goat\r\nthat has been thus deprived of its milk, is afflicted with incipient\r\nblindness.\r\n\r\n“Platea”[3037] is the name of another, which pounces upon other birds\r\nwhen they have dived in the sea, and, seizing the head with its bill,\r\nmakes them let go their prey. This bird also swallows and fills itself\r\nwith shell-fish, shells and all; after the natural heat of its crop has\r\nsoftened them, it brings them up again, and then picking out the shells\r\nfrom the rest, selects the parts that are fit for food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (41.)—THE INSTINCTS OF BIRDS—THE CARDUELIS, THE TAURUS, THE\r\nANTHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farm-yard fowls have also a certain notion of religion; upon laying\r\nan egg they shudder all over, and then shake their feathers; after\r\nwhich they turn round and purify[3038] themselves, or else hallow[3039]\r\nthemselves and their eggs with some stalk or other. (42.) The\r\ncarduelis,[3040] which is the very smallest bird of any, will do what\r\nit is bid, not only with the voice but with the feet as well, and with\r\nthe beak, which serves it instead of hands. There is one bird, found\r\nin the territory of Arelate, that imitates the lowing of oxen, from\r\nwhich circumstance it has received the name of “taurus.”[3041] In other\r\nrespects it is of small size. Another bird, called the “anthus,”[3042]\r\nimitates the neighing of the horse; upon being driven from the pasture\r\nby the approach of the horses, it will mimic their voices—and this is\r\nthe method it takes of revenging itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—BIRDS WHICH SPEAK—THE PARROT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut above all, there are some birds that can imitate the human voice;\r\nthe parrot, for instance, which can even converse. India sends us\r\nthis bird, which it calls by the name of “sittaces;”[3043] the body\r\nis green all over, only it is marked with a ring of red around the\r\nneck. It will duly salute an emperor, and pronounce the words it has\r\nheard spoken; it is rendered especially frolicsome under the influence\r\nof wine. Its head is as hard as its beak; and this, when it is being\r\ntaught to talk, is beaten with a rod of iron, for otherwise it is quite\r\ninsensible to blows. When it lights on the ground it falls upon its\r\nbeak, and by resting upon it makes itself all the lighter for its feet,\r\nwhich are naturally weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59.—THE PIE WHICH FEEDS ON ACORNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magpie is much less famous for its talking qualities than the\r\nparrot, because it does not come from a distance, and yet it can speak\r\nwith much more distinctness. These birds love to hear words spoken\r\nwhich they can utter; and not only do they learn them, but are pleased\r\nat the task; and as they con them over to themselves with the greatest\r\ncare and attention, make no secret of the interest they feel. It is a\r\nwell-known fact, that a magpie has died before now, when it has found\r\nitself mastered by a difficult word that it could not pronounce. Their\r\nmemory, however, will fail them if they do not from time to time hear\r\nthe same word repeated; and while they are trying to recollect it, they\r\nwill show the most extravagant joy, if they happen to hear it. Their\r\nappearance, although there is nothing remarkable in it, is by no means\r\nplain; but they have quite sufficient beauty in their singular ability\r\nto imitate the human speech.\r\n\r\nIt is said, however, that it is only the kind[3044] of pie which feeds\r\nupon acorns that can be taught to speak; and that among these, those\r\nwhich[3045] have five toes on each foot can be taught with the greatest\r\nfacility; but in their case even, only during the first two years of\r\ntheir life. The magpie has a broader tongue than is usual with most\r\nother birds; which is the case also with all the other birds that can\r\nimitate the human voice; although some individuals of almost every kind\r\nhave the faculty of doing so.\r\n\r\nAgrippina, the wife of Claudius Cæsar, had a thrush that could imitate\r\nhuman speech, a thing that was never known before. At the moment\r\nthat I am writing this, the young Cæsars[3046] have a starling and\r\nsome nightingales that are being taught to talk in Greek and Latin;\r\nbesides which, they are studying their task the whole day, continually\r\nrepeating the new words that they have learnt, and giving utterance\r\nto phrases even of considerable length. Birds are taught to talk in a\r\nretired spot, and where no other voice can be heard, so as to interfere\r\nwith their lesson; a person sits by them, and continually repeats the\r\nwords he wishes them to learn, while at the same time he encourages\r\nthem by giving them food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60. (48.)—A SEDITION THAT AROSE AMONG THE ROMAN PEOPLE, IN\r\nCONSEQUENCE OF A RAVEN SPEAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us do justice, also, to the raven, whose merits have been attested\r\nnot only by the sentiments of the Roman people, but by the strong\r\nexpression, also, of their indignation. In the reign of Tiberius,\r\none of a brood of ravens that had bred on the top of the temple of\r\nCastor,[3047] happened to fly into a shoemaker’s shop that stood\r\nopposite: upon which, from a feeling of religious veneration, it was\r\nlooked upon as doubly recommended by the owner of the place. The bird,\r\nhaving been taught to speak at an early age, used every morning to\r\nfly to the Rostra, which look towards the Forum; here, addressing\r\neach by his name, it would salute Tiberius, and then the Cæsars[3048]\r\nGermanicus and Drusus, after which it would proceed to greet the Roman\r\npopulace as they passed, and then return to the shop: for several years\r\nit was remarkable for the constancy of its attendance. The owner of\r\nanother shoemaker’s shop in the neighbourhood, in a sudden fit of anger\r\nkilled the bird, enraged, as he would have had it appear, because with\r\nits ordure it had soiled some shoes of his. Upon this, there was such\r\nrage manifested by the multitude, that he was at once driven from that\r\npart of the city, and soon after put to death. The funeral, too, of the\r\nbird was celebrated with almost endless obsequies; the body was placed\r\nupon a litter carried upon the shoulders of two Æthiopians, preceded\r\nby a piper, and borne to the pile with garlands of every size and\r\ndescription. The pile was erected on the right-hand side of the Appian\r\nWay, at the second milestone from the City, in the field generally\r\nknown as the “field of Rediculus.”[3049] Thus did the rare talent of\r\na bird appear a sufficient ground to the Roman people for honouring\r\nit with funeral obsequies, as well as for inflicting punishment on a\r\nRoman citizen; and that, too, in a city in which no such crowds had\r\never escorted the funeral of any one out of the whole number of its\r\ndistinguished men, and where no one had been found to avenge the death\r\nof Scipio Æmilianus,[3050] the man who had destroyed Carthage and\r\nNumantia. This event happened in the consulship of M. Servilius and\r\nCaius Cestius, on the fifth day[3051] before the calends of April.\r\n\r\nAt the present day also, the moment that I am writing this, there is in\r\nthe city of Rome a crow which belongs to a Roman of equestrian rank,\r\nand was brought from Bætica. In the first place, it is remarkable[3052]\r\nfor its colour, which is of the deepest black, and at the same time it\r\nis able to pronounce several connected words, while it is repeatedly\r\nlearning fresh ones. Recently, too, there has been a story told about\r\nCraterus, surnamed Monoceros,[3053] in Erizena,[3054] a country of\r\nAsia, who was in the habit of hunting with the assistance of ravens,\r\nand used to carry them into the woods, perched on the tuft of his\r\nhelmet and on his shoulders. The birds used to keep on the watch\r\nfor game, and raise it; and by training he had brought this art to\r\nsuch a pitch of perfection, that even the wild ravens would attend\r\nhim in a similar manner when he went out. Some authors have thought\r\nthe following circumstance deserving of remembrance:—A crow that was\r\nthirsty was seen heaping stones into the urn on a monument, in which\r\nthere was some rain-water which it could not reach: and so, being\r\nafraid to go down to the water, by thus accumulating the stones, it\r\ncaused as much water to come within its reach as was necessary to\r\nsatisfy its thirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61. (44.)—THE BIRDS OF DIOMEDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor yet must I pass by the birds[3055] of Diomedes in silence. Juba\r\ncalls these birds “cataractæ,” and says that they have teeth and eyes\r\nof a fiery colour, while the rest of the body is white: that they\r\nalways have two chiefs, the one to lead the main body, the other to\r\ntake charge of the rear; that they excavate holes with their bills,\r\nand then cover them with hurdles, which they cover again with the\r\nearth that has been thus thrown up; that it is in these places they\r\nhatch their young; that each of these holes has two outlets; that one\r\nof them looks towards the east, and that by it they go forth to feed,\r\nreturning by the one which looks towards the west; and that when about\r\nto ease themselves, they always take to the wing, and fly against the\r\nwind. In one spot only throughout the whole earth are these birds to be\r\nseen, in the island, namely, which we have mentioned[3056] as famous\r\nfor the tomb and shrine of Diomedes, lying over against the coast of\r\nApulia: they bear a strong resemblance to the coot. When strangers who\r\nare barbarians arrive on that island, they pursue them with loud and\r\nclamorous cries, and only show courtesy to Greeks by birth; seeming\r\nthereby, with a wonderful discernment, to pay respect to them as the\r\nfellow-countrymen of Diomedes. Every day they fill their throats,\r\nand cover their feathers, with water, and so wash and purify the\r\ntemple there. From this circumstance arises the fable[3057] that the\r\ncompanions of Diomedes were metamorphosed into these birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62. (45.)—ANIMALS THAT CAN LEARN NOTHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ought not to omit, while we are speaking of instincts, that among\r\nbirds the swallow[3058] is quite incapable of being taught, and among\r\nland animals the mouse; while on the other hand, the elephant does what\r\nit is ordered, the lion submits to the yoke, and the sea-calf and many\r\nkinds of fishes are capable of being tamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63. (46.)—THE MODE OF DRINKING WITH BIRDS. THE PORPHYRIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds drink by suction; those which have a long neck taking their drink\r\nin a succession of draughts, and throwing the head back, as though\r\nthey were pouring the water down the throat. The porphyrio[3059] is\r\nthe only bird that seems to bite at the water as it drinks. The same\r\nbird has also other peculiarities of its own; for it will every now and\r\nthen dip its food in the water, and then lift it with its foot to its\r\nbill, using it as a hand. Those that are the most esteemed are found in\r\nCommagene. They have beaks and very long legs, of a red colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64. (47.)—THE HÆMATOPOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are the same characteristics in the hæmatopous[3060] also, a bird\r\nof much smaller size, although standing as high on the legs. It is a\r\nnative of Egypt, and has three toes on each foot; flies[3061] forming\r\nits principal food. If brought to Italy, it survives for a few days\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65.—THE FOOD OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the heavy birds are frugivorous; while those with a higher flight\r\nfeed upon flesh only. Among the aquatic birds, the divers[3062] are in\r\nthe habit of devouring what the other birds have disgorged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66.—THE PELICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pelican is similar in appearance to the swan, and it would be\r\nthought that there was no difference between them whatever, were\r\nit not for the fact that under the throat there is a sort of second\r\ncrop, as it were. It is in this that the ever-insatiate animal stows\r\neverything away, so much so, that the capacity of this pouch is quite\r\nastonishing. After having finished its search for prey, it discharges\r\nbit by bit what it has thus stowed away, and reconveys it by a sort of\r\nruminating process into its real stomach. The part of Gallia that lies\r\nnearest to the Northern Ocean produces this bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67.—FOREIGN BIRDS: THE PHALERIDES, THE PHEASANT, AND THE NUMIDICÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Hercynian Forest, in Germany, we hear of a singular[3063]\r\nkind of bird, the feathers of which shine at night like fire; the\r\nother birds there have nothing remarkable beyond the celebrity which\r\ngenerally attaches to objects situate at a distance.\r\n\r\n(48.) The phalerides,[3064] the most esteemed of all the aquatic birds,\r\nare found at Seleucia, the city of the Parthians of that name, and in\r\nAsia as well; and again, in Colchis, there is the pheasant,[3065] a\r\nbird with two tufts of feathers like ears, which it drops and raises\r\nevery now and then. The numidicæ[3066] come from Numidia, a part of\r\nAfrica: all these varieties are now to be found in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68.—THE PHŒNICOPTERUS, THE ATTAGEN, THE PHALACROCORAX, THE\r\nPYRRHOCORAX, AND THE LAGOPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nApicius, that very deepest whirlpool of all our epicures, has informed\r\nus that the tongue of the phœnicopterus[3067] is of the most exquisite\r\nflavour. The attagen,[3068] also, of Ionia is a famous bird; but\r\nalthough it has a voice at other times, it is mute in captivity. It was\r\nformerly[3069] reckoned among the rare birds, but at the present day it\r\nis found in Gallia, Spain, and in the Alps even; which is also the case\r\nwith the phalacrocorax,[3070] a bird peculiar to the Balearic Isles, as\r\nthe pyrrhocorax,[3071] a black bird with a yellow bill, is to the Alps,\r\nand the lagopus,[3072] which is esteemed for its excellent flavour.\r\nThis last bird derives its name from its feet, which are covered, as\r\nit were, with the fur of a hare, the rest of the body being white, and\r\nthe size of a pigeon. It is not an easy matter to taste it out of its\r\nnative country, as it never becomes domesticated, and when dead it\r\nquickly spoils.\r\n\r\nThere is another[3073] bird also, which has the same name, and only\r\ndiffers from the quail in size; it is of a saffron colour, and is most\r\ndelicate eating. Egnatius Calvinus, who was prefect there, pretends\r\nthat he has seen[3074] in the Alps the ibis also, a bird that is\r\npeculiar to Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69. (49.)—THE NEW BIRDS. THE VIPIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the civil wars that took place at Bebriacum, beyond the river\r\nPadus, the “new birds”[3075] were introduced into Italy—for by that\r\nname they are still known. They resemble the thrush in appearance, are\r\na little smaller than the pigeon in size, and of an agreeable flavour.\r\nThe Balearic islands also send us a porphyrio,[3076] that is superior\r\nto the one previously mentioned. There the buteo, a kind of hawk, is\r\nheld in high esteem for the table, as also the vipio,[3077] the name\r\ngiven to a small kind of crane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70.—FABULOUS BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look upon the birds as fabulous which are called “pegasi,” and are\r\nsaid to have a horse’s head; as also the griffons, with long ears and\r\na hooked beak. The former are said to be natives of Scythia,[3078]\r\nthe latter of Æthiopia. The same is my opinion, also, as to the\r\ntragopan;[3079] many writers, however, assert that it is larger than\r\nthe eagle, has curved horns on the temples, and a plumage of iron\r\ncolour, with the exception of the head, which is purple. Nor yet do the\r\nsirens[3080] obtain any greater credit with me, although Dinon, the\r\nfather of Clearchus, a celebrated writer, asserts that they exist in\r\nIndia, and that they charm men by their song, and, having first lulled\r\nthem to sleep, tear them to pieces. The person, however, who may think\r\nfit to believe in these tales, may probably not refuse to believe also\r\nthat dragons licked the ears of Melampodes, and bestowed upon him the\r\npower of understanding the language of birds; as also what Democritus\r\nsays, when he gives the names of certain birds, by the mixture of whose\r\nblood a serpent is produced, the person who eats of which will be able\r\nto understand the language of birds; as well as the statements which\r\nthe same writer makes relative to one bird in particular, known as the\r\n“galerita,”[3081]—indeed, the science of augury is already too much\r\ninvolved in embarrassing questions, without these fanciful reveries.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of bird spoken of by Homer as the “scops:”[3082] but\r\nI cannot very easily comprehend the grotesque movements which many\r\npersons have attributed to it, when the fowler is laying snares for\r\nit; nor, indeed, is it a bird that is any longer known to exist.\r\nIt will be better, therefore, to confine my relation to those the\r\nexistence of which is generally admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 71. (50.)—WHO FIRST INVENTED THE ART OF CRAMMING POULTRY: WHY THE\r\nFIRST CENSORS FORBADE THIS PRACTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Delos were the first to cram poultry; and it is with them\r\nthat originated that abominable mania for devouring fattened birds,\r\nlarded with the grease of their own bodies. I find in the ancient\r\nsumptuary regulations as to banquets, that this was forbidden for the\r\nfirst time by a law of the consul Caius Fannius, eleven years before\r\nthe Third Punic War; by which it was ordered that no bird should be\r\nserved at table beyond a single pullet, and that not fattened; an\r\narticle which has since made its appearance in all the sumptuary[3083]\r\nlaws. A method, however, has been devised of evading it, by feeding\r\npoultry upon food that has been soaked in milk: prepared in this\r\nfashion, they are considered even still more delicate. All pullets,\r\nhowever, are not looked upon as equally good for the purposes of\r\nfattening, and only those are selected which have a fatty skin about\r\nthe neck. Then, too, come all the arts of the kitchen—that the thighs\r\nmay have a nice plump appearance, that the bird may be properly divided\r\ndown the back, and that poultry may be brought to such a size that a\r\nsingle leg shall fill a whole platter.[3084] The Parthians, too, have\r\ntaught their fashions to our cooks; and yet after all, in spite of\r\ntheir refinements in luxury, no article is found to please equally in\r\nevery part, for in one it is the thigh, and in another the breast only,\r\nthat is esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 72.—WHO FIRST INVENTED AVIARIES. THE DISH OF ÆSOPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first person who invented aviaries for the reception of all kinds\r\nof birds was M. Lænius Strabo, a member of the equestrian order,\r\nwho resided at Brundisium. It was in his time that we thus began to\r\nimprison animals to which Nature had assigned the heavens as their\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n(51.) But more remarkable than anything in this respect, is the story\r\nof the dish of Clodius Æsopus,[3085] the tragic actor, which was valued\r\nat one hundred thousand sesterces, and in which were served up nothing\r\nbut birds that had been remarkable for their song, or their imitation\r\nof the human voice, and purchased, each of them, at the price of six\r\nthousand sesterces; he being induced to this folly by no other pleasure\r\nthan that in these he might eat the closest imitators of man; never for\r\na moment reflecting that his own immense fortune had been acquired by\r\nthe advantages of his voice; a parent, indeed, right worthy of the son\r\nof whom we have already made mention,[3086] as swallowing pearls. It\r\nwould not, to say the truth, be very easy to come to a conclusion which\r\nof the two was guilty of the greatest baseness; unless, indeed, we\r\nare ready to admit that it was less unseemly to banquet upon the most\r\ncostly of all the productions of Nature, than to devour[3087] tongues\r\nwhich had given utterance to the language of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 73. (52.)—THE GENERATION OF BIRDS: OTHER OVIPAROUS ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generation of birds would appear to be very simple, while at the\r\nsame time it has its own peculiar marvels. Indeed, there are quadrupeds\r\nas well that produce eggs, the chameleon, for instance, the lizard, and\r\nthose of the serpent tribe of which we have previously spoken.[3088] Of\r\nthe feathered race, those which have hooked talons are comparatively\r\nunprolific; the cenchris[3089] being the only one among them that lays\r\nmore than four eggs. Nature has so ordained it in the birds, that the\r\ntimid ones should be more prolific than those which are courageous. The\r\nostrich, the common fowl, and the partridge, are the only birds that\r\nlay eggs in considerable numbers. Birds have two modes of coupling,\r\nthe female crouching on the ground, as in the barn-door fowl, or else\r\nstanding, as is the case with the crane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 74.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF EGGS, AND THEIR NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome eggs are white, as those of the pigeon and partridge, for\r\ninstance; others are of a pale colour, as in the aquatic birds: others,\r\nagain, are dotted all over with spots, as is the case with those of the\r\nmeleagris; others are red, like those of the pheasant and the cenchris.\r\nIn the inside, the eggs of all birds are of two colours; those of the\r\naquatic kind have more of the yellow than the white, and the yellow is\r\nof a paler tint than in those of other birds. Among fish, the eggs are\r\nof the same colour throughout, there being, in fact, no white. The eggs\r\nof birds are of a brittle nature, in consequence of the natural heat\r\nof the animal, while those of serpents are supple, in consequence of\r\ntheir coldness, and those of fish soft, from their natural humidity.\r\nAgain, the eggs of aquatic birds are round, while those of most other\r\nkinds are elongated, and taper to a point. Eggs are laid with the round\r\nend foremost, and at the moment that they are laid the shell is soft,\r\nbut it immediately grows hard, as each portion becomes exposed to the\r\nair. Horatius Flaccus[3090] expresses it as his opinion that those eggs\r\nwhich are of an oblong shape are of the most agreeable flavour. The\r\nrounder eggs are those which produce[3091] the female, the others the\r\nmale. The umbilical[3092] cord is in the upper part of the egg, like a\r\ndrop floating on the surface in the shell.\r\n\r\n(53.) There are some birds that couple at all seasons of the year,\r\nbarn-door fowls, for instance; they lay, too, at all times, with the\r\nexception of two months at mid-winter. Pullets lay more eggs than the\r\nolder hens, but then they are smaller. In the same brood those chickens\r\nare the smallest that are hatched the first and the last. These\r\nanimals, indeed, are so prolific, that some of them will lay as many as\r\nsixty eggs, some daily, some twice a day, and some in such vast numbers\r\nthat they have been known to die from exhaustion. Those known as the\r\n“Adrianæ,”[3093] are the most esteemed. Pigeons sit ten times a year,\r\nand some of them eleven, and in Egypt during the month of the winter\r\nsolstice even. Swallows, blackbirds, ring-doves, and turtle-doves sit\r\ntwice a year, most other birds only once. Thrushes make their nests\r\nof mud, in the tops of trees, almost touching one another, and lay\r\nduring the time of their retirement. The egg comes to maturity in the\r\novary ten days after treading; but if the hen or pigeon is tormented\r\nby pulling out the feathers, or by the infliction of any injury of a\r\nsimilar nature, the maturing of the egg is retarded.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the yolk of every egg there is what appears to be a\r\nlittle drop[3094] of blood; this is supposed to be the heart of the\r\nchicken, it being the general belief that that part is formed the first\r\nin every animal: at all events, while in the egg this speck is seen\r\nto throb and palpitate. The body of the animal itself is formed from\r\nthe white fluid[3095] in the egg; while the yellow part constitutes\r\nits food. The head in every kind, while in the shell, is larger than\r\nthe rest of the body; the eyes, too, are closed, and are larger than\r\nthe other parts of the head. As the chicken grows, the white gradually\r\npasses to the middle of the egg, while the yellow is spread around\r\nit. On the twentieth day, if the egg is shaken, the voice of the now\r\nliving animal can be heard in the shell. From this time it gradually\r\nbecomes clothed with feathers; and its position is such that it has\r\nthe head above the right foot, and the right wing above the head: the\r\nyolk in the meantime gradually disappears. All birds are born with the\r\nfeet first, while with every other animal the contrary is the case.\r\nSome hens lay all their eggs with two yolks, and sometimes hatch twin\r\nchickens from the same egg, one being larger than the other, according\r\nto Cornelius Celsus: other writers, however, deny[3096] the possibility\r\nof twin chickens being hatched. It is a rule never to give a brood hen\r\nmore than twenty-five[3097] eggs to sit upon at once. Hens begin to lay\r\nimmediately after the winter solstice. The best broods are those which\r\nare hatched before the vernal equinox: chickens that are hatched after\r\nthe summer solstice, never attain their full growth, and the more so,\r\nthe later they are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 75. (54.)—DEFECTS IN BROOD-HENS, AND THEIR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose eggs which have been laid within the last ten days, are the\r\nbest for putting under the hen; old ones, or those which have just\r\nbeen laid, will be unfruitful; an uneven number[3098] also ought to\r\nbe placed. On the fourth day after the hen has begun to sit, if,\r\nupon taking an egg with one hand by the two ends and holding it up\r\nto the light, it is found to be clear and of one uniform colour, it\r\nis most likely to be barren, and another should be substituted in\r\nits place. There is also a way of testing them by means of water; an\r\nempty egg will float on the surface, while those that fall to the\r\nbottom, or, in other words, are full, should be placed under the hen.\r\nCare must be taken, however, not to make trial by shaking them, for\r\nif the organs which are necessary for life become confused, they will\r\ncome to nothing.[3099] Incubation ought to begin just after the new\r\nmoon; for, if commenced before, the eggs will be unproductive. The\r\nchickens are hatched sooner if the weather is warm: hence it is that\r\nin summer they break the shell on the nineteenth day, but in winter\r\non the twenty-fifth only. If it happens to thunder during the time of\r\nincubation, the eggs are addled, and if the cry of a hawk is heard\r\nthey are spoilt. The best remedy against the effects of thunder, is to\r\nput an iron nail beneath the straw on which the eggs are laid, or else\r\nsome earth from off a ploughshare. Some eggs, however, are hatched by\r\nthe spontaneous action of Nature, without the process of incubation,\r\nas is the case in the dung-hills of Egypt. There is a well-known story\r\nrelated about a man at Syracuse, who was in the habit of covering eggs\r\nwith earth,[3100] and then continuing his drinking bout till they were\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 76. (55.)—AN AUGURY DERIVED FROM EGGS BY AN EMPRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, what is even more singular still, eggs can be hatched also by\r\na human being. Julia Augusta, when pregnant in her early youth of\r\nTiberius Cæsar, by Nero, was particularly desirous that her offspring\r\nshould be a son, and accordingly employed the following mode of\r\ndivination, which was then much in use among young women: she carried\r\nan egg in her bosom, taking care, whenever she was obliged to put it\r\ndown, to give it to her nurse to warm in her own, that there might be\r\nno interruption in the heat: it is stated that the result promised by\r\nthis mode of augury was not falsified.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps from this circumstance, that the modern invention took\r\nits rise, of placing eggs in a warm spot and covering them with chaff,\r\nthe heat being maintained by a moderate fire, while in the meantime\r\na man is employed in turning them. By the adoption of this plan, the\r\nyoung, all of them, break the shell on a stated day. There is a story\r\ntold of a breeder of poultry, of such remarkable skill, that on seeing\r\nan egg he could tell which hen had laid it. It is said also that when\r\na hen has happened to die while sitting, the males have been seen\r\nto take her place in turns, and perform all the other duties of a\r\nbrood-hen, taking care in the meantime to abstain from crowing. But\r\nthe most remarkable thing of all, is the sight of a hen, beneath which\r\nducks’ eggs have been put and hatched.—At first, she is unable to\r\nquite recognize the brood as her own, while in her anxiety she gives\r\nutterance to her clucking as she doubtfully calls them; then at last\r\nshe will stand at the margin of the pond, uttering her laments, while\r\nthe ducklings, with Nature for their guide, are diving beneath the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 77. (56.)—THE BEST KINDS OF FOWLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breed of a fowl is judged of by the erectness of the crest, which\r\nis sometimes double, its black wings, reddish beak, and toes of unequal\r\nnumber, there being sometimes a fifth placed transversely above the\r\nother four. For the purposes of divination, those that have a yellow\r\nbeak and feet are not considered pure; while for the secret rites of\r\nBona Dea, black ones are chosen. There is also a dwarf[3101] species\r\nof fowl, which is not barren either; a thing that is the case with no\r\nother kind of bird. These dwarfs, however, rarely lay at any stated\r\nperiods, and their incubation is productive of injury[3102] to the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 78. (57.)—THE DISEASES OF FOWLS, AND THEIR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous malady with every kind of fowl is that known as the\r\n“pituita;;”[3103] which is prevalent more particularly between the\r\ntimes of harvest and vintage. The mode of treatment is to put them on a\r\nspare diet, and to expose them, while asleep, to the action of smoke,\r\nand more especially that of bay leaves or of the herb called savin. A\r\nfeather also is inserted, and passed across through the nostrils, care\r\nbeing taken to move it every day; while their food consists of leeks\r\nmixed with speltmeal, or else is first soaked in water in which an\r\nowlet has been dipped, or boiled together with the seeds of the white\r\nvine. There are also some other receipts besides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 79. (58.)—WHEN BIRDS LAY, AND HOW MANY EGGS. THE VARIOUS KINDS OF\r\nHERONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPigeons have the peculiarity of billing before they couple; they\r\ngenerally lay two eggs, Nature so willing it, that among birds the\r\nproduce should be more frequent with some, and more numerous with\r\nothers. The ring-dove and turtle-dove mostly lay three eggs, and never\r\nmore than twice, in the spring; such being the case when the first\r\nbrood has been lost. Although they may happen to lay three eggs, they\r\nnever hatch more than two; the third egg, which is barren, is generally\r\nknown by the name of “urinum.”[3104] The female ring-dove sits on the\r\neggs from mid-day till morning, the male the rest of the time. Pigeons\r\nalways produce a male and a female; the male first, the female the\r\nday after. Both the male and the female pigeon sit on the eggs; the\r\nmale in the day-time, the female during the night. They hatch on the\r\ntwentieth day of incubation, and lay the fifth day after coupling.\r\nSometimes, indeed, in summer, these birds will rear three couples in\r\ntwo months; for then they hatch on the eighteenth day of incubation,\r\nand immediately conceive again; hence it is that eggs are often found\r\namong the young ones, some of which last are just taking wing, while\r\nothers are only bursting the shell. The young ones, themselves, begin\r\nto produce at the age of five months. The females, if there should\r\nhappen to be no male among them, will even tread each other, and lay\r\nbarren eggs, from which nothing is produced. By the Greeks, these eggs\r\nare called “hypenemia.”[3105]\r\n\r\n(59.) The pea-hen produces at three years old. In the first year\r\nshe will lay one or two eggs, in the next four or five, and in the\r\nremaining years twelve, but never beyond that number. She lays for two\r\nor three days at intervals, and will produce three broods in the year,\r\nif care is taken to put the eggs under a common hen. The males are apt\r\nto break the eggs in getting at the females while sitting, and hence it\r\nis that the pea-hen lays by night, and in secret places, or else sits\r\non her eggs in an elevated spot; the eggs will break, too, unless they\r\nare received upon some surface that is soft. One male is sufficient for\r\nevery five females; when there are only one or two females to a male,\r\nall chance of their being prolific is spoilt through their extreme\r\nsalaciousness. The young breaks the shell in twenty-seven days, or, at\r\nthe very latest, on the thirtieth.\r\n\r\nGeese pair in the water, and lay in spring; or, if they have paired\r\nin the winter, they lay about forty eggs, after the summer solstice.\r\nThe hatching takes place twice in the year, if a hen hatches the first\r\nbrood; otherwise, their greatest number of eggs will be sixteen,\r\ntheir lowest seven. If their eggs are taken away from them, they will\r\nkeep on laying until they burst; they will not hatch the eggs of any\r\nother birds. The best number of eggs for placing under the goose for\r\nhatching, is nine, or else eleven. The females only sit, and that for\r\nthirty days; but if they are kept very warm, then only twenty-five. The\r\ncontact of the nettle is fatal to their young, and their own greediness\r\nis no less so—sometimes, through over-eating, and sometimes through\r\nover-exertion; for seizing the root of a plant with the bill, they will\r\nmake repeated efforts to tear it out of the ground, and so, at last,\r\ndislocate the neck. A remedy against the noxious effects of the nettle,\r\nis to place the root of that plant under the straw of their nest.\r\n\r\n(60.) There are three kinds of herons, called, respectively, the\r\nleucon,[3106] the asterias,[3107] and the pellos.[3108] These birds\r\nexperience great pain in coupling; uttering loud cries, the males\r\nbleed from the eyes, while the females lay their eggs with no less\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe eagle sits for thirty days, as do most of the larger birds; the\r\nsmaller ones, the kite and the hawk for instance, only twenty. The\r\neagle mostly lays but one egg, never more than three. The bird which\r\nis known as the “ægolios,”[3109] lays four, and the raven sometimes\r\nfive; they sit, too, the same number of days as the kite and the hawk.\r\nThe male crow provides the female with food while she is sitting. The\r\nmagpie lays nine eggs, the malancoryphus more than twenty, but always\r\nan uneven number, and no bird of this kind ever lays more; so much\r\nsuperior in fecundity are the smaller birds. The young ones of the\r\nswallow are blind at first, as is the case also with almost all the\r\nbirds the progeny of which is numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 80.—WHAT EGGS ARE CALLED HYPENEMIA, AND WHAT CYNOSURA. HOW EGGS\r\nARE BEST KEPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe barren eggs, which we have mentioned as “hypenemia,” are either\r\nconceived by the females when they are influenced by libidinous\r\nfancies, and couple with one another, or else at the moment when they\r\nare rolling themselves in the dust; they are produced not only by the\r\npigeon, but by the common hen as well, the partridge, the pea-hen, the\r\ngoose, and the chenalopex; these eggs are barren, smaller than the\r\nothers, of a less agreeable flavour, and more humid. There are some who\r\nthink that they are generated by the wind, for which reason they give\r\nthem the name of “zephyria.” The eggs known as “urina,” and which by\r\nsome are called “cynosura,”[3110] are only laid in the spring, and at a\r\ntime when the hen has discontinued sitting. Eggs, if soaked in vinegar,\r\nare rendered so soft thereby, that they may be twisted[3111] round the\r\nfinger like a ring. The best method of preserving them is to keep them\r\npacked in bean-meal, or chaff, during the winter, and in bran during\r\nthe summer. It is a general belief, that if kept in salt, they will\r\nlose their contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 81. (61.)—THE ONLY WINGED ANIMAL THAT IS VIVIPAROUS, AND NURTURES\r\nITS YOUNG WITH ITS MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the winged animals, the only one that is viviparous is the bat;\r\nit is the only one, too, that has wings formed of a membrane. This is,\r\nalso, the only winged creature that feeds its young with milk from\r\nthe breast. The mother clasps her two young ones as she flies, and so\r\ncarries them along with her. This animal, too, is said to have but one\r\njoint in the haunch, and to be particularly fond of gnats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 82. (62.)—TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS THAT ARE OVIPAROUS.—VARIOUS KINDS\r\nOF SERPENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, among the terrestrial animals, there are the serpents that are\r\noviparous; of which, as yet, we have not spoken. These creatures couple\r\nby clasping each other, and entwine so closely around one another, that\r\nthey might be taken for only one animal with two heads. The male viper\r\nthrusts[3112] its head into the mouth of the female, which gnaws it in\r\nthe transports of its passion. This, too, is the only one among the\r\nterrestrial animals that lays eggs within its body—of one colour, and\r\nsoft, like those of fishes. On the third day it hatches its young in\r\nthe uterus, and then excludes them, one every day, and generally twenty\r\nin number; the last ones become so impatient of their confinement,\r\nthat they force a passage through the sides of their parent, and so\r\nkill her. Other serpents, again, lay eggs attached to one another, and\r\nthen bury them in the earth; the young being hatched in the following\r\nyear. Crocodiles sit on their eggs in turns, first the male, and then\r\nthe female. But let us now turn to the generation of the rest of the\r\nterrestrial animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 83. (63.)—GENERATION OF ALL KINDS OF TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only one among the bipeds that is viviparous is man. Man is the\r\nonly animal that repents of his first embraces; sad augury, indeed, of\r\nlife, that its very origin should thus cause repentance! Other animals\r\nhave stated times in the year for their embraces; but man, as we have\r\nalready[3113] observed, employs for this purpose all hours both of\r\nday and night; other animals become sated with venereal pleasures,\r\nman hardly knows any satiety. Messalina,[3114] the wife of Claudius\r\nCæsar, thinking this a palm quite worthy of an empress, selected, for\r\nthe purpose of deciding the question, one of the most notorious of\r\nthe women who followed the profession of a hired prostitute; and the\r\nempress outdid her, after continuous intercourse, night and day, at\r\nthe twenty-fifth embrace. In the human race also, the men have devised\r\nvarious substitutes for the more legitimate exercise of passion, all of\r\nwhich outrage Nature; while the females have recourse to abortion. How\r\nmuch more guilty than the brute beasts are we in this respect! Hesiod\r\nhas stated that men are more lustful in winter, women in summer.\r\n\r\nCoupling is performed back to back by the elephant, the camel, the\r\ntiger, the lynx, the rhinoceros, the lion, the dasypus, and the rabbit,\r\nthe genital parts of all which animals lie far back. Camels even seek\r\ndesert places, or, at all events, spots of a retired nature; and to\r\ncome upon them on such an occasion is not unattended with danger.\r\nCoupling, with them, lasts a whole day; the only animal, indeed, of\r\nall those with solid hoofs, with which such is the case. Among the\r\nquadrupeds, it is the smell that excites the passions of the male. In\r\nthis act, dogs also, seals, and wolves turn back to back, and remain\r\nattached, though greatly against their will. In the greater part of\r\nthe animals above mentioned, the females solicit the males; in some,\r\nhowever, the males the females. As to bears, they lie down, like the\r\nhuman race, as previously[3115] mentioned by us; while hedgehogs\r\nembrace standing upright. In cats, the male stands above, while the\r\nfemale assumes a crouching posture; foxes lie on the side, the female\r\nembracing the male. In the case of the cow and the hind, the female\r\nis unable to endure the violence of the male, consequently she keeps\r\nin motion during the time of coupling. The buck goes from one hind\r\nto another in turn, and then comes back to the first. Lizards couple\r\nentwined around each other, like the animals without feet.\r\n\r\nAll animals, the larger they are in bulk, are proportionably less\r\nprolific: the elephant, the camel, and the horse produce but one,\r\nwhile the acanthis,[3116] a very small bird, produces twelve. Those\r\nanimals, also, which are the most prolific, are the shortest time in\r\nbreeding. The larger an animal is, the longer is the time required for\r\nits formation in the womb; those, also, which are the longest-lived,\r\nrequire the longest gestation; the growing age, too, is not suitable\r\nfor the purposes of generation. Those animals which have solid hoofs\r\nbear but a single young one, while those which have cloven hoofs bear\r\ntwo. Those, again, whose feet are divided into toes, have a still more\r\nnumerous offspring; but, while the others bring forth their young\r\nperfect, these last bear them in an unformed state, such, for instance,\r\nas the lioness and the she-bear. The fox also brings forth its young in\r\nan even more imperfect state than these; it is a very uncommon thing,\r\nhowever, to find it whelping. After the birth, these animals warm their\r\nyoung by licking them, and thereby give them their proper shape; they\r\nmostly produce four at a birth.\r\n\r\nThe dog, the wolf, the panther, and the jackal produce their young\r\nblind. There are several kinds of dogs; those of Laconia,[3117] of both\r\nsexes, are ready for breeding in the eighth month, and the females\r\ncarry their young sixty or sixty-three days at most; other dogs are\r\nfit for breeding when only six months old; the female, in all cases,\r\nbecomes pregnant at the first congress. Those which have conceived\r\nbefore the proper age, bear pups which are longer blind, though not\r\nall the same number of days. It is thought that dogs, in general, lift\r\nthe leg when they water at six months old; this, too, is looked upon\r\nas a sign that they have attained their full growth and strength; when\r\ndoing this, the female squats. The most numerous litters known consist\r\nof twelve, but more generally five or six is the number; sometimes,\r\nindeed, only one is produced, but then it is looked upon as a prodigy,\r\nand the same is the case, too, when all the pups are of one sex. In the\r\ndog, the males come into the world first, but in other animals, the two\r\nsexes are born alternately. The female admits the male again six months\r\nafter she has littered. Those of the Laconian breed bear eight young\r\nones. It is a peculiarity in this kind, that after undergoing great\r\nlabour, the males are remarkable for their salacity. In the Laconian\r\nbreed the male lives ten years, the female twelve; while other kinds,\r\nagain, live fifteen years, and sometimes as much as twenty; but they\r\nare not fit for breeding to the end of their life, as they generally\r\ncease at about the twelfth year. The cat and the ichneumon are, in\r\nother respects,[3118] like the dog; but they only live six years.\r\n\r\nThe dasypus[3119] brings forth every month in the year, and is subject\r\nto superfœtation, like the hare. It conceives immediately after it has\r\nlittered, even though it is still suckling its young, which are blind\r\nat their birth. The elephant, as we have already[3120] stated, produces\r\nbut one, and that the size of a calf three months old. The gestation of\r\nthe camel lasts twelve months; the female conceives when three years\r\nold, and brings forth in the spring; at the end of a year from that\r\ntime, she is ready to conceive again. It is thought advisable to have\r\nthe mare covered so soon as three days, and indeed, sometimes, only\r\none, after she has foaled; and, however unwilling she may be, means\r\nare taken to compel her. It is believed also, that it is by no means\r\nan uncommon thing for a woman to conceive on the seventh day after her\r\ndelivery. It is recommended that the manes of mares should be cut, so\r\nas to humble their pride, in order to make them submit to be covered by\r\nthe male ass; for when the mane is long, they are liable to be proud\r\nand vain. This is the only animal, the female of which, after covering,\r\nruns, facing the north or the south, according as she has conceived\r\na male or a female. They change their colour immediately after, and\r\nthe hair becomes of a redder hue, and deeper, whatever the colour may\r\nnaturally be; it is this that indicates that they must no longer be\r\ncovered, and they, themselves, will even resist it. Gestation does not,\r\nhowever, preclude some of them from being worked, and they are often\r\nwith foal long before it is known. We read that the mare of Echecrates,\r\nthe Thessalian, conquered at the Olympic games, while with foal.\r\n\r\nThose who are more careful enquirers into these matters, tell us that\r\nin the horse, the dog, and the swine, the males are most ardent for\r\nsexual intercourse in the morning, while the female seeks the society\r\nof the male after mid-day. They say also, that mares in harness desire\r\nthe horse sixty days sooner than those that live in herds; that it is\r\nswine only that foam at the mouth during the time of coupling; and that\r\na boar, if it hears the voice of a sow in heat, will refuse to take\r\nits food,—to such a degree, indeed, as to starve itself, if it is not\r\nallowed to cover—while the female is reduced to such a state of frantic\r\nmadness, as to attack and tear a man, more especially if wearing a\r\nwhite garment. This frenzy, however, is appeased by sprinkling vinegar\r\non the sexual parts. It is supposed also that salacity is promoted by\r\ncertain aliments; the herb rocket, for instance, in the case of man,\r\nand onions in that of cattle. Wild animals that have been tamed, do\r\nnot conceive, the goose, for instance; the wild boar and the stag will\r\nonly produce late in life, and even then they must have been taken and\r\ntamed when very young; a singular fact. The pregnant females, among\r\nthe quadrupeds, refuse the male, with the exception, indeed, of the\r\nmare and the sow; superfœtation, however, takes place in none but the\r\ndasypus and the hare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 84. (64.)—THE POSITION OF ANIMALS IN THE UTERUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll those animals that are viviparous produce their young with the head\r\nfirst, the young animal about the time of yeaning turning itself round\r\nin the womb, where at other times it lies extended at full length.\r\nQuadrupeds during the time of gestation have the legs extended, and\r\nlying close to the belly; while, on the other hand, man is gathered up\r\ninto a ball, with the nose between the knees. With reference to moles,\r\nof which we have previously[3121] spoken, it is supposed that they are\r\nproduced when a female has conceived, not by a male, but of herself\r\nonly. Hence it is that there is no vitality in this false conception,\r\nbecause it does not proceed from the conjunction of the two sexes; and\r\nit has only that sort of vegetative existence in itself which we see in\r\nplants and trees.\r\n\r\n(65.) Of all those which produce their young in a perfect state, the\r\nswine is the only one that bears them in considerable numbers as well;\r\nand, indeed, several times in the year—a thing that is contrary to the\r\nusual nature of animals with a solid or cloven hoof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 85.—ANIMALS WHOSE ORIGIN IS STILL UNKNOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is mice that surpass all the other animals in fecundity; and\r\nit is not without some hesitation that I speak of them, although I\r\nhave Aristotle and some of the officers of Alexander the Great for\r\nmy authority. It is said that these animals generate by licking one\r\nanother, and not by copulation. They have related cases where a single\r\nfemale has given birth to one hundred and twenty young ones, and in\r\nPersia some were found, even pregnant themselves,[3122] while yet in\r\nthe womb of the parent. It is believed also that these animals will\r\nbecome pregnant on tasting salt. Hence we find that we have no longer\r\nany reason to wonder how such vast multitudes of field-mice devastate\r\nthe standing corn; though it is still a mystery, with reference to\r\nthem, in what way it is that such multitudes die so suddenly; for\r\ntheir dead bodies are never to be found, and there is not a person in\r\nexistence that has ever dug up a mouse in a field during the winter.\r\nMultitudes of these animals visit Troas, and before this they have\r\ndriven away the inhabitants in consequence of their vast numbers.\r\n\r\nThey multiply greatly during times of drought; it is said also that\r\nwhen they are about to die, a little worm grows in their head. The mice\r\nof Egypt have hard hairs, just like those of the hedge-hog. They walk\r\non their hind feet, as also do those of the Alps. When two animals\r\ncouple of different kinds, the union is only prolific if the time of\r\ngestation is the same in both. Among the oviparous quadrupeds, it is\r\ngenerally believed that the lizard brings forth by the mouth, though\r\nAristotle denies the fact. These animals, too, do not sit upon their\r\neggs, as they forget in what place they have laid them, being utterly\r\ndestitute of memory; hence it is that the young ones are hatched\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 86. (66.)—SALAMANDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find it stated by many authors,[3123] that a serpent is produced\r\nfrom the spinal marrow of a man. Many creatures, in fact, among the\r\nquadrupeds even, have a secret and mysterious origin.\r\n\r\n(67) Thus, for instance, the salamander, an animal like a lizard in\r\nshape, and with a body starred all over, never comes out except during\r\nheavy showers, and disappears the moment it becomes fine. This animal\r\nis so intensely cold as to extinguish fire by its contact, in the same\r\nway as ice does. It spits forth a milky matter from its mouth; and\r\nwhatever part of the human body is touched with this, all the hair\r\nfalls off, and the part assumes the appearance of leprosy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 87. (68.)—ANIMALS WHICH ARE BORN OF BEINGS THAT HAVE NOT\r\nBEEN BORN THEMSELVES—ANIMALS WHICH ARE BORN THEMSELVES BUT ARE NOT\r\nREPRODUCTIVE—ANIMALS WHICH ARE OF NEITHER SEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome animals, again, are engendered of beings that are not engendered\r\nthemselves, and have no such origin as those above mentioned, which are\r\nproduced in the spring, or at some stated period of the year. Some of\r\nthese are non-productive, the salamander, for instance, which is of no\r\nsex, either male or female; a distinction also, which does not exist in\r\nthe eel and the other kinds that are neither viviparous nor oviparous.\r\nThe oyster also, as well as the other shell-fish that adhere to the\r\nbottom of the sea or to rocks, are of neither sex. Again, as to those\r\nanimals which are able to engender of themselves, if they are looked\r\nupon as divided into male and female, they do engender something, it is\r\ntrue, by coupling, but the produce is imperfect, quite dissimilar to\r\nthe animal itself, and one from which nothing else is reproduced; this\r\nwe find to be the case with flies, when they give birth to maggots.\r\nThis fact is better illustrated by the nature of those animals which\r\nare known as insects; a subject, indeed, very difficult of explanation,\r\nand one which requires to be treated of in a Book[3124] by itself. We\r\nwill, therefore, proceed for the present with our remarks upon the\r\ninstincts of the animals that have been previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 88. (69.)—THE SENSES OF ANIMALS—THAT ALL HAVE THE SENSES OF TOUCH\r\nAND TASTE—THOSE WHICH ARE MORE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR SIGHT, SMELL, OR\r\nHEARING—MOLES—WHETHER OYSTERS HAVE THE SENSE OF HEARING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan excels more especially in his sense of touch, and next, in that\r\nof taste. In other respects, he is surpassed by many of the animals.\r\nEagles can see more clearly than any other animals, while vultures\r\nhave the better smell; moles hear more distinctly than others,\r\nalthough buried in the earth, so dense and sluggish an element as\r\nit is; and what is even more, although every sound has a tendency\r\nupwards, they can hear the words that are spoken; and, it is said,\r\nthey can even understand it if you talk about them, and will take to\r\nflight immediately. Among men, a person who has not enjoyed the sense\r\nof hearing in his infancy, is deprived of the powers of speech as\r\nwell; and there are none deaf from their birth who are not dumb also.\r\nAmong the marine animals, it is not probable that oysters enjoy the\r\nsense of hearing, but it is said that immediately a noise is made the\r\nsolen[3125] will sink to the bottom; it is for this reason, too, that\r\nsilence is observed by persons while fishing at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 89. (70.)—WHICH FISHES HAVE THE BEST HEARING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFishes have neither organs of hearing, nor yet the exterior orifice.\r\nAnd yet, it is quite certain that they do hear; for it is a well-known\r\nfact, that in some fish-ponds they are in the habit of being assembled\r\nto be fed by the clapping of the hands. In the fish-ponds, too, that\r\nbelong to the Emperor, the fish are in the habit of coming, each\r\nkind as it bears its name.[3126] So too, it is said, the mullet, the\r\nwolf-fish, the salpa, and the chromis, have a very exquisite sense of\r\nhearing, and that it is for this reason that they frequent shallow\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 90.—WHICH FISHES HAVE THE FINEST SENSE OF SMELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite manifest that fishes have the sense of smell also; for they\r\nare not all to be taken with the same bait, and are seen to smell at\r\nit before they seize it. Some, too, that are concealed in the bottom\r\nof holes, are driven out by the fisherman, by the aid of the smell of\r\nsalted fish; with this he rubs the entrance of their retreat in the\r\nrock, immediately upon which they take to flight from the spot, just as\r\nthough they had recognized the dead carcases of those of their kind.\r\nThen, again, they will rise to the surface at the smell of certain\r\nodours, such, for instance as roasted sæpia and polypus; and hence it\r\nis that these baits are placed in the osier kipes used for taking fish.\r\nThey immediately take to flight upon smelling the bilge water in a\r\nship’s hold, and more especially upon scenting the blood of fish.\r\n\r\nThe polypus cannot possibly be torn away from the rock to which it\r\nclings; but upon the herb cunila[3127] being applied, the instant it\r\nsmells it the fish quits its hold. Purples also are taken by means of\r\nfetid substances. And then, too, as to the other kinds of animals,\r\nwho is there that can feel any doubt? Serpents are driven away by the\r\nsmell of harts’ horns, and more particularly by that of storax. Ants,\r\ntoo, are killed by the odours of origanum, lime, or sulphur. Gnats are\r\nattracted by acids, but not by anything sweet.\r\n\r\n(71.) All animals have the sense of touch, those even which have no\r\nother sense; for even in the oyster, and, among land animals, in the\r\nworm, this sense is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 91.—DIVERSITIES IN THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am strongly inclined to believe, too, that the sense of taste exists\r\nin all animals; for why else should one seek one kind of food, and\r\nanother another? And it is in this more especially that is to be seen\r\nthe wondrous power of Nature, the framer of all things. Some animals\r\nseize their prey with their teeth, others, again, with their claws;\r\nsome tear it to pieces with their hooked beak; others, that have a\r\nbroad bill, wabble in their food; others, with a sharp nib, work holes\r\ninto it; others suck at their food; others, again, lick it, others\r\nsup it in, others chew it, and others bolt it whole. And no less a\r\ndiversity is there in the uses they make of their feet, for the purpose\r\nof carrying, tearing asunder, holding, squeezing, suspending[3128]\r\ntheir bodies, or incessantly scratching the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 92. (72.)—ANIMALS WHICH LIVE ON POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoe-bucks and quails[3129] grow fat on poisons, as we have already\r\nmentioned, being themselves the most harmless of animals. Serpents\r\nwill feed on eggs, and the address displayed by the dragon is quite\r\nremarkable.—For it will either swallow the egg whole, if its jaws will\r\nallow of it, and roll over and over so as to break it within, and then\r\nby coughing eject the shells: or else, if it is too young to be able to\r\ndo so, it will gradually encircle the egg with its coils, and hold it\r\nso tight as to break it at the end, just, in fact, as though a piece\r\nhad been cut out with a knife; then holding the remaining part in its\r\nfolds, it will suck the contents. In the same manner, too, when it has\r\nswallowed a bird whole, it will make a violent effort, and vomit the\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 93.—ANIMALS WHICH LIVE ON EARTH—ANIMALS WHICH WILL NOT DIE OF\r\nHUNGER OR THIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nScorpions live on earth. Serpents, when an opportunity presents itself,\r\nshow an especial liking for wine, although in other respects they need\r\nbut very little drink. These animals, also, when kept shut up, require\r\nbut little aliment, hardly any at all, in fact. The same is the case\r\nalso with spiders, which at other times live by suction. Hence it is,\r\nthat no venomous animal will die of hunger or thirst; it being the fact\r\nthat they have neither heat, blood, nor sweat; all which humours, from\r\ntheir natural saltness, increase the animal’s voracity. In this class\r\nof animals all those are the most deadly, which have eaten some of\r\ntheir own kind just before they inflict the wound. The sphingium and\r\nthe satyr[3130] stow away food in the pouches of their cheeks, after\r\nwhich they will take it out piece by piece with their hands and eat it;\r\nand thus they do for a day or an hour what the ant usually does[3131]\r\nfor the whole year.\r\n\r\n(73.) The only animal with toes upon the feet that feeds upon grass is\r\nthe hare, which will eat corn as well; while the solid-hoofed animals,\r\nand the swine among the cloven-footed ones, will eat all kinds of\r\nfood, as well as roots. To roll over and over is a peculiarity of the\r\nanimals with a solid hoof. All those which have serrated teeth are\r\ncarnivorous. Bears live also upon corn, leaves, grapes, fruit, bees,\r\ncrabs even, and ants; wolves, as we have already[3132] stated, will eat\r\nearth even when they are famishing. Cattle grow fat by drinking; hence\r\nit is that salt agrees with them so well; the same is also the case\r\nwith beasts of burden, although they live on corn as well as grass; but\r\nthey eat just in proportion to what they drink. In addition to those\r\nalready spoken of, among the wild animals, stags ruminate, when reared\r\nin a domesticated state. All animals ruminate lying in preference to\r\nstanding, and more in winter than in summer, mostly for seven months\r\nin the year. The Pontic mouse[3133] also ruminates in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 94.—DIVERSITIES IN THE DRINKING OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn drinking, those animals which have serrated[3134] teeth, lap; and\r\ncommon mice do the same, although they belong to another class. Those\r\nwhich have the teeth continuous, horses and oxen, for instance, sup;\r\nbears do neither the one nor the other, but seem to bite at the water,\r\nand so devour it. In Africa, the greater part of the wild beasts do\r\nnot drink in summer, through the want of rain; for which reason it\r\nis that the mice of Libya, when caught, will die if they drink. The\r\never-thirsting plains of Africa produce the oryx,[3135] an animal\r\nwhich, in consequence of the nature of its native locality, never\r\ndrinks, and which, in a remarkable manner, affords a remedy against\r\ndrought: for the Gætulian bandits by its aid fortify themselves\r\nagainst thirst, by finding in its body certain vesicles filled with a\r\nmost wholesome liquid. In this same Africa, also, the pards conceal\r\nthemselves in the thick foliage of the trees, and then spring down from\r\nthe branches on any creature that may happen to be passing by, thus\r\noccupying what are ordinarily the haunts of the birds. Cats too, with\r\nwhat silent stealthiness, with what light steps do they creep towards\r\na bird! How slily they will sit and watch, and then dart out upon a\r\nmouse! These animals scratch up the earth and bury their ordure, being\r\nwell aware that the smell of it would betray their presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 95. (74.)—ANTIPATHIES OF ANIMALS. PROOFS THAT THEY ARE SENSIBLE\r\nOF FRIENDSHIP AND OTHER AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence there will be no difficulty in perceiving that animals are\r\npossessed of other instincts besides those previously mentioned. In\r\nfact, there are certain antipathies and sympathies among them, which\r\ngive rise to various affections besides those which we have mentioned\r\nin relation to each species in its appropriate place. The swan and the\r\neagle are always at variance, and the raven and the chloreus[3136]\r\nseek each other’s eggs by night. In a similar manner, also, the raven\r\nand the kite are perpetually at war with one another, the one carrying\r\noff the other’s food. So, too, there are antipathies between the crow\r\nand the owl, the eagle and the trochilus;[3137]—between the last two,\r\nif we are to believe the story, because the latter has received the\r\ntitle of the “king of the birds:” the same, again, with the owlet and\r\nall the smaller birds.\r\n\r\nAgain, in relation to the terrestrial animals, the weasel is at enmity\r\nwith the crow, the turtle-dove with the pyrallis,[3138] the ichneumon\r\nwith the wasp, and the phalangium with other spiders. Among aquatic\r\nanimals, there is enmity between the duck and the sea-mew, the falcon\r\nknown as the “harpe,” and the hawk called the “triorchis.” In a similar\r\nmanner, too, the shrew-mouse and the heron are ever on the watch for\r\neach other’s young; and the ægithus,[3139] so small a bird as it is,\r\nhas an antipathy to the ass; for the latter, when scratching itself,\r\nrubs its body against the brambles, and so crushes the bird’s nest;\r\na thing of which it stands in such dread, that if it only hears the\r\nvoice of the ass when it brays, it will throw its eggs out of the\r\nnest, and the young ones themselves will sometimes fall to the ground\r\nin their fright; hence it is that it will fly at the ass, and peck at\r\nits sores with its beak. The fox, too, is at war with the nisus,[3140]\r\nand serpents with weasels and swine. Æsalon[3141] is the name given\r\nto a small bird that breaks the eggs of the raven, and the young of\r\nwhich are anxiously sought by the fox; while in its turn it will peck\r\nat the young of the fox, and even the parent itself. As soon as the\r\nravens espy this, they come to its assistance, as though against a\r\ncommon enemy. The acanthis, too, lives among the brambles; hence it\r\nis that it also has an antipathy to the ass, because it devours the\r\nbramble blossoms. The ægithus and the anthus,[3142] too, are at such\r\nmortal enmity with each other, that it is the common belief that their\r\nblood will not mingle; and it is for this reason that they have the bad\r\nrepute of being employed in many magical incantations. The thos and\r\nthe lion are at war with each other; and, indeed, the smallest objects\r\nand the greatest just as much. Caterpillars will avoid a tree that is\r\ninfested with ants. The spider, poised in its web, will throw itself\r\non the head of a serpent as it lies stretched beneath the shade of the\r\ntree where it has built, and with its bite pierce its brain; such is\r\nthe shock, that the creature will hiss from time to time, and then,\r\nseized with vertigo, coil round and round, while it finds itself unable\r\nto take to flight, or so much as to break the web of the spider, as it\r\nhangs suspended above; this scene only ends with its death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 96.—INSTANCES OF AFFECTION SHOWN BY SERPENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a strict friendship existing between the\r\npeacock and the pigeon, the turtle-dove and the parrot, the blackbird\r\nand the turtle, the crow and the heron, all of which join in a common\r\nenmity against the fox. The harpe also, and the kite, unite against the\r\ntriorchis.\r\n\r\nAnd then, besides, have we not seen instances of affection in the\r\nserpent even, that most ferocious of all animals? We have already[3143]\r\nrelated the story that is told of a man in Arcadia, who was saved by a\r\ndragon which had belonged to him, and of his voice being recognized by\r\nthe animal. We must also make mention here of another marvellous story\r\nthat is related by Phylarchus about the asp. He tells us, that in Egypt\r\none of these animals, after having received its daily nourishment at\r\nthe table of a certain person, brought forth, and that it so happened\r\nthat the son of its entertainer was killed by one of its young ones;\r\nupon which, returning to its food as usual, and becoming sensible of\r\nthe crime, it immediately killed the young one, and returned to the\r\nhouse no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 97. (75.)—THE SLEEP OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question as to their sleep, is one that is by no means difficult\r\nto solve. In the land animals, it is quite evident that all that have\r\neyelids sleep. With reference to aquatic animals, it is admitted that\r\nthey also sleep, though only for short periods, even by those writers\r\nwho entertain doubts as to the other animals; and they come to this\r\nconclusion, not from any appearance of the eyes, for they have no\r\neyelids, indeed, to close, but because they are to be seen buried in\r\ndeep repose, and to all appearance fast asleep, betraying no motion in\r\nany part of the body except the tail, and by starting when they happen\r\nto hear a noise. With regard to the thunny, it is stated with still\r\ngreater confidence that it sleeps; indeed, it is often found in that\r\nstate near the shore, or among the rocks. Flat fish are also found fast\r\nasleep in shallow water, and are often taken in that state with the\r\nhand: and, as to the dolphin and the balæna, they are even heard to\r\nsnore.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident, also, that insects sleep, from the silent\r\nstillness which they preserve; and even if a light is put close to\r\nthem, they will not be awoke thereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 98.—WHAT ANIMALS ARE SUBJECT TO DREAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan, just after his birth, is hard pressed by sleep for several months,\r\nafter which he becomes more and more wakeful, day by day. The infant\r\ndreams[3144] from the very first, for it will suddenly awake with every\r\nsymptom of alarm, and while asleep will imitate the action of sucking.\r\nThere are some persons, however, who never dream; indeed, we find\r\ninstances stated where it has been a fatal sign for a person to dream,\r\nwho has never done so before. Here we find ourselves invited by a grand\r\nfield of investigation, and one that is full of alleged proofs on both\r\nsides of the question, whether, when the mind is at rest in sleep, it\r\nhas any foreknowledge of the future, and if so, by what process this\r\nis brought about, or whether this is not altogether a matter quite\r\nfortuitous, as most other things are? If we were to attempt to decide\r\nthe question by instances quoted, we should find as many on the one\r\nside as on the other.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty generally agreed, that dreams, immediately after we have\r\ntaken wine and food, or when we have just fallen asleep again after\r\nwaking, have no signification whatever. Indeed, sleep is nothing else\r\nthan the retiring[3145] of the mind into itself. It is quite evident\r\nthat, besides man, horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, and goats have dreams;\r\nconsequently, the same is supposed to be the case with all animals that\r\nare viviparous. As to those which are oviparous, it is a matter of\r\nuncertainty, though it is equally certain that they do sleep.

The\r\nCimmerian Bosporus not improbably borrowed its name from the Thracian.\r\nSee Æsch. Prom. Vinc. l. 733.\r\n\r\n[7] This sentence seems to bear reference to the one that follows, and\r\nnot, as punctuated in the Latin, to the one immediately preceding it.\r\n\r\n[8] It is not probable that this is the case at the Straits of Kaffa,\r\nwhich are nearly four miles in width at the narrowest part.\r\n\r\n[9] Now the Riva, a river of Bithynia, in Asia Minor, falling into the\r\nEuxine north-east of Chalcedon.\r\n\r\n[10] Probably an obscure town.\r\n\r\n[11] On the river Calpas or Calpe, in Bithynia. Xenophon, in the\r\nAnabasis, describes it as about half way between Byzantium and\r\nHeraclea. The spot is identified in some of the maps as Kirpeh Limán,\r\nand the promontory as Cape Kirpeh.\r\n\r\n[12] Still known as the Sakaria.\r\n\r\n[13] Now called the Sursak, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[14] Now the Lef-ke. See the end of c. 42 of the last Book.\r\n\r\n[15] The modern Gulf of Sakaria. Of the Mariandyni, who gave the\r\nancient name to it, little or nothing is known.\r\n\r\n[16] Its site is now known as Harakli or Eregli. By Strabo it is\r\nerroneously called a colony of Miletus. It was situate a few miles to\r\nthe north of the river Lycus.\r\n\r\n[17] Now called the Kilij.\r\n\r\n[18] Stephanus Byzantinus speaks of this place as producing whetstones,\r\nor ἀκοναὶ, as well as the plant aconite.\r\n\r\n[19] This name was given to the cavern in common with several other\r\nlakes or caverns in various parts of the world, which, like the various\r\nrivers of the name of Acheron, were at some time supposed to be\r\nconnected with the lower world.\r\n\r\n[20] Now called Falios (or more properly Filiyos), according to\r\nD’Anville, from the river of that name in its vicinity, supposed by\r\nhim and other geographers to be the same as the ancient Billis, here\r\nmentioned by Pliny. By others of the ancient writers it is called\r\nBillæus.\r\n\r\n[21] Paphlagonia was bounded by Bithynia on the west, and by Pontus\r\non the east, being separated from the last by the river Halys; on the\r\nsouth it was divided by the chain of Mount Olympus from Phrygia in the\r\nearlier times, from Galatia at a later period; and on the north it\r\nbordered on the Euxine.\r\n\r\n[22] In the Homeric catalogue we find Pylæmenes leading the\r\nPaphlagonians as allies of the Trojans; from this Pylæmenes the later\r\nprinces of Paphlagonia claimed their descent, and the country was\r\nsometimes from them called Pylæmenia.\r\n\r\n[23] Suspected by Hardouin to have been the same as the Moson or Moston\r\nmentioned by Ptolemy as in Galatia.\r\n\r\n[24] It is mentioned by Homer, Il. ii. 855, as situate on the coast of\r\nPaphlagonia.\r\n\r\n[25] Strabo also, in B. xii., says that these people afterwards\r\nestablished themselves in Thrace, and that gradually moving to the\r\nwest, they finally settled in the Italian Venetia, which from them\r\ntook its name. But in his Fourth Book he says that the Veneti of Italy\r\nowe their origin to the Gallic Veneti, who came from the neighbourhood\r\nknown as the modern Vannes.\r\n\r\n[26] This city, ninety stadia east of the river Parthenius, occupied a\r\npeninsula, and on each side of the isthmus was a harbour. The original\r\ncity, as here mentioned, seems to have had the name of Sesamus or\r\nSesamum, and it is spoken of by that name in Homer, Il. ii. 853, in\r\nconjunction with Cytorus. The territory of Amastris was famous for its\r\ngrowth of the best box-wood, which grew on Mount Cytorus. The present\r\nAmasra or Hanasserah occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[27] See the last Note.\r\n\r\n[28] Otherwise called “Cinolis.” There is a place called Kinla or\r\nKinoglu in the maps, about half-way between Kerempeh and Sinope, which\r\nis the Kinuli of Abulfeda, and probably the Cirolis or Cimolis of the\r\nGreek geographers.\r\n\r\n[29] The modern Estefan or Stefanos.\r\n\r\n[30] Now known by the name of Bartin, a corruption of its ancient\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\n[31] It still retains its ancient appellation in its name of Cape\r\nKerempeh: of the ancient town nothing is known.\r\n\r\n[32] Now called Sinope, or Sinoub. Some ruins of it are still to be\r\nseen. The modern town is but a poor place, and has probably greatly\r\ndeclined since the recent attack upon it by the Russian fleet.\r\nDiogenes, the Cynic philosopher, was a native of ancient Sinope.\r\n\r\n[33] The boundary, according to Stephanus Byzantinus, also of the\r\nnations of Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. As Parisot remarks, this is an\r\nerror, arising from the circumstance of a small tribe bearing the name\r\nof Cappadocians, having settled on its banks, between whom and the\r\nPaphlagonians it served as a limit.\r\n\r\n[34] On the river Iris. It was the ancient residence of the kings of\r\nPontus, but in Strabo’s time it was deserted. It has been suggested\r\nthat the modern Azurnis occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[35] In the north-west of Pontus, in a fertile plain between the rivers\r\nHalys and Amisus. It is also called Gadilon by Strabo. D’Anville makes\r\nit the modern Aladgiam; while he calls Gaziura by the name of Guedes.\r\n\r\n[36] Now called the Kisil Irmak, or Red River. It has been remarked\r\nthat Pliny, in making this river to come down from Mount Taurus and\r\nflow at once from south to north, appears to confound the Halys with\r\none of its tributaries, now known as the Izchel Irmak.\r\n\r\n[37] Its site is now called Kiengareh, Kangreh, or Changeri. This was\r\na town of Paphlagonia, to the south of Mount Olgasys, at a distance of\r\nthirty-five miles from Pompeiopolis.\r\n\r\n[38] A commercial place to the south of Sinope. Its site is the modern\r\nGherseh on the coast.\r\n\r\n[39] Now called Eski Samsun; on the west side of the bay or gulf,\r\nanciently called Sinus Amisenus. According to Strabo, it was only 900\r\nstadia from Sinope, or 112-1/2 Roman miles. The walls of the ancient\r\ncity are to be seen on a promontory about a mile and a half from the\r\nmodern town.\r\n\r\n[40] He means the numerous indentations which run southward into the\r\ncoast, from the headland of Sinope to a distance of about one degree to\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n[41] On examining the map, we shall find that the distance is at least\r\n300 miles across to the gulf of Issus or Iskenderoon.\r\n\r\n[42] Not speaking the Greek language.\r\n\r\n[43] A part of it only was added to Eupatoria; and it was separated\r\nfrom the rest by a wall, and probably contained a different population\r\nfrom that of Amisus. This new quarter contained the residence of the\r\nking, Mithridates Eupator, who built Eupatoria.\r\n\r\n[44] The boundaries of Cappadocia varied under the dominion of the\r\nPersians, after the Macedonian conquest, and as a Roman province under\r\nthe emperors.\r\n\r\n[45] Founded by Archelaüs, the last king of Cappadocia. In Hamilton’s\r\n_Researches_, the site has been assumed to be the modern Ak-serai,\r\nbut that place is not on the river Halys, as Leake supposes. It is,\r\nhowever, considered that Ak-serai agrees very well with the position of\r\nArchelais as laid down in the Itineraries, and that Pliny may have been\r\nmisled in supposing that the stream on which it stood was the Halys.\r\n\r\n[46] Also called by the name of Chryse, or “Golden,” to distinguish it\r\nfrom another place of the same name in Pontus. It is generally supposed\r\nthat the town of Al-Bostan, on the Sihoon or Sarus, is on or near the\r\nsite of this Comana.\r\n\r\n[47] Now called Niksar, according to D’Anville, though Hardouin says\r\nthat it is Tocat. Parisot remarks, that this place belonged rather to\r\nPontus than to Cappadocia.\r\n\r\n[48] A small tributary of the Iris, or Yeshil-Irmak, mentioned in the\r\nnext Chapter.\r\n\r\n[49] Still called Amasia, or Amasiyeh, and situate on the river Iris,\r\nor Yeshil Ermak. It was at one time the residence of the princes of\r\nPontus, and the birth-place of the geographer Strabo. The remains of\r\nantiquity here are very considerable, and extremely interesting.\r\n\r\n[50] Both to the west of Neo-Cæsarea. According to Tavernier, as quoted\r\nby Hardouin, the modern name of Sebastia is Sivas.\r\n\r\n[51] Which gave name to the district of Melitene, mentioned in c. 20 of\r\nthe last Book.\r\n\r\n[52] Near Nazianzus, in Cappadocia, the birth-place of Gregory\r\nNazianzen. The traveller Ainsworth, on his road from Ak-Serai to Kara\r\nHissar, came to a place called Kaisar Koi, and he has remarked that\r\nby its name and position it might be identified with Diocæsarea. Some\r\ngeographers, indeed, look upon Diocæsarea and Nazianzus as the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[53] Its ruins are still to be seen at Kiz Hisar. It stood in the south\r\nof Cappadocia, at the northern foot of Mount Taurus. Tyana was the\r\nnative place of Apollonius, the supposed worker of miracles, whom the\r\nenemies of Christianity have not scrupled to place on a par with Jesus\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n[54] Some ruins, nineteen geographical miles from Ayas, are supposed to\r\ndenote the site of ancient Castabala or Castabulum.\r\n\r\n[55] This place was first called Eupatoria, but not the same which\r\nMithridates united with a part of Amisus. D’Anville supposes that the\r\nmodern town of Tchenikeb occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[56] Or Ziela, now known as Zillah, not far south of Amasia. It was\r\nhere that Julius Cæsar conquered Pharnaces, on the occasion on which he\r\nwrote his dispatch to Rome, “Veni, vidi, vici.”\r\n\r\n[57] Still known by the name of Ardgeh-Dagh.\r\n\r\n[58] Its site is still called Kaisiriyeh. It was a city of the district\r\nCilicia, in Cappadocia, at the base of the mountain Argæus. It was\r\nfirst called Mazaca, and after that, Eusebeia. There are considerable\r\nremains of the ancient city.\r\n\r\n[59] Hardouin remarks, that the district of Sargarausene was not\r\nsituate in front of Phrygia, but lay between Morimene and Colopenene,\r\nin the vicinity of Pontus.\r\n\r\n[60] Now known as the Konax, a tributary of the Halys, rising in Mount\r\nLittarus, in the chain of Paryadres.\r\n\r\n[61] Or “White Syrians.” Strabo says that in his time both the\r\nCappadocian peoples, those situate above the Taurus and those on the\r\nEuxine, were called Leucosyri, or _White_ Syrians, as there were some\r\nSyrians who were black, and who dwelt to the east of the Amanus.\r\n\r\n[62] It is doubtful whether this is the name of a river or a town.\r\nNotwithstanding its alleged celebrity, nothing is known of it.\r\n\r\n[63] Hecatæus, as quoted by Stephanus Byzantinus, speaks of Chadisia\r\nas a city of the Leucosyri, or Cappadocians. Neither the river nor the\r\ntown appears to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[64] Probably on the river of that name, which has been identified with\r\nthe Mers Imak, a river two or three miles east of the Acropolis of\r\nAmisus.\r\n\r\n[65] The extensive plain on the coast of Pontus, extending east of\r\nthe river Iris beyond the Thermodon, and celebrated as the country\r\nof the Amazons. At the mouth of the Thermodon was a city of the same\r\nname, which had been destroyed by the time of Augustus. It is doubtful\r\nwhether the modern Thermeh occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[66] The same place apparently as is mentioned in the last Chapter\r\nunder the name of Zela.\r\n\r\n[67] Valerius Triarius, one of the legates of Lucullus, in the war\r\nagainst Mithridates. Plutarch tells us that Lucullus was obliged to\r\nconceal Triarius from the fury of his troops.\r\n\r\n[68] Over Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates.\r\n\r\n[69] Now called the Thermea.\r\n\r\n[70] Still called Mason-Dagh.\r\n\r\n[71] He alludes to Comana, in Pontus, the site of which is now called\r\nGumenek, near to which, on the Tocat-su, the modern name of the Iris,\r\nHamilton found some remains of a Roman town, and part of a bridge\r\napparently of Roman construction. The language of Pliny seems to imply\r\nthat it had become in his day nothing beyond a _manteium_ or seat of an\r\noracle.\r\n\r\n[72] Strabo speaks of a promontory called Genetes; and Stephanus\r\nByzantinus mentions a river and port of the same name.\r\n\r\n[73] Strabo places the Chaldei, who, he says, were originally called\r\nChalybes, in that part of the country which lies above Pharnacia (the\r\nmodern Kerasunt).\r\n\r\n[74] Or Cotyora. According to Xenophon, this was a colony of Sinope\r\nwhich furnished supplies for the Ten Thousand in their retreat.\r\nThe place was on a bay called after the town. Hamilton, in his\r\n_Researches_, &c., Vol. i., is of opinion that Cotyorum may have stood\r\non the site of Ordou, where some remains of an ancient port, cut out\r\nof the solid rock are still visible. He remarks, however, that some\r\nwriters suppose that Cotyora was the modern bay of Pershembah, which is\r\nmore sheltered than Ordou. Cotyora was the place of embarkation of the\r\nTen Thousand.\r\n\r\n[75] Similar to what we call tatooing. Parisot suggests that these\r\npeople may have been the ancestors of the Mongol tribes who still dwell\r\nin tents similar to those mentioned by Mela as used by the Mossyni.\r\n\r\n[76] Or the “long-headed people.”\r\n\r\n[77] Its site is not improbably that of the modern Kheresoun, on the\r\ncoast of Asia Minor, and west of Trebizond. Lucullus is said to have\r\nbrought thence the first cherry-trees planted in Europe.\r\n\r\n[78] It has been remarked, that Pliny’s enumeration of names often\r\nrather confuses than helps, and that it is difficult to say where he\r\nintends to place the Bechires. We may perhaps infer from Mela that they\r\nwere west of Trapezus and east of the Thermodon.\r\n\r\n[79] Now the Kara Su, or Black River, still retaining its ancient\r\nappellation. It rises in Cappadocia, in the chain of Mount Argæus.\r\n\r\n[80] Still called by the same name, according to Parisot, though\r\nsometimes it is called the river of Vatisa. More recent authorities,\r\nhowever, call it Poleman Chai.\r\n\r\n[81] On the coast of Pontus, built by king Polemon, perhaps the Second,\r\non the site of the older city of Side, at the mouth of the Sidenus.\r\n\r\n[82] Probably near the promontory of Jasonium, 130 stadia to the\r\nnorth-east of Polemonium. It was believed to have received its name\r\nfrom Jason the Argonaut having landed there. It still bears the name of\r\nJasoon, though more commonly called Bona or Vona.\r\n\r\n[83] Sixty stadia, according to Arrian, from the town of Cotyora.\r\n\r\n[84] Supposed to have stood on almost the same site as the modern\r\nKheresoun or Kerasunda. It was built near, or, as some think, on the\r\nsite of Cerasus.\r\n\r\n[85] Still known by the name of Tireboli, on a river of the same name,\r\nthe Tireboli Su.\r\n\r\n[86] Now called Tarabosan, Trabezun, or Trebizond. This place was\r\noriginally a colony of Sinope, after the loss of whose independence\r\nTrapezus belonged, first to Lesser Armenia, and afterwards to the\r\nkingdom of Pontus. In the middle ages it was the seat of the so-called\r\nempire of Trebizond. It is now the second commercial port of the Black\r\nSea, ranking next after Odessa.\r\n\r\n[87] The “Chalybes of Armenia.” See p. 21.\r\n\r\n[88] Theodoret says that the Sanni, and the Lazi, subsequently\r\nmentioned, although subdued by the Roman arms, were never obedient to\r\nthe Roman laws. The Heniochi were probably of Grecian origin, as they\r\nwere said to have been descended from the charioteers of the Argonauts,\r\nwho had been wrecked upon these coasts.\r\n\r\n[89] Or Apsarus, or Absarum. Several geographers have placed the\r\nsite of this town near the modern one known as Gonieh. Its name was\r\nconnected with the myth of Medea and her brother Absyrtus. It is not\r\nimprobable that the names Acampsis and Absarus have been given to the\r\nsame river by different writers, and that they both apply to the modern\r\nJoruk.\r\n\r\n[90] It is suggested by Hardouin that these are the same as the Zydretæ\r\nmentioned in the Periplus of Arrian, and by him placed between the\r\nHeniochi and the Lazi.\r\n\r\n[91] See note [89].\r\n\r\n[92] Supposed to be the same as the modern Tshorok.\r\n\r\n[93] Or “Deep” River. This stream may possibly be identified by\r\nobserving that Pliny places only one river between it and the Phasis.\r\n\r\n[94] Probably the Madia of Ptolemy, who places it in the interior.\r\n\r\n[95] At the present day called Eraklia, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[96] Now called the Faz or Rhioni.\r\n\r\n[97] Still called El Faz or Poti.\r\n\r\n[98] This place was in reality thirty-seven miles and a half from the\r\nsea. It was said to have been the native place of the enchantresses\r\nCirce and Medea.\r\n\r\n[99] The rivers Hippos and Cyaneos do not appear to have been\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n[100] In the previous page.\r\n\r\n[101] Now called the Tchorocsu.\r\n\r\n[102] It is doubtful whether this is the same river as that mentioned\r\nby Strabo under the name of Chares. D’Anville says that its modern name\r\nis Enguri.\r\n\r\n[103] Or “Feeders on Lice;” so called, according to Strabo, from the\r\nextreme filthiness of their habits.\r\n\r\n[104] There is a nation in this vicinity still called by a similar\r\nname. Professor Pallas, who visited them, says that nothing can equal\r\ntheir dishonesty, rapacity, and voracity. Parisot suggests that they\r\nare probably the descendants of the Phthirophagi of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[105] Now called the Khalira, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[106] Now called the Hati-Scari, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[107] Now the Okhum, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[108] Now the Mosti-Skari, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[109] Still called Savastopoli, according to Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[110] This must not be confounded with the other place of the same name\r\nmentioned in the present Chapter. See p. 10.\r\n\r\n[111] Hermoläus suggests Pityus as the correct reading.\r\n\r\n[112] The Sanni Heniochi; one of these nations has been already\r\nmentioned in the last page.\r\n\r\n[113] Inhabited anciently by the Coli, and constituting the northern\r\nportion of ancient Colchis.\r\n\r\n[114] In B. v. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[115] Or nation “with the black cloaks,” from some peculiarity in their\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n[116] This was the great trading-place of the wild tribes in the\r\ninterior; and so numerous were they, that the Greeks asserted that\r\nthere were seventy different languages spoken in the market of\r\nDioscurias.\r\n\r\n[117] Whence the appellation _Heniochi_, from the Greek ἡνιοχὸς.\r\n\r\n[118] There were two places called Heracleium on this coast, one north\r\nand the other south of the river Achæus: probably the latter is here\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n[119] Said to have been descended from the Achæans or Greeks who\r\naccompanied Jason in the Argonautic Expedition, or, according to\r\nAmmianus, who resorted thither after the conclusion of the Trojan war.\r\n\r\n[120] Probably meaning the “martial people,” or the “people of Mars.”\r\nThis was the title, not of a single nation, but of a number of peoples\r\ndistinguished for their predatory habits.\r\n\r\n[121] This people occupied the N.E. shore of the Euxine, between the\r\nCimmerian Bosporus and the frontier of Colchis. Their name is still\r\nin existence, and is applied to the whole western district of the\r\nCaucasus, in the forms of Tcherkas, as applied to the people, and\r\nTcherkeskaia or Circassia, to the country.\r\n\r\n[122] Hardouin suggests that these ought to be read as forming one\r\nname, the “Cerri Cephalatomi,” and suggests that they were so called\r\nfrom their habit of cutting off the heads of their slain enemies.\r\n\r\n[123] Meaning, nearly in the extreme corner of Pontus.\r\n\r\n[124] In the time of Strabo this was a considerable sea-port, and after\r\nits destruction by the Heniochi, it was restored, and served as an\r\nimportant frontier fortress of the Roman empire against the Scythians.\r\n\r\n[125] This was Mithridates, king of Bosporus, which sovereignty he\r\nobtained by the favour of the emperor Claudius, in A.D. 41. The\r\ncircumstances are unknown which led to his subsequent expulsion by the\r\nRomans, who placed his younger brother Cotys on the throne in his stead.\r\n\r\n[126] Hardouin thinks that the Thalli inhabited the present country of\r\nAstrakan.\r\n\r\n[127] It was the ancient opinion, to which we shall find frequent\r\nreference made in the present Book, that the northern portion of the\r\nCaspian communicated with the Scythian or Septentrional ocean.\r\n\r\n[128] Mentioned only by Pliny. It is supposed to answer to the present\r\nUkrash river; and the town and river of Hierus are probably identical\r\nwith the Hieros Portus of Arrian, which has been identified with the\r\nmodern Sunjuk-Kala.\r\n\r\n[129] Inhabited by the Sindi, a people of Asiatic Sarmatia. They\r\nprobably dwelt in and about the modern peninsula of Taman, between the\r\nSea of Azof and the Black Sea, to the south of the river Hypanis, the\r\nmodern Kouban. The site of their capital, Sindos, or Sinda, is supposed\r\nto have been the modern Anapa. Parisot conjectures that this place was\r\none of the ancient settlements of the Zigeunes, the modern Bohemians or\r\nGypsies. He seems to found his opinion upon some observations of Malte\r\nBrun (_Précis de Geographie_, vol. vi.) upon the origin of the Gypsy\r\nrace, which will amply repay the perusal.\r\n\r\n[130] The peninsula on which Taman or Timoutarakan is situate.\r\n\r\n[131] The _jugerum_ was 100 Grecian or 104 Roman feet in length.\r\n\r\n[132] Signifying in Greek the “sea-shore.”\r\n\r\n[133] Lying between Singa and Phanagoria. Rennell fixes it at the\r\nopening of the lake into which the Kouban flows.\r\n\r\n[134] Or the “gardens,” from the Greek κῆποι. A town of the Cimmerian\r\nBosporus, founded by the Milesians. Dr. Clarke identifies the modern\r\nSienna with it, and the curious Milesian sculptures found there confirm\r\nthe supposition.\r\n\r\n[135] Its ruins are supposed to be those near Taman, on the eastern\r\nside of the Straits of Kaffa. It was the great emporium for all the\r\ntraffic between the coasts of the Palus Mæotis and the countries on the\r\nsouth of the Caucasus, and was chosen by the kings of Bosporus as their\r\ncapital in Asia.\r\n\r\n[136] A town of the Sindæ; it possessed, like Phanagoria, a celebrated\r\ntemple of Aphrodite Apaturos, or Venus “the Deceiver,” whence probably\r\nits name.\r\n\r\n[137] Clarke identifies it with the modern Temruk, but Forbiger with\r\nEskikrimm.\r\n\r\n[138] See B. iv. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[139] That lying on the east of the Sea of Azof. It seems impossible to\r\nidentify the spot inhabited by each of these savage tribes. Hardouin\r\nsays that the modern name of that inhabited by the Mæotici is Coumania.\r\n\r\n[140] Parisot suggests that this tribe afterwards emigrated to the\r\nwest, and after establishing themselves in Macedonia, finally gave its\r\nname to modern Servia. He remarks, that most of these names appear to\r\nhave been greatly mutilated, through the ignorance or carelessness of\r\nthe transcribers, no two of the manuscripts agreeing as to the mode in\r\nwhich they should be spelt.\r\n\r\n[141] Or Don. It flows into the Sea of Azof by two larger mouths and\r\nseveral smaller ones. Strabo says that the distance between the two\r\nlarger mouths is sixty stadia.\r\n\r\n[142] From the Greek γυναικοκρατουμενοὶ, “ruled over by women.” It is\r\nnot improbable that this name was given by some geographer to these\r\nSarmatian tribes on finding them, at the period of his visit, in\r\nsubjection to the rule of a queen. Parisot remarks, that this passage\r\naffords an instance of the little care bestowed by Pliny upon procuring\r\nthe best and most correct information, for that the Roman writers had\r\nlong repudiated the use of the term “Sauromatæ.” He also takes Pliny to\r\ntask for his allusion to these tribes as coupling with the Amazons, the\r\nexistence of such a people being in his time generally disbelieved.\r\n\r\n[143] Hardouin suggests from εὐάζω, “to celebrate the orgies of\r\nBacchus.”\r\n\r\n[144] Perhaps from κοίτη, a “den” or “cavern,” their habitation.\r\n\r\n[145] Parisot suggests that they may have been a Caucasian or\r\nCircassian tribe, because in the Circassian language the word _zig_\r\nhas the meaning of “man.” He also suggests that they were probably a\r\ndistinct race from the Zingi previously mentioned, whom he identifies\r\nwith the ancestors of the Zingari or Bohemians, the modern Gypsies.\r\n\r\n[146] The more common reading is “Turcæ,” a tribe also mentioned by\r\nMela, and which gave name to modern Turkistan.\r\n\r\n[147] The Argippæi of Herodotus and other ancient authors. These people\r\nwere bald, flat-nosed, and long-chinned. They are again mentioned\r\nby Pliny in C. 14, who calls them a race not unlike the Hyperborei,\r\nand then, like Mela, abridges the description given by Herodotus. By\r\ndifferent writers these people have been identified with the Chinese,\r\nthe Brahmins or Lamas, and the Calmucks. The last is thought to be\r\nthe most probable opinion, or else that the description of Herodotus,\r\nborrowed by other writers, may be applied to the Mongols in general.\r\nThe mountains, at the foot of which they have been placed, are\r\nidentified with either the Ural, the western extremity of the Altaï\r\nchain, or the eastern part of the Altaï.\r\n\r\n[148] Generally regarded as the western branch of the Ural Mountains.\r\n\r\n[149] The former editions mostly have “there _was_,” implying that in\r\nthe time of Pliny it no longer existed. The name of this place was\r\nTanais; its ruins are still to be seen in the vicinity of Kassatchei.\r\nIt was founded by a colony from Miletus, and became a flourishing seat\r\nof trade. The modern town of Azof is supposed to occupy nearly its site.\r\n\r\n[150] The people of Panticapæum, on the opposite side of the Palus\r\nMæotis, occupying the site of the present Kertch. It was founded by\r\nthe Milesians B.C. 541, and took its name from the neighbouring river\r\nPanticapes.\r\n\r\n[151] The Ceraunian mountains were a range belonging to the Caucasian\r\nchain, and situate at its eastern extremity; the relation of this range\r\nto the chain has been variously stated by the different writers.\r\n\r\n[152] He may possibly allude to a range of mountains in the Punjaub and\r\nthe vicinity of the modern Lahore, by his reference to the Cathæi, who\r\nare supposed to have been the ancient inhabitants of that district. The\r\nlocalities of the various races here mentioned are involved in great\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\n[153] Or Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[154] See Vol. i. p. 497.\r\n\r\n[155] He includes under the term “Cappadocia,” the northern part\r\noriginally called “Cappadocia ad Pontum,” and in later times simply\r\nPontus, and the southern part, originally called “Cappadocia ad\r\nTaurum,” and more recently simply Cappadocia.\r\n\r\n[156] Running from the shores of the Euxine to the borders of Syria.\r\n\r\n[157] _I. e._ on the eastern side.\r\n\r\n[158] Meaning that part of Asia which we now call Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[159] This ill agrees with what he has said in c. 2, that the distance\r\nacross from Sinope to the Gulf of Issus is but 200 miles.\r\n\r\n[160] Greater Armenia, now known as Erzeroum, Kars, Van, and Erivan,\r\nwas bounded on the north-east and north by the river Cyrus, or Kur of\r\nthe present day; on the north-west and west by the Moschian mountains,\r\nthe prolongation of the chain of the Anti-Taurus, and the Euphrates,\r\nor Frat of the present day; and on the south and south-east by the\r\nmountains called Masius, Niphates, and Gordiæi (the prolongation of the\r\nTaurus), and the lower course of the Araxes. On the east the country\r\ncomes to a point at the confluence of the Syrus and Araxes.\r\n\r\n[161] Now known as the Kara-bel-Dagh, or Kut-Tagh, a mountain chain\r\nrunning south-west and north-east from the east of Asia Minor into the\r\ncentre of Armenia, and forming the chief connecting link between the\r\nTaurus and the mountains of Armenia.\r\n\r\n[162] In B. v. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[163] He means, where the river Euphrates runs the farthest to the west.\r\n\r\n[164] Littré suggests that the reading should be “Aroei.”\r\n\r\n[165] The modern Eraskh or Aras.\r\n\r\n[166] The modern Kur.\r\n\r\n[167] This district was bounded on the east by the Euphrates, on\r\nthe north and north-west by the mountains Scodises, Paryadres, and\r\nAnti-Taurus, and on the south by the Taurus.\r\n\r\n[168] This river is said by Ammianus to have taken its name from Cyrus.\r\nIt appears, however, to have been a not uncommon name of the rivers of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\n[169] It is probable that these rivers take their rise near each other,\r\nbut it is not improbable that the intervening distance mentioned in the\r\npresent passage is much too small.\r\n\r\n[170] Hardouin thinks that this is Neo-Cæsarea, mentioned as having\r\nbeen built on the banks of the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[171] Now called Ezaz, according to D’Anville. Parisot suggests that\r\nit ought to be Gaza or Gazaca, probably a colony of Median Gaza, now\r\nTauris.\r\n\r\n[172] Originally called Tephrice. It stood on the river Lycus, and not\r\nfar from the sources of the Halys, having been founded by Pompey, where\r\nhe gained his first victory over Mithridates, whence its name, the\r\n“City of Victory.” The modern Enderez or Devrigni, probably marks its\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n[173] Ritter places it in Sophene, the modern Kharpat, and considers\r\nthat it may be represented by the modern Sert, the Tigranocerta of\r\nD’Anville.\r\n\r\n[174] The capital of Sophene, one of the districts of Armenia. St.\r\nMartin thinks that this was the ancient heathen name of the city of\r\nMartyropolis, but Ritter shows that such cannot be the case. It was\r\ncalled by the Syrians Kortbest; its present name is Kharput.\r\n\r\n[175] Generally supposed, by D’Anville and other modern geographers, to\r\nbe represented by the ruins seen at Sert. It was the later capital of\r\nArmenia, built by Tigranes.\r\n\r\n[176] The ancient capital of Armenia. Hannibal, who took refuge at\r\nthe court of Artaxias when Antiochus was no longer able to afford\r\nhim protection, superintended the building of it. Some ruins, called\r\nTakt Tiridate, or Throne of Tiridates, near the junction of the Aras\r\nand the Zengue, were formerly supposed to represent Artaxata, but\r\nColonel Monteith has fixed the site at a bend in the river lower down,\r\nat the bottom of which were the ruins of a bridge of Greek or Roman\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n[177] A fortress in Lesser Armenia, upon the Euphrates, seventy-five\r\nmiles from Zimara, as mentioned in B. v. c. 20. It has been identified\r\nwith the modern ferry and lead mines of Kebban Ma’den, the points where\r\nthe Kara Su is joined by the Murad Chaï, 270 miles from its source.\r\n\r\n[178] Justin makes it only 1100, and that estimate appears to be\r\nseveral hundreds too much.\r\n\r\n[179] A country lying to the north of Armenia.\r\n\r\n[180] We find in Strabo the names of some of them mentioned, such\r\nas Sophene, Acilisene, Gorgodylene, Sacassene, Gorgarene, Phanene,\r\nComisene Orchestene, Chorsene, Cambysene, Odomantis, &c.\r\n\r\n[181] The Ceraunian Mountains. Parisot remarks that in this\r\ndescription, Pliny, notwithstanding his previous professions, does not\r\nappear to have made any very great use of the list drawn up by Corbulo.\r\n\r\n[182] That is, looking towards the south.\r\n\r\n[183] The Septentrional Ocean, with which the ancients imagined that\r\nthe northern part of the Caspian Sea is connected. See c. 15.\r\n\r\n[184] According to Strabo, Albania was bounded on the east by the\r\nCaspian, and on the north by the Caucasus. On the west it joined\r\nIberia, while on the south it was divided from the Greater Armenia by\r\nthe river Cyrus. By later writers, the northern and western boundaries\r\nare differently given. It was found to be the fact that the Albani\r\noccupied the country on both sides of the Caucasus, and accordingly\r\nPliny, in c. 15, carries the country further north, as far as the river\r\nCasius, while in this Chapter he makes the river Alazon, the modern\r\nAlasan, the western boundary towards Iberia.\r\n\r\n[185] To the west of Albania.\r\n\r\n[186] Iberia lay south of the great chain of the Caucasus, forming\r\nan extensive tract bounded on the west by Colchis, on the east by\r\nAlbania, and on the south by Armenia, and watered by the river Cyrus.\r\nIt corresponded very nearly with modern Georgia.\r\n\r\n[187] The modern Alasan.\r\n\r\n[188] Now called Kablas-Var, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[189] Parisot says that this can be no other than Harmoza on the river\r\nCyrus, in the vicinity of the modern Akhalzik.\r\n\r\n[190] Probably meaning “of the same name.”\r\n\r\n[191] To the west.\r\n\r\n[192] “The Armenian workers in iron,” or “Chalybes of Armenia.” See p.\r\n9.\r\n\r\n[193] There are two chief passes over the chain of the Caucasus, both\r\nof which were known to the ancients. The first is between the eastern\r\nextremity of its chief north-eastern spur and the Caspian sea, near\r\nthe modern Derbend. This was called “Albaniæ,” and sometimes, “Caspiæ\r\nPylæ,” the “Albanian” or “Caspian Gates.” The other, which was nearly\r\nin the centre of the Caspian range, was called “Caucasiæ” or “Sarmaticæ\r\nPylæ,” being the same as the modern pass of Dariyel, and probably the\r\none here referred to.\r\n\r\n[194] Probably the same as the present fortress of Dariyel.\r\n\r\n[195] The first instance was that of the narrow isthmus to which the\r\ncontinent of Asia is reduced from Sinope across to the Gulf of Issus,\r\nas mentioned in c. 2.\r\n\r\n[196] The shortest distance across, in a straight line, is in reality\r\nlittle less than 600 miles.\r\n\r\n[197] The ancestor of the Seleucidæ, kings of Syria, treacherously\r\nslain by Ptolemy Ceraunus, brother of Ptolemy Philadelphus.\r\n\r\n[198] Already mentioned in B. iv. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[199] Mentioned in c. 44 of the last Book.\r\n\r\n[200] The one lying at the mouth of the Danube, and mentioned in B. iv.\r\nc. 27.\r\n\r\n[201] Mentioned in c. 4 of the present Book. See p. 9.\r\n\r\n[202] Or “Mars’ Island,” also called Aretias; at this island, in the\r\nsouth of the Euxine, the two queens of the Amazons, Otrere and Antiope,\r\nbuilt a temple in honour of Ares or Mars. It is thought to be the rocky\r\nislet called by the Turks Kerasunt Ada, between three and four miles\r\nfrom Kerasunt, the ancient Pharnacea.\r\n\r\n[203] It is difficult to say what chain of mountains, if indeed any\r\nin particular, he would designate by this name. Parisot remarks that\r\nthese mountains would seem to belong rather to the region of poetry and\r\nfable than of fact, and states that it is pretty clear that the Balkan\r\nchain, the districts in which the Danube takes its rise, the Alps, the\r\nPyrenees, the Hercynian mountains, and even the chain of Taurus and\r\nCaucasus, have at different times been described or mentioned under\r\nthe name of Riphæan Mountains. It was evidently Pliny’s belief that\r\nthe great Northern or Scythian Ocean skirted the northern shores of\r\nAsia, a little above the latitude perhaps of the northern extremity\r\nof the Caspian. In B. iv. c. 26, we find him crossing these, perhaps\r\nimaginary, mountains, and then proceeding to the left, along, as he\r\nsupposes, the extreme northern shores of Europe; here he seems to start\r\nfrom the same point, but turns to the right, and proceeds along the\r\nnorthern, eastern, and southern shores of Asia.\r\n\r\n[204] North-east.\r\n\r\n[205] _I. e._ more to the west.\r\n\r\n[206] See B. iv. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[207] The extremity of the supposed shores of the Hyperborei.\r\n\r\n[208] D’Anville supposes that he means the headland called Cande-Noss\r\nor Kanin-Noss, in the White Sea. Parisot, who thinks that Pliny had no\r\nidea of the regions which lie in those high latitudes, supposes that\r\nhe refers to Domnes-Ness in the Baltic, and that by the Carambucis he\r\nmeans the river Niemen.\r\n\r\n[209] Ansart thinks that he means the Dwina, which falls into the Gulf\r\nof Archangel.\r\n\r\n[210] Previously mentioned in c. 7.\r\n\r\n[211] For a full description of them, see B. iv. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[212] See the Note to c. 7, p. 15. This description is borrowed from\r\nthat given by Herodotus. Their sacred character has been explained as\r\nreferring to the class or caste of priests among this Eastern people,\r\nwhoever they may have been.\r\n\r\n[213] Ansart thinks that the Cicianthi, the Georgi, and the Amazons,\r\ninhabited the modern governments of Archangel and Vologda. It seems\r\nalmost akin to rashness to hazard a conjecture.\r\n\r\n[214] It has been already stated that the Caspian Sea was, in one\r\nportion of it, so called, and in another the Hyrcanian Sea.\r\n\r\n[215] His meaning is, that the Scythian ocean communicates on the\r\nnorthern shores of Asia with the Caspian Sea. Hardouin remarks, that\r\nPatrocles, the commander of the Macedonian fleet, was the first to\r\npromulgate this notion, he having taken the mouth of the river Volga\r\nfor a narrow passage, by means of which the Scythian or Northern Ocean\r\nmade its way into the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n[216] The country of the Cadusii, in the mountainous district of Media\r\nAtropatene, on the south-west shores of the Caspian Sea, between\r\nthe parallels of 390 and 370 north latitude. This district probably\r\ncorresponds with the modern district of Gilan.\r\n\r\n[217] Now the Syr-Daria or Yellow River, and watering the barren\r\nsteppes of the Kirghiz-Cossacks. It really discharges itself into the\r\nSea of Aral, and not the Caspian.\r\n\r\n[218] The supposed Eastern Ocean of the ancients.\r\n\r\n[219] The imaginary passage by which it was supposed to communicate\r\nwith the Scythian Ocean.\r\n\r\n[220] This being in reality the mouth of the Rha or Volga, as mentioned\r\nin Note 18, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[221] On the eastern side.\r\n\r\n[222] Across the mouths of the Volga.\r\n\r\n[223] On a promontory, on the right or eastern side of the mouth of the\r\nriver Volga.\r\n\r\n[224] He here means the western shores of the Caspian, after leaving\r\nthe mouth of the Volga.\r\n\r\n[225] In c. 11.\r\n\r\n[226] See the end of c. 14.\r\n\r\n[227] The Cæsius of Ptolemy, and the Koisou of modern times.\r\n\r\n[228] Probably the modern river Samour.\r\n\r\n[229] It is difficult to determine the exact locality of this river,\r\nbut it would seem to have been near the Amardus, the modern Sefid-Rúd.\r\n\r\n[230] In c. 10.\r\n\r\n[231] See the beginning of c. 12, and the Note, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[232] See c. 10.\r\n\r\n[233] He alludes to the town of Arbela, where, as it is generally\r\nsaid, the army of Darius was defeated by Alexander the Great; by which\r\nengagement the conflict was terminated. It was the fact, however, that\r\nDarius left his baggage and treasures at Arbela, while the battle\r\nreally took place near the village of Gaugamela, about twenty miles to\r\nthe north-west of Arbela. This place still retains its name of Arbil.\r\n\r\n[234] A district in the east of Macedonia, bordering on the Thermaic\r\ngulf and the Chalcidic peninsula.\r\n\r\n[235] Nothing is known of this place. Hardouin suggests that it may\r\nhave been built on the spot where Alexander defeated Darius.\r\n\r\n[236] Also known as Antiochia Mygdoniæ, the capital of Mygdonia. Its\r\nruins are still to be seen near a place called Nisibin. It stood on the\r\nriver Mygdonius, now the Nahral Huali.\r\n\r\n[237] Or Nineveh, the capital of the great Assyrian monarchy, destroyed\r\nby the Medes and Babylonians about B.C. 606.\r\n\r\n[238] There is great difficulty in ascertaining, from the accounts\r\ngiven by the ancient writers, the exact limits of this district, but it\r\nis supposed to have included a considerable portion of the province now\r\nknown by the name of Azerbaijan. It derived its name from Atropates or\r\nAtropes, who was governor of this district under the last Darius.\r\n\r\n[239] Most probably the place now known as Gazæa, the royal residence\r\nof the Parthian kings, and, as its name would imply, their treasure\r\ncity. Colonel Rawlinson thinks that this place underwent many changes\r\nof name according to the rulers who successively occupied it; among\r\nother names, it appears to have borne that of Ecbatana.\r\n\r\n[240] A city of great magnitude, pleasantly situate near the foot of\r\nMount Orontes, in the northern part of Greater Media. Its original\r\nfoundation was attributed by Diodorus Siculus to Semiramis, and by\r\nHerodotus to Deioces. It was the capital of the Median kingdom, and\r\nafterwards the summer residence of the Persian and Parthian kings. The\r\ngenuine orthography of the name seems to be Agbatana. The ruins seen\r\nat the modern Hamadan are generally supposed to represent those of the\r\nancient Ecbatana; but it is most probable that at different times, if\r\nnot contemporaneously, there were several cities of this name in Media.\r\n\r\n[241] Pliny in this statement, as also in the distances which he here\r\nassigns to Ecbatana, is supposed to have confounded Ecbatana with\r\nEuropus, now Veramin, rebuilt by Seleucus Nicator.\r\n\r\n[242] This was a city in the vicinity of Rhagæ, which was distant about\r\n500 stadia from the Caspian Gates. It was built by the Greeks after the\r\nMacedonian conquest of Asia. The other places here mentioned do not\r\nappear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[243] See the beginning of c. 12, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[244] This was the name of the wild tribes which occupied the high\r\nmountainous district between the great upland of Persia and the low\r\nplains of Mesopotamia. In addition to the name mentioned by Pliny, they\r\nwere called Gordyæ, Cardaces, and Curtii. The present Kurds, inhabiting\r\nKurdistan, are supposed to be descended from them.\r\n\r\n[245] The Greek παρ’ ὁδὸν, “on the road”—meaning, probably, to the\r\nCaspian Gates. Hardouin says that the Pratitæ were so called from the\r\nGreek πρατῖται, “merchants.”\r\n\r\n[246] Although dwelling at a considerable distance, the custody of\r\nthese gates was delivered to them, Hardouin says, by the kings of Media.\r\n\r\n[247] To the south-east of them.\r\n\r\n[248] Mentioned in c. 29 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[249] Or Choarene.\r\n\r\n[250] Its site is unknown; but it is mentioned by Appian as one of the\r\nmany towns erected by Seleucus.\r\n\r\n[251] By the use of the word “quondam,” he implies that in his time it\r\nwas in ruins.\r\n\r\n[252] A place of considerable importance, which seems to have derived\r\nits name from its “hundred gates.” It was one of the capitals of the\r\nArsacidan princes; but, extensive though it may have been, there is\r\ngreat doubt where it was situate, the distance recorded by ancient\r\nwriters not corresponding with any known ruins.\r\n\r\n[253] In a northern direction, along the western shores of the Caspian.\r\n\r\n[254] According to Hardouin, Eratosthenes, as quoted by Strabo,\r\nmakes the distance 5060 stadia, or about 633 miles. He has, however,\r\nmis-translated the passage, which gives 5600 stadia, or 700 miles\r\nexactly, as stated by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[255] Or 1960 miles.\r\n\r\n[256] Bactra, Bactrum, or Bactrium, was one of the chief cities, if\r\nnot the capital, of the province of Bactriana. It was one of the most\r\nancient cities in the world, and the modern Balkh is generally supposed\r\nto occupy its site. Strabo, as well as Pliny, evidently considers that\r\nBactra and Zareispa were the same place, while Appian distinguishes\r\nbetween the two, though he does not clearly state their relative\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n[257] The modern Syr-Daria, mentioned in c. 15. See p. 25.\r\n\r\n[258] By some writers called Apavareticene, in the south-eastern part\r\nof Parthia. Ansart says that it is now known as Asterabad and Ghilan.\r\n\r\n[259] Or Dara. A strongly fortified place, built by Arsaces I., and\r\nsituate on the mountains of the Zapaorteni.\r\n\r\n[260] According to Ansart, the district now known as Tabaristan, or\r\nMazanderan, derives the first of those names from the Tapyri.\r\n\r\n[261] D’Anville remarks that this river still retains its “starry”\r\nname, being the modern Aster or Ester, on which Asterabad is situate.\r\n\r\n[262] This district occupied the southern part of modern Khiva, the\r\nsouth-western part of Bokhara, and the north-eastern part of Khorassan.\r\nThis province of the ancient Persian empire received its name from the\r\nriver Margus, now the Moorghab. It first became known to the Greeks by\r\nthe expeditions of Alexander and Antiochus I.\r\n\r\n[263] Antiochus Soter, the son of Seleucus Nicator.\r\n\r\n[264] The meaning of this, which has caused great diversity of opinion\r\namong the Commentators, seems to be, that on rebuilding it, he\r\npreferred giving it a name borne by several cities in Syria, and given\r\nto them in honour of kings of that country. To this he appears to have\r\nbeen prompted by a supposed resemblance which its site on the Margus\r\nbore to that of Antiochia on the Orontes.\r\n\r\n[265] The modern Moorghab; it loses itself in the sands of Khiva.\r\n\r\n[266] Its remains are supposed to be those of an ancient city, still to\r\nbe seen at a spot called Merv, on the river Moorghab.\r\n\r\n[267] The people of modern Bokhara.\r\n\r\n[268] This appears to mean the nations of “Chariot horse-breeders.”\r\n\r\n[269] In former editions, called the ‘Gridinus.’ It is impossible to\r\nidentify many of these nations and rivers, as the spelling varies\r\nconsiderably in the respective MSS.\r\n\r\n[270] An extensive tribe of Sogdiana, now represented by the district\r\nof Khawarezm, in the desert country of Khiva.\r\n\r\n[271] A tribe in the north-western part of Sogdiana. They appear to\r\nhave been situate to the east of the district of Khawarezm. It has been\r\nsuggested that they derived their name from the Sanscrit Gandharas, a\r\ntribe beyond the Indus.\r\n\r\n[272] The chief seat of the Aorsi, who appear to have been a numerous\r\nand powerful people both of Europe and Asia, was in the country between\r\nthe Tanais, the Euxine, the Caspian, and the Caucasus. It seems\r\ndoubtful, however, whether it is these people who are alluded to in the\r\npresent passage.\r\n\r\n[273] These would almost seem to be a different people from those\r\nmentioned in c. 15 of the present Book, as dwelling in Atropatene. The\r\npresent appears to have been a tribe of Sogdiana.\r\n\r\n[274] Strabo mentions a town of this name, which he places, together\r\nwith Apamea, in the direction of Rhagæ. If Pliny has observed anything\r\nlike order in his recital of nations and places, the Heraclea here\r\nmentioned cannot be that spoken of by Strabo, but must have been\r\ndistant nearly 1000 miles from it.\r\n\r\n[275] This was a tribe, apparently of Scythian origin, settled\r\nin Margiana, on the left bank of the Oxus. Strabo says that they\r\nworshipped the earth, and forbore to sacrifice or slay any female;\r\nbut that they put to death their fellow-creatures as soon as they had\r\npassed their seventieth year, it being the privilege of the next of kin\r\nto eat the flesh of the deceased person. The aged women, however, they\r\nused to strangle, and then consign them to the earth.\r\n\r\n[276] The modern Jihoun or Amou. It now flows into the Sea of Aral, but\r\nthe ancients universally speak of it as running into the Caspian; and\r\nthere are still existing distinct traces of a channel extending in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction from the sea of Aral to the Caspian, by which\r\nat least a portion, and probably the whole of the waters of the Oxus\r\nfound their way into the Caspian; and not improbably the Sea of Aral\r\nitself was connected with the Caspian by this channel.\r\n\r\n[277] Most probably under this name he means the Sea of Aral.\r\n\r\n[278] The Bactrus. This river is supposed to be represented by the\r\nmodern Dakash. Hardouin says that Ptolemy, B. vi. c. 11, calls this\r\nriver the Zariaspis, or Zariaspes. See the Note at the end of c. 17, p.\r\n30.\r\n\r\n[279] Now known as the Hindoo-Koosh; a part of the great mountain-chain\r\nwhich runs from west to east through the centre of the southern portion\r\nof the highlands of Central Asia, and so divides the part of the\r\ncontinent which slopes down to the Indian ocean from the great central\r\ntable-land of Tartary and Thibet. The native term, Hindoo-Koosh, is\r\nonly a form of the ancient name “Indicus Caucasus,” which was sometimes\r\ngiven to this chain. The ancient name was derived probably from the\r\nPersian word _paru_, a “mountain.”\r\n\r\n[280] Flowing from the north side of the Paropanisus. According to\r\nPliny and Ptolemy, this river flowed through Bactria into the Oxus;\r\nbut according to Strabo, through Hyrcania into the Caspian Sea. Some\r\nsuppose it to have been only another name for the Oxus. Ansart suggests\r\nthat it may have been the river now known as the Bash.\r\n\r\n[281] D’Anville says that there is still the valley of Al Sogd, in\r\nTartary, beyond the Oxus. The district called Sogdiana was probably\r\ncomposed of parts of modern Turkistan and Bokhara. The site of Panda\r\ndoes not appear to be known.\r\n\r\n[282] It was built on the Jaxartes, to mark the furthest point reached\r\nby Alexander in his Scythian expedition. It has been suggested that the\r\nmodern Kokend may possibly occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[283] The “twin,” of the same birth with Diana.\r\n\r\n[284] The Sacæ probably formed one of the most numerous and most\r\npowerful of the Scythian Nomad tribes, and dwelt to the east and\r\nnorth-east of the Massagetæ, as far as Servia, in the steppes of\r\nCentral Asia, which are now peopled by the Kirghiz Cossacks, in whose\r\nname that of their ancestors, the Sacæ, is traced by some geographers.\r\n\r\n[285] Meaning the “Great Getæ.” They dwelt beyond the Jaxartes and the\r\nSea of Aral, and their country corresponds to that of the Khirghiz\r\nTartars in the north of Independent Tartary.\r\n\r\n[286] The Dahæ were a numerous and warlike Nomad tribe, who wandered\r\nover the vast steppes lying to the east of the Caspian Sea. Strabo has\r\ngrouped them with the Sacæ and Massagetæ, as the great Scythian tribes\r\nof Inner Asia, to the north of Bactriana.\r\n\r\n[287] See also B. iv. c. 20, and B. vi. c. 7. The position of the\r\nEssedones, or perhaps more correctly, the Issedones, may probably be\r\nassigned to the east of Ichim, in the steppes of the central border of\r\nthe Kirghiz, in the immediate vicinity of the Arimaspi, who dwelt on\r\nthe northern declivity of the Altaï chain. A communication is supposed\r\nto have been carried on between these two peoples for the exchange of\r\nthe gold that was the produce of those mountain districts.\r\n\r\n[288] They dwelt, according to Ptolemy, along the southern banks of the\r\nJaxartes.\r\n\r\n[289] Or the Mardi, a warlike Asiatic tribe. Stephanus Byzantinus,\r\nfollowing Strabo, places the Amardi near the Hyrcani, and adds, “There\r\nare also Persian Mardi, without the _a_;” and, speaking of the Mardi,\r\nhe mentions them as an Hyrcanian tribe, of predatory habits, and\r\nskilled in archery.\r\n\r\n[290] D’Anville supposes that the Euchatæ may have dwelt at the modern\r\nKoten, in Little Bukharia. It is suggested, however, by Parisot, that\r\nthey may have possibly occupied a valley of the Himalaya, in the midst\r\nof a country known as “Cathai,” or the “desert.”\r\n\r\n[291] The first extant notice of them is in Herodotus; but before him\r\nthere was the poem of Aristeas of Proconnesus, of which the title\r\nwas ‘Arimaspea;’ and it is mainly upon the statements in it that the\r\nstories told relative to this people rest—such as their being one-eyed,\r\nand as to their stealing the gold from the Gryphes, or Griffins, under\r\nwhose custody it was placed. Their locality is by some supposed to have\r\nbeen on the left bank of the Middle Volga, in the governments of Kasan,\r\nSimbirsk, and Saratov: a locality which is sufficiently near the gold\r\ndistricts of the Uralian chain to account for the legends connecting\r\nthem with the Gryphes, or guardians of the gold.\r\n\r\n[292] The former reading was, “The Napæi are said to have perished as\r\nwell as the Apellæi.” Sillig has, however, in all probability, restored\r\nthe correct one. “Finding,” he says, “in the work of Diodorus Siculus,\r\nthat two peoples of Scythia were called, from their two kings, who\r\nwere brothers, the Napi and the Pali, we have followed close upon the\r\nfootsteps of certain MSS. of Pliny, and have come to the conclusion\r\nthat some disputes arose between these peoples, which ultimately led to\r\nthe destruction of one of them”.\r\n\r\n[293] Of the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n[294] Said on the supposition that it is a bay or gulf of the Scythian\r\nor Septentrional Ocean.\r\n\r\n[295] Ansart suggests that this is the modern Rocsha.\r\n\r\n[296] From the Oxus.\r\n\r\n[297] Ansart suggests that this island is that now called Idak, one of\r\nthe Ogurtchinski group.\r\n\r\n[298] This would apply to the north-eastern coasts of Siberia, if Pliny\r\nhad had any idea of land situate in such high latitudes; but, on the\r\ncontrary, as already remarked, he appears to have supposed that the\r\ncontinent of Asia terminated a little above the northern extremity of\r\nthe Caspian. It would be a loss of time to guess what locality is meant\r\nby the Scythian Promontory.\r\n\r\n[299] Or “man-eaters.”\r\n\r\n[300] This, it would appear, he looks upon as the extreme north-eastern\r\npoint of Asia. Parisot suggests that the word Tabis is allied to the\r\nMongol Daba, which signifies “mountain;” or else that it may have some\r\naffinity with “Thibet.”\r\n\r\n[301] The people of Serica, which country with Ptolemy corresponds to\r\nthe north-western part of China, and the adjacent portions of Thibet\r\nand Chinese Tartary. The capital, Sera, is by most supposed to be\r\nSingan, on the Hoang-ho, but by some Peking. Pliny evidently refers to\r\nthe same people, and has some notion of the locality of their country.\r\n\r\n[302] This is generally supposed to bear reference to the cloths\r\nexported by the Seres, as _Serica_, and corresponding to our silks.\r\nOn examination, however, it will appear that he rather refers to some\r\ntextures of cotton, such as calicos or muslins; it being not unknown\r\nto Pliny that silks or _bombycina_ were the produce of the bombyx or\r\nsilk-worm; see B. xi. c. 22. The use of the word “canities” points\r\nstrongly to cotton as being the substance meant.\r\n\r\n[303] Whether it is silk or cotton that is here referred to, Pliny\r\nseems in this passage to allude to some peculiarity in the texture,\r\nwhich was perhaps so close, that when brought to the Western world\r\nit was the custom to draw out a portion of the threads. In such case\r\nit perhaps strongly resembled the Chinese crapes of the present day.\r\nSpeaking of Cleopatra in B. x. 141, of the Pharsalia, Lucan says, “Her\r\nwhite breasts are resplendent through the Sidonian fabric, which,\r\nwrought in close texture by the sley of the Seres, the needle of\r\nthe workman of the Nile has separated, and has loosened the warp by\r\nstretching out the web.”\r\n\r\n[304] He either refers to dresses consisting of nothing but open work,\r\nor what we may call fine lace, and made from the closely woven material\r\nimported from China, or else to the ‘Coan vestments’ which were so\r\nmuch worn by the Roman women, especially those of light character,\r\nin the Augustan age. This Coan tissue was remarkable for its extreme\r\ntransparency. It has been supposed that these dresses were made of\r\nsilk, as in the island of Cos silk was spun and woven at an early\r\nperiod, so much so as to obtain a high celebrity for the manufactures\r\nof that island. Seneca, B. vii. De Benef. severely censures the\r\npractice of wearing these thin garments. For further information on\r\nthis subject, see B. xi. c. 26, 27, and B. xii. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[305] Meaning that they do not actively seek intercourse with the rest\r\nof the world, but do not refuse to trade with those who will take the\r\ntrouble of resorting to them. This coincides wonderfully with the\r\ncharacter of the Chinese even at the present day.\r\n\r\n[306] Ptolemy speaks of it as the Œchordas.\r\n\r\n[307] The headland of Malacca, in the Aurea Chersonnesus, was also\r\ncalled by this name, but it is hardly probable that that is the place\r\nhere meant.\r\n\r\n[308] See B. iv. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[309] The Emodi Montes (so called probably from the Indian _hemâdri_,\r\nor the “golden”) are supposed to have formed that portion of the great\r\nlateral branch of the Indian Caucasus, the range of the Himalaya, which\r\nextends along Nepaul, and probably as far as Bhotan.\r\n\r\n[310] In c. 14 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[311] The whole of this passage seems very intricate, and it is\r\ndifficult to make sense of it. His meaning, however, is probably this:\r\nthat the coast of India, running from extreme north-east to south-east,\r\nrelatively to Greece, the country of Eratosthenes, is exactly\r\nopposite to the coast of Gaul, running from extreme north-west to\r\nsouth-west—India thus lying due west of Gaul, without any intervening\r\nland. This, it will be remembered, was the notion of Columbus, when\r\ncontemplating the possibility of a western passage to India.\r\n\r\n[312] This appears also to be somewhat obscure. It is clear that if\r\nIndia lies to the west of Gaul, it cannot be Pliny’s meaning that it\r\nis refreshed by the _west_ wind blowing _to_ it _from_ Gaul. He may\r\npossibly mean that the west wind, which is so refreshing to the west\r\nof Europe, and Gaul in particular, first sweeps over India, and thus\r\nbecomes productive of that salubrity which Posidonius seems to have\r\ndiscovered in India, but for which we look in vain at the present\r\nday. Amid, however, such multiplied chances of a corrupt text, it is\r\nimpossible to assume any very definite position as to his probable\r\nmeaning. The French translators offer no assistance in solving the\r\ndifficulty, and Holland renders it, “This west wind which _from behind_\r\nGaul bloweth upon India, is very healthsome,” &c.\r\n\r\n[313] As to the Etesian winds, see B. ii. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[314] In the geographical work which Patrocles seems to have published,\r\nhe is supposed to have given some account of the countries bordering\r\non the Caspian Sea, and there is little doubt that, like other writers\r\nof that period, he regarded that sea as a gulf or inlet of the\r\nSeptentrional Ocean, and probably maintained the possibility of sailing\r\nthither by sea from the Indian Ocean. This statement, however, seems to\r\nhave been strangely misinterpreted by Pliny in his present assertion,\r\nthat Patrocles had himself accomplished this circumnavigation.\r\n\r\n[315] Sec B. v. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[316] Or Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[317] Or seventy-five miles.\r\n\r\n[318] This is the statement of Arrian.\r\n\r\n[319] Among the lost works of that philosopher.\r\n\r\n[320] In c. 17 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[321] See c. 25 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[322] See c. 25 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[323] See c. 25 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[324] A town placed by Strabo on the confines of Bactriana, and by\r\nPtolemy in the county of the Paropanisidæ.\r\n\r\n[325] See c. 25 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[326] See c. 24 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[327] The present Attok, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[328] One of the principal rivers of that part of India known as the\r\nPunjaub. It rises in the north-western Himalayah mountains in Kashmere,\r\nand after flowing nearly south, falls into the Acesines or Chenab. Its\r\npresent most usual name is the Jhelum.\r\n\r\n[329] The most eastern, and most important of the five rivers which\r\nwater the country of the Punjaub. Rising in the western Himalaya, it\r\nflows in two principal branches, in a course nearly south-west (under\r\nthe names respectively of Vipasa and Satadru), which it retains till it\r\nfalls into the Indus at Mittimkote. It is best known, however, by its\r\nmodern name of Sutlej, probably a corrupt form of the Sanscrit Satadru.\r\n\r\n[330] See c. 18 of the present Book. The altars there spoken of, as\r\nconsecrated by Alexander the Great, appear to have been erected in\r\nSogdiana, whereas those here mentioned were dedicated in the Indian\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n[331] It does not appear that this river has been identified. In most\r\nof the editions it is called Hesidrus; but, as Sillig observes, there\r\nwas a town of India, near the Indus, called Sydros, which probably\r\nreceived its name from this river.\r\n\r\n[332] It has been suggested that this place is the modern Kanouge, on\r\nthe Ganges.\r\n\r\n[333] The modern Jumna. It must be borne in mind by the reader, that\r\nthe numbers given in this Chapter vary considerably in the different\r\nMSS.\r\n\r\n[334] See the next Chapter.\r\n\r\n[335] The Sanscrit for “snowy” is “_himarat_.” The name of Emodus,\r\ncombined with Imaüs, seems here to be a description of the knot of\r\nmountains formed by the intersections of the Himalaya, the Hindoo\r\nKoosh, and the Bolor range; the latter having been for many ages the\r\nboundary between the empires of China and Turkistan. It is pretty\r\nclear, that, like Ptolemy, Pliny imagined that the Imaüs ran from south\r\nto north; but it seems hardly necessary, in this instance at least,\r\nto give to the word “promontorium” the meaning attached to our word\r\n“promontory,” and to suppose that he implies that the range of the\r\nImaüs runs down to the verge of the eastern ocean.\r\n\r\n[336] A name evidently given to numerous tribes of India, from the\r\ncircumstance that Alexander and his followers found it borne by the\r\nBrahmins or priestly caste of the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n[337] Still called the Cane, a navigable river of India within the\r\nGanges, falling into the Ganges, according to Arrian as well as Pliny,\r\nthough in reality it falls into the Jumna.\r\n\r\n[338] The Calingæ, who are further mentioned in the next Chapter,\r\nprobably dwelt in the vicinity of the promontory of Calingon, upon\r\nwhich was the town of Dandaguda, mentioned in c. 23 of the present\r\nBook. This promontory and city are usually identified with those of\r\nCalinapatnam, about half-way between the rivers Mahanuddy and Godavery;\r\nand the territory of the Calingæ seems to correspond pretty nearly to\r\nthe district of Circars, lying along the coast of Orissa.\r\n\r\n[339] By the Malli, Parisot is of opinion that the people of Moultan\r\nare meant.\r\n\r\n[340] So much so, indeed, that its sources were unknown to the learned\r\nworld till the beginning of the present century, although the Chinese\r\nemperor Tang-Hi on one occasion sent a body of Llamas for the purpose\r\nof inquiring into the subject. It is now ascertained that the river\r\nGanges is the result of the confluence of three separate streams, which\r\nbear the respective names of the Gannavi, the Bhagirathi, and the\r\nAlakananda. The second is of the most sacred character, and is the one\r\nto which the largest concourse of pilgrims resort. The ancients held\r\nvarious opinions as to the sources of the river.\r\n\r\n[341] The Cainas and the Jomanes, mentioned in the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[342] The modern Gandaki or Gundûk is generally supposed to be\r\nrepresented by the Condochates.\r\n\r\n[343] Represented as flowing into the Ganges at Palimbothra, the modern\r\nPatna. There has been considerable discussion among the learned as to\r\nwhat river is indicated by this name. It has, however, been considered\r\nmost probable that it is the same as the Sonus of Pliny, the modern\r\nSoane, though both that author, as well as Arrian, speaks of two\r\nrivers, which they call respectively Erannoboas and Sonus. The name was\r\nprobably derived from the Sanscrit Hyranyavahas, the poetical name of\r\nthe Sonus.\r\n\r\n[344] Supposed to be the same as the river Cosi or Coravaha.\r\n\r\n[345] The wide diffusion of the Calingæ, and their close connection\r\nwith the Gangaridæ, are shown by the fact that Pliny here calls them\r\n“Calingæ Gangarides,” and mentions the Modogalingæ on a large island in\r\nthe Ganges, and the Maccocalingæ on the upper course of that river. See\r\nnote [338], p. 42.\r\n\r\n[346] Called Parthalis in most of the editions.\r\n\r\n[347] Or _castes_, as we call them. These institutions prevail equally\r\nat the present day, and the divisions of the duties of the respective\r\ncastes are pretty much as Pliny states them to be, except that the\r\nhusbandmen and merchants form one class, called the Vaisya, the\r\nBrahmins being the ministers of religion, the Kshatriya forming the\r\nwarlike class, the Sudra constituting the menial or servant class.\r\nPliny here represents the rulers and councillors as forming a distinct\r\nclass. Such, however, does not appear to be the fact; for we find that\r\nthe sovereign is chosen from the Kshatriya or military class, while\r\nfrom the Brahmins are selected the royal councillors, judges, and\r\nmagistrates of the country.\r\n\r\n[348] He alludes to the Brahmins, who seem to have been called by the\r\nGreek writers “Gymnosophists,” or “naked wise men.” The Brahmin Calanus\r\nis a memorable example of this kind of self-immolation.\r\n\r\n[349] It is extremely doubtful if, even in his own day, Pliny was\r\ncorrect in venturing upon so sweeping an assertion.\r\n\r\n[350] The Sudra or menial caste.\r\n\r\n[351] He is incorrect here; these duties devolve on the Vaisya class.\r\n\r\n[352] Inhabited, probably, by a branch of the Calingæ previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[353] Ansart suggests that this may be the modern kingdom of Pegu. He\r\nthinks also that the preceding kingdom may be that now called Arracan.\r\n\r\n[354] These may possibly be the Daradræ of Ptolemy, but it seems\r\nimpossible to guess their locality.\r\n\r\n[355] Probably the present Patna. D’Anville, however, identifies it\r\nwith Allahabad, while Welford and Wahl are inclined to think it the\r\nsame as Radjeurah, formerly called Balipoutra or Bengala. The Prasii\r\nare probably the race of people mentioned in the ancient Sanscrit\r\nbooks under the name of the “Pragi” or the Eastern Empire, while\r\nthe Gangarides are mentioned in the same works under the name of\r\n“Gandaressa” or Kingdom of the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[356] Hardouin is of opinion that these nations dwelt in the localities\r\noccupied by the districts of Gwalior and Agra.\r\n\r\n[357] The Septentriones or “Seven Trions,” in the original. Parisot\r\nis of opinion that under this name of Mount Maleus he alludes to the\r\nWestern Ghauts, and that the name still survives in the word Malabar.\r\nHe also remarks that this statement of Pliny is not greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[358] Ansart says that this is the same as the modern town of Muttra or\r\nMatra upon the Jumna, and to the north of Agra.\r\n\r\n[359] Or Clisobora, according to Hardouin. It does not appear to have\r\nbeen identified.\r\n\r\n[360] In the Indian Peninsula, constituting more especially the\r\npresidency of Madras.\r\n\r\n[361] It is clear that he looks upon the countries of the Indus as\r\nlying to the south of the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[362] Or Hindoo Koosh. In this statement he is supported by Arrian,\r\nStrabo, Mela, and Quintus Curtius. It rises, however, a considerable\r\ndistance on the north-east side of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n[363] The modern Jhelum.\r\n\r\n[364] Some writers suppose that this must be the same as the Hydraotes,\r\nor modern Ravi, because the latter is not otherwise found mentioned\r\nin the list given by Pliny. The name, however, leaves but little\r\ndoubt that Pliny had heard of the Acesines under its Indian name of\r\nChandabragha, and out of it has made another river.\r\n\r\n[365] The modern Sutlej.\r\n\r\n[366] Probably in the vicinity of the modern Calingapatam; none of the\r\nother places seem to be identified.\r\n\r\n[367] Ansart suggests that the Cesi may be the same race as the modern\r\nSikhs.\r\n\r\n[368] Perhaps the people of modern Ajmere.\r\n\r\n[369] These peoples are supposed by Hardouin to have occupied the\r\nsouthern parts of the peninsula now known as Bisnagar, Calicut, and the\r\nDeccan, with the Malabar and Coromandel coasts.\r\n\r\n[370] Hardouin suggests that this people dwelt on the present peninsula\r\nof Guzerat.\r\n\r\n[371] None of these appear to have been identified; indeed, it appears\r\nto be next to impossible, owing to the corrupt state in which they have\r\ncome down to us.\r\n\r\n[372] Built on the Hydaspes by Alexander after his victory over Porus,\r\nB.C. 326, at the spot where he had crossed the river before the battle,\r\nand in memory of his celebrated charger Bucephalus, who had expired\r\nduring the battle from fatigue and old age, or from wounds. The exact\r\nsite of this place is not known, but the probabilities appear in favour\r\nof Jhelum, at which place is the usual passage of the river, or else of\r\nJellapoor, about sixteen miles lower down.\r\n\r\n[373] Probably the same that is mentioned in c. 21 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[374] Parisot supposes that these were the inhabitants of the district\r\nwhich now bears the name of Pekheli.\r\n\r\n[375] Gedrosia comprehended probably the same district as is now known\r\nby the name of Mekran, or, according to some, the whole of modern\r\nBeloochistan.\r\n\r\n[376] The people of the city and district of Arachotus, the capital of\r\nArachosia. M. Court has identified some ruins on the Argasan river,\r\nnear Kandahar, on the road to Shikarpur, with those of Arachotus; but\r\nProfessor Wilson considers them to be too much to the south-east.\r\nColonel Rawlinson thinks they are those to be seen at a place called\r\nUlan Robat. He states that the most ancient name of the city, Cophen,\r\n(mentioned by Pliny in c. 25 of the present Book), has given rise to\r\nthe territorial designation. See p. 57.\r\n\r\n[377] The people of Aria, consisting of the eastern part of Khorassan,\r\nand the western and north-western part of Afghanistan. This was one of\r\nthe most important of the eastern provinces or satrapies of the Persian\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n[378] This was the collective name of several peoples dwelling on the\r\nsouthern slopes of the Hindoo Koosh, and of the country which they\r\ninhabited, which was not known by any other name. It corresponded to\r\nthe eastern part of modern Afghanistan and the portion of the Punjaub\r\nlying to the west of the Indus.\r\n\r\n[379] It is supposed that the Cophes is represented by the modern river\r\nof Kabul.\r\n\r\n[380] The place here alluded to was in the district of Goryæa, at\r\nthe north-western corner of the Punjaub, near the confluence of the\r\nrivers Cophen and Choaspes, being probably the same place as Nagara or\r\nDionysopolis, the modern Nagar or Naggar.\r\n\r\n[381] The word μήρος, in Greek, signifying a “thigh.”\r\n\r\n[382] Supposed by some to have been Lower Scinde, and the vicinity of\r\nKurrachee, with its capital Potala.\r\n\r\n[383] Ansart suggests that these may be the Laccadives. Their name\r\nmeans the “gold” and “silver” islands.\r\n\r\n[384] Probably an island near the mouths of the Indus.\r\n\r\n[385] Probably the same as the Bibacta of Arrian. The present name of\r\nit is Chilney Isle.\r\n\r\n[386] Although Poinsinet will not admit its identity, it is now\r\nuniversally agreed among the learned that the island of Taprobana is\r\nthe modern Ceylon. As Gosselin observes, in the accounts said to have\r\nbeen given of Ceylon by the ambassadors to Claudius, great allowance\r\nmust be made for the wrong interpretation which, owing to their\r\nignorance of the language, the Romans must have given to much of their\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n[387] From ἀντὶ, “opposite,” and χθών, “the earth.” Its people being\r\nsupposed to be the _antipodes_ of those of Europe.\r\n\r\n[388] “The ancient race.” As Ansart observes, the island contains a\r\nmountain, the name of which is “Adam’s” Peak.\r\n\r\n[389] Ælian makes the villages to be 750 in number.\r\n\r\n[390] A general term probably, as already stated, for the great\r\npeninsula of India, below the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[391] This expression has been relied upon by those who do not admit\r\nthat Ceylon is identical with the ancient Taprobana. But it is not\r\nimprobable that the passage here referred to is from Cape Comorin\r\nto Ceylon, and not from Cape Ramanan Cor, the nearest part of the\r\ncontinent. In such case, the distance would be sixty-five or sixty-six\r\nleagues, and we can easily conceive that Greek vessels, sailing from\r\nnine to ten leagues per day, might occupy seven days in making the\r\npassage from Cape Comorin, past Ramanan Cor, to the coasts of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[392] The amphora, as a measure, contained eight congii, or forty-eight\r\nsextarii.\r\n\r\n[393] Or “Septentrio;” “the Seven Trions,” which was more especially\r\nemployed by the nations of Europe for the purposes of navigation.\r\n\r\n[394] Parisot suggests that the word “Radijah,” or “Rajah,” denoting\r\nthe rank which he held, may have been here taken by Pliny for his name.\r\n\r\n[395] Ptolemy says that the ancient name of the island was Simundi, or\r\nPalæsimundi, but speaks of no such city as the one here mentioned, nor\r\nindeed of any other of the localities described by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[396] It is difficult to say whether by this name is meant the modern\r\nCape Comorin, or that known as Ramanan Cor, which is in reality the\r\nnearest point to the coast of Ceylon. Perhaps the latter is meant; in\r\nwhich case it is not improbable that the Island of the Sun will be\r\nrepresented by the islet called Rameserum in the maps, or else the one\r\nadjoining called Manaar. It must not be confounded with the Island of\r\nthe Sun, mentioned in c. 26. See p. 60.\r\n\r\n[397] It is not improbable that he alludes to coral reefs.\r\n\r\n[398] This assertion Gosselin would either reject as a fabulous\r\nfalsehood, or as having originated in some misconception on the part\r\nof the Romans; for, as he remarks, it is quite impossible that the\r\nPleiades should be a constellation unknown at that time to the people\r\nof Ceylon; but, on the other hand, it would be equally true that the\r\nGreater Bear was concealed from them.\r\n\r\n[399] This was also a fable, or else originated in misapprehension of\r\ntheir language on the part of the Romans.\r\n\r\n[400] Gosselin remarks that their story may have been that for about\r\nseven months in the year the shadows fell to the north, and during the\r\nremaining five to the south, which would not have been inconsistent\r\nwith the truth.\r\n\r\n[401] This also is classed by Gosselin under the head either of\r\nfabulous stories or misapprehensions.\r\n\r\n[402] “Seras—ab ipsis aspici.” It is difficult to say whether this does\r\nnot mean that they were in sight of the coast of the Seræ. Under any\r\ncircumstances, the Seræ here spoken of must not be taken for the Seres\r\nor supposed Chinese. Gosselin remarks that under this name the people\r\nof a district called Sera are probably referred to, and that in fact\r\nsuch is the name of a city and a whole province at the present day,\r\nsituate on the opposite coast, beyond the mountains which terminate the\r\nplains of the Carnatic. It is equally impossible that under the name\r\nof “Emodi” Pliny can allude to the Himalaya chain, distant more than\r\n2000 miles. The mountains, on the verge of the plains of the Carnatic,\r\nare not improbably those here referred to, and it is not impossible\r\nthat they may be discerned from the shores of Ceylon. Gosselin is of\r\nopinion that the name of the ancient Seræ may still be traced in that\r\nof Seringapatam, and of the city of Seringham, situate on the river\r\nGodavery.\r\n\r\n[403] Relative to the Seræ, or inhabitants of the opposite shores.\r\n\r\n[404] Or “Bacchus.” This means that he wears a long robe with a train;\r\nmuch like the dress, in fact, which was worn on the stage by tragic\r\nactors.\r\n\r\n[405] “Festa venatione absumi, gratissimam eam tigribus elephantisque\r\nconstare.” Holland gives this sentence quite a different meaning,\r\nfancying that it bears reference to the mode in which the guilty king\r\ncomes to his end, which, indeed, otherwise does not appear to be\r\nstated. “But to doe him to death in the end, they appoint a solemne\r\nday of hunting, right pleasant and agreable unto tigres and elephants,\r\nbefore which beasts they expose their king, and so he is presently by\r\nthem devoured.” It is difficult to say, however, where he finds all\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n[406] It is much more probable that they used the shells for the\r\npurpose of making roofs for their habitations.\r\n\r\n[407] Mentioned already, towards the conclusion of c. 23 of the present\r\nBook. See p. 51.\r\n\r\n[408] This place was included in the district of the Paropanisus or\r\nHindoo Koosh. It is doubtful whether Pliny is correct in saying that\r\nit was destroyed by Cyrus, as we have no reason for supposing that he\r\never advanced so far to the north-east. It is supposed by some that\r\nCapisene represents the valley of the Kabul river, and Capisa the town\r\non the Indus, now known as Peshawar. Lassen, in his researches, has\r\nfound in the Chinese annals a kingdom called Kiapiche, in the valley of\r\nGhurbend, to the east of Bamian. It is not improbable that Capisa and\r\nKiapiche were different forms of the same name.\r\n\r\n[409] See the Notes in p. 50.\r\n\r\n[410] The principal river of Drangiana, which rises in the lower range\r\nof the Paropanisus or Hindoo Koosh, and enters Lake Zarah. Its present\r\nname is Ilmend or Helmend. Burnouf has supposed it to be the same as\r\nthe Arachotus; but Professor Wilson is of opinion that the Arachotus\r\nwas one of the tributaries of the Erymanthus or Erymandrus, and\r\nprobably the modern Arkand-Ab.\r\n\r\n[411] Parisot takes the meaning of this word to be “valley,” and is of\r\nopinion that it is the modern Chabul; not to be confounded, however,\r\nwith the country of Cabul, to the east of which it is situate.\r\n\r\n[412] Now called Birusen, according to Parisot, and not the city of\r\nCabul, as supposed by Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[413] Or the “four-cornered city.”\r\n\r\n[414] This place has not been identified. It has been suggested that\r\nit is the same as the modern city of Candahar; but that was really\r\nAlexandria of the Paropanisadæ, quite a different place.\r\n\r\n[415] Inhabiting the district now called Arassen, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[416] Inhabiting the modern Danra, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[417] Inhabitants of the modern Parasan, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[418] The modern Candahar is generally supposed to occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[419] Pliny is thought to have here confounded the extensive district\r\nof Ariana with the smaller province of Aria, which only formed a\r\nportion of it. Ariana comprehended nearly the whole of what had been\r\npreviously ancient Persia.\r\n\r\n[420] The river known in modern times as the Ilincut, according to\r\nParisot.\r\n\r\n[421] This is supposed by Forbiger to be the modern Arghasan, one of\r\nthe tributaries of the Helmend. Parisot says that it was the same as\r\nthe modern Sat.\r\n\r\n[422] Supposed to be the same as the “Aria civitas,” or “city of Aria”\r\nof other authors, which, however, is most probably represented by\r\nAlexandria, the modern Herat, situate on the small stream now called\r\nthe Heri-Rud. At all events, Artacoana (proved by M. Court to be a\r\nword of Persian origin—Arde Koun) was, if not the same place, at a\r\nvery small distance from it. M. Barbie de Bocage is of opinion that it\r\noccupied the site of Fushing, a town on the Heri river, one stage from\r\nHerat; and by M. Court it is thought to have been at Obeh, near the\r\nsame place.\r\n\r\n[423] Now called the Heri-Rud, which runs to the west of Herat.\r\n\r\n[424] It is said that, judging from a traditional verse still current\r\namong the people of Herat, that town is believed to unite the claims\r\nof the ancient capital built by Alexander the Great, or indeed,\r\nmore properly, repaired by him, as he was but a short time in Aria.\r\nThe distance also from the Caspian Gates to Alexandria favours its\r\nidentification with the modern Herat.\r\n\r\n[425] This place does not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[426] Ansart suggests that the river Pharnacotis is the same as the\r\nmodern Ferrichround, and the Ophradus probably the Kouchround.\r\n\r\n[427] Ansart suggests that the modern name is Zarang. Parisot says that\r\nit is Corcharistan.\r\n\r\n[428] The inhabitants of Drangiana, a district at the eastern end of\r\nthe modern kingdom of Persia, and comprehending part of the present\r\nSejestan or Seistan.\r\n\r\n[429] They gave its name to the modern Eudras, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[430] It is doubtful whether these are the same as the Gedrosi,\r\nmentioned by Pliny in c. 23, 24. Parisot censures Hardouin for\r\nconfounding them, and says that these inhabited the modern Bassar. In\r\nDr. Smith’s _Dictionary_, they are looked upon as the same people.\r\n\r\n[431] Parisot says that this is the desert region now known as\r\nEremaier, to the east of Mount Maugracot.\r\n\r\n[432] As Parisot remarks, our author is now approaching the sea-shore;\r\nthese places, however, do not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[433] Not the same as the river Cophen or Cophes mentioned in c. 24,\r\nthe modern Kabul. Hardouin takes it to be the same as the Arbis or\r\nArabius of Ptolemy, the modern Hilmend or Ilmend.\r\n\r\n[434] Parisot seems to think that the modern names of these rivers are\r\nthe Sal, the Ghir, and the Ilmentel, which, according to him, flow into\r\nthe Ilmend.\r\n\r\n[435] Situate, according to Ptolemy, in the eastern parts of Media.\r\n\r\n[436] For this measurement see c. 21.\r\n\r\n[437] Meaning the “Fish-eating Mountaineers.” According to Parisot they\r\noccupied the site of the modern Dulcidan, and Goadel, which are bounded\r\nby mountains, whence the name.\r\n\r\n[438] Not only the Oritæ, but all those mentioned in the following\r\nChapter. For further particulars as to the Ichthyophagi, see B. vii. c.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n[439] See the Notes at the end of this Book.\r\n\r\n[440] By descending the Indus, and going up the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[441] Near the mouth of the Indus, Hardouin says.\r\n\r\n[442] One of Alexander’s most distinguished officers, and a native of\r\nPella. He commanded the division of cavalry and light-armed troops\r\nwhich accompanied the fleet of Alexander down the Indus, along the\r\nright bank of the river. The Alexandria here mentioned does not appear\r\nto have been identified. It is not to be confounded with Alexandria\r\nin Arachosia, nor yet with a place of the same name in Carmania, the\r\nmodern Kerman.\r\n\r\n[443] A river Tomerus is spoken of by Arrian as lying between the Indus\r\nand the river Arabis or Arbis.\r\n\r\n[444] They seem to have dwelt along the shores of the modern Mukran,\r\nsouth of Beloochistan, and probably part of Kerman.\r\n\r\n[445] Called Nosala by Arrian. Ansart suggests that it is the island\r\nnow known by the name of Sengadip. It lay probably off the promontory\r\nor headland of the Sun, on the eastern coast of Arabia.\r\n\r\n[446] Mela suggests the reason, but gives to the island a different\r\nlocality—“over against the mouth of the Indus.” He says that the air of\r\nthe island is of such a nature as to take away life instantaneously,\r\nand appears to imply that the heat is the cause.\r\n\r\n[447] Possibly that now known as the Rud Shur.\r\n\r\n[448] Properly the “Seven Trions.”\r\n\r\n[449] The Persian kings, descendants of Achæmenes. He was said to have\r\nbeen reared by an eagle.\r\n\r\n[450] Called the Promontory of Harmozon by Strabo, Hardouin says that\r\nthe modern name is Cape Jash, but recent writers suggest that it is\r\nrepresented by the modern Cape Bombaruk, nearly opposite Cape Mussendom.\r\n\r\n[451] Perhaps the modern Kishon, at the entrance of the Persian Gulf;\r\nor that may be one of the four islands next mentioned.\r\n\r\n[452] The story of Pontoppidan’s Kraken or Korven, the serpent of the\r\nNorwegian Seas, is as old as Pliny, we find, and _he_ derived his\r\ninformation from older works.\r\n\r\n[453] Forbiger has suggested that this may be the same as the modern\r\nDjayrah.\r\n\r\n[454] Mentioned again in c. 29 of the present Book. Its modern name is\r\nPasa or Fasa-Kuri, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[455] Supposed to be the stream called by D’Anville and Thevenot the\r\nBoschavir, the river of Abushir or Busheer.\r\n\r\n[456] A river of ancient Susiana, the present name of which is Karun.\r\nPliny states, in c. 31 of the present Book, that the Eulæus flowed\r\nround the citadel of Susa; he mistakes it, however, for the Coprates,\r\nor, more strictly speaking, for a small stream now called the Shapúr\r\nriver, the ancient name of which has not been preserved. He is also\r\nin error, most probably, in making the river Eulæus flow through\r\nMessabatene, it being most likely the present Mah-Sabaden, in Laristan,\r\nwhich is drained by the Kerkbah, the ancient Choaspes, and not by the\r\nEulæus.\r\n\r\n[457] Called, for the sake of distinction, Charax Spasinu, originally\r\nfounded by Alexander the Great. It was afterwards destroyed by a flood,\r\nand rebuilt by Antiochus Epiphanes, under the name of Antiochia. It is\r\nmentioned in c. 31.\r\n\r\n[458] The Shushan of Scripture, now called Shu. It was the winter\r\nresidence of the kings of Persia, and stood in the district Cersia of\r\nthe province Susiana, on the eastern bank of the river Choaspes. The\r\nsite of Susa is now marked by extensive mounds.\r\n\r\n[459] The island of Patala or Patale, previously mentioned in c. 23.\r\n\r\n[460] Most probably the Cape Ras-el-Bad, the most easterly peninsula of\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\n[461] 35,000,000 francs, according to Ansart, which would amount to\r\n£1,400,000 of our money.\r\n\r\n[462] Pliny is the only writer that mentions this place among the\r\ntowns of Lower Egypt. Some suppose it to have been Nicopolis, or the\r\nCity of Victory, founded by Augustus B.C. 29, partly to commemorate\r\nthe reduction of Egypt to a Roman province, and partly to punish the\r\nAlexandrians for their adhesion to the cause of Antony and Cleopatra.\r\nMannert, however, looks upon it as having been merely that suburb of\r\nAlexandria which Strabo (B. xvii.) calls Eleusis.\r\n\r\n[463] From the Greek ὕδρευμα, a “watering-place.”\r\n\r\n[464] From Coptos, the modern Kouft or Keft. Ptolemy Philadelphus, when\r\nhe constructed the port of Berenice, erected several caravansaries or\r\nwatering-places between the new city and Coptos. Coptos was greatly\r\nenriched by the commerce between Lybia and Egypt on the one hand, and\r\nArabia and India on the other.\r\n\r\n[465] Belzoni found traces of several of the stations here mentioned.\r\nThe site of Berenice, as ascertained by Moresby and Carless, 1830-3,\r\nwas nearly at the bottom of the inlet known as the Sinus Immundus, or\r\nFoul Bay. Its ruins still exist.\r\n\r\n[466] Now called Gehla, a harbour and emporium at the south-western\r\npoint of Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n[467] An emporium or promontory on the southern coast of Arabia, in the\r\ncountry of the Adramitæ, and, as Arrian says, the chief port of the\r\nincense-bearing country. It has been identified by D’Anville with Cava\r\nCanim Bay, near a mountain called Hissan Ghorab, at the base of which\r\nthere are ruins to be seen.\r\n\r\n[468] Probably the modern Mosch, north of Mokha, near the southern\r\nextremity of Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n[469] Its ruins are now known as Dhafar. It was one of the chief cities\r\nof Arabia, standing near the southern coast of Arabia Felix, opposite\r\nthe modern Cape Guardafui.\r\n\r\n[470] Or Favonius, the west wind, previously mentioned in the present\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n[471] The modern Mangalore, according to Du Bocage.\r\n\r\n[472] Or canoes.\r\n\r\n[473] The Cottiara of Ptolemy, who makes it the chief city of the Æi, a\r\ntribe who occupied the lower part of the peninsula of Hindostan. It has\r\nbeen supposed to be represented by the modern Calicut or Travancore.\r\nCochin, however, appears to be the most likely.\r\n\r\n[474] Marcus observes that we may conclude that either Pliny or the\r\nauthor from whom he transcribed, wrote this between the years of the\r\nChristian era 48 and 51; for that the coincidence of the 6th of the\r\nmonth Mechir with the Ides of January, could not have taken place\r\nin any other year than those on which the first day of Thoth or the\r\nbeginning of the year fell on the 11th of August, which happened in the\r\nyears 48, 49, 50, and 51 of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[475] An extensive province of Asia, along the northern shores of the\r\nPersian Gulf, supposed to have comprehended the coast-line of the\r\nmodern Laristan, Kirman, and Moghostan.\r\n\r\n[476] Ptolemy mentions an inland town of Carmania of the same name.\r\n\r\n[477] Supposed to be that known now as the Ibrahim Rud, which falls\r\ninto the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[478] These sites are unknown.\r\n\r\n[479] Forms two bays or gulfs in succession.\r\n\r\n[480] He gives this name to the whole expanse of sea that lies between\r\nArabia and Africa on the west, and India on the east, including the Red\r\nSea and the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[481] Or Erythrus. In all probability entirely a mythical personage.\r\nThe sea having been called in Greek ἐρυθραῖα, or “red”—the legend most\r\nprobably thence took its rise. No very satisfactory reason has yet been\r\ngiven for its being so called. The Hebrew name of it signifies the\r\n“Sedgy Sea.”\r\n\r\n[482] From Azania in Æthiopia, mentioned again in c. 34 of the present\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[483] The maps appear to make it considerably more.\r\n\r\n[484] The only feature of resemblance appears to be its comparative\r\nnarrowness at the neck.\r\n\r\n[485] Or “turtle-eaters.”\r\n\r\n[486] Different probably from the Cophis mentioned in c. 25, which was\r\nalso called Arabius or Arbis, and probably represented by the modern\r\nPurali.\r\n\r\n[487] Of Harmozon, probably the modern Bombareek.\r\n\r\n[488] Their district is supposed to denote the vicinity of the modern\r\nOrmuz, an island off this coast, which is now known as Moghostan.\r\n\r\n[489] Taking their name probably from the river Arbis, previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[490] The “Port of the Macedonians.”\r\n\r\n[491] Now the Tab, falling into the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[492] A district of Susiana, extending from the river Eulæus on the\r\nwest, to the Oratis on the east, deriving its name perhaps from the\r\nElymæi, or Elymi, a warlike people found in the mountains of Greater\r\nMedia. In the Old Testament this country is called Elam.\r\n\r\n[493] Ptolemy says that this last bore the name of “Alexander’s Island.”\r\n\r\n[494] Persis was more properly a portion only or province of the\r\nancient kingdom of Persia. It gave name to the extensive Medo-Persian\r\nkingdom under Cyrus, the founder of the Persian empire, B.C. 559.\r\n\r\n[495] The Parthi originally inhabited the country south-east of the\r\nCaspian, now Khorassan. Under Arsaces and his descendants, Persis and\r\nthe other provinces of ancient Persia became absorbed in the great\r\nParthian empire. Parthia, with the Chorasmii, Sogdii, and Arii, formed\r\nthe sixteenth satrapy under the Persian empire. See c. 16 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[496] The provinces of Parthia have been already mentioned in detail in\r\nthe preceding Chapters, except Susiana and Elymais, which are mentioned\r\nin c. 31.\r\n\r\n[497] The original Parthia, the modern Khorassan.\r\n\r\n[498] The so-called Caucasian chain. See c. 16 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[499] Or “Wandering Parthians,” lying far to the east.\r\n\r\n[500] In c. 17 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[501] Not to be confounded with the place in Atropatene, mentioned in\r\nc. 21 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[502] It has been supposed that the modern Damgham corresponds with\r\nthis place, but that is too near the Portæ Caspiæ. It is considered\r\nmost probable that the remains of Hecatompylos ought to be sought in\r\nthe neighbourhood of a place now known as Jah Jirm. It is mentioned in\r\nc. 17 and 21 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[503] Media occupied the extreme west of the great table-land of the\r\nmodern Iran. It corresponded very nearly to the modern province of\r\nIrak-Ajemi.\r\n\r\n[504] The Upper and the Lower, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[505] Hardouin suggests that this should be Syrtibolos. His reasons for\r\nso thinking will be found alluded to in a note to c. 31. See p. 80,\r\nNote [593].\r\n\r\n[506] Or the “Great Ladder.” The Baron de Bode states, in his _Travels\r\nin Luristan and Arabistan_, that he discovered the remains of a\r\ngigantic causeway, in which he had no difficulty in recognizing one\r\nof the most ancient and most mysterious monuments of the East. This\r\ncauseway, which at the present day bears the name of Jaddehi-Atabeg, or\r\nthe “road of the Atabegs,” was looked upon by several historians as one\r\nof the wonders of the world, who gave it the name of the Climax Megale\r\nor “Great Ladder.” At the time even of Alexander the Great the name of\r\nits constructor was unknown.\r\n\r\n[507] Which was rebuilt after it was burnt by Alexander, and in\r\nthe middle ages had the name of Istakhar; it is now called Takhti\r\nJemsheed, the throne of Jemsheed, or Chil-Minar, the Forty Pillars. Its\r\nfoundation is sometimes ascribed to Cyrus the Great, but more generally\r\nto his son, Cambyses. The ruins of this place are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[508] Its site is unknown; but Dupinet translates it the “city of Lor.”\r\n\r\n[509] The older of the two capitals of Persia, Persepolis being the\r\nlater one. It was said to have been founded by Cyrus the Great, on\r\nthe spot where he gained his victory over Astyages. Its exact site\r\nis doubtful, but most modern geographers identify it with Murghab,\r\nto the north-east of Persepolis, where there are the remains of a\r\ngreat sepulchral monument of the ancient Persians, probably the tomb\r\nof Cyrus. Others place it at Farsa or at Dorab-Gherd, both to the\r\nsouth-east of Persepolis, the direction mentioned by Strabo, but not in\r\nother respects answering his description so well as Murghab.\r\n\r\n[510] It is most probable that he does not allude here to the Ecbatana,\r\nmentioned in c. 17 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[511] There were several mountainous districts called Parætacene in the\r\nPersian empire, that being the Greek form of a Persian word signifying\r\n“mountainous.”\r\n\r\n[512] In B. v. c. 21. He returns to the description of Susiana,\r\nElymaïs, and Characene in c. 31 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[513] The great seat of empire of the Babylonio-Chaldæan kingdom. It\r\neither occupied the site, it is supposed, or stood in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the tower of Babel. In the reign of Labynedus, Nabonnetus,\r\nor Belshazzar, it was taken by Cyrus. In the reign of Augustus, a\r\nsmall part only of Babylon was still inhabited, the remainder of the\r\nspace within the walls being under cultivation. The ruins of Babylon\r\nare found to commence a little south of the village of Mohawill, eight\r\nmiles north of Hillah.\r\n\r\n[514] Nineveh. See c. 16 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[515] On the left bank of the Euphrates, opposite to the ford of\r\nZeugma; a fortress of considerable importance.\r\n\r\n[516] Its site is unknown. Dupinet confounds it with the place of this\r\nname mentioned in the last Chapter, calling them by the name of Lor.\r\n\r\n[517] Pliny is wrong in placing Artemita in Mesopotamia. It was a city\r\nof Babylonia, in the district of Apolloniatis. The modern Sherbán is\r\nsupposed to occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[518] Burnouf, having found the name of these people, as he supposes,\r\nin a cuneiform inscription, written “Ayura,” would have them to be\r\ncalled Aroei. The Orei are also mentioned in B. v. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[519] This Antioch does not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[520] The mountains of the Gordyæi are mentioned in c. 12.\r\n\r\n[521] This, as previously mentioned in a Note to c. 16, was the scene\r\nof the last great battle between Alexander and Darius, and known as\r\nthe battle of Arbela. It has been suggested that it may perhaps be\r\nrepresented by a place now called Karnelis. See p. 27.\r\n\r\n[522] According to Ansart, now called the Lesser Zab, and by the\r\ninhabitants the Altun-su, meaning the “Golden river.”\r\n\r\n[523] According to Parisot, the modern name is Calicala.\r\n\r\n[524] Strabo speaks of the Aborras, or modern Khabur, as flowing in\r\nthe vicinity of Anthemusia, the district probably in which the town of\r\nAnthermis was situate. According to Isidorus of Charax, it lay between\r\nEdessa and the Euphrates. Its site does not appear to have been any\r\nfurther identified. It is called Anthemusia in B. v. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[525] In B. v. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[526] In B. v. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[527] In B. v. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[528] This canal, leading from the Euphrates to the Tigris, is by\r\nsome thought, according to Hardouin, to have been the river Chobar,\r\nmentioned in Ezekiel, c. i. v. 3.\r\n\r\n[529] For Arar-Melik, meaning the “River King,” according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[530] As to the identity of this, see a Note at the beginning of this\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n[531] Meaning Jupiter Uranius, or “Heavenly Jupiter,” according to\r\nParisot, who observes that Eusebius interprets _baal_, or _bel_,\r\n“heaven.” According to one account, he was the father of king Ninus and\r\nson of Nimrod. The Greeks in later times attached to his name many of\r\ntheir legendary fables.\r\n\r\n[532] The city of Seleucia ad Tigrin, long the capital of Western\r\nAsia, until it was eclipsed by Ctesiphon. Its site has been a matter\r\nof considerable discussion, but the most probable opinion is, that it\r\nstood on the western bank of the Tigris, to the north of its junction\r\nwith the royal canal (probably the river Chobar above mentioned),\r\nopposite to the mouth of the river Delas or Silla (now Diala), and\r\nto the spot where Ctesiphon was afterwards built by the Parthians.\r\nIt stood a little to the south of the modern city of Baghdad; thus\r\ncommanding the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, and the whole\r\nplain formed by those two rivers.\r\n\r\n[533] Ammianus, like Pliny, has ascribed its foundation to the\r\nParthians under Varanes, or Vardanes, of whom, however, nothing is\r\nknown. It stood in the south of Assyria, on the eastern or left bank of\r\nthe Tigris. Strabo speaks of it as being the winter residence of the\r\nParthian kings, who lived there at that season, owing to the mildness\r\nof the climate. In modern times the site of this place has been\r\nidentified with that called by the Arabs Al Madain, or the “two cities.”\r\n\r\n[534] Or Vologeses. This was the name of five kings of Parthia, of the\r\nrace of the Arsacidæ, Arsaces XXIII., XXVII., XXVIII., XXIX., XXX. It\r\nwas the first of these monarchs who founded the place here mentioned by\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\n[535] Or the “City of Vologesus;” _certa_ being the Armenian for “city.”\r\n\r\n[536] Nothing appears to be known of this place; but Hardouin thinks\r\nthat it is the same with one called Maarsares by Ptolemy, and situate\r\non the same river Narraga.\r\n\r\n[537] Parisot says that this river is the one set down in the maps as\r\nfalling into the Tigris below its junction with the Euphrates, and near\r\nthe mouths of the two rivers. He says that near the banks of it is\r\nmarked the town of Nabrahan, the Narraga of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[538] There is great doubt as to the correct spelling of these names.\r\n\r\n[539] Against the attacks of robbers dwelling on the opposite side; the\r\nAttali, for instance.\r\n\r\n[540] Or “dwellers in tents,” Bedouins, as we call them.\r\n\r\n[541] B. v. c. 20 and 21.\r\n\r\n[542] Towards Mahamedieh.\r\n\r\n[543] Near Antioch and the Orontes: now Seleukeh, or Kepse, near\r\nSuadeiah.\r\n\r\n[544] See B. v. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[545] The Mediterranean and the Red Sea; the latter including the\r\nmodern Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[546] Forbiger is of opinion that this is the same as the Didigua or\r\nDidugua of Ptolemy. It was situate below Alpamea. D’Anville takes it to\r\nbe the modern Corna.\r\n\r\n[547] The modern Turcomania.\r\n\r\n[548] Now known as the Plain of Chelat, according to Parisot, extending\r\nbetween Chelat, a city situate on a great lake and the river Rosso,\r\nfalling into the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n[549] Called Diglith by Josephus. Hardouin states that in his time the\r\nname given to the river by the natives was Daghela. This name is also\r\nsupposed to be another form of the Hiddekel of Scripture. See Genesis\r\nii. 14.\r\n\r\n[550] According to Bochart, this was a corruption of the Eastern name\r\nDeghel, from which were derived the forms Deger, Teger, and ultimately\r\nTigris.\r\n\r\n[551] Ritter has identified this with the modern lake Nazuk, in\r\nArmenia, about thirteen miles in length and five in breadth. The water\r\nat the present day is said to be sweet and wholesome.\r\n\r\n[552] Seneca, however, in his _Quæst. Nat._ B. vi., represents the\r\nTigris here as gradually drying up and becoming gradually smaller, till\r\nit disappears.\r\n\r\n[553] This spot is considered by Parisot to be the modern city of\r\nBetlis.\r\n\r\n[554] A spot where liquid bitumen or naphtha was found.\r\n\r\n[555] Or probably Arzarene, a province of the south of Armenia, situate\r\non the left bank of the Tigris. It derived its name from the lake\r\nArsene, or the town Arzen, situate on this lake. It is comprehended in\r\nthe modern Pashalik of Dyár Bekr.\r\n\r\n[556] Now called the Myrád-chaï. See B. v. c. 24. Ritter considers it\r\nto be the southern arm of the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[557] Or Aroei, as Littré suggests. See Note to c. 30 in p. 71.\r\n\r\n[558] See c. 17 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[559] The site of this place seems to be unknown. It has been remarked\r\nthat it is difficult to explain the meaning of this passage of Pliny,\r\nor to determine the probable site of Apamea.\r\n\r\n[560] Hardouin remarks that this is the right arm of the Tigris, by\r\nStephanus Byzantinus called Delas, and by Eustathius Sylax, which last\r\nhe prefers.\r\n\r\n[561] According to Ammianus, one of the names of Seleucia on the Tigris\r\nwas Coche.\r\n\r\n[562] A river of Susiana, which, after passing Susa, flowed into the\r\nTigris, below its junction with the Euphrates. The indistinctness of\r\nthe ancient accounts has caused it to be confused with the Eulæus,\r\nwhich flows nearly parallel with it into the Tigris. It is pretty\r\nclear that they were not identical. Pliny here states that they were\r\ndifferent rivers, but makes the mistake below, of saying that Susa was\r\nsituate upon the Eulæus, instead of the Choaspes. These errors may be\r\naccounted for, it has been suggested, by the fact that there are two\r\nconsiderable rivers which unite at Bund-i-Kir, a little above Ahwaz,\r\nand form the ancient Pasitigris or modern Karun. It is supposed that\r\nthe Karun represents the ancient Eulæus, and the Kerkhah the Choaspes.\r\n\r\n[563] In c. 26 of the present Book. The custom of the Persian kings\r\ndrinking only of the waters of the Eulæus and Choaspes, is mentioned in\r\nB. xxxi. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[564] Or the country “by the river.”\r\n\r\n[565] Pliny is the only writer who makes mention of this place. Parisot\r\nis of opinion that it is represented by the modern Digil-Ab, on the\r\nTigris, and suggests that Digilath may be the correct reading.\r\n\r\n[566] Mentioned in the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[567] Now called the Mountains of Luristan.\r\n\r\n[568] The name of the district of Chalonitis is supposed to be still\r\npreserved in that of the river of Holwan. Pliny is thought, however, to\r\nhave been mistaken in placing the district on the river Tigris, as it\r\nlay to the east of it, and close to the mountains.\r\n\r\n[569] From Arbela, in Assyria, which bordered on it.\r\n\r\n[570] A great and populous city of Babylonia, near the Tigris, but\r\nnot on it, and eight parasangs within the Median wall. The site is\r\nthat probably now called Eski Baghdad, and marked by a ruin called the\r\nTower of Nimrod. Parisot cautions against confounding it with a place\r\nof a similar name, mentioned by Pliny in B. xii. c. 17, a mistake into\r\nwhich, he says, Hardouin has fallen.\r\n\r\n[571] Now called Felongia, according to Parisot. Hardouin considers it\r\nthe same as the Sambana of Diodorus Siculus, which Parisot looks upon\r\nas the same as Ambar, to the north of Felongia.\r\n\r\n[572] Of this Antiochia nothing appears to be known. By some it has\r\nbeen supposed to be the same with Apollonia, the chief town of the\r\ndistrict of Apolloniatis, to the south of the district of Arbela.\r\n\r\n[573] Also called the Physcus, the modern Ordoneh, an eastern tributary\r\nof the Tigris in Lower Assyria. The town of Opis stood at its junction\r\nwith the Tigris.\r\n\r\n[574] D’Anville supposes that this Apamea was at the point where the\r\nDijeil, now dry, branched off from the Tigris, which bifurcation\r\nhe places near Samurrah. Lynch, however, has shown that the Dijeil\r\nbranched off near Jibbarah, a little north of 34° North lat., and\r\nthinks that the Dijeil once swept the end of the Median wall, and\r\nflowed between it and Jebbarah. Possibly this is the Apamea mentioned\r\nby Pliny in c. 27.\r\n\r\n[575] The son of Seleucus Nicator.\r\n\r\n[576] More to the south, and nearer the sea.\r\n\r\n[577] Previously mentioned in c. 26.\r\n\r\n[578] A part of Mount Zagrus, previously mentioned, according to\r\nHardouin.\r\n\r\n[579] Its site appears to be unknown. According to Stephanus, it was\r\na city of Persia. Forbiger conjectures that it is the same place as\r\nBadaca, mentioned by Diodorus Siculus, B. xix. c. 19; but that was\r\nprobably nearer to Susa.\r\n\r\n[580] The buryer excepted, perhaps.\r\n\r\n[581] In c. 28 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[582] As mentioned in c. 26 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[583] A warlike tribe on the borders of Susiana and the Greater Media.\r\nIn character they are thought to have resembled the Bakhtiara tribes,\r\nwho now roam over the mountains which they formerly inhabited. It has\r\nbeen suggested that their name may possibly be connected with the\r\nmodern Khuzistan.\r\n\r\n[584] Supposed to be the same as the modern Kirmánshah mountains.\r\n\r\n[585] As mentioned in a previous Note, (67 in p. 77), Pliny mistakes\r\nthe Eulæus for the Choaspes. In c. 26 he says that Susa is on the river\r\nTigris.\r\n\r\n[586] Pliny says this in B. xxxi. c. 21 of both the Eulæus and the\r\nChoaspes.\r\n\r\n[587] Most probably the Hedyphon of Strabo, supposed to be the same as\r\nthat now called the Djerrabi.\r\n\r\n[588] Parisot thinks that this is the modern Jessed, in the vicinity of\r\nthe desert of Bealbanet.\r\n\r\n[589] Previously mentioned in c. 28.\r\n\r\n[590] The modern Tab.\r\n\r\n[591] Now called Camata, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[592] The modern Saurac, according to Parisot. The more general reading\r\nis “Sosirate.”\r\n\r\n[593] Our author has nowhere made any such statement as this, for which\r\nreason Hardouin thinks that he here refers to the maritime region\r\nmentioned in c. 29 of the present Book (p. 69), the name of which\r\nSillig reads as Ciribo. Hardouin would read it as Syrtibolos, and would\r\ngive it the meaning of the “muddy district of the Syrtes.” It is more\r\nlikely, however, that Pliny has made a slip, and refers to something\r\nwhich, by inadvertence, he has omitted to mention.\r\n\r\n[594] Charax Spasinu, or Pasinu, previously mentioned in c. 26 (see p.\r\n62). The name Charax applied to a town, seems to have meant a fortified\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[595] Called “Eudæmon” by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[596] The Great, the father of Antiochus Epiphanes.\r\n\r\n[597] Though this passage is probably corrupt, the reading employed\r\nby Sillig is inadmissible, as it makes nothing but nonsense. “Et jam\r\nVipsanda porticus habet;” “and even now, Vipsanda has its porticos.”\r\n\r\n[598] Dionysius of Charax. No particulars of him are known beyond those\r\nmentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[599] Caius, the son of Marcus Agrippa and Julia, the daughter of\r\nAugustus. He was the adopted son of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[600] See B. iii. c. 1, p. 151, in vol. 1.\r\n\r\n[601] In B. v. c. 21 and 22.\r\n\r\n[602] Who called himself the King of kings, and was finally conquered\r\nby Pompey.\r\n\r\n[603] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[604] See B. v. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[605] Salmasius thinks that this should be written “Nombei;” but\r\nHardouin remarks that the Nombæi were not of Arabian but Jewish\r\nextraction, and far distant from Mount Libanus.\r\n\r\n[606] The only resemblance between them is, that each is a peninsula;\r\nthat of Arabia being of far greater extent than Italy. It will be\r\nremarked that here, contrary to his ordinary practice, Pliny makes a\r\ndistinction between the Red Sea and the Persian Sea or Gulf.\r\n\r\n[607] “In eandem etiam cœli partem nulla differentia spectat.” A glance\r\nat the map will at once show the fallacy of this assertion.\r\n\r\n[608] In B. v. c. 12 and 21.\r\n\r\n[609] In c. 30 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[610] Mentioned in B. v. c. 21, if, indeed, that is the same Petra.\r\n\r\n[611] Omana or Omanum was their chief place, a port on the north-east\r\ncoast of Arabia Felix, a little above the promontory of Syagros,\r\nnow Ras el Had, on a large gulf of the same name. The name is still\r\npreserved in the modern name Oman.\r\n\r\n[612] In Sitacene, mentioned in the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[613] Or rather, as Hardouin says, the shore opposite to Charax, and on\r\nthe western bank of the river.\r\n\r\n[614] Called Core Boobian, a narrow salt-water channel, laid down for\r\nthe first time in the East India Company’s chart, and separating a\r\nlarge low island, off the mouth of the old bed of the Euphrates, from\r\nthe mainland.\r\n\r\n[615] The great headland on the coast of Arabia, at the entrance of the\r\nbay of Doat-al-Kusma from the south, opposite to Pheleche Island.\r\n\r\n[616] This is the line of coast extending from the great headland last\r\nmentioned to the river Khadema, the ancient Achenus.\r\n\r\n[617] So called from the city of Arabia Felix, built on its shores.\r\nStrabo says of this city, “The city of Gerra lies in a deep gulf, where\r\nChaldæan exiles from Babylon inhabit a salt country, having houses\r\nbuilt of salt, the walls of which, when they are wasted by the heat of\r\nthe sun, are repaired by copious applications of sea-water.” D’Anville\r\nfirst identified this place with the modern El Khatiff. Niebuhr finds\r\nits site on the modern Koneit of the Arabs, called “Gran” by the\r\nPersians; but Foster is of opinion that he discovered its ruins in the\r\nEast India Company’s Chart, situate where all the ancient authorities\r\nhad placed it, at the end of the deep and narrow bay at the mouth of\r\nwhich are situated the islands of Bahrein. The gulf mentioned by Pliny\r\nis identified by Foster with that of Bahrein.\r\n\r\n[618] The modern island of Bahrein, according to Brotier, still famous\r\nfor its pearl-fishery.\r\n\r\n[619] Now Samaki, according to Ansart. Its ancient name was Aradus.\r\n\r\n[620] Hardouin takes this to be that which by the Arabians is called by\r\nthe name of Falg.\r\n\r\n[621] On the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[622] Considered by modern geographers to be identical in situation\r\nwith the Black Mountains and the Cape of Asabi, and still marked by a\r\ntown and district named Sabee, close to Cape Mussendom.\r\n\r\n[623] In the modern district still called Oman.\r\n\r\n[624] On the opposite coast.\r\n\r\n[625] He calls it Canis, evidently thinking that “Cynos” was its Greek\r\nappellation only: as meaning the “Dogs’” river.\r\n\r\n[626] Or the mountain “with the Three Peaks.”\r\n\r\n[627] Stephanus mentions this as an island of the Erythræan Sea. Hardly\r\nany of these places appear to have been identified; and there is great\r\nuncertainty as to the orthography of the names.\r\n\r\n[628] From which came the myrrh mentioned by Pliny in B. xii. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[629] Or the Tent-Dwellers, the modern Bedouins.\r\n\r\n[630] By some geographers identified with the Ocelis or Ocila,\r\nmentioned in c. 26, the present Zee Hill or Ghela, a short distance to\r\nthe south of Mocha, and to the north of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.\r\nHardouin says, however, that it was a different place, Acila being in\r\nthe vicinity of the Persian Gulf, in which he appears to be correct.\r\n\r\n[631] Nothing relative to Numenius beyond this fact has been recorded.\r\n\r\n[632] Hardouin and Ansart think that under this name is meant the\r\nisland called in modern times Mazira or Maceira.\r\n\r\n[633] There seem to have been three mythical personages of this name;\r\nbut it appears impossible to distinguish the one from the other.\r\n\r\n[634] Or “Dioscoridis Insula,” an island of the Indian Ocean, of\r\nconsiderable importance as an emporium or mart, in ancient times.\r\nIt lay between the Syagrus Promontorium, in Arabia, and Aromata\r\nPromontorium, now Cape Guardafui, on the opposite coast of Africa,\r\nsomewhat nearer to the former, according to Arrian, which cannot be the\r\ncase if it is rightly identified with Socotorra, 200 miles distant from\r\nthe Arabian coast, and 110 from the north-east promontory of Africa.\r\n\r\n[635] So called from Azania, or Barbaria, now Ajan, south of Somauli,\r\non the mainland of Africa.\r\n\r\n[636] Now Cape Fartash, in Arabia.\r\n\r\n[637] Their country is supposed to have been the Sheba of Scripture,\r\nthe queen of which visited king Solomon. It was situate in the\r\nsouth-western corner of Arabia Felix, the north and centre of the\r\nprovince of Yemen, though the geographers before Ptolemy seem to give\r\nit a still wider extent, quite to the south of Yemen. The Sabæi most\r\nprobably spread originally on both sides of the southern part of the\r\nRed Sea, the shores of Arabia and Africa. Their capital was Saba,\r\nin which, according to their usage, their king was confined a close\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n[638] The Persian Gulf to the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[639] The modern district of Hadramaut derives its name from this\r\npeople, who were situate on the coast of the Red Sea to the east of\r\nAden. Sabota, their capital, was a great emporium for their drugs and\r\nspices.\r\n\r\n[640] Still known as Mareb, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[641] Hardouin is doubtful as to this name, and thinks that it ought to\r\nbe Elaïtæ, or else Læanitæ, the people again mentioned below.\r\n\r\n[642] A name which looks very much like “fraud,” or “cheating,” as\r\nHardouin observes, from the Greek ἀπάτη.\r\n\r\n[643] Off the Promontory of Ras-el-Had.\r\n\r\n[644] Probably in the district now known as Akra. It was situate on the\r\neastern coast of the Red Sea, at the foot of Mount Hippus.\r\n\r\n[645] See B. v. c. 12, where this town is mentioned.\r\n\r\n[646] Whose chief city was Petra, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[647] Supposed by some writers to have been the ancestors of the\r\nSaracens, so famous in the earlier part of the middle ages. Some of the\r\nMSS., indeed, read “Sarraceni.”\r\n\r\n[648] Their town is called Arra by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[649] Their district is still called Thamud, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[650] Still called Cariatain, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[651] A ridiculous fancy, probably founded solely on the similarity of\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\n[652] A story as probable, Hardouin observes, as that about the\r\ndescendants of Minos.\r\n\r\n[653] The Arabs of Yemen, known in Oriental history by the name of\r\nHimyari, were called by the Greeks Homeritæ.\r\n\r\n[654] An inland city, called Masthala by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[655] Agatharchides speaks of a town on the sea coast, which was so\r\ncalled from the multitude of ducks found there. The one here spoken of\r\nwas in the interior, and cannot be the same.\r\n\r\n[656] Hardouin observes, that neither this word, nor the name\r\nRiphearma, above mentioned, has either a Hebrew or an Arabian origin.\r\n\r\n[657] Probably the same place as we find spoken of by Herodotus as\r\nAmpe, and at which Darius settled a colony of Miletians after the\r\ncapture of Miletus, B.C. 494.\r\n\r\n[658] Hardouin remarks that Mariaba, the name found in former editions,\r\nhas no such meaning in the modern Arabic.\r\n\r\n[659] Mentioned by Ovid in the Metamorphoses, B. v. l. 165, _et seq._\r\nSillig, however, reads “Ciani.”\r\n\r\n[660] An intimate friend of the geographer Strabo. He was prefect of\r\nEgypt during part of the reign of Augustus, and in the years B.C. 24\r\nand 25. Many particulars have been given by Strabo of his expedition\r\nagainst Arabia, in which he completely failed. The heat of the sun,\r\nthe badness of the water, and the want of the necessaries of life,\r\ndestroyed the greater part of his army.\r\n\r\n[661] By adoption, as previously stated.\r\n\r\n[662] The town of the Calingii, mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[663] Or wandering tribes.\r\n\r\n[664] Its uses in medicine are stated at length in the last Chapter of\r\nB. xxi.\r\n\r\n[665] Another form of the name of Atramitæ previously mentioned, the\r\nancient inhabitants of the part of Arabia known as Hadramant, and\r\nsettled, as is supposed, by the descendants of the Joctanite patriarch\r\nHazarmaveth.\r\n\r\n[666] Arabia at the present day yields no gold, and very little silver.\r\nThe queen of Sheba is mentioned as bringing gold to Solomon, _1 Kings_,\r\nx. 2, _2 Chron._ ix. i. Artemidorus and Diodorus Siculus make mention,\r\non the Arabian Gulf, of the Debæ, the Alilæi, and the Gasandi, in whose\r\nterritories native gold was found. These last people, who did not know\r\nits value, were in the habit of bringing it to their neighbours, the\r\nSabæi, and exchanging it for articles of iron and copper.\r\n\r\n[667] B. xii.\r\n\r\n[668] The “mitra,” which was a head-dress especially used by the\r\nPhrygians, was probably of varied shape, and may have been the early\r\nform of the eastern turban.\r\n\r\n[669] The Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.\r\n\r\n[670] Or Heroöpolis, a city east of the Delta, in Egypt, and situate\r\nnear the mouth of the royal canal which connected the Nile with the\r\nRed Sea. It was of considerable consequence as a trading station upon\r\nthe arm of the Red Sea, which runs up as far as Arsinoë, the modern\r\nSuez, and was called the “Gulf” or “Bay of the Heroes.” The ruins of\r\nHeroöpolis are still visible at Abu-Keyscheid.\r\n\r\n[671] This place, as here implied, took its name from Cambyses, the son\r\nof Cyrus.\r\n\r\n[672] In c. 9 of the preceding Book. “Dictum,” however, may only mean,\r\n“called” the Delta.\r\n\r\n[673] Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Tzetzes, mention this, not with\r\nreference to Sesostris, but Necho, the grandson of Sesostris.\r\n\r\n[674] Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of Ptolemy Soter, or Lagides.\r\n\r\n[675] Now known by the name of Scheib. They derived their name from\r\nthe saline flavour and deposition of their waters. These springs were\r\nstrongly impregnated with alkaline salts, and with muriate of lime\r\nwashed from the rocks which separated the Delta from the Red Sea.\r\nThe salt which they produced being greatly valued, they were on that\r\naccount regarded as the private property of the kings.\r\n\r\n[676] The “not thirsty” route, so called by way of antiphrasis.\r\n\r\n[677] See B. v. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[678] In c. 26 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[679] Or “narrow necks,” apparently, from the Greek στηναὶ δειραὶ. If\r\nthis be the correct reading, they were probably so called from the\r\nnarrow strait which ran between them.\r\n\r\n[680] An island called Halonnesus has been already mentioned in B. iv.\r\nc. 23. None of these islands appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[681] See B. xxxvii. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[682] This seems to be the meaning, though, literally translated, it\r\nwould be, “These were the prefects of kings.”\r\n\r\n[683] It obtained this title of πάγχρυσος, or “all golden,” from its\r\nvicinity to the gold mines of Jebel Allaki, or Ollaki, from which the\r\nancient Egyptians drew their principal supply of that metal, and in the\r\nworking of which they employed criminals and prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n[684] Or ἐπὶ δειρῆς, “upon the neck.” It was situate on the western\r\nside of the Red Sea, near the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.\r\n\r\n[685] Ansart suggests that the modern island of Mehun is here meant.\r\nGosselin is of opinion that Pliny is in error in mentioning two islands\r\nin the Red Sea as producing the topaz.\r\n\r\n[686] Called Theron, as well as Epitheras. It was an emporium on the\r\ncoast of the Red Sea for the trade with India and Arabia. It was\r\nchiefly remarkable for its position in mathematical geography, as, the\r\nsun having been observed to be directly over it forty-five days before\r\nand after the summer solstice, the place was taken as one of the points\r\nfor determining the length of a degree of a great circle on the earth’s\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[687] From the Greek ἐπὶ θήρας, “for hunting.”\r\n\r\n[688] In B. ii. c. 75.\r\n\r\n[689] In the same Chapter.\r\n\r\n[690] So called from Azania, the adjoining coast of Africa, now known\r\nas that of Ajan. It was inhabited by a race of Æthiopians, who were\r\nengaged in catching and taming elephants, and supplying the markets of\r\nthe Red Sea coast with hides and ivory.\r\n\r\n[691] Now called Seyrman, according to Gosselin.\r\n\r\n[692] Its name was Adule, being the chief haven of the Adulitæ, of\r\nmixed origin, in the Troglodytic region, situate on a bay of the Red\r\nSea, called Aduliticus Sinus. It is generally supposed that the modern\r\nThulla or Zulla, still pronounced Azoole, occupies its site, being\r\nsituate in lat. 15° 35′ N. Ruins are said to exist there. D’Anville,\r\nhowever, in his map of the Red Sea, places Adule at Arkeeko, on the\r\nsame coast, and considerably to the north of Thulla. According to\r\nCosmas, Adule was about two miles in the interior.\r\n\r\n[693] Pliny gives a further description of this ape in B. viii. c. 21.,\r\nand B. x. c. 72. They were much valued by the Roman ladies for pets,\r\nand very high prices were given for them.\r\n\r\n[694] Now called Dahal-Alley, according to Gosselin.\r\n\r\n[695] Hardouin, from Strabo, suggests that the reading ought to be\r\nCoracios.\r\n\r\n[696] The “False Gates.”\r\n\r\n[697] The “Gates.”\r\n\r\n[698] D’Anville and Gosselin think that this is the island known as the\r\nFrench Island.\r\n\r\n[699] Ansart thinks that this promontory is that known as Cape de Meta,\r\nand that the port is at the mouth of the little river called Soul or\r\nSoal.\r\n\r\n[700] In his Æthiopian expedition. According to Strabo, he had altars\r\nand pillars erected there to record it.\r\n\r\n[701] Under the impression entertained by the ancients, that the\r\nsouthern progress of the coast of Africa stopped short here, and that\r\nit began at this point to trend away gradually to the north-west.\r\n\r\n[702] Coro. Salmasius seems with justice, notwithstanding the censures\r\nof Hardouin, to have found considerable difficulty in this passage. If\r\nit is Pliny’s meaning that by sea round the south of the Promontory\r\nof Mossylum there is a passage to the extreme north-western point of\r\nAfrica, it is pretty clear that it is not by the aid of a north-west\r\nwind that it could be reached. “Euro,” “with a south-east wind,” has\r\nbeen very properly suggested.\r\n\r\n[703] By this name he means the Æthiopian Troglodytæ. Of course it\r\nwould be absurd to attempt any identification of the places here named,\r\nas they must clearly have existed only in the imagination of the\r\nAfrican geographer.\r\n\r\n[704] The supposed commencement of the Atlantic, to the west of the\r\nPromontory of Mossylum.\r\n\r\n[705] From the Greek ἀσκὸς, a “bladder,” or “inflated skin.” It is not\r\nimprobable that the story as to their mode of navigation is derived\r\nonly from the fancied origin of their name.\r\n\r\n[706] Apparently meaning in the Greek the “jackal-hunters,” θηροθῶες.\r\nFor an account of this animal, see B. viii. c. 52, and B. xv. c. 95.\r\n\r\n[707] Heliopolis, described in B. v. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[708] Considering it as part of Asia.\r\n\r\n[709] Conformably with the usage of modern geographers, and, one would\r\nalmost think, with that of common sense.\r\n\r\n[710] Of the river Nile.\r\n\r\n[711] As to Syene and the Catadupi, see B. v. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[712] This place was also called in later times Contrapselcis. It was\r\nsituate in the Dodecaschœnus, the part of Æthiopia immediately above\r\nEgypt, on an island near the eastern bank of the river, a little above\r\nPselcis, which stood on the opposite bank. It has been suggested that\r\nthis may have been the modern island of Derar. The other places do not\r\nappear to have been identified, and, in fact, in no two of the MSS. do\r\nthe names appear to agree.\r\n\r\n[713] Or the “Great Wall.”\r\n\r\n[714] Meaning, “the people who live in seventy villages.”\r\n\r\n[715] Or western side of the Nile, between Syene and Meroë.\r\n\r\n[716] Ὕπατον, the “supreme,” or perhaps the “last.”\r\n\r\n[717] Dion Cassius also mentions this expedition. From Seneca we learn\r\nthat Nero dispatched two centurions to make inquiry into the sources of\r\nthe Nile.\r\n\r\n[718] Dion Cassius calls him Caius Petronius. He carried on the war in\r\nB.C. 22 against the Æthiopians, who had invaded Egypt under their queen\r\nCandace. He took many of their towns.\r\n\r\n[719] Du Bocage is of opinion that this place stood not far from the\r\npresent Ibrim.\r\n\r\n[720] Supposed by Du Bocage to have stood in the vicinity of the modern\r\nDongola.\r\n\r\n[721] He was clearly a mythical personage, and nothing certain is known\r\nwith respect to him. Tombs of Memnon were shown in several places, as\r\nat Ptolemais in Syria, on the Hellespont, on a hill near the mouth of\r\nthe river Æsepus, near Palton in Syria, in Æthiopia, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[722] Her story has been alluded to in the account of Joppa, B. v. c.\r\n34. Cepheus, the father of Andromeda, though possessing the coasts of\r\nSyria, was fabled to have been king of Æthiopia.\r\n\r\n[723] See B. v. c. 10, where Meroë is also mentioned.\r\n\r\n[724] Or the sacred “sycamore tree.”\r\n\r\n[725] Situate beyond the Great Cataract, and on the western bank.\r\n\r\n[726] See the Notes to the preceding Chapter, in p. 95.\r\n\r\n[727] Or dog’s-headed ape, described in B. viii. c. 80. It is supposed\r\nto be the baboon.\r\n\r\n[728] Hesychius says that it was also called Aëria, probably from the\r\ntime of its king Ægyptus, who was called Aërius.\r\n\r\n[729] “Ubi desiimus.” This appears to be a preferable reading to “ubi\r\ndesinit,” adopted by Sillig, and apparently referring to the river\r\nNile. It is not improbable that our author here alludes, as Hardouin\r\nsays, to his words in the preceding Chapter, “Hinc in ora Æthiopiæ,”\r\n&c. See p. 96.\r\n\r\n[730] Ansart thinks that the country of this people was the modern\r\nKordofan. This, however, could not be the case, if the Macrobii,\r\n_opposite_ to them, dwelt on the African side of the river.\r\n\r\n[731] Or “long-livers.”\r\n\r\n[732] Mentioned again in c. 2 of the next Book.\r\n\r\n[733] Who is mentioned again in B. xxxvi. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[734] Ptolemy, however, speaks of Esar and Daron as the names of towns\r\nsituate on the island of Meroë.\r\n\r\n[735] On the eastern side of the Nile, and bearing no reference, as\r\nHardouin remarks, to the people of modern Nubia.\r\n\r\n[736] There is considerable doubt as to the correctness of these names,\r\nas they are differently spelt in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[737] Marcus thinks that these mountains are those which lie to the\r\nwest of the Nile, in Darfour, and Dar-Sale, or Dizzela, mentioned by\r\nSalt, in his _Travels in Abyssinia_.\r\n\r\n[738] From this it would appear that Pliny, with Dalion, supposed that\r\nthe Nile ran down to the southern ocean, and then took a turn along the\r\ncoast in a westerly direction; the shore being skirted by Syrtes, or\r\nquicksands, similar to those in the north of Africa.\r\n\r\n[739] So called from the Greek—“Eaters of wild beasts.”\r\n\r\n[740] The “all-eaters.”\r\n\r\n[741] Or the “livers on the milk of the dog.”\r\n\r\n[742] In c. 8 of the preceding Book.\r\n\r\n[743] They were thence called by the Greeks “Acridophagi.” According\r\nto Agatharchides, these people dwelt in what is modern Nubia, where\r\nBurkhardt found the people subsisting on lizards.\r\n\r\n[744] Hardouin remarks, that the length is measured from south-east to\r\nsouth-west; and the breadth from south to north.\r\n\r\n[745] The supposed Southern Ocean, which joins the Atlantic on the west.\r\n\r\n[746] Or the “Chariot of the gods,” mentioned also in Book ii. c. 110,\r\nand B. v. c. 1. It is supposed to have been some portion of the Atlas\r\nchain; but the subject is involved in the greatest obscurity.\r\n\r\n[747] Or the “Western Horn.” It is not known whether this was Cape de\r\nVerde, or Cape Roxo. Ansart thinks that it is the same as Cape Non. It\r\nis mentioned in c. 1 of B. v. as the “promontorium Hesperium.”\r\n\r\n[748] See notes to B. v. c. 1, in vol. i. p. 378.\r\n\r\n[749] Marcus says that these islands are those called the “Two\r\nSisters,” situate to the west of the Isle of Socotra, on the coast of\r\nAfrica. They are called by Ptolemy, Cocionati.\r\n\r\n[750] The position of this island has been much discussed by\r\ngeographers, as being intimately connected with the subject of Hanno’s\r\nvoyage to the south of Africa. Gosselin, who carries that voyage no\r\nfurther south than Cape Non, in about 28° north lat., identifies Cerne\r\nwith Fedallah, on the coast of Fez, which, however, is probably much\r\ntoo far to the north. Major Rennell places it as far south as Arguin,\r\na little to the south of the southern Cape Blanco, in about 20° 5′\r\nNorth latitude. Heeren, Mannert, and others, adopt the intermediate\r\nportion of Agadir, or Souta Cruz, on the coast of Morocco, just below\r\nCape Ghir, the termination of the main chain of the Atlas. If we are to\r\ntrust to Pliny’s statement, it is pretty clear that nothing certain was\r\nknown about it in his day.\r\n\r\n[751] The “Pillars.” Marcus thinks that these were some small islands\r\nnear the Isle of Socotra.\r\n\r\n[752] Hardouin says that this is not the Atlantis rendered so famous\r\nby Plato, whose story is distantly referred to in B. ii. c. 92 of this\r\nwork. It is difficult to say whether the Atlantis of Plato had any\r\nexistence at all, except in the imagination.\r\n\r\n[753] Medusa and her sisters, the daughters of Phorcys and Ceto. The\r\nidentity of their supposed islands seems not to have been ascertained.\r\nFor the poetical aspect of their story, see Ovid’s Met., B. iv.\r\n\r\n[754] It is not improbable that these were the skins of a species of\r\nuran-outang, or large monkey.\r\n\r\n[755] The Purpurariæ, or “Purple Islands,” probably the Madeira group.\r\n\r\n[756] Or Islands of the Blessed—the modern Canaries.\r\n\r\n[757] Supposed to be the modern island of Fuerteventura.\r\n\r\n[758] Supposed to be that now called Ferro.\r\n\r\n[759] Probably the modern Gomera. In B. iv. c. 36, Pliny mentions them\r\nas six in number, there being actually seven.\r\n\r\n[760] He does not appear on this occasion to reckon those already\r\nmentioned as belonging to the group of the Fortunatæ Insulæ.\r\n\r\n[761] The present Isle of Teneriffe.\r\n\r\n[762] Supposed to be that now called Gran Canaria.\r\n\r\n[763] The smoothness of its surface.\r\n\r\n[764] It is impossible to see clearly what he means. Littré says that\r\nit has been explained by some to mean, that from the Purpurariæ,\r\nor Madeira Islands, it is a course of 250 miles to the west to the\r\nFortunatæ or Canary Islands; but that to return from the Fortunatæ\r\nto the Purpurariæ, required a more circuitous route in an easterly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n[765] Or Pluvialia, the Rainy Island, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[766] Salmasius thinks that the sugar-cane is here alluded to. Hardouin\r\nsays that in Ferro there still grows a tree of this nature, known as\r\nthe “holy tree.”\r\n\r\n[767] Or the Lesser Junonia; supposed to be the same as the modern\r\nLanzarote.\r\n\r\n[768] Or “Snow Island,” the same as that previously called Invallis,\r\nthe modern Teneriffe, with its snow-capped peak.\r\n\r\n[769] So called from its canine inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[770] As to the silurus, see B. ix. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[771] Hardouin takes this to mean, both as to the continent, with the\r\nplaces there situate, and the seas, with the islands there found;\r\nthe continent being the interior, and the seas the exterior part. It\r\nis much more likely, however, that his description of the _interior_\r\nof the earth is that given in the 2nd Book, while the account of the\r\nexterior is set forth in the geographical notices contained in the 3rd,\r\n4th, 5th, and 6th.\r\n\r\n[772] The Straits of Gades or Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[773] The Straits of Gades.\r\n\r\n[774] Littré has the following remark: “Is it possible that Pliny can\r\nhave imagined that the extent of a surface could be ascertained by\r\nadding the length to the breadth?” It is just possible that such may\r\nnot have been his meaning; but it seems quite impossible to divine what\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n[775] He means to say that the interior is not inhabited beyond a\r\ndistance of 250 miles from the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n[776] See B. v. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[777] He is probably speaking only of that part of Asia which included\r\nEgypt, on the eastern side of the river Nile, according to ancient\r\ngeography. His mode, however, of reckoning the breadth of Asia, _i. e._\r\nfrom south to north, is singular. See p. 104.\r\n\r\n[778] On a rough calculation, these aliquot parts in all would make\r\n42643/42900 parts of the unit. It is not improbable that the figures\r\ngiven above as the dimensions are incorrect, as they do not agree with\r\nthe fractional results here given by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[779] B. iv. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[780] In p. 111.\r\n\r\n[781] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[782] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[783] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[784] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[785] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[786] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[787] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[788] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[789] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[790] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[791] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[792] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[793] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[794] The famous Roman historian, a native of Padua. He died at his\r\nnative town, in the year A.D. 17, aged 76. Of his Annals, composed in\r\n142, only 35 Books have come down to us.\r\n\r\n[795] L. Annæus Seneca, the Roman philosopher and millionnaire. He was\r\nput to death by Nero.\r\n\r\n[796] P. Nigidius Figulus, a Roman senator, and Pythagorean\r\nphilosopher, skilled in astrology and other sciences. He was so\r\ncelebrated for his knowledge, that Aulus Gellius pronounces him, next\r\nto Varro, the most learned of the Romans. He was an active partisan of\r\nPompey, and was compelled by Cæsar to live at a distance from Rome. He\r\ndied in exile, B.C. 44. There is a letter of consolation addressed to\r\nhim by Cicero in his Epistles “ad Familiares,” which contains a warm\r\ntribute to his worth and learning.\r\n\r\n[797] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[798] For Hecatæus of Miletus, see end of B. iv. Hecatæus of Abdera\r\nwas a contemporary of Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Lagides. He is\r\nthought to have accompanied the former in his Asiatic expedition as\r\nfar as Syria. He was a pupil of the sceptic Pyrrho, and is called a\r\nphilosopher, critic, and grammarian. He was the author of a History of\r\nEgypt, a work on the Hyperborei, and a History of the Jews.\r\n\r\n[799] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[800] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[801] For Eudoxus of Cnidos, see end of B. ii. Eudoxus of Cyzicus\r\nwas a geographer and a native of Egypt, who was employed by Ptolemy\r\nEuergetes and his wife Cleopatra in voyages to India. He made attempts\r\nto circumnavigate Africa by sailing to the south, but without success.\r\nHe is supposed to have lived about B.C. 130. See B. ii. c. 67 of the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\n[802] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[803] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[804] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[805] He commanded the fleets of Ptolemy Philadelphia, and of Seleucus\r\nNicator, by whose orders he paid a visit to the coasts of India. Strabo\r\nspeaks of his account of India as the best guide to the geography of\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\n[806] A native of Miletus—see the tenth Chapter of this Book. He\r\nappears to have written a geographical work on Asia, from which Pliny\r\nderived considerable assistance.\r\n\r\n[807] Son of Deinon, the historian; he accompanied Alexander in his\r\nAsiatic expedition, and wrote a history of it. Quintus Curtius censures\r\nhim for his inaccuracy. Cicero, Quintilian, and Longinus, also speak in\r\nslighting terms of his performance.\r\n\r\n[808] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[809] He alludes to the letters of that monarch, and the journals\r\nwhich were kept on the occasion of his expeditions.

He also wrote another, describing a voyage, commenced at\r\nMemphis in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[823] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[824] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[825] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[826] The admiral of Alexander, who sailed down the river Indus, and\r\nup the Persian Gulf. It is not known when or where he died. After the\r\ndeath of Alexander, he supported the cause of Antigonus. He left a\r\nhistory or journal of his famous voyage.\r\n\r\n[827] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[828] Mentioned by Pliny in c. 21. He measured the distances of the\r\nmarches of Alexander the Great, and wrote a book on the subject.\r\n\r\n[829] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[830] A native of Soli. He is mentioned by Diogenes Laertius, as\r\nthe author of a work on Æthiopia, of which some few fragments\r\nare preserved. Varro and Pliny mention him, also, as a writer on\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n[831] A writer on geography and botany, again mentioned by Pliny in\r\nB. xx. c. 73. He is supposed to have lived in the first century after\r\nChrist. See also c. 35.\r\n\r\n[832] Said to have been a native of Meroë, and to have written a\r\nHistory of Æthiopia; nothing else seems to be known of him.\r\n\r\n[833] The author of a work on India, of which the second Book is quoted\r\nby Athenæus. From what Pliny says, in c. 35, he seems to have also\r\nwritten on Æthiopia. He is mentioned by Agatharchides as one of the\r\nwriters on the East: but nothing more seems to be known of him.\r\n\r\n[834] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[835] We here enter upon the third division of Pliny’s Natural History,\r\nwhich treats of Zoology, from the 7th to the 11th inclusive. Cuvier has\r\nillustrated this part by many valuable notes, which originally appeared\r\nin Lemaire’s _Bibliotheque Classique_, 1827, and were afterwards\r\nincorporated, with some additions, by Ajasson, in his translation of\r\nPliny, published in 1829; Ajasson is the editor of this portion of\r\nPliny’s Natural History, in Lemaire’s Edition.—B.\r\n\r\n[836] This remark refers to the five preceding books, in which these\r\nsubjects have been treated in detail.—B.\r\n\r\n[837] We have a similar remark in Cicero, De. Nat. Deor, ii. 47.—B.\r\n\r\n[838] Ajasson remarks, that trees have two barks, an outer, and an\r\ninner and thinner one; but seems to think that by the word “gemino”\r\nhere, Pliny only means that the bark of trees is sometimes double its\r\nordinary thickness.\r\n\r\n[839] It seems to have been the custom among the ancients to place the\r\nnewborn child upon the ground immediately after its birth.\r\n\r\n[840] Pliny appears to have followed Lucretius in this gloomy view of\r\nthe commencement of human existence. See B. v. l. 223, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[841] This term of forty days is mentioned by Aristotle, in his Natural\r\nHistory, as also by some modern physiologists.—B.\r\n\r\n[842] We may hence conclude, that the practice of swathing young\r\ninfants in tight bandages prevailed at Rome, in the time of Pliny, as\r\nit still does in France, and many parts of the continent; although\r\nit has, for some years, been generally discontinued in this country.\r\nBuffon warmly condemned this injurious system, eighty years ago, but\r\nwithout effect.—B.\r\n\r\n[843] “Feliciter natus;” this appears so inconsistent with what\r\nis stated in the text, that it has been proposed to alter it into\r\n_infeliciter_, although against the authority of all the MSS.; but it\r\nmay be supposed, that Pliny, as is not unusual with him, employs the\r\nterm ironically.—B.\r\n\r\n[844] This reminds us of the terms of the riddle proposed to Œdipus\r\nby the Sphinx: “What being is that, which, with four feet, has two\r\nfeet and three feet, and only one voice; but its feet vary, and where\r\nit has most it is weakest?” to which he answered, That it is man, who\r\nis a quadruped (going on feet and hands) in childhood, two-footed in\r\nmanhood, and moving with the aid of a staff in old age.\r\n\r\n[845] He alludes to the gradual induration of the bones of the head\r\nwhich takes place in the young of the human species, and imparts\r\nstrength to it. Aristotle, in his Hist. Anim., states the general\r\nopinion of the ancients, that this takes place with the young of no\r\nother class of animated beings.\r\n\r\n[846] There is little doubt that new forms and features of disease are\r\ncontinually making their appearance among mankind, and even the same\r\npeoples, and have been from the earliest period; it was so at Rome,\r\nin the days of the Republic and of the Emperors. It is not improbable\r\nthat these new forms of disease depend greatly upon changes in the\r\ntemperature and diet. The plagues of 1348, 1666, and the Asiatic\r\ncholera of the present day, are not improbably various features of what\r\nmay be radically the same disease. At the first period the beverage of\r\nthe English was beer, or rather sweet-wort, as the hop does not appear\r\nto have been used till a later period. At the present day, tea and\r\ncoffee, supported by ardent spirits, form the almost universal beverage.\r\n\r\n[847] Pliny forgets, however, that infants do _not_ require to be\r\ntaught how to suck.\r\n\r\n[848] According to Cicero, this opinion was more particularly expressed\r\nby Silenus and Euripides. Seneca also, in his Consolation to Marcia,\r\nexpresses a very similar opinion. It was a very common saying, that\r\n“Those whom the gods love, die young.” It will be observed that Pliny\r\nhere uses the significant word “aboleri,” implying utter annihilation\r\nafter death. It will be seen towards the end of this Book, that he\r\nlaughed to scorn the notion of the immortality of the soul.\r\n\r\n[849] By the use of the word “luctus” he may probably mean “tears;”\r\nbut there is little doubt that all animals have their full share of\r\nsorrows, brought upon them either by the tyranny and cruelty of man, or\r\ntheir own unrestrained passions.\r\n\r\n[850] This is said hyperbolically by Pliny. The brutes of the field\r\nhave as strong a love of life as man, although they may not be in fear\r\nof death, not knowing what it is. That they know what pain is, is\r\nevident from their instinctive attempts to avoid it.\r\n\r\n[851] Under this name he evidently intends to include all systems of\r\nreligion, which he held in equal contempt.\r\n\r\n[852] Ajasson seems to think that he alludes to man’s craving desire\r\nfor posthumous fame; but it is pretty clear that he has in view the\r\nthen prevalent notions of the life of the soul after the death of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n[853] Pascal has a similar thought; he says that “Man is a reed, and\r\nthe weakest reed of nature.” The machinery of his body is minute\r\nand complex in the extreme, but it can hardly be said that his life\r\nis exposed to as many dangers dependent on the volition of, or on\r\naccidents arising from, other animated beings, as that of minute\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n[854] Ajasson refers to various classical authors for a similar\r\nstatement. It is scarcely necessary to remark, that it is contrary to\r\nmany well-known facts.—B. The cravings of hunger and of the sexual\r\nappetite, are quite sufficient to preclude the possibility of such a\r\nhappy state of things among the brutes as Pliny here describes.\r\n\r\n[855] It was this feeling that prompted the common saying among the\r\nancients, “Homo homini lupus”—“Man to man is a wolf;” and most true it\r\nis, that\r\n\r\n  “Man’s inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn.”\r\n\r\n[856] He alludes to the description already given in his geographical\r\nBooks, of man taken in the aggregate, and grouped into nations.\r\n\r\n[857] These are less known, as being less easy of access to travellers,\r\nand it is accordingly in connection with these, that we always meet\r\nwith the most wonderful tales.—B.\r\n\r\n[858] This feeling is well expressed in the old and hackneyed adage,\r\n“Omne ignotum pro mirifico”—“Everything that is unknown is taken for\r\nmarvellous.”\r\n\r\n[859] Cuvier remarks, that Pliny generally employs this kind of\r\noratorical language when he is entering upon a part of his work in\r\nwhich he betrays a peculiar degree of credulity, and a total want of\r\ncorrect judgment on physical topics.—B.\r\n\r\n[860] Being debarred from holding converse, the first great tie of\r\nsociality.\r\n\r\n[861] Ajasson does not hesitate to style this remark, “ridiculum sane;”\r\nas every one knows that the Greeks were more noted for their lively\r\nimagination, than for the correctness of their observations.—B. Surely\r\nAjasson must have forgotten the existence of such men as Aristotle and\r\nTheophrastus!\r\n\r\n[862] Pliny has previously denominated the Scythians “Anthropophagi;”\r\nand in B. iv. c. 26, and B. vi. c. 20, he employs the word as the\r\nproper name of one of the Scythian tribes.—B.\r\n\r\n[863] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[864] See B. xxxvi. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[865] There can be no doubt, that cannibalism has existed at all\r\ntimes, and that it now exists in some of the Asiatic and Polynesian\r\nislands; but we must differ from Pliny in his opinion respecting the\r\nnear connection between human sacrifices and cannibalism; the first\r\nwas strictly a religious rite, the other was the result of very\r\ndifferent causes; perhaps, in some cases, the want of food; but, in\r\nmost instances, a much less pardonable motive.—B. Still, however, if\r\nnations go so far as to sacrifice human beings, there is an equal\r\nchance that a religious impulse may prompt them to taste the flesh; and\r\nwhen once this has been done, there is no telling how soon it may be\r\nrepeated, and that too for the gratification of the palate. According\r\nto Macrobius, human sacrifices were offered at Rome, down to the time\r\nof Brutus, who, on the establishment of the Republic, abolished them.\r\nWe read, however, in other authorities, that in 116, B.C., two Gauls,\r\na male and a female, were sacrificed by the priests in one of the\r\nstreets of Rome, shortly after which such practices were forbidden by\r\nthe senate, except in those cases in which they had been ordered by\r\nthe Sibylline books. Still we read, in the time of Augustus, of one\r\nhundred knights being sacrificed by his orders, at Perusia, and of\r\na similar immolation in the time of the emperor Aurelian, A.D. 270.\r\nThese, however, were all exceptional cases, and do not imply a custom\r\nof offering human sacrifices.\r\n\r\n[866] Pliny, in describing the Riphæan mountains, B. iv. c. 26, calls\r\nthem “gelida Aquilonis conceptacula,” “the cold asylum of the northern\r\nblasts;” but we do not find the cavern mentioned in this or any other\r\npassage. The name here employed has been supposed to be derived from\r\nthe Greek words, γης κλειθρον, signifying the limit or boundary of the\r\nearth.—B. “Specuque ejus dicto,” most probably means “the place called\r\nits cave,” and not the “cave which I have described,” as Dr. B. seems\r\nto have thought.\r\n\r\n[867] They are merely enumerated among other tribes of Scythians,\r\ninhabiting the country beyond the Palus Mæotis. See B. iv. c. 26, and\r\nB. vi. c. 19.—B.\r\n\r\n[868] The figures of the Gryphons or Griffins are found not uncommonly\r\non the friezes and walls at Pompeii. In the East, where there were no\r\nsafe places of deposit for money, it was the custom to bury it in the\r\nearth; hence, for the purpose of scaring depredators, the story was\r\ncarefully circulated that hidden treasures were guarded by serpents and\r\ndragons. There can be little doubt that these stories, on arriving in\r\nthe western world, combined with the knowledge of the existence of gold\r\nin the Uralian chain and other mountains of the East, gave rise to the\r\nstories of the Griffins and the Arimaspi. It has been suggested that\r\nthe Arimaspi were no other than the modern Tsheremis, who dwelt on the\r\nleft bank of the Middle Volga, in the governments of Kasan, Simbirsk,\r\nand Saratov, not far from the gold districts of the Uralian range.\r\n\r\n[869] It has been conjectured, that these fabulous tales of the combats\r\nof the Arimaspi with the Griffins, were invented by the neighbouring\r\ntribes of the Issedonæ or Essedones, who were anxious to throw a\r\nmystery over the origin of the gold, that they might preserve the\r\ntraffic in their own hands. The Altai Mountains, in the north of Asia,\r\ncontain many gold mines, which are still worked, as well as traces of\r\nformer workings. The representation of an animal, somewhat similar to\r\nthe Griffin, has been found among the sculptures of Persepolis, and\r\nis conceived to have had some allegorical allusion to the religion of\r\nthe ancient inhabitants of the place. Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 27,\r\ngives an account of the Griffin, and its contests with the Indians, for\r\nthe gold, similar to that here given.—B.\r\n\r\n[870] We have an account of the Arimaspi, and of Aristeas, in\r\nHerodotus, B. iv. cc. 13, 15, and 27. Most of the wonderful tales\r\nrelated in this Chapter may be found in Aulus Gellius, B. ix. c. 4. We\r\nhave an account, also, of the Arimaspi in Solinus, very nearly in the\r\nwords of Pliny. We have some valuable remarks by Cuvier, on the account\r\ngiven by Pliny of the Arimaspi and the Griffins, and on the source from\r\nwhich it appears to have originated, in Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 16, and\r\nAjasson, vol. vi. pp. 164, 165.—B.\r\n\r\n[871] The modern Himalaya range.\r\n\r\n[872] Aulus Gellius relates this, among other wonderful tales, which\r\nare contained in his Chapter “On the Miraculous Wonders of Barbarous\r\nNations,” B. ix. c. 4. He cites, among his authorities, Aristeas and\r\nIsigonus, whom he designates as “writers of no mean authority.”—B.\r\n\r\n[873] In B. iv. c. 26, and B. vi. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[874] One of the pleasures promised to the Gothic warriors, in the\r\nparadise of Odin, was to drink out of the skulls of their enemies.—B.\r\n\r\n[875] The variety of the human species to which the term Albino has\r\nbeen applied, from the whiteness of their hair and skin, is supposed by\r\nCuvier to be more frequently found in the close valleys of mountainous\r\ndistricts, and may therefore have been very often met with in Albania,\r\nwhich is composed of valleys in the Caucasian range.—B.\r\n\r\n[876] “Tertio die;” literally, “on the third day.” In reckoning the\r\ntime between two periods, the Romans included both of those periods in\r\nthe computation, whereas we include but one of them.\r\n\r\n[877] In countries where serpents abound, there have been, at all\r\ntimes, jugglers, who profess to have a supernatural power, by which\r\nthey are rendered insensible to the poison of these animals. This is\r\nthe case with the Egyptians, and some of the oriental nations. They\r\nremove the poison-fang from the serpent, and in this way render it\r\nperfectly harmless. Some of the feats which were performed by the\r\nmagicians in the court of Pharaoh, seem still to be practised in Egypt;\r\nby pressing upon the upper part of the spine, the animal is rendered\r\nrigid, while on removing the pressure, the animal is restored to its\r\noriginal state. These jugglers were also in the habit, much to the\r\nsurprise of the ignorant spectators, of sucking the poison from the\r\nwounds produced by the bite of the serpent, which they accompanied\r\nby various ceremonies and incantations: but it is a well-known fact,\r\nthat this may be done with perfect safety, in reference to poisons of\r\nall kinds, provided there be no breach in the cuticle of the mouth or\r\nlips.—B.\r\n\r\n[878] See B. xxviii. c. 7. The best account, probably, of the Psylli,\r\nis that found in Lucan’s Pharsalia, B. ix. c. 890, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[879] This custom is referred to by Lucan, in his account of the\r\nPsylli, B. ix. l. 890, _et seq._; and by Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. i. c.\r\n57, and B. xvi. c. 27, 28.—B.\r\n\r\n[880] Herodotus, B. iv. c. 173, gives a somewhat different account;\r\nsee also Aulus Gellius, B. xvi. c. 11, who follows the narrative of\r\nHerodotus. Gellius also gives an account of the Marsi, which is similar\r\nto that of Pliny.—B.\r\n\r\n[881] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that this alleged effect of\r\nthe human saliva is without foundation. The saliva of a person who has\r\nfasted for some time, is still, in this country, a popular remedy for\r\nophthalmia. It contains a greater proportion of saline matter than\r\nsaliva under ordinary circumstances.—B.\r\n\r\n[882] The Nasamones have been enumerated among the inhabitants of\r\nthe northern part of Africa, near the Greater Syrtis, v. 5. See also\r\nHerodotus, B. ii. c. 32, and B. vi. c. 172 and 190.—B.\r\n\r\n[883] Certain individuals are occasionally met with, whose generative\r\norgans exhibit an unusual formation, so as to give the idea of their\r\nuniting both sexes in the same person; and there are instances, where\r\nparts peculiar to both sexes actually appear to exist, but always in\r\nan imperfect or rudimentary state; all beyond this is undoubtedly\r\nfabulous. See _Todd’s Cyclop. of Anat._ _in loco_.—B.\r\n\r\n[884] There are, at the present day, individuals among the negroes,\r\nwho profess to have the power of enchantment, which, however, appears\r\nto consist in their possessing the knowledge of various poisons, which\r\nthey not unfrequently administer, and by these means obtain great\r\ninfluence over the minds of the people.—B.\r\n\r\n[885] This power of the eye is referred to by Virgil, Ecl. iii. l. 103:\r\n\r\n  “What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?”\r\n\r\nThe evil eye is still an article of belief in Egypt and in some parts\r\nof the East. Witchcraft, in various forms, was greatly credited in the\r\nmost enlightened parts of Europe, not more than two centuries ago, and\r\nis not yet excluded from the vulgar creed.—B.\r\n\r\n[886] It is well known that nothing of this kind was ever observed in\r\nany human eye, nor have we any method of accounting for the origin of\r\nthis singular notion.—B. Brand, in his Popular Antiquities, says that\r\nhe has no doubt whatever that the common expression “no one can say\r\n‘black is my eye’” [or rather “black is the white of my eye”]—meaning\r\nthat no one can justly speak ill of me, was derived from the notion\r\nof the _enchanting_, or _bewitching_, eye. He quotes from Reginald\r\nScott’s “Discovery of Witchcraft:” “Many writers agree with Virgil\r\nand Theocritus in the effect of bewitching eyes, affirming ‘that in\r\nScythia there are women called the Bythiæ, having two balls, or rather\r\n_blacks_, in the apples of their eyes.’ These, forsooth, with their\r\nangry looks, do bewitch and hurt, not only young lambs, but young\r\nchildren.” See Brand’s Popular Antiquities, vol. iii. pp. 44-46.\r\nSee also Ennemoser’s Hist. of Magic, vol. ii. pp. 160, 161. _Bohn’s\r\nEditions._\r\n\r\n[887] Some of the commentators have supposed, that Pliny, or\r\nPhylarchus, from whom he borrows, was misled by the ambiguity of the\r\nGreek term ἵππος, which signifies either a horse, or a tremulous motion\r\nof the eye. But, even admitting this to be the case, the wonder is\r\nscarcely diminished; for we have the double pupil in one eye, while\r\nthis supposed tremulous motion is confined to the other.—B.\r\n\r\n[888] In all ages, it has been a prevalent superstition, that those\r\nendowed with magical qualities will not sink in water, encouraged, no\r\ndoubt, by the cunning of those who might wish to make the charge a\r\nmeans of wreaking their vengeance. If they sank, they were to be deemed\r\ninnocent, but were drowned; if, on the other hand they floated, they\r\nwere deemed guilty, and handed over to the strong arm of the law. In\r\nreference to this usage, Brand says (“Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii.),\r\n“Swimming a witch was another kind of popular ordeal. By this method\r\nshe was handled not less indecently than cruelly: for she was stripped\r\nnaked and cross bound, the right thumb to the left toe, and the left\r\nthumb to the right toe. In this state she was cast into a pond or\r\nriver, in which, if guilty, it was thought impossible for her to sink.”\r\n\r\n[889] This is probably the meaning of the word “tabem” here; though it\r\nmay possibly signify “rottenness,” or “putrefaction.”\r\n\r\n[890] This remark is not contained in any of the works of Cicero now\r\nextant.—B.\r\n\r\n[891] Cuvier observes, that these people probably exercise some\r\ndeception, analogous to that practised by a Spaniard, who exhibited\r\nhimself in Paris, and professed to be incombustible, but who,\r\neventually, was the dupe of his own quackery, and paid the penalty with\r\nhis life. It would appear, that the Hirpi were not confined to one\r\ndistrict, but dispersed over different parts of Italy. See the note of\r\nHeyne, on the prayer of Aruns, Æn. B. xi. l. 785, _et seq._—B.\r\n\r\n[892] Plutarch relates these supposed facts in his life of Pyrrhus;\r\nthis statement may be considered analogous to what has been recorded\r\nin modern times, respecting the efficacy of the royal touch in curing\r\ncertain diseases, especially what has been termed the “King’s evil.”—B.\r\n\r\n[893] Horace, Odes, B. i. O. 22, characterises the Hydaspes, a river of\r\nIndia, by the title of “fabulosus.”—B.\r\n\r\n[894] See B. viii. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[895] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xvi. c. 11, and B. xvii. c. 26, refers to\r\nthe large size of many of the animals of India; and in B. iv. c. 19, he\r\nespecially describes the size and fierceness of the Indian dog.—B.\r\n\r\n[896] The _Ficus religiosa_ of Linnæus, the branches of which have the\r\nproperty of taking root when they are bent down to the ground, and of\r\nforming new stems, which again produce other branches, that may be\r\nbent down in the same way, so as to cover an indefinite space.—B. More\r\npopularly known as the “banyan tree.” See B. xii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[897] The _bambos arundinacea_, or bamboo cane, is a reed or plant\r\nof the gramineous kind, which frequently grows to the height of the\r\ntallest trees. The stem is hollow, and the parts of it between the\r\njoints are used by the natives to form their canoes. We have an account\r\nof them in Herodotus, B. iii. c. 98.—B. See also B. xvi. c. 65 of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[898] It does not appear that the stature of the Indians exceeds that\r\nof the inhabitants of the temperate zones.—B.\r\n\r\n[899] Some practices very similar to these exist in certain parts of\r\nIndia, by the Fakirs, a peculiar class of devotees, and are regarded\r\neither in the light of religious ceremonies, or of modes of performing\r\npenance.—B.\r\n\r\n[900] Henderson states, in his “Biblical Researches,” that there is a\r\nrace of people found in the Caucasus, and known as the Ingusch, and\r\nthat it is their belief that a race of dæmons exists, which assume the\r\nappearance of armed men, and have the feet inverted.\r\n\r\n[901] Cuvier remarks, that these wonderful tales are generally related\r\nof the inhabitants of mountainous districts, as being less known and\r\nless accessible to travellers.—B.\r\n\r\n[902] This account probably originated in a species of monkey, with a\r\nprojecting muzzle, called, from this circumstance, “cynocephalus,” or\r\nthe “Dog’s head.” This account of the cynocephali is repeated by Aulus\r\nGellius, B. ix. c. 4.—B. The cynocephalus is generally considered to be\r\nthe baboon.\r\n\r\n[903] So called, ἀπὸ τοῦ μονοῦ κώλου, “from having but one leg.” It\r\nis not improbable that these stories were first told of these nations\r\nfrom the resemblance of their names to the Greek words having these\r\nsignifications.\r\n\r\n[904] We have no method of explaining the origin of this story. It is\r\nto be regretted, that Pliny should have adopted so many ridiculous\r\nfables, on the doubtful authority of Ctesias.—B.\r\n\r\n[905] From Σκιαποῦς, “making a shadow with his foot.”—B.\r\n\r\n[906] Or “dwellers in caves.”\r\n\r\n[907] It has been conjectured, that this account may have originated in\r\nthe dwarfish stature and short necks of the northern tribes, according\r\nto the usual exaggerated statements of the ancient travellers. Aulus\r\nGellius also repeats this fable, B. ix. c. 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[908] These are the great apes, which are found in some of the Oriental\r\nislands; this name was given them from their salacious disposition,\r\nwhich, it would seem, they have manifested in reference to even the\r\nhuman species. We have an account of the Satyrs in Ælian, Hist. Anim.\r\nB. xvi. c. 21.—B.\r\n\r\n[909] We may suppose that this description is taken from some incorrect\r\naccount of a large kind of ape; but it seems impossible to refer it to\r\nany particular species.—B.\r\n\r\n[910] “Sparrow,” or “ostrich-footed;” it does not appear that the\r\ncommentators have attempted to explain this passage; may we not\r\nconjecture that it refers to the Chinese? With respect to the word\r\nemployed, it has been generally derived from στροῦθος, “a sparrow;”\r\nDalechamps, however, as it would appear, with much plausibility,\r\nthinks that it is derived from “struthio,” the ostrich.—B. It is not\r\nimprobable, however, that these were so called, from the resemblance of\r\ntheir gait to that of a sparrow, as they would be unable to step out,\r\nand be obliged to jump from place to place.\r\n\r\n[911] Or “wandering tribes.”\r\n\r\n[912] On this subject see B. vi. c. 20. It is clear that either silk or\r\ncotton is here alluded to.\r\n\r\n[913] In Eastern stories we find not uncommonly, wonderful effects\r\nattributed to the smell of the apple. See the Arabian Nights, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[914] Cuvier remarks, that these accounts of the Struthopodes, the\r\nScyritæ, and the Atomi, are not capable of any explanation, being mere\r\nfables.—B.\r\n\r\n[915] From τρεῖς, “three,” and σπιθαμαὶ, “spans,” the span being about\r\nnine inches English.\r\n\r\n[916] He alludes to the wars between the Cranes and the Pygmies in the\r\nIliad, B. iii. l. 3-6. Their story is also referred to by Ovid and\r\nJuvenal.\r\n\r\n[917] On the subject of the Pygmies, Cuvier remarks, “I am not\r\nsurprised at finding the Pygmies in the works of Homer; but to find\r\nthem in Pliny, I am surprised, indeed.”—B.\r\n\r\n[918] Or the “long livers,” from the Greek μακρὸς, “long,” and βίος,\r\n“life.”\r\n\r\n[919] Of course, there is no truth in this statement; there are,\r\nno doubt, various circumstances in these countries favourable to\r\nlongevity; but these are more than counter-balanced by certain\r\npeculiarities in their mode of life, and by the fatal epidemics to\r\nwhich they are occasionally subject.—B.\r\n\r\n[920] Pliny, in B. xxix. c. 38, speaks of the use of vipers’\r\nflesh as an article of diet, and gives some minute directions for\r\nits preparation. It was supposed to be peculiarly nutritive and\r\nrestorative, and it has been prescribed for the same purpose by modern\r\nphysicians. There is a medal in existence, probably struck by the\r\nEmperor Commodus, in order to commemorate the benefit which he was\r\nsupposed to have derived from the use of the flesh of vipers.—B.\r\n\r\n[921] See B. ii. c. 75.\r\n\r\n[922] The cubitus and the palmus of the Romans, estimated,\r\nrespectively, at about one foot and-a-half and three inches; this would\r\nmake the height of these people eight feet.—B.\r\n\r\n[923] From the Greek Γυμνητὴς, “one who takes much exercise of the\r\nbody.”\r\n\r\n[924] There appears to be no foundation for this statement.—B.\r\n\r\n[925] See B. vi. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[926] In many of the warmer climates, where the locusts are of large\r\nsize and in great abundance, they are occasionally used as food; but we\r\nhave no reason to believe that they constitute the sole, or even the\r\nprincipal article of the food of any tribe or people.—B.\r\n\r\n[927] In warm climates, the females arrive at maturity considerably\r\nearlier than in the more temperate regions, but the age here mentioned\r\nis an exaggeration. The female also, in such climates, ceases to bear\r\nat an earlier age, probably before the fortieth year.—B.\r\n\r\n[928] This is the Island of Ceylon, of which Pliny has given an account\r\nin the last Book, c. 24.\r\n\r\n[929] Such unnatural unions may have taken place occasionally, but\r\nnothing has ever been produced from them.—B.\r\n\r\n[930] This is a still greater exaggeration than that mentioned above,\r\nin Note 95.—B.\r\n\r\n[931] Cuvier remarks that this story must have been originally told\r\nwith reference to the race of large apes. He says, however, that some\r\nmen have the “os coccygis” greatly prolonged, and mentions a painter\r\nof celebrity in Paris who had this malformation. “But from this to an\r\nactual tail,” says he, “the distance is very great.” In these times\r\nwe have the (perhaps doubtful) account by M. de Couret, of the Niam\r\nNiams, a race in Abyssinia or Nubia, with tails at least two inches in\r\nlength. Few will fail to recollect Lord Monboddo’s theory, that mankind\r\noriginally had tails, but wore them off in lapse of time by climbing up\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n[932] As far as there is any truth in this account, it must refer to\r\ncertain kinds of apes: but with respect to the size of the ears, it is,\r\nof course, greatly exaggerated.—B.\r\n\r\n[933] Or Cophes, see B. vi. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[934] There are many tribes who live on the sea-coast, and who inhabit\r\na barren country, with a bad climate, whose diet is almost confined to\r\nfish, and who feed their cattle on it. This is the case in some parts\r\nof Iceland, and even, to a certain extent, among the people of the\r\nHebrides.—B.\r\n\r\n[935] Or dog’s-headed ape, the baboon: see B. vi. c. 35, and Note [902],\r\np. 130.\r\n\r\n[936] Perhaps these appearances may be referred to effects of what\r\nis termed “mirage,” a phenomenon which is described by travellers in\r\ndifferent parts of the torrid zone.—B. And in the temperate regions as\r\nwell; Switzerland and the Hartz mountains, for instance.\r\n\r\n[937] Columella, B. viii. c. 8, speaks of the fecundity of the\r\nEgyptians, but without ascribing any particular cause for it.—B.\r\n\r\n[938] “Quinos.” The old reading was “binos,” “two” children only; but\r\nAristotle, in reference, no doubt, to the same circumstance, says,\r\nHist. Anim. B. vii., “One woman, at four births, gave birth to twenty\r\nchildren. For she brought forth five at a time, and the greater part of\r\nthem were reared.”\r\n\r\n[939] It was a very general opinion, that the waters of the Nile\r\npossess the property of promoting fecundity. Seneca mentions it as an\r\nacknowledged fact, Nat. Quæst. B. iii. c. 25.—B.\r\n\r\n[940] There are well-authenticated accounts of four children having\r\nbeen produced at one birth; but, beyond this, we have no statements in\r\nwhich we can place much confidence. In a note by Dalechamps, we have\r\nan example of the credulity of the authors who have treated on this\r\ntopic, as well modern as ancient.—B. In the recent volumes, however, of\r\n“Notes and Queries,” we find some apparently well-authenticated cases\r\nof women being delivered of five children at a birth. Nathaniel Wanley,\r\nin his “Wonders of the Little World,” also gives some apparently\r\nauthentic instances of as many as five children being born at a birth:\r\nbut we must be excused giving credit to the story, quoted by him, of\r\nMatilda or Margaret, Countess of Henneberg, who was said to have been\r\ndelivered, on the Friday before Palm-Sunday, in 1276, “of 365 children,\r\nhalf sons and half daughters, with the exception of one, which was\r\nan hermaphrodite, all complete and well-fashioned, of the bigness of\r\nchickens new hatched, saith Camerarius.”\r\n\r\n[941] From Hermaphroditus, the son of Hermes or Mercury, and Aphrodite\r\nor Venus. According to the poetic story as told by Ovid, Met. B. iv.,\r\nhe was united in one body, which bore the characteristics of both\r\nsexes, with the nymph Salmacis.\r\n\r\n[942] Two cases of this description are mentioned by Livy, B. xxvii.\r\nc. 37, and B. xxxi. c. 12. In this latter passage, Livy enumerates\r\nthe following prodigious births; among the Sabines, two children of\r\ndoubtful sex; at Frusino, a lamb with a sow’s head; at Sinuessa, a pig\r\nwith a human head; and among the Lucani, a foal with five feet. He\r\ninforms us that the hermaphrodites were thrown into the sea.—B.\r\n\r\n[943] Cuvier says, “From time to time we do see persons of this nature;\r\nand it is not long ago that such a being was exhibited in Paris, though\r\ncertainly not of a nature to have been ‘in deliciis,’ at the present\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n[944] Pliny gives further particulars of this theatre in B. xxxvi. c.\r\n24. It was the first stone theatre erected at Rome, and was built B.C.\r\n55, and contained 40,000 spectators.\r\n\r\n[945] Solinus, the ape of Pliny, absolutely takes the meaning of this\r\npassage to be, that Eutychis herself was exhibited on the stage by the\r\norders of Pompey.\r\n\r\n[946] For Tralles, in Asia Minor, see B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[947] Cuvier speaks of the wife of a porter at the Jardin du Roi, at\r\nParis, who, to his knowledge, had been the mother of thirty children.\r\n\r\n[948] It seems doubtful whether Pliny means that the statue of Alcippe\r\nwas also to be seen in the Theatre of Pompey. Tatianus tells the same\r\nstory of one Glaucippe, and it is not improbable that under that name\r\nhe refers to the same person. He says that a bronze statue of her was\r\nmade by Niceretus, the Athenian. Hardouin suggests that this is the\r\nstory alluded to by Livy, B. xxvii., and by Valerius Maximus, B. i. c.\r\n6, in their statement that, among other portents, a boy was born with\r\nthe head of an elephant.\r\n\r\n[949] Cuvier remarks, that it is not an uncommon circumstance, both\r\nin man and in other animals, for an atrophy of the maxillary bones to\r\ncause the nose to sink down, and produce some resemblance to the trunk\r\nof an elephant. To this circumstance, he refers the tales met with, of\r\nwomen, sows, and dogs having produced elephants; see also Val. Maximus,\r\nB. vi. c. 5.—B.\r\n\r\n[950] As to this war, see B. ii. c. 85. The portents observed on this\r\noccasion were collected by the historian Sisenna, as we learn from\r\nCicero, De Divin. B. ii.\r\n\r\n[951] We find that this incredible tale is not only told by Julius\r\nObsequens, but, according to Dalechamps, by Cornelius Gemma, a\r\ncomparatively modern writer.—B.\r\n\r\n[952] Cuvier remarks, that, in certain quadrupeds, individuals are\r\noccasionally born with the upper jaw preternaturally small, so much\r\nso, that the lower jaw, by its projection, bears some resemblance to\r\na human chin. He had seen a case of this description at Geneva, in a\r\ncalf, supposed, even by persons of information, to be the produce of an\r\nunnatural connection of a cow with a Savoyard shepherd. This subject is\r\ntreated very philosophically by Lucretius, B. v. c. 876, _et seq._ With\r\nrespect to the supposed Hippocentaur of Thessaly, Cuvier remarks upon\r\nthe successive additions which the story had gained, in the writings of\r\nvarious authors. Cicero, in various parts of his writings, refers to\r\nthe account of the Hippocentaur as a fabulous tale; Tusc. Quæst. B. i.\r\nc. 27; de Nat. Deor. B. i. c. 38, and B. ii. c. 2; De Divin. B. ii. c.\r\n21.—B.\r\n\r\n[953] Consuls A.U.C. 581.\r\n\r\n[954] See B. iii. c. 9. Hardouin remarks that Aulus Gellius, in copying\r\nfrom this passage, seems to have read the word “Casini,” as though\r\nit were C. Asinii, meaning that the boy belonged to one C. Asinius.\r\nHowever, it is pretty clear that the reading adopted is the right one,\r\nPliny having been careful to give the various localities at which these\r\nwonderful facts occurred.\r\n\r\n[955] Phlegon tells us that this happened in the first year of Nero,\r\nand that the name of the youth, while supposed to be a girl, was\r\nPhilotis.\r\n\r\n[956] See B. v. c. 4, 5.\r\n\r\n[957] A case of this description is mentioned by Ambrose Paré. The\r\nindividual was brought up as a girl, but, in consequence of a sudden\r\nmuscular exertion, the organs of the male were developed, which had\r\npreviously been concealed internally. It may be remarked, that a great\r\nproportion of the well-authenticated cases of a supposed change of sex\r\nhave been from the female to the male, evidently of the kind mentioned\r\nby Paré, where the male organs have been concealed in childhood, and\r\nbecome subsequently developed. Cases, however, have occasionally\r\noccurred of the contrary kind, arising probably from the unusual\r\nsize of the clitoris; there are also certain cases, where, from the\r\nmalformation of the parts, the sex is actually doubtful, or where\r\neven a certain degree of the two may exist, as has been stated above,\r\nin Note 51 to Chapter 2. This paragraph of Pliny is quoted by Aulus\r\nGellius, B. ix. c. 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[958] This does not correspond with the fact, as it exists in our time;\r\na circumstance which may probably depend upon our improvement in the\r\nobstetrical art. Nor is the opinion, that both twins are less likely to\r\nlive, if of different sexes, sanctioned by modern experience.—B.\r\n\r\n[959] “Feminas gigni celerius quam mares;” there has been much\r\ndiscussion among the commentators, both with respect to the meaning of\r\nthese words, and the fact to which they are supposed to refer. Hardouin\r\ninterprets the phrase, “crescere, perfici, vigere, adolescere;”\r\nCuvier translates it, “les filles sont portées moins long-temps par\r\nleur mère.” There is, however, no foundation for this opinion as to a\r\ndifference in the period of the gestation.—B.\r\n\r\n[960] There may be some ground for this opinion; it is maintained by\r\nAristotle in his Hist. Anim.—B. As also by Galen.\r\n\r\n[961] This statement is made upon the authority of Hippocrates, Aphor.\r\nB. v. c. 48, and Aristotle, Hist. Anim.; but is probably without\r\nfoundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[962] Animals have a certain period for generation, because they are\r\nmore immediately affected by the seasons, whereas, in the human race,\r\nthe arts of life render these fixed terms unnecessary.—B.\r\n\r\n[963] Notwithstanding all the observations of the moderns, the\r\nquestion is scarcely decided respecting the length of time to which\r\npregnancy may be prolonged. Cuvier says, that the experiments of\r\nTessier have shewn, that there is a greater latitude in animals than\r\nhad previously been supposed; he also remarks, that the same animals\r\nwhen domesticated, become less regular in this respect than in the wild\r\nstate.—B.\r\n\r\n[964] Dalechamps has collected authorities to prove, that a child may\r\nsurvive, when born even at an earlier period; but this, although not\r\nabsolutely impossible, is improbable in the highest degree.—B.\r\n\r\n[965] Ajasson expresses himself at a loss to identify this Pomponius;\r\nbut thinks that it may have been either Julius Pomponius Græcinus,\r\nconsul A.U.C. 759, or L. Pomponius, consul A.U.C. 794, A.D. 41.\r\n\r\n[966] Caius Caligula. The name of this woman, who was first his\r\nmistress and then his wife, was Milonia Cæsonia. She was neither\r\nhandsome nor young when Caligula first admired her: but was noted for\r\nher extreme licentiousness, and at the time when she first became\r\nintimate with Caligula, had already had three children. She and\r\nher daughter, by him, were put to death on the day on which he was\r\nmurdered. Corbulo has been mentioned in B. vi. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[967] Celsus, B. ii. c. 1, speaks of the fortieth day, as one of the\r\ncritical periods of childhood; the others are the seventh month, the\r\nseventh year, and the period of puberty.—B.\r\n\r\n[968] Who appears to have urged the great lapse of time that had\r\nintervened between the death of the alleged father and the birth of his\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\n[969] Questions of this nature, of great importance, involving property\r\nand title, have been the subject of judicial consideration in our\r\ntimes; the longest period to which pregnancy may be protracted seems\r\nstill not to be determined, but the general result has been to shorten\r\nit. Aulus Gellius, B. iii. c. 16, has collected the opinions of many of\r\nthe ancients on this subject.—B.\r\n\r\n[970] Most of the statements made in this Chapter appear to be taken\r\nfrom Aristotle’s History of Animals; they are, however, either without\r\nfoundation or much exaggerated, and very incorrect.—B.\r\n\r\n[971] This opinion, although without foundation, is supported by the\r\nauthority of Hippocrates, Aphor. B. v. c. 42.—B.\r\n\r\n[972] This singular opinion is referred to by Aulus Gellius, B. iii. c.\r\n16.—B.\r\n\r\n[973] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 54, mentions the smell of an\r\nextinguished lamp, as producing abortion in a mare.—B.\r\n\r\n[974] “Tinctoria mens;” there has been much discussion, whether\r\nthe text does not require correction here; and various conjectural\r\nemendations have been proposed, but not with much success. If the word\r\n“tinctoria” was employed by Pliny, it may be regarded as one of those\r\nbold, and somewhat metaphorical expressions, which are not unfrequently\r\nfound in his writings.—B.\r\n\r\n[975] Valerius Maximus makes the same statement as to the death of\r\nAnacreon, and says that “having lived to an extreme old age, he was\r\nsupporting his decayed strength by chewing raisins, when one grain,\r\nmore obstinate than the rest, stuck in his parched throat, and so\r\nended his life.” This story has been looked upon by some of the modern\r\nscholars as a fiction of the poets.\r\n\r\n[976] This explanation of the name is given by Aulus Gellius, B.\r\nxvi. c. 6.—B. It is very doubtful what are the roots from which it\r\nis formed; though Pliny evidently thinks that the word is only a\r\ncorruption of the Latin “ægre partus,” “born with difficulty;” a notion\r\nsavouring of absurdity.\r\n\r\n[977] M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus, having married\r\nhis dissolute daughter, Julia. He was the son of Lucius Agrippa,\r\nand was descended from a very obscure family. He divorced his wife\r\nMarcella, to marry Julia, the widow of Marcellus, and the daughter of\r\nAugustus, by his third wife, Scribonia.\r\n\r\n[978] Agrippina, the daughter of Agrippa and Julia, was the mother of\r\nthe Emperor Caligula; and of a second Agrippina, who became the mother\r\nof Nero, by whose order she was put to death.—B.\r\n\r\n[979] Julia, the daughter of Augustus, so notorious for her depravity,\r\nwho, as already stated, was the wife of Agrippa.—B. See c. 46 of the\r\npresent Book.\r\n\r\n[980] From cædo, “to cut,” apparently. The Cæsones were a branch of\r\nthe Fabian family. There has been considerable difference of opinion\r\namong the commentators respecting the individuals referred to in this\r\nChapter. The subject is discussed at length in the Notes of Hardouin,\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 62.—B. So in Macbeth, act v. sc. 7, Macduff says\r\nto Macbeth—\r\n\r\n  “And let the angel whom thou still hast serv’d,\r\n  Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb\r\n  Untimely ripp’d.”\r\n\r\n[981] The commentators are not agreed respecting the origin of this\r\nname; Dalechamps suggests, that it was originally Opiscus, from\r\nὀπίσθιον, “because one follows close upon another.”—B.\r\n\r\n[982] Hardouin says, that this is the case with the hare and the\r\ndasypus, which is a species of hare; but there is probably no\r\nfoundation for the statement. Pliny repeats it in a subsequent passage,\r\nB. viii. c. 81.—B.\r\n\r\n[983] Pliny evidently considers this a case of superfœtation, and\r\nlooks upon it as not uncommon in the human species: whereas it is now\r\nconsidered impossible.\r\n\r\n[984] This refers to the mythological tale of Jupiter and Amphitryon.—B.\r\n\r\n[985] See B. v. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[986] Most of these statements appear to be taken from Aristotle, Hist.\r\nAnim.—B.\r\n\r\n[987] There has been much discussion respecting the meaning of this\r\npassage and the fact to which it refers. Aristotle, Hist. Anim., says,\r\nthat marks made on the arm are transmitted for three generations; and\r\nPliny, in B. xxii. c. 2, informs us, that the Daci and the Sarmatæ\r\n“make written marks upon their bodies.” The same custom prevails among\r\nthe lower orders, sailors especially, in our own times. We may also\r\nremark the analogy which it hears to the practice of tattooing, so\r\ngeneral among the Polynesian and other barbarous nations.—B.\r\n\r\n[988] The reader may be amused by a perusal of the collection of\r\nwonderful cases of this kind, which has been made by Dalechamps; see\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 65, note 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[989] Aristotle, in his History of Animals, relates a similar, but\r\nnot the same, story; he says that it occurred in Sicily, though he\r\nafterwards speaks of it as having happened in Elis. It is conjectured\r\nby Ajasson, that the individual might have been born in Sicily, and\r\nhave exhibited himself in Elis, as a wrestler. If we are really to\r\nbelieve that his complexion was that of an Æthiopian, it is much more\r\nprobable that his mother may have had connection with a negro.—B.\r\n\r\n[990] Few readers will fail here to recall to mind the story about the\r\nclock, in the opening chapter of “Tristram Shandy.”\r\n\r\n[991] Dalechamps refers us to a remark of the same kind in Cicero,\r\nTusc. Quæst. B. i. c. 80; but Ajasson remarks, that the resemblance\r\nmentioned by Cicero refers to the mind and manners, not to the body;\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 67.—B.\r\n\r\n[992] Aulus Gellius says, that he was one of the royal family.\r\n\r\n[993] This man resembled Antiochus III., surnamed the Great, to\r\nsuch a degree, that when that monarch had been slain in a tumult by\r\nhis people, his wife, Laodice, daughter of Mithridates V., King of\r\nPontus, put Artemon into a bed, pretending that he was the king,\r\nbut dangerously ill. Many persons were admitted to see him; and all\r\nbelieved that they were listening to the words of their king, when he\r\nrecommended to them Laodice and her children.\r\n\r\n[994] This circumstance is related by Valerius Maximus, but he speaks\r\nof Vibius as being “ingenuæ stirpis,” “of good family.”—B.\r\n\r\n[995] Hardouin expands the words “os probum,” into “liberale, venustum,\r\ngratum, venerandum, probandum,” B. xxxvii. c. 6.—B.\r\n\r\n[996] See B. xxxvii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[997] The Latin word “strabo,” means “squinting,” or “having a cast” or\r\n“defect in the eye.”\r\n\r\n[998] The word “mimus” was applied by the Romans to a species of\r\ndramatic performance, as well as to the persons who acted in them.\r\nThe Roman mimes were imitations of trivial and sometimes indecent\r\noccurrences in life, and scarcely differed from comedy, except in\r\nconsisting more of gestures and mimicry than of spoken dialogue. Sylla\r\nwas very fond of these performances, and they had more charms for the\r\nRoman populace than the regular drama. As to the mime Salvitto, here\r\nmentioned, see B. xxxv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[999] This anecdote, and the one respecting Spinther and Pamphilus, are\r\nmentioned also by Val. Maximus, B. ix. c. 24.—B.\r\n\r\n[1000] A celebrated orator and satirical writer of the time of Augustus\r\nand Tiberius. He is mentioned in the Index of authors at the end of B.\r\nxxxvi., where he is called Longulanus, as being a native of Longula,\r\na town of Latium. It was even thrown in his teeth, that he was the\r\noffspring of adultery, and that this low-born person was his father.\r\n\r\n[1001] “Mirmillonis.” Many of the editions make this word to be a\r\nproper name, and “Armentarius” to signify the calling of the person\r\ndescribed, as being a herdsman. The “Mirmillones” were a peculiar class\r\nof gladiators, said to have been so called from their having the image\r\nof a fish, called “mormyr,” on their helmets.\r\n\r\n[1002] We assume the sestertium to be equivalent to somewhat more than\r\neight pounds sterling; this sum will be about £1600.—B.\r\n\r\n[1003] “Proscripter animus.” According to Hardouin, this means\r\n“delighting in proscription,” alluding to the well-known proscriptions\r\nof the triumvirate, in which Antony acted so conspicuous a part.—B.\r\n\r\n[1004] This opinion is maintained by Hippocrates, and by Aristotle,\r\nHist. Anim. B. vii. c. 8, and is referred to by Lucretius, B. iv. c.\r\n1242, _et seq._—B.\r\n\r\n[1005] The case of Livia and that of Agrippina, referred to by Pliny,\r\nare mentioned by Suetonius, in the Life of Augustus, c. 63; and that of\r\nCaligula, c. 7.—B.\r\n\r\n[1006] M. Junius Silanus, consul under Claudius, A.D. 46, with Valerius\r\nAsiaticus. He was poisoned by order of the younger Agrippina, that he\r\nmight not stand in the way of Nero.\r\n\r\n[1007] He is first mentioned in B.C. 168, when he was serving in the\r\narmy of Æmilius Paulus, in Macedonia, and was sent to Rome with two\r\nother envoys to announce the defeat of Perseus. He united with the\r\naristocracy in opposing the measures of the Gracchi; and the speech\r\nwhich he delivered against Tiberius Gracchus, is spoken of by Cicero in\r\nhigh terms, as replete with true eloquence.\r\n\r\n[1008] He left four sons and two daughters; some writers say three.\r\nThe ten individuals, over and above his children and grandchildren,\r\nmay have consisted of the wives and husbands of his sons and daughters\r\n_then_ living, as also of others who had died in his lifetime.\r\n\r\n[1009] 11th of April.\r\n\r\n[1010] See B. iii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[1011] This fact is mentioned by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 13.\r\nThere is some variation in the spelling of the name of the son of\r\nMasinissa; Solinus calls him Mathumannus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1012] Hardouin gives a detailed account of the children of Cato, by\r\nwhich it appears that the Licinian branch descended from the issue by\r\nhis wife Licinia, and the Saloniani, of whom Cato of Utica was one,\r\nfrom his son Salonianus, by his second wife, Salonia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1013] Volusius Saturninus is again mentioned in the 49th Chapter, as a\r\nremarkable instance of longevity; also by Tacitus, B. xiii. c. 30.—B.\r\n\r\n[1014] This reading seems preferable to sixty-second, adopted by\r\nSillig; as there would be nothing very remarkable in a man becoming a\r\nfather when sixty-two years of age.\r\n\r\n[1015] Some of the “simiæ” are subject to a periodical discharge,\r\nanalogous to that of the human female; but, according to Cuvier, it is\r\nin smaller quantity, and not at stated periods. The females of various\r\nother animals, when in a state to receive the male, have a discharge\r\nfrom the same parts, but totally different in its properties, and the\r\nmode in which it makes its appearance. Virgil, Geor. B. iii. l. 280,\r\n_et seq._, refers to this subject.—B.\r\n\r\n[1016] Pliny makes some further remarks on these substances in a\r\nsubsequent place, see B. x. c. 84; where he says they are produced\r\nwithout the intercourse of the male; this point has been much\r\ndiscussed, and is perhaps scarcely yet decided.—B.\r\n\r\n[1017] There is no actual resemblance between moles and schirri; they\r\nare produced by different causes, and exist in different parts of the\r\nbody. Moles are always formed in the womb, and probably have some\r\nconnection with the generative functions; while schirri are morbid\r\nindurations, which make their appearance in various parts of the body.\r\nHippocrates gives some account of moles, in his work on the Diseases of\r\nWomen. They are also noticed by Aristotle.—B.\r\n\r\n[1018] All the poisonous and noxious effects which were attributed by\r\nthe ancients to the menstrual discharge, are without the slightest\r\nfoundation. The opinions entertained on this point by the Jews, may be\r\ncollected from Leviticus, c. xv. ver. 19, _et seq._ Pliny enlarges upon\r\nthis subject in a subsequent place. See B. xxviii. c. 23.—B.\r\n\r\n[1019] Both Josephus, Bell. Jud. B. iv. c. 9, and Tacitus, Hist. B.\r\nv. c. 6, give an account of this supposed action of this fluid on\r\nthe bitumen of Lake Asphaltites; the statement is no doubt entirely\r\nunfounded, but it is a curious instance of popular credulity.—B.\r\n\r\n[1020] There are still somewhat similar superstitions in existence,\r\neven in this country among others; it is not uncommonly believed that\r\nmeat will not take salt from the hands of a female during the discharge\r\nof the catamenia.\r\n\r\n[1021] This statement is without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1022] The fact is true, that females in whom the menstrual discharge\r\ndoes not take place, are seldom, if ever, capable of conception; but it\r\ndoes not depend on the cause here assigned. See the remarks of Cuvier,\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 82, and Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 173.—B.\r\n\r\n[1023] Pliny clearly alludes to an opinion expressed by Galen, in which\r\nhe says, “that if women while giving suck, have sexual intercourse, the\r\nmilk becomes tainted.” Hardouin remarks, that Pliny shows considerable\r\ncaution here in bringing forward Nigidius as the propounder of these\r\nopinions, the truth of which he himself seems to have doubted.\r\n\r\n[1024] It is generally admitted, that the female is more disposed to\r\nconceive just after the cessation of each periodical discharge. We are\r\ninformed by the French historians, that their king, Henry II., and his\r\nwife Catharine, having been childless eleven years, made a successful\r\nexperiment of this description, by the advice of the physician Fernel;\r\nsee Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 83.—B.\r\n\r\n[1025] This is one of the many idle tales referred to by Pliny,\r\nentirely without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1026] This account is correct, to the extent that the first teeth that\r\nappear are the two central incisors of the upper jaw; the next are the\r\ntwo lower central incisors, then the upper lateral incisors, the lower\r\nlateral incisors, and the upper and lower canines. The molars follow a\r\ndifferent order, the lower ones appearing before the upper.—B.\r\n\r\n[1027] Hardouin mentions a number of authors who relate cases of this\r\nnature. It is said to have taken place with our king Richard III.\r\nSee Shakespeare, Richard III., Act i. Scene 4. An individual of very\r\ndifferent character and fortune, Louis XIV., is said to have been born\r\nwith two teeth in the upper jaw.—B.\r\n\r\n[1028] A town of Latium; we learn from Livy, B. i. c. 53, that it was\r\ncaptured and plundered by Tarquinius Superbus, but he makes no mention\r\nof Valeria. See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1029] It is stated by Seneca, De Consol. c. 16, that Cornelia survived\r\na large family of children, all of whom were carried off early in life;\r\nof these the two celebrated Gracchi, Tiberius and Caius, met with\r\nviolent deaths. The peculiarity here referred to, probably consisted\r\nin an imperforated hymen, a mal-formation which not very unfrequently\r\nexists, and requires a surgical operation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1030] This circumstance is mentioned by Val. Maximus, B. i. c. 8.—B.\r\nWe learn from Plutarch, that the same was the case also with Pyrrhus,\r\nking of Epirus: Euryphæus also, the Cyrenian, and Euryptolemus, the\r\nking of Cyprus. Herodotus, B. ix., speaks of a skull found on the plain\r\nof Platæa, with a similar conformation.\r\n\r\n[1031] Although the teeth, and especially their enamel, form the most\r\nindestructible substance which enters into the composition of the body,\r\nit is not absolutely so; a certain proportion of them consisting of\r\nanimal matter, which is consumed, when exposed to a sufficient heat;\r\nthe earthy part may also be dissolved by the appropriate chemical\r\nre-agents.—B.\r\n\r\n[1032] Powerful acids for instance; but they destroy the enamel. Lord\r\nBacon recommends the ashes of tobacco as a whitener of the teeth; but\r\nthat has been found to have a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[1033] We find in Haller, El. Phys. B. ix. c. 2, 4, 8, and in other\r\nphysiologists, a minute account of the effects produced by the teeth in\r\nthe articulation of the various letters which compose the alphabet.—B.\r\n\r\n[1034] See B. iii. c. 3, and B. iv. c. 35. He does not say how many\r\nteeth the Turduli naturally had, but no doubt he is mistaken.\r\n\r\n[1035] Pliny repeats this statement in B. xi. c. 63, and extends it\r\nto the females of the sheep, goat, and hog. In the natural condition\r\nof the mouth, the number of the teeth is the same in both sexes; but,\r\naccording to the observations of Cuvier, what are called the “wisdom”\r\nteeth, though occasionally deficient in both sexes, are most frequently\r\nso in the female.—B.\r\n\r\n[1036] He seems to allude to the younger Agrippina, the mother of\r\nthe emperor Domitius Nero; neither her life, her character, nor her\r\nultimate fate seem, however, to have entitled her to be called a\r\nfavourite of Fortune. Her mother, the first Agrippina, grand-daughter\r\nof Augustus, appears, on the other hand, to have been a woman of\r\nvirtuous character, and spotless chastity, without a vice, with the\r\nexception, perhaps, of ambition.\r\n\r\n[1037] See B. x. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1038] It was one of the tenets of the Stoics, that the world was to be\r\nalternately destroyed by water and by fire. The former element having\r\nlaid it waste on the occasion of the flood of Deucalion, the next great\r\ncatastrophe, according to them, is to be produced by fire. Pliny has\r\npreviously alluded to this opinion, B. ii. c. 110.—B.\r\n\r\n[1039] Cuvier remarks, that in the alluvial tracts throughout Europe,\r\nSiberia, and America, and probably also in other parts of the world,\r\nbones have been found, which have belonged to very large animals, such\r\nas elephants, mastodons, and whales; and when discovered, the common\r\npeople, and sometimes even anatomists, have mistaken them for the bones\r\nof giants. He especially mentions the case of the bones of an elephant,\r\nfound near Lucerne, in the sixteenth century, and supposed by Plater\r\nto have belonged to a man seventeen feet in height. Cuvier conceives\r\nthat no man in modern times has exceeded the height of seven feet,\r\nand even these cases are extremely rare; for further information he\r\nrefers to his _Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles_. Some of the best\r\nauthenticated facts of unusually tall men are in Buffon, Nat. Hist.\r\nvol. ii. p. 276, and vol. iii. p. 427.—B. The skeleton of O’Brien, in\r\nthe Museum of the College of Surgeons, in London, is about seven feet\r\nand a half in height.\r\n\r\n[1040] The story of the birth of Orion is beautifully told by Ovid,\r\nFasti, B. v. l. 493. _et seq._ He was often represented by the poets as\r\nof gigantic stature, and after his death was fabled to have been placed\r\namong the stars, where he appears as a giant. It is not improbable\r\nthat, like the Cyclopes, Hercules, and Atlas, he may have been one of\r\nthe earliest benefactors of mankind, and an assiduous improver of their\r\ncondition; whence the story of his gigantic size.\r\n\r\n[1041] A gigantic son of Poseidon or Neptune, and Iphimedeia, one of\r\nthe Alöeidæ.\r\n\r\n[1042] We have an account of this supposed discovery of the body of\r\nOrestes in Herodotus, B. i. c. 68, and a reference to it, with some\r\npertinent remarks, in Aulus Gellius, B. iii. c. 10.—B.\r\n\r\n[1043] Il. B. v. l. 303, 4, B. xii. l. 449: this opinion of Homer was\r\nadopted by many of the Latin poets; for example, by Virgil, B. xii. l.\r\n900; by Juvenal, Sat. xv. l. 69, 70; and by Horace, Od. B. iii. O. 6,\r\n_sub finem_.\r\n\r\n[1044] Columella speaks of Cicero as mentioning this Pollio, and\r\nstating that he was a foot taller than any one else. It is most\r\nprobably in Cicero’s lost book, “De Admirandis,” that this mention was\r\nmade of him.\r\n\r\n[1045] Hardouin supposes that this was not an individual name, but a\r\nterm derived from the Hebrew, descriptive of his remarkable size.—B. He\r\nsupposes also that not improbably this was the same individual that is\r\nmentioned by Tacitus, Annals, B. xii. c. 12, as Acharus, a king of the\r\nArabians.\r\n\r\n[1046] According to our estimate of the Roman measures, this would\r\ncorrespond to about nine feet four and a half inches of our standard.—B.\r\n\r\n[1047] “Conditorio Sallustianorum.” The more general meaning attributed\r\nto the word “conditorium,” is “tomb” or burial-place. We learn from\r\nother sources that the famous “gardens of Sallust” belonged to the\r\nemperor Augustus, and it is not improbable that there was a museum\r\nthere of curiosities, in which these remarkable skeletons were kept.\r\n\r\n[1048] “Loculis.” It is not quite clear whether this word has the\r\nmeaning here of chest or coffin, or of a niche or cavity made in the\r\nwall of the tomb.\r\n\r\n[1049] Among the objects of curiosity which were exhibited by Augustus\r\nto the Roman people, as related by Suetonius, c. 43, was a dwarf named\r\nLucius, who is there described; but he would appear to be a different\r\nperson from any of those here mentioned.—B.\r\n\r\n[1050] Seneca also mentions him in his Consolation to Marcia, c. 23.\r\n\r\n[1051] The procurator of a province was an officer appointed by the\r\nCæsar to perform the duties discharged by the quæstor in the other\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n[1052] We have an ingenious dissertation by Ajasson, the object of\r\nwhich is to show, that the Tacitus here referred to, is not the\r\nhistorian, but his father, and consequently, that the boy prematurely\r\nborn must have been the historian’s brother, not his son.—B.\r\n\r\n[1053] It is not clear whether Pliny intended to apply all these three\r\nobservations to the female, or only the last of them; it appears,\r\nhowever, that the remark is, in either case, without foundation.—B. He\r\nappears to intend that his observations should apply more especially to\r\nthe strength of the arm.\r\n\r\n[1054] This is incorrect; the human body, after death, does not float\r\nuntil decomposition has commenced, when it becomes more or less\r\nbuoyant, in consequence of the formation of gases, which partially\r\ndistend the cavities; but we do not observe any difference in the two\r\nsexes in this respect.—B.\r\n\r\n[1055] This statement is altogether incorrect.—B.\r\n\r\n[1056] The total abstinence from liquids in dropsy, was a point much\r\ninsisted upon by medical practitioners, even in modern times; but it is\r\nnow generally conceived to have been derived from a false theory, and\r\nnot to be essential to the cure of the disease, while it imposes upon\r\nthe patient a most severe privation. A moderate use of fluids is even\r\nfavourable to the operation of the remedies that are employed in this\r\ndisease.—B.\r\n\r\n[1057] From the Greek ἀγελαστὸς, “one who does not laugh.” Cicero\r\nrefers to this peculiarity in the character of Crassus, in his treatise\r\nDe Finibus, B. v. c. 92; and in the Tusc. Quest. B. iii. c. 3, he\r\ninforms us, on the authority of Lucilius, that Crassus never laughed\r\nbut once in his life.—B. And then, on seeing a donkey eating thistles;\r\nupon which he exclaimed, “Similem habent labia lactucam,” “Like lips,\r\nlike lettuce.”\r\n\r\n[1058] “Without passion;” equivalent to our English word\r\n“apathetical.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1059] The daughter of M. Antony by Octavia. She was the mother of\r\nGermanicus Cæsar, and the grandmother of the emperor Caligula, whom she\r\nlived to see on the throne, and who is supposed to have hastened her\r\ndeath. She was celebrated for her beauty and chastity—a rare virtue in\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\n[1060] Pliny, B. xxxi. c. 45, says, that this state of the bones is\r\nfound in fishermen, from their being exposed to the action of the sea\r\nand salt water; but both the fact and the supposed cause are without\r\nfoundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1061] “Cornei.”\r\n\r\n[1062] It would appear that the Samnites were not only one of the\r\nmost warlike people, with whom the Romans had to contest in the\r\ninfancy of their state, but that they were particularly celebrated as\r\ngladiators.—B.\r\n\r\n[1063] The gladiators, called Samnites, were armed with the peculiar\r\n“scutum,” or oblong shield, used by the Samnites, a greave on the left\r\nleg, a sponger on the breast, and a helmet with a crest.\r\n\r\n[1064] The term “nervus” was generally applied by the ancients to the\r\nsinews or tendons; they had a very indistinct knowledge of what are\r\nproperly called the “nerves.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1065] Pintianus suggests another reading here, which would appear to\r\nbe much more consistent with probability. “Inermi dextrâ superatum, et\r\nuno digito postremo correptum in castra,” &c.—“Conquered him with the\r\nright hand, and that unarmed, and then with a single finger dragged him\r\nto the camp.”\r\n\r\n[1066] “Rusticellus.”\r\n\r\n[1067] Philonides has been already mentioned, B. ii. c. 73, as being in\r\nthe habit of going from Sicyon to Elis in nine hours.—B.\r\n\r\n[1068] We may consult the learned notes of Ajasson, Lemaire, vol. iii.\r\np. 99, respecting the exact distances here indicated by Pliny. We\r\nmay remark, that a stadium is about one-eighth of a mile, according\r\nto which estimate, Philippides must have gone 142 miles in two days,\r\nand the other 150 miles in one day; as it is implied, that these\r\njourneys were performed on foot, even the former of them is obviously\r\nimpossible.—B. Query, however, as to this last assertion; according to\r\nrecent pedestrian feats, it does not appear to be absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\n[1069] See B. ii. c. 72.\r\n\r\n[1070] This feat is no less incredible than those mentioned above.—B.\r\n\r\n[1071] We have an account of this journey of Tiberius in Dion Cassius.\r\nVal. Maximus, B. v. c. 6, also enumerates this among the extraordinary\r\nexamples of fraternal affection.—B. We learn also from Suetonius, that\r\non learning the accident, a fall from his horse, which had happened to\r\nhis brother Drusus, Tiberius took horse at Ticinum, and travelled night\r\nand day till he reached his brother, who was then in Germany, near the\r\nRhine. He accompanied the body to Rome, preceding it on foot all the\r\nway. There is extant a “Consolation to Livia Augusta,” written on this\r\noccasion, some have thought, by Pedo Albinovanus, but it is more likely\r\nto have been the work of Ovid.\r\n\r\n[1072] This statement must have been in some of his lost works.\r\n\r\n[1073] Pliny probably here refers to a passage in the Acad. Quæst. B.\r\niv. c. 81, where Cicero speaks of a person who could see objects, it\r\nwas said, at a distance of 1800 stadia, equal exactly to 125 miles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1074] The actual distance between the promontory of Sicily and the\r\nnearest part of Carthage is between fifty and sixty miles. The acute\r\nvision of Strabo is mentioned by Val. Maximus, B. i. c. 8.—B.\r\n\r\n[1075] See also B. xxxvi. c. 4. He was a Lacedæmonian sculptor, who,\r\naccording to Athenæus, also executed embossed work on vases.\r\n\r\n[1076] His works in ivory were said to have been so small, that they\r\ncould scarcely be seen without placing them on black hair.\r\n\r\n[1077] Cicero, Acad. Quæst. B. iv. c. 120, speaks of “one Myrmecides,\r\na maker of minute objects of art;” Ælian, Vac. Hist. B. i. c. 17, also\r\nspeaks of these minute performances of Myrmecides, and styles them “a\r\nwaste of time.” Pliny, in a subsequent part of his work, B. xxxi. c. 4,\r\nspeaks of similar minute works, executed by these artists in marble;\r\nbut the account which he gives is scarcely credible.—B.\r\n\r\n[1078] See B. xxxvi. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[1079] It would appear that there is a little confusion here of events.\r\nSybaris, so noted for its luxury and effeminacy, was destroyed by the\r\npeople of Crotona, under the command of the athlete Milo, B.C. 510.\r\nIn B.C. 360. the Crotoniats were defeated at the river Sagras, by the\r\nLocrians and Rhegians, 10,000 in number, although they are said to\r\nhave amounted to 130,000. Now it was on the occasion of this _latter\r\nbattle_, that, according to Cicero, De Nat. Deor. B. ii., the noise was\r\nheard at Olympia, where the games were being celebrated. Be it as it\r\nmay, the story is clearly fabulous.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is much more deserving of credit, where we find him stating in\r\nhis Diary, that in his garden, at Say’s Court, at Deptford, he heard\r\nthe guns fired in one of our engagements with the Dutch fleet, at a\r\ndistance thence of nearly 200 miles.]\r\n\r\n[1080] Ajasson discusses at some length, the possibility of the fact\r\nhere mentioned, and concludes, that it is not to be credited: he\r\nestimates the distance between these two places at 120 miles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1081] As to the miraculous annunciation of the victory of Marius and\r\nCatulus over the Cimbri, see B. ii. c. 58.\r\n\r\n[1082] Meaning, thereby, the twin brothers, Castor and Pollux; who were\r\nsaid to have announced at Rome the victory gained the day before by\r\nPaulus Æmilius over King Perseus.\r\n\r\n[1083] This circumstance is mentioned by Pausanias, in his Attica.\r\nShe was an Athenian hetæra, or courtesan, beloved by Aristogiton, or,\r\naccording to Athenæus, by Harmodius. On the murder of Hipparchus, the\r\nson of Pisistratus, she was put to the torture, being supposed to have\r\nbeen privy to the conspiracy; but she died under her sufferings without\r\nmaking any disclosure, and, according to one account, bit off her\r\ntongue, that no secret might be betrayed by her. The Athenians erected\r\nin her honour a bronze statue of a lioness (in reference to her name),\r\nwithout a tongue, in the vestibule of the Acropolis.\r\n\r\n[1084] This story is related by Val. Maximus, B. iii. c. 3, it is also\r\nalluded to by Cicero, Tus. Quæst. B. ii. c. 22, and De Nat. Deor. B.\r\nii. c. 33; but he only speaks of his tortures, without mentioning what\r\nPliny states of his biting off his tongue.—B. He was a philosopher of\r\nAbdera, of the school of Democritus, and flourished about B.C. 340.\r\nTowards Alexander the Great, whom he accompanied into Asia, he acted\r\nthe part of a base flatterer. He was pounded to death in a mortar, by\r\norder of Nicocreon, king of Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[1085] This statement is also made by Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 7.\r\nXenophon, Cyropædia, B. v., speaks of the retentive memory of Cyrus,\r\nbut considerably qualifies the account here given: he says that Cyrus\r\nknew the names of all his commanders or prefects, and of all those to\r\nwhom he had occasion to give particular orders.—B.\r\n\r\n[1086] This account is similar to that given by Val. Maximus, B.\r\nviii. c. 7, and by Aulus Gellius, B. xvii. c. 7. We have a learned\r\ndissertation by Ajasson, in which he discusses the possibility of one\r\nindividual understanding so great a number of languages, as well as the\r\nquestion, whether it is possible that so great a number of languages\r\nwere spoken by the subjects of Mithridates. His conclusions greatly\r\ntend to prove both these points; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 295.—B.\r\n\r\n[1087] This invention is referred to by Cicero, De Nat. Deor., B. ii.\r\nc. 86. Cicero also speaks of the remarkable powers of memory possessed\r\nby Charmidas and Metrodorus, De Oratore, B. ii. c. 88, and Tusc. Quæst.\r\nB. i. c. 24.—B.\r\n\r\n[1088] Ajasson gives an account of some of the principal writers in\r\nwhat has been termed the science of Mnemonics, or artificial memory:\r\nhe particularly commends the lectures of Aimé of Paris on the subject;\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 310, _et seq._—B.\r\n\r\n[1089] This circumstance is related by Val. Maximus, B. i. c. 8.—B.\r\n\r\n[1090] This is not always the case. In dreams we often recollect past\r\nevents and localities; we know in what part of the world we are, and\r\neven remember the substance of former dreams, and the fact that we have\r\ndreamt of a similar subject before.\r\n\r\n[1091] The conqueror of Syracuse, and five times consul at Rome. He was\r\nBorn B.C. 268, and was slain in an engagement with Hannibal, B.C. 208,\r\nin the vicinity of Venusia.\r\n\r\n[1092] Ajasson remarks concerning the number of battles in which\r\nCæsar is said to have been engaged, that it has probably been much\r\nexceeded by some of the great warriors of later times. He says that an\r\nindividual, “who was raised over our heads and over all Europe, and so\r\nreigned much too long,” was personally engaged in nearly 300 battles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1093] Who infested the coasts of Cilicia, and whom he dislodged from\r\ntheir strongholds, and almost utterly extirpated.\r\n\r\n[1094] This fact is mentioned by Seneca, de Ira, B. ii. c. 26. Plutarch\r\nmentions a similar circumstance with respect to Pompey.—B.\r\n\r\n[1095] Or Bacchus.—“Father Liber” is the name always given to him by\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\n[1096] “Magnus.” Plutarch states, that, on his return from Africa,\r\nSylla saluted him with the name of “Magnus,” which surname he ever\r\nafterwards retained.—B.\r\n\r\n[1097] Plutarch says, that the law did not allow a triumph to be\r\ngranted to any one who was not either consul or prætor.—B.\r\n\r\n[1098] Sertorius had joined the party of Marius and Cinna, in\r\nopposition to that of Sylla. He fled into Spain, and maintained the war\r\nsuccessfully in that country, until he was treacherously assassinated\r\nby one of his supposed partisans. This may appear a sufficient reason\r\nfor his not being mentioned by Pompey.—B.\r\n\r\n[1099] “Toties imperator antequam miles.” He had been raised to the\r\nhighest rank without passing through the various gradations of military\r\nlife.—B.\r\n\r\n[1100] Speaking of this honorary crown, Pliny says, B. xvi. c. 4, “At\r\nthe present day it is not given to the victor himself, but proclamation\r\nis made that he confers the crown upon his country.”\r\n\r\n[1101] It is noticed by the commentators, that Aulus Gellius, speaking\r\nof this building, calls it the Temple of Victory, B. x. c. 1; the\r\nerror, it is supposed, may have arisen from Pompey having placed a\r\nstatue of Victory in the Temple.—B.\r\n\r\n[1102] 29th of September.\r\n\r\n[1103] Pliny, referring to these events, in a subsequent place, B.\r\nxxvii. c. 6, says that it took place “pridie Kalend. Octob. die\r\nnatalis sui.” Plutarch informs us, that the triumph lasted two days, a\r\ncircumstance which may assist us in reconciling these dates. The same\r\nauthor gives a very minute detail of all the transactions here referred\r\nto.—B.\r\n\r\n[1104] According to the chronology ordinarily adopted, this would be in\r\nthe year of the City 692.—B.\r\n\r\n[1105] By Asia, as we see from the geographical portion of this work,\r\nthe ancients often designated not the large tract to which we now apply\r\nthe name, but a comparatively small district lying on the east of the\r\nÆgean sea.—B.\r\n\r\n[1106] See B. xiv. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[1107] Val. Maximus adds, that he was the best lawyer of his time.—B.\r\n\r\n[1108] We meet with a passage in Livy, B. xxxix. c. 44, illustrative\r\nof this view of Cato’s character. In Cicero’s treatise, De Senectute,\r\nwhere Cato bears a prominent part, frequent allusion is made to the\r\nstrictness and even severity of his principles, although the general\r\nimpression which we receive of his character and manners is highly\r\ninteresting, and, upon the whole, not unamiable.—B.\r\n\r\n[1109] Plutarch says, that nearly fifty impeachments were brought\r\nagainst him, the last when he was eighty-six years of age.—B.\r\n\r\n[1110] There has been considerable difficulty in ascertaining who was\r\nthe individual here referred to; the subject is discussed at some\r\nlength by Hardouin, who shows that it is probable, that it was Lucius\r\nCæcilius, who was slain in a battle with the Gauls, A.U.C. 470, and in\r\nthe consulship of Dolabella and Domitius.—B.\r\n\r\n[1111] The name of this consul has been the subject of much discussion\r\namong the commentators. Livy, B. iii. c. 31, has been referred to, as\r\ncalling him Atermius; but in some of the best editions, he is named\r\nAterius. The tribunate of Dentatus took place A.U.C. 299, fifty-five\r\nyears after the expulsion of the kings.—B.\r\n\r\n[1112] When a Roman overcame an enemy with whom he had been personally\r\nengaged, he took possession of some part of his armour and dress, which\r\nmight bear testimony to the victory; this was termed the “spolium.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1113] “Hasta pura;” these words, according to Hardouin, signify a\r\nlance without an iron head. We are told that it was given to him who\r\ngained the first victory in a battle; it was also regarded as an emblem\r\nof supreme power, and as a mark of the authority which one nation\r\nclaimed over another.—B.\r\n\r\n[1114] “Phaleris.” These were bosses, discs or crescents of metal,\r\nsometimes gold. They were mostly used in pairs, and as ornaments for\r\nthe helmet; but we more commonly read of them as attached to the\r\nharness of horses, and worn as pendants from the head, so as to produce\r\na terrific effect when shaken by the rapid movements of the horse.\r\n\r\n[1115] The “torques” was an ornament of gold, twisted spirally and bent\r\ninto a circular form, and worn among the upper classes of the Persians,\r\nthe Gauls, and other Asiatic and northern nations. They are often found\r\nboth in France and Ireland, as well as in this country, but varying\r\ngreatly in size and weight.\r\n\r\n[1116] Golden “armillæ,” or bracelets, were worn by the Gauls on the\r\narms and the legs. The Sabines also wore them on the left arm, at the\r\ntime of the foundation of Rome.\r\n\r\n[1117] The word “fiscus” signifies a wicker basket or pannier, probably\r\nof peculiar construction, in which the Romans were accustomed to keep\r\nand carry about large sums of money. In process of time the word came\r\nto signify a treasure or money-chest.\r\n\r\n[1118] We have nearly the same detail of the honours bestowed on\r\nDentatus by Val. Maximus, B. iii. c. 2. Pliny again speaks of Dentatus,\r\nand the honours bestowed upon him, B. xxii. c. 5; and especially\r\nnotices the “corona graminea,” the grass or obsidional crown, as the\r\nhighest of his honours. The different kinds of honorary crowns are\r\nvery fully described in B. xvi. c. 3, 4, and 5; in B. xxii. c. 4, we\r\nhave a particular account of the “corona graminea;” in c. 5, mention\r\nis made of its having been given to Dentatus, and, in the next, other\r\nindividuals are enumerated to whom it had been presented.—B.\r\n\r\n[1119] T. Romilius Rocus Vaticanus was consul B.C. 455. Having defeated\r\nthe Æqui, and gained immense booty, instead of distributing it among\r\nthe soldiers, he and his colleague sold it, on account of the poverty\r\nof the treasury. They were, in consequence, brought to trial, and\r\nVeturius was sentenced to pay 10,000 asses. He was, however, elected\r\naugur in 453, as some compensation for the ill-treatment he had\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\n[1120] Livy, B. iii. c. 31, gives an account of the conviction of\r\nRomilius, but says, that it was effected by C. Claudius Cicero, the\r\ntribune of the people. To obviate the discordance in the names, some\r\ncommentators have proposed to substitute the words “Lucio Siccio” for\r\n“Claudio Cicerone.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1121] We have an account of the victories, honours, and unfortunate\r\nfate of Manlius in Livy, B. vi. c. 14-20. In enumerating the honours\r\nconferred upon him, the numbers are given somewhat differently in c.\r\n20; thirty spoils of enemies slain, forty donations from the generals,\r\ntwo mural and eight civic crowns.—B.\r\n\r\n[1122] M. Sergius Silus. He was one of the city prætors B.C. 197.\r\n\r\n[1123] Among the Jews and other nations of antiquity, it was considered\r\nan essential point for the priests to be without blemish, perfect and\r\nfree from disease.—B.\r\n\r\n[1124] In allusion to the compliment paid by the senate to the consul,\r\nM. Terentius Varro, by whose rashness the battle of Cannæ was lost.\r\nOn his escape and safe return to Rome, instead of visiting him with\r\ncensure, he received the thanks of the senate, “that he had not\r\ndespaired of the Republic.”\r\n\r\n[1125] It appears somewhat remarkable, considering the extraordinary\r\nacts of valour here enumerated, as performed by Sergius, that we hear\r\nso little of him from other sources.—B.\r\n\r\n[1126] Hardouin takes the meaning to be, that though ill fortune\r\novertook the Romans in their wars with Hannibal, nevertheless Sergius\r\ndefeated Fortune herself, in dying before his country was overwhelmed\r\nby those calamities.\r\n\r\n[1127] Pliny informs us, B. xiii. c. 1, that the art of making perfumes\r\noriginated with the Persians.—B.\r\n\r\n[1128] The city was taken by him by assault, and all its buildings,\r\nwith the exception of the house of Pindar, levelled to the ground; most\r\nof the inhabitants were slaughtered, and the rest sold as slaves.\r\n\r\n[1129] Stagirus, or Stagira, a town of Macedonia, in Chalcidice, on\r\nthe Strymonic Gulf. It was a colony of Andros, founded B.C. 656,\r\nand originally called Orthagoria. It was destroyed by Philip, and,\r\naccording to some accounts, was rebuilt by _him_, as having been the\r\nnative place of Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[1130] Archilochus of Paros was one of the earliest Ionian lyric\r\npoets, and was the first who composed in Iambic verse according to\r\nfixed rules. He flourished about 714-676 B.C. Pliny speaks here of\r\nhis murderers; but it is generally stated by historians that he was\r\nmurdered by one individual by some called Calondas, or Corax, a Naxian,\r\nby others Archias.\r\n\r\n[1131] We may here refer to some remarks by Hardouin and Ajasson on the\r\nactual sum obtained by Isocrates; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 126, 127.—B.\r\n\r\n[1132] This anecdote is related by Cicero, De Oratore, B. iii. c. 56,\r\nand by Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 10.—B.\r\n\r\n[1133] This is rather a strong expression, and it is doubtful if the\r\ngreat historian at all deserves it. The facts of the case seem to\r\nhave been as follow. Thucydides was employed in a military capacity,\r\nand was in command of an Athenian squadron of seven ships at Thasos,\r\nB.C. 424, when Eucles, who commanded in Amphipolis, sent for his\r\nassistance against Brasidas, who was before that town with an army.\r\nFearing the arrival of a superior force, Brasidas offered favourable\r\nterms to Amphipolis, which were readily accepted, as there were but few\r\nAthenians in the place. Thucydides arrived at Eion, on the mouth of the\r\nStrymon, the evening of the same day on which Amphipolis surrendered:\r\nand though too late to save Amphipolis, prevented Eion from falling\r\ninto the hands of the enemy. It was in consequence of this failure,\r\nthat he became voluntarily an exile, perhaps to avoid the still severer\r\npunishment of death, which appears to have been the penalty of such a\r\nfailure as that which he had, though unavoidably, committed. It is most\r\nprobable that he returned to Athens about B.C. 403, the period of its\r\nliberation by Thrasybulus.\r\n\r\n[1134] The following passage in Livy, B. vi. c. 34, may serve to\r\nillustrate this remark of Pliny:—“The lictors of Sulpicius, the\r\nmilitary tribune, when he went home from the forum, knocked at the door\r\nwith his staff, as the usual custom is.”\r\n\r\n[1135] Of Cyrene, the Academic philosopher. In B.C. 155, being then\r\nfifty-eight years old, he was chosen with some others to deprecate\r\nthe fine of 500 talents which had been imposed on the Athenians for\r\nthe destruction of Oropus. It was then that, in presence of Cato the\r\nElder, he delivered his famous orations on Justice. The first oration\r\nwas in commendation of the virtue, and on the ensuing day the next was\r\ndelivered, by which all the arguments of the first were answered, and\r\njustice shown to be not a virtue, but only a matter of compact for the\r\nmaintenance of civil society. The honesty of Cato was greatly shocked\r\nat this, and he moved the senate to send the philosopher back to his\r\nschool, and save the Roman youth from his demoralizing doctrines. He\r\nlived twenty-eight years after this, and died at Athens B.C. 129, aged\r\neighty-five, or, according to Cicero, ninety.\r\n\r\n[1136] This is related by Plutarch, in his Life of Cato. His general\r\ndislike of the Grecian character is again mentioned, B. xxix. c. 7.—B.\r\n\r\n[1137] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1138] We have an account of this embassy in Plutarch. Pliny informs\r\nus, B. xxxiv. c. 20, that the only article which Cato retained, of\r\nthe works of art that he brought from Cyprus, was the statue of Zeno,\r\n“not for its intrinsic merit, but because it was the statue of a\r\nphilosopher.” Valerius Paterculus, B. ii. c. 45, and Plutarch refer to\r\nthis transaction.—B.\r\n\r\n[1139] This circumstance is related by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c.\r\n14, and is referred to by Cicero in his defence of Archias, sec. 9.—B.\r\n\r\n[1140] M. Varro, the philosopher, sometimes called “the most learned”\r\nof the Romans. His command under Pompey, in the war against the\r\nPirates, has been already mentioned in B. iii. c. 16. He also served\r\nunder him against Mithridates, and was his legatus in Spain, at the\r\nfirst outbreak of the civil wars.\r\n\r\n[1141] Pliny refers to the same subject: in B. xxxv. c. 2, he speaks\r\nof Pollio as “qui primus, bibliothecam dicando, ingenia hominum\r\nrempublicam fecit”—“The first who, by forming a public library, made\r\npublic property the genius of learned men.” Aulus Gellius, B. vi.\r\nc. 18, informs us, that the first library, formed for the use of\r\nthe public, was that collected at Athens by Pisistratus.—B. Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, the king of Pergamus, and Lucullus, had formed extensive\r\nlibraries, but solely for their own use, and not that of the public.\r\n\r\n[1142] Some of these are given by Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 15.—B. It\r\nis very doubtful, however, if Greece did not greatly excel Rome in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n[1143] Meaning Cicero, the orator and philosopher.\r\n\r\n[1144] Cicero, in an Epistle to Atticus, B. ii. c. i., enumerates what\r\nhe styles his consular orations: the total number is twelve, and among\r\nthem we find all those here referred to by Pliny.—B.\r\n\r\n[1145] The individual referred to is L. Roscius Otho; by his law the\r\nRoman equites, who, before this time, sat mingled with the people\r\ngenerally, had appropriate seats allotted to them. Cicero designates\r\nthis oration, “De Othone.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1146] This title was bestowed upon him by the general acclamation of\r\nthe people, at the end of his consulship. We have an account of it in\r\nPlutarch.—B.\r\n\r\n[1147] This remark is not found in any of Cæsar’s works now extant.—B.\r\n\r\n[1148] These terms signify “acute” and “judicious;” they are derived\r\nrespectively from “cautus” and “cor.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1149] Son of Damagetus, and one of the Seven Sages. He flourished\r\ntowards the beginning of the sixth century B.C. Herodotus says that he\r\nheld the office of Ephor Eponymus in Ol. 56. He was a man remarkable\r\nfor his wisdom and his sententious brevity, so characteristic of his\r\nSpartan origin.\r\n\r\n[1150] It appears somewhat doubtful to which of the Grecian sages the\r\ncredit of this maxim is due.—B.\r\n\r\n[1151] We have an account of Melampus, probably the same as the person\r\nhere styled Melampodes, in Herodotus, B. ii. c. 49, and B. ix. c. 34;\r\nAjasson, in Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 135, has given a list of writers who\r\nhave referred to him as an eminent soothsayer. Pliny mentions him in a\r\nsubsequent passage, B. xxv. c. 21, as celebrated for his skill in the\r\nart of divination.—B.\r\n\r\n[1152] Marcius is said by Cicero, De Divin. B. i. c. 50, to have given\r\nhis predictions in verses.—B.\r\n\r\n[1153] We have an account of this in Livy, B. xxix. c. 14, and B.\r\nxxxvi. c. 40; it is also referred to by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c.\r\n15.—B.\r\n\r\n[1154] In consequence of the number of eminent men who bore the name\r\nof Scipio, it is not easy, in all cases, to decide to which of them\r\ncertain transactions ought to be referred. In this instance, it\r\nhas been doubted, whether it was the same Scipio who was twice an\r\nunsuccessful candidate for the consulship, and who died in a foreign\r\ncountry. Livy, B. xxxv. c. 24, remarks, “P. Corn. Cn. F. Scipio” had\r\nbeen an unsuccessful candidate for the consulship; and afterwards, B.\r\nxxxix. c. 40, that “P. and L. Scipio” were unsuccessful candidates for\r\nthe office of censor. Val. Maximus expressly states, B. v. c. 3, that\r\nit was Scipio Nasica, who, in consequence of the little estimation in\r\nwhich he was held by his fellow-citizens, went to Pergamus, and “lived\r\nthere the remainder of his life, without feeling any regrets for his\r\nungrateful country.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1155] We have this anecdote related by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c.\r\n15. He informs us, that it was the statue of Venus Verticordia which\r\nwas ordered to be consecrated; the more readily to win the hearts of\r\nthe maidens and matrons from wanton thoughts to a life of chastity.—B.\r\n\r\n[1156] Her story is told at great length by Ovid, in the Fasti, B. iv.\r\nl. 305, _et seq._ Her name was Claudia Quinta, and she is supposed to\r\nhave been the sister of Appius Claudius Pulcher, and grand-daughter\r\nof Appius Claudius Cæcus. The vessel which was conveying the statue\r\nof Cybele from Pessinus to Rome having stuck fast on a shallow at the\r\nmouth of the Tiber, the soothsayers declared that none but a really\r\nchaste woman could move it. Claudia, who had been previously accused\r\nof unchastity, being in the number of the matrons who had accompanied\r\nScipio to Ostia to receive the statue, immediately presented herself,\r\nand calling upon the goddess to vindicate her innocence, seized the\r\nrope, and the vessel moved forthwith. A statue was afterwards erected\r\nto her in the vestibule of the temple of the goddess.\r\n\r\n[1157] Solinus and Festus differ somewhat from Pliny, in stating\r\nthat it was her father whose life was thus saved by the affectionate\r\ndaughter. Valerius Maximus, who tells the story, says that the family\r\nwas “ingenui sanguinis,” meaning “of genteel origin.” Such families\r\nwere, however, sometimes reduced, even among the Romans, to a level\r\nwith the plebeian classes.\r\n\r\n[1158] A.U.C. 604.\r\n\r\n[1159] This theatre is again mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 12. It was built\r\nof stone, and erected by Augustus in honour of his nephew Marcellus.\r\nThis is related by Valerius Maximus, B. v. c. 8, somewhat more in\r\ndetail, and with a degree of animation, which is not frequently to be\r\nmet with in that author.—B.\r\n\r\n[1160] Cicero, De Divin. B. i. c. 18, Val. Maximus, B. iv. c. 6, and\r\nPlutarch, relate this more circumstantially. The serpents were of\r\ndifferent sexes; if the male serpent was killed, his own death was to\r\nbe the consequence; if the female, that of his wife, Cornelia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1161] Pliny gives an account of the circumstances which attended\r\nthe death of Lepidus, in the 54th Chapter. He was the father of the\r\ntriumvir.—B.\r\n\r\n[1162] Or Rutilius, consul B.C. 132, the year after the death of\r\nTiberius Gracchus, whose adherents he prosecuted with the greatest\r\ncruelty. He also obtained a triumph for bringing to a conclusion the\r\nServile war. He was an intimate friend of the younger Scipio Africanus,\r\nwho obtained the consulship for him, but failed in gaining that honour\r\nfor his brother Lucius. About the same period, he was condemned, in the\r\ntribuneship of Caius Gracchus, for his illegal acts in the prosecution\r\nof the adherents of Tiberius Gracchus. It has been suggested that this\r\nindignity may have had a greater share than the ill success of his\r\nbrother in causing his death.\r\n\r\n[1163] Pliny again speaks of the great talents of Hippocrates, B. xxvi.\r\nc. 6, and B. xxix. c. 2.—B.\r\n\r\n[1164] We have an account of the origin of these games in Livy, B.\r\nxxix. c. 14.—B.\r\n\r\n[1165] Cleombrotus is supposed to be the same person who is mentioned\r\nin B. xxix. c. 3, as Erasistratus, the grandson of Aristotle. From\r\nSuidas we learn that a near relative of his was called Cleombrotus,\r\nthough, from his perplexed language, it is impossible to say whether\r\nfather or uncle. The story to which Pliny is supposed here to refer\r\nis a curious one. Antiochus, the son of Seleucus Nicator, fell in\r\nlove with Stratonice, whom his father had married in his old age, but\r\nstruggled to conceal his passion. The skilful physician discovered\r\nthe nature of his disease; upon which he reported to Seleucus that it\r\nwas incurable, for that he was in love, and it was impossible that\r\nhis passion could be gratified. The king, greatly surprised, inquired\r\nwho the lady was; to which Erasistratus replied that it was his own\r\nwife; whereupon Seleucus began to try and persuade him to give her\r\nup to his son. The physician upon this asked him if he would do so\r\nhimself, if it were his own wife. Seleucus declared that he would;\r\nupon which Erasistratus disclosed to him the truth. Seleucus not only\r\ngave up Stratonice to his son, but resigned to him several provinces.\r\nErasistratus was one of the most famous physicians and anatomists of\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n[1166] It was on this occasion that a label was said to have been\r\nfastened on the arrow, inscribed, “To Philip’s right eye.” The\r\ninhabitants were permitted to depart, however, when the city was taken,\r\nwith one garment to each person.\r\n\r\n[1167] This accident occurred to Philip, at the siege of Methone, of\r\nwhich we have a brief account in Diodorus Siculus, B. xvi. c. 7, and in\r\nJustin, B. vii. c. 6; but neither of these authors makes any mention of\r\nCritobulus. Quintus Curtius, B. ix. c. 5, informs us, that Critobulus\r\nexhibited great skill in relieving Alexander the Great from the effects\r\nof a dangerous wound, which he received in India; but he does not refer\r\nto the fact here mentioned.—B.\r\n\r\n[1168] At the present day, this mode of treatment would have figured as\r\nthe “wine-cure.”\r\n\r\n[1169] See B. xxvi. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[1170] Pliny again speaks of Asclepiades, in B. xxvi. c. 7, and B.\r\nxxix. c. 5. The anecdote respecting the man who was saved from the\r\nfuneral pile is referred to by Celsus, B. ii. c. 6.—B. Pliny says,\r\nin B. xxvi. c. 7, that Asclepiades first came to Rome as a teacher\r\nof rhetoric, and that being unsuccessful, he turned his attention\r\nto medicine. Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller, also met his death by\r\nfalling down stairs. Rabelais, in the prologue to his Fourth Book,\r\nrefers to this peculiar death of Asclepiades.\r\n\r\n[1171] This is related more at large by Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 7,\r\nand by Plutarch.—B.\r\n\r\n[1172] Mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1173] Val. Maximus refers to Philon and his public works, in B.\r\nviii. c. 12.—B. He was an architect of eminence in the reign of the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander. He built for Demetrius Phalereus, about\r\nB.C. 318, the portico of twelve Doric columns to the great temple at\r\nEleusis. He also formed a basin in the Piræus, which was destroyed at\r\nthe taking of Athens by the Romans under Sylla.\r\n\r\n[1174] See B. v. c. 11, and B. xxxiv. c. 42.\r\n\r\n[1175] Plutarch, in his life of Alexander, mentions the restriction\r\nmade in favour of Lysippus, but does not extend it to Apelles; he\r\ndoes not speak of Pyrgoteles. We have an apposite allusion to this\r\ncircumstance by Horace, Ep. B. i. l. 239, 240. Boileau has elegantly\r\nimitated Horace, in his “Discours au Roi.”—B. For further particulars\r\nof him, see B. xxxiv. c. 17 and 19. He was a native of Sicyon, and at\r\nfirst a simple worker in bronze, but eventually obtained the highest\r\nrank among the Grecian statuaries.\r\n\r\n[1176] According to the usual estimate of the value of the Attic\r\ntalent, £193 12_s._, the sum given for this picture would be about\r\n£19,000.—B.\r\n\r\n[1177] Nearly all the topics here treated of are again mentioned in\r\nB. xxxv., which is devoted to the fine arts. The 34th, 35th, and\r\n36th Chapters of that Book, contain an account of all the celebrated\r\npainters of antiquity, and their principal works.—B.\r\n\r\n[1178] Between £15,000 and £16,000.—B.\r\n\r\n[1179] “Poliorcetes.”\r\n\r\n[1180] We have a further account of this artist in B. xxxiv. c. 19, B.\r\nxxxv. c. 39 and 40, and B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1181] This is referred to by Pliny, B. xxxvi. c. 4, and by Valerius\r\nMaximus, B. viii. c. 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[1182] He is again mentioned in B. xxxiv. c. 19, B. xxxv. c. 34, and B.\r\nxxxvi. c. 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[1183] Mentor is noticed for his skill in carving, B. xxxiii. c.\r\n55.—B. Littrè says, on referring to that passage, “we find that he was\r\na worker in silver, and a maker of vases of great value.” He seems\r\ndisinclined to believe that he was a statuary. As Pliny tells us, _ubi\r\nsupra_, none of his public works were in existence in Pliny’s time.\r\nSome small cups, however, existed, which were highly prized, though\r\nsome were undoubtedly spurious.\r\n\r\n[1184] Now Pesaro.\r\n\r\n[1185] We have the same difficulty in ascertaining the sums here\r\nmentioned, as in all former cases. Holland estimates the sum given for\r\nDaphnus at 300,700 sesterces, vol. i. p. 175.—B.\r\n\r\n[1186] “Dispensator;” we have an explanation of this term, B. xxxiii.\r\nc. 13.—B.\r\n\r\n[1187] Holland estimates the sum paid for the enfranchisement of this\r\nman at 120,000 sesterces, vol. i. p. 175.—B.\r\n\r\n[1188] In his capacity, probably, of contractor for provisions and\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n[1189] Holland estimates the price paid on this occasion at 3,500\r\nsesterces, _ubi supra_, thus differing exceedingly from Ajasson’s\r\nestimate.—B.\r\n\r\n[1190] “Quam quidam injuriam lucri fecit ille mercatus in luctu\r\ncivitatis, quoniam arguere nulli vacabat.” We can see the meaning of\r\nthis passage, but a literal translation of it, as it stands, is out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n[1191] “Virtus”—“manliness,” that being esteemed by the Romans the\r\nideal of true virtue.\r\n\r\n[1192] It appears that a similar custom prevailed among the Scythians,\r\naccording to Phylarchus, from whom Pliny probably took his account of\r\nit; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 151.\r\n\r\n[1193] As being fraught with an intensity of pain, which no number of\r\ndays passed in pleasure can compensate.\r\n\r\n[1194] She was the daughter of Leotychides, and the wife of Archidamas,\r\nand mother of Ægis. Ajasson expresses his surprise, that so diligent\r\na collector of facts as Pliny, should have been acquainted with only\r\none example of this kind.—B. “The following are additional instances\r\ncollected by Ajasson:—1. Olympias, daughter of Neoptolemus, king of\r\nEpirus, wife of Philip II., king of Macedon, and mother of Alexander\r\nthe Great, king of Macedon. 2. Roxana, daughter of king Darius\r\nCodomannus, and wife of Alexander the Great; her son by whom was\r\nproclaimed king by certain generals of Alexander, but was shortly after\r\nslain at Amphipolis. 3. Laodice the Younger, daughter of king Antiochus\r\nSoter, sister and wife of Antiochus Theös, and mother of king Seleucus\r\nCallinicus. 4. Berenice, daughter of king Ptolemy Philadelphus;\r\nmarried to her brother king Ptolemy Euergetes, and mother of Ptolemy\r\nPhilopater, by whom she was put to death. 5. Cleopatra, daughter of\r\nAntiochus the Great, king of Syria: she became the wife of king Ptolemy\r\nEpiphanes, and was mother of king Ptolemy Philometor. 6. Cleopatra\r\nCocce, daughter of Ptolemy Philometor, married her uncle, king Ptolemy\r\nPhyscon, and became mother of kings Ptolemy Lathyrus and Alexander I.\r\n7. Cleopatra, another daughter of Ptolemy Philometor, married first\r\nto Alexander Balas, the usurper of the throne of Scythia, then to\r\nking Demetrius Nicator, and then to Antiochus Venator. Her sons by\r\nNicator were Seleucus V. and Antiochus Gryphus, both of whom became\r\nkings of Syria; and her son Cyzicenius by Antiochus Venator, likewise\r\nbecame king of Syria. 8. Selene or Cleopatra, daughter of king Ptolemy\r\nPhyscon, was married, first, to king Ptolemy Lathyrus, secondly, to\r\nking Antiochus Gryphus, and thirdly, to king Antiochus Eusebes. She\r\nwas mother of king Antiochus Asiaticus. In all, she had nine kings as\r\nher near relations or connections. 9. Stratonice, daughter of king\r\nDemetrius Poliorcetes, was married first to king Seleucus Nicator, and\r\nthen to king Antiochus Soter, and was mother of king Antiochus Therös.\r\n\r\n[1195] Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 15, gives nearly the same account of a\r\nperson whom he calls Pherenice; from the resemblance of the names, it\r\nhas been supposed, that they may both refer to the same individual.—B.\r\n\r\n[1196] He alludes to the three persons, father, son, and grandson,\r\nknown by the name of C. Scribonius Curio. The first was prætor B.C.\r\n121, one of the most distinguished orators of his time. His son, who\r\nacquired some reputation as an orator, was tribune of the people B.C.\r\n90, prætor B.C. 82, and consul in B.C. 76, with Cn. Octavius. He is\r\nrepresented as being possessed of great eloquence, and of extreme\r\npurity and brilliancy of diction, but to have had none of the other\r\nrequisites of an orator. Like his son, he enjoyed the friendship of\r\nCicero. The younger Curio was an orator of great talents, which, from\r\nwant of industry, he left uncultivated. Cicero endeavoured to direct\r\nhis talents into a proper channel, but all in vain, and he remained to\r\nthe end a man of worthless and profligate character. He was married to\r\nFulvia, who afterwards became the wife of Antony.\r\n\r\n[1197] Hardouin observes, that M. Fabius Ambustus was three times\r\nconsul, Quintus Fabius Rullianus five times, and Q. Fabius Gurges three\r\ntimes.—B.\r\n\r\n[1198] We have a similar account of the fate of Fidustius in Dion\r\nCassius, by whom he is named Filuscius.—B. He was at length slain by\r\norder of Antony.\r\n\r\n[1199] We have an account of the vicissitudes in the life of Ventidius\r\nBassus in A. Gellius, B. xv. c. 4, and in Valerius Paterculus, B. ii.\r\nc. 65. We learn from these writers, that Ventidius was a native of\r\nPicenum, and that, when that city was taken by Cneius Pompeius, in the\r\nSocial war, Ventidius, then an infant, was carried in his mother’s\r\narms, before the car of the conqueror.—B.\r\n\r\n[1200] The passage of Cicero referred to, occurs in a letter to\r\nPlancus, Ep. ad Fam. B. x. Ep. 18, where, speaking of Ventidius, who\r\nhad united himself to the party of Antony, he says, “And I look down\r\nupon the camp of the mule-driver, Ventidius.”\r\n\r\n[1201] “Caliga.” A strong heavy sandal worn by the Roman soldiers and\r\ncenturions; but not by the superior officers. The term “a caligâ,”\r\ntherefore, had the same meaning as our expression, “from the ranks.”\r\nThe Emperor Caligula received that surname when a boy, in consequence\r\nof wearing the caliga, and being inured to the life of a common soldier.\r\n\r\n[1202] In the year A.U.C. 704.\r\n\r\n[1203] He was a native of Gades, in Spain. A party of the Roman nobles\r\ninduced an inhabitant of Gades to accuse him of having illegally\r\nassumed the privileges of a Roman citizen. The cause was tried B.C. 55,\r\nand he was supported by Pompey and Crassus, and defended by Cicero. One\r\nof the tests of the being a Roman citizen, was the immunity from being\r\nscourged, according to the provisions of the Porcian law. So St. Paul,\r\nwho, as a citizen of Tarsus, enjoyed the rights of a Roman citizen,\r\nsays to the centurion, Acts xxii. 25, “Is it lawful for you to scourge\r\na man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?”\r\n\r\n[1204] The accusation against Balbus appears to have been his illegal\r\nusurpation of the rights of a Roman citizen, being born a foreigner.\r\nPliny has previously informed us, B. v. c. 5, that he was a native of\r\nGades or Cadiz. He was elected consul A.U.C. 713.—B.\r\n\r\n[1205] L. Fulvius Curius, consul B.C. 322. In B.C. 313 he was master of\r\nthe horse to the dictator, L. Æmilius.\r\n\r\n[1206] “Felix.” Hardouin informs us, that he transmitted this surname\r\nto his descendants; among them was Felix, the governor of Judæa, before\r\nwhom St. Paul was taken for judgment.—B.\r\n\r\n[1207] “Infelix.”\r\n\r\n[1208] According to Pliny, B. xi. c. 39, and Plutarch, Sylla was\r\naffected by what has been termed the “Morbus pediculosus” or “Lousy\r\ndisease.” Plutarch, however, ascribes his death to the bursting of an\r\ninternal abscess; and the same cause is assigned by Val. Maximus, B.\r\nix. c. 3.—B. It was probably of a similar disease that Herod Agrippa\r\ndied, whom we find mentioned in Acts xii. 23, as being eaten of worms.\r\n\r\n[1209] Plutarch refers to a dream which Sylla had a short time before\r\nhis death, but it does not seem to correspond to the one here alluded\r\nto.—B. “Plutarch relates that shortly before his death, Sylla dreamed\r\nthat his son Cornelius, who died before his wife, Cecilia Metella,\r\nappeared to him, and summoned him away to join his mother. Appian also\r\nstates that just before his death, Sylla beheld a spirit in a dream,\r\nwhich summoned him by name; upon which he called together his friends,\r\nmade his will, and died soon after of a fever. Only two days before\r\nhis death he finished the twenty-second book of his Memoirs, in which,\r\nforeseeing his end, he boasted of the prediction of the Chaldæans, that\r\nit was his fate to die after a happy life, and in the height of his\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n[1210] This is referred to by Tacitus, Hist. B. iii. c. 73.—B. Plutarch\r\ntells us that Catulus performed this ceremony of dedication.\r\n\r\n[1211] His consulships were A.U.C. 502 and 506.—B.\r\n\r\n[1212] Hardouin informs us, that a certain number of public officers,\r\nwhich varied from three to twenty, were appointed to divide the lands\r\nof the conquered people among the Roman colonists. Lemaire, vol. iii.\r\np. 159.—B.\r\n\r\n[1213] The commentators have endeavoured to prove, and not without\r\nsome success, that Pliny is not correct in the remark, that the first\r\nelephants brought to Rome, were those which followed in the triumph of\r\nMetellus. He has himself informed us, B. viii. c. 6, that they were\r\nintroduced by Curius Dentatus, in his triumph over Pyrrhus, some years\r\nbefore that of Metellus. The same fact is also stated by Florus, B. i.\r\nc. 18.—B.\r\n\r\n[1214] Ovid, Fast. B. vi. l. 436, _et seq._, and Val. Maximus, B. i. c.\r\n4, allude to this circumstance.—B.\r\n\r\n[1215] This fact has been supposed by Hardouin to be controverted by\r\nthe statement of Aulus Gellius, who says, B. iii. c. 18, that all the\r\nsenators, who had passed the curule chair, were carried to the curia or\r\nsenate-house, in a chariot. But, as Ajasson correctly observes, Aulus\r\nGellius does not assert that the senators were carried at the public\r\nexpense, which was the case with Metellus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1216] Val. Maximus, B. vii. c. 1, details the various fortunate\r\ncircumstances which occurred to Q. Metellus; he makes no mention,\r\nhowever, of the violent attack made upon him by Labeo; indeed, he\r\nexpressly states, that his good fortune continued to the last moments\r\nof his life.—B.\r\n\r\n[1217] Val. Maximus, _ubi supra_, and Velleius Paterculus, B. i. c. 11,\r\nspeak of the honours obtained by the four sons of Q. Metellus; they are\r\nalso alluded to by Cicero in his 8th Philippic, sec. 4., and his Tusc.\r\nQuæst. B. i. c. 35.—B.\r\n\r\n[1218] Dalechamps remarks, that we find in the ancient historians a\r\nsimilar account relative to M. Drusus, who, when tribune of the people,\r\nhurried off the consul Philippus with such violence to prison, that the\r\nblood started from his nostrils: also of P. Sempronius, the tribune\r\nof the people, who, had it not been for the opposition offered by his\r\ncolleague, would have carried the censor Appius Claudius to prison.\r\n\r\n[1219] This attack of Labeo on Metellus is mentioned in the Epitome\r\nof Livy, B. lix. The tribunes of Rome were styled “sacrosancti,” and\r\nit was considered a capital crime to offer personal violence to them,\r\nunder any circumstances. Hardouin remarks, that the tribune who came\r\nto the rescue of Metellus must have been a military tribune, who, in\r\nvirtue of his office, had a right to claim the services of Metellus for\r\nthe army.—B.\r\n\r\n[1220] Cicero, in his oration “Pro Domo suâ,” sec. 47, refers to the\r\nconsecration of the property of Metellus, as a case analogous to that\r\nof his own house, which had been similarly consecrated by Clodius.—B.\r\nIt seems to have been the custom, when a person had been capitally\r\ncondemned, for the tribune of the people to consecrate his property,\r\nwith certain formalities, to some god or goddess; after which it could\r\nnot, under ordinary circumstances, be recovered, whether the sentence\r\nwas revoked or not. Cicero had been capitally condemned through the\r\ninstrumentality of Clodius, and obliged to fly from Rome.\r\n\r\n[1221] It was a common expression among the Romans, for a person,\r\n“obtorto collo ad prætorem trahi,” “to be dragged to the prætor with\r\nhis neck wrenched;” and we meet with it repeatedly in the writings\r\nof Plautus. It would appear that it was customary for the lictors or\r\nofficers of justice to seize criminals in a peculiar manner, perhaps\r\nwith a rope, and with the exercise of great violence, whatever their\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n[1222] According to the remark of Dalechamps, it appears to have been\r\nnot unusual with the Roman magistrates, when resistance was offered to\r\ntheir order, to seize the party by the throat, as is here stated to\r\nhave been done by Labeo.—B.\r\n\r\n[1223] There has been considerable difficulty in ascertaining the names\r\nwhich should be given to the sons of Metellus, as the MSS. differ, and\r\nthere appears to be no means of coming to any accurate decision, by a\r\nreference to other authorities. The essential circumstance, however,\r\nis, that two of the sons had obtained the honour of a triumph, and\r\nhad acquired appropriate surnames.—B. Metellus Diadematus has been\r\nmuch confounded with his cousin, Metellus Dalmaticus. Diadematus was\r\nso called, from his wearing, for a long time, a bandage round his\r\nforehead, in consequence of an ulcer. He was consul B.C. 117.\r\n\r\n[1224] By being dragged, and not proceeding willingly, in order to\r\ngain time for succour, and so save himself from being hurled from the\r\nTarpeian rock.\r\n\r\n[1225] Which allowed the laws to take their course, even against an\r\nindividual of the first consequence in the state.—B.\r\n\r\n[1226] In the class of those who were considered peculiarly fortunate;\r\n“hâc censurâ,” literally, “in this assessment,” in allusion to the\r\nclassification of the citizens of Rome, according to the estimate of\r\ntheir property.—B.\r\n\r\n[1227] In B.C. 45, when, being but about eighteen years of age, he had\r\nthe presumption to ask his uncle for the office of “magister equitum;”\r\nupon which Julius Cæsar bestowed it on M. Lepidus, probably being of\r\nopinion that his nephew was not yet fit for the office.\r\n\r\n[1228] In his triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus, he showed himself no\r\nless cruel than his colleague, Antony, notwithstanding the gloss which\r\nPliny attempts to throw over his actions. Two thousand equites and\r\nthree hundred senators are said to have been put to death during this\r\nproscription.\r\n\r\n[1229] Augustus was detained at Dyrrhachium for some time before the\r\nbattle of Philippi by illness, and had not recovered when the battle\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\n[1230] In the first engagement at Philippi, Brutus defeated the army of\r\nAugustus, while Cassius was defeated by Antony. Appian speaks also of\r\nhis concealment in a marsh to the south of Philippi.\r\n\r\n[1231] In his war against Sextus Pompeius, his fleet was twice\r\nshattered by shipwreck off the coast of Sicily, and he suffered several\r\ndefeats by sea.\r\n\r\n[1232] C. Proculeius, a member of the equestrian order, and a familiar\r\nfriend of Augustus. It is of him that Horace speaks in the lines (II.\r\nOde 2),\r\n\r\n  “Vivet extento Proculeius ævo\r\n  Notus in fratres animi paterni.”\r\n\r\nHe was one of the Romans to whom Augustus thought of giving his\r\ndaughter Julia in marriage. The mode of his death is mentioned in B.\r\nxxxvi. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[1233] This circumstance is stated more fully by Suetonius in his\r\nLife of Augustus; he tells, that “in crossing from Sicily to Italy to\r\nrejoin his forces, Augustus was unexpectedly attacked by Demochares and\r\nApollophanes, two of Pompey’s captains, and only escaped in a small\r\nvessel with the greatest difficulty.”\r\n\r\n[1234] L. Antonius having raised an army at Præneste, took possession\r\nof the town of Perusia, which was blockaded by Augustus, and Antonius\r\nwas at last obliged to surrender. During this siege Augustus\r\nencountered several dangers, and was once nearly killed while\r\nsacrificing beneath the walls, by a band of gladiators, who came upon\r\nhim unawares.\r\n\r\n[1235] The victory was long doubtful, and it was only the sudden panic\r\nof Cleopatra, that finally ensured it to Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1236] The exact nature of the accident here alluded to, is discussed\r\nby Hardouin, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 169; he concludes, from the account\r\nof Suetonius and of Dion Cassius, that it was owing to the fall of a\r\ngallery, which extended between two towers.—B.\r\n\r\n[1237] These are fully described by Suetonius, in his Life of Augustus,\r\nc. 80 and 81.\r\n\r\n[1238] M. Claudius Marcellus, the son of Octavia, sister of Augustus.\r\nHe was adopted by Augustus. Tacitus seems to hint that he was greatly\r\nbeloved by the Roman people, and it is not improbable that Augustus may\r\nhave become suspicious or jealous of him; his decease took place in his\r\ntwentieth year.\r\n\r\n[1239] To Mitylene. This refers to the jealousy between Marcellus\r\nand his brother-in-law, M. Vipsanius Agrippa. Pliny probably uses\r\nthe term “pudenda,” implying that Augustus showed neither firmness\r\nnor gratitude on this occasion; for anxious, at any cost, to prevent\r\nthese differences, he sent Agrippa, against his will, as proconsul to\r\nSyria; immediately on which Agrippa left Rome, but stopped at Mitylene,\r\nand left the government of Syria to his legatus. Upon the death of\r\nMarcellus, Agrippa returned to Rome.\r\n\r\n[1240] Dion Cassius mentions three conspiracies, the first by Fabius\r\nCæpio and Muræna, a second, of which he does not name the authors, and\r\na third by Cornelius Cinna.\r\n\r\n[1241] Said in allusion to the suspicious deaths of his grandchildren\r\nLucius and Caius, the children of his daughter Julia by Agrippa.\r\nThey were probably removed by the criminal acts of Livia; but some\r\nhistorians have hinted that Augustus was privy to their destruction,\r\nthe object of which was to remove all obstacles that lay in the way of\r\nTiberius to the throne.\r\n\r\n[1242] Implying that he was conscience-stricken at his share in their\r\ndeath, as well as struck with sorrow and remorse.\r\n\r\n[1243] She was his only child; Scribonia was her mother. She was\r\nfirst married to her cousin Marcellus; on his death to L. Vipsanius\r\nAgrippa, and after his decease to Tiberius Nero, the son of Livia.\r\nHer profligacy was universally known, and Augustus did not scruple to\r\nenlarge upon it before the senate; but Pliny is the only writer who\r\nstates that she contemplated an attempt on the life of his father;\r\nthough Suetonius says that she became, at a late period of her reign,\r\nan object of interest to those who were disaffected. Julia was first\r\nbanished to Pandataria, off the coast of Campania, and then to Rhegium,\r\nwhich she was never allowed to leave. Her death took place A.D. 14.\r\n\r\n[1244] Tiberius Nero, afterwards emperor. Pliny here alludes to his\r\nretirement to Rhodes, where he remained seven years. Tacitus represents\r\nthat his chief reason for leaving Rome was to escape the society of\r\nhis wife Julia, who treated him with the utmost contempt, and whose\r\nlicentious life was not unknown to him. During this retreat he devoted\r\nhimself to the study of astrology. He left Rome without the consent of\r\nAugustus, who was equally unwilling to allow of his return.\r\n\r\n[1245] Julia, one of the daughters of Julia and Agrippa, and the wife\r\nof L. Æmilius Paulus. She fully inherited the vices of her mother. For\r\nan adulterous intercourse with D. Silanus she was banished, by Augustus\r\nto Tremerus, off the coast of Apulia, where she survived twenty years,\r\ndependent on the bounty of the empress Livia. A child born after her\r\ndisgrace, was, by order of Augustus, exposed as spurious. She is\r\nsupposed by some to be the Corinna of Ovid’s amatory poems.\r\n\r\n[1246] He probably alludes to the rising of some tribes in the\r\nprovinces on the north-eastern coast of the Adriatic, in B.C. 35, who\r\nrefused to pay their tribute. They were finally vanquished by Statilius\r\nTaurus, B.C. 33.\r\n\r\n[1247] After the defeat of his general Varus, by Arminius, in Germany.\r\n\r\n[1248] This pestilence is also mentioned by Dion Cassius; it took place\r\nA.U.C. 732.—B.\r\n\r\n[1249] We have an account of the disastrous expedition of Varus in\r\nFlorus, B. iv. c. 12.—B.\r\n\r\n[1250] Suetonius speaks of calumnious pamphlets (libelli), that\r\nwere circulated about, even in the senate-house, to his extreme\r\ndisparagement.\r\n\r\n[1251] A posthumous son of M. Vipsanius Agrippa by Julia, the daughter\r\nof Augustus, by whom he was adopted together with Tiberius. He was\r\nafterwards banished to Planaria, off the coast of Corsica, on account\r\nof his savage and intractable character, though guilty of no crime.\r\nAugustus is said to have privately visited him there, which, coming to\r\nthe ears of Livia, increased her enmity against this youth, and he was\r\nmurdered by her orders or those of Tiberius.\r\n\r\n[1252] Tacitus, Ann. B. i. c. 3, says that he was banished by the\r\nartifices of Nero.—B.\r\n\r\n[1253] After his death his solemn apotheosis took place in the Campus\r\nMartius. In some of the coins which were struck even during his\r\nlife-time, he was called “Divus,” or “the god.”\r\n\r\n[1254] For Tiberius Nero, the father of Tiberius Cæsar, took the side\r\nof M. Antonius in the Civil War.—B.\r\n\r\n[1255] We have no mention of Pedius, or Phedius, as he is named in some\r\nof the MSS., in any of the ancient authors. A story of the same import\r\nis related of Solon and Tellus, by Herodotus, B. i. c. 30, and by\r\nPlutarch.—B.\r\n\r\n[1256] A town of Arcadia. See B. iv. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1257] This is also related by Valerius Maximus, B. vii. c. 1.—B.\r\n\r\n[1258] This is very similar to Virgil’s beautiful description of the\r\nold man Corycius, in the Georgics, B. iv. l. 125, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1259] We have some account of Euthymus in Pausanias, B. vi., and in\r\nÆlian, Var. Hist. B. viii. c. 18.—B.\r\n\r\n[1260] It has been conjectured by Poinsinet, that the word\r\n“Callimachus” does not refer to the well-known poet of that name, nor\r\nto any other individual, but that it was the title of the president\r\nof the Olympic games. The opinion is not without plausibility, but is\r\nscarcely sanctioned by sufficient authority.—B.\r\n\r\n[1261] Pliny here alludes to the doctrine of astrology, which forms the\r\nespecial subject of the next Chapter.—B.\r\n\r\n[1262] These statements are not found in any of the works of Hesiod now\r\nextant; it is scarcely necessary to observe, that they are entirely\r\nwithout foundation, and contrary to all observation and experience.—B.\r\n\r\n[1263] The great age of Arganthonius is referred to by Lucian, in his\r\ntreatise “De Macrobiis,” “on Long-lived Men;” by Herodotus, B. i. c.\r\n163; by Cicero, de Senect. sec. 19; and by Valerius Maximus, B. viii.\r\nc. 13; the three latter writers agree in making his age 120 years,\r\nand hence Pliny assigns to him the same age in the next page.—B. St.\r\nAugustine, De Civitate Dei, B. xv., quotes this passage of Pliny, and\r\nmentions the age of Arganthonius, as stated by him, to have been 152\r\nyears. For Tartessus, in Spain, see B. iii. c. 3, and B. iv. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[1264] His story is told by Ovid, Met. B. x., where he is said to have\r\nbecome unwittingly the father of Adonis, by his own daughter Myrrha (or\r\nSmyrna), in consequence of the anger of Venus or Aphrodite. He was said\r\nto have founded the city of Cinyra in Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[1265] Callimachus mentions a person of this name, who wrote a treatise\r\non the art of making cheesecakes. There was also a physician so called,\r\nwho flourished in the fifth century B.C., and who is said by Galen to\r\nhave been the first who wrote a treatise on the probe. Whether either\r\nof these individuals is the person here alluded to, is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1266] We have the same statement as to the age of Epimenides, in\r\nValerius Maximus, B. viii. s. 13; he also, in the same section, gives\r\nan account of the Epii, of Pictoreus, of Dandon, and of the king of the\r\nisland of the Tyrians, all of which agree with the present statement,\r\nexcept that the person mentioned by Damastes is called Literius, and\r\nthe last-named individual is styled the king of the island of the\r\nLutmii.—B.\r\n\r\n[1267] The king of the Tartessi, mentioned above.—B.\r\n\r\n[1268] Pliny has already spoken of the vigorous old age of Masinissa,\r\nin the 12th Chapter of the present Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1269] We have an account of Gorgias in Cicero, de Senect. sec. 9; in\r\nValerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 13, and in Lucian.—B.\r\n\r\n[1270] Valerius Maximus, _ubi supra_, reduces this to sixty-two\r\nyears.—B.\r\n\r\n[1271] We have the same statement respecting Perperna in Valerius\r\nMaximus, but he does not mention his age.—B.\r\n\r\n[1272] The names of the succeeding censors were C. Claudius Pulcher,\r\nand T. Sempronius Gracchus.\r\n\r\n[1273] V. Maximus gives the same account of the age of Corvinus,\r\nbut he states the interval between his consulships to have been\r\nforty-seven years. According to the Fasti, in Dr. Smith’s _Dictionary\r\nof Antiquities_, the interval was forty-eight years, from A.U.C. 406 to\r\nA.U.C. 455.—B.\r\n\r\n[1274] The honour of the curule-chair—“sella curulis.” It was attached\r\nto the offices of consul, prætor, and ædile; Corvinus had, therefore,\r\nbeen elected to one or other of these offices twenty-one times.—B.\r\n\r\n[1275] Valerius Maximus gives the same account of Metellus. He also\r\ninforms us that Metellus, although of an advanced age when created\r\npontiff, held the office for twenty-two years; so also Cicero, de\r\nSenect. sec. 9.—B.\r\n\r\n[1276] We have the same account of these females in Valerius Maximus.\r\nHe adds, that Clodia survived all her children; Seneca, Epist. 77, also\r\nrefers to the great age of Statilia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1277] “Emboliaria,” an actress in the “embolium,” or interlude of the\r\nRoman stage; also called “acroama,” by Cicero. It appears to have been\r\na concert of musical instruments, perhaps accompanied by dancing.\r\n\r\n[1278] Their consulship was A.U.C. 761.—B.\r\n\r\n[1279] Their consulship was A.U.C. 671, which would leave an interval\r\nof ninety years between her first appearance and her appearance at the\r\nvotive games.—B.\r\n\r\n[1280] “Togatus saltare instituit.” He acted in the “togatæ fabulæ,”\r\ncomedies representing Roman life, or the life of those who wore the\r\ntoga, the civic costume of the Romans. The Greek comedies were called\r\n“palliatæ.”\r\n\r\n[1281] The secular games of Augustus are stated by Suetonius, in his\r\nLife of Augustus, c. 31, and by Dion Cassius, to have taken place\r\nA.U.C. 739.—B.\r\n\r\n[1282] “We have an account of Epigenes, by Hardouin, Lemaire, vol. i.\r\npp. 86, 87, where he is designated Rhodius. He is referred to by Varro,\r\nColumella, and Seneca; Pliny mentions him in other parts of his work.—B.\r\n\r\n[1283] Berosus has been referred to in the 37th Chapter of the present\r\nBook.—B.\r\n\r\n[1284] For some account of Petosiris and Necepsos, see end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1285] Literally, the fourth part; according to Hardouin’s explanation,\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 186.—B.\r\n\r\n[1286] Literally ... “repetitions.” Dalechamps explains it as\r\nindicating, “that part of the heavens which is distant thirty parts;\r\nthat is to say, two signs from the horoscope;” Lemaire, vol. iii. p.\r\n187.—B.\r\n\r\n[1287] Ajasson refers us to Jul. Firmicus for an explanation of the\r\ndifference which may exist in the length of the lives of individuals\r\nas depending on their natal day; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 186. It\r\nappears to have been one of the leading tenets of the astrologers,\r\nthat the favourable influence of the ascending sign is diminished or\r\ncounteracted by the rays of other planets, or of the sun, falling upon\r\nthe sign in certain directions or at certain angles, and that the\r\nlength of the life of the individual is shortened in proportion to this\r\ninjurious effect.—B.\r\n\r\n[1288] This term means, literally, “increasing by a regular scale,” or,\r\n“according to a proportional series of numbers;” the multiples of 7\r\nhave been generally supposed to be the critical periods of human life,\r\nand, more especially, 63, or 9 times 7, which was accordingly termed\r\n“the grand climacteric.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1289] This census appears to have taken place A.D. 74, under the\r\nfifth consulship of Vespasian, and the third of Titus; according to\r\nCensorinus, it was the last of which we have any distinct account.—B.\r\n\r\n[1290] “Vasaria;” it is said, by the commentators, to be a term of\r\nGerman origin, derived from a word which signified the bark of a tree.\r\nIt does not appear, however, from what cause it was appropriated to\r\nthe sense in which it is used by Pliny. The word is found in Cicero’s\r\noration against Piso, sec. 35; but is there applied to a totally\r\ndifferent object.—B.\r\n\r\n[1291] Now Brigella or Brescella. Parma still retains its ancient name,\r\nPlacentia is now Piacenza, and Faventia the modern Faenza.\r\n\r\n[1292] Probably the same as the Velia, mentioned by Phlegon Trallianus\r\nas famous for the longevity of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[1293] “Marcus Mucius, M. Filius, Galeria, Felix.” It has been doubted\r\nby the commentators, whether the word Galeria refers to the name of\r\nthe mother of Mucius, or to the tribe to which he belonged. The latter\r\nis, perhaps, the more natural interpretation. Hardouin and Ajasson,\r\nhowever, adopt the opinion, that Galeria was the mother of Marcus;\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. pp. 191, 192. We meet with a precisely similar\r\nconstruction of words in Cicero, 9th Philip. sec. 7; “Ser. Sulpicius,\r\nQ. Filius, Lemonia Rufus.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1294] The son of Panthöus, and friend of Hector. He was famous for his\r\nwisdom and prudence in giving counsel. See Iliad, B. xviii. l. 249-52.\r\n\r\n[1295] The passage referred to is in the Iliad, B. xviii. l. 249-51.—B.\r\n\r\n[1296] Respecting Cælius [formerly called Cæcilius in most editions]\r\nHardouin informs us that he was the accuser of Calpurnius, that he was\r\nprætor during the consulship of P. Lentulus Spinther and L. Metellus\r\nNepos, and was oppressed by Clodius. Pliny refers to Cælius, and his\r\naccusation of Calpurnius, in a subsequent passage, B. xxvii. c. 2.—B.\r\nLicinius Calvus Macer was by some considered, as an orator, to rival\r\neven Cicero himself; and as a poet, is generally mentioned by the side\r\nof Catullus. He exhausted his constitution by his severe application,\r\nand died in his thirty-fifth or thirty-sixth year. He was remarkable\r\nfor the extreme shortness of his stature. Cælius was a partisan of\r\nPompey, and was eventually put to death at Thurii.\r\n\r\n[1297] Consul A.U.C. 463; he is generally called Rufinus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1298] This anecdote is mentioned by Cicero, De Nat. Deor. B. iii. c.\r\n28, and by Valerius Maximus, B. i. c. 8.—B. He was tyrant of Pheræ and\r\nTagus in Thessaly, and was finally assassinated.\r\n\r\n[1299] He was consul A.U.C. 633; in consequence of the victories\r\nwhich he obtained over the Allobroges, he obtained the agnomen of\r\n“Allobrogicus.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1300] Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 13, refers to the great age of\r\nXenophilus, but designates him “Pythagoræus;” he says that he obtained\r\nhis information respecting him from Aristoxenus, the musician,\r\nwhich may have led to an inaccuracy on the part of Pliny. Poinsinet\r\nendeavours to reconcile the discrepancy, by the circumstance, that\r\nmusic formed a prominent part of the Pythagorean discipline.—B.\r\n\r\n[1301] “Per sapientiam mori.” Many conjectures have been formed\r\nrespecting the meaning of this passage, which is obscure. Attempts have\r\nbeen made to amend the reading of the text, but, as it appears, without\r\nsuccess; see the notes of Hardouin, Ajasson, and others, Lemaire, vol.\r\niii. pp. 197, 8.—B. It is pretty clear, however, that Pliny here refers\r\nto what, in the next Chapter, he calls “sapientiæ ægritudo,” the malady\r\nby the Greeks called “phrenesis,” and by us “frenzy,” which attacks the\r\nseat of wisdom, the understanding. Many pages have been written upon\r\nthe meaning of this passage, obvious as it seems to be.\r\n\r\n[1302] The same doctrine is advanced in B. xxviii., which treats of\r\nmedicine, see c. 10.—B.\r\n\r\n[1303] Among the ancients, all the manufactures and mechanical arts\r\nwere carried on by slaves; they were, consequently, subjected to the\r\nsame kinds of morbid causes which are found, in modern times, to be so\r\ndetrimental to certain descriptions of workmen.—B.\r\n\r\n[1304] Our own experience has taught us the truth of this observation\r\nin the case of the cholera; and the great plague of 1348, which is\r\nthought to have swept off one-third of mankind, is supposed to have\r\ntravelled to Europe from the vicinity of the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[1305] Dalechamps correctly remarks, that the laughter here referred\r\nto, is not the indication of mirth, but what has been termed the “risus\r\nSardonicus,” the “Sardonic laugh,” produced by a convulsive action of\r\nthe muscles of the face; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 201.—B.\r\n\r\n[1306] “Sapientiæ ægritudine.” See Note [1301] above.\r\n\r\n[1307] Pliny probably took this notion from Celsus, who speaks of this\r\nas being a fatal symptom, B. ii. c. 6; “si manibus qui in febre, &c.,\r\nin veste floccos legit, fimbriasque diducit....”—B.\r\n\r\n[1308] “Venarum percussa;” the ancients were not acquainted with the\r\nrelation which exists between the arteries and the veins, or the\r\nappropriate functions of these parts.—B.\r\n\r\n[1309] In Seneca, Contr. B. ii., we find the remark, “Such genius, at\r\nso early an age, bodes no long life.” Apuleius, quoting from some Greek\r\nwriter, says, “Odi puerulos præcoci sapientiâ.” “I hate your bits of\r\nboys, with their precocious wisdom.” We have a somewhat similar saying\r\nto the above passage from Seneca, “He is too wise,” or “too clever to\r\nlive long.”\r\n\r\n[1310] This remark has been confirmed by various writers, ancient and\r\nmodern; it appears to depend upon an unnatural development of the\r\ncerebral and nervous system, which renders it more liable to disease,\r\nand less able to bear the impressions to which it is ordinarily\r\nexposed.—B.\r\n\r\n[1311] This was probably Phthiriasis, or the “morbus pediculosus,”\r\nwhich has been previously mentioned in this book with reference to\r\nSulla, and of which, probably, Herod Agrippa died. Some authors state\r\nthat Pherecydes put an end to his life by throwing himself from a rock\r\nat Delphi; others give other accounts of his death.\r\n\r\n[1312] This circumstance is mentioned by Seneca, De Provid. c. 3.—B.\r\n\r\n[1313] We have the same account of Antipater in Valerius Maximus, B. i.\r\nc. 8. He was the preceptor of Cato of Utica; Cicero makes honourable\r\nmention of him, De Oratore, B. iii. c. 50.—B.\r\n\r\n[1314] We have an account of the death of Aviola, in Valerius Maximus,\r\nB. i. c. 8. This name occurs in the Consular Fasti, A.U.C. 806; but it\r\ncould not be that of the person referred to by Valerius Maximus, as his\r\nwork was published under the reign of Tiberius, who died A.U.C. 789.\r\nWe have also an account of the death of Lamia in Valerius Maximus, as\r\noccurring under the same circumstances with that of Aviola.—B.\r\n\r\n[1315] Poinsinet, vol. iii. pp. 251, 252, supposes, that Messala and\r\nRufus are the names of two writers, and not, as usually supposed, of\r\none only. The conjecture appears not improbable.—B.\r\n\r\n[1316] Plutarch, “De Deo Socratis,” gives us the same account of\r\nHermotinus. Ajasson has remarked, not inaptly, that this story is very\r\nsimilar to the modern statements as to the effect of animal magnetism,\r\nLemaire, iii. 207.—B. Apuleius, in his “Defence,” has a passage which\r\nis remarkable as clearly bearing reference to the doctrines inculcated\r\nby the mesmerists of modern times; be says, “Quin et illud mecum\r\nreputo, posse animum humanum, præsertim puerilem et simplicem seu\r\ncarminum avocamento, sine odorum delenimento, soporari et ad oblivionem\r\npræsentium externari; et paulisper remotâ corporis memoriâ, redigi et\r\nredire ad naturam suam quæ est immortalis scilicet et divina; atque ita\r\nveluti quodam sopore futura rerum præsagire.”\r\n\r\n[1317] We have no notice of any people, under this appellation, in\r\nGreece; Cantharus, however, occurs as the name of an individual, and\r\npossibly these may have been his descendants, or the members of his\r\nfamily.—B.\r\n\r\n[1318] See B. v. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[1319] We have an account of Aristeas in Herodotus, iv. 13, but\r\nsomewhat different from that here given; Aristeas is also mentioned by\r\nApollonius in his Hist. Mirab., and A. Gellius, B. ix. c. 4.—B. He was\r\nan epic poet, who flourished in the time of Crœsus and Cyrus. Herodotus\r\nmentions a story that he reappeared at Metapontum, in Italy, 340 years\r\nafter his death. He is generally represented as a magician, whose soul\r\ncould leave, and re-enter his body at pleasure.\r\n\r\n[1320] A poet and prophet of Crete. The story was, that being sent\r\nby his father to fetch a sheep, he went into a cave, and fell into a\r\nsleep, from which he did not awake for fifty-seven years. On awaking,\r\nhe sought for the sheep, and was astonished on finding everything\r\naltered. On returning home, he found that his young brother had in the\r\nmeantime become an aged man. His story is only equalled by the famous\r\none of the Seven Sleepers of Damascus, who fell asleep in the time of\r\nthe Decian persecution of the Christians, and slept in a cave till the\r\nthirtieth year of the reign of the Emperor Theodosius, 196 years. It is\r\nnot improbable that it is to this story about Epimenides, that we are\r\nindebted for the amusing story of Rip Van Winkle, by Washington Irving.\r\n\r\n[1321] We have the life of Epimenides by Diogenes Laertius, who gives\r\nan account of this long-continued sleep. It is also mentioned by other\r\nwriters, but there is some difference in their statements as to its\r\nlength.—B.\r\n\r\n[1322] According to the interpretation of Dalechamps, “spiritus et\r\nanimæ interceptioni ac privationi,” “the interception and privation of\r\nthe breath and faculties;” Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 208.—B.\r\n\r\n[1323] He probably alludes to what are known among us as hysteria, or\r\nhysterical affections.\r\n\r\n[1324] We have an account of Heraclides in Diogenes Laertius; he was a\r\nnative of Pontus, and a pupil of Aristotle.—B.\r\n\r\n[1325] This circumstance is not mentioned in either of the two works\r\nof Varro which have come down to us, “De Re Rusticâ,” and “De Linguâ\r\nLatinâ.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1326] They were a body of commissioners appointed for the distribution\r\nof lands in Campania; Julius Cæsar, when consul, having caused a law to\r\nbe passed, dividing that territory among such of the Roman citizens as\r\nshould have three or more children.\r\n\r\n[1327] We are not informed, whether these persons of the name of\r\nCorfidius, were in any way connected, nor, indeed, do we appear to have\r\nany certain knowledge of their history.—B. L. Corfidius, a Roman eques,\r\nis mentioned by Cicero, in his oration for Ligarius, B.C. 46, as one of\r\nthe distinguished men who were then interceding with Cæsar on behalf of\r\nLigarius; but after the oration was published, Cicero was informed that\r\nhe had made a mistake in mentioning the name of Corfidius, as he had\r\ndied before the speech was delivered. It does not appear certain that\r\nhe was one of the parties here mentioned: but it is not improbable that\r\nhe was the brother whose sudden death is mentioned below.\r\n\r\n[1328] Among the ancients, servants used to be summoned by clapping the\r\nhands, as they are, in modern times, by ringing of bells.—B. The same\r\npractice still prevails in the east.\r\n\r\n[1329] In the twenty-third Chapter of the present Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1330] Val. Maximus, B. ix. c. 12, and Diodorus Siculus, B. xiii. c.\r\n14, gives the same account. It has been said, that, when he heard\r\nthe news, he called for a draught of wine, and was choked with\r\na grape-stone; this incident forms the subject of an epigram by\r\nSimonides, quoted by Hardouin, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 210.—B.\r\n\r\n[1331] There is reason to believe, that the prize was given rather to\r\nthe rank, than to the poetry of Dionysius; see the remarks of Ajasson,\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. pp. 210, 211.—B.\r\n\r\n[1332] This anecdote is related by Livy, B. xxii. c. 7; by Valerius\r\nMaximus, B. ix. c. 12; and by Aulus Gellius, B. iii. c. 15; the\r\ntwo former, however, state, that it occurred after the battle of\r\nThrasymenus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1333] Cicero, De Fato, sec. 6, styles Diodorus, “valens\r\ndialecticus.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1334] According to Hardouin, these were Lucius, the prætor, and Caius,\r\nthe father of the dictator; they were brothers, and the sons of C.\r\nCæsar.—B.\r\n\r\n[1335] Thirty-first of December; consequently his tenure of office\r\nwas for a few hours only. Cicero indulged in several jokes upon his\r\nconsulship, remarking that no one had died during it; and that the\r\nconsul was extremely vigilant, for that he had never slept during his\r\nterm of office.\r\n\r\n[1336] This took place A.U.C. 708; Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, gives\r\nus an account of the jests passed by Cicero and others on the brief\r\nduration of his office.—B.\r\n\r\n[1337] He is supposed to have been the same person who was consul\r\nA.U.C. 732.—B.\r\n\r\n[1338] The Comitium was a place in the forum at Rome, where the\r\n“comitia curiata” were held, and certain offences tried and punished.\r\nIt was here also that the tribunal, or “suggestum,” was situate.\r\n\r\n[1339] We are informed by Hardouin, that he held the office of Prætor\r\nA.U.C. 660.—B.\r\n\r\n[1340] “A puero;” not necessarily a slave, as Littrè seems to think.\r\n\r\n[1341] On Hardouin’s authority, we learn that A. Pompeius was surnamed\r\nBithynicus, and was prætor A.U.C. 680.—B.\r\n\r\n[1342] The death of Thalna is given somewhat more in detail by Valerius\r\nMaximus, B. ix. c. 12; it took place A.U.C. 590.—B.\r\n\r\n[1343] The ancients reckoned the hours from sun-rise; in summer, the\r\nsecond hour of the day would be six o’clock A.M., and in the winter, a\r\nquarter past eight.—B.\r\n\r\n[1344] Bankers, and usurers more especially, had their shops in the\r\nRoman Forum.\r\n\r\n[1345] “Cum vadimonium differri jubet.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1346] Augustus built a third Forum, because the old one and that of\r\nJulius Cæsar, were not found sufficient for the great increase of\r\nbusiness. He adorned it with a temple of Mars, and the statues of the\r\nmost distinguished Romans.\r\n\r\n[1347] According to Hardouin, this ivory statue was in the eighth\r\nregion of the city.—B.\r\n\r\n[1348] “Specillum;” this instrument is mentioned by Celsus, B. vi.\r\nc. 6, 25, _et alibi_. There has been a considerable discussion among\r\nthe commentators respecting the “specillum;” see Lemaire, vol. iii.\r\npp. 213, 214. From the uses to which it was applied by Celsus, we can\r\nhave little doubt upon the subject. Poinsinet and Ajasson employ the\r\nequivalent French term “eprouvette.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1349] “Mulsum” was the most universally esteemed of all the beverages\r\nused among the Romans. It seems to have been of two kinds: in the one\r\ncase honey was mixed with wine, in the other with must. Massic or\r\nFalernian wine was preferred for the purpose, and new Attic honey. The\r\nproportions were four measures of wine to one of honey; and various\r\nperfumes and spices were added. See B. xxii, c. 4. It was especially\r\nvalued as the most appropriate draught on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\n[1350] The Cornelius Gallus here mentioned could not have been the poet\r\nof the same name, because, as we are informed, he died by his own hand.\r\nThe death of the poet Gallus is alluded to by Ovid, Amores, B. iii. El.\r\n9, l. 64.—B. A similar fate is said, by Tertullian, to have overtaken\r\nSpeusippus, the Platonic philosopher. The same was also said by some of\r\nthe poet Pindar.\r\n\r\n[1351] Val. Maximus, B. ix. c. 12, gives the same account of the death\r\nof Gallus and Haterius.—B.\r\n\r\n[1352] Which was usually worn by the Romans at their entertainments.\r\n\r\n[1353] Considering _some_ of the above cases, Pliny must have had a\r\ncurious notion of a happy death. Ovid would have agreed with him in one\r\nrespect; for in his amatory poems, he expresses a wish that he may die\r\nof a surfeit of sensual enjoyment.\r\n\r\n[1354] The great-grandfather of the Emperor Nero. We have a reference\r\nto his death by Seneca, De Benef. B. iii. c. 24, and a more full\r\naccount of it by Suetonius, Life of Nero, c. 2.—B.\r\n\r\n[1355] The charioteers at Rome were divided into four companies, or\r\n“factiones,” each distinguished by a colour, representing the season\r\nof the year. These colours were green for the spring, red for the\r\nsummer, azure for autumn, and white for the winter. Domitian afterwards\r\nincreased them to six, adding the golden and the purple. The most\r\nardent party spirit prevailed among them, and the interest in their\r\nsuccess extended to all classes and both sexes.\r\n\r\n[1356] In the thirty-sixth Chapter of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1357] It would appear, from Dalechamps and Hardouin, that this\r\nstatement, respecting the period when the custom of burning the body\r\nafter death was first adopted by the Romans, is incorrect, Lemaire,\r\nvol. iii. p. 219. There is much uncertainty as to its origin, and the\r\nsource from which they borrowed it. We learn from Macrobius, that the\r\npractice was discontinued in his time, _i. e._ in the fourth century\r\nafter Christ.—B.\r\n\r\n[1358] We have the same remarks, respecting the antiquity of the custom\r\nof interring the body, the continued adoption of it by the Cornelian\r\nfamily, and the supposed notion of Sylla, in ordering his own body to\r\nbe burnt, in Cicero, De Leg. B. ii. c. 22, from whom it is probable\r\nPliny may have borrowed them.—B.\r\n\r\n[1359] We have no English term that will preserve the distinction\r\nwhich Pliny makes between the two modes of disposing of the body after\r\ndeath.—B.\r\n\r\n[1360] He views the state after death in the same light as Democritus\r\nand Epicurus, utterly denying the immortality of the soul; though\r\nit cannot be said that he looks upon life in the same cheerful,\r\nlaissez-faire manner in which it was regarded by the latter of these\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\n[1361] Hardouin remarks, that the ancients made a distinction between\r\nthe souls of the dead, and their spirits or shades, “umbræ.” The former\r\nwere supposed to remain on the earth, while the latter were removed\r\neither to Elysium or to Tartarus, according to the character or actions\r\nof the deceased.—B.\r\n\r\n[1362] According to Varro, Democritus directs, that the body shall not\r\nbe burnt after death, but preserved in honey; on which Varro remarks,\r\nhow greatly such a practice would tend to raise the price of that\r\narticle.—B.\r\n\r\n[1363] It has been conjectured, that Bacchus derived his name from the\r\nGreek word Βάσκω, on account of his numerous journies into different\r\nparts of the world; it was during these that he conveyed to the various\r\nnations which he visited the arts of civilized life.—B.\r\n\r\n[1364] We have a long discussion by Poinsinet, vol. iii. pp. 234, 235,\r\non the derivation of the name of Ceres, in which he endeavours to\r\nexplain the various attributes that were ascribed to her. The character\r\nin which she was generally regarded by the writers of antiquity, was\r\nthe one here given to her by Pliny; in proof of which we may refer,\r\namong other authorities, to Virgil, Geor. B. i. l. 147. and to Ovid,\r\nMetam. B. iii. l. 341.—B.\r\n\r\n[1365] The earliest method of reducing corn to the state proper for the\r\nfood of man, was by pounding it in a mortar; afterwards, when it was\r\nground between stones, they were moved by the hand, as is still the\r\npractice in many parts of the East. It was not until a comparatively\r\nlate period that water was employed as the moving power for mills.—B.\r\n\r\n[1366] It has been supposed by some commentators, that the character\r\nof legislator was bestowed upon Ceres, in consequence of the name by\r\nwhich she was designated, in the ancient northern languages, being\r\nincorrectly transferred to the Greek. Others have thought that it might\r\nbe referred to the connection which may be supposed to exist between an\r\nadvance in the arts of life generally and an improvement of the laws.—B.\r\n\r\n[1367] We do not find the circumstance here referred to in the “Noctes\r\nAtticæ” of Aulus Gellius.—B.\r\n\r\n[1368] It would appear that there were two individuals of this name,\r\nwho were confounded with each other; Simonides, the celebrated poet,\r\nlived as late as the fifth century before Christ, so that it has been\r\nthought improbable that the Greek language could have existed without\r\nthe four letters here mentioned, until so recent a period.—B.\r\n\r\n[1369] The account of the original introduction of the alphabet into\r\nGreece, here given, is the one generally adopted in his time. Most\r\nreaders will be aware, that the actual invention of letters, the share\r\nwhich the Egyptians and the Phœnicians had in it, the identification\r\nof Cadmus, and still more of Mercury, with any of the heroes or\r\nlegislators of antiquity, of whom we have any correct historical data,\r\nand the connection which the Greek alphabet had with those of other\r\nnations, are among the most curious questions of literary discussion,\r\nand are still far from being resolved with any degree of certainty.—B.\r\n\r\n[1370] It seems to have been the general opinion, that the Greek\r\nlanguage had, originally, sixteen or eighteen letters, the source\r\nof which was very uncertain, and of high antiquity; and to these,\r\nadditional letters were, from time to time, appended by different\r\nindividuals. Upon the whole, the claim of the Egyptians to the\r\ninvention of letters, seems to rest upon, at least, a very plausible\r\nfoundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1371] Epicharmus was born in the fifth century B.C., in the island of\r\nCos, but removed, probably at an early age, to Sicily, where he passed\r\na considerable portion of his life. His original profession was that of\r\na physician, but he appears to have devoted his attention principally\r\nto general science and literature, and is more especially remarkable\r\nas the inventor of regular comedy. A few fragments only of his dramas\r\nremain, but the titles of no less than forty are preserved. From a line\r\nin the Prologue to the Menæchmi of Plautus, where it is said that the\r\nplot of the play, “non Atticissat verum Sicilicissat” “is not Attic,\r\nbut Sicilian;” it has been conjectured, that Plautus took the plot of\r\nthe piece from Epicharmus.\r\n\r\n[1372] Phoroneus was the son of Inachus, and the second king of Argos;\r\nhe began to reign about 1807 B.C.—B.\r\n\r\n[1373] Epigenes has already been referred to in the fifty-fourth\r\nchapter of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1374] There has been much discussion respecting the interpretation of\r\nthis passage. In the first place, the numbers in the text have extended\r\nfrom 720 and 490 to as many thousands, by the addition of the letter\r\nM., against the authority, however, of some MSS. In the next place,\r\nin order to curtail the enormous periods thus formed, the years have\r\nbeen supposed to be only lunar, or even diurnal periods. The opinion\r\nof Hardouin and Marcus is perhaps the better founded, who reject the\r\nproposed alteration, and consider these numbers to indicate, according\r\nto their natural signification, periods of years. The principal\r\nconsideration that has been urged in favour of the alteration of the\r\ntext is derived from two passages in Cicero’s Treatise de Divin. B. i.\r\nc. 19, and B. ii. c. 46, where he refers to the very long periods which\r\nthe Babylonians employed in their calculations, but which he justly\r\nregards as entirely without foundation, and even ridiculous. Pliny,\r\nhowever, professes to follow the opinion of Epigenes whom he styles\r\n“gravis auctor,” and who, we may premise, would reject these improbable\r\ntales.—B. The reading, 720 _thousands_, is the one adopted by Sillig.\r\n\r\n[1375] Pausanias, in his “Attica,” calls the two brothers Agrolas and\r\nHyperbius. Some commentators have supposed, that these names, as well\r\nas Doxius and Cælus, mentioned below, are merely symbolical, and that\r\nthe personages are fictitious.—B.\r\n\r\n[1376] The Gellius here mentioned had the prænomen of Cneius; he is\r\nnot to be confounded with the more noted Aulus Gellius, by whom he is\r\nquoted in the Noct. Att. B. xiii. c. 29.—B.\r\n\r\n[1377] There is a number of ancient legends attached to the name of\r\nCecrops, yet we have but little authentic information respecting\r\nhim. What appears to be the best established is, that he was born in\r\nthe city of Sais, in Egypt, and that, about 1556 B.C., he conducted\r\na colony to Attica, where he built a fortress, on the Acropolis of\r\nAthens, and that his descendants continued, for some generations, to be\r\nkings of Attica.—B.\r\n\r\n[1378] If this is the Cinyra previously mentioned in c. 49, he is more\r\ngenerally represented as the son of Apollo, or of Paphos, a priest of\r\nthe Paphian Aphrodite or Venus. The true reading, however, is uncertain.\r\n\r\n[1379] Hardouin informs us, that in all the MSS. which he has\r\nconsulted, this person is named Agricola, while in the printed editions\r\nof Pliny he is styled Agriopa, or Agriopas. Poinsinet, vol. iii. pp.\r\n250, 251, endeavours to explain this, by supposing, that the word\r\n“Agricola” was the one employed by Pliny, but was used by him as a\r\ngeneric, not as an appellative term. Some of the earlier editors,\r\nhowever, conceiving that no agricultural operations could be carried\r\non, before the invention of the necessary implements, had changed the\r\nname into Agriopa, derived from two Greek words, signifying “a man in\r\nthe savage state, who is only capable of uttering inarticulate sounds.”\r\nThis method of solving the difficulty will probably appear fanciful and\r\ntoo refined, but it is the only one which has been proposed.—B.\r\n\r\n[1380] The copper-mines of Temesa, supposed to have been in Cyprus, are\r\nmentioned by Homer. There was another place of that name in Bruttium,\r\nand another in India, both equally famous for their copper.\r\n\r\n[1381] Danaus is said to have migrated from Egypt into Greece about\r\n1485 B.C. He may have introduced wells into Greece, but they had, long\r\nbefore his time, been employed in Egypt and in other countries. The\r\nterm “Dipsion,” “thirsting,” which it appears had been applied to the\r\ndistrict of Argos, may seem to render it probable, that, before the\r\narrival of Danaus, the inhabitants had not adopted any artificial means\r\nof supplying themselves with water.—B. But this country, we are told,\r\nis naturally well supplied with water.\r\n\r\n[1382] Nothing is known respecting this individual; it does not appear\r\nthat he is mentioned by any other of the ancients.—B.\r\n\r\n[1383] There is so much fable mixed up with the account of the\r\nCyclopes, that it is difficult to ascertain their real history. It\r\nseems probable, that there was a people of high antiquity, who were\r\nparticularly skilful in the erection of stone edifices of various\r\nkinds, and more especially of those which served for the defence of\r\ncities. The remains of walls and other structures, which have obtained\r\nthe name of Cyclopian, are found in various parts of Greece, Italy,\r\nand Sicily, and may be regarded as among the oldest works of man in\r\nexistence, although they are probably of less antiquity than those of\r\nEgypt and of some parts of Asia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1384] We have sufficient evidence of the early period at which the\r\nart of weaving was practised in Egypt, from the figures to be found on\r\ntheir monuments, and from the specimens of their manufactures, some of\r\nvery delicate texture, which have been found in the most ancient of\r\ntheir tombs. It was doubted, at one time, whether these fine stuffs\r\nwere formed from the fibres of flax or of cotton, or, in other words,\r\nwhether they were cambric or muslin; but it is now generally admitted\r\nthat they are made of flax. We have frequent mention of the products\r\nof the loom in the Pentateuch; we may select the 13th chapter of\r\nLeviticus, where linen and woollen stuffs are especially mentioned, and\r\ndistinguished from each other.—B.\r\n\r\n[1385] It is very difficult, probably impossible, in the present day,\r\nto determine to which of the nations of antiquity we are indebted for\r\nthe invention of the art of dyeing. We have notices of coloured stuffs\r\nin various parts of the Pentateuch, and there is reason to suppose,\r\nthat the art was practised, at a very early period, by the Egyptians,\r\nthe Phœnicians, and the Indians. They had even arrived at the knowledge\r\nof partial dyeing, or what is technically termed “printing,” as applied\r\nto cotton or linen.—B.\r\n\r\n[1386] According to Justin, B. ii. c. 6, the Athenians introduced the\r\nuse of wool among their countrymen; but it has been supposed that they\r\nlearned it from the Egyptians.—B.\r\n\r\n[1387] Arachne is said to have been a native of Hypæpæ, near Colophon,\r\nin Asia Minor, and has been celebrated for her skill in embroidery\r\nby Ovid, Metam. B. vi. As we have sufficient evidence that linen was\r\nmanufactured by the Egyptians at a very early period, we may presume\r\nthat this account of Arachne is either fabulous, or that, in some\r\nway or other, she was instrumental in the introduction of linen into\r\nGreece.—B.\r\n\r\n[1388] Nothing is known of this individual, nor have we any further\r\ninformation respecting the discovery ascribed to him.—B.\r\n\r\n[1389] Homer, Il. B. vii. l. 221, and Ovid, Fasti, B. iii. l. 824,\r\nspeak of Tychius, as particularly skilful in making shoes, and other\r\narticles of leather.—B.\r\n\r\n[1390] It is difficult to determine, how far we are to regard the names\r\nhere mentioned as belonging to real or only to fictitious personages,\r\nnor is it easy for us to ascertain what should be regarded as the\r\nactual invention of medicine. A certain kind of medical, or rather\r\nsurgical practice, must have existed in the rudest state of society and\r\nin the earliest ages, which was improved and refined by the gradual\r\nexperience and increased civilization of each successive generation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1391] In this, as in so many others of the arts, the original\r\ninvention has been given to the Egyptians, while the introduction of it\r\ninto Greece is ascribed to Cadmus. The word _æs_, which is generally\r\ntranslated “brass,” as well as the Greek word χαλκὸς, was applied by\r\nthe ancients, either to copper, or what is properly bronze, _i. e._\r\na mixture of copper and tin. Brass, the compound of copper and zinc,\r\ndoes not appear to have been known to them. With respect to the claim\r\nof the Scythians to the discovery of the use of copper, it has been\r\njustly remarked, that it is natural to suppose it to have been first\r\nknown in those countries, where the ore of the metal is found in large\r\nquantities, which is the case in the region that was anciently named\r\nScythia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1392] According to Pausanias, the art of forging iron was discovered\r\nby Glaucus of Chios. Strabo ascribes it to the Idæan Dactyli, and the\r\nart of manufacturing utensils of bronze and iron to the Telchines; the\r\nformer were inhabitants of Crete, the latter of Rhodes.—B.\r\n\r\n[1393] According to Hyginus, silver was first discovered in Scythia by\r\nIndus, and introduced into Attica by Erichthonius. Æacus is said by\r\nCassiodorus to have been the discoverer of gold.—B.\r\n\r\n[1394] Pangæus is generally described as a mountain on the confines\r\nof Macedonia and Thrace; but Marcus says that it was a mountain of\r\nAbyssinia, near the source of the Nile, and he adduces various passages\r\nfrom the ancients to prove that the Egyptians had an extensive traffic\r\nthere in gold at a very early period; Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 191, 192.—B.\r\n\r\n[1395] Thoas was the king of the Tauric Chersonnesus, and Panchaia was\r\na district of Arabia Felix; it does not appear what connection Thoas\r\ncould have with Panchaia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1396] We have no account of any individual bearing this name, and it\r\nhas been proposed by Hardouin to substitute for it “Midas Phrygius,”\r\nwho is said, both by Hyginus and by Cassiodorus, to have been the\r\ndiscoverer of lead.—B.\r\n\r\n[1397] From the accounts of Pliny, B. iv. c. 36, as well as of Strabo,\r\nand the other ancient geographers, it appears, that he here alludes\r\nto the Scilly Isles, including, probably, the western extremity of\r\nCornwall. We are informed by Herodotus, B. iii. c. 115, that tin was\r\nbrought from them, and they were hence named the “tin islands,” from\r\nthe Greek word for tin, κασσίτερος.—B.\r\n\r\n[1398] On this subject we may refer to Note 72.—B.\r\n\r\n[1399] Pliny, in B. xxxv. c. 45, informs us, that Choræbus invented the\r\nart of making pottery, and that it was first exercised, as a trade, by\r\nChalcosthenes. He says, that a certain district of Athens obtained the\r\nname of “Ceramicos,” from his manufactory of earthen-ware, derived from\r\nκέραμος, “potter’s clay.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1400] The inventions here ascribed to Dædalus, are, by many of the\r\nancients, given to his nephew; see Isidorus, Hyginus, Diodorus Siculus,\r\nand Ovid, Metam. B. viii. l. 234, _et seq._—B.\r\n\r\n[1401] “Ichthyocolla,” perhaps more properly, “Fish-glue.”\r\n\r\n[1402] Pausanias ascribes also to Theodorus the invention of forging\r\niron and copper. According to Vitruvius, the square was invented by\r\nPythagoras.—B.\r\n\r\n[1403] The same statement is made by Strabo, and other writers of\r\nantiquity, and is confirmed by the Arundelian Marbles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1404] See B. xiii. c. 42.\r\n\r\n[1405] Marcus informs us, that, according to the Arundelian Marbles,\r\nErichthonius, the fourth king of Athens, was the inventor of\r\nchariots.—B. See p. 229.\r\n\r\n[1406] Hardouin remarks, that Pliny, in the beginning of this Chapter,\r\nascribes the invention of commerce to Bacchus; we may suppose, that the\r\ncommerce there referred to, was the conveyance of goods by land, while\r\nthat of the Carthaginians was traffic by sea.—B.\r\n\r\n[1407] Eumolpus was a native of Thrace; but being expelled from his\r\nnative country, he invaded Attica, and, after various contests with\r\nErichthonius, obtained the office of high-priest of Ceres, which was\r\ncontinued to his descendants.—B.\r\n\r\n[1408] We learn from the writings of Moses, that the planting of the\r\nvine, and the conversion of the juice of the grape into wine, was\r\npractised by Noah immediately after the Flood. The mixing of water with\r\nwine would seem to be a very obvious and natural mode of procuring a\r\npleasant and refreshing beverage.—B.\r\n\r\n[1409] From the writings of Moses, we learn that the use of oil and of\r\nhoney was known to the inhabitants of Palestine and Egypt, at a very\r\nearly period.—B.\r\n\r\n[1410] “Buzyges” is a Greek term, signifying “one who yokes oxen;”\r\naccording to Hardouin, the real name of the person here referred to was\r\nEpimenides.—B.\r\n\r\n[1411] For an account of Triptolemus, the reader may consult Hyginus,\r\nand Pausanias, B. vii. Achaica.—B. Also the Fasti of Ovid, B. iv. l.\r\n507, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1412] Phalaris is supposed to have been contemporary with Servius\r\nTullius, who reigned from 577 to 533 B.C.—B.\r\n\r\n[1413] Meaning a citizen who obtained the sovereignty by violence and\r\nusurpation.\r\n\r\n[1414] This is supposed to have taken place 1000 years before Christ,\r\nwhen the Lacedæmonians conquered the Helots. But Moses had given the\r\nJews a code of laws, respecting the treatment of slaves, between 400\r\nand 500 years before that event, and we have various intimations of\r\nthe existence of slavery, in his writings, long before his time. It\r\nappears, indeed, that in the different countries of the East, and in\r\nAfrica, slavery has existed from time immemorial.—B.\r\n\r\n[1415] This is confirmed by Ælian, Var. Hist. B. iii. c. 38.—B.\r\n\r\n[1416] According to the same fabulous account of the early Grecian\r\nhistory, they were twin brothers, kings of the Argives; after much\r\ncontention, Acrisius succeeded in expelling Prœtus from Argos; they are\r\nsaid to have lived 1400 years B.C. Athamas was a king of Thebes, and\r\nthe contemporary of Acrisius.—B.\r\n\r\n[1417] According to Hardouin, the Lacedæmonians had the helmet, the\r\nsword, and the spear, of a peculiar form, different from that used by\r\nthe other natives of Greece.—B.\r\n\r\n[1418] This account of the invention of the bow and arrow seems to have\r\nbeen derived from the high character which the Scythians and Persians\r\nhad acquired for their dexterity in the use of those weapons.—B.\r\n\r\n[1419] The “amentum” was a leather thong tied to the middle of the\r\njavelin, to assist in throwing it, though it is unknown how it added to\r\nthe effect. It has been suggested that it was by imparting rotation,\r\nand consequent steadiness.\r\n\r\n[1420] Ætolus was said to have been the son of Endymion, of Elis, who,\r\nhaving accidentally killed one of his countrymen, left his native\r\nplace, and settled in the part of Greece named after him, Ætolia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1421] See B. xxviii. c. 6. This was the Roman “veru,” or “verutum,” so\r\ncalled from its resemblance to a spit. Its shaft was three feet and a\r\nhalf long, and its point five inches. The “Velites” did not form part\r\nof the Roman legion, but fought in scattered parties wherever they were\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n[1422] The “pilum” was short and thick; its shaft, often made of\r\ncornel, was partly square, and five feet and a half long. The head was\r\nnine inches long. It was used either to throw or thrust with, and, in\r\nspite of what Pliny says, was peculiar to the Romans.\r\n\r\n[1423] Julius Firmicus ascribes the invention of the apparatus used in\r\nhunting to the Cretans; and Gratius, Cyneg. l. 108, that of the hunting\r\nspear, with its iron spike, to Dercylus, of Amyclæ.—B.\r\n\r\n[1424] Vitruvius informs us, that the catapulta and the balista were\r\ninstruments formed upon the same principle, the former being adapted\r\nfor the discharge of arrows, and the latter, masses of stone. Cæsar,\r\nhowever, in his account of the siege of Massilia, Bell. Civ. B. ii. c.\r\n8, speaks of stones being thrown by the catapulta. Ælian, Hist. Var. B.\r\nvi. c. 12, says, that it was invented by Dionysius, the first king of\r\nSyracuse.—B.\r\n\r\n[1425] Strabo ascribes the invention of the sling to the Ætolians; he\r\ninforms us, that the inhabitants of the Balearic Isles, so famous for\r\ntheir dexterity in the use of this instrument, originally obtained it\r\nfrom the Phrygians.—B.\r\n\r\n[1426] According to Hyginus, Tyrrhenus, the son of Hercules, invented\r\nthe trumpet; Clemens, of Alexandria, and Athenæus, ascribe the\r\ninvention to the Tyrrhenians.—B. Virgil speaks, B. viii. l. 526, of the\r\n“clangor of the Tyrrhenian trumpet.”\r\n\r\n[1427] The “tortoise.” He probably means a military machine, moved on\r\nwheels and roofed over, used in besieging cities, and under which the\r\nsoldiers worked in undermining the walls. It was usually covered with\r\nraw hides or other materials, which could not easily be set on fire.\r\nThe same name was also applied to the covering formed by a compact body\r\nof soldiers, who placed their shields over their heads, and linked them\r\ntogether, to secure themselves against the darts of the enemy. The\r\nlatter kind of “testudo” was sometimes formed, by way of an exercise,\r\nin the games of the Circus.\r\n\r\n[1428] This has been supposed to have been the real origin of the\r\nTrojan horse, on which Virgil has built one of his most interesting\r\nepisodes; the horse, as described by Virgil, was, however, in every\r\nrespect, different from the battering ram.—B.\r\n\r\n[1429] In consequence of some false charges brought against him,\r\nBellerophon was sent to combat with a monster called the Chimæra, in\r\nthe expectation that he would perish in the attempt; but Minerva,\r\npitying his situation, provided him with a winged horse, named Pegasus,\r\nby means of which he accomplished his perilous task in safety.—B.\r\n\r\n[1430] Pelethronius is said to have been a king of the Lapithæ,\r\na people of Thessaly, who were celebrated for their skill in the\r\nmanagement of the horse.—B.\r\n\r\n[1431] According to Cicero, De Nat. Deor. B. iii. c. 23, Minerva was\r\nthe first who used a chariot with four horses. Hardouin supposes that\r\nthe Erichthonius here mentioned was not the king of Athens, but the\r\nson of Dardanus, the king of Troas; he does not state the ground of\r\nhis opinion, and Ælian, Hist. Var. B. iii. c. 38, expressly speaks\r\nof him as an Athenian. Virgil, Geor. B. iii. ll. 113, 114, speaks of\r\nErichthonius as the inventor of the chariot with four horses; he is\r\nsupposed to have lived about 1450 B.C. As Hardouin justly remarks, we\r\nhave an account, in the writings of Moses, of chariots being used by\r\nthe Egyptians long before this period. It is not, however, stated what\r\nwas the number of horses used for these chariots.—B.\r\n\r\n[1432] “Tesseræ,” in the original, which is also the name of the\r\ndice used in various games. But the connection in which the word is\r\nhere placed makes it more probable that it refers to some military\r\noperation; Virgil employs it in this sense, Æneid, B. vii. l. 637, as\r\nalso Livy, B. vii. c. 35. There is, however, a tradition that Palamedes\r\ninvented the games in which dice are used, during the siege of Troy.—B.\r\n\r\n[1433] The words are “auguria ex avibus,” while the art which is said\r\nto have been taught by Tiresias, is termed “extispicio avium.” The\r\nfirst of these consists in foretelling future events, by observing\r\nthe flight, the chirping, or the feeding of birds, the latter by the\r\ninspection of their entrails. But it appears that this distinction is\r\nnot always observed; see Cicero, De Divin. B. i. c. 47. The observation\r\nof the auguries was committed to a body or college of priests, regarded\r\nas of the highest authority in the Roman state. The “Haruspices,”\r\nwhose office it was to inspect the entrails of sacrificed animals, and\r\nfrom their appearance to foretell future events, were considered as an\r\ninferior order.—B.\r\n\r\n[1434] Amphiaraüs was reputed to be the son of Apollo, and was famous\r\nfor his knowledge of futurity; he was one of the Argonauts, and joined\r\nin the expedition of the Epigoni against Thebes, in which he perished.\r\nDivine honours were paid to him after his death, and a temple erected\r\nto his memory, which was resorted to as an oracle.—B.\r\n\r\n[1435] Amphictyon established the celebrated council named after him,\r\nand which consisted of delegates from the principal cities of Greece,\r\nwho assembled at stated periods to decide upon all public questions. He\r\nis supposed to have lived about 1500 B.C.—B.\r\n\r\n[1436] It is very difficult, perhaps impossible, to separate the actual\r\nhistory of Atlas from the mythological and fabulous tales mixed up with\r\nit. We may, however, conclude that he was a king of Libya, or of some\r\npart of the north of Africa; that he was an observer of the heavenly\r\nbodies, and one of the first who gave any connected account of them.\r\nUnder the term “astrology,” Pliny probably intended to comprehend\r\nboth the supposed science, now designated by that name, and likewise\r\nastronomy, or the physical laws of the heavenly bodies.—B.\r\n\r\n[1437] Pliny has previously stated, B. ii. c. 6, that the sphere was\r\ninvented by Atlas, and that Anaximander discovered the obliquity\r\nof the ecliptic, by which he is said “to have opened the doors of\r\nknowledge.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1438] The simplest and most common musical instrument used by the\r\nGreeks, was the “tibia,” or pipe.—B.\r\n\r\n[1439] According to Hardouin, the Phrygians invented the pipes employed\r\nby hired mourners at funerals, or, more probably, were the first to\r\nadopt the use of the pipes at that ceremony.—B.\r\n\r\n[1440] Which was played on the side, like the German flute of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[1441] It was not uncommon for two “tibiæ,” or pipes, to be played upon\r\nby one performer at the same time, one being held in each hand.\r\n\r\n[1442] Apuleius, Flor. B. i. c. 4, characterizes the different kinds\r\nof music, termed “moduli” by Pliny, as follows: the Æolian, as simple,\r\nthe Asiatic varied, the Lydian plaintive, the Phrygian solemn, and the\r\nDoric warlike.—B.\r\n\r\n[1443] According to the mythological traditions, Mercury, when a child,\r\nfound the shell of a tortoise on the banks of the Nile, and made it\r\ninto a lyre, by stretching three strings across; he presented it to\r\nApollo, and he gave it to Orpheus, who added two strings to it; after\r\nthe death of Orpheus, his lyre was placed among the stars, and forms\r\nthe constellation still known by that name.—B.\r\n\r\n[1444] He was a native of Miletus, and contemporary with Philip, the\r\nfather of Alexander the Great. The fact of Timotheus having accompanied\r\nAlexander in his expedition to Asia, which forms the basis of Dryden’s\r\nimmortal Ode, is not supported by any historical authority.—B.\r\n\r\n[1445] Pausanias (Corinth) informs us, that he was the son of Vulcan,\r\nand invented the tibia, but he does not mention his vocal powers.—B.\r\n\r\n[1446] According to Hardouin, the first of these, the “saltatio\r\narmata,” or “armed dance,” was performed on foot, and with wooden\r\narmour; the second, the Pyrrhic dance, was performed on horseback, and\r\nconsisted in the dextrous management of the animals. Pyrrhus, from whom\r\nthe dance received its name, was the son of Achilles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1447] The honour of the invention has been given to Phemonoë, a\r\npriestess of the oracle of Delphi.—B.\r\n\r\n[1448] Apuleius, Flor. B. ii. c. 15, says that Pherecydes was the first\r\nto disregard the fetters of verse, and to write in desultory language.\r\nPliny, however, in B. v. c. 31, has ascribed the invention of prose\r\nto Cadmus. Hardouin endeavours to reconcile this inconsistency, by\r\nsupposing that Cadmus was the first prose writer of history, and that\r\nPherecydes first applied prose to philosophical subjects. But Cicero,\r\nDe Orat. B. ii. c. 12, speaks of Pherecydes as a writer of simple\r\nannals.—B.\r\n\r\n[1449] There are several persons of this name among the kings and\r\nheroes of the semi-fabulous periods; but the one here mentioned is\r\nsaid to have been the son of Phoroneus, and to have lived about 1400\r\nB.C. These games were celebrated in honour of Pan; the combatants\r\nwere naked, and had the body anointed with oil; the Lupercalia of\r\nthe Romans, in many respects, resembled the games of Lycaon. We are\r\ninformed by Livy, B. i. c. 5, that the Lupercalia were introduced into\r\nItaly by Evander, the Arcadian.—B. Ovid, in the Fasti, B. i., states to\r\nthe same effect.\r\n\r\n[1450] Iolcos was a city of Thessaly, from which place the Argonauts\r\nembarked on their expedition to Colchis; Acastus was one of them;\r\nthe funereal games which he instituted were in honour of his father,\r\nPelias.—B.\r\n\r\n[1451] See B. iv. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1452] The Isthmian games were originally instituted by Sisyphus, king\r\nof Corinth; after having been interrupted for some time, they were\r\nre-established by Theseus, who celebrated them in honour of Neptune.—B.\r\n\r\n[1453] These were the celebrated Olympic games; Diodorus Siculus, B.\r\niv. c. 3, Pausanias, and other ancient writers, as well as Pliny,\r\nascribe their origin to Hercules; Pausanias, however, says, that some\r\nsupposed them to have been instituted by Jupiter.—B.\r\n\r\n[1454] “Pila lusoria.” There have been many conjectures respecting the\r\nperson to whom this invention is attributed, as well as respecting\r\nthe nature of the game itself; in either case it appears that we\r\nhave nothing but mere conjecture to direct our opinion.—B. Among the\r\nRomans, the games with the “pila, or ball,” were those played with\r\nthe “pila trigonalis,” so called, probably, from the players standing\r\nin a triangle: the “follis” was a large ball inflated, and used for\r\nfootball. “Paganica” was a similar ball, but harder, being stuffed with\r\nfeathers, and used by rustics. “Harpastum” was a small ball, used by\r\nthe Greeks, and was scrambled for on reaching the ground.\r\n\r\n[1455] The MSS. differ as to the name of the person to whom the\r\ninvention of painting is ascribed; but, in those which are considered\r\nthe most worthy of credit, he is called Gyges Ludius. Marcus endeavours\r\nto prove, that the term “Ludius” refers to the country of Lud or Ludim,\r\nto the south of Egypt; and he points out some analogies between the\r\nname Gyges, and some words which are found in ancient inscriptions,\r\nor which are still in use among the Nubians and Abyssinians. Pliny,\r\nB. xxxv. c. 5, attributes the invention of painting to the Egyptians,\r\nand says, that “it was practised by them long before it was known in\r\nGreece.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1456] The term Euchir, Εὔχειρ, which is literally “dextrous or handy,”\r\nwould rather seem to be a prefix to a name, than a proper name itself.\r\nWith respect to Polygnotus, and the share which he had in the invention\r\nof painting, the reader may examine what Pliny says in a subsequent\r\npart of his work, B. xxxv. c. 35.—B.\r\n\r\n[1457] The vessel in which Danaüs came into Greece, may, probably,\r\nhave been of a much superior construction, or much larger than those\r\npreviously seen in that country; but it is generally supposed, that\r\nCecrops, Cadmus, and the other Egyptian and Phœnician colonists, had\r\ncome by sea to Greece, long before the arrival of Danaüs. In the\r\nancient Egyptian monuments there are representations of different kinds\r\nof vessels of considerable size, which would imply a knowledge of the\r\nart of navigation at a very remote period. The same is proved by the\r\ntraditionary annals of the Egyptians.—B.\r\n\r\n[1458] The word here used, “ratis,” would appear to be applied to any\r\nspecies of slightly built vessel, of whatever form. The term _raft_ is\r\nnot altogether appropriate, but we have no English word which exactly\r\ncorresponds to it.—B.\r\n\r\n[1459] According to the generally received account, Erythras migrated\r\nfrom Persia to Tyrrhina, an island in the Red Sea. See B. vi. c. 28 and\r\n32.—B.\r\n\r\n[1460] It has been conjectured, that the ancient Britons borrowed the\r\npeculiar form of their vessels from the Phœnicians, who were known to\r\nhave frequented the south-west coasts of our island. Small vessels, not\r\nunlike those here described by Pliny, were used very lately, by the\r\nfishermen in the Bristol channel.—B. They are still used by the Welsh\r\nfishermen, and are made of oil-cloth or leather stretched on a frame.\r\nThey are called by the Welch _cwrwgle_, whence our word “coracle.”\r\n\r\n[1461] By the term “longa navis,” here used, Pliny probably designates\r\na vessel which was propelled by a number of rowers, ranged side by\r\nside, in contradistinction to the small skiffs which were moved along,\r\neither by a sail or a single pair of oars, and were more of a rounded\r\nform.—B.\r\n\r\n[1462] Ctesias has already been referred to, in c. 2 of the present\r\nBook.—B.\r\n\r\n[1463] One of her most remarkable exploits was her expedition against\r\nIndia, of which we have an account in Diodorus Siculus, B. ii.; he says\r\nthat she fitted out a fleet of between 2000 and 3000 vessels.—B.\r\n\r\n[1464] From the account of Damastes, given by Hardouin, he was a\r\nnative of Sigæum, whose works appear to have been held in considerable\r\nestimation by the ancients.—B.\r\n\r\n[1465] There were at least three ancient cities of the name Erythræ,\r\nbut the one most noted was situate on the coast of the Ægean Sea,\r\nopposite to the Isle of Chios.—B.\r\n\r\n[1466] The passage in Thucydides here referred to, is in B. i. c. 13.—B.\r\n\r\n[1467] There appears to be much uncertainty respecting the statements\r\nmade in the concluding part of this paragraph, in consequence of the\r\nvariation of the MSS.—B.\r\n\r\n[1468] The position of the rowers, in the vessels of the ancients,\r\nand, more especially, the mode in which the ranks, or “ordines,”\r\nwere disposed with respect to each other, has been a subject of much\r\ndiscussion. From the incidental remarks in the classical writers, and\r\nfrom the representations which still remain, particularly those on\r\nTrajan’s Column, and on certain coins, it would appear that they were\r\ndisposed in stages, one above the other, and provided with oars of\r\ndifferent lengths, in proportion to their distance from the water. But,\r\nalthough we may conceive that this was the case with two or three rows,\r\nit is impossible that a greater number could have been disposed in this\r\nmanner.—B.\r\n\r\n[1469] It is not easy to determine what was the construction and form\r\nof the four kinds of vessels here mentioned, which he designates\r\nrespectively by the terms “lembus,” “cymba,” “celes,” and “cercurus.”\r\nThe “lembus” is mentioned by Livy, B. xxiv. c. 40, as a vessel with two\r\nbenches of oars, “biremis;” and in B. xl. c. 4, he describes it as a\r\nsmall vessel used for towing large ships. The “cymba” has been supposed\r\nto have been a still smaller vessel, answering to our idea of a common\r\nboat; the “celes,” we may suppose, was named from “celer,” being\r\nespecially adapted for quick motion, and the “cercurus” from κερκὸς,\r\n“a tail,” from its long narrow form, or from its having a tail-like\r\nappendage attached to it.—B.\r\n\r\n[1470] Hardouin conjectures, that the cities of Copæ and Plateæ derived\r\ntheir names, respectively, from the inventions here ascribed to them,\r\nκωπὴ and πλατὴ.—B.\r\n\r\n[1471] Pausanias ascribes this invention to Dædalus; Diodorus, B. v. c.\r\n1, to Æolus, who gave his name to the Æolian islands.—B.\r\n\r\n[1472] “Hippagus.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1473] “Tecta longa;” Cæsar, Bell. Civ. B. i. c. 56, says that the\r\nMassilians fitted out long ships, of which eleven were “tectæ.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1474] Ships of war had their prows armed with brazen beaks, to which\r\nsharp spears were attached; these were used in their naval engagements\r\nas instruments of attack, and, when the vessels were captured, were\r\nconsidered the trophies of victory. The tribunal, in the Roman Forum,\r\nfrom which the orators harangued the people, obtained its name of\r\n“Rostra,” from its being ornamented with the beaks of captured ships.—B.\r\n\r\n[1475] The “harpago” and the “manus ferrea” are mentioned by Cæsar,\r\nBell. Civ. B. i. c. 57, and by Livy, B. xxx. c. 10; Quintus Curtius\r\nalso speaks of them, but considers them as only different names for the\r\nsame instrument, B. iv. c. 2, 12.—B.\r\n\r\n[1476] Tiphys was the pilot of the vessel of the Argonauts; he died\r\nbefore the expedition reached Colchis.—B.\r\n\r\n[1477] Hardouin remarks upon this passage, that Pliny probably means\r\nto speak of the persons who first killed oxen or other animals for\r\nwhat may be styled profane purposes; as they had long before this been\r\nemployed for sacrifice.—B.\r\n\r\n[1478] Herodotus, B. v. c. 59, says that the Phœnician letters were\r\nvery similar to the Ionian; and we are informed by Hardouin, that\r\nScaliger, in his Dissertation upon an ancient inscription on a column\r\ndiscovered in the Via Appia, and removed to the Farnese Gardens, has\r\nproved that the Ionians borrowed their letters from the Phœnicians.—B.\r\n\r\n[1479] Herodotus confirms this opinion by a reference to an ancient\r\ntripod at Thebes, written in what he terms Cadmæan letters, having a\r\nstrong resemblance to those used by the Ionians.—B.\r\n\r\n[1480] Tacitus, Ann. B. ix. c. 14, says, “The Latin letters have the\r\nsame form as the most ancient Greek ones.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1481] There is scarcely a letter of this inscription which has not\r\nbeen controverted, and no two editions hardly agree.—B.\r\n\r\n[1482] Probably the earliest existing reference to the practice of\r\nshaving is in Genesis, xli. 14, where Joseph is said to have shaved\r\nand changed his raiment, when brought from prison into the presence of\r\nPharaoh; in this case, we may presume that it was the head, and perhaps\r\nnot the beard, which was shaven.—B.\r\n\r\n[1483] The ancients had two methods of arranging the beard; in one it\r\nwas cut close to the skin, in the other it was trimmed by means of a\r\ncomb, and left of a certain length. These two methods are alluded to\r\nby Plautus, Capt. ii. 2, 16:—B. “Now the old fellow is in the barber’s\r\nshop; at this very instant is the other handling the razor—but whether\r\nto say that he is going to shave him close, or to trim him through the\r\ncomb, I know not.”\r\n\r\n[1484] Varro, De Re Rus. B. ii., states this fact in almost the same\r\nwords. He remarks, in continuation, that the old statues prove that\r\nthere were formerly no barbers, by the length of their beard and\r\nhair.—B.\r\n\r\n[1485] “Africanus sequens;” he was the son of Paulus Æmilius, the\r\nconqueror of Perseus, and the adopted son of Scipio Africanus. In\r\nconsequence of his conquest of Carthage, he was named Africanus the\r\nYounger. His custom of shaving is alluded to by Aulus Gellius, B. iii.\r\nc. 4. From the remarks of these writers, we may conclude that the\r\nRomans were not generally in the habit of shaving until after the age\r\nof forty.—B.\r\n\r\n[1486] “Cultus.” Suetonius gives a different account of the method in\r\nwhich Augustus managed his beard. After remarking upon his carelessness\r\nas to his personal appearance, he says, that Augustus sometimes\r\ncropped, “tonderet,” and sometimes shaved, “raderet,” his beard.\r\nDion. Cassius mentions the period when Augustus began to shave, the\r\nconsulship of L. Marcius Censorinus and C. Calvicius Sabinus, A.U.C.\r\n714; he was then in his twenty-fourth year.—B.\r\n\r\n[1487] In B. ii. c. 78; where Pliny says, that the first clock was\r\nmade at Lacedæmon, by Anaximander; he was the contemporary of Servius\r\nTullius, who commenced his reign 577 B.C.—B.\r\n\r\n[1488] “Accensus;” he was one of the public servants of the\r\nmagistrates, and was so called from his office of summoning the people\r\nto the public meetings (acciere).—B.\r\n\r\n[1489] See also B. xxxiii. c. 6. This was a place in Rome appropriated\r\nto the Greek ambassadors; it is mentioned by Cicero, in a letter to his\r\nbrother, Quintus, B. ii. c. 1.—B. It stood on the right side of the\r\nComitium, being allotted to the Greeks from the allied states, for the\r\npurpose of hearing the debates in the comitia curiata.\r\n\r\n[1490] This column is supposed to have stood near the end of the\r\nForum, on the Capitoline Hill. It was C. Mænius (in whose honour it\r\nwas erected) who defeated the Antiates, and adorned the Forum with\r\nthe “rostra,” or beaks of their ships, from which the “rostrum,” or\r\norator’s stage, took its name. His statue was placed on the column. He\r\nwas consul in B.C. 338. See B. xxxiv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1491] Hardouin supposes that this event took place in the consulship\r\nof Papirius Cursor, A.U.C. 461, B.C. 292. According to the commonly\r\nreceived Chronology, Pyrrhus came into Italy, B.C. 280, twelve years\r\nafter the consulship of Papirius Cursor.—B.\r\n\r\n[1492] According to Censorinus, in his treatise, De Die Natali, it\r\nwas difficult to decide which was the most ancient dial in Rome; some\r\nwriters agreeing with Pliny, that it was the one in the Temple of\r\nQuirinus, others that in the Capitol, and others the one in the Temple\r\nof Diana, on the Aventine.—B.\r\n\r\n[1493] Marcus conjectures, that this account of the dial was contained\r\nin the work of Varro, De Rebus Humanis, referred to by Aulus Gellius,\r\nB. iii. c. 2, but not now extant.—B.\r\n\r\n[1494] Owing to the circumstance of the dial having been adapted to the\r\nlatitude of Catina, now Catania, about four degrees south of Rome.—B.\r\n\r\n[1495] Vitruvius describes this instrument. Marcus, Ajasson, vol.\r\nvi. pp. 218, 219, gives us an account of two kinds of clepsydræ, or\r\nwater-clocks, which were constructed by the Greeks.—B. See also the\r\naccount of clocks in Beckmann’s History of Inventions, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[1496] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1497] He was a contemporary of the Gracchi, and was author of a\r\nHistory of Rome, down to B.C. 145 at least; supposed to have been very\r\nvoluminous and full in its details of the legendary history of the\r\nRoman nation. Livy probably borrowed extensively from it.\r\n\r\n[1498] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1499] A hearer of Ateius Capito, and celebrated as a jurist under\r\nTiberius and later emperors. From him a school of legists, called the\r\nSabiniani, took their rise. He wrote some works on the Civil Law.\r\nPliny quotes him, as we have seen, in c. 4, to show the possibility of\r\ngestation being to the thirteenth month.\r\n\r\n[1500] Daughter of the elder Agrippina and Germanicus, and the mother\r\nof Nero. Her memoirs of her life are quoted by Tacitus, but we have no\r\nremains of them.\r\n\r\n[1501] The great Roman orator and philosopher.\r\n\r\n[1502] A distinguished orator, poet, and historian of the Augustan\r\nage. He was an active partisan of Cæsar, and the patron of Horace and\r\nVirgil, whose property he saved from confiscation. He wrote a history\r\nof the civil war in seventeen books, but none of his works have come\r\ndown to us. His tragedies are highly spoken of by Virgil and Horace.\r\n\r\n[1503] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1504] Nothing whatever seems to be known relative to this author, who\r\nis mentioned in c. 53 of this Book. See the Note to that passage.\r\n\r\n[1505] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1506] The author of the Æneid and the Georgics, the friend of\r\nAugustus, Pollio, and Mæcenas, one of the most virtuous men of ancient\r\ntime, and the greatest probably of the Latin poets.\r\n\r\n[1507] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[1508] Cremutius Cordus, a Roman historian, who was impeached before\r\nTiberius, by two of his clients, for having praised Brutus, and styled\r\nCassius “the last of the Romans,” his real offence being the freedom\r\nwith which, in his work, he had spoken against Sejanus. He starved\r\nhimself to death, and the senate ordered his works to be burnt. Some\r\ncopies, however, were preserved by his daughter, Marcia, and his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n[1509] C. Mæcenas Melissus, a native of Spoletum. He was of free birth,\r\nbut exposed in his infancy, and presented to be reared by Mæcenas. He\r\nwas afterwards manumitted, and obtained the favour of Augustus, who\r\nemployed him to arrange the library in the portico of Octavia. At an\r\nadvanced age he commenced the composition of a collection of jokes and\r\nbon-mots. He also wrote plays of a novel character, which he styled\r\n“Trabeatæ.”\r\n\r\n[1510] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1511] A. Cornelius Celsus, the celebrated writer on medicine. Little\r\nis known of his age or origin, or even his profession. It is supposed,\r\nhowever, that he lived in the time of Augustus and Tiberius. His\r\ntreatises on Medicine and Surgery are still used as hand-books for the\r\nmedical student, and his style is much admired for its purity.\r\n\r\n[1512] Or Valerius Maximus. He is supposed to have lived in the time of\r\nTiberius, and wrote nine books on memorable deeds and sayings, which\r\nstill survive, and are replete with curious information.\r\n\r\n[1513] Trogus Pompeius, the Roman Historian, on whose work Justin\r\nfounded his history. His grandfather, who was of the Gaulish tribe of\r\nthe Vocontii, received the citizenship of Rome during the war against\r\nSertorius; and his father was a private secretary of Julius Cæsar.\r\nExcept as set forth in the pages of Justin, no portion of his history,\r\nexcept a few scattered fragments, exists. The quotations from him in\r\nPliny, are thought to have been all taken from a treatise of his, “De\r\nAnimalibus,” mentioned by Charisius, and not from his historical works.\r\n\r\n[1514] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[1515] The friend and correspondent of Cicero, descended from one\r\nof the most ancient equestrian families of Rome. His surname was,\r\nprobably, given to him from his long residence at Athens, and his\r\nintimate acquaintance with the Greek language and literature. Though,\r\ngenerally, of a virtuous character, he neglected no means of making\r\nmoney, and was, consequently, a man of great opulence. He wrote a book\r\nof Annals, or rather an Epitome of Roman History, which, like the rest\r\nof his works, has perished.\r\n\r\n[1516] He lived in the time of Augustus and Tiberius, and is mentioned\r\nby the Eusebian Chronicle, as becoming blind in his seventy-third year,\r\nduring the reign of Vespasian, and attaining the age of eighty-five.\r\nHe wrote a work on the Life of Sallust, another on the Censurers of\r\nVirgil, and commentaries on the speeches of Cicero, of which alone\r\na few portions are still extant, and are of considerable value in a\r\nhistorical as well as a grammatical point of view.\r\n\r\n[1517] Probably Papirius Fabianus. See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1518] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1519] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[1520] Nothing whatever is known relative to this author.\r\n\r\n[1521] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1522] He is said to have written an epic poem, called Arimaspeia, full\r\nof marvellous stories respecting the Arimaspi and the golden regions.\r\nSee c. 2 of the present Book, and Note [1319] in p. 211, where some\r\nfurther particulars relative to him will be found.\r\n\r\n[1523] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[1524] He was a native of Nicæa, in Bithynia, and the author of some\r\nworks, characterized as being full of incredible stories. Cyril,\r\nhowever, says, that he was born at Cittium, and Gellius styles him a\r\nwriter of no small authority. He is generally looked upon as belonging\r\nto the class of writers called Paradoxographi.\r\n\r\n[1525] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1526] Or Agatharchus, a Greek grammarian of Cnidos. He was, as we\r\nlearn from Strabo, attached to the Peripatetic school of philosophy,\r\nand wrote several historical and geographical works. He was living in\r\nthe reign of Ptolemy Philometer, who died B.C. 146. His works, which\r\nwere very numerous, are enumerated by Photius.\r\n\r\n[1527] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1528] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1529] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1530] Strabo, in B. ii. speaks of a Periplus of Europe, written by a\r\nperson of this name. There was also a physician called Apollonides, a\r\nnative of Cos, who practised at the court of Artaxerxes Longimanus,\r\nwhere he was eventually put to death.\r\n\r\n[1531] A Greek historian of the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, and said by\r\ndifferent authors to have been a native of Athens, Naucratis in Egypt,\r\nand Sicyon. He wrote a work on history, of considerable value, though\r\nhis credit as an historian has been violently attacked by Polybius.\r\n\r\n[1532] Of Cyrene, an author of uncertain date. He wrote a work on the\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\n[1533] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[1534] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1535] Nothing is known of this writer.\r\n\r\n[1536] For Eudoxus of Cnidos, see end of B. ii: and for Eudoxus of\r\nCyzicus, see end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[1537] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1538] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[1539] Of Samos, a descendant of Alcibiades, who flourished in the time\r\nof Ptolemy Philadelphus. When a boy, he gained a pugilistic victory at\r\nOlympia. He eventually became tyrant of Samos; but nothing further is\r\nknown of his career. From what Pliny says, in c. 40. of B. iii., he is\r\nsupposed to have been living in the year B.C. 281. He was the author of\r\na history of Greece, and other historical works, of which, however, we\r\npossess no remains.\r\n\r\n[1540] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1541] Of Cos, the father of the medical art, and in many respects the\r\nmost celebrated physician of ancient or modern times. It is supposed\r\nthat he flourished in the fifth century before Christ. A great number\r\nof medical works, still extant, have been attributed to him: but there\r\nwere many other physicians who either had, or assumed, this name.\r\n\r\n[1542] Of Prusa, in Bithynia. He is mentioned in c. 37 of this Book.\r\nSee Note [1170] in p. 183.\r\n\r\n[1543] Of Ascra, in Bœotia, the earliest of the Greek poets, with the\r\nexception of Homer. His surviving works, are his “Works and Days,” and\r\nthe “Theogony.”\r\n\r\n[1544] Of Teos, in Asia Minor, famous for his amatory and lyric poems;\r\nhe died at the age of eighty-five. Pliny mentions the supposed mode of\r\nhis death, in c. 5, of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[1545] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1546] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1547] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1548] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1549] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1550] A priest of Belus, at Babylonia, and a historian of the time of\r\nAlexander the Great.

He succeeded Theophrastus, B.C. 288, as head of that\r\nschool. He devoted himself to the study of natural science, and appears\r\nto have held a pantheistic system of philosophy. By Cudworth, Leibnitz,\r\nand others, he has been charged with atheism. The “Euremata” of\r\nEphorus, here mentioned, was a book which treated of inventions.\r\n\r\n[1559] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1560] Of Tragilus, in Thrace, a disciple and contemporary of\r\nIsocrates. His book, here mentioned, treated on the subjects chosen by\r\nthe Greek tragic writers, and the manner in which they had dealt with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[1561] Of Cyrene, the friend or disciple of Callimachus. He flourished\r\nunder Ptolemy Philadelphus, about B.C. 249. He wrote works on places\r\nin Asia, on Rivers, and on Islands; but none of his compositions have\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\n[1562] A native of Magnesia, who wrote on rhetoric and history,\r\nprobably in the early part of the third century B.C. Strabo speaks but\r\nslightingly of him; and Cicero and Dionysius of Halicarnassus agree in\r\nlooking upon him as a downright blockhead. Upon the other hand, Varro\r\nrather admires his style. The history of Alexander the Great was his\r\nfavourite theme; and he is represented by Aulus Gellius as dealing\r\nrather largely in the marvellous.\r\n\r\n[1563] Mentioned by Athenæus as having written a history of Eubœa.\r\n\r\n[1564] See end of B. iii.; and see c. 31 of the present Book,\r\nand Note [1133] in p. 175.\r\n\r\n[1565] Nothing whatever appears to be known of this writer.\r\n\r\n[1566] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1567] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1568] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1569] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1570] Cuvier remarks, that this account of its superior intelligence\r\nis exaggerated, it being no greater than that of the dog, if, indeed,\r\nequal to it. The opinion may perhaps have arisen from the dexterity\r\nwith which the animal uses its trunk; but this is to be ascribed not\r\nto its own intelligence, but to the mechanical construction of the\r\npart. The Indians, from whom we may presume that Pliny derived his\r\naccount, have always regarded the elephant with a kind of superstitious\r\nveneration.—B.\r\n\r\n[1571] Some would read this “Amilo,” and others “Annulo.” Hardouin\r\nconsiders it the same with the river Valo, which is mentioned by\r\nPtolemy, B. iv. c. 1, and said to have its rise in the mountains known\r\nas the Seven Brothers, and mentioned in B. v. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[1572] “Præ se ferentes,” probably alluding to the use which the animal\r\nmakes of its trunk in seizing and carrying bodies.—B.\r\n\r\n[1573] “Alienæ religionis.” The meaning of this is doubtful. It may\r\nmean “differences in religion,” or “religious feeling in others,” or\r\nperhaps, to judge from the context, “the religious regard for their\r\noath which others feel.”\r\n\r\n[1574] “Veluti tellure precibus alligata,” one of the harsh\r\nmetaphorical expressions occasionally occurring in Pliny, which it is\r\nvery difficult to translate, and even perhaps fully to comprehend.—B.\r\n\r\n[1575] “Nothi.”\r\n\r\n[1576] Cuvier remarks, that there are two kinds of elephants, one of\r\nwhich attains sixteen feet, and is chiefly known in Cochin China and\r\nTonquin, while those that are domesticated in India are seldom more\r\nthan half that height. They are supposed, however, to be only varieties\r\nof the same species. Pliny, in B. vi. c. 22, gives an account of the\r\nuses which the Indians made of the elephant, and of their different\r\nsizes, but he does not state there that it is the smaller ones only\r\nthat are employed in agriculture.—B.\r\n\r\n[1577] Plutarch informs us, that Pompey had resolved to have his\r\nchariot drawn by four elephants, but finding the gate too narrow, he\r\nwas obliged to use horses.—B.\r\n\r\n[1578] See an account of this, and of the feats performed by the\r\nelephants, in Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 11.—B.\r\n\r\n[1579] The Pyrrhic dance has been referred to in the last Book, c. 57.\r\np. 231. It is not improbable that the elephants employed in this dance\r\nwere caparisoned with armour.\r\n\r\n[1580] However ill adapted the elephant may appear, from its size and\r\nform, for this feat, we have the testimony of Seneca, Suetonius, Dion\r\nCassius, and Julian, to the truth of the fact.—B.\r\n\r\n[1581] Plutarch, in his treatise on the Shrewdness of Animals, tells us\r\nthat this wonderful circumstance happened at Rome.\r\n\r\n[1582] “Eadem illa meditantem,” is the expression. It would be curious\r\nto know in what way the elephant showed that he was “conning” over his\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n[1583] Suetonius is supposed to allude to this circumstance.—B. He\r\ntells us that a horseman ascended a tight rope on an elephant’s back.\r\n\r\n[1584] Ælian informs us, that he had seen an elephant write Latin\r\ncharacters. Hardouin remarks, that the Greek would be Αὐτὸς ἐγὼ τάδ’\r\nἔγραψα, λαφυρά τε Κελτ’ ἀνέθηκα.\r\n\r\n[1585] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1586] As to the tusks of the elephant, no doubt the opinion of\r\nHerodotus, B. iii. c. 97, is correct, that they are teeth, and not\r\nhorns. They are essentially composed of the same substance with the\r\nother teeth, and, like them, are inserted into the jaw, and not into\r\nthe os frontis, as is the case with horns.—B.\r\n\r\n[1587] Not improbably, the great quantity of fossil ivory which has\r\nbeen found, may have given rise to this tale. We have in Lemaire,\r\nvol. iii. p. 581, a long extract from Cuvier’s “_Recherches sur les\r\nossements fossiles_,” in which he gives an account of the parts of the\r\nworld in which the bones of the elephant have been discovered.—B.\r\n\r\n[1588] Tables and bedsteads were not only covered or veneered with\r\nivory among the Romans, but, in the later times, made of the solid\r\nmaterial, as we learn from Ælian and Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[1589] Plutarch, in his treatise on the Shrewdness of Animals, gives\r\nthe same statement respecting the whiteness of the teeth in the young\r\nanimal.—B.\r\n\r\n[1590] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that these statements\r\nrespecting the sagacity of the elephant in connection with their teeth,\r\nare without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1591] The word employed is _vestigium_; it is explained by Ælian to\r\nrefer to the herbage, which has received both the visible impression as\r\nwell as the odour of the foot.—B.\r\n\r\n[1592] In the case of a footstep, this must mean the ground with which\r\nthe foot has come in contact.\r\n\r\n[1593] It is a general opinion, and one founded upon observations of\r\ndaily occurrence, that animals have an instinctive dread of man. We\r\nhave, however, facts stated by travellers of undoubted veracity, which\r\nwould lead to an opposite conclusion. One of the most remarkable is\r\nthe account which Denham gives of the tameness of the birds in Lake\r\nTchad.—B.\r\n\r\n[1594] Cuvier observes, that this is correct; see Ajasson, vol. vi. p.\r\n408, and Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 338.—B.\r\n\r\n[1595] “Novere ea.” It is doubtful whether these words do not mean\r\nsomething more than merely “knew their names,” as Hardouin explains it,\r\nfor that would be nothing wonderful in an elephant. On the other hand,\r\nto say that they were aware of the honour which had been conferred on\r\nthem, in giving the names of famous men, would be to make a statement\r\nwhich exceeds belief; for how could the elephants _show_ that they\r\nappreciated this honour, even supposing that they did appreciate it?\r\nPliny’s elliptical style repeatedly gives rise to doubts of this nature.\r\n\r\n[1596] “Phaleris.” See Notes to B. vii. c. 29, p. 170.\r\n\r\n[1597] Pliny informs us, in B. xxii. c. 4, that this was done by those\r\nconquered in battle.—B.\r\n\r\n[1598] We may conclude, from the account given by Aristotle, Hist.\r\nAnim. B. v. c. 2, and by Ælian, B. viii. c. 17, that this opinion\r\nwas generally adopted by the ancients.—B. We learn from Cuvier, who\r\nmentions the results of M. Corse’s observations, that there is no such\r\nmodesty in the elephant, and that the two at the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory at Paris gave proof of the fact.\r\n\r\n[1599] This is erroneous; the males do not arrive at puberty before the\r\nfemales, which takes place about the fourteenth or fifteenth year. In\r\nthe elephant which was under the inspection of M. Corse, the period of\r\ngestation was between twenty and twenty-one months, so that there may\r\nbe some foundation for the biennial period, but the term of five days\r\nis entirely imaginary. Aristotle makes the interval three years.—B.\r\n\r\n[1600] There is a passage in Suetonius, in his Life of Augustus, and\r\none in Macrobius, where the custom of offering pieces of money to\r\nelephants, which they took up with the proboscis, is referred to.—B.\r\n\r\n[1601] In the Epitome of Livy, B. xiii., it is said, that Valerius\r\nCorvinus was unsuccessful in his engagements with Pyrrhus, in\r\nconsequence of the terror produced by the elephants.—B.\r\n\r\n[1602] Varro, De Ling. Lat. B. vi. calls the elephant “Lucas bos,” “the\r\nLucanian ox,” from the fact of this large quadruped being first seen by\r\nthe Romans in the Lucanian army.—B.\r\n\r\n[1603] According to Seneca, Manius Curius Dentatus was the first who\r\nexhibited elephants in his triumph over Pyrrhus. See also Florus, B. i.\r\nc. 18.—B.\r\n\r\n[1604] There are coins extant struck to commemorate this victory, in\r\nwhich there is the figure of an elephant.—B.\r\n\r\n[1605] The number of elephants brought to Rome by Metellus is\r\ndifferently stated; Florus, B. ii., says that they were “about a\r\nhundred;” in the Epitome of Livy, B. xix., they are one hundred and\r\ntwenty, and the same number is mentioned by Seneca.—B.\r\n\r\n[1606] Who were their allies, or rather vassals; for in such case, they\r\nmight make a dangerous use of them.\r\n\r\n[1607] Val. Maximus, B. ix. c. 2, gives an account of the brutality\r\nof Hannibal on this occasion, in forcing the Roman captives to fight\r\nagainst each other, until only one was left; but he does not make\r\nmention of the combat with the elephant.—B.\r\n\r\n[1608] Florus, B. i. c. 18, states, that this was practised in the\r\nlater engagements with Pyrrhus, and that by these means the elephants\r\nwere either destroyed or rendered useless. Cuvier remarks, that the\r\ntrunk is composed of small muscles and fatty matter, enveloped by a\r\ntendinous membrane, and covered with skin.—B.\r\n\r\n[1609] A.U.C. 678.—B.\r\n\r\n[1610] “Venus the Conqueror.” This temple was dedicated by Pompey,\r\nafter his conquests in the East, in his second consulship, B.C. 55.\r\n\r\n[1611] Pliny here refers to an art, practised among the Romans, of\r\nthrowing up a shield into the air, in such a manner that, after\r\nperforming a circuit, it would fall down on a certain spot; this trick\r\nis also alluded to by Martial, B. ix. Ep. 39.—B. The exercise with\r\nthe boomerang, which was known to the ancient Assyrians, and has been\r\nborrowed in modern times from the people of Australasia, seems to have\r\nbeen somewhat similar to this.\r\n\r\n[1612] “Clathri.” These were gratings of iron trellis-work, placed in\r\nfront of the lowest row of the spectators, to protect them from the\r\nwild beasts. This exhibition took place in Pompey’s Amphitheatre, in\r\nthe Campus Martius. The arena of the amphitheatre was mostly surrounded\r\nby a wall, distinguished by the name of “podium,” which was generally\r\nabout eighteen feet in height, and the top of which was protected by\r\nthis trellis-work. In the present instance, however, the “podium” can\r\nhardly have been so much as eighteen feet in height.\r\n\r\n[1613] “Euripis.” Julius Cæsar caused a canal, ten feet wide, to be\r\nformed in the Circus Maximus, around the bottom of the “podium,” to\r\nprotect the spectators from the wild beasts. These “euripi” probably\r\ntook their name from the narrow channel so called, which lay between\r\nBœotia and the island of Eubœa.\r\n\r\n[1614] We learn, however, from Lampridius, in his Life of Heliogabalus,\r\nthat this euripus was afterwards restored to the Circus.\r\n\r\n[1615] Tacitus and Suetonius mention this separation of the equites\r\nfrom the rest of the spectators: it took place A.U.C. 816.—B. Up to\r\nthe time of Augustus, A.U.C. 758, the senators, equites, and people\r\nsat indiscriminately in the Circus; but that emperor, and after him\r\nClaudius, Nero, and Domitian, separated the senators and the equites\r\nfrom the commons.\r\n\r\n[1616] There are coins which bear the figure of an elephant and the\r\nword Cæsar, probably struck in commemoration of these games.—B.\r\n\r\n[1617] The practice of placing towers filled with soldiers on the backs\r\nof the elephants is alluded to by Lucretius, B. v. l. 1301, and by\r\nJuvenal, Sat. xii. l. 110.—B. It still prevails in India.\r\n\r\n[1618] “Consummation gladiatorum.” There is some doubt about the exact\r\nmeaning of this. It may mean, “at the conclusion of the gladiatorial\r\ngames,” as exhibited; or, what is more probable, “as the crowning\r\nexploit of the gladiators,” who wished thereby to secure their\r\nmanumission, which was granted after remarkable feats of valour. Cælius\r\nRhodiginus, B. xi. c. 11, prefers this last meaning: Dalechamps, with\r\nwhom Ajasson coincides, the first.\r\n\r\n[1619] “Postea singulis.” Those who coincide with Dalechamps and\r\nAjasson, as to the meaning, would read it, that at the end of the\r\ngladiatorial games, the elephants fought singly one against another,\r\nthe gladiators having retired from the arena.\r\n\r\n[1620] Pliny here uses the word “manu,” “hand,” which although, as he\r\nafterwards remarks, it may not be an inappropriate metaphor, could\r\nscarcely be admitted in our language.—B.\r\n\r\n[1621] This trait has been observed in all ages; the elephant has been\r\nknown to remove with its trunk a child lying in its way, and in danger\r\nof being injured. It appears to have an instinctive dread of trampling\r\non a living animal; the same has also been observed in the horse.—B.\r\n\r\n[1622] “Hordeo succo;” the exact meaning has been the subject of much\r\ndiscussion; it probably refers to some preparation of barley used by\r\nthe ancients, perhaps a maceration of the corn in water; it is scarcely\r\nto be supposed, however, that the words are to be taken literally.—B.\r\n\r\n[1623] Albertus Magnus, in his work on Animals, B. viii. c. 3, gives\r\na fuller account of this method of taking the wild elephant. He says:\r\n“A man, riding on a tame elephant, guides him to the woods, and when\r\nhe has met with some wild ones, drives the tame one against them,\r\nand makes it strike them with its trunk: the tame one, being better\r\nfed, soon conquers the wild elephant, and throws him to the ground;\r\nupon which, the man leaps upon him, and flogs him with a whip, and\r\nimmediately the other becomes quiet.” Strabo, B. xv., gives a different\r\naccount of the mode of catching and taming the elephant in India.\r\n\r\n[1624] This appears to have been taken from Plutarch; and we have the\r\nsame statement in Ælian, who particularly speaks of the sagacity of the\r\nanimal, in endeavouring to extricate itself from the trench.—B.\r\n\r\n[1625] We have the same account given by Ælian and by Strabo.—B.\r\n\r\n[1626] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 18, remarks, that the violence\r\nof the animal, which is produced by an accidental cause, as also that\r\narising from venereal excitement, are counteracted by opposite modes of\r\ntreatment; the one by depriving it of food, the other by over-feeding\r\nit; the former, in order to break its strength, and the latter, to\r\ndivert it into a different channel.—B.\r\n\r\n[1627] Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. i. c. 38, states that the Romans employed\r\nthis mode of terrifying the elephants brought against them by\r\nPyrrhus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1628] That this was the general opinion among the ancients, we learn\r\nfrom Polybius, Ælian, Livy, Diodorus Siculus, and others. Cuvier\r\nremarks, that this may have been the case with the animals from\r\nBarbary, or the north of Africa, but that it is not so with those from\r\nthe middle or south of that continent.—B.\r\n\r\n[1629] It has been stated, in a Note to chap. 5, that Mr. Corse found\r\nthe period of the gestation of the elephant to be between twenty and\r\ntwenty-one months.—B.\r\n\r\n[1630] Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 31, considers the age of sixty to be\r\nthe prime period of their life, not the commencement of their prime.—B.\r\n\r\n[1631] This remark is incorrect; when the water is sufficiently deep,\r\nit swims with ease; and if the end of the trunk remains exposed to\r\nthe atmosphere, it can dive below the surface, or swim with the body\r\nimmersed.—B.\r\n\r\n[1632] Cuvier remarks, that this statement is incorrect. He dissected\r\nthree elephants at Paris, and found that their death had been caused by\r\ninflammation of the lungs and chest. The species of elephant, which now\r\ninhabits Asia and Africa, is certainly not adapted to a cold climate;\r\nbut the numerous remains of elephants found in the north of Asia, prove\r\nthat a species formerly existed, capable of enduring great cold. It is\r\nto be observed, that this species was covered with a thick, furry coat\r\nof wool and hair.—B.\r\n\r\n[1633] This is from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 26; but it is\r\nscarcely necessary to remark, that it is without foundation. Ælian,\r\nAnim. Nat. B. ii. c. 18, refers to it, and explains it by supposing\r\nthat the oil was not drunk, but applied externally; which is less\r\nimprobable.—B.\r\n\r\n[1634] They suck the fluid into the cavity of the trunk, and bend the\r\ntrunk into the mouth, where it is received and swallowed in the usual\r\nmanner.—B.\r\n\r\n[1635] This dislike is confirmed by Cuvier.—B.\r\n\r\n[1636] “Sanguisuga.”\r\n\r\n[1637] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 1, remarks, that the elephant\r\nis the least hairy of all animals.—B.\r\n\r\n[1638] Cuvier remarks, that the trunk, being composed of a mixture of\r\ndelicate muscular fibres and rich fat, would, when properly prepared,\r\nafford an article of food that might be very palatable.—B.\r\n\r\n[1639] We learn from Livy, B. xlii. c. 23, that Gulussa was the son of\r\nMassinissa.—B.\r\n\r\n[1640] In c. 8 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1641] We learn from Cuvier, that the elephants of Africa and Asia\r\nbelong to different species, distinguished by the form of the head, and\r\nsome peculiarities in the structure of the teeth.—B.\r\n\r\n[1642] By the term “dragon,” we may suppose that Pliny refers to some\r\nof the great serpents which exist in hot climates, and are of such vast\r\nsize, that they might perhaps be able to perform some of the exploits\r\nhere ascribed to the dragon.—B.\r\n\r\n[1643] This account appears to be entirely without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1644] The idea of the elephant’s blood being cold, and sought after by\r\nthe dragon, is, of course, without foundation; its blood being of the\r\nsame temperature with that of other quadrupeds.—B.\r\n\r\n[1645] Cuvier states, that in India and America there are serpents of\r\nthe genus boa, or python, thirty feet or more in length. He observes,\r\nthat there are various species of aquatic reptiles in the seas of\r\nIndia, but that they never swim twisted together, or with their heads\r\nelevated. Ælian gives an account of the great size of the dragons in\r\nÆthiopia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1646] Cuvier remarks, that there are no serpents with crests on the\r\nhead, and that Juba must have been thinking probably of some animal of\r\nthe genus lacertus, when he made this statement. We may here remark,\r\nthat the “basiliscus,” or “king of serpents,” was said by the poets to\r\nhave a crown on its head, as denoting its kingly rank. See c. 33 of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[1647] It is well known, that certain serpents have the jaws and fauces\r\nso constructed, that they will allow of the passage of an animal more\r\nbulky than themselves; they first crush its bones, and form it into\r\na kind of pulp, and then pass it, without further change, into the\r\nstomach, where it is slowly dissolved by the gastric juices.—B.\r\n\r\n[1648] Supposed to have been in Mysia, or Bithynia, considerably to the\r\nwest of Pontus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1649] This account is entirely without foundation. The same statement\r\nis made by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. ii. c. 21, who probably copied it from\r\nMetrodorus. There are stories of the power which serpents possess of\r\nfascinating birds by the eye, but they are not improbably without\r\nfoundation.—B. There is little doubt, however, that some serpents have\r\nthe power, by some means or other, of fascinating the birds which they\r\nmake their prey.\r\n\r\n[1650] This is referred to by many ancient writers; among others, by\r\nLivy, B. xviii.; Florus, B. ii. c. 2; Valerius Maximus, B. i. c. 8; and\r\nAulus Gellius, B. vi. c. 3.—B.\r\n\r\n[1651] As Cuvier remarks, it is difficult to conceive what he means\r\nby the boa of Italy. At the present day, the longest Italian serpents\r\nare the Æsculapian serpent (a harmless animal), and the “Coluber\r\nquadrilineatus” of Linnæus, neither of which exceeds ten feet in\r\nlength. The one here mentioned, was probably, as Cuvier suggests, one\r\nof the genuine boa or python species; but, as he says, where did it\r\ncome from? and how did it get there?\r\n\r\n[1652] It is doubtful whether any one ever witnessed a serpent sucking\r\na cow, but it seems to have been generally believed, and it is\r\ntherefore probable, that the name of the animal was derived from this\r\ncircumstance.—B. It is still believed of the common snake in some parts\r\nof this country. The reading “primo” has been preferred to “trimo,”\r\nthat adopted by Sillig.\r\n\r\n[1653] Cuvier remarks upon the two animals here mentioned, the bison\r\nand the urus, that Europe, at the present time, contains only one\r\nspecies of wild ox, the bison, or aurochs of the Germans, which still\r\nexists, although in small numbers only, in the forests of Lithuania.\r\nThere are, however, fossil remains, in different parts of the north of\r\nEurope, of other animals of the same genus, which may have been the\r\nurus of Pliny, and not extinct when he wrote. Ajasson, vol. vi. pp.\r\n413, 414; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 365. The description by Cæsar of the\r\nurus of Gaul, Bell. Gall. B. vi. c. 26, seems to agree with the remains\r\nof the fossil animal, and may, therefore, be considered as confirming\r\nthe opinion, that both animals were in existence when Pliny wrote.—B.\r\n\r\n[1654] This appears to have been a species of antelope, the Antelope\r\nbubalus of Linnæus. Cuvier observes, that Strabo places it among the\r\ngazelles, and Aristotle associates it with the stag and the deer, while\r\nOppian’s description of the urus, agrees with those of the gazelle.—B.\r\n\r\n[1655] We learn from various travellers, that there are troops of\r\nwild horses and asses in many parts of Tartary and the neighbouring\r\ncountries; but it is doubtful whether they have proceeded from\r\nan original wild stock, or may not have been the produce of some\r\nindividuals which had accidentally escaped from the domestic state.—B.\r\n\r\n[1656] No doubt Pliny has fallen into an error on this subject, and his\r\nelk and achlis are, in reality, the same animal. The description of the\r\nlatter, for the most part, applies to the former, with the exception of\r\nthe want of joints in the legs, which is entirely without foundation.\r\nCæsar’s account of the elk, Bell. Gall. B. vi. c. 27, agrees generally\r\nwith Pliny’s account of the achlis; he also says, that the legs of the\r\nalces are “without articulations and joints.”\r\n\r\n[1657] The Romans had but a very imperfect knowledge of the\r\nScandinavian peninsula. They supposed it to be surrounded by the ocean,\r\nand to be composed of many islands, which Ptolemy calls Scandiæ. Of\r\nthese, the largest bore especially the name of Scandia or Scandinavia,\r\nby which name the modern Sweden was probably indicated. See B. iv. c.\r\n30.\r\n\r\n[1658] Pliny’s account is from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 45,\r\nbut, as is often the case, with considerable exaggerations. Aristotle\r\nsays, that these animals eject their excrements to a distance of four\r\nfeet, and that it is of so acrid a nature, as to cause the hair of the\r\ndog to fall off. The word jugerum is generally used as a measure of\r\nsuperficial surface.—B.\r\n\r\n[1659] Pliny here renders the Greek πλέθρον, by “jugerum,” which is\r\nordinarily a measure of superficies. In the present case, therefore, it\r\nmust mean a measure of _length_, of 100 Grecian, or 104 Roman feet.\r\n\r\n[1660] The pard of Pliny, as we shall find stated below, is the male of\r\nthe panther.\r\n\r\n[1661] Cuvier remarks, that all the feline animals have retractile\r\nclaws, drawn by an elastic ligament into a sheath, and protruded when\r\nrequired for the purpose of prehension. The sheath is formed of a\r\nduplicature or fold of the skin and the subjacent cellular membrane.—B.\r\n\r\n[1662] What Pliny states here, is without foundation. He supposes\r\nthat the leopard is the produce of a pard, or male panther, and the\r\nfemale of the lion; but this is incorrect, the leopard being a distinct\r\nspecies of animal.—B.\r\n\r\n[1663] Herodotus, B. iii. c. 108, gives the same account, which is\r\nrefuted by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 31. Aulus Gellius, B. xiii.\r\nc. 7, refers to Herodotus, and the refutation by Aristotle.—B.\r\n\r\n[1664] The account here given of the lioness generally, Aristotle gives\r\nrespecting the Syrian lioness only, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 31; there is\r\nsome reason to believe that Aristotle is not correct in what he says.\r\nThe account given by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 33, is nearly the same\r\nwith that of Pliny.—B.\r\n\r\n[1665] There is much in this account that is incorrect. It is well\r\nascertained that the cubs of the lion are proportionably as large and\r\nas perfectly formed as the young of other animals that belong to the\r\nsame family.—B.\r\n\r\n[1666] Herodotus, B. vii. c. 126, and Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii.\r\nc. 28, give a similar account of the district in which lions are\r\nfound.—B. Littré remarks, that this statement of Pliny is probably\r\nformed, as originally suggested by M. Maury, upon the fact, that the\r\nlions of Europe, as we learn from Herodotus, attacked the camels of\r\nXerxes, on his invasion of Europe.\r\n\r\n[1667] Cuvier remarks, that we have no knowledge of the lion with\r\ncurled hair, so frequently spoken of by the ancients. He suggests that\r\nthere may have been a peculiar variety between the rivers Achelous and\r\nNestus or Mestus, or perhaps, more probably, that it was altogether\r\nimaginary. He states also, that we no longer see lions without manes,\r\nbut that Olivier had seen some at Bagdat. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix.\r\nc. 44, speaks of the two species of lions, and describes them nearly as\r\nPliny has done.—B.\r\n\r\n[1668] According to Cuvier, this is not the case; the lion passes its\r\nurine just as the other animals of the same family. Pliny again refers\r\nto the odour of the lion’s breath, in B. xi. c. 115.—B.\r\n\r\n[1669] The lion, like other carnivorous animals, is able to receive\r\na large quantity of food into the stomach, and to remain for a\r\nproportionably longer period without eating; but the statement\r\nrespecting its taking food on alternate days, is without foundation.\r\nThere does not appear to be any ground for the account of the mode by\r\nwhich it relieves the stomach when overcharged.—B.\r\n\r\n[1670] We learn from Cicero, Ep. Fam. B. v. Ep. 12, that Polybius wrote\r\na history of the Numantine war, in which we may presume the account\r\nhere referred to was contained.—B.\r\n\r\n[1671] Although these accounts of the generosity and clemency of the\r\nlion are in a great measure fabulous, still the accounts of those\r\nwho have had the best opportunity of becoming acquainted with the\r\ncharacter of different animals, agree in ascribing to it less ferocity\r\nand brutality, in proportion to its size and strength, than to other\r\nanimals of the same family.—B.\r\n\r\n[1672] In various countries, and more especially in Egypt, the\r\nmagicians profess to charm serpents by incantations; and it appears\r\nthat they are able to acquire some power over them by imitating their\r\nnatural cries. Cuvier informs us, that Geoffroi St. Hilaire had\r\nwitnessed the fact, and was himself able to produce the effect.—B.\r\n\r\n[1673] Aristotle says, a matter of a _yellow_ colour, ἰχῶρες ὠχροὶ.\r\n\r\n[1674] Probably, there is no foundation for this opinion: it does not\r\nappear that any animal, except man, has the faculty of weeping, i. e.\r\nof shedding tears, in connection with a peculiar condition of mind and\r\nfeeling.—B. But query as to the horse. See c. 64 of the present Book,\r\nand the Introduction to vol. i. p. xvii.\r\n\r\n[1675] This supposed fear is without foundation, but appears to have\r\nbeen a generally received opinion, as it is referred to by Lucretius,\r\nB. iv. l. 714-725.—B.\r\n\r\n[1676] Seneca gives an account of this exhibition; he says that the\r\nlions were turned loose into the Circus, and that spearmen were sent by\r\nking Bocchus, who killed them with darts. Sylla was prætor A.U.C. 661,\r\nB.C. 92.—B.\r\n\r\n[1677] “Sagum.” This was the cloak worn by the Roman soldiers and\r\ninferior officers, in contradistinction to the “paludamentum“ of the\r\ngeneral and superior officers. It was open in the front, and usually,\r\nthough not always, fastened across the shoulders by a clasp. It was\r\nthick, and made of wool.\r\n\r\n[1678] This story is given also by Plutarch, in the life of Demetrius.\r\nLysimachus was a Macedonian by birth, but son of Agathocles, a serf of\r\nThessaly. Through his great courage, he became one of the body-guard\r\nof Alexander. Quintus Curtius tells us that, when hunting in Syria,\r\nhe killed a lion of immense size single-handed, though not without\r\nreceiving severe wounds in the contest. The same author looks upon this\r\nas the probable origin of the story here referred to by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1679] This is mentioned by many ancient authors; by Plutarch,\r\nPausanias, Seneca, Justin, and by Quintus Curtius, who thinks that the\r\naccount usually given is fabulous.—B.\r\n\r\n[1680] Related by Plutarch, as among the acts of extravagance and\r\nfolly, committed by Antony, which gave much disgust to the grave and\r\nrespectable citizens of Rome.—B.\r\n\r\n[1681] A famous courtezan of the time of Cicero; being originally the\r\nfreedwoman and mistress of Volumnius Eutrapelus, and then successively\r\nthe mistress of Antony and the poet Gallus, who mentioned her in\r\nhis poems under the name of Lycoris; she did not, however, continue\r\nfaithful to him.\r\n\r\n[1682] Aulus Gellius, B. v. c. 14, and Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. viii. c.\r\n48, relate a similar anecdote of Androclus or Androcles, who extracted\r\na thorn from the foot of a lion.—B.\r\n\r\n[1683] The text is in a state of extreme confusion here, and so\r\nhopelessly mangled, that we can only guess at the sense of it. In\r\nSillig’s edition, which is generally followed, it runs to this effect:\r\n“Neque profugienti, cum potuisset, fera institerat et procumbens ad\r\narborem hiatu quo terruerat miserationem quærebat. Os morsu avidiore\r\ninhæserat dentibus cruciabatque inedia, tum pœna in ipsis ejus telis\r\nsuspectantem ac velut mutis precibus orantem, dum fortuitu fidens non\r\nest contra feram; multoque diutius miraculo quam metu cessatum est.”\r\nThus paraphrased by Sillig, who devotes a long Note to it: “The lion,\r\ntherefore, being tormented by hunger and excessive pain, and thus\r\npunishing himself for his greediness in his own weapons (his teeth),\r\nlooked up, and besought Elpis with silent prayers, as it were, not, as\r\nhe trusted to the protection fortuitously given by the branches, to\r\nshow himself distrustful of a wild beast.”\r\n\r\n[1684] This remark refers to what Pliny has related in c. 5, respecting\r\nthe sagacity of the elephant.—B.\r\n\r\n[1685] Cuvier remarks, that this “panthera” is not the same as the\r\nπάνθηρ of the Greeks. From the description of its spots and other\r\ncircumstances, he thinks that it was one of the African animals,\r\nknown by modern naturalists as the leopard, which appear to have been\r\nconfounded by the Romans with the panther. The term “leopardus” is\r\nnot met with until after the age of Pliny; it was supposed to be the\r\nproduce of the pardus, or male panther, and the lioness.—B.\r\n\r\n[1686] “Assectatoris sapientiæ”—“A follower of wisdom;” meaning a\r\n“philosopher.”\r\n\r\n[1687] This word here signifies, simply, a “serpent.”\r\n\r\n[1688] Ælian, Var. Hist. B. xiii. c. i., relates an occurrence of this\r\nkind, about Atalanta, and Justin, B. xliv. c. 4, about Habis, a king of\r\nSpain. As to the account of Romulus having been suckled by a wolf, it\r\nwas generally regarded as a legendary tale by the Romans themselves.\r\nSee Livy, B. i. c. 4, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiq. Rom. B.\r\ni.—B.\r\n\r\n[1689] Pliny, in B. xiii. c. 15, speaks of “tables of tiger and panther\r\npattern,” as articles of ornamental furniture among the Romans, named\r\nfrom the peculiar patterns of the veins in the citrus wood, of which\r\nthey were formed.—B.\r\n\r\n[1690] This, though mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 8, is\r\nprobably incorrect; and still more the addition made by Ælian, Anim.\r\nNat. B. v. c. 40, that this odour is grateful to man. It has, however,\r\ninduced some to conjecture, that the animal here described might be the\r\ncivet; but the description given is inapplicable to that animal; nor,\r\nindeed, does the civet appear to have been known to the ancients. For\r\nfurther information, see the remarks of Cuvier, Ajasson, vol. vi. p.\r\n420, and Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 386. Pliny, in B. xxi. c. 18, says that\r\nno animal, except the panther, has any odour.—B.\r\n\r\n[1691] Meaning the “spotted” or “parti-coloured” female.\r\n\r\n[1692] Xenophon, in his Cynegeticon, says, that the pard is found on\r\nMount Pangæus, in Macedonia; the truth of which is denied by Aristotle,\r\nwho says that it is not to be found in Europe.\r\n\r\n[1693] He was tribune A.U.C. 670. Cicero says, Tusc. Quæst. B. iv. c.\r\n39, that Aufidius, although blind, was eminent for his political and\r\nliterary talents. He wrote a History of Greece.—B.\r\n\r\n[1694] 4th of May, A.U.C. 696.—B.\r\n\r\n[1695] See also Suetonius, Life of Augustus. Martial, Spect. Ep. 18,\r\nrelates a circumstance respecting a tame tiger, which occurrence\r\nappears to have taken place at the time when he wrote. Heliogabalus\r\nyoked tigers to his car, in imitation of Bacchus, as we are informed by\r\nLampridius.\r\n\r\n[1696] “In cavea.” In the arena or centre of the amphitheatre. This\r\nword often signifies, however, the place where the senators, equites,\r\nand plebeians, sat in the theatre: and in the later writers it is used\r\nto signify the whole amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[1697] A.U.C. 742.—B.\r\n\r\n[1698] In the winter of 1809 and 1810, an antique mosaic pavement was\r\ndiscovered at Rome, in which four tigers are represented, and which,\r\nit has been supposed, might possibly have some reference to those\r\nexhibited by Claudius. Martial, who lived a little after Pliny, speaks\r\nof tigers exhibited at Rome, by Domitian, in considerable numbers.\r\nEpig. B. viii. Ep. 26.—B.\r\n\r\n[1699] Cuvier remarks, that the account given of the two kinds of\r\ncamels, and his description generally, is correct, with the exception\r\nof their antipathy to the horse. The caravans, he says, present a\r\nconstant mixture of the two animals, and even, in Arabia, the young\r\nfoals are occasionally suckled by the female camel.—B.\r\n\r\n[1700] We have a similar statement in Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c.\r\n1. Indeed, the account here given generally, is taken from him.—B.\r\n\r\n[1701] See B. xi. c. 62.\r\n\r\n[1702] Mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 17, and by Ælian,\r\nAnim. Nat. B. iii. c. 7; but, as stated above, it is incorrect.—B.\r\n\r\n[1703] At the time of rutting, according to Solinus.\r\n\r\n[1704] He speaks here of only _one_ of the animals which resemble the\r\ncamel; the giraffe, namely. The other, which he for the present omits,\r\nis the ostrich.\r\n\r\n[1705] The description of the giraffe, here given, is sufficiently\r\ncorrect, but we have a more minute account of it by Dion Cassius, B.\r\nxliii. In the time of the Emperor Gordian, ten of these animals were\r\nexhibited at Rome at once; a remarkable fact, when we bear in mind that\r\nso few have been imported into Europe for many centuries past. The\r\ngiraffe is figured in the mosaic at Præneste, and under it is inscribed\r\nits name, nabi.—B. It has been found that it is unable to bear the\r\nwinters of Europe.\r\n\r\n[1706] Its form being like that of the camel, while its spots resemble\r\nthose of the leopard. Horace refers to it, when speaking of an object\r\ncalculated to excite the vulgar gaze; “Diversum confusa genus panthera\r\ncamelo”—“The race of the panther mingled with the camel,” Ep. B. ii.;\r\nEp. i. l. 195.\r\n\r\n[1707] According to Dion Cassius, B. xliii., these games were\r\ncelebrated A.U.C. 708.—B.\r\n\r\n[1708] This comparison can only be employed to indicate the mild nature\r\nof the giraffe.—B.\r\n\r\n[1709] In the older editions, the names here given to this animal were\r\n“chaus” and “ruphius;” the alteration was made by Hardouin from a MS.\r\nin the Royal Library of Paris, which he deemed of high authority, and\r\nhas been adopted by all the modern editors. There is considerable\r\ndoubt respecting the animal here designated by the name of “chama;” it\r\nappears to have been an inhabitant of Gaul, and in c. 34, is styled\r\n“lupus cervarius;” but the account does not enable us to identify it\r\nwith any animal known to exist in that country.—B. It is generally\r\nsupposed to have been a species of lynx.\r\n\r\n[1710] No doubt this description refers to some species of the monkey\r\ntribe, but it is uncertain to what one in particular. Its having been\r\nseen only once at Rome, shows that it was not of the most common kind;\r\nCuvier, however, thinks it probable, that Pliny may have been incorrect\r\nin this; he supposes that it was the “Simia sphinx” of Linnæus, Lem.\r\nvol. iii. p. 395. According to Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 8,\r\nκηβος is merely a monkey with a tail; see also the account of Ælian,\r\nAnim. Nat. B. xvii. c. 8.—B.\r\n\r\n[1711] Cuvier says, that this was the single-horned rhinoceros\r\nof India. The commentators have been at a loss to reconcile this\r\ndescription with the Epigram of Martial, Spect. Ep. xxii., where he\r\nspeaks of the rhinoceros exhibited by Domitian, as having two horns.\r\nIt has been proved that this latter was of the two-horned species, by\r\nthe medals of that emperor, now in existence. Martial, Spect. Ep. ix.,\r\nseems also to have been acquainted with the single-horned species. That\r\nwith two horns is mentioned by Pausanias as the Æthiopian bull. We\r\nlearn from modern naturalists, that the two-horned species is a native\r\nof the southern parts of Africa, while that with one horn is from\r\nAsia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1712] The other enemy is the dragon, as described in c. 11 and 12 of\r\nthe present Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1713] According to Cuvier, the lynx of Pliny is the Felis caracal of\r\nLinnæus: it is common in many parts of Asia and Africa, in the retired\r\nforest districts, and still exists in the Pyrenees and the mountains of\r\nNaples.—B.\r\n\r\n[1714] As far as the accounts of the sphinx are to be regarded as\r\nnot entirely fabulous, we must suppose it to have originated in\r\nsome species of the monkey tribe; perhaps the Simia troglodytes or\r\nchimpanzé.—B.\r\n\r\n[1715] Of course the winged horse is an imaginary being, nor does\r\nit appear what is the origin of the fable; the horns are an unusual\r\nappendage to the pegasus.—B. The pegasus and the rhinoceros together\r\nmay have given rise to that fabulous animal, the unicorn. See, however,\r\nthe Monoceros, mentioned in c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1716] Although a hybrid animal is produced by the union of the wolf\r\nand the dog, it does not form a permanent species. But, as Cuvier\r\nremarks, by the insertion of “velut,” Pliny seems to imply that the\r\ncrocotta unites the physical properties of the two animals. Ctesias,\r\nIndic. c. 32, gives an account of the cynolycus, or “dog-wolf,” from\r\nwhich Pliny seems to have taken his crocotta.—B.\r\n\r\n[1717] It does not seem possible to determine what species of monkey is\r\nhere designated; it is most probable that he himself had no accurate\r\nknowledge.—B.\r\n\r\n[1718] We may here refer to the judicious remarks of Cuvier, Ajasson,\r\nvol. vi. pp. 427, 428, and Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 399, on the\r\nleucrocotta. It seems impossible to identify Pliny’s description with\r\nany known animal, and it is not unlikely that he has confused the\r\naccounts of authors who were speaking of different animals. Some of\r\nthe characteristics of the leucrocotta agree with those of the Indian\r\nantelope, while others seem to resemble those of the hyæna.—B.\r\n\r\n[1719] Perhaps the eale may have been the two-horned rhinoceros, as\r\nsome naturalists say that there is a degree of mobility in the horns\r\nof that animal; the same observation has been made with respect to the\r\nwild or forest bulls, the description of which animal, in Pliny, is\r\nprobably from Diodorus Siculus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1720] This description of the mantichora appears to be taken from the\r\nIndica of Ctesias; it has been also adopted by Aristotle and Ælian, but\r\nthey have qualified their accounts by some expressions of doubt, which\r\nare omitted by Pliny. It has been conjectured, that Ctesias took his\r\ndescription from the hieroglyphic figures in his time, probably common\r\nin the East, and still found in the ruins of the Assyrian and Persian\r\ncities, Nineveh and Persepolis, for instance.—B.\r\n\r\n[1721] Probably meaning, “not cloven.”\r\n\r\n[1722] Cuvier conjectures, that this is from Ctesias, and says, that a\r\nsimilar animal is to be seen on one of the sculptures of Persepolis.—B.\r\n\r\n[1723] Probably the stag of the Ganges, the “Cervus axis” of Linnæus;\r\nbut if so, Pliny has omitted to mention the horns.—B.\r\n\r\n[1724] White apes are now unknown, as a distinct species, but\r\nindividuals are occasionally found nearly without colour.—B.\r\n\r\n[1725] The “one-horned,” or the unicorn.\r\n\r\n[1726] We have a discussion by Cuvier, respecting the existence of\r\nthe unicorn, or of any animal similar to that here described, with\r\na single horn. He remarks, that the only single-horned quadruped of\r\nwhich we have any certain knowledge, is the rhinoceros, and that the\r\nonly horns which have been discovered, and which can have been single\r\nhorns, belong to it. There are five animals mentioned by the ancients,\r\nas having single horns, the Indian ass, the single-horned horse, the\r\nsingle-horned ox, the monoceros, described in the text, and the oryx\r\nof Africa, which Pliny speaks of in c. 79 of this Book, and in B.\r\nxi. c. 106. There are many curious accounts given by travellers of\r\nacknowledged veracity, respecting animals seen in the more remote parts\r\nof Asia and Africa, answering to the description of the unicorn, and\r\nthere are representations of the same in ancient sculptures; but they\r\ndo not amount to that kind of evidence which can at all supply the\r\nplace of direct proof.—B.\r\n\r\n[1727] These will be found in B. v. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1728] From καταβλέπω, “to look downwards.”\r\n\r\n[1729] Ælian describes this animal more in detail, Anim. Nat. B.\r\nvii. c. 5. Cuvier thinks it probable that it is the Antelope gnu; he\r\nremarks, that it has a very peculiar and mournful appearance; Ajasson,\r\nvol. vi. p. 435; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 405.—B.\r\n\r\n[1730] This account of the basilisk’s eye, like that of the catoblepas,\r\nis entirely devoid of foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1731] Many species have certain marks on the head, which were supposed\r\nto resemble a crown.—B.\r\n\r\n[1732] There is probably no foundation for this account of the action\r\nof the effluvium of the weasel upon the basilisk or any other species\r\nof serpent.—B.\r\n\r\n[1733] Hence the proverbial expression applied to a person who is\r\nsuddenly silent upon the entrance of another; “Lupus est tibi visus.”\r\n\r\n[1734] Cuvier says, that the wolves of Africa are of the ordinary size,\r\nand conjectures that this remark probably applies to the chakale, or\r\n“Canis aureus” of Linnæus, which is of the colour of the wolf, and the\r\nsize of the fox, and is common throughout all Africa.—B.\r\n\r\n[1735] The opinion that men were converted into wolves by enchantment,\r\nor a preternatural agency, was at one time so generally received, as to\r\nhave led to judicial processes, and the condemnation of the supposed\r\ncriminal.—B. To the relator of the above story that men lose their\r\nvoice on seeing a wolf, Scaliger wishes as many blows as at different\r\ntimes he had seen a wolf without losing his voice.\r\n\r\n[1736] This literally means “changing the skin;” was applied by some\r\nancient medical writers to a peculiar form of insanity, where the\r\npatient conceives himself changed into a wolf, and named λυκανθρώπια,\r\n“lycanthropy.” The word appears to have been in common use among the\r\nRomans, and to have been applied by them to any one who had undergone a\r\nremarkable change in his character and habits; in this sense it is used\r\nby Plautus, Amphitryon, Prol. l. 123, and Bacchides, A. iv. sc. 4, l.\r\n12.—B.\r\n\r\n[1737] It is not known who is here referred to; it is not probable that\r\nit is Fabius Pictor, the Roman historian.—B.\r\n\r\n[1738] It is rather curious to find Pliny censuring others for\r\n_credulity_; indeed he loses no opportunity of a hit at the Greeks, to\r\nwhom, after all, he is greatly indebted. See Introduction to vol. i. p.\r\n17.\r\n\r\n[1739] An account of the victories gained at the Olympic games.—B.\r\n\r\n[1740] It has been conjectured, that the epithet, “Lycæan,” Λύκαιος,\r\nwas given to Jupiter by the Arcadians, for this supposed conversion\r\nof men into wolves, which was conceived to be effected by divine\r\ninterposition.—B.\r\n\r\n[1741] It does not appear what is the foundation of this opinion; of\r\ncourse, it is without truth.—B.\r\n\r\n[1742] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 35, says that they couple\r\nonce only in the year. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 4, says that their\r\nbringing forth continues twelve days.—B.\r\n\r\n[1743] See c. 28 of the present Book. He alludes probably to the lynx.\r\n\r\n[1744] It is not easy to say whence this opinion was derived; the\r\ngeneral character of the wolf is that of quickness and watchfulness,\r\nrather than stupidity.—B. But it would appear that it is the lynx that\r\nis alluded to.\r\n\r\n[1745] The cerastes, or horned serpent, is mentioned by Lucan, in\r\nhis description of serpents, Pharsalia, B. ix. l. 716. One of the\r\nScholiasts on Lucan relates a story that when Helen was eloping with\r\nParis, she trod on the back of a cerastes, and broke it; from which\r\ncircumstance, the whole race moved with a crooked course.\r\n\r\n[1746] Cuvier has observed this animal burying itself in the sand, and\r\nhas seen the motion of its horns, but does not credit its alleged power\r\nof attracting birds; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 412.—B.\r\n\r\n[1747] The amphisbæna is mentioned by Lucan, B. ix. l. 719. “The\r\ndangerous amphisbæna, that moves on at either of its heads.”\r\n\r\n[1748] The account of the two heads is obviously incorrect; the idea\r\nhas risen from the two extremities being nearly of the same size and\r\nappearance. It has been supposed, that there were certain serpents,\r\nwith the power of moving with equal facility in both directions; and\r\nthat the name, Ἀμφίσβαινα, was derived from this circumstance.—B.\r\n\r\n[1749] Lucan mentions the jaculus, B. ix. l. 720, and l. 822. In the\r\nlast passage he says: “Behold! afar, around the trunk of a barren\r\ntree, a fierce serpent—Africa calls it the jaculus—wreathes itself,\r\nand then darts forth, and through the head and pierced temples of\r\nPaulus it takes its flight: nothing does venom there affect, death\r\nseizes him through the wound. It was then understood how slowly fly the\r\nstones which the sling hurls, how sluggishly whizzes the flight of the\r\nScythian arrow.”\r\n\r\n[1750] There is an account of the jaculus, or, as it is called in\r\nGreek, Ἀκοντίας, Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 18; it is mentioned by\r\nGalen, Theriaca, c. 8.—B.\r\n\r\n[1751] In B. ix. l. 701, Lucan says: “Here the gore (of the Gorgon\r\nMedusa) which first from the sand lifted a head, raised the drowsy\r\nasp with its puffed-out neck.” The whole of this passage in Lucan is\r\nwell worth the attention of those desirous to know something of the\r\nserpent-lore of the ancients.\r\n\r\n[1752] Cuvier says, that Geoffroi St. Hilaire has identified this\r\nanimal with the Coluber haje of Linnæus, which has, from the earliest\r\nages, been known as a native of Egypt, and where it still exists. Its\r\ntwo most remarkable characteristics are those here referred to; the\r\npuffing out of the neck when enraged, and its capacity of being tamed,\r\nor, as it is styled, enchanted. This last has been taken advantage\r\nof by the jugglers of that country from the most remote antiquity,\r\nas appears from the writings of Moses, and something of a similar\r\nnature is still practised. They remove the poison fangs, so as to\r\nrender the animal harmless, and by certain sounds render it obedient\r\nto their call. It appears, also, that by pressing on the upper part\r\nof the spine, the animal is rendered paralytic, and may be said to be\r\nchanged into a rod; this fact was witnessed by St. Hilaire. The asp is\r\ndescribed by Aristotle, and is frequently mentioned by Ælian. Galen\r\nspeaks of its deadly poison, in his Theriaca, c. 8. See Ajasson, vol.\r\nvi. pp. 437-9; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 414, 415.—B. Pliny mentions,\r\nhowever, in B. xxiii. c. 27, that the bite of the asp may be cured with\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n[1753] Both Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 29, and Ælian, _ubi\r\nsupra_, speak of the extreme virulence of the poison of the asp, and\r\nCuvier remarks that the haje, and the haga, which are species of the\r\nasp, are among the most formidable of the serpent tribe.—B.\r\n\r\n[1754] The method of attracting this serpent, by imitating the voice of\r\nthe female, proves that there is some foundation for this statement.—B.\r\n\r\n[1755] The ichneumon of the ancients, the “Viverra ichneumon“ of\r\nLinnæus, is still common in Egypt, and renders essential service by\r\ndestroying the eggs of serpents. With respect to what is here said of\r\nits covering its body with mud, to protect itself against the asp, the\r\nfact appears to be, that in searching for the eggs, which are deposited\r\nin the mud, its body becomes more or less covered with that substance,\r\nand may possibly in this way be less exposed to the attacks of the asp.\r\nThe contest of the asp and the ichneumon is mentioned by Ælian, B. iii.\r\nc. 22.—B.\r\n\r\n[1756] Many of the ancients have described the crocodile; of these, the\r\nmost important, for the correctness of the description, are Herodotus,\r\nB. ii. c. 68; Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 10, _et alibi_; and\r\nDiodorus Siculus, B. i.—B.\r\n\r\n[1757] The tongue of the crocodile is flat, and, as afterwards stated,\r\nB. xi. c. 65, adheres to the lower jaw, so as to be incapable of\r\nmotion.—B.\r\n\r\n[1758] This account was first given by Herodotus, _ubi supra_; and,\r\nfrom the form of the head and the neighbouring parts, depicts what\r\nwould naturally occur to the observer; but it is not correct. The\r\nactual state of the parts, and their connection with each other, as\r\nCuvier informs us, were first satisfactorily explained by Geoffroi\r\nSaint Hilaire.—B.\r\n\r\n[1759] Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. v. c. 52, observes, that this is the case\r\nwith the tortoise, and similar animals.—B.\r\n\r\n[1760] Cuvier says, that when it leaves the egg, the young animal is\r\nonly six inches long, and that it ultimately attains a size of from\r\nthirty to forty feet.—B.\r\n\r\n[1761] Herodotus says, that it remains all night in the water, as being\r\nwarmer than the external air. So also Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c.\r\n10.—B.\r\n\r\n[1762] The water of the Nile abounds with small leeches, which attach\r\nto the throat of the crocodile, and, as it has no means of removing\r\nthem, it allows a little bird to enter its mouth for this purpose; this\r\nis described by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6, and by Ælian, Anim.\r\nNat. B. iii. c. 2.—B.\r\n\r\n[1763] Although this account is sanctioned by all the ancient\r\nnaturalists, it is called in question by Cuvier; Ajasson, vol. vi. p.\r\n441; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 421.—B.\r\n\r\n[1764] There is a small lizard, called by the modern naturalists\r\nthe Lacerta scincus; but Cuvier conceives that this cannot be the\r\nanimal here referred to, because it is so very much smaller than the\r\nichneumon, that no one would have thought of comparing them; and, what\r\nseems a better reason, because it is not found in the Nile. From the\r\naccount of the scincus in B. xxviii. c. 30, it is probable that the\r\nanimal here referred to is a species of monitor, popularly called the\r\nland crocodile. Herodotus, B. iv. c. 192, speaks of the land crocodile\r\nas found in Libya; it is also mentioned by Pausanias, Corinthiaca,\r\nc. 20, and by Prosper Alpinus, Ægypt. B. iv. c. 5.—B. The scincus is\r\nprobably the “Lacerta ouaran” of Cuvier.\r\n\r\n[1765] Cuvier remarks, that this account cannot really apply to the\r\ndolphin, because none of the cetacea possess the spines here described.\r\nHe investigates the subject with his usual sagacity, and concludes,\r\nwith much probability, that the animal here referred to was a squalus,\r\nthe Squalus centrina, or spinax of Linnæus; Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 443,\r\n444; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 422, 423. We have an account of the contest\r\nbetween the crocodile and the dolphin in Seneca, Nat. Quæst. B. iv. c.\r\n2.—B.\r\n\r\n[1766] We have some account of the Tentyritæ in Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. x.\r\nc. 21.—B. See B. xxviii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[1767] See B. vii. c. 2. The best description of the Psylli is that\r\ngiven by Lucan in B. ix. l. 892, _et seq._, where he describes the\r\nmarch of Cato’s army across the burning coasts of the Syrtes.\r\n\r\n[1768] This, as Cuvier remarks, is the case with the crocodiles of\r\nNorth America, which, like other reptiles, become torpid during the\r\ncold season; Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 444; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 424.—B.\r\n\r\n[1769] Cuvier remarks, as singular, that the descriptions given by\r\nthe ancients of the hippopotamus should have been incorrect, more\r\nespecially with reference to Herodotus, who had visited Egypt, and who\r\nhas described some of the animals of that country with considerable\r\naccuracy; Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 444, 445; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 425.\r\nPliny has copied the description of Herodotus, B. ii. c. 71, almost\r\nverbatim, and the same has been done by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii.\r\nc. 7. Even the Latin authors, such as Diodorus Siculus and Ælian, who\r\nmight have seen the animal in Rome, continued to transcribe the account\r\nof Herodotus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1770] Herodotus and Aristotle, _ubi supra_, assert, that his hide\r\nis so hard, that spears and other missiles are formed from it; the\r\nstatement of Pliny is, however, much more correct.—B.\r\n\r\n[1771] “Euripo.” See the Notes to c. 7 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1772] Pliny, speaking of the hippopotamus, in B. xxviii. c. 31, styles\r\nit, “the discoverer of the art of letting blood.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1773] Cuvier remarks upon this and the following Chapter, that they\r\nare entirely fabulous. The diseases, remedies, and instructions given\r\nby the animals are equally imaginary, although Pliny has taken the\r\nwhole from authors of credit, and it has been repeated by Plutarch, De\r\nIside, and by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. ii. c. 35, and many others. Ajasson,\r\nvol. vi. p. 446; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 426.—B.\r\n\r\n[1774] Cuvier has given an interesting account of the ibis, the\r\nopinions entertained of it by various travellers and naturalists,\r\nand a detail of the examination which he made of two of its mummies,\r\nwhich were brought by Grobert to Paris, from the wells of Sakhara.\r\nThese mummies were found to be similar to those previously examined by\r\nBuffon, Shaw, and others, and proved the ibis of the ancient Egyptians\r\nto have been a species of curlew. This opinion he further supports\r\nby a reference to various sculptures and mosaics, where this bird is\r\nrepresented, and he remarks upon the errors into which most travellers\r\nand historians have fallen as to it; the only correct account he\r\nconceives to be that of the African traveller, Bruce, who describes and\r\nfigures it under the name of Abou hannès. See the extract in Lemaire,\r\nvol. iii. p. 633, _et seq._, from his _Recherches sur les Ossements\r\nFossiles_, vol. i. p. 141, _et seq._ Herodotus gives an account of the\r\nibis, B. i. c. 75, 76, but it is not correct.—B.\r\n\r\n[1775] The fabulous account of the powers of this herb is referred\r\nto in B. xxv. c. 53, and supported by the highest authorities; among\r\nothers, by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6.; Cicero, De Nat. Deor.\r\nB. ii. c. 50; Virgil, Æn. B. xii. c. 412.—B.\r\n\r\n[1776] See B. xxii. c. 45, for a similar cure. It is not known what\r\nplant is here alluded to, but it has been thought to be the cinara, or\r\nartichoke.\r\n\r\n[1777] The Chelidonium majus of Linnæus. It probably derived its name\r\nfrom the swallow, χελίδων, because its flowers appear at the time that\r\nbird makes its first appearance in the spring. This supposed property\r\nis mentioned by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iii. c. 25. Pliny speaks of its\r\nefficacy in diseases of the eyes, B. xxv. c. 50, and c. 91.—B.\r\n\r\n[1778] Pliny speaks of the medical virtues of cunile bubula, in B. xx.\r\nc. 61; Columella, B. vi. c. 13, says that it is a cure for scabies. It\r\nis not certain what is the plant here referred to; it is considered\r\nidentical with origanum, by Hardouin, and has been supposed by some to\r\nbe marjoram, or pennyroyal. The effect of the cunile on the tortoise\r\nis mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6; by Plutarch, Nat.\r\nQuæst.; Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 12; and by Albertus Magnus, B viii.\r\nTr. ii. c. 2; but there is some difference in their statements. Some\r\nspeak of it as an antidote, enabling the tortoise to counteract the\r\npoison of the serpent, while others regard it as giving the tortoise\r\nincreased vigour to resist the attacks.\r\n\r\n[1779] Aristotle, _ubi supra_, and Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 14,\r\nrefer to this supposed fact, which is without foundation, so far, at\r\nleast, as the contest of the weasels with the serpents and the rue\r\nare concerned. The hostility of the weasel to the mouse is probably\r\ncorrect. Pliny again refers to it, B. xx. c. 51, and it forms the\r\nsubject of one of Phædrus’s Fables, B. iv. c. 2.—B.\r\n\r\n[1780] We have the same account in Plutarch.—B. Plutarch speaks,\r\nhowever, of the _river_ crab.\r\n\r\n[1781] Pliny refers to this effect, B. xx. c. 95; he speaks also\r\nof its application to the eyes of the animal; it is probable, that\r\nfeniculum and marathrum both refer to the same plant; the latter being\r\nthe ordinary Greek, and the former the Latin, name. This effect of the\r\nfeniculum is also mentioned by Ælian, B. ix. c. 16.—B.\r\n\r\n[1782] “Si vero squamæ obtorpuere;” Hardouin supposes that this applies\r\nparticularly to the eyes.—B. There can be little doubt that he is\r\ncorrect in that supposition.\r\n\r\n[1783] Aristotle, _ubi supra_, and Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 4, state\r\nthat the dragon takes the juice of the _picris_ into the stomach, when\r\noverloaded with food. The exact plant referred to, under that name,\r\ncannot be ascertained for certain; but it appears probable, that it is\r\na wild lettuce or endive, or some plant belonging to that family.—B.\r\n\r\n[1784] This effect of aconite, and the antidote for it, are mentioned\r\nin B. xxvii. c. 2; they are also mentioned by Aristotle, _ubi supra_;\r\nand by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 49, and alluded to by Cicero, De.\r\nNat. Deor. B. ii. c. 50. It appears from a statement of Tavernier,\r\nas referred to by Hardouin, that the same antidote against poisoned\r\nweapons is still employed in the island of Java.—B.\r\n\r\n[1785] From the Greek παρδαλιαγχὴς, “pard-strangle.”\r\n\r\n[1786] This is again referred to, B. xxix. c. 39.—B.\r\n\r\n[1787] “Quod persequi immensum est æque scilicet quam reliquam cum\r\nsingulis hominum societatem.” The meaning of this passage is obscure,\r\nand extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\n[1788] This is alluded to by Cicero in his letters to Atticus, and\r\nis mentioned by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 41; B. xi. c. 19; and\r\nVar. Hist. B. i. c. 11.—B. The same is still said of rats, whence our\r\nexpression “to rat,” _i. e._ to desert a falling cause.\r\n\r\n[1789] The priests of this college, or augurs, were among the most\r\nimportant public functionaries in the Roman state, both from the rank\r\nof the individuals and the political power which they derived from\r\ntheir office.—B. The augurs, or diviners by birds, held the highest\r\nrank in the state; but the power of their college greatly declined in\r\nthe later period of the Roman history. It was finally abolished by the\r\nEmperor Theodosius.\r\n\r\n[1790] Other instances are mentioned by Diodorus Siculus, B. iii.\r\nJustin, B. xv. c. 2, and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xvii. c. 41.—B. Showers\r\nof frogs are a thing not unknown in England even. They are probably\r\ncaused by whirlwinds acting upon waters which are the haunt of these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[1791] The ravages of locusts have been known in all ages; their\r\ndestructive effects in Egypt and Judea, have formed the subject of a\r\nvery elaborate dissertation by Bochart, in his work on the “Animals of\r\nScripture,” Part i. B. iv. c. 3 and 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[1792] Used as a place of banishment by the Romans. See B. iv. c. 28,\r\nand c. 82, of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[1793] See c. 82 of the present Book, and B. x. c. 85.—B.\r\n\r\n[1794] The “dog-milkers.” See B. vi. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1795] “Solipugis.” There has been much discussion as to the word here\r\nemployed by Pliny, and the animal which he intends to designate. The\r\nsolipugus, solpugus, solipuga, or solipunga, probably different names\r\nof the same animal, is mentioned by various writers; among others, by\r\nLucan, Phars. B. ix. l. 837; Diodorus Siculus, B. iii.; Strabo, B.\r\nxvi.; and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xvii. c. 40. It is again referred to in\r\nB. xxix. c. 16. The description given is, however, too indefinite to\r\nenable us to identify it with any known animal; it would almost seem to\r\nindicate something between the spider and the ant.—B. We still hear in\r\nmodern times of the venomous and destructive nature of the red ants on\r\nthe coast of Guinea; and it is not improbable that it is to these that\r\nPliny alludes.\r\n\r\n[1796] See B. v. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[1797] This is mentioned by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xv. c. 26.—B. The\r\nscolopendra is one of the multipede insects.\r\n\r\n[1798] Aristotle, De Gener. Anim. B. iii. c. 6, and Hist. Anim. B. vi.\r\nc. 32, accounts for the vulgar error, by stating that the hyæna has\r\na peculiar structure of the parts about the anus, which might, to an\r\nunpractised eye, give the idea, that it possesses the generative organs\r\nof both sexes. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. i. c. 25, and Oppian, Cyneget.\r\nB. iii. c. 289, have adopted this erroneous opinion. What is said\r\nrespecting the hyæna, in the remaining part of this Chapter, is mostly\r\nwithout foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1799] We have had some account given of the mantichora, in c. 30.\r\nThe mantichora and the corocotta are altogether imaginary.—B. Cuvier,\r\nin Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 447; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 439, thinks that\r\nthe stories of the corocotta and the catoblepas, owe their origin to\r\nmutilated accounts of the hyæna, and the animal known to us as the gnu.\r\n\r\n[1800] According to Cuvier, what Pliny here says respecting the herds\r\nof wild asses, and the power of the old males, is correct; but it is\r\ndoubtful whether there is any foundation for what is said about the\r\ncastration of the newly-born animals; Ajasson, _ubi supra_; Lemaire,\r\nvol. iii. p. 440.—B.\r\n\r\n[1801] “De aquaticis et iisdem terrestribus;” although these words are\r\ninserted in the title of this Chapter, the subject is not treated of in\r\nit.—B.\r\n\r\n[1802] Pliny here adopts the vulgar opinion respecting the origin of\r\nthe substance called “castor,” and in B. xxxii. c. 13, gives a more\r\ncorrect description, which he had derived from a physician, named\r\nSextius. It is a fetid, oily substance, secreted by a gland situate\r\nnear the prepuce. Cuvier remarks, that when the gland becomes distended\r\nwith this secretion, the animal may probably get rid of it by rubbing\r\nthe part against a stone or tree, and in this way, leave the castor for\r\nthe hunters, thus giving rise to the vulgar error. Ajasson, vol. vi. p.\r\n448; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 440.—B.\r\n\r\n[1803] The beaver has the most powerful teeth of any animal of the\r\nclass Rodentia, to which it belongs; it uses them for cutting down\r\ntrees, with which it constructs its habitation. Aristotle, Hist. Anim.\r\nB, viii. c. 5, refers to this.—B.\r\n\r\n[1804] The tail is covered with a kind of scale, and is flattened;\r\nbut, in its internal organization, is formed like those of other\r\nquadrupeds.—B.\r\n\r\n[1805] See B. xxxii. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[1806] Pliny, speaking of the different kinds of frogs, B. xxxii. c.\r\n18, says, “There are some which live only in the hedges, and thence\r\nhave the name of rubeta, or bramble frogs.” It seems impossible to\r\nidentify this reptile with any of our known animals: and we may\r\nconclude that there is no foundation for the statement. Ælian gives an\r\naccount of the venomous nature of this animal. Anim. Nat. B. xvii. c.\r\n12.—B.\r\n\r\n[1807] As Cuvier remarks, it is impossible that any animal can\r\ndischarge by vomiting what Pliny terms the “coagulum,” which is the\r\nfourth stomach of a ruminant animal; the same substance which, under\r\nthe name of rennet, is employed to coagulate milk. He conjectures, that\r\nthe error may have originated in the observation, that occasionally\r\nin fish, when suddenly drawn out of the water, the air-bladder is\r\nprotruded from the mouth, which may have been mistaken for the stomach.\r\nThe circumstance is mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 23,\r\nand by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iii. c. 19, as well as the vomiting of the\r\nbile; respecting this latter, we may remark, that vomiting is produced\r\nin various animals, when under the influence of extreme terror.—B.\r\n\r\n[1808] The gecko, according to Littré.\r\n\r\n[1809] This is incorrect; the bite of this animal, wherever found, is\r\nnever fatal.—B.\r\n\r\n[1810] This refers to what will be found stated in this Chapter, that\r\nstags conceal their horns, when they fall off, that they may not be\r\nused in medicine.—B.\r\n\r\n[1811] This is mentioned by Aristotle, Plutarch, and Ælian, but it must\r\nbe considered as very doubtful.—B.\r\n\r\n[1812] See B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[1813] It seems that Pliny here attributes the blackening of the\r\nmouths of the stags to their turning up the earth with their muzzles;\r\nAristotle, however, refers it to a constitutional cause, arising from\r\ntheir violent sexual excitement; Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 29.—B.\r\n\r\n[1814] Or seseli, probably hart-wort. See B. xx. c. 87, and B. xxv. c.\r\n52.\r\n\r\n[1815] We learn from Hardouin, that there has been much discussion\r\nrespecting the plants or other substances which the female is supposed\r\nto eat after parturition. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6, asserts\r\nthat it eats the chorion, the membrane in which the fœtus has been\r\nenveloped, and afterwards the herb seselis. To make the account of\r\nPliny agree with that of Aristotle, some of the commentators have even\r\nsupposed, that _chorion_ here means the name of a plant, and they have\r\nproposed to substitute the word _chorion_ for _aros_ in the text.—B.\r\nAros is probably the present “Arum maculatum,” or wake-robin. See p.\r\n307, N. [1846].\r\n\r\n[1816] Aristotle, Plutarch, and Xenophon speak of the influence of\r\nmusic on these animals.—B.\r\n\r\n[1817] Aristotle, _ubi supra_, mentions this respecting their ears; the\r\nsame takes place, to a certain extent, with all animals that have large\r\nexternal auricles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1818] Aristotle, _ubi supra_, Ælian, _ubi supra_, and B. iii. c. 17,\r\nand Theophrastus, in a fragment on the Envious among Animals, agree in\r\nstating that one of the horns of the stag is never found, although they\r\ndiffer respecting the individual horn, whether the right one or the\r\nleft. Aristotle says that it is the left, while Theophrastus and Ælian\r\nagree with the statement of Pliny.—B.\r\n\r\n[1819] Cuvier says, that no antlers are added after the eighth year.—B.\r\n\r\n[1820] This, as well as most of the statements respecting the growth\r\nof the horns, is mentioned by Aristotle, _ubi supra_, but it is quite\r\nunfounded.—B.\r\n\r\n[1821] This story of the white hind of Sertorius, is given in detail\r\nby Aulus Gellius, B. xv. c. 22, who tells us that it was given to him\r\nby a native of Lusitania, upon which Sertorius pretended that it had\r\nbeen sent from Diana, who, through it, held converse with him, and\r\ninstructed him how to act. Plutarch, Frontinus, and Valerius Maximus,\r\nalso relate the story.\r\n\r\n[1822] This story, which is obviously incorrect, is mentioned by Ælian,\r\nAnim. Nat. B. ii. c. 9; and is again referred to in B. xxviii. c. 42.—B.\r\n\r\n[1823] Graguinus, Hist. Franc. B. ix. c. 3, relates a still more\r\nwonderful anecdote of a similar nature; but, as Buffon remarks, such\r\ntales are without foundation, the life of the stag not being more than\r\nthirty or forty years. Cuvier, also, says that its life does not exceed\r\nthirty-six or forty years.—B.\r\n\r\n[1824] The real nature of the tragelaphus of Pliny, and the\r\nhippelaphus, or horse-stag of Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 1, which\r\nappear to be the same animal, had long remained a disputed question\r\namong naturalists, when, as Cuvier states, the point was decided by\r\nAlphonse Duvaucel, who ascertained that it was a species of stag, which\r\ninhabited the mountains of the north of Hindostan.—B.\r\n\r\n[1825] And in Arabia as well, according to Diodorus Siculus, B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1826] This fact is confirmed by Cuvier, who observes, that it is the\r\nmore remarkable that Africa should be without stags, as it abounds in\r\ngazelles of all forms and colours. He supposes that those travellers,\r\nwho affirm that they have seen stags in this country, had really met\r\nwith gazelles, which they mistook for those animals; Ajasson, vol. vi.\r\np. 451; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 453.—B.\r\n\r\n[1827] Cuvier remarks, that Pliny’s account of the chameleon appears\r\nto be taken from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 11, but that it is\r\nless correct. He notices Aristotle’s account of the eye, which is more\r\naccurately given than the account of Pliny; Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 451,\r\n452; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 454.—B. The chameleon receives its name from\r\nthe Greek χαμαὶ λέων, “the lion on the ground.”\r\n\r\n[1828] See B. xi. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1829] One of those popular errors which have descended from the\r\nancients to our times; the chameleon feeds on insects, which it seizes\r\nby means of its long flexible tongue; the quantity of food which it\r\nrequires appears, however, to be small in proportion to its bulk.—B.\r\n\r\n[1830] “Circa caprificos.” Some commentators would understand this in\r\nreference to the wild fig-tree, and take it to mean that the animal is\r\nmore furious when in its vicinity. The conjecture of Hardouin, however,\r\nseems more reasonable. He takes “caprificos” to mean the same as the\r\n“caprificialis dies,” mentioned in B. xi. c. 15, as being sacred to\r\nVulcan, and falling towards the end of the dog-days.\r\n\r\n[1831] This is another of the erroneous opinions respecting the\r\nchameleon, which has been very generally adopted. It forms the basis of\r\nMerrick’s popular poem of the Chameleon. The animal, indeed, assumes\r\nvarious shades or tints, but the changes depend upon internal or\r\nconstitutional causes, not any external object. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B.\r\nii. c. 14, refers to the change of colour, but does not allude to its\r\ncolour having any connection with that of the object with which it\r\ncomes in contact.—B.\r\n\r\n[1832] The quantity of muscular fibre and blood in the chameleon is no\r\ndoubt small in proportion to the bulk of the animal, although not much\r\nless than in other animals of the same natural order; its spleen is\r\nvery minute, as Cuvier says, not larger than the seed of a lentil.—B.\r\n\r\n[1833] Cuvier remarks, that this account is from the anonymous treatise\r\nDe Mirab. Auscult. p. 1152, and from Theophrastus; and that it was\r\nprobably derived, in the first instance, from the imperfect account\r\nwhich the ancients possessed of the reindeer, the hair of which animal\r\nbecomes nearly white in the winter, and in the summer of a brown or\r\ngrey colour. Bekmann, however, who has written a commentary on the\r\nabove-mentioned treatise, supposes that the tarandrus is the elk.\r\nCuvier conceives, that the animal described by Cæsar, Bell. Gall. B.\r\nvi. c. 26, as inhabiting the Hercynian Forest, which he designates as\r\n“bos cervi figurâ,” is the reindeer; and suggests that “tarandrus” may\r\nhave originated in the German, _das rennthier_. Ajasson, vol. vi. pp.\r\n453, 454; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 456, 457. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. ii. c.\r\n16, speaks of the change of colour in the tarandrus in a way which does\r\nnot correspond with any animal known to exist.—B. Pliny’s stories of\r\nthe tarandrus, thos, and chameleon are ridiculed by Rabelais, B. iv. c.\r\n3.\r\n\r\n[1834] Cuvier supposes that the lycaon of Pliny is the Indian tiger,\r\nwhich has a mane; but what is said of its change of colour is\r\nincorrect.—B.\r\n\r\n[1835] Naturalists have differed respecting the identity of the animal\r\nhere described, but Cuvier conceives, that Bochart has proved it to be\r\nthe canis aureus chakal (jackal) of Linnæus. The description given by\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 17, and B. ix. c. 44, agrees with this\r\nsupposition; it is also described by Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. c. 615.—B.\r\n\r\n[1836] It is possible that the quills of the porcupine may be stuck\r\ninto the skin of the dog so firmly, as to be detached from their\r\nnatural situation; but there is no reason to believe that they can be\r\ndarted out or projected by any exertion of the animal. Ælian, Anim.\r\nNat. B. i. c. 31, and B. xii. c. 26, describes the hystrix; see also\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 30.—B.\r\n\r\n[1837] Cuvier remarks, that this account of the bear is generally\r\ncorrect; he points out, however, certain errors, which will be duly\r\nnoticed. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 3, gives an account of the\r\nparturition of the bear.—B.\r\n\r\n[1838] This description of their mode of coupling, though from\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 30, is not correct. Buffon and other\r\nnaturalists assure us that they do not differ herein from other\r\nquadrupeds.—B.\r\n\r\n[1839] Aristotle says, that the cubs are born blind, without hair, and\r\nthat their limbs are ill formed, which is correct; but the account here\r\ngiven is greatly exaggerated.—B.\r\n\r\n[1840] As the birth takes place when the mother is in her winter\r\nretreat, it can have been witnessed only when in the menagerie.—B.\r\n\r\n[1841] This is referred to in B. xxviii. c. 46; this property of the\r\nfat of the bear is also mentioned by Galen and by Dioscorides, and it\r\nstill retains its place among our popular remedies; but it is difficult\r\nto conceive that it can have any virtue above other fatty substances of\r\nthe same consistence.—B.\r\n\r\n[1842] This, which appears to be a vulgar error, is mentioned by\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 17; by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c.\r\n3; and by Oppian, Halieut. B. ii.—B.\r\n\r\n[1843] We have a somewhat similar account in the treatise De Mirab.\r\nAuscult. p. 1155.—B.\r\n\r\n[1844] Probably from Aristotle, _ubi supra_.—B.\r\n\r\n[1845] This apparent anomaly has been attempted to be explained, by\r\nsupposing that the bears lay up a plentiful store of provisions in\r\ntheir winter retreats, which they consume while they remain without\r\nexercise.—B.\r\n\r\n[1846] Pliny enumerates, at considerable length, the varieties of\r\naros, in B. xxiv. c. 92; it is also described in B. xix. c. 30; it is\r\nprobably a species of arum.—B. See pp. 299, 300, N. [1815].\r\n\r\n[1847] This is, of course, without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1848] This supposed noxious quality is entirely without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1849] This probably refers more particularly to the mode in which the\r\nbear descends from trees or poles, in the supine posture, not, as is\r\nthe case in most other animals, with the head downwards.—B.\r\n\r\n[1850] 18th September.\r\n\r\n[1851] It appears, from the remarks of Cuvier, to be still doubtful\r\nwhether the bear be really a native of Africa; see Ajasson, vol. vi. p.\r\n457; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 466.—B.\r\n\r\n[1852] It is supposed that the white mouse of Pontus, mentioned also\r\nby Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 17, is the ermine, or else the\r\nmarten; but, as Cuvier remarks, Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 457, Lemaire, vol.\r\niii. p. 467, the ermine does not hibernate.—B.\r\n\r\n[1853] Cuvier, _ubi supra_, conceives that the Alpine mouse is the\r\nmarmot; but he remarks, that it is inferior in size to the badger.—B.\r\n\r\n[1854] Cuvier, _ubi supra_, conceives the Egyptian mouse to be the\r\njerboa, the Mus jaculus of Linnæus; but it is much smaller than the\r\nmarmot. Pliny, in B. x. c. 85, says, that the Egyptian mouse walks on\r\ntwo feet, as does the mouse of the Alps. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B.\r\nvii. c. 37, and Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xv. c. 26, refer to the mouse of\r\nEgypt.—B. Probably the Mus cahirinus.\r\n\r\n[1855] The faculty which these and other animals possess of foreseeing\r\nthe weather and the future direction of the wind, is mentioned by\r\nPlutarch, and as existing especially in the hedgehog. It is also\r\nmentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6; but it is not\r\nconfined, as Pliny states, to its change in one direction only. It\r\nhas been suggested by some commentators, that, by a slight alteration\r\nin the text, the statement may be extended to a change of the wind in\r\neither direction, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 468.—B.\r\n\r\n[1856] The teasel, or carding thistle, is now used for this purpose;\r\nas also iron wires, crooked and sharpened at the point. Not a single\r\nquill, probably of the hedgehog, is now used in the manufacture of\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\n[1857] Dalechamps suggests that these complaints were probably to the\r\neffect that thistles and thorns were employed instead of the quills\r\nof the hedgehog; that the skin of the hedgehog was brought to market\r\nin a bad state; and again, that the rich merchants were in the habit\r\nof buying them up, and forestalling the market. Hardouin quotes an\r\nedict of the Emperor Zeno against monopolies of hedgehogs and carding\r\nmaterials, if, indeed, that is the meaning of the word “pectinum.”\r\n\r\n[1858] These statements are from the treatise De Mirab. Ausc., but, as\r\nCuvier remarks, are fabulous, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 470; Ajasson, vol.\r\nvi. p. 458.—B.\r\n\r\n[1859] Λεοντοφονὸς, the “lion-killer.”\r\n\r\n[1860] See c. 30 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1861] This fable is referred to by Ovid, Metam. B. xv. l. 414, and by\r\nTheophrastus in his Treatise on Stones.\r\n\r\n[1862] See B. xxxvii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1863] It is not unusual for animals to cover their excrements with\r\nearth, probably from the fact of their being annoyed by the unpleasant\r\nodour.—B.\r\n\r\n[1864] This statement respecting the “meles,” or badger, as well as\r\nwhat is said of the prescience of the squirrel, is without foundation.\r\nThere has been some difference of opinion respecting the identity of\r\nthe animal, which Pliny calls “meles;” by some it has been supposed to\r\nbe the polecat, or else the weasel.—B.\r\n\r\n[1865] This bears reference to what is said of bears in c. 54, and of\r\nAlpine mice and hedgehogs.\r\n\r\n[1866] This statement is contrary to the account given by Aristotle,\r\nHist. Anim. B. viii. c. 15; he says, that while other serpents conceal\r\nthemselves in holes in the earth, vipers conceal themselves under\r\nrocks.—B.\r\n\r\n[1867] Cuvier remarks, Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 458, Lemaire, vol. iii.\r\np. 473, that nothing is more striking, either to the vulgar or to the\r\nman of science, than the long abstinence from food which serpents are\r\ncapable of enduring.—B.\r\n\r\n[1868] Cavatica.\r\n\r\n[1869] This is the case with the Helix Pomatia, and still more so\r\nwith the Helix Neritoidea, which is very common in the neighbourhood\r\nof Nice, and which, at the approach of winter, is furnished with an\r\noperculum of great thickness.—B.\r\n\r\n[1870] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1871] See B. iv. c. 23. The Romans valued them as a delicate food.\r\n\r\n[1872] This account appears to be principally from Aristotle, Hist.\r\nAnim. B. v. c. 29.—B.\r\n\r\n[1873] According to Cuvier, Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 458, and Lemaire, vol.\r\niii. p. 475, the species of lizard named monitor, frequently exceeds\r\nthis size; but he remarks, in reference to the size of the Indian\r\nlizard, that none of the saurians, except the crocodile, attains the\r\nlength here mentioned.—B.\r\n\r\n[1874] See B. vi. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[1875] See B. v. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1876] See B. v. c. 22, and B. vi. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[1877] This anecdote is referred to by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 25.\r\nHe gives an account of the dog of Gelon, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 62, and\r\nVar. Hist. B. i. c. 13.—B.\r\n\r\n[1878] Tzetzes, Chil. iii. of his History, calls her Ditizela, and thus\r\nalludes to this story: “The said Nicomedes had a dog of very large\r\nsize, and of Molossian breed, which manifested great fidelity to him.\r\nOne day seeing his mistress, the wife of Nicomedes, and the mother of\r\nPrusias, Zielus, and Lysandra, Ditizela, by name, and a Phrygian by\r\nbirth, toying with the king, he took her for an enemy, and rushing on\r\nher, tore her right shoulder.” It is supposed that she died of the\r\ninjuries thus received. Some editions call her Condingis, and others\r\nCosingis.\r\n\r\n[1879] A. Cascellius was an eminent Roman jurist, but nothing seems to\r\nbe known of his preceptor, Volcatius, whose prænomen is thought to have\r\nbeen Mucius. Cascellius was noted for his great eloquence and his stern\r\nrepublican principles; and of Cæsar’s conduct and government he spoke\r\nwith the greatest freedom. He never advanced in civic honours beyond\r\nthe quæstorship, though he was offered the consulship by Augustus;\r\nwhich he declined. He is frequently quoted in the Digest. Horace,\r\nin his Art of Poetry, ll. 371, 372, pays a compliment to the legal\r\nreputation of Cascellius, who is also mentioned by Valerius Maximus and\r\nMacrobius.\r\n\r\n[1880] From Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 10, it appears that his name\r\nwas Cælius Calvus, but probably no further particulars are known of him.\r\n\r\n[1881] He was a distinguished Roman eques, and a friend of Germanicus;\r\nfor which reason he incurred the hatred of Sejanus. To satisfy the\r\nvengeance of Tiberius and his favourite Sejanus, one Latinus Latiaris,\r\na supposed friend of Sabinus, induced him to speak in unguarded terms\r\nof Sejanus and Tiberius, and then betrayed his confidence. He was put\r\nto death in prison.\r\n\r\n[1882] More commonly called the Gradus or Scalæ Gemoniæ, “the stairs of\r\nwailing;” a place down which the bodies of the criminals were thrown,\r\nwhen executed in prison.—B.\r\n\r\n[1883] “Lorum,” the leather thong by which the dogs were held until the\r\nproper moment, when they were “let slip” upon their prey.\r\n\r\n[1884] This is mentioned by Gratian, Cyneget. l. 237.—B.\r\n\r\n[1885] This practice is mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c.\r\n33, and Diodorus Siculus, B. xvii. But Cuvier informs us, that neither\r\nthe tiger nor the panther are capable of generating with the dog; he\r\nsupposes that the account was invented to enhance the value of the\r\nspotted or striped dogs, which were brought from India.—B.\r\n\r\n[1886] The dog is capable of generating with the wolf; and as what is\r\ntermed the shepherd’s dog much resembles the wolf, Cuvier conceives it\r\nnot impossible, that it may have originated from this mixture; Ajasson,\r\nvol. vi. p. 459; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 481.—B.\r\n\r\n[1887] This is mentioned by Ælian, in his Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 53, and\r\nhis Var. Hist. B. i. c. 4. It likewise forms the subject of one of\r\nPhædrus’s Fables.\r\n\r\n[1888] These statements are probably, for the most part, from\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim, B. v. c. 14, and B. vi. c. 20.—B.\r\n\r\n[1889] “Faunos cerni.” Hardouin remarks on these words; “Flitting\r\nbefore the sight, and rushing upon each other, like the Ephialtes,” and\r\nrefers, for a farther explanation, to his commentary on the passage\r\nin B. xxv. c. 10, where the subject is treated more at large. The\r\nEphialtes is generally supposed to have been what we term incubus or\r\nnightmare.—B.\r\n\r\n[1890] All these remedies are perfectly useless.—B.\r\n\r\n[1891] Pliny details the noxious effects, conceived to be produced\r\nby the influence of Sirius, in B. ii. c. 40, and, among others, its\r\ntendency to produce canine madness. In B. xxix. c. 32, he enumerates\r\nthe various remedies proposed for the disease; these, however, are\r\nequally inefficacious with those mentioned here.—B.\r\n\r\n[1892] We have an account of this disease in Celsus, B. v. c. 27, and\r\nespecially of the peculiar symptom from which it derives its classical\r\ndenomination. It is remarkable that Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c.\r\n22, speaking of canine madness, says, that it is communicated by the\r\ndog to all animals, _except man_.—B. See B. vii. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[1893] It appears that there was a difference of opinion as to the\r\nnumber of days during which the Dog-star continued to exercise its\r\ninfluence.—B.\r\n\r\n[1894] The history of this supposed discovery is related more at\r\nlarge, B. xxv. c. 2 and 6. The popular name of the plant is still the\r\n“dog-rose.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1895] Columella says, that the operation prevents the tail from\r\nacquiring “fœdum incrementum,” “a foul increase;” and, as many\r\nshepherds say, secures the animal from the disease.—B.\r\n\r\n[1896] This is one of the marvellous tales related by Julius Obsequens,\r\nc. 103.—B.\r\n\r\n[1897] Plutarch, in his Life of Alexander, gives some account of this\r\ncelebrated horse, and Aulus Gellius, B. v. c. 2, devotes a chapter to\r\nit.—B.\r\n\r\n[1898] Ajasson estimates the price to have been 70,200 francs, £2925\r\nsterling.—B.\r\n\r\n[1899] Situate on the river Hydaspes; Q. Curtius calls it\r\nBucephalus.—B. See B. vi. c. 23, where it is called Bucephala.\r\n\r\n[1900] This account is given by Suetonius, Life of Julius Cæsar, c.\r\n61. Cuvier suggests that the hoofs may have been notched, and that the\r\nsculptor probably exaggerated the peculiarity, so as to produce the\r\nresemblance to a human foot.—B.\r\n\r\n[1901] The nephew of Tiberius and the father of the Emperor Caligula.—B.\r\n\r\n[1902] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xii. c. 40, states that three mares of\r\nMiltiades and Evagoras, which had been victorious in the Olympic games,\r\nwere buried with sepulchral honours in the Ceramicus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1903] Ajasson suggests, with much plausibility, that when connections\r\nof this description are mentioned, the report originated from persons\r\nwho had significant names, as Lebœuf and Poulain; analogous to our\r\nnames of Lamb, Bull, Hog, &c.—B.\r\n\r\n[1904] See B. iii. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[1905] We here find Pliny tripping, for he has previously said, in\r\nB. vii. c. 1, that man is the only animated being that sheds tears.\r\nSee also c. 19 of the present Book, where he represents the lion as\r\nshedding tears.\r\n\r\n[1906] Ælian calls him Centoarates. Antiochus I., or Soter, is here\r\nalluded to. He was killed in battle with the Galli or Galatians, B.C.\r\n261.\r\n\r\n[1907] Mentioned by Cicero, De Divin. B. i. c. 33.—B.\r\n\r\n[1908] Hardouin refers to the works of Busbequius, in which we meet\r\nwith nearly the same account of the sagacity of the horse, as in Pliny;\r\nLemaire, iii. 489.\r\n\r\n[1909] As already mentioned in the Note to c. 54 of the last Book,\r\nthere were four parties or factions of the charioteers who were named\r\nfrom the colour of their dress.\r\n\r\n[1910] The games of the Circus were divided into the Patrician and\r\nthe Plebeian; the first being conducted by generals, consuls, and the\r\ncurule ædiles, the latter by the ædiles of the people.—B.\r\n\r\n[1911] Related somewhat more at large by Plutarch, in his Life of\r\nPublicola.—B.\r\n\r\n[1912] Many of these particulars are from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi.\r\nc. 22.—B.\r\n\r\n[1913] Georgics, B. iii. l. 72, et seq.—B.\r\n\r\n[1914] See Introduction to vol. i. p. vii.\r\n\r\n[1915] Varro, de Re Rust. B. ii. c. 7; and Columella, B. vi. c. 29,\r\nhave treated on this subject at considerable length.—B.\r\n\r\n[1916] The materials of this chapter appear to have been principally\r\ntaken from Aristotle, Varro, and Columella.—B.\r\n\r\n[1917] See B. iv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[1918] Varro, _ubi supra_, gives considerably different directions\r\non this point; he says, “Intercourse is to be allowed, at the proper\r\nseason of the year, twice a day, morning and evening.”\r\n\r\n[1919] This sentence in Columella, _ubi supra_, seems to illustrate\r\nthe meaning, which is somewhat obscure. “Veruntamen nec minus quam\r\nquindecim, nec plures quam viginti, unus debet implere”—“One male ought\r\nto be coupled with not more than twenty females, nor less than fifteen.”\r\n\r\n[1920] Cuvier states, that the hippomanes is a concretion occasionally\r\nfound in the liquor amnii of the mare, and which it devours, from the\r\nsame kind of instinctive feeling which causes quadrupeds generally\r\nto devour the afterbirth. He remarks, however, that this can have no\r\nconnection with the attachment which the mother bears to her offspring;\r\nAjasson, vol. vi. p. 459; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 495. The hippomanes\r\nis said to have been employed by the sorceresses of antiquity, as\r\nan ingredient in their amatory potions. See Aristotle, Hist. Anim.\r\nB. viii. c. 24, and Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xiv. c. 18.—B. See also B.\r\nxxviii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1921] Now Lisbon. See B. iv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1922] The accounts given, by Phœnician navigators, of the fertility\r\nof Lusitania, and the frequency of the mild western breezes, gave rise\r\nto the fable here mentioned, which has been generally received by the\r\nancients; and that not merely by the poets, as Virgil, Geor. B. iii.\r\nl. 274, 275, but by practical writers, as Varro, B. ii. c. 1, and\r\nColumella, B. vi. c. 27. Justin, however, B. xliv. c. 3, attributes\r\nthe opinion to the great size of the horses, and their remarkable\r\nfleetness, from which they were said to be the sons of the wind.—B.\r\n\r\n[1923] The origin and meaning of this name is not known.—B.\r\n\r\n[1924] Martial describes the peculiar short, quick step of the\r\n“asturco,” in one of his Epigrams, B. xiv. Ep. 199.—B.\r\n\r\n[1925] “Alterno crurum explicatu glomeratio;” it would not be possible\r\nto give a literal translation, but we may judge of the meaning by the\r\ncontext.—B. He clearly alludes to a movement like our canter.\r\n\r\n[1926] “Tolutim carpere incursus;” Hardouin explains this by a\r\nreference to Plautus, Asinaria, A. iii. sc. 3, l. 116. “Tolutim ni\r\nbadizas”—“If you do not amble, lifting up your feet.”\r\n\r\n[1927] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 24, gives an account of the\r\ndiseases of horses.—B.\r\n\r\n[1928] “Genere veterino;” so called, according to Hardouin, from\r\n“vectura,” “carriage,” as applicable to horses, asses, and mules;\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 497.—B.\r\n\r\n[1929] There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the exact\r\namount of sums of money mentioned by the ancients. “We read in Varro,\r\nB. ii. c. 1, and B. ii. c. 8, of enormous prices said to have been\r\ngiven for asses, and the particular case of Axius is mentioned, B. iii.\r\nc. 2; according to the usual estimate, the sum here mentioned amounts\r\nto upwards of £3200 sterling.—B.\r\n\r\n[1930] See B. xvii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[1931] Varro, B. i. c. 20, and B. iii. c. 16, and Columella, B. vii.\r\nc. 1, enlarge upon the valuable qualities of the ass for agricultural\r\npurposes; Columella, B. vi. c. 37, treats at length upon the production\r\nof mules.—B.\r\n\r\n[1932] See a passage in Plautus, in which the superior excellence of\r\nthe asses of Arcadia is referred to; Asinaria, A. ii. sc. 2, l. 67.—B.\r\n\r\n[1933] See B. iii. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[1934] This property is mentioned by Herodotus, B. iv. c. 28, and\r\nby Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 27, also De Gener. Anim. B.\r\nii. c. 8, and by Strabo, B. vii. The ass is a native of Arabia, and\r\ndegenerates when brought into a cold climate.—B.\r\n\r\n[1935] These circumstances appear to have been taken from Aristotle,\r\nHist. Anim. B. v. c. 14, and B. vi. c. 23.—B.\r\n\r\n[1936] “Per raritatem eorum translucentibus fluviis.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1937] Upwards of £3200 sterling.—B.\r\n\r\n[1938] An epigram of Martial, B. xiii. Ep. 97, appears to refer to\r\nthe employment of the young ass as an article of food.—B. The famous\r\nsausages of Bologna are made, it is said, of asses’ flesh.\r\n\r\n[1939] The onager, according to Cuvier, is the same with the ass, in\r\nthe wild state; it still exists in large herds in various parts of\r\nSouthern Asia, and is called by the Tartars, Kulan.—B.\r\n\r\n[1940] Most of the circumstances here mentioned appear to have been\r\ntaken from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 24 and 36; Varro, B. ii. c.\r\n8; and Columella, B. vi. c. 37.—B.\r\n\r\n[1941] It is expressly stated by Columella, _ubi supra_, that the mules\r\n“produced from a horse and a female ass, are in all respects most like\r\nthe mother.”\r\n\r\n[1942] This is explained by Columella, _ubi supra_, who remarks,\r\nthat when a stallion is admitted to a female in the full heat of its\r\npassion, it often causes mischief; which is not the case when its\r\nardour has been a little subdued by having been worked for some time.—B.\r\n\r\n[1943] Varro, _ubi supra_, says: “The produce of a mare and a male ass\r\nis a mule, of a horse and a female ass a _hinnus_.”\r\n\r\n[1944] Varro, B. ii. c. 1, alludes to this occurrence; Livy mentions\r\ntwo instances, B. xxvi. c. 23, and B. xxxvii. c. 3; these prodigies\r\nwere said both to have occurred at Reate.—B.\r\n\r\n[1945] Herodotus relates two cases, which were regarded as presaging\r\nsome extraordinary event, B. iii. c. 153, and B. vii. c. 57. Juvenal,\r\nSat. xiii. l. 66, and Suetonius, Life of Galba, c. 4, speak of a\r\npregnant mule as a most extraordinary circumstance; it seems to have\r\ngiven rise to a proverbial expression among the Romans.—B.\r\n\r\n[1946] Cuvier remarks, that there is, in the deserts of Asia,\r\na peculiar animal, with undivided hoofs, the Equus hemionus of\r\nnaturalists, and the Dgiggetai of the Tartars, which bears a\r\nresemblance to our mules, but is not the produce of the horse and the\r\nass; he refers us to Professor Pallas’s account of it in Acad. Petrop.\r\nNov. Com. vol. xix. p. 394; Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 461; Lemaire, vol.\r\niii. p. 505.—B.\r\n\r\n[1947] Pliny repeats this advice in B. xxx. c. 53; it is, of course,\r\nentirely without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1948] The epigram of Martial previously referred to bears this\r\ntitle.—B. See N. [1938], p. 324.\r\n\r\n[1949] This temple was the Parthenon. This anecdote is mentioned by\r\nArist. Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 24; Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 49.—B.\r\n\r\n[1950] In which they probably exposed their samples for sale, as our\r\nfarmers do in small bags. The phrase is ἀπὸ τῶν τηλιῶν, in Aristotle,\r\nHist. Anim. B. vi. c. 24, from whom Pliny takes the story.\r\n\r\n[1951] This alleged superiority is mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim.\r\nB. iii. c. 91, by Varro, B. ii. c. 5, and by Columella, B. vi. c. 1;\r\nbut it is remarked by Dalechamps and Hardouin, that the appellation of\r\nPyrrhic given to these oxen, was more probably derived from their red\r\ncolour, πυῤῥὸς, than from the name of the king. The materials of this\r\nchapter are principally from the above writers, especially Aristotle,\r\nHist. Anim. B. vi. c. 21, and B. viii. c. 7.—B.\r\n\r\n[1952] This singular notion is mentioned by Varro and Columella, _ubi\r\nsupra_; Cuvier says, that it is the origin of the pretended secret\r\nof producing the sexes at pleasure, which was published by Millot;\r\nAjasson, vol. vi. p. 461.—B.\r\n\r\n[1953] 4th January. See B. xviii. c. 64.\r\n\r\n[1954] This is mentioned by Herodotus, B. iv. c. 183; this peculiarity\r\nin their mode of taking their food is ascribed to the extraordinary\r\nlength of the horns; it is also mentioned by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xvi.\r\nc. 33.—B.\r\n\r\n[1955] “Fœdi visu.” This is very similar to the expression used by\r\nVirgil, Georg. B. iii., when describing the points of an ox, l.\r\n52,—“oui turpi caput”—“the head of which is unsightly”— probably in\r\nallusion to its large size.\r\n\r\n[1956] According to Cuvier, there is an ox, in warm climates, which has\r\na mass of fat on the shoulders, and whose horns are only attached to\r\nthe skin; Buffon has described it under the name of Zebu; Ajasson, vol.\r\nvi. p. 461; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 512.—B.\r\n\r\n[1957] “Ad laborer damnantur;” with respect to the colour, Varro, B.\r\nii. c. 5, has the following remarks: “The best colours are black, red,\r\npale red, and white. The latter ones are the most delicate, the first\r\nthe most hardy. Of the two middle ones, the first is the best, and both\r\nare more valuable than the first and last.”\r\n\r\n[1958] We have an account of this process in Columella, B. ii. c. 6.—B.\r\n\r\n[1959] This anecdote is related by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 1.\r\nVirgil, Georg. B. ii. l. 537, speaks of the use of oxen in food, as\r\na proof of the degeneracy of later times, and as not existing during\r\nthe Golden Age; “Ante Impia quad cœsis gens est epulata juvencis.”\r\nThis feeling is alluded to by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xii. c. 34, and by\r\nSuetonius, Life of Domitian, c. ix.—B.\r\n\r\n[1960] It is doubtful whether this is the meaning of “alternos\r\nreplicans orbes,” or what indeed is the meaning. Most editions omit\r\n“orbes,” thus making the matter still worse.\r\n\r\n[1961] Hardouin supposes that this alludes to the exhibition of\r\noxen hunted at the exhibition of shows and in the Circus, for the\r\ngratification of the Roman people.—B.\r\n\r\n[1962] Referred to by Virgil, Georg. B. ii. ll. 145, 146, “et maxima\r\ntaurus Victima,” “and the bull the largest victim of all.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1963] In reference to this remark, we may mention the passage in\r\nVirgil, Æn. B. iii. c. 119, “Taurum Neptuno, taurum tibi, pulcher\r\nApollo.” “A bull to thee, Neptune, a bull to thee, beauteous Apollo.”\r\n\r\n[1964] Instances are mentioned by Livy, B. xxxv. c. 21, and by Val.\r\nMaximus, B. i. c. 65.—B.\r\n\r\n[1965] We have an account of Apis in Herodotus, B. iii. c. 28; also in\r\nPomponius Mela, B. i. c. 9; and in Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xi. c. 10.—B.\r\n\r\n[1966] “Quem cantharum appellant.” According to Dalechamps, “So called\r\nfrom the blackness of the colour, and its resemblance to a beetle.”\r\nLemaire, vol. iii. p. 516. He refers the reader to a further account in\r\nB. xxx. c. 30.—B.\r\n\r\n[1967] From the Greek θάλαμοι, “bed-chambers.”\r\n\r\n[1968] Tacitus, Ann. B. ii. c. 69, gives an account of the sickness\r\nof Germanicus after his return from Egypt, but does not refer to the\r\ncircumstance here mentioned.—B.\r\n\r\n[1969] The “goblet.” See B. v. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1970] Seneca, Quæst. Nat. B. iv. c. 2, gives an account of this\r\nceremony, but does not refer to the birth of Apis.—B.\r\n\r\n[1971] The contents of this Chapter appear to be principally from\r\nVarro, B. ii. cc. 1, 2, and Columella, B. vii. cc. 2, 3, 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[1972] This account is probably from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c.\r\n14; B. vi. c. 19; and B. ix. c. 3, where we have various particulars\r\nrespecting the production and mode of life of the sheep.—B.\r\n\r\n[1973] 13th May.\r\n\r\n[1974] 23rd July.\r\n\r\n[1975] Varro, _ubi supra_, gives a somewhat different account: “Those\r\nlambs are called ‘cordi,’ which are born after their time, and have\r\nremained in the womb, called χορίον, from which they take that name.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1976] The expression “senecta melior,” here employed, is limited by\r\nColumella, _ubi supra_, to the third year.—B.\r\n\r\n[1977] Columella, B. vii. c. 8, remarks, “When deprived of his horns\r\nhe knows himself to be disarmed, as it were, and is not so ready to\r\nquarrel and is less vehement in his passion.”\r\n\r\n[1978] Columella, B. vii. c. 23, refers to this practice; he informs\r\nus, B. vi, c. 28, that it is practised with respect to the horse. It is\r\nalso referred to by Aristotle, De Gen. Anim. B. iv. c. 1.—B.\r\n\r\n[1979] For this we have the authority of Aristotle, _ubi supra_, and of\r\nColumella, _ubi supra_, who quotes from Virgil in support of it, Geor.\r\nB. iii. l. 387, _et seq._—B. “Although the ram be white himself, if\r\nthere is a black tongue beneath the palate, reject him, that he may not\r\ntinge the fleece of the young with black spots.”\r\n\r\n[1980] Varro, B. ii. c. 2, remarks, “While the coupling is taking\r\nplace, you must use the same water; for if it is changed, it will\r\nrender the wool spotted, and injure the womb.”\r\n\r\n[1981] “Tectæ.” The context shows that this means covered with skins or\r\na woollen girth, probably on account of their delicate nature, while\r\nthe common sheep of husbandry, or the “colonic” sheep, were able to\r\nendure the rigour of the weather without any such protection.\r\n\r\n[1982] The words are _tectum_ and _colonicum_; Columella, B. vii. c.\r\n4, uses the terms _molle_ and _hirsutum_, and Varro, B. ii. c. 2,\r\n_pellitum_ and _hirtum_. The first obtained its name from its being\r\ncovered with skins, to protect its delicate fleece. The colonic is so\r\ncalled, from “colonus,” a “husbandman,” this kind being so common as to\r\nbe found in any village; whereas the tectæ were rare.\r\n\r\n[1983] We have some account of the Arabian sheep in Ælian, Anim. Nat.\r\nB. x. c. 4.—B. Columella says, that the wool which was brought over to\r\nmake these coverings, was only to be obtained at a very great price.\r\n\r\n[1984] The greatest part of this Chapter appears to be taken, with\r\nlittle variation, from Columella, B. vii. c. 2-4.—B.\r\n\r\n[1985] Here Pliny differs from Columella, who remarks, B. vii. c. 2,\r\n“Our people considered the Milesian, Calabrian, and Apulian wool as of\r\nexcellent quality, and the Tarentine the best of all.”\r\n\r\n[1986] “Pænula” was a check cloak, used chiefly by the Romans when\r\ntravelling, instead of the toga, as a protection against the cold and\r\nrain. It was used by women as well as men. It was long, and without\r\nsleeves, and with only an opening for the head. Women were forbidden by\r\nAlexander Severus to wear it in the city. It was made particularly of\r\nthe woolly substance known as gausapa.\r\n\r\n[1987] The wool of Laodicea is celebrated by Strabo, B. xii.—B.\r\n\r\n[1988] Columella, B. vii. c. 2, particularly notices the excellence of\r\nthe wool of Altinum, situate near the mouth of the Padus or Po. The\r\nfollowing epigram of Martial, B. xiv. c. 155, may be presumed to convey\r\nthe opinion of the respective merits of the different kinds of wool;\r\nit is entitled “Lanæ albæ:” “Velleribus primis Apulia; Parma secundis\r\nNobilis; Altinum tertia laudat ovis.” “Apulia is famed for its fleeces\r\nof the first quality, Parma for the second, while Altinum is praised\r\nfor those of the third.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1989] About twelve shillings sterling.—B.\r\n\r\n[1990] Varro remarks, B. ii. c. 2, that the term “vellus,” obviously\r\nfrom “vello,” “to pluck,” proves that the wool was anciently plucked\r\nfrom the sheep, before shearing had been invented.—B.\r\n\r\n[1991] “Quas nativas appellant.” The term “nativa,” as applied to\r\nthe wool, has been supposed to refer to those fleeces that possess a\r\nnatural colour, and do not require to be dyed.—B.\r\n\r\n[1992] Martial, B. xiv. Ep. 157, calls the fleeces of Pollentia\r\n“lugentes,” “mournful,” from their black colour; they are also\r\nmentioned by Columella, _ubi supra_, and by Silius Italicus, B. viii.\r\nl. 599.—B.\r\n\r\n[1993] Martial, B. v. c. 37, describing the charms of a lady, says,\r\n“surpassing with her locks the fleece of the Bætic sheep,” no doubt\r\nreferring to the colour. In another Epigram, B. xii. E. 200, he speaks\r\nof the “aurea vellera,” the “golden fleece” of Bætis.—B.\r\n\r\n[1994] Martial has two Epigrams on the wool of Canusium, B. xiv. E.\r\n127, and E. 129. In the former it is designated as “fusca,” tawny; in\r\nthe latter, “rufa,” red.—B.\r\n\r\n[1995] “Suæ pulliginis.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1996] The term here used, “succidus,” is explained by Varro, B. ii.\r\nc. 11: “While the newly-clipped wool has the sweat in it, it is called\r\n‘succida.’” See B. xxix. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1997] “Pexis vestibus.” According to Hardouin, the “pexa vestis,”\r\nwas worn by the rich, and had a long and prominent nap, in\r\ncontradistinction to the smooth or worn cloths. He refers to a passage\r\nin Horace, B. i. Ep. i. l. 95, and to one in Martial, B. ii. E. 58,\r\nwhich appear to sanction this explanation. See Lem. vol. iii. p. 524.—B.\r\n\r\n[1998] See B. iv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1999] See B. iii. c. 5. Now Pezenas.\r\n\r\n[2000]\r\n\r\n  Καὶ ῥήγεα καλὰ\r\n  Πορφύρ’ ἐμβαλέειν, στορέσαι δ’ ἐφύπερθε τάπητας.\r\n\r\nOd. B. iv. l. 427. “And to throw on fair coverlets of purple, and to\r\nlay carpets upon them.”\r\n\r\n[2001] These were probably much like what we call “Turkey” carpets.\r\n\r\n[2002] The name given to this article, “lana coacta,” “compressed\r\nwool,” correctly designates its texture. The manufacturers of it were\r\ncalled “lanarii coactores,” and “lanarii coactiliarii.”\r\n\r\n[2003] “I have macerated unbleached flax in vinegar saturated with\r\nsalt, and after compression have obtained a felt, with a power of\r\nresistance quite comparable with that of the famous armour of Conrad of\r\nMontferrat; seeing that neither the point of a sword, nor even balls\r\ndischarged from fire-arms, were able to penetrate it.” _Memoir on the\r\nsubstance called Pilina, by Papadopoulo-Vretos, on the Mem. presented\r\nto the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres_, 1845, as\r\nquoted by Littré.\r\n\r\n[2004] Pliny probably conceived that by the removal of all the grease\r\nfrom the wool, or the “purgamentum,” it became less combustible.—B.\r\n\r\n[2005] “Tomentum;” an Epigram of Martial, B. xiv. E. 160, explains the\r\nmeaning of this word.—B.\r\n\r\n[2006] See B. xix. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2007] Probably in the form of what we call “palliasses.”\r\n\r\n[2008] The “gausapa,” or “gausapum,” was a kind of thick cloth, very\r\nwoolly on one side, and used especially for covering tables, beds, and\r\nmaking cloaks to keep out the wet and cold. The wealthier Romans had it\r\nmade of the finest wool, and mostly of a purple colour. It seems also\r\nto have been sometimes made of linen, but still with a rough surface.\r\n\r\n[2009] From ἀμφίμαλλα, “napped on both sides.” They probably resembled\r\nour baizes or druggets, or perhaps the modern blanket.\r\n\r\n[2010] Pliny again makes mention of the “ventrale,” or apron, in B.\r\nxxvii. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[2011] He seems to allude here to the _substance_ of which the\r\nlaticlave tunic was made, and not any alteration in its cut or shape.\r\nSome further information on the laticlave or broad-striped tunic will\r\nbe found in B. x. c. 63.\r\n\r\n[2012] About the time of Augustus, the Romans began to exchange the\r\n“toga,” which had previously been their ordinary garment, for the more\r\nconvenient “lacerna” and “pænula,” which were less encumbered with\r\nfolds, and better adapted for the usual occupations of life.—B.\r\n\r\n[2013] See B. ix. c. 62.\r\n\r\n[2014] See B. xxi. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[2015] This deity was also called Sangus, or Semo Sancus; and Ovid,\r\nFasti, B. vi. c. 216, _et seq._, gives us much information concerning\r\nhim. He was of Sabine origin, and identical with Hercules and Dius\r\nFidius. If we may judge from the derivation of the name, it is not\r\nimprobable that he presided over the sanctity of oaths. His temple at\r\nRome was on the Quirinal, opposite to that of Quirinus, and near the\r\ngate which from him derived the name of “Sanqualis porta.” He was said\r\nto have been the father of the Sabine hero Sabus.\r\n\r\n[2016] According to the commonly received account, Tanaquil was the\r\nwife of Tarquinius Priscus, and a native of Etruria; when she removed\r\nto Rome, and her husband became king, her name was changed to Caia\r\nCæcilia.—B.\r\n\r\n[2017] “Undulata;” it has been suggested that this means the same as\r\nour stuffs which we term “watered.”—B.\r\n\r\n[2018] “Tunica recta;” according to Festus, it was “so called from\r\nbeing woven perpendicularly by people standing.”—B. It probably means\r\nwoven from top to bottom and cross-wise in straight lines.\r\n\r\n[2019] “Toga pura;” so called from being white, without a mixture of\r\nany other colour.\r\n\r\n[2020] “Sororiculata;” there is much uncertainty respecting the\r\nderivation of this word and its meaning, but it is generally supposed\r\nto signify some kind of stuff, composed of a mixture of different\r\ningredients or of different colours.—B. “Orbiculata,” “with round\r\nspots,” is one reading, and probably the correct one.\r\n\r\n[2021] According to Hardouin, these were cloths which imitated the\r\ncrisp and prominent hair of the Phryxian fleece, Lemaire, vol. iii. p.\r\n529. Some editions read “Phrygianas.”\r\n\r\n[2022] “Papaverata;” there is considerable difficulty in ascertaining\r\nthe meaning of this word, as applied to garments. Pliny, in two other\r\npassages, speaks of a certain species of poppy—“from this, linens\r\nreceive a peculiar whiteness,” B. xix. “From this, linens receive a\r\nbrilliant whiteness in time,” B. xx. c. 78. It would appear, in these\r\ncases, that the fibres of the stem of the poppy were mixed with the\r\nflax; though, perhaps, this would be scarcely practicable with wool.—B.\r\n\r\n[2023] The prætexta is described by Varro as a white toga, with a\r\npurple band; it was worn by males, until their seventeenth year, and by\r\nyoung women until their marriage.—B.\r\n\r\n[2024] The trabea differed from the prætexta, in being ornamented with\r\nstripes (trabes) of purple, whence its name.—B.\r\n\r\n[2025] Helen is introduced, Il. B. iii. l. 125, weaving an embroidered\r\ngarment, in which were figured the battles of the Greeks and Trojans.\r\nIt was probably somewhat of the nature of modern tapestry.—B.\r\n\r\n[2026] See B. ix. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[2027] This passage, in which the needle is said to have been used,\r\nproves that when the word “pictæ” is applied to garments, it is\r\nequivalent to our term “embroidered.”—B.\r\n\r\n[2028] Pliny refers to the “Attalica tunica,” B. xxxiii. c. 29, and to\r\nthe “Attalica vestis,” B. xxxvi. c. 20, and B. xxxvii. c. 6; Propertius\r\nspeaks of “Attalica aulæa,” B. ii. c. 32, l. 12, “Attalicas torus,” B.\r\nii. c. 13, l. 22, and B. iv. c. 5, l. 24, and “Attalicæ vestes,” B.\r\niii. c. 18, l. 19.—B.\r\n\r\n[2029] Plautus, Stich. A. ii. s. 2, l. 54, speaks of “Babylonica\r\nperistromata, consuta tapetia,” “Babylonian hangings, and embroidered\r\ntapestry;” and Martial, B. viii. Ep. 28, l. 17, 18, of “Babylonica\r\ntexta,” “Babylonian textures.”—B.\r\n\r\n[2030] From Martial’s epigram, entitled “Cubicularia polymita,” B.\r\nxiv. Ep. 150, we may conclude that the Egyptian polymita were formed\r\nin a loom, and of the nature of tapestry, while the Babylonian were\r\nembroidered with the needle. Plautus probably refers to the Egyptian\r\ntapestry, in the Pseud. A. i. s. 2, l. 14, “Neque Alexandrina belluata\r\nconchyliata tapetia”—“Nor yet the Alexandrine tapestries, figured over\r\nwith beasts and shells.”\r\n\r\n[2031] “Scutulis divider.” This term may mean “squares,” “diamonds,” or\r\n“lozenges,” something like the segments into which a spider’s web is\r\ndivided. It is not improbable that he alludes here to the plaids of the\r\nGallic nations.\r\n\r\n[2032] We have an account of this contention in Plutarch, and we may\r\npresume that this accusation was produced at that time.—B.\r\n\r\n[2033] The first sum amounts to about £4,600 sterling, the latter to\r\n£23,000.—B.\r\n\r\n[2034] The following lines in Ovid, Fasti, B. vi. l. 569, _et seq._,\r\nhave been supposed to refer to this temple, and prove that the account\r\nof it is correct.\r\n\r\n  “Lux eadem, Fortuna, tuaque est, auctorque, locusque.\r\n  “Sed superinjectis quis latet æde togis?\r\n  “Servius est....”\r\n\r\n“The same day is thine, O Fortune; the same the builder, the same the\r\nsite. But who is this that lies hid beneath the garments covering him?\r\nIt is Servius.”\r\n\r\n[2035] Perhaps “changed their colour” may be a better translation of\r\n“defluxisse.”\r\n\r\n[2036] “Sesquipedalibus libris.” It seems impossible to translate this\r\nliterally. Hardouin explains it by supposing that the fleeces were dyed\r\nin strips of three colours, each strip being half a foot in breadth,\r\nand that three of these required a pound of the dyeing materials.—B.\r\n\r\n[2037] Pliny probably took this from Varro, B. ii. c. 2. This term is\r\nderived from πείκω, “to shear,” with the negative prefix.—B.\r\n\r\n[2038] The word “cubitales” alone is used, which might be supposed to\r\nrefer only to the length of the tail; but Hardouin conceives that it\r\nmust also apply to the breadth, and refers to Aristotle, Hist. Anim.\r\nB. viii. c. 28, and others, in proof of the great size which the tails\r\nof the Syrian sheep attain, and which would not be indicated by merely\r\nsaying that they are a cubit long; this being little more than the\r\nordinary length in other countries.—B.\r\n\r\n[2039] According to Hardouin, this term, or some word nearly resembling\r\nit, was applied to mules or mongrels, as well as to individual animals\r\nof diminutive size or less perfect form.—B. Called “moufflon” by the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n[2040] The term “umbri” appears to have been applied to a mongrel or\r\nless perfect animal; like “musmon,” it is of uncertain derivation.—B.\r\n\r\n[2041] So also Varro, _ubi supra_, and Columella, B. vii. c. 3.—B. See\r\nalso B. xviii. c. 76.\r\n\r\n[2042] This remark, and the others in the remainder of this Chapter,\r\nappear to be taken from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 3.—B.\r\n\r\n[2043] We have an account of the generation of the goat in Aristotle,\r\nHist. Anim. B. vi. c. 19. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iii. c. 38, says that\r\nthe goats of Egypt sometimes produce five young ones at a birth.—B.\r\n\r\n[2044] Columella, B. vii. c. 6, gives a somewhat different account; he\r\nsays, “Before its sixth year it is old—so that when five years old, it\r\nis not suitable for coupling.”—B.\r\n\r\n[2045] According to Columella, _ubi supra_, “Because those with horns\r\nare usually troublesome, from their uncertainty of temper.”—B.\r\n\r\n[2046] There has been considerable difference of opinion respecting\r\nthe reading of the original, whether the word “utiles,” or “inutiles,”\r\nwas the one here employed. Hardouin conceives it was the latter, and\r\nendeavours to reconcile the sense with this reading; Lemaire, vol. iii.\r\npp. 538, 539. But, notwithstanding his high authority, there is still\r\ngreat doubt on the matter.—B.\r\n\r\n[2047] “Infractis,” probably in contradistinction to erect ears.\r\nColumella, _ubi supra_, terms them, “flaccidis et prægrandibus\r\nauribus”—“flaccid ears, and very large.”—B.\r\n\r\n[2048] “Laciniæ;” Varro, B. ii. c. 3, describes them as “mammulas\r\npensiles;” Columella, _ubi supra_, calls them “verruculas;” he,\r\nhowever, assigns this appendage to the male goat.—B.\r\n\r\n[2049] The word “mutilus” is employed, which Hardouin interprets,\r\n“having had the horns removed.” But the same word is applied by\r\nColumella, B. vii. c. 6, to an animal naturally without horns.—B.\r\n\r\n[2050] On this reference to Archelaus, Dalechamps remarks that he is\r\nincorrect; but refers to Varro, _ubi supra_, who ascribes this opinion\r\nto Archelaus; Lemaire. vol. iii. p. 540.—B.\r\n\r\n[2051] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 9, refers to this opinion, as\r\nbeing erroneous; Ælian. Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 53, supposes that they\r\nbreathe both through the nose and the ears.—B.\r\n\r\n[2052] Varro, _ubi supra_, remarks, “that no one in his senses speaks\r\nof a goat in health; for they are never without fever.”\r\n\r\n[2053] Meaning those who cannot see at night, who have a weak sight,\r\nand therefore require a strong light to distinguish objects. See also,\r\nas to the Nyctalopes, B. xxviii. c. 47. The same remedy, the liver of\r\nthe goat, is recommended for its cure.—B. See also B. xxviii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2054] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 28, says that the inhabitants\r\nof Cilicia shear the goats in the same manner as the sheep.—B.\r\n\r\n[2055] This is mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 3.—B.\r\n\r\n[2056] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 3, refers to the beard of the\r\ngoat, under the name of ἤρυγγον.\r\n\r\n[2057] According to Hardouin, the herb referred to is the “eryngium;”\r\nprobably the “eringo:” he cites various authorities in support of his\r\nopinion.—B.\r\n\r\n[2058] This is repeated in B. xvii. c. 24.—B.\r\n\r\n[2059] Varro, B. i. c. 2, says: “Hence it is that they sacrificed no\r\ngoats to Minerva, on account of the olive;” he then explains why the\r\ncircumstance of the goat injuring the olive-tree was a reason for not\r\noffering it in sacrifice to Minerva, the patroness of this tree. Ovid,\r\non the other hand, in the Fasti, B. i. l. 360, says that the goat was\r\nsacrificed to Bacchus, _because_ it gnawed the vine.\r\n\r\n[2060] We have an account of the hog in Varro, B. ii. c. 4, from whom\r\nmost of Pliny’s remarks are probably derived.—B.\r\n\r\n[2061] Varro, B. ii. c. 4, and Columella, B. vii. c. 9. fix upon the\r\nseventh year.—B.\r\n\r\n[2062] Varro, and Columella, _ubi supra_, recommend that the sow should\r\nnot be allowed to rear more than eight young ones at each birth.—B.\r\n\r\n[2063] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 13.—B.\r\n\r\n[2064] Varro, _ubi supra_, says on the tenth day; Hardouin endeavours\r\nto prove that the number in Varro was originally five.—B.\r\n\r\n[2065] The term “bidens,” employed by Pliny, although it literally\r\nmeans “having two teeth,” has been referred to the age of the animal,\r\nas indicated rather by the respective size of the teeth than by their\r\nnumber. It has been supposed to designate an animal of two years old,\r\nwhen the canine teeth of the lower jaw had become prominent.—B.\r\n\r\n[2066] This is also referred to by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 18,\r\nbut is without foundation.—B.\r\n\r\n[2067] Aristotle, _ubi supra_, B. viii. c. 26. It is mentioned as a\r\nfrequent occurrence by Plautus, Trinum. A. ii. s. 4, l. 139.—B.\r\n\r\n[2068] Columella, B. vii. c. 10, gives directions for the treatment of\r\nhogs affected with scrofula. The name of the disease has been supposed\r\nto be derived from the frequency of its occurrence in this animal,\r\nanciently called “scrofa.”\r\n\r\n[2069] It may appear unnecessary to refer to authorities on this\r\nsubject, which is a matter of daily observation; it has, however, been\r\nstated by some naturalists, that the hog, in its wild state, does not\r\nexhibit any of the filthy propensities so generally observed in it when\r\ndomesticated.—B.\r\n\r\n[2070] This saying is found in Varro, B. ii. c. 4; it is referred to\r\nby Cicero, De Nat. Deor. B. ii. c. 64, and ascribed to Chrysippus; “ne\r\nputisceret, animam ipsam pro sale datam.”—B. “That they are only of use\r\nfor their flesh, which is kept from putridity by their life, which acts\r\nas salt.”\r\n\r\n[2071] Pliny speaks of this more at large in B. xxviii. c. 60.—B.\r\n\r\n[2072] This operation, and the effect of it, are mentioned by\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 79, and by Columella, B. vii. c. 9.—B.\r\n\r\n[2073] There were three Romans of this name, celebrated for their skill\r\nin gastronomy; of these the most illustrious lived in the reigns of\r\nAugustus and Tiberius. A treatise (probably spurious) is extant, to\r\nwhich his name is attached, entitled “De Arte Culinariâ”—“On the Art of\r\nCookery.” Pliny refers to him again, B. xix. c. 41, and he is mentioned\r\nby many others of the classical writers.—B.\r\n\r\n[2074] See B. x. c. 1. A much more cruel mode of increasing the liver\r\nof this animal, by confining it in hot ovens, is practised at the\r\npresent day, to satisfy the palate of the admirers of the Strasburg\r\n_patés de foies gras_.\r\n\r\n[2075] Pliny, in B. ix. c. 66, employs the expression “tonsillæ in\r\nhomine, in sue glandulæ,” as if he considered them analogous parts.—B.\r\nSee Plautus _passim_.\r\n\r\n[2076] Publius Syrus was a comic performer and a writer, who acquired\r\nconsiderable celebrity; he lived during the reign of Augustus.—B.\r\n\r\n[2077] “Aprugnum callum;” Plautus, in detailing the preparations for a\r\nfeast, enumerates the following articles, “pernam, callum, glandium,\r\nsumen;” Pseudolus, A. i. s. 2, l. 32; all of which are parts of the hog.\r\n\r\n[2078] “Ponebatur.” Littré and Ajasson render this, “placed at table.”\r\nIt would appear, however, that the meaning is that this part was put by\r\nfor salting, and the other parts were served at table while fresh.\r\n\r\n[2079] “Vivaria;” Varro, B. iii. c. 12, and Aulus Gellius, B. ii. c.\r\n20, give an account of the different places which were employed by\r\nthe Romans for preserving animals of various descriptions, with their\r\nappropriate designations. Varro names the inventor Fulvius Lippinus.—B.\r\n\r\n[2080] Varro, B. iii. c. 13, gives an animated description of a visit\r\nto what he calls the leporarium of Hortensius, where, besides hares,\r\nas the name implies, there was a multitude of stags, boars, and other\r\nfour-footed animals.\r\n\r\n[2081] Ælian, De Anim. Nat. B. xvi. c. 37, says, that no boar, either\r\nwild or tame, is produced in India, and that the Indians never use the\r\nflesh of this animal, as they would regard the use of it with as much\r\nhorror as of human flesh.—B. The “Sus babiroussa” is probably meant by\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\n[2082] There has been some difference of opinion respecting the\r\nderivation of this word, but it is generally used to express a\r\n“mongrel,” _i. e._ an animal whose parents are of different natures,\r\nor, when applied to the human species, of different countries.—B.\r\n\r\n[2083] See B. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2084] It is not easy to determine what animals Pliny intended\r\nto designate. Cuvier employs the terms “chevreuils, chamois, and\r\nbouquetins,” as the corresponding words in the French. In English we\r\nhave no names to express these varieties; we may, however, regard them\r\ngenerally, as different species of wild goats. Cuvier conceives that\r\nthe Linnæan names of the animals mentioned were, probably, Cervus\r\ncapreolus, Antelope rupicapra, and Capra ibex.—B.\r\n\r\n[2085] The resemblance may be supposed to consist in the horns being\r\nhollow, and tapering to a point.—B.\r\n\r\n[2086] There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the correct\r\nreading, or the exact meaning which the writer intended to convey by\r\nthe words employed.—B.\r\n\r\n[2087] There is some difficulty in determining the nature of the\r\nvariety which Pliny terms “oryges;” Hardouin has collected the opinions\r\nof naturalists, and we have some remarks by Cuvier; he refers to\r\nBuffon’s account of the Antelope oryx, as agreeing, in the essential\r\npoints, with the description given by Pliny; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 554.\r\nSee B. xi. c. 106.\r\n\r\n[2088] Cuvier remarks, that there is some doubt respecting the dama of\r\nPliny; he is, however, disposed to regard it as a species of antelope.\r\nAjasson, vol. vi. p. 464, 465; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 554.—B.\r\n\r\n[2089] The term pygargus is derived from the words πυγὴ ἀργὸς, denoting\r\n“white buttocks.” Probably a kind of gazelle.\r\n\r\n[2090] “With twisted horns.” It is probable that Pliny intended to\r\ndesignate a species of antelope.—B. See B. xi. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[2091] In this division Pliny, probably, included what he has termed\r\nthe “capræa,” the rupicapra, and the ibex.—B.\r\n\r\n[2092] Some of these animals are entirely without a tail, and this\r\ncircumstance has been employed to form the primary division of the\r\nsimiæ into the two species, those with and those without tails. We have\r\nan epigram of Martial, in which this is referred to. “Si mihi cauda\r\nforet, cercopithecus eram”—“If I had but a tail, I should be a monkey.”\r\nB. iv. Ep. 102.—B. See B. xi. c. 100.\r\n\r\n[2093] We learn from Strabo, Ind. Hist. B. xv., that, in catching the\r\nmonkey, the hunters took advantage of the propensity of these animals\r\nto imitate any action they see performed. “Two modes,” he says, “are\r\nemployed in taking this animal, as by nature it is taught to imitate\r\nevery action, and to take to flight by climbing up trees. The hunters,\r\nwhen they see an ape sitting on a tree, place within sight of it a\r\ndish full of water, with which they rub their eyes; and then, slyly\r\nsubstituting another in its place, full of bird-lime, retire and keep\r\nupon the watch. The animal comes down from the tree, and rubs its\r\neyes with the bird-lime, in consequence of which the eyelids stick\r\ntogether, and it is unable to escape.” Ælian also says, Hist. Anim.\r\nB. xvii. c. 25, that the hunters pretend to put on their shoes, and\r\nthen substitute, in their place, shoes of lead; the animal attempts to\r\nimitate them, and, the shoes being so contrived, when it has once got\r\nthem on, it finds itself unable to take them off, or to move, and is\r\nconsequently taken.\r\n\r\n[2094] There has been some difficulty in ascertaining the exact\r\nreading here; but the meaning seems to be, that the pieces were made\r\nof wax, and that the animals had learned to distinguish them from each\r\nother, and move them in the appropriate manner; how far this is to be\r\ncredited, it is not easy to decide, but it would certainly require very\r\nstrong and direct evidence. We are told that the Emperor Charles V. had\r\na monkey that played at chess with him.—B.\r\n\r\n[2095] In the original, termed “cynocephali,” “dog’s-headed;” an\r\nappellation given to them, according to Cuvier, from their muzzle\r\nprojecting like that of a dog; we have an account of this species in\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 13.—B. Probably the baboon. See B. vi.\r\nc. 35, and B. vii. c. 2. The satyr is, perhaps, the uran-utang. See B.\r\nv. c. 8, and B. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2096] Or “fine-haired monkey;” supposed to be the Silenus of Linnæus;\r\nit is described by Buffon, under the name of Callitrix.—B. It seems to\r\nbe also called the “Simia hamadryas.”\r\n\r\n[2097] Hardouin gives references to the authors who have observed\r\nthis change in the colour of the hare, apparently depending upon the\r\npeculiar locality, and its consequent exposure to a low temperature.\r\nCuvier considers it as characteristic of a peculiar species, the Lepus\r\nvariabilis, “which being peculiar to the highest mountains, and the\r\nregions of the north, is white in winter.”—B.\r\n\r\n[2098] Or coney, “cuniculus.” Hardouin makes some observations upon the\r\nderivation of this term, to show that Pliny was mistaken in supposing\r\nit to be of Spanish origin; we have also an observation of Cuvier’s to\r\nthe same effect.—B.\r\n\r\n[2099] “Laurices;” we have no explanation of this word in any of the\r\neditions of Pliny. Its origin appears to be quite unknown.\r\n\r\n[2100] According to Cuvier, the Mustela furo of Linnæus. Ajasson, _ubi\r\nsupra_.—B.\r\n\r\n[2101] Because, as Varro says, De Re Rus. B. iii. c. 12, they are in\r\nthe habit of making burrows—cuniculos—in the earth.\r\n\r\n[2102] This reference to the opinion of Archelaus appears to be from\r\nVarro, _ubi supra_; the same reference is made by Ælian, Hist. Anim. B.\r\nii. c. 2.—B.\r\n\r\n[2103] Respecting the dasypus of Pliny, it has been doubted whether it\r\nbe a distinct species, a variety of the hare, or merely a synonyme.—B.\r\n\r\n[2104] It is by some contended, that the human female, and perhaps some\r\nother animals, have occasionally been the subjects of what is termed\r\nsuperfœtation; whereas, according to Pliny, in the hare and the dasypus\r\nit takes place frequently, but in no other animals.—B. On this subject,\r\nsee B. vii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2105] This is referred to by Cicero, in his treatise, De Divinatione,\r\nB. i. c. 44, and B. ii. c. 27; in the latter he treats it as an idle\r\ntale.—B.\r\n\r\n[2106] See B. iii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2107] C. Papirius Carbo, a contemporary and friend of the Gracchi. In\r\nB.C. 119, the orator, Licinius Crassus, brought a charge against him,\r\nthe nature of which is not known; but Carbo put an end to his life, by\r\ntaking cantharides.\r\n\r\n[2108] These different species are thus characterized by Cuvier:\r\n“Les premiers sont les souris et les rats, de formes ordinaires; les\r\nseconds, les grandes musaraignes [shrew-mice] de la taille du rat,\r\ntelles que l’on en trouve en Egypte; les troisiemes, une espece de\r\nsouris particuliere à l’Egypte, et peut-être à la Barbarie, armée\r\nd’epines parmi ses poils dont Aristote avait deja parlé (B. vi. l. 37,\r\n_cap. ult._) et que M. Geoffroy a retrouvée et nommée mus cahirinus.”\r\nAjasson, vol. vi. p. 467, and Lemaire, _ubi supra_.—B. See B. viii. c.\r\n55, and B. x. c. 85.\r\n\r\n[2109] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 11, mentions this circumstance, but\r\nsays that it occurred in the island of Paros. For Gyara, see B. iv. c.\r\n23.\r\n\r\n[2110] We have two passages in Livy, B. xxvii. and B. xxx., where gold\r\nis said to have been gnawed by mice.—B.\r\n\r\n[2111] See B. iii. c. 9. In B.C. 217, this place was occupied by Fabius\r\nwith a strong garrison, to prevent Hannibal from passing the Vulturnus;\r\nand the following year, after the battle of Cannæ, was occupied by\r\na small body of Roman troops, who, though little more than 1000 in\r\nnumber, withstood the assaults of Hannibal during a protracted siege,\r\nuntil compelled by famine to surrender.\r\n\r\n[2112] This sum would be about £7.—B.\r\n\r\n[2113] It is by no means improbable that “occentus” here means\r\n“singing,” and not merely “squeaking;” as the singing of a mouse would\r\nno doubt be deemed particularly ill-boding in those times. At the\r\npresent day, a mouse has been heard to emit a noise which more nearly\r\nresembled singing than squeaking; and a “singing mouse” has been the\r\nsubject of an exhibition more than once.\r\n\r\n[2114] We have frequent allusions to this occurrence in the writings of\r\nthe Romans, some of which are referred to by Dalechamps; Lemaire, vol.\r\niii. p. 563.—B.\r\n\r\n[2115] A.U.C. 639; it does not appear what was the cause of this\r\nprohibition.—B.\r\n\r\n[2116] See B. xxxvi. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2117] Fulvius Lupinus, as already stated in c. 78.—B.\r\n\r\n[2118] “Nitelis.” See B. xvi. c. 69. Probably the animal now known as\r\nthe Myoxus nitela of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2119] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 33.—B.\r\n\r\n[2120] According to Hardouin, this forest is termed, in modern times,\r\nBosco di Baccano; it is nine miles S.W. of Rome.\r\n\r\n[2121] Cuvier informs us, that “Le dorcas des Grecs n’est le daim,\r\ncomme le dit Hardouin, mais le chevreuil; car Aristote (De Partib.\r\nAnim. l. iii. c. 2) dit que c’est le plus petit des animaux à cornes\r\nque nous connaissions (sans doute en Grèce); et le dorcas Libyca,\r\ntrès-bien decrit par Ælien (l. xiv. c. 4), est certainement la gazelle\r\ncommune, ‘antelope dorcas,’” Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 467, 468; Lemaire,\r\nvol. iii. p. 565. Respecting the localities here mentioned, it has been\r\nproposed to substitute Cilicia for Syria, Syria and Lycia being at a\r\nconsiderable distance from each other.—B.\r\n\r\n[2122] See B. v. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[2123] See B. v. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[2124] See B. iii. c. 11, and the Note to the passage. See also c. 81\r\nof this Book.\r\n\r\n[2125] Ælian, B. ii. c. 37, gives the same account of the frogs of\r\nSeriphos and the lake of Thessaly, but gives the name of Pierus to the\r\nlake.—B.\r\n\r\n[2126] “Mus araneüs; the ‘shrew-mouse,’” according to Cuvier, “La\r\nmusaraigne n’est pas venimeuse. Il s’en faut beaucoup qu’elle n’existe\r\npas au nord des Apennins; et elle ne périt point passe qu’elle a\r\ntraversé une ornière, quoique souvent elle puisse y être écrasée. C’est\r\nun des quadrupèdes que l’on tue le plus aisément par un coup léger.”\r\nAjasson, vol. vi. p. 468.—B.\r\n\r\n[2127] Ælian, B. iii. c. 32, gives the same account, which he professes\r\nto have taken from Theophrastus.—B.\r\n\r\n[2128] This is also stated by Ælian.\r\n\r\n[2129] B. xi. c. 23, and B. xxix. c. 27.—B.\r\n\r\n[2130] See B. iv. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2131] “Attagenæ;” the commentators have suspected some inaccuracy with\r\nrespect to this word, as we have no other remarks on birds in this part\r\nof Pliny’s work; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 567, 568.—B.\r\n\r\n[2132] See B. iv. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2133] See B. v. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[2134] More especially of trees, plants, flowers, medicinal substances,\r\nmetals, and gems, which form the most prominent subjects of the\r\nremaining Books after the eleventh, which concludes the account of the\r\nanimals.—B.\r\n\r\n[2135] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2136] A Roman historian, and a contemporary of Cicero. He is thought\r\nto have written on early Roman history, as Varro quotes his account\r\nof the Curtian Lake, and on the later history of Rome, as we have\r\nseen Pliny referring to him in c. 2, respecting Pompey’s triumph on\r\nhis return from Africa. He was held in high estimation by Pomponius\r\nAtticus, but seems not to have been so highly esteemed as a writer by\r\nCicero.\r\n\r\n[2137] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2138] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2139] Of this writer nothing seems to be known. He probably flourished\r\nin the reign of Tiberius or Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2140] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2141] A Roman historian, who flourished in the reign of Augustus, and\r\ndied A.D. 21, in the seventieth year of his age. His great work was\r\ncalled “Annales,” and extended to at least twenty-two books, and seems\r\nto have contained much minute, though not always accurate, information\r\nwith regard to the internal affairs of the city; only a few fragments\r\nremain, which bear reference to events subsequent to the Carthaginian\r\nwars. He is also thought to have written a work called “Epitomæ.”\r\nA treatise was published at Vienna, in 1510, in two Books, “On the\r\nPriesthood and Magistracy of Rome,” under the name of Fenestella;\r\nbut it is in reality the composition of Andrea Domenico Fiocchi, a\r\nFlorentine jurist of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n[2142] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2143] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[2144] L. Junius Moderatus Columella. He was a native of Gades, or\r\nCadiz, and was a contemporary of Celsus and Seneca. He is supposed to\r\nhave resided at Rome, and from his works it appears that he visited\r\nSyria and Cilicia. It has been conjectured that he died at Tarentum.\r\nHis great work is a systematic treatise upon Agriculture, divided into\r\nTwelve Books.\r\n\r\n[2145] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2146] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2147] C. Lucilius, the first Roman satirical poet of any importance,\r\nwas born B.C. 148, and died B.C. 103. From Juvenal we learn that he was\r\nborn at Suessa of the Aurunci, and from Velleius Paterculus and Horace\r\nother particulars respecting him. He is supposed to have been either\r\nthe maternal grand-uncle or maternal grandfather of Pompeius Magnus.\r\nIf not absolutely the inventor of Roman satire, he was the first to\r\nmould it into that form which was afterwards fully developed by Horace,\r\nJuvenal, and Perseus. He is spoken of in high terms as a writer by\r\nCicero, Horace, and Quintilian.\r\n\r\n[2148] The father of Cornelia, the wife of Pompeius Magnus. After his\r\ndefeat by Cæsar at the battle of Thapsus, he stabbed himself, and\r\nleaped into the sea. In what way he distinguished himself as an author,\r\ndoes not appear.\r\n\r\n[2149] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2150] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[2151] He was one of the companions of L. Lucullus, proconsul in\r\nBætica, the province of Spain, B.C. 150. His work on Natural History is\r\nseveral times referred to by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2152] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2153] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned by Varro and Columella.\r\nNothing more seems to be known of him.\r\n\r\n[2154] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[2155] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[2156] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2157] Of Tarsus, a Stoic philosopher, the disciple and successor of\r\nDiogenes, and the teacher of Panætius, about B.C. 144. Of his personal\r\nhistory but little is known. Mention is made of his History of Animals\r\nby the Scholiast upon Apollonius Rhodius.\r\n\r\n[2158] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2159] There were several physicians of this name; one was a native of\r\nApamea in Bithynia, a follower of Herophilus, who flourished in the\r\nthird or second century B.C.; another lived about the same period, and\r\nis by some supposed to have been the same as the last. No particulars\r\nseem to be known of the individual here mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2160] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2161] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2162] Of Miletus. He wrote on mythical subjects, and is mentioned as\r\nan author by Diogenes Laertius; but nothing further seems to have been\r\nknown respecting him.\r\n\r\n[2163] Some of the MSS. call him Acopas, or Copas. He was the author of\r\nan account of the victors at the Olympic games, the work here referred\r\nto by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2164] Hiero II., the king of Syracuse, and steady friend and ally of\r\nthe Romans. He died probably a little before the year B.C. 216, having\r\nattained the age of ninety-two. Varro and Columella speak of a Treatise\r\non Agriculture written by him.\r\n\r\n[2165] Attalus III., king of Pergamus, son of Eumenes II. and\r\nStratonice, daughter of Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia. In his will\r\nhe made the Roman people his heirs. Being struck with remorse for the\r\nmurders and other crimes of which he had previously been guilty, he\r\nabandoned all public business, and devoted himself to the study of\r\nphysic, sculpture, and gardening, on which he wrote a work. He died\r\nB.C. 133, of a fever, with which he was seized through exposing himself\r\nto the sun’s rays, while engaged in erecting a monument to his mother.\r\n\r\n[2166] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2167] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2168] An historian of Syracuse, one of the most celebrated of\r\nantiquity, though, unfortunately, none of his works have come down to\r\nus. He was born about B.C. 435, and died B.C. 356. He wrote histories\r\nof Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Phœnicia.\r\n\r\n[2169] A Greek of Tarentum, famous as a philosopher, mathematician,\r\nstatesman, and general. The lives of him by Aristoxenus and Aristotle\r\nare unfortunately lost. He lived probably about B.C. 400, and he is\r\nsaid to have saved the life of Plato by his influence with the tyrant\r\nDionysius. He was finally drowned in the Adriatic. He attained great\r\nskill as a practical mechanician; and his flying dove of wood was one\r\nof the wonders of antiquity. The fragments and titles of works ascribed\r\nto him are very numerous, but the genuineness of some is doubted.\r\n\r\n[2170] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2171] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\nIn B. xviii. c. 43, Pliny speaks of a work of his on lucerne clover and\r\ncytisus.\r\n\r\n[2172] Or Anaxipolis. He was a writer on Agricultural subjects, and\r\nis mentioned by Varro and Columella; but nothing further is known\r\nrespecting him.\r\n\r\n[2173] A writer on Agriculture. He is supposed to have lived before\r\nthe time of Aristotle, and is also mentioned by Varro. No further\r\nparticulars are known respecting him.\r\n\r\n[2174] A writer on Agriculture; Varro calls him a native of Mallus, in\r\nCilicia.\r\n\r\n[2175] A native of Cumæ or Cymæ, in Asia Minor, a Greek writer on\r\nAgriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2176] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2177] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro, Columella,\r\nGalen, and the Scholiast on Nicander.\r\n\r\n[2178] The most famous among the soothsayers of Alexander the Great. He\r\nprobably wrote the work on Prodigies, which is referred to by Pliny in\r\nB. xvii. c. 38, and elsewhere, as also by Lucian the satirist.\r\n\r\n[2179] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2180] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[2181] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2182] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2183] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2184] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2185] A writer on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2186] Or Euphonius, a writer on Agriculture, also mentioned by Varro\r\nand Columella. Nothing further is known relative to him.\r\n\r\n[2187] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2188] Menander of Priene was a writer on Agriculture, mentioned\r\nalso by Varro and Columella. Menander of Heraclea was a writer on\r\nAgriculture, mentioned also by Varro.\r\n\r\n[2189] A poet who wrote on Agriculture, mentioned also by Varro. It\r\nis not improbable that he is the same person with the Menecrates of\r\nSmyrna, the author of two epigrams in the Greek Anthology.\r\n\r\n[2190] A Greek writer on Agriculture, who wrote before the time of\r\nTheophrastus, by whom he is mentioned, as also by Athenæus and Varro.\r\n\r\n[2191] He is mentioned also by Varro, but nothing is known of him.\r\n\r\n[2192] He is often referred to by Varro and Columella. He is also\r\nsupposed to have been the writer of a History of Thebes, mentioned by\r\nthe Scholiast and Apollonius Rhodius, B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2193] Cassius Dionysius of Utica. He translated into Greek the\r\ntwenty-eight Books on Husbandry written by Mago the Carthaginian, in\r\nthe Punic language. Of Mago nothing further is known.\r\n\r\n[2194] Diophanes of Bithynia made an epitome of the same work in Greek,\r\nand dedicated it to King Deiotarus. Columella styles Mago the Father of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n[2195] Made king of Cappadocia by Antony, B.C. 34. He died at Rome, at\r\nan advanced age, A.D. 17. Plutarch attributes to King Archelaus—if,\r\nindeed, this was the same—a treatise on Minerals.\r\n\r\n[2196] A native of Claros, near Colophon, in Ionia. It is not a matter\r\nof certainty, but it is most probable, that he lived in the reign\r\nof Ptolemy V., who died B.C. 181. He was a poet, grammarian, and\r\nphysician. His “Theriaca,” a poem on the wounds inflicted by venomous\r\nanimals, still exists, as also another called “Alexipharmia.”\r\n\r\n[2197] He has already said, in B. ii. c. 3, that “the seeds of all\r\nbodies fall down from the heavens, principally into the ocean, and\r\nbeing mixed together, we find that a variety of monstrous forms are in\r\nthis way frequently produced.”\r\n\r\n[2198] Hardouin has the following remark on this passage. “Rondelet\r\nand Aldrovandus only waste their time and pains in making their minute\r\ninquiries into the present names of these fish, which took their names\r\nfrom grapes, the wood, the saw, and the cucumber; for by no other\r\nwriter do we find them mentioned even.” Cuvier, however, does not seem\r\nto be of Hardouin’s opinion, that such investigations are a waste of\r\ntime, and has suggested that the eggs of the Sepia officinalis may be\r\nalluded to, the eggs of which are in clusters of a dark colour, and\r\nbearing a strong resemblance to black grapes. This resemblance to a\r\nbunch of grapes is noticed by Pliny himself, in c. 74 of the present\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2199] He alludes, most probably, to what we call the “sword-fish,” the\r\n“Xiphias gladius” of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2200] Probably, in allusion to the “Squalus pristis” of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2201] Cuvier suggests that he probably alludes to the “Holothuria\r\npentactes” of Linnæus, or the sea-priapus; and remarks, that when\r\nthe animal contracts itself, it bears a very strong resemblance to a\r\ncucumber.\r\n\r\n[2202] Cuvier says, that he most probably alludes to the “Syngnathus\r\nhippocampus” of Linnæus. This little fish, he says, is also called\r\nthe sea-horse, and having the body armed with a hard coat, might very\r\neasily have been taken for a shell-fish. Its head, in miniature, bears\r\na very strong resemblance to that of a horse.\r\n\r\n[2203] It is not accurately known what fish was meant by the ancients,\r\nunder the name of “balæna.” According to some writers, it is considered\r\nto be the same with what we call the “grampus.”\r\n\r\n[2204] A space, as Hardouin remarks, greater than that occupied by\r\nsome towns, the “jugerum” being 240 feet long, and 120 broad. The vast\r\nsize of great fishes was a favourite subject with some of the ancient\r\nwriters, and their accounts were eagerly copied by some of the early\r\nfathers. Bochart has collected these various accounts in his work on\r\nAnimals, B. i. c. 7. In the “Arabian Nights” also, we find accounts of\r\nhuge fishes in the eastern seas, so large as to be taken for islands.\r\nThe existence of the sea-serpent is still a question in dispute; and a\r\nwhale of large size, is a formidable obstacle in the way of a ship of\r\neven the largest burthen.\r\n\r\n[2205] As Hardouin remarks, we can learn neither from the works of\r\nPliny, nor yet of Ælian, what fish the pristis really was. From Nonius\r\nMarcellus, c. 13, we find that it was a very long fish of large size,\r\nbut narrow body. Hardouin says that it was a fish of the cetaceous\r\nkind, found in the Indian seas, which, in his time, was known by some\r\nas the “vivella,” with a long bony muzzle serrated on either side,\r\nevidently meaning the saw-fish. Pristis was a favourite name given by\r\nthe Romans to their ships. In the boat-race described by Virgil in the\r\nÆneid, B. v., one of the boats is so called.\r\n\r\n[2206] Cuvier remarks, that he himself had often seen the “langouste,”\r\nor large lobster, as much as four feet in length, and the “homard,”\r\nusually a smaller kind, of an equal size. The length, however, given\r\nby Pliny would make six or eight feet, according to the length of the\r\ncubit.\r\n\r\n[2207] Cuvier says, that it is an exaggeration by travellers, which\r\nthere is nothing in nature at all to justify. Probably, however, some\r\nanimals of the genus boa, or python, or large water-snakes may have\r\ngiven rise to the story.\r\n\r\n[2208] On the southern coast of Arabia.\r\n\r\n[2209] Ptolemy Philadelphus.\r\n\r\n[2210] See B. vi. c. 23, 25. Strabo, in his fifteenth Book, tells the\r\nsame story of the Ichthyophagi, situate between the Carmani and the\r\nOritæ. Dalechamps suggests that the Gedrosi mentioned this in relation\r\nto the Ichthyophagi, who were probably their neighbours.\r\n\r\n[2211] Also called the Cophetes. See B. vi. c. 25. The commander of\r\nAlexander’s fleet more especially alluded to, is probably Nearchus,\r\nwho wrote an account of his voyage, to which Pliny has previously made\r\nallusion in B. vi. and which is followed by Strabo, in B. xv., and by\r\nArrian, in his “Indica.”\r\n\r\n[2212] Hardouin remarks, that the Basques of his day were in the habit\r\nof fencing their gardens with the ribs of the whale, which sometimes\r\nexceeded twenty feet in length; and Cuvier says, that at the present\r\ntime, the jaw-bone of the whale is used in Norway for the purpose of\r\nmaking beams or posts for buildings.\r\n\r\n[2213] Onesicritus, quoted by Strabo, B. xv., says., that in the\r\nvicinity of Taprobane, or Ceylon, there were animals which had an\r\namphibious life, some of which resembled oxen, some horses, and various\r\nother land animals. Cuvier is of opinion, that not improbably the\r\n“Trichecum manatum” and the “Trichecum dugong” of Linnæus are alluded\r\nto, which are herbivorous animals, though nearly allied to the cetacea,\r\nand which are in the habit of coming to pasture on the grass or\r\nsea-weed they may chance to find on the shore.\r\n\r\n[2214] It is remarked by Cuvier, that there is no resemblance whatever\r\nbetween the domesticated animals and any of the cetacea; but that\r\nthe imagination of the vulgar has pictured to itself these supposed\r\nresemblances, by the aid of a lively imagination.\r\n\r\n[2215] From the Greek φυσητὴρ, “a blower,” probably one of the whale\r\nspecies, so called from its blowing forth the water. Hardouin remarks,\r\nthat Pliny mentions the Gallic Ocean, in B. vi. c. 33, as ending at\r\nthe Pyrenees; and, probably, by this term he means the modern Bay of\r\nBiscay. Rondeletius, B. xvi. c. 14, says, that this fish is the same\r\nthat is called by the Narbonnese peio mular, by the Italians capidolio,\r\nand by the people of Saintonge, “sedenette.” Cuvier conjectures\r\nalso, that this was some kind of large whale; a fish which was not\r\nunfrequently found, in former times, in the gulf of Aquitaine, the\r\ninhabitants of the shores of which were skilled in its pursuit. Ajasson\r\nstates that Valmont de Bomare was of opinion that it was the porpoise;\r\nbut, as he justly remarks, the size of that animal does not at all\r\ncorrespond with the magnitude of the “physeter,” as here mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2216] Cuvier suggests that the idea of such an animal as the one here\r\nmentioned, probably took its rise in the kind of sea star-fish, now\r\nknown as Medusa’s head, the Asterias of Linnæus; but that the enormous\r\nsize here attributed to it, has no foundation whatever in reality. He\r\nremarks also, that the inhabitants of the north of Europe, have similar\r\nstories relative to a huge polypus, which they call the “kraken.” We\r\nmay, however, be allowed to observe, that the “kraken,” or “korven,”\r\nmentioned by good bishop Pontoppidan, bears a closer resemblance to the\r\nso-called “sea-serpent,” than to anything of the polypus or sepia genus.\r\n\r\n[2217] “Rotæ.” Cuvier suggests that this idea of the wheel was taken\r\nfrom the class of zoophytes named “Medusæ,” by Linnæus, which have the\r\nform of a disc, divided by radii, and dots which may have been taken\r\nfor eyes. But then, as he says, there are none of them of an excessive\r\nsize, as Pliny would seem to indicate by placing them in this Chapter,\r\nand which Ælian has absolutely attributed to them in B. xiii. c. 20.\r\nOf the largest rhizostoma, Cuvier says, that he had even seen, the\r\ndiameter of the disc did not exceed two feet.\r\n\r\n[2218] Lisbon. See B. iv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[2219] One of the Scholiasts on Homer says, that before the discovery\r\nof the brazen trumpet by the Tyrrhenians, the conch-shell was in\r\ngeneral use for that purpose. Hardouin, with considerable credulity,\r\nremarks here, that it is no fable, that the nereids and tritons had a\r\nhuman face; and says that no less than fifteen instances, ancient and\r\nmodern, had been adduced, in proof that such was the fact. He says that\r\nthis was the belief of Scaliger, and quotes the book of Aldrovandus on\r\nMonsters, p. 36. But, as Cuvier remarks, it is impossible to explain\r\nthese stories of nereids and tritons, on any other grounds than the\r\nfraudulent pretences of those who have exhibited them, or asserted that\r\nthey have seen them. “It was only last year,” he says, “that all London\r\nwas resorting to see a wonderful sight in what is commonly called a\r\nmermaid. I myself had the opportunity of examining a very similar\r\nobject: it was the body of a child, in the mouth of which they had\r\nintroduced the jaws of a sparus [probably our “gilt-head],” while for\r\nthe legs was substituted the body of a lizard. The body of the London\r\nmermaid,” he says, “was that of an ape, and a fish attached to it\r\nsupplied the place of the hind legs.”\r\n\r\n[2220] Primarily the nereids were sea-nymphs, the daughters of Nereus\r\nand Doris. Dalechamps informs us, that Alexander ab Alexandro states\r\nthat he once saw a nereid that had been thrown ashore on the coasts of\r\nthe Peloponnesus, that Trapezuntius saw one as it was swimming, and\r\nthat Draconetus Bonifacius, the Neapolitan, saw a triton that had been\r\npreserved in honey, and which many had seen when taken alive on the\r\ncoast of Epirus. We may here remark, that the triton is the same as our\r\n“mer-man,” and the nereid is our “mermaid.”\r\n\r\n[2221] Of Gallia Lugdunensis, namely. The legatus was also called\r\n“rector,” and “proprætor.”\r\n\r\n[2222] Or “mer-man,” as we call it. Dalechamps, in his note, with all\r\nthe credulity of his time, states that a similar sea-man had been\r\ncaptured, it was said, in the preceding age in Norway, and that another\r\nhad been seen in Poland, dressed like a bishop, in the year 1531.\r\nJuvenal, in his 14th Satire, makes mention of the “monsters of the\r\nocean, and the youths of the sea.”\r\n\r\n[2223] See B. iv. c. 31, 32.\r\n\r\n[2224] See B. iv. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[2225] Dalechamps says that this elephant is the same as the “rosmarus”\r\nof Olaus Magnus, B. xxxii. c. 11. It is remarked by Cuvier, that\r\ncetaceous animals have at all times received the names of those\r\nbelonging to the land. The sea-ram, he thinks, may have been the great\r\ndolphin, which is called the “bootskopf,” and which has above the eye a\r\nwhite spot, curved in nearly a similar manner to the horn of a ram. The\r\n“elephant,” again, he suggests, may have been the Trichechus rosmarus\r\nof Linnæus, or the morse, which has large tusks projecting from its\r\nmouth, similar to those of the elephant. This animal, however, as he\r\nsays, is confined to the northern seas, and does not appear ever to\r\nhave come so far south as our coasts. Juba and Pausanias, however,\r\nspeak of these horns of the sea-ram as being really teeth or tusks.\r\n\r\n[2226] Judging from the account of it here given, and especially in\r\nrelation to the teeth, Cuvier is inclined to think that the cachelot\r\nwhale, the Physeter macrocephalus of Linnæus, is the animal here\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n[2227] Solinus, generally a faithful mimic of Pliny, makes the measure\r\nonly half a foot. Cuvier says that there can be little doubt that the\r\nbones represented to have been those of the monster to which Andromeda\r\nwas exposed, were the bones, and more especially the lower jaws, of the\r\nwhale. Ajasson certainly appears to have mistaken the sense of this\r\npassage. He says that it must not be supposed that Pliny means the\r\nidentical bones of the animal which was about to devour Andromeda, but\r\nof one of the animals of that kind; and he exercises his wit at the\r\nexpense of those who would construe the passage differently, in saying\r\nthat these bones ought to have been sent to those who show in their\r\ncollections such articles as the knife with which Cain slew Abel. Now,\r\nthere can be no doubt that these bones were _not_ those of the monster\r\nwhich the poets tell us was about to devour Andromeda; but the Romans\r\ncertainly supposed that they were, and Pliny evidently thought so too,\r\nfor in B. v. c. 14, he speaks of the chains by which she was fastened\r\nto the rock, at Joppa, as still to be seen there. M. Æmilius Scaurus,\r\nthe younger, is here referred to.\r\n\r\n[2228] As already mentioned, there is considerable doubt what fish of\r\nthe whale species is meant under this name. Cuvier says, that even at\r\nthe present day whales are occasionally found in the Mediterranean, and\r\nsays that there is the head of one in the Museum of Natural History,\r\nthat was thrown ashore at Martigues. He also observes, that in the year\r\n1829, one had been cast upon the coasts of Languedoc. Ajasson suggests,\r\nthat not improbably whales once frequented the Mediterranean in great\r\nnumbers, but that as commerce increased, they gradually retreated to\r\nthe open ocean.\r\n\r\n[2229] Rondelet, B. xvi. c. 13, says that this animal was called\r\n“espaular” by the people of Saintonge. Cuvier is of opinion, also, that\r\nit is the same animal, which is also known by the name of “bootskopf,”\r\nthe Delphinus orca of Linnæus. (See N. [2225].) This cetaceous animal,\r\nhe says, is a most dangerous enemy to the whale, which it boldly\r\nattacks, devouring its tongue, which is of a tender quality and\r\nenormous size. He thinks, however, that the orca taken at the port of\r\nOstia was no other than a cachelot.\r\n\r\n[2230] The Liburna, or Liburnica, was usually a bireme, or two-oared\r\ngalley, with the mast in the middle, though sometimes of larger bulk.\r\nFrom the description given of these by Varro, as quoted by Aulus\r\nGellius, B. xvii. c. 3, they seem, as it has been remarked, somewhat\r\nsimilar to the light Indian massooliah boats, which are used to cross\r\nthe surf? in Madras roads. Pliny tells us, in B. xvi. c. 17, that the\r\nmaterial of which they were constructed was pine timber, as free from\r\nresin as it could possibly be obtained. The beak of these vessels was\r\nof great comparative weight, and its sharpness is evidently alluded to\r\nin the present passage, as also in B. x. c. 32. The term “Liburna” was\r\nadopted from the assistance rendered to Augustus by the Liburni at the\r\nbattle of Actium.\r\n\r\n[2231] These works were completed by Nero the successor of Claudius,\r\nand consisted of a new and more capacious harbour on the right arm of\r\nthe Tiber. It was afterwards enlarged and improved by Trajan. This\r\nharbour was simply called “Portus Romanus,” or “Portus Augusti;” and\r\naround it there sprang up a town known as “Portus,” the inhabitants of\r\nwhich were called “Portuenses.”\r\n\r\n[2232] “Naufragiis tergorum.” This may probably mean a shipwreck, in\r\nwhich some hides had fallen into the sea.\r\n\r\n[2233] It is remarked by Rezzonico, that Palermus, in the account of\r\nthis story given by him in B. i. c. 1, has mistaken Pliny’s meaning,\r\nand evidently thinks that “unum” refers to the soldiers, and not the\r\nboats engaged in the attack.\r\n\r\n[2234] “Ora.” Cuvier remarks, that it is not the “mouth of the animal\r\nbut the nostrils, that are situate on the top of the head, and that\r\nthrough these it sends forth vast columns of water.” Aristotle, in his\r\nHist. Anim. B. i. c. 3, has a similar passage, from which Pliny copied\r\nthis assertion of his.\r\n\r\n[2235] Cuvier remarks, that these are the animals of the cetaceous\r\nclass, which resemble the quadrupeds in the formation of the viscera,\r\ntheir respiration, and the mammæ; and which, in fact, only differ from\r\nthem in their general form, which more nearly resembles that of fishes.\r\n\r\n[2236] Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2237] “Doctrinæ indaginibus.” This certainly seems a better reading\r\nthan “doctrina indignis,” which has been adopted by Sillig, and which\r\nwould make complete nonsense of the passage.\r\n\r\n[2238] Dalechamps states that Cælius Rhodiginus, B. iv. c. 15, has\r\nentered very fully into this subject.\r\n\r\n[2239] Cuvier remarks, on this passage, that the mollusca have, instead\r\nof blood, a kind of azure or colourless liquid. He observes also,\r\nthat insects respire by means of tracheæ, or elastic tubes, which\r\npenetrate into every part of the body; and that the gills of fish are\r\nas essentially an organ of respiration as the lungs. All, he says,\r\nthat Pliny adds as to the introduction of air into water, is equally\r\nconformable to truth; and that it is by means of the air mingled with\r\nthe water, or of the atmosphere which they inhale at the surface, that\r\nfishes respire.\r\n\r\n[2240] In the shape of vapour raised by the action of the sun. In\r\naccordance with this opinion, Cicero says, De Nat. Deor. B. ii. s. 27,\r\n“The air arises from the respiration of the waters, and must be looked\r\nupon as a sort of vapour coming from them.”\r\n\r\n[2241] But, as Hardouin remarks, this act on the part of the fish is\r\ncaused as much by the water as the air.\r\n\r\n[2242] As Hardouin remarks, this is a somewhat singular notion that\r\nsleep is produced by the action of the lungs.\r\n\r\n[2243] Hardouin asks, what this has to do with the question about the\r\nair which Pliny is here discussing? and then suggests that his meaning\r\nmay possibly be, that the moon has an influence on bodies through the\r\nmedium of the air, in accordance with the notion of the ancients that\r\nthe respiration was more free during the time of full moon. Littré\r\nsays, that Pliny’s meaning is, that since the influence of the moon\r\nis able to penetrate the waters, the air and the vital breath can of\r\ncourse penetrate them also.\r\n\r\n[2244] See B. x. c. 89, where this subject is further discussed.\r\n\r\n[2245] “Infectum aera.”\r\n\r\n[2246] See Aristotle, De Part. Anim. B. iv. c. 13, and Hist. Anim. B.\r\nviii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2247] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2248] Cuvier remarks, that these nostrils, or vent-holes, are placed\r\nsomewhat further back on the head in the dolphin than in the whale; but\r\nat the same time they cannot be said to be situate on the back of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n[2249] Or “seals.” They will be further mentioned in c. 15 of the\r\npresent Book.\r\n\r\n[2250] Or “turtles,” which are more fully described in c. 21 of this\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2251] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2252] Cuvier remarks, that in the present Chapter there is a confusion\r\nof the peculiarities of two different animals, and refers the reader\r\nto his Note on B. viii. c. 38, which, so far as it has not been set\r\nforth, is to the following effect:—“I may here remark, that Pliny\r\nspeaks on several occasions of dolphins with spines or stings on the\r\nback, although at other times he is found to give that name to the same\r\ncetaceous animal which is so denominated by us. Thus, in his story in\r\nB. ix. c. 8, of the friendship conceived by a dolphin in Lake Lucrinus\r\nfor a child at Baiæ, he takes care to remark that the dolphin, when\r\ntaking the child on his back, concealed his spines beneath his dorsal\r\nfin. I am of opinion, however, that I have recognized the fish which\r\nSeneca, Pliny, and even Aristotle have sometimes confounded with the\r\nreal dolphin, apparently because it had received that name from certain\r\nfishermen, and these are my reasons for forming this conclusion. In\r\nc. 7 of the Ninth Book, Pliny mingles with many facts that really do\r\nbelong to the real dolphin, one trait which is quite foreign to it. ‘It\r\nis so swift,’ says he, ‘that were it not for the fact that its mouth is\r\nsituate much beneath its muzzle, almost, indeed, in the middle of its\r\nbelly, not a fish would be able to escape its pursuit: in consequence\r\nof this, it can only seize its prey by turning on its back.’ This,\r\nit must be observed, is not one of those mistakes which we are to\r\nput down to Pliny’s own account, and of which he has so many; for we\r\nfind Aristotle as well, who has so perfectly known and described the\r\nordinary dolphin, attributing a mouth similarly situate to the dolphin\r\nand the cartilaginous animals. This fact, which is totally false as\r\nregards the real dolphin, is, in all probability, applicable to the\r\nalleged dolphin, whose back is mentioned as being armed with spines.\r\nThese three characteristics, a mouth situate very far beneath the\r\nnose, spines on the back, and power and swiftness sufficient to enable\r\nit to fight the crocodile, are only to be found united in certain of\r\nthe genus ‘Squalus,’ such as the ‘Squalus centrina,’ and the ‘Squalus\r\nspinax’ of Linnæus.”\r\n\r\n[2253] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5. From this description\r\nHardouin is induced to think that Rondelet and Aldrovandus are wrong\r\nin their conclusions that it is the sea-hog, or porpoise, that is\r\nmeant. Cuvier also says, that this description will not apply to\r\nthe real dolphin, though it is strictly applicable to the Squalus\r\nacanthias, Squalus ricinus, and others; to the former of which also\r\nthe spines or stings mentioned by Pliny appropriately belong; all the\r\nother characteristics, he says, which are here mentioned by Pliny,\r\nare applicable to the real dolphin, though in modern times it has\r\nnever been brought to such a degree of tameness. Hence it is that some\r\nwriters have supposed that Pliny is here speaking of the Trichechus\r\nmanatus of Linnæus, by the French called “lamentin,” by us the\r\n“sea-cow.” Cuvier says, that he should be inclined to be of the same\r\nopinion, were it not for the fact that that animal does not frequent\r\nthe coasts of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[2254] Copied literally from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5, and\r\nDe Part. Anim. B. iv. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[2255] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2256] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 48, says not the _sails_,\r\nbut the _masts_ of ships; and Pintianus remarks, that Pliny has been\r\ndeceived by the resemblance of the words, ἱστὸς and ἱστίον. Ælian,\r\nHist. Anim. B. xii. c. 12, has a similar statement also.\r\n\r\n[2257] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 9. Oppian, Halieut. B. i. l.\r\n660.\r\n\r\n[2258] Fishermen having notched the tail of the animal when young, and\r\nrecognized it by these marks thirty years afterwards.\r\n\r\n[2259] “Incertâ de causâ.” Pintianus, following the similar account\r\ngiven by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 48, takes the words to mean\r\n“temere,” “hap-hazard,” “without any motive whatever.” Ajasson says\r\nthat it is their eager pursuit of small fishes which sometimes betrays\r\nthem into leaping on shore, and occasionally, the pain caused by\r\nattacks of parasitical sea-insects and other animals.\r\n\r\n[2260] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 49, says that the dolphin makes\r\nthis noise when it comes to the air.\r\n\r\n[2261] He would seem to imply that the dolphin knows that it is\r\n“simus,” or “flat-nosed,” for which reason it is particularly fond\r\nof being called “Simo,” or “flat-nose,” a piece of good taste and\r\nintelligence remarkable even in a dolphin. Hardouin undertakes to\r\nexplain their remarkable liking for this name on other grounds, and\r\nsays that when a song was sung, they were charmed by the pronunciation\r\nof the word “Simo” every now and then, the last syllable being drawn\r\nout at great length. Ajasson suggests that the only reason for which\r\nthis name delighted them, was probably the sibilant or hissing sound\r\nmade when it is frequently repeated.\r\n\r\n[2262] “Symphoniæ cantu.” Hardouin is of opinion that this means the\r\nmusic of the “symphonia,” that being some kind of musical instrument.\r\nBut, as Ajasson remarks, the meaning is much more likely to be,\r\n“singing in concert,” where there are several performers, and each\r\ntakes his own part in the symphony. It might, however, possibly mean\r\nsinging and music combined, similar to the performance of Arion,\r\nmentioned at the end of the Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2263] The organ was so called by the ancients, from the resemblance\r\nborne by its pipes to “hydraula,” or water-pipes, and from the fact\r\nof the bellows being acted on by the pressure of water. According to\r\nan author quoted by Athenæus, B. iv. c. 75, the first organist was\r\nCtesibius of Alexandria, who lived about B.C. 200. It is not improbable\r\nthat Pliny refers to this invention in B. vii. c. 38. The pipes of\r\nthe organ of Ctesibius were partly of bronze and partly of reed, and\r\nTertullian describes it as a very complicated instrument.\r\n\r\n[2264] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 15, tells this story as well, and\r\nAulus Gellius, B. vii. c. 8, relates it from the fifth Book of the\r\nÆgyptiaca of Apion, who stated that he himself had witnessed the fact.\r\n\r\n[2265] The Lucrine Lake originally communicated with the sea, but\r\nwas afterwards separated from the Bay of Cumæ by a dyke eight stadia\r\nin length. In the time of Augustus, however, Agrippa opened a\r\ncommunication between the Lake and the Bay, for the purpose of forming\r\nthe Julian harbour. If the circumstance here mentioned by Pliny\r\nhappened before this period, “invectus” must mean “carried by human\r\nagency;” but if after, it is possible that the fish may have been\r\ncarried into the lake by the tide. For an account of the lake, see B.\r\niii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2266] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2267] “Pinnarum aculeas.” See the remarks of Cuvier on this passage,\r\nand his conclusion as to the fish meant, in his Note in p. 369.\r\n\r\n[2268] Oppian, in his Halieutica, B. v. l. 453, mentions this story\r\nalso, and of course Solinus does.\r\n\r\n[2269] See B. v. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2270] The island and city of Caria. See B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2271] Being alarmed by the pursuit of the fish while he was swimming.\r\n\r\n[2272] Athenæus, B. xiii., tells this story more at large, and states\r\nthat the name of the child was Dionysius. Hardouin remarks, that\r\nSolinus, the ape of Pliny, has absolutely read this passage as though\r\nthe child’s name had been Babylon; upon the strength of which, Saumaise\r\nhad proposed to alter the reading in Pliny, not remembering at the time\r\nthat the boy’s name had been given by Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[2273] This story is also told by Plutarch, in his work on the\r\nInstincts of Animals.\r\n\r\n[2274] Aulus Gellius, B. vii. c. 8, mentions this story, borrowing it\r\nprobably from Theophrastus.\r\n\r\n[2275] The people of the territory in which Amphilochian Argos was\r\nsituate, and lying to the south of Ambracia. See B. iv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2276] The people of Tarentum. See B. iii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2277] Ovid tells the story of Arion more fully, and in beautiful\r\nlanguage, in the Fasti, B. ii. l. 92, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2278] A promontory in the south of Laconia, now Cape Matapan. See B.\r\niv. c. 7. Solinus, c. 7, tells us that there was a temple of Arion of\r\nMethymna, situate on this spot, in which there was a figure of him\r\nseated on a dolphin’s back, and made of bronze; with an inscription\r\nstating that this wonderful circumstance took place in the 29th\r\nOlympiad, in which year Arion had been victorious in the Sicilian\r\ngames. Philostorgius, in B. i. of his Ecclesiastical History, tells\r\nus also of a martyr who was saved by a dolphin, which bore him to\r\nHelenopolis, a city of Nicomedia.\r\n\r\n[2279] Now Nismes. See B. iii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2280] Still known as the Lake of Lattes, in the department of\r\nNarbonne. Cuvier says that the mullet-fishing is still carried on\r\nin this lake, which is on the shores of Languedoc, and refers to\r\nD’Astruc’s Memoirs on the Natural History of that province. The\r\ndolphins, however, he says, no longer take part in the sport; and\r\nhe observes that the same story is told by Ælian, B. ii. c. 8, and\r\nAlbertus Magnus, De Anim. B. xxiv., with reference to other places.\r\nOppian, in his Halieutica, B. v., makes Eubœa the scene of these\r\nadventures, while Albertus Magnus speaks of the shores of Italy.\r\nRondelet, in his Book on Fishes, says that it used to take place on\r\nthe coasts of Spain, near Palamos. Cuvier suggests, with Belon and\r\nD’Astruc, that the story arose from the fact that the dolphins, while\r\npursuing the shoals of mullets, sometimes drove them into the creeks\r\nand salt-water lakes on the coast; a fact which has been sometimes\r\nfound to cause the fish to be caught in greater abundance.\r\n\r\n[2281] Dalechamps tells us that the people of Montpellier call this\r\noutlet “La Crau,” and that it is in the vicinity of Mangueil.\r\n\r\n[2282] Were it not for the word “nihilominus” here, it would look as\r\nif the meaning were, that although the ends of the nets are hoisted\r\nup, the fish are so active that they jump over the side, and thus get\r\nenclosed. By the use of that word, however, it would seem to mean, that\r\nalthough the sides are hoisted up, the fish are so nimble, that they\r\nclear the nets altogether. If the latter is the meaning, Pliny probably\r\nintends to speak only of what some of them are able to do: otherwise it\r\nis hard to see of what utility the nets were in the operation.\r\n\r\n[2283] “Quos interemere.” Pintianus suggests “æquo interim jure”—“with\r\nequal rights,” instead of these words, and Pelicier does not disapprove\r\nof the suggestion; for Ælian states, in B. ii. c. 8, Hist. Anim.,\r\nthat the dolphins used to share the fish equally with the fishermen\r\nof Eubœa. But, as Hardouin says, the words “quos interemere” have\r\nreference to the statement above, that “they content themselves for the\r\npresent with killing them only.” And besides, if the fishermen gave\r\nthem an equal share, it is not likely that they would give them still\r\nmore of the fish on the following day.\r\n\r\n[2284] Ælian also mentions this, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2285] The same is stated in Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 74, and\r\nÆlian, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2286] This is also mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2287] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2288] Cuvier remarks, that there is some confusion here between an\r\nanimal of the dolphin kind, and another of the genus Squalus. He\r\nsuggests that the Delphinus tursio of Linnæus (our porpoise) is meant;\r\nbut then there would be no ground for comparing its teeth with those of\r\nthe dog-fish or shark. He remarks also, that Athenæus, B. vii. p. 310,\r\nspeaks of pieces of salted flesh from the dog-fish, as being called by\r\nthe name of tursio.\r\n\r\n[2289] Under this name he probably means the shark as well as the\r\ndog-fish. This passage is curiously rendered by Holland. “But\r\nespecially they are snouted like dogges, when they snarle, grin, and\r\nare readie to do a shrewd turne.”\r\n\r\n[2290] We may here remark, that Pliny throughout calls these\r\nanimals “testudines,”—“tortoises.” It has been thought better, in\r\nthe translation, in order to avoid confusion, to give them their\r\ndistinctive name of “turtle.”\r\n\r\n[2291] This passage, down to the words “to the fishermen,” is found in\r\nAgatharchides, as quoted by Photius.\r\n\r\n[2292] See B. xxxii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2293] Cuvier says that this is evidently a gross exaggeration on the\r\npart of some traveller; and Ajasson remarks, that the very largest\r\nturtle known does not exceed five feet in length, and four in breadth.\r\nIn such a case, the superficies of the calapash or shell would be only\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-four feet, and this, be it remembered, in one of\r\nthe very largest size.\r\n\r\n[2294] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 3, has a similar passage.\r\n\r\n[2295] See B. v. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2296] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 3, states to a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[2297] Oppian, Halieut. B. i. l. 522, has a passage to a somewhat\r\nsimilar effect. Holland’s notion of the meaning of this passage is\r\nsingular in the extreme. “The female fleeth from the male, and will not\r\nabide to engender, until such time as he pricke her behind, and sticke\r\nsomewhat in her taile for running away from him so fast.”\r\n\r\n[2298] Cuvier remarks, that it is evident that the fore-feet were here\r\ntaken for horns, they being in the turtle long, narrow, and pointed.\r\n\r\n[2299] From the Greek χέλυον, “tortoise-shell.” See B. vi. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[2300] Or “turtle eaters.” See B. vi. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[2301] From χερσιναὶ, “land turtles,” or “tortoises.”\r\n\r\n[2302] “Repositorium” seems to have been the name for a large tray\r\nupon which viands were brought to table; and probably for stands\r\nsimilar to our sideboards, as well as cabinets or wardrobes. Carvilius\r\nPollio, a Roman eques, lived in the time of the Dictator Sylla, and\r\nwas celebrated for his luxury in ornamental furniture. He is again\r\nmentioned by Pliny in B. xxx. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[2303] The Latin is “cortex,” which probably means a “bark,” or “rind.”\r\nAjasson remarks upon the meagreness of the Latin language, in supplying\r\nappropriate words for scientific purposes, and congratulates himself\r\nupon adding the word, “carapax,” (signifying “callipash,” as we call\r\nit) to the Latin vocabulary.\r\n\r\n[2304] By us known as the “angel-fish,” the “Squalus squatina” of\r\nLinnæus, a kind of shark. From this property of its skin, it was called\r\nby the Greeks ῥίνη the “file.” See B. xxxii. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[2305] Probably the Muræna helena of Linnæus. See more on it in c. 23\r\nof the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2306] Spoken of more fully in c. 23 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2307] Cuvier remarks, how very inappropriately Pliny places the\r\npristis (probably the saw-fish) and the balæna among the animals that\r\nare covered with hair. Aristotle, he says, in his Hist. Anim. B. vi. c.\r\n12, goes so far as to say that the pristis and the ox-fish (a kind of\r\nray or thorn-back, probably) bring forth their young like the balæna\r\nand the dolphin, but does not go beyond that. Cuvier says also, that\r\nwhat is here stated of the sea-calf is in general correct, except the\r\nstatements as to the properties of its skin and its right fin, the\r\nstories relative to which are, of course, neither more nor less than\r\nfabulous.\r\n\r\n[2308] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 11, states to the like effect.\r\n\r\n[2309] “Fremitu.” From their lowing noise, the French have also called\r\nthese animals “veaux de mer,” and we call them “sea-calves.” Ælian,\r\nHist. Anim. B. xii. c. 56, and Diodorus Siculus, B. iii., also speak of\r\ntraining the sea-calf. Hardouin says that Lopez de Gomara, one of the\r\nmore recent writers on Mexico, in his day, had given an account of an\r\nIndian sea-calf, or manati, as it was called by the natives, that had\r\nbecome quite tame, and answered readily to its name; and that, although\r\nnot very large, it was able to bear ten men on its back. He also tells\r\nus of a much more extraordinary one, which Aldrovandus says he himself\r\nhad seen at Bologna, which would give a cheer (vocem ederet) for the\r\nChristian princes when asked, but would refuse to do so for the Turks;\r\njust, Hardouin says, as we see dogs bark, and monkeys grin and jump, at\r\nthe mention of a particular name.\r\n\r\n[2310] Oppian, Halieut. B. i. l. 408, mentions this fact, and Juvenal,\r\nSat. iii. l. 238, alludes to it: “Would break the slumbers of Drusus\r\nand of sea-calves.”\r\n\r\n[2311] This assertion, though untrue, no doubt, as to sympathy with\r\nthe tides, is in some degree supported by the statement of Rondelet,\r\nB. xvi. c. 6, who says that he had often perceived changes in the wind\r\nand weather prognosticated by the hide of this animal; for that when a\r\nsouth wind was about to blow, the hair would stand erect, while when a\r\nnorth wind was on the point of arising, it would lie so flat that you\r\nwould hardly know that there was any hair on the surface.\r\n\r\n[2312] Hardouin remarks, that Pliny classes the viper probably among\r\nthe aquatic animals, either because it was said to couple with\r\nthe muræna, or else because it has a womb not unlike that of the\r\ncartilaginous fishes.\r\n\r\n[2313] Hardouin suggests that the proper reading here is probably\r\n144, because in B. xxxii. c. 51, Pliny speaks of 174 different kinds\r\nof fishes, and here he says that the crustacea are thirty in number.\r\nDaubenton speaks of the species of fishes as being 866 in number,\r\nwhile Lacèpede says that he had examined more than a thousand, but\r\nthat was far below the real number. Cuvier mentions specimens of about\r\n6000 kinds of fishes, in the Cabinet du Roi. Ajasson remarks upon the\r\nlearned investigations of Cuvier on this subject, and his researches in\r\nSumatra, Java, Kamschatka, New Zealand, New Guinea, and elsewhere, for\r\nthe purpose of increasing the list of the known kinds of fishes.\r\n\r\n[2314] B. xxx. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[2315] About 1200 pounds. Cetti, in his “Natural History of Sardinia,”\r\nvol. iii. p. 134, says that tunnies weighing a thousand pounds are far\r\nfrom uncommon, and that they have been taken weighing as much as 1800\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n[2316] The same as the Latin “dodrans,” or about nine inches. This\r\npassage is taken almost verbatim from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. c. 34.\r\nCuvier says that this passage, although like the preceding one, taken\r\nfrom Aristotle, is much more incredible, (though Lacèpede, by the\r\nway, disputes Pliny’s statement as to the weight of the tunny). “A\r\ndistance,” Cuvier says, “of from seven to eight feet from one point of\r\nthe fork of the tail to the other, would denote a fish twenty-five feet\r\nin length; and it must be observed, that most of the MSS. of Pliny say\r\n_two_ cubits.” Aristotle, however, beyond a doubt says _five_.\r\n\r\n[2317] Now universally recognized as the sly silurus, or sheat-fish,\r\ncalled in the United States the horn-pout, the Silurus glanis of\r\nLinnæus. On this formerly much-discussed question, Cuvier has an\r\ninteresting Note. “There can now be no longer any doubt as to the\r\nsilurus; it is evidently synonymous with the ‘glanis’ of Aristotle;\r\nas we find Pliny, in c. 17 and 51, giving the same characteristics of\r\nthe silurus, as Aristotle does of the glanis, Hist. Anim. B. viii.\r\nc. 20, and B. ix. c. 37; such, for instance, as the care it takes\r\nof its young, and the effects produced upon it by the dog-fish and\r\nthe approach of storms. It is easy to prove also that it is not the\r\nsturgeon, [as Hardouin thought it to be], but the fish that is still\r\ncalled ‘silurus’ by the naturalists, the ‘wels’ or ‘schaid’ of the\r\nGermans, the ‘saluth’ of the Swiss, &c.”\r\n\r\n[2318] Cuvier remarks, that it is by no means clear what fish is meant\r\nby this name, which is only found here and once in Hesychius, who\r\ncalls it κητώδης, “of the large kind.” Rondelet, in his account of\r\nriver fish, suggests that “exos” is the proper reading, and that under\r\nthis name is meant a species of sturgeon. Gesner asks if it might not\r\npossibly have been the “brochet;” but, as Cuvier says, that fish was\r\nwell-known to the Romans under the name of “lucius” [our pike], and\r\nit is not sufficiently large for Pliny to compare it to the wels or\r\nthe attilus, and for Hesychius to have enumerated it among the “large”\r\nfishes. It is in accordance, however, with this suggestion of Gesner\r\nthat the pike genus bears the name of “esox” in modern Natural History.\r\n\r\n[2319] Cuvier says that there are found in the river Padus, or Po,\r\nseveral species of very large sturgeons, and that there is one of\r\nthese which still bears the name, according to Salvian and Rondelet,\r\nof adello and adilo. Aldrovandus, he says, calls it adelo or ladano.\r\nThis Cuvier takes to be the attilus of Pliny. But, according to\r\nRezzonico, Paulus Jovius denies that the attilus or _adelus_ of the\r\npeople of Ferrara is of the sturgeon genus; but says that it is so\r\nmuch larger than the sturgeon, and so different in shape, flavour,\r\nvalue, and natural habits, that the names of these two fishes were used\r\nproverbially by the people, when they were desirous to signify two\r\nobjects of totally different nature. Rezzonico remarks, that the name\r\ngiven to it in Ferrara was properly “l’adano,” which became corrupted\r\ninto “ladano,” and expresses it as his opinion that it was the same\r\nwith the esox of the Rhine. He also states, that, from the exceeding\r\nwhiteness of the flesh, the ladano was called by the fishermen,\r\n_sturione bianco_.\r\n\r\n[2320] Rezzonico says that this may possibly have happened in Pliny’s\r\nday, but that in modern times no attilus or ladano is found weighing\r\nmore than 500 pounds. He says that this fish may, in comparison with\r\nthe sturgeon, be aptly called an inert fish; for while the sturgeon\r\nmakes the greatest possible resistance to the fishermen, the other is\r\ntaken with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\n[2321] Cuvier says, that this was probably the Petromyzon branchialis\r\nof Linnæus, the lampillon, a little fish resembling a worm, which\r\nadheres to the gills of other fish, and sucks the blood. The same name\r\nwas also given to the Clupea alosa of Linnæus, our “shad;” indeed\r\nLinnæus gave this name to the whole herring and pilchard genus,\r\nerroneously classing them with the shad.\r\n\r\n[2322] The Main of the present day. But Dalechamps would read “Rheno;”\r\nfor, he says, this river was not known to the ancients by the name of\r\nMœnus.\r\n\r\n[2323] According to Albertus Magnus, this fish, which so strongly\r\nresembled the sea-pig, or porpoise, was the huso, a kind of sturgeon.\r\n\r\n[2324] See B. iv. c. 26. Cuvier says, that the fish here alluded to, is\r\none of the large species of sturgeon, so common in the rivers that fall\r\ninto the Black Sea, the bones of which are cartilaginous, and the flesh\r\nis generally excellent eating.\r\n\r\n[2325] Cuvier says, that this is probably the dolphin of the Ganges; a\r\nfish described by Dr. Roxburgh, in his “Account of Calcutta,” vol. vii.\r\nThis fish, he says, has the muzzle and the tail of the common dolphin;\r\nbut he declines to assert that it attains the length of sixteen cubits.\r\n\r\n[2326] Solinus gives an account of these worms of the Ganges, also from\r\nSebosus, but not exactly to the same effect as Pliny. He says, that\r\nthey are of an azure colour, are _six_ cubits in length, and that they\r\nhave _two arms_. He gives the same account as to their extraordinary\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[2327] It is evident that there is some mistake in the MSS. either\r\nof Solinus or Pliny, as they both copied from the same source. Pliny\r\nspeaks of “branchiæ,” or gills, while Solinus mentions “brachia,”\r\nor arms; the former, however, appears to be the preferable reading.\r\nCuvier remarks that Ctesias, in his Indica, c. 27, has given a similar\r\naccount, but that the worm mentioned by him has two _teeth_, and not\r\n_gills_, and that it only seizes oxen and camels, and not elephants.\r\nHe states also, that an oil was extracted from it, which set on fire\r\neverything that it touched. Cuvier observes, that in most of the MSS.\r\nof Pliny the worm is sixty cubits long, instead of six, as in some few,\r\na length which was quite necessary to enable it to devour an elephant;\r\nand he suggests that some large conger or muræna may have originally\r\ngiven rise to the story. It is by no means improbable that some\r\nindividuals of the boa or python tribe, in the vicinity of the river,\r\nmay have been taken for vast fish or river worms. Among the German\r\ntraditions, we find the name “worm” given to huge serpents, which are\r\nsaid to have spread devastation far and wide; and in the north of\r\nEngland legends about similar “worms,” are by no means uncommon: the\r\nstory about the “Laidly Worm,” in the county of Durham, for instance.\r\n\r\n[2328] Although taken primarily from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c.\r\n9, as Cuvier observes, this assertion is incorrect, as the male does\r\nnot in any way differ from the female in the conformation of the fins.\r\nPliny, however, has exaggerated the statement of Aristotle, who only\r\nsays, that the female differs from the male in having a little fin\r\nunder the belly, which the male has not; and not that the male has no\r\nventral fin whatever.\r\n\r\n[2329] “Magno mari;” meaning, no doubt, the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[2330] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2331] Or “mud-fish,” either from being born in mud, as Festus says, or\r\nfrom their concealing themselves in it.\r\n\r\n[2332] “Clidio.” The “clidion,” or “clidium,” was the part of the fish\r\nwhich extended, as Festus says, from the two shoulders (armos) to the\r\nbreast. The “claviculæ” were thus called by the Greek physicians.\r\n\r\n[2333] The Greeks called the inner part, or black-coloured heart of the\r\noak, μέλαν δρυὸς, whence the present name. Athenæus, B. vi. speaks of\r\nthe choice parts cut from the orcyni, large tunnies, which were taken\r\nin the straits of Gades.\r\n\r\n[2334] “Faucibus.” Cuvier observes, that modern experience has\r\nconfirmed what Pliny says, as to the difference of flavour in these\r\nvarious parts of the tunny. He refers to Cetti, _Ist. Nat. di\r\nSardegna_, vol. iii. p. 137.\r\n\r\n[2335] “Exercitatissima.” “In greatest request, as being most stirred\r\nand exercised,” is the translation given by Holland; while Littré\r\nrenders it “mieux nourries,” “best nourished.” According to the\r\ngeneral notion in this country, the part about the tail is reckoned\r\ninferior, and anything but the “best nourished.” It is doubtful if\r\n“exercitatissima” is the correct reading; and if it is, its precise\r\nmeaning has yet to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n[2336] From the Greek ἀπόλεκτοι, “choice bits,” or, as we should say,\r\n“tit-bits.”\r\n\r\n[2337] From the Greek κύβια.\r\n\r\n[2338] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2339] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2340] This fish does not seem to have been exactly identified till\r\nrecently; but was generally supposed to have been of the tunny genus.\r\nAppian says, that it is rather smaller than the tunny. Rondelet,\r\nB. viii., speaks of it as being, in his time, known by the name of\r\n“byza.” Cuvier has the following remark. “The ‘amia’ of the ancients,\r\nas Rondelet was well aware, was the same fish, to which, incorrectly,\r\nupon nearly all the coasts of the Mediterranean, the name of ‘pelamis’\r\nhas been transferred. It is, in fact, the same as the ‘limosa’ of\r\nSalvianus, the ‘pelamis’ of Belon, the ‘thynnus primus’ of Aldrovandus,\r\nand the ‘scomber sarda’ of Bloch. The proof of all these being\r\nsynonymous, is the fact, that the ‘scomber sarda’ is the only species\r\nof the tunny genus in the Mediterranean, which has strong, sharp,\r\ncutting teeth, and is capable of attacking large fish, which Aristotle\r\nrelates respecting the amia, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 37. The same author\r\ntoo, was well aware of the length of its gall-bladder, which is greater\r\nthan in most other fishes.”\r\n\r\n[2341] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2342] Generally supposed, as Cuvier says, to have been the same as the\r\nmackerel, or Scomber scombrus of Linnæus, and with very fair reason.\r\nFrom the frequent remarks made on the subject by the Roman poets, we\r\nfind that it was a very common fish at Rome, of small size, and was in\r\nlittle repute. It was wrapped in paper when exposed for sale, and bad\r\npoets were threatened with the mackerel, as they are at the present\r\nday with the grocer or butterman; or, as in the time of the Spectator,\r\nwith the trunk-maker. Thus Persius says, Sat. i. l. 43. “and to leave\r\nwritings worthy to be preserved in cedar, and verses that dread neither\r\nmackerel nor frankincense.” Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 2,\r\nenumerates this fish among those that are gregarious, and places it in\r\ncompany with the tunny and the pelamis, but states that it is inferior\r\nin strength, B. viii. c. 2. Cuvier says, that the mackerel still has\r\nnames in different parts that are derived from the word “scomber,”\r\nthey being called “sgombri” at Constantinople, scombri at Venice, and\r\nscurmu, scrumiu, and scumbirro in Sicily.\r\n\r\n[2343] Cetarias. These “cetariæ,” or “cetaria,” Papias says, were\r\npieces of standing salt water, in the vicinity of the sea-shore, in\r\nwhich tunnies and other large fish were kept, and adjoining to which\r\nwere the salting-houses. In the middle ages these preserves were called\r\n“tunnariæ,” or “tunneries.”\r\n\r\n[2344] As in the Euxine. Tunnies were caught on the Spanish coasts, as\r\nwe learn from Athenæus, who, as quoted above, mentions the fisheries\r\noff Gades, for the orcynus, or large tunny. See N. [2333], p. 385.\r\n\r\n[2345] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16, from whom Pliny has here\r\nborrowed, makes a somewhat dissimilar statement. He says that “no\r\nnoxious animal enters the Euxine, except the _phocena_ [_or porpoise_],\r\nand the dolphin and little dolphin.” Hardouin remarks, however, that\r\nPliny is right in his statement that seals are to be found in the\r\nEuxine, and that Rondelet, B. xvi. c. 9, for that reason has suggested\r\nthat the reading ought to be altered in Aristotle, and not in Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2346] Aristotle, B. viii. c. 6. Plutarch on the Instinct of Animals,\r\nand Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 42, say the same.\r\n\r\n[2347] Called “chrysoceras,” in B. iv. c. 18, that being the Greek\r\nname for “golden horn.” He means, that in consequence of the lucrative\r\nnature of this fishery, it thence obtained the name of the “golden”\r\nhorn. Dalechamps is of opinion that some person has here substituted\r\nthe Latin “Aurei cornus,” for the Greek name Chrysoceras.\r\n\r\n[2348] Hence, according to Strabo, Chalcedon obtained the name of the\r\n“City of the Blind,” the people having neglected to choose the opposite\r\nshore for the site of their city. Still, however, a kind of pelamis,\r\nor young tunny, from this place, had the name of “Chalcedonia,” and is\r\nspoken of as a most exquisite dainty by Aulus Gellius, B. vii c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2349] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B.\r\nix.; and Plutarch, in his Treatise on the Instincts of Animals, state\r\nto a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[2350] Cuvier remarks that the “pompilos” of the ancients, which\r\naccompanied ships and left them on nearing the land, was the pilot-fish\r\nof the moderns, the Gasterosteus ductor of Linnæus. He thinks, however,\r\nthat the name may have also been given to other fish as well, of\r\nsimilar habits.\r\n\r\n[2351] Pleuronectes solea of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2352] Pleuronectes maximus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2353] The cuttle-fish. The Sepia officinalis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2354] The ink-fish. The Sepia loligo of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2355] Cuvier suggests that the turdus, or sea-thrush, and the merula,\r\nor sea-blackbird, were both fishes of the labrus tribe, usually known\r\nas “breams.” Hippolytus Salvianus, in his book on the Water Animals,\r\nstates, that in his day—both these fish were extremely well known,\r\nand that they still retained the names of tordo and merlo. Rondelet,\r\nB. vi., says, that the fish anciently called turdus, was in his time\r\nknown by the name of “vielle,” among the French. The dictionaries give\r\n“merling, or whiting,” as the synonyme of “merula.”\r\n\r\n[2356] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16, says, that on going into\r\nthe Euxine, the trichiæ are either taken or else devoured by the other\r\nfishes, for that they are never seen to return.\r\n\r\n[2357] The trichias, according to Cuvier, is a fish belonging to the\r\nfamily of herrings. A scholiast on Aristophanes attributes the origin\r\nof the name to the fine fish bones like hairs (θρὶξ), with which the\r\nflesh is filled, which is a characteristic peculiar to the herring\r\nkind. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 15, represents the membras,\r\nthe trichis, and the trichias, as different ages of the same fish.\r\nThe trichis was little, and very common. In Aristophanes, Knights, l.\r\n662, we find an obol mentioned as the price of a hundred. From the\r\nAcharnæ of the same author, we learn that it was salted as provision\r\nfor the fleets. Cuvier thinks that everything combines to point out\r\nthe sardine, the Clupea sprattus of Linnæus, as the trichis, or else\r\na similar kind of fish, the melette of the African coast, the Clupea\r\nmeletta of the naturalists. In this latter case the trichias, he\r\nthinks, may have been the sardine, or, perhaps, the Clupea ficta of\r\nLacèpede, which is called the “sardine” in some places, and at Lake\r\nGarda, in Lombardy, more especially.\r\n\r\n[2358] The Danube. Cuvier says, that this passage probably bears\r\nreference to the clupea ficta or finte, which, as well as the shad,\r\nis in the habit of passing up streams. As for the story of the fish\r\nfinding their way to the Adriatic, it is utterly without foundation.\r\nCuvier adds, that the main difference between the finte and the clupea\r\nalosa, or shad, is, that the former has very fine teeth, the latter\r\nnone at all.\r\n\r\n[2359] Pliny has already remarked, B. iii. c. 18, in reference to the\r\nsupposed descent of the Argonauts from the Ister into the Adriatic,\r\nthat such a passage by water was totally impossible; hence, as Hardouin\r\nsays, he is obliged here to have recourse to subterraneous passages.\r\n\r\n[2360] The Pleiades. See B. ii. c. 47. The rising of the Pleiades was\r\nconsidered the beginning of summer, being the forty-eighth day after\r\nthe vernal equinox. See also B. xviii. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[2361] The evening setting, namely. This took place on the fourth day\r\nbefore the nones of November. See B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2362] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2363] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 16. Hardouin remarks, that the\r\ntunny which Pliny mentions in c. 17, as weighing so many hundreds of\r\npounds, must certainly have been older than this.\r\n\r\n[2364] This is, as Cuvier has remarked, a crustaceous insect of the\r\nparasitical class Lernæa, which are monoculous [and form the modern\r\nclass of the Epizoa]. Gmelin, he says, has called it “Pennatula\r\nfilosa,” though, in fact, it is not a pennatula [or polyp] at all. As\r\nDalechamps observes, its appearance is very different from that of a\r\nscorpion. Penetrating the flesh of the tunny or sword-fish, it almost\r\ndrives the creature to a state of madness.\r\n\r\n[2365] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 19. Appian also, in his\r\nHalieutics, B. ii., makes mention of this animal. Pintianus remarks,\r\nthat Athenæus, on reading this passage of Aristotle, read it not as\r\n“arachnes,” but “drachmes;” not the size of a spider, but the weight of\r\na “drachma,” or Roman denarius.\r\n\r\n[2366] Or the emperor fish, Cuvier says, the Xiphias gladius of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2367] In confirmation of this, Suetonius says, “The day before\r\nAugustus fought the sea-battle off Sicily, while he was walking on the\r\nsea-shore, a fish leapt out of the sea and fell at his feet.”\r\n\r\n[2368] Appian tells us, B. v., that Sextus Pompeius, on gaining some\r\nsuccesses against Augustus at sea, caused himself to be called the “Son\r\nof Neptune,” as having been adopted by that divinity. There is also a\r\ncoin of Pompey extant, which attests that he adopted the surname of\r\n“Neptunius.”\r\n\r\n[2369] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 5. Cuvier remarks, that this is\r\ntrue, and more especially during the spawning season.\r\n\r\n[2370] Aristotle says the same, but with the expression of some doubt\r\nas to the truth of the assertion. B. vi. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[2371] The erythinus is supposed to be the roach, or rochet, of\r\nthe present day, and the channe, the ruff or perch. Ovid, in his\r\nHalieuticon, l. 107, alludes to the same notion that is here mentioned:\r\n“And the channe, that reproduces itself, deprived of two-fold parents.”\r\nCuvier remarks, that, wonderful as these assertions may be, they are\r\nnot devoid, to all appearance, of a certain foundation; for that\r\nCavolini has observed in the Perca cabrilla and Perca scriba of\r\nLinnæus, a species of hermaphroditism; the ovary having always in the\r\ninterior a lobe, which, from its conformation, would appear to be for\r\nthe milt; and that he is strongly of opinion that in this species, and\r\nsome others of the same genus, all the fish produce eggs, and fecundate\r\nthem themselves.\r\n\r\n[2372] Cuvier says, that the channe is the Perca cabrilla of Linnæus,\r\none of the serrans or trumpet-fish of the coasts of Provence. According\r\nto Forskal, _Fauna Arabica_, and Sonnini, it still has the name among\r\nthe Turks and modern Greeks, of “chani,” or “channo,” and it was in\r\nthese that Cavolini observed the singular organization previously\r\nmentioned. According to Athenæus, B. vii., Aristotle has described this\r\nfish as of a red colour, variegated with black rays, which answers very\r\nwell to the Perca scriba of Linnæus, approaching most nearly to the\r\nPerca cabrilla.\r\n\r\n[2373] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 75.\r\n\r\n[2374] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2375] Aristotle makes the same remark, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2376] Cuvier observes, that all fishes are found to have in the\r\nmembranous labyrinth of the ear, bodies like stone, enclosed in a\r\ncertain kind of gelatinous liquor. These bodies, however, he says,\r\nare not equally large in all kinds of fish. He says that it is found\r\nlargest in the sciæna.\r\n\r\n[2377] The Perca labrax of Linnæus. Called “loup,” or “wolf,” on the\r\nMediterranean coasts of France, and “bar” on the shores of the ocean.\r\n\r\n[2378] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 19, attributes to the\r\nchromis, Cuvier says, stones in the head, B. iv. c. 8, an acute\r\nhearing, B. iv. c. 9, the power of making a sort of grunting noise,\r\nand the habit of living gregariously, and depositing the eggs once\r\na year, B. iv. c. 9; all which characteristics, he says, are found\r\nin the Sciæna umbra of the naturalists, the maigre of the French. In\r\naddition to this, Epicharmus, as quoted by Athenæus, B. vii., says\r\nthat the chromis and the xiphias are, at the beginning of spring, the\r\nvery best of fish; a quality which must be admitted to belong to the\r\nmaigre, for its size and its excellent flavour. However, he says,\r\nseeing that the glaucus, which Aristotle has distinguished from the\r\nchromis, has a still stronger resemblance to the maigre, and that, as\r\nBelon informs us, the ombrine, or Sciæna cirrhosa, is still sometimes\r\ncalled at Marseilles the “chro,” or the “chrau,” and that, as Gyllius\r\nsays, on the coast of Genoa it has the name of “chro,” it would not\r\nbe improbable that this is really the chromis of the Greeks, as Belon\r\nsupposes.\r\n\r\n[2379] From σκιὰ, the Greek for “shadow;” which name, as Cuvier says,\r\nhas been translated by the moderns by the word “ombre,” or “umbra.”\r\nBut this name has been given at the present day to so many fish of\r\nvarious kinds, from the “ombra” of the Italians and the “maigre” of\r\nthe French, the Sciæna umbra of the naturalists, the ombrine or Sciæna\r\ncirrhosa of Linnæus, to the ombre of Auvergne, the Salmo thymallus of\r\nLinnæus, and the ombre chevalier, the Salmo umbra of Linnæus, that this\r\nsynonyme does not aid us in discovering its identity. Aristotle says\r\nnothing relative to his sciæna, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 19, except\r\nthat it has stones in the head, a thing that is common to this with\r\nmany other fish. Pliny, in copying this passage, preserves the Greek\r\nname; but Ovid, Columella, and Ausonius give it the name of “umbra;”\r\nthe one, however, described by the first two is a sea-fish, while that\r\nof Ausonius is a fresh-water fish. Varro, who cites the name of umbra\r\namong those given to fish, adds that the species which bears it owes\r\nits name to its peculiar colour; and as Ovid calls it “liveus,” or\r\n“livid,” it may be presumed to have been of a dark colour. It is very\r\npossible, then, that it may have been the corvus marinus, or sea-crow,\r\nthe Sciæna nigra of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2380] Or pagrus. This passage is from Aristotle, Hist. Nat. B. viii.\r\nc. 19. Cuvier says that there are several names of fish, known in\r\nthe Mediterranean at the present day, as being from the φάγρος of\r\nAristotle, such as the pagri or pageau, the fragolino, &c. names of a\r\nfish of a red silvery hue, the Sparus erythrinus of Linnæus, his Sparus\r\npagrus being another species. The modern Greeks also call it φάγρος,\r\nthe best proof of its identity with the phagros of Aristotle, or pager\r\nor phagrus of Pliny. This phagrus, Cuvier says, was not improbably the\r\nsame as the modern pagre, as their characteristics quite agree, so far\r\nas those of the ancient phagrus are described. It is of red colour, and\r\nwe find Ovid (Halieut. l. 108,) speaking of the “rutilus pagur,” and it\r\nwas, according to Aristotle, B. viii. c. 13, caught equally out at sea\r\nand near the shore, and had stones in the head, B. viii. c. 19, or, in\r\nother words, stony bodies of large size in the labyrinthine cavities of\r\nthe ear. Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. l. 185, says that the channe forms a\r\ndelicate morsel for the pagrus, which shows that it was of considerable\r\nsize; and several authors quoted by Athenæus, B. vii., give it the\r\nepithet of “great.” Hicesius says, in the same place, that it resembles\r\nthe erythrus, the chromis, the anthias, and other fish of very\r\ndifferent character among themselves; but it is only in relation to the\r\nflesh that he makes these comparisons, so that we are unable to come\r\nto any conclusion as to the form. But we find Numenius, also quoted\r\nby Athenæus, speaking of the φάγρον λοφίην, the “crested phagrus,”\r\npossibly in allusion to the height of the neck. The properties of its\r\nflesh are, if possible, still less characteristic. Hicesius says that\r\nit is of sweet flavour and nourishing, but rather astringent. Galen,\r\nhowever, says that it is hard, and difficult of digestion, when old.\r\nArchestratus looks upon its head as a delicacy, but thinks so little\r\nof the other parts, that they are not, in his opinion, worth carrying\r\naway. He was, however, well known to be much too refined in his notions\r\nof epicurism.\r\n\r\n[2381] Hardouin says that Aristotle, B. viii. c. 20, from whom this\r\naccount is taken, does not say this of all kinds of fish, but only of\r\nthose which have large heads.\r\n\r\n[2382] In B. viii. c. 54 and 55, where he is speaking of bears and\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\n[2383] Cuvier states that Pliny takes this name from Aristotle, and\r\nthat Athenæus, B. vii., says that it is synonymous with the Greek\r\nname, κορύφαινη. He also informs us, that modern naturalists have\r\napplied these two names to the dorade of navigators, the lampuga of the\r\nSpaniards and Sicilians, the Coryphæna hippurus of Linnæus, but that it\r\nis not clear that it has been applied on sufficient grounds: as there\r\nis no trace whatever of either of the two ancient names on the coasts\r\nof the Mediterranean, and the ancient writers have given no sufficient\r\ncharacteristics of the coryphæna or hippurus. It was, we learn, of\r\nexcellent flavour, and in the habit of springing out of the water, from\r\nwhich, Athenæus says, it received the name of “arneutes,” from ἀρνὸς,\r\n“a lamb.”\r\n\r\n[2384] Cuvier remarks, that Rondelet and others of the moderns have\r\nthought that this was synonymous with the crow-fish, the corb of the\r\nFrench, the Sciæna nigra of Linnæus, but that his own researches on the\r\nsubject had led him to a different conclusion. Its name was derived,\r\nhe says, from the Greek κόραξ, “a crow,” on account of the blackness\r\nof its colour, as Oppian says, Halieut. B. i. l. 133; but there were\r\nwhite ones as well, which Athenæus, B. viii., says, were the best\r\neating, though the black ones were the most common. Aristophanes, as\r\nquoted by Athenæus, B. viii., calls it also the fish with black gills,\r\nμελανοπτέρυγον. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 10, says that it was a\r\nsmall fish, and one of those that increase rapidly in growth. It was\r\nlittle esteemed, and was much used, as we learn from Athenæus and the\r\nGeoponica, for salting, and making garum or fish-sauce. It was also\r\nused as a bait for the anthias or flower-fish. Strabo, B. xiii., also\r\nspeaks of a river-fish of this name, as being found in the Nile; the\r\nflesh of which Athenæus mentions as being remarkably good eating, and\r\nthe best among the fishes of the Nile. Martial also, B. xiii. Ep. 85,\r\ncalls it “princeps Niliaci macelli,” the “prince of the produce of the\r\nNile.” That fish, however, Pliny says, B. xxxii. c. 5, was peculiar to\r\nthe Nile; and he states, B. v. c. 9, that in consequence of finding it\r\nin a lake of Lower Mauritania, Juba pretended that the Nile took its\r\nrise in that lake. Athenæus says, B. iii., that the dwellers on the\r\nNile called it πέλτη, “the buckler;” and in B. vii., that the people of\r\nAlexandria called it πλάταξ, from its broad shape. Now, Cuvier remarks,\r\nit is well known that the best fish of the Nile at the present day is\r\nthe bolty, the Labrus Niloticus of Linnæus, and the Chromis Nilotica of\r\nhis own system; and this he takes to be the Coracinus albus. It is flat\r\nand compressed, and when held on the side, would appear almost circular\r\nin shape. Its colour appears white in comparison with that of another\r\nlittle fish of the same genus, the Sparus chromis of Linnæus, the\r\nChromis castanea of Cuvier, which is of a brownish colour, and is found\r\non the coast of France, where it has never been held in high esteem,\r\nexcept for the purposes of salting or making bait for other fish. He\r\nconcludes, then, that this last was the sea coracinus, and the “bolty”\r\nof the present day that of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[2385] Cuvier says, that it has been doubted, upon the authority of\r\nPaulus Jovius, whether by this name was signified the muræna of the\r\npresent day, the Muræna helena of Linnæus, or the Petromizon marinus of\r\nLinnæus, the modern lamprey. These two fishes, he says, have in common\r\na long smooth body, and are devoid of the symmetrical fins, and the\r\nflesh of both is of a delicate flavour. There are, however, several\r\nother characteristics mentioned, he says, from which it can be easily\r\nproved that in most of the passages of Pliny, Aristotle, and Ælian,\r\nwhere the muræna is mentioned, it is the Muræna helena that is meant.\r\nOvid says, Halieut. ll. 114, 115, “the muræna burning with its spots\r\nof gold”—but the lamprey has no yellow spots whatever: and in l. 27,\r\nhe speaks of it as “ferox,” or “fierce,” a characteristic which also\r\nbelongs to the muræna, but not to the lamprey. Ælian also states, B.\r\nx. c. 40, that the muræna defends itself with its teeth, which form\r\na double row, and Aristotle says, B. viii. c. 2, that it lives upon\r\nflesh; while Pliny says, in c. 88 of the present Book, that it bites\r\noff the tail of the conger. It was the Muræna helena only, and not the\r\nlamprey, that could have devoured the slaves whom Vedius Pollio ordered\r\nto be thrown into their preserves, as is mentioned by our author in the\r\npresent Book, and by Seneca and Tertullian. Finally, a thing that he\r\nconsiders quite decisive on the point, Aristotle says, B. ii. c. 13,\r\nthat the muræna has four gills on each side, like the eel; while the\r\nfact is that the lamprey has only seven in all. Where we find Pliny\r\nspeaking of the seven spots upon the muræna found in Northern Gaul, it\r\nappears most likely, Cuvier says, that he speaks after some traveller,\r\nwho had observed the seven branchial orifices on the lamprey, and had\r\ntaken them for spots.\r\n\r\n[2386] This fish, Cuvier says, was of a reddish colour, had rough\r\nscales, sharp teeth, large eyes, and a tough flesh. It lived a solitary\r\nlife in the sea, near rocks which were the resort of shell-fish, which\r\nformed its principal nutriment. It passed the winter in the crevices of\r\nrocks under water. Its growth was rapid, and the length of its life two\r\nyears; when cut in pieces, its muscles, were still seen to palpitate.\r\nRondelet, having gathered these characteristics, looks upon the orphus\r\nas belonging to the genus Pagrus. Cuvier says, however, that it would\r\nnot be easy to prove that this is a warranted conclusion, and that it\r\nis not justified by tradition, as the name has utterly disappeared\r\nfrom the coasts of France and Italy; though, according to Gillius\r\nand Belon, it is found among the modern Greeks, in the shape of the\r\n“ropho.” Cuvier suggests that it may have been the Anthias sacer of\r\nBloch, the “barbier” of the French.—It is supposed by some that it is\r\nour “gilt-head.”\r\n\r\n[2387] The Muræna conger of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2388] “Percæ.” Cuvier says that it is most probable that he is here\r\nspeaking of the fish generally known by the ancients as the sea-perch;\r\nand that there is reason for thinking that it was similar to the\r\nPerca scriba of Linnæus, having black lines running across the body.\r\nMost naturalists are of this opinion, he says, and the serran [our\r\ntrumpet-fish] which bears this resemblance, is in many parts of Italy,\r\nat the present day, called the “Percia marina.”\r\n\r\n[2389] The Raia torpedo of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2390] Cuvier states, that Athenæus, B. vii., says that the psetta\r\nwas the same as the rhombus of the Romans, the modern turbot,\r\nthe Pleuronectes maximus of Linnæus. From a passage, however, of\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 37, he feels convinced that it is the\r\nPleuronectes rhombus of Linnæus, the barbue of the French, and with\r\nus the dab or sandling. Aristotle says in that passage, that it is in\r\nthe habit of concealing itself in the sand, while it moves to and fro\r\nthe filaments around the mouth, and so attracts the little fish. These\r\nfilaments, Cuvier says, are small radii of the anterior part of the\r\ndorsal fin, which form a sort of fringe around the mouth, whence its\r\nFrench name of barbue. The turbot has no such filaments.\r\n\r\n[2391] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 20. As Hardouin remarks,\r\nAristotle appears to assign the sixty days to the glaucus only.\r\n\r\n[2392] Naturalists have generally supposed, following Rondelet, Cuvier\r\nsays, that the ancient glaucus was one of the class of centronotal\r\nfishes, the Scomber amia, or the Scomber glaucus of Linnæus; but that\r\nthe incorrectness of this notion is easily proved. Aristotle says, that\r\nin the glaucus the appendices to the pylorus are few in number, as in\r\nthe dorado (the Sparus aurata of Linnæus), while on the other hand the\r\ncentronoti have them in almost greater number than any other kind of\r\nfish. Athenæus says, B. iii., that the glaucus was a large fish, and\r\nOppian, Hal. iii. l. 193, speaks of it as taken with mullet. Aristotle,\r\nB. ii. c. 13, says, that it dwelt in deep water; but, according to\r\nOppian, Hal. i. 170, it sought its food among rocks and in the sand;\r\nin addition to which characteristics, we find that it was a fish\r\nhighly esteemed as a delicacy, the head being the part more especially\r\npreferred. From all these circumstances, Cuvier concludes that it was\r\nmore probably a maigre, the Sciæna aquila of Cuvier, than one of the\r\ncentronotal fishes.\r\n\r\n[2393] Literally, the “little ass.” Cuvier says, that nearly all the\r\nnaturalists, following Rondelet, apply this name to the merlus, the\r\nGadus merluccius of Linnæus, or else the genus of the gadus, or cod,\r\nin general. It is true, he says, that the “onos,” or “ass” of the\r\nGreeks, the “asellus” of the Romans, was also known as the γαδὸς, by\r\nthe Greeks; but still this onos had very different characteristics\r\nfrom those of the Gadus merluccius; and among all the gadi of Linnæus,\r\nhe finds the only one that presents any of them to be the Gadus\r\ntricirrhatus, or sea-weasel, which he therefore thinks to represent the\r\nancient “asellus.”\r\n\r\n[2394] Aurata, “golden-fish.” Cuvier observes, that by the Greeks this\r\nwas called χρύσοφρυς, “eye-brow of gold.” It is the French daurade of\r\nthe Mediterranean, the “Sparus aurata” of Linnæus, and is remarkable\r\nfor a golden line in form of a crescent over the eyes. Ajasson remarks,\r\nthat it was also called Ἰώνισκος, and suggests that it may have been\r\noriginally called so from being first found in the Ionian Sea. From\r\nan epigram of Martial, B. xiii. Ep. 110, it would appear that this\r\nfish was considered a very great dainty, and that it was fattened with\r\nLucrine oysters.\r\n\r\n[2395] This fish has been already mentioned in c. 17 of the present\r\nBook. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 20, says this of the glanis.\r\n\r\n[2396] Further mention is made of this fish in c. 74 of the present\r\nBook. Aristotle mentions it in B. viii. c. 25, but says nothing about\r\nit being a sea-fish; while Dorion, as quoted by Athenæus, B. vii.,\r\nexpressly mentions it among the lake and river fish. Hence Dalechamps\r\nseems inclined to censure our author for this addition; but we find\r\nOppian, Halieut. B. i. ll. 101 and 592, speaking of the sea cyprinus;\r\nand Athenæus speaks of the cyprinus of Aristotle as being a sea-fish.\r\n\r\n[2397] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 20. This subject is also\r\ntreated of by Pliny in B. ii. c. 40, and is again mentioned in B.\r\nxviii. c. 58.\r\n\r\n[2398] Cuvier remarks, that it does not appear that the characteristics\r\nof the mullet, here mentioned by Pliny, have been observed in modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[2399] The same story is told of the ostrich.\r\n\r\n[2400] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 4, states to a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[2401] Cuvier says, that the peculiarity in the scales here mentioned\r\nis not found in any fish; but that the sturgeon genus has, in place of\r\nscales, laminæ disposed in longitudinal lines in such a way, that the\r\none does not lap over the other, as is the case with fish in general.\r\nIt was this fact, misstated probably, that gave rise to the story; and\r\nit is most likely this that has led Rondelet, and most of the modern\r\nnaturalists, to look upon the acipenser as the common sturgeon, and\r\nto give that name to the sturgeon genus. Athenæus reckons it among\r\nthe cartilaginous fishes, and in the family of the squali; but Pliny\r\nhere speaks of it as very rare, and Martial and Cicero say the same,\r\nwhich cannot be so accurately said of the sturgeon. Archestratus, in\r\nAthenæus, speaks of it as small, having a sharp-pointed muzzle, and of\r\ntriangular shape, and tells us that a very inferior one was valued at\r\n1000 Attic drachmæ. The sturgeon, on the other hand, is often ten or\r\ntwelve feet in length. The acipenser was not always in vogue with the\r\nRomans, but when it was, it was most highly esteemed; and according to\r\nAthenæus, B. vii., and Sammonicus Severus, as quoted by Macrobius, B.\r\nii. c. 12, it was brought to table by servants crowned with flowers\r\nand preceded by a piper. All these circumstances lead Cuvier to be of\r\nopinion that under this name is meant a kind of small sturgeon with a\r\nsharp muzzle, greatly esteemed by the Russians, and by them known as\r\nthe sterlet, the Acipenser Ruthenus of Linnæus, the Acipenser Pygmæus\r\nof Pallas. It is found in the Black Sea, and in the rivers that fall\r\ninto it; and has been carried with success to Lake Ladoga, as also\r\nLake Meler, in Sweden. This is the smallest and most delicate of the\r\nsturgeon genus, and Professor Pallas says that they are sold at St.\r\nPetersburgh at “insane prices,” when more than two feet in length. It\r\nis not improbable that it was found in the rivers of Asia Minor, and\r\nthence carried to Rome occasionally. Pliny, indeed, B. xxxiii. c. 11,\r\nsays that it is not a stranger to Italy; if so, it would seem to be\r\ndifferent from the “elops,” of which Ovid says, Halieut. l. 96, “and\r\nthe precious elops, unknown in our waters,” though he also says of\r\nthe “acipenser,” in l. 132, “and thou, acipenser, famed in distant\r\nwaters.” Still, however, Cuvier says, the use of names was not so\r\naccurate among the ancients, but what that of “acipenser” may have\r\nbeen given to the sturgeon in general; and this may have given rise to\r\nthe present assertions of Pliny. Oppian, in Athenæus, B. vii., says,\r\nlike Pliny, that the elops was the same as the acipenser, and we find\r\nno characteristics given of the elops to make us conclude that the\r\ntwo were not synonymous. Indeed, we find that Varro, De Re Rustica,\r\nB. ii. c. 6, and Pliny in c. 54 of the present Book, speak of the\r\nelops as being most excellent at Rhodes, while we find Archestratus in\r\nAthenæus, B. vii., speaking of the same as being the locality of the\r\nacipenser; and Columella, B. viii. c. 16, and Ælian, B. viii. c. 28,\r\nplace it in the Pamphylian Sea, which is not far distant from Rhodes.\r\nPliny, B. xxxii. c. 11, states, that the palm of fine flavour was by\r\nmany accorded to the elops; while Matron Parodus, in Athenæus, calls\r\nit the “most noble of all fishes, food worthy of the gods.” From the\r\nimmense sums that were given for it, as we learn from Varro, quoted by\r\nNonius Marcellus, it was called the “multum munus,” or “multinummus,”\r\nthe “much-money fish.” Ælian says, B. viii. c. 28, that the fishermen\r\nwho were fortunate enough to take an elops, were in the habit of\r\ncrowning themselves and their vessel with garlands, and announcing it,\r\non entering harbour, by the sound of the trumpet. Professor Pallas,\r\nin his work on the Russian Zoography, takes the elops to be a kind of\r\nsturgeon, more spiny than the rest, which is represented by Marsigli\r\nunder the name of “Huso sextus.” He does not, however, give his reason\r\nfor fixing on this as the elops of the ancients. It has been also\r\nsuggested that the elops was the same as the sword-fish.\r\n\r\n[2402] The wolf-fish. Generally supposed to be the basse, or lubin of\r\nthe French, much esteemed for their delicacy.\r\n\r\n[2403] See N. [1966] above.\r\n\r\n[2404] Cuvier remarks, that we find this name in Euthydemus, as quoted\r\nby Athenæus, B. vii., used synonymously with that of “onos.” We also\r\nfind the names Callarias, Galerias, and Galerides; but none of the\r\ncharacteristics are given, by which to distinguish them.\r\n\r\n[2405] Cuvier says that this fish held, as Pliny here states, the\r\nvery highest place at the Roman tables, and was especially famous:\r\nFirst, because it was supposed to ruminate; in allusion to which, Ovid\r\nsays, Halieut. l. 118, “But, on the other hand, some fishes extend\r\nthemselves on the sands covered with weeds, as the scarus, which\r\nfish alone ruminates the food it has eaten.” Secondly, because, as\r\nAristotle, B. viii. c. 2, and Ælian, B. i. c. 2, inform us, it lived\r\nsolely on vegetables. Thirdly, because it had the faculty of producing\r\na sound, as we learn from Oppian, Halieut. B. i. l. 134, and Suidas.\r\nFourthly, for its salacious propensities, numbers being taken by means\r\nof a female attached to a string. Oppian, Halieut. B. iv. l. 78, and\r\nÆlian, B. i. c. 2. Fifthly, for its remarkable sagacity in affording\r\nassistance to another, when taken in the net; relative to which Ovid\r\nhas the following curious passage, Halieut. l. 9, _et seq._ “The scarus\r\nis caught by stratagem beneath the waves, and at length dreads the\r\nbait fraught with treachery. It dares not strike the osiers with an\r\neffort of its head; but, turning away, as it loosens the twigs with\r\nfrequent blows of its tail, it makes its passage, and escapes safely\r\ninto the deep. Moreover, if perchance any kind scarus, swimming behind,\r\nsees it struggling within the osiers, he takes hold of its tail in his\r\nmouth, as it is thus turned away, and so it makes its escape.” Oppian,\r\nHalieut. B. iv. l. 40, and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 4, mention the\r\nsame circumstance. We find that it was highly esteemed by the Roman\r\nepicures, even in early times, it being mentioned by Ennius and Horace.\r\nIt was salted with the intestines in it; and Martial, B. xiii. Ep. 84,\r\nseems to speak of it as not being good to eat without them. It was\r\na high-coloured fish, so much so, that Marcellus Sidetes called it\r\n“floridum,” while by Oppian it is called ποικίλον, or “variegated.”\r\nRondelet thinks that it was one of spari or the labri, while Belon\r\ndescribes as such, a fish now unknown to zoologists, the tail of which,\r\nhe says, has projecting spines. Aldrovandus calls it by the name of\r\nScarus Cretensis, a species of the genus which at present goes by\r\nthe name of Scarus, and which is distinguished by osseous jaw-bones,\r\nresembling in shape the beak of a parrot. Cuvier says, that on finding\r\nfrom Belon that the name σκάρος was still in use in the Ægean Sea, he\r\nordered the various kinds of it to be brought to Paris; upon which he\r\nfound that they exactly resembled the Scarus Cretensis of Aldrovandus,\r\nand he consequently has no doubt that it is essentially the same fish\r\nas the scarus of the Greeks and Romans. From the resemblance above\r\nstated, it is not uncommonly called the “parrot-fish;” while by some it\r\nhas been thought to have resembled our char.\r\n\r\n[2406] See B. v. cc. 32, 41.\r\n\r\n[2407] Or weasel-fish. Cuvier is of opinion that Hardouin is right in\r\nhis conjecture, that this is the Lote, or Gadus lota of Linnæus, which\r\nis still called motelle in some of the provinces of France. Its liver,\r\nhe says, is one of the greatest delicacies that can be eaten.\r\n\r\n[2408] The present Boden See, or Lake of Constance.\r\n\r\n[2409] Instead of “marinis,” Sillig adopts the reading “murænis,”\r\nmaking them to rival the muræna even. The other, however, seems to be\r\nthe preferable reading.\r\n\r\n[2410] Cuvier says that this is the τρίγλα of the Greeks, the triglia\r\nof modern Italy, the rouget of Provence, and the Mullus barbatus of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[2411] The coasts of La Manche, Cuvier says, and the Gulf of Gascony\r\nproduce a kind of mullet of larger size than usual, varied with stripes\r\nof a yellow colour. This, the Mullus surmuletus of Linnæus, is also to\r\nbe found in the Mediterranean, but much more rarely than the smaller\r\nkind, which is red all over.\r\n\r\n[2412] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ii.\r\nc. 41; and Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. l. 435.\r\n\r\n[2413] Hardouin says that it is larger than the sea-mullet; and that it\r\ndwells in muddy or slimy spots in the vicinity of the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n[2414] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2415] Probably from the fact of its living in the mud. “Doctors\r\ndiffer” on this point. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16, says\r\nthat shore-fish are superior to those caught out at sea; while Seneca,\r\non the other hand, Nat. Quæst. B. iii. c. 18, says that rock-fish and\r\nthose caught out at sea are the best.\r\n\r\n[2416] He would almost seem to imply by this that they feed upon\r\nshell-fish: but Hardouin has a note to the effect, that Pliny does not\r\nmean that they live on shell-fish, as it would be impossible for them\r\nto break the shell to devour the fish within, but only that they have\r\nthe same flavour as shell-fish. But query as to this explanation.\r\n\r\n[2417] On the other hand, Isidorus says that the mullet-coloured shoes\r\nwere so called from the colour of the fish, which, indeed, is most\r\nprobable. These shoes were made of a kind of red Parthian leather,\r\nprobably not unlike our morocco leather. Festus seems to say that\r\nthey were worn in general by all the patricians; but the passage of\r\nVarro which he quotes, only shows that they were worn by the curule\r\nmagistrates, the consul, prætor, and curule ædile.\r\n\r\n[2418] Hence their Greek name, τρίγλα, according to Oppian, Halieut. B.\r\ni. l. 590.\r\n\r\n[2419] Seneca has a passage on this subject, Quæst. Nat. B. iii. c. 18,\r\nwhich strongly bespeaks the barbarous tastes of the Romans. He says: “A\r\nmullet even, if just caught, is thought little of, unless it is allowed\r\nto die in the hand of your guest. They are carried about enclosed in\r\nglobes of glass, and their colour is watched as they die, which is\r\nchanged by the struggles of death into various shades and hues.” And\r\nagain: “There is nothing, you say, more beautiful than the colours of\r\nthe dying mullet; as it struggles and breathes forth its life, it is\r\nfirst purple, and then a paleness gradually comes over it; and then,\r\nplaced as it is between life and death, an uncertain hue comes over it.”\r\n\r\n[2420] This anchovy, pickle, or fish-sauce, will be found more fully\r\nspoken of in B. xxxi. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[2421] Alecem. See B. xxxi. c. 44. Seneca speaks of this cruel custom\r\nof pickling fish alive, Quæst. Nat. B. iii. c. 17. “Other fish, again,\r\nthey kill in sauces, and pickle them alive. There are some persons who\r\nlook upon it as quite incredible that a fish should be able to live\r\nunder-ground. How much more so would it appear to them, if they were\r\nto hear of a fish swimming in sauce, and that the chief dish of the\r\nbanquet was killed at the banquet, feeding the eye before it does the\r\ngullet?”\r\n\r\n[2422] He may have been the son of C. Asinius Gallus, who was consul\r\nB.C. 8; but he does not appear to have ever been consul himself.\r\n\r\n[2423] The reign of the Emperor Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2424] Juvenal, Sat. iv. l. 15, speaks of a mullet being bought for\r\n6000 sesterces, a thousand for every pound, and Suetonius tells us that\r\nin the reign of Tiberius three mullets were sold for 30,000 sesterces.\r\nIt is in allusion to this kind of extravagance that Juvenal says, in\r\nthe same Satire, that it is not unlikely that the fisherman could be\r\nbought as a slave for a smaller sum than the fish itself. At the above\r\nrate, each of these mullets sold for about £70 of our money.\r\n\r\n[2425] Cuvier says that although the mullet of the Indian Seas is in\r\ngeneral larger than ours, it is never found at all approaching the\r\nweight here mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2426] The bolty of the modern Egyptians, as previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2427] Or Jove-fish. Cuvier says that Gillius has “applied the name\r\nof “faber” to the dory, or fish of Saint Peter, and has stated that\r\nthe Dalmatians, who call it the “forga,” pretend that they can find\r\nin its bones all the instruments of a forge. After him, other modern\r\nnaturalists have called the same fish Zeus faber; but nothing, Cuvier\r\nsays, goes to prove that the dory is the fish so called by the\r\nancients. The epithet even of “rare,” given to it by Ovid, Halieut.\r\nl. 112, is far from applicable to the dory, which is common enough\r\nin the Mediterranean. If, indeed, the χαλκεὺς of the Greeks were the\r\nsame as the “faber,” as, indeed, we have reason to suppose, it would\r\nbe something in favour of the dory, as Athenæus, B. vii., says that\r\nthe χαλκεὺς is of a round shape: but then, on the other hand, Oppian,\r\nHalieut. B. v. l. 135, ranks it among the rock-fish which feed near\r\nrocks with herbage on them; while the dory is found only in the deep\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[2428] Or “blacksmith.”\r\n\r\n[2429] Cuvier says that this fish has still the same name in Italy;\r\nthat it is called the “saupe” in Provence, and the “vergadelle” in\r\nLanguedoc, being the Sparus salpa of Linnæus; and that it still answers\r\nto all the ancient characteristics of the salpa, eating grass and\r\nfilling its stomach, and having numerous red lines upon the body. It is\r\ncommon, and bad eating, but is no better at Ivica, the ancient Ebusus,\r\nthan anywhere else. M. De la Roche, when describing the fishes of that\r\nisland, says expressly that the flesh of the saupe is but very little\r\nesteemed there. Ovid, Halieut. l. 122, speaks of it as “deservedly held\r\nin little esteem.”\r\n\r\n[2430] See B. iii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2431] Neither at Ebusus nor anywhere else.\r\n\r\n[2432] Hardouin remarks, that Pliny and Ausonius are the only Latin\r\nwriters that mention this fish; while not one among the Greeks speaks\r\nof it. It was probably a native of regions too far to the north for\r\nthem to know much about it. In this country it holds the same rank that\r\nthe scarus and the mullet seem to have held at the Roman tables.\r\n\r\n[2433] He must mean _single_ ones, on each side of the head. Cuvier\r\nremarks, that the present passage is from a longer one in Aristotle,\r\nHist. Anim. B. ii. c. 13, which, however, has come down to us in such a\r\ncorrupt and fragmentary state, that it is totally unintelligible, or,\r\nat all events, does not correspond with modern experience. No fish,\r\nhe says, is known to us that has one or two gills only. The Lophii of\r\nthe system of Linnæus have three gills on each side, and the greater\r\nnumber of fish four, with a half one attached to the opercule. Some\r\ncartilaginous fish, again, have five or six, and the lampreys seven.\r\n\r\n[2434] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iii. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[2435] The modern Lago di Como, and Lago Maggiore. See B. iii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[2436] See c. 20, as to the Vergiliæ.\r\n\r\n[2437] Cuvier says, that in various species of the cyprinus, and more\r\nespecially the rubellio, the Cyprinus rutilus of Linnæus, the roach,\r\nthe Cyprinus jeses of Linnæus, and the bream, the Cyprinus brama\r\nof Linnæus, the male has, during the spawning season, little warts\r\nadhering to the skin and scales. This appearance has been remarked in\r\nespecial on a species found in the lakes of Lombardy, known there as\r\nthe “pigo,” and similar to the roach of other countries. It is most\r\nprobable that it is to this appearance that Pliny alludes. Rondelet, in\r\nhis book on Fishes, gives a representation of it, and calls it “pigus,”\r\nor “cyprinus clavatus;” but he wrongly, like Pliny, takes it to be a\r\npeculiar genus of fish.\r\n\r\n[2438] “Clavorum caligarium”—“nails for the caliga.” This was a\r\nstrong, heavy sandal, worn by the Roman soldiers. It was worn by the\r\ncenturions, but not by the superior officers; and from the use of it,\r\nthe common soldiers, including the centurions, were distinguished by\r\nthe name of “caligati.” The Emperor Caligula received that cognomen\r\nwhen a boy, in consequence of wearing the “caliga,” and being inured\r\nto the life of a common soldier. The hob-nails with which the “caliga”\r\nwas studded are mentioned again in B. xxii. c. 46, and B. xxxiv. c.\r\n41. Josephus tells us of the death of a Roman centurion, which was\r\noccasioned by these nails. As he was running over the marble pavement\r\nof the temple of Jerusalem, his foot slipped, and he was unable to\r\nrise, upon which he was overpowered by the Jews, and slain. After the\r\ndecline of the Roman empire, the caliga was no longer worn by the\r\nsoldiers, but was assumed by the monks and recluses.\r\n\r\n[2439] Dalechamps says, that in a similar manner, in the lake known by\r\nthe name of Paladru, fish of most delicate flavour, called “umblæ,”\r\nwere to be taken in the month of December, and at no other part of\r\nthe year; so, too, the alausæ, which are found in the Rhine, near\r\nStrasburg, in the month of May only, and at no other time.\r\n\r\n[2440] Ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔξω κοιτᾶν “from its sleeping out of the water.” This\r\nfish is also mentioned by Theophrastus, in his Fragment on the “Fish\r\nthat live on dry land;” by Clearchus the Peripatetic, as quoted by\r\nAthenæus, B. viii.; Oppian, in his Halieutics, B. i. l. 158; and\r\nÆlian, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 36. The fish, however, mentioned by all\r\nthese authorities, is a sea-fish, while that of Pliny, being found in\r\nArcadia, must, of necessity, be a river fish. The proper name of the\r\nfish here mentioned by him was ποικιλίας, Hardouin says, so called from\r\nthe variety of its colours. Cuvier says, that the fish here mentioned\r\nis not the Exocœtus of Linnæus, which is one of the flying fish, but is\r\nclearly of opinion that it is one of the genus Blennius, or Gobio, that\r\nis alluded to; for these small fish are often to be found left on the\r\nshore when the waters retire, and have the property of being able to\r\nremain alive for a considerable time without water.\r\n\r\n[2441] In the river Aroanius, which falls into the Clitorius. Pausanias\r\nmentions this story, but adds, that he never could hear the fish,\r\nalthough he often went there to listen. Mnaseas of Patræ, an author\r\nquoted by Athenæus, B. viii., also mentions these vocal fishes.\r\n\r\n[2442] Cuvier understands this to mean only, that the openings of the\r\ngills are remarkably small: for, as he says, there is no fish whatever\r\nwithout gills. It is very possible, however, that Pliny may have\r\nmistranslated a passage found in Athenæus, and quoted from Clearchus\r\nthe Peripatetic, in which he says that some fish have a voice, and yet\r\nhave no throat, βρόγχον; which may have, possibly, been mistaken by our\r\nauthor for βράγχια, “gills.”\r\n\r\n[2443] “Marini mures.” Cuvier says, that according to Oppian, Halieut.\r\nB. v. c. 174, _et seq._, the sea-mice, small as they are, attack other\r\nfish, and offer resistance even to man himself. Their skin, he says,\r\nis very solid, and their teeth very strong. Theophrastus names them\r\nalong with seals and birds, as feeding both on land and at sea. Cuvier\r\nis somewhat at a loss whether to pronounce them, with Dalechamps, to\r\nbe a kind of turtle. If so, he considers that this would be the little\r\nturtle, Testudo coriacea of Linnæus, which is by no means uncommon in\r\nthe Mediterranean. He suggests, however, that there are equal grounds\r\nfor taking it to be the Flasco psaro, or Tetrodon lineatus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2444] The Sepia octopodia of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2445] The Muræna helena of Linnæus. This animal, Cuvier says, like the\r\neel, is able to live out of water, in consequence of the minute size of\r\nthe branchial orifices, as Theophrastus very accurately explains. It is\r\na common opinion that they come out of the water in search of others of\r\ntheir kind; but Spallanzani was informed by the fishermen of Comacchio,\r\nthat this hardly ever is the case, and that they will only leave the\r\nwater when compelled. The polypus also crawls very briskly on the shore\r\nwhen it has been thrown up by the tide, and moves with considerable\r\nswiftness.\r\n\r\n[2446] This is also stated by the author of the treatise, De Mirab.\r\nAuscult. c. 72; and Theophrastus, in his work on the “Fishes that can\r\nlive on land,” says, that these Indian fishes resemble the mullet.\r\nCuvier says, that these fish are those known as the various species of\r\nthe genus Ophicephalus of Bloch, which bear a strong resemblance to the\r\nmullet in the head and body. Mr. Hamilton Buchanan, in his “History of\r\nthe Fishes of Bengal,” says, that these fish crawl on the grass to so\r\ngreat a distance from their rivers, that the people absolutely believe\r\nthat they must have fallen from heaven.\r\n\r\n[2447] Or the “Fishes.” As if, indeed, Hardouin says, the resemblance\r\nof name given to the constellation could have any effect upon the fish!\r\n\r\n[2448] The turbot, Pleuronectes maximus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2449] Pleuronectes solea of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2450] “Passer.” Probably our “plaice”—the Pleuronectes platessa of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[2451] The pleuronectes in general, Cuvier says, have the two eyes\r\nsituate on the same side of the body. The turbot has them on the left\r\nside, and lies on the sand on the right side, while the plaice or the\r\nflounder has the eyes on the right, and lies on the left side—the\r\nreverse of what Pliny says.\r\n\r\n[2452] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2453] By this Pliny means, Cuvier says, only the symmetrical fins, or\r\npairs of fins, the pectoral namely, which are in place of arms, and the\r\nventral, which are instead of feet; of which, in fact, no fish has more\r\nthan two pairs. Pliny does not include in this statement the dorsal,\r\nanal, and pectoral fins.\r\n\r\n[2454] Eels and congers, for instance, which have but one pair.\r\n\r\n[2455] Murænæ and lampreys.\r\n\r\n[2456] See B. iii. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2457] Cuvier thinks that there can be no question that he is speaking\r\nhere of some mollusc or crustaceous animal.\r\n\r\n[2458] Murænæ, like eels, have gills, but the orifice, Cuvier says, is\r\nmuch smaller than in the eel, and the opercula, under the skin, are\r\nso small as to be hardly perceptible; indeed, so much so, that modern\r\nnaturalists, Lacepède, for instance, have denied the fact of their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[2459] Aristotle, De Part. Anim. B. iv. c. 13, and Hist. Anim. B. i. c.\r\n6.\r\n\r\n[2460] Or sting-ray. On the contrary, Cuvier says, the pastinaca, more\r\nthan any other ray, has large pectoral fins, horizontally placed; but\r\nthey adhere so closely to the body that they do not appear to be fins,\r\nunless closely examined.\r\n\r\n[2461] By this name, Cuvier says, he calls the tentacles or feelers,\r\nwhich adhere to the head of the polypus, and which it uses equally for\r\nthe purpose of swimming or crawling.\r\n\r\n[2462] Spallanzani, in his “Nat. Hist. of the Eel in the Lagunes of\r\nComacchio,” says, that immediately after their birth they retreat to\r\nthe Lagunes, and at the end of five years re-enter the river Po.\r\n\r\n[2463] Eighty or a hundred hours at most, Spallanzani says.\r\n\r\n[2464] Cold, or a foul state of the water, Cuvier says, is very\r\ndestructive to the eel.\r\n\r\n[2465] Or Pleiades. See c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2466] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 75, says the same, and\r\nlikewise that they feed _mostly_ at night. The reason for their not\r\nfloating when dead, he says, is their peculiar conformation; the belly\r\nbeing so remarkably small that the water cannot find an entrance; added\r\nto which they have no fat upon them.\r\n\r\n[2467] See B. iii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[2468] See B. iii. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2469] The setting of the Pleiades or the rising of Arcturus. See B.\r\nii. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[2470] Spallanzani informs us that the fishermen of the Lagunes of\r\nComacchio form with reeds small chambers, by means of which they take\r\nthe eels when endeavouring to re-enter the river Po; in these such vast\r\nmultitudes are collected, that they are absolutely to be seen above the\r\nsurface of the water.\r\n\r\n[2471] Excipulis.\r\n\r\n[2472] Hardouin says, that though this assertion is repeated by Pliny\r\nin c. 74 of the present Book, it is a mistake; we learn, however, from\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 11, and Athenæus, B. vii., that the\r\nyoung of the muræna are remarkable for the quickness of their growth.\r\n\r\n[2473] This vulgar belief is, however, followed by Oppian, Halieut. B.\r\ni. c. 555; Athenæus, B. vii.; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 50, and B.\r\nix. c. 66; and Nicander, Theriac., who, however, adds, “if indeed it is\r\nthe truth.” It is also alluded to by Basil, in Hexaem. Homil. vii., and\r\nAmbrose, Homil. v. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2474] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 11, only quotes this story as\r\nhe had heard it, and does not vouch for its truth. Doro, as quoted by\r\nAthenæus, B. vii., makes the zmyrus and the muræna to be of totally\r\ndifferent genera. The zmyrus, he says, is without bone, the whole of it\r\nis eatable, and it is remarkable for the tenderness of the flesh. There\r\nare two kinds, of which the best, he says, are those which are black.\r\n\r\n[2475] The common muræna, Cuvier says, is spotted with brown and\r\nyellow, but there is a larger kind, with stronger teeth and brown all\r\nover, the Muræna Christini, of Risso. This, he has no doubt, is the\r\nzmyrus of the ancients. Modern naturalists, he says, have incorrectly\r\ncalled Muræna zmyrus, a small kind of conger, which has yellow spots\r\nupon the neck.\r\n\r\n[2476] Cuvier has already made some remarks on this passage in one of\r\nhis Notes to c. 24 of the present Book. See p. 395.\r\n\r\n[2477] The Seven Terriones, or plough oxen. The constellation of Ursa\r\nMajor was thus called by the Romans.\r\n\r\n[2478] This wretched man was originally a freedman, and though he was\r\non one occasion punished by Augustus for his cruelty, he left him a\r\ngreat part of his property. He died B.C. 15. He is supposed to be the\r\nsame person as the one against whom Augustus wrote some Fescennine\r\nverses, mentioned by Macrobius, Sat. B. ii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2479] Until the Roman youth assumed the toga virilis, they wore the\r\ntoga prætexta, or senatorial gown. The toga virilis was assumed at\r\nthe Liberalia, in the month of March; and though no age appears to\r\nhave been positively fixed for the ceremony, it probably took place,\r\nas a general rule, on the feast which next followed the completion of\r\nthe fourteenth year; though it is not certain that the completion of\r\nthe fourteenth year was not always the time observed. So long as a\r\nmale wore the prætexta, he was considered “impubes,” and when he had\r\nassumed the toga virilis, he was “pubes.” Hence the word “investis,” or\r\n“prætextatus,” (here employed), was the same as impubes.\r\n\r\n[2480] Thus the “impubes” paid, as Hardouin says, “not in money, but in\r\nskin.” Isidorus, in his Glossary, says, “‘Anguilla’ is the name given\r\nto the ordinary ‘scutica,’ or whip with which boys are chastised at\r\nschool.” The witty Rabelais says, B. ii. c. 30, “Whereupon his master\r\ngave him such a sound lashing with an eel-skin, that his own would have\r\nbeen worth nothing to make bag-pipe bags of.”\r\n\r\n[2481] The ray.\r\n\r\n[2482] The sting-ray; the Raia pastinaca of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2483] The angel-fish; the Squalus squatina of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2484] The Raia torpedo of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2485] Galen, in his explanation of words used by Hippocrates, speaks\r\nof the βοῦς θαλάσσιος, which is also described by Oppian, Halieut.\r\nB. ii. l. 141, _et seq._ He speaks of it as growing to the length of\r\neleven or twelve cubits, and having small, weak teeth, which are not\r\neasily seen, and compares it in appearance to the roof of a house.\r\nCuvier thinks, that although its horns are not mentioned, a species\r\nof large horned ray is alluded to, which is known by the modern\r\nnaturalists by the name of Cephalopterus, and he thinks it very likely\r\nthese horns may have given it its Greek appellation. Indeed Pliny\r\nhimself, in another place, B. xxxii. c. 53, speaks of it under the name\r\nof “cornuta,” the “horned-fish.”\r\n\r\n[2486] A species of ray, most probably.\r\n\r\n[2487] Cuvier suggests that this was the mylobates, the Raia aquila of\r\nLinnæus, which probably obtained this name on account of the width of\r\nthe pectoral fins, and its peculiar shape.\r\n\r\n[2488] Βάτραχος ἁλιεὺς, the sea-frog, the Lophius piscatorius of\r\nLinnæus, and the baudroie of the French. Cuvier remarks, that though\r\nthere is little solidity or firmness in the bones of this animal, it is\r\nnot properly a cartilaginous fish.\r\n\r\n[2489] This is borrowed from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v., who,\r\nhowever, says, καὶ πάντα τὰ γαλεώδη; from which Massarius, Turnebus,\r\nand Hippolytus Salvianus are inclined to read “galei,” instead of\r\n“squali.” Both terms, however, Hardouin says, are used to denote the\r\ngenus which the French call “chiens de mer,” “dog-fish.”\r\n\r\n[2490] It is curious that Aristotle, though he was the inventor of this\r\nname, has nowhere stated in what it originated. Galen, De Alim. Fac.\r\nB. iii. c. 36, says that it is ἀπὸ τοῦ σέλας ἔχειν, from the fact of\r\ntheir shining at night.\r\n\r\n[2491] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5, and De Part. Anim. B. iv.\r\nc. 13.\r\n\r\n[2492] In c. 7 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2493] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2494] Cuvier says that it is true that the sea-frog is oviparous; but\r\nit is far from being the case that all the cartilaginous fishes but it\r\nare viviparous. The rays, for instance, produce large eggs of a square\r\nshape, and enveloped with a very hard horny shell. Aristotle, Hist.\r\nAnim. B. viii. c. 5, and B. ii. c. 16, makes the same exception as to\r\nthe sea-frog or frog-fish.\r\n\r\n[2495] This is also from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 17. Oppian\r\nalso mentions it, Halieut. B. i. l. 223, _et seq._, but he gives it all\r\nthe characteristics of the modern lamprey.\r\n\r\n[2496] This is the Echeneis remora of Linnæus, Cuvier says. It has\r\nupon the head an organ, by means of which it can attach itself to any\r\nbody. It is thus enabled to fasten to ships and larger fishes; but as\r\nfor staying a ship, it has not, as Cuvier remarks, the slightest power\r\nover the very smallest boat. All the eloquence, therefore, which Pliny\r\nexpends upon it, in B. xxxii. c. 1, is entirely thrown away.\r\n\r\n[2497] Ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔχειν νῆας. “From holding back ships.”\r\n\r\n[2498] Used for the purpose of bringing back lost love, or preventing\r\ninconstancy.\r\n\r\n[2499] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2500] Hardouin says that it is very possible that Aristotle may have\r\nwritten to this effect in some one of the fifty books of his that have\r\nperished, but that such is not the case in his account given of this\r\nfish in his Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 17, for there he expressly says,\r\n“There are some people that say this fish has feet, whereas it has none\r\nat all; but they are deceived by the fins, which bear a resemblance to\r\nfeet.” Cuvier says he cannot see in what way the fins of the remora, or\r\nsucking-fish, resemble feet, any more than those belonging to any other\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n[2501] Cuvier says, that the shell-fish to which Pliny here ascribes\r\na power similar to that of the remora, is, if we may judge from his\r\ndescription of it, of the genus called Cypræa, and has very little\r\ndoubt that its peculiar form caused its consecration to Venus, fully as\r\nmuch as its supposed miraculous powers. He also remarks that Hardouin,\r\nin his Note upon this passage, supposes an impossibility, in suggesting\r\nthat the lips of this shell-fish can bite the sides of a ship; these\r\nlips or edges being hard and immoveable. For some curious particulars\r\nas to the peculiar form of some kinds of Cypræa, or cowry, and why they\r\nmore especially attracted attention, and were held sacred to Venus, see\r\nthe discussion on them, in the Defence made by Apuleius against the\r\ncharge of sorcery, which was brought against him.\r\n\r\n[2502] Rondelet, B. xiii. c. 12, says that this kind of shell was\r\nformerly used for the purpose of smoothing paper.\r\n\r\n[2503] Herodotus tells us, B. iii. c. 48, that these were 300 boys of\r\nnoble families of the Corcyræans, and that they were being sent from\r\nPeriander of Corinth, to Alyattes, king of Sardes.\r\n\r\n[2504] Venus was fabled to have emerged from the sea in a shell.\r\n\r\n[2505] Rabelais refers to these wonderful stories about the echeneis\r\nor remora, B. iv. c. 62: “And indeed, why should he have thought this\r\ndifficult, seeing that —— an echeneis or remora, a silly, weakly fish,\r\nin spite of all the winds that blow from the thirty-two points of\r\nthe compass, will in the midst of a hurricane make you, the biggest\r\nfirst-rate, remain stock still, as if she were becalmed, or the\r\nblustering tribe had blown their last; nay, and with the flesh of that\r\nfish, preserved with salt, you may fish gold out of the deepest well\r\nthat ever was sounded with a plummet; for it will certainly draw up the\r\nprecious metal.”\r\n\r\n[2506] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 34; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B.\r\nxii. c. 48. Rondelet is of opinion that this mæna was the fish still\r\ncalled menola by the people of Liguria and Rome. It was a fish little\r\nvalued, and we find it called by Martial, “inutilis mæna,” B. xii.\r\nEpigr. 30. Cuvier says, that if it does not change from white to black,\r\nas Pliny states, its colours are much more lively in the spring.\r\nIt also has an offensive smell at certain times, as is noticed by\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 30, and to which Martial alludes in\r\nthe above epigram. Ovid also mentions it as a fish of no value; held,\r\nin all probability, in the same degree of estimation as a sprat with\r\nus. It is, no doubt, the Sparus mæna of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2507] We learn from Aristotle, B. viii. c. 30, that the phycis was a\r\nwhitish fish, which in the spring assumed a variegated colour. In an\r\nEpigram of Apollonides it is called “red;” and Speusippus, as quoted in\r\nAthenæus, B. v., says that it is similar to the perch and the channe.\r\nOvid speaks of it as frequenting the shore, and Oppian represents it as\r\ndwelling among the sea-weed on the rocks. It also lived on shrimps, and\r\nits flesh was light and wholesome; while its most singular property was\r\nthat of making its nest among the fucus or sea-weed, whence its name.\r\nAll these characteristics, Cuvier says, are to be found, from what\r\nOlivi states, in the “_go_” of the Venetians, found in the Adriatic,\r\nthe Gobius of Linnæus; the male of which in the spring makes a nest of\r\nthe roots of the zostera in the mud, in which the female lays her eggs,\r\nwhich are fecundated by itself, and then protected by it against the\r\nattacks of enemies. This is probably the fish that is alluded to by\r\nOvid, Halieut. l. 121, “The fish that imitates, beneath the waves, the\r\npretty nests of the birds.”\r\n\r\n[2508] This name, Cuvier observes, is still common on the coasts of\r\nthe Mediterranean, to two kinds of flying fish, the Dactylopterus, or\r\nTrigla volitans of Linnæus, and the Exocœtus volitans of Linnæus. It\r\nis to the first, he thinks, that the ancients more especially gave\r\nthe name of swallow, although Salvianus and Belon are of the contrary\r\nopinion. Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. ll. 457-461, ranks the sea-swallow\r\nwith the scorpion, the dragon, and other fish the spines of which\r\nproduce mortal wounds, and Ælian, B. ii. c. 5, states to the same\r\neffect. But the exocœtus has no spines, while the dactylopterus has\r\nterrible ones on its præopercules. Speusippus also, as quoted in\r\nAthenæus, B. vii., gives no less decisive testimony, in saying that the\r\nsea-cuckoo, the trigla, and the sea-swallow, have a strong resemblance\r\nto each other; the fact being that the dactylopterus is of the same\r\ngenus as the sea-cuckoo, the Trigla cuculus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2509] Ovid, Halieut. l. 96, speaks of this fish as having a black\r\nback. Cuvier therefore suggests that it may possibly be the perlon, the\r\nTrigla hirundo of Linuæus, the back of which is of a dark brown, and\r\nthe great size of the pectoral fins of which may have given rise to the\r\nnotion of its being able to fly. It is also very possible, he says,\r\nthat it may have been the exocœtus, the back of which is of a blue\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n[2510] Lucerna. Probably, as Cuvier says, one of those numerous\r\nmolluscs, or zoophytes, which give out a brilliant light, and perhaps\r\nthe Pyrosoma of Péron. No period being found in the MSS. after the\r\nword “milvus”—“kite,” it was long thought that this passage applied to\r\nthe sea-kite; and it is owing to this circumstance that we find the\r\nichthyologists enumerating a Trigla lucerna. The correction, however,\r\nis approved of by Cuvier, who says that he has found none of the genus\r\ntriglæ to give forth a light; except, indeed, when, like other fish, it\r\nbegins to be putrid.\r\n\r\n[2511] Probably the “cornuta,” mentioned in the Note on the sea-ox in\r\nc. 40; see p. 411. Cuvier says that it was long supposed that the fish\r\nhere alluded to might be the Malarmat of the Mediterranean, the Trigla\r\ncataphracta of Linnæus, the muzzle of which is divided into two horns;\r\nbut then they are only half an inch long, instead of a foot and a half.\r\nHe is of opinion, therefore, that it is the great horned ray, now known\r\nas the cephalopterus, which, being often fifteen feet and more in\r\ndiameter, answers much better to the description of its size implied\r\nby Pliny from the length of its horns. It is also mentioned under the\r\nname of cornuta in B. xxxii. c. 53, in company with the saw-fish, the\r\nsword-fish, the dog-fish, and other large fishes.\r\n\r\n[2512] Cuvier is of opinion, that Rondelet is correct in his suggestion\r\nthat this is the sea-spider, called the “vive” in France, the viver\r\nor weever with us, and the Trachinus draco of Linnæus, which fish is\r\nstill called δράκαινα by the modern Greeks. Pliny, in c. 48 of the\r\npresent Book, charges the sea-spider with doing much mischief, by means\r\nof the spines or stickles on its back. Now Ælian, B. ii. c. 50, and\r\nOppian, Halieut. l. 458, say the same of the sea-dragon; and this is a\r\nwell-known property of the modern vive, the Trachinus draco of Linnæus.\r\nPliny speaks more especially, in B. xxxii. c. 53, of the wounds which\r\nit makes with the spines or stickles of its opercules, which the vive\r\nis also able to inflict; and in addition to this, it has the power of\r\nburrowing into the sand in a most incredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\n[2513] Cuvier remarks, that this division of the bloodless fish by\r\nAristotle into the mollusca, testacea, and crustacea, has been followed\r\nby naturalists almost down to the present day.\r\n\r\n[2514] The Sæpia loligo of Linnæus; the calmar of the French, or\r\nink-fish.\r\n\r\n[2515] The Sæpia officinalis of Linnæus; the seche of the French; our\r\ncuttle-fish.\r\n\r\n[2516] The Sæpia octopodia of Linnæus, or eight-footed cuttle-fish.\r\n\r\n[2517] Cuvier remarks, that this account of the arms or feelers of the\r\nsæpia and loligo is very exact.\r\n\r\n[2518] “Quibus venantur.” Hardouin suggests that the proper reading\r\nwould be “quibus natant”—“by means of which they swim;” for Aristotle\r\nsays, in the corresponding passage, “with the fins that surround the\r\nbody they swim.”\r\n\r\n[2519] Plautus has a line in his Rudens, which shows that when the\r\nsæpia was cooked for table, it was customary to take the eyes out. “Bid\r\nthem knock out his eyes, just as the cooks do with the sæpia.”\r\n\r\n[2520] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 2, states to a similar effect,\r\nas also Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 34; Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. l. 156.\r\n\r\n[2521] This so-called ink, Cuvier says, is neither their blood nor\r\ntheir bile, but a liquid that is secreted in a bag peculiar to the\r\nanimal. It is said, that it is from the juices of certain polypi of\r\nthe Eastern seas, that the genuine Indian or Chinese ink is made; but\r\nM. Abel Remusat assures us that he has found nothing in the Chinese\r\nwriters to confirm this conjecture.\r\n\r\n[2522] This, as Hardouin says, is the polypus which is found on the\r\nsea-shore, and which more frequently comes on dry land than the other\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n[2523] The arms of the polypus have numerous names with the Latin\r\nauthors. Ovid calls them “flagella,”—“whips;” others again,\r\n“cirri”—“curls;” “pedes”—“feet;” “crura”—“legs;” and “crines”—“hair.”\r\n\r\n[2524] This, Cuvier says, is quite unintelligible; for all the polypi\r\nhave an oval body, of the shape of a bag, and there is nothing in them\r\nthat bears any resemblance to a tail, forked or otherwise.\r\n\r\n[2525] This channel, Cuvier says, is in form of a funnel reversed,\r\nby means of which the animal draws in and ejects the water that is\r\nrequisite for its respiration, and discharges the ink and other\r\nexcretions. It is in the fore-part of the body, and at the orifice of\r\nthe bag, and not on the back, as Pliny says; but, as Cuvier remarks,\r\nit was very easy for a person to be deceived in this matter, as the\r\nhead, being in form of a cylinder, and fringed with the so-called feet,\r\ncannot be said to be distinguished into an upper and lower side.\r\n\r\n[2526] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 2, says that the animal is\r\nobliged to do so, on account of the situation of the eyes.\r\n\r\n[2527] But Aristotle says, καθάπερ ἐμπεφυσημένην, “_as though_ it were\r\npuffed out with air.”\r\n\r\n[2528] “Acetabulis.” The acetabulum was properly a vinegar cruet, in\r\nshape resembling an inverted cone; from a supposed similarity in the\r\nappearance, it is here applied to the suckers of the polypus. The Greek\r\nname is κοτυληδὼν.\r\n\r\n[2529] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[2530] Cuvier says, that the changes of colour of the skin of the\r\npolypus are continual, and succeed each other with an extreme rapidity;\r\nbut that it has not been observed, any more than the chameleon, to take\r\nthe colour of objects in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[2531] This notion is mentioned by Athenæus, Pherecrates, Alcæus,\r\nHesiod, Oppian, and Ælian.\r\n\r\n[2532] Cuvier says, that Pliny states, in B. xxix. c. 28, that the\r\ncolotis, or colotes of the Greeks, is the same as their ascalabotes,\r\nthe “stellio” of the Latins. This stellio is the same as the “gecko”\r\nof the moderns, and the species known in Italy and Greece is the same\r\nas the “wall gecko” of the French, or the tarente of the Provencals.\r\nFrom what Pliny says here about its tail, it would appear to have been\r\na lizard; but its identity with the stellio, Cuvier says, is very\r\ndoubtful. It will be mentioned more at length in B. xi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[2533] It is very true, Cuvier says, that the tail of the gecko and\r\nlizard will grow again after it has been cut off, but without vertebræ.\r\nAs to the arms of the polypus, he says, it is very possible, seeing\r\nthat the horns of the snail, which belongs to the same family, will\r\ngrow again.\r\n\r\n[2534] This account of the nautilus, Cuvier says, the Argonauta argo of\r\nLinnæus, wonderful as it may appear, has been often confirmed by modern\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[2535] This, Cuvier says, is not a membrane between the two feet or\r\ntentacles, but a distinct membranous delatation of the extremity of\r\neach of those two organs.\r\n\r\n[2536] These vessels have been already remarked upon in Note 33 to c. 5\r\nof the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2537] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 61.\r\n\r\n[2538] From ὄζω, “to emit an odour.” This was a small kind of polypus.\r\n\r\n[2539] Cuvier remarks that, in this Chapter, there are many details\r\nrelative to the polypus, that have not been observed by modern\r\nnaturalists; but they may have been observed by the Greeks, upon whose\r\nshores and islands the animal was much more frequently to be found than\r\nin the west of Europe.\r\n\r\n[2540] Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. l. 260, describes the battles of these\r\nanimals with the polypus. He also says, B. iii. c. 198, that they are\r\nattracted by the smell of the flesh of the polypus, and so are easily\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[2541] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[2542] Oppian, Halieut. B. i. l. 551, says, that they hardly live a\r\nyear; and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 28, states to a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[2543] Basil attributes a similar craftiness to the crab; Hexaem.\r\nHomil. vii.\r\n\r\n[2544] The fishermen at the present day, upon the coast of Normandy,\r\nsay that the polypus, which they call the _chatrou_, is a most\r\nformidable enemy to swimmers and divers; for when it has embraced any\r\nof the limbs with its tentacles, it adheres with such tenacity, that it\r\nis quite impossible for a person to disengage himself, or to move any\r\nof his limbs.\r\n\r\n[2545] In Spain; see B. iii. c. 3. Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 13,\r\ntells a similar story about a polypus at Puteoli.\r\n\r\n[2546] “Lacus;” large tubs used in the process of pickling. This story,\r\nCuvier observes, is only surpassed by those told by the Norwegians\r\nrelative to the “kraken” of their seas, which, according to some\r\nversions of the fable, is a polypus of such vast size, that sailors\r\nhave sometimes mistaken it for an island.\r\n\r\n[2547] “Nassis.” The “nassa” was a contrivance for catching fish by the\r\njunction of osier or willow rods. It was probably made in the shape of\r\na large bottle with a narrow mouth, and placed with the mouth facing\r\nthe current. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 8, states, that the\r\nfishermen, when they were desirous of bringing the fish out of their\r\nholes, were in the habit of rubbing the mouth of the holes with salted\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n[2548] Oppian, Halieut. B. i. c. 310, tells a story of a polypus,\r\nof the ozæna species, that was in the habit of climbing trees, and\r\nplundering the fruit.\r\n\r\n[2549] “Afflatu terribili.” This, as Hardouin says, may either mean its\r\nbad smell, or stinking water, ejected from its canal.\r\n\r\n[2550] Its arms or feelers. The amphora, as a measure of capacity, held\r\nabout nine English gallons.\r\n\r\n[2551] “Caliculis;” literally, “little glasses.” Its “acetabula,” or\r\nsuckers, are so called from their peculiar shape.\r\n\r\n[2552] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 2, says the same; but, as\r\nHardouin observes, he must mean the Ionian sea.\r\n\r\n[2553] Cuvier says, that this is only a reproduction, under another\r\nname, and with other details, of the story of the nautilus or\r\nargonauta; but under the impression that the polyp is not the animal\r\nwhich owns the shell, but is only its associate. It has also been\r\nasserted in modern times, he says, that the polyp has seized this shell\r\nby force from some other animal, in order to convert it into its boat;\r\nbut the opinion has not been adopted, as the shell of the nautilus has\r\nbeen never found in the possession of any other animal.\r\n\r\n[2554] Probably borrowed from the Greeks, who called it ἄκατος. It is\r\nsupposed to have been a small boat, similar to the Roman “scapha;” like\r\nour “skiff” probably.\r\n\r\n[2555] The “rostrum” of the ancient ships of war.\r\n\r\n[2556] “Palmulis.” This word also means the blade or broad part of an\r\noar; in which sense it may, perhaps, be here taken.\r\n\r\n[2557] “Locusta;” literally, the “locust” of the sea. By this name is\r\nmeant, Cuvier says, the “langouste” of the French (our cray-fish),\r\nwhich has no large forcipes, and has a thorax covered with spines; the\r\nPalinurus quadricornis of the naturalists. This is clearly the κάραβος\r\nof Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 23; for we generally find it thus\r\ntranslated by Pliny, when he borrows anything from that philosopher.\r\nWe know that the body of this animal was spiny, from the fact that\r\nTiberius, as we learn from Suetonius, cruelly caused the face of a\r\nfisherman who had offended him, to be rubbed with a locusta.\r\n\r\n[2558] Aristotle, and Theophrastus, in his “Treatise on Animals which\r\nconceal themselves,” state to a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[2559] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 4, states to a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[2560] Aristotle, _loc. cit._, and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 25,\r\nstate to the same effect.\r\n\r\n[2561] Hardouin says, that this must be only understood of the kind of\r\ncrab known as the “astacus;” that being the one mentioned by Aristotle,\r\nin the passage from which Pliny has borrowed.\r\n\r\n[2562] He mentions, in B. ii. c. 41, the effect which the rays of the\r\nmoon have upon the growth of shell-fish.\r\n\r\n[2563] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 2, has a somewhat similar\r\npassage. “The kinds of crabs are numerous, and not easily to be\r\nenumerated. First, there are those known as maiæ, then the paguri,\r\nwhich are also called ‘heracleotici;’ and, after them, the river crabs.\r\nThere are others, again, of a smaller size, and which, for the most\r\npart, are known by no name in particular.”\r\n\r\n[2564] This is, no doubt, the cray-fish, the same animal that has been\r\ncalled the “locusta” in the preceding Chapter. Aristotle states, B.\r\niv. c. 8, that the carabus has the thorax rough and spiny. It is most\r\nprobable, that it is from this name that our word “crab” is derived.\r\n\r\n[2565] Cuvier says, that the astacus, which is very accurately\r\ndescribed by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 8, is indisputably\r\nthe homard of the French (the common lobster of the English); the\r\nCancer gammarius of Linnæus. Pliny, in another place, B. xxx. c. ii.,\r\ndescribes it himself under the name of elephantus.\r\n\r\n[2566] Cuvier remarks, that according to Aristotle, B. iv. c. 2, the\r\nmaiæ are in the number of the καρκίνοι, or crabs that have a short\r\ntail concealed beneath the body, being those of the largest kind. The\r\nsame philosopher, De Part. Anim. B. iv. c. 8, adds, that these have\r\nalso short feet and a hard shell. Cuvier says, that many writers have\r\napplied this name to the crabs at the present day belonging to the\r\ngenus inachus, and more especially the Cancer maia of Linnæus. He is\r\nmore inclined, however, to think that the maia was the common French\r\ncrab, known as poupart or tourtue, the Cancer pagurus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2567] Hardouin says, that these are the same that the Venetians\r\nwere in the habit of calling “cancro poro,” the last word being a\r\ncorruption, as he thinks, of pagurus. Aristotle says, _loc. cit._, that\r\nthey were crabs of middling size.\r\n\r\n[2568] Or Heracleotic crabs. Aristotle says, De Partib. Anim. B. iv.\r\nc. 8, that these crabs had shorter feet and thinner than those of the\r\nmaiæ. Cuvier suggests, that these may be the commonest kind of crab,\r\nthe Cancer mænas of Linnæus, or a species very similar.\r\n\r\n[2569] “Leones.” This name is not found in Aristotle’s account, but it\r\nis found in Athenæus, B. iii. c. 106; and in Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xiv.\r\nc. 9. According to Diphilus, as quoted by Athenæus, it was of larger\r\nsize than the astacus. Ælian describes it as more slender in shape\r\nthan the cray-fish, and partly of a bluish colour, and with very large\r\nforcipes, in which it resembles, Cuvier says, the homard of the French.\r\nIt is possible, however, he adds, that it may have been only a second\r\nname given to the astacus already mentioned; as both Pliny and Ælian,\r\nwho were not critical observers, are very liable to make errors in\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n[2570] Aristotle, Cuvier observes, states the carcini, or crabs, have\r\nno tail, the fact being that the tail is extremely small, and is\r\nconcealed, as it were, in a furrow in the under part of the body. The\r\ncray-fish, on the other hand, has a large and broad tail.\r\n\r\n[2571] Ἱπποὶ. The more common reading is ἱππεῖς, “horsemen.” Cuvier\r\nthinks, that in all probability, these are a kind of crab with very\r\nlong legs, vulgarly known as the sea-spider; the Macropodia and the\r\nLeptopodia of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2572] Hardouin remarks, that Aristotle says this only of the carabi,\r\nor cray-fish, and not of the crabs in general; and that, on the\r\ncontrary, in B. v. c. 7, he says, that in the crab the male does not\r\ndiffer in conformation from the female, except in the opercule. There\r\nseems, in reality, to be no foundation for the statement here made by\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\n[2573] Both in the crab and the cray-fish, Aristotle says.\r\n\r\n[2574] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 24, calls this kind of crab\r\nδρομίας, the “runner,” from the great distance it is known to travel.\r\nHe says, that they meet together, coming in one by one, at a certain\r\nbay in the Thracian Bosporus, where those who have arrived wait for\r\nthe others; and that on finding that the waves of the Euxine are\r\nsufficiently violent to sweep them away, they unite in a dense body,\r\nand then waiting till the waters have retired, make a passage across\r\nthe straits.\r\n\r\n[2575] Cuvier remarks, that Hardouin is correct in considering this\r\nthe same as the crab known in France as Bernard the Hermit (our\r\nhermit-crab), the Cancer Bernardus of Linnæus, a species of the\r\ngenus now known as the Pagur. This animal hides its tail and lower\r\nextremities in the empty shells of whelks, or other univalves. Cuvier\r\nsuggests that our author committed a slip of the pen, in using the\r\nword oyster here for shell-fish. This is the καρκίνιον, probably, of\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 15, and De Part. Anim. B. iv. c. 8;\r\nand it is most probable that, as Cuvier states, the real πιννοτήρης of\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 4, and B. v. c. 14, was another of the\r\ncrustacea, of which Pliny speaks under the same name in c. 66. This\r\nlast is a small crab, that lives in the shells of bivalves, such as\r\nmussels, &c., but not when empty. See the Notes to c. 66.\r\n\r\n[2576] This circumstance is more fully treated of in B. xxxii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2577] Our author speaks rather more guardedly here than usual; and\r\nHardouin seems almost inclined to believe the story. Ovid also alludes\r\nto this story in the Met. B. xv. l. 370, _et seq._ “If you take off the\r\nbending claws from the crab of the sea-shore, and bury the rest in the\r\nearth, a scorpion will come forth from the part so buried, and will\r\nthreaten with its crooked tail.”\r\n\r\n[2578] Of animals covered with a thin crust.\r\n\r\n[2579] The sea-urchin, the herisson de mer of the French, and the\r\nEchinus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2580] Cuvier remarks, that it does not use the spines or prickles\r\nfor this purpose, but that it moves by means of tentacules, which it\r\nprojects from between its prickles.\r\n\r\n[2581] The Echinus cidaris of Linnæus; with a small body, and very long\r\nspines. The name, according to Hardouin, is from the Greek, meaning the\r\n“mother of the echini.”\r\n\r\n[2582] See B. iv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2583] The same, Cuvier says, with the Echinus spatagus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2584] Not “ova,” Cuvier says, but “ovaria” rather. Each urchin has\r\nfive “ovaria,” arranged in the form of stars. They are supposed to be\r\nhermaphroditical, but there is considerable doubt on the subject.\r\n\r\n[2585] The mouth of the sea-urchin, armed with five teeth, is generally\r\nturned to the ground, Cuvier says.\r\n\r\n[2586] Plutarch, in his Book “on the Instincts of Animals,” Oppian,\r\nHalieut. B. ii. l. 225, and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 44, all\r\nmention this.\r\n\r\n[2587] This idea probably arose from the fact of their being sometimes\r\nfound with stones sticking between their spines or prickles.\r\n\r\n[2588] The thin-crusted animals.\r\n\r\n[2589] Known to us as periwinkles.\r\n\r\n[2590] It is now known, thanks to the research of Swammerdam, that the\r\nblack points at the extremity of the great horns of the land snail, or\r\nHelix terrestris, and at the base of them in the water snail, are eyes.\r\n\r\n[2591] “Pectines in mari;” literally, “sea-combs.” The French still\r\ncall them by a similar name, “peignes.” They are known also in France\r\nas “coquilles de St. Jaques,” or St. James’s shells; probably,\r\nbecause worn by pilgrims who had visited the shrine of St. Jago, at\r\nCompostella. Indeed, the scallop shell was a favourite emblem with\r\nthe palmers and pilgrims of the middle ages, who were in the habit of\r\nwearing it on their return in the hat.\r\n\r\n[2592] He Latinizes the Greek name, calling it “unguis”—“a nail;” and,\r\naccording to Varro, they were so called from their resemblance to the\r\nhuman nail. Pliny mentions them again in c. 87 of this Book, and in B.\r\nxxxii. c. 53, where he states that they are also called “dactyli,” or\r\n“fingers.” Cuvier says, that under this name are meant the pholades, a\r\nbivalve shell-fish, which give forth a very brilliant light.\r\n\r\n[2593] Univalves, with a thick spinous shell.\r\n\r\n[2594] The flat shell-fish, for instance, according to Cuvier, of the\r\ngenus patella, or lepas.\r\n\r\n[2595] Other fish of the genus patella, only more concave; the\r\nhaliotes, for instance.\r\n\r\n[2596] Forming a prolonged cone, Cuvier says, like the cerites.\r\n\r\n[2597] The mouth of which is shaped like a crescent; such as the\r\nhelices, Cuvier says.\r\n\r\n[2598] The nerites, Cuvier says, which are cut into two hemispheres.\r\n\r\n[2599] Such as many of the whelks, Cuvier says.\r\n\r\n[2600] The whelks that have the edge turned inwards, so that one lip\r\nappears to fold under the other.\r\n\r\n[2601] As no two naturalists might probably agree as to the exact\r\nmeaning of the terms here employed, it has been thought advisable to\r\ngive the passage as it appears in the original: “Jam distinctione\r\nvirgulata, crinita, crispa, cuniculatim, pectinatim divisa, imbricatim\r\nundata, cancellatim reticulata, in obliquum, in rectum expansa,\r\ndensata, porrecta, sinuata, brevi nodo legatis, toto latere connexis,\r\nad plausum apertis, ad buccinum recurvis.”\r\n\r\n[2602] In allusion, probably, to the streaks or lines drawn upon the\r\nexterior of the shell.\r\n\r\n[2603] With the mouth wide open, like that of a person in the act of\r\napplauding.\r\n\r\n[2604] By “ad buccinum recurvis,” he probably alludes to a whelk, or\r\nfish with a turbinated shell, resembling the larger conch or trumpet\r\nshell, which Triton is sometimes described as blowing.\r\n\r\n[2605] Probably some of the Cypræa; which have been already alluded to\r\nin Note 6 to c. 41 of the present Book. Cuvier remarks, that there are\r\nmany of the univalve shell-fish that float on the surface of the water,\r\nbut none, with the exception of the argonauta or nautilus, are known to\r\nemploy a membranous sail.\r\n\r\n[2606] Cuvier says, that he has been informed that the scallop, by\r\nsuddenly bringing together the valves of its shell, is able to make a\r\nbound, and leap above the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n[2607] Ajasson says, that the words “purpuras, conchylia,” here signify\r\nnot the fish themselves, but the various tints produced by them; the\r\npurpura and the conchylium being, in fact, exactly the same fish,\r\nthough, as will be explained in c. 60 of the present Book, by various\r\nmodes of treatment, various colours were extracted from them. See also\r\nB. xxi. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[2608] Dalechamps notices here an ancient proverb, which says, “Qui\r\nnare vult, se exuit.” “He who wishes to swim, takes off his clothes.”\r\n\r\n[2609] In c. 2 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2610] In B. vi. cc. 24 and 28.\r\n\r\n[2611] See B. vi. c. 23. Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8, says to the\r\nsame effect, but calls it “Perimuda, a city of India.”\r\n\r\n[2612] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. x. c. 13. It has been already remarked,\r\nin the sixth Book, that the ancients looked upon the Persian Gulf as\r\nforming part of the Erythræan or Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[2613] The pearl itself, Cuvier says, is nothing else but an\r\nextravasation, so to say, of the juices, whose duty it is to line the\r\ninterior of the shell, to thicken and so amplify it; and consequently,\r\nit is produced by a malady. It is possible, he says, for them to be\r\nfound in all shell-fish; but they have no beauty in them, unless the\r\ninterior of the shell, the _nacre_, or, as we call it, the mother of\r\npearl, is lustrous and beautiful itself. Hence it is, that the finest\r\nof them come from the east, and are furnished by the kind of bivalve,\r\ncalled by Linnæus, “Mytilus margaritiferus,” which has the most\r\nbeautiful mother of pearl in the interior that is known. The parts of\r\nthe Indian sea which are mentioned by Pliny, are those in which the\r\npearl oyster is still found in the greatest abundance.\r\n\r\n[2614] All this theory, as Cuvier says, is totally imaginary.\r\n\r\n[2615] Isidorus of Charax, in his description of Parthia, commended by\r\nAthenæus, B. iii., says, on the other hand, that the fish are aided in\r\nbringing forth, by rain and thunder.\r\n\r\n[2616] From the Greek φυσήμα, “air-bubble.”\r\n\r\n[2617] It sometimes happens, Cuvier says, that the secretion which\r\nforms the mother-of-pearl makes tubercles in the interior of the shell,\r\nwhich are the pearls adhering to the shell here spoken of.\r\n\r\n[2618] Persius alludes to this in Sat. ii. l. 66. “Hæc baccam conchæ\r\nrasisse;” “to file the pearl away from its shell.”\r\n\r\n[2619] From this passage we learn that the “tympana,” or hand-drums of\r\nthe ancients, were often of a semiglobular shape, like the kettle-drums\r\nof the present day.\r\n\r\n[2620] Cuvier remarks that this is not the fact: the concretions are\r\nperfectly hard before the animal leaves the water.\r\n\r\n[2621] Isidorus of Charax, as quoted by Athenæus, B. iii.; and Ælian,\r\nHist. Anim. B. x. c. 20, make similar statements. Rondelet, in his\r\ntreatise on Testaceous Fishes, B. i., complains of Pliny using the word\r\n“videt,” “sees,” in the present passage; but, as Hardouin says, he only\r\nuses it in a free sense, meaning, “is aware of the approach of,” or\r\n“has a perception of.”\r\n\r\n[2622] Isidorus of Charax, in Athenæus, B. iii., tells a similar\r\nstory; but modifies it by saying that the fish sometimes cuts off the\r\n_fingers_ of the divers, and not the hands.\r\n\r\n[2623] “Canes marini.” He calls by this name the same animal that a\r\nlittle further on he describes by the name of “canicula,” “dog-fish;”\r\nalluding, probably, under that name to various species of the shark.\r\nProcopius, in his book, De Bell. Pers. B. i. c. 4, has a wonderful\r\nstory in relation to this subject. He says, that the sea-dogs are\r\nwonderful admirers of the pearl-fish, and follow them out to sea; that\r\nwhen the sea-dogs are pressed by hunger, they go in quest of prey, and\r\nthen return to the shell-fish and gaze upon it. A certain fisherman,\r\nhaving watched for the moment when the shell-fish was deprived of the\r\nprotection of its attendant sea-dog, which was seeking its prey, seized\r\nthe shell-fish, and made for the shore. The sea-dog, however, was soon\r\naware of the theft, and making straight for the fisherman, seized him.\r\nFinding himself thus caught, he made a last effort, and threw the\r\npearl-fish on shore, immediately on which he was torn to pieces by its\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\n[2624] Such, for instance, as Megasthenes, quoted by Arrian in his\r\nIndica, and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2625] Hardouin suggests that a preferable reading to “vetuslate,”\r\nwould be “venustate,” by its beauty; and indeed, Ælian, in the\r\ncorresponding passage, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8, says, that the chief is\r\nremarkable “for its size, and the extreme beauty of its colours.”\r\n\r\n[2626] “Nucleos.” The Greek authors occasionally call them “stones”\r\nand “bones.” Tertullian calls them “maladies of shell-fish and\r\nwarts”—“concharum vitia et verrucas.”\r\n\r\n[2627] Cuvier says, that the most efficient mode of extracting all the\r\nconcretions that may happen to be concealed in the body of the animal,\r\nis to leave the flesh to dissolve in water, upon which the concretions\r\nnaturally fall to the bottom.\r\n\r\n[2628] Isidorus and Solinus, however, say that the pearl is so called,\r\nbecause two are never found together. The derivation given by Pliny is,\r\nhowever, the more probable one. From the Latin “unio,” comes our word\r\n“onion;” which, like the pearl, consists of numerous coats, one laid\r\nupon the other.\r\n\r\n[2629] Hence we must conclude that the word “margarita” is not of\r\nGreek, but Eastern origin.\r\n\r\n[2630] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8, says, that the Indian pearls,\r\nand those which come from the Red Sea, are the best.\r\n\r\n[2631] The laminæ of the lapis specularis, described by Pliny, B.\r\nxxxvi. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[2632] “Exaluminatos.” It is clear from this passage that Pliny was\r\nacquainted with our alum, as he here clearly implies that the alum\r\nknown to him was of a white colour. Beckmann, however, in his History\r\nof Inventions, asserts that our alum was _certainly_ not known to\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, and that their “alumen” was nothing else but\r\nvitriol, the green sulphate of iron, and that not in its pure state,\r\nbut such as forms in mines. Pereira, however, in his Materia Medica,\r\nsays, that there can be little doubt that Pliny was acquainted with our\r\nalum, but did not distinguish it from sulphate of iron, as he informs\r\nus that one kind of alum was white, and was used for dyeing wool of\r\nvarious colours. It is mentioned more fully in B. xxxv. c. 52, where he\r\nspeaks of its use in dyeing.\r\n\r\n[2633] These alabaster boxes for unguents are mentioned by Pliny in B.\r\nxxxvi. c. 12. They were usually pear-shaped; and as they were held with\r\ndifficulty in the hand, on account of their extreme smoothness, they\r\nwere called ἀλάβαστρα, from ἀ, “not,” and λαβέσθαι “to be held.” The\r\nreader will recollect the offer made to our Saviour, of the “alabaster\r\nbox of ointment of spikenard, very precious.” Matt. xxvi. 7. Mark xiv.\r\n3.\r\n\r\n[2634] Seneca, Benef. B. vii. c. 9, speaks of them as hanging in tiers\r\nfrom the ears of the Roman matrons, two and two; and he says that they\r\nare not satisfied unless they have two or three patrimonies suspended\r\nfrom each ear.\r\n\r\n[2635] From their resemblance to “crotala,” used by dancers, and\r\nsimilar to our castanets.\r\n\r\n[2636] That the pearls as fully bespeak the importance of the wearer,\r\nas the lictor does of the magistrate whom he is preceding. The honour\r\nof being escorted by one or two lictors, was usually granted to the\r\nwives and other members of the imperial family.\r\n\r\n[2637] Even on the “socculus,” or “soccus,” a shoe or slipper which did\r\nnot require any “obstragulum,” or tie. We find from Seneca, De Ben.\r\nB. ii. c. 12, and Pliny, B. xxxvii. c. 6, that Caligula wore gold and\r\npearls upon his socculi.\r\n\r\n[2638] Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8, states to this effect from Juba.\r\n\r\n[2639] They are found also, Ajasson says, at the present day, in some\r\nof the coldest rivers and torrents of Auvergne.\r\n\r\n[2640] Or “pinna,” the Greek name of this kind of pearl oyster.\r\n\r\n[2641] Cuvier remarks, that he is here probably speaking of some spiny\r\nbivalve, perhaps the Spondylus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2642] “Grandini.” But Hardouin thinks, and probably correctly,\r\nthat the meaning here of the word is the “measles of swine;” for\r\nAndrosthenes, in Athenæus, B. iii., has a similar passage, in which he\r\nsays: “The stone (_i. e._ pearl) grows in the flesh of the shell-fish,\r\njust as the measles grow in the flesh of swine.”\r\n\r\n[2643] He is also mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 12, and B. xxxvii. cc. 9,\r\n11, 23, 35, and 50, as a writer on gems; but nothing else seems to be\r\nknown of him.\r\n\r\n[2644] Cuvier observes, that most of the rivers and lakes of the north\r\nof Europe possess the mya margarifera: the pearls of which, though much\r\ninferior to those of the East, are sufficiently esteemed to be made an\r\narticle of commerce. Bad pearls, of a dead marble colour, are also very\r\nfrequently found in the mussels taken off our coasts. Pearls have in\r\nmodern times declined very considerably in value; those of about the\r\nsize of a large pea can be purchased, of very fine quality, for about\r\na guinea each, while those of the size of a pepper-corn sell at about\r\neighteen-pence. Seed pearls, of the size of small shot, are of very\r\nlittle value. Tavernier speaks of a remarkable pearl, that was found at\r\nCatifa, in Arabia, the fishery probably alluded to by Pliny, in C. 54,\r\nand which he bought for the sum of £110,000, some accounts say £10,000,\r\nof our money. It is pear-shaped, the elenchus of the ancients, regular,\r\nand without blemish. The diameter is .63 of an inch, at the largest\r\npart, and the length from two to three inches. It is said to be in the\r\npossession of the Shah of Persia.\r\n\r\n[2645] Tacitus, in his Agricola, says that pearls of a tawny and livid\r\ncolour are thrown up on the shores of Britain, and there collected.\r\nSuetonius absolutely says, c. 4, that Julius Cæsar invaded Britain in\r\nthe hope of obtaining pearls, in the weight and size of which he took\r\nconsiderable interest.\r\n\r\n[2646] By the inscription placed beneath the thorax, or breast-plate.\r\n\r\n[2647] The grand-daughter of M. Lollius, and heiress to his immense\r\nwealth. She was first married to C. Memmius Regulus; but was divorced\r\nfrom him, and married to the Emperor Caligula, who, however, soon\r\ndivorced her. At the instigation of Agrippina, Claudius first banished\r\nher, and then caused her to be murdered. A sepulchre to her honour was\r\nerected in the reign of the Emperor Nero.\r\n\r\n[2648] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2649] Or rather “betrothal entertainment,” “sponsalium cœna.” The\r\n“sponsalia” were not an unusual preliminary of marriage, but were not\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n[2650] 7,600,000 francs, Hardouin says; which would make £304,000 of\r\nour money.\r\n\r\n[2651] “Ipsa confestim parata mancupationem tabulis probare.”\r\n\r\n[2652] He was proprætor of the province of Galatia, Consul B.C. 21, and\r\nB.C. 16 legatus in Gaul; where he suffered a defeat from certain of the\r\nGerman tribes. He was afterwards appointed by Augustus tutor to his\r\ngrandson, C. Cæsar, whom he accompanied to the East in B.C. 2. He was a\r\npersonal enemy of Tiberius, which may in some measure account for the\r\nbad character given him by Velleius Paterculus, who describes him as\r\nmore eager to make money than to act honourably, and as guilty of every\r\nkind of vice. Horace, on the other hand, in the ode addressed to him,\r\nCarm. iv. 9, expressly praises him for his freedom from all avarice.\r\nHis son, M. Lollius, was the father of Lollia Paulina.\r\n\r\n[2653] This does not appear to be asserted by any other author; but\r\nVelleius Paterculus almost suggests as much, B.ii., “Cujus mors intra\r\npaucos dies fortuita an voluntaria fuerit ignoro.” It was said that\r\nhe was in the habit of selling the good graces of Caius Cæsar to the\r\nEastern sovereigns for sums of money.\r\n\r\n[2654] “Fercula.” See vol. i. p. 400, Note 3447.\r\n\r\n[2655] “Unam imperii mulierculam accubantem.”\r\n\r\n[2656] A fourth of the sum mentioned in Note 2650.\r\n\r\n[2657] “Corollarium.”\r\n\r\n[2658] “Et consumpturam eam cœnam taxationem confirmans.”\r\n\r\n[2659] “It was because pearls are calcareous, that Cleopatra was able\r\nto dissolve hers in vinegar, and by these means to gain a bet from her\r\nlover, as we are told by Pliny, B. ix. c. 58, and Macrobius, Sat. B.\r\nii. c. 13. She must, however, have employed stronger vinegar than that\r\nwhich we use for our tables; as pearls, on account of their hardness\r\nand their natural enamel, cannot be easily dissolved by a weak acid.\r\nNature has secured the teeth of animals against the effect of acids, by\r\nan enamel covering, which answers the same purpose; but if this enamel\r\nhappens to be injured only in one small place, the teeth soon spoil\r\nand rot. Cleopatra, perhaps, broke and pounded the pearls [pearl]; and\r\nit is probable that she afterwards diluted the vinegar with water,\r\nthat she might be able to drink it; though dissolved calcareous matter\r\nneutralizes acids, and renders them imperceptible to the tongue. That\r\npearls are not peculiar to one kind of shell-fish, as many believe, was\r\nknown to Pliny.” _Beckmann’s History of Inventions_, vol. i. p. 258,\r\nnote 1, _Bohn’s Ed._ We may remark, however that as the story is told\r\nby Pliny, there is no appearance that Cleopatra _pounded_ the pearl.\r\nIt is more likely that she threw it into the vinegar, and immediately\r\nswallowed it, taking it for granted that it had melted.\r\n\r\n[2660] Macrobius, Saturn. B. iii. says, “Monatius” Plancus. His name\r\nwas in reality Lucius Munatius Plancus. He afterwards deserted Antony,\r\nand took the side of Octavianus; and it was on his proposal that\r\nOctavianus received the title of Augustus in B.C. 27. He built the\r\ntemple of Saturn, in order to secure the emperor’s favour. It is not\r\nknown in what year he died.\r\n\r\n[2661] “Omine rato.” He means, that in the result, it was only too true\r\nthat Antony was “victus,” conquered, and that by his enemy Octavianus.\r\n\r\n[2662] Claudius, or Clodius Æsopus, was the most celebrated tragic\r\nactor at Rome in the time of Cicero, and was probably a freedman of\r\nthe Clodian family. Horace and other authors put him on a level with\r\nRoscius. From Cicero we learn that his acting was characterized chiefly\r\nby strong emphasis and vehemence. Cicero characterizes him as a “summus\r\nartifex,” a “consummate artist.” He was a firm friend of Cicero, whose\r\ncause he advocated indirectly more than once during his banishment from\r\nRome. It appears from Pliny, B. x. c. 72, that he was far from frugal,\r\nthough he left a large fortune to his spendthrift son, Clodius Æsopus.\r\nThis man, among his other feats, dissolved in vinegar (or at least\r\nattempted to do so), a pearl worth about £8000, which he took from the\r\near-ring of Cæcilia Metella. It is alluded to by Horace, B. ii. Sat.\r\niii. l. 239.\r\n\r\n[2663] Or “conchylium.” We find that Pliny generally makes a difference\r\nbetween the colours of the “murex,” or “conchylium,” and those of\r\nthe “purpura,” or “purple.” Cuvier says, that they were the names of\r\ndifferent shell-fish which the ancients employed for dyeing in purple\r\nof various shades. It is not known exactly, at the present day, what\r\nspecies they employed; but it is a fact well ascertained, that the\r\ngreater part of the univalve shell-fish, more especially the Buccini\r\nand Murices of Linnæus, distil a kind of red liquid. The dearness of\r\nit arose, Cuvier thinks, from the remarkably small quantity that each\r\nanimal afforded. Since the coccus, or kermes, he says, came to be well\r\nknown, and more especially since the New World has supplied us with\r\ncochineal, we are no longer necessitated to have recourse to the juices\r\nof the murex.\r\n\r\n[2664] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 14, says, “about six.” The murex\r\nof Pliny is the κήρυξ of Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[2665] Aristotle says, that the purple consists of three parts, the\r\nupper being the τράχηλος, or neck; the middle the μήκων, or poppy;\r\nand the lower the πυθμήν, or trunk; and that the juice lies between\r\nthe first and second of these parts, or the throat. This juice, which\r\nPliny calls “flos,” “flower,” “ros,” “dew,” and “succus,” “juice,” is\r\ndistilled, Cuvier says, not from the fauces of the animal, but from the\r\nmantle or membranous tissue which lines the shell.\r\n\r\n[2666] See B. v. c. 7. See also B. vi. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2667] Which preceded the Roman consuls, who were clothed with the toga\r\nprætexta, the colour of which was Syrian purple.\r\n\r\n[2668] Hardouin seems to think that “majestate pueritiæ” means\r\n“children of high birth;” but it was the fact that all children of free\r\nbirth wore the prætexta, edged with purple, till they attained puberty.\r\nIt is much more probable that by these words Pliny means the “majesty\r\nof youth,” in its simplicity and guileless nature, that commands our\r\nveneration and respect.\r\n\r\n[2669] He means that the purple laticlave or broad hem of the senator’s\r\ntoga distinguished him from the eques, who wore a toga with an\r\nangusticlave, or narrow hem.\r\n\r\n[2670] From Cicero, Epist. Ad. Attic. B. ii. Ep. 9, we learn that\r\npurple was worn by the priests when performing sacrifice. Ajasson,\r\nhowever, agrees with Dalechamps in thinking that this passage bears\r\nreference to the consuls, who wore purple when sacrificing to the gods.\r\n\r\n[2671] The prætexta, for instance, the laticlave, the chlamys, the\r\npaludamentum, and the trabea.\r\n\r\n[2672] On the occasion of a triumph, the victor was arrayed in a “toga\r\npicta,” an embroidered garment, which, from the present passage, would\r\nappear to have been of purple and gold. Pliny tells us, B. xxxiii. c.\r\n19, that Tarquinius, on his triumph over the Sabines, wore a robe of\r\ncloth of gold.\r\n\r\n[2673] Aristotle says the same, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 14, and De Partib.\r\nAnim. B. ii. c. 17. Cuvier says, that the buccinus and murex have a\r\nlong neck, in which there is a tongue armed with little teeth, but\r\nvery sharp, by means of which the animal is enabled to pierce other\r\nshell-fish.\r\n\r\n[2674] “Conchylia;” other fish of the same kind apparently; as Pliny\r\nuses the word “conchylium” synonymously with “murex.”\r\n\r\n[2675] “Præmia vitæ suæ.”\r\n\r\n[2676] Cuvier says that the buccini, properly so called, have at\r\nthe bottom of the orifice of the shell an incision, which is the\r\ncharacteristic of the genus. Our whelks are the best known specimen of\r\nthe buccinum that we have. They received their name, he says, from the\r\nbuccinum, or buccina, the conch-shell, (with which Triton is commonly\r\npainted), and that in its turn was so called from its resemblance to a\r\nbuccina, trumpet or herdsman’s horn.\r\n\r\n[2677] It is not the tongue, Cuvier says, that occupies this passage,\r\nbut a prolongation of the skin or coat that envelopes the animal, and\r\nits office is to conduct to the branchiæ the water necessary for the\r\npurposes of respiration.\r\n\r\n[2678] This description, Cuvier says, is applicable to the Murex\r\nbrandaris, the Murex tribulus of Linnæus, and other species that denote\r\ntheir growth by the increase of the spirals furnished with spines.\r\n\r\n[2679] Or “deep sea” purples. Dalechamps remarks, that Pliny here\r\nunwittingly gives to the purples in general, a name which only belonged\r\nto one species; there being some that only frequent the shore, and are\r\nnot found out at sea.\r\n\r\n[2680] “Lutensis.”\r\n\r\n[2681] “Algensis.”\r\n\r\n[2682] “Tæniensis.”\r\n\r\n[2683] “Calculensis.”\r\n\r\n[2684] From the Greek διαλυτὸς, “free,” or “roving;” in consequence of\r\nits peculiar mode of life.\r\n\r\n[2685] Nassis. See Note [2547] in p. 421.\r\n\r\n[2686] “Quum cerificavere.” Cuvier remarks that Aristotle, Hist.\r\nAnim. B. v. c. 14, says, that these shell-fish make “waxen combs,”\r\nmeaning thereby collections of cells, similar to those formed by the\r\nbee; and it is to this notion that Pliny refers in the use of the\r\nword “cerificavere.” It is the fact, Cuvier says, that the univalve\r\nsea shell-fish, and more particularly the buccini and the murices,\r\nenvelope their eggs with glutinous vesicles of varied forms, according\r\nto the respective species; which, when massed together, may be not\r\ninappropriately termed “combs.”\r\n\r\n[2687] In c. 60. As Cuvier remarks, with considerable justice, this\r\ndescription by Pliny of the process of dyeing in purple, is very\r\ndifficult to explain, seeing that the art is now entirely lost.\r\nReaumur, he says, made some attempts at dyeing with a small buccinum\r\nfound off the French coasts, the Buccinum lapillus of Linnæus; but\r\nwithout any result.\r\n\r\n[2688] About twenty ounces.\r\n\r\n[2689] Because iron or brazen vessels might impart a tinge to the\r\ncolour. The same would probably be the case if the word “plumbo” were\r\nto be considered as signifying “lead.” As, however, Pliny uses this\r\nword in the signification of “tin,” it is most probable that that is\r\nhis meaning. Littré, however, translates the word “plombe,” “lead.”\r\n\r\n[2690] Hardouin says, that the weight of the contents of the amphora\r\nwould be about eighty pounds: it would therefore take eight thousand\r\npounds of material to make five hundred pounds of dye. The passage,\r\nhowever, which runs as follows, “Fervere in plumbo, singulasque\r\namphoras centenas ad quingentenas medicaminis libras æquari,” may be\r\nrendered, “It is then set to boil in vessels of tin, and every hundred\r\namphoræ of water ought to be proportioned to five hundred pounds of the\r\nmaterial;” indeed, this is probably the correct translation, though\r\nLittré, who is generally very exact, adopts that given in the text.\r\n\r\n[2691] “Alligatur:” which word may also mean, that mixed with the\r\nbuccinum, it will hold fast, and not speedily fade or wash out.\r\n\r\n[2692] So called from the gem of that name; see B. xxxvii. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[2693] Aἵματι πορφυρέῳ. Il. Ρ. l. 360, for instance.\r\n\r\n[2694] The “trabea” was similar in cut to the toga, but was ornamented\r\nwith purple horizontal stripes. Servius mentions three kinds of trabea;\r\none wholly of purple, which was sacred to the gods, another of purple\r\nand white, and another of purple and saffron, which belonged to the\r\naugurs. The purple and white trabea was the royal robe, worn by the\r\nearly kings, and the introduction of which was assigned to Romulus. The\r\ntrabea was worn by the consuls in public solemnities, such as opening\r\nthe temple of Janus. The equites also wore it on particular occasions;\r\nand it is sometimes spoken of as the badge of the equestrian order.\r\n\r\n[2695] The latus clavus, or laticlave, was originally worn on\r\nthe tunic, and was a distinctive badge of the senatorian order.\r\nIt consisted of a single broad band of purple colour, extending\r\nperpendicularly from the neck down the centre of the tunic. The right\r\nof wearing the laticlave was given to children of the equestrian order,\r\nat least, as we learn from Ovid, in the reign of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2696] Hardouin says, that in his time there were still to be seen the\r\nremains of the ancient dyeing houses at Tarentum, the modern Otranto,\r\nand that vast heaps of the shells of the murex had been discovered\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[2697] Cloths doubly dyed, or twice dipped: from the Greek δὶς, twice,\r\nand βάπτω, to dip.\r\n\r\n[2698] “Triclinaria.” This word probably signified not only the\r\nhangings of the table couches, but the coverings, and the coverlets\r\nwhich were spread over the guests while at the meal.\r\n\r\n[2699] “Pro indiviso.”\r\n\r\n[2700] “Dimidia et medicamina adduntur.” This, no doubt, is the sense\r\nof the passage, as it is evident that only a thinner dye was required\r\nfor tint, though at first sight it would appear as though one-half more\r\nwere required for the same quantity of wool. The quantity therefore\r\nwould be 155-1/2 pounds of dye to fifty pounds of wool.\r\n\r\n[2701] “Tantoque dilutior, quanto magis vellera esuriunt.” This\r\nseems to be the meaning of the passage: some commentators would read\r\n“dilucidior” for “dilutior,” and it would appear to be preferable.\r\n\r\n[2702] There can be little doubt that Salmasius is right in his\r\nconjecture that the reading here should be “quingentos,” “five\r\nhundred,” instead of “quinquagenos,” “fifty:” as it is evident from\r\nwhat Pliny has said in previous Chapters, that the juices of the\r\npelagia were considerably more valuable than those of the buccinum.\r\n\r\n[2703] He states this by way of warning to those who are in the habit\r\nof paying enormous prices for dyes, such as one hundred denarii for a\r\npound, as mentioned in the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2704] This is mentioned more fully in B. xvi. c. 84.\r\n\r\n[2705] See B. xxxiii. c. 23. Electrum was an artificial metal,\r\nresembling amber in colour, and consisting of gold alloyed with\r\none-fifth part of silver.\r\n\r\n[2706] See B. xxxiv. c. 3. It was a mixture of gold, silver, and copper.\r\n\r\n[2707] Described at the end of c. 62.\r\n\r\n[2708] “Nomen improbum.”\r\n\r\n[2709] From the Greek ὕσγινος, after the herb hysge, which was used in\r\ndyeing. Judging from the present passage, it would almost appear to\r\nhave been the colour now known as puce. See B. xxi. c. 36 and c. 97;\r\nand B. xxxv. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[2710] See B. xvi. c. 8, and B. xxiv. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2711] See B. iv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[2712] This is in reality the Coccus ilicis of Linnæus, a small insect\r\nof the genus Coccus, the female of which, when impregnated, fastens\r\nitself to a tree from which they derive nourishment, and assumes the\r\nappearance of a small grain: on which account they were long taken for\r\nthe seeds of the tree, and were hence called grains of kermes. They\r\nare used as a red and scarlet dye, but are very inferior to cochineal,\r\nwhich has almost entirely superseded the use of the kermes. The colour\r\nis of a deep red, and will stand better than that of cochineal, and is\r\nless liable to stain.\r\n\r\n[2713] Or pina. The Pinna marina, Cuvier says, is a large bivalve\r\nshell-fish, which is remarkable for its fine silky hair, by means of\r\nwhich it fastens itself to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n[2714] The poet Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. l. 186, relates the same story\r\nabout the pinna and its protector; which is also mentioned by Cicero,\r\nPlutarch, and Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[2715] We have already had an account of one pinnotheres, in c. 51.\r\nSome of the editions, however, make a difference in the spelling of the\r\nname, and call the animal mentioned in the 51st Chapter, “pinnotheres,”\r\nand the one here spoken of, the “pinnoteres,” the “guardian of the\r\npinna;” from the Greek verb τηρέω, “to keep,” or “guard.” “Pinnophylax”\r\nhas the same meaning.\r\n\r\n[2716] Cuvier says, that in the shell of the pinna, as, in fact, of\r\nall the bivalves, there are often found little crabs, which are, as it\r\nwere, imprisoned there; and that it is this fact that has given rise\r\nto the story of the treaty of amity between these two animals, which\r\nappears in various authors, and is related in various forms, which only\r\nagree in being devoid of truth. Cuvier says that a careful distinction\r\nmust be made between the pinnotheres of this Chapter, the one of which\r\nAristotle makes mention, and that which is mentioned by Pliny in c. 51,\r\nthe hermit-crab of the moderns. There can, however, be but little doubt\r\nthat they are different accounts of the same animal.\r\n\r\n[2717] The whole, nearly, of this Chapter is taken from Aristotle, B.\r\nv. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2718] Plutarch speaks of this fish, in his “Treatise on the Instincts\r\nof Animals;” also Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. l. 62. The Raia torpedo of\r\nLinnæus, Cuvier says, has on each side of the body a galvanic organ,\r\nwhich produces an electric shock, similar to that communicated by the\r\nuse of the Leyden vial. By this means it baffles its enemies, and\r\ndrives them away; or else, having stupefied them, devours them at its\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\n[2719] Cuvier confirms this statement. The liver of the torpedo, he\r\nsays, is very delicate eating, as, indeed, is that part in most of the\r\nray genus.\r\n\r\n[2720] Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. l. 86; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 24;\r\nand Cicero, De Nat. Deor. make mention of this.\r\n\r\n[2721] The Lophius piscatorius of Linnæus, the baudroie of the French.\r\nThis is a fish, Cuvier says, with a large wide mouth, and having\r\nupon the top of the head moveable filaments, surmounted by a sort of\r\nmembranous lashes. It seems that it is the fact that it buries itself\r\nin the sand, and then employs the artifice here mentioned by Pliny, for\r\nthe purpose of attracting the fish that serve as its food.\r\n\r\n[2722] Or turbot. This fish, the Pleuronectes maximus of Linnæus, and\r\nthe Squalus squatina of Linnæus, presents no sufficiently distinct\r\nfilaments at the extremity of the fins to justify what Pliny says. But\r\nthe word “rhombus,” Cuvier says, which ordinarily means the common\r\nturbot, here means the psetta of the Greeks, the Pleuronectes rhombus\r\nof Linnæus, which has the anterior radii of the dorsal fin separated,\r\nand forming small filaments. For an account of the psetta, see c. 24,\r\np. 396.\r\n\r\n[2723] The sting-ray, the Raia pastinaca of Linnæus. This fish, Cuvier\r\nsays, has upon the tail a pointed spine, compressed and notched like a\r\nsaw, which forms a most dangerous weapon. It is again mentioned in c.\r\n72 of the present Book, under its Greek name of “trigon.”\r\n\r\n[2724] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 17, and B. ix. c. 51; Oppian,\r\nHalieut. B. ii. l. 424; and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 35, make a\r\nsimilar statement as to the scolopendra.\r\n\r\n[2725] The animal, Cuvier says, which is here mentioned as the\r\nscolopendra, is in reality of the class of worms that have red blood,\r\nor annelides, such, for instance, as the Nereides of larger size. These\r\nhaving on the sides tentacles, which bear a strong resemblance to feet,\r\nand sharp jaws, might, he says, be very easily taken for scolopendræ.\r\nThey have also a fleshy trunk, often very voluminous, and so flexible\r\nthat it can be extended or withdrawn, according to the necessities of\r\nthe animal. It is this trunk, Cuvier thinks, that gave occasion to the\r\nstory that it could disgorge its entrails, and then swallow them again.\r\n\r\n[2726] This fish, Cuvier says, was doubtless a species of squalus;\r\nwhich have the power, in consequence of the sharpness of their saw-like\r\nteeth, of cutting a line with the greatest ease. It is mentioned by\r\nAristotle, B. ix. c. 52; Ælian, Var. Hist. B. i. c. 43; and Oppian,\r\nHalieut. B. iii. l. 144.\r\n\r\n[2727] The fish that has been previously mentioned in c. 17 of this\r\nBook, under the name of silurus.\r\n\r\n[2728] “Aries.” The Delphinus orca of Linnæus. See c. 4 of the present\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2729] The zoöphytes, or the zoödendra.\r\n\r\n[2730] The wandering urticæ, or sea-nettles, are the Medusæ of Linnæus,\r\nthe stationary nettle is the Actinia of the same naturalist.\r\n\r\n[2731] “Carnosæ frondis his natura.”\r\n\r\n[2732] Many species of the medusæ, Cuvier says, and other animals\r\nof the same class, the physalus more especially, cause an itching\r\nsensation in the skin when they are touched. This is noticed also\r\nby Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 35; and by Diphilus of Siphnos, in\r\nAthenæus, B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2733] This is true, Cuvier says, and more especially with reference\r\nto the actiniæ. They have the mouth provided with numerous fleshy\r\ntentacles, by means of which they can seize very small animals which\r\ncome within their reach, which they instantly swallow.\r\n\r\n[2734] Cuvier says, that this is the case more especially with the\r\nmedusæ and the physali.\r\n\r\n[2735] “Ora ei in radice.” Aristotle, however, says, Hist. Anim. B.\r\niv. c. 5, and B. viii. c. 3, that the sea-nettle has the mouth situate\r\nἐν μέσῳ, “in the middle of the body.” Hardouin attempts to explain the\r\npassage on the ground that Pliny has made a mistake, in an endeavour\r\nto suit his similitude of a tree to the language of Aristotle. Cuvier\r\nsays, that there exists one genus or species of the medusæ, which\r\nappears to feed itself by the aid of an apparatus of branches, and is\r\ndivided into such a multitude of filaments, almost innumerable, that it\r\nbears a strong resemblance to the roots of a tree or vegetable. It is\r\nthis kind, he says, that he has called by the name of “Rhizostomos.”\r\n\r\n[2736] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 3, says the same; though,\r\non the other hand, in the Fourth Book, he says that the animal has no\r\nexcrements, although it has a mouth, and feeds.\r\n\r\n[2737] Cuvier remarks, that there are a great many more than three\r\nkinds of sponges, but that Pliny here is only enumerating those which\r\nwere employed for domestic use.\r\n\r\n[2738] In the singular, “tragus,” from the Greek τραγὸς, a goat, on\r\naccount of their strong smell, which they contract from the mud and\r\nslime in which they are found.\r\n\r\n[2739] Probably from the Greek μάνος, “rare,” “in small quantities;” in\r\nallusion to the comparative rarity of this kind of sponge.\r\n\r\n[2740] A term merely used, as Cælius Rhodiginus says, to denote the\r\nstrength of its texture.\r\n\r\n[2741] Cuvier says, that though sometimes shells and small animals are\r\nfound lodged in the sponge, they do not afford it any nourishment.\r\nHaving no mouth, it can only live and increase by the inhalation of\r\nsubstances dissolved in the water of the sea.\r\n\r\n[2742] “Sensere.” Cuvier says, that many observers have stated that\r\nthis is the only sign of animal life that the sponge affords; but\r\nthat Grant assures us that it does not even afford that. The fact\r\nis, however, that “the sponge itself is a cellular, fibrous tissue,\r\nproduced by small animals, almost imperceptible, called polypi, and\r\nliving in the sea. This tissue is said to be covered in its native\r\nstate with a sort of semifluid thin coat of animal jelly, susceptible\r\nof a slight contraction or trembling on being touched; which, in fact,\r\nis the only symptom of vitality displayed by the sponge. After death,\r\nthis gelatinous substance disappears, and leaves only the skeleton or\r\nsponge, formed by the combination of a multitude of small capillary\r\ntubes, capable of receiving water in the interior, and of becoming\r\nthereby distended. Though different in their nature, sponges are\r\nanalogous in their formation to coral. On being examined with a power\r\nof about 500 linear, the fleshy matter of the living sponge is to be\r\ndistinctly observed, having in its interior gemmæ, which are considered\r\nto be the young. These are occasionally given off from the mass of\r\nliving matter. The greater portion of the mass of sponge consists of\r\nsmall cylindrical threads or fibres, varying in size. The spiculæ\r\nare not found within these, but in the large and flattened fibres,\r\nand varying in number from one to three or more, imbedded in their\r\nsubstance.” _From Brande’s Dictionary._\r\n\r\n[2743] See B. iv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2744] This, to the end of the Chapter, is almost verbatim from\r\nAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2745] See B. iv. cc. 8, 10.\r\n\r\n[2746] Ἀπλυσίαι, from ἀ, “not,” and πλύνω, “to wash.” These aplysiæ or\r\nhalcyones, Cuvier says, are a kind of sponge, of too thick and compact\r\na nature to admit of their being washed. It is arbitrarily, he says,\r\nthat Linnæus has applied this name to a species of the molluscæ, which\r\nis, in reality, the sea-hare of the ancients.\r\n\r\n[2747] It is pretty clear that under the name of “canicula,”\r\n“dog-fish,” or “canis marinus,” “sea-dog,” Pliny includes the whole\r\ngenus of sharks.\r\n\r\n[2748] Rondelet and Dalechamps absolutely interpret this passage as\r\nthough it were the dog-fish and flat-fish over whose eyes this cloud\r\ncomes, and the latter proceeds to describe it as a malady which hinders\r\nthe fish from taking its own part in the combat. Hardouin, however,\r\ndetects this absurdity, and justly reprehends it; though it must be\r\nconfessed that there is some obscurity in the passage, arising from the\r\nway in which it is worded.\r\n\r\n[2749] Cuvier thinks it not improbable that it may have been some of\r\nthe large rays that were seen by the divers, and more especially, the\r\nlargest of them all, the Cephalopterus.\r\n\r\n[2750] “Stilos.”\r\n\r\n[2751] Cælius Rhodigonus, B. xxv. c. 16, states that the divers for\r\nsponges were in the habit of pouring forth oil at the bottom of the\r\nsea, for the purpose of increasing the light there; and Pliny states\r\nthe same in B. ii. c. 106.\r\n\r\n[2752] Cuvier says, that the name of “sacred fish” has been given to\r\nseveral fish of very different character; such as the anthias, or\r\naulopias of Aristotle, B. ix. c. 37, the pompilus and the dolphin\r\n(Athenæus, B. vii.), because it was thought that their presence was a\r\nguarantee against the vicinity of dangerous fish. The authors, however,\r\nthat were consulted by Pliny, seem to have given this name to the\r\nflat-fish, the Pleuronectes of Linnæus; and in fact, unprovided as they\r\nare with any means of defence, their presence is not unlikely to prove,\r\nin a very great degree, the absence of the voracious class of fishes.\r\n\r\n[2753] It is singular that Pliny, after his numerous stories as to\r\nthe sensitiveness of numerous bivalves, should make this statement in\r\nreference to the oyster; for, on the contrary, as Cuvier says, the\r\noyster, in common with the other bivalves, is extremely sensitive to\r\nthe touch.\r\n\r\n[2754] Cuvier says, that the different zoöphytes, the sea-star, at\r\nleast, are far from having the life of vegetables only; for that they\r\nare real animals, which have the sense of touch, a voluntary power of\r\nmotion more or less complete, and seize and devour their prey. It is\r\nnot, however, very well known, he says, what was the “holothurium” of\r\nthe ancients. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 1, ranks it, as well as\r\nthe oyster, among the animals which, without being attached to any\r\nobject, have not the faculty of moving; and in his work, De Part. Anim.\r\nB. iv. c. 5, he adds, that the holothurium and the pulmo only differ\r\nfrom the sponge in being detached. Cuvier is of opinion, however, that\r\nthey both belong to the halcyones, the round kinds of which easily\r\ndetach themselves from the places upon which they have grown.\r\n\r\n[2755] Pulmo, “the sea-lungs.”\r\n\r\n[2756] Or, as we call it, the star-fish.\r\n\r\n[2757] “Adeoque nihil non gignitur in mari.”\r\n\r\n[2758] “Cauponarum.” “Caupona” had two significations; that of an\r\ninn where travellers obtained food and lodging, and that of a shop\r\nwhere wine and ready-dressed meat were sold. A lower kind of inn was\r\nthe popina, which was principally frequented by the slaves and lower\r\nclasses, and was mostly used as a brothel as well.\r\n\r\n[2759] He alludes to various kinds of sea-animals, called sea-lice and\r\nsea-fleas. Cuvier says, that there are some crustacea which have been\r\ncalled sea-fleas and sea-lice, some of which kinds are parasites, and\r\nare attached to various fishes and cetacea. Thus, he says, a pycnogonum\r\nis commonly named “pediculus balænæ,” or the “whale-louse;” one of the\r\ncalygæ is called the “fish-flea,” another the “mackerel-flea.” The name\r\nof sea-flea, he observes, has been given more especially to a very\r\ndiminutive kind of shrimp, in consequence of its power of leaping from\r\nplace to place.\r\n\r\n[2760] Aristotle says, that the chalcis is greatly tormented by\r\nsea-fleas, which attach themselves to its gills. Cuvier remarks, that\r\na great number of fish are subject to have the gills attacked by\r\nparasitical animals of the genus Lernæa or that of the monoculi of\r\nLinnæus, which have been divided into many classes since. They have\r\nnothing in common, he says, with the land-flea, except the name and the\r\nproperty of living at the expense of other animals.\r\n\r\n[2761] The ancients, Cuvier says, speak of their chalcis as being of\r\na similar nature to the thryssa and the sardine (Athenæus, B. vii.),\r\ngregarious fishes, which live both in the sea and in fresh water, and\r\nthe flesh of which was salted. Hence he concludes that it was the\r\nsame as the Clupea ficta of Lacepède, the “finte” of the French, and\r\nthe agone of Lombardy, which unites all these characteristics, and is\r\nsometimes called the “sardine” of the Lago di Garda.\r\n\r\n[2762] It is mentioned again in B. xxiii. c. 3. Cuvier says, that\r\nthe sea-hare of the ancients is the mollusc to which Linnæus has\r\ninjudiciously given the name of aplysia, which Pliny gives to certain\r\nof the sponge genus, and to which nomenclature of Linnæus the modern\r\nnaturalists have assented. (See N. [2746], p. 456.) Its tentacles and\r\nits muzzle, he says, resemble the muzzle and ears of the hare, closely\r\nenough to have caused this appellation. As its smell is disagreeable,\r\nand its figure repulsive, a multitude of marvellous, and indeed fatal\r\nqualities, he says, have been ascribed to this animal, which fishermen\r\nstill speak of, but which, nevertheless, are not confirmed by actual\r\nexperience. The only true fact that can be alleged against it is, that\r\nit secretes from an organ, situate in its body, a kind of acrid liquid.\r\nAs to the Indian sea-hare, the body of which was covered with hair,\r\nCuvier professes himself quite at a loss to know what it might be; but\r\nhe thinks that this name must have been given to some tetrodon, which\r\nmay have received the name from the cleft in the jaw and the skin,\r\nbristling with fine and minute spines. The sailors, he says, attribute\r\nto the tetrodon certain venomous properties.\r\n\r\n[2763] Cuvier says, that there is reason to believe that this is the\r\nsame as the vive of the French (probably our weever), the Trachinus\r\ndraco of Linnæus. This creature, with the spiny projections of its\r\nfirst dorsal fin, is able to inflict wounds that are extremely\r\ndifficult to cure; not because they are venomous in any degree,\r\nbut because the extremities being very minute, sharp, and pointed,\r\npenetrate deep into the flesh. See c. 43 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2764] Or sting-ray, mentioned in c. 40 and c. 67 of this Book; so\r\ncalled from the Greek τρυγὼν. Cuvier says, that this sting, or spine,\r\nis sharp, like a saw; and that when it has penetrated the flesh, it\r\ncannot be got out without enlarging the wound. This it is, and not its\r\nfancied poisonous qualities, that renders its wound so dangerous; and\r\nas for its action upon trees and iron, they are entirely fabulous.\r\n\r\n[2765] Νοσήματα λοιμώδη, as Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 25,\r\ncalls them.\r\n\r\n[2766] Cuvier says, that there are some maladies by which individuals\r\nare attacked; but that it is not uncommonly the case that certain\r\nspecies are attacked universally, as it were, by a sort of epidemic.\r\nThere was an instance of this, he says, in the lake of the valley\r\nof Montmorency, where numbers of the fish were suddenly to be seen\r\nfloating dead on the surface, the skin of which was covered with red\r\nspots, while at the same time their flesh had become disagreeable to\r\nthe taste, and unwholesome.\r\n\r\n[2767] Cuvier says, that this is not the case in general; but that\r\nsome, more especially those which are viviparous, actually do couple;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, in most, the male does nothing else but\r\nbesprinkle with the milt the eggs which the female has deposited, as is\r\nstated by Pliny a little further on.\r\n\r\n[2768] These belong to the cetacea; which, as Cuvier says, are now\r\nuniversally placed among the mammifera, and not among the fishes. They\r\ncouple, he says, in the same manner as quadrupeds do in general.\r\n\r\n[2769] As Aristotle says, “from those that are left the fishes are\r\nproduced.”\r\n\r\n[2770] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[2771] It has been calculated, Cuvier says, that a female cod, or\r\nsturgeon, produces in a year more than one hundred thousand eggs.\r\n\r\n[2772] Cuvier says, that the eggs of the common fishes, of toads,\r\nfrogs, &c., have no shells, but only a membranous tunic; and when they\r\nhave been once fecundated, they imbibe the surrounding moisture, and\r\nincrease till they produce the animal.\r\n\r\n[2773] It is probable, Cuvier thinks, that this passage relates more\r\nespecially to the ray genus, but that there is no very positive\r\nknowledge as to the mode in which they do couple. It is probable, he\r\nsuggests, that they may do it in the manner above mentioned, by the\r\nattrition of the belly. As to the turtle genus, he says, it is certain\r\nthat the male mounts the back of the female; and in some species the\r\nsternum of the male is concave, the better to adapt itself to the\r\nconvex callipash of the female.\r\n\r\n[2774] More properly, the physeter, passage, or orifice.\r\n\r\n[2775] Cuvier remarks, that this account of the coupling of the\r\ncephalopodes is taken from Aristotle. He says, that he is not aware\r\nwhether modern observation has confirmed these statements, and almost\r\ndoubts whether, considering the organization of these animals, it is\r\nnot almost more probable that they do not couple at all, and that the\r\nmale, as in the case of most other fishes, only fecundates the eggs\r\nafter they have been deposited by the female.\r\n\r\n[2776] Cuvier says, that whatever may be the sense in which the word\r\n“mollia” is here taken, the assertion is not correct. The gasteropod\r\nmolluscs, he says, whether hermaphroditical, or whether of separate\r\nsexes, couple side to side. The acephalous molluscs do not couple at\r\nall, and each individual fecundates its own eggs. The crustacea couple\r\nby attrition of the belly.\r\n\r\n[2777] “Tadpoles.” There is both truth and falsehood, Cuvier says,\r\nin the statements here made relative to the tadpole. Frogs, he says,\r\nproduce eggs, from which the tadpole developes itself, with a tail like\r\nthat of a fish. The feet, however, are not produced by any bifurcation\r\nof the tail, but shoot out at the base of the tail, and in the same\r\nproportion that they grow, the tail decreases, till at last it entirely\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\n[2778] Frogs, Cuvier says, conceal themselves in mud and slime during\r\nthe winter, but, of course, are not changed into it.\r\n\r\n[2779] “Quæ fuere.” Just in the same state, he probably means to say,\r\nin which they were when they were melted into slime, and not as they\r\nwere when in the tadpole state.\r\n\r\n[2780] All that is asserted here, Cuvier says, about the spontaneous\r\noperations of nature is totally false. Everything connected with the\r\neggs and the generation of the mussel, the murex, and the scallop is\r\nnow clearly ascertained.\r\n\r\n[2781] “Acescente humore.” Hardouin has suggested that the proper\r\nreading may be “arescente humore”—“from moisture dried up;” for, he\r\nremarks, Aristotle, in his Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 18, states, that the\r\n“empides,” gnats formed from the ascarides in the slime of wells, are\r\nmore frequently produced in the autumn season.\r\n\r\n[2782] The apuæ, or aphyæ, Cuvier says, are nothing else but the fry of\r\nfish of a large kind.\r\n\r\n[2783] Cuvier says, that some of the shell-fish deposit their eggs upon\r\nstakes and piles, which are driven down into the water among sea-weed,\r\nand the bottoms of old ships: but that many of them perish from the\r\nsolutions formed by those bodies in a state of rottenness, or, at all\r\nevents, are not produced from their decomposition.\r\n\r\n[2784] “Ostreariis.” This was unknown to Aristotle, who, in his work De\r\nGener. Anim. B. iii. c. 11, expressly denies that the oyster secretes\r\nany generative or fecundating liquid.\r\n\r\n[2785] Cuvier says, that at the time of the oyster spawning, its\r\nbody appears swollen in some parts with a milky fluid, which is not\r\nimprobably the fecundating fluid. During this season the oyster is\r\ngenerally looked upon as unfit for food; among us, from the beginning\r\nof May to the end of July.\r\n\r\n[2786] This, Cuvier remarks, is a mere vague hypothesis, as to the\r\nreproduction of the eel, without the slightest foundation. Pliny\r\nborrows it from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2787] The squatina and the ray do not interbreed, Cuvier observes, any\r\nmore than other fish; and the Squatina raia, or rhinobatis, (which was\r\nsaid to be their joint production), is a particular species, more flat\r\nin form than the squalus, and longer than the ray.\r\n\r\n[2788] Ῥινόβατος, “the squatinoraia.”\r\n\r\n[2789] “Lupus.” The Perca labrax of Linnæus; see c. 28 of the present\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2790] The sardine. See c. 20 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2791] See c. 71 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2792] This name, Cuvier says, appears so rarely in the ancient\r\nwriters, that it is difficult to ascertain its exact signification.\r\nThe moderns, he says, have pretty generally agreed to give it to the\r\ncarp, but without any good and sufficient foundation. It was a lake\r\nor river fish, which, as Aristotle says, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 14,\r\ndeposited its eggs five or six times in the year, and which had a\r\npalate so fleshy, that it might almost be mistaken for a tongue, B. iv.\r\nc. 8, characteristics that appear well suited to the carp. But then, on\r\nthe other hand, Oppian mentions it, Halieut. B. i., as a shore fish,\r\nimplying apparently that it belonged to the sea; and Pliny himself, in\r\nc. 25 of the present Book, does the same, by his words, “hoc et in mari\r\naccidere cyprino.” The words “in mari,” however, he has added, of his\r\nown accord, to the account which he has derived from Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[2793] The fish called the sea-scorpion. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v.\r\nc. 11.\r\n\r\n[2794] “Sola autumno, occasu Vergiliarum.” It seems questionable\r\nwhether the reading should not be “solea:” “the sole in autumn, at the\r\nsetting of the Vergiliæ.”\r\n\r\n[2795] The Pleiades.\r\n\r\n[2796] See c. 40 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2797] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2798] “Prosequitur afflatu.” Aristotle says that it pours over them\r\nits ink or atramentum, καταφυσᾷ τὸν θόλον.\r\n\r\n[2799] Philostratus, Hist. B. v. c. 17, says that so full is it of\r\neggs, that after it is dead they will more than fill a vessel far\r\nlarger than the cavities of its head.\r\n\r\n[2800] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[2801] Our periwinkles.\r\n\r\n[2802] All the chondropterygian fishes, Cuvier says, have, in addition\r\nto their ovaries, real oviducts, which the ordinary fishes have not;\r\nthe lower part of which, being detached, acts as the uterus, into which\r\nthe eggs descend when they have gained their proper size: and it is\r\nhere that the young ones burst forth from the egg, when the parent\r\nanimal is viviparous.\r\n\r\n[2803] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 13, says the same of the\r\nglanis, or silurus.\r\n\r\n[2804] The Syngnathus acus of Linnæus. This fish, Cuvier says, and in\r\ngeneral all of the same genus, has a channel situate under the tail,\r\nwhich is opened by two moveable valves. In this they deposit their eggs\r\nat the moment of excluding them. After this, the valves open, to give a\r\npassage to the eggs, or the young enclosed in them. This circumstance,\r\nhe says, gave rise to the notion mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n[2805] Mentioned in c. 35 of the present Book. Cuvier says that the\r\nsea tortoises, or turtles, to which no doubt this animal belonged, do\r\ndeposit their eggs much in the way here mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2806] Both these fishes have been mentioned in c. 23 of the present\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2807] Pliny means to say, Cuvier says, that all these fish are to be\r\nlooked upon as females: and, in fact, he says, Cavolini discovered eggs\r\nand a milt in every one that he examined; so that they appear to have\r\nall the appliances of self-fecundation.\r\n\r\n[2808] Or wheel-fish: from the Greek τροχὸς, “a wheel.” It is not\r\nclearly known what animal he alludes to under this name. Snails, Cuvier\r\nsays, are hermaphrodites, and so is the helix, but still they require\r\nsexual connection for the purposes of reproduction. The greater part of\r\nthe marine uni-valves, on the other hand, are of separate sexes; but\r\nthe organ of the male being proportionally of great length, and coiled\r\nin part beneath its mantle, this fact may very possibly have given rise\r\nto the notion here mentioned by our author, that the animal impregnates\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[2809] This can only be understood, Cuvier says, as applying to those\r\nanimals the young of which are still enveloped in the membranes of the\r\negg; for in general, the young of fish, from the moment of their birth,\r\nhave eyes of great beauty, and are remarkable for the quickness of\r\ntheir sight.\r\n\r\n[2810] From the Greek παυσίλυπον, “grief-assuaging.” This was the name\r\nof a splendid villa belonging to Vedius Pollio, and which he bequeathed\r\nto Augustus. It was famous for its fish preserves; and it was here\r\nprobably that Pollio kept his murenæ, previously mentioned by Pliny as\r\nbeing fed on human flesh. The vicinity is still called Monte Posilipo.\r\n\r\n[2811] “Cæsaris piscinis.” This may either mean, preserves which had\r\ntheir name from Cæsar, or preserves which afterwards belonged to Cæsar.\r\nThe work of Seneca, in which this circumstance was mentioned, is no\r\nlonger in existence.\r\n\r\n[2812] He was a contemporary of L. Crassus, and was distinguished for\r\nhis great wealth, and his love of luxury and refinement, but possessed\r\nan unblemished character. His surname, Orata or Aurata, was given to\r\nhim, it is said, because he was remarkably fond of gold-fish—auratæ\r\npisces—though, according to other authorities, it was because he was in\r\nthe habit of wearing two very large gold rings.\r\n\r\n[2813] “Pensiles balineas.” This expression has been differently\r\nrendered by various commentators, but it is now generally supposed to\r\nrefer to the manner in which the flooring of the bathing rooms was\r\nsuspended over the hollow cells of the hypocaust or heating furnace.\r\nThis is called by Vitruvius, “Suspensura caldariorum.”\r\n\r\n[2814] “Ita mangonicatas villas subinde vendendo.”—By the use of the\r\nword “ita,” Pliny may possibly mean that he was in the habit of filling\r\nup the villas with the “balineæ pensiles,” which he had invented.\r\n“Mangonizo” was to set off or trim up a thing, that it might sell again\r\nall the better.\r\n\r\n[2815] Varro speaks of those of Tarentum, as being the best. The Greeks\r\npreferred the oysters of Abydos; the Romans, under the empire, those of\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n[2816] It does not appear to be known what two bridges are here alluded\r\nto; the Sublician, or wooden bridge, was probably one of them, and,\r\nperhaps, the Palatine bridge was the other. The former was built by\r\nAncus Martius.\r\n\r\n[2817] For some further account of the British oyster, see B. xxxii. c.\r\n21.\r\n\r\n[2818] See B. xxxii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2819] He was the first of this family, a branch of the Licinian gens,\r\nwho bore the surname of Murena, from his love for that fish, it was\r\nsaid. He, like his father P. Licinius, attained the rank of prætor, and\r\nwas a contemporary of the orator, L. Crassus.\r\n\r\n[2820] “Euripum.”\r\n\r\n[2821] “Xerxen togatum,” or “the Roman Xerxes,” in allusion to Xerxes\r\ncutting a canal through the Isthmus, which connected the Peninsula of\r\nMount Athos with Chalcidice. See B. iv. c. 17, and the Note, vol. i. p.\r\n300.\r\n\r\n[2822] Probably the same person as the C. Hirrius Posthumius, who is\r\nmentioned as a voluptuary by Cicero, De Fin. B. ii. c. 22, § 70. Varro\r\nspeaks of him, as expending the rent of his houses, amounting to twelve\r\nmillions of sesterces, in bait for his murenæ.\r\n\r\n[2823] This is, probably, the meaning of “quadragies” here, though it\r\nhas been translated 400,000.\r\n\r\n[2824] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2825] Porphyry, Tzetzes, and Macrobius relate the same story.\r\n\r\n[2826] See B. vii. c. 18, and B. xxxv. c. 36. Her grandson, Caligula,\r\nis supposed to have hastened her death.\r\n\r\n[2827] Hirpinius is the more common reading. He is mentioned in B.\r\nviii. c. 78. If the reading “Lupinus” is adopted, nothing seems to be\r\nknown of this epicurean trifler.\r\n\r\n[2828] Our periwinkles.\r\n\r\n[2829] See B. iii. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2830] Off the coast of Africa, see B. v. c. 1. These periwinkles, or\r\nsea-snails, are again mentioned in B. xxx. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[2831] “Sapa.” Must, or new wine, boiled down to one half, according to\r\nPliny; and one third, according to Varro.\r\n\r\n[2832] The “quadrans” contained three cyathi, and was the fourth part\r\nof a sextarius, which consisted of about a pint and a-half; in which\r\ncase the contents of one of their shells would be no less than fifteen\r\nquarts!! A statement to which no credit can be attached, unless,\r\nindeed, the sea-snail was something quite different to our periwinkle.\r\n\r\n[2833] Cuvier remarks, that nothing is known of the fish of the\r\nEuphrates here mentioned by Pliny from Theophrastus; as, indeed, all\r\nparticulars relative to the fresh-water fish of foreign countries are\r\nthe portion of Ichthyology with which we are the least acquainted.\r\nJudging, however, from what is stated as to their habits and\r\nappearance, they may he various species of the genus Gobius of Linnæus,\r\nand more especially the one called periophthalmus by Bloch. These\r\nspecies are in the habit of crawling along the grass on the banks of\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n[2834] Generally considered the same as our gudgeon. It is called\r\n“cobio” (from the Greek κωβιὸς), by Pliny, in B. xxxii. c. 53. It was a\r\nworthless fish, “Vilis piscis,” as Juvenal says.\r\n\r\n[2835] What Heraclea, if that is the correct reading, is meant here, it\r\nis impossible to say. Cromna is mentioned in B. vi. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2836] Cuvier thinks, that Pliny here alludes to a species of loche,\r\nthe Cobitis fossilis of Linnæus, which keeps itself concealed in the\r\nmud, and can survive a long time in it, after the water above it is\r\nabsorbed. Hence it is often found alive in the mud of drained marshes,\r\nor in the dried-up beds of rivers.\r\n\r\n[2837] Cuvier remarks, that many fish, the orifice of the gills of\r\nwhich, like those of the eel, is small, or which have in the interior\r\nof those parts organs proper for the preservation there of water,\r\nare able, like the eel, to live for some time on dry land; such, for\r\ninstance, as the periophthalmi previously mentioned, the chironectes,\r\nthe ophicephali, the anabas, and others; but it is difficult to say,\r\nhe observes, of what species were those of the Lycus, which are here\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[2838] Or turtle. See c. 12 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2839] It is most probable that Sillig is right in his supposition,\r\nthat “quam” should be read “æquam;” otherwise it does not appear that\r\nany sense can be made of the passage. Schneider, in his commentaries\r\nupon Theophrastus, Sillig says, quite despaired of either amending or\r\nexplaining this passage; which, however, with Sillig’s emendation is\r\nvery easily to be understood.\r\n\r\n[2840] In accordance with the opinion of Vossius and Sillig, we read\r\nhere “in illis,” instead of the common, and most probably incorrect,\r\nreading, “in nullis.”\r\n\r\n[2841] Pomponius Mela, B. i. c. 9., and Ovid, Met. B. i. l. 422, _et\r\nseq._, tell the same story, which, however, has no truth in it whatever.\r\n\r\n[2842] B. v. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[2843] Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. c. 305, et seq., tells a similar story\r\nas to the mode of taking the anthias, with some slight variation,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n[2844] “Damni formulam editam.”\r\n\r\n[2845] Cuvier says, that the star-fish, the Asterias of Linnæus, is\r\ncovered with a callous shell without, and has within only the viscera\r\nand the ovaria, apparently without any muscles. Aristotle reckons it\r\namong the fishes which he calls ὀστρακοδέρματα, or hard-shelled fish;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xi. c. 22, reckons it\r\namong the μαλακόστρακα, or soft-shelled fish.\r\n\r\n[2846] Cuvier says, that Pliny has good reason to say that he does\r\nnot know upon what authority this power has been attributed to the\r\nstar-fish; as it is altogether fabulous.\r\n\r\n[2847] “Or finger.” The same fish that have been mentioned as “ungues,”\r\nor “onyches,” in c. 51 of the present Book. They are a multivalve\r\nshell-fish, Cuvier says, which live in hardened mud or the interior of\r\nrocks, into which they burrow cavities, from which they cannot retreat;\r\nand they can only be taken by breaking the stone. They have a flavour\r\nlike pepper, and give out a phosphorescent light. See the end of c. 51.\r\n\r\n[2848] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 3. Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. v. c.\r\n48.\r\n\r\n[2849] Aristotle says, that the tail of the conger is bitten by the\r\nmurena, but not that of the murena by the conger. Hardouin suggests\r\nthat Pliny may have learned this fact from the works of Nigidius\r\nFigulus.\r\n\r\n[2850] Cuvier remarks, that in another passage, B. xi. c. 62, Pliny\r\nstates that the “musculus qui balænam antecedit” has no teeth, but\r\nonly bristles in its mouth. Now, in B. xxxii. c. 53, he speaks of the\r\nmusculus as among the largest of animals; from which Cuvier concludes\r\nit to have been a species of whale, probably the “rorqual” of the\r\nMediterranean. In confirmation of this, he thinks that the word\r\n“antecedit,” in B. xi. c. 62. has not the meaning of “goes before,” but\r\n“exceeds in size;” though here it is spoken of as leading the whale;\r\nand Oppian, Ælian, Plutarch, Claudian, speak of the conductor of the\r\nwhale as a little fish. He is of opinion, in fine, that either Pliny\r\nor some of the authors from which he has borrowed, have made a mistake\r\nin the name, and probably given that of “musculus,” which was really a\r\nlarge fish, to a small one, which was commonly supposed to attend on\r\nthe movements of the whale.\r\n\r\n[2851] It is evident from this passage, that Pliny is speaking of a\r\nlittle fish here, and not one to which he would assign such bulk as is\r\nascribed to the musculus in B. xxxii. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[2852] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2853] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2854] Caius Cilnius Mecænas, or rather Mæcenas, a descendant of the\r\nkings of Etruria, and of equestrian rank.

The quadrupeds, he says, are not so numerous,\r\nand are known from their characteristics. The fishes also, which the\r\nancients so highly esteemed as an article of food, were well known to\r\nthem in general, and they have repeated occasions to speak of them:\r\nbut as to the birds, the augurs were their principal informants.\r\nPliny, in fact, often quotes their testimony; and we find, from what\r\nhe says, that these men had not come to any agreement among themselves\r\nas to what were the names of divers species of birds, the movements\r\nof which announced, according to them, the success or misfortune of\r\nstates equally with individuals. This portion, in fact, of the works\r\nof Pliny, Cuvier remarks, is an excellent commentary on the remark of\r\nCicero, who, an augur himself, asked the question, how two augurs could\r\nlook each other in the face without laughing. There are also several\r\npassages from Aristotle, who has, however, given but very little\r\nattention to the exterior characteristics of birds: it is only from the\r\nsimilarity of their habits and present names that we are able, in many\r\ncases, to guess what bird it is that is meant.\r\n\r\n[2879] “Struthiocamelus;” from the Greek, signifying a “little\r\nsparrow,” and a “camel.” Cuvier remarks, that Pliny’s description is\r\ncorrect, and that he is only mistaken in a few slight particulars.\r\n\r\n[2880] Pliny perhaps here uses the conjunction “vel” in the explanatory\r\nsense of “otherwise;” intending to distinguish Æthiopian Africa from\r\nthe Roman province of that name.\r\n\r\n[2881] Cuvier remarks, that there is some truth in this, so far as\r\nthat the ostrich has only two toes, like the stag and other ruminating\r\nanimals; but then they are unequal in size, and not covered with hoofs.\r\n\r\n[2882] Father Lobo, in his account of Abyssinia, says that when the\r\nostrich is running at great speed, it throws the stones behind with\r\nsuch violence, that they would almost seem to be thrown at those in\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\n[2883] An ostrich, Cuvier says, will swallow anything, but it is by no\r\nmeans able to digest everything. He says, that he has seen ostriches\r\nwith the stomach ruptured by nails which they have swallowed, or\r\ndreadfully torn by pieces of glass.\r\n\r\n[2884] It has been remarked by Diodorus Siculus, B. ii., that so far\r\nfrom displaying stupidity in acting thus, it adopts a wise precaution,\r\nits head being its most weak and defenceless part.\r\n\r\n[2885] Cuvier states that its egg is equal to twenty-four to\r\ntwenty-eight fowls’ eggs, and that he had frequently eaten of them, and\r\nfound them very delicate.\r\n\r\n[2886] “Ferunt.” With regard to this verb, Cuvier remarks, that it is\r\nequivocal; and that it is very possible that the writer intends to say,\r\nnot that India and Æthiopia _produce_ these marvellous birds, but that\r\nthe people of those countries _report_ or _relate_ marvellous stories\r\ntouching those birds. It is clear that he does not believe in the\r\nexistence of the phœnix.\r\n\r\n[2887] Cuvier remarks, that all these relations are neither more nor\r\nless than so many absurd fables or pure allegories, but that the\r\ndescription given is exactly that of a bird which does exist, the\r\ngolden pheasant, namely. The description given is probably taken from\r\nthe pretended phœnix that Pliny mentions as having been brought to Rome\r\nin the reign of Claudius. It is not improbable, he thinks, that this\r\nmay have been a golden pheasant, brought from the interior of Asia,\r\nwhen the pursuits of commerce had as yet hardly extended so far, and to\r\nwhich those who showed it gave, most probably, the name of the phœnix.\r\nAjasson is of opinion, that under the story of the phœnix an allegory\r\nwas concealed, and thinks it may not improbably have been employed to\r\npourtray the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. Bailly, _Hist.\r\nde l’Astronomie_, thinks that it bore reference to the great canicular\r\nyear of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n[2888] Borrowed from Herodotus, B. ii. c. 73.\r\n\r\n[2889] The MSS. vary considerably as to the number. Some make it 540\r\nyears, others 511, others 40, and others 560.\r\n\r\n[2890] Mentioned also, B. vii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[2891] 532 years, according to Hardouin. Bailly says: “The first men\r\nwho studied the heavens remarked that the revolution of the sun brought\r\nback the seasons in the same order. They thought that they observed\r\nthat certain variations of the temperature depended upon the aspect of\r\nthe moon, and attached different prognostics to the rising and setting\r\nof the stars, persuading themselves that the vicissitudes of things\r\nhere below had regulated periods, like the movements of the heavenly\r\nbodies. From this arose the impression, that the same aspect, the same\r\narrangement of all the stars, that had prevailed at the commencement\r\nof the world, would also attend its destruction; and that the period\r\nof this long revolution was the predestined duration of the life of\r\nnature. Another impression was the idea that the world would only\r\nperish at this epoch to be born again, and for the same order of things\r\nto recommence with the same series of celestial phenomena. Some fixed\r\nthis universal renovation at the conjunction of all the planets, others\r\nat the return of the stars to the same point of the ecliptic; others,\r\nuniting these two kinds of revolutions, marked the term of the duration\r\nof all things at the moment at which the planets and the stars would\r\nreturn to the same primitive situation with regard to the ecliptic, or\r\nin other words, they conceived an immense period, which would include\r\none or more complete revolutions of each of the planets. All these\r\nperiods were called the ‘great year,’ or the ‘great revolution.’”\r\n_Histoire de l’Astronomie Ancienne._\r\n\r\n[2892] A.U.C. 657.\r\n\r\n[2893] A.U.C. 789.\r\n\r\n[2894] A public place in the Forum, where the comitia curiata were\r\nheld, and certain offences tried and punished.\r\n\r\n[2895] Cuvier remarks, that this passage is borrowed, with some\r\nchanges, from Aristotle’s “History of Animals,” B. ix. c. 32, but that\r\nthe account given by Pliny is not very easily explained, from the fact\r\nthat the word _eagle_ is not used by him in a rigorous acceptation\r\nof the word. Indeed it is only at the present day that any accurate\r\nknowledge has been obtained as to the different species of eagles,\r\nand the changes of colour to which they are subject with the advance\r\nof age; circumstances which have caused the species of them to be\r\nmultiplied by naturalists. It is very doubtful, he says, whether\r\nAristotle has distinguished the various kinds any better than Pliny;\r\nalthough Buffon, who himself was not very successful in distinguishing\r\nthem, says that Aristotle understood more on the subject than the\r\nmoderns.\r\n\r\n[2896] Μελανάετος, or the “black eagle.” Cuvier says, that this\r\ndescription is copied exactly from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 32.\r\nThis eagle, he says, cannot be, as is commonly supposed, the “common\r\neagle.” It can only be, he thinks, the “small” eagle, the female of\r\nwhich, according to Nauman and Savigny, when it is old is almost all\r\nblack, and without spots; only the young being spotted.\r\n\r\n[2897] From the Greek πυγὴ ἀργὴ, “white tail.” Cuvier remarks, that\r\nthis is copied exactly from Aristotle, except that he says nothing\r\nabout the whiteness of the tail, which is an interpolation. The\r\nfeathers as described agree with those of the common eagle, the Falco\r\nfulvus, which is strong enough to seize a fawn. As regards its habit,\r\nhe says, of dwelling on plains, that would agree better with the Jean\r\nle blanc of the French, the Falco Gallicus; while the name of pygargus\r\nis commonly applied, at the present day, to the great sea-eagle, the\r\nFalco albicilla; which frequents lakes and the sea-shore, and therefore\r\ncorresponds more nearly with the haliætus of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2898] Cuvier says, that he is almost tempted to believe that it is\r\nthe balbusard, the Falco haliætus, that is here meant, as it has a\r\nblack back, and lives in the vicinity of lakes. But then, he remarks,\r\nit lives on fish and not aquatic birds; while, on the other hand, the\r\nlittle eagle of Buffon, the Falco nævio, often seizes ducks and other\r\naquatic animals. He is inclined then, notwithstanding the apparent\r\nconfusion, to take this morphnos for the modern small eagle. The words\r\nμορφνὸς and περκνὸς signify “black.”\r\n\r\n[2899] From the Greek, meaning “black wing.”\r\n\r\n[2900] “Mountain stork.” Buffon thinks that this is the great brown\r\nvulture; Cuvier, the great white-headed eagle.\r\n\r\n[2901] Γνήσιος. “True-born,” “genuine.” Cuvier thinks that this may be\r\nthe royal or imperial eagle, Falco imperialis.\r\n\r\n[2902] The great sea-eagle, according to Cuvier, the varieties of\r\nwhich (in age) are called by Linnæus “Falco albicaudus,” and “Falco\r\nossifraga.”\r\n\r\n[2903] See Lucan, B. ix. l. 902.\r\n\r\n[2904] He contradicts himself, for he has already stated that it is the\r\nsixth species.\r\n\r\n[2905] “Barbata.” Cuvier takes it to be the læmmer-geyer, or Gypaëtus,\r\nthe only bird of prey that has a beard.\r\n\r\n[2906] Or eagle-stone. See B. xxxvi. c. 39. He does not there mention\r\nthat it is combustible. It is not impossible that pieces of aëtites, or\r\nferruginous geodes, may have been found in an eagle’s nest.\r\n\r\n[2907] Fora.\r\n\r\n[2908] Albertus Magnus says that he knows this by actual experience:\r\n“credat Judæus.”\r\n\r\n[2909] Ordinem.\r\n\r\n[2910] See Virgil, Æn. B. xi. l. 755, _et seq._ By the “dragon,” he\r\nmeans some large serpent.\r\n\r\n[2911] “Heroum.”\r\n\r\n[2912] The great European vulture.\r\n\r\n[2913] Their nests are seldom seen, in consequence of being concealed\r\nin the crags of the highest mountains, the Pyrenees, for instance.\r\n\r\n[2914] “Three” seems a better reading. Aristotle says “two.”\r\n\r\n[2915] Ovid, in his “Art of Love,” speaks of the use of eggs in\r\npurifications made by lovesick damsels. See B. ii. l. 330.\r\n\r\n[2916] This story arises from the extreme acuteness of their power of\r\nsmelling a dead body. The Egyptians said that the vulture foreknows the\r\nfield of battle seven days.\r\n\r\n[2917] Festus says, also, that it is the ossifrage, and was so called\r\nfrom the god Sancus.\r\n\r\n[2918] Aristotle says ten.\r\n\r\n[2919] A mere fable. Cuvier says that the ægithus of Aristotle was\r\nprobably a kind of sparrow.\r\n\r\n[2920] Said to be three in number; a mere fable. The buzzard probably\r\nis meant.\r\n\r\n[2921] The family of the Buteones belonged to the gens Fabia.\r\n\r\n[2922] Cuvier thinks that he means to identify this kind with the\r\ntriorchis, of which Aristotle says that it is to be seen at all seasons.\r\n\r\n[2923] See B. vi. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2924] Cuvier remarks, that we here find the art of falconry in its\r\nrough state. It was restored to Europe, no doubt, by the Crusaders. See\r\nBeckmann’s Hist. Inventions, vol. i. p. 201. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[2925] “Missas in sublime sibi excipere eos.” The meaning is very\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n[2926] The whole of this passage is, most probably, a gloss or\r\ninterpolation.\r\n\r\n[2927] This is denied by Albertus Magnus.\r\n\r\n[2928] Cuvier remarks, that Pliny has erroneously joined the account\r\ngiven by Aristotle of the cybindis, to that of the hybris, or ptynx. He\r\ntakes the cybindis to be the “Strix Uralensis” of Pallas.\r\n\r\n[2929] Cuvier says, that this notion is still entertained by the French\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\n[2930] This is not the case. It only lays in the nests of insectivorous\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n[2931] Cuvier remarks, that this is not a very good reason; but we have\r\nnot yet been able to find a better.\r\n\r\n[2932] Cuvier denies this story, but says, that when the foster-mother\r\nis a very small bird, the young cuckoo will take the whole of her head\r\nin his beak when receiving food.\r\n\r\n[2933] “Curse on your ill-betiding croak.” See “The Farmer’s Wife and\r\nthe Raven,” in Gay’s Fables.\r\n\r\n[2934] Aristotle says, that it was never to be seen in the Acropolis or\r\nCitadel of Athens.\r\n\r\n[2935] Only the case with the large raven, or Corvus corax of Linnæus,\r\nthe others living in flocks.\r\n\r\n[2936] Doé says, that this is incorrect; the beak of the raven not\r\nbeing of a similar form to that of the pigeon.\r\n\r\n[2937] Or else, “The Median guests.” It is not known to what he\r\nalludes. Alexander ab Alexandro says, that both Alexander the Great and\r\nCicero were warned of their deaths by the raven.\r\n\r\n[2938] “Noctua, bubo, ulula.” It is very doubtful what birds are\r\nmeant by these names. Cuvier has been at some pains to identify them,\r\nand concludes that the noctua, or glaux of Aristotle, is the Strix\r\nbrachyotas of Linnæus, the “short-eared screech-owl;” the bubo, the\r\nStrix bubo of Linnæus, and the ulula, the Strix aluco of Linnæus; our\r\nmadgehowlet, grey or brown owl.\r\n\r\n[2939] Seventh of March. The year of their consulship is not known.\r\n\r\n[2940] Cuvier suggests, that it may be the coracias of Aristotle, our\r\njackdaw probably, the Corvus graculus of Linnæus. It has been said,\r\nthat in its admiration of shining objects, it will take up a burning\r\ncoal; a trick which has before now caused conflagrations. Servius\r\nspeaks of it as frequenting funeral piles.\r\n\r\n[2941] A.U.C. 647.\r\n\r\n[2942] “Spinturnix” and “clivia” were names given by the augurs\r\nprobably to some kinds of birds.\r\n\r\n[2943] Cuvier ridicules the excessive ignorance of the augurs. It is\r\nwith the beak that the young bird breaks the shell.\r\n\r\n[2944] See B. xxv. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2945] Picus, the son of Saturn, king of Latium.

Cuvier says, that it is not the case\r\nthat they are bad eating, and remarks that birds have _no_ marrow in\r\nthe larger bones.\r\n\r\n[2973] Doé thinks that the spinal marrow is meant.\r\n\r\n[2974] B. iv. c. 18, and B. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2975] In B. vii. c. 2, Pliny speaks of the Pygmies as living to the\r\nfar East of India.\r\n\r\n[2976] See B. iv. cc. 20 and 26; and B. vi. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2977] The “village of the Python,” or “serpent.” Gueroult suggests\r\nthat this may he Serponouwtzi, beyond the river Oby, in Siberia.\r\n\r\n[2978] Thirteenth of August.\r\n\r\n[2979] M. Mauduit has a learned discussion in Panckouke’s Translation,\r\nvol. viii., many pages in length; in which he satisfactorily shows\r\nthat this is not entirely fabulous, but that the wild swan of the\r\nnorthern climates really is possessed of a tuneful note or cadence. Of\r\ncourse, the statement that it only sings just before its death, must be\r\nrejected as fabulous.\r\n\r\n[2980] The “mother of the quails.” Frederic II., in his work, De Arte\r\nVenandi, calls the “rallus,” or “rail,” the “leader of the quails.”\r\n\r\n[2981] From γλωττὰ, “a tongue.” It is not known what bird is alluded to.\r\n\r\n[2982] Bellon thinks that this is the _proyer_, or _prayer_, of the\r\nFrench; Aldrovandus considers it to be the ortolan.\r\n\r\n[2983] Gesner suggests from “asinus,” an “ass;” its feathers sticking\r\nup like the ears of that animal. Dalechamps thinks it is because its\r\nvoice resembles the braying of an ass; the name “otus” is from the\r\nGreek for “ear.”\r\n\r\n[2984] Either hemlock or hellebore.\r\n\r\n[2985] “Despui suetum.” See B. xxviii. c. 7. As Hardouin says, in\r\nmodern times they are considered delicate eating; but Schenkius,\r\nObsers. Med. B. i., states, that if the bird has eaten hellebore,\r\nepilepsy is the consequence to the person who partakes of its flesh.\r\n\r\n[2986] See B. iv. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[2987] A friend of Augustus, sent by him with proposals to Antony, B.C.\r\n41.\r\n\r\n[2988] The colour of the “factio,” or “party” of charioteers. See p.\r\n217.\r\n\r\n[2989] Galgulus.\r\n\r\n[2990] Cuvier suggests, that these birds may have been the Tringa\r\npugnax of Linnæus and Buffon, the males of which engage in most bloody\r\ncombats with each other on the banks of rivers, in spring.\r\n\r\n[2991] No doubt, as Cuvier says, this was the Numida meleagris of\r\nLinnæus, Guinea hen, or pintada. Cuvier remarks that they are very\r\npugnacious birds.\r\n\r\n[2992] See B. v. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[2993] Cuvier suggests, that these birds may have been of the starling\r\ngenus, perhaps the Tardus roseus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2994] The “hunter of flies.”\r\n\r\n[2995] Suetonius says, that when Tiberius was staying at Rhodes, an\r\neagle perched on the roof of his house; such a bird having never been\r\nseen before on the island.\r\n\r\n[2996] See B. iii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2997] It is still noted for its thieving propensities; witness the\r\nEnglish story of the Maid and the Magpie, and the Italian opera of “La\r\nGazza Ladra.” Cicero says, “They would no more trust gold with you,\r\nthan with a jackdaw.” See also Ovid’s Met. B. vii. It is the Corvus\r\npica of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2998] “Mottled pies.”\r\n\r\n[2999] See B. iv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[3000] Asia Minor, most probably. The assertion, though supported by\r\nTheophrastus, is open to doubt.\r\n\r\n[3001] See B. viii. c. 83.\r\n\r\n[3002] It was the nightingale that was said to be “Vox et præterea\r\nnihil;” “A voice, and nothing else.”\r\n\r\n[3003] As there may be different opinions on the meaning of the various\r\nparts of this passage, it is as well to transcribe it for the benefit\r\nof the reader, the more especially as, contrary to his usual practice,\r\nPliny is here in a particularly discursive mood. “Nunc continuo spiritu\r\ntrahitur in longum, nunc variatur inflexo, nunc distinguitur conciso,\r\ncopulatur intorto, promittitur revocato, infuscatur ex inopinato,\r\ninterdum et secum ipse murmurat, plenus, gravis, acutus, creber,\r\nextentus; ubi visum est, vibrans, summus, medius, imus.”\r\n\r\n[3004] 1227 francs, Ajasson says.\r\n\r\n[3005] Something very similar to this, we often see practised by the\r\nwater-warblers in our streets.\r\n\r\n[3006] Cuvier supposes that this is one of the fly-catchers; the\r\n“Muscicapa atricapilla” of Linnæus, which changes in appearance\r\nentirely after the breeding season.\r\n\r\n[3007] The “black-head.”\r\n\r\n[3008] Cuvier thinks that this is the wall nightingale, the Motacilla\r\nphœnicurus of Linnæus, which is not seen in winter. On the other hand,\r\nthe Motacilla rubecula of Linnæus, or red-throat, is only seen during\r\nthe winter, and being like the other bird, may have been taken for it,\r\nand named “phœnicurus.”\r\n\r\n[3009] This is not the case. Aristotle only says that it builds its\r\nnest of human ordure; a story probably without any foundation, but\r\nstill prevalent among the French peasantry.\r\n\r\n[3010] It has not been identified with precision. Pliny, B. xviii. c.\r\n69 calls it a small bird. Some make it the popinjay; others, with more\r\nprobability, the lapwing. Horace, B. iii. Ode 27, mentions it as the\r\nparra, a bird of ill omen.\r\n\r\n[3011] The Oriolus luteus, or witwall, according to Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3012] White blackbirds (if we may employ the paradox) are a distinct\r\nvariety, according to Cuvier, to be found in various countries, though\r\nbut rarely.\r\n\r\n[3013] This is from Herodotus, but it is incorrect. The black, or\r\nrather green ibis, Cuvier says, the Scolopax falcinellus of Linnæus, is\r\nfound not only near Pelusium, but all over the south of Europe.\r\n\r\n[3014] He alludes to the nightingale, mentioned in c. 43.\r\n\r\n[3015] The king-fisher, or Alcedo ispida of Linnæus. There is no truth\r\nwhatever in this favourite story of the ancients.\r\n\r\n[3016] In copying from Aristotle, he has put “collum,” by mistake, for\r\n“rostrum,” the “beak.”\r\n\r\n[3017] This bird in reality builds no nest, but lays its eggs in holes\r\non the water side. The objects taken for its nest are a zoophyte called\r\n_halcyonium_ by Linnæus, as Cuvier informs us, and similar in shape to\r\na nest.\r\n\r\n[3018] Or didapper.\r\n\r\n[3019] The first is the common chimney swallow. This latter one, Cuvier\r\nsays, is either the window swallow, the Hirundo urbica of Linnæus, or\r\nelse the martinet, the Hirundo apus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3020] The bank swallow, or Hirundo riparia of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3021] Cuvier thinks that this is either the _remiz_, the Parus\r\npendulinus of Linnæus, or else the moustache, the Parus biarmicus of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[3022] Not moss, Cuvier says, but blades of grass, and the silken\r\nfibres of the poplar and other aquatic trees.\r\n\r\n[3023] Cuvier thinks that it is the same bird as the vitiparra of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3024] Galgulus.\r\n\r\n[3025] This story, in all its extravagance, is related first by\r\nHerodotus, and then by Aristotle, who has reduced it to its present\r\ndimensions, as given by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3026] Cuvier suggests that, if at all based upon truth, this may have\r\nbeen the case in one instance, and then ascribed to the whole species.\r\n\r\n[3027] The Merops apiaster of Linnæus, or bee-eater.\r\n\r\n[3028] Cuvier says that the red partridge, the Tetrao rufus of Linnæus,\r\nis meant.\r\n\r\n[3029] The same wonderful story is told by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v.\r\nc. 5, and by Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xvii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[3030] “Metu.” Aristotle says, by sexual passion. The reading is\r\nprobably corrupt here.\r\n\r\n[3031] See B. xviii. c. 68; where he says that the summer solstice is\r\npast at the time of the incubation.\r\n\r\n[3032] Cuvier takes this to be the kestril, or Falco tinnunculus of\r\nLinnæus, and considers it to be synonymous with the cenchris, mentioned\r\nin c. 73, and in B. xxix. c. 6, though Pliny does not seem to be aware\r\nof the identity.\r\n\r\n[3033] Hirtius and Pansa. Frontinus, B. iii. c. 13. says that pigeons\r\nwere sent by Hirtius to Brutus. At the present day, letters are sent\r\nfastened under their wings.\r\n\r\n[3034] B. iii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[3035] “Without feet.” This was supposed to be the case with the\r\nmartinet, the Hirundo apus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3036] Or “goat-sucker.” The Caprimulgus Europæus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3037] Cuvier says that this is the spoon-bill, the Platalea leucorodea\r\nof Linnæus. Some suppose it to be the bittern.\r\n\r\n[3038] By nestling in the dust. Throwing dust over the body was one of\r\nthe ancient modes of purification.\r\n\r\n[3039] “Lustrant,” “perform a lustration.” This was done by the Romans\r\nwith a branch of laurel or olive, and sometimes bean-stalks were used.\r\n\r\n[3040] The linnet, probably.\r\n\r\n[3041] The “bull.” This cannot possibly be the bittern, as some have\r\nsuggested, for that is a large bird.\r\n\r\n[3042] Supposed to be the Motacilla flava of Linnæus, the spring\r\nwagtail.\r\n\r\n[3043] Hence the Latin name “psittacus.” From this, Cuvier thinks that\r\nthe first known among these birds to the Greeks and Romans, was the\r\ngreen perroquet with a ringed neck, the Psittacus Alexandri of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3044] Cuvier says that this is the jay, the Corvus glandarius of\r\nLinnæus; but that they are not more apt at speaking than the other\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n[3045] Cuvier remarks, that these can only be monstrosities.\r\n\r\n[3046] Britannicus, the son of Claudius, and Nero, his stepson.\r\n\r\n[3047] In the eighth region of the city.\r\n\r\n[3048] The nephew and son of Tiberius.\r\n\r\n[3049] Festus says that the “fane of Rediculus was without the Porta\r\nCapena; it was so called because Hannibal, when on the march from\r\nCapua, turned back (redierit) at that spot, being alarmed at certain\r\nportentous visions.”\r\n\r\n[3050] P. Cornelius Scipio Æmilianus Africanus Minor, the younger\r\nson of L. Æmilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia. It is doubtful\r\nwhether he died a natural death, or was privately assassinated by\r\nthe partisans of the Gracchi. His wife, Cornelia, and his mother,\r\nSempronia, were suspected by some persons.\r\n\r\n[3051] 28th March.\r\n\r\n[3052] One would hardly think that there was anything wonderful in a\r\ncrow being _very_ black.\r\n\r\n[3053] The “one-horned.”\r\n\r\n[3054] Most probably in Asia Minor, and not Eriza in India.\r\n\r\n[3055] Cuvier is inclined to think that the Anas tadorna approaches\r\nmost nearly the description given here. From Ovid’s description of\r\ntheir hard and pointed bills and claws, it would appear that a petrel\r\n(Procellaria), or else a white heron (Ardea garzetta), is intended;\r\nbut these birds, he remarks, do not make holes in the earth. Linnæus\r\nhas given the name of Diomedea exulans to the albatross, a bird of the\r\nAntarctic seas, which cannot have been known to the ancients.\r\n\r\n[3056] B. iii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[3057] See Ovid’s Met. B. xiii.\r\n\r\n[3058] Albertus Magnus says that swallows _can_ be tamed.\r\n\r\n[3059] The Fulica porphyrio of Linnæus, the Poule sultane of Buffon.\r\n\r\n[3060] Literally, “the blood-red foot.” Cuvier says that this\r\ndescription may apply to the sea-pie or oyster-eater, the Hæmatopus\r\nostralegus of Linnæus, or else the long-legged plover, the Charadrius\r\nhimantopus of Linnæus, but most probably the latter, more especially if\r\nthe reading here is “himantopus,” as some editions have it.\r\n\r\n[3061] “Muscæ,” “flies,” is a mistake of the copyists, Cuvier thinks,\r\nfor “musculi,” “mussels.”\r\n\r\n[3062] More especially the Larus parasiticus, Cuvier says.\r\n\r\n[3063] Dalechamps thinks that this story bears reference to the\r\nchatterer (the Ampelis garrulus of Linnæus), the ends of certain\r\nfeathers of the wings being extended, and of a vermilion colour:\r\nbut Cuvier looks upon Pliny’s account as almost nothing more than a\r\npoetical exaggeration.\r\n\r\n[3064] A species of duck, Cuvier thinks. from Aristophanes we learn\r\nthat they were common in the markets of Athens. Cuvier suggests that\r\nit may, have been the Anas galericulata of Linnæus, the Chinese teal,\r\nwhich the Parthians may have received from the countries lying to the\r\neast of them.\r\n\r\n[3065] “Phasiana,” so called from the river Phasis.\r\n\r\n[3066] A variety of the guinea fowl; probably the Numida Meleagris of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[3067] Literally, the “red-wing.” The modern flamingo.\r\n\r\n[3068] Buffon thinks that this is the grouse of the English, the Tetrao\r\nScoticus of the naturalists; but Cuvier is of opinion that it is either\r\nthe common wood-cock, the Tetrao bonasia of Linnæus, or else the\r\nwood-cock with pointed tail, of the south of Europe, the Tetrao alchata\r\nof Linnæus, most probably the latter, as the male has black and blue\r\nspots on the back; a fact which may explain the joke in the “Birds” of\r\nAristophanes, where a run-away slave who has been marked with stripes,\r\nis called an attagen. By some it is called the “red-headed hazel-hen.”\r\n\r\n[3069] In allusion, perhaps, to the words of Horace, Epod. ii. 54.\r\n\r\n        Non attagen Ionicus\r\n  Jucundior, quam lecta de pinguissimis\r\n        Oliva ramis arborum.\r\n\r\n[3070] Literally, the “bald crow.” Pliny, B. xi. c. 47, says that it\r\nis an aquatic bird: and naturalists generally identify it with the\r\ncormorant, the Pelecanus carbo of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3071] Literally, the red crow, the chocard of the Alps, the Corvus\r\npyrrhocorax of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3072] The “hare’s foot.” Identical with the snow partridge, the Tetrao\r\nlagopus of Linnæus; it is white in winter.\r\n\r\n[3073] The same bird, Cuvier says, as seen in summer, being then of a\r\nsaffron colour, with blackish spots.\r\n\r\n[3074] Cuvier remarks, that the green courlis, the Scolopax falcinellus\r\nof Linnæus, which is not improbably the real ibis of the ancients, is\r\nby no means uncommon in Italy.\r\n\r\n[3075] “Novæ aves.” The grey partridge, Hardouin thinks.\r\n\r\n[3076] Flamingo.\r\n\r\n[3077] See B. xi. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[3078] Scythia and Æthiopia ought to be transposed here, as the\r\ngriffons were said to be monsters that guarded the gold in the\r\nmountains of Scythia, the Uralian chain, probably.\r\n\r\n[3079] Literally, the “goat Pan.” Cuvier thinks that the bird here\r\nalluded to actually existed, and identifies it with the napaul, or\r\nhorned pheasant of Buffon, the penelope satyra of Gmell, a bird of the\r\nnorth of India, and which answers the description here given by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3080] See Ovid, Met. B. v. l. 553.\r\n\r\n[3081] A kind of crested lark.\r\n\r\n[3082] The Strix scops, probably, of Linn. See the Odyssey, B. v. l. 66.\r\n\r\n[3083] Those called Orchia, Didia, Oppia, Cornelia, Antia, and Julia\r\nnamely.\r\n\r\n[3084] Repositoria. See B. xxxiii. c. 49. See also B. ix. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[3085] Valerius Maximus, B. ix. c. 1, tells this story of the\r\nprofligate son of Æsopus.\r\n\r\n[3086] B. ix. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[3087] “Hominum linguas,” Pliny says; a singularly inappropriate\r\nexpression, it would appear.\r\n\r\n[3088] See B. viii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[3089] The tinnunculus, probably, of c. 52.\r\n\r\n[3090] B. ii. Sat. 4, l. 12. “Longa quibus facies ovis erit, ille\r\nmemento. Ut succi melioris, et ut magis alba rotundis.”\r\n\r\n[3091] Aristotle says just the reverse: but Hardouin thinks that the\r\npassage in Aristotle has been corrupted.\r\n\r\n[3092] This, Cuvier says, in reality is not the umbilical cord, but the\r\n_chalasis_, a little transparent and gelatinous ligament, by which the\r\nyolk is suspended like a globe. The true umbilical cord of the bird\r\nonly makes its appearance after an incubation of some days.\r\n\r\n[3093] Produced in the territory of Adria. See B. iii. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[3094] Cuvier says, that after an egg has been set upon for some days,\r\nthe heart of the chicken may be seen like a small red speck, that\r\npalpitates; but that no such thing is to be seen before incubation.\r\n\r\n[3095] Cuvier remarks, that the chicken is not formed exclusively from\r\nthe white, and that the yellow is gradually displaced by it, as the\r\nchicken increases in size.\r\n\r\n[3096] Cuvier tells us, that in the Memoirs of the Academy of St.\r\nPetersburgh, there is a memoir by Wolf, entitled _Ovum simplex\r\ngemelliferum_, in which these twin chickens are described with great\r\nexactness.\r\n\r\n[3097] More generally eleven or thirteen in this country.\r\n\r\n[3098] To secure their being more equably covered.\r\n\r\n[3099] Or rather, will produce chickens hideously deformed. This trick\r\nis sometimes practised among the country people against those to whom\r\nthey owe a grudge.\r\n\r\n[3100] Aristotle says with a straw mat.\r\n\r\n[3101] Similar, probably, to our bantam.\r\n\r\n[3102] In consequence, probably, of their smallness, and want of\r\nsufficient warmth.\r\n\r\n[3103] The pip.\r\n\r\n[3104] Meaning the “urine-egg.”\r\n\r\n[3105] Or “wind” eggs. See cc. 75 and 80.\r\n\r\n[3106] The white heron.\r\n\r\n[3107] So called from its soaring towards the stars.\r\n\r\n[3108] The tawny or black heron.\r\n\r\n[3109] Possibly the night-hawk. Sillig says, that in the corresponding\r\npassage of Aristotle it is αἰτώλιος.\r\n\r\n[3110] “Dog’s-urine.” See the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[3111] Hardouin asserts that this is the fact.\r\n\r\n[3112] This is probably fabulous.\r\n\r\n[3113] B. vii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[3114] Justly called by Juvenal, “meretricem Augustam,” Sat. vi. l. 118.\r\n\r\n[3115] B. viii. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[3116] Probably the goldfinch.\r\n\r\n[3117] A kind of large hound.\r\n\r\n[3118] The number that they bear.\r\n\r\n[3119] See B. viii. c. 81.\r\n\r\n[3120] B. viii. c. 10, and in the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[3121] B. vii. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[3122] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 37, does not quite say this. He\r\nsays that the young ones looked “as if” they were pregnant, οἷον κύοντα.\r\n\r\n[3123] Ovid, Met. B. xv. l. 389, makes mention of this belief.\r\n\r\n[3124] See the following Book.\r\n\r\n[3125] Known by us as the razor-sheath.\r\n\r\n[3126] Martial alludes to these fish-preserves, and the fish coming\r\nupon hearing their name, B. iv.

See B. viii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[3134] Pliny alludes to dogs, cats, and similar mammifera, as having\r\n_serrated_ teeth; the term, however, is quite inappropriate.\r\n\r\n[3135] See B. viii. c. 79.\r\n\r\n[3136] Probably the chlorion of c. 45.\r\n\r\n[3137] Supposed to be the golden-crested wren.\r\n\r\n[3138] An insect. See B. xi. c. 42, if, indeed, this is the same that\r\nis there mentioned, which is somewhat doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3139] It is not known what bird is meant: perhaps the titmouse.\r\n\r\n[3140] A kind of hawk or falcon.\r\n\r\n[3141] Species unknown.\r\n\r\n[3142] Probably the spring wag-tail.\r\n\r\n[3143] In B. viii. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[3144] Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 10, maintains the contrary. But\r\nin B. vii. he asserts that infants do dream.\r\n\r\n[3145] See Lucretius, B. iv. l. 914, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[3146] M. Manilius, mentioned in c. 2. Nothing certain is known of him,\r\nbut by some he is supposed to have been the senator and jurisconsult of\r\nthat name, contemporary with the younger Scipio.
