The London _Mining Journal_ of\r\nSeptember 9th, 1891, said of it: “We have seldom seen a book in which so\r\nmuch interesting matter combined with useful information is given in so\r\nsmall a space.”\r\n\r\nThe gold-mining industry has grown considerably since 1891, and it\r\nappeared to the writer that the present would be a propitious time to\r\nbring out a similar work, but with a considerably enlarged scope. What\r\nhas been aimed at is to make “Getting Gold” a compendium, in specially\r\nconcrete form, of useful information respecting the processes of winning\r\nfrom the soil and the after-treatment of gold and gold ores, including\r\nsome original practical discoveries by the author. Practical\r\ninformation, original and selected, is given to mining company\r\ndirectors, mine managers, quartz mill operators, and prospectors. In\r\n“Rules of Thumb,” chapters XI. and XII., will be found a large number\r\nof useful hints on subjects directly and indirectly connected with\r\ngold-mining.\r\n\r\nThe author’s mining experience extends back thirty years and he\r\ntherefore ventures to believe with some degree of confidence that the\r\ninformation, original or compiled, which the book contains, will be\r\nfound both useful and profitable to those who are in any capacity\r\ninterested in the gold-mining industry.\r\n\r\n                                            J.

The Third Edition has\r\nbeen revised throughout and several new figures in the text and eight\r\nfull-page plates have been added. It is confidently hoped that this new\r\nEdition will meet with the same kindly reception as the earlier ones.\r\n\r\n    _November_ 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    INTRODUCTORY.

It is desired by all nations, and is the one\r\nmetal the supply of which never exceeds the demand. Some one has aptly\r\nsaid, “Gold is the most potent substance on the surface of our planet.”\r\nTom Hood sings:\r\n\r\n    Gold, gold, gold, gold!\r\n    Bright and yellow, hard and cold;\r\n    Molten, graven, hammered, rolled,\r\n    Heavy to get, and light to hold;\r\n    Stolen, borrowed, squandered, doled.\r\n\r\nThat this much appreciated metal is heavy to get is proved by the high\r\nvalue which has been placed on it from times remote to date, and that it\r\nis light to hold most of us know to our cost.\r\n\r\nWe read no farther than the second chapter in the Bible when we find\r\nmention of gold. There Moses speaks of “the land of Havilah, where there\r\nis gold”; and in Genesis, chapter xxiv., we read that Abraham’s servant\r\ngave Rebekah an earring of half a shekel weight, say 4 dwt. 13 grs., and\r\n“two bracelets of ten shekels weight,” or about 4½ ozs. Then\r\nthroughout the Scriptures, and, indeed, in all historic writings, we\r\nfind frequent mention of the king of metals, and always it is spoken of\r\nas a commodity highly prized.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought, however, that either we are mistaken in the\r\nweights used by the Hebrew nation in early days, or that the arithmetic\r\nof those times was not quite “according to Cocker.” We read, I. Kings x.\r\nand xli., that Solomon in one year received no less than six hundred and\r\nthree score and six talents of gold. If a talent of gold was, as has\r\nbeen assumed, 3000 shekels of 219 grains each, the value of the golden\r\ntreasure accumulated in this one year by the Hebrew king would have been\r\n£3,646,350 sterling. Considering that the only means of “getting gold”\r\nin those days was a most primitive mode of washing it from river sands,\r\nor a still more difficult and laborious process of breaking the quartz\r\nfrom the lode without proper tools or explosives, and then slowly\r\ngrinding it by hand labour between two stones, the amount mentioned is\r\ntruly enormous.\r\n\r\nOf this treasure the Queen of Sheba, who came to visit the Hebrew\r\nmonarch, contributed a hundred and twenty talents, or, say, £600,000\r\nworth. Where the Land of Ophir, whence this golden lady came, was really\r\nsituated has evoked much controversy, but there is now a general opinion\r\nthat Ophir was on the east coast of Africa, somewhere near Delagoa Bay,\r\nin the neighbourhood of the Limpopo and Sabia rivers. It should be\r\nmentioned that the name of the “black but comely” queen was Sabia, which\r\nmay or may not be a coincidence, but it is certainly true that the\r\nrivers of this district have produced gold from prehistoric times till\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of remarkable ruins in the newly acquired province of\r\nMashonaland, which evince a high state of civilisation in the builders,\r\nmay throw some light on this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nThe principal value of gold is as a medium of exchange, and its high\r\nappreciation is due, first, to the fact that it is in almost universal\r\nrequest; and, secondly, to its comparative scarcity; yet, oddly enough,\r\nwith the exception of that humble but serviceable metal iron, gold is\r\nthe most widely distributed metal known. Few, if any, countries do not\r\npossess it, and in most parts of the world, civilised and uncivilised,\r\nit is mined for and brought to market. The torrid, temperate, and frigid\r\nzones are almost equally auriferous. Siberia, mid-Asia, most parts of\r\nEurope, down to equatorial and southern Africa in the Old World, and\r\nnorth, central, and southern America, with Australasia, in what may be\r\ntermed the New World, are all producers of gold in payable quantities.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier ages, the principal source of the precious metal was\r\nprobably Africa, which has always been prolific in gold. To this day\r\nthere are to be seen in the southern provinces of Egypt excavations and\r\nthe remains of old mine buildings and appliances left by the ancient\r\ngold-miners, who were mostly State prisoners. Some of these mines were\r\nworked by the Pharaohs of, and before, the time of Moses; and in these\r\ndreadful places thousands of Israelites were driven to death by the\r\ntaskmaster’s whip. Amongst the old appliances is one cut out of stone\r\nvery similar to the amalgamating, or blanket-table, of a modern quartz\r\nmill (_see_ p. 79).\r\n\r\nThe grinding was done between stones, and possibly by means of such\r\nprimitive mechanism as is used to-day by the natives of Korea.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 1. KOREAN MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe Korean Mill is simply a large hard stone shaped as in Fig. 1, to\r\nwhich a rocking motion is given by manual power by means of the bamboo\r\nhandles while the ore is crushed between the upper and basement stone.\r\n\r\nSolomon says “there is no new thing under the sun”; certainly there is\r\nmuch that is not absolutely new in appliances for gold extraction. I\r\nlately learned that the principle of one of our newest concentrating\r\nmachines, the Frue vanner, was known in India and the East centuries\r\nago; and we have it on good authority--that of Pliny--that gold saving\r\nby amalgamation with mercury was practised before the Christian era. It\r\nwill not be surprising then if, ere long, some one claims to have\r\ninvented the Korean Mill, with improvements.\r\n\r\nFew subjects in mineralogical science have evoked more controversy than\r\nthe origin of gold. In the Middle Ages, and, indeed, down to the time of\r\nthat great philosopher, Sir Isaac Newton, who was himself bitten with\r\nthe craze, it was widely believed that, by what was known as\r\ntransmutation, the baser metals might be changed to gold; and much time\r\nand trouble were expended in attempts to make gold--needless to say\r\nwithout the desired result. Doubtless, however, many valuable additions\r\nto chemical science, and also some useful metallic alloys, were thus\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe latest startling statement on this subject comes from, of course,\r\nthe wonderland of the world, America. In a recently published journal it\r\nis said that a scientific metallurgist there has succeeded in producing\r\nabsolutely pure gold, which stands all tests, from silver. Needless to\r\nsay, if this were true, at all events the much vexed bi-metallic\r\nquestion would be solved at once and for all time.\r\n\r\nIt is now admitted by all specialists that the royal metal, though\r\ndiffering in material respects in its mode of occurrence from its useful\r\nbut more plebeian brethren of the mineral kingdom, has yet been\r\ndeposited under similar conditions from mineral salts held in solution.\r\n\r\nThe first mode of obtaining this much desired metal was doubtless by\r\nwashing the sand of rivers which flowed through auriferous strata. Some\r\nof these, such as the Lydian stream, Pactolus, were supposed to renew\r\ntheir golden stores miraculously each year. What really happened was\r\nthat the winter floods detached portions of auriferous drift from the\r\nbanks, which, being disintegrated by the rush and flow of the water,\r\nwould naturally deposit in the still reaches and eddies any gold that\r\nmight be contained therein.\r\n\r\nThe mode of washing was exactly that carried on by the natives in some\r\ndistricts of Africa to-day. A wooden bowl was partly filled with\r\nauriferous sand and mud, and, standing knee-deep in the stream, the\r\noperator added a little water, and caused the contents of the bowl to\r\ntake a circular motion, somewhat as the modern digger does with his tin\r\ndish, with this difference, that his ancient prototype allowed the water\r\nand lighter particles to escape over the rim as he swirled the stuff\r\nround and round. I presume, in finishing the operation, he collected the\r\ngolden grains by gently lapping the water over the reduced material,\r\nmuch as we do now.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the mode in which auriferous lode-stuff was\r\ntreated in early times--_i.e._, by grinding between stones. This is also\r\npractised in Africa to-day, and we have seen that the Koreans, with\r\nMongolian acuteness, have gone a step farther, and pulverise the quartz\r\nby rocking one stone on another. In South America the arrastra is still\r\nused, which is simply the application of horse or mule power to the\r\nstone-grinding process, with use of mercury.\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of the gold supply of the modern world have been,\r\nfirst, South America, Transylvania in Europe, Siberia in Asia,\r\nCalifornia in North America, and Australia. Africa has always produced\r\ngold from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nThe later development in the Johannesburg district, Transvaal, which has\r\nabsorbed so many millions of English capital, is now, after much\r\ndifficulty and disappointment--thanks to British pluck and\r\nskill--producing splendidly. The yield for 1898 was 4,295,609, and for\r\n1903 2,859,477 ounces--a yield never before equalled by lode-mining from\r\none field.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1847 gold was discovered in California, at Sutor’s sawmill,\r\nSacramento Valley, where, on the water being cut off, yellow specks and\r\nsmall nuggets were found in the tail race. The enormous “rush” which\r\nfollowed is a matter of history and the subject of many romances, though\r\nthe truth has, in this instance, been stranger than fiction.\r\n\r\nThe yield of the precious metal in California since that date up to 1888\r\namounts to £256,000,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing close on the American discovery came that of Australia, the\r\ncredit of which has usually been accorded to Hargraves, a returned\r\nCalifornian digger, who washed out payable gold at Lewis Ponds Creek,\r\nnear Bathurst, in 1851. But there is now no reason to doubt that gold\r\nhad previously been discovered in several parts of that great island\r\ncontinent. It may be news to many that the first gold mine worked in\r\nAustralia was opened about twelve miles from Adelaide city, S.A., in the\r\nyear 1848. This mine was called the Victoria; several of the Company’s\r\nscrip are preserved in the Public Library; but some two years previous\r\nto this a man named Edward Proven had found gold in the same\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nMost Governments nowadays encourage in every possible way the discovery\r\nof gold-fields, and rewards ranging from hundreds to thousands of pounds\r\nare given to successful prospectors of new auriferous districts. The\r\nreward the New South Wales authorities meted out to a wretched convict,\r\nwho early in this century had dared to find gold, was a hundred lashes\r\nvigorously laid on to his already excoriated back. The man then very\r\nnaturally admitted that the alleged discovery was a fraud, and that the\r\nnugget produced was a melted down brass candlestick. One might have\r\nimagined that even in those unenlightened days it would not have been\r\ndifficult to find a scientist sufficiently well informed to put a little\r\nnitric acid on the supposed nugget, and so determine whether it was the\r\ngenuine article, without skinning a live man first to ascertain. My\r\nbelief is that the unfortunate fellow really found gold, but, as Mr.\r\nDeas Thompson, the then Colonial Secretary, afterwards told Hargraves in\r\ndiscouraging his reported discovery, “You must remember that as soon as\r\nAustralia becomes known as a gold-producing country it is utterly\r\nspoiled as a receptacle for convicts.”\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the secret of the unwillingness of the authorities to\r\nencourage the search for gold, and it is after all due to the fact that\r\nthe search was ultimately successful beyond all precedent, that\r\nAustralia has been for so many years relieved of the curse of\r\nconvictism, and has ceased once and for all to be a depôt for the\r\nscoundrelism of Britain--“Hurrah for the bright red gold!”\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1851 to 1897 the value of the gold raised in the\r\nAustralasian colonies realised the enormous amount of nearly\r\n£550,000,000. One cannot help wondering where it all goes.\r\n\r\nMulhall gives the existing money of the world at 2437 million pounds, of\r\nwhich 846 millions are paper, 801 millions silver, and 790 millions\r\ngold. From 1830 to 1880 the world consumed by melting down plate, &c.,\r\n4230 tons of silver more than it mined. From 1800 to 1870 the value of\r\ngold was about 15½ times that of silver. From 1870 to 1880 it was\r\n16·7 times the value of silver and now exceeds it over twenty times. In\r\n1700 the world had 301 million pounds of money, and in 1860, 1180\r\nmillion pounds sterling. In 1894 the current gold was worth about\r\n£800,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe gold first worked for in Australia, as in other places, was of\r\ncourse alluvial, by which is usually understood loose gold in nuggets,\r\nspecks, and dust, lying in drifts which were once the beds of long\r\nextinct streams and rivers, or possibly the moraines of glaciers, as in\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\nFurther on the differences will be mentioned between “alluvial” and\r\n“reef” or lode gold, for that there is a difference in origin in many\r\noccurrences, is, I think, provable. I hold, and hold strongly, that true\r\nalluvial gold is not always derived from the disintegration of lodes or\r\nreefs. For instance, the “Welcome Nugget” certainly never came from a\r\nreef. No such mass of gold, or anything approaching it, has ever yet\r\nbeen taken from a quartz matrix. It was found at Bakery Hill, Ballarat,\r\nin 1858, weight 2195 ozs., and sold for £10,500. This was above its\r\nactual value.\r\n\r\nThe “Welcome Stranger,” a still larger mass of gold, was found amongst\r\nthe roots of a tree at Dunolly, Victoria, in 1869, by two starved out\r\n“fossickers” named Deeson and Oates. The weight of this, the largest\r\nauthenticated nugget ever found, was 2268½ ozs., and it was sold for\r\n£10,000, but it was rendered useless as a specimen by the finders, who\r\nspent a night burning it to remove the adhering quartz.\r\n\r\nBut the ordinary digger neither hopes nor expects to unearth such\r\ntreasures as these. He is content to gather together by means of\r\npuddling machine, cradle, long tom, or even puddling tub and tin dish,\r\nthe scales, specks, dust, and occasional small nuggets ordinarily met\r\nwith in alluvial “washes.”\r\n\r\nHaving sunk to the “wash,” or “drift,” the digger, by means of one or\r\nmore of the appliances mentioned above, proceeds to separate the gold\r\nfrom the clay and gravel in which it is found. Of course in large\r\nalluvial claims, where capital is employed, such appliances are\r\nsuperseded by steam puddlers, buddles, and other machinery, and\r\nsometimes mercury is used to amalgamate the gold when very fine.\r\nHydraulicing is the cheapest form of alluvial mining, but can only be\r\nprofitably carried out where extensive drifts, which can be worked as\r\nquarry faces, and unlimited water exist in the same neighbourhood. When\r\nsuch conditions obtain a few grains of gold to the yard or ton will pay\r\nhandsomely.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 2. LODE FORMATION IN SLATE AND SANDSTONE.]\r\n\r\nLode, or reef mining, is a more expensive and complicated process,\r\nrequiring much skill and capital. First, let me explain what a lode\r\nreally is. The American term is “ledge,” and it is not inappropriate or\r\ninexpressive. Imagine then a ledge, or kerbstone, continuing to unknown\r\ndepths in the earth at any angle varying from perpendicular to nearly\r\nhorizontal. This kerbstone is totally distinct from the rocks which\r\nenclose it; those on one side may be slate, on the other, sandstone\r\n(Fig. 2); but the lode, separated usually by a small band of soft\r\nmaterial known to miners as “casing,” or “fluccan,” preserves always an\r\nindependent existence, and in many instances is practically bottomless\r\nso far as human exploration is concerned.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, reefs or lodes which are not persistent in depth.\r\nSometimes the lode formation is found only in the upper and newer\r\nstrata, and cuts out when, say, the basic rocks (such as granite, &c.)\r\nare reached. Again, there is a form of lode known among miners as a\r\n“gash” vein (Fig. 3). It is sometimes met with in the older crystalline\r\nslates, particularly when the lode runs conformably with the cleavage of\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 3. GASH VEIN.]\r\n\r\nMuch ignorance is displayed on the subject of lode formation and the\r\ndeposition of metals therein, even by mining men of long experience.\r\nMany still insist that lodes, particularly those containing gold, are of\r\nigneous origin, and point to the black and brown ferro-manganic outcrops\r\nin confirmation. It must be admitted that often the upper portions of a\r\nlode present a strong appearance of fire agency, but exactly the same\r\nappearance can be caused by oxidation of iron and manganese in water.\r\n\r\nIt may now be accepted as a proven fact that no true lode has been\r\nformed, or its metals deposited except by aqueous action. That is to\r\nsay, the bulk of the lode and all its metalliferous contents were once\r\nheld in solution in subterranean waters, which were ejected by geysers\r\nor simply filtered into fissures formed either by the shrinkage of the\r\nearth’s crust in process of cooling or by volcanic force.\r\n\r\nIt is not contended that the effect of the internal fires had no\r\ninfluence on the formation of metalliferous veins, indeed, it is certain\r\nthat they had, but the action was what is termed hydro-thermal (hot\r\nwater); and such action we may see in progress to-day in New Zealand,\r\nwhere hot springs stream or spout above the surface, when the silica and\r\nlime impregnated water, reduced in heat and released from pressure,\r\nbegins forthwith to deposit the minerals previously held in solution.\r\nHence the formation of the wondrous White and Pink Terraces, destroyed\r\nby volcanic action some sixteen years since, which grew almost while you\r\nwatched. So rapidly was the silica deposited that a dead beetle or\r\nti-tree twig left in the translucent blue water for a few days became\r\ncompletely coated and petrified.\r\n\r\nGold differs in its mode of occurrence from other metals in many\r\nrespects; but there is no doubt that it was once held in aqueous\r\nsolution and deposited in its metallic form by electro-chemical action.\r\nIt is true we do not find oxides, carbonates, or bromides of gold in\r\nNature, nor can we feel quite sure that gold now exists naturally as a\r\nsulphide, chloride, or silicate, though the presumption is strongly that\r\nit does. If so, the deposition of the gold may be ceaselessly\r\nprogressing.\r\n\r\nGenerally reef gold is finer as to size of the particles, and, as a\r\nrule, inferior in quality to alluvial. Thus, in addition to the extra\r\nlabour entailed in breaking into one of the hardest of rocks, quartz,\r\nthe _madre de oro_ (“mother of gold”) of the Spaniards, there is the\r\nadditional labour required to pulverise the rock so as to set free the\r\ntiniest particles of the noble metal it so jealously guards. There is\r\nalso the additional difficult operation of saving and gathering together\r\nthese small specks, and so producing the massive cakes and bars of gold\r\nin their marketable state.\r\n\r\nHaving found payable gold in quartz on the surface, the would-be miner\r\nhas next to ascertain two things. First, the strike or course of the\r\nlode; and secondly, its underlie, or dip. The strike, or course, is the\r\ndirection of the lode lengthwise.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the term “underlie” is used to designate the angle from the\r\nperpendicular at which the lode lies in its enclosing rocks, and by\r\n“dip” the angle at which it dips or inclines lengthwise on its course.\r\nThus, at one point the cap of a lode may appear on the surface, and some\r\ndistance further the cap may be hundreds of feet below. Usually a shaft\r\nis sunk in the “reef” to prove the underlie, and a level, or levels,\r\ndriven on the course to ascertain its direction underground, also if the\r\ngold extends, and if so, how far. This being proved, next a vertical\r\nshaft is sunk on the hanging or upper wall side, and the reef is either\r\ntapped thereby, or a cross-cut driven to intersect it.\r\n\r\nWe will now assume that our miners have found their lode payable, and\r\nhave some hundreds of tons of good gold-bearing stone in sight or at the\r\nsurface. They must next provide a reducing plant.\r\n\r\nOf means for crushing or triturating quartz there is no lack, and every\r\nyear gives us fresh inventions for the purpose, each one better than\r\nthat which preceded it, according to its inventor. Most practical men,\r\nhowever, prefer to continue the use of the stamper battery, which is\r\nvirtually a pestle and mortar on a large scale. Why we adhere to this\r\nform of pulverising machine is that, though somewhat wasteful of power,\r\nit is easily understood, its wearing parts are cheaply and expeditiously\r\nreplaced, and it is so strong that even the most perversely stupid\r\nworkman cannot easily break it or put it out of order.\r\n\r\nThe stone, being pounded into sand of such degree of fineness as the\r\ngold requires, passes through a perforated iron plate called a\r\n“grating,” or “screen,” on to an inclined surface of copper plates faced\r\nwith mercury, having small troughs, or “riffles,” containing mercury,\r\nplaced at certain distances apart.\r\n\r\nThe crushed quartz is carried over these copper “tables,” as they are\r\ntermed, thence over the blanket tables--that is, inclined planes covered\r\nwith coarse serge, blankets, or other flocculent material--so that the\r\nheavy particles may be caught in the hairs, or is passed over vanners or\r\nconcentrating machines. The resulting “concentrates,” consisting for\r\nthe most part of sulphides of iron, copper, and lead, are washed off\r\nfrom time to time and reserved for secondary treatment.\r\n\r\nFirst, they are roasted to get rid of the sulphur, arsenic, &c, which\r\nwould interfere with the amalgamation or lixiviation, and then either\r\nground to impalpable fineness in one of the many triturating pans with\r\nmercury, or treated by chlorine or cyanogen.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we are merely amalgamating, then at stated periods the\r\nbattery and pans are cleared out, the amalgam rubbed or scraped from the\r\ncopper plates and raised from the troughs and riffles. It is then\r\nsqueezed through chamois leather, or good calico will do as well, and\r\nretorted in a large iron retort, the nozzle of which is kept in water so\r\nas to convert the mercurial vapour again to the metallic form. The\r\nresult is a spongy cake of gold, which is either sold as “retorted” gold\r\nor smelted into bars.\r\n\r\nThe other and more scientific methods of extracting the precious metal\r\nfrom its matrices, such as lixiviation or leaching, by means of solvents\r\n(chlorine, cyanogen, hyposulphite of soda, &c), will be more fully\r\ndescribed further on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    GOLD PROSPECTING--ALLUVIAL AND GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is purposed in this chapter to deal specially with the operation of\r\nsearching for valuable mineral by individuals or small working parties.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that much disappointment and loss accrue through lack\r\nof knowledge by prospectors, who with all their enterprise and energy\r\nare often very ignorant, not only of the probable locality, mode of\r\noccurrence, and widely differing appearance of the various valuable\r\nminerals, but also of the best means of locating and testing the ores\r\nwhen found. It is for the information of such as these that this chapter\r\nis mainly intended, not for scientists or miners of large experience.\r\n\r\nAll of us who have had much to do with mining know that the majority of\r\nthe best mineral finds have been made by the purest accident; often by\r\nmen who had no mining knowledge whatever; and that many valuable\r\ndiscoveries have been delayed, or, when made, abandoned as not payable,\r\nfrom the same cause--ignorance of the rudiments of mineralogy and\r\nmining. I have frequently been asked by prospectors, when inspecting new\r\nmineral fields, what rudimentary knowledge will be most useful to them\r\nand how it can be best obtained.\r\n\r\nIf a man can spare the time a course of lessons at some accredited\r\nschool of mines will be, undoubtedly, the best possible training; but if\r\nhe asks what books he should read in order to obtain some primary\r\ntechnical instruction, I reply: First, an introductory text-book of\r\ngeology, which will tell him in the simplest and plainest language all\r\nhe absolutely requires to know on this important subject. Every\r\nprospector should understand elementary geology so far as general\r\nknowledge of the history of the structure of the earth’s crust and of\r\nthe several actions that have taken place in the past, or are now in\r\noperation, modifying its conditions. He may with advantage go a few\r\nsteps further and learn to classify the various formations into systems,\r\ngroups, and series: but he can acquire all that he need absolutely know\r\nfrom this useful little 2_s._ 6_d._ book. Next, it is advisable to learn\r\nsomething about the occurrence and appearance of the valuable minerals\r\nand the formations in which they are found. For all practical purposes I\r\ncan recommend Cox and Ratte’s “Mines and Minerals,” one of the Technical\r\nEducation series of New South Wales, which deals largely with the\r\nsubject from an Australian standpoint, and is therefore particularly\r\nvaluable to the Australian miner, but which will be found applicable to\r\nmost other gold-bearing countries. I must not, however, omit to mention\r\nan admirably compiled _multum in parvo_ volume prepared by Mr. G.\r\nGoyder, jun., Government Assayer and Assay Instructor at the School of\r\nMines, Adelaide. It is called the “Prospectors’ Pocketbook,” costs only\r\none shilling, is well bound, and of handy size to carry. In brief, plain\r\nlanguage it describes how a man, having learned a little of assaying,\r\nmay cheaply provide himself with a portable assay plant, and fluxes, and\r\nalso gives considerable general information on the subject of minerals,\r\ntheir occurrence and treatment.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Another excellent and really practical book is Prof. Cole’s\r\n        “Practical Aids in Geology” (second edition), 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nIt may here be stated that twenty-one years ago the author did a large\r\namount of practical silver assaying on the Barrier Hill, which was not\r\nthen so accessible a place as it is now, and got closely correct results\r\nfrom a number of different mines, with an extemporised plant almost\r\namusing in its simplicity. All I took from Adelaide were a small set of\r\nscales capable of determining the weight of a button down to 20 ozs. to\r\nthe ton, a piece of cheese cloth to make a screen or sieve, a tin ring\r\n1½ in. diameter, by 1/2 in. high, a small brass door knob to use as a\r\ncupel mould, and some powdered borax, carbonate of soda, and argol for\r\nfluxes; while for reducing lead I had recourse to the lining of a\r\ntea-chest, which lead contains no silver--John Chinaman takes good care\r\nof that. My mortar was a jam tin, without top or bottom, placed on an\r\nanvil; the pestle a short steel drill. The blacksmith at Mundi Mundi\r\nStation made me a small wrought iron crucible, also a pair of bent tongs\r\nfrom a piece of fencing-wire. The manager gave me a small common red\r\nflower pot for a muffle, and with the smith’s forge (the fire built\r\nround with a few blocks of talcose schist) for a furnace, my plant was\r\ncomplete. I burned and crushed bones to make my bone-dust for cupelling,\r\nand thus provided made nearly forty assays, some of which were\r\nafterwards checked in Adelaide, in each instance coming as close as\r\ncheck assays generally do. Nowadays one can purchase cheaply a very\r\neffective portable plant, or after a few lessons a man may by practice\r\nmake himself so proficient with the blowpipe as to obtain assay results\r\nsufficiently accurate for most practical purposes.\r\n\r\nComing then to the actual work of prospecting. What the prospector\r\nrequires to know is, first, the usual locality of occurrence of the more\r\nvaluable minerals; secondly, their appearance; thirdly, a simple mode of\r\ntesting. With respect to occurrence, the older sandy and clay slates,\r\nchlorite slates, micaceous, and hornblendic schists, particularly at or\r\nnear their junction with the intrusive granite and diorite, generally\r\nform the most likely geological country for payable mineral lodes,\r\nparticularly gold, silver and tin. But those who have been engaged in\r\npractical mining for long, finding by experience that no two mineral\r\nfields are exactly alike in all their characteristics, have come to the\r\nconclusion that it is unwise to form theories as to why metals should or\r\nshould not be found in certain enclosing rocks or matrices. Some of the\r\nbest reef gold got in Victoria has been obtained in dead white,\r\nmilky-looking quartz almost destitute of base metal. In South Australia\r\nreef gold is almost invariably associated with iron, either an oxide, as\r\n“gossan;” or ferruginous calcite, “limonite;” or granular silica,\r\nconglomerated by iron, the “ironstone” which forms the capping or\r\noutcrop of many of our reefs, and which is often rich in gold.\r\n\r\nBut to show that it is unsafe to decide off-hand in what class of\r\nmatrix metals will or will not be found, I may say that in my own\r\nexperience I have seen payable gold in the following materials:--\r\n\r\nQuartz, dense and milky, also in quartz of nearly every colour and\r\nappearance, saccharoidal, crystalline, nay, even in clear glass-like\r\nsix-sided prismatic crystals, and associated with silver, copper, lead,\r\narsenic, iron as sulphide, oxide, carbonate, and tungstate, antimony,\r\nbismuth, nickel, zinc, lead, and other metals in one form or another; in\r\nslate, quartzite, mica schist, granite, diorite, porphyry, felsite,\r\ncalcite, dolomite, common carbonate of iron, siliceous sinter from a hot\r\nspring, as at Mount Morgan; as alluvial gold in drifts formed of almost\r\nall these materials; and once, perhaps the most curious matrix of all, a\r\nsmall piece of apparently alluvial gold, naturally imbedded in a shaly\r\npiece of coal. This specimen, I think, is in the Sydney Museum. One\r\nthing, however, the prospector may make sure of: he will always find\r\ngold more or less intimately associated with silica (quartz) in one or\r\nother of its many forms, just as he will always find cassiterite (oxide\r\nof tin) in the neighbourhood of granite containing muscovite (white\r\nmica), which so many people will persist in terming talc. It is stated\r\nto be a fact that tin has never been found more than about two miles\r\nfrom such granite.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of its widely divergent occurrence, it will be\r\nadmitted that the Cornish miners’ saying with regard to metals generally\r\napplies with great force to gold: “Where it is, there it is”: and\r\n“Cousin Jack” adds, with pathetic emphasis, “and where it is generally,\r\nthere I ain’t.”\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the geological “country rock” in which reef\r\ngold is most likely to be discovered--_i.e._, the junction of the slates\r\nand schists with the igneous or metamorphic (altered) rocks, or in this\r\nvicinity. Old river beds formed of gravelly drifts in the same\r\nneighbourhood may probably contain alluvial gold, or shallow deposit of\r\n“wash,” or hillsides and valleys will often carry good surface gold.\r\nThis is sometimes due to the denudation, or wearing away, of the hills\r\ncontaining quartz veins--that is, where the alluvial gold really was\r\nderived from such veins, which, popular opinion to the contrary, is not\r\nalways the case.\r\n\r\nMuch disappointment and loss of time and money would often be prevented\r\nif prospectors would realise that _all_ alluvial gold does not come from\r\nthe quartz veins or reefs; and that following up an alluvial lead, no\r\nmatter how rich, will not inevitably develop a payable gold lode.\r\nSometimes gold, evidently of reef origin, is found in the alluvial; but\r\nin that case it is generally fine as regards the size of the particles,\r\nmore or less sharp-edged, or crystalline in form if recently shed; while\r\nsuch gold is often of poorer quality than the true alluvial which occurs\r\nin mammillary (breast-like) nuggets, and is of a higher degree of purity\r\nas gold.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary non-scientific digger will do well to give credence to this\r\nview of the case, and will often thereby save himself much useless\r\ntrouble. Sometimes also the alluvial gold, coarser in size than true\r\nreef-born alluvial, is derived almost _in situ_ from small quartz\r\n“leaders,” or veins, which the grinding down of the face of the slates\r\nhas exposed; these leaders in time being also broken and worn, set free\r\nthe gold they have contained, which does not, as a rule, travel far, but\r\nsometimes becomes waterworn by the rubbing over it of the disintegrated\r\nfragments of rock.\r\n\r\nBut the heavy, true alluvial gold, in great pure masses, mammillary, or\r\nbotryoidal (like a bunch of grapes) in shape, have assuredly been formed\r\nby accretion on some metallic base, from gold salts in solution,\r\nprobably chloride, possibly sulphide or silicate.\r\n\r\nNuggets, properly so-called, are never found in quartz lodes; but, as\r\nwill be shown later, a true nugget having all the characteristics of\r\nso-called waterworn alluvial may be artificially formed on a small\r\npiece of galena, or pyrites, by suspending the base metal in the loop of\r\na thread in a weak solution of chloride of gold in which a few hard-wood\r\nchips are thrown.\r\n\r\nProspecting for alluvial gold at shallow depths is a comparatively easy\r\nprocess, requiring no great amount of technical knowledge. Usually the\r\nfirst gold is got at or near the surface and then traced to deep leads,\r\nif such exist.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Brown Gold-field, N.S.W., in 1881, I saw claimholders turning\r\nout to work equipped only with a small broom made of twigs and a tin\r\ndish. With the broom they carefully swept out the crevices of the\r\ndecomposed slate as it was exposed on the surface, and putting the\r\nresulting dust and fragments into the tin dish proceeded to dry blow it.\r\n\r\nIn “dry blowing” the operator takes the dish about half full of dirt,\r\nand standing with his back or side to the wind, if there be any, begins\r\nthrowing the stuff up and catching it, or sometimes slowly pouring it\r\nfrom one dish to another, the wind in either case carrying away the\r\nfiner particles. He then proceeds to reduce the quantity by carefully\r\nextracting the larger fragments of rock, till eventually he has only a\r\nhandful or so of moderately fine “dirt” which contains any gold there\r\nmay be. If in good sized nuggets it is picked out, if in smaller pieces\r\nor fine grains the digger slowly blows the sand and dust aside with his\r\nbreath, leaving the gold exposed. This process is both tedious and\r\nunhealthy, and of course can only be carried out with very dry surface\r\ndirt. The material in which the gold occurred at Mount Brown was\r\ncomposed of broken slate and alluvium with a few angular fragments of\r\nquartz. Yet, strange to say, the gold always had a waterworn appearance,\r\nprobably due to erosion by drifting sand as is so often the case in\r\nWestralian so-called alluvial.\r\n\r\nDry blowing is now much in vogue on the West Australian fields owing to\r\nthe scarcity of water; but the great objection is first, the large\r\namount of dust the unfortunate dry blower has to carry about his person,\r\nand secondly, that the peck of dirt which is supposed to last most men a\r\nlifetime has to be made a continuous meal of every day.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 4. PUDDLING TUB.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE I.--TUB PUDDLING _To face p._ 18]\r\n\r\nFor wet alluvial prospecting the appliances, besides pick and shovel,\r\nare puddling tub (Fig. 4 and Pl. I.), tin dish, and cradle (Fig. 5 and\r\nPl. II.); the latter, a man handy with tools can easily make for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 5. SECTIONAL SKETCH OF CRADLE.]\r\n\r\nIn sinking, the digger should be careful (1) to avoid making his shaft\r\ninconveniently small, and (2) not to waste his energy by sinking a huge\r\n“new chum” hole, which usually starts by being about three times too\r\nlarge for the requirements at the surface, but narrows in like a funnel\r\nat 10 feet or less. A shaft, say 4 feet by 2 feet 6 inches and sunk\r\nplumb, the ends being half rounded, is large enough for all requirements\r\nto a considerable depth, though I have seen smart men, when they were in\r\na hurry to reach the drift, get down in a shaft even less in size.\r\n\r\nThe novice who is trying to follow or to find a deep lead must fully\r\nunderstand that the present bed of the surface river may not, in fact\r\nseldom does, indicate the ancient watercourses long since buried either\r\nby volcanic or diluvial action, which contain the rich auriferous\r\ndeposits for which he is seeking; and much judgment and considerable\r\nunderground exploration are often required to decide on the true course\r\nof leads. Only by a careful consideration of all the geological\r\nsurroundings can an approximate idea be obtained from surface inspection\r\nalone; and the whole probable conditions which led to the present\r\ncontour of the country must be carefully taken into account.\r\n\r\nHow am I to know true bottom when I see it? asks the inexperienced\r\ndigger. Well, nothing but long experience and intelligent observation\r\nwill prevent mistakes at times, particularly in deep ground; but as a\r\ngeneral rule, though it may sound paradoxical, you may know the bottom\r\nby the top.\r\n\r\nThat is, we will assume you are sinking in, say, 10 to 12 feet ground in\r\na gully on the bank of which the country rock is exposed, and is, say,\r\nfor instance, a clay slate or sandy slate set at a certain angle; then,\r\nin all probability--unless there be a distinct fault or change in the\r\ncountry rock between the slate outcrop and your shaft--the bottom will\r\nbe a similar slate, standing at the same angle; and this will very\r\nprobably be overlaid by a deposit of pipeclay, formed by the\r\ndecomposition of the slates.\r\n\r\nFrom the crevices of these slates, sometimes penetrating to a\r\nconsiderable distance, you may get gold, but it is a useless attempt to\r\nsink through them. If the outcropping strata be a soft calcareous\r\n(limey) sandstone or soft felspathic rock, and that be also the true\r\n“bottom,” great care should be exercised, or one is apt to sink through\r\nthe bed rock, which may be very loose and decomposed. I have known\r\nmistakes made in this way when many feet have been sunk, and driven\r\nthrough what was actually bed rock, though so soft as to deceive even\r\nmen of experience. The formation, however, must be the guide, and except\r\nin some specially difficult cases, a man can soon tell when he is really\r\non bed rock or “bottom.”\r\n\r\nOn an alluvial lead the object of every one is to “get on the gutter,”\r\nthat is, to reach the lowest part of the old underground watercourse,\r\nthrough which for centuries the gold may have been accretionising from\r\nthe percolation of the mineral-impregnated water; or, when derived from\r\nreefs or broken down leaders, the flow of water has acted as a natural\r\nsluice wherein the gold is therefore most thickly collected. Sometimes\r\nthe lead runs for miles and is of considerable width, at others it is\r\nirregular, and the gold-bearing “gutter” small and hard to find. In many\r\ninstances, for reasons not readily apparent, the best gold is not found\r\nexactly at the lowest portion of these narrow gutters, but a little way\r\nup the sides. This fact should be taken into consideration in\r\nprospecting new ground, for many times a claim has been deserted after\r\ncleaning up the “bottom,” and another man has got far better gold\r\nconsiderably higher up on the sides of the gutter. For shallow alluvial\r\ndeposits, where a man quickly works out his 30 by 30 feet claim, it may\r\nbe cheaper at times to “paddock” the whole ground--that is, take all\r\naway from surface to bottom, but if he is in wet ground and he has to\r\ndrive, great care should be taken to properly secure the roof by means\r\nof timber. How this may best be done the local circumstances only can\r\ndecide. In loose or treacherous ground careful attention should be given\r\nto timbering, _i.e._, securing the ground to prevent caving in.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE II.--CRADLING]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    LODE OR REEF PROSPECTING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter dealt more especially with prospecting as\r\nconducted on alluvial fields. I shall now treat of preliminary mining on\r\nlodes or “reefs.”\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the likeliest localities for the occurrence\r\nof metalliferous deposits are at or near the junction of the older\r\nsedimentary formations with the igneous or intrusive rocks, such as\r\ngranites, diorites, &c. In searching for payable lodes, whether of gold,\r\nsilver, copper, or even tin in some forms of occurrence, the indications\r\nare often very similar. The first prospecting is usually done on the\r\nhilltops or ridges, because, owing to denudation by ice or water which\r\nhave bared the bedrock, the outcrops are there more exposed, and thence\r\nthe lodes are followed down through the alluvial covered plains, partly\r\nby their “strike” or “trend,” and sometimes by other indicating\r\nevidences, which the practical miner has learned to know.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a lesson in tracing the lode in a grass covered country\r\nwas taught me many years ago by an old prospector who had struck good\r\ngold in the reef at a point some distance to the east of what had been\r\nconsidered the true course. I asked him why he had opened the ground at\r\nthat particular place. Said he, “Some folks don’t use their eyes. You\r\nstand here and look towards that claim on the rise where the reef was\r\nlast struck. Now, don’t you see there is almost a track betwixt here and\r\nthere where the grass and herbage is more withered than on either side?\r\nWhy? Well, because the hard quartz lode is close to the surface all the\r\nway, and there is no great depth of soil to hold the moisture and make\r\nthe grass grow.”\r\n\r\nI have found this simple lesson in practical prospecting of use since.\r\nBut the strike or course of a quartz reef is more often indicated by\r\noutcrops, either of the silica itself or ironstone “blows,” as the\r\nminers call them, but the term is a misnomer, as it argues the easily\r\ndisproved igneous theory of veins of ejection, meaning thereby that the\r\nquartz with its metalliferous contents was thrown out in a molten state\r\nfrom the interior of the earth. This has in no case occurred, and the\r\ntheory is an impossible one. True lodes are veins of injection formed by\r\nthe infiltration of silicated waters carrying the metals also in\r\nsolution. This water filled the fissures caused either by the cooling of\r\nthe earth’s crust, or formed by sudden upheavals of the igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nSometimes in alluvial ground the trend of the reef will be revealed by a\r\ntrack of quartz fragments, more or less thickly distributed on the\r\nsurface and through the superincumbent soil. Follow these, and at some\r\npoint, if the lode be continuous, a portion of its solid mass will\r\ngenerally be found to protrude and can then again be prospected.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule as to the trend or strike of lodes, except that a\r\ngreater number are found taking a northerly and southerly course than\r\none which is easterly and westerly. At all events, such is the case in\r\nAustralia, but it cannot be said that either has the advantage in being\r\nmore productive. Some of the richest mines in Australasia have been in\r\nlodes running easterly and westerly, while gold, tin, and copper, in\r\ngreat quantity and of high percentage to the ton, have been got in such\r\nmines as Mount Morgan, Mount Bischoff, and the Burra, which contain no\r\nlodes properly so-called.\r\n\r\nMount Morgan is the richest and most productive gold mine in Australasia\r\nand amongst the best in the world.\r\n\r\nIts yield for 1895 was 128,699 oz. of gold, valued at £528,700.\r\nDividends paid in 1895, £300,000.\r\n\r\nThis mine was opened in 1886. Up to May 31, 1897, the total yield was\r\n1,631,981 ozs. of gold, sold at £6,712,187, from which £4,400,000 have\r\nbeen paid in dividends. (See _Mining Journal_, for Oct. 9, 1897).\r\n\r\nMount Morgan shareholders have, in other words, divided over 43½ tons\r\nof standard gold.\r\n\r\nThe Burra Burra copper mine, about 100 miles from Adelaide, in a\r\ndirection a little to the east of north, was found in 1845 by a shepherd\r\nnamed Pickett. It is singularly situated on bald hills standing 130 ft.\r\nabove the surrounding country. The ores obtained from this mine have\r\nbeen chiefly red oxides, very rich blue and green carbonates, including\r\nmalachite, and also native copper. The discovery of this mine,\r\nsupporting, as it did at one time a large population, marked a new era\r\nin the history of the colony. The capital invested in it was £12,320 in\r\n£5 shares, and no subsequent call was ever made upon the shareholders.\r\nThe total amount paid in dividends was £800,000. After being worked by\r\nthe original owners for some years the mine was sold to a new company,\r\nbut during the last few years it has not been worked, owing in some\r\ndegree to the low price of copper and also to the fact that the deposit\r\noriginally operated upon apparently became exhausted. For many years the\r\naverage yield was from 10,000 to 13,000 tons of ore, averaging 22 to 23\r\nper cent. of copper. It is stated that, during the twenty-nine and a\r\nhalf years in which the mine was worked, the company expended £2,241,167\r\nin general expenses. The output of ore during the same period amounted\r\nto 234,648 tons, equal to 51,622 tons of copper. This, at the average\r\nprice of copper, amounted to a money value of £4,749,224. The mine\r\nstopped working in 1877.\r\n\r\nMount Bischoff, Tasmania, has produced, since the formation of the\r\nCompany to December 1895, 47,263 tons of tin ore. It is still in full\r\nwork and likely to be for years to come.\r\n\r\nEach of these immense metalliferous deposits was found outcropping on\r\nthe summit of a hill of comparatively low altitude. There are no true\r\nwalls nor can the ore be traced away from the hill in lode form. These\r\noccurrences are generally held to be due to hydro-thermal or geyser\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThen again lodes are often very erratic in their course. Slides and\r\nfaults throw them far from their true line, and sometimes the lode is\r\nrepresented by a number of lenticular (double-pointed in section)\r\nmasses of quartz of greater or less length, either continuing point to\r\npoint or overlapping, “splicing,” as the miners call it (Fig. 6). Such\r\nformations are very common in West Australia. All this has to be\r\nconsidered and taken into account when tracing the run of stone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 6. LENTICULAR VEIN.]\r\n\r\nThe tyro also must carefully remember that in rough country where the\r\nlode strikes across hills and valleys, the line of the cap or outcrop\r\nwill apparently be very sinuous owing to the rises and depressions of\r\nthe surface. Many people even now do not understand that true lodes or\r\nreefs are portions of rock or material differing from the surrounding\r\nand enclosing strata, and continuing down to unknown depths at varying\r\nangles. Therefore, if you have a north and south lode outcropping on a\r\nhill and crossing an east and west valley, the said lode, underlying\r\neast, when you have traced its outcrop to the lowest point in the\r\nvalley, between the two hills, will be found to be a greater or less\r\ndistance, according to the angle of its dip or underlie, to the east of\r\nthe outcrop on the hill where it was first seen. If it be followed up\r\nthe next hill it will come again to the west, the amount of apparent\r\ndeviation being regulated by the height of the hills and depth of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nA simple demonstration will make this plain. Take a piece of half-inch\r\npine board, 2 ft. long and 9 in. wide, and imagine this to be a lode;\r\nnow cut a half circle out of it from the upper edge with a fret saw and\r\nlean the board say at an angle of 45° to the left, look along the top\r\nedge, which you are to consider as the outcrop on the high ground, the\r\nbottom of the cut being the outcrop in the valley, and it will be seen\r\nthat the lowest portion of the cut is some inches to the right; so it is\r\nwith the lode, and in rough country very nice judgment is required to\r\ntrace the true course.\r\n\r\nFor indications, never pass an ironstone “blow” without examination.\r\nRemember the pregnant Cornish saying with regard to mining and the\r\ncurrent aphorism, “The iron hat covers the golden head.” “Cousin Jack,”\r\nput it “Iron rides a good horse.” The ironstone outcrop may cover a\r\ngold, silver, copper, or tin lode.\r\n\r\nIf you are searching for gold, the presence of the royal metal should be\r\napparent on trial with the pestle and mortar; if silver, either by sight\r\nin one of its various forms or by assay, blowpipe or otherwise; copper\r\nwill reveal itself by its peculiar colour, green or blue carbonates, red\r\noxides, or metallic copper. It is an easy metal to prospect for, and its\r\npercentage is not difficult to determine approximately. Tin is more\r\ndifficult to identify, as it varies so greatly in appearance.\r\n\r\nHaving found your lode and ascertained its course, you want next to\r\nascertain its value. As a rule (and one which it will be well to\r\nremember) if you cannot find payable metal, particularly in gold “reef”\r\nprospecting, at or near the surface, it is not worth while to sink,\r\nunless, of course, you design to strike a shoot of metal which some one\r\nhas prospected before you. The idea is exploded that auriferous lodes\r\nnecessarily improve in value with depth. The fact is that the metal in\r\nany lode is not, as a rule, equally continuous in any direction, but\r\noccurs in shoots dipping at various angles in the length of the lode, in\r\nbunches or sometimes in horizontal layers. Nothing but actual exploiting\r\nwith pick, powder, and brains, particularly brains, will determine this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nWhere there are several parallel lodes and a rich chute has been found\r\nin one and the length of the payable ore ascertained, the neighbouring\r\nlodes should be carefully prospected opposite to the rich spot, as often\r\nsimilar valuable deposits will thus be found. Having ascertained that\r\nyou have, say, a gold reef payable at surface and for a reasonable\r\ndistance along its course, you next want to ascertain its underlie or\r\ndip, and how far the payable gold goes down.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing in many parts of Australia--though by no means an\r\ninflexible rule--a reef running east of north and west of south will\r\nunderlie east; if west of north and east of south it will go down to the\r\nwestward and so round the points of the compass till you come to east\r\nand west; when if the strike of the lodes in the neighbourhood has come\r\nround from north-east to east and west the underlie will be to the\r\nsouth; if the contrary was the case, to the north. It is surprising how\r\noften this mode of occurrence will be found to obtain. But I cannot too\r\nstrongly caution the prospector not to trust to theory but to prove his\r\nlode and his metal by following it down on the underlie. “Stick to your\r\ngold” is an excellent motto. As a general thing it is only when the lode\r\nhas been proved by an underlie shaft to water level and explored by\r\ndriving on its course for a reasonable distance that one need begin to\r\nthink of vertical shafts and the scientific laying out of the mine.\r\n\r\nA first prospecting shaft need not usually be more than 5 ft. by 3 ft.\r\nor even 5 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in., particularly in dry country. One may often\r\nsee in hard country stupid fellows wasting time, labour, and explosives\r\nin sinking huge excavations as much as 10 ft. by 8 ft. in solid rock,\r\nsometimes following down 6 inches of quartz.\r\n\r\nWhen your shaft is sunk a few feet, you should begin to log up the top\r\nfor at least 3 ft. or 4 ft., so as to get a tip for your “mullock” and\r\nlode stuff. This is done by getting a number of logs, say 6 inches\r\ndiameter, lay one 7 ft. log on each side of your shaft, cut two notches\r\nin it 6 ft. apart opposite the ends of the shaft, lay across it a 5 ft.\r\nlog similarly notched, so making a frame like a large Oxford picture\r\nframe. Continue this by piling one set above another till the desired\r\nheight is attained, and on the top construct a rough platform and erect\r\nyour windlass (Fig. 7). If you have an iron handle and axle I need not\r\ntell you how to set up a windlass, but where timber is scarce you may\r\nput together the winding appliance described in the chapter headed\r\n“Rules of Thumb.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 7. DOUBLE WINDLASS WITH LOGGED UP BRACE.]\r\n\r\nIf you have “struck it rich” you will have the pleasure of seeing your\r\nprimitive windlass grow to a “whip,” a “whim,” and eventually to a big\r\npowerful engine, with its huge drum and Eiffel tower-like “poppet heads”\r\nor “derrick,” with their great spindle pulley wheels revolving at dizzy\r\nspeed high in air.\r\n\r\n“How shall I know if I have payable gold so as to save time and trouble\r\nin sinking?” says the novice. Truly it is a most important part of the\r\nprospector’s art, whether he be searching for alluvial or reef gold or\r\nany other valuable metal.\r\n\r\nI presume you know gold when you see it?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE III.--WHIN. _To face p. 28._]\r\n\r\nIf you don’t, and the doubtful particle is coarse enough, take a needle\r\nand stick the point into the questionable specimen. If gold the steel\r\npoint will readily prick it; if pyrites or yellow mica the point will\r\nglance off or only scratch it.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the first prospect from the reef is well shown\r\nby the breathless intensity with which the two bearded, bronzed pioneer\r\nprospectors in some trackless Australian wild bend over the pan in which\r\nthe senior “mate” is slowly reducing the sample of powdered lode stuff.\r\nHow eagerly they examine the last pinch of “black sand” in the corner of\r\nthe dish. Prosperity and easy times, or poverty and more “hard graft”\r\nshall shortly be revealed in the last dexterous turn of the pan. Let us\r\nhope it is a “pay prospect.”\r\n\r\nThe learner, if he be far afield and without appliances of any kind, can\r\nonly guess his prospect. An old prospector will judge from six ounces of\r\nlode stuff within a few pennyweights of what will be the yield of a ton.\r\nI have seen many a good prospect broken with the head of a pick and\r\npanned in a shovel, but for reef prospecting you should have a pestle\r\nand mortar. The handiest for travelling is a mortar made from a mercury\r\nbottle cut in half, and a not too heavy wrought iron pestle with a\r\nhardened face. To be particular you require a screen in order to get\r\nyour stuff to regulated fineness. The best for the prospector, who is\r\noften on the move, is made from a piece of cheesecloth stretched over a\r\nsmall hoop.\r\n\r\nIf you would be more particular take a small spring balance or an\r\nimprovised scale, such as is described in Mr. Goyder’s excellent little\r\nbook, p. 14, which will enable you to weigh down to one-thousandth of a\r\ngrain. It is often desirable to burn your stone before crushing, as it\r\nis thus more easily triturated and will reveal all its gold; but\r\nremember, that if it originally contained much pyrites, unless a similar\r\ncourse is adopted when treated in the battery, some of the gold will be\r\nlost in the pyrites.\r\n\r\nHaving crushed your gangue to a fine powder you proceed to pan it off in\r\na similar manner to that of washing out alluvial earth, except that in\r\nprospecting quartz one has to be much more particular, as the gold is\r\nusually finer. The pan is taken in both hands, and enough water to\r\ncover the prospect by a few inches is admitted. The whole is then\r\nswirled round, and the dirty water poured off from time to time till the\r\nresidue is clean quartz sand and heavy metal. Then the pan is gently\r\ntipped, and a side to side motion is given to it, thus causing the\r\nheavier contents to settle down in the “corner” or angle. Next the water\r\nis carefully lapped in over the side, the pan being now tilted at a\r\ngreater angle until the lighter particles are all washed away. Nearly\r\nall the water is got rid of, and the pan is then once more righted, and\r\nthe small amount of remaining water is passed over the pinch of heavy\r\nmineral a few times, when the gold will be revealed in a streak along\r\nthe bottom. In this operation, as in all others, only practice will make\r\nperfect, and a few practical lessons are worth whole pages of written\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nTo make an amalgamating assay that will prove the amount of gold which\r\ncan be got from a ton of your lode, take a number of samples from\r\ndifferent parts, both length and breadth. The drillings from the\r\nblasting bore-holes collected make the best test. When finely triturated\r\nweigh off one or two pounds, place in a black iron pan (it must not be\r\ntinned), with 4 ozs. of mercury, 4 ozs. salt, 4 ozs. soda, and about\r\nhalf a gallon of boiling water; then, with a stick, stir the pulp\r\nconstantly, occasionally swirling the dish as in panning off, till you\r\nfeel certain that every particle of the gangue has come in contact with\r\nthe mercury; then carefully pan off into another dish so as to lose no\r\nmercury. Having got your amalgam clean squeeze it through a piece of\r\nchamois leather, though a good quality of new calico previously wetted\r\nwill do as well. The resulting pill of hard amalgam can then be wrapped\r\nin a piece of brown paper, placed on an old shovel, and the mercury\r\ndriven off over a hot fire; or a clay tobacco pipe, the mouth being\r\nstopped with clay, makes a good retort (see “Rules of Thumb,” pipe and\r\npotato retorting). The residue will be retorted gold, which, on being\r\nweighed and the result multiplied by 2240 for a 1 lb. assay, or by 1120\r\nfor 2 lb., will give the amount of gold per ton which an ordinary\r\nbattery might be expected to save. Thus 1 grain to the pound, 2240 lbs.\r\nto the ton, would show that the stuff contained 4 oz. 13 dwt. 8 gr. per\r\nton.\r\n\r\nIf there should be much base metal in your sample such as say stibnite\r\n(sulphide of antimony), a most troublesome combination to the\r\namalgamator--instead of the formula mentioned above add to your mercury\r\nabout one dwt. of zinc shavings or clippings, and to your water\r\nsufficient sulphuric acid to bring it to about the strength of vinegar\r\n(weaker, if anything, not stronger), place your material preferably in\r\nan earthenware or enamelled basin if procurable, but iron will do, and\r\nintimately mix by stirring and shaking till the mercury has taken up all\r\nit can. Retort as before described. This device is my own invention.\r\nNever use the same pan for mercury and for prospecting, as the mercury\r\nhides the gold by coating it.\r\n\r\nThe only genuine test after all is the battery, and that, owing to\r\nvarious causes, is often by no means satisfactory. First, there is a\r\nstrong, almost unconquerable temptation to select the stone, thus making\r\nthe testing of a few tons give an unduly high average; but more often\r\nthe trouble is the other way. The stuff is sent to be treated at some\r\ninefficient battery with worn-out mortars, shaky foundations, and uneven\r\ntables, sometimes with the plates not half amalgamated, or coated with\r\nimpurities, the whole concern superintended by a man who knows as little\r\nabout the treatment of auriferous quartz by the amalgamating or any\r\nother process as a dingo does of the differential calculus. Result: 3\r\ndwt. to the ton in the retort, 30 dwt. in the tailings, and a payable\r\nclaim declared a “duffer.”\r\n\r\nWhen the lode is really rich, particularly if it be carrying coarse\r\ngold, and owing to rough country, or distance, a good battery is not\r\navailable, excellent results in a small way may be obtained by the\r\nsomewhat laborious, but simple, process of “dollying.” A dolly is a one\r\nman power single stamp battery, or rather an extra sized pestle and\r\nmortar (see “Rules of Thumb,” p. 152).\r\n\r\nSilver lodes and lodes which frequently carry more or less gold, are\r\noften found beneath the dark ironstone “blows,” composed of\r\nconglomerates held together by ferric and manganic oxides; or, where the\r\nore is galena, the surface indications will frequently be a whitish\r\nlimey track, sometimes extending for miles, and nodules or “slugs” of\r\nthat ore will generally be found on the surface from place to place.\r\nMost silver ores are easily recognisable, and readily tested by means of\r\nthe blowpipe or simple fire assay. Sometimes the silver on being tested\r\nis found to contain a considerable percentage of gold, as in the great\r\nComstock lode in Nevada. Ore from the big Broken Hill silver lode, New\r\nSouth Wales, also contains an appreciable quantity of the more precious\r\nmetal. A natural alloy of gold, termed electrum, contains 20 per cent.\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nTin, lode, and stream, or alluvial, occurs only as an oxide, termed\r\ncassiterite, and yet you can well appreciate the compliment one Cornish\r\nminer pays to another whose cleverness he wishes to commend, when he\r\nsays of him, “Aw, he do knaw tin,” when you look at a representative\r\ncollection of tin ores. In various shapes, from sharp-edged crystals to\r\nmammillary-shaped nuggets of wood-tin; from masses of 30 lbs. weight to\r\na fine sand, like gunpowder, in colour black, brown, grey, yellow, red,\r\nruby, white, and sometimes a mingling of several colours, it does\r\nrequire much judgment to know tin.\r\n\r\nStream tin is generally associated with alluvial gold. When such is the\r\ncase both the gold and the tin can be saved, for the yellow metal is\r\nmuch heavier. As the tin ore is an oxide which is not susceptible to\r\namalgamation, the gold can be readily separated by means of mercury.\r\n\r\nLode tin sometimes occurs in similar quartz veins to those in which gold\r\nis got, and is occasionally associated with gold. Tin is also found, as\r\nat Euriowie, in dykes, composed of quartz crystals and large scales of\r\nwhite mica, traversing the older slates. A similar occurrence takes\r\nplace at Mount Shoobridge and at Bynoe Harbour, in the Northern\r\nTerritory of South Australia; indeed, one could not readily separate the\r\nstone from these three places if it were mixed. As before stated tin\r\nwill never be found far from granite, and that granite must have white\r\nmica as one of its constituents. It is seldom found in the darker\r\ncoloured rocks, or in limestone country, but it sometimes occurs in\r\ngneiss, mica schist, and chlorite schist. Numerous other minerals may be\r\nmistaken for tin, such as common tourmaline or schorl, garnet, wolfram\r\n(a tungstate of iron with manganese), rutile or titanic acid, blackjack\r\nor zinc blende, together with magnetic, titanic, and specular iron in\r\nfine grains.\r\n\r\nThe readiest way of determining whether the ore is tin is by weight, and\r\nby scratching or crushing, when, what is called the “streak” is\r\nobtained. The colour of the tin streak is whitey-grey, which, when once\r\nknown, is not easily mistaken. The specific gravity is about 7·0.\r\nWolfram, which is most like it, is a little heavier, from 7·0 to 7·5,\r\nbut its streak is red, brown, or blackish-brown. Rutile is much lighter,\r\n4·2, and the streak light-brown; tourmaline is only 3·2. Blackjack is\r\n4·3, and its streak yellowish-white. I have seen several pounds’ weight\r\nto the dish got in some of the New South Wales shallow sinking\r\ntin-fields, and, as a rule, payable gold was also present. Twenty-three\r\nyears ago I told Western Australian people that the neighbourhood of the\r\nDarling range would produce rich tin, which it has done lately; there is\r\npromise of a great development of the tin industry here. The tin “wash”\r\nin question is reported to yield payable gold.\r\n\r\nMetals are easily distinguished from non-metals by their lustre,\r\ntoughness, fusibility, opaqueness, conductivity, and rusting. Most\r\nmetals can be bent, twisted, drawn, and hammered to a degree not\r\npossible in non-metals.\r\n\r\nSodium, potassium, lithium, and in a somewhat less degree, calcium,\r\nstrontium, and barium, will rust almost immediately when exposed to\r\nmoist air, and their white rusts quickly dissolve in water. Another\r\ngroup of metals, zinc, lead, magnesium, and antimony, have white rusts\r\nwhich are not soluble in water. Their rusts form a thin, adherent\r\ncoating, which gives the surface of the metal a dull appearance without\r\naltogether concealing it. At higher temperatures than ordinary, if the\r\nmetals are finely divided, the chemical energy of rusting is so great\r\nthat the metals burn with a vivid light and give off a dense white\r\nsmoke. The permanency of these rusts and their protective character are\r\nutilised in white paints.\r\n\r\nA third group of metals have coloured rusts, _e.g._, silver, copper, and\r\niron. A fourth group never rust, such as gold and platinum, which occur\r\nas metals in the gangue, not as ore from which the metal is produced. In\r\nthe case of the other metals it is an advantage that they are found in\r\nthe rust or ore condition, as they can be manufactured much more easily\r\nthan native metal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    THE GENESIOLOGY OF GOLD--AURIFEROUS LODES\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to a comparatively recent time it was considered heretical for any\r\none to advance the theory that gold had been deposited where found by\r\nany other agency than that of fire. As late as 1860 Mr. Henry Rosales\r\nconvinced himself, and apparently the Victorian Government also, that\r\nquartz veins with their enclosed metal had been ejected from the\r\ninterior of the earth in a molten state. His essay, which is very\r\ningenious and cleverly written, obtained a prize which the Government\r\nhad offered, but probably Mr. Rosales himself would not adduce the same\r\narguments in support of the volcanic or igneous theory to-day. His\r\nphraseology is very technical; so much so that the ordinary inquirer\r\nwill find it somewhat difficult to follow his reasoning or understand\r\nhis arguments, which have apparently been founded only on the occurrence\r\nof gold in some of the earlier discovered quartz lodes, and the\r\nconclusions at which he arrived are not borne out by later experience.\r\nHe says:--“While, however, there are no apparent signs of mechanical\r\ndisturbances, during the long period that elapsed from the cooling of\r\nthe earth’s surface to the deposition of the Silurian and Cambrian\r\nsystems, it is to be presumed that the internal igneous activity of the\r\nearth’s crust was in full force, so that on the inner side of it, in\r\nobedience to the laws of specific gravity, chemical attraction, and\r\ncentrifugal force, a great segregation of silica in a molten state took\r\nplace. This molten silica continually accumulating, spreading, and\r\npressing against the horizontal Cambro-Silurian beds during a long\r\nperiod at length forced its way through the superincumbent strata in all\r\ndirections; and it is abundantly evident, under the conditions of this\r\nforce and the resistance offered to its action, that the line it would\r\nand must choose would be along any continuous and slightly inclined\r\ndiagonal, at times crossing the strata of the schists, though generally\r\npreferring to develop itself and egress between the cleavage planes and\r\ndividing seams of the different schistose beds.”\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say, “Another argument to the same end (_i.e._, the\r\nigneous origin) may be shown from the fact that the auriferous quartz\r\nlodes have exercised a manifest metamorphic action on the adjacent walls\r\nor casing; they have done so partly in a mineralogical sense, but\r\ngenerally there has been a metamorphic alteration of the rock.” Mr.\r\nRosales then tells his readers, what we all know must be the case, that\r\nthe gold would be volatilised by the heat, as would be also the other\r\nmetals, which he says, were in the form of arseniurets and sulphurets;\r\nbut he fails to explain how the sublimated metals afterwards reassumed\r\ntheir metallic form. Seeing that, in most cases, they would be\r\nhermetically enclosed in molten and quickly solidifying silica they\r\ncould not be acted on to any great extent by aqueous agency. Neither\r\ndoes Mr. Rosales’s theory account at all for auriferous lodes; which\r\nbelow water level are composed of a solid mass of sulphide of iron with\r\ntraces of other sulphides, gold, calcspar, and a comparatively small\r\npercentage of silica. Nor will it satisfactorily explain the auriferous\r\nantimonial silica veins of the New England district, New South Wales, in\r\nwhich quantities of angular and unaltered fragments of slate from the\r\nenclosing rocks are found imbedded in the quartz.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the metamorphism of the enclosing rocks to a greater\r\ndegree of hardness, which Mr. Rosales considered was due to heat, it\r\nshould be remembered that these rocks in their original state were much\r\nsofter and more readily fusible than the quartz, consequently all would\r\nhave been molten and mingled together instead of showing as a rule\r\nclearly defined walls. It is much more rational to suppose that the\r\nincreased hardness imparted to the slates and schists at or near their\r\ncontact with the lode is due to an infiltration of silica from the\r\nsilicated solution which at one time filled the fissure. Few scientists\r\ncan now be found to advance the purely igneous theory of lode\r\nformation, though it must be admitted that volcanic action has probably\r\nhad much influence not only in the formation of mineral veins, but also\r\non the occurrence of the minerals therein. But the action was\r\nhydro-thermal, just such as was seen in course of operation in New\r\nZealand a few years ago when, in the Rotomahana district, one could\r\nactually see the growing of the marvellous White and Pink Terraces\r\nformed by the release of silica from the boiling water exuding from the\r\nhot springs, which water, so soon as the heat and pressure were removed,\r\nbegan to deposit its silica very rapidly; while at the Thames\r\nGold-field, in the same country hot, silicated water continuously boiled\r\nout of the walls of some of the lodes after the quartz had been removed\r\nand re-deposited a siliceous sinter thereon.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I note the recently published opinions of Professor\r\nLobley, a gentleman whose scientific reputation entitles his utterances\r\nto respect, but who, when he contends that gold is not found in the\r\nproducts of volcanic action is, I venture to think, arguing from\r\ninsufficient premisses. Certainly his theories do not hold good either\r\nin Australasia or America where gold is often, nay, more usually, found\r\nat, or near, either present or past regions of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nIt is always gratifying to have one’s theories confirmed by men whose\r\nopinions carry weight in the scientific world. About twenty-four years\r\nago I first published certain theories on gold deposition, which, even\r\nthen, were held by many practical men, and some scientists, to be open\r\nto question. Of late years, however, the theory of gold occurrence by\r\ndeposition from mineral salts has been accepted by all but the “mining\r\nexperts” who infest and afflict the gold mining camps of the world.\r\nThese opine that gold ought to occur in “pockets” only (meaning thereby\r\ntheir own).\r\n\r\nRecently Professor Joseph Le Conte, at a meeting of the American\r\nInstitute of Mining Engineers, criticised a notable essay on the\r\n“Genesis of Ore Deposits,” by Bergrath F. Posepny. The Professor’s\r\ngeneral conclusions are:\r\n\r\n     1. “Ore deposits, using the term in its widest sense, may\r\n     take place from any kinds of waters, but especially from alkaline\r\n     solutions, for these are the natural solvents of metallic\r\n     sulphides, and metallic sulphides are usually the original form of\r\n     such deposits.”\r\n\r\n     2. “They may take place from waters at any temperature and any\r\n     pressure, but mainly from those at high temperature and under heavy\r\n     pressure, because, on account of their great solvent power, such\r\n     waters are heavily freighted with metals.”\r\n\r\n     3. “The depositing waters may be moving in any direction, up\r\n     coming, horizontally moving, or even sometimes down-going, but\r\n     mainly up-coming; because by losing heat and pressure at every step\r\n     such waters are sure to deposit abundantly.”\r\n\r\n     4. “Deposits may take place in any kind of waterways--in open\r\n     fissures, in incipient fissures, joints, cracks, and even in porous\r\n     sandstone, but especially in great open fissures, because these are\r\n     the main highways of ascending waters from the greatest depths.”\r\n\r\n     5. “Deposits may be found in many regions and in many kinds\r\n     of rocks, but mainly in mountain regions, and in metamorphic and\r\n     igneous rocks, because the thermosphere is nearer the surface, and\r\n     ready access thereto through great fissures is found mostly in\r\n     these regions and in these rocks.”\r\n\r\nThese views are in accordance with nearly all modern research into this\r\ninteresting and fruitful subject.\r\n\r\nAmong the theories which they discredit is that ore bodies may usually\r\nbe assumed to become richer in depth. As applied to gold lodes the\r\nteaching of experience does not bear out this view.\r\n\r\nIf it be taken into account that the time in which most of our\r\nauriferous siliceous lodes were formed was probably that indicated in\r\nGenesis as before the first day or period when “the earth was without\r\nform and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep,” it will be\r\nrealised that the action we behold now taking place in a small way in\r\nvolcanic regions, was probably then almost universal. The crust of the\r\nearth had cooled sufficiently to permit water to lie on its surface,\r\nprobably in hot shallow seas, like the late Lake Rotomahana. Plutonic\r\naction would be very general, and volcanic mud, ash, and sand would be\r\nejected and spread far and wide, which, sinking to the bottom of the\r\nwater, may possibly be the origin of what we now designate the azoic or\r\nmetamorphic slates and schists, as also the early Cambrian and Silurian\r\nstrata. These, from the superincumbent weight and internal heat, became\r\ncompacted, and, in some cases, crystallised, while at the same time,\r\nfrom the ingress of the surface waters to the heated regions below,\r\nprobably millions of geysers were spouting their mineral impregnated\r\nwaters in all directions; and in places where the crust was thin,\r\nexplosions of super-heated steam caused huge upheavals, rifts, and\r\nchasms, into which these waters returned, to be again ejected, or to be\r\nthe cause of further explosions. Later, as the cooling-process\r\ncontinued, there would be shrinkages of the earth’s crust causing other\r\nfissures; intrusive granites further dislocated and upheaved the slates.\r\nAbout this age, probably, when really dry land began to appear, came the\r\nfirst formation of mineral lodes, and the waters, heavily charged with\r\nsilicates, carbonates of lime, sulphides, &c., in solution, commenced to\r\ndeposit their contents in solid form when the heat and pressure were\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nI am aware that part of the theory here propounded as to the probable\r\nmode of formation of the immense sedimentary beds of the Archaic or\r\nAzoic period is not altogether orthodox--_i.e._, that the origin of\r\nthese beds is largely due to the ejection of mud, sand, and ashes from\r\nsubterraneous sources, which, settling in shallow seas, were afterwards\r\naltered to their present form. It is difficult, however, to believe that\r\nat this very early period of geologic history so vast a time had elapsed\r\nas would be required to account for these enormous depositions of\r\nsediment, if they were the result only of the degradation of previously\r\nelevated portions of the earth’s surface by water agency. Glacial action\r\nat that time would be out of the question.\r\n\r\nBut what about the metals? Whence came the metallic gold of our reefs\r\nand drifts? What was it originally--a metal or a metallic salt, and if\r\nthe latter, what was its nature?--chloride, sulphide, or silicate, one,\r\nor all three? I incline to the latter hypothesis. All three are known,\r\nand the chemical conditions of the period were favourable for their\r\nnatural production. Assuming that they did exist, the task of accounting\r\nfor the mode of occurrence of our auriferous quartz lodes is\r\ncomparatively simple. Chloride of gold is at the present day contained\r\nin sea water and in some mineral waters, and would have been likely to\r\nbe more abundant during the Azoic and early Paleozoic period.\r\n\r\nSulphide of gold would have been produced by the action of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen; hence probably our auriferous pyrites lodes, while silicate of\r\ngold might have resulted from a combination of gold chlorides with\r\nsilicic acid, and thus the frequent presence of gold in quartz be\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nA highly interesting and instructive experiment, showing how gold might\r\nbe, and probably was, deposited in quartz veins, was carried out by\r\nProfessor Bischof some years ago. He, having prepared a solution of\r\nchloride of gold, added thereto a solution of silicate of potash,\r\nwhereupon, as he states, the yellow colour of the chloride disappeared,\r\nand in half an hour the fluid turned blue, and a gelatinous dark-blue\r\nprecipitate appeared and adhered to the sides of the vessel. In a few\r\ndays moss-like forms were seen on the surface of the precipitate,\r\npresumably approximating to what we know as dendroidal gold--that is,\r\nhaving the appearance of moss, fern, or twigs. After allowing the\r\nprecipitate to remain undisturbed under water for a month or two a\r\ndecomposition took place, and in the auriferous silicate specks of\r\nmetallic gold appeared. From this the Professor argues, and with good\r\nshow of reason, that as we know now that the origin of our quartz lodes\r\nwas the silicates contained in certain rocks, it is probable that a\r\nnatural silicate of gold may be combined with these silicates. If this\r\ncan be demonstrated, the reason for the almost universal occurrence of\r\ngold in quartz is made clear.\r\n\r\nAbout 1870, Mr. Skey, analyst to the New Zealand Geological Survey\r\nDepartment, made a number of experiments of importance in respect to the\r\noccurrence of gold. These experiments were summarised by Sir James\r\nHector in an address to the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1872.\r\nMr. Skey’s experiments disproved the view generally held that gold is\r\nunaffected by sulphur or sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and showed that\r\nthese elements combined with avidity, and that the gold thus treated\r\nresisted amalgamation with mercury. Mr. Skey proved the act of\r\nabsorption of sulphur by gold to be a chemical act, and that electricity\r\nwas generated in sufficient quantity and intensity during the process\r\nto decompose metallic solutions. Sulphur in certain forms had long been\r\nknown to exercise a prejudicial effect upon the amalgamation of gold,\r\nbut this had always been attributed to the combination of the sulphur\r\nwith the quicksilver used. Now, however, it is certain that the\r\nsulphurising of the gold must be taken into account. We must remember\r\nthat the particles of gold in the stone may be enveloped with a film of\r\nauriferous sulphide, by which they are protected from the solvent action\r\nof the mercury. The sulphurisation of the gold gives no ocular\r\nmanifestation by change of colour or perceptible increase of weight, as\r\nin the case of the formation of sulphides of silver, lead and other\r\nmetals, on account of the extremely superficial action of the sulphur,\r\nand hence probably the existence of the gold sulphide escaped detection\r\nby chemists.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to this subject is the investigation of the mode in which\r\ncertain metals are reduced from their solutions by metallic sulphides,\r\nor, in common language, the influence which the presence of such\r\nsubstances as mundic and galena may exercise in effecting the deposit of\r\npure metals, such as gold, in mineral lodes. The close relation which\r\nthe richness of gold veins bears to the prevalence of pyrites has been\r\nlong familiar both to scientific observers and to practical miners. The\r\ngold is an after deposit to the pyrites, and, as Mr. Skey was the first\r\nto explain, due to its direct reducing influences. By a series of\r\nexperiments Mr. Skey proved that the reduction of the metal was due to\r\nthe direct action of the sulphide, and showed that each grain of iron\r\npyrites, when thoroughly oxidised, will reduce 12¼ grains of gold\r\nfrom its solutions as chloride. He also included salts of platina and\r\nsilver in this general law, and demonstrated that solutions of any of\r\nthese metals traversing a vein rock containing certain sulphides would\r\nbe decomposed, and the pure metal deposited. We are thus enabled to\r\ncomprehend the constant association of gold, or native alloys of gold\r\nand silver, in veins which traverse rocks containing an abundance of\r\npyrites, whether they have been formed as the result of either\r\nsub-aqueous volcanic outbursts or by the metamorphism of the\r\ndeeper-seated strata which compose the superficial crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nMr. Skey also showed by very carefully conducted experiments that the\r\nmetallic sulphides are not only better conductors of electricity than\r\nhas hitherto been supposed, but that when paired they were capable of\r\nexhibiting strong electro-motive power. Thus, if galena and zinc blende\r\nin acid solutions be connected in the usual manner by a voltaic pair,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen is evolved from the surface of the former, and a\r\ncurrent generated which is sufficient to reduce gold, silver or copper\r\nfrom their solutions in coherent electro-plate films. The attributing of\r\nthis property of generating voltaic currents, hitherto supposed to be\r\nalmost peculiar to metals, to the common sulphides found in\r\nmetalliferous veins, led Mr. Skey to speculate how far the currents\r\ndiscovered to exist in such veins by Mr. E. F. Fox might be produced by\r\nthe gradual oxidation of mixed sulphides, and his conclusion is that\r\nveins containing bands of different metallic sulphides, bounded by\r\ncontinuing walls, and saturated with mineral waters, may constitute\r\nunder some circumstances a large voltaic battery competent to produce\r\nelectro-deposition of metals, and that the order of the deposit of these\r\nmineral lodes will be found to bear a definite relation to the order in\r\nwhich the sulphides rank in the table of their electro-motive power.\r\nThese researches may lead to some clearer comprehension of the law which\r\nregulates the distribution of auriferous veins, and may explain why in\r\nsome cases the metal should be nearly pure, while in others it is so\r\nlargely alloyed with silver.\r\n\r\nThe following extract was lately clipped from a mining paper. If true,\r\nthe experiment is interesting:--\r\n\r\n    “An American scientist has just concluded a very interesting\r\n    and suggestive experiment. He took a crushed sample of rich ore\r\n    from Cripple Creek, which carried 1,100 ozs. of gold per ton, and\r\n    digested it in a very weak solution of sodium chloride and sulphate\r\n    of iron, making the solution correspond as near as practicable to\r\n    the waters found in Nature. The ore was kept in a place having a\r\n    temperature little less than boiling water for six weeks, when all\r\n    the gold was dissolved, except what would be equal to one ounce\r\n    per ton. A few small crystals of pyrite were then placed in the\r\n    bottle of solution, and the gold began immediately to precipitate\r\n    on them. It was noticeable, however, that the pyrite crystals which\r\n    were free from zinc, galena, or other extraneous matter received no\r\n    gold precipitate. Those which had such foreign associations were\r\n    beautifully covered with fine gold crystals.”\r\n\r\nExperimenting in a somewhat similar direction about eight years ago, I\r\nfound that the West Australian mine water, mentioned on page 85, with\r\nthe addition of an acid, was a solvent of gold. The idea of boiling it\r\ndid not occur to me, as the action was fairly rapid in cold water.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that gold originally existed as a mineral salt, when and\r\nhow did it take metallic form? Doubtless, just in the same manner as we\r\nnow (by means of well-known reagents which are common in nature)\r\nprecipitate it in the laboratory. With regard to that found in quartz\r\nlodes finely disseminated through the gangue, the change was brought\r\nabout by the same agency which caused the silicic acid to solidify and\r\ntake the form in which we now see it in the quartz veins. Silica is\r\nsoluble in solutions of alkaline carbonates, as shown in New Zealand\r\ngeysers; the solvent action being increased by heat and pressure, so\r\nalso would be the silicate or sulphide of gold. When, however, the\r\nwaters with their contents were released from internal pressure and\r\nbegan to lose their heat the gold would be precipitated together with\r\nthe salts of some other metals, and would, where the waters could\r\npercolate, begin to accretionise, thus forming the heavy or specimen\r\ngold of some reefs. On this class of deposition I shall have more to say\r\nwhen treating of the origin of alluvial gold in the form of nuggets.\r\n\r\nMr. G. F. Becker, of the United States Geological Survey, writing of the\r\ngeology of the Comstock lode, says:--“Baron Von Richthofen was of\r\nopinion that fluorine and chlorine had played a large part in the ore\r\ndeposition in the Comstock, and this the writer is not disposed to deny;\r\nbut, on the other hand, it is plain that most of the phenomena are\r\nsufficiently accounted for on the supposition that the agents have been\r\nmerely solutions of carbonic and hydrosulphuric acids. These reagents\r\nwill attack the bisilicates and felspars. The result would be carbonates\r\nand sulphides of metals, earths, alkalies, and free quartz, but quartz\r\nand sulphides of the metals are soluble in solutions of carbonates and\r\nsulphides of the earths and alkalies, and the essential constituents of\r\nthe ore might, therefore, readily be conveyed to openings in the vein\r\nwhere they would have been deposited on relief of pressure and\r\ndiminution of temperature. An advance boring on the 3000 ft. level of\r\nthe Yellow Jacket struck a powerful stream of water at 3065 ft. (in the\r\nwest country), which was heavily charged with hydrogen sulphide, and had\r\na temperature of 170° F., and there is equal evidence of the presence of\r\ncarbonic acid in the water of the lower levels. A spring on the 2700 ft.\r\nlevel of the Yellow Jacket which showed a temperature of about 150° F.,\r\nwas found to be depositing a sinter largely composed of carbonates.”\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while here to speak of the probable reason why gold, and\r\nindeed, almost all the metals generally occur in chutes in the lodes;\r\nand why, as is often the case, these chutes are found to be more or less\r\nin a line with each other in parallel lodes, and why also the junction\r\nof two lodes is frequently specially productive. The theory with respect\r\nto these phenomena which appears most feasible is, that at these points\r\ncertain chemical action has taken place, by which the deposition of the\r\nmetals has been specially induced. Generally a careful examination of\r\nthe enclosing rocks where the chute is found will reveal some points of\r\ndifference from the enclosing rocks at other parts of the course of the\r\nlode, and when ore chutes are found parallel in reefs running on the\r\nsame course, bands or belts of similar country rock will be found at the\r\nproductive points. From this we may fairly reason that at these points\r\nthe slow stream filling the lode cavity met with a reagent percolating\r\nfrom this particular band of rock, which caused the deposition of its\r\nmetals; and, indeed, I am strongly disposed to believe that the\r\ndeposition of metals, particularly in some loose lodes, may even now be\r\nproceeding. But as in Nature’s laboratory the processes, if certain, are\r\nslow, this theory may be difficult to prove.\r\n\r\nWhy the junction of lodes is often found to be more richly metalliferous\r\nthan neighbouring parts is probably because there the depositing\r\nreagents met. This theory is well put by Mr. S. Herbert Cox, late of\r\nSydney, in his useful book, “Mines and Minerals.” He says:--“It is a\r\nwell-known fact in all mining districts that the junctions of lodes are\r\ngenerally the richest points, always supposing that this junction takes\r\nplace in ‘kindly country,’ and the explanation of this we think is\r\nsimple on the aqueous theory of filling of lodes. The water which is\r\ntraversing two different channels of necessity passes through different\r\nbelts of country, and will thus have different minerals in solution. As\r\na case in point, let us suppose that the water in one lode contained in\r\nsolution carbonates of lime, and the alkalies and silica derived from a\r\ndecomposition of felspars; and that the other, charged with\r\nhydrosulphuric acid, brought with it sulphide of gold dissolved in\r\nsulphide of lime. The result of these two waters meeting would be that\r\ncarbonate of lime would be formed, hydrosulphuric acid would be set\r\nfree, and sulphide of gold would be deposited, as well as silica, which\r\nwas formerly held in solution by the carbonic acid.”\r\n\r\nMost practical men who have given the subject attention will, I think,\r\nbe disposed to coincide with this view, though there are some who hold\r\nthat the occurrence of these parallel ore chutes and rich deposits at\r\nthe junctions of lodes is due to extraneous electrical agency. Of this,\r\nhowever, I have failed to find any satisfactory evidence.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, proof that lodes are actually re-forming and the\r\naction observed is very interesting as showing how the stratification in\r\nsome lodes has come about. The growth of silica on the sides of the\r\ndrives has occurred in some of the mines on the Thames gold-fields, New\r\nZealand (p. 36), where in some cases the deposition was so rapid as to\r\nbe noticeable from day to day, whilst the big pump, which drained all\r\nthe mines in the vicinity, was actually choked by siliceous deposits. In\r\nold auriferous workings which have been under water for years, in many\r\nparts of the world, formations of iron and silica have been found on the\r\nwalls and roof, while in mining tunnels which have been long unused\r\nstalactites composed of silica and calcite have formed. Then, again,\r\nexperiments made by the late Professor Cosmo Newbery, in Victoria,\r\nshowed that a distinctly appreciable amount of gold, iron, and silica\r\n(the latter in granular form) could be extracted from solid mine timber,\r\nwhich had been submerged for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nThis reaction then must be in progress at the present time, and\r\ndoubtless under certain conditions pyrites would eventually take the\r\nplace of the timber, as is the case with some of the long buried\r\ndriftwood found in Victorian deep leads. Again, we know that the water\r\nfrom some copper mines is so charged with copper sulphate that if scrap\r\niron be thrown into it, the iron will be taken up by the sulphuric acid,\r\nand metallic copper deposited in its place. All this tends to prove that\r\nthe deposition of metals from their salts, though probably not now as\r\nrapid as formerly, is still ceaselessly going on in some place or\r\nanother where the necessary conditions are favourable.\r\n\r\nQuite unexpectedly I lately came across these lines in Dryden’s _Annus\r\nMirabilis_, verse cxxxix.:--\r\n\r\n    “As those who unripe veins in mines explore,\r\n        On the rich bed again the warm turf lay,\r\n    Till time digests the yet imperfect ore,\r\n        And know it will be gold another day.”\r\n\r\n    _Is_ there “any new thing under the sun?”\r\n\r\nWith regard to auriferous pyritous lodes, it does not appear even now to\r\nbe clear, as some scientists assert, that their gold is never found in\r\nchemical combination with the sulphides of the base metals. On the\r\ncontrary, I think much of the evidence points in the other direction.\r\n\r\nI have long been of opinion that it is really so held in many of the\r\nferro-sulphides and arsenio-ferro sulphides. On this subject Mr. T.\r\nAtherton contributed a short article in 1891 to the _Australian Mining\r\nStandard_ which is worthy of notice. He says, referring to an occurrence\r\nof a Natural Sulphide of Gold:--“The existence of gold, in the form of a\r\nnatural sulphide in conjunction with pyrites, has often been advanced\r\ntheoretically, as a possible occurrence; but up to the present time has,\r\nI believe, never been established as an actual fact.” During my\r\ninvestigations on the ore of the Deep Creek mines, Nambucca, New South\r\nWales, I found in them what I believe to be gold existing as a natural\r\nsulphide. The lode is a large irregular one of pure arsenical pyrites\r\ncarrying, in addition to gold and silver, nickel and cobalt. It exists\r\nin a felsite dyke immediately on the coast. Surrounding it on all sides\r\nare micaceous schists, and in the neighbourhood about half a mile\r\ndistant is a large granite hill about 800 feet high. In the lode and its\r\nwalls are large quantities of pyrophyllite, and in some parts of the\r\nmine there are deposits of pure white translucent mica, but in the ore\r\nitself it is a yellow or pale olive green, and is never absent from the\r\npyrites.\r\n\r\nFrom the first I was much struck with the exceedingly fine state of\r\ndivision in which the gold existed in the ore. After roasting and very\r\ncarefully grinding down in an agate mortar, I have never been able to\r\nget any pieces of gold exceeding one-thousandth of an inch in diameter,\r\nand the greater quantity is very much finer than this. Careful\r\ndissolving of the pyrites and gangue so as to leave the gold intact\r\nfailed to find it in any larger diameter. As this was a very unusual\r\nexperience in investigations on many other kinds of pyrites, I was led\r\nfurther into the matter.\r\n\r\nUltimately, after a number of experiments, there was nothing left but to\r\ntest for gold existing as a natural sulphide. Taking 200 gr. of gold\r\nfrom a sample assaying 17 oz. fine gold per ton, grinding it finely and\r\nheating for some hours with yellow sodium sulphide--on decomposing the\r\nfiltrate and treating for gold I got a result at the rate of 12 oz. per\r\nton. This was repeated several times with the same result.\r\n\r\nThis sample came from the lode at the 140 ft. level, whilst samples from\r\nthe higher levels where the ore is more oxidised, although carrying the\r\ngold in exactly the same degree of fineness, do not give as high a\r\npercentage of auric sulphide.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that all the gold in the pyrites (and I have never found\r\nany gold existing apart from the pyrites) has originally taken its place\r\nthere as a sulphide.\r\n\r\nThe following is an analysis of a general sample insoluble in\r\nnitro-sulphuric acid:--\r\n\r\n  20·532 per cent, consisting of {Silica       13·940 per cent.\r\n                                 {Alumina       6·592     ”\r\n                                  Lime          0·903     ”\r\n                                  Sulphur      16·584     ”\r\n                                  Arsenic      33·267     ”\r\n                                  Iron         27·720     ”\r\n                                  Cobalt        0·964     ”\r\n                                  Nickel       Traces.\r\n  (5 oz.  3 dwt. 8 gr. per ton)   Gold            --\r\n  (0 oz. 16 dwt. 0 gr.   ”    )   Silver          --\r\n                                                -------\r\n                                  Total         99·970    ”\r\n\r\nProfessor Newbery, who made many valuable suggestions on the subject,\r\nsays, speaking of gold in pyritous lodes:--\r\n\r\n    “As it (the gold salt) may have been in the same solution\r\n    that deposited the pyrites, which probably contained its iron in\r\n    the form of proto-carbonate with sulphates, it was not easy at\r\n    first to imagine any ordinary salt of iron; but this I find can\r\n    be accomplished with very dilute solutions in the presence of an\r\n    alkaline carbonate and a large excess of carbonic acid, both of\r\n    which are common constituents of mineral waters, especially in\r\n    Victoria. This is true of chloride of gold, and if the sulphide is\r\n    required in solution, it is only necessary to charge the solution\r\n    with an excess of sulphuretted hydrogen. In this manner both\r\n    sulphides may be retained in the same solution, depositing gradually\r\n    with the escape of the carbonic acid.”\r\n\r\nPyritous lodes usually contain a considerable proportion of calcareous\r\nmatter, mostly carbonates, and consequently it appears not improbable\r\nthat the gold may remain in some instances as a sulphide, particularly\r\nin samples of pyrites, in which it cannot be detected even by the\r\nmicroscope until by calcination the iron sulphide is changed to an\r\noxide, wherein the gold may be seen in minute metallic specks. The whole\r\nsubject is full of interest, and careful scientific investigation may\r\nlead to astonishing results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    THE GENESIOLOGY OF GOLD--AURIFEROUS DRIFTS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving considered the origin of auriferous lodes, and the mode by which\r\nin all probability the gold was conveyed to them and deposited as a\r\nmetal, it is necessary also to inquire into the derivation of the gold\r\nof our auriferous drifts, and the reasons for its occurrence therein.\r\n\r\nWhen quite a lad on the Victorian alluvial fields, I frequently heard\r\nold diggers assert that gold grew in the drifts where found. At the time\r\nwe understood this to mean that it grew like potatoes; and, although not\r\nprepared with a scientific argument to prove that such was not so, the\r\nidea was generally laughed at. I have lived to learn that these old\r\nhard-heads were nearer the truth than possibly they clearly realised,\r\nand that gold does actually grow or agglomerate; and, indeed, is\r\nprobably even now thus growing, though it is likely that the chemical\r\nand electric action in the mineral waters flowing through the drifts is\r\nnot in this age nearly so active as formerly.\r\n\r\nMost boys have tried the experiment of dipping a clean-bladed knife into\r\nsulphate of copper, and so depositing on the steel a film of copper,\r\nwhich adheres closely until worn away. This is a simple demonstration of\r\na hydro-metallurgical process, though probably young hopeful is not\r\naware of the fact; and it is really by an enlargement of this process\r\nthat our beautiful and artistic gold-and silver-plated ware is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIn the great laboratory of Nature similar chemical depositions have\r\ntaken place in the past, and may still be in progress; indeed, there is\r\nsound scientific reason to suppose that in certain localities this is\r\neven now the case, and that in this way much of our so-called alluvial\r\ngold has been formed, that is, by the deposition on metallic bases of\r\nthe gold held in solution.\r\n\r\nWe will, however, take, to begin with, the generally accepted theory as\r\nto the occurrence of alluvial gold. First, let it be said, that certain\r\nalluvial gold is unquestionably derived from the denudation of quartz\r\nlodes. Such is the gold dust found in many Asiatic and African rivers,\r\nin the great placer mines of California, as also the gold dust gained\r\nfrom the beach sand on the west coast of New Zealand, or in the enormous\r\nalluvial drifts of the Shoalhaven Valley, New South Wales. Of the first,\r\nmany fabulous tales are told to account for its being found in\r\nparticular spots each summer after the winter floods, and miraculous\r\nagency was asserted, while the early beachcombers of the Hokitika\r\ndistrict found an equally ridiculous derivation for their gold, which\r\nwas always more plentiful after heavy weather. They imagined that the\r\nbreakers were disintegrating some abnormally rich auriferous reefs out\r\nat sea, and that the resultant gold was washed up on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe facts are simply, with regard to the rivers, that the winter floods\r\nbreak down the drifts in the banks and agitate the auriferous detritus,\r\nthus acting as natural sluices, and cause the metal to accumulate in\r\nfavourable spots; whilst on the New Zealand coast the heavy seas\r\nbreaking on the shingly beach, carry off the lighter particles, leaving\r\nbehind the gold, which is so much heavier. These beaches are composed,\r\nas also are the “terraces” behind, of enormous glacial and fluvial\r\ndeposits, all containing more or less gold, and extend inland to the\r\nfoot of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that the usually fine gold got by hydraulicing in\r\nCalifornian cañons, in the gullies of the New Zealand Alps, and the\r\ngreat New South Wales drifts, is largely the result of the attrition of\r\nthe boulders and gravel of moraines, which has thus freed, to a certain\r\nextent, the auriferous particles. But when we find large nuggety masses\r\nof high carat gold in the beds of dead rivers, another origin has to be\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, there is fair reason to assume that at least three\r\nsalts of gold have existed, and, possibly, may still be found, in\r\nNature--silicate, sulphide, and chloride. All of these are soluble and\r\nin the presence of certain reagents, also existing naturally, can be\r\ndeposited in metallic form. Therefore, if, as is contended, reef gold\r\nwas formed with the reefs from solutions in mineral waters, by\r\ninferential reasoning it can be shown that much of our alluvial gold was\r\nsimilarly derived.\r\n\r\nThe commonly accepted theory, however, is that the alluvial gold of our\r\ndrifts has been ground out of the solid siliceous lodes by glacial and\r\nfluvial action, and that the auriferous leads have been formed by the\r\nnatural sluicing operations of former streams. To this, however, there\r\nare several insuperable objections.\r\n\r\nFirst, how comes it that alluvial gold is usually superior in purity to\r\nthe “reef” gold immediately adjacent? Second, why are masses of gold,\r\nsuch as the huge nuggets found in Victoria and New South Wales, never\r\nbeen discovered in lodes? Third, why are these heavy masses which, from\r\ntheir specific gravity, should be found only at the very bottom of the\r\ndrifts, if placed there by water action, sometimes found in all\r\npositions from the surface to the bottom of the wash? And, lastly, why\r\nis it that when an alluvial lead is traced up to, or down from, an\r\nauriferous reef, that the light, angular gold lies close to the reef,\r\nwhile the heavy masses are often bedded much farther away? Any one who\r\nhas worked a ground sluice knows how extremely difficult it is with a\r\nstrong head of water to shift from its position an ounce of solid gold.\r\nWhat, then, would be the fluvial force required to move the Welcome\r\nNugget? Under certain circumstances, Niagara itself would not be equal\r\nto the task.\r\n\r\nThe generally smooth appearance of alleged alluvial gold is adduced as\r\nan argument in favour of its having been carried by water from its\r\noriginal place of deposit, and thus in transit become waterworn; while\r\nsome go so far as to say that it was shot out of the reefs in a molten\r\nstate. The latter idea has been already disposed of, but if not, it may\r\nbe dismissed with the statement that the heat which would melt silica in\r\nthe masses met with in lodes would sublimate any gold contained, and\r\ndissipate it, not in nuggets but in fumes. With regard to the assumed\r\nwaterworn appearance of alluvial gold, I have examined with the\r\nmicroscope the smooth surface of more than one apparently waterworn\r\nnugget, and found that it was not scratched and abraded, as would have\r\nbeen the case had it been really waterworn, but that it presented the\r\nsame appearance, though infinitely finer in grain, as the surface of a\r\npiece of metal fresh from the electrical plating-bath.\r\n\r\nLet us then try if we cannot suggest, if not a complete answer to the\r\nmany perplexing problems which trouble the alluvial miner, at least a\r\ntheory that will bear investigation, and by the application of which\r\nmany apparent paradoxes may be explained. While admitting that certain\r\nalluvial gold has been ground out of its siliceous matrix, and\r\ndistributed and re-collected by water action, we may inquire what would\r\nbe the result if we extend the experiment of the boy and knife, or the\r\nelectro-metallurgical bath to alluvial drifts, and show that it is not\r\nonly possible, but almost certain, that similar action has obtained, and\r\nmay now be occurring.\r\n\r\nMr. Daintree, of the Victorian Geological Survey, many years ago\r\ndiscovered accidentally that gold chloride would deposit its metal on a\r\nmetallic base in the presence of any organic substance. Mr. Daintree\r\nfound that a piece of undissolved gold in a bottle containing chloride\r\nof gold in solution had, owing to a portion of the cork having fallen\r\ninto the liquid, grown or accretionised so much that it could not be\r\nextracted through the neck. This led Mr. Charles Wilkinson, who has\r\ncontributed much to our scientific knowledge of metallurgy, to\r\nexperiment further in the same direction. He says: “Using the most\r\nconvenient salt of gold, the terchloride, and employing wood as the\r\ndecomposing agent, in order to imitate as closely as possible the\r\norganic matter supposed to decompose the solution circulating through\r\nthe drifts, I first immersed a piece of cubic iron pyrites taken from\r\nthe coal formation of Cape Otway, far distant from any of our gold\r\nrocks, and therefore less likely to contain gold than other pyrites. The\r\nspecimen (No. 1) was kept in dilute solution for about three weeks, and\r\nis completely covered with a bright film of gold. I afterwards filed off\r\nthe gold from one side of a cube crystal to show the pyrites itself and\r\nthe thickness of the surrounding coating, which is thicker than ordinary\r\nnotepaper. If the conditions had continued favourable for a very\r\nlengthened period, this specimen would doubtless have formed the nucleus\r\nof a large nugget. Iron, copper, and arsenical pyrites, antimony,\r\ngalena, molybdenite, zinc blende, and wolfram were treated in the above\r\nmanner with similar results. In the above experiments a small chip of\r\nwood was employed as the decomposing agent. In one instance I used a\r\npiece of leather. All through the wood and leather gold was disseminated\r\nin fine particles, and when cut through the characteristic metallic\r\nlustre was brightly reflected. The first six of these sulphides were\r\nalso operated upon simply in the solution without organic matter, but\r\nthey remained unaltered.”\r\n\r\nWilkinson found that when the solution of gold chloride was as strong\r\nas, say, four grains to the ounce of water, that the pyrites or other\r\nbase began to decompose, and the iron sulphide changed to yellow oxide,\r\nthe “gossan” of our lodes, and that though the gold was deposited, this\r\noccurred in an irregular way, and it was coated with a dark brown\r\npowdery film something like the “black gold,” often found in drifts\r\ncontaining much ferruginous matter. Such were the curious Victorian\r\nnuggets Spondulix and Lothair.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newbery also made a number of similar experiments, and arrived\r\nat like results. He states as follows: “I placed a cube of galena in a\r\nsolution of chloride of gold, with free access of air, and put in\r\norganic matter; gold was deposited as usual, in a bright metallic film,\r\napparently completely coating the cube. After a few months the film\r\nburst along the edges of the cube, and remained in that state with the\r\ncracks open without any further alteration in size or form being\r\napparent. Upon removing it a few days ago and breaking it open, I found\r\nthat a large portion of the galena had been decomposed, forming chloride\r\nand sulphate of lead and free sulphur, which were mixed together,\r\nencasing a small nucleus of undecomposed sulphate of lead. The formation\r\nof these salts had exerted sufficient force to burst open the gold\r\ncoating, which upon the outside had the mammillary form noticed by\r\nWilkinson, while the inside was rough and irregular with crystals\r\nforcing their way into the lead salts. Had this action continued\r\nundisturbed, the result would have been a nugget with a nucleus of lead\r\nsalts, or if there had been a current to remove the results of the\r\ndecomposition, a nugget without a nucleus of foreign matter.”\r\n\r\nBut Newbery also made another discovery which still further establishes\r\nthe probability of the accretionary growth of gold in drifts. In the\r\nfirst experiments both investigators used organic substances as the\r\nreagent to cause the deposit of gold on its base, and in each case these\r\nsubstances whether woodchips, leather, or even dead flies, were found to\r\nbe so absolutely impregnated with gold as to leave a golden skeleton\r\nwhen afterwards burned. Timber found in the Ballarat deep leads has been\r\nproved to be similarly impregnated.\r\n\r\nNewbery found that gold could also be deposited on sulphurets without\r\nany other reagent. He says: “In our mineral sulphurets, however, we have\r\nagents which are not only capable of reducing gold and silver from\r\nsolution, but besides are capable of locating them when so reduced in\r\ncoherent and bulky masses. Thus the aggregation of the nuggety forms of\r\ngold from solution becomes a still more simple matter, only one reagent\r\nbeing necessary, so that there is a greater probability of such\r\ndepositions obtaining than were a double process necessary. Knowing the\r\naction of sulphides, the manner or the mode of formation of a portion at\r\nleast of these nuggets seems apparent. Conceive a stream or river fed by\r\nsprings rising in a country intersected by auriferous reefs, and\r\nconsequently in this case carrying gold in solution; the drift of such a\r\ncountry must be to a greater or lesser extent pyritous, so that the\r\n_débris_ forming the beds of these streams or rivers will certainly\r\ncontain nodules of such matters disseminated or even stopping them in\r\nactual contact with the flow of water. It follows, then, from what has\r\nbeen previously affirmed, that there will be a reduction of gold by\r\nthese nodules, and that the metal thus reduced will be firmly attached\r\nto them, at first in minute spangles isolated from each other, but\r\nafterwards accumulating and connecting in a gradual manner at that point\r\nof the pyritous mass most subject to the current until a continuous film\r\nof some size appears. This being formed the pyrites and gold are to a\r\ncertain extent polarised, the film or irregular but connected mass of\r\ngold forming the negative, and the pyrites the positive end of a voltaic\r\npair; and so according as the polarisation is advanced to completion the\r\nfurther deposition of gold is changed in its manner from an\r\nindiscriminate to an orderly and selective deposition concentrated upon\r\nthe negative or gold plate. The deposition of gold being thus\r\ncontrolled, its loss by dispersion or from the crumbling away of the\r\nsustaining pyrites is nearly or quite prevented, a conservative effect\r\nwhich we could scarcely expect to obtain if organic matter were the\r\nreducing agent. Meanwhile there is a gradual wasting away of the pyrites\r\nor positive pole, its sulphur being oxidised to sulphuric acid and its\r\niron to sesquioxide of iron, or hematite, a substance very generally\r\nassociated with gold nuggets. According to the original size of the\r\npyritous mass, the protection it receives from the action of oxidising\r\nsubstances other than gold, the strength of the gold solution, length of\r\nexposure to it, the rate of supply and velocity of stream, will be the\r\nsize of the gold nugget. As to the size of a pyritous mass necessary to\r\nproduce in this manner a large nugget, it is by no means considerable. A\r\nmass of common pyrites (bisulphide of iron) weighing only 12 lbs. is\r\ncompetent for the construction of the famous ‘Welcome Nugget,’ an\r\nAustralian find having weight equal to 152 lbs. avoirdupois. Such masses\r\nof pyrites are by no means uncommon in our drifts or the beds of our\r\nmountain streams. Thus we find that no straining of the imagination is\r\nrequired to conceive of this mode of formation for the huge masses of\r\ngold found in Australia in particular, such as the Welcome Nugget, 184\r\nlbs. 9 oz.; the Welcome Stranger, a surface nugget, 190 lbs. after\r\nsmelting; the Braidwood specimen nugget, 350 lbs., two-thirds gold;\r\nbesides many other large masses of almost virgin gold which have been\r\nobtained from time to time in the alluvial diggings.”\r\n\r\nThe author has made a number of experiments in the same direction, but\r\nmore with the idea of demonstrating how possibly gold may in certain\r\ncases have been deposited in siliceous formations after such formations\r\nhad solidified. Some of the results were remarkable and indeed\r\nunexpected. I found that I could produce artificial specimens of\r\nauriferous quartz from stone which had previously contained no gold\r\nwhatever, also that it was not absolutely necessary that the stone so\r\ntreated should contain any metallic sulphides.\r\n\r\nThe following was contributed by the author and is from the\r\n“Transactions” of the Australasian Institute of Mining Engineers for\r\n1893:--\r\n\r\n    “THE DEPOSITION OF GOLD.\r\n\r\n    “The question as to how gold was originally deposited in our\r\n    auriferous lodes is one to which a large amount of attention has\r\n    been given, both by mineralogists and practical miners, and\r\n    which has been hotly argued by those who held the igneous theory\r\n    and those who pronounced for the aqueous theory. It was held by\r\n    the former that as gold was not probably existent in nature in\r\n    any but its metallic form, therefore it had been deposited in\r\n    its siliceous matrix while in a molten state, and many ingenious\r\n    arguments were adduced in support of this contention. Of late,\r\n    however, most scientific men, and indeed many purely empirical\r\n    inquirers (using the word empirical in its strict sense) have\r\n    come to the conclusion that though the mode in which they were\r\n    composed was not always identical, all lodes, including\r\n    auriferous formations, were primarily derived from\r\n    mineral-impregnated waters which deposited their contents in\r\n    fissures caused either by the cooling of the earth’s crust or by\r\n    volcanic agency.\r\n\r\n    “The subject is one which has long had a special attraction for\r\n    the writer, who has published several articles thereon, wherein\r\n    it was contended that not only was gold deposited in the lodes\r\n    from aqueous solution, but that some gold found in form of\r\n    nuggets had not been derived from lodes but was nascent in its\r\n    alluvial bed; and for this proof was afforded by the fact that\r\n    certain nuggets have been unearthed having the shape of an\r\n    adjacent pebble or angular fragment of stone indented in them.\r\n    Moreover, no true nugget of any great size has ever been found\r\n    in a lode such as the Welcome, 2159 oz., or the Welcome\r\n    Stranger, 2280 oz.; while it was accidentally discovered some\r\n    years ago that gold could be induced to deposit itself from its\r\n    mineral salt to the metallic state on any suitable base, such as\r\n    iron sulphide.\r\n\r\n    “Following out this fact, I have experimented with various salts\r\n    of gold, and have obtained some very remarkable results. I have\r\n    found it practicable to produce most natural looking specimens\r\n    of auriferous quartz from stone which previously, as proved by\r\n    assay, contained no gold whatever. Moreover, the gold, which\r\n    penetrates the stone in a thorough manner, assumes some of the\r\n    more natural forms. It is always more or less mammillary, but at\r\n    times, owing to causes which I have not yet quite satisfied\r\n    myself upon, is decidedly dendroidal, as may be seen in one of\r\n    the specimens which I have submitted to members. Moreover, I\r\n    find it possible to moderate the colour and to produce a\r\n    specimen in which the gold shall be as ruddy yellow as in the\r\n    ferro-oxide gangue of Mount Morgan, or to tone it to the pale\r\n    primrose hue of the product of the Croydon mines.\r\n\r\n    “I note that the action of the bath in which the stone is\r\n    treated has a particularly disintegrating effect on many of the\r\n    specimens. Some, which before immersion were of a particularly\r\n    flinty texture, became in a few weeks so friable that they could\r\n    be broken up by the fingers. So far as my experiments have\r\n    extended they have proved this, that it was not essential that\r\n    the silica and gold should have been deposited at the one time\r\n    in auriferous lodes. A non-auriferous siliceous solution may\r\n    have filled a fissure, and, after solidifying, some volcanic\r\n    disturbance may have forced water impregnated with a gold salt\r\n    through the interstices of the lode formation, when, if the\r\n    conditions were favourable, the gold would be deposited in\r\n    metallic forms. I prefer, for reasons which will probably be\r\n    understood, not to say exactly by what process my results are\r\n    obtained, but submit specimens for examination.\r\n\r\n    “(1) Piece of previously non-gold bearing stone. Locality near\r\n    Adelaide, now showing gold freely in mammillary and dendroidal\r\n    form.\r\n\r\n    “(2) Stone from New South Wales, showing gold artificially\r\n    introduced in interstices and on face.\r\n\r\n    “(3) Stone from West Australia, very glassy looking, now\r\n    thoroughly impregnated with gold; the mammillary formation\r\n    being particularly noticeable.\r\n\r\n    “(4) Somewhat laminated quartz from Victoria, containing a\r\n    little antimony sulphide. In this specimen the gold not only\r\n    shows on the surface but penetrates each of the laminations, as\r\n    is proved by breaking.\r\n\r\n    “(5) Consists of fragments of crystallised carbonate of lime\r\n    from Tarrawingee, in which the gold is deposited in spots, in\r\n    appearance like ferrous oxide, until submitted to the magnifying\r\n    glass.\r\n\r\n    “The whole subject is worthy of much more time than I can\r\n    possibly give it. The importance lies in this: That having found\r\n    how the much desired metal may have been deposited in its\r\n    matrix, the knowledge should help to suggest how it may be\r\n    economically extracted therefrom.”\r\n\r\nA very remarkable nugget weighing 16¾ oz. was sluiced from near the\r\nsurface in one of my own mining properties at Woodside, South Australia,\r\nsome years ago, which illustrated the nuclear theory very beautifully.\r\nThis nugget is very irregular in shape, fretted and chased as though\r\nwith a jeweller’s graving tool, showing plainly the shape of the\r\npyritous crystals on which it was formed while the interstices were\r\nfilled with red hematite iron just as found in artificially formed\r\nnuggets on a sulphide of iron base. The author has a nugget from the\r\nsame locality weighing about 1½ oz. which exhibits in a marked degree\r\nthe same characteristics, as indeed does most of the alluvial gold found\r\nin the Mount Lofty Ranges; also a nugget from near the centre of\r\nAustralia weighing four ounces, in which the original crystals of\r\npyrites are reproduced in gold just as an iron horse-shoe, placed in a\r\nlaunder through which cupriferously impregnated water flows, will in\r\ntime be changed to nearly pure copper and yet retain its shape.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to the points I have put (p. 36) as to the apparent\r\nanomalies of occurrence of alluvial gold. The explanation for alluvial\r\ngold being of finer quality as a rule than reef is probably that while\r\ngold and silver, which have a considerable affinity for each other, were\r\npresumably dissolved from their salts and held in solution in the same\r\nmineral water, they would in many cases not be deposited together, for\r\nthe reason that silver is most readily deposited in the presence of\r\nalkalies, which would be found in excess in mineral waters coming direct\r\nfrom the basic rocks, while gold is induced to precipitate more quickly\r\nin acid solutions, which would be the character of the waters after they\r\nhad been exposed to atmospheric action and to contact with organic\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThis, then, may explain not only the comparatively greater purity of the\r\nalluvial gold, but also why big nuggets are found so far from auriferous\r\nreefs, and also why heavy masses of gold have been frequently unearthed\r\nfrom among the roots even of living trees, but more particularly in\r\ndrifts containing organic matter, such as ancient timber.\r\n\r\nAll, then, that has been adduced goes to establish the belief that the\r\nbirthplace of our gold is in certain of the earlier rocks comprising the\r\nearth’s crust, and that its appearance as the metal that is valued so\r\nhighly is the result of electro-chemical action, such as we can\r\ndemonstrate in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    GOLD EXTRACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to a highly important part of our subject, the practical\r\ntreatment of ores and matrixes for the extraction of the metals\r\ncontained. The methods employed are multitudinous, but may be divided\r\ninto four classes, namely, washing, amalgamating with mercury,\r\nchlorinating, cyaniding and other leaching processes, and smelting. The\r\nfirst is used in alluvial gold and tin workings and in preparing some\r\nsilver, copper, and other ores for smelting, and consists merely in\r\nseparating the heavier metals and minerals from their gangues by their\r\ngreater specific gravity in water. The second includes the trituration\r\nof the gangue and the extraction of its gold or silver by means of\r\nmercury. Chlorinating and leaching generally is a process whereby metals\r\nare first changed by chemical action into their mineral salts, as\r\nchloride of gold, nitrate of silver, sulphate of copper, and being\r\ndissolved in water are afterwards re-deposited in the metallic form by\r\nmeans of well-known reagents.\r\n\r\nIn really successful mining it is in the last degree important that the\r\nmode of extraction of metals in the most scientific manner should be\r\nthoroughly understood, but as a general rule the science of metallurgy\r\nis but very superficially grasped even by those whose special business\r\nit is to treat ore bodies in order to extract their metalliferous\r\ncontents, and whether in quartz crushing mill, lixiviating, or smelting\r\nworks there is much left to be desired in the method of treating our\r\nores.\r\n\r\nMy attention was recently attracted to an article written by Mr. F. A.\r\nH. Rauft, M.E., from which I make the following extract:\r\n\r\n    He says, speaking of the German treatment of ores and the mode\r\n    of procedure in Australia, “It is high time that Government stepped\r\n    in and endeavoured by prompt and decisive action to bring the mining\r\n    industry upon a sound and legitimate basis. Though our ranges abound\r\n    in all kinds of minerals that might give employment to hundreds of\r\n    thousands of people, mining is carried on in a desultory, haphazard\r\n    fashion. There is no system, and the treatment of ores is of\r\n    necessity handed over to the tender mercies of men who have not even\r\n    an idea of what an intricate science metallurgy has become in older\r\n    countries. During many years of practical experience I have never\r\n    known a single instance where a lode, on being worked, gave a return\r\n    according to assay, and I have never known any mine where some of\r\n    the precious metals could not be found in the tailings or slag. The\r\n    Germans employ hundreds of men in working for zinc which produces\r\n    some two or three per cent. to the ton; here the same percentage of\r\n    tin could hardly be made payable, and this, mark you, is owing not\r\n    to cheaper labour alone, but chiefly to the labour-saving appliances\r\n    and the results of the researches of such gigantic intellects\r\n    as Professor Kerl and many others, of whom we in this country\r\n    never even hear. Go into any of the great mining works of central\r\n    Germany, and you may see acres covered by machinery ingeniously\r\n    constructed to clean, break, and sort, and ultimately deliver the\r\n    ores into trucks or direct into the furnace, and the whole under the\r\n    supervision of a youngster or two. When a parcel of ore arrives at\r\n    any of the works, say Freiberg or Clausthal, it is carefully assayed\r\n    by three or four different persons and then handed over to practical\r\n    experts, who are expected to produce the full amount of precious\r\n    metal according to assay; and if by any chance they do not, a fixed\r\n    percentage of the loss is deducted from their salary; or, if the\r\n    result is in excess of this assay which is more frequently the case,\r\n    a small bonus is added to their pay. Compare this system with our\r\n    own wasteful, reckless method of dealing with our precious metals,\r\n    and we may hide our heads in very shame.”\r\n\r\nAll really practical men will, I think, endorse Mr. Rauft’s opinion.\r\nWell organised and conducted schools of mines will gradually ameliorate\r\nthis unsatisfactory state of things, and I hope before long that we\r\nshall have none but qualified certificated men in our mines. In the\r\nmeantime a few practical hints, particularly on that very difficult\r\nbranch of the subject, the saving of gold, will, it is hoped, be found\r\nof service.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of gold from the soil is an industry so old that its\r\nfirst introduction is lost in the mist of ages. As before stated, gold\r\nis one of the most widely disseminated of the metals, and man, so soon\r\nas he had risen from the lowest forms of savagery, began to be attracted\r\nby the kingly metal, which he found to be easily fashioned into articles\r\nof ornament and use, and to be practically non-corrodable.\r\n\r\nWhat we now term the dish or pan, then, doubtless generally a wooden\r\nbowl, was the appliance first used; but they had also an arrangement,\r\nsomewhat like our modern blanket tables, over which the auriferous sand\r\nwas passed by means of a stream of water. The sands of some of the\r\nrivers from which portions of the gold supply of the old world was\r\nderived are still washed over year after year in exactly the same\r\nmanner as was employed, probably, thousands of years ago, the labour,\r\nvery arduous, being often carried on by women, who, standing knee\r\ndeep in water, pan off the sand in wooden bowls much as the digger in\r\nmodern alluvial fields does with his tin dish. The resulting gold often\r\nconsists of but a grain or two of fine gold-dust, which is carefully\r\ncollected in quills, and so exported or traded for goods.\r\n\r\nThe digger of to-day having discovered payable alluvial dirt at such a\r\ndepth as to permit of its being profitably worked by small parties of\r\nmen with limited or no capital, procures first a half hogshead for a\r\npuddling tub, a “cradle,” or “long tom,” and tin dish. The “wash dirt,”\r\nas the auriferous drift is usually termed, contains a considerable\r\nadmixture of clay of a more or less tenacious character, and the bulk of\r\nthis has to be puddled and so disintegrated before the actual separation\r\nof the gold is attempted in the cradle or dish. This is done in the tub\r\nby constantly stirring with a shovel, and changing the water as it\r\nbecomes charged with the floating argillaceous, or clayey, particles.\r\nThe gravel is then placed in the hopper of the cradle which separates\r\nthe larger stones and pebbles, the remainder passing down over inclined\r\nledges as the cradle is slowly rocked and supplied with water. At the\r\nbottom of each ledge is a riffle to arrest the particles of gold.\r\nSometimes, when the gold is very fine, amalgamated copper plates are\r\nintroduced and the lower ledges are covered with green baize to act as\r\nblanket tables and catch gold which might otherwise be lost.\r\n\r\nA long tom (Fig. 8) is a trough some 12 feet in length by 20 inches in\r\nwidth at the upper end, widening to 30 inches at the lower end; it is\r\nabout 9 inches deep and has a fall of 1 inch to a foot. An iron screen\r\nis placed at the lower end (cut off in the manner shown in diagram)\r\nwhere large stones are caught, and below this screen is the riffle box,\r\n12 feet long, 3 feet wide, and having the same inclination as the upper\r\ntrough. It is fitted with several riffles in which mercury is sometimes\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 8. LONG TOM.]\r\n\r\nMuch more work can be done with this appliance than with the cradle,\r\nwhich it superseded. Of course, the gold must be coarse and water\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the claim is paying, and the diggings show signs of some\r\npermanency, a puddling machine is constructed. This is described and\r\nillustrated in Chapter XII., called “Rules of Thumb.”\r\n\r\nHydraulicing and ground sluicing is a very cheap and effective method of\r\ntreating large quantities of auriferous drift, and, given favourable\r\ncircumstances, such as a plentiful supply of water with good fall and\r\nextensive loose auriferous deposits, a very few grains to the ton or\r\nload can be made to give payable returns.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 9. FLUME, GREAT SOUTHERN GOLD-FIELD,\r\n    SHOALHAVEN, N.S.W.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 10. MONITOR AT WORK, GREAT SOUTHERN\r\n    GOLD-FIELD.]\r\n\r\nThe water is conveyed in flumes (Fig. 9), or pipes to a point near\r\nwhere it is required, thence in wrought iron pipes gradually reduced\r\nin size and ending in a great nozzle somewhat like that of a fireman’s\r\nhose. The “Monitor,” as it is sometimes called, is generally fixed on a\r\nmovable stand, so arranged that the strong jet of water can be directed\r\nto any point by a simple adjustment (Fig. 10). A “face” is formed in\r\nthe drift, and the water played against the lower portion of the ledge,\r\nwhich is quickly undermined, falls, and is soon washed away in the\r\nstream of water, which is conducted through sluices with riffles, and\r\nsometimes over considerable lengths of amalgamated copper plates. This\r\nclass of mining has been most extensively carried out in California and\r\nNew Zealand, and some districts of Victoria, but the truly enormous\r\ndrifts of the Shoalhaven district in New South Wales must in the\r\nnear future add largely to the world’s gold supply. These drifts are\r\nauriferous from grass roots to bed rock, extend for nearly fifty miles,\r\nand are in places as much as 300 feet deep. Want of capital and want of\r\nknowledge has hitherto prevented them being profitably worked on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of reef gold from its matrix is a much more complicated\r\nprocess, and the problem how most effectively to obtain that great\r\ndesideratum--a complete separating and saving operation--is one which\r\ntaxes the skill and evokes the ingenuity of scientific men all over the\r\nworld. The difficulty is that as scarcely any two gangues, or matrixes,\r\nare exactly alike, the treatment which is found most effective on one\r\nmine will often not answer in another. Much also depends on the\r\nproportion of gold to the ton of rock under treatment, as the most\r\nscientific and perfect processes of lixiviation hitherto adopted will\r\nnot pay, even when all other conditions are favourable, if the amount of\r\ngold is much under half an ounce to the ton and even then will leave but\r\na very small profit. If, however, the gold is “free,” and the lode\r\nlarge, a very few pennyweights (or “dollars,” as the Americans say) to\r\nthe ton will pay handsomely. The mode of extraction longest in vogue,\r\nand after all the cheapest and most effective, for free milling ores\r\nwhere the gold is not too fine, is amalgamation with mercury, which\r\nmetal has a strong affinity for gold, silver, and copper.\r\n\r\nAs to crushing appliances, I shall not say much. “Their name is legion\r\nfor they are many,” and the same may be said of concentrators. It may be\r\nold-fashioned, but I admit my predilection is still in favour of the\r\nstamper-battery, for the reason that though it may be slower in\r\nproportion to the power employed, it is simple and not liable to get\r\nout of order, a great advantage when one has so often to depend on men\r\nwho bring to their work a supply principally of main strength and\r\nstupidity. For the same reason I prefer the old draw and lift, and\r\nplunger pumps to newer but more complicated water-lifters.\r\n\r\nOn both these points, however, I am constrained to admit that my opinion\r\nhas recently been somewhat shaken.\r\n\r\nI have lately seen two appliances which appear to mark a new era in the\r\nscientific progress of mining. One is the “Griffin Mill,” the other the\r\n“Lemichel Siphon Élévateur.”\r\n\r\nThe first is in some respects on the principle of the Huntingdon Mill.\r\nThe latter, if the inventor is to be believed, and the results seem to\r\nshow he may, will be a wonderful factor in developing not only mining\r\nproperties where a preponderance of water is the trouble, but also in\r\nproviding an automatic, and therefore extremely cheap, mode of\r\nwater-raising and supply, which in simplicity is thus far unexampled.\r\nAtmospheric pressure alone is relied on. The well-known process of the\r\nsyphon is the basis, but with this essential difference, that a large\r\nproportion of the water drawn up to the apex of the syphon is\r\nsuper-elevated to heights regulated by the fall obtained in the outlet\r\nleg. This elevation can be repeated almost indefinitely by returning the\r\nwaste water to the reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThe Lemichel Syphon (Fig. 11) is a wonderful, yet most simple\r\napplication of natural force. The inlet leg of the syphon is larger in\r\ndiameter than the outlet leg, and is provided at the bottom with a valve\r\nor “clack.” The outlet leg has a tap at its base. At the apex are two\r\nchambers, with an intermediary valve, regulated by a counterpoise\r\nweighted lever. The first chamber has also a vertical valve and pipe.\r\n\r\nWhen the tap of the outlet leg is turned, the water flows as in an\r\nordinary syphon, but owing to the rapid automatic opening and shutting\r\nof the valve in the first chamber about 45 per cent. of the water is\r\ndiverted, and may be raised to a height of many feet above the top of\r\nthe syphon.\r\n\r\nIt need not be impressed on practical men that if this invention will\r\nperform anything like what is claimed for it, its value can hardly be\r\ncalculated. After a careful inspection of the appliance in operation, I\r\nbelieve it will do all that is stated.\r\n\r\nAnother invention is combined with this which, by a very small\r\nexpenditure of fuel, will enable the first point of atmospheric pressure\r\nto be attained. In this way the unwatering of mines may be very\r\ninexpensively effected, or water for irrigation purposes may be raised\r\nfrom an almost level stream (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 11. “LEMICHEL” SYPHON.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 12. “GRIFFIN” MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe Griffin Mill is a centrifugal motion crusher with one roller only,\r\nwhich, by an ingenious application of motive force, revolves in an\r\nopposite direction to its initial momentum, and which evolves a force of\r\n6000 lb. against the tire, which is only 30 inches in diameter. For hard\r\nquartz the size should be increased by at least 6 inches. It is claimed\r\nfor this mill that it will pulverise to a gauge of 900 holes to the\r\nsquare inch from 1½ to 2½ tons per hour, or, say roughly, 150 tons\r\nper week.\r\n\r\nThe Huntingdon mill (Fig. 13) is a good crusher and amalgamator where\r\nthe material to be operated on is comparatively soft, but does not do\r\nsuch good work when the stone is of a hard flinty nature.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 13. HUNTINGDON MILL.]\r\n\r\nA No. 4 Dodge stone-breaker working about 8 hours will keep a five foot\r\nHuntingdon Mill going 24 hours, and an automatic feeder is necessary.\r\nFor that matter both are almost essential for an ordinary stamper\r\nbattery, and will certainly increase the crushing capacity and do better\r\nwork from the greater regularity of the feed.\r\n\r\nA 10 h.-p. (nominal) engine of good type is sufficient for Huntingdon\r\nmill, rock breaker, self-feeder and steam pump. A five foot mill under\r\nfavourable circumstances will crush about as much as eight head of\r\nmedium weight stamps.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 14. STONE-BREAKER.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 15. STONE-BREAKER (SECTIONAL VIEW).]\r\n\r\nThe Grusonwerk Ball Mills (Fig. 16), made by Krupp of Germany, as also\r\nthat made by the Austral Otis Company, Melbourne, are fast and excellent\r\ntriturating appliances for either wet or dry working, but are specially\r\nsuitable only for ores when the gold is fine and evenly distributed\r\nin the stone. The trituration is effected by revolving the stone in a\r\nlarge cylinder together with a number of steel balls of various sizes,\r\nthe attrition of which with the rock quickly grinds it to powder of any\r\nrequired degree of fineness.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 16. GRUSONWERK BALL MILL.]\r\n\r\nProbably more mines have been ruined by bad mill management than by bad\r\nmining, though every experienced man must have seen in his time many\r\nmost flagrant instances of bungling in the latter respect. Shafts are\r\noften sunk on the wrong side of the lode or too near or too far away\r\ntherefrom, while instances have not been wanting where the (mis)manager\r\nhas, after sinking his shaft, driven in the opposite direction to that\r\nwhere the lode should be found.\r\n\r\nA common error is that of erecting machinery before there is sufficient\r\nore in sight to make it certain that enough can be provided to keep the\r\nplant going. In mines at a distance from the centre of management it is\r\nalmost impossible to check mistakes of this description, caused by the\r\nignorance or over sanguineness of the mine superintendent, and they are\r\noften as disastrous as they are indefensible. Another fertile source of\r\nfailure is the craze for experimenting with untried inventions, alleged\r\nto be improvements on well-known methods.\r\n\r\nA rule in the most scientific of card games, whist, is “when in doubt\r\nlead trumps.” It might be paraphrased for mining thus: “When in doubt\r\nabout machinery use that which has been proved.” Let some one else do\r\nthe experimenting.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 17. DOUBLE FAULTED LODE.]\r\n\r\nThe success of a quartz mine depends as much on favourable working\r\nconditions as on its richness in gold. Thus it may be that a mine\r\ncarrying 5 or 6 oz. of gold to the ton but badly circumstanced as to\r\ndistance, mountainous roads, lack of wood and water, in some cases a\r\nplethora of the latter, or irregularly faulted country (Fig. 17), may\r\nbe less profitable than another showing only 5 or 6 dwt., but favourably\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nIt is usually desirable to choose for the battery site, when possible,\r\nthe slope of a hill which consists of rock that will give a good\r\nfoundation for your battery.\r\n\r\nThe economical working depends greatly on the situation, which is\r\ngenerally fixed more or less, in the proximity of the water. The\r\nadvantages of having ample water for battery purposes, or of using water\r\nas a motive power, are so great that it is very often desirable to\r\nconstruct a tramway of considerable length, when, by so doing, that\r\npower can be utilised; hence most quartz mills are placed near streams,\r\nor in valleys where catchment dams can be effectively constructed,\r\nexcept, of course, in districts where much water has to be pumped from\r\nthe mine.\r\n\r\nIf water-power can be used, the water-motor will necessarily be placed\r\nas low as possible, in order to obtain the fullest available power. One\r\npoint is essential. Special care must be taken to keep the appliances\r\nabove highest flood-level. If the water in the stream is not sufficient\r\nto carry off the tailings, the battery should be placed at such a height\r\nas to leave sufficient slope for tailings’ dumps. This is more important\r\nwhen treating ore of such value that the tailings are worth saving for\r\nsecondary treatment. In this case provision should be made for tailings,\r\ndams, or slime pits.\r\n\r\nWhether the battery is worked by water, steam, or gas power, an ample\r\nsupply of water is absolutely necessary, at least until some thoroughly\r\neffective mode of dry treatment is established. If it can be possibly\r\narranged the water should be brought in by gravitation, and first cost\r\nis often least cost; but where this is impossible, pumps of sufficient\r\ncapacity, not only to provide the absolute quantity used, but to meet\r\nany emergency, should be erected.\r\n\r\nThe purer the water the better it will be for amalgamating purposes, and\r\nin cold climates it is desirable to make provision for heating the water\r\nsupplied to the battery. This can be done by means of steam from the\r\nboiler led through the feed tanks; but where the boiler power is not\r\nmore than required, waste steam from the engine may be employed, but\r\ncare must be taken that no greasy matter comes in contact with the\r\nplates. The exhaust steam from the engine may be utilised by carrying it\r\nthrough tubes fitted in an ordinary 400 gallon tank.\r\n\r\nReducing appliances have often to be placed in districts where the water\r\nsupply is insufficient for the battery. When this is so every available\r\nmeans must be adopted for saving the precious liquid, such as condensing\r\nthe exhaust steam from the engine. This may be done by conducting it\r\nthrough a considerable length of ordinary zinc piping, such as is used\r\nfor carrying the water from house roofs. Also tailings pits should be\r\nmade, in which the tailings and slimes are allowed to settle, and the\r\ncleared water is pumped back to be again used. These pits should, where\r\npracticable, be cemented. It is usual, also, to have one or two tailings\r\ndams at different levels; the tailings are run into the upper dam, and\r\nare allowed to settle; the slimes overflow from it into the lower dam,\r\nand are there deposited, while the cleared water is pumped back to the\r\nbattery. Arrangements are made by which all these reservoirs can be\r\nsluiced out when they are filled with accumulated tailings. It is well\r\nnot to leave the sluicing for too long a period, as when the slimes and\r\ntailings are set hard they are difficult to remove.\r\n\r\nWhere a permanent reducing plant is to be erected, whatever form of mill\r\nmay be adopted, it is better for many reasons to use automatic ore\r\nfeeders. Of these the best two I have met are the “Tulloch” (Fig. 18),\r\nand “Challenge” (Fig. 19) either of which can be adapted to any mill and\r\nboth do good work.\r\n\r\nBy their use the reducing capacity of the mill is increased, and the\r\nfeeding being regular the wear and tear is decreased, while by the\r\nregulated feeding of the “pulp” in the battery box or mortar can be\r\nmaintained at any degree of consistency which may be found desirable,\r\nand thus the process of amalgamation will be greatly facilitated. The\r\nonly objection which can be urged against the automatic feeder is that\r\nthe steel points of picks, gads, drills, and other tools may be allowed\r\nto pass into the mortar or mill, and thus cause considerable wear and\r\ntear. A remedy for this is suggested (p. 148).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE IV.--TAIL RACE _To face p._ 74]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 18. TULLOCH AUTOMATIC ORE FEEDER.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 19. CHALLENGE AUTOMATIC ORE FEEDER.]\r\n\r\nIf local conditions are favourable and the management good, some mines\r\nhave paid well with a yield of from 1½ to 4 dwts. of gold per ton of\r\nore; but others have not paid with much higher yields in test crushings.\r\nGreat judgment is required in selecting the best possible site for the\r\nclass of crushing machinery decided upon. The crusher should be as high\r\nas can be managed so as to give a good clear run for the tailings and\r\nroom for the concentrators and amalgamators, &c., below the copper\r\nplates and blanket strakes. Solid, strong foundations are essential;\r\nmany failures are due to a neglect of this point.\r\n\r\nIn a stamp mill (Fig. 20) the foundations are usually made of hard-wood\r\nlogs about 5 to 6 feet long, set on end, the bottom end resting on rock\r\nand set round with cement concrete. These are bolted together, and the\r\n“box” or mortar is bolted to them. The horizontal logs to carry the\r\n“horses” or supports for the battery frame should also be of good size,\r\nand solidly and securely bolted. The same applies to your engine bed,\r\nbut whether it be of timber, or mason work, above all things provide\r\nthat the whole of your work is set out square and true to save after\r\nwear and friction. Fig. 21 represents a 10-head stamp mill.\r\n\r\nMy experience has been that the most effective weight for stamps and\r\nheight for drop largely depends on the nature of the rock foundation. I\r\nhave usually found that with medium stamps, say 7½ to 8 cwt. with\r\nfair drop and lively action, about 80 falls per minute, the best results\r\nwere obtained, but the tendency of modern mill men is towards the\r\nheavier stamps, 10 cwt. and even heavier.\r\n\r\nGreat improvements have been made in stamp mills since the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as is evident by comparing Fig. 21A with Figs. 20 and 21; even\r\nin the writer’s time they have been considerable.\r\n\r\nTo find the horse power required to drive a battery, multiply the weight\r\nof one stamp by the number of stamps in the battery; the height of lift\r\nin feet by the number of lifts per minute; add one-third of the product\r\nfor friction, and the result will be the number of feet-lbs. per minute;\r\ndivide this by 33,000 which is the number of feet-lbs. per minute equal\r\nto 1 h.-p. and the result will be the h.-p. required. Thus if a stamp\r\nweighs 800 lbs. and you have five in the box, and each stamp has a\r\nlift of 9 in. = 0·75 ft. and strikes 80 blows per minute, then ÷ 800\r\n× 5 × 0·75 × 80 = 240,000; one third of 240,000 = 80,000, which added\r\nto 240,000 = 320,000; and 320,000 divided by 33,000 = 9·7 h.-p. or 1·9\r\nh.-p. each stamp.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 20. STAMP MILL, SHOWING PART OF FOUNDATIONS.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 21. 10-HEAD STAMP MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe total weight of a battery, including stamper box, stampers, &c, may\r\nbe roughly estimated at about 1 ton per stamp. Medium weight stampers,\r\nincluding shank, cam, disc, head, and shoe, weigh from 600-700 lbs., and\r\nneed about 3/4 h.-p. to work them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 21A. SIXTEENTH CENTURY STAMP MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water required for the effective treatment of gold\r\nbearing rock in a stamper battery varies according to the composition of\r\nthe material to be operated upon, but generally it is more than the\r\ninexperienced believe. For instance, “mullocky” lode stuff, containing\r\nmuch clayey matter or material carrying a large percentage of heavy\r\nmetal, such as titanic iron or metallic sulphides, will need a larger\r\nquantity of water per stamp than clean quartz. A fair average quantity\r\nwould be 750 to 1000 gallons per hour for each box of five stamps. In\r\ngeneral practice I have seldom found 1000 gallons per hour more than\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nAs to the most effective mesh for the screen or grating, that depends\r\nlargely on the size of the gold particles contained in the gangue. The\r\nfiner the particles the closer must be the mesh, so that nothing but\r\ncareful experiment will enable the battery manager to decide this most\r\nimportant point. The American slotted screens are best; they wear better\r\nthan the punched gratings and can be used of finer gauge. Woven steel\r\nwire gauze is employed with good effect in some mills where specially\r\nfine trituration is required. This class of screen requires special care\r\nas it is somewhat fragile, but with intelligent treatment does good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe fall or inclination of the tables, both copper and blanket strakes,\r\nis also regulated by the class of ore. If it should be heavy then the\r\nfall must be steeper. A fair average drop is 3/4 inch to the foot. Be\r\ncareful that your copper tables are thoroughly water-tight, for,\r\nremember, where water will percolate, mercury will penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe blanket tables are simply a continuation of the mercury tables, but\r\ncovered with strips of coarse blanket, green baize, or other flocculent\r\nmaterial, intended to arrest the heavier metallic particles which have\r\nnot been amalgamated.\r\n\r\nThe blanket table is, however, a very unsatisfactory concentrator at\r\nbest, and is giving place to mechanical concentrators of various\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nI have a device at present unpatented which will do away with the\r\nnecessity for blanket tables or copper plates, as by the expenditure of\r\nfrom 1/2 to 1 h.-p. every particle of free gold after leaving the boxes\r\nmust come within the embrace of a mercury amalgam. No cleaning of plates\r\nis required.\r\n\r\nAn ancient Egyptian gold washing table is shown in Fig. 22. It is a\r\nrepresentation of an old stone table such as is referred to in p. 2,\r\nwhich was used by the Egyptians in treating the gold ores of Lower\r\nEgypt. The ore was first ground, it is likely by means of some\r\ndescription of stone arrastra, and then passed over the sloping table\r\nwith water, the gold being retained in the riffles. In these the\r\nmaterial would probably be mechanically agitated. Although for its era\r\ningenious it will be plain to practical men that if the gold were fine\r\nthe process would be very ineffective. Possibly, but of this I have no\r\nevidence, mercury was used to retain the gold in the riffles, for, as\r\npreviously stated, this method was known to the ancients.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG 22. WASHING TABLE OF STONE WITH RIFFLES.]\r\n\r\nAt a mine at which I was managing director the lode was almost entirely\r\ncomposed of sulphide of iron, carbonate of lime or calcspar, with a\r\nlittle silica. In this case it was found best to crush without mercury,\r\nthen run the pulp into pans, where it was concentrated. The concentrates\r\nwere calcined in a common reverberatory furnace, and afterwards\r\namalgamated with mercury in a special pan; the results were very\r\nsatisfactory; but it does not follow that this process would be the most\r\nsuitable for a slightly different lode stuff.\r\n\r\nI was lately consulted with respect to the treatment of a pyritic ore in\r\na very promising mine, but could not recommend the above treatment,\r\nbecause though the pyrites in the gangue was similar, the bulk of the\r\nlode consisted of silica, consequently there would be a great waste of\r\npower in triturating the whole of the stuff to what, with regard to much\r\nof it, would be an unnecessary degree of fineness. I am of opinion that\r\nin cases such as this, where it is not intended to adopt the\r\nchlorination or cyanogen process, it will be found most economical to\r\ncrush to a coarse gauge, concentrate, calcine the concentrates, and\r\nfinally amalgamate in some suitable amalgamator.\r\n\r\nProbably for this mode of treatment Krom rolls would be found more\r\neffective reducing agents than stampers, as with them the bulk of the\r\nore can be broken to any required gauge and there would consequently be\r\nless loss in “slimes.”\r\n\r\nThe great art in effective battery work is to crush your stuff to the\r\nrequired fineness only, and then to provide that each particle is\r\nbrought into contact with the mercury either in box, trough plate, or\r\npan. To do this the flow of water must be carefully regulated; it should\r\nnot carry the stuff off too quickly nor allow the troughs and plates to\r\nbe choked. In cold weather the water may be warmed by passing the\r\nfeed-pipe through a tank into which the steam from the engine exhausts,\r\nand this will be found to keep the mercury bright and lively. But be\r\ncareful no engine oil or grease mingles with the water, as grease on the\r\ncopper tables will absolutely prevent amalgamation.\r\n\r\nThe first point, then, is to effectively crush the gangue, the degree of\r\nfineness being regulated by the fineness of the gold itself. This being\r\ndone, then comes the question of saving the gold. If the quartz be\r\nclean, and the gold unmixed with base metal, the difficulty is small.\r\nAll that is required is to ensure that each particle of gold shall be\r\ntaken up by the mercury. The main object is to arrest the gold at the\r\nearliest possible stage; therefore, if you are treating clean stone\r\ncontaining free gold, either coarse or fine, I advise the use of mercury\r\nin the boxes, for the reason that a considerable proportion of the gold\r\nwill be caught thereby, and settling to the bottom, or adhering to\r\namalgamated plates in the boxes, where such are used, will not be\r\nafterwards affected by the crushing action, which might otherwise break\r\nup, or “flour,” the mercury. On the whole, I rather favour the use of\r\nmercury in the box at any time, unless the ore is very refractory--that\r\nis, contains too great a proportion of base metals, particularly\r\nsulphides of iron, arsenic, &c., when the result will not be\r\nsatisfactory, but may entail great loss by the escape of floured mercury\r\ncarrying with it particles of gold. Intelligent experience will assist\r\nthe battery manager to adopt the right system.\r\n\r\nThe crushed stuff--generally termed the “pulp”--passes from the boxes\r\nthrough the “screens” or “gratings,” and so on to the “tables”--_i.e._,\r\nsheets of copper amalgamated on the upper surface with mercury, and\r\nsometimes electroplated with silver and afterwards treated with mercury.\r\nUnless the quartz is very clean, and, consequently light, I am opposed\r\nto the form of stamper box with mercury troughs cast in the “lip,” nor\r\ndo I think that a trough under the lip is a good arrangement, as it\r\nusually gets so choked and covered with the heavy clinging base metals\r\nas to make it almost impossible for the gold to come in contact with the\r\nmercury. It will be found better where the gold is fine, or the gangue\r\ncontains much base metal, to run the pulp from the lip of the battery\r\ninto a “distributor.”\r\n\r\nThe distributor is a wooden box the full width of the stamper box or\r\nmortar, having a perforated iron bottom set some three to four inches\r\nabove the first copper plate, which should come up under the lip. The\r\neffect of this arrangement is that the pulp is dashed on to the plate by\r\nthe falling water, and the gold at once coming in contact with the\r\nmercury begins to accumulate and attract that which follows, till the\r\namalgam becomes piled in little crater-shaped mounds, and thus 75 per\r\ncent. of the gold is saved on the top plate.\r\n\r\nI have tried a further adaptation of this process when treating ores\r\ncontaining a large percentage of iron oxide, where the bulk of the gold\r\nis impalpably fine, and contained in the “gossan.” At the end of the\r\nblanket table, or at any point where the crushed stuff last passes\r\nbefore going to the “tailings heap” or “sludge pit,” a “saver” is\r\nplaced. The saver is a strong box about 15 in. square by 3 ft. high, one\r\nside of which is removable, but must fit tight. Nine slots are cut\r\ninside at 4 in. apart, and into these are fitted nine square perforated\r\ncopper plates, having about eighty to a hundred 1/4 in. holes in each;\r\nthe perforations should not come opposite each other. These plates are\r\nto be amalgamated on both sides with mercury, and the top plate “fed”\r\nfrom time to time with mercury, in which a very little sodium has been\r\nplaced. If acid ores are being treated, zinc should be employed in place\r\nof sodium, and to prevent the plates becoming bare, if the stuff is very\r\npoor, thick zinc amalgam may be used with good effect; but in that case\r\ndiscontinue the sodium, and occasionally, if required, say once or twice\r\nin the day, mix an ounce of sulphuric acid in a half gallon of water and\r\nslowly pour it into the launder above the saver. Underneath the “saver”\r\nyou require a few riffles, or troughs, to catch any waste mercury, but\r\nif not overfed there should be no waste. This automatic appliance\r\nsometimes arrests a considerable quantity of gold.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the subsidiary processes of battery work, the “cleaning”\r\nof plates, and “scaling” same when it is desired to get all the gold off\r\nthem, the cleaning and retorting of amalgam, and of the mercury,\r\nsmelting gold, &c.\r\n\r\nPlates should be tenderly treated, kept as smooth as possible, and when\r\ncleaning up after crushing, in your own battery, the amalgam--except,\r\nsay, at half-yearly intervals--should be removed with a rubber only; the\r\nrubber is simply a square of black india-rubber or soft pine wood.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 23. SCRAPER.]\r\n\r\nWhen crushing rich ore, and you want to get nearly all the gold off your\r\nplates, the scraper (Fig. 23) may be resorted to. This is usually made\r\nby the mine blacksmith from an old flat file which is cut in half, the\r\ntop turned over, beaten out to a sharp blade, and kept sharp by touching\r\nit up on the grinding-stone. This, if carefully used, will remove the\r\nbulk of the amalgam without injury to the plate.\r\n\r\nVarious methods of “scaling” plates will be found among “Rules of\r\nThumb.”\r\n\r\nWhere base metals are present in the lode stuff frequent retortings of\r\nthe mercury, say not less than once a month, will be found to have a\r\ngood effect in keeping it pure and active. For this purpose, and in\r\norder to prevent stoppage of the machinery, a double quantity is\r\nnecessary, so that half may be used alternately. Less care is required\r\nin retorting the mercury than in treating the amalgam, as the object in\r\nthe one case is more to cleanse the metal of impurities than to save\r\ngold, which will for the most part have been extracted by squeezing\r\nthrough the chamois leather or calico. A good strong heat may therefore\r\nat once be applied to the retort and continued, the effect being to\r\noxidise the arsenic, antimony, lead, &c., which, in the form of oxides,\r\nwill not again amalgamate with the mercury, but will either lie on its\r\nsurface under the water, into which the nozzle of the retort is\r\ninserted, or will float away on the surface of the water. I have also\r\nfound that covering the top of the mercury with a few inches of broken\r\ncharcoal when retorting has an excellent purifying effect.\r\n\r\nIn retorting amalgam, much care and attention is required.\r\n\r\nFirst, never fill the retort too full, give plenty of room for\r\nexpansion; for, when the heat is applied, the amalgam will rise like\r\ndough in an oven, and may be forced into the discharge pipe, the\r\nconsequence being a loss of amalgam or the possible bursting of the\r\nretort. Next, be careful in applying the heat, which should be done\r\ngradually, commencing at the top. This is essential to prevent waste and\r\nto turn out a good-looking cake of gold, which all battery managers like\r\nto do, even if they purpose smelting into bars.\r\n\r\nSometimes special difficulties crop up in the process of separating the\r\ngold from the amalgam. At the first “cleaning up” on the Frasers Mine at\r\nSouthern Cross, West Australia, great consternation was excited by the\r\nappearance of the retorted gold, which, as an old miner graphically put\r\nit, was “as black as the hind leg of a crow,” and utterly unfit for\r\nsmelting, owing to the presence of base metals. Some time after this I\r\nwas largely interested in the Blackborne mine in the same district when\r\na similar trouble arose. This I succeeded in surmounting, but a still\r\nmore serious one was too much for me--_i.e._, the absence of payable\r\ngold in the stone. I give here an extract from the _Australian Mining\r\nStandard_, of December 9th, 1893, with reference to the mode of cleaning\r\nthe amalgam which I adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW METHOD OF SEPARATING GOLD FROM IMPURE AMALGAM.\r\n\r\nI had submitted to me lately a sample of amalgam from a mine in West\r\nAustralia which amalgam had proved a complete puzzle to the manager and\r\namalgamator. The Mint returns showed a very large proportion of\r\nimpurity, even in the smelted gold. When retorted only, the Mint\r\nauthorities refused to take it after they had treated the first two\r\ncakes, one of 119 oz., which yielded only 35 oz. 5 dwt. standard gold,\r\nand one of 140 oz., which gave 41 oz. 10 dwt. The gold smelted on the\r\nmine was nearly as bad proportionately. Thus, 128 oz. smelted down at\r\nthe Mint to 87 oz. 8 dwt. and 109 oz. to 55 oz. 10 dwt. The impurity was\r\nprincipally iron, a most unusual thing in my experience, and was due to\r\ntwo causes revealed by assay of the ore and analysis of the mine water,\r\nviz., an excess of arsenate of iron in the stone, and the presence in\r\nlarge proportions of mineral salts, principally chloride of calcium\r\nCaCl_{2}, sodium NaCl, and magnesium MgCl_{2}, in the mine water used in\r\nthe battery. The exact analysis of the water was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of Iron             FeCO₃            2·76 grains per gallon\r\n  Carbonate of Calcium          CaCO₃            7·61    ”         ”\r\n  Sulphate of Calcium           CaSO₄           81·71    ”         ”\r\n  Chloride of Calcium           CaCl₂         2797·84    ”         ”\r\n  Chloride of Magnesium         MgCl₂          610·13    ”         ”\r\n  Chloride of Sodium or\r\n         Common Salt            NaCl          5072·65    ”         ”\r\n                                             ----------\r\n                   Total solid matter         8572·70 = 19·5 oz. to the\r\n                                                                 gallon.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that this water is nearly four times more salt\r\nthan that of the sea. The effect of using a water of this character, as\r\nI have previously found, is to cause the amalgamation of considerable\r\nquantities of iron with the gold as in this case.\r\n\r\nI received 10 oz. of amalgam, and having found what constituted its\r\nimpurities proceeded to experiment as to its treatment. When retorted on\r\nthe mine it was turned out in a black cake so impure as almost to make\r\nit impossible to smelt properly. I found the same result on first\r\nretorting, and after a number of experiments which need not be\r\nrecapitulated, though some were fairly effective, I hit on the following\r\nmethod, which proved to be most successful and will probably be so found\r\nin other localities where similarly unfavourable conditions prevail.\r\n\r\nI took a small ball of amalgam, placed it in a double fold of new\r\nfine-grained calico, and after soaking in hot water put it under a\r\npowerful press. The weight of the ball before pressing was 1583 gr.\r\nFrom this 383 gr. of mercury were expressed and five-eighths of a grain\r\nof gold was retorted from this expressed mercury. The residue, in the\r\nform of a dark, grey, and very friable cake, was powdered up between the\r\nfingers and retorted, when it became a brown powder; it was afterwards\r\ncalcined on a flat sheet in the open air; result, 510 gr. of\r\nrusset-coloured powder. Smelted with borax, the iron oxide readily\r\nseparated with the slag; result, 311 gr. gold 871-1000 fine; a second\r\nsmelting brought this up to 914-1000 fine. Proportion of smelted gold to\r\namalgam, one-fifth.\r\n\r\nThe principal point about this mode of treatment is the squeezing out of\r\nthe mercury, whereby the amalgam goes into the retort in the form of\r\npowder, thus preventing the slagging of the iron and enclosure of the\r\ngold. The second point of importance is thorough calcining before\r\nsmelting.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be practicable, if desired, to treat the powder with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and thus remove all the iron, but in a large way this\r\nwould be too expensive, and my laboratory treatment, though necessarily\r\non a small scale, was intended to be on a practical basis.\r\n\r\nThe amalgam at this mine was in this way afterwards treated with great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nFor the information of readers who do not understand the\r\nchemical symbols it may be said that\r\n\r\n    FeCO₃ is carbonate of iron;\r\n    CaCO₃ is carbonate of calcium;\r\n    CaSO₄ is sulphate of calcium;\r\n    CaCl₂  is chloride of calcium;\r\n    MgCl₂ is chloride of magnesium;\r\n    NaCl   is chloride of sodium, or common salt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    GOLD EXTRACTION--SECONDARY PROCESSES AND LIXIVIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore any plan is adopted for treating the ore in a new mine the\r\nmanagement should very seriously and carefully consider the whole\r\ncircumstances of the case, taking into account the quantity and quality\r\nof the lode stuff to be operated on, and ascertain by analysis what are\r\nits component parts, for, as before stated, the treatment which will\r\nyield most satisfactory results with a certain class of gangue on one\r\nmine will sometimes, even when the material is apparently similar, prove\r\na disastrous failure in another. Some time since I was glad to note that\r\nthe manager of what has since become a very prominent Australian mine\r\nstrongly discountenanced the purchase of any extracting plant until he\r\nwas fully satisfied as to the character of the bulk of the ore he would\r\nhave to treat. It would be well for the pockets of shareholders and the\r\nreputation of managers if more of our mine superintendents followed this\r\nprudent and sensible course.\r\n\r\nHaving treated on gold extraction with mercury by amalgamated plates and\r\ntheir accessories, something must be said about secondary modes of\r\nsaving in connection with the amalgamation process. The operations\r\ndescribed hitherto have been the disintegration of the gold-bearing\r\nmaterial and the extraction therefrom of the coarser free gold. But it\r\nmust be understood that most auriferous lode stuff contains a proportion\r\nof sulphides of various metals, wherein a part of the gold, usually in a\r\nvery finely divided state, is enclosed, and on this gold the mercury has\r\nno influence. Also many lodes contain hard heavy ferric ores, such as\r\ntitanic iron, tungstate of iron, and hematite, in which gold is held. In\r\nothers, again, are found considerable quantities of soft powdery iron\r\noxide or “gossan,” and compounds such as limonite, aluminous clay, &c.,\r\nwhich, under the action of the crushing mill become finely divided and\r\nfloat off in the water as “slimes,” carrying with them atoms of gold,\r\noften microscopically small. To save the gold in such matrixes as these\r\nis an operation which even the best of our mechanical appliances have\r\nnot yet fully accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhere there is not too great a proportion of base metals on which the\r\nsolvent will act, and when the material is rich enough in gold to pay\r\nfor the extra cost of treatment, chlorination or cyanisation are the\r\nbest modes of extraction yet practically adopted.\r\n\r\nPresuming, however, that we are working by the amalgamation process, and\r\nhave crushed our stone and obtained the free gold, the next requirement\r\nis an effective concentrator to secure the heavy base metals which hold\r\na percentage of gold. There are many, and some do excellent work, but do\r\nnot act equally well in all circumstances. The first and most primitive\r\nis the blanket table (p. 79); but it can hardly be said to be very\r\neffective, and requires constant attention and frequent changing and\r\nwashing of the strips of blanket.\r\n\r\nInstead of blanket tables percussion tables are sometimes used, to which\r\na jerking motion is given against the flow of the water and pulp, and by\r\nthis means the heavier minerals are gathered towards the upper part of\r\nthe table, and are removed when concentrated. I have seen this appliance\r\ndoing fairly good work, but it is by no means a perfect concentrator.\r\n\r\nAnother form of “shaking table” is one with a lateral motion, and this,\r\nwhether with amalgamated plates, or provided with small riffles, or\r\ncovered with blanket, keeps the pulp lively and encourages the retention\r\nof the heavier particles, whether of gold or base metals containing\r\ngold. There has also been devised a rocking table, the action of which\r\nis analogous to that of the ordinary miner’s cradle. This appliance,\r\nworking somewhat slowly, swings on rockers from side to side, and is\r\nusually employed in mills where, owing to the complexity of the ore,\r\ndifficulties have been met with in amalgamating the gold. Riffles are\r\nprovided and even very fine gold is sometimes effectively recovered by\r\ntheir aid.\r\n\r\nThe Frue vanner will, as a rule, act well when the pulp is sufficiently\r\nand consistently fine. It is an adaptation of the old simple apparatus\r\nused in China and India for washing gold dust from river sand. The\r\noriginal consisted of an endless band of strong cloth or closely woven\r\nmatting, run on two horizontal rollers placed about seven feet apart,\r\none being some inches lower than the other. The upper is caused to\r\nrevolve by means of a handle. The cloth is thus dragged upwards against\r\na small stream of water and sand fed to it by a second man, the first\r\nman not only turning the handle but giving a lateral motion to the band\r\nby means of a rope tied to one side.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 24. FRUE VANNER.]\r\n\r\nChinamen were working these forerunners of the Frue vanner fifty years\r\nago in Australia, and getting fair returns.\r\n\r\nThe Frue vanner (Fig. 24) is an endless india-rubber band drawn over an\r\ninclined table, to which a revolving and side motion is given by\r\ningenious mechanism, the pulp being automatically fed from the upper\r\nend, and the concentrates collected in a trough containing water in\r\nwhich the band is immersed in its passage under the table; the lighter\r\nparticles wash over the lower end. The only faults with the vanner\r\nare--first, it is rather slow; and secondly, though so ingenious it is\r\njust a little complicated in construction for the average non-scientific\r\noperative.\r\n\r\nOf pan concentrators there is an enormous selection, the principle in\r\nmost being similar--_i.e._, a revolving muller, which triturates the\r\nsand, so freeing the tiny golden particles and admitting of their\r\ncontact with the mercury. The mistake with respect to most of these\r\nmachines is the attempt to grind and amalgamate in one operation. Even\r\nwhen the stone under treatment contains no deleterious compounds the\r\nsimple action of grinding the hard siliceous particles has a bad effect\r\non the quicksilver, causing it to separate into small globules, which\r\neither oxidising or becoming coated with the impurities contained in the\r\nore will not reunite, but wash away in the slimes and take with them a\r\npercentage of the gold. As a grinder and concentrator, and in some cases\r\nas an amalgamator, when used exclusively for either purpose, the Watson\r\nand Denny pan (Fig. 25) is effective; but although successfully used at\r\none mine I know, the mode there adopted would, for reasons previously\r\ngiven, be very wasteful in many other mines.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 25. WATSON AND DENNY PAN.]\r\n\r\nThere is much misconception, even among men with some practical\r\nknowledge, as to the proper function of these saving appliances; and\r\nsometimes good machines are condemned because they fail to perform work\r\nthey were not intended for.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too clearly realised that the correct order of procedure\r\nfor extracting the gold held in combination with base metals is--first,\r\nreduction of the particles to a uniform gauge and careful concentration\r\nonly; next, the dissipation, usually by simple calcination, of\r\nsubstances in the concentrates inimical to the thorough absorption of\r\nthe gold by the mercury; and lastly, the amalgamation of the gold and\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nFor general purposes, where the gangue has not been crushed too fine, I\r\nthink the Duncan pan will usually be found effective in saving the\r\nconcentrates. In theory it is an enlargement of the alluvial miner’s tin\r\ndish, and the motion imparted to it is similar to the eccentric motion\r\nof that simple separator.\r\n\r\nThe calcining may be effectively carried out in an ordinary\r\nreverberatory furnace, the only skill required being to prevent over\r\n“roasting” and so slagging the concentrates; or not sufficiently\r\ncalcining so as to remove all deleterious constituents; the subject,\r\nhowever, is fully treated in Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\nFor amalgamating I prefer some form of settler to any further grinding\r\nappliance, but I note also improvements in the rotary amalgamating\r\nbarrel, which, though slow, is, under favourable conditions, an\r\neffective amalgamator. The introduction of steam under pressure into an\r\niron cylinder containing a charge of concentrates with mercury is said\r\nto have produced good results, and I am quite prepared to believe such\r\nwould be the case, as we have long known that the application of steam\r\nto ores in course of amalgamation facilitates the process considerably.\r\n\r\nSome twenty-five years since I also was engaged on the construction of a\r\ndry amalgamator in which sublimated mercury was passed from a retort\r\nthrough the descending gangue in a vertical cylinder, the material\r\nfalling therefrom through an aperture into a revolving settler, the\r\nobject being to save water on mines in dry country. The model, about\r\nquarter size, was completed, when my attention was called to an American\r\ninvention, in which the same result was stated to be attained more\r\neffectively by blowing the mercury spray through the triturated material\r\nby means of a steam jet. I had already encountered a difficulty, since\r\nfound so obstructive by experimentalists in the same direction, that\r\nis, the getting of the mercury back into its liquid metallic form. This\r\ndifficulty can be largely obviated by my own device of using a very weak\r\nsolution of sulphuric acid (it can hardly be too weak) and adding a\r\nsmall quantity of zinc to the mercury. It is perfectly marvellous how\r\nsome samples of mercury “sickened” or “floured” by bad treatment, may be\r\nbrought back to the bright, clean, easy flowing metal by a judicious use\r\nof these inexpensive materials.\r\n\r\nThus it will probably be found practicable to crush dry and amalgamate\r\nsemi-dry by passing the material in the form of a thin pasty mass to a\r\nsettler, as in the old South American arrastra, and, by slowly stirring,\r\nrecover the mercury, and with it the bulk of the gold.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Australian Mining Standard_, and was headed\r\n“Amalgamation Without Overflow”:\r\n\r\n    “Recent experiments at the Ballarat School of Mines have proved\r\n    that a deliverance from difficulties is at hand from an unexpected\r\n    quarter. The despised Chilian mill and Wheeler pan, discarded at\r\n    many mines, will solve the problem, but the keynote of success is\r\n    amalgamation without overflow. Dispense with the overflow and the\r\n    gold is saved.\r\n\r\n    “Two typical mines--the Great Mercury Proprietary Gold Mine,\r\n    of Kuaotunu, N.Z., the other, the Pambula, N.S.W.--have lately\r\n    been conducting a series of experiments with the object of saving\r\n    their fine gold in an economical manner. The last and best trials\r\n    made by these companies were at the Ballarat School of Mines, where\r\n    amalgamation without overflow was put to a crucial test, in each\r\n    case with the gratifying result that ninety-six per cent. of the\r\n    precious metal was secured. What this means to the Great Mercury\r\n    Mine, for instance, can easily be imagined when it is understood\r\n    that notwithstanding all the latest gold-saving adjuncts during the\r\n    last six months 1260 tons of ore, worth £4. 17_s._ 10-2/3_d._ a ton,\r\n    have been put through for a saving of £1 9_s._ 1-2/3_d._ only; or\r\n    in other words over two-thirds of the gold has gone to waste (for\r\n    the time being) in the tailings, and in the tailings at the present\r\n    moment lie the dividends that should have cheered shareholders’\r\n    hearts.\r\n\r\n    “And now for the _modus operandi_, which, it must be remembered,\r\n    is not hedged in by big royalties to any one, rights, patent or\r\n    otherwise. The ore to be treated is first calcined, then put through\r\n    a rock-breaker or stamper battery in a perfectly dry state. If the\r\n    battery is used, ordinary precautions, of course, must be taken\r\n    to prevent waste, or the dust becoming obnoxious to the workmen.\r\n    The ore is then transferred to the Chilian mill and made to the\r\n    consistency of porridge, the quicksilver being added. When the\r\n    principal work of amalgamation is done (experience soon teaching the\r\n    amount of grinding necessary), from the Chilian mill the paste (so\r\n    to say) is passed to a Wheeler or any other good pan of a similar\r\n    type, when the gold-saving operation is completed.”\r\n\r\nThis being an experiment in the same direction as my own, I tried it on\r\na small scale. I calcined some very troublesome ore till it was fairly\r\n“sweet,” triturated it, and having reduced it with water to about the\r\nconsistency of invalid’s gruel, put it into a little berdan pan made\r\nfrom a “camp oven,” which I had used for treating small quantities of\r\nconcentrates, and from time to time drove a spray of mercury, wherein a\r\nsmall amount of zinc had been dissolved, into the pasty mass by means of\r\na steam jet, added about half an ounce of sulphuric acid and kept the\r\npan revolving for several hours. The result was an unusually successful\r\namalgamation and consequent extraction--over ninety per cent.\r\n\r\nSteam--or to use the scientific term, hydro-thermal action--has played\r\nsuch an important part in the deposition of metals that I cannot but\r\nthink that under educated intelligence it will prove a powerful agent in\r\ntheir extraction. Twenty-five years ago I obtained some rather\r\nremarkable results from simply boiling auriferous ferro-sulphides in\r\nwater. There is in this alone an interesting, useful, and profitable\r\nfield for investigation and experiment.\r\n\r\nThe most scientific and perfect mode of gold extraction (when the\r\nconditions are favourable) is lixiviation by means of chlorine,\r\npotassium cyanide, or other aurous solvent, for by this means as much as\r\n98 per cent. of the gold contained in suitable ores can be converted\r\ninto its mineral salt, and being dissolved in water, re-deposited in\r\nmetallic form for smelting; but lode stuff containing much lime would\r\nnot be suitable for chlorination, or the presence of a considerable\r\nproportion of such a metal as copper, particularly in metallic form,\r\nwould be fatal to success, while cyanide of potassium will also attack\r\nmetals other than gold, and hence discount the effect of that solvent.\r\n\r\nThe earlier practical applications of chlorine to gold extraction were\r\nknown as Mears’ and Plattner’s processes, and consisted in placing the\r\nmaterial to be operated on in vats with water, and introducing chlorine\r\ngas at the bottom, the mixture being allowed to stand for a number of\r\nhours, the minimum about twelve, the maximum forty-eight. The\r\nchlorinated water was then drawn off containing the gold in solution\r\nwhich was deposited as a brown powder by the addition of sulphate of\r\niron.\r\n\r\nGreat improvements on this slow and imperfect method have been made of\r\nlate years, among the earlier of which was that of Messrs. Newbery and\r\nVautin. They placed the pulp with water in a gas-tight revolving\r\ncylinder, into which the chlorine was introduced, and atmospheric air to\r\na pressure of 60 lb. to the square inch was pumped in. The cylinder with\r\nits contents was revolved for two hours, then the charge was withdrawn\r\nand drained nearly dry by suction, the resultant liquid being slowly\r\nfiltered through broken charcoal on which the chloride crystals were\r\ndeposited, in appearance much like the bromo-chlorides of silver ore\r\nseen on some of the black manganic oxides of the Barrier silver mines.\r\nThe charcoal, with its adhering chlorides, was conveyed to the\r\nsmelting-house and the gold smelted into bars of extremely pure metal.\r\nMessrs. Newbery and Vautin claimed for their process decreased time for\r\nthe operation with increased efficiency.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Morgan, when I visited that mine in the eighties, they were\r\nusing what might be termed a composite adaptation process. Their\r\nchlorination works, the largest in the world, were putting through 1500\r\ntons per week. The ore as it came from the mine was fed automatically\r\ninto Krumm roller mills, and after being crushed and sifted to\r\nregulation gauge was delivered into trucks and conveyed to the roasting\r\nfurnaces, and thence to cooling floors, from which it was conveyed to\r\nthe chlorinating shed. Here were long rows of revolving barrels, on the\r\nNewbery-Vautin principle, but with this marked difference, that the\r\npressure in the barrel was obtained from an excess of the gas itself,\r\ngenerated from a charge of chloride of lime and sulphuric acid. On\r\nleaving the barrels the pulp ran into settling vats, somewhat on the\r\nPlattner plan, and the clear liquid having been drained off was passed\r\nthrough a charcoal filter, as adopted by Newbery and Vautin. The\r\nmanager, Mr. Wesley Hall, stated that the estimated cost per ton was not\r\nmore than 30_s._, and he expected shortly to reduce that when he began\r\nmaking his own sulphuric acid. As he was obtaining over 4 oz. to the ton\r\nthe process was paying very well, but it will be seen that the price\r\nwould be prohibitive for poor ores unless they could be concentrated\r\nbefore calcination.\r\n\r\nThe Pollok process is a newer, and stated to be a cheaper mode of\r\nlixiviation by chlorine. It is the invention of Mr. J. H. Pollok, of\r\nGlasgow University, and a strong Company was formed to work it. With him\r\nthe gas is produced by the admixture of bisulphate of sodium (instead of\r\nsulphuric acid, which is a very costly chemical to transport) and\r\nchloride of lime. Water is then pumped into a strong receptacle\r\ncontaining the material for treatment and powerful hydraulic pressure is\r\napplied. The effect is stated to be the rapid change of the metal into\r\nits salt, which is dissolved in the water and afterwards treated with\r\nsulphate of iron, and so made to resume its metallic form.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, to me that there is no essential difference in the\r\npressure brought to bear for the quickening of the process. In each case\r\nit is an air cushion, induced in the one process by the pumping in of\r\nair to a cylinder partly filled with water, and in the other by pumping\r\nin water to a cylinder partly filled with air.\r\n\r\nThe process of extracting gold from lode stuff and tailings by means of\r\ncyanide of potassium is now largely used and may be thus briefly\r\ndescribed:--It is chiefly applied to tailings, that is, crushed ore that\r\nhas already passed over the amalgamating and blanket tables. The\r\ntailings are placed in vats, and subjected to the action of solutions of\r\ncyanide of potassium of varying strengths down to 0·2 per cent. These\r\ndissolve the gold, which is leached from the tailings, passed through\r\nboxes in which it is precipitated either by means of zinc shavings,\r\nelectricity, or other precipitant. The solution is made up to its former\r\nstrength and passed again through fresh tailings. When the tailings\r\ncontain a quantity of decomposed pyrites, partly oxidised, the acidity\r\ncaused by the freed sulphuric acid requires to be neutralised by an\r\nalkali, caustic soda being usually employed.\r\n\r\nWhen “cleaning up,” the cyanide solution in the zinc precipitating boxes\r\nis replaced by clean water. After careful washing in the box, to cause\r\nall pure gold and zinc to fall to the bottom, the zinc shavings are\r\ntaken out. The precipitates are then collected, and after calcination in\r\na special furnace for the purpose of oxidising the zinc, are smelted in\r\nthe usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe following description of an electrolytic method of gold deposition\r\nfrom a cyanide solution was given by Mr. A. L. Eltonhead before the\r\nEngineers’ Club of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nA description of the process is as follows:--“The ore is crushed to a\r\ncertain fineness, depending on the character of the gangue. It is then\r\nplaced in leaching vats, with false bottoms for filtration, similar to\r\nother leaching plants. A solution of cyanide of potassium and other\r\nchemicals of known percentage is run over the pulp and left to stand a\r\ncertain number of hours, depending on the amount of metal to be\r\nextracted. It is then drained off and another charge of the same\r\nsolution is used, but of less strength, which is also drained. The pulp\r\nis now washed with clean water, which leaches all the gold and silver\r\nout, and leaves the tailings ready for discharge, either in cars or\r\nsluiced away by water, if it is plentiful.\r\n\r\n“The chemical reaction of cyanide of potassium with gold is as follows,\r\naccording to Elsner:--\r\n\r\n    ₂Au + ₄KCy + O + H₂O = ₂KAuCy₂ + ₂KHO.\r\n\r\n    That is, a double cyanide of gold and potassium is formed.\r\n\r\n    “All filtered solutions and washings from the leaching vats\r\n    are saved and passed through a precipitating ‘box’ of novel\r\n    construction, which may consist either of glass, iron or wood,\r\n    and be made in any shape, either oval, round, or rectangular--if\r\n    the latter, it will be about 10 ft. long, 4 ft. wide and 1 ft.\r\n    high--and is partitioned off lengthwise into five compartments.\r\n    Under each partition, on the inside or bottom of the ‘box,’ grooves\r\n    may be cut a quarter-to a half-inch deep, extending parallel with\r\n    the partitions to serve as a reservoir for the amalgam, and give a\r\n    rolling motion to the solution as it passes along and through the\r\n    four compartments. The centre compartment is used to hold the lead\r\n    or other suitable anode and electrolyte.\r\n\r\n    “The anode is supported on a movable frame or bracket, so it\r\n    may be moved either up or down as desired, it being worked by\r\n    thumb-screws at each end.\r\n\r\n    “The electrolyte may consist of saturated solutions of soluble\r\n    alkaline metals and earths. The sides or partitions of each\r\n    compartment dip into the mercury, which must cover the ‘box’ evenly\r\n    on the bottom to the depth of about a half-inch.\r\n\r\n    “Amalgamated copper strips or discs are placed in contact with\r\n    the mercury and extended above it, to allow the gold and silver\r\n    solution of cyanide to come in contact.\r\n\r\n    “The electrodes are connected with the dynamo; the anode of\r\n    lead being positive and the cathode of mercury being negative. The\r\n    dynamo is started, and a current of high amperage and low voltage\r\n    is generated, generally 100 to 125 amperes, and with sufficient\r\n    pressure to decompose the electrolyte between the anode and the\r\n    cathode.\r\n\r\n    “As the gas is generated at the anode, a commotion is created\r\n    in the liquid, which brings a fresh and saturated solution of\r\n    electrolyte between the electrodes for electrolysis, and makes it\r\n    continuous in its action.\r\n\r\n    “The solution of double cyanide of gold, silver, and potassium,\r\n    which has been drained from the leaching vats, is passed over the\r\n    mercury in the precipitating ‘box’ when the decomposition of the\r\n    electrolyte by the electric current is being accomplished, the\r\n    gold and silver are set free and unite with the mercury, and are\r\n    also deposited on the plates or discs of copper, forming amalgam,\r\n    which is collected and made marketable by the well-known and tried\r\n    methods. The above solution is regenerated with cyanide of potassium\r\n    by the setting free of the metals in the passage over the ‘box.’\r\n\r\n    “In using this solution again for a fresh charge of pulp, it is\r\n    reinforced to the desired percentage, or strengthened with cyanide\r\n    of potassium and other chemicals, and is always in good condition\r\n    for continuing the operation of dissolving.\r\n\r\n    “The potassium acting on the water of the solution creates\r\n    nascent hydrogen and potassium hydrate; the nascent hydrogen sets\r\n    free the metals (gold and silver), which are precipitated into the\r\n    mercury and form amalgam, leaving hydrocyanic acid; this latter\r\n    combines with the potassium hydrate of the former reaction, thus\r\n    forming cyanide of potassium. There are other reactions for which I\r\n    have not at present the chemical formulas.\r\n\r\n    “As the solution passes over the mercury, the centre compartment\r\n    of the ‘box’ is moved slowly longitudinally, which spreads the\r\n    mercury, the solution is agitated and comes in perfect contact with\r\n    the mercury, as well as the amalgamated plates or discs of copper,\r\n    ensuring a perfect precipitation.\r\n\r\n    “It is not always necessary to precipitate all the gold and\r\n    silver from the solution, for it is used over and over again\r\n    indefinitely; but when it is required, it can be done perfectly and\r\n    cheaply in a very short time.\r\n\r\n    “No solution leached from the pulp, containing cyanide of\r\n    potassium, gold and silver, need be run to waste, which is in itself\r\n    an enormous saving over the use of zinc shavings when handling large\r\n    quantities of pulp and solution.\r\n\r\n    “Some of the advantages the electro-chemical process has over\r\n    other cyanide processes are: Its cleanliness, quickness of action,\r\n    cheapness, and large saving of cyanide of potassium by regeneration;\r\n    not wasting the solutions, larger recovery of the gold and silver\r\n    from the solutions; the cost of recovery less; the loss of gold,\r\n    silver, and cyanide of potassium reduced to a minimum; the use\r\n    of caustic alkali in such quantity as may be desired to keep the\r\n    cyanide solution from being destroyed by the acidity of the pulp,\r\n    and also sometimes to give warmth, as a warm cyanide solution will\r\n    dissolve gold and silver quicker than a cold one. These caustic\r\n    alkalies do not interfere with or prevent the perfect precipitation\r\n    of the metals. The bullion recovered in this process is very fine,\r\n    while the zinc-precipitated bullion is only about 700 fine.\r\n\r\n    “The gold and silver is dissolved, and then precipitated in\r\n    one operation, which we know cannot be done in the ‘chlorination\r\n    process’; besides, the cost of plant and treatment is much less in\r\n    the above-described process.\r\n\r\n    “The electro-chemical process, which I have hastily sketched\r\n    will, I think, be the future cheap method of recovering fine or\r\n    flour gold from our mines and waste tailings or ore dumps.\r\n\r\n    “Without going into details of cost of treatment, I will state\r\n    that with a plant of a capacity of handling 10,000 tons of pulp\r\n    per month, the cost should not exceed 8_s._ per ton, but that may\r\n    be cheapened by labour-saving devices. There being no expensive\r\n    machinery, a plant could be very cheaply erected wherever necessary.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    CALCINATION OR ROASTING OF ORES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of calcining or roasting certain ores before treatment is to\r\ndissipate the sulphur or sulphides of arsenic, antimony, lead, &c.,\r\nwhich are inimical to treatment, whether by ordinary mercuric\r\namalgamation or lixiviation. The effect of the roasting is first to\r\nsublimate and drive off as fumes the sulphur and a proportion of the\r\nobjectionable metals. What is left is either iron oxide, “gossan,” or\r\nthe oxides of the other metals. Even lead can thus be oxidised, but\r\nrequires more care as it melts nearly as readily as antimony and is much\r\nless volatile. The oxides in the thoroughly roasted ore will not\r\namalgamate with mercury, and are not acted on by chlorine or cyanogen.\r\n\r\nTo effect the oxidation of sulphur, it is necessary not only to bring\r\nevery particle of sulphur into contact with the oxygen of the air, but\r\nalso to provide adequate heat to the particles sufficient to raise them\r\nto the temperature that will induce oxidation. No appreciable effect\r\nfollows the mere contact of air with sulphur particles at atmospheric\r\ntemperature; but if the particles be raised to a temperature of 500°\r\nFahr., the sulphur is oxidised to the gaseous sulphur dioxide. The same\r\naction effects the elimination of the arsenic and antimony associated\r\nwith gold and silver ores, as when heated to a certain constant\r\ntemperature these metals readily oxidise.\r\n\r\nThe science of calcination consists of the method by which the sulphide\r\nores, having been crushed to a proper degree of fineness, are raised to\r\na sufficient temperature and brought into intimate contact with\r\natmospheric air.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious then that the most effective method of roasting will\r\nbe one that enables the particles to be thoroughly oxidised at the\r\nlowest cost in fuel and in the most rapid manner.\r\n\r\nThe roasting processes in practical use may be divided into three\r\ncategories:\r\n\r\n_First or Process A._--Roasting on a horizontal and stationary hearth,\r\nthe flame passing over a mass of ore resting on such hearth. In order to\r\nexpose the upper surface of the ore to contact with air the material is\r\nturned over by manual labour. This furnace of the reverberatory type is\r\nprovided with side openings by which the turning over of the ore can be\r\nmanually effected, and the new ore can be charged and afterwards\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n_Second or Process B._--Roasting in a revolving hearth placed at a\r\nslightly inclined angle from the horizontal. The furnace is of\r\ncylindrical form, and is internally lined with refractory material. It\r\nhas projections that cause the powdered ore to be lifted above the\r\nflame, and, at a certain height, to fall through the flame and so be\r\nrapidly raised to the temperature required to effect the oxidation of\r\nthe oxidisable minerals which it is desired to extract.\r\n\r\nThe rate, or speed, of revolution of this revolving furnace obviously\r\ndepends upon the character of the ore under treatment; it may vary from\r\ntwo revolutions per minute down to one revolution in thirty minutes. Any\r\nkind of fuel is available, but that of a gaseous character is stated to\r\nbe by far the most efficient.\r\n\r\nAny ordinary cylinder of a length of 25 ft., and a diameter of 4 ft. 6\r\nin., inclined 1 ft. 6 in. in its length, will calcine from 24 to 48 tons\r\nper diem.\r\n\r\nAnother form of rotating furnace is one in which the axis is horizontal.\r\nIt is much shorter than the inclined type, and the feeding and removal\r\nof the ore is effected by the opening of a retort lid door provided at\r\nthe side of the furnace. Openings provided at each end of the furnace\r\npermit the passage of the flame through it, and the revolution of the\r\nfurnace turns over the powdered ore and brings it into more or less\r\nsustained contact is continued sufficiently long to ensure the more or\r\nless complete oxidation of the ore particles.\r\n\r\n_Third or Process C._--In this process the powdered ore is allowed to\r\nfall in a shower from a considerable height, through the centre of a\r\nvertical shaft up which a flame ascends; the powdered ore in falling\r\nthrough the flame is heated to an oxidising temperature, and the\r\nsulphides are thus depleted of their sulphur and become oxides.\r\n\r\nAnother modification of this direct fall or shaft furnace is that in\r\nwhich the fall of the ore is checked by cross-bars or inclined plates\r\nplaced across the shaft; this causes a longer oxidising exposure of the\r\nore particles.\r\n\r\nWhen the sulphur contents of pyritous ores are sufficiently high, and\r\nafter the ore has been initially fired with auxiliary carbonaceous fuel,\r\nit is unnecessary, in a properly designed roasting furnace, to add fuel\r\nto the ore to enable the heat for oxidation to be obtained. The\r\noxidation or burning of the sulphur will provide all the heat necessary\r\nto maintain the continuity of the process. The temperature necessary for\r\neffecting the elimination of both sulphur and arsenic is not higher than\r\nthat equivalent to dull red heat; and provided that there is a\r\nsufficient mass of ore maintained in the furnace, the potential heat\r\nresulting from the oxidation of the sulphur will alone be adequate to\r\nprovide all that is necessary to effect the calcination.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TYPES OF FURNACES OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES THAT ARE IN ACTUAL USE.\r\n\r\n    “A” OR Reverberatory Class.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this furnace has already been sufficiently\r\ndescribed. If the roasting is performed in a muffle chamber, the\r\narrangement employed by Messrs. Leach and Neal, Limited, of Derby, and\r\ndesigned by Mr. B. H. Thwaite, C.E., can be advantageously employed in\r\nthis furnace, which is fired with gaseous fuel. The sensible heat of the\r\nwaste gases is utilised to heat the air employed for combustion; and by\r\na controllable arrangement of combustion, a flame of over 100 feet in\r\nlength is obtained, with the result that the furnace from end to end is\r\nmaintained at a uniform temperature. By this system, and with gaseous\r\nfuel firing, a very considerable economy in fuel and in repairs to\r\nfurnace, and a superior roasting effect, have been obtained.\r\n\r\nWhere the ordinary reverberatory hearth is fired with solid coal from an\r\nend grate, the temperature is at its maximum near the firing end, and\r\ntails off at the extreme gas outlet end. The ores in this furnace should\r\ntherefore be fed in at the colder end of the hearth and be gradually\r\nworked or “rabbled” forward to the firing end.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of the reverberatory furnace is the fact that it is\r\nimpossible to avoid the incursion of air during the manual rabbling\r\naction, and this tends to cool the furnace.\r\n\r\nThe cost of roasting, to obtain the more or less complete oxidation, or\r\nwhat is known in mining parlance as a “sweet roast” (because a perfectly\r\nroasted ore is nearly odourless) varies considerably, the variation\r\ndepending of course upon the character of the ore and the cost of labour\r\nand fuel.\r\n\r\nThere are several modifications of the reverberatory furnace in use,\r\ndesigned mechanically to effect the rabbling. One of the most successful\r\nis that known as the Horse-shoe furnace. In plan the hearth of the\r\nfurnace resembles a horse-shoe.\r\n\r\nThe stirring of the ore over the hearth is effected by means of\r\ncarriages fixed in the centre of the furnace and having laterally\r\nprojecting arms, carrying stirrers, that move along the hearth and turn\r\nover the pulverised ore.\r\n\r\nIn operation, half the carriages are traversing the furnace, and half\r\nare resting in the cooling space, so that a control over the temperature\r\nof the stirrers is established.\r\n\r\nThis furnace is stated to be more economical in labour than other\r\nmechanically stirred reverberatory furnaces, and there is also said to\r\nbe an economy in fuel.\r\n\r\nUsually the mechanical stirring furnaces give trouble and should be\r\navoided, but the horse-shoe type possesses qualifications worthy of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “B.” The Revolving Cylinder Furnace.\r\n\r\nOf these some of the best known to me are: The Howell-White, The\r\nBrückner, The Thwaite-Denny, and the Molesworth.\r\n\r\nThe Brückner is a cylinder, turning on its horizontal axis and carried\r\nby four rollers.\r\n\r\nThe batch of ore usually charged into the two charging hoppers weighs\r\nabout four tons. When the two charging doors are brought under the\r\nhopper mouth, the contents of the hopper fall directly into the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nThe ends or throats of the furnace are reduced just sufficiently to\r\nallow the flame evolved from a grated furnace to pass completely through\r\nthe cylinder.\r\n\r\nA characteristic size for this Brückner furnace is one having a length\r\nof 12 feet and a diameter of 6 feet. A furnace of this capacity will\r\nhave an inclusive weight (iron and brickwork) of 15 tons.\r\n\r\nThe time of operation, with the Brückner, will vary with the character\r\nof the ore under treatment and the nature of the fuel employed. Four\r\nhours is the minimum and twelve hours should be the maximum time of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nBy the addition of common salt with the batch of ore, such of its\r\nconstituents as are amenable to the action of chlorine are chlorinated\r\nas well as freed from sulphur.\r\n\r\nWhere the ore contains any considerable quantity of silver which should\r\nbe saved, the addition of the salt is necessary as the silver is very\r\nliable to become so oxidised in the process of roasting as to render its\r\nafter treatment almost impossible. I know a case in point where an\r\naverage of nearly five ounces of silver to the ton, at that time worth\r\n30_s_., was lost owing to ignorance on this subject. Had the ore been\r\ncalcined with salt, NaCl, the bulk of this silver would have been\r\namalgamated and thus saved. It was the extraordinary fineness of the\r\ngold saved by amalgamation as against my tests of the ore by fire assay\r\nthat put me on the track of a most indefensible loss.\r\n\r\n_The Howell-White Furnace._--This furnace consists of a cast iron\r\nrevolving cylinder, averaging 25 feet in length and 4 ft. 4 in. in\r\ndiameter, which revolves on four friction rollers, resting on truck\r\nwheels, rotated by ordinary gearing.\r\n\r\nThe power required for effecting the revolution should not exceed four\r\nindicated horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is internally lined with firebrick, projecting pieces\r\ncausing the powdered ore to be raised over the flame through which it\r\nshowers, and is thereby subjected to the influence of heat and to direct\r\ncontact oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the cylinder, which is variable, promotes the gradual\r\ndescension of the ore from the higher to the lower end. It is fed into\r\nthe upper end, by a special form of feed hopper, and is discharged into\r\na pit at the lower end, from which the ore can be withdrawn at any time.\r\n\r\nThe gross weight of this furnace, which is, however, made in segments to\r\nbe afterwards bolted together, is some ninety to one hundred tons.\r\n\r\nThe furnace is fired with coal on a grated hearth, built at the lower\r\nend; it is more economical both in fuel and in labour than an ordinary\r\nreverberatory furnace.\r\n\r\n_The Thwaite-Denny Revolving Furnace._--This new type of furnace, which\r\nis fired with gaseous fuel, is stated to combine the advantages of the\r\nStetefeldt, the Howell-White, and the Brückner.\r\n\r\nIt is constructed as follows:--Three short cylinders, conical in shape\r\nand of graduated dimensions, are superposed one over the other, their\r\nends terminating in two vertical shafts of brickwork, by which the three\r\ncylinders are connected. The powdered ore is fed into the uppermost\r\ncylinder and gravitates through the series. The highest cylinder is the\r\nlargest in diameter, the lowest the smallest.\r\n\r\nThe gas flame, burnt in a Bunsen arrangement, enters the smallest end of\r\nthe lowest cylinder and passes through it; then returns through the\r\nintermediate cylinder above it, being directed by the brickwork\r\nshaft--from one cylinder to the other--till finally the gases flow\r\nthrough the topmost cylinder and enter into a dust depositing chamber.\r\nThe gases evolved increase as the flame flows through the series and the\r\nore is reduced by the expulsion of its sulphur, arsenic, &c., as it\r\ndescends from the top to the bottom. The top cylinder is made larger\r\nthan the one below it and the middle cylinder is made larger than the\r\nlowest one in proportion to the increased bulk of gases and ore.\r\n\r\nThe powdered ore in descending through the cylinders is lifted up and\r\nshowers through the flame, falling in its descent a distance of over\r\n1000 feet. By the time it reaches the bottom the ore is thoroughly\r\nroasted.\r\n\r\nProvision is made for the introduction of separate supplies of air and\r\ngas into each cylinder; this enables the oxidising treatment to be\r\ncontrolled exactly as desired so as to effect the best results with all\r\nkinds of ore. Each cylinder is driven from its own independent gearing,\r\nand the speed of each cylinder can be varied at will.\r\n\r\nThe output of this type of furnace, the operations of which appear to be\r\nmore controllable than those of similar appliances, depends, of course,\r\nupon the nature of the ore, but may be considered to range within the\r\nlimits of twelve to fifty tons in twenty-four hours, and the cost of\r\nroasting will vary from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 4_s._ per ton, depending upon the\r\nquality of ore and of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous fuel generating system permits not only the absolute control\r\nover the temperature in the furnace, but the use of the commonest kinds\r\nof coal, and even charcoal is available.\r\n\r\nThe power required to drive the Thwaite-Denny furnace is four indicated\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\n_The Molesworth Furnace_ also is a revolving cylindrical appliance,\r\nwhich, to say the least of it, is in many respects novel and ingenious.\r\nIt consists of a slightly cone-shaped, cast-iron cylinder about fourteen\r\nfeet long, the outlet end being the larger to allow for the expansion of\r\nthe gases. Internal studs are so arranged as to keep the ore agitated;\r\nand spiral flanges convey it to the outlet end continually, shooting it\r\nacross the cylinder. The cylinder is encased in a brick furnace. The\r\nfiring is provided from _outside_, the inventor maintaining that the\r\nproducts of combustion are inimical to rapid oxidisation, to specially\r\npromote which he introduces an excess of oxygen produced in a small\r\nretort set in the roof of the furnace and fed from time to time with\r\nsmall quantities of nitrate of soda and sulphuric acid. Ores containing\r\nmuch sulphur virtually calcine themselves. I have seen this appliance\r\ndoing good work. The difficulties appeared to be principally mechanical.\r\n\r\nThere are other furnaces which work with outside heat, but I have not\r\nseen them in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “C.”--Shaft Type of Furnace.\r\n\r\nIn one form of this furnace, instead of allowing the ore to descend in a\r\ndirect clear fall the descent is impeded by inclined planes placed at\r\ndifferent levels in the height of the shaft, the ore descending from one\r\nplane to the other.\r\n\r\n_The Stetefeldt Shaft Furnace._--Although very expensive in first cost,\r\nhas many advantages. No motive power is required and the structure of\r\nthe furnace is of a durable character. Its disadvantages are:--Want\r\nof control, and the occasionally imperfect character of the roasting\r\noriginating therefrom.\r\n\r\nThree sizes of Stetefeldt’s furnaces are constructed:\r\n\r\n    The largest will roast from 40 to 80 tons per diem.\r\n\r\n    The intermediate     ”     ”    20  ” 40     ”     ”      ”\r\n\r\n    The smallest         ”     ”    10  ” 20     ”     ”      ”\r\n\r\nA good furnace should bring down the sulphur contents even of\r\nconcentrates so as to be innocuous to mercuric amalgamation. The sulphur\r\nleft in the ore should never be allowed to exceed two per cent.\r\n\r\nA forty per cent. pyritous or other sulphide ore should be roasted in a\r\nrevolving furnace in thirty to forty minutes, and without any auxiliary\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary purposes a 40-foot chimney is adequate for furnace work;\r\nsuch a chimney four feet square inside at the base, tapering to 2’ 6” at\r\nthe summit, will require 12,000 red bricks, and 1500 fire-bricks for an\r\ninternal lining to a height of 12 feet from the base of the chimney\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nWhen second-hand Lancashire or Cornish boiler flues are available, they\r\nmake admirable and inexpensive chimneys. The advantage of wrought-iron\r\nor steel chimneys lies in the convenience of removal and erection. They\r\nshould be made in sections of 20 feet long, three steel wire guy-ropes\r\nattached to a ring, riveted to a ring two-thirds of the height of the\r\nchimney, and attached to holdfasts driven into the ground; tightening\r\ncouplings should be provided for each wire.\r\n\r\nFlue dust depositing chambers should be built in the line of the flues\r\nbetween the furnace and the chimney; they consist simply of carefully\r\nbuilt brick chambers, with openings to enable workmen to enter and\r\nrapidly clear away the deposited matters. The chambers, three or four\r\ntimes the cross sectional area of the chimney flue, and ten to twenty\r\nfeet long, can be built of brickwork, set in cement; the walls are\r\nprovided with a cavity, filled with sand or Portland cement, so that\r\nthere will be no danger of the incursion of air. In all furnace work the\r\ngreatest possible precautions should be taken to prevent the least\r\ncracking of either joints or bricks. It is surprising how much the\r\ninadequate draft of a good chimney is due to cracks or orifices in the\r\nflues; and therefore a competent furnace-man should see to it that his\r\nflues are thoroughly sound, and free from openings through which the air\r\ncan enter.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] For full details of the most recent improvements in the\r\n    cyanide process and in other methods of extraction, the reader is\r\n    referred to Dr. T. K. Rose’s “Metallurgy of Gold,” third edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n    MOTOR POWER AND ITS TRANSMISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to describe the methods by which power for mining\r\npurposes has been obtained--that is, up to within the last five\r\nyears--beyond a general statement, that when water power has been\r\navailable in the immediate locality of the mine, this cheap natural\r\nsource of power has been called upon to do duty. Steam has been the\r\nalternative agent of power production applied in many different ways,\r\nbut labouring under as many disadvantages, chief of which are lack of\r\nwater, scarcity of fuel and cost of transit of machinery. Sometimes\r\ncondensing steam-engines have been employed. For the generation of steam\r\nthe semi-portable and semi-tubular have been the type of boiler that has\r\nmost usually been brought into service. Needless to say, when highly\r\nmineralised mine water only is available the adoption of this class of\r\nboiler is attended with anything but satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, there is strong evidence that where steam is the\r\npower agent to be employed the water-tube type of boiler is likely to be\r\nemployed, and to the exclusion of all other forms of apparatus for the\r\ngeneration of steam. The advantages of this type, particularly the\r\ntubulous form (or a small water tube), made as it is in sections, offers\r\nunrivalled facilities for transport service. The heaviest parts need not\r\nexceed 3 cwt. in weight, and require neither heavy nor yet expensive\r\nbrickwork foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WATERLESS POWER.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in finding water to drive a steam plant are often of\r\nsuch a serious character as to involve the abandonment of many payable\r\nmines; therefore, a motive power that does not require the aqueous agent\r\nwill be a welcome boon.\r\n\r\nIt will be a source of gratification to many a gold-claim holder to\r\nknow that practical science has enabled motive power to be produced\r\nwithout the necessity of water, except a certain very small quantity,\r\nwhich once supplied will not require to be renewed, unless to compensate\r\nfor the loss due to atmospheric evaporation.\r\n\r\nAny carbonaceous fuel, such as, say, lignite, coal, or charcoal, can be\r\nemployed. The latter can be easily produced by the method described in\r\nthe Chapter on “Rules of Thumb,” or by building a kiln by piling\r\ntogether a number of trunks of trees, or fairly large-sized branches,\r\ncut so that they can be built up in a compact form. The pile, after\r\nbeing covered with earth, is then lighted from the base, and if there\r\nare no inlets for the air except the limited proportion required for the\r\nsmouldering fire at the base, the whole of the timber will be gradually\r\ncarbonised to charcoal of good quality, which is available for the\r\nwaterless power plant.\r\n\r\nThe waterless power plant consists of two divisions: First, a gas\r\ngenerating plant; secondly, an internal combustion or gas engine in\r\nwhich the gas is burnt, producing by thermo-dynamic action the motive\r\npower required. The system known as the Thwaite Power Gas System is not\r\nonly practically independent of the use of water, but its efficiency in\r\nconverting fuel heat into work is so high that no existing steam plant\r\nwill be able to compete with it.\r\n\r\nThe weight of raw timber, afterwards to be converted into charcoal, that\r\nwill be required to produce an effective horse-power for one hour equals\r\n7 lb.\r\n\r\n    If coal is the fuel 1⅓ lb. per E. H. P. for one hour’s run.\r\n    If lignite     ”    2½          ”            ”      ”\r\n\r\nThe plant is simple to work, and as no steam boiler is required the\r\ndanger of explosions is removed. No expensive chimney is necessary for\r\nthe waterless power plant.\r\n\r\nWhere petroleum oil can be cheaply obtained, say for twopence per\r\ngallon, one of the Otto Cycle Oil Engines, for powers up to 20 indicated\r\nhorse-power, can be advantageously employed.\r\n\r\nThese engines have the advantage of being a self-contained power,\r\nrequiring neither chimney nor steam boiler, and may be said to be a\r\nwaterless power. The objection is the necessity to rely upon oil as\r\nfuel, and the dangers attending the storage of oil. A good oil engine\r\nshould not require to use more than a pint of refined petroleum per\r\nindicated horse-power working for one hour.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the mining industry electricity, that magic and\r\nmysterious agency, has come to its assistance, in permitting motive\r\npower to be transmitted over distances of even as much as 100 miles with\r\ncomparatively little loss of the original power energy.\r\n\r\nGiven, that on a coal or lignite field, or at a waterfall, 100\r\nhorse-power is developed by the combustion of fuel or by the fall of\r\nwater driving a turbine, this power can be electrically transmitted to a\r\nmine or GROUP OF MINES, say 100 miles away, with only a loss of some 30\r\nhorse-power. For twenty miles the loss on transmission should not exceed\r\n15 horse-power, so that 70 and 85 horse-power respectively are available\r\nat the mines. No other system offers such remarkable efficiencies of\r\npower transmission. The new Multiphase Alternating Electric Generating\r\nand Power Transmission System is indeed so perfect as to leave\r\npractically no margin for improvement.\r\n\r\nThe multiphase electric motor can be directly applied to the stamp\r\nbattery and ore-breaker driving-shaft and to the shaft of the\r\namalgamating pans.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Approximate Power Required to Drive the Machinery of a Mine.\r\n\r\n    Rock breaker                      10     effective horse-power\r\n    Amalgamating pan                   5            ”         ”\r\n    Grinding pan                       6            ”         ”\r\n    Single stamp of 750 lb. dropping\r\n       90 times per minute             1·25         ”         ”\r\n    Settlers                           4            ”         ”\r\n    Ordinary hoisting lift            20            ”         ”\r\n\r\n    Allow 10 per cent. in addition for overcoming friction.\r\n\r\nBesides this electrical distributing power, which should not cost more\r\nthan three farthings per effective horse-power per hour, the electrical\r\nenergy can be employed for lighting the drives and the shafts of the\r\nmine. The modern electrical mine lamps leave little to be desired. Also\r\nit is anticipated that once the few existing difficulties have been\r\nsurmounted electric drilling will supplant all other methods.\r\n\r\nElectric power can be employed for pumping, for shot firing, for\r\nhauling, and for innumerable purposes in a mine.\r\n\r\nElectricity lends itself most advantageously to so many and varied\r\nprocesses, even in accelerating the influence of cyanide solutions on\r\ngold, and in effecting the magnetic influence on metallic particles in\r\nseparating processes; while applied to haulage purposes, either on\r\naërial lines (Fig. 26) or on tram or railroads, it is an immediate and\r\nstriking success.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 26. ELECTRICAL AËRIAL TRAMWAY.]\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that in the near future the mines on the Rand, South\r\nAfrica, will be electrically driven from a coalfield generating station\r\nlocated on the coalfields some thirty miles from Johannesburg. Such a\r\nplant made up of small multiples of highly efficient machines will\r\nenable mine-owners to obtain a reliable power to any extent at immediate\r\ncommand and at a reasonable charge in proportion to the power used. This\r\nwholesale supply of power will be a godsend to a new field, enabling the\r\nopening up to be greatly expedited; and no climatic difficulties, such\r\nas dry seasons, or floods, need interfere with the regular running of\r\nthe machinery. The same system of power-generation at a central station\r\nis to be applied to supply power to the mines of Western Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    COMPANY FORMATION AND OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the world over, the operation of winning from the soil and rendering\r\nmarketable the many valuable ores and mine products which abound is\r\ndaily becoming more and more a scientific business which cannot be too\r\ncarefully entered into or too skilfully conducted. The days of the dolly\r\nand windlass, of the puddler, cradle, and tin dish, are rapidly\r\nreceding; and mining, either in lode or alluvial working, is being more\r\ngenerally recognised as one of the exact sciences. In the past, mining\r\nhas been carried on in a very haphazard fashion, to which much of its\r\nnon-success may be attributed.\r\n\r\nBut the dawn of better days has arrived, and with the advent of schools\r\nof mines and technical colleges there will in future be less excuse for\r\nignorance in this most important industry.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will be devoted to Company formation and working, in which\r\nmistakes leading to very serious consequences daily occur.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to go deeply into the question why, in the mining\r\nindustry more than any other, it should be deemed desirable as a general\r\nrule to carry on operations by means of public Companies, but, as a\r\nmatter of fact, few names can be mentioned of men who mine extensively\r\nsingle handed. Yet, risky as it is, mining is hardly more so than, say,\r\npastoral pursuits, in which private individuals risk, and often lose or\r\nmake, enormous sums of money.\r\n\r\nIn floating Mining Companies the first mistake usually made is not\r\nproviding sufficient working capital for meeting all necessary expenses\r\nuntil permanent profits are realisable. This neglect has caused the\r\nsacrifice of many good properties. In England, the Companies are often\r\nfloated fully paid up, but the same initial error of providing too\r\nlittle money for the equipment and effective working of the mine is\r\nusually fallen into.\r\n\r\nAgain, far too many Companies are floated on the report of plausible,\r\nignorant individuals posing as mining experts. These men acquire a few\r\ngeological and mining phrases, and by more or less skilfully\r\ninterlarding these with statements of large lodes and big returns they\r\nsupply reports seductive enough to float the most worthless properties\r\nand cause the waste of thousands of pounds. But the trouble does not end\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the Company is to be formed, some lawyer, competent or otherwise,\r\nis instructed to prepare articles of association, rules, &c., which,\r\nthree times out of four, is accomplished by a liberal employment of\r\nscissors and paste. Such rules may or may not be suited to the\r\nrequirements of the organisation. Generally no one troubles much about\r\nthe matter, though on these rules depends the future efficient working\r\nof the Company, and sometimes its very existence.\r\n\r\nThen Directors have to be appointed, and these are seldom selected\r\nbecause of any special knowledge of mining they may possess, but as a\r\nrule simply because they are large shareholders or prominent men whose\r\nnames look well in a prospectus. These gentlemen forthwith engage a\r\nSecretary, usually on the grounds that he is the person who has tendered\r\nlowest, to provide office accommodation and keep the accounts; and not\r\nfrom any particular knowledge he has of the true requirements of the\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe way in which some Directors contrive to spend their shareholders’\r\nmoney is humorously commented on by a Westralian paper which describes a\r\ngreat machinery consignment landed in the neighbourhood of the Boulder\r\nKalgoorlie.\r\n\r\n    “It would seem as if the purchaser had been let loose blindfold\r\n    in a prehistoric material founder’s old iron yard, and having bought\r\n    up the whole stock, had shipped it off. The feature of the entire\r\n    antediluvian show is the liberal allowance of material devoted\r\n    to destruction. Massive kibbles, such as were used in coal mines\r\n    half a century ago, are arranged alongside a winding engine,\r\n    built in the middle of the century, and evidently designed for\r\n    hauling the kibbles from a depth of 1000 feet. Nothing less than\r\n    horse power will stir the trucks for underground use, and their\r\n    design is distinctly of the antique type. The engine is built to\r\n    correspond--of a kind that might have served to raise into position\r\n    the pillars of Baalbec, and the mass of metal in it fairly raises\r\n    a blush to the iron cheek of frailer modern constructions. The one\r\n    grand use to which this monster could be put would be to employ it\r\n    as a kedge for the Australian continent in the event of it dragging\r\n    its present anchors and drifting down south, but as modern mining\r\n    machinery the whole consignment is worth no more than its value as\r\n    scrap-iron, which in its present position is a fraction or two less\r\n    than nothing.”\r\n\r\nNext a man to manage the mine has to be obtained, and some one is placed\r\nin charge, of whose capabilities the Directors have no direct knowledge.\r\nBeing profoundly ignorant of practical mining they are incompetent to\r\nexamine him as to his qualifications, or to check his mode of working,\r\nso as to ascertain whether he is acting rightly or not. All they have to\r\nrely on are some certificates often too carelessly given and too easily\r\nobtained. Finally, quite a large proportion of the allottees of shares\r\nhave merely applied for them with the intention of selling out on the\r\nfirst opportunity at a premium, hence they have no special interest in\r\nthe actual working of the mine.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at the prospects of the Association thus formed. The\r\nlegal Manager or Secretary, often a young and inexperienced man, knows\r\nlittle more than how to keep an ordinary set of books, and not always\r\nthat. He is quite ignorant of the actual requirements of the mine, or\r\nwhat is a fair price to pay for labour, appliances, or material. He\r\ncannot check the expenditure of the Mining Manager, who may be a rogue\r\nor a fool or both, for we have had samples of all sorts to our sorrow.\r\nThe Directors are in like case. Even where the information is honestly\r\nsupplied, they cannot judge whether the work is being properly carried\r\nout or is costing a fair price, and the Mining Manager is left to his\r\nown devices, with no one to check him nor any with whom he can consult\r\nin specially difficult cases. Thus matters drift to the almost certain\r\nconclusion of voluntary or compulsory winding up; and so many a good\r\nproperty is ruined, and promising mines, which have never had a\r\nreasonable trial, are condemned as worthless. But let us ask, would any\r\nother business, even such as are less subject to unforeseen vicissitudes\r\nthan mining, succeed under similar circumstances?\r\n\r\nIt is now very generally agreed that to the profitable development of\r\nmining, new countries at all events must look mainly for prosperity\r\nwhile other industries are growing. Therefore, we cannot too seriously\r\nconsider how we may soonest make our mines successful.\r\n\r\nWhat is the remedy for the unsatisfactory state of affairs we have\r\nexperienced? The answer is a more practical system of working from the\r\ninception. Although it may evoke some difference of opinion I consider\r\nit both justifiable and desirable that the State should take some\r\noversight of mining matters, at least in the case of public Companies.\r\nIt would be a salutary rule that the promoters of any mining undertaking\r\nshould, before they are allowed to place it on the market, obtain and\r\npay for the services of a competent Government Mining Inspector, who\r\nneed not necessarily be a Government officer, but might, like licensed\r\nsurveyors, be granted a certificate of competency either by a School of\r\nMines or by some qualified Board of Examiners. The certificate of such\r\nInspector that the property was as represented should be given before\r\nthe prospectus was issued. It is arguable whether even further oversight\r\nmight not properly be taken by the State, and the report of a qualified\r\nofficer be compulsory that the property was reasonably worth the value\r\nplaced upon it in the prospectus.\r\n\r\nProbably it will be contended that such restrictions would be an undue\r\ninterference with private rights, and the old aphorism about a fool and\r\nhis folly will be quoted. There are doubtless fools so infatuated that\r\nif they were brayed in a ten hundred-weight stamp battery the\r\nfoolishness that had not departed from them would give a highly payable\r\npercentage to the ton. Yet the State in other matters tries by numerous\r\nlaws to protect such from their folly. A man may not sell a load of wood\r\nwithout the certificate from a licensed weighbridge nor a loaf of bread\r\nwithout, if required, having to prove its weight; and we send those to\r\ngaol who practice on the credulity and cupidity of fools by means of the\r\n“confidence trick.” Why not, therefore, where interests which may be\r\nsaid to be national are involved, endeavour to ensure fair dealing?\r\n\r\nThen with regard to the men who are to manage our mines, seeing that a\r\nman may not become captain or mate of a river steamboat without some\r\ncertificate of competency, nor drive her engines before he has passed an\r\nexamination to prove his fitness, surely it is not too much to say that\r\nthe mine manager or engineer, to whose care are often confided the lives\r\nof hundreds of men, and the expenditure of thousands of pounds, should\r\nbe required to obtain a recognised diploma to prove his qualifications.\r\nThe examinations might be made comparatively easy at first, but\r\nafterwards, when by the establishment of Schools and Mines the\r\nfacilities have been afforded for men to thoroughly qualify, the\r\nstandard should be raised; and after a date to be fixed no man should be\r\npermitted to assume the charge of a mine or become one of its officers\r\nwithout a proper certificate of competency from some recognised School\r\nof Mines or Technical College. The effect of such a regulation would in\r\na few years produce most beneficial results.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, whose “progressive” legislature I do not generally\r\ncommend, they have, in the matter of mine management, at all events,\r\ntaken a step in the right direction. There a mine manager, before he\r\nobtains his certificate, must have served at least two years\r\nunderground, and has to pass through a severe examination, lasting for\r\ndays, in all subjects relating to mining and machinery connected with\r\nmining. In addition, he must prove his capacity by making an underground\r\nsurvey, and then plotting his work. The examination is a stiff one, as\r\nmay be judged from the fact that between 1886 and 1891, only 27\r\ncandidates passed. Then the conditions were made easier, and from that\r\ndate to 1895, 19 passed. Of the 46 students who gained first-class\r\nhonours, 30 have left for South Africa or Australia, in both of which\r\ncountries New Zealand certificated men are held in high estimation.\r\n\r\nThe result of the establishment of our own School of Mines (Plate V.)\r\nhas been to raise the standard of the mine officer, whether manager,\r\nassayer, engineer, or “underground boss,” and our graduates have small\r\ndifficulty in obtaining positions both in the states of the Commonwealth\r\nand in South Africa. The building alone cost nearly £40,000, of which\r\n£15,000 was donated by the Hon. George Brookman, a successful mining\r\nman. The mining and metallurgical courses extend over a period of four\r\nyears. There are also facilities for students to gain higher\r\nqualifications, viz., the Fellowship in Mining, Metallurgy, Mechanical\r\nEngineering, or Electrical Engineering. The School works in conjunction\r\nwith the Adelaide University, each institution teaching the subjects for\r\nwhich it is specially qualified.\r\n\r\nBut returning to the formation of the Company, care should be taken in\r\nappointing Directors that at least one member of the Board is selected\r\non account of his special technical knowledge of mining, and others for\r\ntheir special business capacity. The ornamental men with high-sounding\r\nnames should not be required in legitimate ventures. Also, it is most\r\nimportant that the business Manager or Secretary should be a thoroughly\r\nqualified man, who by experience has learned what are the requirements\r\nof a mine doing a certain amount of work, so that a proper check may be\r\nkept on the expenses. The more Companies such a Secretary has in hand\r\nthe better, as one qualified man can supervise a large staff of clerks,\r\nwho would themselves be qualifying for similar work, and gaining a\r\nuseful and varied experience of mining business. An office of this\r\ndescription having charge of a large number of mines is, in its way, a\r\ntechnical school, and lads trained therein would be in demand as mine\r\npursers, a very responsible and necessary officer in a big mine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE V.--SOUTH AUSTRALIAN SCHOOL OF MINES AND\r\n    INDUSTRIES _To face p. 118_]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the men to whom the actual mining and treatment of ores\r\nand machinery is committed the greatest mistakes of the past have been\r\nthat too much has been required from one man. The Mining Manager has\r\nbeen expected to be a miner, metallurgist, engineer, and business man,\r\na combination not to be found probably in one man in a thousand. Such\r\nAdmirable Crichtons are rare in any profession or business, and that of\r\nmining is no exception. Men who profess too much are to be distrusted.\r\nYour best men are they who concentrate their energies and intellects\r\nin special directions. The Mining Manager should, if possible, be\r\nchosen from men holding certificates of competency from some technical\r\nmining school and, of course, should, in addition, have some practical\r\nexperience, not necessarily as Head Manager. He should understand\r\npractical mine surveying and calculation of quantities, be able to dial\r\nand plot out his workings, and prepare an intelligible plan thereof for\r\nthe use of the Directors, and should understand sufficient of physics,\r\nparticularly pneumatics and hydraulics, to ensure thoroughly efficient\r\npumping operations without loss of power from unnecessarily heavy\r\nappliances. Any other scientific knowledge applicable to his business\r\nwhich he may have acquired will tell in his favour, but he must, above\r\nall things, be a thoroughly practical man. Such men will in time be more\r\nreadily procurable, as students who have passed through the various\r\nSchools of Mines will be sent to learn their business practically at the\r\nmines just as we now, having given a lad a course of naval instruction,\r\nsend him to sea to learn the practical part of his life’s work.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, more is wanted on a mine than a man who can direct the\r\nsinking of shafts, driving of levels, and stoping of the lode. Much loss\r\nand disappointment have resulted in the past from unsuitable,\r\nineffective, or badly designed and erected machinery, whether for\r\nworking the mine or treating the ores. To obviate this defect a\r\nfirst-class mining engineer is required.\r\n\r\nThen, also, day by day we are more surely learning that mining in all\r\nits branches is a science, and that the treatment of ores and extraction\r\nof the metals is daily becoming more and more the work of the laboratory\r\nrather than of the rule-of-thumb procedure of the past. Every mine,\r\nwhether it be of gold, silver, tin, copper, or other metal, requires the\r\nsupervision of a thoroughly qualified metallurgist and chemist, and one\r\nwho is conversant with the newest processes for the extraction of the\r\nmetals from their ores and matrices.\r\n\r\nIt has then been stated that to ensure effective working each mine\r\nrequires, in addition to competent directors, a business-manager,\r\nmining-manager, and assistants, engineer, chemist, and metallurgist,\r\nwith assistant assayers, &c., all highly qualified men. But it will be\r\nasked, how are many struggling mines in sparsely populated countries to\r\nobtain the services of all these eminent scientists? The reply is by\r\nco-operation. One of the most ruinous mistakes of the past has been that\r\neach little mining venture has started on an independent course, with\r\ndifferent management, separate machinery, &c. Can it then be wondered at\r\nthat our gold-mining is not always successful?\r\n\r\nUnder a co-operative system all that each individual mine would require\r\nwould be a qualified, practical miner capable of opening and securing\r\nthe ground in a miner-like manner, and a good working engineer; and in\r\ngold-mining, where the gold is free in its matrix, a professional\r\namalgamator, or lixiviator. For the rest, half a dozen or more mines may\r\ncollectively retain the services of a mine manager of high attainments\r\nas general inspector and superintendent, and the same system could be\r\nadopted with respect to an advising metallurgist and an engineer. For\r\ngold, as indeed for other metals, a central extracting works, where the\r\nores could be scientifically treated in quantity, might be erected at\r\njoint cost, or might easily be arranged for as a separate business.\r\n\r\nA very fruitful cause of failure is the fatuous tendency of directors\r\nand mine managers to adopt new processes and inventions simply because\r\nthey are new. As an inventor in a small way myself, and one who is\r\nalways on the watch for improved methods, I do not wish to discourage\r\nintelligent progress; but the greatest care should be exercised by those\r\nhaving the control of the money of shareholders in mining properties\r\nbefore adopting any new machinery or process.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, and unfortunately shall see, many a promising mining\r\ncompany brought to grief by this popular error. The directors of mining\r\ncompanies might, to use an American saying, “paste this in their hats”\r\nas a useful and safe aphorism. “Let Others Do the Experimenting; We Are\r\nWilling to Pay Only For Proved Improvements.” I can cordially endorse\r\nevery word of the following extracts from Messrs. McDermott and\r\nDuffield’s admirable little work, “Losses in Gold Amalgamation.”\r\n\r\n    “Some directors of mining companies are naturally inclined to\r\n    listen to the specious promises of inventors of novel processes and\r\n    new machinery, forgetting their own personal disadvantage in any\r\n    argument on such matters, and assuming a confidence in the logic of\r\n    their own conclusions, while they ignore the fruitful experience of\r\n    thousands of practical men who are engaged in the mining business.\r\n    The repeated failures of directors in sending out new machinery to\r\n    their mines ought by this time to be a sufficient warning against\r\n    increasing risks that are at once natural and unavoidable, and\r\n    to deter them from plunging their shareholders into experiments\r\n    which, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, result in nothing but\r\n    excessive and needless expense.\r\n\r\n    “It is certain that new machines and new processes are, and will\r\n    be, given attention by mining men in proportion to their probable\r\n    merits; but the proper place for experiments is in a mill already\r\n    as successful as under known processes it can be made. In a new\r\n    enterprise, even when the expense of an experiment is undertaken by\r\n    the inventor, the loss to the mine-owner in case of failure must be\r\n    very great, both in time and general running expenses. Directors\r\n    should not believe that a willingness to risk cash in proving an\r\n    invention is necessarily any proof of value of the same; it is only\r\n    a measure of the faith of the inventor, which is hardly a safe\r\n    standard to risk shareholders’ money by.\r\n\r\n    “The variety of modifications in approved processes ought at\r\n    least to suggest the desirability of exhausting the known, before\r\n    drawing on the unknown and purely speculative. It should also be\r\n    borne in mind that what might appear at first sight to be new\r\n    processes, and even new machinery, are, in fact, often nothing but\r\n    old contrivances and plausible theories long ago exploded among\r\n    practical men.\r\n\r\n    “Many mining companies have been ruined, without any reference\r\n    to their mines, through men deciding on the reasonableness of new\r\n    process and machinery who have no knowledge of the business in\r\n    hand. It is assumed often, that if an inventor or manufacturer of\r\n    new machinery will agree to guarantee success, or take no pay if\r\n    not successful, the company takes no risk. In actual fact a whole\r\n    year is wasted in most cases, failure spoils the reputation of\r\n    the company, running expenses have continued, and further working\r\n    capital cannot be raised, because all concerned have lost confidence\r\n    by the failure to obtain returns promised. All this in addition\r\n    to the regular, unavoidable risks of mining itself, which may, at\r\n    any moment during the year lost, call for increased expenses and\r\n    increased faith in ultimate success. To the mining man who makes\r\n    money by the business, the natural risks of mining is all he will\r\n    take; it is sufficient; and when he invests more money in machinery\r\n    he takes good care that he takes no chances of either failure or\r\n    delay.\r\n\r\n    “The following are rules which no mining company or individual\r\n    mine-owner can afford to neglect.\r\n\r\n    “(1) The risk should be confined to mining. No body of directors\r\n    is justified in taking a shareholder’s money and investing it in new\r\n    processes or machinery when the subscription was simply for a mining\r\n    venture. Directors are invariably incapable of deciding whether a\r\n    so-called improvement in machinery or process is really so or not,\r\n    and the reasonable course is to follow established precedents.\r\n\r\n    “(2) The risk of selecting an incompetent manager should be\r\n    reduced to minimum by taking a man with a successful record in\r\n    the particular work to be done. The manager selected should be\r\n    prohibited, as much as the directors, from experimenting with new\r\n    methods or machinery. A really experienced man will require no check\r\n    in this direction, as he will not risk ruining his reputation.\r\n\r\n    “(3) The only time for a company to experiment is when the\r\n    mine is paying well by the usual methods, and the treasury is in a\r\n    condition to speculate a little in possible improvements without\r\n    jeopardising regular returns.”\r\n\r\nProbably this is the best place to insert another word of warning to\r\ndirectors who are not mining specialists, and also to investors in gold\r\nmining shares. Assays of auriferous lode material should always be\r\nchecked by the results of trials on large quantities. The reason is\r\nobvious. First, the prospector or company promoter is not in the least\r\nlikely to pick the worst piece of stone in the heap for assay; and,\r\nsecondly, even should the sample be selected with the sole object of\r\ngetting a fair result, no living man can judge the value of a gold lode\r\nby the result of treatment of an ounce of stone. So when it is reported\r\nthat a sample of rock from the Golden Mint Mine, Golconda, assays at the\r\nrate of 2,546 oz. 13 dwt. and 21 grs. to the ton, and that there are\r\nthousands of tons of similar stone in sight, the statement should be\r\nreceived with due caution. The assay is doubtless correct, but the\r\ndeductions therefrom are most misleading.\r\n\r\nA few words of advice also to directors of mine-purchasing companies and\r\nsyndicates, of which there are now so many in existence, may probably be\r\nfound of value. It is not good policy as a general rule to buy entirely\r\nundeveloped properties, unless such have been inspected by your own man,\r\nwho is both competent and trustworthy, and indeed who should have an\r\ninterest in the profits. Large areas, although so popular in England, do\r\nnot compensate for large bodies of payable ore; the most remunerative\r\nmine is generally one of comparatively small area, but containing a\r\nlarge lode formation of payable, but often low grade, ore.\r\n\r\nIt is worse still, of course, to buy a practically worked out mine,\r\nthough this too is sometimes done. It must be remembered that mining,\r\nthough often so profitable, is nevertheless a destructive industry, thus\r\ndiffering from agriculture, which is productive, and manufactures, which\r\nare constructive. Every ton of stone broken and treated from even the\r\nbest gold mine in the world makes that mine the poorer by one ton of\r\nvaluable material; thus, to buy a mining property on its past reputation\r\nfor productiveness is, as a rule, questionable policy, unless you know\r\nthere is sufficient good ore in sight to cover the purchase cost and\r\nleave a profit.\r\n\r\nThe point may be put thus: Human industry is (1) Productive, (2)\r\nConstructive, and (3) Destructive.\r\n\r\n(1) Productive.--Intelligent culture of the soil, including the\r\ndepasturage of profitable animals. This is the oldest.\r\n\r\n(2) Constructive.--The manufacture of raw products, animal, vegetable,\r\nand mineral, into articles of a necessary or æsthetic character.\r\n\r\n(3) Destructive.--Mining, in all its forms, because the natural stores\r\nof valuable minerals and metals won and used are not replaceable.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest causes of non-success of gold mining ventures,\r\nparticularly when worked by public companies, is the lack of actual\r\npersonal supervision, and hence, among other troubles, is that\r\nultra-objectionable one--gold stealing from the mills, or, in alluvial\r\nmining, from the tail races. As to the former, the following appeared in\r\n1893 in the London _Mining Journal_, and is, I think, worthy of the\r\nclose consideration of mine directors in all parts of the world:--\r\n\r\n    “No one that has not experienced the evil of gold thieving\r\n    from reduction mills can have any idea of the pernicious element\r\n    it is, and the difficulty, once that it has got ‘well hold,’ of\r\n    rooting it out. It permeates every class of society in the district\r\n    connected with the industry, and managers, amalgamators, assayers,\r\n    accountants, aye, even bank officials, are ‘all on the job’ to ‘get\r\n    a bit’ while there is an opportunity. To exterminate the hateful\r\n    monster requires on the part of the mine proprietors combined, stern\r\n    and drastic measures undertaken under the personal supervision of\r\n    one or more of their directors, and in many instances necessitating\r\n    the removal of the whole of the official staff.”\r\n\r\nThe writer narrates how about twenty-five years ago he was led to\r\nsuspect that in an Australian mine running forty head of stamps, in\r\nwhich he held a controlling interest, the owners were being defrauded of\r\nabout a fourth of the gold really contained in the ore, and the\r\nsuccessful steps taken to check the robbery.\r\n\r\n    “We first of all dispensed with the services of the general\r\n    manager, and then issued the following instructions to the mine and\r\n    mill managers, I remaining at the mine to see them carried out until\r\n    I substituted a practical local man as agent, who afterwards carried\r\n    on the work most efficiently:--\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Both of these officials to keep separate books and\r\n    accounts; in other words, to be distinct departments.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) The ore formerly was all thrown together and put through\r\n    the mill. I subdivided it into four classes, A, B, C, and D,\r\n    representing deep levels north and upper levels north, deep levels\r\n    south and upper levels south, and allotted to each class ten heads\r\n    of stamps at the mill.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) The mine manager to try three prospects, forenoon and\r\n    afternoon of each day, from the dumps of each of the four classes\r\n    and record in a book to be kept for that purpose the estimated mill\r\n    yield of each one.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) The mill manager was required to do the same at the mill\r\n    and keep his record.\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) There were four underground bosses in each shift, twelve\r\n    in all. I had a book fixed at the top of the shaft in which I\r\n    required each of these men, at the expiry of every shift, to record\r\n    any change in the faces of the quartz and particularly in regard to\r\n    quality.\r\n\r\n    “(_f_) Having divided the ore into four classes I instructed the\r\n    amalgamators, of which there were two in each shift, six in all,\r\n    that I required the amalgam from each to be kept separate, with the\r\n    object of ascertaining what each part of the mine produced.\r\n\r\n    “(_g_) I procured padlocks for the covering boards of the\r\n    mercury tables and gave the keys to the amalgamators with\r\n    instructions that they were not to hand them over to any one except\r\n    the exchange shift without my written authority, and instructed them\r\n    that they should clean down the plates every three hours, and after\r\n    cleaning down the amalgam, buckets to be placed in the cleaning\r\n    room, which I instructed to be kept locked and the key in charge of\r\n    a watchman night and day.\r\n\r\n    “(_h_) The whole of the amalgam taken from the plates during each\r\n    twenty-four hours to be cleaned and squeezed by the two amalgamators\r\n    on duty every forenoon at nine o’clock in the presence of the mill\r\n    manager, who should weigh each lot and enter it in a book to be kept\r\n    for the purpose, and the entry to be signed by the mill manager and\r\n    both amalgamators as witnesses.\r\n\r\n    “(_i_) Every alternate Friday the mortars (boxes) to be cleaned\r\n    out; the work to be commenced punctually at eight A.M. by the six\r\n    amalgamators in the presence of the mill manager, assisted by the\r\n    three amalgam cleaning room watchmen and the four battery feeders\r\n    on duty, prohibiting any of them from leaving until the cleaning up\r\n    was finished, and the amalgam cleaned, squeezed and weighed, and the\r\n    amount entered by the mill manager in the record book and attested\r\n    by the amalgamators.\r\n\r\n    “I think the intelligent readers (particularly those with\r\n    a knowledge of the business) will see the drift of the above\r\n    regulations, viz., for there to be any peculation the whole of the\r\n    battery staff--fourteen in all--would have to participate in it,\r\n    and the number was too many to keep a secret. Formerly the amalgam\r\n    cleaning room was sacred to the mill manager, and on announcing\r\n    to that official the new instructions he at once tendered his\r\n    resignation in a tone of offended dignity, immediately followed by\r\n    that of the mine manager. It is a significant fact that shortly\r\n    afterwards these two officials purchased a large mill and other\r\n    property at a cost of £10,000, and that the mine yielded for the\r\n    following three years during which I was connected with it an\r\n    average of over 17 dwt. to the ton, as against formerly 10 to 12 dwt.\r\n\r\n    “The reader must draw his own conclusions. I used to make it a\r\n    practice to visit the mine daily and prospect the ore, and having\r\n    the mine and mill managers’ daily prospecting as a guide as well\r\n    as my own, every man at the mill knew it was impossible for them\r\n    to thieve without my detecting it; moreover, I made it a rule to\r\n    discharge any of the mill employés that I discovered were interested\r\n    in any small private claims.\r\n\r\n    “The crux of the whole thing is having a practical miner at the\r\n    head of affairs, and it is impossible for him to thieve if the work\r\n    is carried out in the manner I have described.”\r\n\r\nTo bring the whole matter to a conclusion. It may be taken as a safe\r\naxiom that to make gold-mining in the mine as distinct from mining on\r\nthe Stock Exchange really profitable the same system of economy, of\r\npractical supervision, and scientific knowledge which is now adopted in\r\nall other businesses must be applied to the raising and extraction of\r\nthe metal. Then, and not till then, will genuine mining take the place\r\nto which it is entitled amongst our industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n    RULES OF THUMB\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter has been headed as above because a number of the rules and\r\nrecipes given are simply practical expedients, not too closely\r\nscientific. My endeavour has been to supply practical and useful\r\ninformation in language as free from technicalities as possible, so as\r\nto adapt it to the ordinary miner, mill operator and prospector, many of\r\nwhom have had no scientific training. Some of the expedients are\r\noriginal devices educed by necessity, which, we are told, is the mother\r\nof invention; others are hints given by practical old prospectors who\r\nhad met with difficulties that would be the despair of a man brought up\r\nwithin reach of forge, foundry, machine shop, or tradesmen generally.\r\nThere are many highly ingenious and useful contrivances besides these I\r\nhave given.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIVING PLACES\r\n\r\nThe health of the prospector, especially in a new country, depends\r\nlargely on his housing--in which particular many men are foolishly\r\ncareless, for although they are aware that they will be camped out for\r\nlong periods, yet all the shelter they rely on is a miserable calico\r\ntent, often without a “fly,” while in some cases they sometimes even\r\nsleep on the wet, or dusty, ground. Such persons fully deserve the ill\r\nhealth which sooner or later overtakes them. A little forethought and\r\nvery moderate ingenuity would render their camp comparatively healthy\r\nand comfortable.\r\n\r\nIn summer a tent is the hottest, and in winter the coldest of domiciles.\r\nThe “pizie” or “adobie” hut, or, where practicable, the “dugout” are\r\nmuch to be preferred, especially the latter. “Pizie” or “adobie” is\r\nsimply surface soil kneaded with water and either moulded between\r\nboards like concrete, to construct the walls, or made into large\r\nsun-dried bricks. Salt water should not be used, as it causes the wall\r\nto be affected by every change of weather. A properly constructed house\r\nof this material, where the walls are protected by overhanging eaves, is\r\npractically everlasting, and some have been standing for centuries.\r\nThere are buildings of pizie or adobie in Mexico, California, and\r\nAustralia which are as good as new, although the latter were built\r\nnearly a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nAdobie dwellings are warm in winter, cool in summer, and clean and\r\nhealthy if occasionally whitewashed.\r\n\r\nThe dugout is even more simple in construction. A cutting, say ten feet\r\nwide, is put into the base of a hill for, say, twelve feet until the\r\nback wall is, say, ten feet high, the sides starting from nothing to\r\nthat height. The front and such portion as is required of the side walls\r\nare next constructed of pizie or rough stone, with mud mortar, and the\r\nroof either gabled or skillion of bough, grass, or reed thatch, and\r\ncovered with pizie, over which is sometimes put another thin layer of\r\nthatch to prevent the pizie being washed away by heavy rain. Nothing can\r\nbe more snug and comfortable than such a house, unless the cows, as Mark\r\nTwain narrates, make things “monotonous” by persistently tumbling down\r\nthe chimney.\r\n\r\nWhen the Burra copper mines were in full work in South Australia sixty\r\nyears ago, the banks of the Burra Creek were honeycombed like a rabbit\r\nwarren with the “dugout” homes of the Cornish miners. The ruins of these\r\nold dugouts now extend for miles, and look something like an uncovered\r\nPompeii.[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] This wonderful copper occurrence has lately been revived\r\n    by the discovery of rich and strong lode formations outside the\r\n    formerly worked portions.\r\n\r\nWhen water is scarce and the tent has to be retained, much can be done\r\nto make the camp snug. I occupied a very comfortable camp once, of which\r\nmy then partner, a Dane, was the architect. We called it “The Bungalow,”\r\nand it was constructed as follows: First we set up our tent, 10 ft. by 8\r\nft., formed of green baize-lined calico, and covered with a well set fly\r\n(Fig. 27).\r\n\r\nNext we put in four substantial forked posts about 10 ft. high and 15\r\nft. apart, with securely fixed cross pieces, and on the top was laid a\r\nrough flat roof of brush thatch; the sides were then treated in the same\r\nway, but not so thickly, being merely intended as a breakwind.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 27. CALICO TENT WITH FLY.]\r\n\r\nThe ground plan was as shown in Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe tent with its two comfortable bunks was placed a little to one side,\r\nthe remaining space being used as a dining and sitting room all through\r\nthe summer. Except in occasional seasons of heavy rain, when we were\r\nsaved the trouble of washing our dishes, the tent was only used for\r\nsleeping purposes, and as a storehouse for clothes and perishable\r\nprovisions. I have “dwelt in marble halls” since then, but never was\r\nfood sweeter or sleep sounder than in the old bush bungalow.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A BUSH BED.\r\n\r\nTo make a comfortable bush bedplace, take four forked posts about 3 ft.\r\n6 in. long and 2 to 3 in. in diameter at the top; mark out your bedplace\r\naccurately and put a post at each corner, about 1 ft. in the ground.\r\nTake two poles about 7 ft. long, and having procured two strong\r\nfive-bushel corn sacks, cut holes in the bottom corners, put the poles\r\nthrough, bringing the mouths of the sacks together, and secure them\r\nthere with a strong stitch or two. Put your poles on the upright forked\r\nsticks, and you have a couch that even Sancho Panza would have envied.\r\nIt is as well to fix stretchers or cross stays between the posts at head\r\nand foot (Fig. 29).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 29. BUSH STRETCHER.]\r\n\r\nIn malarial countries, sleeping on the ground is distinctly dangerous,\r\nand as such districts are usually thickly timbered, the Northern\r\nTerritory hammock is an admirable device, more particularly where\r\nmosquitoes abound.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NORTHERN TERRITORY HAMMOCK.\r\n\r\nThis hammock, which is almost a standing bedplace when rigged, is\r\nconstructed as follows:--To a piece of strong canvas 7 feet long and\r\n2½ feet wide, put a broad hem, say 3½ inches wide at each end.\r\nInto this hem run a tough stick, about 2 feet 8 inches long by 1½\r\ninches diameter. Round the centre of the stick pass a piece of strong\r\nthree-quarter inch rope, 8 to 10 feet long and knot it, so as to leave a\r\nshort end in which a metal eye is inserted. To each end of the two\r\nsticks a piece of quarter-inch lashing, about 6 feet long, is securely\r\nattached (Fig. 30).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 30. NORTHERN TERRITORY HAMMOCK.]\r\n\r\nTo make the mosquito covering take 18 feet of ordinary strong cheese\r\ncloth, and two pieces of strong calico of the same size as the canvas\r\nbed; put hems in the ends of the upper one large enough to take\r\nhalf-inch sticks, to all four extremities of which 8 feet of whipcord is\r\nto be attached. The calico forms the top and bottom of what we used to\r\ncall the “meat safe,” the sides being of cheese cloth. A small, flapped\r\nopening is left on the lower side. When once inside you are quite safe\r\nfrom mosquito bites.\r\n\r\nTo rig the above, two trees are chosen 7 to 8 feet apart, or two stayed\r\npoles can be erected if no trees are available. The bed is rigged about\r\n3 feet from the ground by taking the rope round the trees or poles, and\r\npulling the canvas taut by means of the metal eyelet. Then the lashings\r\nat the extremities of the sticks are fixed about 3 feet further up the\r\ntrees and you have a bed something between a hammock and a standing bed.\r\nThe mosquito net is fixed above the hammock in a similar manner, except\r\nthat it does not require the centre stay (Fig. 31).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 31. NORTHERN TERRITORY HAMMOCK (SET UP).]\r\n\r\nAn old friend of mine once had a rather startling experience which\r\ncaused him to swear by the Northern Territory hammock. He was camped\r\nnear the banks of a muddy creek on the Daly River, and had fortunately\r\nhung his “meat safe” about four feet high. The night was very dark, and\r\nsome hours after retiring he heard a crash among his tin camp utensils,\r\nand the noise of some animal moving below him. Thinking his visitor was\r\na stray “dingo,” or wild dog, he gave a yell to frighten the brute away,\r\nand hearing it go, he calmly went to sleep again. Had he known who his\r\ncaller really was, he would not have felt so comfortable. In the morning\r\non the damp ground below, he found the tracks of a fourteen foot\r\nalligator, which was also out prospecting, but which, fortunately, had\r\nnot thought of investigating the “meat safe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    PURIFYING WATER.\r\n\r\nThere is not a more fertile disease distributor, particularly in a new\r\ncountry, than water. The uninitiated generally take it for granted that\r\nso long as water looks clear it is necessarily pure and wholesome; as a\r\nmatter of fact the contrary is more usually the case, except in very\r\nwell watered countries, and such, as a rule, are not those in which gold\r\nis most plentifully got by the average prospector. I have seen foolish\r\nfellows, who were parched with a long tramp, drink water in quantity in\r\nwhich living organisms could be seen with the naked eye, without taking\r\neven the ordinary precaution of straining it through a piece of linen.\r\nIf they contracted hydatids, typhoid fever, or other ailments, which\r\nthin our mining camps of the strong, lusty, careless youths, who could\r\nwonder?\r\n\r\nThe best of all means of purifying water from organic substances is to\r\nboil it. If it should be very bad, add carbon in the form of the\r\ncharcoal from your camp fire. If it be thick, you may, with advantage,\r\nadd a little of the ash also.\r\n\r\nI once rode forty-five miles with nearly beaten horses to a native well,\r\nor rock hole, to find water, the next stage being over fifty miles\r\nfarther. The well was found, but the water in it was very bad; for in it\r\nwas the body of a dead kangaroo, which had apparently been there for\r\nweeks. The wretched horses, half frantic with thirst, did manage to\r\ndrink a few mouthfuls, but we could not. I filled our largest billycan,\r\nholding about two gallons, slung it over the fire and added, as the wood\r\nburnt down, charcoal, till the top was covered to a depth of two inches.\r\nWith the charcoal there was, of course, a little ash containing\r\nbi-carbonate of potassium. The effect was marvellous. So soon as the\r\nhorrible soup came to the boil, the impurities coagulated, and after\r\nkeeping it at boiling temperature for about a quarter of an hour, it was\r\nremoved from the fire, the cinders skimmed out, and the water allowed to\r\nsettle, which it did very quickly. It was then decanted off into an\r\nordinary prospector’s pan, and some was used to make tea (the flavour of\r\nwhich can be better imagined than described); the remainder was allowed\r\nto stand all night, a few pieces of charcoal being added. In the morning\r\nit was bright, clear, and absolutely sweet. This experience is worth\r\nknowing, as many a bad attack of typhoid and other fevers would be\r\naverted if practical precautions of this kind were but used.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO OBTAIN WATER FROM ROOTS.\r\n\r\nThe greatest necessity of animal life is water. There are, however, vast\r\nareas of the earth’s surface where this most precious element is\r\nlamentably lacking, and such, unfortunately, is the case in many rich\r\nauriferous districts.\r\n\r\nTo the practical man there are many indications of water. These, of\r\ncourse, vary in different countries. Sometimes it is the herbage, but,\r\nprobably, the best of all is the presence of carnivorous animals and\r\nbirds. These are never found far from water. In Australia the not\r\nover-loved wily old crow is a pretty sure indicator of water within\r\nreasonable distance--water may be extracted from the roots of the Mallee\r\n(_Eucalyptus dumosa_ and _gracilis_)--the Box (_Eucalyptus hemiphloia_)\r\nand the Water Bush (_Hakea leucoptera_). To extract it the roots are dug\r\nup, cut into lengths of about a foot, and placed upright in a can; the\r\nlower ends being a few inches above the bottom. It is simply astonishing\r\nhow much wholesome, if at times somewhat astringent, water may thus be\r\nobtained in a few hours, particularly at night.\r\n\r\n_Hakea leucoptera._ “Pins and needles.”--Maiden, in his work “Useful\r\nNative Plants of Australia,” says: “In an experiment on a water-yielding\r\n_Hakea_, the first root, about half an inch in diameter and six or eight\r\nfeet long, yielded quickly, and in large drops about a wine-glass full\r\nof really excellent water.”\r\n\r\nThis valuable, though not particularly ornamental shrub (for it never\r\nattains to the dimensions of a tree), is found, to the best of my\r\nbelief, in all parts of Australia, although it is said to be absent\r\nfrom West Australia. As to this, I don’t feel quite sure. I have seen\r\nit “from the centre to the sea” as far west as Streaky Bay, and believe\r\nI have seen it farther west still. Considering the great similarity of\r\nmuch of the flora of South Africa to that of Australia, it is probable\r\nthat some species of the water-bearing _Hakea_ may be found there. It\r\ncan readily be recognised by its acicular, needle-like leaves, and more\r\nparticularly by its peculiarly shaped seed vessel, which resembles the\r\npattern on an old-fashioned Indian shawl (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\nIf the water found is too impure for drinking purposes and the trouble\r\narises from visible animalculæ only, straining through a\r\npocket-handkerchief is better than nothing; the carbon filter is better\r\nstill; but nothing is so effective as boiling. A carbon filter is a tube\r\nwith a wad of compressed carbon inserted, through which the water is\r\nsucked. As a rule clay-coloured water is comparatively innocuous, but\r\nbeware of the bright, limpid water of long stagnant rock water-holes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 32. SEED-VESSEL OF HAKEA LEUCOPTERA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE FILTER.\r\n\r\nTake a nail-can, keg, cask, or any other vessel, or even an ordinary\r\nwooden case (well tarred inside, if possible, to make it water-tight).\r\nMake a hole or several holes in the bottom, and set it over a tank or\r\nbucket. Into the bottom of the filter put (1) a few inches of washed\r\nbroken stone; (2) about four inches of charcoal; (3) say three inches of\r\nclean coarse sand (if not to hand you can manufacture it by crushing\r\nquartz with your pestle and mortar), and (4) alternate layers of\r\ncharcoal and sand until the vessel is half filled. Fill the top half\r\nwith water, and renew from time to time, and you have a filter which is\r\nas effective as the best London made article. _But it is better to boil\r\nyour water whether you filter afterwards or not._\r\n\r\nClear the inside of the water-cask frequently, and occasionally add to\r\nthe water a little Condy’s fluid, as it destroys organic matter. A\r\nuseful cement for stopping leaky places in casks is made as follows;\r\nTallow 25 parts, lard 40 parts, sifted wood ash 25 parts. Mix together\r\nby heating, and apply with a knife blade which has just been heated.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CANVAS WATER BAGS.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 33. CANVAS WATER BAG.]\r\n\r\nAre easily made, and are very handy for carrying small supplies of\r\ndrinking-water when prospecting in a dry country; they having the\r\nadvantage of keeping the water cool in the hottest weather, by reason of\r\nthe evaporation. The mouthpiece is made of the neck of a bottle securely\r\nsewn in (Fig. 33).\r\n\r\n\r\n    MEDICINE CASE.\r\n\r\nMedicine is also a matter well worthy of thought. The author’s worst\r\nenemy would not call him a mollycoddle, yet he has never travelled in\r\nfar wilds without carrying something in the way of medicine. First,\r\nthen, on this subject, it cannot be too often reiterated that if common\r\nEpsom salts were a guinea an ounce instead of a penny the medicine would\r\nbe valued accordingly, but it is somewhat bulky. What I specially\r\nrecommend, however, is a small pocket-case of the more commonly known\r\nhomoeopathic remedies, “Mother tinctures,” or first dilutions, which\r\nare small, light, and portable, with a small simple book of\r\ninstructions. Though generally an allopath in practice, I once saved my\r\nown life, and have certainly helped others by a little knowledge in\r\ndiagnosing complaints and having simple homoeopathic remedies at hand\r\nto be used in the first stages of what might otherwise have been serious\r\nillnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRODUCING FIRE.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard, and most believe, that fire may be easily produced\r\nby rubbing together two pieces of wood. I have seen it done by\r\naboriginals, but they seldom make use of the operation, which is\r\ngenerally laborious, preferring to carry lighted fire sticks for miles.\r\nI have never succeeded in the experiment.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, it is almost a matter of life or death to be able to\r\nproduce fire. The back of a pocket knife, or an old file with a fragment\r\nof flint, quartz, or pyrites struck smartly together over the remains of\r\na burnt piece of calico, will in deft hands produce a spark which can be\r\nfanned to a glow, and so ignite other material, till a fire is produced.\r\n\r\nAlso it may not be generally known that he who carries a watch has a\r\n“burning glass” with which he can, in clear weather, produce fire at\r\nwill. All that is required is to remove the glass of your watch and\r\ncarefully three parts fill it with water (salt or fresh). This forms a\r\nlens which, held steadily, will easily ignite any light, dry,\r\ninflammable substance.\r\n\r\nWhen firearms are carried, cut a cartridge so that only about a quarter\r\nof the charge of powder remains. Damp some powder and rub it on a small\r\npiece of dry cotton cloth or well-rubbed brown paper. Push a loose\r\npellet of this into the barrel, insert your half cartridge, fire at the\r\nground, when the wad will readily ignite, and can be blown into flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO COPY CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe prospector is not usually a business man; hence in dealing with\r\nbusiness men who, like Hamlet, are “indifferent honest,” he frequently\r\ncomes to grief through not having a copy of his correspondence. It is\r\nmost desirable, therefore, either to carry a carbon paper duplicating\r\nbook and a stylus, or by adding a little sugar to good ordinary black\r\nink you may make a copying ink; then with the aid of a “yellow back”\r\noctavo novel, two pieces of board, and some ordinary tissue paper, you\r\nmay take a copy of any letter you send.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE TELEGRAPHIC CODE.\r\n\r\nBuy a couple of cheap small dictionaries of the same edition, send one\r\nto your correspondent with an intimation that he is to read up or down\r\nso many words from the one indicated when receiving a message. Thus, if\r\nI want to say “Claim is looking well,” I take a shilling dictionary,\r\nsend a copy thereof to my correspondent with the intimation that the\r\nreal word is seven down, and telegraph--“Civilian looking weird;” this,\r\nif looked up in Worcester’s little pocket dictionary, for instance, will\r\nread “Claim looking well.” Any dictionary will do so long as both\r\nparties have a copy and understand which is the right word. By\r\narrangement this plan can be varied from time to time if you have any\r\nidea that your code can be read by others.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A SERVICEABLE SOAP.\r\n\r\nWood ashes from the camp fire are boiled from day to day in a small\r\nquantity of water, and allowed to settle, the clear liquid being\r\ndecanted off. When the required quantity of weak lye has been\r\naccumulated, evaporate by boiling, till a sufficient degree of strength\r\nhas been obtained. Now melt down some mutton fat, and, while hot, add to\r\nthe boiling lye. Continue boiling and stirring till the mixture is about\r\nthe consistency of thick porridge, pour into any convenient flat vessel,\r\nand let it stand till cool. If you have any resin in store, a little\r\npowdered and added gradually to the melting tallow, before mixing with\r\nthe lye, will stiffen your soap.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO CROSS A FLOODED STREAM.\r\n\r\nTake a half-gallon, or larger, tin “billy can,” enclose it in a strong\r\ncotton handkerchief or cotton cloth, knotting same over the lid, invert,\r\nand, taking the knot in the hand, you have a floating appliance which\r\nwill sustain you in any water, whether you are a swimmer or not. The\r\nhigh silk hat of civilisation would act as well as the can, but these\r\nare not usually found far afield.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO MAKE A HIDE BUCKET.\r\n\r\nAt times when prospecting in an “incline” or “underlay” shaft,\r\nparticularly where the walls of the lode are irregular, a hide bucket\r\nwill be found preferable to an iron one. The mode of manufacture is as\r\nfollows: Procure an ox hide, “green,” if possible; if dry, it should be\r\nsoaked until quite soft. Cut some thin strips of hide for sewing or\r\nlacing. Now shape a bag or pocket of size sufficient to hold about a\r\nhundred-weight of stone, and by puncturing the edges with a knife,\r\nmarline-spike, or other pointed tool, sew together; make a handle of\r\ntwisted or pleated hide, and having filled your bucket with dry sand or\r\nearth let it stand till the whole is quite dry, when it will be properly\r\ndistended and will maintain its shape until worn out.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO MAKE A “SLUSH LAMP.”\r\n\r\nWhere candles are scarce and kerosine is not, a “slush lamp” is a useful\r\nsubstitute. Take an old but sound quart tin pannikin, half fill it with\r\nsand or earth, and prepare a thin stick of pine, round which wrap a\r\nstrip of soft cotton cloth. The stick should be about half an inch\r\nlonger than the depth of the pannikin. Melt some waste fat, fill the\r\npannikin therewith, push the stick down into the earth at the bottom,\r\nand you have a light, which, if not equal to the electric or\r\nincandescent gas burner, is quite serviceable. In Australia the soft\r\nvelvety core of the “bottle brush” or honeysuckle tree, _Banksia\r\nmarginata_, is often used instead of the cotton wick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n    RULES OF THUMB\r\n\r\n    MINING APPLIANCES AND METHODS\r\n\r\n    A TEMPORARY FORGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat prospector has not at times been troubled for the want of a forge?\r\nTo steel or harden a pick, or sharpen a drill is comparatively easy, but\r\nthere is often a difficulty in getting a forge. Big single action\r\nbellows are sometimes bought at great expense, and some ingenious\r\nfellows have made an imitation of the blacksmith’s bellows by means of\r\nsheepskins and rough boards.\r\n\r\nWith inadequate material and appliances to hand, the following will be\r\nfound easier to construct and more lasting when constructed. Only a\r\nsingle piece of iron is required, and, at a pinch, one could even\r\ndispense with that by using a slab of talcose material, roughly shaping\r\na hearth therein and making a hole for the blast. First, construct a\r\nframing about the height of an ordinary smith’s forge. This can be made\r\nwith saplings and bark, or better still, if available, out of an empty\r\npacking case about three feet square. Fill the frame or case with\r\nslightly damped earth and ram it tight, leaving the usual hollow hearth.\r\nThen form a chamber below the perforated hearth opening to the rear. Now\r\nconstruct a centrifugal fan, such as is used for the ventilation of\r\nshallow shafts and workings. Set this up behind the hearth and revolve\r\nby means of a wooden multiplying wheel. A piece of ordinary washing line\r\nrope, or sash line rope, well resined if resin can be got--but pitch,\r\ntar, or wax will do by adding a little fine dust to prevent sticking--is\r\nused as a belt. With very rough materials a handy man can thus make a\r\nforge that will answer ordinary requirements.--N.B. Do not use clay for\r\nyour hearth bed unless you can get a highly aluminous clay, and can give\r\nit full time to dry before the forge fire is lit. Ordinary surface soil,\r\nnot too sandy, acts well, if damped and rammed thoroughly. Of course, if\r\nyou can get an iron nozzle for your blower the whole operation is\r\nsimplified.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SIMPLE WAY OF MAKING CHARCOAL.\r\n\r\nDig a pit 5 feet square by 3 feet deep and fill with fuel. After\r\nlighting, see that the pit is kept full. The hot embers will gradually\r\nsink to the bottom. The fuel should be kept burning fiercely until the\r\npit seems almost full, when more fuel should be added, raising the heap\r\nabout a foot above the level of the ground. The earth dug out of the pit\r\nshould then be shovelled back over the burning mass. After leaving it to\r\ncool for 24 hours the pit will be found nearly full of charcoal. About\r\none-quarter the weight of the dry fuel used should be recovered in\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROUGH SMELTING ON THE MINE.\r\n\r\nRough gold smelting on the mine is effected with a flux of borax,\r\ncarbonate of soda, or, as I have often done, with some powdered white\r\nglass. When the gold is smelted and the flux has settled down quietly in\r\na liquid state, the bulk of the latter may be removed, to facilitate\r\npouring into the mould, by dipping an iron rod alternately into the flux\r\nand then into a little water, and knocking off the ball of congealed\r\nflux which adheres after each dip. This flux should, however, be crushed\r\nwith a pestle and mortar and panned off, as, in certain cases, it may\r\ncontain tiny globules of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MISFIRES IN BLASTING.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common sources of accident in mining operations is due\r\neither to carelessness or to the use of defective material in blasting.\r\nA shot misses, generally for one of two reasons; either the explosive,\r\nthe cap, or the fuse (most often the latter), is inferior or defective;\r\nor the charging is incompetently performed. Sometimes the fuse is not\r\nplaced properly in the detonator, or the detonator is not properly\r\nenclosed in the cartridge, or the fuse is injured by improper tamping.\r\nIf several shots have been fired together, particularly at the change of\r\na “shift,” the men who have to remove the broken material may in so\r\ndoing explode the missed charge. Or, more inexcusable still, men will\r\noften be so foolish as to try to clear out the drill hole and remove the\r\nmissed cartridge. When a charge is known to have missed all that is\r\nnecessary to do in order to discharge it safely is to remove a few\r\ninches of “tamping” from the top of the drill hole, place in the bore a\r\nplug of dynamite with cap and fuse attached, put an inch or two of\r\ntamping over it and fire, when the missed charge will also be exploded.\r\nOf course, judgment must be used and the depth of the drill taken into\r\nconsideration. As a rule, miners use far more tamping than is at all\r\nrequisite. The action of the charge will generally be found quite as\r\neffective with a few inches of covering matter as with a foot or more,\r\nwhile the exploding of misfire cartridges is rendered simple, as no\r\nremoval of tamping is required before placing the top “plug” in case of\r\nmisfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO PREVENT LOSS OF RICH SPECIMENS IN BLASTING.\r\n\r\nWhen blasting the cap of a lode, particularly on rich shutes of gold,\r\nthe rock is apt to fly, and rich specimens may be thrown far afield and\r\nso be lost. A simple way of avoiding this is to procure a quantity of\r\nboughs, which tie into loose bundles, placing the leafy parts\r\nalternately end for end. Before firing, pile these bundles over the\r\nblast and, if care is used, very few stones will fly. The same device\r\nmay be used in wide shallow shafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A SIMPLE MODE OF RETORTING SMALL QUANTITIES OF AMALGAM.\r\n\r\nClean your amalgam and squeeze it as hard as possible through strong\r\ncalico or chamois leather. Take a large sound potato, cut off about a\r\nquarter from one end and scoop out a hole in the centre about twice as\r\nbig as the ball of amalgam. Procure a piece of flat iron--an old spade\r\nwill do as well as anything--insert the amalgam, and, having placed the\r\npotato, cut side downwards, thereon, put the plate of iron on the forge,\r\nheat up first gently, then stronger, till separation has taken place,\r\nwhen the gold will be found in a bright clean button on the plate and\r\nthe mercury in fine globules in the potato, from which it can be\r\nre-collected by breaking up the partly or wholly cooked tuber under\r\nwater in an enamelled or ordinary crockery basin. It is as well to place\r\na piece of paper between the iron and the amalgam to prevent adhesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO RETORT SMALL QUANTITIES OF MERCURY FOR AMALGAMATING ASSAY TESTS.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 34. SMOKING-PIPE RETORT.]\r\n\r\nGet two new tobacco pipes similar in shape (Fig. 34), with the biggest\r\nbowls and longest stems procurable. Break off the stem of one close to\r\nthe bowl and fill the hole with well worked clay (some battery slimes\r\nmake the best luting clay). Set the stemless pipe on end in a clay bed,\r\nand fill with amalgam, pass a bit of thin iron or copper wire beneath\r\nit, and bend the ends of the wire upwards. Now fit the whole pipe, bowl\r\ninverted, on to the under one, luting the edges of both well with clay.\r\nTwist the wire over the top with a pair of nippers till the two bowls\r\nare fitted closely together, and you have a retort that will stand any\r\nheat necessary to thoroughly distil mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A SIMPLE MODE OF ASCERTAINING THE NOMINAL HORSE-POWER OF AN\r\n    ENGINE.\r\n\r\nMultiply the internal diameter of the cylinder by itself and strike off\r\nthe last figure of the quotient. The diameter is\r\n\r\n     20” × 20”\r\n     20\r\n    -----\r\n     40ø.    The H.P. is 40.\r\n\r\nThe following rules will be found more professionally accurate from an\r\nengineering standpoint, though the term “horse-power” is not now\r\ngenerally employed.\r\n\r\n_To find the Nominal Horse-power._--For _non-condensing_ engines:\r\nMultiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inches by 7 and\r\ndivide the product by 80. For _condensing_ engines: Multiply the square\r\nof the diameter of the cylinder in inches by 7 and divide the product by\r\n200.\r\n\r\n_To find the Actual Horse-power_ of an engine, multiply the area of the\r\ncylinder in square inches by the average effective pressure in pounds\r\nper square inch, less 3 lb. per square inch as the frictional allowance,\r\nand also by the speed of the piston in feet per minute, dividing the\r\nproduct by 33,000, and the quotient will be the actual horse-power.\r\n\r\n\r\n     “SCALING” COPPER PLATES.\r\n\r\nTo “scale” copper plates they may be put over a charcoal or coke fire to\r\nslowly sublimate the quicksilver. Where possible, the fireplace of a\r\nspare boiler can be utilised, using a thin red fire. After the entire\r\nevaporation of the quicksilver the plates should be slowly cooled,\r\nrubbed with hydrochloric acid, and put in a damp place overnight, then\r\nrubbed with a solution of sal ammoniac and nitre in equal parts, and\r\nagain heated slowly over a red fire. They must not be allowed to get red\r\nhot; the proper degree of heat is indicated by the gold scale rising in\r\nblisters, when the plates are to be taken from the fire and the gold\r\nscraped off. Any part of the plate on which the gold has not blistered\r\nshould be again rubbed with the solution and fired. The gold scale\r\nshould be collected in a glass or earthen dish and covered with nitric\r\nacid, till all the copper is dissolved, when the gold can be smelted in\r\nthe usual way; but when it is molten, corrosive sublimate should be put\r\nin the crucible till a blue flame ceases to be given off.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A Second Method._\r\n\r\nThe simplest plan I know is to have a hole dug nine inches deep by about\r\nthe size of the plate to be scaled; place a brick at each corner, and on\r\neach side, halfway between. Get up a good fire, and let it burn down to\r\nstrong embers, or use charcoal, then place the plate on three bars of\r\niron extending between the three pairs of bricks, have a strong solution\r\nof borax ready in which soak strips of old “table blanket,” laying these\r\nover the plate and sprinkling them with the borax solution when the\r\nplate gets too hot. After a time the deposit of mercury and gold on the\r\nplate will assume a white, efflorescent appearance, and may then be\r\nreadily parted from the copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Another Method._\r\n\r\nHeat the plate over an open fire, to drive off the mercury; after which,\r\nlet it cool, and saturate with dilute sulphuric acid for three hours, or\r\nlonger; then sprinkle over the surface a mixture of equal parts of\r\ncommon salt and sal ammoniac, and heat to redness. When cool, the gold\r\nscale comes off freely; the scale is then boiled in nitric or sulphuric\r\nacid, to remove the copper, previous to melting. Plates may be scaled\r\nabout once in six months, and will under ordinary circumstances produce\r\nabout one ounce of clean gold for each superficial foot of copper\r\nsurface employed. I always paint the back of the plate with a mixture of\r\nboiled oil and turpentine, or beeswax dissolved in turpentine, to\r\nprevent the acid attacking the copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n     HOW TO SUPPLY MERCURY TO MORTAR BOXES.\r\n\r\nI am indebted for the following to Mr. J. M. Drake, who, speaking of his\r\nexperience on the Wentworth Mine, N.S.W., says:--\r\n\r\n     “Fully 90 per cent. of the gold is saved on the outside\r\n     plates, only a small quantity remaining in the mortar. The plates\r\n     have a slope of 2 in. to 1 ft. No wells are used, the amalgam\r\n     traps saving any quicksilver which may leach off the plates. The\r\n     quicksilver is added every hour in the mortar. The quantity is\r\n     regulated by the mill manager in the following manner: Three pieces\r\n     of wood, 8 in. wide by 12 in. long by 2 in. thick, have 32 holes\r\n     1 in. deep bored in each of them. These holes will just take a\r\n     small 2 oz. phial. The mill manager puts the required quantity of\r\n     quicksilver in each bottle and the batteryman empties one bottle in\r\n     each mortar every hour; and puts it back in its hole upside down.\r\n     Each block of wood lasts eight hours, the duration of one man’s\r\n     shift.” This of course is for a 20-head mill with four mortars or\r\n     “boxes.”\r\n\r\nI commend this as an excellent mode of supplying the mercury\r\nto the boxes or mortars. The quantity to be added depends on\r\ncircumstances. A careless battery attendant will often put in too\r\nmuch or too little when working without the automatic feeder.\r\nI have known an attendant on suddenly awaking to the fact half\r\nthrough his shift, that he had forgotten to put in any mercury,\r\nto then empty into the stamper box two or three pounds weight;\r\nwith what effect may be easily surmised.\r\n\r\n\r\n     HOW WATER SHOULD ENTER STAMPER BOXES.\r\n\r\nThe following extract which relates to Californian Gold Mill practices\r\nis from Bulletin No. 6 of the California State Mining Bureau. I quite\r\nagree with the practice.\r\n\r\n    “The battery water should enter both sides of the mortar in an\r\n    even quantity, and should be sufficient to keep a fairly thick\r\n    pulp which will discharge freely through the grating or screen.\r\n    About 120 cubic feet of water per ton of crushed ore may be\r\n    considered an average, or 8 to 10 cubic feet per stamp per hour.\r\n\r\n    “Screens of different materials and with different orifices are\r\n    used; the materials comprise wire cloth of brass or steel, tough\r\n    Russian sheet iron, English tinned plate, and, quite recently,\r\n    aluminium bronze. The ‘aluminium bronze’ plates are much longer\r\n    lived than either of the other kinds, and have the further\r\n    advantage that, when worn out, they can be sold for the value of\r\n    the metal for remelting; these plates are bought and sold by the\r\n    pound, and are said to contain 95 per cent. of copper and 5 per\r\n    cent. of aluminium. Steel screens are not so much used, on\r\n    account of their liability to rust.”\r\n\r\nI have had no experience with the aluminium bronze screen. I presume,\r\nhowever, that it is used only for mills where mercury is not put in the\r\nmortars, otherwise it would surely become amalgamated. The same remark\r\napplies to brass wire cloth and tinned plate. Unless the metal of which\r\nthey are composed will not readily amalgamate with mercury, I should be\r\nchary of using new screen devices. Mercury is a most insidious metal and\r\nis often found most unexpectedly in places in the battery where it\r\nshould not be. Probably aluminium steel would be better than any\r\nsubstance mentioned. It would be hard, light, strong, and not readily\r\ncorrodible. I am not aware if it has been tried.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of “Power for Mills” the following is taken from the\r\nsame source.\r\n\r\n\r\n     POWER FOR MILLS.\r\n\r\n    “As the Pelton wheel seems to find the most frequent application\r\n    in California, it may be convenient for millmen to have the\r\n    following rule, applicable to these wheels:\r\n\r\n    “When the head of water is known in feet, multiply it by\r\n    0·0024147, and the product is the horse-power obtainable from one\r\n    miner’s inch of water.\r\n\r\n    “The power necessary for different mill parts is:\r\n\r\n For each 850lb. stamp, dropping 6 inches 95 times per minute, 1·33 h.p.\r\n   ”      750      ”          ”            ”        ”          1·18  ”\r\n   ”      650      ”          ”            ”        ”          1·00  ”\r\n For an 8-inch by 10-inch Blake pattern rock-breaker           9·00  ”\r\n For a Frue or Triumph vanner, with 220 revolutions per minute,0·50  ”\r\n For a 4-feet clean-up pan, making   30         ”         ”    1·50  ”\r\n For an amalgamating barrel, making  30         ”         ”    2·50  ”\r\n For a mechanical batea, making      30         ”         ”    1·00  ”\r\n\r\nThe writer has had small practical experience of the working of that\r\nexcellent hydraulic motor, the Pelton wheel, but if by horse-power in\r\nthe table given is meant nominal horse-power, it appears to be high.\r\nWorking with 800 cwt. stamps, 80 blows a minute, 1 h.-p. nominal per\r\nstamp will be found sufficient with any good modern engine, which has no\r\nfurther burden than raising the stamps and pumping the feed water. It is\r\nalways well, however, particularly when providing engine power, to err\r\non the right side, and make provision for more than is absolutely needed\r\nfor actual battery requirements. This rule applies with equal potency to\r\npumping engines.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO AVOID LOSS IN CLEANING UP.\r\n\r\nThe following, is a hint to quartz mill managers with respect to that\r\ncommon source of loss of gold involved in the almost inevitable loss of\r\nmercury in cleaning up operations. I have known hundreds of pounds’\r\nworth of gold to be recovered from an old quartz mill site by the simple\r\nprocess of washing up the ground under the floor.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot afford to floor the whole of the battery with smooth\r\nconcrete, at all events smoothly concrete the floor of the cleaning-up\r\nroom, and let the floor slope towards the centre: where a sink is\r\nprovided. Any lost mercury must thus find its way to the centre, where\r\nit will collect and can be panned off from time to time. Of course an\r\nunderground drain and mercury trap must be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n     IRON EXTRACTOR.\r\n\r\nWhen using self-feeders, fragments of steel tools are especially liable\r\nto get into the battery boxes or other crushing appliance where they\r\nsometimes cause great mischief. I believe the following plan would be a\r\npracticable remedy for this evil.\r\n\r\nBy a belt from the cam or counter shaft, cause a powerful electric\r\nmagnet to extract all magnetic particles; then, by a simple ratchet\r\nmovement, at intervals withdraw the magnet and drop the adhering\r\nfragments into a receptacle by automatically switching off the electric\r\ncurrent. A powerful ordinary horse-shoe magnet might probably do just as\r\nwell, but would require to be re-magnetised from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO SILVER COPPER PLATES.\r\n\r\nTo silver copper plates, that is, to amalgamate them on the face with\r\nmercury, is really a most simple operation, though many battery men make\r\na great mystery of it. Indeed, when I first went into a quartz mill the\r\nprocess deemed necessary was not only a very tedious one, but very dirty\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nTo amalgamate with silver, in fact, to silver-plate your copper without\r\nresort to the electro-plating bath, take any old silver (failing that,\r\nsilver coin will do, but is more expensive), and dissolve it in somewhat\r\ndilute nitric acid, using only just sufficient acid as will effect the\r\npurpose. When the crystals have formed, add sufficient clean quick\r\nmercury to form a thick pasty amalgam; moderate heat will assist the\r\nprocess. After some hours place the ball of amalgam in a piece of strong\r\nnew calico and squeeze out any surplus mercury.\r\n\r\nAbout an ounce of silver to the foot of copper is sufficient. To apply\r\nit on new plates use somewhat dilute nitric acid applied with a swab to\r\nfree the surface of the copper from oxides or impurities, then rub the\r\nball of amalgam over the surface, using some little force. It is always\r\nwell when copper-plates are coated with silver or zinc by means of\r\nmercury to let them stand dry for a day or two before using, as the\r\nmercury oxidises and the coating metal more closely adheres.\r\n\r\nOnly the very best copper-plate procurable should be used for battery\r\ntables; bad copper will always give trouble, both in the first “curing,”\r\nand after treatment. It should not be heavily rolled copper, as the more\r\nporous the metal the more easily will the mercury penetrate and\r\namalgamate. I cannot agree that any good is attained by scouring the\r\nplates with sand and alkalies, as recommended in some books on the\r\nsubject; on the contrary, I prefer the opposite mode of treatment, and\r\neither face the plates with nitrate of silver and nitrate of mercury, or\r\nelse with sulphate of zinc and mercury, in the form of what is called\r\nzinc amalgam. If mine water, which often contains free sulphuric acid,\r\nis being used, the latter plan is preferable.\r\n\r\nThe copper should be placed smoothly on the wooden table and secured\r\nfirmly thereto by copper tacks. If the plate should be bent or buckled,\r\nit may be flattened by beating it with a heavy hammer, taking care to\r\ninterpose a piece of inch-thick soft wood between hammer and plate.\r\n\r\nTo coat with mercury only, procure some nitrate of mercury. This is\r\neasily made by placing mercury in a glazed earthenware bowl, pouring\r\nsomewhat dilute nitric acid on it, and letting it stand till the\r\nmetallic mercury is changed to a white crystal. Dense reddish-brown\r\nfumes will arise, which are injurious if breathed, so the operation\r\nshould be conducted either in the open air, or where there is a draught.\r\n\r\nNow have your silvering solution ready, which is to be somewhat diluted\r\nwith water, next take two swabs, with handles about 12 inches long, dip\r\nthe first into a basin containing dilute nitric acid, and rub it rapidly\r\nover about a foot of the surface of the plate; the oxide of copper will\r\nbe absolutely removed, and the surface of the copper rendered pure and\r\nbright; then take the other swab, wet with the dilute nitrate of\r\nmercury, and pass it over the clean surface, rubbing it well in.\r\nContinue this till the whole plate has a coating of mercury. It may be\r\nwell to go over it more than once. Then turn on the water and wash the\r\nplate clean, sprinkle with metallic mercury, rubbing it upwards until\r\nthe plate will hold no more.\r\n\r\nA basin with nitrate of mercury may be kept handy, and the plates\r\ntouched up from time to time for a few days until they get amalgamated\r\nwith gold, after which, unless you have much base metal to contend with,\r\nthey will give no further trouble.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that an excessive use of nitric acid\r\nwill result in waste of mercury, which will be carried off in a milky\r\nstream with the water; and also that it will cause the amalgam to become\r\nvery hard, and less active in attracting other particles of gold.\r\n\r\nIf you are treating the plate with nitrate of silver prepared as already\r\nmentioned, clean the plate with dilute nitric acid, rub the surface with\r\nthe ball of amalgam, following with the swab and fairly rubbing in. It\r\nwill be well to prepare the plate some days before requiring to use it,\r\nas a better adhesion of the silver and copper takes place than if\r\nmercury is applied at once.\r\n\r\nTo amalgamate with zinc amalgam, clean the copper plate by means of a\r\nswab, with fairly strong sulphuric acid diluted with water; then while\r\nwet apply the zinco-mercury amalgam and well rub in. To prepare the zinc\r\namalgam, clip some zinc (the lining of packing cases will do) into small\r\npieces and immerse them in mercury after washing them with a little weak\r\nsulphuric acid and water to remove any coating of oxide. When the\r\nmercury will absorb no more zinc, squeeze through chamois leather or\r\ncalico (as for silver amalgam), and well rub in. The plate thus prepared\r\nshould stand for a few days, dry, before using. If, before amalgamation\r\nwith gold takes place, oxide of copper or other scum should rise on this\r\nplate a little very dilute sulphuric acid will instantly remove it.\r\n\r\nSodium and cyanide of potassium are frequently used in dressing-plates,\r\nbut the former should be very sparingly employed, as it will often do\r\nmore harm than good by taking up all sorts of base metals with the\r\namalgam, and so presenting a surface which the gold will pass over\r\nwithout adhering to. Where water is scarce, and is consequently used\r\nover and over again, lime may be added to the pulp, or, if lime is not\r\nprocurable, wood ashes may be used. The effect is two-fold; the lime not\r\nonly tends to “sweeten” sulphide ores and keep the tables clean, but\r\nalso causes the water to cleanse itself more quickly of the slimes,\r\nwhich will be more rapidly precipitated. When zinc amalgam is used,\r\nalkalies would, of course, be detrimental.\r\n\r\nWhen no other water than that from the mine is available, difficulties\r\noften arise owing to the impurities it contains. These are various, but\r\namong the most common are the soluble sulphates, and sometimes free\r\nsulphuric acid evolved by the oxidisation of metallic sulphides. In the\r\npresence of this difficulty, do one of two things: either _utilise_ or\r\n_neutralise_. In certain cases, I recommend the former. Some time since\r\nI was treating, for gold extraction, material from a mine which was very\r\ncomplex in character. For this ore I coined the term “polysynthetic.”\r\nThis contained about half a dozen different sulphides. The upper parts\r\nof the lode being partially oxidised, free sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄)\r\nwas evolved. I therefore, following out a former discovery, added a\r\nlittle metallic zinc to the mercury in the boxes and on the plates with\r\nexcellent results. When the free acid in the ore began to give out in\r\nthe lower levels I added minute quantities of sulphuric acid to the\r\nwater from time to time. I have since found, however, that with some\r\nwater, particularly West Australian, the reaction is so feeble (probably\r\nowing to the lime and magnesia present) as to make this mode of\r\ntreatment unsuitable.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 35. DOLLY.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 35A. PRIMITIVE DOLLY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOW TO MAKE A DOLLY.\r\n\r\nI have seen some rather elaborate dollies, intended to be worked with\r\namalgamating tables, but the usual prototype of the quartz mill is set\r\nup, more or less, as follows: A tree stump, from 9 in. to a foot\r\ndiameter, is levelled off smoothly at about 2 ft. from the ground; on\r\nthis is firmly fixed a circular plate of ½ in. iron, say 9 in. in\r\ndiameter; a band of ³/₁₆ in. iron, about 8 or 9 in. in height, fits\r\nmore or less closely round the plate (Fig. 35). This is the battery box.\r\nA beam of heavy wood, about 3 in. diameter and 6 ft. long, shod with\r\niron, is vertically suspended, about 9 in. above the stump, from a\r\nflexible sapling with just sufficient spring in above the stump, from\r\na flexible sapling with just sufficient spring in it to raise the pestle\r\nto the required height. About 2 ft. from the bottom the hanging beam is\r\npierced with an auger hole and a rounded piece of wood, 1½ in. by 18\r\nin., is driven through to serve as a handle for the man who is to do the\r\npounding. His mate breaks the stone to about 2 in. gauge and feeds the\r\nbox, lifting the ring from time to time to sweep off the triturated\r\ngangue, which he screens through a sieve into a pan and washes off,\r\neither by means of a cradle or simply by panning. In dollying it\r\ngenerally pays to burn the stone, as so much labour in crushing is thus\r\nsaved. A couple of small kilns to hold about a ton each dug out of a\r\nclay bank will be found to save fuel where firewood is scarce, and will\r\nmore thoroughly burn the stone and dissipate the base metals, but it\r\nmust be remembered that gold from burnt stone is liable to become so\r\nencrusted with the base metal oxides as to be difficult to amalgamate.\r\nFig. 35A represents another primitive dolly (Plate VI. hand dollying).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE VI.--HAND DOLLYING _To face p._ 152]\r\n\r\n\r\n     ROUGH WINDLASS.\r\n\r\nMake two St. Andrew’s crosses with four saplings, the upper angle being\r\nshorter than the lower; fix these upright, one at each end of the shaft;\r\nstay them together by cross pieces till you have constructed something\r\nlike a “horse,” such as is used for sawing wood, the crutch being a\r\nlittle over 3 feet high. Select a log for a windlass barrel, about 6 in.\r\ndiameter and a foot longer than the distance between the supports, as\r\nstraight as is procurable; cut in it two circular slots about an inch\r\ndeep by 2 in. wide to fit into the forks; at one end cut a straight slot\r\n2 in. deep across the face. Now get a crooked bough, as nearly the shape\r\nof a handle as nature has produced it, and trim it into right angular\r\nshape, fit one end into the barrel, and you have a windlass that will\r\npull up many a ton of stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n     PUDDLER.\r\n\r\nThis is made by excavating a circular hole about 2 ft. 9 in. deep and,\r\nsay, 12 ft. in diameter. An outer and inner wall are then constructed of\r\nslabs 2 ft. 6 in. in height to ground level, the outer wall being thus\r\n30 ft. and the inner 15 ft. in circumference. The circular space\r\nbetween is floored with smooth hard-wood slabs or boards, and the whole\r\nmade secure and water-tight. In the middle of the inner enclosure a\r\nstout post is planted, to stand a few inches above the wall, and the\r\nsurrounding space is filled up with clay rammed tight. A strong iron pin\r\nis inserted in the centre of the post, on which is fitted a revolving\r\nbeam, which hangs across the whole circumference of the machine and\r\nprotrudes a couple of feet or so on each side. To this beam are\r\nattached, with short chains, a couple of drags made like V-shaped\r\nharrows by driving pieces of rod iron through a heavy frame, shaped as a\r\nrectangular triangle (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 36. PUDDLING MACHINE (SECTIONAL VIEW).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 37. PUDDLING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nTo one end of the beam an old horse is attached, who, as he slowly walks\r\nround the circular track, causes the harrows and drags to so puddle the\r\nwashdirt and water in the great wooden enclosure that the clay is\r\ngradually disintegrated, and flows off with the water which is from\r\ntime to time admitted. The clean gravel is then run through a “cradle,”\r\n“long Tom,” or “sluice,” and the gold saved. This, of course, is the\r\nsimplest form of gold mining. In the great alluvial mines other and more\r\nintricate appliances are used, but the principle of extraction is the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A MAKESHIFT PUMP.\r\n\r\nTo make a temporary small “draw-lift” pump, which will work down to a\r\nhundred feet or more if required, take a large size common suction\r\nDouglas pump, and, after removing the top and the handle, fix the pump\r\nas close to the highest level of the water in the shaft as can be\r\narranged. Now make a square water-tight wooden column of slightly\r\ngreater capacity than the suction pipe, fix this to the top of the pump,\r\nand by means of wooden rods, work the whole from the surface, using\r\neither a longer levered handle or, with a little ingenuity, horse-power.\r\nIf you can get it the iron downpipe used to carry the water from the\r\nguttering of houses is more easily adapted for the pipe column; then,\r\nalso, iron pump rods can be used, but I have raised water between 60 and\r\n70 feet with a large size Douglas pump provided only with a wooden\r\ncolumn and rods.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SQUEEZING AMALGAM.\r\n\r\nFor squeezing amalgam, strong calico, not too coarse, previously soaked\r\nin clean water, is quite as good as ordinary chamois leather. Some gold\r\nis fine enough to escape through either.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MERCURY EXTRACTOR.\r\n\r\nThe mercury extractor or amalgam separator (Fig. 38) is a machine which\r\nis very simple in construction, and is stated to most efficient in\r\nextracting quicksilver from amalgam, as it requires but from two to\r\nthree minutes to extract the bulk of the mercury from one hundred pounds\r\nof amalgam, leaving the amalgam drier than when strained in the ordinary\r\nway by squeezing through chamois leather or calico. The principle is\r\nthat of the De Laval cream separator--_i.e._, rapid centrifugal motion.\r\nThe appliance is easily put together, and as easily taken apart. The\r\ncylinder is made of steel, and is run at a very high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nThe general construction of the appliance is as follows: The casing or\r\nreceiver is a steel cylinder, which has a pivot at the bottom to receive\r\nthe step for an upright hollow shaft, to which a second cylinder of\r\nsmaller diameter is attached. The second cylinder is perforated, and a\r\nfine wire cloth is inserted. The mercury, after passing through the\r\ncloth, is discharged through the perforations. When the machine is\r\nrevolved at great speed, the mercury is forced into the outside\r\ncylinder, leaving the amalgam, which has been first placed in a calico\r\nor canvas bag, in a much drier state than it could be strained by hand.\r\nWhile not prepared to endorse absolutely all that is claimed for this\r\nappliance, I consider that it has mechanical probability on its side,\r\nand that where large quantities of amalgam have to be treated it will be\r\nfound useful and effective.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 38. MERCURY EXTRACTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     SLUICE PLATES.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. F. W. Drake for the following account of sluice\r\nplates, which I have never tried, but think the device worth attention:\r\n\r\n“An addition has been made to the gold-saving appliances by the placing\r\nof what are called in America, ‘sluice plates’ below the ordinary\r\ntable. The pulp now flows over an amalgamating surface, 14 ft. long by\r\n4 ft. wide, sloping 1½ in. to the foot, and is then contracted into a\r\ncopper-plated sluice 15 ft. long by 14 in. wide, having a fall of 1\r\nin. to the foot. Our mill manager (Mr. G. C. Knapp), advocated these\r\nsluice plates for a long time before I would consent to a trial. I\r\ncontended that as we got little or no amalgam from the lower end of our\r\ntable plates, there was no gold going away capable of being recovered\r\nby copper plates; and even if it were, narrow sluice plates were a\r\nstep in the wrong direction. If anything, the amalgamating surface\r\nshould be widened to give the particles of gold a better chance to\r\nsettle. His argument was that the conditions should be changed; by\r\nnarrowing the stream and giving it less fall, gold, which was incapable\r\nof amalgamation on the wide plates, would be saved. We finally put\r\none in, and it proved so successful that we now have one at the end\r\nof each table. The percentage recovered on the sluice plates, of the\r\ntotal yield, varies, and has been as follows:--October, 9·1 per cent.;\r\nNovember, 6·9 per cent.; December, 6·4 per cent.; January, 4·3 per\r\ncent.; February, 9·3 per cent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     MEASURING INACCESSIBLE DISTANCES.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the width of a difficult gorge, a deep river, or\r\ntreacherous swamp without crossing and measuring, sight a conspicuous\r\nobject at the edge of the bank on the farther side; then as nearly\r\nopposite and square as possible plant a stake about five feet high, walk\r\nalong the nearer margin to what you guess to be half the distance across\r\n(exactitude in this respect is not material to the result), there plant\r\nanother stake, and continuing in a straight line put in a third. The\r\nstakes must be equal distances apart and as nearly as possible at a\r\nright angle to the first line. Now, carrying in hand a fourth stake,\r\nstrike a line inland at right angles to the base and as soon as sighting\r\nover the fourth stake, you can get the fourth and second stakes and the\r\nobject on the opposite shore in line your problem is complete. The\r\ndistance between No. 4 and No. 3 stakes is the same as that between No.\r\n1 and the opposite bank (Fig. 39).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 39. MEASURING INACCESSIBLE DISTANCES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO SET OUT A RIGHT ANGLE WITH A TAPE.\r\n\r\nMeasure 40 ft. on the line to which you wish to run at right angles, and\r\nput pegs at A and B (Fig. 40); then, with the end of the tape held\r\ncarefully at A, take 80 ft., and have the 80 ft. mark held at B. Take\r\nthe 50 ft. mark and pull from A and B until the tape lies straight and\r\neven, you will then have the point C perpendicular to AB. Continue\r\nstraight lines by sighting over two sticks in the well-known way.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 41.]\r\n\r\n_Another Method._--Stick a pin in each corner of a square board (Fig.\r\n41), and look diagonally across them, first in the direction of the\r\nline to which you wish to run at right angles, and then for the new line\r\nsight across the other two pins.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A SIMPLE LEVELLING INSTRUMENT.\r\n\r\nFasten a common carpenter’s square in a slit to the top of a stake by\r\nmeans of a screw, and then tie a plumb-line at the angle so that it may\r\nhang along the short arm, when the plumb-line hangs vertically and\r\nsights may be taken over it. A carpenter’s spirit-level set on an\r\nadjustable stand will do as well. The other arm will then be a level\r\n(Fig. 42).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 42. FIG. 43. LEVELLING INSTRUMENTS.]\r\n\r\nAnother very simple, but effective, device for finding a level line is\r\nby means of a triangle of wood made of half-inch boards from 9 to 12 ft.\r\nlong (Fig. 43). To make the legs level, set the triangle up on fairly\r\nlevel ground, suspend a plummet from the top and mark on the cross-piece\r\nwhere the line touches it. Then reverse the triangle, end for end,\r\nexactly, and mark the new line the plumb-line makes. Now make a new mark\r\nexactly half way between the two, and when the plumb-line coincides with\r\nthis, the two legs are standing on level ground. For short water races\r\nthis is a very handy method of laying out a level line.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF A STANDING TREE.\r\n\r\nTake a stake about your own height, and walking from the butt of the\r\ntree to what you judge to be the height of the timber portion you want,\r\ndrive your stake into the ground till the top is level with your eyes;\r\nnow lie straight out on your back, placing your feet against the stake,\r\nand sight a point on the tree (see Fig. 44). AB equals BC. If BC is,\r\nsay, 40 ft., that will be the height of your “stick of timber.” Thus,\r\nmuch labour may be saved in felling trees the timber portion of which\r\nmay afterwards be found to be too short for your purpose.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 44. Measuring Height of a Standing Tree.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     LEVELLING BY ANEROID BAROMETER (Fig. 45).\r\n\r\nThis should be used more for ascertaining relatively large differences\r\nin altitudes than for purposes where any great nicety is required. For\r\nhills under 2000 ft., the following rule will give a very close\r\napproximation, and is easily remembered, because 55°, the assumed\r\ntemperature, agrees with 55°, the significant figures in the 55,000\r\nfactor, while the fractional correction contains _two fours_.\r\n\r\nObserve the altitudes and also the temperatures on the Fahrenheit\r\nthermometer at top and bottom respectively, of the hill, and take the\r\nmean between them. Let _B_ represent the mean altitude and _b_ the mean\r\ntemperature. Then 55000 × (B-b / B + b) = height of the hill in feet\r\nfor the temperature of 55°. Add 1/440 of this result for every degree\r\nthe mean temperature exceeds 55°; or subtract as much for every degree\r\nbelow 55°.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 45. ANEROID BAROMETER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO DETERMINE HEIGHTS OF OBJECTS.\r\n\r\n    _By Shadows._\r\n\r\n1. Set up vertically a stick of known length, and measure the length of\r\nits shadow upon a horizontal or other plane; measure also the length of\r\nthe shadow thrown by the object whose height is required. Then it will\r\nbe:--As the length of the stick’s shadow is to the length of the stick\r\nitself, so is the length of the shadow of the object to the object’s\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _By Reflection._\r\n\r\nPlace a vessel of water upon the ground and recede from it until you see\r\nthe top of the object reflected from the surface of the water. Then it\r\nwill be:--As your horizontal distance from the point of reflection is to\r\nthe height of your eye above the reflecting surface, so is the\r\nhorizontal distance of the foot of the object from the vessel to its\r\naltitude above the said surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Instrumentally._\r\n\r\nRead the vertical angle, and multiply its natural tangent by the\r\ndistance between instrument and foot of object; the result is the\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nWhen much accuracy is not required vertical angles can be measured by\r\nmeans of a quadrant of simple construction, represented in Fig. 46. The\r\narc AB is a quadrant, graduated in degrees from B to A; C, the point\r\nfrom which the plummet P is suspended, being the centre of the quadrant.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\n_When_ the sights AC are directed towards any object, S, the degrees in\r\nthe arc, BP, are the measure of the angle of elevation, SAD, of the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO FIND THE DEPTH OF A SHAFT.\r\n\r\n_Rule_:--Square the number of seconds a stone takes to reach the bottom\r\nand multiply by 16.\r\n\r\nThus, if a stone takes 5 seconds to fall to the bottom of a shaft--\r\n\r\n    5² = 25; and 25 × 16 = 400 feet, the required depth of shaft.\r\n\r\n\r\n     DESCRIPTION OF PLAN FOR RE-USING WATER.\r\n\r\nWhere water is scarce it may be necessary to use it repeatedly. In a\r\ncase of this kind in Egypt, the Arab miners have adopted an ingenious\r\nmethod, which is shown in Fig. 47, and may be adapted to almost any set\r\nof conditions. At _a_ is a sump or water-pit; _b_ is an inclined plane\r\non which the mineral is washed and whence the water escapes into a tank\r\n_c_; _d_ is a conduit for taking the water back to _a_; _e_ is a conduit\r\nor lever pump for raising the water. A certain amount of filtration\r\ncould easily be managed during the passage from _c_ to _a_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    COOLING COMPOUND FOR HEATED BEARINGS.\r\n\r\nMercurial ointment mixed with black cylinder oil and applied every\r\nquarter of an hour, or as often as expedient. The following is also\r\nrecommended as a good cooling compound for heavy bearings:--Tallow 2\r\nlb., plumbago 6 oz., sugar of lead 4 oz. Melt the tallow with gentle\r\nheat and add the other ingredients, stirring until cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLEANING GREASY PLUMMER BLOCKS.\r\n\r\nWhen, through carelessness or unpreventable causes, plummer blocks and\r\nother detachable portions of machinery become clogged with sticky\r\ndeposits of grease and impurities, a simple mode of cleansing the same\r\nis to take about 1000 parts by weight of boiling water, to which add\r\nabout 10 or 15 parts of ordinary washing soda. Keep the water on the\r\nboil and place therein the portions of the machine that are to be\r\ncleaned; this treatment has the effect of quickly loosening all grease,\r\noil, and dirt, after which the metal is thoroughly washed and dried. The\r\naction of the lye is to form with the grease a soap soluble in water. To\r\nprevent lubricating oil hardening upon the parts of the machinery when\r\nin use, add a third part of kerosene.\r\n\r\n\r\n     PREVENTING SCALING AND PRIMING IN BOILERS.\r\n\r\nGraphite “black-lead” added to the water in a boiler prevents scaling\r\nand priming. My method is to paint the inside of the boiler with a good\r\ncoat of graphite mixed with water to the consistency of thin gruel, and\r\nlet it stand till dry. It will not be amiss to give a second coat before\r\ngetting up steam. Even if slight scaling has already taken place, the\r\ngraphite particles will penetrate and the scale come away gradually.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CLEARING SCALE-STOPPED PIPES.\r\n\r\nWhere the water contains a large amount of mineral in solution, the\r\npipes, particularly the small ones, inch to two inch, quickly become\r\nuseless because of the rapid deposition of scale. I have seen in West\r\nAustralia tons of small pipes thrown on to the scrap heap after a few\r\nmonths use, because of this difficulty. The treatment now indicated,\r\nwhich is my own invention, will make such pipes as good as new at small\r\nexpense. Have a brick trough a little longer than your pipe. In this put\r\na fire of wood, charcoal, coke, or a mixture of such fuel. Lay the\r\npipes, a few at a time, in this. Heat slowly to cherry red. Then with\r\npinchers suddenly immerse in a second trough of cold water, supporting\r\none end above the water level. Most of the scale or incrustation will\r\nbe violently ejected. With a long pipe, if the heat has not been\r\nregular, some may still adhere. Then usually tapping with a hammer will\r\ndetach it. If not, a second heating and immersion will do so, leaving\r\nthe interior as clean as when made. It is hardly necessary to add that\r\n’tis best to stand clear of the ends when the explosion takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n     AN EXCELLENT ANTI-FRICTION COMPOUND.\r\n\r\nFor use on cams and stamper shanks, which will be harmless should it\r\ndrop into the mortar or stamper boxes, is graphite (black-lead) and soft\r\nsoap. When the guides are wooden, the soft soap need not be added;\r\ngraphite “black-lead” made into a paste with water will act admirably.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO CLEAN BRASS.\r\n\r\nOxalic acid 1 oz., rotten stone 6 oz., powdered gum arabic ½ oz.,\r\nsweet oil 1 oz. Rub on with a piece of rag.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A SOLVENT FOR RUST.\r\n\r\nIt is often very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to remove rust\r\nfrom articles made of iron. Those which are very thickly coated are most\r\neasily cleaned by being immersed in a nearly saturated solution of\r\nchloride of tin. The length of time they remain in this bath is\r\ndetermined by the thickness of the coating of rust. Generally from\r\ntwelve to twenty-four hours is long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO PROTECT IRON AND STEEL FROM RUST.\r\n\r\nThe following method is but little known, although it deserves\r\npreference over many others. Add 7 oz. of quicklime to 1¾ pints of\r\ncold water. Let the mixture stand until the supernatant fluid is\r\nentirely clear. Then pour this off, and mix with it enough olive oil to\r\nform a thick cream, or rather to the consistency of melted and\r\nrecongealed butter. Grease the articles of iron or steel with this\r\ncompound, and then wrap them up in paper, or if this cannot be done,\r\napply the mixture somewhat more thickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO KEEP MACHINERY FROM RUSTING.\r\n\r\nTake 1 oz. of camphor, dissolve it in 1 lb. of melted lard; mix with it\r\n(after removing the scum) as much fine graphite as will give it an iron\r\ncolour; clean the machinery, and smear it with this mixture. After\r\ntwenty-four hours rub off and clean with soft, linen cloth. This mixture\r\nwill keep machinery clean for months under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n     FIRE-LUTE.\r\n\r\nAn excellent fire-lute is made of eight parts sharp sand, two parts good\r\nclay, and one part horse-dung; mix and temper like mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ROPE-SPLICING.\r\n\r\nA short splice is made by unlaying the ends of two pieces of rope to a\r\nsufficient length, then interlaying them as in Fig. 48 (upper cut), draw\r\nthem close and push the strands of one under the strands of the other\r\nseveral times as shown in the lower cut.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\nThis splice makes a thick lump on the rope and is only used for slings,\r\nblock-straps, cables, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    APPENDIX\r\n\r\n    (_SELECTED DATA FOR MINING MEN_)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO FIND LOST PART OF VEIN\r\n\r\nZimmermann’s rule for finding the lost part of a vein on the other side\r\nof a vein, is as follows:--\r\n\r\nLay down upon paper the line of strike of lode and the line of strike of\r\nthe fault (cross-course), and by construction ascertain the horizontal\r\nprojection of the line of their intersection; from the point where the\r\ncross-course was struck by the lode, draw a line at right angles to the\r\nstrike of the former and directed to its opposite wall. Notice on which\r\nside of the line of intersection this perpendicular falls, and after\r\ncutting through the cross-course, seek the “heaved” part of the lode on\r\nthat side.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\nThus let AB (Fig. 49) represent, at any depth, the line of strike of a\r\nfault or cross-course dipping east, and CD the line of strike of a lode\r\ndipping south, and we will suppose that in driving from C to D in a\r\nwesterly direction, the fault has been met with at D. Knowing the dip of\r\nthe lode and that of the fault, it is easy to lay down on any given\r\nscale, A′B′ and C′D′, the lines of strike of the fault and lode\r\nrespectively at a certain depth, say 10 fathoms, below AB. The point D″,\r\nwhere A′B′ and C′D′ meet, is one point of the line of intersection. Join\r\nD and D″, and prolong on both sides. The line MN represents the\r\nhorizontal projection of the line of intersection of the two planes. At\r\nD erect DE at right angles and directed towards the opposite wall of the\r\nfault. As DE falls south of MN, the miner, after cutting through the\r\nfault, would drive in a southerly direction and eventually strike the\r\nlode again at F. It will be at once understood that if the miner were\r\nfollowing the lode from _b_ to F, the perpendicular would lie to the\r\nnorth of the line of intersection, and following the rule, he would\r\ndrive in that direction, after cutting through the fault. When several\r\nfaults in succession dislocate a lode, very great complications may\r\narise.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE CALCULATION OF ORE RESERVES.[4]\r\n\r\nHaving finished the survey of a metalliferous mine, the surveyor is\r\nsometimes called upon to calculate the quantity of ore reserves in that\r\nmine. Various methods are employed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n    [4] Bennett H. Brough’s “Treatise on Mine Surveying,” sixth\r\n    edition, p. 165.\r\n\r\nIndeed, different surveyors will not agree within wide limits as to the\r\namount of ore reserves in the same mine. Sometimes the amount of ore in\r\nsight will be considered to be a rectangular block, limited by the\r\noutcrop of the vein, the depth of the shaft, and the extreme points of\r\nthe levels, diminished by the amount extracted. Other surveyors would\r\navoid so excessive an amount, and take but one-third of that amount.\r\n\r\nThe following method is recommended by Mr. J. G. Murphy, an experienced\r\nAmerican mining engineer, as the fairest and most trustworthy:--\r\n\r\nLet it be required to calculate the ore reserves in a mine opened up on\r\na vein with a mean cross section of 6 feet; a cubic foot of the vein\r\nmatter in place weighing 150 lb. The ore stopes are generally very\r\nirregular. In this case, however, it may be supposed that the stope\r\nfaces are 11 feet apart and 8 feet high. There is an inclined shaft, 10\r\nfeet by 6 feet, following the dip of the vein, and six levels, each 7\r\nfeet by 6 feet, 100 feet apart. The lengths of the levels are--\r\n\r\n       I. 200 feet west 150 feet east.\r\n      II. 160      ”    100      ”\r\n     III. 120      ”    400      ”\r\n      IV. 100 feet west 140 feet east.\r\n       V. 165      ”    180      ”\r\n      VI. 350      ”    150      ”\r\n\r\nThe longest level west is 350 feet, and the shortest 100 feet.\r\n\r\nAssuming the bounding line of the area of available ore to be at a\r\ndistance west of the shaft--\r\n\r\n   100 + (350-100) = 225 feet\r\n         ---------\r\n             2\r\n\r\nIf the longest level east is 400 feet, and the shortest 100 feet, the\r\nbounding line in this direction, calculated in a similar way, will be at\r\na distance of 250 feet from the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe inclined shaft has opened up the vein for 670 feet. Deducting, say,\r\n15 feet for the irregularity of the surface, the quantity of ore in\r\nsight will be a rectangular block 655 feet deep, 225 + 250, or 475 feet\r\nlong and 6 feet wide, that is 1,866,750 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nFrom this quantity, however, must be deducted the quantity of ore\r\nextracted, namely:--\r\n\r\n                                                           Cubic Feet.\r\n\r\n       Inclined shaft   665 × 10 × 6 =                         39,900\r\n       Level    I.      350 ×  7 × 6 =                         14,700\r\n         ”     II.      260 ×  7 × 6 =                         10,920\r\n         ”    III.      520 ×  7 × 6 =                         21,840\r\n         ”     IV.      240 ×  7 × 6 =                         10,080\r\n         ”      V.      345 ×  7 × 6 =                         14,490\r\n         ”     VI.      500 ×  7 × 6 =                         21,000\r\n         ”      I.    Stoped east (rough estimate)              3,400\r\n         ”      I.      ”    west                               6,500\r\n         ”     II.      ”    west                               7,000\r\n         ”    III.      ”    east                              20,000\r\n         ”     VI.      ”    west                              12,000\r\n                                                              --------\r\n                               Total                          181,530\r\n                               Or in round numbers            182,000\r\n\r\nThis quantity, deducted from 1,866,750 cubic feet, leave 1,684,750 cubic\r\nfeet. Divided by 13½, the number of cubic feet required for a ton, this\r\ngives 124,797 tons of ore in sight.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of ore discovered in a mine may be estimated from its\r\nspecific gravity and the average size of the vein. The specific gravity\r\nof the ore, with that of water taken at 1000 for standard is equal to\r\nthe number of ounces in a cubic foot. Great caution is necessary to\r\ndetermine the proportion of the vein which may be considered solid ore.\r\nA vein 6 feet square and 1 inch thick, contains 3 cubic feet, therefore,\r\nin order to find the number of cubic feet per square fathom of a vein,\r\nit is merely necessary to multiply the thickness in inches by three.\r\n\r\nThe following example illustrates the method of finding the weight of\r\nany ore per square fathom in a vein. What quantity of galena will be\r\nproduced per square fathom from a mineral vein 6 inches in width? One\r\nquarter of the vein consists of galena, the remainder of zinc-blende.\r\nOne-twentieth must be allowed for cavities in the vein. The specific\r\ngravity of galena is 7·5, and a cubic foot of water weighs 1000 ounces;\r\ntherefore a cubic foot of galena weighs 7500 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe vein being 6 inches thick, there are 18 cubic feet in a square\r\nfathom. One quarter of that amount, or 4·5 cubic feet, consists of\r\ngalena. The weight of galena in ounces is therefore:\r\n\r\n    7500 × 4·5 = 33,750 =                    2109·375 lb.\r\n    From this one-twentieth or                105·468 lb.\r\n                                           --------------\r\n    must be deducted, leaving                2003·907 lb.\r\n\r\n    or 17 cwt. 3 qr. 15 lb. as the weight of lead ore per square\r\n    fathom.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ESTIMATING ORE VALUES.\r\n\r\nIn testing a gold mine with a view to purchase, it should be remembered\r\nthat as a rule the intersections of leaders or small veins with the\r\nmain ore body are usually the richest portions of the lode. This the\r\nexperienced prospector knows, and generally his shafts and cuttings are\r\nmade at such points. For the ordinary mining investor, when inspecting\r\nwith a view to purchase, these are places to avoid if endeavouring to\r\nform a correct estimate of the value of the ore in bulk. Take samples\r\nacross the lode from place to place, break down and bag personally, and\r\nmark bags. Test the rich portions separately and average, estimating\r\nquantity of both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.--CALIFORNIA PUMP. _To face p._ 171.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    CALIFORNIA PUMP.\r\n\r\nAny handy man or rough bush carpenter can make a California Pump. The\r\nprospectors in the illustration (Plate VII.) are using a home-made\r\ncontrivance, which is quite effective for raising water from shallow\r\ndepths for “long tom,” or ground sluicing--a wooden frame-work and open\r\nwooden wheel with handle. Over the wheel is run a belt of canvas, say,\r\nsix inches wide, with wood stops about a foot apart--a long sloping box,\r\ndipping into the water, up which the stopped belt travels--and you have\r\na California Pump which, if not a highly scientific device, is at least\r\nvery serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HYDRAULICS.\r\n\r\n    _General Data Regarding Water._\r\n\r\nAn imperial gallon of water weighs, at 62° F., 10 lbs. avoirdupois.

This is attached to a hollow steel tube which\r\nis kept rotating at about 250 revolutions per minute, pressed forward by\r\na force varying from 400 to 800 lb. according to the nature of the rock.\r\nWater is supplied through the tube which washes out the _débris_ and\r\ncools the diamonds.\r\n\r\nGranite and the hardest limestones are penetrated at the rate of 2 to 3\r\ninches per minute, sandstones 4 inches, quartz 1 inch.\r\n\r\nThe diamond drill is not effective in soft strata such as clay, sand,\r\nand alluvial deposits.\r\n\r\nBoreholes have been made at the following rates:\r\n\r\n  _In Ironstone formation_:\r\n\r\n      A depth of 902 feet in 54 working days.\r\n                 641      ”  48      ”\r\n                 434      ”  54      ”\r\n                 640      ”  60      ”\r\n      Or an average of 12 feet a day.\r\n\r\n  _In Coal measures_:\r\n\r\n      A depth of 1008 feet in 146 days\r\n                  802     ”   168   ”\r\n                  700     ”    48   ”\r\n                  558     ”    42   ”\r\n      Or an average of 7½ feet a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TIMBER.\r\n\r\n    =To find Solidity of Round Timber.=\r\n\r\n_When all dimensions are in feet_: Length × (¼ mean girth)² = cubic\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n_When length in feet_, _girth in inches_: Length × (¼ mean girth) ÷\r\n144 = cubic feet.\r\n\r\n_When all dimensions are in inches_: Length × (¼ mean girth)² ÷ 1728\r\n= cubic feet.\r\n\r\n    =To find Solidity of Square Timber.=\r\n\r\n_When all dimensions are in feet_: Length × breadth × depth = cubic\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n_When one dimension is in inches_: Length × breadth × depth ÷ 12 = cubic\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n_When two dimensions are in inches_: Length × breadth × depth ÷ 144 =\r\ncubic feet.\r\n\r\n    For board measure, depth always equal 1 inch.\r\n\r\nTo find surface in square feet, proceed as per rules for solidity of\r\nsquare timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LAYING OUT OF AREAS.\r\n\r\n1. _In Squares._--Extract the square root of the desired content,\r\nreduced to square chains (ten square chains equal one acre). The result\r\nwill be the length of the required side in chains.\r\n\r\nThus if we wish to find the side of a square block containing 25 acres,\r\nwe first reduce the acres to square chains: 25 × 10 = 250, the square\r\nroot of which is 15·81, or 15 chains 81 links; the side required.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the tables of square roots on page 189, the required\r\nsides of square block for a large number of acres can be read off at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n_One acre_ laid out as a square must have its side made 316¼ links,\r\nor 208-71/100 feet, or 69-57/100 yards, 70 paces being a near\r\napproximation.\r\n\r\n2. _In Rectangles._--Divide the content by the length or breadth,\r\naccording to which factor is known, and the result will be the required\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThus 5 acres, or 50 square chains, if 10 chains long, will require to be\r\n5 chains wide.\r\n\r\nIf the content only is given, and the length is to be a certain number\r\nof times the breadth, the content in square chains divided by the ratio\r\nof the length to the breadth, and the square root of the quotient, will\r\ngive the length of the shorter side. Thus, if we wish to lay out 72\r\nacres as a rectangle twice as long as broad: 72 acres = 720 square\r\nchains, divided by 2, the ratio given, = 360, the square root of which\r\nis 18·97 chains, the length of the shorter side. The length of the other\r\nside is therefore 18·97 × 2 = 37·94 chains, or 3794 links.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MENSURATION.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF A TRIANGLE WHEN THE BASE AND PERPENDICULAR HEIGHT\r\nARE GIVEN=: Multiply the base by half the height, or _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF A TRIANGLE WHEN THE THREE SIDES ARE GIVEN=: Take half\r\nthe sum of the sides, subtract each severally from this sum, then\r\nmultiply this and the three remainders together, and take the square\r\nroot for the area.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF A RECTANGULAR FIGURE=: Multiply the length by the\r\nbreadth, the product will be the area.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF A TRAPEZOID=: Multiply half the sum of the two\r\nparallel sides by the distance between them.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF A PARALLELOGRAM WHOSE ANGLES ARE NOT RIGHT ANGLES=:\r\nMultiply the length of any one of the sides by the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF A TRAPEZIUM=: Divide it into two triangles and find\r\nthe areas of the latter by the first rule.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF AN IRREGULAR POLYGON=: Divide the polygon into\r\ntriangles and find the area of the latter.\r\n\r\n=TO FIND THE AREA OF AN IRREGULAR FIGURE=: Draw the figure on fine\r\ncardboard or thin sheet metal, cut the same carefully out and weigh with\r\nan accurate balance. Then this weight, compared with the weight of a\r\npiece of the cardboard or metal of a definite size, say one square inch,\r\ngives at once the area required.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MINE SURVEYING PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\nIt would be futile to profess, in the limits of a small work of this\r\nkind, to instruct the beginner fully in the principles and practice of\r\nmine surveying, especially as the most elaborate treatise can only be of\r\nservice when some actual practical experience and knowledge of\r\ninstruments have been obtained.\r\n\r\nFor an exhaustive and well-arranged work on the subject, Brough’s\r\n“Treatise on Mine Surveying” can be strongly recommended, and should be\r\ncarefully studied by all wishing to learn the best methods of\r\naccomplishing the accurate results that any mine-surveying worth the\r\nname demands.\r\n\r\nThe following methods of connecting underground and surface work are\r\ntherefore addressed to such as are thoroughly acquainted with a dial and\r\nthe method of traversing.\r\n\r\n1. =TO FIND WHERE A SHAFT SHOULD BE SUNK TO CONNECT WITH ANY PART OF THE\r\nUNDERGROUND WORKINGS.=\r\n\r\nShould the mine be one opened by an adit, there is no difficulty in\r\ndoing this, as the dial can be set up at the mouth and a sight taken to\r\na light; this can then, by means of the vertical arc, be prolonged up\r\nthe hill, and the remaining bearings and distances are then easily laid\r\ndown to the desired point. When a starting-point has been obtained, the\r\nchief difficulty in these cases has been overcome. If a single shaft is\r\nthe only connection to the underground workings, the magnetic bearing of\r\nthe first line at bottom must first be carefully ascertained, and the\r\nposition of the first station brought to the surface by means of a\r\nplumb-line, made of copper wire preferably, the plummet being put into a\r\ndish of water to steady it. The dial is then set exactly over the end of\r\nthe line at the surface, and the first bearing and distance laid off.\r\n\r\nShould it be impossible to set the instrument over the point at surface,\r\na spot must be found by trial outside the shaft which is in the correct\r\ncourse. The dial is set up in the supposed direction of the line and\r\nrepeated sights taken to the first point till the instrument and it are\r\nexactly in the required line, when the length of the first line can be\r\nmeasured along it, and the new lines proceeded with.\r\n\r\nAs local attraction frequently affects the needle at the bottom of the\r\nshaft, and so vitiates the surface survey that depends on its swinging\r\nthe same at both points, a method of dispensing with the needle must be\r\nresorted to. This is the suspension of two plumb-lines from opposite\r\nsides of the shaft, the plummets hanging exactly over as much of the\r\nfirst underground line as the width of the shaft will allow.\r\n\r\nThe two plummet lines at surface then give the direction, and by trial\r\nthe dial must be put exactly in line with them in order to prolong it\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nIf there are two or more shafts sunk on the workings, it will be an easy\r\nmatter to ascertain if the needle can be depended on for laying out any\r\nfurther surface work, as the underground survey connecting the shafts\r\ncan be laid down on the surface, or the direct bearing and distance\r\ncalculated, when its correctness is tested by the terminating point of\r\nthe survey.\r\n\r\n2. =TO FIND DEPTH OF SHAFT AT ANY POINT, TO CUT A VEIN WHOSE DIP IS KNOWN.=\r\n\r\nRULE:--Multiply natural tangent of angle of dip C (Fig. 50.) by the\r\ndistance from outcrop to proposed shaft AC. The result is the depth\r\nrequired, AB.\r\n\r\n=_By Protractor and Scale._=--Rule on paper a line AC of the required\r\ndistance, then at C set off the angle of dip and draw AB at right\r\nangles to AC. Then scale off AB = depth of shafts.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 50.]\r\n\r\n3. =GIVEN DEPTH OF SHAFT AND ANGLE OF DIP TO FIND WHERE IT OUTCROPS.=\r\n--Then AC = AB × natural tangent of angle ABC. Or by scale and\r\nprotractor by inspection.\r\n\r\n4. =GIVEN DEPTH OF SHAFT AB AND DIP OF VEIN ANGLE CB TO FIND DISTANCE BC\r\nBETWEEN BOTTOM OF SHAFT AND OUTCROP.=--BC = AC × natural sine ACB. Or by\r\nscale and protractor by inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n     RAINFALL.\r\n\r\nOne inch of rain = 22,680 gallons, or 102·35 tons of water per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTES ON BELTING.\r\n\r\n_Co-efficient_ of friction between ordinary leather belting and\r\ncast-iron pulleys or drums = ·423. Ultimate strength of ordinary leather\r\nbelting = 3086 lb. per square inch. Belts vary from ³/₁₆ in. to ¼ in.\r\nthick, average ⁷/₃₂ in.\r\n\r\n_Power of Single Leather Belts._\r\n\r\nTo calculate the power of single leather belts, the following formula\r\nmay be used: Let HP = actual horse-power. W = width of belt. F = driving\r\nforce. T = working tension from 70 to 150 lb. V = velocity of belt in\r\nfeet per minute.\r\n\r\nThen F = (W × T)/2. HP = V × F/33,000. W = 33,000 × HP/F × V.\r\n\r\n=EXAMPLE:=--A 10-inch belt running 2500 feet per minute, what horse-power\r\nwill it transmit? Assuming the working tension to be 100 lb.,\r\n\r\nF = (10 × 100)/2 = 500. HP = (25,000 × 500)/33,000 = 378 horse-power.\r\n\r\nNystrom gives this rule:--HP = (V × F)/550. V = velocity of belt in feet\r\nper second. F = force in pounds transmitted by belt.\r\n\r\nThe first rule gives good practical results where there is no great\r\ninequality in the diameter of the pulleys.\r\n\r\n_Double Belts_ transmit 1½ times as much as single belts.\r\n\r\n_Splicing Belts._\r\n\r\n                  +----+-----+-----+-------+--------+------------+\r\n  Width of Belts. | 1  |  2  |  3  | 3 to 6| 6 to 8 | above 8 in.|\r\n  Lap in inches . | 2  |  4½ |  5½ |   6   |     8  |    10      |\r\n                  +----+-----+-----+-------+--------+------------+\r\n\r\n_Rules for Double Leather Belting._\r\n\r\nA = covered area of driven pulley in square inches.\r\n\r\nV = speed of belt in feet per minute.\r\n\r\nH = indicated horse-power.\r\n\r\nW = width in inches.\r\n\r\nH = AV/66,000 A = (66,000 H)/V. W = A/L, where L = length of belt on\r\ndriven pulley in inches.\r\n\r\nAnother authority simply says H = {70 to 80} × (WV)/33,000\r\n\r\nAnd a third says W = (36,000 H)/(6VL), where L is here in feet.\r\n\r\nEvan Leigh’s rule is W = (66,000 × IHP)/(L × V).\r\n\r\nL = length of arc of contact upon smaller pulley in inches.\r\n\r\nV = velocity of rim in feet per minute.\r\n\r\n_A belt_ transmits its motion solely through frictional contact with the\r\nsurfaces of the pulley. The lower side of the belt should be made the\r\ndriving side when possible, as the arc of contact is thereby increased\r\nby the sagging of the following side. Increase of power will be obtained\r\nby increasing the size of pulleys, the same ratio being retained. Wide\r\nbelts are less effective per unit of sectional area than narrow belts.\r\nLong belts are more effective than short ones. The proportion between\r\nthe diameters of two pulleys working together should not exceed six to\r\none. Convexity of pulleys to receive belt = ½ inch per foot wide. The\r\nwidth of pulley should equal 1·2 times width of belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speed of Belts._\r\n\r\nBelts have been employed running over 5000 feet per minute. Nothing,\r\nhowever, is gained by running belts much over 4000 feet per minute.\r\nAbout 3500 feet per minute for main belts agrees with good practice;\r\nlathe belts from 1500 to 2000 feet per minute. The life of a belt may be\r\nprolonged and its driving powers increased by keeping it in good working\r\norder. To ensure this it should be dressed on the back with castor oil\r\nevery few weeks, more or less according the dryness of the _atmosphere_\r\nin which it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n     WEIGHT AND BULK OF MATERIALS.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a cubic foot of any material is its specific gravity\r\nmultiplied by 62·425, or the weight of a cubic foot of water in pounds.\r\nTo find the specific gravity of a stone, divide its weight in air by\r\nloss of weight in water of temperature of 60° F. = specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n    Quartz crystal weighs in air               293·7 grains.\r\n       ”      ”       ”      water             180·1    ”\r\n                                               -----\r\n                         Loss in weight        113·6    ”\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\n    293·7 / 113·6 = 2·59 = Specific gravity of quartz.\r\n\r\nOne ton of quartz when solid occupies 13 cubic feet, but when broken,\r\nabout 20. Rocks when solid, as compared to the same when broken, usually\r\nincrease in volume in the ratio of 1 to 1·5 or 1 to 1·18, the increase\r\ndepending on size and form of fragments.\r\n\r\nA dwt. of gold in a cwt. of ore = 1 oz. of gold per ton of ore.\r\n\r\nFor approximate calculation a grain of gold = two pence, and a dwt.,\r\nfour shillings.\r\n\r\nIn the following table of the chemical

The theoretical velocity,\r\ntherefore, in feet per second is as the square root of the product of\r\nthe space fallen through in feet and 64·333; consequently, for 1 foot\r\nit is [Sqrt]64·333 = 8·02 feet.

NEW SOUTH WALES.\r\n\r\nBy the Mining Act of 1874, the Governor was empowered to proclaim Crown\r\nlands to be gold-fields, and to grant “miners’ rights” at a fee of\r\n10_s._, between January and June exclusive, of each year, and 5_s._\r\nafter that date in each year, subject to certain regulations to be from\r\nto time to time prescribed. All miners’ rights terminate with the last\r\nday of the year, and without a miner’s right no person is allowed to\r\nmine for gold, under a penalty not exceeding £10. Business licences may\r\nalso be granted enabling persons to occupy Crown lands within\r\ngold-fields for business purposes, on payment of a fee of £1 for a year,\r\nand 10_s._ for six months. Leases of auriferous lands may be obtained in\r\naccordance with the regulations for the time being, the rent to be fixed\r\nby the Governor in Council (£1 per acre for one to twenty-five acres\r\nalluvial and quartz reef). Special leases may be granted up to 100\r\nacres. By the regulations issued on March 31, 1882, it is enacted that\r\nany parcel of new or unworked land, taken possession of with a view of\r\nobtaining a lease, shall be efficiently and continuously worked from the\r\ndate of possession by not less than two men to four acres or less, and\r\nan additional man to every other two acres, under pain of forfeiture of\r\nthe title to the land. The holder of a miner’s right may apply for\r\nauthority to search for gold, and the holder of a mineral licence may\r\napply for authority to search for minerals on land aforesaid.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of two months the Warden may grant an authority to\r\nsearch on such land, and the holder may, within the period named in the\r\nauthority, remove from any vein or lode outcropping at the surface 28\r\nlb. weight, but must not break the ground.\r\n\r\nApplication to lease may be made and lodged with the Warden of the\r\ndistrict, or nearest Warden’s Clerk, within one month from date of\r\nauthority to search:\r\n\r\n1. By the holder of an authority to search, the area not to exceed 20\r\nacres for gold-mining, or 80 acres for other minerals.\r\n\r\n2. By the holder of a miner’s right, the area not to exceed 20 acres of\r\nordinary auriferous land, or 40 acres of alluvial auriferous land, where\r\nthe mining operations will be conducted through basaltic rock formation,\r\nor where steam machinery is necessary to contend against water, or where\r\na large outlay of money is necessary.\r\n\r\n3. By the holder of a mineral licence to mine for silver, lead, tin,\r\nantimony, the area not to exceed 80 acres.\r\n\r\n4. By the holder of a prospecting licence, within 30 days after\r\ndiscovery of an auriferous quartz vein in a prospecting area, area not\r\nto exceed 20 acres.\r\n\r\n5. By the holder of a miner’s right or mineral licence, for the purpose\r\nof cutting races, conveying water or detritus to any mine, tramway,\r\nmachine site, smelting works, water conservation, or other purpose\r\nconnected with mining.\r\n\r\nWith every application to lease, the applicant, not being the owner\r\nof the land, shall deposit for rent for first half year, 10_s._ for\r\nevery acre or part of an acre. Fees are required for the survey of the\r\nleasehold and road thereto, and also for appraising damage.\r\n\r\nThe owner may agree with the applicant to lease upon the amount of\r\ncompensation and the mode of payment of same, otherwise an appraiser\r\nappointed by the Government may assess the amount of compensation to be\r\npaid by the applicant to the owner. If the applicant fail to pay the\r\ncompensation awarded within the time specified, the application shall\r\nbecome void, and all moneys deposited shall become forfeited.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA.\r\n\r\nMiners’ rights are issued at the rate of 5_s._ per annum, and\r\nconsolidated miners’ rights may be issued on the application of the\r\nmanager or trustees of any company agreeing to work in partnership any\r\nclaims registered under the Act, on payment of a sum at the prescribed\r\nrate multiplied by the number of miners’ rights so consolidated. Miners’\r\nrights entitle the holders to take possession of, and reside on and\r\nmine, so much of the Crown lands as may be prescribed by the bylaws of\r\nthe Local Mining Board. Business licences enable the holders to occupy\r\nand carry on business on the gold-fields, on lands not exceeding one\r\nacre in extent, and are issued at £2 10_s._ for six months, and £5 for\r\ntwelve months. A lease may be granted of not more than 100 acres in one\r\nlot for such term as the Governor may determine and at a nominal rent,\r\nto any holder of a miners’ right who may be desirous to prospect for\r\ngold in any place where sinking through basalt will be necessary, and to\r\nwhich no part of any gold workings shall be nearer than five miles, one\r\nmile being allowed to be marked off for the prospecting, and the lease\r\nof 100 acres to be granted only in case of remunerative gold being\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nGold-mining leases may be granted under Part I. of the “Mines Act 1890,”\r\nof Crown lands, pastoral areas, also lands alienated in fee since\r\nDecember 29, 1884, lands licensed or leased (with right of purchase)\r\nsince December 29, 1884.\r\n\r\nLeases to mine for gold and silver may be granted under Part II. of the\r\n“Mines Act 1890,” of lands alienated in fee prior to December 29, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe rent on gold-mining leases of any lands--except lands alienated in\r\nfee prior to December 29, 1884--is at the rate of 5_s._ per acre per\r\nannum, payable half-yearly in advance; and for lands alienated in fee\r\nprior to December 29, 1884, the rent is, for any area up to 40 acres, £1\r\nper annum, payable quarterly in advance in each case. On mineral leases\r\nthe rent is not less than 3_d._ or more than £5 per acre per annum,\r\npayable half-yearly, in advance.\r\n\r\nThe amount to be lodged with an application for mining lease is £5, and\r\nsuch further sum as may be required to cover cost of survey.\r\n\r\nLicences to cut, construct, and use races, drains, dams, and reservoirs\r\nfor mining purposes, may be granted for a term not to exceed fifteen\r\nyears, at a minimum rent of £2 per annum in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOUTH AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nA miner’s right authorises the holder to prospect for any metal,\r\nmineral, coal, or oil, the property of the Crown; under a gold claim of\r\n20 acres, a mineral claim not exceeding 40 acres, and a coal or oil\r\nclaim, 640 acres. Ownership of claim confers the right to reside\r\nthereon, and preferential right to a lease.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of a gold claim are for an ordinary reef claim, 100 by\r\n600 feet, and an ordinary alluvial claim 30 by 30 feet, with a labour\r\ncondition requiring one man to be kept employed. A mineral claim of 40\r\nacres requires two men; coal and oil claims (640 acres) require eight\r\nmen. A business licence (quarter acre in township, and one acre on other\r\nland) costs 10_s._ for six months and £1 for one year. Occupation\r\nlicence (half acre), 2_s._ per annum, term fourteen years. A person may\r\nhold any number of claims (except alluvial claims, of which only one can\r\nbe held at one time), but for each claim must hold a miner’s right.\r\n\r\nGold leases not exceeding 20 acres, term forty-two years, rent 1_s._ per\r\nacre and 6_d._ in the pound on net profits; labour, one man to every 5\r\nacres. Mineral leases not exceeding 40 acres, term forty-two years, rent\r\n1_s._ per acre, and 6_d._ in the pound on net profits; labour, one man\r\nto every 10 acres. Coal and oil leases (640 acres), term forty-two\r\nyears, rent 6_d._ per acre until coal or oil is found in payable\r\nquantities, then 1_s._ per acre; labour, one man for every 40 acres.\r\nMiscellaneous lease for salt and gypsum, 40 acres; mineral springs, 20\r\nacres, and smelting works’ site, 5 acres, term forty-two years; labour\r\nfor salt and gypsum and mineral springs, two men for each 40 acres.\r\n\r\nAny number of leases may be held, but a miner’s right for each is\r\nrequired. All claims must be constantly worked, and must be registered\r\nwithin thirty days after being pegged out.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WESTERN AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 1884, amended Mining Regulations were issued, empowering\r\nthe Governor to proclaim any portion of Crown land to be a gold-field,\r\nand to appoint Wardens, who could grant miner’s rights to any person\r\nupon payment of £1 per year, authorising the holder to search and mine\r\nfor gold on any waste land upon registering the occupation of the claim\r\nwith the Warden or other duly appointed officer.\r\n\r\nAlluvial ordinary claims to comprise an area of 16 by 16 yards for one\r\nperson, ordinary river and steam claims to have a frontage of 20 yards\r\non the course of the river or stream, and a depth of 50 yards on both\r\nbanks; ordinary quartz claims not to exceed 50 feet in length on the\r\nsupposed course of the reef by a width not exceeding 400 feet. Any\r\nground taken up for mining and unoccupied and unworked for ten days to\r\nbe considered as abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 1886, “Regulations for the Management of Gold-fields” came\r\ninto operation, dealing with the conditions under which a miner desirous\r\nof prospecting may mark off and hold a protection area; also as regards\r\nalluvial claims, and the rewards to be had for discoveries of new\r\ngold-fields.\r\n\r\nBy an additional amended regulation, granted under regulations of\r\nFebruary 2, 1888, any protection area which after the date of the\r\ngrant thereof comes within the limits of a proclaimed gold-field,\r\nmay, notwithstanding such proclamation, continue to be held until the\r\nexpiration of twelve months from the date of such grant, or until\r\npayable gold on such area is discovered, which ever shall first happen.\r\nThe labour conditions must however be fully complied with, or the\r\nextension of time will cease, and the protection area will be forfeited.\r\n\r\nGold-mining leases are granted for areas not exceeding 25 acres, at an\r\nannual rent, payable in advance, of 20_s._ per acre. The term may not\r\nexceed twenty-one years. The leases are liable to cancellation unless\r\nworked by the proper number of men, or machinery power equal to the men.\r\nThe leases can be determined by giving three months’ notice, and the\r\nlessees have power to remove all machinery used on the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUEENSLAND.\r\n\r\nOn payment of 10_s._ the Governor may cause to be issued to any person\r\n(not being an Asiatic or African alien), a mining licence for one year,\r\nand on payment of the sum of £4 a business licence. All applications\r\nfor mineral leases to be made on the prescribed form, and to be\r\naccompanied by the proper survey fee and the first year’s rent. The\r\nyearly rental of every lease to be at the rate of 10_s._ per acre,\r\npayable in advance, the term not to exceed twenty-one years, but a\r\nfurther lease of twenty-one years may be granted on such terms as the\r\nMinister deems equitable. Area not to exceed 100 acres.\r\n\r\nMining without a right is punishable by removal of the offender from the\r\nfield, and the infliction of a fine of £10, or one month’s imprisonment.\r\n\r\nMiners desirous of prospecting for gold may mark off and hold protection\r\nareas, ranging according to the distance from a proclaimed gold-field of\r\n150 to 400 yards square. Such areas have to be pegged, registered, and\r\ncontinuously worked. On payable gold being found and reported to the\r\nWarden, the prospectors are entitled to a reward claim which varies from\r\ntwo to twenty claims of the ordinary area. 50 feet frontage are allowed\r\nto each miner on river and creek claims. On ordinary quartz claims, 50\r\nfeet along the line of reef, by a width of 400 feet, are allowed. The\r\nextent of ground in any lode claim not to exceed 3 chains by 5 chains,\r\nalluvial claim not to exceed 4 chains by 4 chains. This area may be\r\nincreased by the Warden when the ground is poor, or expensive machinery\r\nhas been erected. Europeans holding miners’ rights, which are granted\r\nfor ten years or less on payment of an annual rate of 10_s._, are\r\nallowed to occupy and enclose, for the purpose of residence, an area of\r\nland not exceeding a quarter of an acre, to be marked off in a\r\nrectangular block, or as near thereto as possible, the frontage of which\r\nto any road, creek, or water shall not exceed 72 feet, the boundaries to\r\nbe defined by corner pegs 3 inches in diameter and standing 18 inches\r\nout of the ground, and can also occupy, under certain conditions,\r\nmarket-garden areas not exceeding 5 acres. They are also entitled to\r\nmine in Crown lands, to make dams, races, and tramways, to divert\r\nwaters, to put up and remove any building, and to use any timber,\r\ngravel, or clay for their own building purposes. Upon erecting buildings\r\nor making improvements on a business or residence area, to the value of\r\n£5, the holder can have such area registered as exempt from the\r\ncondition of residence for a period not exceeding one year.\r\n\r\nLeases of land not exceeding 25 acres for any term not exceeding 21\r\nyears are also granted for mining purposes at a yearly rental of £1 per\r\nacre. These leases, however, are not granted on new gold-fields until\r\ntwo years after proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Mineral Lands Act of 1892, applies to lands on gold-fields and gives\r\nthe power to the holders of miner’s rights and licences to mine on land\r\nsold, subject to reservation of gold and silver, on obtaining the\r\nwritten sanction of the Warden or commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TASMANIA.\r\n\r\nA miner’s right, or prospector’s protection order, issued under the\r\nGold-fields Act (the fee for a miner’s right being 5_s._, and a\r\nprospector’s licence 10_s._ per annum), authorises the holder to reside\r\nupon a gold-field, and to occupy a quarter of an acre for residence, and\r\nentitles him to a claim for mining purposes:--Alluvial, single claim, 35\r\nyards by 35 yards; united claims, up to 10 men, 110 yards by 110 yards.\r\nCreek claims; 35 yards by 35 yards along course of creek; united claims\r\nnot to exceed six men’s area. Extended alluvial claims; 70 yards by 70\r\nyards, up to 170 yards by 170 yards for six men; also to take any\r\nquantity of water and of timber required for mining purposes. Extended\r\nalluvial claims of one acre for ground previously worked and abandoned\r\nmay be taken up. Prospecting claims, gold, not exceeding 10 acres. Fee\r\nfor registration, which is not compulsory, 2_s._ 6_d._; survey 25_s._\r\nUnited claim of 10, fee 5_s._; survey, £2. Leases not to exceed 10\r\nacres, except in special cases by permission of the Minister; term, ten\r\nyears; rent, £1 per acre. Leases may be amalgamated to the extent of 60\r\nacres. Lessee has the right to renewal for ten years, rent not to exceed\r\n£3 an acre. Fee for preparation of lease, £1; transfer, 10_s._ Survey\r\nfee, 10 acres, £3 15_s._ ordinary land; £5 10_s._ heavy bush. On the\r\nWest Coast the survey fees are: 1 acre and under, £1 15_s._; 2 acres,\r\nand under 5 acres, £3 15_s._; under 10 acres, £5 10_s._, up to a maximum\r\nof £23 for not exceeding 320 acres.\r\n\r\nLeases are liable to forfeiture by the Governor in Council if the rent\r\nis not paid in advance, or the labour conditions are not complied with.\r\n\r\nLicences to occupy land upon a gold-field, for the purpose of\r\ncultivation, are issued under the Waste Lands Acts. Area, 5 acres or\r\nunder, rent £2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\nThe price of a “miner’s right” is 10_s._ per year, which authorises the\r\nholder to mine on Crown lands throughout the colony outside of a native\r\ndistrict; and 20_s._, which authorises him to mine on native lands and\r\nCrown lands, or such other sum as shall not be less than the sum which\r\nthe Governor may have agreed to pay to the owners of the land as\r\nconsideration for the right to mine thereon. Consolidated miners’ rights\r\nare issued at the rate of a single miner’s right (10_s._), multiplied\r\nby the number of miners’ rights which the consolidated right is to\r\nrepresent.
