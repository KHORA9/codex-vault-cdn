D. HOOKER\r\n\r\nKew, _Jan_. 12_th_, 1854\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving accompanied Sir James Ross on his voyage of discovery to the\r\nAntarctic regions, where botany was my chief pursuit, on my return I\r\nearnestly desired to add to my acquaintance with the natural history of\r\nthe temperate zones, more knowledge of that of the tropics than I had\r\nhitherto had the opportunity of acquiring. My choice lay between India\r\nand the Andes, and I decided upon the former, being principally\r\ninfluenced by Dr. Falconer, who promised me every assistance which his\r\nposition as Superintendent of the H.E.I.C. Botanic Garden at Calcutta,\r\nwould enable him to give. He also drew my attention to the fact that we\r\nwere ignorant even of the geography of the central and eastern parts of\r\nthese mountains, while all to the north was involved in a mystery\r\nequally attractive to the traveller and the naturalist.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the kind interest taken by Baron Humboldt in my proposed\r\ntravels, and at the request of my father (Sir William Hooker), the Earl\r\nof Carlisle (then Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests) undertook to\r\nrepresent to Her Majesty’s Government the expediency of securing my\r\ncollections for the Royal Gardens at Kew; and owing to the generous\r\nexertions of that nobleman, and of the late Earl of Auckland (then\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty), my journey assumed the character of a\r\nGovernment mission, £400 per annum being granted by the Treasury for\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\nI did not contemplate proceeding beyond the Himalaya and Tibet, when\r\nLord Auckland desired that I should afterwards visit Borneo, for the\r\npurpose of reporting on the capabilities of Labuan, with reference to\r\nthe cultivation of cotton, tobacco, sugar, indigo, spices, guttapercha,\r\netc. To this end a commission in the navy (to which service I was\r\nalready attached) was given me, such instructions were drawn up as\r\nmight facilitate my movements in the East, and a suitable sum of money\r\nwas placed at my disposal.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving England, my plans became, from various causes,\r\naltered. The Earl of Auckland[1] was dead; the interest in Borneo had\r\nin a great measure subsided; H.M.S. “Mæander,” to which I had been\r\nattached for service in Labuan, had left the Archipelago; reports of\r\nthe unhealthy nature of the coast had excited alarm; and the results of\r\nmy researches in the Himalaya had proved of more interest and advantage\r\nthan had been anticipated. It was hence thought expedient to cancel the\r\nBorneo appointment, and to prolong my services for a third year in\r\nIndia; for which purpose a grant of £300 (originally intended for\r\ndefraying the expense of collecting only, in Borneo) was transferred as\r\nsalary for the additional year to be spent in the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n [1] It is with a melancholy satisfaction that I here record the\r\n intentions of that enlightened nobleman. The idea of turning to public\r\n account what was intended as a scientific voyage, occurred to his\r\n lordship when considering my application for official leave to proceed\r\n to India; and from the hour of my accepting the Borneo commission with\r\n which he honoured me, he displayed the most active zeal in promoting\r\n its fulfilment. He communicated to me his views as to the direction in\r\n which I should pursue my researches, furnished me with official and\r\n other information, and provided me with introductions of the most\r\n essential use.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe portion of the Himalaya best worth exploring, was selected for me\r\nboth by Lord Auckland and Dr. Falconer, who independently recommended\r\nSikkim, as being ground untrodden by traveller or naturalist. Its ruler\r\nwas, moreover, all but a dependant of the British government, and it\r\nwas supposed, would therefore be glad to facilitate my researches.\r\n\r\nNo part of the snowy Himalaya eastward of the northwest extremity of\r\nthe British possessions had been visited since Turner’s embassy to\r\nTibet in 1789; and hence it was highly important to explore\r\nscientifically a part of the chain which, from its central position,\r\nmight be presumed to be typical of the whole range. The possibility of\r\nvisiting Tibet, and of ascertaining particulars respecting the great\r\nmountain Chumulari,[2] which was only known from Turner’s account, were\r\nadditional inducements to a student of physical geography; but it was\r\nnot then known that Kinchinjunga, the loftiest known mountain on the\r\nglobe, was situated on my route, and formed a principal feature in the\r\nphysical geography of Sikkim.\r\n\r\n [2] My earliest recollections in reading are of “Turner’s Travels in\r\n Tibet,” and of “Cook’s Voyages.” The account of Lama worship and of\r\n Chumulari in the one, and of Kerguelen’s Land in the other, always\r\n took a strong hold on my fancy. It is, therefore, singular that\r\n Kerguelen’s Land should have been the first strange country I ever\r\n visited (now fourteen years ago), and that in the first King’s ship\r\n which has touched there since Cook’s voyage, and whilst following the\r\n track of that illustrious navigator in south polar discovery. At a\r\n later period I have been nearly the first European who has approached\r\n Chumulari since Turner’s embassy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy passage to Egypt was provided by the Admiralty in H.M. steam-vessel\r\n“Sidon,” destined to convey the Marquis of Dalhousie, Governor-General\r\nof India, thus far on his way. On his arrival in Egypt, his Lordship\r\ndid me the honour of desiring me to consider myself in the position of\r\none of his suite, for the remainder of the voyage, which was performed\r\nin the “Moozuffer,” a steam frigate belonging to the Indian Navy. My\r\nobligations to this nobleman had commenced before leaving England, by\r\nhis promising me every facility he could command; and he thus took the\r\nearliest opportunity of affording it, by giving me such a position near\r\nhimself as ensured me the best reception everywhere; no other\r\nintroduction being needed. His Lordship procured my admission into\r\nSikkim, and honoured me throughout my travels with the kindest\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage out, some days were spent in Egypt, at Aden, Ceylon,\r\nand Madras. I have not thought it necessary to give here the\r\nobservations made in those well-known countries; they are detailed in a\r\nseries of letters published in the “London Journal of Botany,” as\r\nwritten for my private friends. Arriving at Calcutta in January, I\r\npassed the remainder of the cold season in making myself acquainted\r\nwith the vegetation of the plains and hills of Western Bengal, south of\r\nthe Ganges, by a journey across the mountains of Birbhoom and Behar to\r\nthe Soane valley, and thence over the Vindhya range to the Ganges, at\r\nMirzapore, whence I descended that stream to Bhaugulpore; and leaving\r\nmy boat, struck north to the Sikkim Himalaya. This excursion is\r\ndetailed in the “London Journal of Botany,” and the Asiatic Society of\r\nBengal honoured me by printing the meteorological observations made\r\nduring its progress.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years’ residence in Sikkim which succeeded, I was laid\r\nunder obligations of no ordinary nature to Brian H. Hodgson, Esq.,\r\nB.C.S., for many years Resident at the Nepal Court; whose guest I\r\nbecame for several months. Mr. Hodgson’s high position as a man of\r\nscience requires no mention here; but the difficulties he overcame, and\r\nthe sacrifices he made, in attaining that position, are known to few.\r\nHe entered the wilds of Nepal when very young, and in indifferent\r\nhealth; and finding time to spare, cast about for the best method of\r\nemploying it: he had no one to recommend or direct a pursuit, no\r\nexample to follow, no rival to equal or surpass; he had never been\r\nacquainted with a scientific man, and knew nothing of science except\r\nthe name. The natural history of men and animals, in its most\r\ncomprehensive sense, attracted his attention; he sent to Europe for\r\nbooks, and commenced the study of ethnology and zoology. His labours\r\nhave now extended over upwards of twenty-five years’ residence in the\r\nHimalaya. During this period he has seldom had a staff of less than\r\nfrom ten to twenty persons (often many more), of various tongues and\r\nraces, employed as translators and collectors, artists, shooters, and\r\nstuffers. By unceasing exertions and a princely liberality, Mr. Hodgson\r\nhas unveiled the mysteries of the Boodhist religion, chronicled the\r\naffinities, languages, customs, and faiths of the Himalayan tribes; and\r\ncompleted a natural history of the animals and birds of these regions.\r\nHis collections of specimens are immense, and are illustrated by\r\ndrawings and descriptions taken from life, with remarks on the\r\nanatomy,[3] habits, and localities of the animals themselves. Twenty\r\nvolumes of the Journals, and the Museum of the Asiatic Society of\r\nBengal, teem with the proofs of his indefatigable zeal; and throughout\r\nthe cabinets of the bird and quadruped departments of our national\r\nmuseum, Mr. Hodgson’s name stands pre-eminent. A seat in the Institute\r\nof France, and the cross of the Legion of Honour, prove the estimation\r\nin which his Boodhist studies are held on the continent of Europe. To\r\nbe welcomed to the Himalaya by such a person, and to be allowed the\r\nmost unreserved intercourse, and the advantage of all his information\r\nand library, exercised a material influence on the progress I made in\r\nmy studies, and on my travels. When I add that many of the subjects\r\ntreated of in these volumes were discussed between us, it will be\r\nevident that it is impossible for me to divest much of the information\r\nthus insensibly obtained, of the appearance of being the fruits of my\r\nown research.\r\n\r\n [3] In this department he availed himself of the services of Dr.\r\n Campbell, who was also attached to the Residency at Nepal, as surgeon\r\n and assistant political agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell, the Superintendent of Dorjiling, is likewise the\r\nGovernor-General’s agent, or medium of communication between the\r\nBritish Government and the Sikkim Rajah; and as such, invested with\r\nmany discretionary powers. In the course of this narrative, I shall\r\ngive a sketch of the rise, progress, and prospects of the Sanatarium,\r\nor Health-station of Dorjiling, and of the anomalous position held by\r\nthe Sikkim Rajah. The latter circumstance led indirectly to the\r\ndetention of Dr. Campbell (who joined me in one of my journeys) and\r\nmyself, by a faction of the Sikkim court, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nfrom the Indian Government a more favourable treaty than that then\r\nexisting. This mode of enforcing a request by _douce violence_ and\r\ndetention, is common with the turbulent tribes east of Nepal, but was\r\nin this instance aggravated by violence towards my fellow-prisoner,\r\nthrough the ill will of the persons who executed the orders of their\r\nsuperiors, and who had been punished by Dr. Campbell for crimes\r\ncommitted against both the British and Nepalese governments. The\r\ncircumstances of this outrage were misunderstood at the time; its\r\ninstigators were supposed to be Chinese; its perpetrators Tibetans; and\r\nwe the offenders were assumed to have thrust ourselves into the\r\ncountry, without authority from our own government, and contrary to the\r\nwill of the Sikkim Rajah; who was imagined to be a tributary of China,\r\nand protected by that nation, and to be under no obligation to the East\r\nIndian government.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the obligations I owe to Dr. Campbell, I confine myself\r\nto saying that his whole aim was to promote my comfort, and to secure\r\nmy success, in all possible ways. Every object I had in view was as\r\nsedulously cared for by him as by myself: I am indebted to his\r\ninfluence with Jung Bahadoor[4] for the permission to traverse his\r\ndominions, and to visit the Tibetan passes of Nepal. His prudence and\r\npatience in negotiating with the Sikkim court, enabled me to pursue my\r\ninvestigations in that country. My journal is largely indebted to his\r\nvaried and extensive knowledge of the people and productions of these\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n [4] It was in Nepal that Dr. Campbell gained the friendship of Jung\r\n Bahadoor, the most remarkable proof of which is the acceding to his\r\n request, and granting me leave to visit the eastern parts of his\r\n dominions; no European that I am aware of, having been allowed, either\r\n before or since, to travel anywhere except to and from the plains of\r\n India and valley of Katmandu, in which the capital city and British\r\n residency are situated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all numerical calculations connected with my observations, I\r\nreceived most essential aid from John Muller, Esq., Accountant of the\r\nCalcutta Mint, and from his brother, Charles Muller, Esq., of Patna,\r\nboth ardent amateurs in scientific pursuits, and who employed\r\nthemselves in making meteorological observations at Dorjiling, where\r\nthey were recruiting constitutions impaired by the performance of\r\narduous duties in the climate of the plains. I cannot sufficiently\r\nthank these gentlemen for the handsome manner in which they volunteered\r\nme their assistance in these laborious operations. Mr. J. Muller\r\nresided at Dorjiling during eighteen months of my stay in Sikkim, over\r\nthe whole of which period his generous zeal in my service never\r\nrelaxed; he assisted me in the reduction of many hundreds of my\r\nobservations for latitude, time, and elevation, besides adjusting and\r\nrating my instruments; and I can recall no more pleasant days than\r\nthose thus spent with these hospitable friends.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dr. Falconer’s indefatigable exertions, such of my\r\ncollections as reached Calcutta were forwarded to England in excellent\r\norder; and they were temporarily deposited in Kew Gardens until their\r\ndestination should be determined. On my return home, my scientific\r\nfriends interested themselves in procuring from the Government such aid\r\nas might enable me to devote the necessary time to the arrangement,\r\nnaming, and distributing of my collections, the publication of my\r\nmanuscripts, etc. I am in this most deeply indebted to the\r\ndisinterested and generous exertions of Mr. L. Horner, Sir Charles\r\nLyell, Dr. Lindley, Professor E. Forbes, and many others; and most\r\nespecially to the Presidents of the Royal Society (the Earl of Rosse),\r\nof the Linnean (Mr. R. Brown), and Geological (Mr. Hopkins), who in\r\ntheir official capacities memorialized in person the Chief Commissioner\r\nof Woods and Forests on this subject; Sir William Hooker at the same\r\ntime bringing it under the notice of the First Lord of the Treasury.\r\nThe result was a grant of £400 annually for three years.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Thomson joined me in Dorjiling in the end of 1849, after the\r\ncompletion of his arduous journeys in the North-West Himalaya and\r\nTibet, and we spent the year 1850 in travelling and collecting,\r\nreturning to England together in 1851. Having obtained permission from\r\nthe Indian Government to distribute his botanical collections, which\r\nequal my own in extent and value, we were advised by all our botanical\r\nfriends to incorporate, and thus to distribute them. The whole\r\nconstitute an Herbarium of from 6000 to 7000 species of Indian plants,\r\nincluding an immense number of duplicates; and it is now in process of\r\nbeing arranged and named, by Dr. Thomson and myself, preparatory to its\r\ndistribution amongst sixty of the principal public and private herbaria\r\nin Europe, India, and the United States of America.\r\n\r\nFor the information of future travellers, I may state that the total\r\nexpense of my Indian journey, including outfit, three years and a half\r\ntravelling, and the sending of my collections to Calcutta, was under\r\n£2000 (of which £1200 were defrayed by government), but would have come\r\nto much more, had I not enjoyed the great advantages I have detailed.\r\nThis sum does not include the purchase of books and instruments, with\r\nwhich I supplied myself, and which cost about £200, nor the freight of\r\nthe collections to England, which was paid by Government. Owing to the\r\nkind services of Mr. J. C. Melvill, Secretary of the India House, many\r\nsmall parcels of seeds, etc., were conveyed to England, free of cost;\r\nand I have to record my great obligations and sincere thanks to the\r\nPeninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, for conveying,\r\nwithout charge, all small parcels of books, instruments and specimens,\r\naddressed to or by myself.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say something of the illustrations of this work. The maps\r\nare from surveys of my own, made chiefly with my own instruments, but\r\npartly with some valuable ones for the use of which I am indebted to my\r\nfriend Captain H. Thuillier, Deputy Surveyor-General of India, who\r\nplaced at my disposal the resources of the magnificent establishment\r\nunder his control, and to whose innumerable good offices I am very\r\ngreatly beholden.\r\n\r\nThe landscapes, etc. have been prepared chiefly from my own drawings,\r\nand will, I hope, be found to be tolerably faithful representations of\r\nthe scenes. I have always endeavoured to overcome that tendency to\r\nexaggerate heights, and increase the angle of slopes, which is I\r\nbelieve the besetting sin, not of amateurs only, but of our most\r\naccomplished artists. As, however, I did not use instruments in\r\nprojecting the outlines, I do not pretend to have wholly avoided this\r\nsnare; nor, I regret to say; has the lithographer, in all cases, been\r\ncontent to abide by his copy. My drawings will be considered tame\r\ncompared with most mountain landscapes, though the subjects comprise\r\nsome of the grandest scenes in nature. Considering how conventional the\r\ntreatment of such subjects is, and how unanimous artists seem to be as\r\nto the propriety of exaggerating those features which should\r\npredominate in the landscape, it may fairly be doubted whether the\r\ntotal effect of steepness and elevation, especially in a mountain view,\r\ncan, on a small scale, be conveyed by a strict adherence to truth. I\r\nneed hardly add, that if such is attainable, it is only by those who\r\nhave a power of colouring that few pretend to. In the list of plates\r\nand woodcuts I have mentioned the obligations I am under to several\r\nfriends for the use of drawings, etc.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spelling of native names, after much anxious\r\ndiscussion I have adopted that which assimilates most to the English\r\npronunciation. For great assistance in this, for a careful revision of\r\nthe sheets as they passed through the press, and for numerous valuable\r\nsuggestions throughout, I am indebted to my fellow-traveller, Dr.\r\nThomas Thomson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Kinchinjunga from Singtam, looking\r\nnorth-westward]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\nSunderbunds vegetation—Calcutta Botanic Garden—Leave for\r\nBurdwan—Rajah’s gardens and menagerie—Coal-beds, geology, and plants\r\nof—Lac insect and plant—Camels—Kunker—Cowage—Effloresced soda on\r\nsoil—Glass, manufacture of—Atmospheric vapours—Temperature, etc.—Mahowa\r\noil and spirits—Maddaobund—Jains—Ascent of Paras-nath—Vegetation of\r\nthat mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\nI left England on the 11th of November, 1847, and performed the voyage\r\nto India under circumstances which have been detailed in the\r\nIntroduction. On the 12th of January, 1848, the “Moozuffer” was\r\nsteaming amongst the low swampy islands of the Sunderbunds. These\r\nexhibit no tropical luxuriance, and are, in this respect, exceedingly\r\ndisappointing. A low vegetation covers them, chiefly made up of a\r\ndwarf-palm (_Phœnix paludosa_) and small mangroves, with a few\r\nscattered trees on the higher bank that runs along the water’s edge,\r\nconsisting of fan-palm, toddy-palm, and _Terminalia._ Every now and\r\nthen, the paddles of the steamer tossed up the large fruits of _Nipa\r\nfruticans,_ a low stemless palm that grows in the tidal waters of the\r\nIndian ocean, and bears a large head of nuts. It is a plant of no\r\ninterest to the common observer, but of much to the geologist, from the\r\nnuts of a similar plant abounding in the tertiary formations at the\r\nmouth of the Thames, and having floated about there in as great\r\nprofusion as here, till buried deep in the silt and mud that now forms\r\nthe island of Sheppey.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] Bowerbank “On the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of the Isle of Sheppey,”\r\n and Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” 3rd ed. p. 201.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigher up, the river Hoogly is entered, and large trees, with villages\r\nand cultivation, replace the sandy spits and marshy jungles of the\r\ngreat Gangetic delta. A few miles below Calcutta, the scenery becomes\r\nbeautiful, beginning with the Botanic Garden, once the residence of\r\nRoxburgh and Wallich, and now of Falconer,—classical ground to the\r\nnaturalist. Opposite are the gardens of Sir Lawrence Peel; unrivalled\r\nin India for their beauty and cultivation, and fairly entitled to be\r\ncalled the Chatsworth of Bengal. A little higher up, Calcutta opened\r\nout, with the batteries of Fort William in the foreground, thundering\r\nforth a salute, and in a few minutes more all other thoughts were\r\nabsorbed in watching the splendour of the arrangements made for the\r\nreception of the Governor-General of India.\r\n\r\nDuring my short stay in Calcutta, I was principally occupied in\r\npreparing for an excursion with Mr. Williams of the Geological Survey,\r\nwho was about to move his camp from the Damooda valley coal-fields,\r\nnear Burdwan, to Beejaghur on the banks of the Soane, where coal was\r\nreported to exist, in the immediate vicinity of water-carriage, the\r\ngreat desideratum of the Burdwan fields.\r\n\r\nMy time was spent partly at Government-House, and partly at Sir\r\nLawrence Peel’s residence. The former I was kindly invited to consider\r\nas my Indian home, an honour which I appreciate the more highly, as the\r\ninvitation was accompanied with the assurance that I should have entire\r\nfreedom to follow my own pursuits; and the advantages which such a\r\nposition afforded me, were, I need not say, of no ordinary kind.\r\n\r\nAt the Botanic Gardens I received every assistance from Dr.\r\nMcLelland,[6] who was very busy, superintending the publication of the\r\nbotanical papers and drawings of his friend, the late Dr. Griffith, for\r\nwhich native artists were preparing copies on lithographic paper.\r\n\r\n [6] Dr. Falconer’s _locum tenens,_ then in temporary charge of the\r\n establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Gardens themselves it is exceedingly difficult to speak; the\r\nchanges had been so very great, and from a state with which I had no\r\nacquaintance. There had been a great want of judgment in the\r\nalterations made since Dr. Wallich’s time, when they were celebrated as\r\nthe most beautiful gardens in the east, and were the great object of\r\nattraction to strangers and townspeople. I found instead an unsightly\r\nwilderness, without shade (the first requirement of every tropical\r\ngarden) or other beauties than some isolated grand trees, which had\r\nsurvived the indiscriminate destruction of the useful and ornamental\r\nwhich had attended the well-meant but ill-judged attempt to render a\r\ngarden a botanical class-book. It is impossible to praise too highly\r\nDr. Griffith’s abilities and acquirements as a botanist, his\r\nperseverance and success as a traveller, or his matchless industry in\r\nthe field and in the closet; and it is not wonderful, that, with so\r\nmany and varied talents, he should have wanted the eye of a\r\nlandscape-gardener, or the education of a horticulturist. I should,\r\nhowever, be wanting in my duty to his predecessor, and to his no less\r\nillustrious successor, were these remarks withheld, proceeding, as they\r\ndo, from an unbiassed observer, who had the honour of standing in an\r\nequally friendly relation to all parties. Before leaving India, I saw\r\ngreat improvements, but many years must elapse before the gardens can\r\nresume their once proud pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find the Botanical Gardens looked upon by many of\r\nthe Indian public, and even by some of the better informed official\r\nmen, as rather an extravagant establishment, more ornamental than\r\nuseful. These persons seemed astonished to learn that its name was\r\nrenowned throughout Europe, and that during the first twenty years\r\nespecially of Dr. Wallich’s superintendence, it had contributed more\r\nuseful and ornamental tropical plants to the public and private gardens\r\nof the world than any other establishment before or since.[7] I speak\r\nfrom a personal knowledge of the contents of our English gardens, and\r\nour colonial ones at the Cape, and in Australia, and from an inspection\r\nof the ponderous volumes of distribution lists, to which Dr. Falconer\r\nis daily adding. The botanical public of Europe and India is no less\r\nindebted than the horticultural to the liberality of the Hon. East\r\nIndia Company, and to the energy of the several eminent men who have\r\ncarried their views into execution.[8] The Indian government, itself,\r\nhas already profited largely by these gardens, directly and indirectly,\r\nand might have done so still more, had its efforts been better seconded\r\neither by the European or native population of the country. Amongst its\r\ngreatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant\r\nfrom China, a fact I allude to, as many of my English readers may not\r\nbe aware that the establishment of the tea-trade in the Himalaya and\r\nAssam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens\r\nof Calcutta and Seharunpore.\r\n\r\n [7] As an illustration of this, I may refer to a Report presented to\r\n the government of Bengal, from which it appears that between January,\r\n 1836, and December, 1840, 189,932 plants were distributed gratis to\r\n nearly 2000 different gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] I here allude to the great Indian herbarium, chiefly formed by the\r\n staff of the Botanic Gardens under the direction of Dr. Wallich, and\r\n distributed in 1829 to the principal museums of Europe. This is the\r\n most valuable contribution of the kind ever made to science, and it is\r\n a lasting memorial: of the princely liberality of the enlightened men\r\n who ruled the counsels of India in those days. No botanical work of\r\n importance has been published since 1829, without recording its sense\r\n of the obligation, and I was once commissioned by a foreign\r\n government, to purchase for its national museum, at whatever cost, one\r\n set of these collections, which was brought to the hammer on the death\r\n of its possessor. I have heard it remarked that the expense attending\r\n the distribution was enormous, and I have reason to know that this\r\n erroneous impression has had an unfavourable influence upon the\r\n destination of scarcely less valuable collections, which have for\r\n years been lying untouched in the cellars of the India House. I may\r\n add that officers who have exposed their lives and impaired their\r\n health in forming similar ones at the orders and expense of the Indian\r\n government, are at home, and thrown upon their own resources, or the\r\n assistance of their scientific brethren, for the means of publishing\r\n and distributing the fruits of their labours.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom no one did I receive more kindness than from Sir James Colvile,\r\nPresident of the Asiatic Society, who not only took care that I should\r\nbe provided with every comfort, but presented me with a completely\r\nequipped palkee, which, for strength and excellence of construction,\r\nwas everything that a traveller could desire. Often _en route_ did I\r\nmentally thank him when I saw other palkees breaking down, and\r\ntravellers bewailing the loss of those forgotten necessaries, with\r\nwhich his kind attention had furnished me.\r\n\r\nI left Calcutta to join Mr. Williams’ camp on the 28th of January,\r\ndriving to Hoogly on the river of that name, and thence following the\r\ngrand trunk-road westward towards Burdwan. The novelty of\r\npalkee-travelling at first renders it pleasant; the neatness with which\r\nevery thing is packed, the good-humour of the bearers, their merry\r\npace, and the many more comforts enjoyed than could be expected in a\r\nconveyance _horsed by men_, the warmth when the sliding doors are shut,\r\nand the breeze when they are open, are all fully appreciated on first\r\nstarting, but soon the novelty wears off, and the discomforts are so\r\nnumerous, that it is pronounced, at best, a barbarous conveyance. The\r\ngreedy cry and gestures of the bearers, when, on changing, they break a\r\nfitful sleep by poking a torch in your face, and vociferating\r\n“Bucksheesh, Sahib;” their discontent at the most liberal largesse, and\r\nthe sluggishness of the next set who want bribes, put the traveller out\r\nof patience with the natives. The dust when the slides are open, and\r\nthe stifling heat when shut during a shower, are conclusive against the\r\nvehicle, and on getting out with aching bones and giddy head at the\r\njourney’s end, I shook the dust from my person, and wished never to see\r\na palkee again.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I was passing through the straggling villages\r\nclose to Burdwan, consisting of native hovels by the road side, with\r\nmangos and figs planted near them, and palms waving over their roofs.\r\nCrossing the nearly dry bed of the Damooda, I was set down at Mr.\r\nM‘Intosh’s (the magistrate of the district), and never more thoroughly\r\nenjoyed a hearty welcome and a breakfast.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we visited the Rajah of Burdwan’s palace and\r\npleasure-grounds, where I had the first glimpse of oriental gardening:\r\nthe roads were generally raised, running through rice fields, now dry\r\nand hard, and bordered with trees of Jack, Bamboo, _Melia, Casuarina,_\r\netc. Tanks were the prominent features: chains of them, full of Indian\r\nwater-lilies, being fringed with rows of the fan-palm, and occasionally\r\nthe Indian date. Close to the house was a rather good menagerie, where\r\nI saw, amongst other animals, a pair of kangaroos in high health and\r\ncondition, the female with young in her pouch. Before dark I was again\r\nin my palkee, and hurrying onwards. The night was cool and clear, very\r\ndifferent from the damp and foggy atmosphere I had left at Calcutta. On\r\nthe following morning I was travelling over a flat and apparently\r\nrising country, along an excellent road, with groves of bamboos and\r\nstunted trees on either hand, few villages or palms, a sterile soil,\r\nwith stunted grass and but little cultivation; altogether a country as\r\nunlike what I had expected to find in India as well might be. All\r\naround was a dead flat or table-land, out of which a few conical hills\r\nrose in the west, about 1000 feet high, covered with a low forest of\r\ndusky green or yellow, from the prevalence of bamboo. The lark was\r\nsinging merrily at sunrise, and the accessories of a fresh air and dewy\r\ngrass more reminded me of some moorland in the north of England than of\r\nthe torrid regions of the east.\r\n\r\nAt 10 p.m. I arrived at Mr. Williams’ camp, at Taldangah, a dawk\r\nstation near the western limit of the coal basin of the Damooda valley.\r\nHis operations being finished, he was prepared to start, having kindly\r\nwaited a couple of days for my arrival.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the last day of January, a motley group of\r\nnatives were busy striking the tents, and loading the bullocks,\r\nbullock-carts and elephants: these proceeded on the march, occupying in\r\nstraggling groups nearly three miles of road, whilst we remained to\r\nbreakfast with Mr. F. Watkins, Superintendent of the East India Coal\r\nand Coke Company, who were working the seams.\r\n\r\nThe coal crops out at the surface; but the shafts worked are sunk\r\nthrough thick beds of alluvium. The age of these coal-fields is quite\r\nunknown, and I regret to say that my examination of their fossil plants\r\nthrows no material light on the subject. Upwards of thirty species of\r\nfossil plants have been procured from them, and of these the majority\r\nare referred by Dr. McLelland[9] to the inferior oolite epoch of\r\nEngland, from the prevalence of species of _Zamia, Glossopteris,_ and\r\n_Taeniopteris._ Some of these genera, together with _Vertebraria_ (a\r\nvery remarkable Indian fossil), are also recognised in the coal-fields\r\nof Sind and of Australia. I cannot, however, think that botanical\r\nevidence of such a nature is sufficient to warrant a satisfactory\r\nreference of these Indian coal-fields to the same epoch as those of\r\nEngland or of Australia; in the first place the outlines of the fronds\r\nof ferns and their nervation are frail characters if employed alone for\r\nthe determination of existing genera, and much more so of fossil\r\nfragments: in the second place recent ferns are so widely distributed,\r\nthat an inspection of the majority affords little clue to the region or\r\nlocality they come from: and in the third place, considering the wide\r\ndifference in latitude and longitude of Yorkshire, India, and\r\nAustralia, the natural conclusion is that they could not have supported\r\na similar vegetation at the same epoch. In fact, finding similar fossil\r\nplants at places widely different in latitude, and hence in climate,\r\nis, in the present state of our knowledge, rather an argument against\r\nthan for their having existed cotemporaneously. The _Cycadeæ,_\r\nespecially, whose fossil remains afford so much ground for geological\r\nspeculations, are far from yielding such precise data as is supposed.\r\nSpecies of the order are found in Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and\r\nIndia, some inhabiting the hottest and dampest, and others the driest\r\nclimates on the surface of the globe; and it appears to me rash to\r\nargue much from the presence of the order in the coal of Yorkshire and\r\nIndia, when we reflect that the geologist of some future epoch may find\r\nas good reasons for referring the present Cape, Australian, or Mexican\r\nFlora to the same period as that of the Lias and Oolites, when the\r\n_Cycadeæ_ now living in the former countries shall be fossilised.\r\n\r\n [9] Reports of the Geological Survey of India. Calcutta, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific identity of their contained fossils may be considered as fair\r\nevidence of the cotemporaneous origin of beds, but amongst the many\r\ncollections of fossil plants that I have examined, there is hardly a\r\nspecimen, belonging to any epoch, sufficiently perfect to warrant the\r\nassumption that the species to which it belonged can be again\r\nrecognised. The botanical evidences which geologists too often accept\r\nas proofs of specific identity are such as no botanist would attach any\r\nimportance to in the investigation of existing plants. The faintest\r\ntraces assumed to be of vegetable origin are habitually made into\r\ngenera and species by naturalists ignorant of the structure, affinities\r\nand distribution of living plants, and of such materials the bulk of\r\nso-called systems of fossil plants is composed.\r\n\r\nA number of women were here employed in making gunpowder, grinding the\r\nusual materials on a stone, with the addition of water from the Hookah;\r\na custom for which they have an obstinate prejudice. The charcoal here\r\nused is made from an _Acacia_: the Seiks, I believe, employ _Justicia\r\nAdhatoda,_ which is also in use all over India: at Aden the Arabs\r\nprefer the _Calotropis_, probably because it is most easily procured.\r\nThe grain of all these plants is open, whereas in England,\r\ncloser-grained and more woody trees, especially willows, are preferred.\r\n\r\nThe jungle I found to consist chiefly of thorny bushes, Jujube of two\r\nspecies, an _Acacia_ and _Butea frondosa,_ the twigs of the latter\r\noften covered with lurid red tears of Lac, which is here collected in\r\nabundance. As it occurs on the plants and is collected by the natives\r\nit is called Stick-lac, but after preparation Shell-lac. In Mirzapore,\r\na species of _Celtis_ yields it, and the Peepul very commonly in\r\nvarious parts of India. The elaboration of this dye, whether by the\r\nsame species of insect, or by many from plants so widely different in\r\nhabit and characters, is a very curious fact; since none have red\r\njuice, but some have milky and others limpid.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Mr. Williams and I started on an elephant, following\r\nthe camp to Gyra, twelve miles distant. The docility of these animals\r\nis an old story, but it loses so much in the telling, that their\r\ngentleness, obedience, and sagacity seemed as strange to me as if I had\r\nnever heard or read of these attributes. The swinging motion, under a\r\nhot sun, is very oppressive, but compensated for by being so high above\r\nthe dust. The Mahout, or driver, guides by poking his great toes under\r\neither ear, enforcing obedience with an iron goad, with which he\r\nhammers the animal’s head with quite as much force as would break a\r\ncocoa-nut, or drives it through his thick skin down to the quick. A\r\nmost disagreeable sight it is, to see the blood and yellow fat oozing\r\nout in the broiling sun from these great punctures! Our elephant was an\r\nexcellent one, when he did not take obstinate fits, and so docile as to\r\npick up pieces of stone when desired, and with a jerk of the trunk\r\nthrow them over his head for the rider to catch, thus saving the\r\ntrouble of dismounting to geologise!\r\n\r\nOf sights on the road, unfrequented though this noble line is, there\r\nwere plenty for a stranger; chiefly pilgrims to Juggernath, most on\r\nfoot, and a few in carts or pony gigs of rude construction. The\r\nvehicles from the upper country are distinguished by a far superior\r\nbuild, their horses are caparisoned with jingling bells, and the wheels\r\nand other parts are bound with brass. The kindness of the people\r\ntowards animals, and in some cases towards their suffering relations,\r\nis very remarkable, and may in part have given origin to the prevalent\r\nidea that they are less cruel and stern than the majority of mankind;\r\nbut that the “mild” Hindoo, however gentle on occasion, is cruel and\r\nvindictive to his brother man and to animals, when his indolent temper\r\nis roused or his avarice stimulated, no one can doubt who reads the\r\naccounts of Thuggee, Dacoitee, and poisoning, and witnesses the cruelty\r\nwith which beasts of burthen are treated. A child carrying a bird, kid,\r\nor lamb, is not an uncommon sight, and a woman with a dog in her arms\r\nis still more frequently seen. Occasionally too, a group will bear an\r\nold man to see Juggernath before he dies, or a poor creature with\r\nelephantiasis, who hopes to be allowed to hurry himself to his\r\nparadise, in preference to lingering in helpless inactivity, and at\r\nlast crawling up to the second heaven only. The costumes are as various\r\nas the religious castes, and the many countries to which the travellers\r\nbelong. Next in wealth to the merchants, the most thriving-looking\r\nwanderer is the bearer of Ganges’ holy water, who drives a profitable\r\ntrade, his gains increasing as his load lightens, for the further he\r\nwanders from the sacred stream, the more he gets for the contents of\r\nhis jar.\r\n\r\nOf merchandise we passed very little, the Ganges being still the high\r\nroad between north-west India and Bengal. Occasionally a string of\r\ncamels was seen, but, owing to the damp climate, these are rare, and\r\nunknown east of the meridian of Calcutta. A little cotton, clumsily\r\npacked in ragged bags, dirty, and deteriorating every day, even at this\r\ndry season, proves in how bad a state it must arrive at the market\r\nduring the rains, when the low wagons are dragged through the streams.\r\n\r\nThe roads here are all mended with a curious stone, called Kunker,\r\nwhich is a nodular concretionary deposit of limestone, abundantly\r\nimbedded in the alluvial soil of a great part of India.[10] It\r\nresembles a coarse gravel, each pebble being often as large as a\r\nwalnut, and tuberculated on the surface: it binds admirably, and forms\r\nexcellent roads, but pulverises into a most disagreeable impalpable\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n [10] Often occurring in strata, like flints.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few miles beyond Taldangah we passed from the sandstone, in which the\r\ncoal lies, to a very barren country of gneiss and granite rocks, upon\r\nwhich the former rests; the country still rising, more hills appear,\r\nand towering far above all is Paras-nath, the culminant point, and a\r\nmountain whose botany I was most anxious to explore.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of this part of the country is very poor, no good-sized\r\ntrees are to be seen, all is a low stunted jungle. The grasses were\r\nfew, and dried up, except in the beds of the rivulets. On the low\r\njungly hills the same plants appear, with a few figs, bamboo in great\r\nabundance, several handsome _Acanthaceæ_; a few _Asclepiadeæ_ climbing\r\nup the bushes; and the Cowage plant, now with over-ripe pods, by\r\nshaking which, in passing, there often falls such a shower of its\r\nirritating microscopic hairs, as to make the skin tingle for an hour.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February, we moved on to Gyra, another insignificant\r\nvillage. The air was cool, and the atmosphere clear. The temperature,\r\nat three in the morning, was 65°, with no dew, the grass only 61°. As\r\nthe sun rose, Parasnath appeared against the clear grey sky, in the\r\nform of a beautiful broad cone, with a rugged peak, of a deeper grey\r\nthan the sky. It is a remarkably handsome mountain, sufficiently lofty\r\nto be imposing, rising out of an elevated country, the slope of which,\r\nupward to the base of the mountain, though imperceptible, is really\r\nconsiderable; and it is surrounded by lesser hills of just sufficient\r\nelevation to set it off. The atmosphere, too, of these regions is\r\npeculiarly favourable for views: it is very dry at this season; but\r\nstill the hills are clearly defined, without the harsh outlines so\r\ncharacteristic of a moist air. The skies are bright, the sun powerful;\r\nand there is an almost imperceptible haze that seems to soften the\r\nlandscape, and keep every object in true perspective.\r\n\r\nOur route led towards the picturesque hills and valleys in front. The\r\nrocks were all hornblende and micaceous schist, cut through by\r\ntrap-dykes, while great crumbling masses (or bosses) of quartz\r\nprotruded through the soil. The stratified rocks were often exposed,\r\npitched up at various inclinations: they were frequently white with\r\neffloresced salts, which entering largely into the composition tended\r\nto hasten their decomposition, and being obnoxious to vegetation,\r\nrendered the sterile soil more hungry still. There was little\r\ncultivation, and that little of the most wretched kind; even\r\nrice-fields were few and scattered; there was no corn, or gram (_Ervum\r\nLens_), no Castor-oil, no Poppy, Cotton, Safflower, or other crops of\r\nthe richer soils that flank the Ganges and Hoogly; a very little\r\nSugar-cane, Dhal (_Cajana_), Mustard, Linseed, and Rape, the latter\r\nthree cultivated for their oil. Hardly a Palm was to be seen; and it\r\nwas seldom that the cottages could boast of a Banana, Tamarind, Orange,\r\nCocoa-nut or Date. The Mahowa (_Bassia latifolia_) and Mango were the\r\ncommonest trees. There being no Kunker in the soil here, the roads were\r\nmended with angular quartz, much to the elephants’ annoyance.\r\n\r\nWe dismounted where some very micaceous stratified rock cropped out,\r\npowdered with a saline efflorescence.[11] Jujubes (_Zizyphus_)\r\nprevailed, with the _Carissa carandas_ (in fruit), a shrub belonging to\r\nthe usually poisonous family of Dog-banes (_Apocyneæ_); its berries\r\nmake good tarts, and the plant itself forms tolerable hedges.\r\n\r\n [11] An impure carbonate of soda. This earth is thrown into clay\r\n vessels with water, which after dissolving the soda, is allowed to\r\n evaporate, when the remainder is collected, and found to contain so\r\n much silica, as to be capable of being fused into glass. Dr. Boyle\r\n mentions this curious fact (Essay on the Arts and Manufactures of\r\n India, read before the Society of Arts, February 18, 1852), in\r\n illustration of the probably early epoch at which the natives of\r\n British India were acquainted with the art of making glass. More\r\n complicated processes are employed, and have been from a very early\r\n period, in other parts of the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country around Fitcoree is rather pretty, the hills covered with\r\nbamboo and brushwood, and as usual, rising rather suddenly from the\r\nelevated plains. The jungle affords shelter to a few bears and tigers,\r\njackals in abundance, and occasionally foxes; the birds seen are\r\nchiefly pigeons. Insects are very scarce; those of the locust tribe\r\nbeing most prevalent, indicative of a dry climate.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at 3 a.m. was 65°; at 3 p.m. 82° and at 10 p.m., 68°,\r\nfrom which there was no great variation during the whole time we spent\r\nat these elevations. The clouds were rare, and always light and high,\r\nexcept a little fleecy spot of vapour condensed close to the summit of\r\nParas-nath. Though the nights were clear and starlight, no dew was\r\ndeposited, owing to the great dryness of the air. On one occasion, this\r\ndrought was so great during the passage of a hot wind, that at night I\r\nobserved the wet-bulb thermometer to stand 20·5 degrees below the\r\ntemperature of the air, which was 66° this indicated a dew-point of\r\n11·5°, or 54·5° below the air, and a saturation-point of 0·146; there\r\nbeing only 0·102 grains of vapour per cubic foot of air, which latter\r\nwas loaded with dust. The little moisture suspended in the atmosphere\r\nis often seen to be condensed in a thin belt of vapour, at a\r\nconsiderable distance above the dry surface of the earth, thus\r\nintercepting the radiation of heat from the latter to the clear sky\r\nabove. Such strata may be observed, crossing the hills in ribbonlike\r\nmasses, though not so clearly on this elevated region as on the plains\r\nbounding the lower course of the Soane, where the vapour is more dense,\r\nthe hills more scattered, and the whole atmosphere more humid. During\r\nthe ten days I spent amongst the hills I saw but one cloudy sunrise,\r\nwhereas below, whether at Calcutta, or on the banks of the Soane, the\r\nsun always rose behind a dense fog-bank.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 a.m. the black-bulb thermometer rose in the sun to 130°. The\r\nmorning observation before 10 or 11 a.m. always gives a higher result\r\nthan at noon, though the sun’s declination is so considerably less, and\r\nin the hottest part of the day it is lower still (3.30 p.m. 109°), an\r\neffect no doubt due to the vapours raised by the sun, and which equally\r\ninterfere with the photometer observations. The N.W. winds invariably\r\nrise at about 9 a.m. and blow with increasing strength till sunset;\r\nthey are due to the rarefaction of the air over the heated ground, and\r\nbeing loaded with dust, the temperature of the atmosphere is hence\r\nraised by the heated particles. The increased temperature of the\r\nafternoon is therefore not so much due to the accumulation of caloric\r\nfrom the sun’s rays, as to the passage of a heated current of air\r\nderived from the much hotter regions to the westward. It would be\r\ninteresting to know how far this N.W. diurnal tide extends; also the\r\nrate at which it gathers moisture in its progress over the damp regions\r\nof the Sunderbunds. Its excessive dryness in N.W. India approaches that\r\nof the African and Australian deserts; and I shall give an abstract of\r\nmy own observations, both in the valleys of the Soane and Ganges, and\r\non the elevated plateaus of Behar and of Mirzapore.[12]\r\n\r\n [12] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of February we proceeded to Tofe-Choney, the hills\r\nincreasing in height to nearly 1000 feet, and the country becoming more\r\npicturesque. We passed some tanks covered with _Villarsia_, and\r\nfrequented by flocks of white egrets. The existence of artificial tanks\r\nso near a lofty mountain, from whose sides innumerable water-courses\r\ndescend, indicates the great natural dryness of the country during one\r\nseason of the year. The hills and valleys were richer than I expected,\r\nthough far from luxuriant. A fine _Nauclea_ is a common shady tree, and\r\n_Bignonia indica_, now leafless, but with immense pods hanging from the\r\nbranches. _Acanthaceæ_ is the prevalent natural order, consisting of\r\ngay-flowered _Eranthemums, Ruellias, Barlerias,_ and such hothouse\r\nfavourites.[13]\r\n\r\n [13] Other plants gathered here, and very typical of the Flora of this\r\n dry region, were _Linum trigynum, Feronia elephantum, Ægle marmelos,\r\n Helicteres Asoca, Abrus precatorius, Flemingia_; various _Desmodia,\r\n Rhynchosiæ, Glycine,_ and _Grislea tomentosa_ very abundant,\r\n _Conocarpus latifoliusa, Loranthus longiflorus,_ and another species;\r\n _Phyllanthus Emblica,_ various _Convolvuli, Cuscuta,_ and several\r\n herbaceous _Compositæ._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis being the most convenient station whence to ascend Paras-nath, we\r\nstarted at 6 a.m. for the village of Maddaobund, at the north base of\r\nthe mountain, or opposite side from that on which the grand trunk-road\r\nruns. After following the latter for a few miles to the west, we took a\r\npath through beautifully wooded plains, with scattered trees of the\r\nMahowa (_Bassia latifolia_), resembling good oaks: the natives distil a\r\nkind of arrack from its fleshy flowers, which are also eaten raw. The\r\nseeds, too, yield a concrete oil, by expression, which is used for\r\nlamps and occasionally for frying.\r\n\r\nSome villages at the west base of the mountain occupy a better soil,\r\nand are surrounded with richer cultivation; palms, mangos, and the\r\ntamarind, the first and last rare features in this part of Bengal,\r\nappeared to be common, with fields of rice and broad acres of flax and\r\nrape, through the latter of which the blue _Orobanche indica_ swarmed.\r\nThe short route to Maddaobund, through narrow rocky valleys, was\r\nimpracticable for the elephants, and we had to make a very considerable\r\ndetour, only reaching that village at 2 p.m. All the hill people we\r\nobserved were a fine-looking athletic race; they disclaimed the tiger\r\nbeing a neighbour, which every palkee-bearer along the road declares to\r\ncarry off the torch-bearers, torch and all. Bears they said were\r\nscarce, and all other wild animals, but a natural jealousy of Europeans\r\noften leads the natives to deny the existence of what they know to be\r\nan attraction to the proverbially sporting Englishman.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old tamarind trees]\r\n\r\nThe site of Maddaobund, elevated 1,230 feet, in a clearance of the\r\nforest, and the appearance of the snow-white domes and bannerets of its\r\ntemples through the fine trees by which it is surrounded, are very\r\nbeautiful. Though several hundred feet above any point we had hitherto\r\nreached, the situation is so sheltered that the tamarind, peepul, and\r\nbanyan trees are superb. A fine specimen of the latter stands at the\r\nentrance to the village, not a broadheaded tree, as is usual in the\r\nprime of its existence, but a mass of trunks irregularly throwing out\r\nimmense branches in a most picturesque manner; the original trunk is\r\napparently gone, and the principal mass of root stems is fenced in.\r\nThis, with two magnificent tamarinds, forms a grand clump. The ascent\r\nof the mountain is immediately from the village up a pathway worn by\r\nthe feet of many a pilgrim from the most remote parts of India.\r\n\r\nParas-nath is a mountain of peculiar sanctity, to which circumstance is\r\nto be attributed the flourishing state of Maddaobund. The name is that\r\nof the twenty-third incarnation of Jinna (Sanscrit “Conqueror”), who\r\nwas born at Benares, lived one hundred years, and was buried on this\r\nmountain, which is the eastern metropolis of Jain worship, as Mount\r\nAboo is the western (where are their libraries and most splendid\r\ntemples). The origin of the Jain sect is obscure, though its rise\r\nappears to correspond with the wreck of Boodhism throughout India in\r\nthe eleventh century. The Jains form in some sort a transition-sect\r\nbetween Boodhists and Hindoos, differing from the former in\r\nacknowledging castes, and from both in their worship of Paras-nath’s\r\nfoot, instead of that of Munja-gosha of the Boodhs, or Vishnoo’s of the\r\nHindoos. As a sect of Boodhists their religion is considered pure, and\r\nfree from the obscenities so conspicuous in Hindoo worship; whilst, in\r\nfact, perhaps the reverse is the case; but the symbols are fewer, and\r\nindeed almost confined to the feet of Paras-nath, and the priests\r\njealously conceal their esoteric doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe temples, though small, are well built, and carefully kept. No\r\npersuasion could induce the Brahmins to allow us to proceed beyond the\r\nvestibule without taking off our shoes, to which we were not inclined\r\nto consent. The bazaar was for so small a village large, and crowded to\r\nexcess with natives of all castes, colours, and provinces of India,\r\nvery many from the extreme W. and N.W., Rajpootana, the Madras\r\nPresidency, and Central India. Numbers had come in good cars, well\r\nattended, and appeared men of wealth and consequence; while the\r\nquantities of conveyances of all sorts standing about, rather reminded\r\nme of an election, than of anything I had seen in India.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the place were a more Negro-looking race than the\r\nBengalees to whom I had previously been accustomed; and the curiosity\r\nand astonishment they displayed at seeing (probably many of them for\r\nthe first time) a party of Englishmen, were sufficiently amusing. Our\r\ncoolies with provisions not having come up, and it being two o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon, I having had no breakfast, and being ignorant of the\r\nexclusively Jain population of the village, sent my servant to the\r\nbazaar, for some fowls and eggs; but he was mobbed for asking for these\r\narticles, and parched rice, beaten flat, with some coarse sugar, was\r\nall I could obtain; together with sweetmeats so odiously flavoured with\r\nvarious herbs, and sullied with such impurities, that we quickly made\r\nthem over to the elephants.\r\n\r\nNot being able to ascend the mountain and return in one day, Mr.\r\nWilliams and his party went back to the road, leaving Mr. Haddon and\r\nmyself, who took up our quarters under a tamarind-tree.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a very gaudy poojah was performed. The car, filled with\r\nidols, was covered with gilding and silk, and drawn by noble bulls,\r\nfestooned and garlanded. A procession was formed in front; and it\r\nopened into an avenue, up and down which gaily dressed dancing-boys\r\npaced or danced, shaking castanets, the attendant worshippers singing\r\nin discordant voices, beating tom-toms, cymbals, etc. Images (of Boodh\r\napparently) abounded on the car, in front of which a child was placed.\r\nThe throng of natives was very great and perfectly orderly, indeed,\r\nsufficiently apathetic: they were remarkably civil in explaining what\r\nthey understood of their own worship. At 2 p.m., the thermometer was\r\nonly 65°, though the day was fine, a strong haze obstructing the sun’s\r\nrays; at 6 p.m., 58°; at 9 p.m., 56°, and the grass cooled to 49°.\r\nStill there was no dew, though the night was starlight.\r\n\r\nHaving provided doolies, or little bamboo chairs slung on four men’s\r\nshoulders, in which I put my papers and boxes, we next morning\r\ncommenced the ascent; at first through woods of the common trees, with\r\nlarge clumps of bamboo, over slaty rocks of gneiss, much inclined and\r\nsloping away from the mountain. The view from a ridge 500 feet high was\r\nsuperb, of the village, and its white domes half buried in the forest\r\nbelow, the latter of which continued in sight for many miles to the\r\nnorthward. Descending to a valley some ferns were met with, and a more\r\nluxuriant vegetation, especially of _Urticeæ._ Wild bananas formed a\r\nbeautiful, and to me novel feature in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe conical hills of the white ants were very abundant. The structure\r\nappears to me not an independent one, but the debris of clumps of\r\nbamboos, or of the trunks of large trees, which these insects have\r\ndestroyed. As they work up a tree from the ground, they coat the bark\r\nwith particles of sand glued together, carrying up this artificial\r\nsheath or covered way as they ascend. A clump of bamboos is thus\r\nspeedily killed; when the dead stems fall away, leaving the mass of\r\nstumps coated with sand, which the action of the weather soon fashions\r\ninto a cone of earthy matter.\r\n\r\nAscending again, the path strikes up the hill, through a thick forest\r\nof Sal (_Vateria robusta_) and other trees, spanned with cables of\r\nscandent _Bauhinia_ stems. At about 3000 feet above the sea, the\r\nvegetation becomes more luxuriant, and by a little stream I collected\r\nfive species of ferns and some mosses,—all in a dry state, however.\r\nStill higher, _Clematis, Thalictrum,_ and an increased number of\r\ngrasses are seen; with bushes of _Verbenaceæ_ and _Compositæ._ The\r\nwhite ant apparently does not enter this cooler region. At 3,500 feet\r\nthe vegetation again changes, the trees all become gnarled and\r\nscattered; and as the dampness also increases, more mosses and ferns\r\nappear. We emerged from the forest at the foot of the great ridge of\r\nrocky peaks, stretching E. and W. three or four miles. Abundance of a\r\nspecies of berberry and an _Osbeckia_ marked the change in the\r\nvegetation most decidedly, and were frequent over the whole summit,\r\nwith coarse grasses, and various bushes.\r\n\r\nAt noon we reached the saddle of the crest (alt. 4,230 feet), where was\r\na small temple, one of five or six which occupy various prominences of\r\nthe ridge. The wind, N.W., was cold, the temp. 56°. The view was\r\nbeautiful, but the atmosphere too hazy: to the north were ranges of low\r\nwooded hills, and the course of the Barakah and Adji rivers; to the\r\nsouth lay a flatter country, with lower ranges, and the Damooda river,\r\nits all but waterless bed snowy-white from the exposed granite blocks\r\nwith which its course is strewn. East and west the several sharp ridges\r\nof the mountain itself are seen; the western considerably the highest.\r\nImmediately below, the mountain flanks appear clothed with impenetrable\r\nforest, here and there interrupted by rocky eminences; while to the\r\nnorth the grand trunk road shoots across the plains, like a white\r\nthread, as straight as an arrow, spanning here and there the beds of\r\nthe mountain torrents.\r\n\r\nOn the south side the vegetation was more luxuriant than on the north,\r\nthough, from the heat of the sun, the reverse might have been expected.\r\nThis is owing partly to the curve taken by the ridge being open to the\r\nsouth, and partly to the winds from that quarter being the moist ones.\r\nAccordingly, trees which I had left 3000 feet below in the north\r\nascent, here ascended to near the summit, such as figs and bananas. A\r\nshort-stemmed palm (_Phœnix_) was tolerably abundant, and a small tree\r\n(_Pterospermum_) on which a species of grass grew epiphytically;\r\nforming a curious feature in the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the principal temple is very fine, below the saddle in\r\na hollow facing the south, surrounded by jungles of plantain and\r\nbanyan. It is small, and contains little worthy of notice but the\r\nsculptured feet of Paras-nath, and some marble Boodh idols;\r\ncross-legged figures with crisp hair and the Brahminical cord. These, a\r\nleper covered with ashes in the vestibule, and an officiating priest,\r\nwere all we saw. Pilgrims were seen on various parts of the mountain in\r\nvery considerable numbers, passing from one temple to another, and\r\ngenerally leaving a few grains of dry rice at each; the rich and lame\r\nwere carried in chairs, the poorer walked.\r\n\r\nThe culminant rocks are very dry, but in the rains may possess many\r\ncurious plants; a fine _Kalanchoe_ was common, with the berberry, a\r\nbeautiful _Indigofera,_ and various other shrubs; a _Bolbophyllum_ grew\r\non the rocks, with a small _Begonia,_ and some ferns. There were no\r\nbirds, and very few insects, a beautiful small _Pontia_ being the only\r\nbutterfly. The striped squirrel was very busy amongst the rocks; and I\r\nsaw a few mice, and the traces of bears.\r\n\r\nAt 3 p.m., the temperature was 54°, and the air deliciously cool and\r\npleasant. I tried to reach the western peak (perhaps 300 feet above the\r\nsaddle), by keeping along the ridge, but was cut off by precipices, and\r\nere I could retrace my steps it was time to descend. This I was glad to\r\ndo in a doolie, and I was carried to the bottom, with only one short\r\nrest, in an hour and three quarters. The descent was very steep the\r\nwhole way, partly down steps of sharp rock, where one of the men cut\r\nhis foot severely. The pathway at the bottom was lined for nearly a\r\nquarter of a mile with sick, halt, maimed, lame, and blind beggars,\r\nawaiting our descent. It was truly a fearful sight, especially the\r\nlepers, and numerous unhappy victims to elephantiasis.\r\n\r\nThough the botany of Paras-nath proved interesting, its elevation was\r\nnot accompanied by such a change from the flora of its base as I had\r\nexpected. This is no doubt due to its dry climate and sterile soil;\r\ncharacters which it shares with the extensive elevated area of which it\r\nforms a part, and upon which I could not detect above 300 species of\r\nplants during my journey. Yet, that the atmosphere at the summit is\r\nmore damp as well as cooler than at the base, is proved as well by the\r\nobservations as by the vegetation;[14] and in some respects, as the\r\nincreased proportion of ferns, additional epiphytal orchideous plants,\r\n_Begonias,_ and other species showed, its top supported a more tropical\r\nflora than its base.\r\n\r\n [14] Of plants eminently typical of a moister atmosphere, I may\r\n mention the genera _Bolbophyllum, Begonia, Æginetia, Disporum,\r\n Roxburghia, Panax, Eugenia, Myrsine, Shorea, Millettia,_ ferns,\r\n mosses, and foliaceous lichens; which appeared in strange association\r\n with such dry-climate genera as _Kalanchoe, Pterospermum,_ and the\r\n dwarf-palm, _Phœnix._ Add to this list the _Berberis asiatica,\r\n Clematis nutans, Thalictrum glyphocarpum,_ 27 grasses, _Cardamine,_\r\n etc., and the mountain top presents a mixture of the plants of a damp\r\n hot, a dry hot, and of a temperate climate, in fairly balanced\r\n proportions. The prime elements of a tropical flora were however\r\n wholly wanting on Paras-nath, where are neither Peppers, _Pothos,\r\n Arum,_ tall or climbing palms, tree-ferns, _Guttiferæ,_ vines, or\r\n laurels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nDoomree—Vegetation of table-land—Lieutenant Beadle—Birds—Hot springs of\r\nSoorujkoond—Plants near them—Shells in\r\nthem—Cholera-tree—Olibanum—Palms, form of—Dunwah Pass—Trees, native and\r\nplanted—Wild peacock—Poppy fields—Geography and geology of Behar and\r\nCentral India—Toddy-palm—Ground, temperature of—Barroon—Temperature of\r\nplants—Lizard—Cross the Soane—Sand, ripple marks on—Kymore\r\nhills—Ground, temperature of—Limestone—Rotas fort and palace—Nitrate of\r\nlime—Change of climate—Lime stalagmites, enclosing leaves—Fall of\r\nSoane—Spiders, etc.—Scenery and natural history of upper Soane\r\nvalley—_Hardwickia binata_—Bhel\r\nfruit—Dust-storm—Alligator—Catechu—_Cochlospermum_\r\n—Leaf-bellows—Scorpions—Tortoises—Florican—Limestone\r\nspheres—Coles—Tiger-hunt—Robbery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening we returned to our tamarind tree, and the next morning\r\nregained the trunk road, following it to the dawk bungalow of Doomree.\r\nOn the way I found the _Cæsalpinia paniculuta,_ a magnificent climber,\r\nfestooning the trues with its dark glossy foliage and gorgeous racemes\r\nof orange blossoms. Receding from the mountain, the country again\r\nbecame barren: at Doomree the hills were of crystalline rocks, chiefly\r\nquartz and gneiss; no palms or large trees of any kind appeared. The\r\nspear-grass abounded, and a detestable nuisance it was, its long awns\r\nand husked seed working through trowsers and stockings.\r\n\r\n_Balanites_ was not uncommon, forming a low thorny bush, with _Ægle\r\nmarmelos_ and _Feronia elephantum._ Having rested the tired elephant,\r\nwe pushed on in the evening to the next stage, Baghoda, arriving there\r\nat 3 a.m., and after a few hours’ rest, I walked to the bungalow of\r\nLieutenant Beadle, the surveyor of roads, sixteen miles further.\r\n\r\nThe country around Baghoda is still very barren, but improves\r\nconsiderably in going westward, the ground becoming hilly, and the road\r\nwinding through prettily wooded valleys, and rising gradually to 1,446\r\nfeet. _Nauclea cordifolia,_ a tree resembling a young sycamore, is very\r\ncommon; with the Semul (_Bombax_), a very striking tree from its\r\nbuttressed trunk and gaudy scarlet flowers, swarming with birds, which\r\nfeed from its honeyed blossoms.\r\n\r\nAt 10 a.m. the sun became uncomfortably hot, the thermometer being 77°,\r\nand the black-bulb thermometer 137°. I had lost my hat, and possessed\r\nno substitute but a silken nightcap; so I had to tie a handkerchief\r\nover my head, to the astonishment of the passers-by. Holding my head\r\ndown, I had little source of amusement but reading the foot-marks on\r\nthe road; and these were strangely diversified to an English eye. Those\r\nof the elephant, camel, buffalo and bullock, horse, ass, pony, dog,\r\ngoat, sheep and kid, lizard, wild-cat and pigeon, with men, women, and\r\nchildren’s feet, naked and shod, were all recognisable.\r\n\r\nIt was noon ere I arrived at Lieutenant Beadle’s, at Belcuppee (alt.\r\n1,219 feet), glad enough of the hearty welcome I received, being very\r\nhot, dusty, and hungry. The country about his bungalow is very pretty,\r\nfrom the number of wooded hills and large trees, especially of banyan\r\nand peepul, noble oak-like Mahowa (_Bassia_), _Nauclea,_ Mango, and\r\n_Ficus infectoria._ These are all scattered, however, and do not form\r\nforest, such as in a stunted form clothes the hills, consisting of\r\n_Diospyros, Terminalia, Gmelina, Nauclea parvifolia, Buchanania,_ etc.\r\nThe rocks are still hornblende-schist and granite, with a covering of\r\nalluvium, full of quartz pebbles. Insects and birds are numerous, the\r\nlatter consisting of jays, crows, doves, sparrows, and maina\r\n(_Pastor_); also the _Phœnicophaus tristis_ (“Mahoka” of the natives),\r\nwith a note like that of the English cuckoo, as heard late in the\r\nseason. I remained two days with Lieutenant Beadle, enjoying in his\r\nsociety several excursions to the hot springs, etc. These springs\r\n(called Soorujkoond) are situated close to the road, near the mouth of\r\na valley, in a remarkably pretty spot. They are, of course, objects of\r\nworship; and a ruined temple stands close behind them, with three very\r\nconspicuous trees—a peepul, a banyan, and a white, thick-stemmed,\r\nleafless _Sterculia,_ whose branches bore dense clusters of greenish\r\nfœtid flowers. The hot springs are four in number, and rise in as many\r\nruined brick tanks about two yards across. Another tank, fed by a cold\r\nspring, about twice that size, flows between two of the hot, only two\r\nor three paces distant from one of the latter on either hand. All burst\r\nthrough the gneiss rocks, meet in one stream after a few yards, and are\r\nconducted by bricked canals to a pool of cold water, about eighty yards\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures of the hot springs were respectively 169°, 170°, 173°,\r\nand 190°; of the cold, 84° at 4 p.m., and 75° at 7 a.m. the following\r\nmorning. The hottest is the middle of the five. The water of the cold\r\nspring is sweet but not good, and emits gaseous bubbles; it was covered\r\nwith a green floating _Conferva._ Of the four hot springs, the most\r\ncopious is about three feet deep, bubbles constantly, boils eggs, and\r\nthough brilliantly clear, has an exceedingly nauseous taste. This and\r\nthe other warm ones cover the bricks and surrounding rocks with a thick\r\nincrustation of salts.\r\n\r\n_Confervæ_ abound in the warm stream from the springs, and two species,\r\none ochreous brown, and the other green, occur on the margins of the\r\ntanks themselves, and in the hottest water; the brown is the best\r\nSalamander, and forms a belt in deeper water than the green; both\r\nappear in broad luxuriant strata, wherever the temp. is cooled down to\r\n168°, and as low as 90°. Of flowering plants, three showed in an\r\neminent degree a constitution capable of resisting the heat, if not a\r\npredilection for it; these were all _Cyperaceæ,_ a _Cyperus_ and an\r\n_Eleocharis,_ having their roots in water of 100°, and where they are\r\nprobably exposed to greater heat, and a _Fimbristylis_ at 98°; all were\r\nvery luxuriant. From the edges of the four hot springs I gathered\r\nsixteen species of flowering plants, and from the cold tank five, which\r\ndid not grow in the hot. A water-beetle, _Colymbetes_(?) and\r\n_Notonecta,_ abounded in water at 112°, with quantities of dead shells;\r\nfrogs were very lively, with live shells, at 90°, and with various\r\nother water beetles. Having no means of detecting the salts of this\r\nwater, I bottled some for future analysis.[15]\r\n\r\n [15] For an account of the _Confervæ,_ and of the mineral constituents\r\n of the waters, etc. see Appendix B.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day I botanized in the neighbourhood, with but poor\r\nsuccess. An oblique-leaved fig climbs the other trees, and generally\r\nstrangles them: two epiphytal _Orchideæ_ also occur on the latter,\r\n_Vanda Roxburghii_ and an _Oberonia._ Dodders (_Cuscuta_) of two\r\nspecies, and _Cassytha,_ swarm over and conceal the bushes with their\r\nyellow thread-like stems.\r\n\r\nI left Belcuppee on the 8th of February, following Mr. Williams’ camp.\r\nThe morning was clear and cold, the temperature only 56°. We crossed\r\nthe nearly dry broad bed of the Burkutta river, a noble stream during\r\nthe rains, carrying along huge boulders of granite and gneiss. Near\r\nthis I passed the Cholera-tree, a famous peepul by the road side, so\r\ncalled from a detachment of infantry having been attacked and decimated\r\nat the spot by that fell disease; it is covered with inscriptions and\r\nvotive tokens in the shape of rags, etc. We continued to ascend to\r\n1,360 feet, where I came upon a small forest of the Indian Olibanum\r\n(_Boswellia thurifera_), conspicuous from its pale bark, and spreading\r\ncurved branches, leafy at their tips; its general appearance is a good\r\ndeal like that of the mountain ash. The gum, celebrated throughout the\r\nEast, was flowing abundantly from the trunk, very fragrant and\r\ntransparent. The ground was dry, sterile, and rocky; kunker, the\r\ncurious formation mentioned at p. 12, appears in the alluvium, which I\r\nhad not elsewhere seen at this elevation.\r\n\r\nDescending to the village of Burshoot, we lost sight of the\r\n_Boswellia,_ and came upon a magnificent tope of mango, banyan, and\r\npeepul, so far superior to anything hitherto met with, that we were\r\nglad to choose such a pleasant halting-place for breakfast. There are a\r\nfew lofty fan-palms here too, great rarities in this soil and\r\nelevation: one, about eighty feet high, towered above some wretched\r\nhovels, displaying the curious proportions of this tribe of palms:\r\nfirst, a short cone, tapering to one-third the height of the stem, the\r\ntrunk then swelling to two-thirds, and again tapering to the crown.\r\nBeyond this, the country again ascends to Burree (alt. 1,169 feet),\r\nanother dawk bungalow, a barren place, which we left on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nSo little was there to observe, that I again amused myself by watching\r\nfootsteps, the precision of which in the sandy soil was curious.\r\nLooking down from the elephant, I was interested by seeing them all in\r\n_relief,_ instead of _depressed,_ the slanting rays of the sun in front\r\nproducing this kind of mirage. Before us rose no more of those wooded\r\nhills that had been our companions for the last 120 miles, the absence\r\nof which was a sign of the nearly approaching termination of the great\r\nhilly plateau we had been traversing for that distance.\r\n\r\nChorparun, at the top of the Dunwah pass, is situated on an extended\r\nbarren flat, 1,320 feet above the sea, and from it the descent from the\r\ntable-land to the level of the Soane valley, a little above that of the\r\nGanges at Patna, is very sudden. The road is carried zizgag down a\r\nrugged hill of gneiss, with a descent of nearly 1000 feet in six miles,\r\nof which 600 are exceedingly steep. The pass is well wooded, with\r\nabundance of bamboo, _Bombax, Cassia, Acacia,_ and _Butea,_ with\r\n_Calotropis,_ the purple Mudar, a very handsome road-side plant, which\r\nI had not seen before, but which, with the _Argemone Mexicana,_ was to\r\nbe a companion for hundreds of miles farther. All the views in the pass\r\nare very picturesque, though wanting in good foliage, such as _Ficus_\r\nwould afford, of which I did not see one tree. Indeed the rarity of the\r\ngenus (except _F. infectoria_) in the native woods of these hills, is\r\nvery remarkable. The banyan and peepul always appear to be planted, as\r\ndo the tamarind and mango.\r\n\r\nDunwah, at the foot of the pass, is 620 feet above the sea, and nearly\r\n1000 below the mean level of the highland I had been traversing. Every\r\nthing bears here a better aspect; the woods at the foot of the hills\r\nafforded many plants; the bamboo (_B. stricta_) is green instead of\r\nyellow and white; a little castor-oil is cultivated, and the Indian\r\ndate (low and stunted) appears about the cottages.\r\n\r\nIn the woods I heard and saw the wild peacock for the first time. Its\r\nvoice is not to be distinguished from that of the tame bird in England,\r\na curious instance of the perpetuation of character under widely\r\ndifferent circumstances, for the crow of the wild jungle-fowl does not\r\nrival that of the farm-yard cock.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we left Dunwah for Barah (alt. 480 feet), passing over\r\nvery barren soil, covered with low jungle, the original woods having\r\napparently been cut for fuel. Our elephant, a timid animal, came on a\r\ndrove of camels in the dark by the road-side, and in his alarm insisted\r\non doing battle, tearing through the thorny jungle, regardless of the\r\nmahout, and still more of me: the uproar raised by the camel-drivers\r\nwas ridiculous, and the danger to my barometer imminent.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded on the 11th of February to Sheergotty, where Mr. Williams\r\nand his camp were awaiting our arrival. Wherever cultivation appeared\r\nthe crops were tolerably luxuriant, but a great deal of the country\r\nyielded scarcely half-a-dozen kinds of plants to any ten square yards\r\nof ground. The most prevalent were _Carissa carandas, Olax scandens,_\r\ntwo _Zizyphi,_ and the ever-present _Acacia Catechu._ The climate is,\r\nhowever, warmer and much moister, for I here observed dew to be formed,\r\nwhich I afterwards found to be usual on the low grounds. That its\r\npresence is due to the increased amount of vapour in the atmosphere I\r\nshall prove: the amount of radiation, as shown by the cooling of the\r\nearth and vegetation, being the same in the elevated plain and lower\r\nlevels.[16]\r\n\r\n [16] See Appendix C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good soil was very richly cultivated with poppy (which I had not\r\nseen before), sugar-cane, wheat, barley, mustard, rape, and flax. At a\r\ndistance a field of poppies looks like a green lake, studded with white\r\nwater-lilies. The houses, too, are better, and have tiled roofs; while,\r\nin such situations, the road is lined with trees.\r\n\r\nA retrospect of the ground passed over is unsatisfactory, as far as\r\nbotany is concerned, except as showing how potent are the effects of a\r\ndry soil and climate during one season of the year upon a vegetation\r\nwhich has no desert types. During the rains probably many more species\r\nwould be obtained, for of annuals I scarcely found twenty. At that\r\nseason, however, the jungles of Behar and Birbhoom, though far from\r\ntropically luxuriant, are singularly unhealthy.\r\n\r\nIn a geographical point of view the range of hills between Burdwan and\r\nthe Soave is interesting, as being the north-east continuation of a\r\nchain which crosses the broadest part of the peninsula of India, from\r\nthe Gulf of Cambay to the junction of the Ganges and Hoogly at\r\nRajmahal. This range runs south of the Soane and Kymore, which it meets\r\nI believe at Omerkuntuk;[17] the granite of this and the sandstone of\r\nthe other, being there both overlaid with trap. Further west again, the\r\nranges separate, the southern still betraying a nucleus of granite,\r\nforming the Satpur range, which divides the valley of the Taptee from\r\nthat of the Nerbudda. The Paras-nath range is, though the most\r\ndifficult of definition, the longer of the two parallel ranges; the\r\nVindhya continued as the Kymore, terminating abruptly at the Fort of\r\nChunar on the Ganges. The general and geological features of the two,\r\nespecially along their eastern course, are very different. This\r\nconsists of metamorphic gneiss, in various highly inclined beds,\r\nthrough which granite hills protrude, the loftiest of which is\r\nParas-nath. The north-east Vindhya (called Kymore), on the other hand,\r\nconsists of nearly horizontal beds of sandstone, overlying inclined\r\nbeds of non-fossiliferous limestone. Between the latter and the\r\nParas-nath gneiss, come (in order of superposition) shivered and\r\nundulating strata of metamorphic quartz, hornstone, hornstone-porphyry,\r\njaspers, etc. These are thrown up, by greenstone I believe, along the\r\nnorth and north-west boundary of the gneiss range, and are to be\r\nrecognised as forming the rocks of Colgong, of Sultangunj, and of\r\nMonghyr, on the Ganges, as also various detached hills near Gyah, and\r\nalong the upper course of the Soane. From these are derived the\r\nbeautiful agates and cornelians, so famous under the name of Soane\r\npebbles, and they are equally common on the Curruckpore range, as on\r\nthe south bank of the Soane, so much so in the former position as to\r\nhave been used in the decoration of the walls of the now ruined palaces\r\nnear Bhagulpore.\r\n\r\n [17] A lofty mountain said to be 7000-8000 feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the route I had taken, I had crossed the eastern extremity alone of\r\nthe range, commencing with a very gradual ascent, over the alluvial\r\nplains of the west bank of the Hoogly, then over laterite, succeeded by\r\nsandstone of the Indian coal era, which is succeeded by the granite\r\ntable-land, properly so called. A little beyond the coal fields, the\r\ntable-land reaches an average height of 1,130 feet, which is continued\r\nfor upwards of 100 miles, to the Dunwah pass. Here the descent is\r\nsudden to plains, which, continuous with those of the Ganges, run up\r\nthe Soane till beyond Rotasghur. Except for the occasional ridges of\r\nmetamorphic rocks mentioned above, and some hills of intruded\r\ngreenstone, the lower plain is stoneless, its subjacent rocks being\r\ncovered with a thicker stratum of the same alluvium which is thinly\r\nspread over the higher table-land above. This range is of great\r\ninterest from its being the source of many important rivers,[18] and of\r\nall those which water the country between the Soane, Hoogly, and\r\nGanges, as well as from its deflecting the course of the latter river,\r\nwhich washes its base at Rajmahal, and forcing it to take a sinuous\r\ncourse to the sea. In its climate and botany it differs equally from\r\nthe Gangetic plains to the north, and from the hot, damp, and exuberant\r\nforests of Orissa to the south. Nor are its geological features less\r\ndifferent, or its concomitant and in part resultant characters of\r\nagriculture and native population. Still further west, the great rivers\r\nof the peninsula have their origin, the Nerbudda and Taptee flowing\r\nwest to the gulf of Cambay, the Cane to the Jumna, the Soane to the\r\nGanges, and the northern feeders of the Godavery to the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\n [18] The chief rivers from this, the great watershed of western\r\n Bengal, flow north-west and south-east; a few comparatively\r\n insignificant streams running north to the Ganges. Amongst the former\r\n are the Rheru, the Kunner, and the Coyle, which contribute to the\r\n Soane; amongst the latter, the Dammooda, Adji, and Barakah, flow into\r\n the Hoogly, and the Subunrika, Braminee, and Mahanuddee into the Bay\r\n of Bengal.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of February, we left Sheergotty (alt. 463 feet), crossing\r\nsome small streams, which, like all else seen since leaving the Dunwah\r\nPass, flow N. to the Ganges. Between Sheergotty and the Soane, occur\r\nmany of the isolated hills of greenstone, mentioned above, better known\r\nto the traveller from having been telegraphic stations. Some are much\r\nimpregnated with iron, and whether for their colour, the curious\r\noutlines of many, or their position, form quaint, and in some cases\r\npicturesque features in the otherwise tame landscape.\r\n\r\nThe road being highly cultivated, and the Date-palm becoming more\r\nabundant, we encamped in a grove of these trees. All were curiously\r\ndistorted; the trunks growing zigzag, from the practice of yearly\r\ntapping the alternate sides for toddy. The incision is just below the\r\ncrown, and slopes upwards and inwards: a vessel is hung below the\r\nwound, and the juice conducted into it by a little piece of bamboo.\r\nThis operation spoils the fruit, which, though eaten, is small, and\r\nmuch inferior to the African date.\r\n\r\nAt Mudunpore (alt. 440 feet) a thermometer, sunk 3 feet 4 inches in the\r\nsoil, maintained a constant temperature of 71·5°, that of the air\r\nvarying from 77·5°, at 3 p.m., to 62 at daylight the following morning;\r\nwhen we moved on to Nourunga (alt. 340 feet), where I bored to 3 feet 8\r\ninches with a heavy iron jumper through an alluvium of such excessive\r\ntenacity, that eight natives were employed for four hours in the\r\noperation. In both this and another hole, 4 feet 8 inches, the\r\ntemperature was 72° at 10 p.m.; and on the following morning 71·5° in\r\nthe deepest hole, and 70° in the shallower: that of the external air\r\nvaried from 71° at 3 p.m., to 57° at daylight on the following morning.\r\nAt the latter time I took the temperature of the earth near the\r\nsurface, which showed,\r\n\r\nSurface 53° 1 inch 57° 2 inches 58° 4 inches 62° 7\r\ninches 64°\r\n\r\nThe following day we marched to Baroon (alt. 345 feet) on the alluvial\r\nbanks of the Soane, crossing a deep stream by a pretty suspension\r\nbridge, of which the piers were visible two miles off, so level is the\r\nroad. The Soane is here three miles wide, its nearly dry bed being a\r\ndesert of sand, resembling a vast arm of the sea when the tide is out:\r\nthe banks are very barren, with no trees near, and but very few in the\r\ndistance. The houses were scarcely visible on the opposite side, behind\r\nwhich the Kymore mountains rise. The Soane is a classical river, being\r\nnow satisfactorily identified with the Eranoboas of the ancients.[19]\r\n\r\n [19] The etymology of Eranoboas is undoubtedly _Hierrinia Vahu_\r\n (Sanskrit), the golden-armed. Sons is also the Sanskrit for _gold._\r\n The stream is celebrated for its agates (Soane pebbles), which are\r\n common, but gold is not now obtained from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alluvium is here cut into a cliff, ten or twelve feet above the bed\r\nof the river, and against it the sand is blown in naked _dunes._ At 2\r\np.m., the surface-sand was heated to 110° where sheltered from the\r\nwind, and 104° in the open bed of the river. To compare the rapidity\r\nand depth to which the heat is communicated by pure sand, and by the\r\ntough alluvium, I took the temperature at some inches depth in both.\r\nThat the alluvium absorbs the heat better, and retains it longer, would\r\nappear from the following, the only observations I could make, owing to\r\nthe tenacity of the soil.\r\n\r\n2 p.m. Surface 104° 2·5 inches 93° 5 inches 88° Sand at\r\nthis depth 78° 5 a.m. Surface 51° 28 inches 68·5°\r\n\r\nFinding the fresh milky juice of _Calotropis_ to be only 72°, I was\r\ncurious to ascertain at what depth this temperature was to be obtained\r\nin the sand of the river-bed, where the plant grew.\r\n\r\nSurface 104·5° 1 inch 102° 2 inches 94° 2·5 inches 90° 3·5\r\ninches 85° (Compact) 8 inches 73° (Wet) 15\r\ninches 72° (Wet)\r\n\r\nThe power this plant exercises of maintaining a low temperature of 72°,\r\nthough the main portion which is subterraneous is surrounded by a soil\r\nheated to between 90° and 104°, is very remarkable, and no doubt\r\nproximately due to the rapidity of evaporation from the foliage, and\r\nconsequent activity in the circulation. Its exposed leaves maintained a\r\ntemperature of 80°, nearly 25° cooler than the similarly exposed sand\r\nand alluvium. On the same night the leaves were cooled down to 54°,\r\nwhen the sand had cooled to 51°. Before daylight the following morning\r\nthe sand had cooled to 43°, and the leaves of the _Calotropis_ to\r\n45·5°. I omitted to observe the temperature of the sap at the latter\r\ntime; but the sand at the same depth (15 inches) as that at which its\r\ntemperature and that of the plant agreed at mid-day, was 68°. And\r\nassuming this to be the heat of the plant, we find that the leaves are\r\nheated by solar radiation during the day 8°, and cooled by nocturnal\r\nradiation, 22·5°.\r\n\r\nMr. Theobald (my companion in this and many other rambles) pulled a\r\nlizard from a hole in the bank. Its throat was mottled with scales of\r\nbrown and yellow. Three ticks had fastened on it, each of a size\r\ncovering three or four scales: the first was yellow, corresponding with\r\nthe yellow colour of the animal’s belly, where it lodged, the second\r\nbrown, from the lizard’s head; but the third, which was clinging to the\r\nparti-coloured scales of the neck, had its body parti-coloured, the\r\nhues corresponding with the individual scales which they covered. The\r\nadaptation of the two first specimens in colour to the parts to which\r\nthey adhered, is sufficiently remarkable; but the third case was most\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 14th of February, I observed a beautiful\r\ndisplay, apparently of the Aurora borealis, an account of which will be\r\nfound in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n_February 15._—Our passage through the Soane sands was very tedious,\r\nthough accomplished in excellent style, the elephants pushing forward\r\nthe heavy waggons of mining tools with their foreheads. The wheels were\r\nsometimes buried to the axles in sand, and the draught bullocks were\r\nrather in the way than otherwise. The body of water over which we\r\nferried, was not above 80 yards wide. In the rains, when the whole\r\nspace of three miles is one rapid flood, 10 or 12 feet deep, charged\r\nwith yellow sand, this river must present an imposing spectacle. I\r\nwalked across the dry portion, observing the sand-waves, all ranged in\r\none direction, perpendicular to that of the prevailing wind, accurately\r\nrepresenting the undulations of the ocean, as seen from a mast-head or\r\nhigh cliff. As the sand was finer or coarser, so did the surface\r\nresemble a gentle ripple, or an ocean-swell. The progressive motion of\r\nthe waves was curious, and caused by the lighter particles being blown\r\nover the ridges, and filling up the hollows to leeward. There were a\r\nfew islets in the sand, a kind of oases of mud and clay, in laminæ no\r\nthicker than paper, and these were at once denizened by various weeds.\r\nSome large spots were green with wheat and barley-crops, both suffering\r\nfrom smut. We encamped close to the western shore, at the village of\r\nDearee (alt. 330 feet); it marks the termination of the Kymore Hills,\r\nalong whose S.E. bases our course now lay, as we here quitted the grand\r\ntrunk road for a rarely visited country. On the 16th we marched south\r\nup the river to Tilotho (alt. 395 feet), through a rich and highly\r\ncultivated country, covered with indigo, cotton, sugar-cane, safflower,\r\ncastor-oil, poppy, and various grains. Dodders (_Cuscuta_) covered even\r\ntall trees with a golden web, and the _Capparis acuminata_ was in full\r\nflower along the road side. Tilotho, a beautiful village, is situated\r\nin a superb grove of Mango, Banyan, Peepul, Tamarind, and _Bassia._ The\r\nDate or toddy-palm and fan-palm are very abundant and tall: each had a\r\npot hung under the crown. The natives climb these trunks with a hoop or\r\ncord round the body and both ancles, and a bottle-gourd or other vessel\r\nhanging round the neck to receive the juice from the stock-bottle, in\r\nthis aerial wine-cellar. These palms were so lofty that the climbers,\r\nas they paused in their ascent to gaze with wonder at our large\r\nretinue, resembled monkeys rather than men. Both trees yield a toddy,\r\nbut in this district they stated that that from the _Phœnix_ (Date)\r\nalone ferments, and is distilled; while in other parts of India, the\r\n_Borassus_ (fan-palm) is chiefly employed. I walked to the hills, over\r\na level cultivated country interspersed with occasional belts of low\r\nwood; in which the pensile nests of the weaver-bird were abundant, but\r\ngenerally hanging out of reach, in prickly _Acacias._\r\n\r\nThe hills here present a straight precipitous wall of horizontally\r\nstratified sandstone, very like the rocks at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwith occasionally a shallow valley, and a slope of débris at the base,\r\ndensely clothed with dry jungle. The cliffs are about 1000 feet high,\r\nand the plants similar to those at the foot of Paras-nath, but stunted:\r\nI climbed to the top, the latter part by steps or ledges of sandstone.\r\nThe summit was clothed with long grass, trees of _Diospyros_ and\r\n_Terminalia,_ and here and there the _Boswellia._ On the precipitous\r\nrocks the curious white-barked _Sterculia fœtida_ “flung its arms\r\nabroad,” leafless, and looking as if blasted by lightning.\r\n\r\nA hole was sunk here again for the thermometers, and, as usual, with\r\ngreat labour; the temperatures obtained were—\r\n\r\nAir. 4 feet 6 inches,\r\nunder good shade\r\nof trees 9 p.m. 64·5° 77° 11 p.m.  76° 5.30\r\na.m. 58·5° 76°\r\n\r\nThis is a very great rise (of 4°) above any of those previously\r\nobtained, and certainly indicates a much higher mean temperature of the\r\nlocality. I can only suppose it due to the radiation of heat from the\r\nlong range of sandstone cliff, exposed to the south, which overlooks\r\nthe flat whereon we were encamped, and which, though four or five miles\r\noff, forms a very important feature. The differences of temperature in\r\nthe shade taken on this and the other side of the river are 2·75°\r\nhigher on this side.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th we marched to Akbarpore (alt. 400 feet), a village overhung\r\nby the rocky precipice of Rotasghur, a spur of the Kymore, standing\r\nabruptly forward.\r\n\r\nThe range, in proceeding up the Soane valley, gradually approaches the\r\nriver, and beds of non-fossiliferous limestone are seen protruding\r\nbelow the sandstone and occasionally rising into rounded hills, the\r\npaths upon which appear as white as do those through the chalk\r\ndistricts of England. The overlying beds of sandstone are nearly\r\nhorizontal, or with a dip to the N.W.; the subjacent ones of limestone\r\ndip at a greater angle. Passing between the river and a detached\r\nconical hill of limestone, capped with a flat mass of sandstone, the\r\nspur of Rotas broke suddenly on the view, and very grand it was, quite\r\nrealising my anticipations of the position of these eyrie-like\r\nhill-forts of India. To the left of the spur winds the valley of the\r\nSoane, with low-wooded hills on its opposite bank, and a higher range,\r\nconnected with that of Behar, in the distance. To the right, the hills\r\nsweep round, forming an immense and beautifully wooded amphitheatre,\r\nabout four miles deep, bounded with a continuation of the escarpment.\r\nAt the foot of the crowned spur is the village of Akbarpore, where we\r\nencamped in a Mango tope;[20] it occupies some pretty undulating\r\nlimestone hills, amongst which several streams flow from the\r\namphitheatre to the Soane. During our two days’ stay here, I had the\r\nadvantage of the society of Mr. C. E. Davis, who was our guide during\r\nsome rambles in the neighbourhood, and to whose experience, founded on\r\nthe best habits of observation, I am indebted for much information. At\r\nnoon we started to ascend to the palace, on the top of the spur. On the\r\nway we passed a beautiful well, sixty feet deep, and with a fine flight\r\nof steps to the bottom. Now neglected and overgrown with flowering\r\nweeds and creepers, it afforded me many of the plants I had only\r\npreviously obtained in a withered state; it was curious to observe\r\nthere some of the species of the hill-tops, whose seeds doubtless are\r\nscattered abundantly over the surrounding plains, and only vegetate\r\nwhere they find a coolness and moisture resembling that of the altitude\r\nthey elsewhere affect. A fine fig-tree growing out of the stone-work\r\nspread its leafy green branches over the well mouth, which was about\r\ntwelve feet square; its roots assumed a singular form, enveloping two\r\nsides of the walls with a beautiful net-work, which at _high-water\r\nmark_ (rainy season), abruptly divides into thousands of little\r\nbrushes, dipping into the water which they fringe. It was a pretty cool\r\nplace to descend to, from a temperature of 80° above, to 74° at the\r\nbottom, where the water was 60°; and most refreshing to look, either up\r\nthe shaft to the green fig shadowing the deep profound, or along the\r\nsloping steps through a vista of flowering herbs and climbing plants,\r\nto the blue heaven of a burning sky.\r\n\r\n [20] On the 24th of June, 1848, the Soane rose to an unprecedented\r\n height, and laid this grove of Mangos three feet under water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ascent to Rotas is over the dry hills of limestone, covered with a\r\nscrubby brushwood, to a crest where are the first rude and ruined\r\ndefences. The limestone is succeeded by the sandstone cliff cut into\r\nsteps, which led from ledge to ledge and gap to gap, well guarded with\r\nwalls and an archway of solid masonry. Through this we passed on to the\r\nflat summit of the Kymore hills, covered with grass and forest,\r\nintersected by paths in all directions. The ascent is about 1,200\r\nfeet—a long pull in the blazing sun of February. The turf consists\r\nchiefly of spear-grass and _Andropogon muricatus,_ the kus-kus, which\r\nyields a favourite fragrant oil, used as a medicine in India. The trees\r\nare of the kinds mentioned before. A pretty octagonal summer-house,\r\nwith its roof supported by pillars, occupies one of the highest points\r\nof the plateau, and commands a superb view of the scenery before\r\ndescribed. From this a walk of three miles leads through the woods to\r\nthe palace. The buildings are very extensive, and though now ruinous,\r\nbear evidence of great beauty in the architecture: light galleries,\r\nsupported by slender columns, long cool arcades, screened squares and\r\nterraced walks, are the principal features. The rooms open out upon\r\nflat roofs, commanding views of the long endless table-land to the\r\nwest, and a sheer precipice of 1000 feet on the other side, with the\r\nSoane, the amphitheatre of hills, and the village of Akbarpore below.\r\n\r\nThis and Beejaghur, higher up the Soane, were amongst the most recently\r\nreduced forts, and this was further the last of those wrested from\r\nBaber in 1542. Some of the rooms are still habitable, but the greater\r\npart are ruinous, and covered with climbers, both of wild flowers and\r\nof the naturalised garden plants of the adjoining shrubbery; the\r\n_Arbor-tristis,_ with _Hibiscus, Abutilon,_ etc., and above all, the\r\nlittle yellow-flowered _Linaria ramosissima,_ crawling over every\r\nruined wall, as we see the walls of our old English castles clothed\r\nwith its congener _L. Cymbalaria._\r\n\r\nIn the old dark stables I observed the soil to be covered with a\r\ncopious evanescent efflorescence of nitrate of lime, like soap-suds\r\nscattered about.\r\n\r\nI made Rotas Palace 1,490 feet above the sea, so that this table-land\r\nis here only fifty feet higher than that I had crossed on the grand\r\ntrunk road, before descending at the Dunwah pass. Its mean temperature\r\nis of course considerably (4°) below that of the valley, but though so\r\ncool, agues prevail after the rains. The extremes of temperature are\r\nless marked than in the valley, which becomes excessively heated, and\r\nwhere hot winds sometimes last for a week, blowing in furious gusts.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the whole neighbourhood has of late changed materially;\r\nand the fall of rain has much diminished, consequent on felling the\r\nforests; even within six years the hail-storms have been far less\r\nfrequent and violent. The air on the hills is highly electrical, owing,\r\nno doubt, to the dryness of the atmosphere, and to this the frequent\r\nrecurrence of hail-storms may be due.\r\n\r\nThe zoology of these regions is tolerably copious, but little is known\r\nof the natural history of a great part of the plateau; a native tribe,\r\nprone to human sacrifices, is talked of. Tigers are common, and bears\r\nare numerous; they have, besides, the leopard, panther, viverine cat,\r\nand civet; and of the dog tribe the pariah, jackal, fox, and wild dog,\r\ncalled Koa. Deer are very numerous, of six or seven kinds. A small\r\nalligator inhabits the hill streams, said to be a very different animal\r\nfrom either of the Soane species.\r\n\r\nDuring our descent we examined several instances of ripple-mark (fossil\r\nwaves’ footsteps) in the sandstone; they resembled the fluting of the\r\n_Sigillaria_ stems, in the coal-measures, and occurring as they did\r\nhere, in sandstone, a little above great beds of limestone, had been\r\ntaken for such, and as indications of coal.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we visited Rajghat, a steep ghat or pass leading\r\nup the cliff to Rotas Palace, a little higher up the river. We took the\r\nelephants to the mouth of the glen, where we dismounted, and whence we\r\nfollowed a stream abounding in small fish and aquatic insects\r\n(_Dytisci_ and _Gyrini_), through a close jungle, to the foot of the\r\ncliffs, where there are indications of coal. The woods were full of\r\nmonkeys, and amongst other plants I observed _Murraya exotica,_ but it\r\nwas scarce. Though the jungle was so dense, the woods were very dry,\r\ncontaining no Palm, _Adroideæ,_ Peppers, _Orchideæ_ or Ferns. Here, at\r\nthe foot of the red cliffs, which towered imposingly above, as seen\r\nthrough the tree tops, are several small seams of coaly matter in the\r\nsandstone, with abundance of pyrites, sulphur, and copious\r\nefflorescences of salts of iron; but no coal. The springs from the\r\ncliffs above are charged with lime, of which enormous tuff beds are\r\ndeposited on the sandstone, full of impressions of the leaves and stems\r\nof the surrounding trees, which, however, I found it very difficult to\r\nrecognize, and could not help contrasting this circumstance with the\r\nfact that geologists, unskilled in botany, see no difficulty in\r\nreferring equally imperfect remains of extinct vegetables to existing\r\ngenera. In some parts of their course the streams take up quantities of\r\nthe efflorescence, which they scatter over the sandstones in a singular\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAt Akbarpore I had sunk two thermometers, one 4 feet 6 inches, the\r\nother 5 feet 6 inches; both invariably indicated 76°, the air varying\r\nfrom 56° to 79·5°. Dew had formed every night since leaving Dunwah, the\r\ngrass being here cooled 12° below the air.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February we marched up the Soane to Tura, passing some\r\nlow hills of limestone, between the cliffs of the Kymore and the river.\r\nOn the shaded riverbanks grew abundance of English genera—_Cynoglossum,\r\nVeronica, Potentilla, Ranunculus sceleratus, Rumex,_ several herbaceous\r\n_Compositæ_ and _Labiatæ_; _Tamarix_ formed a small bush in rocky\r\nhillocks in the bed of the river, and in pools were several aquatic\r\nplants, _Zannichellia, Chara,_ a pretty little _Vallisneria,_ and\r\n_Potamogeton._ The Brahminee goose was common here, and we usually saw\r\nin the morning immense flocks of wild geese overhead, migrating\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nHere I tried again the effect of solar and nocturnal radiation on the\r\nsand, at different depths, not being able to do so on the alluvium.\r\n\r\nNoon,\r\nTemperature\r\nof air, 87°   Daylight of\r\nfollowing\r\nmorning Surface 110° 52° 1 inch 102° 55° 2\r\ninches 93·5° 58° 4 inches 84° 67° 8 inches 77° sand\r\nwet 73° wet 12 inches 76° sand wet 74°\r\n\r\nFrom Tura our little army again crossed the Soane, the scarped cliffs\r\nof the Kymore approaching close to the river on the west side. The bed\r\nis very sandy, and about one mile and a half across.\r\n\r\nThe elephants were employed again, as at Baroon, to push the cart: one\r\nof them had a bump in consequence, as large as a child’s head, just\r\nabove the trunk, and bleeding much; but the brave beast disregarded\r\nthis, when the word of command was given by his driver.\r\n\r\nThe stream was very narrow, but deep and rapid, obstructed with beds of\r\ncoarse agate, jasper, cornelian and chalcedony pebbles. A clumsy boat\r\ntook us across to the village of Soanepore, a wretched collection of\r\nhovels. The crops were thin and poor, and I saw no palms or good trees.\r\nSquirrels however abounded, and were busy laying up their stores;\r\ndescending from the trees they scoured across a road to a field of\r\ntares, mounted the hedge, took an observation, foraged and returned up\r\nthe tree with their booty, quickly descended, and repeated the\r\noperation of reconnoitering and plundering.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the river is here considerably above that at Dearee, where\r\nthe mean of the observations with those of Baroon, made it about 300\r\nfeet. The mean of those taken here and on the opposite side, at Tura,\r\ngives about 400 feet, indicating a fall of 100 feet in only 40 miles.\r\n\r\nNear this the sandy banks of the Soane were full of martins’ nests,\r\neach one containing a pair of eggs. The deserted ones were literally\r\ncrammed full of long-legged spiders (_Opilio_), which could be raked\r\nout with a stick, when they came pouring down the cliff like corn from\r\na sack; the quantities are quite inconceivable. I did not observe the\r\nmartin feed on them.\r\n\r\nThe entomology here resembled that of Europe, more than I had expected\r\nin a tropical country, where predaceous beetles, at least _Carabideæ_\r\nand _Staphylinideæ,_ are generally considered rare. The latter tribes\r\nswarmed under the clods, of many species but all small, and so\r\nsingularly active that I could not give the time to collect many. In\r\nthe banks again, the round egg-like earthy chrysalis of the _Sphynx\r\nAtropos_ (?) and the many-celled nidus of the leaf-cutter bee, were\r\nvery common.\r\n\r\nA large columnar _Euphorbia_ (_E. ligulata_) is common all along the\r\nSoane, and I observed it to be used everywhere for fencing. I had not\r\nremarked the _E. neriifolia_; and the _E. tereticaulis_ had been very\r\nrarely seen since leaving Calcutta. The _Cactus_ is nowhere found; it\r\nis abundant in many parts of Bengal, but certainly not indigenous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crossing the Soane, with the Kymore Hills in the\r\ndistance]\r\n\r\n  From this place onwards up the Soane, there was no road of any kind,\r\n  and we were compelled to be our own road engineers. The sameness of\r\n  the vegetation and lateness of the season made me regret this the\r\n  less, for I was disappointed in my anticipations of finding\r\n  luxuriance and novelty in these wilds. Before us the valley narrowed\r\n  considerably, the forest became denser, the country on the south side\r\n  was broken with rounded hills, and on the north the noble cliffs of\r\n  the Kymore dipped down to the river. The villages were smaller, more\r\n  scattered and poverty-stricken, with the Mahowa and Mango as the\r\n  usual trees; the banyan, peepul, and tamarind being rare. The native,\r\n  are of an aboriginal jungle race; and are tall, athletic, erect, much\r\n  less indolent and more spirited than the listless natives of the\r\n  plains.\r\n\r\n_February 21._—Started at daylight: but so slow and difficult was our\r\nprogress through fields and woods, and across deep gorges from the\r\nhills, that we only advanced five miles in the day; the elephant’s head\r\ntoo was aching too badly to let him push, and the cattle would not\r\nproceed when the draught was not equal. What was worse, it was\r\nimpossible to get them to pull together up the inclined planes we cut,\r\nexcept by placing a man at the head of each of the six, eight, or ten\r\nin a team, and simultaneously screwing round their tails; when one\r\ntortured animal sometimes capsizes the vehicle. The small carts got on\r\nbetter, though it was most nervous to see them rushing down the steeps,\r\nespecially those with our fragile instruments, etc.\r\n\r\nKosdera, where we halted, is a pretty place, elevated 440 feet, with a\r\nbroad stream front the hills flowing past it. These hills are of\r\nlimestone, and rounded, resting upon others of hornstone and jasper.\r\nFollowing up the stream I came to some rapids, where the stream is\r\ncrossed by large beds of hornstone and porphyry rocks, excessively\r\nhard, and pitched up at right angles, or with a bold dip to the north.\r\nThe number of strata was very great, and only a few inches or even\r\nlines thick: they presented all varieties of jasper, hornstone, and\r\nquartz of numerous colours, with occasional seams of porphyry or\r\nbreccia. The racks were elegantly fringed with a fern I had not\r\nhitherto seen, _Polypodium proliferum,_ which is the only species the\r\nSoane valley presents at this season.\r\n\r\nReturning over the hills, I found _Hardwickia binata,_ a most elegant\r\nleguminous tree, tall, erect, with an elongated coma, and the branches\r\npendulous. These trees grew in a shallow bed of alluvium, enclosing\r\nabundance of agate pebbles and kunker, the former derived from the\r\nquartzy strata above noticed.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd and 24th we continued to follow up the Soane, first to\r\nPanchadurma (alt. 490 feet), and thence to Pepura (alt. 587 feet), the\r\ncountry becoming densely wooded, very wild, and picturesque, the woods\r\nbeing full of monkeys, parrots, peacocks, hornbills, and wild animals.\r\n_Strychnos potatorum,_ whose berries are used to purify water, forms a\r\ndense foliaged tree, 30 to 60 feet high, some individuals pale yellow,\r\nothers deep green, both in apparent health. _Feronia Elephantum_ and\r\n_Ægle marmelos_[21] were very abundant, with _Sterculia,_ and the dwarf\r\ndate-palm.\r\n\r\n [21] The Bhel fruit, lately introduced into English medical practice,\r\n as an astringent of great effect, in cases of diarrhœa and dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my carts was here hopelessly broken down; advancing on the\r\nspokes instead of the tire of the wheels. By the banks of a deep gully\r\nhere the rocks are well exposed: they consist of soft clay shales\r\nresting on the limestone, which is nearly horizontal; and this again,\r\nunconformably on the quartz and hornstone rocks, which are confused,\r\nand tilted up at all angles.\r\n\r\nA spur of the Kymore, like that of Rotas, here projects to the bed of\r\nthe river, and was blazing at night with the beacon-like fires of the\r\nnatives, lighted to scare the tigers and bears from the spots where\r\nthey cut wood and bamboo; they afforded a splendid spectacle, the\r\nflames in some places leaping zig-zag from hill to hill in front of us,\r\nand looking as if a gigantic letter W were written in fire.\r\n\r\nThe night was bright and clear, with much lightning, the latter\r\nattracted to the spur, and darting down as it were to mingle its fire\r\nwith that of the forest; so many flashes appeared to strike on the\r\nflames, that it is probable the heated air in their neighbourhood\r\nattracted them. We were awakened between 3 and 4 a.m., by a violent\r\ndust-storm, which threatened to carry away the tents. Our position at\r\nthe mouth of the gulley formed by the opposite hills, no doubt\r\naccounted for it. The gusts were so furious that it was impossible to\r\nobserve the barometer, which I returned to its case on ascertaining\r\nthat any indications of a rise or fall in the column must have been\r\nquite trifling. The night had been oppressively hot, with many insects\r\nflying about; amongst which I noticed earwigs, a genus erroneously\r\nsupposed rarely to take to the wing in Britain.\r\n\r\nAt 8.30 a.m. it suddenly fell calm, and we proceeded to Chanchee (alt.\r\n500 feet), the native carts breaking down in their passage over the\r\nprojecting beds of flinty rocks, or as they burned down the inclined\r\nplanes we cut through the precipitous clay banks of the streams. Near\r\nChanchee we passed an alligator, just killed by two men, a foul beast,\r\nabout nine feet long, of the mugger kind. More absorbing than its\r\nnatural history was the circumstance of its having swallowed a child,\r\nthat was playing in the water as its mother was washing her utensils in\r\nthe river. The brute was hardly dead, much distended by the prey, and\r\nthe mother was standing beside it. A very touching group was this: the\r\nparent with her hands clasped in agony, unable to withdraw her eyes\r\nfrom the cursed reptile, which still clung to life with that tenacity\r\nfor which its tribe are so conspicuous; beside these the two athletes\r\nleaned on the bloody bamboo staffs, with which they had all but\r\ndespatched the animal.\r\n\r\nThis poor woman earned a scanty maintenance by making catechu:\r\ninhabiting a little cottage, and having no property but two cattle to\r\nbring wood from the hills, and a very few household chattels; and how\r\nfew of these they only know who have seen the meagre furniture of Danga\r\nhovels. Her husband cut the trees in the forest and dragged them to the\r\nhut, but at this time he was sick, and her only boy, her future stay,\r\nit was, whom the beast had devoured.\r\n\r\nThis province is famous for the quantity of catechu its dry forests\r\nyield. The plant (_Acacia_) is a little thorny tree, erect, and bearing\r\na rounded head of well remembered prickly branches. Its wood is yellow,\r\nwith a dark brick-red heart, most profitable in January and useless in\r\nJune (for yielding the extract).\r\n\r\nThe _Butea frondosa_ was abundantly in flower here, and a gorgeous\r\nsight. In mass the inflorescence resembles sheets of flame, and\r\nindividually the flowers are eminently beautiful, the bright orange-red\r\npetals contrasting brilliantly against the jet-black velvety calyx. The\r\nnest of the _Megachile_ (leaf-cutter bee) was in thousands in the\r\ncliffs, with Mayflies, Caddis-worms, spiders, and many predaceous\r\nbeetles. Lamellicorn beetles were very rare, even _Aphodius,_ and of\r\n_Cetoniæ_ I did not see one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soane Valley and Kymore Hills. <i>Cochlospermum\r\ngossypium</i> and <i>Butea frondosa</i> in flower.]\r\n\r\nWe marched on the 28th to Kota, at the junction of the river of that\r\nname with the Soane, over hills of flinty rock, which projected\r\neverywhere, to the utter ruin of the elephants’ feet, and then over\r\nundulating hills of limestone; on the latter I found trees of\r\n_Cochlospermum,_ whose curious thick branches spread out somewhat\r\nawkwardly, each tipped with a cluster of golden yellow flowers, as\r\nlarge as the palm of the hand, and very beautiful: it is a tropical\r\nGum-Cistus in the appearance and texture of the petals, and their frail\r\nnature. The bark abounds in a transparent gum, of which the white ants\r\nseem fond, for they had killed many trees. Of the leaves the curious\r\nrude leaf-bellows are made, with which the natives of these hills smelt\r\niron. Scorpions appeared very common here, of a small kind, 1.5 inch\r\nlong; several were captured, and one of our party was stung on the\r\nfinger; the smart was burning for an hour or two, and then ceased.\r\n\r\nAt Kota we were nearly opposite the cliffs at Beejaghur, where coal is\r\nreported to exist; and here we again crossed the Soane, and for the\r\nlast time. The ford is three miles up the river, and we marched to it\r\nthrough deep sand. The bed of the river is here 500 feet above the sea,\r\nand about three-quarters of a mile broad, the rapid stream being 50 or\r\n60 yards wide, and breast deep. The sand is firm and siliceous, with no\r\nmica; nodules of coal are said to be washed down thus far from the\r\ncoal-beds of Burdee, a good deal higher up, but we saw none.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs come close to the river on the opposite side, their bases\r\nclothed with woods which teemed with birds. The soil is richer, and\r\nindividual trees, especially of _Bombax, Terminalia_ and _Mahowa,_ very\r\nfine; one tree of the _Hardwickia,_ about 120 feet high, was as\r\nhandsome a monarch of the forest as I ever saw, and it is not often\r\nthat one sees trees in the tropics, which for a combination of beauty\r\nin outline, harmony of colour, and arrangement of branches and foliage,\r\nwould form so striking an addition to an English park.\r\n\r\nThere is a large break in the Kymore hills here, beyond the village of\r\nKunch, through which our route lay to Beejaghur, and the Ganges at\r\nMirzapore; the cliff’s leaving the river and trending to the north in a\r\ncontinuous escarpment flanked with low ranges of rounded hills, and\r\nterminating in an abrupt spur (Mungeesa Peak) whose summit was covered\r\nwith a ragged forest. At Kunch we saw four alligators sleeping in the\r\nriver, looking at a distance like logs of wood, all of the short-nosed\r\nor mugger kind, dreaded by man and beast; I saw none of the\r\nsharp-shouted (or garial), so common on the Ganges, where their long\r\nbills, with a garniture of teeth and prominent eyes peeping out of the\r\nwater, remind one of geological lectures and visions of _Ichthyosauri._\r\nTortoises were frequent in the river, basking on the rocks, and popping\r\ninto the water when approached.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March we left the Soane, and struck inland over a rough\r\nhilly country, covered with forest, fully 1000 feet below the top of\r\nthe Kymore table-land, which here recedes from the river and surrounds\r\nan undulating plain, some ten miles either way, facing the south. The\r\nroads, or rather pathways, were very bad, and quite impassable for the\r\ncarts without much engineering, cutting through forest, smoothing down\r\nthe banks of the watercourses to be crossed, and clearing away the\r\nrocks as we best might. We traversed the empty bed of a mountain\r\ntorrent, with perpendicular banks of alluvium 30 feet high, and thence\r\nplunged into a dense forest. Our course was directed towards Mungeesa\r\nPeak, the remarkable projecting spur, between which and a conical hill\r\nthe path led. Whether on the elephants or on foot, the thorny jujubes,\r\n_Acacias,_ etc. were most troublesome, and all our previous scratchings\r\nwere nothing to this. Peacocks and jungle-fowl were very frequent, the\r\nsquabbling of the former and the hooting of the monkeys constantly\r\ngrating on the ear. There were innumerable pigeons and a few Floricans\r\n(a kind of bustard—considered the best eating game-bird in India). From\r\nthe defile we emerged on an open flat, halting at Sulkun, a scattered\r\nvillage (alt. 684 feet), peopled by a bold-looking race (Coles)[22] who\r\nhabitually carry the spear and shield. We had here the pleasure of\r\nmeeting Mr. Felle, an English gentleman employed in the Revenue\r\ndepartment; this being one of the roads along which the natives\r\ntransport their salt, sugar, etc., from one province to another.\r\n\r\n [22] The Coles, like the Danghas of the Rajmahal and Behar hills, and\r\n the natives of the mountains of the peninsula, form one of the\r\n aboriginal tribes of British India, and are widely different people\r\n from either the Hindoos or Mussulmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I examined the conical hill, which, like that near\r\nRotas, is of stratified beds of limestone, capped with sandstone. A\r\nstream runs round its base, cutting through the alluvium to the\r\nsubjacent rock, which is exposed, and contains flattened spheres of\r\nlimestone. These spheres are from the size of a fist to a child’s head,\r\nor even much larger; they are excessively hard, and neither laminated\r\nnor formed of concentric layers. At the top of the hill the sandstone\r\ncap was perpendicular on all sides, and its dry top covered with small\r\ntrees, especially of _Cochlospermum._ A few larger trees of _Fici_\r\nclung to the edge of the rocks, and by forcing their roots into the\r\ninterstices detached enormous masses, affording good dens for bears and\r\nother wild animals. From the top, the view of rock, river, forest, and\r\nplain, was very fine, the eye ranging over a broad flat, girt by\r\nprecipitous hills;—West, the Kymore or Vindhya range rose again in\r\nrugged elevations; South, flowed the Soane, backed by ranges of wooded\r\nhills, smoking like volcanos with the fires of the natives;—below, lay\r\nthe bed of the stream we had left at the foot of the hills, cutting its\r\nway through the alluvium, and following a deep gorge to the Soane,\r\nwhich was there hidden by the rugged heights we had crossed, on which\r\nthe greater part of our camp might be seen still straggling\r\nonwards;—east, and close above us, the bold spur of Mungeesa shot up,\r\nterminating a continuous stretch of red precipices, clothed with forest\r\nalong their bases, and over their horizontal tops.\r\n\r\nFrom Sulkun the view of the famed fort and palace of Beejaghur is very\r\nsingular, planted on the summit of an isolated hill of sandstone, about\r\nten miles off. A large tree by the palace marks its site; for, at this\r\ndistance, the buildings are themselves undistinguishable.\r\n\r\nThere are many tigers on these hills; and as one was close by, and had\r\nkilled several cattle, Mr. Felle kindly offered us a chance of slaying\r\nhim. Bullocks are tethered out, over-night, in the places likely to be\r\nvisited by the brute; he kills one of them, and is from the spot\r\ntracked to his haunt by natives, who visit the stations early in the\r\nmorning, and report the whereabouts of his lair. The sportsman then\r\ngoes to the attack mounted on an elephant, or having a _roost_ fixed in\r\na tree, on the trail of the tiger, and he employs some hundred natives\r\nto drive the animal past the lurking-place.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, the locale of the tiger was doubtful; but it\r\nwas thought that by beating over several miles of country he (or at any\r\nrate, some other game) might be driven past a certain spot. Thither,\r\naccordingly, the natives were sent, who built machans (stages) in the\r\ntrees, high out of danger’s reach; Mr. Theobald and myself occupied one\r\nof these perches in a _Hardwickia_ tree, and Mr. Felle another, close\r\nby, both on the slope of a steep hill, surrounded by jungly valleys. We\r\nwere also well thatched in with leafy boughs, to prevent the wary beast\r\nfrom espying the ambush, and had a whole stand of shall arms ready for\r\nhis reception.\r\n\r\nWhen roosted aloft, and duly charged to keep profound silence (which I\r\nobeyed to the letter, by falling sound asleep), the word was passed to\r\nthe beaters, who surrounded our post on the plain-side, extending some\r\nmiles in line, and full two or three distant from us. They entered the\r\njungle, beating tom-toms, singing and shouting as they advanced, and\r\nconverging towards our position. In the noonday solitude of these vast\r\nforests, our situation was romantic enough: there was not a breath of\r\nwind, an insect or bird stirring; and the wild cries of the men, and\r\nthe hollow sound of the drums broke upon the ear from a great distance,\r\ngradually swelling and falling, as the natives ascended the heights or\r\ncrossed the valleys. After about an hour and a half, the beaters\r\nemerged from the jungle under our retreat; one by one, two by two, but\r\npreceded by no single living thing, either mouse, bird, deer, or bear,\r\nand much less tiger. The beaters received about a penny a-piece for the\r\nday’s work; a rich guerdon for these poor wretches, whom necessity\r\nsometimes drives to feed on rats and offal.\r\n\r\nWe were detained three days at Sulkun, from inability to get on with\r\nthe carts; and as the pass over the Kymore to the north (on the way to\r\nMirzapore) was to be still worse, I took advantage of Mr. Felle’s kind\r\noffer of camels and elephants to make the best of my way forward,\r\naccompanying that gentleman, _en route,_ to his residence at Shahgunj,\r\non the table-land.\r\n\r\nBoth the climate and natural history of this flat on which Sulkun\r\nstands, are similar to those of the banks of the Soane; the crops are\r\nwretched. At this season the dryness of the atmosphere is excessive:\r\nour nails cracked, and skins peeled, whilst all articles of wood,\r\ntortoiseshell, etc., broke on the slightest blow. The air, too, was\r\nalways highly electrical, and the dew-point was frequently 40° below\r\nthe temperature of the air.\r\n\r\nThe natives are far from honest: they robbed one of the tents placed\r\nbetween two others, wherein a light was burning. One gentleman in it\r\nwas awake, and on turning saw five men at his bedside, who escaped with\r\na bag of booty, in the shape of clothes, and a tempting strong\r\nbrass-bound box, containing private letters. The clothes they dropped\r\noutside, but the box of letters was carried off. There were about a\r\nhundred people asleep outside the tents, between whose many fires the\r\nrogues must have passed, eluding also the guard, who were, or ought to\r\nhave been, awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nEk-powa Ghat—Sandstones—Shahgunj—Table-land, elevation,\r\netc.—Gum-arabic—Mango—Fair—Aquatic plants—Rujubbund—Storm—False sunset\r\nand sunrise—Bind hills—Mirzapore—Manufactures, imports, etc.—Climate\r\nof—Thuggee—Chunar—Benares—Mosque—Observatory—Sar-nath—Ghazeepore—Rose-\r\ngardens—Manufactory of Attar—Lord Cornwallis’ tomb—Ganges, scenery and\r\nnatural history of—Pelicans—Vegetation—Insects—Dinapore—Patna—Opium\r\ngodowns and manufacture—Mudar, white and purple—Monghyr islets—Hot\r\nSprings of Setakoond—Alluvium of Ganges—Rocks of\r\nSultun-gunj—Bhaugulpore—Temples of Mt.

There the country becomes very rocky and wooded, and a stream is\r\ncrossed, which runs over a flat bed of limestone, cracked into the\r\nappearance of a tesselated pavement. For many miles there is no pass\r\nover the Kymore range, except this, significantly called “Ek-powa-Ghat”\r\n(one-foot Ghat). It is evidently a _fault,_ or shifting of the rocks,\r\nproducing so broken a cliff as to admit of a path winding over the\r\nshattered crags. On either side, the precipices are extremely steep, of\r\nhorizontally stratified rocks, continued in an unbroken line, and the\r\nviews across the plain and Soane valley, over which the sun was now\r\nsetting, were superb. At the summit we entered on a dead flat plain or\r\ntable-land, with no hills, except along the brim of the broad valley we\r\nhad left, where are some curious broad pyramids, formed of slabs of\r\nsandstone arranged in steps. By dark we reached the village of Roump\r\n(alt. 1,090 feet), beyond the top of the pass.\r\n\r\nOn the next day I proceeded on a small, fast, and wofully high-trotting\r\nelephant, to Shahgunj, where I enjoyed Mr. Felle’s hospitality for a\r\nfew days. The country here, though elevated, is, from the nature of the\r\nsoil and formation, much more fertile than what I had left. Water is\r\nabundant, both in tanks and wells, and rice-fields, broad and\r\nproductive, cover the ground; while groves of tamarinds and mangos, now\r\nloaded with blossoms, occur at every village.\r\n\r\nIt is very singular that the elevation of this table-land (1,100 feet\r\nat Shahgunj) should coincide with that of the granite range of Upper\r\nBengal, where crossed by the grand trunk road, though they have no\r\nfeature but the presence of alluvium in common. Scarce a hillock varies\r\nthe surface here, and the agricultural produce of the two is widely\r\ndifferent. Here the flat ledges of sandstone retain the moisture, and\r\ngive rise to none of those impetuous torrents which sweep it off the\r\ninclined beds of gneiss, or splintered quartz. Nor is there here any of\r\nthe effloresced salts so forbidding to vegetation where they occur.\r\nWherever the alluvium is deep on these hills, neither _Catechu,\r\nOlibanum, Butea, Terminalia, Diospyros,_ dwarf-palm, or any of those\r\nplants are to be met with, which abound wherever the rock is\r\nsuperficial, and irrespectively of its mineral characters.\r\n\r\nThe gum-arabic _Acacia_ is abundant here, though not seen below, and\r\nvery rare to the eastward of this meridian, for I saw but little of it\r\nin Behar. It is a plant partial to a dry climate, and rather prefers a\r\ngood soil. In its distribution it in some degree follows the range of\r\nthe camel, which is its constant companion over thousands of leagues.\r\nIn the valley of the Ganges I was told that neither the animal nor\r\nplant flourish east of the Soane, where I experienced a marked change\r\nin the humidity of the atmosphere on my passage down the Ganges. It was\r\na circumstance I was interested in, having first met with the camel at\r\nTeneriffe and the Cape Verd Islands, the westernmost limit of its\r\ndistribution; imported thither, however, as it now is into Australia,\r\nwhere, though there is no _Acacia Arabica,_ four hundred other species\r\nof the genus are known.\r\n\r\nThe mango, which is certainly _the_ fruit of India, (as the pine-apple\r\nis of the Eastern Islands, and the orange of the West,) was now\r\nblossoming, and a superb sight. The young leaves are purplish-green,\r\nand form a curious contrast to the deep lurid hue of the older foliage;\r\nespecially when the tree is (which often occurs) dimidiate, one half\r\nthe green, and the other the red shades of colours; when in full\r\nblossom, all forms a mass of yellow, diffusing a fragrance rather too\r\nstrong and peculiar to be pleasant.\r\n\r\nWe passed a village where a large fair was being held, and singularly\r\nfamiliar its arrangements were to my early associations. The women and\r\nchildren are the prime customers; for the latter whirl-you-go-rounds,\r\ntoys, and sweetmeats were destined; to tempt the former, little booths\r\nof gay ornaments, patches for the forehead, ear-rings of quaint shapes,\r\nbugles and beads. Here as at home, I remarked that the vendors of these\r\nsuperfluities occupy the approaches to this Vanity-Fair. As, throughout\r\nthe East, the trades are congregated into particular quarters of the\r\ncities, so here the itinerants grouped themselves into little bazaars\r\nfor each class of commodity. Whilst I was engaged in purchasing a few\r\narticles of native workmanship, my elephant made an attack on a\r\nsweetmeat stall, demolishing a magnificent erection of barley-sugar,\r\nbefore his proceedings could be put a stop to.\r\n\r\nMr. Felle’s bungalow (whose garden smiled with roses in this\r\nwilderness) was surrounded by a moat (fed by a spring), which was full\r\nof aquatic plants, _Nymphæa, Damasonium, Villarsia cristata,\r\nAponogeton,_ three species of _Potamogeton,_ two of _Naias, Chara_ and\r\n_Zannichellia_ (the two latter indifferently, and often together, used\r\nin the refinement of sugar). In a large tank hard by, wholly fed by\r\nrain water, I observed only the _Villarsia Indica,_ no _Aponogeton,\r\nNymphæa,_ or _Dammonium,_ nor did these occur in any of the other tanks\r\nI examined, which were otherwise well peopled with plants. This may not\r\nbe owing to the quality of the water so much as to its varying quantity\r\nin the tank.\r\n\r\nAll around here, as at Roump, is a dead flat, except towards the crest\r\nof the ghats which overhang the valley of the Soane, and there the\r\nsandstone rock rises by steps into low hills. During a ride to a\r\nnatural tank amongst these rocky elevations, I passed from the alluvium\r\nto the sandstone, and at once met with all the prevailing plants of the\r\ngranite, gneiss, limestone and hornstone rocks previously examined, and\r\nwhich I have enumerated too often to require recapitulation; a\r\nconvincing proof that the mechanical properties and not the chemical\r\nconstitution of the rocks regulate the distribution of these plants.\r\n\r\nRujubbund (the pleasant spot), is a small tarn, or more properly the\r\nexpanded bed of a stream, art having aided nature in its formation: it\r\nis edged by rocks and cliffs fringed with the usual trees of the\r\nneighbourhood; it is a wild and pretty spot, not unlike some\r\nbirch-bordered pool in the mountains of Wales or Scotland, sequestered\r\nand picturesque. It was dark before I got back, with heavy clouds and\r\nvivid lightning approaching from the south-west. The day had been very\r\nhot (3 p.m., 90°), and the evening the same; but the barometer did not\r\nforetell the coming tempest, which broke with fury at 7 p.m., blowing\r\nopen the doors, and accompanied with vivid lightning and heavy thunder,\r\nclose by and all round, though no rain fell.\r\n\r\nIn the clear dry mornings of these regions, a curious optical phenomena\r\nmay be observed, of a _sunrise_ in the _west,_ and _sunset_ in the\r\n_east._ In either case, bright and well-defined beams rise to the\r\nzenith, often crossing to the opposite horizon. It is a beautiful\r\nfeature in the firmament, and equally visible whether the horizon be\r\ncloudy or clear, the white beams being projected indifferently against\r\na dark vapour or the blue serene. The zodiacal light shines from an\r\nhour or two after sunset till midnight, with singular brightness,\r\nalmost equalling the milky way.\r\n\r\n_March 7._—Left Shahgunj for Mirzapore, following the road to Goorawal,\r\nover a dead alluvial flat without a feature to remark. Turning north\r\nfrom that village, the country undulates, exposing the rocky nucleus,\r\nand presenting the usual concomitant vegetation. Occasionally park-like\r\nviews occurred, which, where diversified by the rocky valleys, resemble\r\nmuch the noble scenery of the Forest of Dean on the borders of Wales;\r\nthe _Mahowa_ especially representing the oak, with its spreading and\r\noften gnarled branches. Many of the exposed slabs of sandstone are\r\nbeautifully waved on the surface with the _ripple-mark_ impression.\r\n\r\nAmowee, where I arrived at 9 p.m., is on an open grassy flat, about\r\nfifteen miles from the Ganges, which is seen from the neighbourhood,\r\nflowing among trees, with the white houses, domes, and temples of\r\nMirzapore scattered around, and high above which the dust-clouds were\r\ncoursing along the horizon.\r\n\r\nMr. Money, the magistrate of Mirzapore, kindly sent a mounted messenger\r\nto meet me here, who had vast trouble in getting bearers for my palkee.\r\nIn it I proceeded the next day to Mirzapore, descending a steep ghat of\r\nthe Bind hills by an excellent road, to the level plains of the Ganges.\r\nUnlike the Dunwah pass, this is wholly barren. At the foot the sun was\r\nintensely hot, the roads alternately rocky and dusty, the villages\r\nthronged with a widely different looking race from those of the hills,\r\nand the whole air of the outskirts, on a sultry afternoon, far from\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nMirzapore is a straggling town, said to contain 100,000 inhabitants. It\r\nflanks the river, and is built on an undulating alluvial bank, full of\r\nkunker, elevated 360 feet above the sea, and from 50 to 80 above the\r\npresent level of the river. The vicinity of the Ganges and its green\r\nbank, and the numbers of fine trees around, render it a pleasing,\r\nthough not a fine town. It presents the usual Asiatic contrast of\r\nsqualor and gaudiness; consisting of large squares and broad streets,\r\ninterspersed with acres of low huts and groves of trees. It is\r\ncelebrated for its manufactory of carpets, which are admirable in\r\nappearance, and, save in durability, equal to the English. Indigo seed\r\nfrom Bundelkund is also a most extensive article of commerce, the best\r\ncoming from the Doab. For cotton, lac, sugar, and saltpetre, it is one\r\nof the greatest marts in India. The articles of native manufacture are\r\nbrass washing and cooking utensils, and stone deities worked out of the\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nThere is little native vegetation, the country being covered with\r\ncultivation and extensive groves of mango, and occasionally of guava.\r\nEnglish vegetables are abundant and excellent, and the strawberries,\r\nwhich ripen in March, rival the European fruit in size, but hardly in\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days spent at Mirzapore with my kind friend, Mr. C.\r\nHamilton, I was surprised to find the temperature of the day cooler by\r\nnearly 4° than that of the hills above, or of the upper part of the\r\nSoane valley; while on the other hand the nights were decidedly warmer.\r\nThe dewpoint again was even lower in proportion, (7·5°) and the climate\r\nconsequently drier. The atmosphere was extremely dry and electrical,\r\nthe hair constantly crackling when combed. Further west, where the\r\nclimate becomes still drier, the electricity of the air is even\r\ngreater. Mr. Griffith mentions in his journal that in filling barometer\r\ntubes in Affghanistan, he constantly experienced a shock.\r\n\r\nHere I had the pleasure of meeting Lieutenant Ward, one of the\r\nsuppressors of Thuggee (_Thuggee,_ in Hindostan, signifies a deceiver;\r\nfraud, not open force, being employed). This gentleman kindly showed me\r\nthe approvers or king’s evidence of his establishment, belonging to\r\nthose three classes of human scourges, the Thug, Dakoit, and Poisoner.\r\nOf these the first was the Thug, a mild-looking man, who had been born\r\nand bred to the profession: he had committed many murders, saw no harm\r\nin them, and felt neither shame nor remorse. His organs of observation\r\nand destructiveness were large, and the cerebellum small. He explained\r\nto me how the gang waylay the unwary traveller, enter into conversation\r\nwith him, and have him suddenly seized, when the superior throws his\r\nown linen girdle round the victim’s neck and strangles him, pressing\r\nthe knuckles against the spine. Taking off his own, he passed it round\r\nmy arm, and showed me the turn as coolly as a sailor once taught me the\r\n_hangman’s knot._ The Thug is of any caste, and from any part of India.\r\nThe profession have particular stations, which they generally select\r\nfor murder, throwing the body of their victim into a well.\r\n\r\nThe Dakoit (_dakhee,_ a robber) belongs to a class who rob in gangs,\r\nbut never commit murder—arson and housebreaking also forming part of\r\ntheir profession. These are all high-class Rajpoots, originally from\r\nGuzerat; who, on being conquered, vowed vengeance on mankind. They\r\nspeak both Hindostanee and the otherwise extinct Guzerat language; this\r\nis guttural in the extreme, and very singular in sound. They are a very\r\nremarkable people, found throughout India, and called by various names;\r\ntheir women dress peculiarly, and are utterly devoid of modesty. The\r\nman I examined was a short, square, but far from powerful Nepalese,\r\nwith high arched eyebrows, and no organs of observation. These people\r\nare great cowards.\r\n\r\nThe Poisoners all belong to one caste, of Pasie, or dealers in toddy:\r\nthey go singly or in gangs, haunting the travellers’ resting-places,\r\nwhere they drop half a rupee weight of pounded or whole _Datura_ seeds\r\ninto his food, producing a twenty-hours’ intoxication, during which he\r\nis robbed, and left to recover or sink under the stupifying effects of\r\nthe narcotic. He told me that the _Datura_ seed is gathered without\r\nceremony, and at any time, place, or age of the plant. He was a dirty,\r\nill-conditioned looking fellow, with no bumps behind his ears, or\r\nprominence of eyebrow region, but a remarkable cerebellum.\r\n\r\nThough now all but extinct (except in Cuttack), through ten or fifteen\r\nyears of unceasing vigilance on the part of Government, and incredible\r\nactivity and acuteness in the officers employed, the Thugs were\r\nformerly a wonderfully numerous body, who abstained from their vocation\r\nsolely in the immediate neighbourhood of their own villages; which,\r\nhowever, were not exempt from the visits of other Thugs; so that, as\r\nMajor Sleeman says,—“The annually returning tide of murder swept\r\nunsparingly over the whole face of India, from the Sutlej to the\r\nsea-coast, and from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin. One narrow district\r\nalone was free, the Concan, beyond the ghats, whither they never\r\npenetrated.” In Bengal, river Thugs replace the travelling\r\npractitioner. Candeish and Rohilkund alone harboured no Thugs as\r\nresidents, but they were nevertheless haunted by the gangs.\r\n\r\nTheir origin is uncertain, but supposed to be very ancient, soon after\r\nthe Mahommedan conquest. They now claim a divine original, and are\r\nsupposed to have supernatural powers, and to be the emissaries of the\r\ndivinity, like the wolf, the tiger, and the bear. It is only lately\r\nthat they have swarmed so prodigiously,—seven original gangs having\r\nmigrated from Delhi to the Gangetic provinces about 200 years ago, and\r\nfrom these all the rest have sprung. Many belong to the most amiable,\r\nintelligent, and respectable classes of the lower and even middle\r\nranks: they love their profession, regard murder as sport, and are\r\nnever haunted with dreams, or troubled with pangs of conscience during\r\nhours of solitude, or in the last moments of life. The victim is an\r\nacceptable sacrifice to the goddess Davee, who by some classes is\r\nsupposed to eat the lifeless body, and thus save her votaries the\r\nnecessity of concealing it.\r\n\r\nThey are extremely superstitious, always consulting omens, such as the\r\ndirection in which a hare or jackall crosses the road; and even far\r\nmore trivial circumstances will determine the fate of a dozen of\r\npeople, and perhaps of an immense treasure. All worship the pickaxe,\r\nwhich is symbolical of their profession, and an oath sworn on it binds\r\ncloser than on the Koran. The consecration of this weapon is a most\r\nelaborate ceremony, and takes place only under certain trees. They rise\r\nthrough various grades: the lowest are scouts; the second, sextons; the\r\nthird are holders of the victims’ hands; the highest, stranglers.\r\n\r\nThough all agree in never practising cruelty, or robbing previous to\r\nmurder,—never allowing any but infants to escape (and these are trained\r\nto Thuggee), and never leaving a trace of such goods as may be\r\nidentified,—there are several variations in their mode of conducting\r\noperations; some tribes spare certain castes, others none: murder of\r\nwoman is against all rules; but the practice crept into certain gangs,\r\nand this it is which led to their discountenance by the goddess Davee,\r\nand the consequent downfall of the system. Davee, they say, allowed the\r\nBritish to punish them, because a certain gang had murdered the mothers\r\nto obtain their daughters to be sold to prostitution.\r\n\r\nMajor Sleeman has constructed a map demonstrating the number of\r\n“Bails,” or regular stations for committing murder, in the kingdom of\r\nOude alone, which is 170 miles long by 100 broad, and in which are 274,\r\nwhich are regarded by the Thug with as much satisfaction and interest\r\nas a game preserve is in England: nor are these “bails” less numerous\r\nin other parts of India. Of twenty assassins who were examined, one\r\nfrankly confessed to having been engaged in 931 murders, and the least\r\nguilty of the number to 24. Sometimes 150 persons collected into one\r\ngang, and their profits have often been immense, the murder of six\r\npersons on one occasion yielding 82,000 rupees; upwards of 8000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOf the various facilities for keeping up the system, the most prominent\r\nare, the practice amongst the natives of travelling before dawn, of\r\ntravellers mixing freely together, and taking their meals by the\r\nway-side instead of in villages; in the very Bails, in fact, to which\r\nthey are inveigled by the Thug in the shape of a fellow-traveller;\r\nmoney remittances are also usually made by disguised travellers, whose\r\ntreasure is exposed at the custom-houses, and, worst of all, the\r\nbankers will never own to the losses they sustain, which, as a\r\nvisitation of God, would, if avenged, lead, they think, to future, and\r\nperhaps heavier punishment. Had the Thugs destroyed Englishmen, they\r\nwould quickly have been put down; but the system being invariably\r\npractised on a class of people acknowledging the finger of the Deity in\r\nits execution, its glaring enormities were long in rousing the\r\nattention of the Indian Government.\r\n\r\nA few examples of the activity exercised by the suppressors may be\r\ninteresting. They act wholly through the information given by\r\napprovers, who are simply king’s evidences. Of 600 Thugs engaged in the\r\nmurder of 64 people, and the plunder of nearly 20,000 pounds, all\r\nexcept seventy were captured in ten years, though separated into six\r\ngangs, and their operations continued from 1,826 to 1830: the last\r\nparty was taken in 1836. And again, between the years 1826 and 1835,\r\n1,562 Thugs were seized, of whom 382 were hanged, and 909 transported;\r\nso that now it is but seldom these wretches are ever heard of.\r\n\r\nTo show the extent of their operations I shall quote an anecdote from\r\nSleeman’s Reports (to which I am indebted for most of the above\r\ninformation). He states that he was for three years in charge of a\r\ndistrict on the Nerbudda, and considered himself acquainted with every\r\ncircumstance that occurred in the neighbourhood; yet, during that time,\r\n100 people were murdered and buried within less than a quarter of a\r\nmile of his own residence!\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and fifty boats full of river Thugs, in crews of fifteen,\r\ninfested the Ganges between Benares and Calcutta, during five months of\r\nevery year, under pretence of conveying pilgrims. Travellers along the\r\nbanks were tracked, and offered a passage, which if refused in the\r\nfirst boat was probably accepted in some other. At a given signal the\r\ncrews rushed in, doubled up the decoyed victim, broke his back, and\r\nthrew him into the river, where floating corpses are too numerous to\r\nelicit even an exclamation.\r\n\r\nAt Mirzapore I engaged a boat to carry me down the river to Bhagulpore,\r\nwhence I was to proceed to the Sikkim-Himalaya. The sketch at p.88 will\r\ngive some idea of this vessel, which, though slow and very shabby, had\r\nthe advantage of being cooler and more commodious than the handsomer\r\ncraft. Its appearance was not unlike that of a floating haystack, or\r\nthatched cottage: its length was forty feet, and breadth fifteen, and\r\nit drew a foot and a half of water: the deck, on which a kind of house,\r\nneatly framed of matting, was erected, was but a little above the\r\nwater’s edge. My portion of this floating residence was lined with a\r\nkind of reed-work formed of long culms of _Saccharum._ The crew and\r\ncaptain consisted of six naked Hindoos, one of whom steered by the huge\r\nrudder, sitting on a bamboo-stage astern; the others pulled four oars\r\nin the very bows opposite my door, or tracked the boat along the\r\nriverbank.\r\n\r\nIn my room (for cabin I cannot call it) stood my palkee, fitted as a\r\nbed, with mosquito curtains; a chair and table. On one side were placed\r\nall my papers and plants, under arrangement to go home; on the other,\r\nmy provisions, rice, sugar, curry-powder, a preserved ham, and cheese,\r\netc. Around hung telescope, botanical box, dark lantern, barometer, and\r\nthermometer, etc., etc. Our position was often _ashore,_ and,\r\nHindoo-like, on the lee-shore, going bump, bump, bump, so that I could\r\nhardly write. I considered myself fortunate in having to take this slow\r\nconveyance down, it enabling me to write and arrange all day long.\r\n\r\nI left on the 15th of March, and in the afternoon of the same day\r\npassed Chunar.[23] This is a tabular mass of sandstone, projecting into\r\nthe river, and the eastern termination of the Kymore range. There is\r\nnot a rock between this and the Himalaya, and barely a stone all the\r\nway down the Ganges, till the granite and gneiss rocks of the Behar\r\nrange are again met with. The current of the Ganges is here very\r\nstrong, and its breadth much lessened: the river runs between high\r\nbanks of alluvium, containing much kunker. At Benares it expands into a\r\nbroad stream, with a current which during the rains is said to flow\r\neight miles an hour, when the waters rise 43 feet. The fall hence is\r\n300 feet to its junction with the Hooghly, viz., one foot to every\r\nmile. My observations made that from Mirzapore to Benares considerably\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n [23] The first station at which Henry Martyn laboured in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenares is the Athens of India. The variety of buildings along the bank\r\nis incredible. There are temples of every shape in all stages of\r\ncompletion and dilapidation, and at all angles of inclination; for the\r\nbanks give way so much that many of these edifices are fearfully out of\r\nthe perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe famed mosque, built by Aurungzebe on the site of a Hindoo temple,\r\nis remarkable for its two octagonal minarets, 232 feet above the\r\nGanges. The view from it over the town, especially of the European\r\nResident’s quarter, is fine; but the building itself is deficient in\r\nbeauty or ornament: it commands the muddy river with its thousands of\r\nboats, its waters peopled with swimmers and bathers, who spring in from\r\nthe many temples, water-terraces, and ghats on the city side: opposite\r\nis a great sandy plain. The town below looks a mass of poor, square,\r\nflat-roofed houses, of which 12,000 are brick, and 16,000 mud and\r\nthatch, through the crowd of which, and of small temples, the eye\r\nwanders in vain for some attractive feature or evidence of the wealth,\r\nthe devotion, the science, or the grandeur of a city celebrated\r\nthroughout the East for all these attributes. Green parrots and pigeons\r\npeople the air.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of an oriental town is always more or less\r\nruinous; and here the eye is fatigued with bricks and crumbling\r\nedifices, and the ear with prayer-bells. The bright meadows and green\r\ntrees which adorn the European Resident’s dwelling, some four miles\r\nback from the river, alone relieve the monotony of the scene. The\r\nstreets are so narrow that it is difficult to ride a horse through\r\nthem; and the houses are often six stories high, with galleries\r\ncrossing above from house to house. These tall, gaunt edifices\r\nsometimes give place to clumps of cottages, and a mass of dusty ruins,\r\nthe unsavoury retreats of vermin and filth, where the _Calotropis\r\narborea_ generally spreads its white branches and glaucous leaves—a\r\ndusty plant. Here, too, enormous spiders’ webs hang from the crumbling\r\nwalls, choked also with dust, and resembling curtains of coarse muslin,\r\nbeing often some yards across, and not arranged in radii and arcs, but\r\nspun like weaver’s woofs. Paintings, remarkable only for their hideous\r\nproportions and want of perspective, are daubed in vermilion, ochre,\r\nand indigo. The elephant, camel, and porpoise of the Ganges, dog,\r\nshepherd, peacock, and horse, are especially frequent, and so is a\r\nrunning pattern of a hand spread open, with a blood-red spot on the\r\npalm. A still less elegant but frequent object is the fuel, which is\r\ncomposed of the manure collected on the roads of the city, moulded into\r\nflat cakes, and stuck by the women on the walls to dry, retaining the\r\nsign-manual of the artist in the impressed form of her outspread hand.\r\nThe cognizance of the Rajah, two fish chained together, appears over\r\nthe gates of public buildings.\r\n\r\nThe hundreds of temples and shrines throughout the city are its most\r\nremarkable feature: sacred bulls, and lingams of all sizes, strewed\r\nwith flowers and grains of rice meet the eye at every turn; and the\r\ncity’s boast is the possession of one million idols, which, of one kind\r\nand another, I can well believe. The great Hindoo festival of the\r\n_Holi_ was now celebrating, and the city more than ordinarily crowded;\r\nthrowing red powder (lac and flour), with rose-water, is the great\r\ndiversion at a festival more childish by far than a carnival.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Reade (the Commissioner), I obtained\r\nadmission to the Bishishar-Kumardil, the “holiest of holies.” It was a\r\nsmall, low, stone building, daubed with red inside, and swarming with\r\nstone images of Brahminee bulls, and various disgusting emblems. A fat\r\nold Brahmin, naked to the waist, took me in, but allowed no followers;\r\nand what with my ignorance of his phraseology, the clang of bells and\r\ndin of voices, I gained but little information. Some fine bells from\r\nNepal were evidently the lion of the temple. I emerged, adorned with a\r\nchaplet of magnolia flowers, and with my hands full of _Calotropis_ and\r\n_Nyctanthes_ blossoms. It was a horrid place for noise, smell, and\r\nsights. Thence I went to a holy well, rendered sacred because Siva,\r\nwhen stepping from the Himalaya to Ceylon, accidentally let a medicine\r\nchest fall into it. The natives frequent it with little basins or\r\nbaskets of rice, sugar, etc., dropping in a little of each while they\r\nmutter prayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Equatorial Sun-dial]\r\n\r\nThe observatory at Benares, and those at Delhi, Matra on the Jumna, and\r\nOujein, were built by Jey-Sing, Rajah of Jayanagar, upwards of 200\r\nyears ago; his skill in mathematical science was so well known, that\r\nthe Emperor Mahommed Shah employed him to reform the calendar. Mr.\r\nHunter, in the “Asiatic Researches,” gives a translation of the\r\nlucubrations of this really enlightened man, as contained in the\r\nintroduction to his own almanac.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Equinoctiall Sun-dial]\r\n\r\nOf the more important instruments I took sketches; No. 1, is the\r\nNaree-wila, or Equatorial dial; No. 2, the Semrat-yunta, or Equinoctial\r\ndial; No. 3, an Equatorial, probably a Kranti-urit, or Azimuth\r\ncircle.[24] Jey-Sing’s genius and love of science seem, according to\r\nHunter, to have descended to some of his family, who died early in this\r\ncentury, when “Urania fled before the brazen-fronted Mars, and the best\r\nof the observatories, that of Oujein, was turned into an arsenal and\r\ncannon foundry.”\r\n\r\n [24] Hunter, in As Soc. Researches, 177 (Calcutta); Sir R. Barker in\r\n Phil. Trans., lxvii. 608 (1777); J. L. Williams, Phil. Trans.,\r\n lxxxiii. 45 (1793).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brass Azimuth circle]\r\n\r\nThe observatory is still the most interesting object in Benares, though\r\nit is now dirty and ruinous, and the great stone instruments are\r\nrapidly crumbling away. The building is square, with a central court\r\nand flat roof, round which the astrolabes, etc. are arranged. A half\r\nnaked Astronomer-Royal, with a large sore on his stomach, took me\r\nround—he was a pitiful object, and told me he was very hungry. The\r\nobservatory is nominally supported by the Rajah of Jeypore, who doles\r\nout a too scanty pittance to his scientific corps.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Mr. Reade drove me to the Sar-nath, a singular\r\nBoodhist temple, a cylindrical mass of brickwork, faced with stone, the\r\nscrolls on which were very beautiful, and as sharp as if freshly cut:\r\nit is surmounted by a tall dome, and is altogether about seventy or a\r\nhundred feet high. Of the Boodh figures only one remains, the others\r\nhaving been used by a recent magistrate of Benares in repairing a\r\nbridge over the Goomtee! From this place the Boodhist monuments, Hindoo\r\ntemple, Mussulman mosque, and English church, were all embraced in one\r\n_coup d’œil._ On our return, we drove past many enormous mounds of\r\nearth and brick-work, the vestiges of Old Benares, but whether once\r\ncontinued to the present city or not is unknown. Remains are abundant,\r\neighteen feet below the site of the present city.\r\n\r\nBenares is the Mecca of the Hindoos, and the number of pilgrims who\r\nvisit it is incalculable. Casi (its ancient name, signifying splendid),\r\nis alleged to be no part of this world, which rests on eternity,\r\nwhereas Benares is perched on a prong of Siva’s trident, and is hence\r\nbeyond the reach of earthquakes.[25] Originally built of gold, the sins\r\nof the inhabitants were punished by its transmutation into stone, and\r\nlatterly into mud and thatch: whoever enters it, and especially visits\r\nits principal idol (Siva fossilised) is secure of heaven.\r\n\r\n [25] Probably an allusion to the infrequency of these phenomena in\r\n this meridian; they being common both in Eastern Bengal, and in\r\n Western India beyond the Ganges.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th I left Benares for Ghazepore, a pretty town situated on the\r\nnorth bank of the river, celebrated for its manufacture of rose-water,\r\nthe tomb of Lord Cornwallis, and a site of the Company’s stud. The Rose\r\ngardens surround the town: they are fields, with low bushes of the\r\nplant grown in rows, red with blossoms in the morning, all of which\r\nare, however, plucked long before midday. The petals are put into clay\r\nstills, with twice their weight of water, and the produce exposed to\r\nthe fresh air, for a night, in open vessels. The unskimmed water\r\naffords the best, and it is often twice and even oftener distilled; but\r\nthe fluid deteriorates by too much distillation. The Attar is skimmed\r\nfrom the exposed pans, and sells at 10 pounds the rupee weight, to make\r\nwhich 20,000 flowers are required. It is frequently adulterated with\r\nsandal-wood oil.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis’ mausoleum is a handsome building, modelled by Flaxman\r\nafter the Sybil’s Temple. The allegorical designs of Hindoos and\r\nsorrowing soldiers with reversed arms, which decorate two sides of the\r\nenclosed tomb, though perhaps as good as can be, are under any\r\ntreatment unclassical and uncouth. The simple laurel and oak-leaf\r\nchaplets on the alternating faces are far more suitable and suggestive.\r\n_March 21._—I left Ghazepore and dropped down the Ganges; the general\r\nfeatures of which are soon described. A strong current four or five\r\nmiles broad, of muddy water, flows between a precipitous bank of\r\nalluvium or sand on one side, and a flat shelving one of sand or more\r\nrarely mud, on the other. Sand-banks are frequent in the river,\r\nespecially where the great affluents debouche; and there generally are\r\nformed vast expanses of sand, small “Saharas,” studded with stalking\r\npillars of sand, raised seventy or eighty feet high by gusts of wind,\r\nerect, stately, grave-looking columns, all shaft, with neither basement\r\nnor capital, the genii of the “Arabian Nights.” The river is always\r\ndotted with boats of all shapes, mine being perhaps of the most common\r\ndescription; the great square, Yankee-like steamers, towing their\r\naccommodation-boats (as the passengers’ floating hotels are called),\r\nare the rarest. Trees are few on the banks, except near villages, and\r\nthere is hardly a palm to be seen above Patna. Towns are unfrequent,\r\nsuch as there are being mere collections of huts, with the ghat and\r\nboats at the bottom of the bank; and at a respectful distance from the\r\nbazaar, stand the neat bungalows of the European residents, with their\r\nsmiling gardens, hedgings and fencings, and loitering servants at the\r\ndoor. A rotting charpoy (or bedstead) on the banks is a common sight,\r\nthe “_sola reliquia_” of some poor Hindoo, who departs this life by the\r\nside of the stream, to which his body is afterwards committed.\r\n\r\nShoals of small goggled-eyed fish are seen, that spring clear out of\r\nthe water; and are preyed upon by terns and other birds; a few insects\r\nskim the surface; turtle and porpoises tumble along, all forming a very\r\nbusy contrast to the lazy alligator, sunning his green and scaly back\r\nnear the shore, with his ichthyosaurian snout raised high above the\r\nwater. Birds are numerous, especially early and late in the day. Along\r\nthe silent shore the hungry Pariah dog may be seen tearing his meal\r\nfrom some stranded corpse, whilst the adjutant-bird, with his head sunk\r\non his body and one leg tucked up, patiently awaits his turn. At night\r\nthe beautiful Brahminee geese alight, one by one, and seek total\r\nsolitude; ever since having disturbed a god in his slumbers, these\r\nbirds are fated to pass the night in single blessedness. The gulls and\r\nterns, again, roost in flocks, as do the wild geese and pelicans,—the\r\nlatter, however, not till after making a hearty and very noisy supper.\r\nThese birds congregate by the sides of pools, and beat the water with\r\nviolence, so as to scare the fish, which thus become an easy prey; a\r\nfact which was, I believe, first indicated by Pallas, during his\r\nresidence on the banks of the Caspian Sea. Shells are scarce, and\r\nconsist of a few small bivalves; their comparative absence is probably\r\ndue to the paucity of limestone in the mountains whence the many\r\nfeeders flow. The sand is pure white and small-grained, with fragments\r\nof hornblende and mica, the latter varying in abundance as a feeder is\r\nnear or far away. Pink sand[26] of garnets is very common, and\r\ndeposited in layers interstratified with the white quartz sand.\r\nWorm-marks, ripple-marks, and the footsteps of alligators, birds and\r\nbeasts, abound in the wet sand. The vegetation of the banks consists of\r\nannuals which find no permanent resting-place. Along the sandy shores\r\nthe ever-present plants are mostly English, as Dock, a _Nasturtium,\r\nRanunculus sceleratus, Fumitory, Juncus bufonius,_, Common Vervain,\r\n_Gnaphalium luteo-album,_ and very frequently _Veronica Anagallise._ On\r\nthe alluvium grow the same, mixed with Tamarisk, _Acacia Arabica,_ and\r\na few other bushes.\r\n\r\n [26] I have seen the same garnet sand covering the bottom of the\r\n Himalayan torrents, where it is the produce of disintegrated gneiss,\r\n and whence it is transported to the Ganges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithered grass abounds; and wheat, dhal (_Cajanus_) and gram (_Cicer\r\narietinum_), _Carthamus,_ vetches, and rice are the staple products of\r\nthe country. Bushes are few, except the universally prevalent Adhatoda\r\nand _Calotropis._ Trees, also, are rare, and of stunted growth; Figs,\r\nthe _Artocarpus_ and some _Leguminosa_ prevail most. I saw but two\r\nkinds of palm, the fan-palm, and _Phœnix_: the latter is characteristic\r\nof the driest locality. Then, for the animal creation, men, women, and\r\nchildren abound, both on the banks, and plying up and down the Ganges.\r\nThe humped cow (of which the ox is used for draught) is common. Camels\r\nI occasionally observed, and more rarely the elephant; poneys, goats,\r\nand dogs muster strong. Porpoises and alligators infest the river, even\r\nabove Benares. Flies and mosquitos are terrible pests; and so are the\r\nodious flying-bugs,[27] which insinuate themselves between one’s skin\r\nand clothes, diffusing a dreadful odour, which is increased by any\r\nattempt to touch or remove them. In the evening it was impossible to\r\nkeep insects out of the boat, or to hinder their putting the lights\r\nout; and of these the most intolerable was the abovementioned\r\nflying-bug. Saucy crickets, too, swarm, and spring up at one’s face,\r\nwhilst mosquitos maintain a constant guerilla warfare, trying to the\r\npatience no less than to the nerves. Thick webs of the gossamer spider\r\nfloat across the river during the heat of the day, as coarse as fine\r\nthread, and being inhaled keep tickling the nose and lips.\r\n\r\n [27] Large Hemipterous insects, of the genus _Derecteryx._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, the morning commenced with a dust-storm, the horizon was\r\nabout 20 yards off, and ashy white with clouds of sand; the trees were\r\nscarcely visible, and everything in my boat was covered with a fine\r\ncoat of impalpable powder, collected from the boundless alluvial plains\r\nthrough which the Ganges flows. Trees were scarcely discernible, and so\r\ndry was the wind that drops of water vanished like magic. Neither\r\nferns, mosses, nor lichens grow along the banks of the Ganges, they\r\ncannot survive the transition from parching like this to the three\r\nmonths’ floods at midsummer, when the country is for miles under water.\r\n\r\n_March 23._—Passed the mouth of the Soane, a vast expanse of sand\r\ndotted with droves of camels; and soon after, the wide-spread spits of\r\nsand along the north bank announced the mouth of the Gogra, one of the\r\nvastest of the many Himalayan affluents of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of March I reached Dinapore, a large military station,\r\nsufficiently insalubrious, particularly for European troops, the\r\nbarracks being so misplaced that the inmates are suffocated: the\r\nbuildings run east and west instead of north and south, and therefore\r\nlose all the breeze in the hottest weather. From this place I sent the\r\nboat down to Patna, and proceeded thither by land to the house of Dr.\r\nIrvine, an old acquaintance and botanist, from whom I received a most\r\nkind welcome. On the road, Bengal forms of vegetation, to which I had\r\nbeen for three months a stranger, reappeared; likewise groves of fan\r\nand toddy palms, which are both very rare higher up the river; clumps\r\nof large bamboo, orange, _Acacia Sissoo, Melia, Guatteria lonjpgolia,\r\nSpondias manjpgera, Odina, Euphorbia pentagona, neriifolia_ and\r\n_trigona,_ were common road-side plants. In the gardens, Papaw,\r\n_Croton, Jatropha, Buddleia, Cookia,_ Loquat, Litchi, Longan, all kinds\r\nof the orange tribe, and the cocoa-nut, some from their presence, and\r\nmany from their profusion, indicated a decided change of climate, a\r\nreceding from the desert north-west of India, and its dry winds, and an\r\napproach to the damper regions of the many-mouthed Ganges.\r\n\r\nMy main object at Patna being to see the opium Godowns (stores), I\r\nwaited on Dr. Corbett, the Assistant-Agent, who kindly explained\r\neverything to me, and to whose obliging attentions I am much indebted.\r\n\r\nThe E.I. Company grant licences for the cultivation of the poppy, and\r\ncontract for all the produce at certain rates, varying with the\r\nquality. No opium can be grown without this licence, and an advance\r\nequal to about two-thirds of the value of the produce is made to the\r\ngrower. This produce is made over to district collectors, who\r\napproximately fix the worth of the contents of each jar, and forward it\r\nto Patna, where rewards are given for the best samples, and the worst\r\nare condemned without payment; but all is turned to some account in the\r\nreduction of the drug to a state fit for market.\r\n\r\nThe poppy flowers in the end of January and beginning of February, and\r\nthe capsules are sliced in February and March with a little instrument\r\nlike a saw, made of three iron plates with jagged edges, tied together.\r\nThe cultivation is very carefully conducted, nor are there any very\r\napparent means of improving this branch of commerce and revenue. During\r\nthe N.W., or dry winds, the best opium is procured, the worst during\r\nthe moist, or E. and N.E., when the drug imbibes moisture, and a watery\r\nbad solution of opium collects in cavities of its substance, and is\r\ncalled Passewa, according to the absence of which the opium is\r\ngenerally prized.\r\n\r\nAt the end of March the opium jars arrive at the stores by water and by\r\nland, and continue accumulating for some weeks. Every jar is labelled\r\nand stowed in a proper place, separately tested with extreme accuracy,\r\nand valued. When the whole quantity has been received, the contents of\r\nall the jars are thrown into great vats, occupying a very large\r\nbuilding, whence the mass is distributed, to be made up into balls for\r\nthe markets. This operation is carried on in a long paved room, where\r\nevery man is ticketed, and many overseers are stationed to see that the\r\nwork is properly conducted. Each workman sits on a stool, with a double\r\nstage and a tray before him. On the top stage is a tin basin,\r\ncontaining opium sufficient for three balls; in the lower another\r\nbasin, holding water: in the tray stands a brass hemispherical cup, in\r\nwhich the ball is worked. To the man’s right hand is another tray, with\r\ntwo compartments, one containing thin pancakes of poppy petals pressed\r\ntogether, the other a cupful of sticky opium-water, made from refuse\r\nopium. The man takes the brass cup, and places a pancake at the bottom,\r\nsmears it with opium-water, and with many plies of the pancakes makes a\r\ncoat for the opium. Of this he takes about one-third of the mass before\r\nhim, puts it inside the petals, and agglutinates many other coats over\r\nit: the balls are then again weighed, and reduced or increased to a\r\ncertain weight if necessary. At the day’s end, each man takes his work\r\nto a rack with numbered compartments, and deposits it in that which\r\nanswers to his own number, thence the balls (each being put in a clay\r\ncup) are carried to an enormous drying-room, where they are exposed in\r\ntiers, and constantly examined and turned, to prevent their being\r\nattacked by weevils, which are very prevalent during moist winds,\r\nlittle boys creeping along the racks all day long for this purpose.\r\nWhen dry, the balls are packed in two layers of six each in chests,\r\nwith the stalks, dried leaves, and capsules of the plant, and sent down\r\nto Calcutta. A little opium is prepared of very fine quality for the\r\nGovernment Hospitals, and some for general sale in India; but the\r\nproportion is trifling, and such is made up into square cakes. A good\r\nworkman will prepare from thirty to fifty balls a day, the total\r\nproduce being 10,000 to 12,000 a day; during one working season\r\n1,353,000 balls are manufactured for the Chinese market alone.\r\n\r\nThe poppy-petal _pancakes,_ each about a foot radius, are made in the\r\nfields by women, by the simple operation of pressing the fresh petals\r\ntogether. They are brought in large baskets, and purchased at the\r\ncommencement of the season. The liquor with which the pancakes are\r\nagglutinated together by the ball-maker, and worked into the ball, is\r\nmerely inspissated opium-water, the opium for which is derived from the\r\ncondemned opium, (Passewa,) the washing of the utensils, and of the\r\nworkmen, every one of whom is nightly laved before he leaves the\r\nestablishment, and the water is inspissated. Thus not a particle of\r\nopium is lost. To encourage the farmers, the refuse stalks, leaves, and\r\nheads are bought up, to pack the balls with; but this is far from an\r\neconomical plan, for it is difficult to keep the refuse from damp and\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nA powerful smell of opium pervaded these vast buildings, which Dr.\r\nCorbett[28] assured me did not affect himself or the assistants. The\r\nmen work ten hours a day, becoming sleepy in the afternoon; but this is\r\nonly natural in the hot season: they are rather liable to eruptive\r\ndiseases, possibly engendered by the nature of their occupation.\r\n\r\n [28] I am greatly indebted to Mr. Oldfield, the Opium Agent, and to\r\n Dr. Corbett, for a complete set of specimens, implements, and\r\n drawings, illustrating the cultivation and manufacture of Opium. They\r\n are exhibited in the Kew Museum of Economic Botany.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the best East Indian opium is inferior to the Turkish, and owing\r\nto peculiarities of climate, will probably always be so. It never\r\nyields more than five per cent. of morphia, whence its inferiority, but\r\nis as good in other respects, and even richer in narcotine.\r\n\r\nThe care and attention devoted to every department of collecting,\r\ntesting, manipulating, and packing, is quite extraordinary; and the\r\nresult has been an impulse to the trade, beyond what was anticipated.\r\nThe natives have been quick at apprehending and supplying the wants of\r\nthe market, and now there are more demands for licences to grow opium\r\nthan can be granted. All the opium eaten in India is given out with a\r\npermit to licensed dealers, and the drug is so adulterated before it\r\nreaches the retailers in the bazaars, that it does not contain\r\none-thirtieth part of the intoxicating power that it did when pure.\r\n\r\nPatna is the stronghold of Mahommedanism, and from its central\r\nposition, its command of the Ganges, and its proximity to Nepal (which\r\nlatter has been aptly compared to a drawn dagger, pointed at the heart\r\nof India), it is an important place. For this reason there are always a\r\nEuropean and several Native Regiments stationed there. In the\r\nneighbourbood there is little to be seen, and the highly cultivated\r\nflat country is unfavourable to native vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe _mudar_ plant (_Calotropis_) was abundant here, but I found that\r\nits properties and nomenclature were far from settled points. On the\r\nbanks of the Ganges, the larger, white-flowered, sub-arboreous species\r\nprevailed; in the interior, and along my whole previous route, the\r\nsmaller purple-flowered kind only was seen. Mr. Davis, of Rotas, was in\r\nthe habit of using the medicine copiously, and vouched for the cure of\r\neighty cases, chiefly of leprosy, by the _white mudar,_ gathered on the\r\nGanges, whilst the purple of Rotas and the neighbourhood was quite\r\ninert: Dr. Irvine, again, used the purple only, and found the white\r\ninert. The European and native doctors, who knew the two plants, all\r\ngave the preference to the _white_; except Dr. Irvine, whose experience\r\nover various parts of India is entitled to great weight.\r\n\r\n_March 29._—Dropped down the river, experiencing a succession of east\r\nand north-east winds during the whole remainder of the voyage. These\r\nwinds are very prevalent throughout the month of March, and they\r\nrendered the passage in my sluggish boat sufficiently tedious. In other\r\nrespects I had but little bad weather to complain of: only one shower\r\nof rain occurred, and but few storms of thunder and lightning. The\r\nstream is very strong, and its action on the sand-banks conspicuous.\r\nAll night I used to hear the falling cliffs precipitated with a dull\r\nheavy splash into the water,—a pretty spectacle in the day-time, when\r\nthe whirling current is seen to carry a cloud of white dust, like\r\nsmoke, along its course.\r\n\r\nThe Curruckpore hills, the northern boundary of the gneiss and granite\r\nrange of Paras-nath, are seen first in the distance, and then throwing\r\nout low loosely timbered spurs towards the river; but no rock or hill\r\ncomes close to the banks till near Monghyr, where two islets of rock\r\nrise out of the bed of the river. They are of stratified quartz,\r\ndipping, at a high angle, to the south-east; and, as far as I could\r\nobserve, quite barren, each crowned with a little temple. The swarm of\r\nboats from below Patna to this place was quite incredible.\r\n\r\n_April 1._—Arrived at Monghyr, by far the prettiest town I had seen on\r\nthe river, backed by a long range of wooded hills,—detached outliers of\r\nwhich rise in the very town. The banks are steep, and they appear more\r\nso owing to the fortifications, which are extensive. A number of large,\r\nwhite, two-storied houses, some very imposing, and perched on rounded\r\nor conical hills, give a European aspect to the place.\r\n\r\nMonghyr is celebrated for its iron manufactures, especially of muskets,\r\nin which respect it is the Birmingham of Bengal. Generally speaking,\r\nthese weapons are poor, though stamped with the first English names. A\r\nnative workman will, however, if time and sufficient reward be given,\r\nturn out a first rate fowling-piece. The inhabitants are reported to be\r\nsad drunkards, and the abundance of toddy-palms was quite remarkable.\r\nThe latter, (here the _Phœnix sylvestris,_) I never saw wild, but it is\r\nconsidered to be so in N.W. India; it is still a doubtful point whether\r\nit is the same as the African species. In the morning of the following\r\nday I went to the hot springs of Seeta-koond (wells of Seeta), a few\r\nmiles south of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monghyr on the Ganges, with the Curruckpore Hills in\r\nthe distance.]\r\n\r\nThe hills are hornstone and quartz, stratified and dipping southerly\r\nwith a very high angle; they are very barren, and evidently identical\r\nwith those on the south bank of the Soane; skirting, in both cases, the\r\ngranite and gneiss range of Paras-nath. The alluvium on the banks of\r\nthe Ganges is obviously an aqueous deposit subsequent to the elevation\r\nof these hills, and is perfectly plane up to their bases. The river has\r\nits course through the alluvium, like the Soane. The depth of the\r\nformer is in many places upwards of 100 feet, and the kunker pebbles it\r\ncontains are often disposed in parallel undulating bands. It nowhere\r\ncontains sand pebbles or fossils; concretions of lime (kunker) alone\r\ninterrupting its uniform consistence. It attains its greatest thickness\r\nin the valleys of the Ganges and the Soane, gradually sloping up to the\r\nHimalaya and Curruckpore hills on either flank. It is, however, well\r\ndeveloped on the Kymore and Paras-nath hills, 1,200 to 1 500 feet above\r\nthe Ganges valley, and I have no doubt was deposited in very deep\r\nwater, when the relative positions of these mountains to the Ganges and\r\nSoane valleys were the same that they are now. Like every other part of\r\nthe surface of India, it has suffered much from denudation, especially\r\non the above-named mountains, and around their bases, where various\r\nrocks protrude through it. Along the Ganges again, its surface is an\r\nunbroken level between Chunar and the rocks of Monghyr. The origin of\r\nits component mineral matter must be sought in the denudation of the\r\nHimalayas within a very recent geological period. The contrast between\r\nthe fertility of the alluvium and the sterility of the protruded\r\nquartzy rocks is very striking, cultivation running up to these fields\r\nof stones, and suddenly stopping.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Soorujkoond hot-springs, those of Seetakoond rise in a\r\nplain, and were once covered by a handsome temple. All the water is\r\ncollected in a tank, some yards square, with steps leading down to it.\r\nThe water, which is clear and tasteless (temp. 104°), is so pure as to\r\nbe exported copiously, and the Monghyr manufactory of soda-water\r\npresents the anomaly of owing its purity to Seeta’s ablutions.\r\n\r\nOn my passage down the river I passed the picturesque rocks of\r\nSultangunj; they are similar to those of Monghyr, but very much larger\r\nand loftier. One, a round-headed mass, stands on the bank, capped with\r\na triple-domed Mahommedan tomb, palms, and figs. The other, which is\r\nfar more striking, rises isolated in the bed of the river, and is\r\ncrowned with a Hindoo temple, its pyramidal cone surmounted with a\r\ncurious pile of weathercocks, and two little banners. The current of\r\nthe Ganges is here very strong, and runs in deep black eddies between\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nThough now perhaps eighty or a hundred yards from the shore, the islet\r\nmust have been recently a peninsula, for it retains a portion of the\r\nonce connecting bank of alluvium, in the form of a short flat-topped\r\ncliff, about thirty feet above the water. Some curious looking\r\nsculptures on the rocks are said to represent Naragur (or Vishnu),\r\nSuree and Sirooj; but to me they were quite unintelligible. The temple\r\nis dedicated to Naragur, and inhabited by Fakirs; it is the most holy\r\non the Ganges.\r\n\r\n_April 5._—I arrived at Bhagulpore, and took up my quarters with my\r\nfriend Dr. Grant, till he should arrange my dawk for Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThe town has been supposed to be the much-sought Palibothra, and a\r\ndirty stream hard by (the Chundum), the Eranoboas; but Mr. Ravenshaw\r\nhas now brought all existing proofs to bear on Patna and the Soane. It\r\nis, like most hilly places in India, S. of the Himalaya, the seat of\r\nmuch Jain worship; and the temples on Mount Manden,[29] a few miles\r\noff, are said to have been 540 in number. At the assumed summer-palaces\r\nof the kings of Palibothra the ground is covered with agates, brought\r\nfrom the neighbouring hills, which were, in a rough state, let into the\r\nwalls of the buildings. These agates perfectly resemble the Soane\r\npebbles, and they assist in the identification of these flanking hills\r\nwith those of the latter river.\r\n\r\n [29] For the following information about Bhagulpore and its\r\n neighbourhood, I am indebted chiefly to Col. Francklin’s essay in the\r\n Asiatic Researches; and the late Major Napleton and Mr. Pontet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, near the hills, the features of interest are very numerous. The\r\nneighbouring mountains of Curruckpore, which are a portion of the\r\nRajmahal and Paras-nath range, are peopled by tribes representing the\r\nearliest races of India, prior to the invasion of young Rama, prince of\r\nOude, who, according to the legend, spread Brahminism with his\r\nconquests, and won the hand of King Jannuk’s daughter, Seeta, by\r\nbending her father’s bow. These people are called Coles, a\r\nmiddle-sized, strong, very dark, and black-haired race, with thick\r\nlips: they have no vocation but collecting iron from the soil, which\r\noccurs abundantly in nodules. They eat flesh, whether that of animals\r\nkilled by themselves, or of those which have died a natural death, and\r\nmix with Hindoos, but not with Mussulmen. There are other tribes,\r\nvestiges of the Tamulian race, differing somewhat in their rites from\r\nthese, and approaching, in their habits, more to Hindoos; but all are\r\ntimorous and retiring.\r\n\r\nThe hill-rangers, or Bhagulpore-rangers, are all natives of the\r\nRajmahal hills, and form a local corps maintained by the Company for\r\nthe protection of the district. For many years these people were\r\nengaged in predatory excursions, which, owing to the nature of the\r\ncountry, were checked with great difficulty. The plan was therefore\r\nconceived, by an active magistrate in the district, of embodying a\r\nportion into a military force, for the protection of the country from\r\ninvasions of their own tribes; and this scheme has answered perfectly.\r\n\r\nTo me the most interesting object in Bhagulpore was the Horticultural\r\nGardens, whose origin and flourishing condition are due to the activity\r\nand enterprise of the late Major Napleton, commander of the\r\nhill-rangers. The site is good, consisting of fifteen acres, that were,\r\nfour years ago, an indigo field, but form now a smiling garden. About\r\nfifty men are employed; and the number of seeds and vegetables annually\r\ndistributed is very great. Of trees the most conspicuous are the\r\ntamarind, _Tecoma jasminoides, Erythrina, Adansonia, Bombax,_ teak,\r\nbanyan, peepul, _Sissoo, Casuarina, Terminalia, Melia, Bauhinia._ Of\r\nintroduced species English and Chinese flat peaches (pruned to the\r\ncentre to let the sun in), Mangos of various sorts, _Eugenia Jambos,_\r\nvarious Anonas, Litchi, Loquat and Longan, oranges, _Sapodilla_; apple,\r\npear, both succeeding tolerably; various Cabool and Persian varieties\r\nof fruit-trees; figs, grapes, guava, apricots, and jujube. The grapes\r\nlooked extremely well, but they require great skill and care in the\r\nmanagement. They form a long covered walk, with a row of plantains on\r\nthe W. side, to diminish the effects of the hot winds, but even with\r\nthis screen, the fruit on that side are inferior to that on the\r\nopposite trellis. Easterly winds, again, being moist, blight these and\r\nother plants, by favouring the abundant increase of insects, and\r\ncausing the leaves to curl and fall off; and against this evil there is\r\nno remedy. With a clear sky the mischief is not great; under a cloudy\r\none the prevalence of such winds is fatal to the crop. The white ant\r\nsometimes attacks the stems, and is best checked by washing the roots\r\nwith limewater, yellow arsenic, or tobacco-water. Numerous Cerealia,\r\nand the varieties of cotton, sugar-cane, etc. all thrive extremely\r\nwell; so do many of our English vegetables. Cabbages, peas, and beans\r\nare much injured by the caterpillars of a _Pontia,_ like our English\r\n“White;” raspberries, currants, and gooseberries will not grow at all.\r\n\r\nThe seeds were all deposited in bottles, and hung round the walls of a\r\nlarge airy apartment; and for cleanliness and excellence of kind they\r\nwould bear comparison with the best seedsman’s collection in London. Of\r\nEnglish garden vegetables, and varieties of the Indian Cerealia, and\r\nleguminous plants, Indian corn, millets, rice, etc., the collections\r\nfor distribution were extensive.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of economic products is not neglected. Excellent coffee\r\nis grown; and arrow-root, equal to the best West Indian, is prepared,\r\nat 18_s._ 6_d._ per bottle of twenty-four ounces, about a fourth of the\r\nprice of that article in Calcutta.\r\n\r\nIn most respects the establishment is a model of what such institutions\r\nought to be in India; not only of real practical value, in affording a\r\ngood and cheap supply of the best culinary and other vegetables that\r\nthe climate can produce, but as showing to what departments efforts are\r\nbest directed. Such gardens diffuse a taste for the most healthy\r\nemployments, and offer an elegant resource for the many unoccupied\r\nhours which the Englishman in India finds upon his hands. They are also\r\nschools of gardening; and a simple inspection of what has been done at\r\nBhagulpore is a valuable lesson to any person about to establish a\r\nprivate garden of his own.\r\n\r\nI often heard complaints made of the seeds distributed from these\r\ngardens not vegetating freely in other parts of India, and it is not to\r\nbe expected that they should retain their vitality unimpaired through\r\nan Indian rainy season; but on the other hand I almost invariably found\r\nthat the planting and tending had been left to the uncontrolled\r\nmanagement of native gardeners, who with a certain amount of skill in\r\nhandicraft are, from habits and prejudices, singularly unfit for the\r\nsuperintendence of a garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nLeave Bhagulpore—Kunker—Colgong—Himalaya, distant view of—Cosi, mouth\r\nof—Difficult navigation—Sand\r\nstorms—Caragola-Ghat—Purnea—Ortolans—Mahanuddee, transport of pebbles,\r\netc.—Betel-pepper, cultivation of—Titalya—Siligoree—View of outer\r\nHimalaya—Terai—Mechis—Punkabaree—Foot of mountains—Ascent to\r\nDorjiling—Cicadas—Leeches—Animals—Kursiong, spring vegetation\r\nof—Pacheem—Arrive at Dorjiling—Dorjiling, origin and settlement\r\nof—Grant of land from Rajah—Dr. Campbell appointed\r\nsuperintendent—Dewan, late and present—Aggressive conduct of the\r\nlatter—Increase of the station—Trade—Titalya fair—Healtby climate for\r\nEuropeans and children—Invalids, diseases prejudicial to.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took as it were, a new departure, on Saturday, April the 8th, my dawk\r\nbeing laid on that day from Caragola-Ghat, about thirty miles down the\r\nriver, for the foot of the Himalaya range and Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nPassing the pretty villa-like houses of the English residents, the\r\nriver-banks re-assumed their wonted features the hills receded from the\r\nshore; and steep clay cliffs, twenty to fifty feet high, on one side,\r\nopposed long sandy shelves on the other. Kunker was still most\r\nabundant, especially in the lower bed of the banks, close to the (now\r\nvery low) water. The strata containing it were much undulated, but not\r\nuniformly so; horizontal layers over or under-lying the disturbed ones.\r\nAt Colgong, conical hills appear, and two remarkable sister-rocks start\r\nout of the river, the same in structure with those of Sultangunj. A\r\nboisterous current swirls round them, strong even at this season, and\r\nvery dangerous in the rains, when the swollen river is from\r\ntwenty-eight to forty feet deeper than now. We landed opposite the\r\nrocks, and proceeded to the residence of Mr. G. Barnes, prettily\r\nsituated on one of the conical elevations characteristic of the geology\r\nof the district. The village we passed through had been recently\r\ndestroyed by fire; and nothing but the clay outer walls and\r\ncurious-looking partition walls remained, often white-washed and daubed\r\nwith figures in red of the palm of the hand, elephant, peacock, and\r\ntiger,—a sort of rude fresco-painting. We did not arrive till past\r\nmid-day, and the boat, with my palkee and servant, not having been able\r\nto face the gale, I was detained till the middle of the following day.\r\nMr. Barnes and his brother proved most agreeable companions,—very\r\nluckily for me, for it requires no ordinary philosophy to bear being\r\nstorm-stayed on a voyage, with the prospect of paying a heavy demurrage\r\nfor detaining the dawk, and the worse one of finding the bearers given\r\nto another traveller when you arrive at the rendezvous. The view from\r\nMr. Barnes’ house is very fine: it commands the river and its rocks;\r\nthe Rajmahal hills to the east and south; broad acres of indigo and\r\nother crops below; long lines of palm-trees, and groves of mango,\r\nbanana, tamarind, and other tropical trees, scattered close around and\r\nin the distance. In the rainy season, and immediately after, the snowy\r\nHimalaya are distinctly seen on the horizon, fully 170 miles off.\r\nNearly opposite, the Cosi river enters the Ganges, bearing (considering\r\nits short course) an enormous volume of water, comprising the drainage\r\nof the whole Himalaya between the two giant peaks of Kinchinjunga in\r\nSikkim, and Gossain-Than in Nepal. Even at this season, looking from\r\nMr. Barnes’ eyrie over the bed of the Ganges, the enormous expanses of\r\nsand, the numerous shifting islets, and the long spits of mud betray\r\nthe proximity of some very restless and resistless power. During the\r\nrains, the scene must indeed be extraordinary, when the Cosi lays many\r\nmiles of land under water, and pours so vast a quantity of detritus\r\ninto the bed of the Ganges that long islets are heaped up and swept\r\naway in a few hours; and the latter river becomes all but unnavigable.\r\nBoats are caught in whirlpools, formed without a moment’s warning, and\r\nsunk ere they have spun round thrice in the eddies; and no part of the\r\ninland navigation of India is so dreaded or dangerous, as the Ganges at\r\nits junction with the Cosi.\r\n\r\nRain generally falls in partial showers at this season, and they are\r\nessential to the well-being of the spring crops of indigo. The stormy\r\nappearance of the sky, though it proved fallacious, was hailed by my\r\nhosts as predicting a fall, which was much wanted. The wind however\r\nseemed but to aggravate the drought, by the great body of sand it\r\nlifted and swept up the valleys, obscuring the near horizon, and\r\nespecially concealing the whole delta of the Cosi, where the clouds\r\nwere so vast and dense, and ascended so high as to resemble another\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nAll night the gale blew on, accompanied with much thunder and\r\nlightning, and it was not till noon of the 9th that I descried my\r\npalkee-boat toiling down the stream. Then I again embarked, taking the\r\nlagging boat in tow of my own. Passing the mouths of the Cosi, the gale\r\nand currents were so adverse that we had to bring up on the sand, when\r\nthe quantity which drifted into the boat rendered the delay as\r\ndisagreeable as it was tedious. The particles penetrated everywhere, up\r\nmy nose and down my back, drying my eyelids, and gritting between my\r\nteeth. The craft kept bumping on the banks, and being both crazy and\r\nleaky, the little comfortless cabin became the refuge of scared rats\r\nand cockroaches. In the evening I shared a meal with these creatures,\r\non some provisions my kind friends had put into the boat, but the food\r\nwas so sandy that I had to bolt my supper!\r\n\r\nAt night the storm lulled a little, and I proceeded to Caragola Ghat\r\nand took up my dawk, which had been twenty-eight hours expecting me,\r\nand was waiting, in despair of my arrival, for another traveller on the\r\nopposite bank, who however could not cross the river.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished thirty miles, I halted at 9 a..m. on the following\r\nmorning at Purnea, quitting it at noon for Kishengunj. The whole\r\ncountry wore a greener garb than I had seen anywhere south of the\r\nGanges: the climate was evidently more humid, and had been gradually\r\nbecoming so from Mirzapore. The first decided change was a few miles\r\nbelow the Soane mouth, at Dinapore and Patna; and the few hygrometrical\r\nobservations I took at Bhagulpore confirmed the increase of moisture.\r\nThe proximity to the sea and great Delta of the Ganges sufficiently\r\naccounts for this; as does the approach to the hills for the still\r\ngreater dampness and brighter verdure of Purnea. I was glad to feel\r\nmyself within the influence of the long-looked-for Himalaya; and I\r\nnarrowly watched every change in the character of the vegetation. A\r\nfern, growing by the roadside, was the first and most tangible evidence\r\nof this; together with the rarity or total absence of _Butea,\r\nBoswellia, Catechu, Grislea, Carissa,_ and all the companions of my\r\nformer excursion.\r\n\r\nPurnea is a large station, and considered very unhealthy during and\r\nafter the rains. From it the road passed through some pretty lanes,\r\nwith groves of planted Guava and a rattan palm (_Calamus_), the first I\r\nhad seen. Though no hills are nearer than the Himalaya, from the\r\nconstant alteration of the river-beds, the road undulates remarkably\r\nfor this part of India, and a jungly vegetation ensues, consisting of\r\nthe above plants, with the yellow-flowered Cactus replacing the\r\nEuphorbias, which were previously much more common. Though still 100\r\nmiles distant from the hills, mosses appeared on the banks, and more\r\nferns were just sprouting above ground.\r\n\r\nThe Bamboo was a very different species from any I had hitherto met\r\nwith, forming groves of straight trees fifteen to twenty feet high,\r\nthin of foliage, and not unlike poplars.\r\n\r\nThirty-six miles from Purnea brought me to Kishengunj, when I found\r\nthat no arrangements whatever had been made for my dawk, and I was\r\nfairly stranded. Luckily a thoughtful friend had provided me with\r\nletters to the scattered residents along the road, and I proceeded with\r\none to Mr. Perry, the assistant magistrate of the district,—a gentleman\r\nwell known for his urbanity, and the many aids he affords to travellers\r\non this neglected line of road. Owing to this being some festival or\r\nholiday, it was impossible to get palkee-bearers; the natives were busy\r\ncatching fish in all the muddy pools around. Some of Mr. Perry’s own\r\nfamily also were about to proceed to Dorjiling, so that I had only to\r\ntake patience, and be thankful for having to exercise it in such\r\npleasant quarters. The Mahanuddee, a large stream from the hills, flows\r\nnear this place, strewing the surrounding neighbourhood with sand, and\r\nfrom the frequent alterations in its course, causing endless disputes\r\namongst the landholders. A kind of lark called an Ortolan was abundant:\r\nthis is not, however, the European delicacy of that name, though a\r\nmigratory bird; the flocks are large, and the birds so fat, that they\r\nmake excellent table game. At this time they were rapidly disappearing;\r\nto return from the north in September. I had just got into bed at\r\nnight, when the bearers arrived; so bidding a hurried adieu to my kind\r\nhost, I proceeded onwards.\r\n\r\n_April 12._—I awoke at 4 a.m., and found my palkee on the ground, and\r\nthe bearers coolly smoking their hookahs under a tree (it was raining\r\nhard): they had carried me the length of their stage, twelve miles, and\r\nthere were no others to take me on. I had paid twenty-four pounds for\r\nmy dawk, from Caragola to the hills, to which I had been obliged to add\r\na handsome douceur; so I lost all patience. After waiting and\r\nentreating during several hours, I found the head-man of a neighbouring\r\nvillage, and by a further disbursement induced six out of the twelve\r\nbearers to carry the empty palkee, whilst I should walk to the next\r\nstage; or till we should meet some others. They agreed, and cutting the\r\nthick and spongy sheaths of the banana, used them for shoulder-pads:\r\nthey also wrapped them round the palkee-poles, to ease their aching\r\nclavicles. Walking along I picked up a few plants, and fourteen miles\r\nfurther on came again to the banks of the Mahanuddee, whose bed was\r\nstrewn with pebbles and small boulders, brought thus far from the\r\nmountains (about thirty miles distant). Here, again, I had to apply to\r\nthe head-man of a village, and pay for bearers to take me to Titalya,\r\nthe next stage (fourteen miles). Some curious long low sheds puzzled me\r\nvery much, and on examining them they proved to be for the growth of\r\nPawn or Betel-pepper, another indication of the moisture of the\r\nclimate. These sheds are twenty to fifty yards long, eight or twelve or\r\nso broad, and scarcely five high; they are made of bamboo, wattled all\r\nround and over the top. Slender rods are placed a few feet apart,\r\ninside, up which the Pepper Vines climb, and quickly fill the place\r\nwith their deep green glossy foliage. The native enters every morning\r\nby a little door, and carefully cleans the plants. Constant heat, damp,\r\nand moisture, shelter from solar beams, from scorching heat, and from\r\nnocturnal radiation, are thus all procured for the plant, which would\r\ncertainly not live twenty-four hours, if exposed to the climate of this\r\ntreeless district. Great attention is paid to the cultivation, which is\r\nvery profitable. Snakes frequently take up their quarters in these\r\nhot-houses, and cause fatal accidents.\r\n\r\nTitalya was once a military station of some importance, and from its\r\nproximity to the hills has been selected by Dr. Campbell (the\r\nSuperintendent of Dorjiling) as the site for an annual fair, to which\r\nthe mountain tribes resort, as well as the people of the plains. The\r\nCalcutta road to Dorjiling by Dinajpore meets, near here, that by which\r\nI had come; and I found no difficulty in procuring bearers to proceed\r\nto Siligoree, where I arrived at 6 a.m. on the 13th. Hitherto I bad not\r\nseen the mountains, so uniformly had they been shrouded by dense\r\nwreaths of vapour: here, however, when within eight miles of their\r\nbase, I caught a first glimpse of the outer range—sombre masses, of far\r\nfrom picturesque outline, clothed everywhere with a dusky forest.\r\n\r\nSiligoree stands on the verge of the Terai, that low malarious belt\r\nwhich skirts the base of the Himalaya, from the Sutlej to Brahma-koond\r\nin Upper Assam. Every feature, botanical, geological, and zoological,\r\nis new on entering this district. The change is sudden and immediate:\r\nsea and shore are hardly more conspicuously different, nor from the\r\nedge of the Terai to the limit of perpetual snow is any botanical\r\nregion more clearly marked than this, which is the commencement of\r\nHimalayan vegetation. A sudden descent leads to the Mahanuddee river,\r\nflowing in a shallow valley, over a pebbly bottom: it is a rapid river,\r\neven at this season; its banks are fringed with bushes, and it is as\r\nclear and sparkling as a trout stream in Scotland. Beyond it the road\r\nwinds through a thick brushwood, choked with long grasses, and with but\r\nfew trees, chiefly of _Acacia, Dalbergia Sissoo,_ and a scarlet fruited\r\n_Sterculia._ The soil is a red, friable clay and gravel. At this season\r\nonly a few spring plants were in flower, amongst which a very\r\nsweet-scented _Crinum,_ Asphodel, and a small _Curcuma,_ were in the\r\ngreatest profusion. Leaves of terrestrial Orchids appeared, with ferns\r\nand weeds of hot damp regions. I crossed the beds of many small\r\nstreams: some were dry, and all very tortuous; their banks were richly\r\nclothed with brushwood and climbers of Convolvulus, Vines, _Hiræa,\r\nLeea, Menispermeæ, Cucurbitaceæ,_ and _Bignoniaceæ._ Their pent-up\r\nwaters, percolating the gravel beds, and partly carried off by\r\nevaporation through the stratum of ever-increasing vegetable mould,\r\nmust be one main agent in the production of the malarious vapours of\r\nthis pestilential region. Add to this, the detention of the same\r\namongst the jungly herbage, the amount of vapour in the humid\r\natmosphere above, checking the upward passage of that from the soil,\r\nthe sheltered nature of the locality at the immediate base of lofty\r\nmountains; and there appear to me to be here all necessary elements,\r\nwhich, combined, will produce stagnation and deterioration in an\r\natmosphere loaded with vapour. Fatal as this district is, and\r\nespecially to Europeans, a race inhabit it with impunity, who, if not\r\nnumerous, do not owe their paucity to any climatic causes. These are\r\nthe Mechis, often described as a squalid, unhealthy people, typical of\r\nthe region they frequent; but who are, in reality, more robust than the\r\nEuropeans in India, and whose disagreeably sallow complexion is\r\ndeceptive as indicating a sickly constitution. They are a mild,\r\ninoffensive people, industrious for Orientals, living by annually\r\nburning the Terai jungle and cultivating the cleared spots; and, though\r\nso sequestered and isolated, they rather court than avoid intercourse\r\nwith those whites whom they know to be kindly disposed.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding some six miles along the gradually ascending path, I\r\ncame to a considerable stream, cutting its way through stratified\r\ngravel, with cliffs on each side fifteen to twenty feet high, here and\r\nthere covered with ferns, the little _Oxalis sensitiva,_ and other\r\nherbs. The road here suddenly ascends a steep gravelly hill, and opens\r\nout on a short flat, or spur, from which the Himalaya rise abruptly,\r\nclothed with forest from the base: the little bungalow of Punkabaree,\r\nmy immediate destination, nestled in the woods, crowning a lateral\r\nknoll, above which, to east and west, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nwere range after range of wooded mountains, 6000 to 8000 feet high. I\r\nhere met with the India-rubber tree (_Ficus elastica_); it abounds in\r\nAssam, but this is its western limit.\r\n\r\nFrom this steppe, the ascent to Punkabaree is sudden and steep, and\r\naccompanied with a change in soil and vegetation. The mica slate and\r\nclay slate protrude everywhere, the former full of garnets. A giant\r\nforest replaces the stunted and bushy timber of the Terai Proper; of\r\nwhich the _Duabanga_ and _Terminalias_ form the prevailing trees, with\r\n_Cedrela_ and the _Gordonia Wallichii._ Smaller timber and shrubs are\r\ninnumerable; a succulent character pervades the bushes and herbs,\r\noccasioned by the prevalence of _Urticeæ._ Large bamboos rather crest\r\nthe hills than court the deeper shade, and of the latter there is\r\nabundance, for the torrents cut a straight, deep, and steep course down\r\nthe hill flanks: the galleys they traverse are choked with vegetation\r\nand bridged by fallen trees, whose trunks are richly clothed with\r\n_Dendrobium Pierardi_ and other epiphytical Orchids, with pendulous\r\n_Lycopodia_ and many ferns, _Hoya, Scitamineæ,_ and similar types of\r\nthe hottest and dampest climates.\r\n\r\nThe bungalow at Punkabaree was good—which was well, as my\r\nluggage-bearers were not come up, and there were no signs of them along\r\nthe Terai road, which I saw winding below me. My scanty stock of paper\r\nbeing full of plants, I was reduced to the strait of botanising, and\r\nthrowing away my specimens. The forest was truly magnificent along the\r\nsteep mountain sides. The apparently large proportion of deciduous\r\ntrees was far more considerable than I had expected; partly, probably,\r\ndue to the abundance of the _Dillenia, Cassia,_ and _Sterculia,_ whose\r\ncopious fruit was all the more conspicuous from the leafless condition\r\nof the plant. The white or lilac blossoms of the convolvuluslike\r\n_Thunbergia,_ and other _Acanthaceæ_ were the predominant features of\r\nthe shrubby vegetation, and very handsome.\r\n\r\nAll around, the hills rise steeply five or six thousand feet, clothed\r\nin a dense deep-green dripping forest. Torrents rush down the slopes,\r\ntheir position indicated by the dipping of the forest into their beds,\r\nor the occasional cloud of spray rising above some more boisterous part\r\nof their course. From the road, at and a little above Punkabaree, the\r\nview is really superb, and very instructive. Behind (or north) the\r\nHimalaya rise in steep confused masses. Below, the hill on which I\r\nstood, and the ranges as far as the eye can reach east and west, throw\r\nspurs on to the plains of India. These are very thickly wooded, and\r\nenclose broad, dead-flat, hot and damp valleys, apparently covered with\r\na dense forest. Secondary spurs of clay and gravel, like that\r\nimmediately below Punkabaree, rest on the bases of the mountains, and\r\nseem to form an intermediate neutral ground between flat and\r\nmountainous India. The Terai district forms a very irregular belt,\r\nscantily clothed, and intersected by innumerable rivulets from the\r\nhills, which unite and divide again on the flat, till, emerging from\r\nthe region of many trees, they enter the plains, following devious\r\ncourses, which glisten like silver threads. The whole horizon is\r\nbounded by the sea-like expanse of the plains, which stretch away into\r\nthe region of sunshine and fine weather, in one boundless flat.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, the courses of the Teesta and Cosi, the great drainers\r\nof the snowy Himalayas, and the recipients of innumerable smaller\r\nrills, are with difficulty traced at this, the dry season. The\r\nocean-like appearance of this southern view is even more conspicuous in\r\nthe heavens than on the land, the clouds arranging themselves after a\r\nsingularly sea-scape fashion. Endless strata run in parallel ribbons\r\nover the extreme horizon; above these, scattered cumuli, also in\r\nhorizontal lines, are dotted against a clear grey sky, which gradually,\r\nas the eye is lifted, passes into a deep cloudless blue vault,\r\ncontinuously clear to the zenith; there the cumuli, in white fleecy\r\nmasses, again appear; till, in the northern celestial hemisphere, they\r\nthicken and assume the leaden hue of nimbi, discharging their moisture\r\non the dark forest-clad hills around. The breezes are south-easterly,\r\nbringing that vapour from the Indian Ocean, which is rarefied and\r\nsuspended aloft over the heated plains, but condensed into a drizzle\r\nwhen it strikes the cooler flanks of the hills, and into heavy rain\r\nwhen it meets their still colder summits. Upon what a gigantic scale\r\ndoes nature here operate! Vapours, raised from an ocean whose nearest\r\nshore is more than 400 miles distant, are safely transported without\r\nthe loss of one drop of water, to support the rank luxuriance of this\r\nfar distant region. This and other offices fulfilled, the waste waters\r\nare returned, by the Cosi and Teesta, to the ocean, and again exhaled,\r\nexported, expended, re-collected, and returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Punkabaree, Sikkim Terai, and Balasun River.]\r\n\r\nThe soil and bushes everywhere swarmed with large and troublesome ants,\r\nand enormous earthworms. In the evening, the noise of the great\r\n_Cicadæ_ in the trees was almost deafening. They burst suddenly into\r\nfull chorus, with a voice so harshly croaking, so dissonant, and so\r\nunearthly, that in these solitary forests I could not help being\r\nstartled. In general character the note was very similar to that of\r\nother _Cicadæ._ They ceased as suddenly as they commenced. On the\r\nfollowing morning my baggage arrived, and, leaving my palkee, I mounted\r\na pony kindly sent for me by Mr. Hodgson, and commenced a very steep\r\nascent of about 3000 feet, winding along the face of a steep,\r\nrichly-wooded valley. The road zigzags extraordinarily in and out of\r\nthe innumerable lateral ravines, each with its water course, dense\r\njungle, and legion of leeches; the bite of these blood-suckers gives no\r\npain, but is fo1lowed by considerable effusion of blood. They puncture\r\nthrough thick worsted stockings, and even trousers, and, when full,\r\nroll in the form of a little soft ball into the bottom of the shoe,\r\nwhere their presence is hardly felt in walking.\r\n\r\nNot only are the roadsides rich in plants, but native paths, cutting\r\noff all the zigzags, run in straight lines up the steepest hill-faces,\r\nand thus double the available means for botanising; and it is all but\r\nimpossible to leave the paths of one kind or other, except for a yard\r\nor two up the rocky ravines. Elephants, tigers, and occasionally the\r\nrhinoceros, inhabit the foot of these hills, with wild boars, leopards,\r\netc.; but none are numerous. The elephant’s path is an excellent\r\nspecimen of engineering—the opposite of the native track, for it winds\r\njudiciously.\r\n\r\nAt about 1000 feet above Punkabaree, the vegetation is very rich, and\r\nappears all the more so from the many turnings of the road, affording\r\nglorious prospects of the foreshortened tropical forests. The prevalent\r\ntimber is gigantic, and scaled by climbing _Leguminosæ,_ as _Bauhinias_\r\nand _Robinias,_ which sometimes sheath the trunks, or span the forest\r\nwith huge cables, joining tree to tree. Their trunks are also clothed\r\nwith parasitical Orchids, and still more beautifully with Pothos\r\n(_Scindapsus_), Peppers, _Gnetum,_ Vines, Convolvulus, and _Bignoniæ._\r\nThe beauty of the drapery of the Pothos-leaves is pre-eminent, whether\r\nfor the graceful folds the foliage assumes, or for the liveliness of\r\nits colour. Of the more conspicuous smaller trees, the wild banana is\r\nthe most abundant, its crown of very beautiful foliage contrasting with\r\nthe smaller-leaved plants amongst which it nestles; next comes a\r\nscrew-pine (_Pandanus_) with a straight stem and a tuft of leaves; each\r\neight or ten feet long, waving on all sides. _Araliaceæ,_ with smooth\r\nor armed slender trunks, and _Mappa_-like _Euphorbiaceæ,_ spread their\r\nlong petioles horizontally forth, each terminated with an ample leaf\r\nsome feet in diameter. Bamboo abounds everywhere: its dense tufts of\r\nculms, 100 feet and upwards high, are as thick as a man’s thigh at the\r\nbase. Twenty or thirty, species of ferns (including a tree-fern) were\r\nluxuriant and handsome. Foliaceous lichens and a few mosses appeared at\r\n2000 feet. Such is the vegetation of the roads through the tropical\r\nforests of the Outer-Himalaya.\r\n\r\nAt about 4000 feet the road crossed a saddle, and ran along the narrow\r\ncrest of a hill, the top of that facing the plains of India, and over\r\nwhich is the way to the interior ranges, amongst which Dorjiling is\r\nplaced, still twenty-five miles off. A little below this a great change\r\nhad taken place in the vegetation, marked, first, by the appearance of\r\na very English-looking bramble, which, however, by way of proving its\r\nforeign origin, bore a very good yellow fruit, called here the “yellow\r\nraspberry.” Scattered oaks, of a noble species, with large lamellated\r\ncups and magnificent foliage, succeeded; and along the ridge of the\r\nmountain to Kursiong (a dawk bungalow at about 4,800 feet), the change\r\nin the flora was complete.\r\n\r\nThe spring of this region and elevation most vividly recalled that of\r\nEngland. The oak flowering, the birch bursting into leaf, the violet,\r\n_Chrysosplenium, Stellaria_ and _Arum, Vaccinium,_ wild strawberry,\r\nmaple, geranium, bramble. A colder wind blew here: mosses and lichens\r\ncarpeted the banks and roadsides: the birds and insects were very\r\ndifferent from those below; and everything proclaimed the marked change\r\nin elevation, and not only in this, but in season, for I had left the\r\nwinter of the tropics and here encountered the spring of the temperate\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nThe flowers I have mentioned are so notoriously the harbingers of a\r\nEuropean spring that their presence carries one home at once; but, as\r\nspecies, they differ from their European prototypes, and are\r\naccompanied at this elevation (and for 2000 feet higher up) with\r\ntree-fern, Pothos, bananas, palms, figs, pepper, numbers of epiphytal\r\nOrchids, and similar genuine tropical genera. The uniform temperature\r\nand humidity of the region here favour the extension of tropical plants\r\ninto a temperate region; exactly as the same conditions cause similar\r\nforms to reach higher latitudes in the southern hemisphere (as in New\r\nZealand, Tasmania, South Chili, etc.) than they do in the northern.\r\n\r\nAlong this ridge I met with the first tree-fern. This species seldom\r\nreaches the height of forty feet; the black trunk is but three or four\r\nin girth, and the feathery crown is ragged in comparison with the\r\nspecies of many other countries: it is the _Alsophila gigantea,_ and\r\nascends nearly to 7000 feet elevation.\r\n\r\nKursiong bungalow, where I stopped for a few hours, is superbly placed,\r\non a narrow mountain ridge. The west window looks down the valley of\r\nthe Balasun river, the east into that of the Mahanuddee: both of these\r\nrise from the outer range, and flow in broad, deep, and steep valleys\r\n(about 4000 feet deep) which give them their respective names; and are\r\nrichly wooded from the Terai to their tops. Till reaching this spur, I\r\nhad wound upwards along the western slope of the Mahanuddee valley. The\r\nascent from the spur at Kursiong, to the top of the mountain (on the\r\nnorthern face of which Dorjiling is situated), is along the eastern\r\nslope of the Balasun.\r\n\r\nFrom Kursiong a very steep zigzag leads up the mountain, through a\r\nmagnificent forest of cbesnut, walnut, oaks, and laurels. It is\r\ndifficult to conceive a grander mass of vegetation: the straight shafts\r\nof the timber-trees shooting aloft, some naked and clean, with grey,\r\npale, or brown bark; others literally clothed for yards with a\r\ncontinuous garment of epiphytes, one mass of blossoms, especially the\r\nwhite Orchids _Cælogynes,_ which bloom in a profuse manner, whitening\r\ntheir trunks like snow. More bulky trunks were masses of interlacing\r\nclimbers, _Araliaceæ, Leguminosæ, Vines,_ and _Menispermeæ,_ Hydrangea,\r\nand Peppers, enclosing a hollow, once filled by the now strangled\r\nsupporting tree, which had long ago decayed away. From the sides and\r\nsummit of these, supple branches hung forth, either leafy or naked; the\r\nlatter resembling cables flung from one tree to another, swinging in\r\nthe breeze, their rocking motion increased by the weight of great\r\nbunches of ferns or Orchids, which were perched aloft in the loops.\r\nPerpetual moisture nourishes this dripping forest: and pendulous mosses\r\nand lichens are met with in profusion.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand feet higher up, near Mahaldiram (whence the last view of\r\nthe plains is gained), European plants appear,—Berberry, _Paris,_ etc.;\r\nbut here, night gathered round, and I had still ten miles to go to the\r\nnearest bungalow, that of Pacheem. The road still led along the eastern\r\nslope of the Balasun valley, which was exceedingly steep, and so cut up\r\nby ravines, that it winds in and out of gulleys almost narrow enough to\r\nbe jumped across.\r\n\r\nIt was very late before I arrived at Pacheem bungalow, the most\r\nsinister-looking rest-house I ever saw, stuck on a little cleared spur\r\nof the mountain, surrounded by dark forests, overhanging a profound\r\nvalley, and enveloped in mists and rain, and hideous in architecture,\r\nbeing a miserable attempt to unite the Swiss cottage with the suburban\r\ngothic; it combined a maximum of discomfort with a minimum of good\r\nlooks or good cheer. I was some time in finding the dirty housekeeper,\r\nin an outhouse hard by, and then in waking him. As he led me up the\r\ncrazy verandah, and into a broad ghostly room, without glass in the\r\nwindows, or fire, or any one comfort, my mind recurred to the stories\r\ntold of the horrors of the Hartz forest, and of the benighted\r\ntraveller’s situation therein. Cold sluggish beetles hung to the damp\r\nwalls,—and these I immediately secured. After due exertions and\r\nperseverance with the damp wood, a fire smoked lustily, and, by\r\ncajoling the gnome of a housekeeper, I procured the usual roast fowl\r\nand potatos, with the accustomed sauce of a strong smoky and singed\r\nflavour.[30]\r\n\r\n [30] Since writing the above a comfortable house has been erected at\r\n Senadah, the name now given to what was called Pacheem Bungalow.\r\n\r\n\r\nPacheem stands at an elevation of nearly 7300 feet, and as I walked out\r\non the following morning I met with English looking plants in\r\nabundance, but was too early in the season to get aught but the foliage\r\nof most. _Chryosplenium,_ violet, _Lobelia,_ a small geranium,\r\nstrawberry, five or six kinds of bramble, _Arum, Paris, Convallaria,\r\nStellaria, Rubia, Vaccinium,_ and various _Gnaphalia._ Of small bushes,\r\ncornels, honeysuckles, and the ivy tribe predominated, with _Symplocos_\r\nand _Skimmia, Eurya,_ bushy brambles, having simple or compound green\r\nor beautifully silky foliage; _Hypericum,_ Berberry, Hydrangea,\r\nWormwood, _Adamia cyanea, Viburnum,_ Elder, dwarf bamboo, etc.\r\n\r\nThe climbing plants were still _Panax_ or _Aralia, Kadsura, Saurauja,\r\nHydrangea,_ Vines, _Smilax, Ampelopsis, Polygona,_ and, most beautiful\r\nof all, _Stauntonia,_ with pendulous racemes of lilac blossoms.\r\nEpiphytes were rarer, still I found white and purple _Cæloynes,_ and\r\nother Orchids, and a most noble white Rhododendron, whose truly\r\nenormous and delicious lemon-scented blossoms strewed the ground. The\r\ntrees were one half oaks, one quarter Magnolias, and nearly another\r\nquarter laurels, amongst which grew Himalayan kinds of birch, alder,\r\nmaple, holly, bird-cherry, common cherry, and apple. The absence of\r\n_Leguminosæ_ was most remarkable, and the most prominent botanical\r\nfeature in the vegetation of this region: it is too high for the\r\ntropical tribes of the warmer elevations, too low for the Alpines, and\r\nprobably too moist for those of temperate regions; cool, equable, humid\r\nclimates being generally unfavourable to that order. Clematis was rare,\r\nand other _Ranunculaceæ_ still more so. _Cruciferæ_ were absent, and,\r\nwhat was still more remarkable, I found very few native species of\r\ngrasses. Both _Poa annua_ and white Dutch clover flourished where\r\naccidentally disseminated, but only in artificially cleared spots. Of\r\nferns I collected about sixty species, chiefly of temperate genera. The\r\nsupremacy of this temperate region consists in the infinite number of\r\nforest trees, in the absence (in the usual proportion, at any rate) of\r\nsuch common orders as _Compositæ, Leguminosæ, Cruciferæ,_ and\r\n_Ranunculaceæ,_ and of Grasses amongst Monocotyledons, and in the\r\npredominance of the rarer and more local families, as those of\r\nRhododendron, Camellia, Magnolia, Ivy, Cornel, Honeysuckle, Hydrangea,\r\nBegonia, and Epiphytic orchids.\r\n\r\nFrom Pacheem, the road runs in a northerly direction to Dorjiling,\r\nstill along the Balasun valley, till the saddle of the great mountain\r\nSinchul is crossed. This is narrow, stretching east and west, and from\r\nit a spur projects northwards for five or six miles, amongst the many\r\nmountains still intervening between it and the snows. This saddle (alt.\r\n7,400 feet) crossed, one is fairly amongst the mountains: the plains\r\nbehind are cut off by it; and in front, the snows may be seen when the\r\nweather is propitious. The valleys on this side of the mountain run\r\nnorthwards, and discharge their streams into great rivers, which,\r\ncoming from the snow, wind amongst the hills, and debouche into the\r\nTeesta, to the east, where it divides Sikkim from Bhotan.\r\n\r\nDorjiling station occupies a narrow ridge, which divides into two\r\nspurs, descending steeply to the bed of the Great Rungeet river, up\r\nwhose course the eye is carried to the base of the great snowy\r\nmountains. The ridge itself is very narrow at the top, along which most\r\nof the houses are perched, while others occupy positions on its flanks,\r\nwhere narrow _locations_ on the east, and broader ones on the west, are\r\ncleared from wood. The valleys on either side are at least 6000 feet\r\ndeep, forest-clad to the bottom, with very few and small level spots,\r\nand no absolute precipice; from their flanks project innumerable little\r\nspurs, occupied by native clearings.\r\n\r\nMy route lay along the east flank, overhanging the valley of the Rungmo\r\nriver. Looking east, the amphitheatre of hills from the ridge I had\r\ncrossed was very fine; enclosing an area some four miles across and\r\n4000 feet deep, clothed throughout with an impenetrable, dark forest:\r\nthere was not one clear patch except near the very bottom, where were\r\nsome scattered hamlets of two or three huts each. The rock is\r\neverywhere near the surface, and the road has been formed by blasting\r\nat very many places. A wooded slope descends suddenly from the edge of\r\nthe road, while, on the other hand, a bank rises abruptly to the top of\r\nthe ridge, alternately mossy, rocky, and clayey, and presenting a good\r\ngeological section, all the way along, of the nucleus of Dorjiling\r\nspur, exposing broken masses of gneiss. As I descended, I came upon the\r\nupper limit of the chesnut, a tree second in abundance to the oak;\r\ngigantic, tall, and straight in the trunk.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Dorjiling on the 16th of April; a showery, cold month at\r\nthis elevation. I was so fortunate as to find Mr. Charles Barnes\r\n(brother of my friend at Colgong), the sole tenant of a long,\r\ncottage-like building, divided off into pairs of apartments, which are\r\nhired by visitors. It is usual for Europeans to bring a full\r\nestablishment of servants (with bedding, etc.) to such stations, but I\r\nhad not done so, having been told that there was a furnished hotel in\r\nDorjiling; and I was, therefore, not a little indebted to Mr. Barnes\r\nfor his kind invitation to join his mess. As he was an active\r\nmountaineer, we enjoyed many excursions together, in the two months and\r\na half during which we were companions.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell procured me several active native (Lepcha) lads as\r\ncollectors, at wages varying from eight to twenty shillings a month;\r\nthese either accompanied me on my excursions, or went by themselves\r\ninto the jungles to collect plants, which I occupied myself in drawing,\r\ndissecting, and ticketing: while the preserving of them fell to the\r\nLepchas, who, after a little training, became, with constant\r\nsuperintendence, good plant-driers. Even at this season (four weeks\r\nbefore the setting in of the rains) the weather was very uncertain, so\r\nthat the papers had generally to be dried by the fire.\r\n\r\nThe hill-station or Sanatarium of Dorjiling owes its origin (like\r\nSimla, Mussooree, etc.) to the necessity that exists in India, of\r\nproviding places where the health of Europeans may be recruited by a\r\nmore temperate climate. Sikkim proved an eligible position for such an\r\nestablishment, owing to its proximity to Calcutta, which lies but 370\r\nmiles to the southward; whereas the north-west stations mentioned above\r\nare upwards of a thousand miles from that city. Dorjiling ridge varies\r\nin height from 6,500 to 7,500 feet above the level of the sea; 8000\r\nfeet being the elevation at which the mean temperature most nearly\r\ncoincides with that of London, viz., 50°.\r\n\r\nSikkim was, further, the only available spot for a Sanatarium\r\nthroughout the whole range of the Himalaya, east of the extreme western\r\nfrontier of Nepal; being a protected state, and owing no allegiance,\r\nexcept to the British government; which, after the Rajah had been\r\ndriven from the country by the Ghorkas, in 1817, replaced him on his\r\nthrone, and guaranteed him the sovereignty. Our main object in doing\r\nthis was to retain Sikkim as a fender between Nepal and Bhotan: and but\r\nfor this policy, the aggressive Nepalese would, long ere this, have\r\npossessed themselves of Sikkim, Bhotan, and the whole Himalaya,\r\neastwards to the borders of Burmah.[31]\r\n\r\n [31] Of such being their wish the Nepalese have never made any secret,\r\n and they are said to have asked permission from the British to march\r\n an army across Sikkim for the purpose of conquering Bhotan, offering\r\n to become more peaceable neighbours to us than the Bhotanese are. Such\r\n they would doubtless have proved, but the Nepal frontier is considered\r\n broad enough already.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1817 to 1828 no notice was taken of Sikkim, till a frontier\r\ndispute occurred between the Lepchas and Nepalese, which was referred\r\n(according to the terms of the treaty) to the British Government.\r\nDuring the arrangement of this, Dorjiling was visited by a gentleman of\r\nhigh scientific attainments, Mr. J. W. Grant, who pointed out its\r\neligibility as a site for a Sanatarium to Lord William Bentinck, then\r\nGovernor-General; dwelling especially upon its climate, proximity to\r\nCalcutta, and accessibility; on its central position between Tibet,\r\nBhotan, Nepal, and British India; and on the good example a\r\npeaceably-conducted and well-governed station would be to our turbulent\r\nneighbours in that quarter. The suggestion was cordially received, and\r\nMajor Herbert (the late eminent Surveyor-General of India) and Mr.\r\nGrant were employed to report further on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe next step taken was that of requesting the Rajah to cede a tract of\r\ncountry which should include Dorjiling, for an equivalent in money or\r\nland. His first demand was unreasonable; but on further consideration\r\nhe surrendered Dorjiling unconditionally, and a sum of 300 pounds per\r\nannum was granted to him as an equivalent for what was then a worthless\r\nuninhabited mountain. In 1840 Dr. Campbell was removed from Nepal as\r\nsuperintendent of the new station, and was entrusted with the charge of\r\nthe political relations between the British and Sikkim government.\r\n\r\nOnce established, Dorjiling rapidly increased. Allotments of land were\r\npurchased by Europeans for building dwelling-houses; barracks and a\r\nbazaar were formed, with accommodation for invalid European soldiers; a\r\nfew official residents, civil and military, formed the nucleus of a\r\ncommunity, which was increased by retired officers and their families,\r\nand by temporary visitors in search of health, or the luxury of a cool\r\nclimate and active exercise.\r\n\r\nFor the first few years matters went on smoothly with the Rajah, whose\r\nminister (or Dewan) was upright and intelligent: but the latter, on his\r\ndeath, was succeeded by the present Dewan, a Tibetan, and a relative of\r\nthe Ranee (or Rajah’s wife); a man unsurpassed for insolence and\r\navarice, whose aim was to monopolise the trade of the country, and to\r\nenrich himself at its expense. Every obstacle was thrown by him in the\r\nway of a good understanding between Sikkim and the British government.\r\nBritish subjects were rigorously excluded from Sikkim; every liberal\r\noffer for free trade and intercourse was rejected, generally with\r\ninsolence; merchandise was taxed, and notorious offenders, refugees\r\nfrom the British territories, were harboured; despatches were detained;\r\nand the Vakeels, or Rajah’s representatives, were chosen for their\r\ninsolence and incapacity. The conduct of the Dewan throughout was\r\nIndo-Chinese; assuming, insolent, aggressive, never perpetrating open\r\nviolence, but by petty insults effectually preventing all good\r\nunderstanding. He was met by neglect or forbearance on the part of the\r\nCalcutta government; and by patience and passive resistance at\r\nDorjiling. Our inaction and long-suffering were taken for weakness, and\r\nour concessions for timidity. Such has been our policy in China, Siam,\r\nand Burmah, and in each instance the result has been the same. Had it\r\nbeen insisted that the terms of the treaty should be strictly kept, and\r\nhad the first act of insolence been noticed, we should have maintained\r\nthe best relations with Sikkim, whose people and rulers (with the\r\nexception of the Dewan and his faction) have proved themselves friendly\r\nthroughout, and most anxious for unrestricted communication.\r\n\r\nThese political matters have not, however, prevented the rapid increase\r\nof Dorjiling; the progress of which, during the two years I spent in\r\nSikkim, resembled that of an Australian colony, not only in amount of\r\nbuilding, but in the accession of native families from the surrounding\r\ncountries. There were not a hundred inhabitants under British\r\nprotection when the ground was transferred; there are now four\r\nthousand. At the former period there was no trade whatever; there is\r\nnow a very considerable one, in musk, salt, gold-dust, borax, soda,\r\nwoollen cloths, and especially in poneys, of which the Dewan in one\r\nyear brought on his own account upwards of 50 into Dorjiling.[32] The\r\ntrade has been greatly increased by the annual fair which Dr. Campbell\r\nhas established at the foot of the hills, to which many thousands of\r\nnatives flock from all quarters, and which exercises a most beneficial\r\ninfluence throughout the neighbouring territories. At this, prizes (in\r\nmedals, money, and kind) are given for agricultural implements and\r\nproduce, stock, etc., by the originator and a few friends; a measure\r\nattended with eminent success.\r\n\r\n [32] The Tibetan pony, though born and bred 10,000 to 14,000 feet\r\n above the sea, is one of the most active and useful animals in the\r\n plains of Bengal, powerful and hardy, and when well trained early,\r\n docile, although by nature vicious and obstinate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn estimating in a sanitory point of view the value of any\r\nhealth-station, little reliance can be placed on the general\r\nimpressions of invalids, or even of residents; the opinion of each\r\nvaries with the nature and state of his complaint, if ill, or with his\r\nidiosyncracy and disposition, if well. I have seen prejudiced invalids\r\nrapidly recovering, in spite of themselves, and all the while\r\ncomplaining in unmeasured terms of the climate of Dorjiling, and\r\nabusing it as killing them. Others are known who languish under the\r\nheat of the plains at one season, and the damp at another; and who,\r\nthough sickening and dying under its influence, yet consistently praise\r\na tropical climate to the last. The opinions of those who resort to\r\nDorjiling in health, differ equally; those of active minds invariably\r\nthoroughly enjoy it, while the mere lounger or sportsman mopes. The\r\nstatistical tables afford conclusive proofs of the value of the climate\r\nto Europeans suffering from acute diseases, and they are corroborated\r\nby the returns of the medical officer in charge of the station. With\r\nrespect to its suitability to the European constitution I feel\r\nsatisfied, and that much saving of life, health, and money would be\r\neffected were European troops drafted thither on their arrival in\r\nBengal, instead of being stationed in Calcutta, exposed to disease, and\r\ntemptation to those vices which prove fatal to so many hundreds. This,\r\nI have been given to understand, was the view originally taken by the\r\nCourt of Directors, but it has never been carried out.\r\n\r\nI believe that children’s faces afford as good an index as any to the\r\nhealthfulness of a climate, and in no part of the world is there a more\r\nactive, rosy, and bright young community, than at Dorjiling. It is\r\nincredible what a few weeks of that mountain air does for the\r\nIndia-born children of European parents: they are taken there sickly,\r\npallid or yellow, soft and flabby, to become transformed into models of\r\nrude health and activity.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, disorders to which the climate (in common with all\r\ndamp ones) is not at all suited; such are especially dysentery, bowel\r\ncomplaints, and liver complaints of long standing; which are not\r\nbenefited by a residence on these hills, though how much worse they\r\nmight have become in the plains is not shown. I cannot hear that the\r\nclimate aggravates, but it certainly does not remove them. Whoever is\r\nsuffering from the debilitating effects of any of the multifarious\r\nacute maladies of the plains, finds instant relief, and acquires a\r\nstock of health that enables him to resist fresh attacks, under\r\ncircumstances similar to those which before engendered them.\r\n\r\nNatives of the low country, and especially Bengalees, are far from\r\nenjoying the climate as Europeans do, being liable to sharp attacks of\r\nfever and ague, from which the poorly clad natives are not exempt. It\r\nis, however, difficult to estimate the effects of exposure upon the\r\nBengalees, who sleep on the bare and often damp ground, and adhere,\r\nwith characteristic prejudice, to the attire of a torrid climate, and\r\nto a vegetable diet, under skies to which these are least of all\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Europeans who have resided in the plains\r\ncan, on their first arrival, expose themselves with impunity to the\r\ncold of these elevations; this was shown in the winter of 1848 and\r\n1849, when troops brought up to Dorjiling were cantoned in newly-built\r\ndwellings, on a high exposed ridge 8000 feet above the sea, and lay,\r\ninsufficiently protected, on a floor of loosely laid planks, exposed to\r\nthe cold wind, when the ground without was covered with snow.\r\nRheumatisms, sharp febrile attacks, and dysenteries ensued, which were\r\nattributed in the public prints to the unhealthy nature of the climate\r\nof Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nThe following summary of hospital admissions affords the best test of\r\nthe healthiness of the climate, embracing, as the period does, the\r\nthree most fatal months to European troops in India. Out of a\r\ndetachment (105 strong) of H.M. 80th Regiment stationed at Dorjiling,\r\nin the seven months from January to July inclusive, there were\r\nsixty-four admissions to the hospital, or, on the average, 4-1/3 per\r\ncent. per month; and only two deaths, both of dysentery. Many of these\r\nmen had suffered frequently in the plains from acute dysentery and\r\nhepatic affections, and many others had aggravated these complaints by\r\nexcessive drinking, and two were cases of delirium tremens. During the\r\nsame period, the number of entries at Calcutta or Dinapore would\r\nprobably have more than trebled this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nView from Mr. Hodgson’s of range of snowy mountains—Their extent and\r\nelevation—Delusive appearance of elevation—Sinchul, view from and\r\nvegetation of—Chumulari—Magnolias, white and purple—Rhododendron\r\nDalhousiæ, arboreum and argenteum—Natives of Dorjiling—Lepchas, origin,\r\ntradition of flood, morals, dress, arms, ornaments, diet—cups, origin\r\nand value—Marriages—Diseases—Burial—Worship and religion—Bijooas—Kampa\r\nRong, or Arratt—Limboos, origin, habits, language,\r\netc.—Moormis—Magras—Mechis—Comparison of customs with those of the\r\nnatives of Assam, Khasia, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer, or rainy season of 1848, was passed at or near Dorjiling,\r\nduring which period I chiefly occupied myself in forming collections,\r\nand in taking meteorological observations. I resided at Mr Hodgson’s\r\nfor the greater part of the time, in consequence of his having given me\r\na hospitable invitation to consider his house my home. The view from\r\nhis windows is one quite unparalleled for the scenery it embraces,\r\ncommanding confessedly the grandest known landscape of snowy mountains\r\nin the Himalaya, and hence in the world.[33] Kinchinjunga (forty-five\r\nmiles distant) is the prominent object, rising 21,000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the observer out of a sea of intervening wooded hills; whilst,\r\non a line with its snows, the eye descends below the horizon, to a\r\nnarrow gulf 7000 feet deep in the mountains, where the Great Rungeet,\r\nwhite with foam, threads a tropical forest with a silver line.\r\n\r\n [33] For an account of the geography of these regions, and the\r\n relation of the Sikkim Himalaya to Tibet, etc., see Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the north-west towards Nepal, the snowy peaks of Kubra and Junnoo\r\n(respectively 24,005 feet and 25,312 feet) rise over the shoulder of\r\nSingalelah; whilst eastward the snowy mountains appear to form an\r\nunbroken range, trending north-east to the great mass of Donkia (23,176\r\nfeet) and thence south-east by the fingered peaks of Tunkola and the\r\nsilver cone of Chola, (17,320 feet) gradually sinking into the Bhotan\r\nmountains at Gipmoochi (14,509 feet). The most eloquent descriptions I\r\nhave read fail to convey to my mind’s eye the forms and colours of\r\nsnowy mountains, or to my imagination the sensations and impressions\r\nthat rivet my attention to these sublime phenomena when they are\r\npresent in reality; and I shall not therefore obtrude any attempt of\r\nthe kind upon my reader. The latter has probably seen the Swiss Alps,\r\nwhich, though barely possessing half the sublimity, extent, or height\r\nof the Himalaya, are yet far more beautiful. In either case he is\r\nstruck with the precision and sharpness of their outlines, and still\r\nmore with the wonderful play of colours on their snowy flanks, from the\r\nglowing hues reflected in orange, gold and ruby, from clouds illumined\r\nby the sinking or rising sun, to the ghastly pallor that succeeds with\r\ntwilight, when the red seems to give place to its complementary colour\r\ngreen. Such dissolving-views elude all attempts at description, they\r\nare far too aerial to be chained to the memory, and fade from it so\r\nfast as to be gazed upon day after day, with undiminished admiration\r\nand pleasure, long after the mountains themselves have lost their\r\nsublimity and apparent height.\r\n\r\nThe actual extent of the snowy range seen from Mr. Hodgson’s windows is\r\ncomprised within an arc of 80° (from north 30° west to north 50° east),\r\nor nearly a quarter of the horizon, along which the perpetual snow\r\nforms an unbroken girdle or crest of frosted silver; and in winter,\r\nwhen the mountains are covered down to 8000 feet, this white ridge\r\nstretches uninterruptedly for more than 160°. No known view is to be\r\ncompared with this in extent, when the proximity and height of the\r\nmountains are considered; for within the 80° above mentioned more than\r\ntwelve peaks rise above 20,000 feet, and there are none below 15,000\r\nfeet, while Kinchin is 28,178, and seven others above 22,000. The\r\nnearest perpetual snow is on Nursing, a beautifully sharp conical peak\r\n19,139 feet high, and thirty-two miles distant; the most remote\r\nmountain seen is Donkia, 23,176 feet high, and seventy-three miles\r\ndistant; whilst Kinchin, which forms the principal mass both for height\r\nand bulk, is exactly forty-five miles distant.\r\n\r\nOn first viewing this glorious panorama, the impression produced on the\r\nimagination by their prodigious elevation is, that the peaks tower in\r\nthe air and pierce the clouds, and such are the terms generally used in\r\ndescriptions of similar alpine scenery; but the observer, if he look\r\nagain, will find that even the most stupendous occupy a very low\r\nposition on the horizon, the top of Kinchin itself measuring only 4°\r\n31\" above the level of the observer! Donkia again, which is 23,176 feet\r\nabove the sea, or about 15,700 above Mr. Hodgson’s, rises only 1° 55\"\r\nabove the horizon; an angle which is quite inappreciable to the eye,\r\nwhen unaided by instruments.[34]\r\n\r\n [34] These are the apparent angles which I took from Mr. Hodgson’s\r\n house (alt. 7300 feet) with an excellent theodolite, no deduction\r\n being made for refraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis view may be extended a little by ascending Sinchul, which rises a\r\nthousand feet above the elevation of Mr. Hodgson’s house, and is a few\r\nmiles south-east of Dorjiling: from its summit Chumulari (23,929 feet)\r\nis seen to the north-east, at eighty-four miles distance, rearing its\r\nhead as a great rounded mass over the snowy Chola range, out of which\r\nit appears to rise, although in reality lying forty miles beyond;—so\r\ndeceptive is the perspective of snowy~mountains. To the north-west\r\nagain, at upwards of 100 miles distance, a beautiful group of snowy\r\nmountains rises above the black Singalelah range, the chief being,\r\nperhaps, as high as Kinchinjunga, from which it is fully eighty miles\r\ndistant to the westward; and between them no mountain of considerable\r\naltitude intervenes; the Nepalese Himalaya in that direction sinking\r\nremarkably towards the Arun river, which there enters Nepal from Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe top of Sinchul is a favourite excursion from Dorjiling, being very\r\neasy of access, and the path abounding in rare and beautiful plants,\r\nand passing through magnificent forests of oak, magnolia, and\r\nrhododendron; while the summit, besides embracing this splendid view of\r\nthe snowy range over the Dorjiling spur in the foreground, commands\r\nalso the plains of India, with the courses of the Teesta, Mahanuddee,\r\nBalasun and Mechi rivers. In the months of April and May, when the\r\nmagnolias and rhododendrons are in blossom, the gorgeous vegetation is,\r\nin some respects, not to be surpassed by anything in the tropics; but\r\nthe effect is much marred by the prevailing gloom of the weather. The\r\nwhite-flowered magnolia (_M. excelsa,_ Wall,) forms a predominant tree\r\nat 7000 to 8000 feet; and in 1848 it blossomed so profusely, that the\r\nforests on the broad flanks of Sinchul, and other mountains of that\r\nelevation, appeared as if sprinkled with snow. The purple-flowered kind\r\nagain (_M. Campbellii_) hardly occurs below 8000 feet, and forms an\r\nimmense, but very ugly, black-barked, sparingly branched tree, leafless\r\nin winter and also during the flowering season, when it puts forth from\r\nthe ends of its branches great rose-purple cup-shaped flowers, whose\r\nfleshy petals strew the ground. On its branches, and on those of oaks\r\nand laurels, _Rhododendron Dalhousiæ_ grows epiphytically, a slender\r\nshrub, bearing from three to six white lemon-scented bells, four and a\r\nhalf inches long and as many broad, at the end of each branch. In the\r\nsame woods the scarlet rhododendron (_R. arboreum_) is very scarce, and\r\nis outvied by the great _R. argenteum,_ which grows as a tree forty\r\nfeet high, with magnificent leaves twelve to fifteen inches long, deep\r\ngreen, wrinkled above and silvery below, while the flowers are as large\r\nas those of _R. Dalhousiæ,_ and grow more in a cluster. I know nothing\r\nof the kind that exceeds in beauty the flowering branch of _R.\r\nargenteum,_ with its wide spreading foliage and glorious mass of\r\nflowers. Oaks, laurels, maples, birch, chesnut, hydrangea, a species of\r\nfig (which is found on the very summit), and three Chinese and Japanese\r\ngenera, are the principal features of the forest; the common bushes\r\nbeing _Aucuba, Skimmia,_ and the curious _Helwingia,_ which bears\r\nlittle clusters of flowers on the centre of the leaf, like\r\nbutcher’s-broom. In spring immense broad-leaved arums spring up, with\r\ngreen or purple-striped hoods, that end in tail-like threads, eighteen\r\ninches long, which lie along the ground; and there are various kinds of\r\n_Convallaria, Paris, Begonia,_ and other beautiful flowering herbs.\r\nNearly thirty ferns may be gathered on this excursion, including many\r\nof great beauty and rarity, but the tree-fern does not ascend so high.\r\nGrasses are very rare in these woods, excepting the dwarf bamboo, now\r\ncultivated in the open air in England.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to narrate my different expeditions into Sikkim and\r\nNepal from Dorjiling, I shall give a sketch of the different peoples\r\nand races composing the heterogeneous population of Sikkim and the\r\nneighbouring mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Lepcha is the aboriginal inhabitant of Sikkim, and the prominent\r\ncharacter in Dorjiling, where he undertakes all sorts of out-door\r\nemployment. The race to which he belongs is a very singular one;\r\nmarkedly Mongolian in features, and a good deal too, by imitation, in\r\nhabit; still he differs from his Tibetan prototype, though not so\r\ndecidedly as from the Nepalese and Bhotanese, between whom he is hemmed\r\ninto a narrow tract of mountain country, barely 60 miles in breadth.\r\nThe Lepchas possess a tradition of the flood, during which a couple\r\nescaped to the top of a mountain (Tendong) near Dorjiling. The earliest\r\ntraditions which they have of their history date no further back than\r\nsome three hundred years, when they describe themselves as having been\r\nlong-haired, half-clad savages. At about that period they were visited\r\nby Tibetans, who introduced Boodh worship, the platting of their hair\r\ninto pig-tails, and very many of their own customs. Their physiognomy\r\nis however so Tibetan in its character, that it cannot be supposed that\r\nthis was their earliest intercourse with the trans-nivean races:\r\nwhether they may have wandered from beyond the snows before the spread\r\nof Boodhism and its civilisation, or whether they are a cross between\r\nthe Tamulian of India and the Tibetan, has not been decided. Their\r\nlanguage, though radically identical with Tibetan, differs from it in\r\nmany important particulars. They, or at least some of their tribes,\r\ncall themselves Rong, and Arratt, and their country Dijong: they once\r\npossessed a great part of East Nepal, as far west as the Tambur river,\r\nand at a still earlier period they penetrated as far west as the Arun\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nAn attentive examination of the Lepcha in one respect entirely\r\ncontradicts our preconceived notions of a mountaineer, as he is timid,\r\npeaceful, and no brawler; qualities which are all the more remarkable\r\nfrom contrasting so strongly with those of his neighbours to the east\r\nand west: of whom the Ghorkas are brave and warlike to a proverb, and\r\nthe Bhotanese quarrelsome, cowardly, and cruel. A group of Lepchas is\r\nexceedingly picturesque. They are of short stature—four feet eight\r\ninches to five feet—rather broad in the chest, and with muscular arms,\r\nbut small hands and slender wrists.[35] The face is broad, flat, and of\r\neminently Tartar character, flat-nosed and oblique-eyed, with no beard,\r\nand little moustache; the complexion is sallow, or often a clear olive;\r\nthe hair is collected into an immense tail, plaited flat or round. The\r\nlower limbs are powerfully developed, befitting genuine mountaineers:\r\nthe feet are small. Though never really handsome, and very womanish in\r\nthe cast of countenance, they have invariably a mild, frank, and even\r\nengaging expression, which I have in vain sought to analyse, and which\r\nis perhaps due more to the absence of anything unpleasing, than to the\r\npresence of direct grace or beauty. In like manner, the girls are often\r\nvery engaging to look upon, though without one good feature they are\r\nall smiles and good-nature; and the children are frank, lively,\r\nlaughing urchins. The old women are thorough hags. Indolence, when left\r\nto themselves, is their besetting sin; they detest any fixed\r\nemployment, and their foulness of person and garments renders them\r\ndisagreeable inmates: in this rainy climate they are supportable out of\r\ndoors. Though fond of bathing when they come to a stream in hot\r\nweather, and expert, even admirable swimmers, these people never take\r\nto the water for the purpose of ablution. In disposition they are\r\namiable and obliging, frank, humorous, and polite, without the\r\nservility of the Hindoos; and their address is free and unrestrained.\r\nTheir intercourse with one another and with Europeans is scrupulously\r\nhonest; a present is divided equally amongst many, without a syllable\r\nof discontent or grudging look or word: each, on receiving his share,\r\ncoming up and giving the donor a brusque bow and thanks. They have\r\nlearnt to overcharge already, and use extortion in dealing, as is the\r\ncustom with the people of the plains; but it is clumsily done, and\r\nnever accompanied with the grasping air and insufferable whine of the\r\nlatter. They are constantly armed with a long, heavy, straight\r\nknife,[36] but never draw it on one another: family and political feuds\r\nare alike unheard of amongst them.\r\n\r\n [35] I have seldom been able to insert my own wrist (which is smaller\r\n than the average) into the wooden guard which the Lepcha wears on his\r\n left, as a protection against the bow-string: it is a curved ring of\r\n wood with an opening at one side, through which, by a little\r\n stretching, the wrist is inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n [36] It is called “Ban,” and serves equally for plough, toothpick,\r\n table-knife, hatchet, hammer, and sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lepcha girl and Bhoodist Lama]\r\n\r\nThe Lepcha is in morals far superior to his Tibet and Bhotan\r\nneighbours, polyandry being unknown, and polygamy rare. This is no\r\ndoubt greatly due to the conventual system not being carried to such an\r\nexcess as in Bhotan, where the ties of relationship even are\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nLike the New Zealander, Tasmanian, Fuegian, and natives of other\r\nclimates, which, though cold, are moist and equable, the Lepcha’s dress\r\nis very scanty, and when we are wearing woollen under-garments and\r\nhose, he is content with one cotton vesture, which is loosely thrown\r\nround the body, leaving one or both arms free; it reaches to the knee,\r\nand is gathered round the waist: its fabric is close, the ground colour\r\nwhite, ornamented with longitudinal blue stripes, two or three fingers\r\nbroad, prettily worked with red and white. When new and clean, this\r\ngarb is remarkably handsome and gay, but not showy. In cold weather an\r\nupper garment with loose sleeves is added. A long knife, with a common\r\nwooden handle, hangs by the side, stuck in a sheath; he has often also\r\na quiver of poisoned arrows and a bamboo[37] bow across his back. On\r\nhis right wrist is a curious wooden guard for the bowstring; and a\r\nlittle pouch, containing aconite poison and a few common implements, is\r\nsuspended to his girdle. A hat he seldom wears, and when he does, it is\r\noften extravagantly broad and flat-brimmed, with a small hemispherical\r\ncrown. It is made of leaves of _Scitamineæ,_ between two thin plates of\r\nbamboo-work, clumsy and heavy; this is generally used in the rainy\r\nweather, while in the dry a conical one is worn, also of platted slips\r\nof bamboo, with broad flakes of talc between the layers, and a\r\npeacock’s feather at the side. The umbrella consists of a large hood,\r\nmuch like the ancient boat called a coracle, which being placed over\r\nthe head reaches to the thighs behind. It is made of platted bamboo,\r\nenclosing broad leaves of _Phrynium._ A group of Lepchas with these on,\r\nrunning along in the pelting rain, are very droll figures; they look\r\nlike snails with their shells on their backs. All the Lepchas are fond\r\nof ornaments, wearing silver hoops in their ears, necklaces made of\r\ncornelian, amber, and turquoise, brought from Tibet, and pearls and\r\ncorals from the south, with curious silver and golden charm-boxes or\r\namulets attached to their necks or arms. These are of Tibetan\r\nworkmanship, and often of great value: they contain little idols,\r\ncharms and written prayers, or the bones, hair, or nail-parings of a\r\nLama: some are of great beauty, and highly ornamented. In these\r\ndecorations, and in their hair, they take some pride, the ladies\r\nfrequently dressing the latter for the gentlemen: thus one may often\r\nsee, the last thing at night, a damsel of discreet port, demurely go\r\nbehind a young man, unplait his pig-tail, teaze the hair, thin it of\r\nsome of its lively inmates, braid it up for him, and retire. The women\r\nalways wear two braided pig-tails, and it is by this they are most\r\nreadily distinguished from their effeminate-looking partners, who wear\r\nonly one.[38] When in full dress, the woman’s costume is extremely\r\nornamental and picturesque; besides the shirt and petticoat she wears a\r\nsmall sleeveless woollen cloak, of gay pattern, usually covered with\r\ncrosses, and fastened in front by a girdle of silver chains. Her neck\r\nis loaded with silver chains, amber necklaces, etc., and her head\r\nadorned with a coronet of scarlet cloth, studded with seed-pearls,\r\njewels, glass beads, etc. The common dress is a long robe of indi, a\r\ncloth of coarse silk, spun from the cocoon of a large caterpillar that\r\nis found wild at the foot of the hills, and is also cultivated: it\r\nfeeds on many different leaves, Sal (_Shorea_), castor-oil, etc.\r\n\r\n [37] The bamboo, of which the quiver is made, is thin and light: it is\r\n brought from Assam, and called Tulda, or Dulwa, by the Bengalees.\r\n\r\n\r\n [38] Ermann (Travels in Siberia, ii. p. 204) mentions the Buraet women\r\n as wearing two tails, and fillets with jewels, and the men as having\r\n one queue only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn diet, they are gross feeders;[39] rice, however, forming their chief\r\nsustenance; it is grown without irrigation, and produces a large, flat,\r\ncoarse grain, which becomes gelatinous, and often pink, when cooked.\r\nPork is a staple dish: and they also eat elephant, and all kinds of\r\nanimal food. When travelling, they live on whatever they can find,\r\nwhether animal or vegetable. Fern-tops, roots of _Scitamineæ,_ and\r\ntheir flower-buds, various leaves (it is difficult to say what not),\r\nand fungi, are chopped up, fried with a little oil, and eaten. Their\r\ncooking is coarse and dirty. Salt is costly, but prized; pawn (Betel\r\npepper) is never eaten. Tobacco they are too poor to buy, and too\r\nindolent to grow and cure. Spices, oil, etc. are relished.\r\n\r\n [39] Dr. Campbell’s definition of the Lepcha’s _Flora cibaria,_ is,\r\n that he eats, or must have eaten, everything soft enough to chew; for,\r\n as he knows whatever is poisonous, he must have tried all; his\r\n knowledge being wholly empirical.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey drink out of little wooden cups, turned from knots of maple, or\r\nother woods; these are very curious on several accounts; they are very\r\npretty, often polished, and mounted with silver. Some are supposed to\r\nbe antidotes against poison, and hence fetch an enormous price; they\r\nare of a peculiar wood, rarer and paler-coloured. I have paid a guinea\r\nfor one such, hardly different from the common sort, which cost but\r\n4_d._ or 6_d._ MM. Huc and Gabet graphically allude to this\r\ncircumstance, when wishing to purchase cups at Lhassa, where their\r\nprice is higher, as they are all imported from the Himalaya. The knots\r\nfrom which they are formed, are produced on the roots of oaks, maples,\r\nand other mountain forest trees, by a parasitical plant, known to\r\nbotanists, as _Balanophora._\r\n\r\nTheir intoxicating drink, which seems more to excite than to debauch\r\nthe mind, is partially fermented. Murwa grain (_Eleusine Coracana_).\r\nSpirits are rather too strong to be relished raw, and when a glass of\r\nwine is given to one of a party, he sips it, and hands it round to all\r\nthe rest. A long bamboo flute, with four or six burnt holes far below\r\nthe month-hole, is the only musical instrument I have seen in use among\r\nthem. When travelling, and the fatigues of the day are over, the\r\nLepchas will sit for hours chatting, telling stories, singing in a\r\nmonotonous tone, or blowing this flute. I have often listened with real\r\npleasure to the simple music of this rude instrument; its low and sweet\r\ntones are singularly Æolian, as are the airs usually played, which fall\r\nby octaves: it seems to harmonize with the solitude of their primæval\r\nforests, and he must have a dull ear who cannot draw from it the\r\nindication of a contented mind, whether he may relish its soft musical\r\nnotes or not. Though always equipped for the chase, I fancy the Lepcha\r\nis no great sportsman; there is little to be pursued in this region,\r\nand he is not driven by necessity to follow what there is.\r\n\r\nTheir marriages are contracted in childhood, and the wife purchased by\r\nmoney, or by service rendered to the future father-in-law, the parties\r\nbeing often united before the woman leaves her parents’ roof, in cases\r\nwhere the payment is not forthcoming, and the bridegroom prefers giving\r\nhis and his wife’s labour to the father for a stated period in lieu. On\r\nthe time of service expiring, or the money being paid up, the marriage\r\nis publicly celebrated by feasting and riot. The females are generally\r\nchaste, and the marriage-tie is strictly kept, its violation being\r\nheavily punished by divorce, beating, slavery, etc. In cases of\r\nintermarriage with foreigners, the children belong to the father’s\r\ncountry. All the labours of the house, the field, and march, devolve on\r\nthe women and children, or slaves if they have them.\r\n\r\nSmall-pox is dreaded, and infected persons often cruelly shunned: a\r\nsuspicion of this or of cholera frequently emptying a village or town\r\nin a night. Vaccination has been introduced by Dr. Pearson, and it is\r\nmuch practised by Dr. Campbell; it being eagerly sought. Cholera is\r\nscarcely known at Dorjiling, and when it has been imported thither has\r\nnever spread. Disease is very rare amongst the Lepchas; and ophthalmic,\r\nelephantiasis, and leprosy, the scourges of hot climates, are rarely\r\nknown. Goitre prevails,[40] though not so conspicuously as amongst.\r\nBhoteeas, Bhotanese, and others. Rheumatism is frequent, and\r\nintermittent fevers, with ague; also violent and often fatal\r\nremittents, almost invariably induced by sleeping in the hot valleys,\r\nespecially at the beginning and end of the rains. The European\r\ncomplaints of liver and bowel disease are all but unknown. Death is\r\nregarded with horror. The dead are burnt or buried, sometimes both;\r\nmuch depending on custom and position. Omens are sought in the entrails\r\nof fowls, etc., and other vestiges of their savage origin are still\r\npreserved, though now gradually disappearing.\r\n\r\n [40] oulder-strap in carrying loads be a predisposing cause of goitre,\r\n by inducing congestion of the laryngeal vessels? The Lepcha is\r\n certainly far more free from this disease than any of the tribes of E.\r\n Nepal I have mixed with, and he is both more idle and less addicted to\r\n the head-strap as a porter. I have seen it to be almost universal in\r\n some villages of Bhoteeas, where the head-strap alone is used in\r\n carrying in both summer and winter crops; as also amongst the\r\n salt-traders, or rather those families who carry the salt from the\r\n passes to the Nepalese villages, and who very frequently have no\r\n shoulder-straps, but invariably head-bands. I am far from attributing\r\n all goitre, even in the mountains, to this practice, but I think it is\r\n proved, that the disease is most prevalent in the mountainous regions\r\n of both the old and new world, and that in these the practice of\r\n supporting enormous loads by the cervical muscles is frequent. It is\r\n also found in the Himalayan sheep and goats which accompany the\r\n salt-traders, and whose loads are supported in ascending, by a band\r\n passing under the throat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lepchas profess no religion, though acknowledging the existence of\r\ngood and bad spirits. To the good they pay no heed; “Why should we?”\r\nthey say, “the good spirits do us no harm; the evil spirits, who dwell\r\nin every rock, grove, and mountain, are constantly at mischief, and to\r\nthem we must pray, for they hurt us.” Every tribe has a priest-doctor;\r\nhe neither knows nor attempts to practise the healing art, but is a\r\npure exorcist; all bodily ailments being deemed the operations of\r\ndevils, who are cast out by prayers and invocations. Still they\r\nacknowledge the Lamas to be very holy men, and were the latter only\r\nmoderately active, they would soon convert all the Lepchas. Their\r\npriests are called “Bijooas”: they profess mendicancy, and seem\r\nintermediate between the begging friars of Tibet, whose dress and\r\nattributes they assume, and the exorcists of the aboriginal Lepchas:\r\nthey sing, dance (masked and draped like harlequins), beg, bless,\r\ncurse, and are merry mountebanks; those that affect more of the Lama\r\nBoodhist carry the “Mani,” or revolving praying machine, and wear\r\nrosaries and amulets; others again are all tatters and rags. They are\r\noften employed to carry messages, and to transact little knaveries. The\r\nnatives stand in some awe of them, and being besides of a generous\r\ndisposition, keep the wallet of the Bijooa always full.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the prominent features of this people, who inhabit the\r\nsub-Himalayas, between the Nepalese and Bhotan frontiers, at elevations\r\nof 3000 to 6000 feet. In their relations with us, they are conspicuous\r\nfor their honesty, their power as carriers and mountaineers, and their\r\nskill as woodsmen; for they build a waterproof house with a thatch of\r\nbanana leaves in the lower, or of bamboo in the elevated regions, and\r\nequip it with a table and bedsteads for three persons, in an hour,\r\nusing no implement but their heavy knife. Kindness and good humour soon\r\nattach them to your person and service. A gloomy-tempered or morose\r\nmaster they avoid, an unkind one they flee. If they serve a good\r\nhills-man like themselves, they will follow him with alacrity, sleep on\r\nthe cold, bleak mountain exposed to the pitiless rain, without a\r\nmurmur, lay down the heavy burden to carry their master over a stream,\r\nor give him a helping hand up a rock or precipice—do anything, in\r\nshort, but encounter a foe, for I believe the Lepcha to be a veritable\r\ncoward.[41] It is well, perhaps, he is so: for if a race, numerically\r\nso weak, were to embroil itself by resenting the injuries of the\r\nwarlike Ghorkas, or dark Bhotanese, the folly would soon lead to\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n [41] Yet, during the Ghorka war, they displayed many instances of\r\n courage: when so hard pressed, however, that there was little choice\r\n of evils.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Lepchas, it may be worth mentioning that the\r\nnorthern parts of the country, towards the Tibet frontier, are\r\ninhabited by Sikkim Bhoteeas[42] (or Kumpas), a mixed race calling\r\nthemselves Kumpa Rong, or Kumpa Lepchas; but they are emigrants from\r\nTibet, having come with the first rajah of Sikkim. These people are\r\nmore turbulent and bolder than the Lepchas, and retain much of their\r\nTibetan character, and even of that of the very province from which\r\nthey came; which is north-east of Lhassa, and inhabited by robbers. All\r\nthe accounts I have received of it agree with those given by MM. Huc\r\nand Gabet.\r\n\r\n [42] Bhote is the general name for Tibet (not Bhotan), and Kumpa is a\r\n large province, or district, in that country. The Bhotanese, natives\r\n of Bhotan, or of the Dhurma country, are called Dhurma people, in\r\n allusion to their spiritual chief, the Dhurma Rajah. They are a darker\r\n and more powerful race, rude, turbulent, and Tibetan in language and\r\n religion, with the worst features of those people exaggerated. The\r\n various races of Nepal are too numerous to be alluded to here: they\r\n are all described in various papers by Mr. Hodgson, in the “Journal of\r\n the Asiatic Society of Bengal.” The Dhurma people are numerous at\r\n Dorjiling; they are often runaways, but invariably prove more\r\n industrious settlers than the Lepchas. In the Himalaya the name Bhotan\r\n is unknown amongst the Tibetans; it signifies literally (according to\r\n Mr. Hodgson) the end of Bhote, or Tibet, being the eastern extreme of\r\n that country. The Lepchas designate Bhotan as Ayeu, or Aieu, as do\r\n often the Bhotanese themselves. Sikkim, again, is called Lhop, or\r\n Lho’, by the Lepchas and Bhotanese.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the Lepchas, the most numerous tribe in Sikkim is that of the\r\nLimboos (called “Chung” by the Lepchas); they abound also in East\r\nNepal, which they once ruled, inhabiting elevations from 2000 feet to\r\n5000 feet. They are Boodhists, and though not divided into castes,\r\nbelong to several tribes. All consider themselves as the earliest\r\ninhabitants of the Tambur Valley, though they have a tradition of\r\nhaving originally emigrated from Tibet, which their Tartar countenance\r\nconfirms. They are more slender and sinewy than the Lepchas, and\r\nneither plait their hair nor wear ornaments; instead of the ban they\r\nuse the Nepal curved knife, called “cookree,” while for the striped\r\nkirtle of the Lepcha are substituted loose cotton trousers and a tight\r\njacket; a sash is worn round the middle, and on the head a small cotton\r\ncap. When they ruled over East Nepal, their system was feudal; and on\r\ntheir uniting against the Nepalese, they were with difficulty dislodged\r\nfrom their strongholds. They are said to be equally brave and cruel in\r\nbattle, putting the old and weak to the sword, carrying the younger to\r\nslavery, and killing on the march such captives as are unable to\r\nproceed. Many enlist at Dorjiling, which the Lepchas never do; and the\r\nrajah of Nepal employs them in his army, where, however, they seldom\r\nobtain promotion, this being reserved for soldiers of Hindoo tribes.\r\nLatterly Jung Bahadur levied a force of 6000 of them, who were cantoned\r\nat Katmandoo, where the cholera breaking out, carried off some\r\nhundreds, causing many families who dreaded conscription to flock to\r\nDorjiling. Their habits are so similar to those of the Lepchas, that\r\nthey constantly intermarry. They mourn, burn, and bury their dead,\r\nraising a mound over the corpse, erecting a headstone, and surrounding\r\nthe grave with a little paling of sticks; they then scatter eggs and\r\npebbles over the ground. In these offices the Bijooa of the Lepchas is\r\nemployed, but the Limboo has also priests of his own, called\r\n“Phedangbos,” who belong to rather a higher order than the Bijooas.\r\nThey officiate at marriages, when a cock is put into the bridegroom’s\r\nhands, and a hen into those of the bride; the Phedangbo then cuts off\r\nthe birds’ heads, when the blood is caught on a plantain leaf, and runs\r\ninto pools from which omens are drawn. At death, guns are fired, to\r\nannounce to the gods the departure of the spirit; of these there are\r\nmany, having one supreme head, and to them offerings and sacrifices are\r\nmade. They do not believe in metempsychosis.\r\n\r\nThe Limboo language is totally different from the Lepcha; with less of\r\nthe _z_ in it, and more labials and palatals, hence more pleasing. Its\r\naffinities I do not know; it has no peculiar written character, the\r\nLepcha or Nagri being used. Dr. Campbell, from whom I have, derived\r\nmost of my information respecting these people, was informed,[43] on\r\ngood authority, that they had once a written language, now lost; and\r\nthat it was compounded from many others by a sage of antiquity. The\r\nsame authority stated that their Lepcha name “Chung” is a corruption of\r\nthat of their place of residence; possibly the “Tsang” province of\r\nTibet.\r\n\r\n [43] See “Dorjiling Guide,” p. 89. Calcutta, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moormis are the only other native tribe remaining in any numbers in\r\nSikkim, except the Tibetans of the loftier mountains (whom I shall\r\nmention at a future period), and the Mechis of the pestilential Terai,\r\nthe forests of which they never leave. The Moormis are a scattered\r\npeople, respecting whom I have no information, except from the\r\nauthority quoted above. They are of Tibetan origin, and called\r\n“Nishung,” from being composed of two branches, respectively from the\r\ndistricts of Nimo and Shung, both on the road between Sikkim and\r\nLhassa. They are now most frequent in central and eastern Nepal, and\r\nare a pastoral and agricultural people, inhabiting elevations of 4000\r\nto 6000 feet, and living in stone houses, thatched with grass. They are\r\na large, powerful, and active race, grave, very plain in features, with\r\nlittle hair on the face. Both their language and religion are purely\r\nTibetan.\r\n\r\nThe Magras, a tribe now confined to Nepal west of the Arun, are\r\naborigines of Sikkim, whence they were driven by the Lepchas westward\r\ninto the country of the Limboos, and by these latter further west\r\nstill. They are said to have been savages, and not of Tibetan origin,\r\nand are now converted to Hindooism. A somewhat mythical account of a\r\nwild people still inhabiting the Sikkim mountains, will be alluded to\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe that these mountains do not appear to have\r\nafforded refuge to the Tamulian[44] aborigines of India proper; all the\r\nHimalayan tribes of Sikkim being markedly Mongolian in origin. It does\r\nnot, however, follow that they are all of Tibetan extraction; perhaps,\r\nindeed, none but the Moormis are so. The Mechi of the Terai is\r\ndecidedly Indo-Chinese, and of the same stock as the savage races of\r\nAssam, the north-east and east frontier of Bengal, Arracan, Burmah,\r\netc. Both Lepchas and Limboos had, before the introduction of Lama\r\nBoodhism from Tibet, many features in common with the natives of\r\nArracan, especially in their creed, sacrifices, faith in omens, worship\r\nof many spirits, absence of idols, and of the doctrine of\r\nmetempsychosis. Some of their customs, too, are the same; the form of\r\ntheir houses and of some of their implements, their striped garments,\r\ntheir constant and, dexterous use of the bamboo for all utensils, their\r\npractice of night-attacks in war, of using poisoned arrows only in the\r\nchase, and that of planting “crow-feet” of sharp bamboo stakes along\r\nthe paths an enemy is expected to follow. Such are but a few out of\r\nmany points of resemblance, most of which struck me when reading\r\nLieutenant Phayre’s account of Arracan,[45] and when travelling in the\r\ndistricts of Khasia and Cachar.\r\n\r\n [44] The Tamulians are the Coles, Dangas, etc., of the mountains of\r\n Central India and the peninsula, who retired to mountain fastnesses,\r\n on the invasion of their country by the Indo-Germanic conquerors, who\r\n are now represented by the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n\r\n [45] “Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laws affecting the distribution of plants, and the lower animals,\r\nmaterially influence the migrations of man also; and as the botany,\r\nzoology, and climate of the Malayan and Siamese peninsula advance far\r\nwestwards into India, along the foot of the Himalaya, so do also the\r\nvarieties of the human race. These features are most conspicuously\r\ndisplayed in the natives of Assam, on both sides of the Burrampooter,\r\nas far as the great bend of that river, beyond which they gradually\r\ndisappear; and none of the Himalayan tribes east of that point practise\r\nthe bloody and brutal rites in war that prevail amongst the Cookies,\r\nKhasias, Garrows, and other Indo-Chinese tribes of the mountain forests\r\nof Assam, Eastern Bengal, and the Malay peninsula.\r\n\r\nI have not alluded to that evidence of the extraction of the Sikkim\r\nraces, which is to be derived from their languages, and from which we\r\nmay hope for a clue to their origin; the subject is at present under\r\ndiscussion, and involved in much obscurity.\r\n\r\nThat six or seven different tribes, without any feudal system or\r\ncoercive head, with different languages and customs, should dwell in\r\nclose proximity and in peace and unity, within the confined territory\r\nof Sikkim, even for a limited period, is an anomaly; the more\r\nespecially when it is considered that except for a tincture of the\r\nBoodhist religion among some few of the people, they are all but\r\nsavages, as low in the scale of intellect as the New Zealander or the\r\nTahitian, and beneath those races in ingenuity and skill as craftsmen.\r\nWars have been waged amongst them, but they were neither sanguinary nor\r\ndestructive, and the fact remains no less remarkable, that at the\r\nperiod of our occupying Dorjiling, friendship and unanimity existed\r\namongst all these tribes; from the Tibetan at 14,000 feet, to the Mechi\r\nof the plains; under a sovereign whose temporal power was wholly\r\nunsupported by even the semblance of arms, and whose spiritual\r\nsupremacy was acknowledged by very few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nExcursion from Dorjiling to Great Rungeet—Zones of\r\nvegetation—Tree-ferns—Palms, upper limit of—Leebong, tea\r\nplantations—Ging—Boodhist remains—Tropical vegetation—Pines—Lepcha\r\nclearances—Forest fires—Boodhist monuments—Fig—Cane bridge and raft\r\nover Rungeet—Sago-palm—India-rubber—Yel Pote—Butterflies and other\r\ninsects—Snakes—Camp—Temperature and humidity of atmosphere—Junction of\r\nTeesta and Rungeet—Return to Dorjiling—Tonglo, excursion to—Bamboo\r\nflowering—Oaks—Gordonia—Maize, hermaphrodite\r\nflowered—Figs—Nettles—Peepsa—Simonbong, cultivation at—European fruits\r\nat Dorjiling—Plains of India.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very favourite and interesting excursion from Dorjiling is to the\r\ncane bridge over the Great Rungeet river, 6000 feet below the station.\r\nTo this an excellent road has been cut, by which the whole descent of\r\nsix miles, as the crow flies, is easily performed on pony-back; the\r\nroad distance being only eleven miles. The scenery is, of course, of a\r\ntotally different description from that of Sinchul, or even of the foot\r\nof the hills, being that of a deep mountain-valley. I several times\r\nmade this trip; on the excursion about to be described, and in which I\r\nwas accompanied by Mr. Barnes, I followed the Great Rungeet to the\r\nTeesta, into which it flows.\r\n\r\nIn descending from Dorjiling, the zones of vegetation are well marked\r\nbetween 6000 and 7000 feet by—1. The oak, chesnut, and Magnolias, the\r\nmain features from 7000 to 10,000 feet.—2. Immediately below 6,500\r\nfeet, the tree-fern appears (_Alsophila gigantea,_ Wall.), a\r\nwidely-distributed plant, common to the Himalaya, from Nepal eastward\r\nto the Malayan peninsula, Java, and Ceylon.—3. Of palms, a species of\r\n_Calamus,_ and _Plectocomia,_ the “Rhenoul” of the Lepchas. The latter,\r\nthough not a very large plant, climbs lofty trees, and extends about 40\r\nyards through the forest; 6,500 feet is the upper limit of palms in the\r\nSikkim Himalaya, the Rhenoul alone attaining this elevation.[46]—4. The\r\nfourth striking feature is a wild plantain, which ascends to nearly the\r\nsame elevation (“Lukhlo,” Lepcha). This is replaced by another, and\r\nrather larger species, at lower elevations; both ripen austere and\r\nsmall fruits, which are full of seeds, and quite uneatable; that\r\ncommonly grown in Sikkim is an introduced stock (nor have the wild\r\nspecies ever been cultivated); it is very large, but poor in flavour,\r\nand does not bear seeds. The zones of these conspicuous plants are very\r\nclearly defined, and especially if the traveller, standing on one of\r\nthe innumerable spurs which project from the Dorjiling ridge, cast his\r\neyes up the gorges of green on either hand.\r\n\r\n [46] Four other _Calami_ range between 1000 and 6000 feet on the outer\r\n hills, some of them being found forty miles distant from the plains of\r\n India. The other palms of Sikkim are, “Simong” (_Caryota urens_); it\r\n is rare, and ascends to nearly 5000 feet. _Phœnix_ (probably _P.\r\n acaulis,_ Buch.), a small, stemless species, which grows on the driest\r\n soil in the deep valleys; it is the “Schaap” of the Lepchas, who eat\r\n the young seeds, and use the feathery fronds as screens in hunting.\r\n _Wallichia oblonjpgolia,_ the “Ooh” of the Lepchas, who make no use of\r\n it; Dr. Campbell and myself, however, found that it is an admirable\r\n fodder for horses, who prefer it to any other green food to be had in\r\n these mountains. _Areca gracilis_ and _Licuala peltata_ are the only\r\n other palms in Sikkim; but _Cycas pectinata,_ with the India-rubber\r\n fig, occurs in the deepest and hottest valleys—the western limit of\r\n both these interesting plants. Of _Pandanus_ there is a graceful\r\n species at elevations of 1000 to 4000 feet (“Borr,” Lepcha).\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 1000 feet below Dorjiling a fine wooded spur projects, called\r\nLeebong. This beautiful spot is fully ten degrees warmer than Mr.\r\nHodgson’s house, and enjoys considerably more sunshine; peaches and\r\nEnglish fruit-trees flourish extremely well, but do not ripen fruit.\r\nThe tea-plant succeeds here admirably, and might be cultivated to great\r\nprofit, and be of advantage in furthering a trade with Tibet. It has\r\nbeen tried on a large scale by Dr. Campbell at his residence (alt. 7000\r\nfeet), but the frosts and snow of that height injure it, as do the\r\nhailstorms in spring.\r\n\r\nBelow Leebong is the village of Ging, surrounded by steeps, cultivated\r\nwith maize, rice, and millet. It is rendered very picturesque by a long\r\nrow of tall poles, each bearing a narrow, vertically elongated banner,\r\ncovered with Boodhist inscriptions, and surmounted by coronet-like\r\nornaments, or spear-heads, rudely cut out of wood, or formed of\r\nbasket-work, and adorned with cotton fringe. Ging is peopled by Bhotan\r\nemigrants, and when one dies, if his relations can afford to pay for\r\nthem, two additional poles and flags are set up by the Lamas in honour\r\nof his memory, and that of Sunga, the third member of the Boodhist\r\nTrinity.\r\n\r\nBelow this the _Gordonia_ commences, with _Cedrela toona,_ and various\r\ntropical genera, such as abound near Punkabaree. The heat and hardness\r\nof the rocks cause the streams to dry up on these abrupt hills,\r\nespecially on the eastern slope, and the water is therefore conveyed\r\nalong the sides of the path, in conduits ingeniously made of bamboo,\r\neither split in half, or, what is better, whole, except at the septum,\r\nwhich is removed through a lateral hole. The oak and chesnut of this\r\nlevel (3000 feet), are both different from those which grow above, as\r\nare the brambles. The _Arums_ are replaced by _Caladiums._ Tree-ferns\r\ncease below 4000 feet, and the large bamboo abounds.\r\n\r\nAt about 2000 feet, and ten miles distant from Dorjiling, we arrived at\r\na low, long spur, dipping down to the bed of the Rungeet, at its\r\njunction with the Rungmo. This is close to the boundary of the British\r\nground, and there is a guard-house, and a sepoy or two at it; here we\r\nhalted. It took the Lepchas about twenty minutes to construct a table\r\nand two bedsteads within our tent; each was made of four forked sticks,\r\nstuck in the ground, supporting as many side-pieces, across which were\r\nlaid flat split pieces of bamboo, bound tightly together by strips of\r\nrattan palm-stem. The beds were afterwards softened by many layers of\r\nbamboo-leaf, and if not very downy, they were dry, and as firm as if\r\nput together with screws and joints. This spur rises out of a deep\r\nvalley, quite surrounded by lofty mountains; it is narrow, and covered\r\nwith red clay, which the natives chew as a cure for goître. North, it\r\nlooks down into a gully, at the bottom of which the Rungeet’s foamy\r\nstream winds through a dense forest. In the opposite direction, the\r\nRungmo comes tearing down from the top of Sinchul, 7000 feet above; and\r\nthough its roar is heard, and its course is visible throughout its\r\nlength, the stream itself is nowhere seen, so deep does it cut its\r\nchannel. Except on this, and a few similarly hard rocky hills around,\r\nthe vegetation is a mass of wood and jungle. At this spot it is rather\r\nscanty and dry, with abundance of the _Pinus lonjpgolia_ and Sal. The\r\ndwarf date-palm (_Phœnix acaulis_) also, was very abundant.\r\n\r\nThe descent to the river was exceedingly steep, the banks presenting an\r\nimpenetrable jungle. The pines on the arid crests of the hills around\r\nformed a remarkable feature: they grow like the Scotch fir, the tall,\r\nred trunks springing from the steep and dry slopes. But little resin\r\nexudes from the stem, which, like that of most pines, is singularly\r\nfree from lichens and mosses; its wood is excellent, and the charcoal\r\nof the burnt leaves is used as a pigment. Being confined to dry soil,\r\nthis pine is local in Sikkim, and the elevation it attains here is not\r\nabove 3000 feet. In Bhotan, where there is more dry country, its range\r\nis about the same, and in the north-west Himalaya, from 2,500 to 7000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe Lepcha never inhabits one spot for more than three successive\r\nyears, after which an increased rent is demanded by the Rajah. He\r\ntherefore _squats_ in any place which he can render profitable for that\r\nperiod, and then moves to another. His first operation, after selecting\r\na site, is to burn the jungle; then he clears away the trees, and\r\ncultivates between the stumps. At this season, firing the jungle is a\r\nfrequent practice, and the effect by night is exceedingly fine; a\r\nforest, so dry and full of bamboo, and extending over such steep hills,\r\naffording grand blazing spectacles. Heavy clouds canopy the mountains\r\nabove, and, stretching across the valleys, shut out the firmament; the\r\nair is a dead calm, as usual in these deep gorges, and the fires,\r\ninvisible by day, are seen raging all around, appearing to an\r\ninexperienced eye in all but dangerous proximity. The voices of birds\r\nand insects being hushed, nothing is audible but the harsh roar of the\r\nrivers, and occasionally, rising far above it, that of the forest\r\nfires. At night we were literally surrounded by them; some smouldering,\r\nlike the shale-heaps at a colliery, others fitfully bursting forth,\r\nwhilst others again stalked along with a steadily increasing and\r\nenlarging flame, shooting out great tongues of fire, which spared\r\nnothing as they advanced with irresistible might. Their triumph is in\r\nreaching a great bamboo clump, when the noise of the flames drowns that\r\nof the torrents, and as the great stem-joints, burst, from the\r\nexpansion of the confined air, the report is as that of a salvo from a\r\npark of artillery. At Dorjiling the blaze is visible, and the deadened\r\nreports of the bamboos bursting is heard throughout the night; but in\r\nthe valley, and within a mile of the scene of destruction, the effect\r\nis the most grand, being heightened by the glare reflected from the\r\nmasses of mist which hover above.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we pursued a path to the bed of the river;\r\npassing a rude Booddhist monument, a pile of slate-rocks, with an\r\nattempt at the mystical hemisphere at top. A few flags or banners, and\r\nslabs of slate, were inscribed with “Om Mani Padmi om.” Placed on a\r\njutting angle of the spur, backed with the pine-clad hills, and flanked\r\nby a torrent on either hand, the spot was wild and picturesque; and I\r\ncould not but gaze with a feeling of deep interest on these emblems of\r\na religion which perhaps numbers more votaries than any other on the\r\nface of the globe. Booddhism in some form is the predominating creed,\r\nfrom Siberia and Kamschatka to Ceylon, from the Caspian steppes to\r\nJapan, throughout China, Burmah, Ava, and a part of the Malayan\r\nArchipelago. Its associations enter into every book of travels over\r\nthese vast regions, with Booddha, Dhurma, Sunga, Jos, Fo, and\r\npraying-wheels. The mind is arrested by the names, the imagination\r\ncaptivated by the symbols; and though I could not worship in the grove,\r\nit was impossible to deny to the inscribed stones such a tribute as is\r\ncommanded by the first glimpse of objects which have long been familiar\r\nto our minds, but not previously offered to our senses. My head Lepcha\r\nwent further: to a due observance of demon-worship he united a deep\r\nreverence for the Lamas, and he venerated their symbols rather as\r\ntheirs than as those of their religion. He walked round the pile of\r\nstones three times from left to right repeating his “Om Mani,” etc.,\r\nthen stood before it with his head hung down and his long queue\r\nstreaming behind, and concluded by a votive offering of three\r\npine-cones. When done, he looked round at me, nodded, smirked, elevated\r\nthe angles of his little turned-up eyes, and seemed to think we were\r\nsafe from all perils in the valleys yet to be explored.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pines (Pinus lonjpgolia), Rungeet Valley]\r\n\r\nIn the gorge of the Rungeet the heat was intolerable, though the\r\nthermometer did not rise above 95°. The mountains leave but a narrow\r\ngorge between them, here and there bordered by a belt of strong soil,\r\nsupporting a towering crop of long cane-like grasses and tall trees.\r\nThe troubled river, about eighty yards across, rages along over a\r\ngravelly bed. Crossing the Rungmo, where it falls into the Rungeet, we\r\ncame upon a group of natives drinking fermented Murwa liquor, under a\r\nrock; I had a good deal of difficulty in getting my people past, and\r\nmore in inducing one of the topers to take the place of a Ghorka\r\n(Nepalese) of our party who was ill with fever. Soon afterwards, at a\r\nmost wild and beautiful spot, I saw, for the first time, one of the\r\nmost characteristic of Himalayan objects of art, _a cane bridge._ All\r\nthe spurs, round the bases of which the river flowed, were steep and\r\nrocky, their flanks clothed with the richest tropical forest, their\r\ncrests tipped with pines. On the river’s edge, the Banana, _Pandanus,_\r\nand _Bauhinia,_ were frequent, and Figs prevailed. One of the latter\r\n(of an exceedingly beautiful species) projected over the stream,\r\ngrowing out of a mass of rock, its roots interlaced and grasping at\r\nevery available support, while its branches, loaded with deep glossy\r\nfoliage, hung over the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Construction of a cane suspension bridge]\r\n\r\nThis tree formed one pier for the canes; that on the opposite bank, was\r\nconstructed of strong piles, propped with large stones; and between\r\nthem swung the bridge,[47] about eighty yards long, ever rocking over\r\nthe torrent (forty feet below). The lightness and extreme simplicity of\r\nits structure were very remarkable. Two parallel canes, on the same\r\nhorizontal plane, were stretched across the stream; from them others\r\nhung in loops, and along the loops were laid one or two bamboo stems\r\nfor flooring; cross pieces below this flooring, hung from the two upper\r\ncanes, which they thus served to keep apart. The traveller grasps one\r\nof the canes in either hand, and walks along the loose bamboos laid on\r\nthe swinging loops: the motion is great, and the rattling of the loose\r\ndry bamboos is neither a musical sound, nor one calculated to inspire\r\nconfidence; the whole structure seeming as if about to break down. With\r\nshoes it is not easy to walk; and even with bare feet it is often\r\ndifficult, there being frequently but one bamboo, which, if the\r\nfastening is loose, tilts up, leaving the pedestrian suspended over the\r\ntorrent by the slender canes. When properly and strongly made, with\r\ngood fastenings, and a floor of bamboos laid _transversely,_ these\r\nbridges are easy to cross. The canes are procured from a species of\r\n_Calamus_; they are as thick as the finger, and twenty, or thirty yards\r\nlong, knotted together; and the other pieces are fastened to them by\r\nstrips of the same plant. A Lepcha, carrying one hundred and forty\r\npounds on his back, crosses without hesitation, slowly but steadily,\r\nand with perfect confidence.\r\n\r\n [47] A sketch of one of these bridges will be found in Vol. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nA deep broad pool below the bridge was made available for a ferry: the\r\nboat was a triangular raft of bamboo stems, with a stage on the top,\r\nand it was secured on the opposite side of the stream, having a cane\r\nreaching across to that on which we were. A stout Lepcha leapt into the\r\nboiling flood, and boldly swam across, holding on by the cane, without\r\nwhich he would have been carried away. He unfastened the raft, and we\r\ndrew it over by the cane, and, seated on the stage, up to our knees in\r\nwater, we were pulled across; the raft bobbing up and down over the\r\nrippling stream.\r\n\r\nWe were beyond British ground, on the opposite bank, where any one\r\nguiding Europeans is threatened with punishment: we had expected a\r\nguide to follow us, but his non-appearance caused us to delay for some\r\nhours; four roads, or rather forest paths, meeting here, all of which\r\nwere difficult to find. After a while, part of a marriage-procession\r\ncame up, headed by the bridegroom, a handsome young Lepcha, leading a\r\ncow for the marriage feast; and after talking to him a little, he\r\nvolunteered to show us the path. On the flats by the stream grew the\r\nSago palm (_Cycas pectinata_), with a stem ten feet high, and a\r\nbeautiful crown of foliage; the contrast between this and the\r\nScotch-looking pine (both growing with oaks and palms) was curious.\r\nMuch of the forest had been burnt, and we traversed large blackened\r\npatches, where the heat was intense, and increased by the burning\r\ntrunks of prostrate trees, which smoulder for months, and leave a heap\r\nof white ashes. The larger timber being hollow in the centre, a current\r\nof air is produced, which causes the interior to burn rapidly, till the\r\nsides fall in, and all is consumed. I was often startled, when walking\r\nin the forest, by the hot blast proceeding from such, which I had\r\napproached without a suspicion of their being other than cold dead\r\ntrunks.\r\n\r\nLeaving the forest, the path led along the river bank, and over the\r\ngreat masses of rock which strewed its course. The beautiful\r\nIndia-rubber fig was common, as was _Bassia butyracea,_ the “Yel Pote”\r\nof the Lepchas, from the seeds of which they express a concrete oil,\r\nwhich is received and hardens in bamboo vessels. On the forest-skirts,\r\n_Hoya,_ parasitical _Orchideæ,_ and Ferns, abounded; the Chaulmoogra,\r\nwhose fruit is used to intoxicate fish, was very common; as was an\r\nimmense mulberry tree, that yields a milky juice and produces a long\r\ngreen sweet fruit. Large fish, chiefly Cyprinoid, were abundant in the\r\nbeautifully clear water of the river. But by far the most striking\r\nfeature consisted in the amazing quantity of superb butterflies, large\r\ntropical swallow-tails, black, with scarlet or yellow eyes on their\r\nwings. They were seen everywhere, sailing majestically through the\r\nstill hot air, or fluttering from one scorching rock to another, and\r\nespecially loving to settle on the damp sand of the river-edge; where\r\nthey sat by thousands, with erect wings, balancing themselves with a\r\nrocking motion, as their heavy sails inclined them to one side or the\r\nother; resembling a crowded fleet of yachts on a calm day. Such an\r\nentomological display cannot be surpassed. _Cicindelæ_ were very\r\nnumerous, and incredibly active, as were _Grylli_; and the great\r\n_Cicadeæ_ were everywhere lighting on the ground, when they uttered a\r\nshort sharp creaking sound, and anon disappeared, as if by magic.\r\nBeautiful whip-snakes were gleaming in the sun: they hold on by a few\r\ncoils of the tail round a twig, the greater part of their body\r\nstretched out horizontally, occasionally retracting, and darting an\r\nunerring aim at some insect. The narrowness of the gorge, and the\r\nexcessive steepness of the bounding hills, prevented any view, except\r\nof the opposite mountain face, which was one dense forest, in which the\r\nwild Banana was conspicuous.\r\n\r\nTowards evening we arrived at another cane-bridge, still more\r\ndilapidated than the former, but similar in structure. For a few\r\nhundred yards before reaching it, we lost the path, and followed the\r\nprecipitous face of slate-rocks overhanging the stream, which dashed\r\nwith great violence below. Though we could not walk comfortably, even\r\nwith our shoes off, the Lepchas, bearing their enormous loads,\r\nproceeded with perfect indifference.\r\n\r\nAnxious to avoid sleeping at the bottom of the valley, we crawled, very\r\nmuch fatigued, through burnt dry forest, up a very sharp ridge, so\r\nnarrow that the tent sat astride on it, the ropes being fastened to the\r\ntops of small trees on either slope. The ground swarmed with black\r\nants, which got into our tea, sugar, etc., while it was so covered with\r\ncharcoal, that we were soon begrimed. Our Lepchas preferred remaining\r\non the river-bank, whence they had to bring up water to us, in great\r\nbamboo “chungis,” as they are called. The great dryness of this face is\r\nowing to its southern exposure: the opposite mountains, equally high\r\nand steep, being clothed in a rich green forest.\r\n\r\nAt nine the next morning, the temperature was 78°, but a fine cool\r\neasterly wind blew. Descending to the bed of the river, the temperature\r\nwas 84°. The difference in humidity of the two stations (with about 300\r\nfeet difference in height) was more remarkable; at the upper, the wet\r\nbulb thermometer was 67·5°, and consequently the saturation point,\r\n0·713; at the lower, the wet bulb was 68°, and saturation, 0·599. The\r\ntemperature of the river was, at all hours of the preceding day, and\r\nthis morning, 67·5°.[48]\r\n\r\n [48] At this hour, the probable temperature at Dorjiling (6000 feet\r\n above this) would be 56°, with a temperature of wet bulb 55°, and the\r\n atmosphere loaded with vapour. At Calcutta, again, the temperature was\r\n at the observatory 98.·3°, wet bulb, 81.8°, and saturation=0·737. The\r\n dryness of the air, in the damper-looking and luxuriant river-bed, was\r\n owing to the heated rocks of its channel; while the humidity of the\r\n atmosphere over the drier-looking hill where we encamped, was due to\r\n the moisture of the wind then blowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur course down the river was by so rugged a path, that, giddy and\r\nfootsore with leaping from rock to rock, we at last attempted the\r\njungle, but it proved utterly impervious. On turning a bend of the\r\nstream, the mountains of Bhotan suddenly presented themselves, with the\r\nTeesta flowing at their base; and we emerged at the angle formed by the\r\njunction of the Rungeet, which we had followed from the west, of the\r\nTeesta, coming from the north, and of their united streams flowing\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nWe were not long before enjoying the water, when I was surprised to\r\nfind that of the Teesta singularly cold; its temperature being 7° below\r\nthat of the Rungeet.[49] At the salient angle (a rocky peninsula) of\r\ntheir junction, we could almost place one foot in the cold stream and\r\nthe other in the warmer. There is a no less marked difference in the\r\ncolour of the two rivers; the Teesta being sea-green and muddy, the\r\nGreat Rungeet dark green and very clear; and the waters, like those of\r\nthe Arve and Rhone at Geneva, preserve their colours for some hundred\r\nyards; the line separating the two being most distinctly drawn. The\r\nTeesta, or main stream, is much the broadest (about 80 or 100 yards\r\nwide at this season), the most rapid and deep. The rocks which skirt\r\nits bank were covered with a silt or mud deposit, which I nowhere\r\nobserved along the Great Rungeet, and which, as well as its colour and\r\ncoldness, was owing to the vast number of then melting glaciers drained\r\nby this river. The Rungeet, on the other hand, though it rises amongst\r\nthe glaciers of Kinchinjunga and its sister peaks, is chiefly supplied\r\nby the rainfall of the outer ranges of Sinchul and Singalelah, and\r\nhence its waters are clear, except during the height of the rains.\r\n\r\n [49] This is, no doubt, due partly to the Teesta flowing south, and\r\n thus having less of the sun, and partly to its draining snowy\r\n mountains throughout a much longer portion of its course. The\r\n temperature of the one was 67·5°, and that of the other 60·5°.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this place we returned to Dorjiling, arriving on the afternoon of\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting trip to be made from Dorjiling, is that to the\r\nsummit of Tonglo, a mountain on the Singalelah range, 10,079 feet high,\r\ndue west of the station, and twelve miles in a straight line, but fully\r\nthirty by the path.[50]\r\n\r\n [50] A full account of the botanical features noticed on this\r\n excursion (which I made in May, 1848, with Mr. Barnes) has appeared in\r\n the “London Journal of Botany,” and the “Horticultural Society’s\r\n Journal,” and I shall, therefore, recapitulate its leading incidents\r\n only.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the station by a native path, the latter plunges at once into a\r\nforest, and descends very rapidly, occasionally emerging on cleared\r\nspurs, where are fine crops of various millets, with much maize and\r\nrice. Of the latter grain as many as eight or ten varieties are\r\ncultivated, but seldom irrigated, which, owing to the dampness of the\r\nclimate, is not necessary: the produce is often eighty-fold, but the\r\ngrain is large, coarse, reddish, and rather gelatinous when boiled.\r\nAfter burning the timber, the top soil is very fertile for several\r\nseasons, abounding in humus, below which is a stratum of stiff clay,\r\noften of great thickness, produced by the disintegration of the\r\nrocks;[51] the clay makes excellent bricks, and often contains nearly\r\n30 per cent. of alumina.\r\n\r\n [51] An analysis of the soil will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about 4000 feet the great bamboo (“Pao” Lepcha) abounds; it flowers\r\nevery year, which is not the case with all others of this genus, most\r\nof which flower profusely over large tracts of country, once in a great\r\nmany years, and then die away; their place being supplied by seedlings,\r\nwhich grow with immense rapidity. This well-known fact is not due, as\r\nsome suppose, to the life of the species being of such a duration, but\r\nto favourable circumstances in the season. The Pao attains a height of\r\n40 to 60 feet, and the culms average in thickness the human thigh; it\r\nis used for large water-vessels, and its leaves form admirable thatch,\r\nin universal use for European houses at Dorjiling. Besides this, the\r\nLepchas are acquainted with nearly a dozen kinds of bamboo; these occur\r\nat various elevations below 12,000 feet, forming, even in the\r\npine-woods, and above their zone, in the skirts of the _Rhododendron_\r\nscrub, a small and sometimes almost impervious jungle. In an economical\r\npoint of view they maybe classed as those which split readily, and\r\nthose which do not. The young shoots of several are eaten, and the\r\nseeds of one are made into a fermented drink, and into bread in times\r\nof scarcity; but it would take many pages to describe the numerous\r\npurposes to which the various species are put.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lepcha water-carrier with a bamboo chungi]\r\n\r\nGordonia is their most common tree (_G. Wallichii_), much prized for\r\nploughshares and other purposes requiring a hard wood: it is the\r\n“Sing-brang-kun” of the Lepchas, and ascends to 4000 feet. Oaks at this\r\nelevation occur as solitary trees, of species different from those of\r\nDorjiling. There are three or four with a cup-shaped involucre, and\r\nthree with spinous involucres enclosing an eatable sweet nut; these\r\ngenerally grow on a dry clayey soil.\r\n\r\nSome low steep spurs were well cultivated, though the angle of the\r\nfield was upwards of 25°; the crops, chiefly maize, were just\r\nsprouting. This plant is occasionally hermaphrodite in Sikkim, the\r\nflowers forming a large drooping panicle and ripening small grains; it\r\nis, however, a rare occurrence, and the specimens are highly valued by\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe general prevalence of figs,[52] and their allies, the nettles,[53]\r\nis a remarkable feature in the botany of the Sikkim Himalaya, up to\r\nnearly 10,000 feet. Of the former there were here five species, some\r\nbearing eatable and very palatable fruit of enormous size, others with\r\nthe fruit small and borne on prostrate, leafless branches, which spring\r\nfrom the root and creep along the ground.\r\n\r\n [52] One species of this very tropical genus ascends almost to 9000\r\n feet on the outer ranges of Sikkim.\r\n\r\n\r\n [53] Of two of these cloth is made, and of a third, cordage. The tops\r\n of two are eaten, as are several species of _Procris._ The “Poa”\r\n belongs to this order, yielding that kind of grass cloth fibre, now\r\n abundantly imported into England from the Malay Islands, and used\r\n extensively for shirting.\r\n\r\n\r\nA troublesome, dipterous insect (the “Peepsa,” a species of\r\n_Siamulium_) swarms on the banks of the streams; it is very small and\r\nblack, floating like a speck before the eye; its bite leaves a spot of\r\nextravasated blood under the cuticle, very irritating if not opened.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Little Rungeet river, we camped on the base of Tonglo. The\r\nnight was calm and clear, with faint cirrus, but no dew. A thermometer\r\nsunk two feet in rich vegetable mould stood at 78° two hours after it\r\nwas lowered, and the same on the following morning. This probably\r\nindicates the mean temperature of the month at that spot, where,\r\nhowever, the dark colour of the exposed loose soil must raise the\r\ntemperature considerably.\r\n\r\n_May 20th._—The temperature at sunrise was 67°; the morning bright, and\r\nclear over head, but the mountains looked threatening. Dorjiling,\r\nperched on a ridge 5000 feet above us, had a singular appearance. We\r\nascended the Simonbong spur of Tonglo, so called from a small village\r\nand Lama temple of that name on its summit; where we arrived at noon,\r\nand passing some chaits[54] gained the Lama’s residence.\r\n\r\n [54] The chait of Sikkim, borrowed from Tibet, is a square pedestal,\r\n surmounted with a hemisphere, the convex end downwards, and on it is\r\n placed a cone, with a crescent on the top. These are erected as tombs\r\n to Lamas, and as monuments to illustrious persons, and are venerated\r\n accordingly, the people always passing them from left to right, often\r\n repeating the invocation, “Ora Mani Padmi om.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo species of bamboo, the “Payong” and “Praong” of the Lepchas, here\r\nreplace the Pao of the lower regions. The former was flowering\r\nabundantly, the whole of the culms (which were 20 feet high) being a\r\ndiffuse panicle of inflorescence. The “Praong” bears a round head of\r\nflowers at the ends of the leafy branches. Wild strawberry, violet,\r\ngeranium, etc., announced our approach to the temperate zone. Around\r\nthe temple were potato crops and peach-trees, rice, millet, yam,\r\nbrinjal (egg-apple), fennel, hemp (for smoking its narcotic leaves),\r\nand cummin, etc. The potato thrives extremely well as a summer crop, at\r\n7000 feet, in Sikkim, though I think the root (from the Dorjiling\r\nstock) cultivated as a winter crop in the plains, is superior both in\r\nsize and flavour. Peaches never ripen in this part of Sikkim,\r\napparently from the want of sun; the tree grows well at from 3000 to\r\n7000 feet elevation, and flowers abundantly; the fruit making the\r\nnearest approach to maturity (according to the elevation) from July to\r\nOctober. At Dorjiling it follows the English seasons, flowering in\r\nMarch and fruiting in September, when the scarce reddened and still\r\nhard fruit falls from the tree. In the plains of India, both this and\r\nthe plum ripen in May, but the fruits are very acid.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that throughout this temperate region, there is hardly an\r\neatable fruit except the native walnut, and some brambles, of which the\r\n“yellow” and “ground raspberry” are the best, some insipid figs, and a\r\nvery austere crab-apple. The European apple will scarcely ripen,[55]\r\nand the pear not at all. Currants and gooseberries show no disposition\r\nto thrive, and strawberries are the only fruits that ripen at all,\r\nwhich they do in the greatest abundance. Vines, figs, pomegranates,\r\nplums, apricots, etc., will not succeed even as trees. European\r\nvegetables again grow, and thrive remarkably well throughout the summer\r\nof Dorjiling, and the produce is very fair, sweet and good, but\r\ninferior in flavour to the English.\r\n\r\n [55] This fruit, and several others, ripen at Katmandoo, in Nepal\r\n (alt. 4000 feet), which place enjoys more sunshine than Sikkim. I\r\n have, however, received very differedt accounts of the produce, which,\r\n on the whole, appears to be inferior.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf tropical fruits cultivated below 4000 feet, oranges and indifferent\r\nbananas alone are frequent, with lemons of various kinds. The season\r\nfor these is, however, very short; though that of the plantain might\r\nwith care be prolonged; oranges abound in winter, and are excellent,\r\nbut neither so large nor free of white pulp as those of the Khasia\r\nhills, the West Indies, or the west coast of Africa. Mangos are brought\r\nfrom the plains, for though wild in Sikkim, the cultivated kinds do not\r\nthrive; I have seen the pine-apple plant, but I never met with good\r\nfruit on it.\r\n\r\nA singular and almost total absence of the light, and of the direct\r\nrays of the sun in the ripening season, is the cause of this dearth of\r\nfruit. Both the farmer and orchard gardener in England know full well\r\nthe value of a bright sky as well as of a warm autumnal atmosphere.\r\nWithout this corn does not ripen, and fruit-trees are blighted. The\r\nwinter of the plains of India being more analogous in its distribution\r\nof moisture and heat to a European summer, such fruits as the peach,\r\nvine, and even plum, fig, strawberry, etc., may be brought to bear well\r\nin March, April, and May, if they are only carefully tended through the\r\nprevious hot and damp season, which is, in respect to the functions of\r\nflowering and fruiting, their winter.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that, though some English fruits will turn the winter\r\nsolstice of Bengal (November to May) into summer, and then flower and\r\nfruit, neither these nor others will thrive in the summer of 7000 feet\r\non the Sikkim Himalaya, (though its temperature so nearly approaches\r\nthat of England,) on account of its rain and fogs. Further, they are\r\noften exposed to a winter’s cold equal to the average of that of\r\nLondon, the snow lying for a week on the ground, and the thermometer\r\ndescending to 25°. It is true that in no case is the extreme of cold so\r\ngreat here as in England, but it is sufficient to check vegetation, and\r\nto prevent fruit-trees from flowering till they are fruiting in the\r\nplains. There is in this respect a great difference between the climate\r\nof the central and eastern and western Himalaya, at equal elevations.\r\nIn the western (Kumaon, etc.) the winters are colder than in Sikkim—the\r\nsummers warmer and less humid. The rainy season is shorter, and the sun\r\nshines so much more frequently between the heavy showers, that the\r\napple and other fruits are brought to a much better state. It is true\r\nthat the rain-gauge may show as great a fall there, but this is no\r\nmeasure of the humidity of the atmosphere, and still less so of the\r\namount of the sun’s direct light and heat intercepted by aqueous\r\nvapour, for it takes no account of the quantity of moisture suspended\r\nin the air, nor of the depositions from fogs, which are far more fatal\r\nto the perfecting of fruits than the heaviest brief showers. The Indian\r\nclimate, which is marked by one season of excessive humidity and the\r\nother of excessive drought, can never be favourable to the production\r\neither of good European or tropical fruits. Hence there is not one of\r\nthe latter peculiar to the country, and perhaps but one which arrives\r\nat full perfection; namely, the mango. Tile plantains, oranges, and\r\npine-apples are less abundant, of inferior kinds, and remain a shorter\r\nseason in perfection than they do in South America, the West Indies, or\r\nWestern Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lepcha amulet]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nContinue the ascent of Tonglo—Trees—Lepcha construction of\r\nhut—Simsibong—Climbing-trees—Frogs—Magnolias,\r\netc.—Ticks—Leeches—Cattle, murrain amongst—Summit of\r\nTonglo—Rhododendrons—Skimmia—Yew—Rose—Aconite—Bikh poison—English\r\ngenera of plants—Ascent of tropical orders—Comparison with south\r\ntemperate zone—Heavy rain—Temperature, etc.—Descent—Simonbong\r\ntemple—Furniture therein—Praying-cylinder—Thigh-bone trumpet—Morning\r\norisons—Present of Murwa beer, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing the ascent of Tonglo, we left cultivation and the poor\r\ngroves of peaches at 4000 to 5000 feet (and this on the eastern\r\nexposure, which is by far the sunniest), the average height which\r\nagriculture reaches in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nAbove Simonbong, the path up Tonglo is little frequented: it is one of\r\nthe many routes between Nepal and Sikkim, which cross the Singalelah\r\nspur of Kinchinjunga at various elevations between 7000 and 15,000\r\nfeet. As usual, the track runs along ridges, wherever these are to be\r\nfound, very steep, and narrow at the top, through deep humid forests of\r\noaks and Magnolias, many laurels, both 1 _Tetranthera_ and\r\n_Cinnamomum,_ one species of the latter ascending to 8,500 feet, and\r\none of _Tetranthera_ to 9000. Chesnut and walnut here appeared, with\r\nsome leguminous trees, which however did not ascend to 6000 feet.\r\nScarlet flowers of _Vaccinium serpens,_ an epiphytical species, were\r\nstrewed about, and the great blossoms of _Rhododendron Dalhousiæ_ and\r\nof a Magnolia (_Talaunaa Hodgsoni_) lay together on the ground. The\r\nlatter forms a large tree, with very dense foliage, and deep shining\r\ngreen leaves, a foot to eighteen inches long. Most of its flowers drop\r\nunexpanded from the tree, and diffuse a very aromatic smell; they are\r\nnearly as large as the fist, the outer petals purple, the inner pure\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nHeavy rain came on at 3 p.m., obliging us to take insufficient shelter\r\nunder the trees, and finally to seek the nearest camping-ground. For\r\nthis purpose we ascended to a spring, called Simsibong, at an elevation\r\nof 6000 feet. The narrowness of the ridge prevented our pitching the\r\ntent, small as it was; but the Lepchas rapidly constructed a house, and\r\nthatched it with bamboo and the broad leaves of the wild plantain. A\r\ntable was then raised in the middle, of four posts and as many cross\r\npieces of wood, lashed with strips of bamboo. Across these, pieces of\r\nbamboo were laid, ingeniously flattened, by selecting cylinders,\r\ncrimping them all round, and then slitting each down one side, so that\r\nit opens into a flat slab. Similar but longer and lower erections, one\r\non each side the table, formed bed or chair; and in one hour, half a\r\ndozen men, with only long knives and active hands, had provided us with\r\na tolerably water-tight furnished house. A thick flooring of bamboo\r\nleaves kept the feet dry, and a screen of that and other foliage all\r\nround rendered the habitation tolerably warm.\r\n\r\nAt this elevation we found great scandent trees twisting around the\r\ntrunks of others, and strangling them: the latter gradually decay,\r\nleaving the sheath of climbers as one of the most remarkable vegetable\r\nphenomena of these mountains. These climbers belong to several orders,\r\nand may be roughly classified in two groups.—(1.) Those whose sterns\r\nmerely twine, and by constricting certain parts of their support,\r\ninduce death.—(2.) Those which form a network round the trunk, by the\r\ncoalescence of their lateral branches and aerial roots, etc.: these\r\nwholly envelop and often conceal the tree they enclose, whose branches\r\nappear rising far above those of its destroyer. To the first of these\r\ngroups belong many natural orders, of which the most prominent\r\nare—_Leguminosæ,_ ivies, hydrangea, vines, _Pothos,_ etc. The\r\ninosculating ones are almost all figs and _Wightia_: the latter is the\r\nmost remarkable, and I add a cut of its grasping roots, sketched at our\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clasping roots of Wightia]\r\n\r\nExcept for the occasional hooting of an owl, the night was profoundly\r\nstill during several hours after dark—the cicadas at this season not\r\nascending so high on the mountain. A dense mist shrouded every thing,\r\nand the rain pattered on the leaves of our hut. At midnight a tree-frog\r\n(“Simook,” Lepcha) broke the silence with his curious metallic clack,\r\nand others quickly joined the chorus, keeping up their strange music\r\ntill morning. Like many Batrachians, this has a voice singularly unlike\r\nthat of any other organised creature. The cries of beasts, birds, and\r\ninsects are all explicable to our senses, and we can recognise most of\r\nthem as belonging to such or such an order of animal; but the voices of\r\nmany frogs are like nothing else, and allied species utter totally\r\ndissimilar noises. In some, as this, the sound is like the concussion\r\nof metals; in others, of the vibration of wires or cords; anything but\r\nthe natural effects of lungs, larynx, and muscles.[56]\r\n\r\n [56] A very common Tasmanian species utters a sound that appears to\r\n ring in an underground vaulted chamber, beneath the feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 21._—Early this morning we proceeded upwards, our prospect more\r\ngloomy than ever. The path, which still lay up steep ridges, was very\r\nslippery, owing to the rain upon the clayey soil, and was only passable\r\nfrom the hold afforded by interlacing roots of trees. At 8000 feet,\r\nsome enormous detached masses of micaceous gneiss rose abruptly from\r\nthe ridge, they were covered with mosses and ferns, and from their\r\nsummit, 7000 feet, a good view of the surrounding vegetation is\r\nobtained. The mast of the forest is formed of:—(1) Three species of\r\noak, of which _Q. annulata?_ with immense lamellated acorns, and leaves\r\nsixteen inches long, is the tallest and the most abundant.—(2)\r\nChesnut.—(3) _Laurineæ_ of several species, all beautiful forest-trees,\r\nstraight-holed, and umbrageous above.—(4) Magnolias.[57]—(5)\r\nArborescent rhododendrons, which commence here with the _R. arboreum._\r\nAt 8000 and 9000 feet, a considerable change is found in the\r\nvegetation; the gigantic purple _Magnolia Campbellii_ replacing the\r\nwhite; chesnut disappears, and several laurels: other kinds of maple\r\nare seen, with _Rhododendron argenteum,_ and _Stauntonia,_ a handsome\r\nclimber, which has beautiful pendent clusters of lilac blossoms.\r\n\r\n [57] Other trees were _Pyrus, Saurauja_ (both an erect and climbing\r\n species), _Olea,_ cherry, birch, alder, several maples, _Hydrangea,_\r\n one species of fig, holly, and several _Araliaceous_ trees. Many\r\n species of _Magnoliaceæ_ (including the genera _Magnolia, Michelia,_\r\n and _Talauma_) are found in Sikkim: _Magnolia Campbellii,_ of 10,000\r\n feet, is the most superb species known. In books on botanical\r\n geography, the magnolias are considered as most abounding in North\r\n America, east of the Rocky Mountains; but this is a great mistake, the\r\n Indian mountains and islands being the centre of this natural order.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 9000 feet we arrived on a long flat covered with lofty trees,\r\nchiefly purple magnolias, with a few oaks, great _Pyri_ and two\r\nrhododendrons, thirty to forty feet high (_R. barbatum,_ and _R.\r\narboreum,_ var. _roseum_): _Skimmia_ and _Symplocos_ were the common\r\nshrubs. A beautiful orchid with purple flowers (_Cælogyne Wallichii_)\r\ngrew on the trunks of all the great trees, attaining a higher elevation\r\nthan most other epiphytical species, for I have seen it at 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\nA large tick infests the small bamboo, and a more hateful insect I\r\nnever encountered. The traveller cannot avoid these insects coming on\r\nhis person (sometimes in great numbers) as he brushes through the\r\nforest; they get inside his dress, and insert the proboscis deeply\r\nwithout pain. Buried head and shoulders, and retained by a barbed\r\nlancet, the tick is only to be extracted by force, which is very\r\npainful. I have devised many tortures, mechanical and chemical, to\r\ninduce these disgusting intruders to withdraw the proboscis, but in\r\nvain. Leeches[58] also swarm below 7000 feet; a small black species\r\nabove 3000 feet, and a large yellow-brown solitary one below that\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n [58] I cannot but think that the extraordinary abundance of these\r\n _Anelides_ in Sikkim may cause the death of many animals. Some marked\r\n murrains have followed very wet seasons, when the leeches appear in\r\n incredible numbers; and the disease in the cattle, described to me by\r\n the Lepchas as in the stomach, in no way differs from what leeches\r\n would produce. It is a well-known fact, that these creatures have\r\n lived for days in the fauces, nares, and stomachs of the human\r\n subject, causing dreadful sufferings, and death. I have seen the\r\n cattle feeding in places where the leeches so abounded, that fifty or\r\n sixty were frequently together on my ankles; and ponies are almost\r\n maddened by their biting the fetlocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ascent to the summit was by the bed of a watercourse, now a roaring\r\ntorrent, from the heavy and incessant rain. A small _Anagallis_ (like\r\n_tenella_), and a beautiful purple primrose, grew by its bank. The top\r\nof the mountain is another flat ridge, with depressions and broad\r\npools. The number of additional species of plants found here was great,\r\nand all betokened a rapid approach to the alpine region of the\r\nHimalaya. In order of prevalence the trees were,—the scarlet\r\n_Rhododendron arboreum_ and _barbatum,_ as large bushy trees, both\r\nloaded with beautiful flowers and luxuriant foliage; _R. Falconeri,_ in\r\npoint of foliage the most superb of all the Himalayan species, with\r\ntrunks thirty feet high, and branches bearing at their ends only leaves\r\neighteen inches long: these are deep green above, and covered beneath\r\nwith a rich brown down. Next in abundance to these were shrubs of\r\n_Skimmia Laureola,_[59] _Symplocos,_ and Hydrangea; and there were\r\nstill a few purple magnolias, very large _Pyri,_ like mountain ash, and\r\nthe common English yew, eighteen feet in circumference, the red bark of\r\nwhich is used as a dye, and for staining the foreheads of Brahmins in\r\nNepal. An erect white-flowered rose (_R. sericea,_ the only species\r\noccurring in Southern Sikkim) was very abundant: its numerous inodorous\r\nflowers are pendent, apparent as a protection from the rain; and it is\r\nremarkable as being the only species having four petals instead of\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n [59] This plant has been lately introduced into English gardens, from\r\n the north-west Himalaya, and is greatly admired for its aromatic,\r\n evergreen foliage, and clusters of scarlet berries. It is a curious\r\n fact, that this plant never bears scarlet berries in Sikkim,\r\n apparently owing to the want of sun; the fruit ripens, but is of a\r\n greenish-red or purplish colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nA currant was common, always growing epiphytically on the trunks of\r\nlarge trees. Two or three species of Berberry, a cherry, Andromeda,\r\n_Daphne,_ and maple, nearly complete, I think, the list of woody\r\nplants. Amongst the herbs were many of great interest, as a rhubarb,\r\nand _Aconitum palmatum,_ which yields one of the celebrated “Bikh”\r\npoisons.[60] Of European genera I found _Thalictrum, Anemone, Fumaria,_\r\nviolets, _Stellaria, Hypericum,_ two geraniums, balsams, _Epilobium,\r\nPotentilla, Paris_ and _Convallariæ,_ one of the latter has\r\nverticillate leaves, and its root also called “bikh,” is considered a\r\nvery virulent poison.\r\n\r\n [60] “Bikh” is yielded by various _Aconita._ All the Sikkim kinds are\r\n called “gniong” by Lepchas and Bhoteeas, who do not distinguish them.\r\n The _A. Napellus_ is abundant in the north-west Himalaya, and is\r\n perhaps as virulent a Bikh as any species.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, the absence or rarity at this elevation of several very large\r\nnatural families,[61] which have numerous representatives at and much\r\nbelow the same level in the inner ranges, and on the outer of the\r\nWestern Himalaya, indicate a certain peculiarity in Sikkim. On the\r\nother hand, certain tropical genera are more abundant in the temperate\r\nzone of the Sikkim mountains, and ascend much higher there than in the\r\nWestern Himalaya: of this fact I have cited conspicuous examples in the\r\npalms, plantains, and tree-ferns. This ascent and prevalence of\r\ntropical species is due to the humidity and equability of the climate\r\nin this temperate zone, and is, perhaps, the direct consequence of\r\nthese conditions. An application of the same laws accounts for the\r\nextension of similar features far beyond the tropical limit in the\r\nSouthern Ocean, where various natural orders, which do not cross the\r\n30th and 40th parallels of N. latitude, are extended to the 55th of S.\r\nlatitude, and found in Tasmania, New Zealand, the so-called Antarctic\r\nIslands south of that group, and at Cape Horn itself.\r\n\r\n [61] _Ranunculaceæ, Fumariæ, Cruciferæ, Alsineæ, Geranicæ, Leguminosæ,\r\n Potentilla, Epilobium, Crassulaceæ, Saxifrageæ, Umbelliferæ, Lonicera,\r\n Valerianeæ, Dipsaceæ,_ various genera of _Compositæ, Campanulaceæ,\r\n Lobeliaceæ, Gentianeæ, Boragineæ, Scrophularineæ, Primulaceæ,\r\n Gramineæ._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rarity of Pines is perhaps the most curious feature in the botany\r\nof Tonglo, and on the outer ranges of Sikkim; for, between the level of\r\n2,500 feet (the upper limit of _P. longifolia_) and 10,000 feet (that\r\nof the _Taxus_), there is no coniferous tree whatever in Southern\r\nSikkim.\r\n\r\nWe encamped amongst Rhododendrons, on a spongy soil of black vegetable\r\nmatter, so oozy, that it was difficult to keep the feet dry. The rain\r\npoured in torrents all the evening, and with the calm, and the wetness\r\nof the wood, prevented our enjoying a fire. Except a transient view\r\ninto Nepal, a few miles west of us, nothing was to be seen, the whole\r\nmountain being wrapped in dense masses of vapour. Gusts of wind, not\r\nfelt in the forest, whistled through the gnarled and naked tree-tops;\r\nand though the temperature was 50°, this wind produced cold to the\r\nfeelings. Our poor Lepchas were miserably off, but always happy: under\r\nfour posts and a bamboo-leaf thatch, with no covering but a single thin\r\ncotton garment, they crouched on the sodden turf, joking with the\r\nHindoos of our party, who, though supplied with good clothing and\r\nshelter, were doleful companions.\r\n\r\nI made a shed for my instruments under a tree; Mr. Barnes, ever active\r\nand ready, floored the tent with logs of wood, and I laid a “corduroy\r\nroad” of the same to my little observatory.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the rain did not abate; and the tent-roof leaked in\r\nsuch torrents, that we had to throw pieces of wax-cloth over our\r\nshoulders as we lay in bed. There was no improvement whatever in the\r\nweather on the following morning. Two of the Hindoos had crawled into\r\nthe tent during the night, attacked with fever and ague.[62] The tent\r\nbeing too sodden to be carried, we had to remain where we were, and\r\nwith abundance of novelty in the botany around, I found no difficulty\r\nin getting through the day. Observing the track of sheep, we sent two\r\nLepchas to follow them, who returned at night from some miles west in\r\nNepal, bringing two. The shepherds were Geroongs of Nepal, who were\r\ngrazing their flocks on a grassy mountain top, from which the woods had\r\nbeen cleared, probably by fire. The mutton was a great boon to the\r\nLepchas, but the Hindoos would not touch it, and several more sickening\r\nduring the day, we had the tent most uncomfortably full.\r\n\r\n [62] It is a remarkable fact, that both the natives of the plains,\r\n under many circumstances, and the Lepchas when suffering from\r\n protracted cold and wet, take fever and ague in sharp attacks. The\r\n disease is wholly unknown amongst Europeans residing above 4000 feet,\r\n similar exposure in whom brings on rheumatism and cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the 22nd, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., the thermometer\r\nnever varied 6·5°, ranging from 47·5 in the morning to 54°, its\r\nmaximum, at 1 p.m., and 50·75 at night. At seven the following morning\r\nit was the same. One, sunk two feet six inches in mould and clay, stood\r\nconstantly at 50·75. The dew-point was always below the temperature, at\r\nwhich I was surprised, for more drenching weather could not well be.\r\nThe mean dew-point was 50·25, and consequent humidity, 0·973.\r\n\r\nThese observations, and those of the barometer, were taken 60 feet\r\nbelow the summit, to which I moved the instruments on the morning of\r\nthe 23rd. At a much more exposed spot the results would no doubt have\r\nbeen different, for a thermometer, there sunk to the same depth as that\r\nbelow, stood at 49·75 (or one degree colder than 60 feet lower down).\r\nMy barometrical observations, taken simultaneously with those of\r\nCalcutta, give the height of Tonglo, 10,078·3 feet; Colonel Waugh’s, by\r\ntrigonometry, 10,079·4 feet,—a remarkable and unusual coincidence.\r\n\r\n_May 23._—We spent a few hours of alternate fog and sunshine on the top\r\nof the mountain, vainly hoping for the most modest view; our inability\r\nto obtain it was extremely disappointing, for the mountain commands a\r\nsuperb prospect, which I enjoyed fully in the following November, from\r\na spot a few miles further west. The air, which was always foggy, was\r\nalternately cooled and heated, as it blew over the trees, or the open\r\nspace we occupied; sometimes varying 5° and 6° in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nHaving partially dried the tent in the wind, we commenced the descent,\r\nwhich owing to the late torrents of rain, was most fatiguing and\r\nslippery; it again commenced to drizzle at noon, nor was it till we had\r\ndescended to 6000 feet that we emerged from the region of clouds. By\r\ndark we arrived at Simonbong, having descended 5000 feet, at the rate\r\nof 1000 feet an hour; and were kindly received by the Lama, who gave us\r\nhis temple for the accommodation of the whole party. We were surprised\r\nat this, both because the Sikkim authorities had represented the Lamas\r\nas very averse to Europeans, and because he might well have hesitated\r\nbefore admitting a promiscuous horde of thirty people into a sacred\r\nbuilding, where the little valuables on the altar, etc., were quite at\r\nour disposal. A better tribute could not well have been paid to the\r\nhonesty of my Lepcha followers. Our host only begged us not to disturb\r\nhis people, nor to allow the Hindoos of our party to smoke inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simonbong Temple]\r\n\r\nSimonbong is one of the smallest and poorest Gumpas, or temples, in\r\nSikkim: unlike the better class, it is built of wood only. It consisted\r\nof one large room, with small sliding shutter windows, raised on a\r\nstone foundation, and roofed with shingles of wood; opposite the door a\r\nwooden altar was placed, rudely chequered with black, white, and red;\r\nto the right and left were shelves, with a few Tibetan books, wrapped\r\nin silk; a model of Symbonath temple in Nepal, a praying-cylinder,[63]\r\nand some implements for common purposes, bags of juniper, English\r\nwine-bottles and glasses, with tufts of _Abies Webbiana,_ rhododendron\r\nflowers, and peacock’s feathers, besides various trifles, clay\r\nornaments and offerings, and little Hindoo idols. On the altar were\r\nranged seven little brass cups, full of water; a large conch shell,\r\ncarved with the sacred lotus; a brass jug from Lhassa, of beautiful\r\ndesign, and a human thigh-bone, hollow, and perforated through both\r\ncondyles.[64]\r\n\r\n [63] It consisted of a leathern cylinder placed upright in a frame; a\r\n projecting piece of iron strikes a little bell at each revolution, the\r\n revolution being caused by an elbowed axle and string. Within the\r\n cylinder are deposited written prayers, and whoever pulls the string\r\n properly is considered to have repeated his prayers as often as the\r\n bell rings. Representations of these implements will be found in other\r\n parts of these volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n [64] To these are often added a double-headed rattle, or small drum,\r\n formed of two crowns of human skulls, cemented back to back; each face\r\n is then covered with parchment, and encloses some pebbles. Sometimes\r\n this instrument is provided with a handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: rumpet made of a human thigh-bone]\r\n\r\nFacing the altar was a bench and a chair, and on one side a huge\r\ntambourine, with two curved iron drum-sticks. The bench was covered\r\nwith bells, handsomely carved with idols, and censers with\r\njuniper-ashes; and on it lay the _dorge,_ or double-headed thunderbolt,\r\nwhich the Lama holds in his hand during service. Of all these articles,\r\nthe human thigh-bone is by much the most curious; it is very often that\r\nof a Lama, and is valuable in proportion to its length.[65] As,\r\nhowever, the Sikkim Lamas are burned, the relics are generally procured\r\nfrom Tibet, where the corpses are cut in pieces and thrown to the\r\nkites, or into the water.\r\n\r\n [65] It is reported at Dorjiling, that one of the first Europeans\r\n buried at this station, being a tall man, was disinterred by the\r\n resurrectionist Bhoteeas for his _trumpet-bones._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo boys usually reside in the temple, and their beds were given up to\r\nus, which being only rough planks laid on the floor, proved clean in\r\none sense, but contrasted badly with the springy couch of bamboo the\r\nLepcha makes, which renders carrying a mattress or aught but blankets\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n_May 24._—We were awakened at daylight by the discordant orisons of the\r\nLama; these commenced by the boys beating the great tambourine, then\r\nblowing the conch-shells, and finally the trumpets and thigh-bone.\r\nShortly the Lama entered, clad in scarlet, shorn and barefooted,\r\nwearing a small red silk mitre, a loose gown girt round the middle, and\r\nan under-garment of questionable colour, possibly once purple. He\r\nwalked along, slowly muttering his prayers, to the end of the\r\napartment, whence he took a brass bell and dorge, and, sitting down\r\ncross-legged, commenced matins, counting his beads, or ringing the\r\nbell, and uttering most dismal prayers. After various disposals of the\r\ncups, a larger bell was violently rung for some minutes, himself\r\nsnapping his fingers and uttering most unearthly sounds. Finally,\r\nincense was brought, of charcoal with juniper-sprigs; it was swung\r\nabout, and concluded the morning service to our great relief, for the\r\nnoises were quite intolerable. Fervid as the devotions appeared, to\r\njudge by their intonation, I fear the Lama felt more curious about us\r\nthan was proper under the circumstances; and when I tried to sketch\r\nhim, his excitement knew no bounds; he fairly turned round on the\r\nsettee, and, continuing his prayers and bell-accompaniment, appeared to\r\nbe exorcising me, or some spirit within me.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the Lama came to visit us, bringing rice, a few\r\nvegetables, and a large bamboo-work bowl, thickly varnished with\r\nindia-rubber, and waterproof, containing half-fermented millet. This\r\nmixture, called _Murwa,_ is invariably offered to the traveller, either\r\nin the state of fermented grain, or more commonly in a bamboo jug,\r\nfilled quite up with warm water; when the fluid, sucked through a reed,\r\naffords a refreshing drink. He gratefully accepted a few rupees and\r\ntrifles which we had to spare.\r\n\r\nLeaving Simonbong, we descended to the Little Rungeet, where the heat\r\nof the valley was very great; 80° at noon, and that of the stream 69°;\r\nthe latter was an agreeable temperature for the coolies, who plunged,\r\nteeming with perspiration, into the water, catching fish with their\r\nhands. We reached Dorjiling late in the evening, again drenched with\r\nrain; our people, Hindoo and Lepcha, imprudently remaining for the\r\nnight in the valley. Owing probably as much to the great exposure they\r\nhad lately gone through, as to the sudden transition from a mean\r\ntemperature of 50° in a bracing wind, to a hot close jungly valley at\r\n75°, no less than seven were laid up with fever and ague.\r\n\r\nFew excursions can afford a better idea of the general features and\r\nrich luxuriance of the Sikkim Himalaya than that to Tonglo. It is\r\nalways interesting to roam with an aboriginal, and especially a\r\nmountain people, through their thinly inhabited valleys, over their\r\ngrand mountains, and to dwell alone with them in their gloomy and\r\nforbidding forests, and no thinking man can do so without learning\r\nmuch, however slender be the means at his command for communion. A more\r\ninteresting and attractive companion than the Lepcha I never lived\r\nwith: cheerful, kind, and patient with a master to whom he is attached;\r\nrude but not savage, ignorant and yet intelligent; with the simple\r\nresource of a plain knife he makes his house and furnishes yours, with\r\na speed, alacrity, and ingenuity that wile away that well-known long\r\nhour when the weary pilgrim frets for his couch. In all my dealings\r\nwith these people, they proved scrupulously honest. Except for\r\ndrunkenness and carelessness, I never had to complain of any of the\r\nmerry troop; some of whom, bareheaded and barelegged, possessing little\r\nor nothing save a cotton garment and a long knife, followed me for many\r\nmonths on subsequent occasions, from the scorching plains to the\r\neverlasting snows. Ever foremost in the forest or on the bleak\r\nmountain, and ever ready to help, to carry, to encamp, collect, or\r\ncook, they cheer on the traveller by their unostentatious zeal in his\r\nservice, and are spurs to his progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibetan amulet]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nDifficulty in procuring leave to enter Sikkim—Obtain permission to\r\ntravel in East Nepal—Arrangements—Coolies—Stores—Servants—Personal\r\nequipment—Mode of travelling—Leave Dorjiling—Goong ridge—Behaviour of\r\nBhotan coolies—Nepal frontier—Myong valley—Ilam—Sikkim\r\nmassacre—Cultivation—Nettles—Camp at Nanki on Tonglo—Bhotan coolies run\r\naway—View of Chumulari—Nepal peaks to west—Sakkiazung—Buceros—Road to\r\nWallanchoon—Oaks—Scarcity of water—Singular view of\r\nmountain-valleys—Encampment—My tent and its furniture—Evening\r\noccupations—Dunkotah—Crossridge of Sakkiazung—Yews—Silver-firs—View of\r\nTambur valley—Pemmi river—Pebbly terraces—Geology—Holy springs—Enormous\r\ntrees—Luculia gratissima—Khawa river, rocks of—Arrive at Tambur—Shingle\r\nand gravel terraces—Natives, indolence of—Canoe ferry—Votive\r\nofferings—Bad road—Temperature, etc.—Chingtam village, view from—Mywa\r\nriver and Guola—House—Boulders—Chain-bridge—Meepo, arrival of—Fevers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the unsatisfactory nature of our relations with the Sikkim\r\nauthorities, to which I have elsewhere alluded, my endeavours to\r\nprocure leave to penetrate further beyond the Dorjiling territory than\r\nTonglo, were attended with some trouble and delay.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1848, the Governor-General communicated with the\r\nRajah, desiring him to grant me honourable and safe escort through his\r\ndominions; but this was at once met by a decided refusal, apparently\r\nadmitting of no compromise. Pending further negotiations, which Dr.\r\nCampbell felt sure would terminate satisfactorily, though perhaps too\r\nlate for my purpose, he applied to the Nepal Rajah for permission for\r\nme to visit the Tibetan passes, west of Kinchinjunga; proposing in the\r\nmeanwhile to arrange for my return through Sikkim. Through the kindness\r\nof Col. Thoresby, the Resident at that Court, and the influence of Jung\r\nBahadoor, this request was promptly acceded to, and a guard of six\r\nNepalese soldiers and two officers was sent to Dorjiling to conduct me\r\nto any part of the eastern districts of Nepal which I might select. I\r\ndecided upon following up the Tambur, a branch of the Arun river, and\r\nexploring the two easternmost of the Nepalese passes into Tibet\r\n(Wallanchoon and Kanglachem), which would bring me as near to the\r\ncentral mass and loftiest part of the eastern flank of Kinchinjunga as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nFor this expedition (which occupied three months), all the arrangements\r\nwere undertaken for me by Dr. Campbell, who aforded me every facility\r\nwhich in his government position he could command, besides personally\r\nsuperintending the equipment and provisioning of my party. Taking\r\nhorses or loaded animals of any kind was not expedient: the whole\r\njourney was to be performed on foot, and everything carried on men’s\r\nbacks. As we were to march through wholly unexplored countries, where\r\nfood was only procurable at uncertain intervals, it was necessary to\r\nengage a large body of porters, some of whom should carry bags of rice\r\nfor the coolies and themselves too. The difficulty of selecting these\r\ncarriers, of whom thirty were required, was very great. The Lepchas,\r\nthe best and most tractable, and over whom Dr. Campbell had the most\r\ndirect influence, disliked employment out of Sikkim, especially in so\r\nwarlike a country as Nepal: and they were besides thought unfit for the\r\nsnowy regions. The Nepalese, of whom there were many residing as\r\nBritish subjects in Dorjiling, were mostly run-aways from their own\r\ncountry, and afraid of being claimed, should they return to it, by the\r\nlords of the soil. To employ Limboos, Moormis, Hindoos, or other\r\nnatives of low elevations, was out of the question; and no course\r\nappeared advisable but to engage some of the Bhotan run-aways domiciled\r\nin Dorjiling, who are accustomed to travel at all elevations, and fear\r\nnothing but a return to the country which they have abandoned as\r\nslaves, or as culprits: they are immensely powerful, and though\r\nintractable to the last degree, are generally glad to work and behave\r\nwell for money. The choice, as will hereafter be seen, was unfortunate,\r\nthough at the time unanimously approved.\r\n\r\nMy party mustered fifty-six persons. These consisted of myself, and one\r\npersonal servant, a Portuguese half-caste, who undertook all offices,\r\nand spared me the usual train of Hindoo and Mahometan servants. My tent\r\nand equipments (for which I was greatly indebted to Mr. Hodgson),\r\ninstruments, bed, box of clothes, books and papers, required a man for\r\neach. Seven more carried my papers for drying plants, and other\r\nscientific stores. The Nepalese guard had two coolies of their own. My\r\ninterpreter, the coolie Sirdar (or headman), and my chief plant\r\ncollector (a Lepcha), had a man each. Mr. Hodgson’s bird and animal\r\nshooter, collector, and stuffer, with their ammunition and\r\nindispensables, had four more; there were besides, three Lepcha lads to\r\nclimb trees and change the plant-papers, who had long been in my\r\nservice in that capacity; and the party was completed by fourteen\r\nBhotan coolies laden with food, consisting chiefly of rice with ghee,\r\noil, capsicums, salt, and flour.\r\n\r\nI carried myself a small barometer, a large knife and digger for\r\nplants, note-book, telescope, compass, and other instruments; whilst\r\ntwo or three Lepcha lads who accompanied me as satellites, carried a\r\nbotanising box, thermometers, sextant and artificial horizon,\r\nmeasuring-tape, azimuth compass and stand, geological hammer, bottles\r\nand boxes for insects, sketch-book, etc., arranged in compartments of\r\nstrong canvass bags. The Nepal officer (of the rank of serjeant, I\r\nbelieve) always kept near me with one of his men, rendering innumerable\r\nlittle services. Other sepoys were distributed amongst the remainder of\r\nthe party; one went ahead to prepare camping-ground, and one brought up\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\nThe course generally pursued by Himalayan travellers is to march early\r\nin the morning, and arrive at the camping-ground before or by noon,\r\nbreakfasting before starting, or _en route._ I never followed this\r\nplan, because it sacrificed the mornings, which were otherwise\r\nprofitably spent in collecting about camp; whereas, if I set off early,\r\nI was generally too tired with the day’s march to employ in any active\r\npursuit the rest of the daylight, which in November only lasted till 6\r\np.m. The men breakfasted early in the morning, I somewhat later, and\r\nall had started by 10 a.m., arriving between 4 and 6 p.m. at the next\r\ncamping-ground. My tent was formed of blankets, spread over cross\r\npieces of wood and a ridge-pole, enclosing an area of 6 to 8 feet by 4\r\nto 6 feet. The bedstead, table, and chair were always made by my\r\nLepchas, as described in the Tonglo excursion. The evenings I employed\r\nin writing up notes and journals, plotting maps, and ticketing the\r\nplants collected during the day’s march.\r\n\r\nI left Dorjiling at noon, on the 27th October, accompanied by Dr.\r\nCampbell, who saw me fairly off, the coolies having preceded me. Our\r\ndirect route would have been over Tonglo, but the threats of the Sikkim\r\nauthorities rendered it advisable to make for Nepal at once; we\r\ntherefore kept west along the Goong ridge, a western prolongation of\r\nSinchul.\r\n\r\nOn overtaking the coolies, I proceeded for six or seven miles along a\r\nzig-zag road, at about 7,500 feet elevation, through dense forests, and\r\nhalted at a little hut within sight of Dorjiling. Rain and mist came on\r\nat nightfall, and though several parties of my servants arrived, none\r\nof the Bhotan coolies made their appearance, and I spent the night\r\nwithout food or bed, the weather being much too foggy and dark to send\r\nback to meet the missing men. They joined me late on the following day,\r\ncomplaining unreasonably of their loads, and without their Sirdar, who,\r\nafter starting his crew, had returned to take leave of his wife and\r\nfamily. On the following day he appeared, and after due admonishment we\r\nstarted, but four miles further on were again obliged to halt for the\r\nBhotan coolies, who were equally deaf to threats and entreaties. As\r\nthey did not come up till dusk, we were obliged to encamp here, (alt.\r\n7,400 feet) at the common source of the Balasun, which flows to the\r\nplains, and the Little Rungeet, whose course is north.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the conduct of the Bhotan men and that of the\r\nLepchas and Nepalese was so marked, that I seriously debated in my own\r\nmind the propriety of sending the former back to Dorjiling, but yielded\r\nto the remonstrances of their Sirdar and the Nepal guard, who\r\nrepresented the great difficulty we should have in replacing them, and\r\nabove all, the loss of time, at this season a matter of great\r\nimportance. We accordingly started again the following morning, and\r\nstill keeping in a western direction, crossed the posts in the forest\r\ndividing Sikkim from Nepal, and descended into the Myong valley of the\r\nlatter country, through which flows the river of that name, a tributary\r\nof the Tambur. The Myong valley is remarkably fine: it runs south-west\r\nfrom Tonglo, and its open character and general fertility contrast\r\nstrongly with the bareness of the lower mountain spurs which flank it,\r\nand with the dense, gloomy, steep, and forest-clad gorges of Sikkim. At\r\nits lower end, about twenty miles from the frontier, is the military\r\nfort of Ilam, a celebrated stockaded post and cantonment of the\r\nGhorkas: its position is marked by a conspicuous conical hill. The\r\ninhabitants are chiefly Brahmins, but there are also some Moormis, and\r\na few Lepchas who escaped from Sikkim during the general massacre in\r\n1825. Among these is a man who had formerly much influence in Sikkim;\r\nhe still retains his title of Kazee,[66] and has had large lands\r\nassigned to him by the Nepalese Government: he sent the usual present\r\nof a kid, fowls, and eggs, and begged me to express to Dr. Campbell his\r\ndesire to return to his native country, and settle at Dorjiling.\r\n\r\n [66] This Mahometan title, by which the officers of state are known in\r\n Sikkim, is there generally pronounced Kajee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scenery of this valley is the most beautiful I know of in the lower\r\nHimalaya, and the Cheer Pine (_P. longifolia_) is abundant, cresting\r\nthe hills; which are loosely clothed with clumps of oaks and other\r\ntrees, bamboos, and bracken (_Pteris_). The slopes are covered with red\r\nclay, and separate little ravines luxuriantly clothed with tropical\r\nvegetation, amongst which flow pebbly streams of transparent cool\r\nwater. The villages, which are merely scattered collections of huts,\r\nare surrounded with fields of rice, buckwheat, and Indian corn, which\r\nlatter the natives were now storing in little granaries, mounted on\r\nfour posts, men, women, and children being all equally busy. The\r\nquantity of gigantic nettles (_Urtica heterophylla_) on the skirts of\r\nthese maize fields is quite wonderful: their long white stings look\r\nmost formidable, but though they sting virulently, the pain only lasts\r\nhalf an hour or so. These, however, with leeches, mosquitos, peepsas,\r\nand ticks, sometimes keep the traveller in a constant state of\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nHowever civilised the Hindoo may be in comparison with the Lepcha, he\r\npresents a far less attractive picture to the casual observer; he comes\r\nto your camping-ground, sits down, and stares with all his might, but\r\noffers no assistance; if he bring a present at all, he expects a return\r\non the spot, and goes on begging till satisfied. I was amused by the\r\ncool way in which my Ghorka guard treated the village lads, when they\r\nwanted help in my service, taking them by the shoulder, pulling out\r\ntheir knives for them, placing them in their bands, and setting them to\r\ncut down a tree, or to chop firewood, which they seldom refused to do,\r\nwhen a little such douce violence was applied.\r\n\r\nMy object being to reach the Tambur, north of the great east and west\r\nmountain ridge of Sakkiazung, without crossing the innumerable feeders\r\nof the Myong and their dividing spurs, we ascended the north flank of\r\nthe valley to a long spur from Tonglo, intending to follow winding\r\nridges of that mountain to the sources of the Pemmi at the Phulloot\r\nmountains, and thence descend.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd November I encamped on the flank of Tonglo (called Nanki in\r\nNepal), at 9,300 feet, about 700 feet below the western summit, which\r\nis rocky, and connected by a long flat ridge with that which I had\r\nvisited in the previous May. The Bhotan coolies behaved worse than\r\never; their conduct being in all respects typical of the turbulent,\r\nmulish race to which they belong. They had been plundering my\r\nprovisions as they went along, and neither their Sirdar nor the Ghorka\r\nsoldiers had the smallest authority over them. I had hired some Ghorka\r\ncoolies to assist and eventually to replace them, and had made up my\r\nmind to send back the worst from the more populous banks of the Tambur,\r\nwhen I was relieved by their making off of their own accord. The\r\ndilemma was however awkward, as it was impossible to procure men on the\r\ntop of a mountain 10,000 feet high, or to proceed towards Phulloot. No\r\ncourse remained but to send to Dorjiling for others, or to return to\r\nthe Myong valley, and take a more circuitous route over the west end of\r\nSakkiazung, which led through villages from which I could procure\r\ncoolies day by day. I preferred the latter plan, and sent one of the\r\nsoldiers to the nearest village for assistance to bring the loads down,\r\nhalting a day for that purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of Tonglo I enjoyed the view I had so long desired of\r\nthe Snowy Himalaya, from north-east to north-west; Sikkim being on the\r\nright, Nepal on the left, and the plains of India to the southward; and\r\nI procured a set of compass bearings, of the greatest use in mapping\r\nthe country. In the early morning the transparency of the atmosphere\r\nrenders this view one of astonishing grandeur. Kinchinjunga bore nearly\r\ndue north, a dazzling mass of snowy peaks, intersected by blue\r\nglaciers, which gleamed in the slanting rays of the rising sun, like\r\naquamarines set in frosted silver. From this the sweep of snowed\r\nmountains to the eastward was almost continuous as far as Chola\r\n(bearing east-north-east), following a curve of 150 miles, and\r\nenclosing the whole of the northern part of Sikkim, which appeared a\r\nbillowy mass of forest-clad mountains. On the north-east horizon rose\r\nthe Donkia mountain (23,176 feet), and Chumulari (23,929). Though both\r\nwere much more distant than the snowy ranges, being respectively eighty\r\nand ninety miles off, they raised their gigantic heads above, seeming\r\nwhat they really were, by far the loftiest peaks next to Kinchinjunga;\r\nand the perspective of snow is so deceptive, that though 40 to 60 miles\r\nbeyond, they appeared as though almost in the same line with the ridges\r\nthey overtopped. Of these mountains, Chumulari presents many\r\nattractions to the geographer, from its long disputed position, its\r\nsacred character, and the interest attached to it since Turner’s\r\nmission to Tibet in 1783. It was seen and recognised by Dr. Campbell,\r\nand measured by Colonel Waugh, from Sinchul, and also from Tonglo, and\r\nwas a conspicuous object in my subsequent journey to Tibet. Beyond\r\nJunnoo, one of the western peaks of Kinchinjunga, there was no\r\ncontinuous snowy chain; the Himalaya seemed suddenly to decline into\r\nblack and rugged peaks, till in the far north-west it rose again in a\r\nwhite mountain mass of stupendous elevation at 80 miles distance,\r\ncalled, by my Nepal people, “Tsungau.”[67] From the bearings I took of\r\nit from several positions, it is in about lat. 27° 49′ and long. 86°\r\n24′, and is probably on the west flank of the Arun valley and river,\r\nwhich latter, in its course from Tibet to the plains of India, receives\r\nthe waters from the west flank of Kinchinjunga, and from the east flank\r\nof the mountain in question. It is perhaps one which has been seen and\r\nmeasured from the Tirhoot district by some of Colonel Waugh’s party,\r\nand which has been reported to be upwards of 28,000 feet in elevation;\r\nand it is the only mountain of the first class in magnitude between\r\nGosainthan (north-east of Katmandoo) and Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\n [67] This is probably the easternmost and loftiest peak seen from\r\n Katmandoo, distant 78 miles, and estimated elevation 20,117 feet by\r\n Col. Crawford’s observations. See “Hamilton’s Nepal,” p. 346, and\r\n plate 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the west, the black ridge of Sakkiazung, bristling with pines,\r\n(_Abies Webbiana_) cut off the view of Nepal; but south-west, the Myong\r\nvalley could be traced to its junction with the Tambur about thirty\r\nmiles off: beyond which to the south-west and south, low hills\r\nbelonging to the outer ranges of Nepal rose on the distant horizon,\r\nseventy or eighty miles off; and of these the most conspicuous were the\r\nMahavarati which skirt the Nepal Terai. South and south-east, Sinchul\r\nand the Goong range of Sikkim intercepted the view of the plains of\r\nIndia, of which I had a distant peep to the south-west only.\r\n\r\nThe west top of Tonglo is very open and grassy, with occasional masses\r\nof gneiss of enormous size, but probably not in situ. The whole of this\r\nflank, and for 1000 feet down the spur to the south-west, had been\r\ncleared by fire for pasturage, and flocks of black-faced sheep were\r\ngrazing. During my stay on the mountain, except in the early morning,\r\nthe weather was bleak, gloomy, and very cold, with a high south-west\r\nwind. The mean temperature was 41°, extremes 53·2/26°: the nights were\r\nvery clear, with sharp hoar-frost; the radiating thermometer sank to\r\n21°, the temperature at 3·5 feet depth was 51·5°.\r\n\r\nA few of the Bhotan coolies having voluntarily returned, I left Tonglo\r\non the 5th, and descended its west flank to the Mai, a feeder of the\r\nMyong. The descent was as abrupt as that on the east face, but through\r\nless dense forest; the Sikkim side (that facing the east) being much\r\nthe dampest. I encamped at dark by a small village, (Jummanoo) at 4,360\r\nfeet, having descended 5000 feet in five hours. Hence we marched\r\neastward to the village of Sakkiazung, which we reached on the third\r\nday, crossing _en route_ several spurs 4000 to 6000 feet high, from the\r\nsame ridge, and as many rivers, which all fall into the Myong, and\r\nwhose beds are elevated from 2,500 to 3000 feet.\r\n\r\nThough rich and fertile, the country is scantily populated, and coolies\r\nwere procured with difficulty: I therefore sent back to Dorjiling all\r\nbut absolute indispensables, and on the 9th of November started up the\r\nridge in a northerly direction, taking the road from Ilam to\r\nWallanchoon. The ascent was gradual, through a fine forest, full of\r\nhorn-bills (_Buceros_), a bird resembling the Toucan (“Dhunass”\r\nLepcha); at 7000 feet an oak (_Quercus semecarpifolia_), “Khasrou” of\r\nthe Nepalese, commences, a tree which is common as far west as Kashmir,\r\nbut which I never found in Sikkim, though it appears again in\r\nBhotan.[68] No oak in Sikkim attains a greater elevation than 10,000.]\r\nIt forms a broad-headed tree, and has a very handsome appearance; its\r\nfavourite locality is on grassy open shoulders of the mountains. It was\r\naccompanied by an _Astragalus, Geranium,_ and several other plants of\r\nthe drier interior parts of Sikkim. Water is very scarce along the\r\nridge; we walked fully eight miles without finding any, and were at\r\nlength obliged to encamp at 8,350 feet by the only spring that we\r\nshould be able to reach. With respect to drought, this ridge differs\r\nmaterially from Sikkim, where water abounds at all elevations; and the\r\ncause is obviously its position to the westward of the great ridge of\r\nSingalelah (including Tonglo) by which the S.W. currents are drained of\r\ntheir moisture. Here again, the east flank was much the dampest and\r\nmost luxuriantly wooded.\r\n\r\n [68] This oak ascends in the N.W. Himalaya to the highest limit of\r\n forest (12,000 feet).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile my men encamped on a very narrow ridge, I ascended a rocky\r\nsummit, composed of great blocks of gneiss, from which I obtained a\r\nsuperb view to the westward. Immediately below a fearfully sudden\r\ndescent, ran the Daomy River, bounded on the opposite side by another\r\nparallel ridge of Sakkiazung, enclosing, with that on which I stood, a\r\ngulf from 6000 to 7000 feet deep, of wooded ridges, which, as it were,\r\nradiated outwards as they ascended upwards in rocky spurs to the\r\npine-clad peaks around. To the south-west, in the extreme distance,\r\nwere the boundless plains of India, upwards of 100 miles off, with the\r\nCosi meandering through them like a silver thread.\r\n\r\nThe firmament appeared of a pale steel blue, and a broad low arch\r\nspanned the horizon, bounded by a line of little fleecy clouds\r\n(moutons); below this the sky was of a golden yellow, while in\r\nsuccessively deeper strata, many belts or ribbons of vapour appeared to\r\npress upon the plains, the lowest of which was of a dark leaden hue,\r\nthe upper more purple, and vanishing into the pale yellow above. Though\r\nwell defined, there was no abrupt division between the belts, and the\r\nlowest mingled imperceptibly with the hazy horizon. Gradually the\r\ngolden lines grew dim, and the blues and purples gained depth of\r\ncolour; till the sun set behind the dark-blue peaked mountains in a\r\nflood of crimson and purple, sending broad beams of grey shade and\r\npurple light up to the zenith, and all around. As evening advanced, a\r\nsudden chill succeeded, and mists rapidly formed immediately below me\r\nin little isolated clouds, which coalesced and spread out like a\r\nheaving and rolling sea, leaving nothing above their surface but the\r\nridges and spurs of the adjacent mountains. These rose like capes,\r\npromontories, and islands, of the darkest leaden hue, bristling with\r\npines, and advancing boldly into the snowy white ocean, or starting\r\nfrom its bed in the strongest relief. As darkness came on, and the\r\nstars arose, a light fog gathered round me, and I quitted with\r\nreluctance one of the most impressive and magic scenes I ever beheld.\r\n\r\nReturning to my tent, I was interested in observing how well my\r\nfollowers had accommodated themselves to their narrow circumstances.\r\nTheir fires gleamed everywhere amongst the trees, and the people,\r\nbroken up into groups of five, presented an interesting picture of\r\nnative, savage, and half-civilised life. I wandered amongst them in the\r\ndarkness, and watched unseen their operations; some were cooking, with\r\ntheir rude bronzed faces lighted up by the ruddy glow, as they peered\r\ninto the pot, stirring the boiling rice with one hand, while with the\r\nother they held back their long tangled hair. Others were bringing\r\nwater from the spring below, some gathering sprigs of fragrant\r\n_Artemisia_ and other shrubs to form couches—some lopping branches of\r\nlarger trees to screen them from nocturnal radiation; their only\r\nprotection from the dew being such branches stuck in the ground, and\r\nslanting over their procumbent forms. The Bhotanese were rude and\r\nboisterous in their pursuits, constantly complaining to the Sirdars,\r\nand wrangling over their meals. The Ghorkas were sprightly, combing\r\ntheir raven hair, telling interminably long stories, of which money was\r\nthe burthen, or singing Hindoo songs through their noses in chorus; and\r\nbeing neater and better dressed, and having a servant to cook their\r\nfood, they seemed quite the gentlemen of the party. Still the Lepcha\r\nwas the most attractive, the least restrained, and the most natural in\r\nall his actions, the simplest in his wants and appliances, with a\r\nbamboo as his water-jug, an earthen-pot as his kettle, and all manner\r\nof herbs collected during the day’s march to flavour his food.\r\n\r\nMy tent was made of a blanket thrown over the limb of a tree; to this\r\nothers were attached, and the whole was supported on a frame like a\r\nhouse. One half was occupied by my bedstead, beneath which was stowed\r\nmy box of clothes, while my books and writing materials were placed\r\nunder the table. The barometer hung in the most out-of-the-way corner,\r\nand my other instruments all around. A small candle was burning in a\r\nglass shade, to keep the draught and insects from the light, and I had\r\nthe comfort of seeing the knife, fork, and spoon laid on a white\r\nnapkin, as I entered my snug little house, and flung myself on the\r\nelastic couch to ruminate on the proceedings of the day, and speculate\r\non those of the morrow, while waiting for my meal, which usually\r\nconsisted of stewed meat and rice, with biscuits and tea. My\r\nthermometers (wet and dry bulb, and minimum) hung under a temporary\r\ncanopy made of thickly plaited bamboo and leaves close to the tent, and\r\nthe cooking was performed by my servant under a tree.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner my occupations were to ticket and put away the plants\r\ncollected during the day, write up journals, plot maps, and take\r\nobservations till 10 p.m. As soon as I was in bed, one of the Nepal\r\nsoldiers was accustomed to enter, spread his blanket on the ground, and\r\nsleep there as my guard. In the morning the collectors were set to\r\nchange the plant-papers, while I explored the neighbourhood, and having\r\ntaken observations and breakfasted, we were ready to start at 10 a.m.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same ridge, after a few miles of ascent over much broken\r\ngneiss rock, the Ghorkas led me aside to the top of a knoll, 9,300 feet\r\nhigh, covered with stunted bushes, and commanding a splendid view to\r\nthe west, of the broad, low, well cultivated valley of the Tambur, and\r\nthe extensive town of Dunkotah on its banks, about twenty-five miles\r\noff; the capital of this part of Nepal, and famous for its manufactory\r\nof paper from the bark of the _Daphne._ Hence too I gained a fine view\r\nof the plains of India, including the course of the Cosi river, which,\r\nreceiving the Arun and Tambur, debouches into the Ganges opposite\r\nColgongl (see p. 95).\r\n\r\nA little further on we crossed the main ridge of Sakkiazung, a long\r\nflexuous chain stretching for miles to the westward from Phulloot on\r\nSingalelah, and forming the most elevated and conspicuous transverse\r\nrange in this part of Nepal: its streams flow south to the Myong, and\r\nnorth to feeders of the Tambur. Silver firs (_Abies Webbiana_) are\r\nfound on all the summits; but to my regret none occurred in our path,\r\nwhich led just below their limit (10,000 feet), on the southern\r\nHimalayan ranges. There were, however, a few yews, exactly like the\r\nEnglish. The view that opened on cresting this range was again\r\nmagnificent, of Kinchinjunga, the western snows of Nepal, and the\r\nvalley of the Tambur winding amongst wooded and cultivated hills to a\r\nlong line of black-peaked, rugged mountains, sparingly snowed, which\r\nintervene between Kinchinjunga and the great Nepal mountain before\r\nmentioned. The extremely varied colouring on the infinite number of\r\nhill-slopes that everywhere intersected the Tambur valley was very\r\npleasing. For fully forty miles to the northward there were no lofty\r\nforest-clad mountains, nor any apparently above 4000 to 5000 feet:\r\nvillages and hamlets appeared everywhere, with crops of golden mustard\r\nand purple buckwheat in full flower; yellow rice and maize, green hemp,\r\npulse, radishes, and barley, and brown millet. Here and there deep\r\ngroves of oranges, the broad-leafed banana, and sugar-cane, skirted the\r\nbottoms of the valleys, through which the streams were occasionally\r\nseen, rushing in white foam over their rocky beds. It was a goodly\r\nsight to one who had for his only standard of comparison the view from\r\nSinchul, of the gloomy forest-clad ranges of 6000 to 10,000 feet, that\r\nintervene between that mountain and the snowy girdle of Sikkim; though\r\nI question whether a traveller from more favoured climes would see more\r\nin this, than a thinly inhabited country, with irregular patches of\r\npoor cultivation, a vast amount of ragged forest on low hills of rather\r\nuniform height and contour, relieved by a dismal back-ground of\r\nfrowning black mountains, sprinkled with snow! Kinchinjunga was again\r\nthe most prominent object to the north-east, with its sister peaks of\r\nKubra (24,005 feet), and Junnoo (25,312 feet). All these presented bare\r\ncliff’s for several thousand feet below their summits, composed of\r\nwhite rock with a faint pink tint:—on the other hand the lofty Nepal\r\nmountain in the far west presented cliffs of black rocks. From the\r\nsummit two routes to the Tambur presented themselves; one, the main\r\nroad, led west and south along the ridge, and then turned north,\r\ndescending to the river; the other was shorter, leading abruptly down\r\nto the Pemmi river, and thence along its banks, west to the Tambur. I\r\nchose the latter.\r\n\r\nThe descent was very abrupt on the first day, from 9,500 feet to 5000\r\nfeet, and on that following to the bed of the Pemmi, at 2000 feet; and\r\nthe road was infamously bad, generally consisting of a narrow, winding,\r\nrocky path among tangled shrubs and large boulders, brambles, nettles,\r\nand thorny bushes, often in the bed of the torrent, or crossing spurs\r\ncovered with forest, round whose bases it flowed. A little cultivation\r\nwas occasionally met with on the narrow flat pebbly terraces which\r\nfringed the stream, usually of rice, and sometimes of the small-leaved\r\nvariety of hemp (_Cannabis_), grown as a narcotic.\r\n\r\nThe rocks above 5000 feet were gneiss; below this, cliffs of very\r\nmicaceous schist were met with, having a north-west strike, and being\r\noften vertical; the boulders again were always of gneiss. The streams\r\nseemed rather to occupy faults, than to have eroded courses for\r\nthemselves; their beds were invariably rocky or pebbly, and the waters\r\nwhite and muddy from the quantity of alumina. In one little rocky dell\r\nthe water gushed through a hole in a soft stratum in the gneiss; a\r\ntrifling circumstance which was not lost upon the crafty Brahmins, who\r\nhad cut a series of regular holes for the water, ornamented the rocks\r\nwith red paint, and a row of little iron tridents of Siva, and\r\ndedicated the whole to Mahadeo.\r\n\r\nIn some spots the vegetation was exceedingly fine, and several large\r\ntrees occurred: I measured a Toon (_Cedrela_) thirty feet in girth at\r\nfive feet above the ground. The skirts of the forest were adorned with\r\nnumerous jungle flowers, rice crops, blue _Acanthaceæ_ and _Pavetta,_\r\nwild cherry-trees covered with scarlet blossoms, and trees of the\r\npurple and lilac _Bauhinia_; while _Thunbergia, Convolvulus,_ and other\r\nclimbers, hung in graceful festoons from the boughs, and on the dry\r\nmicaceous rocks the _Luculia gratissima,_ one of our common hot-house\r\nornaments, grew in profusion, its gorgeous heads of blossoms scenting\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the Pemmi and Khawa rivers, there are high rocks of\r\nmica-slate, and broad river-terraces of stratified sand and pebbles,\r\napparently alternating with deposits of shingle. On this hot, open\r\nexpanse, elevated 2250 feet, appeared many trees and plants of the\r\nTerai and plains, as pomegranate, peepul, and sal; with extensive\r\nfields of cotton, indigo, and irrigated rice.\r\n\r\nWe followed the north bank of the Khawa, which runs westerly through a\r\ngorge, between high cliffs of chlorite, containing thick beds of\r\nstratified quartz. At the angles of the river broad terraces are\r\nformed, fifteen to thirty feet above its bed, similar to those just\r\nmentioned, and planted with rows of _Acacia Serissa,_ or laid out in\r\nrice fields, or sugar plantations.\r\n\r\nI reached the east bank of the Tambur, on the 13th of November, at its\r\njunction with the Khawa, in a deep gorge. It formed a grand stream,\r\nlarger than the Teesta, of a pale, sea-green, muddy colour, and flowed\r\nrapidly with a strong ripple, but no foam; it rises six feet in the\r\nrains, but ice never descends nearly so low; its breadth was sixty to\r\neighty yards, its temperature 55° to 58°. The breadth of the foaming\r\nKhawa was twelve to fifteen yards, and its temperature 56·5°. The\r\nsurrounding vegetation was entirely tropical, consisting of scrubby sal\r\ntrees, acacia, _Grislea, Emblica, Hibiscus,_ etc.; the elevation being\r\nbut 1,300 feet, though the spot was twenty-five miles in a straight\r\nline from the plains. I camped at the fork of the rivers, on a fine\r\nterrace fifty feet above the water, about seventy yards long, and one\r\nhundred broad, quite flat-topped, and composed of shingle, gravel,\r\netc., with enormous boulders of gneiss, quartz, and hornstone, much\r\nwater-worn; it was girt by another broken terrace, twelve feet or so\r\nabove the water, and covered with long grass and bushes.\r\n\r\nThe main road from Ilam to Wallanchoon, which I quitted on Sakkiazung,\r\ndescends steeply on the opposite bank of the river, which I crossed in\r\na canoe formed of a hollow trunk (of Toon), thirty feet long. There is\r\nconsiderable traffic along this road; and I was visited by numbers of\r\nnatives, all Hindoos, who coolly squatted before my tent-door, and\r\nstared with their large black, vacant, lustrous eyes: they appear\r\nsingularly indolent, and great beggars.\r\n\r\nThe land seems highly favoured by nature, and the population, though so\r\nscattered, is in reality considerable, the varied elevation giving a\r\nlarge surface; but the natives care for no more than will satisfy their\r\nimmediate wants. The river swarms with fish, but they are too lazy to\r\ncatch them, and they have seldom anything better to give or sell\r\n\r\nthan sticks of sugar-cane, which when peeled form a refreshing morsel\r\nin these scorching marches. They have few and poor oranges, citrons,\r\nand lemons, very bad plantains, and but little else;—eggs, fowls, and\r\nmilk are all scarce. Horned cattle are of course never killed by\r\nHindoos, and it was but seldom that I could replenish my larder with a\r\nkid. Potatos are unknown, but my Sepoys often brought me large coarse\r\nradishes and legumes.\r\n\r\nFrom the junction of the rivers the road led up the Tambur to Mywa\r\nGuola; about sixteen miles by the river, but fully thirty-five, as we\r\nwound, ascended, and descended, during three days’ marches. We were\r\nferried across the stream in a canoe much ruder than that of the New\r\nZealander. I watched my party crossing by boat-loads of fifteen each;\r\nthe Bhotan men hung little scraps of rags on the bushes before\r\nembarking, the votive offerings of a Booddhist throughout central\r\nAsia;—the Lepcha, less civilised, scooped up a little water in the palm\r\nof his hand, and scattered it about, invoking the river god of his\r\nsimple creed.\r\n\r\nWe always encamped upon gravelly terraces a few feet above the river,\r\nwhich flows in a deep gorge; its banks are very steep for 600 feet\r\nabove the stream, though the mountains which flank it do not exceed\r\n4000 to 5000 feet: this is a constant phenomenon in the Himalaya, and\r\nthe roads, when low and within a few hundred feet of the river, are in\r\nconsequence excessively steep and difficult; it would have been\r\nimpossible to have taken ponies along that we followed, which was often\r\nnot a foot broad, running along very steep cliffs, at a dizzy height\r\nabove the river, and engineered with much trouble and ingenuity: often\r\nthe bank was abandoned altogether, and we ascended several thousand\r\nfeet to descend again. Owing to the steepness of these banks, and the\r\nreflected\r\n\r\nheat, the valley, even at this season, was excessively hot and close\r\nduring the day, even when the temperature was below 70°, and tempered\r\nby a brisk breeze which rushes upwards from sunrise to sunset. The sun\r\nat this season does not, in many places, reach the bottom of these\r\nvalleys until 10 a.m., and is off again by 3 p.m.; and the radiation to\r\na clear sky is so powerful that dew frequently forms in the shade,\r\nthroughout the day, and it is common at 10 a.m. to find the thermometer\r\nsink from 70° in a sheltered spot, dried by the sun, to 40° in the\r\nshade close by, where the sun has not yet penetrated. Snow never falls.\r\n\r\nThe rocks throughout this part of the river-course are mica-schists\r\n(strike north-west, dip south-west 70°, but very variable in\r\ninclination and direction); they are dry and grassy, and the vegetation\r\nwholly tropical, as is the entomology, which consists chiefly of large\r\nbutterflies, _Mantis_ and _Diptera._ Snowy mountains are rarely seen,\r\nand the beauty of the scenery is confined to the wooded banks of the\r\nmain stream, which flows at an average inclination of fifty feet to the\r\nmile. Otters are found in the stream, and my party shot two, but could\r\nnot procure them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tambur River and Valley (East Nepal) from Chintam.\r\nLooking north.]\r\n\r\nIn one place the road ascended for 2000 feet above the river, to the\r\nvillage of Chingtam, situated on a lofty spur of the west bank, whence\r\nI obtained a grand view of the upper course of the river, flowing in a\r\ntremendous chasm, flanked by well-cultivated hills, and emerging\r\nfifteen miles to the northward, from black mountains of savage\r\ngrandeur, whose rugged, precipitous faces were streaked with snow, and\r\nthe tops of the lower ones crowned with the tabular-branched\r\nsilver-fir, contrasting strongly with the tropical luxuriance around.\r\nChingtam is an extensive village, covering an area of two miles, and\r\nsurrounded with abundant cultivation; the houses, which are built in\r\nclusters, are of wood, or wattle and mud, with grass thatch. The\r\nvillagers, though an indolent, staring race, are quiet and respectable;\r\nthe men are handsome, the women, though less so, often good-looking.\r\nThey have fine cattle, and excellent crops.\r\n\r\nImmediately above Chingtam, the Tambur is joined by a large affluent\r\nfrom the west, the Mywa, which is crossed by an excellent iron bridge,\r\nformed of loops hanging from two parallel chains, along which is laid a\r\nplank of sal timber. Passing through the village, we camped on a broad\r\nterrace, from sixty to seventy feet above the junction of the rivers,\r\nwhose beds are 2100 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nMywa Guola (or bazaar) is a large village and mart, frequented by\r\nNepalese and Tibetans, who bring salt, wool, gold, musk, and blankets,\r\nto exchange for rice, coral, and other commodities; and a custom-house\r\nofficer is stationed there, with a few soldiers. The houses are of\r\nwood, and well built: the public ones are large, with verandahs, and\r\ngalleries of carved wood; the workmanship is of Chinese character, and\r\ninferior to that of Katmandoo; but in the same style, and quite unlike\r\nanything I had previously seen.\r\n\r\nThe river-terrace is in all respects similar to that at the junction of\r\nthe Tambur and Khawa, but very extensive: the stones it contained were\r\nof all sizes, from a nut to huge boulders upwards of fifteen feet long,\r\nof which many strewed the surface, while others were in the bed of the\r\nriver: all were of gneiss, quartz, and granite, and had doubtless been\r\ntransported from great elevations, as the rocks _in situ_—both here and\r\nfor several thousand feet higher up the river—were micaceous schists,\r\ndipping in various directions, and at all angles, with, however, a\r\ngeneral strike to the north-west.\r\n\r\nI was here overtaken by a messenger with letters from Dr. Campbell,\r\nannouncing that the Sikkim Rajah had disavowed the refusal to the\r\nGovernor-General’s letter, and authorising me to return through any\r\npart of Sikkim I thought proper. The bearer was a Lepcha attached to\r\nthe court: his dress was that of a superior person, being a scarlet\r\njacket over a white cotton dress, the breadth of the blue stripes of\r\nwhich generally denotes wealth; he was accompanied by a sort of\r\nattache, who wore a magnificent pearl and gold ear-ring, and carried\r\nhis master’s bow, as well as a basket on his back; while an attendant\r\ncoolie bore their utensils and food. Meepo, or Teshoo (in Tibetan,\r\nMr.), Meepo, as he was usually called, soon attached himself to me, and\r\nproved an active, useful, and intelligent companion, guide, and often\r\ncollector, during many months afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation round Mywa Guola is still thoroughly tropical: the\r\nbanyan is planted, and thrives tolerably, the heat being great during\r\nthe day. Like the whole of the Tambur valley below 4000 feet, and\r\nespecially on these flats, the climate is very malarious before and\r\nafter the rains; and I was repeatedly applied to by natives suffering\r\nunder attacks of fever. During the two days I halted, the mean\r\ntemperature was 60° (extremes, 80°/41°), that of the Tambur, 53°, and\r\nof the Mywa, 56°; each varying a few° (the smaller stream the most)\r\nbetween sunrise and 4 p.m.: the sunk thermometer was 72°.\r\n\r\nAs we should not easily be able to procure food further on, I laid in a\r\nfull stock here, and distributed blankets, etc., sufficient for\r\ntemporary use for all the people, dividing them into groups or messes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nLeave Mywa—Suspension bridge—Landslips—Vegetation—Slope of\r\nriverbed—Bees’ nests—Glacial phenomena—Tibetans, clothing, ornaments,\r\namulets, salutation, children, dogs—Last Limboo village,\r\nTaptiatok—Beautiful scenery—Tibet village of\r\nLelyp—_Opuntia_—_Edgeworthia_—Crab-apple—Chameleon and\r\nporcupine—Praying machine—_Abies Brunoniana_—European plants—Grand\r\nscenery—Arrive at Wallanchoon—Scenery around—Trees—Tibet houses—Manis\r\nand Mendongs—Tibet household—Food—Tea-soup—Hospitality—Yaks and Zobo,\r\nuses and habits of—Bhoteeas—Yak-hair tents—Guobah of\r\nWalloong—Jhatamansi—Obstacles to proceeding—Climate and\r\nweather—Proceed—Rhododendrons, etc.—Lichens—_Poa annua_ and Shepherd’s\r\npurse—Tibet camp—Tuquoroma—Scenery of pass—Glaciers and\r\nsnow—Summit—Plants, woolly, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th November, we left Mywa Guola, and continued up the river to\r\nthe village of Wallanchoon or Walloong, which was reached in six\r\nmarches. The snowy peak of Junnoo (alt. 25,312 feet.) forms a\r\nmagnificent feature from this point, seen up the narrow gorge of the\r\nriver, bearing N.N.E. about thirty miles. I crossed the Mewa, an\r\naffluent from the north, by another excellent suspension bridge. In\r\nthese bridges, the principal chains are clamped to rocks on either\r\nshore, and the suspended loops occur at intervals of eight to ten feet;\r\nthe single sal-plank laid on these loops swings terrifically, and the\r\nhandrails not being four feet high, the sense of insecurity is very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe Wallanchoon road follows the west bank, but the bridge above having\r\nbeen carried away, we crossed by a plank, and proceeded along very\r\nsteep banks of decomposed chlorite schist, much contorted, and very\r\nsoapy, affording an insecure footing, especially where great landslips\r\nhad occurred, which were numerous, exposing acres of a reddish and\r\nwhite soil of felspathic clay, sloping at an angle of 30°. Where the\r\nangle was less than 15°, rice was cultivated, and partially irrigated.\r\nThe lateral streams (of a muddy opal green) had cut beds 200 feet deep\r\nin the soft earth, and were very troublesome to cross, from the\r\ncrumbling cliffs on either side, and their broad swampy channels.\r\n\r\nFive or six miles above Mywa, the valley contracts much, and the Tambur\r\n(whose bed is elevated about 3000 feet) becomes a turbulent river,\r\nshooting along its course with immense velocity, torn into foam as it\r\nlashes the spurs of rock that flank it, and the enormous boulders with\r\nwhich its bed is strewn.[69] From this elevation to 9000 feet, its\r\nsinuous track extends about thirty miles, which gives the mean fall of\r\n200 feet to the mile, quadruple of what it is for the lower part of its\r\ncourse. So long as its bed is below 5000 feet, a tropical vegetation\r\nprevails in the gorge, and along the terraces, consisting of tall\r\nbamboo, _Bauhinia, Acacia, Melastoma,_ etc.; but the steep mountain\r\nsides above are either bare and grassy, or cliffs with scattered shrubs\r\nand trees, and their summits are of splintered slaty gneiss, bristling\r\nwith pines: those faces exposed to the south and east are invariably\r\nthe driest and most grassy; while the opposite are well wooded.\r\n_Rhododendron arboreum_ becomes plentiful at 5000 to 6000 feet, forming\r\na large tree on dry clayey slopes; it is accompanied by _Indigofera,\r\nAndromeda,_ _Spiræa,_ shrubby _Compositæ,_ and very many plants absent\r\nat similar elevations on the wet outer Dorjiling ranges.\r\n\r\n [69] In some places torrents of stone were carried down by landslips,\r\n obstructing the rivers; when in the beds of streams, they were often\r\n cemented by felspathic clay into a hard breccia of angular quartz,\r\n gneiss, and felspar nodules.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the contracted parts of the valley, the mountains often dip to the\r\nriver-bed, in precipices of gneiss, under the ledges of which wild bees\r\nbuild pendulous nests, looking like huge bats suspended by their wings;\r\nthey are two or three feet long, and as broad at the top, whence they\r\ntaper downwards: the honey is much sought for, except in spring, when\r\nit is said to be poisoned by Rhododendron flowers, just as that, eaten\r\nby the soldiers in the retreat of the Ten Thousand, was by the flowers\r\nof the _R. ponticum._\r\n\r\nAbove these gorges are enormous accumulations of rocks, especially at\r\nthe confluence of lateral valleys, where they rest upon little flats,\r\nlike the river-terraces of Mywa, but wholly formed of angular shingle,\r\nflanked with beds of river-formed gravel: some of these boulders were\r\nthirty or forty yards across, and split as if they had fallen from a\r\nheight; the path passing between the fragments.[70] At first I imagined\r\nthat they had been precipitated from the mountains around; and I\r\nreferred the shingle to land-shoots, which during the rains descend\r\nseveral thousand feet in devastating avalanches, damming up the rivers,\r\nand destroying houses, cattle, and cultivation; but though I still\r\nrefer the materials of many such terraces to this cause, I consider\r\nthose at the mouths of valleys to be due to ancient glacial action,\r\nespecially when laden with such enormous blocks as are probably\r\nice-transported.\r\n\r\n [70] The split fragments I was wholly unable to account for, till my\r\n attention was directed by Mr. Darwin to the observations of\r\n Charpentier and Agassiz, who refer similar ones met with in the Alps,\r\n to rocks which have fallen through crevasses in glaciers.—See “Darwin\r\n on Glaciers and Transported Boulders in North Wales.” London, “Phil.\r\n Mag.” xxi. p. 180.\r\n\r\n\r\nA change in the population accompanies that in the natural features of\r\nthe country, Tibetans replacing the Limboos and Khass-tribes of Nepal,\r\nwho inhabit the lower region. We daily passed parties of ten or a dozen\r\nTibetans, on their way to Mywa Guola, laden with salt; several families\r\nof these wild, black, and uncouth-looking people generally travelling\r\ntogether. The men are middle-sized, often tall, very square-built and\r\nmuscular; they have no beard, moustache, or whiskers, the few hairs on\r\ntheir faces being carefully removed with tweezers. They are dressed in\r\nloose blanket robes, girt about the waist with a leather belt, in which\r\nthey place their iron or brass pipes, and from which they suspend their\r\nlong knives, chopsticks, tobacco-pouch, tweezers, tinder-box, etc. The\r\nrobe, boots, and cap are grey, or striped with bright colours, and they\r\nwear skull-caps, and the hair plaited into a pig-tail.\r\n\r\nThe women are dressed in long flannel petticoats and spencer, over\r\nwhich is thrown a sleeveless, short, striped cloak, drawn round the\r\nwaist by a girdle of broad brass or silver links, to which hang their\r\nknives, scissors, needlecases, etc., and with which they often strap\r\ntheir children to their backs; the hair is plaited in two tails, and\r\nthe neck loaded with strings of coral and glass beads, and great lumps\r\nof amber, glass, and agate. Both sexes wear silver rings and ear-rings,\r\nset with turquoises, and square amulets upon their necks and arms,\r\nwhich are boxes of gold or silver, containing small idols, or the\r\nnail-parings, teeth, or other reliques of some sainted Lama,\r\naccompanied with musk, written prayers, and other charms. All are\r\ngood-humoured and amiable-looking people, very square and Mongolian in\r\ncountenance, with broad mouths, high cheek-bones, narrow, upturned\r\neyes, broad, flat noses, and low foreheads. White is their natural\r\ncolour, and rosy cheeks are common amongst the younger women and\r\nchildren, but all are begrimed with filth and smoke; added to which,\r\nthey become so weather-worn from exposure to the most rigorous climate\r\nin the world, that their natural hues are rarely to be recognised.\r\nTheir customary mode of saluting one another is to hold out the tongue,\r\ngrin, nod, and scratch their ear; but this method entails so much\r\nridicule in the low countries, that they do not practise it to Nepalese\r\nor strangers; most of them when meeting me, on the contrary, raised\r\ntheir hands to their eyes, threw themselves on the ground, and kotowed\r\nmost decorously, bumping their foreheads three times on the ground;\r\neven the women did this on several occasions. On rising, they begged\r\nfor a bucksheesh, which I gave in tobacco or snuff, of which they are\r\nimmoderately fond. Both men and women constantly spin wool as they\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibet mastiff]\r\n\r\nThese motley groups of Tibetans are singularly picturesque, from the\r\nvariety in their parti-coloured dresses, and their odd appearance.\r\nFirst comes a middle-aged man or woman, driving a little silky black\r\nyak, grunting under his load of 260 lb. of salt, besides pots, pans,\r\nand kettles, stools, churn, and bamboo vessels, keeping up a constant\r\nrattle, and perhaps, buried amongst all, a rosy-cheeked and lipped\r\nbaby, sucking a lump of cheese-curd. The main body follow in due order,\r\nand you are soon entangled amidst sheep and goats, each with its two\r\nlittle bags of salt: beside these, stalks the huge, grave, bull-headed\r\nmastiff, loaded like the rest, his glorious bushy tail thrown over his\r\nback in a majestic sweep, and a thick collar of scarlet wool round his\r\nneck and shoulders, setting off his long silky coat to the best\r\nadvantage; he is decidedly the noblest-looking of the party, especially\r\nif a fine and pure black one, for they are often very ragged,\r\ndun-coloured, sorry beasts. He seems rather out of place, neither\r\nguarding nor keeping the party together, but he knows that neither\r\nyaks, sheep, nor goats, require his attention; all are perfectly tame,\r\nso he takes his share of work as salt-carrier by day, and watches by\r\nnight as well. The children bring up the rear, laughing and chatting\r\ntogether; they, too, have their loads, even to the youngest that can\r\nwalk alone.\r\n\r\nThe last village of the Limboos, Taptiatok, is large, and occupies a\r\nremarkable amphitheatre, apparently a lake-bed, in the course of the\r\nTambur. After proceeding some way through a narrow gorge, along which\r\nthe river foamed and roared, the sudden opening out of this broad, oval\r\nexpanse, more than a mile long, was very striking: the mountains rose\r\nbare and steep, the west flank terminating in shivered masses of rock,\r\nwhile that on the right was more undulating, dry, and grassy: the\r\nsurface was a flat gravel-bed, through which meandered the rippling\r\nstream, fringed with alder. It was a beautiful spot, the clear, cool,\r\nmurmuring river, with its rapids and shallows, forcibly reminding me of\r\ntrout-streams in the highlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nBeyond Taptiatok we again crossed the river, and ascended over dry,\r\ngrassy, or rocky spurs to Lelyp, the first Bhoteea village; it stands\r\non a hill fully 1000 feet above the river, and commands a splendid view\r\nup the Yalloong and Kambachen valleys, which open immediately to the\r\neast, and appear as stupendous chasms in the mountains leading to the\r\nperpetual snows of Kinchin-junga. There were about fifty houses in the\r\nvillage, of wood and thatch, neatly fenced in with wattle, the ground\r\nbetween being carefully cultivated with radishes, buckwheat, wheat, and\r\nmillet. I was surprised to find in one enclosure a fine healthy plant\r\nof _Opuntia,_ in flower, at this latitude and elevation. A Lama, who is\r\nthe head man of the place, came out to greet us, with his family and a\r\nwhole troop of villagers; they were the same class of people as I have\r\nelsewhere described as Cis-nivean Tibetans, or Bhoteeas; none had ever\r\nbefore seen an Englishman, and I fear they formed no flattering opinion\r\nfrom the specimen now presented to them, as they seemed infinitely\r\namused at my appearance, and one jolly dame clapped her hands to her\r\nsides, and laughed at my spectacles, till the hills echoed.\r\n\r\n_Elæagnus_ was common here, with _Edgeworthia Gardneri,_[71] a\r\nbeautiful shrub, with globes of waxy, cowslip-coloured, deliciously\r\nscented flowers; also a wild apple, which bears a small austere fruit,\r\nlike the Siberian crab. In the bed of the river rice was still\r\ncultivated by Limboos, and subtropical plants continued. I saw, too, a\r\nchameleon and a porcupine, indicating much warmth, and seeming quite\r\nforeign to the heart of these stupendous mountains. From 6000 to 7000\r\nfeet, plants of the temperate regions blend with the tropical; such as\r\nrhododendron, oak, ivy, geranium, berberry, clematis, and shrubby\r\n_Vaccinia,_ which all made their appearance at Loongtoong, another\r\nBhoteea village. Here, too, I first saw a praying machine, turned by\r\nwater; it was enclosed in a little wooden house, and consisted of an\r\nupright cylinder containing a prayer, and with the words, “Om mani\r\npadmi om,” (Hail to him of the Lotus and Jewel) painted on the\r\ncircumference: it was placed over a stream, and made to rotate on its\r\naxis by a spindle which passed through the floor of the building into\r\nthe water, and was terminated by a wheel.\r\n\r\n [71] A plant allied to _Daphne,_ from whose bark the Nepal paper is\r\n manufactured. It was named after the eminent Indian botanist, brother\r\n of the late Miss Edgeworth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove this the road followed the west bank of the river; the latter was\r\na furious torrent, flowing through a gorge, fringed with a sombre\r\nvegetation, damp, and dripping with moisture, and covered with long\r\n_Usnea_ and pendulous mosses. The road was very rocky and difficult,\r\nsometimes leading along bluff faces of cliffs by wooden steps and\r\nsingle rotten planks. At 8000 feet I met with pines, whose trunks I had\r\nseen strewing the river for some miles lower down: the first that\r\noccurred was _Abies Brunoniana,_ a beautiful species, which forms a\r\nstately blunt pyramid, with branches spreading like the cedar, but not\r\nso stiff, and drooping gracefully on all sides. It is unknown on the\r\nouter ranges of Sikkim, and in the interior occupies a belt about 1000\r\nfeet lower than the silver fir (_A. Webbiana_). Many sub-alpine plants\r\noccur here, as _Lecesteria, Thalictrum,_ rose, thistles, alder, birch,\r\nferns, bcrberry, holly, anemone, strawberry, raspberry, _Gnaphalium,_\r\nthe alpine bamboo, and oaks. The scenery is as grand as any pictured by\r\nSalvator Rosa; a river roaring in sheets of foam, sombre woods, crags\r\nof gneiss, and tier upon tier of lofty mountains flanked and crested\r\nwith groves of black firs, terminating in snow-sprinkled rocky peaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tambur River at the lower limit of pines]\r\n\r\nI now found the temperature getting rapidly cooler, both that of the\r\nair, which here at 8,066 feet fell to 32° in the night, and that of the\r\nriver, which was always below 40°. It was in these narrow valleys only,\r\nthat I observed the return cold current rushing down the river-courses\r\nduring the nights, which were usually brilliant and very cold, with\r\ncopious dew: so powerful, indeed, was the radiation, that the upper\r\nblanket of my bed became coated with moisture, from the rapid\r\nabstraction of heat by the frozen tarpaulin of my tent.\r\n\r\nThe rivers here are often fringed by flats of shingle, on which grow\r\nmagnificent yews and pines; some of the latter were from 120 to 150\r\nfeet high, and had been blown down, owing to their scanty hold on the\r\nsoil. I measured one, _Abies Brunoniana,_ twenty feet in girth. Many\r\nalpine rhododendrons occur at 9000 feet, with _Astragalis_ and creeping\r\nTamarisk. Three miles below Wallanchoon the river forks, being met by\r\nthe Yangma from the north-east; they are impetuous torrents of about\r\nequal volume; the Tambur especially (here called the Walloong) is often\r\nbroken into cascades, and cuts a deep gorge-like channel.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the village of Wallanchoon on the 23rd of November. It is\r\nelevated 10,385 feet, and situated in a fine open part of the Tambur\r\nvalley, differing from any part lower down in all its natural features;\r\nbeing broad, with a rapid but not turbulent stream, very grassy, and\r\nboth the base and sides of the flanking mountains covered with\r\nluxuriant dense bushes of rhododendron, rose, berberry and juniper.\r\nRed-legged crows, hawks, wild pigeons, and finches, abounded. There was\r\nbut little snow on the mountains around, which are bare and craggy\r\nabove, but sloping below. Bleak and forbidding as the situation of any\r\nHimalayan village at 10,000 feet elevation must be, that of Wallanchoon\r\nis rendered the more so from the comparatively few trees; for though\r\nthe silver fir and juniper are both abundant higher up the valley, they\r\nhave been felled here for building materials, fuel, and export to\r\nTibet. From the naked limbs and tall gaunt black trunks of those that\r\nremain, stringy masses of bleached lichen (_Usnea_) many feet long,\r\nstream in the wind. Both men and women seemed fond of decorating their\r\nhair with wreaths of this lichen, which they dye yellow with leaves of\r\n_Symplocos._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wallanchoon village]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village is very large, and occupies a flat on the east bank of the\r\nriver, covered with huge boulders: the ascent to it is extremely steep,\r\nprobably over an ancient moraine, though I did not recognise it as such\r\nat the time. Cresting this, the valley at once opens, and I was almost\r\nstartled with the sudden change from a gloomy gorge to a broad flat and\r\na populous village of large and good painted wooden houses, ornamented\r\nwith hundreds of long poles and vertical flags, looking like the fleet\r\nof some foreign port; while a swarm of good-natured, intolerably dirty\r\nTibetans, were kotowing to me as I advanced.\r\n\r\nThe houses crept up the base of the mountain, on the flank of which was\r\na very large, long convent; two-storied, and painted scarlet, with a\r\nlow black roof, and backed by a grove of dark junipers; while the\r\nhill-sides around were thickly studded with bushes of deep green\r\nrhododendron, scarlet berberry, and withered yellow rose. The village\r\ncontained about one hundred houses, irregularly crowded together, from\r\ntwenty to forty feet high, and forty to eighty feet long; each\r\naccommodating several families. All were built of upright strong\r\npine-planks, the interstices of which were filled with yak-dung; and\r\nthey sometimes rest on a low foundation wall: the door was generally at\r\nthe gable end; it opened with a latch and string; and turned on a\r\nwooden pivot; the only window was a slit closed by a shutter; and the\r\nroofs were very low-pitched, covered with shingles kept down by stones.\r\nThe paths were narrow and filthy; and the only public buildings besides\r\nthe convents were Manis and Mendongs; of these the former are\r\nsquare-roofed temples, containing rows of praying-cylinders placed\r\nclose together, from four to six feet high, and gaudily painted; some\r\nare turned by hand, and others by water: the latter are walls\r\nornamented with slabs of clay and mica slate, with “Om Mani Padmi om”\r\nwell carved on them in two characters, and repeated _ad infinitum._\r\n\r\nA Tibetan household is very slovenly; the family live higgledy-piggledy\r\nin two or more apartments, the largest of which has an open fire on the\r\nearth, or on a stone if the floor be of wood. The pots and tea-pot are\r\nearthen and copper; and these, with the bamboo churn for the brick tea,\r\nsome wooden and metal spoons, bowls, and platters, comprise all the\r\nkitchen utensils.\r\n\r\nEvery one carries in the breast of his robe a little wooden cup for\r\ndaily use; neatly turned from the knotted roots of maple (see p. 133).\r\nThe Tibetan chiefly consumes barley, wheat, or buckwheat meal—the\r\nlatter is confined to the poorer classes—with milk, butter, curd, and\r\nparched wheat; fowls, eggs, pork, and yak flesh when he can afford it,\r\nand radishes, a few potatos, legumes, and turnips in their short\r\nseason. His drink is a sort of soup made from brick tea, of which a\r\nhandful of leaves is churned up with salt, butter, and soda, then\r\nboiled and transferred to the tea-pot, whence it is poured scalding hot\r\ninto each cup, which the good woman of the house keeps incessantly\r\nreplenishing, and urging you to drain. Sometimes, but more rarely, the\r\nTibetans make a drink by pouring boiling water over malt, as the\r\nLepchas do over millet. A pipe of yellow mild Chinese tobacco generally\r\nfollows the meal; more often, however, their tobacco is brought from\r\nthe plains of India, when it is of a very inferior description. The\r\npipe carried in the girdle, is of brass or iron, often with an agate,\r\namber, or bamboo mouth-piece.\r\n\r\nMany herds of fine yaks were grazing about Wallanchoon: there were a\r\nfew ponies, sheep, goats, fowls, and pigs, but very little cultivation\r\nexcept turnips, radishes, and potatos. The yak is a very tame, domestic\r\nanimal, often handsome, and a true bison in appearance; it is\r\ninvaluable to these mountaineers from its strength and hardiness,\r\naccomplishing, at a slow pace, twenty miles a day, bearing either two\r\nbags of salt or rice, or four to six planks of pinewood slung in pairs\r\nalong either flank. Their ears are generally pierced, and ornamented\r\nwith a tuft of scarlet worsted; they have large and beautiful eyes,\r\nspreading horns, long silky black hair, and grand bushy tails: black is\r\ntheir prevailing colour, but red, dun, parti-coloured, and white are\r\ncommon. In winter, the flocks graze below 8000 feet, on account of the\r\ngreat quantity of snow above that height; in summer they find pasturage\r\nas high as 17,000 feet, consisting of grass and small tufted _Carices,_\r\non which they browse with avidity.\r\n\r\nThe zobo, or cross between the yak and hill cow (much resembling the\r\nEnglish cow), is but rarely seen in these mountains, though common in\r\nthe North West Himalaya. The yak is used as a beast of burden; and much\r\nof the wealth of the people consists in its rich milk and curd, eaten\r\neither fresh or dried, or powdered into a kind of meal. The hair is\r\nspun into ropes, and woven into a covering for their tents, which is\r\nquite pervious to wind and rain;[72] from the same material are made\r\nthe gauze shades for the eyes used in crossing snowy passes. The bushy\r\ntail forms the well-known “chowry” or fly-flapper of the plains of\r\nIndia; the bones and dung serve for fuel. The female drops one calf in\r\nApril; and the young yaks are very full of gambols, tearing up and down\r\nthe steep grassy and rocky slopes: their flesh is delicious, much\r\nricher and more juicy than common veal; that of the old yak is sliced\r\nand dried in the sun, forming jerked meat, which is eaten raw, the\r\nscanty proportion of fat preventing its becoming very rancid, so that I\r\nfound it palatable food: it is called _schat-tcheu_ (dried meat). I\r\nnever observed the yak to be annoyed by any insects; indeed at the\r\nelevation it inhabits, there are no large diptera, bots, or gadflies to\r\ninfest it. It loves steep places, delighting to scramble among rocks,\r\nand to sun its black hide perched on the glacial boulders which strew\r\nthe Wallanchoon flat, and on which these beasts always sleep. Their\r\naverage value is from two to three pounds, but the price varies with\r\nthe season. In autumn, when her calf is killed for food, the mother\r\nwill yield no milk, unless the herdsman gives it the calf’s foot to\r\nlick, or lays a stuffed skin before it, to fondle, which it does with\r\neagerness, expressing its satisfaction by short grunts, exactly like\r\nthose of a pig, a sound which replaces the low uttered by ordinary\r\ncattle. The yak, though indifferent to ice and snow and to changes of\r\ntemperature, cannot endure hunger so long as the sheep, nor pick its\r\nway so well upon stony ground. Neither can it bear damp heat, for which\r\nreason it will not live in summer below 7000 feet, where liver disease\r\ncarries it off after a very few years.[73] Lastly, the yak is ridden,\r\nespecially by the fat Lamas, who find its shaggy coat warm, and its\r\npaces easy; under these circumstances it is always led. The wild yak or\r\nbison (D’hong) of central Asia, the superb progenitor of this animal,\r\nis the largest native animal of Tibet, in various parts of which\r\ncountry it is found; and the Tibetans say, in reference to its size,\r\nthat the liver is a load for a tame yak. The Sikkim Dewan gave Dr.\r\nCampbell and myself an animated account of the chase of this animal,\r\nwhich is hunted by large dogs, and shot with a blunderbuss: it is\r\nuntameable and horridly fierce, falling upon you with horns and chest,\r\nand if he rasps you with his tongue, it is so rough as to scrape the\r\nflesh from the bones. The horn is used as a drinking-cup in marriage\r\nfeasts, and on other grand occasions. My readers are probably familiar\r\nwith Messrs. Huc and Gabet’s account of a herd of these animals being\r\nfrozen fast in the head-waters of the Yangtsekiang river. There is a\r\nnoble specimen in the British Museum not yet set up, and another is\r\npreparing for exhibition in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.\r\n\r\n [72] The latter is, however, of little consequence in the dry climate\r\n of Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [73] Nevertheless, the yak seems to have survived the voyage to\r\n England. I find in Turner’s “Tibet” (p. 189), that a bull sent by that\r\n traveller to Mr. Hastings, reached England alive, and after suffering\r\n from languor, so far recovered its health and vigour as to become the\r\n father of many calves. Turner does not state by what mother these\r\n calves were born, an important omission, as he adds that all these\r\n died but one cow, which bore a calf by an Indian bull. A painting of\r\n the yak (copied into Turner’s book) by Stubbs, the animal painter, may\r\n be seen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. The\r\n artist is probably a little indebted to description for the appearance\r\n of its hair in a native state, for it is represented much too even in\r\n length, and reaching to too uniform a depth from the flanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these frontier districts belong to two very\r\ndifferent tribes, but all are alike called Bhoteeas (from Bhote, the\r\nproper name of Tibet), and have for many centuries been located in what\r\nis—in climate and natural features—a neutral ground between dry Tibet\r\nProper, and the wet Himalayan gorges. They inhabit a climate too cold\r\nfor either the Lepcha or Nepalese, migrating between 6000 and 15,000\r\nfeet with the seasons, always accompanied by their herds. In all\r\nrespects of appearance, religion, manners, customs, and language, they\r\nare Tibetans and Lama Booddhists, but they pay tax to the Nepal and\r\nSikkim Rajahs, to whom they render immense service by keeping up and\r\nfacilitating the trade in salt, wool, musk, etc., which could hardly be\r\nconducted without their co-operation. They levy a small tax on all\r\nimports, and trade a little on their own account, but are generally\r\npoor and very indolent. In their alpine summer quarters they grow\r\nscanty crops of wheat, barley, turnips, and radishes; and at their\r\nwinter quarters, as at Loongtoong, the better classes cultivate fine\r\ncrops of buck-wheat, millet, spinach, etc.; though seldom enough for\r\ntheir support, as in spring they are obliged to buy rice from the\r\ninhabitants of the lower regions. Equally dependent on Nepal and Tibet,\r\nthey very naturally hold themselves independent of both; and I found\r\nthat my roving commission from the Nepal Rajah was not respected, and\r\nthe guard of Ghorkas held very cheap.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Wallanchoon, I was conducted to two tents, each about\r\neight feet long, of yak’s hair, striped blue and white, which had been\r\npitched close to the village for my accommodation. Though the best that\r\ncould be provided, and larger than my own, they were wretched in the\r\nextreme, being of so loose a texture that the wind blew through them:\r\neach was formed of two cloths with a long slit between them, that ran\r\nacross the top, giving egress to the smoke, and ingress to the weather:\r\nthey were supported on two short poles, kept to the ground by large\r\nstones, and fastened by yak’s hair ropes. A fire was smoking vigorously\r\nin the centre of one, and some planks were laid at the end for my bed.\r\nA crowd of people soon came to stare and loll out their tongues at me,\r\nmy party, and travelling equipage; though very civil, and only\r\noffensive in smell, they were troublesome, from their eager curiosity\r\nto see and handle everything; so that I had to place a circle of stones\r\nround the tents, whilst a soldier stood by, on the alert to keep them\r\noff. A more idle people are not to be found, except with regard to\r\nspinning, which is their constant occupation, every man and woman\r\ncarrying a bundle of wool in the breast of their garments, which is\r\nspun by hand with a spindle, and wound off on two cross-pieces at its\r\nlower end. Spinning, smoking, and tea-drinking are their chief\r\npursuits; and the women take all the active duties of the dairy and\r\nhouse. They live very happily together, fighting being almost unknown.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival I was waited on by the Guobah (or head-man), a\r\ntall, good-looking person, dressed in a purple woollen robe, with good\r\npearl and coral ear and finger-rings, and a broad ivory ring over the\r\nleft thumb,[74] as a guard when using the bow; he wore a neat thick\r\nwhite felt cap, with the border turned up, and a silk tassel on the\r\ntop; this he removed with both hands and held before him, bowing three\r\ntimes on entering. He was followed by a crowd, some of whom were his\r\nown people, and brought a present of a kid, fowls, rice, and eggs, and\r\nsome spikenard roots (_Nardostachys Jatamansi,_ a species of valerian\r\nsmelling strongly of patchouli), which is a very favourite perfume.\r\nAfter paying some compliments, he showed me round the village. During\r\nmy walk, I found that I had a good many objections to overrule before I\r\ncould proceed to the Wallanchoon pass, nearly two days’ journey to the\r\nnorthward. In the first place, the Guobah disputed the Nepal rajah’s\r\nauthority to pass me through his dominions; and besides the natural\r\njealousy of these people when intruded upon, they have very good\r\nreasons for concealing the amount of revenue they raise from their\r\nposition, and for keeping up the delusion that they alone can endure\r\nthe excessive climate of these regions, or undergo the hardships and\r\ntoil of the salt trade. My passport said nothing about the passes; my\r\npeople, and especially the Ghorkas, detested the keen, cold, and\r\ncutting wind; at Mywa Guola, I had been persuaded by the Havildar to\r\nput off providing snow-boots and blankets, on the assurance that I\r\nshould easily get them at Walloong, which I now found all but\r\nimpossible, owing to there being no bazaar. My provisions were running\r\nshort, and for the same reason I had no present hope of replenishing\r\nthem. All my party had, I found, reckoned with certainty that I should\r\nhave had enough of this elevation and weather by the time I reached\r\nWalloong. Some of them fell sick; the Guobah swore that the passes were\r\nfull of snow, and had been impracticable since October; and the Ghorka\r\nHavildar respectfully deposed that he had no orders relative to the\r\npass. Prompt measures were requisite, so I told all my people that I\r\nshould stop the next day at Walloong, and proceed on the following on a\r\nthree days’ journey to the pass, with or without the Guobah’s\r\npermission. To the Ghorka soldiers I said that the present they would\r\nreceive, and the character they would take to their commandant,\r\ndepended on their carrying out this point, which had been fully\r\nexplained before starting. My servants I told that their pay and reward\r\nalso depended on their implicit obedience. I took the Guobah aside and\r\nshowed him troops of yaks (tethered by halters and toggles to a long\r\nrope stretched between two rocks), which had that morning arrived laden\r\nwith salt from the north; I told him it was vain to try and deceive me;\r\nthat my passport was ample, and that I should expect a guide,\r\nprovisions, and snow-boots the next day; and that every impediment and\r\nevery facility should be reported to the rajah.\r\n\r\n [74] A broad ring of this material, agate, or chalcedony, is a mark of\r\n rank here, as amongst the Man-choos, and throughout Central Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my two days’ stay at Walloong, the weather was bitterly cold: as\r\nheretofore, the nights and mornings were cloudless, but by noon the\r\nwhole sky became murky, the highest temperature (50°) occurring at 10\r\na.m. At this season the prospect from this elevation (10,385 feet), was\r\ndreary in the extreme; and the quantity of snow on the mountains, which\r\nwas continually increasing, held out a dismal promise for my chance of\r\nexploring lofty uninhabited regions. All annual and deciduous\r\nvegetation had long past, and the lofty Himalayas are very poor in\r\nmosses and lichens, as compared with the European Alps, and arctic\r\nregions in general. The temperature fluctuated from 22° at sunrise, to\r\n50° at 10 a.m.; the mean being 35°;[75] one night it fell to 64°.\r\nThroughout the day, a south wind blew strong and cold up the valley,\r\nand at sunset was replaced by a keen north blast, searching every\r\ncorner, and piercing through tent and blankets. Though the sun’s rays\r\nwere hot for an hour or two in the morning, its genial influence was\r\nnever felt in the wind. The air was never very dry, the wet-bulb\r\nthermometer standing during the day 3·75° below the dry, thus giving a\r\nmean dew-point of 30·25°. A thermometer sunk two feet stood at 44°,\r\nfully 9° above the mean temperature of the air; one exposed to the\r\nclear sky, stood, during the day, several degrees below the air in\r\nshade, and, at night, from 9° to 14·75° lower. The black-bulb\r\nthermometer, in the sun, rose to 65·75° above the air, indicating\r\nupwards of 90° difference at nearly the warmest part of the day,\r\nbetween contiguous shaded and sunny exposures. The sky, when cloudless,\r\nwas generally a cold blue or steel-grey colour, but at night the stars\r\nwere large, and twinkled gloriously. The black-glass photometer\r\nindicated 10·521 inches[76] as the maximum intensity of sunlight; the\r\ntemperature of the river close by fell to 32° during the night, and\r\nrose to 37° in the day. In my tent, the temperature fluctuated with the\r\nstate of the fire, from 26° at night to 58° when the sun beat on it;\r\nbut the only choice was between cold and suffocating smoke.\r\n\r\n [75] This gives 1° Fahr. for every 309 feet of elevation, using\r\n contemporaneous observations at Calcutta, and correcting for latitude,\r\n etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n [76] On three mornings the maxima occurred at between 9 and 10 a.m.\r\n They were, Nov. 24th, 10·509, Nov. 25th, 10·521. On the 25th, at\r\n Tuquoroma, I recorded 10·510. The maximum effect observed at Dorjiling\r\n (7,340 feet) was 10·328, and on the plains of India 10·350. The\r\n maximum I ever recorded was in Yangma valley (15,186 feet), 10·572 at\r\n 1 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a good many conferences with the Guobah, some bullying, douce\r\nviolence, persuasions, and the prescribing of pills, prayers, and\r\ncharms in the shape of warm water, for the sick of the village, whereby\r\nI gained some favour, I was, on the 25th Nov., grudgingly prepared for\r\nthe trip to Wallanchoon, with a guide, and some snow-boots for those of\r\nmy party whom I took with me.\r\n\r\nThe path lay north-west up the valley, which became thickly wooded with\r\nsilver-fir and juniper; we gradually ascended, crossing many streams\r\nfrom lateral gulleys, and huge masses of boulders. Evergreen\r\nrhododendrons soon replaced the firs, growing in inconceivable\r\nprofusion, especially on the slopes facing the south: east, and with no\r\nother shrubs or tree-vegetation, but scattered bushes of rose,\r\n_Spiræa,_ dwarf juniper, stunted birch, willow, honey-suckle, berberry,\r\nand a mountain-ash (_Pyrus_). What surprised me more than the\r\nprevalence of rhododendron bushes, was the number of species of this\r\ngenus, easily recognised by the shape of their capsules, the form and\r\nwoolly covering of the leaves; none were in flower, but I reaped a rich\r\nharvest of seed. At 12,000 feet the valley was wild, open, and broad,\r\nwith sloping mountains clothed for 1000 feet with dark-green\r\nrhododendron bushes; the river ran rapidly, and was broken into falls\r\nhere and there. Huge angular and detached masses of rock were scattered\r\nabout, and to the right and left snowy peaks towered over the\r\nsurrounding mountains, while amongst the latter narrow gulleys led up\r\nto blue patches of glacial ice, with trickling streams and shoots of\r\nstones. Dwarf rhododendrons with strongly-scented leaves (_R.\r\nanthopogon_ and _setosum_), and abundance of a little _Andromeda,_\r\nexactly like ling, with woody stems and tufted branches, gave a\r\nheathery appearance to the hill-sides. The prevalence of lichens,\r\ncommon to this country and to Scotland (especially _L. geographicus_),\r\nwhich coloured the rocks, added an additional feature to the\r\nresemblance to Scotch Highland scenery. Along the narrow path I found\r\nthe two commonest of all British weeds, a grass (_Poa annua_), and the\r\nshepherd’s purse! They had evidently been imported by man and yaks, and\r\nas they do not occur in India, I could not but regard these little\r\nwanderers from the north with the deepest interest.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents as these give rise to trains of reflection in the mind\r\nof the naturalist traveller; and the farther he may be from home and\r\nfriends, the more wild and desolate the country he is exploring, the\r\ngreater the difficulties and dangers under which he encounters these\r\nsubjects of his earliest studies in science; so much keener is the\r\ndelight with which he recognises them, and the more lasting is the\r\nimpression which they leave. At this moment these common weeds more\r\nvividly recall to me that wild scene than does all my journal, and\r\nremind me how I went on my way, taxing my memory for all it ever knew\r\nof the geographical distribution of the shepherd’s purse, and musing on\r\nthe probability of the plant having found its way thither over all\r\nCentral Asia, and the ages that may have been occupied in its march.\r\n\r\nOn reaching 13,000 feet, the ground was everywhere hard and frozen, and\r\nI experienced the first symptoms of lassitude, headache, and giddiness;\r\nwhich however, were but slight, and only came on with severe exertion.\r\n\r\nWe encountered a group of Tibetans, encamped to leeward of an immense\r\nboulder of gneiss, against which they had raised a shelter with their\r\nsalt-bags, removed from their herd of yaks, which were grazing close\r\nby. They looked miserably cold and haggard, and their little upturned\r\neyes, much inflamed and bloodshot, testified to the hardships they had\r\nendured in their march from the salt regions: they were crouched round\r\na small fire of juniper wood, smoking iron pipes with agate\r\nmouthpieces. A resting-house was in sight across the stream—a loose\r\nstone hut, to which we repaired. I wondered why these Tibetans had not\r\ntaken possession of it, not being aware of the value they attach to a\r\nrock, on account of the great warmth which it imbibes from the sun’s\r\nrays during the day, and retains at night. This invaluable property of\r\notherwise inhospitable gneiss and granite I had afterwards many\r\nopportunities of proving; and when driven for a night’s shelter to such\r\nas rude nature might afford on the bleak mountain, I have had my\r\nblankets laid beneath “the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.”\r\n\r\nThe name of Dhamersala is applied, in the mountains as in the plains of\r\nIndia, to a house provided for the accommodation of travellers, whether\r\nit be one of the beautiful caravanserais built to gratify the piety,\r\nostentation, or benevolence of a rajah, or such a miserable shieling of\r\nrough stone and plank as that of Tuquoroma, in which we took up our\r\nquarters, at 13,000 feet elevation. A cheerful fire soon blazed on the\r\nearthen floor, filling the room with the pungent odour of juniper,\r\nwhich made our eyes smart and water. The Ghorkas withdrew to one\r\ncorner, and my Lepchas to a second, while one end was screened off for\r\nmy couch; unluckily, the wall faced the north-east, and in that\r\ndirection there was a gulley in the snowy mountains, down which the\r\nwind swept with violence, penetrating to my bed. I had calculated upon\r\na good night’s rest here, which I much needed, having been worried and\r\nunwell at Wallanchoon, owing to the Guobah’s obstinacy. I had not then\r\nlearnt how to treat such conduct, and just before retiring to rest had\r\nfurther been informed by the Havildar that the Guobah declared we\r\nshould find no food on our return. To remain in these mountains without\r\na supply was impossible, and the delay, of sending to Mywa Guola would\r\nnot have answered; so I long lay awake, occupied in arranging measures.\r\nThe night was clear and very cold; the thermometer falling to 19° at 9\r\np.m., and to 12° in the night, and that by my bedside to 20°.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning (Nov. 26th) I started with a small party to\r\nvisit the pass, continuing up the broad, grassy valley; much snow lay\r\non the ground at 13,500 feet, which had fallen the previous month; and\r\nseveral glaciers were seen in lateral ravines at about the same\r\nelevation. After a couple of miles, we left the broad valley, which\r\ncontinued north-west, and struck northward up a narrow, stony, and\r\nsteep gorge, crossing an immense ancient moraine at its mouth. This\r\npath, which we followed for seven or eight miles, led up to the pass,\r\nwinding considerably, and keeping along the south-east exposures,\r\nwhich, being the most sunny, are the freest from snow. The morning was\r\nsplendid, the atmosphere over the dry rocks and earth, at 14,000 feet,\r\nvibrating from the power of the sun’s rays, whilst vast masses of blue\r\nglacier and fields of snow choked every galley, and were spread over\r\nall shady places. Although, owing to the steepness and narrowness of\r\nthe gorge, no view was obtained, the scenery was wild and very grand.\r\nJust below where perpetual snow descends to the path, an ugly carved\r\nhead of a demon, with blood-stained cheeks and goggle-eyes, was placed\r\nin a niche of rock, and protected by a glass.\r\n\r\nAt 15,000 feet, the snow closed in on the path from all sides, whether\r\nperpetual, glacial, or only the October fall, I could not tell; the\r\nguide declared it to be perpetual henceforward, though now deepened by\r\nthe very heavy October fall; the path was cut some three feet through\r\nit. Enormous boulders of gneiss cumbered the bottom of the gorge, which\r\ngradually widened as we approached its summit; and rugged masses of\r\nblack and red gneiss and mica schist pierced the snow, and stood out in\r\ndismal relief. For four miles continuously we proceeded over snow;\r\nwhich was much honey-combed on the surface, and treacherous from the\r\nicy streams it covered, into which we every now and then stumbled;\r\nthere was scarcely a trace of vegetation, and the cold was excessive,\r\nexcept in the sun.\r\n\r\nTowards the summit of the pass the snow lay very deep, and we followed\r\nthe course of a small stream which cut through it, the walls of snow\r\nbeing breast-high on each side; the path was still frequented by yaks,\r\nof which we overtook a small party going to Tibet, laden with planks.\r\nAll the party appeared alike overcome by lassitude, shortness and\r\ndifficulty of breathing, a sense of weight on the stomach, giddiness\r\nand headache, with tightness across the temples.\r\n\r\nJust below the summit was a complete bay of snow, girdled with two\r\nsharp peaks of red baked schists and gneiss, strangely contorted, and\r\nthrown up at all angles with no prevalent dip or strike, and permeated\r\nwith veins of granite. The top itself, or boundary between Nepal and\r\nTibet, is a low saddle between two rugged ridges of rock, with a cairn\r\nbuilt on it, adorned with bits of stick and rag covered with Tibetan\r\ninscriptions. The view into Tibet was not at all distant, and was\r\nentirely of snowy mountains, piled ridge over ridge; three of these\r\nspurs must, it is said, be crossed before any descent can be made to\r\nthe Chomachoo river (as the Arun is called in Tibet), on which is the\r\nfrontier fort of the Tibetans, and which is reached in two or three\r\ndays. There is no plain or level ground of any kind before reaching\r\nthat river, of which the valley is said to be wide and flat.\r\n\r\nStarting at 10 a.m., we did not reach the top till 3.30 p.m.; we had\r\nhalted nowhere, but the last few miles had been most laborious, and the\r\nthree of us who gained the summit were utterly knocked up. Fortunately\r\nI carried my own barometer; it indicated 16·206 inches, giving by\r\ncomparative observations with Calcutta 16,764 feet, and with Dorjiling,\r\n16,748 feet, as the height of the pass. The thermometer stood at 18°,\r\nand the sun being now hidden behind rocks, the south-east wind was\r\nbitterly cold. Hitherto the sun had appeared as a clearly defined\r\nsparkling globe, against a dark-blue sky; but the depth of the azure\r\nblue was not so striking as I had been led to suppose, by the accounts\r\nof previous travellers, in very lofty regions. The plants gathered near\r\nthe top of the pass were species of _Compositæ,_ grass, and _Arenaria_;\r\nthe most curious was _Saussurea gossypina,_ which forms great clubs of\r\nthe softest white wool, six inches to a foot high, its flowers and\r\nleaves seeming uniformly clothed with the warmest fur that nature can\r\ndevise. Generally speaking, the alpine plants of the Himalaya are quite\r\nunprovided with any special protection of this kind; it is the\r\nprevalence and conspicuous nature of the exceptions that mislead, and\r\ninduce the careless observer to generalise hastily from solitary\r\ninstances; for the prevailing alpine genera of the Himalaya,\r\n_Arenarias,_ primroses, saxifrages, fumitories, _Ranunculi,_ gentians,\r\ngrasses, sedges, etc., have almost uniformly naked foliage.\r\n\r\nWe descended to the foot of the pass in about two hours, darkness\r\novertaking us by the way; the twilight, however, being prolonged by the\r\nglare of the snow. Fearing the distance to Tuquoroma might be too great\r\nto permit of our returning thither the same night; I had had a few\r\nthings brought hither during the day, and finding they had arrived, we\r\nencamped under the shelter of some enormous boulders (at 13,500 feet),\r\npart of an ancient moraine, which extended some distance along the bed\r\nof the narrow valley. Except an excruciating headache, I felt no ill\r\neffects from my ascent; and after a supper of tea and biscuit, I slept\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the temperature was 28° at 6.30 a.m., and rose\r\nto 30° when the sun appeared over the mountains at 8.15, at which time\r\nthe black bulb thermometer suddenly mounted to 112°, upwards of 80°\r\nabove the temperature of the air. The sky was brilliantly clear, with a\r\nvery dry, cold, north wind blowing down the snowy valley of the pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Demon’s head]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nReturn from Wallanchoon pass—Procure a bazaar at village—Dance of\r\nLamas—Blacking face, Tibetan custom of—Temple and convent—Leave for\r\nKanglachem pass—Send part of party back to Dorjiling—Yangma\r\nGuola—Drunken Tibetans—Guobah of Wallanchoon—Camp at foot of Great\r\nMoraine—View from top—Geological speculations—Height of moraines—Cross\r\ndry lake-bed—Glaciers—More moraines—Terraces—Yangma temples—Jos, books\r\nand furniture—Peak of Nango—Lake—Arrive at\r\nvillage—Cultivation—Scenery—Potatos—State of my provisions—Pass through\r\nvillage—Gigantic boulders Terraces—Wild sheep—Lake-beds—Sun’s\r\npower—Piles of gravel and detritus—Glaciers and moraines—Pabuk,\r\nelevation of—Moonlight scene—Return to Yangma—Temperature,\r\netc.—Geological causes of phenomena in valley—Scenery of valley on\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\n\r\nI returned to the village of Wallanchoon, after collecting all the\r\nplants I could around my camp; amongst them a common-looking dock\r\nabounded in the spots which the yaks had frequented.\r\n\r\nThe ground was covered, as with heather, with abundance of creeping\r\ndwarf juniper, _Andromeda,_ and dwarf rhododendron. On arriving at the\r\nvillage, I refused to receive the Guobah, unless he opened a bazaar at\r\ndaylight on the following morning, where my people might purchase food;\r\nand threatened to bring charges against him before his Rajah. At the\r\nsame time I arranged for sending the main body of my party down the\r\nTambur, and so back to Sikkim, whilst I should, with as few as\r\npossible, visit the Kanglachem (Tibetan) pass in the adjacent valley to\r\nthe eastward, and then, crossing the Nango, Kambachen and Kanglanamo\r\npasses, reach Jongri in Sikkim, on the south flank of Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nStrolling out in the afternoon I saw a dance of Lamas; they were\r\ndisfigured with black paint[77] and covered with rags, feathers, and\r\nscarlet cloth, and they carried long poles with bells and banners\r\nattached; thus equipped, they marched through the village, every now\r\nand then halting, when they danced and gesticulated to the rude music\r\nof cymbals and horns, the bystanders applauding with shouts, crackers,\r\nand alms.\r\n\r\n [77] I shall elsewhere have to refer to the Tibetan custom of daubing\r\n the face with black pigment to protect the skin from the excessive\r\n cold and dryness of these lofty regions; and to the ludicrous\r\n imposition that was passed on the credulity of MM. Huc and Gabet.\r\n\r\n\r\nI walked up to the convents, which were long ugly buildings, several\r\nstories high, built of wood, and daubed with red and grey paint. The\r\npriests were nowhere to be found, and an old withered nun, whom I\r\ndisturbed husking millet in a large wooden mortar, fled at my approach.\r\nThe temple stood close by the convent, and had a broad low architrave:\r\nthe walls sloped inwards, as did the lintels: the doors were black, and\r\nalmost covered with a gigantic and disproportioned painting of a head,\r\nwith bloody cheeks and huge teeth; it was surrounded by myriads of\r\ngoggle eyes, which seemed to follow one about everywhere; and though in\r\nevery respect rude, the effect was somewhat imposing. The similarly\r\nproportioned gloomy portals of Egyptian fanes naturally invite\r\ncomparison; but the Tibetan temples lack the sublimity of these; and\r\nthe uncomfortable creeping sensation produced by the many sleepless\r\neyes of Boodh’s numerous incarnations is very different from the awe\r\nwith which we contemplate the outspread wings of the Egyptian symbol,\r\nand feel as in the presence of the God who says, “I am Osiris the\r\nGreat: no man hath dared to lift my veil.”\r\n\r\nI had ascended behind the village, but returned down the “via sacra,” a\r\nsteep paved path flanked by mendongs or low stone dykes, into which\r\nwere let rows of stone slabs, inscribed with the sacred “Om Mani Padmi\r\nom.”—“Hail to him of the lotus and jewel”; an invocation of Sakkya, who\r\nis usually represented holding a lotus flower with a jewel in it.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, a scanty supply of vcry dirty rice was\r\nproduced, at a very high price. I had, however, so divided my party as\r\nnot to require a great amount of food, intending to send most of the\r\npeople back by the Tambur to Dorjiling. I kept nineteen persons in all,\r\nselecting the most willing, as it was evident the journey at this\r\nseason would be one of great hardship: we took seven days’ food, which\r\nwas as much as they could carry. At noon, I left Wallanchoon, and\r\nmustered my party at the junction of the Tambur and Yangma, whence I\r\ndismissed the party for Dorjiling, with my collections of plants,\r\nminerals, etc., and proceeded with the chosen ones to ascend the Yangma\r\nriver. The scenery was wild and very grand, our path lying through a\r\nnarrow gorge, choked with pine trees, down which the river roared in a\r\nfurious torrent; while the mountains on each side were crested with\r\ncastellated masses of rock, and sprinkled with snow. The road was very\r\nbad, often up ladders, and along planks lashed to the faces of\r\nprecipices, and over-hanging the torrent, which it crossed several\r\ntimes by plank bridges. By dark we arrived at Yangma Guola, a\r\ncollection of empty wood huts buried in the rocky forest-clad valley,\r\nand took possession of a couple. They were well built, raised on posts,\r\nwith a stage and ladder at the gable end, and consisted of one\r\ngood-sized apartment. Around was abundance of dock, together with three\r\ncommon English plants.[78]\r\n\r\n [78] _Cardamine hirsuta, Limosella aquatica,_ and _Juncus bufonius._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was calm, misty, and warm (Max. 41·5°, Min. 29°) for the\r\nelevation (9,300 feet). During the night, I was startled out of my\r\nsleep by a blaze of light, and jumping up, found myself in presence of\r\na party of most sinister-looking, black, ragged Tibetans, armed with\r\nhuge torches of pine, that filled the room with flame and pitchy smoke.\r\nI remembered their arriving just before dark, and their weapons\r\ndispelled my fears, for they came armed with bamboo jugs of Murwa beer,\r\nand were very drunk and very amiable: they grinned, nodded, kotowed,\r\nlolled out their tongues, and scratched their ears in the most\r\nseductive manner, then held out their jugs, and besought me by words\r\nand gestures to drink and be happy too. I awoke my servant (always a\r\nwork of difficulty), and with some trouble ejected the visitors,\r\nhappily without setting the house on fire. I heard them toppling head\r\nover heels down the stair, which I afterwards had drawn up to prevent\r\nfurther intrusion, and in spite of their drunken orgies, was soon\r\nlulled to sleep again by the music of the roaring river.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th November, I continued my course north up the Yangma valley,\r\nwhich after five miles opened considerably, the trees disappearing, and\r\nthe river flowing more tranquilly, and through a broader valley, when\r\nabove 11,000 feet elevation. The Guobah of Wallanchoon overtook us on\r\nthe road; on his way, he said, to collect the revenues at Yangma\r\nvillage, but in reality to see what I was about. He owns five\r\nconsiderable villages, and is said to pay a tax of 6000 rupees (600\r\npounds) to the Rajah of Nepal: this is no doubt a great exaggeration,\r\nbut the revenues of such a position, near a pass frequented almost\r\nthroughout the year, must be considerable. Every yak going and coming\r\nis said to pay l_s_., and every horse 4_s_.; cattle, sheep, ponies,\r\nland, and wool are all taxed; he exports also quantities of timber to\r\nTibet, and various articles from the plains of India. He joined my\r\nparty and halted where I did, had his little Chinese rug spread, and\r\nsquatted cross-legged on it, whilst his servant prepared his brick tea\r\nwith salt, butter, and soda, of which he partook, snuffed, smoked, rose\r\nup, had all his traps repacked, and was off again.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at a most remarkable place: the valley was broad, with\r\nlittle vegetation but stunted tree-junipers: rocky snow-topped\r\nmountains rose on either side, bleak, bare, and rugged; and in front,\r\nclose above my tent, was a gigantic wall of rocks, piled—as if by the\r\nTitans—completely across the valley, for about three-quarters of a\r\nmile. This striking phenomenon had excited all my curiosity on first\r\nobtaining a view of it. The path, I found, led over it, close under its\r\nwest end, and wound amongst the enormous detached fragments of which it\r\nwas formed, and which were often eighty feet square: all were of gneiss\r\nand schist, with abundance of granite in blocks and veins. A superb\r\nview opened from the top, revealing its nature to be a vast moraine,\r\nfar below the influence of any existing glaciers, but which at some\r\nantecedent period had been thrown across by a glacier descending to\r\n10,000 feet, from a lateral valley on the east flank. Standing on the\r\ntop, and looking south, was the Yangma valley (up which I had come),\r\ngradually contracting to a defile, girdled by snow-tipped mountains,\r\nwhose rocky flanks mingled with the black pine forest below. Eastward\r\nthe moraine stretched south of the lateral valley, above which towered\r\nthe snowy peak of Nango, tinged rosy red, and sparkling in the rays of\r\nthe setting sun: blue glaciers peeped from every gulley on its side,\r\nbut these were 2000 to 3000 feet above this moraine; they were small\r\ntoo, and their moraines were mere gravel, compared with this. Many\r\nsmaller consecutive moraines, also, were evident along the bottom of\r\nthat lateral valley, from this great one up to the existing glaciers.\r\nLooking up the Yangma was a flat grassy plain, hemmed in by mountains,\r\nand covered with other stupendous moraines, which rose ridge behind\r\nridge, and cut off the view of all but the mountain tops to the north.\r\nThe river meandered through the grassy plain (which appeared a mile and\r\na half broad at the utmost, and perhaps as long), and cut through the\r\ngreat moraine on its eastern side, just below the junction of the\r\nstream from the glacial valley, which, at the lower part of its course,\r\nflowed over a broad steep shingle bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Moraine thrown across the Yangma Valley, East\r\nNepal]\r\n\r\nI descended to my camp, full of anxious anticipations for the morrow;\r\nwhile the novelty of the scene, and its striking character, the\r\ncomplexity of the phenomena, the lake-bed, the stupendous ice-deposited\r\nmoraine, and its remoteness from any existing ice, the broad valley and\r\nopen character of the country, were all marked out as so many problems\r\nsuddenly conjured up for my unaided solution, and kept me awake for\r\nmany hours. I had never seen a glacier or moraine on land before, but\r\nbeing familiar with sea ice and berg transport, from voyaging in the\r\nSouth Polar regions, I was strongly inclined to attribute the formation\r\nof this moraine to a period when a glacial ocean stood high on the\r\nHimalaya, made fiords of the valleys, and floated bergs laden with\r\nblocks from the lateral gulleys, which the winds and currents would\r\ndeposit along certain lines. On the following morning I carried a\r\nbarometer to the top of the moraine, which proved to be upwards of 700\r\nfeet above the floor of the valley, and 400 above the dry lake-bed\r\nwhich it bounded, and to which we descended on our route up the valley.\r\nThe latter was grassy and pebbly, perfectly level, and quite barren,\r\nexcept a very few pines at the bases of the encircling mountains, and\r\nabundance of rhododendrons, _Andromeda_ and juniper on the moraines.\r\nIsolated moraines occurred along both flanks of the valley, some higher\r\nthan that I have described, and a very long one was thrown nearly\r\nacross from the upper end of another lateral gulley on the east side,\r\nalso leading up to the glaciers of Nango. This second moraine commenced\r\na mile and a half above the first, and abutting on the east flank of\r\nthe valley, stretched nearly across, and then curving round, ran down\r\nit, parallel to and near the west flank, from which it was separated by\r\nthe Yangma river: it was abruptly terminated by a conical hill of\r\nboulders, round whose base the river flowed, entering the dry lake-bed\r\nfrom the west, and crossing it in a south-easterly direction to the\r\nwestern extremity of the great moraine.\r\n\r\nThe road, on its ascent to the second moraine, passed over an immense\r\naccumulation of glacial detritus at the mouth of the second lateral\r\nvalley, entirely formed of angular fragments of gneiss and granite,\r\nloosely bound together by felspathic sand. The whole was disposed in\r\nconcentric ridges radiating from the mouth of the valley, and\r\ndescending to the flat; these were moraines _in petto,_ formed by the\r\naction of winter snow and ice upon the loose débris. A stream flowed\r\nover this débris, dividing into branches before reaching the lake-bed,\r\nwhere its waters were collected, and whence it meandered southward to\r\nfall into the Yangma.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient moraines in the Yangma Valley]\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the second moraine, a very curious scene opened up the\r\nvalley, of another but more stony and desolate level lake-bed, through\r\nwhich the Yangma (here very rapid) rushed, cutting a channel about\r\nsixty feet deep; the flanks of this second lake-bed were cut most\r\ndistinctly into two principal terraces, which were again subdivided\r\ninto others, so that the general appearance was that of many raised\r\nbeaches, but each so broken up, that, with the exception of one on the\r\nbanks of the river, none were continuous for any distance. We descended\r\n200 feet, and crossed the valley and river obliquely in a north-west\r\ndirection, to a small temple and convent which stood on a broad flat\r\nterrace under the black, precipitous, west flank: this gave me a good\r\nopportunity of examining the structure of this part of the valley,\r\nwhich was filled with an accumulation, probably 200 feet thick at the\r\ndeepest part, of angular gravel and enormous boulders, both imbedded in\r\nthe gravel, and strewed on the flat surfaces of the terraces. The\r\nlatter were always broadest opposite to the lateral valleys, perfectly\r\nhorizontal for the short distance that they were continuous; and very\r\nbarren; there were no traces of fossils, nor could I assure myself of\r\nstratification. The accumulation was wholly glacial; and probably a\r\nlake had supervened on the melting of the great glacier and its\r\nrecedence, which lake, confined by a frozen moraine, would periodically\r\nlose its waters by sudden accessions of heat melting the ice of the\r\nlatter. Stratified silt, no doubt, once covered the lake bottom, and\r\nthe terraces have, in succession, been denuded of it by rain and snow.\r\nThese causes are now in operation amongst the stupendous glaciers of\r\nnorth-east Sikkim, where valleys, dammed up by moraines, exhibit lakes\r\nhemmed in between these, the base of the glacier, and the flanks of the\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nYangma convents stood at the mouth of a gorge which opened upon the\r\nuppermost terrace; and the surface of the latter, here well covered\r\nwith grass, was furrowed into concentric radiating ridges, which were\r\nvery conspicuous from a distance. The buildings consisted of a wretched\r\ncollection of stone huts, painted red, enclosed by loose stone dykes.\r\nTwo shockingly dirty Lamas received me and conducted me to the temple,\r\nwhich had very thick walls, but was undistinguishable from the other\r\nbuildings. A small door opened upon an apartment piled full of old\r\nbattered gongs, drums, scraps of silk hangings, red cloth, broken\r\npraying-machines—relics much resembling those in the lumber-room of a\r\ntheatre. A ladder led from this dismal hole to the upper story, which\r\nwas entered by a handsomely carved and gilded door: within, all was\r\ndark, except from a little lattice-window covered with oil-paper. On\r\none side was the library, a carved case, with a hundred gilded\r\npigeon-holes, each holding a real or sham book, and each closed by a\r\nlittle square door, on which hung a bag full of amulets. In the centre\r\nof the book-case was a recess, containing a genuine Jos or Fo, graced\r\nwith his Chinese attribute of very long pendulous moustaches and beard,\r\nand totally wanting that air of contemplative repose which the Tibetan\r\nLamas give to their idols. Banners were suspended around, with\r\npaintings of Lhassa, Teshoo Loombo, and various incarnations of Boodh.\r\nThe books were of the usual Tibetan form, oblong squares of separate\r\nblock-printed leaves of paper, made in Nepal or Bhotan from the bark of\r\na _Daphne,_ bound together by silk cords, and placed between ornamented\r\nwooden boards. On our way up the valley, we had passed some mendongs\r\nand chaits, the latter very pretty stone structures, consisting of a\r\ncube, pyramid, hemisphere, and cone placed on the top of one another,\r\nforming together the tasteful combination which appears on the cover of\r\nthese volumes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the convents the valley again contracted, and on crossing a\r\nthird, but much lower, moraine, a lake opened to view, surrounded by\r\nflat terraces, and a broad gravelly shore, part of the lake being dry.\r\nTo the west, the cliffs were high, black and steep: to the east a large\r\nlateral valley, filled at about 1500 feet up with blue glaciers, led\r\n(as did the other lateral valleys) to the gleaming snows of Nango; the\r\nmoraine, too, here abutted on the east flank of the Yangma valley,\r\nbelow the mouth of the lateral one. Much snow (from the October fall)\r\nlay on the ground, and the cold was pinching in the shade; still I\r\ncould not help attempting to sketch this wonderfully grand scene,\r\nespecially as lakes in the Himalaya are extremely rare: the present one\r\nwas about a mile long, very shallow, but broad, and as smooth as glass:\r\nit reminded me of the tarn in Glencoe. The reflected lofty peak of\r\nNango appeared as if frozen deep down in its glassy bed, every snowy\r\ncrest and ridge being rendered with perfect precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking across Yangma Valley]\r\n\r\nNango is about 18,000 feet high; it is the next lofty mountain of the\r\nKinchinjunga group to the west of Junnoo, and I doubt if any equally\r\nhigh peak occurs again for some distance further west in Nepal. Facing\r\nthe Yangma valley, it presents a beautiful range of precipices of black\r\nrock, capped with a thick crust of snow: below the cliffs the snow\r\nagain appears continuously and very steep, for 2000 to 3000 feet\r\ndownwards, where it terminates in glaciers that descend to 14,000 feet.\r\nThe steepest snow-beds appear cut into vertical ridges, whence the\r\nwhole snowy face is—as it were—crimped in perpendicular, closely-set,\r\nzigzag lines, doubtless caused by the melting process, which furrows\r\nthe surface of the snow into channels by which the water is carried\r\noff: the effect is very beautiful, but impossible to represent on\r\npaper, from the extreme delicacy of the shadows, and at the same time\r\nthe perfect definition and precision of the outlines.\r\n\r\nTowards the head of the lake, its bed was quite dry and gravelly, and\r\nthe river formed a broad delta over it: the terraces here were perhaps\r\n100 feet above its level, those at the lower end not nearly so much.\r\nBeyond the lake, the river became again a violent torrent, rushing in a\r\ndeep chasm, till we arrived at the fork of the valley, where we once\r\nmore met with numerous dry lake-beds, with terraces high up on the\r\nmountain sides.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we reached the village of Yangma, a miserable\r\ncollection of 200 to 300 stone huts, nestling under the steep\r\nsouth-east flank of a lofty, flat-topped terrace, laden with gigantic\r\nglacial boulders, and projecting southward from a snowy mountain which\r\ndivides the valley. We encamped on the flat under the village, amongst\r\nsome stone dykes, enclosing cultivated fields. One arm of the valley\r\nruns hence N.N.E. amongst snowy mountains, and appeared quite full of\r\nmoraines; the other, or continuation of the Yangma, runs W.N.W., and\r\nleads to the Kanglachem pass.\r\n\r\nNear our camp (of which the elevation was 13,500 feet), radishes,\r\nbarley, wheat, potatos, and turnips, were cultivated as summer crops,\r\nand we even saw some on the top of the terrace, 400 feet above our\r\ncamp, or nearly 14,000 feet above the sea; these were grown in small\r\nfields cleared of stones, and protected by dykes.\r\n\r\nThe scenery, though dismal, (no juniper even attaining this elevation,)\r\nwas full of interest and grandeur, from the number and variety of snowy\r\npeaks and glaciers all around the elevated horizon; the ancient\r\nlake-beds, now green or brown with scanty vegetation, the vast\r\nmoraines, the ridges of glacial débris, the flat terraces, marking, as\r\nit were with parallel roads, the bluff sides of the mountains, the\r\nenormous boulders perched upon them, and strewed everywhere around, the\r\nlittle Boodhist monuments of quaint, picturesque shapes, decorated with\r\npoles and banners, the many-coloured dresses of the people, the\r\nbrilliant blue of the cloudless heaven by day, the depth of its\r\nblackness by night, heightened by the light of the stars, that blaze\r\nand twinkle with a lustre unknown in less lofty regions: all these were\r\nsubjects for contemplation, rendered more impressive by the stillness\r\nof the atmosphere, and the silence that reigned around. The village\r\nseemed buried in repose throughout the day: the inhabitants had already\r\nhybernated, their crops were stored, the curd made and dried, the\r\npasses closed, the soil frozen, the winter’s stock of fuel housed, and\r\nthe people had retired into the caverns of their half subterranean\r\nhouses, to sleep, spin wool, and think of Boodh, if of anything at all,\r\nthe dead, long winter through. The yaks alone can find anything to do:\r\nso long as any vegetation remains they roam and eat it, still yielding\r\nmilk, which the women take morning and evening, when their shrill\r\nwhistle and cries are heard for a few minutes, as they call the\r\ngrunting animals. No other sounds, save the harsh roar and hollow echo\r\nof the falling rock, glacier, or snow-bed, disturbed the perfect\r\nsilence of the day or night.[79]\r\n\r\n [79] Snow covers the ground at Yangma from December till April, and\r\n the falls are said to be very heavy, at times amounting to 12 feet in\r\n depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had taken three days’ food to Yangma, and stayed there as long as it\r\nlasted: the rest of my provisions I had left below the first moraine,\r\nwhere a lateral valley leads east over the Nango pass to the Kambachen\r\nvalley, which lay on the route back to Sikkim.\r\n\r\nI was premature in complaining of my Wallanchoon tents, those provided\r\nfor me at Yangma being infinitely worse, mere rags, around which I\r\npiled sods as a defence from the insidious piercing night-wind that\r\ndescended from the northern glaciers in calm, but most keen, breezes.\r\nThere was no food to be procured in the village, except a little watery\r\nmilk, and a few small watery potatos. The latter have only very\r\nrecently been introduced amongst the Tibetans, from the English garden\r\nat the Nepalese capital, I believe, and their culture has not spread in\r\nthese regions further east than Kinchinjunga, but they will very soon\r\npenetrate into Tibet from Dorjiling, or eastward from Nepal. My private\r\nstock of provisions—consisting chiefly of preserved meats from my kind\r\nfriend Mr. Hodgson—had fallen very low; and I here found to my dismay\r\nthat of four remaining two-pound cases, provided as meat, three\r\ncontained prunes, and one _“dindon aux truffes!”_ Never did luxuries\r\ncome more inopportunely; however the greasy French viand served for\r\nmany a future meal as sauce to help me to bolt my rice, and according\r\nto the theory of chemists, to supply animal heat in these frigid\r\nregions. As for my people, they were not accustomed to much animal\r\nfood; two pounds of rice, with ghee and chilis, forming their common\r\ndiet under cold and fatigue. The poorer Tibetans, especially, who\r\nundergo great privation and toil, live almost wholly on barley-meal,\r\nwith tea, and a very little butter and salt: this is not only the case\r\nwith those amongst whom I mixed so much, but is also mentioned by MM.\r\nHuc and Gabet, as having been observed by them in other parts of Tibet.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December I visited the village and terrace, and proceeded\r\nto the head of the Yangma valley, in order to ascend the Kanglachem\r\npass as far as practicable. The houses are low, built of stone, of no\r\nparticular shape, and are clustered in groups against the steep face of\r\nthe terrace; filthy lanes wind amongst them, so narrow, that if you are\r\nnot too tall, you look into the slits of windows on either hand, by\r\nturning your head, and feel the noisome warm air in whiffs against your\r\nface. Glacial boulders lie scattered throughout the village, around and\r\nbeneath the clusters of houses, from which it is sometimes difficult to\r\ndistinguish the native rock. I entered one house by a narrow low door\r\nthrough walls four feet thick, and found myself in an apartment full of\r\nwool, juniper-wood, and dried dung for fuel: no one lived in the lower\r\nstory, which was quite dark, and as I stood in it my head was in the\r\nupper, to which I ascended by a notched pole (like that in the picture\r\nof a Kamschatk house in Cook’s voyage), and went into a small low room.\r\nThe inmates looked half asleep, they were intolerably indolent and\r\nfilthy, and were employed in spinning wool and smoking. A hole in the\r\nwall of the upper apartment led me on to the stone roof of the\r\nneighbouring house, from which I passed to the top of a glacial\r\nboulder, descending thence by rude steps to the narrow alley. Wishing\r\nto see as much as I could, I was led on a winding course through, in\r\nand out, and over the tops of the houses of the village, which\r\nalternately reminded me of a stone quarry or gravel pit, and gipsies\r\nliving in old lime-kilns; and of all sorts of odd places that are\r\nturned to account as human habitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of the glacial terraces at the fork of the\r\nYangma Valley]\r\n\r\nFrom the village I ascended to the top of the terrace, which is a\r\nperfectly level, sandy, triangular plain, pointing down the valley at\r\nthe fork of the latter, and abutting against the flank of a steep,\r\nrocky, snow-topped mountain to the northward. Its length is probably\r\nhalf a mile from north to south, but it runs for two miles westward up\r\nthe valley, gradually contracting. The surface, though level, is very\r\nuneven, being worn into hollows, and presenting ridges and hillocks of\r\nblown sand and gravel, with small black tufts of rhododendron. Enormous\r\nboulders of gneiss and granite were scattered over the surface; one of\r\nthe ordinary size, which I measured, was seventy feet in girth, and\r\nfifteen feet above the ground, into which it had partly sunk. From the\r\nsouthern pointed end I took sketches of the opposite flanks of the\r\nvalleys east and west. The river was about 400 feet below me, and\r\nflowed in a little flat lake-bed; other terraces skirted it, cut out,\r\nas it were, from the side of that I was on. On the opposite flank of\r\nthe valley were several superimposed terraces, of which the highest\r\nappeared to tally with the level I occupied, and the lowest was raised\r\nvery little above the river; none were continuous for any distance, but\r\nthe upper one in particular, could be most conspicuously traced up and\r\ndown the main valley, whilst, on looking across to the eastern valley,\r\na much higher, but less distinctly marked one appeared on it. The road\r\nto the pass lay west-north-west up the north bank of the Yangma river,\r\non the great terrace; for two miles it was nearly level along the\r\ngradually narrowing shelf, at times dipping into the steep gulleys\r\nformed by lateral torrents from the mountains; and as the terrace\r\ndisappeared, or melted, as it were, into the rising floor of the\r\nvalley, the path descended upon the lower and smaller shelf.\r\n\r\nWe came suddenly upon a flock of gigantic wild sheep, feeding on scanty\r\ntufts of dried sedge and grass; there were twenty-five of these\r\nenormous animals, of whose dimensions the term sheep gives no idea:\r\nthey are very long-legged, stand as high as a calf, and have immense\r\nhorns, so large that the fox is said to take up his abode in their\r\nhollows, when detached and bleaching, on the barren mountains of Tibet.\r\nThough very wild, I am sure I could easily have killed a couple had I\r\nhad my gun, but I had found it necessary to reduce my party so\r\nuncompromisingly, that I could not afford a man both for my gun and\r\ninstruments, and had sent the former back to Dorjiling, with Mr.\r\nHodgson’s bird-stuffers, who had broken one of theirs. Travelling\r\nwithout fire-arms sounds strange in India, but in these regions animal\r\nlife is very rare, game is only procured with much hunting and trouble,\r\nand to come within shot of a flock of wild sheep was a contingency I\r\nnever contemplated. Considering how very short we were of any food, and\r\nquite out of animal diet, I could not but bitterly regret the want of a\r\ngun, but consoled myself by reflecting that the instruments were still\r\nmore urgently required to enable me to survey this extremely\r\ninteresting valley. As it was, the great beasts trotted off, and turned\r\nto tantalise me by grazing within an easy stalking distance. We saw\r\nseveral other flocks, of thirty to forty, during the day, but never,\r\neither on this or any future occasion, within shot. The _Ovis Ammon_ of\r\nPallas stands from four to five feet high, and measures seven feet from\r\nnose to tail; it is quite a Tibetan animal, and is seldom seen below\r\n14,000 feet, except when driven lower by snow; and I have seen it as\r\nhigh as 18,000 feet. The same animal, I believe, is found in Siberia,\r\nand is allied to the Big-horn of North America.\r\n\r\nSoon after descending to the bed of the valley, which is broad and\r\nopen, we came on a second dry lake-bed, a mile long, with shelving\r\nbanks all round, heavily snowed on the shaded side; the river was\r\ndivided into many arms, and meandered over it, and a fine glacier-bound\r\nvalley opened into it from the south. There were no boulders on its\r\nsurface, which was pebbly, with tufts of grass and creeping tamarisk.\r\nOn the banks I observed much granite, with large mica crystals,\r\nhornstone, tourmaline, and stratified quartz, with granite veins\r\nparallel to the foliation or lamination.\r\n\r\nA rather steep ascent of a mile, through a contracted part of the\r\nvalley, led to another and smaller lake-bed, a quarter of a mile long\r\nand 100 yards broad, covered with patches of snow, and having no\r\nlateral valley opening into it: it faced the now stupendous masses of\r\nsnow and ice which filled the upper part of the Yangma valley. This\r\nlake-bed (elevation, 15,186 feet) was strewed with enormous boulders; a\r\nrude stone hut stood near it, where we halted for a few minutes at 1\r\np.m., when the temperature was 42·2°, while the dew-point was only\r\n20·7°.[80] At the same time, the black bulb thermometer, fully exposed\r\non the snow, rose 54° above the air, and the photometer gave 10·572.\r\nThough the sun’s power was so great, there was, however, no appearance\r\nof the snow melting, evaporation proceeding with too great rapidity.\r\n\r\n [80] This indicates a very dry state of the air, the saturation-point\r\n being 0·133°; whereas, at the same hour at Calcutta it was 0·559°.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kanglachem Pass]\r\n\r\nEnormous piles of gravel and sand had descended upon the upper end of\r\nthis lake-bed, forming shelves, terraces, and curving ridges,\r\napparently consolidated by ice, and covered in many places with snow.\r\nFollowing the stream, we soon came to an immense moraine, which blocked\r\nup the valley, formed of angular boulders, some of which were fifty\r\nfeet high. Respiration had been difficult for some time, and the guide\r\nwe had taken from the village said we were some hours from the top of\r\nthe pass, and could get but a little way further; we however proceeded,\r\nplunging through the snow, till on cresting the moraine a stupendous\r\nscene presented itself. A gulf of moraines, and enormous ridges of\r\ndébris, lay at our feet, girdled by an amphitheatre of towering,\r\nsnow-clad peaks, rising to 17,000 and 18,000 feet all around. Black\r\nscarped precipices rose on every side; deep snow-beds and blue glaciers\r\nrolled down every gulley, converging in the hollow below, and from each\r\ntransporting its own materials, there ensued a complication of\r\nmoraines, that presented no order to the eye. In spite of their mutual\r\ninterference, however, each had raised a ridge of débris or moraine\r\nparallel to itself.\r\n\r\nWe descended with great difficulty through the soft snow that covered\r\nthe moraine, to the bed of this gulf of snow and glaciers; and halted\r\nby an enormous stone, above the bed of a little lake, which was snowed\r\nall over, but surrounded by two superimposed level terraces, with\r\nsharply defined edges. The moraine formed a barrier to its now frozen\r\nwaters, and it appeared to receive the drainage of many glaciers, which\r\nfiltered through their gravelly ridges and moraines.\r\n\r\nWe could make no further progress; the pass lay at the distance of\r\nseveral hours’ march, up a valley to the north, down which the glacier\r\nmust have rolled that had deposited this great moraine; the pass had\r\nbeen closed since October, it being very lofty, and the head of this\r\nvalley was far more snowy than that at Wallanchoon. We halted in the\r\nsnow from 3 to 4 p.m., during which time I again took angles and\r\nobservations; the height of this spot, called Pabuk, is 16,038 feet,\r\nwhence the pass is probably considerably over 17,000 feet, for there\r\nwas a steep ascent beyond our position. The sun sank at 3 p.m., and the\r\nthermometer immediately fell from 35° to 30·75°.[81]\r\n\r\n [81] At 4 o’clock, to 29·5°, the average dew-point was 16·3°, and\r\n dryness 0·55; weight of vapour in a cubic foot, 1·33 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter fixing in my note and sketch books the principal features of this\r\nsublime scene, we returned down the valley: the distance to our camp\r\nbeing fully eight miles, night overtook us before we got half-way, but\r\na two days’ old moon guided us perfectly, a remarkable instance of the\r\nclearness of the atmosphere at these great elevations. Lassitude,\r\ngiddiness, and headache came on as our exertions increased, and took\r\naway the pleasure I should otherwise have felt in contemplating by\r\nmoonlight the varied phenomena, which seemed to crowd upon the restless\r\nimagination, in the different forms of mountain, glacier, moraine,\r\nlake, boulder and terrace. Happily I had noted everything on my way up,\r\nand left nothing intentionally to be done on returning. In making such\r\nexcursions as this, it is above all things desirable to seize and book\r\nevery object worth noticing on the way out: I always carried my\r\nnote-book and pencil tied to my jacket pocket, and generally walked\r\nwith them in my hand. It is impossible to begin observing too soon, or\r\nto observe too much: if the excursion is long, little is ever done on\r\nthe way home; the bodily powers being mechanically exerted, the mind\r\nseeks repose, and being fevered through over-exertion, it can endure no\r\ntrain of thought, or be brought to bear on a subject.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Yangma, the thermometer never rose to 50°, it fell to\r\n14·75° at night; the ground was frozen for several inches below the\r\nsurface, but at two feet depth its temperature was 37·5°. The black\r\nbulb thermometer rose on one occasion 84° above the surrounding air.\r\nBefore leaving, I measured by angles and a base-line the elevations of\r\nthe great village-terrace above the river, and that of a loftier one,\r\non the west flank of the main valley; the former was about 400 and the\r\nlatter 700 feet.\r\n\r\nConsidering this latter as the upper terrace, and concluding that it\r\nmarks a water level, it is not very difficult to account for its\r\norigin. There is every reason to suppose that the flanks of the valley\r\nwere once covered to the elevation of the upper terrace, with an\r\nenormous accumulation of débris; though it does not follow that the\r\nwhole valley was filled by ice-action to the same depth; the effect of\r\nglaciers being to deposit moraines between themselves and the sides of\r\nthe valley they fill; as also to push forward similar accumulations.\r\nGlaciers from each valley, meeting at the fork, where their depth would\r\nbe 700 feet of ice, would both deposit the necessary accumulation along\r\nthe flanks of the great valley, and also throw a barrier across it. The\r\nmelting waters of such glaciers would accumulate in lakes, confined by\r\nthe frozen earth, between the moraines and mountains. Such lakes,\r\nthough on a small scale, are found at the terminations and sides of\r\nexisting glaciers, and are surrounded by terraces of shingle and\r\ndébris; these terraces being laid bare by the sudden drainage of the\r\nlakes during seasons of unusual warmth. To explain the phenomena of the\r\nYangma valley, it may be necessary to demand larger lakes and deeper\r\naccumulations of débris than are now familiar to us, but the proofs of\r\nglaciers having once descended to from 8000 to 10,000 feet in every\r\nSikkim and east Nepal valley communicating with mountains above 16,000\r\nfeet elevation, are overwhelming, and the glaciers must, in some cases,\r\nhave been fully forty miles long, and 500 feet in depth. The absence of\r\nany remains of a moraine, or of blocks of rock in the valley below the\r\nfork, is I believe, the only apparent objection to this theory; but, as\r\nI shall elsewhere have occasion to observe, the magnitude of the\r\nmoraines bears no fixed proportion to that of the glacier, and at\r\nPabuk, the steep ridges of débris, which were heaped up 200 feet high,\r\nwere far more striking than the more usual form of moraine.\r\n\r\nOn my way up to Yangma I had rudely plotted the valley, and selected\r\nprominent positions for improving my plan on my return: these I now\r\nmade use of, taking bearings with the azimuth compass, and angles by\r\nmeans of a pocket sextant. The result of my running-survey of the whole\r\nvalley, from 10,000 to 16,000 feet, I have given along with a\r\nsketch-map of my routes in India, which accompanies this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Skulls of Ovis ammon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nAscend to Nango mountain—Moraines—Glaciers—Vegetation—_Rhododendron\r\nHodgsoni_—Rocks—Honey-combed surface of snow—Perpetual snow—Top of\r\npass—View—Elevation—Geology—Distance of\r\nsound—Plants—Temperature—Scenery—Cliffs of granite and hurled\r\nboulders—Camp—Descent—Pheasants—Larch—Himalayan pines—Distribution of\r\nDeodar, note on—Tassichooding temples—Kambachen\r\nvillage—Cultivation—Moraines in valley, distribution of—Picturesque\r\nlake-beds, and their vegetation—Tibetan sheep and goats—_Cryptogramma\r\ncrispa_—Ascent to Choonjerma pass—View of Junnoo—Rocks of its\r\nsummit—Misty ocean—Nepal peaks—Top of pass—Temperature, and\r\nobservations—Gorgeous sunset—Descent to Yalloong valley—Loose\r\npath—Night scenes—Musk deer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe passed the night a few miles below the great moraine, in a pine-wood\r\n(alt. 11,000 feet) opposite the gorge which leads to the Kambachen or\r\nNango pass, over the south shoulder of the mountain of that name: it is\r\nsituated on a ridge dividing the Yangma river from that of Kambachen,\r\nwhich latter falls into the Tambur opposite Lelyp.\r\n\r\nThe road crosses the Yangma (which is about fifteen feet wide), and\r\nimmediately ascends steeply to the south-east, over a rocky moraine,\r\nclothed with a dense thicket of rhododendrons, mountain-ash, maples,\r\npine, birch, juniper, etc. The ground was covered with silvery flakes\r\nof birch bark, and that of _Rhododendron Hodgsoni,_ which is as\r\ndelicate as tissue-paper, and of a pale flesh-colour. I had never\r\nbefore met with this species, and was astonished at the beauty of its\r\nfoliage, which was of a beautiful bright green, with leaves sixteen\r\ninches long.\r\n\r\nBeyond the region of trees and large shrubs the alpine rhododendrons\r\nfilled the broken surface of the valley, growing with _Potentilla,_\r\nHoneysuckle, _Polygonum,_ and dwarf juniper. The peak of Nango seemed\r\nto tower over the gorge, rising behind some black, splintered, rocky\r\ncliffs, sprinkled with snow, narrow defiles opened up through these\r\ncliffs to blue glaciers, and their mouths were invariably closed by\r\nbeds of shingly moraines, curving outwards from either, flank in\r\nconcentric ridges.\r\n\r\nTowards the base of the peak, at about 14,000 feet, the scenery is very\r\ngrand; a great moraine rises suddenly to the north-west, under the\r\nprincipal mass of snow and ice, and barren slopes of gravel descend\r\nfrom it; on either side are rugged precipices; the ground is bare and\r\nstony, with patches of brown grass: and, on looking back, the valley\r\nappears very steep to the first shrubby vegetation, of dark green\r\nrhododendrons, bristling with ugly stunted pines.\r\n\r\nWe followed a valley to the south-east, so as to turn the flank of the\r\npeak; the path lying over beds of October snow at 14,000 feet, and over\r\nplashy ground, from its melting. Sometimes our way lay close to the\r\nblack precipices on our right, under which the snow was deep; and we\r\ndragged ourselves along, grasping every prominence of the rock with our\r\nnumbed fingers. Granite appeared in large veins in the crumpled gneiss\r\nat a great elevation, in its most beautiful and loosely-crystallised\r\nform, of pearly white prisms of felspar, glassy quartz, and milk-white\r\nflat plates of mica, with occasionally large crystals of tourmaline.\r\nGarnets were very frequent in the gneiss near the granite veins. Small\r\nrushes, grasses, and sedges formed the remaining vegetation, amongst\r\nwhich were the withered stalks of gentians, _Sedum, Arenaria, Silene,_\r\nand many Composite plants.\r\n\r\nAt a little below 15,000 feet, we reached enormous flat beds of snow,\r\nwhich were said to be perpetual, but covered deeply with the October\r\nfall. They were continuous, and like all the snow I saw at this season,\r\nthe surface was honeycombed into thin plates, dipping north at a high\r\nangle; the intervening fissures were about six inches deep. A thick\r\nmist here overtook us, and this, with the great difficulty of picking\r\nour way, rendered the ascent very fatiguing. Being sanguine about\r\nobtaining a good view, I found it almost impossible to keep my temper\r\nunder the aggravations of pain in the forehead, lassitude, oppression\r\nof breathing, a dense drizzling fog, a keen cold wind, a slippery\r\nfooting, where I was stumbling at every few steps, and icy-cold wet\r\nfeet, hands, and eyelids; the latter, odd as it sounds, I found a very\r\ndisagreeable accompaniment of continued raw cold wind.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour and a half’s toilsome ascent, during which we made but\r\nlittle progress, we reached the crest, crossing a broad shelf of snow\r\nbetween two rocky eminences; the ridge was unsnowed a little way down\r\nthe east flank; this was, in a great measure, due to the eastern\r\nexposure being the more sunny, to the prevalence of the warm and\r\nmelting south-east winds that blow up the deep Kambachen valley, and to\r\nthe fact that the great snow-beds on the west side are drifted\r\naccumulations.[82] The mist cleared off, and I had a partial, though\r\nlimited, view. To the north the blue ice-clad peak of Nango was still\r\n2000 feet above us, its snowy mantle falling in great sweeps and curves\r\ninto glacier-bound valleys, over which the ice streamed out of sight,\r\nbounded by black aiguilles of gneiss. The Yangma valley was quite\r\nhidden, but to the eastward the view across the stupendous gorge of the\r\nKambachen, 5000 feet below, to the waste of snow, ice, and rock, piled\r\nin confusion along the top of the range of Junnoo and Choonjerma,\r\nparallel to this but higher, was very grand indeed: this we were to\r\ncross in two days, and its appearance was such, that our guide doubted\r\nthe possibility of our doing it. A third and fourth mountain mass\r\n(unseen) lay beyond this, between us and Sikkim, divided by valleys as\r\ndeep as those of Yangma and Kambachen.\r\n\r\n [82] Such enormous beds of snow in depressions, or on gentle slopes,\r\n are generally adopted as indicating the lower limit of perpetual snow.\r\n They are, however, winter accumulations, due mainly to eddies of wind,\r\n of far more snow than can be melted in the following summer, being\r\n hence perennial in the ordinary sense of the word. They pass into the\r\n state of glacier ice, and, obeying the laws that govern the motions of\r\n a viscous fluid, so admirably elucidated by Forbes (“Travels in the\r\n Alps”), they flow downwards. A careful examination of those great beds\r\n of snow in the Alps, from whose position the mean lower level of\r\n perpetual snow, in that latitude, is deduced, has convinced me that\r\n these are mainly due to accumulations of this kind, and that the true\r\n limit of perpetual snow, or that point where all that falls melts, is\r\n much higher than it is usually supposed to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving hung up my instruments, I ascended a few hundred feet to some\r\nnaked rocks, to the northward; they were of much-crumpled and\r\ndislocated gneiss, thrown up at a very high angle, and striking\r\nnorth-west. Chlorite, schist, and quartz, in thin beds, alternated with\r\nthe gneiss, and veins of granite and quartz, were injected through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt fell calm; when the distance to which the voice was carried was very\r\nremarkable; I could distinctly hear every word spoken 300 to 400 yards\r\noff, and did not raise my voice when I asked one of the men to bring me\r\na hammer.\r\n\r\nThe few plants about were generally small tufted _Arenarias_ and woolly\r\n_Compositæ,_ with a thick-rooted Umbellifer that spread its short,\r\nfleshy leaves and branches flat on the ground; the root was very\r\naromatic, but wedged close in the rock. The temperature at 4 p.m. was\r\n23°, and bitterly cold; the elevation, 15,770 feet; dew-point, 16°. The\r\nair was not very dry; saturation-point, 0·670°, whereas at Calcutta it\r\nwas 0·498° at the same hour.\r\n\r\nThe descent was to a broad, open valley, into which the flank of Nango\r\ndipped in tremendous precipices, which reared their heads in splintered\r\nsnowy peaks. At their bases were shoots of débris fully 700 feet high,\r\nsloping at a steep angle. Enormous masses of rock, detached by the\r\naction of the frost and ice from the crags, were scattered over the\r\nbottom of the valley; they had been precipitated from above, and\r\ngaining impetus in their descent, bad been hurled to almost\r\ninconceivable distances from the parent cliff. All were of a very\r\nwhite, fine-grained crystallised granite, full of small veins of the\r\nsame rock still more finely crystallised. The weathered surface of each\r\nblock was black, and covered with moss and lichens; the others\r\nbeautifully white, with clean, sharp-fractured edges. The material of\r\nwhich they were composed was so hard that I found it difficult to\r\ndetach a specimen.\r\n\r\nDarkness had already come on, and the coolies being far behind, we\r\nencamped by the light of the moon, shining through a thin fog, where we\r\nfirst found dwarf-juniper for fuel, at 13,500 feet. A little sleet fell\r\nduring the night, which was tolerably fine, and not very cold; the\r\nminimum thermometer indicating 14·5°.\r\n\r\nHaving no tent-poles, I had some difficulty in getting my blankets\r\narranged as a shelter, which was done by making them slant from the\r\nside of a boulder, on the top of which one end was kept by heavy\r\nstones; under this roof I laid my bed, on a mass of rhododendron and\r\njuniper-twigs. The men did the same against other boulders, and\r\nlighting a huge fire opposite the mouth of my ground-nest, I sat\r\ncross-legged on the bed to eat my supper; my face scorching, and my\r\nback freezing. Rice, boiled with a few ounces of greasy _dindon aux\r\ntruffes_ was now my daily dinner, with chili-vinegar and tea, and I\r\nused to relish it keenly: this finished, I smoked a cigar, and wrote up\r\nmy journal (in short intervals between warming myself) by the light of\r\nthe fire; took observations by means of a dark-lantern; and when all\r\nthis was accomplished, I went to roost.\r\n\r\n_December 5._—On looking out this morning, it was with a feeling of awe\r\nthat I gazed at the stupendous ice-crowned precipices that shot up to\r\nthe summit of Nango, their flanks spotted white at the places whence\r\nthe gigantic masses with which I was surrounded had fallen; thence my\r\neye wandered down their black faces to the slope of débris at the\r\nbottom, thus tracing the course which had probably been taken by that\r\nrock under whose shelter I had passed the previous night.\r\n\r\nMeepo, the Lepcha sent by the rajah, had snared a couple of beautiful\r\npheasants, one of which I skinned, and ate for breakfast; it is a small\r\nbird, common above 12,000 feet, but very wild; the male has two to five\r\nspurs on each of its legs, according to its age; the general colour is\r\ngreenish, with a broad scarlet patch surrounding the eye; the Nepalese\r\nname is “Khalidge.” The crop was distended with juniper berries, of\r\nwhich the flesh tasted strongly, and it was the very hardest, toughest\r\nbird I ever did eat.\r\n\r\nWe descended at first through rhododendron and juniper, then through\r\nblack silver-fir (_Abies Webbiana_), and below that, near the river, we\r\ncame to the Himalayan larch; a tree quite unknown, except from a notice\r\nin the journals of Mr. Griffith, who found it in Bhotan. It is a small\r\ntree, twenty to forty feet high, perfectly similar in general\r\ncharacters to a European larch, but with larger cones, which are erect\r\nupon the very long, pensile, whip-like branches; its leaves,—now\r\nred—were falling, and covering the rocky ground on which it grew,\r\nscattered amongst other trees. It is called “Saar” by the Lepchas and\r\nCis-himalayan Tibetans, and “Boarga-sella” by the Nepalese, who say it\r\nis found as far west as the heads of the Cosi river: it does not\r\ninhabit Central or West Nepal, nor the North-west Himalaya. The\r\ndistribution of the Himalayan pines is very remarkable. The Deodar has\r\nnot been seen east of Nepal, nor the _Pinus Gerardiana, Cupressus\r\ntorulosa,_ or _Juniperus communis._ On the other hand, _Podocarpus_ is\r\nconfined to the east of Katmandoo. _Abies Brunoniana_ does not occur\r\nwest of the Gogra, nor the larch west of the Cosi, nor funereal cypress\r\n(an introduced plant, however) west of the Teesta (in Sikkim). Of the\r\ntwelve[83] Sikkim and Bhotan _Coniferæ_ (including yew, junipers, and\r\n_Podocarpus_) eight are common to the North-west Himalaya (west of\r\nNepal), and four[84] are not: of the thirteen natives of the north-west\r\nprovinces, again, only five[85] are not found in Sikkim, and I have\r\ngiven their names below, because they show how European the absent ones\r\nare, either specifically or in affinity. I have stated that the Deodar\r\nis possibly a variety of the Cedar of Lebanon. This is now a prevalent\r\nopinion, which is strengthened by the fact that so many more Himalayan\r\nplants are now ascertained to be European than had been supposed before\r\nthey were compared with European specimens; such are the yew,\r\n_Juniperus communis, Berberis vulgaris, Quercus Ballota, Populus alba_\r\nand _Euphratica,_ etc. The cones of the Deodar are identical with those\r\nof the Cedar of Lebanon: the Deodar has, generally longer and more pale\r\nbluish leaves and weeping branches,[86] but these characters seem to be\r\nunusually developed in our gardens; for several gentlemen, well\r\nacquainted with the Deodar at Simla, when asked to point it out in the\r\nKew Gardens, have indicated the Cedar of Lebanon, and when shown the\r\nDeodar, declare that they never saw that plant in the Himalaya!\r\n\r\n [83] Juniper, 3; yew, _Abies Webbiana, Brunoniana,_ and _Smithiana_:\r\n Larch, _Pinus excelsa,_ and _longifolia,_ and _Podocarpus neriifolia._\r\n\r\n\r\n [84] Larch, _Cupressus funebris, Podocarpus neriifolia, Abies\r\n Brunoniana._\r\n\r\n\r\n [85] A juniper (the European _communis_), Deodar (possibly only a\r\n variety of the Cedar of Lebanon and of Mount Atlas), _Pinus\r\n Gerardiana, P. excelsa,_ and _Crupressus torulosa._\r\n\r\n\r\n [86] Since writing the above, I have seen, in the magnificent Pinetum\r\n at Dropmore, noble cedars, with the length and hue of leaf, and the\r\n pensile branches of the Deodar, and far more beautiful than that is,\r\n and as unlike the common Lebanon Cedar as possible. When it is\r\n considered from how very few wild trees (and these said to be exactly\r\n alike) the many dissimilar varieties of the _C. Libani_ have been\r\n derived; the probability of this, the Cedar of Algiers, and of the\r\n Himalayas (Deodar) being all forms of one species, is greatly\r\n increased. We cannot presume to judge from the few cedars which still\r\n remain, what the habit and appearance of the tree may have been, when\r\n it covered the slopes of Libanus, and seeing how very variable\r\n _Coniferæ_ are in habit, we may assume that its surviving specimens\r\n give us no information on this head. Should all three prove one, it\r\n will materially enlarge our ideas of the distribution and variation of\r\n species. The botanist will insist that the typical form of cedar is\r\n that which retains its characters best over the greatest area, namely,\r\n the Deodar; in which case the prejudice of the ignorant, and the\r\n preconceived ideas of the naturalist, must yield to the fact that the\r\n old familiar Cedar of Lebanon is an unusual variety of the Himalayan\r\n Deodar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the valley we turned up the stream, and passing the\r\nTassichooding convents[87] and temple, crossed the river—which was a\r\nfurious torrent, about twelve yards wide—to the village of Kambachen,\r\non a flat terrace a few feet above the stream. There were about a dozen\r\nhouses of wood, plastered with mud and dung, scattered over a grassy\r\nplain of a few acres, fenced in, as were also a few fields, with stone\r\ndykes. The only cultivation consists of radishes, potatos, and barley:\r\nno wheat is grown, the climate being said to be too cold for it, by\r\nwhich is probably meant that it is foggy,—the elevation (11,380 feet)\r\nbeing 2000 feet less than that of Yangma village, and the temperature\r\ntherefore 6° to 7° warmer; but of all the mountain gorges I have ever\r\nvisited, this is by far the wildest, grandest, and most gloomy; and\r\nthat man should hybernate here is indeed extraordinary, for there is no\r\nroute up the valley, and all communication with Lelyp,[88] two marches\r\ndown the river, is cut off in winter, when the houses are buried in\r\nsnow, and drifts fifteen feet deep are said to be common. Standing on\r\nthe little flat of Kambachen, precipices, with inaccessible patches of\r\npine wood, appeared to the west, towering over head; while across the\r\nnarrow valley wilder and less wooded crags rose in broken ridges to the\r\nglaciers of Nango. Up the valley, the view was cut off by bluff cliffs;\r\nwhilst down it, the scene was most remarkable: enormous black,\r\nround-backed moraines, rose, tier above tier, from a flat lake-bed,\r\napparently hemming in the river between the lofty precipices on the\r\neast flank of the valley. These had all been deposited at the mouth of\r\na lateral valley, opening just below the village, and descending from\r\nJunnoo, a mountain of 25,312 feet elevation, and one of the grandest of\r\nthe Kinchinjunga group, whose top—though only five miles distant in a\r\nstraight line—rises 13,932 feet[89] above the village. Few facts show\r\nmore decidedly the extraordinary steepness and depth of the Kambachen\r\nvalley near the village, which, though nearly 11,400 feet above the\r\nsea, lies between two mountains only eight miles apart, the one 25,312\r\nfeet high, the other (Nango), 19,000 feet.\r\n\r\n [87] These were built by the Sikkim people, when the eastern valleys\r\n of Nepal belonged to the Sikkim rajah.\r\n\r\n\r\n [88] Which I passed, on the Tambur, on the 21st Nov. See page 204.\r\n\r\n\r\n [89] his is one of the most sudden slopes in this part of the\r\n Himalaya, the angle between the top of Junnoo and Kambachen being\r\n 2,786 feet per mile, or 1 in 1·8. The slope from the top of Mont Blanc\r\n to the Chamouni valley is 2,464 feet per mile, or 1 in 2·1. That from\r\n Monte Rosa top to Macugnaga greatly exceeds either.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe villagers received us very kindly, and furnished us with a guide\r\nfor the Choonjerma pass, leading to the Yalloong valley, the most\r\neasterly in Nepal; but he recommended our not attempting any part of\r\nthe ascent till the morrow, as it was past 1 p.m., and we should find\r\nno camping-ground for half the way up. The villagers gave us the leg of\r\na musk deer, and some red potatos, about as big as walnuts—all they\r\ncould spare from their winter-stock. With this scanty addition to our\r\nstores we started down the valley, for a few miles alternately along\r\nflat lake-beds and over moraines, till we crossed the stream from the\r\nlateral valley, and ascending a little, camped on its bank, at 11,400\r\nfeet elevation.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I botanized amongst the moraines, which were very\r\nnumerous, and had been thrown down at right-angles to the main valley,\r\nwhich latter being here very narrow, and bounded by lofty precipices,\r\nmust have stopped the parent glaciers, and effected the heaping of some\r\nof these moraines to at least 1000 feet above the river. The general\r\nfeatures were modifications of those seen in the Yangma valley, but\r\ncontracted into a much smaller space.\r\n\r\nThe moraines were all accumulated in a sort of delta, through which the\r\nlateral river debouched into the Kambachen, and were all deposited more\r\nor less parallel to the course of the lateral valley, but curving\r\noutwards from its mouth. The village-flat, or terrace, continued level\r\nto the first moraine, which had been thrown down on the upper or north\r\nside of the lateral valley, on whose and curving steep flanks it\r\nabutted, and curving outwards seemed to encircle the village-flat on\r\nthe south and west; where it dipped into the river. This was crossed at\r\nthe height of about 100 feet, by a stony path, leading to the bed of\r\nthe rapid torrent flowing through shingle and boulders, beyond which\r\nwas another moraine, 250 feet high, and parallel to it a third gigantic\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient moraines in the Kambachen Valley]\r\n\r\nAscending the great moraine at a place where it overhung the main\r\nriver, I had a good _coup-a’œil_ of the whole. The view south-east up\r\nthe glacial valley—(represented in the accompanying cut)—to the snowy\r\npeaks south of Junnoo, was particularly grand, and most interesting\r\nfrom the precision with which one great distant existing glacier was\r\nmarked by two waving parallel lines of lateral moraines, which formed,\r\nas it were, a vast raised gutter, or channel, ascending from perhaps\r\n16,000 feet elevation, till it was hidden behind a spur in the valley.\r\nWith a telescope I could descry many similar smaller glaciers, with\r\nhuge accumulations of shingle at their terminations; but this great one\r\nwas beautifully seen by the naked eye, and formed a very curious\r\nfeature in the landscape.\r\n\r\nBetween the moraines, near my tent, the soil was perfectly level, and\r\nconsisted of little lake-beds strewn with gigantic boulders, and\r\ncovered with hard turf of grass and sedge, and little bushes of dwarf\r\nrhododendron and prostrate juniper, as trim as if they had been\r\nclipped. Altogether these formed the most picturesque little nooks it\r\nwas possible to conceive; and they exhibited the withered remains of so\r\nmany kinds of primrose, gentian, anemone, potentilla, orchis,\r\nsaxifrage, parnassia, campanula, and pedicularis, that in summer they\r\nmust be perfect gardens of wild flowers. Around each plot of a few\r\nacres was the grand ice-transported girdle of stupendous rocks, many\r\nfrom 50 to 100 feet long, crested with black tabular-branched silver\r\nfirs, conical deep green tree-junipers, and feathery larches; whilst\r\namongst the blocks grew a profusion of round masses of evergreen\r\nrhododendron bushes. Beyond were stupendous frowning cliffs, beneath\r\nwhich the river roared like thunder; and looking up the glacial valley,\r\nthe setting sun was bathing the expanse of snow in the most delicate\r\nchanging tints, pink, amber, and gold.\r\n\r\nThe boulders forming the moraine were so enormous and angular, that I\r\nhad great difficulty in ascending it. I saw some pheasants feeding on\r\nthe black berries of the juniper, but where the large rhododendrons\r\ngrew amongst the rocks I found it impossible to penetrate. The largest\r\nof the moraines is piled to upwards of 1000 feet against the south\r\nflank of the lateral valley, and stretched far up it beyond my camp,\r\nwhich was in a grove of silver firs. A large flock of sheep and goats,\r\nladen with salt, overtook us here on their route from Wallanchoon to\r\nYalloong. The sheep I observed to feed on the _Rhododendron Thomsoni_\r\nand _campylocarpum._ On the roots of one of the latter species a\r\nparasitical Broom-rape (_Orobanche_) grew abundantly; and about the\r\nmoraines were more mosses, lichens, etc., than I have elsewhere seen in\r\nthe loftier Himalaya, encouraged no doubt by the dampness of this grand\r\nmountain gorge, which is so hemmed in that the sun never reaches it\r\nuntil four or five hours after it has gilded the overhanging peaks.\r\n\r\n_December 5._—The morning was bright and clear, and we left early for\r\nthe Choonjerma pass. I had hoped the route would be up the magnificent\r\nglacier-girdled valley in which we had encamped; but it lay up another,\r\nconsiderably south of it, and to which we crossed, ascending the rocky\r\nmoraine, in the clefts of which grew abundance of a common Scotch fern,\r\n_Cryptogramma crispa_!\r\n\r\nThe clouds early commenced gathering, and it was curious to watch their\r\nrapid formation in coalescing streaks, which became first cirrhi, and\r\nthen stratus, being apparently continually added to from below by the\r\nmoisture-bringing southerly wind. Ascending a lofty spur, 1000 feet\r\nabove the valley, against which the moraine was banked, I found it to\r\nbe a distinct anticlinal axis. The pass, bearing north-west, and the\r\nvalley we had descended on the previous day, rose immediately over the\r\ncurved strata of quartz, topped by the glacier-crowned mountain of\r\nNango, with four glaciers descending from its perpetual snows. The\r\nstupendous cliffs on its flanks, under which I had camped on the\r\nprevious night, were very grand, but not more so than those which\r\ndipped into the chasm of the Kambachen below. Looking up the valley of\r\nthe latter, was another wilderness of ice full of enormous moraines,\r\nround the bases of which the river wound.\r\n\r\nAscending, we reached an open grassy valley, and overtook the Tibetans\r\nwho had preceded us, and who had halted here to feed their sheep. A\r\ngood-looking girl of the party came to ask me for medicine for her\r\nhusband’s eyes, which had suffered from snow-blindness: she brought me\r\na present of snuff, and carried a little child, stark naked, yet warm\r\nfrom the powerful rays of the sun, at nearly 14,000 feet elevation, in\r\nDecember! I prescribed for the man, and gave the mother a bright\r\nfarthing to hang round the child’s neck, which delighted the party. My\r\nwatch was only wondered at; but a little spring measuring-tape that\r\nrolled itself up, struck them dumb, and when I threw it on the ground\r\nwith the tape out, the mother shrieked and ran away, while the little\r\nsavage howled after her.\r\n\r\nAbove, the path up the ascent was blocked with snowbeds, and for\r\nseveral miles we alternately scrambled among rocks and over slippery\r\nslopes, to the top of the first ridge, there being two to cross. The\r\nfirst consisted of a ridge of rocks running east and west from a superb\r\nsweep of snowy mountains to the north-west, which presented a chaotic\r\nscene of blue glacial ice and white snow, through which splintered\r\nrocks and beetling crags thrust their black heads. The view into the\r\nKambachen gorge was magnificent, though it did not reveal the very\r\nbottom of the valley and its moraines: the black precipices of its\r\nopposite flank seemed to rise to the glaciers of Nango, fore-shortened\r\ninto snow-capped precipices 5000 feet high, amongst which lay the\r\nKambachen pass, bearing north-west by north. Lower down the valley,\r\nappeared a broad flat, called Jubla, a halting-place one stage below\r\nthe village of Kambachen, on the road to Lelyp on the Tambur: it must\r\nbe a remarkable geological as well as natural feature, for it appeared\r\nto jut abruptly and quite horizontally from the black cliffs of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nLooking north, the conical head of Junnoo was just scattering the mists\r\nfrom its snowy shoulders, and standing forth to view, the most\r\nmagnificent spectacle I ever beheld. It was quite close to me, bearing\r\nnorth-east by east, and subtending an angle of 12° 23, and is much the\r\nsteepest and most conical of all the peaks of these regions. From\r\nwhichever side it is viewed, it rises 9000 feet above the general\r\nmountain mass of 16,000 feet elevation, towering like a blunt cone,\r\nwith a short saddle on one side, that dips in a steep cliff: it\r\nappeared as if uniformly snowed, from its rocks above 20,000 feet (like\r\nthose of Kinchinjunga) being of white granite, and not contrasting with\r\nthe snow. Whether the top is stratified or not, I cannot tell, but\r\nwaving parallel lines are very conspicuous near it, as shown in the\r\naccompanying view.[90]\r\n\r\n [90] The appearance of Mont Cervin, from the Riffelberg, much reminded\r\n me of that of Junnoo, from the Choonjerma pass, the former bearing the\r\n same relation to Monte Rosa that the latter does to Kinchinjunga.\r\n Junnoo, though incomparably the more stupendous mass, not only rising\r\n 10,000 feat higher above the sea, but towering 4000 feet higher above\r\n the ridge on which it is supported, is not nearly so remarkable in\r\n outline, so sharp, or so peaked as is Mount Cervin: it is a very much\r\n grander, but far less picturesque object. The whiteness of the sides\r\n of Junnoo adds also greatly to its apparent altitude; while the strong\r\n relief in which the black cliffs of Mont Cervin protrude through its\r\n snowy mantle greatly diminish both its apparent height and distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Junnoo 24,000 ft. from Choonjerma Pass 16,000 ft. East\r\nNepal]\r\n\r\nLooking south as evening drew on, another wonderful spectacle presented\r\nitself, similar to that which I described at Sakkiazung, but displayed\r\nhere on an inconceivably grander scale, with all the effects\r\nexaggerated. I saw a sea of mist floating 3000 feet beneath me, just\r\nbelow the upper level of the black pines; the magnificent spurs of the\r\nsnowy range which I had crossed rising out of it in rugged grandeur as\r\npromontories and peninsulas, between which the misty ocean seemed to\r\nfinger up like the fiords of Norway, or the salt-water lochs of the\r\nwest of Scotland; whilst islets tailed off from the promontories,\r\nrising here and there out of the deceptive elements. I was so high\r\nabove this mist, that it had not the billowy appearance I saw before,\r\nbut was a calm unruffled ocean, boundless to the south and west, where\r\nthe horizon over-arched it. A little to the north of west I discerned\r\nthe most lofty group of mountains in Nepal[91] (mentioned at p. 185),\r\nbeyond Kinchinjurga, which I believe are on the west flank of the great\r\nvalley through which the Arun river enters Nepal from Tibet: they were\r\nvery distant, and subtended so small an angle, that I could not measure\r\nthem with the sextant and artificial horizon their height, judging from\r\nthe quantity of snow, must be prodigious.\r\n\r\n [91] Called Tsungau by the Bhoteeas. Junnoo is called Kumbo~Kurma by\r\n the Hill-men of Nepal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 4 to 5 p.m. the temperature was 24°, with a very cold wind; the\r\nelevation by the barometer was 15,260 feet, and the dew-point 10.5°,\r\ngiving the humidity 0·610, and the amount of vapour 1·09 grains in a\r\ncubic foot of air; the same elements at Calcutta, at the same hour,\r\nbeing thermometer 66·5°, dew-point 60·5°, humidity 0·840, and weight of\r\nvapour 5·9 grains.\r\n\r\nI waited for an hour, examining the rocks about the pass, till the\r\ncoolies should come up, but saw nothing worthy of remark, the natural\r\nhistory and geology being identical with those of Kambachen pass: I\r\nthen bade adieu to the sublime and majestic peak of Junnoo. Thence we\r\ncontinued at nearly the same level for about four miles, dipping into\r\nthe broad head of a snowy valley, and ascending to the second pass,\r\nwhich lay to the south-east.\r\n\r\nOn the left I passed a very curious isolated pillar of rock, amongst\r\nthe wild crags to the north-east, whose bases we skirted: it resembles\r\nthe Capuchin on the shoulder of Mont Blanc, as seen from the Jardin.\r\nEvening overtook us while still on the snow near the last ascent. As\r\nthe sun declined, the snow at our feet reflected the most exquisitely\r\ndelicate peach-bloom hue; and looking west from the top of the pass,\r\nthe scenery was gorgeous beyond description, for the sun was just\r\nplunging into a sea of mist, amongst some cirrhi and stratus, all in a\r\nblaze of the ruddiest coppery hue. As it sank, the Nepal, peaks to the\r\nright assumed more definite, darker, and gigantic forms, and floods of\r\nlight shot across the misty ocean, bathing the landscape around me in\r\nthe most wonderful and indescribable changing tints. As the luminary\r\nwas vanishing, the whole horizon glowed like copper run from a smelting\r\nfurnace, and when it had quite disappeared, the little inequalities of\r\nthe ragged edges of the mist were lighted up and shone like a row of\r\nvolcanos in the far distance. I have never before or since seen\r\nanything, which for sublimity, beauty, and marvellous effects, could\r\ncompare with what I gazed on that evening from Choonjerma pass. In some\r\nof Turner’s pictures I have recognized similar effects, caught and\r\nfixed by a marvellous effort of genius; such are the fleeting hues over\r\nthe ice, in his “Whalers,” and the ruddy fire in his “Wind, Steam, and\r\nRain,” which one almost fears to touch. Dissolving views give some idea\r\nof the magic creation and dispersion of the effects, but any\r\ncombination of science and art can no more recall the scene, than it\r\ncan the feelings of awe that crept over me, during the hour I spent in\r\nsolitude amongst these stupendous mountains.\r\n\r\nThe moon guided us on our descent, which was to the south, obliquely\r\ninto the Yalloong valley. I was very uneasy about the coolies, who were\r\nfar behind, and some of them had been frost-bitten in crossing the\r\nKambachen pass. Still I thought the best thing was to push on, and\r\nlight large fires at the first juniper we should reach. The change, on\r\npassing from off the snow to the dark earth and rock, was so\r\nbewildering, that I had great difficulty in picking my way. Suddenly we\r\ncame on a flat with a small tarn, whose waters gleamed illusively in\r\nthe pale moonlight: the opposite flanks of the valley were so well\r\nreflected on its gloomy surface, that we were at once brought to a\r\nstand-still on its banks: it looked like a chasm, and whether to jump\r\nacross it, or go down it, or along it, was the question, so deceptive\r\nwas the spectral landscape. Its true nature was, however, soon\r\ndiscovered, and we proceeded round it, descending. Of course there was\r\nno path, and after some perplexity amongst rocks and ravines, we\r\nreached the upper limit of wood, and halted by some bleached\r\njuniper-trees, which were soon converted into blazing fires.\r\n\r\nI wandered away from my party to listen for the voices of the men who\r\nhad lingered behind, about whom I was still more anxious, from the very\r\ngreat difficulty they would encounter if, as we did, they should get\r\noff the path. The moon was shining clearly in the black heavens; and\r\nits bright light, with the pale glare of the surrounding snow, obscured\r\nthe milky way, and all the smaller stars; whilst the planets appeared\r\nto glow with broader orbs than elsewhere, and the great stars flashed\r\nsteadily and periodically.\r\n\r\nDeep black chasms seemed to yawn below, and cliffs rose on all sides,\r\nexcept down the valley, where looking across the Yalloong river, a\r\nsteep range of mountains rose, seamed with torrents that were just\r\nvisible like threads of silver coursing down broad landslips. It was a\r\ndead calm, and nothing broke the awful silence but the low hoarse\r\nmurmur of many torrents, whose mingled voices rose and fell as if with\r\nthe pulsations of the atmosphere; the undulations of which appeared\r\nthus to be marked by the ear alone. Sometimes it was the faintest\r\npossible murmur, and then it rose swelling and filling the air with\r\nsound: the effect was that of being raised from the earth’s surface,\r\nand again lowered to it; or that of waters advancing and retiring. In\r\nsuch scenes and with such accompaniments, the mind wanders from the\r\nreal to the ideal, the larger and brighter lamps of heaven lead us to\r\nimagine that we have risen from the surface of our globe and are\r\nfloating through the regions of space, and that the ceaseless murmur of\r\nthe waters is the Music of the Spheres.\r\n\r\nContemplation amid such soothing sounds and impressive scenes is very\r\nseductive, and withal very dangerous, for the temperature was at\r\nfreezing-point, my feet and legs were wet through, and it was well that\r\nI was soon roused from my reveries by the monosyllabic exclamations of\r\nmy coolies. They were quite knocked up, and came along grunting, and\r\nhalting every minute to rest, by supporting their loads, still hanging\r\nto their backs, on their stout staves. I had still one bottle of brandy\r\nleft, with which to splice the main brace. It had been repeatedly\r\nbegged for in vain, and being no longer expected, was received with\r\nunfeigned joy. Fortunately with these people a little spirits goes a\r\nlong way, and I kept half for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nWe camped at 13,290 feet, the air was calm and mild to the feeling,\r\nthough the temperature fell to 22·75°. On the following morning we saw\r\ntwo musk-deer,[92] called “Kosturah” by the mountaineers. The musk,\r\nwhich hangs in a pouch near the navel of the male, is the well-known\r\nobject of traffic with Bengal. This creature ranges between 8000 and\r\n13,000 feet, on the Himalaya, often scenting the air for many hundred\r\nyards. It is a pretty grey animal, the size of a roebuck, and something\r\nresembling it, with coarse fur, short horns, and two projecting teeth\r\nfrom the upper jaw, said to be used in rooting up the aromatic herbs\r\nfrom which the Bhoteeas believe that it derives the odour of musk. This\r\nI much doubt, because the animal never frequents those very lofty\r\nregions where the herbs supposed to provide the scent are found, nor\r\nhave I ever seen signs of any having been so rooted up. The _Delphinium\r\nglaciale_ smells strongly and disagreeably of musk, but it is one of\r\nthe most alpine plants in the world, growing at an elevation of 17,000\r\nfeet, far above the limits of the Kosturah. The female and young male\r\nare very good eating, much better than any Indian venison I ever\r\ntasted, being sweet and tender. Mr. Hodgson once kept a female alive,\r\nbut it was very wild, and continued so as long as I knew it. Two of my\r\nLepchas gave chase to these animals, and fired many arrows in vain\r\nafter them: these people are fond of carrying a bow, but are very poor\r\nshots.\r\n\r\n [92] There are two species of musk-deer in the Himalaya, besides the\r\n Tibetan kind, which appears identical with the Siberian animal\r\n originally described by Pallas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe descended 3000 feet to the deep valley of the Yalloong river which\r\nruns west-by-south to the Tambur, from between Junnoo and Kubra: the\r\npath was very bad, over quartz, granite, and gneiss, which cut the\r\nshoes and feet severely. The bottom of the valley, which is elevated\r\n10,450 feet, was filled with an immense accumulation of angular gravel\r\nand débris of the above rocks, forming on both sides of the river a\r\nterrace 400 feet above the stream, which flowed in a furious torrent.\r\nThe path led over this deposit for a good many miles, and varied\r\nexceedingly in height, in some places being evidently increased by\r\nlandslips, and at others apparently by moraines.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibetan charm-box]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nYalloong valley—Fiud Kanglanamo pass closed—Change route for the\r\nsouthward—_Picrorhiza_—View of Kubra—_Rhododendron Falconeri_—Yalloong\r\nriver—Junction of gneiss and clay-slate—Cross Yalloong\r\nrange—View—Descent—Yew—Vegetation—Misty weather—Tongdam\r\nvillage—Khabang—Tropical vegetation—Sidingbah Mountain—View of\r\nKinchinjunga—Yangyading village—Slopes of hills, and courses of\r\nrivers—Khabili valley—Ghorkha Havildar’s bad conduct—Ascend\r\nSingalelah—Plague of ticks—Short commons—Cross Islumbo pass—Boundary of\r\nSikkim—Kulhait valley—Lingeham—Reception by Kajee—Hear of Dr.\r\nCampbell’s going to meet Rajah—Views in valley—Leave for Teesta\r\nriver—Tipsy Kajee—Hospitality—Murwa beer—Temples—_Acorus Calamus_—Long\r\nMendong—Burning of dead—Superstitions—Cross Great Rungeet—Boulders,\r\norigin of—Purchase of a dog—Marshes—Lamas—Dismiss Ghorkhas—Bhoteea\r\nhouse—Murwa beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the bottom we found a party who were travelling with\r\nsheep laden with salt; they told us that the Yalloong village, which\r\nlay up the valley on the route to the Kanglanamo pass (leading over the\r\nsouth shoulder of Kubra into Sikkim) was deserted, the inhabitants\r\nhaving retired after the October fall of snow to Yankutang, two marches\r\ndown; also that the Kanglanamo pass was impracticable, being always\r\nblocked up by the October fall. I was, therefore, reluctantly obliged\r\nto abandon the plan of pursuing that route to Sikkim, and to go south,\r\nfollowing the west flank of Singalelah to the first of the many passes\r\nover it which I might find open.\r\n\r\nThese people were very civil, and gave me a handful of the root of one\r\nof the many bitter herbs called in Bengal “Teeta,” and used as a\r\nfebrifuge: the present was that of _Picrorhiza,_ a plant allied to\r\nSpeedwell, which grows at from 12,000 to 15,000 feet elevation, and is\r\na powerful bitter, called “Hoonling” by the Tibetans. They had with\r\nthem above 100 sheep, of a tall, long-legged, Roman-nosed breed. Each\r\ncarried upwards of forty pounds of salt, done up in two leather bags,\r\nslung on either side, and secured by a band going over the chest, and\r\nanother round the loins, so that they cannot slip off, when going up or\r\ndown hill. These sheep are very tame, patient creatures, travelling\r\ntwelve miles a day with great ease, and being indifferent to rocky or\r\nsteep ground.\r\n\r\nLooking east I had a splendid view of the broad snowy mass of Kubra,\r\nblocking up, as it were, the head of the valley with a white screen.\r\nDescending to about 10,000 feet, the _Abies Brunoniana_ appeared, with\r\nfine trees of _Rhododendron Falconeri_ forty feet high, and with leaves\r\nnineteen inches long! while the upper part of the valley was full of\r\n_Abies Webbiana._\r\n\r\nAt the elevation of 9000 feet, we crossed to the east bank, and passed\r\nthe junction of the gneiss and mica slate: the latter crossed the\r\nriver, striking north-west, and the stream cut a dark chasm-like\r\nchannel through it, foaming and dashing the spray over the splintered\r\nridges, and the broad water-worn hog-backed masses that projected from\r\nits bed. Immense veins of granite permeated the rocks, which were\r\ncrumpled in the strangest manner: isolated angular blocks of schist had\r\nbeen taken up by the granite in a fluid state, and remained imbedded in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe road made great ascents to avoid landslips, and to surmount the\r\nenormous piles of débris which encumber this valley more than any\r\nother. We encamped at 10,050 feet, on a little flat 1000 feet above the\r\nbed of the river, and on its east flank. A _Hydrangea_ was the common\r\nsmall wood, but _Abies Webbiana_ formed the forest, with great\r\nRhododendrons. The weather was foggy, whence I judged that we were in\r\nthe sea of mist I saw beneath me from the passes; the temperature,\r\nconsidering the elevation, was mild, 37° and 38°, which was partly due\r\nto the evolution of heat that accompanies the condensation of these\r\nvapours, the atmosphere being loaded with moisture. The thermometer\r\nfell to 28° during the night, and in the morning the ground was thickly\r\ncovered with hoar-frost.\r\n\r\n_December 7._—We ascended the Yalloong ridge to a saddle 11,000 feet\r\nelevation, whence the road dips south to the gloomy gorges of the\r\neastern feeders of the Tambur. Here we bade adieu to the grand alpine\r\nscenery, and for several days our course lay in Nepal in a southerly\r\ndirection, parallel to Singalelah, and crossing every spur and river\r\nsent off by that mighty range. The latter flow towards the Tambur, and\r\ntheir beds, for forty or fifty miles are elevated about 3000 or 4000\r\nfeet. Few of the spurs are ascended above 5000 feet, but all of them\r\nrise to 12,000 or 14,000 feet to the westward, where they join the\r\nSingalelah range.\r\n\r\nI clambered to the top of a lofty hummock, through a dense thicket of\r\ninterwoven Rhododendron bushes, the clayey soil under which was\r\nslippery from the quantity of dead leaves. I had hoped for a view of\r\nthe top of Kinchinjunga, which bore north-east, but it was enveloped in\r\nclouds, as were all the snows in that direction; to the north-west,\r\nhowever, I obtained bearings of the principal peaks, etc., of the\r\nYangma and Kambachen valleys. To the south and south-east, lofty,\r\nrugged and pine-clad mountains rose in confused masses, and white\r\nsheets of mist came driving up, clinging to the mountain-tops, and\r\nshrouding the landscape with extreme rapidity. The remarkable mountain\r\nof Sidingbah bore south-south-east, raising its rounded head above the\r\nclouds. I could, however, procure no other good bearing.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the Yalloong ridge to the Khabili feeders of the\r\nTambur was very steep, and in some places almost precipitous, first\r\nthrough dense woods of silver fir, with _Rhod. Falconeri_ and\r\n_Hodgsoni,_ then through _Abies Brunoniana,_ with yew (now covered with\r\nred berries) to the region of Magnolias and _Rhod. arboreum_ and\r\n_barbatum._ One bush of the former was in flower, making a gorgeous\r\nshow. Here also appeared the great oak with lamellated acorns, which I\r\nhad not seen in the drier valleys to the westward; with many other\r\nDorjiling trees and shrubs. A heavy mist clung to the rank luxuriant\r\nfoliage, tantalizing from its obscuring all the view. Mica schist\r\nreplaced the gneiss, and a thick slippery stratum of clay rendered it\r\nvery difficult to keep one’s footing. After so many days of bright\r\nsunshine and dry weather, I found this quiet, damp, foggy atmosphere to\r\nhave a most depressing effect: there was little to interest in the\r\nmeteorology, the atmospheric fluctuations being far too small;\r\ngeographical discovery was at an end, and we groped our way along\r\ndevious paths in wooded valleys, or ascended spurs and ridges, always\r\nclouded before noon, and clothed with heavy forest.\r\n\r\nAt 6000 feet we emerged from the mist, and found ourselves clambering\r\ndown a deep gully, hemmed in by frightful rocky steeps, which exposed a\r\nfine and tolerably continuous section of schistose rocks, striking\r\nnorth-west, and dipping north-east, at a very high angle.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom three furious torrents met: we descended the course of\r\none of them, over slanting precipices, or trees lashed to the rocks,\r\nand after a most winding course our path conducted us to the village of\r\nTarbu, high above a feeder of the Khabili river, which flows west,\r\njoining the Tambur three days’ march lower down. Having no food, we had\r\nmade a very long and difficult march to this place, but finding none\r\nhere, proceeded on to Tonghem village on the Khabili, descending\r\nthrough thickets of _Rhod. arboreum_ to the elevation of 5,560.\r\n\r\nThis village, or spur, called “Tonghem” by the Limboos, and “Yankutang”\r\nby the Bhoteeas, is the winter resort of the inhabitants of the upper\r\nYalloong valley: they received us very kindly, sold us two fowls, and\r\nrice enough to last for one or two days, which was all they could\r\nspare, and gave me a good deal of information. I found that the\r\nKanglanamo pass had been disused since the Nepal war, that it was very\r\nlofty, and always closed in October.\r\n\r\nThe night was fine, clear, and warm, but the radiation so powerful that\r\nthe grass was coated with ice the following morning, though the\r\nthermometer did not fall below 33°. The next day the sun rose with\r\ngreat power, and the vegetation reeked and steamed with the heat.\r\nCrossing the river, we first made a considerable descent, and then\r\nascended a ridge to 5,750 feet, through a thick jungle of _Camellia,\r\nEurya,_ and small oak: from the top I obtained bearings of Yalloong and\r\nChoonjerma pass, and had also glimpses of the Kinchin range through a\r\ntantalizing jungle; after which a very winding and fatiguing\r\nup-and-down march southwards brought us to the village of Khabang, in\r\nthe magnificent valley of the Tawa, about 800 feet above the river, and\r\n5,500 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nI halted here for a day, to refresh the people, and if possible to\r\nobtain some food. I hoped, too, to find a pass into Sikkim, east over\r\nSingalelah, but was disappointed: if there had ever been one, it had\r\nbeen closed since the Nepal war; and there was none, for several\r\nmarches further south, which would conduct us to the Iwa branch of the\r\nKhabili.\r\n\r\nKhabang is a village of Geroongs, or shepherds, who pasture their\r\nflocks on the hills and higher valleys during summer, and bring them\r\ndown to this elevation in winter: the ground was consequently infested\r\nwith a tick, equal in size to that so common in the bushes, and quite\r\nas troublesome, but of a different species.\r\n\r\nThe temperature rose to 72°, and the black-bulb thermometer to 140°.\r\nMagnolias and various almost tropical trees were common, and the\r\nherbaceous vegetation was that of low elevations. Large sugar-cane\r\n(_Saccharum_), palm (_Wallichia_), and wild plantains grew near the\r\nriver, and _Rhod. arboreum_ was very common on dry slopes of mica-slate\r\nrocks, with the gorgeous and sweet-scented _Luculia gratissima._\r\n\r\nUp the valley of the Tawa the view was very grand of a magnificent\r\nrocky mountain called Sidingbah, bearing south-east by south, on a spur\r\nof the Singalelah range that runs westerly, and forms the south flank\r\nof the Tawa, and the north of the Khabili valleys. This mountain is\r\nfully 12,000 feet high, crested with rock and ragged black forest,\r\nwhich, on the north flank, extends to its base: to the eastward, the\r\nbare ridges of Singalelah were patched with snow, below which they too\r\nwere clothed with black pines.\r\n\r\nFrom the opposite side of the Tawa to Khabang (alt. 6,020 feet), I was,\r\nduring our march southwards, most fortunate in obtaining a splendid\r\nview of Kinchinjunga (bearing north-east by north), with its\r\nassociates, rising over the dark mass of Singalelah, its flanks showing\r\nlike tier above tier of green glaciers: its distance was fully\r\ntwenty-five miles, and as only about 7000 feet or 8000 feet from its\r\nsummit were visible, and Kubra was foreshortened against it, its\r\nappearance was not grand; added to which, its top was round and\r\nhummocky, not broken into peaks, as when seen from the south and east.\r\nVillages and cultivation became more frequent as we proceeded\r\nsouthward, and our daily marches were up ridges, and down into deep\r\nvalleys, with feeders from the flanks of Sidingbah to the Tambur. We\r\npassed through the village of Tchonboong, and camped at Yangyading\r\n(4,100 feet), sighted Yamroop, a large village and military post to the\r\nwest of our route, crossed the Pangwa river, and reached the valley of\r\nthe Khabili. During this part of the journey, I did not once see the\r\nTambur river, though I was day after day marching only seven to ten\r\nmiles distant from it, so uneven is the country. The mountains around\r\nTaptiatok, Mywa Guola, and Chingtam, were pointed out to me, but they\r\npresented no recognizable feature.\r\n\r\nI often looked for some slope, or strike of the slopes of the spurs, in\r\nany one valley, or that should prevail through several, but could\r\nseldom trace any, except on one or two occasions, at low elevations.\r\nLooking here across the valleys, there was a tendency in the gentle\r\nslopes of the spurs to have plane faces dipping north-east, and to be\r\nbounded by a line of cliffs striking north-west, and facing the\r\nsouth-east. In such arrangements, the upheaved cliffs may be supposed\r\nto represent parallel lines of faults, dislocation, or rupture, but I\r\ncould never trace any secondary valleys at right angles to these. There\r\nis no such uniformity of strike as to give to the rivers a zig-zag\r\ncourse of any regularity, or one having any apparent dependence on a\r\nprevailing arrangement of the rocks; for, though the strike of the\r\nchlorite and clay-slate at elevations below 6000 feet along its course,\r\nis certainly north-west, with a dip to north-east, the flexures of the\r\nriver, as projected on the map, deviate very widely from these\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Khabili is very grand, broad, open, and intersected\r\nby many streams and cultivated spurs: the road from Yamroop to Sikkim,\r\nonce well frequented, runs up its north flank, and though it was long\r\nclosed we determined to follow and clear it.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of December we camped near the village of Sablakoo (4,680\r\nfeet), and procured five days’ food, to last us as far as the first\r\nSikkim village. Thence we proceeded eastward up the valley, but\r\ndescending to the Iwa, an affluent of the Khabili, through a tropical\r\nvegetation of _Pinus longifolia, Phyllanthus Emblica,_ dwarf date-palm,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nGneiss was here the prevailing rock, uniformly dipping north-east 20°,\r\nand striking north-west. The same rock no doubt forms the mass\r\nSidingbah, which reared its head 8000 feet above the Iwa river, by\r\nwhose bed we camped at 3,780 feet. Sand-flies abounded, and were most\r\ntroublesome: troops of large monkeys were skipping about, and the whole\r\nscene was thoroughly tropical; still, the thermometer fell to 38° in\r\nthe night, with heavy dew.\r\n\r\nThough we passed numerous villages, I found unusual difficulty in\r\ngetting provision, and received none of the presents so uniformly\r\nbrought by the villagers to a stranger. I was not long in discovering,\r\nto my great mortification, that these were appropriated by the Ghorkha\r\nHavildar, who seemed to have profited by our many days of short\r\nallowance, and diverted the current of hospitality from me to himself.\r\nHis coolies I saw groaning under heavy burdens, when those of my people\r\nwere light; and the truth only came out when he had the impudence to\r\nattempt to impose a part of his coolies’ loads on mine, to enable the\r\nformer to carry more food, whilst he was pretending that he used every\r\nexertion to procure me a scanty supply of rice with my limited stock of\r\nmoney. I had treated this man and his soldiers with the utmost\r\nkindness, even nursing them and clothing them from my own stock of\r\nflannels, when sick and shivering amongst the snows. Though a high\r\ncaste Hindoo, and one who assumed Brahmin rank, he had, I found, no\r\nobjection to eat forbidden things in secret; and now that we were\r\ntravelling amongst Hindoos, his caste obtained him everything, while\r\nmoney alone availed me. I took him roundly to task for his treachery,\r\nwhich caused him secretly to throw away a leg of mutton he had\r\nconcealed; I also threatened to expose the humbug of his pretension to\r\ncaste, but it was then too late to procure more food. Having hitherto\r\nmuch liked this man, and fully trusted him, I was greatly pained by his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded east for three days, up the valley, through gloomy forests\r\nof tropical trees below 5000 feet; and ascended to oaks and magnolias\r\nat 6000 feet. The path was soon obstructed, and we had to tear and cut\r\nour way, from 6000 to 10,000 feet, which took two days’ very hard work.\r\nTicks swarmed in the small bamboo jungle, and my body was covered with\r\nthese loathsome insects, which got into my bed and hair, and even\r\nattached themselves to my eyelids during the night, when the constant\r\nannoyance and irritation completely banished sleep. In the daytime they\r\npenetrated my trousers, piercing to my body in many places, so that I\r\nrepeatedly took off as many as twelve at one time. It is indeed\r\nmarvellous how so large an insect can painlessly insert a stout barbed\r\nproboscis, which requires great force to extract it, and causes severe\r\nsmarting in the operation. What the ticks feed upon in these humid\r\nforests is a perfect mystery to me, for from 6000 to 9000 feet they\r\nliterally swarmed, where there was neither path nor animal life. They\r\nwere, however, more tolerable than a commoner species of parasite,\r\nwhich I found it impossible to escape from, all classes of mountaineers\r\nbeing infested with it.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, after an arduous ascent through the pathless jungle, we\r\ncamped at 9,300 feet on a narrow spur, in a dense forest, amongst\r\nimmense loose blocks of gneiss. The weather was foggy and rainy, and\r\nthe wind cold. I ate the last supply of animal food, a miserable\r\nstarved pullet, with rice and Chili vinegar; my tea, sugar, and all\r\nother superfluities having been long before exhausted.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, we crossed the Islumbo pass over Singalelah\r\ninto Sikkim, the elevation being 11,000 feet. Above our camp the trees\r\nwere few and stunted, and we quickly emerged from the forest on a rocky\r\nand grassy ridge, covered with withered _Saxifrages, Umbelliferæ,\r\nParnassia, Hypericum,_ etc. There were no pines on either side of the\r\npass; a very remarkable peculiarity of the damp mountains of Sikkim,\r\nwhich I have elsewhere had occasion to notice: we had left _Pinus\r\nlongifolia_ (a far from common tree in these valleys) at 3000 feet in\r\nthe Tawa three days before, and ascended to 11,000 feet without passing\r\na coniferous tree of any kind, except a few yews, at 9000 feet, covered\r\nwith red berries.\r\n\r\nThe top of the pass was broad, grassy, and bushy with dwarf Bamboo,\r\nRose, and Berberry, in great abundance, covered with mosses and\r\nlichens: it had been raining hard all the morning, and the vegetation\r\nwas coated with ice: a dense fog obscured everything, and a violent\r\nsouth-east wind blew over the pass in our teeth. I collected some very\r\ncurious and beautiful mosses, putting these frozen treasures into my\r\nbox, in the form of exquisitely beautiful glass ornaments, or mosses\r\nfrosted with silver.\r\n\r\nA few stones marked the boundary between Nepal and Sikkim, where I\r\nhalted for half an hour, and hung up my instruments: the temperature\r\nwas 32°.\r\n\r\nWe descended rapidly, proceeding eastward down the broad valley of the\r\nKulhait river, an affluent of the Great Rungeet; and as it had begun to\r\nsleet and snow hard, we continued until we reached 6,400 feet before\r\ncamping.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we proceeded down the valley, and reached\r\nhabitations at 4000 feet: passing many villages and much cultivation,\r\nwe crossed the river, and ascended by 7 p.m., to the village of\r\nLingcham, just below the convent of Changachelling, very tired and\r\nhungry. Bad weather had set in, and it was pitch dark and raining hard\r\nwhen we arrived; but the Kajee, or head man, had sent out a party with\r\ntorches to conduct us, and he gave us a most hospitable reception,\r\nhonoured us with a salute of musketry, and brought abundance of milk,\r\neggs, fowls, plantains, and Murwa beer. Plenty of news was awaiting me\r\nhere, and a messenger with letters was three marches further north, at\r\nYoksun, waiting my expected return over the Kanglanamo pass. Dr.\r\nCampbell, I was told, had left Dorjiling; and was _en route_ to meet\r\nthe Rajah at Bhomsong on the Teesta river, where no European had ever\r\nyet been; and as the Sikkim authorities had for sixteen years steadily\r\nrejected every overture for a friendly interview, and even refused to\r\nallow the agent of the Governor-General to enter their dominions, it\r\nwas evident that grave doings were pending. I knew that Dr. Campbell\r\nhad long used every exertion to bring the Sikkim Rajah to a friendly\r\nconference, without having to force his way into the country for the\r\npurpose, but in vain. It will hardly be believed that though this\r\nchief’s dominions were redeemed by us from the Nepalese and given back\r\nto him; though we had bound ourselves by a treaty to support him on his\r\nthrone, and to defend him against the Nepalese on the west, the Bhutan\r\npeople on the east, and the Tibetans on the north; and though the terms\r\nof the treaty stipulated for free intercourse, mutual protection, and\r\nfriendship; the Sikkim authorities had hitherto been allowed to\r\nobstruct all intercourse, and in every way to treat the\r\nGovernor-General’s agent and the East India Company with contempt. An\r\naffectation of timidity, mistrust, and ignorance was assumed for the\r\npurpose of deception, and as a cloak for every insult and resistance to\r\nthe terms of our treaty, and it was quoted by the Government in answer\r\nto every remonstrance on the part of their resident agent at Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Kajee waited on me with a magnificent\r\npresent of a calf, a kid, fowls, eggs, rice, oranges, plantains,\r\negg-apples, Indian corn, yams, onions, tomatos, parsley, fennel,\r\nturmeric, rancid butter, milk, and, lastly, a coolie-load of fermenting\r\nmillet-seeds, wherewith to make the favourite Murwa beer. In the\r\nevening two lads arrived from Dorjiling, who had been sent a week\r\nbeforehand by my kind and thoughtful friend, Mr. Hodgson, with\r\nprovisions and money.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Kulhait is one o£ the finest in Sikkim, and it is\r\naccordingly the site of two of the oldest and richest conventual\r\nestablishments. Its length is sixteen miles, from the Islumbo pass to\r\nthe Great Rungeet, for ten of which it is inhabited, the villages being\r\ninvariably on long meridional spurs that project north and south from\r\neither flank; they are about 2000 feet above the river, and from 4,500\r\nto 5000 feet above the sea. Except where these spurs project, the\r\nflanks of the valley are very steep, the mountains rising to 7000 or\r\n8000 feet.\r\n\r\nLooking from any spur, up or down the valley, five or six others might\r\nbe seen on each side of the river, at very nearly the same average\r\nlevel, all presenting great uniformity of contour, namely, a gentle\r\nslope towards the centre of the valley, and then an abrupt descent to\r\nthe river. They were about a quarter of a mile broad at the widest, and\r\noften narrower, and a mile or so long; some parts of their surfaces and\r\nsides were quite flat, and occasionally occupied by marshes or ponds.\r\nCultivation is almost confined to these spurs, and is carried on both\r\non their summits and steep flanks; between every two is a very steep\r\ngulley and water-course. The timber has long since been either wholly\r\nor partially cleared from the tops, but, to a great extent, still\r\nclothes their flanks and the intervening gorges. I have been particular\r\nin describing these spurs, because it is impossible to survey them\r\nwithout ascribing their comparative uniformity of level to the action\r\nof water. Similar ones are characteristic features of the valleys of\r\nSikkim between 2000 and 8000 feet, and are rendered conspicuous by\r\nbeing always sites for villages and cultivation: the soil is a\r\nvegetable mould, over a deep stratum of red clay.\r\n\r\nI am far from supposing that any geologically recent action of the sea\r\nhas levelled these spurs; but as the great chain of the Himalaya has\r\nrisen from the ocean, and as every part of it has been subjected to\r\nsea-action, it is quite conceivable that intervals of rest during the\r\nperiods of elevation or submergence would effect their levelling. In a\r\nmountain mass so tumbled as is that of Sikkim, any level surface, or\r\napproach to it, demands study; and when, as in the Kulhait valley, we\r\nfind several similar spurs with comparatively flat tops, to occupy\r\nabout the same level, it is necessary to look for some levelling cause.\r\nThe action of denudation is still progressing with astonishing\r\nrapidity, under an annual fall of from 100 to 150 inches of rain; but\r\nits tendency is to obliterate all such phenomena, and to give sharp,\r\nrugged outlines to these spurs, in spite of the conservative effects of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nThe weather at Lingcham was gloomy, cold, and damp, with much rain and\r\nfog, and the mean temperature (45·25°) was cold for the elevation\r\n(4,860 feet): 52·5° was the highest temperature observed, and 39° the\r\nlowest.\r\n\r\nA letter from Dr. Campbell reached me three days after my arrival,\r\nbegging me to cross the country to the Teesta river, and meet him at\r\nBhomsong, on its west bank, where he was awaiting my arrival. I\r\ntherefore left on the 20th of December, accompanied by my friend the\r\nKajee, who was going to pay his respects to the Rajah. He was\r\nconstantly followed by a lad, carrying a bamboo of Murwa beer slung\r\nround his neck, with which he kept himself always groggy. His dress was\r\nthoroughly Lepcha, and highly picturesque, consisting of a very\r\nbroad-brimmed round-crowned bamboo-platted hat, scarlet jacket, and\r\nblue-striped cloth shirt, bare feet, long knife, bow and quiver, rings\r\nand earrings, and a long pigtail. He spoke no Hindoostanee, but was\r\nvery communicative through my interpreters.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Lingcham spur, we passed steep cliffs of mica and schist,\r\ncovered with brushwood and long grass, about 1000 feet above which the\r\nChangachelling convent is perched. Crossing a torrent, we came to the\r\nnext village, on the spur of Kurziuk, where I was met by a deputation\r\nof women, sent by the Lamas of Changachelling, bearing enormous loads\r\nof oranges, rice, milk, butter, ghee, and the everflowing Murwa beer.\r\n\r\nThe villagers had erected a shady bower for me to rest under, of leaves\r\nand branches, and had fitted up a little bamboo stage, on which to\r\nsquat cross-legged as they do, or to hang my legs from, if I preferred:\r\nafter conducting me to this, the parties advanced and piled their\r\ncumbrous presents on the ground, bowed, and retired; they were\r\nsucceeded by the beer-carrier, who plunged a clean drinking-tube to the\r\nbottom of the steaming bamboo jug (described at p. 175), and held it to\r\nmy mouth, then placing it by my side, he bowed and withdrew. Nothing\r\ncan be more fascinating than the simple manners of these kind people,\r\nwho really love hospitality for its own sake, and make the stranger\r\nfeel himself welcome. Just now too, the Durbar had ordered every\r\nattention to be paid me; and I hardly passed a village however small,\r\nwithout receiving a present, or a cottage, where beer was not offered.\r\nThis I found a most grateful beverage; and of the occasional rests\r\nunder leafy screens during a hot day’s march, and sips at the bamboo\r\njug, I shall ever retain a grateful remembrance. Happily the liquor is\r\nvery weak, and except by swilling, as my friend the Kajee did, it would\r\nbe impossible to get fuddled by it.\r\n\r\nAt Kurziuk I was met by a most respectable Lepcha, who, as a sort of\r\ncompliment, sent his son to escort us to the next village and spur of\r\nPemiongchi, to reach which we crossed another gorge, of which the\r\nsituation and features were quite similar to those of Kurziuk and\r\nLingcham.\r\n\r\nThe Pemiongchi and Changachelling convents and temples stand a few\r\nmiles apart, on the ridge forming the north flank of the Kulhait\r\nvalley; and as they will be described hereafter, I now only allude to\r\nthe village, which is fully 1000 feet below the convent, and large and\r\npopulous.\r\n\r\nAt Pemiongchi a superior Lama met me with another overwhelming present:\r\nhe was a most jolly fat monk, shaven and girdled, and dressed in a\r\nscarlet gown: my Lepchas kotowed to him, and he blessed them by the\r\nlaying on of hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pemiongchi Goompa and chaits]\r\n\r\nThere is a marsh on this spur, full of the common English _Acorus\r\nCalamus,_ or sweet-flag, whose roots being very aromatic, are used in\r\ngriping disorders of men and cattle. Hence we descended suddenly to the\r\nGreat Rungeet, which we reached at its junction with the Kulhait: the\r\npath was very steep and slippery, owing to micaceous rocks, and led\r\nalong the side of an enormous Mendong,[93] which ran down the hill for\r\nseveral hundred yards, and had a large chait at each end, with several\r\nsmaller ones at intervals. Throughout its length were innumerable\r\ninscriptions of “Om Mani Padmi om,” with well carved figures of Boodh\r\nin his many incarnations, besides Lamas, etc. At the lower end was a\r\ngreat flat area, on which are burnt the bodies of Sikkim people of\r\nconsequence: the poorer people are buried, the richer burned, and their\r\nashes scattered or interred, but not in graves proper, of which there\r\nare none. Nor are there any signs of Lepcha interment throughout\r\nSikkim; though chaits are erected to the memory of the departed, they\r\nhave no necessary connection with the remains, and generally none at\r\nall. Corpses in Sikkim are never cut to pieces and thrown into lakes,\r\nor exposed on hills for the kites and crows to devour, as is the case\r\nin Tibet.\r\n\r\n [93] This remarkable structure, called the Kaysing Mendong, is 200\r\n yards long, 10 feet high, and 6 or 8 feet broad: it is built of flat,\r\n slaty stones, and both faces are covered with inscribed slates, of\r\n which there are upwards of 700, and the inscriptions, chiefly “Om\r\n Mani,” etc., are in both the Uchen and Lencha Ranja characters of\r\n Tibet. A tall stone, nine feet high, covered also with inscriptions,\r\n terminates it at the lower end.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe passed some curious masses of crumpled chlorite slate, presenting\r\ndeep canals or furrows, along which a demon once drained all the water\r\nfrom the Pemiongchi spur, to the great annoyance of the villagers: the\r\nLamas, however, on choosing this as a site for their temples, easily\r\nconfounded the machinations of the evil spirit, who, in the eyes of the\r\nsimple Lepchas, was answerable for all the mischief.\r\n\r\nI crossed the Great Rungeet at 1840 feet above the sea, where its bed\r\nwas twenty yards in width; a rude bridge, composed of two culms of\r\nbamboo and a handrail, conducted me to the other side, where we camped\r\n(on the east bank) in a thick tropical jungle. In the evening I walked\r\ndown the banks of the river, which flowed in a deep gorge, cumbered\r\nwith enormous boulders of granite, clay-slate, and mica-slate; the\r\nrocks _in situ_ were all of the latter description, highly inclined,\r\nand much dislocated. Some of the boulders were fully ten feet in\r\ndiameter, permeated and altered very much by granite veins which had\r\nevidently been injected when molten, and had taken up angular masses of\r\nthe chlorite which remained, as it were, suspended in the veins.\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy to account for the present position of these blocks\r\nof granite, a rock not common at elevations below 10,000 feet. They\r\nhave been transported from a considerable distance in the interior of\r\nthe lofty valley to the north, and have descended not less than 8000\r\nfeet, and travelled fully fifteen miles in a straight line, or perhaps\r\nforty along the river bed. It may be supposed that moraines have\r\ntransported them to 8000 feet (the lowest limit of apparent moraines),\r\nand the power of river water carried them further; if so, the rivers\r\nmust have been of much greater volume formerly than they are now.\r\n\r\nOur camp was on a gravel flat, like those of the Nepal valleys, about\r\nsixty feet above the river; its temperature was 52°, which felt cool\r\nwhen bathing.\r\n\r\nFrom the river we proceeded west, following a steep and clayey ascent\r\nup the end of a very long spur, from the lofty mountain range called\r\nMungbreu, dividing the Great Rungeet from the Teesta. We ascended by a\r\nnarrow path, accomplishing 2,500 feet in an hour and a quarter, walking\r\nslowly but steadily, without resting; this I always found a heavy pull\r\nin a hot climate.\r\n\r\nAt about 4000 feet above the sea, the spur became more open and flat,\r\nlike those of the Kulhait valley, with alternate slopes and comparative\r\nflats: from this elevation the view north, south, and west, was very\r\nfine; below us flowed the river, and a few miles up it was the conical\r\nwooded hill of Tassiding, rising abruptly from a fork of the deep river\r\ngorge, crowned with its curious temples and mendongs, and bristling\r\nwith chaits: on it is the oldest monastery in Sikkim, occupying a\r\nsingularly picturesque and prominent position. North of this spur, and\r\nsimilar to it, lay that of Raklang, with the temple and monastery of\r\nthe same name, at about this elevation. In front, looking west, across\r\nthe Great Rungeet, were the monasteries of Changachelling and\r\nPemiongchi, perched aloft; and south of these were the flat-topped\r\nspurs of the Kulhait valley, with their villages, and the great mendong\r\nwhich I had passed on the previous day, running like a white line down\r\nthe spur. To the north, beyond Tassiding, were two other monasteries,\r\nDoobdee and Sunnook, both apparently placed on the lower wooded flanks\r\nof Kinchinjunga; whilst close by was Dholing, the seventh religious\r\nestablishment now in sight.\r\n\r\nWe halted at a good wooden house to refresh ourselves with Murwa beer,\r\nwhere I saw a woman with cancer in the face, an uncommon complaint in\r\nthis country. I here bought a little black puppy, to be my future\r\ncompanion in Sikkim: he was of a breed between the famous Tibet mastiff\r\nand the common Sikkim hunting-dog, which is a variety of the sorry race\r\ncalled Pariah in the plains. Being only a few weeks old, he looked a\r\nmere bundle of black fur; and I carried him off, for he could not walk.\r\n\r\nWe camped at the village of Lingdam (alt. 5,550 feet), occupying a\r\nflat, and surrounded by extensive pools of water (for this country)\r\ncontaining _Acorus, Potamogeton,_ and duckweed. Such ponds I have often\r\nmet with on these terraces, and they are very remarkable, not being\r\ndammed in by any conspicuous barrier, but simply occupying depressions\r\nin the surface, from which, as I have repeatedly observed, the land\r\ndips rapidly to the valleys below.\r\n\r\nThis being the high-road from Tumloong or Sikkim Durbar (the capital,\r\nand Rajah’s residence) to the numerous monasteries which I had seen, we\r\npassed many Lamas and monks on their way home from Tumloong, where they\r\nhad gone to be present at the marriage of the Tupgain Lama, the eldest\r\nson of the Rajah. A dispensation having previously been procured from\r\nLhassa, this marriage had been effected by the Lamas, in order to\r\ncounteract the efforts of the Dewan, who sought to exercise an undue\r\ninfluence over the Rajah and his family. The Tupgain Lama having only\r\nspiritual authority, and being bound to celibacy, the temporal\r\nauthority devolved on the second son, who was heir apparent of Sikkim;\r\nhe, however, having died, an illegitimate son of the Rajah was favoured\r\nby the Dewan as heir apparent. The bride was brought from Tibet, and\r\nthe marriage party were feasted for eighteen days at the Rajah’s\r\nexpense. All the Lamas whom I met were clad in red robes, with girdles,\r\nand were shaven, with bare feet and heads, or mitred; they wore\r\nrosaries of onyx, turquoise, quartz, lapis lazuli, coral, glass, amber,\r\nor wood, especially yellow berberry and sandal-wood: some had staves,\r\nand one a trident like an eel-fork, on a long staff, an emblem of the\r\nHindoo Trinity, called Trisool Mahadeo, which represents Brahma, Siva,\r\nand Vishnu, in Hindoo; and Boodh, Dhurma, and Sunga, in Boodhist\r\ntheology. All were on foot, indeed ponies are seldom used in this\r\ncountry; the Lamas, however, walked with becoming gravity and\r\nindifference to all around them.\r\n\r\nThe Kajee waited upon me in the evening; full of importance, having\r\njust received a letter from his Rajah, which he wished to communicate\r\nto me in private; so I accompanied him to a house close by, where he\r\nwas a guest, when the secret came out, that his highness was dreadfully\r\nalarmed at my coming with the two Ghorka Sepoys, whom I accordingly\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nThe house was of the usual Bhoteea form, of wood, well built on posts,\r\none-storied, containing a single apartment hung round with bows,\r\nquivers, shields, baskets of rice, and cornucopias of Indian corn, the\r\nhandsomest and most generous looking of all the Cerealia. The whole\r\nparty were deep in a carouse on Murwa beer, and I saw the operation of\r\nmaking it. The millet-seed is moistened, and ferments for two days:\r\nsufficient for a day’s allowance is then put into a vessel of\r\nwicker-work, lined with India-rubber to make it water-tight; and\r\nboiling water is poured on it with a ladle of gourd, from a huge iron\r\ncauldron that stands all day over the fire. The fluid, when quite\r\nfresh, tastes like negus of Cape sherry, rather sour. At this season\r\nthe whole population are swilling, whether at home or travelling, and\r\nheaps of the red-brown husks are seen by the side of all the paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sikkim Lamas with praying cylinder and dorje; the\r\nlateral figures are monks or gylongs]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nRaklang pass—Uses of nettles—Edible plants—Lepcha war—Do- mani\r\nstone—Neongong—Teesta valley—Pony, saddle, etc.—Meet\r\nCampbell—Vegetation and scenery—Presents—Visit of Dewan—Characters of\r\nRajah and Dewan—Accounts of Tibet—Lhassa—Siling—Tricks of Dewan—Walk up\r\nTeesta—Audience of Rajah—Lamas—Kajees—Tchebu Lama, his character and\r\nposition—Effects of interview—Heir-apparent—Dewan’s\r\nhouse—Guitar—Weather—Fall of river—Tibet officers—Gigantic\r\ntrees—Neongong lake—Mainom, ascent of—Vegetation—Camp on snow—Silver\r\nfire—View from top—Kinchin, etc.—Geology—Vapours—Sunset\r\neffect—Elevation—Temperature, etc.—Lamas of Neongong—Temples—Religious\r\nfestival—Bamboo, flowering—Recross pass of Raklang—Numerous temples,\r\nvillages, etc.—Domestic animals—Descent to Great Rungeet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, after receiving the usual presents from the\r\nLamas of Dholing, and from a large posse of women belonging to the\r\nvillage of Barphiung, close by, we ascended the Raklang pass, which\r\ncrosses the range dividing the waters of the Teesta from those of the\r\nGreat Rungeet. The Kajee still kept beside me, and proved a lively\r\ncompanion: seeing me continually plucking and noting plants, he gave me\r\nmuch local information about them. He told me the uses made of the\r\nfibres of the various nettles; some being twisted for bowstrings,\r\nothers as a thread for sewing and weaving; while many are eaten raw and\r\nin soups, especially the numerous little succulent species. The great\r\nyellow-flowered _Begonia_ was abundant, and he cut its juicy stalks to\r\nmake sauce (as we do apple-sauce) for some pork which he expected to\r\nget at Bhomsong; the taste is acid and very pleasant. The large\r\nsucculent fern, called _Botrychium,_[94] grew here plentifully; it is\r\nboiled and eaten, both here and in New Zealand. Ferns are more commonly\r\nused for food than is supposed. In Calcutta the Hindoos boil young tops\r\nof a _Polypodium_ with their shrimp curries; and both in Sikkim and\r\nNepal the watery tubers of an _Aspidium_ are abundantly eaten. So also\r\nthe pulp of one tree-fern affords food, but only in times of scarcity,\r\nas does that of another species in New Zealand (_Cyathea medullaris_):\r\nthe pith of all is composed of a coarse sago, that is to say, of\r\ncellular tissue with starch granules.\r\n\r\n [94] _Botrychium Virginicum,_ Linn. This fern is eaten abundantly by\r\n the New Zealanders: its distribution is most remarkable, being found\r\n very rarely indeed in Europe, and in Norway only. It abounds in many\r\n parts of the Southern United States, the Andes of Mexico, etc., in the\r\n Himalaya mountains, Australia, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nA thick forest of Dorjiling vegetation covers the summit, which is only\r\n6,800 feet above the sea: it is a saddle, connecting the lofty mountain\r\nof Mainom (alt. 11,000 feet) to the north, with Tendong (alt. 8,663\r\nfeet) to the south. Both these mountains are on a range which is\r\ncontinuous with Kinchinjunga, projecting from it down into the very\r\nheart of Sikkim. A considerable stand was made here by the Lepchas\r\nduring the Nepal war in 1787; they defended the pass with their arrows\r\nfor some hours, and then retired towards the Teesta, making a second\r\nstand lower down, at a place pointed out to me, where rocks on either\r\nside gave them the same advantages. The Nepalese, however, advanced to\r\nthe Teesta, and then retired with little loss.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a thick mist and heavy rain cut off all view of the\r\nTeesta valley, and the mountains of Chola to the eastward; which I much\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\nDescending by a very steep, slippery path, we came to a fine mass of\r\nslaty gneiss, thirty feet long and thirteen feet high; not _in situ,_\r\nbut lying on the mountain side: on its sloping face was carved in\r\nenormous characters, “Om Mani Padmi om”; of which letters the\r\ntop-strokes afford an uncertain footing to the enthusiast who is\r\nwilling to purchase a good metempsychosis by walking along the slope,\r\nwith his heels or toes in their cavities. A small inscription in one\r\ncorner is said to imply that this was the work of a pious monk of\r\nRaklang; and the stone is called “Do-mani,” literally, “stone of\r\nprayer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Do-mani stone]\r\n\r\nThe rocks and peaks of Mainom are said to overhang the descent here\r\nwith grandeur; but the continued rain hid everything but a curious\r\nshivered peak, apparently of chlorite schist, which was close by, and\r\nreflected a green colour it is of course reported to be of turquoise,\r\nand inaccessible. Descending, the rocks became more micaceous, with\r\nbroad seams of pipe-clay, originating in decomposed beds of felspathic\r\ngneiss: the natives used this to whitewash and mortar their temples.\r\n\r\nI passed the monastery of Neongong, the monks of which were building a\r\nnew temple; and came to bring me a large present. Below it is a pretty\r\nlittle lake, about 100 yards across, fringed with brushwood. We camped\r\nat the village of Nampok, 4,370 feet above the sea; all thoroughly\r\nsodden with rain.\r\n\r\nDuring the night much snow had fallen at and above 9000 feet, but the\r\nweather cleared on the following morning, and disclosed the top of\r\nMainom, rising close above my camp, in a series of rugged shivered\r\npeaks, crested with pines, which looked like statues of snow: to all\r\nother quarters this mountain presents a very gently sloping outline. Up\r\nthe Teesta valley there was a pretty peep of snowy mountains, bearing\r\nnorth 35° east, of no great height.\r\n\r\nI was met by a messenger from Dr. Campbell who told me he was waiting\r\nbreakfast; so I left my party, and, accompanied by the Kajee and Meepo,\r\nhurried down to the valley of the Rungoon (which flows east to the\r\nTeesta), through a fine forest of tropical trees; passing the villages\r\nof Broom[95] and Lingo, to the spur of that name; where I was met by a\r\nservant of the Sikkim Dewan’s, with a pony for my use. I stared at the\r\nanimal, and felt inclined to ask what he had to do here, where it was\r\ndifficult enough to walk up and down slippery slopes, amongst boulders\r\nof rock, heavy forest, and foaming torrents; but I was little aware of\r\nwhat these beasts could accomplish. The Tartar saddle was imported from\r\nTibet, and certainly a curiosity; once—but a long time ago—it must have\r\nbeen very handsome; it was high-peaked, covered with shagreen and\r\nsilvered ornaments, wretchedly girthed, and with great stirrups\r\nattached to short leathers. The bridle and head-gear were much too\r\ncomplicated for description; there were good leather, raw hide,\r\nhair-rope, and scarlet worsted all brought into use; the bit was the\r\nordinary Asiatic one, jointed, and with two rings. I mounted on one\r\nside, and at once rolled over, saddle and all, to the other; the pony\r\nstanding quite still. I preferred walking; but Dr. Campbell had begged\r\nof me to use the pony, as the Dewan had procured and sent it at great\r\ntrouble: I, however, had it led till I was close to Bhomsong, when I\r\nwas hoisted into the saddle and balanced on it, with my toes in the\r\nstirrups and my knees up to my breast; twice, on the steep descent to\r\nthe river, my saddle and I were thrown on the pony’s neck; in these\r\nawkward emergencies I was assisted by a man on each side, who supported\r\nmy weight on my elbows: they seemed well accustomed to easing mounted\r\nponies down hill without giving the rider the trouble of dismounting.\r\nThus I entered Dr. Campbell’s camp at Bhomsong, to the pride and\r\ndelight of my attendants; and received a hearty welcome from my old\r\nfriend, who covered me with congratulations on the successful issue of\r\na journey which, at this season, and under such difficulties and\r\ndiscouragements, he had hardly thought feasible.\r\n\r\n [95] On the top of the ridge above Broom, a tall stone is erected by\r\n the side of the path, covered with private marks, indicating the\r\n height of various individuals who are accustomed to measure themselves\r\n thus; there was but one mark above 5 feet 7 inches, and that was 6\r\n inches higher. It turned out to be Campbell’s, who had passed a few\r\n days before, and was thus proved to top the natives of Sikkim by a\r\n long way.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell’s tent was pitched in an orange-grove, occupying a flat on\r\nthe west bank of the Teesta, close to a small enclosure of pine-apples,\r\nwith a pomegranate tree in the middle. The valley is very narrow, and\r\nthe vegetation wholly tropical, consisting of two species of oak,\r\nseveral palms, rattan-cane (screw-pine), _Pandanus,_ tall grasses, and\r\nall the natives of dense hot jungles. The river is a grand feature,\r\nbroad, rocky, deep, swift, and broken by enormous boulders of rock; its\r\nwaters were of a pale opal green, probably from the materials of the\r\nsoft micaceous rocks through which it flows.\r\n\r\nA cane bridge crosses it,[96] but had been cut away (in feigned\r\ndistrust of us), and the long canes were streaming from their\r\nattachments on either shore down the stream, and a triangular raft of\r\nbamboo was plying instead, drawn to and fro by means of a strong cane.\r\n\r\n [96] Whence the name of Bhomsong Samdong, the latter word meaning\r\n bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after arriving I received a present from the Rajah, consisting of\r\na brick of Tibet tea, eighty pounds of rancid yak butter, in large\r\nsquares, done up in yak-hair cloth, three loads of rice, and one of\r\nMurwa for beer; rolls of bread,[97] fowls, eggs, dried plums, apricots,\r\njujubes, currants, and Sultana raisins, the latter fruits purchased at\r\nLhassa, but imported thither from western Tibet; also some trays of\r\ncoarse milk-white crystallised salt, as dug in Tibet.\r\n\r\n [97] These rolls, or rather, sticks of bread, are made in Tibet, of\r\n fine wheaten flour, and keep for a long time: they are sweet and good,\r\n but very dirtily prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening we were visited by the Dewan, the head and front of all\r\nour Sikkim difficulties, whose influence was paramount with the Rajah,\r\nowing to the age and infirmities of the latter, and his devotion to\r\nreligion, which absorbed all his time and thoughts. The Dewan was a\r\ngood-looking Tibetan, very robust, fair, muscular and well fleshed; he\r\nhad a very broad Tartar face, quite free of hair; a small and\r\nbeautifully formed mouth and chin, very broad cheekbones, and a low,\r\ncontracted forehead: his manners were courteous and polite, but\r\nevidently affected, in assumption of better breeding than he could in\r\nreality lay claim to. The Rajah himself was a Tibetan of just\r\nrespectable extraction, a native of the Sokpo province, north of\r\nLhassa: his Dewan was related to one of his wives, and I believe a\r\nLhassan by birth as well as extraction, having probably also Kashmir\r\nblood in him.[98] Though minister, he was neither financier nor\r\npolitician, but a mere plunderer of Sikkim, introducing his relations,\r\nand those whom he calls so, into the best estates in the country, and\r\ntrading in great and small wares, from a Tibet pony to a tobacco pipe,\r\nwholesale and retail. Neither he nor the Rajah are considered worthy of\r\nnotice by the best Tibet families or priests, or by the Chinese\r\ncommissioners settled in Lhassa and Jigatzi. The latter regard Sikkim\r\nas virtually English, and are contented with knowing that its ruler has\r\nno army, and with believing that its protectors, the English, could not\r\nmarch an army across the Himalaya if they would.\r\n\r\n [98] The Tibetans court promiscuous intercourse between their families\r\n and the Kashmir merchants who traverse their country.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dewan, trading in wares which we could supply better and cheaper,\r\nnaturally regarded us with repugnance, and did everything in his power\r\nto thwart Dr. Campbell’s attempts to open a friendly communication\r\nbetween the Sikkim and English governments. The Rajah owed everything\r\nto us, and was, I believe, really grateful; but he was a mere cipher in\r\nthe hands of his minister. The priests again, while rejoicing in our\r\nproximity, were apathetic, and dreaded the more active Dewan; and the\r\npeople had long given evidence of their confidence in the English.\r\nUnder these circumstances it was in the hope of gaining the Rajah’s own\r\near, and representing to him the advantages of promoting an intercourse\r\nwith us, and the danger of continuing to violate the terms of our\r\ntreaty, that Dr. Campbell had been authorised by government to seek an\r\ninterview with His Highness. At present our relations were singularly\r\ninfelicitous. There was no agent on the Sikkim Rajah’s part to conduct\r\nbusiness at Dorjiling, and the Dewan insisted on sending a creature of\r\nhis own, who had before been dismissed for insolence. Malefactors who\r\nescaped into Sikkim were protected, and our police interrupted in the\r\ndischarge of their duties; slavery was practised; and government\r\ncommunications were detained for weeks and months under false\r\npretences.\r\n\r\nIn his interviews with us the Dewan appeared to advantage: he was fond\r\nof horses and shooting, and prided himself on his hospitality. We\r\ngained much information from many conversations with him, during which\r\npolitics were never touched upon. Our queries naturally referred to\r\nTibet and its geography, especially its great feature the Yarou Tsampoo\r\nriver; this he assured us was the Burrampooter of Assam, and that no\r\none doubted it in that country. Lhassa he described as a city in the\r\nbottom of a flat-floored valley, surrounded by lofty snowy mountains:\r\nneither grapes, tea, silk, or cotton are produced near it, but in the\r\nTartchi province of Tibet, one month’s journey east of Lhassa, rice,\r\nand a coarse kind of tea are both grown. Two months’ journey north-east\r\nof Lhassa is Siling, the well-known great commercial entrepôt[99] in\r\nwest China; and there coarse silk is produced. All Tibet he described\r\nas mountainous, and an inconceivably poor country: there are no plains,\r\nsave flats in the bottoms of the valleys, and the paths lead over lofty\r\nmountains. Sometimes, when the inhabitants are obliged from famine to\r\nchange their habitations in winter, the old and feeble are frozen to\r\ndeath, standing and resting their chins on their staves; remaining as\r\npillars of ice, to fall only when the thaw of the ensuing spring\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\n [99] The entrepôt is now removed to Tang-Keou-Eul.—See Huc and Gabet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remained several days at Bhomsong, awaiting an interview with the\r\nRajah, whose movements the Dewan kept shrouded in mystery. On Dr.\r\nCampbell’s arrival at this river a week before, he found messengers\r\nwaiting to inform him that the Rajah would meet him here; this being\r\nhalf way between Dorjiling and Tumloong. Thenceforward every subterfuge\r\nwas resorted to by the Dewan to frustrate the meeting; and even after\r\nthe arrival of the Rajah on the east bank, the Dewan communicated with\r\nDr. Campbell by shooting across the river arrows to which were attached\r\nletters, containing every possible argument to induce him to return to\r\nDorjiling; such as that the Rajah was sick at Tumloong, that he was\r\ngone to Tibet, that he had a religious fast and rites to perform, etc.\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOne day we walked up the Teesta to the Rumphiup river, a torrent from\r\nMainom mountain to the west; the path led amongst thick jungle of\r\n_Wallichia_ palm, prickly rattan canes, and the _Pandanus,_ or\r\nscrew-pine, called “Borr,” which has a straight, often forked,\r\npalm-like trunk, and an immense crown of grassy saw-edged leaves four\r\nfeet long: it bears clusters of uneatable fruit as large as a man’s\r\nfist, and their similarity to the pine-apple has suggested the name of\r\n“Borr” for the latter fruit also, which has for many years been\r\ncultivated in Sikkim, and yields indifferent produce. Beautiful pink\r\nbalsams covered the ground, but at this season few other showy plants\r\nwere in flower: the rocks were chlorite, very soft and silvery, and so\r\ncuriously crumpled and contorted as to appear as though formed of\r\nscaled of mica crushed together, and confusedly arranged in layers: the\r\nstrike was north-west, and dip north-east from 60° to 70°.\r\n\r\nMessengers from the Dewan overtook us at the river to announce that the\r\nRajah was prepared and waiting to give us a reception; so we returned,\r\nand I borrowed a coat from Dr. Campbell instead of my tattered\r\nshooting-jacket; and we crossed the river on the bamboo-raft. As it is\r\nthe custom on these occasions to exchange presents, I was officially\r\nsupplied with some red cloth and beads: these, as well as Dr.\r\nCampbell’s present, should only have been delivered during or after the\r\naudience; but our wily friend the Dewan here played us a very shabby\r\ntrick; for he managed that our presents should be stealthily brought in\r\nbefore our appearance, thus giving to the by-standers the impression of\r\nour being tributaries to his Highness!\r\n\r\nThe audience chamber was a mere roofed shed of neat bamboo wattle,\r\nabout twenty feet long: two Bhoteeas in scarlet jackets, and with bows\r\nin their hands, stood on each side of the door, and our own chairs were\r\ncarried before us for our accommodation. Within was a square wicker\r\nthrone, six feet high, covered with purple silk, brocaded with dragons\r\nin white and gold, and overhung by a canopy of tattered blue silk, with\r\nwhich material part of the walls also was covered. An oblong box\r\n(containing papers) with gilded dragons on it, was placed on the stage\r\nor throne, and behind it was perched cross-legged, an odd, black,\r\ninsignificant looking old man, with twinkling upturned eyes: he was\r\nswathed in yellow silk, and wore on his head a pink silk hat with a\r\nflat broad crown, from all sides of which hung floss silk. This was the\r\nRajah, a genuine Tibetan, about seventy years old. On some steps close\r\nby, and ranged down the apartment, were his relations, all in brocaded\r\nsilk robes reaching from the throat to the ground, and girded about the\r\nwaist; and wearing caps similar to that of the Rajah. Kajees,\r\ncounsellors, and shaven mitred Lamas were there, to the number of\r\ntwenty, all planted with their backs to the wall, mute and motionless\r\nas statues. A few spectators were huddled together at the lower end of\r\nthe room, and a monk waved about an incense pot containing burning\r\njuniper and other odoriferous plants. Altogether the scene was solemn\r\nand impressive: as Campbell well expressed it, the genius of Lamaism\r\nreigned supreme.\r\n\r\nWe saluted, but received no complimentary return; our chairs were then\r\nplaced, and we seated ourselves, when the Dewan came in, clad in a\r\nsuperb purple silk robe, worked with circular gold figures, and\r\nformally presented us. The Dewan then stood; and as the Rajah did not\r\nunderstand Hindoostanee, our conversation was carried on through the\r\nmedium of a little bare-headed rosy-cheeked Lama, named “Tchebu,” clad\r\nin a scarlet gown, who acted as interpreter. The conversation was short\r\nand constrained: Tchebu was known as a devoted servant of the Rajah and\r\nof the heir apparent; and in common with all the Lamas he hates the\r\nDewan, and desires a friendly intercourse between Sikkim and Dorjiling.\r\nHe is, further, the only servant of the Rajah capable of conversing\r\nboth in Hindoo and Tibetan, and the uneasy distrustful look of the\r\nDewan, who understands the latter language only, was very evident. He\r\nwas as anxious to hurry over the interview, as Dr. Campbell and Tchebu\r\nwere to protract it; it was clear, therefore, that nothing satisfactory\r\ncould be done under such auspices.\r\n\r\nAs a signal for departure white silk scarfs were thrown over our\r\nshoulders, according to the established custom in Tibet, Sikkim, and\r\nBhotan; and presents were made to us of China silks, bricks of tea,\r\nwoollen cloths, yaks, ponies, and salt, with worked silk purses and\r\nfans for Mrs. Campbell; after which we left. The whole scene was novel\r\nand very curious. We had had no previous idea of the extreme poverty of\r\nthe Rajah, of his utter ignorance of the usages of Oriental life, and\r\nof his not having anyone near to instruct him. The neglect of our\r\nsalutation, and the conversion of our presents into tribute, did not\r\narise from any ill-will: it was owing to the craft of the Dewan in\r\ntaking advantage of the Rajah’s ignorance of his own position and of\r\ngood manners. Miserably poor, without any retinue, taking no interest\r\nin what passes in his own kingdom, subsisting on the plainest and\r\ncoarsest food, passing his time in effectually abstracting his mind\r\nfrom the consideration of earthly things, and wrapt in contemplation,\r\nthe Sikkim Rajah has arrived at great sanctity, and is all but prepared\r\nfor that absorption into the essence of Boodh, which is the end and aim\r\nof all good Boodhists. The mute conduct of his Court, who looked like\r\nattendants at an inquisition, and the profound veneration expressed in\r\nevery word and gesture of those who did move and speak, recalled a\r\nPekin reception. His attendants treated him as a being of a very\r\ndifferent nature from themselves; and well might they do so, since they\r\nbelieve that he will never die, but retire from the world only to\r\nre-appear under some equally sainted form.\r\n\r\nThough productive of no immediate good, our interview had a very\r\nfavourable effect on the Lamas and people, who had long wished it; and\r\nthe congratulations we received thereon during the remainder of our\r\nstay in Sikkim were many and sincere. The Lamas we found universally in\r\nhigh spirits; they having just effected the marriage of the heir\r\napparent, himself a Lama, said to possess much ability and prudence,\r\nand hence being very obnoxious to the Dewan, who vehemently opposed the\r\nmarriage. As, however, the minister had established his influence over\r\nthe youngest, and estranged the Rajah from his eldest son, and was\r\nmoreover in a fair way for ruling Sikkim himself, the Church rose in a\r\nbody, procured a dispensation from Lhassa for the marriage of a priest,\r\nand thus hoped to undermine the influence of the violent and greedy\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, we paid a farewell visit to the Dewan, whom we found in\r\na bamboo wicker-work hut, neatly hung with bows, arrows, and round\r\nLepcha shields of cane, each with a scarlet tuft of yak-hair in the\r\nmiddle; there were also muskets, Tibetan arms, and much horse gear; and\r\nat one end was a little altar, with cups, bells, pastiles, and images.\r\nHe was robed in a fawn-coloured silk gown, lined with the softest of\r\nwool, that taken from unborn lambs: like most Tibetans, he extracts all\r\nhis beard with tweezers; an operation he civilly recommended to me,\r\naccompanying the advice with the present of a neat pair of steel\r\nforceps. He aspires to be considered a man of taste, and plays the\r\nTibetan guitar, on which he performed some airs for our amusement: the\r\ninstrument is round-bodied and long-armed, with six strings placed in\r\npairs, and probably comes from Kashmir: the Tibetan airs were simple\r\nand quite pretty, with the time well marked.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Bhomsong, the weather was cool, considering the low\r\nelevation (1,500 feet), and very steady; the mean temperature was\r\n52·25°, the maximum 71·25°, the minimum 42·75°. The sun set behind the\r\nlofty mountains at 3 p.m., and in the morning a thick, wet, white,\r\ndripping fog settled in the bottom of the valley, and extended to 800\r\nor 1000 feet above the river-bed; this was probably caused by the\r\ndescent of cold currents into the humid gorge: it was dissipated soon\r\nafter sunrise, but formed again at sunset for a few minutes, giving\r\nplace to clear starlight nights.\r\n\r\nA thermometer sunk two feet seven inches, stood at 64°. The temperature\r\nof the water was pretty constant at 51°: from here to the plains of\r\nIndia the river has a nearly uniform fall of 1000 feet in sixty-nine\r\nmiles, or sixteen feet to a mile: were its course straight for the same\r\ndistance, the fall would be 1000 feet in forty miles, or twenty-five\r\nfeet to a mile.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell’s object being accomplished, he was anxious to make the\r\nbest use of the few days that remained before his return to Dorjiling,\r\nand we therefore arranged to ascend Mainom, and visit the principal\r\nconvents in Sikkim together, after which he was to return south, whilst\r\nI should proceed north to explore the south flank of Kinchinjunga. For\r\nthe first day our route was that by which I had arrived. We left on\r\nChristmas-day, accompanied by two of the Rajah’s, or rather Dewan’s\r\nofficers, of the ranks of Dingpun and Soupun, answering to those of\r\ncaptain and lieutenant; the titles were, however, nominal, the Rajah\r\nhaving no soldiers, and these men being profoundly ignorant of the\r\nmysteries of war or drill. They were splendid specimens of Sikkim\r\nBhoteeas (i.e. Tibetans, born in Sikkim, sometimes called Arrhats),\r\ntall, powerful, and well built, but insolent and bullying: the Dingpun\r\nwore the Lepcha knife, ornamented with turquoises, together with\r\nChinese chopsticks. Near Bhomsong, Campbell pointed out a hot bath to\r\nme, which he had seen employed: it consisted of a hollowed prostrate\r\ntree trunk, the water in which was heated by throwing in hot stones\r\nwith bamboo tongs. The temperature is thus raised to 114°, to which the\r\npatient submits at repeated intervals for several days, never leaving\r\ntill wholly exhausted. These baths are called “Sa-choo,” literally\r\n“hot-water,” in Tibetan.\r\n\r\nWe stopped to measure some splendid trees in the valley, and found the\r\ntrunk of one to be forty-five feet round the buttresses, and thirty\r\nfeet above them, a large size for the Himalaya: they were a species of\r\n_Terminalia (Pentaptera),_ and called by the Lepchas “Sillok-Kun,”\r\n“Kun” meaning tree.\r\n\r\nWe slept at Nampok, and the following morning commenced the ascent. On\r\nthe way we passed the temple and lake of Neongong; the latter is about\r\n400 yards round, and has no outlet. It contained two English plants,\r\nthe common duckweed (_Lemna minor_), and _Potamogeton natans_: some\r\ncoots were swimming in it, and having flushed a woodcock, I sent for my\r\ngun, but the Lamas implored us not to shoot, it being contrary to their\r\ncreed to take life wantonly.\r\n\r\nWe left a great part of our baggage at Neongong, as we intended to\r\nreturn there; and took up with us bedding, food, etc., for two days. A\r\npath hence up the mountain is frequented once a year by the Lamas, who\r\nmake a pilgrimage to the top for worship. The ascent was very gradual\r\nfor 4000 feet. We met with snow at the level of Dorjiling (7000 feet),\r\nindicating a colder climate than at that station, where none had\r\nfallen; the vegetation was, however, similar, but not so rich, and at\r\n8000 feet trees common also to the top of Sinchul appeared, with _R.\r\nHodgsoni,_ and the beautiful little winter-flowering primrose, _P.\r\npetiolaris,_ whose stemless flowers spread like broad purple stars on\r\nthe deep green foliage. Above, the path runs along the ridge of the\r\nprecipices facing the south-east, and here we caught a glimpse of the\r\ngreat valley of the Ryott, beyond the Teesta, with Tumloong, the\r\nRajah’s residence, on its north flank, and the superb snowy peak of\r\nChola at its head.\r\n\r\nOne of our coolies, loaded with crockery and various indispensables,\r\nhad here a severe fall, and was much bruised; he however recovered\r\nhimself, but not our goods.\r\n\r\nThe rocks were all of chlorite slate, which is not usual at this\r\nelevation; the strike was north-west, and dip north-east. At 9000 feet\r\nvarious shrubby rhododendrons prevailed, with mountain-ash, birch, and\r\ndwarf-bamboo; also _R. Falconeri,_ which grew from forty to fifty feet\r\nhigh. The snow was deep and troublesome, so we encamped at 9,800 feet,\r\nor 800 feet below the top, in a wood of _Pyrus, Magnolia,\r\nRhododendron,_ and bamboo. As the ground was deeply covered with snow,\r\nwe laid our beds on a thick layer of rhododendron twigs, bamboo, and\r\nmasses of a pendent moss.\r\n\r\nWe passed a very cold night, chiefly owing to damp, the temperature\r\nfalling to 24°. On the following morning we scrambled through the snow,\r\nreaching the summit after an hour’s very laborious ascent, and took up\r\nour quarters in a large wooden barn-like temple (_goompa_), built on a\r\nstone platform. The summit was very broad, but the depth of the snow\r\nprevented our exploring much, and the silver firs (_Abies Webbiana_)\r\nwere so tall, that no view could be obtained, except from the temple.\r\nThe great peak of Kinchinjunga is in part hidden by those of Pundim and\r\nNursing, but the panorama of snowy mountains is very grand indeed. The\r\neffect is quite deceptive; the mountains assuming the appearance of a\r\ncontinued chain, the distant snowy peaks being seemingly at little\r\nfurther distance than the nearer ones. The whole range (about\r\ntwenty-two miles nearer than at Dorjiling) appeared to rise uniformly\r\nand steeply out of black pine forests, which were succeeded by the\r\nrusset-brown of the rhododendron shrubs, and that again by tremendous\r\nprecipices and gulleys, into which descended mighty glaciers and\r\nperpetual snows. This excessive steepness is however only apparent,\r\nbeing due to foreshortening.\r\n\r\nThe upper 10,000 feet of Kinchin, and the tops of Pundim, Kubra, and\r\nJunnoo, are evidently of granite, and are rounded in outline: the lower\r\npeaks again, as those of Nursing, etc., present rugged pinnacles of\r\nblack and red stratified rocks, in many cases resting on white granite,\r\nto which they present a remarkable contrast. The general appearance was\r\nas if Kinchin and the whole mass of mountains clustered around it, had\r\nbeen up-heaved by white granite, which still forms the loftiest\r\nsummits, and has raised the black stratified rocks in some places to\r\n20,000 feet in numerous peaks and ridges. One range presented on every\r\nsummit a cap of black stratified rocks of uniform inclination and dip,\r\nstriking north-west, with precipitous faces to the south-west: this was\r\nclear to the naked eye, and more evident with the telescope, the range\r\nin question being only fifteen miles distant, running between Pundim\r\nand Nursing. The fact of the granite forming the greatest elevation\r\nmust not be hastily attributed to that igneous rock having burst\r\nthrough the stratified, and been protruded beyond the latter: it is\r\nmuch more probable that the upheaval of the granite took place at a\r\nvast depth, and beneath an enormous pressure of stratified rocks and\r\nperhaps of the ocean; since which period the elevation of the whole\r\nmountain chain, and the denudation of the stratified rocks, has been\r\nslowly proceeding.\r\n\r\nTo what extent denudation has thus lowered the peaks we dare scarcely\r\nform a conjecture; but considering the number and variety of the beds\r\nwhich in some places overlie the gneiss and granite, we may reasonably\r\nconclude that many thousand feet have been removed.\r\n\r\nIt is further assumable that the stratified rocks originally took the\r\nforms of great domes, or arches. The prevailing north-west strike\r\nthroughout the Himalaya vaguely indicates a general primary arrangement\r\nof the curves into waves, whose crests run north-west and south-cast;\r\nan arrangement which no minor or posterior forces have wholly\r\ndisturbed, though they have produced endless dislocations, and\r\nespecially a want of uniformity in the amount and direction of the dip.\r\nWhether the loftiest waves were the result of one great convulsion, or\r\nof a long-continued succession of small ones, the effect would be the\r\nsame, namely, that the strata over those points at which the granite\r\npenetrated the highest, would be the most dislocated, and the most\r\nexposed to wear during denudation.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the view of this superb scenery till noon, when the clouds\r\nwhich had obscured Dorjiling since morning were borne towards us by the\r\nsoutherly wind, rapidly closing in the landscape on all sides. At\r\nsunset they again broke, retreating from the northward, and rising from\r\nSinchul and Dorjiling last of all, whilst a line of vapour, thrown by\r\nperspective into one narrow band, seemed to belt the Singalelah range\r\nwith a white girdle, darkened to black where it crossed the snowy\r\nmountains; and it was difficult to believe that this belt did not\r\nreally hang upon the ranges from twenty to thirty miles off, against\r\nwhich it was projected; or that its true position was comparatively\r\nclose to the mountain on which we were standing, and was due to\r\ncondensation around its cool, broad, flat summit.\r\n\r\nAs usual from such elevations, sunset produced many beautiful effects.\r\nThe zenith was a deep blue, darkening opposite the setting sun, and\r\npaling over it into a peach colour, and that again near the horizon\r\npassing into a glowing orange-red, crossed by coppery streaks of\r\ncirrhus. Broad beams of pale light shot from the sun to the meridian,\r\ncrossing the moon and the planet Venus. Far south, through gaps in the\r\nmountains, the position of the plains of India, 10,000 feet below us,\r\nwas indicated by a deep leaden haze, fading upwards in gradually paler\r\nbands (of which I counted fifteen) to the clear yellow of the sunset\r\nsky. As darkness came on, the mists collected around the top of Mainom,\r\naccumulating on the windward side, and thrown off in ragged masses from\r\nthe opposite.\r\n\r\nThe second night we passed here was fine, and not very cold (the mean\r\ntemperature being 27° and we kept ourselves quite warm by pine-wood\r\nfires. On the following morning the sun tinged the sky of a lurid\r\nyellow-red: to the south-west, over the plains, the belts of leaden\r\nvapour were fewer (twelve being distinguishable) and much lower than on\r\nthe previous evening, appearing as if depressed on the visible horizon.\r\nHeavy masses of clouds nestled into all the valleys, and filled up the\r\nlarger ones, the mountain tops rising above them like islands.\r\n\r\nThe height of our position I calculated to be 10,613 feet. Colonel\r\nWaugh had determined that of the summit by trigonometry to be 10,702\r\nfeet, which probably includes the trees which cover it, or some rocky\r\npeaks on the broad and comparatively level surface.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of the twenty-four hours was 32·7° (max.\r\n41·5°/min. 27·2°), mean dew-point 29·7, and saturation 0·82. The\r\nmercury suddenly fell below the freezing point at sunset; and from\r\nearly morning the radiation was so powerful, that a thermometer exposed\r\non snow sank to 21·2°, and stood at 25·5°, at 10 a.m. The black bulb\r\nthermometer rose to 132°, at 9 a.m. on the 27th, or 94·2° above the\r\ntemperature of the air in the shade. I did not then observe that of\r\nradiation from snow; but if, as we may assume, it was not less than on\r\nthe following morning (21·2°), we shall have a difference of 148·6°\r\nFahr., in contiguous spots; the one exposed to the full effects of the\r\nsun, the other to that of radiation through a rarefied medium to a\r\ncloudless sky. On the 28th the black bulb thermometer, freely suspended\r\nover the snow and exposed to the sun, rose to 108°, or 78° above that\r\nof the air in the shade (32°); the radiating surface of the same snow\r\nin the shade being 21·2°, or 86·8° colder.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a complete set of angles and panoramic sketches from the\r\ntop of Mainom, with seventeen hourly observations, and collected much\r\ninformation from our guides, we returned on the 28th to our tents\r\npitched by the temples at Neongong; descending 7000 feet, a very severe\r\nshake along Lepcha paths. In the evening the Lamas visited us, with\r\npresents of rice, fowls, eggs, etc., and begged subscriptions for their\r\ntemple which was then building, reminding Dr. Campbell that he and the\r\nGovernor-General had an ample share of their prayers, and benefited in\r\nproportion. As for me, they said, I was bound to give alms, as I surely\r\nneeded praying for, seeing how I exposed myself; besides my having been\r\nthe first Englishman who had visited the snows of Kinchinjunga, the\r\nholiest spot in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we visited the unfinished temple. The outer\r\nwalls were of slabs of stone neatly chiselled, but badly mortared with\r\nfelspathic clay and pounded slate, instead of lime; the partition walls\r\nwere of clay, shaped in moulds of wood; parallel planks, four feet\r\nasunder, being placed in the intended position of the walls, and left\r\nopen above, the composition was placed in these boxes, a little at a\r\ntime, and rammed down by the feet of many men, who walked round and\r\nround the narrow enclosure, singing, and also using rammers of heavy\r\nwood. The outer work was of good hard timber, of Magnolia (“Pendre-kun”\r\nof the Lepchas) land oak (“Sokka”). The common “Ban,” or Lepcha knife,\r\nsupplied the place of axe, saw, adze, and plane; and the graving work\r\nwas executed with small tools, chiefly on Toon (_Cedrela_), a very soft\r\nwood (the “Simal-kun” of the Lepchas).\r\n\r\nThis being a festival day, when the natives were bringing offerings to\r\nthe altar, we also visited the old temple, a small wooden building.\r\nBesides more substantial offerings, there were little cones of rice\r\nwith a round wafer of butter at the top, ranged on the altar in\r\norder.[100] Six Lamas were at prayer, psalms, and contemplation,\r\nsitting cross-legged on two small benches that ran down the building:\r\none was reading, with his hand and fore-finger elevated, whilst the\r\nothers listened; anon they all sang hymns, repeated sacred or silly\r\nprecepts to the bystanders, or joined in a chorus with boys, who struck\r\nbrass cymbals, and blew straight copper trumpets six feet long, and\r\nconch-shells mounted with broad silver wings, elegantly carved with\r\ndragons. There were besides manis, or praying-cylinders, drums, gongs,\r\nbooks, and trumpets made of human thigh-bones, plain or mounted in\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n [100] The worshippers, on entering, walk straight up to the altar, and\r\n before, or after, having deposited their gifts, they lift both hands\r\n to the forehead, fall on their knees, and touch the ground three times\r\n with both head and hands, raising the body a little between each\r\n prostration. They then advance to the head Lama, kotow similarly to\r\n him, and he blesses them, laying both hands on their heads and\r\n repeating a short formula. Sometimes the dorje is used in blessing, as\r\n the cross is in Europe, and when a mass of people request a\r\n benediction, the Lama pronounces it from the door of the temple with\r\n outstretched arms, the people all being prostrate, with their\r\n foreheads touching the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout Sikkim, we were roused each morning at daybreak by this wild\r\nmusic, the convents being so numerous that we were always within\r\nhearing of it. To me it was always deeply impressive, sounding so\r\nforeign, and awakening me so effectually to the strangeness of the wild\r\nland in which I was wandering, and of the many new and striking objects\r\nit contained. After sleep, too, during which the mind has either been\r\nat rest, or carried away to more familiar subjects, the feelings of\r\nloneliness and sometimes even of despondency, conjured up, by this\r\nsolemn music, were often almost oppressive.\r\n\r\nAscending from Neongong, we reached that pass from the Teesta to the\r\nGreat Rungeet, which I had crossed on the 22nd; and this time we had a\r\nsplendid view, down both the valleys, of the rivers, and the many spars\r\nfrom the ridge communicating between Tendong and Mainom, with many\r\nscattered villages and patches of cultivation. Near the top I found a\r\nplant of “Praong,” (a small bamboo), in full seed; this sends up many\r\nflowering branches from the root, and but few leaf-bearing ones; and\r\nafter maturing its seed, and giving off suckers from the root, the\r\nparent plant dies. The fruit is a dark, long grain, like rice; it is\r\nboiled and made into cakes, or into beer, like Murwa.\r\n\r\nLooking west from the summit, no fewer than ten monastic establishments\r\nwith their temples, villages and cultivation, were at once visible, in\r\nthe valley of the Great Rungeet, and in those of its tributaries;\r\nnamely, Changachelling, Raklang, Dholi, Molli, Catsuperri, Dhoobdi,\r\nSunnook, Powhungri, Pemiongchi and Tassiding, all of considerable size,\r\nand more or less remarkable in their sites, being perched on spurs or\r\npeaks at elevations varying from 3000 to 7000 feet, and commanding\r\nsplendid prospects.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at Lingcham, where I had halted on the 21st, and the\r\nweather being fine, I took bearings of all the convents and mountains\r\naround. There is much cultivation here, and many comparatively rich\r\nvillages, all occupying flat-shouldered spurs from Mainom. The houses\r\nare large, and the yards are full of animals familiar to the eye but\r\nnot to the ear. The cows of Sikkim, though generally resembling the\r\nEnglish in stature, form, and colour, have humps, and grunt rather than\r\nlow; and the cocks wake the morning with a prolonged howling screech,\r\ninstead of the shrill crow of chanticleer.\r\n\r\nHence we descended north-west to the Great Rungeet, opposite Tassiding;\r\nwhich is one of the oldest monastic establishments in Sikkim, and one\r\nwe were very anxious to visit. The descent lay through a forest of\r\ntropical trees, where small palms, vines, peppers, _Pandanus,_ wild\r\nplantain, and _Pothos,_ were interlaced in an impenetrable jungle, and\r\nair-plants clothed the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Implements used in Boodhist temples]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nTassiding, view of and from—Funereal cypress—Camp at Sunnook—Hot\r\nvapours—Lama’s house—Temples, decorations, altars, idols, general\r\neffect—Chaits—Date of erection—Plundered by Ghorkas—Cross Ratong—Ascend\r\nto Pemiongchi—Relation of river-beds to strike of rocks—Slopes of\r\nravines—Pemiongchi, view of—Vegetation—Elevation—Temple, decorations,\r\netc.—Former capital of Sikkim—History of Sikkim—Nightingales—Campbell\r\ndeparts—Tchonpong—Edgeworthia—Cross Rungbee and Ratong—Hoar-frost on\r\nplantains—Yoksun—Walnuts—View—Funereal cypresses—Doobdi—Gigantic\r\ncypresses—Temples—Snow-fall—Sikkim, etc.—Toys.\r\n\r\n\r\nTassiding hill is the steep conical termination of a long spur from a\r\npine-clad shoulder of Kinchinjunga, called Powhungri: it divides the\r\nGreat Rungeet from its main feeder, the Ratong, which rises from the\r\nsouth face of Kinchin. We crossed the former by a bridge formed of two\r\nbamboo stems, slung by canes from two parallel arches of stout branches\r\nlashed together.\r\n\r\nThe ascent for 2,800 feet was up a very steep, dry, zigzag path,\r\namongst mica slate rocks (strike north-east), on which grew many\r\ntropical plants, especially the “Tukla,” (_Rottlera tinctoria_), a\r\nplant which yields a brown dye. The top was a flat, curving north-west\r\nand south-east, covered with temples, chaits, and mendongs of the most\r\npicturesque forms and in elegant groups, and fringed with brushwood,\r\nwild plantains, small palms, and apple-trees. Here I saw for the first\r\ntime the funereal cypress, of which some very old trees spread their\r\nweeping limbs and pensile branchlets over the buildings.[101] It is not\r\nwild in Sikkim, but imported there and into Bhotan from Tibet: it does\r\nnot thrive well above 6000 feet elevation. It is called “Tchenden” by\r\nthe Lepchas, Bhoteeas, and Tibetans, and its fragrant red wood is burnt\r\nin the temples.\r\n\r\n [101] I was not then aware of this tree having been introduced into\r\n England by the intrepid Mr. Fortune from China; and as I was unable to\r\n procure seeds, which are said not to ripen in Sikkim, it was a great\r\n and unexpected pleasure, on my return home, to find it alive and\r\n flourishing at Kew.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group of chaits at Tassiding]\r\n\r\nThe Lamas met us on the top of the hill, bringing a noble present of\r\nfowls, vegetables and oranges, the latter most acceptable after our\r\nlong and hot march. The site is admirably chosen, in the very heart of\r\nSikkim, commanding a fine view, and having a considerable river on\r\neither side, with the power of retreating behind to the convents of\r\nSunnook and Powhungri, which are higher up on the same spur, and\r\nsurrounded by forest enough to conceal an army. Considering the\r\nturbulent and warlike character of their neighbours, it is not\r\nwonderful that the monks should have chosen commanding spots, and good\r\nshelter for their indolent lives: for the same reason these monasteries\r\nsecured views of one another: thus from Tassiding the great temple of\r\nPemiongchi was seen towering 3000 feet over head, whilst to the\r\nnorth-west, up the course of the river, the hill-sides seemed sprinkled\r\nwith monasteries.\r\n\r\nWe camped on a saddle near the village of Sunnook, at 4000 feet above\r\nthe sea; and on the last day of the year we visited this most\r\ninteresting monastic establishment: ascending from our camp along the\r\nridge by a narrow path, cut here and there into steps, and passing many\r\nrocks covered with inscriptions, broken walls of mendongs, and other\r\nremains of the _via sacra_ between the village and temple. At one spot\r\nwe found a fissure emitting hot vapour of the temperature of 65·5°,\r\nthat of the air being about 50°. It was simply a hole amongst the\r\nrocks; and near the Rungeet a similar one is said to occur, whose\r\ntemperature fluctuates considerably with the season. It is very\r\nremarkable that such an isolated spring should exist on the top of a\r\nsharp ridge, 2,800 feet above the bottom of this deep valley.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement on the summit was, first the Lamas’ houses with\r\nsmall gardens, then three large temples raised on rudely paged\r\nplatforms, and beyond these, a square walled enclosure facing the\r\nsouth, full of chaits and mendongs, looking like a crowded cemetery,\r\nand planted with funereal cypress (_Cupressus funebris_).\r\n\r\nThe house of the principal Lama was an oblong square, the lower story\r\nof stone, and the upper of wood: we ascended a ladder to the upper\r\nroom, which was 24 feet by 8 wattled all round, with prettily latticed\r\nwindows opening upon a bamboo balcony used for drying grain, under the\r\neaves of the broad thatched roof. The ceiling (of neat bamboo work) was\r\nhung with glorious bunches of maize, yellow, red, and brown; an altar\r\nand closed wicker cage at one end of the room held the Penates, and a\r\nfew implements of worship. Chinese carpets were laid on the floor for\r\nus, and the cans of Murwa brought round.\r\n\r\nThe Lama, though one of the red sect, was dressed in a yellow flowered\r\nsilk robe, but his mitre was red: he gave us much information relative\r\nto the introduction of Boodhism into Sikkim.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Doorway]\r\n\r\nThe three temples stand about fifty yards apart, but are not parallel\r\nto one another, although their general direction is east and west.[102]\r\nEach is oblong, and narrowed upwards, with the door at one end; the\r\nmiddle (and smallest) faces the west, the others the east: the doorways\r\nare all broad, low and deep, protected by a projecting carved portico.\r\nThe walls are immensely thick, of well-masoned slaty stones; the outer\r\nsurface of each slopes upwards and inwards, the inner is perpendicular.\r\nThe roofs are low and thickly thatched, and project from eight to ten\r\nfeet all round, to keep off the rain, being sometimes supported by long\r\npoles. There is a very low upper story, inhabited by the attendant\r\nmonks and servants, accessible by a ladder at one end of the building.\r\nThe main body of the temple is one large apartment, entered through a\r\nsmall transverse vestibule, the breadth of the temple, in which are\r\ntall cylindrical praying-machines. The carving round the doors is very\r\nbeautiful, and they are gaudily painted and gilded. The northern temple\r\nis quite plain: the middle one is simply painted red, and encircled\r\nwith a row of black heads, with goggle eyes and numerous teeth, on a\r\nwhite ground; it is said to have been originally dedicated to the evil\r\nspirits of the Lepcha creed. The southern, which contains the library,\r\nis the largest and best, and is of an irregular square shape. The\r\ninside walls and floors are plastered with clay, and painted with\r\nallegorical representations of Boodh, etc. From the vestibule the\r\nprincipal apartment is entered by broad folding-doors, studded with\r\ncircular copper bosses, and turning on iron hinges. It is lighted by\r\nlatticed windows, sometimes protected outside by a bamboo screen. Owing\r\nto the great thickness of the walls (three to four feet), a very feeble\r\nlight is admitted. In the principal temple, called “Dugang,” six\r\nhexagonal wooden columns, narrowed above, with peculiar broad\r\ntransverse capitals, exquisitely gilded and painted, support the\r\ncross-beams of the roof, which are likewise beautifully ornamented.\r\nSometimes a curly-maned gilt lion is placed over a column, and it is\r\nalways furnished with a black bushy tail: squares, diamonds, dragons,\r\nand groups of flowers, vermilion, green, gold, azure, and white, are\r\ndispersed with great artistic taste over all the beams; the heavier\r\nmasses of colour being separated by fine white lines.\r\n\r\n [102] Timkowski, in his travels through Mongolia (i. p. 193), says,\r\n “According to the rules of Tibetan architecture, temples should face\r\n the south:” this is certainly not the rule in Sikkim, nor, so far as I\r\n could learn, in Tibet either.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Southern temple]\r\n\r\nThe altars and idols are placed at the opposite end; and two long\r\nparallel benches, like cathedral stalls, run down the centre of the\r\nbuilding: on these the monks sit at prayer and contemplation, the head\r\nLama occupying a stall (often of very tasteful design) near the altar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Middle temple]\r\n\r\nThe principal Boodh, or image, is placed behind the altar under a\r\ncanopy, or behind a silk screen: lesser gods, and gaily dressed and\r\npainted effigies of sainted male or female persons are ranged on either\r\nside, or placed in niches around the apartment, sometimes with separate\r\naltars before them; whilst the walls are more or less covered with\r\npaintings of monks in prayer or contemplation. The principal Boodh\r\n(Sakya Sing) sits cross-legged, with the left heel up: his left-hand\r\nalways rests on his thigh, and holds the padmi or lotus and jewel,\r\nwhich is often a mere cup; the right-hand is either raised, with the\r\ntwo forefingers up, or holds the dorje, or rests on the calf of the\r\nupturned leg. Sakya has generally curled hair, Lamas have mitres,\r\nfemales various head-dresses; most wear immense ear-rings, and some\r\nrosaries. All are placed on rude pediments, so painted as to convey the\r\nidea of their rising out of the petals of the pink, purple, or white\r\nlotus. None are in any way disagreeable; on the contrary most have a\r\ncalm and pleasing expression, suggestive of contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Altar and images]\r\n\r\nThe great or south temple contained a side altar of very elegant shape,\r\nplaced before an image encircled by a glory. Flowers, juniper,\r\npeacock’s feathers, pastiles, and rows of brass cups of water were the\r\nchief ornaments of the altars, besides the instruments I have elsewhere\r\nenumerated. In this temple was the library, containing several hundred\r\nbooks, in pigeon-holes, placed in recesses.[103]\r\n\r\n [103] For a particular account of the images and decorations of these\r\n temples, sea Dr. Campbell’s paper in “Bengal Asiatic Society’s\r\n Trans.,” May, 1849. The principal object of veneration amongst the\r\n Ningma or red sect of Boodhists in Sikkim and Bhotan is Gorucknath,\r\n who is always represented sitting cross-legged, holding the dorje in\r\n one hand, which is raised; whilst the left rests in the lap and holds\r\n a cup with a jewel in it. The left arm supports a trident, whose staff\r\n pierces three sculls (a symbol of Shiva), a rosary hangs round his\r\n neck, and he wears a red mitre with a lunar crescent and sun in front.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the south temple]\r\n\r\nThe effect on entering these cold and gloomy temples is very\r\nimpressive; the Dugang in particular is exquisitely ornamented and\r\npainted, and the vista from the vestibule to the principal idol, of\r\ncarved and coloured pillars and beams, is very picturesque. Within, the\r\ngeneral arrangement of the colours and gilding is felt to be harmonious\r\nand pleasing, especially from the introduction of slender white streaks\r\nbetween the contrasting masses of colour, as adopted in the Great\r\nExhibition building of 1851. It is also well worthy of remark that the\r\nbrightest colours are often used in broad masses, and when so, are\r\nalways arranged chromatically, in the sequence of the rainbow’s hues,\r\nand are hence never displeasing to the eye. The hues, though bright,\r\nare subdued by the imperfect light: the countenances of the images are\r\nall calm, and their expression solemn. Whichever way you turn, the eye\r\nis met by some beautiful specimen of colouring or carving, or some\r\nobject of veneration. The effect is much heightened by the incense of\r\njuniper and sweet-smelling herbs which the priests burn on entering, by\r\ntheir grave and decorous conduct, and by the feeling of respect that is\r\ndemanded by a religion which theoretically inculcates and adores virtue\r\nin the abstract, and those only amongst men who practise virtue. To the\r\nidol itself the Boodhist attaches no real importance; it is an object\r\nof reverence, not of worship, and no virtue or attribute belong to it\r\n_per se_; it is a symbol of the creed, and the adoration is paid to the\r\nholy man whom it represents.\r\n\r\nBeyond the temples are the chaits and mendongs, scattered without much\r\norder; and I counted nearly twenty-five cbaits of the same form,[104]\r\nbetween eight and thirty feet high. The largest is consecrated to the\r\nmemory of the Rajah’s eldest son, who, however, is not buried here. A\r\ngroup of these structures is, as I have often remarked, extremely\r\npicturesque, and those at Tassiding, from their number, variety, and\r\nsize, their commanding and romantic position, and their being\r\ninterspersed with weeping cypresses, are particularly so.\r\n\r\n [104] In Sikkim the form of the cube alone is always strictly\r\n preserved; that of the pyramid and hemisphere being often much\r\n modified. The cube stands on a flight of usually three steps, and is\r\n surmounted by a low pyramid of five steps; on this is placed a\r\n swelling, urn-shaped body, which represents the hemisphere, and is\r\n surmounted by another cube. On the latter is a slender, round or\r\n angled spire (represented by a pyramid in Burma), crowned with a\r\n crescent and disc, or sun, in moon. Generally, the whole is of stone,\r\n with the exception of the spire, which is of wood, painted red.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tassiding temples and convents were founded upwards of 300 years\r\nago, by the Lamas who accompanied the first Rajah to Sikkim; and they\r\nhave been continuously served by Lamas of great sanctity, many of whom\r\nhave been educated at Lhassa. They were formerly very wealthy, but\r\nduring the Nepal war they were plundered of all their treasures, their\r\nsilver gongs and bells, their best idols, dorjes, and manis, and\r\nstripped of their ornaments; since which time Pemiongchi has been more\r\npopular. In proof of their antiquity, it was pointed out that most of\r\nthe symbols and decorations were those of pure Lama Boodhism, as\r\npractised in Tibet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the elevation is but 4,840 feet, the weather was cold and raw,\r\nwith rain at noon, followed by thunder and lightning. These electrical\r\ndisturbances are frequent about midsummer and midwinter, prevailing\r\nover many parts of India.\r\n\r\n_January 1st, 1849._—The morning of the new year was bright and\r\nbeautiful, though much snow had fallen on the mountains; and we left\r\nSunnook for Pemiongchi, situated on the summit of a lofty spur on the\r\nopposite side of the Ratong. We descended very steeply to the bed of\r\nthe river (alt. 2,480 feet) which joins the Great Rungeet below the\r\nconvents. The rocks were micaceous, dipping west and north-west 45°,\r\nand striking north and north-east, which direction prevailed for 1000\r\nfeet or so up the opposite spur. I had observed the same dip and stroke\r\non the east flank of the Tassiding spur; but both the Ratong on its\r\nwest side, and the Great Rungeet on the east, flow in channels that\r\nshow no relation to either the dip or strike. I have generally remarked\r\nin Sikkim that the channels of the rivers when cutting through or\r\nflowing at the base of bluff cliffs, are neither parallel to nor at\r\nright angles to the strike of the rocks forming the cliffs. I do not\r\nhence conclude that there is no original connection between the\r\ndirections of the rivers, and the lines of fracture; but whatever may\r\nhave once subsisted between the direction of the fissures and that of\r\nthe strike, it is in the Sikkim Himalaya now wholly masked by\r\nshiftings, which accompanied subsequent elevations and depressions.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins has mathematically demonstrated that the continued exertion\r\nof a force in raising superimposed strata would tend to produce two\r\nclasses of fractures in those strata; those of the first order at right\r\nangles to the direction of the wave or ridge (or line of strike); those\r\nof the second order parallel to the strike. Supposing the force to be\r\nwithdrawn after the formation of the two fractures, the result would be\r\na ridge, or mountain chain, with diverging fissures from the summit,\r\ncrossed by concentric fissures; and the courses which the rivers would\r\ntake in flowing down the ridge, would successively be at right angles\r\nand parallel to the strike of the strata. Now, in the Himalaya, a\r\nprevalent strike to the north-west has been recognised in all parts of\r\nthe chain, but it is everywhere interfered with by mountains presenting\r\nevery other direction of strike, and by their dip never remaining\r\nconstant either in amount or direction. Consequently, as might be\r\nexpected, the directions of the river channels bear no apparent\r\nrelation to the general strike of the rocks.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Ratong (twenty yards broad) by a cane bridge, suspended\r\nbetween two rocks of green chlorite, full of veins of granite.\r\nAscending, we passed the village of Kameti on a spur, on the face of\r\nwhich were strewed some enormous detached blocks of white and pink\r\nstratified quartz: the rocks _in situ_ were all chlorite schist.\r\n\r\nLooking across the valley to the flank of Mainom, the disposition of\r\nthe ridges and ravines on its sides was very evident; many of the\r\nlatter, throughout their westerly course, from their commencement at\r\n10,000 feet, to their debouchure in the Great Rungeet at 2000, had a\r\nbluff, cliffy, northern flank, and a sloping southern one. The dip of\r\nthe surfaces is, therefore, north-west, the exposure consequently of\r\nthe villages which occupy terraces on the south flanks of the lateral\r\nvalleys. The Tassiding spur presented exactly the same arrangement of\r\nits ravines, and the dip of the rocks being north-west, it follows that\r\nthe planes of the sloping surfaces coincide in direction (though not in\r\namount of inclination) with that of the dip of the subjacent strata,\r\nwhich is anything but a usual phenomenon in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to Pemiongchi continued very steep, through woods of oaks,\r\nchesnuts, and magnolias, but no tree-fern, palms, _Pothos,_ or\r\nplantain, which abound at this elevation on the moister outer ranges of\r\nSikkim. The temple (elev. 7,083 feet) is large, eighty feet long, and\r\nin excellent order, built upon the lofty terminal point of the great\r\neast and west spur that divides the Kulhait from the Ratong and Rungbee\r\nrivers; and the great Changachelling temple and monastery stand on\r\nanother eminence of the same ridge, two miles further west.\r\n\r\nThe view of the snowy range from this temple is one of the finest in\r\nSikkim; the eye surveying at one glance the vegetation of the Tropics\r\nand the Poles. Deep in the valleys the river-beds are but 3000 feet\r\nabove the sea, and are choked with fig-trees, plantains, and palms; to\r\nthese succeed laurels and magnolias, and higher up still, oaks,\r\nchesnuts, birches, etc.; there is, however, no marked line between the\r\nlimits of these two last forests, which form the prevailing arboreous\r\nvegetation between 4000 and 10,000 feet, and give a lurid line to the\r\nmountains. Pine forests succeed for 2000 feet higher, when they give\r\nplace to a skirting of rhododendron and berberry. Among these appear\r\nblack naked rocks, rising up in cliffs, between which are gulleys, down\r\nwhich the snow now (on the 1st January) descended to 12,000 feet. The\r\nmountain flanks are much more steep and rocky than those at similar\r\nheights on the outer ranges, and cataracts are very numerous, and of\r\nconsiderable height, though small in volume.\r\n\r\nPemiongchi is at the same elevation as Dorjiling, and the contrast\r\nbetween the shoulders of 8000 to 10,000 feet on Kinchinjunga, and those\r\nof equal height on Tendong and Tonglo, is very remarkable: looking at\r\nthe latter mountains from Dorjiling, the observer sees no rock,\r\nwaterfall, or pine, throughout their whole height; whereas the equally\r\nwooded flanks of these inner ranges are rocky, streaked with\r\nthread-like waterfalls, and bristling with silver firs.\r\n\r\nThis temple, the most ancient in Sikkim, is said to be 400 years old;\r\nit stands on a paved platform, and is of the same form and general\r\ncharacter as those of Tassiding. Inside, it is most beautifully\r\ndecorated, especially the beams, columns, capitals and architraves, but\r\nthe designs are coarser than those of Tassiding.[105] The square end of\r\nevery beam in the roof is ornamented either with a lotus flower or with\r\na Tibetan character, in endless diversity of colour and form, and the\r\nwalls are completely covered with allegorical paintings of Lamas and\r\nsaints expounding or in contemplation, with glories round their heads,\r\nmitred, and holding the dole and jewel.\r\n\r\n [105] Mr. Hodgson informed me that many of the figures and emblems in\r\n this temple are those of Tantrica Boodhism, including Shiva, Devi, and\r\n other deities usually called Brahminical; Kakotak, or the snake king,\r\n a figure terminating below in a snake, is also seen; with the tiger,\r\n elephant, and curly-maned lion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior of the temple at Pemiongchi]\r\n\r\nThe principal image is a large and hideous figure of Sakya-thoba, in a\r\nrecess under a blue silk canopy, contrasting with a calm figure of the\r\nlate Rajah, wearing a cap and coronet.\r\n\r\nPemiongchi was once the capital of Sikkim, and called the Sikkim\r\nDurbar: the Rajah’s residence was on a curious flat to the south of the\r\ntemple, and a few hundred feet below it, where are the remains of (for\r\nthis country) extensive walls and buildings. During the Nepal war, the\r\nRajah was driven west across the Teesta, whilst the Ghorkas plundered\r\nTassiding, Pemiongchi, Changachelling, and all the temples and convents\r\nto the east of that river. It was then that the famous history of\r\nSikkim,[106] compiled by the Lamas of Pemiongchi, and kept at this\r\ntemple, was destroyed, with the exception of a few sheets, with one of\r\nwhich Dr. Campbell and myself were each presented. We were told that\r\nthe monks of Changachelling and those of this establishment had copied\r\nwhat remained, and were busy compiling from oral information, etc.:\r\nwhatever value the original may have possessed, however, is\r\nirretrievably lost. A magnificent copy of the Boodhist Scriptures was\r\ndestroyed at the same time; it consisted of 400 volumes, each\r\ncontaining several hundred sheets of Daphne paper.\r\n\r\n [106] This remarkable and beautiful manuscript was written on thick\r\n oblong sheets of Tibet paper, painted black to resist decay, and the\r\n letters were yellow and gold. The Nepalese soldiers wantonly employed\r\n the sheets to roof the sheds they erected, as a protection from the\r\n weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ground about the temple was snowed; and we descended a few hundred\r\nfeet, to encamp in a most picturesque grove, among chaits and inscribed\r\nstones, with a peep of the temples above. Nightingales warbled\r\ndeliciously night and morning, which rather surprised us, as the\r\nminimum thermometer fell to 27·8°, and the ground next day was covered\r\nwith hoar-frost; the elevation being 6,580 feet. These birds migrate\r\nhither in October and November, lingering in the Himalayan valleys till\r\nthe cold of early spring drives them further south, to the plains of\r\nIndia, whence they return north in March and April.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of January I parted from my friend, who was obliged to hurry\r\nto the great annual fair at Titalya. I regretted much being unable to\r\naccompany Dr. Campbell to this scene of his disinterested labours,\r\nespecially as the Nawab of Moorshedabad was to be present, one of the\r\nfew wealthy native princes of Bengal who still keep a court worth\r\nseeing; but I was more anxious to continue my explorations northward\r\ntill the latest moment: I however accompanied him for a short distance\r\non his way towards Dorjiling. We passed the old Durbar, called\r\nPhieungoong (“Bamboo-hill,” so named from the abundance of a small\r\nbamboo, “Phieung.”) The buildings, now in ruins, occupy a little marshy\r\nflat, hemmed in by slate rocks, and covered with brambles and\r\n_Andromeda_ bushes. A wall, a bastion, and an arched gateway, are the\r\nonly traces of fortifications; they are clothed with mosses, lichens,\r\nand ferns.\r\n\r\nA steep zigzag path, descending amongst long grass and scarlet\r\nrhododendrons, leads to the Kaysing Mendong.[107] Here I bade adieu to\r\nDr. Campbell, and toiled up the hill, feeling very lonely. The zest\r\nwith which he had entered into all my pursuits, and the aid he had\r\nafforded me, together with the charm that always attends companionship\r\nwith one who enjoys every incident of travel, had so attracted me to\r\nhim that I found it difficult to recover my spirits. It is quite\r\nimpossible for anyone who cannot from experience realise the solitary\r\nwandering life I had been leading for months, to appreciate the\r\ndesolate feeling that follows the parting from one who has heightened\r\nevery enjoyment, and taken far more than his share of every annoyance\r\nand discomfort: the few days we had spent together appeared then, and\r\nstill, as months.\r\n\r\n [107] Described at page 287.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return to Pemiongchi I spent the remainder of the day sketching\r\nin the great temple, gossiping with the Lamas, and drinking salted and\r\nbuttered tea-soup, which I had begun to like, when the butter was not\r\nrancid.\r\n\r\nMy route hence was to be along the south flank of Kinchinjunga, north\r\nto Jongri, which lay about four or five marches off, on the road to the\r\nlong deserted pass of Kanglanamo, by which I had intended entering\r\nSikkim from Nepal, when I found the route up the Yalloong valley\r\nimpracticable. The village and ruined convents of Yoksun lay near the\r\nroute, and the temples of Doobdi, Catsuperri and Molli, on the Ratong\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nI descended to the village of Tchonpong (alt. 4,980 feet), where I was\r\ndetained a day to obtain rice, of which I required ten days’ supply for\r\ntwenty-five people. On the way I passed groves of the paper-yielding\r\n_Edgeworthia Gardneri_: it bears round heads of fragrant, beautiful,\r\nyellow flowers, and would be a valuable acquisition to an English\r\nconservatory.\r\n\r\nFrom Tchonpong we descended to the bed of the Rungbee (alt. 3,160\r\nfeet), an affluent of the Ratong, flowing in a deep galley with\r\nprecipitous sides of mica schist full of garnets, dipping west and\r\nnorth-west 45°: it was spanned by a bridge of two loose bamboo culms,\r\nabout fifteen yards long, laid across without handrails; after wet sand\r\nhad been thrown on it the bare-footed coolies crossed easily enough,\r\nbut I, having shoes on, required a hand to steady me. From this point\r\nwe crossed a lofty spur to the Ratong (alt. 3000 feet), where we\r\nencamped, the coolies being unable to proceed further on such very bad\r\nroads. This river descends from the snows of Kinchin, and consequently\r\nretains the low temperature 42°, being fully 7° colder than the\r\nRungbee, which at an elevation of but 3000 feet appears very\r\nremarkable: it must however be observed that scarcely anywhere does the\r\nsun penetrate to the bottom of its valley.\r\n\r\nWe encamped on a gravelly flat, fifty feet above the river, strewn with\r\nwater-worn boulders, and so densely covered with tall _Artemisiæ,_\r\ngigantic grasses, bamboo, plantain, fern, and acacia, that we had to\r\nclear a space in the jungle, which exhaled a rank heavy smell.\r\n\r\nHoar-frost formed copiously in the night, and though above the sun’s\r\nrays were very powerful, they did not reach this spot till 7.30 a.m.,\r\nthe frost remaining in the shade till nearly 9 a.m.; and this on\r\nplantains, and other inhabitants of hot-houses in England.\r\n\r\nHence I ascended to Yoksun, one of the most curious and picturesque\r\nspots in Sikkim, and the last inhabited place towards Kinchinjunga. The\r\npath was excessively steep and rocky for the first mile or two, and\r\nthen alternately steep and flat. Mixed with many tropical trees, were\r\nwalnuts of the common English variety; a tree, which, though planted\r\nhere, is wild near Dorjiling, where it bears a full-sized fruit, as\r\nhard as a hickory-nut: those I gathered in this place were similar,\r\nwhereas in Bhotan the cultivated nut is larger, thin-shelled, and the\r\nkernel is easily removed. We ascended one slope, of an angle of 36°\r\n30′, which was covered with light black mould, and had been recently\r\ncleared by fire: we found millet now cultivated on it. From the top the\r\nview of the Ratong valley was very fine: to the north lay Yoksun,\r\nappearing from this height to occupy a flat, two miles long and one\r\nbroad, girdled by steep mountains to the north and east, dipping very\r\nsuddenly 2,200 feet to the Ratong on the west. To the right was a lofty\r\nhill, crowned with the large temple and convents of Doobdi, shadowed by\r\nbeautiful weeping cypresses, and backed by lofty pine-clad mountains.\r\nNorthward, the gorge of the Ratong opened as a gloomy defile, above\r\nwhich rose partially snowed mountains, which shut out Kinchinjunga. To\r\nthe west, massive pine-clad mountains rose steeply; while the little\r\nhamlet of Lathiang occupied a remarkable shelf overhanging the river,\r\nappearing inaccessible except by ropes from above. South-west, the long\r\nspurs of Molli and Catsuperri, each crowned with convents or temples,\r\ndescended from Singalelah; and parallel to them on the south; but much\r\nlonger and more lofty, was the great mountain range north of the\r\nKulbait, with the temples and convents of Pemiongchi, and\r\nChangachelling, towering in the air. The latter range dips suddenly to\r\nthe Great Rungeet, where Tassiding, with its chaits and cypresses,\r\nclosed the view. The day was half cloud, half sunshine; and the various\r\neffects of light and shade, now bringing out one or other of the\r\nvillages and temples, now casting the deep valleys into darker gloom,\r\nwas wonderfully fine.\r\n\r\nYoksun was the earliest civilised corner of Sikkim, and derived its\r\nname (which signifies in Lepcha “three chiefs”) from having been the\r\nresidence of three Lamas of great influence, who were the means of\r\nintroducing the first Tibetan sovereign into the country. At present it\r\nboasts of but little cultivation, and a scattered population,\r\ninhabiting a few hamlets, 5,500 feet above the sea: beautiful lanes and\r\npaths wind everywhere over the gentle slopes, and through the copsewood\r\nthat has replaced the timber-trees of a former period. Mendongs and\r\nchaits are very numerous, some of great size; and there are also the\r\nruins of two very large temples, near which are some magnificent\r\nweeping cypresses, eighty feet high. These fine trees are landmarks\r\nfrom all parts of the flat; they form irregular cones of pale bright\r\ngreen, with naked gnarled tops, the branches weep gracefully, but not\r\nlike the picture in Macartney’s Embassy to China, whence originated the\r\nfamous willow-pattern of our crockery. The ultimate branchlets are very\r\nslender and pendulous; my Lepcha boys used to make elegant chaplets of\r\nthem, binding the withes with scarlet worsted. The trunk is quite\r\nerect, smooth, cylindrical, and pine-like; it harbours no moss, but\r\nair-plants, Orchids, and ferns, nestle on the limbs, and pendulous\r\nlichens, like our beard-moss, wave from the branches.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I ascended to Doobdi. The path was broad, and skilfully\r\nconducted up a very steep slope covered with forest: the top, which is\r\n6,470 feet above the sea, and nearly 1000 above Yoksun, is a broad\r\npartially paved platform, on which stand two temples, surrounded by\r\nbeautiful cypresses: one of these trees (perhaps the oldest in Sikkim)\r\nmeasured sixteen and a half feet in girth, at five feet from the\r\nground, and was apparently ninety feet high: it was not pyramidal, the\r\ntop branches being dead and broken, and the lower limbs spreading; they\r\nwere loaded with masses of white-flowered Cœlogynes, and Vacciniums.\r\nThe younger trees were pyramidal.\r\n\r\nI was received by a monk of low degree, who made many apologies for the\r\nabsence of his superior, who had been ordered an eight years’ penance\r\nand seclusion from the world, of which only three had passed. On\r\ninquiry, I learnt the reason for this; the holy father having found\r\nhimself surrounded by a family, to which there would have been no\r\nobjection, had he previously obtained a dispensation. As, however, he\r\nhad omitted this preliminary, and was able to atone by prayer and\r\npayment, he had been condemned to do penance; probably at his own\r\nsuggestion, as the seclusion will give him sanctity, and eventually\r\nlead to his promotion, when his error shall have been forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Temple and weeping cypress]\r\n\r\nBoth temples are remarkable for their heavily ornamented, two-storied\r\nporticos, which occupy nearly the whole of one end. The interior\r\ndecorations are in a ruinous condition, and evidently very old; they\r\nhave no Hindoo emblems.\r\n\r\nThe head Lama sent me a present of dried peaches, with a bag of\r\nwalnuts, called “Koal-kun” by the Lepchas, and “Taga-sching” by the\r\nBhoteeas; the two terminations alike signifying “tree.”\r\n\r\nThe view of Yoksun from this height was very singular: it had the\r\nappearance of an enormous deposit banked up against a spur to the\r\nsouth, and mountains to the east, and apparently levelled by the action\r\nof water: this deposit seemed as though, having once completely filled\r\nthe valley of the Ratong, that river had cut a gorge 2000 feet deep\r\nbetween it and the opposite mountain.\r\n\r\nAlthough the elevation is so low, snow falls abundantly at Doobdi in\r\nwinter; I was assured that it has been known of the depth of five feet,\r\na statement I consider doubtful; the quantity is, however, certainly\r\ngreater than at equal heights about Dorjiling, no doubt owing to its\r\nproximity to Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nI was amused here by watching a child playing with a popgun, made of\r\nbamboo, similar to that of quill, with which most English children are\r\nfamiliar, which propels pellets by means of a spring-trigger made of\r\nthe upper part of the quill. It is easy to conclude such resemblances\r\nbetween the familiar toys of different countries to be accidental, but\r\nI question their being really so. On the plains of India, men may often\r\nbe seen for hours together, flying what with us are children’s kites;\r\nand I procured a jews’-harp from Tibet. These are not the toys of\r\nsavages, but the amusements of people more than half-civilised, and\r\nwith whom we have had indirect communication from the earliest ages.\r\nThe Lepchas play at quoits, using slate for the purpose, and at the\r\nHighland games of “putting the stone” and “drawing the stone.” Chess,\r\ndice, draughts, Punch, hockey, and battledore and shuttlecock, are all\r\nIndo-Chinese or Tartarian; and no one familiar with the wonderful\r\ninstances of similarity between the monasteries, ritual, ceremonies,\r\nattributes, vestments, and other paraphernalia of the eastern and\r\nwestern churches, can fail to acknowledge the importance of recording\r\neven the most trifling analogies or similarities between the manners\r\nand customs of the young as well as of the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nLeave Yoksun for Kinchinjunga—Ascend Ratong valley—Salt-smuggling over\r\nRatong—Landslips—Plants—Buckeem—Blocks of gneiss—Mon\r\nLepcha—View—Weather—View from Gubroo—Kinchinjunga, tops of—Pundim\r\ncliff—Nursing—Vegetation of Himalaya—Coup d’œil of Jongri—Route to\r\nYalloong—Arduous route of salt-traders from Tibet—Kinchin, ascent\r\nof—Lichens—Surfaces sculptured by snow and ice—Weather at\r\nJongri—Snow—Shades for eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Yoksun on an expedition to Kinchinjunga on the 7th of January.\r\nIt was evident that at this season I could not attain any height; but I\r\nwas most anxious to reach the lower limit of that mass of perpetual\r\nsnow which descends in one continuous sweep from 28,000 to 15,000 feet,\r\nand radiates from the summit of Kinchin, along every spur and shoulder\r\nfor ten to fifteen miles, towards each point of the compass.\r\n\r\nThe route lay for the first mile over the Yoksun flat, and then wound\r\nalong the almost precipitous east flank of the Ratong, 1000 feet above\r\nits bed, leading through thick forest. It was often difficult, crossing\r\ntorrents by calms of bamboo, and leading up precipices by notched poles\r\nand roots of trees. I wondered what could have induced the frequenting\r\nof such a route to Nepal, when there were so many better ones over\r\nSingalelah, till I found from my guide that he had habitually smuggled\r\nsalt over this pass to avoid the oppressive duty levelled by the Dewan\r\non all imports from Tibet by the eastern passes: he further told me\r\nthat it took five days to reach Yalloong in Nepal front Yoksun, on the\r\nthird of which the Kanglanamo pass is crossed, which is open from April\r\nto November, but is always heavily snowed. Owing to this duty, and the\r\nremoteness of the eastern passes, the people on the west side of the\r\nGreat Rungeet were compelled to pay an enormous sum for salt; and the\r\nLamas of Changachelling and Pemiongchi petitioned Dr. Campbell to use\r\nhis influence with the Nepal Court to have the Kanglanamo pass\r\nre-opened, and the power of trading with the Tibetans of Wallanchoon,\r\nYangma, and Kambachen, restored to them: the pass having been closed\r\nsince the Nepalese war, to prevent the Sikkim people from kidnapping\r\nchildren and slaves, as was alleged to be their custom.[108]\r\n\r\n [108] An accusation in which there was probably some truth; for the\r\n Sikkim Dingpun, who guided Dr. Campbell and myself to Mainom,\r\n Tassiding, etc., since kidnapped, or caused to be abducted, a girl of\r\n Brahmin parents, from the Mai valley of Nepal, a transaction which\r\n cost him some 300 rupees. The Nepal Durbar was naturally furious, the\r\n more so as the Dingpun had no caste, and was therefore abhorred by all\r\n Brahmins. Restitution was demanded through Dr. Campbell, who caused\r\n the incensed Dingpun to give up his paramour and her jewels. He vowed\r\n vengeance against Dr. Campbell, and found means to gratify it, as I\r\n shall hereafter show.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe passed some immense landslips, which had swept the forest into the\r\ntorrent, and exposed white banks of angular detritus of gneiss and\r\ngranite: we crossed one 200 yards long, by a narrow treacherous path,\r\non a slope of 35°: the subjacent gneiss was nearly vertical, striking\r\nnorth-east. We camped at 6,670 feet, amongst a vegetation I little\r\nexpected to find so close to the snows of Kinchin; it consisted of oak,\r\nmaple, birch, laurel, rhododendron, white _Daphne,_ jessamine, _Arum,\r\nBegonia, Cyrtandraceæ,_ pepper, fig, _Menispermum,_ wild cinnamon,\r\n_Scitamineæ,_ several epiphytic orchids, vines, and ferns in great\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, I proceeded north-west up the Ratong river, here\r\na furious torrent; which we crossed, and then ascended a very steep\r\nmountain called “Mon Lepcha.” Immense detached masses of gneiss, full\r\nof coarse garnets, lay on the slope, some of which were curiously\r\nmarked with a series of deep holes, large enough to put one’s fist in,\r\nand said to be the footprints of the sacred cow. They appeared to me to\r\nhave been caused by the roots of trees, which spread over the rocks in\r\nthese humid regions, and wear channels in the hardest material,\r\nespecially when they follow the direction of its lamination or\r\nstratification.\r\n\r\nI encamped at a place called Buckeem (alt. 8,650 ft.), in a forest of\r\n_Abies Brunoniana_ and _Webbiana,_ yew, oak, various rhododendrons, and\r\nsmall bamboo. Snow lay in patches at 8000 feet, and the night was cold\r\nand clear. On the following morning I continued the ascent, alternately\r\nup steeps and along perfectly level shelves, on which were occasionally\r\nfrozen pools, surrounded with dwarf juniper and rhododendrons. Across\r\none I observed the track of a yak in the snow; it presented two ridges,\r\nprobably from the long hair of this animal, which trails on the ground,\r\nsweeping the snow from the centre of its path. At 11,000 feet the snow\r\nlay deep and soft in the woods of silver fir, and the coolies waded\r\nthrough it with difficulty.\r\n\r\nEnormous fractured boulders of gneiss were frequent over the whole of\r\nMon Lepcha, from 7000 to 11,000 feet: they were of the same material as\r\nthe rock _in situ,_ and as unaccountable in their origin as the loose\r\nblocks on Dorjiling and Sinchul spurs at similar elevations, often\r\ncresting narrow ridges. I measured one angular detached block, forty\r\nfeet high, resting on a steep narrow shoulder of the spur, in a\r\nposition to which it was impossible it could have rolled; and it is\r\nequally difficult to suppose that glacial ice deposited it 4000 feet\r\nabove the bottom of the gorge, except we conclude the valley to have\r\nbeen filled with ice to that depth. A glance at the map will show that\r\nMon Lepcha is remarkably situated, opposite the face of Kinchinjunga,\r\nand at the great bend of the Ratong. Had that valley ever been filled\r\nwith water during a glacial period, Mon Lepcha would have formed a\r\npromontory, and many floating bergs from Kinchin would have been\r\nstranded on its flank: but I nowhere observed these rocks to be of so\r\nfine a granite as I believe the upper rocks of Kinchin to be, and I\r\nconsequently cannot advance even that far-fetched solution with much\r\nplausibility.\r\n\r\nAs I ascended, the rocks became more granitic, with large crystals of\r\nmica. The summit was another broad bare flat, elevated 13,080 feet, and\r\nfringed by a copse of rose, berberry, and very alpine rhododendrons:\r\nthe Himalayan heather (_Adromeda fastigiata_) grew abundantly here,\r\naffording us good fuel.\r\n\r\nThe toilsome ascent through the soft snow and brushwood delayed the\r\ncoolies, who scarcely accomplished five miles in the day. Some of them\r\nhaving come up by dark, I prepared to camp on the mountain-top,\r\nstrewing thick masses of _Andromeda_ and moss (which latter hung in\r\ngreat tufts from the bushes) on the snow; my blankets bad not arrived,\r\nbut there was no prospect of a snow-storm.\r\n\r\nThe sun was powerful when I reached the summit, and I was so warm that\r\nI walked about barefoot on the frozen snow without inconvenience,\r\npreferring it to continuing in wet stockings: the temperature at the\r\ntime was 29·5°, with a brisk south-east moist wind, and the dew point\r\n22·8°.\r\n\r\nThe night was magnificent, brilliant starlight, with a pale mist over\r\nthe mountains: the thermometer fell to 15·5° at 7.30 p.m., and one laid\r\nupon wood with its bulb freely exposed, sank to 7·5°: the snow sparkled\r\nwith broad flakes of hoar-frost in the full moon, which was so bright,\r\nthat I recorded my observations by its light. Owing to the extreme cold\r\nof radiation, I passed a very uncomfortable night. The minimum\r\nthermometer fell to 1° in shade.[109] The sky was clear; and every\r\nrock, leaf, twig, blade of grass, and the snow itself, were covered\r\nwith broad rhomboidal plates of hoar-frost, nearly one-third of an inch\r\nacross: while the metal scale of the thermometer instantaneously\r\nblistered my tongue. As the sun rose, the light reflected from these\r\nmyriads of facets had a splendid effect.\r\n\r\n [109] At sunrise the temperature was 11·5°; that of grass, cleared on\r\n the previous day from snow, and exposed to the sky, 6·5°; that on\r\n wool, 2·2°; and that on the surface of the snow, 0·7°.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore sunrise the atmosphere was still, and all but cloudless. To the\r\nsouth-east were visible the plains of India, at least 140 miles\r\ndistant; where, as usual, horizontal layers of leaden purple vapour\r\nobscured the horizon: behind these the sun rose majestically, instantly\r\ndispersing them, while a thin haze spread over all the intervening\r\nmountains, from its slanting beams reaching me through otherwise\r\nimperceptible vapours: these, as the sun mounted higher, again became\r\ninvisible, though still giving that transparency to the atmosphere and\r\nbrilliant definition of the distances, so characteristic of a damp, yet\r\nclear day.\r\n\r\nMon Lepcha commands a most extensive view of Sikkim, southward to\r\nDorjiling. At my feet lay the great and profound valley of the Ratong,\r\na dark gulf of vegetation. Looking northward, the eye followed that\r\nriver to the summit of Kinchinjunga (distant eighteen miles), which\r\nfronts the beholder as Mont Blanc does when seen from the mountains on\r\nthe opposite side of the valley of Chamouni. To the east are the\r\nimmense precipices and glaciers of Pundim, and on the west those of\r\nKubra, forming great supporters to the stupendous mountain between\r\nthem. Mon Lepcha itself is a spur running south-east from the Kubra\r\nshoulder: it is very open, and covered with rounded hills for several\r\nmiles further north, terminating in a conspicuous conical black\r\nhummock[110] called Gubroo, of 15,000 feet elevation, which presents a\r\nblack cliff to the south.\r\n\r\n [110] This I have beau told is the true Kubra; and the great snowy\r\n mountain behind it, which I here, in conformity with the Dorjiling\r\n nomenclature, call Kubra, has no name, being considered a part of\r\n Kinchin.\r\n\r\n\r\nKinchinjunga rises in three heads, of nearly equal height,[111] which\r\nform a line running north-west. It exposes many white or grey rocks,\r\nbare of snow, and disposed in strata[112] sloping to the west; the\r\ncolour of all which above 20,000 feet, and the rounded knobbed form of\r\nthe summit, suggest a granitic formation. Lofty snowed ridges project\r\nfrom Kubra into the Ratong valley, presenting black precipices of\r\nstratified rocks to the southward. Pundim has a very grand appearance;\r\nbeing eight miles distant, and nearly 9000 feet above Mon Lepcha, it\r\nsubtends an angle of 12°; while Kinchin top, though 15,000 feet higher\r\nthan Mon Lepcha, being eighteen miles distant, rises only 9° 30 minutes\r\nabove the true horizon: these angular heights are too small to give\r\nmuch grandeur and apparent elevation to mountains, however lofty; nor\r\nwould they do so in this case, were it not that the Ratong valley which\r\nintervenes, is seen to be several thousand feet lower, and many degrees\r\nbelow the real horizon.\r\n\r\n [111] The eastern and western tops, are respectively 27,826 and 28,177\r\n feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n [112] I am aware that the word strata is inappropriate here; the\r\n appearance of stratification or bedding, if it indicate any structure\r\n of the rock, being, I cannot doubt, due to that action which gives\r\n parallel cleavage planes to granite in many parts of the world, and to\r\n which the so-called lamination or foliation of slate and gneiss is\r\n supposed by many geologists to be due. It is not usual to find this\r\n structure so uniformly and conspicuously developed through large\r\n masses of granite, as it appeared to me to be on the sides of\r\n Kinchinjunga and on the top of Junnoo, as seen from the Choonjerma\r\n pass (p. 264, plate); but it is sometimes very conspicuous, and\r\n nowhere more than in the descent of the Grimsel towards Meyringen,\r\n where the granite on the east flank of that magnificent gorge seems\r\n cleft into parallel nearly vertical strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kinchinjunga and Pundim from Mon Lepcha]\r\n\r\nPundim has a tremendous precipice to the south, which, to judge from\r\nits bareness of snow, must be nearly perpendicular; and it presented a\r\nsuperb geological section. The height of this precipice I found by\r\nangles with a pocket sextant to be upwards of 3,400 feet, and that of\r\nits top to be 21,300 above the sea, and consequently only 715 feet less\r\nthan that of the summit of Pundim itself (which is 22,015 feet). This\r\ncliff is of black stratified rocks, sloping to the west, and probably\r\nstriking north-west; permeated from top to bottom by veins of white\r\ngranite, disposed in zigzag lines, which produce a contortion of the\r\ngneiss, and give it a marbled appearance. The same structure may be\r\nseen in miniature on the transported blocks which abound in the Sikkim\r\nrivers; where veins of finely grained granite are forced in all\r\ndirections through the gneiss, and form parallel seams or beds between\r\nthe laminæ of that rock, united by transverse seams, and crumpling up\r\nthe gneiss itself, like the crushed leaves of a book. The summit of\r\nPundim itself is all of white rock, rounded in shape, and forming a cap\r\nto the gneiss, which weathers into precipices.\r\n\r\nA succession of ridges, 14,000 to 18,000 feet high, presented a line of\r\nprecipices running south from Pundim for several miles: immense granite\r\nveins are exposed on their surfaces, and they are capped by stratified\r\nrocks, sloping to the east, and apparently striking to the north-west,\r\nwhich, being black, contrast strongly with the white granite beneath\r\nthem: these ridges, instead of being round-topped, are broken into\r\nsplintered crags, behind which rises the beautiful conical peak of\r\nNursing, 19,139 feet above the sea, eight miles distant, and subtending\r\nan angle of 8° 30′.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of these precipices was a very conspicuous series of lofty\r\nmoraines, round whose bases the Ratong wound; these appeared of much\r\nthe same height, rising several hundred feet above the valley: they\r\nwere comparatively level-topped, and had steep shelving rounded sides.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in describing the upper Ratong valley,\r\nbecause it drains the south face of the loftiest mountain on the globe;\r\nand I have introduced angular heights, and been precise in my details,\r\nbecause the vagueness with which all terms are usually applied to the\r\napparent altitude and steepness of mountains and precipices, is apt to\r\ngive false impressions. It is essential to attend to such points where\r\nscenery of real interest and importance is to be described. It is\r\ncustomary to speak of peaks as towering in the air, which yet subtend\r\nan angle of very few degrees; of almost precipitous ascents, which,\r\nwhen measured, are found to be slopes of 18° or 20°; and of cliffs as\r\nsteep and stupendous, which are inclined at a very moderate angle.\r\n\r\nThe effect of perspective is as often to deceive in details as to give\r\ntruth to general impressions; and those accessories are sometimes\r\nwanting in nature, which, when supplied by art, give truth to the\r\nlandscape. Thus, a streak of clouds adds height to a peak which should\r\nappear lofty, but which scarcely rises above the true horizon; and a\r\nbelt of mist will sunder two snowy mountains which, though at very\r\ndifferent distances, for want of a play of light and shade on their\r\ndazzling surfaces, and from the extreme transparency of the air in\r\nlofty regions, appear to be at the same distance from the observer.\r\n\r\nThe view to the southward from Mon Lepcha, including the country\r\nbetween the sea-like plains of India and the loftiest mountain on the\r\nglobe, is very grand, and neither wanting in variety nor in beauty.\r\nFrom the deep valleys choked with tropical luxuriance to the scanty yak\r\npasturage on the heights above, seems but a step at the first\r\n_coup-d’oceil,_ but resolves itself on a closer inspection into five\r\nbelts: 1, palm and plantain; 2, oak and laurel; 3, pine; 4,\r\nrhododendron and grass; and 5, rock and snow. From the bed of the\r\nRatong, in which grow palms with screw-pine and plantain, it is only\r\nseven miles in a direct line to the perpetual ice. From the plains of\r\nIndia, or outer Himalaya, one may behold snowy peaks rise in the\r\ndistance behind a foreground of tropical forest; here, on the contrary,\r\nall the intermediate phases of vegetation are seen at a glance. Except\r\nin the Himalaya this is no common phenomenon, and is owing to the very\r\nremarkable depth of the river-beds. That part of the valley of the\r\nRatong where tropical vegetation ceases, is but 4000 feet above the\r\nsea, and though fully fifty miles as the crow flies (and perhaps 200 by\r\nthe windings of the river) from the plains of India, is only eight in a\r\nstraight line (and forty by the windings) from the snows which feed\r\nthat river. In other words, the descent is so rapid, that in eight\r\nmiles the Ratong waters every variety of vegetation, from the lichen of\r\nthe poles to the palm of the tropics; whilst throughout the remainder\r\nof its mountain course, it falls from 4000 to 300 feet, flowing amongst\r\ntropical scenery, through a valley whose flanks rise from 5000 to\r\n12,000 feet above its bed.\r\n\r\nFrom Mon Lepcha we proceeded north-west towards Jongri, along a very\r\nopen rounded bare mountain, covered with enormous boulders of gneiss,\r\nof which the subjacent rock is also composed. The soil is a thick clay\r\nfull of angular stones, everywhere scooped out into little depressions\r\nwhich are the dry beds of pools, and are often strewed with a thin\r\nlayer of pebbles. Black tufts of alpine aromatic rhododendrons of two\r\nkinds (_R. anthopogon_ and _setosum_), with dwarf juniper, comprised\r\nall the conspicuous vegetation at this season.\r\n\r\nAfter a two hours’ walk, keeping at 13,000 feet elevation, we sighted\r\nJongri.[113] There were two stone huts on the bleak face of the spur,\r\nscarcely distinguishable at the distance of half a mile from the great\r\nblocks around them. To the north Gubroo rose in dismal grandeur, backed\r\nby the dazzling snows of Kubra, which now seemed quite near, its lofty\r\ntop (alt. 24,005 feet) being only eight miles distant. Much snow lay on\r\nthe ground in patches, and there were few remains of herbaceous\r\nvegetation; those I recognised were chiefly of poppy, _Potentilla,_\r\ngentian, geranium, fritillary, _Umbelliferæ,_ grass, and sedges.\r\n\r\n [113] I am assured by Capt. Sherwill, who, in 1852, proceeded along\r\n and surveyed the Nepal frontier beyond this point to Gubroo, that this\r\n is not Jongri, but Yangpoong. The difficulty of getting precise\r\n information, especially as to the names of seldom-visited spots, is\r\n very great. I was often deceived myself, undesignedly, I am sure, on\r\n the part of my informants; but in this case I have Dr. Campbell’s\r\n assurance, who has kindly investigated the subject, that there is no\r\n mistake on my part. Captain Sherwill has also kindly communicated to\r\n me a map of the head waters of the Rungbee, Yungya, and Yalloong\r\n rivers, of which, being more correct than my own, I have gladly\r\n availed myself for my map. Gubroo, he informs me, is 15,000 feet in\r\n altitude, and dips in a precipice 1000 feet high, facing Kubra, which\r\n prevented his exploring further north.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at the huts the weather was still fine, with a strong\r\nnorth-west wind, which meeting the warm moist current from the Ratong\r\nvalley, caused much precipitation of vapour. As I hoped to be able to\r\nvisit the surrounding glaciers from this spot, I made arrangements for\r\na stay of some days: giving up the only habitable hut to my people, I\r\nspread my blankets in a slope from its roof to the ground, building a\r\nlittle stone dyke round the skirts of my dwelling, and a fire-place in\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nHence to Yalloong in Nepal, by the Kanglanamo pass, is two days’ march:\r\nthe route crosses the Singalelah range at an elevation of about 15,000\r\nfeet, south of Kubra, and north of a mountain that forms a conspicuous\r\nfeature south-west from Jongri, as a crest of black fingered peaks,\r\ntipped with snow.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive the amount of labour expended upon every\r\npound of salt imported into this part of Sikkim from Tibet, and as an\r\nenumeration of the chief features of the routes it must follow, will\r\ngive some idea of what the circuit of the loftiest mountain in the\r\nglobe involves, I shall briefly allude to them; premising that the\r\ncircuit of Mont Blanc may be easily accomplished in four days. The\r\nshortest route to Yoksun (the first village south of Kinchin) from the\r\nnearest Tibetan village north of that mountain, involves a detour of\r\none-third of the circumference of Kinchin. It is evident that the most\r\ndirect way must be that nearest the mountain-top, and therefore that\r\nwhich reaches the highest accessible elevation on its shoulders, and\r\nwhich, at the same time, dips into the shallowest valleys between those\r\nshoulders. The actual distance in a straight line is about fifty miles,\r\nfrom Yoksun to the mart at or near Tashirukpa.\r\n\r\nThe marches between them are as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. To Yalloong two days; crossing Kanglanamo pass, 15,000 feet high.\r\n\r\n3. To foot of Choonjerma pass, descending to 10,000 feet.\r\n4. Cross Choonjerma pass, 15,260 feet, and proceed to Kambachen, 11,400\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n5. Cross Nango pass, 15,770, and camp on Yangma river, 11,000 feet.\r\n\r\n6. Ascend to foot of Kanglachem pass, and camp at 15,000 feet.\r\n\r\n7. Cross Kanglachem pass, probably 16,500 feet; and\r\n\r\n8–10. It is said to be three marches hence to the Tibetan custom-house,\r\nand that two more snowy passes are crossed.\r\n\r\nThis allows no day of rest, and gives only five miles—as the crow\r\nflies—to be accomplished each day, but I assume fully fourteen of road\r\ndistance; the labour spent in which would accomplish fully thirty over\r\ngood roads. Four snowed passes at least are crossed, all above 15,000\r\nfeet, and after the first day the path does not descend below 10,000\r\nfeet. By this route about one-third of the circuit of Kinchinjunga is\r\naccomplished. Supposing the circuit were to be completed by the\r\nshortest practicable route, that is, keeping as near the summit as\r\npossible, the average time required for a man with his load would be\r\nupwards of a month.\r\n\r\nTo reach Tashirukpa by the eastern route from Yoksun, being a journey\r\nof about twenty-five days, requires a long detour to the southward and\r\neastward, and afterwards the ascent of the Teesta valley, to Kongra\r\nLama, and so north to the Tibetan Arun.\r\n\r\nMy first operation after encamping and arranging my instruments, was to\r\nsink the ground thermometer; but the earth being frozen for sixteen\r\ninches, it took four men several hours’ work with hammer and chisel, to\r\npenetrate so deep. There was much vegetable matter for the first eight\r\nor ten inches, and below that a fine red clay. I spent the afternoon,\r\nwhich was fine, in botanising. When the sun shone, the smell of the two\r\nrhododendrons was oppressive, especially as a little exertion at this\r\nelevation brings on headache. There were few mosses; but crustaceous\r\nlichens were numerous, and nearly all of them of Scotch, Alpine,\r\nEuropean, and Arctic kinds. The names of these, given by the classical\r\nLinnæus and Wahlenberg, tell in some cases of their birth-places, in\r\nothers of their hardihood, their lurid colours and weather-beaten\r\naspects; such as _tristis, gelida, glacialis, arctica, alpina,\r\nsaxatilis, polaris, frigida,_ and numerous others equally familiar to\r\nthe Scotch botanist. I recognised many as natives of the wild mountains\r\nof Cape Horn, and the rocks of the stormy Antarctic ocean; since\r\nvisiting which regions I had not gathered them. The lichen called\r\n_geographicus_ was most abundant, and is found to indicate a certain\r\ndegree of cold in every latitude; descending to the level of the sea in\r\nlatitude 52° north, and 50° south, but in lower latitudes only to be\r\nseen on mountains. It flourishes at 10,000 feet on the Himalaya,\r\nascending thence to 18,000 feet. Its name, however, was not intended to\r\nindicate its wide range, but the curious maplike patterns which its\r\nyellow crust forms on the rocks.\r\n\r\nOf the blocks of gneiss scattered over the Jongri spur, many are twenty\r\nfeet in diameter. The ridge slopes gently south-west to the Choroong\r\nriver, and more steeply north-east to the Ratong, facing Kinchin: it\r\nrises so very gradually to a peaked mountain between Jongri and Kubra,\r\nthat it is not possible to account for the transport and deposit of\r\nthese boulders by glaciers of the ordinary form, viz., by a stream of\r\nice following the course of a valley; and we are forced to speculate\r\nupon the possibility of ice having capped the whole spur, and moved\r\ndownwards, transporting blocks from the prominences on various parts of\r\nthe spur.\r\n\r\nThe cutting up of the whole surface of this rounded mountain into\r\nlittle pools, now dry, of all sizes, from ten to about one hundred\r\nyards in circumference, is a very striking phenomenon. The streams flow\r\nin shallow transverse valleys, each passing through a succession of\r\nsuch pools, accompanying a step-like character of the general surface.\r\nThe beds are stony, becoming more so where they enter the pools, upon\r\nseveral of the larger of which I observed curving ridges of large\r\nstones, radiating outwards on to their beds from either margin of the\r\nentering stream: more generally large stones were deposited opposite\r\nevery embouchure.\r\n\r\nThis superficial sculpturing must have been a very recent operation;\r\nand the transport of the heavy stones opposite the entrance of the\r\nstreams has been effected by ice, and perhaps by snow; just as the\r\narctic ice strews the shores of the Polar ocean with rocks.\r\n\r\nThe weather had been threatening all day, northern and westerly\r\ncurrents contending aloft with the south-east trade-wind of Sikkim, and\r\nmeeting in strife over the great upper valley of the Ratong. Stately\r\nmasses of white cumuli wheeled round that gulf of glaciers, partially\r\ndissipating in an occasional snow-storm, but on the whole gradually\r\naccumulating.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival the thermometer was 32°, with a powerful sun shining, and\r\nit fell to 28° at 4 p.m., when the north wind set in. At sunset the\r\nmoon rose through angry masses of woolly cirrus; its broad full orb\r\nthrew a flood of yellow light over the serried tops south of Pundim;\r\nthence advancing obliquely towards Nursing, “it stood tip-toe” for a\r\nfew minutes on that beautiful pyramid of snow, whence it seemed to take\r\nflight and mount majestically into mid-air, illuminating Kinchin,\r\nPundim, and Kubra.\r\n\r\nI sat at the entrance of my gipsy-like hut, anxiously watching the\r\nweather, and absorbed in admiration of the moonrise, from which my\r\nthoughts were soon diverted by its fading light as it entered a dense\r\nmass of mare’s-tail cirrus. It was very cold, and the stillness was\r\noppressive. I had been urged not to attempt such an ascent in January,\r\nmy provisions were scanty, firewood only to be obtained from some\r\ndistance, the open undulating surface of Jongri was particularly\r\nexposed to heavy snow-drifts, and the path was, at the best, a scarcely\r\nperceptible track. I followed every change of the wind, every\r\nfluctuation of the barometer and thermometer, each accession of\r\nhumidity, and the courses of the clouds aloft. At 7 p.m., the wind\r\nsuddenly shifted to the west, and the thermometer instantly rose from\r\n20° to 30°. After 8 p.m., the temperature fell again, and the wind drew\r\nround from west by south to north-east, when the fog cleared off. The\r\nbarometer rose no more than it usually does towards 10 p.m., and though\r\nit clouded again, with the temperature at 17°, the wind seemed steady,\r\nand I went to bed with a relieved mind.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 10._—During the night the temperature fell to 11·2°, and at 6\r\na.m. was 19·8°, falling again to 17° soon after. Though clouds were\r\nrapidly coming up from the west and south-west, the wind remained\r\nnortherly till 8 a.m., when it shifted to south-west, and the\r\ntemperature rose to 25°. As it continued fine, with the barometer high,\r\nI ventured on a walk towards Gubroo, carefully taking bearings of my\r\nposition. I found a good many plants in a rocky valley close to that\r\nmountain, which I in vain attempted to ascend. The air was 30°, with a\r\nstrong and damp south-west wind, and the cold was so piercing, that two\r\nlads who were with me, although walking fast, became benumbed, and\r\ncould not return without assistance. At 11 a.m., a thick fog obliged us\r\nto retrace our steps: it was followed by snow in soft round pellets\r\nlike sago, that swept across the hard ground. During the afternoon it\r\nsnowed unceasingly, the wind repeatedly veering round the compass,\r\nalways from west to east by south, and so by north to west again. The\r\nflakes were large, soft, and moist with the south wind, and small,\r\nhard, and dry with the north. Glimpses of blue sky were constantly seen\r\nto the south, under the gloomy canopy above, but they augured no\r\nchange. As darkness came on, the temperature fell to 15°, and it snowed\r\nvery hard; at 6 p.m., it was 11°, but rose afterwards to 18°.\r\n\r\nThe night was very cold and wintry: I sat for some hours behind a\r\nblanket screen (which had to be shifted every few minutes) at my\r\ntent-door, keeping up a sulky fire, and peering through the snow for\r\nsigns of improvement, but in vain. The clouds were not dense, for the\r\nmoon’s light was distinct, shining on the glittering snow-flakes that\r\nfell relentlessly: my anxiety was great, and I could not help censuring\r\nmyself severely for exposing a party to so great danger at such a\r\nseason. I found comfort in the belief that no idle curiosity had\r\nprompted me, and that with a good motive and a strong prestige of\r\nsuccess, one can surmount a host of difficulties. Still the snow fell;\r\nand my heart sank, as my fire declined, and the flakes sputtered on the\r\nblackening embers; my little puppy, who had gambolled all day amongst\r\nthe drifting white pellets, now whined, and crouched under my thick\r\nwoollen cloak; the inconstant searching wind drifted the snow into the\r\ntent, whose roof so bagged in with the accumulation that I had to\r\nsupport it with sticks, and dreaded being smothered, if the weight\r\nshould cause it to sink upon my bed during my sleep. The increasing\r\ncold drove me, however, to my blankets, and taking the precaution of\r\nstretching a tripod stand over my head, so as to leave a breathing\r\nhole, by supporting the roof if it fell in, I slept soundly, with my\r\ndog at my feet.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise the following morning the sky was clear, with a light north\r\nwind; about two feet of snow had fallen, the drifts were deep, and all\r\ntrace of the path obliterated. The minimum thermometer had fallen to\r\n3·7°, the temperature rose to 27° at 9 a.m., after which the wind fell,\r\nand with it the thermometer to 18°. Soon, however, southerly breezes\r\nset in, bringing up heavy masses of clouds.\r\n\r\nMy light-hearted companions cheerfully prepared to leave the ground;\r\nthey took their appointed loads without a murmur, and sought protection\r\nfor their eyes from the glare of the newly fallen snow, some with as\r\nmuch of my crape veil as I could spare, others with shades of brown\r\npaper, or of hair from the yaks’ tails, whilst a few had\r\nspectacle-shades of woven hair; and the Lepchas loosened their\r\npigtails, and combed their long hair over their eyes and faces. It is\r\nfrom fresh-fallen snow alone that much inconvenience is felt; owing, I\r\nsuppose, to the light reflected from the myriads of facets which the\r\ncrystals of snow present. I have never suffered inconvenience in\r\ncrossing beds of old snow, or glaciers with weathered surfaces, which\r\nabsorb a great deal of light, and reflect comparatively little, and\r\nthat little coloured green or blue.\r\n\r\nThe descent was very laborious, especially through the several miles of\r\nbush and rock which lie below the summit: so that, although we started\r\nat 10 a.m., it was dark by the time we reached Buckeem, where we found\r\ntwo lame coolies, whom we had left on our way up, and who were keeping\r\nup a glorious fire for our reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Maitrya, the Sixth or Coming Boodh]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nRatong river below Mon Lepcha—Ferns—Vegetation of Yoksun,\r\ntropical—_Araliaceæ,_ fodder for cattle—Rice-paper plant—Geology of\r\nYoksun—Lake—Old temples—Funereal cypresses—Gigantic\r\nchait—Altars—Songboom—Weather—Catsuperri—Velocity of Ratong—Worship at\r\nCatsuperri lake—Scenery—Willow—Lamas and ecclesiastical establishments\r\nof Sikkim—Tengling—Changachelling temples and monks—Portrait of myself\r\non walls—Block of mica-schist—Lingcham Kajee asks for\r\nspectacles—Hee-hill—Arrive at Little Rungeet—At Dorjiling—Its deserted\r\nand wintry appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day we marched to Yoksun: the weather was fair, though\r\nit was evidently snowing on the mountains above. I halted at the Ratong\r\nriver, at the foot of Mon Lepcha, where I found its elevation to be\r\n7,150 feet; its edges were frozen, and the temperature of the water\r\n36°; it is here a furious torrent flowing between gneiss rocks which\r\ndip south-south-east, and is flanked by flat-topped beds of boulders,\r\ngravel and sand, twelve to fourteen feet thick. Its vegetation\r\nresembles that of Dorjiling, but is more alpine, owing no doubt to the\r\nproximity of Kinchinjunga. The magnificent _Rhododendron argenteum_ was\r\ngrowing on its banks. On the other hand, I was surprised to see a\r\nbeautiful fern (a _Trichomanes,_ very like the Irish one) which is not\r\nfound at Dorjiling. The same day, at about the same elevation, I\r\ngathered sixty species of fern, many of very tropical forms.[114] No\r\ndoubt the range of such genera is extended in proportion to the extreme\r\ndamp and equable climate, here, as about Dorjiling. Tree-ferns are\r\nhowever absent, and neither plantains, epiphytical _Orchideæ,_ nor\r\npalms, are so abundant, or ascend so high as on the outer ranges. About\r\nYoksun itself, which occupies a very warm sheltered flat, many tropical\r\ngenera occur, such as tall bamboos of two kinds, grasses allied to the\r\nsugar-cane, scarlet _Erythrina,_ and various _Araliaceæ,_ amongst which\r\nwas one species whose pith was of so curious a structure, that I had no\r\nhesitation in considering the then unknown Chinese substance called\r\nrice-paper to belong to a closely allied plant.[115]\r\n\r\n [114] They consisted of the above-mentioned _Trichomanes,_ three\r\n _Hymenophyllæ, Vittaria, Pleopeltis,_ and _Marattia,_ together with\r\n several _Selaginellas._\r\n\r\n\r\n [115] The Chinese rice-paper has long been known to be cut from\r\n cylinders of pith which has always a central hollow chamber, divided\r\n into compartments by septa or excessively thin plates. It is only\r\n within the last few months that my supposition has been confirmed, by\r\n my father’s receiving from China, after many years of correspondence,\r\n specimens of the rice-paper plant itself, which very closely resemble,\r\n in botanical characters, as well as in outward appearance of size and\r\n habit, the Sikkim plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natives collect the leaves of many Aralias as fodder for cattle,\r\nfor which purpose they are of the greatest service in a country where\r\ngrass for pasture is so scarce; this is the more remarkable, since they\r\nbelong to the natural family of ivy, which is usually poisonous; the\r\nuse of this food, however, gives a peculiar taste to the butter. In\r\nother parts of Sikkim, fig-leaves are used for the same purpose, and\r\nbranches of a bird-cherry (_Prunus_), a plant also of a very poisonous\r\nfamily, abounding in prussic acid.\r\n\r\nWe were received with great kindness by the villagers of Yoksun, who\r\nhad awaited our return with some anxiety, and on hearing of our\r\napproach had collected large supplies of food; amongst other things\r\nwere tares (called by the Lepchas “Kullai”), yams (“Book”), and a bread\r\nmade by bruising together damp maize and rice into tough thin cakes\r\n(“Ketch-ung tapha”). The Lamas of Doobdi were especially civil, having\r\na favour to ask, which was that I would intercede with Dr. Campbell to\r\nprocure the permission of the Nepalese to reopen the Kanglanamo pass,\r\nand thus give some occupation to their herds of yaks, which were now\r\nwandering idly about.\r\n\r\nI botanized for two days on the Yoksun flat, searching for evidence of\r\nlacustrine strata or moraines, being more than ever convinced by the\r\nviews I had obtained of this place from Mon Lepcha, that its uniformity\r\nof surface was due to water action. It is certainly the most level area\r\nof its size that I know of in Sikkim, though situated in one of the\r\ndeepest valleys, and surrounded on almost all sides by very steep\r\nmountains; and it is far above the flat gravel terraces of the present\r\nriver-beds. I searched the surface of the flat for gravel beds in vain,\r\nfor though it abounds in depressions that must have formerly been\r\nlake-beds, and are now marshes in the rainy season, these were all\r\nfloored with clay. Along the western edge, where the descent is very\r\nsteep for 1,800 feet to the Ratong, I found no traces of stratified\r\ndeposits, though the spurs which projected from it were often flattened\r\nat top. The only existing lake has sloping clay banks, covered with\r\nspongy vegetable mould; it has no permanent affluent or outlet, its\r\npresent drainage being subterranean, or more probably by evaporation;\r\nbut there is an old water-channel several feet above its level. It is\r\neighty to a hundred yards across, and nearly circular; its depth three\r\nor four feet, increased to fifteen or sixteen in the rains; like all\r\nsimilar pools in Sikkim, it contains little or no animal life at this\r\nseason, and I searched in vain for shells, insects, or frogs. All\r\naround were great blocks of gneiss, some fully twelve feet square.\r\n\r\nThe situation of this lake is very romantic, buried in a tall forest of\r\noaks and laurels, and fringed by wild camellia shrubs; the latter are\r\nnot the leafy, deep green, large-blossomed plants of our greenhouses,\r\nbut twiggy bushes with small scattered leaves, and little yellowish\r\nflowers like those of the tea-plant. The massive walls of a ruined\r\ntemple rise close to the water, which looks like the still moat of a\r\ncastle: beside it are some grand old funereal cypresses, with ragged\r\nscattered branches below, where they struggle for light in the dense\r\nforest, but raising their heads aloft as bright green pyramids.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Altar and song-boom at Yoksun]\r\n\r\nAfter some difficulty I found the remains of a broad path that divided\r\ninto two; one of them led to a second ruined temple, fully a mile off,\r\nand the other I followed to a grove, in which was a gigantic chait; it\r\nwas a beautiful lane throughout, bordered with bamboo, brambles,\r\ngay-flowered _Melastomaceæ_ like hedge-roses, and scarlet _Erythrina_:\r\nthere were many old mendongs and chaits on the way, which I was always\r\ncareful to leave on the right hand in passing, such being the rule\r\namong Boodhists, the same which ordains that the praying-cylinder or\r\n“Mani” be made to revolve in a direction against the sun’s motion.\r\n\r\nThis great chait is the largest in Sikkim; it is called “Nirbogong,”\r\nand appears to be fully forty feet high; facing it is a stone altar\r\nabout fifteen feet long and four broad, and behind this again is a very\r\ncurious erection called “Song-boom,” used for burning juniper as\r\nincense; it resembles a small smelting furnace, and consists of an\r\nelongated conical stone building eight feet high, raised on a single\r\nblock; it is hollow, and divided into three stories or chambers; in the\r\nlower of which is a door, by which fuel is placed inside, and the smoke\r\nascending through holes in the upper slabs, escapes by lateral openings\r\nfrom the top compartment. These structures are said to be common in\r\nTibet, but I saw no other in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Yoksun, the weather was very cold, especially at\r\nnight, considering the elevation (5,600 feet): the mean temperature was\r\n39°, the extremes being 19·2° and 60°; and even at 8 a.m. the\r\nthermometer, laid on the frosty grass, stood at 20°; temperatures which\r\nare rare at Dorjiling, 1,500 feet higher. I could not but regard with\r\nsurprise such half tropical genera as perennial-leaved vines,\r\n_Saccharum, Erythrina,_ large bamboos, _Osbeckia_ and cultivated\r\nmillet, resisting such low temperatures.[116]\r\n\r\n [116] This is no doubt due to the temperature of the soil being always\r\n high: I did not sink a thermometer at Yoksun, but from observations\r\n taken at similar elevations, the temperature of the earth, at three\r\n feet depth, may be assumed to be 55°.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 14th January I left Yoksun for the lake and temples of\r\nCatsuperri, the former of which is by much the largest in Sikkim. After\r\na steep descent of 1800 feet, we reached the Ratong, where its bed is\r\nonly 3,790 feet above the sea; it is here a turbulent stream, twelve\r\nyards across, with the usual features of gravel terraces, huge boulders\r\nof gneiss and some of the same rock _in situ,_ striking north-east.\r\nSome idea of its velocity may be formed from the descent it makes from\r\nthe foot of Mon Lepcha, where the elevation of its bed was 7,150 feet,\r\ngiving a fall of 3,350 feet in only ten miles.\r\n\r\nHence I ascended a very steep spur, through tropical vegetation, now\r\nbecome so familiar to me that I used to count the number of species\r\nbelonging to the different large natural orders, as I went along. I\r\ngathered only thirty-five ferns at these low elevations, in the same\r\nspace as produces from fifty to sixty in the more equable and humid\r\nregions of 6000 feet; grasses on the other hand were much more\r\nnumerous. The view of the flat of Yoksun from Lungschung village,\r\nopposite to it, and on about the same level, is curious; as is that of\r\nthe hamlet of Lathiang on the same side, which I have before noticed as\r\nbeing placed on a very singular flat shelf above the Ratong, and is\r\noverhung by rocks.\r\n\r\nAscending very steeply for several thousand feet, we reached a hollow\r\non the Catsuperri spur, beyond which the lake lies buried in a deep\r\nforest. A Lama from the adjacent temple accompanied us, and I found my\r\npeople affecting great solemnity as they approached its sacred bounds;\r\nthey incessantly muttered “Om mani,” etc., kotowed to trees and stones,\r\nand hung bits of rag on the bushes. A pretence of opposing our progress\r\nwas made by the priest, who of course wanted money; this I did not\r\nappear to notice, and after a steep descent, we were soon on the shores\r\nof what is, for Sikkim, a grand sheet of water, (6,040 feet above the\r\nsea), without any apparent outlet: it may be from three to five hundred\r\nyards across in the rains, but was much less now, and was bordered by a\r\nbroad marsh of bog moss (_Sphagnum_), in which were abundance of\r\n_Azolla,_ colouring the waters red, and sedges. Along the banks were\r\nbushes of _Rhododendron barbatum_ and _Berberis insignis,_[117] but the\r\nmass of the vegetation was similar to that of Dorjiling.\r\n\r\n [117] This magnificent new species has not been introduced into\r\n England; it forms a large bush, with deep-green leaves seven inches\r\n long, and bunches of yellow flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe crossed the marsh to the edge of the lake by a rude paved way of\r\ndecaying logs, through which we often plunged up to our knees. The Lama\r\nhad come provided with a piece of bark, shaped like a boat, some\r\njuniper incense and a match-box, with which he made a fire, and put it\r\nin the boat, which he then launched on the lake as a votive offering to\r\nthe presiding deity. It was a dead calm, but the impetus he gave to the\r\nbark shot it far across the lake, whose surface was soon covered with a\r\nthick cloud of white smoke. Taking a rupee from me, the priest then\r\nwaved his arm aloft, and pretended to throw the money into the water,\r\nsinging snatches of prayers in Tibetan, and at times shrieking at the\r\ntop of his voice to the Dryad who claims these woods and waters as his\r\nown. There was neither bird, beast, nor insect to be seen, and the\r\nscenery was as impressive to me, as the effect of the simple service\r\nwas upon my people, who prayed with redoubled fervour, and hung more\r\nrags on the bushes.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that this invocation of the gods of the woods and\r\nwaters forms no part of Lama worship; but the Lepchas are but half\r\nBoodhists; in their hearts they dread the demons of the grove, the\r\nlake, the snowy mountain and the torrent, and the crafty Lama takes\r\nadvantage of this, modifies his practices to suit their requirements,\r\nand is content with the formal recognition of the spiritual supremacy\r\nof the church. This is most remarkably shown in their acknowledgment of\r\nthe day on which offerings had been made from time immemorial by the\r\npagan Lepchas to the genius of Kinchinjunga, by holding it as a\r\nfestival of the church throughout Sikkim.[118]\r\n\r\nThe two Catsuperri temples occupy a spur 445 feet above the lake, and\r\n6,485 feet above the sea; they are poor, and only remarkable for a\r\nmiserable weeping-willow tree planted near them, said to have been\r\nbrought from Lhassa. The monks were very civil to me, and offered\r\namongst other things a present of excellent honey. One was an\r\nintelligent man, and gave me much information: he told me that there\r\nwere upwards of twenty religious establishments in Sikkim, containing\r\nmore than 1000 priests. These have various claims upon the devout:\r\nthus, Tassiding, Doobdi, Changachelling, and Pemiongchi, are celebrated\r\nfor their antiquity, and the latter also for being the residence of the\r\nhead Lama; Catsuperri for its lake; Raklang for its size, etc. All are\r\nunder one spiritual head, who is the Tupgain Lama, or eldest son of the\r\nRajah; and who resides at the Phadong convent, near Tumloong: the Lama\r\nof Pemiongchi is, however, the most highly respected, on account of his\r\nage, position, and sanctity. Advancement in the hierarchy is dependent\r\nchiefly on interest, but indirectly on works also; pilgrimages to\r\nLhassa and Teshoo Loombo are the highest of these, and it is clearly\r\nthe interest of the supreme pontiffs of those ecclesiastical capitals\r\nto encourage such, and to intimate to the Sikkim authorities, the\r\nclaims those who perform them have for preferment. Dispensations for\r\npetty offences are granted to Lamas of low degree and monks, by those\r\nof higher station, but crimes against the church are invariably\r\nreferred to Tibet, and decided there.\r\n\r\n [118] On that occasion an invocation to the mountain is chanted by\r\n priests and people in chorus. Like the Lama’s address to the genius of\r\n Catsuperri lake, its meaning, if it ever had any, is not now apparent.\r\n It runs thus:—\r\n            “Kanchin-jinga, Pemi Kadup\r\n             Gnetche Tangla, Dursha tember\r\n             Zu jinga Pemsum Serkiem\r\n             Dischze Kubra Kanchin tong.”\r\nThis was written for me by Dr. Campbell, who, like myself, has vainly\r\nsought its solution; it is probably a mixture of Tibetan and Lepcha,\r\nboth as much corrupted as the celebrated “Om mani padmi boom,” which is\r\nuniversally pronounced by Lepchas “Menny pemmy boom.” This reminds me\r\nthat I never got a solution of this sentence from a Lama, of whatever\r\nrank or learning; and it was only after incessant inquiry, during a\r\nresidence of many years in Nepal, that Mr. Hodgson at last procured the\r\ninterpretation, or rather paraphrase: “Hail to him (Sakya) of the lotus\r\nand the jewel,” which is very much the same as M. Klaproth and other\r\nauthorities have given.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election to the Sikkim Lamaseries is generally conducted on the\r\nprinciple of self-government, but Pemiongchi and some others are often\r\nserved by Lamas appointed from Tibet, or ordained there, at some of the\r\ngreat convents. I never heard of an instance of any Sikkim Lama\r\narriving at such sanctity as to be considered immortal, and to reappear\r\nafter death in another individual, nor is there any election of\r\ninfants. All are of the Ningma, Dookpa, or Shammar sect, and are\r\ndistinguished by their red mitres; they were once dominant throughout\r\nTibet, but after many wars[119] with the yellow-caps, they were driven\r\nfrom that country, and took refuge principally in the Himalaya. The\r\nBhotan or Dhurma[120] Rajah became the spiritual head of this sect,\r\nand, as is well known, disputes the temporal government also of his\r\ncountry with the Deva Rajah, who is the hereditary temporal monarch,\r\nand never claims spiritual jurisdiction. I am indebted to Dr. Campbell\r\nfor a copy and translation of the Dhurma Rajah’s great seal, containing\r\nthe attributes of his spirituality, a copy of which I have appended to\r\nthe end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n [119] The following account of the early war between the red and the\r\n yellow-mitred Lamas was given me by Tchebu Lama:—For twenty-five\r\n generations the red-cape (Dookpa or Ningma) prevailed in Tibet, when\r\n they split into two sects, who contended for supreme power; the Lama\r\n of Phado, who headed the dissenters, and adopted a yellow mitre, being\r\n favoured by the Emperor of China, to whom reference was made. A\r\n persecution of the red Lamas followed, who were caught by the\r\n yellow-caps, and their mitres plunged into dyeing vats kept always\r\n ready at the Lamaseries. The Dookpa, however, still held Teshoo\r\n Loombo, and applied to the Sokpo (North Tibet) Lamas for aid, who\r\n bringing horses and camels, easily prevailed over the Gelookpa or\r\n yellow sect, but afterwards treacherously went over to them, and\r\n joined them in an attack on Teshoo Loombo, which was plundered and\r\n occupied by the Gelookpas. The Dookpa thereafter took refuge in Sikkim\r\n and Bhotan, wbence the Bhotan Rajah became their spiritual chief under\r\n the name of Dhurma Rajah, and is now the representative of that creed.\r\n Goorucknath is still the Dookpa’s favourite spiritual deity of the\r\n older creed, which is, however, no longer in the ascendant. The Dalai\r\n Lama of Teshoo Loombo is a Gelookpa, as is the Rimbochay Lama, and the\r\n Potala Lama of Lhassa, according to Tchebu Lama, but Turner (“Travels\r\n in Tibet,” p. 315) says the contrary; the Gelookpa consider Sakya\r\n Thoba (or Tsongkaba) alias Mahamouni, as their great avatar.\r\n\r\n\r\n [120] Bhotan is generally known as the Dhurma country. See note, page\r\n 136.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe internal organisation of the different monastic establishments is\r\nvery simple. The head or Teshoo Lama[121] rules supreme; then come the\r\nmonks and various orders of priests, and then those who are candidates\r\nfor orders, and dependents, both lay-brothers and slaves: there are a\r\nfew nunneries in Sikkim, and the nuns are all relatives or connections\r\nof the Rajah, his sister is amongst them. During the greater part of\r\nthe year, all lead a more or less idle life; the dependents being the\r\nmost occupied in carrying wood and water, cultivating the land, etc.\r\n\r\n [121] I have been informed by letters from Dr. Campbell that the\r\n Pemiongchi Lama is about to remove the religious capital of Sikkim to\r\n Dorjiling, and build there a grand temple and monastery; this will be\r\n attractive to visitors, and afford the means of extending our\r\n knowledge of East Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lay-brothers are often skilful workmen, and are sometimes lent or\r\nhired out as labourers, especially as housebuilders and decorators. No\r\ntax of any kind is levied on the church, which is frequently very rich\r\nin land, flocks, and herds, and in contributions from the people: land\r\nis sometimes granted by the Rajah, but is oftener purchased by the\r\npriests, or willed, or given by the proprietor. The services, to which\r\nI have already alluded, are very irregularly performed; in most temples\r\nonly on festival days, which correspond to the Tibetan ones so\r\nadmirably described in MM. Huc and Gabet’s narrative; in a few,\r\nhowever, service is performed daily, especially in such as stand near\r\nfrequented roads, and hence reap the richest harvest.\r\n\r\nLike all the natives of Tibet and Sikkim, the priests are intolerably\r\nfilthy; in some cases so far carrying out their doctrines as not even\r\nto kill the vermin with which they swarm. All are nominally bound to\r\nchastity, but exemptions in favour of Lamas of wealth, rank, or power,\r\nare granted by the supreme pontiffs, both in Tibet and Sikkim. I\r\nconstantly found swarms of children about the Lamaseries, who were\r\ninvariably called nephews and nieces.\r\n\r\nDescending from the Catsuperri temples, I encamped at the village of\r\nTengling (elevation 5,257 feet), where I was waited upon by a bevy of\r\nforty women, Lepchas and Sikkim Bhoteeas, accompanied by their\r\nchildren, and bringing presents of fowls, rice and vegetables, and\r\napologising for the absence of their male relatives, who were gone to\r\ncarry tribute to the Rajah. Thence I marched to Changachelling, first\r\ndescending to the Tengling river, which divides the Catsuperri from the\r\nMolli ridge, and which I crossed.\r\n\r\nTree-ferns here advance further north than in any other part of Sikkim.\r\nI did not visit the Molli temples, but crossed the spur of that name,\r\nto the Rungbee river, whose bed is 3,300 feet above the sea; thence I\r\nascended upwards of 3,500 feet to the Changachelling temples, passing\r\nTchongpong village. The ridge on which both Pemiongchi and\r\nChangachelling are built, is excessively narrow at top; it is traversed\r\nby a “via Sacra,” connecting these two establishments; this is a pretty\r\nwooded walk, passing mendongs and chaits hoary with lichens and mosses;\r\nto the north the snows of Kinchinjunga are seen glimmering between the\r\ntrunks of oaks, laurels, and rhododendrons, while to the south the\r\nSinchul and Dorjiling spurs shut out the view of the plains of India.\r\n\r\nChangachelling temples and chaits crown a beautiful rocky eminence on\r\nthe ridge, their roofs, cones and spires peeping through groves of\r\nbamboo, rhododendrons, and arbutus; the ascent is by broad flights of\r\nsteps cut in the mica-slate rocks, up which shaven and girdled monks,\r\nwith rosaries and long red gowns, were dragging loads of bamboo stems,\r\nthat produced a curious rattling noise. At the summit there is a fine\r\ntemple, with the ruins of several others, and of many houses: the\r\ngreater part of the principal temple, which is two-storied and divided\r\ninto several compartments, is occupied by families. The monks were busy\r\nrepairing the part devoted to worship, which consists of a large\r\nchamber and vestibule of the usual form: the outside walls are daubed\r\nred, with a pigment of burnt felspathic clay, which is dug hard by.\r\nSome were painting the vestibule with colours brought from Lhassa,\r\nwhere they had been trained to the art. Amongst other figures was one\r\nplaying on a guitar, a very common symbol in the vestibules of Sikkim\r\ntemples: I also saw an angel playing on the flute, and a snake-king\r\noffering fruit to a figure in the water, who was grasping a serpent.\r\nAmongst the figures I was struck by that of an Englishman, whom, to my\r\namusement, and the limner’s great delight, I recognised as myself. I\r\nwas depicted in a flowered silk coat instead of a tartan shooting\r\njacket, my shoes were turned up at the toes, and I had on spectacles\r\nand a tartar cap, and was writing notes in a book. On one side a\r\nsnake-king was politely handing me fruit, and on the other a horrible\r\ndemon was writhing.\r\n\r\nA crowd had collected to see whether I should recognise myself, and\r\nwhen I did so, the merriment was extreme. They begged me to send them a\r\nsupply of vermilion, goldleaf, and brushes; our so called camel’s-hair\r\npencils being much superior to theirs, which are made of marmot’s hair.\r\n\r\nI was then conducted to a house, where I found salted and buttered tea\r\nand Murwa beer smoking in hospitable preparation. As usual, the house\r\nwas of wood, and the inhabited apartments above the low basement story\r\nwere approached by an outside ladder, like a Swiss cottage: within were\r\ntwo rooms floored with earth; the inner was small, and opened on a\r\nverandah that faced Kinchinjunga, whence the keen wind whistled through\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nThe head Lama, my jolly fat friend of the 20th of December, came to\r\nbreakfast with me, followed by several children, nephews and nieces he\r\nsaid; but they were uncommonly like him for such a distant\r\nrelationship, and he seemed extremely fond of them, and much pleased\r\nwhen I stuffed them with sugar.\r\n\r\nChangachelling hill is remarkable for having on its summit an immense\r\ntabular mass of chlorite slate, resting apparently horizontally on\r\nvariously inclined rocks of the same: it is quite flat-topped, ten to\r\ntwelve yards each way, and the sides are squared by art; the country\r\npeople attribute its presence here to a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe view of the Kinchin range from this spot being one of the finest in\r\nSikkim, and the place itself being visible from Dorjiling, I took a\r\nvery careful series of bearings, which, with those obtained at\r\nPemiongchi, were of the utmost use in improving my map, which was\r\ngradually progressing. To my disappointment I found that neither priest\r\nnor people knew the name of a single snowy mountain. I also asked in\r\nvain for some interpretation of the lines I have quoted at page 365;\r\nthey said they were Lepcha worship, and that they only used them for\r\nthe gratification of the people, on the day of the great festival of\r\nKinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nHence I descended to the Kulhait river, on my route back to Dorjiling,\r\nvisiting my very hospitable tippling friend, the Kajee of Lingcham, on\r\nthe way down: he humbly begged me to get him a pair of spectacles, for\r\nno other object than to look wise, as he had the eyes of a hawk; he\r\ntold me that mine drew down universal respect in Sikkim, and that I had\r\nbeen drawn with them on, in the temple at Changachelling; and that a\r\npair would not only wonderfully become him, but afford him the most\r\npleasing recollections of myself. Happily I had the means of gratifying\r\nhim, and have since been told that he wears them on state occasions.\r\n\r\nI encamped by the river, 3,160 feet above the sea, amongst figs and\r\nplantains, on a broad terrace of pebbles, boulders and sand, ten feet\r\nabove the stream; the rocks in the latter were covered with a red\r\nconferva. The sand on the banks was disposed in layers, alternately\r\nwhite and red, the white being quartz, and the red pulverised garnets.\r\nThe arranging of these sand-bands by the water must be due to the\r\ndifferent specific gravities of the garnet and quartz; the former being\r\nlighter, is lifted by the current on to the surface of the quartz, and\r\nleft there when the waters retire.\r\n\r\nOn the next day I ascended Hee hill, crossed it at an elevation of\r\n7,290 feet, and camped on the opposite side at 6,680 feet, in a dense\r\nforest. The next march was still southward to the little Rungeet\r\nguard-house, below Dorjiling spur, which I reached after a fatiguing\r\nwalk amidst torrents of rain. The banks of the little Rungeet river,\r\nwhich is only 1,670 feet above the sea, are very flat and low, with\r\nbroad terraces of pebbles and shingle, upon which are huge gneiss\r\nboulders, fully 200 feet above the stream.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, I ascended the Tukvor spur to Dorjiling, and\r\nreceived a most hospitable welcome from my friend Mr. Muller, now\r\nalmost the only European inhabitant of the place; Mr. Hodgson having\r\ngone down on a shooting excursion in the Terai, and Dr. Campbell being\r\non duty on the Bhotan frontier. The place looked what it really\r\nwas—wholly deserted. The rain I had experienced in the valley, had here\r\nbeen snow, and the appearance of the broad snowed patches clear of\r\ntrees, and of the many houses without smoke or inhabitant, and the tall\r\nscattered trees with black bark and all but naked branches, was dismal\r\nin the extreme. The effect was heightened by an occasional Hindoo, who\r\nflitted here and there along the road, crouching and shivering, with\r\nwhite cotton garments and bare legs.\r\n\r\nThe delight of my Lepcha attendants at finding themselves safely at\r\nhome again, knew no bounds; and their parents waited on me with\r\npresents, and other tokens of their goodwill and gratitude. I had no\r\nlack of volunteers for a similar excursion in the following season,\r\nthough with their usual fickleness, more than half failed me, long\r\nbefore the time arrived for putting their zeal to the proof.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Dr. Campbell for the accompanying impression and\r\ndescription of the seal of the Dhurma Rajah, or sovereign pontiff of\r\nBhotan, and spiritual head of the whole sect of the Dookpa, or\r\nred-mitred Lama Boodhists. The translations were made by Aden Tchehu\r\nLama, who accompanied us into Sikkim in 1849, and I believe they are\r\nquite correct. The Tibetan characters run from left to right.\r\n    The seal of the Dhurma Rajah is divided into a centre portion and\r\n    sixteen rays. In the centre is the word Dookyin, which means “The\r\n    Dookpa Creed”; around the “Dookyin” are sixteen similar letters,\r\n    meaning “I,” or “I am.” The sixteen radial compartments contain his\r\n    titles and attributes, thus, commencing from the centre erect one,\r\n    and passing round from left to right:—\r\n\r\n1. I am the Spiritual and Temporal Chief of the Realm.\r\n2. The Defender of the Faith.\r\n3. Equal to Saruswati in learning.\r\n4. Chief of all the Boodhs.\r\n5. Head expounder of the Shasters.\r\n6.

The weather was raw, cold, and threatening: snow\r\nlay here and there at 7000 feet, and all vegetation was very backward,\r\nand wore a wintry garb. The laurels, maples, and deciduous-leaved oaks,\r\nhydrangea and cherry, were leafless, but the abundance of chesnuts and\r\nevergreen oaks, rhododendrons, _Aucuba, Linonia,_ and other shrubs,\r\nkept the forest well clothed. The oaks had borne a very unusual number\r\nof acorns during the last season, which were now falling, and strewing\r\nthe road in some places so abundantly, that it was hardly safe to ride\r\ndown hill.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Bengal were all but obscured by a dense haze, partly\r\nowing to a peculiar state of the atmosphere that prevails in the dry\r\nmonths, and partly to the fires raging in the Terai forest, from which\r\nwhite wreaths of smoke ascended, stretching obliquely for miles to the\r\neastward, and filling the air with black particles of grass-stems,\r\ncarried 4000 feet aloft by the heated ascending currents that impinge\r\nagainst the flanks of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the tropical region the air was scented with the white blossoms of\r\nthe _Vitex Agnus-castus,_ which grew in profusion by the road-side; but\r\nthe forest, which had looked so gigantic on my arrival at the mountains\r\nthe previous year, appeared small after the far more lofty and bulky\r\noaks and pines of the upper regions of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nThe evening was sultry and close, the heated surface of the earth\r\nseemed to load the surrounding atmosphere with warm vapours, and the\r\nsensation, as compared with the cool pure air of Dorjiling, was that of\r\nentering a confined tropical harbour after a long sea-voyage.\r\n\r\nI slept in the little bungalow of Punkabaree, and was wakened next\r\nmorning by sounds to which I had long been a stranger, the voices of\r\ninnumerable birds, and the humming of great bees that bore large holes\r\nfor their dwellings in the beams and rafters of houses: never before\r\nhad I been so forcibly struck with the absence of animal life in the\r\nregions of the upper Himalaya.\r\n\r\nBreakfasting early, I pursued my way in the so-called cool of the\r\nmorning, but this was neither bright nor fresh; the night having been\r\nhazy, there had been no terrestrial radiation, and the earth was dusty\r\nand parched; while the sun rose through a murky yellowish atmosphere\r\nwith ill-defined orb. Thick clouds of smoke pressed upon the plains,\r\nand the faint easterly wind wafted large flakes of grass charcoal\r\nsluggishly through the air.\r\n\r\nVegetation was in great beauty, though past its winter prime. The\r\ntropical forest of India has two flowering seasons; one in summer, of\r\nthe majority of plants; and the other in winter, of _Acanthaceæ,\r\nBauhinia, Dillenia, Bombax,_ etc. Of these the former are abundant, and\r\nrender the jungle gay with large and delicate white, red, and purple\r\nblossoms. Coarse, ill-favoured vultures wheeled through the air,\r\nlanguid Bengalees had replaced the active mountaineers, jackal-like\r\ncurs of low degree teemed at every village, and ran howling away from\r\nthe onslaught of my mountain dog; and the tropics, with all their\r\nbeauty of flower and genial warmth, looked as forbidding and\r\nunwholesome as they felt oppressive to a frame that had so long\r\nbreathed the fresh mountain air.\r\n\r\nMounted on a stout pony, I enjoyed my scamper of sixteen miles over the\r\nwooded plains and undulating gravelly slopes of the Terai, intervening\r\nbetween the foot of the mountains and Siligoree bungalow, where I\r\nrested for an hour. In the afternoon I rode on leisurely to Titalya,\r\nsixteen miles further, along the banks of the Mahanuddy, the atmosphere\r\nbeing so densely hazy, that objects a few miles off were invisible, and\r\nthe sun quite concealed, though its light was so powerful that no part\r\nof the sky could be steadily gazed upon. This state of the air is very\r\ncurious, and has met with various attempts at explanation,[122] all\r\nunsatisfactory to me: it accompanies great heat, dryness, and\r\nelasticity of the suspended vapours, and is not affected by wind.\r\nDuring the afternoon the latter blew with violence, but being hot and\r\ndry, brought no relief to my still unacclimated frame. My pony alone\r\nenjoyed the freedom of the boundless plains, and the gallop or trot\r\nbeing fatiguing in the heat, I tried in vain to keep him at a walk; his\r\nspirits did not last long, however, for he flagged after a few days’\r\ntropical heat. My little dog had run thirty miles the day before,\r\nexclusive of all the detours he had made for his own enjoyment, and he\r\nflagged so much after twenty more this day, that I had to take him on\r\nmy saddle-bow, where, after licking his hot swollen feet, he fell fast\r\nasleep, in spite of the motion.\r\n\r\n [122] Dr. M‘Lelland (“Calcutta Journal of Natural History,” vol. i, p.\r\n 52), attributes the haze of the atmosphere during the north-west winds\r\n of this season, wholly to suspended earthy particles. But the haze is\r\n present even in the calmest weather, and extreme dryness is in all\r\n parts of the world usually accompanied by an obscure horizon. Captain\r\n Campbell (“Calcutta Journal of Natural History,” vol. ii, p. 44.) also\r\n objects to Dr. M‘Clelland’s theory, citing those parts of Southern\r\n India which are least likely to be visited by dust-storms, as\r\n possessing an equally hazy atmosphere; and further denies its being\r\n influenced by the hygrometric state of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the wooded Terai at Siligoree, trees became scarce, and\r\nclumps of bamboos were the prevalent features; these, with an\r\noccasional banyan, peepul, or betel-nut palm near the villages, were\r\nthe only breaks on the distant horizon. A powerfully scented\r\n_Clerodendron,_ and an _0sbeckia_ gay with blossoms like dog-roses,\r\nwere abundant; the former especially under trees, where the seeds are\r\ndropped by birds.\r\n\r\nAt Titalya bungalow, I received a hearty welcome from Mr. Hodgson, and\r\ncongratulations on the success of my Nepal journey, which afforded a\r\ntheme for many conversations.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had three sharp jerking shocks of an earthquake in\r\nquick succession, at 9.8 p.m., appearing to come up from the southward:\r\nthey were accompanied by a hollow rumbling sound like that of a waggon\r\npassing over a wooden bridge. The shock was felt strongly at Dorjiling,\r\nand registered by Mr. Muller at 9.10 p.m.: we had accurately adjusted\r\nour watches (chronometers) the previous morning, and the motion may\r\ntherefore fairly be assumed to have been transmitted northwards through\r\nthe intervening distance of forty miles, in two minutes. Both Mr.\r\nMuller and Mr. Hodgson had noted a much more severe shock at 6.10 p.m.\r\nthe previous evening, which I, who was walking down the mountain, did\r\nnot experience; this caused a good deal of damage at Dorjiling, in\r\ncracking well-built walls. Earthquakes are frequent all along the\r\nHimalaya, and are felt far in Tibet; they are, however, most common\r\ntowards the eastern and western extremities of India; owing in the\r\nformer case to the proximity of the volcanic forces in the bay of\r\nBengal. Cutch and Scinde, as is well known, have suffered severely on\r\nmany occasions, and in several of them the motion has been propagated\r\nthrough Affghanistan and Little Tibet, to the heart of Central\r\nAsia.[123]\r\n\r\n [123] See “Wood’s Travels to the Oxus.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 1st of March, Dr. Campbell arrived at the\r\nbungalow, from his tour of inspection along the frontier of Bhotan and\r\nthe Rungpore district; and we accompanied him hence along the British\r\nand Sikkim frontier, as far west as the Mechi river, which bounds Nepal\r\non the east.\r\n\r\nTerai is a name loosely applied to a tract of country at the very foot\r\nof the Himalaya: it is Persian, and signifies damp. Politically, the\r\nTerai generally belongs to the hill-states beyond it; geographically,\r\nit should appertain to the plains of India; and geologically, it is a\r\nsort of neutral country, being composed neither of the alluvium of the\r\nplains, nor of the rocks of the hills, but for the most part of\r\nalternating beds of sand, gravel, and boulders brought from the\r\nmountains. Botanically it is readily defined as the region of\r\nforest-trees; amongst which the Sal, the most valuable of Indian\r\ntimber, is conspicuous in most parts, though not now in Sikkim, where\r\nit has been destroyed. The Terai soil is generally light, dry, and\r\ngravelly (such as the Sal always prefers), and varies in breadth, from\r\nten miles, along the Sikkim frontier, to thirty and more on the\r\nNepalese. In the latter country it is called the Morung, and supplies\r\nSal and Sissoo timber for the Calcutta market, the logs being floated\r\ndown the Konki and Cosi rivers to the Ganges. The gravel-beds extend\r\nuninterruptedly upon the plains for fully twenty miles south of the\r\nSikkim mountains, the gravel becoming smaller as the distance\r\nincreases, and large blocks of stone not being found beyond a few miles\r\nfrom the rocks of the Himalaya itself, even in the beds of rivers,\r\nhowever large and rapid. Throughout its breadth this formation is\r\nconspicuously cut into flat-topped terraces, flanking the spurs of the\r\nmountains, at elevations varying from 250 to nearly 1000 feet above the\r\nsea. These terraces are of various breadth and length, the smallest\r\nlying uppermost, and the broadest flanking the rivers below. The\r\nisolated hills beyond are also flat-topped and terraced. This deposit\r\ncontains no fossils; and its general appearance and mineral\r\nconstituents are the only evidence of its origin, which is no doubt due\r\nto a retiring ocean that washed the base of the Sikkim Himalaya,\r\nreceived the contents of its rivers, and, wearing away its bluff spurs,\r\nspread a talus upwards of 1000 feet thick along its shores. It is not\r\nat first sight evident whether the terracing is due to periodic\r\nretirements of the ocean, or to the levelling effects of rivers that\r\nhave cut channels through the deposit. In many places, especially along\r\nthe banks of the great streams, the gravel is smaller, obscurely\r\ninterstratified with sand, and the flattened pebbles over-lap rudely,\r\nin a manner characteristic of the effects of running water; but such is\r\nnot the case with the main body of the deposit, which is unstratified,\r\nand much coarser.\r\n\r\nThe alluvium of the Gangetic valley is both interstratified with the\r\ngravel, and passes into it, and was no doubt deposited in deep water,\r\nwhilst the coarser matter[124] was accumulating at the foot of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n [124] This, too, is non-fossiliferous, and is of unknown depth, except\r\n at Calcutta, where the sand and clay beds have been bored through, to\r\n the depth of 120 feet, below which the first pebbles were met with.\r\n Whence these pebbles were derived is a curious problem. The great\r\n Himalayan rivers convey pebbles but a very few miles from the\r\n mountains on to the plains of India; and there is no rock _in situ_\r\n above the surface, within many miles of Calcutta, in any direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis view is self-evident, and has occurred, I believe, to almost every\r\nobserver, at whatever part of the base of the Himalaya he may have\r\nstudied this deposit. Its position, above the sandstones of the Sewalik\r\nrange in the north-west Himalaya, and those of Sikkim, which appear to\r\nbe modern fossiliferous rocks, indicates its being geologically of\r\nrecent formation; but it still remains a subject of the utmost\r\nimportance to discover the extent and nature of the ocean to whose\r\nagency it is referred. I have elsewhere remarked that the alluvium of\r\nthe Gangetic valley may to a great degree be the measure of the\r\ndenudation which the Himalaya has suffered along its Indian watershed.\r\nIt was, no doubt, during the gradual rise of that chain from the ocean,\r\nthat the gravel and alluvium were deposited; and in the terraces and\r\nalternation of these, there is evidence that there have been many\r\nsubsidences and elevations of the coast-line, during which the gravel\r\nhas suffered greatly from denudation.\r\n\r\nI have never looked at the Sikkim Himalaya from the plains without\r\ncomparing its bold spurs enclosing sinuous river gorges, to the\r\nweather-beaten front of a mountainous coast; and in following any of\r\nits great rivers, the scenery of its deep valleys no less strikingly\r\nresembles that of such narrow arms of the sea (or fiords) as\r\ncharacterize every mountainous coast, of whatever geological formation:\r\nsuch as the west coast of Scotland and Norway, of South Chili and\r\nFuegia, of New Zealand and Tasmania. There are too in these Himalayan\r\nvalleys, at all elevations below 600 feet, terraced pebble-beds, rising\r\nin some cases eighty feet above the rivers, which I believe could only\r\nhave been deposited by them when they debouched into deep water; and\r\nboth these, and the beds of the rivers, are strewed, down to 1000 feet,\r\nwith masses of rock. Such accumulations and transported blocks are seen\r\non the raised beaches of our narrow Scottish salt water lochs, exposed\r\nby the rising of the land, and they are yet forming of immense\r\nthickness on many coasts by the joint action of tides and streams.\r\n\r\nI have described meeting with ancient moraines in every Himalayan\r\nvalley I ascended, at or about 7000 or 8000 feet elevation, proving,\r\nthat at one period, the glaciers descended fully so much below the\r\nposition they now occupy: this can only be explained by a change of\r\nclimate,[125] or by a depression of the mountain mass equal to 8000\r\nfeet, since the formation of these moraines.\r\n\r\n [125] Such a change of temperature, without any depression or\r\n elevation of the mountains, has been thought by Capt. R. Strachey\r\n (“Journal of Geological Society”), an able Himalayan observer, to be\r\n the necessary consequence of an ocean at the foot of these mountains;\r\n for the amount of perpetual snow, and consequent descent of the\r\n glaciers, increasing indirectly in proportion to the humidity of the\r\n climate, and the snow-fall, he conjectured that the proximity of the\r\n ocean would prodigiously increase such a deposition of snow.—To me,\r\n this argument appears inconclusive; for the first effect of such a\r\n vast body of water would be to raise the temperature of winter; and as\r\n it is the rain, rather than the sun of summer, which removes the\r\n Sikkim snow, so would an increase of this rain elevate, rather than\r\n depress, the level of perpetual snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country about Titalya looks desert, from that want of trees and\r\ncultivation, so characteristic of the upper level throughout this part\r\nof the plains, which is covered with short, poor pasture-grass. The\r\nbungalow stands close to the Mahanuddy, on a low hill, cut into an\r\nescarpment twenty feet high, which exposes a section of river-laid sand\r\nand gravel, alternating with thick beds of rounded pebbles.\r\n\r\nShortly after Dr. Campbell’s arrival, the meadows about the bungalow\r\npresented a singular appearance, being dotted over with elephants,\r\nbrought for purchase by Government. It was curious to watch the arrival\r\nof these enormous animals, which were visible nearly two miles across\r\nthe flat plains; nor less interesting was it to observe the wonderful\r\ndocility of these giants of the animal kingdom, often only guided by\r\nnaked boys, perched on their necks, scolding, swearing, and enforcing\r\ntheir orders with the iron goad. There appeared as many tricks in\r\nelephant-dealers as in horse-jockeys, and of many animals brought, but\r\nfew were purchased. Government limits the price to about 75 pounds, and\r\nthe height to the shoulder must not be under seven feet, which,\r\nincredible as it appears, may be estimated within a fraction as being\r\nthree times the circumference of the forefoot. The pedigree is closely\r\ninquired into, the hoofs are examined for cracks, the teeth for age,\r\nand many other points attended to.\r\n\r\nThe Sikkim frontier, from the Mahanuddy westward to the Mechi, is\r\nmarked out by a row of tall posts. The country is undulating; and\r\nthough fully 400 miles from the ocean, and not sixty from the top of\r\nthe loftiest mountain on the globe, its average level is not 300 feet\r\nabove that of the sea. The upper levels are gravelly, and loosely\r\ncovered with scattered thorny jujube bushes, occasionally tenanted by\r\nthe _Florican,_ which scours these downs like a bustard. Sometimes a\r\nsolitary fig, or a thorny acacia, breaks the horizon, and there are a\r\nfew gnarled trees of the scarlet _Butea frondosa._\r\n\r\nOn our route I had a good opportunity of examining the line of junction\r\nbetween the alluvial plains that stretch south to the Ganges, and the\r\ngravel deposit flanking the hills. The rivers always cut broad channels\r\nwith scarped terraced sides, and their low banks are very fertile, from\r\nthe mud annually spread by the ever-shifting streams that meander\r\nwithin their limits; there are, however, few shrubs and no trees. The\r\nhouses, which are very few and scattered, are built on the gravelly\r\nsoil above, the lower level being very malarious.\r\n\r\nThirty miles south of the mountains, numerous isolated flat-topped\r\nhills, formed of stratified gravel and sand with large water-worn\r\npebbles, rise from 80 to 200 feet above the mean level, which is about\r\n250 feet above the sea; these, too, have always scarped sides, and the\r\nchannels of small streams completely encircle them.\r\n\r\nAt this season few insects but grasshoppers are to be seen, even\r\nmosquitos being rare. Birds, however, abound, and we noticed the common\r\nsparrow, hoopoe, water-wagtail, skylark, osprey, and several egrets.\r\n\r\nWe arrived on the third day at the Mechi river, to the west of which\r\nthe Nepal Terai (or Morung) begins, whose belt of Sal forest loomed on\r\nthe horizon, so raised by refraction as to be visible as a dark line,\r\nfrom the distance of many miles. It is, however, very poor, all the\r\nlarge trees having been removed. We rode for several miles into it, and\r\nfound the soil dry and hard, but supporting a prodigious undergrowth of\r\ngigantic harsh grasses that reached to our heads, though we were\r\nmounted on elephants. Besides Sal there was abundance of _Butea,\r\nDiospyros, Terminalia,_ and _Symplocos,_ with the dwarf _Phœnix_ palm,\r\nand occasionally _Cycas._ Tigers, wild elephants, and the rhinoceros,\r\nare said to be found here; but we saw none.\r\n\r\nThe old and new Mechi rivers are several miles apart, but flow in the\r\nsame depression, a low swamp many miles broad, which is grazed at this\r\nseason, and cultivated during the rains. The grass is very rich, partly\r\nowing to the moisture of the climate, and partly to the retiring waters\r\nof the rivers; both circumstances being the effects of proximity to the\r\nHimalaya. Hence cattle (buffalos and the common humped cow of India)\r\nare driven from the banks of the Ganges 300 miles to these feeding\r\ngrounds, for the use of which a trifling tax is levied on each animal.\r\nThe cattle are very carelessly herded, and many are carried off by\r\ntigers.\r\n\r\nHaving returned to Titalya, Mr. Hodgson and I set off in an eastern\r\ndirection for the Teesta river, whose embouchure from the mountains to\r\nthe plains I was anxious to visit. Though the weather is hot, and\r\noppressively so in the middle of the day, there are few climates more\r\ndelicious than that of these grassy savannahs from December to March.\r\nWe always started soon after daybreak on ponies, and enjoyed a twelve\r\nto sixteen miles’ gallop in the cool of the morning before breakfast,\r\nwhich we found prepared on our arrival at a tent sent on ahead the\r\nnight before. The road led across an open country, or followed paths\r\nthrough interminable rice-fields, now dry and dusty. On poor soil a\r\nwhite-flowered _Leucas_ monopolized the space, like our charlock and\r\npoppy: it was apparently a pest to the agriculturist, covering the\r\nsurface in some places like a sprinkling of snow. Sometimes the\r\nriver-beds exposed fourteen feet of pure stratified sand, with only an\r\ninch of vegetable soil above. At this season the mornings are very\r\nhazy, with the thermometer at sunrise 60°; one laid on grass during the\r\nnight falling 7° below that temperature: dew forms, but never\r\ncopiously: by 10 a.m. the temperature has risen to 75°, and the faint\r\neasterly morning breezes die away; the haze thickens, and covers the\r\nsky with a white veil, the thermometer rising to 82° at noon, and the\r\nwest wind succeeding in parching tornados and furious gusts, increasing\r\nwith the temperature, which attains its maximum in the afternoon, and\r\nfalling again with its decline at sunset. The evenings are calm; but\r\nthe earth is so heated, that the thermometer stands at 10 p.m. at 66°,\r\nand the minimum at night is not below 55°: great drought accompanies\r\nthe heat at this season, but not to such a degree as in North-west\r\nIndia, or other parts of this meridian further removed from the hills.\r\nIn the month of March, and during the prevalence of west winds, the\r\nmean temperature was 79°, and the dew-point 22° lower, indicating great\r\ndrought. The temperature at Calcutta was 7° warmer, and the atmosphere\r\nvery much damper.\r\n\r\nOn the second day we arrived at Jeelpigoree, a large straggling village\r\nnear the banks of the Teesta, a good way south of the forest: here we\r\nwere detained for several days, waiting for elephants with which to\r\nproceed northwards. The natives are Cooches, a Mogul (Mongolian) race,\r\nwho inhabit the open country of this district, replacing the Mechis of\r\nthe Terai forest. They are a fine athletic people, not very dark, and\r\nformed the once-powerful house of Cooch Behar. Latterly the upper\r\nclasses have adopted the religion of the Brahmins, and have had caste\r\nconferred upon them; while the lower orders have turned Mahomedans:\r\nthese, chiefly agriculturists, are a timid, oppressed class, who\r\neverywhere fled before us, and were with difficulty prevailed upon even\r\nto direct us along our road. A rude police is established by the\r\nBritish Government all over the country, and to it the traveller\r\napplies for guides and assistance; but the Conches were so shy and\r\ndifficult to deal with, that we were generally left to our own\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nGrass is the prevailing feature of the country, as there are few\r\nshrubs, and still fewer trees. Goats and the common Indian cow are\r\nplentiful; but it is not swampy enough for the buffalo; and sheep are\r\nscarce, on account of the heat of the climate. This uniformity of\r\nfeature over so immense an area is, however, due to the agency of man,\r\nand is of recent introduction; as all concur in affirming, that within\r\nthe last hundred years the face of the country was covered with the\r\nsame long jungle-grasses which abound in the Terai forest; and the\r\ntroops cantoned at Titalya (a central position in these plains) from\r\n1816 to 1828, confirm this statement as far as their immediate\r\nneighbourhood is concerned.\r\n\r\nThese gigantic _Gramineæ_ seem to be destroyed by fire with remarkable\r\nfacility at one season of the year; and it is well that this is the\r\ncase; for, whether as a retainer of miasma, a shelter for wild beasts,\r\nboth carnivorous and herbivorous, alike dangerous to man, or from their\r\nliability to ignite, and spread destruction far and wide, the\r\ngrass-jungles are most serious obstacles to civilization. Next to the\r\nrapidity with which it can be cleared, the adaptation of a great part\r\nof the soil to irrigation during the rains, has greatly aided the\r\nbringing of it under cultivation.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater proportion of this universal short turf grass is\r\nformed of _Andropogon acicularis, Cynodon Dactylon,_[126] and in sandy\r\nplaces, _Imperata cylindrica_; where the soil is wetter, _Ameletia\r\nIndica_ is abundant, giving a heather-like colour to the turf, with its\r\npale purple flowers: wherever there is standing water, its surface is\r\nreddened by the _Azolla,_ and _Salvinia_ is also common.\r\n\r\n [126] Called “Dhob.” This is the best pasture grass in the plains of\r\n India, and the only one to be found over many thousands of square\r\n miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Jeelpigoree we were waited upon by the Dewan, who governs the\r\ndistrict for the Rajah, a boy about ten years old, whose estates are\r\nlocked up during the trial of an interminable suit for the succession,\r\nthat has been instituted against him by a natural son of the late\r\nRajah: we found the Dewan to be a man of intelligence, who promised us\r\nelephants as soon as the great Hooli festival, now commenced, should be\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe large village, at the time of our visit, was gay with holiday\r\ndresses. It is surrounded by trees, chiefly of banyan, jack, mango,\r\npeepul, and tamarind: interminable rice-fields extend on all sides, and\r\nexcept bananas, slender betel-nut palms, and sometimes pawn, or\r\nbetel-pepper, there is little other extensive cultivation. The\r\nrose-apple, orange, and pine-apple are rare, as are cocoa-nuts: there\r\nare few date or fan-palms, and only occasionally poor crops of\r\ncastor-oil and sugar-cane. In the gardens I noticed jasmine, _Justicia\r\nAdhatoda, Hibiscus,_ and others of the very commonest Indian ornamental\r\nplants; while for food were cultivated _Chenopodium,_ yams, sweet\r\npotatos, and more rarely peas, beans, and gourds. Bamboos were planted\r\nround the little properties and smaller clusters of houses, in oblong\r\nsquares, the ridge on which the plants grew being usually bounded by a\r\nshallow ditch. The species selected was not the most graceful of its\r\nfamily; the stems, or culms, being densely crowded, erect, as thick at\r\nthe base as the arm, copiously branching, and very feathery throughout\r\ntheir whole length of sixty feet.\r\n\r\nA gay-flowered _0sbeckia_ was common along the roadsides, and, with a\r\n_Clerodendron,_[127] whose strong, sweet odour was borne far through\r\nthe air, formed a low undershrub beneath every tree, generally\r\nintermixed with three ferns (a _Polypodium, Pteris,_ and\r\n_Goniopteris_).\r\n\r\n [127] _Clerodendron_ leaves, bruised, are used to kill vermin,\r\n fly-blows, etc., in cattle; and the twigs form toothpicks. The flowers\r\n are presented to Mahadeo, as a god of peace; milk, honey, flowers,\r\n fruit, amrit (ambrosia), etc., being offered to the pacific gods, as\r\n Vishnu, Krishna, etc.; while Mudar (_Asclepias_), Bhang (_Cannabis\r\n sativa_), _Datura,_ flesh, blood, and spirituous liquors, are offered\r\n to Siva, Doorga, Kali, and other demoniacal deities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cottages are remarkable, and have a very neat appearance,\r\npresenting nothing but a low white-washed platform of clay, and an\r\nenormous high, narrow, black, neatly thatched roof, so arched along the\r\nridge, that its eaves nearly touch the ground at each gable; and\r\nlooking at a distance like a gigantic round-backed elephant. The walls\r\nare of neatly-platted bamboo: each window (of which there are two) is\r\ncrossed by slips of bamboo, and wants only glass to make it look\r\nEuropean; they have besides shutters of wattle, that open upwards,\r\nprojecting during the day like the port-hatches of a ship, and let down\r\nat night. Within, the rooms are airy and clean: one end contains the\r\nmachans (bedsteads), the others some raised clay benches, the fire,\r\nfrequently an enormous Hookah, round wattled stools, and various\r\nimplements. The inhabitants appeared more than ordinarily well-dressed;\r\nthe men in loose flowing robes of fine cotton or muslin, the women in\r\nthe usual garb of a simple thick cotton cloth, drawn tight immediately\r\nabove the breast, and thence falling perpendicularly to the knee; the\r\ncolour of this is a bright blue in stripes, bordered above and below\r\nwith red.\r\n\r\nI anticipated some novelty from a visit to a Durbar (court) so distant\r\nfrom European influence as that of the Rajah of Jeelpigoree. All\r\nEastern courts, subject to the Company, are, however, now shorn of much\r\nof their glory; and the condition of the upper classes is greatly\r\nchanged. Under the Mogul rule, the country was farmed out to Zemindars,\r\nsome of whom assumed the title of Rajah: they collected the revenue for\r\nthe Sovereign, retaining by law ten per cent. on all that was realized:\r\nthere was no intermediate class, the peasant paying directly to the\r\nZemindar, and he into the royal treasury. Latterly the Zemindars have\r\nbecome farmers under the Company’s rule; and in the adjudication of\r\ntheir claims, Lord Cornwallis (then Governor-General) made great\r\nsacrifices in their favour, levying only a small tribute in proportion\r\nto their often great revenues, in the hope that they would be induced\r\nto devote their energies, and some of their means, to the improvement\r\nof the condition of the peasantry. This expectation was not realized:\r\nthe younger Zemindars especially, subject to no restraint (except from\r\naggressions on their neighbours), fell into slothful habits, and the\r\ncollecting of the revenue became a trading speculation, entrusted to\r\n“middle men.” The Zemindar selects a number, who again are at liberty\r\nto collect through the medium of several sub-renting classes. Hence the\r\npeasant suffers, and except a generally futile appeal to the Rajah, he\r\nhas no redress. The law secures him tenure as long as he can pay his\r\nrent, and to do this he has recourse to the usurer; borrowing in spring\r\n(at 50, and oftener 100 per cent.) the seed, plough, and bullocks: he\r\nreaps in autumn, and what is then not required for his own use, is sold\r\nto pay off part of his original debt, the rest standing over till the\r\nnext season; and thus it continues to accumulate, till, overwhelmed\r\nwith difficulties, he is ejected, or flees to a neighbouring district.\r\nThe Zemindar enjoys the same right of tenure as the peasant: the amount\r\nof impost laid on his property was fixed for perpetuity; whatever his\r\nrevenue be, he must pay so much to the Company, or he forfeits his\r\nestates, and they are put up for auction.\r\n\r\nOne evening we visited the young Rajah at his residence, which has\r\nrather a good appearance at a distance, its white walls gleaming\r\nthrough a dark tope of mango, betel, and cocoa-nut. A short rude avenue\r\nleads to the entrance gate, under the trees of which a large bazaar was\r\nbeing held; stocked with cloths, simple utensils, ornaments,\r\nsweetmeats, five species of fish from the Teesta, and the betel-nut.\r\n\r\nWe entered through a guard-house, where were some of the Rajah’s Sepoys\r\nin the European costume, and a few of the Company’s troops, lent to the\r\nRajah as a security against some of the turbulent pretenders to his\r\ntitle. Within was a large court-yard, flanked by a range of buildings,\r\nsome of good stone-work, some of wattle, in all stages of disrepair. A\r\ngreat crowd of people occupied one end of the court, and at the other\r\nwe were received by the Dewan, and seated on chairs under a canopy\r\nsupported by slender silvered columns. Some slovenly Natch-girls were\r\ndancing before us, kicking up clouds of dust, and singing or rather\r\nbawling through their noses, the usual indelicate hymns in honour of\r\nthe Hooli festival; there were also fiddlers, cutting uncouth capers in\r\nrhythm with the dancers. Anything more deplorable than the music,\r\ndancing, and accompaniments, cannot well be imagined; yet the people\r\nseemed vastly pleased, and extolled the performers.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the Rajah and his brothers was announced by a crash of\r\ntom-toms and trumpets, while over their heads were carried great gilt\r\ncanopies. With them came a troop of relations, of all ages; and amongst\r\nthem a poor little black girl, dressed in honour of us in an\r\nold-fashioned English chintz frock and muslin cap, in which she cut the\r\ndrollest figure imaginable; she was carried about for our admiration,\r\nlike a huge Dutch doll, crying lustily all the time.\r\n\r\nThe festivities of the evening commenced by handing round trays full of\r\npith-balls, the size of a nutmeg, filled with a mixture of flour, sand,\r\nand red lac-powder; with these each pelted his neighbour, the thin\r\ncovering bursting as it struck any object, and powdering it copiously\r\nwith red dust. A more childish and disagreeable sport cannot well be\r\nconceived; and when the balls were expended, the dust itself was\r\nresorted to, not only fresh, but that which had already been used was\r\ngathered up, with whatever dirt it might have become mixed. One rude\r\nfellow, with his hand full, sought to entrap his victims into talking,\r\nwhen he would stuff the nasty mixture into their mouths.\r\n\r\nAt the end attar of roses was brought, into which little pieces of\r\ncotton, fixed on slips of bamboo, were dipped, and given to each\r\nperson. The heat, dust, stench of the unwashed multitude, noise, and\r\nincreasing familiarity of the lower orders, warned us to retire, and we\r\neffected our retreat with precipitancy.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah and his brother were very fine boys, lively, frank,\r\nunaffected, and well disposed: they have evidently a good guide in the\r\nold Dewan; but it is melancholy to think how surely, should they grow\r\nup in possession of their present rank, they will lapse into slothful\r\nhabits, and take their place amongst the imbeciles who now represent\r\nthe once powerful Rajahs of Bengal.\r\n\r\nWe rode back to our tents by a bright moonlight, very dusty and tired,\r\nand heartily glad to breathe the cool fresh air, after the stifling\r\nordeal we had undergone.\r\n\r\nOn the following evening the elephants were again in waiting to conduct\r\nus to the Rajah. He and his relations were assembled outside the gates,\r\nmounted upon elephants, amid a vast concourse of people. The children\r\nand Dewan were seated in a sort of cradle; the rest were some in\r\nhowdahs, and some astride on elephants’ backs, six or eight together.\r\nAll the idols were paraded before them, and powdered with red dust; the\r\npeople howling, shouting, and sometimes quarrelling. Our elephants took\r\ntheir places amongst those of the Rajah; and when the mob had\r\nsufficiently pelted one another with balls and dirty red powder, a\r\ntorchlight procession was formed, the idols leading the way, to a very\r\nlarge tank, bounded by a high rampart, within which was a broad\r\nesplanade round the water.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the whole was very striking, the glittering cars and\r\nbarbaric gaud of the idols showing best by torchlight; while the white\r\nrobes and turbans of the undulating sea of people, and the great black\r\nelephants picking their way with matchless care and consideration,\r\ncontrasted strongly with the quiet moonbeams sleeping on the still\r\nbroad waters of the tank.\r\n\r\nThence the procession moved to a field, where the idols were placed on\r\nthe ground, and all dismounted: the Dewan then took the children by the\r\nhand, and each worshipped his tutelary deity in a short prayer dictated\r\nby the attendant Brahmin, and threw a handful of red dust in its face.\r\nAfter another ordeal of powder, singing, dancing, and suffocation, our\r\nshare in the Hooli ended; and having been promised elephants for the\r\nfollowing morning, we bade a cordial farewell to our engaging little\r\nhosts and their staid old governor.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of March we were awakened at an early hour by a heavy\r\nthunder-storm from the south-west. The sunrise was very fine, through\r\nan arch 10° high of bright blue sky, above which the whole firmament\r\nwas mottled with cirrus. It continued cloudy, with light winds,\r\nthroughout the day, but clear on the horizon. From this tinge such\r\nstorms became frequent, ushering in the equinox; and the less hazy sky\r\nand rising hygrometer predicted an accession of moisture in the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe left for Rangamally, a village eight miles distant in a northerly\r\ndirection, our course lying along the west bank of the Teesta.\r\n\r\nThe river is here navigated by canoes, thirty to forty feet long, some\r\nbeing rudely cut out of a solid log of Sal, while others are built, the\r\nplanks, of which there are but few, being sewed together, or clamped\r\nwith iron, and the seams caulked with the fibres of the root of Dhak\r\n(_Butea frondosa_), and afterwards smeared with the gluten of\r\n_Diospyros embryopteris._ The bed of the river is here threequarters of\r\na mile across, of which the stream does not occupy one-third; its banks\r\nare sand-cliffs, fourteen feet in height. A few small fish and\r\nwater-snakes swarm in the pools.\r\n\r\nThe whole country improved in fertility as we advanced towards the\r\nmountains: the grass became greener, and more trees, shrubs, herbs, and\r\nbirds appeared. In front, the dark boundary-line of the Sal forest\r\nloomed on the horizon, and to the east rose the low hills of Bhotan,\r\nboth backed by the outer ranges of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nFlocks of cranes were abundant over-head, flying in wedges, or breaking\r\nup into “open order,” preparing for their migration northwards, which\r\ntakes place in April, their return occurring in October; a small quail\r\nwas also common on the ground. Tamarisk (“Jhow”) grew in the sandy bed\r\nof the river; its flexible young branches are used in various parts of\r\nIndia for wattling and basket-making.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we walked to the skirts of the Sal forest. The great\r\ntrunks of the trees were often scored by tigers’ claws, this animal\r\nindulging in the cat-like propensity of rising and stretching itself\r\nagainst such objects. Two species of _Dillenia_ were common in the\r\nforest, with long grass, _Symplocos, Emblica,_ and _Cassia Fistula,_\r\nnow covered with long pods. Several parasitical air-plants grew on the\r\ndry trees, as _Oberonia, Vanda,_ and _Ærides._\r\n\r\nAt Rangamally, the height of the sandy banks of the Teesta varies from\r\nfifteen to twenty feet. The bed is a mile across, and all sand;[128]\r\nthe current much divided, and opaque green, from the glacial origin of\r\nmost of its head-streams. The west bank was covered with a small Sal\r\nforest, mixed with _Acacia Catechu,_ and brushwood, growing in a poor\r\nvegetable loam, over very dry sand.\r\n\r\n [128] Now covered with _Anthistiria_ grass, fifteen feet high, a\r\n little _Sissoo,_ and _Bombax._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opposite (or Bhotan) bank is much lower, and always flooded during\r\nthe rains, which is not the case on the western side, where the water\r\nrises to ten feet below the top of the bank, or from seven to ten feet\r\nabove its height in the dry season, and it then fills its whole bed.\r\nThis information we had from a police Jemadar, who has resided many\r\nyears on this unhealthy spot, and annually suffers from fever. The Sal\r\nforest has been encroached upon from the south, for many miles, within\r\nthe memory of man, by clearing in patches, and by indiscriminate\r\nfelling.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles north of Rangamally, we came to an extensive flat,\r\noccupying a recess in the high west bank, the site of the old capital\r\n(Bai-kant-pore) of the Jeelpigoree Rajah. Hemmed in as it is on three\r\nsides by a dense forest, and on all by many miles of malarious Terai,\r\nit appears sufficiently secure from ordinary enemies, during a great\r\npart of the year. The soil is sandy, overlying gravel, and covered with\r\na thick stratum of fine mud or silt, which is only deposited on these\r\nlow flats; on it grew many naturalized plants, as hemp, tobacco, jack,\r\nmango, plantain, and orange.\r\n\r\nAbout eight miles on, we left the river-bed, and struck westerly\r\nthrough a dense forest, to a swampy clearance occupied by the village\r\nof Rummai, which appeared thoroughly malarious; and we pitched the tent\r\non a narrow, low ridge, above the level of the plain.\r\n\r\nIt was now cool and pleasant, partly due, no doubt, to a difference in\r\nthe vegetation, and the proximity of swamp and forest, and partly also\r\nto a change in the weather, which was cloudy and threatening; much\r\nrain, too, had fallen here on the preceding day.\r\n\r\nBrahmins and priests of all kinds are few in this miserable country:\r\nnear the villages, and under the large trees, are, every here and\r\nthere, a few immature thatched cottages, four to six feet high, in\r\nwhich the tutelary deities of the place are kept; they are idols of the\r\nvery rudest description, of Vishnu as an ascetic (Bai-kant Nath), a\r\nwooden doll, gilt and painted, standing, with the hands raised as if in\r\nexhortation, and one leg crossed over the other. Again, Kartik, the god\r\nof war, is represented sitting astride on a peacock, with the right\r\nhand elevated and holding a small flat cup.\r\n\r\nSome fine muscular Cooches were here brought for Mr. Hodgson’s\r\nexamination, but we found them unable or unwilling to converse, in the\r\nCooch tongue, which appears to be fast giving place to Bengalee.\r\n\r\nWe walked to a stream, which flows at the base of the retiring\r\nsand-cliffs, and nourishes a dense and richly-varied jungle, producing\r\nmany plants, as beautiful _Acanthaceæ,_ Indian horse-chesnut, loaded\r\nwith white racemes of flowers, gay _Convolvuli,_ laurels, terrestrial\r\nand parasitic _Orchideæ, Dillenia,_ casting its enormous flowers as big\r\nas two fists, pepper, figs, and, in strange association with these, a\r\nhawthorn, and the yellow-flowered Indian strawberry, which ascends\r\n7,500 feet on the mountains, and _Hodgsonia,_ a new _Cucurbitaceous_\r\ngenus, clinging in profusion to the trees, and also found 5000 feet\r\nhigh on the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we rode into the forest (which was dry and very\r\nunproductive), and thence along the river-banks, through _Acacia\r\nCatechu,_ belted by _Sissoo,_ which often fringes the stream, always\r\noccupying the lowest flats. The foliage at this season is brilliantly\r\ngreen; and as the evening advanced, a yellow convolvulus burst into\r\nflower like magic, adorning the bushes over which it climbed.\r\n\r\nIt rained on the following morning; after which we left for the exit of\r\nthe Teesta, proceeding northwards, sometimes through a dense forest of\r\nSal timber, sometimes dipping into marshy depressions, or riding\r\nthrough grassy savannahs, breast-high. The coolness of the atmosphere\r\nwas delicious, and the beauty of the jungle seemed to increase the\r\nfurther we penetrated these primæval forests.\r\n\r\nEight miles from Rummai we came on a small river from the mountains,\r\nwith a Cooch village close by, inhabited during the dry season by\r\ntimber-cutters from Jeelpigoree it is situated upon a very rich black\r\nsoil, covered with _Saccharum_ and various gigantic grasses, but no\r\nbamboo. These long grasses replace the Sal, of which we did not see one\r\ngood tree.\r\n\r\nWe here mounted the elephants, and proceeded several miles through the\r\nprairie, till we again struck upon the high Sal forest-bank, continuous\r\nwith that of Rummai and Rangamally, but much loftier: it formed one of\r\nmany terraces which stretch along the foot of the hills, from\r\nPunkabaree to the Teesta, but of which none are said to occur for eight\r\nmiles eastwards along the Bhotan Dooars: if true, this is probably due\r\nin part to the alteration of the course of the Teesta, which is\r\ngradually working to the westward, and cutting away these lofty banks.\r\n\r\nThe elephant-drivers appeared to have taken us by mistake to the exit\r\nof the Chawa, a small stream which joins the Teesta further to the\r\neastward. The descent to the bed of this rivulet, round the first spur\r\nof rock we met with, was fully eighty feet, through a very irregular\r\ndepression, probably the old bed of the stream; it runs southwards from\r\nthe hills, and was covered from top to bottom with slate-pebbles. We\r\nfollowed the river to its junction with the Teesta, along a flat, broad\r\ngulley, bounded by densely-wooded, steep banks of clay slate on the\r\nnorth, and the lofty bank on the south: between these the bed was\r\nstrewed with great boulders of gneiss and other rocks, luxuriantly\r\nclothed with long grass, and trees of wild plantain, _Erythrina_ and\r\n_Bauhinia,_ the latter gorgeously in flower.\r\n\r\nThe Sal bank formed a very fine object: it was quite perpendicular, and\r\nbeautifully stratified with various coloured sands and gravel: it\r\ntailed off abruptly at the junction of the rivers, and then trended\r\naway south-west, forming the west bank of the Teesta. The latter river\r\nis at its outlet a broad and rapid, but hardly impetuous stream, now\r\nfifty yards across, gushing from between two low, forest-clad spurs: it\r\nappeared about five feet deep, and was beautifully fringed on both\r\nsides with green _Sisso._\r\n\r\nSome canoes were here waiting for us, formed of hollowed trunks of\r\ntrees, thirty feet long: two were lashed together with bamboos, and the\r\nboatmen sat one at the head and one at the stern of each: we lay along\r\nthe bottom of the vessels, and in a second we were darting down the\r\nriver, at the rate of at least ten or fifteen miles an hour, the bright\r\nwaters leaping up on all sides, and bounding in _jets-d’eau_ between\r\nprows and sterns of the coupled vessels. Sometimes we glided along\r\nwithout perceptible motion, and at others jolted down bubbling rapids,\r\nthe steersmen straining every nerve to keep their bark’s head to the\r\ncurrent, as she impatiently swerved from side to side in the eddies. To\r\nour jaded and parched frames, after the hot forenoon’s ride on the\r\nelephants, the effect was delicious: the fresh breeze blew on our\r\nheated foreheads and down our open throats and chests; we dipped our\r\nhands into the clear, cool stream, and there was “music in the waters”\r\nto our ears. Fresh verdure on the banks, clear pebbles, soft sand, long\r\nEnglish river-reaches, forest glades, and deep jungles, followed in\r\nrapid succession; and as often as we rounded a bend or shot a rapid,\r\nthe scene changed from bright to brighter still; so continuing until\r\ndusk, when we were slowly paddling along the then torpid current\r\nopposite Rangamally.[129]\r\n\r\n [129] The following temperatures of the waters of the Teesta were\r\n taken at intervals during our passage from its exit to Rangamally, a\r\n distance of fifteen linear miles, and thirty miles following the\r\n bends:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExit\r\nWater\r\nAir\r\n\r\n2.30 p.m.\r\n62°\r\n\r\n3.00 p.m.\r\n62·2°\r\n74°\r\n\r\n3.30 p.m.\r\n63·2°\r\n\r\n4.00 p.m.\r\n64°\r\n\r\n4.30 p.m.\r\n65°\r\n\r\n5.00 p.m.\r\n65·4°\r\n72·5° opposite Rummai\r\n\r\n5.30 p.m.\r\n66°\r\n\r\n6.00 p.m.\r\n66°\r\n71·7° opposite Baikant\r\n\r\nThe absence of large stones or boulders of rock in the bed of the\r\nTeesta is very remarkable, considering the great volume and rapidity of\r\nthe current, and that it shoots directly from the rocky hills to the\r\ngravelly plains. At the _embouchure_ there are boulders as big as the\r\nhead, and in the stream, four miles below the exit, the boatmen pointed\r\nout a stone as large as the body as quite a marvel.\r\n\r\nThey assured us that the average rise at the mouth of the river, in the\r\nrains, was not more than five feet: the mean breadth of the stream is\r\nfrom seventy to ninety yards. From the point where it leaves the\r\nmountains, to its junction with the Megna, is at this season thirteen\r\ndays’ voyage, the return occupying from twenty to twenty-five days,\r\nwith the boats unladen. The name “Teesta” signifies “quiet,” this river\r\nbeing so in comparison with other Himalayan torrents further west, the\r\nCosi, Konki, etc., which are devastators of all that bounds their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nWe passed but two crossing-places: at one the river is divided by an\r\nisland, covered with the rude chaits and flags of the Boodhists. We\r\nalso saw some Cooch fishermen, who throw the net much as we do: a fine\r\n“Mahaser” (a very large carp) was the best fish they had. Of\r\ncultivation there was very little, and the only habitations were a few\r\ngrass-huts of the boatmen or buffalo herdsmen, a rare Cooch village of\r\nCatechu and Sal cutters, or the shelter of timber-floaters, who seem to\r\npass the night in nests of long dry grass.\r\n\r\nOur servants not having returned with the elephants from Rummai, we\r\nspent the following day at Rangamally shooting and botanizing. I\r\ncollected about 100 species in a couple of hours, and observed perhaps\r\ntwice that number: the more common I have repeatedly alluded to, and\r\nexcepting some small terrestrial _Orchids,_ I added nothing of\r\nparticular interest to my collection.[130]\r\n\r\n [130] The following is a list of the principal genera, most of which\r\n are English:—_Polygonum, Quercus, Sonchus, Gnaphalium, Cratagus,\r\n Lobelia, Lactuca, Hydrocotyle, Saponaria, Campanula, Bidens, Rubus,\r\n Oxalis, Artemisia, Fragaria, Clematis, Dioscorea, Potamogeton, Chara,\r\n Veronica, Viola, Smilax._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of March we proceeded west to Siligoree, along the skirts\r\nof the ragged Sal forest. Birds are certainly the most conspicuous\r\nbranch of the natural history of this country, and we saw many species,\r\ninteresting either from their habits, beauty, or extensive\r\ndistribution. We noticed no less than sixteen kinds of swimming birds,\r\nseveral of which are migratory and English. The Shoveller, white-eyed\r\nand common wild ducks; Merganser, Brahminee, and Indian goose (_Anser\r\nIndica_); common and Gargany teal; two kinds of gull; one of Shearwater\r\n(_Rhynchops ablacus_); three of tern, and one of cormorant. Besides\r\nthese there were three egrets, the large crane, stork, green heron, and\r\nthe demoiselle; the English sand-martin, kingfisher, peregrine-falcon,\r\nsparrow-hawk, kestrel, and the European vulture: the wild peacock, and\r\njungle-fowl. There were at least 100 peculiarly Indian birds in\r\naddition, of which the more remarkable were several kinds of mina, of\r\nstarling, vulture, kingfisher, magpie, quail, and lapwing.\r\n\r\nThe country gradually became quite beautiful, much undulated and\r\ndiversified by bright green meadows, sloping lawns, and deeply wooded\r\nnullahs, which lead from the Sal forest and meander through this varied\r\nlandscape. More beautiful sites for fine mansions could not well be,\r\nand it is difficult to suppose so lovely a country should be so\r\nmalarious as it is before and after the rains, excessive heat probably\r\ndiffusing widely the miasma from small stagnant surfaces. We noticed a\r\nwild hog, absolutely the first wild beast of any size I saw on the\r\nplains, except the hispid hare (_Lepus hispidus_) and the barking deer\r\n(_Stylocerus ratna_). The hare we found to be the best game of this\r\npart of India, except the teal. The pheasants of Dorjiling are poor,\r\nthe deer all but uneatable, and the florican, however dressed, I\r\nconsidered a far from excellent bird.\r\n\r\nA good many plants grow along the streams, the sandy beds of which are\r\neverywhere covered with the marks of tigers’ feet. The only safe way of\r\nbotanizing is by pushing through the jungle on elephants; an\r\nuncomfortable method, from the quantity of ants and insects which drop\r\nfrom the foliage above, and from the risk of disturbing pendulous bees’\r\nand ants’ nests.\r\n\r\nA peculiar species of willow (_Salix tetrasperma_) is common here;\r\nwhich is a singular fact, as the genus is characteristic of cold and\r\narctic latitudes; and no species is found below 5000 feet elevation on\r\nthe Sikkim mountain, where it grows on the inner Himalaya only, some\r\nkinds ascending to 16,000 feet.\r\n\r\nEast of Siligoree the plains are unvaried by tree or shrub, and are\r\nbarren wastes of short turf or sterile sand, with the dwarf-palm\r\n(_Phœnix acaulis_), a sure sign of a most hungry soil.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the journey I performed on elephants during the heat\r\nof the day, and a more uncomfortable mode of conveyance surely never\r\nwas adopted; the camel’s pace is more fatiguing, but that of the\r\nelephant is extremely trying after a few miles, and is so injurious to\r\nthe human frame that the Mahouts (drivers) never reach an advanced age,\r\nand often succumb young to spine-diseases, brought on by the incessant\r\nmotion of the vertebral column. The broiling heat of the elephant’s\r\nblack back, and the odour of its oily driver, are disagreeable\r\naccompaniments, as are its habits of snorting water from its trunk over\r\nits parched skin, and the consequences of the great bulk of green food\r\nwhich it consumes.\r\n\r\nFrom Siligoree I made a careful examination of the gravel beds that\r\noccur on the road north to the foot of the hills, and thence over the\r\ntertiary sandstone to Punkabaree. At the Rukti river, which flows\r\nsouth-west, the road suddenly rises, and crosses the first considerable\r\nhill, about two miles south of any rock _in situ._ This river cuts a\r\ncliff from 60 to 100 feet high, composed of stratified sand and\r\nwater-worn gravel: further south, the spur declines into the plains,\r\nits course marked by the Sal that thrives on its gravelly soil. The\r\nroad then runs north-west over a plain to an isolated hill about 200\r\nfeet high, also formed of sand and gravel. We ascended to the top of\r\nthis, and found it covered with blocks of gneiss, and much angular\r\ndetritus. Hence the road gradually ascends, and becomes clayey.\r\nArgillaceous rocks, and a little ochreous sandstone appeared in\r\nhighly-inclined strata, dipping north, and covered with great\r\nwater-worn blocks of gneiss. Above, a flat terrace, flanked to the\r\neastward by a low wooded hill, and another rise of sandstone, lead on\r\nto the great Baisarbatti terrace.\r\n\r\n_Bombax, Erythrina,_ and _Duabanga_ (_Lagærstræmia grandiflora_), were\r\nin full flower, and with the profusion of _Bauhinia,_ rendered the\r\ntree-jungle gay: the two former are leafless when flowering. The\r\nDuabanga is the pride of these forests. Its trunk, from eight to\r\nfifteen feet in girth, is generally forked from the base, and the long\r\npendulous branches which clothe the trunk for 100 feet, are thickly\r\nleafy, and terminated by racemes of immense white flowers, which,\r\nespecially when in bud, smell most disagreeably of assafœtida. The\r\nmagnificent Apocyneous climber, _Beaumontia,_ was in full bloom,\r\nascending the loftiest trees, and clothing their trunks with its\r\nsplendid foliage and festoons of enormous funnel-shaped white flowers.\r\n\r\nThe report of a bed of iron-stone eight or ten miles west of Punkabaree\r\ndetermined our visiting the spot; and the locality being in a dense\r\njungle, the elephants were sent on ahead.\r\n\r\nWe descended to the terraces flanking the Balasun river, and struck\r\nwest along jungle-paths to a loosely-timbered flat. A sudden descent of\r\n150 feet landed us on a second terrace. Further on, a third dip of\r\nabout twenty feet (in some places obliterated) flanks the bed of the\r\nBalasun; the river itself being split into many channels at this\r\nseason. The west bank, which is forty feet high, is of stratified sand\r\nand gravel, with vast slightly-worn blocks of gneiss: from the top of\r\nthis we proceeded south-west for three miles to some Mechi villages,\r\nthe inhabitants of which flocked to meet us, bringing milk and\r\nrefreshments.\r\n\r\nThe Lohar-ghur, or “iron hill,” lies in a dense dry forest. Its\r\nplain-ward flanks are very steep, and covered with scattered\r\nweather-worn masses of ochreous and black iron-stone, many of which are\r\nseveral yards long: it fractures with faint metallic lustre, and is\r\nvery earthy in parts: it does not affect the compass. There are no\r\npebbles of iron-stone, nor water-worn rocks of any kind found with it.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones, close by, cropped out in thick beds (dip north 70°):\r\nthey are very soft, and beds of laminated clay, and of a slaty rock,\r\nare intercalated with them; also an excessively tough conglomerate,\r\nformed of an indurated blue or grey paste, with nodules of harder clay.\r\nThere are no traces of metal in the rock, and the lumps of ore are\r\nwholly superficial.\r\n\r\nBelow Punkabaree the Baisarbatti stream cuts through banks of gravel\r\noverlying the sandstone (dip north 65°). The sandstone is gritty and\r\nmicaceous, intercalated with beds of indurated shale and clay; in which\r\nI found the shaft (apparently) of a bone; there were also beds of the\r\nsame clay conglomerate which I had seen at Lohar-ghur, and thin seams\r\nof brown lignite; with a rhomboidal cleavage. In the bed of the stream\r\nwere carbonaceous shales, with obscure impressions of fern leaves, of\r\n_Trizygia,_ and _Vertebraria_: both fossils characteristic of the\r\nBurdwan coal-fields (see page 8), but too imperfect to justify any\r\nconclusion as to the relation between these formations.[131]\r\n\r\n [131] These traces of fossils are not sufficient to identify the\r\n formation with that of the sewalik hills of North-west India; but its\r\n contents, together with its strike, dip, and position relatively to\r\n the mountains, and its mineralogical character, incline me to suppose\r\n it may be similar. Its appearance in such small quantities in Sikkim\r\n (where it rises but a few hundred feet above the level of the sea,\r\n whereas in Kumaon it reaches 4000 feet), may be attributed to the\r\n greater amount of wearing which it must have undergone; the plains\r\n from which it rises being 1000 feet lower than those of Kumaon, and\r\n the sea having consequently retired later, exposing the Sikkim\r\n sandstone to the effects of denudation for a much longer period.\r\n Hitherto no traces of this rock, or of any belonging to a similar\r\n geological epoch, have been found in the valleys of Sikkim; but when\r\n the narrowness of these is considered, it will not appear strange that\r\n such may have been removed from their surfaces: first, by the action\r\n of a tidal ocean; and afterwards, by that of tropical rains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAscending the stream, these shales are seen _in situ,_ overlain by the\r\nmetamorphic clay-slate of the mountains, and dipping inwards\r\n(northwards) like them. This is at the foot of the Punkabaree spur, and\r\nclose to the bungalow, where a stream and land-slip expose good\r\nsections. The carbonaceous beds dip north 60° and 70°, and run east and\r\nwest; much quartz rock is intercalated with them, and soft white and\r\npink micaceous sandstones. The coal-seams are few in number, six to\r\ntwelve inches thick, very confused and distorted, and full of elliptic\r\nnodules, or spheroids of quartzy slate, covered with concentric scaly\r\nlayers of coal: they overlie the sandstones mentioned above. These\r\nscanty notices of superposition being collected in a country clothed\r\nwith the densest tropical forest, where a geologist pursues his\r\nfatiguing investigations under disadvantages that can hardly be\r\nrealized in England, will I fear long remain unconfirmed. I may\r\nmention, however, that the appearance of inversion of the strata at the\r\nfoot of great mountain-masses has been observed in the Alleghany chain,\r\nand I believe in the Alps.[132]\r\n\r\n [132] Dr. M‘Lelland informs me that in the Curruckpore hills, south of\r\n the Ganges, the clay-slates are overlain by beds of mica-slate,\r\n gneiss, and granite, which pass into one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A mech, native of the Sikkim Terai]\r\n\r\nA poor Mech was fishing in the stream, with a basket curiously formed\r\nof a cylinder of bamboo, cleft all round in innumerable strips, held\r\ntogether by the joints above and below; these strips being stretched\r\nout as a balloon in the middle, and kept apart by a hoop: a small hole\r\nis cut in the cage, and a mouse-trap entrance formed: the cage is\r\nplaced in the current with the open end upwards, where the fish get in,\r\nand though little bigger than minnows, cannot find their way out.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th we had a change in the weather: a violent storm from the\r\nsouth-west occurred at noon, with hail of a strange form, the stones\r\nbeing sections of hollow spheres, half an inch across and upwards,\r\nformed of cones with truncated apices and convex bases; these cones\r\nwere aggregated together with their bases outwards. The large masses\r\nwere followed by a shower of the separate conical pieces, and that by\r\nheavy rain. On the mountains this storm was most severe: the stones lay\r\nat Dorjiling for seven days, congealed into masses of ice several feet\r\nlong and a foot thick in sheltered places: at Purneah, fifty miles\r\nsouth, stones one and two inches across fell, probably as whole\r\nspheres.\r\n\r\nAscending to Khersiong, I found the vegetation very backward by the\r\nroad-sides. The rain had cleared the atmosphere, and the view over the\r\nplains was brilliant. On the top of the Khersiong spur a tremendous\r\ngale set in with a cold west wind: the storm cleared off at night,\r\nwhich at 10 p.m. was beautiful, with forked and sheet lightning over\r\nthe plains far below us. The equinoctial gales had now fairly set in,\r\nwith violent south-east gales, heavy thunder, lightning, and rain.\r\n\r\nWhilst at Khersiong I took advantage of the very fair section afforded\r\nby the road from Punkabaree, to examine the structure of the spur,\r\nwhich seems to be composed of very highly inclined contorted beds (dip\r\nnorth) of metamorphic rocks, gneiss, mica-slate, clay-slate, and\r\nquartz; the foliation of which beds is parallel to the dip of the\r\nstrata. Over all reposes a bed of clay, capped with a layer of\r\nvegetable mould, nowhere so thick and rich as in the more humid regions\r\nof 7000 feet elevation. The rocks appeared in the following succession\r\nin descending. Along the top are found great blocks of very compact\r\ngneiss buried in clay. Half a mile lower the same rock appears, dipping\r\nnorth-north-east 50°. Below this, beds of saccharine quartz, with seams\r\nof mica, dip north-north-west 20°. Some of these quartz beds are folded\r\non themselves, and look like flattened trunks of trees, being composed\r\nof concentric layers, each from two to four inches thick: we exposed\r\ntwenty-seven feet of one fold running along the side of the road, which\r\nwas cut parallel to the strike. Each layer of quartz was separated from\r\nits fellows, by one of mica scales; and was broken up into cubical\r\nfragments, whose surfaces are no doubt cleavage and jointing places. I\r\nhad previously seen, but not understood, such flexures produced by\r\nmetamorphic action on masses of quartz when in a pasty state, in the\r\nFalkland Islands, where they have been perfectly well described by Mr.\r\nDarwin;[133] in whose views of the formation of these rocks I entirely\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n [133] Journal of Geological Society for 1846, p. 267, and “Voyage of\r\n the Beagle”.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flexures of the gneiss are incomparably more irregular and confused\r\nthan those of the quartz, and often contain flattened spheres of highly\r\ncrystalline felspar, that cleave perpendicularly to the shorter axis.\r\nThese spheres are disposed in layers parallel to the foliation of the\r\ngneiss: and are the result of a metamorphic action of great intensity,\r\neffecting a complete rearrangement and crystallization of the quartz\r\nand mica in parallel planes, whilst the felspar is aggregated in\r\nspheres; just as in the rearrangement of the mineral constituents of\r\nmica-schists, the alumina is crystallized in the garnets, and in the\r\nclay-slates the iron into pyrites.\r\n\r\nThe quartz below this dips north-north-west 45° to 50°, and alternates\r\nwith a very hard slaty schist, dipping north-west 45°, and still lower\r\nis a blue-grey clay-slate, dipping north-north-west 30°. These rest on\r\nbeds of slate, folded like the quartz mentioned above, but with\r\ncleavage-planes, forming lines radiating from the axis of each flexure,\r\nand running through all the concentric folds. Below this are the\r\nplumbago and clay slates of Punkabaree, which alternate with beds of\r\nmica-schist with garnets, and appear to repose immediately upon the\r\ncarboniferous strata and sandstone; but there is much disturbance at\r\nthe junction.\r\n\r\nOn re-ascending from Punkabaree, the rocks gradually appear more and\r\nmore dislocated, the clay-slate less so than the quartz and\r\nmica-schist, and that again far less than the gneiss, which is so\r\nshattered and bent, that it is impossible to say what is _in situ,_ and\r\nwhat not. Vast blocks lie superficially on the ridges; and the tops of\r\nall the outer mountains, as of Khersiong spur, of Tonglo, Sinchul, and\r\nDorjiling, appear a pile of such masses. Injected veins of quartz are\r\nrare in the lower beds of schist and clay-slate, whilst the gneiss is\r\noften full of them; and on the inner and loftier ranges, these quartz\r\nveins are replaced by granite with tourmaline.\r\n\r\nLime is only known as a stalactitic deposit from various streams, at\r\nelevations from 1000 to 7000 feet; one such stream occurs above\r\nPunkabaree, which I have not seen; another within the Sinchul range, on\r\nthe great Rungeet river, above the exit of the Rummai; a third wholly\r\nin the great central Himalayan range, flowing into the Lachen river.\r\nThe total absence of any calcareous rock in Sikkim, and the appearance\r\nof the deposit in isolated streams at such distant localities, probably\r\nindicates a very remote origin of the lime-charged waters.\r\n\r\nFrom Khersiong to Dorjiling, gneiss is the only rock, and is often\r\ndecomposed into clay-beds, 20 feet deep, in which the narrow, often\r\nzigzag folia of quartz remain quite entire and undisturbed, whilst\r\nevery trace of the foliation of the softer mineral is lost.\r\n\r\nAt Pacheem, Dorjiling weather, with fog and drizzle, commenced, and\r\ncontinued for two days: we, reached Dorjiling on the 24th of March, and\r\nfound that the hail which had fallen on the 20th was still lying in\r\ngreat masses of crumbling ice in sheltered spots. The fall had done\r\ngreat damage to the gardens, and Dr. Campbell’s tea-plants were cut to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pocket-comb used by the mech tribes]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Himalaya & Tibet]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sikkim and Eastern Nepal]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Kinchinjunga from Singtam, looking\r\nnorth-westward]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nArrangements for second journey into Sikkim—Opposition of Dewan—Lassoo\r\nKajee—Tendong—Legend of flood—Lama of Sillok-foke—Namtchi—Tchebu\r\nLama—Top of Tendong—Gigantic oak—Plants—Teesta valley—Commencement of\r\nrains—Bhomsong—Ascent to Lathiang—View—Bad road—Orcbids—Gorh—Opposition\r\nof Lama—Arrival of Meepo—Cross Teesta—Difficulties of\r\ntravelling—Lepchas swimming—Moxa for sprains—Singtam—Grandeur of view\r\nof Kinchinjunga—Wild men—Singtam Soubah—Landslips—Bees’-nests and\r\nhoney-seekers—Leeches, etc.—Chakoong—Vegetation—Gravel\r\nterraces—Unpleasant effects of wormwood—Choongtam, scenery and\r\nvegetation of—Inhabitants—Tibetan salute—Lamas—Difficulty of procuring\r\nfood—Contrast of vegetation of inner and outer\r\nHimalaya—Rhododendrons—Yew—_Abies Brunoniana_—Venomous snakes—Hornets\r\nand other insects—Choongtam temple—Pictures of Lhassa—Minerals—Scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my return from the Terai, I was occupied during the month of\r\nApril in preparations for an expedition to the loftier parts of Sikkim.\r\nThe arrangements were the same as for my former journey, except with\r\nregard to food, which it was necessary should be sent out to me at\r\nintervals; for we had had ample proof that the resources of the country\r\nwere not equal to provisioning a party of from forty to fifty men, even\r\nhad the Dewan been favourable to my travelling, which was clearly not\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell communicated to the Rajah my intention of starting early\r\nin May for the upper Teesta valley, and, in the Governor-General’s\r\nname, requested that he would facilitate my visiting the frontier of\r\nSikkim, north-east of Kinchinjunga. The desired permission was, after a\r\nlittle delay, received; which appeared to rouse the Dewan to institute\r\na series of obstructions to my progress, which caused so many delays\r\nthat my exploration of the country was not concluded till October, and\r\nI was prevented returning to Dorjiling before the following Christmas.\r\n\r\nSince our visit to the Rajah in December, no Vakeel (agent) had been\r\nsent by the Durbar to Dorjiling, and consequently we could only\r\ncommunicate indirectly with his Highness, while we found it impossible\r\nto ascertain the truth of various reports promulgated by the Dewan, and\r\nmeant to deter me from entering the country. In April, the Lassoo Kajee\r\nwas sent as Vakeel, but, having on a previous occasion been dismissed\r\nfor insolence and incapacity, and again rejected when proposed by the\r\nDewan at Bhomsong, he was refused an audience; and he encamped at the\r\nbottom of the Great Rungeet valley, where he lost some of his party\r\nthrough fever. He retired into Sikkim, exasperated, pretending that he\r\nhad orders to delay my starting, in consequence of the death of the\r\nheir apparent; and that he was prepared to use strong measures should I\r\ncross the frontier.\r\n\r\nNo notice was taken of these threats: the Rajah was again informed of\r\nmy intended departure, unless his own orders to the contrary were\r\nreceived through a proper accredited agent, and I left Dorjiling on the\r\n3rd of May, accompanied by Dr. Campbell, who insisted on seeing me\r\nfairly over the frontier at the Great Rungeet river.\r\n\r\nArrangements were made for supplies of rice following me by\r\ninstalments; our daily consumption being 80 lbs., a man’s load. After\r\ncrossing into Sikkim, I mustered my party at the Great Rungeet river. I\r\nhad forty-two in all, of whom the majority were young Lepchas, or\r\nSikkim-born people of Tibetan races: all were active and cheerful\r\nlooking follows; only one was goitred, and he had been a salt-trader. I\r\nwas accompanied by a guard of five Sepoys, and had a Lepcha and Tibetan\r\ninterpreter. I took but one personal servant, a Portuguese half-caste\r\n(John Hoffman by name), who cooked for me: he was a native of Calcutta,\r\nand though hardy, patient, and long-suffering, and far better-tempered,\r\nwas, in other respects, very inferior to Clamanze, who had been my\r\nservant the previous year, and who, having been bred to the sea, was as\r\nhandy as he was clever; but who, like all other natives of the plains,\r\ngrew intolerably weary of the hills, and left me.\r\n\r\nThe first part of my route lay over Tendong, a very fine mountain,\r\nwhich rises 8,613 feet, and is a conspicuous feature from Dorjiling,\r\nwhere it is known as Mount Ararat. The Lepchas have a curious legend of\r\na man and woman having saved themselves on its summit, during a flood\r\nthat once deluged Sikkim. The coincidence of this story with the\r\nEnglish name of Ararat suggests the probability of the legend being\r\nfabulous; but I am positively assured that it is not so, but that it\r\nwas current amongst the Lepchas before its English name was heard of,\r\nand that the latter was suggested from the peculiar form of its summit\r\nresembling that given in children’s books as the resting-place of the\r\nark.\r\n\r\nThe ascent from the Great Rungeet (alt. 818 feet) is through dry woods\r\nof Sal and Pines (_P. longifolia_). I camped the first night at the\r\nvillage of Mikk (alt. 3,900 feet), and on the following day ascended to\r\nNamtc (alt. 5,600 feet).\r\n\r\nOn the route I was met by the Lama of Silokfoke Goompa. Though a\r\nresident on the Lassoo Kajee’s estates, he politely brought me a\r\npresent, at the same time apologising for not waiting till I had\r\nencamped, owing to his excessive fat, which prevented his climbing. I\r\naccepted his excuses, though well aware that his real reason was that\r\nhe wished to pay his respects, and show his good feeling, in private.\r\nBesides his ordinary canonicals, he carried a tall crozier-headed\r\nstaff, and had a curious horn slung round his neck, full of amulets; it\r\nwas short, of a transparent red colour, and beautifully carved, and was\r\nthat of the small cow of Lhassa, which resembles the English species,\r\nand is not a yak (it is called “Tundro”).\r\n\r\nNamtchi was once a place of considerable importance; and still\r\npossesses a mendong, with six rows of inscribed slabs; a temple, and a\r\nLama attached thereto: the latter waited on me soon after I had\r\nencamped, but he brought no present, and I was not long kept in\r\nsuspense as to his motives. These people are poor dissemblers; if they\r\nintend to obstruct, they do it clumsily and hesitatingly: in this\r\ninstance the Lama first made up to my people, and, being coolly\r\nreceived, kept gradually edging up to my tent-door, where, after an\r\nawkward salute, he delivered himself with a very bad grace of his\r\nmission, which was from the Lassoo Kajee to stop my progress. I told\r\nhim I knew nothing of the Lassoo Kajee or his orders, and should\r\nproceed on the following morning: he then urged the bad state of the\r\nroads, and advised me to wait two days till he should receive orders\r\nfrom the Rajah; upon which I dismissed him.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, as I sat at my tent-door, looking along the narrow\r\nbushy ridge that winds up the mountain, I saw twenty or thirty men\r\nrapidly descending the rocky path: they were Lepchas, with blue and\r\nwhite striped garments, bows and quivers, and with their long knives\r\ngleaming in the sun: they seemed to be following a figure in red Lama\r\ncostume, with a scarlet silk handkerchief wound round his head, its\r\nends streaming behind him. Though expecting this apparition to prove\r\nthe renowned Kajee and his myrmidons, coming to put a sudden\r\ntermination to my progress, I could not help admiring the exceeding\r\npicturesqueness of the scenery and party. My fears were soon dissipated\r\nby my men joyfully shouting, “The Tchebu Lama! the Tchebu Lama!” and I\r\nsoon recognised the rosy face and twinkling eyes of my friend of\r\nBhomsong, the only man of intelligence about the Rajah’s court, and the\r\none whose services as Vakeel were particularly wanted at Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nHe told me that the Lassoo Kajee had orders (from whom, he would not\r\nsay) to stop my progress, but that I should proceed nevertheless, and\r\nthat there was no objection to my doing so; and he despatched a\r\nmessenger to the Rajah, announcing my progress, and requesting him to\r\nsend me a guide, and to grant me every facility, asserting that he had\r\nall along fully intended doing so.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Lama proceeded to Dorjiling, and I\r\ncontinued the ascent of Tendong, sending my men round the shoulder to\r\nTemi in the Teesta valley, where I proposed to pass the night. The road\r\nrapidly ascends by a narrow winding path, covered with a loose forest\r\nof oaks, rhododendrons, and various shrubs, not found at equal\r\nelevations on the wetter Dorjiling ranges: amongst, them the beautiful\r\nlaburnum-like _Piptanthus Nepalensis,_ with golden blossoms, was\r\nconspicuous. Enormous blocks of white and red stratified quartz, and\r\nslate, some 20 and even 40 yards long, rest on the narrow ridge at 7000\r\nfeet elevation. The last ascent is up a steep rounded cone with a broad\r\nflat top, covered with dwarf bamboo, a few oaks, laurels, magnolias,\r\nand white-flowered rhododendron trees (_R. argenteum_), which\r\nobstructed the view. I hung the barometers near one of the many chaits\r\non the summit, where there is also a rude temple, in which worship is\r\nperformed once a year. The elevation is 8,671 feet by my\r\nobservations.[134] The geological formation of Tendong in some measure\r\naccounts for its peculiar form. On the conical summit are hard\r\nquartzoze porphyries, which have apparently forced up the gneiss and\r\nslates, which dip in all directions from the top, and are full of\r\ninjected veins of quartz. Below 7000 feet, mica-schist prevails, always\r\ninclined at a very high angle; and I found jasper near Namtchi, with\r\nother indications of Plutonic action.\r\n\r\n [134] 8,663 by Col. Waugh’s trigonometrical observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe descent on the north side was steep, through a rank vegetation,\r\nvery different from that of the south face. The oaks are very grand,\r\nand I measured one (whose trunk was decayed, and split into three,\r\nhowever), which I found to be 49 feet in girth at 5 feet from the\r\nground. Near Temi (alt. 4,770 feet) I gathered the fruit of _Kadsura,_\r\na climbing plant allied to Magnolia, bearing round heads of large\r\nfleshy red drupes, which are pleasantly acid and much eaten; the seeds\r\nare very aromatic.\r\n\r\nFrom Temi the road descends to the Teesta, the course of which it\r\nafterwards follows. The valley was fearfully hot, and infested with\r\nmosquitos and peepsas. Many fine plants grew in it:[135] I especially\r\nnoticed _Aristolochia saccata,_ which climbs the loftiest trees,\r\nbearing its curious pitcher-shaped flowers near the ground only; its\r\nleaves are said to be good food for cattle. _Houttuynia,_ a curious\r\nherb allied to pepper, grew on the banks, which, from the profusion of\r\nits white flowers, resembled strawberry-beds; the leaves are eaten by\r\nthe Lepchas. But the most magnificent plant of these jungles is\r\n_Hodgsonia,_ (a genus I have dedicated to my friend, Mr. Hodgson), a\r\ngigantic climber allied to the gourd, bearing immense yellowish-white\r\npendulous blossoms, whose petals have a fringe of buff-coloured curling\r\nthreads, several inches long. The fruit is of a rich brown, like a\r\nsmall melon in form, and contains six large nuts, whose kernels (called\r\n“Katior-pot” by the Lepchas) are eaten. The stem, when cut, discharges\r\nwater profusely from whichever end is held downwards. The “Took”\r\n(_Hydnocarpus_) is a beautiful evergreen tree, with tufts of yellow\r\nblossoms on the trunk: its fruit is as large as an orange, and is used\r\nto poison fish, while from the seeds an oil is expressed. Tropical oaks\r\nand Terminalias are the giants of these low forests, the latter\r\nespecially, having buttressed trunks, appear truly gigantic; one, of a\r\nkind called “Sung-lok,” measured 47 feet in girth, at 5 feet, and 21 at\r\n15 feet from the ground, and was fully 200 feet high. I could only\r\nprocure the leaves by firing a ball into the crown. Some of their\r\ntrunks lay smouldering on the ground, emitting a curious smell from the\r\nmineral matter in their ashes, of whose constituents an account will be\r\nfound in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n [135] Especially upon the broad terraces of gravel, some of which are\r\n upwards of a mile long, and 200 feet above the stream: they are\r\n covered with boulders of rock, and are generally opposite feeders of\r\n the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds are very rare, as is all animal life but insects, and a small\r\nfresh-water crab, _Thelphusa,_ (“Ti-hi” of the Lepchas). Shells, from\r\nthe absence of lime, are extremely scarce, and I scarcely picked up a\r\nsingle specimen: the most common are species of _Cyclostoma._\r\n\r\nThe rains commenced on the 10th of May, greatly increasing the\r\ndiscomforts of travelling, but moderating the heat by drenching\r\nthunder-storms, which so soaked the men’s loads, that I was obliged to\r\nhalt a day in the Teesta valley to have waterproof covers made of\r\nplatted bamboo-work, enclosing Phrynium leaves. I was delighted to find\r\nthat my little tent was impervious to water, though its thickness was\r\nbut of one layer of blanket: it was a single ridge with two poles, 7\r\nfeet high, 8 feet long, and 8 feet broad at the base, forming nearly an\r\nequilateral triangle in front.\r\n\r\nBhomsong was looking more beautiful than ever in its rich summer\r\nclothing of tropical foliage. I halted during an hour of heavy rain on\r\nthe spot where I had spent the previous Christmas, and could not help\r\nfeeling doubly lonely in a place where every rock and tree reminded me\r\nof that pleasant time. The isolation of my position, the hostility of\r\nthe Dewan, and consequent uncertainty of the success of a journey that\r\nabsorbed all my thoughts, the prevalence of fevers in the valleys I was\r\ntraversing, and the many difficulties that beset my path, all crowded\r\non the imagination when fevered by exertion and depressed by gloomy\r\nweather, and my spirits involuntarily sank as I counted the many miles\r\nand months intervening between me and my home.\r\n\r\nThe little flat on which I had formerly encamped was now covered with a\r\nbright green crop of young rice. The house then occupied by the Dewan\r\nwas now empty and unroofed; but the suspension bridge had been\r\nrepaired, and its light framework of canes, spanning the boiling flood\r\nof the Teesta, formed a graceful object in this most beautiful\r\nlandscape. The temperature of the river was 58°, only 7° above that of\r\nmid-winter, owing to the now melting snows. I had rather expected to\r\nmeet either with a guide, or with some further obstruction here, but as\r\nnone appeared, I proceeded onwards as soon as the weather moderated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pandanus. Sikkim screw-pine]\r\n\r\nHigher up, the scenery resembles that of Tchintam on the Tambur: the\r\nbanks are so steep as to allow of no road, and the path ascends from\r\nthe river, at 1000 feet, to Lathiang village, at 4,800 feet, up a wild,\r\nrocky torrent that descends from Mainom to the Teesta. The cliffs here\r\nare covered with wild plantains and screw-pines (_Pandanus_), 50 feet\r\nhigh, that clasp the rocks with cable-like roots, and bear one or two\r\ncrowns of drooping leaves, 5 feet long: two palms, Rattan (_Calamus_)\r\nand _Areca gracilis,_ penetrate thus far up the Teesta valley, but are\r\nscarcely found further.\r\n\r\nFrom the village the view was superb, embracing the tropical gulley\r\nbelow, with the flat of Bhomsong deep down in the gorge, its bright\r\nrice-fields gleaming like emeralds amid the dark vegetation that\r\nsurrounded it; the Teesta winding to the southward, the pine-clad rocky\r\ntop of Mainom, 10,613 feet high, to the south-west, the cone of Mount\r\nArarat far to the south, to the north black mountains tipped with snow,\r\nand to the east the magnificent snowy range of Chola, girdling the\r\nvalley of the Ryott with a diadem of frosted silver. The coolies, each\r\ncarrying upwards of 80 lb. load, had walked twelve hours that day, and\r\nbesides descending 2000 feet, they had ascended nearly 4000 feet, and\r\ngone over innumerable ups and downs besides.\r\n\r\nBeyond Lathiang, a steep and dangerous path runs along the east flank\r\nof Mainom, sometimes on narrow ledges of dry rock, covered with long\r\ngrass, sometimes dipping into wooded gullies, full of _Edgeworthia\r\nGardneri_ and small trees of Andromeda and rhododendron, covered with\r\norchids[136] of great beauty.\r\n\r\n [136] Especially some species of _Sunipia_ and _Cirrhopetalum,_ whicb\r\n have not yet been introduced into England.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescending to Gorh (4,100 feet), I was met by the Lama of that\r\ndistrict, a tall, disagreeable-looking fellow, who informed me that the\r\nroad ahead was impassable. The day being spent, I was obliged to camp\r\nat any rate; after which he visited me in full canonicals, bringing me\r\na handsome present, but assuring me that he had no authority to let me\r\nadvance. I treated him with civility, and regretted my objects being so\r\nimperative, and my orders so clear, that I was obliged to proceed on\r\nthe following morning: on which he abruptly decamped, as I suspected,\r\nin order to damage the paths and bridges. He came again at daylight,\r\nand expostulated further; but finding it of no use, he volunteered to\r\naccompany me, officiously offering me the choice of two roads. I asked\r\nfor the coolest, knowing full well that it was useless to try and\r\nout-wit him in such matters. At the first stream the bridge was\r\ndestroyed, but seeing the planks peeping through the bushes in which\r\nthey had been concealed, I desired the Lama to repair it, which he did\r\nwithout hesitation. So it was at every point: the path was cumbered\r\nwith limbs of trees, crossing-stones were removed from the streams, and\r\nall natural difficulties were increased. I kept constantly telling the\r\nLama that as he had volunteered to show me the road, I felt sure he\r\nintended to remove all obstacles, and accordingly I put him to all the\r\ntrouble I possibly could, which he took with a very indifferent grace.\r\nWhen I arrived at the swinging bridge across the Teesta, I found that\r\nthe canes were loosened, and that slips of bamboo, so small as nearly\r\nto escape observation, were ingeniously placed low down over the single\r\nbamboo that formed the footing, intended to trip up the unwary\r\npassenger, and overturn him into the river, which was deep, and with a\r\nviolent current. Whilst the Lama was cutting these, one of my party\r\nfound a charcoal writing on a tree, announcing the speedy arrival from\r\nthe Rajah of my old guide, Meepo; and he shortly afterwards appeared,\r\nwith instructions to proceed with me, though not to the Tibetan\r\nfrontier. The lateness of the season, the violence of the rains, and\r\nthe fears, on the Rajah’s part, that I might suffer from fever or\r\naccident, were all urged to induce me to return, or at least only to\r\nfollow the west branch of the Teesta to Kinchinjunga. These reasons\r\nfailing, I was threatened with Chinese interference on the frontier.\r\nAll these objections I overruled, by refusing to recognise any\r\ninstructions that were not officially communicated to the\r\nSuperintendent of Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nThe Gorh Lama here took leave of me: he was a friend of the Dewan, and\r\nwas rather surprised to find that the Rajah had sent me a guide, and\r\nnow attempted to pass himself off as my friend, pompously charging\r\nMeepo with the care of me, and bidding me a very polite farewell. I\r\ncould not help telling him civilly, but plainly, what I thought of him;\r\nand so we parted.\r\n\r\nMeepo was very glad to join my party again: he is a thorough Lepcha in\r\nheart, a great friend of his Rajah and of Tchebu Lama, and one who both\r\nfears and hates the Dewan. He assured me of the Rajah’s good wishes and\r\nintentions, but spoke with great doubt as to the probability of a\r\nsuccessful issue to my journey: he was himself ignorant of the road,\r\nbut had brought a guide, whose appearance, however, was against him,\r\nand who turned out to be sent as a spy on us both.\r\n\r\nInstead of crossing the Teesta here, we kept on for two days up its\r\nwest bank, to a cane bridge at Lingo, where the bed of the river is\r\nstill only 2000 feet above the sea, though 45 miles distant from the\r\nplains, and flowing in a valley bounded by mountains 12,000 to 16,000\r\nfeet high. The heat was oppressive, from the closeness of the\r\natmosphere, the great power of the sun, now high at noon-day, and the\r\nreflection from the rocks. Leeches began to swarm as the damp\r\nincreased, and stinging flies of various kinds. My clothes were\r\ndrenched with perspiration during five hours of every day, and the\r\ncrystallising salt irritated the skin. On sitting down to rest, I was\r\novercome with languor and sleep, and, but for the copious supply of\r\nfresh water everywhere, travelling would have been intolerable. The\r\nCoolies were all but naked, and were constantly plunging into the pools\r\nof the rivers; for, though filthy in their persons, they revel in cold\r\nwater in summer. They are powerful swimmers, and will stem a very\r\nstrong current, striking out with each arm alternately. It is an\r\nanimated sight when twenty or thirty of these swarthy children of\r\nnature are disporting their muscular figures in the water, diving after\r\nlarge fish, and sometimes catching them by tickling them under the\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nOf plants I found few not common at similar elevations below Dorjiling,\r\nexcept another kind of Tree-fern,[137] whose pith is eaten in times of\r\nscarcity. The India-rubber fig penetrates thus far amongst the\r\nmountains, but is of small size. A Gentian, _Arenaria,_ and some\r\nsub-alpine plants are met with, though the elevation is only 2000 feet,\r\nand the whole climate thoroughly tropical: they were annuals usually\r\nfound at 7000 to 10,000 feet elevation, and were growing here on mossy\r\nrocks, cooled by the spray of the river, whose temperature was only\r\n56·3°. My servant having severely sprained his wrist by a fall, the\r\nLepchas wanted to apply a moxa, which they do by lighting a piece of\r\npuff-ball, or Nepal paper that burns like tinder, laying it on the\r\nskin, and blowing it till a large open sore is produced: they shook\r\ntheir heads at my treatment, which consisted in transferring some of\r\nthe leeches from our persons to the inflamed part.\r\n\r\n [137] _Alsophila spinulosa,_ the “Pugjik” of the Lepchas, who eat the\r\n soft watery pith: it is abundant in East Bengal and the Peninsula of\r\n India. The other Sikkim Tree-fern, _A. gigantea,_ is far more common\r\n from the level of the plains to 6,500 elevation, and is found as far\r\n south as Java.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Teesta by the cane bridge of Lingo, our route lay\r\nover a steep and lofty spur, round which the river makes a great sweep.\r\nOn the ascent of this ridge we passed large villages on flats\r\ncultivated with buckwheat. The saddle is 5,500 feet high, and thence a\r\nrapid descent leads to the village of Singtam, which faces the north,\r\nand is 300 feet lower, and 3000 feet above the river, which is here no\r\nlonger called the Teesta, but is known as the Lachen-Lachoong, from its\r\ndouble origin in the rivers of these names, which unite at Choongtam,\r\ntwenty miles higher up. Of these, the source of the Lachen is in the\r\nCholamoo lakes in Tibet; while the Lachoong rises on the south flank of\r\nDonkia mountain, both many marches north of my present position. At\r\nSingtam the Lacben-Lachoong runs westward, till joined by the Rihi from\r\nthe north, and the Rinoong from the west, after receiving which it\r\nassumes the name of Teesta: of these affluents, the Rinoong is the\r\nlargest, and drains the south-east face of Kinchinjunga and Pundim, and\r\nthe north of Nursing: all which mountains are seen to the\r\nnorth-north-west of Singtam. The Rinoong valley is cultivated for\r\nseveral miles up, and has amongst others the village and Lamasery of\r\nBah. Beyond this the view of black, rugged precipices with snowy\r\nmountains towering above them, is one of the finest in Sikkim. There is\r\na pass in that direction, from Bah over the Tckonglah to the Thlonok\r\nvalley, and thence to the province of Jigatzi in Tibet, but it is\r\nalmost impracticable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Kinchinjunga from Singtam, looking\r\nnorth-westward]\r\n\r\nA race of wild men, called “Harrum-mo,” are said to inhabit the head of\r\nthe valley, living in the woods of a district called Mund-po, beyond\r\nBah; tbey shun habitations, speak an unintelligible tongue, have more\r\nhair on the face than Lepchas, and do not plait that of their heads,\r\nbut wear it in a knot; they use the bow and arrow, and eat snakes and\r\nvermin, which the Lepchas will not touch. Such is the account I have\r\nheard, and which is certainly believed in Sikkim: similar stories are\r\nvery current in half civilized countries; and if this has any truth, it\r\npossibly refers to the Chepangs,[138] a very remarkable race, of\r\ndoubtful affinity and origin, inhabiting the Nepal forests.\r\n\r\n [138] Hodgson, in “Bengal Asiatic Society’s Journal” for 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Singtam I was waited on by the Soubah of the district, a tall portly\r\nBhoteea, who was destined to prove a most active enemy to my pursuits.\r\nHe governs the country between Gorh and the Tibet frontier, for the\r\nMaha-Raanee (wife of the Rajah), whose dowry it is; and she being the\r\nDewan’s relative, I had little assistance to expect from her agent. His\r\nconduct was very polite, and he brought me a handsome offering for\r\nmyself; but after delaying me a day on the pretext of collecting food\r\nfor my people, of which I was in want, I was obliged to move on with no\r\naddition to my store, and trust to obtaining some at the next village,\r\nor from Dorjiling. Owing, however, to the increasing distance, and the\r\ndestruction of the roads by the rains, my supplies from that place were\r\nbecoming irregular: I therefore thought it prudent to reduce my party,\r\nby sending back my guard of Sepoys, who could be of no further use.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the upper portion of the course of the Teesta\r\n(Lachen-Lachoong) is materially different from what it is lower down;\r\nbecoming a boisterous torrent, as suddenly as the Tambur does above\r\nMywa Guola. Its bed is narrower, large masses of rock impede its\r\ncourse, nor is there any place where it is practicable for rafts at any\r\nseason; the only means of passing it being by cane bridges that are\r\nthrown across, high above the stream.\r\n\r\nThe slope on either side of the valley is very steep; that on the\r\nnorth, in particular, appearing too precipitous for any road, and being\r\nonly frequented by honey seekers, who scale the rocks by cane ladders,\r\nand thus reach the pendulous bees’-nests, which are so large as in some\r\ninstances to be conspicuous features at the distance of a mile. This\r\npursuit appeared extremely perilous, the long thread-like canes in many\r\nplaces affording the only footing, over many yards of cliff: the\r\nprocuring of this honey, however, is the only means by which many of\r\nthe idle poor raise the rent which they must pay to the Rajah.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent effect of the steepness of the valleys is the\r\nprevalence of land-slips, which sometimes descend for 3000 feet,\r\ncarrying devastation along their course: they are caused either by the\r\nmelting of the snow-beds on the mountains, or by the action of the\r\nrains on the stratified rocks, and are much increased in effect and\r\nviolence by the heavy timber-trees which, swaying forwards, loosen the\r\nearth at their roots, and give impetus to the mass. This phenomenon is\r\nas frequent and destructive as in Switzerland, where, however, more\r\nlives are lost; from the country being more populous, and from the\r\npeople recklessly building in places particularly exposed to such\r\naccidents. A most destructive one had, however, occurred here the\r\nprevious year, by which a village was destroyed, together with twelve\r\nof its inhabitants, and all the cattle. The fragments of rock\r\nprecipitated are sometimes of enormous size, but being a soft\r\nmica-schist, are soon removed by weathering. It is in the rainy season\r\nthat landslips are most frequent, and shortly after rain they are\r\npretty sure to be heard far or near. I crossed the débris of the great\r\none alluded to, on the first march beyond Singtam: the whole face of\r\nthe mountain appeared more or less torn up for fully a mile, presenting\r\na confused mass of white micaceous clay, full of angular masses of\r\nrock. The path was very difficult and dangerous, being carried along\r\nthe steep slope, at an angle, in some places, of 35°; and it was\r\nconstantly shifting, from the continued downward sliding, and from the\r\naction of streams, some of which are large, and cut deep channels. In\r\none I had the misfortune to lose my only sheep, which was carried away\r\nby the torrent. These streams were crossed by means of sticks and\r\nricketty bamboos, and the steep sides (sometimes twenty or thirty feet\r\nhigh), were ascended by notched poles.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued very hot for the elevation (4000 to 5000 feet),\r\nthe rain brought no coolness, and for the greater part of the three\r\nmarches between Singtam and Chakoong, we were either wading through\r\ndeep mud, or climbing over rocks. Leeches swarmed in incredible\r\nprofusion in the streams and damp grass, and among the bushes: they got\r\ninto my hair, hung on my eyelids, and crawled up my legs and down my\r\nback. I repeatedly took upwards of a hundred from my legs, where the\r\nsmall ones used to collect in clusters on the instep: the sores which\r\nthey produced were not healed for five months afterwards, and I retain\r\nthe scars to the present day. Snuff and tobacco leaves are the best\r\nantidote, but when marching in the rain, it is impossible to apply this\r\nsimple remedy to any advantage. The best plan I found to be rolling the\r\nleaves over the feet, inside the stockings, and powdering the legs with\r\nsnuff.\r\n\r\nAnother pest is a small midge, or sand-fly, which causes intolerable\r\nitching, and subsequent irritation, and is in this respect the most\r\ninsufferable torment in Sikkim; the minutest rent in one’s clothes is\r\ndetected by the acute senses of this insatiable bloodsucker, which is\r\nitself so small as to be barely visible without a microscope. We daily\r\narrived at our camping-ground, streaming with blood, and mottled with\r\nthe bites of peepsas, gnats, midges, and mosquitos, besides being\r\ninfested with ticks.\r\n\r\nAs the rains advanced, insects seemed to be called into existence in\r\ncountless swarms; large and small moths, cockchafers, glow-worms, and\r\ncockroaches, made my tent a Noah’s ark by night, when the candle was\r\nburning; together with winged ants, May-flies, flying earwigs, and many\r\nbeetles, while a very large species of _Tipula_ (daddy-long-legs) swept\r\nits long legs across my face as I wrote my journal, or plotted off my\r\nmap. After retiring to rest and putting out the light, they gradually\r\ndeparted, except a few which could not find the way out, and remained\r\nto disturb my slumbers.\r\n\r\nChakoong is a remarkable spot in the bottom of the valley, at an angle\r\nof the Lachen-Lachoong, which here receives an affluent from Gnarem, a\r\nmountain 17,557 feet high, on the Chola range to the east.[139] There\r\nis no village, but some grass huts used by travellers, which are built\r\nclose to the river on a very broad flat, fringed with alder, hornbeam,\r\nand birch: the elevation is 4,400 feet, and many European genera not\r\nfound about Dorjiling, and belonging to the temperate Himalaya, grow\r\nintermixed with tropical plants that are found no further north. The\r\nbirch, willow, alder, and walnut grow side by side with wild plantain,\r\n_Erythrina, Wallichia_ palm, and gigantic bamboos: the _Cedrela Toona,_\r\nfigs, _Melastoma, Scitamineæ,_ balsams, _Pothos,_ peppers, and gigantic\r\nclimbing vines, grow mixed with brambles, speedwell, _Paris,_\r\nforget-me-not, and nettles that sting like poisoned arrows. The wild\r\nEnglish strawberry is common, but bears a tasteless fruit: its\r\ninferiority is however counterbalanced by the abundance of a grateful\r\nyellow raspberry. Parasitical Orchids (_Dendrobium nobile,_ and\r\n_densiflorum,_ etc.), cover the trunks of oaks, while _Thalictrum_ and\r\n_Geranium_ grow under their shade. _Monotropa_ and _Balanophora,_ both\r\nparasites on the roots of trees (the one a native of north Europe and\r\nthe other of a tropical climate), push their leafless stems and heads\r\nof flowers through the soil together: and lastly, tree-ferns grow\r\nassociated with the _Pteris aquilina_ (brake) and _Lycopodium clavatum_\r\nof our British moors; and amongst mosses, the superb Himalayan _Lyellia\r\ncrispa,_[140] with the English _Funaria hygrometrica._\r\n\r\n [139] This is called Black Rock in Col. Waugh’s map. I doubt Gnarem\r\n being a generally known name: the people hardly recognise the mountain\r\n as sufficiently conspicuous to bear a name.\r\n\r\n\r\n [140] This is one of the most remarkable mosses in the Himalaya\r\n mountains, and derives additional interest from having been named\r\n after the late Charles Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, the father of the\r\n most eminent geologist of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dense jungles of Chakoong completely cover the beautiful flat\r\nterraces of stratified sand and gravel, which rise in three shelves to\r\n150 feet above the river, and whose edges appear as sharply cut as if\r\nthe latter had but lately retired from them. They are continuous with a\r\nline of quartzy cliffs, covered with scarlet rhododendrons, and in the\r\nholes of which a conglomerate of pebbles is found, 150 feet above the\r\nriver. Everywhere immense boulders are scattered about, some of which\r\nare sixty yards long: their surfaces are water-worn into hollows,\r\nproving the river to have cut through nearly 300 feet of deposit, which\r\nonce floored its valley. Lower down the valley, and fully 2000 feet\r\nabove the river, I had passed numerous angular blocks resting on gentle\r\nslopes where no landslips could possibly have deposited them; and which\r\nI therefore refer to ancient glacial action: one of these, near the\r\nvillage of Niong, was nearly square, eighty feet long, and ten high.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that this hot, damp gorge is never malarious;\r\nthis is attributable to the coolness of the river, and to the water on\r\nthe flats not stagnating; for at Choongtam, a march further north, and\r\n1,500 feet higher, fevers and ague prevail in summer on similar flats,\r\nbut which have been cleared of jungle, and are therefore exposed to the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nI had had constant headache for several mornings on waking, which I did\r\nnot fail to attribute to coming fever, or to the unhealthiness of the\r\nclimate; till I accidentally found it to arise from the wormwood, upon\r\na thick couch of the cut branches of which I was accustomed to sleep,\r\nand which in dry weather produced no such effects.[141]\r\n\r\n [141] This wormwood (_Artemisia Indaca_) is one of the most common\r\n Sikkim plants at 2000 to 6000 feet elevation, and grows twelve feet\r\n high: it is a favourite food of goats.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chakoong to Choongtam the route lay northwards, following the\r\ncourse of the river, or crossing steep spurs of vertical strata of\r\nmica-schist, that dip into the valley, and leave no space between their\r\nperpendicular sides and the furious torrent. Immense landslips seamed\r\nthe steep mountain flanks; and we crossed with precipitation one that\r\nextended fully 4000 feet (and perhaps much more) up a mountain 12,000\r\nfeet high, on the east bank: it moves every year, and the mud and rocks\r\nshot down by it were strewn with the green leaves and twigs of shrubs,\r\nsome of the flowers on which were yet fresh and bright, while others\r\nwere crushed: these were mixed with gigantic trunks of pines, with\r\nragged bark and scored timbers. The talus which had lately been poured\r\ninto the valley formed a gently sloping bank, twenty feet high, over\r\nwhich the Lachen- Lachoong rolled, from a pool above, caused by the\r\ndamming up of its waters. On either side of the pool were cultivated\r\nterraces of stratified sand and pebbles, fifty feet high, whose\r\nalder-fringed banks, joined by an elegant cane bridge, were reflected\r\nin the placid water; forming a little spot of singular quiet and\r\nbeauty, that contrasted with the savage grandeur of the surrounding\r\nmountains, and the headstrong course of the foaming torrent below, amid\r\nwhose deafening roar it was impossible to speak and be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cane-bridge and Tukcham mountain]\r\n\r\nThe mountain of Choongtam is about 10,000 feet high; it divides the\r\nLachen from the Lachoong river, and terminates a lofty range that runs\r\nfor twenty-two miles south from the lofty mountain of Kinchinjhow. Its\r\nsouth exposed face is bare of trees, except clumps of pines towards the\r\ntop, and is very steep, grassy, and rocky, without water. It is hence\r\nquite unlike the forest-clad mountains further south, and indicates a\r\ndrier and more sunny climate. The scenery much resembles that of\r\nSwitzerland, and of the north-west Himalaya, especially in the great\r\ncontrast between the southern and northern exposures, the latter being\r\nalways clothed with a dense vegetation. At the foot of this very steep\r\nmountain is a broad triangular flat, 5,270 feet above the sea, and 300\r\nfeet above the river, to which it descends by three level cultivated\r\nshelves. The village, consisting of a temple and twenty houses, is\r\nplaced on the slope of the hill. I camped on the flat in May, before it\r\nbecame very swampy, close to some great blocks of gneiss, of which many\r\nlie on its surface: it was covered with tufts of sedge (like _Carex\r\nstellulata_), and fringed with scarlet rhododendron, walnut,\r\n_Andromeda, Elæagnus_ (now bearing pleasant acid fruit), and small\r\ntrees of a _Photinia,_ a plant allied to hawthorn, of the leaves of\r\nwhich the natives make tea (as they do of _Gualtheria, Andromeda,\r\nVaccinium,_ and other allied plants). Rice, cultivated[142] in pools\r\nsurrounded by low banks, was just peeping above ground; and scanty\r\ncrops of millet, maize, and buckwheat flourished on the slopes around.\r\n\r\n [142] Choongtam is in position and products analogous to Lelyp, on the\r\n Tambur (vol. i, page 204). Rice cultivation advances thus high up each\r\n valley, and at either place Bhoteeas replace the natives of the lower\r\n valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Choongtam are of Tibetan origin; few of them had\r\nseen an Englishman before, and they flocked out, displaying the most\r\neager curiosity: the Lama and Phipun (or superior officer) of the\r\nLachoong valley came to pay their respects with a troop of followers,\r\nand there was lolling out of tongues, and scratching of ears, at every\r\nsentence spoken, and every object of admiration. This extraordinary\r\nTibetan salute at first puzzled me excessively, nor was it until\r\nreading MM. Huc and Gabet’s travels on my return to England, that I\r\nknew of its being the _ton_ at Lhassa, and in all civilised parts of\r\nTibet.\r\n\r\nAs the valley was under the Singtam Soubah’s authority, I experienced a\r\ngood deal of opposition; and the Lama urged the wrath of the gods\r\nagainst my proceeding. This argument, I said, had been disposed of the\r\nprevious year, and I was fortunate in recognising one of my\r\nChangachelling friends, who set forth my kindly offices to the Lamas of\r\nthat convent, and the friendship borne me by its monks, and by those of\r\nPemiongchi. Many other modes of dissuading me were attempted, but with\r\nMeepo’s assistance I succeeded in gaining my point. The difficulty and\r\ndelays in remittance of food, caused by the landslips having destroyed\r\nthe road, had reduced our provisions to a very low ebb; and it became\r\nnot only impossible to proceed, but necessary to replenish my stores on\r\nthe spot. At first provisions enough were brought to myself, for the\r\nRajah had issued orders for my being cared for, and having some\r\npractice among the villagers in treating rheumatism and goîtres, I had\r\nthe power of supplying my own larder; but I found it impossible to buy\r\nfood for my people. At last, the real state of the case came out; that\r\nthe Rajah having gone to Choombi, his usual summer-quarters in Tibet,\r\nthe Dewan had issued orders that no food should be sold or given to my\r\npeople, and that no roads were to be repaired during my stay in the\r\ncountry; thus cutting off my supplies from Dorjiling, and, in short,\r\nattempting to starve me out. At this juncture, Meepo received a letter\r\nfrom the Durbar purporting to be from the Rajah, commanding my\r\nimmediate return, on the grounds that I had been long enough in the\r\ncountry for my objects: it was not addressed to me, and I refused to\r\nreceive it as an official communication; following up my refusal by\r\ntelling Meepo that if he thought his orders required it, he had better\r\nleave me and return to the Rajah, as I should not stir without\r\ndirections from Dr. Campbell, except forwards. He remained, however,\r\nand said he had written to the Rajah, urging him to issue stringent\r\norders for my party being provisioned.\r\n\r\nWe were reduced to a very short allowance before the long-expected\r\nsupplies came, by which time our necessities had almost conquered my\r\nresolution not to take by force of the abundance I might see around,\r\nhowever well I might afterwards pay. It is but fair to state that the\r\nimprovident villagers throughout Sikkim are extremely poor in vegetable\r\nfood at this season, when the winter store is consumed, and the crops\r\nare still green. They are consequently obliged to purchase rice from\r\nthe lower valleys, which, owing to the difficulties of transport, is\r\nvery dear; and to obtain it they barter wool, blankets, musk, and\r\nTibetan produce of all kinds. Still they had cattle, which they would\r\nwillingly have sold to me, but for the Dewan’s orders.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference between the vegetation of Dorjiling and\r\nthat of similar elevations near Choongtam situated far within the\r\nHimalaya: this is owing to the steepness and dryness of the latter\r\nlocality, where there is an absence of dense forest, which is replaced\r\nby a number of social grasses clothing the mountain sides, many new and\r\nbeautiful kinds of rhododendrons, and a variety of European\r\ngenera,[143] which (as I have elsewhere noticed) are either wholly\r\nabsent from the damper ranges of Dorjiling, or found there several\r\nthousand feet higher up. On the hill above Choongtam village, I\r\ngathered, at 5000 to 6000 feet, _Rhododendron arboreum_ and\r\n_Dalhousiæ,_ which do not generally grow at Dorjiling below 7,500\r\nfeet.[144] The yew appears at 7000 feet, whilst, on the outer ranges\r\n(as on Tonglo), it is only found at 9,500 to 10,000 feet; and whereas\r\non Tonglo it forms an immense tall tree, with long sparse branches and\r\nslender drooping twigs, growing amongst gigantic magnolias and oaks, at\r\nChoongtam it is small and rigid, and much resembling in appearance our\r\nchurchyard yew.[145] At 8000 feet the _Abies Brunoniana_ is found; a\r\ntree quite unknown further south; but neither the larch nor the _Albies\r\nSmithiana_ (Khutrow) accompanied it, they being confined to still more\r\nnorthern regions.\r\n\r\n [143] _Deutzia, Saxifraga caliata, Thalictrum, Euphorbia,_ yellow\r\n violet, _Labiatæ, Androsace, Leguminosæ, Coriaria, Delphinium,_\r\n currant, _Umbelliferæ,_ primrose, _Anemone, Convallaria, Roscœa,\r\n Mitella, Herminium, Drosera._\r\n\r\n\r\n [144] I collected here ten kinds of rhododendron, which, however, are\r\n not the social plants that they become at greater elevations. Still,\r\n in the delicacy and beauty of their flowers, four of them, perhaps,\r\n excel any others; they are, _R. Aucklandii,_ whose flowers are five\r\n inches and a half in diameter; _R. Maddeni, R. Dalhousiæ,_ and _R.\r\n Edgeworthii,_ all white-flowered bushes, of which the two first rise\r\n to the height of small trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n [145] The yew spreads east from Kashmir to the Assam Himalaya and the\r\n Khasia mountains; and the Japan, Philippine Island, Mexican, and other\r\n North American yews, belong to the same widely-diffused species. In\r\n the Khasia (its most southern limit) it is found as low as 5000 feet\r\n above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seldom had occasion to allude to snakes, which are rare and shy\r\nin most parts of the Himalaya; I, however, found an extremely venomous\r\none at Choongtam; a small black viper, a variety of the cobra di\r\ncapello,[146] which it replaces in the drier grassy parts of the\r\ninterior of Sikkim, the large cobra not inhabiting in the mountain\r\nregions. Altogether I only collected about twelve species in Sikkim,\r\nseven of which are venomous, and all are dreaded by the Lepchas. An\r\nenormous hornet (_Vespa magnifica,_ Sm.), nearly two inches long, was\r\nhere brought to me alive in a cleft-stick, lolling out its great\r\nthorn-like sting, from which drops of a milky poison distilled: its\r\nsting is said to produce fatal fevers in men and cattle, which may very\r\nwell be the case, judging from that of a smaller kind, which left great\r\npain in my hand for two days, while a feeling of numbness remained in\r\nthe arm for several weeks. It is called Vok by the Lepchas, a common\r\nname for any bee: its larvæ are said to be greedily eaten, as are those\r\nof various allied insects.\r\n\r\n [146] Dr. Gray, to whom I am indebted for the following information,\r\n assures me that this reptile is not specifically distinct from the\r\n common Cobra of India; though all the mountain specimens of it which\r\n he has examined retain the same small size and dark colour. Of the\r\n other Sikkim reptiles which I procured seven are _Colubridæ_ and\r\n innocuous; five _Crotalidæ_ are venomous, three of which are new\r\n species belonging to the genera _Parias_ and _Trimesurus._ Lizards are\r\n not abundant, but I found at Choongtam a highly curious one,\r\n _Plestiodon Sikkimensis,_ Gray; a kind of Skink, whose only allies are\r\n two North American congeners; and a species of _Agama_ (a\r\n chameleon-like lizard) which in many important points more resembled\r\n an allied American genus than an Asiatic one. The common immense\r\n earth-worm of Sikkim, _Ichthyophis glutinosus,_ is a native of the\r\n Khasia mountains, Singapore, Ceylon and Java. It is a most remarkable\r\n fact, that whereas seven out of the twelve Sikkim snakes are\r\n poisonous, the sixteen species I procured in the Khasia mountains are\r\n innocuous.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoongtam boasts a profusion of beautiful insects, amongst which the\r\nBritish swallow-tail butterfly (_Papilio Machaon_) disports itself in\r\ncompany with magnificent black, gold, and scarlet-winged butterflies,\r\nof the Trojan group, so typical of the Indian tropics. At night my tent\r\nwas filled with small water-beetles (_Berosi_) that quickly put out the\r\ncandle; and with lovely moths came huge cockchafers (_Encerris\r\nGriffithii_), and enormous and fœtid flying-bugs (of the genus\r\n_Derecterix_), which bear great horns on the thorax. The irritation of\r\nmosquito and midge bites, and the disgusting insects that clung with\r\nspiny legs to the blankets of my tent and bed, were often as effectual\r\nin banishing sleep, as were my anxious thoughts regarding the future.\r\n\r\nThe temple at Choongtam is a poor wooden building, but contains some\r\ninteresting drawings of Lhassa, with its extensive Lamaseries and\r\ntemples; they convey the idea of a town, gleaming, like Moscow, with\r\ngilded and copper roofs; but on a nearer aspect it is found to consist\r\nof a mass of stone houses, and large religious edifices many stories\r\nhigh, the walls of which are regularly pierced with small square\r\nornamented windows.[147]\r\n\r\n [147] MM. Huc and Gabet’s account of Lhassa is, I do not doubt,\r\n excellent as to particulars; but the trees which they describe as\r\n magnificent, and girdling the city, have uniformly been represented to\r\n me as poor stunted willows, apricots, poplars, and walnuts, confined\r\n to the gardens of the rich. No doubt the impression left by these\r\n objects on the minds of travellers from tree-less Tartary, and of\r\n Sikkimites reared amidst stupendous forests, must be widely different.\r\n The information concerning Lhassa collected by Timkowski, “Travels of\r\n the Russian Mission to China” (in 1821) is greatly exaggerated, though\r\n containing much that is true and curious. The dyke to protect the city\r\n from inundations I never heard of; but there is a current story in\r\n Sikkim that Lhassa is built in a lake-bed, which was dried up by a\r\n miracle of the Lamas, and that in heavy rain the earth trembles, and\r\n the waters bubble through the soil: a Dorjiling rain-fall, I have been\r\n assured, would wash away the whole city. Ermann (Travels in Siberia,\r\n i., p. 186), mentions a town (Klinchi, near Perm), thus built over\r\n subterraneous springs, and in constant danger of being washed away.\r\n MM. Huc and Gabet allude to the same tradition under another form.\r\n They say that the natives of the banks of the Koko-nor affirm that the\r\n waters of that lake once occupied a subterranean position beneath\r\n Lhassa, and that the waters sapped the foundations of the temples as\r\n soon as they were built, till withdrawn by supernatural agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing remarkable in the geology of Choongtam: the base of\r\nthe hill consists of the clay and mica slates overlain by gneiss,\r\ngenerally dipping to the eastward; in the latter are granite veins,\r\ncontaining fine tourmalines. Actinolites are found in some highly\r\nmetamorphic gneisses, brought by landslips from the neighbouring\r\nheights. The weather in May was cloudy and showery, but the rain which\r\nfell was far less in amount than that at Dorjiling: during the day the\r\nsun’s power was great; but though it rose between five and six a.m., it\r\nnever appeared above the lofty peaked mountains that girdle the valley\r\ntill eight a.m. Dark pines crest the heights around, and landslips\r\nscore their flanks with white seams below; while streaks of snow remain\r\nthroughout the month at 9000 feet above; and everywhere silvery\r\ntorrents leap down to the Lachen and Lachoong.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Juniperus recurva]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\nRoutes from Choongtam to Tibet frontier—Choice of that by the Lachen\r\nriver—Arrival of Supplies—Departure—Features of the valley—Eatable\r\n_Polygonum_—Tumlong—Cross Taktoong river—Pines, larches, and other\r\ntrees—Chateng pool—Water-plants and insects—Tukcham mountain—Lamteng\r\nvillage—Inhabitants—Alpine monkey—Botany of temperate Himalaya—European\r\nand American fauna—Japanese and Malayan genera—Superstitious objections\r\nto shooting—Customs of people—Rain—Run short of provisions—Altered\r\nposition of Tibet frontier—Zemu Samdong—Imposition—Vegetation—Uses of\r\npines—Ascent to Thlonok river—Balanophora wood for making\r\ncups—Snow-beds—Eatable mushrooms and _Smilacina_—Asarabacca—View of\r\nKinchinjunga—Arum-roots, preparation of for food—Liklo\r\nmountain—Bebaviour of my party—Bridge constructed over Zemu—Cross\r\nriver—Alarm of my party—Camp on Zemu river.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this place there were two routes to Tibet, each of about six days’\r\njourney. One lay to the north-west up the Lachen valley to the Kongra\r\nLama pass, the other to the east up the Lachoong to the Donkia pass.\r\nThe latter river has its source in small lakes in Sikkim, south of the\r\nDonkia mountain, a shoulder of which the pass crosses, commanding a\r\nmagnificent view into Tibet. The Lachen, on the other hand (the\r\nprincipal source of the Teesta), rises beyond Sikkim in the Cholamoo\r\nlakes. The frontier at Kongra Lama was described to me as being a\r\npolitical, and not a natural boundary, marked out by cairns, standing\r\non a plain, and crossing the Lachen river. To both Donkia and Kongra\r\nLama I had every right to go, and was determined, if possible, to reach\r\nthem, in spite of Meepo’s ignorance, our guide’s endeavours to frighten\r\nmy party and mislead myself, and the country people’s dread of\r\nincurring the Dewan’s displeasure.\r\n\r\nThe Lachen valley being pronounced impracticable in the height of the\r\nrains, a month later, it behoved me to attempt it first, and it\r\npossessed the attraction of leading to a frontier described as far to\r\nthe northward of the snowy Himalaya, on a lofty plateau, whose plants\r\nand animals were different from anything I had previously seen.\r\n\r\nAfter a week the coolies arrived with supplies: they had been delayed\r\nby the state of the paths, and had consequently consumed a great part\r\nof my stock, reducing it to eight days’ allowance. I therefore divided\r\nmy party, leaving the greater number at Choongtam, with a small tent,\r\nand instructions to forward all food to me as it arrived. I started\r\nwith about fifteen attendants, on the 25th of May, for Lamteng, three\r\nmarches up the Lachen.\r\n\r\nDescending the step-formed terraces, I crossed the Lachen by a good\r\ncane bridge. The river is a headstrong torrent, and turbid from the\r\nvast amount of earthy matter which it bears along; and this character\r\nof extreme impetuosity, unbroken by any still bend, or even swirling\r\npool, it maintains uninterruptedly at this season from 4000 to 10,000\r\nfeet. It is crossed three times, always by cane bridges, and I cannot\r\nconceive any valley of its nature to be more impracticable at such a\r\nseason. On both sides the mountains rose, densely forest-clad, at an\r\naverage angle of 35° to 40°, to 10,000 and 15,000 feet. Its extreme\r\nnarrowness, and the grandeur of its scenery, were alike recalled to my\r\nmind, on visiting the Sachs valley in the Valais of Switzerland; from\r\nwhich, however, it differs in its luxuriant forest, and in the slopes\r\nbeing more uniform and less broken up into those imposing precipices so\r\nfrequent in Switzerland, but which are wanting in the temperate regions\r\nof the Sikkim Himalaya.\r\n\r\nAt times we scrambled over rocks 1000 feet above the river, or\r\ndescended into gorges, through whose tributary torrents we waded, or\r\ncrossed swampy terraced flats of unstratified shingle above the stream;\r\nwhilst it was sometimes necessary to round rocky promontories in the\r\nriver, stemming the foaming torrent that pressed heavily against the\r\nchest as, one by one, we were dragged along by powerful Lepchas. Our\r\nhalting-places were on flats close to the river, covered with large\r\ntrees, and carpeted with a most luxuriant herbage, amongst which a wild\r\nbuckwheat (_Polygonum_[148]) was abundant, which formed an excellent\r\nspinach: it is called “Pullop-bi”; a name I shall hereafter have\r\noccasion to mention with gratitude.\r\n\r\n [148] _Polygonum cymosum,_ Wall. This is a common Himalayan plant, and\r\n is also found in the Khasia mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few miles above Choongtam, we passed a few cottages on a very\r\nextensive terrace at Tumlong; but between this and Lamteng, the country\r\nis uninhabited, nor is it frequented during the rains. We consequently\r\nfound that the roads had suffered, the little bridges and aids to climb\r\nprecipices and cross landslips had been carried away, and at one place\r\nwe were all but turned back. This was at the Taktoong river, a\r\ntributary on the east bank, which rushes down at an angle of 15°, in a\r\nsheet of silvery foam, eighteen yards broad. It does not, where I\r\ncrossed it, flow in a deep gulley, having apparently raised its bed by\r\nan accumulation of enormous boulders; and a plank bridge was thrown\r\nacross it, against whose slippery and narrow foot-boards the water\r\ndashed, loosening the supports on either bank, and rushing between\r\ntheir foundation stones.\r\n\r\nMy unwilling guide had gone ahead with some of the coolies: I had\r\nsuspected him all along (perhaps unjustly) of avoiding the most\r\npracticable routes; but when I found him waiting for me at this bridge,\r\nto which he sarcastically pointed with his bow, I felt that had he\r\nknown of it, to have made difficulties before would have been a work of\r\nsupererogation. He seemed to think I should certainly turn back, and\r\nassured me there was no other crossing (a statement I afterwards found\r\nto be untrue); so, comforting myself with the hope that if the danger\r\nwere imminent, Meepo would forcibly stop me, I took off my shoes, and\r\nwalked steadily over: the tremor of the planks was like that felt when\r\nstanding on the paddle-box of a steamer, and I was jerked up and down,\r\nas my weight pressed them into the boiling flood, which shrouded me\r\nwith spray. I looked neither to the right nor to the left, lest the\r\nmotion of the swift waters should turn my head, but kept my eye on the\r\nwhite jets d’eau springing up between the woodwork, and felt thankful\r\nwhen fairly on the opposite bank: my loaded coolies followed, crossing\r\none by one without fear or hesitation. The bridge was swept into the\r\nLachen very shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nTowards Lamteng, the path left the river, and passed through a wood of\r\n_Abies Smithiana._[149] Larch appears at 9000 feet, with _Abies\r\nBrunoniana._ An austere crab-apple, walnut, and the willow of Babylon\r\n(the two latter perhaps cultivated), yellow jessamine and ash, all\r\nscarce trees in Sikkim, are more or less abundant in the valley, from\r\n7000 to 8000 feet; as is an ivy, very like the English, but with fewer\r\nand smaller yellow or reddish berries; and many other plants,[150] not\r\nfound at equal elevations on the outer ranges of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n [149] Also called _A. Khutrow_ and _Morinda._ I had not before seen\r\n this tree in the Himalaya: it is a spruce fir, much resembling the\r\n Norway spruce in general appearance, but with longer pendulous\r\n branches. The wood is white, and considered indifferent, though\r\n readily cleft into planks; it is called “Seh.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [150] Wood-sorrel, a white-stemmed bramble, birch, some maples, nut\r\n gigantic lily (_Lilium giganteum_), _Euphorbia, Pedicularis, Spiræa,\r\n Philadelphus, Deutzia, Indigofera,_ and various other South Europe and\r\n North American genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nChateng, a spur from the lofty peak of Tukcham,[151] 19,472 feet high,\r\nrises 1000 feet above the west bank of the river; and where crossed,\r\ncommands one of the finest alpine views in Sikkim. It was grassy,\r\nstrewed with huge boulders of gneiss, and adorned with clumps of\r\npark-like pines: on the summit was a small pool, beautifully fringed\r\nwith bushy trees of white rose, a white-blossomed apple, a _Pyrus_ like\r\n_Aria,_ another like mountain-ash, scarlet rhododendrons (_arboreum_\r\nand _barbatum_), holly, maples, and _Goughia,_[152] a curious evergreen\r\nlaurel-like tree: there were also Daphnes, purple magnolia, and a pink\r\nsweet-blossomed _Sphærostema._ Many English water-plants[153] grew in\r\nthe water, but I found no shells; tadpoles, however, swarmed, which\r\nlater in the season become large frogs. The “painted-lady” butterfly\r\n(_Cynthia Cardui_), and a pretty “blue” were flitting over the flowers,\r\ntogether with some great tropical kinds, that wander so far up these\r\nvalleys, accompanying _Marlea,_ the only subtropical tree that ascends\r\nto 8,500 feet in the interior of Sikkim.\r\n\r\n [151] “Tuk” signifies head in Lepcha, and “cheam” or “chaum,” I\r\n believe, has reference to the snow. The height of Tukcham has been\r\n re-calculated by Capt. R. Strachey, with angles taken by myself, at\r\n Dorjiling and Jillapahar, and is approximate only.\r\n\r\n\r\n [152] This fine plant was named (Wight, “Ic. Plant.”) in honour of\r\n Capt. Gough, son of the late commander-in-chief, and an officer to\r\n whom the botany of the peninsula of India is greatly indebted. It is a\r\n large and handsome evergreen, very similar in foliage to a fine\r\n rhododendron, and would prove an invaluable ornament on our lawns, if\r\n its hardier varieties were introduced into this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n [153] _Sparganium, Typha, Potamogeton, Callitriche, Utricularia,_\r\n sedges and rushes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river runs close tinder the eastern side of the valley, which\r\nslopes so steeply as to appear for many miles almost a continuous\r\nlandslip, 2000 feet high.\r\n\r\nLamteng village, where I arrived on the 27th of May, is quite concealed\r\nby a moraine to the south, which, with a parallel ridge on the north,\r\nforms a beautiful bay in the mountains, 8,900 feet above the sea, and\r\n1000 above the Lachen. The village stands on a grassy and bushy flat,\r\naround which the pine-clad mountains rise steeply to the snowy peaks\r\nand black cliffs which tower above. It contains about forty houses,\r\nforming the winter-quarters of the inhabitants of the valley, who, in\r\nsummer, move with their flocks and herds to the alpine pastures of the\r\nTibet frontier. The dwellings are like those described at Wallanchoon,\r\nbut the elevation being lower, and the situation more sheltered, they\r\nare more scattered; whilst on account of the dampness of the climate,\r\nthey are raised higher from the ground, and the shingles with which\r\nthey are tiled (made of _Abies Webbiana_) decay in two or three years.\r\nMany are painted lilac, with the gables in diamonds of red, black, and\r\nwhite: the roofs are either of wood, or of the bark of _Abies\r\nBrunoniana,_ held down by large stones: within they are airy and\r\ncomfortable. They are surrounded by a little cultivation of buck-wheat,\r\nradishes, turnips, and mustard. The inhabitants, though paying rent to\r\nthe Sikkim Rajah, consider themselves as Tibetans, and are so in\r\nlanguage, dress, features, and origin: they seldom descend to\r\nChoongtam, but yearly travel to the Tibetan towns of Jigatzi,\r\nKambajong, Giantchi, and even to Lhassa, having always commercial and\r\npastoral transactions with the Tibetans, whose flocks are pastured on\r\nthe Sikkim mountains during summer, and who trade with the plains of\r\nIndia through the medium of these villagers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamteng village]\r\n\r\nThe snow having disappeared from elevations below 11,000 feet, the\r\nyaks, sheep, and ponies had just been driven 2000 feet up the valley,\r\nand the inhabitants were preparing to follow, with their tents and\r\ngoats, to summer quarters at Tallum and Tungu. Many had goîtres and\r\nrheumatism, for the cure of which they flocked to my tent; dry-rubbing\r\nfor the latter, and tincture of iodine for the former, gained me some\r\ncredit as a doctor: I could, however, procure no food beyond trifling\r\npresents of eggs, meal, and more rarely, fowls.\r\n\r\nOn arriving, I saw a troop of large monkeys[154] gambolling in a wood\r\nof _Abies Brunoniana_: this surprised me, as I was not prepared to find\r\nso tropical an animal associated with a vegetation typical of a boreal\r\nclimate. The only other quadrupeds seen here were some small earless\r\nrats, and musk-deer; the young female of which latter sometimes\r\nafforded me a dish of excellent venison; being, though dark-coloured\r\nand lean, tender, sweet, and short-fibred. Birds were scarce, with the\r\nexception of alpine pigeons (_Columba leuconota_), red-legged crows\r\n(_Corvus graculus,_ L.), and the horned pheasant (_Meleagris Satyra,_\r\nL.). In this month insects are scarce, _Elater_ and a black earwig\r\nbeing the most frequent: two species of _Serica_ also flew into my\r\ntent, and at night moths, closely resembling European ones, came from\r\nthe fir-woods. The vegetation in the, neighbourhood of Lamteng is\r\nEuropean and North American; that is to say, it unites the boreal and\r\ntemperate floras of the east and west hemispheres; presenting also a\r\nfew features peculiar to Asia. This is a subject of very great\r\nimportance in physical geography; as a country combining the botanical\r\ncharacters of several others, affords materials for tracing the\r\ndirection in which genera and species have migrated, the causes that\r\nfavour their migrations, and the laws that determine the types or forms\r\nof one region, which represent those of another. A glance at the map\r\nwill show that Sikkim is, geographically, peculiarly well situated for\r\ninvestigations of this kind, being centrically placed, whether as\r\nregards south-eastern Asia or the Himalayan chain. Again, the Lachen\r\nvalley at this spot is nearly equi-distant from the tropical forests of\r\nthe Terai and the sterile mountains of Tibet, for which reason\r\nrepresentatives both of the dry central Asiatic and Siberian, and of\r\nthe humid Malayan floras meet there.\r\n\r\n [154] _Macacus Pelops?_ Hodgson. This is a very different species from\r\n the tropical kind seen in Nepal, and mentioned at vol. i, p. 278.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of Lamteng (about 50°) is that of the isothermal\r\nwhich passes through Britain in lat. 52°, and east Europe in lat. 48°,\r\ncutting the parallel of 45° in Siberia (due north of Lamteng itself),\r\ndescending to lat. 42° on the east coast of Asia, ascending to lat. 48°\r\non the west of America, and descending to that of New York in the\r\nUnited States. This mean temperature is considerably increased by\r\ndescending to the bed of the Lachen at 8000 feet, and diminished by\r\nascending Tukcham to 14,000 feet, which gives a range of 6000 feet of\r\nelevation, and 20° of mean temperature. But as the climate and\r\nvegetation become arctic at 12,000 feet, it will be as well to confine\r\nmy observations to the flora of 7000 to 10,000 feet; of the mean\r\ntemperature, namely, between 53° and 43°, the isothermal lines\r\ncorresponding to which embrace, on the surface of the globe, at the\r\nlevel of the sea, a space varying in different meridians from three to\r\ntwelve degrees of latitude.[155] At first sight it appears incredible\r\nthat such a limited area, buried in the depths of the Himalaya, should\r\npresent nearly all the types of the flora of the north temperate zone;\r\nnot only, however, is this the case, but space is also found at Lamteng\r\nfor the intercalation of types of a Malayan flora, otherwise wholly\r\nforeign to the north temperate region.\r\n\r\n [155] On the west coast of Europe, where the distance between these\r\n isothermal lines is greatest, this belt extends almost from Stockholm\r\n and the Shetlands to Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few examples will show this. Amongst trees the Conifers are\r\nconspicuous at Lamteng, and all are of genera typical both of Europe\r\nand North America: namely, silver fir, spruce, larch, and juniper,\r\nbesides the yew: there are also species of birch, alder, ash, apple,\r\noak, willow, cherry, bird-cherry, mountain-ash, thorn, walnut, hazel,\r\nmaple, poplar, ivy, holly, Andromeda, _Rhamnus._ Of bushes; rose,\r\nberberry, bramble, rhododendron, elder, cornel, willow, honeysuckle,\r\ncurrant, _Spiræa, Viburnum, Cotoneaster, Hippophæ._ Herbaceous\r\nplants[156] are far too numerous to be enumerated, as a list would\r\ninclude most of the common genera of European and North American\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n [156] As an example, the ground about my tent was covered with grasses\r\n and sedges, amongst which grew primroses, thistles, speedwell, wild\r\n leeks, _Arum, Convallaria, Callitriche, Oxalis, Ranunculus,\r\n Potentilla, Orchis, Chærophyllum, Galium, Paris,_ and _Anagallis_;\r\n besides cultivated weeds of shepherd’s-purse, dock, mustard,\r\n Mithridate cress, radish, turnip, _Thlaspi arvense,_ and _Poa annua._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf North American genera, not found in Europe, were _Buddleia,\r\nPodophyllum, Magnolia, Sassafras? Tetranthera, Hydrangea, Diclytra,\r\nAralia, Panax, Symplocos, Trillium,_ and _Clintonia._ The absence of\r\nheaths is also equally a feature in the flora of North America. Of\r\nEuropean genera, not found in North America, the Lachen valley has\r\n_Coriaria, Hypecoum,_ and various _Cruciferæ._ The Japanese and Chinese\r\nfloras are represented in Sikkim by _Camellia, Deutzia, Stachyurus,\r\nAucuba, Helwingia, Stauntonia, Hydrangea, Skimmia, Eurya, Anthogonium,_\r\nand _Enkianthus._ The Malayan by Magnolias, _Talauma,_ many vacciniums\r\nand rhododendrons, _Kadsura, Goughia, Marlea,_ both coriaceous and\r\ndeciduous-leaved _Cælogyne, Oberonia, Cyrtosia, Calanthe,_ and other\r\norchids; _Ceropegia, Parochetus, Balanophora,_ and many _Scitamineæ_;\r\nand amongst trees, by _Engelhardtia, Goughia,_ and various laurels.\r\n\r\nShortly after my arrival at Lamteng, the villagers sent to request that\r\nI would not shoot, as they said it brought on excessive rain,[157] and\r\nconsequent damage to the crops. My necessities did not admit of my\r\ncomplying with their wish unless I could procure food by other means;\r\nand I at first paid no attention to their request. The people, however,\r\nbecame urgent, and the Choongtam Lama giving his high authority to the\r\nsuperstition, it appeared impolitic to resist their earnest\r\nsupplication; though I was well aware that the story was trumped up by\r\nthe Lama for the purpose of forcing me to return. I yielded on the\r\npromise of provisions being supplied from the village, which was done\r\nto a limited extent; and I was enabled to hold out till more arrived\r\nfrom Dorjiling, now, owing to the state of the roads, at the distance\r\nof twenty days’ march. The people were always civil and kind: there was\r\nno concealing the fact that the orders were stringent, prohibiting my\r\nparty being supplied with food, but many of the villagers sought\r\nopportunities by night of replenishing my stores. Superstitious and\r\ntimorous, they regard a doctor with great veneration; and when to that\r\nis added his power of writing, drawing, and painting, their admiration\r\nknows no bounds: they flocked round my tent all day, scratching their\r\nears, lolling out their tongues, making a clucking noise, smiling, and\r\ntimidly peeping over my shoulder, but flying in alarm when my little\r\ndog resented their familiarity by snapping at their legs. The men spend\r\nthe whole day in loitering about, smoking and spinning wool: the women\r\nin active duties; a few were engaged in drying the leaves of a shrub\r\n(_Symplocos_) for the Tibet market, which are used as a yellow dye;\r\nwhilst, occasionally, a man might be seen cutting a spoon or a\r\nyak-saddle out of rhododendron wood.\r\n\r\n [157] In Griffith’s narrative of “Pemberton’s Mission to Bhotan”\r\n (“Posthumous Papers, Journal,” p. 283), it is mentioned that the\r\n Gylongs (Lamas) attributed a violent storm to the members of the\r\n mission shooting birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Lamteng, the weather was all but uniformly cloudy and\r\nmisty, with drizzling rain, and a southerly, or up-valley wind, during\r\nthe day, which changed to an easterly one at night: occasionally\r\ndistant thunder was heard. My rain-gauges showed very little rain\r\ncompared with what fell at Dorjiling during the same period; the clouds\r\nwere thin, both sun and moon shining through them, without, however,\r\nthe former warming the soil: hence my tent was constantly wet, nor did\r\nI once sleep in a dry bed till the 1st of June, which ushered in the\r\nmonth with a brilliant sunny day. At night it generally rained in\r\ntorrents, and the roar of landslips and avalanches was then all but\r\nuninterrupted for hour after hour: sometimes it was a rumble, at others\r\na harsh grating sound, and often accompanied with the crashing of\r\nimmense timber-trees, or the murmur of the distant snowy avalanches.\r\nThe amount of denudation by atmospheric causes is here quite\r\nincalculable; and I feel satisfied that the violence of the river at\r\nthis particular part of its course (where it traverses those parts of\r\nthe valleys which are most snowy and rainy), is proximately due to\r\nimpediments thus accumulated in its bed.\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes clear at sunrise, and I made many ascents of Tukcham,\r\nhoping for a view of the mountains towards the passes; but I was only\r\nsuccessful on one occasion, when I saw the table top of Kinchinjhow,\r\nthe most remarkable, and one of the most distant peaks of dazzling snow\r\nwhich is seen from Dorjiling, and which, I was told, is far beyond\r\nSikkim, in Tibet.[158] I kept up a constant intercourse with Choongtam,\r\nsending my plants thither to be dried, and gradually reducing my party\r\nas our necessities urged my so doing; lastly, I sent back the shooters,\r\nwho had procured very little, and whose occupation was now gone.\r\n\r\n [158] Such, however, is not the case; Kinchinjhow is on the frontier\r\n of Sikkim, though a considerable distance behind the most snowy of the\r\n Sikkim mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of June, I received the bad news that a large party of\r\ncoolies had been sent from Dorjiling with rice, but that being unable\r\nor afraid to pass the landslips, they had returned: we had now no food\r\nexcept a kid, a few handfuls of flour, and some potatos, which had been\r\nsent up from Choongtam. All my endeavours to gain information\r\nrespecting the distance and position of the frontier were unavailing;\r\nprobably, indeed, the Lama and Phipun (or chief man of the village),\r\nwere the only persons who knew; the villagers calling all the lofty\r\npastures a few marches beyond Lamteng “Bhote” or “Cheen” (Tibet). Dr.\r\nCampbell had procured for me information by which I might recognise the\r\nfrontier were I once on it; but no description could enable me to find\r\nmy way in a country so rugged and forest-clad, through tortuous and\r\nperpetually forking valleys, along often obliterated paths, and under\r\ncloud and rain. To these difficulties must be added the deception of\r\nthe rulers, and the fact (of which I was not then aware), that the\r\nTibet frontier was formerly at Choongtam; but from the Lepchas\r\nconstantly harassing the Tibetans, the latter, after the establishment\r\nof the Chinese rule over their country, retreated first to Zemu\r\nSamdong, a few hours walk above Lamteng, then to Tallum Samdong, 2000\r\nfeet higher; and, lastly, to Kongra Lama, 16,000 feet up the west flank\r\nof Kinchinjhow.\r\n\r\nOn the third of June I took a small party, with my tent, and such\r\nprovisions as I had, to explore up the river. On hearing of my\r\nintention, the Phipun volunteered to take me to the frontier, which he\r\nsaid was only two hours distant, at Zemu Samdong, where the Lachen\r\nreceives the Zemu river from the westward: this I knew must be false,\r\nbut I accepted his services, and we started, accompanied by a large\r\nbody of villagers, who eagerly gathered plants for me along the road.\r\n\r\nThe scenery is very pretty; the path crosses extensive and dangerous\r\nlandslips, or runs through fine woods of spruce and _Abies Brunoniana,_\r\nand afterwards along the river-banks, which are fringed with willow\r\n(called “Lama”), and _Hippophæ._ The great red rose (_Rosa\r\nmacrophylla_), one of the most beautiful Himalayan plants, whose single\r\nflowers are as large as the palm of the hand, was blossoming, while\r\ngolden _Potentillas_ and purple primroses flowered by the stream, and\r\n_Pyrola_ in the fir-woods.\r\n\r\nJust above the fork of the valley, a wooden bridge (Samdong) crosses\r\nthe Zemu, which was pointed out to me as the frontier, and I was\r\nentreated to respect two sticks and a piece of worsted stretched across\r\nit; this I thought too ridiculous, so as my followers halted on one\r\nside, I went on the bridge, threw the sticks into the stream, crossed,\r\nand asked the Phipun to follow; the people laughed, and came over: he\r\nthen told me that he had authority to permit of my botanising there,\r\nbut that I was in Cheen, and that he would show me the guard-house to\r\nprove the truth of his statement. He accordingly led me up a steep bank\r\nto an extensive broad flat, several hundred feet above the river, and\r\nforming a triangular base to the great spur which, rising steeply\r\nbehind, divides the valley. This flat was marshy and covered with\r\ngrass; and buried in the jungle were several ruined stone houses, with\r\nthick walls pierced with loopholes: these had no doubt been occupied by\r\nTibetans at the time when this was the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe elevation which I had attained (that of the river being 8,970 feet)\r\nbeing excellent for botanising, I camped; and the villagers, contented\r\nwith the supposed success of their strategy, returned to Lamteng.\r\n\r\nMy guide from the Durbar had staid behind at Lainteng, and though Meepo\r\nand all my men well knew that this was not the frontier, they were\r\nignorant as to its true position, nor could we even ascertain which of\r\nthe rivers was the Lachen.[159] The only routes I possessed indicated\r\ntwo paths northwards from Lamteng, neither crossing a river: and I\r\ntherefore thought it best to remain at Zemu Samdong till provisions\r\nshould arrive. I accordingly halted for three days, collecting many new\r\nand beautiful plants, and exploring the roads, of which five (paths or\r\nyak-tracks) diverged from this point, one on either bank of each river,\r\nand one leading up the fork.\r\n\r\n [159] The eastern afterwards proved to be the Lachen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I ascended the steep hill at the fork; it was dry and\r\nrocky, and crowned with stunted pines. Stacks of different sorts of\r\npine-wood were stored on the flat at its base, for export to Tibet, all\r\nthatched with the bark of _Abies Brunoniana._ Of these the larch\r\n(_Larix Griffithii,_ “Sah”), splits well, and is the most durable of\r\nany; but the planks are small, soft, and white.[160] The silver fir\r\n(_Abies Webbiana,_ “Dunshing”) also splits well; it is white, soft, and\r\nhighly prized for durability. The wood of _Abies Brunoniana_\r\n(“Semadoong”) is like the others in appearance, but is not durable; its\r\nbark is however very useful. The spruce (_Abies Smithiana,_ “Seh”) has\r\nalso white wood, which is employed for posts and beams.[161] These are\r\nthe only pines whose woods are considered very useful; and it is a\r\ncurious circumstance that none produce any quantity of resin,\r\nturpentine, or pitch; which may perhaps be accounted for by the\r\nhumidity of the climate.\r\n\r\n [160] I never saw this wood to be red, close-grained, and hard, like\r\n that of the old Swiss larch; nor does it ever reach so great a size.\r\n\r\n\r\n [161] These woods are all soft and loose in grain, compared with their\r\n European allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pinus longifolia_ (called by the Lepchas “Gniet-koong,” and by the\r\nBhoteeas “Teadong”) only grows in low valleys, where better timber is\r\nabundant. The weeping blue juniper (_Juniperus recurva,_ “Deschoo”),\r\nand the arboreous black one (called “Tchokpo”)[162] yield beautiful\r\nwood, like that of the pencil cedar,[163] but are comparatively scarce,\r\nas is the yew (_Taxus baccata,_ “Tingschi”), whose timber is red. The\r\n“Tchenden,” or funereal cypress, again, is valued only for the odour of\r\nits wood: _Pinus excelsa,_ “Tongschi,” though common in Bhotan, is, as\r\nI have elsewhere remarked, not found in east Nepal or Sikkim; the wood\r\nis admirable, being durable, close-grained, and so resinous as to be\r\nused for flambeaux and candles. On the flat were flowering a beautiful\r\nmagnolia with globular sweet-scented flowers like snow-balls, several\r\nbalsams, with species of _Convallaria, Cotoneaster, Gentian, Spiræa,\r\nEuphorbia, Pedicularis,_ and honeysuckle. On the hill-side were\r\ncreeping brambles, lovely yellow, purple, pink, and white primroses,\r\nwhite-flowered _Thalictrum_ and _Anemone,_ berberry, _Podophyllum,_\r\nwhite rose, fritillary, _Lloydia,_ etc. On the flanks of Tukcham, in\r\nthe bed of a torrent, I gathered many very alpine plants, at the\r\ncomparatively low elevation of 10,000 feet, as dwarf willows,\r\n_Pinguicula,_ (a genus not previously found in the Himalaya), _Oxyria,\r\nAdrosace, Tofieldia, Arenaria,_ saxifrages, and two dwarf heath-like\r\n_Andromedas._[164] The rocks were all of gneiss, with granite veins,\r\ntourmaline, and occasionally pieces of pure plumbago.\r\n\r\n [162] This I have, vol. i. p. 256, referred to the _J. excelsa_ of the\r\n north-west Himalaya, a plant which under various names is found in\r\n many parts of Europe and many parts of Europe and North America; but\r\n since then Dr. Thomson and I have had occasion to compare my Sikkim\r\n conifers with the north-west Himalayan ones and we have found that\r\n this Sikkim species is probably new, and that _J. excelsa_ is not\r\n found east of Nepal.\r\n\r\n\r\n [163] Also a juniper, from Bermuda (_J. Bermudiana_).\r\n\r\n\r\n [164] Besides these, a month later, the following flowered in\r\n profusion: scarlet _Buddleia?_ gigantic lily, yellow jasmine, _Aster,\r\n Potentilla,_ several kinds of orchids, willow-herb (_Epilobium_),\r\n purple _Roscœa, Neillia, Morina,_ many grasses and _Umbelliferæ._\r\n These formed a rank and dense herbaceous, mostly annual vegetation,\r\n six feet high, bound together with _Cuscuta,_ climbing _Leguminosæ,_\r\n and _Ceropegia._ The great summer heat and moisture here favour the\r\n ascent of various tropical genera, of which I found in August several\r\n _Orchideæ_ (_Calanthe, Microstylis,_ and _Cœlogyne_), also _Begonia,\r\n Bryonia, Cynanchum, Aristolochia, Eurya, Procris, Acanthaceæ,_ and\r\n _Cyrtandraseæ._\r\n\r\n\r\nOur guide had remained at Lamteng, on the plea of a sore on his leg\r\nfrom leech-bites: his real object, however, was to stop a party on\r\ntheir way to Tibet with madder and canes, who, had they continued their\r\njourney, would inevitably have pointed out the road to me. The\r\nvillagers themselves now wanted to proceed to the pasturing-grounds on\r\nthe frontier; so the Phipun sent me word that I might proceed as far as\r\nI liked up the east bank of the Zemu. I had explored the path, and\r\nfinding it practicable, and likely to intersect a less frequented route\r\nto the frontier (that crossing the Tekonglah pass from Bah, see p. 13),\r\nI determined to follow it. A supply of food arrived from Dorjiling on\r\nthe 5th of June, reduced, however, to one bag of rice, but with\r\nencouraging letters, and the assurance that more would follow at once.\r\nMy men, of whom I bad eight, behaved admirably, although our diet had\r\nfor five days chiefly consisted of _Polygonum_ (“Pullop-bi”), wild\r\nleeks (“Lagook”), nettles and _Procris_ (an allied, and more succulent\r\nherb), eked out by eight pounds of Tibet meal (“Tsamba”), which I had\r\nbought for ten shillings by stealth from the villagers. What concerned\r\nme most was the destruction of my plants by constant damp, and the want\r\nof sun to dry the papers; which reduced my collections to a tithe of\r\nwhat they would otherwise have been.\r\n\r\nFrom Zemu Samdong the valley runs north-west, for two marches, to the\r\njunction of the Zemu with the Thlonok, which rises on the north-east\r\nflank of Kinchinjunga: at this place I halted for several days, while\r\nbuilding a bridge over the Thlonok. The path runs first through a small\r\nforest of birch, alder, and maple, on the latter of which I found\r\n_Balanophora_[165] growing abundantly: this species produces the great\r\nknots on the maple roots, from which the Tibetans form the cups\r\nmentioned by MM. Huc and Gabet. I was so fortunate as to find a small\r\nstore of these knots, cleaned, and cut ready for the turner, and hidden\r\nbehind a stone by some poor Tibetan, who had never retained to the\r\nspot: they had evidently been there a very long time.\r\n\r\n [165] A curious leafless parasite, mentioned at vol. i, p. 133.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ravines there were enormous accumulations of ice, the result of\r\navalanches; one of them crossed the river, forming a bridge thirty feet\r\nthick, at an elevation of only 9,800 feet above the sea. This\r\nice-bridge was 100 yards broad, and flanked by heaps of boulders, the\r\neffects of combined land and snowslips. These stony places were covered\r\nwith a rich herbage of rhubarb, primroses, _Euphorbia, Sedum,\r\nPolygonum, Convallaria,_ and a purple _Dentaria_ (“Kenroop-bi”) a\r\ncruciferous plant much eaten as a pot-herb. In the pinewoods a large\r\nmushroom (“Onglau,”[166] Tibet.) was abundant, which also forms a\r\nfavourite article of food. Another pot-herb (to which I was afterwards\r\nmore indebted than any) was a beautiful _Smilacina,_ which grows from\r\ntwo to five feet high, and has plaited leaves and crowded panicles of\r\nwhite bell-shaped flowers, like those of its ally the lily of the\r\nvalley, which it also resembles in its mucilaginous properties. It is\r\ncalled “Chokli-bi,”[167] and its young flower-heads, sheathed in tender\r\ngreen leaves, form an excellent vegetable. Nor must I forget to include\r\namongst the eatable plants of this hungry country, young shoots of the\r\nmountain-bamboo, which are good either raw or boiled, and may be\r\nobtained up to 12,000 feet in this valley. A species of _Asarum_\r\n(Asarabacca) grows in the pine-woods; a genus not previously known to\r\nbe Himalayan. The root, like its English medicinal congener, has a\r\nstrong and peculiar smell. At 10,000 feet _Abies Webbiana_ commences,\r\nwith a close undergrowth of a small twiggy holly. This, and the dense\r\nthicket of rhododendron[168] on the banks of the river and edges of the\r\nwood, rendered the march very fatiguing, and swarms of midges kept up a\r\ntormenting irritation.\r\n\r\n [166] _Cortinarius Emodensis_ of the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, who has\r\n named and described it from my specimens and drawings. It is also\r\n called “Yungla tchamo” by the Tibetans, the latter word signifying a\r\n toadstool. Mr. Berkeley informs me that the whole vast genus\r\n _Cortinarius_ scarcely possesses a single other edible species; he\r\n adds that _C. violaceus_ and _violaceo-cinereus_ are eaten in Austria\r\n and Italy, but not always with safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n [167] It is also found on the top of Sinchul, near Dorjiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n [168] Of which I had already gathered thirteen kinds in this valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Zemu continued an impetuous muddy torrent, whose hoarse voice,\r\nmingled with the deep grumbling noise[169] of the boulders rolling\r\nalong its bed, was my lullaby for many nights. Its temperature at Zemu\r\nSamdong was 45° to 46° in June. At its junction with the Thlonok, it\r\ncomes down a steep gulley from the north, foreshortened into a cataract\r\n1000 feet high, and appearing the smaller stream of the two; whilst the\r\nThlonok winds down from the snowy face of Kinchinjunga, which is seen\r\nup the valley, bearing W.S.W., about twenty miles distant. All around\r\nare lofty and rocky mountains, sparingly wooded with pines and larch,\r\nchiefly on their south flanks, which receive the warm, moist, up-valley\r\nwinds; the faces exposed to the north being colder and more barren:\r\nexactly the reverse of what is the case at Choongtam, where the rocky\r\nand sunny south-exposed flanks are the driest.\r\n\r\n [169] The dull rumbling noise thus produced is one of the most\r\n singular phenomena in these mountains, and cannot fail to strike the\r\n observer. At night, especially, the sound seems increased, the reason\r\n of which is not apparent, for in these regions, so wanting in animal\r\n life, the night is no stiller than the day, and the melting of snow\r\n being less, the volume of waters must be somewhat, though not\r\n conspicuously, diminished. The interference of sound by heated\r\n currents of different density is the most obvious cause of the\r\n diminished reverberation during the day, to which Humboldt adds the\r\n increased tension of vapour, and possibly an echo from its particles.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy tent was pitched on a broad terrace, opposite the junction of the\r\nZemu and Thlonok, and 10,850 feet above the sea. It was sheltered by\r\nsome enormous transported blocks of gneiss, fifteen feet high, and\r\nsurrounded by a luxuriant vegetation of most beautiful rhododendrons in\r\nfull flower, willow, white rose, white flowered cherry, thorn, maple\r\nand birch. Some great tuberous-rooted _Arums_[170] were very abundant;\r\nand the ground was covered with small pits, in which were large wooden\r\npestles: these are used in the preparation of food from the arums, to\r\nwhich the miserable inhabitants of the valley have recourse in spring,\r\nwhen their yaks are calving. The roots are bruised with the pestles,\r\nand thrown into these holes with water. Acetous fermentation commences\r\nin seven or eight days, which is a sign that the acrid poisonous\r\nprinciple is dissipated: the pulpy, sour, and fibrous mass is then\r\nboiled and eaten; its nutriment being the starch, which exists in small\r\nquantities, and which they have not the skill to separate by grating\r\nand washing. This preparation only keeps a few days, and produces bowel\r\ncomplaints, and loss of the skin and hair, especially when\r\ninsufficiently fermented. Besides this, the “chokli-bi,” and many other\r\nesculents, abounded here; and we had great need of them before leaving\r\nthis wild uninhabited region.\r\n\r\n [170] Two species of _Arisæma,_ called “Tong” by the Tibetans, and\r\n “Sinkree” by the Lepchas.\r\n\r\n\r\nI repeatedly ascended the north flank of Tukcham along a watercourse,\r\nby the side of which were immense slips of rocks and snow-beds; the\r\nmountain-side being excessively steep. Some of the masses of gneiss\r\nthus brought down were dangerously poised on slopes of soft shingle,\r\nand daily moved a little downwards. All the rocks were gneiss and\r\ngranite, with radiating crystals of tourmaline as thick as the thumb.\r\nBelow 12,000 to 13,000 feet the mountain-sides were covered with a\r\ndense scrub of rhododendron bushes, except where broken by rocks,\r\nlandslips, and torrents: above this the winter’s snow lay deep, and\r\nblack rocks and small glaciers, over which avalanches were constantly\r\nfalling with a sullen roar, forbade all attempts to proceed. My object\r\nin ascending was chiefly to obtain views and compass-bearings, in which\r\nI was generally disappointed: once only I had a magnificent prospect of\r\nKinchinjunga, sweeping down in one unbroken mass of glacier and ice,\r\nfully 14,000 feet high, to the head of the Thlonok river, whose upper\r\nvalley appeared a broad bay of ice; doubtless forming one of the\r\nlargest glaciers in the Himalaya, and increased by lateral feeders that\r\nflow into it from either flank of the valley. The south side of this\r\n(the Thlonok) valley is formed by a range from Kinchinjunga, running\r\neast to Tukcham, where it terminates: from it rises the beautiful\r\nmountain Liklo,[171] 22,582 feet high, which, from Dorjiling, appears\r\nas a sharp peak, but is here seen to be a jagged crest running north\r\nand south. On the north flank of the valley the mountains are more\r\nsloping and black, with patches of snow above 15,000 feet, but little\r\nanywhere else, except on another beautiful peak (alt. 19,240 feet)\r\nmarked D3 on the map. This flank is also continuous from Kinchin; it\r\ndivides Sikkim from Tibet, and runs north-east to the great mountain\r\nChomiomo (which was not visible), the streams from its north flank\r\nflowing into the Arun river (in Tibet). A beautiful blue arch of sky\r\nspanned all this range, indicating the dry Tibetan climate beyond.\r\n\r\n [171] D2 of the peaks laid down in Colonel Waugh’s “Trigonometrical\r\n Survey from Dorjiling,” I believe to be the “Liklo” of Dr. Campbell’s\r\n itineraries from Dorjiling to Lhassa, compiled from the information of\r\n the traders (See “Bengal Asiatic Society’s Journal” for 1848); the\r\n routes in which proved of the utmost value to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI made two futile attempts to ascend the Thlonok river to the great\r\nglaciers at the foot of Kinchinjunga, following the south bank, and\r\nhoping to find a crossing-place, and so to proceed north to Tibet. The\r\nfall of the river is not great at this part of its course, nor up to\r\n12,000 feet, which was the greatest height I could attain, and about\r\neight miles beyond my tents; above that point, at the base of Liklo,\r\nthe bed of the valley widens, and the rhododendron shrubbery was quite\r\nimpervious, while the sides of the mountain were inaccessible. We\r\ncrossed extensive snow-beds, by cutting holes in their steep faces, and\r\nrounded rocks in the bed of the torrent, dragging one another through\r\nthe violent current, whose temperature was below 40°.\r\n\r\nOn these occasions, the energy of Meepo, Nimbo (the chief of the\r\ncoolies) and the Lepcha boys, was quite remarkable, and they were as\r\nkeenly anxious to reach the holy country of Tibet as I could possibly\r\nbe. It was sometimes dark before we got back to our tents, tired, with\r\ntorn clothes and cut feet and hands, returning to a miserable dinner of\r\nboiled herbs; but never did any of them complain, or express a wish to\r\nleave me. In the evenings and mornings they were always busy, changing\r\nmy plants, and drying the papers over a sulky fire at my tent-door; and\r\nat night they slept, each wrapt in his own blanket, huddled together\r\nunder a rock, with another blanket thrown over them all. Provisions\r\nreached us so seldom, and so reduced in quantity, that I could never\r\nallow more than one pound of rice to each man in a day, and frequently\r\nduring this trying month they had not even that; and I eked out our\r\nmeagre supply with a few ounces of preserved meats, occasionally\r\n“splicing the main brace” with weak rum and water.\r\n\r\nAt the highest point of the valley which I reached, water boiled at\r\n191·3, indicating an elevation of 11,903 feet. The temperature at 1\r\np.m. was nearly 70°, and of the wet bulb 55°, indicating a dryness of\r\n0·462, and dew point 47·0. Such phenomena of heat and dryness are rare\r\nand transient in the wet valleys of Sikkim, and show the influence here\r\nof the Tibetan climate.[172]\r\n\r\n [172] I gathered here, amongst an abundance of alpine species, all of\r\n European and arctic type, a curious trefoil, the _Parochetus\r\n communis,_ which ranges through 9000 feet of elevation on the\r\n Himalaya, and is also found in Java and Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter boiling my thermometer on these occasions, I generally made a\r\nlittle tea for the party; a refreshment to which they looked forward\r\nwith child-like eagerness. The fairness with which these good-hearted\r\npeople used to divide the scanty allowance, and afterwards the leaves,\r\nwhich are greatly relished, was an engaging trait in their simple\r\ncharacter: I have still vividly before me their sleek swarthy faces and\r\ntwinkling Tartar eyes, as they lay stretched on the ground in the sun,\r\nor crouched in the sleet and snow beneath some sheltering rock; each\r\nwith his little polished wooden cup of tea, watching my notes and\r\ninstruments with curious wonder, asking, “How high are we?” “How cold\r\nis it?” and comparing the results with those of other stations, with\r\nmuch interest and intelligence.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th June, my active people completed a most ingenious bridge of\r\nbranches of trees, bound by withes of willow; by which I crossed to the\r\nnorth bank, where I camped on an immense flat terrace at the junction\r\nof the rivers, and about fifty feet above their bed. The first step or\r\nascent from the river is about five feet high, and formed of water-worn\r\nboulders, pebbles, and sand, scarcely stratified: the second, fully\r\n1000 yards broad, is ten feet high, and swampy. The uppermost is\r\nfifteen feet above the second, and is covered with gigantic boulders,\r\nand vast rotting trunks of fallen pines, buried in an impenetrable\r\njungle of dwarf small-leaved holly and rhododendrons. The surface was\r\ncomposed of a rich vegetable mould, which, where clear of forest,\r\nsupported a rank herbage, six to eight feet high.[173]\r\n\r\n [173] This consisted of grasses, sedges, _Bupleurum,_ rhubarb,\r\n _Ranunculus, Convallaria, Smilacina,_ nettles, thistles, _Arum,_\r\n balsams, and the superb yellow _Meconopsis Nepalensis,_ whose racemes\r\n of golden poppy-like flowers were as broad as the palm of the hand; it\r\n grows three and even six feet high, and resembles a small hollyhock;\r\n whilst a stately _Heracleum,_ ten feet high, towered over all. Forests\r\n of silver fir, with junipers and larch, girdled these flats and on\r\n their edges grew rhododendrons, scarlet _Spiræa,_ several\r\n honeysuckles, white _Clematis,_ and _Viburnum._ Ferns are much scarcer\r\n in the pine-woods than elsewhere in the forest regions of the\r\n Himalaya. In this valley (alt. 10,850 feet), I found only two kinds;\r\n _Hymenophyllum, Lomaria, Cystopteris, Davallia,_ two _Polypodia,_ and\r\n several _Aspidia_ and _Asplenia. Selaginella_ ascends to Zemu Samdong\r\n (9000 feet). The _Pteris aquilina_ (brake) does not ascend above\r\n 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first discovery, after crossing, was of a good bridge across the\r\nZemu, above its junction, and of a path leading down to Zemu Samdong;\r\nthis was, however, scarcely traceable up either stream. My men were\r\nbetter housed here in sheds: and I made several more ineffectual\r\nattempts to ascend the valley to the glaciers. The path, gradually\r\nvanishing, ran alternately through fir-woods, and over open grassy\r\nspots, covered with vegetation, amongst which the gigantic arum was\r\nplentiful, whose roots seemed to be the only attraction in this wet and\r\nmiserable valley.\r\n\r\nOn my return one day, I found my people in great alarm, the Phipun\r\nhaving sent word that we were on the Tibet side of the rivers, and that\r\nTibetan troops were coming to plunder my goods, and carry my men into\r\nslavery. I assured them he only wanted to frighten them; that the Cheen\r\nsoldiers were civil orderly people; and that as long as Meepo was with\r\nus, there was no cause for fear. Fortunately a young musk-deer soon\r\nafterwards broke cover close to the tent, and its flesh wonderfully\r\nrestored their courage: still I was constantly harassed by threats;\r\nsome of my people were suffering from cold and bowel complaints, and I\r\nfrom rheumatism; while one fine lad, who came from Dorjiling, was\r\ndelirious with a violent fever, contracted in the lower valleys, which\r\nsadly dispirited my party.\r\n\r\nHaving been successful in finding a path, I took my tent and a few\r\nactive lads 1000 feet up the Zemu, camping on a high rock above the\r\nforest region, at 12,070 feet; hoping thence to penetrate northwards. I\r\nleft my collections in the interim at the junction of the rivers, where\r\nthe sheds and an abundance of firewood were great advantages for\r\npreserving the specimens. At this elevation we were quite free from\r\nmidges and leeches (the latter had not appeared above 11,500 feet), but\r\nthe weather continued so uniformly rainy and bad, that we could make no\r\nprogress. I repeatedly followed the river for several miles, ascending\r\nto 13,300 feet; but though its valley widened, and its current was less\r\nrapid, the rhododendron thickets below, and the cliffs above, defeated\r\nall endeavours to reach the drier climate beyond, of which I had\r\nabundant evidence in the arch of brilliant blue that spanned the\r\nheavens to the north, beyond a black canopy of clouds that hid\r\neverything around, and poured down rain without one day’s intermission,\r\nduring the eight which I spent here.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Black juniper and young larch]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\nCamp on Zemu river—Scenery—Falling rocks—Tukcham mountain—Height of\r\nglaciers—Botany—Gigantic rhubarb—Insects—Storm—Temperature of\r\nrivers—Behaviour of Lachen Phipun—Hostile conduct of Bhoteeas—View from\r\nmountains above camp—Descend to Zemu Samdong—Vegetation—Letters from\r\nDorjiling—Arrival of Singtam Soubah—Presents from Rajah—Parties\r\ncollecting Arum-roots—Insects—Ascend Lachen river—Thakya-zong—Tallum\r\nSamdong\r\nvillage—Cottages—Mountains—Plants—Entomology—Weather—Halo—Diseases—\r\nConduct of Singtam Soubah—His character and illness—Agrees to take me\r\nto Kongra Lama—Tungu—Appearance of country—Houses—Poisoning by\r\narum-roots—Yaks and calves—Tibet ponies—Journey to Kongra Lama—Tibetan\r\ntents—Butter, curds, and churns—Hospitality—Kinchinjhow and\r\nChomiomo—Magnificent Scenery—Reach Kongra Lama Pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy little tent was pitched in a commanding situation, on a rock fifty\r\nfeet above the Zemu, overlooking the course of that river to its\r\njunction with the Thlonok. The descent of the Zenlu in one thousand\r\nfeet is more precipitous than that of any other river of its size with\r\nwhich I am acquainted in Sikkim, yet immediately above my camp it was\r\nmore tranquil than at any part of its course onwards to the plains of\r\nIndia, whether as the Zemu, Lachen or Teesta. On the west bank a fine\r\nmountain rose in steep ridges and shrubby banks to 15,000 feet; on the\r\neast a rugged cliff towered above the stream, and from this, huge\r\nmasses of rock were ever and anon precipitated into the torrent, with a\r\nroar that repeatedly spread consternation amongst us. During rains\r\nespecially, and at night, when the chilled atmospheric currents of air\r\ndescend, and the sound is not dissipated as in the day-time, the noise\r\nof these falls is sufficiently alarming. My tent was pitched near the\r\nbase of the cliff, and so high above the river, that I had thought it\r\nbeyond the reach of danger; but one morning I found that a large\r\nfragment of granite had been hurled during the night to my very door,\r\nmy dog having had a very narrow escape. To what depth the accumulation\r\nat the base of this cliff may reach, I had no means of judging, but the\r\nrapid slope of the river-bed is mainly due to this, and to old moraines\r\nat the mouth of the valley below. I have seen few finer sights than the\r\nfall of these stupendous blocks into the furious torrent, along which\r\nthey are carried amid feathery foam for many yards before settling to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAcross the Thlonok to the southwards, rose the magnificent mountain of\r\nTukcham, but I only once caught a glimpse of its summit, which even\r\nthen clouded over before I could get my instruments adjusted for\r\nascertaining its height. Its top is a sharp cone, surrounded by rocky\r\nshoulders, that rise from a mass of snow. Its eastern slope of 8000\r\nfeet is very rapid (about 38°) from its base at the Zemu river to its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nGlaciers in the north-west Himalaya descend to 11,000 feet; but I could\r\nnot discover any in these valleys even so low as 14,000 feet, though at\r\nthis season extensive snowbeds remain unmelted at but little above\r\n10,000 feet. The foot of the stupendous glacier filling the broad head\r\nof the Thlonok is certainly not below 14,000 feet; though being\r\ncontinuous with the perpetual snow (or névé) of the summit of\r\nKinchinjunga, it must have 14,000 feet of ice, in perpendicular height,\r\nto urge it forwards.\r\n\r\nAll my attempts to advance up the Zemu were fruitlesss and a snow\r\nbridge by which I had hoped to cross to the opposite bank was carried\r\naway by the daily swelling river, while the continued bad weather\r\nprevented any excursions for days together. Botany was my only\r\nresource, and as vegetation was advancing rapidly under the influence\r\nof the southerly winds, I had a rich harvest: for though _Compositæ,\r\nPedicularis,_ and a few more of the finer Himalayan plants flower\r\nlater, June is still the most glorious month for show.\r\n\r\nRhododendrons occupy the most prominent place, clothing the mountain\r\nslopes with a deep green mantle glowing with bells of brilliant\r\ncolours; of the eight or ten species growing here, every bush was\r\nloaded with as great a profusion of blossoms as are their northern\r\ncongeners in our English gardens. Primroses are next, both in beauty\r\nand abundance; and they are accompanied by yellow cowslips, three feet\r\nhigh, purple polyanthus, and pink large-flowered dwarf kinds nestling\r\nin the rocks, and an exquisitely beautiful blue miniature species,\r\nwhose blossoms sparkle like sapphires on the turf. Gentians begin to\r\nunfold their deep azure bells, aconites to rear their tall blue spikes,\r\nand fritillaries and _Meconopsis_ burst into flower. On the black rocks\r\nthe gigantic rhubarb forms pale pyramidal towers a yard high, of\r\ninflated reflexed bracts, that conceal the flowers, and over-lapping\r\none another like tiles, protect them from the wind and rain: a whorl of\r\nbroad green leaves edged with red spreads on the ground at the base of\r\nthe plant, contrasting in colour with the transparent bracts, which are\r\nyellow, margined with pink. This is the handsomest herbaceous plant in\r\nSikkim: it is called “Tchuka,” and the acid stems are eaten both raw\r\nand boiled; they are hollow and full of pure water: the root resembles\r\nthat of the medicinal rhubarb, but it is spongy and inert; it attains a\r\nlength of four feet, and grows as thick as the arm. The dried leaves\r\nafford a substitute for tobacco; a smaller kind of rhubarb is however\r\nmore commonly used in Tibet for this purpose; it is called “Chula.”\r\n\r\nThe elevation being 12,080 feet, I was above the limit of trees, and\r\nthe ground was covered with many kinds of small-flowered honeysuckles,\r\nberberry, and white rose.[174]\r\n\r\n [174] Besides these I found a prickly _Aralia,_ maple, two currants,\r\n eight or nine rhododendrons, many _Sedums, Rhodiola,_ white\r\n _Clematis,_ red-flowered cherry, birch, willow, _Viburnum,_ juniper, a\r\n few ferns, two _Andromedas, Menziesia,_ and _Spircæa._ And in addition\r\n to the herbs mentioned above, may be enumerated _Parnassia,_ many\r\n Saxifrages, _Soldanella, Draba,_ and various other _Cruciferæ,\r\n Nardostachys,_ (spikenard), _Epilobium, Thalictrum,_ and very many\r\n other genera, almost all typical of the Siberian, North European, and\r\n Arctic floras.\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw no birds, and of animals only an occasional muskdeer. Insects\r\nwere scarce, and quite different from what I had seen before; chiefly\r\nconsisting of _Phryganea_ (Mayfly) and some _Carabidæ_ (an order that\r\nis very scarce in the Himalaya); with various moths, chiefly\r\n_Geometræ._\r\n\r\nThe last days of June (as is often the case) were marked by violent\r\nstorms, and for two days my tent proved no protection; similar weather\r\nprevailed all over India, the barometer falling very low. I took horary\r\nobservations of the barometer in the height of the storm on the 30th:\r\nthe tide was very small indeed (·024 inch, between 9.50 a.m. and 4\r\np.m.), and the thermometer ranged between 47° and 57·8°, between 7 a.m.\r\nand midnight. Snow fell abundantly as low as 13,000 feet, and the\r\nrivers were much swollen, the size and number of the stones they rolled\r\nalong producing a deafening turmoil. Only 3·7 inches of rain fell\r\nbetween the 23rd of June and the 2nd of July; whilst 21 inches fell at\r\nDorjiling, and 6·7 inches at Calcutta. During the same period the mean\r\ntemperature was 48°; extremes, 62°/36.5°. The humidity was nearly at\r\nsaturation-point, the wind southerly, very raw and cold, and drizzling\r\nrain constantly fell. A comparison of thirty observations with\r\nDorjiling gave a difference of 14° temperature, which is at the rate of\r\n1° for every 347 feet of ascent.[175]\r\n\r\n [175] Forty-seven observations, comparative with Calcutta, gave 34·8°\r\n difference, and if 5.5° of temperature be deducted for northing in\r\n latitude, the result is 1° for every 412 feet of ascent. My\r\n observations at the junction of the rivers alt. 10,850 feet), during\r\n the early part of the mouth, gave 1° to 304 feet, as the result of\r\n twenty-four observations with Dorjiling, and 1° to 394 feet, from\r\n seventy-four observations with Calcutta.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe temperature of these rivers varies extremely at different parts of\r\ntheir course, depending on that of their affluents. The Teesta is\r\nalways cool in summer (where its bed is below 2000 feet), its\r\ntemperature being 20° below that of the air; whereas in mid-winter,\r\nwhen there is less cloud, and the snows are not melting, it is only a\r\nfew degrees colder than the air.[176] At this season, in descending\r\nfrom 12,000 feet to 1000 feet, its temperature does not rise 10°,\r\nthough that of the air rises 30° or 40°. It is a curious fact, that the\r\ntemperature of the northern feeders of the Teesta, in some parts of\r\ntheir course, rises with the increasing elevation! Of this the Zemu\r\nafforded a curious example: during my stay at its junction with the\r\nThlonok it was 46°, or 6° warmer than that river; at 1,100 feet higher\r\nit was 48°, and at 1,100 feet higher still it was 49°! These\r\nobservations were repeated in different weeks, and several times on the\r\nsame day, both in ascending and descending, and always with the same\r\nresult: they told, as certainly as if I had followed the river to its\r\nsource, that it rose in a drier and comparatively sunny climate, and\r\nflowed amongst little snowed mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n [176] During my sojourn at Bhomsong in mid-winter of 1848 (see v. i.\r\n p. 305), the mean temperature of the Teesta was 51°, and of the air\r\n 52·3°; at that elevation the river water rarely exceeds 60° at\r\n midsummer. Between 4000 feet and 300 (the plains) its mean temperature\r\n varies about 10° between January and July; at 6000 feet it varies from\r\n 55° to 43° during the same period; and at 10,000 feet it freezes at\r\n the edges in winter and rises to 50° in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Lachen Phipun continued to threaten us, and I had to\r\nsend back some of the more timorous of my party. On the 28th of June\r\nfifty men arrived at the Thlonok, and turned my people out of the shed\r\nat the junction of the rivers, together with the plants they were\r\npreserving, my boards, papers, and utensils. The boys came to me\r\nbreathless, saying that there were Tibetan soldiers amongst them, who\r\ndeclared that I was in Cheen, and that they were coming on the\r\nfollowing morning to make a clean sweep of my goods, and drive me back\r\nto Dorjiling. I had little fear for myself, but was anxious with\r\nrespect to my collections: it was getting late in the day, and raining,\r\nand I had no mind to go down and expose myself to the first brunt of\r\ntheir insolence, which I felt sure a night of such weather would\r\nmaterially wash away. Meepo was too frightened, but Nimbo, my Bhotan\r\ncoolie Sirdar, volunteered to go, with two stout fellows; and he\r\naccordingly brought away my plants and papers, having held a parley\r\nwith the enemy, who, as I suspected, were not Tibetans. The best news\r\nhe brought was, that they were half clad and without food; the worst,\r\nthat they swaggered and bullied: he added, with some pride, that he\r\ngave them as good as he got, which I could readily believe, Nimbo being\r\nreally a resolute fellow,[177] and accomplished in Tibet slang.\r\n\r\n [177] In East Nepal he drew his knife on a Ghorka sepoy; and in the\r\n following winter was bold enough to make his escape in chains from\r\n Tumloong.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning it rained harder than ever, and the wind was\r\npiercingly cold. My timid Lepchas huddled behind my tent, which, from\r\nits position, was only to be stormed in front. I dismantled my little\r\nobservatory, and packed up the instruments, tied my dog, Kinchin, to\r\none of the tent-pegs, placed a line of stones opposite the door, and\r\nseated myself on my bed on the ground, with my gun beside me.\r\n\r\nThe dog gave tongue as twenty or thirty people defiled up the glen, and\r\ngathered in front of my tent; they were ragged Bhoteeas, with bare\r\nheads and legs, in scanty woollen garments sodden with rain, which\r\nstreamed off their shaggy hair, and furrowed their sooty faces: their\r\nwhole appearance recalled to my mind Dugald Dalgetty’s friends, the\r\nchildren of the mist.\r\n\r\nThey appeared nonplussed at seeing no one with me, and at my paying no\r\nattention to them, whilst the valiant Kinchin effectually scared them\r\nfrom the tent-door. When they requested a parley, I sent the\r\ninterpreter to say that I would receive three men, and that only\r\nprovided all the rest were sent down immediately; this, as I\r\nanticipated, was acceded to at once, and there remained only the Lachen\r\nPhipun and his brother. Without waiting to let him speak, I rated him\r\nsoundly, saying, that I was ready to leave the spot when he could\r\nproduce any proof of my being in Bhote (or Cheen), which he knew well I\r\nwas not; that, since my arrival at Lachen, he had told me nothing but\r\nlies, and had contravened every order, both of the Rajah and of Tchebu\r\nLama. I added, that I had given him and his people kindness and\r\nmedicine, their return was bad, and he must go about his business at\r\nonce, having, as I knew, no food, and I having none for him. He behaved\r\nvery humbly throughout, and finally took himself off much discomfited,\r\nand two days afterwards sent men to offer to assist me in moving my\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe first of July was such a day as I had long waited for to obtain a\r\nview, and I ascended the mountain west of my camp, to a point where\r\nwater boiling at 185·7° (air 42°), gave an elevation of 14,914 feet. On\r\nthe top of the range, about 1000 feet above this, there was no snow on\r\nthe eastern exposures, except in hollows, but on the west slopes it lay\r\nin great fields twenty or thirty feet thick; while to the north, the\r\nmountains all appeared destitute of snow, with grassy flanks and rugged\r\ntops.\r\n\r\nDrizzling mist, which had shrouded Tukcham all the morning, soon\r\ngathered on this mountain, and prevented any prospect from the highest\r\npoint reached; but on the ascent I had an excellent view up the Zemu,\r\nwhich opened into a broad grassy valley, where I saw with the glass\r\nsome wooden sheds, but no cattle or people. To reach these, however,\r\ninvolved crossing the river, which was now impossible; and I\r\nreluctantly made up my mind to return on the morrow to Zemu Samdong,\r\nand thence try the other river.\r\n\r\nOn my descent to the Thlonok, I found that the herbaceous plants on the\r\nterraces had grown fully two feet during the fortnight, and now\r\npresented almost a tropical luxuriance and beauty. Thence I reached\r\nZemu Samdong in one day, and found the vegetation there even more gay\r\nand beautiful: the gigantic lily was in full flower, and scenting the\r\nair, with the lovely red rose, called “Chirring” by the Tibetans.\r\n_Neillia_ was blossoming profusely at my old camping-ground, to which I\r\nnow returned after a month’s absence.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival I received letters from Dr. Campbell, who had\r\nstrongly and repeatedly represented to the Rajah his opinion of the\r\ntreatment I was receiving; and this finally brought an explicit answer,\r\nto the effect that his orders had been full and peremptory that I\r\nshould be supplied with provisions, and safely conducted to the\r\nfrontier. With these came letters on the Rajah’s part from Tchebu Lama\r\nto the Lachen Phipun, ordering him to take me to the pass, but not\r\nspecifying its position; fortunately, however, Dr. Campbell sent me a\r\nroute, which stated the pass to be at Kongra Lama, several marches\r\nbeyond this, and in the barren country of Tibet.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July the Singtam Soubah arrived from Chola (the Rajah’s\r\nsummer residence): he was charged to take me to the frontier, and\r\nbrought letters from his highness, as well as a handsome present,\r\nconsisting of Tibet cloth, and a dress of China silk brocaded with\r\ngold: the Ranee also sent me a basket of Lhassa sweetmeats, consisting\r\nof Sultana raisins from Bokhara, sliced and dried apricots from Lhassa,\r\nand _Diospyros_ fruit from China (called “Gubroon” by the Tibetans).\r\nThe Soubah wanted to hurry me on to the frontier and back at once,\r\nbeing no doubt instigated to do so by the Dewan’s party, and by his\r\nhaving no desire to spend much time in the dreary lofty regions I\r\nwanted to explore. I positively refused, however, to start until more\r\nsupplies arrived, except he used his influence to provide me with food;\r\nand as he insisted that the frontier was at Tallum Samdong, only one\r\nmarch up the Lachen, I foresaw that this move was to be but one step\r\nforward, though in the right direction. He went forward to Tallum at\r\nonce, leaving me to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Lamteng people had all migrated beyond that point to Tungu, where\r\nthey were pasturing their cattle: I sent thither for food, and procured\r\na little meal at a very high price, a few fowls and eggs; the messenger\r\nbrought back word that Tungu was in Tibet, and that the villagers\r\nignored Kongra Lama. A large piece of yak-flesh being brought for sale,\r\nI purchased it; but it proved the toughest meat I ever ate, being no\r\ndoubt that of an animal that had succumbed to the arduous duties of a\r\nsalt-carrier over the passes: at this season, however, when the calves\r\nare not a month old, it was in vain to expect better.\r\n\r\nLarge parties of women and children were daily passing my tent from\r\nTungu, to collect arum-roots at the Thlonok, all with baskets at their\r\nbacks, down to rosy urchins of six years old: they returned after\r\nseveral days, their baskets neatly lined with broad rhododendron\r\nleaves, and full of a nauseous-looking yellow acid pulp, which told\r\nforcibly of the extreme poverty of the people. The children were very\r\nfair; indeed the young Tibetan is as fair as an English brunette,\r\nbefore his perennial coat of smoke and dirt has permanently stained his\r\nface, and it has become bronzed and wrinkled by the scorching sun and\r\nrigorous climate of these inhospitable countries. Children and women\r\nwere alike decked with roses, and all were good-humoured and pleasant,\r\nbehaving with great kindness to one another, and unaffected politeness\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nDuring my ten days’ stay at Zemu Samdong, I formed a large collection\r\nof insects, which was in great part destroyed by damp: many were new,\r\nbeautiful, and particularly interesting, from belonging to types whose\r\ngeographical distribution is analogous to that of the vegetation. The\r\ncaterpillar of the swallow-tail butterfly (_Papilio Machaon_), was\r\ncommon, feeding on umbelliferous plants, as in England; and a _Sphynx_\r\n(like _S. Euphorbiæ_) was devouring the euphorbias; the English\r\n_Cynthia Cardui_ (painted-lady butterfly) was common, as were\r\n“sulphurs,” “marbles,” _Pontia_ (whites), “blues,” and _Thecla,_ of\r\nBritish aspect but foreign species. Amongst these, tropical forms were\r\nrare, except one fine black swallow-tail. Of moths, _Noctuæ_ and\r\n_Geometræ_ abounded, with many flies and _Tipulæ. Hymenoptera_ were\r\nscarce, except a yellow _Ophion,_ which lays its eggs in the\r\ncaterpillars above-mentioned. Beetles were most rare, and (what is\r\nremarkable) the wood-borers (_longicorns_ and _Curculio_) particularly\r\nso. A large _Telephora_ was very common, and had the usual propensity\r\nof its congeners for blood; _lamellicorns_ were also abundant.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of July five coolies arrived with rice: they had been\r\ntwenty days on the road, and had been obliged to make great detours,\r\nthe valley being in many places impassable. They brought me a parcel of\r\nEnglish letters; and I started up the Lachen on the following day, with\r\nrenewed spirits and high hopes. The road first crossed the Zemu and the\r\nspur beyond, and then ascended the west bank of the Lachen, a furious\r\ntorrent for five or six miles, during which it descends 1000 feet, in a\r\nchasm from which rise lofty black pine-clad crags, topped by snowy\r\nmountains, 14,000 to 16,000 feet high. One remarkable mass of rock, on\r\nthe east bank, is called “Sakya-zong” (or the abode of Sakya, often\r\npronounced Thakya, one of the Boodhist Trinity); at its base a fine\r\ncascade falls into the river.\r\n\r\nAbove 11,000 feet the valley expands remarkably, the mountains recede,\r\nbecome less wooded, and more grassy, while the stream is suddenly less\r\nrapid, meandering in a broader bed, and bordered by marshes, covered\r\nwith _Carex, Blysmus,_ dwarf Tamarisk, and many kinds of yellow and red\r\n_Pedicularis,_ both tall and beautiful. There are far fewer\r\nrhododendrons here than in the damper Zemu valley at equal elevations,\r\nand more Siberian, or dry country types of vegetation, as _Astragali_\r\nof several kinds, _Habenaria, Epipactis,_ dandelion, and a caraway,\r\nwhose stems (called in Tibet “Gzira”) are much sought for as a\r\ncondiment.[178] The Singtam Soubah and Lachen Phipun received me at the\r\nbridge (Samdong), at Tallum, and led me across the river (into Cheen\r\nthey affirmed) to a pretty green sward, near some gigantic gneiss\r\nboulders, where I camped, close by the river, and 11,480 feet above the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n [178] _Umbelliferæ_ abound here; with sage, _Ranunculus, Anemone,_\r\n Aconites, _Halenia,_ Gentians, _Panax, Euphrasia,_ speedwell,\r\n _Prunella vulgaris,_ thistles, bistort, _Parnassia,_ purple orchis,\r\n _Prenanthes,_ and _Lactuca._ The woody plants of this region are\r\n willows, birch, _Cotoneaster,_ maple, three species of _Viburnum,_\r\n three of _Spiræa, Vaccinium, Aralia, Deutzia, Philadelphus,_\r\n rhododendrons, two junipers, silver fir, larch, three honeysuckles,\r\n _Neillia,_ and a _Pieris,_ whose white blossoms are so full of honey\r\n as to be sweet and palatable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village of Tallum consists of a few wretched stone huts, placed in\r\na broad part of the valley, which is swampy, and crossed by several\r\nancient moraines, which descend from the gulleys on the east\r\nflank.[179] The cottages are from four to six feet high, without\r\nwindows, and consist of a single apartment, containing neither table,\r\nchair, stool, nor bed; the inmates huddle together amid smoke, filth,\r\nand darkness, and sleep on a plank; and their only utensils are a\r\nbamboo churn, copper, bamboo, and earthenware vessels, for milk,\r\nbutter, etc.\r\n\r\n [179] I have elsewhere noticed that in Sikkim, the ancient moraines\r\n above 9000 feet are almost invariably deposited from valleys opening\r\n to the westward.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrassy or stony mountains slope upwards, at an angle of 20°,[180] from\r\nthese flats to 15,000 feet, but no snow is visible, except on\r\nKinchinjhow and Chomiomo, about fifteen miles up the valley. Both these\r\nare flat-topped, and dazzlingly white, rising into small peaks, and\r\nprecipitous on all sides; they are grand, bold, isolated masses, quite\r\nunlike the ordinary snowy mountains in form, and far more imposing even\r\nthan Kinchinjunga, though not above 22,000 feet in elevation.\r\n\r\n [180] At Lamteng and up the Zemu the slopes are 40° and 50°, giving a\r\n widely different aspect to the valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbaceous plants are much more numerous here than in any other part of\r\nSikkim; and sitting at my tent-door, I could, without rising from the\r\nground, gather forty-three plants,[181] of which all but two belonged\r\nto English genera. In the rich soil about the cottages were crops of\r\ndock, shepherd’s-purse, _Thlaspi arvense, Cynoglossum_ of two kinds\r\n(one used as a pot-herb), balsams, nettle, _Galeopsis,_ mustard,\r\nradish, and turnip. On the neighbouring hills, which I explored up to\r\n15,000 feet, I found many fine plants, partaking more or less of the\r\nSiberian type, of which _Corydalis, Leguminosæ, Artemisia,_ and\r\n_Pedicularis,_ are familiar instances. I gathered upwards of 200\r\nspecies, nearly all belonging to north European genera. Twenty-five\r\nwere woody shrubs above three feet high, and six were ferns;[182]\r\nsedges were in great profusion, amongst them three of British kinds:\r\nseven or eight were _Orchideæ,_ including a fine _Cypripedium._\r\n\r\n [181] In England thirty is, on the average, the equivalent number of\r\n plants, which in favourable localities I have gathered in an equal\r\n space. In both cases many are seedlings of short-lived annuals, and in\r\n neither is the number a test of the luxuriance of the vegetation; it\r\n but shows the power which the different species exert in their\r\n struggle to obtain a place.\r\n\r\n\r\n [182] _Cryptogramma crispa, Davallia,_ two _Aspidia,_ and two\r\n _Polypodia._ I gathered ten at the same elevation, in the damper Zemu\r\n valley (see p. 49, note). I gathered in this valley a new species of\r\n the remarkable European genus _Struthiopteris,_ which has not been\r\n found elsewhere in the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entomology of Tallum, like its botany, was Siberian, Arctic types\r\noccurring at lower elevations than in the wetter parts of Sikkim. Of\r\nbeetles the honey-feeding ones prevailed, with European forms of others\r\nthat inhabit yak-droppings.[183] Bees were common, both _Bombus_ and\r\n_Andræna,_ but there were no wasps, and but few ants. Grasshoppers and\r\nother _Orthoptera_ were rare, as were _Hemiptera_; _Tipula_ was the\r\ncommon dipterous insect, with a small sand-fly: there were neither\r\nleeches, mosquitos, ticks, nor midges. Pigeons, red-legged crows, and\r\nhawks were the common birds; with a few waders in the marshes.\r\n\r\n [183] As _Aphodius_ and _Geotrupes._ Predaceous genera were very rare,\r\n as _Carabus_ and _Staphylinus,_ so typical of boreal regions.\r\n _Coccinella_ (lady-bird), which swarms at Dorjiling, does not ascend\r\n so high, and a _Clytus_ was the only longicorn. _Bupretis, Elater,_\r\n and _Blaps_ were found but rarely. Of butterflies, the _Machaon_\r\n seldom reaches this elevation, but the painted-lady, _Pontia, Colias,\r\n Hipparchia, Argynnis,_ and _Polyommatus,_ are all found.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing now fairly behind most of the great snow and rain-collecting\r\nmountains, I experienced a considerable change in the climate, which\r\ncharacterises all these rearward lofty valleys, where very little rain\r\nfalls, and that chiefly drizzle; but this is so constant that the\r\nweather feels chilly, raw, and comfortless, and I never returned dry\r\nfrom botanising. The early mornings were bright with views northwards\r\nof blue sky and Kinchinjhow, while to the south the lofty peak of\r\nTukcham, though much nearer, was seldom seen, and black cumuli and\r\nnimbi rolled up the steep valley of the Lachen to be dissipated in mist\r\nover Tallum. The sun’s rays were, however, powerful at intervals during\r\nthe forenoon, whence the mean maximum temperature of July occurred at\r\nabout 10 a.m. The temperature of the river was always high, varying\r\nwith the heat of the day from 47° to 52°; the mean being 50°.\r\n\r\nThese streams do not partake of the diurnal rise and fall, so\r\ncharacteristic of the Swiss rivers and those of the western Himalaya,\r\nwhere a powerful sun melts the glaciers by day, and their head-streams\r\nare frozen by night. Here the clouds alike prevent solar and nocturnal\r\nradiation, the temperature is more uniform, and the corroding power of\r\nthe damp southerly wind that blows strongly throughout the day is the\r\ngreat melting agent. One morning I saw a vivid and very beautiful halo\r\n20° distant from the sun’s disc; it was no doubt caused by snow in the\r\nhigher regions of the atmosphere, as a sharp shower of rain fell\r\nimmediately afterwards: these are rare phenomena in mountainous\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Singtam Soubah visited me daily, and we enjoyed long friendly\r\nconversations: he still insisted that the Yangchoo (the name he gave to\r\nthe Lachen at this place) was the boundary, and that I must not go any\r\nfurther. His first question was always “How long do you intend to\r\nremain here? have you not got all the plants and stones you want? you\r\ncan see the sun much better with those brasses and glasses[184] lower\r\ndown; it is very cold here, and there is no food:”—to all which I had\r\nbut one reply, that I should not return till I had visited Kongra Lama.\r\nHe was a portly man, and, I think, at heart good-natured: I had no\r\ndifficulty in drawing him on to talk about Tibet, and the holy city of\r\nTeshoo Loombo, with its thousands of gilt temples, nunneries, and\r\nconvents, its holiest of all the holy grand Lamas of Tibet, and all the\r\nwide Boodhist world besides. Had it even been politic, I felt it would\r\nbe unfair to be angry with a man who was evidently in a false position\r\nbetween myself and his two rulers, the Rajah and Dewan; who had a wife\r\nand family on the smiling flanks of Singtam, and who longed to be\r\nsoaking in the warm rain of Sikkim, drinking Murwa beer (a luxury\r\nunknown amongst these Tibetans) and gathering in his crops of rice,\r\nmillet, and buckwheat. Though I may owe him a grudge for his subsequent\r\nviolence, I still recall with pleasure the hours we spent together on\r\nthe banks of the Lachen. In all matters respecting the frontier, his\r\nlies were circumstantial; and he further took the trouble of bringing\r\ncountry people to swear that this was Cheen, and that there was no such\r\nplace as Kongra Lama. I had written to ask Dr. Campbell for a definite\r\nletter from Tchebu Lama on this point, but unfortunately my despatches\r\nwere lost; the messenger who conveyed them missed his footing in\r\ncrossing the Lachen, and escaped narrowly with life, while the turban\r\nin which the letters were placed was carried down the current.\r\n\r\n [184] Alluding to the sextant, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally the Soubah tried to persuade my people that one so incorrigibly\r\nobstinate must be mad, and that they had better leave me. One day,\r\nafter we had had a long discussion about the geography of the frontier,\r\nhe inflamed my curiosity by telling me that Kinchinjhow was a very holy\r\nmountain; more so than its sister-peaks of Chumulari and Kinchinjunga;\r\nand that both the Sikkim and Tibetan Lamas, and Chinese soldiers, were\r\nready to oppose my approach to it. This led to my asking him for a\r\nsketch of the mountains; he called for a large sheet of paper, and some\r\ncharcoal, and wanted to form his mountains of sand; I however ordered\r\nrice to be brought, and though we had but little, scattered it about\r\nwastefully. This had its effect: he stared at my wealth, for he had all\r\nalong calculated on starving me out, and retired, looking perplexed and\r\ncrestfallen. Nothing puzzled him so much as my being always occupied\r\nwith such, to him, unintelligible pursuits; a Tibetan “cui bono?” was\r\nalways in his mouth: “What good will it do _you_?” “Why should you\r\nspend weeks on the coldest, hungriest, windiest, loftiest place on the\r\nearth, without even inhabitants?” Drugs and idle curiosity he believed\r\nwere my motives, and possibly a reverence for the religion of Boodh,\r\nSakya, and Tsongkaba. Latterly he had made up his mind to starve me\r\nout, and was dismayed when he found I could hold out better than\r\nhimself, and when I assured him that I should not retrace my steps\r\nuntil his statements should be verified by a letter from Tchebu; that I\r\nhad written to him, and that it would be at least thirty days before I\r\ncould receive an answer.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July he proposed to take me to Tungu, at the foot of\r\nKinchinjhow, and back, upon ponies, provided I would leave my people\r\nand tent, which I refused to do. After this I saw little of him for\r\nseveral days, and began to fear he was offended, when one morning his\r\nattendant came to me for medicine with a dismal countenance, and in\r\ngreat alarm: he twisted his fingers together over his stomach to\r\nsymbolise the nature of the malady which produced a commotion in his\r\nmaster’s bowels, and which was simply the colic. I was aware that he\r\nhad been reduced to feed upon “Tong” (the arum-root) and herbs, and had\r\nalways given him half the pigeons I shot, which was almost the only\r\nanimal food I had myself. Now I sent him a powerful dose of medicine;\r\nadding a few spoonfuls of China tea and sugar for friendship.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, being convalescent, he visited me, looking wofully yellow.\r\nAfter a long pause, during which he tried to ease himself of some\r\nweighty matter, he offered to take me to Tungu with my tent and people,\r\nand, thence to Kongra Lama, if I would promise to stay but two nights.\r\nI asked whether Tungu was in Cheen or Sikkim; he replied that after\r\ngreat enquiry he had heard that it was really in Sikkim; “Then,” said\r\nI, “we will both go to-morrow morning to Tungu, and I will stay there\r\nas long as I please:” he laughed, and gave in with apparent good grace.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Tallum, the valley contracts, passing over great ancient\r\nmoraines, and again expanding wider than before into broad grassy\r\nflats. The vegetation rapidly diminishes in stature and abundance, and\r\nthough the ascent to Tungu is trifling, the change in species is very\r\ngreat. The _Spiræa,_ maple, _Pieris,_ cherry, and larch disappear,\r\nleaving only willow, juniper, stunted birch, silver fir, white rose,\r\n_Aralia,_ berberry, currant, and more rhododendrons than all these put\r\ntogether;[185] while mushrooms and other English fungi[186] grew\r\namongst the grass.\r\n\r\n [185] _Cyananthus,_ a little blue flower allied to _Campanula,_ and\r\n one of the most beautiful alpines I know, covered the turfy ground,\r\n with _Orchis, Pedicularis, Gentian, Potentilla, Geranium,_ purple and\r\n yellow _Meconopsis,_ and the _Artemisia_ of Dorjiling, which ascends\r\n to 12,000 feet, and descends to the plains, having a range of 11,500\r\n feet in elevation. Of ferns, _Hymenophyllum, Cistopteris,_ and\r\n _Cryptogramma crispa_ ascend thus high.\r\n\r\n\r\n [186] One of great size, growing in large clumps, is the English\r\n _Agaricus comans,_ Fr., and I found it here at 12,500 feet, as also\r\n the beautiful genus _Crucibulum,_ which is familiar to us in England,\r\n growing on rotten sticks, and resembling a diminutive bird’s nest with\r\n eggs in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tungu village]\r\n\r\nTungu occupies a very broad valley, at the junction of the Tungu-choo\r\nfrom the east, and the Lachen from the north. The hills slope gently\r\nupwards to 16,000 feet, at an average angle of 15°; they are flat and\r\ngrassy at the base, and no snow is anywhere to be seen.[187] A\r\nstupendous rock, about fifty feet high, lay in the middle of the\r\nvalley, broken in two: it may have been detached from a cliff, or have\r\nbeen transported thither as part of an ancient moraine which extends\r\nfrom the mouth of the Tungu-choo valley across that of the Lachen. The\r\nappearance and position of this great block, and of the smaller piece\r\nlying beside it, rather suggest the idea of the whole mass having\r\nfallen perpendicularly from a great height through a _crevasse_ in a\r\nglacier, than of its having been hurled from so considerable a distance\r\nas from the cliffs on the flanks of the valley: it is faithfully\r\nrepresented in the accompanying woodcut. A few wooden houses were\r\ncollected near this rock, and several black tents were scattered about.\r\nI encamped at an elevation of 12,750 feet, and was waited on by the\r\nLachen Phipun with presents of milk, butter, yak-flesh, and curds; and\r\nwe were not long before we drowned old enmity in buttered and salted\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n [187] In the wood-cut the summit of Chomiomo is introduced, as it\r\n appears from a few hundred feet above the point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my arrival I found the villagers in a meadow, all squatted\r\ncross-legged in a circle, smoking their brass and iron pipes, drinking\r\ntea, and listening to a letter from the Rajah, concerning their\r\ntreatment of me. Whilst my men were pitching my tent, I gathered forty\r\nplants new to me, all of Tartarian types.[188] Wheat or barley I was\r\nassured had been cultivated at Tungu when it was possessed by Tibetans,\r\nand inhabited by a frontier guard, but I saw no appearance of any\r\ncultivation. The fact is an important one, as barley requires a mean\r\nsummer temperature of 48° to come to maturity. According to my\r\nobservations, the mean temperature of Tungu in July is upwards of 50°,\r\nand, by calculation, that of the three summer months, June, July, and\r\nAugust, should be about 46·5°. As, however, I do not know whether these\r\ncerealia were grown as productive crops, much stress cannot be laid\r\nupon the fact of their having been cultivated, for in a great many\r\nparts of Tibet the barley is annually cut green for fodder.\r\n\r\n [188] More Siberian plants appeared, as _Astragali, Chenopodium,\r\n Artemisia,_ some grasses, new kinds of _Pedicularis, Delphinium,_ and\r\n some small Orchids. Three species of _Parnassia_ and six primroses\r\n made the turf gay, mixed with saxifrages, _Androsace_ and _Campanula._\r\n By the cottages was abundance of shepherd’s-purse, _Lepidium,_ and\r\n balsams, with dock, _Galeopsis,_ and _Cuscuta._ Several low dwarf\r\n species of honeysuckle formed stunted bushes like heather; and\r\n _Anisodus,_ a curious plant allied to _Hyoscyamus,_ whose leaves are\r\n greedily eaten by yaks, was very common.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening the sick came to me: their complaints, as usual, being\r\nrheumatism, ophthalmia, goitres, cuts, bruises, and poisoning by Tong\r\n(_Arum_), fungi, and other deleterious vegetables. At Tallum I attended\r\nan old woman who dressed her ulcers with _Plantago_ (plantain) leaves,\r\na very common Scotch remedy; the ribs being drawn out from the leaf,\r\nwhich is applied fresh: it is rather a strong application.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I was awakened by the shrill cries of the\r\nTibetan maidens, calling the yaks to be milked, “Toosh—toosh—toooosh,”\r\nin a gradually higher key; to which Toosh seemed supremely indifferent,\r\ntill quickened in her movements by a stone or stick, levelled with\r\nunerring aim at her ribs; these animals were changing their long\r\nwinter’s wool for sleek hair, and the former hung about them in ragged\r\nmasses, like tow. Their calves gambolled by their sides, the drollest\r\nof animals, like ass-colts in their antics, kicking up their short\r\nhind-legs, whisking their bushy tails in the air, rushing up and down\r\nthe grassy slopes, and climbing like cats to the top of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Soubah and Phipun came early to take me to Kongra Lama, bringing\r\nponies, genuine Tartars in bone and breed. Remembering the Dewan’s\r\nimpracticable saddle at Bhomsong, I stipulated for a horse-cloth or\r\npad, upon which I had no sooner jumped than the beast threw back his\r\nears, seated himself on his haunches, and, to consternation, slid\r\nbackwards down a turfy slope, pawing the earth with his fore-feet as he\r\nwent, and leaving me on the ground, amid shrieks of laughter from my\r\nLepchas. My steed being caught, I again mounted, and was being led\r\nforward, when he took to shaking himself like a dog till the pad\r\nslipped under his belly, and I was again unhorsed. Other ponies\r\ndisplayed equal prejudices against my mode of riding, or having my\r\nweight anywhere but well on their shoulders, being all-powerful in\r\ntheir fore-quarters; and so I was compelled to adopt the high\r\ndemi-pique saddle with short stirrups, which forced me to sit with my\r\nknees up to my nose, and to grip with the calves of my legs and heels.\r\nAll the gear was of yak or horse-hair, and the bit was a curb and ring,\r\nor a powerful twisted snaffle.\r\n\r\nThe path ran N.N.W. for two miles, and then crossed the Lachen above\r\nits junction with the Nunee[189] from the west: the stream was rapid,\r\nand twelve yards in breadth; its temperature was 48°. About six miles\r\nabove Tungu, the Lachen is joined by the Chomio-choo, a large affluent\r\nfrom Chomiomo mountain. Above this the Lachen meanders along a broad\r\nstony bed; and the path rises over a great ancient moraine, whose level\r\ntop is covered with pools, but both that and its south face are bare,\r\nfrom exposure to the south wind, which blows with fury through this\r\ncontracted part of the valley to the rarified atmosphere of the lofty,\r\nopen, and dry country beyond. Its north slope, on the contrary, is\r\ncovered with small trees and brushwood, rhododendron, birch,\r\nhoneysuckle, and mountain-ash. These are the most northern shrubs in\r\nSikkim, and I regarded them with deep interest, as being possibly the\r\nlast of their kind to be met with in this meridian, for many degrees\r\nfurther north: perhaps even no similar shrubs occur between this and\r\nthe Siberian Altai, a distance of 1,500 miles. The magnificent yellow\r\ncowslip (_Primula Sikkimensis_) gilded the marshes, and _Caltha,_[190]\r\n_Trollius,_ Anemone, _Arenaria, Draba,_ Saxifrages, Potentillas,\r\nRanunculus, and other very alpine plants abounded.\r\n\r\n [189] I suspect there is a pass by the Nunee to the sheds I saw up the\r\n Zemu valley on the 2nd of July, as I observed yaks grazing high up the\r\n mountains: the distance cannot be great, and there is little or no\r\n snow to interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\n [190] This is the _C. scaposa,_ n. sp. The common _Caltha palustris,_\r\n or “marsh marigold” of England, which is not found in Sikkim, is very\r\n abundant in the north-west Himalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the moraine was a Tibetan camp of broad, black, yak-hair\r\ntents, stretched out with a complicated system of ropes, and looking at\r\na distance—(to borrow M. Huc’s graphic simile)—like fat-bodied,\r\nlong-legged spiders! Their general shape is hexagonal, about twelve\r\nfeet either way, and they are stretched over six short posts, and\r\nencircled with a low stone wall, except in front. In one of them I\r\nfound a buxom girl, the image of good humour, making butter and curd\r\nfrom yak-milk. The churns were of two kinds; one being an oblong box of\r\nbirch-bark, or close bamboo wicker-work, full of branched rhododendron\r\ntwigs, in which the cream is shaken: she good-naturedly showed me the\r\ninside, which was frosted with snow-white butter, and alive with\r\nmaggots. The other churn was a goat-skin, which was rolled about, and\r\nshaken by the four legs. The butter is made into great squares, and\r\npacked in yak-hair cloths; the curd is eaten either fresh, or dried and\r\npulverised (when it is called “Ts’cheuzip”).\r\n\r\nExcept bamboo and copper milk-vessels, wooden ladles, tea-churn, and\r\npots, these tents contained no furniture but goat-skins and blankets,\r\nto spread on the ground as a bed. The fire was made of sheep and\r\ngoats’-droppings, lighted with juniper-wood; above it hung tufts of\r\nyaks’-hair, one for every animal lost during the season,[191] by which\r\nmeans a reckoning is kept. Although this girl had never before seen a\r\nEuropean, she seemed in no way discomposed at my visit, and gave me a\r\nlarge slice of fresh curd.\r\n\r\n [191] The Siberians hang tufts of horse-hair inside their houses from\r\n superstitious motives (Ermann’s “Siberia,” i., 281).\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond this place (alt. 14,500 feet), the valley runs up north-east,\r\nbecoming very stony and desolate, with green patches only by the\r\nwatercourses: at this place, however, thick fogs came on, and obscured\r\nall view. At 15,000 feet, I passed a small glacier on the west side of\r\nthe valley, the first I had met with that descended nearly to the\r\nriver, during the whole course of the Teesta.\r\n\r\nFive miles further on we arrived at the tents of the Phipun, whose wife\r\nwas prepared to entertain us with Tartar hospitality: magnificent tawny\r\nTibet mastiffs were baying at the tent-door, and some yaks and ponies\r\nwere grazing close by. We mustered twelve in number, and squatted\r\ncross-legged in a circle inside the tent, the Soubah and myself being\r\nplaced on a pretty Chinese rug. Salted and buttered tea was immediately\r\nprepared in a tea-pot for us on the mat, and in a great caldron for the\r\nrest of the party; parched rice and wheat-flour, curd, and roasted\r\nmaize[192] were offered us, and we each produced our wooden cup, which\r\nwas kept constantly full of scalding tea-soup, which, being made with\r\nfresh butter, was very good. The flour was the favourite food, of which\r\neach person dexterously formed little dough-balls in his cup, an\r\noperation I could not well manage, and only succeeded in making a\r\nnauseous paste, that stuck to my jaws and in my throat. Our hostess’\r\nhospitality was too _exigeant_ for me, but the others seemed as if they\r\ncould not drink enough of the scalding tea.\r\n\r\n [192] Called “pop-corn” in America, and prepared by roasting the maize\r\n in an iron vessel, when it splits and turns partly inside out,\r\n exposing a snow-white spongy mass of farina. It looks very handsome,\r\n and would make a beautiful dish for dessert.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were suddenly startled from our repast by a noise like loud thunder,\r\ncrash following crash, and echoing through the valley. The Phipun got\r\nup, and coolly said, “The rocks are falling, it is time we were off, it\r\nwill rain soon.” The moist vapours had by this time so accumulated, as\r\nto be condensed in rain on the cliffs of Chomiomo and Kinchinjhow;\r\nwhich, being loosened, precipitated avalanches of rocks and snow. We\r\nproceeded amidst dense fog, soon followed by hard rain; the roar of\r\nfalling rocks on either hand increasing as these invisible giants spoke\r\nto one another in voices of thunder through the clouds. The effect was\r\nindescribably grand: and as the weather cleared, and I obtained\r\ntransient peeps of their precipices of blue ice and black rock towering\r\n5000 feet above me on either hand, the feeling of awe produced was\r\nalmost overpowering. Heavy banks of vapour still veiled the mountains,\r\nbut the rising mist exposed a broad stony track, along which the Lachen\r\nwandered, split into innumerable channels, and enclosing little oases\r\nof green vegetation, lighted up by occasional gleams of sunshine.\r\nThough all around was enveloped in gloom, there was in front a high\r\nblue arc of cloudless sky, between the beetling cliffs that formed the\r\nstern portals of the Kongra Lama pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\nTop of Kongra Lama—Tibet frontier—Elevation—View—Vegetation—Descent to\r\nTungu—Tungu-choo—Ponies—Kinchinjhow and Changokhang mountains—Palung\r\nplains—Tibetans—Dogs—Dingcbam province of\r\nTibet—Inhabitants—Dresses—Women’s ornaments—Blackening\r\nfaces—Coral—Tents—Elevation of Palung—Lama—Shawl-wool\r\ngoats—Shearing—Siberian plants—Height of glaciers, and perpetual\r\nsnow—Geology—Plants, and wild animals—Marmots—Insects—Birds—Choongtam\r\nLama—Religious exercises—Tibetan hospitality—_Delphinium_—Perpetual\r\nsnow—Temperature at Tungu—Return to Tallum Samdong—To\r\nLamteng—Houses—Fall of Barometer—Cicadas—Lime deposit—Landslips—Arrival\r\nat Choongtam—Cobra—Rageu—Heat of Climate—Velocity and volume of rivers\r\nmeasured—Leave for Lachoong valley—Keadom—General features of\r\nvalley—Lachoong village—Tunkra mountain—Moraines—Cultivation—Lachoong\r\nPhipun—Lama ceremonies beside a sick-bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached the boundary between Sikkim and Tibet early in the\r\nafternoon; it is drawn along Kongra Lama, which is a low flat spur\r\nrunning east from Kinchinjhow towards Chomiomo, at a point where these\r\nmountains are a few miles apart, thus crossing the Lachen river:[193]\r\nit is marked by cairns of stone, some rudely fashioned into chaits,\r\ncovered with votive rags on wands of bamboo. I made the altitude by\r\nbarometer 15,745 feet above the sea, and by boiling water, 15,694 feet,\r\nthe water boiling at 184·1°; the temperature of the air between 2.40\r\nand 4 p.m. varied from 41·3° to 42·5°, the dew-point 39·8°; that of the\r\nLachen was 47°, which was remarkably high. We were bitterly cold; as\r\nthe previous rain had wetted us through, and a keen wind was blowing up\r\nthe valley. The continued mist and fog intercepted all view, except of\r\nthe flanks of the great mountains on either hand, of the rugged snowy\r\nones to the south, and of those bounding the Lachen to the north. The\r\nlatter were unsnowed, and appeared lower than Kongra Lama, the ground\r\napparently sloping away in that direction; but when I ascended them,\r\nthree months afterwards, I found they were 3000 feet higher! a proof\r\nhow utterly fallacious are estimates of height, when formed by the eye\r\nalone. My informants called them Peuka-t’hlo; “peu” signifies north in\r\nTibetan, and “t’hlo” a hill in Lepcha.\r\n\r\n [193] The upper valley of the Lachen in Tibet, which I ascended in the\r\n following October, is very open, flat, barren, and stony; it is\r\n bounded on the north by rounded spurs from Chomiomo, which are\r\n continued east to Donkia, forming a watershed to the Lachen on the\r\n south, and to the Arun on the north.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsolated patches of vegetation appeared on the top of the pass, where I\r\ngathered forty kinds of plants, most of them being of a tufted habit\r\ncharacteristic of an extreme climate; some (as species of\r\n_Caryophylleæ_) forming hemi-spherical balls on the naked soil;\r\nothers[194] growing in matted tufts level with the ground. The greater\r\nportion had no woolly covering; nor did I find any of the cottony\r\nspecies of _Saussurea,_ which are so common on the wetter mountains to\r\nthe southward. Some most delicate-flowered plants even defy the biting\r\nwinds of these exposed regions; such are a prickly _Meconopsis_ with\r\nslender flower-stalks and four large blue poppy-like petals, a\r\n_Cyananthus_ with a membranous bell-shaped corolla, and a fritillary.\r\nOther curious plants were a little yellow saxifrage with long runners\r\n(very like the arctic _S. flagellaris,_ of Spitzbergen and Melville\r\nIsland), and the strong-scented spikenard (_Nardostachys_).\r\n\r\n [194] The other plants found on the pass were; of smooth hairless\r\n ones, _Ranunculus,_ Fumitory, several species of _Stellaria, Arenaria,\r\n Cruciferæ, Parnassia, Morina,_ saxifrages, _Sedum,_ primrose,\r\n _Herminium, Polygonum, Campanula, Umbelliferæ,_ grasses and _Carices_:\r\n of woolly or hairy once, _Anemone, Artemisia, Myosotis, Draba,\r\n Potentilla,_ and several _Compositæ,_ etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks were chiefly of reddish quartz, and so was the base of\r\nChomiomo. Kinchinjhow on the contrary was of gneiss, with granite\r\nveins: the strike of both was north-west, and the dip north-east 20° to\r\n30°.\r\n\r\nWe made a fire at the top with sheep’s droppings, of which the Phipun\r\nhad brought up a bagfull, and with it a pair of goat-skin bellows,\r\nwhich worked by a slit that was opened by the hand in the act of\r\nraising; when inflated, the hole was closed, and the skin pressed down,\r\nthus forcing the air through the bamboo nozzle: this is the common form\r\nof bellows throughout Tibet and the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours I was very stiff and cold, and suffering from headache\r\nand giddiness, owing to the elevation; and having walked about thirteen\r\nmiles botanizing, I was glad to ride down. We reached the Phipun’s\r\ntents about 6 p.m., and had more tea before proceeding to Tungu. The\r\nnight was fortunately fine and calm, with a few stars and a bright\r\nyoung moon, which, with the glare from the snows, lighted up the\r\nvalley, and revealed magnificent glimpses of the majestic mountains. As\r\nthe moon sank, and we descended the narrowing valley, darkness came on,\r\nand with a boy to lead my sure-footed pony, I was at liberty\r\nuninterruptedly to reflect on the events of a day, on which I had\r\nattained the object of so many years’ ambition. Now that all obstacles\r\nwere surmounted, and I was returning laden with materials for extending\r\nthe knowledge of a science which had formed the pursuit of my life,\r\nwill it be wondered at that I felt proud, not less for my own sake,\r\nthan for that of the many friends, both in India and at home, who were\r\ninterested in my success?\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Tungu at 9 p.m., my pony not having stumbled once, though\r\nthe path was rugged, and crossed by many rapid streams. The Soubah’s\r\nlittle shaggy steed had carried his portly frame (fully fifteen stone\r\nweight) the whole way out and back, and when he dismounted, it shook\r\nitself, snorted, and seemed quite ready for supper.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I was occupied in noting and arranging my\r\ncollections, which consisted of upwards of 200 plants; all gathered\r\nabove 14,000 feet elevation.[195] Letters arrived from Dorjiling with\r\nunusual speed, having been only seventeen days on the road: they were\r\nfull of valuable suggestions and encouragement from my friends Hodgson,\r\nCampbell, and Tchebu Lama.\r\n\r\n [195] Amongst them the most numerous Natural orders and genera were,\r\n _Cruciferæ_ 10; _Compositæ_ 20; _Ranunculaceæ_ 10; _Alsineæ_ 9;\r\n _Astragali_ 10; _Potentillæ_ 8; grasses 12; _Carices_ 15;\r\n _Pedicularis_ 7; _Boragineæ_ 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of July the Phipun, who waited on me every morning with\r\nmilk and butter, and whose civility and attentions were now\r\nunremitting, proposed that I should accompany him to an encampment of\r\nTibetans, at the foot of Kinchinjhow. We mounted ponies, and ascended\r\nthe Tunguchoo eastwards: it was a rapid river for the first thousand\r\nfeet, flowing in a narrow gorge, between sloping, grassy, and rocky\r\nhills, on which large herds of yaks were feeding, tended by women and\r\nchildren, whose black tents were scattered about. The yak-calves left\r\ntheir mothers to run beside our ponies, which became unmanageable,\r\nbeing almost callous to the bit; and the whole party was sometimes\r\ncareering over the slopes, chased by the grunting herds: in other\r\nplaces, the path was narrow and dangerous, when the sagacious animals\r\nproceeded with the utmost gravity and caution. Rounding one rocky spur,\r\nmy pony stumbled, and pitched me forward: fortunately I lighted on the\r\npath.\r\n\r\nThe rocks were gneiss, with granite veins (strike north-east, dip\r\nsouth-east): they were covered with _Ephedra,_[196] an _Onosma_ which\r\nyields a purple dye, _Orchis,_ and species of _Androsace_; while the\r\nslopes were clothed with the spikenard and purple _Pedicularis,_ and\r\nthe moist grounds with yellow cowslip and long grass. A sudden bend in\r\nthe valley opened a superb view to the north, of the full front of\r\nKinchinjhow, extending for four or five miles east and west; its\r\nperpendicular sides studded with the immense icicles, which are said to\r\nhave obtained for it the name of “jhow,”—the “bearded” Kinchin.\r\nEastward a jagged spur stretches south, rising into another splendid\r\nmountain, called Chango-khang (the Eagle’s crag), from whose flanks\r\ndescend great glaciers, the sources of the Tunguchoo.\r\n\r\n [196] A curious genus of small shrubs allied to pines, that grows in\r\n the south of Europe. This species is the European _E. vulgaris_; it\r\n inhabits the driest parts of north-west India, and ascends to 17,000\r\n feet in Tibet, but is not found in the moist intervening countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe followed the course of an affluent, called the Chachoo, along whose\r\nbed ancient moraines rose in successive ridges: on these I found\r\nseveral other species of European genera.[197] Over one of these\r\nmoraines, 500 feet high, the path ascends to the plains of Palung, an\r\nelevated grassy expanse, two miles long and four broad, extending\r\nsouthward from the base of Kinchinjhow. Its surface, though very level\r\nfor so mountainous a country, is yet varied with open valleys and\r\nsloping hills, 500 to 700 feet high: it is bounded on the west by low\r\nrounded spurs from Kinchinjhow, that form the flank of the Lachen\r\nvalley; while on the east it is separated from Chango-khang by the\r\nChachoo, which cuts a deep east and west trench along the base of\r\nKinchinjhow, and then turns south to the Tunguchoo. The course of the\r\nChachoo, where it turns south, is most curious: it meanders in\r\nsickle-shaped curves along the marshy bottom of an old lake-bed, with\r\nsteep shelving sides, 500 to 600 feet deep, and covered with juniper\r\nbushes.[198] It is fed by the glaciers of Kinchinjhow, and some little\r\nlakes to the east.\r\n\r\n [197] _Delphinium, Hypecoum, Sagina, Gymnandra, Artemisia, Caltha,\r\n Dracocephalum, Leontopodium._\r\n\r\n\r\n [198] These, which grow on an eastern exposure, exist at a higher\r\n elevation than any other bushes I have met with.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mean height of Palung plains is 16,000 feet: they are covered with\r\ntransported blocks, and I have no doubt their surface has been much\r\nmodified by glacial action. I was forcibly reminded of them by the\r\nslopes of the Wengern Alp, but those of Palung are far more level.\r\nKinchinjhow rises before the spectator, just as the Jungfrau, Mönch,\r\nand Eigher Alps do from that magnificent point of view.\r\n\r\nOn ascending a low hill, we came in sight of the Tibet camp at the\r\ndistance of a mile, when the great mastiffs that guarded it immediately\r\nbayed; and our ponies starting off at full gallop, we soon reached an\r\nenclosure of stone dykes, within which the black tents were pitched.\r\nThe dogs were of immense size, and ragged, like the yaks, from their\r\nwinter coat hanging to their flanks in great masses; each was chained\r\nnear a large stone, on and off which he leapt as he gave tongue; they\r\nare very savage, but great cowards, and not remarkable for\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lepcha girls and Tibetan women]\r\n\r\nThe people were natives of Gearee and Kambajong, in the adjacent\r\nprovince of Dingcham, which is the loftiest, coldest, most windy and\r\narid in Eastern Tibet; and in which are the sources of all the streams\r\nthat flow to Nepal; Sikkim, and Bhotan on the one side, and into the\r\nYaru-tsampu on the other. These families repair yearly to Palung, with\r\ntheir flocks, herds, and tents, paying tribute to the Sikkim Rajah for\r\nthe privilege: they arrive in June and leave in September. Both men and\r\nwomen were indescribably filthy; as they never wash, their faces were\r\nperfectly black with smoke and exposure, and the women’s with a pigment\r\nof grease as a protection from the wind. The men were dressed as usual,\r\nin the blanket-cloak, with brass pipes, long knives, flint, steel, and\r\namulets; the women wore similar, but shorter cloaks, with silver and\r\ncopper girdles, trowsers, and flannel boots. Their head-dresses were\r\nvery remarkable. A circular band of plaited yak’s hair was attached to\r\nthe back hair, and encircled the head like a saint’s glory,[199] at\r\nsome distance round it. A band crossed the forehead, from which coins,\r\ncorals, and turquoises, hung down to the eyebrows, while lappets of\r\nthese ornaments fell over the ears. Their own hair was plaited in two\r\ntails, brought over the shoulders, and fastened together in front; and\r\na little yellow felt cap, traversely elongated, so as not to interfere\r\nwith the shape of the glory, was perched on the head. Their\r\ncountenances were pleasing, and their manners timid.\r\n\r\n [199] I find in Ermann’s “Siberia” (i., p. 210), that the married\r\n women of Yekaterinberg wear a head-dress like an ancient glory covered\r\n with jewels, whilst the unmarried ones plait their tresses. The same\r\n distinguished traveller mentions having seen a lad of six years old\r\n suckled, amongst the Tungooze of East Siberia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children crawled half-naked about the tent, or burrowed like moles\r\nin an immense heap of goats’ and sheep-droppings, piled up for fuel,\r\nupon which the family lounged. An infant in arms was playing with a\r\n“coral,” ornamented much like ours, and was covered with jewels and\r\ncoins. This custom of decorating children is very common amongst\r\nhalf-civilised people; and the coral is, perhaps, one of the last\r\nrelics of a barbarous age that is retained amongst ourselves. One\r\nmother was nursing her baby, and churning at the same time, by rolling\r\nthe goat-skin of yak-milk about on the ground. Extreme poverty induces\r\nthe practice of nursing the children for years; and in one tent I saw a\r\nlad upwards of four years of age unconcernedly taking food from his\r\naunt, and immediately afterwards chewing hard dry grains of maize.\r\n\r\nThe tents were pitched in holes about two feet and a half deep; and\r\nwithin them a wall of similar height was built all round: in the middle\r\nwas a long clay arched fire-place, with holes above, over which the\r\ncauldrons were placed, the fire being underneath. Saddles,\r\nhorse-cloths, and the usual accoutrements and implements of a nomad\r\npeople, all of the rudest description, hung about: there was no bed or\r\nstool, but Chinese rugs for sleeping on. I boiled water on the\r\nfire-place; its temperature (184·5°) with that of the air (45·5°) gave\r\nan elevation of 15,867 feet. Barometric observations, taken in October,\r\nat a point considerably lower down the stream, made the elevation\r\n15,620 feet, or a few feet lower than Kongra Lama pass.\r\n\r\nA Lama accompanied this colony of Tibetans, a festival in honour of\r\nKinchinjhow being annually held at a large chait hard by, which is\r\npainted red, ornamented with banners, and surmounted by an enormous\r\nyak’s skull, that faces the mountain. The Lama invited me into his\r\ntent, where I found a wife and family. An extempore altar was at one\r\nend, covered with wafers and other pretty ornaments, made of butter,\r\nstamped or moulded with the fingers.[200] The tents being insupportably\r\nnoisome, I preferred partaking of the buttered brick-tea in the open\r\nair; after which, I went to see the shawl-wool goats sheared in a pen\r\nclose by. There are two varieties: one is a large animal, with great\r\nhorns, called “Rappoo;”[201] the other smaller, and with slender horns,\r\nis called “Tsilloo.” The latter yields the finest wool, but they are\r\nmixed for ordinary purposes. I was assured that the sheep (of which\r\nlarge flocks were grazing near) afford the finest wool of any. The\r\nanimals were caught by the tail, their legs tied, the long winter’s\r\nhair pulled out, and the remainder cut away with a broad flat knife,\r\nwhich was sharpened with a scythe-stone. The operation was clumsily\r\nperformed, and the skin much cut.\r\n\r\n [200] The extensive use of these ornaments throughout Tibet, on the\r\n occasion of religious festivals, is alluded to by MM. Huc and Gabet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [201] This is the “Changra;” and the smaller the “Chyapu” of Mr.\r\n Hodgson’s catalogue. (See “British Museum Catalogue.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nTurnips are grown at Palung during the short stay of the people, and\r\nthis is the most alpine cultivation in Sikkim: the seed is sown early\r\nin July, and the tubers are fit to be eaten in October, if the season\r\nis favourable. They did not come to maturity this year, as I found on\r\nagain visiting this spot in October; but their tops had afforded the\r\npoor Tibetans some good vegetables. The mean temperature of the three\r\nsummer months at Palung is probably about 40°, an element of\r\ncomparatively little importance in regulating the growth and ripening\r\nof vegetables at great elevations in Tibetan climates; where a warm\r\nexposure, the amount of sunshine, and of radiated heat, have a much\r\ngreater influence.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, when these families repair to Kambajong, in Tibet,\r\nthe flocks and herds are all stall-fed, with long grass, cut on the\r\nmarshy banks of the Yaru. Snow is said to fall five feet deep at that\r\nplace, chiefly after January; and it melts in April.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, I ascended the hills overhanging the Lachen valley, which\r\nare very bare and stony; large flocks of sheep were feeding on them,\r\nchiefly upon small tufted sedges, allied to the English _Carex\r\npilularis,_ which here forms the greatest part of the pasture: the\r\ngrass grows mixed with it in small tufts, and is the common Scotch\r\nmountain pasture-grass (_Festuca ovina_).\r\n\r\nOn the top of these hills, which, for barrenness, reminded me of the\r\ndescriptions given of the Siberian steppes, I found, at 17,000 feet\r\nelevation, several minute arctic plants, with _Rhododendron nivale,_\r\nthe most alpine of woody plants. On their sterile slopes grew a curious\r\nplant allied to the _Cherleria_ of the Scotch Alps, forming great\r\nhemispherical balls on the ground, eight to ten inches across,\r\naltogether resembling in habit the curious Balsambog (_Bolax glebaria_)\r\nof the Falkland Islands, which grows in very similar scenes.[202]\r\n\r\n [202] _Arenaria rupifraga,_ Fenzl. This plant is mentioned by Dr.\r\n Thomson (“Travels in Tibet,” p. 426) as common in Tibet, as far north\r\n as the Karakoram, at an elevation between 16,000 and 18,000 feet. In\r\n Sikkim it is found at the same level. Specimens of it are exhibited in\r\n the Kew Museum. As one instance illustrative of the chaotic state of\r\n Indian botany, I may here mention that this little plant, a denizen of\r\n such remote and inaccessible parts of the globe, and which has only\r\n been known to science a dozen years, bears the burthen of no less than\r\n six names in botanical works. This is the _Bryomorpha rupifraga_ of\r\n Karelin and Kireloff (enumeration of Soongarian plants), who first\r\n described it from specimens gathered in 1841, on the Alatau mountains\r\n (east of Lake Aral). In Ledebour’s “Flora Rossica” (i. p. 780) it\r\n appears as _Arenaria_ (sub-genus _Dicranilla_) _rupifraga,_ Fenzl, MS.\r\n In Decaisne and Cambessede’s Plants of Jacquemont’s “Voyage aus Indes\r\n Orientales,” it is described as _Flourensia cæspitosa,_ and in the\r\n plates of that work it appears as _Periandra cæspitosa_; and lastly,\r\n in Endlicher’s “Genera Plantarum,” Fenzl proposes the long new generic\r\n name of _Thylacospermum_ for it. I have carefully compared the\r\n Himalayan and Alatau plants, and find no difference between them,\r\n except that the flower of the Himalayan one has 4 petals and sepals, 8\r\n stamens, and 2 styles, and that of the Alatau 5 petals and sepals, 10\r\n stamens, and 2-3 styles, characters which are very variable in allied\r\n plants. The flowers appear polygamous, as in the Scotch alpine\r\n _Cherleria,_ which it much resembles in habit, and to which it is very\r\n nearly related in botanical characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, I again visited Palung, with the view of\r\nascertaining the height of perpetual snow on the south face of\r\nKinchinjhow; unfortunately, bad weather came on before I reached the\r\nTibetans, from whom I obtained a guide in consequence. From this place\r\na ride of about four miles brought me to the source of the Chachoo, in\r\na deep ravine, containing the terminations of several short, abrupt\r\nglaciers,[203] and into which were precipitated avalanches of snow and\r\nice. I found it impossible to distinguish the glacial ice from\r\nperpetual snow; the larger beds of snow where presenting a flat\r\nsurface, being generally drifts collected in hollows, or accumulations\r\nthat have fallen from above: when these accumulations rest on slopes\r\nthey become converted into ice, and obeying the laws of fluidity, flow\r\ndownwards as glaciers. I boiled water at the most advantageous position\r\nI could select, and obtained an elevation of 16,522 feet.[204] It was\r\nsnowing heavily at this time, and we crouched under a gigantic boulder,\r\nbenumbed with cold. I had fortunately brought a small phial of brandy,\r\nwhich, with hot water from the boiling-apparatus kettle, refreshed us\r\nwonderfully.\r\n\r\n [203] De Saussure’s glaciers of the second order: see “Forbes’ Travels\r\n in the Alps,” p. 79.\r\n\r\n\r\n [204] Temperature of boiling water, 183°, air 35°.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spur that divides these plains from the Lachen river, rises close\r\nto Kinchinjhow, as a lofty cliff of quartzy gneiss, dipping north-east\r\n30°: this I had noticed from the Kongra Lama side. On this side the dip\r\nwas also to the northward, and the whole cliff was crossed by cleavage\r\nplanes, dipping south, and apparently cutting those of the foliation at\r\nan angle of about 60°: it is the only decided instance of the kind I\r\nmet with in Sikkim. I regretted not being able to examine it carefully,\r\nbut I was prevented by the avalanches of stones and snow which were\r\ncontinually being detached from its surface.[205]\r\n\r\n [205] I extremely regret not having been at this time acquainted with\r\n Mr. D. Sharpe’s able essays on the foliation, cleavage, etc., of slaty\r\n rocks, gneiss, etc., in the Geological Society’s Journal (ii. p. 74,\r\n and v. p. 111), and still more so with his subsequent papers in the\r\n Philosophical Transactions: as I cannot doubt that many of his\r\n observations, and in particular those which refer to the great arches\r\n in which the folia (commonly called strata) are disposed, would\r\n receive ample illustration from a study of the Himalaya. At vol. i. p.\r\n 309, I have distantly alluded to such an arrangement of the gneiss,\r\n etc., into arches, in Sikkim, to which my attention was naturally\r\n drawn by the writings of Professor Sedgwick (“Geolog. Soc. Trans.”)\r\n and Mr. Darwin (“Geological Observations in South America”) on these\r\n obscure subjects. I may add that wherever I met with the gneiss, mica,\r\n schists, and slates, in Sikkim, very near one another, I invariably\r\n found that their cleavage and foliation were conformable. This, for\r\n example, may be seen in the bed of the great Rungeet, below Dorjiling,\r\n where the slates overlie mica schists, and where the latter contain\r\n beds of conglomerate. In these volumes I have often used the more\r\n familiar term of stratification, for foliation. This arises from my\r\n own ideas of the subject not having been clear when the notes were\r\n taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plants found close to the snow were minute primroses, _Parnassia,\r\nDraba,_ tufted wormwoods (_Artemisia_), saxifrages, gentian, small\r\n_Compositæ,_ grasses, and sedges. Our ponies unconcernedly scraped away\r\nthe snow with their hoofs, and nibbled the scanty herbage. When I\r\nmounted mine, he took the bit between his teeth, and scampered back to\r\nPalung, over rocks and hills, through bogs and streams; and though the\r\nsnow was so blinding that no object could be distinguished, he brought\r\nme to the tents with unerring instinct, as straight as an arrow.\r\n\r\nWild animals are few in kind and rare in individuals, at Tungu and\r\nelsewhere on this frontier; though there is no lack of cover and\r\nherbage. This must be owing to the moist cold atmosphere; and it\r\nreminds me that a similar want of animal life is characteristic of\r\nthose climates at the level of the sea, which I have adduced as bearing\r\na great analogy to the Himalaya, in lacking certain natural orders of\r\nplants. Thus, New Zealand and Fuegia possess, the former no land animal\r\nbut a rat, and the latter very few indeed, and none of any size. Such\r\nis also the case in Scotland and Norway. Again, on the damp west coast\r\nof Tasmania, quadrupeds are rare; whilst the dry eastern half of the\r\nisland once swarmed with opossums and kangaroos. A few miles north of\r\nTungu, the sterile and more lofty provinces of Tibet abound in wild\r\nhorses, antelopes, hares, foxes, marmots, and numerous other\r\nquadrupeds; although their altitude, climate, and scanty vegetation are\r\napparently even more unsuited to support such numbers of animals of so\r\nlarge a size than the karroos of South Africa, and the steppes of\r\nSiberia and Arctic America, which similarly abound in animal life. The\r\nlaws which govern the distribution of large quadrupeds seem to be\r\nintimately connected with those of climate; and we should have regard\r\nto these considerations in our geological speculations, and not draw\r\nhasty conclusions from the absence of the remains of large herbivora in\r\nformations disclosing a redundant vegetation.\r\n\r\nBesides the wild sheep found on these mountains, a species of\r\nmarmot[206] (“Kardiepieu” of the Tibetans) sometimes migrates in swarms\r\n(like the Lapland “Lemming”) from Tibet as far as Tungu. There are few\r\nbirds but red-legged crows and common ravens. Most of the insects\r\nbelonged to arctic types, and they were numerous in individuals.[207]\r\n\r\n [206] The _Lagopus Tibetanus_ of Hodgson. I procured one that\r\n displayed an extraordinary tenacity of life: part of the skull was\r\n shot away, and the brain protruded; still it showed the utmost terror\r\n at my dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n [207] As _Meloe,_ and some flower-feeding lamellicorns. Of butterflies\r\n I saw blues (_Polyommatus_), marbled whites, _Pontia, Colias_ and\r\n _Argynnis._ A small _Curculio_ was frequent, and I found\r\n _Scolopendra,_ ants and earthworms, on sunny exposures as high as\r\n 15,500 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibet marmot]\r\n\r\nThe Choongtam Lama was at a small temple near Tungu during the whole of\r\nmy stay, but he would not come to visit me, pretending to be absorbed\r\nin his devotions. Passing one day by the temple, I found him\r\ncatechising two young aspirants for holy orders. He is one of the Dukpa\r\nsect, wore his mitre, and was seated cross-legged on the grass with his\r\nscriptures on his knees: he put questions to the boys, when he who\r\nanswered best took the other some yards off, put him down on his hands\r\nand knees, threw a cloth over his back, and mounted; then kicking,\r\nspurring, and cuffing his steed, he was galloped back to the Lama and\r\nkicked off; when the catechising recommenced.\r\n\r\nI spent a week at Tungu most pleasantly, ascending the neighbouring\r\nmountains, and mixing with the people, whom I found uniformly kind,\r\nfrank, and extremely hospitable; sending their children after me to\r\ninvite me to stop at their tents, smoke, and drink tea; often refusing\r\nany remuneration, and giving my attendants curds and yak-flesh. If on\r\nfoot, I was entreated to take a pony; and when tired I never scrupled\r\nto catch one, twist a yak-hair rope over its jaw as a bridle, and\r\nthrowing a goat-hair cloth upon its back (if no saddle were at hand),\r\nride away whither I would. Next morning a boy would be sent for the\r\nsteed, perhaps bringing an invitation to come and take it again. So I\r\nbecame fond of brick-tea boiled with butter, salt, and soda, and expert\r\nin the Tartar saddle; riding about perched on the shoulders of a rough\r\npony, with my feet nearly on a level with my pockets, and my knees\r\nalmost meeting in front.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July much snow fell on the hills around, as low as\r\n14,000 feet, and half an inch of rain at Tungu;[208] the former soon\r\nmelted, and I made an excursion to Chomiomo on the following day,\r\nhoping to reach the lower line of perpetual snow. Ascending the valley\r\nof the Chomiochoo, I struck north up a steep slope, that ended in a\r\nspur of vast tabular masses of quartz and felspar, piled like slabs in\r\na stone quarry, dipping south-west 5° to 10°, and striking north-west.\r\nThese resulted from the decomposition of gneiss, from which the layers\r\nof mica bad been washed away, when the rain and frost splitting up the\r\nfragments, the dislocation is continued to a great depth into the\r\nsubstance of the rock.\r\n\r\n [208] An inch and a half fell at Dorjiling during the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge silky cushions of a forget-me-not grew amongst the rocks,\r\nspangled with beautiful blue flowers, and looking like turquoises set\r\nin silver: the _Delphininin glaciale_[209] was also abundant, exhaling\r\na rank smell of musk. It indicates a very great elevation in Sikkim,\r\nand on my ascent far above it, therefore, I was not surprised to find\r\nwater boil at 182·6° (air 43°), which gives an altitude of 16,754 feet.\r\n\r\n [209] This new species has been described for the “Flora Indica” of\r\n Dr. Thomson and myself: it is a remarkable plant, very closely\r\n resembling, and as it were representing, the _D. Brunonianum_ of the\r\n western Himalaya. The latter plant smells powerfully of musk, but not\r\n so disagreeably as this does.\r\n\r\n\r\nA dense fog, with sleet, shut out all view; and I did not know in what\r\ndirection to proceed higher, beyond the top of the sharp, stony ridge I\r\nhad attained. Here there was no perpetual snow, which is to be\r\naccounted for by the nature of the surface facilitating its removal,\r\nthe edges of the rocks which project through the snow, becoming heated,\r\nand draining off the water as it melts.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Tungu, from the 23rd to the 30th of July, no day\r\npassed without much deposition of moisture, but generally in so light a\r\nform that throughout the whole time but one inch was registered in the\r\nrain-gauge; during the same time four inches and a half of rain fell at\r\nDorjiling, and three inches and a half at Calcutta. The mean\r\ntemperature was 50° (max. 65°, min. 40·7°); extremes, 65/38°. The mean\r\nrange (23·3°) was thus much greater than at Dorjiling, where it was\r\nonly 8·9°. A thermometer, sunk three feet, varied only a few tenths\r\nfrom 57·6°. By twenty-five comparative observations with Calcutta, 1°\r\nFahr. is the equivalent of every 362 feet of ascent; and twenty\r\ncomparative observations with Dorjiling give 1° for every 340 feet. The\r\nbarometer rose and fell at the same hours as at lower elevations; the\r\ntide amounting to 0·060 inch, between 9.50 a.m. and 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nI left Tungu on the 30th of July, and spent that night at Tallum; where\r\na large party of men had just arrived, with loads of madder, rice,\r\ncanes, bamboos, planks, etc., to be conveyed to Tibet on yaks and\r\nponies.[210] On the following day I descended to Lamteng, gathering a\r\nprofusion of fine plants by the way.\r\n\r\n [210] About 300 loads of timber, each of six planks, are said to be\r\n taken across the Kongra Lama pass annually; and about 250 of rice,\r\n besides canes, madder, bamboos, cottons, cloths, and _Symplocos_\r\n leaves for dyeing. This is, no doubt, a considerably exaggerated\r\n statement, and may refer to both the Kongra Lama and Donkia passes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flat on which I had encamped at this place in May and June, being\r\nnow a marsh, I took up my abode for two days in one of the houses, and\r\npaid the usual penalty of communication with these filthy people; for\r\nwhich my only effectual remedy was boiling all my garments and bedding.\r\nYet the house was high, airy, and light; the walls composed of bamboo,\r\nlath, and plaster.\r\n\r\nTropical Cicadas ascend to the pine-woods above Lamteng in this month,\r\nand chirp shrilly in the heat of the day; and glow-worms fly about at\r\nnight. The common Bengal and Java toad, _Bufo scabra,_ abounded in the\r\nmarshes, a remarkable instance of wide geographical distribution, for a\r\nBatrachian which is common at the level of the sea under the tropics.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of August I descended to Choongtam, which I reached on the\r\n5th. The lakes on the Chateng flat (alt. 8,750 feet) were very full,\r\nand contained many English water-plants;[211] the temperature of the\r\nwater was 92° near the edges, where a water-insect (_Notonecta_) was\r\nswimming about.\r\n\r\n [211] _Sparganium ramosum, Eleocharis palustris, Scirpus triqueter,_\r\n and _Callitriche verna?_ Some very tropical genera ascend thus high;\r\n as _Paspalum_ amongst grasses, and _Scleria,_ a kind of sedge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow this I passed an extensive stalactitic deposit of lime, and a\r\nsecond occurred lower down, on the opposite side of the valley. The\r\napparently total absence of limestone rocks in any part of Sikkim (for\r\nwhich I made careful search), renders these deposits, which are far\r\nfrom unfrequent, very curious. Can the limestone, which appears in\r\nTibet, underlie the gneiss of Sikkim? We cannot venture to assume that\r\nthese lime-charged streams, which in Sikkim burst from the steep flanks\r\nof narrow mountain spurs, at elevations between 1000 and 7000 feet,\r\nhave any very remote or deep origin. If the limestone be not below the\r\ngneiss, it must either occur intercalated with it, or be the remains of\r\na formation now all but denuded in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nTerrific landslips had taken place along the valley, carrying down\r\nacres of rock, soil, and pine-forests, into the stream. I saw one from\r\nKampo Samdong, on the opposite flank of the valley, which swept over\r\n100 yards in breadth of forest. I looked in vain for any signs of\r\nscratching or scoring, at all comparable to that produced by glacial\r\naction. The bridge at the Tuktoong, mentioned at p. 31, being carried\r\naway, we had to ascend for 1000 feet (to a place where the river could\r\nbe crossed) by a very precipitous path, and descend on the opposite\r\nside. In many places we had great difficulty in proceeding, the track\r\nbeing obliterated by the rains, torrents, and landslips. Along the\r\nflats, now covered with a dense rank vegetation, we waded ankle, and\r\noften knee, deep in mud, swarming with leeches; and instead of\r\ndescending into the valley of the now too swollen Lachen, we made long\r\ndetours, rounding spurs by canes and bamboos suspended from trees.\r\n\r\nAt Choongtam the rice-fields were flooded: and the whole flat was a\r\nmarsh, covered with tropical grasses and weeds, and alive with insects,\r\nwhile the shrill cries of cicadas, frogs and birds, filled the air.\r\nSand-flies, mosquitos, cockroaches, and enormous cockchafers,[212]\r\n_Mantis,_ great locusts, grasshoppers, flying-bugs, crickets, ants,\r\nspiders, caterpillars, and leeches, were but a few of the pests that\r\nswarmed in my tent and made free with my bed. Great lazy butterflies\r\nfloated through the air; _Thecla_ and _Hesperides_ skipped about, and\r\nthe great _Nymphalidæ_ darted around like swallows. The venomous black\r\ncobra was common, and we left the path with great caution, as it is a\r\nlazy reptile, and lies basking in the sun; many beautiful and harmless\r\ngreen snakes, four feet long, glided amongst the bushes. My dogs caught\r\na “Rageu,”[213] a very remarkable animal, half goat and half deer; the\r\nflesh was good and tender, dark-coloured, and lean.\r\n\r\n [212] _Eucerris Griffithii,_ a magnificent species. Three very\r\n splendid insects of the outer ranges of Sikkim never occurred in the\r\n interior: these are a gigantic Curculio (_Calandra_) a wood-borer; a\r\n species of Goliath-beetle, _Cheirotonus Macleaii,_ and a smaller\r\n species of the same rare family, _Trigonophorus nepalensis_; of these\r\n the former is very scarce, the latter extremely abundant, flying about\r\n at evenings; both are flower-feeders, eating honey and pollen. In the\r\n summer of 1848, the months at Dorjiling were well marked by the swarms\r\n of peculiar insects that appeared in inconceivable numbers; thus,\r\n April was marked by a great black _Passalus,_ a beetle one-and-a-half\r\n inch long, that flies in the face and entangles itself in the hair;\r\n May, by stag-beetles and longicorns; June, by _Coccinella_\r\n (lady-birds), white moths, and flying-bugs; July, by a _Dryptis?_ a\r\n long-necked carabideous insect; August, by myriads of earwigs,\r\n cockroaches, Goliath-beetles, and cicadas; September, by spiders.\r\n\r\n\r\n [213] “Ragoah,” according to Hodgson: but it is not the _Procapra\r\n picticaudata_ of Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\nI remained here till the 15th of August,[214] arranging my Lachen\r\nvalley collections previous to starting for the Lachoong, whence I\r\nhoped to reach Tibet again by a different route, crossing the Donkia\r\npass, and thence exploring the sources of the Teesta at the Cholamoo\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\n [214] Though 5° further north, and 5,268 feet above the level of\r\n Calcutta, the mean temperature at Choongtam this month was only 12·5°\r\n cooler than at Calcutta; forty observations giving 1° Fahr. as equal\r\n to 690 feet of elevation; whereas in May the mean of twenty-seven\r\n observations gave 1° Fahr. as equal to 260 feet, the mean difference\r\n of temperature being then 25°. The mean maximum of the day was 80°,\r\n and was attained at 11 a.m., after which clouds formed, and the\r\n thermometer fell to 66° at sunset, and 56° at night. In my blanket\r\n tent the heat rose to upwards of 100° in calm weather. The afternoons\r\n were generally squally and rainy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst here I ascertained the velocity of the currents of the Lachen\r\nand Lachoong rivers. Both were torrents, than which none could be more\r\nrapid, short of becoming cataracts: the rains were at their height, and\r\nthe melting of the snows at its maximum. I first measured several\r\nhundred yards along the banks of each river above the bridges,\r\nrepeating this several times, as the rocks and jungle rendered it very\r\ndifficult to do it accurately: then, sitting on the bridge, I timed\r\nfloating masses of different materials and sizes that were thrown in at\r\nthe upper point. I was surprised to find the velocity of the Lachen\r\nonly nine miles per hour, for its waters seemed to shoot past with the\r\nspeed of an arrow, but the floats showed the whole stream to be so\r\ntroubled with local eddies and backwaters, that it took from\r\nforty-three to forty-eight seconds for each float to pass over 200\r\nyards, as it was perpetually submerged by under-currents. The breadth\r\nof the river averaged sixty-eight feet, and the discharge was 4,420\r\ncubic feet of water per second. The temperature was 57°.\r\n\r\nAt the Lachoong bridge the jungle was still denser, and the banks quite\r\ninaccessible in many places. The mean velocity was eight miles an hour,\r\nthe breadth ninety-five feet, the depth about the same as that of the\r\nLachen, giving a discharge of 5,700 cubic feet of water per\r\nsecond;[215] its temperature was also 57°. These streams retain an\r\nextraordinary velocity, for many miles upwards; the Lachen to its\r\njunction with the Zemu at 9000 feet, and the Zemu itself as far up as\r\nthe Thlonok, at 10,000 feet, and the Lachoong to the village of that\r\nname, at 8000 feet: their united streams appear equally rapid till they\r\nbecome the Teesta at Singtam.[216]\r\n\r\n [215] Hence it appears that the Lachoong, being so much the more\r\n copious stream, should in one sense be regarded as the continuation of\r\n the Teesta, rather than the Lachen, which, however, has by far the\r\n most distant source. Their united streams discharge upwards of 10,000\r\n cubic feet of water per second in the height of the rains! which is,\r\n however, a mere fraction of the discharge of the Teesta when that\r\n river leaves the Himalaya. The Ganges at Hurdwar discharges 8000 feet\r\n per second during the dry season.\r\n\r\n\r\n [216] The slope of the bed of the Lachen from below the confluence of\r\n the Zemu to the village of Singtam is 174 feet per mile, or 1 foot in\r\n 30; that of the Lachoong from the village of that name to Singtam is\r\n considerably less.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of August, having received supplies from Dorjiling, I\r\nstarted up the north bank of the Lachoong, following the Singtam\r\nSoubah, who accompanied me officially, and with a very bad grace; poor\r\nfellow, he expected me to have returned with him to Singtam, and thence\r\ngone back to Dorjiling, and many a sore struggle we had on this point.\r\nAt Choongtam he had been laid up with ulcerated legs from the bites of\r\nleeches and sand-flies, which required my treatment. The path was\r\nnarrow, and ran through a jungle of mixed tropical and temperate\r\nplants,[217] many of which are not found at this elevation on the damp\r\nouter ranges of Dorjiling. We crossed to the south bank by a fine\r\ncane-bridge forty yards long, the river being twenty-eight across and\r\nhere I have to record the loss of my dog Kinchin; the companion of all\r\nmy late journeyings, and to whom I had become really attached. He had a\r\nbad habit, of which I had vainly tried to cure him, of running for a\r\nfew yards on the round bamboos by which the cane-bridges are crossed,\r\nand on which it was impossible for a dog to retain his footing: in this\r\nsituation he used to get thoroughly frightened, and lie down on the\r\nbamboos with his legs hanging over the water, and having no hold\r\nwhatever. I had several times rescued him from this perilous position,\r\nwhich was always rendered more imminent from the shaking of the bridge\r\nas I approached him. On the present occasion, I stopped at the foot of\r\nsome rocks below the bridge, botanizing, and Kinchin having scrambled\r\nup the rocks, ran on to the bridge. I could not see him, and was not\r\nthinking about him, when suddenly his shrill, short barks of terror\r\nrang above the roaring torrent. I hastened to the bridge, but before I\r\ncould get to it, he had lost his footing, and had disappeared. Holding\r\non by the cane, I strained my eyes till the bridge seemed to be\r\nswimming up the valley, and the swift waters to be standing still, but\r\nto no purpose; he had been carried under at once, and swept away miles\r\nbelow. For many days I missed him by my side on the mountain, and by my\r\nfeet in camp. He had become a very handsome dog, with glossy black\r\nhair, pendent triangular ears, short muzzle, high forehead, jet-black\r\neyes, straight limbs, arched neck, and a most glorious tail curling\r\nover his back.[218]\r\n\r\n [217] As _Paris, Dipsacus, Circæa, Thalictrum, Saxifraga ciliaris,\r\n Spiranthes, Malva, Hypoxis, Anthericum, Passiflora, Drosera,\r\n Didymocarpus,_ poplar, _Calamagrostis,_ and _Eupatorium._\r\n\r\n\r\n [218] The woodcut at vol. i. p. 203, gives the character of the Tibet\r\n mastiff, to which breed his father belonged; but it is not a portrait\r\n of himself, having been sketched from a dog of the pure breed, in the\r\n Zoological Society’s Gardens, by C. Jenyns, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very bad road led to the village of Keadom, situated on a flat\r\nterrace several hundred feet above the river, and 6,609 feet above the\r\nsea, where I spent the night. Here are cultivated plantains and maize,\r\nalthough the elevation is equal to parts of Dorjiling, where these\r\nplants do not ripen.\r\n\r\nThe river above Keadom is again crossed, by a plank bridge, at a place\r\nwhere the contracted streams flow between banks forty feet high,\r\ncomposed of obscurely stratified gravel, sand, and water-worn boulders.\r\nAbove this the path ascends lofty flat-topped spurs, which overhang the\r\nriver, and command some of the most beautiful scenery in Sikkim. The\r\nsouth-east slopes are clothed with _Abies Brunoniana_ at 8000 feet\r\nelevation, and cleft by a deep ravine, from which projects what appears\r\nto be an old moraine, fully 1,500 or perhaps 2000 feet high. Extensive\r\nlandslips on its steep flank expose (through the telescope) a mass of\r\ngravel and angular blocks, while streams cut deep channels in it.\r\n\r\nThis valley is far more open and grassy than that of the Lachen, and\r\nthe vegetation also differs much.[219] In the afternoon we reached\r\nLachoong, which is by far the most picturesque village in the temperate\r\nregion of Sikkim. Grassy flats of different levels, sprinkled with\r\nbrushwood and scattered clumps of pine and maple, occupy the valley;\r\nwhose west flanks rise in steep, rocky, and scantily wooded grassy\r\nslopes. About five miles to the north the valley forks; two conspicuous\r\ndomes of snow rising from the intermediate mountains. The eastern\r\nvalley leads to lofty snowed regions, and is said to be impracticable;\r\nthe Lachoong flows down the western, which appeared rugged, and covered\r\nwith pine woods. On the east, Tunkra mountain[220] rises in a superb\r\nunbroken sweep of dark pine-wood and cliffs, surmounted by black rocks\r\nand white fingering peaks of snow. South of this, the valley of the\r\nTunkrachoo opens, backed by sharp snowed pinnacles, which form the\r\ncontinuation of the Chola range; over which a pass leads to the Phari\r\ndistrict of Tibet, which intervenes between Sikkim and Bhotan.\r\nSouthwards the view is bounded by snowy mountains, and the valley seems\r\nblocked up by the remarkable moraine-like spur which I passed above\r\nKeadom.\r\n\r\n [219] _Umbelliferæ_ and _Compositæ_ abound, and were then flowering;\r\n and an orchis (_Satyrium Nepalense_), scented like our English\r\n _Gymnadenia,_ covered the ground in some places, with tall green\r\n _Habenariæ_ and a yellow _Spathoglottis,_ a genus with pseudo-bulbs.\r\n Of shrubs, _Xanthoxylon, Rhus, Prinsepia, Cotoneaster, Pyrus,_ poplar\r\n and oak, formed thickets along the path; while there were as many as\r\n eight and nine kinds of balsams, some eight feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\n [220] This mountain is seen from Dorjiling; its elevation is about\r\n 18,700 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lachoong valley and village, looking south]\r\n\r\nStupendous moraines rise 1,500 feet above the Lachoong in several\r\nconcentric series, curving downwards and outwards, so as to form a\r\nbell-shaped mouth to the valley of the Tunkrachoo. Those on the upper\r\nflank are much the largest; and the loftiest of them terminates in a\r\nconical hill crowned with Boodhist flags, and its steep sides cut into\r\nhorizontal roads or terraces, one of which is so broad and flat as to\r\nsuggest the idea of its having been cleared by art.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lofty ancient moraines in the Lachoong valley, looking\r\nsouth-east]\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the Tunkrachoo river the moraines are also more or\r\nless terraced, as is the, floor of the Lachoong valley, and its east\r\nslopes, 1000 feet up.[221]\r\n\r\n [221] I have since been greatly struck with the similarity between the\r\n features of this valley, and those of Chamouni (though the latter is\r\n on a smaller scale) above the Lavanchi moraine. The spectator standing\r\n in the expanded part below the village of Argentiere, and looking\r\n upwards, sees the valley closed above by the ancient moraine of the\r\n Argentiere glacier, and below by that of Lavanchi; and an all sides\r\n the slopes are cut into terraces, strewed with boulders. I found\r\n traces of stratified pebbles and sand on the north flank of the\r\n Lavanchi moraine however, which I failed to discover in those of\r\n Lachoong. The average slope of these pine-clad Sikkim valleys much\r\n approximates to that of Chamouni, and never approaches the precipitous\r\n character of the Bernese Alps’ valleys, Kandersteg, Lauterbrunnen, and\r\n Grindelwald.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river is fourteen yards broad, and neither deep nor rapid: the\r\nvillage is on the east bank, and is large for Sikkim; it contains fully\r\n100 good wooden houses, raised on posts, and clustered together without\r\norder. It was muddy and intolerably filthy, and intersected by some\r\nsmall streams, whose beds formed the roads, and, at the same time, the\r\ncommon sewers of the natives. There is some wretched cultivation in\r\nfields,[222] of wheat, barley, peas, radishes, and turnips. Rice was\r\nonce cultivated at this elevation (8000 feet), but the crop was\r\nuncertain; some very tropical grasses grow wild here, as _Eragrostis_\r\nand _Panicum._ In gardens the hollyhock is seen: it is said to be\r\nintroduced through Tibet from China; also _Pinus excelsa_ from Bhotan,\r\npeaches, walnuts, and weeping willows. A tall poplar was pointed out to\r\nme as a great wonder; it had two species of _Pyrus_ growing on its\r\nboughs, evidently from seed; one was a mountain ash, the other like\r\n_Pyrus Aria._\r\n\r\n [222] Full of such English weeds as shepherd’s purse, nettles,\r\n _Solanum nigrum,_ and dock; besides many Himalayan ones, as balsams,\r\n thistles, a beautiful geranium, mallow, _Haloragis_ and Cucurbitaceous\r\n plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after camping, the Lachoong Phipun, a very tall, intelligent, and\r\nagreeable looking man, waited on me with the usual presents, and a\r\nrequest that I would visit his sick father. His house was lofty and\r\nairy: in the inner room the sick man was stretched on a board, covered\r\nwith a blanket, and dying of pressure on the brain; he was surrounded\r\nby a deputation of Lamas from Teshoo Loombo, sent for in this\r\nemergency. The principal one was a fat fellow, who sat cross-legged\r\nbefore a block-printed Tibetan book, plates of raw meat, rice, and\r\nother offerings, and the bells, dorje, etc. of his profession. Others\r\nsat around, reading or chanting services, and filling the room with\r\nincense. At one end of the apartment was a good library in a\r\nbeautifully carved book-case.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Head and feet of Tibet marmot]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\n\r\nLeave Lachoong for Tunkra pass—Moraines and their vegetation—Pines of\r\ngreat dimensions—Wild currants—Glaciers—Summit of\r\npass—Elevation—Views—Plants—Winds—Choombi district—Lacheepia\r\nrock—Extreme cold—Kinchinjunga—Himalayan grouse—Meteorological\r\nobservations—Return to Lachoong—Oaks—Ascent to Yeumtong—Flats and\r\ndebacles—Buried pine-trunks—Perpetual snow—Hot springs—Behaviour of\r\nSingtam Soubah—Leave for Momay Samdong—Upper limit of\r\ntrees—Distribution of plants—Glacial terraces, etc.—Forked\r\nDonkia—Moutonnéed rocks—Ascent to Donkia\r\npass—Vegetation—Scenery—Lakes—Tibet—Bhomtso—Arun river—Kiang-lah\r\nmountains—Yaru-Tsampu river—Appearance of\r\nTibet—Kambajong—Jigatzi—Kinchinjhow, and Kinchinjunga—Chola\r\nrange—Deceptive appearance of distant landscape—Perpetual\r\nsnow—Granite—Temperatures—Pulses—Plants—Tripe de roche—Return to\r\nMomay—Dogs and yaks—Birds—Insects—Quadrupeds—Hot\r\nsprings—Marmots—Kinchinjhow glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Singtam Soubah being again laid up here from the consequences of\r\nleech-bites, I took the opportunity of visiting the Tunkra-lah pass,\r\nrepresented as the most snowy in Sikkim; which I found to be the case.\r\nThe route lay over the moraines on the north flank of the Tunkrachoo,\r\nwhich are divided by narrow dry gullies,[223] and composed of enormous\r\nblocks disintegrating into a deep layer of clay. All are clothed with\r\nluxuriant herbage and flowering shrubs,[224] besides small larches and\r\npines, rhododendrons and maples; with _Enkianthus, Pyrus,_ cherry,\r\n_Pieris,_ laurel, and _Goughia._ The musk-deer inhabits these woods,\r\nand at this season I have never seen it higher. Large monkeys are also\r\nfound on the skirts of the pine-forests, and the _Ailurus ochraceus_\r\n(Hodgs.), a curious long-tailed animal peculiar to the Himalaya,\r\nsomething between a diminutive bear and a squirrel. In the dense and\r\ngigantic forest of _Abies Brunoniana_ and silver fir, I measured one of\r\nthe former trees, and found it twenty-eight feet in girth, and above\r\n120 feet in height. The _Abies Webbiana_ attains thirty-five feet in\r\ngirth, with a trunk unbranched for forty feet.\r\n\r\n [223] These ridges of the moraine, separated by gullies, indicate the\r\n progressive retirement of the ancient glacier, after periods of rest.\r\n The same phenomena may be seen, on a diminutive scale, in the Swiss\r\n Alps, by any one who carefully examines the lateral and often the\r\n terminal moraines of any retiring or diminishing glacier, at whose\r\n base or flanks are concentric ridges, which are successive deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n [224] _Ranunculus, Clematis, Thalictrum, Anemone, Aconitum variegatum_\r\n of Europe, a scandent species, Berberry, _Deutzia, Philadelphus,_\r\n Rose, Honeysuckle, Thistles, Orchis, _Habenaria, Fritillaria, Aster,\r\n Calimeris, Verbascum thapsus, Pedicularis, Euphrasia, Senecio,\r\n Eupatorium, Dipsacus, Euphorbia,_ Balsam, _Hypericum, Gentiana,\r\n Halenia, Codonopsis, Polygonum._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe path was narrow and difficult in the wood, and especially along the\r\nbed of the stream, where grew ugly trees of larch, eighty feet high,\r\nand abundance of a new species of alpine strawberry with oblong fruit.\r\nAt 11,560 feet elevation, I arrived at an immense rock of gneiss,\r\nburied in the forest. Here currant-bushes were plentiful, generally\r\ngrowing on the pine-trunks, in strange association with a small species\r\nof _Begonia,_ a hothouse tribe of plants in England. Emerging from the\r\nforest, vast old moraines are crossed, in a shallow mountain valley,\r\nseveral miles long and broad, 12,000 feet above the sea, choked with\r\nrhododendron shrubs, and nearly encircled by snowy mountains.\r\nMagnificent gentians grew here, also _Senecio, Corydalis,_ and the\r\n_Aconitum luridum_ (n. sp.), whose root is said to be as virulent as\r\n_A. ferox_ and _A. Napellus._[225] The plants were all fully a month\r\nbehind those of the Lachen valley at the same elevation. Heavy rain\r\nfell in the afternoon, and we halted under some rocks: as I had brought\r\nno tent, my bed was placed beneath the shelter of one, near which the\r\nrest of the party burrowed. I supped off half a yak’s kidney, an\r\nenormous organ in this animal.\r\n\r\n [225] The result of Dr. Thomson’s and my examination of the Himplayan\r\n aconites (of which there are seven species) is that the one generally\r\n known as _A. ferox,_ and which supplies a great deal of the celebrated\r\n poison, is the common _A. Napellus_ of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we proceeded up the valley, towards a very\r\nsteep rocky barrier, through which the river cut a narrow gorge, and\r\nbeyond which rose lofty snowy mountains: the peak of Tunkra being to\r\nour left hand (north). Saxifrages grew here in profuse tufts of golden\r\nblossoms, and _Chrysosplenium,_ rushes, mountain-sorrel (_Oxyria_), and\r\nthe bladder-headed _Saussurea,_ whose flowers are enclosed in inflated\r\nmembranous bracts, and smell like putrid meat: there were also splendid\r\nprimroses, the spikenard valerian, and golden Potentillas.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was steep and difficult, up a stony valley bounded by\r\nprecipices; in this the river flowed in a north-west direction, and we\r\nwere obliged to wade along it, though its waters were bitterly cold,\r\nthe temperature being 39°. At 15,000 feet we passed from great snowbeds\r\nto the surface of a glacier, partly an accumulation of snow, increased\r\nby lateral glaciers: its slope was very gentle for several miles; the\r\nsurface was eroded by rain, and very rough, whilst those of the lateral\r\nglaciers were ribboned, crevassed, and often conspicuously marked with\r\ndirt-bands.\r\n\r\nA gently sloping saddle, bare of snow, which succeeds the glacier,\r\nforms the top of the Tunkra pass; it unites two snowy mountains, and\r\nopens on the great valley of the Machoo, which flows in a part of Tibet\r\nbetween Sikkim and Bhotan; its height is 16,083 feet above the sea by\r\nbarometer, and 16,137 feet by boiling-point. Nothing can be more\r\ndifferent than the two slopes of this pass; that by which I had come\r\npresented a gentle snowy acclivity, bounded by precipitous mountains;\r\nwhile that which opened before me was a steep, rocky, broad, grassy\r\nvalley, where not a particle of snow was to be seen, and yaks were\r\nfeeding near a small lake not 1000 feet down. Nor were snowy mountains\r\nvisible anywhere in this direction, except far to the south-east, in\r\nBhotan. This remarkable difference of climate is due to the southerly\r\nwind which ascends the Tibetan or Machoo valley being drained by\r\nintervening mountains before reaching this pass, whilst the Sikkim\r\ncurrent brings abundant vapours up the Teesta and Lachoong valleys.\r\n\r\nChumulari lies to the E.N.E. of the Tunkra pass, and is only twenty-six\r\nmiles distant, but not seen; Phari is two marches off, in an easterly\r\ndirection, and Choombi one to the south-east. Choombi is the general\r\nname given to a large Tibetan province that embraces the head of the\r\nMachoo river, and includes Phari, Eusa, Choombi, and about thirteen\r\nother villages, corresponding to as many districts, that contain from\r\nunder a dozen to 300 houses each, varying with the season and state of\r\ntrade. The latter is considerable, Phari being, next to Dorjiling, the\r\ngreatest Tibetan, Bhotan, Sikkim, and Indian entrepôt along the whole\r\nHimalaya east of Nepal. The general form of Choombi valley is\r\ntriangular, the broader end northwards: it is bounded by the Chola\r\nrange on the west from Donkia to Gipmoochi, and by the Kamphee or\r\nChakoong range to the east; which is, I believe, continuous with\r\nChumulari. These meridional ranges approximate to the southward, so as\r\nto form a natural boundary to Choombi. The Machoo river, rising from\r\nChumulari, flows through the Choombi district, and enters Bhotan at a\r\nlarge mart called Rinchingoong, whence it flows to the plains of India,\r\nwhere it is called at Couch-Behar, the Torsha, or, as some say, the\r\nGodadda, and falls into the Burrampooter.\r\n\r\nThe Choombi district is elevated, for the only cultivation is a summer\r\nor alpine one, neither rice, maize, nor millet being grown there: it is\r\nalso dry, for the great height of the Bhotan mountains and the form of\r\nthe Machou valley cut off the rains, and there is no dense forest. It\r\nis very mountainous, all carriage being on men’s and yaks’ backs, and\r\nis populous for this part of the country, the inhabitants being\r\nestimated at 3000, in the trading season, when many families from Tibet\r\nand Bhotan erect booths at Phari.\r\n\r\nA civil officer at Phari collects the revenue under the Lhassan\r\nauthorities, and there is also a Tibetan fort, an officer, and guard.\r\nThe inhabitants of this district more resemble the Bhotanese than\r\nTibetans, and are a thievish set, finding a refuge under the Paro-Pilo\r\nof Bhotan,[226] who taxes the refugees according to the estimate he\r\nforms of their plunder. The Tibetans seldom pursue the culprits, as the\r\nLhassan government avoids all interference south of their own frontier.\r\n\r\n [226] There was once a large monastery, called Kazioo Goompa, at\r\n Choombi, with upwards of one hundred Lamas. During a struggle between\r\n the Sikkim and Bhotan monks for superiority in it, the abbot died. His\r\n avatar reappeared in two places at once! in Bhotan as a relative of\r\n the Paro-Pilo himself, and in Sikkim as a brother of the powerful\r\n Gangtok Kajee. Their disputes were referred to the Dalai Lama, who\r\n pronounced for Sikkim. This was not to be disputed by the Pilo, who,\r\n however, plundered the Goompa of its silver, gold, and books, leaving\r\n nothing but the bare walls for the successful Lama! The Lhassan\r\n authorities made no attempt to obtain restitution, and the monastery\r\n has been consequently neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Choombi to Lhassa is fifteen days’ long journeys for a man mounted\r\non a stout mule; all the rice passing through Phari is monopolised\r\nthere for the Chinese troops at Lhassa. The grazing for yaks and small\r\ncattle is excellent in Choombi, and the _Pinus excelsa_ is said to grow\r\nabundantly there, though unknown in Sikkim, but I have not heard of any\r\nother peculiarity in its productions.\r\n\r\nVery few plants grew amongst the stones at the top of the Tunkra pass,\r\nand those few were mostly quite different from those of Palung and\r\nKongra Lama. A pink-flowered _Arenaria,_ two kinds of _Corydalis,_ the\r\ncottony _Saussurea,_ and diminutive primroses, were the most\r\nconspicuous.[227] The wind was variable, blowing alternately up both\r\nvalleys, bringing much snow when it blew from the Teesta, though\r\ndeflected to a north-west breeze; when, on the contrary, it blew from\r\nTibet, it was, though southerly, dry. Clouds obscured all distant view.\r\nThe temperature varied between noon and 1.30 p.m. from 39° to 40·5°,\r\nthe air being extremely damp.\r\n\r\n [227] The only others were _Leontopodium, Sedum,_ Saxifrage,\r\n _Ramunculus hyperboreus, Ligularia,_ two species of _Polygonum,_ a\r\n _Trichostomum, Stereocaulon,_ and _Lecidea geographica,_ not one grass\r\n or sedge.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the foot of the glacier, I took up my quarters for two\r\ndays under an enormous rock overlooking the broad flat valley in which\r\nI had spent the previous night, and directly fronting Tunkra mountain,\r\nwhich bore north about five miles distant. This rock was sixty to\r\neighty feet high, and 15,250 feet above the sea; it was of gneiss, and\r\nwas placed on the top of a bleak ridge, facing the north; no shrub or\r\nbush being near it. The gentle slope outwards of the rock afforded the\r\nonly shelter, and a more utterly desolate place than Lacheepia, as it\r\nis called, I never laid my unhoused head in. It commanded an\r\nincomparable view due west across the Lachoong and Lachen valleys, of\r\nthe whole group of Kinchinjunga snows, from Tibet southwards, and as\r\nsuch was a most valuable position for geographical purposes.\r\n\r\nThe night was misty, and though the temperature was 35°, I was\r\nmiserably cold; for my blankets being laid on the bare ground, the\r\nchill seemed to strike from the rock to the very marrow of my bones. In\r\nthe morning the fog hung till sunrise, when it rose majestically from\r\nall the mountain-tops; but the view obtained was transient, for in less\r\nthan an hour the dense woolly banks of fog which choked the valleys\r\nascended like a curtain to the warmed atmosphere above, and slowly\r\nthrew a veil over the landscape. I waited till the last streak of snow\r\nwas shut out from my view, when I descended, to breakfast on Himalayan\r\ngrouse (_Tetrao-perdix nivicola_), a small gregarious bird which\r\ninhabits the loftiest stony mountains, and utters a short cry of\r\n“Quiok, quiok;” in character and appearance it is intermediate between\r\ngrouse and partridge, and is good eating, though tough.\r\n\r\nHoping to obtain another view, which might enable me to correct the\r\nbearings taken that morning, I was tempted to spend a second night in\r\nthe open air at Lacheepia, passing the day botanizing[228] in the\r\nvicinity, and taking observations of the barometer and wet-bulb: I also\r\nboiled three thermometers by turns, noting the grave errors likely to\r\nattend observations of this instrument for elevation.[229] Little rain\r\nfell during the day, but it was heavy at night, though there was\r\nfortunately no wind; and I made a more comfortable bed with tufts of\r\njuniper brought up from below. Our fire was principally of wet\r\nrhododendron wood, with masses of the aromatic dwarf species, which,\r\nbeing full of resinous glands, blazed with fury. Next day, after a very\r\ntransient glimpse of the Kinchinjunga snows, I descended to Lachoong,\r\nwhere I remained for some days botanizing. During my stay I was several\r\ntimes awakened by all the noises and accompaniments of a night-attack\r\nor alarm; screaming voices, groans, shouts, and ejaculations, the\r\nbeating of drums and firing of guns, and flambeaux of pine-wood\r\ngleaming amongst the trees, and flitting from house to house. The\r\ncause, I was informed, was the, presence of a demon, who required\r\nexorcisement, and who generally managed to make the villagers remember\r\nhis visit, by their missing various articles after the turmoil made to\r\ndrive him away. The custom of driving out demons in the above manner is\r\nconstantly practised by the Lamas in Tibet: MM. Huc and Gabet give a\r\ngraphic account of such an operation during their stay at Kounboum.\r\n\r\n [228] Scarcely a grass, and no _Astragali,_ grow on these stony and\r\n snowy slopes: and the smallest heath-like _Andromeda,_ a still smaller\r\n _Menziesia_ (an erotic genus, previously unknown in the Himalaya) and\r\n a prostrate willow, are the only woody-stemmed plants above 15,000\r\n feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [229] These will be more particularly alluded to in the Appendix,\r\n where will be found a comparison of elevations, deduced from boiling\r\n point and from barometric observations. The height of Lacheepia is\r\n 14,912 feet by boiling-point, and 15,262 feet by barometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of August I left Lachoong and proceeded up the valley. The\r\nroad ran along a terrace, covered with long grass, and bounded by lofty\r\nbanks of unstratified gravel and sand, and passed through beautiful\r\ngroves of green pines, rich in plants. No oak nor chesnut ascends above\r\n9000 feet here or elsewhere in the interior of Sikkim, where they are\r\nreplaced by a species of hazel (_Corylus_); in the North Himalaya, on\r\nthe other hand, an oak (_Quercus semecarpifolia,_ see vol. i., p. 187)\r\nis amongst the most alpine trees, and the nut is a different species,\r\nmore resembling the European. On the outer Sikkim ranges oaks (_Q.\r\nannulata?_) ascend to 10,000 feet, and there is no hazel. Above the\r\nfork, the valley contracts extremely, and its bed is covered with\r\nmoraines and landslips, which often bury the larches and pines. Marshes\r\noccur here and there, full of the sweet-scented Hierochlœ grass, the\r\nScotch _Thalictrum alpinum,_ and an _Eriocaulon,_ which ascends to\r\n10,000 feet. The old moraines were very difficult to cross, and on one\r\nI found a barricade, which had been erected to deceive me regarding the\r\nfrontier, had I chosen this route instead of the Lachen one, in May.\r\n\r\nBroad flats clothed with rhododendron, alternate with others covered\r\nwith mud, boulders, and gravel, which had flowed down from the gorges\r\non the west, and which still contained trees, inclined in all\r\ndirections, and buried up to their branches; some of these débâcles\r\nwere 400 yards across, and sloped at an angle of 2° to 3°, bearing on\r\ntheir surfaces blocks fifteen yards in diameter.[230] They seem to\r\nsubside materially, as I perceived they had left marks many feet higher\r\non the tree-trunks. Such débâcles must often bury standing forests in a\r\nvery favourable material, climate, and position for becoming\r\nfossilized.\r\n\r\n [230] None were to be compared in size and extent with that at Bex, at\r\n the mouth of the Rhone valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of August I arrived at Yeumtong, a small summer\r\ncattle-station, on a flat by the Lachoong, 11,920 feet above the sea;\r\nthe general features of which closely resemble those of the narrow\r\nSwiss valleys. The west flank is lofty and precipitous, with narrow\r\ngullies still retaining the winter’s snow, at 12,500 feet; the east\r\ngradually slopes up to the two snowy domes seen from Lachoong; the bed\r\nof the valley is alternately a flat lake-bed, in which the river\r\nmeanders at the rate of three and a half miles an hour, and sudden\r\ndescents, cumbered with old moraines, over which it rushes in sheets of\r\nLoam. Silver-firs ascend nearly to 13,000 feet, where they are replaced\r\nby large junipers, sixty feet high: up the valley Chango Khang is seen,\r\nwith a superb glacier descending to about 14,000 feet on its south\r\nflank. Enormous masses of rock were continually precipitated from the\r\nwest side, close to the shed in which I had taken up my quarters,\r\nkeeping my people in constant alarm, and causing a great commotion\r\namong the yaks, dogs, and ponies. On the opposite side of the river is\r\na deep gorge; in which an immense glacier descends lower than any I\r\nhave seen in Sikkim. I made several attempts to reach it by the gully\r\nof its discharging stream, but was always foiled by the rocks and dense\r\njungle of pines, rhododendron, and dwarf holly.\r\n\r\nThe snow-banks on the face of the dome-shaped mountain appearing\r\nfavourable for ascertaining the position of the level of perpetual\r\nsnow, I ascended to them on the 6th of September, and found the mean\r\nelevation along an even, continuous, and gradual slope, with a full\r\nsouth-west exposure, to be 15,985 feet by barometer, and 15,816 feet by\r\nboiling-point. These beds of snow, however broad and convex, cannot\r\nnevertheless be distinguished from glaciers: they occupy, it is true,\r\nmountain slopes, and do not fill hollows (like glaciers commonly so\r\ncalled), but they display the ribboned structure of ice, and being\r\nviscous fluids, descend at a rate and to a distance depending on the\r\nslope, and on the amount of annual accumulation behind. Their\r\ntermination must therefore be far below that point at which all the\r\nsnow that falls melts, which is the theoretical line of perpetual snow.\r\nBefore returning I attempted to proceed northwards to the great\r\nglacier, hoping to descend by its lateral moraine, but a heavy\r\nsnow-storm drove me down to Yeumtong.\r\n\r\nSome hot-springs burst from the bank of the Lachen a mile or so below\r\nthe village: they are used as baths, the patient remaining three days\r\nat a time in them, only retiring to eat in a little shed close by. The\r\ndischarge amounts to a few gallons per minute; the temperature at the\r\nsource is 112·6°, and 106° in the bath.[231] The water has a slightly\r\nsaline taste; it is colourless, but emits bubbles of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen gas, blackening silver. A cold spring (temperature 42°)\r\nemerged close by, and the Lachoong not ten yards off, was 47° to 50°. A\r\nconferva grows in the hot water, and the garnets are worn out of the\r\ngneiss rock exposed to its action.\r\n\r\n [231] This water boiled at 191·6°, the same at which snow-water and\r\n that of the river did; giving an elevation of 11,730 feet.\r\n Observations on the mineral constituents of the water will be found in\r\n the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Singtam Soubah had been very sulky since leaving Choongtam, and I\r\ncould scarcely get a drop of milk or a slice of curd here. I had to\r\ntake him to task severely for sanctioning the flogging of one of my\r\nmen; a huntsman, who had offered me his services at Choongtam, and who\r\nwas a civil, industrious fellow, though he had procured me little\r\nbesides a huge monkey, which had nearly bitten off the head of his best\r\ndog. I had made a point of consulting the Soubah before hiring him, for\r\nfear of accidents; but this did not screen him from the jealousy of the\r\nChoongtam Lama, who twice flogged him in the Goompa with rattans (with\r\nthe Soubah’s consent), alleging that he had quitted his service for\r\nmine. My people knew of this, but were afraid to tell me, which the\r\npoor fellow did himself.\r\n\r\nThe Lachoong Phipun visited me on the 7th of September: he had\r\nofficiously been in Tibet to hear what the Tibetan people would say to\r\nmy going to Donkia, and finding them supremely indifferent, returned to\r\nbe my guide. A month’s provision for ten men having arrived from\r\nDorjiling, I left Yeumtong the following day for Momay Samdong, the\r\nloftiest yak grazing station in Sikkim (Palung being too cold for\r\nyaks), and within a day’s journey of the Donkia pass.\r\n\r\nThe valley remains almost level for several miles, the road continuing\r\nalong the east bank of the Lachen. Shoots of stones descend from the\r\nravines, all of a white fine-grained granite, stained red with a minute\r\nconferva, which has been taken by Himalayan travellers for red\r\nsnow;[232] a phenomenon I never saw in Sikkim.\r\n\r\n [232] Red snow was never found in the Antarctic regions during Sir\r\n James Ross’s South Polar voyage; nor do I know any authentic record of\r\n its having been seen in the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a fork of the valley several miles above Yeumtong, and below the\r\ngreat glacier of Chango Khang, the ancient moraines are prodigious,\r\nmuch exceeding any I have elsewhere seen, both in extent, in the size\r\nof the boulders, and in the height to which the latter are piled on one\r\nanother. Many boulders I measured were twenty yards across, and some\r\neven forty; and the chaotic scene they presented baffles all\r\ndescription: they were scantily clothed with stunted silver firs.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, the path crosses the river, and ascends rapidly over a\r\nmile of steeply sloping landslip, composed of angular fragments of\r\ngranite, that are constantly falling from above, and are extremely\r\ndangerous. At 14,000 feet, trees and shrubs cease, willow and\r\nhoneysuckle being the last; and thence onward the valley is bleak,\r\nopen, and stony, with lofty rocky mountains on either side. The south\r\nwind brought a cold drizzling rain, which numbed us, and two of the\r\nlads who had last come up from Dorjiling were seized with a remittent\r\nfever, originally contracted in the hot valleys; luckily we found some\r\ncattle-sheds, in which I left them, with two men to attend on them.\r\n\r\nMomay Samdong is situated in a broad part of the Lachoong valley, where\r\nthree streams meet; it is on the west of Chango Khang, and is six miles\r\nsouth-east of Kinchinjhow, and seven south-west of Donkia: it is in the\r\nsame latitude as Palung, but scarcely so lofty. The mean of fifty-six\r\nbarometrical observations contemporaneous with Calcutta makes it 15,362\r\nfeet above the sea; nearly the elevation of Lacheepia (near the Tunkra\r\npass), from which, however, its scenery and vegetation entirely differ.\r\n\r\nI pitched my tent close to a little shed, at the gently sloping base of\r\na mountain that divided the Lachoong river from a western tributary. It\r\nwas a wild and most exposed spot: long stony mountains, grassy on the\r\nbase near the river; distant snowy peaks, stupendous precipices,\r\nmoraines, glaciers, transported boulders, and rocks rounded by glacial\r\naction, formed the dismal landscape which everywhere met the view.\r\nThere was not a bush six inches high, and the only approach to woody\r\nplants were minute creeping willows and dwarf rhododendrons, with a\r\nvery few prostrate junipers and _Ephedra._\r\n\r\nThe base of the spur was cut into broad flat terraces, composed of\r\nunstratified sand, pebbles, and boulders; the remains, doubtless, of an\r\nenormously thick glacial deposit. The terracing is as difficult to be\r\naccounted for in this valley as in that of Yangma (East Nepal); both\r\nvalleys being far too broad, and descending too rapidly to admit of the\r\nhypothesis of their having been blocked up in the lower part, and the\r\nupper filled with large lakes.[233] Another tributary falls into the\r\nLachoong at Momay, which leads eastwards up to an enormous glacier that\r\ndescends from Donkia. Snowy mountains rise nearly all round it: those\r\non its south and east divide Sikkim from the Phari province in Tibet;\r\nthose on the north terminate in a forked or cleft peak, which is a\r\nremarkable and conspicuous feature from Momay. This, which I have\r\ncalled forked Donkia,[234] is the termination of a magnificent\r\namphitheatre of stupendous snow-clad precipices, continuously upwards\r\nof 20,000 feet high, that forms the east flank of the upper Lachoong.\r\nFrom Donkia top again, the mountains sweep round to the westward,\r\nrising into fingered peaks of extraordinary magnificence; and thence\r\n—still running west—dip to 18,500 feet, forming the Donkia pass, and\r\nrise again as the great mural mass of Kinchinjhow. This girdle of\r\nmountains encloses the head waters of the Lachoong, which rises in\r\ncountless streams from its perpetual snows, glaciers, and small lakes:\r\nits north drainage is to the Cholamoo lakes in Tibet; in which is the\r\nsource of the Lachen, which flows round the north base of Kinchinjhow\r\nto Kongra Lama.\r\n\r\n [233] The formation of small lakes, however, between moraines and the\r\n sides of the valleys they occupy, or between two successively formed\r\n moraines (as I have elsewhere mentioned), will account for very\r\n extensive terraced areas of this kind; and it must be borne in mind\r\n that when the Momay valley was filled with ice, the breadth of its\r\n glacier at this point must have been twelve miles, and it must have\r\n extended east and west from Chango Khang across the main valley, to\r\n beyond Donkia. Still the great moraines are wanting at this particular\r\n point, and though atmospheric action and the rivers have removed\r\n perhaps 200 feet of glacial shingle, they can hardly have destroyed a\r\n moraine of rocks, large enough to block up the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n [234] Its elevation by my observations is about 21,870 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the Lachoong valley at Momay is broad, tolerably level,\r\ngrassy, and covered with isolated mounds and ridges that point down the\r\nvalley, and are the remains of glacial deposits. It dips suddenly below\r\nthis, and some gneiss rocks that rise in its centre are remarkably\r\n_moutonnéed_ or rounded, and have boulders perched on their summits.\r\nThough manifestly rounded and grooved by ancient glaciers, I failed to\r\nfind scratches on these weather-worn rocks.[235]\r\n\r\n [235] I have repeatedly, and equally in vain, sought for scratchings\r\n on many of the most conspicuously moutonneed gneiss rocks of\r\n Switzerland. The retention of such markings depends on other\r\n circumstances than the mere hardness of the rock, or amount of aqueous\r\n action. What can be more astonishing than to see these most delicate\r\n scratches retained in all their sharpness on rocks clothed with\r\n seaweed and shells, and exposed at every tide, in the bays of western\r\n Scotland!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lachoong is here twelve or fifteen yards wide, and runs over a\r\npebbly bed, cutting a shallow channel through the deposits, down to the\r\nsubjacent rock, which is in some cases scooped out six or eight feet\r\ndeep by its waters. I do not doubt that the flatness of the floor of\r\nthe Momay valley is caused by the combined action of the streams that\r\ndrained the three glaciers which met here; for the tendency of retiring\r\nglaciers is to level the floors of valleys, by giving an ever-shifting\r\ndirection to the rivers which drain them, and which spread detritus in\r\ntheir course. Supposing these glaciers to have had no terminal\r\nmoraines, they might still have forced immense beds of gravel into\r\npositions that would dam up lakes between the ice and the flanks of the\r\nvalleys, and thus produce much terracing on the latter.[236]\r\n\r\n [236] We are still very ignorant of many details of ice action, and\r\n especially of the origin of many enormous deposits which are not true\r\n moraines. These, so conspicuous in the lofty Himalayan valleys, are\r\n not less so in those of the Swiss Alps: witness that broad valley in\r\n which Grindelwald village is situated, and which is covered to an\r\n immense depth with angular detritus, moulded into hills and valleys;\r\n also the whole broad open Upper Rhone valley, above the village of\r\n Munster, and below that of Obergestelen. The action of broad glaciers\r\n on gentle slopes is to raise their own beds by the accumulation of\r\n gravel which their lower surface carries and pushes forward. I have\r\n seen small glaciers thus raised 300 feet; leaving little doubt in my\r\n mind that the upper Himalayan valleys were thus choked with deposit\r\n 1000 feet thick, of which indeed the proofs remain along the flanks of\r\n the Yangma valley. The denuding and accumulating effects of ice thus\r\n give a contour to mountain valleys, and sculpture their flanks and\r\n floors far more rapidly than sea action, or the elements. After a very\r\n extensive experience of ice in the Antarctic ocean, and in mountainous\r\n countries, I cannot but conclude that very few of our geologists\r\n appreciate the power of ice as a mechanical agent, which can hardly be\r\n over-estimated, whether as glacier, iceberg, or pack ice, heaping\r\n shingle along coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our arrival, we found that a party of buxom, good-natured looking\r\ngirls who were tending yaks, were occupying the hut, which, however,\r\nthey cheerfully gave up to my people, spreading a black tent close by\r\nfor themselves; and next morning they set off with all their effects\r\npacked upon the yaks. The ground was marshy, and covered with cowslips,\r\n_Ranunculus,_ grasses and sedges, _Cyananthus,_ blue asters, gentians,\r\netc. The spot appearing highly favourable for observations, I\r\ndetermined to remain here during the equinoctial month, and put my\r\npeople on “two-thirds allowance,” _i.e.,_ four pounds of rice daily for\r\nthree men, allowing them to send down the valley to cater for what more\r\nthey could get. The Singtam Soubah was intensely disgusted with my\r\ndetermination: he accompanied me next day to the pass, and having\r\nexhausted his persuasions, threats, and warnings about snow, wind,\r\nrobbers, starvation, and Cheen sepoys, departed on the 12th for\r\nYeumtong, leaving me truly happy for the first time since quitting\r\nDorjiling. I had now a prospect of uninterruptedly following up my\r\npursuits at an elevation little below that of the summit of Mont Blanc,\r\nsurrounded by the loftiest mountains, and perhaps the vastest glaciers\r\non the globe; my instruments were in perfect order, and I saw around me\r\na curious and varied flora.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 9th of September promised fair, though billowy\r\nclouds were rapidly ascending the valley. To the eastward my attention\r\nwas directed to a double rainbow; the upper was an arch of the usual\r\nform, and the lower was the curved illuminated edge of a bank of\r\ncumulus, with the orange hues below. We took the path to the Donkia\r\npass, fording the river, and ascending in a north-east direction, along\r\nthe foot of stony hills that rise at a gradual slope of 12° to broad\r\nunsnowed ridges, 18,000 to 19,000 feet high. Shallow valleys,\r\nglacier-bound at their upper extremities, descend from the still\r\nloftier rearward mountains; and in these occur lakes. About five miles\r\nup, a broad opening on the west leads to Tomo Chamo, as the eastern\r\nsummit of Kinchinjhow is called.[237] Above this the valley expands\r\nvery much, and is stony and desert: stupendous mountains, upwards of\r\n21,000 feet high, rear themselves on all sides, and the desolation and\r\ngrandeur of the scene are unequalled in my experience. The path again\r\ncrosses the river (which is split into many channels), and proceeds\r\nnorthwards, over gravelly terraces and rocks with patches of Scotch\r\nalpine grasses (_Festuca ovina_ and _Poa laxa_), sedges, _Stipa,_\r\ndandelion, _Allardia,_ gentians, _Saussurea,_ and _Astragalus,_ varied\r\nwith hard hemispherical mounds of the alsineous plant mentioned at p.\r\n89.\r\n\r\n [237] On one occasion I ascended this valley, which is very broad,\r\n flat, and full of lakes at different elevations; one, at about 17,000\r\n feet elevation is three-quarters of a mile long, but not deep: no\r\n water-plants grew in it, but there were plenty of others round its\r\n margin. I collected, in the dry bed of a stream near it, a curious\r\n white substance like thick felt, formed of felspathic silt (no doubt\r\n the product of glacial streams) and the siliceous cells of infusoriæ.\r\n It much resembles the fossil or meteoric paper of Germany, which is\r\n also formed of the lowest tribes of fresh-water plants, though\r\n considered by Ehrenberg as of animal origin. A vein of granite in the\r\n bottom of the valley had completely altered the character of the\r\n gneiss, which contained veins of jasper and masses of amorphous\r\n garnet. Much olivine is found in the fissures of the gneiss: this\r\n feral is very rare in Sikkim, but I have also seen it in the fissures\r\n of the White gneissy granite of the surrounding heights.\r\n\r\n\r\nI passed several shallow lakes at 17,500 feet; their banks were green\r\nand marshy, and supported thirty or forty kinds of plants. At the head\r\nof the valley a steep rocky crest, 500 feet high, rises between two\r\nprecipitous snowy peaks, and a very fatiguing ascent (at this\r\nelevation) leads to the sharp rocky summit of the Donkia pass, 18,466\r\nfeet above the sea by barometer, and 17,866 by boiling-point. The view\r\non this occasion was obscured by clouds and fogs, except towards Tibet,\r\nin which direction it was magnificent; but as I afterwards twice\r\nascended this pass, and also crossed it, I shall here bring together\r\nall the particulars I noted.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan view, from its novelty, extent, and singularity, demands\r\nthe first notice: the Cholamoo lake lay 1500 feet below me, at the\r\nbottom of a rapid and rocky descent; it was a blue sheet of water,\r\nthree or four miles from north to south, and one and a half broad,\r\nhemmed in by rounded spurs from Kinchinjhow on one side, and from\r\nDonkia on the other: the Lachen flowed from its northern extremity, and\r\nturning westward, entered a broad barren valley, bounded on the north\r\nby red stony mountains, called Bhomtso, which I saw from Kongra Lama,\r\nand ascended with Dr. Campbell in the October following: though 18,000\r\nto 19,000 feet high, these mountains were wholly unsnowed. Beyond this\r\nrange lay the broad valley of the Arun, and in the extreme north-west\r\ndistance, to the north of Nepal, were some immense snowy mountains,\r\nreduced to mere specks on the horizon. The valley of the Arun was\r\nbounded on the north by very precipitous black rocky mountains,\r\nsprinkled with snow; beyond these again, from north to north-west,\r\nsnow-topped range rose over range in the clear purple distance. The\r\nnearer of these was the Kiang-lah, which forms the axis or water-shed\r\nof this meridian; its south drainage being to the Arun river, and its\r\nnorth to the Yaru-tsampu: it appeared forty to fifty miles off, and of\r\ngreat mean elevation (20,000 feet) the vast snowy mountains that rose\r\nbeyond it were, I was assured, beyond the Yaru, in the salt lake\r\ncountry.[238] A spur from Chomiomo cut off the view to the southward of\r\nnorth-west, and one from Donkia concealed all to the east of north.\r\n\r\n [238] This salt country was described to me as enormously lofty,\r\n perfectly sterile, and fourteen days’ march for loaded men and sheep\r\n from Jigatzi: there is no pasture for yaks, whose feet are cut by the\r\n rocks. The salt is dug (so they express it) from the margin of lakes;\r\n as is the carbonate of soda, “Pleu” of the Tibetans.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibet and Cholamoo Lake from the summit of the Donkia\r\nPass, looking north-west]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable features of this landscape were its enormous\r\nelevation, and its colours and contrast to the black, rugged, and snowy\r\nHimalaya of Sikkim. All the mountains between Donkia pass and the Arun\r\nwere comparatively gently sloped, and of a yellow red colour, rising\r\nand falling in long undulations like dunes, 2000 to 3000 feet above the\r\nmean level of the Arun valley, and perfectly bare of perpetual snow or\r\nglaciers. Rocks everywhere broke out on their flanks, and often along\r\ntheir tops, but the general contour of that immense area was very open\r\nand undulating, like the great ranges of Central Asia, described by MM.\r\nHuc and Gabet. Beyond this again, the mountains were rugged, often\r\nrising into peaks which, from the angles I took here, and subsequently\r\nat Bhomtso, cannot be below 24,000 feet, and are probably much higher.\r\nThe most lofty mountains were on the range north of Nepal, not less\r\nthan 120 miles distant, and which, though heavily snowed, were below\r\nthe horizon of Donkia pass.\r\n\r\nCholamoo lake lay in a broad, scantily grassed, sandy and stony valley;\r\nsnow-beds, rocks, and glaciers dipped abruptly towards its head, but on\r\nits west bank a lofty brick-red spur sloped upwards from it,\r\nconspicuously cut into terraces for several hundred feet above its\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nKambajong, the chief Tibetan village near this, after Phari and\r\nGiantchi, is situated on the Arun (called in Tibet “Chomachoo”), on the\r\nroad from Sikkim to Jigatzi[239] and Teshoo Loombo. I did not see it,\r\nbut a long, stony mountain range above the town is very conspicuous,\r\nits sides presenting an interrupted line of cliffs, resembling the\r\nport-holes of a ship: some fresh-fallen snow lay at the base, but none\r\nat the top, which was probably 18,500 feet high. The banks of the Arun\r\nare thence inhabited at intervals all the way to Tingré, where it\r\nenters Nepal.\r\n\r\n [239] I have adopted the simplest mode of spelling this name that I\r\n could find, and omitted the zong or jong, which means fort, and\r\n generally terminates it. I think it would not be difficult to\r\n enumerate fully a dozen ways of spelling the word, of which Shigatzi,\r\n Digarchi, and Djigatzi are the most common. The Tibetans tell me that\r\n they cross two passes after leaving Donkia, or Kongra Lama, en route\r\n for Jigatzi, on both of which they suffer from headaches and\r\n difficulty of breathing; one is over the Kambajong range; the other,\r\n much loftier, is over that of Kiang-lah: as they do not compliin of\r\n Bhomtso, which is also crossed, and is 18,500 feet, the others may be\r\n very lofty indeed. The distance from Donkia pass to Jigatzi is said to\r\n be ten days’ journey for loaded yaks. Now, according to Turner’s\r\n observations (evidently taken with great care) that capital is in\r\n latitude 29° 4′ 20″ north, or only seventy miles north of Donkia; and\r\n as the yak travels at the rate of sixteen miles a day, the country\r\n must be extraordinarily rugged, or the valleys tortuous. Turner took\r\n eight or nine days on his journey from Phari to Teshoo Loombo, a\r\n distance of only eighty miles; yet he is quoted as an authority for\r\n the fact of Tibet being a plain! he certainly crossed an undulating\r\n country, probably 16,000 to 17,000 feet high; a continuation eastwards\r\n of the Cholamoo features, and part of the same mountain range that\r\n connects Chumulari and Donkia: he had always lofty mountains in eight,\r\n and rugged ones on either side, after he had entered the Painomchoo\r\n valley. It is a remarkable and significant fact that Turner never\r\n appears to have seen Chumulari after having passed it, nor Donkia,\r\n Kinchinjhow, or Kinchinjunga at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDonkia rises to the eastward of the pass, but its top is not visible. I\r\nascended (over loose rocks) to between 19,000 and 20,000 feet, and\r\nreached vast masses of blue ribboned ice, capping the ridges, but\r\nobtained no further prospect. To the west, the beetling east summit of\r\nKinchinjhow rises at two miles distance, 3000 to 4000 feet above the\r\npass. A little south of it, and north of Chango Khang, the view extends\r\nthrough a gap in the Sebolah range, across the valley of the Lachen, to\r\nKinchinjunga, distant forty-two miles. The monarch of mountains looked\r\nquite small and low from this point, and it was difficult to believe it\r\nwas 10,000 feet more lofty than my position. I repeatedly looked from\r\nit to the high Tibetan mountains in the extreme north-west distance,\r\nand was more than ever struck with the apparently immense distance, and\r\nconsequent altitude of the latter: I put, however, no reliance on such\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\nTo the south the eye wandered down the valley of the Lachoong to the\r\nmountains of the Chola range, which appear so lofty from Dorjiling, but\r\nfrom here are sunk far below the horizon: on comparing these with the\r\nnorthern landscape, the wonderful difference between their respective\r\nsnow-levels, amounting to fully 5000 feet, was very apparent.\r\nSouth-east the stupendous snowy amphitheatre formed by the flank of\r\nDonkia was a magnificent spectacle.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful view forcibly impressed me with the fact, that all\r\neye-estimates in mountainous countries are utterly fallacious, if not\r\ncorrected by study and experience. I had been led to believe that from\r\nDonkia pass the whole country of Tibet sloped away in descending\r\nsteppes to the Tsampu, and was more or less of a plain; and could I\r\nhave trusted my eyes only, I should have confirmed this assertion so\r\nfar as the slope was concerned. When, however, the levelled theodolite\r\nwas directed to the distance, the reverse was found to be the case.\r\nUnsnowed and apparently low mountains touched the horizon line of the\r\ntelescope; which proves that, if only 37 miles off, they must, from the\r\ndip of the horizon, be at least 1000 feet higher than the observer’s\r\nposition. The same infallible guide cuts off mountain-tops and deeply\r\nsnowed ridges, which to the unaided eye appear far lower than the point\r\nfrom which they are viewed; but which, from the quantity of snow on\r\nthem, must be many thousand feet higher, and, from the angle they\r\nsubtend in the instrument, must be at an immense distance. The want of\r\nrefraction to lift the horizon, the astonishing precision of the\r\noutlines, and the brilliancy of the images of mountains reduced by\r\ndistance to mere specks, are all circumstances tending to depress them\r\nto appearance. The absence of trees, houses, and familiar objects to\r\nassist the eye in the appreciation of distance, throws back the whole\r\nlandscape; which, seen through the rarified atmosphere of 18,500 feet,\r\nlooks as if diminished by being surveyed through the wrong end of a\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nA few rude cairns were erected on the crest of the pass, covered with\r\nwands, red banners, and votive offerings of rags. I found a fine slab\r\nof slate, inscribed with the Tibetan characters, “Om Mani Padmi hom,”\r\nwhich Meepo allowed me to take away, as the reward of my exertions. The\r\nridge is wholly formed of angular blocks of white gneissy granite,\r\nsplit by frost.[240] There was no snow on the pass itself, but deep\r\ndrifts and glaciers descended in hollows on the north side, to 17,000\r\nfeet. The rounded northern red shoulder of Kinchinjhow by Cholamoo\r\nlake, apparently 19,000 feet high, was quite bare, and, as I have said,\r\nI ascended Donkia to upwards of 19,000 feet before I found the rocks\r\ncrusted with ice,[241] and the ground wholly frozen. I assume,\r\ntherefore, that 19,000 feet at this spot is not below the mean level at\r\nwhich all the snow melts that falls on a fair exposure to the south:\r\nthis probably coincides with a mean temperature of 20°. Forty miles\r\nfurther north (in Tibet) the same line is probably at 20,000 feet; for\r\nthere much less snow falls, and much more melts in proportion.[242]\r\nFrom the elevation of about 19,300 feet, which I attained on Donkia, I\r\nsaw a fine illustration of that atmospheric phenomenon called the\r\n“spectre of the Brocken,” my own shadow being projected on a mass of\r\nthin mist that rose above the tremendous precipices over which I hung.\r\nMy head was surrounded with a brilliant circular glory or rainbow.[243]\r\n\r\n [240] It was not a proper granite, but a highly metamorphic felspathic\r\n gneiss, with very little mica; being, I suspect, a gneiss which by\r\n metamorphic action was almost remolten into granite: the lamination\r\n was obscure, and marked by faint undulating lines of mica; it cleaves\r\n at all angles, but most generally along fissures with highly polished\r\n undulated black surfaces. The strike of the same rock near at hand was\r\n north-west, and dip north-east, at various angles.\r\n\r\n\r\n [241] Snow, transformed into ice throughout its whole mass: in short,\r\n glacial ice in all physical characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n [242] Two secondary considerations materially affecting the melting of\r\n snow, and hence exerting a material influence on the elevation of the\r\n snow-line, appear to me never to have been sufficiently dwelt upon.\r\n Both, however, bear directly upon the great elevation of the snow-line\r\n in Tibet. From the imperfect transmission of the heating rays of the\r\n sun through films of water, which transmit perfectly the luminous\r\n rays, it follows that the direct effects of the rays, in clear\r\n sunshine, are very different at equal elevations of the moist outer\r\n and dry inner Himalaya. Secondly, naked rock and soil absorb much more\r\n heat than surfaces covered with vegetation, and this heat again\r\n radiated is infinitely more rapidly absorbed by snow (or other white\r\n surfaces) than the direct heat of the sun’s rays is. Hence, at equal\r\n elevations the ground heats sooner, and the snow is more exposed to\r\n the heat thus radiated in arid Tibet, than in the wooded and grassed\r\n mountains of Sikkim.\r\n\r\n\r\n [243] Probably caused by spiculæ of ice floating in the atmosphere,\r\n the lateral surfaces of which would then have an uniform inclination\r\n of 60°: this, according to the observations of Mariotte, Venturi, and\r\n Fraunhœfer being the angle necessary for the formation of halos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the Donkia pass is much higher than might be\r\nanticipated from its great elevation, and from the fact of its being\r\nalways bitterly cold to the feelings. This is no doubt due to the\r\nwarmth of the ascending currents, and to the heat evolved during the\r\ncondensation of their vapours. I took the following observations:—\r\n\r\nTemp. D.P. Difference Tension Humidity Sept. 9\r\nSept. 27\r\nOct. 19 1.30–3.30 p.m.\r\n1.15–3.15 p.m.\r\n3.00–3.30 p.m. 41·8°\r\n49·2°\r\n40·1° 30·3°\r\n32·6°\r\n25·0° 11·5°\r\n16·6°\r\n15·1° 0·1876\r\n0·2037\r\n0·1551 0·665\r\n0·560\r\n0·585\r\n\r\nThe first and last of these temperatures were respectively 42·3° and\r\n46·4° lower than Calcutta, which, with the proper deduction for\r\nlatitude, allows 508 and 460 feet as equivalent to 1° Fahr. I left a\r\nminimum thermometer on the summit on the 9th of September, and removed\r\nit on the 27th, but it had been lifted and turned over by the action of\r\nthe frost and snow on the loose rocks amongst which I had placed it;\r\nthe latter appearing to have been completely shifted. Fortunately, the\r\ninstrument escaped unhurt, with the index at 28°.\r\n\r\nA violent southerly wind, with a scud of mist, and sometimes snow,\r\nalways blew over the pass: but we found shelter on the north face,\r\nwhere I twice kindled a fire, and boiled my thermometers.[244] On one\r\noccasion I felt the pulses of my party several times during two hours’\r\nrepose (without eating); the mean of eight persons was 105°, the\r\nextremes being 92° and 120°, and my own 108°.\r\n\r\n [244] On the 9th of September the boiling-point was 181·3°, and on the\r\n 27th, 181·2°. In both observations, I believe the kettle communicated\r\n a higher temperature to the thermometer than that of the water, for\r\n the elevations deduced are far too low.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne flowering plant ascends to the summit; the alsinaceous one\r\nmentioned at p. 89. The Fescue grass, a little fern (_Woodsia_), and a\r\n_Saussurea_[245] ascend very near the summit, and several lichens grow\r\non the top, as _Cladonia vermicularis,_ the yellow _Lecidea\r\ngeographica,_ and the orange _L. miniata_;[246] also some barren\r\nmosses. At 18,300 feet, I found on one stone only a fine Scotch lichen,\r\na species of _Gyrophora,_ the _“tripe de roche”_ of Arctic voyagers,\r\nand the food of the Canadian hunters; it is also abundant on the Scotch\r\nalps.\r\n\r\n [245] A pink-flowered woolly _Saussurea,_ and _Delphinium glaciale,_\r\n are two of the most lofty plants; both being commonly found from\r\n 17,500 to 18,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [246] This is one of the most Arctic, Antarctic, and universally\r\n diffused plants. The other lichens were _Lecidea atro-alba, oreina,\r\n elegans,_ and _chlorophana,_ all alpine European and Arctic species.\r\n At 17,000 feet occur _Lecanora ventosa, physodes, candelaria, sordida,\r\n atra,_ and the beautiful Swiss _L. chrysoleuca,_ also European\r\n species.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, I took one more long look at the boundless prospect;\r\nand, now that its important details were secured, I had leisure to\r\nreflect on the impression it produced. There is no loftier country on\r\nthe globe than that embraced by this view, and no more howling\r\nwilderness; well might the Singtam Soubah and every Tibetan describe it\r\nas the loftiest, coldest, windiest, and most barren country in the\r\nworld. Were it buried in everlasting snows, or burnt by a tropical sun,\r\nit might still be as utterly sterile; but with such sterility I had\r\nlong been familiar. Here the colourings are those of the fiery desert\r\nor volcanic island, while the climate is that of the poles. Never, in\r\nthe course of all my wanderings, had my eye rested on a scene so dreary\r\nand inhospitable. The “cities of the plain” lie sunk in no more\r\ndeath-like sea than Cholamoo lake, nor are the tombs of Petra hewn in\r\nmore desolate cliffs than those which flank the valley of the Tibetan\r\nArun.\r\n\r\nOn our return my pony strained his shoulder amongst the rocks; as a\r\nremedy, the Lachoong Phipun plunged a lancet into the muscle, and\r\ngiving me his own animal, rode mine down.[247] It drizzled and sleeted\r\nall the way, and was dark before we arrived at the tent.\r\n\r\n [247] These animals, called Tanghan, are wonderfully strong and\r\n enduring; they are never shod, and the hoof often cracks, and they\r\n become pigeon-toed: they are frequently blind of one eye, when they\r\n are called “zemik” (blind ones), but this is thought no great defect.\r\n They average 5 pounds to 10 pounds for a good animal in Tibet; and the\r\n best fetch 40 pounds to 50 pounds in the plains of India, where they\r\n become acclimated and thrive well. Giantchi (Jhansi-jeung of Turner)\r\n is the best mart for them in this part of Tibet, where some breeds\r\n fetch very high prices. The Tibetans give the foals of value messes of\r\n pig’s blood and raw liver, which they devour greedily, and it is said\r\n to strengthen them wonderfully; the custom is, I believe, general in\r\n central Asia. Humboldt (Pens. Nar. iv. p. 320) describes the horses of\r\n Caraccas as occasionally eating salt meat.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt night the Tibetan dogs are let loose, when they howl dismally: on\r\none occasion they robbed me of all my meat, a fine piece of yak’s\r\nflesh. The yaks are also troublesome, and bad sleepers; they used to\r\ntry to effect an entrance into my tent, pushing their muzzles under the\r\nflaps at the bottom, and awakening me with a snort and moist hot blast.\r\nBefore the second night I built a turf wall round the tent; and in\r\nfuture slept with a heavy tripod by my side, to poke at intruders.\r\n\r\nBirds flock to the grass about Momay; larks, finches, warblers,\r\nabundance of sparrows, feeding on the yak-droppings, and occasionally\r\nthe hoopoe; waders, cormorants, and wild ducks were sometimes seen in\r\nthe streams, but most of them were migrating south. The yaks are driven\r\nout to pasture at sunrise, and home at sunset, till the middle of the\r\nmonth, when they return to Yeumtong. All their droppings are removed\r\nfrom near the tents, and piled in heaps; as these animals, unlike their\r\nmasters, will not sleep amid such dirt. These heaps swarm with the\r\nmaggots of two large flies, a yellow and black, affording abundant food\r\nto red-legged crows, ravens, and swallows. Butterflies are rare; the\r\nfew are mostly _Colias, Hipparchia, Polyommatus,_ and _Melitæa_; these\r\nI have seen feeding at 17,000 feet; when found higher, they have\r\ngenerally been carried up by currents. Of beetles, an _Aphodeus,_ in\r\nyak-droppings, and an _Elaphrus,_ a predaceous genus inhabiting swamps,\r\nare almost the only ones I saw. The wild quadrupeds are huge sheep, in\r\nflocks of fifty, the _Ovis Ammon_ called “Gnow.” I never shot one, not\r\nhaving time to pursue them for they were very seldom seen, and always\r\nat great elevations. The larger marmot is common, and I found the horns\r\nof the “Tchiru” antelope. Neither the wild horse, fox, hare, nor\r\ntailless rat, cross the Donkia pass. White clover, shepherd’s purse,\r\ndock, plantain, and chickweed, are imported here by yaks; but the\r\ncommon _Prunella_ of Europe is wild, and so is a groundsel like\r\n_Senecio Jacobæa, Ranunculus, Sibbaldia,_ and 200 other plants. The\r\ngrasses are numerous; they belong chiefly to _Poa, Festuca, Stipa,_ and\r\nother European genera.\r\n\r\nI repeatedly attempted to ascend both Kinchinjhow and Donkia from\r\nMomay, and generally reached from 18,000 to 19,000 feet, but never much\r\nhigher.[248] The observations taken on these excursions are\r\nsufficiently illustrated by those of Donkia pass: they served chiefly\r\nto perfect my map, measure the surrounding peaks, and determine the\r\nelevation reached by plants; all of which were slow operations, the\r\nweather of this month being so bad that I rarely returned dry to my\r\ntent; fog and drizzle, if not sleet and snow, coming on during every\r\nday, without exception.\r\n\r\n [248] An elevation of 20,000 and perhaps 22,000 feet might, I should\r\n think, easily be attained by practice, in Tibet, north of Sikkim.\r\n\r\n\r\nI made frequent excursions to the great glacier of Kinchinjhow. Its\r\nvalley is about four miles long, broad and flat: Chango-khang[249]\r\nrears its blue and white cliffs 4,500 feet above its west flank, and\r\nthrows down avalanches of stones and snow into the valley. Hot\r\nsprings[250] burst from the ground near some granite rocks on its\r\nfloor, about 16,000 feet above the sea, and only a mile below the\r\nglacier, and the water collects in pools: its temperature is 110°, and\r\nin places 116°, or 4° hotter than that of the Yeumtong hot-springs,\r\nthough 4000 feet higher, and of precisely the same character. A\r\n_Barbarea_ and some other plants make the neighbourhood of the\r\nhot-springs a little oasis, and the large marmot is common, uttering\r\nits sharp, chirping squeak.\r\n\r\n [249] The elevation of this mountain is about 20,560 feet, by the mean\r\n of several observations taken from surrounding localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n [250] Supposing the mean temperature of the air at the elevation of\r\n the Momay springs to be 26° or 28°, which may be approximately\r\n assumed, and that, as some suppose, the heat of thermal springs is due\r\n to the internal temperature of the globe; then according to the law of\r\n increment of heat in descending (of 1° for fifty feet) we should find\r\n the temperature of 110° at a depth of 4,100 feet, or at 11,900 feet\r\n above the level of the sea. Direct experiment with internal heat has\r\n not, however, been carried beyond 2000 feet below the surface, and as\r\n the ratio of increment diminishes with the depth, that above assigned\r\n to the temperature of 110° is no doubt much too little. The Momay\r\n springs more probably owe their temperature to chemical decomposition\r\n of sulphurets of metals. I found pyrites in Tibet on the north flank\r\n of the mountain Kinchinjhow, in limestones associated with shales.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terminal moraine is about 500 feet high, quite barren, and thrown\r\nobliquely across the valley, from north-east to south-west, completely\r\nhiding the glacier. From its top successive smaller parallel ridges\r\n(indicating the periodic retirements of the glacier) lead down to the\r\nice, which must have sunk several hundred feet. This glacier descends\r\nfrom Kinchinjhow, the huge cliff of whose eastern extremity dips into\r\nit. The surface, less than half a mile wide, is exceedingly undulated,\r\nand covered with large pools of water, ninety feet deep, and beds of\r\nsnow, and is deeply corroded; gigantic blocks are perched on pinnacles\r\nof ice on its surface, and the gravel cones[251] are often twenty feet\r\nhigh. The crevassing so conspicuous on the Swiss glaciers is not so\r\nregular on this, and the surface appears more like a troubled ocean;\r\ndue, no doubt, to the copious rain and snow-falls throughout the\r\nsummer, and the corroding power of wet fogs. The substance of the ice\r\nis ribboned, dirt-bands are seen from above to form long loops on some\r\nparts, and the lateral moraines, like the terminal, are high above the\r\nsurface. These notes, made previous to reading Professor Forbes’s\r\ntravels in the Alps, sufficiently show that perpetual snow, whether as\r\nice or glacier, obeys the same laws in India as in Europe; and I have\r\nno remarks to offer on the structure of glaciers, that are not well\r\nillustrated and explained in the abovementioned admirable work.\r\n\r\n [251] For a description of this curious phenomenon, which has been\r\n illustrated by Agassiz, see “Forbes’s Alps,” p. 26 and 347.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts average slope for a mile above the terminal moraines was less than\r\n5°, and the height of its surface above the sea 16,500 feet by\r\nboiling-point; the thickness of its ice probably 400 feet. Between the\r\nmoraine and the west flank of the valley is a large lake, with terraced\r\nbanks, whose bottom (covered with fine felspathic silt) is several\r\nhundred feet above that of the valley; it is half a mile long, and a\r\nquarter broad, and fed partly by glaciers of the second order on\r\nChango-khang and Sebolah, and partly by filtration through the lateral\r\nmoraine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gneiss-block with granite bands, on the Kinchinjhow\r\nglacier]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII\r\n\r\nDonkia glaciers—Moraines—Dome of ice—Honey-combed surface—Rocks of\r\nDonkia—Metamorphic action of granite veins—Accident to\r\ninstruments—Sebolah pass—Bees, and May-flies—View—Temperature—Pulses of\r\nparty—Lamas and travellers at Momay—Weather and climate—Dr. Campbell\r\nleaves Dorjiling for Sikkim—Leave Momay—Yeumtong—Lachoong—Retardation\r\nof vegetation at low elevations—Choongtam—Landslips and debacle—Meet\r\nDr. Campbell—Motives for his journey—Second visit to Lachen\r\nvalley—Autumnal tints—Red currants—Lachen\r\nPhipun—Tungu—Scenery—Animals—Poisonous\r\nrhododendrons—Fire-wood—Palung—Elevations—Sitong—Kongra\r\nLama—Tibetans—Enter Tibet—Desolate\r\nscenery—Plants—Animals—Geology—Cholamoo lakes—Antelopes—Return to\r\nYeumtso—Dr. Campbell lost—Extreme cold—Headaches—Tibetan Dingpun and\r\nguard—Arms and accoutrements—Temperature of Yeumtso—Migratory\r\nbirds—Visit of Dingpun—Yeumtso lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of September I ascended to the great Donkia glaciers, east\r\nof Momay; the valley is much longer than that leading to the\r\nKinchinjhow glacier, and at 16,000 or 17,000 feet elevation, containing\r\nfour marshes or lakes, alternating with as many transverse moraines\r\nthat have dammed the river. These moraines seem in some cases to have\r\nbeen deposited where rocks in the bed of the valley obstructed the\r\ndownward progress of the ancient glacier; hence, when this latter\r\nfinally retired, it rested at these obstructions, and accumulated there\r\ngreat deposits, which do not cross the valley, but project from each\r\nside obliquely into it. The rocks _in situ_ on the floor of the valley\r\nare all _moutonnéed_ and polished on the top, sides, and face looking\r\nup the valley, but are rugged on that looking down it: gigantic blocks\r\nare poised on some. The lowest of the ancient moraines completely\r\ncrosses the river, which finds, its way between the boulders.\r\n\r\nUnder the red cliff of Forked Donkia the valley becomes very broad,\r\nbare, and gravelly, with a confusion of moraines, and turns more\r\nnorthwards. At the angle, the present terminal moraine rises like a\r\nmountain (I assumed it to be about 800 feet high),[252] and crosses the\r\nvalley from N.N.E. to S.S.W. From the summit, which rises above the\r\nlevel of the glacier, and from which I assume its present retirement, a\r\nmost striking scene opened. The ice filling an immense basin, several\r\nmiles broad and long, formed a low dome,[253] with Forked Donkia on the\r\nwest, and a serried range of rusty-red scarped mountains, 20,000 feet\r\nhigh on the north and east, separating large tributary glaciers. Other\r\nstill loftier tops of Donkia appeared behind these, upwards of 22,000\r\nfeet high, but I could not recognise the true summit (23,176 feet). The\r\nsurface was very rugged, and so deeply honey-combed that the foot often\r\nsank from six to eight inches in crisp wet ice. I proceeded a mile on\r\nit, with much more difficulty than on any Swiss glacier: this was owing\r\nto the elevation, and the corrosion of the surface into pits and pools\r\nof water; the crevasses being but few and distant. I saw no dirt-bands\r\non looking down upon it from a point I attained under the red cliff of\r\nForked Donkia, at an elevation of 18,307 feet by barometer, and 18,597\r\nby boiling-point. The weather was very cold, the thermometer fell from\r\n41° to 34°, and it snowed heavily after 3 p.m.\r\n\r\n [252] This is the largest and longest terminal moraine backed by an\r\n existing glacier that I examined with care: I doubt its being so high\r\n as the moraine of the Allalein glacier below the Mat-maark sea in the\r\n Sachs valley (Valais, Switzerland); but it is impossible to compare\r\n such objects from memory: the Donkia one was much the most uniform in\r\n height.\r\n\r\n\r\n [253] This convexity of the ice is particularly alluded to by Forbes\r\n (“Travels in the Alps,” p.386), as the “renflément” of Rendu and\r\n “surface bombee” of Agassiz, and is attributed to the effects of\r\n hydrostatic pressure tending to press the lower layers of ice upwards\r\n to the surface. My own impression at the time was, that the convexity\r\n of the surface of the Donkia glacier was due to a subjacent mountain\r\n spur running south from Donkia itself. I know, however, far too little\r\n of the topography of this glacier to advance such a conjecture with\r\n any confidence. In this case, as in all similar ones, broad expanses\r\n being covered to an enormous depth with ice, the surface of the latter\r\n must in some degree be modified by the ridges and valleys it conceals.\r\n The typical “surface bombee,” which is conspicuous in the Himalaya\r\n glaciers, I was wont (in my ignorance of the mechanical laws of\r\n glaciers) to attribute to the more rapid melting of the edges of the\r\n glacier by the radiated heat of its lateral moraines and of the flanks\r\n of the valley that it occupies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strike of all the rocks (gneiss with granite veins) seemed to be\r\nnorth-east, and dip north-west 30°. Such also were the strike and dip\r\non another spur from Donkia, north of this, which I ascended to 19,000\r\nfeet, on the 26th of September: it abutted on the scarped precipices,\r\n3000 feet high, of that mountain. I had been attracted to the spot by\r\nits bright orange-red colour, which I found to be caused by peroxide of\r\niron. The highly crystalline nature of the rocks, at these great\r\nelevations, is due to the action of veins of fine-grained granite,\r\nwhich sometimes alter the gneiss to such an extent that it appears as\r\nif fused into a fine granite, with distinct crystals of quartz and\r\nfelspar; the most quartzy layers are then roughly crystallized into\r\nprisms, or their particles are aggregated into spheres composed of\r\nconcentric layers of radiating crystals, as is often seen in agates.\r\nThe rearrangement of the mineral constituents by heat goes on here just\r\nas in trap, cavities filled with crystals being formed in rocks exposed\r\nto great heat and pressure. Where mica abounds, it becomes black and\r\nmetallic; and the aluminous matter is crystallised in the form of\r\ngarnets.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Summit of forked Donkia, and “Goa” antelopes]\r\n\r\nAt these great heights the weather was never fine for more than an hour\r\nat a time, and a driving sleet followed by thick snow drove me down on\r\nboth these occasions. Another time I ascended a third spur from this\r\ngreat mountain, and was overtaken by a heavy gale and thunderstorm, the\r\nlatter is a rare phenomenon: it blew down my tripod and instruments\r\nwhich I had thought securely Propped with stones, and the thermometers\r\nwere broken, but fortunately not the barometer. On picking up the\r\nlatter, which lay with its top down the hill, a large bubble of air\r\nappeared, which I passed up and down the tube, and then allowed to\r\nescape; when I heard a rattling of broken glass in the cistern. Having\r\nanother barometer[254] at my tent, I hastened to ascertain by\r\ncomparison whether the instrument which had travelled with me from\r\nEngland, and taken so many thousand observations, was seriously\r\ndamaged: to my delight an error of 0·020 was all I could detect at\r\nMomay and all other lower stations. On my return to Dorjiling in\r\nDecember, I took it to pieces, and found the lower part of the bulb of\r\nthe attached thermometer broken off, and floating on the mercury.\r\nHaving quite expected this, I always checked the observations of the\r\nattached thermometer by another, but—how, it is not easy to say—the\r\nbroken one invariably gave a correct temperature.\r\n\r\n [254] This barometer (one of Newman’s portable instruments) I have now\r\n at Kew: it was compared with the Royal Society’s standard before\r\n leaving England; and varied according to comparisons made with the\r\n Calcutta standard 0·.012 during its travels; on leaving Calcutta its\r\n error was 0; and on arriving in England, by the standard of the Royal\r\n Society, +·004. I have given in the Appendix some remarks on the use\r\n of these barometers, which (though they have obvious defects), are\r\n less liable to derangement, far more portable, and stand much heavier\r\n shocks than those of any other construction with which I am familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\nView from an elevation of 18,000 feet of the east top of Kinchinjhow,\r\nand of Tibet, over the ridge that connects it with Donkia. Wild sheep\r\n(Ovis Ammon) in the foreground\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kinchinjhow spurs are not accessible to so great an elevation as\r\nthose of Donkia, but they afford finer views over Tibet, across the\r\nridge connecting Kinchinjow with Donkia.\r\n\r\nBroad summits here, as on the opposite side of the valley, are quite\r\nbare of snow at 18,000 feet, though where they project as sloping\r\nhog-backed spurs from the parent mountain, the snows of the latter roll\r\ndown on them and form glacial caps, the reverse of glaciers in valleys,\r\nbut which overflow, as it were, on all sides of the slopes, and are\r\nribboned[255] and crevassed.\r\n\r\n [255] The convexity of the curves, however, seems to be upwards. Such\r\n reversed glaciers, ending abruptly on broad stony shoulders quite free\r\n of snow, should on no account be taken as indicating the lower limit\r\n of perpetual snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September I ascended the range which divides the Lachen\r\nfrom the Lachoong valley, to the Sebolah pass, a very sharp ridge of\r\ngneiss, striking north-west and dipping north-east, which runs south\r\nfrom Kinchinjhow to Chango-khang. A yak-track led across the\r\nKinchinjhow glacier, along the bank of the lake, and thence westward up\r\na very steep spur, on which was much glacial ice and snow, but few\r\nplants above 16,000 feet. At nearly 17,000 feet I passed two small\r\nlakes, on the banks of one of which I found bees, a May-fly\r\n(_Ephemera_) and gnat; the two latter bred on stones in the water,\r\nwhich (the day being fine) had a temperature of 53°, while that of the\r\nlarge lake at the glacier, 1000 feet lower, was only 39°.\r\n\r\nThe view from the summit commands the whole castellated front of\r\nKinchinjhow, the sweep of the Donkia cliffs to the east, Chango-khang’s\r\nblunt cone of ribbed snow[256] over head, while to the west, across the\r\ngrassy Palung dunes rise Chomiomo, the Thlonok mountains, and\r\nKinchinjunga in the distance.[257] The Palung plains, now yellow with\r\nwithered grass, were the most curious part of the view: hemmed in by\r\nthis range which rises 2000 feet above them, and by the Lachen hills on\r\nthe east, they appeared a dead level, from which Kinchinjhow reared its\r\nhead, like an island from the ocean.[258] The black tents of the\r\nTibetans were still there, but the flocks were gone. The broad\r\nfosse-like valley of the Chachoo was at my feet, with the river winding\r\nalong its bottom, and its flanks dotted with black juniper bushes.\r\n\r\n [256] This ridging or furrowing of steep snow-beds is explained at\r\n vol. i, p. 237\r\n\r\n\r\n [257] The latter bore 241° 30′; it was distant about thirty-four\r\n miles, and subtended an angle of 3° 2′ 30″. The rocks on its north\r\n flanks were all black, while those forming the upper 10,000 feet of\r\n the south face were white: hence, the top is probably granite,\r\n overlaid by the gneiss on the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n [258] It is impossible to contemplate the abrupt flanks of all these\r\n lofty mountains, without contrasting them with the sloping outlines\r\n that prevail in the southern parts of Sikkim. All such precipices are,\r\n I have no doubt, the results of sea action; and all posterior\r\n influence of sub-aerial action, aqueous or glacial, tends to wear\r\n these precipices into slopes, to fill up valleys and to level\r\n mountains. Of all such influences heavy rain-falls and a luxuriant\r\n vegetation are probably the most active; and these features are\r\n characteristic of the lower valleys of Sikkim, which are consequently\r\n exposed to very different conditions of wear and tear from those which\r\n prevail on these loftier rearward ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe temperature at this elevation, between 1 and 3 p.m., varied from\r\n38° to 59°; the mean being 46·5°, with the dew-point 34·6°. The height\r\nI made 17,585 feet by barometer, and 17,517 by boiling-point. I tried\r\nthe pulses of eight, persons after two hours’ rest; they varied from 80\r\nto 112, my own being 104. As usual at these heights, all the party were\r\nsuffering from giddiness and headaches.\r\n\r\nThroughout September various parties passed my tent at Momay, generally\r\nLamas or traders: the former, wrapped in blankets, wearing scarlet and\r\ngilt mitres, usually rode grunting yaks, which were sometimes led by a\r\nslave-boy or a mahogany-faced nun, with a broad yellow sheep-skin cap\r\nwith flaps over her ears, short petticoats, and striped boots. The\r\ndomestic utensils, pots, pans, and bamboos of butter, tea-churn,\r\nbellows, stools, books, and sacred implements, usually hung rattling on\r\nall sides of his holiness, and a sumpter yak carried the tents and mats\r\nfor sleeping. On several occasions large parties of traders, with\r\nthirty or forty yaks[259] laden with planks, passed, and occasionally a\r\nshepherd with Tibet sheep, goats, and ponies. I questioned many of\r\nthese travellers about the courses of the Tibetan rivers; they all\r\nagreed[260] in stating the Kambajong or Chomachoo liver, north of the\r\nLachen, to be the Arun of Nepal, and that it rose near the Ramchoo lake\r\n(of Turner’s route). The lake itself discharges either into the Arun,\r\nor into the Painomchoo (flowing to the Yaru); but this point I could\r\nnever satisfactorily ascertain. The weather at Momay, during September,\r\nwas generally bad after 11 a.m.: little snow or rain fell, but thin\r\nmists and drizzle prevailed; less than one inch and a half of rain was\r\ncollected, though upwards of eleven fell at Calcutta, and rather more\r\nat Dorjiling. The mornings were sometimes fine, cold, and sunny, with a\r\nnorth wind which had blown down the valley all night, and till 9 a.m.,\r\nwhen the south-east wind, with fog, came on. Throughout the day a north\r\ncurrent blew above the southern; and when the mist was thin; the air\r\nsparkled with spiculæ of snow, caused by the cold dry upper current\r\ncondensing the vapours of the lower. This southern current passes over\r\nthe tops of the loftiest mountains, ascending to 24,000 feet, and\r\ndischarging frequent showers in Tibet, as far north as Jigatzi, where,\r\nhowever, violent dry easterly gales are the most prevalent.\r\n\r\n [259] About 600 loaded yaks are said to cross the Donkia pass\r\n annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n [260] One lad only, declared that the Kambajong river flowed\r\n north-west to Dobtah and Sarrh, and thence turned north to the Yaru;\r\n but all Campbell’s itineraries, as well as mine, make the Dobtah lake\r\n drain into the Chomachoo, north of Wallanchoon; which latter river the\r\n Nepalese also affirm flows into Nepal, as the Arun. The Lachen and\r\n Lachoong Phipuns both insisted on this, naming to me the principal\r\n towns on the way south-west from Kambajong along the river to Tingri\r\n Maidan, _via_ Tashirukpa Chait, which is north of Wallanchoon pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equinoctial gales set in on the 21st, with a falling barometer, and\r\nsleet at night; on the 23rd and 24th it snowed heavily, and being\r\nunable to light a fire at the entrance of my tent, I spent two wretched\r\ndays, taking observations; on the 25th it cleared, and the snow soon\r\nmelted. Frosty nights succeeded, but the thermometer only fell to 31°\r\nonce during the month, and the maximum once rose to 62·5°. The mean\r\ntemperature from the 9th to the 30th September was 41·6°,[261] which\r\ncoincided with that of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.; the mean maximum, 52·2°,\r\nminimum, 34·7°, and consequent range, 17·5°.[262] On seven nights the\r\nradiating thermometer fell much below the temperature of the air, the\r\nmean being 10·5° and maximum 14·2°; and on seven mornings the sun\r\nheated the black-bulb thermometer considerably, on the mean to 62·6°\r\nabove the air; maximum 75·2°, and minimum, 43°. The greatest heat of\r\nthe day occurred at noon: the most rapid rise of temperature (5°)\r\nbetween 8 and 9 a.m., and the greatest fall (5·5°), between 3 and 4\r\np.m. A sunk thermometer fell from 52·5° to 51·5° between the 11th and\r\n14th, when I was obliged to remove the thermometer owing to the\r\naccident mentioned above. The mercury in the barometer rose and fell\r\ncontemporaneously with that at Calcutta and Dorjiling, but the amount\r\nof tide was considerably less, and, as is usual during the equinoctial\r\nmonth, on some days it scarcely moved, whilst on others it rose and\r\nfell rapidly. The tide amounted to 0·062 of an inch.\r\n\r\n [261] The result of fifty-six comparative observations between\r\n Calcutta and Momay, give 40·6° difference, which, after corrections,\r\n allows 1° Fahr. for every 438 feet of ascent.\r\n\r\n\r\n [262] At Dorjiling the September range is only 9·5°; and at Calcutta\r\n 10°.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of the month the Singtam Soubah came up from Yeumtong, to\r\nrequest leave to depart for his home, on account of his wife’s illness;\r\nand to inform me that Dr. Campbell had left Dorjiling, accompanied (in\r\ncompliance with the Rajah’s orders) by the Tchebu Lama. I therefore\r\nleft Momay on the 30th, to meet him at Choongtam, arriving at Yeumtong\r\nthe same night, amid heavy rain and sleet.\r\n\r\nAutumnal tints reigned at Yeumtong, and the flowers had disappeared\r\nfrom its heath-like flat; a small eatable cherry with a wrinkled stone\r\nwas ripe, and acceptable in a country so destitute of fruit.[263]\r\nThence I descended to Lachoong, on the 1st of October, again through\r\nheavy rain, the snow lying on the Tunkra mountain at 14,000 feet. The\r\nlarch was shedding its leaves, which turn red before they fall; but the\r\nannual vegetation was much behind that at 14,000 feet, and so many late\r\nflowerers, such as _Umbelliferæ_ and _Compositæ,_ had come into\r\nblossom, that the place still looked gay and green: the blue climbing\r\ngentian (_Crawfurdia_) now adorned the bushes; this plant would be a\r\ngreat acquisition in English gardens. A _Polygonum_ still in flower\r\nhere, was in ripe fruit near Momay, 6000 feet higher up the valley.\r\n\r\n [263] The absence of _Vaccinia_ (whortleberries and cranberries) and\r\n eatable _Rubi_ (brambles) in the alpine regions of the Himalaya is\r\n very remarkable, and they are not replaced by any substitute. With\r\n regard to Vaccinium, this is the more anomalous, as several species\r\n grow in the temperate regions of Sikkim.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day I made a long and very fatiguing march to\r\nChoongtam, but the coolies were not all able to accomplish it. The\r\nbackwardness of the flora in descending was even more conspicuous than\r\non the previous day: the jungles, at 7000 feet, being gay with a\r\nhandsome Cucurbitaceous plant. Crossing the Lachoong cane-bridge, I\r\npaid the tribute of a sigh to the memory of my poor dog, and reached my\r\nold camping-ground at Choongtam by 10 p.m., having been marching\r\nrapidly for twelve hours. My bed and tent came up two hours later, and\r\nnot before the leeches and mosquitos had taxed me severely. On the 4th\r\nof October I heard the nightingale for the first time this season.\r\n\r\nExpecting Dr. Campbell on the following morning, I proceeded down the\r\nriver to meet him: the whole valley was buried under a torrent or\r\ndébacle of mud, shingle, and boulders, and for half a mile the stream\r\nwas dammed up into a deep lake. Amongst the gneiss and granite boulders\r\nbrought down by this débacle, I collected some actinolites; but all\r\nminerals are extremely rare in Sikkim and I never heard of a gem or\r\ncrystal of any size or beauty, or of an ore of any consequence, being\r\nfound in this country.\r\n\r\nI met my friend on the other side of the mud torrent, and I was truly\r\nrejoiced to see him, though he was looking much the worse for his\r\ntrying journey through the hot valleys at this season; in fact, I know\r\nno greater trial of the constitution than the exposure and hard\r\nexercise that is necessary in traversing these valleys, below 5000\r\nfeet, in the rainy season: delay is dangerous, and the heat, anxiety,\r\nand bodily suffering from fatigue, insects, and bruises, banish sleep,\r\nand urge the restless traveller onward to higher and more healthy\r\nregions. Dr. Campbell had, I found, in addition to the ordinary dangers\r\nof such a journey, met with an accident which might have proved\r\nserious; his pony having been dashed to pieces by falling over a\r\nprecipice, a fate he barely escaped himself, by adroitly slipping from\r\nthe saddle when he felt the animal’s foot giving way.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to Choongtam, he detailed to me the motives that had\r\nled to his obtaining the authority of the Deputy-Governor of Bengal\r\n(Lord Dalhousie being absent) for his visiting Sikkim. Foremost, was\r\nhis earnest desire to cultivate a better understanding with the Rajah\r\nand his officers. He had always taken the Rajah’s part, from a\r\nconviction that he was not to blame for the misunderstandings which the\r\nSikkim officers pretended to exist between their country and Dorjiling;\r\nhe had, whilst urgently remonstrating with the Rajah, insisted on\r\nforbearance on my part, and had long exercised it himself. In detailing\r\nthe treatment to which I was subjected, I had not hesitated to express\r\nmy opinion that the Rajah was more compromised by it than his Dewan:\r\nDr. Campbell, on the contrary, knew that the Dewan was the head and\r\nfront of the whole system of annoyance. In one point of view it\r\nmattered little who was in the right; but the transaction was a\r\nviolation of good faith on the part of the Sikkim government towards\r\nthe British, for which the Rajah, however helpless, was yet\r\nresponsible. To act upon my representations alone would have been\r\nunjust, and no course remained but for Dr. Campbell to inquire\r\npersonally into the matter. The authority to do this gave him also the\r\nopportunity of becoming acquainted with the country which we were bound\r\nto protect, as well by our interest as by treaty, but from which we\r\nwere so jealously excluded, that should any contingency occur, we were\r\nignorant of what steps to take for defence, and, indeed, of what we\r\nshould have to defend.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of October we left Choongtam for my second visit to the\r\nKongra Lama pass, hoping to get round by the Cholamoo lakes and the\r\nDonkia pass. As the country beyond the frontier was uninhabited, the\r\nTchebu Lama saw no difficulty in this, provided the Lachen Phipun and\r\nthe Tibetans did not object. Our great obstacle was the Singtam Soubah,\r\nwho (by the Rajah’s order) accompanied us to clear the road, and give\r\nus every facility, but who was very sulky, and undisguisedly rude to\r\nCampbell; he was in fact extremely jealous of the Lama, who held higher\r\nauthority than he did, and who alone had the Rajah’s confidence.\r\n\r\nOur first day’s march was of about ten miles to one of the river-flats,\r\nwhich was covered with wild apple-trees, whose fruit, when stewed with\r\nsugar, we found palatable. The Lachen river, though still swollen, was\r\ncomparatively clear; the rains usually ceasing, or at least moderating,\r\nin October: its water was about 5° colder than in the beginning of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nDuring the second day’s march we were stopped at the Taktoong river by\r\nthe want of a bridge, which the Singtam Soubah refused to exert himself\r\nto have repaired; its waters were, however, so fallen, that our now\r\nlarge party soon bridged it with admirable skill. We encamped the\r\nsecond night on Chateng, and the following day made a long march,\r\ncrossing the Zemu, and ascending half-way to Tallum Samdong. The alpine\r\nfoliage was rapidly changing colour; and that of the berberry turning\r\nscarlet, gave a warm glow to the mountain above the forest. Lamteng\r\nvillage was deserted: turnips were maturing near the houses, and\r\nbuckwheat on the slope behind; the latter is a winter-crop at lower\r\nelevations, and harvested in April. At Zemu Samdong the willow-leaves\r\nwere becoming sear and yellow, and the rose-bushes bore enormous\r\nscarlet hips, two inches long, and covered with bristles; they were\r\nsweet, and rather good eating. Near Tungu (where we arrived on the 9th)\r\nthe great Sikkim currant was in fruit; its berries are much larger than\r\nthe English, and of the same beautiful red colour, but bitter and very\r\nacid; they are, however, eaten by the Tibetans, who call them\r\n“Kewdemah.”\r\n\r\nNear the village I found Dr. Campbell remonstrating with the Lachen\r\nPhipun on the delays and rude treatment I had received in June and\r\nJuly: the man, of course, answered every question with falsehoods,\r\nwhich is the custom of these people, and produced the Rajah’s orders\r\nfor my being treated with every civility, as a proof that he must have\r\nbehaved as he ought! The Singtam Soubah, as was natural, hung back, for\r\nit was owing to him alone that the orders had been contravened, and the\r\nPhipun appealed to the bystanders for the truth of this.\r\n\r\nThe Phipun (accompanied by his Larpun or subordinate officer) had\r\nprepared for us a sumptuous refreshment of tea soup, which was brewing\r\nby the road, and in which all animosities were soon washed away. We\r\ntook up our abode at Tungu in a wooden but under the great rock, where\r\nwe were detained for several days by bad weather. I was assured that\r\nduring all August and September the weather had been uniformly gloomy,\r\nas at Momay, though little rain had fallen.\r\n\r\nWe had much difficulty in purchasing a sufficient number of\r\nblankets[264] for our people, and in arranging for our journey, to\r\nwhich the Lachen Phipun was favourable, promising us ponies for the\r\nexpedition. The vegetation around was wholly changed since my July\r\nvisit: the rhododendron scrub was verdigris-green from the young leaves\r\nwhich burst in autumn, and expose at the end of each branchlet a\r\nflower-bud covered with resinous scales, which are thrown off in the\r\nfollowing spring. The jungle was spotted yellow with the withered\r\nbirch, maple and mountain-ash, and scarlet with berberry bushes; while\r\nabove, the pastures were yellow-brown with the dead grass, and streaked\r\nwith snow.\r\n\r\n [264] These were made of goat’s wool, teazed into a satiny surface by\r\n little teazle-like brushes of bamboo.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst other luxuries, we procured the flesh of yak calves, which is\r\nexcellent veal: we always returned the foot for the mother to lick\r\nwhile being milked, without which she yields nothing. The yak goes nine\r\nmonths with calf, and drops one every two years, bearing altogetber ten\r\nor twelve: the common Sikkim cow of lower elevations, at Dorjiling\r\ninvariably goes from nine and a half to ten months, and calves\r\nannually: ponies go eleven months, and foal nearly every year. In Tibet\r\nthe sheep are annually sheared; the ewes drop their young in spring and\r\nautumn, but the lambs born at the latter period often die of cold and\r\nstarvation, and double lambing is unknown; whereas, in the plains of\r\nBengal (where, however, sheep cannot be said to thrive without pulse\r\nfodder) twins are constantly born. At Dorjiling the sheep drop a lamb\r\nonce in the season. The Tibetan mutton we generally found dry and\r\nstringy.\r\n\r\nIn these regions many of my goats and kids had died foaming at the\r\nmouth and grinding their teeth; and I here discovered the cause to\r\narise from their eating the leaves of _Rhododendron cinnabarinum_[265]\r\n(“Kema Kechoong,” Lepcha: Kema signifying Rhododendron): this species\r\nalone is said to be poisonous; and when used as fuel, it causes the\r\nface to swell and the eyes to inflame; of which I observed several\r\ninstances. As the subject of fire-wood is of every-day interest to the\r\ntraveller in these regions, I may here mention that the rhododendron\r\nwoods afford poor fires; juniper burns the brightest, and with least\r\nsmoke. _Abies Webbiana,_ though emitting much smoke, gives a cheerful\r\nfire, far superior to larch,[266] spruce, or _Abies Brunoniana._ At\r\nDorjiling, oak is the common fuel; alder is also good. Chestnut is\r\ninvariably used for blacksmith’s charcoal. Magnolia has a disagreeable\r\nodour, and laurel burns very badly.\r\n\r\n [265] The poisonous honey produced by other species is alluded to at\r\n vol. i., p. 201. An _Andromeda_ and a _Gualtheria,_ I have been\r\n assured are equally deleterious.\r\n\r\n\r\n [266] The larch of northern Asia (_Larix Europœa_) is said to produce\r\n a pungent smoke, which I never observed to be the case with the Sikkim\r\n species.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of phosphorescence is most conspicuous on stacks of\r\nfire-wood. At Dorjiling, during the damp, warm, summer months (May to\r\nOctober), at elevations of 5000 to 8000 feet, it may be witnessed every\r\nnight by penetrating a few yards into the forest—at least it was so in\r\n1848 and 1849; and during my stay there billets of decayed wood were\r\nrepeatedly sent to me by residents, with inquiries as to the cause of\r\ntheir luminosity. It is no exaggeration to say that one does not need\r\nto move from the fireside to see this phenomenon, for if there is a\r\npartially decayed log amongst the fire-wood, it is almost sure to glow\r\nwith a pale phosphoric light. A stack of fire-wood, collected near my\r\nhost’s (Mr. Hodgson) cottage, presented a beautiful spectacle for two\r\nmonths (in July and August), and on passing it at night, I had to quiet\r\nmy pony, who was always alarmed by it. The phenomenon invariably\r\naccompanies decay, and is common on oak, laurel (_Tetranthera_), birch,\r\nand probably other timbers; it equally appears on cut wood and on\r\nstumps, but is most frequent on branches lying close to the ground in\r\nthe wet forests. I have reason to believe that it spreads with great\r\nrapidity from old surfaces to freshly cut ones. That it is a vital\r\nphenomenon, and due to the mycelium of a fungus, I do not in the least\r\ndoubt, for I have observed it occasionally circumscribed by those black\r\nlines which are often seen to bound mycelia on dead wood, and to\r\nprecede a more rapid decay. I have often tried, but always in vain, to\r\ncoax these mycelia into developing some fungus, by placing them in damp\r\nrooms, etc. When camping in the mountains, I frequently caused the\r\nnatives to bring phosphorescent wood into my tent, for the pleasure of\r\nwatching its soft undulating light, which appears to pale and glow with\r\nevery motion of the atmosphere; but except in this difference of\r\nintensity, it presents no change in appearance night after night.\r\nAlcohol, heat, and dryness soon dissipate it; electricity I never\r\ntried. It has no odour, and my dog, who had a fine sense of smell, paid\r\nno heed when it was laid under his nose.[267]\r\n\r\n [267] As far as my observations go, this phenomenon of light is\r\n confined to the lower orders of vegetable life, to the fungi alone,\r\n and is not dependent on irritability. I have never seen luminous\r\n flowers or roots, nor do I know of any authenticated instance of such,\r\n which may not be explained by the presence of mycelium or of animal\r\n life. In the animal kingdom, luminosity is confined, I believe, to the\r\n Invertebrata, and is especially common amongst the Radiata and\r\n Mollusca; it is also frequent in the Entromostracous Crustacea, and in\r\n various genera of most orders of insects. In all these, even in the\r\n Sertulariæ, I have invariably observed the light to be increased by\r\n irritation, in which respect the luminosity of animal life differs\r\n from that of vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather continuing bad, and snow falling, the country people began\r\nto leave for their winter-quarters at Lamteng. In the evenings we\r\nenjoyed the company of the Phipun and Tchebu Lama, who relished a cup\r\nof sugarless tea more than any other refreshment we could offer. From\r\nthem we collected much Tibetan information:—the former was an\r\ninveterate smoker, using a pale, mild tobacco, mixed largely with\r\nleaves of the small wild Tibetan Rhubarb, called “Chula.” Snuff is\r\nlittle used, and is principally procured from the plains of India.\r\n\r\nWe visited Palung twice, chiefly in hopes that Dr. Campbell might see\r\nthe magnificent prospect of Kinchinjhow from its plains: the first time\r\nwe gained little beyond a ducking, but on the second (October the 15th)\r\nthe view was superb; and I likewise caught a glimpse of Kinchinjunga\r\nfrom the neighbouring heights, bearing south 60° west and distant forty\r\nmiles. I also measured barometrically the elevation at the great chait\r\non the plains, and found it 15,620 feet, and by carefully boiled\r\nthermometers, 15,283, on the 13th October, and 15,566 on the 15th: the\r\ndifference being due to the higher temperature on the latter day, and\r\nto a rise of 0·3° on both boiling-point thermometers above what the\r\nsame instruments stood at on the 13th. The elevation of Tungu from the\r\nOctober barometrical observations was only seven feet higher than that\r\ngiven by those of July; the respective heights being 12,766 feet in\r\nJuly, and 12,773 in October.[268] The mean temperature had fallen from\r\n50° in July to 41°, and that of the sunk thermometer from 57° to 51·4°.\r\nThe mean range in July was 23·3°, and in October 13·8°; the weather\r\nduring the latter period being, however, uniformly cold and misty, this\r\nwas much below the mean monthly range, which probably exceeds 30°. Much\r\nmore rain fell in October at Tungu than at Dorjiling, which is the\r\nopposite to what occurs during the rainy season.\r\n\r\n [268] The elevation of Tungu by boiling-point was 12,650 feet by a set\r\n of July observations, 12,818 by a set taken on the 11th of October,\r\n and 12,544 by a set on the 14th of October: the discrepancies were\r\n partly due to the temperature corrections, but mainly to the readings\r\n of the thermometers, which were—\r\n\r\nJuly 28, sunset\r\nOct. 11, noon\r\nOct. 14, sunset 189·5\r\n189·5\r\n190·1 air 47·3°\r\nair 37·6°\r\nair 45·3° elev. 12,650\r\nelev. 12,818\r\nelev. 12,544\r\n\r\n_October 15th._ Having sent the coolies forward, with instructions to\r\nhalt and camp on this side of the Kongra Lama pass, we followed them,\r\ntaking the route by Palung, and thence over the hills to the Lachen, to\r\nthe east of which we descended, and further up its valley joined the\r\nadvanced party in a rocky glen, called Sitong, an advantageous camping\r\nground, from being sheltered by rocks which ward off the keen blasts:\r\nits elevation is 15,370 feet above the sea, and the magnificent west\r\ncliff of Kinchinjhow towers over it not a mile distant, bearing due\r\neast, and subtending an angle of 24·3°. The afternoon was misty, but at\r\n7 p.m. the south-east wind fell, and was immediately succeeded by the\r\nbiting north return current, which dispelled the fog: hoar-frost\r\nsparkled on the ground, and the moon shone full on the snowy head of\r\nKinchinjhow, over which the milky-way and the broad flashing orbs of\r\nthe stars formed a jewelled diadem. The night was very windy and cold,\r\nthough the thermometer fell no lower than 22°, that placed in a\r\npolished parabolic reflector to 20°, and another laid on herbage to\r\n17·5°.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th we were up early. I felt very anxious about the prospect of\r\nour getting round by Donkia pass and Cholamoo, which would enable me to\r\ncomplete the few remaining miles of my long survey of the Teesta river,\r\nand which promised immense results in the views I should obtain of the\r\ncountry, and of the geology and botany of these lofty snowless regions.\r\nCampbell, though extremely solicitous to obtain permission from the\r\nTibetan guard, (who were waiting for us on the frontier), was\r\nnevertheless bound by his own official position to yield at once to\r\ntheir wishes, should they refuse us a passage.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose on our camp at 7.30 a.m., when the north wind fell; and\r\nwithin an hour afterwards the temperature had risen to 45°. Having had\r\nour sticks[269] warmed and handed to us, we started on ponies,\r\naccompanied by the Lama only, to hold a parley with the Tibetans;\r\nordering the rest of the party to follow at their leisure. We had not\r\nproceeded far when we were joined by two Tibetan Sepoys, who, on our\r\nreaching the pass, bellowed lustily for their companions; when Campbell\r\nand the Lama drew up at the chait of Kongra Lama, and announced his\r\nwish to confer with their commandant.\r\n\r\n [269] It was an invariable custom of our Lepcba and Tibetan\r\n attendants, to warm the handles of our sticks in cold weather, before\r\n starting on our daily marches. This is one of many little instances I\r\n could adduce, of their thoughtfulness and attention to the smallest\r\n comforts of the stranger and wanderer in their lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy anxiety was now wound up to a pitch; I saw men with matchlocks\r\nemerging from amongst the rocks under Chomiomo, and despairing of\r\npermission being obtained, I goaded my pony with heels and stick, and\r\ndashed on up the Lachen valley, resolved to make the best of a splendid\r\nday, and not turn back till I had followed the river to the Cholamoo\r\nlakes: The Sepoys followed me a few paces, but running being difficult\r\nat 16,000 feet, they soon gave up the chase.\r\n\r\nA few miles ride in a north-east direction over an open, undulating\r\ncountry, brought me to the Lachen, flowing westwards in a broad, open,\r\nstony valley, bounded by Kinchinjhow on the south, (its face being as\r\nprecipitous as that on the opposite side), and on the north by the\r\nPeukathlo, a low range of rocky, sloping mountains, of which the\r\nsummits were 18,000 to 19,000 feet above the sea. Enormous erratic\r\nblocks of gneiss strewed the ground, which was sandy or gravelly, and\r\ncut into terraces along the shallow, winding river, the green and\r\nsparkling waters of which rippled over pebbles, or expanded into\r\nlagoons. The already scanty vegetation diminished rapidly: it consisted\r\nchiefly of scattered bushes of a dwarf scrubby honeysuckle and tufts of\r\nnettle, both so brittle as to be trodden into powder, and the short\r\nleafless twiggy _Ephedra,_ a few inches higher. The most alpine\r\nrhododendron (_R. nivale_) spread its small rigid branches close to the\r\nground; the hemispherical _Arenaria,_ another type of sterility, rose\r\nhere and there, and tufts of _Myosotis, Artemisia, Astragali,_ and\r\n_Adrosace,_ formed flat cushions level with the soil. Grass was very\r\nscarce, but a running wiry sedge (_Carex Moorcroftii_) bound the sand,\r\nlike the _Carex arenaria_ of our English coasts.\r\n\r\nA more dismally barren country cannot well be conceived, nor one more\r\nstrongly contrasting with the pastures of Palung at an equal elevation.\r\nThe long lofty wall of Kinchinjhow and Donkia presents an effectual\r\nbarrier to the transmission of moisture to the head of the Lachen\r\nvalley, which therefore becomes a type of such elevations in Tibet. As\r\nI proceeded, the ground became still more sandy, chirping under the\r\npony’s feet; and where harder, it was burrowed by innumerable marmots,\r\nfoxes, and the “Goomchen,” or tail-less rat (_Lagomys badius_),\r\nsounding hollow to the tread, and at last becoming so dangerous that I\r\nwas obliged to dismount and walk.\r\n\r\nThe geological features changed as rapidly as those of the climate and\r\nvegetation, for the strike of the rocks being north-west, and the dip\r\nnorth-east, I was rising over the strata that overlie the gneiss. The\r\nupper part of Kinchinjhow is composed of bold ice-capped cliffs of\r\ngneiss; but the long spurs that stretch northwards from it are of\r\nquartz, conglomerates, slates, and earthy red clays, forming the\r\nrounded terraced hills I had seen from Donkia pass. Between these spurs\r\nwere narrow valleys, at whose mouths stupendous blocks of gneiss rest\r\non rocks of a much later geological formation.\r\n\r\nOpposite the most prominent of these spurs the river (16,800 feet above\r\nthe sea) runs west, forming marshes, which were full of _Zannichellia\r\npalustris_ and _Ranunculus aquatilis,_ both English and Siberian\r\nplants: the waters contained many shells, of a species of\r\n_Lymnæa_;[270] and the soil near the edge, which was covered with tufts\r\nof short grass, was whitened with effloresced carbonate of soda. Here\r\nwere some square stone enclosures two feet high, used as pens, and for\r\npitching tents in; within them I gathered some unripe barley.\r\n\r\n [270] This is the most alpine living shell in the world; my specimens\r\n being from nearly 17,000 feet elevation; it is the _Lymnæa Hookeri,_\r\n Reeve (“Proceedings of the Zoological Society,” No. 204).\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond this I recognised a hill of which I had taken bearings from\r\nDonkia pass, and a few miles further, on rounding a great spur of\r\nKinchinjunga, I arrived in sight of Cholamoo lakes, with the Donkia\r\nmountain rearing its stupendous precipices of rock and ice on the east.\r\nMy pony was knocked up, and I felt very giddy from the exertion and\r\nelevation; I had broken his bridle, and so led him on by my plaid for\r\nthe last few miles to the banks of the lake; and there, with the\r\npleasant sound of the waters rippling at my feet, I yielded for a few\r\nmoments to those emotions of gratified ambition which, being unalloyed\r\nby selfish considerations for the future; become springs of happiness\r\nduring the remainder of one’s life.\r\n\r\nThe landscape about Cholamoo lakes was simple in its elements, stern\r\nand solemn; and though my solitary situation rendered it doubly\r\nimpressive to me, I doubt whether the world contains any scene with\r\nmore sublime associations than this calm sheet of water, 17,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, with the shadows of mountains 22,000 to 24,000 feet\r\nhigh, sleeping on its bosom.\r\n\r\nThere was much short grass about the lake, on which large antelopes,\r\n“Chiru” (_Antilope Hodgsoni_),[271] and deer, “Goa” (_Procapra\r\npicticaudata,_ Hodgson), were feeding. There were also many\r\nslate-coloured hales with white rumps (_Lepus oiostolus_), with marmots\r\nand tail-less rats. The abundance of animal life was wonderful,\r\ncompared with the want of it on the south side of Donkia pass, not five\r\nmiles distant in a straight line! it is partly due to the profusion of\r\ncarbonate of soda, of which all ruminants are fond, and partly to the\r\ndryness of the climate, which is favourable to all burrowing\r\nquadrupeds. A flock of common English teal were swimming in the lake,\r\nthe temperature of which was 55°.\r\n\r\n [271] I found the horns of this animal on the south side of the Donkia\r\n pass, but I never saw a live one except in Tibet. The _Procapra_ is\r\n described by Mr. Hodgson, “Bengal As. Soc. Jour., 1846, p. 388,” and\r\n is introduced into the cut at p. 139.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antelope’s head]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figures of the heads of the Chiru (_Antilope\r\nHodgsoni_), were sketched by Lieut. Maxwell (of the Bengal Artillery),\r\nfrom a pair brought to Dorjiling; it is the so-called unicorn of Tibet,\r\nand of MM. HuC and Gabet’s narrative,—a name which the profile no doubt\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had come about fifteen miles from the pass, and arrived at 1 p.m.,\r\nremaining half an hour. I could not form an idea as to whether Campbell\r\nhad followed or not, and began to speculate on the probability of\r\npassing the night in the open air, by the warm side of my steed. Though\r\nthe sun shone brightly, the wind was bitterly cold, and I arrived at\r\nthe stone dykes of Yeumtso at 3 p.m., quite exhausted with fatigue and\r\nheadache. I there found, to my great relief, the Tchebu Lama and Lachen\r\nPhipun: they were in some alarm at my absence, for they thought I was\r\nnot aware of the extreme severity of the temperature on the north side\r\nof the snows, or of the risk of losing my way; they told me that after\r\na long discourse with the Dingpun (or commander) of the Tibetan Sepoys,\r\nthe latter had allowed all the party to pass; that the Sepoys had\r\nbrought on the coolies, who were close behind, but that they themselves\r\nhad seen nothing of Campbell; of whom the Lama then went in search.\r\n\r\nThe sun set behind Chomiomo at 5 p.m., and the wind at once dropped, so\r\nlocal are these violent atmospheric currents, which are caused by the\r\nheating of the upper extremities of these lofty valleys, and consequent\r\nrarefaction of the air. Intense terrestrial radiation immediately\r\nfollows the withdrawal of the sun’s rays, and the temperature sinks\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nSoon after sunset the Lama returned, bringing Campbell; who, having\r\nmistaken some glacier-fed lakes at the back of Kinchinjhow for those of\r\nCholamoo, was looking for me. He too had speculated on having to pass\r\nthe night under a rock, with one plaid for himself and servant; in\r\nwhich case I am sure they would both have been frozen to death, having\r\nno pony to lie down beside. He told me that after I had quitted Kongra\r\nLama, leaving him with the Tchebu Lama and Phipun, the Dingpun and\r\ntwenty men came up, and very civilly but formally forbade their\r\ncrossing the frontier; but that upon explaining his motives, and\r\nrepresenting that it would save him ten days’ journey, the Dingpun had\r\nrelented, and promised to conduct the whole party to the Donkia pass.\r\n\r\nWe pitched our little tent in the corner of the cattle-pen, and our\r\ncoolies soon afterwards came up; mine were in capital health, though\r\nsuffering from headaches, but Campbell’s were in a distressing state of\r\nillness and fatigue, with swollen faces and rapid pulses, and some were\r\ninsensible from symptoms like pressure on the brain;[272] these were\r\nchiefly Ghorkas (Nepalese). The Tibetan Dingpun and his guard arrived\r\nlast of all, he was a droll little object, short, fat, deeply marked\r\nwith small-pox, swarthy, and greasy; he was robed in a green woollen\r\nmantle, and was perched on the back of a yak, which also carried his\r\nbedding, and cooking utensils, the latter rattling about its flanks,\r\nhorns, neck, and every point of support: two other yaks bore the tents\r\nof the party. His followers were tall savage looking fellows, with\r\nbroad swarthy faces, and their hair in short pig-tails. They wore the\r\nlong-sleeved cloak, short trousers, and boots, all of thick woollen,\r\nand felt caps on their heads. Each was armed with a long matchlock\r\nslung over his back, with a moveable rest having two prongs like a\r\nfork, and a hinge, so as to fold up along the barrel, when the prongs\r\nproject behind the shoulders like antelope horns, giving the uncouth\r\nwarrior a droll appearance. A dozen cartridges, each in an iron case,\r\nwere slung round the waist, and they also wore the long knife, flint,\r\nsteel, and iron tobacco-pipe, pouch, and purse, suspended to a leathern\r\ngirdle.\r\n\r\n [272] I have never experienced bleeding at the nose, ears, lips or\r\n eyelids, either in my person or that of my companions, on these\r\n occasions; nor did I ever meet with a recent traveller who has. Dr.\r\n Thomson has made the same remark, and when in Switzerland together we\r\n were assured by Auguste Balmat, François Coutet, and other experienced\r\n Mont Blanc guides, that they never witnessed these symptoms nor the\r\n blackness of the sky, so frequently insisted upon by alpine\r\n travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was fine, but intensely cold, and the vault of heaven was\r\nvery dark, and blazing with stars; the sir was electrical, and flash\r\nlightning illumined the sky; this was the reflection of a storm that\r\nwas not felt at Dorjiling, but which raged on the plains of India,\r\nbeyond the Terai, fully 120 miles, and perhaps 150, south of our\r\nposition. No thunder was heard. The thermometer fell to 5°, and that in\r\nthe reflector to 3.5°; at sunrise it rose to 10°, and soon after 8 a.m.\r\nto 33°; till this hour the humidity was great, and a thin mist hung\r\nover the frozen surface of the rocky ground; when this dispersed, the\r\nair became very dry, and the black-bulb thermometer in the sun rose 60°\r\nabove the temperature in the shade. The light of the sun, though\r\nsometimes intercepted by vapours aloft, was very brilliant.[273]\r\n\r\n [273] My black glass photometer shut out the sun’s disc at 10.509\r\n inches, from the mean of four sets of observations taken between 7 and\r\n 10 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis being the migrating season, swallows flitted through the air;\r\nfinches, larches, and sparrows were hopping over the sterile soil,\r\nseeking food, though it was difficult to say what. The geese[274] which\r\nhad roosted by the river, cackled; the wild ducks quacked and plumed\r\nthemselves; ouzels and waders screamed or chirped; and all rejoiced as\r\nthey prepared themselves for the last flight of the year, to the\r\nvalleys of the southern Himalaya, to the Teesta, and other rivers of\r\nthe Terai and plains of India.\r\n\r\n [274] An enormous quantity of water-fowl breed in Tibet, including\r\n many Indian species that migrate no further north. The natives collect\r\n their eggs for the markets at Jigatzi, Giantchi, and Lhassa, along the\r\n banks of the Yarn river, Ramchoo, and Yarbru and Dochen lakes. Amongst\r\n other birds the Sara, or great crane of India (see “Turner’s Tibet,”\r\n p. 212), repairs to these enormous elevations to breed. The fact of\r\n birds characteristic of the tropics dwelling for months in such\r\n climates is a very instructive one, and should be borne in mind in our\r\n speculations upon the climate supposed to be indicated by the imbedded\r\n bones of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dingpun paid his respects to us in the morning, wearing, besides\r\nhis green cloak, a white cap with a green glass button, denoting his\r\nrank; he informed us that he had written to his superior officer at\r\nKambajong, explaining his motives for conducting us across the\r\nfrontier, and he drew from his breast a long letter, written on\r\n_Daphne_[275] paper, whose ends were tied with floss silk, with a large\r\nred seal; this he pompously delivered, with whispered orders, to an\r\nattendant, and sent him off. He admired our clothes extremely,[276] and\r\nthen my percussion gun, the first he had seen; but above all he admired\r\nrum and water, which he drank with intense relish, leaving a mere sip\r\nfor his comrades at the bottom of his little wooden cup, which they\r\nemptied, and afterwards licked clean, and replaced in his breast for\r\nhim. We made a large basin full of very weak grog for his party, who\r\nwere all friendly and polite; and having made us the unexpected offer\r\nof allowing us to rest ourselves for the day at Yeumtso, he left us,\r\nand practised his men at firing at a mark, but they were very\r\nindifferent shots.\r\n\r\n [275] Most of the paper used in Tibet is, as I have elsewhere noticed,\r\n made from the bark of various species of _Daphneæ,_ and especially of\r\n _Edgeworthia Gardneri,_ and is imported from Nepal and Bhotan; but the\r\n Tibetans, as MM. Huc and Gabet correctly state, manufacture a paper\r\n from the root of a small shrub: this I have seen, and it is of a much\r\n thicker texture and more durable than Daphne paper. Dr. Thomson\r\n informs me that a species of _Astragalus_ is used in western Tibet for\r\n this purpose, the whole shrub, which is dwarf, being reduced to pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n [276] All Tibetans admire sad value English broad-cloth beyond any of\r\n our products. Woollen articles are very familiar to them, and warm\r\n clothing is one of the first requisites of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ascended with Campbell to the lake he had visited on the previous\r\nday, about 600 or 800 feet above Yeumtso, and 17,500 feet above the\r\nsea: it is a mile and a half long, and occupies a large depression\r\nbetween two rounded spurs, being fed by glaciers from Kinchinjhow. The\r\nrocks of these spurs were all of red quartz and slates, cut into broad\r\nterraces, covered with a thick glacial talus of gneiss and granite in\r\nangular pebbles, and evidently spread over the surface when the\r\nglacier, now occupying the upper end of the lake, extended over the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nThe ice on the cliffs and summit of Kinchinjhow was much greener and\r\nclearer than that on the south face (opposite Palung); and rows of\r\nimmense icicles hung from the cliffs. A conferva grew in the waters of\r\nthe lake, and short, hard tufts of sedge on the banks, but no other\r\nplants were to be seen. Brahminee geese, teal, and widgeon, were\r\nswimming in the waters, and a beetle (_Elaphrus_) was coursing over the\r\nwet banks; finches and other small birds were numerous, eating the\r\nsedge-seeds, and picking up the insects. No view was obtained to the\r\nnorth, owing to the height of the mountains on the north flank of the\r\nLachen.\r\n\r\nAt noon the temperature rose to 52·5°, and the black-bulb to 104·5°;\r\nwhilst the north-west dusty wind was so dry, that the dew-point fell to\r\n24·2°.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\n\r\nAscent of Bhomtso—View of snowy mountains—Chumulari—Arun\r\nriver—Kiang-lah mountains—Jigatzi—Lhama—Dingcham province of\r\nTibet—Misapplication of term “Plain of Tibet”—Sheep, flocks\r\nof—Crops—Probable elevation of Jigatzi—Yarn—Tsampu river—Tame\r\nelephants—Wild horses—Dryness of air—Sunset beams—Rocks of\r\nKinchinjhow—Cholamoo lakes—Limestone—Dip and strike of rocks—Effects of\r\ngreat elevation on party—Ascent of Donkia—Moving piles of débris—Cross\r\nDonkia pass—Second Visit to Momay Samdong—Hot springs—Descent to\r\nYeumtong—Lachoong—Retardation of vegetation again noticed—Jerked\r\nmeat—Fish—Lose a thermometer—Lepcha lad sleeps in hot\r\nspring—Keadom—_Bucklandia_—Arrive at\r\nChoongtam—Mendicant—Meepo—Lachen-Lachoong river—Wild grape—View from\r\nSingtam of Kinchinjunga—Virulent nettle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we crossed the valley, and ascended Bhomtso, fording\r\nthe river, whose temperature was 48°. Some stupendous boulders of\r\ngneiss from Kinchinjhow are deposited in a broad sandy track on the\r\nnorth bank, by ancient glaciers, which once crossed this valley from\r\nKinchinjhow.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was alternately over steep rocky slopes, and broad\r\nshelf-like flats; many more plants grew here than I had expected, in\r\ninconspicuous scattered tufts.[277] The rocks were nearly vertical\r\nstrata of quartz, hornstone, and conglomerate, striking north-west, and\r\ndipping south-west 80°. The broad top of the hill was also of quartz,\r\nbut covered with angular pebbles of the rocks transported from\r\nKinchinjhow. Some clay-stone fragments were stained red with oxide of\r\niron, and covered with _Parmelia miniata_;[278] this, with _Borrera,_\r\nanother lichen, which forms stringy masses blown along by the wind,\r\nwere the only plants, and they are among the most alpine in the world.\r\n\r\n [277] Besides those before mentioned, there were Fescue-grass\r\n (_Festuca ovina_ of Scotland), a strong-scented silky wormwood\r\n (_Artemisia_), and round tufts of _Oxytropis chiliophylla,_ a kind of\r\n _Astralagus_ that inhabits eastern and western Tibet; this alone was\r\n green: it formed great circles on the ground, the centre decaying, and\r\n the annual shoots growing outwards, and thus constantly enlarging the\r\n circle. A woolly _Leontopodium, Androsace,_ and some other plants\r\n assumed nearly the same mode of growth. The rest of the vegetation\r\n consisted of a _Sedum, Nardostachys Jatamansi, Meconopsis horridula,_\r\n a slender _Androsace, Gnaphalium, Stipa, Salvia, Draba, Pedicularis,\r\n Potentilla_ or _Sibbaldia, Gentiana_ and _Erigeron alpinus_ of\r\n Scotland. All these grow nearly up to 18,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [278] This minute lichen, mentioned at chapter xxxii, is the most\r\n Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine in the world; often occurring so\r\n abundantly as to colour the rocks of an orange red. This was the case\r\n at Bhomtso, and is so also in Cockburn Island in the Antarctic ocean,\r\n which it covers so profusely that the rocks look as if brightly\r\n painted. See “Ross’s Voyage,” vol. ii. p. 339.\r\n\r\n\r\nBhomtso is 18,590 feet above the sea by barometer, and 18,305 by\r\nboiling-point: it presented an infinitely more extensive prospect than\r\nI had ventured to anticipate, commanding all the most important Sikkim,\r\nNorth Bhotan, and Tibetan mountains, including Kinchinjunga\r\nthirty-seven miles to the south-west, and Chumulari thirty-nine miles\r\nsouth-east. Due south, across the sandy valley of the Lachen,\r\nKinchinjhow reared its long wall of glaciers and rugged precipices,\r\n22,000 feet high, and under its cliffs lay the lake to which we had\r\nwalked in the morning: beyond Kongra Lama were the Thlonok mountains,\r\nwhere I had spent the month of June, with Kinchinjunga in the distance.\r\nWestward Chomiomo rose abruptly from the rounded hills we were on, to\r\n22,000 feet elevation, ten miles distant. To the east of Kinchinjhow\r\nwere the Cholamoo lakes, with the rugged mass of Donkia stretching in\r\ncliffs of ice and snow continuously southwards to forked Donkia, which\r\noverhung Momay Samdong.\r\n\r\n\r\nKinchinjhow, Donkia and Cholamoo Lake, from the summit of Bhomtso,\r\nlooking south; the summit of Chumulari is introduced in the extreme\r\nleft of the view\r\n\r\nA long sloping spur sweeps from the north of Donkia first north, and\r\nthen west to Bhomtso, rising to a height of more than 20,000 feet\r\nwithout snow. Over this spur the celebrated Chumulari[279] peeps,\r\nbearing south-east, and from its isolated position and sharpness\r\nlooking low and small; it appeared quite near, though thirty-nine miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n [279] Some doubt still hangs over the identity of this mountain,\r\n chiefly owing to Turner’s having neglected to observe his geographical\r\n positions. I saw a much loftier mountain than this, bearing from\r\n Bhomtso north 87° east, and it was called Chumulari by the Tibetan\r\n Sepoys; but it does not answer to Turner’s description of an isolated\r\n snowy peak, such as he approached within three miles; and though in\r\n the latitude he assigned to it, is fully sixty miles to the east of\r\n his route. A peak, similar to the one he describes, is seen from\r\n Tonglo and Sinchul (see vol. i., p. 125 and p. 185); this is the one\r\n alluded to above, and it is identified by both Tibetans and Lepchas at\r\n Dorjiling as the true Chumulari, and was measured by Colonel Waugh,\r\n who placed it in lat. 27° 49′ north, long. 89° 18′ east. The latter\r\n position, though fifteen miles south of what Turner gives it, is\r\n probably correct; as Pemberton found that Turner had put other places\r\n in Bhotan twenty miles too far north. Moreover, in saying that it is\r\n visible from Purnea in the plains of Bengal, Turner refers to\r\n Kinchinjunga, whose elevation was then unknown. Dr. Campbell (“Bengal\r\n As. Soc. Jour.,” 1848), describes Chumulari from oral information, as\r\n an isolated mountain encircled by twenty-one goompas, and perambulated\r\n by pilgrims in five days; the Lachoong Phipun, on the other hand, who\r\n was a Lama, and well acquainted with the country, affirmed that\r\n Chumulari has many tops, and cannot be perambulated; but that detached\r\n peaks near it may be, and that it is to a temple near one of these\r\n that pilgrims resort. Again, the natives use these names very vaguely,\r\n and as that of Kinchinjunga is often applied equally to all or any\r\n part of the group of snows between the Lachen and Tambur rivers, so\r\n may the term Chumulari have been used vaguely to Captain Turner or to\r\n me. I have been told that an isolated, snow-topped, venerated mountain\r\n rises about twenty miles south of the true Chumulari, and is called\r\n “Sakya-khang” (Sakya’s snowy mountain), which may be that seen from\r\n Dorjiling; but I incline to consider Campbell’s and Waugh’s mountain\r\n as the one alluded to by Turner, and it is to it that I here refer as\r\n bearing north 115° 30′ east from Bhomtso.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth-east of Chumulari, and far beyond it, are several meridional\r\nranges of very much loftier snowy mountains, which terminated the view\r\nof the snowy Himalaya; the distance embraced being fully 150 miles, and\r\nperhaps much more. Of one of these eastern masses[280] I afterwards\r\ntook bearings and angular heights from the Khasia mountains, in Bengal,\r\nupwards of 200 miles south-east of its position.\r\n\r\n [280] These are probably the Ghassa mountains of Turners narrative:\r\n bearings which I took of one of the loftiest of them, from the Khasia\r\n mountains, together with those from Bhomtso, would appear to place it\r\n in latitude 28° 10′ and longitude 90°, and 200 miles from the former\r\n station, and 90° east of the latter. Its elevation from Bhomtso angles\r\n is 24,160 feet. I presume I also saw Chumulari from the Khasia; the\r\n most western peak seen thence being in the direction of that mountain.\r\n Captain R. Strachey has most kindly paid close attention to these\r\n bearings and distances, and recalculated the distances and heights: no\r\n confidence is, however, to be placed in the results of such minute\r\n angles, taken from immense distances. Owing in part no doubt to\r\n extraordinary refraction, the angles of the Ghassa mountain taken from\r\n the Khasia give it an elevation of 26,500 feet! which is very much\r\n over the truth; and make that of Chumulari still higher: the distance\r\n from my position in the Khasia being 210 miles from Chumulari! which\r\n is probably the utmost limit at which the human eye has ever discerned\r\n a terrestrial object.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning to the northward, a singular contrast in the view was\r\npresented: the broad sandy valley of the Arun lay a few miles off, and\r\nperhaps 1,500 feet below me; low brown and red ridges, 18,000 to 19,000\r\nfeet high, of stony sloping mountains with rocky tops, divided its\r\nfeeders, which appeared to be dry, and to occupy flat sandy valleys.\r\nFor thirty miles north no mountain was above the level of the\r\ntheodolite, and not a particle of snow was to be seen beyond that,\r\nrugged purple-flanked and snowy-topped mountains girdled the horizon,\r\nappearing no nearer than they did from the Donkia pass, and their\r\nangular heights and bearings being almost the same as from that point\r\nof view. The nearer of these are said to form the Kiang-lah chain, the\r\nfurthest I was told by different authorities are in the salt districts\r\nnorth of Jigatzi.\r\n\r\nTo the north-east was the lofty region traversed by Turner on his route\r\nby the Ramchoo lakes to Teshoo Loombo; its elevation may be 17,000\r\nfeet[281] above the sea. Beyond it a gorge led through rugged\r\nmountains, by which I was told the Painom river flows north-west to the\r\nYaru; and at an immense distance to the north-east were the Khamba\r\nmountains, a long blue range, which it is said divides the Lhassan or\r\n“U” from the “Tsang” (or Jigatzi) province of Tibet; it appeared fully\r\n100 miles off, and was probably much more; it bore from N. 57° E. to N.\r\n70° E., and though so lofty as to be heavily snowed throughout, was\r\nmuch below the horizon-line of Bhomtso; it is crossed on the route from\r\nJigatzi, and from Sikkim to Lhassa,[282] and is considered very lofty,\r\nfrom affecting the breathing. About twenty miles to the north-east are\r\nsome curious red conical mountains, said to be on the west side of the\r\nRamchoo lakes; they were unsnowed, and bore N. 45° 30′ E. and N. 60°\r\n30′ E. A sparingly-snowed group bore N. 26° 30′ E., and another N. 79°\r\nE., the latter being probably that mentioned by Turner as seen by him\r\nfrom near Giantchi.\r\n\r\n [281] It is somewhat remarkable that Turner nowhere alludes to\r\n difficulty of breathing, and in one place only to head-ache (p. 209)\r\n when at these great elevations. This is in a great measure accounted\r\n for by his having been constantly mounted. I never suffered either in\r\n my breathing, head, or stomach when riding, even when at 18,300 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [282] Lhassa, which lies north-east, may be reached in ten days from\r\n this, with relays of ponies; many mountains are crossed, where the\r\n breath is affected, and few villages are passed after leaving\r\n Giantchi, the “Jhansi jeung” of Turner’s narrative. See Campbell’s\r\n “Routes from Dorjiling to Lhassa.” (“Bengal As. Soc. Journal.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the mountains which appeared both the highest and the most distant\r\non the northern landscape, were those I described when at Donkia, as\r\nbeing north of Nepal and beyond the Arun river, and the culminant peak\r\nof which bore N. 55°. Both Dr. Campbell and I made repeated estimates\r\nof its height and distance by the eye; comparing its size and\r\nsnow-level with those of the mountains near us; and assuming 4000 to\r\n5000 feet as the minimum height of its snowy cap; this would give it an\r\nelevation of 23,000 to 25,000 feet. An excellent telescope brought out\r\nno features on its flanks not visible to the naked eye, and by the most\r\ncareful levellings with the theodolite, it was depressed more than 0°\r\n7′ below the horizon of Bhomtso, whence the distance must be above 100\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe transparency of the pale-blue atmosphere of these lofty regions can\r\nhardly be described, nor the clearness and precision with which the\r\nmost distant objects are projected against the sky. From having\r\nafterwards measured peaks 200 and 210 miles distant from the Khasia\r\nmountains, I feel sure that I underrated the estimates made at Bhomtso,\r\nand I have no hesitation in saying, that the mean elevation of the\r\nsparingly-snowed[283] watershed between the Yaru and the Arun will be\r\nfound to be greater than that of the snowy Himalaya south of it, and to\r\nfollow the chain running from Donkia, north of the Arun, along the\r\nKiang-lah mountains, towards the Nepal frontier, at Tingri Maidan. No\r\npart of that watershed perhaps rises so high as 24,000 feet, but its\r\nlowest elevation is probably nowhere under 18,000 feet.\r\n\r\n [283] Were the snow-level in Dingcham, as low as it is in Sikkim, the\r\n whole of Tibet from Donkia almost to the Yaru-Tsampu river would be\r\n everywhere intersected by glaciers and other impassable barriers of\r\n snow and ice, for a breadth of fifty miles, and the country would have\r\n no parallel for amount of snow beyond the Polar circles. It is\r\n impossible to conjecture what would have been the effects on the\r\n climate of northern India and central Asia under these conditions.\r\n When, however, we reflect upon the evidences of glacial phenomena that\r\n abound in all the Himalayan valleys at and above 9000 feet elevation,\r\n it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that such a state of things\r\n once existed, and that at a comparatively very recent period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis broad belt of lofty country, north of the snowy Himalaya, is the\r\nDingcham province of Tibet, and runs along the frontier of Sikkim,\r\nBhotan, and Nepal. It gives rise to all the Himalayan rivers, and its\r\nmean elevation is probably 15,000 to 15,500 feet: its general\r\nappearance, as seen from greater heights, is that of a much less\r\nmountainous country than the snowy and wet Himalayan regions; this is\r\nbecause its mean elevation is so enormous, that ranges of 20,000 to\r\n22,000 feet appear low and insignificant upon it. The absence of forest\r\nand other obstructions to the view, the breadth and flatness of the\r\nvalleys, and the undulating character of the lower ranges that traverse\r\nits surface, give it a comparatively level appearance, and suggest the\r\nterm “maidan” or “plains” to the Tibetan, when comparing his country\r\nwith the complicated ridges of the deep Sikkim valleys. Here one may\r\ntravel for many miles without rising or falling 3000 feet, yet never\r\ndescending below 14,000 feet, partly because the flat winding valleys\r\nare followed in preference to exhausting ascents, and partly because\r\nthe passes are seldom more than that elevation above the valleys;\r\nwhereas, in Sikkim, rises and descents of 6000, and even 9000 feet, are\r\ncommon in passing from valley to valley, sometimes in one day’s march.\r\n\r\nThe swarthy races of Dingcham have been elsewhere described; they are\r\nan honest, hospitable, and very hardy people, differing from the\r\nnorthern Tibetans chiefly in colour, and in invariably wearing the\r\npigtail, which MM. Huc and Gabet assure us is not usual in Lhassa.[284]\r\nThey are a pastoral race, and Campbell saw a flock of 400 hornless\r\nsheep, grazing on short sedges (_Carex_) and fescue-grass, in the\r\nmiddle of October, at 18,000 feet above the sea. An enormous ram\r\nattended the flock, whose long hair hung down to the ground; its back\r\nwas painted red.\r\n\r\n [284] Amongst Lhassan customs alluded to by these travellers, is that\r\n of the women smearing their faces with a black pigment, the object of\r\n which they affirm to be that they may render themselves odious to the\r\n male sex, and thus avoid temptation. The custom is common enough, but\r\n the real object is to preserve the skin, which the dry cold wind peels\r\n from the face. The pigment is mutton-fat, blackened, according to\r\n Tchebu Lama, with catechu and other ingredients; but I believe more\r\n frequently by the dirt of the face itself. I fear I do not slander the\r\n Tibetan damsels in saying that personal cleanliness and chastity are\r\n both lightly esteemed amongst them; and as the Lama naïvely remarked,\r\n when questioned on the subject, “the Tibetan women are not so\r\n different from those of other countries as to wish to conceal what\r\n charms they possess.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is neither tree nor shrub in this country; and a very little\r\nwheat (which seldom ripens), barley, turnips, and radishes are, I\r\nbelieve, the only crops, except occasionally peas. Other legumes,\r\ncabbages, etc., are cultivated in the sheltered valleys of the Yaru\r\nfeeders, where great heat is reflected from the rocks; and there also\r\nstunted trees grow, as willows, walnuts, poplars, and perhaps ashes;\r\nall of which, however, are said to be planted and scarce. Even at\r\nTeshoo Loombo and Jigatzi[285] buckwheat is a rare crop, and only a\r\nprostrate very hardy kind is grown. Clay teapots and pipkins are the\r\nmost valuable exports to Sikkim from the latter city, after salt and\r\nsoda. Jewels and woollen cloaks are also exported, the latter\r\nespecially from Giantchi, which is famous for its woollen fabrics and\r\nmart of ponies.\r\n\r\n [285] Digarchi, Jigatzi, or Shigatzi jong (the fort of Shigatzi) is\r\n the capital of the “Tsang” province, and Teshoo Loombo is the\r\n neighbouring city of temples and monasteries, the ecclesiastical\r\n capital of Tibet, and the abode of the grand (Teshoo) Lama, or\r\n ever-living Boodh. Whether we estimate this man by the number of his\r\n devotees, or the perfect sincerity of their worship, he is without\r\n exception one of the most honoured beings living in the world. I have\r\n assumed the elevation of Jigatzi to be 13–14,000 feet, using as data\r\n Turner’s October mean temperature of Teshoo Loombo, and the decrement\r\n for elevation of 400 feet to 1° Fahr.; which my own observations\r\n indicate as an approximation to the truth. Humboldt (“Asie Centrale,”\r\n iii., p. 223) uses a much smaller multiplier, and infers the elevation\r\n of Teshoo Loombo to be between 9,500 and 10,000 feet. Our data are far\r\n too imperfect to warrant any satisfactory conclusions on this\r\n interesting subject; but the accounts I have received of the\r\n vegetation of the Yaru valley at Jigatzi seem to indicate an elevation\r\n of at least 13,000 feet for the bed of that river. Of the elevation of\r\n Lhassa itself we have no idea: if MM. Huc and Gabet’s statement of the\r\n rivers not being frozen there in March be correct, the climate must be\r\n very different from what we suppose.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Yaru river at Jigatzi, which all affirm becomes the Burrampooter\r\nin Assam, I have little information to add to Turner’s description: it\r\nis sixty miles north of Bhomtso, and I assume its elevation to be\r\n13-14,000 feet;[286] it takes an immense bend to the northward after\r\npassing Jigatzi, and again turns south, flowing to the west of Lhassa,\r\nand at some distance from that capital. Lhassa, as all agree, is at a\r\nmuch lower elevation than Jigatzi; and apricots (whose ripe stones Dr.\r\nCampbell procured for me) and walnuts are said to ripen there, and the\r\nDama or Himalayan furze (_Caragana_), is said to grow there. The\r\nBactrian camel also thrives and breeds at Lhassa, together with a small\r\nvariety of cow (not the yak), both signs of a much more temperate\r\nclimate than Jigatzi enjoys. It is, however, a remarkable fact that\r\nthere are two tame elephants near the latter city, kept by the Teshoo\r\nLama. They were taken to Jigatzi, through Bhotan, by Phari; and I have\r\nbeen informed that they have become clothed with long hair, owing to\r\nthe cold of the climate; but Tchebu Lama contradicted this, adding,\r\nthat his countrymen were so credulous, that they would believe blankets\r\ngrew on the elephants’ backs, if the Lamas told them so.\r\n\r\n [286] The Yaru, which approaches the Nepal frontier west of Tingri,\r\n and beyond the great mountain described at vol. i. p. 265, makes a\r\n sweep to the northward, and turns south to Jigatzi, whence it makes\r\n another and greater bend to the north, and again turning south flows\r\n west of Lhassa, receiving the Kechoo river from that holy city. From\r\n Jigatzi it is said to be navigable to near Lhassa by skin and\r\n plank-built boats. Thence it flows south-east to the Assam frontier,\r\n and while still in Tibet, is said to enter a warm climate, where tea,\r\n silk, cotton, and rice, are grown. Of its course after entering the\r\n Assam Himalaya little is known, and in answer to my enquiries why it\r\n had not been followed, I was always told that the country through\r\n which it flowed was inhabited by tribes of savages, who live on snakes\r\n and vermin, and are fierce and warlike. These are no doubt the\r\n Singpho, Bor and Bor-abor tribes who inhabit the mountains of upper\r\n Assam. A travelling mendicant was once sent to follow up the Dihong to\r\n the Burrampooter, under the joint auspices of Mr. Hodgson and Major\r\n Jenkins, the Commissioner of Assam; but the poor fellow was speared on\r\n the frontier by these savages. The concurrent testimony of the\r\n Assamese, that the Dihong is the Yaru, on its southern course to\r\n become the Burrampooter, renders this point as conclusively settled as\r\n any, resting on mere oral evidence, is likely to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo village or house is seen throughout the extensive area over which\r\nthe eye roams from Bhomtso, and the general character of the desolate\r\nlandscape was similar to that which I have described as seen from\r\nDonkia Pass (p. 124). The wild ass[287] grazing with its foal on the\r\nsloping downs, the hare bounding over the stony soil, the antelope\r\nscouring the sandy flats, and the fox stealing along to his burrow, are\r\nall desert and Tartarian types of the animal creation. The shrill\r\nwhistle of the marmot alone breaks the silence of the scene, recalling\r\nthe snows of Lapland to the mind; the kite and raven wheel through the\r\nair, 1000 feet over head, with as strong and steady a pinion as if that\r\natmosphere possessed the same power of resistance that it does at the\r\nlevel of the sea. Still higher in the heavens, long black V-shaped\r\ntrains of wild geese cleave the air, shooting over the glacier-crowned\r\ntop of Kinchinjhow, and winging their flight in one day, perhaps, from\r\nthe Yaru to the Ganges, over 500 miles of space, and through 22,000\r\nfeet of elevation. One plant alone, the yellow lichen (_Borrera_), is\r\nfound at this height, and only as a visitor; for, Tartar-like, it\r\nemigrates over these lofty slopes and ridges, blown about by the\r\nviolent winds. I found a small beetle on the very top,[288] probably\r\nblown up also, for it was a flower-feeder, and seemed benumbed with\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n [287] This, the _Equus Hemionus_ of Pallas, the untameable Kiang of\r\n Tibet, abounds in Dingcham, and we saw several. It resembles the ass\r\n more than the horse, from its size, heavy head, small limbs, thin\r\n tail, and the stripe over the shoulder. The flesh is eaten and much\r\n liked. The Kiang-lah mountains are so named from their being a great\r\n resort of this creature. It differs widely from the wild ass of\r\n Persia, Sind, and Beloochistan, but is undoubtedly the same as the\r\n Siberian animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n [288] I observed a small red _Acarus_ (mite) at this elevation, both\r\n on Donkia and Kinchinjhow, which reminds me that I found a species of\r\n the same genus at Cockburn Island (in latitude 64° south, longitude\r\n 64° 49′ west). This genus hence inhabits a higher southern latitude\r\n than any other land animal attains.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery night that we spent in Tibet, we enjoyed a magnificent display of\r\nsunbeams converging to the east, and making a false sunset. I detailed\r\nthis phenomenon when seen from the Kymore mountains, and I repeatedly\r\nsaw it again in the Khasia, but never in the Sikkim Himalaya, whence I\r\nassume that it is most frequent in mountain plateaus. As the sun set,\r\nbroad purple beams rose from a dark, low, leaden bank on the eastern\r\nhorizon, and spreading up to the zenith, covered the intervening space:\r\nthey lasted through the twilight, from fifteen to twenty minutes,\r\nfading gradually into the blackness of night. I looked in vain for the\r\nbeautiful lancet beam of the zodiacal light; its position was obscured\r\nby Chomiomo.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of October we had another brilliant morning, after a cold\r\nnight, the temperature having fallen to 4°. I took the altitude of\r\nYeumtso by carefully boiling two thermometers, and the result was\r\n16,279 feet, the barometrical observations giving 16,808 feet. I\r\nremoved a thermometer sunk three feet in the gravelly soil, which\r\nshowed a temperature of 43°,[289] which is 12·7° above the mean\r\ntemperature of the two days we camped here.\r\n\r\n [289] It had risen to 43·5° during the previous day.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur fires were made of dry yak droppings which soon burn out with a\r\nfierce flame, and much black smoke; they give a disagreeable taste to\r\nwhatever is cooked with them.\r\n\r\nHaving sent the coolies forward to Cholamoo lake, we re-ascended\r\nBhomtso to verify my observations. As on the previous occasion a\r\nviolent dry north-west wind blew, peeling the skin from our faces,\r\nloading the air with grains of sand, and rendering theodolite\r\nobservations very uncertain; besides injuring all my instruments, and\r\nexposing them to great risk of breakage.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan Sepoys did not at all understand our ascending Bhomtso a\r\nsecond time; they ran after Campbell, who was ahead on a stout pony,\r\ngirding up their long garments, bracing their matchlocks tight over\r\ntheir shoulders, and gasping for breath at every step, the long horns\r\nof their muskets bobbing up and down as they toiled amongst the rocks.\r\nWhen I reached the top I found Campbell seated behind a little stone\r\nwall which he had raised to keep off the violent wind, and the uncouth\r\nwarriors in a circle round him, puzzled beyond measure at his\r\nadmiration of the view. My instruments perplexed them extremely, and in\r\ncrowding round me, they broke my azimuth compass. They left us to\r\nourselves when the fire I made to boil the thermometers went out, the\r\nwind being intensely cold. I had given my barometer to one of\r\nCampbell’s men to carry, who not coming up, the latter kindly went to\r\nsearch for him, and found him on the ground quite knocked up and\r\nstupified by the cold, and there, if left alone, he would have lain\r\ntill overtaken by death.\r\n\r\nThe barometer on the summit of Bhomtso stood at 15·548 inches;[290] the\r\ntemperature between 11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. fluctuated between 44° and\r\n56°: this was very high for so great an elevation, and no doubt due to\r\nthe power of the sun on the sterile soil, and consequent radiated heat.\r\nThe tension of vapour was ·0763, and the dew-point was 5·8°, or 43·5°\r\nbelow the temperature of the air. Such extraordinary dryness[291] and\r\nconsequent evaporation, increased by the violent wind, sufficiently\r\naccounts for the height of the snow line; in further evidence of which,\r\nI may add that a piece of ice or snow laid on the ground here, does not\r\nmelt, but disappears by evaporation.\r\n\r\n [290] The elevation of Bhomtso, worked by Bessel’s tables, and using\r\n corrected observations of the Calcutta barometer for the lower\r\n station, is 18,590 feet. The corresponding dew-point 4·4° (49·6° below\r\n that of the air at the time of observation). By Oltmann’s tables the\r\n elevation is 18,540 feet. The elevation by boiling water is 18,305.\r\n\r\n\r\n [291] The weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air was no more than\r\n ·087 of a grain, and the saturation-point ·208.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference between the dry cold air of this elevation and that of\r\nthe heated plains of India, is very great. During the driest winds of\r\nthe Terai, in spring, the temperature is 80° to 90°, the tension of\r\nvapour is .400 to .500, with a dew-point 22° below the temperature, and\r\nupwards of six grains of vapour are suspended in the cubic foot of air;\r\na thick haze obscures the heavens, and clouds of dust rise high in the\r\nair; here on the other hand (probably owing to the rarity of the\r\natmosphere and the low tension of its vapours), the drought is\r\naccompanied by perfect transparency, and the atmosphere is too\r\nattenuated to support the dust raised by the wind.\r\n\r\nWe descended in the afternoon, and on our way up the Lachen valley\r\nexamined a narrow gulley in a lofty red spur from Kinchinjhow, where\r\nblack shales were _in situ,_ striking north-east, and dipping\r\nnorth-west 45°. These shales were interposed between beds of yellow\r\nquartz conglomerate, upon the latter of which rested a talus of earthy\r\nrocks, angular fragments of which were strewed about opposite this\r\nspur, but were not seen elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt became dark before we reached the Cholamoo lake, where we lost our\r\nway amongst glaciers, moraines, and marshes. We expected to have seen\r\nthe lights of the camp, but were disappointed, and as it was freezing\r\nhard, we began to be anxious, and shouted till the echos of our voices\r\nagainst the opposite bank were heard by Tchebu Lama, who met us in\r\ngreat alarm for our safety. Our camp was pitched some way from the\r\nshore, on a broad plain, 16,900 feet above the sea.[292] A cold wind\r\ndescended from Donkia; yet, though more elevated than Yeumtso, the\r\nclimate of Cholamoo, from being damper and misty, was milder. The\r\nminimum thermometer fell to 14°.\r\n\r\n [292] This, which is about the level of the lake, gives the Lachen\r\n river a fall of about 1,500 feet between its source and Kongra Lama,\r\n or sixty feet per mile following its windings. From Kongra Lama to\r\n Tallum it is 140 feet per mile; from Tallum to Singtam 160 feet; and\r\n from Singtam to the plains of India 50 feet per mile. The total fall\r\n from Cholamoo lake to its exit on the plains of India is eighty-five\r\n feet per mile. Its length, following its windings, is 195 miles,\r\n upwards of double the direct distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore starting for Donkia pass on the following morning, we visited\r\nsome black rocks which rose from the flat to the east of the lake. They\r\nproved to be of fossiliferous limestone, the strata of which were much\r\ndisturbed: the strike appeared in one part north-west, and the dip\r\nnorth-east 45°: a large fault passed east by north through the cliff,\r\nand it was further cleft by joints running northwards. The cliff was\r\nnot 100 yards long, and was about 70 thick; its surface was shivered by\r\nfrost into cubical masses, and glacial boulders of gneiss lay on the\r\ntop. The limestone rock was chiefly a blue pisolite conglomerate, with\r\nveins and crystals of white carbonate of lime, seams of shale, and iron\r\npyrites. A part was compact and blue, very crystalline, and full of\r\nencrinitic fossils, and probably nummulites, but all were too much\r\naltered for determination.\r\n\r\nThis, from its mineral characters, appears to be the same limestone\r\nformation which occurs throughout the Himalaya and Western Tibet; but\r\nthe fossils I collected are in too imperfect a state to warrant any\r\nconclusions on this subject. Its occurrence immediately to the\r\nnorthward of the snowy mountains, and in such very small quantities,\r\nare very remarkable facts. The neighbouring rocks of Donkia were gneiss\r\nwith granite veins, also striking north-west and dipping north-east\r\n10°, as if they overlay the limestone, but here as in all similar\r\nsituations there was great confusion of the strata, and variation in\r\ndirection and strike.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may once for all confess that though I believe the general\r\nstrike of the rocks on this frontier to be north-west, and the dip\r\nnorth-east, I am unable to affirm it positively; for though I took\r\nevery opportunity of studying the subject, and devoted many hours to\r\nthe careful measuring and recording of dips and strikes, on both faces\r\nof Kinchinjhow, Donkia, Bhomtso, and Kongra Lama, I am unable to reduce\r\nthese to any intelligible system.[293]\r\n\r\n [293] North-west is the prevalent strike in Kumaon, the north-west\r\n Himalaya generally, and throughout Western Tibet, Kashmir, etc.,\r\n according to Dr. Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coolies of Dr. Campbell’s party were completely knocked up by the\r\nrarified air; they had taken a whole day to march here from Yeumtso,\r\nscarcely six miles, and could eat no food at night. A Lama of our party\r\noffered up prayers[294] to Kinchinjhow for the recovery of a stout\r\nLepcha lad (called Nurko), who showed no signs of animation, and had\r\nall the symptoms of serous apoplexy. The Lama perched a saddle on a\r\nstone, and burning incense before it, scattered rice to the winds,\r\ninvoking Kinchin, Donkia, and all the neighbouring peaks. A strong dose\r\nof calomel and jalap, which we poured down the sick lad’s throat,\r\ncontributed materially to the success of these incantations.\r\n\r\n [294] All diseases are attributed by the Tibetans to the four\r\n elements, who are propitiated accordingly in cases of severe illness.\r\n The winds are invoked in cases of affections of the breathing; fire in\r\n fevers and inflammations; water in dropsy, and diseases whereby the\r\n fluids are affected; and the God of earth when solid organs are\r\n diseased, as in liver-complaints, rheumatism, etc. Propitiatory\r\n offerings are made to the deities of these elements, but never\r\n sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan Sepoys were getting tired of our delays, which so much\r\nfavoured my operations; but though showing signs of impatience and\r\nsulkiness, they behaved well to the last; taking the sick man to the\r\ntop of the pass on their yaks, and assisting all the party: nothing,\r\nhowever, would induce them to cross into Sikkim, which they considered\r\nas “Company’s territory.”\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the pass, I turned off to the east, and\r\nre-ascended Donkia to upwards of 19,000 feet, vainly hoping to get a\r\nmore distant view, and other bearings of the Tibetan mountains. The\r\nascent was over enormous piles of loose rocks split by the frost, and\r\nwas extremely fatiguing. I reached a peak overhanging a steep\r\nprecipice, at whose base were small lakes and glaciers, from which\r\nflowed several sources of the Lachen, afterwards swelled by the great\r\naffluent from Cholamoo lake. A few rocks striking north-east and\r\ndipping north-west, projected at the very summit, with frozen snow\r\namongst them, beyond which the ice and precipices rendered it\r\nimpossible to proceed: but though exposed to the north, there was no\r\nperpetual snow in the ordinary acceptation of the term, and an arctic\r\nEuropean lichen (_Lecidea oreina_) grew on the top, so faintly\r\ndiscolouring the rocks as hardly to be detected without a\r\nmagnifying-glass.\r\n\r\nI descended obliquely, down a very steep slope of 35°, over upwards of\r\na thousand feet of débris, the blocks on which were so loosely poised\r\non one another, that it was necessary to proceed with the utmost\r\ncircumspection, for I was alone, and a false step would almost\r\ncertainly have been followed by breaking a leg. The alternate freezing\r\nand thawing of rain amongst these masses, must produce a constant\r\ndownward motion in the whole pile of débris (which was upwards of 2000\r\nfeet high), and may account for the otherwise unexplained phenomenon of\r\ncontinuous shoots of angular rocks reposing on very gentle slopes in\r\nother places.[295]\r\n\r\n [295] May not the origin of the streams of quartz blocks that fill\r\n gently sloping broad valleys several miles long, in the Falkland\r\n Islands, be thus explained? (See “Darwin’s Journal,” in Murray’s Home\r\n and Col. Lib.) The extraordinary shifting in the position of my\r\n thermometer left among the rocks of the Donkia pass (see p. 129), and\r\n the mobile state of the slopes I descended on this occasion, first\r\n suggested this explanation to me. When in the Falkland Islands I was\r\n wholly unable to offer any explanation of the phenomenon there, to\r\n which my attention had been drawn by Mr. Darwin’s narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe north ascent to the Donkia pass is by a path well selected amongst\r\nimmense angular masses of rock, and over vast piles of débris: the\r\nstrike on this, the north face, was again north-east, and dip\r\nnorth-west: I arrived at the top at 3 p.m., throughly fatigued, and\r\nfound my faithful Lepcha lads (Cheytoong and Bassebo) nestling under a\r\nrock with my theodolite and barometers, having been awaiting my arrival\r\nin the biting wind for three hours. My pony stood there too, the\r\npicture of patience, and laden with minerals. After repeating my\r\nobservations, I proceeded to Momay Samdong, where I arrived after dusk.\r\nI left a small bottle of brandy and some biscuits with the lads, and it\r\nwas well I did so, for the pony knocked up before reaching Momay, and\r\nrather than leave my bags of stones, they passed the night by the warm\r\nflank of the beast, under a rock at 18,000 feet elevation, without\r\nother food, fire, or shelter.\r\n\r\nI found my companion encamped at Momay, on the spot I had occupied in\r\nSeptember; he had had the utmost difficulty in getting his coolies on,\r\nas they threw down their light loads in despair, and lying with their\r\nfaces to the ground, had to be roused from a lethargy that would soon\r\nhave been followed by death.\r\n\r\nWe rested for a day at Momay, and on the 20th, attempted to ascend to\r\nthe Donkia glacier, but were driven back by a heavy snow-storm. The\r\nscenery on arriving here, presented a wide difference to that we had\r\nleft; snow lying at 16,500 feet, whereas immediately to the north of\r\nthe same mountain there was none at 19,000 feet. Before leaving Momay;\r\nI sealed two small glass flasks containing the air of this elevation,\r\nby closing with a spirit lamp a very fine capillary tube, which formed\r\nthe opening to each; avoiding the possibility of heating the contents\r\nby the hand or otherwise. The result of its analysis by Mr. Muller (who\r\nsent me the prepared flasks), was that it contained 36·538 per cent. in\r\nvolume of oxygen; whereas his repeated analysis of the air of Calcutta\r\ngives 21 per cent. Such a result is too anomalous to be considered\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nI again visited the Kinchinjhow glacier and hot springs; the water had\r\nexactly the same temperature as in the previous month, though the mean\r\ntemperature of the air was 8° or 9° lower. The minimum thermometer fell\r\nto 22°, being 10° lower than it ever fell in September.\r\n\r\nWe descended to Yeumtong in a cold drizzle, arriving by sunset; we\r\nremained through the following day, hoping to explore the lower glacier\r\non the opposite side of the valley: which, however, the weather\r\nentirely prevented. I have before mentioned (p. 140) that in descending\r\nin autumn from the drier and more sunny rearward Sikkim valleys, the\r\nvegetation is found to be most backward in the lowest and dampest\r\nregions. On this occasion, I found asters, grasses, polygonums, and\r\nother plants that were withered, brown, and seeding at Momay (14,000 to\r\n15,000 feet), at Yeumtong (12,000 feet) green and unripe; and 2000 feet\r\nlower still, at Lachoong, the contrast was even more marked. Thus the\r\nshort backward spring and summer of the Arctic zone is overtaken by an\r\nearly and forward seed-time and winter: so far as regards the effects\r\nof mean temperature, the warmer station is in autumn more backward than\r\nthe colder. This is everywhere obvious in the prevalent plants of each,\r\nand is especially recognisable in the rhododendrons; as the following\r\ntable shows:—\r\n\r\n16,000 to 17,000 feet, _R. nivale_ flowers in July; fruits in September\r\n= 2 months.\r\n13,000 to 14,000 feet, _R. anthopogon_ flowers in June; fruits in Oct.\r\n= 4 months.\r\n11,000 to 12,000 feet, _R. campanulatum_ flowers in May; fruits in Nov.\r\n= 8 months.\r\n8,000 to 9,000 feet, _R. argenteum_ flowers in April; fruits in Dec. =\r\n8 months.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so it is with many species of _Compositæ_ and _Umbelliferæ,_ and\r\nindeed of all natural orders, some of which I have on the same day\r\ngathered in ripe fruit at 13,000 to 14,000 feet, and found still in\r\nflower at 9000 to 10,000 feet. The brighter skies and more powerful and\r\nfrequent solar radiation at the greater elevations, account for this\r\napparent inversion of the order of nature.[296]\r\n\r\n [296] The distribution of the seasons at different elevations in the\r\n Himalaya gives rise to some anomalies that have puzzled naturalists.\r\n From the middle of October to that of May, vegetation is torpid above\r\n 14,000 feet, and indeed almost uniformly covered with snow. From\r\n November till the middle of April, vegetation is also torpid above\r\n 10,000 feet, except that a few trees and bushes do not ripen all their\r\n seeds till December. The three winter months (December, January, and\r\n February) are all but dead above 6000 feet, the earliest appearance of\r\n spring at Dorjiling (7000 feet) being at the sudden accession of heat\r\n in March. From May till August the vegetation at each elevation is (in\r\n ascending order) a month behind that below it; 4000 feet being about\r\n equal to a month of summer weather in one sense. I mean by this, that\r\n the genera and natural orders (and sometimes the species) which flower\r\n at 8000 feet in May, are not so forward at 12,000 feet till June, nor\r\n at 16,000 feet till July. After August, however, the reverse holds\r\n good; then the vegetation is as forward at 16,000 feet as at 8000\r\n feet. By the end of September most of the natural orders and genera\r\n have ripened their fruit in the upper zone, though they have flowered\r\n as late as July; whereas October is the fruiting month at 12,000, and\r\n November below 10,000 feet. Dr. Thomson does not consider that the\r\n more sunny climate of the loftier elevations sufficiently accounts for\r\n this, and adds the stimulus of cold, which must act by checking the\r\n vegetative organs and hastening maturation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was disappointed at finding the rhododendron seeds still immature at\r\nYeumtong, for I was doubtful whether the same kinds might be met with\r\nat the Chola pass, which I had yet to visit; besides which, their tardy\r\nmaturation threatened to delay me for an indefinite period in the\r\ncountry. _Viburnum_ and _Lonicera,_ however, were ripe and abundant;\r\nthe fruits of both are considered poisonous in Europe, but here the\r\nblack berries of a species of the former (called “Nalum”) are eatable\r\nand agreeable; as are those of a _Gualtheria,_ which are pale blue, and\r\ncalled “Kalumbo.” Except these, and the cherry mentioned above, there\r\nare no other autumnal fruits above 10,000 feet: brambles, strange as it\r\nmay appear, do not ascend beyond that elevation in the Sikkim Himalaya,\r\nthough so abundant below it, both in species and individuals, and\r\nthough so typical of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nAt Lachoong we found all the yaks that had been grazing till the end of\r\nSeptember at the higher elevations, and the Phipun presented our men\r\nwith one of a gigantic size, and proportionally old and tough. The\r\nLepchas barbarously slaughtered it with arrows, and feasted on the\r\nflesh and entrails, singed and fried the skin, and made soup of the\r\nbones, leaving nothing but the horns and hoofs. Having a fine day, they\r\nprepared some as jerked meat, cutting it into thin strips, which they\r\ndried on the rocks. This (called “Schat-chew,” dried meat) is a very\r\ncommon and favourite food in Tibet, I found it palatable; but on the\r\nother hand, the dried saddles of mutton, of which they boast so much,\r\ntaste so strongly of tallow, that I found it impossible to swallow a\r\nmorsel of them.[297]\r\n\r\n [297] Raw dried split fish are abundantly cured (without salt) in\r\n Tibet; they are caught in the Yaru and great lakes of Ramchoo, Dobtah,\r\n and Yarbru, and are chiefly carp, and allied fish, which attain a\r\n large size. It is one of the most remarkable facts in the zoology of\r\n Asia, that no trout or salmon inhabits any of the rivers that débouche\r\n into the Indian Ocean (the so-called Himalayan trout is a species of\r\n carp). This widely distributed natural order of fish (_Salmonidæ_) is\r\n however, found in the Oxus, and in all the rivers of central Asia that\r\n flow north and west, and the _Salmo orientalis,_ M’Clelland (“Calcutta\r\n Journ. Nat. Hist.” iii., p. 283), was caught by Mr. Griffith\r\n (Journals, p. 404) in the Bamean river (north of the Hindo Koosh)\r\n which flows into the Oxus, and whose waters are separated by one\r\n narrow mountain ridge from those of the feeders of the Indus. The\r\n central Himalayan rivers often rise in Tibet from lakes full of fish,\r\n but have none (at least during the rains) in that rapid part of their\r\n course from 10,000 to 14,000 feet elevation: below that fish abound,\r\n but I believe invariably of different species from those found at the\r\n sources of the same rivers. The nature of the tropical ocean into\r\n which all the Himalayan rivers débouche, is no doubt the proximate\r\n cause of the absence of _Salmonidæ._ Sir John Richardson (Fishes of\r\n China Seas, etc., “in Brit. Ass. Rep. etc.”), says that no species of\r\n the order has been found in the Chinese or eastern Asiatic seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe staid two days at Lachoong, two of my lads being again laid up with\r\nfever; one of them had been similarly attacked at the same place nearly\r\ntwo months before: the other lad had been repeatedly ill since June,\r\nand at all elevations. Both cases were returns of a fever caught in the\r\nlow unhealthy valleys some months previously, and excited by exposure\r\nand hardship. The vegetation at Lachoong was still beautiful, and the\r\nweather mild, though snow had descended to 14,000 feet on Tunkra.\r\n_Compositæ_ were abundantly in flower, apples in young fruit, bushes of\r\n_Cotoneaster_ covered with scarlet berries, and the brushwood silvery\r\nwith the feathery heads of _Clematis._\r\n\r\nI here found that I had lost a thermometer for high temperatures, owing\r\nto a hole in the bag in which Cheytoong carried those of my instruments\r\nwhich were in constant use. It had been last used at the hot springs of\r\nthe Kinchinjhow glacier; and the poor lad was so concerned at his\r\nmishap, that he came to me soon afterwards, with his blanket on his\r\nback, and a few handfuls of rice in a bag, to make his salaam before\r\nsetting out to search for it. There was not now a single inhabitant\r\nbetween Lachoong and that dreary spot, and strongly against my wish he\r\nstarted, without a companion. Three days afterwards he overtook us at\r\nKeadom, radiant with joy at having found the instrument: he had gone up\r\nto the hot springs, and vainly sought around them that evening; then\r\nrather than lose the chance of a day-light search on his way back, he\r\nhad spent the cold October night in the hot water, without fire or\r\nshelter, at 16,000 feet above the sea. Next morning his search was\r\nagain fruitless; and he was returning disconsolate, when he descried\r\nthe brass case glistening between two planks of the bridge crossing the\r\nriver at Momay, over which torrent the instrument was suspended. The\r\nLepchas have generally been considered timorous of evil spirits, and\r\nespecially averse to travelling at night, even in company. However\r\nlittle this gallant lad may have been given to superstition, he was\r\nnevertheless a Lepcha, born in a warm region, and had never faced the\r\ncold till he became my servant; and it required a stout heart and an\r\nhonest one, to spend a night in so awful a solitude as that which\r\nreigns around the foot of the Kinchinjhow glacier.[298]\r\n\r\n [298] The fondness of natives for hot springs wherever they occur is\r\n very natural and has been noticed by Humboldt, “Pers. Narr.” iv. 195,\r\n who states that on Christianity being introduced into Iceland, the\r\n natives refused to be baptised in any but the water of the Geysers. I\r\n have mentioned at p. 117 the uses to which the Yeumtong hot springs\r\n are put; and the custom of using artificial hot baths is noticed at\r\n vol. i., p. 305.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe villagers at Keadom, where we slept on the 26th, were busy cutting\r\nthe crops of millet, maize, and _Amaranthus._ A girl who, on my way\r\ndown the previous month, had observed my curiosity about a singular\r\nvariety of the maize, had preserved the heads on their ripening, and\r\nnow brought them to me. The peaches were all gathered, and though only\r\nhalf ripe, were better than Dorjiling produce. A magnificent tree of\r\n_Bucklandia,_ one of the most beautiful evergreens in Sikkim, grew near\r\nthis village; it had a trunk twenty-one feet seven inches in girth, at\r\nfive feet from the ground, and was unbranched for forty feet.[299]\r\nFerns and the beautiful air-plant _Cœlogyne Wallichii_ grew on its\r\nbranches, with other orchids, while _Clematis_ and _Stauntonia_ climbed\r\nthe trunk. Such great names (Buckland, Staunton, and Wallich) thus\r\nbrought before the traveller’s notice, never failed to excite lively\r\nand pleasing emotions: it is the ignorant and unfeeling alone who can\r\nridicule the association of the names of travellers and naturalists\r\nwith those of animals and plants.\r\n\r\n [299] This superb tree is a great desideratum in our gardens; I\r\n believe it would thrive in the warm west of England. Its wood is\r\n brown, and not valuable as timber, but the thick, bright, glossy,\r\n evergreen foliage is particularly handsome, and so is the form of the\r\n crown. It is also interesting in a physiological point of view, from\r\n the woody fibre being studded with those curious microscopic discs so\r\n characteristic of pines, and which when occurring on fossil wood are\r\n considered conclusive as to the natural family to which such woods\r\n belong. Geologists should bear in mind that not only does the whole\r\n natural order to which _Bucklandia_ belongs, possess this character,\r\n but also various species of _Magnoliaceæ_ found in India, Australia,\r\n Borneo, and South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Choongtam (for the fourth time) at noon, and took up our\r\nquarters in a good house near the temple. The autumn and winter\r\nflowering plants now prevailed here, such as _Labiatæ,_ which are\r\ngenerally late at this elevation; and grasses, which, though rare in\r\nthe damp forest regions, are so common on these slopes that I here\r\ngathered twenty-six kinds. I spent a day here in order to collect seeds\r\nof the superb rhododendrons[300] which I had discovered in May, growing\r\non the hills behind. The ascent was now difficult, from the length of\r\nthe wiry grass, which rendered the slopes so slippery that it was\r\nimpossible to ascend without holding on by the tussocks.\r\n\r\n [300] These Rhododendrons are now all flourishing at Kew and\r\n elsewhere: they are _R. Dalhousiæ, arboreum, Maddeni, Edgeworthii,\r\n Aucklandii_ and _virgatum._\r\n\r\n\r\nA ragged Tibetan mendicant (Phud) was amusing the people: he put on a\r\nblack mask with cowrie shells for eyes, and danced uncouth figures with\r\na kind of heel and toe shuffle, in excellent time, to rude Tibetan\r\nsongs of his own: for this he received ample alms, which a little boy\r\ncollected in a wallet. These vagrants live well upon charity; they\r\nbless, curse, and transact little affairs of all kinds up and down the\r\nvalleys of Sikkim and Tibet; this one dealt in red clay teapots, sheep\r\nand puppies.\r\n\r\nWe found Meepo at Choongtam: I had given him leave (when here last) to\r\ngo back to the Rajah, and to visit his wife; and he had returned with\r\ninstructions to conduct me to the Chola and Yakla passes, in Eastern\r\nSikkim. These passes, like that of Tunkra (p. 110), lead over the Chola\r\nrange to that part of Tibet which is interposed between Sikkim and\r\nBhotan. My road lay past the Rajah’s residence, which we considered\r\nvery fortunate, as apparently affording Campbell an opportunity of a\r\nconference with his highness, for which both he and the Tchebu Lama\r\nwere most anxious.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibetan Phud]\r\n\r\nOn the way down the Lachen-Lachoong, we found the valley still flooded\r\n(as described at p. 20 and p. 146), and the alders standing with their\r\ntrunks twelve feet under water; but the shingle dam was now dry and\r\nhard: it would probably soften, and be carried away by the first rains\r\nof the following year. I left here the temperate flora of northern\r\nSikkim, tropical forms commencing to appear: of these the nettle tribe\r\nwere most numerous in the woods. A large grape, with beautiful clusters\r\nof round purple berries, was very fair eating; it is not the common\r\nvine of Europe, which nevertheless is probably an Himalayan plant, the\r\n_Vitis Indica._[301]\r\n\r\n [301] The origin of the common grape being unknown, it becomes a\r\n curious question to decide whether the Himalayan _Vitis Indica_ is the\r\n wild state of that plant: an hypothesis strengthened by the fact of\r\n Bacchus, etc., having come from the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Chakoong the temperature of the river, which in May was 54°, was now\r\n51·5° at 3 p.m. We did not halt here, but proceeded to Namgah, a very\r\nlong and fatiguing march. Thence a short march took us to Singtam,\r\nwhich we reached on the 30th of October. The road by which I had come\r\nup was for half the distance obliterated in most parts by\r\nlandslips,[302] but they were hard and dry, and the leeches were gone.\r\n\r\n [302] I took a number of dips and strikes of the micaceous rocks: the\r\n strike of these was as often north-east as north-west; it was ever\r\n varying, and the strata were so disturbed, as materially to increase\r\n the number and vast dimensions of the landslips.\r\n\r\n\r\nBad weather, and Campbell’s correspondence with the Durbar, who\r\nprevented all communication with the Rajah, detained us here two days,\r\nafter which we crossed to the Teesta valley, and continued along its\r\neast bank to Tucheam, 2000 feet above the river. We obtained a\r\nmagnificent view of the east face of Kinchinjunga, its tops bearing\r\nrespectively N. 62° W., and N. 63° W.: the south slope of the snowed\r\nportion in profile was 34°, and of the north 40°; but both appeared\r\nmuch steeper to the eye, when unaided by an instrument.\r\n\r\nThe great shrubby nettle (_Urtica crenulata_) is common here: this\r\nplant, called “Mealum-ma,” attains fifteen feet in height; it has broad\r\nglossy leaves, and though apparently without stings, is held in so\r\ngreat dread,[303] that I had difficulty in getting help to cut it down.\r\nI gathered many specimens without allowing any part to touch my skin;\r\nstill the scentless effluvium was so powerful, that mucous matter\r\npoured from my eyes and nose all the rest of the afternoon, in such\r\nabundance, that I had to hold my head over a basin for an hour. The\r\nsting is very virulent, producing inflammation; and to punish a child\r\nwith “Mealum-ma” is the severest Lepcha threat. Violent fevers and\r\ndeath have been said to ensue from its sting; but this I very much\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n [303] The stinging hairs are microscopic, and confined to the young\r\n shoots, leaf and flower-stalks. Leschenault de la Tour describes being\r\n stung by this nettle on three fingers of his hand only at the Calcutta\r\n Botanical Gardens, and the subsequent sneezing and running at the\r\n nose, followed by tetanic symptoms and two days’ suffering, nor did\r\n the effects disappear for nine days. It is a remarkable fact that the\r\n plant stings violently only at this season. I frequently gathered it\r\n with impunity on subsequent occasions, and suspected some inaccuracy\r\n in my observations; but in Silhet both Dr. Thomson and I experienced\r\n the same effects in autumn. Endlicher (“Lindley’s Vegetable Kingdom”)\r\n attributes the causticity of nettle-juice to bicarbonate of ammonia,\r\n which Dr. Thomson and I ascertained was certainly not present in this\r\n species.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibetan implements]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\n\r\nJourney to the Rajah’s residence at Tumloong—Ryott valley—Rajah’s\r\nhouse—Tupgain Lama—Lagong nunnery—Phadong Goompa—Phenzong ditto—Lepcha\r\nSepoys—Proceedings at Tumloong—Refused admittance to Rajah—Women’s\r\ndresses—Meepo’s and Tchebu Lama’s families—Chapel—Leave for Chola\r\npass—Ryott river—Rungpo, view from—Deputation of Kajees,\r\netc.—Conference—Laghep—Eatable fruit of\r\n_Decaisnia_—_Cathcartia_—Rhododendrons—Phieung- goong—Pines—Rutto\r\nriver—Barfonchen—Curling of rhododendron leaf—Woodcock—Chola pass—Small\r\nlakes—Tibet guard and sepoys—Dingpun—Arrival of Sikkim sepoys—Their\r\nconduct—Meet Singtam Soubah—Chumanako—We are seized by the Soubah’s\r\nparty—Soubah’s conduct—Dingpun Tinli—Treatment of Dr. Campbell—Bound\r\nand guarded—Separated from Campbell—Marched to Tumloong—Motives for\r\nsuch conduct—Arrive at Rungpo—At Phadong—Presents from Rajah—Visits of\r\nLama—Of Singtam Soubah—I am cross-questioned by Amlah—Confined with\r\nCampbell—Seizure of my Coolies—Threats of attacking Dorjiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe started on the 3rd of November for Tumloong (or Sikkim Durbar), Dr.\r\nCampbell sending Tchebu Lama forward with letters to announce his\r\napproach. A steep ascent, through large trees of _Rhododendron\r\narboreum,_ led over a sharp spur of mica-schist (strike north-west and\r\ndip north-east), beyond which the whole bay-like valley of the Ryott\r\nopened before us, presenting one of the most lovely and fertile\r\nlandscapes in Sikkim. It is ten miles long, and three or four broad,\r\nflanked by lofty mountains, and its head girt by the beautiful snowy\r\nrange of Chola, from which silvery rills descend through black\r\npine-woods, dividing innumerable converging cultivated spurs, and\r\nuniting about 2000 feet below us, in a profound gorge. Everywhere were\r\nscattered houses, purple crops of buckwheat, green fields of young\r\nwheat, yellow millet, broad green plantains, and orange groves.\r\n\r\nWe crossed spur after spur, often under or over precipices about\r\nfifteen hundred feet above the river, proceeding eastwards to the\r\nvillage of Rangang, whence we caught sight of the Rajah’s house. It was\r\nan irregular low stone building of Tibetan architecture, with slanting\r\nwalls and small windows high up under the broad thatched roof, above\r\nwhich, in the middle, was a Chinese-looking square copper-gilt canopy,\r\nwith projecting eaves and bells at the corners, surmounted by a ball\r\nand square spire. On either gable of the roof was a round-topped\r\ncylinder of gilded copper, something like a closed umbrella; this is a\r\nvery frequent and characteristic Boodhist ornament, and is represented\r\nin Turner’s plate of the mausoleum of Teshoo Lama (“Tibet” plate xi.);\r\nindeed the Rajah’s canopy at Tumloong is probably a copy of the upper\r\npart of the building there represented, having been built by architects\r\nfrom Teshoo Loombo. It was surrounded by chaits, mendongs, poles with\r\nbanners, and other religious erections; and though beautifully situated\r\non a flat terrace overlooking the valley, we were much disappointed\r\nwith its size and appearance.\r\n\r\nOn the brow of the hill behind was the large red goompa of the Tupgain\r\nLama, the late heir-apparent to the temporal and spiritual authority in\r\nSikkim; and near it a nunnery called Lagong, the lady abbess of which\r\nis a daughter of the Rajah, who, with the assistance of sisters, keeps\r\nan enormous Mani, or praying-cylinder, revolving perpetually to the\r\nprayer of “Om Mani Padmi hom.” On this side was a similar spur, on\r\nwhich the gilded pinnacles and copper canopy of the Phadong[304] goompa\r\ngleamed through the trees. At a considerable distance across the head\r\nof the valley was still a third goompa, that of Phenzong.\r\n\r\n [304] Phadong means Royal, and this temple answers to a chapel royal\r\n for the Rajah.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were met by a large party of armed Lepchas, dressed in blue and\r\nwhite striped kirtles, broad loose scarlet jackets; and the little\r\nbamboo wattle hat lined with talc, and surmounted by a peacock’s\r\nfeather; they escorted us to the village, and then retired.\r\n\r\nWe encamped a few hundred feet below the Rajah’s house, and close by\r\nthose of Meepo and the Tchebu Lama’s family, who are among the oldest\r\nand most respectable of Tibetan origin in Sikkim. The population on\r\nthis, the north side of the Ryott, consists principally of Sikkim\r\nBhoteeas and Tibetans, while the opposite is peopled by Lepchas. Crowds\r\ncame to see us, and many brought presents, with which we were\r\noverwhelmed; but we could not help remarking that our cordial greetings\r\nwere wholly from the older families attached to the Rajah, and from the\r\nLamas; none proceeded from the Dewan’s relatives or friends, nor\r\ntherefore any in the name of the Rajah himself, or of the Sikkim\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nTchebu Lama vainly used every endeavour to procure for us an audience\r\nwith his highness; who was surrounded by his councillors, or Amlah, all\r\nof whom were adherents of the Dewan, who was in Tibet. My man Meepo,\r\nand the Tchebu Lama; who were ordered to continue in official\r\nattendance upon us, shrugged their shoulders, but could suggest no\r\nremedy. On the following morning Campbell was visited by many parties,\r\namongst whom were the Lama’s family, and that of the late Dewan (Ilam\r\nSing), who implored us to send again to announce our presence, and not\r\nto dismiss at once the moonshie and his office,[305] who had\r\naccompanied us for the purpose of a conference with the Rajah. Their\r\nwishes were complied with, and we waited till noon before proceeding.\r\n\r\n [305] It is usual in India for Government officers when about to\r\n transact business, to travel with a staff (called office) of native\r\n interpreters, clerks, etc., of whom the chief is commonly called\r\n moonchie.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tchebu Lama]\r\n\r\nA gay and animated scene was produced by the concourse of women,\r\ndressed in their pretty striped and crossed cloaks, who brought tokens\r\nof good-will. Amongst them Meepo’s wife appeared conspicuous from the\r\nlarge necklaces[306] and amulets, corals, and silver filagree work,\r\nwith which her neck and shoulders were loaded: she wore on her head a\r\nred tiara (“Patuk”) bedizened with seed pearls and large turquoises,\r\nand a gold fillet of filagree bosses united by a web of slender chains;\r\nher long tails were elaborately plaited, and woven with beads, and her\r\ncloak hooked in front by a chain of broad silver links studded with\r\nturquoises. White silk scarfs, the emblem of peace and friendship, were\r\nthrown over our hands by each party; and rice, eggs, fowls, kids,\r\ngoats, and Murwa beer, poured in apace, to the great delight of our\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n [306] The lumps of amber forming these (called “Poshea”) were larger\r\n than the fist: they are procured in East Tibet, probably from Birmah.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe returned two visits of ceremony, one to Meepo’s house, a poor\r\ncottage, to which we carried presents of chintz dresses for his two\r\nlittle girls, who were busy teazing their hair with cylindrical combs,\r\nformed of a single slender joint of bamboo slit all round half-way up\r\ninto innumerable teeth. Our other visit was paid to the Lama’s family,\r\nwho inhabited a large house not far from the Rajah’s. The lower story\r\nwas an area enclosed by stone walls, into which the cattle, etc., were\r\ndriven. An outside stone stair led to the upper story, where we were\r\nreceived by the head of the family, accompanied by a great concourse of\r\nLamas. He conducted us to a beautiful little oratory at one end of the\r\nbuilding, fitted up like a square temple, and lighted with latticed\r\nwindows, covered with brilliant and tasteful paintings by Lhassan\r\nartists. The beams of the ceiling were supported by octagonal columns\r\npainted red, with broad capitals. Everywhere the lotus, the mani, and\r\nthe chirki (or wheel with three rays, emblematic of the Boodhist\r\nTrinity), were introduced; “Om Mani Padmi hom” in gilt letters, adorned\r\nthe projecting end of every beam;[307] and the Chinese “cloud\r\nmessenger,” or winged dragon, floated in azure and gold along the\r\ncapitals and beams, amongst scrolls and groups of flowers. At one end\r\nwas a sitting figure of Gorucknath in Lama robes, surrounded by a\r\nglory, with mitre and beads; the right hand holding the Dorje, and the\r\nforefinger raised in prayer. Around was a good library of books. More\r\npresents were brought here, and tea served.\r\n\r\n [307] A mythical animal with a dog’s head and blood-red spot over the\r\n forehead was not uncommon in this chapel, and is also seen in the\r\n Sikkim temples and throughout Tibet. Ermann, in his Siberian Travels,\r\n mentions it as occurring in the Khampa Lama’s temple at Maimao chin;\r\n he conjectures it to have been the Cyclops of the Greeks, which\r\n according to the Homeric myth had a mark on the forehead, instead of\r\n an eye. The glory surrounding the heads of Tibetan deities is also\r\n alluded to by Ermann, who recognises in it the Nimbus of the ancients,\r\n used to protect the heads of statues from the weather, and from being\r\n soiled by birds; and adds that the glory of the ancient masters in\r\n painting was no doubt introduced into the Byzantine school from the\r\n Boodhists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clasp of a woman’s cloak]\r\n\r\nThe route to Chola pass, which crosses the range of that name south of\r\nthe Chola peak (17,320 feet) at the head of this valley, is across the\r\nRyott, and then eastwards along a lofty ridge. Campbell started at\r\nnoon, and I waited behind with Meepo, who wished me to see the Rajah’s\r\ndwelling, to which we therefore ascended; but, to my guide’s chagrin,\r\nwe were met and turned back by a scribe, or clerk, of the Amlah. We\r\nwere followed by a messenger, apologising and begging me to return; but\r\nI had already descended 1000 feet, and felt no inclination to reascend\r\nthe hill, especially as there did not appear to be anything worth\r\nseeing. Soon after I had overtaken Campbell, he was accosted by an\r\nexcessively dirty fellow, who desired him to return for a conference\r\nwith the Amlah; this was of course declined, but, at the same time,\r\nCampbell expressed his readiness to receive the Amlah at our halting\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe Ryott flows in a very tropical gorge 2000 feet above the sea; from\r\nthe proximity of the snowy mountains, its temperature was only 64·3°.\r\nThence the ascent is very steep to Rungpo, where we took up our\r\nquarters at a rest house at an height of 6008 feet. This road is well\r\nkept, and hence onwards is traversed yearly by the Rajah on his way to\r\nhis summer residence of Choombi, two marches beyond the Cbola pass;\r\nwhither he is taken to avoid the Sikkim rains, which are peculiarly\r\ndisagreeable to Tibetans. Rungpo commands a most beautiful view\r\nnorthwards, across the valley, of the royal residence, temples,\r\ngoompas, hamlets, and cultivation, scattered over spurs that emerge\r\nfrom the forest, studded below with tree-ferns and plantains, and\r\nbacked by black pine-woods and snowy mountains. In the evening the\r\nAmlah arrived to confer with Campbell; at first there was a proposal of\r\nturning us out of the house, in which there was plenty of room besides,\r\nbut as we declined to move, except by his Highness’s order, they put up\r\nin houses close by.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they met us as we were departing for Chola\r\npass, bringing large presents in the name of the Rajah, and excuses on\r\ntheir and his part for having paid us no respect at Tumloong, saying,\r\nthat it was not the custom to receive strangers till after they had\r\nrested a day, that they were busy preparing a suitable reception, etc.;\r\nthis was all false, and contrary to etiquette, but there was no use in\r\ntelling them so. Campbell spoke firmly and kindly to them, and pointed\r\nout their incivility and the unfriendly tone of their whole conduct.\r\nThey then desired Campbell to wait and discuss business affairs with\r\nthem; this was out of the question, and he assured them that he was\r\never ready to do so with the Rajah, that he was now (as he had informed\r\nhis Highness) on his way with me to the Chola and Yakla passes, and\r\nthat we had, for want of coolies, left some loads behind us, which, if\r\nthey were really friendly, they would forward. This they did, and so we\r\nparted; they (contrary to expectation) making no objection to\r\nCampbell’s proceeding with me.\r\n\r\nA long march up a very steep, narrow ridge took us by a good road to\r\nLaghep, a stone resting-house (alt. 10,475 feet) on a very narrow flat.\r\nI had abundance of occupation in gathering rhododendron-seeds, of which\r\nI procured twenty-four kinds[308] on this and the following day.\r\n\r\n [308] These occurred in the following order in ascending, commencing\r\n at 6000 feet.—1. _R. Dalhousiæ_; 2. _R. vaccinioides_; 3. _R.\r\n camelliæflorwm_; 4. _R. arboreum._ Above 8000 feet:—5. _R. argenteum_;\r\n 6. _R. Falconeri_; 7. _R. barbatum_; 8. _R. Campbelliæ_; 9. _R.\r\n Edgeworthii_; 10. _R. niveum_; 11. _R. Thomsoni_; 12. _R.\r\n cinnabarinum_; 13. _R. glaucum._ Above 10,500 feet:—14. _R. lanatum_;\r\n 15. _R. virgatum_; 16. _R. campylocarpum_; 17. _R. ciliatum_; 18. _R.\r\n Hodgsoni_; 19. _R. campanulatum._ Above 12,000 feet:—20. _R.\r\n lepidotum_; 21. _R. fulgens_; 22. _R. Wightianum_; 23. _R.\r\n anthopogon_; 24. _R. setosum._\r\n\r\n\r\nA very remarkable plant, which I had seen in flower in the Lachen\r\nvalley, called “Loodoo-ma” by the Bhoteeas, and “Nomorchi” by Lepchas,\r\ngrew on the ridge at 7000 feet; it bears a yellow fruit like short\r\ncucumbers, full of a soft, sweet, milky pulp, and large black seeds; it\r\nbelongs to a new genus,[309] allied to _Stauntonia,_ of which two\r\nHimalayan kinds produce similar, but less agreeable edible fruits\r\n(“Kole-pot,” Lepcha). At Laghep, iris was abundant, and a small bushy\r\nberberry (_B. concinna_) with oval eatable berries. The north wall of\r\nthe house (which was in a very exposed spot) was quite bare, while the\r\nsouth was completely clothed with moss and weeds.\r\n\r\n [309] This genus, for which Dr. Thomson and I, in our “Flora Indies,”\r\n have proposed the name _Decaisnea_ (in honour of my friend Professor\r\n J. Decaisne, the eminent French botanist), has several straight,\r\n stick-like, erect branches from the root, which bear spreading\r\n pinnated leaves, two feet long, standing out horizontally. The flowers\r\n are uni-sexual, green, and in racemes, and the fruits, of which two or\r\n three grow together, are about four inches long, and one in diameter.\r\n All the other plants of the natural order to which it belongs, are\r\n climbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks above Laghep were gneiss; below it, mica-schist, striking\r\nnorth-west, and dipping north-east, at a high angle. A beautiful yellow\r\npoppy-like plant grew in clefts at 10,000 feet; it has flowered in\r\nEngland, from seeds which I sent home, and bears the name of\r\n_Cathcartia._[310]\r\n\r\n [310] See “Botanical Magazine,” for 1852. The name was given in honour\r\n of the memory of my friend, the late J. F. Cathcart, Esq., of the\r\n Bengal Civil Service. This gentleman was devoted to the pursuit of\r\n botany, and caused a magnificent series of drawings of Dorjiling\r\n plants to be made by native artists during his residence there. This\r\n collection is now deposited at Kew, through the liberality of his\r\n family, and it is proposed to publish a selection from the plates, as\r\n a tribute to his memory. Mr. Cathcart, after the expiration of his\r\n Indian service, returned to Europe, and died at Lausanne on his way to\r\n England.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe continued, on the following morning, in an easterly direction, up\r\nthe same narrow steep ridge, to a lofty eminence called Phieung-goong\r\n(alt. 12,422 feet), from being covered with the Phieung, or small\r\nbamboo. _Abies Webbiana_ begins here, and continues onwards, but, as on\r\nTonglo, Mainom, and the other outer wetter Sikkim ranges, there is\r\nneither larch, _Pinus excelsa, Abies Smithiana,_ or _A. Brunoniana._\r\n\r\nHence we followed an oblique descent of 1,500 feet, to the bed of the\r\nRutto river, through thick woods of pines and _Rhododendron Hodgsoni,_\r\nwhich latter, on our again ascending, was succeeded by the various\r\nalpine kinds. We halted at Barfonchen (alt. 11,233 feet), a stone-but\r\nin the silver-fir forest. Some yaks were grazing in the vicinity, and\r\nfrom their herdsman we learnt that the Dewan was at Choombi, on the\r\nroad to Yakla; he had kept wholly out of the way during the summer,\r\ndirecting every unfriendly action to be pursued towards myself and the\r\ngovernment by the Amlah, consisting of his brothers and relatives, whom\r\nhe left at Tumloong.\r\n\r\nThe night was brilliant and starlight: the minimum thermometer fell to\r\n27°, a strong north-east wind blew down the valley, and there was a\r\nthick hoar-frost, with which the black yaks were drolly powdered. The\r\nbroad leaves of _R. Hodgsoni_ were curled, from the expansion of the\r\nfrozen fluid in the layer of cells on the upper surface of the leaf,\r\nwhich is exposed to the greatest cold of radiation. The sun restores\r\nthem a little, but as winter advances, they become irrecoverably cured,\r\nand droop at the ends of the branches.\r\n\r\nWe left Barfonchen on the 7th November, and ascended the river, near\r\nwhich we put up a woodcock. Emerging from the woods at Chumanako (alt.\r\n12,590 feet), where there is another stone hut, the mountains become\r\nbleak, bare, and stony, and the rocks are all moutonnéed by ancient\r\nglaciers. At 13,000 feet the ground was covered with ice, and all the\r\nstreams were frozen. Crossing several rocky ledges, behind which were\r\nsmall lakes, a gradual ascent led to the summit of the Chola pass, a\r\nbroad low depression, 14,925 feet above the sea, wholly bare of snow.\r\n\r\nCampbell had preceded me, and I found him conversing with some\r\nTibetans, who told him that there was no road hence to Yakla, and that\r\nwe should not be permitted to go to Choombi. As the Chinese guard was\r\nposted in the neighbourhood, he accompanied one of the Tibetans to see\r\nthe commandant, whilst I remained taking observations. The temperature\r\nwas 33°, with a violent, biting, dry east wind. The rocks were gneiss,\r\nstriking north-east, and horizontal, or dipping north-west. The scanty\r\nvegetation consisted chiefly of grass and _Sibbaldia._\r\n\r\nIn about an hour Meepo and some of my people came up and asked for\r\nCampbell, for whom the Tchebu Lama was waiting below: the Lama had\r\nremained at Rungpo, endeavouring to put matters on a better footing\r\nwith the Amlah. Wishing to see the Tibet guard myself, I accompanied\r\nthe two remaining Tibetans down a steep valley with cliffs on either\r\nhand, for several hundred feet, when I was overtaken by some Sikkim\r\nsepoys in red jackets, who wanted to turn me back forcibly: I was at a\r\nloss to understand their conduct, and appealed to the Tibetan sepoys,\r\nwho caused them to desist. About 1000 feet down I found Campbell, with\r\na body of about ninety Tibetans, a few of whom were armed with\r\nmatchlocks, and the rest with bows and arrows. They were commanded by a\r\nDingpun, a short swarthy man, with a flat-crowned cap with floss-silk\r\nhanging all round, and a green glass button in front; he wore a loose\r\nscarlet jacket, broadly edged with black velvet, and having great brass\r\nbuttons of the Indian naval uniform; his subaltern was similarly\r\ndressed, but his buttons were those of the 44th Bengal Infantry. The\r\ncommandant having heard of our wish to go round by Choombi, told\r\nCampbell that he had come purposely to inform him that there was no\r\nroad that way to Yakla; he was very polite, ordering his party to rise\r\nand salute me when I arrived, and doing the same when we both left.\r\n\r\nOn our return we were accompanied by the Dingpun of the Tibetans and a\r\nfew of his people, and were soon met by more Sikkim sepoys, who said\r\nthey were sent from the Durbar, to bring Campbell back to transact\r\nbusiness; they behaved very rudely, and when still half a mile from the\r\nSikkim frontier, jostled him and feigned to draw their knives, and one\r\nof them pointed a spear-headed bow to his breast. Campbell defended\r\nhimself with a stick, and remonstrated with them on their rudeness; and\r\nI, who had nothing but a barometer in my hand, called up the Tibetans.\r\nThe Dingpun came instantly, and driving the Sikkim people forward,\r\nescorted us to the frontier, where he took an inscribed board from the\r\nchait, and showing us the great vermilion seal of the Emperor of China\r\n(or more probably of the Lhassan authorities) on one side, and two\r\nsmall brown ones of the Sikkim Rajah on the other; and giving us to\r\nunderstand that here his jurisdiction ceased, he again saluted and left\r\nus.\r\n\r\nOn descending, I was surprised to meet the Singtam Soubah, whom I had\r\nnot seen since leaving Tungu; he was seated on a rock, and I remarked\r\nthat he looked ashy pale and haggard, and that he salaamed to me only,\r\nand not to Campbell; and that Tchebu Lama, who was with him, seemed\r\nvery uncomfortable. The Soubah wanted Campbell to stop for a\r\nconference, which at such a time, and in such a wind, was impossible,\r\nso he followed us to Chumanako, where we proposed to pass the night.\r\n\r\nA great party of Sikkim Bhoteeas had assembled here, all strangers to\r\nme: I certainly thought the concourse unusually large, and the previous\r\nconduct to Campbell, strange, rude, and quite unintelligible,\r\nespecially before the Tibetans. But the Bhoteeas were always a queer,\r\nand often insolent people,[311] whom I was long ago tired of trying to\r\nunderstand, and they might have wanted to show off before their\r\nneighbours; and such was the confidence with which my long travels\r\namongst them had inspired me, that the possibility of danger or\r\nviolence never entered my head.\r\n\r\n [311] Captain Pemberton during his mission to Bhotan was repeatedly\r\n treated with the utmost insolence by the officials in that country\r\n (see Griffith’s Journal). My Sirdar, Nimbo, himself a native of\r\n Bhotan, saw a good deal of the embassy when there, and told me many\r\n particulars as to the treatment to which it had been subjected, and\r\n the consequent low estimation in which both the ambassadors themselves\r\n and the Government whom they represented were held in Bhotan.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went into the hut, and were resting ourselves on a log at one end of\r\nit, when, the evening being very cold, the people crowded in; on which\r\nCampbell went out, saying, that we had better leave the hut to them,\r\nand that he would see the tents pitched. He had scarcely left, when I\r\nheard him calling loudly to me, “Hooker! Hooker! the savages are\r\nmurdering me!” I rushed to the door, and caught sight of him striking\r\nout with his fists, and struggling violently; being tall and powerful,\r\nhe had already prostrated a few, but, a host of men bore him down, and\r\nappeared to be trampling on him; at the same moment I was myself seized\r\nby eight men, who forced me back into the hut, and down on the log,\r\nwhere they held me in a sitting posture, pressing me against the wall;\r\nhere I spent a few moments of agony, as I heard my friend’s stifled\r\ncries grow fainter and fainter. I struggled but little, and that only\r\nat first, for at least five-and-twenty men crowded round and laid their\r\nhands upon me, rendering any effort to move useless; they were,\r\nhowever, neither angry nor violent, and signed to me to keep quiet. I\r\nretained my presence of mind, and felt comfort in remembering that I\r\nsaw no knives used by the party who fell on Campbell, and that if their\r\nintentions had been murderous, an arrow would have been the more sure\r\nand less troublesome weapon. It was evident that the whole animus was\r\ndirected against Campbell, and though at first alarmed on my own\r\naccount, all the inferences which, with the rapidity of lightning my\r\nmind involuntarily drew, were favourable.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, three persons came into the hut, and seated\r\nthemselves opposite to me: I only recognised two of them; namely, the\r\nSingtam Soubah, pale, trembling like a leaf, and with great drops of\r\nsweat trickling from his greasy brow; and the Tchebu Lama, stolid, but\r\nevidently under restraint, and frightened. The former ordered the men\r\nto leave hold of me, and to stand guard on either side, and, in a\r\nviolently agitated manner, he endeavoured to explain that Campbell was\r\na prisoner by the orders of the Rajah, who was dissatisfied with his\r\nconduct as a government officer, during the past twelve years; and that\r\nhe was to be taken to the Durbar and confined till the supreme\r\ngovernment at Calcutta should confirm such articles as he should be\r\ncompelled to subscribe to; he also wanted to know from me how Campbell\r\nwould be likely to behave. I refused to answer any questions till I\r\nshould be informed why I was myself made prisoner; on which he went\r\naway, leaving me still guarded. My own Sirdar then explained that\r\nCampbell had been knocked down, tied hand and foot, and taken to his\r\ntent, and that all his coolies were also bound, our captors claiming\r\nthem as Sikkimites, and subjects of the Rajah.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the three returned, the Soubah looking more spectral\r\nthan ever, and still more violently agitated, and I thought I perceived\r\nthat whatever were his plans, he had failed in them. He asked me what\r\nview the Governor-General would take of this proceeding? and receiving\r\nno answer, he went off with the Tchebu Lama, and left me with the third\r\nindividual. The latter looked steadily at me for some time, and then\r\nasked if I did not know him. I said I did not, when he gave his name as\r\nDingpun Tinli, and I recognised in him one of the men whom the Dewan\r\nhad sent to conduct us to the top of Mainom the previous year (see vol.\r\ni. p. 305). This opened my eyes a good deal, for he was known to be a\r\nright-hand man of the Dewan’s, and had within a few months been\r\nconvicted of kidnapping two Brahmin girls from Nepal,[312] and had\r\nvowed vengeance against Campbell for the duty he performed in bringing\r\nhim to punishment.\r\n\r\n [312] This act as I have mentioned at v. i. p. 341, was not only a\r\n violation of the British treaty, but an outrage on the religion of\r\n Nepal. Jung Bahadoor demanded instant restitution, which Campbell\r\n effected; thus incurring the Dingpun’s wrath, who lost, besides his\r\n prize, a good deal of money which the escapade cost him.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was soon asked to go to my tent, which I found pitched close by; they\r\nrefused me permission to see my fellow-prisoner, or to be near him, but\r\nallowed me to hang up my instruments, and arrange my collections. My\r\nguards were frequently changed during the night, Lepchas often taking a\r\nturn; they repeatedly assured me that there was no complaint or\r\nill-feeling against me, that the better classes in Sikkim would be\r\ngreatly ashamed of the whole affair, that Tchebu Lama was equally a\r\nprisoner, and that the grievances against Campbell were of a political\r\nnature, but what they were they did not know.\r\n\r\nThe night was very cold (thermometer 26°), and two inches of snow fell.\r\nI took as many of my party as I could into my tent, they having no\r\nshelter fit for such an elevation (12,590 feet) at this season. Through\r\nthe connivance of some of the people, I managed to correspond with\r\nCampbell, who afterwards gave me the following account of the treatment\r\nhe had received. He stated that on leaving the hut, he had been met by\r\nMeepo, who told him the Soubah had ordered his being turned out. A\r\ncrowd of sepoys then fell on him and brought him to the ground, knocked\r\nhim on the head, trampled on him, and pressed his neck down to his\r\nchest as he lay, as if endeavouring to break it. His feet were tied,\r\nand his arms pinioned behind, the wrist of the right hand being bound\r\nto the left arm above the elbow; the cords were then doubled, and he\r\nwas violently shaken. The Singtam Soubah directed all this, which was\r\nperformed chiefly by the Dingpun Tinli and Jongpun Sangabadoo.[313]\r\nAfter this the Soubah came to me, as I have related; and returning, had\r\nCampbell brought bound before him, and asked him, through Tchebu Lama,\r\nif he would write from dictation. The Soubah was violent, excited, and\r\nnervous; Tchebu Lama scared. Campbell answered, that if they continued\r\ntorturing him (which was done by twisting the cords round his wrists by\r\na bamboo-wrench), he might say or do anything, but that his government\r\nwould not confirm any acts thus extorted. The Soubah became still more\r\nviolent, shook his bow in Campbell’s face, and drawing his hand\r\nsignificantly across his throat, repeated his questions, adding others,\r\nenquiring why he had refused to receive the Lassoo Kajee as Vakeel,\r\netc. (see p. 2).\r\n\r\n [313] This was the other man sent with us to Mainom, by the Dewan, in\r\n the previous December.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soubah’s people, meanwhile, gradually slunk away, seeing which he\r\nleft Campbell, who was taken to his tent.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning Meepo was sent by the Soubah, to ask whether I would\r\ngo to Yakla pass, or return to Dorjiling, and to say that the Rajah’s\r\norders had been very strict that I was not to be molested, and that I\r\nmight proceed to whatever passes I wished to visit, whilst Campbell was\r\nto be taken back to the Durbar, to transact business. I was obliged to\r\ncall upon the Soubah and Dingpun to explain their conduct of the\r\nprevious day, which they declared arose from no ill-feeling, but simply\r\nfrom their fear of my interfering in Campbell’s behalf; they could not\r\nsee what reason I had to complain, so long as I was neither hurt nor\r\nbound. I tried in vain to explain to them that they could not so play\r\nfast and loose with a British subject, and insisted that if they really\r\nconsidered me free, they should place me with Campbell, under whose\r\nprotection I considered myself, he being still the Governor-General’s\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion followed this: Meepo urged me to go on to Yakla, and\r\nleave these bad people; and the Soubah and Dingpun, who had exceeded\r\ntheir orders in laying hands on me, both wished me away. My course was,\r\nhowever, clear as to the propriety of keeping as close to Campbell as I\r\nwas allowed, so they reluctantly agreed to take me with him to the\r\nDurbar.\r\n\r\nTchebu Lama came to me soon afterwards, looking as stolid as ever, but\r\nwith a gulping in his throat; he alone was glad I was going with them,\r\nand implored me to counsel Campbell not to irritate the Amlah by a\r\nrefusal to accede to their dictates, in which case his life might be\r\nthe forfeit. As to himself, the opposite faction had now got the\r\nmastery, there was nothing for it but to succumb, and his throat would\r\nsurely be cut. I endeavoured to comfort him with the assurance that\r\nthey dared not hurt Campbell, and that this conduct of a party of\r\nruffians, influenced by the Dewan and their own private pique, did not\r\nrepresent his Rajah’s feelings and wishes, as he himself knew; but the\r\npoor fellow was utterly unnerved, and shaking hands warmly, with his\r\neyes full of tears, he took his leave.\r\n\r\nWe were summoned by the Dingpun to march at 10 a.m.: I demanded an\r\ninterview with Campbell first, which was refused; but I felt myself\r\npretty safe, and insisting upon it, he was brought to me. He was sadly\r\nbruised about the head, arms, and wrists, walked very lame, and had a\r\nblack eye to boot, but was looking stout and confident.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that seizing the representative of a neighbouring\r\npower and confining him till he shall have become amenable to terms, is\r\na common practice along the Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhotan frontiers. It had\r\nbeen resorted to in 1847, by the Bhotanese, under the instructions of\r\nthe Paro Pilo, who waylaid the Sikkim Rajah when still in Tibet, on his\r\nreturn from Jigatzi, and beleagured him for two months, endeavouring to\r\nbring him to their terms about some border dispute; on this occasion\r\nthe Rajah applied to the British government for assistance, which was\r\nrefused; and he was ultimately rescued by a Tibetan force.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the Dewan issued orders that Campbell was to be\r\nconfined at Tumloong till he himself should arrive there; and the Rajah\r\nwas kept in ignorance of the affair. The Sepoys who met us on our\r\napproach to Tumloong on the 3rd of November, were, I suspect,\r\noriginally sent for the purpose; and I think that the Amlah also had\r\nfollowed us to Rungpo with the same object. Their own extreme timidity,\r\nand the general good-feeling in the country towards Campbell prevented\r\nits execution before, and, as a last resource, they selected the\r\nSingtam Soubah and Dingpun Tinli for the office, as being personally\r\nhostile to him. The Dewan meanwhile being in Tibet, and knowing that we\r\nwere about to visit the frontier, for which I had full permission and\r\nescort, sent up the Tibetan guard, hoping to embroil them in the\r\naffair; in this he failed, and it drew upon him the anger of the\r\nLhassan authorities.[314] The Soubah, in endeavouring to extort the new\r\ntreaty by force, and the Dingpun, who had his own revenge to gratify,\r\nexceeded their instructions in using violence towards Campbell, whom\r\nthe Dewan ordered should be simply taken and confined; they were\r\nconsequently disgraced, long before we were released, and the failure\r\nof the stratagem thrown upon their shoulders.\r\n\r\n [314] In the following summer (1850), when the Rajah, Dewan, and\r\n Soubah, repaired to Choombi, the Lhassan authorities sent a\r\n Commissioner to inquire into the affair, understanding that the Dewan\r\n had attempted to embroil the Tibetans in it. The commissioner asked\r\n the Rajah why he had committed such an outrage on the representative\r\n of the British government, under whose protection he was; thus losing\r\n his territory, and bringing English troops so near the Tibet frontier.\r\n The Rajah answered that he never did anything of the kind; that he was\r\n old and infirm, and unable to transact all his affairs; that the\r\n mischief had arisen out of the acts and ignorance of others, and\r\n finally begged the Commissioner to investigate the whole affair, and\r\n satisfy himself about it. During the inquiry that followed, the Dewan\r\n threw all the blame on the Tibetans, who, he said were alone\r\n implicated: this assertion was easily disproved, and on the conclusion\r\n of the inquiry the Commissioner railed vehemently at the Dewan,\r\n saying:—“You tried to put this business on the people of my country;\r\n it is an abominable lie. You did it yourselves, and no one else. The\r\n Company is a great monarchy; you insulted it, and it has taken its\r\n revenge. If you, or any other Tibetan, ever again cause a rupture with\r\n the English, you shall be taken with ropes round your necks to Pekin,\r\n there to undergo the just punishment of your offence under the\r\n sentence of the mighty Emperor.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the march down to Laghep, Campbell was treated by the Dingpun’s\r\nmen with great rudeness: I kept as near as I was allowed, quietly\r\ngathering rhododendron seeds by the way. At the camping-ground we were\r\nagain separated, at which I remonstrated with the Dingpun, also\r\ncomplaining of his people’s insolent behaviour towards their prisoner,\r\nwhich he promised should be discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe next day we reached Rungpo, where we halted for further\r\ninstructions: our tents were placed apart, but we managed to correspond\r\nby stealth. On the 10th of November we were conducted to Tumloong: a\r\npony was brought for me, but I refused it, on seeing that Campbell was\r\ntreated with great indignity, and obliged to follow at the tail of the\r\nmule ridden by the Dingpun, who thus marched him in triumph up to the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nI was taken to a house at Phadong, and my fellow traveller was confined\r\nin another at some distance to the eastward, a stone’s throw below the\r\nRajah’s; and thrust into a little cage-like room. I was soon visited by\r\nan old Lama, who assured me that we were both perfectly safe, but that\r\nthere were many grievances against Campbell. The Soubah arrived shortly\r\nafter, bringing me compliments, nominally in the Rajah’s name, and a\r\nsubstantial present, consisting of a large cow, sheep, fowls, a brick\r\nof tea, bags of rice, flour, butter, eggs, and a profusion of\r\nvegetables. I refused to take them on the friendly terms on which they\r\nwere brought, and only accepted them as provisions during my detention.\r\nI remonstrated again about our separation, and warned the Soubah of the\r\ninevitable consequence of this outrage upon the representative of a\r\nfriendly power, travelling under the authority of his own government,\r\nunarmed and without escort: he was greatly perplexed, and assured me\r\nthat Campbell’s detention was only temporary, because he had not given\r\nsatisfaction to the Rajah, and as the latter could not get answers to\r\nhis demands from Calcutta in less than a month, it was determined to\r\nkeep him till then; but to send me to Dorjiling. He returned in the\r\nevening to tell me that Campbell’s men (with the exception only of the\r\nGhorkas[315]) had been seized, because they were runaway slaves from\r\nSikkim; but that I need not alarm myself, for mine should be untouched.\r\n\r\n [315] These people stood in far greater fear of the Nepalese than of\r\n the English, and the reason is obvious: the former allow no infraction\r\n of their rights to pass unnoticed, whereas we had permitted every\r\n article of our treaty to be contravened.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hut being small, and intolerably dirty, I pitched my tent close by,\r\nand lived in it for seven days: I was not guarded, but so closely\r\nwatched, that I could not go out for the most trifling purpose, except\r\nunder surveillance. They were evidently afraid of my escaping; I was\r\nhowever treated with civility, but forbidden to communicate either with\r\nCampbell or with Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nThe Soubah frequently visited me, always protesting I was no prisoner,\r\nthat Campbell’s seizure was a very trifling affair, and the violence\r\nemployed all a mistake. He always brought presents, and tried to sound\r\nme about the government at Calcutta. On the 12th he paid his last\r\nvisit, looking wofully dejected, being out of favour at court, and\r\ndismissed to his home: he referred me to Meepo for all future\r\ncommunications to the Rajah, and bade me a most cordial farewell, which\r\nI regretted being unable to return with any show of kind feeling. Poor\r\nfellow! he had staked his last, and lost it, when he undertook to seize\r\nthe agent of the most powerful government in the east, and to reduce\r\nhim to the condition of a tool of the Dewan. Despite the many\r\nobstructions he had placed in my way, we had not fallen out since July;\r\nwe had been constant companions, and though at issue, never at enmity.\r\nI had impeached him, and my grievances had been forwarded to the Rajah\r\nwith a demand for his punishment, but he never seemed to owe me a\r\ngrudge for that, knowing the Rajah’s impotence as compared with the\r\npower of the Dewan whom he served; and, in common with all his party,\r\npresuming on the unwillingness of the British government to punish.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of November I was hurriedly summoned by Meepo to the\r\nPhadong temple, where I was interrogated by the Amlah, as the Rajah’s\r\ncouncillors (in this instance the Dewan’s adherents) are called. I\r\nfound four China mats placed on a stone bench, on one of which I was\r\nrequested to seat myself, the others being occupied by the Dewan’s\r\nelder brother, a younger brother of the Gangtok Kajee (a man of some\r\nwealth), and an old Lama: the conference took place in the open air and\r\namongst an immense crowd of Lamas, men, women, and children.\r\n\r\nI took the initiative (as I made a point of doing on all such\r\noccasions) and demanded proper interpreters, which were refused; and\r\nthe Amlah began a rambling interrogatory in Tibetan, through my Lepcha\r\nSirdar Pakshok, who spoke very little Tibetan or Hindostanee, and my\r\nhalf-caste servant, who spoke as little English. The Dewan’s brother\r\nwas very nervously counting his beads, and never raised his eyes while\r\nI kept mine steadily upon him.\r\n\r\nHe suggested most of the queries, every one of which took several\r\nminutes, as he was constantly interrupted by the Kajee, who was very\r\nfat and stupid: the Lama scarcely spoke, and the bystanders never. My\r\nconnection with the Indian government was first enquired into; next\r\nthey came to political matters, upon which I declined entering; but I\r\ngathered that their object was to oblige Campbell to accept the Lassoo\r\nKajee as Vakeel, to alter the slavery laws, to draw a new boundary line\r\nwith Nepal, to institute direct communication between themselves and\r\nthe Governor-General,[316] and to engage that there should be no trade\r\nor communication between Sikkim and India, except through the Dewan:\r\nall of these subjects related to the terms of the original treaty\r\nbetween the Rajah and the Indian government. They told me they had sent\r\nthese proposals to the government through Dorjiling,[317] but had\r\nreceived no acknowledgment from the latter place, and they wanted to\r\nknow the probable result at Calcutta. As the only answer I could give\r\nmight irritate them, I again declined giving any. Lastly, they assured\r\nme that no blame was imputed to myself, that on the contrary I had been\r\ntravelling under the Rajah’s protection, who rejoiced in my success,\r\nthat I might have visited Yakla pass as I had intended doing, but that\r\npreferring to accompany my friend, they had allowed me to do so, and\r\nthat I might now either join him, or continue to live in my tent: of\r\ncourse I joyfully accepted the former proposal. After being refused\r\npermission to send a letter to Dorjiling, except I would write in a\r\ncharacter which they could read, I asked if they had anything more to\r\nsay, and being answered in the negative, I was taken by Meepo to\r\nCampbell, heartily glad to end a parley which had lasted for an hour\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\n [316] They were prompted to demand this by an unfortunate oversight\r\n that occurred at Calcutta some years before. Vakeels from the Sikkim\r\n Durbar repaired to that capital, and though unaccredited by the\r\n Governor-General’s agent at Dorjiling, were (in the absence of the\r\n Governor-General) received by the president of the council in open\r\n Durbar. The effect was of course to reduce the Governor-General’s\r\n agent at Dorjiling to a cipher.\r\n\r\n\r\n [317] These letters, which concluded with a line stating that Campbell\r\n was detained at Tumloong till favourable answers should be received,\r\n had arrived at Dorjiling; but being written in Tibetan, and containing\r\n matters into which no one but Campbell could enter, they were laid on\r\n one side till his return. The interpreter did not read the last line,\r\n which stated that Dr. Campbell was _detained_ till answers were\r\n received, and the fact of our capture and imprisonment therefore\r\n remained unknown for several weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found my friend in good health and spirits, strictly guarded in a\r\nsmall thatched hut, of bamboo wattle and clay: the situation was\r\npretty, and commanded a view of the Ryott valley and the snowy\r\nmountains; there were some picturesque chaits hard by, and a\r\nblacksmith’s forge. Our walks were confined to a few steps in front of\r\nthe hut, and included a puddle and a spring of water. We had one black\r\nroom with a small window, and a fire in the middle on a stone; we slept\r\nin the narrow apartment behind it, which was the cage in which Campbell\r\nhad been at first confined, and which exactly admitted us both, lying\r\non the floor. Two or three Sepoys occupied an adjoining room, and had a\r\npeep-hole through the partition-wall.\r\n\r\nMy gratification at our being placed together was damped by the seizure\r\nof all my faithful attendants except my own servant, and one who was a\r\nNepalese: the rest were bound, and placed in the stocks and close\r\nconfinement, charged with being Sikkim people who had no authority to\r\ntake service in Dorjiling. On the contrary they were all registered as\r\nBritish subjects, and had during my travels been recognised as such by\r\nthe Rajah and all his authorities. Three times the Soubah and others\r\nhad voluntarily assured me that my person and people were inviolate;\r\nnor was there any cause for this outrage but the fear of their escaping\r\nwith news to Dorjiling, and possibly a feeling of irritation amongst\r\nthe authorities at the failure of their schemes. Meanwhile we were not\r\nallowed to write, and we heard that the bag of letters which we had\r\nsent before our capture had been seized and burnt. Campbell greatly\r\nfeared that they would threaten Dorjiling with a night attack,[318] as\r\nwe heard that the Lassoo Kajee was stationed at Namtchi with a party\r\nfor that purpose, and all communication cut off, except through him.\r\n\r\n [318] Threats of sacking Dorjiling had on several previous occasions\r\n been made by the Dewan, to the too great alarm of the inhabitants, who\r\n were ignorant of the timid and pacific disposition of the Lepchas, and\r\n of the fact that there are not fifty muskets in the country, nor\r\n twenty men able to use them. On this occasion the threats were coupled\r\n with the report that we were murdered, and that the Rajah had asked\r\n for 50,000 Tibetan soldiers, who were being marched twenty-five days’\r\n journey over passes 16,000 feet high, and deep in snow, and were\r\n coming to drive the English out of Sikkim! I need hardly observe that\r\n the Tibetans (who have repeatedly refused to interfere on this side\r\n the snows) had no hand in the matter, or that, supposing they could\r\n collect that number of men in all Tibet, it would be impossible to\r\n feed them for a week, there or in Sikkim. Such reports unfortunately\r\n spread a panic in Dorjiling: the guards were called in from all the\r\n outposts, and the ladies huddled into one house, whilst the males\r\n stood on the defensive; to the great amusement of the Amlah at\r\n Tumloong, whose insolence to us increased proportionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Horns of the Showa stag (Cervus Wallichii), a native of\r\nChoombi in Tibet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell is ordered to appear at Durbar—Lamas called to\r\ncouncil—Threats—Searcity of food—Arrival of Dewan—Our jailer,\r\nThoba-sing—Temperature, etc., at Tumloong—Services of Goompas—Lepcha\r\ngirl—Jew’s-harp—Terror of servants—Ilam-sing’s family—Interview with\r\nDewan—Remonstrances—Dewan feigns sickness—Lord Dalhousie’s letter to\r\nRajah—Treatment of Indo-Chinese—Concourse of Lamas—Visit of Tchebu\r\nLama—Close confinement—Dr. Campbell’s illness—Conference with\r\nAmlah—Relaxation of confinement—Pemiongchi Lama’s intercession—Escape\r\nof Nimbo—Presents from Rajah, Ranee and people—Protestations of\r\nfriendship—Mr. Lushington sent to Dorjiling—Leave Tumloong—Cordial\r\nfarewell—Dewan’s merchandise—Gangtok Kajee—Dewan’s\r\npomp—Governor-General’s letter—Dikkeeling—Suspicion of poison—Dinner\r\nand pills—Tobacco—Bhotanese colony—Katong-ghat on Teesta—Wild\r\nlemons—Sepoys’ insolence—Dewan alarmed—View of Dorjiling—Threats of a\r\nrescue—Fears of our escape—Tibet flutes—Negotiate our release—Arrival\r\nat Dorjiling—Dr. Thomson joins me—Movement of troops at\r\nDorjiling—Seizure of Rajah’s Terai property.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince his confinement, Dr. Campbell had been desired to attend the\r\nDurbar for the purpose of transacting business, but had refused to go,\r\nexcept by compulsion, considering that in the excited state of the\r\nauthorities, amongst whom there was not one person of responsibility or\r\njudgment, his presence would not only be useless, but he might be\r\nexposed to further insult or possibly violence.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of November we were informed that the Dewan was on his way\r\nfrom Tibet: of this we were glad, for knave as he was, we had hitherto\r\nconsidered him to possess sense and understanding. His agents were\r\nbeginning to find out their mistake, and summoned to council the\r\nprincipal Lamas and Kajees of the country, who, to a man, repudiated\r\nthe proceedings, and refused to attend. Our captors were extremely\r\nanxious to induce us to write letters to Dorjiling, and sent spies of\r\nall kinds to offer us facilities for secret correspondence. The\r\nsimplicity and clumsiness with which these artifices were attempted\r\nwould have been ludicrous under other circumstances; while the threat\r\nof murdering Campbell only alarmed us, inasmuch as it came from people\r\ntoo stupid to be trusted. We made out that all Sikkim people were\r\nexcluded from Dorjiling, and the Amlah consequently could not conceal\r\ntheir anxiety to know what had befallen their letters to government.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we were but scantily fed, and our imprisoned coolies got\r\nnothing at all. Our guards, were supplied with a handful of rice or\r\nmeal as the day’s allowance; they were consequently grumbling,[319] and\r\nwere daily reduced in number. The supplies of rice from the Terai,\r\nbeyond Dorjiling, were cut off by the interruption of communication,\r\nand the authorities evidently could not hold us long at this rate: we\r\nsent up complaints, but of course received no answer.\r\n\r\n [319] The Rajah has no standing army; not even a body-guard, and these\r\n men were summoned to Tumloong before our arrival: they had no arms and\r\n received no pay, but were fed when called out on duty. There is no\r\n store for grain, no bazaar or market, in any part of the country, each\r\n family growing little enough for its own wants and no more;\r\n consequently Sikkim could not stand on the defensive for a week. The\r\n Rajah receives his supply of grain in annual contributions from the\r\n peasantry, who thus pay a rent in kind, which varies from little to\r\n nothing, according to the year, etc. He had also property of his own\r\n in the Terai, but the slender proceeds only enabled him to trade with\r\n Tibet for tea, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dewan arrived in the afternoon in great state; carried in an\r\nEnglish chair given him by Campbell some years before, habited in a\r\nblue silk cloak lined with lambskin, and wearing an enormous straw hat\r\nwith a red tassel, and black velvet butterflies on the flapping brim.\r\nHe was accompanied by a household of women, who were laden with\r\nornaments, and wore boots, and sat astride on ponies; many Lamas were\r\nalso with him, one of whom wore a broad Chinese-like hat covered with\r\npolished copper foil. Half a dozen Sepoys with matchlocks preceded him,\r\nand on approaching Tumloong, bawled out his titles, dignities, etc., as\r\nwas formerly the custom in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rajah’s residence, and the hut assigned to us. Arrival\r\nof the Dewan.]\r\n\r\nAt Dorjiling our seizure was still unknown: our letters were brought to\r\nus, but we were not allowed to answer them. Now that the Dewan had\r\narrived, we hoped to come to a speedy explanation with him, but he\r\nshammed sickness, and sent no answer to our messages; if indeed he\r\nreceived them. Our guards were reduced to one Sepoy with a knife, who\r\nwas friendly; and a dirty, cross-eyed fellow named Thoba-sing, who,\r\nwith the exception of Tchebu Lama, was the only Bhoteea about the\r\nDurbar who could speak Hindostanee, and who did it very imperfectly: he\r\nwas our attendant and spy, the most barefaced liar I ever met with,\r\neven in the east; and as cringing and obsequious when alone with us, as\r\nhe was to his masters on other occasions, when he never failed to show\r\noff his authority over us in an offensive manner. Though he was the\r\nmost disagreeable fellow we were ever thrown in contact with, I do not\r\nthink that he was therefore selected, but solely from his possessing a\r\nfew words of Hindostanee, and his presumed capability of playing the\r\nspy.\r\n\r\nThe weather was generally drizzling or rainy, and we were getting very\r\ntired of our captivity; but I beguiled the time by carefully keeping my\r\nmeteorological register,[320] and by reducing many of my previous\r\nobservations. Each morning we were awakened at daybreak by the\r\nprolonged echos of the conchs, trumpets, and cymbals, beaten by the\r\npriests before the many temples in the valley: wild and pleasing\r\nsounds, often followed by their choral chants. After dark we sat over\r\nthe fire, generally in company with a little Lepcha girl, who was\r\nappointed to keep us in fire-wood, and who sat watching our movements\r\nwith childish curiosity. Dolly, as we christened her, was a quick child\r\nand a kind one, intolerably dirty, but very entertaining from her\r\npowers of mimicry. She was fond of hearing me whistle airs, and\r\nprocured me a Tibetan Jews’-harp,[321] with which, and coarse tobacco,\r\nwhich I smoked out of a Tibetan brass pipe, I wiled away the dark\r\nevenings, whilst my cheerful companion amused himself with an old\r\nharmonicon, to the enchantment of Dolly and our guards and neighbours.\r\n\r\n [320] During the thirty days spent at Tumloong, the temperature was\r\n mild and equable, with much cloud and drizzle, but little hard rain;\r\n and we experienced violent thunder-storms, followed by transient\r\n sunshine. Unlike 1848, the rains did not cease this year before the\r\n middle of December; nor had there been one fine month since April. The\r\n mean temperature, computed from 150 observations, was 50·2°, and from\r\n the maximum and minimum thermometer 49·6°, which is a fair\r\n approximation to the theoretical temperature calculated for the\r\n elevation and month, and allows a fall of 1° for 320 feet of ascent.\r\n The temperature during the spring (from 50 observations) varied during\r\n the day from 2·4° to 5·8° higher than that of the air, the greatest\r\n differences occurring morning and evening. The barometric tide\r\n amounted to 0·091 between 9.50 a.m. and 4 p.m., which is less than at\r\n the level of the plains of India, and more than at any greater\r\n elevation than Tumloong. The air was always damp, nearly saturated at\r\n night, and the mean amount of humidity for ninety-eight observations\r\n taken during the day was only 0·850, corresponding to a dew-point of\r\n 49·6°, or 5·2° below that of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n [321] This instrument (which is common in Tibet) is identical with the\r\n European, except that the tongue is produced behind the bow, in a\r\n strong steel spike, by which the instrument is held firmer to the\r\n mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tibet pipe, and tinder-pouch with steel, attached.]\r\n\r\nThe messengers from Dorjiling were kept in utter ignorance of our\r\nconfinement till their arrival at Tumloong, when they were\r\ncross-questioned, and finally sent to us. They gradually became too\r\nnumerous, there being only one apartment for ourselves, and such of our\r\nservants as were not imprisoned elsewhere. Some of them were frightened\r\nout of their senses, and the state of abject fear and trembling in\r\nwhich one Limboo arrived, and continued for nearly a week, was quite\r\ndistressing[322] to every one except Dolly, who mimicked him in a\r\nmanner that was irresistibly ludicrous. Whether he had been beaten or\r\nthreatened we could not make out, nor whether he had heard of some dark\r\nfate impending over ourselves—a suspicion which would force itself on\r\nour minds; especially as Thoba-sing had coolly suggested to the Amlah\r\nthe dispatching of Campbell, as the shortest way of getting out of the\r\nscrape! We were also ignorant whether any steps were being taken at\r\nDorjiling for our release, which we felt satisfied must follow any\r\nactive measures against these bullying cowards, though they themselves\r\nfrequently warned us that we should be thrown into the Teesta if any\r\nsuch were pursued.\r\n\r\n [322] It amounted to a complete prostration of bodily and mental\r\n powers: the man trembled and started when spoken to, or at any noise,\r\n a cold sweat constantly bedewed his forehead, and he continued in this\r\n state for eight days. No kindness on Campbell’s part could rouse him\r\n to give any intelligible account of his fears or their cause. His\r\n companions said he had lost his goroo, _i.e.,_ his charm, which the\r\n priest gives him while yet a child, and which he renews or gets\r\n re-sanctified as occasion requires. To us the circumstance was\r\n extremely painful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as our money lasted, we bought food, for the Durbar had none to\r\ngive; and latterly my ever charitable companion fed our guards,\r\nincluding Dolly and Thoba-sing, in pity to their pinched condition.\r\nSeveral families sent us small presents, especially that of the late\r\nestimable Dewan, Ilam-sing, whose widow and daughters lived close by,\r\nand never failed to express in secret their sympathy and good feeling.\r\n\r\nTchebu Lama’s and Meepo’s families were equally forward in their desire\r\nto serve us; but they were marked men, and could only communicate by\r\nstealth.\r\n\r\nOur coolies were released on the 18th, more than half starved, but the\r\nSirdars were still kept in chains or the stocks: some were sent back to\r\nDorjiling, and the British subjects billetted off amongst the\r\nvillagers, and variously employed by the Dewan: my lad, Cheytoong, was\r\nset to collect the long leaves of a _Tupistra,_ called “Purphiok,”\r\nwhich yield a sweet juice, and were chopped up and mixed with tobacco\r\nfor the Dewan’s hookah.\r\n\r\n_November 20th._—The Dewan, we heard this day, ignored all the late\r\nproceedings, professing to be enraged with his brother and the Amlah,\r\nand refusing to meddle in the matter. This was no doubt a pretence: we\r\nhad sent repeatedly for an explanation with himself or the Rajah, from\r\nwhich he excused himself on the plea of ill-health, till this day, when\r\nhe apprized us that he would meet Campbell, and a cotton tent was\r\npitched for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWe went about noon, and were received with great politeness and shaking\r\nof hands by the Dewan, the young Gangtok Kajee, and the old monk who\r\nhad been present at my examination at Phadong. Tchebu Lama’s brother\r\nwas also there, as a member of the Amlah, lately taken into favour;\r\nwhile Tchebu himself acted as interpreter, the Dewan speaking only\r\nTibetan. They all sat cross-legged on a bamboo bench on one side, and\r\nwe on chairs opposite them: walnuts and sweetmeats were brought us, and\r\na small present in the Rajah’s name, consisting of rice, flour, and\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan opened the conversation both in this and another conference,\r\nwhich took place on the 22nd, by requesting Campbell to state his\r\nreasons for having desired these interviews. Neither he nor the Amlah\r\nseemed to have the smallest idea of the nature and consequences of the\r\nacts they had committed, and they therefore anxiously sought\r\ninformation as to the view that would be taken of them by the British\r\nGovernment. They could not see why Campbell should not transact\r\nbusiness with them in his present condition, and wanted him to be the\r\nmedium of communication between themselves and Calcutta. The latter\r\nconfined himself to pointing out his own views of the following\r\nsubjects:—1. The seizing and imprisoning of the agent of a friendly\r\npower, travelling unarmed and without escort, under the formal\r\nprotection of the Rajah, and with the authority of his own government.\r\n2. The aggravation of this act of the Amlah, by our present detention\r\nunder the Dewan’s authority. 3. The chance of collision, and the\r\ndisastrous consequences of a war, for which they had no preparation of\r\nany kind. 4. The impossibility of the supreme government paying any\r\nattention to their letters so long as we were illegally detained.\r\n\r\nAll this sank deep into the Dewan’s heart: he answered, “You have\r\nspoken truth, and I will submit it all to the Rajah;” but at the same\r\ntime he urged that there was nothing dishonourable in the imprisonment,\r\nand that the original violence being all a mistake, it should be\r\noverlooked by both parties. We parted on good terms, and heard shortly\r\nafter the second conference that our release was promised and arranged:\r\nwhen a communication[323] from Dorjiling changed their plans, the Dewan\r\nconveniently fell sick on the spot, and we were thrown back again.\r\n\r\n [323] I need scarcely say that every step was taken at Dorjiling for\r\n our release, that the most anxious solicitude for our safety could\r\n suggest. But the first communication to the Rajah, though it pointed\r\n out the heinous nature of his offence, was, through a natural fear of\r\n exasperating our captors, couched in very moderate language. The\r\n particulars of our seizure, and the reasons for it, and for our\r\n further detention, were unknown at Dorjiling, or a very different line\r\n of policy would have been pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, we were allowed to write to our friends, and\r\nto receive money and food, of which we stood in great need. I\r\ntransmitted a private account of the whole affair to the\r\nGovernor-General, who was unfortunately at Bombay, but to whose prompt\r\nand vigorous measures we were finally indebted for our release. His\r\nlordship expedited a despatch to the Rajah, such as the latter was\r\naccustomed to receive from Nepal, Bhotan, or Lhassa, and such as alone\r\ncommands attention from these half-civilized Indo-Chinese, who measure\r\npower by the firmness of the tone adopted towards them; and who,\r\nwhether in Sikkim, Birmah, Siam, Bhotan, or China, have too long been\r\naccustomed to see every article of our treaties contravened, with no\r\nworse consequences than a protest or a threat, which is never carried\r\ninto execution till some fatal step calls forth the dormant power of\r\nthe British Government.[324]\r\n\r\n [324] We forget that all our concessions to these people are\r\n interpreted into weakness; that they who cannot live on an amicable\r\n equality with one another, cannot be expected to do so with us; that\r\n all our talk of power and resources are mere boasts to habitual\r\n bullies, so long as we do not exert ourselves in the correction of\r\n premeditated insults. No Government can be more tolerant, more\r\n sincerely desirous of peace, and more anxious to confine its sway\r\n within its own limits than that of India, but it can only continue at\r\n peace by demanding respect, and the punctilious enforcement of even\r\n the most trifling terms in the treaties it makes with Indo-Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of the month arrived without bringing any prospect of our\r\nrelease, whilst we were harassed by false reports of all kinds. The\r\nDewan went on the 25th to a hot bath, a few hundred feet down the hill;\r\nhe was led past our hut, his burly frame tottering as if in great\r\nweakness, but a more transparent fraud could not have been practised:\r\nhe was, in fact, lying on his oars, pending further negotiations. The\r\nAmlah proposed that Campbell should sign a bond, granting immunity for\r\nall past offences on their part, whilst they were to withdraw the\r\nletter of grievances against him. The Lamas cast horoscopes for the\r\nfuture, little presents continually arrived for us, and the Ranee sent\r\nme some tobacco, and to Campbell brown sugar and Murwa beer. The\r\nblacksmiths, who had been ostentatiously making long knives at the\r\nforge hard by, were dismissed; troops were said to be arriving at\r\nDorjiling, and a letter sternly demanding our release bad been\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas of Pemiongchi, Changachelling, Tassiding, etc., and the\r\nDewan’s enemies, and Tchebu Lama’s friends, began to flock from all\r\nquarters to Tumloong, demanding audience of the Rajah, and our instant\r\nliberation. The Dewan’s game was evidently up; but the timidity of his\r\nopponents, his own craft, and the habitual dilatoriness of all,\r\ncontributed to cause endless delays. The young Gangtok Kajee tried to\r\ncurry favour with us, sending word that he was urging our release, and\r\nadding that he had some capital ponies for us to see on our way to\r\nDorjiling! Many similar trifles showed that these people had not a\r\nconception of the nature of their position, or of that of an officer of\r\nthe British Government.\r\n\r\nThe Tchebu Lama visited us only once, and then under surveillance; he\r\nrenewed his professions of good faith, and we had every reason to know\r\nthat he had suffered severely for his adherence to us, and consistent\r\nrepudiation of the Amlah’s conduct; he was in great favour with his\r\nbrother Lamas, but was not allowed to see the Rajah, who was said to\r\ntrust to him alone of all his counsellors. He told us that peremptory\r\norders had arrived from Calcutta for our release, but that the Amlah\r\nhad replied that they would not acknowledge the despatch, from its not\r\nbearing the Governor-General’s great seal! The country-people refusing\r\nto be saddled with the keep of our coolies, they were sent to Dorjiling\r\nin small parties, charged to say that we were free, and following them.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued rainy and bad, with occasionally a few hours of\r\nsunshine, which, however, always rendered the ditch before our door\r\noffensive: we were still prevented leaving the hot, but as a great\r\nannual festival was going on, we were less disagreeably watched.\r\nCampbell was very unwell, and we had no medicine; and as the Dewan,\r\naccustomed to such duplicity himself, naturally took this for a _ruse,_\r\nand refused to allow us to send to Dorjiling for any, we were more than\r\never convinced that his own sickness was simulated.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd and 3rd December we had further conferences with the Dewan,\r\nwho said that we were to be taken to Dorjiling in six days, with two\r\nVakeels from the Rajah. The Pemiongchi Lama, as the oldest and most\r\nvenerated in Sikkim, attended, and addressed Campbell in a speech of\r\ngreat feeling and truth. Having heard, he said, of these unfortunate\r\ncircumstances a few days ago, he had come on feeble limbs, and though\r\nupwards of seventy winters old, as the representative of his holy\r\nbrotherhood, to tender advice to his Rajah, which he hoped would be\r\nfollowed: Since Sikkim had been connected with the British rule, it had\r\nexperienced continued peace and protection; whereas before they were in\r\nconstant dread of their lives and properties, which, as well as their\r\nmost sacred temples, were violated by the Nepalese and Bhotanese. He\r\nthen dwelt upon Campbell’s invariable kindness and good feeling, and\r\nhis exertions for the benefit of their country, and for the cementing\r\nof friendship, and hoped he would not let these untoward events induce\r\nan opposite course in future but that he would continue to exert his\r\ninfluence with the Governor-General in their favour.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan listened attentively; he was anxious and perplexed, and\r\nevidently losing his presence of mind: he talked to us of Lhassa and\r\nits gaieties, dromedaries, Lamas, and everything Tibetan; offered to\r\nsell us ponies cheap, and altogether behaved in a most, undignified\r\nmanner; ever and anon calling attention to his pretended sick leg,\r\nwhich he nursed on his knee. He gave us the acceptable news that the\r\ngovernment at Calcutta had sent up an officer to carry on Campbell’s\r\nduties, which had alarmed him exceedingly. The Rajah, we were told, was\r\nvery angry at our seizure and detention; he had no fault to find with\r\nthe Governor-General’s agent, and hoped he would be continued as such.\r\nIn fact, all the blame was thrown on the brothers of the Dewan, and of\r\nthe Gangtok Kajee, and more irresponsible stupid boors could not have\r\nbeen found on whom to lay it, or who would have felt less inclined to\r\ncommit such folly if it had not been put on them by the Dewan. On\r\nleaving, white silk scarfs were thrown over our shoulders, and we went\r\naway, still doubtful, after so many disappointments, whether we should\r\nreally be set at liberty at the stated period.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was so much talk about our leaving, our confinement\r\ncontinued as rigorous as ever. The Dewan curried favour in every other\r\nway, sending us Tibetan wares for purchase, with absurd prices\r\nattached, he being an arrant pedlar. All the principal families waited\r\non us, desiring peace and friendship. The coolies who had not been\r\ndismissed were allowed to run away, except my Bhotan Sirdar, Nimbo,\r\nagainst whom the Dewan was inveterate;[325] he, however, managed soon\r\nafterwards to break a great chain with which his legs were shackled,\r\nand marching at night, eluded a hot pursuit, and proceeded to the\r\nTeesta, swam the river, and reached Dorjiling in eight days; arriving\r\nwith a large iron ring on each leg, and a link of several pounds weight\r\nattached to one.\r\n\r\n [325] The Sikkim people are always at issue with the Bhotanese. Nimbo\r\n was a runaway slave of the latter country, who had been received into\r\n Sikkim, and retained there until he took up his quarters at Dorjiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nParting presents arrived from the Rajah on the 7th, consisting of\r\nponies, cloths, silks, woollens, immense squares of butter, tea, and\r\nthe usual et ceteras, to the utter impoverishment of his stores: these\r\nhe offered to the two Sahibs, “in token of his amity with the British\r\ngovernment, his desire for peace, and deprecation of angry\r\ndiscussions.” The Ranee sent silk purses, fans, and such Tibetan\r\nparaphernalia, with an equally amicable message, that “she was most\r\nanxious to avert the consequences of whatever complaints had gone forth\r\nagainst Dr. Campbell, who might depend on her strenuous exertions to\r\npersuade the Rajah to do whatever he wished!” These friendly messages\r\nwere probably evoked by the information that an English regiment, with\r\nthree guns, was on its way to Sikkim, and that 300 of the Bhaugulpore\r\nRangers had already arrived there. The government of Bengal sending\r\nanother agent[326] to Dorjiling, was also a contingency they had not\r\nanticipated, having fully expected to get rid of any such obstacle to\r\ndirect communication with the Governor-General.\r\n\r\n [326] Mr. Lushington, the gentleman sent to conduct Sikkim affairs\r\n during Dr. Campbell’s detention: to whom I shall ever feel grateful\r\n for his activity in our cause, and his unremitting attention to every\r\n little arrangement that could alleviate the discomforts and anxieties\r\n of our position.\r\n\r\n\r\nA present from the whole population followed that of the Ranee, coupled\r\nwith earnest entreaties that Campbell would resume his position at\r\nDorjiling; and on the following day forty coolies mustered to arrange\r\nthe baggage. Before we left, the Ranee sent three rupees to buy a yard\r\nof chalé and some gloves, accompanying them with a present of white\r\nsilk, etc., for Mrs. Campbell, to whom the commission was intrusted: a\r\nsingular instance of the _insouciant_ simplicity of these odd people.\r\n\r\nThe 9th of December was a splendid and hot day, one of the very few we\r\nhad had during our captivity. We left at noon, descending the hill\r\nthrough an enormous crowd of people, who brought farewell presents, all\r\nwishing us well. We were still under escort as prisoners of the Dewan,\r\nwho was coolly marching a troop of forty unloaded mules and ponies, and\r\ndouble that number of men’s loads of merchandize, purchased during the\r\nsummer in Tibet, to trade with at Dorjiling and the Titalya fair! His\r\nimpudence or stupidity was thus quite inexplicable; treating us as\r\nprisoners, ignoring every demand of the authorities at Dorjiling, of\r\nthe Supreme Council of Calcutta, and of the Governor-General himself;\r\nand at the same time acting as if he were to enter the British\r\nterritories on the most friendly and advantageous footing for himself\r\nand his property, and incurring so great an expense in all this as to\r\nprove that he was in earnest in thinking so.\r\n\r\nTchebu Lama accompanied us, but we were not allowed to converse with\r\nhim. We halted at the bottom of the valley, where the Dewan invited us\r\nto partake of tea; from this place he gave us mules[327] or ponies to\r\nride, and we ascended to Yankoong, a village 3,867 feet above the sea.\r\nOn the following day we crossed a high ridge from the Ryott valley to\r\nthat of the Rungmi; where we camped at Tikbotang (alt. 3,763 feet),\r\nand, on the 11th at Gangtok Sampoo, a few miles lower down the same\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n [327] The Tibet mules are often as fine as the Spanish: I rode one\r\n which had performed a journey from Choombi to Lhassa in fifteen days,\r\n with a man and load.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were now in the Soubahship of the Gangtok Kajee; a member of the\r\noldest and most wealthy family in Sikkim; he had from the first\r\nrepudiated the late acts of the Amlah, in which his brother had taken\r\npart, and had always been hostile to the Dewan. The latter conducted\r\nhimself with disagreeable familiarity towards us, and _hauteur_ towards\r\nthe people; he was preceded by immense kettle-drums, carried on men’s\r\nbacks, and great hand-bells, which were beaten and rung on approaching\r\nvillages; on which occasions he changed his dress of sky-blue for\r\nyellow silk robes worked with Chinese dragons, to the indignation of\r\nTchebu Lama, an amber robe in polite Tibetan society being sacred to\r\nroyalty and the Lamas. We everywhere perceived unequivocal symptoms of\r\nthe dislike with which he was regarded. Cattle were driven away,\r\nvillages deserted, and no one came to pay respects, or bring presents,\r\nexcept the Kajees, who were ordered to attend, and his elder brother,\r\nfor whom he had usurped an estate near Gangtok.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, he marched us a few miles, and then halted for a day at\r\nSerriomsa (alt. 2,820 feet), at the bottom of a hot valley full of\r\nirrigated rice-crops and plantain and orange-groves. Here the Gangtok\r\nKajee waited on us with a handsome present, and informed us privately\r\nof his cordial hatred of the “upstart Dewan,” and hopes for his\r\noverthrow; a demonstration of which we took no notice.[328] The Dewan’s\r\nbrother (one of the Amlah) also sent a large present, but was ashamed\r\nto appear. Another letter reached the Dewan here, directed to the\r\nRajah; it was from the Governor-General at Bombay, and had been sent\r\nacross the country by special messengers: it demanded our instant\r\nrelease, or his Raj would be forfeited; and declared that if a hair of\r\nour heads were touched, his life should be the penalty.\r\n\r\n [328] Nothing would have been easier than for the Gangtok Kajee, or\r\n any other respectable man in Sikkim, to have overthrown the Dewan and\r\n his party; but these people are intolerably apathetic, and prefer\r\n being tyrannized over to the trouble of shaking off the yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rajah was also incessantly urging the Dewan to hasten us onwards as\r\nfree men to Dorjiling, but the latter took all remonstrances with\r\nassumed coolness, exercised his ponies, played at bow and arrow,\r\nintruded on us at mealtimes to be invited to partake, and loitered on\r\nthe road, changing garments and hats, which he pestered us to buy.\r\nNevertheless, be was evidently becoming daily more nervous and\r\nagitated.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rungmi valley we crossed on the 14th southward to that of\r\nRunniok, and descended to Dikkeeling, a large village of Dhurma\r\nBhoteeas (Bhotanese), which is much the most populous, industrious, and\r\nat the same time turbulent, in Sikkim. It is 4,950 feet above the sea,\r\nand occupies many broad cultivated spurs facing the south. This\r\ndistrict once belonged to Bhotan, and was ceded to the Sikkim Rajah by\r\nthe Paro Pilo,[329] in consideration of some military services,\r\nrendered by the former in driving off the Tibetans, who had usurped it\r\nfor the authorities of Lhassa. Since then the Sikkim and Bhotan people\r\nhave repeatedly fallen out, and Dikkeeling has become a refuge for\r\nrunaway Bhotanese, and kidnapping is constantly practised on this\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n [329] The temporal sovereign, in contra-distinction to the Dhurma\r\n Rajah, or spiritual sovereign of Bhotan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dewan halted us here for three days, for no assigned cause. On the\r\n16th, letters arrived, including a most kind and encouraging one from\r\nMr. Lushington, who had taken charge of Campbell’s office at Dorjiling.\r\nImmediately after arriving, the messenger was seized with violent\r\nvomitings and gripings: we could not help suspecting poison, especially\r\nas we were now amongst adherents of the Dewan, and the Bhotanese are\r\nnotorious for this crime. Only one means suggested itself for proving\r\nthis, and with Campbell’s permission I sent my compliments to the\r\nDewan, with a request for one of his hunting dogs to eat the vomit. It\r\nwas sent at once, and performed its duty without any ill effects. I\r\nmust confess to having felt a malicious pleasure in the opportunity\r\nthus afforded of showing our jailor how little we trusted him; feeling\r\nindignant at the idea that he should suppose he was making any way in\r\nour good opinion by his familiarities, which we were not in\r\ncircumstances to resist.\r\n\r\nThe crafty fellow, however, outwitted me by inviting us to dine with\r\nhim the same day, and putting our stomachs and noses to a severe test.\r\nOur dinner was served in Chinese fashion, but most of the luxuries,\r\nsuch as _béche-de-mer,_ were very old and bad. We ate, sometimes with\r\nchop-sticks, and at others with Tibetan spoons, knives, and two-pronged\r\nforks. After the usual amount of messes served in oil and salt water,\r\nsweets were brought, and a strong spirit. Thoba-sing, our filthy,\r\ncross-eyed spy, was waiter, and brought in every little dish with both\r\nhands, and raised it to his greasy forehead, making a sort of half bow\r\nprevious to depositing it before us. Sometimes he undertook to praise\r\nits contents, always adding, that in Tibet none but very great men\r\nindeed partook of such sumptuous fare. Thus he tried to please both us\r\nand the Dewan, who conducted himself with pompous hospitality, showing\r\noff what he considered his elegant manners and graces. Our blood boiled\r\nwithin us at being so patronised by the squinting ruffian, whose\r\ninsolence and ill-will had sorely aggravated the discomforts of our\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nNot content with giving us what he considered a magnificent dinner (and\r\nit had cost him some trouble), the Dewan produced a little bag from a\r\ndouble-locked escritoire, and took out three dinner-pills, which he had\r\nreceived as a great favour from the Rimbochay Lama, and which were a\r\nsovereign remedy for indigestion and all other ailments; he handed one\r\nto each of us, reserving the third for himself. Campbell refused his;\r\nbut there appeared no help for me, after my groundless suspicion of\r\npoison, and so I swallowed the pill with the best grace I could. But in\r\ntruth, it was not poison I dreaded in its contents, so much as being\r\ncompounded of some very questionable materials, such as the Rimbochay\r\nLama blesses and dispenses far and wide. To swallow such is a\r\nsanctifying work, according to Boodhist superstition, and I believe\r\nthere was nothing in the world, save his ponies, to which the Dewan\r\nattached a greater value.\r\n\r\nTo wind up the feast, we had pipes of excellent mild yellow Chinese\r\ntobacco called “Tseang,” made from _Nicotiana rustica,_ which is\r\ncultivated in East Tibet, and in West China according to MM. Huc and\r\nGabet. It resembles in flavour the finest Syrian tobacco, and is most\r\nagreeable when the smoke is passed through the nose. The common tobacco\r\nof India (_Nicotiana Tabacum_) is much imported into Tibet, where it is\r\ncalled “Tamma,” (probably a corruption of the Persian “Toombac,”) and\r\nis said to fetch the enormous price of 30_s._ per lb. at Lhassa, which\r\nis sixty times its value in India. Rice at Lhassa, when cheap, sells at\r\n2_s._ for 5 lbs.; it is, as I have elsewhere said, all bought up for\r\nrations for the Chinese soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe Bhotanese are more industrious than the Lepchas, and better\r\nhusbandmen; besides having superior crops of all ordinary grains, they\r\ngrow cotton, hemp, and flax. The cotton is cleansed here as elsewhere,\r\nwith a simple gin. The Lepchas use no spinning wheel, but a spindle and\r\ndistaff; their loom, which is Tibetan is a very complicated one framed\r\nof bamboo; it is worked by hand, without beam treddle, or shuttle.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th we were marched, three miles only, to Singdong (alt. 2,116\r\nfeet), and on the following day five miles farther, to Katong Ghat\r\n(alt. 750 feet), on the Teesta river, which we crossed with rafts, and\r\ncamped on the opposite bank, a few miles above the junction of this\r\nriver with the Great Rungeet. The water, which is sea-green in colour,\r\nhad a temperature of 53·5° at 4 p.m., and 51·7° the following morning;\r\nits current was very powerful. The rocks, since leaving Tunlloong, had\r\nbeen generally micaceous, striking north-west, and dipping north-east.\r\nThe climate was hot, and the vegetation on the banks tropical; on the\r\nhills around, lemon-bushes (“Kucheala,” Lepcha) were abundant, growing\r\napparently wild.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan was now getting into a very nervous and depressed state; he\r\nwas determined to keep up appearances before his followers, but was\r\nhimself almost servile to us; he caused his men to make a parade of\r\ntheir arms, as if to intimidate us, and in descending narrow gullies we\r\nhad several times the disagreeable surprise of finding some of his men\r\nat a sudden turn, with drawn bows and arrows pointed towards us. Others\r\ngesticulated with their long knives, and made fell swoops at soft\r\nplantain-stems; but these artifices were all as shallow as they were\r\ncontemptible, and a smile at such demonstrations was generally answered\r\nwith another from the actors.\r\n\r\nFrom Katong we ascended the steep east flank of Tendong or Mount\r\nArarat, through forests of Sal and long-leaved pine, to Namten (alt.\r\n4,483 feet), where we again halted two days. The Dingpun Tinli lived\r\nnear and waited on us with a present, which, with all others that had\r\nbeen brought, Campbell received officially, and transferred to the\r\nauthorities at Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan was thoroughly alarmed at the news here brought in, that the\r\nRajah’s present of yaks, ponies, etc., which had been sent forward, had\r\nbeen refused at Dorjiling; and equally so at the clamorous messages\r\nwhich reached him from all quarters, demanding our liberation; and at\r\nthe desertion of some of his followers, on hearing that large bodies of\r\ntroops were assembling at Dorjiling. Repudiated by his Rajah and\r\ncountrymen, and paralysed between his dignity and his ponies, which he\r\nnow perceived would not be welcomed at the station, and which were\r\ndaily losing flesh, looks, and value in these hot valleys, where there\r\nis no grass pasture, he knew not what olive-branch to hold out to our\r\ngovernment, except ourselves, whom he therefore clung to as hostages.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of December he marched us eight miles further, to Cheadam,\r\non a bold spur 4,653 feet high, overlooking the Great Rungeet, and\r\nfacing Dorjiling, from which it was only twenty miles distant. The\r\nwhite bungalows of our friends gladdened our eyes, while the new\r\nbarracks erecting for the daily arriving troops struck terror into the\r\nDewan’s heart. The six Sepoys[330] who had marched valiantly beside us\r\nfor twenty days, carrying the muskets given to the Rajah the year\r\nbefore by the Governor-General, now lowered their arms, and vowed that\r\nif a red coat crossed the Great Rungeet, they would throw down their\r\nguns and run away. News arrived that the Bhotan inhabitants of\r\nDorjiling headed by my bold Sirdar Nimbo, had arranged a night attack\r\nfor our release; an enterprise to which they were quite equal, and in\r\nwhich they have had plenty of practice in their own misgoverned\r\ncountry. Watch-fires gleamed amongst the bushes, we were thrust into a\r\ndoubly-guarded house, and bows and arrows were ostentatiously levelled\r\nso as to rake the doorway, should we attempt to escape. Some of the\r\nponies were sent back to Dikkeeling, though the Dewan still clung to\r\nhis merchandise and the feeble hope of traffic. The confusion increased\r\ndaily, but though Tchebu Lama looked brisk and confident, we were\r\nextremely anxious; scouts were hourly arriving from the road to the\r\nGreat Rungeet, and if our troops had advanced, the Dewan might have\r\nmade away with us from pure fear.\r\n\r\n [330] These Sepoys, besides the loose red jacket and striped Lepcha\r\n kirtle, wore a very curious national black hat of felt, with broad\r\n flaps turned up all round: this is represented in the right-hand\r\n figure. A somewhat similar bat is worn by some classes of Nepal\r\n soldiery.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lepcha sepoys. Tibetan sepoys in the back-ground.]\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon he paid us a long visit, and brought some flutes, of\r\nwhich he gave me two very common ones of apricot wood from Lhassa,\r\nproducing at the same time a beautiful one, which I believe he intended\r\nfor Campbell, but his avarice got the better, and he commuted his gift\r\ninto the offer of a tune, and pitching it in a high key, he went\r\nthrough a Tibetan air that almost deafened us by its screech. He tried\r\nbravely to maintain his equanimity, but as we preserved a frigid\r\ncivility and only spoke when addressed, the tears would start from his\r\neyes in the pauses of conversation. In the evening he came again; he\r\nwas excessively agitated and covered with perspiration, and thrust\r\nhimself unceremoniously between us on the bench we occupied. As his\r\nfamiliarity increased, he put his arm round my neck, and as he was\r\narmed with a small dagger, I felt rather uneasy about his intentions,\r\nbut he ended by forcing on my acceptance a coin, value threepence, for\r\nhe was in fact beside himself with terror.\r\n\r\nNext morning Campbell received a hint that this was a good opportunity\r\nfor a vigorous remonstrance. The Dewan came with Tchebu Lama, his own\r\nyounger brother (who was his pony driver), and the Lassoo Kajee. The\r\nlatter had for two months placed himself in an attitude of hostility\r\nopposite Dorjiling, with a ragged company of followers, but he now\r\nsought peace and friendship as much as the Dewan; the latter told us he\r\nwas waiting for a reply to a letter addressed to Mr. Lushington, after\r\nwhich he would set us free. Campbell said: “As you appear to have made\r\nup your mind, why not dismiss us at once?” He answered that we should\r\ngo the next day at all events: Here I came in, and on hearing from\r\nCampbell what had passed, I added, that he had better for his own sake\r\nlet us go at once; that the next day was our great and only annual\r\nPoojah (religious festival) of Christmas, when we all met; whereas he\r\nand his countrymen had dozens in the year. As for me, he knew I had no\r\nwife, nor children, nor any relation, within thousands of miles, and it\r\nmattered little where I was, he was only bringing ruin on himself by\r\nhis conduct to me as the Governor-General’s friend; but as regarded\r\nCampbell, the case was different; his home was at Dorjiling, which was\r\nswarming with English soldiers, all in a state of exasperation, and if\r\nhe did not let us depart before Christmas, he would find Dorjiling too\r\nhot to hold him, let him offer what reparation he might for the\r\ninjuries he had done us. I added: “We are all ready to go—dismiss us.”\r\nThe Dewan again turned to Campbell, who said, “I am quite ready; order\r\nus ponies at once, and send our luggage after us.” He then ordered the\r\nponies, and three men, including Meepo, to attend us; whereupon we\r\nwalked out, mounted, and made off with all speed.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the cane bridge over the Great Rungeet at 4 p.m., and to\r\nour chagrin found it in the possession of a posse of ragged Bhoteeas,\r\nthough there were thirty armed Sepoys of our own at the guard-house\r\nabove. At Meepo’s order they cut the network of fine canes by which\r\nthey had rendered the bridge impassable, and we crossed. The Sepoys at\r\nthe guard-house turned out with their clashing arms and bright\r\naccoutrements, and saluted to the sound of bugles; scaring our three\r\ncompanions, who ran back as fast as they could go. We rode up that\r\nnight to Dorjiling, and I arrived at 8 p.m. at Hodgson’s house, where I\r\nwas taken for a ghost, and received with shouts of welcome by my kind\r\nfriend and his guest Dr. Thomson, who had been awaiting my arrival for\r\nupwards of a month.\r\n\r\nThus terminated our Sikkim captivity, and my last Himalayan exploring\r\njourney, which in a geographical point of view had answered my purposes\r\nbeyond my most sanguine expectations, though my collections had been in\r\na great measure destroyed by so many untoward events. It enabled me to\r\nsurvey the whole country, and to execute a map of it, and Campbell had\r\nfurther gained that knowledge of its resources which the British\r\ngovernment should all along have possessed, as the protector of the\r\nRajah and his territories.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say a few words of the events that succeeded our release,\r\nin so far as they relate to my connection with them. The Dewan moved\r\nfrom Cheadam to Namtchi, immediately opposite Dorjiling, where he\r\nremained throughout the winter. The supreme government of Bengal\r\ndemanded of the Rajah that he should deliver up the most notorious\r\noffenders, and come himself to Dorjiling, on pain of an army marching\r\nto Tumloong to enforce the demand; a step which would have been easy,\r\nas there were neither troops, arms, ammunition, nor other means of\r\nresistance, even had there been the inclination to stop us, which was\r\nnot the case. The Rajah would in all probability have delivered himself\r\nup at Tumloong, throwing himself on our mercy, and the army would have\r\nsought the culprits in vain, both the spirit and the power to capture\r\nthem being wanting on the part of the people and their ruler.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah expressed his willingness, but pleaded his inability to\r\nfulfil the demand, whereupon the threat was repeated, and additional\r\nreinforcements were moved on to Dorjiling. The general officer in\r\ncommand at Dinapore was ordered to Dorjiling to conduct operations: his\r\nskill and bravery had been proved during the progress of the Nepal war\r\nso long ago as 1815. From the appearance of the country about\r\nDorjiling, he was led to consider Sikkim to be impracticable for a\r\nBritish army. This was partly owing to the forest-clad mountains, and\r\npartly to the fear of Tibetan troops coming to the Rajah’s aid, and the\r\nNepalese[331] taking the opportunity to attack us. With the latter we\r\nwere in profound peace, and we had a resident at their court; and I\r\nhave elsewhere shown the impossibility of a Tibet invasion, even if the\r\nChinese or Lhassan authorities were inclined to interfere in the\r\naffairs of Sikkim, which they long ago formally declined doing in the\r\ncase of aggressions of the Nepalese and Bhotanese, the Sikkim Rajah\r\nbeing under British protection.[332]\r\n\r\n [331] Jung Bahadoor was at this time planning his visit to England,\r\n and to his honour I must say, that on hearing of our imprisonment he\r\n offered to the government at Calcutta to release us with a handful of\r\n men. This he would no doubt have easily effected, but his offer was\r\n wisely declined, for the Nepalese (as I have elsewhere stated) want\r\n Sikkim and Bhotan too, and we had undertaken the protection of the\r\n former country, mainly to keep the Nepalese out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n [332] The general officer considered that our troops would have been\r\n cut to pieces if they entered the country; and the late General Sir\r\n Charles Napier has since given evidence to the same effect. Having\r\n been officially asked at the time whether I would guide a party into\r\n the country, and having drawn up (at the request of the general\r\n officer) plans for the purpose, and having given it as my opinion that\r\n it would not only have been feasible but easy to have marched a force\r\n in peace and safety to Tumloong, I feel it incumbent on me here to\r\n remark, that I think General Napier, who never was in Sikkim, and\r\n wrote from many hundred miles’ distance, must have misapprehended the\r\n state of the case. Whether an invasion of Sikkim was either advisable\r\n or called for, was a matter in which I had no concern: nor do I offer\r\n an opinion as to the impregnability of the country if it were defended\r\n by natives otherwise a match for a British force, and having the\r\n advantage of position. I was not consulted with reference to any\r\n difference of opinion between the civil and military powers, such as\r\n seems to have called for the expression of Sir Charles Napier’s\r\n opinion on this matter, and which appears to be considerably overrated\r\n in his evidence.\r\n    The general officer honoured me with his friendship at Dorjiling,\r\n    and to Mr. Lushington, I am, as I have elsewhere stated, under\r\n    great obligations for his personal consideration and kindness, and\r\n    vigorous measures during my detention. On my release and return to\r\n    Dorjiling, any interference on my part would have been meddling\r\n    with what was not my concern. I never saw, nor wished to see, a\r\n    public document connected with the affair, and have only given as\r\n    many of the leading features of the case as I can vouch for, and as\r\n    were accessible to any other bystander.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting offers of leading a company of soldiers to\r\nTumloong, rather than that the threat should have twice been made, and\r\nthen withdrawn; but they were not accepted. A large body of troops was\r\nhowever, marched from Dorjiling, and encamped on the north bank of the\r\nGreat Rungeet for some weeks: but after that period they were recalled,\r\nwithout any further demonstration; the Dewan remaining encamped the\r\nwhile on the Namtchi hill, not three hours’ march above them. The\r\nsimple Lepchas daily brought our soldiers milk, fowls, and eggs, and\r\nwould have continued to do so had they proceeded to Tumloong, for I\r\nbelieve both Rajah and people would have rejoiced at our occupation of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the troops, the threat was modified into a\r\nseizure of the Terai lands, which the Rajah had originally received as\r\na free gift from the British, and which were the only lucrative or\r\nfertile estates he possessed. This was effected by four policemen\r\ntaking possession of the treasury (which contained exactly twelve\r\nshillings, I believe), and announcing to the villagers the confiscation\r\nof the territory to the British government, in which they gladly\r\nacquiesced. At the same time there was annexed to it the whole southern\r\npart of Sikkim, between the Great Rungeet and the plains of India, and\r\nfrom Nepal on the west to the Bhotan frontier and the Teesta river on\r\nthe east; thus confining the Rajah to his mountains, and cutting off\r\nall access to the plains, except through the British territories. To\r\nthe inhabitants (about 5000 souls) this was a matter of congratulation,\r\nfor it only involved the payment of a small fixed tax in money to the\r\ntreasury at Dorjiling, instead of a fluctuating one in kind, with\r\nservice to the Rajah, besides exempting them from further annoyance by\r\nthe Dewan. At the present time the revenues of the tract thus acquired\r\nhave doubled, and will very soon be quadrupled: every expense of our\r\ndetention and of the moving of troops, etc., has been already repaid by\r\nit, and for the future all will be clear profit; and I am given to\r\nunderstand that this last year it has realized upwards of 30,000 rupees\r\n(£3000).\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell resumed his duties immediately afterwards, and the\r\nnewly-acquired districts were placed under his jurisdiction. The Rajah\r\nstill begs hard for the renewal of old friendship, and the restoration\r\nof his Terai land, or the annual grant of £300 a year which he formerly\r\nreceived. He has forbidden the culprits his court, but can do no more.\r\nThe Dewan, disgraced and turned out of office, is reduced to poverty,\r\nand is deterred from entering Tibet by the threat of being dragged to\r\nLhassa with a rope round his neck. Considering, however, his energy, a\r\nrare quality in these countries, I should not be surprised at his yet\r\ncutting a figure in Bhotan, if not in Sikkim itself: especially if, at\r\nthe Rajah’s death, the British government should refuse to take the\r\ncountry under its protection. The Singtam Soubah and the other culprits\r\nlive disgraced at their homes. Tchebu Lama has received a handsome\r\nreward, and a grant of land at Dorjiling, where he resides, and whence\r\nhe sends me his salaams by every opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII\r\n\r\nLeave Dorjiling for Calcutta—Jung Bahadoor—Dr. Falconer—Improvements in\r\nBotanic Gardens—Palmetum—Victoria—_Amherstia_—Orchids spread by\r\nseed—Banyan—_Cycas_—Importation of American plants in ice—Return to\r\nDorjiling—Leave with Dr. Thomson for the Khasia mountains—Mahanuddy\r\nriver—Vegetation of banks—Maldah—Alligators—Rampore-Bauleah—Climate of\r\nGanges—Pubna—Jummul river—Altered course of Burrampooter and\r\nMegna—Dacca—Conch shells—Saws—Cotton\r\nmuslins—Fruit—Vegetation—Elevation—Rose of Bengal—Burrampooter—Delta of\r\nSoormah river—Jheels—Soil—Vegetation—Navigation—Mosquitos—Atmospheric\r\npressure—Effects of geological changes—Imbedding of plants—Teelas or\r\nislets—Chattuc—Salubrious climate—Rains—Canoes—Pundua—Mr. Harry\r\nInglis—Terrya Ghat—Ascent to Churra—Scenery and vegetation at foot of\r\nmountains—Cascades.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was chiefly occupied during January and February of 1850, in\r\narranging and transmitting my collections to Calcutta, and completing\r\nmy manuscripts, maps, and surveys. My friend Dr. Thomson having joined\r\nme here, for the purpose of our spending a year in travelling and\r\nbotanising together, it became necessary to decide on the best field\r\nfor our pursuits. Bhotan offered the most novelty, but it was\r\ninaccessible to Europeans; and we therefore turned our thoughts to\r\nNepal, and failing that, to the Khasia mountains.\r\n\r\nThe better to expedite our arrangements, I made a trip to Calcutta in\r\nMarch, where I expected to meet both Lord Dalhousie, on his return from\r\nthe Straits of Malacca, and Jung Bahadoor (the Nepalese minister), who\r\nwas then _en route_ as envoy to England. I staid at Government House,\r\nwhere every assistance was afforded me towards obtaining the Nepal\r\nRajah’s permission to proceed through the Himalaya from Dorjiling to\r\nKatmandu. Jung Bahadoor received me with much courtesy, and expressed\r\nhis great desire to serve me; but begged me to wait until his return\r\nfrom England, as he could not be answerable for my personal safety when\r\ntravelling during his absence; and he referred to the permission he had\r\nformerly given me (and such was never before accorded to any European)\r\nin earnest of his disposition, which was unaltered. We therefore\r\ndetermined upon spending the season of 1850 in the Khasia mountains in\r\neastern Bengal, at the head of the great delta of the Ganges and\r\nBurrampooter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. Falconer’s residence, Calcutta Botanic Gardens,\r\nfrom Sir L. Peel’s grounds]\r\n\r\nI devoted a few days to the Calcutta Botanic Gardens, where I found my\r\nkind friend Dr. Falconer established, and very busy. The destruction of\r\nmost of the palms, and of all the noble tropical features of the\r\ngardens, during Dr. Griffith’s incumbency, had necessitated the\r\nreplanting of the greater part of the grounds, the obliteration of old\r\nwalks, and the construction of new: it was also necessary to fill up\r\ntanks whose waters, by injudicious cuttings, were destroying some of\r\nthe most valuable parts of the land, to drain many acres, and to raise\r\nembankments to prevent the encroachments of the Hoogly: the latter\r\nbeing a work attended with great expense, now cripples the resources of\r\nthe garden library, and other valuable adjuncts; for the trees which\r\nwere planted for the purpose having been felled and sold, it became\r\nnecessary to buy timber at an exorbitant price.\r\n\r\nThe avenue of Cycas trees (_Cycas circinalis_), once the admiration of\r\nall visitors, and which for beauty and singularity was unmatched in any\r\ntropical garden, had been swept away by the same unsparing hand which\r\nhad destroyed the teak, mahogany, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon groves.\r\nIn 1847, when I first visited the establishment, nothing was to be seen\r\nof its former beauty and grandeur, but a few noble trees or graceful\r\npalms rearing their heads over a low ragged jungle, or spreading their\r\nbroad leaves or naked limbs over the forlorn hope of a botanical\r\ngarden, that consisted of open clay beds, disposed in concentric\r\ncircles, and baking into brick under the fervid heat of a Bengal sun.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of growth is so great in this climate, that within eight\r\nmonths from the commencement of the improvements, a great change had\r\nalready taken place. The grounds bore a park-like appearance; broad\r\nshady walks had replaced the narrow winding paths that ran in distorted\r\nlines over the ground, and a large Palmetum, or collection of tall and\r\ngraceful palms of various kinds, occupied several acres at one side of\r\nthe garden; whilst a still larger portion of ground was being\r\nappropriated to a picturesque assemblage of certain closely allied\r\nfamilies of plants, whose association promised to form a novel and\r\nattractive object of study to the botanist, painter, and landscape\r\ngardener. This, which the learned Director called in scientific\r\nlanguage a Thamno-Endogenarium, consists of groups of all kinds of\r\nbamboos, tufted growing palms, rattan canes (_Calami_), _Dracænæ,_\r\nplantains, screw-pines, (_Pandani_), and such genera of tropical\r\nmonocotyledonous plants. All are evergreens of most vivid hue, some of\r\nwhich, having slender trailing stems, form magnificent masses; others\r\ntwine round one another, and present impenetrable hillocks of green\r\nfoliage; whilst still others shoot out broad long wavy leaves from\r\ntufted roots; and a fourth class is supported by aerial roots,\r\ndiverging on all sides and from all heights on the stems, every branch\r\nof which is crowned with an enormous plume of grass-like leaves.[333]\r\n\r\n [333] Since I left India, these improvements have been still further\r\n carried out, and now (in the spring of 1853) I read of five splendid\r\n _Victoria_ plants flowering at once, with _Euryale ferox,_ white,\r\n blue, and red water-lilies, and white, yellow and scarlet lotus,\r\n rendering the tanks gorgeous, sunk as their waters are in frames of\r\n green grass, ornamented with clumps of _Nipa fruticans_ and _Phœnix\r\n paludosa._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great _Amherstia_ tree had been nearly killed by injudicious\r\ntreatment, and the baking of the soil above its roots. This defect was\r\nremedied by sinking bamboo pipes four feet and a half in the earth, and\r\nwatering through them—a plan first recommended by Major M`Farlane of\r\nTavoy. Some fine _Orchideæ_ were in flower in the, gardens, but few of\r\nthem fruit; and those _Dendrobiums_ which bear axillary viviparous buds\r\nnever do. Some of the orchids appear to be spread by birds amongst the\r\ntrees; but the different species of _Vanda_ are increasing so fast,\r\nthat there seems no doubt that this tribe of air-plants grows freely\r\nfrom seed in a wild state, though we generally fail to rear them in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe great Banyan tree (_Ficus Indica_) is still the pride and ornament\r\nof the garden. Dr. Falconer has ascertained satisfactorily that it is\r\nonly seventy-five years old: annual rings, size, etc., afford no\r\nevidence in such a case, but people were alive a few years ago who\r\nremembered well its site being occupied in 1782 by a Kujoor\r\n(Date-palm), out of whose crown the Banyan sprouted, and beneath which\r\na Fakir sat. It is a remarkable fact that the banyan hardly ever\r\nvegetates on the ground; but its figs are eaten by birds, and the seeds\r\ndeposited in the crowns of palms, where they grow, sending down roots\r\nthat embrace and eventually kill the palm, which decays away. This tree\r\nis now eighty feet high, and throws an area 300 feet[334] in diameter\r\ninto a dark, cool shade. The gigantic limbs spread out about ten feet\r\nabove the ground, and from neglect during Dr. Wallich’s absence, there\r\nwere on Dr. Falconer’s arrival no more than eighty-nine descending\r\nroots or props; there are now several hundreds, and the growth of this\r\ngrand mass of vegetation is proportionably stimulated and increased.\r\nThe props are induced to sprout by wet clay and moss tied to the\r\nbranches, beneath which a little pot of water is hung, and after they\r\nhave made some progress, they are inclosed in bamboo tubes, and so\r\ncoaxed down to the ground. They are mere slender whip-cords before\r\nreaching the earth, where they root, remaining very lax for several\r\nmonths; but gradually, as they grow and swell to the size of cables,\r\nthey tighten, and eventually become very tense. This is a curious\r\nphenomenon, and so rapid, that it appears to be due to the rooting part\r\nmechanically dragging down the aerial. The branch meanwhile continues\r\nto grow outwards, and being supplied by its new support, thickens\r\nbeyond it, whence the props always slant outwards from the ground\r\ntowards the circumference of the tree.\r\n\r\n [334] Had this tree been growing in 1849 over the great palm-stove at\r\n Kew, only thirty feet of each end of that vast structure would have\r\n been uncovered: its increase was proceeding so rapidly, that by this\r\n time it could probably cover the whole. Larger banyans are common in\r\n Bengal; but few are so symmetrical in shape and height. As the tree\r\n gets old, it breaks up into separate masses, the original trunk\r\n decaying, and the props becoming separate trunks of the different\r\n portions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycas_ trees abound in the gardens, and, though generally having only\r\none, or rarely two crowns, they have sometimes sixteen, and their stems\r\nare everywhere covered with leafy buds, which are developed on any\r\ncheck being given to the growth of the plant, as by the operation of\r\ntransplantation, which will cause as many as 300 buds to appear in the\r\ncourse of a few years, on a trunk eight feet high.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at the gardens, Dr. Falconer received a box of living\r\nplants packed in moss, and transported in a frozen state by one of the\r\nice ships from North America:[335] they left in November, and arriving\r\nin March, I was present at the opening of the boxes, and saw 391 plants\r\n(the whole contents) taken out in the most perfect state. They were\r\nchiefly fruit-trees, apples, pears, peaches, currants, and\r\ngooseberries, with beautiful plants of the Venus’ fly-trap (_Dionæa\r\nmuscipula_). More perfect success never attended an experiment: the\r\nplants were in vigorous bud, and the day after being released from\r\ntheir icy bonds, the leaves sprouted and unfolded, and they were packed\r\nin Ward’s cases for immediate transport to the Himalaya mountains.\r\n\r\n [335] The ice from these ships is sold in the Calcutta market for a\r\n penny a pound, to great profit; it has already proved an invaluable\r\n remedy in cases of inflammation and fever, and has diminished\r\n mortality to a very appreciable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy visit to Calcutta enabled me to compare my instruments with the\r\nstandards at the Observatory, in which I was assisted by my friend,\r\nCapt. Thuillier, to whose kind offices on this and many other occasions\r\nI am greatly indebted.\r\n\r\nI returned to Dorjiling on the 17th of April, and Dr. Thomson and I\r\ncommenced our arrangements for proceeding to the Khasia mountains. We\r\nstarted on the 1st of May, and I bade adieu to Dorjiling with no light\r\nheart; for I was leaving the kindest and most disinterested friends I\r\nhad ever made in a foreign land, and a country whose mountains,\r\nforests, productions, and people had all become endeared to me by many\r\nties and associations. The prospects of Dorjiling itself are neither\r\ndoubtful nor insignificant. Whether or not Sikkim will fall again under\r\nthe protection of Britain, the station must prosper, and that very\r\nspeedily. I had seen both its native population and its European houses\r\ndoubled in two years; its salubrious climate, its scenery, and\r\naccessibility, ensure it so rapid a further increase that it will\r\nbecome the most populous hill-station in India. Strong prejudices\r\nagainst a damp climate, and the complaints of loungers and idlers who\r\nonly seek pleasure, together with a groundless fear of the natives,\r\nhave hitherto retarded its progress; but its natural advantages will\r\noutweigh these and all other obstacles.\r\n\r\nI am aware that my opinion of the ultimate success of Dorjiling is not\r\nshared by the general public of India, and must be pardoned for\r\nconsidering their views in this matter short-sighted. With regard to\r\nthe disagreeables of its climate, I can sufficiently appreciate them,\r\nand shall be considered by the residents to have over-estimated the\r\namount and constancy of mist, rain, and humidity, from the two seasons\r\nI spent there being exceptional in these respects. Whilst on the one\r\nhand I am willing to admit the probability of this,[336] I may be\r\nallowed on the other to say that I have never visited any spot under\r\nthe sun, where I was not told that the season was exceptional, and\r\ngenerally for the worse; added to which there is no better and equally\r\nsalubrious climate east of Nepal, accessible from Calcutta.\r\n\r\n [336] I am informed that hardly a shower of rain has fallen this\r\n season, between November 1852, and April 1853; and a very little snow\r\n in February only.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll climates are comparative, and fixed residents naturally praise\r\ntheir own. I have visited many latitudes, and can truly say that I have\r\nfound no two climates resembling each other, and that all alike are\r\ncomplained of. That of Dorjiling is above the average in point of\r\ncomfort, and for perfect salubrity rivals any; while in variety,\r\ninterest, and grandeur, the scenery is unequalled.\r\n\r\nFrom Sikkim to the Khasia mountains our course was by boat down the\r\nMahanuddy to the upper Gangetic delta, whose many branches we followed\r\neastwards to the Megna; whence we ascended the Soormah to the Silhet\r\ndistrict. We arrived at Kishengunj, on the Mahanuddy, on the 3rd of\r\nMay, and were delayed two days for our boat, which should have been\r\nwaiting here to take us to Berhampore on the Ganges: we were, however,\r\nhospitably received by Mr. Perry’s family.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the rains was indicated by violent easterly storms of\r\nthunder, lightning, and rain; the thermometer ranging from 70° to 85°.\r\nThe country around Kishengunj is flat and very barren; it is composed\r\nof a deep sandy soil, covered with a short turf, now swarming with\r\ncockchafers. Water is found ten or twelve feet below the surface, and\r\nmay be supplied by underground streams from the Himalaya, distant\r\nforty-five miles. The river, which at this season is low, may be\r\nnavigated up to Titalya during the rains; its bed averages 60 yards in\r\nwidth, and is extremely tortuous; the current is slight, and, though\r\nshallow, the water is opaque. We slowly descended to Maldah, where we\r\narrived on the 11th: the temperature both of the water and of the air\r\nincreased rapidly to upwards of 90°; the former was always a few\r\ndegrees cooler than the air by day, and warmer by night. The atmosphere\r\nbecame drier as we receded from the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe boatmen always brought up by the shore at night; and our progress\r\nwas so slow, that we could keep up with the boat when walking along the\r\nbank. So long as the soil and river-bed continued sandy, few bushes or\r\nherbs were to be found, and it was difficult to collect a hundred kinds\r\nof plants in a day: gradually, however, clumps of trees appeared, with\r\njujube bushes, _Trophis, Acacia,_ and _Buddleia,_ a few fan-palms,\r\nbamboos, and Jack-trees. A shell (_Anodon_) was the only one seen in\r\nthe river, which harboured few water-plants or birds, and neither\r\nalligators nor porpoises ascend so high.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May, about eighty miles in a straight line from the foot\r\nof the Himalaya, we found the stratified sandy banks, which had\r\ngradually risen to a height of thirteen feet, replaced by the hard\r\nalluvial clay of the Gangetic valley, which underlies the sand: the\r\nstream contracted, and the features of its banks were materially\r\nimproved by a jungle of tamarisk, wormwood (_Artemisia_), and white\r\nrose-bushes (_Rosa involucrata_), whilst mango trees became common,\r\nwith tamarinds, banyan, and figs. Date and _Caryota_ palms, and rattan\r\ncanes, grew in the woods, and parasitic Orchids on the trees, which\r\nwere covered with a climbing fern (_Acrosticum scandens_), so that we\r\neasily doubled our flora of the river banks before arriving at Maldah.\r\n\r\nThis once populous town is, like Berhampore, now quite decayed, since\r\nthe decline of its silk and indigo trades: the staple product, called\r\n“Maldy,” a mixture of silk and cotton, very durable, and which washes\r\nwell, now forms its only trade, and is exported through Sikkim to the\r\nnorth-west provinces and Tibet. It is still famous for the size and\r\nexcellence of its mangos, which ripen late in May; but this year the\r\ncrop had been destroyed by the damp heats of spring, the usual\r\nnorth-west dry winds not having prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the once famous city of Gour, a few miles distant, are now\r\ncovered with jungle, and the buildings are fast disappearing, owing to\r\nthe bricks being carried away to be used elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBelow Maldah the river gets broader, and willow becomes common. We\r\nfound specimens of a _Planorbis_ in the mud of the stream, and saw\r\napparently a boring shell in the alluvium, but could not land to\r\nexamine it. Chalky masses of alligators’ droppings, like coprolites,\r\nare very common, buried in the banks, which become twenty feet high at\r\nthe junction with the Ganges, where we arrived on the 14th. The waters\r\nof this great river were nearly two degrees cooler than those of the\r\nMahanuddy.\r\n\r\nRampore-Bauleah is a large station on the north bank of the Ganges,\r\nwhose stream is at this season fully a mile wide, with a very slow\r\ncurrent; its banks are thirty feet above the water. We were most kindly\r\nreceived by Mr. Bell, the collector of the district, to whom we were\r\ngreatly indebted for furthering us on our voyage: boats being very\r\ndifficult to procure, we were, however, detained here from the 16th to\r\nthe 19th. I was fortunate in being able to compare my barometers with a\r\nfirst-rate standard instrument, and in finding no appreciable\r\nalteration since leaving Calcutta in the previous April. The elevation\r\nof the station is 130 feet above the sea, that of Kishengunj I made\r\n131; so that the Gangetic valley is nearly a dead level for fully a\r\nhundred miles north, beyond which it rises; Titalya, 150 miles to the\r\nnorth, being 360 feet, and Siligoree, at the margin of the Terai,\r\nrather higher. The river again falls more considerably than the land;\r\nthe Mahanuddy, at Kishengunj, being about twenty feet below the level\r\nof the plains, or 110 above the sea; whereas the Ganges, at Rampore, is\r\nprobably not more than eighty feet, even when the water is highest.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Rampore is marked by greater extremes than that of\r\nCalcutta: during our stay the temperature rose above 106°, and fell to\r\n78° at night: the mean was 2·5° higher than at Calcutta, which is 126\r\nmiles further south. Being at the head of the Gangetic delta, which\r\npoints from the Sunderbunds obliquely to the north-west, it is much\r\ndamper than any locality further west, as is evidenced by two kinds of\r\n_Calamus_ palm abounding, which do not ascend the Ganges beyond\r\nMonghyr. Advancing eastwards, the dry north-west wind of the Gangetic\r\nvalley, which blows here in occasional gusts, is hardly felt; and\r\neasterly winds, rising after the sun (or, in other words, following the\r\nheating of the open dry country), blow down the great valley of the\r\nBurrampooter, or south-easterly ones come up from the Bay of Bengal.\r\nThe western head of the Gangetic delta is thus placed in what are\r\ncalled “the variables” in naval phraseology; but only so far as its\r\nsuperficial winds are concerned, for its great atmospheric current\r\nalways blows from the Bay of Bengal, and flows over all northern India,\r\nto the lofty regions of Central Asia.\r\n\r\nAt Rampore I found the temperature of the ground, at three feet depth,\r\nvaried from 87·8° to 89·8°, being considerably lower than that of the\r\nair (94·2°), whilst that of a fine ripening shaddock, into which I\r\nplunged a thermometer bulb, varied little from 81°, whether the sun\r\nshone on it or not. From this place we made very slow progress\r\nsouth-eastwards, with a gentle current, but against constant easterly\r\nwinds, and often violent gales and thunder-storms, which obliged us to\r\nbring up under shelter of banks and islands of sand. Sometimes we\r\nsailed along the broad river, whose opposite shores were rarely both\r\nvisible at once, and at others tracked the boat through narrow creeks\r\nthat unite the many Himalayan streams, and form a network soon after\r\nleaving their mountain valleys.\r\n\r\nA few miles beyond Pubna we passed from a narrow canal at once into the\r\nmain stream of the Burrampooter at Jaffergunj: our maps had led us to\r\nexpect that it flowed fully seventy miles to the eastward in this\r\nlatitude; and we were surprised to hear that within the last twenty\r\nyears the main body of that river had shifted its course thus far to\r\nthe westward. This alteration was not effected by the gradual working\r\nwestwards of the main stream, but by the old eastern channel so rapidly\r\nsilting up as to be now unnavigable; while the Jummul, which receives\r\nthe Teesta, and which is laterally connected by branches with the\r\nBurrampooter, became consequently wider and deeper, and eventually the\r\nprincipal stream.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more dreary and uninteresting than the scenery of this\r\npart of the delta. The water is clay-coloured and turbid, always cooler\r\nthan the air, which again was 4° or 5° below that of Calcutta, with a\r\ndamper atmosphere. The banks are of stratified sand and mud, hardly\r\nraised above the mean level of the country, and consequently unlike\r\nthose bordering most annually flooded rivers; for here the material is\r\nso unstable, that the current yearly changes its course. A wiry grass\r\nsometimes feebly binds the loose soil, on which there are neither\r\nhouses nor cultivation.\r\n\r\nAscending the Jummul (now the main channel of the Burrampooter) for a\r\nfew miles, we turned off into a narrower channel, sixty miles long,\r\nwhich passes by Dacca, where we arrived on the 28th, and where we were\r\nagain detained for boats, the demand for which is rapidly increasing\r\nwith the extended cultivation of the Sunderbunds and Delta. We stayed\r\nwith Mr. Atherton, and botanised in the neighbourhood of the town,\r\nwhich was once very extensive, and is still large, though not\r\nflourishing. The population is mostly Mahometan; the site, though\r\nbeautiful and varied, is unhealthy for Europeans. Ruins of great\r\nMoorish brick buildings still remain, and a Greek style of ornamenting\r\nthe houses prevails to a remarkable degree.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of rings for the arms and ancles, from conch-shells\r\nimported from the Malayan Archipelago, is still almost confined to\r\nDacca: the shells are sawn across for this purpose by semicircular\r\nsaws, the hands and toes being both actively employed in the operation.\r\nThe introduction of circular saws has been attempted by some European\r\ngentlemen, but steadily resisted by the natives, despite their obvious\r\nadvantages. The Dacca muslin manufacture, which once employed thousands\r\nof hands, is quite at an end, so that it was with great difficulty that\r\nthe specimens of these fabrics sent to the Great Exhibition of 1851,\r\nwere procured. The kind of cotton (which is very short in the staple)\r\nemployed, is now hardly grown, and scarcely a loom exists which is fit\r\nfor the finest fabrics. The jewellers still excel in gold and silver\r\nfilagree.\r\n\r\nPine-apples, plantains, mangos, and oranges, abound in the Dacca\r\nmarket, betokening a better climate for tropical fruits than that of\r\nWestern Bengal; and we also saw the fruit of _Euryale ferox,_[337]\r\nwhich is round, soft, pulpy, and the size of a small orange; it\r\ncontains from eight to fifteen round black seeds as large as peas,\r\nwhich are full of flour, and are eaten roasted in India and China, in\r\nwhich latter country the plant is said to have been in cultivation for\r\nupwards of 3000 years.\r\n\r\n [337] An Indian water-lily with a small red flower, covered everywhere\r\n with prickles, and so closely allied to _Victoria regia_ as to be\r\n scarcely generically distinguishable from it. It grows in the eastern\r\n Sunderbunds, and also in Kashmir. The discoverer of Victoria called\r\n the latter “_Euryale Amazonica._” These interestiug plants are growing\r\n side by side in the new Victoria house at Kew. The Chinese species has\r\n been erroneously considered different from the Indian one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe native vegetation is very similar to that of the Hoogly, except\r\nthat the white rose is frequent here. The fact of a plant of this genus\r\nbeing as common on the plains of Bengal as a dog-rose is in England,\r\nand associated with cocoa-nuts, palms, mangos, plantains, and banyans,\r\nhas never yet attracted the attention of botanists, though the species\r\nwas described by Roxburgh. As a geographical fact it is of great\r\nimportance, for the rose is usually considered a northern genus, and no\r\nkind but this inhabits a damp hot tropical climate. Even in mountainous\r\ncountries situated near the equator, as in the Himalaya and Andes, wild\r\nroses are very rare, and only found at great elevations, whilst they\r\nare unknown in the southern hemisphere. It is curious that this rose,\r\nwhich is also a native of Birma and the Indian Peninsula, does not in\r\nthis latitude grow west of the meridian of 87°; it is confined to the\r\nupper Gangetic delta, and inhabits a climate in which it would least of\r\nall be looked for.\r\n\r\nI made the elevation of Dacca by barometer only seventy-two feet above\r\nthe sea; and the banks of the Dallisary being high, the level of its\r\nwaters at this season is scarcely above that of the Bay of Bengal. The\r\nmean temperature of the air was 86·75° during our stay, or half a\r\ndegree lower than Calcutta at the same period.\r\n\r\nWe pursued our voyage on the 30th of May, to the old bed of the\r\nBurrampooter, an immense shallow sheet of water, of which the eastern\r\nbank is for eighty miles occupied by the delta of the Soormah. This\r\nriver rises on the Munnipore frontier, and flows through Cachar,\r\nSilhet, and the Jheels of east Bengal, receiving the waters of the\r\nCachar, Jyntea, Khasia, and Garrow mountains (which bound the Assam\r\nvalley to the south), and of the Tipperah hills, which stretch parallel\r\nto them, and divide the Soormah valley from the Bay of Bengal. The\r\nimmense area thus drained by the Soormah is hardly raised above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and covers about 10,000 square miles. The\r\nanastomosing rivers that traverse it, flow very gently, and do not\r\nmaterially alter their course; hence their banks gradually rise above\r\nthe mean level of the surrounding country, and on them the small\r\nvillages are built, surrounded by extensive rice-fields that need no\r\nartificial irrigation. At this season the general surface of the Jheels\r\nis marshy; but during the rains, which are excessive on the\r\nneighbouring mountains, they resemble an inland sea, the water rising\r\ngradually to within a few inches of the floor of the huts; as, however,\r\nit subsides as slowly in autumn, it commits no devastation. The\r\ncommunication is at all seasons by boats, in the management of which\r\nthe natives (chiefly Mahometans) are expert.\r\n\r\nThe want of trees and shrubs is the most remarkable feature of the\r\nJheels; in which respect they differ from the Sunderbunds, though the\r\nother physical features of each are similar, the level being exactly\r\nthe same: for this difference there is no apparent cause, beyond the\r\ninfluence of the tide and sea atmosphere. Long grasses of tropical\r\ngenera (_Saccharum, Donax, Andropogon,_ and _Rottbœllia_) ten feet\r\nhigh, form the bulk of the vegetation, with occasional low bushes along\r\nthe firmer banks of the natural canals that everywhere intersect the\r\ncountry; amongst these the rattan cane (_Calamus_), rose, a laurel,\r\n_Stravadium,_ and fig, are the most common; while beautiful convolvuli\r\nthrow their flowering shoots across the water.\r\n\r\nThe soil, which is sandy along the Burrampooter, is more muddy and\r\nclayey in the centre of the Jheels, with immense spongy accumulations\r\nof vegetable matter in the marshes, through which we poked the\r\nboat-staves without finding bottom: they were for the most part formed\r\nof decomposed grass roots, with occasionally leaves, but no quantity of\r\nmoss or woody plants. Along the courses of the greater streams drift\r\ntimber and various organic fragments are no doubt imbedded, but as\r\nthere is no current over the greater part of the flooded surface, there\r\ncan be little or no accumulation, except perhaps of old canoes, or of\r\nsuch vegetables as grow on the spot. The waters are dark-coloured, but\r\nclear and lucid, even at their height.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded up the Burrampooter, crossing it obliquely; its banks were\r\non the average five miles apart, and formed of sand, without clay, and\r\nvery little silt or mud: the water was clear and brown, like that of\r\nthe Jheels, and very different from that of the Jummul. We thence\r\nturned eastwards into the delta of the Soormah, which we traversed in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction to the stream itself. We often passed through\r\nvery narrow channels, where the grasses towered over the boats: the\r\nboatmen steered in and out of them as they pleased, and we were utterly\r\nat a loss to know how they guided themselves, as they had neither\r\ncompass nor map, and there were few villages or landmarks; and on\r\nclimbing the mast we saw multitudes of other masts and sails peeing\r\nover the grassy marshes, doing just the same as we did. All that go up\r\nhave the south-west wind in their favour, and this helps them to their\r\ncourse, but beyond this they have no other guide but that instinct\r\nwhich habit begets. Often we had to retreat from channels that promised\r\nto prove short cuts, but which turned out to be blind alleys. Sometimes\r\nwe sailed up broader streams of chesnut-brown water, accompanied by\r\nfleets of boats repairing to the populous districts at the foot of the\r\nKhasia, for rice, timber, lime, coal, bamboos, and long reeds for\r\nthatching, all of which employ an inland navy throughout the year in\r\ntheir transport to Calcutta.\r\n\r\nLeeches and mosquitos were very troublesome, the latter appearing in\r\nclouds at night; during the day they were rarer, but the species was\r\nthe same. A large cray-fish was common, but there were few birds and no\r\nanimals to be seen.\r\n\r\nFifty-four barometric observations, taken at the level of the water on\r\nthe voyage between Dacca and the Soormah, and compared with Calcutta,\r\nshowed a gradual rise of the mercury in proceeding eastwards; for\r\nthough the pressure at Calcutta was ·055 of an inch higher than at\r\nDacca, it was ·034 lower than on the Soormah: the mean difference\r\nbetween all these observations and the contemporaneous ones at Calcutta\r\nwas +·003 in favour of Calcutta, and the temperature half a degree\r\nlower; the dew-point and humidity were nearly the same at both places.\r\nThis being the driest season of the year, it is very probable that the\r\nmean level of the water at this part of the delta is not higher than\r\nthat of the Bay of Bengal; but as we advanced northwards towards the\r\nKhasia, and entered the Soormah itself, the atmospheric pressure\r\nincreased further, thus appearing to give the bed of that stream a\r\ndepression of thirty-five feet below the Bay of Bengal, into which it\r\nflows! This was no doubt the result of unequal atmospheric pressure at\r\nthe two localities, caused by the disturbance of the column of\r\natmosphere by the Khasia mountains; for in December of the same year,\r\nthirty-eight observations on the surface of the Soormah made its bed\r\nforty-six feet _above_ the Bay of Bengal, whilst, from twenty-three\r\nobservations on the Megna, the pressure only differed +0·020 of an inch\r\nfrom that of the barometer at Calcutta, which is eighteen feet above\r\nthe sea-level.\r\n\r\nThese barometric levellings, though far from satisfactory as compared\r\nwith trigonometric, are extremely interesting in the absence of the\r\nlatter. In a scientific point of view nothing has been done towards\r\ndetermining the levels of the land and waters of the great Gangetic\r\ndelta, since Rennell’s time, yet no geodetical operation promises more\r\nvaluable results in geography and physical geology than running three\r\nlines of level across its area; from Chittagong to Calcutta, from\r\nSilhet to Rampore, and from Calcutta to Silhet. The foot of the Sikkim\r\nHimalaya has, I believe, been connected with Calcutta by the great\r\ntrigonometrical survey, but I am given to understand that the results\r\nare not published.\r\n\r\nMy own barometric levellings would make the bed of the Mahanuddy and\r\nGanges at the western extremity of the delta, considerably higher than\r\nI should have expected, considering how gentle the current is, and that\r\nthe season was that of low water. If my observations are correct, they\r\nprobably indicate a diminished pressure, which is not easily accounted\r\nfor, the lower portion of the atmospheric column at Rampore being\r\nconsiderably drier and therefore heavier than at Calcutta. At the\r\neastern extremity again, towards Silhet, the atmosphere is much damper\r\nthan at Calcutta, and the barometer should therefore have stood lower,\r\nindicating a higher level of the waters than is the case.\r\n\r\nTo the geologist the Jheels and Sunderbunds are a most instructive\r\nregion, as whatever may be the mean elevation of their waters, a\r\npermanent depression of ten to fifteen feet would submerge an immense\r\ntract, which the Ganges, Burrampooter, and Soormah would soon cover\r\nwith beds of silt and sand. There would be extremely few shells in the\r\nbeds thus formed, the southern and northern divisions of which would\r\npresent two very different floras and faunas, and would in all\r\nprobability be referred by future geologists to widely different\r\nepochs. To the north, beds of peat would be formed by grasses, and in\r\nother parts, temperate and tropical forms of plants and animals would\r\nbe preserved in such equally balanced proportions as to confound the\r\npalæontologist; with the bones of the long-snouted alligator, Gangetic\r\nporpoise, Indian cow, buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant, tiger, deer, boar;\r\nand a host of other animals, he would meet with acorns of several\r\nspecies of oak, pine-cones and magnolia fruits, rose seeds, and _Cycas_\r\nnuts, with palm nuts, screw-pines, and other tropical productions. On\r\nthe other hand, the Sunderbunds portion, though containing also the\r\nbones of the tiger, deer, and buffalo, would have none of the Indian\r\ncow, rhinoceros, or elephant; there would be different species of\r\nporpoise, alligator, and deer, and none of the above mentioned plants\r\n(_Cycas,_ oak, pine, magnolia and rose), which would be replaced by\r\nnumerous others, all distinct from those of the Jheels, and many of\r\nthem indicative of the influence of salt water, whose proximity (from\r\nthe rarity of sea-shells) might not otherwise be suspected.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View in the Jheels]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June we entered the Soormah, a full and muddy stream\r\nflowing west, a quarter of a mile broad, with banks of mud and clay\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet high, separating it from marshes, and covered\r\nwith betel-nut and cocoa-nut palms, figs, and banyans. Many small\r\nvillages were scattered along the banks, each with a swarm of boats,\r\nand rude kilns for burning the lime brought from the Khasia mountains,\r\nwhich is done with grass and bushes. We ascended to Chattuc, against a\r\ngentle current, arriving on the 9th.\r\n\r\nFrom this place the Khasia mountains are seen as a long table-topped\r\nrange running east and west, about 4000 to 5000 feet high, with steep\r\nfaces towards the Jheels, out of which they appear to rise abruptly.\r\nThough twelve miles distant, large waterfalls are very clearly seen\r\nprecipitating themselves over the cliffs into a bright green mass of\r\nfoliage, that seems to creep half way up their flanks. The nearly\r\nhorizontal arrangement of the strata is as conspicuous here, as in the\r\nsandstone of the Kymore hills in the Soane valley, which these\r\nmountains a good deal resemble; but they are much higher, and the\r\nclimate is widely different. Large valleys enter the hills, and are\r\ndivided by hog-backed spurs, and it is far within these valleys that\r\nthe waterfalls and precipices occur; but the nearer and further cliffs\r\nbeing thrown by perspective into one range, they seem to rise out of\r\nthe Jheels so abruptly as to remind one of some precipitous island in\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nChattuc is mainly indebted for its existence to the late Mr. Inglis,\r\nwho resided there for upwards of sixty years, and opened a most\r\nimportant trade between the Khasia and Calcutta in oranges, potatos,\r\ncoal, lime, and timber. We were kindly received by his son, whose\r\nbungalow occupies a knoll, of which there are several, which attracted\r\nour attention as being the only elevations fifty feet high which we had\r\nascended since leaving the foot of the Sikkim Himalaya. They rise as\r\nislets (commonly called Teela, Beng.) out of the Jheels, within twelve\r\nto twenty miles of the Khasia; they are chiefly formed of stratified\r\ngravel and sand, and are always occupied by villages and large trees.\r\nThey seldom exceed sixty feet in height, and increase in number and\r\nsize as the hills are approached; they are probably the remains of a\r\ndeposit that was once spread uniformly along the foot of the mountains,\r\nand they in all respects resemble those I have described as rising\r\nabruptly from the plains near Titalya (see vol. i. p. 382).\r\n\r\nThe climate of Chattuc is excessively damp and hot throughout the year,\r\nbut though sunk amid interminable swamps, the place is perfectly\r\nhealthy! Such indeed is the character of the climate throughout the\r\nJheels, where fevers and agues are rare; and though no situations can\r\nappear more malarious to the common observer than Silhet and Cachar,\r\nthey are in fact eminently salubrious. These facts admit of no\r\nexplanation in the present state of our knowledge of endemic diseases.\r\nMuch may be attributed to the great amount and purity of the water, the\r\nequability of the climate, the absence of forests and of sudden changes\r\nfrom wet to dry; but such facts afford no satisfactory explanation. The\r\nwater, as I have above said, is of a rich chesnut-brown in the narrow\r\ncreeks of the Jheels, and is golden yellow by transmitted light, owing\r\nno doubt, as in bog water and that of dunghills, to a vegetable\r\nextractive and probably the presence of carburetted hydrogen. Humboldt\r\nmentions this dark-coloured water as prevailing in some of the swamps\r\nof the Cassiquares, at the junction of the Orinoco and Amazon, and\r\ngives much curious information on its accompanying features of animal\r\nand vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThe rains generally commence in May: they were unusually late this\r\nyear, though the almost daily gales and thunder-storms we experienced,\r\nforetold their speedy arrival. From May till October they are\r\nunremitting, and the country is under water, the Soormah rising about\r\nfifty feet. North-easterly winds prevail, but they are a local current\r\nreflected from the Khasia, against which the southerly perennial\r\ntrade-wind impinges. Westerly winds are very rare, but the dry\r\nnorth-west blasts of India have been known to traverse the delta and\r\nreach this meridian, in one or two short hot dry puffs during March and\r\nApril. Hoarfrost is unknown.[338]\r\n\r\n [338] It however forms further south, at the very mouth of the Megna,\r\n and is the effect of intense radiation when the thermometer in the\r\n shade falls to 45°.\r\n\r\n\r\nChina roses and tropical plants (_Bignoniæ, Asclepiadeæ,_ and\r\n_Convolvuli_) rendered Mr. Inglis’ bungalow gay, but little else will\r\ngrow in the gardens. Pine-apples are the best fruit, and oranges from\r\nthe foot of the Khasia: plantains ripen imperfectly, and the mango is\r\nalways acid, attacked by grubs, and having a flavour of turpentine. The\r\nviolent hailstorms of the vernal equinox cut both spring and cold\r\nseason flowers and vegetables, and the rains destroy all summer\r\nproducts. The soil is a wet clay, in which some European vegetables\r\nthrive well if planted in October or November. We were shown marrowfat\r\npeas that had been grown for thirty years without degenerating in size,\r\nbut their flavour was poor.\r\n\r\nSmall long canoes, paddled rapidly by two men, were procured here,\r\nwhereby to ascend the narrow rivers that lead up to the foot of the\r\nmountains: they each carry one passenger, who lies along the bottom,\r\nprotected by a bamboo platted arched roof. We started at night, and\r\nearly the next morning arrived at Pundua,[339] where there is a\r\ndilapidated bungalow: the inhabitants are employed in the debarkation\r\nof lime, coal, and potatos. Large fleets of boats crowded the narrow\r\ncreeks, some of the vessels being of several tons burden.\r\n\r\n [339] Pundua, though an insignificant village, surrounded by swamps,\r\n has enjoyed an undue share of popularity as a botanical region. Before\r\n the geographical features of the country north of Silhet were known,\r\n the plants brought from those hills by native collectors were sent to\r\n the Calcutta garden (and thence to Europe) as from Pundua. Hence\r\n Silhet mountains and Pundua mountains, both very erroneous terms, are\r\n constantly met with in botanical works, and generally refer to plants\r\n growing in the Khasia mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nElephants were kindly sent here for us by Mr. H. Inglis, to take us to\r\nthe foot of the mountains, about three miles distant, and relays of\r\nmules and ponies to ascend to Churra, where we were received with the\r\ngreatest hospitality by that gentleman, who entertained us till the end\r\nof June, and procured us servants and collectors. To his kind offices\r\nwe were also indebted throughout our travels in the Khasia, for much\r\ninformation, and for facilities and necessaries of all kinds: things in\r\nwhich the traveller is more dependent on his fellow countrymen in\r\nIndia, than in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nWe spent two days at Pundua, waiting for our great boats (which drew\r\nseveral feet of water), and collecting in the vicinity. The old\r\nbungalow, without windows and with the roof falling in, was a most\r\nmiserable shelter; and whichever way we turned from the door, a river\r\nor a swamp lay before us. Birds, mosquitos, leeches, and large wasps\r\nswarmed, also rats and sandflies. A more pestilential hole cannot be\r\nconceived; and yet people traverse this district, and sleep here at all\r\nseasons of the year with impunity. We did so ourselves in the month of\r\nJune, when the Sikkim and all other Terais are deadly: we returned in\r\nSeptember, traversing the Jheels and nullahs at the very foot of the\r\nhills during a short break of fine weather in the middle of the rains;\r\nand we again slept here in November,[340] always exposed in the heat of\r\nthe day to wet and fatigue, and never having even a _soupçon_ of fever,\r\nague, or rheumatism. This immunity does not, however, extend to the\r\nvery foot of the hills, as it is considered imprudent to sleep at this\r\nseason in the bungalow of Terrya, only three miles off.\r\n\r\n [340] At the north foot of the Khasia, in the heavily timbered dry\r\n Terai stretching for sixty miles to the Burrampooter, it is almost\r\n inevitable death for a European to sleep, any time between the end of\r\n April and of November. Many have crossed that tract, but not one\r\n without taking fever: Mr. H. Inglis was the only survivor of a party\r\n of five, and he was ill from the effects for upwards of two years,\r\n after having been brought to death’s door by the first attack, which\r\n came on within three weeks of his arrival at Churra, and by several\r\n relapses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Pundua bungalow is about forty feet above the sea, and\r\nthat of the waters surrounding it, from ten to thirty, according to the\r\nseason. In June the mean of the barometer readings at the bungalow was\r\nabsolutely identical with that of the Calcutta barometer, In September\r\nit was 0·016 inch lower, and in November 0·066 lower. The mean annual\r\ntemperature throughout the Jheels is less than 2° below that of\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\nTerrya bungalow lies at the very foot of the first rise of the\r\nmountains; on the way we crossed many small streams upon the elephants,\r\nand one large one by canoes: the water in all was cool[341] and\r\nsparkling, running rapidly over boulders and pebbles. Their banks of\r\nsandy clay were beautifully fringed with a willow-like laurel,\r\n_Ehretia_ bushes, bamboos, palms, _Bauhinia, Bombax,_ and _Erythrina,_\r\nover which _Calamus_ palm (rattan) and various flowering plants\r\nclimbed. The rock at Terrya is a nummulitic limestone, worn into\r\nextensive caverns. This formation is said to extend along the southern\r\nflank of the Khasia, Garrow, and Jyntea mountains, and to be associated\r\nwith sandstone and coal: it is extensively quarried in many places,\r\nseveral thousand tons being annually shipped for Calcutta and Dacca. It\r\nis succeeded by a horizontally stratified sandstone, which is continued\r\nup to 4000 feet, where it is overlain by coal-beds and then by\r\nlimestone again.\r\n\r\n [341] Temperature in September 77° to 80°; and in November 75·7°.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sub-tropical scenery of the lower and outer Sikkim Himalaya, though\r\non a much more gigantic scale, is not comparable in beauty and\r\nluxuriance with the really tropical vegetation induced by the hot,\r\ndamp, and insular climate of these perennially humid mountains. At the\r\nHimalaya forests of gigantic trees, many of them deciduous, appear from\r\na distance as masses of dark gray foliage, clothing mountains 10,000\r\nfeet high: here the individual trees are smaller, more varied in kind,\r\nof a brilliant green, and contrast with gray limestone and red\r\nsandstone rocks and silvery cataracts. Palms are more numerous\r\nhere;[342] the cultivated _Areca_ (betel-nut) especially, raising its\r\ngraceful stem and feathery crown, “like an arrow shot down from\r\nheaven,” in luxuriance and beauty above the verdant slopes. This\r\ndifference is at once expressed to the Indian botanist by defining the\r\nKhasia flora as of Malayan character; by which is meant the prevalence\r\nof brilliant glossy-leaved evergreen tribes of trees (as _Euphorbiaceæ_\r\nand _Urticeæ_), especially figs, which abound in the hot gulleys, where\r\nthe property of their roots, which inosculate and form natural grafts,\r\nis taken advantage of in bridging streams, and in constructing what are\r\ncalled living bridges, of the most picturesque forms. _Combretaceæ,_\r\noaks, oranges, _Garcinia_ (gamboge), _Diospyros,_ figs, Jacks,\r\nplantains, and _Pandanus,_ are more frequent here, together with\r\npinnated leaved _Leguminosæ, Meliaceæ,_ vines and peppers, and above\r\nall palms, both climbing ones with pinnated shining leaves (as\r\n_Calamus_ and _Plectocomia_), and erect ones with similar leaves (as\r\ncultivated cocoa-nut, _Areca_ and _Arenga_), and the broader-leaved\r\nwild betel-nut, and beautiful _Caryota_ or wine-palm, whose immense\r\ndecompound leaves are twelve feet long. Laurels and wild nutmegs, with\r\n_Henslowia, Itea,_ etc., were frequent in the forest, with the usual\r\nprevalence of parasites, mistleto, epiphytical _Orchideæ, Æshynanthus,_\r\nferns, mosses, and _Lycopodia_; and on the ground were _Rubiaceæ,\r\nScitamineæ,_ ferns, _Acanthaceæ,_ beautiful balsams, and herbaceous and\r\nshrubby nettles. Bamboos[343] of many kinds are very abundant, and\r\nthese hills further differ remarkably from those of Sikkim in the great\r\nnumber of species of grasses.\r\n\r\n [342] There are upwards of twenty kinds of Palm in this district,\r\n including _Chamærops,_ three species of _Areca,_ two of _Wallichia,\r\n Arenga, Caryota,_ three of _Phœnix, Plectocomia, Licuala,_ and many\r\n species of _Calamus._ Besides these there are several kinds of\r\n _Pandanus,_ and the _Cycas pectinata._\r\n\r\n\r\n [343] The natives enumerate about fourteen different kinds of bamboo,\r\n of which we found five in flower, belonging to three very distinct\r\n genera. Uspar, Uspet, Uspit, Usken, Uskong, Uktang, Usto, Silee,\r\n Namlang, Tirra, and Battooba are some of the names of Bamboos vouched\r\n for by Mr. Inglis as correctly spelt. Of other Khasia names of plants,\r\n Wild Plantains are called Kairem, and the cultivated Kakesh; the\r\n latter are considered so nourishing that they are given to newborn\r\n infants. Senteo is a flower in Khas, So a fruit, Ading a tree, and Te\r\n a leaf. _Pandanus_ is Kashelan. _Plectocomia,_ Usmole. _Licuala,_\r\n Kuslow. _Caryota,_ Kalai-katang. _Wallichia,_ Kalai-nili. _Areca,_\r\n Waisola. Various _Calami_ are Rhimet, Uriphin, Ureek hilla, Tindrio,\r\n etc. This list will serve as a specimen; I might increase it\r\n materially, but as I have elsewhere observed, the value attached to\r\n the supposed definite application of native names to natural objects\r\n is greatly over-rated, and too much reliance on them has introduced a\r\n prodigious amount of confusion into scientific works and philological\r\n inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was at first gradual, along the sides of a sandstone spur.\r\nAt 2000 feet the slope suddenly became steep and rocky, at 3000 feet\r\ntree vegetation disappeared, and we opened a magnificent prospect of\r\nthe upper scarped flank of the valley of Moosmai, which we were\r\nascending, with four or five beautiful cascades rolling over the table\r\ntop of the hills, broken into silvery foam as they leapt from ledge to\r\nledge of the horizontally stratified precipice, and throwing a veil of\r\nsilver gauze over the gulf of emerald green vegetation, 2000 feet\r\nbelow. The views of the many cataracts of the first class that are thus\r\nprecipitated over the bare table-land on which Churra stands, into the\r\nvalleys on either side, surpass anything of the kind that I have\r\nelsewhere seen, though in many respects vividly recalling the scenery\r\naround Rio de Janeiro: nor do I know any spot in the world more\r\ncalculated to fascinate the naturalist who, while appreciating the\r\nelements of which a landscape is composed, is also keenly alive to the\r\nbeauty and grandeur of tropical scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Living bridge formed of the aerial roots of the\r\nindia-rubber and other kinds of figs.]\r\n\r\nAt the point where this view opens, a bleak stony region commences,\r\nbearing numberless plants of a temperate flora and of European genera,\r\nat a comparatively low elevation; features which continue to the top of\r\nthe flat on which the station is built, 4000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dewan’s ear-ring]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII\r\n\r\nChurra, English station of—Khasia people—Garrow\r\npeople—Houses—Habits—Dress—Arms—Dialects—Marriages—Food—Funerals—\r\nSuperstitions—Flat of Churra—Scenery—Lime and\r\ncoal—Mamloo—Cliffs—Cascades—_Chamærops_ palm—Jasper-rocks—Flora of\r\nChurra—Orchids—Rhododendrons—Pine—Climate—Extraordinary rain-fall—Its\r\neffects—Gardens of Lieuts.

A rapid postal communication is\r\nhereby secured: but the extreme unhealthiness of the northern foot of\r\nthe mountains effectually precludes all other intercourse for nine\r\nmonths in the year.\r\n\r\nOn the first opening up of the country, the Europeans were brought into\r\nsanguinary collision with the Khasias, who fought bravely with bows and\r\narrows, displaying a most blood-thirsty and cruel disposition. This is\r\nindeed natural to them; and murders continued very frequent as preludes\r\nto the most trifling robberies, until the extreme penalty of our law\r\nwas put in force. Even now, some of the tributary Rajahs are far from\r\nquiet under our rule, and various parts of the country are not safe to\r\ntravel in. The Garrows, who occupy the western extremity of this range,\r\nat the bend of the Burrampooter, are still in a savage state. Human\r\nsacrifices and polyandry are said to be frequent amongst them, and\r\ntheir orgies are detestable. Happily we are hardly ever brought into\r\ncollision with them, except by their occasional depredations on the\r\nAssam and Khasia frontier: their country is very unhealthy, and is said\r\nto contain abundance of coal, iron, and lime.\r\n\r\nWe seldom employed fewer than twelve or fourteen of the natives as\r\ncollectors, and when travelling, from thirty to forty as coolies, etc.\r\nThey are averse to rising early, and are intolerably filthy in their\r\npersons, though not so in their cottages, which are very poor, with\r\nbroad grass roofs reaching nearly to the ground, and usually encircled\r\nby bamboo fences; the latter custom is not common in savage\r\ncommunities, and perhaps indicates a dread of treachery. The beams are\r\nof hewn wood (they do not use saws), often neatly carved, and the doors\r\nturn on good wooden pivots. They have no windows, and the fire is made\r\non the floor: the utensils, etc. are placed on hanging shelves and in\r\nbaskets.\r\n\r\nThe Khasia people are of the Indo-Chinese race; they are short, very\r\nstout, and muscular, with enormous calves and knees, rather narrow eyes\r\nand little beard, broad, high cheekbones, flat noses, and open\r\nnostrils. I believe that a few are tattooed. The hair is gathered into\r\na top-knot, and sometimes shaved off the forehead and temples. A loose\r\ncotton shirt, often striped blue and red, without sleeves and bordered\r\nwith long thread fringes, is their principal garment; it is gathered\r\ninto a girdle of silver chains by people of rank. A cotton robe is\r\nsometimes added, with a large cotton turban or small skull-cap. The\r\nwomen wear a long cloth tied in a knot across the breast. During\r\nfestivals both men and women load themselves with silk robes, fans,\r\npeacock’s feathers, and gold and silver ornaments of great value,\r\nprocured from Assam, many of which are said to be extremely curious,\r\nbut I regret to say that I never saw any of them. On these occasions\r\nspirits are drunk, and dancing kept up all night: the dance is\r\ndescribed as a slow ungraceful motion, the women being tightly swathed\r\nin cloths.\r\n\r\nAll their materials are brought from Assam; the only articles in\r\nconstant use, of their own manufacture, being a rude sword or knife\r\nwith a wooden handle and a long, narrow, straight blade of iron, and\r\nthe baskets with head-straps, like those used by the Lepchas, but much\r\nneater; also a netted bag of pine-apple fibre (said to come from\r\nSilhet) which holds a clasp-knife, comb, flint, steel, and betel-nut\r\nbox. They are much addicted to chewing pawn (betel-nut, pepper leaves,\r\nand lime) all day long, and their red saliva looks like blood on the\r\npaths. Besides the sword I have described, they carry bows and arrows,\r\nand rarely a lance, and a bamboo wicker-work shield.\r\n\r\nWe found the Khasias to be sulky intractable fellows, contrasting\r\nunpleasantly with the Lepchas; wanting in quickness, frankness, and\r\ndesire to please, and obtrusively independent in manner; nevertheless\r\nwe had a head man who was very much the reverse of this, and whom we\r\nhad never any cause to blame. Their language is, I believe,\r\nIndo-Chinese and monosyllabic: it is disagreeably nasal and guttural,\r\nand there are several dialects and accents in contiguous villages. All\r\ninflections are made by prefixing syllables, and when using the Hindoo\r\nlanguage, the future is invariably substituted for the past tense. They\r\ncount up to a hundred, and estimate distances by the number of\r\nmouthfuls of pawn they eat on the road.\r\n\r\nEducation has been attempted by missionaries with partial success, and\r\nthe natives are said to have shown themselves apt scholars. Marriage is\r\na very loose tie amongst them, and hardly any ceremony attends it. We\r\nwere informed that the husband does not take his wife home, but enters\r\nher father’s household, and is entertained there. Divorce and an\r\nexchange of wives is common, and attended with no disgrace: thus the\r\nson often forgets his father’s name and person before he grows up, but\r\nbecomes strongly attached to his mother. The sister’s son inherits both\r\nproperty and rank, and the proprietors’ or Rajahs’ offspring are\r\nconsequently often reared in poverty and neglect. The usual toy of the\r\nchildren is the bow and arrow, with which they are seldom expert; they\r\nare said also to spin pegtops like the English, climb a greased pole,\r\nand run round with a beam turning horizontally on an upright, to which\r\nit is attached by a pivot.\r\n\r\nThe Khasias eat fowls, and all meat, especially pork, potatos and\r\nvegetables, dried and half putrid fish in abundance, but they have an\r\naversion to milk, which is very remarkable, as a great proportion of\r\ntheir country is admirably adapted for pasturage. In this respect,\r\nhowever, they assimilate to the Chinese, and many Indo-Chinese nations\r\nwho are indifferent to milk, as are the Sikkim people. The Bengalees,\r\nHindoos, and Tibetans, on the other hand, consume immense quantities of\r\nmilk. They have no sheep, and few goats or cattle, the latter of which\r\nare kept for slaughter; they have, however, plenty of pigs and fowls.\r\nEggs are most abundant, but used for omens only, and it is a common,\r\nbut disgusting occurrence, to see large groups employed for hours in\r\nbreaking them upon stones, shouting and quarrelling, surrounded by the\r\nmixture of yellow yolks and their red pawn saliva.\r\n\r\nThe funeral ceremonies are the only ones of any importance, and are\r\noften conducted with barbaric pomp and expense; and rude stones of\r\ngigantic proportions are erected as monuments, singly or in rows,\r\ncircles, or supporting one another, like those of Stonehenge, which\r\nthey rival in dimensions and appearance. The body is burned, though\r\nseldom during the rains, from the difficulty of obtaining a fire; it is\r\ntherefore preserved in honey (which is abundant and good) till the dry\r\nseason: a practice I have read of as prevailing among some tribes in\r\nthe Malay peninsula. Spirits are drunk on these occasions; but the hill\r\nKhasia is not addicted to drunkenness, though some of the natives of\r\nthe low valleys are very much so. These ascend the rocky faces of the\r\nmountains by ladders, to the Churra markets, and return loaded at\r\nnight, apparently all but too drunk to stand; yet they never miss their\r\nfooting in places which are most dangerous to persons unaccustomed to\r\nsuch situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The table-land and station of Churra, with the jheels,\r\ncourse of the Soormah River, and Tipperah Hills in the extreme\r\ndistance, looking south.]\r\n\r\nThe Khasias are superstitious, but have no religion; like the Lepchas,\r\nthey believe in a supreme being, and in deities of the grove, cave, and\r\nstream. Altercations are often decided by holding the disputants’ heads\r\nunder water, when the longest winded carries his point. Fining is a\r\ncommon punishment, and death for grave offences. The changes of the\r\nmoon are accounted for by the theory that this orb, who is a man,\r\nmonthly falls in love with his wife’s mother, who throws ashes in his\r\nface. The sun is female; and Mr. Yule[344] (who is my authority) says\r\nthat the Pleiades are called “the Hen-man” (as in Italy “the\r\nchickens”); also that they have names for the twelve months; they do\r\nnot divide their time by weeks, but hold a market every four days.\r\nThese people are industrious, and good cultivators of rice, millet, and\r\nlegumes of many kinds. Potatoes were introduced amongst them about\r\ntwenty years ago by Mr. Inglis, and they have increased so rapidly that\r\nthe Calcutta market is now supplied by their produce. They keep bees in\r\nrude hives of logs of wood.\r\n\r\n [344] I am indebted to Mr. Inglis for most of this information\r\n relating to the Khasias, which I have since found, with much more that\r\n is curious and interesting, in a paper by Lieut. Yule in Bengal Asiat.\r\n Soc. Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flat table-land on which Churra Poonji is placed, is three miles\r\nlong and two broad, dipping abruptly in front and on both sides, and\r\nrising behind towards the main range, of which it is a spur. The\r\nsurface of this area is everywhere intersected by shallow, rocky\r\nwatercourses, which are the natural drains for the deluge that annually\r\nvisits it. The western part is undulated and hilly, the southern rises\r\nin rocky ridges of limestone and coal, and the eastern is very flat and\r\nstony, broken only by low isolated conical mounds.\r\n\r\nThe scenery varies extremely at different parts of the surface. Towards\r\nthe flat portion, where the English reside, the aspect is as bleak and\r\ninhospitable as can be imagined: a thin stratum of marshy or sandy soil\r\ncovers a tabular mass of cold red sandstone; and there is not a tree,\r\nand scarcely a shrub to be seen, except occasional clumps of Pandanus.\r\nThe low white bungalows are few in number, and very scattered, some of\r\nthem being a mile asunder, enclosed with stone walls and shrubs; and a\r\nsmall white church, disused on account of the damp, stands lonely in\r\nthe centre of all.\r\n\r\nThe views from the margins of this plateau are magnificent: 4000 feet\r\nbelow are bay-like valleys, carpetted as with green velvet, from which\r\nrise tall palms, tree-ferns with spreading crowns, and rattans shooting\r\ntheir pointed heads, surrounded with feathery foliage, as with ostrich\r\nplumes, far above the great trees. Beyond are the Jheels, looking like\r\na broad shallow sea with the tide half out, bounded in the blue\r\ndistance by the low-hills of Tipperah. To the right and left are the\r\nscarped red rocks and roaring waterfalls, shooting far over the\r\ncliff’s, and then arching their necks as they expand in feathery foam,\r\nover which rainbows float, forming and dissolving as the wind sways the\r\ncurtains of spray from side to side.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Churra the lime and coal measures rise abruptly in\r\nflat-topped craggy hills, covered with brushwood and small trees.\r\nSimilar hills are seen far westward across the intervening valleys in\r\nthe Garrow country, rising in a series of steep isolated ranges, 300 to\r\n400 feet above the general level of the country, and always skirting\r\nthe south face of the mountains. Considerable caverns penetrate the\r\nlimestone, the broken surface of which rock presents many picturesque\r\nand beautiful spots, like the same rocks in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mamloo cascades]\r\n\r\n\r\nWestward the plateau becomes very hilly, bare, and grassy, with the\r\nstreams broad and full, but superficial and rocky, precipitating\r\nthemselves in low cascades over tabular masses of sand-stone. At Mamloo\r\ntheir beds are deeper, and full of brushwood, and a splendid valley and\r\namphitheatre of red cliffs and cascades, rivalling those of Moosmai (p.\r\n261), bursts suddenly into view. Mamloo is a large village, on the top\r\nof a spur, to the westward: it is buried in a small forest,\r\nparticularly rich in plants, and is defended by a stone wall behind:\r\nthe only road is tunnelled through the sandstone rock, under the wall;\r\nand the spur on either side dips precipitously, so that the place is\r\nalmost impregnable if properly defended. A sanguinary conflict took\r\nplace here between the British and the Khasias, which terminated in the\r\nlatter being driven over the precipices, beneath which many of them\r\nwere shot. The fan-palm, _Chamærops Khasiana_ (“Pakha,” Khas.), grows\r\non the cliff’s near Mamloo: it may be seen on looking over the edge of\r\nthe plateau, its long curved trunk rising out of the naked rocks, but\r\nits site is generally inaccessible;[345] while near it grows the\r\n_Saxifragis ciliaris_ of our English gardens, a common plant in the\r\nnorth-west Himalaya, but extremely scarce in Sikkim and the Khasia\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n [345] This species is very closely allied to, if not identical with\r\n _P. Martiana_ of Nepal; which ascends to 8000 feet in the western\r\n Himalaya, where it is annually covered with snow: it is not found in\r\n Sikkim, but an allied species occurs in Affghanistan, called _P.\r\n Ritcheana_: the dwarf palm of southern Europe is a fourth species.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe descent of the Mamloo spur is by steps, alternating with pebbly\r\nflats, for 1500 feet, to a saddle which connects the Churra hills with\r\nthose of Lisouplang to the westward. The rise is along a very steep\r\nnarrow ridge to a broad long grassy hill, 3,500 feet high, whence an\r\nextremely steep descent leads to the valley of the Boga-panee, and the\r\ngreat mart of Chela, which is at the embouchure of that river. The\r\ntransverse valley thus formed by the Mamloo spur, is full of orange\r\ngroves, whose brilliant green is particularly conspicuous from above.\r\nAt the saddle below Mamloo are some jasper rocks, which are the\r\nsandstone altered by basalt. Fossil shells are recorded to have been\r\nfound by Dr. M’Lelland[346] on some of the flats, which he considers to\r\nbe raised beaches: but we sought in vain for any evidence of this\r\ntheory beyond the pebbles, whose rounding we attributed to the action\r\nof superficial streams.\r\n\r\n [346] See a paper on the geology of the Khasia mountains by Dr.\r\n M’Lelland in the “Bengal Asiatic Society’s Journal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to give within the limits of this narrative\r\nany idea of the Khasia flora, which is, in extent and number of fine\r\nplants, the richest in India, and probably in all Asia. We collected\r\nupwards of 2000 flowering plants within ten miles of the station of\r\nChurra, besides 150 ferns, and a profusion of mosses, lichens, and\r\nfungi. This extraordinary exuberance of species is not so much\r\nattributable to the elevation, for the whole Sikkim Himalaya (three\r\ntimes more elevated) does not contain 500 more flowering plants, and\r\nfar fewer ferns, etc.; but to the variety of exposures; namely, 1. the\r\nJheels, 2. the tropical jungles, both in deep, hot, and wet valleys,\r\nand on drier slopes; 3. the rocks; 4. the bleak table-lands and stony\r\nsoils; 5. the moor-like uplands, naked and exposed, where many species\r\nand genera appear at 5000 to 6000 feet, which are not found on the\r\nouter ranges of Sikkim under 10,000.[347] In fact, strange as it may\r\nappear, owing to this last cause, the temperate flora descends fully\r\n4000 feet lower in the latitude of Khasia (25° N.) than in that of\r\nSikkim (27° N.), though the former is two degrees nearer the equator.\r\n\r\n [347] As _Thalictrum, Anemone,_ primrose, cowslip, _Tofieldia,_ Yew,\r\n Pine, Saxifrage, _Delphinium, Pedicularis._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Pandanus_ alone forms a conspicuous feature in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Churra; while the small woods about Mamloo, Moosmai, and\r\nthe coal-pits, are composed of _Symplocos,_ laurels, brambles, and\r\njasmines, mixed with small oaks and _Photinia,_ and many tropical\r\ngenera of trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n_Orchideæ_ are, perhaps, the largest natural order in the Khasia, where\r\nfully 250 kinds grow, chiefly on trees and rocks, but many are\r\nterrestrial, inhabiting damp woods and grassy slopes. I doubt whether\r\nin any other part of the globe the species of orchids outnumber those\r\nof any other natural order, or form so large a proportion of the flora.\r\nBalsams are next in relative abundance (about twenty-five), both\r\ntropical and temperate kinds, of great beauty and variety in colour,\r\nform, and size of blossom. Palms amount to fourteen, of which the\r\n_Chamærops_ and _Arenga_ are the only genera not found in Sikkim. Of\r\nbamboos there are also fifteen, and of other grasses 150, which is an\r\nimmense proportion, considering that the Indian flora (including those\r\nof Ceylon, Kashmir, and all the Himalaya), hardly contains 400.\r\n_Scitamineæ_ also are abundant, and extremely beautiful; we collected\r\nthirty-seven kinds.\r\n\r\nNo rhododendron grows at Churra, but several species occur a little\r\nfurther north: there is but one pine (_P. Khasiana_) besides the yew,\r\n(and two _Podocarpi_), and that is only found in the drier interior\r\nregions. Singular to say, it is a species not seen in the Himalaya or\r\nelsewhere, but very nearly allied to _Pinua longifolia,_[348] though\r\nmore closely resembling the Scotch fir than that tree does.\r\n\r\n [348] Cone-bearing pines with long leaves, like the common Scotch fir,\r\n are found in Asia, and as far south as the Equator (in Borneo) and\r\n also inhabit Arracan, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and South China.\r\n It is a very remarkable fact that no Gymnospermous tree inhabits the\r\n Peninsula of India; not even the genus _Podocarpus,_ which includes\r\n most of the tropical Gymnosperms, and is technically coniferous, and\r\n has glandular woody fibre; though like the yew it bears berries. Two\r\n species of this genus are found in the Khasia, and one advances as far\r\n west as Nepal. The absence of oaks and of the above genera\r\n (_Podocarpus_ and _Pinus_) is one of the most characteristic\r\n differences between the botany of the east and west shores of the Bay\r\n of Bengal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural orders whose rarity is most noticeable, are _Cruciferæ,_\r\nrepresented by only three kinds, and _Caryophylleæ._ Of _Ranunculaceæ,_\r\nthere are six or seven species of _Clematis,_ two of _Anemone,_ one\r\n_Delphinium,_ three of _Thalictrum,_ and two _Ranunculi._ _Compositæ_\r\nand _Leguminosæ_ are far more numerous than in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Khasia is remarkable for the excessive rain-fall.\r\nAttention was first drawn to this by Mr. Yule, who stated, that in the\r\nmonth of August, 1841, 264 inches fell, or twenty-two feet; and that\r\nduring five successive days, thirty inches fell in every twenty-four\r\nhours! Dr. Thomson and I also recorded thirty inches in one day and\r\nnight, and during the seven months of our stay, upwards of 500 inches\r\nfell, so that the total annual fall perhaps greatly exceeded 600\r\ninches, or fifty feet, which has been registered in succeeding years!\r\nFrom April, 1849, to April, 1850, 502 inches (forty-two feet) fell.\r\nThis unparalleled amount is attributable to the abruptness of the\r\nmountains which face the Bay of Bengal, from which they are separated\r\nby 200 miles of Jheels and Sunderbunds.\r\n\r\nThis fall is very local: at Silhet, not thirty miles further south, it\r\nis under 100 inches; at Gowahatty, north of the Khasia in Assam, it is\r\nabout 80; and even on the hills, twenty miles inland from Churra\r\nitself, the fall is reduced to 200. At the Churra station, the\r\ndistribution of the rain is very local; my gauges, though registering\r\nthe same amount when placed beside a good one in the station; when\r\nremoved half a mile, received a widely different quantity, though the\r\ndifferent gauges gave nearly the same mean amount at the end of each\r\nwhole month.\r\n\r\nThe direct effect of this deluge is to raise the little streams about\r\nChurra fourteen feet in as many hours, and to inundate the whole flat;\r\nfrom which, however, the natural drainage is so complete, as to render\r\na tract, which in such a climate and latitude should be clothed with\r\nexuberant forest, so sterile, that no tree finds support, and there is\r\nno soil for cultivation of any kind whatsoever, not even of rice.\r\nOwing, however, to the hardness of the horizontally stratified\r\nsandstone, the streams have not cut deep channels, nor have the\r\ncataracts worked far back into the cliffs. The limestone alone seems to\r\nsuffer, and the turbid streams from it prove how rapidly it is becoming\r\ndenuded. The great mounds of angular gravel on the Churra flat, are\r\nperhaps the remains of an extensive deposit, fifty feet thick,\r\nelsewhere washed away by these rains; and I have remarked traces of the\r\nsame over many slopes of the hills around.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of Churra (elev. 4000 feet) is about 66°, or 16°\r\nbelow that of Calcutta; which, allowing for 2·5° of northing, gives 1°\r\nof temperature to every 290 to 300 feet of ascent. In summer the\r\nthermometer often rises to 88° and 90°; and in the winter, owing to the\r\nintense radiation, hoar-frost is frequent. Such a climate is no less\r\ninimical to the cultivation of plants, than is the wretched soil: of\r\nthis we saw marked instances in the gardens of two of the resident\r\nofficers, Lieutenants Raban and Cave, to whom we were indebted for the\r\ngreatest kindness and hospitality. These gentlemen are indefatigable\r\nhorticulturists, and took a zealous interest in our pursuits,\r\naccompanying us in our excursions, enriching our collections in many\r\nways, and keeping an eye to them and to our plant-driers during our\r\nabsence from the station. In their gardens the soil had to be brought\r\nfrom a considerable distance, and dressed copiously with vegetable\r\nmatter. Bamboo clumps were planted for shelter within walls, and native\r\nshrubs, rhododendrons, etc., introduced. Many _Orchideæ_ throve well on\r\nthe branches of the stunted trees which they had planted, and some\r\nsuperb kinds of _Hedychium_ in the ground; but a very few English\r\ngarden plants throve in the flower-beds. Even in pots and frames,\r\ngeraniums, etc., would rot, from the rarity of sunshine, which is as\r\nprejudicial as the damp and exposure. Still many wild shrubs of great\r\ninterest and beauty flourished, and some European ones succeeded with\r\nskill and management; as geraniums, _Salvia, Petunia,_ nasturtium,\r\nchrysanthemum, _Kennedya rubicunda, Maurandya,_ and Fuchsia. The daisy\r\nseed sent from England as double, came up very poor and single. Dahlias\r\ndo not thrive, nor double balsams. Now they have erected small but airy\r\ngreen-houses, and sunlight is the only desideratum.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June, we started for the northern or Assam face of the\r\nmountains. The road runs between the extensive and populous native\r\nvillage, or poonji, on the left, and a deep valley on the right, and\r\ncommands a beautiful view of more waterfalls. Beyond this it ascends\r\nsteeply, and the sandstone on the road itself is curiously divided into\r\nparallelograms, like hollow bricks,[349] enclosing irregularly shaped\r\nnodules, while in other places it looks as if it had been run or fused:\r\nspherical concretions of sand, coloured concentrically by infiltration,\r\nare common in it, which have been regarded as seeds, shells, etc.; it\r\nalso contained spheres of iron pyrites. The general appearance of much\r\nof this rock is as if it had been bored by _Teredines_ (ship worms),\r\nbut I never detected any trace of fossils. It is often beautifully\r\nripple-marked, and in some places much honeycombed, and full of shales\r\nand narrow seams of coal, resting on a white under-clay full of\r\nroot-fibres, like those of _Stigmaria._\r\n\r\n [349] I have seen similar bricks in the sandstones of the\r\n coal-districts of Yorkshire; they are very puzzling, and are probably\r\n due to some very obscure crystalline action analogous to jointing and\r\n cleavage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about 5000 feet the country is very open and bare, the ridges being\r\nso uniform and flat-topped, that the broad valleys they divide are\r\nhidden till their precipitous edges are reached; and the eye wanders\r\nfar east and west over a desolate level grassy country, unbroken, save\r\nby the curious flat-topped hills I have described as belonging to the\r\nlimestone formation, which lie to the south-west. These features\r\ncontinue for eight miles, when a sudden descent of 600 or 700 feet,\r\nleads into the valley of the Kala-panee (Black water) river, where\r\nthere is a very dark and damp bungalow, which proved a very great\r\naccommodation to us.[350]\r\n\r\n [350] It may be of use to the future botanist in this country to\r\n mention a small wood on the right of this road, near the village of\r\n Surureem, as an excellent botanical station: the trees are chiefly\r\n _Rhododendron arboreum,_ figs, oaks, laurels, magnolias, and\r\n chestnuts, on whose limbs are a profusion of _Orchideæ,_ and amongst\r\n which a Rattan palm occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLailang-kot is another village full of iron forges, from a height near\r\nwhich a splendid view is obtained over the Churra flat. A few old and\r\nvery stunted shrubs of laurel and _Symplocos_ grow on its bleak\r\nsurface, and these are often sunk from one to three feet in a well in\r\nthe horizontally stratified sandstone. I could only account for this by\r\nsupposing it to arise from the drip from the trees, and if so, it is a\r\nwonderful instance of the wearing effects of water, and of the great\r\nage which small bushes sometimes attain.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation is more alpine at Kala-panee (elevation, 5,300 feet);\r\n_Benthamia, Kadsura, Stauntonia, Illicium, Actinidia, Helwingia,\r\nCorylopsis,_ and berberry—all Japan and Chinese, and most of them\r\nDorjiling genera—appear here, with the English yew, two rhododendrons,\r\nand _Bucklandia._ There are no large trees, but a bright green jungle\r\nof small ones and bushes, many of which are very rare and curious.\r\n_Luculia Pinceana_ makes a gorgeous show here in October.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone to the east of Kala-panee is capped by some beds, forty\r\nfeet thick, of conglomerate worn into cliffs; these are the remains of\r\na very extensive horizontally stratified formation, now all but\r\nentirely denuded. In the valley itself, the sandstone alternates with\r\nalum shales, which rest on a bed of quartz conglomerate, and the latter\r\non black greenstone. In the bed of the river, whose waters are\r\nbeautifully clear, are hornstone rocks, dipping north-east, and\r\nstriking north-west. Beyond the Kalapanee the road ascends about 600\r\nfeet, and is well quarried in hard greenstone; and passing through a\r\nnarrow gap of conglomerate rock,[351] enters a shallow, wild, and\r\nbeautiful valley, through which it runs for several miles. The hills on\r\neither side are of greenstone capped by tabular sandstone, immense\r\nmasses of which have been precipitated on the floor of the valley,\r\nproducing a singularly wild and picturesque scene. In the gloom of the\r\nevening it is not difficult for a fertile imagination to fancy castles\r\nand cities cresting the heights above.[352]\r\n\r\n [351] Formed of rolled masses of greenstone and sandstone, united by a\r\n white and yellow cement.\r\n\r\n\r\n [352] _Hydrangea_ grows here, with ivy, _Mussœnda, Pyrua,_ willow,\r\n _Viburnum, Parnassia, Anemone, Leycesteria formosa, Neillia, Rubus,\r\n Astilbe,_ rose, _Panax,_ apple, _Bucklandia, Daphne,_ pepper,\r\n _Scindapsus, Pierix,_ holly, _Lilium giganteum_ (“Kalang tatti,”\r\n Khas.), _Camellia, Elæocarpus, Buddleia,_ etc. Large bees’ nests hang\r\n from the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is some cultivation here of potatoes, and of _Rhysicosia vestita_\r\na beautiful purple-flowered leguminous plant, with small tuberous\r\nroots. Beyond this, a high ridge is gained above the valley of the\r\nBoga-panee, the largest river in the Khasia; from this the Bhotan\r\nHimalaya may be seen in clear weather, at the astonishing distance of\r\nfrom 160 to 200 miles! The vegetation here suddenly assumes a different\r\naspect, from the quantity of stunted fir-trees clothing the north side\r\nof the valley, which rises very steeply 1000 feet above the river:\r\nquite unaccountably, however, not one grows on the south face. A new\r\noak also appears abundantly; it has leaves like the English, whose\r\ngnarled habit it also assumes.\r\n\r\nThe descent is very steep, and carried down a slope of greenstone;[353]\r\nthe road then follows a clear affluent of the Boga-panee, and\r\nafterwards winds along the margin of that river, which is a rapid\r\nturbulent stream, very muddy, and hence contrasting remarkably with the\r\nKala-panee. It derives its mud from the decomposition of granite, which\r\nis washed by the natives for iron, and in which rock it rises to the\r\neastward. Thick beds of slate crop out by the roadside (strike\r\nnorth-east and dip north-west), and are continued along the bed of the\r\nriver, passing into conglomerates, chert, purple slates, and\r\ncrystalline sandstones, with pebbles, and angular masses of schist.\r\nMany of these rocks are much crumpled, others quite flat, and they are\r\noverlaid by soft, variegated gneiss, which is continued alternately\r\nwith the slates to the top of the hills on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n [353] This greenstone decomposes into a thick bed of red clay; it is\r\n much intersected by fissures or cleavage planes at all angles, whose\r\n surfaces are covered with a shining polished superficial layer; like\r\n the fissures in the cleavage planes of the gneiss granite of\r\n Kinchinjhow, whose adjacent surfaces are coated with a glassy waved\r\n layer of hornblende. This polishing of the surfaces is generally\r\n attributed to their having been in contact and rubbed together, an\r\n explanation which is wholly unsatisfactory to me; no such motion could\r\n take place in cleavage planes which often intersect, and were it to\r\n occur, it would not produce two polished surfaces of an interposed\r\n layer of a softer mineral. It is more probably due to metamorphic\r\n action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall trees of hornbeam grow near the river, with _Rhus, Xanthoxylon,\r\nVaccinium, Gualtheria,_ and _Spiræa,_ while many beautiful ferns,\r\nmosses, and orchids cover the rocks. An elegant iron suspension-bridge\r\nis thrown across the stream, from a rock matted with tufts of little\r\nparasitic _Orchideæ._ Crossing it, we came on many pine-trees; these\r\nhad five-years’ old cones on them, as well as those of all succeeding\r\nyears; they bear male flowers in autumn, which impregnate the cones\r\nformed the previous year. Thus, the cones formed in the spring of 1850\r\nare fertilised in the following autumn, and do not ripen their seeds\r\ntill the second following autumn, that of 1852.\r\n\r\nA very steep ascent leads to the bungalow of Moflong, on a broad, bleak\r\nhill-top, near the axis of the range (alt. 6,062 feet). Here there is a\r\nvillage, and some cultivation, surrounded by hedges of _Erythrina,\r\nPieris, Viburnum,_ _Pyres, Colquhounia,_ and _Corylopsis,_ amongst\r\nwhich grew an autumn-flowering lark-spur, with most fœtid flowers.[354]\r\nThe rocks are much contorted slates and gneiss (strike north-east and\r\ndip south-east). In a deep gulley to the northward, greenstone appears,\r\nwith black basalt and jasper, the latter apparently altered gneiss:\r\nbeyond this the rocks strike the opposite way, but are much disturbed.\r\n\r\n [354] There is a wood a mile to the west of the bungalow, worth\r\n visiting by the botanist: besides yew, oak, _Sabia_ and _Camellia,_ it\r\n contains _Olea, Euonymus,_ and _Sphærocarya,_ a small tree that bears\r\n a green pear-shaped sweet fruit, with a large stone: it is pleasant,\r\n but leaves a disagreeable taste in the mouth. On the grassy flats an\r\n _Astragalus_ occurs, and _Roscœa purpurea, Tofieldia,_ and various\r\n other fine plants are common.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe passed the end of June here, and experienced the same violent\r\nweather, thunder, lightning, gales, and rain, which prevailed during\r\nevery midsummer I spent in India. A great deal of _Coix_ (Job’s tears)\r\nis cultivated about Moflong: it is of a dull greenish purple, and\r\nthough planted in drills, and carefully hoed and weeded, is a very\r\nragged crop. The shell of the cultivated sort is soft, and the kernel\r\nis sweet; whereas the wild _Coix_ is so hard that it cannot be broken\r\nby the teeth. Each plant branches two or three times from the base, and\r\nfrom seven to nine plants grow in each square yard of soil: the produce\r\nis small, not above thirty or forty fold.\r\n\r\nFrom a hill behind Moflong bungalow, on which are some stone altars, a\r\nmost superb view is obtained of the Bhotan Himalaya to the northward,\r\ntheir snowy peaks stretching in a broken series from north 17° east to\r\nnorth 35° west; all are below the horizon of the spectator, though from\r\n17,000 to 20,000 feet above his level. The finest view in the Khasia\r\nmountains, and perhaps a more extensive one than has ever before been\r\ndescribed, is that from Chillong hill, the culminant point of the\r\nrange, about six miles north-east from Moflong bungalow. This hill,\r\n6,660 feet above the sea, rises from an undulating grassy country,\r\ncovered with scattered trees and occasional clumps of wood; the whole\r\nscenery about being park-like, and as little like that of India at so\r\nlow an elevation as it is possible to be.\r\n\r\nI visited Chillong in October with Lieutenant Cave; starting from\r\nChurra, and reaching the bungalow, two miles from its top, the same\r\nnight, with two relays of ponies, which he had kindly provided. We were\r\nunfortunate in not obtaining a brilliant view of the snowy mountains,\r\ntheir tops being partially clouded; but the _coup d’œil_ was superb.\r\nNorthward, beyond the rolling Khasia hills, lay the whole Assam valley,\r\nseventy miles broad, with the Burrampooter winding through it, fifty\r\nmiles distant, reduced to a thread. Beyond this, banks of hazy vapour\r\nobscured all but the dark range of the Lower Himalaya, crested by peaks\r\nof frosted silver, at the immense distance of from 100 to 220 miles\r\nfrom Chillong. All are below the horizon of the observer; yet so false\r\nis perspective, that they seem high in the air. The mountains occupy\r\nsixty degrees of the horizon, and stretch over upwards of 250 miles,\r\ncomprising the greatest extent of snow visible from any point with\r\nwhich I am acquainted.\r\n\r\nWestward from Chillong the most distant Garrow hills visible are about\r\nforty miles off; and eastward those of Cachar, which are loftier, are\r\nabout seventy miles. To the south the view is limited by the Tipperah\r\nhills, which, where nearest, are 100 miles distant; while to the\r\nsouth-west lies the sea-like Gangetic delta, whose horizon, lifted by\r\nrefraction, must be fully 120. The extent of this view is therefore\r\nupwards of 340 miles in one direction, and the visible horizon of the\r\nobserver encircles an area of fully thirty thousand square miles, which\r\nis greater than that of Ireland!\r\n\r\nScarlet-flowered rhododendron bushes cover the north side of\r\nChillong,[355] whilst the south is grassy and quite bare; and except\r\nsome good _Orchideæ_ on the trees, there is little to reward the\r\nbotanist. The rocks appeared to be sandstone at the summit, but\r\nmicaceous gneiss all around.\r\n\r\n [355] These skirt a wood of prickly bamboo, in which occur fig,\r\n laurel, _Aralia, Bœmeria, Smilax, Toddalia,_ wild cinnamon, and three\r\n kinds of oak.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing northward from Moflong, the road, after five miles, dips\r\ninto a very broad and shallow flat-floored valley, fully a mile across,\r\nwhich resembles a lake-bed: it is bounded by low hills, and is called\r\n“Lanten-tannia,” and is bare of aught but long grass and herbs; amongst\r\nthese are the large groundsel (_Senecio_), _Dipsacus, Ophelia,_ and\r\n_Campanula._ On its south flank the micaceous slates strike north-east,\r\nand dip north-west, and on the top repose beds, a foot in thickness, of\r\nangular water-worn gravel, indicating an ancient water-level, 400 feet\r\nabove the floor of the valley. Other smaller lake-beds, in the lateral\r\nvalleys, are equally evident.\r\n\r\nA beautiful blue-flowered _Clitoria_ creeps over the path, with the\r\nground-raspberry of Dorjiling. From the top a sudden descent of 400\r\nfeet leads to another broad flat valley, called “Syong” (elevation,\r\n5,725 feet), in which is a good bungalow, surrounded by hedges of\r\n_Prinsepia utilis,_ a common north-west Himalayan plant, only found at\r\n8000 feet in Sikkim. The valley is grassy, but otherwise bare. Beyond\r\nthis the road passes over low rocky hills, wooded on their north or\r\nsheltered flanks only, dividing flat-floored valleys: a red sandy\r\ngneiss is the prevalent rock, but boulders of syenite are scattered\r\nabout. Extensive moors (elevation, 6000 feet) succeed, covered with\r\nstunted pines, brake, and tufts of harsh grasses.[356]\r\n\r\n [356] These are principally _Andropogon_ and _Brachypodium,_ amongst\r\n which grow yellow _Corydalis, Thalictrum, Anemone, Parnassia,\r\n Prunella,_ strawberry, _Eupatorium, Hypericum,_ willow, a _Polygonum_\r\n like _Bistorta, Osmunda regalis_ and another species _Lycopodium\r\n alpinum,_ a _Senecio_ like _Jacobæa,_ thistles, _Gnaphalium,_\r\n Gentians, _Iris, Paris, Sanguisorba_ and _Agrimonia._\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the Dengship-oong (river), which flows in a narrow valley, is a\r\nlow dome of gneiss altered by syenite. The prevalent dip is uniformly\r\nsouth-east, and the strike north-east; and detached boulders of syenite\r\nbecome more frequent, resting on a red gneiss, full of black garnets,\r\ntill the descent to the valley of Myrung, one of the most beautiful\r\nspots in the Khasia, and a favourite resort, having an excellent\r\nbungalow which commands a superb view of the Himalaya: it is 5,650 feet\r\nabove the sea, and is placed on the north flank of a very shallow\r\nmarshy valley, two miles broad, and full of rice cultivation, as are\r\nthe flat heads of all the little valleys that lead into it. There is a\r\nguard here of light infantry, and a little garden, boasting a gardener\r\nand some tea-plants, so that we had vegetables during our four visits\r\nto the place, on two of which occasions we stayed some days.\r\n\r\nFrom Kala-panee to Myrung, a distance of thirty-two miles, the road\r\ndoes not vary 500 feet above or below the mean level of 5,700 feet, and\r\nthe physical features are the same throughout, of broad flat-floored,\r\nsteep-sided valleys, divided by bleak, grassy, tolerably level-topped\r\nbills. Beyond Myrung the Khasia mountains slope to the southward in\r\nrolling loosely-wooded hills, but the spurs do not dip suddenly till\r\nbeyond Nunklow, eight miles further north.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the Myrung valley is Nungbree wood, a dense\r\njungle, occupying, like all the other woods, the steep north exposure\r\nof the hill; many good plants grow in it, including some gigantic\r\n_Balanophoræ, Pyrola,_ and _Monotropa._ The bungalow stands on soft,\r\ncontorted, decomposing gneiss, which is still the prevalent rock,\r\nstriking north-east. On the hills to the east of it, enormous hard\r\nblocks lie fully exposed, and are piled on one another, as if so\r\ndisposed by glacial action; and it is difficult to account for them by\r\ndenudation, though their surface scales, and similar blocks are\r\nscattered around Myrung exactly similar to the syenite blocks of\r\nNunklow, and the granite ones of Nonkreem, to be described hereafter,\r\nand which are undoubtedly due to the process of weathering. A great\r\nmass of flesh-coloured crystalline granite rises in the centre of the\r\nvalley, to the east of the road: it is fissured in various directions,\r\nand the surface scales concentrically; it is obscurely stratified in\r\nsome parts, and appears to be half granite and half gneiss in\r\nmineralogical character.\r\n\r\nWe twice visited a very remarkable hill, called Kollong, which rises as\r\na dome of granite 5,400 feet high, ten or twelve miles south-west of\r\nMyrung, and conspicuous from all directions. The path to it turns off\r\nfrom that to Nunklow, and strikes westerly along the shallow valley of\r\nMonai, in which is a village, and much rice and other cultivation. Near\r\nthis there is a large square stockade, formed of tall bamboos placed\r\nclose together, very like a New Zealand “Pa;” indeed, the whole country\r\nhereabouts much recalls the grassy clay hills, marshy valleys, and\r\nbushy ridges of the Bay of Islands.\r\n\r\nThe hills on either side are sometimes dotted with pinewoods, sometimes\r\nconical and bare, with small clumps of pines on the summit only; while\r\nin other places are broad tracts containing nothing but young trees,\r\nresembling plantations, but which, I am assured, are not planted; on\r\nthe other hand, however, Mr. Yule states, that the natives do plant\r\nfir-trees, especially near the iron forges, which give employment to\r\nall the people of Monai.\r\n\r\nAll the streams rise in flat marshy depressions amongst the hills with\r\nwhich the whole country is covered; and both these features, together\r\nwith the flat clay marshes into which the rivers expand, are very\r\nsuggestive of tidal action. Rock is hardly anywhere seen, except in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of Kollong, where are many scattered boulders of\r\nfine-grained gneiss, of which are made the broad stone slabs, placed as\r\nseats, and the other erections of this singular people. We repeatedly\r\nremarked cones of earth, clay, and pebbles, about twelve feet high,\r\nupon the hills, which appeared to be artificial, but of which the\r\nnatives could give no explanation. Wild apple and birch are common\r\ntrees, but there is little jungle, except in the hollows, and on the\r\nnorth slopes of the higher hills. Coarse long grass, with bushes of\r\nLabiate and Composite plants, are the prevalent features.\r\n\r\nKollong rock is a steep dome of red granite,[357] accessible from the\r\nnorth and east, but almost perpendicular to the southward, where the\r\nslope is 80° for 600 feet. The elevation is 400 feet above the mean\r\nlevel of the surrounding ridges, and 700 above the bottom of the\r\nvalleys. The south or steepest side is encumbered with enormous\r\ndetached blocks, while the north is clothed with a dense forest,\r\ncontaining red tree-rhododendrons and oaks; on its skirts grew a white\r\nbushy rhododendron, which we found nowhere else. The hard granite of\r\nthe top was covered with matted mosses, lichens, Lycopodiums, and\r\nferns, amongst which were many curious and beautiful airplants.[358]\r\n\r\n [357] This granite is highly crystalline, and does not scale or flake,\r\n nor is its surface polished.\r\n\r\n\r\n [358] _Eria, Cœlogyne_ (_Wallichii, maculata,_ and _elata_),\r\n _Cymbidium, Dendrobium, Sunipia_ some of them flowering profusely; and\r\n though freely exposed to the sun and wind, dews and frosts, rain and\r\n droughts, they were all fresh, bright, green and strong, under very\r\n different treatment from that to which they are exposed in the damp,\r\n unhealthy, steamy orchid-houses of our English gardens. A wild onion\r\n was most abundant all over the top of the hill, with _Hymenopogon,\r\n Vaccinium, Ophiopogon, Anisadenia, Commelyna, Didymocarpus, Remusatia,\r\n Hedychium,_ grass and small bamboos, and a good many other plants.\r\n Many of the lichens were of European kinds; but the mosses (except\r\n _Bryum argenteum_) and ferns were different. A small _Staphylinus,_\r\n which swarmed under the sods, was the only insect I remarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kollong rock]\r\n\r\nThe view from the top is very extensive to the northward, but not\r\nelsewhere: it commands the Assam valley and the Himalaya, and the\r\nbillowy range of undulating grassy Khasia mountains. Few houses were\r\nvisible, but the curling smoke from the valleys betrayed their\r\nlurking-places, whilst the tinkling sound of the hammers from the\r\ndistant forges on all sides was singularly musical and pleasing; they\r\nfell on the ear like “bells upon the wind,” each ring being exquisitely\r\nmelodious, and chiming harmoniously with the others. The solitude and\r\nbeauty of the scenery, and the emotions excited by the music of chimes,\r\ntended to tranquillise our minds, wearied by the fatigues of travel,\r\nand the excitement of pursuits that required unremitting attention; and\r\nwe rested for some time, our imaginations wandering to far-distant\r\nscenes, brought vividly to our minds by these familiar sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX\r\n\r\nView of Himalaya from the Khasia—Great masses of\r\nsnow—Chumulari—Donkia—Grasses—Nunklow—Assam valley and\r\nBurrampooter—Tropical forest—Borpanee—Rhododendrons—Wild\r\nelephants—Blocks of Syenite—Return to Churra—Coal—August\r\ntemperature—Leave for Chela—Jasper hill—Birds—_Arundina_—Habits of\r\nleaf-insects—Curious village—Houses—Canoes—Boga-panee\r\nriver—Jheels—Chattuc—Churra—Leave for Jyntea hills—Trading\r\nparties—Dried\r\nfish—Cherries—Cinnamon—Fraud—Pea-violet—Nonkreem—Sandstone—Pines—\r\nGranite boulders—Iron washing—Forges—Tanks—Siberian _Nymphæa_—Barren\r\ncountry—Pomrang—_Podostemon_—Patchouli plant—Mooshye—Enormous stone\r\nslabs—Pitcher-plant—Joowye cultivation and\r\nvegetation—_Hydropeltis_—Sulky hostess—Nurtiung—_Hamamelis\r\nchinensis_—Bor-panee river—Sacred grove and gigantic stone\r\nstructures—Altars—Pyramids, etc.—Origin of names—_Vanda\r\ncœrulea_—Collections—November vegetation—Geology of\r\nKhasia—Sandstone—Coal—Lime—Gneiss—Greenstone—Tidal action—Strike of\r\nrocks—Comparison with Rajmahal hills and the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snowy Himalaya was not visible during our first stay at Myrung,\r\nfrom the 5th to the 10th of July; but on three subsequent occasions,\r\nviz., 27th and 28th of July, 13th to 17th October, and 22nd to 25th\r\nOctober, we saw these magnificent mountains, and repeatedly took\r\nangular heights and bearings of the principal peaks. The range, as seen\r\nfrom the Khasia, does not form a continuous line of snowy mountains,\r\nbut the loftiest eminences are conspicuously grouped into masses, whose\r\nposition is probably between the great rivers which rise far beyond\r\nthem and flow through Bhotan. This arrangement indicates that relation\r\nof the rivers to the masses of snow, which I have dwelt upon in the\r\nAppendix; and further tends to prove that the snowy mountains, seen\r\nfrom the southward, are not on the axis of a mountain chain, and do not\r\neven indicate its position; but that they are lofty meridional spurs\r\nwhich, projecting southward, catch the moist vapours, become more\r\ndeeply snowed, and protect the dry loftier regions behind.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous group of snows seen from the Khasia bears N.N.E.\r\nfrom Myrung, and consists of three beautiful mountains with\r\nwide-spreading snowy shoulders. These are distant (reckoning from west\r\nto east) respectively 164, 170, and 172 miles from Myrung, and subtend\r\nangles of +0° 4′ 0″, –0° 1′ 30″, and –0° 2′ 28″.[359] From Nunklow (940\r\nfeet lower than Myrung) they appear higher, the western peak rising 14°\r\n35′ above the horizon; whilst from Moflong (32 miles further south, and\r\nelevation 6,062 feet) the same is sunk 2° below the horizon. My\r\ncomputations make this western mountain upwards of 24,000 feet high;\r\nbut according to Col. Wilcox’s angles, taken from the Assam valley, it\r\nis only 21,600, the others being respectively 20,720 and 21,475.\r\nCaptain Thuillier (the Deputy Surveyor General) agrees with me in\r\nconsidering that Colonel Wilcox’s altitudes are probably much\r\nunder-estimated, as those of other Himalayan peaks to the westward were\r\nby the old surveyors. It is further evident that these mountains have\r\n(as far as can be estimated by angles) fully 6–8000 feet of snow on\r\nthem, which would not be the case were the loftiest only 21,600 feet\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n [359] These angles were taken both at sunrise and sunset, and with an\r\n excellent theodolite, and were repeated after two considerable\r\n intervals. The telescopes were reversed after each observation, and\r\n every precaution used to insure accuracy; nevertheless the mean of one\r\n set of observations of angular height often varied 1 degree from that\r\n of another set. This is probably much due to atmospheric refraction,\r\n whose effect and amount it is impossible to estimate accurately in\r\n such cases. Here the objects are not only viewed through 160 miles of\r\n atmosphere, but through belts from between 6000 to 20,000 feet of\r\n vertical height, varying in humidity and transparency at different\r\n parts of the interval. If we divide this column of atmosphere into\r\n sections parallel to those of latitude, we have first a belt fifteen\r\n miles broad, hanging over the Khasia, 2000 to 4000 feet above the sea;\r\n beyond it, a second belt, seventy miles broad, hangs over the Assam\r\n valley, which is hardly 300 feet above the level of the sea; and\r\n thirdly, the northern part of the column, which reposes on 60 to 100\r\n miles of the Bhotan lower Himalaya: each of these belts has probably a\r\n different refractive power.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is singular, that to the eastward of this group, no snowy mountains\r\nare seen, and the lower Himalaya also dip suddenly. This depression is\r\nno doubt partly due to perspective; but as there is no such sudden\r\ndisappearance of the chain to the westward, where peaks are seen 35° to\r\nthe west of north, it is far more probable that the valley of the\r\nSoobansiri river, which rises in Tibet far behind these peaks, is broad\r\nand open; as is that of the Dihong, still farther east, which we have\r\nevery reason to believe is the Tibetan Yaru or Burrampooter.\r\n\r\nSupposing then the eastern group to indicate the mountain mass\r\nseparating the Soobansiri from the Monass river, no other mountains\r\nconspicuous for altitude or dimension rise between N.N.E. and north,\r\nwhere there is another immense group. This, though within 120 miles of\r\nMyrung, is below its horizon, and scarcely above that of Nunklow (which\r\nis still nearer to it), and cannot therefore attain any great\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nFar to the westward again, is a very lofty peaked mountain bearing\r\nN.N.W., which subtends an angle of –3′ 30″ from Myrung, and +6′ 0″ from\r\nNunklow. The angles of this seem to indicate its being either\r\nChumulari, or that great peak which I saw due east from Bbomtso top,\r\nand which I then estimated at ninety miles off and 23,500 feet high.\r\nFrom the Khasia angles, its latitude and longitude are 28° 6′ and 89°\r\n30′, its elevation 27,000 feet, and its distance from Myrung 200 miles.\r\nI need hardly add that neither the position nor the elevation computed\r\nfrom such data is worthy of confidence. Further still, to the extreme\r\nwest, is an immense low hog-backed mass of snow, with a small peak on\r\nit; this bears north-west, both from Myrung and Nunklow, subtending an\r\nangle of –25′ from the former, and –17′ from the latter station. It is\r\nin all probability Chumulari, 210 miles distant from Nunklow. Donkia,\r\nif seen, would be distant 230 miles from the same spot in the Khasia,\r\nand Kinchinjunga 260; possibly they are visible (by refraction) from\r\nChillong, though even further from it.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Myrung to Nunklow is ten miles, along an excellent\r\nroad. The descent is at first sudden, beyond which the country is\r\nundulating, interspersed with jungle (of low trees, chiefly oaks) and\r\nmarshes, with much rice cultivation. Grasses are exceedingly numerous;\r\nwe gathered fifty kinds, besides twenty _Cyperaceæ_: four were\r\ncultivated, namely sugar-cane, rice, _Coix,_ and maize. Most of the\r\nothers were not so well suited to pasturage as those of higher\r\nlocalities. Dwarf Phœnix palm occurs by the roadside at 5000 feet\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nGneiss (with garnets) highly inclined, was the prevalent rock (striking\r\nnorth-east), and scattered boulders of syenite became very frequent. In\r\none place the latter rock is seen bursting through the gneiss, which is\r\nslaty and very crystalline at the junction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bhotan Himalaya, Assam Valley, and Burrampooter\r\nRiver, from Nunklow, looking north.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNunklow is placed at the northern extremity of a broad spur that\r\nover-hangs the valley of the Burrampooter river, thirty miles distant.\r\nThe descent from it is very rapid, and beyond it none of the many spurs\r\nthrown out by the Khasia attain more than 1000 feet elevation; hence,\r\nthough the range does not present so abrupt a face to the Burrampooter\r\nas it does to the Jheels, Nunklow is considered as on the brink of its\r\nnorth slope. The elevation of the bungalow is 4,688 feet, and the\r\nclimate being hot, it swarms with mosquitos, fleas, and rats. It\r\ncommands a superb view to the north, of the Himalayan snows, of the\r\nBurrampooter, and intervening malarious Terai forest; and to the south,\r\nof the undulating Khasia, with Kollong rock bearing south-west. All the\r\nhills between this and Myrung look from Nunklow better wooded than they\r\ndo from Myrung, in consequence of the slopes exposed to the south being\r\nbare of forest.\r\n\r\nA thousand feet below the bungalow, a tropical forest begins, of figs,\r\nbirch, horse-chestnut, oak, nutmeg. _Cedrela, Engelhardtia,\r\nArtocarpeæ,_ and _Elæocarpus,_ in the gullies, and tall pines on the\r\ndry slopes, which are continued down to the very bottom of the valley\r\nin which flows the Bor-panee, a broad and rapid river that descends\r\nfrom Chillong, and winds round the base of the Nunklow spur. Many of\r\nthe pines are eighty feet high, and three or four in diameter, but none\r\nform gigantic trees. The quantity of balsams in the wet ravines is very\r\ngreat, and tree-ferns of several kinds are common.\r\n\r\nThe Bor-panee is about forty yards wide, and is spanned by an elegant\r\niron suspension-bridge, that is clamped to the gneiss rock (strike\r\nnorth-east, dip north-west) on either bank; beneath is a series of\r\ncascades, none high, but all of great beauty from the broken masses of\r\nrocks and picturesque scenery on either side. We frequently botanised\r\nup and down the river with great success: many curious plants grow on\r\nits stony and rocky banks; and amongst them _Rhododendron formosum_ at\r\nthe low elevation of 2000 feet. A most splendid fern, _Dipteris\r\nWallichii,_ is abundant, with the dwarf Phœnix palm and _Cycas\r\npectinata._ Wild animals are very abundant here, though extremely rare\r\non the higher part of the Khasia range; tigers, however, and bears,\r\nascend to Nunklow. We saw troops of wild dogs (“Kuleam,” Khas.), deer,\r\nand immense quantities of the droppings of the wild elephant; an animal\r\nconsidered in Assam dangerous to meet, whereas in other parts of India\r\nit is not dreaded till provoked. There is, however, no quadruped that\r\nvaries more in its native state than this: the Ceylon kind differs from\r\nthe Indian in the larger size and short tusks, and an experienced judge\r\nat Calcutta will tell at once whether the newly caught elephant is from\r\nAssam, Silhet, Cuttack, Nepal, or Chittagong. Some of the differences,\r\nin size, roundness of shoulders and back, quantity of hair, length of\r\nlimb, and shape of head, are very marked; and their dispositions are\r\nequally various.\r\n\r\nThe lowest rocks seen are at a considerable distance down the\r\nBor-panee; they are friable sandstones that strike uniformly with the\r\ngneiss. From the bridge upwards the rocks are all gneiss, alternating\r\nwith chert and quartz. The Nunklow spur is covered with enormous\r\nrounded blocks of syenite, reposing on clay or on one another. These do\r\nnot descend the hill, and are the remains of an extensive formation\r\nwhich we could only find _in situ_ at one spot on the road to Myrung\r\n(see earlier), but which must have been of immense thickness.[360] One\r\nblock within ten yards of the bungalow door was fifteen feet long, six\r\nhigh, and eight broad; it appeared half buried, and was rapidly\r\ndecomposing from the action of the rain. Close by, to the westward, in\r\nwalking amongst the masses we were reminded of a moraine of most\r\ngigantic sized blocks; one which I measured was forty feet long and\r\neleven above the ground; its edges were rounded, and its surface flaked\r\noff in pieces a foot broad and a quarter of an inch thick. Trees and\r\nbrushwood often conceal the spaces between these fragments, and afford\r\ndens for bears and leopards, into which man cannot follow them.\r\n\r\n [360] The tendency of many volcanic rocks to decompose in spheres is\r\n very well known: it is conspicuous in the black basalts north of\r\n Edinburgh, but I do not know any instance equal to this of Nunklow,\r\n for the extent of decomposition and dimensions of the resulting\r\n spheres.\r\n\r\n\r\nSitting in the cool evenings on one of these great blocks, and watching\r\nthe Himalayan glaciers glowing with the rays of sunset, appearing to\r\nchange in form and dimensions with the falling shadows, it was\r\nimpossible to refrain from speculating on the possibility of these\r\ngreat boulders heaped on the Himalayan-ward face of the Khasia range,\r\nhaving been transported hither by ice at some former period; especially\r\nas the Mont Blanc granite, in crossing the lake of Geneva to the Jura,\r\nmust have performed a hardly less wonderful ice journey: but this\r\nhypothesis is clearly untenable; and unparalleled in our experience as\r\nthe results appear, if attributed to denudation and weathering alone,\r\nwe are yet compelled to refer them to these causes. The further we\r\ntravel, and the longer we study, the more positive becomes the\r\nconviction that the part played by these great agents in sculpturing\r\nthe surface of our planet, is as yet but half recognised.\r\n\r\nWe returned on the 7th of August to Churra, where we employed ourselves\r\nduring the rest of the month in collecting and studying the plants of\r\nthe neighbourhood. We hired a large and good bungalow, in which three\r\nimmense coal fires[361] were kept up for drying plants and\r\n\r\npapers, and fifteen men were always employed, some in changing, and\r\nsome in collecting, from morning till night. The coal was procured\r\nwithin a mile of our door, and cost about six shillings a month; it was\r\nof the finest quality, and gave great heat and few ashes. Torrents of\r\nrain descended almost daily, twelve inches in as many hours being\r\nfrequently registered; and we remarked that it was impossible to judge\r\nof the quantity by estimation, an apparent deluge sometimes proving\r\nmuch less in amount than much lighter but steadier falls; hence the\r\ngreatest fall is probably that in which the drops are moderately large;\r\nvery close together, and which pass through a saturated atmosphere. The\r\ntemperature of the rain here and elsewhere in India was always a degree\r\nor two below that of the air.\r\n\r\n [361] This coal is excellent for many purposes. We found it generally\r\n used by the Assam steamers, and were informed on board that in which\r\n we traversed the Sunderbunds, some months afterwards, that her\r\n furnaces consumed 729 lbs. per hour; whereas the consumption of\r\n English coal was 800 lbs., of Burdwan coal 8401bs., and of Assam 900\r\n lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the temperature in August rose to 75°, we never felt a fire\r\noppressive, owing to the constant damp, and absence of sun. The latter,\r\nwhen it broke through the clouds, shone powerfully, raising the\r\nthermometer 20° and 30° in as many minutes. On such occasions, hot\r\nblasts of damp wind ascend the valleys, and impinge suddenly against\r\ndifferent houses on the flat, giving rise to extraordinary differences\r\nbetween the mean daily temperatures of places not half a mile apart.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September we started for the village of Chela, which lies\r\nwest from Churra, at the embouchure of the Boga-panee on the Jheels.\r\nThe path runs by Mamloo, and down the spur to the Jasper hill (see p.\r\n280): the vegetation all along is very tropical, and pepper, ginger,\r\nmaize, and Betel palm, are cultivated around small cottages, which are\r\nonly distinguishable in the forest by their yellow thatch of dry\r\n_Calamus_ (Rattan) leaves. From Jasper hill a very steep ridge leads to\r\nanother, called Lisouplang, which is hardly so high as Mamloo; the\r\nrocks are the same sandstone, with fragments of coal, and remains of\r\nthe limestone formation capping it.\r\n\r\nHot gusts of wind blow up the valleys, alternating with clouds and\r\nmists, and it is curious to watch the effects of the latter in stilling\r\nthe voices of insects (Cicadas) and birds. Common crows and vultures\r\nhaunt the villages, but these, and all other large birds, are very rare\r\nin the Khasia. A very few hawks are occasionally seen, also sparrows\r\nand kingfishers, and I once heard a cuckoo; pheasants are sometimes\r\nshot, but we never saw any. Kites become numerous after the rains, and\r\nare regarded as a sign of their cessation. More remarkable than the\r\nrarity of birds is the absence of all animals except domestic rats, as\r\na more suitable country for hares and rabbits could not be found.\r\nReptiles, and especially Colubridæ, are very common in the Khasia\r\nmountains, and I procured sixteen species and many specimens. The\r\nnatives repeatedly assured us that these were all harmless, and Dr.\r\nGray, who has kindly examined all my snakes, informs me of the\r\nremarkable fact (alluded to in a note in p. 25), that whereas none of\r\nthese are poisonous, four out of the eleven species which I found in\r\nSikkim are so. One of the Khasia blind-worms (a new species) belongs to\r\na truly American genus (_Ophisaurus_), a fact as important as is that\r\nof the Sikkim skink and _Agama_ being also American forms.\r\n\r\n_Arundina,_ a beautiful purple grassy-leaved orchid, was abundantly in\r\nflower on the hill-top, and the great white swallow-tailed moth\r\n(_Saturnia Atlas_) was extremely common, with tropical butterflies and\r\nother insects. The curious leaf-insect (_Mantis_) was very abundant on\r\nthe orange trees, on the leaves of which the natives believe it to\r\nfeed; nor indeed could we persuade some of our friends that its thin\r\nsharp jaws are unsuited for masticating leaves, and that these and its\r\nprehensile feet indicate its predacious nature: added to which, its\r\nsingular resemblance to a leaf is no less a provision against its being\r\ndiscovered by its enemies, than an aid in deceiving its prey.\r\n\r\nWe descended rapidly for many miles through beautiful rocky woods, with\r\nvillages nestling amongst groves of banana and trellised climbers; and\r\nfrom the brow of a hill looked down upon a slope covered with\r\nvegetation and huts, which formed the mart of Chela, and below which\r\nthe Boga-panee flowed in a deep gorge. The view was a very striking\r\none: owing to the steepness of the valley below our feet, the roofs\r\nalone of the cottages were visible, from which ascended the sounds and\r\nsmells of a dense native population, and to which there appeared to be\r\nno way of descending. The opposite side rose precipitously in lofty\r\ntable-topped mountains, and the river was studded with canoes.\r\n\r\nThe descent was fully 800 feet, on a slope averaging 25° to 35°. The\r\ncottages were placed close together, each within a little bamboo\r\nenclosure, eight to ten yards deep; and no two were on the same level.\r\nEach was built against a perpendicular wall which supported a cutting\r\nin the bank behind; and a similar wall descended in front of it,\r\nforming the back of the compartment in which the cottage next below it\r\nwas erected. The houses were often raised on platforms, and some had\r\nbalconies in front, which overhung the cottage below. All were mere\r\nhovels of wattle or mud, with very high-pitched roofs: stone tanks\r\nresembling fonts, urns, coffins, and sarcophagi, were placed near the\r\nbetter houses, and blocks of stone were scattered everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe descended from hovel to hovel, alternately along the gravelled flat\r\nof each enclosure, and perpendicularly down steps cut in the sandstone\r\nor let into the walls. I counted 800 houses from the river, and there\r\nmust be many more: the inhabitants are Bengalees and Khasias, and\r\nperhaps amount to 3000 or 4000; but this is a very vague estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chela village]\r\n\r\nWe lodged in a curious house, consisting of one apartment, twenty feet\r\nlong, and five high, raised thirty feet upon bamboos: the walls were of\r\nplatted bamboo matting, fastened to strong wooden beams, and one side\r\nopened on a balcony that overhung the river. The entrance was an oval\r\naperture reached by a ladder, and closed by folding-doors that turned\r\non wooden pivots. The roof was supported by tressels of great\r\nthickness, and like the rest of the woodwork, was morticed, no nails\r\nbeing used throughout the building. The floor was of split bamboos laid\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\nWe ascended the Boga-panee in canoes, each formed of a hollowed trunk\r\nfifty feet long and four broad; we could not, however, proceed far, on\r\naccount of the rapids. The rocks in its bed are limestone, but a great\r\nbluff cliff of sandy conglomerate (strike east-south-east and dip\r\nsouth-south-west 70°), several hundred feet high, rises on the east\r\nbank close above the village, above which occurs amygdaloidal basalt.\r\nThe pebbles in the river (which was seventy yards broad, and turbid)\r\nwere of slate, basalt, sandstone, and syenite: on the opposite bank\r\nwere sandstones over-lain by limestone, both dipping to the southward.\r\n\r\nBeautiful palms, especially _Caryota urens_ (by far the handsomest in\r\nIndia), and groves of betel-nut bordered the river, with oranges,\r\nlemons, and citrons; intermixed with feathery bamboos,\r\nhorizontally-branched acacias, oaks, with pale red young leaves, and\r\ndeep green foliaged figs. Prickly rattans and _Plectocomia_ climbed\r\namongst these, their enormous plumes of foliage upborne by the matted\r\nbranches of the trees, and their arrowy tops shooting high above the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAfter staying three days at Chela, we descended the stream in canoes,\r\nshooting over pebbly rapids, and amongst rocks of limestone, water-worn\r\ninto fantastic shapes, till we at last found ourselves gliding gently\r\nalong the still canals of the Jheels. Many of these rapids are so far\r\nartificial, that they are enclosed by gravel banks, six feet high,\r\nwhich, by confining the waters, give them depth; but, Chela being\r\nhardly above the level of the sea, their fall is very trifling. We\r\nproceeded across the Jheels[362] to Chattuc, and then north again to\r\nPundua, and so to Churra.\r\n\r\n [362] The common water-plants of the Jheels are _Vallisneria serrata,\r\n Damasonium,_ 2 _Myriophylla,_ 2 _Villarsiæ, Trapa,_ blue, white,\r\n purple and scarlet water-lilies, _Hydrilla, Utricularia, Limnophila,\r\n Azolla, Salvinia, Ceratopteris,_ and floating grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving pretty well exhausted the botany of Churra, Dr. Thomson and I\r\nstarted on the 13th of September for the eastern part of the Khasia and\r\nJyntea mountains. On the Kala-panee road,[363] which we followed, we\r\npassed crowds of market people, laden with dried fish in a half-putrid\r\nstate, which scented the air for many yards: they were chiefly carp,\r\ncaught and dried at the foot of the hills. Large parties were bringing\r\ndown baskets of bird-cherries, cinnamon-bark, iron, pine planks,\r\nfire-wood, and potatoes. Of these, the bird-cherries (like damsons) are\r\nmade into an excellent preserve by the English residents, who also make\r\ncapital cherry-brandy of them: the trade in cinnamon is of recent\r\nintroduction, and is much encouraged by the Inglis family, to whose\r\nexertions these people are so greatly indebted; the cinnamon is the\r\npeeled bark of a small species of _Cinnamomum_ allied to that of\r\nCeylon, and though inferior in flavour and mucilaginous (like cassia),\r\nfinds a ready market at Calcutta. It has been used to adulterate the\r\nCeylon cinnamon; and an extensive fraud was attempted by some Europeans\r\nat Calcutta, who sent boxes of this, with a top layer of the genuine,\r\nto England. The smell of the cinnamon loads was as fragrant as that of\r\nthe fish was offensive.\r\n\r\n [363] The Pea-violet (_Crotalaria occulta_) was very common by the\r\n road-side, and smelt deliciously of violets: the English name suggests\r\n the appearance of the flower, for which and for its fragrance it is\r\n well worth cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road from Kala-panee bungalow strikes off north-easterly, and\r\nrounds the head of the deep valley to the east of Churra; it then\r\ncrosses the head-waters of the Kala-panee river, still a clear stream,\r\nthe bed of which is comparatively superficial: the rocks consist of a\r\nlittle basalt and much sandstone, striking east by north, and dipping\r\nnorth by west. The Boga-panee is next reached, flowing in a shallow\r\nvalley, about 200 feet below the general level of the hills, which are\r\ngrassy and treeless. The river[364] is thirty yards across, shallow and\r\nturbid; its bed is granite, and beyond it scattered stunted pines are\r\nmet with; a tree which seems to avoid the sandstone. In the evening we\r\narrived at Nonkreem, a large village in a broad marshy valley, where we\r\nprocured accommodation with some difficulty, the people being by no\r\nmeans civil, and the Rajah, Sing Manuk, holding himself independent of\r\nthe British Government.\r\n\r\n [364] The fall of this river, between this elevation (which may be\r\n considered that of its source) and Chela, is about 5,500 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtmospheric denudation and weathering have produced remarkable effects\r\non the lower part of the Nonkreem valley, which is blocked up by a\r\npine-crested hill, 200 feet high, entirely formed of round blocks of\r\ngranite, heaped up so as to resemble an old moraine; but like the\r\nNunklow boulders, these are not arranged as if by glacial action. The\r\ngranite is micaceous, and usually very soft, decomposing into a coarse\r\nreddish sand, that colours the Boga-panee. To procure the iron-sand,\r\nwhich is disseminated through it, the natives conduct water over the\r\nbeds of granite sand, and as the lighter particles are washed away, the\r\nremainder is removed to troughs, where the separation of the ore is\r\ncompleted. The smelting is very rudely carried on in charcoal fires,\r\nblown by enormous double-action bellows, worked by two persons, who\r\nstand on the machine, raising the flaps with their hands, and expanding\r\nthem with their feet, as shown in the cut at p. 312. There is neither\r\nfurnace nor flux used in the reduction. The fire is kindled on one aide\r\nof an upright stone (like the head-stone of a grave), with a small\r\narched hole close to the ground: near this hole the bellows are\r\nsuspended; and a bamboo tube from each of its compartments, meets in a\r\nlarger one, by which the draught is directed under the hole in the\r\nstone to the fire. The ore is run into lumps as large as two fists,\r\nwith a rugged surface: these lumps are afterwards cleft nearly in two,\r\nto show their purity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nonkreem village]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scenery about Nonkreem village is extremely picturesque, and we\r\nprocured many good plants on the rocks, which were covered with the\r\npurple-flowered Orchid, _Cœlogyne Wallichii._ The country is everywhere\r\nintersected with trenches for iron-washing, and some large marshes were\r\ndammed up for the same purpose: in these we found some beautiful\r\nbalsams, _Hypericum_ and _Parnassia_; also a diminutive water-lily, the\r\nflower of which is no larger than a half-crown; it proves to be the\r\n_Nymphæa pygmæa_ of China and Siberia—a remarkable fact in the\r\ngeographical distribution of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bellows]\r\n\r\nFrom Nonkreem we proceeded easterly to Pomrang, leaving Chillong hill\r\non the north, and again crossing the Bega-panee, beyond which the\r\nsandstone appeared (strike north-east and dip north-west 60°); the soil\r\nwas poor in the extreme; not an inhabitant or tree was to be seen\r\nthroughout the grassy landscape, and hardly a bush, save an occasional\r\nrhododendron, dwarf oak, or _Pieris,_ barely a few inches high.\r\n\r\nAt Pomrang we took up our quarters in an excellent empty bungalow,\r\nbuilt by Mr. Stainforth (Judge of Silhet), who kindly allowed us the\r\nuse of it. Its elevation was 5,143 feet, and it occupied the eastern\r\nextremity of a lofty spur that overhangs the deep fir-clad valley of\r\nthe Oongkot, dividing Khasia from Jyntea. The climate of Pomrang is so\r\nmuch cooler and less rainy than at Churra, that this place is more\r\neligible for a station; but the soil is quite impracticable, there is\r\nan occasional scarcity of water, the pasture is wholly unsuited for\r\ncattle or sheep, and the distance from the plains is too great.\r\n\r\nA beautiful view extends eastwards to the low Jyntea hills, backed by\r\nthe blue mountains of Cachar, over the deep valley in front; to the\r\nnorthward, a few peaks of the Himalaya are seen, and westward is\r\nChillong. We staid here till the 23rd September, and then proceeded\r\nsouth-eastward to Mooshye. The path descends into the valley of the\r\nOongkot, passing the village of Pomrang, and then through woods of\r\npine, _Gordonia,_ and oak, the latter closely resembling the English,\r\nand infested with galls. The slopes are extensively cultivated with\r\nblack awnless unirrigated rice, and poor crops of _Coix,_ protected\r\nfrom the birds by scarecrows of lines stretched across the fields,\r\nbearing tassels and tufts of fern, shaken by boys. This fern proved to\r\nbe a very curious and interesting genus, which is only known to occur\r\nelsewhere at Hong-Kong in China, and has been called _Bowringia,_ after\r\nthe eminent Dr. Bowring.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the river[365] twice, proceeding south-west to Mooshye, a\r\nvillage placed on an isolated, flat-topped, and very steep-sided hill,\r\n4,863 feet above the sea, and perhaps 3,500 above the Oongkot, which\r\nwinds round its base. A very steep path led up slate rocks to the top\r\n(which was of sandstone), where there is a stockaded guard-house, once\r\noccupied by British troops, of which we took possession. A Labiate\r\nplant (_Mesona Wallichiana_) grew on the ascent, whose bruised leaves\r\nsmelt as strongly of patchouli, as do those of the plant producing that\r\nperfume, to which it is closely allied. The _Pogostemon Patchouli_ has\r\nbeen said to occur in these parts of India, but we never met with it,\r\nand doubt the accuracy of the statement. It is a native of the Malay\r\npeninsula, whence the leaves are imported into Bengal, and so to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n [365] _Podostemom_ grew on the stones at the bottom: it is a\r\n remarkable waterplant, resembling a liver-wort in its mode of growth.\r\n Several species occur at different elevations in the Khasia, and\r\n appear only in autumn, when they often carpet the bottom of the\r\n streams with green. In spring and summer no traces of them are seen;\r\n and it is difficult to conceive what becomes of the seeds in the\r\n interval, and how these, which are well known, and have no apparent\r\n provision for the purpose, attach themselves to the smooth rocks at\r\n the bottom of the torrents. All the kinds flower and ripen their seeds\r\n under water; the stamens and pistil being protected by the closed\r\n flower from the wet. This genus does not inhabit the Sikkim rivers,\r\n probably owing to the great changes of temperature to which these are\r\n subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summit commands a fine view northward of some Himalayan peaks, and\r\nsouthwards of the broad valley of the Oongkot, which is level, and\r\nbounded by steep and precipitous hills, with flat tops. On the 25th we\r\nleft Mooshye for Amwee in Jyntea, which lies to the south-east. We\r\ndescended by steps cut in the sandstone, and fording the Oongkot,\r\nclimbed the hills on its east side, along the grassy tops of which we\r\ncontinued, at an elevation of 4000 feet. Marshy flats intersect the\r\nhills, to which wild elephants sometimes ascend, doing much damage to\r\nthe rice crops. We crossed a stream by a bridge formed of one gigantic\r\nblock of sandstone, 20 feet long, close to the village, which is a\r\nwretched one, and is considered unhealthy: it stands on the high road\r\nfrom Jynteapore (at the foot of the hills to the southward) to Assam:\r\nthe only road that crosses the mountains east of that from Churra to\r\nNunklow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old bridge at Amwee]\r\n\r\nThough so much lower, this country, from the barrenness of the soil, is\r\nmore thinly inhabited than the Khasia. The pitcher-plant (_Nepenthes_)\r\ngrows on stony and grassy hills about Amwee, and crawls along the\r\nground; its pitchers seldom contain insects in the wild state, nor can\r\nwe suggest any special function for the wonderful organ it possesses.\r\n\r\nAbout eight miles south of the village is a stream, crossed by a\r\nbridge, half of which is formed of slabs of stone (of which one is\r\ntwenty-one feet long, seven broad, and two feet three and a half inches\r\nthick), supported on piers, and the rest is a well turned arch, such as\r\nI have not seen elsewhere among the hill tribes of India. It is fast\r\ncrumbling away, and is covered with tropical plants, and a beautiful\r\nwhite-flowered orchis[366] grew in the mossy crevices of its stones.\r\n\r\n [366] _Diplomeris; Apostasia_ also grew in this gulley, with a small\r\n _Arundina,_ some beautiful species of _Sonerila,_ and _Argostemma._\r\n The neighbourhood was very rich in plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Amwee our route lay north-east across the Jyntea hills to Joowye,\r\nthe hill-capital of the district. The path gradually ascended, dipping\r\ninto valleys scooped out in the horizontal sandstone down to the\r\nbasalt; and boulders of the same rock were scattered about. Fields of\r\nrice occupy the bottoms of these valleys, in which were placed gigantic\r\nimages of men, dressed in rags, and armed with bows and arrows, to\r\nscare away the wild elephants! Slate rocks succeed the sandstone\r\n(strike north-east, dip north-west), and with them pines and birch\r\nappear, clothing the deep flanks of the Mintadoong valley, which we\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Joowye is extremely beautiful: it occupies the broken\r\nwooded slope of a large open flat valley, dotted with pines; and\r\nconsists of an immense number of low thatched cottages, scattered\r\namongst groves of bamboo, and fields of plantain, tobacco, yams,\r\nsugar-cane, maize, and rice, surrounded by hedges of bamboo,\r\n_Colquhounia,_ and _Erythrina._ Narrow steep lanes lead amongst these,\r\nshaded with oak, birch, _Podocarpus,_ Camellia, and _Araliaceæ_; the\r\nlarger trees being covered with orchids, climbing palms, _Pothos,\r\nScindapsus,_ pepper, and _Gnetum_; while masses of beautiful red and\r\nviolet balsams grew under every hedge and rock. The latter was of\r\nsandstone, overlying highly inclined schists, and afforded magnificent\r\nblocks for the natives to rear on end, or make seats of. Some erect\r\nstones on a hill at the entrance are immensely large, and surround a\r\nclump of fine fig and banyan trees.[367]\r\n\r\n [367] In some tanks we found _Hydropeltis,_ an American and Australian\r\n plant allied to _Nymphæa._ Mr. Griffith first detected it here, and\r\n afterwards in Bhotan, these being the only known habitats for it in\r\n the Old World. It grows with _Typha, Acorus Calamus_ (sweet flag),\r\n _Vallisneria, Potamogeton, Sparganium,_ and other European\r\n water-plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe procured a good house after many delays, for the people were far\r\nfrom obliging; it was a clean, very long cottage, with low thatched\r\neaves almost touching the ground, and was surrounded by a high bamboo\r\npaling that enclosed out-houses built on a well-swept floor of beaten\r\nearth. Within, the woodwork was carved in curious patterns, and was\r\nparticularly well fitted. The old lady to whom it belonged got tired of\r\nus before two days were over, and first tried to smoke us out by a\r\nlarge fire of green wood at that end of the cottage which she retained;\r\nand afterwards by inviting guests to a supper, with whom she kept up a\r\nracket all night. Her son, a tall, sulky fellow, came to receive the\r\nusual gratuity on our departure, which we made large to show we bore no\r\nill-will: he, however, behaved so scornfully, pretending to despise it,\r\nthat I had no choice but to pocket it again; a proceeding which was\r\nreceived with shouts of laughter, at his expense, from a large crowd of\r\nbystanders.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of September we proceeded north-east from Joowye to\r\nNurtiung, crossing the watershed of the Jyntea range, which is\r\ngranitic, and scarcely raised above the mean level of the hills; it is\r\nabout 4,500 feet elevation. To the north the descent is at first rather\r\nabrupt for 500 feet, to a considerable stream, beyond which is the\r\nvillage of Nurtiung. The country gradually declines hence to the\r\nnorth-east, in grassy hills; which to the east become higher and more\r\nwooded: to the west the Khasia are seen, and several Himalayan peaks to\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to the village from the river is by steps cut in a narrow\r\ncleft of the schist rocks, to a flat, elevated 4,178 feet above the\r\nsea: we here procured a cottage, and found the people remarkably civil.\r\nThe general appearance is the same as at Joowye, but there are here\r\nextensive and very unhealthy marshes, whose evil effects we\r\nexperienced, in having the misfortune to lose one of our servants by\r\nfever. Except pines, there are few large trees; but the quantity of\r\nspecies of perennial woody plants contributing to form the jungles is\r\nquite extraordinary: I enumerated 140, of which 60 were trees or large\r\nshrubs above twenty feet high. One of these was the _Hamamelis\r\nchinensis,_ a plant hitherto only known as a native of China. This, the\r\n_Bowringia,_ and the little _Nymphæa,_ are three out of many remarkable\r\ninstances of our approach to the eastern Asiatic flora.\r\n\r\nFrom Nurtiung we walked to the Bor-panee river, sixteen or twenty miles\r\nto the north-east (not the river of that name below Nunklow), returning\r\nthe same night; a most fatiguing journey in so hot and damp a climate.\r\nThe path lay for the greatest part of the way over grassy hills of\r\nmica-schist, with boulders of granite, and afterwards of syenite, like\r\nthose of Nunklow. The descent to the river is through noble woods of\r\nspreading oaks,[368] chesnuts, magnolias, and tall pines: the\r\nvegetation is very tropical, and with the exception of there being no\r\nsal, it resembles that of the dry hills of the Sikkim Terai. The\r\nBor-panee is forty yards broad, and turbid; its bed, which is of\r\nbasalt, is 2,454 feet above the sea: it is crossed by a raft pulled to\r\nand fro by canes.\r\n\r\n [368] We collected upwards of fifteen kinds of oak and chesnut in\r\n these and the Khasia mountains; many are magnificent trees, with\r\n excellent wood, while others are inferior as timber.\r\n\r\n\r\nNurtiung contains a most remarkable collection of those sepulchral and\r\nother monuments, which form so curious a feature in the scenery of\r\nthese mountains and in the habits of their savage population. They are\r\nall placed in a fine grove of trees, occupying a hollow; where several\r\nacres are covered with gigantic, generally circular, slabs of stone,\r\nfrom ten to twenty-five feet broad, supported five feet above the\r\nground upon other blocks. For the most part they are buried in\r\nbrushwood of nettles and shrubs, but in one place there is an open area\r\nof fifty yards encircled by them, each with a gigantic headstone behind\r\nit. Of the latter the tallest was nearly thirty feet high, six broad,\r\nand two feet eight inches in thickness, and must have been sunk at\r\nleast five feet, and perhaps much more, in the ground. The flat slabs\r\nwere generally of slate or hornstone; but many of them, and all the\r\nlarger ones, were of syenitic granite, split by heat and cold water\r\nwith great art. They are erected by dint of sheer brute strength, the\r\nlever being the only aid. Large blocks of syenite were scattered\r\namongst these wonderful erections.\r\n\r\nSplendid trees of _Bombax,_ fig and banyan, overshadowed them: the\r\nlargest banyan had a trunk five feet in diameter, clear of the\r\nbuttresses, and numerous small trees of _Celtic_ grew out of it, and an\r\nimmense flowering tuft of _Vanda cærulea_ (the rarest and most\r\nbeautiful of Indian orchids) flourished on one of its limbs. A small\r\nplantain with austere woolly scarlet fruit, bearing ripe seeds, was\r\nplanted in this sacred grove, where trees of the most tropical genera\r\ngrew mixed with the pine, birch, _Myrica,_ and _Viburnum._\r\n\r\nThe Nurtiung Stonehenge is no doubt in part religious, as the grove\r\nsuggests, and also designed for cremation, the bodies being burnt on\r\nthe altars. In the Khasia these upright stones are generally raised\r\nsimply as memorials of great events, or of men whose ashes are not\r\nnecessarily, though frequently, buried or deposited in hollow stone\r\nsarcophagi near them, and sometimes in an urn placed inside a\r\nsarcophagus, or under horizontal slabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stones at Nurtiung]\r\n\r\nThe usual arrangement is a row of five, seven, or more erect oblong\r\nblocks with round heads (the highest being placed in the middle), on\r\nwhich are often wooden discs and cones: more rarely pyramids are built.\r\nBroad slabs for seats are also common by the wayside. Mr. Yule, who\r\nfirst drew attention to these monuments, mentions one thirty-two feet\r\nby fifteen, and two in thickness; and states that the sarcophagi\r\n(which, however, are rare) formed of four slabs, resemble a drawing in\r\nBell’s Circassia, and descriptions in Irby and Mangles’ Travels in\r\nSyria. He adds that many villages derive their names from these stones,\r\n“mau” signifying “stone:” thus “Mausmai” is “the stone of oath,”\r\nbecause, as his native informant said, “there was war between Churra\r\nand Mausmai, and when they made peace, they swore to it, and placed a\r\nstone as a witness;” forcibly recalling the stone Jacob set up for a\r\npillar, and other passages in the old Testament: “Mamloo” is “the stone\r\nof salt,” eating salt from a sword’s point being the Khasia form of\r\noath: “Mauflong” is “the grassy stone,” etc.[369] Returning from this\r\ngrove, we crossed a stream by a single squared block, twenty-eight feet\r\nlong, five broad, and two thick, of gray syenitic granite with large\r\ncrystals of felspar.\r\n\r\n [369] Notes on the Khasia mountains and people; by Lieutenant H. Yule,\r\n Bengal Engineers. Analogous combinations occur in the south of England\r\n and in Brittany, etc., where similar structures are found. Thus _mæn,\r\n man,_ or _men_ is the so-called Druidical name for a stony, whence\r\n _Pen-mæn-mawr,_ for “the hill of the big stone,” _Mæn-hayr,_ for the\r\n standing stones of Brittany, and _Dol-men,_ “the table-stone,” for a\r\n cromlech.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Nurtiung on the 4th of October, and walked to Pomrang, a very\r\nlong and fatiguing day’s work. The route descends north-west of the\r\nvillage, and turns due east along bare grassy hills of mica-schist and\r\nslate (strike east and west, and dip north). Near the village of Lernai\r\noak woods are passed, in which _Vanda cœrulea_ grows in profusion,\r\nwaving its panicles of azure flowers in the wind. As this beautiful\r\norchid is at present attracting great attention, from its high price,\r\nbeauty, and difficulty of culture, I shall point out how totally at\r\nvariance with its native habits, is the cultivation thought necessary\r\nfor it in England.[370] The dry grassy hills which it inhabits are\r\nelevated 3000 to 4000 feet: the trees are small, gnarled, and very\r\nsparingly leafy, so that the Vanda which grows on their limbs is fully\r\nexposed to sun, rain, and wind. There is no moss or lichen on the\r\nbranches with the Vanda, whose roots sprawl over the dry rough bark.\r\nThe atmosphere is on the whole humid, and extremely so during the\r\nrains; but there is no damp heat, or stagnation of the air, and at the\r\nflowering season the temperature ranges between 60° and 80°, there is\r\nmuch sunshine, and both air and bark are dry during the day: in July\r\nand August, during the rains, the temperature is a little higher than\r\nabove, but in winter it falls much lower, and hoar-frost forms on the\r\nground. Now this winter’s cold, summer’s heat, and autumn’s drought,\r\nand above all, this constant free exposure to fresh air and the winds\r\nof heaven, are what of all things we avoid exposing our orchids to in\r\nEngland. It is under these conditions, however, that all the finer\r\nIndian _Orchideæ,_ grow, of which we found _Dendrobium Farmeri,\r\nDalhousianum, Devonianum,_ etc., with _Vanda cœrulea_; whilst the most\r\nbeautiful species of _Cœlogyne, Cymbidium, Bolbophyllum,_ and\r\n_Cypripedium,_ inhabit cool climates at elevations above 4000 feet in\r\nKhasia, and as high as 6000 to 7000 in Sikkim.\r\n\r\n [370] We collected seven men’s loads of this superb plant for the\r\n Royal Gardens at Kew; but owing to unavoidable accidents and\r\n difficulties, few specimens reached England alive. A gentleman who\r\n sent his gardener with us to be shown the locality, was more\r\n successful: he sent one man’s load to England on commission, and\r\n though it arrived in a very poor state, it sold for 300_l_, the\r\n individual plants fetching prices varying from 3_l_ to 10_l._ Had all\r\n arrived alive, they would have cleared 1000 pounds. An active\r\n collector, with the facilities I possessed, might easily clear from\r\n 2000_l_ to 3000_l_, in one season, by the sale of Khasia orchids.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day we turned out our Vanda to dress the specimens for\r\ntravelling, and preserve the flowers for botanical purposes. Of the\r\nlatter we had 360 panicles, each composed of from six to twenty-one\r\nbroad pale-blue tesselated flowers, three and a half to four inches\r\nacross and they formed three piles on the floor of the verandah, each a\r\nyard high: what would we not have given to have been able to transport\r\na single panicle to a Chiswick fête!\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October we sent twenty-four strong mountaineers to\r\nChurra, laden with the collections of the previous month; whilst we\r\nreturned to Nonkreem, and crossing the shoulder of Chillong, passed\r\nthrough the village of Moleem in a north-west direction to the Syong\r\nbungalow. From this we again crossed the range to Nunklow and the\r\nBor-panee, and returned by Moflong and the Kala-panee to Churra during\r\nthe latter part of the month.\r\n\r\nIn November the vegetation above 4000 feet turns wintry and brown, the\r\nweather becomes chilly, and though the cold is never great, hoar-frost\r\nforms at Churra, and water freezes at Moflong. We prepared to leave as\r\nthese signs of winter advanced: we had collected upwards of 2,500\r\nspecies, and for the last few weeks all our diligence, and that of our\r\ncollectors, had failed to be rewarded by a single novelty. We however\r\nprocured many species in fruit, and made a collection of upwards of 300\r\nkinds of woods, many of very curious structure. As, however, we\r\nprojected a trip to Cachar before quitting the neighbourhood, we\r\nretained our collectors, giving orders for them to meet us at Chattuc,\r\non our way down the Soormah in December, with their collections, which\r\namounted to 200 men’s loads, and for the conveyance of which to\r\nCalcutta, Mr. Inglis procured us boats.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the subject of the Khasia mountains, it will be well\r\nto give a slight sketch of their prominent geographical features, in\r\nconnection with their geology. The general geological characters of the\r\nchain may be summed up in a few words. The nucleus or axis is of highly\r\ninclined stratified metamorphic rocks, through which the granite has\r\nbeen protruded, and the basalt and syenite afterwards injected. After\r\nextensive denudations of these, the sandstone, coal, and limestone were\r\nsuccessively deposited. These are altered and displaced along the\r\nsouthern edge of the range, by black amygdaloidal trap, and have in\r\ntheir turn been extensively denuded; and it is this last operation that\r\nhas sculptured the range, and given the mountains their present aspect;\r\nfor the same gneisses, slates, and basalts in other countries, present\r\nrugged peaks, domes, or cones, and there is nothing in their\r\ncomposition or arrangement here that explains the tabular or rounded\r\noutline they assume, or the uniform level of the spurs into which they\r\nrise, or the curious steep sides and flat floors of the valleys which\r\ndrain them.\r\n\r\nAll these peculiarities of outline are the result of denudation, of the\r\nspecific action of which agent we are very ignorant. The remarkable\r\ndifference between the steep cliffs on the south face of the range, and\r\nthe rounded outline of the hills on the northern slopes, may be\r\nexplained on the supposition that when the Khasia was partially\r\nsubmerged, the Assam valley was a broad bay or gulf; and that while the\r\nChurra cliffs were exposed to the full sweep of the ocean, the Nunklow\r\nshore was washed by a more tranquil sea.\r\n\r\nThe broad flat marshy heads of all the streams in the central and\r\nnorthern parts of the chain, and the rounded hills that separate them,\r\nindicate the levelling action of a tidal sea, acting on a low flat\r\nshore;[371] whilst the steep flat- floored valleys of the southern\r\nwatershed may be attributed to the scouring action of higher tides on a\r\nboisterous rocky coast. These views are confirmed by an examination of\r\nthe east shores of the Bay of Bengal, and particularly by a comparison\r\nof the features of the country about Silhet, now nearly 280 miles\r\ndistant from the sea, with those of the Chittagong coast, with which\r\nthey are identical.\r\n\r\n [371] Since our return to England, we have been much struck with the\r\n similarity in contour of the Essex and Suffolk coasts, and with the\r\n fact that the tidal coast sculpturing of this surface is preserved in\r\n the very centre of High Suffolk, twenty to thirty miles distant from\r\n the sea, in rounded outlines and broad flat marshy valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geological features of the Khasia are in many respects so similar\r\nto those of the Vindhya, Kymore, Behar, and Rajmahal mountains, that\r\nthey have been considered by some observers as an eastern prolongation\r\nof that great chain, from which they are geographically separated by\r\nthe delta of the Ganges and Burrampooter. The general contour of the\r\nmountains, and of their sandstone cliffs, is the same, and the\r\nassociation of this rock with coal and lime is a marked point of\r\nsimilarity; there is, however, this difference between them, that the\r\ncoal-shales of Khasia and limestone of Behar are non-fossiliferous,\r\nwhile the lime of Khasia and the coal-shales of Behar contain fossils.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent north-east strike of the gneiss is the same in both,\r\ndiffering from the Himalaya, where the stratified rocks generally\r\nstrike north-west. The nummulites of the limestone are the only known\r\nmeans we have of forming an approximate estimate of the age of the\r\nKhasia coal, which is the most interesting feature in the geology of\r\nthe range: these fossils have been examined by MM.

Thence\r\nwe continued our voyage 120 miles up the river in canoes, to Silchar,\r\nthe capital of the district of Cachar: the boats were such as I\r\ndescribed at Chattuc, and though it was impossible to sit upright in\r\nthem, they were paddled with great swiftness. The river at Silhet is\r\n200 yards broad; it is muddy, and flows with a gentle current of two to\r\nthree miles an hour, between banks six to twelve feet high. As we\r\nglided up its stream, villages became rarer, and eminences more\r\nfrequent in the Jheels. The people are a tall, bold, athletic Mahometan\r\nrace, who live much on the water, and cultivate rice, sesamum, and\r\nradishes, with betel-pepper in thatched enclosures as in Sikkim: maize\r\nand sugar are rarer, bamboos abound, and four palms (_Borassus, Areca,_\r\ncocoa-nut, and _Caryota_) are planted, but there are no date-palms.\r\n\r\nThe Teelas (or hillocks) are the haunts of wild boars, tigers, and\r\nelephants, but not of the rhinoceros; they are 80 to 200 feet high, of\r\nhorizontally stratified gravel and sand, slates, and clay\r\nconglomerates, with a slag-like honey-combed sandstone; they are\r\ncovered with oaks, figs, _Heretiera,_ and bamboos, and besides a\r\nmultitude of common Bengal plants, there are some which, though\r\ngenerally considered mountain or cold country genera, here descend to\r\nthe level of the sea; such are _Kadsura, Rubus, Camellia,_ and _Sabia_;\r\n_Aerides_ and _Saccolabia_ are the common orchids, and rattan-canes and\r\n_Pandani_ render the jungles impenetrable.\r\n\r\nA very long sedge (_Scleria_) grows by the water, and is used for\r\nthatching: boatloads of it are collected for the Calcutta market, for\r\nwhich also were destined many immense rafts of bamboo, 100 feet long.\r\nThe people fish much, using square and triangular drop-nets stretched\r\nupon bamboos, and rude basket-work weirs, that retain the fish as the\r\nriver falls. Near the villages we saw fragments of pottery three feet\r\nbelow the surface of the ground, shewing that the bank, which is higher\r\nthan the surrounding country, increases from the annual overflow.\r\n\r\nAbout seventy miles up the river, the mountains on the north, which are\r\neast of Jyntea, rise 4000 feet high in forest-clad ranges like those of\r\nSikkim. Swamps extend from the river to their base, and penetrate their\r\nvalleys, which are extremely malarious: these forests are frequented by\r\ntimber-cutters, who fell jarool (_Lagerstrœmia Reginæ_), a magnificent\r\ntree with red wood, which, though soft, is durable under water, and\r\ntherefore in universal use for boat-building. The toon is also cut,\r\nwith red sandal-wood (_Adenanthera pavonina_); also Nageesa,[373]\r\n_Mesua ferrea,_ which is highly valued for its weight, strength, and\r\ndurability: _Aquilaria agallocha,_ the eagle-wood, a tree yielding\r\nuggur oil, is also much sought for its fragrant wood, which is carried\r\nto Silhet and Azmerigunj, where it is broken up and distilled. Neither\r\nteak, sissoo, sal, nor other _Dipterocarpi,_ are found in these\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n [373] There is much dispute amongst oriental scholars about the word\r\n Nageesa; the Bombay philologists refer it to a species of _Garcinia,_\r\n whilst the pundits on the Calcutta side of India consider it to be\r\n _Mesua ferrea._ Throughout our travels in India, we were struck with\r\n the undue reliance placed on native names of plants, and information\r\n of all kinds; and the pertinacity with which each linguist adhered to\r\n his own crotchet as to the application of terms to natural objects,\r\n and their pronunciation. It is a very prevalent, but erroneous,\r\n impression, that savage and half-civilised people have an accurate\r\n knowledge of objects of natural history, and a uniform nomenclature\r\n for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPorpoises, and both the long and the short-nosed alligator, ascend the\r\nSoormah for 120 miles, being found beyond Silchar, which place we\r\nreached on the 22nd, and were most hospitably received by Colonel\r\nLister, the political agent commanding the Silhet Light Infantry, who\r\nwas inspecting the Cookie levy, a corps of hill-natives which had\r\nlately been enrolled.\r\n\r\nThe station is a small one, and stands about forty feet above the\r\nriver, which however rises half that height in the rains. Long low\r\nspurs of tertiary rocks stretch from the Tipperah hills for many miles\r\nnorth, through the swampy Jheels to the river; and there are also hills\r\non the opposite or north side, but detached from the Cookie hills, as\r\nthe lofty blue range twelve miles north of the Soormah is called. All\r\nthese mountains swarm with tigers, wild buffalos, and boars, which also\r\ninfest the long grass of the Jheels.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the house we occupied at Silchar was 116 feet above\r\nthe sea. The bank it stood on was of clay, with soft rocks of\r\nconglomerate, which often assume the appearance of a brown sandy slag.\r\n\r\nDuring the first Birmese war, Colonel Lister was sent with a force up\r\nto this remote corner of Bengal, when the country was an uninhabited\r\njungle, so full of tigers that not a day passed without one or more of\r\nhis grass or wood-cutters being carried off. Now, thousands of acres\r\nare cultivated with rice, and during our stay we did not see a tiger.\r\nThe quantity of land brought into cultivation in this part of Bengal,\r\nand indeed throughout the Gangetic delta, has probably been doubled\r\nduring the last twenty years, and speaks volumes for the state of the\r\npeasant under the Indian Company’s sway, as compared with his former\r\ncondition. The Silchar rice is of admirable quality, and much is\r\nimported to Silhet, the Jheels not producing grain enough for the\r\nconsumption of the people. Though Silchar grows enough for ten times\r\nits population, there was actually a famine six weeks before our\r\narrival, the demand from Silhet being so great.\r\n\r\nThe villages of Cachar are peopled by Mahometans, Munniporees, Nagas,\r\nand Cookies; the Cacharies themselves being a poor and peaceful jungle\r\ntribe, confined to the mountains north of the Soormah. The\r\nMunniporees[374] are emigrants from the kingdom of that name, which\r\nlies beyond the British possessions, and borders on Assam and Birmah.\r\nLow ranges of forest-clad mountains at the head of the Soormah,\r\nseparate it from Silchar, with which it is coterminous; the two chief\r\ntowns being seven marches apart. To the south-east of Silchar are\r\ninterminable jungles, peopled by the Cookies, a wild Indo-Chinese\r\ntribe, who live in a state of constant warfare, and possess the whole\r\nhill-country from this, southward to beyond Chittagong. Two years ago\r\nthey invaded and ravaged Cachar, carrying many of the inhabitants into\r\nslavery, and so frightening the people, that land previously worth six\r\nrupees a biggah, is now reduced to one and a half. Colonel Lister was\r\nsent with a strong party to rescue the captives, and marched for many\r\ndays through their country without disturbing man or beast; penetrating\r\ndeep forests of gigantic trees and tall bamboos, never seeing the sun\r\nabove, or aught to the right and left, save an occasional clearance and\r\na deserted village. The incursion, however, had its effects, and the\r\nbetter inclined near the frontier have since come forward, and been\r\nenrolled as the Cookie levy.\r\n\r\n [374] The Munnipore valley has never been explored by any naturalist,\r\n its mountains are said to be pine-clad, and to rise 8000 feet above\r\n the level of the sea. The Rajah is much harassed by the Birmese, and\r\n is a dependant of the British, who are in the very frequent dilemma of\r\n supporting on the throne a sovereign opposed by a strong faction of\r\n his countrymen, and who has very dubious claims to his position.\r\n During our stay at Silchar, the supposed rightful Rajah was prevailing\r\n over the usurper; a battle had been fought on the hills on the\r\n frontier, and two bodies floated past our bungalow, pierced with\r\n arrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Munnipore emigrants are industrious settlers for a time, but never\r\nremain long in one place: their religion is Hindoo, and they keep up a\r\nconsiderable trade with their own country, whence they import a large\r\nbreed of buffalos, ponies, silks, and cotton cloths dyed with arnotto\r\n(_Bixa_), and universally used for turbans. They use bamboo\r\nblowing-tubes and arrows for shooting birds, make excellent shields of\r\nrhinoceros hide (imported from Assam), and play at hockey on horseback\r\nlike the Western Tibetans. A fine black varnish from the fruit of\r\n_Holigarna longifolia,_ is imported from Munnipore, as is another made\r\nfrom _Sesuvium Anacardium_ (marking-nut), and a remarkable black\r\npigment resembling that from _Melanorhœa usitatissima,_ which is white\r\nwhen fresh, and requires to be kept under water.[375]\r\n\r\n [375] This turns of a beautiful black colour when applied to a\r\n surface, owing, according to Sir D. Brewster, to the fresh varnish\r\n consisting of a congeries of minute organised particles, which\r\n disperse the rays of light in all directions; the organic structure is\r\n destroyed when the varnish dries and the rays of light are\r\n consequently transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine moonlight night we went to see a Munnipore dance. A large\r\ncircular area was thatched with plantain leaves, growing on their\r\ntrunks, which were stuck in the ground; and round the enclosure was a\r\nborder neatly cut from the white leaf-sheaths of the same tree. A\r\ndouble enclosure of bamboo, similarly ornamented, left an inner circle\r\nfor the performers, and an outer for the spectators: the whole was\r\nlighted with oil lamps and Chinese paper lanterns. The musicians sat on\r\none side, with cymbals, tomtoms, and flutes, and sang choruses.\r\n\r\nThe performances began by a copper-coloured Cupid entering and calling\r\nthe virgins with a flute; these appeared from a green-room, to the\r\nnumber of thirty or forty, of all ages and sizes. Each had her hair\r\ndressed in a topknot, and her head covered with a veil; a scarlet\r\npetticoat loaded with tinsel concealed her naked feet, and over this\r\nwas a short red kirtle, and an enormous white shawl was swathed round\r\nthe body from the armpits to the waist. A broad belt passed over the\r\nright shoulder and under the left arm, to which hung gold and silver\r\nchains, corals, etc., with tinsel and small mirrors sewed on\r\neverywhere: the arms and hands were bare, and decorated with bangles\r\nand rings.\r\n\r\nMany of the women were extremely tall, great stature being common\r\namongst the Munniporees. They commenced with a prostration to Cupid,\r\naround whom they danced very slowly, with the arms stretched out, and\r\nthe hands in motion; at each step the free foot was swung backwards and\r\nforwards. Cupid then chose a partner, and standing in the middle went\r\nthrough the same motions, a compliment the women acknowledged by\r\ncurtseying and whirling round, making a sort of cheese with their\r\npetticoats, which, however, were too heavy to inflate properly.\r\n\r\nThe Nagas are another people found on this frontier, chiefly on the\r\nhills to the north: they are a wild, copper-coloured, uncouth jungle\r\ntribe, who have proved troublesome on the Assam frontier. Their\r\nfeatures are more Tartar than those of the Munniporees, especially\r\namongst the old men. They bury their dead under the threshold of their\r\ncottages. The men are all but naked, and stick plumes of hornbills’\r\nfeathers in their hair, which is bound with strips of bamboo: tufts of\r\nsmall feathers are passed through their ears, and worn as shoulder\r\nlappets. A short blue cotton cloth, with a fringe of tinsel and tufts\r\nof goat’s hair dyed red, is passed over the loins in front only: they\r\nalso wear brass armlets, and necklaces of cowries, coral, amber, ivory,\r\nand boar’s teeth. The women draw a fringed blue cloth tightly across\r\nthe breast, and wear a checked or striped petticoat. They are less\r\nornamented than the men, and are pleasing looking; their hair is\r\nstraight, and cut short over the eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe Naga dances are very different from those of the Munniporees; being\r\nquick, and performed in excellent time to harmonious music. The figures\r\nare regular, like quadrilles and country-dances: the men hold their\r\nknives erect during the performance, the women extend their arms only\r\nwhen turning partners, and then their hands are not given, but the\r\npalms are held opposite. The step is a sort of polka and balancez, very\r\ngraceful and lively. A bar of music is always played first, and at the\r\nend the spectators applaud with two short shouts. Their ear for music,\r\nand the nature of their dance, are as Tibetan as their countenances,\r\nand different from those of the Indo-Chinese tribes of the frontier.\r\n\r\nWe had the pleasure of meeting Lieutenant Raban at Silchar, and of\r\nmaking several excursions in the neighbourhood with him; for which\r\nColonel Lister here, as at Churra, afforded us every facility of\r\nelephants and men. Had we had time, it was our intention to have\r\nvisited Munnipore, but we were anxious to proceed to Chittagong. I\r\nhowever made a three days’ excursion to the frontier, about thirty\r\nmiles distant, proceeding along the north bank of the Soormah. On the\r\nway my elephant got bogged in crossing a deep muddy stream: this is\r\nsometimes an alarming position, as should the animal become terrified,\r\nhe will seize his rider, or pad, or any other object (except his\r\ndriver), to place under his knees to prevent his sinking. In this\r\ninstance the driver in great alarm ordered me off, and I had to\r\nflounder out through the black mud. The elephant remained fast all\r\nnight, and was released next morning by men with ropes.\r\n\r\nThe country continued a grassy level, with marshes and rice\r\ncultivation, to the first range of hills, beyond which the river is\r\nunnavigable; there also a forest commences, of oaks, figs, and the\r\ncommon trees of east Bengal. The road hence was a good one, cut by\r\nSepoys across the dividing ranges, the first of which is not 500 feet\r\nhigh. On the ascent bamboos abound, of the kind called Tuldah or\r\nDulloah, which has long very thin-walled joints; it attains no great\r\nsize, but is remarkably gregarious. On the east side of the range, the\r\nroad runs through soft shales and beds of clay, and conglomerates,\r\ndescending to a broad valley covered with gigantic scattered\r\ntimber-trees of jarool, acacia, _Diospyros, Urticeæ,_ and _Bauhiniæ,_\r\nrearing their enormous trunks above the bamboo jungle: immense\r\nrattan-canes wound through the forest, and in the gullies were groves\r\nof two kinds of tree-fern, two of _Areca, Wallichia_ palm, screw-pine,\r\nand _Dracæna._ Wild rice grew abundantly in the marshes, with tall\r\ngrasses; and _Cardiopteris_[376] covered the trees for upwards of sixty\r\nfeet, like hops, with a mass of pale-green foliage, and dry white\r\nglistening seed-vessels. This forest differed from those of the Silhet\r\nand Khasia mountains, especially in the abundance of bamboo jungle,\r\nwhich is, I believe, the prevalent feature of the low hills in Birmah,\r\nAva, and Munnipore; also in the gigantic size of the rattans, 1arger\r\npalms, and different forest trees, and in the scanty undergrowth of\r\nherbs and bushes. I only saw, however, the skirts of the forest; the\r\nmountains further east, which I am told rise several thousand feet in\r\nlimestone cliffs, are doubtless richer in herbaceous plants.\r\n\r\n [376] A remarkable plant of unknown affinity; see Brown and Bennett,\r\n “Flora Java:” it is found in the Assam valley and Chittagong.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of Cachar partakes of that of the Jheels in its damp\r\nequable character: during our stay the weather was fine, and dense fogs\r\nformed in the morning: the mean maximum was 80°, minimum 58·4°.[377]\r\n\r\n [377] The temperature does not rise above 90° in summer, nor sink\r\n below 45° or 50° in January: forty-seven comparative observations with\r\n Calcutta showed the mean temperature to be 1·8° lower at Silchar, and\r\n the air damper, the saturation point being, at Calcutta 0·3791, at\r\n Silchar 0·4379.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual rain-fall in 1850 was 111·60 inches, according to a register\r\nkindly given me by Captain Verner. There are few mosquitos, which is\r\none of the most curious facts in the geographical distribution of these\r\ncapricious bloodsuckers; for the locality is surrounded by swamps, and\r\nthey swarm at Silhet, and on the river lower down. Both on the passage\r\nup and down, we were tormented in our canoes by them for eighty or\r\nninety miles above Silhet, and thence onwards to Cachar we were free.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, we were preparing for our return to Silhet,\r\nand our canoes were loading, when we were surprised by a loud rushing\r\nnoise, and saw a high wave coming down the river, swamping every boat\r\nthat remained on its banks, whilst most of those that pushed out into\r\nthe stream, escaped with a violent rocking. It was caused by a slip of\r\nthe bank three quarters of a mile up the stream, of no great size, but\r\nwhich propagated a high wave. This appeared to move on at about the\r\nrate of a mile in three or four minutes, giving plenty of time for our\r\nboatmen to push out from the land on hearing the shouts of those first\r\novertaken by the calamity; but they were too timid, and consequently\r\none of our canoes, full of papers, instruments, and clothes, was\r\nswamped. Happily our dried collections were not embarked, and the hot\r\nsun repaired much of the damage.\r\n\r\nWe left in the evening of the 2nd of December, and proceeded to Silhet,\r\nwhere we were kindly received by Mr. Stainforth, the district judge.\r\nSilhet, the capital of the district of the same name, is a large\r\nMahometan town, occupying a slightly raised part of the Jheels, where\r\nmany of the Teelas seem joined together by beds of gravel and sand. In\r\nthe rains it, is surrounded by water, and all communication with other\r\nparts is by boats: in winter, Jynteapore and Pundua may be reached by\r\nland, crossing creeks innumerable on the way. Mr. Stainforth’s house,\r\nlike those of most of the other Europeans, occupies the top of one of\r\nthe Teelas, 150 feet high, and is surrounded by fine spreading\r\noaks,[378] _Garcinia,_ and _Diospyros_ trees. The rock of which the\r\nhill is composed, is a slag-like ochreous sandstone, covered in most\r\nplaces with a shrubbery of rose-flowered _Melastoma,_ and some peculiar\r\nplants.[379]\r\n\r\n [378] It is not generally known that oaks are often very tropical\r\n plants; not only abounding at low elevations in the mountains, but\r\n descending in abundance to the level of the sea. Though unknown in\r\n Ceylon, the Peninsula of India, tropical Africa, or South America,\r\n they abound in the hot valleys of the Eastern Himalaya, East Bengal,\r\n Malay Peninsula, and Indian islands; where perhaps more species grow\r\n than in any other part of the world. Such facts as this disturb our\r\n preconceived notions of the geographical distribution of the most\r\n familiar tribes of plants, and throw great doubt on the conclusions\r\n which fossil plants are supposed to indicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n [379] _Gelonium, Adelia, Moacurra, Linostoma, Justicia, Trophis,\r\n Connarus, Ixora, Congea, Dalhousiea, Grewia, Myrsine, Buttneria_; and\r\n on the shady exposures a _Calamus, Briedelia,_ and various ferns.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroad flat valleys divide the hills, and are beautifully clothed with a\r\nbright green jungle of small palms, and many kinds of ferns. In sandy\r\nplaces, blue-flowered _Burmannia, Hypoxis,_ and other pretty tropical\r\nannuals, expand their blossoms, with an inconspicuous _Stylidium,_ a\r\nplant belonging to a small natural family, whose limits are so confined\r\nto New Holland, that this is almost the only kind that does not grow in\r\nthat continent. Where the ground is swampy, dwarf _Pandanus_ abounds,\r\nwith the gigantic nettle, _Urtica crenulata_ (“Mealum-ma” of Sikkim,\r\nsee p. 189).\r\n\r\nThe most interesting botanical ramble about Silhet is to the tree-fern\r\ngroves on the path to Jynteapore, following the bottoms of shallow\r\nvalleys between the Teelas, and along clear streams, up whose beds we\r\nwaded for some miles, under an arching canopy of tropical shrubs,\r\ntrees, and climbers, tall grasses, screw-pines, and _Aroideæ._ In the\r\nnarrower parts of the valleys the tree-ferns are numerous on the\r\nslopes, rearing their slender brown trunks forty feet high, with\r\nfeathery crowns of foliage, through which the sun-beams trembled on the\r\nbroad shining foliage of the tropical herbage below.\r\n\r\nSilhet, though hot and damp, is remarkably healthy, and does not differ\r\nmaterially in temperature from Silchar, though it is more equable and\r\nhumid.[380] It derives some interest from having been first brought\r\ninto notice by the enterprise of one of the Lindsays of Balcarres, at a\r\ntime when the pioneers of commerce in India encountered great hardships\r\nand much personal danger. Mr. Lindsay, a writer in the service of the\r\nEast India Company, established a factory at Silhet, and commenced the\r\nlime trade with Calcutta,[381] reaping an enormous fortune himself, and\r\nlaying the foundation of that prosperity amongst the people which has\r\nbeen much advanced by the exertions of the Inglis family, and has\r\nsteadily progressed under the protecting rule of the Indian government.\r\n\r\n [380] During our stay of five days the mean maximum temperature was\r\n 74°, minimum 64·8°: that of thirty-two observations compared with\r\n Calcutta show that Silhet is only 1·7° cooler, though Mr. Stainforth’s\r\n house is upwards of 2° further north, and 160 feet more elevated. A\r\n thermometer sunk two feet seven inches, stood at 73·5°. The relative\r\n saturation-points were, Calcutta ·633, Silhet ·821.\r\n\r\n\r\n [381] For an account of the early settlement of Silhet, see “Lives of\r\n the Lindsays,” by Lord Lindsay.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Silhet we took large boats to navigate the Burrampooter and Megna,\r\nto their embouchure in the Bay of Bengal at Noacolly, a distance of 250\r\nmiles, whence we were to proceed across the head of the bay to\r\nChittagong, about 100 miles farther. We left on the 7th of December,\r\nand arrived at Chattuc on the 9th, where we met our Khasia collectors\r\nwith large loads of plants, and paid them off. The river was now low,\r\nand presented a busy scene, from the numerous trading boats being\r\nconfined to its fewer and deeper channels. Long grasses and sedges\r\n(_Arundo, Saccharum_ and _Scleria_), were cut, and stacked along the\r\nwater’s edge, in huge brown piles, for export and thatching.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th December, we entered the broad stream of the Megna. Rice is\r\ncultivated along the mud flats left by the annual floods, and the banks\r\nare lower and less defined than in the Soormah, and support no long\r\ngrasses or bushes. Enormous islets of living water-grasses (_Oplismenus\r\nstagninus_) and other plants, floated past, and birds became more\r\nnumerous, especially martins and egrets. The sun was hot, but the\r\nweather otherwise cool and pleasant: the mean temperature was nearly\r\nthat of Calcutta, 69·7°, but the atmosphere was more humid.[382]\r\n\r\n [382] The river-water was greenish, and a little cooler (73·8°) than\r\n that of the Soormah (74·3°), which was brown and muddy. The barometer\r\n on the Soormah stood 0·028 inch higher than that of Calcutta (on the\r\n mean of thirty-eight observations), whereas on the Megna the pressure\r\n was 0·010 higher. As Calcutta is eighteen feet above the level of the\r\n Bay of Bengal, this shows that the Megna (which has no perceptible\r\n current) is at the level of the sea, and that either the Soormah is\r\n upwards of thirty feet above that level, or that the atmospheric\r\n pressure there, and at this season, is less than at Calcutta, which,\r\n as I have hinted at p. 259, is probably the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 14th we passed the Dacca river; below which the Megna is several\r\nmiles wide, and there is an appearance of tide, from masses of purple\r\n_Salvinia_ (a floating plant, allied to ferns), being thrown up on the\r\nbeach like sea-weed. Still lower down, the vegetation of the\r\nSunderbunds commences; there is a narrow beach, and behind it a mud\r\nbank several feet high, supporting a luxuriant green jungle of palms\r\n(_Borassus_ and _Phœnix_), immense fig-trees, covered with _Calami,_\r\nand tall betel-palms, clothed with the most elegant drapery of\r\n_Arostichum scandens,_ a climbing fern with pendulous fronds.\r\n\r\nTowards the embouchure, the banks rise ten feet high, the river expands\r\ninto a muddy sea, and a long swell rolls in, to the disquiet of our\r\nfresh-water boatmen. Low islands of sand and mud stretch along the\r\nhorizon: which, together with the ships, distorted by extraordinary\r\nrefraction, flicker as if seen through smoke. Mud is the all prevalent\r\nfeature; and though the water is not salt, we do not observe in these\r\nbroad deltas that amount of animal life (birds, fish, alligators, and\r\nporpoises), that teems in the narrow creeks of the western Sunderbunds.\r\n\r\nWe landed in a canal-like creek at Tuktacolly,[383] on the 17th, and\r\nwalked to Noacolly, over a flat of hard mud or dried silt, covered with\r\nturf of _Cynodon Dactylon._ We were hospitably received by Dr. Baker, a\r\ngentleman who has resided here for twenty-three years; and who\r\ncommunicated to us much interesting information respecting the features\r\nof the Gangetic delta.\r\n\r\n [383] “Colly” signifies a muddy creek, such as intersect the delta.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoacolly is a station for collecting the revenue and preventing the\r\nmanufacture of salt, which, with opium, are the only monopolies now in\r\nthe hands of the East India Company. The salt itself is imported from\r\nArracan, Ceylon, and even Europe, and is stored in great wooden\r\nbuildings here and elsewhere. The ground being impregnated with salt,\r\nthe illicit manufacture by evaporation is not easily checked; but\r\nwhereas the average number of cases brought to justice used to be\r\ntwenty and thirty in a week, they are now reduced to two or three. It\r\nis remarkable, that though the soil yields such an abundance of this\r\nmineral, the water of the Megna at Noacolly is only brackish, and it is\r\ntherefore to repeated inundations and surface evaporations that the\r\nsalt is due. Fresh water is found at a very few feet depth everywhere,\r\nbut it is not good.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered how comparatively narrow the sea-board of the\r\ndelta is, the amount of difference in the physical features of the\r\nseveral parts, will appear most extraordinary. I have stated that the\r\ndifference between the northern and southern halves of the delta is so\r\ngreat, that, were all depressed and their contents fossilised, the\r\ngeologist who examined each by itself, would hardly recognise the two\r\nparts as belonging to one epoch; and the difference between the east\r\nand west halves of the lower delta is equally remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe total breadth of the delta is 260 miles, from Chittagong to the\r\nmouth of the Hoogly, divided longitudinally by the Megna: all to the\r\nwest of that river presents a luxuriant vegetation, while to the east\r\nis a bare muddy expanse, with no trees or shrubs but what are planted\r\nOn the west coast the tides rise twelve or thirteen feet, on the east,\r\nfrom forty to eighty. On the west, the water is salt enough for\r\nmangroves to grow for fifty miles up the Hoogly; on the east, the sea\r\ncoast is too fresh for that plant for ten miles south of Chittagong. On\r\nthe west, fifty inches is the Cuttack fall of rain; on the east, 90 to\r\n120 at Noacolly and Chittagong, and 200 at Arracan. The east coast is\r\nannually visited by earthquakes, which are rare on the west; and\r\nlastly, the majority of the great trees and shrubs carried down from\r\nthe Cuttack and Orissa forests, and deposited on the west coast of the\r\ndelta, are not only different in species, but in natural order, from\r\nthose that the Fenny and Chittagong rivers bring down from the\r\njungles.[384]\r\n\r\n [384] The Cuttack forests are composed of teak, Sal, Sissoo, ebony,\r\n _Pentaptera, Buchanania,_ and other trees of a dry soil, and that\r\n require a dry season alternating with a wet one. These are unknown in\r\n the Chittagong forests, which have Jarool (_Lagerstrœmia_) _Mesua,\r\n Dipterocarpi,_ nutmegs, oaks of several kinds, and many other trees\r\n not known in the Cuttack forests, and all typical of a perennially\r\n humid atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were glad to find at Noacolly that our observations on the\r\nprogression westwards of the Burrampooter (see p. 253) were confirmed\r\nby the fact that the Megna also is gradually moving in that direction,\r\nleaving much dry land on the Noacolly side, and forming islands\r\nopposite that coast; whilst it encroaches on the Sunderbunds, and is\r\ncutting away the islands in that direction. This advance of the fresh\r\nwaters amongst the Sunderbunds is destructive to the vegetation of the\r\nlatter, which requires salt; and if the Megna continues its slow course\r\nwestwards, the obliteration of thousands of square miles of a very\r\npeculiar flora, and the extinction of many species of plants and\r\nanimals that exist nowhere else, may ensue. In ordinary cases these\r\nplants, etc., would take up their abode on the east coast, as they were\r\ndriven from the west; but such might not be the case in this delta; for\r\nthe sweeping tides of the east coast prevent any such vegetation\r\nestablishing itself there, and the mud which the eastern rivers carry\r\ndown, becomes a caking dry soil, unsuited to the germination of seeds.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Calcutta in the following February, Dr. Falconer\r\nshowed us specimens of very modern peat, dug out of the banks of the\r\nHoogly a few feet below the surface of the soil, in which were seeds of\r\nthe _Euryale ferox_:[385] this plant is not now known to be found\r\nnearer than Dacca (sixty miles north-east, see p. 255), and indicates a\r\nvery different state of the surface at Calcutta at the date of its\r\ndeposition than that which exists now, and also shows that the estuary\r\nwas then much fresher.\r\n\r\n [385] This peat Dr. Falconer also found to contain bones of birds and\r\n fish, seeds of _Cucumis Madraspatana_ and another Cucurbitaceous\r\n plant, leaves of _Saccharum Sara_ and _Ficus cordifolia._ Specks of\r\n some glistening substance were scattered through the mass, apparently\r\n incipient carbonisation of the peat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main land of Noacolly is gradually extending seawards, and has\r\nadvanced four miles within twenty- three years: this seems sufficiently\r\naccounted for by the recession of the Megna. The elevation of the\r\nsurface of the land is caused by the overwhelming tides and south-west\r\nhurricanes in May and October: these extend thirty miles north and\r\nsouth of Chittagong, and carry the waters of the Megna and Fenny back\r\nover the land, in a series of tremendous waves, that cover islands of\r\nmany hundred acres, and roll three miles on to the main land. On these\r\noccasions, the average earthy deposit of silt, separated by micaceous\r\nsand, is an eighth of an inch for every tide; but in October, 1848,\r\nthese tides covered Sundeep island, deposited six inches on its level\r\nsurface, and filled ditches several feet deep. These deposits become\r\nbaked by a tropical sun, and resist to a considerable degree denudation\r\nby rain. Whether any further rise is caused by elevation from below is\r\ndoubtful; there is no direct evidence of it, though slight earthquakes\r\nannually occur; and even when they have not been felt, the water of\r\ntanks has been seen to oscillate for three-quarters of an hour without\r\nintermission, from no discernible cause.[386]\r\n\r\n [386] The natives are familiar with this phenomenon, of which Dr.\r\n Baker remembers two instances, one in the cold season of 1834–5, the\r\n other in that of 1830–1. The earthquakes do not affect any particular\r\n month, nor are they accompanied by any meteorological phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoacolly is considered a healthy spot, which is not the case with the\r\nSunderbund stations west of the Megna. The climate is uniformly hot,\r\nbut the thermometer never rises above 90°, nor sinks below 45°; at this\r\ntemperature hoar-frost will form on straw, and ice on water placed in\r\nporous pans, indicating a powerful radiation.[387]\r\n\r\n [387] The winds are north-west and north in the cold season (from\r\n November to March), drawing round to west in the afternoons.\r\n North-west winds and heavy hailstorms are frequent from March to May,\r\n when violent gales set in from the southward. The rains commence in\r\n June, with easterly and southerly winds, and the temperature from 82°\r\n to 84°; May and October are the hottest months. The rains cease in the\r\n end of October (on the 8th of November in 1849, and 12th of November\r\n in 1850, the latest epoch ever remembered): there is no land or sea\r\n breeze along any part of the coast. During our stay we found the mean\r\n temperature for twelve observations to be precisely that of Calcutta,\r\n but the humidity was more, and the pressure 0·040 lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Noacolly on the 19th for Chittagong; the state of the tide\r\nobliging us to go on board in the night. The distance is only 100\r\nmiles, but the passage is considered dangerous at this time (during the\r\nspring-tides) and we were therefore provided with a large vessel and an\r\nexperienced crew. The great object in this navigation is to keep afloat\r\nand to make progress towards the top of the tide and during its flood,\r\nand to ground during the ebb in creeks where the bore (tidal wave) is\r\nnot violent; for where the channels are broad and open, the height and\r\nforce of this wave rolls the largest coasting craft over and swamps\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOur boatmen pushed out at 3 in the morning, and brought up at 5, in a\r\nnarrow muddy creek on the island of Sidhee. The waters retired along\r\nchannels scooped several fathoms deep in black mud, leaving our vessel\r\naground six or seven feet below the top of the bank, and soon\r\nafterwards there was no water to be seen; as far as the eye could\r\nreach, all was a glistening oozy mud, except the bleak level surfaces\r\nof the islands, on which neither shrub nor tree grew. Soon after 2 p.m.\r\na white line was seen on the low black horizon, which was the\r\ntide-wave, advancing at the rate of five miles an hour, with a hollow\r\nroar; it bore back the mud that was gradually slipping along the gentle\r\nslope, and we were afloat an hour after: at night we grounded again,\r\nopposite the mouth of the Fenny.\r\n\r\nBy moonlight the scene was oppressively solemn: on all sides the\r\ngurgling waters kept up a peculiar sound that filled the air with\r\nsullen murmurs; the moonbeams slept upon the slimy surface of the mud,\r\nand made the dismal landscape more ghastly still. Silence followed the\r\nebb, broken occasionally by the wild whistle of a bird like the curlew,\r\nof which a few wheeled through the air: till the harsh roar of the bore\r\nwas heard, to which the sailors seemed to waken by instinct. The waters\r\nthen closed in on every side, and the far end of the reflected moonbeam\r\nwas broken into flashing light, that approached and soon danced beside\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nWe much regretted not being able to obtain any more accurate data than\r\nI have given, as to the height of the tide at the mouth of the Fenny;\r\nbut where the ebb sometimes retires twenty miles from high-water mark,\r\nit is obviously impossible to plant any tide-gauge.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st we were ashore at daylight on the Chittagong coast far\r\nnorth of the station, and were greeted by the sight of hills on the\r\nhorizon: we were lying fully twenty feet below high-water mark, and the\r\ntide was out for several miles to the westward. The bank was covered\r\nwith flocks of white geese feeding on short grass, upon what appeared\r\nto be detached islets on the surface of the mud. These islets, which\r\nare often an acre in extent, are composed of stratified mud; they have\r\nperpendicular sides several feet high, and convex surfaces, owing to\r\nthe tide washing away the earth from under their sides; and they were\r\nfurther slipping seawards, along the gently sloping mud-beach. Few or\r\nno shells or seaweed were to be seen, nor is it possible to imagine a\r\nmore lifeless sea than these muddy coasts present.\r\n\r\nWe were three days and nights on this short voyage, without losing\r\nsight of mud or land. I observed the barometer whenever the boat was on\r\nthe shore, and found the mean of six readings (all reduced to the same\r\nlevel) to be identical with that at Calcutta. These being all taken at\r\nelevations lower than that of the Calcutta observatory, show either a\r\ndiminished atmospheric pressure, or that the mean level of high-water\r\nis not the same on the east and west coasts of the Bay of Bengal: this\r\nis quite possible, considering the widely different direction of the\r\ntides and currents on each, and that the waters may be banked up, as it\r\nwere, in the narrow channels of the western Sunderbunds. The\r\ntemperature of the air was the same as at Calcutta, but the atmosphere\r\nwas damper. The water was always a degree warmer than the air.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Chittagong on the 23rd of December, and became the guests\r\nof Mr. Sconce, Judge of the district, and of Mr. Lautour; to both of\r\nwhom we were greatly indebted for their hospitality and generous\r\nassistance in every way.\r\n\r\nChittagong is a large town of Mahometans and Mugs, a Birmese tribe who\r\ninhabit many parts of the Malay peninsula, and the coast to the\r\nnorthward of it. The town stands on the north shore of an extensive\r\ndelta, formed by rivers from the lofty mountains separating this\r\ndistrict from Birma. These mountains are fine objects on the horizon,\r\nrising 4000 to 8000 feet; they are forest-clad, and inhabited by\r\nturbulent races, who are coterminous with the Cookies of the Cachar and\r\nTipperah forests; if indeed they be not the same people. The mountains\r\nabound with the splendid timber-trees of the Cachar forests, but like\r\nthese are said to want teak, Sal, and Sissoo; they have, besides many\r\nothers,, magnificent Gurjun trees (_Dipterocarpi_), the monarchs of the\r\nforests of these coasts.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Chittagong are excellent shipbuilders and active\r\ntraders, and export much rice and timber to Madras and Calcutta. The\r\ntown is large and beautifully situated, interspersed with trees and\r\ntanks; the hills resemble those of Silhet, and are covered with a\r\nsimilar vegetation: on these the European houses are built. The climate\r\nis very healthy, which is not remarkable, considering how closely it\r\napproximates in character to that of Silhet and other places in Eastern\r\nBengal, but very extraordinary, if it be compared with Arracan, only\r\n200 miles further south, which is extremely unhealthy. The prominent\r\ndifference between the physical features of Chittagong and Arracan, is\r\nthe presence of mangrove swamps at the latter place, for which the\r\nwater is too fresh at the former.\r\n\r\nThe hills about the station are not more than 150 or 200 feet high, and\r\nare formed of stratified gravel, sand, and clay, that often becomes\r\nnodular, and is interstratified with slag-like iron clay. Fossil wood\r\nis found; and some of the old buildings about Chittagong contain\r\nnummulitic limestone, probably imported from Silhet or the peninsula of\r\nIndia, with which countries there is no such trade now. The views are\r\nbeautiful, of the blue mountains forty to fifty miles distant, and the\r\nmany-armed river, covered with sails, winding amongst groves of\r\ncocoa-nuts, Areca palm, and yellow rice fields. Good European houses\r\nsurmount all the eminences, surrounded by trees of _Acacia_ and\r\n_Cæsalpinia._ In the hollows are native huts amidst vegetation of every\r\nhue, glossy green _Garciniæ_ and figs, broad plantains, feathery\r\n_Cassia_ and Acacias, dark _Mesua_, red-purple _Terminalia,_ leafless\r\nscarlet-flowered _Bombax,_ and grey _Casuarina._[388] Seaward the tide\r\nleaves immense flats, called churs, which stretch for many miles on\r\neither side the offing.\r\n\r\n [388] This, which is almost exclusively an Australian genus, is not\r\n indigenous at Chittagong: to it belongs an extra-Australian species\r\n common in the Malay islands, and found wild as far north as Arracan.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe accompanied Mr. Sconce to a bungalow which he has built at the\r\ntelegraph station at the south head of the harbour: its situation, on a\r\nhill 100 feet above the sea, is exposed, and at this season the\r\nsea-breeze was invigorating, and even cold, as it blew through the\r\nmat-walls of the bungalow.[389] To the south, undulating dunes stretch\r\nalong the coast, covered with low bushes, of which a red-flowered\r\n_Melastoma_ is the most prevalent,[390] and is considered a species of\r\n_Rhododendron_ by many of the residents! The flats along the beach are\r\nseveral miles broad, intersected with tidal creeks, and covered with\r\nshort grass, while below high-water mark all is mud, coated with green\r\n_Conferva._ There are no leafy seaweeds or mangroves, nor any seaside\r\nshrub but _Dilivaria ilicifolia._ Animal life is extremely rare; and a\r\n_Cardium_-like shell and small crab are found sparingly.\r\n\r\n [389] The mean temperature of the two days (29th and 30th) we spent at\r\n this bungalow was 66·5°, that of Calcutta being 67·6°; the air was\r\n damp, and the barometer 0·144 lower at the flagstaff hill, but it fell\r\n and rose with the Calcutta instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n [390] _Melastoma,_ jasmine, _Calamus, Ægle Marmelos, Adelia,\r\n Memecylon, Ixora, Limostoma, Congea,_ climbing _Cœsalpinia,_ and many\r\n other plants; and along their bases large trees of _Amoora, Gaurea,_\r\n figs, _Mesua,_ and _Micromelon._\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee has been cultivated at Chittagong with great success; it is said\r\nto have been introduced by Sir W. Jones, and Mr. Sconce has a small\r\nplantation, from which his table is well supplied. Both Assam and\r\nChinese teas flourish, but Chinamen are wanted to cure the leaves.\r\nBlack pepper succeeds admirably, as do cinnamon, arrowroot, and ginger.\r\n\r\nEarly in January we accompanied Mr. Lautour on an excursion to the\r\nnorth, following a valley separated from the coast by a range of wooded\r\nhills, 1000 feet high. For several marches the bottom of this valley\r\nwas broad, flat, and full of villages. At Sidhee, about twenty-five\r\nmiles from Chittagong, it contracts, and spurs from the hills on either\r\nflank project into the middle: they are 200 to 300 feet high, formed of\r\nred clay, and covered with brushwood. At Kajee-ke-hath, the most\r\nnorthern point we reached, we were quite amongst these hills, and in an\r\nextremely picturesque country, intersected by long winding flat\r\nvalleys, that join one another: some are full of copsewood, while\r\nothers present the most beautiful park-like scenery, and a third class\r\nexpand into grassy marshes or lake-beds, with wooded islets rising out\r\nof them. The hillsides are clothed with low jungle, above which tower\r\nmagnificent Gurjun trees (wood-oil). The whole contour of this country\r\nis that of a low bay, whose coast is raised above the sea, and over\r\nwhich a high tide once swept for ages.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Hazari-ke-hath is not 100 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. It is about ten miles west of the mouth of the Fenny, from which\r\nit is separated by hills 1000 feet high; its river falls into that at\r\nChittagong, thirty miles south. Large myrtaceous trees (_Eugenia_) are\r\ncommon, and show a tendency to the Malayan flora, which is further\r\ndemonstrated by the abundance of Gurjun (_Dipterocarpus turbinatus_).\r\nThis is the most superb tree we met with in the Indian forests: we saw\r\nseveral species, but this is the only common one here; it is\r\nconspicuous for its gigantic size, and for the straightness and\r\ngraceful form of its tall unbranched pale grey trunk, and small\r\nsymmetrical crown: many individuals were upwards of 200 feet high, and\r\nfifteen in girth. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and beautiful; the\r\nflowers (then falling) are not conspicuous; the wood is hard,\r\nclose-grained, and durable, and a fragrant oil exudes from the trunk,\r\nwhich is extremely valuable as pitch and varnish, etc., besides being a\r\ngood medicine. The natives procure it by cutting transverse holes in\r\nthe trunk, pointing downwards, and lighting fires in them, which causes\r\nthe oil to flow.[391]\r\n\r\n [391] The other trees of these dry forests are many oaks, _Henslowia,\r\n Gordonia, Engelhardtia, Duabanga, Adelia, Byttneria, Bradleia,_ and\r\n large trees of _Pongamia,_ whose seeds yield a useful oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gurjun tree]\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January we experienced a sharp earthquake, preceded by a\r\ndull thumping sound; it lasted about twenty seconds, and seemed to come\r\nup from the southward; the water of a tank by which we were seated was\r\nsmartly agitated. The same shock was felt at Mymensing and at Dacca,\r\n110 miles north-west of this.[392]\r\n\r\n [392] Earthquakes are extremely common, and sometimes violent, at\r\n Chittagong, and doubtless belong to the volcanic forces of the Malayan\r\n peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe crossed the dividing ridge of the littoral range on the 9th, and\r\ndescended to Seetakoond bungalow, on the high road from Chittagong to\r\nComilla. The forests at the foot of the range were very extensive, and\r\nswarmed with large red ants that proved very irritating: they build\r\nimmense pendulous nests of dead and living leaves at the ends of the\r\nbranches of trees, and mat them with a white web. Tigers, leopards,\r\nwild dogs, and boars, are numerous; as are snipes, pheasants, peacocks,\r\nand jungle-fowl, the latter waking the morn with their shrill crows;\r\nand in strange association with them, common English woodcock, is\r\noccasionally found.\r\n\r\nThe trees are of little value, except the Gurjun, and “Kistooma,” a\r\nspecies of _Bradleia,_ which was stacked extensively, being used for\r\nbuilding purposes. The papaw[393] is abundantly cultivated, and its\r\ngreat gourd-like fruit is eaten (called “Papita” or “Chinaman”); the\r\nflavour is that of a bad melon, and a white juice exudes from the rind.\r\nThe _Hodgsonia heteroclita_ (_Trichosanthes_ of Roxburgh), a\r\nmagnificent Cucurbitaceous climber, grows in these forests; it is the\r\nsame species as the Sikkim one (see p. 7). The long stem bleeds\r\ncopiously when cut, and like almost all woody climbers, is full of\r\nlarge vessels; the juice does not, however, exude from these great\r\ntubes, which hold air, but from the close woody fibres. A climbing\r\n_Apocyneous_ plant grows in these forests, the milk of which flows in a\r\ncontinuous stream, resembling caoutchouc (it is probably the _Urceola\r\nelastica,_ which yields Indian-rubber).\r\n\r\n [393] The Papaw tree is said to have the curious property of rendering\r\n tough meat tender, when hung under its leaves, or touched with the\r\n juice; this hastening the process of decay. With this fact, well-known\r\n in the West Indies, I never found a person in the East acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of bleeding is involved in great obscurity, and the\r\nsystematic examination of the motions in the juices of tropical\r\nclimbers by resident observers, offers a fertile field to the\r\nnaturalist. I have often remarked that if a climbing stem, in which the\r\ncirculation is vigorous, be cut across, it bleeds freely from both\r\nends, and most copiously from the lower, if it be turned downwards; but\r\nthat if a truncheon be severed, there will be no flow from either of\r\nits extremities. This is the case with all the Indian watery-juiced\r\nclimbers, at whatever season they may be cut. When, however, the\r\ncirculation in the plant is feeble, neither end of a simple cut will\r\nbleed much, but if a truncheon be taken from it, both the extremities\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of the hills, which are densely wooded, was along spurs, and\r\nover knolls of clay; the rocks were sandy and slaty (dip north-east\r\n60°. The road was good, but always through bamboo jungle, and it wound\r\namongst the low spurs, so that there was no defined crest or top of the\r\npass, which is about 800 feet high. There were no tall palms,\r\ntree-ferns, or plantains, no _Hymenophylla_ or _Lycopodia,_ and\r\naltogether the forest was smaller and poorer in plants than we had\r\nexpected. The only palms (except a few rattans) were two kinds of\r\n_Wallichia._\r\n\r\nFrom the summit we obtained a very extensive and singular view. At our\r\nfeet was a broad, low, grassy, alluvial plain, intersected by creeks,\r\nbounding a black expanse of mud which (the tide being out) appeared to\r\nstretch almost continuously to Sundeep Island, thirty miles distant;\r\nwhile beyond, the blue hills of Tipperah rose on the north-west\r\nhorizon. The rocks yielded a dry poor soil, on which grew dwarf\r\n_Phœnix_ and cycas-palm (_Cycas circinalis_ or _pectinata_).\r\n\r\nDescending, we rode several miles along an excellent road, that runs to\r\nTipperah, and stopped at the bungalow of Seetakoond, twenty-five miles\r\nnorth of Chittagong. The west flank of the range which we had crossed\r\nis much steeper than the east, often precipitous, and presents the\r\nappearance of a sea-worn cliff towards the Bay of Bengal. Near\r\nSeetakoond (which is on the plain) a hill on the range, bearing the\r\nsame name, rises 1,136 feet high, and being damper and more luxuriantly\r\nwooded, we were anxious to explore it, and therefore spent some days at\r\nthe bungalow. Fields of poppy and sun (_Crotalaria juncea_), formed\r\nmost beautiful crops; the latter grows from four to six feet high, and\r\nbears masses of laburnum-like flowers, while the poppy fields resembled\r\na carpet of dark-green velvet, sprinkled with white stars; or, as I\r\nhave elsewhere remarked, a green lake studded with water-lilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seetakund Hill]\r\n\r\nThe road to the top of Seetakoond leads along a most beautiful valley,\r\nand then winds up a cliff that is in many places almost precipitous,\r\nthe ascent being partly by steps cut in the rock, of which there are\r\n560. The mountain is very sacred, and there is a large Brahmin temple\r\non its flank; and near the base a perpetual flame bursts out of the\r\nrock. This we were anxious to examine, and were extremely disappointed\r\nto find it a small vertical hole in a slaty rock, with a lateral one\r\nbelow for a draught; and that it is daily supplied by pious pilgrims\r\nand Brahmins with such enormous quantities of ghee (liquid butter),\r\nthat it is to all intents and purposes an artificial lamp; no trace of\r\nnatural phenomena being discoverable.\r\n\r\nOn the dry but wooded west face of the mountain, grows _Falconeria,_ a\r\ncurious Euphorbiaceous tree, with an acrid milky juice that affects the\r\neyes when the wood is cut. Beautiful _Cycas_ palms are also common,\r\nwith _Terminalia, Bignonia, Sterculia,_ dwarf _Phœnix_ palm, and Gurjun\r\ntrees. The east slope of the mountain is damper, and much more densely\r\nwooded; we there found two wild species of nutmeg trees, whose wood is\r\nfull of a brown acrid oil, seven palms, tree-ferns, and many other\r\nkinds of ferns, several kinds of oak, _Dracæna,_ and figs. The top is\r\n1,136 feet above the sea, and commands an extensive view to all points\r\nof the compass; but the forests, in which the ashy bark of the Gurjun\r\ntrees is conspicuous, and the beautiful valley on the west, are the\r\nonly attractive features.\r\n\r\nThe weather on the east side of the range differs at this season\r\nremarkably from that on the west, where the vicinity of the sea keeps\r\nthe atmosphere more humid and warm, and at the same time prevents the\r\nformation of the dense fogs that hang over the valleys to the eastward\r\nevery morning at sunrise. We found the mean temperature at the\r\nbungalow, from January 9th till the 13th, to be 70·2°.\r\n\r\nWe embarked again at Chittagong on the 16th of January, at 10 p.m., for\r\nCalcutta, in a very large vessel, rowed by twelve men: we made\r\nwretchedly slow progress, for the reasons mentioned above (p. 343),\r\nbeing for four days within sight of Chittagong! On the 20th we only\r\nreached Sidhee, and thence made a stretch to Hattiah, an island which\r\nmay be said to be moving bodily to the westward, the Megna annually\r\ncutting many acres from the east side; and the tide-wave depositing mud\r\non the west. The surface is flat, and raised four feet above mean\r\nhigh-water level; the tide rises about 14 feet up the bank, and then\r\nretires for miles; the total rise and fall is, however, much less here\r\nthan in the Fenny, higher up the gulf. The turf is composed of\r\n_Cynodon_ and a _Fimbristylis_; and the earth being impregnated with\r\nsalt, supports different kinds of _Chenopodium._ Two kinds of tamarisk,\r\nand a thorny _Cassia_ and _Exœcaria,_ are the only shrubs on the\r\neastern islands; on the central ones a few dwarf mangroves appear, with\r\nthe holly-leaved _Dilivaria,_ dwarf screw-pine (_Pandanus_), a shrub of\r\n_Compositæ,_ and a curious fern, a variety of _Aristichum aureum._\r\nTowards the northern end of Hattiah, Talipot, cocoa-nut and date-palms\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd we entered the Sunderbunds, rowing amongst narrow channels,\r\nwhere the tide rises but a few feet. The banks were covered with a\r\nluxuriant vegetation, chiefly of small trees, above which rose stately\r\npalms. On the 25th, we were overtaken by a steamer from Assam, a novel\r\nsight to us, and a very strange one in these creeks, which in some\r\nplaces seemed hardly broad enough for it to pass through. We jumped on\r\nboard in haste, leaving our boat and luggage to follow us. She had left\r\nDacca two days before, and this being the dry season, the route to\r\nCalcutta, which is but sixty miles in a straight line, involved a\r\ndétour of three hundred.\r\n\r\nFrom the masts of the steamer we obtained an excellent _coup-d’œil_ of\r\nthe Sunderbunds; its swamps clothed with verdure, and intersected by\r\ninnumerable inosculating channels, with banks a foot or so high. The\r\namount of tide, which never exceeds ten feet, diminishes in proceeding\r\nwestwards into the heart of these swamps, and the epoch, direction, and\r\nduration of the ebb and flow vary so much in every canal, that at\r\ntimes, after stemming a powerful current, we found ourselves, without\r\nmaterially changing our course, suddenly swept along with a favouring\r\nstream. This is owing to the complex ramifications of the creeks, the\r\nflow of whose waters is materially influenced by the most trifling\r\naccidents of direction.\r\n\r\nReceding from the Megna, the water became saltier, and _Nipa fruticans_\r\nappeared, throwing up pale yellow-green tufts of feathery leaves, from\r\na short thick creeping stem, and bearing at the base of the leaves its\r\ngreat head of nuts, of which millions were floating on the waters, and\r\nvegetating in the mud. Marks of tigers were very frequent, and the\r\nfootprints of deer, wild boars, and enormous crocodiles: these reptiles\r\nwere extremely common, and glided down the mud banks on the approach of\r\nthe steamer, leaving between the footmarks a deep groove in the mud\r\nmade by their tail. The _Phœnix paludosa,_ a dwarf slender-stemmed\r\ndate-palm, from six to eight feet high, is the all-prevalent feature,\r\ncovering the whole landscape with a carpet of feathery fronds of the\r\nliveliest green. The species is eminently gregarious, more so than any\r\nother Indian palm, and presents so dense a mass of foliage, that when\r\nseen from above, the stems are wholly hidden.[394]\r\n\r\n [394] _Sonneratia, Heritiera littoralis,_ and _Careya,_ form small\r\n gnarled trees on the banks, with deep shining green-leaved species of\r\n _Carallia Rhizophora,_ and other Mangroves. Occasionally the gigantic\r\n reed-mace (_Typha elephantina_) is seen, and tufts of tall reeds\r\n (_Arundo_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe water is very turbid, and only ten to twenty feet deep, which, we\r\nwere assured by the captain, was not increased during the rains: it is\r\nloaded with vegetable matter, but the banks are always muddy, and we\r\nnever saw any peat. Dense fogs prevented our progress in the morning,\r\nand we always anchored at dusk. We did not see a village or house in\r\nthe heart of the Sunderbunds (though such do occur), but we saw canoes,\r\nwith fishermen, who use the tame otter in fishing; and the banks were\r\ncovered with piles of firewood, stacked for the Calcutta market. As we\r\napproached the Hoogly, the water became very salt and clear; the Nipa\r\nfruits were still most abundant, floating out to sea, but no more of\r\nthe plant itself was seen. As the channels became broader, sand-flats\r\nappeared, with old salt factories, and clumps of planted _Casuarina._\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January we passed Saugor island, and entered the Hoogly,\r\nsteamed past Diamond Harbour, and landed at the Botanic Garden Ghat,\r\nwhere we received a hearty welcome from Dr. Falconer. Ten days later we\r\nbade farewell to India, reaching England on the 25th of March, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN BEHAR, AND IN THE VALLEYS OF THE SOANE\r\nAND GANGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the instruments which I employed were constructed by Mr.\r\nNewman, and with considerable care: they were in general accurate, and\r\nalways extremely well guarded, and put up in the most portable form,\r\nand that least likely to incur damage; they were further frequently\r\ncarefully compared by myself. These are points to which too little\r\nattention is paid by makers and by travellers in selecting instruments\r\nand their cases. This remark applies particularly to portable\r\nbarometers, of which I had five at various times. Although there are\r\nobvious defects in the system of adjustment, and in the method of\r\nobtaining the temperature of the mercury, I found that these\r\ninstruments invariably worked well, and were less liable to derangement\r\nand fracture than any I ever used; the best proof I can give of this is\r\nthat I preserved three uninjured during nearly all my excursions, left\r\ntwo in India, and brought a third home myself that had accompanied me\r\nalmost throughout my journey.\r\n\r\nIn very dry climates these and all other barometers are apt to leak,\r\nfrom the contraction of the box-wood plug through which the tube passes\r\ninto the cistern. This must, in portable barometers, in very dry\r\nweather, be kept moist with a sponge. A small iron bottle of pure\r\nmercury to supply leakage should be supplied with every barometer, as\r\nalso a turnscrew. The vernier plate and scale should be screwed, not\r\nsoldered on the metal sheath, as if an escape occurs in the\r\nbarometer-case the solder is acted upon at once. A table of corrections\r\nfor capacity and capillarity should accompany every instrument, and\r\nsimple directions, etc., in cases of trifling derangement, and\r\nalteration of neutral point.\r\n\r\nThe observations for temperature were taken with every precaution to\r\navoid radiation, and the thermometers were constantly compared with a\r\nstandard, and the errors allowed for. The maximum thermometer with a\r\nsteel index, I found to be extremely liable to derangement and very\r\ndifficult to re-adjust. Negretti’s maximum thermometer was not known to\r\nme during my journey. The spirit minimum thermometers again, are easily\r\nset to rights when out of order, but in every one (of six or seven)\r\nwhich I took to India, by several makers, the zero point receded, the\r\nerror in some increasing annually, even to –6° in two years. This seems\r\ndue to a vaporisation of the spirit within the tube. I have seen a\r\nthermometer of this description in India, of which the spirit seemed to\r\nhave retired wholly into the bulb, and which I was assured had never\r\nbeen injured. In wet-bulb observations, distilled water or rain, or\r\nsnow water was used, but I never found the result to differ from that\r\nobtained by any running fresh water, except such as was polluted to the\r\ntaste and eye.\r\n\r\nThe hours of observation selected were at first sunrise, 9 a.m., 3\r\np.m., sunset, and 9 p.m., according to the instructions issued to the\r\nAntarctic expedition by the Royal Society. In Sikkim, however, I\r\ngenerally adopted the hours appointed at the Surveyor General’s office,\r\nCalcutta; viz., sunrise, 9h. 50m. a.m., noon, 2h. 40m. p.m., 4 p.m.,\r\nand sunset, to which I added a 10 p.m. observation, besides many at\r\nintermediate hours as often as possible. Of these the 9h. 50m. a.m. and\r\n4 p.m. have been experimentally proved to be those of the maximum and\r\nminimum of atmospheric pressure at the level of the sea in India, and I\r\ndid not find any great or marked deviation from this at any height to\r\nwhich I attained, though at 15,000 or 16,000 feet the morning maximum\r\nmay occur rather earlier.\r\n\r\nThe observations for nocturnal (terrestrial) radiation were made by\r\nfreely suspending thermometers with naked bulbs, or by laying them on\r\nwhite cotton, wool, or flannel; also by means of a thermometer placed\r\nin the focus of a silvered parabolic reflector. I did not find that the\r\nreflector possessed any decided advantage over the white cotton: the\r\nmeans of a number of observations taken by each approximated closely,\r\nbut the difference between individual observations often amounted to\r\n2°.\r\n\r\nObservations again indicative of the radiation from grass, whether\r\ndewed or dry, are not strictly comparable; not only does the power of\r\nradiation vary with the species, but much more with the luxuriance and\r\nlength of the blades, with the situation, whether on a plane surface or\r\nraised, and with the subjacent soil. Of the great effect of the soil I\r\nhad frequent instances; similar tufts of the same species of grass\r\nradiating more powerfully on the dry sandy bed of the Soane, than on\r\nthe alluvium on its banks; the exposure being equal in both instances.\r\nExperiments for the surface-temperature of the soil itself, are least\r\nsatisfactory of any:—adjoining localities being no less affected by the\r\nnature, than by the state of disintegration of the surface, and by the\r\namount of vegetation in proximity to the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe power of the sun’s rays in India is so considerable, and protracted\r\nthrough so long a period of the day, that I did not find the\r\ntemperature of springs, or of running water, even of large deep rivers,\r\nso constant as was to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the earth was taken by sinking a brass tube a yard\r\nlong in the soil.\r\n\r\nA thermometer with the bulb blackened affords the only means the\r\ntraveller can generally compass, of measuring the power of the sun’s\r\nrays. It should be screened or put in a blackened box, or laid on black\r\nwool.\r\n\r\nA good Photometer being still a desideratum, I had recourse to the old\r\nwedge of coloured glass, of an uniform neutral tint, the distance\r\nbetween whose extremes, or between transparency and total opacity, was\r\none foot. A moveable arm carrying a brass plate with a slit and a\r\nvernier, enables the observer to read off at the vanishing point of the\r\nsun’s limb, to one five-hundredth of an inch. I generally took the mean\r\nof five readings as one, and the mean of five of these again I regarded\r\nas one observation; but I place little dependence upon the results. The\r\ncauses of error are quite obvious. As far as the effects of the sun’s\r\nlight on vegetation are concerned, I am inclined to think that it is of\r\nmore importance to register the number of hours or rather of parts of\r\neach hour, that the sun shines, and its clearness during the time. To\r\nsecure valuable results this should be done repeatedly, and the\r\nstrength of the rays by the black-bulb thermometer registered at each\r\nhour. The few actinometer observations will be found in another part of\r\nthe Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe dew-point has been calculated from the wet-bulb, by Dr. Apjohn’s\r\nformula, or, where the depression of the barometer is considerable, by\r\nthat as modified by Colonel Boileau.[395] The saturation-point was\r\nobtained by dividing the tension at the dew-point by that at the\r\nordinary temperature, and the weight of vapour, by Daniell’s formula.\r\n\r\n [395] Journal of Asiatic Society, No. 147 (1844), p.135.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following summary of meteorological observations is alluded to at\r\nvol. i., p. 15.\r\n\r\nI.—_Table-land of Birbhoom and Behar, from Taldanga to Dunwah. Average\r\nelevation 1,135 feet._\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these observations, that compared with Calcutta, the\r\ndryness of the atmosphere is the most remarkable feature of this\r\ntable-land, the temperature not being high; and to this, combined with\r\nthe sterility of the soil over a great part of the surface, must be\r\nattributed the want of a vigorous vegetation. Though so favourably\r\nexposed to the influence of nocturnal radiation, the amount of the\r\nlatter is small. The maximum depression of a thermometer laid on grass\r\nnever exceeded 10°, and averaged 7°; whereas the average depression of\r\nthe dew-point at the same hour amounted to 25° in the morning. Of\r\ncourse no dew was deposited even in the clearest star-light night.\r\n\r\n\r\n  February 1848 Hour Sunrise 9 a.m. 3 p.m. 9 p.m.\r\n  TEMPERATURE\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.\r\n    Min.\r\n    Range 56·6\r\n65·2\r\n46·3\r\n18·9 70·1\r\n77·0\r\n61·2\r\n15·8 75·5\r\n81·7\r\n65·2\r\n16·5 61·7\r\n66·2\r\n55·5\r\n10·7 WET-BULB\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.

From a comparison of the night and morning\r\nobservations of thermometers laid on grass, the earth, and freely\r\nexposed, it appears that the grass parts with its heat much more\r\nrapidly than the earth, but that still the effect of radiation is\r\nslight, lowering its temperature but 2° below that of the freely\r\nexposed thermometer.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the climate of Calcutta, these hills present a\r\nremarkable contrast, considering their proximity in position and\r\nmoderate elevation.\r\n\r\nThe difference of temperature between Calcutta and Birbhoom, deduced\r\nfrom the sunrise, morning and afternoon observations, amounts to 4°,\r\nwhich, if the mean height of the hills where crossed by the road, be\r\ncalled 1,135 feet, will be equal to a fall of one degree for every 288\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nIn the dampness of its atmosphere, Calcutta contrasts very remarkably\r\nwith these hills; the dew-point on the Hoogly averaging 51·3°, and on\r\nthese hills 38°, the corresponding saturation-points being 0·559 and\r\n0·380.\r\n\r\nThe difference between sunrise, forenoon and afternoon dew-points at\r\nCalcutta and on the hills, is 13·6° at each observation; but the\r\natmosphere at Calcutta is relatively drier in the afternoon than that\r\nof the hills; the difference between the Calcutta sunrise and afternoon\r\nsaturation-point being 0·449, and that between the hill sunrise and\r\nafternoon, 0·190. The march of the dew-point is thus the same in both\r\ninstances, but owing to the much higher temperature of Calcutta, and\r\nthe greatly increased tension of the vapour there, the relative\r\nhumidity varies greatly during the day.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the atmosphere of Calcutta is loaded with moisture in\r\nthe early morning of this season, and is relatively dry in the\r\nafternoon: in the hills again, it is scarcely more humid at sunrise\r\nthan at 3 p.m. That this dryness of the hills is partly due to\r\nelevation, appears from the disproportionately moister state of the\r\natmosphere below the Dunwah pass.\r\n\r\nII.—_Abstract of the Meteorological observationsctaken in the Soane\r\nValley\r\n(mean elevation 422 feet)._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference in mean temperature (partly owing to the sun’s more\r\nnortherly declination) amounts to 2·5° of increase in the Soane valley,\r\nabove that of the hills. The range of the thermometer from day to day\r\nwas considerably greater on the hills (though fewer observations were\r\nthere recorded): it amounted to 17·2° on the hills, and only 12·8° in\r\nthe valley. The range from the maximum to the minimum of each day\r\namounts to the same in both, above 20°. The extreme variations in\r\ntemperature too coincide within 1·4°.\r\n\r\nThe hygrometric state of the atmosphere of the valley differs most\r\ndecidedly from that of the hills. In the valley dew is constantly\r\nformed, which is owing to the amount of moisture in the air, for\r\nnocturnal radiation is more powerful on the hills. The sunrise and 9\r\np.m. observations in the valley, give a mean depression of the\r\ndew-point below the air of 12·3°, and those at the upper level of\r\n21·2°, with no dew on the hills and a copious deposit in the valley.\r\nThe corresponding state of the atmosphere as to saturation is 0·480 on\r\nthe hills and 0·626 in the valley.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the Soane valley is exposed to a less extreme\r\ntemperature than that of the hills; the difference between solar and\r\nnocturnal radiation amounting here only to 80·5°, and on the hills to\r\n96·5°. There is no material difference in the power of the sun’s rays\r\nat the upper and lower levels, as expressed by the blackbulb\r\nthermometer, the average rise of which above one placed in the shade,\r\namounted to 48° in both cases, and the maximum occurred about 11 a.m.\r\nThe decrease of the power of the sun’s rays in the afternoon is much\r\nthe most rapid in the valley, coinciding with a greater reduction of\r\nthe elasticity of vapour and of humidity in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe photometer observations show a greater degree of sun’s light on the\r\nhills than below, but there is not at either station a decided relation\r\nbetween the indications of this instrument and the black-bulb\r\nthermometer. From observations taken elsewhere, I am inclined to\r\nattribute the excess of solar light on the hills to their elevation;\r\nfor at a far greater elevation I have met with much stronger solar\r\nlight, in a very damp atmosphere, than I ever experienced in the drier\r\nplains of India. In a damp climate the greatest intensity may be\r\nexpected in the forenoon, when the vapour is diffused near the earth’s\r\nsurface; in the afternoon the lower strata of atmosphere are drier, but\r\nthe vapour is condensed into clouds aloft which more effectually\r\nobstruct the sun’s rays. On the Birbhoom and Behar hills, where the\r\namount of vapour is so small that the afternoon is but little drier\r\nthan the forenoon, there is little difference between the solar light\r\nat each time. In the Soane valley again, where a great deal of humidity\r\nis removed from the earth’s surface and suspended aloft, the\r\nobstruction of the sun’s light is very marked.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNWAH TO SOANE RIVER, AND UP SOANE TO TURA\r\n\r\n  February 10–19th Hour Sunrise 9 a.m. 3 p.m. 9 p.m.\r\n  TEMPERATURE\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.\r\n    Min.\r\n    Range 57·6\r\n62·0\r\n53·5\r\n  8·5 74·0\r\n81·0\r\n63·5\r\n17·5 77·6\r\n87·5\r\n71·0\r\n16·5 64·5\r\n68·7\r\n60·0\r\n  8·7 WET-BULB\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.

The mean temperature is much above that of\r\nthe lower parts of the same valley (below Tura), the excess amounting\r\nto 5.4°. The nights and mornings are cooler, by 1·2°, the days hotter\r\nby 10°. There were also 10° increase of range during the thirteen days\r\nspent there; and the mean range from day to day was nearly as great as\r\nit was on the hills of Bengal.\r\n\r\nThere being much exposed rock, and the valley being swept by violent\r\ndust-storms, the atmosphere is drier, the mean saturation point being\r\n·454, whereas in the lower part of the Soane’s course it was ·516.\r\n\r\nA remarkable uniformity prevails in the depression of thermometers\r\nexposed to nocturnal radiation, whether laid on the earth, grass, or\r\nfreely exposed; both the mean and maximum indication coincide very\r\nnearly with those of the lower Soane valley and of the hills. The\r\ntemperature of tufts of green barley laid on the ground is one degree\r\nhigher than that of short grass; _Argemone_ and _Calotropis_ leaves\r\nmaintain a still warmer temperature; from the previous experiments the\r\n_ Argemone_ appeared to be considerably the cooler, which I was\r\ninclined to attribute to the smoother and more shining surface of its\r\nleaf, but from these there would seem to be no sensible difference\r\nbetween the radiating powers of the two plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.—_TABLE-LAND OF KYMORE HILLS\r\n(Mean elev. 979 feet)_\r\n\r\n  February 20th to March 3rd Hour Sunrise 9 a.m. 3\r\n  p.m. 9 p.m. TEMPERATURE\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.\r\n    Min.\r\n    Range 65·3\r\n69·0\r\n57·5\r\n11·5 81·6\r\n83·5\r\n79·5\r\n  4·0 88·1\r\n90·0\r\n84·5\r\n  5·5 71·1\r\n76·0\r\n68·0\r\n  8·0 WET-BULB\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.

I can account\r\nfor this anomaly only on the supposition that the thick bed of\r\nalluvium, freely exposed to the sun (not clothed with jungle), absorbs\r\nthe sun’s rays and parts with its heat slowly. This is indicated by the\r\nincrease of temperature being due to the night and morning\r\nobservations, which are 3·1° and 8·5° higher here than below, whilst\r\nthe 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. temperatures are half a degree lower.\r\n\r\nThe variations of temperature too are all much less in amount, as are\r\nthose of the state of the atmosphere as to moisture, though the climate\r\nis rather damper.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of terrestrial radiation the paucity of the observations\r\nprecludes my dwelling. Between 9 p.m. and sunrise the following morning\r\nI found the earth to have lost but 6·5° of heat, whereas a mean of nine\r\nobservations at the same hours in the valley below indicated a loss of\r\n12°.\r\n\r\nThough the mean temperature deduced from the few days I spent on this\r\npart of the Kymore is so much above that of the upper Soane valley,\r\nwhich it bounds, I do not suppose that the whole hilly range partakes\r\nof this increase. When the alluvium does not cover the rock, as at\r\nRotas and many other places, especially along the southern and eastern\r\nridges of the ghats, the nights are considerably cooler than on the\r\nbanks of the Soane; and at Rotas itself, which rises almost\r\nperpendicularly from the river, and is exposed to no such radiation of\r\nheat from a heated soil as Shahgunj is, I found the temperature\r\nconsiderably below that of Akbarpore on the Soane, which however is\r\nmuch sheltered by an amphitheatre of rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.—_Mirzapore on the Ganges._\r\n\r\nDuring the few days spent at Mirzapore, I was surprised to find the\r\ntemperature of the day cooler by nearly 4° than that of the hills\r\nabove, or of the upper part of the Soane valley, while the nights on\r\nthe other hand were decidedly warmer. The dew-point was even lower in\r\nproportion, 7·6°, and the climate consequently drier. The following is\r\nan abstract of the observations taken at Mr. Hamilton’s house on the\r\nbanks of the Ganges (p. 363).\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that nocturnal radiation as registered at sunrise is\r\nmuch more powerful at Mirzapore than on the more exposed Kymore\r\nplateau; the depression of the thermometer freely exposed being 3°\r\ngreater, that laid on bare earth 6°, and that on the grass 1·4°\r\ngreater, on the banks of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nDuring my passage down the Ganges the rise of the dew-point was very\r\nsteady, the maximum occurring at the lowest point on the river,\r\nBhaugulpore, which, as compared with Mirzapore, showed an increase of\r\n8° in temperature, and of 30·6° in the rise of the dew-point. The\r\nsaturation-point at Mirzakore was ·331, and at the corresponding hours\r\nat Bhaugulpore ·742.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRZAPORE (Mean elev. 362 feet)\r\n\r\n  March 9th to 13th, 1848 Hour Sunrise 9 a.m. 3 p.m. 9\r\n  p.m. TEMPERATURE\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.\r\n    Min.\r\n    Range 61·1\r\n63·0\r\n58·0\r\n  5·0 76·1\r\n83·0\r\n71·0\r\n12·0 86·0\r\n--\r\n--\r\n-- 76·0\r\n--\r\n--\r\n-- WET-BULB\r\n    Mean\r\n    Max.

D. Thomson and the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, M.A., F.L.S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following remarks, for which I am indebted to the kindness of the\r\nable chemist and naturalist mentioned above, will be highly valued,\r\nboth by those who are interested in the many curious physiological\r\nquestions involved in the association of the most obscure forms of\r\nvegetable life with the remarkable phenomena of mineral springs; or in\r\nthe exquisitely beautiful microscopic structure of the lower Algæ,\r\nwhich has thrown so much light upon a branch of natural history, whose\r\ndomain, like that of astronomy, lies to a great extent beyond the reach\r\nof the unassisted eye.—J.D.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Mineral water, Soorujkoond, Behar (vol. i., p. 27), contains\r\nchloride of sodium and sulphate of soda.\r\n\r\n2. Mineral water, hot springs, Yeumtong, altitude 11,730 feet (see vol.\r\nii., p. 117). Disengages sulphuretted hydrogen when fresh.—This water\r\nwas inodorous when the bottle was opened. The saline matter in solution\r\nwas considerably less than in the Soorujkoond water, but like that\r\nconsisted of chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda. Its alkaline\r\ncharacter suggests the probability of its containing carbonate of soda,\r\nbut none was detected. The rocks decomposed by the waters of the spring\r\nconsist of granite impregnated with sulphate of alumina. It appears\r\nthat in this case the sulphurous waters of Yeumtong became impregnated\r\nin the air with sulphuric acid, which decomposed the felspar,[397] and\r\nunited with its alumina. I found traces only of potash in the salt.\r\n\r\n [397] I have, in my journal, particularly alluded to the garnets (an\r\n aluminous mineral) being thus entirely decomposed.—J.D.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen waters appear to give origin to sulphuric acid,\r\nwhen the water impregnated with the gas reaches the surface; and I have\r\nfine fibrous specimens of sulphate of lime accompanied with sulphur,\r\nfrom the hot springs of Pugha in west Tibet, brought by Dr. T. Thomson.\r\n\r\n3. Mineral water, Momay hot springs, (vol. ii., p. 133).—When the\r\nbottle was uncorked, a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen was\r\nperceived. The water contains about twenty-five grains per imp. gallon,\r\nof chloride of sodium, sulphate and carbonate of soda; the reaction\r\nbeing strongly alkaline when the solution was concentrated.\r\n\r\n4. Effloresced earth from Behar (vol. i., p. 13), consists of granite\r\nsand, mixed with sesquicarbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_On the Indian Algæ which occur principally in different parts of the\r\nHimalayan Range, in the hot-springs of Soorujkoond in Bengal, Pugha in\r\nTibet, and Momay in Sikkim; and on the Fungi of the Himalayas._ By the\r\nRev. M. J. Berkeley, M.A.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention in the present appendix to give specific\r\ncharacters or even accurately determined specific names to the\r\ndifferent objects within its scope, which have come under\r\ninvestigation, as collected by Dr. Hooker and Dr. Thomson. To do so\r\nwould require far more time than I have at present been able to devote\r\nto the subject, for though every species has been examined\r\nmicroscopically, either by myself or Mr. Broome, and working sketches\r\nsecured at the same time, the specific determination of fresh water\r\nAlgæ from Herbarium specimens is a matter which requires a very long\r\nand accurate comparison of samples from every available locality, and\r\nin the case of such genera as _Zygnema, Tyndaridea,_ and _Conferva,_\r\nis, after all, not a very satisfactory process.\r\n\r\nThe object in view is merely to give some general notion of the forms\r\nwhich presented themselves in the vast districts visited by the\r\nabove-mentioned botanists, comprising localities of the greatest\r\npossible difference as regards both temperature and elevation; but more\r\nespecially in the hot-springs which occur in two distant parts of the\r\nHimalayas and in Behar, and these again under very different degrees of\r\nelevation and of extrinsic temperature.\r\n\r\nThe Algæ from lower localities are but few in number, and some of these\r\nof very common forms. We have for instance from the Ganges, opposite\r\nBijnour, a _ Batrachospermum_ and _Conferva crispata,_ the former\r\npurple below, with specimens of _Chantransia,_ exactly as they might\r\noccur in the Thames. The _Conferva,_ or more properly _ Cladophora,_\r\nwhich occurs also under various forms, at higher elevations, as in the\r\nneighbourhood of Simla and Iskardo, swarms with little parasites, but\r\nof common or uninteresting species. In the Bijnour specimens, these\r\nconsist of common forms of _Synedra, Meridion circulare,_ and a\r\n_Cymbella,_ on others from Dacca, there are about three species of\r\n_Synedra,_[398] a minute _Navicula_ and _Gomphonema curvatum._ Nothing,\r\nin fact, can well be more European. One splendid Alga, however, occurs\r\nat Fitcoree, in Behar, on the banks of nullahs, which are dry in hot\r\nweather, forming a purple fleece of coarse woolly hairs, which are\r\nsingularly compressed, and of extreme beauty under the microscope, from\r\nthe crystalline green of the articulated string which threads the\r\nbright red investing sheath. This curious Alga calls to mind in its\r\ncolouring _Cænocoleus Smithii,_ figured in English Botany, t. 2940, but\r\nit has not the common sheath of that Alga, and is on a far larger\r\nscale. One or two other allied forms, or species, occur in East Nepal,\r\nto which I purpose giving, together with the Behar plant, the generic\r\nname of _Erythronema._ From the Soane River, also, is an interesting\r\nAlga, belonging to the curious genus _Thwaitesia,_ in which the\r\ndivision of the endochrome in the fertile cells into four distinct\r\nmasses, sometimes entirely free, is beautifully marked. In some cases,\r\nindeed, instead of the ordinary spores, the whole moss is broken up\r\ninto numerous bodies, as in the fertile joints of _Ulothrix,_ and\r\nprobably, as in that case, the resultant corpuscles are endowed with\r\nactive motion. In Silhet, again, is a magnificent _ Zygnema,_ allied to\r\n_Z. nitidum,_ with large oval spores, about 1/285 part of an inch long,\r\nand a dark golden brown colour, and containing a spiral green\r\nendochrome.\r\n\r\n [398] Two of these appear to be _S. Vaucheriæ_ and _S. inæqualis._\r\n\r\nLeaving, however, the lower parts of India, I shall first take the\r\nspecies which occur in Khasia, Sikkim, Eastern Nepal, and the adjoining\r\nparts of Tibet.\r\n\r\nIn the hot valleys of the Gtreat Rungeet, at an elevation of about 2000\r\nfeet, we have the _Erythronema,_ but under a slightly different form;\r\nat Nunklow, at about the same height; in Khasia, again, at twice that\r\nelevation; in Eastern Nepal, at 12,000; and, finally, at Momay,\r\nreaching up to 16,000 feet. In water, highly impregnated with oxide of\r\niron, at 4000 feet in Sikkim, a _Leptothrix_ occurred in great\r\nabundance, coloured with the oxide, exactly as is the case with Algæ\r\nwhich grow in iron springs in Europe. At elevations between 5000 and\r\n7000 feet, several European forms occur, consisting of _ Ulothrix,\r\nZygnema, Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, Sphærozyga, Scytonema, Conferva,_ and\r\n_Cladophora._ The species may indeed not be identical with European\r\nspecies, but they are all more or less closely allied to well-known\r\nHydrophytes. One very interesting form, however, either belonging to\r\nthe genus _ Zygnema,_ or possibly constituting a distinct genus, occurs\r\nin streams at 5000 feet in Sikkim, consisting of highly gelatinous\r\nthreads of the normal structure of the _Zygnema,_ but forming a\r\nreticulated mass. The threads adhere to each other laterally,\r\ncontaining only a single spiral endochrome, and the articulations are\r\nvery long. Amongst the threads are mixed those of some species of\r\n_Tyndaridea._ There is also a curious _Hormosiphon,_ at a height of\r\n7000 feet; forming anastomosing gelatinous masses. A fine new species\r\nof _Lyngbya_ extends up as high as 11,000 feet. At 13,000 feet occurs\r\neither some simple _Conferva_ or _Zygnema,_ it is doubtful which from\r\nthe condition of the specimens; and at the same elevation, in the\r\nnearly dry bed of the stream which flows from the larger lake at Momay,\r\namongst flat cakes, consisting of felspathic silt from the glaciers\r\nabove, and the débris of Algæ, and abounding in Diatomaceæ, some\r\nthreads of a _Zygnema._ At 17,000 feet, an _ Oscillatoria,_ attached or\r\nadherent to _Zannichellia_; and, finally, on the bare ground, at 18,000\r\nfeet, on the Donkia mountains, an obscure species of _Cænocoleus._ On\r\nthe surface of the glaciers at Kinchinjhow, on silt, there is a curious\r\n_Palmella,_ apparently quite distinct from any European form.\r\n\r\nAmongst the greater part of the Algæ, from 4000 feet to 18,000 feet,\r\nvarious Diatomaceæ occur, which will be best noticed in a tabular form,\r\nas follows; the specific name, within brackets, merely indicating the\r\nspecies to which they bear most resemblance:—\r\n\r\nHimantidium (_Soleirolii_)\r\nOdontidium (_hiemale,_ forma minor)\r\nEpithemia, _n. sp._\r\nCymbella\r\nNavicula, _n. sp._\r\nTabillaria (_flocculosa_\r\nOdontidium (_hiemale_)\r\nHimantidium\r\nOdontidium (_turgidulum_)\r\nEpithemia (_ocellata_)\r\nFragillaria\r\nOdontidium (_turgidulum_)\r\nDictyocha (_gracilis_)\r\nOdontidium (_hiemale_) 4000 to 7000 feet\r\n5000 to 7000 feet\r\n7000 feet\r\n  —\r\n  —\r\n6000 to 7000 feet\r\n11,000 feet\r\n16,000 feet\r\n17,000 feet\r\n  —\r\n18,000 feet\r\n  —\r\n  —\r\n  — Sikkim\r\nSikkim\r\nSikkim\r\nSikkim\r\nSikkim\r\nSikkim\r\nSikkim\r\nMomay\r\nMomay\r\nTibet\r\nMomay\r\nMomay\r\nMomay\r\nKinchinjhow\r\n\r\nWe now turn to those portions of Tibet or the neighbouring regions,\r\nexplored by Dr. Thomson and Captain Strachey. The principal feature in\r\nthe Algology is the great prevalence of species of _Zygnema_ and\r\n_Tyndaridea,_ which occur under a variety of forms, sometimes with very\r\nthick gelatinous coats. In not a single instance, however, is there the\r\nslightest tendency to produce fructification. _Conferva crispata_\r\nagain, as mentioned above, occurs in several localities; and in one\r\nlocality a beautiful unbranched _Conferva,_ with torulose\r\narticulations. At Iskardo, Dr. Thomson gathered a very gelatinous\r\nspecies of _Draparnaldia,_ or more properly, a _ Stygeoclonium,_ if we\r\nmay judge from a little conglomeration of cells which appeared amongst\r\nthe threads. A _Tetraspora_ in Piti, an obscure _Tolypothrix,_ and one\r\nor two _ Oscillatoriæ,_ remarkable for their interrupted mode of\r\ngrowth, complete the list of Algæ, with the exception of one, to be\r\nmentioned presently; as also of _Diatomaceæ,_ and of the species of\r\n_Nostoc_ and _Hormosiphon,_ which occurred in great profusion, and\r\nunder several forms, sometimes attaining a very large size (several\r\ninches across), especially in the districts of Le and Piti, and where\r\nthe soil or waters were impregnated with saline matters. It is well\r\nknown that some species of _Nostoc_ form an article of food in China,\r\nand one was used for that purpose in a late Arctic expedition, as\r\nreported by Dr. Sutherland; but it does not seem that any use is made\r\nof them in Tibet, though probably all the large species would form\r\ntolerable articles of food, and certainly, from their chemical\r\ncomposition, prove very nutritious. One species is mentioned by Dr.\r\nThomson as floating, without any attachment, in the shallow water of\r\nthe pools scattered over the plains, on the Parang River, separated\r\nonly by a ridge of mountains from Piti, broad and foliaceous, and\r\nscarcely different from the common _ Nostoc,_ which occurs in all parts\r\nof the globe. I must not, however, neglect to record a very singular\r\nnew genus, in which the young threads have the characters of\r\n_Tyndaridea,_ but, after a time, little swellings occur on their sides,\r\nin which a distinct endochrome is formed, extending backwards into the\r\nparent endochrome, separated from it by a well defined membrane, and\r\nproducing, either by repeated pullulation, a compound mass like that of\r\n_Calothrix,_ or simply giving rise to a forked thread. In the latter\r\ncase, however, there is no external swelling, but a lateral endochrome\r\nis formed, which, as it grows, makes its way through an aperture, whose\r\nsides are regularly inflected. I have given to this curious production\r\nthe name of _Cladozygia Thomsoni._\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above Algæ occurred at heights varying from 10,000 to\r\n15,500 feet. As in the Southern Himalayan Algæ, the specimens were\r\ninfested with many Diatomaceæ, amongst which the most conspicuous were\r\nvarious _Cymbellæ_ and _Epithemiæ._ The following is a list of the\r\nspecies observed.\r\n\r\nCymbella (_gastroides_).\r\n Cymbella (_gracilis_).\r\nCymbella (_Ehrenbergii_)\r\n    and three others.\r\nOdontidium (_hiemale_).\r\nOdontidium (_mesodon_).\r\nOdontidium _n. sp._\r\nEpithemia _n. sp._\r\nSynedra (_arcus_).\r\nSynedra (_tenuis_).\r\nSynedra (_æqualis_).\r\nDenticula (_obtusa_).\r\nGomphonema (_abbreviatum_).\r\nMeridion circulare.\r\n\r\nThere is very little identity between this list and that before given\r\nfrom the Southern Himalayas, as is the case also with the other Algæ.\r\nTill the species, however, have been more completely studied, a very\r\naccurate comparison cannot be made.\r\n\r\nIn both instances the species which grow in hot springs have been\r\nreserved in order to make their comparison more easy. I shall begin in\r\nan inverse order, with those of the springs of Pugha in Tibet, which\r\nattain a temperature of 174°. Two _ Confervæ_ only occur in the\r\nspecimens which have been preserved, viz., an _Oscillatoria_ allied to\r\nthat which I have called _O. interrupta,_ and a true _Conferva_\r\nextremely delicate with very long articulations, singularly swollen at\r\nthe commissures. The _Diatomaceæ_ are:—\r\n\r\nOdontidium (_hiemale_).\r\nOdontidium (_mesodon_).\r\nOdontidium _n. sp.,_ same as at Piti on _Conferva._\r\nDenticula (_obtusa_).\r\nNavicula.\r\nCymbella, three species.\r\nEpithemia.\r\n\r\nScarcely any one of these except the _Navicula_ is peculiar to the\r\nlocality. A fragment apparently of some _ Closterium,_ the only one\r\nwhich I have met with in the collection, accompanies one of the\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nThe hot springs of Momay, (temp. 110°) at 16,000 feet, produce a golden\r\nbrown _Cænocoleus_ representing a small form of _C. cirrhosus,_ and a\r\nvery delicate _ Sphærozyga,_ an _Anabaina,_ and _Tolypothrix_; and at\r\n17,000 feet, a delicate green _Conferva_ with long even articulations.\r\nWith the latter is an _Odontidium_ allied to, or identical with _O.\r\nturgidulum,_ and with the former a fine species of _Epithemia_\r\nresembling in form, but not in marking, _E. Faba, E. (Zebra)_ a fine\r\n_Navicula,_ perhaps the same with _N. major_ and _Fragilaria\r\n(virescens)._[399] In mud from one of the Momay springs (_a_), I\r\ndetected _Epithemia (Broomeii n.s.),_ and two small _Naviculæ,_ and in\r\nthe spring (_c_) two species of _Epithemia_ somewhat like _E. Faba,_\r\nbut different from that mentioned above.\r\n\r\n [399] Mr. Thomas Brightwell finds in a portion of the same specimen\r\n _Epithemia alpestris, Surirella splendida, S. linearis,_ Smith,\r\n _Pinnularia viridis,_ Smith, _Navicula (lanceolata)_ and _Himantidium\r\n (arcus)._\r\n\r\nThe hot springs of Soorujkoond, of the vegetation of which very\r\nnumerous specimens have been preserved, are extremely poor in species.\r\nIn the springs themselves and on their banks, at temperatures varying\r\nfrom 80° to 158°, at which point vegetation entirely ceases, a minute\r\n_Leptothrix_ abounds everywhere, varying a little in the regularity of\r\nthe threads in different specimens, but scarcely presenting two\r\nspecies. Between 84° and 112° there is an imperfect _Zygnema_ with very\r\nlong articulations, and where the green scum passes into brown, there\r\nis sometimes an _Oscillatoria,_ of a very minute stellate _Scytonema,_\r\nprobably in an imperfect state. _ Epithemia ocellata_ also contributes\r\noften to produce the tint. An _Anabaina_ occurs at a temperature of\r\n125°, but the same species was found also in the stream from the\r\nsprings where the water had become cold, as was also the case with the\r\n_ Zygnema._\r\n\r\nThe Diatomaceæ consisted of:—\r\n\r\nEpithemia Broomeii, _n. s._\r\nEpithemia thermalis, _n. sp._\r\nEpithemia inæqualis, _n. sp._\r\nNavicula Beharensis, _n. sp._\r\n\r\nThe vegetation in the three sets of springs was very different. As\r\nregards the _Confervæ,_ taking the word in its older sense, the species\r\nin the three are quite different, and even in respect of genera there\r\nis little identity, but amongst the _Diatomaceæ_ there is no striking\r\ndifference, except in those of the Behar springs where three out of the\r\nfour did not occur elsewhere. In the Pugha and Momay springs, the\r\nspecies were either identical with, or nearly allied to those found in\r\nneighbouring localities, where the water did not exceed the ordinary\r\ntemperature. A longer examination will doubtless detect more numerous\r\nforms, but those which appear on a first examination are sure to give a\r\npretty correct general notion of the vegetation. The species are\r\ncertainly less numerous than I had expected, or than might be supposed\r\nfrom the vegetation of those European hot springs which have been most\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I shall beg to add a few words on the Fungi of the\r\nHimalayas, so far as they have at present been investigated. As regards\r\nthese there is a marked difference, as might be anticipated from the\r\nnature of the climates between those parts of Tibet investigated by Dr.\r\nThomson, and the more southern regions. The fungi found by Dr. Thomson\r\nwere but few in number, and for the most part of very ordinary forms,\r\ndiffering but little from the produce of an European wood. Some,\r\nhowever, grow to a very large size, as for instance, _Polyporus\r\nfomentarius_ on poplars near Iskardo, exceeding in dimensions anything\r\nwhich this species exhibits in Europe. A very fine _Æcidium_ also\r\ninfests the fir trees (_Abies Smithiana_), a figure of which has been\r\ngiven in the “Gardeners’ Chronicle,” 1852, p. 627, under the name of\r\n_Æcidium Thomsoni._ This is allied to the Hexenbesen of the German\r\nforests, but is a finer species and quite distinct. _Polyporus\r\noblectans, Geaster limbatus, Geaster mammosus, Erysiphe taurica,_ a\r\n_Boletus_ infested with _Sepedonium mycophilum, Scleroderma\r\nverrucosum,_ an _Æcidium,_ and a _Uromyces,_ both on _Mulgedium\r\nTataricum,_ about half-a-dozen Agarics, one at an altitude of 16,000\r\nfeet above the Nubra river, a _Lycoperdon,_ and _ Morchella\r\nsemilibera,_ which is eaten in Kashmir, and exported when dry to the\r\nplains of India, make up the list of fungi.\r\n\r\nThe region of Sikkim is perhaps the most productive in fleshy fungi of\r\nany in the world, both as regards numbers and species, and Eastern\r\nNepal and Khasia yield also an abundant harvest. The forms are for the\r\nmost part European, though the species are scarcely ever quite\r\nidentical. The dimensions of many are truly gigantic, and many species\r\nafford abundant food to the natives. Mixed with European forms a few\r\nmore decidedly tropical occur, and amongst those of East Nepal is a\r\n_Lentinus_ which has the curious property of staining every thing which\r\ntouches it of a deep rhubarb yellow, and is not exceeded in\r\nmagnificence by any tropical species. The _Polypori_ are often\r\nidentical with those of Java, Ceylon, and the Philippine Isles, and the\r\ncurious _Trichocoma paradoxum_ which was first found by Junghuhn in\r\nJava, and very recently by Dr. Harvey in Ceylon, occurs abundantly on\r\nthe decayed trunks of laurels, as it does in South Carolina. The\r\ncurious genus _Mitremyces_ also is scattered here and there, though not\r\nunder the American form, but that which occurs in Java. Though\r\n_Hymenomycetes_ are so abundant, the _ Discomycetes_ and _Ascomycetes_\r\nare comparatively rare, and very few species indeed of _Sphœria_ were\r\ngathered. One curious matter is, that amongst the very extensive\r\ncollections which have been made there is scarcely a single new genus.\r\nThe species moreover in Sikkim are quite different, except in the case\r\nof some more or less cosmopolite species from those of Eastern Nepal\r\nand Khasia: scarcely a single _Lactarius_ or _ Cortinarius_ for\r\ninstance occurs in Sikkim, though there are several in Khasia. The\r\ngenus _Boletus_ through the whole district assumes the most magnificent\r\nforms, which are generally very different from anything in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nON THE SOILS OF SIKKIM.\r\n\r\nThere is little variety in the soil throughout Sikkim, and, as far as\r\nvegetation is concerned, it may be divided into vegetable mould and\r\nstiff clay—each, as they usually occur, remarkably characteristic in\r\ncomposition of such soils. Bog-earth is very rare, nor did I find peat\r\nat any elevation.\r\n\r\nThe clay is uniformly of great tenacity, and is, I believe, wholly due\r\nto the effect of the atmosphere on crumbling gneiss and other rocks. It\r\nmakes excellent bricks, is tenacious, seldom friable, and sometimes\r\naccumulated in beds fourteen feet thick, although more generally only\r\nabout two feet. In certain localities, beds or narrow seams of pure\r\nfelspathic clay and layers of vegetable matter occur in it, probably\r\nwholly due to local causes. An analysis of that near Dorjiling gives\r\nabout 30 per cent. of alumina, the rest being silica, and a fraction of\r\noxide of iron. Lime is wholly unknown as a constituent of the soil, and\r\nonly occasionally seen as a stalactitic deposit from a few springs.\r\n\r\nA layer of vegetable earth almost invariably covers the clay to the\r\ndepth of from three to twelve or fourteen inches. It is a very rich\r\nblack mould, held in its position on the slopes of the hills by the\r\ndense vegetation, and accumulated on the banks of small streams to a\r\ndepth at times of three and four feet. The following is an analysis of\r\nan average specimen of the surface-soil of Dorjiling, made for me by my\r\nfriend C. J. Muller, Esq., of that place:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._—DRY EARTH\r\n\r\nAnhydrous\r\nWater 83·84\r\n16·16\r\n————\r\n100·00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._—ANHYDROUS EARTH\r\n\r\nHumic acid\r\nHumine\r\nUndecomposed vegetable matter\r\nPeroxide of iron and manganese\r\nAlumina\r\nSiliceous matter, insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid\r\nTraces of soda and muriatic acid 3·89\r\n4·61\r\n20·98\r\n7·05\r\n8·95\r\n54·52\r\n--\r\n————\r\n100·00\r\n\r\n_c._—Soluble in water, gr. 1·26 per cent., consisting of soda, muriatic\r\nacid, organic matter, and silica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil from which this example was taken was twelve inches deep; it\r\nabounded to the eye in vegetable matter, and was siliceous to the\r\ntouch. There were no traces of phosphates or of animal matter, and\r\ndoubtful traces of lime and potash. The subsoil of clay gave only 5·7\r\nper cent. of water, and 5·55 of organic matter. The above analysis was\r\nconducted during the rainy month of September, and the sample is an\r\naverage one of the surface-soil at 6000 to 10,000 feet. There is, I\r\nthink, little difference anywhere in the soils at this elevation,\r\nexcept where the rock is remarkably micaceous, or where veins of\r\nfelspathic granite, by their decomposition, give rise to small beds of\r\nkaolin.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\r\n(Vol. i., p. 37)\r\n\r\n AN AURORA SEEN FROM BAROON ON THE EAST BANK\r\nOF THE SOANE RIVER.\r\n Lat. 24° 52′ N.; Long. 84° 22′ E.; Alt. 345 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following appearances are as noted in my journal at the time. They\r\nso entirely resembled auroral beams, that I had no hesitation in\r\npronouncing them at the time to be such. This opinion has, however,\r\nbeen dissented from by some meteorologists, who consider that certain\r\nfacts connected with the geographical distribution of auroras (if I may\r\nuse the term), are opposed to it. I am well aware of the force of these\r\narguments, which I shall not attempt to controvert; but for the\r\ninformation of those who may be interested in the matter, I may remark,\r\nthat I am very familiar with the Aurora borealis in the northern\r\ntemperate zone, and during the Antarctic expedition was in the habit of\r\nrecording in the log-book the appearance presented by the Aurora\r\naustralis. The late Mr. Williams, Mr. Haddon, and Mr. Theobald, who\r\nwere also witnesses of the appearances on this occasion, considered it\r\na brilliant display of the aurora.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 14th,_ 9 p.m.—Bax. Corr. 29·751; temp. 62°; D.P. 41·0°; calm, sky\r\nclear; moon three-quarters full, and bright.\r\n\r\nObserved about thirty lancet beams rising in the north-west from a low\r\nluminous arch, whose extremes bore W. 20° S., and N. 50° E.; altitude\r\nof upper limb of arch 20°, of the lower 8°. The beams crossed the\r\nzenith, and converged towards S. 15° E. The extremity of the largest\r\nwas forked, and extended to 25° above the horizon in the S.E. by S.\r\nquarter. The extremity of the centre one bore S. 50° E., and was 45°\r\nabove the horizon. The western beams approached nearest the southern\r\nhorizon. All the beams moved and flashed slowly, occasionally splitting\r\nand forking, fading and brightening; they were brightly defined, though\r\nthe milky way and zodiacal light could not be discerned, and the stars\r\nand planets, though clearly discernible, were very pale.\r\n\r\nAt 10 p.m., the luminous appearance was more diffused; upper limb of\r\nthe arch less defined; no beams crossed the zenith; but occasionally\r\nbeams appeared there and faded away.\r\n\r\nBetween 10 and 11, the beams continued to move and replace one another,\r\nas usual in auroras, but disappeared from the south-east quarter, and\r\nbecame broader in the northern hemisphere; the longest beams were near\r\nthe north and north-east horizon.\r\n\r\nAt half-past 10, a dark belt, 4° broad, appeared in the luminous arch,\r\nbearing from N. 55° W. to N. 10° W.; its upper limb was 10° above the\r\nhorizon: it then gradually dilated, and thus appeared to break up the\r\narch. This appeared to be the commencement of the dispersion of the\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nAt 10.50 p.m. the dark band had increased so much in breadth that the\r\narch was broken up in the north-west, and no beams appeared there.\r\nEighteen linear beams rose from the eastern part of the arch, and bore\r\nfrom north to N. 20° E.\r\n\r\nTowards 11 p.m., the dark band appeared to have replaced the luminous\r\narch; the beams were all but gone, a few fragments appearing in the\r\nN.E. A southerly wind sprang up, and a diffused light extended along\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, I saw two faint beams to the north-east, and two well\r\ndefined parallel ones in the south-west.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE SIKKIM HIMALAYA, EAST NEPAL,\r\nAND ADJACENT PROVINCES OF TIBET.\r\n\r\nSikkim is included in a section of the Himalaya, about sixty miles\r\nbroad from east to west, where it is bounded respectively by the\r\nmountain states of Bhotan and Nepal. Its southern limits are easily\r\ndefined, for the mountains rise abruptly from the plains of Bengal, as\r\nspurs of 6000 to 10,000 feet high, densely clothed with forest to their\r\nsummits. The northern and north-eastern frontier of Sikkim is beyond\r\nthe region of much rain, and is not a natural, but a political line,\r\ndrawn between that country and Tibet. Sikkim lies nearly due north of\r\nCalcutta, and only four hundred miles from the Bay of Bengal; its\r\nlatitude being 26° 40′ to 28° N., and longitude 88° to 89° E.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Sikkim are Kinchinjunga, the loftiest hitherto\r\nmeasured mountain, which lies to its north-west, and rises 28,178 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea; and the Teesta river, which flows\r\nthroughout the length of the country, and has a course of upwards of\r\nninety miles in a straight line. Almost all the sources of the Teesta\r\nare included in Sikkim; and except some comparatively insignificant\r\nstreams draining the outermost ranges, there are no rivers in this\r\ncountry but itself and its feeders, which occupy the largest of the\r\nHimalayan valleys between the Tambur in East Nepal, and the Machoo in\r\nWestern Bhotan.\r\n\r\nAn immense spur, sixty miles long, stretches south from Kinchin to the\r\nplains of India; it is called Singalelah, and separates Sikkim from\r\nEast Nepal; the waters from its west flank flow into the Tambur, and\r\nthose from the east into the Great Rungeet, a feeder of the Teesta.\r\nBetween these two latter rivers is a second spur from Kinchinjunga,\r\nterminating in Tendong.\r\n\r\nThe eastern boundary of Sikkim, separating it from Bhotan, is formed\r\nfor the greater part by the Chola range, which stretches south from the\r\nimmense mountain of Donkia, 23,176 feet high, situated fifty miles\r\nE.N.E. of Kinchinjunga: where the frontier approaches the plains of\r\nIndia, the boundary line follows the course of the Teesta, and of the\r\nRinkpo, one of its feeders, flowing from the Chola range. This range is\r\nmuch more lofty than that of Singalelah, and the drainage from its\r\neastern flank is into the Machoo river, the upper part of whose course\r\nis in Tibet, and the lower in Bhotan.\r\n\r\nThe Donkia mountain, though 4000 feet lower than Kinchin, is the\r\nculminant point of a much more extensive and elevated mountain mass. It\r\nthrows off an immense spur from its north-west face, which runs west,\r\nand then south-west, to Kinchin, forming the watershed of all the\r\nremote sources of the Teesta. This spur has a mean elevation of 18,000\r\nto 19,000 feet, and several of its peaks (of which Chomiomo is one)\r\nrise much higher. The northern boundary of Sikkim is not drawn along\r\nthis, but runs due west from Donkia, following a shorter, but\r\nstupendous spur, called Kinchinjhow; whence it crosses the Teesta to\r\nChomiomo, and is continued onwards to Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nThough the great spur connecting Donkia with Kinchin is in Tibet, and\r\nbounds the waters that flow directly south into the Teesta, it is far\r\nfrom the true Himalayan axis, for the rivers that rise on its northern\r\nslope do not run into the valley of the Tsampu, or Tibetan\r\nBurrampooter, but into the Arun of Nepal, which rises to the north of\r\nDonkia, and flows south-west for many miles in Tibet, before entering\r\nNepal and flowing south to the Ganges.\r\n\r\nSikkim, thus circumscribed, consists of a mass of mountainous spurs,\r\nforest-clad up to 12,000 feet; there are no flat valleys or plains in\r\nthe whole country, no lakes or precipices of any consequence below that\r\nelevation, and few or no bare slopes, though the latter are uniformly\r\nsteep. The aspect of Sikkim can only be understood by a reference to\r\nits climate and vegetation, and I shall therefore take these together,\r\nand endeavour, by connecting these phenomena, to give an intelligible\r\nview of the main features of the whole country.[400]\r\n\r\n [400] This I did with reference especially to the cultivation of\r\n Rhododendrons, in a paper which the Horticultural Society of London\r\n did me the honour of printing. Quarterly Journ. of Hort. Soc., vol.\r\n vii., p. 82.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the country between Sikkim and the sea is a dead\r\nlevel, occupied by the delta of the Ganges and Burrampooter, above\r\nwhich the slope is so gradual to the base of the mountains, that the\r\nsurface of the plain from which the Himalayas immediately rise is only\r\n300 feet above the sea. The most obvious effect of this position is,\r\nthat the prevailing southerly wind reaches the first range of hills,\r\nloaded with vapour. The same current, when deflected easterly to\r\nBhotan, or westerly to Nepal and the north-west Himalaya, is\r\nintercepted and drained of much moisture, by the Khasia and Garrow\r\nmountains (south of Assam and the Burrampooter) in the former case, and\r\nthe Rajmahal hills (south of the Ganges) in the latter. Sikkim is hence\r\nthe dampest region of the whole Himalaya.\r\n\r\nViewed from a distance on the plains of India, Sikkim presents the\r\nappearance—common to all mountainous countries—of consecutive parallel\r\nridges, running east and west: these are all wooded, and backed by a\r\nbeautiful range of snowy peaks, with occasional breaks in the foremost\r\nranges, through which the rivers debouch. Any view of the Himalaya,\r\nespecially at a sufficient distance for the remote snowy peaks to be\r\nseen overtopping the outer ridges, is, however, rare, from the constant\r\ndeposition of vapours over the forest-clad ranges during the greater\r\npart of the year, and the haziness of the dry atmosphere of the plains\r\nin the winter months. At the end of the rains, when the south-east\r\nmonsoon has ceased to blow with constancy, views are obtained,\r\nsometimes from a distance of nearly two hundred miles. From the plains,\r\nthe highest peaks subtend so small an angle, that they appear like\r\nwhite specks very low on the horizon, tipping the black lower and outer\r\nwooded ranges, which always rise out of a belt of haze, and from the\r\ndensity, probably, of the lower strata of atmosphere, are never seen to\r\nrest on the visible horizon. The remarkable lowness on the horizon of\r\nthe whole stupendous mass is always a disappointing feature to the new\r\ncomer, who expects to see dazzling peaks towering in the air.\r\nApproaching nearer, the snowy mountains sink behind the wooded ones,\r\nlong before the latter have assumed gigantic proportions; and when they\r\ndo so, they appear a sombre, lurid grey-green mass of vegetation, with\r\nno brightness or variation of colour. There is no break in this forest\r\ncaused by rock, precipices, or cultivation; some spurs project nearer,\r\nand some valleys appear to retire further into the heart of the\r\nforemost great chain that shuts out all the country beyond.\r\n\r\nFrom Dorjiling the appearance of parallel ridges is found to be\r\ndeceptive, and due to the inosculating spurs of long tortuous ranges\r\nthat ran north and south throughout the whole length of Sikkim,\r\ndividing deep wooded valleys, which form the beds of large rivers. The\r\nsnowy peaks here look like a long east and west range of mountains, at\r\nan average distance of thirty or forty miles. Advancing into the\r\ncountry, this appearance proves equally deceptive, and the snowy range\r\nis resolved into isolated peaks, situated on the meridional ridges;\r\ntheir snow-clad spurs, projecting east and west, cross one another, and\r\nbeing uniformly white, appear to connect the peaks into one grand\r\nunbroken range. The rivers, instead of having their origin in the snowy\r\nmountains, rise far beyond them; many of their sources are upwards of\r\none hundred miles in a straight line from the plains, in a very curious\r\ncountry, loftier by far in mean elevation than the meridional ridges\r\nwhich run south from it, yet comparatively bare of snow. This rearward\r\npart of the mountain region is Tibet, where all the Sikkim, Nepal, and\r\nBhotan rivers rise as small streams, increasing in size as they receive\r\nthe drainage from the snowed parts of the ridges that bound them in\r\ntheir courses. Their banks, between 8000 and 14,000 feet, are generally\r\nclothed with rhododendrons, sometimes to the almost total exclusion of\r\nother woody vegetation, especially near the snowy mountains—a cool\r\ntemperature and great humidity being the most favourable conditions for\r\nthe luxuriant growth of this genus.\r\n\r\nThe source of this humidity is the southerly or sea wind which blows\r\nsteadily from May till October in Sikkim, and prevails throughout the\r\nrest of the year, if not as the monsoon properly so called, as a\r\ncurrent from the moist atmosphere above the Gangetic delta. This rushes\r\nnorth to the rarefied regions of Sikkim, up the great valleys, and does\r\nnot appear materially disturbed by the north-west wind, which blows\r\nduring the afternoons of the winter months over the plains, and along\r\nthe flanks of the outer range, and is a dry surface current, due to the\r\ndiurnal heating of the soil. When it is considered that this wind,\r\nafter passing lofty mountains on the outer range, has to traverse\r\neighty or one hundred miles of alps before it has watered all the\r\nforest region, it will be evident that its moisture must be expended\r\nbefore it reaches Tibet.\r\n\r\nLet the figures in the accompanying woodcut, the one on the true scale,\r\nthe other with the heights exaggerated, represent two of these long\r\nmeridional ridges, from the watershed to the plains of India, following\r\nin this instance the course of the Teesta river, from its source at\r\n19,000 feet to where it debouches from the Himalaya at 300. The lower\r\nrugged outline represents one meridional ridge, with all its most\r\nprominent peaks (whether exactly or not on the line of section); the\r\nupper represents the parallel ridge of Singalelah (D.E.P.), of greater\r\nmean elevation, further west, introduced to show the maximum elevation\r\nof the Sikkim mountains, Kinchinjunga (28,178 feet), being represented\r\non it. A deep valley is interposed between these two ridges, with a\r\nfeeder of the Teesta in it (the Great Rungeet), which runs south from\r\nKinchin, and turning west enters the Teesta at R. The position of the\r\nbed of the Teesta river is indicated by a dotted line from its source\r\nat T to the plains at S; of Dorjiling, on the north flank of the outer\r\nrange, by _d_; of the first point where perpetual snow is met with, by\r\nP; and of the first indications of a Tibetan climate, by C.\r\n\r\nA warm current of Air, loaded with vapour, will deposit the bulk of its\r\nmoisture on the ridge of Sinchul, which rises above Dorjiling (_d_),\r\nand is 8,500 feet high. Passing on, little will be precipitated on _e_\r\nwhose elevation is the same as that of Sinchul; but much at _f_ (11,000\r\nfeet), where the current, being further cooled, has less capacity for\r\nholding vapour, and is further exhausted. When it ascends to P (15,000\r\nfeet) it is sufficiently cooled to deposit snow in the winter and\r\nspring months, more of which falling than can be melted during the\r\nsummer, it becomes perennial. At the top of ginchin very little falls,\r\nand it is doubtful if the southerly current ever reaches that\r\nprodigiously elevated isolated summit. The amount of surface above\r\n20,000 feet is, however, too limited and broken into isolated peaks to\r\ndrain the already nearly, exhausted current, whose condensed vapours\r\nroll along in fog beyond the parallel of Kinchin, are dissipated during\r\nthe day over the arid mountains of Tibet, and deposited at night on the\r\ncooled surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nSection of the Sikkim Himalaya along the course of the Teesta River.\r\n\r\nOther phenomena of no less importance than the distribution of vapour,\r\nand more or less depending on it, are the duration and amount of solar\r\nand terrestrial radiation. Towards D the sun is rarely seen during the\r\nrainy season, as well from the constant presence of nimbi aloft, as\r\nfrom fog on the surface of the ground. An absence of both light and\r\nheat is the result south of the parallel of Kinchin; and at C low fogs\r\nprevail at the same season, but do not intercept either the same amount\r\nof light or heat; whilst at T there is much sunshine and bright light.\r\nDuring the night, again, there is no terrestrial radiation between S\r\nand P; the rain either continues to pour—in some months with increased\r\nviolence—or the saturated atmosphere is condensed into a thick white\r\nmist, which hangs over the redundant vegetation. A bright starlight\r\nnight is almost unknown in the summer months at 6000 to 10,000 feet,\r\nbut is frequent in December and January, and at intervals between\r\nOctober and May, when, however, vegetation is little affected by the\r\ncold of nocturnal radiation. In the regions north of Kinchin, starlight\r\nnights are more frequent, and the cold produced by radiation, at 14,000\r\nfeet, is often severe towards the end of the rains in September. Still\r\nthe amount of clear weather during the night is small; the fog clears\r\noff for an hour or two at sunset as the wind falls, but the returning\r\ncold north current again chills the air soon afterwards, and rolling\r\nmasses of vapour are hence flying overhead, or sweeping the surface of\r\nthe earth, throughout the summer nights. In the Tibetan regions, on the\r\nother hand, bright nights and even sharp frosts prevail throughout the\r\nwarmest months.\r\n\r\nReferring again to the cut, it must be borne in mind that neither of\r\nthe two meridional ridges runs in a straight line, but that they wind\r\nor zigzag as all mountain ranges do; that spurs from each ridge are\r\ngiven off from either flank alternately, and that the origin of a spur\r\non one side answers to the source of a river (_i.e.,_ the head of a\r\nvalley) on the other. These rivers are feeders of the main stream, the\r\nTeesta, and run at more or less of an angle to the latter. The spurs\r\nfrom the east flank of one ridge cross, at their ends, those from the\r\nwest flank of another; and thus transverse valleys are formed,\r\npresenting many modifications of climate with regard to exposure,\r\ntemperature, and humidity.\r\n\r\nThe roads from the plains of India to the watershed in Tibet always\r\ncross these lateral spurs. The main ridge is too winding and rugged,\r\nand too lofty for habitation throughout the greater part of its length,\r\nwhile the river-channel is always very winding, unhealthy for the\r\ngreater part of the year below 4000 feet, and often narrow, gorge-like,\r\nand rocky. The villages are always placed above the unhealthy regions,\r\non the lateral spurs, which the traveller repeatedly crosses throughout\r\nevery day’s march; for these spurs give off lesser ones, and these\r\nagain others of a third degree, whence the country is cut up into as\r\nmany spurs, ridges, and ranges, as there are rills, streams, and rivers\r\namongst the mountains.\r\n\r\nThough the direction of the main atmospheric current is to the north,\r\nit is in reality seldom felt to be so, except the observer be on the\r\nvery exposed mountain tops, or watch the motions of the upper strata of\r\natmosphere. Lower currents of air rush up both the main and lateral\r\nvalleys, throughout the day; and from the sinuosities in the beds of\r\nthe rivers, and the generally transverse directions of their feeders,\r\nthe current often becomes an east or west one. In the branch valleys\r\ndraining to the north the wind still ascends; it is, in short, an\r\nascending warm, moist current, whatever course be pursued by the\r\nvalleys it follows.\r\n\r\nThe sides of each valley are hence equally supplied with moisture,\r\nthough local circumstances render the soil on one or the other flank\r\nmore or less humid and favourable to a luxuriant vegetation: such\r\ndifferences are a drier soil on the north side, with a too free\r\nexposure to the sun at low elevations, where its rays, however\r\ntransient, rapidly dry the ground, and where the rains, though very\r\nheavy, are of shorter duration, and where, owing to the capacity of the\r\nheated air for retaining moisture, day fogs are comparatively rare. In\r\nthe northern parts of Sikkim, again, some of the lateral valleys are so\r\nplaced that the moist wind strikes the side facing the south, and keeps\r\nit very humid, whilst the returning cold current from the neighbouring\r\nTibetan mountains impinges against the side facing the north, which is\r\nhence more bare of vegetation. An infinite number of local\r\npeculiarities will suggest themselves to any one conversant with\r\nphysical geography, as causing unequal local distribution of light,\r\nheat, and moisture in the different valleys of so irregular a country;\r\nnamely, the amount of slope, and its power of retaining moisture and\r\nsoil; the composition and hardness of the rocks; their dip and strike;\r\nthe protection of some valleys by lofty snowed ridges; and the free\r\nsouthern exposures of others at great elevations.\r\n\r\nThe position and elevation of the perpetual snow[401] vary with those\r\nof the individual ranges, and their exposure to the south wind. The\r\nexpression that the perpetual snow lies lower and deeper on the\r\nsouthern slopes of the Himalayan mountains than on the northern,\r\nconveys a false impression. It is better to say that the snow lies\r\ndeeper and lower on the southern faces of the individual mountains and\r\nspurs that form the snowy Himalaya. The axis itself of the chain is\r\ngenerally far north of the position of the spurs that catch all the\r\nsnow, and has comparatively very little snow on it, most of what there\r\nis lying upon north exposures.\r\n\r\n [401] It appears to me, as I have asserted in the pages of my Journal,\r\n that the limit of perpetual snow is laid down too low in all mountain\r\n regions, and that accumulations in hollows, and the descent of glacial\r\n ice, mask the phenomenon more effectually than is generally allowed.\r\n In this work I define the limit, as is customary, in general terms\r\n only, as being that where the accumulations are very great, and whence\r\n they are continuous upwards, on gentle slopes. All perpetual snow,\r\n however, becomes ice, and, as such, obeys the laws of glacial motion,\r\n moving as a viscous fluid; whence it follows that the lower edge of a\r\n snow-bed placed on a slope is, in one sense, the termination of a\r\n glacier, and indicates a position below that where all the snow that\r\n falls melts. I am well aware that it is impossible to define the limit\r\n required with any approach to accuracy. Steep and broken surfaces,\r\n with favourable exposures to the sun or moist winds, are bare much\r\n above places where snow lies throughout the year; but the occurrence\r\n of a gentle slope, free of snow, and covered with plants, cannot but\r\n indicate a point below that of perpetual snow. Such is the case with\r\n the “Jardin” on the Mer de Glace, whose elevation is 9,500 feet,\r\n whereas that of perpetual snow is considered by Professor J. Forbes,\r\n our best authority, to be 8,500 feet. Though limited in area, girdled\r\n by glaciers, presenting a very gentle slope to the east, and screened\r\n by surrounding mountains from a considerable proportion of the sun’s\r\n rays, the Jardin is clear, for fully three months of the year, of all\r\n but sporadic falls of snow, that never lie long; and so are similar\r\n spots placed higher on the neighbouring slopes; which facts are quite\r\n at variance with the supposition that the perpetual snow-line is below\r\n that point in the Mont Blanc Alps. On the Monte Rosa Alps, again, Dr.\r\n Thomson and I gathered plants in flower, above 12,000 feet on the\r\n steep face of the Weiss-thor Pass, and at 10,938 feet on the top of\r\n St. Theodule; but in the former case the rocks are too steep for any\r\n snow to lie, they are exposed to the south-east, and overhang a gorge\r\n 8000 feet deep, up which no doubt warm currents ascend; while at St.\r\n Theodule the plants were growing on a slope which, though gentle, is\r\n black and stony, and exposed to warm ascending currents, as on the\r\n Weiss-thor; and I do not consider either of these as evidences of the\r\n limit of perpetual snow being higher than their position.\r\n\r\n\r\nA reference to the woodcut will show that the same circumstances which\r\naffect the distribution of moisture and vegetation, determine the\r\nposition, amount, and duration of the snow. The principal fall will\r\noccur, as before shown, where the meridional range first attains a\r\nsufficiently great elevation, and the air becomes consequently cooled\r\nbelow 32°; this is at a little above 14,000 feet, sporadic falls\r\noccurring even in summer at that elevation: these, however, melt\r\nimmediately, and the copious winter falls also are dissipated before\r\nJune. As the depth of rain-fall diminishes in advancing north to the\r\nhigher parts of the meridional ranges, so does that of the snow-fall.\r\nThe permanence of the snow, again, depends on—1. The depth of the\r\naccumulation; 2. The mean temperature of the spot; 3. The melting power\r\nof the sun’s rays; 4. The prevalence and strength of evaporating winds.\r\nNow at 14,000 feet, though the accumulation is immense, the amount\r\nmelted by the sun’s rays is trifling, and there are no evaporating\r\nwinds; but the mean temperature is so high, and the corroding powers of\r\nthe rain (which falls abundantly throughout summer) and of the warm and\r\nhumid ascending currents are so great, that the snow is not perennial.\r\nAt 15,500 feet, again, it becomes perennial, and its permanence at this\r\nlow elevation (at P) is much favoured by the accumulation and detention\r\nof fogs over the rank vegetation which prevails from S nearly to P; and\r\nby the lofty mountains beyond it, which shield it from the returning\r\ndry currents from the north. In proceeding north all the circumstances\r\nthat tend to the dispersion of the snow increase, whilst the fall\r\ndiminishes. At P the deposition is enormous and the snow-line\r\nlow—16,000 feet; whilst at T little falls, and the limit of perpetual\r\nsnow is 19,000 and 20,000 feet. Hence the anomaly, that the snow-line\r\nascends in advancing north to the coldest Himalayan regions. The\r\nposition of the greatest peaks and of the greatest mass of perpetual\r\nsnow being generally assumed as indicating a ridge and watershed,\r\ntravellers, arguing from single mountains alone, on the meridional\r\nridges, have at one time supported and at another denied the assertion,\r\nthat the snow lies longer and deeper on the north than on the south\r\nslope of the Himalayan ridge.\r\n\r\nThe great accumulation of snow at 15,000 feet, in the parallel of P,\r\nexercises a decided influence on the vegetation. The alpine\r\nrhododendrons hardly reach 14,000 feet in the broad valleys and\r\nround-headed spurs of the mountains of the Tunkra and Chola passes;\r\nwhilst the same species ascend to 16,000, and one to 17,000 feet, at T.\r\nBeyond the latter point, again, the great aridity of the climate\r\nprevents their growth, and in Tibet there are generally none even as\r\nlow as 12,000 and 14,000 feet. Glaciers, again, descend to 15,000 feet\r\nin the tortuous gorges which immediately debouch from the snows of\r\nKinchinjunga, but no plants grow on the débris they carry down, nor is\r\nthere any sward of grass or herbage at their base, the atmosphere\r\nimmediately around being chilled by enormous accumulations of snow, and\r\nthe summer sun rarely warming the soil. At T, again, the glaciers do\r\nnot descend below 16,000 feet, but a greensward of vegetation creeps up\r\nto their bases, dwarf rhododendrons cover the moraines, and herbs grow\r\non the patches of earth carried down by the latter, which are thawed by\r\nthe more frequent sunshine, and by the radiation of heat from the\r\nunsnowed flanks of the valleys down which these ice-streams pour.\r\n\r\nLooking eastward or westward on the map of India, we perceive that the\r\nphenomenon of perpetual snow is regulated by the same laws. From the\r\nlongitude of Upper Assam in 95° E to that of Kashmir in 75° E, the\r\nlowest limit of perpetual snow is 15,500 to 16,000 feet, and a shrubby\r\nvegetation affects the most humid localities near it, at 12,000 to\r\n14,000 feet. Receding from the plains of India and penetrating the\r\nmountains, the climate becomes drier, the snowline rises, and\r\nvegetation diminishes, whether the elevation of the land increases or\r\ndecreases; plants reaching 17,000 and 18,000 feet, and the snow-line,\r\n20,000 feet. To mention extreme cases; the snow-level of Sikkim in 27°\r\n30 minutes is at 16,000 feet, whereas in latitude 35° 30 minutes Dr.\r\nThomson found the snow line 20,000 feet on the mountains near the\r\nKarakoram Pass, and vegetation up to 18,500 feet—features I found to be\r\ncommon also to Sikkim in latitude 28°.\r\n\r\nThe Himalaya, north of Nepal, and thence eastward to the bend of the\r\nYaru-Tsampu (or Tibetan Burrampooter) has for its geographical limits\r\nthe plains of India to the south, and the bed of the Yaru to the north.\r\nAll between these limits is a mountain mass, to which Tibet (though so\r\noften erroneously called a plain)[402] forms no exception. The waters\r\nfrom the north side of this chain flow into the Tsampu, and those from\r\nthe south side into the Burrampooter of Assam, and the Ganges. The\r\nline, however tortuous, dividing the heads of these waters, is the\r\nwatershed, and the only guide we have to the axis of the Himalaya. This\r\nhas never been crossed by Europeans, except by Captain Turner’s embassy\r\nin 1798, and Captain Bogle’s in 1779, both of which reached the Yaru\r\nriver. In the account published by Captain Turner, the summit of the\r\nwatershed is not rigorously defined, and the boundary, of Tibet and\r\nBhotan is sometimes erroneously taken for it; the boundary being at\r\nthat point a southern spur of Chumulari.[403] Eastwards from the\r\nsources of the Tsampu, the watershed of the Himalaya seems to follow a\r\nvery winding course, and to be everywhere to the north of the snowy\r\npeaks seen from the plains of India. It is by a line through these\r\nsnowy peaks that the axis of the Himalaya is represented in all our\r\nmaps; because they _ seem_ from the plains to be situated on an east\r\nand west ridge, instead of being placed on subsidiary meridional\r\nridges, as explained above. It is also across or along the subsidiary\r\nridges that the boundary line between the Tibetan provinces and those\r\nof Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhotan, is usually drawn; because the enormous\r\naccumulations of snow form a more efficient natural barrier than the\r\ngreater height of the less snowed central part of the chain beyond\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n [402] The only true account of the general features of eastern Tibet\r\n is to be found in MM. Huc and Gabet’s travels. Their description\r\n agrees with Dr. Thomson’s account of western Tibet, and with my\r\n experience of the parts to the north of Sikkim, and the information I\r\n everywhere obtained. The so-called _plains_ are the flat floors of the\r\n valleys, and the terraces on the margins of the rivers, which all flow\r\n between stupendous mountains. The term “maidan,” so often applied to\r\n Tibet by the natives, implies, not a plain like that of India, but\r\n simply an open, dry, treeless country, in contrast to the densely\r\n wooded wet regions of the snowy Himalaya, south of Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [403] Between Donkia and Chumulari lies a portion of Tibet (including\r\n the upper part of the course of the Machoo river) bounded on the east\r\n by Bhotan, and on the west by Sikkim (see chapter xxii). Turner, when\r\n crossing the Simonang Pass, descended westwards into the valley of the\r\n Machoo, and was still on the Indian watershed.\r\n\r\nThough, however, our maps draw the axis through the snowy peaks, they\r\nalso make the rivers to rise beyond the latter, on the northern slopes\r\nas it were, and to flow southwards through gaps in the axis. Such a\r\nfeature is only reconcilable with the hypothesis of the chain being\r\ndouble, as the Cordillera of Peru and Chili is said to be,\r\ngeographically, and which in a geological sense it no doubt is: but to\r\nthe Cordillera the Himalaya offers no parallel. The results of Dr.\r\nThomson’s study of the north-west Himalaya and Tibet, and my own of the\r\nnorth-east extreme of Sikkim and Tibet, first gave me an insight into\r\nthe true structure of this chain. Donkia mountain is the culminant\r\npoint of an immensely elevated mass of mountains, of greater mean\r\nheight than a similarly extensive area around Kinchin junga. It\r\ncomprises Chumulari, and many other mountains much above 20,000 feet,\r\nthough none equalling Kinchinjunga, Junnoo, and Kubra. The great lakes\r\nof Ramchoo and Cholamoo are placed on it; and the rivers rising on it\r\nflow in various directions; the Painomchoo north-west into the Yaru;\r\nthe Arun west to Nepal; the Teesta south-west through Sikkim; the\r\nMachoo south, and the Pachoo south-east, through Bhotan. All these\r\nrivers have their sources far beyond the great snowed mountains, the\r\nArun most conspicuously of all, flowing completely at the back or north\r\nof Kinchinjunga. Those that flow southwards, break through no chain,\r\nnor do they meet any contraction as they pass the snowy parts of the\r\nmountains which bound the valleys in which they flow, but are bound by\r\nuniform ranges of lofty mountains, which become more snowy as they\r\napproach the plains of India. These valleys, however, gradually\r\ncontract as they descend, being less open in Sikkim and Nepal than in\r\nTibet, though there bounded by rugged mountains, which from being so\r\nbare of snow and of vegetation, do not give the same impression of\r\nheight as the isolated sharper peaks which rise out of a dense forest,\r\nand on which the snow limit is 4000 or 5000 feet lower.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the bottom of the river valleys being flatter towards the\r\nwatershed, is connected with that of their fall being less rapid at\r\nthat part of their course; this is the consequence of the great extent\r\nin breadth of the most elevated portion of the chain. If we select the\r\nTeesta as an example, and measure its fall at three points of its\r\ncourse, we shall find the results very different. From its principal\r\nsource at Lake Cholamoo, it descends from 17,000 to 15,000 feet, with a\r\nfall of 60 feet to the mile; from 15,000 to 12,000 feet, the fall is\r\n140 feet to the mile; in the third part of its course it descends from\r\n12,000 to 5000 feet, with a fall of 160 feet to the mile; and in the\r\nlower part the descent is from 5000 feet to the plains of India at 300\r\nfeet, giving a fall of 50 feet to the mile. There is, however, no\r\nmarked limit to these divisions; its valley. gradually contracts, and\r\nits course gradually becomes more rapid. It is worthy of notice that\r\nthe fall is at its maximum through that part of its valley of which the\r\nflanks are the most loaded with snow; where the old moraines are very\r\nconspicuous, and where the present accumulations from landslips, etc.,\r\nare the most extensive.[404]\r\n\r\n [404] It is not my intention to discuss here the geological bearings\r\n of this curious question; but I may state that as the humidity of the\r\n climate of the middle region of the river-course tends to increase the\r\n fall in a given space, so I believe the dryness of the climate of the\r\n loftier country has the opposite effect, by preserving those\r\n accumulations which have raised the floors of the valleys and rendered\r\n them level.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to Kinchinjunga, these facts are of importance, as\r\nshowing that mere elevation is in physical geography of secondary\r\nimportance. That lofty mountain rises from a spur of the great range of\r\nDonkia, and is quite removed from the watershed or axis of the\r\nHimalaya, the rivers which drain its northern and southern flanks alike\r\nflowing to the Ganges. Were the Himalaya to be depressed 18,000 feet,\r\nKubra, Junnoo, Pundim, etc., would form a small cluster of rocky\r\nislands 1000 to 7000 feet high, grouped near Kinchinjunga, itself a\r\ncape 10,000 feet high, which would be connected by a low, marrow neck,\r\nwith an extensive and mountainous tract of land to its north-east; the\r\nlatter being represented by Donkia. To the north of Kinchin a deep bay\r\nor inlet would occupy the present valley of the Arun, and would be\r\nbounded on the north by the axis of the Himalaya, which would form a\r\ncontinuous tract of land beyond it. Since writing the above, I have\r\nseen Professor J. Forbes’s beautiful work on the glaciers of Norway: it\r\nfully justifies a comparison of the Himalaya to Norway, which has long\r\nbeen a familiar subject of theoretical enquiry with Dr. Thomson and\r\nmyself. The deep narrow valleys of Sikkim admirably represent the\r\nNorwegian fiords; the lofty, rugged, snowy mountains, those more or\r\nless submerged islands of the Norwegian coast; the broad rearward\r\nwatershed, or axis of the chain, with its lakes, is the same in both,\r\nand the Yaru-tsampu occupies the relative position of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole chain of the Himalaya east of Kumaon there are, I have\r\nno doubt, a succession of such lofty masses as Donkia, giving off\r\nstupendous spurs such as that on which Kinchin forms so conspicuous a\r\nfeature. In support of this view we find every river rising far beyond\r\nthe snowy peaks, which are separated by continuously unsnowed ranges\r\nplaced between the great white masses that these spurs present to the\r\nobserver from the south.[405] From the Khasia mountains (south-east of\r\nSikkim) many of these groups or spurs were seen by Dr. Thomson and\r\nmyself, at various distances (80 to 210 miles); and these groups were\r\nbetween the courses of the great rivers the Soobansiri, Monass, and\r\nPachoo, all east of Sikkim. Other masses seen from the Gangetic valley\r\nprobably thus mark the relative positions of the Arun, Cosi, Gunduk,\r\nand Gogra rivers.\r\n\r\n [405] At vol. i. p. 185, I have particularly called attention to the\r\n fact, that west of Kinchinjunga there is no continuation of a snowy\r\n Himalaya, as it is commonly called. So between Donkia and Chumulari\r\n there is no perpetual snow, and the valley of the Machoo is very\r\n broad, open, and comparatively flat.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother mass like that of Chumulari and Donkia, is that around the\r\nMansarowar lakes, so ably surveyed by the brothers Captains R. and H.\r\nStrachey, which is evidently the centre of the Himalaya. From it the\r\nGogra, Sutlej, Indus, and Yaru rivers all flow to the Indian side of\r\nAsia; and from it spring four chains, two of which are better known\r\nthan the others. These are:—1. The eastern Himalaya, whose axis runs\r\nnorth of Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhotan, to the bend of the Yaru, the valley\r\nof which it divides from the plains of India. 2. The north-west\r\nHimalaya, which separates the valley of the Indus from the plains of\r\nIndia. Behind these, and probably parallel to them, lie two other\r\nchains. 3. The Kouenlun or Karakoram chain, dividing the Indus from the\r\nYarkand river. 4. The chain north of the Yaru, of which nothing is\r\nknown. All the waters from the two first of these chains, flow into the\r\nIndian Ocean, as do those from the south faces of the third and fourth;\r\nthose from the north side of the Kouenlun, and of the chain north of\r\nthe Yaru, flow into the great valley of Lake Lhop, which may once have\r\nbeen continuous with the Amoor river.[406]\r\n\r\n [406] The Chinese assert that Lake Lhop once drained into the\r\n Hoang-ho; the statement is curious, and capable of confirmation when\r\n central Asia shall have been explored.\r\n\r\nFor this view of the physical geography of the western Himalaya and\r\ncentral Asia, I am indebted to Dr. Thomson. It is more consonant with\r\nnature, and with what we know of the geography of the country and of\r\nthe nature of mountain chains, than that of the illustrious Humboldt,\r\nwho divides central Asia by four parallel chains, united by two\r\nmeridional ones; one at each extremity of the mountain district. It\r\nfollows in continuation and conclusion of our view that the mountain\r\nmass of Pamir or Bolor, between the sources of the Oxus and those of\r\nthe Yarkand river, may be regarded as a centre from which spring the\r\nthree greatest mountain systems of Asia. These are:—1. A great chain,\r\nwhich runs in a north-easterly direction as far as Behring’s Straits,\r\nseparating all the rivers of Siberia from those which flow into the\r\nPacific Ocean. 2. The Hindoo Koosh, continued through Persia, and\r\nArmenia into Taurus. And, 3. The Muztagh or Karakorum, which probably\r\nextends due east into China, south of the Hoang-ho, but which is broken\r\nup north of Mansarowar into the chains which have been already\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\nON THE CLIMATE OF SIKKIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meteorology of Sikkim, as of every part of the Himalayan range, is\r\na subject of growing interest and importance; as it becomes yearly more\r\nnecessary for the Government to afford increased facilities for a\r\nresidence in the mountains to Europeans in search of health, or of a\r\nsalubrious climate for their families, or for themselves on retirement\r\nfrom the exhausting service of the plains. I was therefore surprised to\r\nfind no further register of the weather at Dorjiling, than an\r\ninsufficient one of the rain-fall, kept by the medical officer in\r\ncharge of the station; who, in this, as in all similar cases,[407] has\r\nneither the time nor the opportunity to give even the minimum of\r\nrequired attention to the subject of meteorology. This defect has been\r\nin a measure remedied by Dr. Chapman, who kept a twelve-months’\r\nregister in 1837, with instruments carefully compared with Calcutta\r\nstandards by the late James Prinsep, Esq., one of the most accomplished\r\nmen in literature and science that India ever saw.\r\n\r\n [407] The government of India has gone to an immense expense, and\r\n entailed a heavy duty upon its stationary medical officers, in\r\n supplying them with sometimes admirable, but more often very\r\n inaccurate, meteorological instruments, and requiring that daily\r\n registers be made, and transmitted to Calcutta. In no case have I\r\n found it to be in the officer’s power to carry out this object; he has\r\n never time, seldom the necessary knowledge and experience, and far too\r\n often no inclination. The majority of the observations are in most\r\n cases left to personal native or other servants, and the laborious\r\n results I have examined are too frequently worthless.\r\n\r\nThe annual means of temperature, rain-fall, etc., vary greatly in the\r\nHimalaya; and apparently slight local causes produce such great\r\ndifferences of temperature and humidity, that one year’s observations\r\ntaken at one spot, however full and accurate they may be, are\r\ninsufficient: this is remarkably the case in Sikkim, where the rainfall\r\nis great, and where the difference between those of two consecutive\r\nyears is often greater than the whole annual London fall. My own\r\nmeteorological observations necessarily form but a broken series, but\r\nthey were made with the best instruments, and with a view to obtaining\r\nresults that should be comparable _inter se,_ and with those of\r\nCalcutta; when away from Dorjiling too, in the interior of Sikkim, I\r\nhad the advantage of Mr. Muller’s services in taking observations at\r\nhours agreed upon previous to my leaving, and these were of the\r\ngreatest importance, both for calculating elevations, and for\r\nascertaining the differences of temperature, humidity, diurnal\r\natmospheric tide, and rain-fall; all of which vary with the elevation,\r\nand the distance from the plains of India.\r\n\r\nMr. Hodgson’s house proved a most favourable spot for an observatory,\r\nbeing placed on the top of the Dorjiling spur, with its broad verandah\r\nfacing the north, in which I protected the instruments from\r\nradiation[408] and wind. Broad grass-plots and a gravel walk surrounded\r\nthe house, and large trees were scattered about; on three sides the\r\nground sloped away, while to the north the spur gently rose behind.\r\n\r\n [408] This is a most important point, generally wholly neglected in\r\n India, where I have usually seen the thermometer hung in good shade,\r\n but exposed to reflected heat from walls, gravel walks, or dry earth.\r\n I am accustomed from experience to view all extreme temperatures with\r\n great suspicion, on this and other accounts. It is very seldom that\r\n the temperature of the free shaded air rises much above 100°, except\r\n during hot winds, when the lower stratum only of atmosphere (often\r\n loaded with hot particles of sand), sweeps over the surface of a soil\r\n scorched by the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nThroughout the greater part of the year the prevailing wind is from the\r\nsouth-east, and comes laden with moisture from the Bay of Bengal: it\r\nrises at sunrise, and its vapours are early condensed on the forests of\r\nSinchul; billowy clouds rapidly succeed small patches of vapour, which\r\nrolling over to the north side of the mountain, are carried north-west,\r\nover a broad intervening valley, to Dorjiling. There they bank on the\r\neast side of the spur, and this being partially clear of wood, the\r\naccumulation is slow, and always first upon the clumps of trees. Very\r\ngenerally by 9 a.m., the whole eastern sky, from the top of Dorjiling\r\nridge, is enveloped in a dense fog, while the whole western exposure\r\nenjoys sunshine for an hour or two later. At 7 or 8 a.m., very small\r\npatches are seen to collect on Tonglo, which gradually dilate and\r\ncoalesce, but do not shroud the mountain for some hours, generally not\r\nbefore 11 a.m. or noon. Before that time, however, masses of mist have\r\nbeen rolling over Dorjiling ridge to the westward, and gradually\r\nfilling up the valleys, so that by noon, or 1 p.m., every object is in\r\ncloud. Towards sunset it falls calm, when the mist rises, first from\r\nSinchul, or if a south-east wind sets in, from Tonglo first.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is more uniform at Mr. Hodgson’s bungalow, which is on\r\nthe top of the Dorjiling ridge, than on either of its flanks; this is\r\nvery much because a good deal of wood is left upon it, whose cool\r\nfoliage attracts and condenses the mists. Its mean temperature is lower\r\nby nearly 2·5° than that of Mr. Muller’s and Dr. Campbell’s houses,\r\nboth situated on the slopes, 400 feet below. This I ascertained by\r\nnumerous comparative observations of the temperature of the air, and by\r\nburying thermometers in the earth: it is chiefly to be accounted for by\r\nthe more frequent sunshine at the lower stations, the power of the sun\r\noften raising the thermometer in shade to 80°, at Mr. Muller’s; whereas\r\nduring the summer I spent at Mr. Hodgson’s it never rose much above\r\n70°, attaining that height very seldom and for a very short period\r\nonly. The nights, again, are uniformly and equally cloudy at both\r\nstations, so that there is no corresponding cold of nocturnal radiation\r\nto reduce the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe mean decrease of temperature due to elevation, I have stated\r\n(Appendix I.) to be about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent; according to\r\nwhich law Mr. Hodgson’s should not be more than 1·5° colder than Mr.\r\nMuller’s. These facts prove how difficult it is to choose\r\nunexceptionable sites for meteorological observatories in mountainous\r\ncountries; discrepancies of so great an amount being due to local\r\ncauses, which, as in this case, are perhaps transient; for should the\r\ntop of the spur be wholly cleared of timber, its temperature would be\r\nmaterially raised; at the expense, probably, of a deficiency of water\r\nat certain seasons. Great inequalities of temperature are also produced\r\nby ascending currents of heated air from the Great Rungeet valley,\r\nwhich affect certain parts of the station only; and these raise the\r\nthermometer 10° (even when the sun is clouded) above what it indicates\r\nat other places of equal elevation.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of Dorjiling (elev. 7,430 feet) is very nearly\r\n50°, or 2° higher than that of London, and 26° below that of Calcutta\r\n(78°,[409] or 78·5° in the latest published tables[410]); which,\r\nallowing 1° of diminution of temperature for every degree of latitude\r\nleaves 1° due to every 300 feet of ascent above Calcutta to the height\r\nof Dorjiling, agreeably to my own observations. This diminution is not\r\nthe same for greater heights, as I shall have occasion to show in a\r\nseparate chapter of this Appendix, on the decrement of heat with\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n [409] Prinsep, in As. Soc. Journ., Jan. 1832, p. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n [410] Daniell’s Met. Essays, vol. ii. p. 341.\r\n\r\n\r\nA remarkable uniformity of temperature prevails throughout the year at\r\nDorjiling, there being only 22° difference between the mean\r\ntemperatures of the hottest and coldest months; whilst in London, with\r\na lower mean temperature, the equivalent difference is 27°. At 11,000\r\nfeet this difference is equal to that of London. In more elevated\r\nregions, it is still greater, the climate becoming excessive at 15,000\r\nfeet, where the difference amounts to 30° at least.[411] The\r\naccompanying table is the result of an attempt to approximate to the\r\nmean temperatures and ranges of the thermometer at various elevations.\r\n\r\n [411] This is contrary to the conclusions of all meteorologists who\r\n have studied the climate of the Alps, and is entirely due to the local\r\n disturbances which I have so often dwelt upon, and principally to the\r\n unequal distribution of moisture in the loftier rearward regions, and\r\n the aridity of Tibet. Professor James Forbes states (Ed. Phil. Trans.,\r\n v. xiv. p. 489):—1. That the decrement of temperature with altitude is\r\n most rapid in summer: this (as I shall hereafter show) is not the case\r\n in the Himalaya, chiefly because the warm south moist wind then\r\n prevails. 2. That the annual range of temperature diminishes with the\r\n elevation: this, too, is not the case in Sikkim, because of the barer\r\n surface and more cloudless skies of the rearward loftier regions. 3.\r\n That the diurnal range of temperature diminishes with the height: that\r\n this is not the cane follows from the same cause. 4. That radiation is\r\n least in winter: this is negatived by the influence of the summer\r\n rains.\r\n\r\nAltitude Mean\r\nShade Mean\r\nWarmest\r\nMonth Mean\r\nColdest\r\nMonth Mean Daily\r\nRange of\r\nTemperature Rain-fall\r\nin\r\ninches 11,000 feet\r\n15,000 feet\r\n19,000 feet 40·9\r\n29·8\r\n19·8 50·0\r\n40·0\r\n32·0 24·0\r\n11·0\r\n  0·0 20·0\r\n27·0\r\n35·0 40·0\r\n20·0\r\n10·0 1°=320 feet\r\n1°=350 feet\r\n1°=400 feet\r\n\r\nSupposing the same formula to apply (which I exceedingly doubt) to\r\nheights above 19,000 feet, 2° would be the mean annual temperature of\r\nthe summit of Kinchinjunga, altitude 28,178 feet, the loftiest known\r\nspot on the globe: this is a degree or two higher than the temperature\r\nof the poles of greatest cold on the earth’s surface, and about the\r\ntemperature of Spitzbergen and Melville island.\r\n\r\nThe upper limit of phenogamic vegetation coincides with a mean\r\ntemperature of 30° on the south flank of Kinchinjunga, and of 22° in\r\nTibet; in both cases annuals and perennial-rooted herbaceous plants are\r\nto be found at elevations corresponding to these mean temperatures, and\r\noften at higher elevations in sheltered localities. I have assumed the\r\ndecrease of temperature for a corresponding amount of elevation to be\r\ngradually less in ascending (1°=320 feet at 6000 to 10,000 feet, 1°=400\r\nfeet at 14,000 to 18,000 feet). My observations appear to prove this,\r\nbut I do not regard them as conclusive; supposing them to be so, I\r\nattribute it to a combination of various causes, especially to the\r\nincreased elevation and yet unsnowed condition of the mass of land\r\nelevated above 16,000 feet, and consequent radiation of heat; also to\r\nthe greater amount of sunshine there; and to the less dense mists which\r\nobstruct the sun’s rays at all elevations. In corroboration of this I\r\nmay mention that the decrease of temperature with elevation is much\r\nless in summer than in winter, 1° of Fahr. being equivalent to only 250\r\nfeet in January between 7000 and 13,000 feet, and to upwards of 400\r\nfeet in July. Again, at Dorjiling (7,430 feet) the temperature hardly\r\never rises above 70° in the summer months, yet it often rises even\r\nhigher in Tibet at 12,000 to 14,000 feet. On the other hand, the\r\nwinters, and the winter nights especially, are disproportionately cold\r\nat great heights, the thermometer falling upwards of 40° below the\r\nDorjiling temperature at an elevation only 6000 feet higher.\r\n\r\nThe diurnal distribution of temperature is equally and similarly\r\naffected by the presence of vapour at different altitudes. The lower\r\nand outer ranges of 6000 to 10,000 feet, first receive the diurnal\r\ncharge of vapour-loaded southerly winds; those beyond them get more of\r\nthe sun’s rays, and the rearward ones more still. Though the summer\r\ndays of the northern localities are warmer than their elevation would\r\nindicate, the nights are not proportionally cold; for the light mist of\r\n14,000 feet, which replaces the dense fog of 7000 feet, effectually\r\nobstructs nocturnal radiation, though it is less an obstacle to solar\r\nradiation. Clear nights, be it observed, are as rare at Momay (15,300\r\nfeet) as at Dorjiling, the nights if windy being rainy; or, if calm,\r\ncold currents descend from the mountains, condensing the moist vapours\r\nof the valleys, whose narrow floors are at sunrise bathed in mist at\r\nall elevations in Sikkim. The rise and dispersion of these dense mists,\r\nand their collection and recondensation on the mountains in the\r\nmorning, is one of the most magnificent phenomena of the Himalaya, when\r\nviewed from a proper elevation; it commences as soon as the sun appears\r\non the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe mean daily range of the thermometer at 7000 feet is 13° in cleared\r\nspots, but considerably less in wooded, and certainly one-third less in\r\nthe forest itself. At Calcutta, which has almost an insular climate, it\r\namounts to 17°; at Delhi, which has a continental one, to 24·6°; and in\r\nLondon to 17·5°. At 11,000 feet it amounts to about 20°, and at 15,000\r\nfeet to 27°. These values vary widely in the different months, being\r\nmuch less in the summer or rainy months. The following is probably a\r\nfair approximation:—\r\n\r\nAt 7,000 feet it amounts to 8–9° in Aug. and Sept., and 17° in Dec.\r\nAt 11,000 feet it amounts to 12° in Aug. and Sept., and 30° in Dec.\r\nAt 15,000 feet it amounts to 15° in Aug. and Sept., and 40° in Dec.\r\nAt London it amounts to 20° in Aug. and Sept., and 10° in Dec.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of temperature throughout the day and year varies less\r\nat Dorjiling than in most mountainous countries, owing to the\r\nprevailing moisture, the effect of which is analogous to that of a\r\ncircumambient ocean to an island: the difference being, that in the\r\ncase of the island the bulk of water maintains an uniform temperature;\r\nin that of Dorjiling the quantity of vapour acts directly by\r\ninterfering with terrestrial and solar-radiation, and indirectly by\r\nnurturing a luxuriant vegetation. The result in the latter case is a\r\nclimate remarkable for its equability, and similar in many features to\r\nthat of New Zealand, South-west Chili, Fuegia, and the damp west coasts\r\nof Scotland and Ireland, and other countries exposed to moist sea\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of the year at Dorjiling, as taken by maxima and\r\nminima thermometers[412] by Dr. Chapman, is nearly the same as that of\r\nMarch and October: January, the coldest month, is more than 13·4°\r\ncolder than the mean of the year; but the hottest month is only 8·3°\r\nwarmer than the same mean: at Calcutta the months vary less from the\r\nmean; at Delhi more; and in London the distribution is wholly\r\ndifferent; there being no rains to modify the summer heat, July is 13°\r\nhotter, and January 14° colder than the mean of the year.\r\n\r\n [412] The mean of several of the months, thus deduced, often varies a\r\n good deal from the truth, owing to the unequal diurnal distribution of\r\n heat; a very few minutes’ sunshine raises the temperature l0° or 15°\r\n above the mean of the day; which excessive heat (usually transient)\r\n the maximum thermometer registers, and consequently gives too high a\r\n mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis distribution of the seasons has a most important effect upon\r\nvegetation, to which sufficient attention has not been paid by\r\ncultivators of alpine Indian plants; in the first place, though English\r\nwinters are cold enough for such, the summers are too hot and dry; and,\r\nin the second place, the great accession of temperature, causing the\r\nbuds to burst in spring, occurs in the Himalaya in March, when the\r\ntemperature at 7000 feet rises 8° above that of February, raising the\r\nradiating thermometer always above the freezing point, whence the young\r\nleaves are never injured by night frost: in England the corresponding\r\nrise is only 3°, and there is no such accession of temperature till\r\nMay, which is 8° warmer than April; hence, the young foliage of many\r\nHimalayan plants is cut off by night frosts in English gardens early in\r\nthe season, of which _Abies Webbiana_ is a conspicuous example.\r\n\r\nThe greatest heat of the day occurs at Dorjiling about noon, owing to\r\nthe prevalent cloud, especially during the rainy months, when the sun\r\nshines only in the mornings, if at all, and the clouds accumulate as\r\nthe day advances. According to hourly observations of my own, it\r\noccurred in July at noon, in August at 1 p.m., and in September (the\r\nmost rainy month) there was only four-tenths of a degree difference\r\nbetween the means of noon, 1 p.m., and 2 p.m., but I must refer to the\r\nabstracts at the end of this chapter for evidence of this, and of the\r\nwonderful uniformity of temperature during the rainy months. In the\r\ndrier season again, after September, the greatest heat occurs between 2\r\nand 3 p.m.; in Calcutta the hottest hour is about 2.45 p.m., throughout\r\nthe year; and in England also about 3 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe hour whose temperature coincides with the mean of the day\r\nnecessarily varies with the distribution of cloud and sunshine; it is\r\nusually about 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; whereas in Calcutta the same\r\ncoincidence occurs at a little before 10 a.m., and in England at about\r\n8 a.m.\r\n\r\nNext to the temperature of the air, observations on that of the earth\r\nare perhaps of the greatest value; both from their application to\r\nhorticulture, and from the approximation they afford to the mean\r\ntemperature of the week or month in which they are taken. These form\r\nthe subject of a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nNocturnal and solar radiation, the one causing the formation of dew and\r\nhoar-frost when the air in the shade is above freezing, end killing\r\nplants by the rapid abstraction of heat from all their surfaces which\r\nare exposed to the clear sky, and the other scorching the skin and\r\ntender plants during the day, are now familiar phenomena, and\r\nparticularly engaged my attention during my whole Indian journey. Two\r\nphenomena particularly obstruct radiation in Sikkim—the clouds and fog\r\nfrom the end of May till October, and the haze from February till May.\r\nTwo months alone are usually clear; one before and one after the rains,\r\nwhen the air, though still humid, is transparent. The haze has never\r\nbeen fully explained, though a well-known phenomenon. On the plains of\r\nIndia, at the foot of the hills, it begins generally in the forenoon of\r\nthe cold season, with the rise of the west wind; and, in February\r\nespecially, obscures the sun’s disc by noon; frequently it lasts\r\nthroughout the twenty-four hours, and is usually accompanied by great\r\ndryness of the atmosphere. It gradually diminishes in ascending, and\r\nhave never experienced it at 10,000 feet; at 7000, however, it very\r\noften, in April, obscures the snowy ranges 30 miles off, which are\r\nbright and defined at sunrise, and either pale away, or become of a\r\nlurid yellow-red, according to the density of this haze, till they\r\ndisappear at 10 a.m. I believe it always accompanies a south-west wind\r\n(which is a deflected current of the north-west) and dry atmosphere in\r\nSikkim.\r\n\r\nThe observations for solar radiation were taken with a black-bulb\r\nthermometer, and also with actinometers, but the value of the data\r\nafforded by the latter not being fixed or comparative, I shall give the\r\nresults in a separate section. (See Appendix K.) From a multitude of\r\ndesultory observations, I conclude that at 7,400 feet, 125·7°, or +67°\r\nabove the temperature of the air, is the average maximum effect of the\r\nsun’s rays on a black-bulb thermometer[413] throughout the year,\r\namounting rarely to +70° and +80° in the summer months, but more\r\nfrequently in the winter or spring. These results, though greatly above\r\nwhat are obtained at Calcutta, are not much, if at all, above what may\r\nbe observed on the plains of India. This effect is much increased with\r\nthe elevation. At 10,000 feet in December, at 9 a.m., I saw the mercury\r\nmount to 132° with a difl: of +94°, whilst the temperature of shaded\r\nsnow hard by was 22°; at 13,100 feet, in January, at 9 a.m., it has\r\nstood at 98°, diff. +68·2°; and at 10 a.m., at 114°, diff. +81·4°,\r\nwhilst the radiating thermometer on the snow had fallen at sunrise to\r\n0·7°. In December, at 13,500 feet, I have seen it 110°, diff. +84°; at\r\n11 a.m., 11,500 feet; 122°, diff: +82°. This is but a small selection\r\nfrom many instances of the extraordinary power of solar radiation in\r\nthe coldest months, at great elevations.\r\n\r\n [413] From the mean of very many observations, I find that 10° is the\r\n average difference at the level of the sea, in India, between two\r\n similar thermometers, with spherical bulbs (half-inch diam.), the one\r\n of black, and the other of plain glass, and both being equally exposed\r\n to the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\n\r\nNocturnal and terrestrial radiation are even more difficult phenomena\r\nfor the traveller to estimate than solar radiation, the danger of\r\nexposing instruments at night being always great in wild countries. I\r\nmost frequently used a thermometer graduated on the glass, and placed\r\nin the focus of a parabolic reflector, and a similar one laid upon\r\nwhite cotton,[414] and found no material difference in the mean of many\r\nobservations of each, though often 1° to 2° in individual ones.\r\nAvoiding radiation from surrounding objects is very difficult,\r\nespecially in wooded countries. I have also tried the radiating power\r\nof grass and the earth; the temperature of the latter is generally\r\nless, and that of the former greater, than the thermometer exposed on\r\ncotton or in the reflector, but much depends on the surface of the\r\nherbage and soil.\r\n\r\n [414] Snow radiates the most powerfully of any substance I have tried;\r\n in one instance, at 13,000 feet, in January, the thermometer on snow\r\n fell to 0·2°, which was 10·8° below the temperature at the time, the\r\n grass showing 6·7°; and on another occasion to 1·2°, when the air at\r\n the time (before sunrise) was 21·2°; the difference therefore being\r\n 20°. I have frequently made this observation, and always with a\r\n similar result; it may account for the great injury plants sustain\r\n from a thin covering of ice on their foliage, even when the\r\n temperature is but little below the freezing-point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power of terrestrial, like that of solar radiation, increases with\r\nthe elevation, but not in an equal proportion. At 7,400 feet, the mean\r\nof all my observations shows a temperature of 35·4°. During the rains,\r\n3° to 4° is the mean maximum, but the nights being almost invariably\r\ncloudy, it is scarcely on one night out of six that there is any\r\nradiation. From October to December the amount is greater=10° to 12,\r\nand from January till May greater still, being as much as 15°. During\r\nthe winter months the effect of radiation is often felt throughout the\r\nclear days, dew forming abundantly at 4000 to 8000 feet in the shaded\r\nbottoms of narrow valleys, into which the sun does not penetrate till\r\n10 a.m., and from which it disappears at 3 p.m. I have seen the\r\nthermometer in the reflector fall 12° at 10 a.m. in a shaded valley.\r\nThis often produces an anomalous effect, causing the temperature in the\r\nshade to fall after sunrise; for the mists which condense in the bottom\r\nof the valleys after midnight disperse after sunrise, but long before\r\nreached by the sun, and powerful radiation ensues, lowering the\r\nsurrounding temperature: a fall of 1° to 2° after sunrise of air in the\r\nshade is hence common in valleys in November and December.[415] The\r\nexcessive radiation of the winter months often gives rise to a curious\r\nphenomenon; it causes the formation of copious dew on the blanket of\r\nthe traveller’s bed, which radiates heat to the tent roof, and this\r\ninside either an open or a closed tent. I have experienced this at\r\nvarious elevations, from 6000 to 16,000 feet. Whether the minimum\r\ntemperature be as high as 50°, or but little above zero, the effect is\r\nthe same, except that hoar-frost or ice forms in the latter case.\r\nAnother remarkable effect of nocturnal radiation is the curl of the\r\nalpine rhododendron leaves in November, which is probably due to the\r\nfreezing and consequent expansion of the water in the upper strata of\r\ncells exposed to the sky. The first curl is generally repaired by the\r\nensuing day’s sun, but after two or three nights the leaves become\r\npermanently curled, and remain so till they fall in the following\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n [415] Such is the explanation which I have offered of this phenomenon\r\n in the Hort. Soc. Journal. On thinking over the matter since, I have\r\n speculated upon the probability of this fall of temperature being due\r\n to the absorption of heat that must become latent on the dispersion of\r\n the dense masses of white fog that choke the valleys at sunrise.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that the nocturnal radiation in the English spring months\r\nis the great obstacle to the cultivation of many Himalayan plants; but\r\nit is not therefore to be inferred that there is no similar amount of\r\nradiation in the Himalaya; for, on the contrary, in April its amount is\r\nmuch greater than in England, frequently equalling 13° of difference;\r\nand I have seen 16° at 7,500 feet; but the minimum temperature at the\r\ntime is 51°, and the absolute amount of cold therefore immaterial. The\r\nmean minimum of London is 38°, and, when lowered 5·5° by radiation, the\r\nconsequent cold is very considerable. Mr. Daniell, in his admirable\r\nessay on the climate of London, mentions 17° as the maximum effect of\r\nnocturnal radiation ever observed by him. I have registered 16° in\r\nApril at Dorjiling; nearly as much at 6000 feet in February; twice 13°,\r\nand once 14·2° in September at 15,500 feet; and 10° in October at\r\n16,800 feet; nearly 13° in January at 7000 feet; 14·5° in February at\r\nthat elevation, and, on several occasions, 14·7° at 10,000 feet in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nThe annual rain-fall at Dorjiling averages 120 inches (or 10 feet), but\r\nvaries from 100 to 130 in different years; this is fully three times\r\nthe amount of the average English fall,[416] and yet not one-fourth of\r\nwhat is experienced on the Khasia hills in Eastern Bengal, where fifty\r\nfeet of rain falls. The greater proportion descends between June and\r\nSeptember, as much as thirty inches sometimes falling in one month.\r\nFrom November to February inclusive, the months are comparatively dry;\r\nMarch and October are characterised by violent storms at the equinoxes,\r\nwith thunder, destructive lightning, and hail.\r\n\r\n [416] The general ideas on the subject of the English rain-fall are so\r\n very vague, that I may be pardoned for reminding my readers that in\r\n 1852, the year of extraordinary rain, the amounts varied from 28·5\r\n inches in Essex, to 50 inches at Cirencester, and 67·5 (average of\r\n five years) at Plympton St. Mary’s, and 102·5 at Holme, on the Dart.\r\n\r\nThe rain-gauge takes no account of the enormous deposition from mists\r\nand fogs: these keep the atmosphere in a state of moisture, the amount\r\nof which I have estimated at 0·88 as the saturation-point at Dorjiling,\r\n0·83 being that of London. In July, the dampest month, the\r\nsaturation-point is 0·97; and in December, owing to the dryness of the\r\nair on the neighbouring plains of India, whence dry blasts pass over\r\nSikkim, the mean saturation-point of the month sometimes falls as low\r\nas 0·69.\r\n\r\nThe dew-point is on the average of the year 49·3°, or 3° below the mean\r\ntemperature of the air. In the dampest month (July) the mean dew-point\r\nis only eight-tenths of a degree below the temperature, whilst in\r\nDecember it sinks 10° below it. In London the dew-point is on the\r\naverage 5·6° below the temperature; none of the English months are so\r\nwet as those of Sikkim, but none are so dry as the Sikkim December\r\nsometimes is.\r\n\r\n_On the weight of the atmosphere in Sikkim; and its effects on the\r\nhuman frame._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the phenomena of climate, the weight of the atmosphere is the\r\nmost remarkable for its elusion of direct observation, when unaided by\r\ninstruments. At the level of the sea, a man of ordinary bulk and\r\nstature is pressed upon by a superincumbent weight of 30,000 pounds or\r\n13·5 tons. An inch fall or rise in the barometer shows that this load\r\nis lightened or increased, sometimes in a few hours, by nearly 1,000\r\npounds; and no notice is taken of it, except by the meteorologist, or\r\nby the speculative physician, seeking the subtle causes of epidemic and\r\nendemic complaints. At Dorjiling (7,400 feet), this load is reduced to\r\nless than 2,500 pounds, with no appreciable result whatever on the\r\nframe, however suddenly it be transported to that elevation. And the\r\nobservation of my own habits convinced me that I took the same amount\r\nof meat, drink, sleep, exercise and work, not only without\r\ninconvenience, but without the slightest perception of my altered\r\ncircumstances. On ascending to 14,000 feet, owing to the diminished\r\nsupply of oxygen, exercise brings on vertigo and headache; ascending\r\nhigher still, lassitude and tension across the forehead ensue, with\r\nretching, and a sense of weight dragging down the stomach, probably due\r\nto dilatation of the air contained in that organ. Such are the all but\r\ninvariable effects of high elevations; varying with most persons\r\naccording to the suddenness and steepness of the ascent, the amount and\r\nduration of exertion, and the length of time previously passed at great\r\nheights. After having lived for some weeks at 15,300 feet, I have\r\nthence ascended several times to 18,500, and once above 19,000 feet,\r\nwithout any sensations but lassitude and quickness of pulse;[417] but\r\nin these instances it required great caution to avoid painful symptoms.\r\nResiding at 15,300 feet, however, my functions were wholly undisturbed;\r\nnor could I detect any quickness of pulse or of respiration when the\r\nbody was at rest, below 17,000 feet. At that elevation, after resting a\r\nparty of eight men for an hour, the average of their and my pulses was\r\nabove 100°, both before and after eating; in one case it was 120°, in\r\nnone below 80°.\r\n\r\n [417] I have in a note to vol. ii. p. 160, stated that I never\r\n experienced in my own person, nor saw in others, bleeding at the ears,\r\n nose, lips, or eyelids.\r\n\r\nNot only is the frame of a transient visitor unaffected (when at rest)\r\nby the pressure being reduced from 30,000 to 13,000 pounds, but the\r\nTibetan, born and constantly residing at upwards of 14,000 feet,\r\ndiffers in no respect that can be attributed to diminished pressure,\r\nfrom the native of the level of the sea. The averaged duration of life,\r\nand the amount of food and exercise is the same; eighty years are\r\nrarely reached by either. The Tibetan too, however inured to cold and\r\ngreat elevations, still suffers when he crosses passes 18,000 or 19,000\r\nfeet high, and apparently neither more nor less than I did.\r\n\r\nLiebig remarks (in his “Animal Chemistry”) that in an equal number of\r\nrespirations,[418] we consume a larger amount of oxygen at the level of\r\nthe sea than on a mountain; and it can be shown that under ordinary\r\ncircumstances at Dorjiling, 20·14 per cent. less is inhaled than on the\r\nplains of India. Yet the chest cannot expand so as to inspire more at\r\nonce, nor is the respiration appreciably quickened; by either of which\r\nmeans nature would be enabled to make up the deficiency. It is true\r\nthat it is difficult to count one’s own respirations, but the average\r\nis considered in a healthy man to be eighteen in a minute; in my own\r\ncase it is sixteen, an acceleration of which by three or four could not\r\nhave been overlooked, in the repeated trials I made at Dorjiling, and\r\nstill less the eight additional inhalations required at 15,000 feet to\r\nmake up for the deficiency of oxygen in the air of that elevation.\r\n\r\n [418] For the following note I am indebted to my friend, C. Muller,\r\n Esq., of Patna.—\r\n    According to Sir H. Davy, a man consumes 45,504 cubic inches of\r\n    oxygen in twenty-four hours, necessitating the inspiration of\r\n    147,520 cubic inches of atmospheric air.—At pressure 23 inches, and\r\n    temp. 60° this volume of atmospheric air (dry) would weigh\r\n    35,138·75 grains.—At pressure 30 in., temp. 80°, it would weigh\r\n    43,997·63 gr.\r\n    The amount of oxygen in atmospheric air is 23·32 per cent. by\r\n    weight. The oxygen, then, in 147,520 cubic inches of dry air, at\r\n    pressure 23 in., temp. 80°, weighs 8,194·35 gr.; and at pressure 30\r\n    in., temp. 80°, it weighs 10,260·25 gr.\r\n    Hence the absolute quantity of oxygen in a given volume of\r\n    atmospheric air, when the pressure is 23 in., and the temp. 60°, is\r\n    20·14 per cent. less than when the pressure is 30 in. and the temp.\r\n    80°.\r\n    When the air at pressure 23 in:, temp. 60°, is saturated with\r\n    moisture, the proportion of dry air and aqueous vapour in 100 cubic\r\n    inches is as follows:—\r\n                    Dry air  97·173\r\n                    Vapour  2·827\r\n    At pressure 30 in., temp. 80°, the proportions are:—\r\n                    Dry air  96·133\r\n                    Vapour  3·867\r\n    The effect of aqueous vapour in the air on the amount of oxygen\r\n    available for consumption, is very trifling; and it must not be\r\n    forgotten that aqueous vapour supplies oxygen to the system as well\r\n    as atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nIt has long been surmised that an alpine vegetation may owe some of its\r\npeculiarities to the diminished atmospheric pressure; and that the\r\nlatter being a condition which the gardener cannot supply, he can never\r\nsuccessfully cultivate such plants in general. I know of no foundation\r\nfor this hypothesis; many plants, natives of the level of the sea in\r\nother parts of the world, and some even of the hot plains of Bengal,\r\nascend to 12,000 and even 15,000 feet on the Himalaya, unaffected by\r\nthe diminished pressure. Any number of species from low countries may\r\nbe cultivated, and some have been for ages, at 10,000 to 14,000 feet\r\nwithout change. It is the same with the lower animals; innumerable\r\ninstances may with ease be adduced of pressure alone inducing no\r\nappreciable change, whilst there is absence of proof to the contrary.\r\nThe phenomena that accompany diminished pressure are the real obstacles\r\nto the cultivation of alpine plants, of which cold and the excessive\r\nclimate are perhaps the most formidable. Plants that grow in localities\r\nmarked by sudden extremes of heat and cold, are always very variable in\r\nstature, habit, and foliage. In a state of nature we say the plants\r\n“accommodate themselves” to these changes, and so they do within\r\ncertain limits; but for one that survives of all the seeds that\r\ngerminate in these inhospitable localities, thousands die. In our\r\ngardens we can neither imitate the conditions of an alpine climate, nor\r\noffer others suited to the plants of such climates.\r\n\r\nThe mean height of the barometer at Mr. Hodgson’s was 23·010, but\r\nvaried 0·161 between July, when it was lowest, and October, when it was\r\nhighest; following the monthly rise and fall of Calcutta as to period,\r\nbut not as to amount (or amplitude); for the mercury at Calcutta stands\r\nin July upwards of half an inch (0·555 Prinsep) lower than it does in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe diurnal tide of atmosphere is as constant as to the time of its ebb\r\nand flow at Dorjiling as at Calcutta; and a number of very careful\r\nobservations (made with special reference to this object) between the\r\nlevel of the plains of India, and 17,000 feet, would indicate that\r\nthere is no very material deviation from this at any elevation in\r\nSikkim. These times are very nearly 9.50 a.m. and about 10 p.m. for the\r\nmaxima, the 9.50 a.m. very constantly, and the 10 p.m. with more\r\nuncertainty; and 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. for the minima, the afternoon ebb\r\nbeing most true to its time, except during the rains.\r\n\r\nAt 9.50 a.m. the barometer is at its highest, and falls till 4 p.m.,\r\nwhen it stands on the average of the year 0·074 of an inch lower;\r\nduring the same period the Calcutta fall is upwards of one-tenth of an\r\ninch (0·121 Prinsep).\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that at considerable elevations in Europe, the hours\r\nof periodic ebb and flow differ materially from those which prevail at\r\nthe level of the sea; but this is certainly not the case in the Sikkim\r\nHimalaya.\r\n\r\nThe amplitude decreases in amount from 0·100 at the foot of the hills,\r\nto 0·074 at 7000 feet; and the mean of 132 selected unexceptionable\r\nobservations, taken at nine stations between 8000 and 15,500 feet, at\r\n9.50 a.m. and 4 p.m., gives an average fall of 0·056 of an inch; a\r\nresult which is confirmed by interpolation from numerous horary\r\nobservations at these and many other elevations, where I could observe\r\nat the critical hours.\r\n\r\nThat the Calcutta amplitude is not exceptionally great, is shewn by the\r\nregister kept at different places in the Gangetic valley and plains of\r\nIndia, between Saharunpore and the Bay of Bengal. I have seen\r\napparently trustworthy records of seven[419] such, and find that in all\r\nit amounts to between 0·084 and 0·120 inch, the mean of the whole being\r\n0·101 of an inch.\r\n\r\n [419] Calcutta, Berampore, Benares, Nagpore, Moozufferpore, Delhi, and\r\n Saharunpore.\r\n\r\nThe amplitude is greatest (0·088) in the spring months (March, April,\r\nand May), both at Dorjiling and Calcutta: it is least at both in June\r\nand July, (0·027 at Dorjiling), and rises again in autumn (to ·082 in\r\nSeptember).\r\n\r\nThe horary oscillations also are as remarkably uniform at all\r\nelevations, as the period of ebb and flow: the mercury falls slowly\r\nfrom 9.50 a.m. (when it is at its highest) till noon, then rapidly till\r\n3 p.m., and slowly again till 4 p.m.; after which there is little\r\nchange until sunset; it rises rapidly between 7 and 9 p.m., and a\r\nlittle more till 10 p.m.; thence till 4 a.m. the fall is\r\ninconsiderable, and the great rise occurs between 7 and 9 a.m.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that these fluctuations of the barometer are due to\r\nthe expansion and contraction by heat and moisture of the column of\r\natmosphere that presses on the mercury, in the cistern of the\r\ninstrument: were the air dry, the effect would be a single rise and\r\nfall;[420] the barometer would stand highest at the hottest of the\r\ntwenty-four hours, and lowest at the coldest; and such is the case in\r\narid continental regions which are perennially dry. That such would\r\nalso be the case at Calcutta and throughout the Himalaya of Sikkim, is\r\ntheoretically self-evident, and proved by my horary observations taken\r\nduring the rainy months of 1848. An inspection of these at the end of\r\nthis section (where a column contains the pressure of dry air) shows\r\nbut one maximum of pressure, which occurs at the coldest time of the\r\ntwenty-four hours (early in the morning), and one minimum in the\r\nafternoon. In the table of mean temperatures of the months, also\r\nappended to this section, will also be found a column allowing the\r\npressure of dry air, whence it will be seen that there is but one\r\nmaximum of the pressure of dry air, occurring at the coldest season in\r\nDecember, and one minimum, in July. The effect of the vapour is the\r\nsame on the annual as upon the diurnal march of the pressure, producing\r\na double maximum and minimum in the year in one case, and in the\r\ntwenty-four hours in the other.\r\n\r\n [420] This law, for which we are indebted to Professor Dove, has been\r\n clearly explained by Colonel Sabine in the appendix to his translation\r\n of Humboldt’s “Cosmos,” vol. i. p. 457.\r\n\r\n\r\nI append a meteorological register of the separate months, but at the\r\nsame time must remind the reader that it does not pretend to strict\r\naccuracy. It is founded upon observations made at Dorjiling by Dr.\r\nChapman in the year 1837, for pressure temperature and wet-bulb only;\r\nthe other data and some modifications of the above are supplied from\r\nobservations of my own. Those for terrestrial and nocturnal radiation\r\nare accurate as far as they go, that is to say, they are absolute\r\ntemperatures taken by myself, which may, I believe, be recorded in any\r\nyear, but much higher are no doubt often to be obtained. The dew-points\r\nand saturations are generally calculated from the mean of two day\r\nobservations (10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) of the wet-bulb thermometer, together\r\nwith the minimum, or are taken from observations of Daniell’s\r\nhygrometer; and as I find the mean of the temperature of 10 a.m., 4\r\np.m., and the minimum, to coincide within a few tenths with the mean\r\ntemperature of the whole day, I assume that the mean of the wet-bulb\r\nobservations of the same hours will give a near approach to that of the\r\ntwenty-four hours. The climate of Dorjiling station has been in some\r\ndegree altered by extensive clearances of forest, which render it more\r\nvariable, more exposed to night frosts and strong sun-heat, and to\r\ndrought, the drying up of small streams being one direct consequence.\r\nMy own observations were taken at Mr. Hodgson’s house, elevated 7,430\r\nfeet, the position of which I have indicated at the commencement of\r\nthis section, where the differences of climate due to local causes are\r\nsufficiently indicated to show that in no two spots could similar\r\nmeteorological results be obtained. At Mr. Hodgson’s, for instance, the\r\nuniformity of temperature and humidity is infinitely more remarkable\r\nthan at Dr. Chapman’s, possibly from my guarding more effectually\r\nagainst radiation, and from the greater forests about Mr. Hodgson’s\r\nhouse. I have not, however, ventured to interfere with the temperature\r\ncolumns on this account.\r\n\r\n\r\nDORJILING METEOROLOGICAL REGISTER.\r\n\r\n  Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr.

I need hardly remind my reader that the\r\nvapour-charged wind of Sikkim is the southerly one, which blows over\r\nCalcutta; that in its passage northwards to Sikkim in the summer\r\nmonths, it traverses the heated plains at the foot of the Himalaya, and\r\nascending that range, it discharges the greater part of its moisture\r\n(120 to 140 inches annually) over the outer Himalayan ranges, at\r\nelevations of 4000 to 8000 feet. The cooling effect of the uniform\r\ncovering of forest on the Sikkim ranges is particularly favourable to\r\nthis deposition, but the slope of the mountains being gradual, the\r\nascending currents are not arrested and cooled so suddenly as in the\r\nKhasia mountains, where the discharge is consequently much greater. The\r\nheating of the atmosphere, too, over the dry plains at the foot of the\r\nouter range, increases farther its capacity for the retention of\r\nvapour, and also tends to render the rain-fall less sudden and violent\r\nthan on the Khasia, where the south wind blows over the cool expanse of\r\nthe Jheels. It will be seen from the following observations, that in\r\nSikkim the relative humidity of the atmosphere remains pretty\r\nconstantly very high in the summer months, and at all elevations,\r\nexcept in the rearward valleys; and even there a humid atmosphere\r\nprevails up to 14,000 feet, everywhere within the influence of the\r\nsnowy mountains. The uniformly high temperature which prevails\r\nthroughout the summer, even at elevations of 17,000 and 18,000 feet, is\r\nno doubt proximately due to the evolution of heat during the\r\ncondensation of these vapours. It will be seen by the pages of my\r\njournal, that continued sunshine, and the consequent heating of the\r\nsoil, is almost unknown during the summer, at any elevation on the\r\nouter or southward ranges of Dorjiling: but the sunk thermometer proves\r\nthat in advancing northward into the heart of the mountains and\r\nascending, the sun’s effect is increased, the temperature of the earth\r\nbecoming in summer considerably higher than that of the air. With\r\nregard to the observations themselves, they may be depended upon as\r\ncomparable with those of Calcutta, the instruments having been\r\ncarefully compared, and the cases of interpolation being few. The\r\nnumber of observations taken at each station is recorded in a separate\r\ncolumn; where only one is thus recorded, it is not to be regarded as a\r\nsingle reading, but the mean, of several taken during an hour or longer\r\nperiod. I have rejected all solitary observations, even when\r\naccompanied by others at Calcutta; and sundry that were, for obvious\r\nreasons, likely to mislead. Where many observations were taken at one\r\nplace, I have divided them into sets, corresponding to the hours at\r\nwhich alone the Calcutta temperature and wet-bulb thermometer are\r\nrecorded,[423] in order that meteorologists may apply them to the\r\nsolution of other questions relating to the distribution of heat and\r\nmoisture. The Dorjiling observations, and those in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of that station, appeared to me sufficiently numerous to\r\nrender it worth while classing them in months, and keeping them in a\r\nseries by themselves. The tensions of vapour are worked from the\r\nwet-bulb readings by Apjohn’s formula and tables, corrected for the\r\nheight of the barometer at the time. The observations, except where\r\notherwise noted, are taken by myself.\r\n\r\n [423] Sunrise; 9.50 a.m.; noon; 2.40 p.m.; 4 p.m., and sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES I. _Observations made at or near Dorjiling._\r\n\r\nJANUARY, 1849\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDORJILING CALCUTTA No.\r\nof\r\nObs.

As the southerly current, to which alone is due\r\nall the moisture of Sikkim, traverses 200 miles of land, and discharges\r\nfrom sixty to eighty inches of rain before arriving at Dorjiling, it\r\nfollows that the whole atmospheric column is relatively drier over the\r\nHimalaya than over Calcutta; that the absolute amount of vapour, in\r\nshort, is less than it would otherwise be at the elevation of\r\nDorjiling, though the relative humidity is so great. A glance at the\r\ntable at the end of this section appears to confirm this; for it is\r\nthere shown that, at the base of the Himalaya, at an elevation of only\r\n250 feet higher than Calcutta, the absolute amount of vapour is less,\r\nand of relative humidity greater, than at Calcutta.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES II. _Observations at various Stations and Elevations in the\r\nHimalaya of East Nepal and Sikkim._\r\n\r\nELEVATION 735 TO 2000 FEET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST NEPAL AND SIKKIM CALCUTTA No.\r\nof\r\nObs.

Up to 12,000 feet\r\nthis constant humidity is very marked; the observations made at greater\r\nelevations were almost invariably to the north, or leeward of the great\r\nsnowy peaks, and consequently in a drier climate; and there it will be\r\nseen that these proportions are occasionally inverted; and in Tibet\r\nitself a degree of relative dryness is encountered, such as is never\r\nequalled on the plains of Eastern Bengal or the Gangetic delta. Whether\r\nan isolated peak rising near Calcutta, to the elevation of 19,000 feet,\r\nwould present similar results to the above, is not proven by these\r\nobservations, but as the relative humidity is the same at all\r\nelevations on the outermost ranges of Sikkim, which attain 10,000 feet,\r\nand as these rise from the plains like steep islands out of the ocean,\r\nit may be presumed that the effects of elevation would be the same in\r\nboth cases.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of this humid wind is to clothe Sikkim with forests,\r\nthat make it moister still; and however difficult it is to separate\r\ncause from effect in such cases as those of the reciprocal action of\r\nhumidity on vegetation, and vegetation on humidity, it is necessary for\r\nthe observer to consider the one as the effect of the other. There is\r\nno doubt that but for the humidity of the region, the Sikkim Himalaya\r\nwould not present the uniform clothing of forest that it does; and, on\r\nthe other hand, that but for this vegetation, the relative humidity\r\nwould not be so great.[433]\r\n\r\n [433] Balloon ascents and observations on small mountainous islands,\r\n therefore, offer the best means of solving such questions: of these,\r\n the results of ballooning, under Mr. Welsh’s intrepid and skilful\r\n pioneering (see Phil. Trans. for 1853), have proved most satisfactory;\r\n though, from the time for observation being short, and from the\r\n interference of belts of vapour, some anomalies have not been\r\n eliminated. Islands again are still more exposed to local influences,\r\n which may be easily eliminated in a long series of observations. I\r\n think that were two islands, as different in their physical characters\r\n as St. Helena and Ascension, selected for comparative observations, at\r\n various elevations, the laws that regulate the distribution of\r\n humidity in the upper regions might be deduced without difficulty.\r\n They are advantageous sites, from differing remarkably in their\r\n humidity. Owing partly to the indestructible nature of its component\r\n rock (a glassy basalt), the lower parts of Ascension have never\r\n yielded to the corroding effects of the moist sea air which surrounds\r\n it; which has decomposed the upper part into a deep bed of clay. Hence\r\n Ascension does not support a native tree, or even shrub, two feet\r\n high. St. Helena, on the other hand, which can hardly be considered\r\n more favourably situated for humidity, was clothed with a redundant\r\n vegetation when discovered, and trees and tree-ferns (types of\r\n humidity) still spread over its loftiest summits. Here the humidity,\r\n vegetation, and mineral and mechanical composition reciprocate their\r\n influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great amount of relative humidity registered at 6000 to 8000 feet,\r\narises from most of the observations having been made on the outer\r\nrange, where the atmosphere is surcharged. The majority of those at\r\n10,000 to 12,000 feet, which also give a disproportionate amount of\r\nhumidity, were registered at the Zemu and Thlonok rivers, where the\r\nnarrowness of the valleys, the proximity of great snowy peaks, and the\r\nrank luxuriance of the vegetation, all favour a humid atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI would have added the relative rain-fall to the above, but this is so\r\nvery local a phenomenon, and my observations were so repeatedly\r\nderanged by having to camp in forests, and by local obstacles of all\r\nkinds, that I have suppressed them; their general results I have given\r\nin Appendix F.\r\n\r\nI here add a few observations, taken on the plains at the foot of the\r\nSikkim Himalaya during the spring months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparison between Temperature and Humidity of the Sikkim Terai and\r\nCalcutta, in March and April, 1849._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nof\r\nObs.

After the rains commence; I believe\r\nthat this is in a great measure inverted, the plains becoming\r\nexcessively heated, and the temperature being higher than at Calcutta.\r\nThis indeed follows from the well known fact that the summer heat\r\nincreases greatly in advancing north-west from the Bay of Bengal to the\r\ntrans-Sutledge regions; it is admirably expressed in the maps of Dove’s\r\ngreat work “On the Distribution of Heat on the Surface of the Globe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.\r\n\r\nON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SOIL AT VARIOUS ELEVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese observations were taken by burying a brass tube two feet six\r\ninches to three feet deep, in exposed soil, and sinking in it, by a\r\nstring or tied to a slip of wood, a thermometer whose bulb was well\r\npadded with wool: this, after a few hours’ rest, indicates the\r\ntemperature of the soil. Such a tube and thermometer I usually caused\r\nto be sunk wherever I halted, if even for one night, except during the\r\nheight of the rains, which are so heavy that they communicate to the\r\nearth a temperature considerably above that of the air.\r\n\r\nThe results proved that the temperature of the soil at Dorjiling varies\r\nwith that of the month, from 46° to 62·2°, but is hardly affected by\r\nthe diurnal variation, except in extreme cases. In summer, throughout\r\nthe rains, May to October, the temperature is that of the month, which\r\nis imparted by the rain to the depth of eleven feet during heavy\r\ncontinued falls (of six to twelve inches a day), on which occasions I\r\nhave seen the buried thermometer indicating a temperature above the\r\nmean of the month. Again, in the winter months, December and January,\r\nit stands 5° above the monthly mean; in November and February 4° to 5°;\r\nin March a few degrees below the mean temperature of the month, and in\r\nOctober above it; April and May being sunny, it stands above their\r\nmean; June to September a little below the mean temperature of each\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the soil is affected by:—1. The exposure of the\r\nsurface; 2. The nature of the soil; 3. Its permeability by rain, and\r\nthe presence of underground springs; 4. The sun’s declination; 5. The\r\nelevation above the sea, and consequently the heating power of the\r\nsun’s rays: and 6, The amount of cloud and sunshine. far from being\r\nsufficient to supply data for the exact estimation of the effects of\r\nthe sun on the soil at any elevation or locality; they, however,\r\nindicate with tolerable certainty the main features of this phenomenon,\r\nand these are in entire conformity with more ample series obtained\r\nelsewhere. The result, which at first sight appears the most anomalous,\r\nis, that the mean temperature of the soil, at two or three feet depth,\r\nis almost throughout the year in India above that of the surrounding\r\natmosphere. This has been also ascertained to be the case in England by\r\nseveral observers, and the carefully conducted observations of Mr.\r\nRobert Thompson at the Horticultural Society’s Gardens at Chiswick,\r\nshow that the temperature of the soil at that place is, on the mean of\r\nsix years, at the depth of one foot, 1° above that of the air, and at\r\ntwo feet 1·5°. During the winter months the soil is considerably (l° to\r\n3°) warmer than the air, and during summer the soil is a fraction of a\r\ndegree cooler than the air.\r\n\r\nIn India, the sun’s declination being greater, these effects are much\r\nexaggerated, the soil on the plains being in winter sometimes 9° hotter\r\nthan the air; and at considerable elevations in the Himalaya very much\r\nmore than that; in summer also, the temperature of the soil seldom\r\nfalls below that of the air, except where copious rain-falls\r\ncommunicate a low temperature, or where forests interfere with the\r\nsun’s rays.\r\n\r\nAt considerable elevations these effects are so greatly increased, that\r\nit is extremely probable that at certain localities the mean\r\ntemperature of the soil may be even 10° warmer than that of the air;\r\nthus, at Jongri, elevation 13,194 feet, the soil in January was 34·5°,\r\nor 19·2° above the mean temperature of the month, immediately before\r\nthe ground became covered with snow for the remainder of the winter;\r\nduring the three succeeding months, therefore, the temperature of the\r\nsoil probably does not fall below that of the snow, whilst the mean\r\ntemperature of the air in January may be estimated at about 20°,\r\nFebruary 22°, March 30°, and April 35°. If, again, we assume the\r\ntemperature of the soil of Jongri to be that of other Sikkim localities\r\nbetween 10,000 and 14,000 feet, we may assume the soil to be warmer by\r\n10° in July (see Tungu observations), by 8° or 9° in September (see\r\nYeumtong); by l0° in October (see Tungu); and by 7° to l0° in November\r\n(see Wallanchoon and Nanki). These temperatures, however, vary\r\nextremely according to exposure and amount of sunshine; and I should\r\nexpect that the greatest differences would be found in the sunny\r\nclimate of Tibet, where the sun’s heat is most powerful. Were nocturnal\r\nor terrestrial radiation as constant and powerful as solar, the effects\r\nof the latter would be neutralised; but such is not the case at any\r\nelevation in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThis accumulated heat in the upper strata of soil must have a very\r\npowerful effect upon vegetation, preventing the delicate rootlets of\r\nshrubs from becoming frozen, and preserving vitality in the more\r\nfleshy, roots, such as those of the large rhubarbs and small orchids,\r\nwhose spongy cellular tissues would no doubt be ruptured by severe\r\nfrosts. To the burrowing rodents, the hares, marmots, and rats, which\r\nabound at 15,000 to 17,000 feet in Tibet, this phenomenon is even more\r\nconspicuously important; for were the soil in winter to acquire the\r\nmean temperature of the air, it would take very long to heat after the\r\nmelting of the snow, and indeed the latter phenomenon would be greatly\r\nretarded. The rapid development of vegetation after the disappearance\r\nof the snow, is no doubt also proximately due to the heat of the soil,\r\nquite as much as to the increased strength of the sun’s direct rays in\r\nlofty regions.\r\n\r\nI have given in the column following that containing the temperature of\r\nthe sunk thermometer, first the extreme temperatures of the air\r\nrecorded during the time the instrument was sunk; and in the next\r\nfollowing, the mean temperature of the air during the same period, so\r\nfar as I could ascertain it from my own observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES I. _Soane Valley_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocality Date Eleva-\r\ntion\r\n(feet) Depth\r\n(ft. in.)

The results of several sets of\r\nobservations are grouped together, but show so great an amount of\r\ndiscrepancy, that it is evident that a long series of months and the\r\nselection of several stations are necessary in a mountain country to\r\narrive at any accurate results. Even at the stations where the most\r\nnumerous and the most trustworthy observations were recorded, the\r\nresults of different months differ extremely; and with regard to the\r\nother stations, where few observations were taken, each one is affected\r\ndifferently from another at the same level with it, by the presence or\r\nproximity of forest, by exposure to the east or west, to ascending or\r\ndescending currents in the valleys, and to cloud or sunshine. Other and\r\nstill more important modifying influences are to be traced to the\r\nmonthly variations in the amount of humidity in the air and the\r\nstrength of its currents, to radiation, and to the evolution of heat\r\nwhich accompanies condensation raising the temperature of elevated\r\nregions during the rainy season. The proximity of large masses of snow\r\nhas not the influence I should have expected in lowering the\r\ntemperature of the surrounding atmosphere, partly no doubt because of\r\nthe more rapid condensation of vapours which it effects, and partly\r\nbecause of the free circulation of the currents around it. The\r\ndifference between the temperatures of adjacent grassy and naked or\r\nrocky spots, on the other hand, is very great indeed, the former soon\r\nbecoming powerfully heated in lofty regions where the sun’s rays pass\r\nthrough a rarefied atmosphere, and the rocks especially radiating much\r\nof the heat thus accumulated, for long after sunset. In various parts\r\nof my journals I have alluded to other disturbing causes, which being\r\nall more or leas familiar to meteorologists, I need not recapitulate\r\nhere. Their combined effects raise all the summer temperatures above\r\nwhat they should theoretically be.\r\n\r\nIn taking Calcutta as a standard of comparison, I have been guided by\r\ntwo circumstances; first, the necessity of selecting a spot where\r\nobservations were regularly and accurately made; and secondly, the\r\nbeing able to satisfy myself by a comparison of my instruments that the\r\nresults should be so far strictly comparable.\r\n\r\nI have allowed 1° Fahr. for every degree in latitude intervening\r\nbetween Sikkim and Calcutta, as the probable ratio of diminution of\r\ntemperature. So far as my observations made in east Bengal and in\r\nvarious parts of the Gangetic delta afford a means of solving this\r\nquestion, this is a near approximation to the truth. The spring\r\nobservations however which I have made at the foot of the Sikkim\r\nHimalaya would indicate a much more rapid decrement; the mean\r\ntemperature of Titalya and other parts of the plains south of the\r\nforests, between March and May being certainly 6°–9° lower than\r\nCalcutta: this period however is marked by north-west and north-east\r\nwinds, and by a strong haze which prevents the sun’s rays from\r\nimpinging on the soil with any effect. During the southerly winds, the\r\nsame region is probably hotter than Calcutta, there being but scanty\r\nvegetation, and the rain-fall being moderate.\r\n\r\nIn the following observations solitary readings are always rejected.\r\n\r\nI.—_Summer or Rainy Season observations at Dorjiling._\r\n\r\nObservations taken during the rainy season of 1848, at Mr. Hodgson’s\r\n(Jillapahar, Dorjiling) alt. 7,430 feet, exposure free to the north\r\neast and west, the slopes all round covered with heavy timber; much\r\nmist hence hangs over the station.

The increase\r\nwith the elevation, of the three succeeding sets, arises from the fact\r\nthat the loftier regions are far within the mountain region, and are\r\nless forest clad and more sunny than the outer Himalaya.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of observations were taken during this journey at\r\nnight, when none are recorded at Calcutta, but which are comparable\r\nwith contemporaneous observations taken by Mr. Muller at Dorjiling.\r\nThese being all taken during the three most rainy months, when the\r\ntemperature varies but very little during the whole twenty-four hours,\r\nI expected satisfactory results, but they proved very irregular and\r\nanomalous.\r\n\r\nThe means were—\r\n           At 21 stations of greater elevation than Dorjiling 1°=348\r\n           ft.\r\n           At 17 stations lower in elevation 1°=447 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.—_Sixty-four contemporaneous observations at Jillapahar, 7,430 feet,\r\nand the bed of the Great Rungeet river, 818 feet; taken in January and\r\nFebruary, give 1°=322 feet._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.—_Observations taken by burying a thermometer two and a half to\r\nthree feet deep, in a brass tube, at Dorjiling and at various\r\nelevations near that station._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonth Upper Stations Lower Stations February and March\r\nFebruary\r\n\r\nApril\r\nApril\r\nMarch and April\r\nMarch, April, May Jillapahar, 7,430 ft.\r\n    Ditto\r\n\r\nLeebong, 6000 ft.\r\nJillapahar, 7,430 ft.\r\nKhersiong, 4,813 ft.\r\nJillapahar, 7,430 ft.

There is much discrepancy between the\r\nresults obtained at greater or less elevations than 7000 feet; but a\r\ncareful study of these, which I have arranged in every possible way,\r\nleads me to the conclusion that the proportion map be roughly indicated\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n1°=300 feet, for elevations from 1,000 to   8,000 feet.\r\n1°=320 feet, for elevations from   8,000 to 10,000 feet.\r\n1°=350 feet, for elevations from 10,000 to 14,000 feet.\r\n1°=400 feet, for elevations from 14,000 to 18,000 feet.\r\n\r\nVIII.—_Khasia mountain observations._\r\n\r\nDate Calcutta\r\nObs.

It indicates a considerably higher temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere, and is probably attributable to the evolution of heat\r\nduring extraordinary rain-fall, and to the formation of the surface,\r\nwhich is a very undulating table-land, and everywhere traversed by\r\nbroad deep valleys, with very steep, often precipitous flanks; these\r\nget heated by the powerful sun, and from them, powerful currents\r\nascend. The scanty covering of herbage too over a great amount of the\r\nsurface, and the consequent radiation of heat from the earth, must have\r\na sensible influence on the mean temperature of the summer months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.\r\n\r\nON THE MEASUREMENT OF ALTITUDES BY THE BOILING-POINT THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\nThe use of the boiling-point thermometer for the determination of\r\nelevations in mountainous countries appearing to me to be much\r\nunderrated, I have collected the observations which I was enabled to\r\ntake, and compared their results with barometrical ones.\r\n\r\nI had always three boiling-point thermometers in use, and for several\r\nmonths five; the instruments were constructed by Newman, Dollond,\r\nTroughton, and Simms, and Jones, and though all in one sense good\r\ninstruments, differed much from one another, and from the truth. Mr.\r\nWelsh has had the kindness to compare the three best instruments with\r\nthe standards at the Kew Observatory at various temperatures between\r\n180° and the boiling-point; from which comparison it appears, that an\r\nerror of l·5° may be found at some parts of the scale of instruments\r\nmost confidently vouched for by admirable makers. Dollond’s\r\nthermometer, which Dr. Thomson had used throughout his extensive west\r\nTibetan journeys, deviated but little from the truth at all ordinary\r\ntemperatures. All were so far good, that the errors, which were almost\r\nentirely attributable to carelessness in the adjustments, were\r\nconstant, or increased at a constant ratio throughout all parts of the\r\nscale; so that the results of the different instruments have, after\r\ncorrection, proved strictly comparable.\r\n\r\nThe kettle used was a copper one, supplied by Newman, with free escape\r\nfor the steam; it answered perfectly for all but very high elevations\r\nindeed, where, from the water boiling at very low temperatures, the\r\nmetal of the kettle, and consequently of the thermometer, often got\r\nheated above the temperature of the boiling water.\r\n\r\nI found that no confidence could be placed in observations taken at\r\ngreat elevations, by plunging the thermometer in open vessels of\r\nboiling water, however large or deep, the abstraction of heat from the\r\nsurface being so rapid, that the water, though boiling below, and hence\r\nbubbling above, is not uniformly of the same temperature throughout.\r\n\r\nIn the Himalaya I invariably used distilled, or snow or rain-water; but\r\noften as I have tried common river-water for comparison, I never found\r\nthat it made any difference in the temperature of the boiling-point.\r\nEven the mineral-spring water at Yeumtong, and the detritus-charged\r\nglacial streams, gave no difference, and I am hence satisfied that no\r\nobjection can be urged against river waters of ordinary purity.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions I found anomalous rises and falls in the column of\r\nmercury, for which I could not account, except theoretically, by\r\nassuming breaks in the column, which I failed to detect on lifting the\r\ninstrument out of the water; at other times, I observed that the column\r\nremained for several minutes stationary, below the true temperature of\r\nthe boiling water, and then suddenly rose to it. These are no doubt\r\ninstrumental defects, which I only mention as being sources of error\r\nagainst which the observer must be on the watch: they can only be\r\nguarded against by the use of two instruments.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the formula employed for deducing the altitude from a\r\nboiling-point observation, the same corrections are to a great extent\r\nnecessary as with barometric observations: if no account is taken of\r\nthe probable state of atmospheric pressure at the level of the sea at\r\nor near the place of observation, for the hour of the day and month of\r\nthe year, or for the latitude, it is obvious that errors of 600 to 1000\r\nfeet may be accumulated. I have elsewhere stated that the pressure at\r\nCalcutta varies nearly one inch (1000 feet), between July and January;\r\nthat the daily tide amounts to one-tenth of an inch (=100 feet); that\r\nthe multiplier for temperature is too great in the hot season and too\r\nsmall in the cold; and I have experimentally proved that more accuracy\r\nis to be obtained in measuring heights in Sikkim, by assuming the\r\nobserved Calcutta pressure and temperature to accord with that of the\r\nlevel of the sea in the latitude of Sikkim, than by employing a\r\ntheoretical pressure and temperature for the lower station.\r\n\r\nIn the following observations, the tables I used were those printed by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Boileau for the East India Company’s Magnetic\r\nObservatory at Simla, which are based upon Regnault’s Table of the\r\n‘Elastic Force of Vapour.’ The mean height of the barometrical column\r\nis assumed (from Bessel’s formula) to be 29·924 at temp. 32°, in lat.\r\n45°, which, differing only ·002 from the barometric height\r\ncorresponding to 212° Fahrenheit, as determined experimentally by\r\nRegnault, gives 29·921 as the pressure corresponding to 212° at the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe approximate height in feet corresponding to each degree of the\r\nboiling-point, is derived from Oltmann’s tables. The multipliers for\r\nthe mean temperature of the strata of atmosphere passed through, are\r\ncomputed for every degree Fahrenheit, by the formula for expansion\r\nusually employed, and given in Baily’s Astronomical Tables and Biot’s\r\nAstronomie Physique.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes it may be assumed that the traveller, in\r\ncountries where boiling-point observations are most desired, has never\r\nthe advantage of a contemporaneous boiling-point observation at a lower\r\nstation. The approximate difference in height is hence, in most cases,\r\ndeduced from the assumption, that the boiling-point temperature at the\r\nlevel of the sea, at the place of observation, is 212°, and that the\r\ncorresponding temperature of the air at the level of the sea is hotter\r\nby one degree for every 330 feet of difference in elevation. As,\r\nhowever, the temperature of boiling water at the level of the sea\r\nvaries at Calcutta between July and January almost from 210·7° to\r\n212·6°, I always took the Calcutta barometer observation at the day and\r\nhour of my boiling-point observation, and corrected my approximate\r\nheight by as many feet as correspond to the difference between the\r\nobserved height of the barometer at Calcutta and 29·921; this\r\ncorrection was almost invariably (always normally) subtractive in the\r\nsummer, often amounting to upwards of 400 feet: it was additive in\r\nwinter, and towards the equinoxes it was very trifling.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes I found it sufficient to assume the Calcutta\r\ntemperature of the air at the day and hour of observation to be that of\r\nthe level of the sea at the place of observation, and to take out the\r\nmultiplier, from the mean of this and of the temperature at the upper\r\nstation. As, however, 330 feet is a near approach to what I have shown\r\n(Appendix I) to be the mean equivalent of 1° for all elevations between\r\n6000 and 18,000 feet; and as the majority of my observations were taken\r\nbetween these elevations, it results that the mean of all the\r\nmultipliers employed in Sikkim for forty-four observations amounts to\r\n65·1° Fahrenheit, using the Calcutta and upper station observations,\r\nand 65·3° on the assumption of a fall of 1° for every 330 feet. To\r\nshow, however, how great an error may accrue in individual cases from\r\nusing the formula of 1° to 330, I may mention that on one occasion,\r\nbeing at an elevation of 12,000 feet, with a temperature of the air of\r\n70°, the error amounted to upwards of 220 feet, and as the same\r\ntemperature may be recorded at much greater elevations, it follows that\r\nin such cases the formula should not be employed without modification.\r\n\r\nA multitude of smaller errors, arising from anomalies in the\r\ndistribution of temperature, will be apparent on consulting my\r\nobservations on the temperature at various elevations in Sikkim;\r\npractically these are unavoidable. I have also calculated all my\r\nobservations according to Professor J. Forbes’s formula of 1°\r\ndifference of temperature of boiling-water, being the equivalent of 550\r\nfeet at all elevations. (See Ed. Phil. Trans., vol xv. p. 405.) The\r\nformula is certainly not applicable to the Sikkim Himalaya; on the\r\ncontrary, my observations show that the formula employed for Boileau’s\r\ntables gives at all ordinary elevations so very close an approach to\r\naccuracy on the mean of many observations, that no material improvement\r\nin its construction is to be anticipated.\r\n\r\nAt elevations below 4000 feet, elevations calculated from the\r\nboiling-point are not to be depended on; and Dr. Thomson remarked the\r\nsame in north-west India: above 17,000 feet also the observations are\r\nhazardous, except good shelter and a very steady fire is obtainable,\r\nowing to the heating of the metal above that of the water. At all other\r\nelevations a mean error of 100 feet is on the average what is to be\r\nexpected in ordinary cases. For the elevation of great mountain masses,\r\nand continuously elevated areas, I conceive that the results are as\r\ngood as barometrical ones; for the general purposes of botanical\r\ngeography, the boiling-point thermometer supersedes the barometer in\r\npoint of practical utility, for under every advantage, the transport of\r\na glass tube full of mercury, nearly three feet long, and cased in\r\nmetal, is a great drawback to the unrestrained motion of the traveller.\r\n\r\nIn the Khasia mountains I found, from the mean of twelve stations and\r\ntwenty-three observations, the multiplier as derived from the mean of\r\nthe temperature at the upper station and at Calcutta, to be 75.2°, and\r\nas deduced from the formula to be 73·1°. Here, however, the equivalent\r\nin feet for 1° temp. is in summer very high, being 1°=385 feet. (See\r\nAppendix I.) The mean of all the elevations worked by the boiling-point\r\nis upwards of 140 feet below those worked by the barometer.\r\n\r\nThe following observations are selected as having at the time been\r\nconsidered trustworthy, owing to the care with which they were taken,\r\ntheir repetition in several cases, and the presumed accuracy of the\r\nbarometrical or trigonometrical elevation with which they are compared.\r\nA small correction for the humidity of the air might have been\r\nintroduced with advantage, but as in most barometrical observations,\r\nthe calculations proceed on the assumption that the column of air is in\r\na mean state of saturation; as the climate of the upper station was\r\nalways very moist, and as most of the observations were taken during\r\nthe rains, this correction would be always additive, and would never\r\nexceed sixty feet.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the comparative results given below\r\nafford by no means a fair idea of the accuracy to be obtained by the\r\nboiling-point. Some of the differences in elevation are probably due to\r\nthe barometer. In other cases I may have read off the scale wrong, for\r\nhowever simple it seems to read off an instrument, those practically\r\nacquainted with their use know well how some errors almost become\r\nchronic, how with a certain familiar instrument the chance of error is\r\nvery great at one particular part of the scale, and how confusing it is\r\nto read off through steam alternately from several instruments whose\r\nscales are of different dimensions, are differently divided, and\r\ndifferently lettered; such causes of error are constitutional in\r\nindividual observers. Again, these observations are selected without\r\nany reference to other considerations but what I have stated above; the\r\nworst have been put in with the best. Had I been dependent on the\r\nboiling-point for determining my elevations, I should have observed it\r\noftener, or at stated periods whenever in camp, worked the greater\r\nelevations from the intermediate ones, as well as from Calcutta, and\r\nresorted to every system of interpolation. Even the following\r\nobservations would be amended considerably were I to have deduced the\r\nelevation by observations of the boiling-point at my camp, and added\r\nthe height of my camp, either from the boiling-point observations\r\nthere, or by barometer, but I thought it better to select the most\r\nindependent method of observation, and to make the level of the sea at\r\nCalcutta the only datum for a lower station.\r\n\r\nSERIES I.—_Sikkim Observations._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace Month Elevation\r\nby Barom.\r\nor\r\nTrigonom.

I may mention here that a\r\nsmall stock of ammonia-sulphate of copper in crystals should be\r\nsupplied with this instrument, also a wire and brush for cleaning, and\r\na bottle with liquid ammonia: all of which might be packed in the box.\r\n\r\nActive 6.568.

For the computations such\r\nobservations alone were selected as were comparable with\r\ncontemporaneous ones taken at the Calcutta Observatory, or as could, by\r\ninterpolation, be reduced to these, with considerable accuracy: the\r\nCalcutta temperatures have been assumed as those of the level of the\r\nsea, and eighteen feet have been added for the height of the Calcutta\r\nObservatory above the sea. I have introduced two standards of\r\ncomparison where attainable; namely, 1. A few trigonometrical data,\r\nchiefly of positions around Dorjiling, measured by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nWaugh, the Surveyor-General, also a few measured by Mr. Muller and\r\nmyself, in which we can put full confidence: and, 2. A number of\r\nelevations in Sikkim and East Nepal, computed by simultaneous barometer\r\nobservations, taken by Mr. Muller at Dorjiling. As the Dorjiling\r\nbarometer was in bad repair, I do not place so much confidence in these\r\ncomparisons as in those with Calcutta. The coincidence, however,\r\nbetween the mean of all the elevations computed by each method is very\r\nremarkable; the difference amounting to only thirty feet in\r\nninety-three elevations; the excess being in favour of those worked by\r\nDorjiling. As the Dorjiling observations were generally taken at night,\r\nor early in the morning, when the temperature is below the mean of the\r\nday, this excess in the resulting elevations would appear to prove,\r\nthat the temperature correction derived from assuming the Calcutta\r\nobservations to correspond with eighteen feet above the level of the\r\nsea at Sikkim, has not practically given rise to much error.\r\n\r\nI have not added the boiling-point observations, which afford a further\r\nmeans of testing the accuracy of the barometric computations; and which\r\nwill be found in section J of this Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Jillapahar is given as computed by observations taken\r\nin different months, and at different hours of the day; from which\r\nthere will be seen, that owing to the low temperature of sunrise in the\r\none case, and of January and October in the others, the result for\r\nthese times is always lowest.\r\n\r\nMost of the computations have been made by means of Oltmann’s tables,\r\nas drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel Boileau, and printed at the Magnetic\r\nObservatory, Simla; very many were worked also by Bessell’s tables in\r\nTaylor’s “Scientific Memoirs,” which, however, I found to give rather\r\ntoo high a result on the averages; and I have therefore rejected most\r\nof them, except in cases of great elevation and of remarkable humidity\r\nor dryness, when the mean saturation point is an element that should\r\nnot be disregarded in the computation. To these the letter B is\r\nprefixed. By far the majority of these elevations are not capable of\r\nverification within a few feet; many of them being of villages, which\r\noccupy several hundred feet of a hill slope: in such cases the\r\nintroduction of the refinement of the humidity correction was not worth\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\nSERIES I.—_Elevations on the Grand Trunk-road.
