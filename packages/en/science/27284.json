He sat opposite\r\nto me in the train going down, and my attention was first attracted to\r\nhim by the marked contrast between his appearance and his attire: he had\r\nnot thought fit to adopt the regulation costume for such occasions, and\r\nI think I never saw a man who had made himself more aggressively horsey.\r\nThe mark of the beast was sprinkled over his linen: he wore snaffle\r\nsleeve-links, a hard hunting-hat, a Newmarket coat, and extremely tight\r\ntrousers. And with all this, he fell as far short of the genuine\r\nsportsman as any stage super who ever wore his spurs upside down in a\r\nhunting-chorus. His expression was mild and inoffensive, and his watery\r\npale eyes and receding chin gave one the idea that he was hardly to be\r\ntrusted astride anything more spirited than a gold-headed cane. And yet,\r\nsomehow, he aroused compassion rather than any sense of the ludicrous:\r\nhe had that look of shrinking self-effacement which comes of a recent\r\nhumiliation, and, in spite of all extravagances, he was obviously a\r\ngentleman; while something in his manner indicated that his natural\r\ntendency would, once at all events, have been to avoid any kind of\r\nextremes.\r\n\r\nHe puzzled and interested me so much that I did my best to enter into\r\nconversation with him, only to be baffled by the jerky embarrassment\r\nwith which he met all advances, and when we got out at Esher, curiosity\r\nled me to keep him still in view.\r\n\r\nEvidently he had not come with any intention of making money. He avoided\r\nthe grand stand, with the bookmakers huddling in couples, like hoarse\r\nlovebirds; he kept away from the members' inclosure, where the Guards'\r\nband was endeavouring to defy the elements which emptied their vials\r\ninto the brazen instruments; he drifted listlessly about the course till\r\nthe clearing-bell rang, and it seemed as if he was searching for some\r\none whom he only wished to discover in order to avoid.\r\n\r\nSandown, it must be admitted, was not as gay as usual that day, with its\r\n'deluged park' and 'unsummer'd sky,' its waterproofed toilettes and\r\nmassed umbrellas, whose sides gleamed livid as they caught the\r\nlight--but there was a general determination to ignore the unseasonable\r\ndampness as far as possible, and an excitement over the main event of\r\nthe day which no downpour could quench.\r\n\r\nThe Ten Thousand was run: ladies with marvellously confected bonnets\r\nlowered their umbrellas without a murmur, and smart men on drags shook\r\nhands effusively as, amidst a frantic roar of delight, Bendigo strode\r\npast the post. The moment after, I looked round for my incongruous\r\nstranger, and saw him engaged in a well-meant attempt to press a currant\r\nbun upon a carriage-horse tethered to one of the trees--a feat of\r\nabstraction which, at such a time, was only surpassed by that of\r\nArchimedes at the sack of Syracuse.\r\n\r\nAfter that I could no longer control my curiosity--I felt I must speak\r\nto him again, and I made an opportunity later, as we stood alone on a\r\nstand which commanded the finish of one of the shorter courses, by\r\nsuggesting that he should share my umbrella.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting he glanced suspiciously at me through the rills that\r\nstreamed from his unprotected hat-brim. 'I'm afraid,' I said, 'it is\r\nrather like shutting the stable-door after the steed is stolen.'\r\n\r\nHe started. 'He _was_ stolen, then,' he cried; 'so you have heard?'\r\n\r\nI explained that I had only used an old proverb which I thought might\r\nappeal to him, and he sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n'I was misled for the moment,' he said: 'you have guessed, then, that I\r\nhave been accustomed to horses?'\r\n\r\n'You have hardly made any great secret of it.'\r\n\r\n'The fact is,' he said, instantly understanding this allusion to his\r\ncostume, 'I--I put on these things so as not to lose the habit of\r\nriding altogether--I have not been on horseback lately. At one time I\r\nused to ride constantly--constantly. I was a regular attendant in Rotten\r\nRow--until something occurred which shook my nerve, and I am only\r\nwaiting now for the shock to subside.'\r\n\r\nI did not like to ask any questions, and we walked back to the station,\r\nand travelled up to Waterloo in company, without any further reference\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nAs we were parting, however, he said, 'I wonder if you would care to\r\nhear my full story some day? I cannot help thinking it would interest\r\nyou, and it would be a relief to me.'\r\n\r\nI was ready enough to hear whatever he chose to tell me; and persuaded\r\nhim to dine with me at my rooms that evening, and unbosom himself\r\nafterwards, which he did to an extent for which I confess I was\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\nThat he himself implicitly believed in his own story, I could not doubt;\r\nand he told it throughout with the oddest mixture of vanity and modesty,\r\nand an obvious struggle between a dim perception of his own absurdity\r\nand the determination to spare himself in no single particular, which,\r\nthough it did not overcome my scepticism, could not fail to enlist\r\nsympathy. But for all that, by the time he entered upon the more\r\nsensational part of his case, I was driven to form conclusions\r\nrespecting it which, as they will probably force themselves upon the\r\nreader's own mind, I need not anticipate here.\r\n\r\nI give the story, as far as possible, in the words of its author; and\r\nhave only to add that it would never have been published here without\r\nhis full consent and approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n'My name,' said he, 'is Gustavus Pulvertoft. I have no occupation, and\r\nsix hundred a year. I lived a quiet and contented bachelor until I was\r\ntwenty-eight, and then I met Diana Chetwynd for the first time. We were\r\nspending Christmas at the same country-house, and it did not take me\r\nlong to become the most devoted of her many adorers. She was one of the\r\nmost variously accomplished girls I had ever met. She was a skilled\r\nmusician, a brilliant amateur actress; she could give most men thirty\r\nout of a hundred at billiards, and her judgment and daring across the\r\nmost difficult country had won her the warm admiration of all\r\nhunting-men. And she was neither fast nor horsey, seeming to find but\r\nlittle pleasure in the society of mere sportsmen, to whose conversation\r\nshe infinitely preferred that of persons who, like myself, were rather\r\nagreeable than athletic. I was not at that time, whatever I may be now,\r\nwithout my share of good looks, and for some reason it pleased Miss\r\nChetwynd to show me a degree of favour which she accorded to no other\r\nmember of the house-party.\r\n\r\nIt was annoying to feel that my unfamiliarity with the open-air sports\r\nin which she delighted debarred me from her company to so great an\r\nextent; for it often happened that I scarcely saw her until the evening,\r\nwhen I sometimes had the bliss of sitting next to her at dinner; but on\r\nthese occasions I could not help seeing that she found some pleasure in\r\nmy society.\r\n\r\nI don't think I have mentioned that, besides being exquisitely lovely,\r\nDiana was an heiress, and it was not without a sense of my own\r\npresumption that I allowed myself to entertain the hope of winning her\r\nat some future day. Still, I was not absolutely penniless, and she was\r\nher own mistress, and I had some cause, as I have said, for believing\r\nthat she was, at least, not ill-disposed towards me. It seemed a\r\nfavourable sign, for instance, when she asked me one day why it was I\r\nnever rode. I replied that I had not ridden for years--though I did not\r\nadd that the exact number of those years was twenty-eight.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but you must take it up again!' she said, with the prettiest air of\r\nimperiousness. 'You ought to ride in the Row next season.'\r\n\r\n'If I did,' I said, 'would you let me ride with you sometimes?'\r\n\r\n'We should meet, of course,' she said; 'and it is such a pity not to\r\nkeep up your riding--you lose so much by not doing so.'\r\n\r\nWas I wrong in taking this as an intimation that, by following her\r\nadvice, I should not lose my reward? If you had seen her face as she\r\nspoke, you would have thought as I did then--as I do now.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with this incentive, I overcame any private misgivings, and soon\r\nafter my return to town attended a fashionable riding-school near Hyde\r\nPark, with the fixed determination to acquire the whole art and mystery\r\nof horsemanship.\r\n\r\nThat I found learning a pleasure I cannot conscientiously declare. I\r\nhave passed happier hours than those I spent in cantering round four\r\nbare whitewashed walls on a snorting horse, with my interdicted stirrups\r\ncrossed upon the saddle. The riding-master informed me from time to time\r\nthat I was getting on, and I knew instinctively when I was coming off;\r\nbut I must have made some progress, for my instructor became more\r\nencouraging. 'Why, when you come here first, Mr. Pulvertoft, sir, you\r\nwere like a pair o' tongs on a wall, as they say; whereas now--well, you\r\ncan tell yourself how you are,' he would say; though, even then, I\r\noccasionally had reason to regret that I was _not_ on a wall. However, I\r\npersevered, inspired by the thought that each fresh horse I crossed (and\r\nsome were very fresh indeed) represented one more barrier surmounted\r\nbetween myself and Diana, and encouraged by the discovery, after\r\nrepeated experiments, that tan was rather soothing to fall upon than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen I walked in the Row, where a few horsemen were performing as\r\nharbingers of spring, I criticised their riding, which I thought\r\nindifferent, as they neglected nearly all the rules. I began to\r\nanticipate a day when I should exhibit a purer and more classic style of\r\nequestrianism. And one morning I saw Diana, who pulled up her dancing\r\nmare to ask me if I had remembered her advice, and I felt proudly able\r\nto reply that I should certainly make my appearance in the Row before\r\nvery long.\r\n\r\nFrom that day I was perpetually questioning my riding-master as to when\r\nhe considered I should be ripe enough for Rotten Row. He was dubious,\r\nbut not actually dissuasive. 'It's like this, you see, sir,' he\r\nexplained, 'if you get hold of a quiet, steady horse--why, you won't\r\ncome to no harm; but if you go out on an animal that will take advantage\r\nof you, Mr. Pulvertoft, why, you'll be all no-how on him, sir.'\r\n\r\nThey would have mounted me at the school; but I knew most of the stud\r\nthere, and none of them quite came up to my ideal of a 'quiet, steady\r\nhorse;' so I went to a neighbouring job-master, from whom I had\r\noccasionally hired a brougham, and asked to be shown an animal he could\r\nrecommend to one who had not had much practice lately. He admitted\r\ncandidly enough that most of his horses 'took a deal of riding,' but\r\nadded that it so happened that he had one just then which would suit me\r\n'down to the ground'--a phrase which grated unpleasantly on my nerves,\r\nthough I consented to see the horse. His aspect impressed me most\r\nfavourably. He was a chestnut of noble proportions, with a hogged mane;\r\nbut what reassured me was the expression of his eye, indicating as it\r\ndid a self-respect and sagacity which one would hardly expect for seven\r\nand sixpence an hour.\r\n\r\n'You won't get a showier Park 'ack than what he is, not to be so quiet,'\r\nsaid his owner. 'He's what you may call a kind 'oss, and as gentle--you\r\ncould ride him on a packthread.'\r\n\r\nI considered reins safer, but I was powerfully drawn towards the horse:\r\nhe seemed to me to be sensible that he had a character to lose, and to\r\npossess too high an intelligence wilfully to forfeit his testimonials.\r\nWith hardly a second thought, I engaged him for the following afternoon.\r\n\r\nI mounted at the stables, with just a passing qualm, perhaps, while my\r\nstirrup-leathers were being adjusted, and a little awkwardness in taking\r\nup my reins, which were more twisted than I could have wished; however,\r\nat length, I found myself embarked on the stream of traffic on the back\r\nof the chestnut--whose name, by the way, was Brutus.\r\n\r\nShall I ever forget the pride and ecstasy of finding that I had my steed\r\nunder perfect control, that we threaded the maze of carriages with\r\nabsolute security? I turned him into the Park, and clucked my tongue: he\r\nbroke into a canter, and how shall I describe my delight at the\r\ndiscovery that it was not uncomfortable? I said 'Woa,' and he stopped,\r\nso gradually that my equilibrium was not seriously disturbed; he\r\ntrotted, and still I accommodated myself to his movements without any\r\npositive inconvenience. I could have embraced him for gratitude: never\r\nbefore had I been upon a beast whose paces were so easy, whose behaviour\r\nwas so considerate. I could ride at last! or, which amounted to the same\r\nthing, I could ride the horse I was on, and I would 'use no other.' I\r\nwas about to meet Diana Chetwynd, and need not fear even to encounter\r\nher critical eyes.\r\n\r\nWe had crossed the Serpentine bridge, and were just turning in upon the\r\nRide, when--and here I am only too conscious that what I am about to say\r\nmay strike you as almost incredible--when I heard an unfamiliar voice\r\naddressing me with, 'I say--you!' and the moment afterwards realised\r\nthat it proceeded from my own horse!\r\n\r\nI am not ashamed to own that I was as nearly off as possible; for a more\r\npractised rider than I could pretend to be might have a difficulty in\r\npreserving his equanimity in this all but unparalleled situation. I was\r\ntoo much engaged in feeling for my left stirrup to make any reply, and\r\npresently the horse spoke once more. 'I say,' he inquired, and I failed\r\nto discern the slightest trace of respect in his tone--'do you think you\r\ncan ride?' You can judge for yourself how disconcerting the inquiry must\r\nhave been from such lips: I felt rooted to the saddle--a sensation\r\nwhich, with me, was sufficiently rare. I looked round in helpless\r\nbewilderment, at the shimmering Serpentine, and the white houses in Park\r\nLane gleaming out of a lilac haze, at the cocoa-coloured Row, and the\r\nflash of distant carriage-wheels in the sunlight: all looked as\r\nusual--and yet, there was I on the back of a horse which had just\r\ninquired 'whether I thought I could ride'!\r\n\r\n'I have had two dozen lessons at a riding-school,' I said at last, with\r\nrather a flabby dignity.\r\n\r\n'I should hardly have suspected it,' was his brutal retort. 'You are\r\nevidently one of the hopeless cases.'\r\n\r\nI was deeply hurt, the more so because I could not deny that he had some\r\nclaim to be a judge. 'I--I thought we were getting on so nicely\r\ntogether,' I faltered, and all he said in reply to that was, '_Did_\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'Do you know,' I began, striving to be conversational, 'I never was on a\r\nhorse that talked before.'\r\n\r\n'You are enough to make any horse talk,' he answered; 'but I suppose I\r\n_am_ an exception.'\r\n\r\n'I think you must be,' said I. 'The only horses I ever heard of as\r\npossessing the gift of speech were the Houyhnhnms.'\r\n\r\n'How do you know I am not one of them?' he replied.\r\n\r\n'If you are, you will understand that I took the liberty of mounting you\r\nunder a very pardonable mistake; and if you will have the goodness to\r\nstand still, I will no longer detain you.'\r\n\r\n'Not so fast,' said he: 'I want to know something more about you first.\r\nI should say now you were a man with plenty of oats.'\r\n\r\n'I am--well off,' I said. How I wished I was!\r\n\r\n'I have long been looking out for a proprietor who would not overwork\r\nme: now, of course, I don't know, but you scarcely strike me as a _hard_\r\nrider.'\r\n\r\n'I do not think I could be fairly accused of that,' I answered, with all\r\nthe consciousness of innocence.\r\n\r\n'Just so--then buy me.'\r\n\r\n'No,' I gasped: 'after the extremely candid opinion you were good enough\r\nto express of my riding, I'm surprised that you should even suggest such\r\na thing.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I will put up with that--you will suit me well enough, I dare say.'\r\n\r\n'You must excuse me. I prefer to keep my spare cash for worthier\r\nobjects; and, with your permission, I will spend the remainder of the\r\nafternoon on foot.'\r\n\r\n'You will do nothing of the sort,' said he.\r\n\r\n'If you won't stop, and let me get off properly,' I said with firmness,\r\n'I shall _roll_ off.' There were some promenaders within easy hail; but\r\nhow was I to word a call for help, how explain such a dilemma as mine?\r\n\r\n'You will only reduce me to the painful necessity of rolling on you,' he\r\nreplied. 'You must see that you are to a certain extent in my power.\r\nSuppose it occurred to me to leap those rails and take you into the\r\nSerpentine, or to run away and upset a mounted policeman with you--do\r\nyou think you could offer much opposition?'\r\n\r\nI could not honestly assert that I did. 'You were introduced to me,' I\r\nsaid reproachfully, 'as a _kind_ horse!'\r\n\r\n'And so I am--apart from matters of business. Come, will you buy, or be\r\nbolted with? I hate indecision!'\r\n\r\n'Buy!' I said, with commercial promptness. 'If you will take me back, I\r\nwill arrange about it at once.'\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that my one idea was to get safely off his back:\r\nafter which, neither honour nor law could require me to execute a\r\ncontract extorted from me by threats. But, as we were going down the\r\nmews, he said reflectively, 'I've been thinking--it will be better for\r\nall parties, if you make your offer to my proprietor _before_ you\r\ndismount.' I was too vexed to speak: this animal's infernal intelligence\r\nhad foreseen my manoeuvre--he meant to foil it, if he could.\r\n\r\nAnd then we clattered in under the glass-roofed yard of the livery\r\nstables; and the job-master, who was alone there, cast his eyes up at\r\nthe sickly-faced clock, as if he were comparing its pallor with my own.\r\n'Why, you _are_ home early, sir,' he said. 'You didn't find the 'orse\r\ntoo much for you, did you?' He said this without any suspicion of the\r\nreal truth; and, indeed, I may say, once for all, that this weird\r\nhorse--Houyhnhnm, or whatever else he might be--admitted no one but\r\nmyself into the secret of his marvellous gifts, and in all his\r\nconversations with me, managed (though how, I cannot pretend to say) to\r\navoid being overheard.\r\n\r\n'Oh, dear no,' I protested, 'he carried me admirably--admirably!' and I\r\nmade an attempt to slip off.\r\n\r\nNo such thing: Brutus instantly jogged my memory, and me, by the\r\nslightest suggestion of a 'buck.'\r\n\r\n'He's a grand 'orse, sir, isn't he?' said the job-master complacently.\r\n\r\n'M--magnificent!' I agreed, with a jerk. 'Will you go to his head,\r\nplease?'\r\n\r\nBut the horse backed into the centre of the yard, where he plunged with\r\na quiet obstinacy. 'I like him so much,' I called out, as I clung to the\r\nsaddle, 'that I want to know if you're at all inclined to part with\r\nhim?' Here Brutus became calm and attentive.\r\n\r\n'Would you be inclined to make me a orfer for him, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I said faintly. 'About how much would he be?'\r\n\r\n'You step into my orfice here, sir,' said he, 'and we'll talk it over.'\r\n\r\nI should have been only too willing, for there was no room there for the\r\nhorse, but the suspicious animal would not hear of it: he began to\r\nrevolve immediately.\r\n\r\n'Let us settle it now--here,' I said, 'I can't wait.'\r\n\r\nThe job-master stroked away a grin. No doubt there _was_ something\r\nunbusinesslike and unpractical in such precipitation, especially as\r\ncombined with my appearance at the time.\r\n\r\n'Well, you _'ave_ took a voilent fancy to the 'orse and no mistake,\r\nsir,' he remarked.\r\n\r\n'I never crossed a handsomer creature,' I said; which was hardly a\r\nprudent remark for an intending purchaser, but then, there was the\r\nanimal himself to be conciliated.\r\n\r\n'I don't know, really, as I can do without him just at this time of\r\nyear,' said the man. 'I'm under-'orsed as it is for the work I've got to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\nA sweet relief stole over me: I had done all that could be expected of\r\nme. 'I'm very sorry to hear that,' I said, preparing to dismount. 'That\r\n_is_ a disappointment; but if you can't there's an end of it.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you be afraid,' said Brutus, '_he'll_ sell me readily enough:\r\nmake him an offer, quick!'\r\n\r\n'I'll give you thirty guineas for him, come!' I said, knowing well\r\nenough that he would not take twice the money.\r\n\r\n'I thought a gentleman like you would have had more insight into the\r\nvalue of a 'orse,' he said: 'why, his action alone is worth that, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You couldn't let me have the action without the horse, I suppose?' I\r\nsaid, and I must have intended some joke.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to prolong a painful scene. Brutus ran me up steadily\r\nfrom sum to sum, until his owner said at last: 'Well, we won't 'aggle,\r\nsir, call it a hundred.'\r\n\r\nI had to call it a hundred, and what is more, it _was_ a hundred. I took\r\nhim without a warranty, without even a veterinary opinion. I could have\r\nbeen induced to take my purchase away then and there, as if I had been\r\nbuying a canary, so unaccustomed was I to transactions of this kind, and\r\nI am afraid the job-master considered me little better than a fool.\r\n\r\nSo I found myself the involuntary possessor of a Houyhnhnm, or something\r\neven worse, and I walked back to my rooms in Park Street in a state of\r\nstupor. What was I to do with him? To ride an animal so brutally\r\nplainspoken would be a continual penance; and yet, I should have to keep\r\nhim, for I knew he was cunning enough to outwit any attempt to dispose\r\nof him. And to this, Love and Ambition had led me! I could not, after\r\nall I had said, approach Diana with any confidence as a mere pedestrian:\r\nthe fact that I was in possession of a healthy horse which I never rode,\r\nwould be sure to leak out in time, and how was I to account for it? I\r\ncould see no way, and I groaned under an embarrassment which I dared not\r\nconfide to the friendliest ear. I hated the monster that had saddled\r\nhimself upon me, and looked in vain for any mode of escape.\r\n\r\nI had to provide Brutus with stabling in another part of the town, for\r\nhe proved exceedingly difficult to please: he found fault with\r\neverything, and I only wonder he did not demand that his stable should\r\nbe fitted up with blue china and mezzotints. In his new quarters I left\r\nhim for some days to his own devices: a course which I was glad to find,\r\non visiting him again, had considerably reduced his arrogance. He wanted\r\nto go in the Row and see the other horses, and it did not at all meet\r\nhis views to be exercised there by a stableman at unfashionable hours.\r\nSo he proposed a compromise. If I would only consent to mount him, he\r\nengaged to treat me with forbearance, and pointed out that he could give\r\nme, as he expressed it, various 'tips' which would improve my seat. I\r\nwas not blind to the advantages of such an arrangement. It is not every\r\none who secures a riding-master in the person of his own horse; the\r\nhorse is essentially a generous animal, and I felt that I might trust to\r\nBrutus's honour. And to do him justice, he observed the compact with\r\nstrict good faith. Some of his 'tips,' it is true, very nearly tipped me\r\noff, but their result was to bring us closer together; our relations\r\nwere less strained; it seemed to me that I gained more mastery over him\r\nevery day, and was less stiff afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut I was not allowed to enjoy this illusion long. One day when I\r\ninnocently asked him if he found my hands improving, he turned upon me\r\nhis off sardonic eye. 'You'll _never_ improve, old sack-of-beans' (for\r\nhe had come to address me with a freedom I burned to resent); 'hands!\r\nwhy, you're sawing my mouth off all the time. And your feet \"home,\" and\r\ntickling me under my shoulders at every stride--why, I'm half ashamed to\r\nbe seen about with you.'\r\n\r\nI was deeply hurt. 'I will spare you for the future,' I said coldly;\r\n'this is my last appearance.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense,' he said, 'you needn't show temper over it. Surely, if I can\r\nput up with it, _you_ can! But we will make a new compact.' (I never\r\nknew such a beast as he was for bargains!) 'You only worry me by\r\ninterfering with the reins. Let 'em out, and leave everything to me.\r\nJust mention from time to time where you want to go, and I'll attend to\r\nit,--if I've nothing better to do.'\r\n\r\nI felt that such an understanding was destructive of all dignity,\r\nsubverting, as it did, the natural relations between horse and rider;\r\nbut I had hardly any self-respect left, and I consented, since I saw no\r\nway of refusing. And on the whole, I cannot say, even now, that I had\r\nany grave reason for finding fault with the use Brutus made of my\r\nconcessions; he showed more tact than I could have expected in\r\ndisguising the merely nominal nature of my authority.\r\n\r\nI had only one serious complaint against him, which was that he had a\r\nhabit of breaking suddenly away, with a merely formal apology, to\r\nexchange equine civilities with some cob or mare, to whose owner I was a\r\nperfect stranger, thus driving me to invent the most desperate excuses\r\nto cover my seeming intrusion: but I managed to account for it in\r\nvarious ways, and even made a few acquaintances in this irregular and\r\ninvoluntary manner. I could have wished he had been a less susceptible\r\nanimal, for, though his flirtations were merely Platonic, it is rather\r\nhumiliating to have to play 'gooseberry' to one's own horse--a part\r\nwhich I was constantly being called upon to perform!\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Diana was away in Paris that Easter, and we had not met\r\nsince my appearance in the Row; but I knew she would be in town again\r\nshortly, and with consummate diplomacy I began to excite Brutus's\r\ncuriosity by sundry careless, half-slighting allusions to Miss\r\nChetwynd's little mare, Wild Rose. 'She's too frisky for my taste,' I\r\nsaid, 'but she's been a good deal admired, though I dare say you\r\nwouldn't be particularly struck by her.'\r\n\r\nSo that, on the first afternoon of Diana's return to the Row, I found it\r\neasy, under cover of giving Brutus an opportunity of forming an opinion,\r\nto prevail on him to carry me to her side. Diana, who was with a certain\r\nLady Verney, her chaperon, welcomed me with a charming smile.\r\n\r\n'I had no idea you could ride so well,' she said, 'you manage that\r\nbeautiful horse of yours so very easily--with such light hands, too.'\r\n\r\nThis was not irony, for I could now give my whole mind to my seat; and,\r\nas I never interfered at all with the steering apparatus, my hands must\r\nhave seemed the perfection of lightness.\r\n\r\n'He wants delicate handling,' I answered carelessly, 'but he goes very\r\nwell with _me_.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you would let me try his paces some morning, Pulvertoft,' struck\r\nin a Colonel Cockshott, who was riding with them, and whom I knew\r\nslightly: 'I've a notion he would go better on the curb.'\r\n\r\n'I shall be very happy,' I began, when, just in time, I noticed a\r\nwarning depression in Brutus's ears. The Colonel rode about sixteen\r\nstone, and with spurs! 'I mean,' I added hastily, 'I should have\r\nbeen--only, to tell you the truth, I couldn't conscientiously trust any\r\none on him but myself.'\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow!' said the Colonel, who I could see was offended, 'I've\r\nnot met many horses in my time that I couldn't get upon terms with.'\r\n\r\n'I think Mr. Pulvertoft is _quite_ right,' said Diana. 'When a horse\r\ngets accustomed to one he does so resent a strange hand: it spoils his\r\ntemper for days. I never will lend Wild Rose to anybody for that very\r\nreason!'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel fell back in the rear in a decided sulk. 'Poor dear Colonel\r\nCockshott!' said Diana, 'he is so proud of his riding, but _I_ think he\r\ndragoons a horse. I don't call that _riding_, do you?'\r\n\r\n'Well--hardly,' I agreed, with easy disparagement. 'I never believe in\r\nruling a horse by fear.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you are very fond of yours?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Fond is not the word!' I exclaimed--and it certainly was not.\r\n\r\n'I am not sure that what I said about lending Wild Rose would apply to\r\n_you_,' she said. 'I think you would be gentle with her.'\r\n\r\nI was certain that I should treat her with all consideration; but as I\r\ndoubted whether she would wholly reciprocate it, I said with much\r\npresence of mind, that I should regard riding her as akin to\r\nprofanation.\r\n\r\nAs Brutus and I were going home, he observed that it was a good thing I\r\nhad not agreed to lend him to the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I said, determined to improve the occasion, 'you might not have\r\nfound him as considerate as--well, as some people!'\r\n\r\n'I meant it was a good thing for _you_!' he hinted darkly, and I did not\r\ncare to ask for an explanation. 'What did you mean,' he resumed, 'by\r\nsaying that I should not admire Wild Rose? Why, she is\r\ncharming--charming!'\r\n\r\n'In that case,' I said, 'I don't mind riding with her mistress\r\noccasionally--to oblige you.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mind!' he said; 'you will _have_ to, my boy,--and every\r\nafternoon!'\r\n\r\nI suppressed a chuckle: after all, man _is_ the nobler animal. I could\r\nmanage a horse--in my own way. My little _ruse_ had succeeded: I should\r\nhave no more forced introductions to mystified strangers.\r\n\r\nAnd now for some weeks my life passed in a happy dream. I only lived for\r\nthose hours in the Row, where Brutus turned as naturally to Wild Rose as\r\nthe sunflower to the sun, and Diana and I grew more intimate every day.\r\nHappiness and security made me almost witty. I was merciless in my\r\nraillery of the eccentric exhibitions of horsemanship which were to be\r\nmet with, and Diana was provoked by my comments to the sweetest silvery\r\nlaughter. As for Colonel Cockshott, whom I had once suspected of a\r\ndesire to be my rival, he had long become a 'negligible quantity;' and\r\nif I delayed in asking Diana to trust me with her sweet self, it was\r\nonly because I found an epicurean pleasure in prolonging a suspense that\r\nwas so little uncertain.\r\n\r\nAnd then, without warning, my riding was interrupted for a while. Brutus\r\nwas discovered, much to his annoyance, to have a saddle-raw, and was\r\neven so unjust as to lay the blame on me, though, for my own part, I\r\nthought it a mark of apt, though tardy, retribution. I was not disposed\r\nto tempt Fortune upon any other mount, but I could not keep away from\r\nthe Row, nevertheless, and appeared there on foot. I saw Diana riding\r\nwith the Colonel, who seemed to think his opportunity had come at last;\r\nbut whenever she passed the railings on which I leaned, she would raise\r\nher eyebrows and draw her mouth down into a little curve of resigned\r\nboredom, which completely reassured me. Still, I was very glad when\r\nBrutus was well again, and we were cantering down the Row once more,\r\nboth in the highest spirits.\r\n\r\n'I never heard the horses here _whinny_ so much as they do this season,'\r\nI said, by way of making conversation. 'Can you account for it at all?'\r\nFor he sometimes gave me pieces of information which enabled me to\r\nimpress Diana afterwards by my intimate knowledge of horses.\r\n\r\n'Whinnying?' he said. 'They're _laughing_, that's what they're\r\ndoing--and no wonder!'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' said I, 'and what's the joke?'\r\n\r\n'Why, _you_ are!' he replied. 'You don't suppose you take _them_ in, do\r\nyou? They know all about you, bless your heart!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, do they?' I said blankly. This brute took a positive pleasure, I\r\nbelieve, in reducing my self-esteem.\r\n\r\n'I dare say it has got about through Wild Rose,' he continued. 'She was\r\nimmensely tickled when I told her. I'm afraid she must have been feeling\r\nrather dull all these days, by the bye.'\r\n\r\nI felt an unworthy impulse to take his conceit down as he had lowered\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n'Not so very, I think,' I said. 'She seemed to me to find that brown\r\nhunter of Colonel Cockshott's a very agreeable substitute.'\r\n\r\nLate as it is for reparation, I must acknowledge with shame that in\r\nuttering this insinuation, I did that poor little mare (for whom I\r\nentertained the highest respect) a shameful injustice; and I should like\r\nto state here, in the most solemn and emphatic manner, my sincere belief\r\nthat, from first to last, she conducted herself in a manner that should\r\nhave shielded her from all calumny.\r\n\r\nIt was only a mean desire to retaliate, a petty and ignoble spite, that\r\nprompted me thus to poison Brutus's confidence, and I regretted the\r\nwords as soon as I had uttered them.\r\n\r\n'That beast!' he said, starting as if I had touched him with a whip--a\r\nthing I never used--'why, he hasn't two ideas in his great fiddle-head.\r\nThe only sort of officer _he_ ought to carry is a Salvationist!'\r\n\r\n'I grant he has not your personal advantages and charm of manner,' I\r\nsaid. 'No doubt I was wrong to say anything about it.'\r\n\r\n'No,' he said, 'you--you have done me a service,' and he relapsed into a\r\nsombre silence.\r\n\r\nI was riding with Diana as usual, and was about to express my delight at\r\nbeing able to resume our companionship, when her mare drew slightly\r\nahead and lashed out suddenly, catching me on the left leg, and causing\r\nintense agony for the moment.\r\n\r\nDiana showed the sweetest concern, imploring me to go home in a cab at\r\nonce, while her groom took charge of Brutus. I declined the cab; but, as\r\nmy leg was really painful, and Brutus was showing an impatience I dared\r\nnot disregard, I had to leave her side.\r\n\r\nOn our way home, Brutus said moodily, 'It is all over between us--you\r\nsaw that?'\r\n\r\n'I felt it!' I replied. 'She nearly broke my leg.'\r\n\r\n'It was intended for me,' he said. 'It was her way of signifying that we\r\nhad better be strangers for the future. I taxed her with her\r\nfaithlessness; she denied it, of course--every mare does; we had an\r\nexplanation, and everything is at an end!'\r\n\r\nI did not ride him again for some days, and when I did, I found him\r\nsteeped in Byronic gloom. He even wanted at first to keep entirely on\r\nthe Bayswater side of the Park, though I succeeded in arguing him out of\r\nsuch weakness. 'Be a horse!' I said. 'Show her you don't care. You only\r\nflatter her by betraying your feelings.'\r\n\r\nThis was a subtlety that had evidently not occurred to him, but he was\r\nintelligent enough to feel the force of what I said. 'You are right,' he\r\nadmitted; 'you are not quite a fool in some respects. She shall see how\r\nlittle I care!'\r\n\r\nNaturally, after this, I expected to accompany Diana as usual, and it\r\nwas a bitter disappointment to me to find that Brutus would not hear of\r\ndoing so. He had an old acquaintance in the Park, a dapple-grey, who,\r\nprobably from some early disappointment was a confirmed cynic, and whose\r\nsociety he thought would be congenial just then. The grey was ridden\r\nregularly by a certain Miss Gittens, whose appearance as she titupped\r\nlaboriously up and down had often furnished Diana and myself with\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in spite of all my efforts, Brutus made straight to the grey. I\r\nwas not in such difficulties as might have been expected, for I happened\r\nto know Miss Gittens slightly, as a lady no longer in the bloom of\r\nyouth, who still retained a wiry form of girlishness. Though rather\r\ndisliking her than not, I found it necessary just then to throw some\r\nslight effusion into my greeting. She, not unnaturally perhaps, was\r\nflattered by my preference, and begged me to give her a little\r\ninstruction in riding, which--Heaven forgive me for it!--I took upon\r\nmyself to do.\r\n\r\nEven now I scarcely see how I could have acted otherwise: I could not\r\nleave her side until Brutus had exhausted the pleasures of cynicism with\r\nhis grey friend, and the time had to be filled up somehow. But, oh, the\r\ntorture of seeing Diana at a distance, and knowing that only a miserable\r\nmisunderstanding between our respective steeds kept us apart, feeling\r\nconstrained even to avoid looking in her direction, lest she should\r\nsummon me to her side!\r\n\r\nOne day, as I was riding with Miss Gittens, she glanced coyly at me\r\nover her sharp right shoulder, and said, 'Do you know, only such a\r\nlittle while ago, I never even dreamed that we should ever become as\r\nintimate as we are now; it seems almost incredible, does it not?'\r\n\r\n'You must not say so,' I replied. 'Surely there is nothing singular in\r\nmy helping you a little with your riding?' Though it struck me that it\r\nwould have been very singular if I had.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps not singular,' she murmured, looking modestly down her nose;\r\n'but will you think me very unmaidenly if I confess that, to me, those\r\nlessons have developed a dawning danger?'\r\n\r\n'You are perfectly safe on the grey,' I said.\r\n\r\n'I--I was not thinking of the grey,' she returned. 'Dear Mr. Pulvertoft,\r\nI must speak frankly--a girl has so many things to consider, and I am\r\nafraid you have made me forget how wrongly and thoughtlessly I have been\r\nbehaving of late. I cannot help suspecting that you must have some\r\nmotive in seeking my society in so--so marked a manner.'\r\n\r\n'Miss Gittens,' said I, 'I can disguise nothing: I have.'\r\n\r\n'And you have not been merely amusing yourself all this time?'\r\n\r\n'Before Heaven,' I cried with fervour, 'I have _not_!'\r\n\r\n'You are not one of those false men who give their bridle-reins a\r\nshake, and ride off with \"Adieu for evermore!\"--tell me you are not?'\r\n\r\nI might shake _my_ bridle-reins till I was tired and nothing would come\r\nof it unless Brutus was in the humour to depart; so that I was able to\r\nassure her with truth that I was not at all that kind of person.\r\n\r\n'Then why not let your heart speak?'\r\n\r\n'There is such a thing,' I said gloomily, 'as a heart that is gagged.'\r\n\r\n'Can no word, no hint of mine loosen the gag?' she wished to know.\r\n'What, you are silent still? Then, Mr. Pulvertoft, though I may seem\r\nharsh and cruel in saying it, our pleasant intercourse must end--we must\r\nride together no more!'\r\n\r\nNo more? What would Brutus say to that? I was horrified. 'Miss Gittens,'\r\nI said in great agitation, 'I entreat you to unsay those words. I--I am\r\nafraid I could not undertake to accept such a dismissal. Surely, after\r\nthat, you will not insist!'\r\n\r\nShe sighed. 'I am a weak, foolish girl,' she said; 'you are only too\r\nable to overcome my judgment. There, Mr. Pulvertoft, look happy again--I\r\nrelent. You may stay if you will!'\r\n\r\nYou must believe that I felt thoroughly ashamed of myself, for I could\r\nnot be blind to the encouragement which, though I sought to confine my\r\nwords to strict truth, I was innocently affording. But, with a horse\r\nlike mine, what was a man to do? What would you have done yourself? As\r\nsoon as was prudent, I hinted to Brutus that his confidences had lasted\r\nlong enough; and as he trotted away with me, he remarked, 'I thought you\r\nwere never going.' Was he weary of the grey already? My heart leaped.\r\n'Brutus,' I said thickly, 'are you strong enough to bear a great joy?'\r\n\r\n'Speak out,' he said, 'and do try to keep those heels out of my ribs.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot see you suffer,' I told him, with a sense of my own hypocrisy\r\nall the time. 'I must tell you--circumstances have come to my knowledge\r\nwhich lead me to believe that we have both judged Wild Rose too hastily.\r\nI am sure that her heart is yours still. She is only longing to tell you\r\nthat she has never really swerved from her allegiance.'\r\n\r\n'It is too late now,' he said, and the back of his head looked\r\ninflexibly obstinate; 'we have kept asunder too long.'\r\n\r\n'No,' I said, 'listen. I take more interest in you than you are,\r\nperhaps, aware of, and I have thought of a little plan for bringing you\r\ntogether again. What if I find an opportunity to see the lady she\r\nbelongs to--we have not met lately, as you know, and I do not pretend\r\nthat I desire a renewal of our intimacy----'\r\n\r\n'You like the one on the grey best; I saw that long ago,' he said; and I\r\nleft him in his error.\r\n\r\n'In any case, for your sake, I will sacrifice myself,' I said\r\nmagnanimously. 'I will begin to-morrow. Come, you will not let your\r\nlives be wrecked by a foolish lovers' quarrel?'\r\n\r\nHe made a little half-hearted opposition, but finally, as I knew he\r\nwould, consented. I had gained my point: I was free from Miss Gittens at\r\nlast!\r\n\r\nThat evening I met Diana in the hall of a house in Eaton Square. She was\r\ngoing downstairs as I was making my way to the ball-room, and greeted me\r\nwith a rather cool little nod.\r\n\r\n'You have quite deserted me lately,' she said, smiling, but I could read\r\nthe reproach in her eyes, 'you never ride with us now.'\r\n\r\nMy throat was swelling with passionate eloquence--and I could not get\r\nany of it out.\r\n\r\n'No, I never do,' was all my stupid tongue could find to say.\r\n\r\n'You have discovered a more congenial companion,' said cruel Diana.\r\n\r\n'Miss Chetwynd,' I said eagerly, 'you don't know how I have been\r\nwishing--! Will you let me ride with you to-morrow, as--as you used to\r\ndo?'\r\n\r\n'You are quite sure you won't be afraid of my naughty Wild Rose?' she\r\nsaid. 'I have given her such a scolding, that I think she is thoroughly\r\nashamed of herself.'\r\n\r\n'You thought it was _that_ that kept me!' I cried. 'Oh, if I could tell\r\nyou!'\r\n\r\nShe smiled: she was my dear, friendly Diana again.\r\n\r\n'You shall tell me all about it to-morrow,' she said. 'You will not\r\nhave another opportunity, because we are going to Aix on Friday. And\r\nnow, good-night. I am stopping the way, and the linkman is getting quite\r\nexcited over it.'\r\n\r\nShe passed on, and the carriage rolled away with her, and I was too\r\nhappy to mind very much--had she not forgiven me? Should we not meet\r\nto-morrow? I should have two whole hours to declare myself in, and this\r\ntime I would dally with Fortune no longer.\r\n\r\nHow excited I was the following day: how fearful, when the morning broke\r\ngrey and lowering: how grateful, when the benignant sun shone out later,\r\nand promised a brilliant afternoon: how carefully I dressed, and what a\r\nprice I paid for the flower for my buttonhole!\r\n\r\nSo we cantered on to the Row, as goodly a couple (if I may be pardoned\r\nthis retrospective vanity) as any there; and by and by, I saw, with the\r\nquick eye of a lover, Diana's willowy form in the distance. She was not\r\nalone, but I knew that the Colonel would soon have to yield his place to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw me, she urged her mare to a trot, and came towards me\r\nwith the loveliest faint blush and dawning smile of welcome, when, all\r\nat once, Brutus came to a dead stop, which nearly threw me on his neck,\r\nand stood quivering in every limb.\r\n\r\n'Do you see that?' he said hoarsely. 'And I was about to forgive her!'\r\n\r\nI saw: my insinuation, baseless enough at the beginning, was now but too\r\nwell justified. Colonel Cockshott was on his raw-boned brown hunter, and\r\neven my brief acquaintance with horses enabled me to see that Wild Rose\r\nno longer regarded him with her former indifference.\r\n\r\nDiana and the Colonel had reined up and seemed waiting for me--would\r\nBrutus never move? 'Show your pride,' I said in an agonised whisper,\r\n'Treat her with the contempt she deserves!'\r\n\r\n'I will,' he said between his bit and clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nAnd then Miss Gittens came bumping by on the grey, and, before I could\r\ninterfere, my Houyhnhnm was off like a shot in pursuit. I saw Diana's\r\nsweet, surprised face: I heard the Colonel's jarring laugh as I passed,\r\nand I--I could only bow in mortified appeal, and long for a gulf to leap\r\ninto like Curtius!\r\n\r\nI don't know what I said to Miss Gittens. I believe I made myself\r\nrecklessly amiable, and I remember she lingered over parting in a\r\nhorribly emotional manner. I was too miserable to mind: all the time I\r\nwas seeing Diana's astonished eyes, hearing Colonel Cockshott's\r\nheartless laugh. Brutus made a kind of explanation on our way home: 'You\r\nmeant well,' he said, 'but you see you were wrong. Your proposed\r\nsacrifice, for which I am just as grateful to you as if it had been\r\neffected, was useless. All I could do in return was to take you where\r\nyour true inclination lay. I, too, can be unselfish.'\r\n\r\nI was too dejected to curse his unselfishness. I did not even trouble\r\nmyself to explain what it had probably cost me. I only felt drearily\r\nthat I had had my last ride, I had had enough of horsemanship for ever!\r\n\r\nThat evening I went to the theatre, I wanted to deaden thought for the\r\nmoment; and during one of the intervals I saw Lady Verney in the stalls,\r\nand went up to speak to her. 'Your niece is not with you?' I said; 'I\r\nthought I should have had a chance of--of saying good-bye to her before\r\nshe left for the continent.'\r\n\r\nI had a lingering hope that she might ask me to lunch, that I might have\r\none more opportunity of explaining.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Lady Verney, 'but that is all changed; we are not going--at\r\nleast, not yet.'\r\n\r\n'Not going!' I cried, incredulous for very joy.\r\n\r\n'No, it is all very sudden; but,--well, you are almost like an old\r\nfriend, and you are sure to hear it sooner or later. I only knew myself\r\nthis afternoon, when she came in from her ride. Colonel Cockshott has\r\nproposed and she has accepted him. We're _so_ pleased about it. Wasn't\r\ndear Mrs. ---- delightful in that last act? I positively saw real tears\r\non her face!'\r\n\r\nIf I had waited much longer she would have seen a similar display of\r\nrealism on mine. But I went back and sat the interval out, and listened\r\ncritically to the classical selection of chamber-music from the\r\norchestra, and saw the rest of the play, though I have no notion how it\r\nended.\r\n\r\nAll that night my heart was slowly consumed by a dull rage that grew\r\nwith every sleepless hour; but the object of my resentment was not\r\nDiana. She had only done what as a woman she was amply justified in\r\ndoing after the pointed slight I had apparently inflicted upon her. Her\r\npunishment was sufficient already, for, of course, I guessed that she\r\nhad only accepted the Colonel under the first intolerable sting of\r\ndesertion. No: I reserved all my wrath for Brutus, who had betrayed me\r\nat the moment of triumph. I planned revenge. Cost what it might I would\r\nride him once more. In the eyes of the law I was his master. I would\r\nexercise my legal rights to the full.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon came at last. I was in a white heat of anger, though as I\r\nascended to the saddle there were bystanders who put a more uncharitable\r\nconstruction upon my complexion.\r\n\r\nBrutus cast an uneasy eye at my heels as we started: 'What are those\r\nthings you've got on?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n'Spurs,' I replied curtly.\r\n\r\n'You shouldn't wear them till you have learnt to turn your toes in,' he\r\nsaid. 'And a whip, too! May I ask what that is for?'\r\n\r\n'We will discuss that presently,' I said very coldly; for I did not want\r\nto have a scene with my horse in the street.\r\n\r\nWhen we came round by the statue of Achilles and on to the Ride, I\r\nshortened my reins, and got a better hold of the whip, while I found\r\nthat, from some cause I cannot explain, the roof of my mouth grew\r\nuncomfortably dry.\r\n\r\n'I should be glad of a little quiet talk with you, if you've no\r\nobjection,' I began.\r\n\r\n'I am quite at your disposal,' he said, champing his bit with a touch of\r\nirony.\r\n\r\n'First, let me tell you,' I said, 'that I have lost my only love for\r\never.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' he retorted flippantly, 'you won't die of it. So have I. We must\r\nendeavour to console one another!'\r\n\r\nI still maintained a deadly calm. 'You seem unaware that you are the\r\nsole cause of my calamity,' I said. 'Had you only consented to face Wild\r\nRose yesterday, I should have been a happy man by this time!'\r\n\r\n'How was I to know that, when you let me think all your affections were\r\ngiven to the elderly thing who is trotted out by my friend the grey?'\r\n\r\n'We won't argue, please,' I said hastily. 'It is enough that your\r\ninfernal egotism and self-will have ruined my happiness. I have allowed\r\nyou to usurp the rule, to reverse our natural positions. I shall do so\r\nno more. I intend to teach you a lesson you will never forget.'\r\n\r\nFor a horse, he certainly had a keen sense of humour. I thought the\r\ngirths would have snapped.\r\n\r\n'And when do you intend to begin?' he asked, as soon as he could speak.\r\n\r\nI looked in front of me: there were Diana and her accepted lover riding\r\ntowards us; and so natural is dissimulation, even to the sweetest and\r\nbest women, that no one would have suspected from her radiant face that\r\nher gaiety covered an aching heart.\r\n\r\n'I intend to begin _now_,' I said. 'Monster, demon, whatever you are\r\nthat have held me in thrall so long, I have broken my chains! I have\r\nbeen a coward long enough. You may kill me if you like. I rather hope\r\nyou will; but first I mean to pay you back some of the humiliation with\r\nwhich you have loaded me. I intend to thrash you as long as I remain in\r\nthe saddle.'\r\n\r\nI have been told by eye-witnesses that the chastisement was of brief\r\nduration, but while it lasted, I flatter myself, it was severe. I laid\r\ninto him with a stout whip, of whose effectiveness I had assured myself\r\nby experiments upon my own legs. I dug my borrowed spurs into his\r\nflanks. I jerked his mouth. I dare say he was almost as much surprised\r\nas pained. But he _was_ pained!\r\n\r\nI was about to continue my practical rebuke, when my victim suddenly\r\nevaded my grasp; and for one vivid second I seemed to be gazing upon a\r\nbirdseye view of his back; and then there was a crash, and I lay,\r\nbuzzing like a bee, in an iridescent fog, and each colour meant a\r\ndifferent pain, and they faded at last into darkness, and I remember no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n'It was weeks,' concluded Mr. Pulvertoft, 'before that darkness lifted\r\nand revealed me to myself as a strapped and bandaged invalid. But--and\r\nthis is perhaps the most curious part of my narrative--almost the first\r\nsounds that reached my ears were those of wedding bells; and I knew,\r\nwithout requiring to be told, that they were ringing for Diana's\r\nmarriage with the Colonel. _That_ showed there wasn't much the matter\r\nwith me, didn't it? Why, I can hear them everywhere now. I don't think\r\nshe ought to have had them rung at Sandown though: it was just a little\r\nostentatious, so long after the ceremony; don't you think so?'\r\n\r\n'Yes--yes,' I said; 'but you never told me what became of the horse.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! the horse--yes. I am looking for him. I'm not so angry with him as\r\nI was, and I don't like to ask too many questions at the stables, for\r\nfear they may tell me one day that they had to shoot him while I was so\r\nill. You knew I was ill, I dare say?' he broke off: 'there were\r\nbulletins about me in the papers. Look here.'\r\n\r\nHe handed me a cutting on which I read:\r\n\r\n'THE RECENT ACCIDENT IN ROTTEN ROW.--There is no change as yet in Mr.\r\nPulvertoft's condition. The unfortunate gentleman is still lying\r\nunconscious at his rooms in Park Street; and his medical attendants fear\r\nthat, even if he recovers his physical strength, the brain will be\r\npermanently injured.'\r\n\r\n'But that was all nonsense!' said Mr. Pulvertoft, with a little nervous\r\nlaugh, 'it wasn't injured a bit, or how could I remember everything so\r\nclearly as I do, you know?'\r\n\r\nAnd this was an argument that was, of course, unanswerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE GOOD LITTLE GIRL_\r\n\r\nA STORY FOR CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nHer name was Priscilla Prodgers, and she was a very good little girl\r\nindeed. So good was she, in fact, that she could not help being aware of\r\nit herself, and that is a stage to which very many quite excellent\r\npersons never succeed in attaining. She was only just a child, it is\r\ntrue, but she had read a great many beautiful story-books, and so she\r\nknew what a powerful reforming influence a childish and innocent remark,\r\nor a youthful example, or a happy combination of both, can exert over\r\ngrown-up people. And early in life--she was but eleven at the date of\r\nthis history--early in life she had seen clearly that her mission was to\r\nreform her family and relatives generally. This was a heavy task for one\r\nso young, particularly in Priscilla's case, for, besides a father,\r\nmother, brother, and sister, in whom she could not but discern many and\r\nserious failings, she possessed an aunt who was addicted to insincerity,\r\ntwo female cousins whose selfishness and unamiability were painful to\r\nwitness, and a male cousin who talked slang and was so worldly that he\r\nhabitually went about in yellow boots! Nevertheless Priscilla did not\r\nflinch, although, for some reason, her earnest and unremitting efforts\r\nhad hitherto failed to produce any deep impression. At times she thought\r\nthis was owing to the fact that she tried to reform all her family\r\ntogether, and that her best plan would be to take each one separately,\r\nand devote her whole energies to improving that person alone. But then\r\nshe never could make up her mind which member of the family to begin\r\nwith. It is small wonder that she often felt a little disheartened, but\r\neven that was a cheering symptom, for in the books it is generally just\r\nwhen the little heroine becomes most discouraged that the seemingly\r\nimpenitent relative exhibits the first sign of softening.\r\n\r\nSo Priscilla persevered: sometimes with merely a shocked glance of\r\ndisapproval, which she had practised before the looking-glass until she\r\ncould do it perfectly; sometimes with some tender, tactful little hint.\r\n'Don't you think, dear papa,' she would say softly, on a Sunday morning,\r\n'don't you _think_ you could write your newspaper article on some\r\n_other_ day--is it a work of _real_ necessity?' Or she would ask her\r\nmother, who was certainly fond of wearing pretty things. 'How much bread\r\nfor poor starving people would the price of your new bonnet buy, mother?\r\nI should so like to work it out on my little slate!'\r\n\r\nThen she would remind her brother Alick that it would be so much better\r\nif, instead of wasting his time in playing with silly little tin\r\nsoldiers, he would try to learn as much as he could before he was sent\r\nto school; while she was never tired of quoting to her sister Betty the\r\nline, 'Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever!' which Betty,\r\nquite unjustly, interpreted to mean that Priscilla thought but poorly of\r\nher sister's intellectual capacity. Once when, as a great treat, the\r\nchildren were allowed to read 'Ivanhoe' aloud, Priscilla declined to\r\nparticipate until she had conscientiously read up the whole Norman\r\nperiod in her English history; and on another occasion she cried\r\nbitterly on hearing that her mother had arranged for them to learn\r\ndancing, and even endured bread and water for an entire day rather than\r\nconsent to acquire an accomplishment which she feared, from what she had\r\nread, would prove a snare. On the second day--well, there was roast beef\r\nand Yorkshire pudding for dinner, and Priscilla yielded; but she made\r\nthe resolution--and kept it too--that, if she went to the dancing class,\r\nshe would firmly refuse to take the slightest pains to learn a single\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nI only mention all these traits to show that Priscilla really was an\r\nunusually good child, which makes it the more sad and strange that her\r\nfamily should have profited so little by her example. She was neither\r\nloved nor respected as she ought to have been, I am grieved to say. Her\r\npapa, when he was not angry, made the cruellest fun of her mild\r\nreproofs; her mother continued to spend money on dresses and bonnets,\r\nand even allowed the maid to say that her mistress was 'not at home,'\r\nwhen she was merely unwilling to receive visitors. Alick and Betty, too,\r\nonly grew more exasperated when Priscilla urged them to keep their\r\ntempers, and altogether she could not help feeling how wasted and thrown\r\naway she was in such a circle.\r\n\r\nBut she never quite lost heart; her papa was a literary man and wrote\r\ntales, some of which she feared were not as true as they affected to be,\r\nwhile he invariably neglected to insert a moral in any of them;\r\nfrequently she dropped little remarks before him with apparent\r\ncarelessness, in the hope that he might put them in print--but he never\r\ndid; she never could recognise herself as a character in any of his\r\nstories, and so at last she gave up reading them at all!\r\n\r\nBut one morning she came more near to giving up in utter despair than\r\never before. Only the previous day she had been so hopeful! her father\r\nhad really seemed to be beginning to appreciate his little daughter, and\r\nhad presented her with sixpence in the new coinage to put in her\r\nmoney-box. This had emboldened her to such a degree that, happening on\r\nthe following morning to hear him ejaculate 'Confound it!' she had,\r\npressing one hand to her beating heart and laying the other hand softly\r\nupon his shoulder (which is the proper attitude on these occasions),\r\nreminded him that such an expression was scarcely less reprehensible\r\nthan actual bad language. Upon which her hard-hearted papa had told her,\r\nalmost sharply, '_not to be a little prig!_'\r\n\r\nPriscilla forgave him, of course, and freely, because he was her father\r\nand it was her duty to bear with him; but she felt the injustice deeply,\r\nfor all that. Then, when she went up into the nursery, Alick and Betty\r\nmade a frantic uproar, merely because she insisted on teaching them the\r\nmoves in chess, when they perversely wanted to play Halma! So, feeling\r\nbaffled and sick at heart, she had put on her hat and run out all alone\r\nto a quiet lane near her home, where she could soothe her troubled mind\r\nby thinking over the ingratitude and lack of appreciation with which her\r\nefforts were met.\r\n\r\nShe had not gone very far up the lane when she saw, seated on a bench, a\r\nbent old woman in a poke-bonnet with a crutch-handled stick in her\r\nhands, and this old woman Priscilla (who was very quick of observation)\r\ninstantly guessed to be a fairy--in which, as it fell out, she was\r\nperfectly right.\r\n\r\n'Good day, my pretty child!' croaked the old dame.\r\n\r\n'Good-day to you, ma'am!' answered Priscilla politely (for she knew that\r\nit was not only right but prudent to be civil to fairies, particularly\r\nwhen they take the form of old women). 'But, if you please, you mustn't\r\ncall me pretty--because I am not. At least,' she added, for she prided\r\nherself upon her truthfulness, 'not _exactly_ pretty. And I should hate\r\nto be always thinking about my looks, like poor Milly--she's our\r\nhousemaid, you know--and I so often have to tell her that she did not\r\nmake her _own_ face.'\r\n\r\n'I don't alarm you, I see,' said the old crone; 'but possibly you're not\r\naware that you're talking to a fairy?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, I am--but I'm not a bit afraid, because, you see, fairies can\r\nonly hurt _bad_ children.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, and you're a good little child--that's not difficult to see!'\r\n\r\n'They don't see it at home!' said Priscilla, with a sad little sigh, 'or\r\nthey would listen more when I tell them of things they oughtn't to do.'\r\n\r\n'And what things do they do that they oughtn't to, my child--if you\r\ndon't mind telling me?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't mind in the _least_!' Priscilla hastened to assure her; and\r\nthen she told the old woman all her family's faults, and the trial it\r\nwas to bear with them and go on trying to induce them to mend their\r\nways. 'And papa is getting worse than ever,' she concluded dolefully;\r\n'only fancy, this very morning he called me a little prig!'\r\n\r\n'Tut, tut!' said the fairy sympathetically, 'deary, deary me! So he\r\ncalled you _that_, did he?--\"a little prig\"! And _you_, too! Ah, the\r\nworld's coming to a pretty pass! I suppose, now, your papa and the rest\r\nof them have got it into their heads that you are too young and too\r\ninexperienced to set up as their adviser--is that it?'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid so,' admitted Priscilla; 'but we mustn't blame them,' she\r\nadded gently, 'we must remember that they don't know any better--mustn't\r\nwe, ma'am?'\r\n\r\n'You sweet child!' said the old lady with enthusiasm; 'I must see if I\r\ncan't do something to help you, though I'm not the fairy I used to\r\nbe--still, there are tricks I can manage still, if I'm put to it. What\r\nyou want is something that will prove to them that they ought to pay\r\nmore attention to you, eh?--something there can be no possible mistake\r\nabout?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!' cried Priscilla eagerly, 'and--and--how would it be if you\r\nchanged them into something else, just to _show_ them, and then I could\r\nask for them to be transformed back again, you know?'\r\n\r\n'What an ingenious little thing you are!' exclaimed the fairy; 'but, let\r\nus see--if you came home and found your cruel papa doing duty as the\r\nfamily hatstand, or strutting about as a Cochin China fowl----'\r\n\r\n'Oh, _yes_; and I'd feed him every day, till he was sorry!' interrupted\r\nthe warmhearted little girl impulsively.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but you're so hasty, my dear. Who would write all the clever\r\narticles and tales to earn bread and meat for you all?--fowls can't use\r\na pen. No, we must find a prettier trick than that--there _was_ one I\r\nseem to remember, long, long ago, performing for a good little ill-used\r\ngirl, just like you, my dearie, just like you! Now what was it? some\r\ngift I gave her whenever she opened her lips----'\r\n\r\n'Why, _I_ remember--how funny that you should have forgotten! Whenever\r\nshe opened her lips, roses, and diamonds, and rubies fell out. That\r\nwould be the very thing! Then they'd _have_ to attend to me! Oh, do be a\r\nkind old fairy and give me a gift like that--do, _do_!'\r\n\r\n'Now, don't be so impetuous! You forget that this is not the time of\r\nyear for roses, and, as for jewels, well, I don't think I can be very\r\nfar wrong in supposing that you open your lips pretty frequently in the\r\ncourse of the day?'\r\n\r\n'Alick does call me a \"mag,\"' said Priscilla; 'but that's wrong, because\r\nI never speak without having something to say. I don't think people\r\nought to--it may do so _much_ harm; mayn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Undoubtedly. But, anyhow, if we made it _every_ time you opened your\r\nlips, you would soon ruin me in precious stones, that's plain! No, I\r\nthink we had better say that the jewels shall only drop when you are\r\nsaying something you wish to be particularly improving--how will that\r\ndo?'\r\n\r\n'Very nicely indeed, ma'am, thank you,' said Priscilla, 'because, you\r\nsee, it comes to just the same thing.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, well, try to be as economical of your good things as you\r\ncan--remember that in these hard times a poor old fairy's riches are\r\nnot as inexhaustible as they used to be.'\r\n\r\n'And jewels really will drop out?'\r\n\r\n'Whenever they are wanted to \"point a moral and adorn a tale,\"' said the\r\nold woman (who, for a fairy, was particularly well-read). 'There, run\r\nalong home, do, and scatter your pearls before your relations.'\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be said that Priscilla was only too willing to obey;\r\nshe ran all the way home with a light heart, eager to exhibit her\r\nwonderful gift. 'How surprised they will be!' she was thinking. 'If it\r\nhad been Betty, instead of me, I suppose she would have come back\r\ntalking toads! It would have been a good lesson for her--but still,\r\ntoads are nasty things, and it would have been rather unpleasant for the\r\nrest of us. I think I won't tell Betty _where_ I met the fairy.'\r\n\r\nShe came in and took her place demurely at the family luncheon, which\r\nwas the children's dinner; they were all seated already, including her\r\nfather, who had got through most of his writing in the course of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n'Now make haste and eat your dinner, Priscilla,' said her mother, 'or it\r\nwill be quite cold.'\r\n\r\n'I always let it get a little cold, mother,' replied the good little\r\ngirl, 'so that I mayn't come to think too much about eating, you know.'\r\n\r\nAs she uttered this remark, she felt a jewel producing itself in some\r\nmysterious way from the tip of her tongue, and saw it fall with a\r\nclatter into her plate. 'I'll pretend not to notice anything,' she\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' exclaimed Alick, pausing in the act of mastication, 'I\r\nsay--_Prissie_!'\r\n\r\n'If you ask mother, I'm sure she will tell you that it is most\r\nill-mannered to speak with your mouth full,' said Priscilla, her speech\r\ngreatly impeded by an immense emerald.\r\n\r\n'I like that!' exclaimed her rude brother; 'who's speaking with their\r\nmouth full _now_?'\r\n\r\n'\"_Their_\" is not grammar, dear,' was Priscilla's only reply to this\r\ntaunt, as she delicately ejected a pearl, 'you should say _her_ mouth\r\nfull.' For Priscilla's grammar was as good as her principles.\r\n\r\n'But really, Priscilla, dear,' said her mother, who felt some\r\nembarrassment at so novel an experience as being obliged to find fault\r\nwith her little daughter, 'you should not eat sweets just before dinner,\r\nand--and couldn't you get rid of them in some other manner?'\r\n\r\n'Sweets!' cried Priscilla, considerably annoyed at being so\r\nmisunderstood, 'they are not _sweets,_ mother. Look!' And she offered to\r\nsubmit one for inspection.\r\n\r\n'If I may venture to express an opinion,' observed her father, 'I would\r\nrather that a child of mine should suck sweets than coloured beads, and\r\nin either case I object to having them prominently forced upon my\r\nnotice at meal-times. But I daresay I'm wrong. I generally am.'\r\n\r\n'Papa is quite right, dear,' said her mother, 'it _is_ such a dangerous\r\nhabit--suppose you were to swallow one, you know! Put them in the fire,\r\nlike a good girl, and go on with your dinner.'\r\n\r\nPriscilla rose without a word, her cheeks crimsoning, and dropped the\r\npearl, ruby, and emerald, with great accuracy, into the very centre of\r\nthe fire. This done, she returned to her seat, and went on with her\r\ndinner in silence, though her feelings prevented her from eating very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n'If they choose to think my pearls are only beads, or jujubes, or\r\nacidulated drops,' she said to herself, bitterly, 'I won't waste any\r\nmore on them, that's all! I won't open my lips again, except to say\r\nquite ordinary things--so _there_!'\r\n\r\nIf Priscilla had not been such a very good little girl, you might almost\r\nhave thought she was in a temper; but she was not; her feelings were\r\nwounded, that was all, which is quite a different thing.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, her aunt Margarine, Mrs. Hoyle, came to call. She was\r\nthe aunt whom we have already mentioned as being given to insincerity;\r\nshe was not well off, and had a tendency to flatter people; but\r\nPriscilla was fond of her notwithstanding, and she had never detected\r\nher in any insincerity towards herself. She was sent into the\r\ndrawing-room to entertain her aunt until her mother was ready to come\r\ndown, and her aunt, as usual, overwhelmed her with affectionate\r\nadmiration. 'How pretty and well you are looking, my pet!' she began,\r\n'and oh, what a beautiful frock you have on!'\r\n\r\n'The little silkworms wore it before I did, aunt,' said Priscilla,\r\nmodestly.\r\n\r\n'How sweet of you to say so! But they never looked half so well in it,\r\nI'll be bou---- Why, my child, you've dropped a stone out of a brooch or\r\nsomething. Look--on the carpet there!'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Priscilla, carelessly, 'it was out of my mouth--not out of a\r\nbrooch, I never wear jewellery. I think jewellery makes people grow so\r\nconceited; don't you, Aunt Margarine?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, indeed, dearest--indeed you are _so_ right!' said her aunt (who\r\nwore a cameo-brooch as large as a tart upon her cloak), 'and--and surely\r\nthat can't be a _diamond_ in your lap?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, it is. I met a fairy this morning in the lane, and so----' and\r\nhere Priscilla proceeded to narrate her wonderful experience. 'I thought\r\nit might perhaps make papa and mamma value me a little more than they\r\ndo,' she said wistfully, as she finished her story, 'but they don't take\r\nthe least notice; they made me put the jewels on the fire--they did,\r\nreally!'\r\n\r\n'What blindness!' cried her aunt; 'how _can_ people shut their eyes to\r\nsuch a treasure? And--and may I just have _one_ look? What, you really\r\ndon't want them?--I may keep them for my very own? You precious love!\r\nAh, I know a humble home where you would be appreciated at your proper\r\nworth. What would I not give for my poor naughty Belle and Cathie to\r\nhave the advantage of seeing more of such a cousin!'\r\n\r\n'I don't know whether I could do them much good,' said Priscilla, 'but I\r\nwould try my best.'\r\n\r\n'I am sure you would!' said Aunt Margarine, 'and now, dearest sweet, I\r\nam going to ask your dear mamma to spare you to us for just a little\r\nwhile; we must both beg very hard.'\r\n\r\n'I'll go and tell nurse to pack my things now, and then I can go away\r\nwith you,' said the little girl.\r\n\r\nWhen her mother heard of the invitation, she consented quite willingly.\r\n'To tell you the truth, Margarine,' she said, 'I shall be very glad for\r\nthe child to have a change. She seems a little unhappy at home with us,\r\nand she behaved most unlike her usual self at lunch; it _can't_ be\r\nnatural for a child of her age to chew large glass beads. Did your\r\nCathie and Belle ever do such a thing?'\r\n\r\n'Never,' said Aunt Margarine, coughing. 'It is a habit that certainly\r\nought to be checked, and I promise you, my dear Lucy, that if you will\r\nonly trust Priscilla to me, I will take away anything of that kind the\r\nvery moment I find it. And I do think, poor as we are, we shall manage\r\nto make her feel at home. We are all so fond of your sweet Priscilla!'\r\n\r\nSo the end of it was that Priscilla went to stay with her aunt that\r\nvery afternoon, and her family bore the parting with the greatest\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\n'I can't give you nice food, or a pretty bedroom to sleep in such as you\r\nhave at home,' said her kind aunt. 'We are very plain people, my pet;\r\nbut at least we can promise you a warm welcome.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, auntie,' protested Priscilla, 'you mustn't think I mind a little\r\nhardship! Why, if beds weren't hard and food not nicely cooked now and\r\nthen, we should soon grow too luxurious to do our duty, and that would\r\nbe so very bad for us!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, what _beauties_!' cried her aunt, involuntarily, as she stooped to\r\nrecover several sparkling gems from the floor of the cab. 'I mean--it's\r\nbetter to pick them up, dear, don't you think? they might get in\r\npeople's _way_, you know. What a blessing you will be in our simple\r\nhome! I want you to do all you can to instruct your cousins; don't be\r\nafraid of telling them of any faults you may happen to see. Poor Cathie\r\nand Belle, I fear they are very far from being all they should be!' and\r\nAunt Margarine heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n'Never mind, auntie; they will be better in time, I am sure. _I_ wasn't\r\n_always_ a good girl.'\r\n\r\nPriscilla thoroughly enjoyed the first few days of her visit; even her\r\naunt was only too grateful for instruction, and begged that Priscilla\r\nwould tell her, quite candidly, of any shortcomings she might notice.\r\nAnd Priscilla, very kindly and considerately, always _did_ tell her.\r\nBelle and Catherine were less docile, and she saw that it would take her\r\nsome time to win their esteem and affection; but this was just what\r\nPriscilla liked: it was the usual experience of the heroines in the\r\nbooks, and much more interesting, too, than conquering her cousins'\r\nhearts at once.\r\n\r\nStill, both Catherine and Belle persistently hardened their hearts\r\nagainst their gentle little cousin in the unkindest way; they would\r\nscarcely speak to her, and chose to make a grievance out of the fact\r\nthat one or other of them was obliged, by their mother's strict orders,\r\nto be constantly in attendance upon her, in order to pick up and bring\r\nMrs. Hoyle all the jewels that Priscilla scattered in profusion wherever\r\nshe went.\r\n\r\n'If you would only carry a plate about with you, Priscilla,' complained\r\nBelle one day, 'you could catch the jewels in that.'\r\n\r\n'But I don't _want_ to catch the jewels, dear Belle,' said Priscilla,\r\nwith a playful but very sweet smile; 'if other people prize such things,\r\nthat is not my fault, is it? _Jewels_ do not make people any happier,\r\nBelle!'\r\n\r\n'I should think not!' exclaimed Belle. 'I'm sure my back perfectly aches\r\nwith stooping, and so does Cathie's. There! that big topaz has just gone\r\nand rolled under the sideboard, and mother will be so angry if I don't\r\nget it out! It is too bad of you, Priscilla! _I_ believe you do it on\r\npurpose!'\r\n\r\n'Ah, you will know me better some day, dear, was the gentle response.\r\n\r\n'Well, at all events, I think you might be naughty just now and then,\r\nPrissie, and give Cathie and me a half-holiday.'\r\n\r\n'I would do anything else to please you, dear, but not that; you must\r\nnot ask me to do what is impossible.'\r\n\r\nAlas! not even this angelic behaviour, not even the loving admonitions,\r\nthe tender rebukes, the shocked reproaches that fell, accompanied by\r\nperfect cascades of jewels, from the lips of our pattern little\r\nPriscilla, succeeded in removing the utterly unfounded prejudices of her\r\ncousins, though it was some consolation to feel that she was gradually\r\nacquiring a most beneficial influence over her aunt, who called\r\nPriscilla 'her little conscience.' For, you see, Priscilla's conscience\r\nhad so little to do on her own account that it was always at the service\r\nof other people, and indeed quite enjoyed being useful, as was only\r\nnatural to a conscientious conscience which felt that it could never\r\nhave been created to be idle.\r\n\r\nVery soon another responsibility was added to little Priscilla's\r\nburdens. Her cousin Dick, the worldly one with the yellow boots, came\r\nhome after his annual holiday, which, as he was the junior clerk in a\r\nlarge bank, he was obliged to take rather late in the year. She had\r\nlooked forward to his return with some excitement. Dick, she knew, was\r\nfrivolous and reckless in his habits--he went to the theatre\r\noccasionally and frequently spent an evening in playing billiards and\r\nsmoking cigars at a friend's house. There would be real credit in\r\nreforming poor cousin Dick.\r\n\r\nHe was not long, of course, in hearing of Priscilla's marvellous\r\nendowment, and upon the first occasion they were alone together treated\r\nher with a respect and admiration which he had very certainly never\r\nshown her before.\r\n\r\n'You're wonderful, Prissie!' he said; 'I'd no idea you had it in you!'\r\n\r\n'Nor had I, Dick; but it shows that even a little girl can do\r\nsomething.'\r\n\r\n'I should rather think so! and--and the way you look--as grave as a\r\njudge all the time! Prissie, I wish you'd tell me how you manage it, I\r\nwouldn't tell a soul.'\r\n\r\n'But I don't know, Dick. I only talk and the jewels come--that is all.'\r\n\r\n'You artful little girl! you can keep a secret, I see, but so can I. And\r\nyou might tell me how you do the trick. What put you up to the dodge?\r\nI'm to be trusted, I assure you.'\r\n\r\n'Dick, you can't--you mustn't--think there is any trickery about it! How\r\ncan you believe I could be such a wicked little girl as to play tricks?\r\nIt was an old fairy that gave me the gift. I'm sure I don't know\r\nwhy--unless she thought that I was a good child and deserved to be\r\nencouraged.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' cried Dick, 'I never knew you were half such fun!'\r\n\r\n'I am not fun, Dick. I think fun is generally so very vulgar, and oh, I\r\nwish you wouldn't say \"by Jove!\" Surely you know he was a heathen god!'\r\n\r\n'I seem to have heard of him in some such capacity,' said Dick. 'I say,\r\nPrissie, what a ripping big ruby!'\r\n\r\n'Ah, Dick, Dick, you are like the others! I'm afraid you think more of\r\nthe jewels than of any words I may say--and yet _jewels_ are common\r\nenough!'\r\n\r\n'They seem to be with you. Pearls, too, and such fine ones! Here,\r\nPriscilla, take them; they're your property.'\r\n\r\nPriscilla put her hands behind her: 'No, indeed, Dick, they are of no\r\nuse to me. Keep them, please; they may help to remind you of what I have\r\nsaid.'\r\n\r\n'It's awfully kind of you,' said Dick, looking really touched.\r\n'Then--since you put it in that way--thanks, I will, Priscilla. I'll\r\nhave them made into a horse-shoe pin.'\r\n\r\n'You mustn't let it make you too fond of dress, then,' said Priscilla;\r\n'but I'm afraid you're that already, Dick.'\r\n\r\n'A diamond!' he cried; 'go on, Priscilla, I'm listening--pitch into me,\r\nit will do me a _lot_ of good!'\r\n\r\nBut Priscilla thought it wisest to say no more just then.\r\n\r\nThat night, after Priscilla and Cathie and Belle had gone to bed, Dick\r\nand his mother sat up talking until a late hour.\r\n\r\n'Is dear little cousin Priscilla to be a permanency in this\r\nestablishment?' began her cousin, stifling a yawn, for there had been a\r\nrather copious flow of precious stones during the evening.\r\n\r\n'Well, I shall keep her with us as long as I can,' said Mrs. Hoyle,\r\n'she's such a darling, and they don't seem to want her at home. I'm\r\nsure, limited as my means are, I'm most happy to have such a visitor.'\r\n\r\n'She seems to pay her way--only her way is a trifle trying at times,\r\nisn't it? She lectured me for half an hour on end without a single\r\ncheck!'\r\n\r\n'Are you sure you picked them all up, dear boy?'\r\n\r\n'Got a few of the best in my waistcoat-pocket now. I'm afraid I\r\nscrunched a pearl or two, though: they were all over the place, you\r\nknow. I suppose you've been collecting too, mater?'\r\n\r\n'I picked up one or two,' said his mother; 'I should think I must have\r\nnearly enough now to fill a bandbox. And that brings me to what I wanted\r\nto consult you about, Richard. How are we to dispose of them? She has\r\ngiven them all to me.'\r\n\r\n'You haven't done anything with them yet, then?'\r\n\r\n'How could I? I have been obliged to stay at home: I've been so afraid\r\nof letting that precious child go out of my sight for a single hour,\r\nfor fear some unscrupulous persons might get hold of her. I thought that\r\nperhaps, when you came home, you would dispose of the jewels for me.'\r\n\r\n'But, mater,' protested Dick, 'I can't go about asking who'll buy a\r\nwhole bandbox full of jewels!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, very well, then; I suppose we must go on living this hugger-mugger\r\nlife when we have the means of being as rich as princes, just because\r\nyou are too lazy and selfish to take a little trouble!'\r\n\r\n'I know something about these things,' said Dick. 'I know a fellow who's\r\na diamond merchant, and it's not so easy to sell a lot of valuable\r\nstones as you seem to imagine, mother. And then Priscilla really\r\noverdoes it, you know--why, if she goes on like this, she'll make\r\ndiamonds as cheap as currants!'\r\n\r\n'_I_ should have thought that was a reason for selling them as soon as\r\npossible; but I'm only a woman, and of course _my_ opinion is worth\r\nnothing! Still, you might take some of the biggest to your friend, and\r\naccept whatever he'll give you for them--there are plenty more, you\r\nneedn't haggle over the price.'\r\n\r\n'He'd want to know all about them, and what should I say? I can't tell\r\nhim a cousin of mine produces them whenever she feels disposed.'\r\n\r\n'You could say they have been in the family for some time, and you are\r\nobliged to part with them; I don't ask you to tell a falsehood,\r\nRichard.'\r\n\r\n'Well, to tell you the honest truth,' said Dick, 'I'd rather have\r\nnothing to do with it. I'm not proud, but I shouldn't like it to get\r\nabout among our fellows at the bank that I went about hawking diamonds.'\r\n\r\n'But, you stupid, undutiful boy, don't you see that you could leave the\r\nbank--you need never do anything any more--we should all live rich and\r\nhappy somewhere in the country, if we could only sell those jewels! And\r\nyou won't do that one little thing!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Dick, 'I'll think over it. I'll see what I can do.'\r\n\r\nAnd his mother knew that it was perfectly useless to urge him any\r\nfurther: for, in some things, Dick was as obstinate as a mule, and, in\r\nothers, far too easy-going and careless ever to succeed in life. He had\r\npromised to think over it, however, and she had to be contented with\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nOn the evening following this conversation cousin Dick entered the\r\nsitting-room the moment after his return from the City, and found his\r\nmother to all appearances alone.\r\n\r\n'What a dear sweet little guileless angel cousin Priscilla is, to be\r\nsure!' was his first remark.\r\n\r\n'Then you _have_ sold some of the stones!' cried Aunt Margarine. 'Sit\r\ndown, like a good boy, and tell me all about it.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Dick, 'I took the finest diamonds and rubies and pearls\r\nthat escaped from that saintlike child last night in the course of some\r\nextremely disparaging comments on my character and pursuits--I took\r\nthose jewels to Faycett and Rosewater's in New Bond Street--you know the\r\nshop, on the right-hand side as you go up----'\r\n\r\n'Oh, go on, Dick; go on--never mind _where_ it is--how much did you get\r\nfor them?'\r\n\r\n'I'm coming to that; keep cool, dear mamma. Well, I went in, and I saw\r\nthe manager, and I said: \"I want you to make these up into a horse-shoe\r\nscarf-pin for me.\"'\r\n\r\n'You said that! You never tried to sell one? Oh, Dick, you are too\r\nprovoking!'\r\n\r\n'Hold on, mater; I haven't done yet. So the manager--a very gentlemanly\r\nperson, rather thin on the top of the head--not that that affects his\r\nbusiness capacities; for, after all----'\r\n\r\n'Dick, do you want to drive me frantic!'\r\n\r\n'I can't conceive any domestic occurrence which would be more\r\ndistressing or generally inconvenient, mother dear. You do interrupt a\r\nfellow so! I forgot where I was now--oh, the manager, ah yes! Well, the\r\nmanager said, \"We shall be very happy to have the stones made in any\r\ndesign you may select\"--jewellery, by the way, seems to exercise a most\r\nrefining influence upon the manners: this man had the deportment of a\r\nduke--\"you may select,\" he said; \"but of course I need not tell you that\r\nnone of these stones are genuine.\"'\r\n\r\n'Not genuine!' cried Aunt Margarine excitedly. 'They must be--he was\r\nlying!'\r\n\r\n'West-end jewellers never lie,' said Dick; 'but naturally, when he said\r\nthat, I told him I should like to have some proof of his assertion.\r\n\"Will you take the risk of testing?\" said he. \"Test away, my dear man!\"\r\nsaid I. So he brought a little wheel near the emerald--\"whizz!\" and away\r\nwent the emerald! Then he let a drop of something fall on the ruby--and\r\nit fizzled up for all the world like pink champagne. \"Go on, don't mind\r\n_me_!\" I told him, so he touched the diamond with an electric\r\nwire--\"phit!\" and there was only something that looked like the ash of a\r\nshocking bad cigar. Then the pearls--and they popped like so many\r\nair-balloons. \"Are you satisfied?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n'\"Oh, perfectly,\"' said I, \"you needn't trouble about the horse-shoe pin\r\nnow. Good evening,\" and so I came away, after thanking him for his very\r\namusing scientific experiments.'\r\n\r\n'And do you believe that the jewels are all shams, Dick?--do you\r\nreally?'\r\n\r\n'I think it so probable that nothing on earth will induce me to offer a\r\nsingle one for sale. I should never hear the last of it at the bank. No,\r\nmater, dear little Priscilla's sparkling conversation may be unspeakably\r\nprecious from a moral point of view, but it has no commercial value.\r\nThose jewels are bogus--shams every stone of them!'\r\n\r\nNow, all this time our heroine had been sitting unperceived in a corner\r\nbehind a window-curtain, reading 'The Wide, Wide World,' a work which\r\nshe was never weary of perusing. Some children would have come forward\r\nearlier, but Priscilla was never a forward child, and she remained as\r\nquiet as a little mouse up to the moment when she could control her\r\nfeelings no longer.\r\n\r\n'It isn't true!' she cried passionately, bursting out of her retreat and\r\nconfronting her cousin; 'it's cruel and unkind to say my jewels are\r\nshams! They are real--they are, they _are_!'\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Prissie!' said her abandoned cousin; 'so you combine\r\njewel-dropping with eaves-dropping, eh?'\r\n\r\n'How dare you!' cried Aunt Margarine, almost beside herself, 'you odious\r\nlittle prying minx, setting up to teach your elders and your betters\r\nwith your cut and dried priggish maxims! When I think how I have petted\r\nand indulged you all this time, and borne with the abominable litter you\r\nleft in every room you entered--and now to find you are only a little,\r\nconceited, hypocritical impostor--oh, _why_ haven't I words to express\r\nmy contempt for such conduct--why am I dumb at such a moment as this?'\r\n\r\n'Come, mother,' said her son soothingly, 'that's not such a bad\r\nbeginning; I should call it fairly fluent and expressive, myself.'\r\n\r\n'Be quiet, Dick! I'm speaking to this wicked child, who has obtained our\r\nlove and sympathy and attention on false pretences, for which she ought\r\nto be put in prison--yes, in _prison_, for such a heartless trick on\r\nrelatives who can ill afford to be so cruelly disappointed!'\r\n\r\n'But, aunt!' expostulated poor Priscilla, 'you always said you only kept\r\nthe jewels as souvenirs, and that it did you so much good to hear me\r\ntalk!'\r\n\r\n'Don't argue with _me_, miss! If I had known the stones were wretched\r\ntawdry imitations, do you imagine for an instant----?'\r\n\r\n'Now, mother,' said Dick, 'be fair--they were uncommonly good\r\nimitations, you must admit that!'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, indeed I thought they were real, the fairy never told me!'\r\n\r\n'After all,' said Dick, 'it's not Priscilla's fault. She can't help it\r\nif the stones aren't real, and she made up for quality by quantity\r\nanyhow; didn't you, Prissie?'\r\n\r\n'Hold your tongue, Richard; she _could_ help it, she knew it all the\r\ntime, and she's a hateful, sanctimonious little stuck-up viper, and so I\r\ntell her to her face!'\r\n\r\nPriscilla could scarcely believe that kind, indulgent, smooth-spoken\r\nAunt Margarine could be addressing such words to her; it frightened her\r\nso much that she did not dare to answer, and just then Cathie and Belle\r\ncame into the room.\r\n\r\n'Oh, mother,' they began penitently, 'we're _so_ sorry, but we couldn't\r\nfind dear Prissie anywhere, so we haven't picked up anything the whole\r\nafternoon!'\r\n\r\n'Ah, my poor darlings, you shall never be your cousin's slaves any more.\r\nDon't go near her, she's a naughty, deceitful wretch; her jewels are\r\nfalse, my sweet loves, false! She has imposed upon us all, she does not\r\ndeserve to associate with you!'\r\n\r\n'I always said Prissie's jewels looked like the things you get on\r\ncrackers!' said Belle, tossing her head.\r\n\r\n'Now we shall have a little rest, I hope,' chimed in Cathie.\r\n\r\n'I shall send her home to her parents this very night,' declared Aunt\r\nMargarine; 'she shall not stay here to pervert our happy household with\r\nher miserable _gewgaws_!'\r\n\r\nHere Priscilla found her tongue. 'Do you think I _want_ to stay?' she\r\nsaid proudly; 'I see now that you only wanted to have me here\r\nbecause--because of the horrid jewels, and I never knew they were false,\r\nand I let you have them all, every one, you know I did; and I wanted you\r\nto mind what I said and not trouble about picking them up, but you\r\n_would_ do it! And now you all turn round upon me like this! What have I\r\ndone to be treated so? What have I done?'\r\n\r\n'Bravo, Prissie!' cried Dick. 'Mother, if you ask me, I think it serves\r\nus all jolly well right, and it's a downright shame to bullyrag poor\r\nPrissie in this way!'\r\n\r\n'I _don't_ ask you,' retorted his mother, sharply; 'so you will kindly\r\nkeep your opinions to yourself.'\r\n\r\n'Tra-la-la!' sang rude Dick, 'we are a united family--we are, we are, we\r\n_are_!'--a vulgar refrain he had picked up at one of the burlesque\r\ntheatres he was only too fond of frequenting.\r\n\r\nBut Priscilla came to him and held out her hand quite gratefully and\r\nhumbly. 'Thank you, Dick,' she said; '_you_ are kind, at all events. And\r\nI am sorry you couldn't have your horse-shoe pin!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, _hang_ the horse-shoe pin!' exclaimed Dick, and poor Priscilla was\r\nso thoroughly cast down that she quite forgot to reprove him.\r\n\r\nShe was not sent home that night after all, for Dick protested against\r\nit in such strong terms that even Aunt Margarine saw that she must give\r\nway; but early on the following morning Priscilla quitted her aunt's\r\nhouse, leaving her belongings to be sent on after her.\r\n\r\nShe had not far to walk, and it so happened that her way led through the\r\nidentical lane in which she had met the fairy. Wonderful to relate,\r\nthere, on the very same stone and in precisely the same attitude, sat\r\nthe old lady, peering out from under her poke-bonnet, and resting her\r\nknotty old hands on her crutch-handled stick!\r\n\r\nPriscilla walked past with her head in the air, pretending not to\r\nnotice her, for she considered that the fairy had played her a most\r\nmalicious and ill-natured trick.\r\n\r\n'Heyday!' said the old lady (it is only fairies who can permit\r\nthemselves such old-fashioned expressions nowadays). 'Heyday, why,\r\nhere's my good little girl again! Isn't she going to speak to me?'\r\n\r\n'No, she's not,' said Priscilla--but she found herself compelled to\r\nstop, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n'Why, what's all this about? You're not going to sulk with me, my dear,\r\nare you?'\r\n\r\n'I think you're a very cruel, bad, unkind old woman for deceiving me\r\nlike this!'\r\n\r\n'Goodness me! Why, didn't the jewels come, after all?'\r\n\r\n'Yes--they came, only they were all horrid artificial ones--and it is a\r\nshame, it _is_!' cried poor Priscilla from her bursting heart.\r\n\r\n'Artificial, were they? that really is very odd! Can you account for\r\nthat at all, now?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I can't! You told me that they would drop out whenever I said\r\nanything to improve people--and I was _always_ saying _something_\r\nimproving! Aunt had a bandbox in her room quite full of them.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, you've been very industrious, evidently; it's unfortunate your\r\njewels should all have been artificial--most unfortunate. I don't know\r\nhow to explain it, unless'--(and here the old lady looked up queerly\r\nfrom under her white eyelashes), 'unless your goodness was artificial\r\ntoo?'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?' asked Priscilla, feeling strangely uncomfortable.\r\n'I'm sure I've never done anything the least bit naughty--how can my\r\ngoodness possibly be artificial?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, that I can't explain; but I know this--that people who are really\r\ngood are generally the last persons to suspect it, and the moment they\r\nbecome aware of it and begin to think how good they are, and how bad\r\neverybody else is, why, somehow or other, their goodness crumbles away\r\nand leaves only a sort of outside shell behind it. And--I'm very old,\r\nand of course I may be mistaken--but I think (I only say I _think_,\r\nmind) that a little girl so young as you must have some faults hidden\r\nabout her somewhere, and that perhaps on the whole she would be better\r\nemployed in trying to find them out and cure them before she attempted\r\nto correct those of other people. And I'm sure it can't be good for any\r\nchild to be always seeing herself in a little picture, just as she likes\r\nto fancy other people see her. Very many pretty books are written about\r\ngood little girls, and it is quite true that children may exercise a\r\ngreat influence for good--more than they can ever tell, perhaps--but\r\nonly just so long as they remain natural and unconscious, and not\r\nunwholesome little pragmatical prigesses; for then they make themselves\r\nand other people worse than they might have been. But of course, my\r\ndear, you never made such a mistake as that!'\r\n\r\nPriscilla turned very red, and began to scrape one of her feet against\r\nthe other; she was thinking, and her thoughts were not at all pleasant\r\nones.\r\n\r\n'Oh, fairy,' she said at last, 'I'm afraid that's just what I _did_ do.\r\nI was always thinking how good I was and putting everybody--papa, mamma,\r\nAlick, Betty, Aunt Margarine, Cathie, Belle, and even poor cousin\r\nDick--right! I have been a horrid little hateful prig, and that's why\r\nall the jewels were rubbish. But, oh, shall I have to go on talking sham\r\ndiamonds and things all the rest of my life?'\r\n\r\n'That,' said the fairy, 'depends entirely on yourself. You have the\r\nremedy in your own hands--or lips.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, you mean I needn't talk at all? But I must--sometimes. I couldn't\r\nbear to be dumb as long as I lived--and it would look so odd, too!'\r\n\r\n'I never said you were not to open your lips at all. But can't you try\r\nto talk simply and naturally--not like little girls or boys in any\r\nstory-books whatever--not to \"show off\" or improve people; only as a\r\ngirl would talk who remembers that, after all, her elders are quite as\r\nlikely as she is to know what they ought or ought not to do and say?'\r\n\r\n'I shall forget sometimes, I know I shall!' said Priscilla\r\ndisconsolately.\r\n\r\n'If you do, there will be something to remind you, you know. And by and\r\nby, perhaps, as you grow up you may, quite by accident, say something\r\nsincere and noble and true--and then a jewel will fall which will really\r\nbe of value!'\r\n\r\n'No!' cried Priscilla, 'no, _please_! Oh, fairy, let me off that! If I\r\n_must_ drop them, let them be false ones to punish me--not real. I don't\r\nwant to be rewarded any more for being good--if I ever am really good!'\r\n\r\n'Come,' said the fairy, with a much pleasanter smile, 'you are not a\r\nhopeless case, at all events. It shall be as you wish, then, and perhaps\r\nit will be the wisest arrangement for all parties. Now run away home,\r\nand see how little use you can make of your fairy gift.'\r\n\r\nPriscilla found her family still at breakfast.\r\n\r\n'Why,' observed her father, raising his eyebrows as she entered the\r\nroom, 'here's our little monitor--(or is it _monitress_, eh,\r\nPriscilla?)--back again. Children, we shall all have to mind our p's and\r\nq's--and, indeed, our entire alphabet, now!'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure,' said her mother, kissing her fondly, 'Priscilla knows we're\r\nall delighted to have her home!'\r\n\r\n'_I'm_ not,' said Alick, with all a boy's engaging candour.\r\n\r\n'Nor am I,' added Betty, 'it's been ever so much nicer at home while\r\nshe's been away!'\r\n\r\nPriscilla burst into tears as she hid her face upon her mother's\r\nprotecting shoulder. 'It's true!' she sobbed, 'I don't deserve that you\r\nshould be glad to see me--I've been hateful and horrid, I know--but, oh,\r\nif you'll only forgive me and love me and put up with me a little, I'll\r\ntry not to preach and be a prig any more--I will truly!'\r\n\r\nAnd at this her father called her to his side and embraced her with a\r\nfervour he had not shown for a very long time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI should not like to go so far as to assert that no imitation diamond,\r\nruby, pearl, or emerald ever proceeded from Priscilla's lips again.\r\nHabits are not cured in a day, and fairies--however old they may be--are\r\nstill fairies; so it _did_ occasionally happen that a mock jewel made an\r\nunwelcome appearance after one of Priscilla's more unguarded utterances.\r\nBut she was always frightfully ashamed and abashed by such an accident,\r\nand buried the imitation stones immediately in a corner of the garden.\r\nAnd as time went on the jewels grew smaller and smaller, and frequently\r\ndissolved upon her tongue, leaving a faintly bitter taste, until at last\r\nthey ceased altogether and Priscilla became as pleasant and unaffected a\r\ngirl as she who may now be finishing this history.\r\n\r\nAunt Margarine never sent back the contents of that bandbox; she kept\r\nthe biggest stones and had a brooch made of them, while, as she never\r\nmentioned that they were false, no one out of the family ever so much\r\nas suspected it.\r\n\r\nBut, for all that, she always declared that her niece Priscilla had\r\nbitterly disappointed her expectations--which was perhaps the truest\r\nthing that Aunt Margarine ever said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A MATTER OF TASTE_\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a little singular that, upon an engagement becoming known and\r\nbeing discussed by the friends and acquaintances of the persons\r\nprincipally concerned, by far the most usual tone of comment should be a\r\nsorrowing wonder. That particular alliance is generally the very last\r\nthat anybody ever expected. 'What made him choose _her_, of all people,'\r\nand 'What on earth she could see in _him_,' are declared insoluble\r\nproblems. It is confidently predicted that the engagement will never\r\ncome to anything, or that, if such a marriage ever does take place, it\r\nis most unlikely to prove a success.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the case of female friends, this tone is even perceptible\r\nunder their warmest felicitations, and through the smiling mask of\r\ncompliment shine eyes moist with the most irritating quality of\r\ncompassion. 'So glad! so delighted! But why, _why_ didn't you consult\r\n_me_?'--this complicated expression might be rendered: 'I could have\r\nsaved you from this--I _was_ so pleased to hear of it!'\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in the majority of cases, these unions are not found to turn\r\nout so very badly after all, and the misguided couple seem really to\r\nhave gauged their own hearts and their possibilities of happiness\r\ntogether more accurately than the most clear-sighted of their\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nThe announcement that Ella Hylton had accepted George Chapman provoked\r\nthe customary sensation and surprise in their respective sets, and\r\nperhaps with rather more justification than usual.\r\n\r\nMiss Hylton had undeniable beauty of a spiritual and rather _exalté_\r\ntype, and was generally understood to be highly cultivated. She had\r\nspent a year at Somerville, though she had gone down without trying for\r\na place in either 'Mods.' or 'Greats,' thereby preserving, if not\r\nincreasing, her reputation for superiority. She had lived all her life\r\namong cultured people; she was devoted to music and regularly attended\r\nthe Richter Concerts, though she could seldom be induced to play in\r\npublic; she had a feeling for art, though she neither painted nor drew;\r\na love of literature strong enough to deter her from all amateur efforts\r\nin that direction. In art, music and literature she was impatient of\r\nmediocrity; and, while she was as fond as most girls of the pleasures\r\nwhich upper middle-class society can offer, she reverenced intellect,\r\nand preferred the conversation of the plainest celebrity to the\r\nplatitudes of the mere dancing-man, no matter how handsome of feature\r\nand perfect of step he might be.\r\n\r\nGeorge Chapman was certainly not a mere dancing-man, his waltzing being\r\nrather conscientious than dreamlike, and he was only tolerably\r\ngood-looking. On the other hand, he was not celebrated in any way, and\r\neven his mother and sisters had never considered him brilliant. He had\r\nbeen educated at Rugby and Trinity, Cambridge, where he rowed a fairly\r\ngood oar, on principle, and took a middle second in the Moral Science\r\nTripos. Now he was in a solicitor's office, where he was receiving a\r\ngood salary, and was valued as a steady, sensible young fellow, who\r\ncould be thoroughly depended upon. He was fond of his profession, and\r\nhad acquired a considerable knowledge of its details; apart from it he\r\nhad no very decided tastes; he lived a quiet, regular life, and dined\r\nout and went to dances in moderation; his manner, though he was nearly\r\ntwenty-six, was still rather boyishly blunt.\r\n\r\nWhat there was in him that had found favour in Ella Hylton's fastidious\r\neyes the narrator is not rash enough to attempt to particularise. But it\r\nmay be suggested that the most unlikely people may possess their fairy\r\nrose and ring which render them irresistible to at least one heart, if\r\nthey only have faith to believe in and luck to perceive their power.\r\n\r\nSo, early in the year, George had plucked up courage to propose to Miss\r\nHylton, after meeting and secretly adoring her for some months past, and\r\nshe, to the general astonishment, had accepted him.\r\n\r\nHe had a private income--not a large one--of his own, and had saved out\r\nof it. She was entitled under her grandmother's will to a sum which made\r\nher an heiress in a modest way, and thus there was no reason why the\r\nengagement should be a long one, and, though no date had been definitely\r\nfixed for the marriage, it was understood that it should take place at\r\nsome time before the end of the summer.\r\n\r\nSoon after the engagement, however, an invalid aunt with whom Ella had\r\nalways been a great favourite was ordered to the south of France, and\r\nimplored her to go with her; which Ella, who had a real affection for\r\nher relative, as well as a strong sense of duty, had consented to do.\r\n\r\nThis was a misfortune in one of two ways: it either curtailed that most\r\nnecessary and most delightful period during which _fiancés_ discover one\r\nanother's idiosyncrasies and weaknesses, or it made it necessary to\r\npostpone the marriage.\r\n\r\nGeorge naturally preferred the former, as the more endurable evil; but\r\nElla's letters from abroad began to hint more and more plainly at delay.\r\nHer aunt might remain on the Continent all the summer, and she could not\r\npossibly leave her; there was so much to be done after her return that\r\ncould not be done in a hurry; they had not even begun to furnish the\r\npretty little house on Campden Hill that was to be their new home--it\r\nwould be better to wait till November, or even later.\r\n\r\nThe mere idea was alarming to George, and he remonstrated as far as he\r\ndared; but Ella remained firm, and he grew desperate.\r\n\r\nHe might have spared himself the trouble. About the middle of June\r\nElla's aunt--who, of course, had had to leave the Riviera--grew tired of\r\ntravelling, and Ella, to George's intense satisfaction, returned to her\r\nmother's house in Linden Gardens, Notting Hill.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when our story opens, George, who had managed to get away from\r\noffice-work two hours before his usual time, was hurrying towards Linden\r\nGardens as fast as a hansom could take him, to see his betrothed for the\r\nfirst time after their long separation.\r\n\r\nHe was eager, naturally, and a little nervous. Would Ella still persist\r\nin her wish for delay? or would he be able to convince her that there\r\nwere no obstacles in the way? He felt he had strong arguments on his\r\nside, if only--and here was the real seat of his anxiety--if only her\r\nobjections were not raised from some other motive! She might have been\r\ntrying to prepare him for a final rupture, and then--'Well,' he\r\nconcluded, with his customary good sense, 'no use meeting trouble\r\nhalfway--in five minutes I shall know for certain!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mrs. Hylton and her daughter Flossie, a vivacious\r\ngirl in the transitionary sixteen-year-old stage, were in the\r\ndrawing-room at Linden Gardens. It was the ordinary double drawing-room\r\nof a London house, but everything in it was beautiful and harmonious.\r\nThe eye was vaguely rested by the delicate and subdued colour of walls\r\nand hangings; cabinets, antique Persian pottery, rare bits of china, all\r\noccupied the precise place in which their decorative value was most\r\nfelt; a room, in short, of exceptional individuality and distinction.\r\n\r\nFlossie was standing at the window, from which a glimpse could just be\r\ncaught of fresh green foliage and the lodge-gates, with the bustle of\r\nthe traffic in the High Street beyond; Mrs. Hylton was writing at a\r\nFlemish bureau in the corner.\r\n\r\n'I suppose,' said Flossie meditatively, as she fingered a piece of old\r\nstained glass that was hanging in the window, 'we shall have George here\r\nthis afternoon.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hylton raised her head. She had a striking face, tinted a clear\r\nolive, with a high wave of silver hair crowning the forehead; her\r\neyebrows were dark, and so were the brilliant eyes; the nose was\r\naquiline, and the thin, well-cut mouth a little hard. She was a woman\r\nwho had been much admired in her time, and who still retained a certain\r\nattraction, though some were apt to find her somewhat cold and\r\nunsympathetic. Her daughter Ella, for example, was always secretly a\r\nlittle in awe of her mother, who, however, had no terrors for audacious,\r\noutspoken Flossie.\r\n\r\n'If he comes, Flossie, he will be very welcome,' she said, 'but I hardly\r\nexpect him yet. George is not likely to neglect his duties, even for\r\nElla.'\r\n\r\nFlossie pursed her mouth rather scornfully: 'Oh, George is immaculate!'\r\nshe murmured.\r\n\r\n'If he was, it would hardly be a reproach,' said her mother, catching\r\nthe word; 'but, at all events, George has thoroughly good principles,\r\nand is sure to succeed in the world. I have every reason to be pleased.'\r\n\r\n'Every reason?--ah! but _are_ you pleased? Mother, dear, you know he's\r\nas dull as dull!'\r\n\r\n'Ella does not find him so--and, Flossie, I don't like to hear you say\r\nsuch things, even in Ella's absence.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I never abuse him to Ella; it wouldn't be any use: she's firmly\r\nconvinced that he's perfection--at least she was before she went away.'\r\n\r\n'Why? do you mean that she has altered?--have you seen any sign of it,\r\nFlossie?'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hylton made this inquiry sharply, but not as if such a circumstance\r\nwould be altogether displeasing to her.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no; only she hasn't seen him for so long, you know. Perhaps, when\r\nshe comes to look at him with fresh eyes, she'll notice things more. Ah,\r\nhere _is_ George, just getting out of a hansom--so he has played truant\r\nfor once! There's one thing I _do_ think Ella might do--persuade him to\r\nshave off some of those straggly whiskers. I wonder why he never seems\r\nto get a hat or anything else like other people's!'\r\n\r\nPresently George was announced. He was slightly above middle height,\r\nbroad-shouldered and fresh-coloured; the obnoxious whiskers did indeed\r\ncover more of his cheeks than modern fashion prescribes for men of his\r\nage, and had evidently never known a razor; he wore a turn-down collar\r\nand a necktie of a rather crude red; his clothes were neat and well\r\nbrushed, but not remarkable for their cut.\r\n\r\n'Well, my dear George,' said Mrs. Hylton, 'we have seen very little of\r\nyou while Ella has been away.'\r\n\r\n'I know,' he said awkwardly; 'I've had a lot of things to look after in\r\none way and another.'\r\n\r\n'What? after your work at the office was over!' cried Flossie\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n'Yes--after that; it's taken up my time a good deal.'\r\n\r\n'And so you couldn't spare any to call here--I see!' said Flossie.\r\n'George,' she added, with a sudden diversion, 'I wonder you aren't\r\nafraid of catching cold! How _can_ you go about in such absurdly thin\r\nboots as those?'\r\n\r\n'These?' he said, inspecting them doubtfully--they were strong, sensible\r\nboots with notched and projecting soles of ponderous thickness--'why,\r\nwhat's the matter with them, Flossie, eh? Don't you think they're strong\r\nenough for walking in?'\r\n\r\n'No, George; they're the very things for an afternoon dance, and quite a\r\nlot of couples could dance in them, you see. But for walking--ah, I'm\r\nafraid you sacrifice too much to appearances.'\r\n\r\n'I don't, really!' George protested in all good faith; 'now _do_ I, Mrs.\r\nHylton?'\r\n\r\n'Flossie is making fun of you, George; you mustn't mind her\r\nimpertinence.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, is that all? Do you know, I really thought for the moment that she\r\nmeant they were too small for me! You like getting a rise out of me,\r\nFlossie, don't you?'\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed with such genuine and good-natured amusement that the\r\nyoung lady felt somehow a little small, and almost ashamed, although it\r\ntook the form of suppressed irritation. 'He really ought not to come\r\nhere in such things,' she said to herself; 'and I don't believe that,\r\neven now, he sees what I meant.'\r\n\r\nJust at this point Ella came in, with the least touch of shyness,\r\nperhaps, at meeting him before witnesses after so long an absence; but\r\nshe only looked the more charming in consequence, and, demure as her\r\ngreeting was, her pretty eyes had a sparkle of pleasure that scattered\r\nall George Chapman's fears to the winds. Even Flossie felt instinctively\r\nthat straggly-whiskered, red-necktied, thick-booted George had lost\r\nnone of his divinity for Ella.\r\n\r\nThey did not seem to have much to say to one another, notwithstanding;\r\npossibly because Ella was called upon to dispense the tea which had just\r\nbeen brought in. George sat nursing the hat which Flossie found so\r\nobjectionable, while he balanced a teacup with the anxious eye of a\r\njuggler out of practice, and the conversation flagged. At last, under\r\npretence of renewing his tea, most of which he had squandered upon a\r\nPersian rug, he crossed to Ella: 'I say,' he suggested, 'don't you think\r\nyou could come out for a little while? I've such lots to tell you\r\nand--and I want you to go somewhere with me.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hylton made no objection, beyond stipulating that Ella must not be\r\nallowed to tire herself after her journey, and so, a few minutes later,\r\nMiss Hylton came down in her pretty summer hat and light cape, and she\r\nand George were allowed to set out.\r\n\r\nOnce outside the house, he drew a long breath of mingled relief and\r\npleasure: 'By Jove, Ella, I am glad to get you back again! I say, how\r\njolly you do look in that hat! Now, do you know where I'm going to take\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'It will be quietest in the Gardens,' said Ella.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but that's not where you're going now,' he said with a delicious\r\nassumption of authority; 'you're coming with me to see a certain house\r\non Campden Hill you may have heard of.'\r\n\r\n'That will be delightful. I do want to see our dear little house again\r\nvery much. And, George, we will go carefully over all the rooms, and\r\nsettle what can be done with each of them. Then we can begin directly;\r\nwe haven't too much time.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' he said with a conscious laugh, 'it won't take so much time\r\nas you think.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, but it _must_--to do properly. And while I've been away I've had\r\nsome splendid ideas for some of the rooms--I've planned them out so\r\nbeautifully. You know that delightful little room at the back?--the one\r\nI said should be your own den, with the window all festooned with\r\ncreepers and looking out on the garden--well----?'\r\n\r\n'Take my advice,' he said, 'and don't make any plans till you see it.\r\nAnd as for plans, these furnishing fellows do all that--they don't care\r\nto be bothered with plans.'\r\n\r\n'They will have to carry out ours, though. I shall love settling how it\r\nis all to be--it will be such fun.'\r\n\r\n'You wouldn't call it fun if you knew what it was like, I can tell you.'\r\n\r\n'But I _do_ know. Mother and I rearranged most of the rooms at home only\r\nlast year--so you see I have some experience. And what experience can\r\n_you_ have had, if you please?'\r\n\r\nElla had a mental vision as she spoke of the house in Dawson Place when\r\nGeorge lived with his mother and sisters--a house in which furniture and\r\neverything else were commonplace and _bourgeois_ to the last degree,\r\nand where nothing could have been altered since his boyhood; indeed she\r\nhad often secretly pitied him for having to live in such surroundings,\r\nand admired the filial patience that had made him endure them so long.\r\n\r\n'I've had my share, Ella, and I should be very sorry for you to have all\r\nthe worry and bother I've been through over it!'\r\n\r\n'But when, George? How? I don't understand.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, that's my secret!' he said provokingly; 'and you know, Ella, if we\r\nbegan furnishing now, it would take no end of a time, with all these\r\nwonderful plans of yours, and--and I couldn't stand having to wait till\r\nnext November for you--I couldn't do it!'\r\n\r\n'Mother thinks the marriage need not be put off now,' said Ella simply,\r\n'and we shall have six weeks till then; the house can be quite ready for\r\nus by the time we want it.'\r\n\r\n'Six weeks!' he said impatiently, 'what's six weeks? You've no idea what\r\nthese chaps are, Ella! And then there are all your own things to get,\r\nand they would take up most of your time. No, we should have had to put\r\nit off, whatever you may say. And that would mean another\r\nseparation--for, of course, you would go away in August, and I should\r\nhave to stay in town: the office wouldn't give me my fortnight twice\r\nover--honeymoon or no honeymoon!'\r\n\r\nElla looked completely puzzled. 'But what are you trying to prove\r\n_now_, George?'\r\n\r\n'I was only showing you that, even though you have come back earlier, we\r\ncouldn't possibly have got things ready in time, if I hadn't----' but\r\nhere he stopped. 'No, I want that to be a surprise for you, Ella; you'll\r\nsee presently,' he added.\r\n\r\nElla's delicate eyebrows contracted. 'I like to be prepared for my\r\nsurprises, please, George. Tell me now.'\r\n\r\nThey had turned up one of the quiet streets leading to the hill. They\r\nwere so near the house that George thought he might abandon further\r\nmystery, not to mention that he was only too anxious to reveal his\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\n'Well, then, Ella, if you must have it,' he said triumphantly, 'the\r\nhouse is very nearly ready _now_--what do you think of that?'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean that--that it is furnished, George?'\r\n\r\n'Papered, painted, decorated, furnished--everything, from top to bottom!\r\nI thought that would surprise you, Ella!'\r\n\r\n'I think,' she answered slowly, 'you might have told me you were doing\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'What! before it was all done? That would have spoilt it all, dear. I\r\nshould have written, though, if you hadn't been coming home so soon. And\r\nnow it's finished I must say it looks uncommonly jolly. I'm sure you'll\r\nbe pleased with it--it looks quite a different place.'\r\n\r\nShe tried to smile: 'And did you do it all yourself, George?'\r\n\r\n'Well, no--not exactly. I flatter myself I know how to see that the\r\nwork's properly done, and all that; but there are some things I don't\r\npretend to be much of a hand at, so I got certain ladies to give me some\r\nwrinkles.'\r\n\r\nElla felt relieved. She was disappointed, it is true--hurt, even, at\r\nhaving been deprived of any voice in the matter. She had been looking\r\nforward so much to carrying out her pet schemes, to enjoying her\r\nfriends' admiration of the wonders wrought by her artistic invention.\r\nAnd she had never thought of George, somehow, as likely to have any\r\nstrikingly original ideas on the subject of decoration, although she\r\nliked him none the less for that.\r\n\r\nBut it was something that he had had the good sense to take her mother\r\nand Flossie into his confidence: she knew she could trust them to\r\npreserve him from any serious mistakes.\r\n\r\n'You see,' said George, half apologetically, 'I would ever so much\r\nrather have waited till you came back, only I couldn't tell when that\r\nwould be. I really couldn't help myself. You're sure you don't mind\r\nabout it? If you only knew how I worked over it, rushing about from one\r\nplace to another, as soon as I could get away from the office, picking\r\nup bits of furniture here and there, standing over those beggars of\r\npainters and keeping 'em at it, and working out estimates and seeing\r\nforemen and managers and all kinds of chaps! I used to get home\r\ndead-tired of an evening; but I didn't mind that: I felt it was all\r\nbringing you nearer to me, darling, and that made everything a\r\npleasure!'\r\n\r\nThere was such honest affection in his look and voice; he had so\r\nevidently intended to please her, and had been in such manifest dread of\r\nany further separation from her, that she was completely disarmed.\r\n\r\n'Dear George,' she said gently, 'I am so sorry you took all the trouble\r\non yourself; it was very, very good of you to care so much, and I know I\r\nshall be delighted with the house.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said George, 'I'm not much afraid about that, because I expect\r\nour tastes are pretty much the same in most things.'\r\n\r\nThey were by this time at the house, and George, after a little fumbling\r\nwith his as yet unfamiliar latchkey, threw open the door with a flourish\r\nand said, 'There you are, little woman! Walk in and you'll see what you\r\nshall see!'\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Ella inside the hall than her heart sank: 'Looks neat and\r\nnice, doesn't it?' said George cheerfully. 'You'd almost take that paper\r\nfor real marble, wouldn't you? See how well they've done those veins. I\r\nlike this yellowish colour better than green, don't you? It looks so\r\ncool in summer. That's a good strong hall-lamp--not what you call high\r\nart, exactly--but gives a rattling good light, and that's the main\r\nthing. Here, I'll light it up for you--confound it! they haven't turned\r\nthe gas on yet. However, there's too much sunshine for it to show much,\r\nif they had. This linoleum is a capital thing: you might scrub as long\r\nas you liked and you'd never get _that_ pattern out!'\r\n\r\n'No,' Ella agreed, with a tragic little smile, 'it--it looks as if it\r\nwould last.'\r\n\r\n'Last! I should just think so! And here's a hatstand--you could almost\r\nswear it was carved wood of some sort, but it's only cast-iron painted;\r\nindestructible, you see; they told me that was the latest\r\ndodge--wonderful how cheaply they turn them out, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'I thought you said you were helped?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I didn't want any help _here_--this is only the passage, you know!'\r\n\r\nYes, it was only the passage--and yet she had been picturing such a\r\ncharming entrance, with a draped arch, a graceful lamp, a fresh bright\r\npaper, a small buffet of genuine old oak, and so on. She suppressed a\r\nsigh as she passed on; after all, so long as the rooms themselves were\r\nall right, it did not so very much matter, and she knew that her\r\nmother's taste could be trusted.\r\n\r\nBut on the threshold of the dining-room she stopped aghast. The walls\r\nhad been distempered a particularly hideous drab; the curtains were\r\nmustard yellow; the carpet was a dull brown; the mottled marble\r\nmantelpiece, for which she had been intending to substitute one in\r\nwalnut wood with tiles, still shone in slabs of petrified brawn; there\r\nwas a huge mahogany sideboard of a kind she had only seen in\r\nold-fashioned hotels.\r\n\r\n'Comfortable, eh?' remarked George. 'Lots of wear in those curtains!'\r\n\r\nUnhappily there was, as Ella was only too well aware. 'You did _this_\r\nroom yourself too, then, George?' she managed to say, without betraying\r\nherself by her voice.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I chose everything here. You see, Ella, we shall only use this\r\nroom for meals.'\r\n\r\n'Only for meals, yes,' she acquiesced with a shudder; 'but--George,\r\nsurely you said mother had helped you with the rooms?'\r\n\r\n'What! your mother? No, Ella; her notions are rather too grand for me.\r\nIt was Jessie and Carrie I meant. Just come and see what they've made of\r\nmy den.'\r\n\r\nElla followed. The window--which had commanded such a cheerful outlook\r\ninto one of the pretty gardens, with a pink thorn, a laburnum-tree or\r\ntwo, and some sycamores which still flourish fresh and fair on Campden\r\nHill--was obscured now by some detestable contrivance in transparent\r\npaper imitating stained glass.\r\n\r\n'That was the girls' notion,' said George, following the direction of\r\nher eyes; 'they fixed it all themselves--it was their present to me.\r\nPretty of them to think of it, wasn't it? I call it an immense\r\nimprovement, and, you see, it's stuck on with some patent cement\r\nvarnish, so it can't rub off. You get the effect better if you stand\r\nhere--_now_, see how well the colours come out in the sun!'\r\n\r\nIf only they _would_ come out! But what could she do but stand and\r\nadmire hypocritically? Her eyes, in spite of herself, seemed drawn to\r\nthat bright-hued sham intersected by black lines intended to represent\r\nleading; of the room itself she only saw vaguely that it was not\r\nunworthy of the window.\r\n\r\n'Nothing to what they've done with the drawing-room!' said innocent\r\nGeorge, beaming; 'come along, darling, you'll scarcely know the place.'\r\n\r\nAnd Ella, reduced to a condition of stony stupor, followed to the\r\ndrawing-room. She did not know the place, indeed. It was a\r\nquaintly-shaped, irregular room, with French windows opening upon the\r\ngarden on one side and a deep bow-window on another; when she had last\r\nseen it, the walls were covered with a paper so pleasing in tone and\r\ndesign that she had almost decided to retain it. That paper was gone,\r\nand in its place a gaudy semi-Chinese pattern of unknown birds, flying\r\nand perching on sprawling branches laden with impossible flowers. And\r\nthen the furniture--the 'elegant drawing-room suite' in brilliant plush\r\nand shiny satin, the cheap cabinets, and the ready-made black and gilt\r\novermantel, with its panels of swans, hawthorn-blossom, and landscapes\r\nsketchily daubed on dead gold--surely it had all been transferred bodily\r\nfrom the stage of some carelessly mounted farcical comedy!\r\n\r\nElla's horrified gaze gradually took in other features--the china\r\nmonkeys swinging on cords, the porcelain parrots hanging in great brass\r\nrings, huge misshapen terra-cotta jars and pots, dead grass in bloated\r\ndrain-pipes, tambourines, beribboned and painted with kittens and\r\nrobins, enormous wooden _sabots_, gilded Japanese fans, a woolly white\r\nrug and a bright Kidderminster carpet.\r\n\r\n'_Oh_, George!' burst involuntarily from her lips.\r\n\r\n'I knew you'd be pleased!' he said complacently; 'but I mustn't take all\r\nthe credit myself. It was like this, you see: I felt all right enough\r\nabout the other rooms, but the drawing-room--that's _your_ room, and I\r\nwas awfully afraid of not having it exactly as it ought to be. So I went\r\nto the girls, and I said, \"_You_ know all about these things--just make\r\nit what you think Ella will like, and then we can't go wrong!\" We had\r\nthat Grosvenor Gallery paper down first of all. \"Choose something bright\r\nand cheerful,\" I said, and I don't think they've chosen badly. Then the\r\npottery and china and all that--those are the girls' presents to _you_,\r\nwith their best love.'\r\n\r\n'It--it's very good of them,' said poor Ella, on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\n'Oh, they think a lot of you! They were rather nervous about doing\r\nanything at first, for fear you mightn't like it; but I told them they\r\nneedn't be afraid. \"What I like, Ella will like,\" I said; and, I must\r\nsay, no one could wish to see a prettier drawing-room than they've\r\nturned it into--they've a good deal of taste, those two girls.'\r\n\r\nElla stood there in a kind of dreary dream. What had happened to the\r\nworld since she came into this house? What was this change in her? She\r\nwas afraid to speak, lest the intense rebellious anger she felt should\r\ngain the mastery. Was it she that had these wicked thoughts of\r\nGeorge--poor, kind, unsuspecting, loving George? She felt a little\r\nfaint, for the windows were closed and the room stuffy with the odour of\r\nthe new furniture and the atmosphere of the workshop; everything here\r\nseemed to her commonplace and repulsive.\r\n\r\n'How about those plans of yours now, Ella, eh?' cried George.\r\n\r\nThis was too much; her overtried patience broke down. 'George!' she\r\ncried impulsively, and her voice sounded hoarse and strange to her own\r\near; 'George! I must speak--I must tell you!----' and then she checked\r\nherself. She must keep command of herself, or she could not, without\r\nutter loss of dignity, find the words that were to sting him into a\r\nsense of what he had done and allowed to be done. Before she could go\r\non, George had drawn her to him, and was patting her shoulder tenderly.\r\n'I know, dear little girl,' he said, 'I know; don't try to tell me\r\nanything. I'm so awfully glad you're pleased; but all the money and\r\npains in the world wouldn't make the place good enough for my Ella!'\r\n\r\nShe released herself with a little cry of impotent despair. How could\r\nshe say the sharp, cruel speeches that were struggling to reach her\r\ntongue now? It was no use; she was a coward; she simply had not the\r\ncourage to undeceive him here, on the very first day of their reunion,\r\ntoo!\r\n\r\n'You haven't been upstairs yet,' said George, dropping sentiment\r\nabruptly; 'shall we go up?'\r\n\r\nElla assented submissively, much as even this cost her; but it was\r\nbetter, she reflected, to get it over and know the very worst. However,\r\nshe was spared this ordeal for the present; as they returned to the\r\nhall, they found themselves suddenly face to face with a dingy man,\r\nwhose face was surrounded by a fringe of black whiskers and crowned by a\r\nshock of fleecy hair.\r\n\r\n'Who on earth are you?' demanded George, as the man rose from the\r\nkitchen-stairs.\r\n\r\n'No offence, sir and lady! Peagrum, that's _my_ name, fust shop round\r\nthe corner as you go into Silver Street, plumber and sanitry hengineer,\r\ngas-fittin' and hartistic decorating, bell-'anging in all its branches.\r\nI received instructions from Mr. Jones that I was to look into a little\r\nmatter o' leakage in the back-kitchen sink; also to see what taps, if\r\nhany, required seein' to, and gen'ally to put things straight like. So I\r\ncome round, 'aving the keys, jest to cast a heye over them, as I may\r\nterm it, preliminry to commencing work in the course of a week or so, as\r\nsoon as I'm at libity to attend to it pussonally.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, the landlord sent you? All right, then.'\r\n\r\n'Correct, sir,' said the plumber affably. 'While I've been 'ere, I took\r\nthe freedom of going all over this little 'ouse, and a nice cosy little\r\n'ouse you've made of it, for such a nouse as it is! You've done it up\r\nvery tysty--very tysty you've done this little 'ouse up; and I've some\r\nclaim to speak, seein' as how I've had the decoration throughout of a\r\nmany 'ouses in my time, likewise mansions. You ain't been too ambitious,\r\nwhich is the error most parties falls into with small 'ouses. Now the\r\nparties as 'ad the place before you--by the name o' Rummles--well, I\r\ndaresay they satisfied theirselves, but the 'ouse never looked\r\nright--not to _my_ taste, it didn't!'\r\n\r\n'George, get rid of this person!' said Ella rapidly, under her breath,\r\nin French. Unfortunately, George's acquaintance with that tongue was\r\nabout on a par with the plumber's, and he remained passive.\r\n\r\nThe plumber now proceeded to put down his mechanic's straw-bag upon the\r\nhall-table, which he did with great care, as if it were of priceless\r\nstuff and contained fragile articles; having done this, he posed himself\r\nwith one elbow resting on the post at the foot of the staircase, like a\r\ngrimy statue of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n'Ah,' he said, shaking his touzled head, 'this ain't the fust time I've\r\nbeen 'ere in my puffessional capacity, not by a long way. Not by a long\r\nway, it ain't. Mr. Rummles, him as I mentioned to you afore, and a nice\r\npleasant-spoken gentleman he was, too--in the tea trade--Mr. Rummles, he\r\nallus sent round for me whenever there was hany odd jobs as wanted\r\ndoin', and in course I was allus pleased to get 'em, be they hodd or\r\nhotherwise.'\r\n\r\n'Er-exactly,' said George, as soon as he could put in a word; 'but you\r\nsee, this lady and I----'\r\n\r\nThe plumber, however, did not abandon his position, and seemed\r\ndetermined that they should hear him:\r\n\r\n'I know, sir--I see how things were with you with 'arf a glance; but\r\nafore we go any further, it's right you should know 'oo I am and all\r\nabout me. Jest 'ear what I'm goin' to tell you, for it's somethink out\r\nof the common way, though gospel-truth. It's a melinkly reflection for a\r\nman in my station of life, but'--and here he lowered his voice to a\r\nsolemn pitch--'I've never set foot inside of this 'ere 'ouse without\r\nsomethink 'appens more or less immejit. Ah, it's true, though. Seems\r\nalmost like as if I brought a fatality in along o' me. Don't you\r\ninterrupt; you wait till I'm done, and see if I'm talking at random or\r\nwithout facks to support me. Well, _fust_ time as ever I was sent for\r\n'ere was in regard to drains, as they couldn't flush satisfactory. I did\r\nmy work and come away. Not three weeks arter, Miss Rummles, the heldest\r\ngell, was took ill with typhoid. Never the same young lady again--nor\r\nyet she never won't be neither, not if she lives to a nundered. \"Nothing\r\nvery hodd about _that_?\" says you. Wait a bit. Next time, it was the\r\nkitching copper as had got all furred up like. I tinkered that up to\r\nrights, and come away. Well, afore I'd even made out my account, that\r\nidentical copper blew up and scalded the cook dreadful! \"Coppers will\r\nplay these games,\" you sez. All right, then; but you let me finish.\r\nThird time there was a flaw in one of the gas-brackets in the spare\r\nroom. I soddered it up and I come away. Soon arterwards, a day or two as\r\nit might be, Mrs. Rummles 'ad 'er mar a-stayin' with her, and the old\r\nlady slep in that very room, and was laid up weeks! \"Curus,\" says I,\r\nwhen I come to 'ear of it, \"_very_ curus!\" and it set me a-thinkin'.\r\nLast time but one--'ere, lemme see--that was a bell-'anging job, I\r\n_think_--no, I'm wrong, it was drains agen, so it were--drains it was\r\nagen. And the _next_ thing I 'eard was that Mrs. Rummles was a-layin' at\r\ndeath's door with the diffthery! The last time--ah, I recklect well, I\r\nwas called in to see if somethink wasn't wrong with the ballcock in the\r\ntop cistin. I see there _was_ somethink, and I come away as usual. That\r\nday week, old Mr. Rummles was took with a fit on the floor in the back\r\ndroring-room, which broke up the 'ouse!\r\n\r\n'Now, I think, as fair-minded and unprejudiced parties, you'll agree\r\nwith me that there was something more'n hordinary coinside-ency in all\r\nthat. I declare to you!' avowed the plumber, with a gloomy relish and a\r\ncandour that was possibly begotten of beer, 'I declare to you there's\r\ntimes when I do honestly believe as I carry a curse along with me\r\nwhenever I visits this 'ere partickler 'ouse! and, though it's agen my\r\nown hinterests, I deem it on'y my dooty, as a honest man, to mention\r\nit!'\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances, the plumber's compliments on her taste\r\nand his lugubrious assumption of character of the Destroying Angel would\r\nhave sorely tried, if not completely upset, Ella's gravity; as it was,\r\nshe was too wretched to have more than a passing and quite\r\nunappreciative sense of his absurdity. George, having the quality of\r\nmind which makes jokes more readily than sees them, took him quite\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he answered solemnly, 'I hope you won't bring _us_ bad luck, at\r\nall events!'\r\n\r\n'_I_ 'ope so, sir, I'm sure. I _'ope_ so. It will not be by any desire\r\non my part, more partickler when you're just settin' up 'ousekeepin'\r\nwith your good lady 'ere. But there's no tellin' in these matters.\r\nThat's where it is, you see--there's no tellin'. And, arter all my\r\nexperence, with the best intentions in the world, I can't go and\r\nguarantee to you as nothink won't come of it. I wish I could, but, as a\r\nhonest man, I can't. If it's to be,' moralised this fatalistic plumber,\r\n'it _is_ to be, and that's all about it, and no hefforts on my part or\r\nyours won't make hany difference, will they, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Well, well,' said George, plainly ill at ease, 'that will do, my\r\nfriend. Now, Ella, what do you say--shall we go upstairs?'\r\n\r\n'Not now,' she gasped, 'let us go away--. Oh, George, take me outside,\r\nplease!'\r\n\r\n'Dash that confounded fool of a plumber!' said George, irritably, when\r\nthey were in the street again; 'wonder if he thinks I'm going to employ\r\nhim after that! Not that it isn't all bosh, of course---- Why, Ella,\r\nyou're not tired, are you?'\r\n\r\n'I--I think I am a little--do you mind if we drive home?'\r\n\r\nElla was very silent during their short drive. When they reached Linden\r\nGardens she said, 'I think we must say good-bye here, George. I feel as\r\nif I were going to have a headache.'\r\n\r\n'You poor little girl!' he said, looking rather crestfallen, for he had\r\nbeen counting upon going in and being invited to remain for dinner,\r\n'it's been rather too much for you, going over the house and all\r\nthat--or was it that beastly plumber with his rigmaroles?'\r\n\r\n'It wasn't the plumber,' she said hurriedly, as the door was opened,\r\n'and--good-bye, George.'\r\n\r\n'How easily girls do get knocked up!' thought George, as he walked\r\nhomeward, 'a little pleasant excitement like this and she seems quite\r\nupset. She was delighted with the house, though, that's one blessing,\r\nand I mustn't forget to tell the girls how touched she was by their\r\npresents. What a darling she is, and how happy we shall be together!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce safely at home, Ella hastened upstairs to her own room, where, if\r\nthe truth must be told, she employed the half-hour before dinner in\r\nunintermittent sobbing, into which temper largely entered. 'He has\r\nspoilt it all for me! How _could_ he--oh, how could he?' ran the burden\r\nof her moan. At the dinner-table, though pale and silent, she had\r\nrecovered composure.\r\n\r\n'A pleasant walk, Ella?' inquired her mother, with rather formal\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n'Yes, very,' replied Ella, trusting she would not be questioned further.\r\n\r\n'I believe I know where you went!' cried indiscreet Flossie. 'You went\r\nto look at your new home--now, _didn't_ you? Ah, I thought so! I\r\nsuppose you have quite made up your minds how you mean to do the rooms?'\r\n\r\n'Quite.'\r\n\r\n'We might go round to all the best places to-morrow,' said Mrs. Hylton,\r\n'and see some papers and hangings--there were some lovely patterns in\r\nBlank's windows the other day.'\r\n\r\n'And, Ella,' added Flossie, 'I've been out with Andrews after school\r\nseveral times, to Tottenham Court Road, and Wardour Street, and Oxford\r\nStreet--oh, everywhere, hunting up old furniture, and I can show you\r\nwhere they have some beautiful things--not shams, but really good!'\r\n\r\n'You know, Ella,' said Mrs. Hylton, observing that she did not answer,\r\n'I want you to have a pretty house, and you and George must order\r\nexactly what you like; but I think you will find I may be some help to\r\nyou in choosing.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, mother,' said Ella, without any animation; 'I--I don't think\r\nwe shall want much.'\r\n\r\n'You will want all that young people in your position do want, I\r\nsuppose,' said Mrs. Hylton, a little impatiently; 'and of course you\r\nunderstand that the bills are to be my affair.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, mother,' murmured Ella again. She didn't feel able to tell\r\nthem just yet how this had all been forestalled; she felt that she would\r\ninfallibly break down if she tried.\r\n\r\n'You seem a little overdone to-night, my dear,' said her mother\r\nfrigidly; she was naturally hurt at the very uneffusive way in which her\r\ngood offices had been met.\r\n\r\n'I have such a dreadful headache,' pleaded Ella. 'I--I think I overtired\r\nmyself this afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Then you were very foolish, after travelling all yesterday, as you did.\r\nI don't wonder that George was ashamed to come in. You had better go to\r\nbed early, and I will send Andrews in to you with some of my sleeping\r\nmixture.'\r\n\r\nElla was glad enough to obey, though the draught took some time to\r\noperate; she felt as if no happiness or peace of mind were possible for\r\nher till George had been persuaded to undo his work.\r\n\r\nSurely he could not refuse when he knew that her mother was prepared to\r\ndo everything for them at her own expense!\r\n\r\nAnd here it began to dawn upon her what this would entail! George's\r\nwords came back to her as if she heard them actually spoken. Did he not\r\nsay that the house had been furnished out of his savings?\r\n\r\nWhat was she asking him to do? To dismantle it entirely; to humiliate\r\nhimself by going round to all the people he had dealt with, asking them\r\nas a favour to take back their goods, or else he must sell them as best\r\nhe could for a fraction of their cost. Who was to refund him all he had\r\nso uselessly spent? Could she ask her mother to do so? Would he even\r\nconsent to such an arrangement if it was proposed?\r\n\r\nThen his sisters--how could she avoid offending them irreparably,\r\nperhaps involving George in a quarrel with his family, if she were to\r\ncarry her point?\r\n\r\nAs she realised, for the first time, the inevitable consequences of\r\nsuccess, she asked herself in despair what she ought to do--where her\r\nplain duty lay?\r\n\r\nDid she love George--or was it all delusion, and was he less to her than\r\nmere superfluities, the fringe of life?\r\n\r\nShe did love him, in spite of any passing disloyalty of thought. She\r\nfelt his sterling worth and goodness, even his weaknesses had something\r\nlovable in them for her.\r\n\r\nAnd he had been planning, spending, working all this time to give her\r\npleasure, and this was his reward! She had been within an ace of letting\r\nhim see the cruel ingratitude that was in her heart! 'What a selfish\r\nwretch I have been!' she thought; 'but I won't be--no, I won't! George\r\nshall _not_ be snubbed, hurt, estranged from his family on my account!'\r\n\r\nNo, she would suffer--she alone--and in silence. Never by a word would\r\nshe betray to him the pain his well-intentioned action cost her. Not\r\neven to her mother and Flossie would she permit herself to utter the\r\nleast complaint, lest they should insist upon opening George's eyes!\r\n\r\nSo, having arrived at this heroic resolve, in which she found a touch of\r\nthe sublime that almost consoled her, the tears dried on her cheeks and\r\nElla fell asleep at last.\r\n\r\nSome readers, no doubt--though possibly few of our heroine's sex--will\r\nsmile scornfully at this crumpled rose-leaf agony, this tempest in a\r\nDresden teacup; and the writer is not concerned to deny that the\r\nsituation has its ludicrous side.\r\n\r\nBut, for a girl brought up as Ella Hylton had been, in an artistic\r\n_milieu_, her eye insensibly trained to love all that was beautiful in\r\ncolour and form, to be almost morbidly sensitive to ugliness and\r\nvulgarity--it was a very real and bitter struggle, a hard-won victory to\r\ncome to such a decision as she formed. Life, Heaven knows, contains\r\nworse trials and deeper tragedies than this; but at least Ella's happy\r\nlife had as yet known no harder.\r\n\r\nAnd, so far, she must be given the credit of having conquered.\r\n\r\nResolution is, no doubt, half the battle. Unfortunately, Ella's\r\nresolution, though she hardly perceived this at present, could not be\r\neffected by one isolated and final act, but by a long chain of daily and\r\nhourly forbearances, the first break in which would undo all that had\r\ngone before.\r\n\r\nHow she bore the test we are going to see.\r\n\r\nShe woke the next morning to a sense that her life had somehow lost its\r\nsavour; the exaltation of her resolve overnight had gone off and left\r\nher spirits flat and dead; but she came down, nevertheless, determined\r\nto be staunch and true to George under all provocations.\r\n\r\n'Have you and George decided when you would like your wedding to be?'\r\nasked her mother, after breakfast, 'because we ought to have the\r\ninvitations printed very soon.'\r\n\r\n'Not yet,' faltered Ella, and the words might have passed either as an\r\nanswer or an appeal.\r\n\r\n'I think it should be some time before the end of next month, or people\r\nwill be going out of town.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose so,' was the reply, so listlessly given that Mrs. Hylton\r\nglanced keenly at her daughter.\r\n\r\n'What do you feel about it yourself, Ella?'\r\n\r\n'I? oh, I--I've no feeling. Perhaps, if we waited--no, it doesn't\r\nmatter--let it be when you and George wish, mother, please!'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hylton gave a sharp, annoyed little laugh: 'Really, my dear, if you\r\ncan't get up any more interest in it than that, I think it would\r\ncertainly be wiser to wait!'\r\n\r\nIt was more than indifference that Ella felt--a wild aversion to\r\nbeginning the new life that but lately had seemed so mysteriously sweet\r\nand strange; she was frightened by it, ashamed of it, but she could not\r\nhelp herself. She made no answer, nor did Mrs. Hylton again refer to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBut Ella's worst tribulations had yet to come. That afternoon, as she\r\nand her mother and Flossie were sitting in the drawing-room, 'Mrs. and\r\nthe Miss Chapmans' were announced. Evidently they had deemed it\r\nincumbent on them to pay a state visit as soon as possible after Ella's\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nElla returned their effusive greetings as dutifully as she could. She\r\nhad never succeeded in cultivating a very lively affection for them;\r\nto-day she found them barely endurable.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chapman was a stout, dewlapped old lady, with dull eyes and\r\npachydermatous folds in her face. She had a husky voice and a funereal\r\nmanner. Jessie, her eldest daughter, was not altogether uncomely in a\r\ncommonplace way: she was dark-haired, high-coloured,\r\nloud-voiced--generally sprightly and voluble and overpowering; she was\r\nin such a hurry to speak that her words tripped one another up, and she\r\nhad a meaningless and, to Ella, highly irritating little laugh.\r\n\r\nCarrie was plain and colourless, content to admire and echo her sister.\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation on Ella's Continental experiences, Jessie\r\nsuddenly, as Ella's uneasy instinct foresaw, turned to Mrs. Hylton. 'Of\r\ncourse, Ella told you what a surprise she had at Campden Hill yesterday?\r\nWeren't you electrified?'\r\n\r\n'No doubt I should have been,' said Mrs. Hylton, who detested Jessie,\r\n'only Ella did not think fit to mention it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I wonder at that! I hope I wasn't going to betray the secrets of\r\nthe prison-house?' Jessie was fond of using stock phrases to give\r\nlightness and sparkle to her conversation. 'Ella, the idea of your\r\nkeeping it all to yourself, you sly puss! But tell me--would you ever\r\nhave believed Tumps'--his sisters called George 'Tumps'--'could be\r\ncapable of such independent behaviour?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Ella, 'I--indeed I never should!'\r\n\r\n'Ha, ha! nor should we! You would have screamed to see him fussing\r\nabout--wasn't he killing over it, Carrie?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, he was, Jessie!'\r\n\r\n'My son,' explained Mrs. Chapman to Mrs. Hylton, 'is so wonderfully\r\nenergetic and practical. I have never known him fail to carry through\r\nanything he has once undertaken--he inherits that from his poor dear\r\nfather.'\r\n\r\n'I don't quite gather what your brother George has been doing, even\r\nnow?' said Mrs. Hylton to Jessie.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but my lips are sealed. Wild horses sha'n't drag any more from me!\r\nDon't be afraid, Ella, I won't spoil sport!'\r\n\r\n'There is no sport to spoil,' said Ella. 'Mother, it is only that--that\r\nGeorge has furnished the house while I have been away.'\r\n\r\n'Really?' said Mrs. Hylton politely; 'that _is_ energetic of him,\r\nindeed!'\r\n\r\n'Poor dear Tumps came home so proud of your approval,' said Jessie to\r\nElla, 'and we were awfully relieved to find you didn't think we'd made\r\nthe house quite too dreadful--weren't we, Carrie?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, indeed, Jessie.'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' observed the latter young lady, 'it's always so hard to hit\r\nupon another person's taste exactly--especially in furnishing.'\r\n\r\n'Impossible, I should have thought,' from Mrs. Hylton.\r\n\r\n'I hope Ella is of a different opinion--what do _you_ say, dearest?'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' cried Ella hastily, with splendid mendacity, 'I--I liked it all\r\nvery much, and--and it was so much too kind of you and Carrie. I've\r\nnever thanked you for--for all the things you gave me!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, _those_! they ain't worth thanking for--just a few little artistic\r\nodds and ends. They set off a room, you know--give it a finish.'\r\n\r\n'Young people nowadays,' croaked old Mrs. Chapman lugubriously in Mrs.\r\nHylton's courteously inclined ear, 'think so much of luxury and\r\nornament. I'm sure when I married my dear husband, we----'\r\n\r\n'Now, mater dear, you really _mustn't_!' interrupted the irrepressible\r\nJessie; 'Mrs. Hylton is on _our_ side, you know. She likes pretty things\r\nabout her--don't you, Mrs. Hylton? And, talking of that, Ella, I hope\r\nyou thought our glyco-vitrine decoration a success? We were perfectly\r\nsurprised ourselves to see how well it came out! Just transparent\r\ncoloured paper, Mrs. Hylton, and you cut it into sheets, and gum it on\r\nthe window-panes, and really, unless you were told or came quite close,\r\nyou would declare it was real stained glass! You ought to try some of it\r\non your windows, Mrs. Hylton. I'll tell you where you can get it--you go\r\ndown----'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I'm old-fashioned, my dear,' said Mrs. Hylton, stiffly; 'if\r\nI cannot have the reality, I prefer to do without even the best\r\nimitations.'\r\n\r\n'Why, you're deserting us, I declare! Ella, you must take her to see the\r\nwindow, and then perhaps she will change her opinion.'\r\n\r\n'I always tell my girls,' said Mrs. Chapman, in her woolly voice, 'when\r\nI am dead and gone they can make any alterations they please, but while\r\nI am spared to them I like everything about the house to be kept exactly\r\nas it was in their poor father's lifetime.'\r\n\r\n'_Isn't_ she a dear conservative old mummy?' said Jessie to Ella in an\r\naudible aside. 'Why, I do believe she won't see anything to admire in\r\nyour little house--at least, if she does, the dear old lady, she'd\r\nsooner die than admit it!'\r\n\r\nThe Chapmans went at last, and before they were out of the house Mrs.\r\nHylton, with an effort to seem unconcerned, said: 'And so, Ella, you and\r\nGeorge have done without my help? Of course you know your own affairs\r\nbest; still, I should have thought--I should certainly have\r\nthought--that I might have been of some assistance to you--if only in\r\npecuniary matters.'\r\n\r\n'George preferred that you should not be troubled,' stammered Ella.\r\n\r\n'I am not blaming him. I respect him for wishing to be independent. I\r\nown to being a little surprised that you should not have told me of this\r\nbefore, though, Ella. But for that chattering girl, I presume I should\r\nhave been left to discover it for myself. I wonder you cannot bring\r\nyourself to be a little more open with your mother, my dear.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, mother!' cried Ella in despair, 'indeed I was going to tell\r\nyou--only, I did not know myself till yesterday. At least, that is----'\r\nshe broke off lamely, fearing to reflect on George.\r\n\r\n'I find it hard to believe that George would act without consulting you\r\nin any way. It is strange enough that he should have undertaken to\r\nfurnish the house in your absence.'\r\n\r\n'But if I couldn't be there!' pleaded Ella--'and I couldn't.'\r\n\r\n'Naturally, as you were on the Continent, you couldn't be on Campden\r\nHill at the same time; you need not be absurd, Ella. But what I want to\r\nknow is this--have you had a voice in the matter, or have you not?'\r\n\r\n'N--not much,' confessed Ella, hanging her head.\r\n\r\n'So I suspected, and I think George ought to be ashamed of himself. I\r\nnever heard of such a thing, and I shall make a point of seeing the\r\nhouse and satisfying myself that it is fit for a daughter of mine to\r\ninhabit.'\r\n\r\n'Mother!' exclaimed Ella, springing up excitedly, 'you don't understand.\r\nWhy should you choose to suppose that the house is not pretty? It is not\r\ndone as _you_ would do it, because poor George hadn't much money to\r\nspend; but if I am satisfied, why should you come between us? And I _am_\r\nsatisfied--quite, quite satisfied; he has done it all beautifully, and I\r\nwill not have a single thing altered! After all, it is _his_ house--our\r\nhouse--and nobody else has any right to interfere--not even you,\r\nmother!'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hylton shrugged her shoulders. 'Oh, my dear, if that is the way you\r\nthink proper to speak to me, it is time to change the subject. Pray\r\nunderstand that I shall not dream of interfering. I am very glad that\r\nyou are so satisfied.' And by-and-by she left the room majestically.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone, Flossie, who had been listening open-eyed to all that\r\nhad taken place, came and stood in front of Ella's chair.\r\n\r\n'Ella, tell me,' she said, 'has George really furnished the house\r\nexactly as you like--_really_ now?'\r\n\r\n'Haven't I said so, Flossie? Why should you doubt it?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know; I was wondering, that was all!'\r\n\r\n'Really!' cried Ella angrily, 'anyone would think poor George was a sort\r\nof barbarian, who couldn't be expected to know anything, or trusted to\r\ndo anything!'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure I never _said_ so, Ella. But how clever of him to choose just\r\nthe right things! And, Ella, do all the colours and things go well\r\ntogether? I always thought most men didn't notice much about all that.\r\nAnd are the new mantelpieces pretty? Oh, and where did he go for the\r\npapers and the carpets?'\r\n\r\n'Flossie, I wish you wouldn't tease so. Can't you see I have a headache?\r\nI can't answer so many questions, and I won't! Once for all, everything\r\nis just what I like. Do you understand, or shall I tell you\r\nagain?--just, _just_ what I like!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' returned Flossie, with exasperating good-humour; 'then\r\nthere's nothing to lose your temper about, darling, is there?'\r\n\r\nAnd this was all that Ella had gained by her loyalty to George so far.\r\n\r\nIt was the morning after the Chapmans' visit. Ella had seen her mother\r\nand Flossie preparing to go out, but, owing to the friction between\r\nthem, they neither invited her to accompany them, nor did she venture to\r\nask where they were going. At luncheon, however, the unhappy girl\r\ndivined from the expression of their faces how they had employed the\r\nforenoon. They had been inspecting the Campden Hill house! Her mother's\r\nhandsome face wore a look of frozen contempt. Imagine a strict Quaker's\r\nfeelings on seeing his son with a pair of black eyes--a Socialist's at\r\nfinding a peerage under his daughter's pillow--a Positivist's whose\r\nchildren have all joined the Salvation Army, and even then but a faint\r\nidea will be reached of Mrs. Hylton's utter dismay and disgust.\r\n\r\nFlossie, though angry, took a different view of Ella's share in the\r\nbusiness; she knew her better than her mother did, and consequently\r\nrefused to believe that she was a Philistine at heart. It was her absurd\r\ninfatuation for George that made her see with his eyes and bow down\r\nbefore the hideous household gods he had chosen to erect. On such\r\nweakness Flossie had no mercy.\r\n\r\n'Well, Ella, dear,' she began, 'mother and I have seen your house.\r\nGeorge has quite surpassed our wildest expectations. Accept my\r\ncompliments!'\r\n\r\n'Flossie,' said her mother severely, 'will you kindly choose some other\r\ntopic? I really feel too seriously annoyed about all this to bear to\r\nhear it spoken of just yet. I think you shall come with me to the\r\nAmberleys' garden-party this afternoon, and not Ella, as we are dining\r\nout this evening. You had better stay at home and rest, Ella.'\r\n\r\nIn this, and countless other ways, was Ella made to feel that she was in\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nNor did Flossie spare her sister when they were alone. 'Poor dear\r\nmother!' she said, 'I quite thought that house would have broken her\r\nheart--oh, I'm not saying a word against it, Ella, I know _you_ like it,\r\nand I'm sure it looks very comfortable--everything so sensible and\r\nuseful, and the kitchen really charming; mother and I liked it best of\r\nall the rooms. Such a horrid man let us in; he was at work there, and he\r\nwould follow us all about, and tell mother his entire history. I don't\r\nthink he _could_ have been quite sober, he would insist on turning all\r\nthe taps on everywhere. I suppose, Ella, it's ever so much _cheaper_ to\r\nfurnish as you and George have done; that's the worst of pretty things,\r\nthey do cost such a lot! I'd no idea you were so practical, though,' and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday George came to luncheon. He was delighted to hear from Flossie\r\nthat they had been to the house, and gave a boisterously high-spirited\r\naccount of his labours. 'It _was_ a grind,' he informed them, 'and, as\r\nfor those painter-fellows, I began to think they'd stay out the entire\r\nlease.'\r\n\r\n'Art is long, George,' observed Flossie, wickedly.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, I know; but they promised faithfully to be out in ten days, and\r\nthey were over three weeks!'\r\n\r\n'But look at the result! George, how _did_ you find out that Ella liked\r\ngrained doors?'\r\n\r\n'Well, to tell you the truth, Flossie, that was a bit of a fluke. The\r\nman told me that graining was coming in again, and I said, \"Grain 'em,\r\nthen\"--_I_ didn't know!'\r\n\r\nIn short, he was more provokingly dense than ever to-day, and Ella found\r\nherself growing more and more captious and irritable that afternoon; he\r\ncould not understand why she was so disinclined to talk; even the dear\r\nlittle house of which she was so soon to be the mistress failed to\r\ninterest her.\r\n\r\n'You have told me twice already that you got the drawing-room carpet a\r\ngreat bargain, and only paid four pounds ten for the table in the\r\ndining-room,' she broke out. 'Can't we take that for granted in future?'\r\n\r\n'I forgot I'd told you; I thought it was the mater,' he said; 'and I\r\nsay, Ella, how about pictures? Jessie's promised to do us some\r\nwater-colours--she's been taking lessons lately, you know--but we shall\r\nwant one or two prints for the dining-room, shan't we? You can pick them\r\nup second-hand very cheap.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, yes; anything you please, George!... No, no; I'm not cross, I'm\r\nonly tired, especially of talking about the house. It is quite finished,\r\nyou know, so what _is_ there to discuss?'\r\n\r\nDuring the days that followed, Flossie devised an ingenious method of\r\ntormenting Ella; she laid out her pocket-money, of which she had a good\r\ndeal, on the most preposterous ornaments--a pair of dangling cut-glass\r\nlustres, bead mats, a trophy of wax fruit under a glass shade, gaudy\r\nfire-screens and flowerpots, all of which she solemnly presented to her\r\nsuffering sister. This was not pure mischief or unkindness on Flossie's\r\nside, but part of a treatment she had hit upon for curing Ella of her\r\nfolly. And at last the worm turned. Flossie came in one day with a cheap\r\nplush and terra-cotta panel of appalling ugliness.\r\n\r\n'For the drawing-room, dear,' she observed blandly, and Ella suddenly\r\nburst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n'You are very, very unkind to me, Flossie!' she sobbed.\r\n\r\n'I!' exclaimed Flossie, in a tone of the most innocent surprise. 'Why,\r\nElla, I thought you would be charmed with it. I'm sure _George_ will.\r\nAnd, you know, it will go beautifully with the rest of your things!'\r\n\r\n'You might understand ... you might see----'\r\n\r\n'I might see what?'\r\n\r\n'How _frightfully_ miserable I am!' said Ella, which was the very\r\nadmission Miss Flossie had been seeking to provoke.\r\n\r\n'Suppose I _do_ see,' she said; 'suppose I've been trying to get you to\r\nact sensibly, Ella?'\r\n\r\n'Then it's cruel of you!'\r\n\r\n'No it's not. It's kind. How am I to help you unless you speak out? I'm\r\nyounger than you, Ella, but I know this--_I_ would never mope and make\r\nmyself miserable when a word would put everything right!'\r\n\r\n'But it wouldn't, Flossie; it is too late to speak now. I can't tell\r\nhim how I really feel--I can't!'\r\n\r\n'Ah, then you own there is something to tell?'\r\n\r\n'What have I said? Flossie, forget what I said; it slipped out. I meant\r\nnothing.'\r\n\r\n'And you are perfectly happy and satisfied, are you? _Now_, I know how\r\npeople look when they are perfectly happy and satisfied.'\r\n\r\n'It's no use!' cried Ella, suddenly. 'I've tried, and tried, and tried\r\nto bear it, but I can't. I _must_ tell somebody ... it is making me ill.\r\nI am getting cross and wicked, and unlike what I used to be. Flossie, I\r\ncan't go and live there--I dread the thought of it; I shrink from it\r\nmore and more every day! It is all odious, impossible--and yet I must, I\r\nmust!'\r\n\r\n'No, you mustn't; and, what's more, you shan't!'\r\n\r\n'Flossie, you mean you will tell mother! You must not, do you hear? If\r\nyou do, it will only make matters worse. Oh, why did I tell you?' cried\r\nElla, in shame at this lapse from all her heroism. 'Promise me you will\r\nsay nothing to mother--it is too late now--promise!'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Flossie reluctantly; 'then I promise. But, all the\r\nsame, Ella, I think you're a great goose!'\r\n\r\n'I didn't promise I wouldn't say anything to _George_, though,' she\r\nreflected; and so, on the very next occasion that she caught him alone,\r\nshe availed herself of an innocent allusion of his to Ella's low\r\nspirits to give him the benefit of her candid opinion, which was not\r\ntempered by any marked consideration for his feelings.\r\n\r\nElla was in the morning-room alone--she had taken to sitting alone\r\nlately, brooding over her trials. She was no heroine, after all; her\r\nmind, it is to be feared, was far from superior. She was finding out\r\nthat she had undertaken too heavy a task; she could not console herself\r\nfor her lost dream of a charmingly appointed house. She might endure to\r\nlive in such a home as George had made for her; but to be expected to\r\nadmire it, to let it be understood that it was her handiwork, that she\r\nhad chosen or approved of it--this was the burden that was crushing her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened and George stood before her. His expression was\r\nso altered that she scarcely recognised him; all the cheery buoyancy had\r\nvanished, and his stern, set face had a dignity and character in it now\r\nthat were wanting before.\r\n\r\n'I have just had a talk with Flossie,' he began; 'she has shown me what\r\na--what a mistake I've been making.'\r\n\r\nElla could not help feeling a certain relief, though she said, 'It was\r\nvery wrong of Flossie--she had no right to speak.'\r\n\r\n'She had every right,' he said. 'She might have done it more kindly,\r\nperhaps, but that's nothing. Why didn't you tell me yourself, Ella? You\r\nmight have trusted me!'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't--it seemed so cruel, so ungrateful, after all you had done.\r\nI hoped you would never know.'\r\n\r\n'It's well for you, and for me too, that I know this while there's still\r\ntime. Ella, I've been a blind, blundering fool. I never had a suspicion\r\nof this till--till just now, or you don't think I should have gone on\r\nwith it a single minute. I came to tell you that you need not make\r\nyourself miserable any longer. I will put an end to this--whatever it\r\ncosts me.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, George, I am so ashamed. I know it is weak and cowardly of me, but\r\nI can't help it. And--and will it cost you so very much?'\r\n\r\n'Quite as much as I can bear.'\r\n\r\n'No; but tell me--about _how_ much? More than a hundred pounds?'\r\n\r\n'I haven't worked it out in pounds, shillings, and pence,' he said\r\ngrimly; 'but I should put it higher myself.'\r\n\r\n'Won't they take back some of the things? They ought to,' she suggested\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n'The things? Oh, the furniture! Good Heavens, Ella! do you suppose I\r\ncare a straw about that? All I can think of is how I could have gone on\r\ndeceiving myself like this, believing I knew your every thought; and all\r\nthe time--pah, what a fool I've been!'\r\n\r\n'I thought I should get used to it,' she pleaded. 'And oh, you don't\r\nknow how hard I have tried to bear it, not to let anyone see what I\r\nfelt--you don't know!'\r\n\r\n'And I would rather not know,' he replied, 'for it's not exactly\r\nflattering, you see, Ella. And at all events, it's over now. This is the\r\nlast time I shall trouble you; you will see no more of me after to-day.'\r\n\r\nElla could only stare at him incredulously. Had he really taken the\r\nmatter so seriously to heart as this? Could he not forgive the wound to\r\nhis vanity? How hard, how utterly unworthy of him!\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he continued, 'I see now we were quite unsuited to one another. I\r\nshould never have made you happy, Ella; it's best to find it out before\r\nit's too late. So let us shake hands and say good-bye, my dear.'\r\n\r\nShe felt powerless to appeal to him, and yet it was not wholly pride\r\nthat tied her tongue; she was too shaken and stunned to make the least\r\neffort at remonstrance.\r\n\r\n'Then, if it must be,' she said at last, very low--'good-bye, George.'\r\n\r\nHe crushed her hand in his strong grasp. 'Don't mind about me,' he said\r\nroughly. 'You've nothing to blame yourself for. I daresay I shall get\r\nover it all right. It's rather sudden at first--that's all!' And with\r\nthat he was gone.\r\n\r\nFlossie, coming in a little later, found her sister sitting by the\r\nwindow, smiling in a strange, vacant way. '_Well?_' said Flossie\r\neagerly, for she had been anxiously waiting to hear the result of the\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n'It's all over, Flossie; he has broken it off.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Ella, I'm so glad! I _hoped_ he would, but I wasn't sure. Well,\r\nyou may thank me for delivering you, darling. If I hadn't spoken\r\nplainly----'\r\n\r\n'Tell me what you said.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, let me see. Well, I told him anybody else would have seen long ago\r\nthat your feelings were altered. I said you were perfectly miserable at\r\nhaving to marry him, only you thought it was too late to say so. I told\r\nhim he didn't understand you in the least, and you hadn't a single\r\nthought or taste in common. I said if he cared about you at all, the\r\nbest way he could prove it was by setting you free, and not spoiling\r\nyour life and his own too. I put it as pleasantly as I could,' said\r\nFlossie naïvely, 'but he is very trying!'\r\n\r\n'You told him all that! What made you invent such wicked, cruel lies?\r\nFlossie, it is you that have spoilt our lives, and I will never forgive\r\nyou--never, as long as I live!'\r\n\r\n'Ella!' cried the younger sister, utterly astonished at this outburst.\r\n'Why, didn't you tell me the other day how miserable you were, and how\r\nyou dared not speak about it? And now, when I----'\r\n\r\n'Go away, Flossie; you have done mischief enough!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, very well, I'm going--if this is all I get for helping you. Is it\r\n_my_ fault if you don't know your own mind, and say what you don't mean?\r\nAnd if you really want your dearly beloved George back again, there's\r\ntime yet; he hasn't gone--he's in the drawing-room with mother.'\r\n\r\nHow infinitely petty her past misery seemed now! for what trifles she\r\nhad thrown away George's honest heart! If only there was a chance still!\r\nat least false pride should not come between them any longer: so thought\r\nElla on her way to the drawing-room. George was still there; as she\r\nturned the door-handle she heard her mother's clear resonant tones. 'Not\r\nthat that is any excuse for Ella,' she was saying.\r\n\r\nElla burst precipitately into the room. She was only just in time, for\r\nGeorge had risen and was evidently on the point of leaving. 'George,'\r\nshe exclaimed, panting after her rapid flight, 'I--I came to tell\r\nyou----'\r\n\r\n'My dear Ella,' interrupted Mrs. Hylton, 'the kindest thing you can do\r\nfor George now is to let him go without any more explanations.'\r\n\r\nElla stopped; again her mind became a blank. What had she come for; what\r\nwas it she felt she must say? While she hesitated, George was already at\r\nthe other door; he seemed anxious to avoid hearing her; in another\r\nsecond he would be gone.\r\n\r\nShe cried to him piteously. 'George, dear George, don't leave me!... I\r\ncan't bear it!'\r\n\r\n'This is too ridiculous!' exclaimed her mother angrily. 'What is it that\r\nyou _do_ want, Ella?'\r\n\r\n'I want George,' she said simply. 'It was all a mistake, George. Flossie\r\nmistook---- Oh, you don't really think that I have left off caring for\r\nyou? I haven't, dear, indeed I haven't--won't you believe me?'\r\n\r\n'I had better leave you to come to an understanding together,' said Mrs.\r\nHylton, not in the best of tempers, for she had been more sorry for\r\nGeorge than for the rupture he came to announce, and she swept out of\r\nthe room with very perceptible annoyance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'I thought it was all up with me, Ella; I did indeed,' said George, a\r\nminute or two later, his face still pale after all this emotion. 'But\r\ntell me--what's wrong with the furniture I ordered?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing, dear, nothing,' she answered, blushing. 'Don't think about it\r\nany more.'\r\n\r\n'No? But your mother was talking about it too,' he insisted. 'Come,\r\nElla, dear, for heaven's sake let us have no more misunderstandings! I\r\nsee now what an ass I was not to wait and let you choose for yourself;\r\nthese æsthetic things are not in my line. But I'd no idea you'd care so\r\nmuch!'\r\n\r\n'But I don't now--a bit.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I do, then. And the house must be done all over again, and\r\nexactly as you would like it; so there's no more to be said about it,'\r\nsaid George, without a trace of pique or wounded vanity.\r\n\r\n'George, you are too good to me; I don't deserve it. And indeed you must\r\nnot--think of the expense!'\r\n\r\nHis face lengthened slightly; he knew well enough that the change would\r\ncost him dear.\r\n\r\n'I'll manage it somehow,' he declared stoutly.\r\n\r\nWould her mother help them now? thought Ella, and felt more than\r\ndoubtful. No, in spite of her own wishes, she must not allow George to\r\ncarry out his intentions.\r\n\r\n'But you forget Carrie and Jessie,' she said; 'we shall hurt their\r\nfeelings so if we change now.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove! I forgot that,' he said. 'Yes, they won't like it--they meant\r\nwell, poor girls, and took a lot of trouble. Still, you're the first\r\nperson to be considered, Ella. I'll try and smooth it over with them,\r\nand if they choose to be offended, why, they must--that's all. And I\r\ntell you what. Suppose we go and see the house now, and you shall tell\r\nme just what wants doing to make it right?'\r\n\r\nShe would have liked to decline this rather invidious office, especially\r\nas she felt no compromise to be possible; but he was so urgent that she\r\nfinally agreed to go with him.\r\n\r\nAs they gained Campden Hill and the road in which their house stood,\r\nGeorge stopped. 'Hullo!' he said, 'that can't be the house--what's the\r\nmatter with it?'\r\n\r\nVery soon it was pretty evident what had been the matter--the walls were\r\nscorched and streaming, the window sashes were empty, charred and wasted\r\nby fire, the door was blistered and blackened, a stalwart fireman in\r\nhis undress cap, with his helmet slung at his back, was just opening the\r\ngate as they came up.\r\n\r\n'Can't come in, sir,' he said, civilly enough. 'No one admitted.'\r\n\r\n'Hang it!' exclaimed George, 'it's my own fire--I'm the tenant.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I beg your pardon, sir--it's been got under some hours now. I was\r\njust going off duty.'\r\n\r\n'Much damage done?' inquired George laconically.\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, sir,' said the man, evidently considering how to prepare\r\nGeorge for the worst, 'we didn't get the call till the house was well\r\nalight, and there was three steamers and a manual a-playing on it,\r\nso--well, you must expect things to be a bit untidy-like inside. But the\r\nwalls and the roof ain't much damaged.'\r\n\r\n'And how did it happen?--the house isn't even occupied.'\r\n\r\n'Workmen,' said the man. 'Someone was in there early this morning and\r\nleft the gas escaping somewheres, and as likely as not a light burning\r\nnear--and here you are. Well, I'll be off, sir; there's nothing more to\r\nbe done 'ere. Good-day, sir, and thank ye, I'm sure.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, George!' said Ella, half crying, 'our poor, poor little house! It\r\nseems like a judgment on me. How _can_ you laugh! Who will build it up\r\nfor us now?'\r\n\r\n'Who? Why, the insurance people, to be sure! You see, the firm are\r\nagents for the \"Curfew,\" and as soon as I got all the furniture in I\r\ninsured the whole concern and got a protection note, so we're all right.\r\nDon't worry, little girl. Why, don't you see this gets us out of our\r\ndifficulty? We can start afresh now without offending anybody. Look\r\nthere; there's that idiot of a plumber who's done all the mischief--a\r\nnice funk he'll be in when he sees us!'\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Peagrum was quite unperturbed; if anything, his smudgy features\r\nwore a look of sombre complacency as he came towards them. 'I'm sorry\r\nthis should have occurred,' he said,'but you'll bear me out that I\r\nwarned yer as something was bound to 'appen. In course I couldn't tell\r\nwhat form it might take, and fire I must say I did _not_ expect. I\r\n'adn't on'y been in the place not a quarter of a hour, watering the\r\ngaselier in the libery--the libery as _was_, I _should_ say--when it\r\nstruck me I'd forgot my screw-driver, so, fortunately, as things turned\r\nout, I went 'ome to my place to get it, and I come back to see the place\r\nall in a blaze. It's fate, that's what it is--fate's at the bottom o'\r\nthis 'ere job!'\r\n\r\n'Much more likely to be a lighted candle,' said George.\r\n\r\n'I was not on the premises at the time, so I can't say; but, be that 'ow\r\nit may, there's no denying it's a singler thing the way my words have\r\nbeen fulfilled almost literal.'\r\n\r\n'Confound you!' said George. 'You take good care your prophecies come\r\noff. Why, man, you're not going to pretend you don't know that it's your\r\nown carelessness that's brought this about! This isn't the only house\r\nyou've brought bad luck into, Mr. What's-your-name, since you've started\r\nin business!'\r\n\r\n'You can't make me lose my temper,' replied the plumber with dignity. 'I\r\nput it down to ignirance.'\r\n\r\n'So do I,' said George. 'And if I know anyone who's anxious for a little\r\ntyphoid, or wants his house burnt down at a moderate charge, why, I\r\nshall know whom to recommend. Good-day.'\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel and walked off, but Ella lingered behind. 'I only\r\njust wanted to tell you,' she said, addressing the astonished plumber,\r\n'that you have done us a very great service, and I, at least, am very\r\nmuch obliged to you.' And she fluttered away after her _fiancé_.\r\n\r\nThe plumber--that instrument of Destiny--looked after the retreating\r\ncouple, and indulged in a mystified whistle.\r\n\r\n'_'E_ comes a bullyragging of me,' he observed to a lamp-post, 'and\r\nshe's \"very much obliged\"! And I'm blowed if I know what for, either\r\nway! Cracked, poor young things, cracked, the pair on 'em--and no\r\nwonder, with such a calamity so recent. Ah, well, I do 'ope as this is\r\nthe end on it. I 'ope I shan't be the means of bringing no more trouble\r\ninto that little 'ouse--that I kin truly say!'\r\n\r\nAnd--human gratitude having its limits--it is highly probable that this\r\npious aspiration will not be disappointed, so long, at least, as Mr. and\r\nMrs. Chapman's tenancy continues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DON; THE STORY OF A GREEDY DOG_\r\n\r\nA TALE FOR CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\n'Daisy, dearest,' said Miss Millikin anxiously to her niece one\r\nafternoon, 'do you think poor Don is quite the thing? He has seemed so\r\nvery languid these last few days, and he is certainly losing his\r\nfigure!'\r\n\r\nDaisy was absorbed in a rather ambitious attempt to sketch the lake from\r\nthe open windows of Applethwaite Cottage, and did not look up from her\r\ndrawing immediately. When she did speak her reply might perhaps have\r\nbeen more sympathetic. 'He _eats_ such a lot, auntie!' she said. 'Yes,\r\nDon, we _are_ talking about you. You know you eat too much, and that's\r\nthe reason you're so disgracefully fat!'\r\n\r\nDon, who was lying on a rug under the verandah, wagged his tail with an\r\nuneasy protest, as if he disapproved (as indeed he did) of the very\r\npersonal turn Daisy had given to the conversation. He had noticed\r\nhimself that he was not as active as he used to be; he grew tired so\r\nvery soon now when he chased birds (he was always possessed by a fixed\r\nidea that, if he only gave his whole mind to it, he could catch any\r\nswallow that flew at all fairly); he felt the heat considerably.\r\n\r\nStill, it was Don's opinion that, so long as he did not mind being fat\r\nhimself, it was no business of any other person's--certainly not of\r\nDaisy's.\r\n\r\n'But, Daisy,' cried Miss Millikin plaintively, 'you don't really mean\r\nthat I overfeed him?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' Daisy admitted, 'I think you give way to him rather, Aunt Sophy,\r\nI really do. I know that at home we never let Fop have anything between\r\nhis meals. Jack says that unless a small dog is kept on very simple diet\r\nhe'll soon get fat, and getting fat,' added Daisy portentously, 'means\r\nhaving fits sooner or later.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, my _dear_!' exclaimed her aunt, now seriously alarmed. 'What do you\r\nthink I ought to do about it?'\r\n\r\n'I know what I would do if he was _my_ dog,' said Daisy, with great\r\ndecision--'diet him, and take no notice when he begs at table; I would.\r\nI'd begin this very afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'_After_ tea, Daisy?' stipulated Miss Millikin.\r\n\r\n'No,' was the inflexible answer, '_at_ tea. It's all for his own good.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear, I'm sure you're right--but he has such pretty ways--I'm so\r\nafraid I shall forget.'\r\n\r\n'I'll remind you, Aunt Sophy. He shan't take advantage of you while\r\n_I'm_ here.'\r\n\r\n'You're just a tiny bit hard on him, Daisy, aren't you?'\r\n\r\n'Hard on Don!' cried Daisy, catching him up and holding him out at\r\narm's length. 'Don, I'm _not_ hard on you, am I? I love you, only I see\r\nyour faults, and you know it. You're full of deceitfulness' (here she\r\nkissed him between the eyes and set him down). 'Aunt Sophy, you would\r\nnever have found out his trick about the milk if it hadn't been for\r\nme--_would_ you now?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps not, my love,' agreed Miss Millikin mildly.\r\n\r\nThe trick in question was a certain ingenious device of Don's for\r\nobtaining a double allowance of afternoon tea--a refreshment for which\r\nhe had acquired a strong taste. The tea had once been too hot and burnt\r\nhis tongue, and, as he howled with the pain, milk had been added. Ever\r\nsince that occasion he had been in the habit of lapping up all but a\r\nspoonful or two of the tea in his saucer, and _then_ uttering a pathetic\r\nlittle yelp; whereupon innocent Miss Millikin would as regularly fill up\r\nthe saucer with milk again.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately for Don, his mistress had invited her niece Daisy to\r\nspend part of her summer holidays at her pretty cottage in the Lake\r\nDistrict, and Daisy's sharper eyes had detected this little stratagem\r\nabout the milk on the very first evening!\r\n\r\nDaisy was fourteen, and I fancy I have noticed that when a girl is about\r\nthis age, she not unfrequently has a tendency to be rather a severe\r\ndisciplinarian when others than herself are concerned. At all events\r\nDaisy had very decided notions on the proper method of bringing up\r\ndogs, and children too; only there did not happen to be any children at\r\nApplethwaite Cottage to try experiments upon; and she was quite sure\r\nthat Aunt Sophy allowed herself to be shamefully imposed upon by Don.\r\n\r\nThere was perhaps some excuse for Miss Millikin, for Don was a\r\nparticularly charming specimen of the Yorkshire terrier, with a silken\r\ncoat of silver-blue, set off by a head and paws of the ruddiest gold.\r\nHis manners were most insinuating, and his great eyes glowed at times\r\nunder his long hair, as if a wistful, loving little soul were trying to\r\nspeak through them. But, though it seems an unkind thing to say, it must\r\nbe confessed that this same soul in Don's eyes was never quite so\r\napparent as when he was begging for some peculiarly appetising morsel.\r\nHe was really fond of his mistress, but at meal times I am afraid he\r\n'put it on' a little bit. Of course this was not quite straightforward;\r\nbut then I am not holding him up as a model animal.\r\n\r\nHow far he understood the conversation that has been given above is more\r\nthan I can pretend to say, but from that afternoon he began to be aware\r\nof a very unsatisfactory alteration in his treatment.\r\n\r\nDon had sometimes felt a little out of temper with his mistress for\r\nbeing slow to understand exactly what he _did_ want, and he had barked,\r\nalmost sharply, to intimate to the best of his powers--'Not bread and\r\nbutter, stoopid--_cake_!' So you may conceive his disgust when she did\r\nnot even give him bread and butter; nothing but judicious\r\nadvice--_without_ jam. She was most apologetic, it is true, and\r\nexplained amply why she could not indulge him as heretofore, but Don\r\nwanted sugar, and not sermons. Sometimes she nearly gave way, and then\r\ncruel Daisy would intercept the dainty under his very nose, which he\r\nthought most unfeeling.\r\n\r\nHe had a sort of notion that it was all through Daisy that they were\r\njust as stingy and selfish in the kitchen, and that his meals were now\r\nso absurdly few and plain. It was very ungrateful of her, for he had\r\ngone out of his way to be polite and attentive to her. When he thought\r\nof her behaviour to him he felt strongly inclined to sulk, but somehow\r\nhe did not actually go so far as that. He liked Daisy; she was pretty\r\nfor one thing, and Don always preferred pretty people, and then she\r\nstroked him in a very superior and soothing manner. Besides this, he\r\nrespected her: she had been intrusted with the duty of punishing him on\r\nmore than one occasion, and _her_ slaps really hurt, while it was\r\nhopeless to try to soften her heart by trying to lick the chastising\r\nhands--a manoeuvre which was always effective with poor Miss Millikin.\r\nSo he contented himself with letting her see that though he did not\r\nunderstand her conduct towards him, he was willing to overlook it for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n'What a wonderful improvement in the dear dog!' Miss Millikin remarked\r\none morning at breakfast, after Don had been on short commons for a\r\nweek or two. 'Really, Daisy, I begin to think you were quite right about\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I'm _sure_ I was,' said Daisy, who always had great confidence in\r\nher own judgment.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' continued her aunt, 'and, now he's so much better--just this one\r\nsmall bit, Daisy?' Don's eyes already had a green glitter in them and\r\nhis mouth was watering.\r\n\r\n'No, Aunt Sophy,' said Daisy, 'I wouldn't--really. He's better without\r\nanything.'\r\n\r\n'I wish that girl was gone!' reflected poor Don, as he went sulkily back\r\nto his basket. 'It's enough to make a dog steal, upon my tail it is! I'm\r\npositively starved--no bones, no chicken, only beastly dry dog-biscuits\r\nand milk twice a day! I wish I could rummage about in gutters and places\r\nas Jock does--but I don't think the things you find in gutters are ever\r\n_really_ nice. Jock does--but he's just that low sort of dog who\r\n_would_!'\r\n\r\nJock was a humble friend of his down in the village, a sort of distant\r\nrelation to the Dandie Dinmonts; he was a rough, long-backed creature,\r\nas grey as a badger, and with a big solemn head like a hammer. Don was\r\ncivil to him in a patronising way, but he did not tell him of the\r\nindignities he was subject to, perhaps because he had been rather given\r\nto boast of his influence over his mistress, and the high consideration\r\nhe enjoyed at Applethwaite Cottage.\r\n\r\nNow Daisy used to go up for solitary rambles on the fells sometimes,\r\nwhen she generally took Don as a protector. He was becoming very nearly\r\nas active as ever, and now there was a stronger motive than before for\r\npursuing the swallows--for he had a notion that they would be rather\r\ngood eating. But one morning she missed him on her way back through the\r\nvillage by the lake; she was sure he was with her on the pier, and she\r\nhad only stopped to ask some question at the ticket-office about the\r\nsteamboat times; and when she turned round, Don was gone.\r\n\r\nHowever, her aunt was neither angry nor alarmed. Miss Millikin was not\r\nable to walk as much as Don wished, she said, so he was accustomed to\r\ntake a great deal of solitary exercise; he was such a remarkably\r\nintelligent dog that he could be trusted to take care of himself--oh, he\r\nwould come back.\r\n\r\nAnd towards dusk that evening Don did come back. There was a curious air\r\nabout him--subdued, almost sad; Daisy remembered long afterwards how\r\nunusually affectionate he had been, and how quietly he had lain on her\r\nlap till bedtime.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when her aunt and she prepared to go for a walk along\r\nthe lake, Don's excitement was more marked than usual; he leaped up and\r\ntried to caress their hands: he assured them in a thousand ways of the\r\ndelight he felt at being allowed to make one of the party.\r\n\r\nAfter this, it was a painful surprise to find that he gave them the\r\nslip the moment they reached the village. But Miss Millikin said he\r\nalways did prefer mountain scenery, and no doubt it was tiresome for him\r\nto have to potter about as they did. And Master Don began to give them\r\nless and less of his society in the daytime, and to wander from morn to\r\ndewy eve in solitude and independence; though whether he went up\r\nmountains to admire the view, or visited ruins and waterfalls, or spent\r\nhis days hunting rabbits, no one at Applethwaite Cottage could even\r\npretend to guess.\r\n\r\n'_One_ good thing, Aunt Sophy,' said Daisy complacently one evening, a\r\nlittle later, 'I've quite cured Don of being troublesome at meals!'\r\n\r\n'He couldn't be _troublesome_ if he tried, dear,' said Miss Millikin\r\nwith mild reproof; 'but I must say you have succeeded quite\r\nwonderfully--how _did_ you do it?'\r\n\r\n'Why,' said Daisy, 'I spoke to him exactly as if he could understand\r\nevery word, and I made him thoroughly see that he was only wasting his\r\ntime by sitting up and begging for things. And you got to believe it at\r\nlast, didn't you, dear?' she added to Don, who was lying stretched out\r\non the rug.\r\n\r\nDon pricked the ear that was uppermost, and then uttered a heavy sigh,\r\nwhich smote his mistress to the heart.\r\n\r\n'Daisy,' she said, 'it's _no_ use--I _must_ give him something. Poor\r\npet, he deserves it for being so good and patient all this time. One\r\nbiscuit, Daisy?'\r\n\r\nEven Daisy relented: 'Well--a _very_ plain one, then. Let me give it to\r\nhim, auntie?'\r\n\r\nThe biscuit was procured, and Daisy, with an express intimation that\r\nthis was a very particular indulgence, tendered it to the deserving\r\nterrier.\r\n\r\nHe half raised his head, sniffed at it--and then fell back again with\r\nanother weary little sigh. Daisy felt rather crushed. 'I'm afraid he's\r\ncross with me,' she said; 'you try, Aunt Sophy.' Aunt Sophy tried, but\r\nwith no better success, though Don wagged his tail feebly to express\r\nthat he was not actuated by any personal feeling in the matter--he had\r\nno appetite, that was all.\r\n\r\n'Daisy,' said Miss Millikin, with something more like anger than she\r\ngenerally showed, 'I was very wrong to listen to you about the diet.\r\nIt's perfectly plain to me that by checking Don's appetite as we have we\r\nhave done him serious harm. You can see for yourself that he is past\r\neating anything at all now. Cook told me to-day that he had scarcely\r\ntouched his meals lately. And yet he's stouter than ever--_isn't_ he?'\r\n\r\nDaisy was forced to allow that this was so. 'But what can it be?' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n'It's _disease_,' said her aunt, very solemnly. 'I've read over and over\r\nagain that corpulence has nothing whatever to do with the amount of food\r\none eats. And, oh! Daisy, I don't want to blame you, dear--but I'm\r\nafraid we have been depriving him of the nourishing things he really\r\nneeded to enable him to struggle against the complaint!'\r\n\r\nPoor Daisy was overcome by remorse as she knelt over the recumbent Don.\r\n'Oh, darling Don,' she said, 'I didn't mean it--you know I didn't, don't\r\nyou? You must get well and forgive me! I tell you what, aunt,' she said\r\nas she rose to her feet, 'you know you said I might drive you over in\r\nthe pony cart to that tennis-party at the Netherbys to-morrow. Well,\r\nyoung Mr. Netherby is rather a \"doggy\" sort of man, and nice too.\r\nSuppose we take Don with us and ask him to tell us plainly whether he\r\nhas anything dreadful the matter with him?'\r\n\r\nMiss Millikin consented, though she did not pretend to hope much from\r\nMr. Netherby's skill. 'I'm afraid,' she said, with a sigh, 'that only a\r\nvery clever veterinary surgeon would find out what really is the matter\r\nwith Don. But you can try, my dear.'\r\n\r\nThe following afternoon Miss Millikin entrusted herself and Don to\r\nDaisy's driving, not without some nervous misgivings.\r\n\r\n'You're quite sure you can manage him, Daisy?' she said. 'If not, we can\r\ntake John.'\r\n\r\n'Why, Aunt Sophy!' exclaimed Daisy, 'I _always_ drive the children at\r\nhome; and sometimes when I'm on the box with Toppin, he gives me the\r\nreins in a straight part of the road, and Paul and Virginia pull like\r\nanything--Toppin says it's all _he_ can do to hold them.'\r\n\r\nDaisy was a little hurt at the idea that she might find Aunt Sophy's\r\npony too much for her--a sleepy little 'slug of a thing,' as she\r\nprivately called it, which pattered along exactly like a clockwork\r\nanimal in urgent need of winding up.\r\n\r\nDon seemed a little better that day, and was lifted into the pony-cart,\r\nwhere he lay on the indiarubber mat, sniffing the air as if it was doing\r\nhim good.\r\n\r\nDaisy really could drive well for her age, and woke the pony up in a\r\nmanner that astonished her aunt, who remarked from time to time that she\r\nknew Wildfire wanted to walk now--he never could trot long at a\r\ntime--and so they reached the Netherbys' house, which was five miles\r\naway towards the head of the lake, well under the hour, a most\r\nsurprising feat--for Wildfire.\r\n\r\nIt was a grown-up tennis-party, and Daisy, although she had brought her\r\nracket, was a little afraid to play; besides, she wanted to consult\r\nyoung Mr. Netherby about Don, who had been left with the cart in the\r\nstables.\r\n\r\nMr. Netherby, who was a good-natured, red-faced young soldier, just\r\nabout to join his regiment, was not playing either, so Daisy went up to\r\nhim on the first opportunity.\r\n\r\n'You know about dogs, Mr. Netherby, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Rath-er!' said Mr. Netherby, who was a trifle slangy. 'Why? Are you\r\nthinking of investing in a dog?'\r\n\r\n'It's Aunt Sophy's dog,' explained Daisy, 'and he's ill--_very_ ill--and\r\nwe can't make out what's the matter, so I thought you would tell us\r\nperhaps?'\r\n\r\n'I'll ride over to-morrow and have a look at him.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, but you needn't--he's here. Wait--I'll fetch him--don't you come,\r\nplease.'\r\n\r\nAnd presently Daisy made her appearance on the lawn, carrying Don, who\r\nfelt quite a weight, in her arms. She set him down before the young man,\r\nwho examined him in a knowing manner, while Miss Millikin, and some\r\nothers who were not playing just then, gathered round. Don was languid,\r\nbut dignified--he rather liked being the subject of so much notice.\r\nDaisy waited breathlessly for the verdict.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Mr. Netherby, 'it's easy enough to see what's wrong with\r\n_him_. I should knock off his grub.'\r\n\r\n'But,' cried Miss Millikin, 'we _have_ knocked off his grub, as you call\r\nit. The poor dog is starved--literally starved.'\r\n\r\nMr. Netherby said he should scarcely have supposed so from his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n'But I assure you he has eaten nothing--positively nothing--for days and\r\ndays!'\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said Mr. Netherby, 'chameleon, is he? then he's had too much\r\nair--that's all.'\r\n\r\nJust then a young lady who had been brought by some friends living close\r\nby joined the group: 'Why,' she said at once, 'that's the little steamer\r\ndog. How did he come here?'\r\n\r\n'He is _not_ a little steamer dog,' said Miss Millikin in her most\r\ndignified manner; 'he is _my_ dog.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I didn't know,' said the first speaker; 'but--but I'm sure I've\r\nseen him on the steamer several times lately.'\r\n\r\n'I never use the steamers unless I'm absolutely obliged--I disapprove of\r\nthem: it must have been some other dog.'\r\n\r\nThe young lady was positive she had made no mistake. 'You so seldom see\r\na dog with just those markings,' she said, 'and I don't think anybody\r\nwas with him; he came on board at Amblemere and went all round the lake\r\nwith us.'\r\n\r\n'At Amblemere!' cried Daisy, 'that's where _we_ live; and, Aunt Sophy,\r\nyou know Don has been away all day lots of times lately.'\r\n\r\n'What did this dog do on the steamer?' asked Miss Millikin faintly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, he was so sweet! he went round to everybody, and sat up so prettily\r\ntill they gave him biscuits and things--he was everybody's pet; we were\r\nall jealous of one another for the honour of feeding him. The second\r\ntime we brought buns on purpose. But we quite thought he belonged to\r\nthe steamer.'\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Netherby laughed. 'So _that_ is how he took the air! I thought\r\nI wasn't far wrong,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Put him back in the cart, Daisy,' said Miss Millikin severely; 'I can't\r\nbear to look at him.'\r\n\r\nDon did his best to follow this dialogue, but all he could make out was\r\nthat it was about himself, and that he was being as usual exceedingly\r\nadmired. So he sat and looked as good and innocent and interesting as he\r\nknew how. Just then he felt that he would almost rather they did _not_\r\noffer him anything to eat--at least not anything very sweet and rich,\r\nfor he was still not at all well. It was a relief to be back in the cart\r\nand in peace again, though he wondered why Daisy didn't kiss the top of\r\nhis head as she had done several times in carrying him to the lawn. This\r\ntime she held him at a distance, and said nothing but two words, which\r\nsounded suspiciously like 'You _pig_!' as she put him down.\r\n\r\nMiss Millikin was very grave and silent as they drove home. 'I can't\r\ntrust myself to speak about it, Daisy,' she said; 'if--if it was true,\r\nit shows such an utter want of principle--such deceit; and Don used to\r\nbe so honest and straightforward! What if we make inquiries at the pier?\r\nIt--it may be all a mistake.'\r\n\r\nThey stopped for this purpose at Amblemere. 'Ay, Miss Millikin, mum, he\r\ncooms ahn boord reglar, does that wee dug,' said the old boatman, 'and\r\na' makes himsel' rare an' frien'ly, a' do--they coddle him oop fine,\r\namang 'em. Eh, but he's a smart little dug, we quite look for him of a\r\nmorning coomin' for his constitutionil, fur arl the worl' like a\r\nChreestian!'\r\n\r\n'Like a very _greedy_ Christian!' said his disgusted mistress. 'Daisy,'\r\nshe said, when she returned to the pony-cart, 'it's all true! I--I never\r\nhave been so deceived in any one; and the worst of it is, I don't know\r\nhow to punish him, or how to make him feel what a disgraceful trick this\r\nis. Nobody else's dog I ever heard of made his mistress publicly absurd\r\nin this way. It's so--so ungrateful!'\r\n\r\n'Aunt Sophy,' said Daisy, 'I've an idea. Will you leave him to me, and\r\npretend you don't suspect anything? I _will_ cure him this time!'\r\n\r\n'You--you won't want to whip him?' said Miss Millikin, 'because, though\r\nit's all his own doing, he really is not well enough for it just now.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Daisy, 'I won't tell you my plan, auntie, but it's better\r\nthan whipping.'\r\n\r\nAnd all this time the unconscious Don was wearing an expression of\r\nuncomplaining suffering, and looking meekly sorry for himself, with no\r\nsuspicion in the world that he had been found out.\r\n\r\nNext day he felt much better, and as the morning was bright he thought\r\nthat, after all, he might manage another steamer trip; his appetite had\r\ncome back, and his breath was not nearly so short as it had been. He\r\nwas just making modestly for the gate when Daisy stopped him. 'Where are\r\nyou going, sir?' she inquired.\r\n\r\nDon rolled over instantly with all his legs in the air and a feeble\r\napology in his eye.\r\n\r\n'I want you for just one minute first,' said Daisy politely, and carried\r\nhim into the morning-room. Was he going to be whipped?--she couldn't\r\nhave the heart--an invalid like him! He tried to protest by his\r\nwhimpering.\r\n\r\nBut Daisy did nothing of the kind; she merely took something that was\r\nflat and broad and white, and fastened it round his neck with a very\r\nornamental bow and ribbon. Then she opened the French windows, and said\r\nin rather a chilly voice, 'Now run away and get on your nasty steamer\r\nand beg, and see what you get by it!'\r\n\r\nThat seemed, as far as he could tell, very sensible advice, and, oddly\r\nenough, it was exactly what he had been intending to do. It did not\r\nstrike him as particularly strange that Daisy should know, because Don\r\nwas a dog that didn't go very deeply into matters unless he was obliged.\r\n\r\nHe trotted off at an easy pace down to the village, getting hungrier\r\nevery minute, and hoping that the people on the steamer would have\r\nbrought nice things to-day, when, close to the turning that led to the\r\nlanding-stage, he met Jock, and was naturally obliged to stop for a few\r\nmoments' conversation.\r\n\r\nHe was not at all pleased to see him notwithstanding, for I am sorry to\r\nsay that Don's greediness had so grown upon him of late that he was\r\nactually afraid that his humble friend (who was a little slow to find\r\nout when he wasn't wanted) would accompany him on to the steamboat, and\r\nthen of course the good things would have to be divided.\r\n\r\nHowever, Don was a dog that was always scrupulously polite, even to his\r\nfellow-dogs, and he did not like to be rude now.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' said Jock (in dogs' language of course, but I have reason to\r\nbelieve that what follows is as nearly as possible what was actually\r\nsaid). 'What's the matter with you this morning?'\r\n\r\nDon replied that he was rather out of sorts, and was going down to a\r\ncertain lane for a dose of dog-grass.\r\n\r\n'A little dog-grass won't do _me_ any harm,' said Jock; 'I'll come too.'\r\n\r\nThis was awkward, but Don pretended to be glad, and they went a little\r\nway together.\r\n\r\n'But what's that thing round your neck?' asked the Dandie Dinmont.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Don, 'that? It's a bit of finery they put on me at the\r\ncottage. It pleases _them_, you know. Think it's becoming?'\r\n\r\n'Um,' answered Jock; 'reminds me of a thing a friend of mine used to\r\nwear. But _he_ had a blind man tied to him. I don't see _your_ blind\r\nman.'\r\n\r\n'They would have given me a blind man of course if I'd asked for it,'\r\nsaid Don airily, 'but what's the use of a blind man--isn't he rather a\r\nbore?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't ask; but my friend said he believed the thing round his neck,\r\nwhich was flat and white just like yours (only he had a tin mug\r\nunderneath his), made people more inclined to give him things--he didn't\r\nknow why. Do _you_ find that?'\r\n\r\n'How stupid of Daisy to forget the mug!' thought Don. 'I could have\r\nbrought things home to eat quietly then.--I don't know,' he replied to\r\nJock; 'I haven't tried.'\r\n\r\nHe meant to put it to the test very soon, though--if only he could get\r\nrid of Jock.\r\n\r\n'By the way,' he said carelessly, 'have you been round by the hotel\r\nlately?'\r\n\r\n'No,' answered Jock, 'not since the ostler threw a brush at me.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Don, 'there was a bone outside the porch, which, if I\r\nhadn't been feeling so poorly, I should have had a good mind to tackle\r\nmyself. But perhaps some other dog has got hold of it by this time.'\r\n\r\n'I'll soon make him let go if he has!' said Jock, who liked a fight\r\nalmost as well as a bone. '_Where_ was it, did you say?'\r\n\r\n'Outside the hotel. Don't let me keep you. It was a beautiful bone.\r\nGood-morning,' said Don.\r\n\r\nHe did not think it worth while to explain that he had seen it several\r\ndays ago, for Don, as you will have remarked already, was a very artful\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nHe got rid of his unwelcome friend in this highly unprincipled manner,\r\nand strolled on to the pier full of expectation. Steamers ply pretty\r\nfrequently on this particular lake, so he had not to wait very long. The\r\nlittle _Cygnet_ soon came hissing up, and the moment the gangway was\r\nplaced Don stepped on board, with tail proudly erect.\r\n\r\nAs usual, he examined the passengers, first to see who had anything to\r\ngive, then who looked most likely to give it to him. Generally he did\r\nbest with children. He was not fond of children (Daisy was quite an\r\nexception), but he was very fond of cakes, and children, he had\r\nobserved, generally had the best cakes. Don was so accomplished a\r\ncourtier that he would contrive to make every child believe that he or\r\nshe was the only person he loved in the whole world, and he would stay\r\nby his victim until the cake was all gone, and even a little longer,\r\njust for the look of the thing, and then move on to some one else and\r\nbegin again.\r\n\r\nThere were no children with any cakes or buns on board this time,\r\nhowever. There was a stout man up by the bows, dividing his attention\r\nbetween scenery and sandwiches; but Don knew by experience that\r\ntourists' sandwiches are always made with mustard, which he hated. There\r\nwere three merry-looking, round-faced young ladies on a centre bench,\r\neating Osborne biscuits. He wished they could have made it\r\nsponge-cakes, because he was rather tired of Osborne biscuits; but they\r\nwere better than nothing. So to these young ladies he went, and, placing\r\nhimself where he could catch all their eyes at once, he sat up in the\r\nway he had always found irresistible.\r\n\r\nI don't suppose any dog ever found his expectations more cruelly\r\ndisappointed. It was not merely that they shook their heads, they went\r\ninto fits of laughter--they were laughing at him! Don was so deeply\r\noffended that he took himself off at once, and tried an elderly person\r\nwho was munching seed-cake; she did not laugh, but she examined him\r\ncarefully, and then told him with a frown to go away. He began to think\r\nthat Daisy's collar was not a success; he ought to have had a mug, or a\r\nblind man, or both; he did much better when he was left to himself.\r\n\r\nStill he persevered, and went about, wagging his tail and sitting up\r\nappealingly. By and by he began to have an uncomfortable idea that\r\npeople were saying things about him which were not complimentary. He was\r\nalmost sure he heard the word 'greedy,' and he knew what that meant: he\r\nhad been taught by Daisy. They must be talking of some other dog--not\r\nhim; they couldn't possibly know what he was!\r\n\r\nNow Don was undeniably a very intelligent terrier indeed, but there was\r\njust this defect in his education--he could not read: he had no idea\r\nwhat things could be conveyed by innocent-looking little black marks.\r\n'Of course not,' some of my readers will probably exclaim, 'he was only\r\na dog!' But it is not so absurd as it sounds, for one very distinguished\r\nman has succeeded in teaching his dogs to read and even to spell, though\r\nI believe they have not got into very advanced books as yet. Still, it\r\nmay happen some day that all but hopelessly backward or stupid dogs will\r\nbe able to read fluently, and then you may find that your own family dog\r\nhas taken this book into his kennel, and firmly declines to give it up\r\nuntil he has finished it. At present, thank goodness, we have not come\r\nto this, and so there is nothing remarkable in the mere fact that Don\r\nwas unable to read. I only mention it because, if he _had_ possessed\r\nthis accomplishment, he would never have fallen into the trap Daisy had\r\nprepared for him.\r\n\r\nFor the new collar was, as you perhaps guessed long ago, a card, and\r\nupon it was written, in Daisy's neatest and plainest round hand:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am a very Greedy little Dog, and have Plenty to eat at Home,\r\n     So please do not give me anything, or I shall have a Fit and die!\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can easily imagine that, when this unlucky Don sat up and begged,\r\nbearing this inscription written legibly on his unconscious little\r\nchest, the effect was likely to be too much for the gravity of all but\r\nvery stiff and solemn persons.\r\n\r\nNearly everybody on board the steamer was delighted with him; they\r\npointed out the joke to one another, and roared with laughter, until he\r\ngrew quite ashamed to sit up any more. Some teased him by pretending to\r\ngive him something, and then eating it themselves; some seemed almost\r\nsorry for him and petted him; and one, an American, said, 'It was\r\nplaying it too low down to make the little critter give himself away in\r\nthat style!' But nobody quite liked to disobey Daisy's written appeal.\r\n\r\nPoor Don could not understand it in the least; he only saw that every\r\none was very rude and disrespectful to him, and he tried to get away\r\nunder benches. But it was all in vain; people routed him out from his\r\nhiding-places to be introduced to each new comer; he could not go\r\nanywhere without being stared at, and followed, and hemmed in, and\r\nhearing always that same hateful whisper of 'Greedy dog--not to be given\r\nanything,' until he felt exactly as if he was being washed!\r\n\r\nPoor disappointed greedy dog, how gladly he would have given the tail\r\nbetween his legs to be safe at home in the drawing-room with Miss\r\nMillikin and Daisy! How little he had bargained for such a terrible trip\r\nas this!\r\n\r\nI am sure that if Daisy had ever imagined he would feel his disgrace so\r\ndeeply she would not have had the heart to send him out with that\r\ntell-tale card around his neck; but then he would not have received a\r\nvery wholesome lesson, and would certainly have eaten himself into a\r\nserious illness before the summer ended, so perhaps it was all for the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThis time Don did _not_ go the whole round of the lake; he had had\r\nquite enough of it long before the _Cygnet_ reached Highwood, but he did\r\nnot get a chance until they came to Winderside, and then, watching his\r\nopportunity, he gave his tormentors the slip at last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, as Daisy and her aunt sat sketching under the big\r\nholm-oak on the lawn, a dusty little guilty dog stole sneakingly in\r\nunder the garden-gate. It was Don, and he had run all the way from\r\nWinderside, which, though he did not appreciate it, had done him a vast\r\namount of good. 'Oh!' cried Daisy, dropping her paint-brush to clap her\r\nhands gleefully, 'Look, Aunt Sophy, he has had his lesson already!'\r\n\r\nMiss Millikin was inclined to be shocked when she read the ticket. 'It\r\nwas too bad of you, Daisy!' she said; 'I would never have allowed it if\r\nI had known. Come here, Don, and let me take the horrid thing off.'\r\n\r\n'Not yet, please, auntie!' pleaded Daisy, 'I want him to be quite cured,\r\nand it will take at least till bedtime. Then we'll make it up to him.'\r\n\r\nBut Don had understood at last. It was this detestable thing, then, that\r\nhad been telling tales of him and spoiling all his fun! Very well, let\r\nhim find himself alone with it--just once! And he went off very soberly\r\ninto the shrubbery, whence in a few minutes came sounds of 'worrying.'\r\n\r\nIn half an hour Don came out again; his collar was gone, and in his\r\nmouth he trailed a long piece of chewed ribbon, which he dropped with\r\nthe queerest mixture of penitence and reproach at Daisy's feet. After\r\nthat, of course, it was impossible to do anything but take him into\r\nfavour at once, and he was generous enough to let Daisy see that he bore\r\nher no malice for the trick she had played him.\r\n\r\nWhat became of the card no one ever discovered; perhaps Don had buried\r\nit, though Daisy has very strong suspicions that he ate it as his best\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nBut what is more important is that from that day he became a slim and\r\nreformed dog, refusing firmly to go on board a steamer on any pretence\r\nwhatever, and only consenting to sit up after much coaxing, and as a\r\nmark of particular condescension.\r\n\r\nSo that Daisy's experiment, whatever may be thought of it, was at least\r\na successful one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TAKEN BY SURPRISE_\r\n\r\nBEING THE PERSONAL STATEMENT OF BEDELL GRUNCHER, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain misconceptions which a man who is prominently before\r\nthe public is morally bound to combat--more for the sake of others than\r\nhis own--as soon as it becomes probable that the popular estimate of his\r\ncharacter may be shaken, if not shattered, should he hold his peace.\r\nConvinced as I am of this, and having some ground to anticipate that the\r\nnext few days may witness a damaging blow to my personal dignity and\r\ninfluence for good, I have thought it expedient to publish the true\r\nhistory of an episode which, if unexplained, is only too likely to\r\nprejudice me to a serious extent. Any circumstance that tends to\r\nundermine or lessen the world's reverence for its instructors is a\r\ndeplorable calamity, to be averted at all hazards, even when this can\r\nonly be effected by disclosures scarcely less painful to a delicate\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nFor some years I, Bedell Gruncher, have consecrated my poor talents to\r\nthe guidance and education of public taste in questions of art and\r\nliterature. To do this effectively I have laboured--at the cost of some\r\npersonal inconvenience--to acquire a critical style of light and playful\r\nbadinage. My lash has ever been wreathed in ribbons of rare texture and\r\ndaintiest hues; I have thrown cold water in abundance over the nascent\r\nflames of young ambition--but such water was systematically tinctured\r\nwith attar of roses. And in time the articles appearing in various\r\nperiodicals above the signature of 'Vitriol' became, I may acknowledge\r\nwithout false modesty, so many literary events of the first magnitude. I\r\nattribute this to my early recognition of the true function of a critic.\r\nIt is not for him to set up sign-posts, or even warning-boards, for\r\nthose who run and read. To attain true distinction he should erect a\r\npillory upon his study table, and start the fun himself with a choice\r\nselection of the literary analogues of the superannuated eggs and futile\r\nkittens which served as projectiles in the past. The public may be\r\ntrusted to keep it going, and also to retain a grateful recollection of\r\nthe original promoter of the sport. My little weekly and monthly\r\npillories became instantly popular, for all my kittens were well aimed,\r\nand my eggs broke and stuck in a highly entertaining fashion. We are so\r\nconstituted that even the worst of us is capable of a kindly feeling\r\ntowards the benefactor who makes others imperishably ridiculous in our\r\neyes; and to do this was my _métier à moi_. At first my identity with\r\nthe lively but terrible 'Vitriol' was kept a profound secret, but\r\ngradually, by some means which I do not at present remember, it leaked\r\nout, and I immediately became a social, as well as a literary,\r\ncelebrity. Physically I have been endowed with a presence which, though\r\nnot of unusual height and somewhat inclined to central expansion,\r\nproduces, I find, an invariably imposing effect, especially with members\r\nof the more emotional and impressionable sex. Consequently I was not\r\nsurprised even at the really extraordinary sensation I inspired upon my\r\nfirst introduction to a very charming young lady, Miss Iris Waverley, as\r\nsoon as my _nom de guerre_ was (I forget just now by whom) incidentally\r\nalluded to. However, as it turned out, she had another and a deeper\r\nreason for emotion: it seemed she had been engaged to a young poet whose\r\nverses, to her untaught and girlish judgment, seemed inspired by\r\ndraughts of the true Helicon, and whose rhythmical raptures had stirred\r\nher maiden heart to its depths.\r\n\r\nWell, that young poet's latest volume of verse came under my notice for\r\nreview, and in my customary light-hearted fashion I held it up to\r\ngeneral derision for a column or two, and then dismissed it, with an\r\nineffaceable epigrammatic kick, to spin for ever (approximately) down\r\nthe ringing grooves of criticism.\r\n\r\nMiss Waverley, it happened, was inclined to correct her own views by the\r\nopinions of others, and was, moreover, exceptionally sensitive to any\r\nassociation of ridicule with the objects of her attachment--indeed, she\r\nonce despatched a dog she fondly loved to the lethal chamber at\r\nBattersea, merely because all the hair had come off the poor animal's\r\ntail! My trenchant sarcasms had depoetised her lover in a similar\r\nfashion; their livid lightning had revealed the baldness, the glaring\r\nabsurdity of the very stanzas which once had filled her eyes with\r\ndelicious tears; he was dismissed, and soon disappeared altogether from\r\nthe circles which I had (in perfect innocence) rendered impossible to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, Miss Waverley's first sentiments towards me were\r\nscarcely, oddly enough, of unmixed gratitude. I represented the rod, and\r\na very commendable feeling of propriety made her unwilling to kiss me on\r\na first interview, though, as our intimacy advanced--well, there are\r\nsubjects on which I claim the privilege of a manly reticence.\r\n\r\nI hasten over, then, the intermediate stages of antipathy, fear,\r\nrespect, interest, and adoration. In me she recognised an intellect\r\nnaturally superior, too indifferent and unambitious to give life to its\r\nown imaginings--too honest, too devoted to humanity, to withhold merited\r\ncondemnation from those of others. I was the radiant sun whose scorching\r\nbeams melted the wax from the pinions of many a modern Icarus; or, to\r\nput the metaphor less ingeniously, the shining light in which, by an\r\nirresistible impulse of self-destruction, the poetical and artistic\r\nmoths flew and incontinently frizzled.\r\n\r\nOne trait in my character which Iris valued above all others was the\r\ncaution with which I habitually avoided all associations of a ridiculous\r\nnature; for it was my pride to preserve a demeanour of unsullied dignity\r\nunder circumstances which would have been trying, if not fatal, to an\r\nordinary person. So we became engaged; and if, pecuniarily speaking, the\r\nadvantage of the union inclined to my side, I cannot consider that I was\r\nthe party most benefited by the transaction.\r\n\r\nIt was soon after this happy event that Iris entreated from me, as a\r\ngift, a photograph of myself. I could not help being struck by this\r\ninstance of feminine parsimony with regard to small disbursements,\r\nsince, for the trifling sum of one shilling, it was perfectly open to\r\nher to procure an admirable presentment of me at almost any stationer's;\r\nfor, in obedience to a widely expressed demand, I had already more than\r\nonce undergone the ordeal by camera.\r\n\r\nBut no; she professed to desire a portrait more peculiarly her own--one\r\nthat should mark the precise epoch of our mutual happiness--a caprice\r\nwhich reminded me of the Salvation Army recruit who was photographed, by\r\ndesire, 'before and after conversion'; and I demurred a little, until\r\nIris insisted with such captivating pertinacity that--although my\r\npersonal expenses (always slightly in excess of my income) had been\r\nfurther swelled since my engagement by the innumerable _petits soins_\r\nexpected by an absurd custom from every lover--I gave way at length.\r\n\r\nIt was her desire that my portrait should form a pendant to one of\r\nherself which had been recently taken by a fashionable photographer, and\r\nI promised to see that this wish should be gratified. It is possible\r\nthat she expected me to resort to the same artist; but there were\r\nconsiderations which induced me to avoid this, if I could. To the extent\r\nof a guinea (or even thirty shillings) I could refuse her nothing; but\r\nevery one knows what sums are demanded by a photographer who is at all\r\nin vogue. I might, to be sure, as a public character, have sat without\r\nbeing called upon for any consideration, beyond the right to dispose of\r\ncopies of my photograph; but I felt that Iris would be a little hurt if\r\nI took this course, and none of the West-end people whom I consulted in\r\nthe matter quite saw their way to such an arrangement just then. There\r\nwas a temporary lull, they assured me, in the demand for likenesses of\r\nour leading literary men, and I myself had been photographed within too\r\nrecent a period to form any exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nSo, keeping my promise constantly in mind, I never entered a secluded\r\nneighbourhood without being on the look-out for some unpretending\r\nphotographic studio which would combine artistic excellence with\r\nmoderate charges.\r\n\r\nAnd at last I discovered this photographic phoenix, whose nest, if I\r\nmay so term it, was in a retired suburb which I do not care to\r\nparticularise. Upon the street level was a handsome plate-glass window,\r\nin which, against a background of dark purple hangings and potted ferns,\r\nwere displayed cartes, cabinets, and groups, in which not even my\r\ntrained faculties could detect the least inferiority to the more costly\r\nproductions of the West-end, while the list of prices that hung by the\r\ndoor was conceived in a spirit of exemplary modesty. After a brief\r\nperiod of hesitation I stepped inside, and, on stating my wish to be\r\nphotographed at once, was invited by a very civil youth with a slight\r\ncast in his eye to walk upstairs, which I accordingly did.\r\n\r\nI mounted flight after flight of stairs, till I eventually found myself\r\nat the top of the house, in an apartment pervaded by a strong odour of\r\nchemicals, and glazed along the roof and the whole of one side with\r\npanes of a bluish tint. It was empty at the moment of my entrance, but,\r\nafter a few minutes, the photographer burst impetuously in--a tall young\r\nman, with long hair and pale eyes, whose appearance denoted a nervous\r\nand high-strung temperament. Perceiving him to be slightly overawed by a\r\ncertain unconscious dignity in my bearing, which frequently does produce\r\nthat effect upon strangers, I hastened to reassure him by discriminating\r\neulogies upon the specimens of his art that I had been inspecting\r\nbelow, and I saw at once that he was readily susceptible to flattery.\r\n\r\n'You will find me,' I told him frankly, 'a little more difficult to\r\nsatisfy than your ordinary _clientèle_; but, on the other hand, I am\r\npeculiarly capable of appreciating really good work. Now I was struck at\r\nonce by the delicacy of tone, the nice discrimination of values, the\r\natmosphere, gradation, feeling, and surface of the examples displayed in\r\nyour window.'\r\n\r\nHe bowed almost to the ground; but, having taken careful note of his\r\nprices, I felt secure in commending him, even to the verge of\r\nextravagance; and, besides, does not the artistic nature demand the\r\nstimulus of praise to enable it to put forth its full powers?\r\n\r\nHe inquired in what style I wished to be taken, whether full-length,\r\nhalf-length, or vignette. 'I will answer you as concisely as possible,'\r\nI said. 'I have been pressed, by one whose least preference is a law to\r\nme, to have a photograph of myself executed which shall form a\r\ncounterpart or pendant, as it were, to her own. I have, therefore, taken\r\nthe precaution to bring her portrait with me for your guidance. You will\r\nobserve it is the work of a firm in my opinion greatly\r\noverrated--Messrs. Lenz, Kamerer, & Co.; and, while you will follow it\r\nin style and the disposition of the accessories, you will, I make no\r\ndoubt, produce, if you take ordinary pains, a picture vastly superior in\r\nartistic merit.'\r\n\r\nThis, as will be perceived, was skilfully designed to put him on his\r\nmettle, and rouse a useful spirit of emulation. He took the portrait of\r\nIris from my hands and carried it to the light, where he examined it\r\ngravely in silence.\r\n\r\n'I presume,' he said at length, 'that I need hardly tell you I cannot\r\npledge myself to produce a result as pleasing as this--under the\r\ncircumstances?'\r\n\r\n'That,' I replied, 'rests entirely with you. If you overcome your\r\nnatural diffidence, and do yourself full justice, _I_ see no reason why\r\nyou should not obtain something even more satisfactory.'\r\n\r\nMy encouragement almost unmanned him. He turned abruptly away and blew\r\nhis nose violently with a coloured silk handkerchief.\r\n\r\n'Come, come,' I said, smiling kindly, 'you see I have every confidence\r\nin you--let us begin. I don't know, by the way,' I added, with a sudden\r\nafterthought, 'whether in your leisure moments you take any interest in\r\ncontemporary literature?'\r\n\r\n'I--I have done so in my time,' he admitted; 'not very lately.'\r\n\r\n'Then,' I continued, watching his countenance with secret amusement for\r\nthe spasm I find this announcement invariably produces upon persons of\r\nany education, 'it may possibly call up some associations in your mind\r\nif I tell you that I am perhaps better known by my self-conferred\r\n_sobriquet_ of \"Vitriol.\"'\r\n\r\nEvidently I had to do with a man of some intelligence--I obtained an\r\neven more electrical effect than usual. '\"_Vitriol!_\"' he cried, '_not_\r\nsurely Vitriol, the great critic?'\r\n\r\n'The same,' I said carelessly. 'I thought I had better mention it.'\r\n\r\n'You did well,' he rejoined, 'very well! Pardon my emotion--may I wring\r\nthat hand?'\r\n\r\nIt is not my practice to shake hands with a photographer, but I was\r\ntouched and gratified by his boyish enthusiasm, and he seemed a\r\ngentlemanly young fellow too, so I made an exception in his favour; and\r\nhe did wring my hand--hard.\r\n\r\n'So you are Vitriol?' he repeated in a kind of daze, 'and you have\r\nsought me out--_me_, of all people in the world--to have the honour of\r\ntaking your photograph!'\r\n\r\n'That is so,' I said, 'but pardon me if I warn you that you must not\r\nallow your head to be turned by what is, in truth, due to the merest\r\naccident.'\r\n\r\n'But what an accident!' he cried; 'after what I have learnt I really\r\ncould not think of making any charge for this privilege!'\r\n\r\nThat was a creditable and not unnatural impulse, and I did not check it.\r\n'You shall take me as often as you please,' I said, 'and for nothing.'\r\n\r\n'And may I,' he said, a little timidly--'would you give me permission to\r\nexhibit the results?'\r\n\r\n'If I followed my own inclinations,' I replied, 'I should answer\r\n\"certainly not.\" But perhaps I have no right to deprive you of the\r\nadvertisement, and still less to withhold my unworthy features from\r\npublic comment. I may, for private reasons,' I added, thinking of Iris,\r\n'find it advisable to make some show of displeasure, but you need not\r\nfear my taking any proceedings to restrain you.'\r\n\r\n'We struggling photographers must be so careful,' he sighed. 'Suppose\r\nthe case of your lamented demise--it would be a protection if I had some\r\nwritten authority under your hand to show your legal representatives.'\r\n\r\n'_Actio personalis moritur cum personâ_,' I replied; 'if my executors\r\nbrought an action, they would find themselves non-suited.' (I had\r\nstudied for the Bar at one period of my life.)\r\n\r\n'Quite so,' he said, 'but they might drag me into court, nevertheless. I\r\nshould really prefer to be on the safe side.'\r\n\r\nIt did not seem unreasonable, particularly as I had not the remotest\r\nintention either of bringing an action or dying; so I wrote him a hasty\r\nmemorandum to the effect that, in consideration of his photographing me\r\nfree of charge (I took care to put _that_ in), I undertook to hold him\r\nfree from all molestation or hindrance whatever in respect of the sale\r\nand circulation of all copies resulting from such photographing as\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\n'Will that do?' I said as I handed it to him.\r\n\r\nHis eyes gleamed as he took the document. 'It is just what I wanted,'\r\nhe said gratefully; 'and now, if you will excuse me, I will go and bring\r\nin a few accessories, and then we will get to work.'\r\n\r\nHe withdrew in a state of positive exultation, leaving me to\r\ncongratulate myself upon the happy chance which had led me to his door.\r\nOne does not discover a true artist every day, capable of approaching\r\nhis task in a proper spirit of reverence and enthusiasm; and I had\r\nhardly expected, after my previous failures, to be spared all personal\r\noutlay. My sole regret, indeed, was that I had not stipulated for a\r\nshare in the profits arising from the sale--which would be doubtless a\r\nlarge one; but meanness is not one of my vices, and I decided not to\r\npress this point.\r\n\r\nPresently he returned with something which bulged inside his velvet\r\njacket, and a heap of things which he threw down in a corner behind a\r\nscreen.\r\n\r\n'A few little properties,' he said; 'we may be able to introduce them\r\nby-and-by.'\r\n\r\nThen he went to the door and, with a rapid action, turned the key and\r\nplaced it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n'You will hardly believe,' he explained, 'how nervous I am on occasions\r\nof importance like this; the bare possibility of interruption would\r\nrender me quite incapable of doing myself justice.'\r\n\r\nI had never met any photographer quite so sensitive as that before, and\r\nI began to be uneasy about his success; but I know what the artistic\r\ntemperament is, and, as he said, this was not like an ordinary\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n'Before I proceed to business,' he said, in a voice that positively\r\ntrembled, 'I must tell you what an exceptional claim you have to my\r\nundying gratitude. Amongst the many productions which you have visited\r\nwith your salutary satire you may possibly recall a little volume of\r\npoems entitled \"Pants of Passion\"?'\r\n\r\nI shook my head good-humouredly. 'My good friend,' I told him, 'if I\r\nburdened my memory with all the stuff I have to pronounce sentence upon,\r\ndo you suppose my brain would be what it is?'\r\n\r\nHe looked crestfallen. 'No,' he said slowly, 'I ought to have known--you\r\nwould not remember, of course. But _I_ do. I brought out those Pants.\r\nYour mordant pen tore them to tatters. You convinced me that I had\r\nmistaken my career, and, thanks to your monitions, I ceased to practise\r\nas a Poet, and became the Photographer you now behold!'\r\n\r\n'And I have known poets,' I said encouragingly, 'who have ended far less\r\ncreditably. For even an indifferent photographer is in closer harmony\r\nwith nature than a mediocre poet.'\r\n\r\n'And I _was_ mediocre, wasn't I?' he inquired humbly.\r\n\r\n'So far as I recollect,' I replied (for I did begin to remember him\r\nnow), 'to attribute mediocrity to you would have been beyond the\r\naudacity of the grossest sycophant.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' he said; 'you little know how you encourage me in my\r\npresent undertaking--for you will admit that I can _photograph_?'\r\n\r\n'That,' I replied, 'is intelligible enough, photography being a pursuit\r\ndemanding less mental ability in its votaries than that of metrical\r\ncomposition, however halting.'\r\n\r\n'There is something very soothing about your conversation,' he remarked;\r\n'it heals my self-love--which really was wounded by the things you\r\nwrote.'\r\n\r\n'Pooh, pooh!' I said indulgently, 'we must all of us go through that in\r\nour time--at least all of _you_ must go through it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he admitted sadly, 'but it ain't pleasant, is it?'\r\n\r\n'Of that I have never been in a position to judge,' said I; 'but you\r\nmust remember that your sufferings, though doubtless painful to\r\nyourself, are the cause, under capable treatment, of infinite pleasure\r\nand amusement to others. Try to look at the thing without egotism. Shall\r\nI seat myself on that chair I see over there?'\r\n\r\nHe was eyeing me in a curious manner. 'Allow me,' he said; 'I always\r\npose my sitters myself.' With that he seized me by the neck and\r\nelsewhere without the slightest warning, and, carrying me to the further\r\nend of the studio, flung me carelessly, face downwards, over the\r\ncane-bottomed chair to which I had referred. He was a strong athletic\r\nyoung man, in spite of his long hair--or might that have been, as in\r\nSamson's case, a contributory cause? I was like an infant in his hands,\r\nand lay across the chair, in an exceedingly uncomfortable position,\r\ngasping for breath.\r\n\r\n'Try to keep as limp as you can, please,' he said, 'the mouth wide open,\r\nas you have it now, the legs careless--in fact, trailing. Beautiful!\r\ndon't move.'\r\n\r\nAnd he went to the camera. I succeeded in partly twisting my head round.\r\n'Are you _mad_?' I cried indignantly; 'do you really suppose I shall\r\nconsent to go down to posterity in such a position as this?'\r\n\r\nI heard a click, and, to my unspeakable horror, saw that he was\r\ndeliberately covering me from behind the camera with a revolver--_that_\r\nwas what I had seen bulging inside his pocket.\r\n\r\n'I should be sorry to slay any sitter in cold blood,' he said, 'but I\r\nmust tell you solemnly, that unless you instantly resume your original\r\npose--which was charming--you are a dead man!'\r\n\r\nNot till then did I realise the awful truth--I was locked up alone, at\r\nthe top of a house, in a quiet neighbourhood, with a mad photographer!\r\nSummoning to my aid all my presence of mind, I resumed the original pose\r\nfor the space of forty-five hours--they were seconds really, but they\r\n_seemed_ hours; it was not needful for him to exhort me to be limp\r\nagain--I was limper than the dampest towel!\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much,' he said gravely as he covered the lens; 'I think\r\nthat will come out very well indeed. You may move now.'\r\n\r\nI rose, puffing, but perfectly collected. 'Ha-ha,' I laughed in a sickly\r\nmanner (for I _felt_ sick), 'I--I perceive, sir, that you are a\r\nhumorist.'\r\n\r\n'Since I have abandoned poetry,' he said as he carefully removed the\r\nnegative to a dark place, 'I have developed a considerable sense of\r\nquiet humour. You will find a large Gainsborough hat in that\r\ncorner--might I trouble you to put it on for the next sitting?'\r\n\r\n'Never!' I cried, thoroughly revolted. 'Surely, with your rare artistic\r\nperception, you must be aware that such a headdress as that (which is no\r\nlonger worn even by females) is out of all keeping with my physiognomy.\r\nI will _not_ sit for my photograph in such a preposterous thing!'\r\n\r\n'I shall count ten very slowly,' he replied pensively, 'and if by the\r\ntime I have finished you are not seated on the back of that chair, your\r\nfeet crossed so as to overlap, your right thumb in the corner of your\r\nmouth, a pleasant smile on your countenance, _and_ the Gainsborough hat\r\non your head, you will need no more hats on this sorrowful earth.\r\nOne--two----'\r\n\r\nI was perched on that chair in the prescribed attitude long before he\r\nhad got to seven! How can I describe what it cost me to smile, as I sat\r\nthere under the dry blue light, the perspiration rolling in beads down\r\nmy cheeks, exposed to the gleaming muzzle of the revolver, and the\r\nsteady Gorgon glare of that infernal camera?\r\n\r\n'That will be extremely popular,' he said, lowering the weapon as he\r\nconcluded. 'Your smile, perhaps, was a _little_ too broad, but the pose\r\nwas very fresh and unstudied.'\r\n\r\nI have always read of the controlling power of the human eye upon wild\r\nbeasts and dangerous maniacs, and I fixed mine firmly upon him now as I\r\nsaid sternly, 'Let me out at once--I wish to go.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps I did not fix them quite long enough; perhaps the power of the\r\nhuman eye has been exaggerated: I only know that for all the effect mine\r\nhad on him they might have been oysters.\r\n\r\n'Not yet,' he said persuasively, 'not when we're getting on so nicely. I\r\nmay never be able to take you under such favourable conditions again.'\r\n\r\nThat, I thought, I could undertake to answer for; but who, alas! could\r\nsay whether I should ever leave that studio alive? For all I knew, he\r\nmight spend the whole day in photographing me, and then, with a madman's\r\ncaprice, shoot me as soon as it became too dark to go on any longer! The\r\nproper course to take, I knew, was to humour him, to keep him in a good\r\ntemper, fool him to the top of his bent--it was my only chance.\r\n\r\n'Well,' I said, 'perhaps you're right. I--I'm in no great hurry. Were\r\nyou thinking of taking me in some different style? I am quite at your\r\ndisposition.'\r\n\r\nHe brought out a small but stout property-mast, and arranged it against\r\na canvas background of coast scenery. 'I generally use it for children\r\nin sailor costume,' he said, 'but I _think_ it will bear your weight\r\nlong enough for the purpose.'\r\n\r\nI wiped my brow. 'You are not going to ask me to climb that thing?' I\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he suggested, 'if you will just arrange yourself upon the\r\ncross-trees in a negligent attitude, upside down, with your tongue\r\nprotruded as if for medical inspection, I shall be perfectly satisfied.'\r\n\r\nI tried argument. 'I should have no objection in the world,' I said;\r\n'it's an excellent idea--only, _do_ sailors ever climb masts in that\r\nway? Wouldn't it be better to have the thing correct while we're about\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n'I was not aware that you were a sailor,' he said; '_are_ you?'\r\n\r\nI was afraid to say I was, because I apprehended that, if I did, it\r\nmight occur to him to put me through some still more frightful\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n'Come,' he said, 'you won't compel me to shed blood so early in the\r\nafternoon, will you? Up with you.'\r\n\r\nI got up, but, as I hung there, I tried to obtain a modification of\r\nsome of the details. 'I don't think,' I said artfully, 'that I'll put\r\nout my tongue--it's rather overdone, eh? _Everybody_ is taken with his\r\ntongue out nowadays.'\r\n\r\n'It is true,' he said, 'but I am not well enough known in the profession\r\nyet to depart entirely from the conventional. Your tongue out as far as\r\nit will go, please.'\r\n\r\n'I shall have a rush of blood to the head, I know I shall,' I protested.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said; 'am I taking this photograph, or are you?'\r\n\r\nThere was no possible doubt, unfortunately, as to who was taking the\r\nphotograph. I made one last remonstrance. 'I put it to you as a sensible\r\nman,' I began; but it is a waste of time to put anything to a raving\r\nlunatic as a sensible man. It is enough to say that he carried his\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n'I wish you could see the negative!' he said as he came back from his\r\nlaboratory. 'You were a little red in the face, but it will come out\r\nblack, so it's all right. That carte will be quite a novelty, I flatter\r\nmyself.'\r\n\r\nI groaned. However, this was the end; I would get away now at all\r\nhazards, and tell the police that there was a dangerous maniac at large.\r\nI got down from the mast with affected briskness. 'Well,' I said, 'I\r\nmustn't take advantage of your good nature any longer. I'm exceedingly\r\nobliged to you for the--the pains you have taken. You will send _all_\r\nthe photographs to this address, please?'\r\n\r\n'Don't go yet,' he said. 'Are you an equestrian, by the way?'\r\n\r\nIf I could only engage him in conversation I felt comparatively secure.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I put in an appearance in the Row sometimes, in the season,' I\r\nreplied; 'and, while I think of it,' I added, with what I thought at the\r\ntime was an inspiration, 'if you will come with me now, I'll show you my\r\nhorse--you might take me on horseback, eh?' I did not possess any such\r\nanimal, but I wanted to have that door unlocked.\r\n\r\n'Take you on horseback?' he repeated. 'That's a good idea--I had rather\r\nthought of that myself.'\r\n\r\n'Then come along and bring your instrument,' I said, 'and you can take\r\nme at the stables; they're close by.'\r\n\r\n'No need for that,' he replied cheerfully. 'I'll find you a mount here.'\r\n\r\nAnd the wretched lunatic went behind the screen and wheeled out a small\r\nwooden quadruped covered with large round spots!\r\n\r\n'She's a strawberry roan,' he said; 'observe the strawberries. So, my\r\nbeauty, quiet, then! Now settle yourself easily in the saddle, as if you\r\nwere in the Row, with your face to the tail.'\r\n\r\n'Listen to me for one moment,' I entreated tremulously. 'I assure you\r\nthat I am not in the habit of appearing in Rotten Row on a spotted\r\nwooden horse, nor does any one, I assure you--_any_ one mount a horse of\r\nany description with his face towards the crupper! If you take me like\r\nthat, you will betray your ignorance--you will be laughed at!'\r\n\r\nWhen people tell you it is possible to hoodwink the insane by any\r\nspecious show of argument, don't believe them; my own experience is that\r\ndemented persons can be quite perversely logical when it suits their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n'Pardon me,' he said, '_you_ will be laughed at possibly--not I. I\r\ncannot be held responsible for the caprices of my clients. Mount,\r\nplease; she'll carry you perfectly.'\r\n\r\n'I will,' I said, 'if you'll give me the revolver to hold. I--I should\r\nlike to be done with a revolver.'\r\n\r\n'I shall be delighted to do you with a revolver,' he said grimly, 'but\r\nnot yet; and if I lent you the weapon now, I could not answer for your\r\nbeing able to hold the horse as well--she has never been broken in to\r\nfirearms. _I'll_ hold the revolver. One--two--three.'\r\n\r\nI mounted; why had I not disregarded the expense and gone to Lenz and\r\nKamerer? Lenz does not pose his customers by the aid of a revolver.\r\nKamerer, I was sure, would not put his patrons through these degrading\r\ntomfooleries.\r\n\r\nHe took more trouble over this than any of the others; I was\r\nphotographed from the back, in front, and in profile; and if I escaped\r\nbeing made to appear abjectly ridiculous, it can only be owing to the\r\ntragic earnestness which the consciousness of my awful situation lent to\r\nmy expression.\r\n\r\nAs he took the last I rolled off the horse, completely prostrated. 'I\r\nthink,' I gasped faintly, 'I would rather be shot at once--_without_\r\nwaiting to be taken in any other positions. I really am not equal to any\r\nmore of this!' (He was quite capable, I felt, of photographing me in a\r\nperambulator, if it once occurred to him!)\r\n\r\n'Compose yourself,' he said soothingly, 'I have obtained all I wanted. I\r\nshall not detain you much longer. Your life, I may remark, was never in\r\nany imminent danger, as this revolver is unloaded. I have now only to\r\nthank you for the readiness with which you have afforded me your\r\nco-operation, and to assure you that early copies of each of the\r\nphotographs shall be forwarded for Miss Waverley's inspection.'\r\n\r\n'Miss Waverley!' I exclaimed; 'stay, how do _you_ know that name?'\r\n\r\n'If I mistake not, it was her photograph that you kindly brought for my\r\nguidance. I ought to have mentioned, perhaps, that I once had the honour\r\nof being engaged to her--until you (no doubt from the highest motives)\r\ninvested my little gift of song with a flavour of unromantic ridicule.\r\nThat ridicule I am now enabled to repay, with interest calculated up to\r\nthe present date.'\r\n\r\n'So you are Iris's poet!' I burst out, for, somehow, I had not\r\ncompletely identified him till that moment. 'You scoundrel! do you think\r\nI shall allow you to circulate those atrocious caricatures with\r\nimpunity? No, by heavens! my solicitor shall----'\r\n\r\n'I rely upon the document you were kind enough to furnish,' he said\r\nquietly. 'I fear that any legal proceedings you may resort to will\r\nhardly avert the publicity you seem to fear. Allow me to unfasten the\r\ndoor. Good-bye; mind the step on the first landing. Might I beg you to\r\nrecommend me amongst your friends?'\r\n\r\nI went out without another word; he was mad, of course, or he would not\r\nhave devised so outrageous a revenge for a fancied injury, but he was\r\ncunning enough to be my match. I knew too well that if I took any legal\r\nmeasures, he would contrive to shift the whole burden of lunacy upon\r\n_me_. I dared not court an inquiry for many reasons, and so I was\r\ncompelled to pass over this unparalleled outrage in silence.\r\n\r\nIris made frequent inquiries after the promised photograph, and I had to\r\nparry them as well as I could--which was a mistake in judgment on my\r\npart, for one afternoon while I was actually sitting with her, a packet\r\narrived addressed to Miss Waverley.\r\n\r\nI did not suspect what it might contain until it was too late. She\r\nrecognised that photographs were inside the wrappings, which she tore\r\nopen with a cry of rapture--and then!\r\n\r\nShe had a short fainting fit when she saw the Gainsborough hat, and as\r\nsoon as she revived, the extraordinary appearance I presented upside\r\ndown on the mast sent her into violent hysterics. By the time she was in\r\na condition to look at the equestrian portraits she had grown cold and\r\nhard as marble. 'Go,' she said, indicating the door, 'I see I have been\r\nwasting my affection upon a vulgar and heartless buffoon!'\r\n\r\nI went--for she would listen to no explanations; and indeed I doubt\r\nwhether, even were she to come upon this statement, it would serve to\r\nrestore my tarnished ideal in her estimation. But, though I have lost\r\nher, I am naturally anxious (as I said when I began) that the public\r\nshould not be misled into drawing harsh conclusions from what, if left\r\nunexplained, may doubtless have a singular appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, up to the present, I have not been able to learn that\r\nany of those fatal portraits have absolutely been exposed for sale,\r\nthough I direct my trembling steps almost every day to Regent Street,\r\nand search the windows of the Stereoscopic Company with furtive and\r\nforeboding eyes, dreading to be confronted with presentments of\r\nmyself--Bedell Gruncher, 'Vitriol,' the great critic!--lying across a\r\nchair in a state of collapse, sucking my thumb in a Gainsborough hat,\r\nor bestriding a ridiculous wooden horse with my face towards its tail!\r\n\r\nBut they cannot be long in coming out now; and my one hope is that these\r\nlines may appear in print in time to forestall the prejudice and scandal\r\nwhich are otherwise inevitable. At all events, now that the world is in\r\npossession of the real facts, I am entitled to hope that the treatment\r\nto which I have been subjected will excite the indignation and sympathy\r\nit deserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PALEFACE AND REDSKIN_\r\n\r\nA COMEDY-STORY FOR GIRLS AND BOYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THE FIRST\r\n\r\nWHERE IS THE ENEMY?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a very hot afternoon, and Hazel, Hilary, and Cecily Jolliffe were\r\nsitting under the big cedar on the lawn at The Gables. Each had her\r\nracket by her side, and the tennis-court lay, smooth and inviting, close\r\nby; but they did not seem inclined to play just then, and there was\r\nsomething in the expression of all three which indicated a common\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Hazel, the eldest, who was nearly fourteen, 'we need not\r\nhave excited ourselves about the boys' holidays, if we had only known.\r\nThey don't give us much of their society--why, we haven't had one single\r\ngame of cricket together yet!'\r\n\r\n'And then to have the impudence to tell us that they didn't care much\r\nabout _our_ sort of cricket!' said Hilary, 'when I can throw up every\r\nbit as far as Jack, and it takes Guy three overs to bowl me! It's\r\nbeastly cheek of them.'\r\n\r\n'_Hilary!_' cried Cecily, 'what would mother say if she heard you talk\r\nlike that?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's the holidays!' said Hilary, lazily. 'Besides, it is a shame!\r\nThey would have played with us just as they used to, if it hadn't been\r\nfor that Clarence Tinling.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' Hazel agreed, 'he hates cricket. I do believe that's the reason\r\nwhy he invented this silly army, and talked Jack and Guy into giving up\r\neverything for it.'\r\n\r\n'They haven't any will of their own, poor things!' said Hilary.\r\n\r\n'You forget, Hilary,' put in Cecily, 'Tinling is the guest. They ought\r\nto give way to him.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Hilary, 'it's ridiculous for great boys who have been two\r\nterms at school to go marching about with swords and guns. Big babies!'\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was a little personal feeling at the bottom of this, for\r\nshe had offered herself for enlistment, and had been sternly rejected on\r\nthe ground of her sex.\r\n\r\n'I wish he would go, I know that,' said Hazel, making a rather vicious\r\nlittle chop at her shoe with her racket; 'those boys talk about nothing\r\nbut their stupid army from morning to night. Uncle Lambert says they\r\nmake him feel quite gunpowdery at lunch. And what do you think is the\r\nlast thing they've done?--put up a great fence all round their tent, and\r\nshut themselves up there all day!'\r\n\r\n'Except when they're sentries and hide,' put in Hilary; 'they're always\r\njumping up somewhere and wanting you to give the countersign. It isn't\r\nlike home, these holidays!'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' suggested Cecily, 'it makes things safer, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Duffer, Cis!' cried Hilary, contemptuously, for Cecily had appointed\r\nherself professional peacemaker to the family, and her efforts were\r\nabout as successful as such domestic offices ever are.\r\n\r\n'Look out!' cried Hilary, presently; 'they're coming. Don't let's take\r\nthe least notice of them. They hate that more than anything.'\r\n\r\nFrom the shrubbery filed three boys, the first and tallest of whom wore\r\nan imposing dragoon's helmet with a crimson plume, and carried a\r\nsabretache and crossbelts, and wore red caps like those of the French\r\narmy; they carried guns on their shoulders.\r\n\r\n'Halt! 'Tention! Dis-miss!' shouted the commanding officer, and the army\r\nbroke off with admirable precision.\r\n\r\n'Don't be alarmed,' said the General considerately to the three girls;\r\n'the army is only out on fatigue duty.'\r\n\r\n'Then wouldn't the army like to sit down?' suggested Hilary, forgetting\r\nall about her recent proposal.\r\n\r\n'Ah, you don't understand,' said General Tinling with some pity. 'It's\r\na military term.'\r\n\r\nHe was a pale, puffy boy, with reddish hair and freckles, who was\r\nevidently fully alive to the dignity of his position.\r\n\r\n'Suppose we let military things alone for a little while,' said Hazel.\r\n'We want the army to come and play tennis. You will, won't you, Jack and\r\nGuy? and Cis will umpire--she likes it.'\r\n\r\n'I don't mind a game,' said Jack.\r\n\r\n'I'll play, if you like,' added Guy; but he had forgotten that the\r\nGeneral was a bit of a martinet.\r\n\r\n'That's nice discipline,' he said. 'I don't know whether you know it;\r\nbut in some armies you'd be court-martialled for less than that.'\r\n\r\n'Well, may we, then?' asked Guy a little impatiently.\r\n\r\n'No salute now!' cried his superior. 'I shall never make you fellows\r\nsmart. Why, at the Haversacks, last Easter, there were half a dozen of\r\nus, and we drilled like machines. Of course you mayn't play tennis--this\r\nis only a bivouac; and it's over now. Attention! The left wing of the\r\nforce will occupy the shrubbery; the right will push on and blow up the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n'Which of us is the left wing?' inquired Guy.\r\n\r\n'You are, of course.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right; only you said Jack was just now,' grumbled Guy, who was\r\nevidently a little disposed to rebel at being deprived of his tennis.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' said the General; 'either let's do the thing thoroughly, or\r\nnot do it at all. It's no pleasure to _me_ to be General, I can tell\r\nyou; and if I can't have perfect discipline in the ranks--why, we might\r\nas well drop the army altogether!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' said Jack, who was a sweet-tempered boy, 'we won't do\r\nit again.'\r\n\r\nAnd they went off to carry out their separate instructions, Clarence\r\nTinling remaining by the cedar.\r\n\r\n'I have to be a little sharp now and then,' he explained. 'Why, if I\r\ndidn't keep an iron rule over them, they'd be getting insubordinate in\r\nno time. You mustn't think I've any objection to their playing tennis,\r\nor anything of that sort; only discipline must be kept up; though it\r\nseems severe, perhaps, to you.'\r\n\r\n'It doesn't seem to be half bad fun for _you_, at all events,' said\r\nHazel.\r\n\r\n'Of course,' added Hilary, whose cheeks were flushed and eyes\r\nsuspiciously bright as she plucked all the blades of grass that were\r\nwithin her reach, 'we're glad if you're enjoying being here; but it's a\r\nlittle slow for us girls. You might give the army a half-holiday now and\r\nthen.'\r\n\r\n'An army, especially a small army, like ours,' said Clarence, grandly,\r\n'ought to be constantly prepared for action; else it's no use. Then,\r\nlook at the protection it is. Why, we've just built a fortified place\r\nclose to the kitchen garden, where you could all retire to if we were\r\nattacked; and, properly provisioned, we could hold out for almost any\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said Hilary. 'I should feel a good deal safer in the\r\nbox-room. And then, who's going to attack us?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you never know,' replied Clarence; 'but, if they did come, it's\r\nsomething to feel we should be able to defend ourselves.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Hilary,' Cecily remarked, 'an army would certainly be a great\r\nconvenience then.'\r\n\r\n'That would depend on what it did,' said her sister. 'It wouldn't be\r\nmuch of a convenience if it ran away.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think Jack and Guy would ever do that,' observed Hazel.\r\n\r\n'I suppose that means that you think I should?' inquired Clarence, who\r\nwas quick at discovering personal allusions.\r\n\r\n'I wasn't thinking about you at all,' said Hazel, with supreme\r\nindifference; 'we don't know you well enough to say whether you're brave\r\nor not--we do know our brothers.'\r\n\r\n'There wouldn't be much sense in my being the General if I wasn't the\r\nbravest, would there?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'Well, as to that, you see,' retorted Hilary, 'we don't see much sense\r\nin any of it.'\r\n\r\n'Girls can't be expected to see sense in anything,' he said sulkily.\r\n\r\n'At all events, no one can be expected to see bravery till there's some\r\ndanger,' said Hazel; 'and there isn't the least!'\r\n\r\n'That's all you know about it; but I've something more important to do\r\nthan stay here squabbling. I'm off to see what the army's up to.' And he\r\nmarched off with great pomp.\r\n\r\nWhen he had disappeared, Hilary remarked frankly, 'Isn't he a pig?'\r\n\r\n'I don't think it's nice to call our visitors \"pigs,\" Hilary!'\r\nremonstrated Cecily, 'and he's not really more greedy than most boys.'\r\n\r\n'Don't lecture, Cis. I didn't mean he was that kind of pig--I said he\r\nwas a pig. And he is!' said Hilary, not over lucidly. 'I wonder what\r\nJack and Guy can see in him. I thought that when they wrote asking him\r\nto be invited, that he'd be sure to be such a jolly boy!'\r\n\r\n'He may be a jolly boy--at school,' was all that even the tolerant\r\nCecily could find to urge in his favour.\r\n\r\n'I believe,' said Hazel, 'that they're not nearly so mad about him as\r\nthey were--didn't you notice about the tennis just now?'\r\n\r\n'He bullies them--that's what it is,' explained Hilary; 'only with\r\ntalking, I mean, of course, but he talks such a lot, and he will have\r\nhis own way, and, if they say anything, he reminds them he's a visitor,\r\nand ought to be humoured. I wish it was any use getting Uncle Lambert to\r\nspeak to him--but he's so stupid!'\r\n\r\n'Is he, though?' said a lazy voice from behind the cedar.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Uncle Lambkin!' cried Hilary, 'I didn't know you were there!'\r\n\r\n'Don't apologise,' was the answer. 'I know it must be a trial to have an\r\nuncle on the verge of imbecility--but bear with me. I am at least\r\nharmless.'\r\n\r\n'Of course we know you're really rather clever,' said Hazel, 'but you\r\n_are_ stupid about some things--you never interfere, whatever people\r\ndo!'\r\n\r\n'Don't I, really?' said their uncle, as he disposed himself on his back,\r\nand tilted his hat over his nose; 'you do surprise me! What a mistake\r\nfor a man to make, who has come down for perfect quiet! Whom shall I\r\nbegin to interfere with?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you might snub that horrid Tinling boy, instead of encouraging\r\nhim, as you always do!'\r\n\r\n'Encourage him! He's got a fine flow of martial enthusiasm, and a good\r\nsupply of military terms, and I listen when he gives me long accounts of\r\nthrilling engagements, when he came out uncommonly strong--and the\r\nenemy, so far as I can gather, never came out at all. I'm passive,\r\nbecause I can't help myself; and then he amuses me in his way--that's\r\nall.'\r\n\r\n'Do you believe he's brave, uncle?'\r\n\r\n'I only know that I saw him kill two wasps with his teaspoon,' was the\r\nreply. 'They don't award the Victoria Cross for it--but it's a thing I\r\ncouldn't have done myself.'\r\n\r\n'I should hope not!' exclaimed Hilary; 'but everybody knows you're a\r\ncoward,' she added (she did not intend this remark to be taken\r\nseriously), 'and you're awfully lazy. Still, there are some things you\r\nmight do!'\r\n\r\n'If that means fielding long-leg till tea-time, I respectfully disagree.\r\nIrreverent girls, have you never been taught that a digesting uncle is a\r\nvery solemn and sacred thing?'\r\n\r\n'Now you are going to be idiotic again! But as to cricket--why, you must\r\nknow that we never get a game now! And next summer I shall be too old to\r\nplay!'\r\n\r\n'I _never_ mean to be too old for cricket,' said Hilary, with\r\nconviction; 'but we've had none for weeks, uncle, positive weeks!'\r\n\r\n'Quite right, too!' observed Uncle Lambert, sleepily. 'Not a game for\r\ngirls--only spoil your hands--do you think I want a set of nieces with\r\npaws like so many glovers' signs?'\r\n\r\n'That's utter nonsense,' said Hazel, calmly, 'because we always play in\r\ngloves. Mother makes us. At least, when we did play. Now the boys will\r\nonly play soldiers, and, if they do happen to be inclined for a set at\r\ntennis, Clarence comes up and orders them off as pickets or outposts, or\r\nsomething!'\r\n\r\n'But he's not Bismarck or Boulanger, is he? I always understood this was\r\na free country.'\r\n\r\n'You know what Guy and Jack are--they can't bear their visitor to think\r\nhe isn't welcome.'\r\n\r\n'Well, they seem to have made him feel very much at home--but it isn't\r\nmy business; if they choose to declare the house in a state of siege,\r\nand turn the garden into a seat of war, I can't help it--I'd rather they\r\nwouldn't, but it's your mother's affair, not mine!'\r\n\r\nAnd he closed the discussion by lighting a cigarette, and relapsing into\r\na contented silence.\r\n\r\nUncle Lambert was short and stout, with a round red face, a heavy auburn\r\nmoustache, and little green eyes which never seemed to notice anything.\r\nHis nieces were fond of him, though they often wished he would pay them\r\nthe occasional compliment of talking sensibly; but he never did, and he\r\nspent all his time at The Gables in elaborately doing nothing at all.\r\n\r\nClarence Tinling had gone off in a decided huff--so much so indeed that\r\nhe left his devoted army to carry out their rather misty manoeuvres\r\nwithout any help from him. He was beginning to find a falling-off in\r\ntheir docility of late, which was no doubt owing to their sisters; it\r\nwas excessively annoying to him that those girls should be so difficult\r\nto convince of the protective value of a fortress, and especially that\r\nthey should decline to take his own superior nerve and courage for\r\ngranted. And the worst of it was, nothing but some imminent danger was\r\never likely to convince them, such were their prejudice and\r\nnarrow-mindedness.\r\n\r\nLater that afternoon the family assembled for tea in the cool, shady\r\ndining-room; Mrs. Jolliffe, with a gentle anxiety on her usually placid\r\nface, sat at the head (Colonel Jolliffe was away shooting in the North\r\njust then). 'Where are all the boys?' she said, looking round the table.\r\n'Why don't they come in?'\r\n\r\n'It's no use asking us, mother,' said Hilary, 'we see so very little of\r\nthem ever.'\r\n\r\n'Very likely they are washing their hands,' said her mother.\r\n\r\n'So _like_ them!' murmured Uncle Lambert in confidence to his tea-cake.\r\n'But here's the noble General, at all events. Well, Field Marshal, what\r\nhave you done with the Standing Army?'\r\n\r\nTinling addressed himself to his hostess. 'Oh, Mrs. Jolliffe, I'm so\r\nsorry I was late, but I had just to run round to the stables for a\r\nminute. Oh, the other two? They're on duty--they're guarding the camp.\r\nIn fact, I can't stay here very long myself.'\r\n\r\n'But the poor dear boys must have their tea!' cried Mrs. Jolliffe.\r\n\r\n'Well, you know,' said their veteran officer, as he helped himself to\r\nthe marmalade, 'I don't think a little roughing it is at all a bad\r\nthing for them--teaches them that a soldier's life is not all jam.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Hazel, 'the General seems to get most of that.'\r\n\r\nAll Clarence said was: 'I'll trouble one of you girls for the tea-cake.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think it's fair that the poor army should \"rough,\" as you call\r\nit, while you stuff, Clarence,' said Hazel, indignantly. 'Mustn't they\r\ncome in to tea, mother? It is such nonsense!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear, run and call them in,' said Mrs. Jolliffe. 'I can't let my\r\nboys go without their meals, Clarence, it's so bad for them.'\r\n\r\n'It's not discipline,' said the chief; 'still, if they must come, you\r\nhad better take them this permit from me.' And he scribbled a line on a\r\nscrap of paper, which he handed to Hazel, who received it with the\r\nutmost disdain.\r\n\r\nHazel crossed the lawn and over a little rustic bridge to the kitchen\r\ngarden and hothouses, beyond which was the paddock, where the fortress\r\nhad been erected. It was a very imposing construction, built, with some\r\nhelp from the village carpenter, of portions of some disused fencing.\r\nThe stockade had loopholes in it, and above the top she could see a\r\nfluttering flag and the point of a tent. Jack was perched up on a kind\r\nof look-out, and Guy was pacing solemnly before the covered entrance\r\nwith a musket of very mild aspect over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Who goes there?' he called out, some time after recognising her.\r\n\r\nHazel vouchsafed no direct reply to this challenge. 'You're to come in\r\nto tea _directly_,' she announced in her most peremptory tone.\r\n\r\n'Advance, and give the countersign,' said the sentinel.\r\n\r\n'Don't be a donkey!' returned Hazel, tossing back her long brown hair\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nGuy levelled his firearm. It is exasperating when a sister can't enter\r\ninto the spirit of the thing better than that. Who ever heard of a\r\nsentry being told, on challenging, 'not to be a donkey'? 'My orders are\r\nto fire on all suspicious persons,' he informed her.\r\n\r\nHazel stopped both her ears. 'No, Guy, please--it makes me jump so.'\r\n\r\n'There's no cap on,' said he.\r\n\r\n'Then there's a ramrod, or a pea, or something horrid,' she objected;\r\n'do turn it the other way.'\r\n\r\n'Hazel's all right, Guy,' said Jack, in rebuke of this excessive zeal;\r\n'we can let her pass.'\r\n\r\n'As if I wanted to pass!' exclaimed Hazel. 'I only came to bring you\r\nback to tea; and if you're afraid to go without leave, there's a\r\npermission from Clarence for you.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! come in and have a look now you're here,' said the garrison more\r\nhospitably. 'You can't think how jolly the inside is.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if I must,' she said; though, as a matter of fact, she was\r\nexceedingly curious to see the interior of the stronghold.\r\n\r\n'It's like the ones in \"Masterman Ready\" and \"Treasure Island,\" you\r\nsee,' explained Jack, proudly. 'And it's pierced for musketry, too; we\r\ncould open a withering fire on besiegers before they could come near\r\nus.'\r\n\r\n'They would have to be rather stupid to want to besiege this, wouldn't\r\nthey?' said Hazel.\r\n\r\n'I don't see that--besiegers must besiege something. And it is snug,\r\nisn't it, now?'\r\n\r\nHazel was secretly much impressed. In the centre of the enclosure was\r\nthe commander's tent, with a lantern fixed at the pole for night\r\nwatches; and rugs and carpets were strewn about; at one of the angles of\r\nthe palisading was the look-out--an elaborate erection of old wine-cases\r\nand egg-boxes--on the top of which was fixed a seven-and-sixpenny\r\ntelescope that commanded the surrounding country for quite a hundred\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nShe was not the person, however, to go into raptures; she merely smiled\r\na rather teasing little smile, and said, 'Mar-vellous!' but somehow,\r\nwhatever sarcasm underlay this was accepted by both boys as a tribute.\r\n\r\n'You can see now,' said Guy, in a reasonable tone, 'that there wouldn't\r\nhave been room here for all you girls--now, would there?'\r\n\r\n'Girls are always in the way--everywhere,' said Hazel, with a\r\nreproachful inflection which was quite lost upon her brothers.\r\n\r\n'I knew you'd be sensible about it,' said Jack; 'you can't think what\r\nfun we have in here--especially at night, when the lantern's lit. Hallo!\r\nthere's some one calling.'\r\n\r\nA shrill whistle sounded from the kitchen garden, and, a moment after, a\r\nstone came flying over the stockade, and was stopped by the canvas of\r\nthe tent.\r\n\r\n'That's cool cheek!' said Jack; 'get up and reconnoitre, Guy--quick!'\r\n\r\nGuy mounted the scaffold, and brought the telescope to bear upon the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood with admirable coolness and science--but no\r\nparticular result.\r\n\r\n'We shall have to scour the bush and see if we can find any traces of\r\nthe enemy,' said he with infinite relish.\r\n\r\n'Was that the stone?' said Hazel, pointing to one that lay at the foot\r\nof the fence; 'because there seems to be some paper wrapped round it.'\r\n\r\n'So there is!' said Jack, proceeding to unfold it. Presently he\r\nexclaimed, 'I _say_!'\r\n\r\n'What is it now?' asked Hazel.\r\n\r\n'Nothing for you--it's private!' said Jack, mysteriously. 'Here, Guy,\r\ncome down and look at this.'\r\n\r\nGuy read it and whistled. 'We must report this to the General at once,'\r\nhe said gravely.\r\n\r\nBoth boys were very solemn, and yet had a certain novel air of satisfied\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n'Shall we tell her?' asked Guy.\r\n\r\n'She must know it some time,' returned Jack; 'we'll break it by\r\ndegrees.--We've just had notice that we're going to be attacked by Red\r\nIndians, Hazel; don't be alarmed.'\r\n\r\n'I'll try not to be,' she said, conquering a very strong inclination to\r\nlaugh. She saw that they took it quite seriously; and, though she had at\r\nonce suspected that some one in the village was playing them a trick,\r\nshe did not choose to enlighten them. Hazel had a malicious desire to\r\nsee what the General would do. 'I don't believe he will like the idea at\r\nall,' she said to herself. 'What fun it will be!'\r\n\r\nHazel's expectations seemed about to be fulfilled; for already she could\r\nhear steps on the plank of the little bridge, and in another minute the\r\nGeneral himself entered the fortress.\r\n\r\n'I say, you fellows,' he began, 'this is too bad--no one on guard, and a\r\ngirl inside! Why, she might be a spy for anything you could tell!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Clarence!' said Hazel; for this insinuation was rather\r\ntrying to a person of her dignity.\r\n\r\n'I say, General,' began Jack, 'never mind about rowing us now; we've\r\nsome queer news to report. This has just fallen into our hands.'\r\n\r\nHazel watched Tinling closely as he read the paper. It was grimy, and\r\nprinted in lead pencil, and contained these words:--'BE ON THE LUKOUT.\r\nRED INGIANS ON THE WORPATH. I HERD THEM SAYING THEY MENT TO ATACK YURE\r\nFORT AT NITEFAL. FROM A FREND.'\r\n\r\nShe was soon compelled to own that she had done him a great injustice.\r\nHe was certainly as far as possible from betraying the slightest fear;\r\non the contrary, his eye seemed actually to brighten with satisfaction.\r\nHe behaved exactly as all heroes in books of adventure do on such\r\noccasions--he went through it twice carefully, and then inquired at what\r\ntime the warning had arrived.\r\n\r\n'About five minutes ago. Round a stone,' answered Guy, with true\r\nmilitary conciseness.\r\n\r\n'This will be a bad business,' observed the General, his face\r\nbrightening with the joy of battle. 'We have no time to spare--we must\r\ngive these demons a lesson they will not forget!' (this was out of the\r\nbooks). 'Look to your arms, my men, and see that we are provisioned for\r\na siege (you might get the cook to give us some of that shortbread, and\r\nthe rest of the cake we had at tea, Private Jack). We cannot tell to\r\nwhat straits we may be reduced.'\r\n\r\n'Then,' inquired Hazel, demurely, 'you mean to stay here and fight\r\nthem?'\r\n\r\n'To the last gasp!' said the General.\r\n\r\nHazel liked him better then than she had done since his first arrival.\r\n\r\n'He really is a plucky boy after all,' she thought. 'I wonder if it will\r\nlast?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THE SECOND\r\n\r\nWHERE IS THE ARMY?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General's self-possession and resource were indeed remarkable.\r\n\r\n'We ought to have a cannon,' he said; 'there's a big roll of matting\r\nsomewhere in the house. If we got that, and widened a loophole, and\r\nshoved it through, it would look just like the muzzle of a cannon in the\r\ndark.'\r\n\r\n'Would that frighten a Red Indian much?' asked Hazel.\r\n\r\n'Not if he knew what it was, perhaps; but who's going to tell him? Jack,\r\njust run up to the house, like a good fellow, and see if you can find\r\nit, will you? You can go with him, Guy.'\r\n\r\n'You seem rather to like the idea of being attacked,' said Hazel, when\r\nshe and Clarence were alone together. He was gratified to notice the new\r\nfriendliness in her voice.\r\n\r\n'Well, you see,' he explained loftily, 'I don't suppose I'm pluckier\r\nthan most people, but it just happens that I'm not afraid of Red\r\nIndians, that's all; when I saw all those at Buffalo Bill's I wasn't\r\neven excited: it's constitutional, I fancy.' He always modelled his talk\r\na good deal upon books, and a crisis like this naturally brought out his\r\nlargest language.\r\n\r\n'I'd better see you safe back to the house, I think,' he added; 'I don't\r\nexpect them for an hour yet, but you can never depend on savages--they\r\nmight be lurking about the grounds already, for what we know.'\r\n\r\nAnd, although Hazel had her own private ideas about the reality of the\r\ndanger, she was struck by his coolness and courage, for which, whether\r\njustified or not by the occasion, she was quite fair-minded enough to\r\ngive him due credit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the other two boys, bursting with excitement, had rushed up\r\nto the verandah, under which their mother and uncle were sitting.\r\n\r\n'Mother! Uncle Lambert! What do you think? Our camp is going to be\r\nattacked this very night by Indians!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dears,' said Mrs. Jolliffe, serenely; 'but have you had your teas\r\nyet?'\r\n\r\nTrifles such as these harrow the martial soul more than conflicts.\r\n\r\n'But, mother, did you hear what we said? The fort is to be stormed by\r\nRed Indians!'\r\n\r\n'Very well, dears, so long as you don't make too much noise,' was the\r\nsole comment of this most provokingly placid lady. What she ought to\r\nhave done was, of course, to throw down her work, raise her eyes to the\r\nclouds, clasp her hands, and observe, in an agitated tone, 'Heaven\r\nprotect us! We are lost!' But few mothers are capable of really rising\r\nto emergencies of this kind.\r\n\r\nHilary and Cecily had been playing tennis, and, overhearing the alarming\r\nnews, came up to the steps of the verandah. 'Did you say Red Indians\r\nwere coming here?'\r\n\r\nUncle Lambert shook his head lugubriously. 'I always warned your\r\nfather,' he remarked; 'but he _would_ come to live in Berkshire.'\r\n\r\n'Why?' inquired Cecily. 'Is Berkshire a bad place for Red Indians,\r\nuncle?'\r\n\r\n'I should say it was one of the worst places in all Europe!' he said\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\nBoth Hilary and Cecily had heard and read a good deal about Red Indians\r\nlately, and had also, with their brothers, visited the American\r\nExhibition, so that it did not strike either of them as unlikely just\r\nthen that there should be a few scattered about in England, just as\r\ngipsies are.\r\n\r\n'But what are you going to do about it?' they asked their brother.\r\n\r\n'Lick 'em, of course!' said Guy. 'Now you see that an army is some use,\r\nafter all.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be taken alive, there's good boys,' advised their frivolous\r\nuncle, who seemed still unable to realise the extreme gravity of the\r\noccasion. 'Sell your lives as dearly as possible.'\r\n\r\n'What is the use of telling them that, uncle?' exclaimed Cecily. 'They\r\nwouldn't get the money; and do you think any of _us_ would touch it? How\r\ncan you talk in that horrid way? Jack and Guy, don't go to that camp.\r\nLet the Indians have it, if they want to; you can soon build another.'\r\n\r\n'You don't understand,' said Jack, impatiently. 'We can't have a lot of\r\nRed Indians in our camp--it wouldn't be safe for you.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I shall go and speak to Clarence,' she cried. 'I'm sure he won't\r\nwant to fight them.' And she ran down to the end of the lawn, where he\r\ncould be seen returning with Hazel.\r\n\r\n'I want to speak to you quite alone,' she said. 'No, Hazel, it's a\r\nsecret,' and she drew him aside.\r\n\r\n'Clarence,' she said, and her blue eyes were dark with fear, 'tell\r\nme--are the Indians really coming?'\r\n\r\n'You can judge for yourself,' he said, and gave her the paper. 'We've\r\njust had this thrown over the stockade. It seems to have been written by\r\nsomebody who is in their secrets.'\r\n\r\n'How badly Red Indians do spell!' said Cecily, shuddering as she read.\r\n\r\n'It may be a white man's writing,' he said; 'perhaps a prisoner, or a\r\nconfederate who repents.'\r\n\r\n'But, Clarence, dear,' entreated Cecily (ten minutes ago she would not\r\nhave added the epithet), 'you won't stay out and sit up for them, will\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'Do you think we're a set of cowards?' he demanded grandly.\r\n\r\n'Not you, Clarence; but--but Jack and Guy are not very big boys, are\r\nthey? I mean, they're a little too young to fight full-sized Indians.'\r\n\r\n'There will be all sorts of sized Indians, I expect,' said Clarence. 'Of\r\ncourse, I don't say they'll come. They may think discretion's the better\r\npart of valour when they find we're prepared; but I must say I\r\nanticipate an attack myself.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you would do without Jack and Guy. Couldn't you?' suggested\r\nCecily.\r\n\r\nHis eyes gleamed. 'Cecily,' he said, 'tell me the worst--the army are\r\ngetting in a funk?'\r\n\r\n'No,' she cried; and then she resolved to sacrifice their reputation for\r\ntheir safety. 'At least, they haven't said anything; but I'm sure they'd\r\nfeel more comfortable in the drawing-room. Can't you order them to stay\r\nand guard us? You're General.'\r\n\r\n'And I am to face the foe alone?' he cried. 'Well, I am older than them'\r\n(I must decline to be responsible for the grammar of the characters of\r\nthis story). 'I have lived my life--I shall be the less missed.... Let\r\nit be as you say.'\r\n\r\nAll this was strictly according to the books, and he enjoyed himself\r\nimmensely.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, dear, dear Clarence. I'd no idea you were so noble and\r\nbrave. Try not to let those Indians hit you.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot answer for the future,' he said; 'but since you wish it I will\r\ndo my best.'\r\n\r\nAfter all there was some good in girls. Here was one who said exactly\r\nthe right things, without needing any prompting whatever.\r\n\r\nCecily hunted up Jack and Guy, who were poking about in the house.\r\n'You're not to guard the stockade,' she announced, with ill-concealed\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n'Oh, aren't we, though?' said Guy; 'who says so? Not mother!'\r\n\r\n'No--Clarence; he said I was to tell you to go on duty in the\r\ndrawing-room.'\r\n\r\n'What bosh!' said Guy. 'As if any Indians would come there! I don't care\r\nwhat Clarence says, I shall go in the stockade!'\r\n\r\n'So shall I! 'said Jack. 'Now let's get that piece of matting, and go\r\ndown sharp--the evening star's out already.'\r\n\r\nPoor Cecily was in despair; what was to be done when they were so\r\nobstinate as this?\r\n\r\n'I know where there's some beautiful matting,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Where? Tell us, quick!'\r\n\r\n'Come with me, and I'll show you.' She led the way along a corridor to\r\nthe wing where the billiard-room was. 'Wait till I see if it's there\r\nstill,' she said, and went into the billiard-room and looked around.\r\n'Yes, it _is_ there,' she told them as she came out.\r\n\r\n'I don't see it, Cecily; where?' they cried from within.\r\n\r\nCecily shut the door softly, and turned the key (which she had managed\r\nto abstract on entering) in the outer lock.\r\n\r\n'It's on the floor,' she cried through the keyhole; 'I didn't tell a\r\nstory--and don't be angry, boys, dear, it's all for your good!'\r\n\r\nThen, without waiting to hear their indignant outcry, she scudded along\r\nthe corridor and down the staircase, with the sounds of muffled shouts\r\nand kicks growing fainter behind her.\r\n\r\n'I don't mind so much now,' she thought; 'they'll be awfully angry when\r\nthey come out--but the Indians will have gone by that time!'\r\n\r\nClarence had already retreated to his stronghold when she entered the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed as usual; Uncle Lambert, in evening dress, was playing\r\ndesultory snatches from _Ruddigore_. Mrs. Jolliffe came down presently,\r\nand he took her in to dinner with one of his tiresome jokes. No one\r\nseemed at all anxious about poor Tinling, fighting all alone down in the\r\npaddock.\r\n\r\nShe curled herself up on a settee by one of the open windows, and\r\nlistened, trying to catch the sound of Indian yells. 'Hazel,' she said\r\nanxiously, 'do you think the Indians will hurt Tinling?'\r\n\r\nHazel gave a little laugh. 'I don't think the army's in any very great\r\ndanger, Cis,' she replied.\r\n\r\n'Hazel doesn't believe there are any Indians at all,' explained Hilary.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Cecily, softly, 'I've kept the army out of danger, whether\r\nthere are or not!'\r\n\r\nBut she felt relieved by her sisters' evident tranquillity, and\r\nby-and-by, when Mrs. Jolliffe came in from the dining-room and settled\r\ndown with her embroidery as if there were not the least chance of a\r\nsavage coming whooping in the open window, Cecily almost forgot her\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nThey came back in full force, however, as, a little later on, she heard\r\na quick, light step on the gravel outside, and started with a little\r\nscream of terror. 'Don't tell them where the army are!' she cried; and\r\nthen she saw that her alarm was needless, for it was the gallant General\r\nwho stepped into the room. Hazel looked up from the album which she was\r\nmaking for a children's hospital, Hilary threw away her book, Mrs.\r\nJolliffe had ceased to embroider, but that was because she was\r\npeacefully dozing.\r\n\r\n'Victory!' said Clarence, waving his sword.\r\n\r\n'Then they did come?' cried Cecily, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n'Rather!' he replied. 'I couldn't tell how many there were, but they\r\nwere overcome with panic at the first discharge. I fancy _these_ Indians\r\nhad never heard firearms before.'\r\n\r\n'How funny that we shouldn't have heard any now!' remarked Hazel,\r\nresting her chin on her palms, while her grey eyes had a rather mocking\r\nsparkle in them.\r\n\r\n'Not funny at all,' he said, 'considering the wind was the other way. I\r\nlet them come on, and then poured a volley into the thickest part of\r\ntheir ranks--that made them waver, and then I made a sortie, and you\r\nshould have just seen them scuttle!'\r\n\r\n'I wish I had,' said Hazel, as she pasted another Christmas card into\r\nher album. 'And weren't you wounded at all?'\r\n\r\n'A mere scratch,' he said lightly (which is what book-heroes always\r\nsay).\r\n\r\n'It looks as if you had been amongst the gooseberry-bushes,' said\r\nHilary, examining his arm as he pulled up his sleeve.\r\n\r\n'Does it? Well, I only know it's lucky for me there were no poisoned\r\narrows.'\r\n\r\n'Oughtn't you to have it burnt, though, Clarence, just in case?'\r\nsuggested Cecily, in all good faith; 'there's sure to be a red-hot poker\r\nin the kitchen.'\r\n\r\nBut Clarence was very decidedly of opinion that such a precaution was\r\nnot necessary.\r\n\r\n'And you're quite sure the Indians are all gone?' she asked.\r\n\r\n'There isn't one of 'em within miles,' he said confidently, 'I'll answer\r\nfor that.'\r\n\r\n'Then come upstairs with me, and we'll let the army out. They'll be in\r\nsuch a temper!'\r\n\r\nThey found the two boys, who had tired of kicking and shouting by that\r\ntime, sitting gloomily on the long seats in the dark.\r\n\r\n'Guy, dear--Jack,' said Cecily, timidly, 'you can come out now. Clarence\r\nhas beaten the Indians.'\r\n\r\n'Without us?' groaned Guy. 'Cecily, I'll never speak to you again!\r\nTinling, I--we--you don't think we funked, do you? She locked us up\r\nhere!'\r\n\r\nAll the General's native magnanimity came out now.\r\n\r\n'We won't say any more about it,' he said. 'It was rather a close shave,\r\nwith only one man to do it all. But, there, I managed somehow, and\r\nperhaps it was just as well you weren't there. The first rush was no\r\njoke, I can tell you.'\r\n\r\nJack punched his own head with both hands.\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's too bad!' he said--he was almost in tears. 'They'll all think\r\nwe deserted you! Did you kill many of them, Tinling?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't see any corpses,' he replied; 'but I shouldn't be surprised if\r\nsome of them died when they got home.'\r\n\r\n'They may come again to-morrow night,' said Jack, more cheerfully.\r\n\r\n'Not much fear of that--they've had their lesson. They were seized with\r\nutter panic.'\r\n\r\n'Which way did they go?' asked Guy, evidently bent on pursuing them.\r\n\r\n'Oh, in all directions. But you wouldn't catch them up now; they ran too\r\nfast for me even!'\r\n\r\n'Then I shall go to bed,' said the entire army, in great depression. 'It\r\nis a shame we couldn't be there. Good-night, General.' And, pointedly\r\nignoring poor Cecily, they marched off to their quarters. She looked\r\nwistfully after them.\r\n\r\n'They'll never forgive me--I know they won't!' she said to Tinling.\r\n\r\n'Don't you mind,' he said, 'you acted very wisely. And, after all, these\r\nraw young troops can never be depended on under fire, you know--I mean,\r\nunder arrows.'\r\n\r\nCecily drew herself up a little haughtily.\r\n\r\n'I locked them in because I didn't want them to get hurt,' she said,\r\n'not because I thought they'd be afraid.'\r\n\r\nUncle Lambert did not hear about the result of the engagement until the\r\nfollowing day, but then, to make up for any delay, he heard a good deal\r\nabout it. Even Clarence was not quite prepared for the enthusiasm he\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\n'Splendid, my boy, splendid!' he kept repeating, while he hit him rather\r\nhard on the back; 'you're a hero. A grateful country ought to give you\r\nthe Bath for it. I shall take care this affair is generally known.'\r\n\r\nAnd the poor army looked on with hot cheeks and envious eyes. But for\r\nCecily, they might have been heroes, too!\r\n\r\nEven Hazel seemed to have understood that a really brilliant victory had\r\nbeen achieved; she brought Tinling a magnificent flag of pink glazed\r\ncalico, on which she had painted in crimson letters: 'Indians' Terror.'\r\n\r\n'I did not think of making the motto \"Seven at one blow,\"' she said,\r\nwith a mischievous dimple.\r\n\r\n'I like the other best,' said the General, unsuspectingly.\r\n\r\nJack and Guy went down to the camp as usual, but for some time they were\r\nin very low spirits, in spite of their commander's well-meant efforts to\r\nraise them.\r\n\r\n'You'll do better next time,' he said kindly.\r\n\r\n'But we've told you over and over again how it was!' they would exclaim.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know, I know. It's all right. I'm not complaining: I never\r\nexpected you to be as cool as I was, your first time.' But even this did\r\nnot seem to console the army to any large extent; they hunched their\r\nshoulders and kicked pebbles about with great apparent interest.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, they could not help seeing that they had lost their\r\nprestige. It was true that their mother and elder sister at least (in\r\nspite of the flag) did not seem to treat the past danger with all the\r\nseriousness it deserved. It even struck Jack and Guy sometimes that\r\nthey were under the delusion that the whole thing had been only a new\r\ndevelopment of the game. But as the General said: 'Even if that were so,\r\nit was kinder not to undeceive them. He certainly was contented to leave\r\nthem in their error; he knew well enough what he had had to go\r\nthrough--he did not like even now to think of his despair when he found\r\nhe would have to face the danger all alone.'\r\n\r\nHe was always making the army writhe by little unintentional reminders\r\nof this kind, and they had cruel misgivings that Uncle Lambert, though\r\nhe was always quite kind and encouraging, did not in his heart believe\r\nthat their unfortunate absence in the hour of peril was quite an\r\naccident on their part.\r\n\r\nHow they longed for an opportunity of wiping out their disgrace, and how\r\ntheir hearts sank when Tinling, from the depths of his experience,\r\ndeclared it very improbable that the attack would ever again be renewed.\r\nIn the school-stories, the good boy who refuses to fight when he is\r\nkicked, and is sent to Coventry as a coward, always gets a speedy chance\r\nto clear his character. Someone (generally the very boy who kicked him)\r\nfalls into a mill-stream, or a convenient horse runs away, or else a mad\r\nbut considerate bull comes into the playground--and the good boy is\r\nalways at hand to dive, or hang on to the bridle and be dragged several\r\nyards in the dust, or slowly retreat backwards, throwing down first his\r\nhat and then his coat to amuse and detain the infuriated bull.\r\n\r\nBut out of stories, unfortunately, as even Jack and Guy dimly perceived,\r\nthings are not always arranged so satisfactorily. They might have to\r\nwait for weeks, perhaps months or years, before Uncle Lambert fell into\r\nthe fish-pond--and, even if he did, he could probably swim better than\r\nthey could. Then they were neither of them sure that they could\r\nsuccessfully stop a runaway horse, or a maniac bull, without a little\r\nmore practice than they had had as yet.\r\n\r\nHowever, Fortune was kind, and took pity on them in a most unexpected\r\nmanner. For one morning, soon after breakfast, when Hazel was practising\r\nin the music-room, and Hilary and Cecily feeding their rabbits, Jack\r\ncame up in a highly-excited state of mind to the verandah where his\r\nofficer was seated doing nothing in particular. 'General,' he said, with\r\na very creditable salute, 'do come down to the camp at once.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, bother!' said the veteran warrior, who had, by the way, shown\r\nrather a tendency to rest on his laurels of late.\r\n\r\n'No, but it isn't humbug, really,' protested Jack; 'it's something\r\nyou'll like awfully.'\r\n\r\nThe General marched down in a very stately manner; it would have been\r\nundignified to run, eager as he was to get down to the stockade,\r\nthinking it not unlikely that Lintoft, the carpenter, really had found\r\ntime to make a cannon for them after all, or, at the very least, that\r\nthere would be some change in the internal arrangements of the\r\nstronghold which it would be his duty as superior officer to criticise,\r\nif not condemn.\r\n\r\nNow it must be explained here that, during the last two or three days,\r\nthe outside wall of the fort had been placarded with various bills, all\r\nglorying in the recent repulse of the enemy by a single-handed defender,\r\nand containing most insulting reflections on the courage of Red Indians\r\nas a race; while, in case they might not have enough knowledge of\r\nEnglish to understand these taunts, they were accompanied by sketches\r\nwhich were certainly scathing enough to infuriate the least susceptible\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\nTo do Clarence justice, they were not due to any elation on his part,\r\nbut had all been executed by the army in the wild hope that they might\r\nthus stir up the foe to a fresh demonstration, when they themselves\r\nmight recover their lost spurs.\r\n\r\nThese placards, as Clarence found on reaching the stockade, had been\r\nscrawled over with a kind of red and yellow paint so as to be quite\r\nillegible.\r\n\r\n'Ochre,' said Guy; 'but that's not the best of it, for we found this\r\npinned with an arrow to one of the posts.' And he produced a thin strip\r\nof white bark, on which were writing and drawings in crimson. 'They must\r\nhave done it with their own blood,' commented Jack, with great gusto;\r\n'but read it--do read it.'\r\n\r\nClarence did not need a second invitation to read the document, which\r\nwas as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                  'WAH NA SA PASH BOO (YELLOW VULTURE),\r\n\r\n        _Chief of Black Bogallala Tribe, to the Great White Chief,\r\n                          Tin Lin_, DEFIANCE.\r\n\r\n     'The wigwam of Yellow Vulture wants but one ornament--the scalp of\r\n     the white chief. Yellow Vulture has seen the taunts calling the red\r\n     warriors \"women with the hearts of deer.\" He will show the Paleface\r\n     that the anger of the dusky ones is a big heap-lot terrible. When\r\n     the sun has set behind the hills, and the stars light their\r\n     watch-fires, then will Yellow Vulture and his braves be at hand.\r\n     The scalp of the Paleface shall adorn the tepee of the Red Man.\r\n\r\n                               'WAH-WAH!'\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that there should be no possible mistake about the intention,\r\nthe message was supplemented by a rude representation of the process of\r\nscalping, evidently the work of a practised hand.\r\n\r\n'Didn't I tell you we had something jolly to show you!' exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\nBut joy, or some equally powerful emotion, rendered the General\r\nincapable of speaking for several moments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THE THIRD\r\n\r\nWHERE IS THE GENERAL?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some little time before Clarence Tinling gave any opinion upon\r\nthis bloodthirsty document. He turned exceedingly red, and examined it\r\nsuspiciously on both sides. It seemed as if he did not altogether\r\nwelcome this second opportunity for distinguishing himself. When he\r\nspoke it was with a sort of angry anxiety.\r\n\r\n'You think yourselves very clever, I dare say,' he said; 'but you\r\nneedn't fancy you'll take me in! Come, you had better say so at\r\nonce--you did this yourselves? It is not half bad--I will say that for\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'That we didn't,' cried Guy. 'Why, just look at it, Tinling. Any one\r\ncould see that it's an Indian's doing. No, it's all right; they really\r\nare coming.'\r\n\r\n'It's all skittles, I tell you,' said Clarence, still more angrily,\r\nthough he was paler again now. 'What should Indians come here for?'\r\n\r\n'Well, he says why, there,' said Jack, 'and they came the other\r\nevening.'\r\n\r\nClarence's colour rose again. 'That's different,' he said; 'I mean, it's\r\nnot the same tribe.'\r\n\r\n'No, these are Black Bogallalas,' said Jack. 'What were the first ones,\r\nTinling?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't ask them,' said the General shortly.\r\n\r\n'How many braves should you think Wah Na What's-his-name will bring?'\r\nasked Guy. 'As many as came the other evening? How many did come the\r\nfirst time?'\r\n\r\n'Do you think I had nothing better to do than count?' he retorted. 'Is\r\nthere anything else you would like to know?'\r\n\r\n'Well, we'll hang out the lantern to-night, and watch how many come\r\ninside its rays,' said Jack, with a briskness which displeased his\r\nchief.\r\n\r\n'You wouldn't be quite so jolly cheerful over it if you knew what it was\r\nlike!' he grumbled.\r\n\r\n'Why not?' said Guy. 'You beat the others easily enough by yourself, and\r\nwe shall be three this time.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's all very fine to talk,' retorted the General; 'but we shall\r\nsee what your mother and uncle say about it. They--they may think we\r\nought not to take any notice of it.'\r\n\r\nJack's eyes opened wide at this. 'Not take any notice of an attack by\r\nBlack Bogallalas! I don't see how we can very well help noticing it!'\r\n\r\n'It all depends on what Mrs. Jolliffe says,' replied the conscientious\r\nGeneral. 'I'm only a visitor here, and it wouldn't be the right thing\r\nfor me to lead you into danger without leave.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you weren't so particular the first time the Indians came!'\r\nremarked Guy.\r\n\r\n'Will you shut up about that first time!' the Commander burst out, in\r\nexasperation; 'it's the second time now--that is, if it isn't all\r\nhumbug. That's what I mean to find out first--you stay here till I come\r\nback, will you?'\r\n\r\nTaking the strip of bark with him, he went slowly up to the house. He\r\nhad an uneasy feeling that the Indian's challenge was genuine enough,\r\nbut he still hoped to have it pronounced a forgery. This may seem\r\nstrange indeed to some, considering the courage of which he had already\r\ngiven proof, but I do not wish to make any further mystery, particularly\r\nas most of my readers will probably have already guessed the secret of\r\nthis apparent contrast.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, then, that Clarence Tinling had the best of reasons for\r\nbeing cool and courageous on the previous occasion. Those Indians were\r\nentirely imaginary; he had written the warning himself, and instructed\r\nthe coachman's boy to throw it over the stockade; the attack on the fort\r\nand the brilliant victory were an afterthought.\r\n\r\nWhat had he done it for? That is rather difficult to explain--perhaps he\r\nhardly knew himself; he had a vague idea of proving to those\r\ndisrespectful girls that enemies did exist, and that the protection of\r\nan Army was not to be despised.\r\n\r\nThen when he found himself alone in the camp, the temptation to carry\r\nhis invention further was too much for him; and after Jack and Guy and\r\nCecily, and even Uncle Lambert himself, accepted his story without\r\nhesitation, and treated him as a hero--why, it would have looked so\r\nsilly to explain then, and so he went through with it.\r\n\r\nLying is lying, whatever explanations and excuses may be made respecting\r\nit, and I am afraid it must be admitted that Tinling, if he began by a\r\nmere harmless device for giving a new turn to the game, ended by telling\r\nsome very unmistakable lies.\r\n\r\nNow he found himself in a most delicate position: what if an attack by\r\nRed Indians should really be quite possible? Mr. Lambert Jolliffe had\r\ncertainly not seemed to see anything incredible in the former visit,\r\nand, though Clarence had not a very high opinion of his abilities, he\r\nwas grown up, and was not likely to be misinformed on such a point as\r\nthat--at all events, he was the best person to consult just then. As he\r\nexpected, he found him under the big ilex on his back, with his\r\nafter-breakfast pipe, no longer alight, between his lips.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Jolliffe; I say, Mr. Jolliffe,' began Clarence.\r\n\r\nLambert Jolliffe sat up, and fixed his glass in one drowsy eye. 'Hullo,\r\nSir Garnet--I beg your pardon, Lord Wolseley, I mean. You ought to hear\r\nwhat they're saying at the War Office, I can tell you!'\r\n\r\nPraise is sweet, even when we do not deserve it, and Clarence felt a\r\nthrill of satisfaction at this somewhat vague tribute.\r\n\r\n'I wanted to ask you,' he said, 'should you say that Red Indians\r\nwere--well, common in England?'\r\n\r\n'You have asked me a straightforward question, and I'll give you a\r\nstraightforward answer,' was the reply. 'Till quite lately I should say\r\nthey were absolutely unknown in this country.'\r\n\r\nClarence's face brightened; he felt quite fond of Uncle Lambert, and\r\nbegan to think him a particularly well-informed and entertaining person.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' continued Uncle Lambert, thoughtfully, 'I must confess I thought\r\nit a little unlikely at first that you should have been annoyed by Red\r\nIndians; but, of course, when I remembered the Earl's Court Show, I saw\r\nat once that it was quite possible.' Clarence felt a cold qualm. He had,\r\nas we already know, seen Buffalo Bill's wonderful show, which, indeed,\r\nwas responsible for much of his recent military enthusiasm. But till\r\nthat moment, curiously enough, it had not occurred to him to connect the\r\nmysterious Wah Na Sa Pash Boo with the denizens of the Wild West whom he\r\nhad seen careering about the immense arena at Earl's Court.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean,' he said, with an effort, 'that you thought some of\r\nBuffalo Bill's Indians had managed to _escape_?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know any other way to account for such a thing. Do you?'\r\n\r\nClarence did not answer this question directly: 'But,' he objected\r\ndesperately, 'those were _converted_ Indians. They went to church, and\r\nthe Lyceum, and all that!'\r\n\r\nUncle Lambert shrugged his shoulders: 'Once an Indian always an\r\nIndian!' he said. 'They must have their fling now and then, I suppose,\r\nand then the old Adam crops up. And you see,' he added, 'it cropped up\r\nin that attack on you the other night. Fortunately for us, and indeed\r\nfor the whole country, you were prepared for them--otherwise no one can\r\ntell what horrors we might not have seen.'\r\n\r\n'We may--we may see them yet!' said the hero, gloomily. 'Just look at\r\nthis, Mr. Jolliffe.'\r\n\r\nLambert took the bark from him, and read it with a thoughtful frown. At\r\nlast he said:\r\n\r\n'Well, I rather expected something of this sort when I saw you posting\r\nup all those insulting notices--Indians are so confoundedly touchy, you\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\n'You might have said that at the time, then!' exclaimed the General\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\nLambert lifted his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n'My dear chap, I thought you knew. Wasn't that what you were all driving\r\nat?'\r\n\r\n'Not me,' said Clarence. 'I was against it from the first. I told them\r\nit was caddish to insult a fallen foe, but they would go and stick up\r\nthose _beastly_ notices.'\r\n\r\n'All's well that ends well, eh? You've got a rise out of 'em this time.\r\nI congratulate you, my boy, on getting the chance of a second brush with\r\nthe Indians. And this time you'll have the army with you.'\r\n\r\n'A lot of good they are!' said Clarence, in a muffled voice.\r\n\r\n'Come, it's not good form for a General to run down his troops; but you\r\nheroes are always so modest. I'll be bound, now, you've determined not\r\nto mention this in the house till the danger is passed?'\r\n\r\n'No, I haven't, though. I shall mention it, most likely. Why not?'\r\n\r\n'To save them useless anxiety. Because, unless I am wrong, you see cause\r\nto apprehend (I must ask you not to conceal anything from me)--to\r\napprehend that this will be a more serious affair than the last?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I do,' replied the General, promptly, 'a good deal.'\r\n\r\n'I feared as much,' said Uncle Lambert, with a very grave face. 'But in\r\nthat case, isn't it as well not to terrify my sister and those poor\r\ngirls unnecessarily?'\r\n\r\n'I don't see that. Mrs. Jolliffe might think we ought to be guarding the\r\ninside of the house.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Uncle Lambert, 'but I should object to that strongly. You see\r\nit's very plain that it's _you_ the Yellow Vulture's after. He won't\r\nthink of coming near the house unless you're in it, and then what will\r\nbecome of us all?'\r\n\r\n'You'll take care you don't get mixed up in it, I can see,' said\r\nTinling, savagely.\r\n\r\n'I shall take very good care indeed. Oh, but you must make allowances\r\nfor me, my boy. Remember, I've not been in military training for days\r\nand days, as you have.'\r\n\r\n'If that's all, I could get you up in the drill in half-an-hour,'\r\nproposed Tinling, eagerly.\r\n\r\n'Thanks, but I have a better reason still. Tastes differ so much. You\r\nlike to spend your evenings in beating off wild Indians from a stockade.\r\nNow, I prefer a plain, comfortable dinner, and a quiet cigar. I'm not\r\nsure that your way isn't the manlier of the two--but it's not nearly so\r\nmuch in my line.'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you say you're a funk, and have done with it?' Tinling said\r\nrudely.\r\n\r\n'My dear young friend,' was the placid answer, 'if Providence has\r\nendowed you with a meed of personal courage beyond that of others, it is\r\nungraceful to taunt those who are less fortunate. While I am by no means\r\nprepared to admit that I am what you so pleasingly term \"a funk,\" I\r\nreadily allow that----'\r\n\r\nBut Tinling did not stay to hear any more; he turned on his heel with an\r\nanger that had a spice of envy in it. Why, why had not he been content\r\nwith an ordinary reputation, instead of one that he must sustain now at\r\nall hazards? He could deceive himself no longer; his foolish vanity,\r\nwhich had allowed the army to post those rash defiances, had brought\r\ndown some real Red Indians upon him, and he was horribly afraid.\r\n\r\nAs he walked restlessly down the path, a veil seemed drawn across the\r\nbrilliant sky, the dahlias and 'red-hot pokers' and gladioli in the beds\r\nburnt with a sinister glow, the smell of the sweet peas and mignonette\r\nseemed oppressive, the bees droning about the lavender patches had a\r\nnote of warning in their buzz, he felt chilly in the shade and sick in\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nHe saw nothing for it but fighting, but the idea of facing a horde of\r\nhowling savages with only two boys younger than himself was too\r\nappalling; he must engage recruits, grown-up ones, and with this\r\nintention he went to the stable-yard, where he found Chinnock, the\r\ncoachman, sluicing the carriage-wheels.\r\n\r\n'Chinnock,' he began, with an attempt to seem casual and careless,\r\n'we're going to be attacked by Red Indians again to-night.'\r\n\r\nChinnock touched a sandy forelock, as he raised his red grinning face.\r\n\r\n'Lor', sir, be you indeed? Well, you young genl'men du have rare goings\r\non down in the paddock, that you du.'\r\n\r\n'It's--it's real Red Indians this time, Chinnock--B--black Bogallalas!'\r\n\r\nChinnock had deliberately moved to the harness-room, and Tinling had to\r\nrepeat his information.\r\n\r\n'Ah, indeed, sir! Red Injians? Well, to think o' that!' he said\r\ncheerfully, as if he was humouring some rather childish remark.\r\n\r\n'But we shall want every available man; do you think you can spare time\r\nto come and help?'\r\n\r\n''Bout what time, sir?' said Chinnock.\r\n\r\n'About nine--half-past eight, say. Do try.'\r\n\r\n'Can't come as late as that, nohow, sir. That's my supper-hour, that\r\nis. If the mistress don't want the carriage to-day, I dessay I could\r\nstep down 'bout five for half-an-hour or so, if that would suit.'\r\n\r\n'That wouldn't be any use at all, Chinnock; we shan't begin till dark.'\r\n\r\n'Then I'm afraid I can't be of no sarvice to 'ee, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe poor General turned away: evidently the coachman had no intention of\r\nrisking his life. He remembered Joe, the gardener's boy and\r\nstable-help--he was better than no one. Joe was rolling the\r\ntennis-court, and grinned sheepishly on being pressed to join.\r\n\r\n'Noa, sur,' he said, 'it doan't lay in my work fur to fight no Injins. I\r\nsee one onst at Reading Vair, I did, a nippin' about he wur, and a\r\nroarin'! I bain't goin' to hev naught to do with the likes o' he!'\r\n\r\nTinling saw only one hope left. If he could see Mrs. Jolliffe and tell\r\nher of the danger which threatened him, she might refuse permission to\r\nfight at all, or, at the very least, she would see that he had proper\r\nassistance. So into the house he went, and the first person he found was\r\nHazel, who was knitting her pretty forehead over the Latin exercise\r\nwhich had been given her as a holiday task.\r\n\r\n'I say, Hazel,' he said, with a trembling voice; but she interrupted\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n'Oh, perhaps you can help me. What's the Latin for \"Balbus says it is\r\nall over with the General\"?'\r\n\r\nHe shivered; it sounded so like an omen. 'No, but Hazel, listen,' he\r\nsaid; 'the Indians are coming again to-night.'\r\n\r\n'If you're not going to talk sensibly,' said Hazel, 'go out this\r\ninstant.'\r\n\r\nHe saw she was utterly unsympathetic, and he wandered on to the hall,\r\nwhich was used as a morning-room, where Hilary sat painting a pansy, and\r\nhe broke the news to her in much the same words. She actually laughed,\r\nand she had been almost as frightened as Cecily when he had told her of\r\nthe other Indians.\r\n\r\n'You are too killing over those Red Indians!' she said. Privately, he\r\nthought that the Red Indians would do all the killing.\r\n\r\n'You needn't laugh; it's true!' he said solemnly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, of course!' said Hilary; 'but don't come so near, or you'll upset\r\nmy glass of water.' Hilary, too, was hopeless; he was reduced to his\r\nlast cards now, and came in upon Mrs. Jolliffe as she sat at her\r\nwriting-table. She looked up with a sweet, vague smile.\r\n\r\n'What is it now, dear boy?' she asked. 'I hope you are managing to amuse\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\n'I think I ought to tell you,' he said thickly, 'that a tribe of\r\nBogallala Indians are going to storm our encampment this evening.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mrs. Jolliffe was getting a little bored with military topics.\r\n'Yes, yes,' she said absently, 'that will be very nice, I'm sure. Don't\r\nbe too late in coming in, there's good boys.'\r\n\r\n'You don't _mind_ our being there?--there will be danger!' he said with\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n'Mind? Not in the very least, so long as you are enjoying yourself,' she\r\nsaid kindly.\r\n\r\nThere went one card: he had but one more. 'Could you let Corklett and\r\nGeorge' (they were the butler and page respectively) 'come down to the\r\ncamp about half-past eight? We should be so much safer if we had them\r\nwith us.'\r\n\r\n'What are you thinking of, Clarence? We dine at eight, remember; how can\r\nI send either of them down then? You really must be reasonable.'\r\n\r\nClarence was by no means an ill-mannered boy in general, but fear made\r\nhim insolent at this.\r\n\r\n'Of course, if you think your dinner is more important than us!' he\r\nburst out hotly.\r\n\r\n'Clarence, I can't allow you to speak to me in that way. It is\r\nridiculous for you to expect me to alter my arrangements to suit your\r\nconvenience,' said Mrs. Jolliffe; 'leave the room, or I shall be really\r\nangry with you. I don't wish to hear any more--go.'\r\n\r\nHe went with a swelling heart, and in the garden he met Cecily. If he\r\ncould only induce her to beg him not to risk his life again! He\r\ndisclosed the situation as impressively as he could; but, alas! Cecily\r\nseemed perfectly tranquil.\r\n\r\n'I'm not a bit afraid this time,' she said, 'because you beat them so\r\neasily before; there's only one thing, Clarence. You know I daren't lock\r\nthe army in again--they've made it up; but they _were_ so cross over it!\r\nSo I want you to promise to look after them.'\r\n\r\n'I shall have enough to do to look after myself, I expect,' he answered\r\nroughly; 'you don't know what these Indians are.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, but I do, Clarence; I saw them at the \"Wild West.\" I thought they\r\nlooked rather nice then. And you know you frightened them so before. You\r\nare so awfully brave--aren't you?'\r\n\r\n'I--I don't think I feel quite so awfully brave as I did then,' he\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but you will. Jack and Guy will be quite safe with you. Good-bye;\r\nI'm going to get some mulberry-leaves for my silkworms.' And she ran off\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nIt was his hard fate that everybody persisted in treating the affair in\r\none of two ways--either they looked upon it as part of the army game, or\r\nelse considered him such a champion, on the strength of his past\r\nexploits, that there was practically no danger even if a whole tribe of\r\nRedskins came to attack him.\r\n\r\nLuncheon that day was a terrible meal for him. Uncle Lambert (though he\r\nwas too great a coward to go near the fight himself) seemed very anxious\r\nthat the defenders should be in good condition. 'Give yourself a\r\nchance, General,' he would say; 'another slice of this roly-poly pudding\r\nmay just turn the scale between you and Yellow Vulture. Look at the\r\narmy--they're victualling for a regular siege!'\r\n\r\nBut Clarence was quite unable to follow their example; he was annoyed\r\nwith them for what he considered was 'showing off'--though he might have\r\nreflected that to consume three helpings of jam-and-suet in rapid\r\nsuccession was an almost impossible form of bravado.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the afternoon he spent in trying to lower the army's\r\nconfidence by telling all the gruesome stories of Indian warfare he\r\ncould think of; but he frightened himself a great deal more than them,\r\nand at last had to abandon the attempt in despair.\r\n\r\nFor Jack and Guy had no nerves to speak of; they were eager to clear\r\ntheir tarnished reputation, and the possibility of harm coming to them\r\ndid not seem to present itself. They had formed rather a poor opinion of\r\nBuffalo Bill's Indians, whose yell turned out to be very little more\r\nthan short yelps, and who ran away directly a Cowboy showed his nose.\r\nHadn't Clarence defeated them with ease already? What Clarence had done\r\nalone they surely could do together, and then they had an unbounded\r\nbelief in the impregnable character of their stockade.\r\n\r\nTinling found that he could not undeceive them without exposing himself,\r\nwhich he would still rather die than do, and he roamed about the\r\ngrounds, making a little mental calculation whenever a clock struck in\r\nthe heavy afternoon stillness: 'In so many hours from this I shall be\r\nfighting hand-to-hand with real Indians!'\r\n\r\nThen at tea-time he thought (for the first time) the smell of cake quite\r\ndetestable, and he hardly knew how he forced himself to sit quietly on\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n'General Tinling,' said Uncle Lambert, 'before you, so to speak, \"go to\r\nthe front\" and occupy the post of danger, will you oblige me by drawing\r\nup the troops before the verandah? I should like, though unable to\r\naccompany you myself, to say a few words of farewell.'\r\n\r\nClarence sulkily acquiesced, and Lambert Jolliffe addressed the army:\r\n'Soldiers,' he said, 'a great responsibility rests upon you this day.\r\nYou are expected solemnly and earnestly to strive your utmost _not_ to\r\n\r\n\r\n     Let the red man dance\r\n     By _our_ red cedar tree,\r\n\r\n\r\nto quote (with a trifling variation) from Tennyson's \"Maud.\" For myself,\r\nI have no fears of the result. Under the leadership of your veteran\r\nGeneral, victory must infallibly crown your arms. We peaceful civilians\r\nshall rest secure in the absolute confidence such protection inspires,\r\nand be the first to welcome your triumphant return. Should your hearts\r\nfail you at any moment, I have already instructed you how to act. To\r\nthe Commander himself I should consider the mere suggestion an\r\nimpertinence. Go, then, devoted spirits, where Glory leads, and\r\nendeavour to avoid the indignity of scalping--if only for the sake of\r\nappearances. Soldiers, I have done. May the God of Battles (I need\r\nhardly explain to scholars that I refer to Mars) keep his eye on you!'\r\n\r\nHazel and Hilary were also on the verandah, and used their handkerchiefs\r\nfreely--but principally to conceal their mouths. 'They'll be sorry they\r\nlaughed by-and-by;' thought Clarence; 'they'll wish they had cried just\r\na little, perhaps!'--a reflection the pathos of which very nearly made\r\nhim cry himself, as he marched down to the stockade, feeling distinctly\r\nunwell.\r\n\r\nBefore he entered the fort he tore down the fatal notices. 'What's the\r\ngood of that?' asked Guy.\r\n\r\n'Well, the Indians have seen 'em,' said the General.\r\n\r\n'But they'll think we want to back out of it,' objected Jack.\r\n\r\n'Let them think!' was the bold retort.\r\n\r\nInside the fort Jack and Guy set to work in the highest spirits to\r\nbarricade the entrance with wheelbarrows and an old mowing-machine; then\r\nthey lit the lantern, and polished their guns, sharpened their swords,\r\nand looked to the springs of their pistols for about the hundredth time.\r\n\r\n'I say, this would jolly well pepper a Red Indian, wouldn't it!' cried\r\nGuy, showing a pistol, the tiny barrel of which was constructed to\r\ndischarge swanshot with a steel watch-spring.\r\n\r\n'I tell you what,' said Jack, with the air of a trapper, 'I shall\r\nreserve my peas till I've fired away all the corks, and take a\r\ndeliberate aim each time.'\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to persuade them that these missiles would not be\r\naccepted as deadly by savages, who of course would know no better; and\r\nagain, had not the first victory been won by these simple means?\r\n\r\nSo General Tinling held his peace, and the western sky slowly changed\r\nfrom crocus to green, and from green to deep violet, and the evening\r\nstar lighted its steady golden fire, the grasshoppers set up a louder\r\nchirp, a bat executed complicated figures overhead, and the boys\r\nunconsciously began to speak in whispers.\r\n\r\n'It's getting too dark to see much with this telescope,' said Jack, 'I\r\nwish we had a night-glass. The Indians ought to be here by this\r\ntime--they said \"sunset,\" didn't they? If I _was_ a Red Indian I would\r\nbe punctual! When do you suppose they'll come, Clarence--soon?'\r\n\r\n'How on earth do I know?' snapped the General from within the tent.\r\n\r\n'Well, you needn't get in a bait over it. How did they come on the first\r\ntime--did they crawl along like snakes till they were quite near, and\r\nthen give a yell and rush at the stockade?'\r\n\r\n'I forget what they did--don't bother me!'\r\n\r\n'I suppose they'll all have tomahawks,' said Guy. 'Clarence, does\r\nscalping hurt?'\r\n\r\nThere was a slight convulsion inside the tent, but no answer.\r\n\r\n'I wonder if the Bogallala torture prisoners,' Jack observed; 'I don't\r\nthink I could stand _that_.'\r\n\r\nThe General came to the tent-door at this: 'Can't you fellows shut up?'\r\nhe said fiercely. 'They'll hear you!'\r\n\r\n'They're not here yet--we shall know when they come, by the\r\nsignalling--let's all keep quite quiet for a minute or two.'\r\n\r\nThere was a breathless interval of silence. At last Jack said: 'I hear\r\nsomething--a sort of low grunting noise, like pigs.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it is the pigs at the farm,' suggested Guy.\r\n\r\n'Indians can imitate all kinds of birds, I know,' reasoned Jack, not\r\ndirectly to the point, perhaps, but he was getting excited.\r\n\r\nTinling felt a dull rage against the other two. How dared they pretend\r\nnot to be afraid? It was all swagger--he knew that very well. Various\r\nunpleasant recollections began to rise in his mind. He remembered how\r\nthat Indian spy had stalked the settler's cabin at Earl's Court. He\r\ncould see him now, stealing over the sand, then listening with his ear\r\nto the ground, and turning to beckon on the ambushed warriors. He even\r\nremembered the way the yellow and red striped blinds of the log hut\r\nflapped in the wind, and how the horse that was hobbled outside raised\r\nhis head from his hay, and pricked his ears uneasily, as the foe came\r\ngliding nearer and nearer. Then their way of fighting--he had thought it\r\nrather comic _then_--they hopped and pranced about like so many lively\r\nfrogs, but the butchery would not be rendered any more agreeable by\r\nbeing accompanied by laughable gestures! And there was an almost naked\r\nlight-yellow savage, whom he recalled dancing the war dance--he tried\r\nnot to think of all this, but it came vividly before him.\r\n\r\n'S-s-h--_Cave_!' cried Guy, suddenly, as he looked through the loophole;\r\n'I can see just the top of one's head and feathers among the currant\r\nbushes. I'll touch him up in a second.'\r\n\r\nHe raised his tiny spring pistol, and was just aiming, when Tinling,\r\nalmost beside himself, darted on him, and struck it out of his hand.\r\n'What are you doing now?' he said, through his teeth. 'What is the good\r\nof _irritating_ them?'\r\n\r\n'Why, they _are_ irritated,' said Guy, 'or they wouldn't come.'\r\n\r\n'If they are,' retorted Clarence, raising his voice, 'whose doing was\r\nit? You can't say I had anything to do with putting up those defiances!\r\nHaven't I always said I respected Red men? They've got feelings like us.\r\nWhen you go and insult them, of course they get annoyed--who wouldn't, I\r\nshould like to know? I honour a chief like Yellow Vulture myself, and I\r\ndon't care if he hears me say so. I say I honour him!'\r\n\r\nHis voice rose almost to a scream as he concluded.\r\n\r\n'I say, Tinling, I do believe you're in a funk!' said Guy, after a\r\nmoment of wondering silence.\r\n\r\n'If you are, say so, and we shall know what to do,' added Jack, feeling\r\nin his pocket. 'Are you?'\r\n\r\n'Feel his hands,' suggested Guy.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' said Clarence, dashing aside the obstacles before the door,\r\n'I'm not going to stay here to be treated in this way. If it hadn't been\r\nfor your foolery in sticking up the notices we should have been friends\r\nwith the Indians now. I don't want to quarrel with any Bogallala. And\r\nyou have the cheek to ask me if I'm in a funk, and to want to feel my\r\nhands. Well, it just serves you right--I'm going.'\r\n\r\n'Well, go then; who wants you?' said Guy.\r\n\r\nBut softer-hearted Jack said, 'Clarence, you mustn't. You'll be safe in\r\nhere; but out there----'\r\n\r\nBut the General had already vanished. He was crouching outside in the\r\nshadow of the stockade. He could not bear being penned up any longer; he\r\nmust at least have a run for his life.\r\n\r\nHad the enemy heard him declare his innocence? If so, it did not seem to\r\nhave softened them. They were still crouching--silent, hidden,\r\nrelentless--behind the currant bushes, their scouts signalling to one\r\nanother, for no _real_ grasshopper ever made so much noise as that. He\r\nmust make a bolt for it, and take his chance of their arrows missing\r\nhim. Over the open space of grey-green grass he scuttled, and actually\r\nsucceeded in reaching the friendly shadow of the holly hedge unharmed;\r\nbut that was probably because they felt so certain of cutting him off at\r\ntheir pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn tiptoe and trembling went the General along the narrow paths, green\r\nwith damp, and latticed by the shadows which branches cast in the sickly\r\nmoonlight, until--just when he was almost clear of the gloom--his knees\r\nbent under him; for there, at the end of the walk, against the starry\r\nsky, stood a towering figure, with bristling feather head-dress, and\r\ntomahawk poised.\r\n\r\n'Oh, please, sir, don't!' he faltered, and shut his eyes, expecting the\r\nIndian to bound upon him. But when he opened his eyes again, the savage\r\nwas gone! He must have slipped behind a ragged old yew which had once\r\nbeen clipped and trimmed to look like a chess-king.\r\n\r\nClarence Tinling tottered on through the shrubbery, which was full of\r\nterrors. Warriors, stealthy and cruel, lurked behind every rustling\r\nlaurel; far away on the lawn he saw their spears through the tall pampas\r\ngrass; he heard them chirping, clucking, and grunting in every direction\r\nas they lay in wait for him, until at last he gained the broad gravel\r\npath, at the end of which--oh, how far away they seemed!--were the\r\nthree lighted windows of the drawing-room. He could see the interior\r\nquite plainly, and the group round the piano where the shaded lamp made\r\na spot of brilliant colour. What were they all doing? Were they huddled\r\ntogether, waiting, watching in an agony of suspense? Nothing of the\r\nkind: it will be scarcely credited, perhaps, but this heartless domestic\r\ncircle were positively passing the time with music, as if nothing were\r\nhappening!\r\n\r\nIf only he could reach that bright drawing-room before the rush came! He\r\nfelt that there were lithe forms stealing along behind the flower-beds.\r\nHe dared not run, but dragged his heavy feet along the gravel; and then,\r\nall at once, from the rhododendron bushes rose a wild, unearthly yell.\r\nHe could bear it no longer; he would make one last effort, even if they\r\ntomahawked him on the very verandah.\r\n\r\nSomehow--he never knew how--he found himself in the midst of that quiet\r\nmusical party, wild with terror, scarcely able to speak.\r\n\r\n'The Red Indians!' he gasped. 'Don't let them get me! Save me--hide me\r\nsomewhere!' and he remembered afterwards that he made a mad endeavour to\r\nget inside the piano.\r\n\r\nHe was instantly surrounded by the astonished family. 'My dear\r\nClarence,' said Mrs. Jolliffe, 'you're perfectly safe--you've been\r\nfrightening yourself with your own game. There are no Indians here.'\r\n\r\nAnother howl from the shrubbery seemed to contradict her. 'There,\r\ndidn't you hear that?' he cried. 'Oh, you won't believe me till it's too\r\nlate! There are hundreds of them round the stockade. They may have\r\nscalped Jack and Guy by this time!'\r\n\r\n'And why ain't you being scalped too?' inquired Uncle Lambert.\r\n\r\n'I'm sure you needn't talk!' he retorted; 'you weren't any more anxious\r\nto fight than I am.'\r\n\r\n'But isn't that different? I thought you had fought them before, and\r\nconquered?'\r\n\r\n'Then you thought wrong! Those--those weren't real Indians--I made them\r\nup, then!'\r\n\r\n'Now we've got it!' said Uncle Lambert. 'Well, Master Clarence, you've\r\nmade your little confession, and now it's my turn--_I_ made Yellow\r\nVulture up!'\r\n\r\n'Are you sure--really sure--on your honour?' he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n'Honest Injun!' said Lambert. 'You see, I began to think the military\r\nbusiness was getting rather overdone; the army, like Wordsworth's world,\r\nwas \"too much with us,\" and it occurred to me to see whether the\r\nGeneral's courage would stand an outside test--so I composed that little\r\nchallenge. Yes, you see before you the only Wah Na Sa Pash Boo--no\r\nothers are genuine!'\r\n\r\nTinling felt that those girls were laughing at him; they had probably\r\nbeen in the secret for some time; but he could not care much just\r\nthen--the relief was so delicious!\r\n\r\n'It was too bad of you, Lambert,' said Mrs. Jolliffe. 'He was really\r\nhorribly frightened, and there are those other two down in the stockade\r\nall alone--you might have thought of that--they will be half out of\r\ntheir minds by this time!'\r\n\r\n'My dear Cecilia,' was the reply,'don't be uneasy, I _did_ think of it.\r\nThe moment they begin to feel at all uncomfortable they have directions\r\nto open a certain packet which explains the whole thing. If the gallant\r\nGeneral had not been in quite such a hurry, he would have spared himself\r\nthis unpleasant experience.'\r\n\r\n'Let's all go down, and see how they're getting on,' said Hazel.\r\n\r\n'I know this,' said the General sullenly, 'they were in quite as big a\r\nfunk as I was!'\r\n\r\n'Then why didn't they run in, and ask to be hidden too?' inquired\r\nHilary.\r\n\r\n'Why? Because they didn't dare!' retorted Tinling, boldly.\r\n\r\n'You know,' he remarked to Cecily, as they were going down together\r\nthrough the warm darkness, 'it's not fair of your uncle to play these\r\ntricks on fellows.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it isn't quite,' said Cecily, impartially; 'but then he didn't\r\n_begin_, did he?'\r\n\r\n'Ahoy!' shouted Uncle Lambert, as they neared the stockade, and he was\r\nanswered by a ringing cheer from the fortress.\r\n\r\n'Come on--we ain't afraid of you! Don't skulk there--see what you'll\r\nget!' And a volley of peas, corks, and small shot flew about their ears.\r\n\r\nLambert Jolliffe ran forward: 'Hi, stop that! spare our lives!' he\r\ncried, laughing. 'Jack, you young rascal, put down that confounded\r\npopgun--can't you see we're not Red Indians?'\r\n\r\n'What, is it you, uncle?' said Guy, in a rather crestfallen tone. 'Where\r\nare the Red Indians then?'\r\n\r\n'They had to go up to town to see their dentist. But do you mean to say\r\nyou haven't opened my envelope after all?'\r\n\r\n'I thought you told us it was only in case we got frightened?' said\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n'What does the General say to _that_?' cried Lambert--but Clarence\r\nTinling was nowhere to be found. He had slipped off to his bedroom, and\r\nthe next morning he announced at breakfast that he 'thought his people\r\nwould be wanting him at home.'\r\n\r\nSo the army was disbanded, for there was a general disarmament, and on\r\nthe afternoon after Tinling's departure the entire Jolliffe family\r\nengaged in a grand cricket match, when lazy Uncle Lambert came out\r\nunexpectedly strong as an overhand bowler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SHUT OUT_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is towards the end of an afternoon in December, and Wilfred Rolleston\r\nis walking along a crowded London street with his face turned westward.\r\nA few moments ago and he was scarcely conscious of where he was or where\r\nhe meant to go: he was walking on mechanically in a heavy stupor,\r\nthrough which there stole a haunting sense of degradation and despair\r\nthat tortured him dully. And suddenly, as if by magic, this has\r\nvanished: he seems to himself to have waked from a miserable day dream\r\nto the buoyant consciousness of youth and hope. Temperaments which are\r\nsubject to fits of heavy and causeless depression have their\r\ncompensations sometimes in the reaction which follows; the infesting\r\ncares, as in Longfellow's poem, 'fold their tents, like the Arabs, and\r\nas silently steal away,' and with their retreat comes an exquisite\r\nexhilaration which more equable dispositions can never experience.\r\n\r\nIs this so with Rolleston now? He only knows that the cloud has lifted\r\nfrom his brain, and that in the clear sunshine which bursts upon him now\r\nhe can look his sorrows in the face and know that there is nothing so\r\nterrible in them after all.\r\n\r\nIt is true that he is not happy at the big City day school which he has\r\njust left. How should he be? He is dull and crabbed and uncouth, and\r\nknows too well that he is an object of general dislike; no one there\r\ncares to associate with him, and he makes no attempt to overcome their\r\nprejudices, being perfectly aware that they are different from him, and\r\nhating them for it, but hating himself, perhaps, the most.\r\n\r\nAnd though all his evenings are spent at home there is little rest for\r\nhim even there, for the work for the next day must be prepared; and he\r\nsits over it till late, sometimes with desperate efforts to master the\r\ndifficulties, but more often staring at the page before him with eyes\r\nthat are almost wilfully vacant.\r\n\r\nAll this has been and is enough in itself to account for the gloomy\r\nstate into which he had sunk. But--and how could he have forgotten\r\nit?--it is over for the present.\r\n\r\nTo-night he will not have to sit up struggling with the tasks which will\r\nonly cover him with fresh disgrace on the morrow; for a whole month he\r\nneed not think of them, nor of the classes in which the hand of everyone\r\nis against him. For the holidays have begun; to-day has been the last of\r\nthe term. Is there no reason for joy and thankfulness in that? What a\r\nfool he has been to let those black thoughts gain such a hold over him!\r\n\r\nSlowly, more as if it had all happened a long time ago instead of quite\r\nrecently, the incidents of the morning come back to him, vivid and clear\r\nonce more--morning chapel and the Doctor's sermon, and afterwards the\r\npretence of work and relaxed discipline in the class rooms, when the\r\nresults of the examinations had been read out, with the names of the\r\nboys who had gained prizes and their remove to the form above. He had\r\ncome out last of course, but no one expected anything else from him; a\r\nlaugh had gone round the desks when his humble total closed the list,\r\nand he had joined in it to show them he didn't care. And then the class\r\nhad been dismissed, and there had been friendly good-byes, arrangements\r\nfor walking home in company or for meeting during the holidays--for all\r\nbut him; he had gone out alone--and the dull blankness had come over him\r\nfrom which he has only just recovered.\r\n\r\nBut, for the present at all events, he has got rid of it completely; he\r\nis going home, where at least he is not despised, where he will find a\r\nsanctuary from gibes and jostlings and impositions; and the longer he\r\nthinks of this the higher his spirits rise, and he steps briskly, with a\r\nkind of exultation, until the people he passes in the streets turn and\r\nlook at him, struck by his expression. 'They can see how jolly I'm\r\nfeeling,' he thinks with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe dusk is falling, and the shops he passes are brilliant with lights\r\nand decorations, but he does not stop to look at any of them; his mind\r\nis busy with settling how he shall employ himself on this the first\r\nevening of his liberty, the first for so long on which he could feel his\r\nown master.\r\n\r\nAt first he decides to read. Is there not some book he had begun and\r\nmeant to finish, so many days ago now that he has even forgotten what it\r\nwas all about, and only remembers that it was exciting?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, he thinks, he won't read to-night--not on the very first night\r\nof the holidays. Quite lately--yesterday or the day before--his mother\r\nhad spoken to him, gently but very seriously, about what she called the\r\nmorose and savage fits which would bring misery upon him if he did not\r\nset himself earnestly to overcome them.\r\n\r\nAnd there were times, he knew, when it seemed as if a demon possessed\r\nhim and drove him to wound even those who loved him and whom he\r\nloved--times when their affection only roused in him some hideous spirit\r\nof sullen contradiction.\r\n\r\nHe feels softened now somehow, and has a new longing for the love he has\r\nso often harshly repulsed. He _will_ overcome this sulkiness of his; he\r\nwill begin this very evening; as soon as he gets home he will tell his\r\nmother that he is sorry, that he does love her really, only that when\r\nthese fits come on him he hardly knows what he says or does.\r\n\r\nAnd she will forgive him, only too gladly; and his mind will be quite at\r\nease again. No, not quite; there is still something he must do before\r\nthat: he has a vague recollection of a long-standing coolness between\r\nhimself and his younger brother, Lionel. They never have got on very\r\nwell together; Lionel is so different--much cleverer even already, for\r\none thing; better looking too, and better tempered. Whatever they\r\nquarrelled about Wilfred is very sure that he was the offender; Lionel\r\nnever begins that kind of thing. But he will put himself in the right at\r\nonce, and ask Lionel to make friends again; he will consent readily\r\nenough--he always does.\r\n\r\nAnd then he has a bright idea: he will take his brother some little\r\npresent to prove that he really wishes to behave decently for the\r\nfuture. What shall he buy?\r\n\r\nHe finds himself near a large toy shop at the time, and in the window\r\nare displayed several regiments of brightly coloured tin warriors--the\r\nvery thing! Lionel is still young enough to delight in them.\r\n\r\nFeeling in his pockets, Rolleston discovers more loose silver than he\r\nhad thought he possessed, and so he goes into the shop and asks for one\r\nof the boxes of soldiers. He is served by one of two neatly dressed\r\nfemale assistants, who stare and giggle at one another at his first\r\nwords, finding it odd, perhaps, that a fellow of his age should buy\r\ntoys--as if, he thinks indignantly, they couldn't see that it was not\r\nfor _himself_ he wanted the things.\r\n\r\nBut he goes on, feeling happier after his purchase. They will see now\r\nthat he is not so bad after all. It is long since he has felt such a\r\ncraving to be thought well of by somebody.\r\n\r\nA little farther on he comes to a row of people, mostly women and\r\ntradesmen's boys, standing on the curb stone opposite a man who is\r\nseated in a little wooden box on wheels drawn up close to the pavement.\r\nHe is paralytic and blind, with a pinched white face framed in an\r\nold-fashioned fur cap with big ear lappets; he seems to be preaching or\r\nreading, and Rolleston stops idly enough to listen for a few moments,\r\nthe women making room for him with alacrity, and the boys staring\r\ncuriously round at the new arrival with a grin.\r\n\r\nHe hardly pays much attention to this; he is listening to the poem which\r\nthe man in the box is reciting with a nasal and metallic snuffle in his\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\r\n     There's a harp _and_ a crown,\r\n       For you and _for_ me,\r\n     Hanging on the boughs\r\n       Of that Christmas tree!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe hears, and then hurries on again, repeating the stanza mechanically\r\nto himself, without seeing anything particularly ludicrous about it. The\r\nwords have reminded him of that Christmas party at the Gordons', next\r\ndoor. Did not Ethel Gordon ask him particularly to come, and did he not\r\nrefuse her sullenly? What a brute he was to treat her like that! If she\r\nwere to ask him again, he thinks he would not say no, though he does\r\nhate parties.\r\n\r\nEthel is a dear girl, and never seems to think him good-for-nothing, as\r\nmost people do. Perhaps it is sham though--no, he can't think that when\r\nhe remembers how patiently and kindly she has borne with his senseless\r\nfits of temper and tried to laugh away his gloom.\r\n\r\nNot every girl as pretty as Ethel is would care to notice him, and\r\npersist in it in spite of everything; yet he has sulked with her of\r\nlate. Was it because she had favoured Lionel? He is ashamed to think\r\nthat this may have been the reason.\r\n\r\nNever mind, that is all over now; he will start clear with everybody. He\r\nwill ask Ethel, too, to forgive him. Is there nothing he can do to\r\nplease her? Yes some time ago she had asked him to draw something for\r\nher. (He detests drawing lessons, but he has rather a taste for drawing\r\nthings out of his own head.) He had told her, not too civilly, that he\r\nhad work enough without doing drawings for girls. He will paint her\r\nsomething to-night as a surprise; he will begin as soon as tea is\r\ncleared away; it will be more sociable than reading a book.\r\n\r\nAnd then already he sees a vision of the warm little panelled room, and\r\nhimself getting out his colour-box and sitting down to paint by\r\nlamp-light--for any light does for his kind of colouring--while his\r\nmother sits opposite and Lionel watches the picture growing under his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWhat shall he draw? He gets quite absorbed in thinking over this; his\r\nown tastes run in a gory direction, but perhaps Ethel, being a girl, may\r\nnot care for battles or desperate duels. A compromise strikes him; he\r\nwill draw a pirate ship: that will be first rate, with the black flag\r\nflying on the mainmast, and the pirate captain on the poop scouring the\r\nocean with a big glass in search of merchantmen; all about the deck and\r\nrigging he can put the crew, with red caps, and belts stuck full of\r\npistols and daggers.\r\n\r\nAnd on the right there shall be a bit of the pirate island, with a mast\r\nand another black flag--he knows he will enjoy picking out the skull and\r\ncross-bones in thick Chinese white--and then, if there is room, he will\r\nadd a cannon, and perhaps a palm tree. A pirate island always has palm\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nHe is so full of this projected picture of his that he is quite\r\nsurprised to find that he is very near the square where he lives; but\r\nhere, just in front of him, at the end of the narrow lane, is the\r\npublic-house with the coach and four engraved on the ground glass of the\r\nlower part of the window, and above it the bottles full of coloured\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the greengrocer's. How long is it since it was a\r\nbarber's?--surely a very little time. And there is the bootmaker's, with\r\nits outside display of dangling shoes, and the row of naked gas jets\r\nblown to pale blue specks and whistling red tongues by turns as a gust\r\nsweeps across them.\r\n\r\nThis is his home, this little dingy, old-fashioned red-brick house at an\r\nangle of the square, with a small paved space railed in before it. He\r\npushes open the old gate with the iron arch above, where an oil-lamp\r\nused to hang, and hurries up to the door with the heavy shell-shaped\r\nporch, impatient to get to the warmth and light which await him within.\r\n\r\nThe bell has got out of order, for only a faint jangle comes from below\r\nas he rings; he waits a little and then pulls the handle again, more\r\nsharply this time, and still no one comes.\r\n\r\nWhen Betty does think proper to come up and open the door he will tell\r\nher that it is too bad keeping a fellow standing out here, in the fog\r\nand cold, all this time.... She is coming at last--no, it was fancy; it\r\nseems as if Betty had slipped out for something, and perhaps the cook is\r\nupstairs, and his mother may be dozing by the fire, as she has begun to\r\ndo of late.\r\n\r\nLosing all patience, he gropes for the knocker, and, groping in vain,\r\nbegins to hammer with bare fists on the door, louder and louder, until\r\nhe is interrupted by a rough voice from the railings behind him.\r\n\r\n'Now then, what are you up to there, eh?' says the voice, which belongs\r\nto a burly policeman who has stopped suspiciously on the pavement.\r\n\r\n'Why,' says Rolleston, 'I want to get in, and I can't make them hear me.\r\nI wish you'd try what you can do, will you?'\r\n\r\nThe policeman comes slowly in to the gate. 'I dessay,' he says\r\njocularly. 'Is there anythink else? Come, suppose you move on.'\r\n\r\nA curious kind of dread of he knows not what begins to creep over\r\nWilfred at this.\r\n\r\n'Move on?' he cries, '_why_ should I move on? This is my house; don't\r\nyou see? I live here.'\r\n\r\n'Now look 'ere, my joker, I don't want a job over this,' says the\r\nconstable, stolidly. 'You'll bring a crowd round in another minute if\r\nyou keep on that 'ammering.'\r\n\r\n'Mind your own business,' says the other with growing excitement.\r\n\r\n'That's what you'll make me do if you don't look out,' is the retort.\r\n'Will you move on before I make you?'\r\n\r\n'But, I say,' protests Rolleston, 'I'm not joking; I give you my word\r\nI'm not. I do live here. Why, I've just come back from school, and I\r\ncan't get in.'\r\n\r\n'Pretty school _you_ come from!' growls the policeman; ''andles on to\r\n_your_ lesson books, if _I_ knows anything. 'Ere, out you go!'\r\n\r\nRolleston's fear increases. 'I won't! I won't!' he cries frantically,\r\nand rushing back to the door beats upon it wildly. On the other side of\r\nit are love and shelter, and it will not open to him. He is cold and\r\nhungry and tired after his walk; why do they keep him out like this?\r\n\r\n'Mother!' he calls hoarsely. 'Can't you hear me, mother? It's Wilfred;\r\nlet me in!'\r\n\r\nThe other takes him, not roughly, by the shoulder. 'Now you take my\r\nadvice,' he says. 'You ain't quite yourself; you're making a mistake. I\r\ndon't want to get you in trouble if you don't force me to it. Drop this\r\n'ere tomfool game and go home quiet to wherever it is you _do_ live.'\r\n\r\n'I tell you I live here, you fool!' shrieks Wilfred, in deadly terror\r\nlest he should be forced away before the door is opened.\r\n\r\n'And I tell you you don't do nothing of the sort,' says the policeman,\r\nbeginning to lose his temper. 'No one don't live 'ere, nor ain't done\r\nnot since I've bin on the beat. Use your eyes if you're not too far\r\ngone.'\r\n\r\nFor the first time Rolleston seems to see things plainly as they are; he\r\nglances round the square--that is just as it always is on foggy winter\r\nevenings, with its central enclosure a shadowy black patch against a\r\nreddish glimmer, beyond which the lighted windows of the houses make\r\nyellow bars of varying length and tint.\r\n\r\nBut this house, his own--why, it is all shuttered and dark; some of the\r\nwindow panes are broken; there is a pale grey patch in one that looks\r\nlike a dingy bill; the knocker has been unscrewed from the door, and on\r\nits scraped panels someone has scribbled words and rough caricatures\r\nthat were surely not there when he left that morning.\r\n\r\nCan anything--any frightful disaster--have come in that short time? No,\r\nhe will not think of it; he will not let himself be terrified, all for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n'Now, are you goin'?' says the policeman after a pause.\r\n\r\nRolleston puts his back against the door and clings to the sides. 'No!'\r\nhe shouts. 'I don't care what you say; I don't believe you: they are all\r\nin there--they are, I tell you, they are--they _are_!'\r\n\r\nIn a second he is in the constable's strong grasp and being dragged,\r\nstruggling violently, to the gate, when a soft voice, a woman's,\r\nintercedes for him.\r\n\r\n'What is the matter? Oh, don't--don't be so rough with him, poor\r\ncreature!' it cries pitifully.\r\n\r\n'I'm only exercisin' my duty, mum,' says the officer; 'he wants to\r\ncreate a disturbance 'ere.'\r\n\r\n'No,' cries Wilfred, 'he lies! I only want to get into my own house, and\r\nno one seems to hear me. _You_ don't think anything is the matter, do\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\nIt is a lady who has been pleading for him; as he wrests himself from\r\nhis captor and comes forward she sees his face, and her own grows white\r\nand startled.\r\n\r\n'Wilfred!' she exclaims.\r\n\r\n'Why, you know my name!' he says. 'Then you can tell him it's all\r\nright. Do I know you? You speak like--is it--_Ethel_?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she says, and her voice is low and trembling, 'I am Ethel.'\r\n\r\nHe is silent for an instant; then he says slowly, 'You are not the\r\nsame--nothing is the same: it is all changed--changed--and oh, my God,\r\nwhat am _I_?'\r\n\r\nSlowly the truth is borne in upon his brain, muddled and disordered by\r\nlong excess, and the last shred of the illusion which had possessed him\r\ndrifts away.\r\n\r\nHe knows now that his boyhood, with such possibilities of happiness as\r\nit had ever held, has gone for ever. He has been knocking at a door\r\nwhich will open for him never again, and the mother by whose side his\r\nevening was to have been passed died long long years ago.\r\n\r\nThe past, blotted out completely for an hour by some freak of the\r\nmemory, comes back to him, and he sees his sullen, morbid boyhood\r\nchanging into something worse still, until by slow degrees he became\r\nwhat he is now--dissipated, degraded, lost.\r\n\r\nAt first the shock, the awful loneliness he awakes to, and the shame of\r\nbeing found thus by the woman for whom he had felt the only pure love he\r\nhad known, overwhelm him utterly, and he leans his head upon his arms as\r\nhe clutches the railings, and sobs with a grief that is terrible in its\r\nutter abandonment.\r\n\r\nThe very policeman is silent and awed by what he feels to be a scene\r\nfrom the human tragedy, though he may not be able to describe it to\r\nhimself by any more suitable phrase than 'a rum start.'\r\n\r\n'You can go now, policeman,' says the lady, putting money in his hand.\r\n'You see I know this--this gentleman. Leave him to me; he will give you\r\nno trouble now.'\r\n\r\nAnd the constable goes, taking care, however, to keep an eye\r\noccasionally on the corner where this has taken place. He has not gone\r\nlong before Rolleston raises his head with a husky laugh: his manner has\r\nchanged now; he is no longer the boy in thought and expression that he\r\nwas a short time before, and speaks as might be expected from his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n'I remember it all now,' he says. 'You are Ethel Gordon, of course you\r\nare, and you wouldn't have anything to do with me--and quite right\r\ntoo--and then you married my brother Lionel. You see I'm as clear as a\r\nbell again now. So you came up and found me battering at the old door,\r\neh? Do you know, I got the fancy I was a boy again and coming home\r\nto--bah, what does all that matter? Odd sort of fancy though, wasn't it?\r\nDrink is always playing me some cursed trick now. A pretty fool I must\r\nhave made of myself!'\r\n\r\nShe says nothing, and he thrusts his hands deep in his ragged pockets.\r\n'Hallo! what's this I've got?' he says, as he feels something at the\r\nbottom of one of them, and, bringing out the box of soldiers he had\r\nbought half an hour before, he holds it up with a harsh laugh which has\r\nthe ring of despair in it.\r\n\r\n'Do you see this?' he says to her. 'You'll laugh when I tell you it's a\r\ntoy I bought just now for--guess whom--for your dear husband! Must have\r\nbeen pretty bad, mustn't I? Shall I give it to you to take to him--no?\r\nWell, perhaps he has outgrown such things now, so here goes!' and he\r\npitches the box over the railings, and it falls with a shiver of broken\r\nglass as the pieces of painted tin rattle out upon the flag-stones.\r\n\r\n'And now I'll wish you good evening,' he says, sweeping off his battered\r\nhat with mock courtesy.\r\n\r\nShe tries to keep him back. 'No, Wilfred, no; you must not go like that.\r\nWe live here still, Lionel and I, in the same old house,' and she\r\nindicates the house next door; 'he will be home very soon. Will you'\r\n(she cannot help a little shudder at the thought of such a guest)--'will\r\nyou come in and wait for him?'\r\n\r\n'Throw myself into his arms, eh?' he says. 'How delighted he would be!\r\nI'm just the sort of brother to be a credit to a highly respectable\r\nyoung barrister like him. You really think he'd like it? No; it's all\r\nright, Ethel; don't be alarmed: I was only joking. I shall never come in\r\nyour way, I promise you. I'm just going to take myself off.'\r\n\r\n'Don't say that,' she says (in spite of herself she feels relieved);\r\n'tell me--is there nothing we can do--no help we can give you?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' he answers fiercely; 'I don't want your pity. Do you think I\r\ncan't see that you wouldn't touch me with the tongs if you could help\r\nit? It's too late to snivel over me now, and I'm well enough as I am.\r\nYou leave me alone to go to the devil my own way; it's all I ask of you.\r\nGood-bye. It's Christmas, isn't it? I haven't dreamed _that_ at all\r\nevents. Well, I wish you and Lionel as merry a Christmas as I mean to\r\nhave. I can't say more than that in the way of enjoyment.'\r\n\r\nHe turns on his heel at the last words and slouches off down the narrow\r\nlane by which he had come. Ethel Rolleston stands for a while, looking\r\nafter his receding form till the fog closes round it and she can see it\r\nno more. She feels as if she had seen a ghost; and for her at least the\r\nenclosure before the deserted house next door will be haunted\r\nevermore--haunted by a forlorn and homeless figure sobbing there by the\r\nrailings.\r\n\r\nAs for the man, he goes on his way until he finds a door\r\nwhich--alas!--is not closed against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TOMMY'S HERO_\r\n\r\nA STORY FOR SMALL BOYS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the night after Tommy had been taken to his first pantomime, and\r\nhe had been lying asleep in his little bedroom (for now that he was nine\r\nhe slept in the night nursery no longer); he had been asleep, when he\r\nwas suddenly awakened by a brilliant red glare. At first he was afraid\r\nthe house was on fire, but when the red turned to a dazzling green, he\r\ngave a great gasp of delight, for he thought the transformation scene\r\nwas still going on. 'And there's all the best part still to come,' he\r\nsaid to himself.\r\n\r\nBut as he became wider awake, he saw that it was out of the question to\r\nexpect his bedroom to hold all those wonders, and he was almost\r\nsurprised to see that there was even so much as a single fairy in it. A\r\nfairy there was, nevertheless; she stood there with a star in her hair,\r\nand her dress shimmering out all around her, just as he had seen her a\r\nfew hours before, when she rose up, with little jerks, inside a great\r\ngilded shell, and spoke some poetry, which he didn't quite catch.\r\n\r\nShe spoke audibly enough now, nor was her voice so squeaky as it had\r\nsounded before. 'Little boy,' she began, 'I am the ruling genius of\r\nPantomime Fairyland. You entered my kingdom for the first time last\r\nnight--how did you enjoy yourself?'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Tommy, '_so_ much; it was splendid, thank you!'\r\n\r\nShe smiled and seemed well pleased. 'I always call to inquire on a new\r\nacquaintance,' she said. 'And so you liked our realms, as every sensible\r\nboy does? Well, Tommy, it is in my power to reward you; every night for\r\na certain time you shall see again the things you liked best. What _did_\r\nyou like best?'\r\n\r\n'The clown part,' said Tommy, promptly.\r\n\r\nFor it ought to be said here that he was a boy who had always had a\r\nleaning to the kind of practical fun which he saw carried out by the\r\nclown to a pitch of perfection which at once enchanted and humbled him.\r\nTill that harlequinade, he had thought himself a funny boy in his way,\r\nand it had surprised him that his family had not found him more amusing\r\nthan they did; but now he felt all at once that he was only a very\r\nhumble beginner, and had never understood what real fun was.\r\n\r\nFor he had not soared much above hiding behind doors, and popping out\r\nsuddenly on a passing servant, causing her to 'jump' delightfully; once,\r\nindeed, he used to be able to 'sell' his family by pretending all\r\nmanner of calamities, but they had grown so stupid lately that they\r\nnever believed a single word he said.\r\n\r\nNo, the clown would not own him as a follower: he would despise his\r\nlittle attempts at practical jokes. 'Still,' thought Tommy, 'I can try\r\nto be more like him; perhaps he will come to hear of me some day!'\r\n\r\nFor he had never met anyone he admired half so much as that clown, who\r\nwas always in a good temper (to be sure he had everything his own\r\nway--but then he deserved to), always quick and ready with his excuses;\r\nand if he did run away in times of danger, it was not because he was\r\nreally afraid! Then how deliciously impudent he was to shopkeepers! Who\r\nbut he would have dared to cheapen a large fish by making a door mat of\r\nit, or to ask the prices of cheeses on purpose to throw mud at them? Not\r\nthat he couldn't be serious when he chose--for once he unfurled a Union\r\nJack and said something quite noble, which made everybody clap their\r\nhands for two minutes; and he told people the best shops to go to for a\r\nquantity of things, and he could not have been joking _then_, for they\r\nwere the same names that were to be seen on all the hoardings.\r\n\r\nThis will explain how it was natural that Tommy, on being asked which\r\npart of the pantomime he preferred, should say, without the slightest\r\nhesitation, 'Oh, the _clown_ part!'\r\n\r\nThe fairy seemed less pleased. 'The clown part!' she repeated. 'What,\r\nthose shop scenes tacked on right at the end without rhyme or reason?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Tommy, 'those ones!'\r\n\r\n'And the great wood with the shifting green and violet lights, and the\r\nwhite bands of fairies dancing in circles--didn't you like them?'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' said the candid Tommy; 'pretty well. I didn't care much for\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' she said, 'but you liked the grand processions, with all their\r\ngorgeous dresses and monstrous figures, surely you liked _them_?'\r\n\r\n'There was such a lot of it,' said Tommy. 'The clown was the best.'\r\n\r\n'And if you could, you'd rather see those last scenes again than all the\r\nrest?' she said, frowning a little.\r\n\r\n'Oh, wouldn't I just!' said Tommy; 'but may I--really and truly?'\r\n\r\n'I see you are not one of _my_ boys,' said the Genius of Pantomime,\r\nrather sadly. 'It so happens that those closing scenes are the very ones\r\nI have least control over--they are a part of my kingdom which has\r\nfallen into sad decay and rebellion. But one thing, O Tommy, I _can_ do\r\nfor you. I will give you the clown for a friend and companion--and much\r\ngood may he do you!'\r\n\r\n'But would he _come_?' he asked, hardly daring to believe in such\r\ncondescension.\r\n\r\n'He must, if _I_ bid him; it is for you to make him feel comfortable\r\nand at home with you;--the longer you can keep him the better I shall be\r\npleased.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, _how_ kind of you!' he cried; 'he shall stay all the holidays. I'd\r\nrather have him than anybody else. What fun we shall have--what fun!'\r\n\r\nThe green fire faded out and the fairy with it. He must have fallen\r\nasleep again, for, when he opened his eyes, there was the clown at the\r\nfoot of his bed making a face.\r\n\r\n''Ullo!' said the clown; 'I say, are you the nice little boy I was told\r\nto come and stay with?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' said Tommy; 'I am so glad to see you. I'm just going to get\r\nup.'\r\n\r\n'I know you are,' said the clown, and upset him out of bed into the cold\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nThis he could not help thinking a little bit unkind of the clown on such\r\na cold morning, particularly as he followed it up by throwing a\r\nhair-brush, two pieces of soap, and a pair of shoes at him before he\r\ncould get out again.\r\n\r\nBut it woke him, at all events, and he ventured (with great respect) to\r\nthrow one of the shoes back; it just grazed the clown's top-knot.\r\n\r\nTo Tommy's alarm, the clown set up a hullaballoo as if he was mortally\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n'You cruel, unkind little boy,' he sobbed, 'to play so rough with a poor\r\nclown!'\r\n\r\n'But you threw them at me first,' pleaded Tommy, 'and much harder,\r\ntoo!'\r\n\r\n'I'm the oldest,' said the clown, 'and you've got to make me feel at\r\nhome, or I shall go away again.'\r\n\r\n'I won't do it again, and I'm very sorry,' pleaded Tommy; but the clown\r\nwouldn't be friends with him for ever so long, and was only appeased at\r\nlast by being allowed to put Tommy upside down in a tall wicker basket\r\nwhich stood in a corner.\r\n\r\nThen he helped Tommy to dress by buttoning all his clothes the wrong\r\nway, and hiding his stockings and necktie. While he was doing this,\r\nSarah, the under-nurse, came in, and he strutted up to her and began to\r\ndance quietly. 'Go away, imperence,' said Sarah.\r\n\r\n'Beautiful gal,' said the clown (though Sarah was extremely plain), 'I\r\nlove yer!' and he put out his tongue and wagged his head at her until\r\nshe ran out of the room in terror.\r\n\r\nHe looked so absurd that Tommy was delighted with him again, and yet,\r\nwhen the bell rang for breakfast, he felt obliged to give his new friend\r\na hint.\r\n\r\n'I say,' he said, 'you don't mind my telling you--but mother's very\r\nparticular about manners at table;' but the clown relieved him instantly\r\nby saying that so was he--_very_ particular; and he slid down the\r\nbanisters and turned somersaults in the hall until Tommy joined him.\r\n\r\n'I do hope father and mother won't be unkind to him,' he thought, as he\r\nwent in, 'because he does seem to feel things so.'\r\n\r\nBut nothing could be more polite than the welcome Tommy's parents gave\r\nthe stranger, as he came in, bowing very low, and making a queer little\r\nskipping step. Tommy's mother said she was always glad to see any friend\r\nof her boy's, while his father begged the clown to make himself quite at\r\nhome. All _he_ said was, 'I'm disgusted to make your acquaintance;' but\r\nhe certainly made himself at home--in fact, he was not quite so\r\nparticular about his manners as he had led Tommy to expect.\r\n\r\nHe volunteered to divide the sausages and bacon himself, and did so in\r\nsuch a way that everybody else got very little and he himself got a\r\ngreat deal. If it had been anybody else, Tommy would certainly have\r\ncalled this 'piggish'; as it was, he tried to think it was all fun, and\r\nthat he himself had no particular appetite.\r\n\r\nHis cousin Barbara, a little girl of about his own age, was staying with\r\nthem just then, and came down presently to breakfast. 'Oh, my!' said the\r\nclown, laying a great red hand on his heart, 'what a nice little gal you\r\nare, ain't yer? Come and sit by me, my dear!'\r\n\r\n'No, thank you; I'm going to sit by Aunt Mary,' she replied, looking\r\nrather shy and surprised.\r\n\r\n'Allow me, missy,' he persisted, 'to pass you the strawberry-jam and\r\nthe muffins!'\r\n\r\n'I'll have some jam, thank you,' she replied.\r\n\r\nHe looked round and chuckled. 'Oh, I say; that little gal said \"thank\r\nyou\" before she got it!' he exclaimed. 'There ain't no muffins, and I've\r\neaten all the jam!' which made Tommy choke with laughter.\r\n\r\nBarbara flushed. 'That's a very stupid joke,' she pronounced severely,\r\n'and rude, too; it's a pity you weren't taught to behave better when you\r\nwere young.'\r\n\r\n'So I was!' said the clown, with his mouth full.\r\n\r\n'Then you've forgotten it,' she said; 'you're nothing but a big baby,\r\nthat you are!'\r\n\r\n'Yah!' retorted the clown; 'so are _you_ a big baby!' which, as even\r\nTommy saw, was not a very brilliant reply. It was a singular fact about\r\nthe clown that the slightest check seemed to take away all his\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\n'You know you're not telling the truth now,' said Barbara, so\r\ncontemptuously, that the clown began to weep bitterly. 'She says I don't\r\nspeak the truth!' he complained, 'and she _knows_ it will be my aunt's\r\nbirthday last Toosday!'\r\n\r\n'You great silly thing, what has that to do with it?' cried Barbara,\r\nindignantly. 'What _is_ there to cry about?' which very nearly made\r\nTommy quarrel with her, for why couldn't she be polite to _his_ friend?\r\n\r\nHowever, the clown soon dried his eyes on the tablecloth, and recovered\r\nhis cheerfulness; and presently he noticed the _Times_ lying folded by\r\nTommy's papa's plate.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say, mister,' he said, 'shall I air the newspaper for yer?'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, if you will,' was the polite reply.\r\n\r\nHe shook it all out in one great sheet and wrapped it round him, and\r\nwaddled about in it until Tommy nearly rolled off his seat with delight.\r\n\r\n'When you've _quite_ done with it----' his father was saying mildly, as\r\nthe clown made a great hole in the middle and thrust his head out of it\r\nwith a bland smile.\r\n\r\n'I'm only just looking through it,' he explained; 'you can have it now,'\r\nand he rolled it up in a tight ball and threw it at his host's head.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was certainly not such a dull meal as usual that morning,\r\nTommy thought; but he wished his people would show a little more\r\nappreciation, instead of sitting there all stiff and surprised; he was\r\nafraid the clown would feel discouraged.\r\n\r\nWhen his papa undid the ball, the paper was found to be torn into long\r\nstrips, which delighted Tommy; but his father, on the other hand, seemed\r\nannoyed, possibly because it was not so easy to read in that form.\r\nMeanwhile, the clown busied himself in emptying the butter-dish into his\r\npockets, and this did shock the boy a little, for he knew it was not\r\npolite to pocket things at meals, and wondered how he could be so nasty.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was over at last, and the clown took Tommy's arm and walked\r\nupstairs to the first floor with him.\r\n\r\n'Who's in there?' he asked, as they passed the spare bedroom.\r\n\r\n'Granny,' said the boy; 'she's staying with us; only she always has\r\nbreakfast in her room, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Why, you don't mean to say you've got a granny!' cried the clown, with\r\njoy; 'you are a nice little boy; now we'll have some fun with her.'\r\nTommy felt doubtful whether she could be induced to join them so early\r\nin the morning, and said so. 'You knock, and say you've got a present\r\nfor her if she'll come out,' suggested the clown.\r\n\r\n'But I haven't,' objected Tommy; 'wouldn't that be a story?' He had\r\nunaccountably forgotten his old fondness for 'sells.'\r\n\r\n'Of course it would,' said the clown; 'I'm always a tellin' of 'em, I\r\nam.'\r\n\r\nTommy was shocked once more, as he realised that his friend was not a\r\n_truthful_ clown. But he knocked at the door, nevertheless, and asked\r\nhis grandmother to come out and see a friend of his.\r\n\r\n'Wait one minute, my boy,' she answered, 'and I'll come out.'\r\n\r\nTommy was surprised to see his companion preparing to lie, face\r\ndownwards, on the mat just outside the door.\r\n\r\n'Get up,' he said; 'you'll trip grandma up if you stay there.'\r\n\r\n'That's what I'm doing it for, stoopid,' said the clown.\r\n\r\n'But it will hurt her,' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Nothing hurts old women,' said the clown; 'I've tripped up 'undreds of\r\n'em, and I ought to know.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you shan't trip up my granny, anyhow,' said Tommy, stoutly; for\r\nhe was not a bad-hearted boy, and his grandmother had given him a\r\nsplendid box of soldiers on Christmas Day. 'Don't come out, granny; it's\r\na mistake,' he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe clown rose with a look of disgust.\r\n\r\n'Do you call this actin' like a friend to me?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Tommy, apologetically, 'she's my granny, you see.'\r\n\r\n'She ain't _my_ granny, and, if she was, I'd let you trip her up, I\r\nwould; _I_ ain't selfish. I shan't stop with you any longer.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, do,' said Tommy; 'we'll go and play somewhere else.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said the clown, relenting, 'if you're a good boy you shall see\r\nme make a butter-slide in the hall.'\r\n\r\nThen Tommy saw how he had wronged him in thinking he had pocketed the\r\nbutter out of mere greediness, and he felt ashamed and penitent; the\r\nclown made a beautiful slide, though Tommy wished he would not insist\r\nupon putting all the butter that was left down his back.\r\n\r\n'There's a ring at the bell,' said the clown; 'I'll open the door, and\r\nyou hide and see the fun.'\r\n\r\nSo Tommy hid himself round a corner as the door opened.\r\n\r\n'Walk in, sir,' said the clown, politely.\r\n\r\n'Master Tommy in?' said a jolly, hearty voice. It was dear old Uncle\r\nJohn, who had taken him to the pantomime the night before. 'I thought\r\nI'd look in and see if he would care to come with me to the\r\nCrystal----oh!' And there was a scuffling noise and a heavy bump.\r\n\r\nTommy ran out, full of remorse. Uncle John was sitting on the tiles\r\nrubbing his head, and, oddly enough, did not look at all funny.\r\n\r\n'Oh, uncle,' cried the boy, 'you're not hurt? I didn't know it was you!'\r\n\r\n'I'm a bit shaken, my boy, that's all,' said his uncle; 'one doesn't\r\ncome down like a feather at my age.' And he picked himself slowly up.\r\n'Well, I must get home again,' he said; 'no Crystal Palace to-day,\r\nTommy, after this. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nAnd he went slowly out, leaving Tommy with the feeling that he had had\r\nenough of slides. He even wiped the flooring clean again with a\r\nwaterproof and the clothes-brush, though the clown (who had been hiding)\r\ntried to prevent him.\r\n\r\n'We ain't 'ad 'arf the fun out of it yet!' he complained (he always\r\nspoke in rather a common way, as Tommy began to notice with pain).\r\n\r\n'I've had enough,' said Tommy. 'It was my Uncle John who slipped down\r\nthat time, and he's hurt, and he'd come to take me to the Crystal\r\nPalace!'\r\n\r\n'Well, he hadn't come to take _me_,' said the clown; 'you are stingy\r\nabout your relations, you are; you ain't 'arf a boy for a bit o' fun.'\r\n\r\nTommy felt this rebuke very much, he had hoped so to gain the clown's\r\nesteem; but he would not give in, he only suggested humbly that they\r\nshould go up into the play-room.\r\n\r\nThe play-room was at the top of the house, and Barbara and two little\r\nsisters of Tommy's were playing there when they came in, the clown\r\nturning in his toes and making awful faces.\r\n\r\nThe two little girls ran into a corner, and seemed considerably\r\nfrightened by the stranger's appearance, but Barbara reassured them.\r\n\r\n'Don't take any notice,' she said, 'it's only a horrid friend of\r\nTommy's. He won't interfere with _us_.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Barbara,' the boy protested, 'he's awfully nice if you only knew\r\nhim. He can make you laugh. Do let us play with you. He wants to, and he\r\nwon't be rough.'\r\n\r\n'Do,' pleaded the clown, 'I'll behave so pretty!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Barbara, 'mind you do, then, or you shan't stop.'\r\n\r\nAnd for a little while he did behave himself. Tommy showed him his new\r\nsoldiers, and he seemed quite interested; and then he had a ride on the\r\nrocking horse, and was sorry when it broke down under him; and after\r\nthat he came suddenly upon a beautiful doll which belonged to the\r\nyoungest sister.\r\n\r\n'Do let me nurse it,' he said, and the little girl gave it up timidly.\r\nOf course he nursed it the wrong way up, and at last he forgot, and sat\r\ndown on it, the head, which was wax, being crushed to pieces!\r\n\r\nTommy was in fits of laughter at the droll face he made as he held out\r\nthe crushed doll at arm's length, and looked at it with one eye shut,\r\nexclaiming, 'Poor thing! what a pity! I do 'ope I 'aven't made its 'ead\r\nache!'\r\n\r\nBut the two little girls were crying bitterly in one another's arms, and\r\nBarbara turned on the clown with tremendous indignation.\r\n\r\n'You did it on purpose, you know you did!' she said.\r\n\r\n'Go away, little girl; don't talk to me!' said the clown, putting Tommy\r\nin front of him.\r\n\r\n'Tommy,' she said, 'what did you bring your friend up here for? He only\r\nspoils everything he's allowed to touch. Take him away!'\r\n\r\n'Barbara,' pleaded Tommy, 'he's a _visitor_, you know!'\r\n\r\n'I don't care,' she replied. 'Mr. Clown, you shan't stay here; this is\r\nour room, and we don't want you. Go away!' She walked towards him\r\nlooking so fierce that he backed hastily. 'Go downstairs,' she said,\r\npointing to the door. 'You, too, Tommy, for you encouraged him!'\r\n\r\n'Nyah, nyah, nyah!' said the clown, a sound by which he intended to\r\nimitate her anger. 'Oh, please, I'm going; remember me to your mother.'\r\nAnd he left the room, followed rather sadly by Tommy, who felt that\r\nBarbara was angry with him. 'That's a very disagribble little girl,'\r\nremarked the clown, confidentially, when they were safe outside, and\r\nTommy thought it wiser to agree.\r\n\r\n'What have you got in your pockets?' he asked, presently, seeing a hard\r\nbulge in his friend's white trunks.\r\n\r\n'Only some o' your nice soldiers,' said the clown, and walked into the\r\nschoolroom, where there was a fire burning. 'Are they brave?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Very,' said Tommy, who had quite persuaded himself that this was so.\r\n'Look here, we'll have a battle.' He thought a battle would keep the\r\nclown quiet. 'Here's two cannon and peas, and you shall be the French\r\nand I'll be English.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' said the clown, and took his share of the soldiers and\r\ncalmly put them all in the middle of the red-hot coals. 'I want to be\r\nquite sure they can stand fire first,' he explained; and then, as they\r\nmelted, he said, 'There, you see, they're all running away. I never see\r\nsuch cowards.'\r\n\r\nTommy was in a great rage, and could almost have cried, if it had not\r\nbeen babyish, for they were his best regiments which he could see\r\ndropping down in great glittering stars on the ashes below. 'That's a\r\ncaddish thing to do,' he said, with difficulty; 'I didn't give them to\r\nyou to put in the fire!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I thought you did,' said the clown, 'I beg your pardon;' and he\r\nthrew the rest after them as he spoke.\r\n\r\n'You're a beast!' cried Tommy, indignantly; 'I've done with you, after\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, yer ain't,' he returned.\r\n\r\n'I have, though,' said Tommy; 'we're not friends any longer.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' said the clown; 'when I'm not friends with any one, I take\r\nand use the red-'ot poker to 'em,' and he put it in the fire to heat as\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\nThis terrified the boy. It was no use trying to argue with the clown,\r\nand he had seen how he used a red-hot poker. 'Well, I'll forgive you\r\nthis time,' he said hastily; 'let's come away from here.'\r\n\r\n'I tell you what,' said the clown, 'you and me'll go down in the kitchen\r\nand make a pie.'\r\n\r\nTommy forgot his injuries at this delightful idea; he knew what the\r\nclown's notion of pie-making would be. 'Yes,' he said eagerly, 'that\r\nwill be jolly; only I don't know,' he added doubtfully, 'if cook will\r\nlet us.'\r\n\r\nHowever, the clown soon managed to secure the kitchen to himself; he had\r\nmerely to attempt to kiss the cook once or twice and throw the best\r\ndinner service at the other servants, and they were left quite alone to\r\ndo as they pleased.\r\n\r\nWhat fun it was, to begin with! The clown brought out a large deep dish,\r\nand began by putting a whole turkey and an unskinned hare in it out of\r\nthe larder; after that he put in sausages, jam, pickled walnuts, and\r\nlemons, and, in short, the first thing that came to hand.\r\n\r\n'It ain't 'arf full yet,' he said at last, as he looked gravely into the\r\npie.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Tommy, sympathetically, 'can't we get anything else to put\r\nin?'\r\n\r\n'The very thing,' cried the clown, 'you're just about the right size to\r\nfill up--my! what a pie it's going to be, eh?' And he caught up his\r\nyoung friend, just as he was, rammed him into the pie, and poured sauce\r\non him.\r\n\r\nBut he kicked and howled until the clown grew seriously displeased. 'Why\r\ncarn't you lay quiet,' he said angrily, 'like the turkey does? you don't\r\ndeserve to be put into such a nice pie!'\r\n\r\n'If you make a pie of me,' said Tommy, artfully, 'there'll be nobody to\r\nlook on and laugh at you, you know!'\r\n\r\n'No more there won't,' said the clown, and allowed him to crawl out,\r\nall over sauce. 'It was a pity,' he declared, 'because he fitted so\r\nnicely, and now they would have to look about for something else;' but\r\nhe contrived to make a shift with the contents of the cook's\r\nwork-basket, which he poured in--reels, pin-cushions, wax, and all. He\r\nhad tried to put the kitchen cat in too, but she scratched his hands and\r\ncould not be induced to form the finishing touch to the pie.\r\n\r\nHow the clown got the paste and rolled it, and made Tommy in a mess with\r\nit, and how the pie was finished at last, would take too long to tell\r\nhere; but somehow it was not quite such capital fun as he had\r\nexpected--it seemed to want the pantomime music or something; and then\r\nTommy was always dreading lest the clown should change his mind at the\r\nlast minute, and put him in the pie after all.\r\n\r\nEven when it was safely in the oven he had another fear lest he should\r\nbe made to stay and eat it, for it had such very peculiar things in it\r\nthat it could not be at all nice. Fortunately, as soon as it was put\r\naway the clown seemed to weary of it himself.\r\n\r\n'Let me and you go and take a walk,' he suggested.\r\n\r\nTommy caught at the proposal, for he was fast becoming afraid of the\r\nclown, and felt really glad to get him out of the house; so he got his\r\ncap, and the clown put on a brown overcoat and a tall hat, under which\r\nhis white and red face looked stranger than ever, and they sallied forth\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOnce Tommy would have thought it a high privilege to be allowed to go\r\nout shopping with a clown; but, if the plain truth must be told, he did\r\nnot enjoy himself so very much after all. People seemed to stare at them\r\nso, for one thing, and he felt almost ashamed of his companion, whose\r\nbehaviour was outrageously ridiculous. They went to all the family\r\ntradesmen, to whom Tommy was, of course, well known, and the clown\r\n_would_ order the most impossible things, and say they were for Tommy!\r\nOnce he even pushed him into a large draper's shop, full of pretty and\r\ncontemptuous young ladies, and basely left him to explain his presence\r\nas he could.\r\n\r\nBut it was worse when they happened to meet an Italian boy with a tray\r\nof plaster images on his head.\r\n\r\n'Here's a lark!' said the clown, and elbowed Tommy against him in such a\r\nway that the tray slipped and all the images fell to the ground with a\r\ncrash.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly amusing to see all the pieces rolling about; but, while\r\nTommy was still laughing, the boy began to howl and denounce him to the\r\ncrowd which gathered round them. The crowd declared that it was a shame,\r\nand that Tommy ought to be made to pay for it; and no one said so more\r\nloudly and indignantly than the clown!\r\n\r\nBefore he could escape he had to give his father's name and address, and\r\npromise that he would pay for the damage, after which he joined the\r\nclown (who had strolled on) with a heavy heart, for he knew that that\r\nbusiness would stop all his pocket-money for years after he was grown\r\nup! He even ventured to reproach his friend: 'I shan't sneak of you, of\r\ncourse, he said, 'but you know _you_ did it!' The clown's only answer to\r\nthis was a reproof for telling wicked stories.\r\n\r\nAt last they passed a confectioner's, and the clown suddenly remembered\r\nthat he was hungry, so they went in, and he borrowed sixpence from\r\nTommy, which he spent in buns.\r\n\r\nHe ate them all himself slowly, and was so very quiet and well-behaved\r\nall the time that Tommy hoped he was sobering down. They had gone a\r\nlittle way from the shop when he found that the clown was eating tarts.\r\n\r\n'You might give me one,' said Tommy; and the clown, after looking over\r\nhis shoulder, actually gave him all he had left, filling his pocket with\r\nthem, in fact.\r\n\r\n'I never saw you buy them,' he said wonderingly, which the clown said\r\nwas very peculiar; and just then an attendant came up breathlessly.\r\n\r\n'You forgot to pay for those tarts,' she said.\r\n\r\nThe clown replied that he never took pastry. She insisted that they\r\nwere gone, and he must have taken them.\r\n\r\n'It wasn't me, please,' said the clown; 'it was this little boy done it.\r\nWhy, he's got a jam tart in his pocket now. Where's a policeman?'\r\n\r\nTommy was so thunderstruck by this treachery that he could say nothing.\r\nIt was only what he might have expected, for had not the clown served\r\nthe pantaloon exactly the same the night before? But that did not make\r\nthe situation any the funnier now, particularly as the clown made such a\r\nnoise that two real policemen came hurrying up.\r\n\r\nTommy did not wait for them. No one held him, and he ran away at the top\r\nof his speed. What a nightmare sort of run it was!--the policemen\r\nchasing him, and the clown urging them on at the top of his voice.\r\nEverybody he passed turned round and ran after him too.\r\n\r\nStill he kept ahead. He was surprised to find how fast he could run, and\r\nall at once he remembered that he was running the opposite way from\r\nhome. Quick as thought he turned up the first street he came to, hoping\r\nto throw them off the scent and get home by a back way.\r\n\r\nFor the moment he thought he had got rid of them; but just as he stopped\r\nto take breath, they all came whooping and hallooing round the corner\r\nafter him; and he had to scamper on, panting, and sobbing, and\r\nstaggering, and almost out of his mind with fright. If he could only\r\nget home first, and tell his mother! But they were gaining on him, and\r\nthe clown was leading and roaring with delight as he drew closer and\r\ncloser. He came to a point where two roads met. It was round another\r\ncorner, and they could not see him. He ran down one, and, to his immense\r\nrelief, found they had taken the other. He was saved, for his house was\r\nquite near now.\r\n\r\nHe tried to hasten, but the pavement was all slushy and slippery, and\r\nhis boots felt heavier and heavier, and, to add to his misery, the\r\npursuers had found out their mistake. As he looked back, he could see\r\nthe clown galloping round the corner and hear his yell of discovery.\r\n\r\n'Oh, fairy, dear fairy,' he gasped, 'save me this time. I _do_ like your\r\npart best, now!'\r\n\r\nShe must have heard him and taken pity, for in a second he had reached\r\nhis door, and it flew open before him. He was not safe even yet, so he\r\nrushed upstairs to his bedroom, and bounced, just as he was, into his\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n'If they come up I'll pretend I'm ill,' he thought, as he covered his\r\nhead with the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nThey _were_ coming up, all of them. There was a great trampling on the\r\nstairs. He heard the clown officiously shouting: 'This way, Mr.\r\nPoliceman, sir!' and then a tremendous battering at his door.\r\n\r\nHe lay there shivering under the blankets.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps they'll think the door's locked, and go away,' he tried to\r\nhope, and the battering went on not quite so violently.\r\n\r\n'Master Tommy! Master Tommy!' It was Sarah's voice. They had got her to\r\ncome up and tempt him out. Well, she _wouldn't_, then!\r\n\r\nAnd then--oh! horror!--the door was thrown open. He sprang out of bed in\r\nan agony.\r\n\r\n'Sarah! Sarah! keep them out,' he gasped. 'Don't let them take me away!'\r\n\r\n'Lor', Master Tommy! keep who out?' said Sarah, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n'The--the clown--and the policemen,' he said. 'I know they're behind the\r\ndoor.'\r\n\r\n'There, there!' said Sarah; 'why, you ain't done dreaming yet. That's\r\nwhat comes of going out to these late pantomimes. Rub your eyes; it's\r\nnearly eight o'clock.'\r\n\r\nTommy could have hugged her. It was only a dream after all, then. As he\r\nstood there, shivering in his nightgown, the nightmare clown began to\r\nmelt away, though even yet some of the adventures he had gone through\r\nseemed too vivid to be quite imaginary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, his Uncle John actually did call that morning, and to\r\ntake him to the Crystal Palace, too; and as there was no butter-slide\r\nfor him to fall down on, they were able to go. On the way Tommy told him\r\nall about his unpleasant dream.\r\n\r\n'I shall always hate a clown after this, uncle,' he said, as he\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n'My good Tommy,' said his uncle, 'when you are fortunate enough to dream\r\na dream with a moral in it, don't go and apply it the wrong way up. The\r\nreal clown, like a sensible man, keeps his fun for the place where it is\r\nharmless and appreciated, and away from the pantomime conducts himself\r\nlike any other respectable person. Now, your _dream_ clown, Tommy----'\r\n\r\n'I know,' said Tommy, meekly. 'Should you think the pantomime was good\r\nhere, Uncle John?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A CANINE ISHMAEL_\r\n\r\n(FROM THE NOTES OF A DINER-OUT)\r\n\r\n\r\n'Tell me,' she said suddenly, with a pretty imperiousness that seemed to\r\nbelong to her, 'are you fond of dogs?' How we arrived at the subject I\r\nforget now, but I know she had just been describing how a collie at a\r\ndog-show she had visited lately had suddenly thrown his forepaws round\r\nher neck in a burst of affection--a proceeding which, in my own mind\r\n(although I prudently kept this to myself), I considered less\r\nastonishing than she appeared to do.\r\n\r\nFor I had had the privilege of taking her in to dinner, and the meal had\r\nnot reached a very advanced stage before I had come to the conclusion\r\nthat she was the most charming, if not the loveliest, person I had ever\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for me that I was honestly able to answer her question\r\nin a satisfactory manner, for, had it been otherwise, I doubt whether\r\nshe would have deigned to bestow much more of her conversation upon me.\r\n\r\n'Then I wonder,' she said next, meditatively, 'if you would care to\r\nhear about a dog that belonged to--to someone I know very well? Or would\r\nit bore you?'\r\n\r\nI am very certain that if she had volunteered to relate the adventures\r\nof Telemachus, or the history of the Thirty Years' War, I should have\r\naccepted the proposal with a quite genuine gratitude. As it was, I made\r\nit sufficiently plain that I should care very much indeed to hear about\r\nthat dog.\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment to reject an unfortunate _entrée_ (which I\r\nconfess to doing my best to console), and then she began her story. I\r\nshall try to set it down as nearly as possible in her own words,\r\nalthough I cannot hope to convey the peculiar charm and interest that\r\nshe gave it for me. It was not, I need hardly say, told all at once, but\r\nwas subject to the inevitable interruptions which render a dinner-table\r\nintimacy so piquantly precarious.\r\n\r\n'This dog,' she began quietly, without any air of beginning a story,\r\n'this dog was called Pepper. He was not much to look at--rather a rough,\r\nmongrelly kind of animal; and he and a young man had kept house together\r\nfor a long time, for the young man was a bachelor and lived in chambers\r\nby himself. He always used to say that he didn't like to get engaged to\r\nanyone, because he was sure it would put Pepper out so fearfully.\r\nHowever, he met somebody at last who made him forget about Pepper, and\r\nhe proposed and was accepted--and then, you know,' she added, as a\r\nlittle dimple came in her cheek, 'he had to go home and break the news\r\nto the dog.'\r\n\r\nShe had just got to this point, when, taking advantage of a pause she\r\nmade, the man on her other side (who was, I daresay, strictly within his\r\nrights, although I remember at the time considering him a pushing beast)\r\nstruck in with some remark which she turned to answer, leaving me\r\nleisure to reflect.\r\n\r\nI was feeling vaguely uncomfortable about this story; something, it\r\nwould be hard to say what, in her way of mentioning Pepper's owner made\r\nme suspect that he was more than a mere acquaintance of hers.\r\n\r\nWas it _she_, then, who was responsible for----? It was no business of\r\nmine, of course; I had never met her in my life till that evening--but I\r\nbegan to be impatient to hear the rest.\r\n\r\nAnd at last she turned to me again: 'I hope you haven't forgotten that I\r\nwas in the middle of a story. You haven't? And you would really like me\r\nto go on? Well, then--oh yes, when Pepper was told, he was naturally a\r\nlittle annoyed at first. I daresay he considered he ought to have been\r\nconsulted previously. But, as soon as he had seen the lady, he withdrew\r\nall opposition--which his master declared was a tremendous load off his\r\nmind, for Pepper was rather a difficult dog, and slow as a rule to take\r\nstrangers into his affections, a little snappy and surly, and very\r\neasily hurt or offended. Don't you know dogs who are sensitive like\r\nthat? _I_ do, and I'm always so sorry for them--they feel little things\r\nso much, and one never can find out what's the matter, and have it out\r\nwith them! Sometimes it's shyness; once I had a dog who was quite\r\npainfully shy--self-consciousness it was really, I suppose, for he\r\nalways fancied everybody was looking at him, and often when people were\r\ncalling he would come and hide his face in the folds of my dress till\r\nthey had gone--it was too ridiculous! But about Pepper. He was devoted\r\nto his new mistress from the very first. I am not sure that she was\r\nquite so struck with him, for he was not at all a lady's dog, and his\r\nmanners had been very much neglected. Still, she came quite to like him\r\nin time; and when they were married, Pepper went with them for the\r\nhoneymoon.'\r\n\r\n'_When they were married!_' I glanced at the card which lay half-hidden\r\nby her plate. Surely _Miss_ So-and-so was written on it?--yes, it was\r\ncertainly 'Miss.' It was odd that such a circumstance should have\r\nincreased my enjoyment of the story, perhaps--but it undoubtedly did.\r\n\r\n'After the honeymoon,' my neighbour continued, 'they came to live in the\r\nnew house, which was quite a tiny one, and Pepper was a very important\r\npersonage in it indeed. He had his mistress all to himself for the\r\ngreater part of most days, as his master had to be away in town; so she\r\nused to talk to him intimately, and tell him more than she would have\r\nthought of confiding to most people. Sometimes, when she thought there\r\nwas no fear of callers coming, she would make him play, and this was\r\nquite a new sensation for Pepper, who was a serious-minded animal, and\r\ntook very solemn views of life. At first he hadn't the faintest idea\r\nwhat was expected of him; it must have been rather like trying to romp\r\nwith a parish beadle, he was so intensely respectable! But as soon as he\r\nonce grasped the notion and understood that no liberty was intended, he\r\nlent himself to it readily enough and learnt to gambol quite creditably.\r\nThen he was made much of in all sorts of ways; she washed him twice a\r\nweek with her very own hands--which his master would never have dreamt\r\nof doing--and she was always trying new ribbons on his complexion. That\r\nrather bored him at first, but it ended by making him a little conceited\r\nabout his appearance. Altogether he was dearly fond of her, and I don't\r\nbelieve he had ever been happier in all his life than he was in those\r\ndays. Only, unfortunately, it was all too good to last.'\r\n\r\nHere I had to pass olives or something to somebody, and the other man,\r\nseeing his chance, and, to do him justice, with no idea that he was\r\ninterrupting a story, struck in once more, so that the history of Pepper\r\nhad to remain in abeyance for several minutes.\r\n\r\nMy uneasiness returned. Could there be a mistake about that name-card\r\nafter all? Cards _do_ get re-arranged sometimes, and she seemed to know\r\nthat young couple so very intimately. I tried to remember whether I had\r\nbeen introduced to her as a Miss or Mrs. So-and-so, but without success.\r\nThere is some fatality which generally distracts one's attention at the\r\ncritical moment of introduction, and in this case it was perhaps easily\r\naccounted for. My turn came again, and she took up her tale once more.\r\n'I think when I left off I was saying that Pepper's happiness was too\r\ngood to last. And so it was. For his mistress was ill, and, though he\r\nsnuffed and scratched and whined at the door of her room for ever so\r\nlong, they wouldn't let him in. But he managed to slip in one day\r\nsomehow, and jumped up on her lap and licked her hands and face, and\r\nalmost went out of his mind with joy at seeing her again. Only (I told\r\nyou he was a sensitive dog) it gradually struck him that she was not\r\n_quite_ so pleased to see him as usual--and presently he found out the\r\nreason. There was another animal there, a new pet, which seemed to take\r\nup a good deal of her attention. Of course you guess what that was--but\r\nPepper had never seen a baby before, and he took it as a personal slight\r\nand was dreadfully offended. He simply walked straight out of the room\r\nand downstairs to the kitchen, where he stayed for days.\r\n\r\n'I don't think he enjoyed his sulk much, poor doggie; perhaps he had an\r\nidea that when they saw how much he took it to heart they would send the\r\nbaby away. But as time went on and this didn't seem to occur to them,\r\nhe decided to come out of the sulks and look over the matter, and he\r\ncame back quite prepared to resume the old footing. Only everything was\r\ndifferent. No one seemed to notice that he was in the room now, and his\r\nmistress never invited him to have a game; she even forgot to have him\r\nwashed--and one of his peculiarities was that he had no objection to\r\nsoap and warm water. The worst of it was, too, that before very long the\r\nbaby followed him into the sitting-room, and, do what he could, he\r\ncouldn't make the stupid little thing understand that it had no business\r\nthere. If you think of it, a baby must strike a dog as a very inferior\r\nlittle animal: it can't bark (well, yes, it _can_ howl), but it's no\r\ngood whatever with rats, and yet everybody makes a tremendous fuss about\r\nit! The baby got all poor Pepper's bows now; and his mistress played\r\ngames with it, though Pepper felt he could have done it ever so much\r\nbetter, but he was never allowed to join in. So he used to lie on a rug\r\nand pretend he didn't mind, though, really, I'm certain he felt it\r\nhorribly. I always believe, you know, that people never give dogs half\r\ncredit enough for feeling things, don't you?\r\n\r\n'Well, at last came the worst indignity of all: Pepper was driven from\r\nhis rug--his own particular rug--to make room for the baby; and when he\r\nhad got away into a corner to cry quietly, all by himself, that wretched\r\nbaby came and crawled after him and pulled his tail!\r\n\r\n'He always _had_ been particular about his tail, and never allowed\r\nanybody to touch it but very intimate friends, and even then under\r\nprotest, so you can imagine how insulted he felt.\r\n\r\n'It was too much for him, and he lost the last scrap of temper he had.\r\nThey said he bit the baby, and I'm afraid he did--though not enough\r\nreally to hurt it; still, it howled fearfully, of course, and from that\r\nmoment it was all over with poor Pepper--he was a ruined dog!\r\n\r\n'When his master came home that evening he was told the whole story.\r\nPepper's mistress said she would be ever so sorry to part with him, but,\r\nafter his misbehaviour, she should never know a moment's peace until he\r\nwas out of the house--it really wasn't safe for baby!\r\n\r\n'And his master was sorry, naturally; but I suppose he was beginning\r\nrather to like the baby himself, and so the end of it was that Pepper\r\nhad to go. They did all they could for him; found him a comfortable\r\nhome, with a friend who was looking out for a good house-dog, and wasn't\r\nparticular about breed, and, after that, they heard nothing of him for a\r\nlong while. And, when they did hear, it was rather a bad report: the\r\nfriend could do nothing with Pepper at all; he had to tie him up in the\r\nstable, and then he snapped at everyone who came near, and howled all\r\nnight--they were really almost afraid of him.\r\n\r\n'So when Pepper's mistress heard that, she felt more thankful than ever\r\nthat the dog had been sent away, and tried to think no more about him.\r\nShe had quite forgotten all about it, when, one day, a new nursemaid,\r\nwho had taken the baby out for an airing, came back with a terrible\r\naccount of a savage dog which had attacked them, and leaped up at the\r\nperambulator so persistently that it was as much as she could do to\r\ndrive it away. And even then Pepper's mistress did not associate the dog\r\nwith him; she thought he had been destroyed long ago.\r\n\r\n'But the next time the nurse went out with the baby she took a thick\r\nstick with her, in case the dog should come again. And no sooner had she\r\nlifted the perambulator over the step, than the dog _did_ come again,\r\nexactly as if he had been lying in wait for them ever since outside the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n'The nurse was a strong country girl, with plenty of pluck, and as the\r\ndog came leaping and barking about in a very alarming way, she hit him\r\nas hard as she could on his head. The wonder is she did not kill him on\r\nthe spot, and, as it was, the blow turned him perfectly giddy and silly\r\nfor a time, and he ran round and round in a dazed sort of way--do you\r\nthink you could lower that candle-shade just a little? Thanks!' she\r\nbroke off suddenly, as I obeyed. 'Well, she was going to strike again,\r\nwhen her mistress rushed out, just in time to stop her. For, you see,\r\nshe had been watching at the window, and although the poor beast was\r\nmiserably thin, and rough, and neglected-looking, she knew at once that\r\nit must be Pepper, and that he was not in the least mad or dangerous,\r\nbut only trying his best to make his peace with the baby. Very likely\r\nhis dignity or his conscience or something wouldn't let him come back\r\nquite at once, you know; and perhaps he thought he had better get the\r\nbaby on his side first. And then all at once, his mistress--I heard all\r\nthis through her, of course--his mistress suddenly remembered how\r\ndevoted Pepper had been to her, and how fond she had once been of him,\r\nand when she saw him standing, stupid and shivering, there, her heart\r\nsoftened to him, and she went to make it up with him, and tell him that\r\nhe was forgiven and should come back and be her dog again, just as in\r\nthe old days!----'\r\n\r\nHere she broke off for a moment. I did not venture to look at her, but I\r\nthought her voice trembled a little when she spoke again. 'I don't quite\r\nknow _why_ I tell you all this. There was a time when I never could bear\r\nthe end of it myself,' she said; 'but I have begun, and I will finish\r\nnow. Well, Pepper's mistress went towards him, and called him;\r\nbut--whether he was still too dizzy to quite understand who she was, or\r\nwhether his pride came uppermost again, poor dear! I don't know--but he\r\ngave her just one look (she says she will never forget it--never; it\r\nwent straight to her heart), and then he walked very slowly and\r\ndeliberately away.\r\n\r\n'She couldn't bear it; she followed; she felt she simply _must_ make\r\nhim understand how very, very sorry she was for him; but the moment he\r\nheard her he began to run faster and faster, until he was out of reach\r\nand out of sight, and she had to come back. I know she was crying\r\nbitterly by that time.'\r\n\r\n'And he never came back again?' I asked, after a silence.\r\n\r\n'Never again!' she said softly; 'that was the very last they ever saw or\r\nheard of him. And--and I've always loved every dog since for Pepper's\r\nsake!'\r\n\r\n'I'm almost glad he did decline to come back,' I declared; 'it served\r\nhis mistress right--she didn't deserve anything else!'\r\n\r\n'Ah, I didn't want you to say that!' she protested; 'she never meant to\r\nbe so unkind--it was all for the baby's sake!'\r\n\r\nI was distinctly astonished, for all her sympathy in telling the story\r\nhad seemed to lie in the other direction.\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to say,' I cried involuntarily, 'that you can find any\r\nexcuses for her? I did not expect _you_ would take the baby's part!'\r\n\r\n'But I did,' she confessed, with lowered eyes--'I _did_ take the baby's\r\npart--it was all my doing that Pepper was sent away--I have been sorry\r\nenough for it since!'\r\n\r\nIt was her own story she had been telling at second-hand after all--and\r\nshe was not Miss So-and-so! I had entirely forgotten the existence of\r\nany other members of the party but our two selves, but at the moment of\r\nthis discovery--which was doubly painful--I was recalled by a general\r\nrustle to the fact that we were at a dinner-party, and that our hostess\r\nhad just given the signal.\r\n\r\nAs I rose and drew back my chair to allow my neighbour to pass, she\r\nraised her eyes for a moment and said almost meekly:\r\n\r\n'I _was_ the baby, you see!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MARJORY_\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thought myself justified in printing the following narrative,\r\nfound among the papers of my dead friend, Douglas Cameron, who left me\r\ndiscretion to deal with them as I saw fit. It was written indeed, as its\r\nopening words imply, rather for his own solace and relief than with the\r\nexpectation that it would be read by any other. But, painful and\r\nintimate as it is in parts, I cannot think that any harm will be done by\r\nprinting it now, with some necessary alterations in the names of the\r\ncharacters chiefly concerned.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, leaving the story to speak for itself, I should like to\r\nstate, in justice to my friend, that during the whole of my acquaintance\r\nwith him, which began in our college days, I never saw anything to\r\nindicate the morbid timidity and weakness of character that seem to have\r\nmarked him as a boy. Reserved he undoubtedly was, with a taste for\r\nsolitude that made him shrink from the society of all but a small\r\ncircle, and with a sensitive and shy nature which prevented him from\r\ndoing himself complete justice; but he was very capable of holding his\r\nown on occasion, and in his disposition, as I knew it, there was no want\r\nof moral courage, nor any trace of effeminacy.\r\n\r\nHow far he may have unconsciously exaggerated such failings in the\r\nrevelation of his earlier self, or what the influence of such an\r\nexperience as he relates may have done to strengthen the moral fibre,\r\nare points on which I can express no opinion, any more than I can pledge\r\nmyself to the credibility of the supernatural element of his story.\r\n\r\nIt may be that only in the boy's overwrought imagination, the innocent\r\nChild-spirit came back to complete the work of love and pity she had\r\nbegun in life; but I know that he himself believed otherwise, and,\r\ntruly, if those who leave us are permitted to return at all, it must be\r\non some such errand as Marjory's.\r\n\r\nDouglas Cameron's life was short, and in it, so far as I am aware, he\r\nmet no one who at all replaced his lost ideal. Of this I cannot be\r\nabsolutely certain, for he was a reticent man in such matters; but I\r\nthink, had it been so, I should have known of it, for we were very close\r\nfriends. One would hardly expect, perhaps, that an ordinary man would\r\nremain faithful all his days to the far-off memory of a child-love; but\r\nthen Cameron was not quite as other men, nor were his days long in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnd if this ideal of his was never dimmed for him by some grosser, and\r\nless spiritual, passion, who shall say that he may not have been a\r\nbetter and even a happier man in consequence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not without an effort that I have resolved to break, in the course\r\nof this narrative, the reserve maintained for nearly twenty years. But\r\nthe chief reason for silence is removed now that all those are gone who\r\nmight have been pained or harmed by what I have to tell, and, though I\r\nshrink still from reviving certain memories that are fraught with pain,\r\nthere are others associated therewith which will surely bring\r\nconsolation and relief.\r\n\r\nI must have been about eleven at the time I am speaking of, and the\r\nchange which--for good or ill--comes over most boys' lives had not yet\r\nthreatened mine. I had not left home for school, nor did it seem at all\r\nprobable then that I should ever do so.\r\n\r\nWhen I read (I was a great reader) of Dotheboys Hall and Salem House--a\r\ncombination of which establishments formed my notion of school-life--it\r\nwas with no more personal interest than a cripple might feel in perusing\r\nthe notice of an impending conscription; for from the battles of\r\nschool-life I was fortunately exempted.\r\n\r\nI was the only son of a widow, and we led a secluded life in a London\r\nsuburb. My mother took charge of my education herself, and, as far as\r\nmere acquirements went, I was certainly not behind other boys of my\r\nage. I owe too much to that loving and careful training, Heaven knows,\r\nto think of casting any reflection upon it here, but my surroundings\r\nwere such as almost necessarily to exclude all bracing and hardening\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nMy mother had few friends; we were content with our own companionship,\r\nand of boys I knew and cared to know nothing; in fact, I regarded a\r\nstrange boy with much the same unreasoning aversion as many excellent\r\nwomen feel for the most ordinary cow.\r\n\r\nI was happy to think that I should never be called upon to associate\r\nwith them; by-and-by, when I outgrew my mother's teaching, I was to have\r\na tutor, perhaps even go to college in time, and when I became a man I\r\nwas to be a curate and live with my mother in a clematis-covered cottage\r\nin some pleasant village.\r\n\r\nShe would often dwell on this future with a tender prospective pride;\r\nshe spoke of it on the very day that saw it shattered for ever.\r\n\r\nFor there came a morning when, on going to her with my lessons for the\r\nday, I was gladdened with an unexpected holiday. I little knew\r\nthen--though I was to learn it soon enough--that my lessons had been all\r\nholidays, or that on that day they were to end for ever.\r\n\r\nMy mother had had one or two previous attacks of an illness which seemed\r\nto prostrate her for a short period, and as she soon regained her\r\nordinary health, I did not think they could be of a serious nature.\r\n\r\nSo I devoted my holiday cheerfully enough to the illumination of a\r\ntext, on the gaudy colouring of which I found myself gazing two days\r\nlater with a dull wonder, as at the work of a strange hand in a long\r\ndead past, for the boy who had painted that was a happy boy who had a\r\nmother, and for two endless days I had been alone.\r\n\r\nThose days, and many that followed, come back to me now but vaguely. I\r\npassed them mostly in a state of blank bewilderment caused by the double\r\nsense of sameness and strangeness in everything around me; then there\r\nwere times when this gave way to a passionate anguish which refused all\r\nattempts at comfort, and times even--but very, very seldom--when I\r\nalmost forgot what had happened to me.\r\n\r\nOur one servant remained in the house with me, and a friend and\r\nneighbour of my mother's was constant in her endeavours to relieve my\r\nloneliness; but I was impatient of them, I fear, and chiefly anxious to\r\nbe left alone to indulge my melancholy unchecked.\r\n\r\nI remember how, as autumn began, and leaf after leaf fluttered down from\r\nthe trees in our little garden, I watched them fall with a heavier\r\nheart, for they had known my mother, and now they, too, were deserting\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThis morbid state of mind had lasted quite long enough when my uncle,\r\nwho was my guardian, saw fit to put a summary end to it by sending me\r\nto school forthwith; he would have softened the change for me by taking\r\nme to his own home first, but there was illness of some sort there, and\r\nthis was out of the question.\r\n\r\nI was neither sorry nor glad when I heard of it, for all places were the\r\nsame to me just then; only, as the time drew near, I began to regard the\r\nfuture with a growing dread.\r\n\r\nThe school was at some distance from London, and my uncle took me down\r\nby rail; but the only fact I remember connected with the journey is that\r\nthere was a boy in the carriage with us who cracked walnuts all the way,\r\nand I wondered if he was going to school too, and concluded that he was\r\nnot, or he would hardly eat quite so many walnuts.\r\n\r\nLater we were passing through some wrought-iron gates, and down an\r\navenue of young chestnuts, which made a gorgeous autumn canopy of\r\nscarlet, amber, and orange, up to a fine old red-brick house, with a\r\nhigh-pitched roof, and a cupola in which a big bell hung, tinted a warm\r\ngold by the afternoon sun.\r\n\r\nThis was my school, and it did not look so very-terrible after all.\r\nThere was a big bow-window by the pillared portico, and, looking timidly\r\nin, I saw a girl of about my own age sitting there, absorbed in the book\r\nshe was reading, her long brown hair drooping over her cheek and the\r\nhand on which it rested.\r\n\r\nShe glanced up at the sound of the door-bell, and I felt her eyes\r\nexamining me seriously and critically, and then I forgot everything but\r\nthe fact that I was about to be introduced to my future schoolmaster,\r\nthe Rev. Basil Dering.\r\n\r\nThis was less of an ordeal than I had expected; he had a strong,\r\nmassively-cut, leonine face, free and abundant white hair, streaked with\r\ndark grey, but there was a kind light in his eyes as I looked up at\r\nthem, and the firm mouth could smile, I found, pleasantly enough.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dering seemed younger, and was handsome, with a certain stateliness\r\nand decision of manner which put me less at my ease, and I was relieved\r\nto be told I might say good-bye to my uncle, and wander about the\r\ngrounds as I liked.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised to pass through an empty schoolroom, and to descend\r\nby some steep stairs to a deserted playground, for we had been already\r\ntold that the Michaelmas holidays were not over, and that the boys would\r\nnot return for some days to come.\r\n\r\nIt gave me a kind of satisfaction to think of my resemblance, just then,\r\nto my favourite David Copperfield, but I was to have a far pleasanter\r\ncompanion than poor lugubrious, flute-tootling Mr. Mell, for as I paced\r\nthe damp paths paved with a mosaic of russet and yellow leaves, I heard\r\nlight footsteps behind me, and turned to find myself face to face with\r\nthe girl I had seen at the window.\r\n\r\nShe stood there breathless for an instant, for she had hurried to\r\novertake me, and against a background of crimson creepers I saw the\r\nbrilliant face, with its soft but fearless brown eyes, small straight\r\nnose, spirited mouth, and crisp wavy golden-brown hair, which I see now\r\nalmost as distinctly as I write.\r\n\r\n'You're the new boy,' she said at length. 'I've come out to make you\r\nfeel more at home. I suppose you don't feel _quite_ at home just yet?'\r\n\r\n'Not quite, thank you,' I said, lifting my cap with ceremony, for I had\r\nbeen taught to be particular about my manners; 'I have never been to\r\nschool before, you see, Miss Dering.'\r\n\r\nI think she was a little puzzled by so much politeness. 'I know,' she\r\nsaid softly; 'mother told me about it, and I'm very sorry. And I'm\r\ncalled Marjory, generally. Shall you like school, do you think?'\r\n\r\n'I might,' said I, 'if--if it wasn't for the boys!'\r\n\r\n'Boys aren't bad,' she said; 'ours are rather nice, I think. But perhaps\r\nyou don't know many?'\r\n\r\n'I know one,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'How old is _he_?' she wished to know.\r\n\r\n'Not very old--about three, I think,' I said. I had never wished till\r\nthen that my only male acquaintance had been of less tender years, but I\r\nfelt now that he was rather small, and saw that Marjory was of the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n'Why, he's only a baby!' she said; 'I thought you meant a _real_ boy.\r\nAnd is that all the boys you know? Are you fond of games?'\r\n\r\n'Some games--very,' said I.\r\n\r\n'What's your favourite game?' she demanded.\r\n\r\n'Bezique,' I answered, 'or draughts.'\r\n\r\n'I meant _out_door games; draughts are indoor games--_is_ indoor games,\r\nI mean--no, _are_ an indoor game--and _that_ doesn't sound grammar! But\r\nhaven't you ever played cricket? Not ever, really? I like it dreadfully\r\nmyself, only I'm not allowed to play with the boys, and I'm sure I can\r\nbat well enough for the second eleven--Cartwright said I could last\r\nterm--and I can bowl round-hand, and it's all no use, just because I was\r\nborn a girl! Wouldn't you like a game at something? They haven't taken\r\nin the croquet hoops yet; shall we play at that?'\r\n\r\nBut again I had to confess my ignorance of what was then the popular\r\ngarden game.\r\n\r\n'What do you generally do to amuse yourself, then?' she inquired.\r\n\r\n'I read, generally, or paint texts or outlines. Sometimes'--(I thought\r\nthis accomplishment would surely appeal to her)--'sometimes I do\r\nwoolwork!'\r\n\r\n'I don't think I would tell the boys that,' she advised rather gravely;\r\nshe evidently considered me a very desperate case. 'It's such a pity,\r\nyour not knowing any games. Suppose I taught you croquet, now? It would\r\nbe something to go on with, and you'll soon learn if you pay attention\r\nand do exactly what I tell you.'\r\n\r\nI submitted myself meekly to her direction, and Marjory enjoyed her\r\noffice of instructress for a time, until my extreme slowness wore out\r\nher patience, and she began to make little murmurs of disgust, for which\r\nshe invariably apologised. 'That's enough for to-day!' she said at last,\r\n'I'll take you again to-morrow. But you really must try and pick up\r\ngames, Cameron, or you'll never be liked. Let me see, I wonder if\r\nthere's time to teach you a little football. I think I could do that.'\r\n\r\nBefore she could make any further arrangements the tea-bell rang, but\r\nwhen I lay down that night in my strange cold bed, hemmed round by other\r\nbeds, which were only less formidable than if they had been occupied, I\r\ndid not feel so friendless as I might have done, and dreamed all night\r\nthat Marjory was teaching me something I understood to be cricket,\r\nwhich, however, was more like a bloated kind of backgammon.\r\n\r\nThe next day Marjory was allowed to go out walking with me, and I came\r\nhome feeling that I had known her for quite a long time, while her\r\nmanner to me had acquired a tone even more protecting than before, and\r\nshe began to betray an anxiety as to my school prospects which filled me\r\nwith uneasiness.\r\n\r\n'I am so afraid the boys won't like the way you talk,' she said on one\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n'I used to be told I spoke very correctly,' I said, verdantly enough.\r\n\r\n'But not like boys talk. You see, Cameron, I ought to know, with such a\r\nlot of them about. I tell you what I could do, though--I could teach you\r\nmost of their words--only I must run and ask mother first if I may.\r\nTeaching slang isn't the same as using it on my own account, is it?'\r\n\r\nMarjory darted off impulsively to ask leave, to return presently with a\r\nslow step and downcast face. 'I mayn't,' she announced. 'Mother says\r\n\"Certainly not,\" so there's an end of that! Still, I think myself it's a\r\ndecided pity.'\r\n\r\nAnd more than once that day she would observe, as if to herself, 'I do\r\nwish they had let him come to school in different collars!'\r\n\r\nI knew that these remarks, and others of a similar tendency, were\r\nprompted by her interest in my welfare, and I admired her too heartily\r\nalready to be offended by them: still, I cannot say they added to my\r\npeace of mind.\r\n\r\nAnd on the last evening of the holidays she said 'Good-night' to me with\r\nsome solemnity. 'Everything will be different after this,' she said; 'I\r\nshan't be able to see nearly so much of you, because I'm not allowed to\r\nbe much with the boys. But I shall be looking after you all the time,\r\nCameron, and seeing how you get on. And oh! I do hope you will try to be\r\na popular kind of boy!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I must own that this desire of Marjory's was not realised. I\r\ndo not know that I tried to be--and I certainly was not--a popular boy.\r\n\r\nThe other boys, I now know, were by no means bad specimens of the\r\nEnglish schoolboy, as will be evident when I state that, for a time, my\r\ndeep mourning was held by them to give me a claim to their forbearance.\r\n\r\nBut I had an unfortunate tendency to sudden floods of tears (apparently\r\nfor no cause whatever, really from some secret spring of association,\r\nsuch as I remember was touched when I first found myself learning Latin\r\nfrom the same primer over which my mother and I had puzzled together),\r\nand these outbursts at first aroused my companions' contempt, and\r\nfinally their open ridicule.\r\n\r\nI could not conceal my shrinking dislike to their society, which was not\r\ncalculated to make them more favourably disposed towards me; while my\r\ntastes, my expressions, my ways of looking at things, were all at total\r\nvariance with their own standards.\r\n\r\nThe general disapproval might well have shown itself in a harsher manner\r\nthan that of merely ignoring my existence--and it says much for the tone\r\nof the school that it did not; unfortunately, I felt their indifference\r\nalmost as keenly as I had dreaded their notice.\r\n\r\nFrom my masters I met with more favour, for I had been thoroughly well\r\ngrounded, and found, besides, a temporary distraction in my school-work;\r\nbut this was hardly likely to render me more beloved by my fellows, and\r\nso it came to pass that every day saw my isolation more complete.\r\n\r\nSomething, however, made me anxious to hide this from Marjory's eyes,\r\nand whenever she happened to be looking on at us in the school grounds\r\nor the playing fields, I made dismal attempts to appear on terms of\r\nequality with the rest, and would hang about a group with as much\r\npretence of belonging to it as I thought at all prudent.\r\n\r\nIf she had had more opportunities of questioning me, she would have\r\nfound me out long before; as it was, the only occasion on which we were\r\nnear one another was at the weekly drawing lesson, when, although she\r\ndrew less and talked more than the Professor quite approved of, she was\r\nobliged to restrict herself to a conversation which did not admit of\r\nconfidences.\r\n\r\nBut this negative neutral-tinted misery was not to last; I was harmless\r\nenough, but then to some natures nothing is so offensive as\r\ninoffensiveness. My isolation was certain to raise me up an enemy in\r\ntime, and he came in the person of one Clarence Ormsby.\r\n\r\nHe was a sturdy, good-looking fellow, about two years older than myself,\r\ngood at games, and, though not brilliant in other respects, rather idle\r\nthan dull. He was popular in the school, and I believe his general\r\ndisposition was by no means bad; but there must have been some hidden\r\nflaw in his nature which might never have disclosed itself for any other\r\nbut me.\r\n\r\nFor me he had displayed, almost from the first, one of those special\r\nantipathies that want but little excuse to ripen into hatred. My\r\npersonal appearance--I had the misfortune to be a decidedly plain\r\nboy--happened to be particularly displeasing to him, and, as he had an\r\nunsparing tongue, he used it to cover me with ridicule, until gradually,\r\nfinding that I did not retaliate, he indulged in acts of petty\r\noppression which, though not strictly bullying, were even more harassing\r\nand humiliating.\r\n\r\nI suspect now that if I had made ever so slight a stand at the outset, I\r\nshould have escaped further molestation, but I was not pugnacious by\r\nnature, and never made the experiment; partly, probably, from a theory\r\non which I had been reared, that all violence was vulgar, but chiefly\r\nfrom a tendency, unnatural in one of my age and sex, to find a\r\nsentimental satisfaction in a certain degree of unhappiness.\r\n\r\nSo that I can neither pity myself nor expect pity from others for woes\r\nwhich were so essentially my own creation, though they resulted, alas!\r\nin misery that was real enough.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that quick-sighted Marjory should discover the\r\nsubjection into which I had fallen, and her final enlightenment was\r\nbrought about in this manner. Ormsby and I were together alone, shortly\r\nbefore morning school, and he came towards me with an exercise of mine\r\nfrom which he had just been copying his own, for we were in the same\r\nclasses, despite the difference in our ages, and he was in the habit of\r\nprofiting thus by my industry.\r\n\r\n'Thanks, Cameron,' he said, with a sweetness which I distrusted, for he\r\nwas not as a rule so lavish in his gratitude. 'I've copied out that\r\nexercise of yours, but it's written so beastly badly that you'd better\r\ndo it over again.'\r\n\r\nWith which he deliberately tore the page he had been copying from to\r\nscraps, which he threw in my face, and strolled out down to the\r\nplayground.\r\n\r\nI was preparing submissively to do the exercise over again as well as I\r\ncould in the short time that was left, when I was startled by a low cry\r\nof indignation, and, looking round, saw Marjory standing in the doorway,\r\nand knew by her face that she had seen all.\r\n\r\n'Has Ormsby done that to you before?' she inquired.\r\n\r\n'Once or twice he has,' said I.\r\n\r\n'And you let him!' she cried. 'Oh, Cameron!'\r\n\r\n'What can I do?' I said.\r\n\r\n'I know what _I_ would do,' she replied. 'I would slap his face, or\r\npinch him. I wouldn't put up with it!'\r\n\r\n'Boys don't slap one another, or pinch,' I said, not displeased to find\r\na weak place in her knowledge of us.\r\n\r\n'Well, they do _something_!' she said; 'a real boy would. But I don't\r\nthink you are a real boy, Cameron. _I'll_ show you what to do. Where's\r\nthe exercise that--that _pig_ copied? Ah! I see it. And now--look!'\r\n(Here she tore his page as he had torn mine.)\r\n\r\n'Now for an envelope!' and from the Doctor's own desk she took an\r\nenvelope, in which she placed the fragments, and wrote on the outside in\r\nher round, childish hand: 'With Marjory's compliments, for being a\r\nbully.'\r\n\r\n'He won't do that again,' she said gleefully.\r\n\r\n'He'll do worse,' I said in dismay; 'I shall have to pay for it.\r\nMarjory, why didn't you leave things alone? I didn't complain--you know\r\nI didn't.'\r\n\r\nShe turned upon me, as well she might, in supreme disdain. 'Oh! what a\r\ncoward you are! I wouldn't believe all Cartwright told me about you when\r\nI asked--but I see it's all true. Why don't you stick up for yourself?'\r\n\r\nI muttered something or other.\r\n\r\n'But you _ought_ to. You'll never get on unless,' said Marjory, very\r\ndecidedly. 'Now, promise me you will, next time.'\r\n\r\nI sat there silent. I was disgusted with myself, and meanly angry with\r\nher for having rendered me so.\r\n\r\n'Then, listen,' she said impressively. 'I promised I would look after\r\nyou, and I did mean to, but it's no use if you won't help yourself. So,\r\nunless you say you won't go on being a coward any more, I shall have to\r\nleave you to your own way, and not take the least interest in you ever\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\n'Then, you may,' I said stolidly; 'I don't care.' I wondered, even while\r\nI spoke the words, what could be impelling me to treat spirited,\r\nwarm-hearted Marjory like that, and I hate myself still at the\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, then,' she said very quietly; 'I'm sorry, Cameron.' And she\r\nwent out without another word.\r\n\r\nWhen Ormsby came in, I watched him apprehensively as he read the\r\nenvelope upon his desk and saw its contents. He said nothing, however,\r\nthough he shot a malignant glance in my direction; but the lesson was\r\nnot lost upon him, for from that time he avoided all open ill-treatment\r\nof me, and even went so far as to assume a friendliness which might have\r\nreassured me had I not instinctively felt that it merely masked the old\r\ndislike.\r\n\r\nI was constantly the victim of mishaps, in the shape of missing and\r\ndefaced books, ink mysteriously spilt or strangely adulterated, and,\r\nthough I could never trace them to any definite hand, they seemed too\r\nsystematic to be quite accidental; still I made no sign, and hoped thus\r\nto disarm my persecutor--if persecutor there were.\r\n\r\nAs for my companions, I knew that in no case would they take the trouble\r\nto interfere in my behalf; they had held aloof from the first, the\r\ngeneral opinion (which I now perceive was not unjust) being that 'I\r\ndeserved all I got.'\r\n\r\nAnd my estrangement from Marjory grew wider and wider; she never spoke\r\nto me now when we sat near one another at the drawing-class; if she\r\nlooked at me it was by stealth, and with a glance that I thought\r\nsometimes was contemptuously pitiful, and sometimes half fancied\r\nbetrayed a willingness to return to the old comradeship.\r\n\r\nBut I nursed my stupid, sullen pride, though my heart ached with it at\r\ntimes. For I had now come to love Marjory devotedly, with a love that,\r\nthough I was a boy and she was a child, was as genuine as any I am ever\r\nlikely to feel again.\r\n\r\nThe chance of seeing her now and then, of hearing her speak--though it\r\nwas not to me--gave me the one interest in my life, which, but for her,\r\nI could hardly have borne. But this love of mine was a very far-off and\r\ndisinterested worship after all. I could not imagine myself ever\r\nspeaking of it to her, or picture her as accepting it. Marjory was too\r\nthorough a child to be vulgarised in that way, even in thought.\r\n\r\nThe others were healthy, matter-of-fact youths, to whom Marjory was an\r\nordinary girl, and who certainly did not indulge in any strained\r\nsentiment respecting her; it was left for me to idealise her; but of\r\nthat, at least, I cannot feel ashamed, or believe that it did me\r\nanything but good.\r\n\r\nAnd the days went on, until it wanted but a fortnight to Christmas, and\r\nmost of us were thinking of the coming holidays, and preparing with a\r\nnot unpleasant excitement for the examinations, which were all that\r\nbarred the way to them now. I was to spend my Christmas with my uncle\r\nand cousins, who would by that time be able to receive me; but I felt no\r\nvery pleasurable anticipations, for my cousins were all boys, and from\r\nboys I thought I knew what to expect.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Ormsby came to me with the request that I would execute a\r\ntrifling commission for him in the adjoining village; he himself, he\r\nsaid, was confined to bounds, but he had a shilling he wanted to lay out\r\nat a small fancy-shop we were allowed to patronise, and he considered me\r\nthe best person to be entrusted with that coin. I was simply to spend\r\nthe money on anything I thought best, for he had entire confidence, he\r\ngave me to understand, in my taste and judgment. I think I suspected a\r\ndesign of some sort, but I did not dare to refuse, and then his manner\r\nto some extent disarmed me.\r\n\r\nI took the shilling, therefore, with which I bought some article--I\r\nforget what--and got back to the school at dusk. The boys had all gone\r\ndown to tea except Ormsby, who was waiting for me up in the empty\r\nschoolroom.\r\n\r\n'Well?' he said, and I displayed my purchase, only to find that I had\r\nfallen into a trap.\r\n\r\nWhen I think how easily I was the dupe of that not too subtle artifice,\r\nwhich was only half malicious, I could smile, if I did not know how it\r\nended.\r\n\r\n'How much was that?' he asked contemptuously, 'twopence-halfpenny? Well,\r\nif you choose to give a shilling for it, I'm not going to pay, that's\r\nall. So just give me back my shilling!'\r\n\r\nNow, as my weekly allowance consisted of threepence, which was\r\nconfiscated for some time in advance (as I think he knew), to provide\r\nfines for my mysteriously-stained dictionaries, this was out of the\r\nquestion, as I represented.\r\n\r\n'Then go back to the shop and change it,' said he; 'I won't have that\r\nthing!'\r\n\r\n'Tell me what you would like instead, and I will,' I stipulated, not\r\nunreasonably.\r\n\r\nHe laughed; his little scheme was working so admirably. 'That's not the\r\nbargain,' he said; 'you're bound to get me something I like. I'm not\r\nobliged to tell you what it is.'\r\n\r\nBut even I was driven to protest against such flagrant unfairness. 'I\r\ndidn't know you meant that,' I said, 'or I'm sure I shouldn't have gone.\r\nI went to oblige _you_, Ormsby.'\r\n\r\n'No, you didn't,' he said, 'you went because I told you. And you'll go\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\n'Not unless you tell me what I'm to get,' I said.\r\n\r\n'I tell you what I believe,' he said; 'you never spent the whole\r\nshilling at all on that; you bought something for yourself with the\r\nrest, you young swindler! No wonder you won't go back to the shop.'\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, a mere taunt flung out by his inventive fancy; but\r\nas he persisted in it, and threatened exposure and a variety of\r\nconsequences, I became alarmed, for I had little doubt that, innocent as\r\nI was, I could be made very uncomfortable by accusations which would\r\nfind willing hearers.\r\n\r\nHe stood there enjoying my perplexity and idly twisting a piece of\r\nstring round and round his fingers. At length he said, 'Well, I don't\r\nwant to be hard on you. You may go and change this for me even now, if\r\nyou like. I'll give you three minutes to think it over, and you can come\r\ndown into the playground when I sing out, and tell me what you mean to\r\ndo. And you had better be sharp in coming, too, or it will be the worse\r\nfor you.'\r\n\r\nHe took his cap, and presently I heard him going down the steps to the\r\nplayground. I would have given worlds to go and join the rest at tea,\r\nbut I did not dare, and remained in the schoolroom, which was dim just\r\nthen, for the gas was lowered; and while I stood there by the fireplace,\r\ntrembling in the cold air which stole in through the door Ormsby had\r\nleft open, Marjory came in by the other one, and was going straight to\r\nher father's desk, when she saw me.\r\n\r\nHer first impulse seemed to be to take no notice, but something in my\r\nface or attitude made her alter her mind and come straight to me,\r\nholding out her hand.\r\n\r\n'Cameron,' she said, 'shall we be friends again?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Marjory,' I said; I could not have said any more just then.\r\n\r\n'You look so miserable, I couldn't bear it any longer,' she said, 'so I\r\n_had_ to make it up. You know, I was only pretending crossness, Cameron,\r\nall the time, because I really thought it was best. But it doesn't seem\r\nto have done you much good, and I did promise to take care of you. What\r\nis it? Ormsby again?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I said, and told her the story of the commission.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you stupid boy!' she cried, 'couldn't you see he only wanted to\r\npick a quarrel? And if you change it now, he'll make you change it\r\nagain, and the next time, and the next after that--I know he will!'\r\n\r\nHere Ormsby's voice shouted from below, 'Now then, you, Cameron, time's\r\nup!'\r\n\r\n'What is he doing down there?' asked Marjory, and her indignation rose\r\nhigher when she heard.\r\n\r\n'Now, Cameron, be brave; go down and tell him once for all he may just\r\nkeep what he has, and be thankful. Whatever it is, it's good enough for\r\n_him_, I'm sure!'\r\n\r\nBut I still hung back. 'It's no use, Marjory, he'll tell everyone I\r\ncheated him--he says he will!'\r\n\r\n'That he shall not!' she cried; 'I won't have it, I'll go myself, and\r\ntell him what I think of him, and make him stop treating you like this.'\r\n\r\nSome faint glimmer of manliness made me ashamed to allow her thus to\r\nfight my battles. 'No, Marjory, not you!' I said; 'I will go: I'll say\r\nwhat you want me to say!'\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. I saw her for just a second at the door, my\r\nimpetuous, generous little Marjory, as she flung back her pretty hair in\r\na certain spirited way she had, and nodded to me encouragingly.\r\n\r\nAnd then--I can hardly think of it calmly even now--there came a sharp\r\nscream, and the sound of a fall, and, after that, silence.\r\n\r\nSick with fear, I rushed to the head of the steps, and looked down into\r\nthe brown gloom.\r\n\r\n'Keep where you are for a minute!' I heard Ormsby cry out. 'It's all\r\nright--she's not hurt; now you can come down.'\r\n\r\nI was down in another instant, at the foot of the stairs, where, in a\r\npatch of faint light that fell from the door above, lay Marjory, with\r\nOrmsby bending over her insensible form.\r\n\r\n'She's dead!' I cried in my terror, as I saw her white face.\r\n\r\n'I tell you she's all right,' said he, impatiently; 'there's nothing to\r\nmake a fuss about. She slipped coming down and cut her forehead--that's\r\nall.'\r\n\r\n'Marjory, speak to me--don't look like that; tell me you're not much\r\nhurt!' I implored her; but she only moaned a little, and her eyes\r\nremained fast shut.\r\n\r\n'It's no use worrying her now, you know,' said Ormsby, more gently.\r\n'Just help me to get her round to the kitchen door, and tell somebody.'\r\n\r\nWe carried her there between us, and, amidst a scene of terrible\r\nconfusion and distress, Marjory, still insensible, was carried into the\r\nlibrary, and a man sent off in hot haste for the surgeon.\r\n\r\nA little later Ormsby and I were sent for to the study, where Dr.\r\nDering, whose face was white and drawn as I had never seen it before,\r\nquestioned us closely as to our knowledge of the accident.\r\n\r\nOrmsby could only say that he was out in the playground, when he saw\r\nsomebody descending the steps, and heard a fall, after which he ran up\r\nand found Marjory.\r\n\r\n'I sent her into the schoolroom to bring my paper-knife,' said the\r\nDoctor; 'if I had but gone myself--! But why should she have gone\r\noutside on a frosty night like this?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Dr. Dering!' I broke out, 'I'm afraid--I'm afraid she went for me!'\r\n\r\nI saw Ormsby's face as I spoke, and there was a look upon it which made\r\nme pity him.\r\n\r\n'And you sent my poor child out on your errand, Cameron! Could you not\r\nhave done it yourself?'\r\n\r\n'I wish I had!' I exclaimed; 'oh, I wish I had! I tried to stop her,\r\nand then--and then it was too late. Please tell me, sir, is she badly\r\nhurt?'\r\n\r\n'How can I tell?' he said harshly; 'there, I can't speak of this just\r\nyet: go, both of you.'\r\n\r\nThere was little work done at evening preparation that night; the whole\r\nschool was buzzing with curiosity and speculation, as we heard doors\r\nopening and shutting around, and the wheels of the doctor's gig as it\r\nrolled up the chestnut avenue.\r\n\r\nI sat with my hands shielding my eyes and ears, engaged to all\r\nappearance with the books before me, while my restless thoughts were\r\nemployed in making earnest resolutions for the future.\r\n\r\nAt last I saw my cowardice in its true light, and felt impatient to tell\r\nMarjory that I did so, to prove to her that I had really reformed; but\r\nwhen would an opportunity come? I might not see her again for days,\r\nperhaps not at all till after the holidays; but I would not let myself\r\ndwell upon such a contingency as that, and, to banish it, tried to\r\npicture what Marjory would say, and how she would look, when I was\r\nallowed to see her again.\r\n\r\nAfter evening prayers, read by one of the assistant-masters, for the\r\nDoctor did not appear again, we were enjoined to go up to our bedrooms\r\nwith as little noise as possible, and we had been in bed some time\r\nbefore Sutcliffe, the old butler, came up as usual to put out the\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion he was assailed by a fire of eager whispers from every\r\ndoor: 'Sutcliffe, hi! old Sutty, how is she?' but he did not seem to\r\nhear, until a cry louder than the rest brought him to our room.\r\n\r\n'For God's sake, gentlemen, don't!' he said, in a hoarse whisper, as he\r\nturned out the light; 'they'll hear you downstairs.'\r\n\r\n'But how is she? do you know--better?'\r\n\r\n'Ay,' he said, 'she's better. She'll be over her trouble soon, will Miss\r\nMarjory!'\r\n\r\nA low murmur of delight ran round the room, which the butler tried to\r\ncheck in vain.\r\n\r\n'Don't!' he said again, 'wait--wait till morning.... Go to sleep quiet\r\nnow, and I'll come up first thing and tell you.'\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner turned his back than the general relief broke out\r\nirrepressibly; Ormsby being especially demonstrative. 'Didn't I tell you\r\nfellows so?' he said triumphantly; 'as if it was likely a plucky girl\r\nlike Marjory would mind a little cut like that. She'll be all right in\r\nthe morning, you see!'\r\n\r\nBut this confidence jarred upon me, who could not pretend to share it,\r\nuntil I was unable to restrain the torturing anxiety I felt.\r\n\r\n'You're wrong--all of you!' I cried, 'I'm sure she's not better. Didn't\r\nyou hear how Sutcliffe said it? She's _worse_--she may even be dying!'\r\n\r\nI met with the usual treatment of a prophet of evil. 'You young muff,' I\r\nwas told on all sides, 'who asked your opinion? Who are you, to know\r\nbetter than anyone else?'\r\n\r\nOrmsby attacked me hotly for trying to excite a groundless alarm, and I\r\nwas recommended to hold my tongue and go to sleep.\r\n\r\nI said no more, but I could not sleep; the others dropped off one by\r\none, Ormsby being the last; but I lay awake listening and thinking,\r\nuntil the dread and suspense grew past bearing. I _must_ know the truth.\r\nI would go down and find the Doctor, and beg him to tell me; he might be\r\nangry and punish me--but that would be nothing in comparison with the\r\nrelief of knowing my fear was unfounded.\r\n\r\nStealthily I slipped out of bed, stole through the dim room to the door,\r\nand down the old staircase, which creaked under my bare feet. The dog in\r\nthe yard howled as I passed the big window, through which the stars were\r\nsparkling frostily in the keen blue sky. Outside the room in which\r\nMarjory lay, I listened, but could hear nothing. At least she was\r\nsleeping, then, and, relieved already, I went on down to the hall.\r\n\r\nThe big clock on a table there was ticking solemnly, like a slow\r\nfootfall; the lamp was alight, so the Doctor must be still up. With a\r\nheart that beat loudly I went to his study door and lifted my hand to\r\nknock, when from within rose a sound at which the current of my blood\r\nstopped and ran backwards--the terrible, heartbroken grief of a grown\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBoy as I was, I felt that an agony like that was sacred; besides, I\r\nknew the worst then.\r\n\r\nI dragged myself upstairs again, cold to the bones, with a brain that\r\nwas frozen too. My one desire was to reach my bed, cover my face, and\r\nlet the tears flow; though, when I did regain it, no tears and no\r\nthoughts came. I lay there and shivered for some time, with a stony,\r\nstunned sensation, and then I slept--as if Marjory were well.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the bell under the cupola did not clang, and Sutcliffe\r\ncame up with the direction that we were to go down very quietly, and not\r\nto draw up the window-blinds; and then we all knew what had happened\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nThere was a very genuine grief, though none knew Marjory as I had known\r\nher; the more emotional wept, the older ones indulged in little\r\nsemi-pious conventional comments, oddly foreign to their usual tone;\r\nall--even the most thoughtless--felt the same hush and awe overtake\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI could not cry; I felt nothing, except a dull rage at my own\r\ninsensibility. Marjory was dead--and I had no tears.\r\n\r\nMorning school was a mere pretence that day; we dreaded, for almost the\r\nfirst time, to see the Doctor's face, but he did not show himself, and\r\nthe arrangements necessary for the breaking-up of the school were made\r\nby the matron.\r\n\r\nSome, including Ormsby and myself, could not be taken in for some days,\r\nduring which we had to remain at the school: days of shadow and\r\nmonotony, with occasional ghastly outbreaks of the high spirits which\r\nnothing could repress, even in that house of mourning.\r\n\r\nBut the time passed at last, until it was the evening of the day on\r\nwhich Marjory had been left to her last sleep.\r\n\r\nThe poor father and mother had been unable to stay in the house now that\r\nit no longer covered even what had been their child; and the only two,\r\nbesides the matron and a couple of servants who still remained there,\r\nwere Ormsby and I, who were both to leave on the following morning.\r\n\r\nI would rather have been alone just then with anyone but Ormsby, though\r\nhe had never since that fatal night taken the slightest notice of me; he\r\nlooked worn and haggard to a degree that made me sure he must have cared\r\nmore for Marjory than I could have imagined, and yet he would break at\r\ntimes into a feverish gaiety which surprised and repelled me.\r\n\r\nHe was in one of these latter moods that evening, as we sat, as far\r\napart as possible, in the empty, firelit schoolroom.\r\n\r\n'Now, Cameron,' he said, as he came up to me and struck me boisterously\r\non the shoulder, 'wake up, man! I've been in the blues long enough. We\r\ncan't go on moping always, on the night before the holidays, too! Do\r\nsomething to make yourself sociable--talk, can't you?'\r\n\r\n'No, I can't,' I said; and, breaking from him, went to one of the\r\nwindows and looked vacantly out into blackness, which reflected the long\r\nroom, with its dingy greenish maps, and the desks and forms glistening\r\nin the fire-beams.\r\n\r\nThe ice-bound state in which I had been so long was slowly passing away,\r\nnow that the scene by the little grave that raw, cheerless morning had\r\nbrought home remorselessly the truth that Marjory was indeed gone--lost\r\nto me for ever.\r\n\r\nI could see now what she had been to me; how she had made my great\r\nloneliness endurable; how, with her innocent, fearless nature, she had\r\ntried to rouse me from spiritless and unmanly dejection. And I could\r\nnever hope to please her now by proving that I had learnt the lesson;\r\nshe had gone from me to some world infinitely removed, in which I was\r\nforgotten, and my pitiful trials and struggles could be nothing to her\r\nany more!\r\n\r\nI was once more alone, and this second bereavement revived in all its\r\ncrushing desolation the first bitter loss which it so closely followed.\r\n\r\nSo, as I stood there at the window, my unnatural calm could hold out no\r\nlonger; the long-frozen tears thawed, and I could weep for the first\r\ntime since Marjory died.\r\n\r\nBut I was not allowed to sorrow undisturbed; I felt a rough grasp on my\r\narm, as Ormsby asked me angrily, 'What's the matter now?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Marjory, come to me!' I could only cry; 'I can't bear it! I can't!\r\nI can't!'\r\n\r\n'Stop that, do you hear?' he said savagely, 'I won't have it! Who are\r\nyou to cry about her, when--but for _you_----'\r\n\r\nHe got no farther; the bitter truth in such a taunt, coming from him,\r\nstung me to ungovernable rage. I turned and struck him full in the\r\nmouth, which I cut open with my clenched hand.\r\n\r\nHis eyes became all pupil. 'You shall pay me for that!' he said through\r\nhis teeth; and, forcing me against a desk, he caught up a large T-square\r\nwhich lay near; he was far the stronger, and I felt myself powerless in\r\nhis grasp. Passion and pain had made him beside himself for the moment,\r\nand he did not know how formidable a weapon the heavily-weighted\r\ninstrument might become in his hand.\r\n\r\nI shut my eyes: I think I rather hoped he would kill me, and then\r\nperhaps I might go where Marjory was. I did not cry for help, and it\r\nwould have been useless if I had done so, for the schoolroom was a long\r\nway from the kitchen and offices of that rambling old house.\r\n\r\nBut before the expected blow was dealt I felt his grasp relax, and heard\r\nthe instrument fall with a sudden clatter on the floor. 'Look,' he\r\nwhispered, in a voice I did not recognise, '_look there_!'\r\n\r\nAnd when I opened my eyes, I saw Marjory standing between us!\r\n\r\nShe looked just as I had always seen her: I suppose that even the\r\nafter-life could not make Marjory look purer, or more lovely than she\r\nwas on earth. My first feeling was a wild conviction that it had all\r\nbeen some strange mistake--that Marjory was not dead.\r\n\r\n'Marjory, Marjory!' I cried in my joy, 'is it really you? You have come\r\nback, after all, and it is not true!'\r\n\r\nShe looked at us both without speaking for a moment; her dear brown eyes\r\nhad lost their old childish sparkle, and were calm and serious as if\r\nwith a deeper knowledge.\r\n\r\nOrmsby had cowered back to the opposite wall, covering his face. 'Go\r\naway!' he gasped. 'Cameron--_you_ ask her to go. She--she liked you....\r\nI never meant it. Tell her I never meant to do it!'\r\n\r\nI could not understand such terror at the sight of Marjory, even if she\r\nhad been what he thought her; but there was a reason in his case.\r\n\r\n'You were going to hurt Cameron,' said Marjory, at length, and her voice\r\nsounded sad and grave and far-away.\r\n\r\n'I don't care, Marjory,' I cried, 'not now you are here!'\r\n\r\nShe motioned me back: 'You must not come nearer,' she said. 'I cannot\r\nstay long, and I must speak to Ormsby. Ormsby, have you told anyone?'\r\n\r\n'No,' he said, shaking all over, 'it could do no good.... I thought I\r\nneedn't.'\r\n\r\n'Tell _him_,' said Marjory.\r\n\r\n'Must I? Oh, no, no!' he groaned, 'don't make me do that!'\r\n\r\n'You must,' she answered, and he turned to me with a sullen fear.\r\n\r\n'It was like this,' he began; 'that night, when I was waiting for you\r\ndown there--I had some string, and it struck me, all in a moment, that\r\nit would be fun to trip you up. I didn't mean to hurt you--only frighten\r\nyou. I fastened the string across a little way from the bottom. And\r\nthen'--he had to moisten his lips before he could go on--'then _she_\r\ncame down, and I tried to catch her--and couldn't--no, I couldn't!'\r\n\r\n'Is that all?' asked Marjory, as he stopped short.\r\n\r\n'I cut the string and hid it before you came. Now you know, and you may\r\ntell if you like!'\r\n\r\n'Cameron, you will never tell, will you--as long as he lives?' said\r\nMarjory. 'You must promise.'\r\n\r\nI was horrified by what I had heard; but her eyes were upon me, and I\r\npromised.\r\n\r\n'And you, Ormsby, promise me to be kinder to him after this.'\r\n\r\nHe could not speak; but he made a sign of assent.\r\n\r\n'And now,' said Marjory, 'shake hands with him and forgive him.'\r\n\r\nBut I revolted: 'No, Marjory, I can't; not now--when I know this!'\r\n\r\n'Cameron, dear,' she said, 'you won't let me go away sorry, will you?\r\nand I must go so soon. For my sake, when I wish it so!'\r\n\r\nI went to Ormsby, and took his cold, passive hand. 'I do forgive him,\r\nMarjory,' I said.\r\n\r\nShe smiled brightly at us both. 'And you won't forget, either of you?'\r\nshe said. 'And, Douglas, you will be brave, and take your own part now.\r\nGood-bye, good-bye.'\r\n\r\nI tried to reach her. 'Don't leave me; take me with you, Marjory--dear,\r\ndear Marjory, don't go!' But there was only firelit space where she had\r\nstood, though the sound of her pleading, pathetic voice was still in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nOrmsby remained for a few minutes leaning against a desk, with his face\r\nburied in his arms, and I heard him struggling with his sobs. At last he\r\nrose, and left the room without a word.\r\n\r\nBut I stayed there where I had last seen Marjory, till the fire died\r\ndown, and the hour was late, for I was glad to be alone with the new and\r\nsolemn joy that had come to me. For she had not forgotten me where she\r\nwas; I had been allowed to see her once more, and it might even be that\r\nI should see her again. And I resolved then that when she came she\r\nshould find me more worthy of her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom that night my character seemed to enter upon a new phase, and when\r\nI returned to school it was to begin my second term under better\r\nauspices.\r\n\r\nMy cousins had welcomed me cordially among them, and as I mastered the\r\nlesson of give and take, of respecting one's self in respecting others,\r\nwhich I needed to learn, my early difficulties vanished with the\r\nweakness that had produced them.\r\n\r\nBy Ormsby I was never again molested; in word and deed, he was true to\r\nthe promise exacted from him during that last strange scene. At first,\r\nhe avoided me as being too painfully connected with the past; but by\r\ndegrees, as he recognised that his secret was safe in my keeping, we\r\ngrew to understand one another better, although it would be too much to\r\nsay that we ever became intimate.\r\n\r\nAfter he went to Sandhurst I lost sight of him, and only a few months\r\nsince the news of his death in the Soudan, where he fell gallantly, made\r\nme sorrowfully aware that we should never meet again.\r\n\r\nI had a lingering fancy that Marjory might appear to me once more, but I\r\nhave long since given up all hope of that in this life, and for what may\r\ncome after I am content to wait.\r\n\r\nBut the charge my child-friend had undertaken was completed on the night\r\nshe was allowed to return to earth and determine the crisis of two\r\nlives; there is nothing now to call the bright and gracious little\r\nspirit back, for her influence will remain always.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Spottiswoode & Co.

They were indebted for a clue to the real names of the most\r\ninteresting scenes to a friend of the Brontë family, who enabled the\r\nartist, Mr. G. M. Wimperis, to identify the places described. He made\r\nfaithful sketches of them on the spot, and drew them on wood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1.--+JANE EYRE.+ By Charlotte Brontë.
