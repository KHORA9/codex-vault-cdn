It is furnished in front with an opening--often very\r\nsmall--which is the mouth; and with some for the eyes, and with others\r\nfor the insertion of the antennæ or horns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Head of an Insect]\r\n\r\nThe integuments of the head are generally harder than the other\r\nparts of the body. It is necessary that this should be so. Insects\r\noften live and die in the midst of substances which offer some\r\nresistance. It is necessary, therefore, that the head should be strong\r\nenough to overcome such resistance. The head contains the masticatory\r\norgans, which, frequently having to attack hard substances, must be\r\nstrongly supported. The exception to this rule is among insects which\r\nlive by suction.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place here to mention the numerous modifications\r\nof the head which are presented in the immense class of insects.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of insects are of two kinds. There are compound eyes, or eyes\r\ncomposed of many lenses, united by their margins and forming hexagonal\r\nfacettes; and there are also simple eyes, or ocelli.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the eye is called the cornea (Fig. 2), each facette\r\nbeing a cornea; and the facettes, which vary in size even in the same\r\neye, unite and form a common cornea, which is represented by the\r\nentire figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--A Compound Cornea.]\r\n\r\nIn order to show the immense number of the facettes possessed by many\r\ninsects, we give the following list:--\r\n\r\n  In the genus Mordella (a genus of beetles) the eye has 25,008 facettes.\r\n  In the _Libellula_ (dragon-fly)                        12,544    \"\r\n  In the genus _Papilio_ (a genus of butterflies)        17,355    \"\r\n  In _Sphinx convolvuli_ (the convolvulus hawk-moth)      1,300    \"\r\n  In _Bombyx mori_ (the common silkworm moth)             6,236    \"\r\n  In the house-fly                                        4,000    \"\r\n  In the ant                                                 50    \"\r\n  In the cockchafer                                       8,820    \"\r\n\r\nThe facettes appear to be most numerous in insects of the genus\r\n_Scarabæus_ (a genus of beetles). They are so minute, that they can\r\nonly be detected with a magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nLooked at in front, a compound eye may be considered an agglomeration\r\nof simple eyes; but internally this is hardly correct.\r\n\r\nOn the under side of each facette we find a body of a gelatinous\r\nappearance, transparent, and usually conical; the base of this\r\noccupies the centre of the facette in such a manner as to leave around\r\nit a ring to receive some colouring matter. This body diminishes in\r\nthickness towards its other extremity, and terminates in a point where\r\nit joins a nervous filament proceeding from the optic nerve. These\r\ncones, agreeing in number with the facettes, play the part of the\r\ncrystalline lens in the eyes of animals. They are straight and\r\nparallel with each other. A pigment fills all the spaces between the\r\ncones, and between the nervous filaments, and covers the under side of\r\neach cornea, except at the centre. This pigment varies much in colour.\r\nThere are almost always two layers, of which the exterior one is the\r\nmore brilliant. In fact, these eyes often sparkle with fire, like\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\nM. Lacordaire, in his \"Introduction à l'Entomologie,\" from which we\r\nborrow the greater part of this information, has summed up as follows,\r\nthe manner in which, according to M. Müller, the visual organs of\r\ninsects operate:--\r\n\r\n\"Each facette, with its lens and nervous filament, separated from\r\nthose surrounding them by the pigment in which they are enclosed, form\r\nan isolated apparatus, impenetrable to all rays of light, except those\r\nwhich fall perpendicularly on the centre of the facette, which alone\r\nis devoid of pigment. All rays falling obliquely are absorbed by that\r\npigment which surrounds the gelatinous cone. It results partly from\r\nthis, and partly from the immobility of the eye, that the field of\r\nvision of each facette is very limited, and that there are as many\r\nobjects reflected on the optic filaments as there are corneæ. The\r\nextent, then, of the field of vision will be determined, not by the\r\ndiameter of these last, but by the diameter of the entire eye, and\r\nwill be in proportion to its size and convexity. But whatever may be\r\nthe size of the eyes, like their fields of vision, they are\r\nindependent of each other; there is always a space, greater or less,\r\nbetween them; and the insect cannot see objects in front of this space\r\nwithout turning its head. What a peculiar sensation must result from\r\nthe multiplicity of images on the optic filaments! This is not more\r\neasily explained than that which happens with animals which, having\r\ntwo eyes, see only one image; and probably the same is the case\r\nwith insects. But these eyes usually look in opposite directions,\r\nand should see two images, as in the chameleon, whose eyes move\r\nindependently of each other. The clearness and length of vision will\r\ndepend, continues M. Müller, on the diameter of the sphere of which\r\nthe entire eye forms a segment, on the number and size of the\r\nfacettes, and the length of the cones or lenses. The larger each\r\nfacette, taken separately, and the more brilliant the pigment placed\r\nbetween the lenses, the more distinct will be the image of objects at\r\na distance, and the less distinct that of objects near. With the\r\nlatter the luminous rays diverge considerably; while those from the\r\nformer are more parallel. In the first case, in traversing the\r\npigment, they impinge obliquely on the crystalline, and consequently\r\nconfuse the vision; in the second, they fall more perpendicularly on\r\neach facette.\r\n\r\n\"Objects do not appear of the same size to each optic filament, unless\r\nthe eye is a perfect section of a sphere, and its convexity concentric\r\nwith that of the optic nerve. Whenever it is otherwise, the image\r\ncorresponds more or less imperfectly with the size of the object, and\r\nis more or less incorrect. Hence it follows, that elliptical or\r\nconical eyes, which one generally finds among insects, are less\r\nperfect than those referred to above.\r\n\r\n\"The differences which exist in the organisation of the eye among\r\ninsects are explicable, to a certain point, on the theory which we are\r\nabout to explain in a few words. Those species which live in the same\r\nsubstances on which they feed, and those which are parasitical, have\r\nsmall and flattened eyes; those, on the contrary, which have to seek\r\ntheir food, and which need to see objects at a distance, have large or\r\nvery convex eyes. For the same reason the males, which have to seek\r\ntheir females, have larger eyes than the latter. The position of the\r\neyes depends also on their size and shape; those which are flat, and\r\nhave consequently a short field of vision, are placed close together,\r\nand rather in front than at the sides of the head, and often\r\nadjoining. Spherical and convex eyes, on the contrary, are placed on\r\nthe sides, and their axes are opposite. But the greater field of\r\nvision which they are able to take in makes up for this position.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost all insects are provided with a pair of compound eyes, which\r\nare placed on the sides of the head. The size and form of these organs\r\nare very variable, as we shall presently see. They are generally\r\nplaced behind the antennæ.\r\n\r\nAlthough simple eyes (ocelli or stemmata) are common, they do not\r\nexist in all the orders of insects. They are generally round, and more\r\nor less convex and black, and there are three in the majority of\r\ncases. When there is this number they are most frequently placed in a\r\ntriangle behind, and at a greater or less distance from the antennæ.\r\nUnder the cornea, which varies in convexity, is found a transparent,\r\nrather hard, and nearly globular body, which is the true crystalline\r\nresting on a mass, which represents the vitreous body. This vitreous\r\nbody is enclosed in an expansion of the optic nerve. Besides these,\r\nthere is a pigment, most frequently red-brown, sometimes black, or\r\nblood-red. The organisation of these eyes is analogous to the eyes of\r\nfishes, and their refractive power is very great.\r\n\r\nWith these eyes insects can only see such objects as are at a short\r\ndistance. Of what use then can stemmata be to insects also provided\r\nwith compound eyes? It has been remarked that most insects having\r\nthis arrangement of eyes feed on the pollen of plants, and it has\r\nbeen surmised that the stemmata enable them to distinguish the parts\r\nof the flowers.\r\n\r\nThe antennæ, commonly called horns, are two flexible appendages,\r\nof very variable form, which are joined to different parts of the\r\nhead, and are always two in number. The joints of which they are made\r\nup have the power of motion, which enables the insect to move them in\r\nany direction.\r\n\r\nThe antennæ consist of three parts: the basal joint, commonly\r\ndistinguished by its form, length, and colour; the club, formed by a\r\ngradual or sudden thickening of the terminal joints, of which the\r\nnumber, form, and size present great variations; lastly, the stalk,\r\nformed by all the joints of the antennæ, except the basal, when no\r\nclub exists, and in case of the existence of a club, of all those\r\nbetween it and the basal one.\r\n\r\nWe give as examples the antennæ of two beetles, one of the genus\r\n_Asida_, the other of the genus _Zygia_ (Figs. 3 and 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Antenna of a species of Asida.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Antenna of Zygia oblonga.]\r\n\r\nInsects, for the most part, while in repose, place their antennæ on\r\ntheir backs, or along the sides of the head, or even on the thorax.\r\nOthers are provided with cavities in which the antennæ repose either\r\nwholly or in part.\r\n\r\nDuring their different movements, insects move their antennæ more or\r\nless, sometimes slowly and with regularity, at other times in all\r\ndirections. Some insects impart to their antennæ a perpetual\r\nvibration. During flight they are directed in front, perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the body, or else they repose on the back.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of the antennæ, resembling as they do, feathers, saws,\r\nclubs, &c.? Everything indicates that these organs play a very\r\nimportant part in the life of insects, but their functions are\r\nimperfectly understood. Experience has shown that they only play a\r\nsubordinate part as feelers, and have nothing to do with the senses of\r\ntaste or smell. There is no other function for them to fulfil, except\r\nthat of hearing.\r\n\r\nOn this hypothesis the antennæ will be the principal instruments for\r\nthe transmission of sound-waves. The membrane at their base represents\r\na trace of the tympanum which exists among the higher animals. This\r\nmembrane then will have some connection with an auditory nerve.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of insects is formed after two general types, which\r\ncorrespond to two kinds of requirements. It is suited in the one case\r\nto break solid substances, in the other to imbibe liquids.\r\n\r\nAt first sight there seems no similarity between the mouth of a biting\r\ninsect and of one living by suction. But on examination it is found\r\nthat the parts of the mouth in the one are exactly analogous to the\r\nsame parts in the other, and that they have only modifications suiting\r\nthem to the different purposes which they have to fulfil.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of a biting insect is composed of an upper lip, a pair of\r\nmandibles, a pair of jaws, and a lower lip (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Mouth of a masticating insect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Thorax of Acrocinus longimanus (a beetle).]\r\n\r\nThe lower lip and the jaws carry on the outside certain appendages or\r\nfilaments which have received the name of _palpi_.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of sucking insects, and in general of the various orders\r\nof insects, we shall speak more in detail of the various parts of the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThe thorax (Fig. 6), the second primary division of the body of\r\ninsects, plays almost as important a part as the head. It consists of\r\nthree segments or rings, which are in general joined together--the\r\nprothorax, the mesothorax, and the metathorax, each of which bears a\r\npair of legs. The wings are attached to the two posterior segments.\r\n\r\nAll insects have six true legs. There is no exception whatever to this\r\nrule, though some may not be developed.\r\n\r\nFrom the segments to which they are attached, the legs are called\r\nanterior, posterior, and intermediate. The legs are composed of four\r\nparts: the trochanter, a short joint which unites the thigh to the\r\nbody; the thigh or _femur_; the _tibia_, answering to the shank in\r\nanimals; and the _tarsus_, or foot, composed of a variable number of\r\npieces placed end to end, and called the _phalanges_.\r\n\r\nWe take as examples the hind leg of a _Heterocerus_ (Fig. 7), and the\r\nfront leg of a _Zophosis_ (Fig. 8) (genera of beetles).\r\n\r\nWe shall not dwell on the different parts, as they perform functions\r\nwhich will occupy us later, when speaking of the various species of\r\nthe great class of insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Hind leg of a Heterocerus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Front leg of a Zophosis.]\r\n\r\nThe functions which the legs of insects have to perform consist in\r\nwalking, swimming, or jumping.\r\n\r\nIn walking, says M. Lacordaire, insects move their legs in different\r\nways. Some move their six legs successively, or only two or three at\r\na time without distinction, but never both legs of the same pair\r\ntogether, consequently one step is not the same as another. The walk\r\nof insects is sometimes very irregular, especially when the legs are\r\nlong; and they often hop rather than walk. Others have one kind of\r\nstep, and walk very regularly. They commence by moving the posterior\r\nand anterior legs on the same side and the intermediate ones on the\r\nopposite side. The first step made, these legs are put down, and the\r\nothers raised in their turn to make a second.\r\n\r\nRunning does not change the order of the movements, it only makes them\r\nquicker--very rapid in some species, and surpassing in proportion that\r\nof all other animals; but in others the pace is slow. Some insects\r\nrather crawl than walk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Posterior leg of a jumping insect.]\r\n\r\nIn swimming, the posterior legs play the principal part. The other\r\nlegs striking the water upwards or downwards, produce an upward or\r\ndownward motion. The animal changes its course at will by using the\r\nlegs on one side only, in the same way as one turns a rowing boat with\r\none oar without the aid of a rudder. Swimming differs essentially from\r\nwalking, for the foot being surrounded by a resisting medium, the\r\nlegs on both sides are moved at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe act of jumping is principally performed by the hind legs. Insects\r\nwhich jump have these legs very largely developed, as in Fig. 9. When\r\nabout to jump they bring the tibia into contact with the thigh, which\r\nis often furnished with a groove to receive it, having on each side a\r\nrow of spines. The leg then suddenly straightens like a spring, and\r\nthe foot being placed firmly on the ground, sends the insect into the\r\nair, and at the same time propels forward. The jump is greater in\r\nproportion as the leg is longer.\r\n\r\nTo treat here in a general manner of the wings of insects would be\r\nuseless. We shall refer to them at length in their proper place, when\r\ntreating of the various types of winged insects.\r\n\r\nIn the perfect insect the abdomen does not carry either the wings or\r\nthe legs. It is formed of nine segments, which are without appendages,\r\nwith the exception of the posterior ones, which often carry small\r\norgans differing much in form and function. These are saws, probes,\r\nforceps, stings, augers, &c. We shall consider these different organs\r\nin their proper places.\r\n\r\nWith vertebrate animals, which have an interior skeleton suited to\r\nfurnish points of resistance for their various movements, the skin is\r\na more or less soft covering, uniformly diffused over the exterior of\r\nthe body, and intended only to protect it against external injury. In\r\ninsects the points of resistance are changed from the interior to the\r\nexterior. The skin is altered by Nature to fit it to this purpose. It\r\nis hard, and presents between the segments only membranous intervals,\r\nwhich allow the hard parts to move in all directions.\r\n\r\nWe are examining a perfect insect; we have glanced at its skeleton,\r\nand the different appendages which spring from it. The principal\r\norgans which are contained in the body remain to be examined.\r\n\r\nWe will first study the digestive apparatus. This apparatus consists\r\nof a lengthened tubular organ, swollen at certain points, forming\r\nmore or less numerous convolutions, and provided with two distinct\r\norifices. This alimentary canal is always situated in the median line\r\nof the body, traverses its whole length, and is at first surrounded\r\nby, and then passes above, the nervous ganglia.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Ganglion_--a mass, literally a knot, of nervous matter.\r\n\r\nIn its most complicated form the alimentary canal is composed of an\r\n_oesophagus_, or gullet, of a crop, of a gizzard, of a chylific\r\nventricle or stomach, a small intestine, a large intestine, divers\r\nappendages, salivary, biliary, and urinary glands. The oesophagus\r\nis often not wider than a hair, and part of it in many species is\r\nenlarged into a pouch, which is called the crop, because it occupies\r\nthe same position, and performs analogous functions with that organ in\r\nbirds. It is enough to say that the food remains there some time\r\nbefore passing on to the other parts of the intestinal canal, and\r\nundergoes a certain amount of preparation. It is in the gizzard, when\r\none exists, that the food, separated by the masticatory organs of the\r\nmouth, undergoes another and more complete grinding. Its structure is\r\nsuited to its office. It is, in fact, very muscular, often half\r\ncartilaginous, and strongly contractile. Its interior walls are\r\nprovided with a grinding apparatus, which varies according to the\r\nspecies, and consists of teeth, plates, spines, and notches, which\r\nconvert the food into pulp. It only exists among insects which live\r\non solid matters, hard vegetables, small animals, tough skin, &c. This\r\napparatus is absent in sucking insects and those which live on soft\r\nsubstances, such as the pollen of flowers, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Digestive apparatus of Carabus auratus.]\r\n\r\nThe chylific ventricle or stomach is never absent; it is the organ\r\nwhich performs the principal part in the act of digestion.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of appendages belong to the chylific ventricle, but only in\r\ncertain families. The first are papillæ, in the form of the fingers of\r\na glove, which bristle over the exterior of this organ, and in which\r\nit is believed that the food begins to be converted into chyle. The\r\nsecond are cæca, and larger and less numerous.\r\n\r\nThey have been considered as secretory organs, answering to the\r\npancreas in vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nFig. 10, which represents the digestive apparatus of _Carabus\r\nauratus_, a common beetle, presents to the eyes of the reader the\r\ndifferent organs of which we are speaking.\r\n\r\nA is the mouth of the insect, B the oesophagus, C the crop, D the\r\ngizzard, E the chylific ventricle, F and G the small and large\r\nintestines, and H the anus.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to consider the other parts of the alimentary\r\ncanal in insects, but only to refer to some of the appendages of this\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe salivary glands pour into the digestive tube a liquid, generally\r\ncolourless, which, from the place where it is secreted, and its\r\nalkaline nature, corresponds to the saliva in vertebrate animals. It\r\nis this liquid which comes from the tongue of sucking insects in the\r\nform of drops.\r\n\r\nThese glands are always two in number. Their form is as variable\r\nas complicated. The most simple is that of a closed flexible tube,\r\ngenerally rolled into a ball, and opening on the sides of the\r\noesophagus.\r\n\r\nAt the posterior extremity of the chylific ventricle are inserted\r\na variable number of fine tubes, usually elongated and flexible,\r\nand terminating in _culs-de-sac_ at one end. Their colour, which\r\ndepends on the liquid they may contain, is sometimes white, but more\r\nfrequently brown, blackish, or green. They appear to be composed of a\r\nvery slight and delicate membrane, as they are very easily torn, and\r\nnothing is more difficult than to unroll and to disengage them from\r\nthe fatty or other tissues by which they are enveloped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Posterior extremity of the chylific\r\nventricle, surrounded by the Malpighian vessels.]\r\n\r\nThe function of these vessels is uncertain. Cuvier and Léon Dufour\r\nsupposed them to be analogous to the liver, and on that account they\r\nhave been called biliary vessels; and they are often termed the\r\nMalpighian vessels, after the name of their discoverer.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Lacordaire, their functions vary with their position.\r\nWhen they enter the chylific ventricle, they furnish only bile; bile\r\nand a urinary liquid when they enter the posterior part of the\r\nventricle and the intestine; and urine alone when they are placed near\r\nthe posterior extremity of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nFig. 11 represents part of the preceding figure more highly magnified,\r\nshowing the manner in which these tubes enter the chylific ventricle.\r\n\r\nIn our rapid description of the digestive apparatus of insects, it\r\nonly remains for us to mention certain purifying organs which secrete\r\nthose fluids, generally blackish, caustic, or of peculiar smell, which\r\nsome insects emit when they are irritated, and which cause a smarting\r\nwhen they get into one's eyes.\r\n\r\nLess well developed than the salivary organs, they are often of a very\r\ncomplicated structure. In Fig. 12 is represented the secretory\r\napparatus of the _Carabus auratus_, which will serve for an example: A\r\nrepresents the secretory sacs aggregated together like a bunch of\r\ngrapes, B the canal, C the pouch which receives the secretion, D the\r\nexcretory duct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Secretory apparatus of Carabus auratus.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the secretion is liquid, and has a foetid or ammoniacal\r\nodour; sometimes, as in the Bombardier beetle (_Brachinus crepitans_),\r\nit is gaseous, and is emitted, with an explosion, in the form of a\r\nwhitish vapour, having a strong pungent odour analogous to that of\r\nnitric acid, and the same properties. It reddens litmus paper, and\r\nburns and reddens the skin, which after a time becomes brown, and\r\ncontinues so for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the seventeenth century Malpighi at Bologna, and\r\nSwammerdam at Utrecht, discovered a pulsatory organ occupying a median\r\nline of the back, which appeared to them to be a heart, in different\r\ninsects. Nevertheless, Cuvier, having declared some time afterwards\r\nthat there was no circulation, properly so called, among insects, his\r\nopinion was universally adopted.\r\n\r\nBut in 1827 a German naturalist named Carus discovered that there were\r\nreal currents of blood circulating throughout the body, and returning\r\nto their point of departure. The observations of Carus were repeated\r\nand confirmed by many other naturalists, and we are thus enabled to\r\nform a sufficiently exact idea of the manner in which the blood\r\ncirculates.\r\n\r\nThe following summary of the phenomena of circulation among insects is\r\nborrowed from \"Leçons sur la Physiologie et l'Anatomie comparée,\" by\r\nM. Milne-Edwards:--\r\n\r\nThe tube which passes under the skin of the back of the head, and\r\nfront part of the body, above the alimentary canal, has been known for\r\na long time as the dorsal vessel. It is composed of two very distinct\r\nportions: the anterior, which is tubular and not contractile; and the\r\nposterior, which is larger, of more complicated structure, and which\r\ncontracts and dilates at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nThis latter part constitutes, then, more particularly the heart of\r\nthe insect. Generally it occupies the whole length of the abdomen,\r\nand is fixed to the vault of the tegumentary skeleton by membranous\r\nexpansions, in such a manner as to leave a free space around it, but\r\nshut above and below, so as to form a reservoir into which the blood\r\npours before penetrating to the heart. This reservoir is often called\r\nthe auricle, for it seems to act as an instrument of impulsion, and to\r\ndrive the blood into the ventricle or heart, properly so called.\r\n\r\nThe heart is fusiform, and is divided by numerous constrictions into\r\nchambers. These chambers have exits placed in pairs, and membranous\r\nfolds which divide the cavity in the manner of a portcullis. The lips\r\nof the orifices, instead of terminating in a clean edge, penetrate\r\ninto the interior of the heart in the form of the mouth-piece of a\r\nflute. The double membranous folds thus formed on each side of the\r\ndorsal vessel are in the shape of a half moon, and separate from each\r\nother when this organ dilates; but the contrary movement taking place,\r\nthe passage is closed.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of this valvular apparatus, the blood can penetrate into\r\nthe heart from the pericardic chamber, the empty space surrounding the\r\nheart, but cannot flow back from the heart into that reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe anterior or aortic portion of the dorsal vessels shows neither\r\nfan-shaped lateral expansions, nor orifices, and consists of a\r\nsingle membranous tube. The whole of the blood set in motion by the\r\ncontractions of the cardial portion of the dorsal vessel runs into the\r\ncavity of the head, and circulates afterwards in irregular channels\r\nformed by the empty spaces left between the different organs. It is\r\nthe unoccupied portions of the great visceral cavity which serve as\r\nchannels for the blood, and through them run the main currents to the\r\nlateral and lower parts of the body. These currents regain the back\r\npart of the abdomen, and enter the heart after having passed over the\r\ninternal organs. These principal channels are in continuity with other\r\ngaps between the muscles, or between the bundles of fibres of which\r\nthese muscles are composed.\r\n\r\nThe principal currents send into the network thus formed, minor\r\nbranches, which having ramified in their turn among the principal\r\nparts of the organism, re-enter some main current to regain the dorsal\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nIn the transparent parts of the body the blood may be seen circulating\r\nin this way to a number of inter-organic channels, penetrating\r\nthe limbs and the wings, when these appendages are not horny, and,\r\nin short, diffusing itself everywhere. \"If, by means of coloured\r\ninjections,\" says M. Milne-Edwards, \"one studies the connections which\r\nexist between the cavities in which sanguineous currents have been\r\nfound to exist and the rest of the economy, it is easy to see that the\r\nirrigatory system thus formed penetrates to the full depth of every\r\norgan, and should cause the rapid renewal of the nourishing fluid in\r\nall the parts where the process of vitality renders the passage of\r\nthis fluid necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see presently, in speaking of respiration, that the relations\r\nbetween the nourishing fluid and the atmospheric air are more direct\r\nand regular than was for a long time supposed.\r\n\r\nIn short, insects possess an active circulation, although we find\r\nneither arteries nor veins, and although the blood put in motion by\r\nthe contractions of the heart, and carried to the head by the aortic\r\nportion of the dorsal vessel, can only distribute itself in the\r\ndifferent parts of the system to return to the heart, by the gaps left\r\nbetween the different organs, or between the membranes and fibres of\r\nwhich these organs are composed.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 (page 14), which shows both the circulating and breathing\r\nsystems of an insect, enables us to recognise the different organs\r\nwhich we have described, as helping to keep up both respiration and\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the respiration of the insect is comparatively a\r\nmodern scientific acquisition. Malpighi was the first to prove, in\r\n1669, that insects are provided with organs of respiration, and that\r\nair is as indispensable to them as it is to other living beings. But\r\nthe opinion of this celebrated naturalist has been contradicted,\r\nand his views were long contested. Now, however, one can easily\r\nrecognise the apparatus by the aid of which the respiration of the\r\ninsect is effected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Organs of circulation and breathing in an\r\ninsect. A, abdominal portion of the dorsal vessel. B, aortic or\r\nthoracic portion. C, air-vessels of the head; D, of the abdomen.]\r\n\r\nThe respiratory apparatus is essentially composed of membranous\r\nducts of great tenuity, their ramifications spread everywhere in\r\nincalculable numbers, and bury themselves in the different organs,\r\nmuch in the same way as the fibrous roots of plants bury themselves in\r\nthe soil. These vessels are called tracheæ. Their communications with\r\nthe air are established externally in different ways, according to the\r\ncharacter of the medium in which the insect lives.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that a vast number of insects live in the air. The\r\nair penetrates into the tracheæ by a number of orifices placed at the\r\nsides of the body, which are termed spiracles. On close examination\r\nthese may be seen in the shape of button-holes in a number of\r\ndifferent species. Let us dwell for a moment on the breathing\r\napparatus of the insect, that is to say, on the tracheæ.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is sometimes composed of elastic tubes only, sometimes\r\nof a collection of tubes and membranous pouches. We will first treat\r\nof the former.\r\n\r\nThe coats of these breathing tubes are very elastic, and always\r\npreserve a cylindrical form, even when not distended. This state of\r\nthings is maintained by the existence, throughout the whole length of\r\nthe tracheæ, of a thread of half horny consistency, rolled up in a\r\nspiral, and covered externally by a very delicate membranous sheath.\r\nThe external membrane is thin, smooth, and generally colourless, or of\r\na pearly white. The cartilaginous spiral is sometimes cylindrical and\r\nsometimes flat. It only adheres slightly to the external membrane,\r\nbut is, on the other hand, closely united to the internal one. This\r\nspiral thread is only continuous in the same trunk; it breaks off when\r\nit branches, and each branch then possesses its own thread, in such a\r\nway that it is not joined to the thread of the trunk from which it\r\nissued, except by continuity, just as the branch of a tree is attached\r\nto the stem which supports it. This thread is prolonged, without\r\ninterruption, to the extreme points of the finest ramifications.\r\n\r\nThe number of tracheæ in the body of an insect is very great. That\r\npatient anatomist, Lyonet, has proved this in his great work on the\r\nGoat-moth Caterpillar, _Cossus ligniperda_. Lyonet, who congratulated\r\nhimself with having finished his long labours without having had to\r\ndestroy more than eight or nine of the species he wished to describe,\r\nhad the patience to count the different air-tubes in that caterpillar.\r\nHe found that there were 256 longitudinal and 1,336 transverse\r\nbranches; in short, that the body of this creature is traversed in all\r\ndirections by 1,572 aeriferous tubes which are visible to the eye by\r\nthe aid of a magnifying glass, without taking into account those which\r\nmay be imperceptible.\r\n\r\nThe complicated system of the breathing apparatus which we are\r\ndescribing is sometimes composed of an assemblage of tubes and\r\nmembranous pouches, besides the elastic tubes which we have already\r\nmentioned. These pouches vary in size, and are very elastic, expanding\r\nwhen the air enters, and contracting when it leaves them, as they are\r\naltogether without the species of framework formed by the spiral\r\nthread of the tubular tracheæ, of which they are only enlargements.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 is explanatory of these organs of respiration.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory mechanism of an insect is easily understood. \"The\r\nabdominal cavity,\" says M. Milne-Edwards, \"in which is placed the\r\ngreater part of the respiratory apparatus, is susceptible of being\r\ncontracted and dilated alternately by the play of the different\r\nsegments of which the skeleton is composed, and which are placed in\r\nsuch a manner that they can be drawn into each other to a greater or\r\nless extent. When the insect contracts its body, the tracheæ are\r\ncompressed and the air driven out. But when, on the other hand, the\r\nvisceral cavity assumes its normal size, or dilates, these channels\r\nbecome larger, and the air with which they are filled being rarefied\r\nby this expansion, is no longer in equilibrium with the outer air with\r\nwhich it is in communication through the medium of the spiracles. The\r\nexterior air is then impelled into the interior of the respiratory\r\ntubes, and the inspiration is effected.\"\r\n\r\nThe respiratory movements can be accelerated or diminished, according\r\nto the wants of the animal; in general, there are from thirty to fifty\r\nto the minute. In a state of repose the spiracles are open, and all\r\nthe tracheæ are free to receive air whenever the visceral cavity is\r\ndilated, but those orifices may be closed, and the insect thus\r\npossesses the faculty of stopping all communication between the\r\nrespiratory apparatus and the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSome insects live in the water; they are therefore obliged to come to\r\nthe surface to take the air they are in need of, or else to possess\r\nthemselves of the small amount contained in the water. Both these\r\nmethods of respiration exist under different forms in aquatic insects.\r\n\r\nTo inhale atmospheric air, which is necessary for respiration, above\r\nthe water, certain insects employ their elytra[2] as a sort of\r\nreservoir; others make use of their antennæ, the hairs of which retain\r\nthe globules of air. In this case it is brought under the thorax,\r\nwhence a groove carries it to the spiracles. Sometimes the same result\r\nis obtained by a more complicated arrangement, consisting of\r\nrespiratory tubes which can be thrust into the air, which it is their\r\nfunction to introduce into the organisation.\r\n\r\n    [2] The horny upper wings with which some insects are provided\r\n    are called elytra.--ED.\r\n\r\nInsects which breathe in the water without rising to the surface are\r\nprovided with gills--organs which, though variable in form, generally\r\nconsist of foliaceous or fringed expansions, in the midst of which the\r\ntracheæ ramify in considerable numbers. These vessels are filled with\r\nair, but it does not disseminate itself in them directly, and it is\r\nonly through the walls of these tubes that the contained gas is\r\nexchanged for the air held in suspension by the surrounding water. The\r\noxygen contained in the water passes through certain very permeable\r\nmembranes of the gill, and penetrates the tracheæ, which discharge, in\r\nexchange, carbonic acid, which is the gaseous product of respiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Branchiæ, or gills, of an aquatic larva\r\n(_Ephemera_). A, foliaceous laminæ, or gills.]\r\n\r\nFig. 14 represents the gills or breathing apparatus in an aquatic\r\ninsect. We take as an example _Ephemera_.[3] It may be observed that\r\nthe gills or foliaceous laminæ are placed at the circumference of the\r\nbody, and at its smallest parts.\r\n\r\n    [3] May-fly family.--ED.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that the respiratory apparatus is considerably\r\ndeveloped in insects; it is, therefore, easy to foresee that those\r\nfunctions are most actively employed by them. In fact, if one\r\ncompares the oxygen they imbibe with the heavy organic matter of which\r\ntheir body is composed, the amount is enormous.\r\n\r\nBefore finishing this rapid examination of the body of an insect, we\r\nshall have to say a few words on the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThis system is chiefly composed of a double series of ganglions, or\r\ncollections of nerves, which are united together by longitudinal\r\ncords. The number of these ganglions corresponds with that of the\r\nsegments. Sometimes they are at equal distances, and extend in a chain\r\nfrom one end of the body to the other; at others they are many of them\r\nclose together, so as to form a single mass.\r\n\r\nThe cephalic ganglions are two in number; they have been described by\r\nanatomists under the name of brain. \"This expression,\" says M.\r\nLacordaire, \"would be apt to mislead the reader, as it would induce\r\nhim to suppose the existence of a concentration of faculties to\r\ncontrol the feelings and excite the movements, which is not the\r\ncase.\"[4] The same naturalist observes, \"All the ganglions of the\r\nventral chain are endowed with nearly the same properties, and\r\nrepresent each other uniformly.\"\r\n\r\n    [4] \"Introduction à l'Entomologie,\" tome ii. p. 192. 8vo.\r\n    Paris. 1838.\r\n\r\nThe ganglion situated above the oesophagus gives rise to the optic\r\nnerves, which are the most considerable of all those of the body, and\r\nto the nerves of the antennæ. The ganglion beneath the oesophagus\r\nprovides the nerves of the mandibles, of the jaws, and of the lower\r\nlip. The three pairs of ganglions which follow those placed\r\nimmediately below the oesophagus, belong to the three segments of\r\nthe thorax, and give rise to the nerves of the feet and wings. They\r\nare in general more voluminous than the following pairs, which occupy\r\nthe abdomen.\r\n\r\nFig. 15 represents the nervous system of the _Carabus auratus_: A is\r\nthe cephalic ganglion; B, the sub-oesophagian ganglion; C, the\r\nprothoracic ganglion; D and E are the ganglions of the mesothorax and\r\nmetathorax. The remainder, F F, are the abdominal ganglions.\r\n\r\nBefore finishing these preliminary observations, it is necessary to\r\nsay that the preceding remarks only apply absolutely to insects\r\narrived at the perfect state. It is important to make this remark, as\r\ninsects, before arriving at that state, pass through various other\r\nstages. These stages are often so different from each other, that it\r\nwould be difficult to imagine that they are only modifications of the\r\nsame animal; one would suppose that they were as many different kinds\r\nof animals, if there was not abundant proof of the contrary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Nervous system of Carabus auratus.]\r\n\r\nThe successive stages through which an insect passes are four in\r\nnumber:--the egg; the larva; the pupa, nymph, or chrysalis; and the\r\nperfect insect, or imago.\r\n\r\nThe egg state, which is common to them, as to all other articulate\r\nanimals, it is unnecessary to explain. Nearly all insects lay eggs,\r\nthough some few are viviparous. There often exists in the extremity of\r\nthe abdomen of the female a peculiar organ, called the ovipositor,\r\nwhich is destined to make holes for the reception of the eggs. By a\r\nwonderful instinct the mother always lays her eggs in a place where\r\nher young, on being hatched, can find an abundance of nutritious\r\nsubstances. It will not be needless to observe that in most cases,\r\nthese aliments are quite different to those which the mother seeks for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage, that is to say, on leaving the egg--the larva\r\nperiod--the insect presents itself in a soft state, without wings, and\r\nresembles a worm. In ordinary language, it is nearly always called a\r\nworm, or grub, and in certain cases, a caterpillar.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was the first to use the term \"larva\"--taken from the Latin\r\nword _larva_, \"a mask\"--as he considered that, in this form, the\r\ninsect was as it were masked. During this period of its life the\r\ninsect eats voraciously, and often changes its skin. At a certain\r\nperiod it ceases to eat, retires to some hidden spot, and, after\r\nchanging its skin for the last time, enters the third stage of its\r\nexistence, and becomes a chrysalis. In this state it resembles a mummy\r\nenveloped in bandages, or a child in its swaddling clothes. It is\r\ngenerally incapable of either moving or nourishing itself. It\r\ncontinues so for days, weeks, months, and sometimes even for years.\r\n\r\nWhile the insect is thus apparently dead, a slow but certain change is\r\ngoing on in the interior of its body. A marvellous work, though not\r\nvisible outside, is being effected, for the different organs of the\r\ninsect are developing by degrees under the covering which surrounds\r\nthem. When their formation is complete, the insect disengages itself\r\nfrom the narrow prison in which it was enclosed, and makes its\r\nappearance, provided with wings, and capable of propagating its kind;\r\nin short, of enjoying all the faculties which Nature has accorded to\r\nits species. It has thrown off the mask; the larva and pupa has\r\ndisappeared, and given place to the perfect insect.\r\n\r\nTo show the reader the four states through which the insect passes in\r\nsuccession, in Fig. 16 is represented the insect known as the\r\n_Hydrophilus_,[5] firstly, in the egg state; secondly, as the larva,\r\nor caterpillar; thirdly in the pupa; and fourthly as the perfect\r\ninsect or imago. The different degrees of transformation and evolution\r\nwhich we have just described, are those which take place either\r\ncompletely or incompletely in all insects. Their metamorphoses are\r\nthen at an end. There are certain insects, however, that show no\r\ndifference in their various stages, except by absence of wings in\r\nthe larva; and in these the chrysalis is only characterised by the\r\ngrowth of the wings, which, at first folded back and hidden under\r\nthe skin, afterwards become free, but are not wholly developed till\r\nthe last skin is cast. These insects are said to undergo incomplete\r\nmetamorphoses, the former complete metamorphoses. Some never possess\r\nwings; indeed, there are others which undergo no metamorphosis, and\r\nare born possessed of all the organs with which it is necessary they\r\nshould be provided.\r\n\r\n    [5] A kind of water-beetle.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Hydrophilus in its four states. A, eggs; B,\r\nlarva; C, pupa; D, imago, or perfect insect.]\r\n\r\nSome curious researches have been lately made on the strength\r\nof insects. M. Felix Plateau, of Brussels, has published some\r\nobservations on this point, which we think of sufficient interest to\r\nreproduce here.\r\n\r\nIn order to measure the muscular strength of man, or of animals--as\r\nthe horse, for instance--many different dynamometric apparatuses have\r\nbeen invented, composed of springs, or systems of unequal levers. The\r\nTurks' heads which are seen at fairs, or in the Champs Élysées, at\r\nParis, and on which the person who wishes to try his strength gives a\r\nstrong blow with his fist, represent a dynamometer of this kind. The\r\none which Buffon had constructed by Régnier the mechanician, and which\r\nis known by the name of Régnier's Dynamometer, is much more precise.\r\nIt consists of an oval spring, of which the two ends approach each\r\nother; when they are pulled in opposite directions, a needle, which\r\nworks on a dial marked with figures, indicates the force exercised on\r\nthe spring. It has been proved, with this instrument, that the\r\nmuscular effort of a man pulling with both hands is about 124 lbs.,\r\nand that of a woman only 74 lbs. The ordinary effort of strength of a\r\nman in lifting a weight is 292 lbs.; and a horse, in pulling, shows a\r\nstrength of 675 lbs.; a man, under the same circumstances, exhibiting\r\na strength of 90 lbs.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists have not as yet given their attention to the strength of\r\ninvertebrate animals. It is, relatively speaking, immense. Many people\r\nhave observed how out of proportion a jump of a flea is to its size. A\r\nflea is not more than an eighth of an inch in length, and it jumps a\r\nyard; in proportion, a lion ought to jump two-thirds of a mile. Pliny\r\nshows, in his \"Natural History,\" that the weights carried by ants\r\nappear exceedingly great when they are compared with the size of these\r\nindefatigable labourers. The strength of these insects is still more\r\nstriking, when one considers the edifices they are able to construct,\r\nand the devastations they occasion. The _Termes_, or White Ant,[6]\r\nconstructs habitations many yards in height, which are so firmly and\r\nsolidly built, that the buffaloes are able to mount them, and use them\r\nas observatories; they are made of particles of wood joined together\r\nby a gummy substance, and are able to resist even the force of a\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\n    [6] A neuropterous insect, not a true ant.--ED.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which is worth being noted. Man is proud\r\nof his works; but what are they, after all, in comparison with those\r\nof the ant, taking the relative heights into consideration? The\r\nlargest pyramid in Egypt is only 146 yards high, that is, about ninety\r\ntimes the average height of man; whereas, the nests of the Termites\r\nare a thousand times the height of the insects which construct them.\r\nTheir habitations are thus twelve times higher than the largest\r\nspecimen of architecture raised by human hands. We are, therefore,\r\nfar beneath these little insects, as far as strength and the spirit\r\nof working go.\r\n\r\nThe destructive power of these creatures, so insignificant in\r\nappearance, are still more surprising. During the spring of a single\r\nyear they can effect the ruin of a house by destroying the beams and\r\nplanks. The town of La Rochelle, to which the Termites were imported\r\nby an American ship, is menaced with being eventually suspended on\r\ncatacombs, like the town of Valencia in New Grenada. It is well known\r\nwhat destruction is caused when a swarm of locusts alight in a\r\ncultivated field; and it is certain that even their larvæ do as severe\r\ninjury as the perfect insect. All this sufficiently proves the\r\ndestructive capabilities of these little animals, which we are\r\naccustomed to despise.\r\n\r\nM. Plateau has studied the power of traction in some insects, the\r\npower of pushing in the digging insects, and the lifting power of\r\nothers during flight. He has thus been able to make some most\r\ninteresting comparisons, of some of which we will relate the results.\r\n\r\nThe average weight of man being 142 lbs., and his power of traction,\r\naccording to Régnier, being 124 lbs., the proportion of the weight he\r\ncan draw to the weight of his body is only as 87 to 100. With the\r\nhorse the proportion is not more than 67 to 100, a horse 1,350 lbs. in\r\nweight only drawing about 900 lbs. The horse, therefore, can draw\r\nlittle more than half his own weight, and a man cannot draw the weight\r\nof his own body.\r\n\r\nThis is a very poor result, if compared with the strength of the\r\ncockchafer. This insect, in fact, possesses a power of traction equal\r\nto more than fourteen times its own weight. If you amuse yourself with\r\nthe children's game of making a cockchafer draw small cargoes of\r\nstones, you will be surprised at the great weight which this\r\ninsignificant looking animal is able to manage.\r\n\r\nTo test the power of traction in insects, M. Plateau attached them to\r\na weight by means of a thread fastened to one of their feet. The\r\n_Coleoptera_ (Beetles) are the best adapted for these experiments.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the results obtained by the Belgian\r\nphysician:--_Carabus auratus_ can draw seven times the weight of its\r\nbody; _Nebria brevicollis_, twenty-five times; _Necrophorus vespillo_,\r\nfifteen times; _Trichius fasciatus_, forty-one times; and _Oryctes\r\nnasicornis_, four times only. The bee can draw twenty times the weight\r\nof its body; _Donacia nymphæ_[7] forty-two times its own weight.\r\n\r\n    [7] A beetle.--ED.\r\n\r\nFrom this it follows that if the horse possessed the same strength as\r\nthis last insect, or if the insect were the size of a horse, they\r\nwould either of them be able to draw 155,250 lbs. M. Plateau has\r\nascertained the pushing power in insects, by introducing them into a\r\npasteboard tube, the interior of which was made rough, and in which\r\nwas fixed a glass plate, which allowed the light to penetrate into the\r\nprison. The animal, if excited, struggled with all its strength\r\nagainst the transparent plate, which, on being pushed forward, turned\r\na lever adapted to a miniature dynamometer, which indicated the amount\r\nof effort exercised.\r\n\r\nThe results thus obtained prove that the pushing power, like the power\r\nof traction, is greater in inverse proportion to the size and weight\r\nof the animal. A few figures will better explain this curious law. In\r\n_Oryctes nasicornis_ the proportion of the pushing power to the weight\r\nof the insect is only three to two; in _Geotrupes stercorarius_ it is\r\nsixteen to two; and in _Onthophagus nuchicornis_ seventy-nine to six.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made on the lifting power of insects by\r\nfastening a ball of soft wax to a thread attached to the hind legs.\r\nThe proportion of the weight lifted has been found equal to that of\r\nthe body. That is to say, that the insect, when flying, can lift its\r\nown weight. This is proved by the following calculations:--In the\r\nNeuroptera the proportion is 1 in the Dragon-fly (_Libellula\r\nvulgata_), ·7 in _Lestes sponsa_. In the order Hymenoptera it is ·78\r\nin the bee, and ·63 in _Bombus terrestris_, the humble-bee. In the\r\nDiptera it is ·9 in _Calliphora vomitoria_,[8] 1·84 in the _Syrphus\r\ncorollæ_, and 1·77 in the house-fly.\r\n\r\n    [8] The meat-fly.--ED.\r\n\r\nThese results show that insects have only sufficient power to sustain\r\ntheir own weight when flying, as the above calculations exhibit the\r\nmaximum of which they are capable, and at the utmost this strength\r\nwould only compensate for the fatigue occasioned by the action of\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is to be observed that the Diptera, and among\r\nothers the house-fly, can sustain their flight longer than the\r\nHymenoptera and Neuroptera, although one would not think so from their\r\nappearance. In conclusion, if an insect's power of flying is not\r\nconsiderable, its power of traction and propulsion are immense,\r\ncompared with the vertebrate animals; and, in the same group of\r\ninsects, those that are the smallest and lightest are the strongest.\r\nThe proportion between the muscular strength of insects and the\r\ndimensions of their bodies, would not appear to be on account of\r\ntheir muscles being more numerous than those of vertebrate animals,\r\nbut on account of greater intrinsic energy and muscular activity. The\r\narticulations of insects may be considered as solid cases which\r\nenvelop the muscles, and the thickness of these cases appears to\r\ndecrease in a singular manner according to the size of the creature.\r\nThe relative bulk of the muscles being less in the smaller species\r\nthan in the larger, it is necessary to explain the superior relative\r\nstrength of the former by supposing them to possess a greater amount\r\nof vital energy.\r\n\r\nThese astonishing phenomena will perhaps be better understood if we\r\nconsider the obstacles which insects have to overcome to satisfy their\r\nwants, to seek their food, to defend themselves against their enemies,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nTo meet these requirements they are marvellously constructed for both\r\nlabour and warfare, and their strength is superior to that displayed\r\nby all other animals. It is also much greater than that of the\r\nmachines we construct to replace manual labour. They represent\r\nstrength itself. God's workmen are infinitely more powerful than those\r\ninvented by the genius of man, which we call machines.\r\n\r\nWe think it necessary, in closing this chapter, to give a sort of\r\ngeneral outline of the great class of animals which we are about to\r\nstudy. If we wished to characterise insects by their exterior aspect,\r\nwe might consider them as articulate animals, whose bodies, covered\r\nwith tough and membranous integuments, are divided into three distinct\r\nparts: the head, provided with two antennæ, and eyes and mouth of very\r\nvariable form; a trunk or thorax, composed of three segments, which\r\nhas underneath it always six articulated limbs, and often above it two\r\nor four wings; and an abdomen, composed of nine segments, although\r\nsome may not appear to exist at first sight.\r\n\r\nIf, in addition to these characteristics, one considers that these\r\nanimals are not provided with interior skeletons--that their nervous\r\nsystem is formed of a double cord, swelling at intervals, and placed\r\nalong the under-side of the body, with the exception of the first\r\nswellings or ganglions which are under the head--that they are not\r\nprovided with a complete circulating system--that they breathe by\r\nparticular organs, termed tracheæ, extending parallel to each other\r\nalong each side of the body, and communicating with the exterior\r\nair by lateral openings termed spiracles--that their sexes are\r\ndistinct--that they are reproduced from eggs--and, in conclusion,\r\nthat the different parts we have mentioned are not complete until\r\nthe creature has passed through several successive changes, called\r\nmetamorphoses, a general idea may be formed of what is meant in\r\nzoology by the word \"insect.\"\r\n\r\nInsects, whose general organisation we have briefly traced, have been\r\nclassed by naturalists as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. APTERA (Fleas and Lice).\r\n  2. DIPTERA (Gnats, Flies, &c.)\r\n  3. HEMIPTERA (Bugs, &c.)\r\n  4. LEPIDOPTERA (Butterflies and Moths).\r\n  5. ORTHOPTERA (Grasshoppers, Crickets, Cockroaches, &c.)\r\n  6. HYMENOPTERA (Bees, Wasps, &c.)\r\n  7. THYSANOPTERA (_Thrips cerealium_).\r\n  8. NEUROPTERA (_Libellula_, or Dragon-fly; _Ephemera_,\r\n       or May-fly; _Phryganea_, or Alder-fly).\r\n  9. COLEOPTERA (Beetles).\r\n\r\nWe shall commence the history of the various orders by examining the\r\nAptera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsects of this order are without wings, and the name is derived from\r\ntwo Greek words, [Greek: a], privative, and [Greek: pteron], wing,\r\nindicating the negative character which constitutes this order.[9] It\r\nconsists of Fleas and Lice. The Flea (_Pulex_), of which De Geer\r\nformed a separate group, and called _Suctoria_, includes several\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n    [9] It is probable that one day the order Aptera will be\r\n    superseded. The absence of wings is not really a character of\r\n    great value. De Blainville, Mollard, Pouchet, Van Beneden, and\r\n    Gervais, have made several attempts in that direction. The\r\n    fleas have been placed among the Diptera, and the lice among\r\n    Hemiptera in the \"Traité de Zoologie Médicale\" of these two\r\n    last authors.\r\n\r\nThe common flea (_Pulex irritans_, Fig. 17) has a body of oval form,\r\nsomewhat flattened, covered with a rather hard horny skin of a\r\nbrilliant chestnut brown colour. It is the breaking of this hard skin\r\nwhich produces the little crack which is heard when, after a\r\nsuccessful hunt, one has the happiness to crush one of these parasites\r\nbetween one's nails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Flea (_Pulex irritans_).]\r\n\r\nIts head, small in proportion to the body, is compressed, and carries\r\ntwo small antennæ, of cylindrical form, composed of four joints, which\r\nthe animal shakes continually when in motion, but which it lowers and\r\nrests in front of its head when in a state of repose. The eyes are\r\nsimple, large, and round. The beak is composed of an exterior jointed\r\nsheath, having inside it a tube, and carrying underneath two long\r\nsharp lancets, with cutting and saw-like edges. It is with this\r\ninstrument that the flea pierces the skin, irritates it, and causes\r\nthe blood on which it lives to flow.\r\n\r\nThis bite, as every one knows, is easily recognised by the presence of\r\nsmall darkish red spots, surrounded by a circle of a paler colour.\r\nThe quantity of blood absorbed by this little creature is enormous,\r\nwhen compared with its size.\r\n\r\nThe body of the flea is divided into thirteen segments, of which one\r\nforms the head; three the thorax, which is short, and the remainder\r\nthe abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe limbs are long, strong, and spiny. The tarsus, or foot, has five\r\njoints, and terminates in hooks turned in opposite directions. The two\r\nanterior limbs are separated from the others, and are inserted nearly\r\nunder the head; the posterior ones are particularly large and strong.\r\n\r\nThe jumps which fleas are able to make are really gigantic, and the\r\nstrength of these little animals quite herculean, when compared with\r\nthe size of their bodies. The reader may be inclined to smile at the\r\nassertion that the flea possesses herculean strength; but let him wait\r\na little, and he will find that it is no exaggeration.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the strength, the docility, and the goodwill of\r\nthe fleas, some wonderful little things have been made, which have\r\nserved at the same time to show the astonishing skill of certain\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Histoire abrégée des Insectes,\" published in the seventh year\r\nof the French Republic, Geoffroy relates that a certain Mark, an\r\nEnglishman, had succeeded, by dint of patience and art, in making a\r\ngold chain the length of a finger, with a padlock and a key to fasten\r\nit, not exceeding a single grain in weight. A flea attached to the\r\nchain pulled it easily. The same learned writer relates a still more\r\nsurprising fact. An English workman constructed a carriage and six\r\nhorses of ivory. The coachman was on the box, with a dog between his\r\nlegs, there were also a postillion, four persons in the carriage, and\r\ntwo servants behind, and the whole of this was drawn by one flea.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Histoire Naturelle des Insectes Aptères,\" Baron Walckenaer\r\nrelates the following marvellous instance of industry, patience, and\r\ndexterity:--\r\n\r\n\"I think it is about fifteen years ago, that the whole population of\r\nParis could see the following wonders exhibited on the Place de la\r\nBourse for sixty centimes. They were the learned fleas. I have seen\r\nand examined them with entomological eyes, assisted by a glass.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty fleas went through military exercise, and stood upon their\r\nhind legs, armed with pikes, formed of very small splinters of wood.\r\n\r\n\"Two fleas were harnessed to and drew a golden carriage with four\r\nwheels and a postillion. A third flea was seated on the coach-box, and\r\nheld a splinter of wood for a whip. Two other fleas drew a cannon on\r\nits carriage; this little trinket was admirably finished, not a screw\r\nor a nut was wanting. These and other wonders were performed on\r\npolished glass. The flea-horses were fastened by a gold chain attached\r\nto the thighs of their hind legs, which I was told was never taken\r\noff. They had lived thus for two years and a half, not one having died\r\nduring the period. To be fed, they were placed on a man's arm, which\r\nthey sucked. When they were unwilling to draw the cannon or the\r\ncarriage, the man took a burning coal, and on it being moved about\r\nnear them, they were at once roused, and recommenced the\r\nperformances.\"\r\n\r\nThe learned fleas were the admiration and amazement of Paris, Lyons,\r\nand the chief provincial towns of France, in 1825.\r\n\r\nBut how, one will ask, was it possible in a large public room to see\r\nthis wonderful sight? And it is necessary that this should be\r\nexplained. The spectators were seated in front of a curtain, provided\r\nwith magnifying glasses, through which they looked, as they would at a\r\ndiorama of landscapes or buildings.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the natural history of our insect. The female\r\nflea lays from eight to twelve eggs, which are of oval shape, smooth,\r\nviscous, and white.\r\n\r\nContrary to what one might think, _à priori_, the flea does not fix\r\nits eggs to the skin of its victims. She lets them drop on the ground,\r\nbetween the boards of floors, or old furniture, and among dirty linen\r\nand rubbish.\r\n\r\nM. Defrance has remarked that there are always found mixed with the\r\neggs a certain number of grains of a brilliant black colour, which are\r\nsimply dried blood. This is a provision which the foreseeing mother\r\nhas prepared at our expense to nourish her young offspring.\r\n\r\nIn four or five days in summer, and in eleven days in winter, one may\r\nsee coming out of these eggs small, elongated larvæ, of cylindrical\r\nform, covered with hair, and divided into three parts, the last\r\nprovided with two small hooks. The head is scaly above, has two small\r\nantennæ, and is without eyes. These larvæ are without limbs, but they\r\ncan twist about, roll themselves over and over, and even advance\r\npretty fast by raising their heads. Though at first white, they become\r\nafterwards of a reddish colour.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after they are hatched they cease to eat, and are\r\nimmovable, as if about to die. They then commence to make a small,\r\nwhitish, silky cocoon, in which they are transformed into pupæ. In\r\nanother fortnight these pupæ become perfect insects.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable trait, and unique among insects, has been observed\r\nin the flea. The mother disgorges into the mouths of the larvæ the\r\nblood with which she is filled.\r\n\r\nThe flea is most abundant in Europe and the North of Africa. Certain\r\ncircumstances particularly favour its multiplication; being most\r\nabundant in dirty houses, in barracks, and in camps; in deserted\r\nbuildings, in ruins, and in places frequented by people of uncleanly\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of fleas live on animals, as, for example, the cat flea,\r\nthe dog flea, and those of the pigeon and poultry.\r\n\r\nWe shall say a few words about a peculiar species which abounds in all\r\nthe hot parts of America, but principally in the Brazils and the\r\nneighbouring countries. This formidable species is the Chigo (_Pulex\r\npenetrans_).\r\n\r\nThe chigo, called also the tick, is smaller than the common flea. It\r\nis flat, brown with a white spot on the back, and is armed with a\r\nstrong pointed stiff beak, provided with three lancets. It is with\r\nthis instrument that the female attacks man with the intention of\r\nlodging in his skin and bringing forth her young there.\r\n\r\nThe chigo attacks chiefly the feet. It slips in between the flesh and\r\nthe nails, or gets under the skin of the heel. Notwithstanding the\r\nlength of the animal's beak, introducing itself beneath the skin does\r\nnot at first cause any pain; but after a few days one is made aware of\r\nits presence by an itching, which, though at first slight, gradually\r\nincreases, and ends by becoming unbearable.\r\n\r\nThe chigo, when under the skin, betrays itself by a bump outside. Its\r\nbody has now become as large as a pea; in the attacked skin a large\r\nbrown bag containing matter is formed. In this bag are collected the\r\neggs, which issue from an orifice in the posterior extremity, and are\r\nnot hatched in the wound itself, as was long thought to be the case.\r\n\r\nThe chigoes are an object of terror to the Brazilian negroes. These\r\nformidable parasites sometimes attack the whole of the foot, which\r\nthey devour, and thus bring on mortification; many negroes losing the\r\nbones of some of their toes by the ravages of these dangerous\r\ncreatures. To guard against their attacks, they wear thick shoes, and\r\nexamine their feet carefully every day. The plan usually followed in\r\nthe Brazils to prevent the chigoes from injuring the feet, is to\r\nemploy children, who, by their sharpness of sight, can easily perceive\r\nthe red spot on the skin where the chigo has entered. These children\r\nare in the habit of extracting the insect from the wound by means of a\r\nneedle. But this is not without risk; as, if any portion of the insect\r\nremains in the wound, a dangerous inflammation may ensue. For this\r\nreason, operators who are renowned for their skill are much sought\r\nafter, flattered, and rewarded by the poor negroes of the plantations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Louse (_Pediculus capitis_) magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe Head Louse (_Pediculus capitis_, Fig. 18) is an insect with a flat\r\nbody, slightly transparent, and of greyish colour, spotted with black\r\non the spiracles, soft in the middle, and rather hard at the sides.\r\nThe head, which is oval, is furnished with two thread-like antennæ,\r\ncomposed of five joints, which are constantly in motion while the\r\ncreature is walking; it is also furnished with two simple, round,\r\nblack eyes; and lastly, with a mouth. In the front of the head is a\r\nshort, conical, fleshy nipple. This nipple contains a sucker, or\r\nrostrum, which the animal can put out when it likes, and which, when\r\nextended, represents a tubular body, terminating in six little pointed\r\nhooks, bent back, and serving to retain the instrument in the skin.\r\nThis organ is surmounted by four fine hairs, fixed to one another, and\r\nseated in its interior. It is by means of this complicated apparatus\r\nthat the louse pricks and sucks the skin of the head. The thorax is\r\nnearly square, and divided into three parts by deep incisions. The\r\nabdomen, strongly lobed at the sides, is composed of eight rings, and\r\nis provided with sixteen spiracles. The limbs consist of a trochanter,\r\na thigh, a shank, and a tarsus of a single joint, and are very thick.\r\nA strong nail, which folds back on an indented projection, thus\r\nforming a pincer, terminates the tarsus. It is with this pincer that\r\nthe louse fastens itself to the hair.\r\n\r\nLice are oviparous. Their eggs, which remain sticking to the hair, are\r\nlong and white, and are commonly called \"nits.\" The young are hatched\r\nin the course of five or six days; and in eighteen days are able to\r\nreproduce their kind. Leuwenhoek calculated that in two months two\r\nfemale lice could produce ten thousand! Other naturalists have\r\nasserted that the second generation of a single individual can amount\r\nto two thousand five hundred, and the third, to a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand! Happily for the victims of these disgusting\r\nparasites, their reproduction is not generally to this prodigious\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nMany means are employed to kill lice. Lotions of the smaller centaury\r\nor of stavesacre, and pomatum mixed with mercurial ointment, are very\r\nefficacious. But the surest and easiest remedy is to put plenty of oil\r\non the head. The oil kills the lice by obstructing their tracheæ, and\r\nthus stopping respiration.\r\n\r\nThere are other kinds of lice, but we will only mention the louse\r\nwhich infests beggars and people of unclean habits, _Pediculus humanus\r\ncorporis_, producing the complaint called phthiriasis. In the victims\r\nof this disease these parasites increase with fearful rapidity. This\r\ndreadful disorder is often mentioned by the ancients. King Antiochus,\r\nthe philosopher Pherecydes of Scyros, the contemporary and friend of\r\nThales, the dictator Sylla, Agrippa, and Valerius Maximus, are said to\r\nhave been attacked by phthiriasis, and even to have died of it. Amatus\r\nLusitanus, a Portuguese doctor of the sixteenth century, relates that\r\nlice increased so quickly and to such an extent on a rich nobleman\r\nattacked with phthiriasis, that the whole duty of two of his servants\r\nconsisted in carrying away, and throwing into the sea, whole\r\nbasketfuls of the vermin, which were continually escaping from the\r\nperson of their noble master.\r\n\r\nLittle is known at the present day of the details of this complaint,\r\nthough it is observed frequently enough in some parts of the south of\r\nEurope, where the dirty and miserable inhabitants are a prey to\r\npoverty and uncleanliness--two misfortunes which often go together. In\r\nGallicia, in Poland, in the Asturias, and in Spain, we may find many\r\nvictims of phthiriasis.\r\n\r\nLice increase with such rapidity on persons thus attacked, that it is\r\ncommon to attribute their appearance to spontaneous generation alone.\r\nBut the prodigious rapidity of reproduction in these insects\r\nsufficiently explains their increase, especially when it is admitted\r\nthat it is possible for the female louse to reproduce young without\r\nthe agency of the male.\r\n\r\nThe Thysanura or \"Skip Tail\" tribe are small insects, which are better\r\nknown on account of the beauty of their microscopic body scales than\r\nfor any interesting habits or instincts. They do not undergo\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe Fish Scale or _Lepisma saccharina_, and the Skip Tail or _Podura\r\nplumbea_ belong to the Thysanura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nDIPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll suctorial insects which in the perfect state possess only two\r\nmembranous wings, are called Diptera, from two Greek words--[Greek:\r\ndis], twice, and [Greek: pteron], wing.\r\n\r\nThe Diptera were known and scientifically described at a very early\r\ndate. They are frequently mentioned by Aristotle in his \"History of\r\nAnimals;\" and he applied the term to the same insects as now\r\nconstitute the order.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the second wings, common to other insects, which are in\r\nthis case replaced by two appendages, which have received the name of\r\nbalancers,[10] because they serve to regulate the action of flight,\r\nconstitutes the chief characteristic of the Diptera. Let us, however,\r\ngive a glance at their other organs, which have more or less affinity\r\nwith those which exist in other classes of insects, preserving,\r\nnevertheless, their own especial characteristics.\r\n\r\n    [10] Sometimes called _halteres_.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe mouth, for instance--suited for suction only--is in the form of a\r\ntrunk, and is composed of a sheath, a sucker, and two palpi. The\r\nantennæ are generally composed of only three joints. The eyes--usually\r\ntwo in number--are very large, and sometimes take up nearly the whole\r\nof the head. They are both simple and compound. The wings are\r\nmembranous, delicate, and veined; the limbs long and slight. In giving\r\nthe history of the principal types of Diptera, we shall explain more\r\nfully the formation of these organs.\r\n\r\nThe Diptera, by their rapid flight, enliven both the earth and the\r\nair. The different species abound in every climate, and in every\r\nsituation, some inhabiting woods, plains, fields, or banks of rivers;\r\nothers preferring our houses. They like the neighbourhood of\r\nvegetation, choosing either the flowers, the leaves, or the stems of\r\nthe trees of our woods, our gardens, or our plantations. Their food\r\nvaries very much; and the formation of the sucker is regulated by it.\r\nSome imbibe blood, others live on the secretions of animals. Their\r\nchief nourishment, however, consists of the juices of flowers, on\r\nwhose brilliant corollas the Diptera abound, either plundering from\r\nevery species indiscriminately, or attaching themselves to some\r\nparticular kind. They display the most wonderful instinct in their\r\nmaternal care, and employ the most varied and ingenious precautions to\r\npreserve their progeny.\r\n\r\nThe Diptera, besides their variety and the number of their species,\r\nare remarkable on account of their profusion. The myriads of flies\r\nwhich rise from our meadows, which fly in crowds around our plants,\r\nand around every organised substance from which life has departed,\r\nsome of which even infest living animals, are Diptera.\r\n\r\nThe profusion with which they are distributed over the face of the\r\nglobe, causes them to fulfil two important duties in the economy of\r\nNature. On the one hand, they furnish to insectivorous birds an\r\ninexhaustible supply of food; on the other, they contribute to the\r\nremoval of all decaying animal and vegetable substances, and thus\r\nserve to purify the air which we breathe. Their fecundity, the\r\nrapidity with which one generation succeeds another, and their great\r\nvoracity, added to the extraordinary quickness of their reproduction,\r\nare such that Linnæus tells us that three flies, with the generations\r\nwhich spring from them, could eat up a dead horse as quickly as a lion\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThese Diptera, which are worthy of so much attention, and deserve so\r\nmuch study with regard to the part they play in the general economy of\r\nNature, are an object of fear and repulsion when one considers their\r\nrelations to us and other animals. Gnats and mosquitoes suck our\r\nblood; the gad-fly and the species of Asilus attack our cattle. The\r\norder Diptera is composed of a great number of families, which are\r\nagain divided into tribes, each comprising several genera. We shall\r\nonly notice the more remarkable genera of Diptera.\r\n\r\nM. Macquart, the learned author of \"L'Histoire Naturelle des\r\nDiptères,\"[11] divides this great class of insects into two principal\r\ngroups. In one of these groups, the antennæ are formed of at least six\r\njoints, and the palpi of four or five: these are called Nemocera. In\r\nthe other, the antennæ consists only of three joints, and the palpi of\r\none or two: these are the Brachycera.\r\n\r\n    [11] \"Suites à Buffon.\" 2 vols. 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe Nemocera may generally be distinguished from the other Diptera,\r\nindependently of the difference in the antennæ and palpi, by the\r\nslenderness of the body, the smallness of the head, the shape of the\r\nthorax, and the length of the feet and wings. The result of this\r\norganisation is a graceful, light, and aerial form.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEMOCERA.\r\n\r\nAbounding everywhere, the Nemocera live, some on the blood of man and\r\nanimals, some on small insects, and others on the juices of fragrant\r\nflowers. From [Greek: nêma], thread; [Greek: keras], horn.\r\n\r\nIn all climates, in every latitude, in the fields and woods, even in\r\nour dwellings, they may be seen fluttering and plundering. The\r\nNemocera are divided into two families, that of the _Culicidæ_, of\r\nwhich the gnat (_Culex_), which has a long, thin trunk, and a sucker\r\nprovided with six bristles, is a member; and that of the _Tipulidæ_,\r\nwhich have a short thick trunk, and a sucker having two bristles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 19 and 20.--The Gnat (_Culex pipiens_).]\r\n\r\nWe will begin our examination with the Gnat (_Culex pipiens_), of\r\nwhich Réaumur, in his \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des\r\nInsectes,\" has given such a curious and complete history. \"The gnat is\r\nour declared enemy,\" says Réaumur, in the introduction to his memoir,\r\n\"and a very troublesome enemy it is. However, it is well to make its\r\nacquaintance, for if we pay a little attention we shall be forced to\r\nadmire it, and even to admire the instrument with which it wounds us.\r\nBesides which, throughout the whole course of its life it offers most\r\ninteresting matter of investigation to those who are curious to know\r\nthe wonders of Nature. During a period in its life the observer,\r\nforgetting that it will at some time annoy him, feels the greatest\r\ninterest in its life-history.\"\r\n\r\nAs this is the case, let us explain the history of these insects,\r\nwhich excite so much interest. The illustrious naturalist we have just\r\nmentioned will be our guide.\r\n\r\nThe body of the gnat is long and cylindrical. When in a state of\r\nrepose one of its wings is crossed over the other. They present a\r\ncharming appearance when seen through a microscope, their nervures, as\r\nwell as their edges, being completely covered with scales, shaped like\r\noblong plates and finely striated longitudinally. These scales are\r\nalso found on all the segments of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Antennæ of Gnat, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Head of Gnat, magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe antennæ of the gnat, particularly those of the male, have a fine\r\nfeathery appearance (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\nTheir eyes, covered with network, are so large that they cover nearly\r\nthe whole of the head. Some have eyes of a brilliant green colour, but\r\nlooked at in certain lights they appear red. Fig. 22 shows the head of\r\nthe gnat with its two eyes, its antennæ, and trunk.\r\n\r\nThe instrument which the gnat employs for puncturing the skin, and\r\nwhich is called the trunk (Fig. 23), is well worthy of our attention.\r\nThat which is generally seen is only the case of those instruments\r\nwhich are intended to pierce our skin and suck our blood, and in which\r\nthey are held, as lancets and other instruments are held in a\r\nsurgeon's case. The case (Fig. 24) is cylindrical, covered with\r\nscales, and terminates in a small knob. Split from end to end that it\r\nmay open, it contains a perfect bundle of stings. Réaumur tried to\r\nobserve, by allowing himself to be stung by gnats, what took place\r\nduring the attack. He forgot, in watching the operations of the\r\ninsect, the slight pain caused by the wound, soliciting it as a\r\nfavour, his only regret being not to obtain it when he wished.\r\n\r\nRéaumur observed that the compound sting, which is about a line in\r\nlength, enters the skin to the depth of about three-quarters of a\r\nline, and that during that time the case bends into a bow, until the\r\ntwo ends meet. He noticed besides, that the trunk-case of certain\r\ngnats was even more complicated than that which we have described. But\r\nwe will not dwell any longer on this point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 23 and 24.--Trunk of Gnat, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 25, 26, 27.--Lancets of the Gnat.]\r\n\r\nLet us now try to give an idea of the construction and composition of\r\nthis sting, which, after piercing the skin, draws our blood.\r\n\r\nAccording to Réaumur, the sting of the gnat is composed of five parts.\r\nHe acknowledges, however, that it is very difficult to be certain of\r\nthe exact number of these parts, on account of the way in which they\r\nare united, and of their form. At the present day we know that there\r\nare six. Réaumur, as also Leuwenhoek, thought he saw two in the form\r\nof a sword blade with three edges. These have the points reversed, and\r\nare serrated on the convex side of the bend (Fig. 25). To form an idea\r\nof the shape of the other points, the reader should look at Figs. 26\r\nand 27. He will then see that the gnat's sting is a sword in\r\nminiature.\r\n\r\nThe prick made by so fine a point as that of the sting of the gnat\r\nought not to cause any pain. \"The point of the finest needle,\" says\r\nRéaumur, \"compared to the sting of the gnat, is the same as the point\r\nof a sword compared to that of the needle.\" How is it then that so\r\nsmall a wound does not heal at once? How is it that small bumps arise\r\non the part that is stung? The fact is, that it is not only a wound,\r\nbut it has been imbued with an irritating liquid.\r\n\r\nThis liquid may be seen to exude, under different circumstances, from\r\nthe trunk of the gnat, like a drop of very clear water.\r\n\r\nRéaumur sometimes saw this liquid even in the trunk itself. \"There is\r\nnothing better,\" he observes, \"to prevent the bad effects of gnat\r\nbites than at once to dilute the liquid they have left in the wound\r\nwith water. However small this wound may be, it will not be difficult\r\nfor water to be introduced. By rubbing, it will be at once enlarged,\r\nand there is nothing to do but to wash it. I have sometimes found this\r\nremedy answer very well.\"\r\n\r\nThe gnat is not always in the form of a winged insect, greedy for our\r\nblood. There is a period during which they leave us in repose. This is\r\nthe larva period. It is in water, and in stagnant water in particular,\r\nthat the larva of the insect which occupies our attention is to be\r\nfound. It resembles a worm, and may be found in ponds from the month\r\nof May until the commencement of winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Larva of the Gnat.]\r\n\r\nIf we desire to follow the larva of the gnat from the beginning, we\r\nhave only to keep a bucket of water in the open air. After a few days\r\nthis water will be observed to be full of the larvæ of the gnat (Fig.\r\n28). They are very small, and come to the surface of the water to\r\nbreathe; for which purpose they extend the opening of a pipe, A, which\r\nis attached to the last segment of the body, a little above the\r\nsurface. They are, consequently, obliged to hold their heads down. By\r\nthe side of the breathing-tube is another tube, B, shorter and thicker\r\nthan the former, nearly perpendicular to the body, its orifice being\r\nthe exterior termination of the digestive tube. At the anus it is\r\nfringed with long hairs, having the appearance, when in the water, of\r\na funnel. At the end of the same tube, and inside the hair funnel, are\r\nfour thin, oval, transparent, scaly blades, having the appearance of\r\nfins. They are placed in pairs, of which one emanates from the right\r\nside, the other from the left.\r\n\r\nThese four blades or fins have the power of separating from each\r\nother. Each segment of the abdomen has on both sides a tuft of hair,\r\nand the thorax has three. The head is round and flat, and is provided\r\nwith two simple brown eyes. Round the mouth are several wattles,\r\nfurnished with hair, of which two of crescent-like form are the most\r\nconspicuous. These tufts move with great quickness, causing small\r\ncurrents of liquid to flow into the mouth, by means of which the\r\nnecessary food, microscopic insects and particles of vegetable and\r\nearthy matter, is brought to the larva.\r\n\r\nThey change their skin several times during their continuance in this\r\nstate. This latter fact has been remarked by Dom Allou, a learned\r\nCarthusian, \"whose pleasure,\" says Réaumur, \"consisted in admiring the\r\nworks of the Almighty, when not occupied in singing his praises.\" We\r\nthink it will be interesting to repeat the few lines which accompany\r\nthe mention made by Réaumur of this worthy Carthusian. They appear to\r\nus to be well worth reading, even at the present day.\r\n\r\n\"If the pious monks who composed so many societies, possessed, like\r\nDom Allou, the love of observing insects, we might hope that the most\r\nessential facts in the history of those little creatures would soon be\r\nmade known to us. What enjoyment more worthy of the calling they have\r\nchosen could these pious men pursue than that which would place before\r\ntheir eyes the marvellous creations of an Almighty Power? Even their\r\nleisure would then incline them to adore that Power, and would furnish\r\nthem the means to make others do so who are occupied by too serious or\r\ntoo frivolous employments.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having changed its skin three times in a fortnight or three\r\nweeks, the larva of the gnat throws off its covering for a fourth\r\ntime, and is no longer in the larva state. It is changed both in shape\r\nand condition. Instead of being oblong, its body is shortened,\r\nrounded, and bent in such a way that the tail is applied to the under\r\npart of the head. This is the case when the animal is in repose; but\r\nit is able to move and swim, and then, by bending its body and\r\nstraightening it again, propels itself through the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Pupa of the Gnat.]\r\n\r\nIn this new condition, that is to say, in the pupa state (Fig. 29), it\r\ndoes not eat. It no longer possesses digestive organs, but it is\r\nnecessary, even more than before its metamorphosis, that it should\r\nbreathe atmospheric air. Besides, the organs of respiration are\r\ngreatly changed. During the time the insect was in the larva state, it\r\nwas through the long tube fixed to the posterior part that it received\r\nor expelled the air; but in casting its skin it loses the tube, two\r\nappendages resembling an ass's ears being for the pupa what the tube\r\nwas for the larva, the opening of these ears being held above the\r\nsurface of the water. From this pupa the perfect insect will emerge;\r\nit is developed little by little, and the principal members may be\r\ndistinguished under the transparent membranous skin which envelopes\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen the insect is about to change from the pupa state, it lies on the\r\nsurface of the water, straightening the hind part of its body, and\r\nextending itself on the surface of the water, above which the thorax\r\nis raised. Before it has been a moment in this position, its skin\r\nsplits between the two breathing trumpets, the split increasing very\r\nrapidly in length and breadth.\r\n\r\n\"It leaves uncovered,\" says Réaumur, \"a portion of the thorax of the\r\ngnat, easily to be recognised by the freshness of its colour, which is\r\ngreen, and different from the skin in which it was before enveloped.\r\n\r\n\"As soon is the split is enlarged--and to do so sufficiently is the\r\nwork of a moment--the fore part of the perfect insect is not long in\r\nshowing itself; and soon afterwards the head appears, rising above the\r\nedges of the opening. But this moment, and those which follow, until\r\nthe gnat has entirely left its covering, are most critical, and when\r\nit is exposed to fearful danger. This insect, which lately lived in\r\nthe water, is suddenly in a position in which it has nothing to fear\r\nso much as water. If it were upset on the water, and the water were to\r\ntouch its thorax or body, it would be fatal. This is the way in which\r\nit acts in this critical position--As soon as it has got out its head\r\nand thorax, it lifts them as high as it is able above the opening\r\nthrough which they had emerged, and then draws the posterior part of\r\nits body through the same opening; or rather that part pushes itself\r\nforward by contracting a little and then lengthening again, the\r\nroughness of the covering from which it desires to extricate itself\r\nserving as an assistance.\r\n\r\n\"A larger portion of the gnat is thus uncovered, and at the same time\r\nthe head is advanced farther towards the anterior end of the covering;\r\nbut as it advances in this direction, it rises more and more, the\r\nanterior and posterior ends of the sheath thus becoming quite empty.\r\nThe sheath then becomes a sort of boat, into which the water does not\r\nenter; and it would be fatal if it did. The water could not find a\r\npassage to the farther end, and the edges of the anterior end could\r\nnot be submerged until the other was considerably sunk. The gnat\r\nitself is the mast of its little boat. Large boats, which pass under\r\nbridges, have masts which can be lowered; as soon as the boat has\r\npassed the bridge the mast is hoisted up by degrees, until it is\r\nperpendicular. The gnat rises thus until it becomes the mast of its\r\nown little boat, and a vertical mast also. It is difficult to imagine\r\nhow it is able to put itself in such a singular, though for it\r\nnecessary, position, and also how it can keep it. The fore part of the\r\nboat is much more loaded than the other, but it is also much broader.\r\nAny one who observes how deep the fore part of the boat is, and how\r\nnear the edges of its sides are to the water, forgets for the time\r\nbeing that the gnat is an insect that he would willingly destroy at\r\nother times. One feels uneasy for its fate; and the more so if the\r\nwind happens to rise, particularly if it disturbs the surface of the\r\nwater. But one sees with pleasure that there is air enough to carry\r\nthe gnat along quickly; it is carried from side to side; it makes\r\ndifferent voyages in the bucket in which it is borne. Though it\r\nis only a sort of boat--or rather mast, because its wings and legs\r\nare fixed close to its body, it is perhaps, in proportion to the\r\nsize of its boat, a larger sail than one would dare to put on a\r\nreal vessel--one cannot help fearing that the little boat will\r\ncapsize. * * * As soon as the boat is capsized, as soon as the gnat\r\nis laid on the surface of the water, there is no chance left for it.\r\nI have sometimes seen the water covered with gnats which had perished\r\nthus as soon as they were born. It is, however, still more extraordinary\r\nthat the gnat is able to finish its operations. Happily they do not last\r\nlong; all dangers may be passed over in a minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Gnats emerging.]\r\n\r\n\"The gnat, after raising itself perpendicularly, draws its two front\r\nlegs from the sheath, and brings them forward. It then draws out the\r\ntwo next. It now no longer tries to maintain its uneasy position, but\r\nleans towards the water; gets near it, and places its feet upon it;\r\nthe water is sufficiently firm and solid support for them, and is able\r\nto bear them, although burdened with the insect's body. As soon as the\r\ninsect is thus on the water it is in safety; its wings are unfolded\r\nand dried, which is done sooner than it takes to tell it, at length\r\nthe gnat is in a position to use them, and it is soon seen to fly\r\naway, particularly if one tries to catch it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Eggs of the Gnat, magnified.]\r\n\r\nOne more word about the gnat, whose life is full of such interesting\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps not feel much pleasure in learning that the\r\nfecundity of these insects is extraordinary. Many generations are born\r\nin a single year, each generation requiring only three weeks or a\r\nmonth to arrive at a condition to bring forth a new generation. Thus,\r\nthe number of gnats which comes into existence in the course of a\r\nyear is something fearful. Only a few days after the pupæ in a bucket\r\nare transformed into gnats, eggs which have been left by the females\r\nmay be observed on the surface of the water in little clusters.\r\n\r\nMany species of gnats, known as mosquitoes, are to be found in\r\nAmerica. All travellers speak of the sufferings endured by a stranger\r\nin that country from the bites of these insects. One can only preserve\r\noneself from these cruel enemies during sleep by hanging gauze, called\r\na mosquito curtain, round the bed. Mosquito curtains are not only\r\nnecessary in America; during the hot season, in Spain, throughout the\r\nwhole of Italy, and a part of the south of France, it is necessary to\r\nhang these curtains round the bed, if one wishes to obtain any sleep;\r\nit is also a necessary precaution not to have a light in one's\r\nbedchamber, as the sight of it at once attracts these dangerous\r\ncompanions, whose buzzing and stinging prevent any possibility of\r\nrepose during the whole night. Such is our advice to people who travel\r\nin the above-mentioned countries.\r\n\r\nThe _Tipulidæ_ have a narrow, elongated abdomen, and long and slight\r\nlimbs. The head is round, and the eyes, which are compound, are,\r\nespecially in the males, very large. The wings, which are long and\r\nnarrow, are sometimes held wide apart, sometimes horizontally, and\r\nsometimes bent so as to form, as it were, a roof. The balancers are\r\nnaked and elongated; the abdomen long, cylindrical, and often\r\nterminating in a club in the male, and in a point in the female. The\r\nantennæ, which are longer than the head, are generally composed of\r\nfrom fourteen to sixteen joints, and are sometimes in the form of a\r\ncomb or saw, sometimes furnished with hair, in form of plumes,\r\nbunches, or in a whorl. The larvæ live on plants, in the fields, in\r\ngardens, and sometimes in woods. The perfect insects, at first sight,\r\nresemble gnats, but are without a trunk, or rather their trunk is\r\nextremely short, terminating in two large lips, and the sucker is\r\ncomposed of two fibres only.[12] The larger species of _Tipulæ_, which\r\nare commonly known as \"Daddy Longlegs,\" &c., and in France as\r\n\"_Tailleurs_\" and \"_Couturières_,\" are found in fields at the end of\r\nSeptember and commencement of October.\r\n\r\n    [12] The genus _Cecidomyia_, which belongs to this family,\r\n    presents the most extraordinary instance of agamo-genesis--or\r\n    reproduction without fertilisation by another individual--at\r\n    present known among insects. Until lately it was almost an\r\n    axiom with naturalists that no insect was capable of\r\n    reproduction until it had attained its adult or perfect state.\r\n    Several Continental observers, some of them without any\r\n    knowledge of the others' discoveries, have found that the\r\n    _larvæ_ of some of the species of this genus reproduce larvæ\r\n    resembling themselves in every respect; and what is still more\r\n    strange, these larvæ live in a free state within the parent\r\n    larvæ, feeding upon its tissues, and causing its ultimate\r\n    destruction.\r\n\r\n    A very interesting article on this subject will be found in the\r\n    _Popular Science Review_ for the 1st April, 1868. The larvæ of\r\n    a species (_Cecidomyia tritici_) frequently causes much injury\r\n    to the wheat.--ED.\r\n\r\n\"Although they sometimes fly a considerable distance,\" says Réaumur,\r\n\"when the sun is bright and hot, they generally do not go far; often,\r\nindeed, only along the ground, or rather the top of the grass.\r\nSometimes they only use their wings to keep them above the level of\r\nthe herbage, and to take them along. Their legs, particularly the hind\r\nones, are disproportionately large. They are three times the length of\r\nthe body, and are to these insects what stilts are to the peasants of\r\nmarshy and inundated countries, enabling them to pass with ease over\r\nthe higher blades of grass.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the smaller species has been termed _culiciformis_, on account\r\nof its resemblance to the gnat. The smaller are more active than the\r\nlarger species which we have mentioned. Not only do they fly more\r\nrapidly, but there are some kinds which are continually on the wing.\r\nIn all seasons, even during the winter, at certain hours of the day,\r\nclouds of small insects are seen in the air, which are taken for\r\ngnats: they are _Tipulæ_. Their flight is worthy of attention; they\r\ngenerally only rise and fall in the same vertical line. All these\r\nflies come from larvæ, which resemble very elongated worms, having\r\nscaly heads, generally furnished with two very small conical antennæ,\r\nand certain other organs, for the purpose of obtaining food. Their\r\nbodies are jointed without limbs, but nevertheless provided with\r\nappendages which supply their place. The larvæ of the various species\r\nare of very different habits. Some are aquatic, as that of _Tipula\r\nculiciformis_, a small species which is very numerous in stagnant\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to say a few words about these worm-like larvæ, which\r\nare extremely common. They are of a brilliant red colour, and inhabit\r\nlittle oblong bent masses of earth, thickly pierced with holes. Each\r\nhole allows a worm to extend its head, and the foremost part of its\r\nbody, out of the cell, which is made of light spongy matters, remains\r\nof decayed leaves, &c. These larvæ are transformed into pupæ, in\r\nthe cell in which they have lived, during the larvæ state, losing by\r\nthis metamorphosis the scaly coverings of the head and of all the\r\nexterior parts. They pass into the pupa state, and have the thorax\r\nprovided with dainty plumes, which probably assist in the action of\r\nrespiration. This pupa is very active and quick in its movements in\r\nthe water. When the moment comes for its last metamorphosis, it throws\r\noff its feathery covering in much the same manner as the gnat.\r\n\r\nFig. 32 represents _Tipula oleracea_ in the different stages of larva,\r\npupa, and perfect insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Daddy Longlegs (_Tipula oleracea_).]\r\n\r\nOther species of small _Tipulæ_ have aquatic larvæ very similar to\r\nthose which we have described. Réaumur remarked that each of these\r\nworms is lodged in a thick mass, convex at the top, formed of a\r\ntransparent and adhesive white jelly. The larvæ of the larger _Tipulæ_\r\nare not aquatic, but are of different habits, and live under the\r\nground; all soil which is not frequently turned is suitable to them,\r\nbut they are to be found especially in low damp meadows.\r\n\r\nRéaumur saw large districts of grassy swamps in Poictou, which, in\r\ncertain years, furnished very little grass for the cattle, on account\r\nof the ravages caused by these larvæ. They had also much injured the\r\nharvest in the same districts during those years.\r\n\r\nThese larvæ appear to require no other food than vegetable mould.\r\nTheir excrements are, in fact, according to Réaumur, nothing else\r\nthan dried earth, from which the stomach and intestines of the insect\r\nhave withdrawn all nourishing matter.\r\n\r\nOld trees have often hollow cavities occasioned by the decay of the\r\ntrunk. When these cavities are old, their lower parts are full of a\r\nsort of mould, which is in fact half-decayed wood. It is there that\r\nthe _Tipulæ_ often lay their eggs. Réaumur frequently found the larvæ\r\nin the trunks of elms or willows, and also in the fleshy parts of\r\ncertain kinds of mushrooms. He carefully observed the habits of one,\r\nwhich lived under the covering of a mushroom, the Oak agaric\r\n(_Agaricus quercinus_). This larva is round, grey, and resembles an\r\nearth-worm. It does not walk, but crawls; and the places where it\r\nstops, or which it passes over, are covered with a sort of brilliant\r\nslime, like that left by the snail or slug.\r\n\r\nM. Guérin-Méneville has published some very interesting remarks on the\r\nmigrations of the larvæ of a particular kind of _Tipula_, known by the\r\nname of _Sciara_. We will borrow from that entomologist the following\r\ncurious details, which will initiate us into one of the most wonderful\r\nphenomena in the whole history of insects. These small larvæ are\r\nwithout feet, hardly five lines in length, and about the third of a\r\nline in diameter. They are composed of thirteen segments, and have\r\nsmall black heads.\r\n\r\nIn some years, during the month of July, may be found on the borders\r\nof forests in Norway and Hanover, immense trains of these larvæ,\r\nformed by the union of an innumerable quantity fixed to each other by\r\na sticky substance. These collections of larvæ resemble some sort of\r\nstrange animal of serpent-like form, several feet long, one or two\r\ninches in thickness, and formed by the union of an immense number,\r\nwhich cling to each other by thousands, and move on together. The\r\nwhole society advances thus with one accord, leaving a track after it\r\non the ground, as a material indication of its presence.\r\n\r\nThese strange collections of living creatures form societies,\r\nsometimes only a few yards long; but at other times it happens that\r\nthey form bands from ten to twelve yards in length, of the breadth of\r\na hand and the thickness of a thumb. M. Guérin-Méneville observed\r\ncolumns as many as thirty yards in length. These troops advance as\r\nslowly as a snail, and in a certain direction. If they encounter an\r\nobstacle--as a stone, for instance--they cross over it, turn round it,\r\nor else divide into two sections, which reunite after the obstacle is\r\npassed. If a portion of the column be removed so as to divide it into\r\ntwo parts, it is quickly reunited, as the hindmost portion soon joins\r\nthat which precedes it. Lastly, if the posterior part of this living\r\nribbon be brought into contact with the anterior, a circle is formed,\r\nwhich turns round and round on the same ground for a long time,\r\nsometimes even for a whole day, before breaking, and continuing to\r\nadvance. They are never met with in bad weather, but only when the sun\r\nis warm.\r\n\r\nThe curious and astonishing phenomenon of an assembly of larvæ without\r\nfeet, advancing with an equal movement resulting from the individual\r\nmotion of thousands of little worms, was remarked for the first time,\r\nin 1603, by Gaspard Schwenefelt. This naturalist says that the\r\ninhabitants of Siberia consider this phenomenon as an indication of a\r\nbad harvest if they go towards the mountains; whereas, if they descend\r\ntowards the plains, it is the sign of a good one. In 1715 Jonas Ramus\r\nmentioned the same phenomenon, recalling a superstition attached to it\r\nby the peasants of Norway. This writer informs us that the peasants of\r\nthat country, on meeting one of these moving columns, throw down their\r\nbelts or waistcoats on the ground before it. If the _orme-drag_ (that\r\nis the name given to the moving column) crosses over this obstacle, it\r\nis a good sign; but on the other hand, if the column turns round the\r\nobstacle, instead of crossing it, some mischief may be expected.\r\n\r\nThe same animals were observed in 1845 at Birkenmore, near Hefeld, by\r\nM. Rande, Royal Inspector of the Forests of Hanover.\r\n\r\nM. Guérin-Méneville is of opinion that these larvæ, which exist in\r\ngreat numbers in certain districts, sometimes devour all the nutritive\r\nsubstances contained in the ground. After having done so, they are\r\nobliged to come out of it, in order to seek at a distance a place\r\nwhere they will find food, or perhaps only a suitable place to undergo\r\ntheir metamorphosis. It is then that this singular journey commences.\r\nAs regards the uniting of these myriads of individuals into columns,\r\nM. Guérin-Méneville thinks that it can be explained by the necessity\r\nthese insects feel for mutual protection against the drying effect of\r\nthe atmosphere when they are forced to leave the ground. United into\r\nmasses, and moistened by the glutinous matter which connects them,\r\nthey can leave their former place of abode without danger; if each\r\nwere by itself, they would soon perish. Here, as in other cases, union\r\nis strength; and the strength of these larvæ lies in this protecting\r\nmoisture. However it may be explained, the migration of these troops\r\nof insects are among the most astonishing phenomena of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRACHYCERA.\r\n\r\nThe Brachycera, from [Greek: brachus], \"short;\" and [Greek: keras], \"a\r\nhorn\"--these Diptera having short antennæ--are divided into four\r\ngroups. In this subdivision the sucker is composed of six bristles.\r\nAmongst other families it includes that of the _Tabanidæ_; the insects\r\nbelonging to which family are of remarkable strength, and possessed of\r\ndaring and courage in the highest degree. Their wings are provided\r\nwith powerful muscles, their feet are very strong, and their trunk is\r\nprovided with six flat, sharp lancets. Distributed over the entire\r\nworld, their instinct is everywhere the same, it is the desire for\r\nblood, at least in the females; for the males are not so warlike, they\r\ndo no harm, but live on the juices of flowers. They are chiefly found\r\nin woods and pastures, and during the hottest part of the day in\r\nsummer may be seen flying about seeking for their prey.\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Fargeau has described the manner in which the males fly.\r\nThey may be seen flying hither and thither in the glades of woods,\r\nremaining for some time suspended in the air, then darting quickly and\r\nsuddenly away a yard or two, again taking up the same immovable\r\nposition, and in each of these movements turning the head to the\r\nopposite way from that in which they are going. This naturalist is\r\ncertain that on these occasions they are watching for the females,\r\nwhich they dart upon. When they have succeeded in doing so, they rise\r\nso high as to be out of sight.\r\n\r\nTo this group belongs the genus _Tabanus_.\r\n\r\nThe first species we shall mention, _Tabanus autumnalis_ (Fig. 33), a\r\ncommon species, is eight or nine lines in length, and of blackish\r\ncolour. The palpi, the face, and the forehead are grey; the antennæ\r\nblack; the thorax grey, striped with brown; the abdomen spotted with\r\nyellow; the legs of a yellowish white; and the outer edge of the wings\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nAnother species (_Tabanus bovinus_) is twelve lines in length, and of\r\na blackish brown. The palpi, the face, and the forehead are yellow;\r\nthe antennæ black, with a whitish base; the thorax, covered with\r\nyellow hair, is striped with black; the posterior edge of the segments\r\nof the abdomen pale yellow; the legs yellowish, with the extremities\r\nblack, and the exterior edge of the wings yellow. This species is\r\nfrequently met with in woods.\r\n\r\nA third species, _Chrysops cæcutiens_ (Fig. 34), which belongs to the\r\nsame family, and of which the generic name _Chrysops_ signifies\r\ngolden-eyed, torments horses and cattle very much by biting them round\r\nthe eyes. Its thorax is of a yellowish colour, striped or spotted with\r\nblack; the abdomen yellow, and the eyes golden.\r\n\r\nIn the next group of the Brachycera the sucker is composed of four\r\nbristles, and the antennæ generally terminate in a point which appears\r\nto be rather a development than an appendage.\r\n\r\nThis group includes a number of genera, but the following only possess\r\nsufficient interest to claim our attention. From the _Tanystomæ_ we\r\nselect the families of the _Asilidæ_, _Empidæ_, and _Bombylidæ_. As\r\ntypes of the _Brachystomæ_ we select the _Leptidæ_ and _Syrphidæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Tabanus autumnalis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Chrysops cæcutiens.]\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of the _Asilidæ_ is strength. All their\r\norgans combine to produce this quality, which they display only too\r\nmuch, being as formidable to cattle as the _Tabani_, but even\r\nsurpassing those insects in natural cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe _Asilidæ_ unceasingly attack other insects, and even those of\r\ntheir own kind. Their trunk is strong; one of the fibres of the sucker\r\nis furnished with small points, turned back, which are intended to\r\nhold firmly to the body into which it has entered. They carry on their\r\ndevastations in the glades of woods and on sunny roads.\r\n\r\nWe will mention in this group _Asilus crabroniformis_ (Fig. 35), an\r\ninsect ten to twelve lines long, having a yellow head, black antennæ,\r\nand thorax of a brownish yellow. The three first segments of the\r\nabdomen are black, the second and third having a white spot on each\r\nside, the remaining segments are yellow. The wings are yellowish,\r\nspotted with black on the inner and hind margin. This species is\r\ncommon over the whole of Europe, and lives at the expense of\r\ncaterpillars and other insects, of which it sucks the blood with the\r\ngreatest voracity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Asilus crabroniformis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Bombylius major.]\r\n\r\nThe _Empidæ_ live in the same way as the _Asilidæ_, but the males are\r\nchiefly nourished by the juices of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"They wage war on other insects,\" says M. Macquart, in his \"Histoire\r\nNaturelle des Diptères,\" \"either when flying or running, and they\r\nseize their victims with their feet, which are formed in various ways,\r\nand well adapted for their purpose, but it is in the air that their\r\nhunting, as well as their amours, chiefly take place. They unite\r\ntogether in numerous companies, which during fine summer evenings\r\nwhirl like gnats about the water's edge. A singular observation,\r\nhowever, that I have made on the _Empis_, is, that among the thousands\r\nof pairs that I have seen resting on hedges and bushes, nearly all the\r\nfemales were occupied in sucking an insect; some had hold of small\r\n_Phryganeæ_,[13] others of _Ephemeræ_,[14] and the greater part of\r\n_Tipulæ_.\"\r\n\r\n    [13] The insects produced from the caddis or case-worm.--ED.\r\n\r\n    [14] May-fly family.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe _Empidæ_ have the trunk bent down, and resembling the beak of a\r\nbird; but the _Bombylidæ_, on the contrary, have the trunk extended\r\nstraight in front.\r\n\r\nThe typical genus which has given its name to this latter group is\r\neasily to be recognised by the elegance of the fur which covers its\r\nbody, the slenderness of its feet, and the length of its wings, which\r\nextend horizontally on each side of the body.\r\n\r\nMuch more common in hot climates than in the North, these insects, the\r\nlarvæ of which are not yet known, take flight in the middle of the\r\nday, when the sun's rays are hottest. They fly very fast, making a\r\ndull buzzing sound, and hover over flowers, from which they draw the\r\njuices without settling.\r\n\r\nFig. 36 represents the _Bombylius major_, which is common enough\r\nthroughout the whole of Europe. This insect is from four to six lines\r\nlong, black, with yellow fur; the feet light yellow; and the wings\r\nhave the edges bordered with a sinuous brown band.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Anthrax_, belonging to this family, has a different form to\r\n_Bombylius_. The body is much less hairy; the trunk is short and\r\nconcealed in the mouth; the wings, which are very large, are clothed,\r\nat least in the principal genus, in a garb of mourning, sufficiently\r\nremarkable, in which the combinations of black and white are admirably\r\ndiversified.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" says M. Macquart, \"the line which separates the two colours is\r\nstraight; there it represents gradations, in other cases it is deeply\r\nsinuous. Sometimes the dark part shows transparent points, or the\r\nglassy part dark spots. This sombre garb, added to the velvet black of\r\nthe body, gives the Anthrax a most elegant appearance; and while\r\nresting on the corolla of the honeysuckle and hawthorn to suck the\r\njuice, forms a most striking contrast, and sets forth its beauty no\r\nless than that of those lovely flowers.\"\r\n\r\n_Anthrax sinuata_ is common in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe family of the _Syrphidæ_ includes three remarkable types, which we\r\ncannot pass over in silence. They are _Vermileo_, _Volucella_, and\r\n_Helophilus_.\r\n\r\n_Vermileo de Geeri_ (Fig. 37), which inhabits the central and southern\r\nparts of France, is four or five lines in length. Its face is white;\r\nits forehead grey, bordered with black; the thorax of a yellowish\r\ngrey, with four brown stripes in the male; the abdomen light yellow,\r\nspotted with black; and the wings glassy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Vermileo de Geeri.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--A species of Volucella.]\r\n\r\nThe larva of the _Vermileo_ has a thin cylindrical body, capable of\r\nbending itself in every direction; a conical head, armed with two\r\nhorny points; and the last segment elongated, flat, elevated, and\r\nterminated by four hairy tentacles; at the sides of the fifth segment\r\nmay be observed a little angle, from which projects a horny retractile\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIt is of very singular habits. It makes a small tunnel in the sand,\r\nhaving a conical mouth, where it waits, like the spider, immovable. As\r\nsoon as an insect falls into the hole, it raises its head, and\r\nsqueezing its prey in the folds of its body, devours it, and\r\nafterwards throws out the skin. It lives in this way for at least\r\nthree years before attaining the perfect state.\r\n\r\nThe _Volucellæ_ (Fig. 38) have a strong resemblance to the humble-bee.\r\nCertain kinds make use and abuse of this resemblance to introduce\r\nthemselves fraudulently into its nests, and to deposit their eggs\r\ntherein. When these eggs have hatched, the larvæ, which have the mouth\r\narmed with two mandibles, devour the larvæ of their hosts, the bees.\r\nThis is the return they make for the hospitality they have received!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--A species of Helophilus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Larvæ of a Helophilus.]\r\n\r\nThe _Helophili_ (Fig. 39) deserve to be mentioned here on account of\r\nthe singular form of many of their larvæ. The head is thick, fleshy,\r\nand varying a little in form. But the point by which they are easily\r\nto be distinguished from most other larvæ is, that they have always\r\nvery long tails, sometimes, indeed, out of proportion to the length of\r\nthe body. Réaumur called these larvæ \"vers à queue de rat;\" they are\r\nknown in England as rat-tailed maggots, and their habits are aquatic.\r\nHaving placed some of them in a bason of water, Réaumur saw that they\r\nkept in a perpendicular position at the bottom of the bason and\r\nparallel to one another, the extremities of their tails being on the\r\nsurface of the water. He then increased the depth of the water by\r\ndegrees; and, as it got deeper, observed that the tail of each worm\r\nbecame longer. These tails, which at first were only two inches long,\r\nat last attained to five.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that the body of each worm does not exceed five\r\nlines in length. The tail is a peculiar organ, by the aid of which the\r\nworm breathes, although its body may be covered by water to the depth\r\nof several inches. It is composed of two tubes, one of which shuts\r\ninto the other, like a telescope. Réaumur calls it the breathing tube.\r\nIt terminates in a little brown knob, in which, according to Réaumur,\r\nare two holes for the purpose of receiving the air, and which have\r\nfive little tufts of hair, which float on the surface of the water.\r\nWhen the time comes for the metamorphosis of these worms, they come\r\nout of the water and bury themselves in the earth; the skin then\r\nhardens and becomes a sort of cocoon. In this cocoon the insect loses\r\nthe form of a worm, and takes by degrees that of the pupa, which it\r\nkeeps until circumstances cause it to throw off its last coverings,\r\nand to appear in the winged state.\r\n\r\nWhat an eventful life! what a life full of changes and turns of\r\nfortune is that of these insects, which pass the first and longest\r\nperiod of their existence under water, another part of their life\r\nunder the ground, and, finally, after having existed in these two\r\nelements, enjoy, high in the air, the pleasures of flight!\r\n\r\nThe third group of Brachycera is that of the _Dichæta_; that is, those\r\nflies having two-fibred suckers. Among these are classed the\r\n_OEstri_, the _Conopes_, and the flies properly so called.\r\n\r\nThe genus _OEstrus_, the Gad, Bot-fly, or Breeze, comprises those\r\nformidable insects which attack the horse, the sheep, and the ox.[15]\r\nThe labours of Réaumur, in his admirable Memoirs, and those of M.\r\nJoly, Professor of Zoology to the Faculté des Sciences de Toulouse,\r\nwho published some most valuable researches on this subject, in 1846,\r\nwill guide us in the following brief explanation.\r\n\r\n    [15] Mr. Bates, in his interesting \"Naturalist on the Amazons,\"\r\n    mentions an _OEstrus_ as occurring in those regions, which\r\n    deposits its eggs in the human flesh, the larva causing a\r\n    swelling which resembles a boil.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe following is the description given by M. Joly of the Gad-fly\r\n(_OEstrus equi_) represented in Figs. 41, 42, which are taken from a\r\ndrawing which accompanies that naturalist's Memoirs.\r\n\r\nThe head of this insect is large and obtuse; the face light yellow,\r\nwith whitish silky fur; the eyes blackish; the antennæ ferruginous;\r\nthe thorax grey; and the abdomen of a reddish yellow, with black\r\nspots. The wings are whitish, not diaphanous, with a golden tint, and\r\ndivided by a winding band of blackish colour. The feet are palish\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I. A Herd of Horses attacked by Gad-flies (_OEstrus\r\nequi_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Horse-fly, male (_OEstrus_ [_gasterophilus_]\r\n_equi_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Horse-fly, female (_OEstrus_ [_gasterophilus_]\r\n_equi_).]\r\n\r\nThis species is found in France, in Italy, and also in the East,\r\nespecially in Persia, and rarely in England. During the months of July\r\nand August the _OEstrus_ frequents pastures, and deposits its eggs\r\nchiefly on the shoulders and knees of horses (PLATE I.). In order to\r\ndo this, the female suspends herself in the air for some seconds over\r\nthe place she has chosen, falls upon it, and with her abdomen bent,\r\nsticks her eggs to the horse's hairs by means of a glutinous liquid\r\nwith which they are provided, and which soon dries. This is repeated\r\nat very short intervals. It often happens that from four to five\r\nhundred eggs are thus deposited upon the same horse. Guided by a\r\nmarvellous instinct, the female _OEstrus_ generally places her eggs\r\non those parts of the horse's body which can be most easily touched\r\nwith the tongue, that is, at the inner part of the knees, on the\r\nshoulders, and rarely on the outer part of the mane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Eggs of the Gad-fly (_OEstrus_\r\n[_gasterophilus_] _equi_) deposited on the hairs of a horse.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the _OEstrus_, which are white and of conical form,\r\nadhere to the horse's hair, as shown in Fig. 43. They are furnished\r\nwith a lid, which at the time of hatching opens, to allow the exit of\r\nthe young larva, which takes place, according to M. Joly, about twenty\r\ndays after they are deposited. In fact, it is not in the egg state,\r\nbut really in that of the larva, that the horse, as we shall explain,\r\ntakes into his stomach these parasitical guests, to which Nature has\r\nallotted so singular an abode. When licking itself, the horse carries\r\nthem into its mouth, and afterwards swallows them with his food, by\r\nwhich means they enter the stomach. It is a remarkable fact that it is\r\nsometimes other insects, as the _Tabania_ for instance, that by their\r\nrepeated stinging cause the horse to lick himself, and thus to receive\r\nhis most cruel enemy. In the perilous journey they have to perform\r\nfrom the skin of the horse to his stomach, many of the larvæ of the\r\n_OEstrus_, as may be supposed, are destroyed, ground by the teeth of\r\nthe animal, or crushed by the alimentary substances. There is hardly\r\none _OEstrus_ in fifty that arrives safely in the stomach of the\r\nhorse; and yet if one were to open a horse which had been attacked by\r\nthe _OEstri_, the stomach would be nearly always found to have many\r\nof the larvæ sticking to its inside. Fig. 44, taken from a drawing\r\nwhich accompanies M. Joly's Memoirs, represents the state of a horse's\r\nstomach attacked by the Gad-fly larvæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Portion of the stomach of the horse, and\r\nlarvæ of OEstrus (gasterophilus) equi.]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ are of a reddish yellow, and each of their segments is armed\r\nat the posterior edge with a double row of triangular spines, large\r\nand small alternately, yellow at the base, and black at the point,\r\nwhich is always turned backwards. The head is furnished with two\r\nhooks, which serve to fasten the larva to the internal coats of the\r\nstomach. The spines with which the whole surface of the body is\r\nfurnished contribute to fix it more perfectly, preventing the\r\ncreatures, by the manner in which they are placed, from being carried\r\naway by the food which has gone through the first process of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this larva, so singularly deposited, is nourished\r\nby the mucus secreted by the mucous membrane of the stomach, and that\r\nit breathes the air which the horse swallows with its food during the\r\nprocess of deglutition. It must be acknowledged, however, that it is\r\nin the midst of a gaseous atmosphere which is very unhealthy, for\r\nnearly all the gases generated in the stomach of the horse are fatal\r\nto man and to the generality of animals, as they consist of nitrogen,\r\ncarbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and carburetted hydrogen. To\r\nexplain how the insect can live under such circumstances, M. Joly has\r\nsuggested the following ingenious hypothesis:--\r\n\r\n\"When the stomach which the larva inhabits,\" says this learned\r\nnaturalist, \"contains only oxygen, or air that is nearly pure, the\r\ninsect opens the two lips of the cavity which contains the spiracles,\r\nand breathes at its ease. When the digestion of the alimentary\r\nsubstance generates gas which is unfit for respiration, or when the\r\nspiracles run the risk of being obstructed by the solid or liquid\r\nsubstances contained in the stomach, it shuts the lips, and continues\r\nto live on the air contained in its numerous tracheæ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the value of this explanation,\" adds M. Joly, \"it is\r\nnevertheless very curious to see an insect pass the greater part of\r\nits life in an atmosphere which would be instantly fatal to most\r\nanimals, and in an organ where, under the government of life, chemical\r\nprocesses bring about the most wonderful changes of the food into the\r\nsubstance of the animal itself. But how can the insect itself resist\r\nthe action of these mysterious powers, and remain alone intact in the\r\nmidst of all these matters which are unceasingly changing and\r\ndecomposing? This is another question which it is difficult, or rather\r\nimpossible, to explain in the present state of science; another enigma\r\nwhich humbles our pride, and of which He who has created both man and\r\nthe worm alone knows the secret.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at a state of complete development, the larva of the\r\n_OEstrus_ imprisoned in the stomach of the horse leaves the membrane\r\nto which it has been fixed, then directing the anterior part of its\r\nbody towards the pyloric opening of the stomach, allows itself to be\r\ncarried away with the excrementitious matter. It traverses, mixed with\r\nthe excrementary bolus, the whole length of the intestinal canal,\r\nleaves it by the anal orifice, and on touching the ground at once\r\nseeks a suitable place to go through the last but one of its\r\nmetamorphoses.\r\n\r\nThe skin then gets thick, hardens, and becomes black. All the organs\r\nof the animal are composed of a whitish amorphous pulp, which soon\r\nassumes its destined form, and the insect becomes perfect. It then\r\nlifts a lid at the anterior part of its cocoon, emerges, dries its\r\nwings, and flies off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Bot-fly (_OEstrus bovis_).]\r\n\r\nThe Bot-fly (_OEstrus bovis_, Fig. 45) has a very hairy body, large\r\nhead, the face and forehead covered with light yellow hair, the eyes\r\nbrown, and the antennæ black. The thorax is yellow, barred with black;\r\nthe abdomen of a greyish white at the base, covered with black hair on\r\nthe third segment, and the remainder of an orange yellow; the wings\r\nare smoky brown.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cattle are attacked, they may be seen, their heads and\r\nnecks extended, their tails trembling, and held in a line with the\r\nbody, to rush to the nearest river or pond, while such as are not\r\nattacked disperse (PLATE II.). It is asserted that the buzzing alone\r\nof the _OEstrus_ terrifies a bullock to such an extent as to\r\nrender it unmanageable. As for the insect, it simply obeys its\r\nmaternal instinct, which commands it to deposit its eggs under the\r\nskin of our large ruminants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II. A Herd of Cattle attacked by Bot-flies (_OEstrus\r\nbovis_).]\r\n\r\nLet us now explain how the eggs of the _OEstrus_, deposited in the\r\nskin of the bullock, accommodate themselves to this strange abode. The\r\nmother insect makes a certain number of little wounds in the skin of\r\nthe beast, each of which receives an egg, which the heat of the animal\r\nserves to bring forth. It is a natural parallel to the artificial way\r\nwhich the ancient Egyptians invented of hatching the eggs of domestic\r\nfowls, and which has been imitated badly enough in our day.\r\n\r\nDirectly the larva of the Bot-fly is out of the egg and lodged between\r\nthe skin and the flesh of its host, the bullock, it finds itself in a\r\nplace perfectly suitable to its existence. In this happy condition the\r\nlarva increases in growth, and eventually becomes a fly in its turn.\r\nThose parts of the animal's body in which the larvæ are lodged are\r\neasily to be recognised, as above each larva may be seen an elevation,\r\na sort of tumour, termed a bot--a bump, as Réaumur calls it, comparing\r\nit more or less justly to the bump caused on a man's head by a severe\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nFig. 46, taken from a drawing in Réaumur's Memoirs, represents the\r\nbots of which we speak.\r\n\r\nThe country people are well aware of the nature and cause of these\r\nbots. They know that each one contains a worm, that this worm comes\r\nfrom a fly, and that later it will be transformed into a fly itself.\r\nEach of these bots has in its interior a cavity, occupied by a larva,\r\nwhich, as well as the bot, increases in size as the larva becomes\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nIt is generally on young cows or young bullocks--in fact, on cattle of\r\nfrom two to three years of age--that these tumours exist, and they are\r\nrarely to be seen on old animals. The fly, which by piercing the skin\r\noccasions these tumours, always chooses those whose skin offers little\r\nresistance. Each tumour is provided with a small opening, by which the\r\nlarva breathes.\r\n\r\nIn order to examine the interior of the cavity, Réaumur opened some of\r\nthese tumours, either with a razor or a pair of scissors. He found\r\nthem in a most disgusting state. The larva is lodged in a regular\r\nfestering wound, matter occupying the bottom of the cavity, and the\r\nhead of the worm is continually, or almost continually, plunged in\r\nthis liquid. \"It is most likely very well off there,\" says Réaumur;\r\nand he adds that this matter appears to be the sole food of the\r\nlarva.\r\n\r\n\"The position of a horned beast,\" observes the great naturalist,\r\n\"which has thirty or forty of these bumps on its back, would be a very\r\ncruel one, and a terrible state of suffering, if his flesh were\r\ncontinually mangled by thirty or forty large worms. But it is probable\r\nthey cause no suffering, or at least very little, to the large animal.\r\nBesides,\" continues Réaumur, \"those cattle whose bodies are the most\r\ncovered with bumps, not only show no signs of pain, but it does not\r\nappear that they are prejudicial to them in any way.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Bumps produced on Cattle by the larvæ of the\r\nBot-fly.]\r\n\r\nRéaumur tried to discover how the larva, when arrived at its full\r\ngrowth, succeeds in leaving its abode, as the opening is smaller than\r\nits own body.\r\n\r\n\"Nature,\" says Réaumur, \"has taught this worm the surest, the\r\ngentlest, and the most simple of methods, the one to which surgeons\r\noften have recourse to hold wounds open, or to enlarge them. They\r\npress _tents_ into a wound they wish to enlarge. Two or three days\r\nbefore the worm wishes to come out, it commences to make use of its\r\nposterior part as a tent, to increase the size of its exit from its\r\nhabitation. It thrusts it into the hole and draws it out again many\r\ntimes in the course of two or three days, and the oftener this is\r\nrepeated, the longer it is able to retain its posterior end in the\r\nopening, as the hole becomes larger. On the day preceding that on\r\nwhich the worm is to come out, the posterior part is to be found\r\nalmost continually in the hole. At last, it comes out backwards, and\r\nfalls to the ground, when it gets under a stone, or buries itself in\r\nthe turf; remaining quiet and preparing for its last transformation.\r\nIts skin hardens, the rings disappear, and it becomes black.\r\nThenceforth the insect is detached from the outer skin, which forms a\r\ncocoon, or box. At the front and upper part of the cocoon is a\r\ntriangular piece, which the fly gets rid of when it is in a fit state\r\nto come into the open air.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 47, taken from drawings in Réaumur's Memoirs, represents the\r\nimago of the _OEstrus_ leaving the cocoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Imago of Bot-fly emerging.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Ovipositor of the Bot-fly (_OEstrus bovis_).]\r\n\r\nThe reader is, most likely, desirous to know with the aid of what\r\ninstrument the _OEstrus_ is able to pierce the thick skin of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe female only is possessed of this instrument, which is situated in\r\nthe posterior extremity of the body. It is of a shiny blackish brown\r\ncolour, and as it were covered with scales. By pressing the abdomen of\r\nthe fly between one's two fingers it is thrust out. Réaumur observed\r\nthat it was formed of four tubes, which could be drawn the one into\r\nthe other, like the tubes of a telescope (Fig. 48). The last of these\r\nappears to terminate in five small scaly knobs, which are not placed\r\non the same line, but are the ends of five different parts. Three of\r\nthese knobs are furnished with points, which form an instrument well\r\nfitted to operate upon a hard thick skin. United together, they form a\r\ncavity similar to that of an auger, and terminating in the form of a\r\nspoon.\r\n\r\nThe Gad-fly, or Breeze-fly of the sheep, _OEstrus_ (_Cephalemyia\r\novis_), has obtained notoriety on account of its attacking those\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nEven at the sight of this insect the sheep feels the greatest terror.\r\nAs soon as one of them appears, the flock becomes disturbed, the sheep\r\nthat is attacked shakes its head when it feels the fly on its nostril,\r\nand at the same time strikes the ground violently with its fore-feet;\r\nit then commences to run here and there, holding its nose near the\r\nground, smelling the grass, and looking about anxiously to see if it\r\nis still pursued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Cephalemyia ovis.]\r\n\r\nIt is to avoid the attacks of the _Cephalemyia_ that during the hot\r\ndays of summer sheep lie down with their nostrils buried in dusty\r\nruts, or stand up with their heads lowered between their fore-legs,\r\nand their noses nearly in contact with the ground. When these poor\r\nbeasts are in the open country, they are observed assembled with their\r\nnostrils against each other and very near the ground, so that those\r\nwhich occupy the outside are alone exposed (PLATE III.). The\r\n_Cephalemyia ovis_ (Fig. 49) has a less hairy head, but larger in\r\nproportion to the size of its body than the Gad-fly (_Gasterophilus\r\nequi_). Its face is reddish; its forehead brown with purple bars; its\r\neyes of a dark and changing green; its antennæ black, its thorax\r\nsometimes grey, sometimes brown, bristling with small black\r\ntubercles; the abdomen white, spotted with brown or black; and the\r\nwings hyaline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III. Sheep attacked by _Cephalemyia ovis_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cephalemyia_ (_OEstrus_) _ovis_ is to be found in Europe,\r\nArabia, Persia, and in the East Indies. It lays its eggs on the edges\r\nof the animal's nostrils, and the larva lives in the frontal and\r\nmaxillary sinuses. It is a whitish worm, having a black transverse\r\nband on each of its segments. Its head is armed with two horny black\r\nhooks, parallel, and capable of being moved up and down and laterally.\r\nUnderneath, each segment of the body has several rows of tubercles of\r\nnearly spherical form, surmounted by small bristles having reddish\r\npoints, and all of them bent backwards. \"These points,\" says M. Joly,\r\n\"probably serve to facilitate the progress of the animal on the smooth\r\nand slippery surfaces of the mucous membranes to which it fixes itself\r\nto feed, and perhaps also to increase the secretion of these membranes\r\nby the irritation occasioned by the bristles with which they are\r\nfurnished.\"[16]\r\n\r\n    [16] \"Recherches sur les OEstrides en général, et\r\n    particulièrement sur les OEstres qui attaquent l'homme, le\r\n    cheval, le boeuf, et le mouton.\" Par N. Joly, Professeur à la\r\n    Faculté des Sciences de Toulouse. P. 63. Lyons, 1846.\r\n\r\nFixed by means of these hooks to the mucous membrane, which it\r\nperforates, the larva nourishes itself with mucus, and lives in this\r\nstate, according to M. Joly, during nearly a whole year. At the end of\r\nthis time it comes out, following the same course by which it entered,\r\nfalls to the ground, and burying itself to the depth of a few inches,\r\nis transformed into a pupa. The cocoon is of a fine black colour.\r\nThirty or forty days after its burial it emerges in the perfect state,\r\nand detaching the lid at the anterior end of the cocoon by the aid of\r\nits head, which has increased considerably in size, takes flight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Conops.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the formidable appearance of their trunks, the habits\r\nof the perfect _Conopes_ (Fig. 50) are very quiet. In the adult state\r\nthey are only to be seen on flowers, of which they suck the honeyed\r\njuice. But with their larvæ the case is otherwise. These latter live\r\nas parasites on the humble-bees (_Bombi_). Latreille saw the _Conops\r\nrufipes_ issue in the perfect state from the body of a humble-bee,\r\nthrough the intervals of the segments of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe _Mucides_ form that great tribe of Diptera commonly known as\r\nflies, and which are distributed in such abundance over the whole\r\nworld. Faithful companions of plants, the flies follow them to the\r\nutmost limits of vegetation. At the same time they are called upon by\r\nNature to hasten the dissolution of dead bodies. They place their eggs\r\nin the carcases of animals, and the larvæ prey upon the corrupt flesh,\r\nthus quickly ridding the earth of those fatal causes of infection to\r\nits inhabitants. The organs of these insects are also infinitely\r\nmodified, in order to adapt them to their various functions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Echinomyia grossa.]\r\n\r\nM. Macquart divides the _Muscides_ into three sections--the\r\n_Creophili_, the _Anthomyzides_, and the _Acalyptera_.\r\n\r\nThe _Creophili_ have the strongest organisation; their movements and\r\ntheir flight are rapid. The greater part feed on the juices of\r\nflowers, some on the blood or the humours of animals. Some deposit\r\ntheir eggs on different kinds of insects, others on bodies in a state\r\nof decomposition, some again are viviparous. The insects of the genus\r\n_Echinomyia_, for instance (Fig. 51), derive their nourishment from\r\nflowers. They deposit their eggs on caterpillars, and the young larvæ\r\non hatching penetrate their bodies and feed on their viscera. How\r\nsurprised, sometimes, is the naturalist, who, after carefully\r\npreserving a chrysalis, and awaiting day by day the appearance of the\r\nbeautiful butterfly of which it is the coarse and mysterious envelope,\r\nsees a cloud of flies emerge in place of it!\r\n\r\nBut there is another singular manoeuvre performed by some of the\r\nspecies of the Diptera with which we are at present occupied to\r\nprepare an abundant supply of provision for their larvæ as soon as\r\nthey are hatched. The following are the means they employ. It is well\r\nknown that certain fossorial Hymenoptera carry their prey--other\r\ninsects which they have caught, weevils, flies, &c., and which they\r\nintend should serve as food for their own larvæ--into their\r\nsubterranean abodes. These Diptera, spying a favourable moment, slip\r\nfurtively into their retreats, and deposit their eggs on the very food\r\nwhich was intended for others. Their larvæ, which are soon hatched,\r\nmake great havoc among the provisions gathered together in the cave,\r\nand cause the legitimate proprietors to die of starvation.\r\n\r\n\"This instinct,\" says M. Macquart, \"is accompanied by the greatest\r\nagility, obstinacy, and audacity, which are necessary to carry on this\r\nbrigandage; and, on the other hand, the Hymenoptera, seized with fear,\r\nor stupefied, offer no resistance to their enemies, and although they\r\ncarry on a continual war against different insects, and particularly\r\nagainst different _Muscides_, they never seize those of whom they have\r\nso much to complain, and which, nevertheless, have no arms to oppose\r\nthem with.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Sarcophagæ_ are a very common family of Diptera, and are chiefly\r\nto be found on flowers, from which they steal the juice. The females\r\ndo not lay eggs, but are viviparous.\r\n\r\nRéaumur, with his usual care, observed this remarkable instance of\r\nviviparism proved in a fly, which seeks those parts of our houses\r\nwhere meat is kept to deposit its larvæ. This fly is grey, its legs\r\nare black, and its eyes red.\r\n\r\nWhen one of them is taken and held between the fingers, there may\r\noften be seen a small, oblong, whitish, cylindrical worm come out of\r\nthe posterior part of the body, and shake itself in order to disengage\r\nitself thoroughly. It has no sooner freed itself than the head of\r\nanother begins to show. Thirty or forty sometimes come out in this\r\nmanner, and, on pressing the abdomen of the fly slightly, more than\r\neighty of these larvæ may sometimes be made to come out in a short\r\nspace of time. If a piece of meat be put near these worms, they\r\nquickly get into it, and eat greedily. They grow rapidly, attaining\r\ntheir full size in a few days, and make a cocoon of their skin, from\r\nwhich in a certain time the imago issues. If the body of one of these\r\novo-viviparous flies (for the eggs hatch within the parent) be opened,\r\na sort of thick ribbon of spiral form is soon seen. This ribbon\r\nappears at first sight to be nothing but an assemblage of worms,\r\nplaced alongside of and parallel to one another.\r\n\r\nEach worm has a thin white membranous envelope, similar to those\r\nlight spiders' webs which float about in autumn, which the French call\r\n_fils de la vierge_, and we denominate _gossamer_.\r\n\r\nThe fecundity of this fly is very great, for, in the length of a\r\nquarter of an inch, the envelope in which these small worms are\r\nenclosed contains 2,000 of them. Therefore this ribbon, being two\r\ninches and a half long, contains about 20,000 worms.\r\n\r\nThe members of the genus _Stomoxys_, though nearly related to the\r\nhouse-fly, differ from it very much in habits. They live on the blood\r\nof animals. The _Stomoxys calcitrans_ is very common in these\r\nclimates. Its palpi are tawny yellow, antennæ black, thorax striped\r\nwith black, abdomen spotted with brown, and its trunk hard, thin, and\r\nlong. It deposits its eggs on the carcases of large animals.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Fly, _Lucilia Cæsar_, lays its eggs on cut-up meat, or on\r\ndead animals. It is only three or four lines in length, of a golden\r\ngreen, with the palpi ferruginous, antennæ brown, and feet black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Lucilia hominivorax.]\r\n\r\nA species of this genus, the _Lucilia hominivorax_, has lately\r\nobtained a melancholy notoriety. We are indebted to M. Charles\r\nCoquerel, surgeon in the French Imperial navy, for the most exact\r\ninformation concerning this dangerous Dipteron, and the revelation of\r\nthe dangers to which man is liable in certain parts of the globe. But\r\nlet us first describe the insect, which is very pretty and of\r\nbrilliant colours.\r\n\r\nFig. 52, taken from M. Charles Coquerel's Memoir, represents the larva\r\nand the perfect insect, as well as the horny mandibles with which the\r\nlarva is provided. It is rather more than the third of an inch in\r\nlength, the head is large, downy, and of a golden yellow. The thorax\r\nis dark blue and very brilliant, with reflections of purple, as is\r\nalso the abdomen. The wings are transparent, and have rather the\r\nappearance of being smoked; their margins, as well as the feet, are\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful insect is an assassin. M. Coquerel has informed us that\r\nit sometimes occasions the death of those wretched convicts whom human\r\njustice has transported to the distant penitentiary of Cayenne.\r\n\r\nWhen one of these degraded beings, who live in a state of sordid\r\nfilth, goes to sleep, a prey to intoxication, it happens sometimes\r\nthat this fly gets into his mouth and nostrils; it lays its eggs\r\nthere, and when they are changed into larvæ, the death of the victim\r\ngenerally follows.[17]\r\n\r\n    [17] \"The majority of convicts attacked by the _Lucilia\r\n    hominivorax_,\" says M. F. Bouyer, captain of the frigate, in\r\n    \"Un Voyage à la Guyane Française,\" \"have succumbed, despite the\r\n    assistance of science. Cures have been the exception: in a\r\n    dozen cases three or four are reported.\"--_Tour du Monde, 1866,\r\n    1er Semestre_, p. 318.\r\n\r\nThese larvæ are of an opaque white colour, a little over half an inch\r\nin length, and have eleven segments. They are lodged in the interior\r\nof the nasal orifices and the frontal sinuses, and their mouths are\r\narmed with two very sharp horny mandibles. They have been known to\r\nreach the ball of the eye, and to gangrene the eyelids. They enter the\r\nmouth, corrode and devour the gums and the entrance of the throat, so\r\nas to transform those parts into a mass of putrid flesh, a heap of\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nLet us turn away from this horrible description, and observe that this\r\nhominivorous fly is not, properly speaking, a parasite of man, as it\r\nonly attacks him accidentally, as it would attack any animal that was\r\nin a daily state of uncleanliness.\r\n\r\nIn many works on medicine may be found mentioned a circumstance which\r\noccurred twenty years ago, at the surgery of M. J. Cloquet. The story\r\nis perhaps not very agreeable, but is so interesting as regards the\r\nsubject with which we are occupied, that we think it ought to be\r\nrepeated here. One day a poor wretch, half dead, was brought to the\r\nHôtel-Dieu. He was a beggar, who, having some tainted meat in his\r\nwallet, had gone to sleep in the sun under a tree. He must have slept\r\nlong, as the flies had time enough to deposit their eggs on the\r\ntainted meat, and the larvæ time enough to be hatched, and to devour\r\nthe beggar's meat. It seems that the larvæ enjoyed the repast, for\r\nthey passed from the dead meat to the living flesh, and after\r\ndevouring the meat they commenced to eat the owner. Awoke by the\r\npain, the beggar was taken to the Hôtel-Dieu, where he expired.\r\n\r\nWho would suppose that one of the causes which render the centre of\r\nAfrica difficult to be explored is a fly not larger than the\r\nhouse-fly? The Tsetse fly (Fig. 53) is of brown colour, with a few\r\ntransverse yellow stripes across the abdomen, and with wings longer\r\nthan its body. It is not dangerous to man, to any wild animals, or to\r\nthe pig, the mule, the ass, or the goat. But it stings mortally the\r\nox, the horse, the sheep, and the dog, and renders the countries of\r\nCentral Africa uninhabitable for those valuable animals. It seems to\r\npossess very sharp sight. \"It darts from the top of a bush as quick as\r\nan arrow on the object it wishes to attack,\" writes a traveller, M. de\r\nCastelnau.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--The Tsetse Fly (_Glossina morsitans_).]\r\n\r\nMr. Chapman, one of the travellers who have advanced the farthest into\r\nthe middle of Southern Africa, relates that he covered his body with\r\nthe greatest care to avoid the bites of this nimble enemy; but if a\r\nthorn happened to make a nearly imperceptible hole in his clothing, he\r\noften saw the Tsetse, who appeared to know that it could not penetrate\r\nthe cloth, dart forward and bite him on the uncovered part. The\r\nsucker of blood secretes--in a gland placed at the base of his\r\ntrunk--so subtle a poison, that three or four flies are sufficient to\r\nkill an ox.\r\n\r\nThe _Glossina morsitans_ abounds on the banks of the African river,\r\nthe Zambesi, frequenting the bushes and reeds that border it. It\r\nlikes, indeed, all aquatic situations. The African cattle recognise at\r\ngreat distances the buzzing of this sanguinary enemy, and this fatal\r\nsound causes them to feel the greatest fear.\r\n\r\nLivingstone, the celebrated traveller, in crossing those regions of\r\nAfrica that are watered by the Zambesi, lost forty-three magnificent\r\noxen by the bites of the Tsetse fly, notwithstanding that they were\r\ncarefully watched, and had been very little bitten.\r\n\r\n\"A most remarkable feature in the bite of the Tsetse is its perfect\r\nharmlessness in man and wild animals, and even calves so long as they\r\ncontinue to suck the cows. We never experienced the slightest injury\r\nfrom them ourselves personally, although we lived two months in their\r\nhabitat, which was in this case as sharply defined as in many others,\r\nfor the south bank of the Chobe was infested by them, and the northern\r\nbank, where our cattle were placed, only fifty yards distant,\r\ncontained not a single specimen. This was the more remarkable, as we\r\noften saw natives carrying over raw meat to the opposite bank with\r\nmany Tsetses settled on it.\r\n\r\n\"The poison does not seem to be injected by a sting, or by ova placed\r\nbeneath the skin, for, when one is allowed to feed freely on the hand,\r\nit is seen to insert the middle prong of three portions, into which\r\nthe proboscis divides, somewhat deeply, into the true skin. It then\r\ndraws it out a little way, and it assumes a crimson colour, as the\r\nmandibles come into brisk operation. The previously-shrunken belly\r\nswells out, and, if left undisturbed, the fly quietly departs when it\r\nis full. A slight itching irritation follows, but not more than in the\r\nbite of the mosquito. In the ox this same bite produces no more\r\nimmediate effects than in man. It does not startle him, as the gad-fly\r\ndoes; but a few days afterwards the following symptoms supervene: the\r\neyes and nose begin to run, the coat stares as if the animal were\r\ncold, a swelling appears under the jaw, and sometimes on the navel;\r\nand, though the animal continues to graze, emaciation commences,\r\naccompanied with a peculiar flaccidity of the muscles, and this\r\nproceeds unchecked until, perhaps months afterwards, purging comes on,\r\nand the animal, no longer able to graze, perishes in the state of\r\nextreme exhaustion. Those which are in good condition often perish,\r\nsoon after the bite is inflicted, with staggering and blindness, as if\r\nthe brain were affected by it. Sudden changes of temperature produced\r\nby falls of rain seem to hasten the progress of the complaint; but in\r\ngeneral the emaciation goes on uninterruptedly for months, and, do\r\nwhat we will, the poor animals perish miserably.\r\n\r\n\"When opened, the cellular tissue on the surface of the body beneath\r\nthe skin is seen to be injected with air, as if a quantity of soap\r\nbubbles were scattered over it, or a dishonest awkward butcher had\r\nbeen trying to make it look fat. The fat is of a greenish-yellow\r\ncolour, and of an oily consistence. All the muscles are flabby, and\r\nthe heart often so soft that the fingers may be made to meet through\r\nit. The lungs and liver partake of the disease. The stomach and bowels\r\nare pale and empty, and the gall-bladder is distended with bile. These\r\nsymptoms seem to indicate, what is probably the case, a poison in the\r\nblood; the germ of which enters when the proboscis is inserted to draw\r\nblood. The poison-germ contained in a bulb at the root of the\r\nproboscis, seems capable, although very minute in quantity, of\r\nreproducing itself. The blood after death by Tsetse is very small in\r\nquantity, and scarcely stains the hands in dissection....\r\n\r\n\"The mule, ass, and goat enjoy the same immunity from the Tsetse as\r\nman and game. Many large tribes on the Zambesi can keep no domestic\r\nanimals except the goat, in consequence of the scourge existing in\r\ntheir country. Our children were frequently bitten, yet suffered no\r\nharm; and we saw around us numbers of zebras, buffaloes, pigs, pallahs\r\nand other antelopes, feeding quietly in the very habitat of the\r\nTsetse, yet as undisturbed by its bite as oxen are when they first\r\nreceive the fatal poison. There is not so much difference in the\r\nnatures of the horse and zebra, the buffalo and ox, the sheep and the\r\nantelope, as to afford any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.\r\nIs a man not as much a domestic animal as a dog?\r\n\r\n\"The curious feature in the case, that dogs perish though fed on milk,\r\nwhereas the calves escape so long as they continue sucking, made us\r\nimagine that the mischief might be produced by some plant in the\r\nlocality, and not by Tsetse; but Major Vardon, of the Madras army,\r\nsettled that point by riding a horse up to a small hill infested by\r\nthe insect, without allowing him time to graze, and though he only\r\nremained long enough to take a view of the country and catch some\r\nspecimens of Tsetse on the animal, in ten days afterwards the horse\r\nwas dead.\"[18]\r\n\r\n    [18] \"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa,\" by\r\n    David Livingstone, LL.D., D.C.L. P. 81, _et seq._ London, John\r\n    Murray, 1857. (The extract in the original of this work is from\r\n    a French translation: \"Explorations dans l'Intérieur de\r\n    l'Afrique australe, et voyages à travers le continent\r\n    Sainte-Paul de Loanda à l'Embouchure du Zambèze, de 1840 à\r\n    1846, traduit de l'Anglais.\" Pages 93-95. 8vo. Paris,\r\n    1859.--ED.)\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Zambesi can, therefore, have no domestic animal\r\nbut the goat. When herds of cattle driven by travellers or dealers are\r\nobliged to cross these regions, they only move them during the bright\r\nnights of the cool season, and are careful to smear them with dung\r\nmixed with milk; the Tsetse fly having an intense antipathy to the\r\ndung of animals, besides being in this season rendered dormant by the\r\nlowness of the temperature. It is only by such precautions that they\r\nare able to get through this dangerous stage of their journey.\r\n\r\nThe large blue Meat-fly, the familiar representative of the genus\r\n_Calliphora_, is known to all by its brilliant blue and white\r\nreflecting abdomen. This fly, which is common everywhere, is the\r\n_Calliphora vomitoria_ on which Réaumur has made many beautiful\r\nobservations, which we will make known to our readers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Eggs of the Meat-fly (_Calliphora vomitoria_).]\r\n\r\nIf we shut up a blue meat-fly in a glass vase, as Réaumur did, and\r\nplace near the insect a piece of fresh meat, before half a day is\r\npassed, the fly will have deposited its eggs thereon one after the\r\nother, in irregular heaps, of various sizes. The whole of these heaps\r\nconsist of about two hundred eggs, which are of an iridescent white\r\ncolour, and four or five times as long as they are broad. In less than\r\ntwenty-four hours after the egg is laid the larvæ is hatched. It is no\r\nsooner born than it thinks of feeding, and buries itself in the meat\r\nwith the aid of the hooks and lancets with which it is provided.\r\n\r\nThese worms do not appear to discharge any solid excrement, but they\r\nproduce a sticky liquid, which keeps the meat in a moist state and\r\nhastens its putrefaction. The larvæ eat voraciously and continually;\r\nso much so, that in four or five days they arrive at their full\r\ngrowth. They then take no more nourishment until they are transformed\r\ninto flies. They are now about to assume the pupa state. In this\r\ncondition it is no longer necessary for them to remain on the tainted\r\nmeat, which has been alike their cradle and their larder, and where\r\nuntil now they were so well off. They therefore leave it and seek a\r\nretreat under ground.\r\n\r\nThe larva then assumes a globular form and reddish colour, loses all\r\nmotion, and cannot any longer either lengthen or shorten, or dilate or\r\ncontract itself. Life seems to have left it. \"It would be considered a\r\nmiracle,\" says Réaumur, \"if we were told there was any kind of\r\nquadruped of the size of a bear, or of an ox, which at a certain time\r\nof the year, the beginning of winter for instance, disengages itself\r\ncompletely from its skin, of which it makes a box of an oval form;\r\nthat it shuts itself up in this box; that it knows how to close it in\r\nevery part, and besides that it knows how to strengthen it in such a\r\nmanner as to preserve itself from the effects of the air and the\r\nattacks of other animals. This prodigy is presented to us, on a small\r\nscale, in the metamorphosis of our larva. It casts its skin to make\r\nitself a strong and well-closed dwelling.\"\r\n\r\nIf one opens these cocoons only twenty-four hours after the\r\nmetamorphoses of the worms, no vestige of those parts appertaining to\r\na pupa is to be found. But four or five days afterwards, the cocoon is\r\noccupied by a white pupa, provided with all the parts of a fly. The\r\nlegs and wings, although enclosed in sheaths, are very distinct; these\r\nsheaths being so thin that they do not conceal them. The trunk of the\r\nfly rests on the thorax; one can discern its lips, and the case which\r\nencloses the lancet. The head is large and well formed, its large,\r\ncompound eyes being very distinct. The wings appear still unformed,\r\nbecause they are folded, and, as it were, packed up. It is a fly, but\r\nan immovable and inanimate fly; it is like a mummy enveloped in its\r\ncloths.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is intended this mummy should awake, and when the\r\ntime comes it will be strong and vigorous. Indeed, it has need of\r\nstrength and vigour to accomplish the important work of its life.\r\nAlthough its coverings are thin, it is a considerable work for the\r\ninsect to emerge, for each of its exterior parts is enclosed in them\r\nas in a case, much the same as a glove fits tightly to all the fingers\r\nof the hand. But that for which the most strength is necessary is the\r\noperation of forming the opening of the cocoon, in which as a mummy it\r\nis so tightly enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe fly always comes out at the same end of the cocoon, that is, at\r\nthe end where its head is placed, and also where the head of the larva\r\npreviously was. This end is composed of two parts--of two half cups\r\nplaced one against the other. These can be detached from each other\r\nand from the rest of the cocoon. It is sufficient for the fly that one\r\ncan be detached, and in order to effect this, it employs a most\r\nastonishing means. It expands and contracts its head alternately, as\r\nif by dilatation; and thus pushes the two half cups away from the end\r\nof the cocoon. This is not long able to resist the battering of the\r\nfly's head, and the insect at length comes out triumphant. This fly,\r\nwhich should be blue, is then grey; it, however, comes quickly to\r\nperfection, at the end of three hours attaining its ultimate colour;\r\nand in a very short space of time every part of the animal becomes of\r\nthat firmness and consistency which characterises them. At the same\r\ntime, the wings, which at the moment it came into the world were only\r\nstumps, extend and unfold themselves by degrees. The meat-fly is\r\nrepresented below (Fig. 55).\r\n\r\nOne of the features in the formation of this fly which most attracted\r\nthe attention of Réaumur, and which is likely to excite the curiosity\r\nof all those who take an interest in insects, is the composition of\r\nits trunk. We will, therefore, with that illustrious observer, take a\r\nglimpse at the remarkable and complicated apparatus by the aid of\r\nwhich the fly can suck up liquids, and can even taste solid and\r\ncrystalline substances, such as sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Blue-bottle fly (_Calliphora vomitoria_),\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nIt is no difficult matter to make a fly show its trunk extended to its\r\nfull extent. One has only to press between the finger and thumb either\r\nthe two sides of the upper and under part of the thorax. It is thus\r\nforced at once to put out its tongue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Trunk of the Meat-fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Conical part of the trunk.]\r\n\r\nThe trunk appears to be composed of two parts joined together, and\r\nforming a more or less obtuse angle (Fig. 56). The first portion of\r\nthe trunk, that which joins the head, is perfectly membranous and in\r\nthe form of a funnel. We will call it the conical part, and show it\r\nseparately (Fig. 57). The second portion terminates in a thick mass,\r\nin part cartilaginous or scaly, and of a shiny brown colour. Above\r\nthe conical portion are two oblong antennæ, without joints, of\r\nchestnut colour, and furnished with hairs.\r\n\r\nOn ceasing to press the thorax, the membranous conical portion may be\r\nseen to draw itself back within its sheath (Fig. 58). The second\r\nportion is at the same time drawn into the cavity, but it raises\r\nitself by forming a more and more acute angle, so that when it reaches\r\nthe opening of the cell it is parallel with, and its length is equal\r\nto that of the cell, which is quite large enough to receive it. The\r\nbase lengthens and flattens a little, and conceals the trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Retractile proboscis of Blue-bottle fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Extremity on the proboscis of a fly.]\r\n\r\nLet us cause the trunk to extend itself a second time, in order to\r\nobserve its tip minutely. Here the opening is placed, which may be\r\nlooked upon as the mouth of the insect, and is provided with two large\r\nthick lips (Fig. 59). These lips form a disc, perpendicular to the\r\naxis of the trunk; the disc is oval, and is divided into two equal and\r\nsimilar parts by a slit. The lips have each a considerable number of\r\nparallel channels situated perpendicularly to the slit. These channels\r\nare formed by a succession of vessels placed near each other. On\r\npressing the trunk we see that these vessels are distended by a\r\nliquid. Réaumur, from whom we borrow these details, discovered a few\r\nof the uses to which this trunk is applied. He covered the interior of\r\na transparent glass vase with a light coat of thick syrup. He then put\r\nin some flies, when it was easy to see some of them proceed to fix\r\nthemselves to the sides of the vase, and regale themselves on the\r\nsugary liquid, of which they are very fond. He observed them\r\ncarefully, and in his admirable work he recommends those who are\r\ncurious to try the experiment, with which, like himself, they will\r\ncertainly be satisfied.\r\n\r\nWhile the body of the trunk is stationary its end is much agitated. It\r\nmay be seen to move in different ways, and with an astonishing\r\nquickness; the lips acting in a hundred different ways, and always\r\nwith great rapidity. The small diameter of the disc which they form\r\nlengthens and shortens alternately; the angle formed by the two lips\r\nvaries every instant; they become successively flat and convex, either\r\nentirely or partly. All these movements, Réaumur remarks, give a high\r\nidea of the organisation of the part which performs them.\r\n\r\nThe object of all these movements is to draw the syrup into the\r\ninterior of the trunk. If we observe the lips (Fig. 60) attentively,\r\nit will easily be seen that they touch each other about the centre of\r\nthe disc, and leave two openings, one in front, the other at the back.\r\nThe one in front is, one may say, the mouth of the fly, as it is to\r\nthis opening that the liquid is brought, which is intended to be and\r\nis soon introduced into the trunk. Without occupying ourselves for the\r\npresent with the channel through which it rises, we may first ask,\r\nwhatever that channel may be, what is the power that forces the liquid\r\ninto it?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Lips of the proboscis of a fly.]\r\n\r\nIt is nearly certain that suction is the principal cause of the liquid\r\nflowing up the trunk. It would thus be a sort of pump, into which the\r\nliquid is forced by the pressure of the external air. The fly exhausts\r\nthe air from the tube of its trunk, and the drop of liquid which is at\r\nthe opening penetrates and goes up this channel through the influence\r\nof the atmospheric pressure. To this physical phenomenon must be added\r\nthe numerous and multiplied movements which take place in the trunk,\r\nand which are intended to cause sufficient pressure to drive the\r\nliquor which is introduced into the channel upwards.\r\n\r\nRéaumur wished to know how it was that very thick syrups, and even\r\nsolid sugar, can be sucked up by the soft trunk of the fly. What he\r\nsaw is wonderful. If a fly meets with too thick a syrup, it can render\r\nit sufficiently liquid; if the sugar is too hard, it can dissolve\r\nsmall portions of it. In fact, there exists in its body a supply of\r\nliquid, of which it discharges a drop from the end of its trunk at\r\nwill, and lets this fall on the sugar which it wishes to dissolve, or\r\non the syrup it wishes to dilute. A fly, when held between the\r\nfingers, often shows at the end of its trunk a drop, very fluid and\r\ntransparent, of this liquid. \"The water poured on the syrup,\" says\r\nRéaumur, \"would not always insinuate itself sufficiently quick into\r\nevery part of it; the movement of the fly's lips hastens the\r\noperation; the lips turn over, work, and knead it, so that the water\r\ncan quickly penetrate it, in the same way as one handles and kneads\r\nwith one's hands a hard paste which it is wished to soften, by causing\r\nthe water by which it is covered to mix with it. This, again, is the\r\nsame means the fly employs with sugar. When the trunk is forced to\r\nact upon a grain of irregular and rugged form, on which it cannot\r\neasily fasten, its end distorts itself to seize and hold it. It is\r\nsometimes very amusing to see how the fly turns over the grain of\r\nsugar in different ways; it appears to play with it as a monkey would\r\nwith an apple. It is, however, only that it may hold it well in order\r\nto moisten it more successfully, and afterwards to pump up the water\r\nwhich has partly dissolved it.\"\r\n\r\nRéaumur often observed a drop of water at the end of the trunks of\r\nflies which were perfectly surfeited with food. This drop ascended the\r\ntrunk, then re-descended to the end, and this many times in\r\nsuccession. It appeared to him that it was necessary for these\r\ninsects, as for many quadrupeds, to chew the cud, as it were; that, in\r\norder the better to digest the liquid they had passed into their\r\nstomachs, they were obliged to bring it back into the trunk that it\r\nmight return again better prepared.\r\n\r\nIn order to assure himself directly of the reality of his supposition,\r\nRéaumur tested the water which a fly, that he says \"had got drunk on\r\nsugar,\" had brought back to the end of its trunk; he found this to be\r\nsugar and water. Also, having given a fly currant-jelly, he observed,\r\nafter it had sufficiently gorged itself, several drops of red liquid\r\nin its trunk, and having tasted it, found it had the flavour which,\r\nfrom its appearance, he guessed it would have.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious observer, who had already made all these discoveries\r\non the formation and functions of the trunks of insects, often\r\nreflected on the fact that the liquors of which flies are most fond\r\nare enclosed under the skin of certain fruits, such as pears, plums,\r\ngrapes, &c., or even under the skin of some animals of which they suck\r\nthe blood. In order that the trunk of a fly may act under such\r\ncircumstances, it is necessary for it to pierce and open the skin. If\r\nthis is the case, flies ought to be possessed of a lancet. He looked a\r\nlong time for this lancet, and at last found it. It is situated on the\r\nupper side of the part of the trunk which is terminated by the lips;\r\nit is placed in a fleshy groove, and is enclosed in a case. It has a\r\nvery fine point, and is of light colour (Fig. 61). The point is\r\nsituated in the opening which is to be seen between the lips of the\r\ntrunk, at its anterior end, through which liquids may pass. That is\r\nthe only opening of the lips; and the sucker which takes up the liquid\r\nis the same part which we just now called the case of the lancet.\r\n\r\nRéaumur is so interesting an author that it is difficult to cease\r\nquoting him; but we must continue our review of the principal kinds of\r\nDiptera.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Musca_ (fly), in which Linnæus comprised the immense series\r\nof Diptera, with the exception of the _Tipulidæ_, the _Tabanidæ_, the\r\n_Asilidæ_, the _Bombylidæ_, and the _Empidæ_, is now reduced to the\r\nHouse Fly and a few resembling it. The habits of these troublesome\r\ncompanions are in conformity with the two great principles of animal\r\nlife, that is, eating and propagating their species.\r\n\r\nFlies feed principally on fluids which exude from the bodies of\r\nanimals; that is, sweat, saliva, and other secretions. They also seek\r\nvegetable juices; and they may be seen in our houses to feed eagerly\r\non fruits and sweet substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Lancet of the Meat Fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--House Fly (_Musca domestica_).]\r\n\r\nThe common flies deposit their eggs on vegetables, and particularly on\r\nfungi in a state of decomposition, on dung-heaps, cow dung, &c. They\r\nare essentially parasites, settling on both man and beast, to suck up\r\nthe fluid substances which are diffused over the surface of their\r\nbodies. In our dwellings they eat anything that will serve to nourish\r\nthem. Generation succeeds generation with the greatest rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe House Fly (_Musca domestica_, Fig. 62) is about three lines in\r\nlength, ash coloured, with the face black, the sides of the head\r\nyellow, and the forehead yellow with black stripes; the thorax is\r\nmarked with black lines; the abdomen is pale underneath, and a\r\ntransparent yellow at the sides, in the males, and is speckled with\r\nblack. The feet are black; the wings transparent, and yellowish at the\r\nbase. This species is extremely plentiful throughout the whole of\r\nEurope. Every one knows how annoying it is towards the end of the\r\nsummer, and especially so in the South of France during the hot\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe Ox Fly (_Musca bovina_), a near relation of the house fly, is also\r\nvery common. It settles on the nostrils, the eyes, and the wounds of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe Executioner Fly (_Musca carnifex_), which is not rare in France,\r\nalso attacks oxen. It is of a dark metallic green colour with a\r\nslight ash-coloured down. Its forehead is silvery at the front and\r\nsides; the abdomen is edged with black; the wings hyaline, and yellow\r\nat the base.\r\n\r\n_Section of the Anthomyides._--The section of _Anthomyides_ comprises\r\ninsects which appear to be _Creophili_ whose organisation has become\r\nweakened by almost insensible degrees. Their colours vary very\r\nmuch--black, grey, and iron-colour are everlastingly shaded and\r\nblended together. To that may be added reflections which are above the\r\nground colour, and which change the hues of the little animal\r\naccording to the incidence of the rays of light. The _Anthomyides_\r\nresemble the genus _Musca_ very closely in their habits as well as in\r\ntheir organisation.\r\n\r\nIn this group of Diptera we will first say a few words about the\r\n_Anthomiæ_. These flies are to be found in most gardens, and on all\r\nflowers, particularly on the heads of Compositæ and Umbelliferæ. They\r\noften unite in numerous bands in the air, and indulge in the joyous\r\ndances to which love invites them. The females deposit their eggs in\r\nthe ground, and their larvæ are there quickly developed. The latter\r\nsuspend themselves to certain bodies, the same as some lepidopterous\r\nchrysalides, in order to transform themselves into pupæ.\r\n\r\nThe _Anthomyia pluvialis_ (Fig. 63) is from two to four lines in\r\nlength, and of a whitish ash-colour. Its wings are hyaline, the thorax\r\nhas five black spots, and the abdomen three rows of similar spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Anthomyia pluvialis.]\r\n\r\nWe will stop a moment with the _Pegomyiæ_, which are very interesting\r\nin the larva state, and which excited the interest and sagacity of\r\nRéaumur.\r\n\r\nThe cradle of these Diptera is the interior of leaves. They work as\r\nthe miners of the vegetable world, in the parenchyma or cellular\r\ntissue of the leaf, between the two epidermal membranes. The henbane,\r\nthe sorrel, and the thistle, especially nourish them. If one holds a\r\nleaf in which one of these miners has established itself against the\r\nlight, one sees the workman boring the vegetable membrane. Its head is\r\narmed with a hook, formed of two horny pieces, and with this hook it\r\ndigs into the parenchyma of the leaf. The effect of this digging is\r\nvisible, as those places become by degrees transparent. Each blow\r\ndetaches a small portion of the substance of the leaf. It is thus that\r\nthese miners hollow out galleries for themselves, in which they find\r\nshelter, food, and security. Some are changed into pupæ in the gallery\r\nwhich they have hollowed out, others go out of the leaves when they\r\nare near their final transformation.\r\n\r\n_Section of Acalyptera._--The _Acalyptera_, which are the last of the\r\ngreat tribe of _Muscidæ_, comprehend the greater number of these\r\ninsects. Their constitution appears to be peculiar and slow. They live\r\nprincipally in the thickest part of woods, on grasses, and aquatic\r\nplants. Fearing the lustre and warmth of the sun, they never draw the\r\nnectar from flowers. Their flight is feeble, and they never indulge in\r\nthose joyous ethereal dances which we have mentioned when speaking of\r\nthe preceding groups. Their life is generally melancholy, obscure, and\r\nhidden. Some of them seek decomposed animal and vegetable substances,\r\nothers living vegetables.\r\n\r\nWe shall only be able in this immense group of _Muscidæ_ to mention a\r\nfew types which are interesting from various reasons, such as the\r\n_Helomyzæ_, the _Scatophagæ_, the _Ortalides_, the _Daci_, and the\r\n_Thyreophoræ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--A species of Helomyza.]\r\n\r\nThe _Helomyzæ_ (Fig. 64) live in the woods. Their larvæ are developed\r\nin the interior of fungi. Réaumur studied the larvæ of the Truffle\r\nHelomyza. The head of this fly is ferruginous, its thorax is of a\r\nbrownish grey, its shoulders of a brownish yellow, its wings brownish,\r\nthe abdomen yellow and brown, and the feet red. The larvæ of these\r\ninsects commit depredations for which gourmands will never forgive\r\nthem, destroying, as they do, their truffles. When one presses between\r\none's fingers a truffle that is in a too advanced state, one feels\r\ncertain soft parts, which yield under pressure. On opening the\r\ntruffle, the larvæ of the insect of which we are speaking will be\r\nfound inside. These larvæ are white and very transparent. Their mouth\r\nis armed with two black hooks, by means of which they dig into the\r\ntruffle in the same way as other larvæ dig into meat. The excretions\r\nof these little parasites cause the truffle to become decomposed and\r\nrotten. In a few days the larvæ become full-grown. They then leave\r\ntheir abode and go into the ground, there to change into pupæ.\r\n\r\nThe _Ortalidæ_ form a tribe which is remarkable for the upright\r\ncarriage of the wings, which are generally speckled, by the vibratory\r\nmovement of these organs, and especially for the cradle chosen by them\r\nfor their progeny in fruits and grains. Nature seems to have assigned\r\nto each species its own particular vegetable.\r\n\r\nWe will only mention here the Cherry-tree _Ortalis_, whose larva lives\r\non the pulp of that fruit. This fly is about a line and a half long.\r\nIt is of rather a metallic black colour, its head light yellow, the\r\nedges of its eyes white, and the tarsi red. The wings have four broad\r\nblack stripes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Dacus oleæ.]\r\n\r\nThe Olive Dacus (_Dacus oleæ_, Fig. 65) is a little fly, about half\r\nthe size of the house fly, of ashy grey colour on the back, its head\r\norange-yellow, its eyes green, and its forehead yellow, marked with\r\ntwo large black spots. The thorax is adorned with four lightish yellow\r\nspots, and its hind part, as well as its antennæ and wings, are of the\r\nsame colour. The wings are transparent, reflecting green, gold, pink,\r\nand blue, according as the rays of light fall upon them, and are\r\nremarkable for having a small black spot at their extremity. The\r\nabdomen is of a fawn colour or orange-yellow, spotted with black on\r\neach side. This fly performs sudden and jerking movements; it keeps\r\nits wings extended, and rather jumps than flies. It is a destructive\r\ninsect, a perfect scourge, which causes every two or three years a\r\nloss of five or six millions of francs to French agriculture.\r\n\r\nM. Guérin-Méneville has made some valuable observations on the Olive\r\nDacus, and at the request of the Imperial Society of Agriculture of\r\nParis, has indicated the way to preserve the olive from these ruinous\r\nlarvæ, which generally destroy two crops out of three. We will borrow\r\nthe following details from this learned entomologist: \"At the time\r\nwhen the olives are formed the Dacus proceeds to place an egg under\r\nthe skin of each of the fruits. By means of a little horny instrument,\r\nwith which the female is provided, and which contains a small lancet,\r\nshe pierces the skin of the olive; she moves her wings and lays her\r\negg. She afterwards cleans and rests herself, by passing her feet over\r\nher head, wings, and other parts of her body. She then flies away, and\r\nseeks another olive, to deposit in it another egg; she repeats this\r\noperation until she has placed on as many olives the three or four\r\nhundred eggs which she bears.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Olives attacked by Dacus oleæ.]\r\n\r\nFig. 66, taken from the Memoir published by M. Guérin-Méneville, in\r\nthe \"Revue Nouvelle\" of the 15th July, 1847, shows the Dacus laying\r\nits eggs on the olive, and the larvæ that are already hatched in\r\nanother of the same fruit. The larvæ which succeed these eggs (Fig.\r\n67) are whitish, soft, and without limbs. They pass fifteen or sixteen\r\ndays in boring a gallery in the pulp of the olive, at first\r\nvertically, until they reach the stone, then on one side, and along\r\nthe side of the stone. When they have reached the term of their\r\ndevelopment, they approach the surface, enlarging the first channel\r\nand leaving between it and the exterior air only a thin pellicle, in\r\nthe middle of which may be perceived the first small opening by which\r\nthe mother had introduced her egg in the commencement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Larvæ of Dacus oleæ (magnified and natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Gallery formed by larva of Dacus oleæ.]\r\n\r\nFig. 68, copied from a drawing in the Memoirs of M. Guérin-Méneville,\r\nshows the gallery bored round the olive by the larva of the Dacus. The\r\nlarva thus prepares an easy issue for the perfect insect. Its skin\r\nthen contracts, its body diminishes in length, and is transformed into\r\nan oval cocoon, which soon gets brown, and is the chrysalis of the\r\ninsect. At the side of the head it shows a curved line, a thin suture\r\nwhich marks a sort of cap or door, which, at the time of its hatching,\r\nthe insect will be easily able to force open with its head. The fly is\r\nhatched twelve days after its metamorphosis from the larva to the\r\npupa. It has thus taken the Dacus twenty-seven to twenty-eight days to\r\narrive at this state, from the time the egg was laid; besides which,\r\nthis species, in the warm climates of Provence and Italy, can\r\nreproduce itself several times from the beginning of July, the period\r\nat which the first flies begin to lay, till the end of autumn.\r\n\r\nIn order to save a considerable portion of the olive crop of these\r\ncountries, M. Guérin-Méneville has advised hastening the harvest\r\nsufficiently for all the olives to be pressed at a time when the larvæ\r\nof the last generation, which would be preserved in the olives that\r\nare left, or in the earth, according to the climate, are still in the\r\nfruit. If a first operation were not sufficient to destroy them all,\r\nit should be repeated the following year. The sacrifice entailed by\r\nthis practice would be amply compensated by a succession of good crops\r\nand the certainty of a sure and permanent profit. In fact, by an early\r\ngathering at least half a crop of oil is still obtained; whereas, by\r\nwaiting for the usual period of gathering the olives, sufficient time\r\nis left for the larvæ of the Dacus to devour their parenchyma, which\r\ndeprives them of the little oil that they might have yielded if their\r\ndestruction had been accomplished earlier. This early gathering has\r\nthe advantage of causing the destruction of a great number of larvæ,\r\nwhich will be so much towards diminishing the means of reproduction of\r\nthe fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hemiptera are particularly distinguished from other kinds of\r\ninsects by the form of their mouth, which consists of a beak, more or\r\nless long, composed of six parts: that is, of a lower lip, or sheath;\r\nfour internal threads, representing the mandibles and jaws of the\r\ngrinding insects, and which are the perforating parts of the beaks;\r\nand, lastly, of the upper lip or labrum. Owing to this apparatus,\r\nthese insects are essentially sucking ones, and chiefly nourish\r\nthemselves with the juices of vegetables, which they draw up with\r\ntheir beak. The wings of the Hemiptera are usually four in number; in\r\nsome species they are membranous and similar to each other, and in\r\nothers the upper are of rather harder consistency than the lower ones.\r\nIn general, the former are quite different from the lower wings, and\r\nare only membranous at the tip, whereas the other part is thick,\r\ntough, and coriaceous.\r\n\r\nThe Hemiptera are divided into two very distinct sections. The one is\r\ncomposed of insects whose beak grows from the forehead or upper part\r\nof the head, and whose anterior wings are half coriaceous and half\r\nmembranous, having the base of a different texture from the extremity:\r\nthese are the Heteroptera ([Greek: heteros], different; [Greek:\r\npteron], wing). The other section is composed of those whose beak\r\ngrows from the lower part of the head, and whose anterior wings are\r\nalways of the same consistency throughout: these are the Homoptera\r\n([Greek: homos], the same; [Greek: pteron], wing). We are about to\r\ngive the history of these two sub-orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nHETEROPTERA.\r\n\r\nThe insects formerly known by the general name of Bugs have been\r\ndivided by Latreille into two large families, containing: the one the\r\n_Geocorisæ_,[19] or Land Bugs; the other the _Hydrocorisæ_,[20] or\r\nWater Bugs.\r\n\r\n    [19] From [Greek: gê], the earth, and [Greek: koris], a bug.\r\n\r\n    [20] From [Greek: hydôr], water, and [Greek: koris], a bug.\r\n\r\nThe land bugs consist of a great number of kinds, which, for the\r\nmost part, are of little interest. We will only mention here the\r\n_Peniatomidæ_, commonly known as Wood Bugs; the _Lygæi_, Bugs,\r\nproperly so called; the _Reduvii_, and the _Hydrometræ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Pentatomidæ_, which comprise many genera, include the wood bugs\r\nof most authors. They are to be found on plants and trees. They fly\r\nquickly, but only for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe Ornamented Pentatoma (_Strachia_ [_Pentatoma_] _ornata_), known\r\nas the Red Cabbage Bug, is very commonly found on the cabbage, and\r\non most of the cruciferous plants. It is variegated with red and\r\nblack, and its colours are subject to numerous variations. The Grey\r\nPentatoma (_Raphigaster griseus_), Fig. 69, is common throughout the\r\nwhole of Europe. In autumn these bugs are frequently to be found on\r\nraspberries, to which they impart their disagreeable smell. They are\r\nalso to be found in quantities on the mullein, when that plant is in\r\nflower. The upper parts of the head are of a greyish brown, and are\r\nsometimes slightly purple. The coriaceous part of the hemelytra\r\nis of a purple tint, but the membranous part is brown. All these\r\nparts are covered with black spots, which are only to be seen with\r\na magnifying-glass. The wings are blackish. The under part of the\r\nwhole body and the feet are of a light and rather yellowish grey, with\r\na considerable number of small black spots. The abdomen is black above;\r\nand it is bordered with alternate black and white spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Grey Pentatoma (_Raphigaster griseus_).]\r\n\r\nWe have repeated here the description given of this bug by the\r\nillustrious Swedish naturalist, De Geer, because our young readers\r\nhave most likely met with this insect, or will do so some day when\r\ngathering raspberries.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Pentatoma, marked with black, yellow, and red, is to be found\r\nthroughout the whole of Europe in cultivated fields and gardens,\r\nsometimes also on the trunks of large trees, especially elms. This\r\nspecies, in common with the greater part of those which compose the\r\ngroup we are describing, emits a smell when irritated or menaced by\r\nsome danger. At other times no odour will be noticed. Let us hear what\r\nM. Léon Dufour says on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Seize the Pentatoma with a pair of pincers and plunge it into a glass\r\nof clear water; look through a magnifying-glass, and you will see\r\ninnumerable small globules arising from its body, which, bursting on\r\nthe surface of the water, exhale that odour which is so disagreeable.\r\nThis vapour, which is essentially acrid, if it happens to touch the\r\neyes, causes a considerable amount of irritation. If one of these\r\ninsects is held between the fingers, so as not to stop up the\r\nodoriferous orifices, and to cause this vapour to touch a part of the\r\nskin, a spot, either brown or livid, will ensue on that part, which\r\nlotions, though repeatedly applied, will at first fail to remove, and\r\nwhich produces in the cutaneous tissue an alteration similar to that\r\nwhich succeeds the application of mineral acids.\"\r\n\r\nThe disagreeable smell exhaled by different species of Pentatoma is\r\nthe result of a fluid secreted by a single pear-shaped gland, either\r\nred or yellow, which occupies the centre of the thorax, and which\r\nterminates between the hind legs.\r\n\r\nWith the _Syromastes_, which are bugs of this same section, the\r\nsecretion has, on the contrary, an agreeable smell, which reminds one\r\nof that of apples. Many kinds of Pentatoma are destructive to\r\nagriculture. Others, however, attack the destructive insects, and\r\nought therefore to be carefully spared. We will mention in this case\r\nthe Blue Pentatoma, which kills the _Altica_[21] of the vine.\r\n\r\n    [21] This species is _Lygænus militaris_.--ED.\r\n\r\nThere may be observed, at the foot and about the lower part of trees,\r\nor at the base of walls exposed to the mid-day sun, groups of fifty or\r\nsixty small insects pressed close to each other, and often one on the\r\ntop of the other, their heads in the direction of a centre point. They\r\nare red, spotted with black. In the neighbourhood of Paris the\r\nchildren call them \"_Suisses_,\" probably on account of the red on\r\ntheir bodies, that being the colour of the uniform of the Swiss troops\r\nformerly in the service of France. In Burgundy the children call them\r\n\"_petits cochons rouges_.\" They will be found described in Geoffroy's\r\n\"Histoire des Insectes,\" under the name of the Red Garden Bug. At the\r\npresent day they are placed in the genus _Lygæus_.[22] When the bad\r\nweather comes, these little \"_Suisses_\" take refuge under stones and\r\nthe bark of trees to pass the winter. During the whole of that season\r\nthey remain in a sort of torpid state. But in the first days of spring\r\nthey revive, and resume their ordinary habits. They suck the sap of\r\nvegetables, piercing the capsules of divers kinds of mallows, and\r\nalways keeping in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n    [22] A genus of beetles.\r\n\r\nThe Bug, popularly so called, or Bed Bug (_Acanthia lectularia_, or\r\n_Cimex lectularius_, Fig. 70), a most disagreeable and stinking\r\ninsect, abounds in dirty houses, principally in towns, and above all\r\nin those of warm countries. It lives in beds, in wood-work, and\r\npaper-hangings. There is no crack, however narrow it may be, into\r\nwhich it is unable to slip. It is nocturnal, shunning the light.\r\n\"Nocturnum foetidum animal,\" says Linnæus. Its body is oval, about\r\nthe fifth of an inch in length, flat, soft, of a brown colour, and\r\ncovered with little hairs. Its head is provided with two hairy\r\nantennæ, and two round black eyes, and has a short beak, curved\r\ndirectly under its thorax, and lying in a shallow groove when the\r\nanimal is at rest. This beak, composed of three joints, contains four\r\nthin, straight, and sharp hairs. The thorax is dilated at the sides.\r\nThe abdomen is very much developed, orbicular, composed of eight\r\nsegments, very much depressed, and easily crushed by the fingers. The\r\nhemelytra are rudimentary. It has no membranous wings. The tarsi have\r\nthree articulations, of which the last is provided with two strong\r\nhooks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Bed Bug (_Acanthia lectularia_), magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Egg of Bug, magnified.]\r\n\r\n\"These animals,\" says Moquin-Tandon, in his \"Zoologie Médicale,\" \"do\r\nnot draw up the sanguineous fluid by suction, properly so-called, as\r\nleeches do. The organisation of their buccal apparatus does not allow\r\nof this. The hairs of the beak applied the one against the other\r\nexercise a sort of alternate motion, which draws the blood up into the\r\noesophagus, very much in the same manner as water rises in a chain\r\npump. This rising is assisted by the viscous nature of the fluid, and\r\nabove all, by the globules it contains.\" The part of the skin which\r\nthe Bug has pierced, producing a painful sensation, is easily\r\nrecognised by a little reddish mark, presenting in its centre a dark\r\nspot. Generally a little blister rises on the point pierced, and\r\nsometimes, if the Bug-bites are numerous, these blisters become\r\nconfluent, and resemble a sort of eruption. These disgusting insects\r\nlay, towards the month of May, oblong whitish eggs (Fig. 71), having a\r\nsmall aperture, through which the larva comes out. The larva differs\r\nfrom the insect in its perfect state, in its colour, which is pale or\r\nyellowish. This insect exists in nearly the whole of Europe, although\r\nit is rare or almost unknown in the northern parts. The towns of\r\ncentral Europe are the most infested by this parasite, but those of\r\nthe north are not completely free from its presence. The Marquis de\r\nCustine assures us that at St. Petersburg he found them numerous. It\r\nis found also in Scotland; is very rare in the south of Europe; and\r\nseldom seen in Italy, where it is, however, replaced by other insects\r\nmore dangerous or more annoying.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Bug was brought into Europe from America;\r\nbut Aristotle, Pliny, and Dioscorides mention its existence. It is\r\ncertain that it was unknown in England till the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century. A celebrated traveller, a Spanish naturalist,\r\nAzara, has remarked that the Bug does not infest man in his savage\r\nstate, but only when congregated together in a state of civilisation,\r\nand in houses, as in Europe. From this he concluded that the Bug was\r\nnot created till long after man, when, after many centuries had\r\nelapsed since his appearance on the globe, men formed themselves into\r\nsocieties, into republics, or little states.\r\n\r\nThe bug is not a gluttonous insect, always bloodthirsty; on the\r\ncontrary, its sobriety is remarkable. It is only after a prolonged\r\nfast that it bites animals; and Audouin has stated that it can live a\r\nyear and even two years without food.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial a number of different means have been employed\r\nfor destroying these insects; but in spite of all, nothing is more\r\ndifficult than to get rid of them from wood-work and paper-hangings,\r\nwhen they have once infested them. In general, strong odours cause\r\ntheir death. And so, to rid oneself of these disagreeable guests, it\r\nhas been recommended to use tobacco smoke, essence of turpentine, the\r\nfumes of sulphur, &c. Mercurial ointment and corrosive sublimate are\r\nalso excellent means for their destruction; and for the same purpose\r\nthe merits of a plant belonging to the order Cruciferæ, _Lepidium\r\nruderale_, have been much vaunted; and more recently still, the root\r\nof the Pyrethrum, a species of camomile, reduced to powder, and blown\r\ninto the furniture or wood-work. This powder is known and employed at\r\nParis under the name of \"_poudre insecticide_.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two other kinds of bugs (_Acanthia_) which attack men. The\r\none is the _Acanthia ciliata_, which has been found in the houses of\r\nKazan, and which differs from the bed bug not only in its form, but\r\nalso in its habits. It does not live in companies, in the narrow\r\ncracks of furniture, but moves about alone, at a slow pace, over walls\r\nor the counterpanes of beds. Its beak is very long, and its bite is\r\nvery painful, and produces obstinate swellings.\r\n\r\nThe other species is the _Acanthia rotundata_, which is found in the\r\nIsland of La Réunion, and attacks men in the same way as does the\r\nEuropean bug. Two species of the same genus live as parasites on\r\nswallows and domestic pigeons. There is another species, which is\r\npeculiar to the bats of our climates.\r\n\r\nThe _Reduvius personatus_, called also Fly Bug, by Geoffroy, the old\r\nhistorian of the insects of the environs of Paris, is common enough\r\nin France. It keeps to the houses, and is found especially near ovens\r\nand chimney-pieces. It is about three-quarters of an inch in length,\r\noblong, flat on its upper side, brownish, has horizontal hemelytra\r\ncrossed over each other, and very fully developed wings, which serve\r\nfor flight. Its head, narrow, supported by a well-defined neck, is\r\nprovided with two composite and two simple eyes. It requires, no\r\ndoubt, to see very clearly, as it flies by night. It should not be\r\ncaught without great caution. If you desire to examine it closely,\r\nwhen, in the hottest part of the summer, it comes in the evening and\r\nflutters round the lights, you must be careful how you seize it, for\r\nit wounds. The wounds inflicted by it are very painful--more painful\r\nthan those of the bee--and they immediately cause a numbness.\r\n\r\nAs the _Reduvius_ kills different insects very rapidly, by piercing\r\nthem with its long beak, it is probable that it secretes some kind of\r\nvenom. But as yet the organ that produces this poison has not been\r\ndiscovered. However that may be, its beak is curved, and about the\r\ntenth of an inch long, the surface bristling with hairs. It is\r\ncomposed of three joints, and contains four stiff, lanceolate, and\r\nvery pointed squamose hairs.\r\n\r\nThis insect often seeks its prey in places where spiders spin their\r\nwebs. When they walk on, or are caught in, the spiders' webs, the\r\nspiders take care not to seize them, for they fear their beak. They\r\nprudently allow them to struggle about the nets, where they very soon\r\ndie of hunger. The _Reduvius_ is often seen, either a prisoner or\r\ndead, in the midst of a spider's web.\r\n\r\n\"This bug,\" says Charles de Geer, \"has, in the pupal condition, or\r\nbefore its wings are developed, an appearance altogether hideous and\r\nrevolting. One would take it, at the first glance, for one of the\r\nugliest of spiders. That which above all renders it so disagreeable to\r\nthe sight is that it is entirely covered, and, as it were, enveloped\r\nwith a greyish matter, which is nothing else but the dust which one\r\nsees in the corners of badly-swept rooms, and which is generally mixed\r\nwith sand and particles of wool, or silk, or other similar matters\r\nwhich come from furniture and clothes, rendering the legs of this\r\ninsect thick and deformed, and giving to its whole body a very\r\nsingular appearance.\"\r\n\r\nWhat instincts! what habits! Under this borrowed costume, under this\r\ncloak, which is no part of itself, the insect, as it were, masked, has\r\nbecome twice its real size. What becomes of its disguise, and how does\r\nit manage to walk? Of what use to it is this dirty and grotesque fancy\r\ndress?\r\n\r\nLet us listen to De Geer. \"It walks as fast, when it likes, as other\r\nbugs; but generally its walk is slow, and it moves with measured\r\nsteps. After having taken one step forward, it stops a while, and then\r\ntakes another, leaving, at each movement, the opposite leg in repose;\r\nit goes on thus continually, step after step in succession, which\r\ngives it the appearance of walking as if by jerks, and in measure. It\r\nmakes almost the same sort of movement with its antennæ, which it\r\nmoves also at intervals and by jerks. All these movements have a more\r\nsingular appearance than it is possible for us to describe.\"[23]\r\n\r\n    [23] \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes.\" Tome\r\n    iii., p. 283. 4to. Stockholm, 1773.\r\n\r\nBy means of this disguise, it can approach little animals, which\r\nbecome its prey, such as flies, spiders, bed bugs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--Pupa of Reduvius personatus, covered with its\r\ncloak of dust (magnified).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Pupa of Reduvius personatus, denuded of its\r\ncloak of dust (magnified).]\r\n\r\nTo see what a curious appearance the _Reduvius_ presents, one should\r\ntake off its borrowed costume. Then you will observe an entirely\r\ndifferent animal, and one which has nothing repulsive about it. With\r\nthe exception of the hemelytra and wings, which it has not yet got,\r\nall its parts have the form which they are to have later, after the\r\nwings are developed.\r\n\r\nFig. 72 represents, from Charles de Geer's Memoir, the pupa of the\r\n_Reduvius personatus_ covered with dust, and resembling a spider; Fig.\r\n73 the same insect cleaned, freed from the cloak of dust which served\r\nto disguise it.\r\n\r\nThe _Hydrometræ_ (from [Greek: hydôr], water, and [Greek: metrein], to\r\nmeasure) have linear bodies. The head, which forms nearly the third\r\nof the entire length, is furnished with two long antennæ, and armed\r\nwith a thin, hair-like beak. The legs are long, and of equal length.\r\nThe reader may have often seen the _Hydrometra stagnorum_ walking by\r\njerks on the surface of the water (Fig. 74). The body and legs are of\r\na ferruginous colour, the hemelytra a dull brown, and the wings\r\nhyaline, or glassy, and slightly blackish. Geoffroy says that it\r\nresembles a long needle, and calls it the Needle Bug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Hydrometra stagnorum.]\r\n\r\nThe _Hydrocorisæ_, or Water Bugs, have the antennæ shorter than the\r\nhead, or scarcely attaining to its length, and inserted and hidden\r\nunder the eyes, which are in general of remarkable size. All these\r\nHemiptera are aquatic and carnivorous. We will mention the two\r\nprincipal types, the _Nepæ_, or Water Scorpions, and the _Notonectæ_,\r\nor Boatmen.\r\n\r\nThe _Nepa cinerea_ (Fig. 75), which Geoffroy calls the Oval-bodied\r\nWater Scorpion, and which he also designates by the name of the Water\r\nSpider, is very common in the stagnant waters of ponds and ditches.\r\nIts body, oval, very flat, of an ashy colour, with red on the abdomen,\r\nis four-fifths of an inch long. The hemelytra are horizontal,\r\ncoriaceous, and of a dirty grey colour. Its front legs, with short\r\nhaunches, and very broad thighs, are terminated by strong pincers,\r\nwhich give to the insect a strong resemblance to the scorpion. It is\r\nby folding back the leg and the tarsus under the thigh, that the\r\nanimal holds its prey, and sucks it with its rostrum or beak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--Nepa cinerea.]\r\n\r\nThis rostrum is composed of three joints, and contains four pointed\r\nbristles. Two present on one side a sort of narrow sharp blade, and\r\nhave teeth towards their base. Of the two others, the one is a thin\r\nsmooth needle, the other is provided with hairs directed backwards and\r\nforwards.\r\n\r\nIt is with this rostrum, which resembles a case of surgical\r\ninstruments, that the _Nepa_ pierces and sucks little aquatic insects,\r\nnot even sparing its own species. Its wound is painful to man, but not\r\nin the least dangerous. With its four hind legs the _Nepa_ swims, but\r\nat a very slow pace. It generally drags itself along the bottom of\r\nthe water, on the mud, and does not avoid the hand put out to seize\r\nit. Its body is terminated by a tail, composed of two grooved threads,\r\nwhich, when applied together, form a tube, capable of being moved from\r\nside to side. Through this canal it breathes the outer air; it puts\r\nthe end of it out of the water, and the air enters it by inspiration.\r\nSome very small hairs, with which the interiors of the grooves are\r\nlined, interlace each other, and prevent the water from penetrating\r\ninto the canal. It is probable that this same canal serves also for\r\ndepositing the eggs. These last resemble small seeds, covered with\r\npoints, and are buried in the stalks of aquatic plants.\r\n\r\nNext to the _Nepa_ comes the _Ranatra_, with a cylindrical, elongated,\r\nlinear body, with very long and very thin hind legs, and of which one\r\nspecies, which Geoffroy calls the \"aquatic scorpion with an elongated\r\nbody,\" is common everywhere in stagnant waters in spring. It is\r\nbrownish, carnivorous, and very voracious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Corixa striata.]\r\n\r\nWe must now mention the genus _Corixa_, of which one species, the\r\n_Corixa striata_, is very common. This insect walks badly and slowly\r\non land, but swims and cuts through the water with a prodigious\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not to delay over this last species that we have here\r\nmentioned the name of this genus. Some insects which belong to it, and\r\nwhich are found in Mexico, deserve to be alluded to, on account of\r\ncertain peculiarities which their eggs present. A naturalist, M.\r\nVirlet d'Aoust, has published the following details on this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"Thousands of small amphibious flies,\" he says, \"flit about in the air\r\non the surface of lakes, and diving down into the water many feet, and\r\neven many fathoms, go to the bottom to lay their eggs, and only emerge\r\nfrom the water probably to die close by. We were fortunate enough to\r\nbe present at a great fishing or harvest of the eggs, which, under the\r\nMexican name of _hautle_ (_haoutle_), serve for food to the Indians,\r\nwho seem to be no less fond of them than the Chinese are of their\r\nswallows' nests, which they resemble somewhat in taste; only the\r\n_hautle_ is far from commanding such high prices as the Chinese pay\r\nfor their birds' nests, which for that reason are reserved entirely\r\nfor the tables of the rich; while, for a few small coins, we were\r\nable to carry away with us about a bushel of the _hautle_, a portion\r\nof which, at our request, Mme. B---- was kind enough to prepare for\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"They dress these in different ways, but generally make a sort of\r\ncake, which is served up with a sauce, to which the Mexicans give a\r\nzest, as they do indeed to all their dishes, by adding to it _chilié_,\r\nwhich is composed of green pimento crushed. This is how the natives\r\nproceed when they are fishing for _hautle_: they form with reeds bent\r\ntogether a sort of fasces, which they place vertically in the lake at\r\nsome distance from the bank, and as these are bound together by one of\r\nthe reeds, the ends of which are so arranged as to form an indicating\r\nbuoy, it is easy to draw them out at will. Twelve to fifteen days\r\nsuffice for each reed in these fasces to be entirely covered with\r\neggs, which they thus fish up by millions. The former are then left to\r\ndry in the sun, on a cloth, for an hour or more; the grains are then\r\neasily detached. After this operation, they are replaced in the water\r\nfor the next hautle harvest.\"\r\n\r\nM. Virlet had attributed to flies the eggs of which we have been\r\nspeaking. But in 1851 M. Guérin-Méneville having received, transmitted\r\nto him by M. Ghiliani, eggs of which _hautle_ is made, and some of the\r\ninsects said to produce them, stated that the latter belonged to two\r\ndifferent species. The one had been known a long time since under the\r\nname of _Corixa mercenaria_; M. Guérin-Méneville called the other\r\n_Corixa femorata_.\r\n\r\nThe same entomologist discovered, among the eggs of these two species,\r\nother eggs of a more considerable size, and which he attributed to a\r\nnew species of the genus _Notonecta_, about which we are now going to\r\nsay a few words.\r\n\r\nThe _Notonecta glauca_, which Geoffroy calls the Large Bug with Oars\r\n(\"Grande punaise à avirons\"), is very common in ditches, reservoirs,\r\nand stagnant waters. Its body is oblong, narrow, contracted\r\nposteriorly, convex above, flat below, having, at its sides and its\r\nextremities, hairs which, when spread out, support the animal on the\r\nwater. Its head is large and of a slightly greenish grey, and has on\r\neach of its sides a very large eye of a pale brown colour. Its thorax\r\nis greyish, the hemelytra of a greenish grey, the membranous wings\r\nwhite. Of its legs, the front four are short; but the hind legs,\r\nalmost twice as long, are furnished with long hairs, and resemble\r\noars. It is with the aid of these that the animal moves through the\r\nwater; and it does so in a singular manner, placing itself on its\r\nback, and generally in an inclined position, as in Fig. 77.\r\n\r\nWhen this insect, on the contrary, drags itself along on the mud, the\r\nfront legs are those which it employs, the hind legs being idle, and\r\nmerely drawn along behind it. It is generally towards the evening or\r\nduring the night that it comes out of the water, to walk and to fly,\r\nif it wishes to pass from one marsh to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Notonecta glauca.]\r\n\r\nThis bloodthirsty insect lives entirely by rapine; it is one of the\r\nmost carnivorous of insects. Those which it attacks die very soon\r\nafter they have been hurt by it. De Geer thinks that the water bug\r\ndrops into the wound a poisonous humour. It seizes upon insects much\r\nbigger, and apparently much stronger, than itself, and does not spare\r\nits own species.\r\n\r\nThe instrument with which the _Notonecta_ attacks its prey is composed\r\nof a very strong and very long conical beak, formed of four joints.\r\nThe sucker is composed of an upper piece, short and pointed, and of\r\nfour fine pointed hairs.\r\n\r\nThe female of the _Notonecta glauca_ lays a great number of eggs,\r\nwhite, and of elongated shape, which it deposits on the stems and\r\nleaves of aquatic plants. The eggs are hatched at the beginning of\r\nspring, or in May, and the young ones at once begin to swim about like\r\ntheir mother, on their backs, belly upwards. M. Léon Dufour says on\r\nthis subject:--\r\n\r\n\"A dorsal region, raised like a donkey's back, or like the rounded\r\nkeel of a boat, and covered with a velvety substance, which renders it\r\nimpermeable, numerous fine fringes which garnish either the hind legs,\r\nor the borders of the abdomen and thorax, or lastly in a double row\r\nform a crest or comb running down the surface of the belly, and which\r\nspread themselves out or fold themselves in at the will of the insect,\r\njust like fins, favour both this supine attitude and the accuracy of\r\nthe swimming movements of the _Notonectæ_. Since Nature--which seems\r\noften to delight in producing extraordinary exceptions to her ordinary\r\nrules, thus bearing witness to the immensity of her resources--had\r\ncondemned this animal to pass its life in an inverted position, it was\r\nnecessary, for the maintenance of its existence, that it should\r\nprovide it with an organisation in harmony with this attitude. It is\r\nalso for this object that its head is bent over its chest; that its\r\neyes, of an oval shape, can see below from above; that the front as\r\nwell as the middle legs, agile and curved, solely destined for\r\nprehension, can to a certain extent become unbent by means of the\r\nelongated haunches which fix them to the body, and clutch firm hold of\r\ntheir prey with the strong claws which terminate the tarsi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMOPTERA.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second group of the order Hemiptera, namely,\r\nHomoptera.\r\n\r\nThe insects which compose this division are numerous. They may be\r\narranged into three great families, of the most remarkable members of\r\nwhich we shall give some account. These are the _Cicadæ_, the _Aphidæ_\r\nor Plant Lice, and the _Coccidæ_.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada is the type of the first of these families. It has a deafening\r\nand monotonous song; as Bilboquet says, in the \"Saltimbanques,\" \"those\r\nwho like that note have enough of it for their money.\" Virgil pronounced\r\na just criticism on the song of the Cicada: he saw in it nothing better\r\nthan a hoarse and disagreeable sound:--\r\n\r\n  \"At mecum raucis, tua dum vestigia lustro,\r\n  Sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis,\"\r\n\r\nsays the Latin poet in his \"Eclogues,\" and repeats the same opinion in\r\na verse in his \"Georgics:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"Et cantu querulæ rumpent arbusta cicadæ.\"\r\n\r\nThe song of the Cicada, so sharp, so discordant, was, however, the\r\ndelight of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nListen to Plato in the first lines of \"Phædo:\" \"By Hera,\" cries the\r\nphilosopher-poet, \"what a charming place for repose!... It might well\r\nbe consecrated to some nymphs and to the river Achelöu, to judge by\r\nthese figures and statues. Taste a little the good air one breathes.\r\nHow charming, how sweet! One hears as a summer noise an harmonious\r\nmurmur accompanying the chorus of the Cicada.\"\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, then, had quite a peculiar taste for the song of the\r\nCicada. They liked to hear its screeching notes, sharp as a point of\r\nsteel. To enjoy it quite at their ease they shut them up in open\r\nwicker-work cages, pretty much in the same way as children shut up the\r\ncricket, so as to hear its joyous _cri-cri_. They carried their love\r\nfor this insect with the screaming voice so far as to make it the\r\nsymbol of music. We see, in drawings emblematical of the musical art,\r\na Cicada resting on strings of a cythera. A Grecian legend relates\r\nthat one day two cythera players, Eunomos and Aristo, contending on\r\nthis sonorous instrument, one of the strings of the former's cythera\r\nhaving broken, a Cicada settled on it, and sang so well in place of\r\nthe broken cord, that Eunomos gained the victory, thanks to this\r\nunexpected assistant. Anacreon composed an ode in honour of the\r\nCicada. \"Happy Cicada, that on the highest branches of the trees,\r\nhaving drank a little dew, singest like a queen! Thy realm is all thou\r\nseest in the fields, all which grows in the forests. Thou art beloved\r\nby the labourer; no one harms thee; the mortals respect thee as the\r\nsweet harbinger of summer. Thou art cherished by the muses, cherished\r\nby Phoebus himself, who has given thee thy harmonious song. Old age\r\ndoes not oppress thee. O good little animal, sprung from the bosom of\r\nthe earth, loving song, free from suffering, that hast neither blood\r\nnor flesh, what is there prevents thee from being a god?\"\r\n\r\nIt was in virtue of the false ideas of the Greeks on natural history\r\nin general, and on the Cicada in particular, that this little animal\r\nsymbolised, among the Athenians, nobility of race. They imagined that\r\nthe Cicada was formed at the expense of the earth, and in its bosom,\r\non which account those who pretended to an ancient and high origin,\r\nwore in their hair a golden Cicada. The Locrians had on their coins\r\nthe image of a Cicada. This is the origin which fable assigns to the\r\ncustom:--\r\n\r\nThe bank of the river upon which Locris was built was covered with\r\nscreeching legions of Cicadas; whereas they were never heard (so says\r\nthe legend) on the opposite bank, on which stood the town Rhegium. In\r\nexplanation of this circumstance, they pretend that Hercules, wishing\r\none day to sleep on this bank, was so tormented by the \"sweet\r\neloquence\" of the Cicadas, that, furious at their concert, he asked of\r\nthe gods that they should never sing there for evermore, and his\r\nprayer was immediately granted! This is why the Locrians adopted the\r\nCicada as the arms of their city.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks did not only delight, as poets and musicians, in the song\r\nof the Cicada; they were not content with addressing to it poems, with\r\nadoring it, and striking medals bearing its image; obedient to their\r\ngrosser appetites, they ate it. They thus satisfied at the same time\r\nboth the mind, the spirit, and the body.\r\n\r\nThe Cicadas are easily to be recognised by their heavy, very robust,\r\nand rather thick-set bodies, by their broad head, unprolonged, having\r\nvery large and prominent _ocelli_, or simple eyes, three in number,\r\narranged in a triangle on the top of the forehead, and short antennæ.\r\nThe immature anterior and posterior wings have the shape of a sheath,\r\nor case, enveloping the body when the insect is at rest; these are\r\ntransparent and destitute of colour, or sometimes adorned with bright\r\nand varied hues. The legs are not in the least suited for jumping. The\r\nfemale is provided with an auger, with which she makes holes in the\r\nbark of trees in which to lay her eggs. The male (Fig. 78) is provided\r\nwith an organ, not of song, but of stridulation or screeching, which\r\nis very rudimentary in the female. We will stop a moment to consider\r\nthe apparatus for producing the song, or rather the noise, of the male\r\nCicada, and the structure of the female's auger. We are indebted to\r\nRéaumur for the discovery of the mechanism by the aid of which the\r\nCicada produces the sharp noise which announces its whereabouts from\r\nafar. We will give a summary of the celebrated Memoir in which the\r\nFrench naturalist has so admirably described the musical apparatus of\r\nthe Cicada.[24]\r\n\r\n    [24] \"Mémoires,\" tome v. 4to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Cicada (Male).]\r\n\r\nIt is not in the throat that the Cicada's organ of sound is placed,\r\nbut on the abdomen. On examining the abdomen of the male of a large\r\nspecies of Cicada, one remarks on it two horny plates, of pretty good\r\nsize, which are not found on the females. Each plate has one side\r\nstraight; the rest of its outline is rounded. It is by the side which\r\nis rectilinear that the plate is fixed immediately underneath the\r\nthird pair of legs. It can be slightly raised, with an effort, by two\r\nspine-like processes, each of which presses upon one of the plates,\r\nand when it is raised, prevents it from being raised too much, and\r\ncauses it to fall back again immediately.\r\n\r\nIf the two plates are removed and turned over on the thorax, and the\r\nparts which they hide laid bare, one is struck by the appearance which\r\nis presented. \"One cannot doubt that all one sees has been made to\r\nenable the Cicada to sing,\" says Réaumur. \"When one compares the parts\r\nwhich have been arranged so that it may be able to sing, as we may\r\nsay, from its belly, with the organs of our throat, one finds that\r\nours have not been made with more care than those by means of which\r\nthe Cicada gives forth sounds which are not always agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nWe here perceive a cavity in the anterior portion of the abdomen and\r\nwhich is divided into two principal cells by a horny triangle.\r\n\r\n\"The bottom of each cell offers to children who catch the Cicada a\r\nspectacle which amuses them, and which may be admired by men who know\r\nhow to make the best use of their reason. The children think they see\r\na little mirror of the thinnest and most transparent glass, or that a\r\nlittle blade of the most beautiful talc is set in the bottom of each\r\nof these little cells. That which one might see if this were the case\r\nwould in no way differ from what one actually sees; the membrane which\r\nis stretched out at the bottom of the cells does not yield in\r\ntransparency either to glass or to talc; and if one looks at it\r\nobliquely, one sees in it all the beautiful colours of the rainbow. It\r\nseems as if the Cicada has two glazed windows through which one can\r\nsee into the interior of its body.\"\r\n\r\nThe horny triangle of which we spoke above only separates in two the\r\nlower part of the cavity. The upper part is filled by a white, thin,\r\nbut strong membrane. This membrane is only drawn tight when the body\r\nof the Cicada is raised. But with all this, where is the organ of\r\nsong? What parts produce the sound? Réaumur will enlighten us on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nHe opened the back of a Cicada, and laid bare the portion of the\r\ninterior which corresponds with the cavity where the mirrors are, and\r\nwas immediately struck with the size of the two muscles which meet and\r\nare attached to the back of the horny triangle, and to that one of its\r\nangles from which start the sides which form the cavities in which are\r\nboth the mirrors.\r\n\r\n\"Muscles of such strength, placed in the belly of the Cicada, and in\r\nthat part of the belly in which they are found, seem to be only so\r\nplaced in order that they may move quickly backwards and forwards\r\nthose parts which, being set in motion, produce the noise or song. And\r\nindeed, whilst I was examining one of these muscles, in moving it\r\nabout gently with a pin, slightly displacing it, and then letting it\r\nreturn to its proper place, it so happened that I made a Cicada that\r\nhad been dead for many months sing. The song, as might be expected,\r\nwas not loud; but it was strong enough to lead me on to the discovery\r\nof the part to which it was due. I had only to follow the muscle I had\r\nbeen moving, to search for the part on which it abutted.\"\r\n\r\nIn the large cavity, in which are the mirrors and the other parts\r\nmentioned above, there are besides two equal and similar compartments,\r\ntwo cells, in which are placed the instrument of sound. This is a\r\nmembrane in the shape of a kettledrum, not smooth, but, on the\r\ncontrary, crumpled and full of wrinkles (Fig. 79). When it is touched\r\nit is more sonorous than the driest parchment. If the furrows on its\r\nconvex surface are rubbed with a small body, such as a piece of\r\nrolled-up paper, incapable of piercing or tearing it, it is easily\r\nmade to sound; and the sound is occasioned by the portions of the\r\nkettledrum which are depressed by the friction of the small body,\r\nreturning to their former position as soon as it has ceased to act\r\nupon them. It is here that the two strong muscles act whose existence\r\nand use were discovered by Réaumur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Musical Apparatus of the Male Cicada.]\r\n\r\n\"It is clear,\" says this naturalist, \"that when the muscle is\r\nalternately contracted and expanded with rapidity, one convex portion\r\nof the kettledrum will be rendered concave, and will then resume its\r\nconvex form by the force of its own spring. Then this noise will be\r\nmade, this song of which we have been so long seeking an explanation,\r\nbecause we wished to find out all the parts by means of which He, who\r\nnever makes anything without its use, willed that it should be\r\nproduced.\"\r\n\r\nLet us add, to complete what we have already said on this subject,\r\nthat if the kettledrums are the essential organs of the insect's song,\r\nthe mirrors, the white and wrinkled membranes, and the exterior\r\nshutters which cover in the whole apparatus, contribute largely, as\r\nRéaumur pointed out, to modify and strengthen the sound.\r\n\r\nWe have said above that the female Cicada does not sing; and so her\r\nsinging organs are quite rudimentary. This fact, moreover, has been\r\nknown for ages. Xenarchus, a poet of Rhodes, says, with little\r\ngallantry:--\r\n\r\n  \"Happy Cicadas! thy females are deprived of voice!\"\r\n\r\nNature has indemnified the female Cicada for this privation, by giving\r\nher an instrument less noisy indeed, but more useful. This is a sort\r\nof auger, destined to penetrate the bark of the branches of trees, and\r\nlodged in the last segment of the abdomen, which, for this purpose, is\r\nhollowed out groove-wise. By the aid of a system of muscles the auger\r\ncan be protruded or retracted at pleasure. It is furnished with three\r\nimplements. In the middle there is a piercer, or bodkin, which when\r\nrun into a branch supports the insect, and two _stylets_, whose upper\r\nedges, having teeth like a saw, resting back to back, on the middle\r\nimplement, move up and down it. With this admirable instrument the\r\nfemale Cicada incises obliquely the bark and wood until she has almost\r\nreached the pith (Fig. 80). The male sings while she is at work. When\r\nthe cell is sufficiently deep and properly prepared, the female lays\r\nat the bottom of it from five to eight eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Female Cicada laying her eggs in the groove\r\nshe has bored in the branch of a tree.]\r\n\r\nFrom these eggs come very small white grubs (Fig. 81), which leave\r\ntheir nest, descend by the trunk, and bury themselves in the ground,\r\nwhere they devour the roots of the tree. They then become pupæ, and\r\nhollowing out the earth with their front legs, which are very much\r\ndeveloped, continue to live at the expense of the roots. At the end\r\nof spring these pupæ (Fig. 82) come out of the earth, hook themselves\r\non to the trunks of trees, and strip themselves one fine evening of\r\ntheir skin, which remains whole and dried. Very weak at first, these\r\nmetamorphosed insects drag themselves along with difficulty. But next\r\nday, warmed by the first rays of the sun, having had, no doubt, time\r\nto reflect on their new social position, and less astonished than they\r\nwere on the preceding evening, they agitate their wings, they fly, and\r\nthe males send forth into the air the first notes of their screeching\r\nconcert. The Cicadas remain on trees, whose sap they suck by means of\r\ntheir sharp-pointed beak. It is difficult enough to catch them, for\r\nowing to their large, highly-developed wings, they fly rapidly away on\r\nthe slightest noise.\r\n\r\nThey inhabit the south of Europe, the whole of Africa from north to\r\nsouth, America in the same latitudes as Europe, the whole of the centre\r\nand south of Asia, New Holland, and the islands of Oceania. The Cicada,\r\nwhich in hot climates always exposes itself to the ardour of the\r\nmost scorching sun, is not found in temperate or cold regions. The\r\nconsequence is that the southern nations know it very well, whilst in\r\nthe north the large grasshopper, which is so common in those regions,\r\nand whose song closely resembles that of the Cicada, is commonly taken\r\nfor it. There was to be seen at the Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1866 a\r\npicture by M. Aussandon, \"La Cigale et la Fourmi,\" which showed, under\r\nan allegorical shape, the subject of La Fontaine's fable. The painter\r\nhere represented the Cigale, or Cicada, under the form of a magnificent\r\napple-green grasshopper. The artist materialised here, as we may say,\r\nthe common mistake of the inhabitants of the north, which makes them\r\nconfound the Cicada with the great green grasshopper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Larva of the Cicada.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--Pupa of the Cicada.]\r\n\r\nFor the rest, we may, by-the-by, say that La Fontaine's fable of \"La\r\nCigale et la Fourmi\" is full of errors in natural history. Nothing is\r\neasier than to prove the truth of this assertion. From the very first\r\nverses, the author shows that he has never observed the animal of\r\nwhich he speaks.\r\n\r\n  \"La Cigale ayant chanté\r\n  Tout l'été.\"\r\n\r\nNo Cicada could sing \"tout l'été,\" since it lives at the utmost for a\r\nfew weeks only.\r\n\r\n  \"Se trouva fort dépourvue\r\n  Quand la bise fut venue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quand la bise fut venue\" means without doubt the month of November or\r\nDecember. But at this season of the year the Cicada has a long time\r\nsince passed from life to death. When one wanders along the outskirts\r\nof woods as early as the month of October, in the south of France, one\r\nfinds the soil covered with dead Cicadas. La Fontaine's _Cigale_ then\r\ncould not have found itself \"fort dépourvue,\" for the simple reason\r\nthat it was already dead.\r\n\r\n  \"Elle alla crier famine\r\n  Chez la Fourmi, sa voisine,\r\n  La priant de lui preter\r\n  Quelque grain pour subsister.\"\r\n\r\nThe ant is carnivorous, and although it likes honey, it has nothing to\r\ndo with grains of wheat, nor with any other grain, of which, according\r\nto the fabulist, it had laid up a stock. On the other hand, the\r\nCicada, which he blames for having\r\n\r\n  \"Pas un seul petit morceau\r\n  De mouche ou de vermisseau,\"\r\n\r\nnever dreamt of such victuals, for it lives entirely on the sap of\r\nlarge vegetables. The fables of the poet, who is called in France, one\r\nnever knows why, \"Le bon La Fontaine,\" teem with errors of the same\r\nkind as those we have just pointed out. The habits of animals are\r\nnearly always represented as exactly the contrary to what they really\r\nare. To initiate himself into the mysteries of the habits of animals,\r\nLa Fontaine certainly had neither the works of Buffon nor the memoirs\r\nof Réaumur, which had not then been written; but had he not the book\r\nof Nature?\r\n\r\nBut it is time to mention the principal species of the Cicada. We will\r\ndescribe two: that of the Ash, which lives on those trees in the south\r\nof France; and that of the Manna Ash, which is very common in the\r\nsouth-east of France. It is particularly plentiful in the forests of\r\npines which abound between Bayonne and Bordeaux. It is on these two\r\nspecies of Cicada that Réaumur made the beautiful observations of\r\nwhich we gave a summary above.\r\n\r\nThe _Cicada plebeia_ or _Tettigonia fraxini_, very common in Provence,\r\nis found, though rarely, in the forest of Fontainebleau, occasionally\r\nin La Brie. It is of a grey yellow below, black above; the head and\r\nthorax are marked or striped with black.\r\n\r\nM. Solier, in a Memoir inserted in the \"Annales de la Société\r\nEntomologique de France,\" says that its song, very loud and very\r\npiercing, seems to consist of one single note, repeated with rapidity,\r\nwhich insensibly grows weaker after a certain time, and terminates in\r\na kind of whistle, which can be partly imitated by pronouncing the two\r\nconsonants _st_, and which resembles the noise of the air coming out\r\nof a little opening in a compressed bladder. When the Cicada sings, it\r\nmoves its abdomen violently, in such a manner as alternately to move\r\nit away from, and to bring it near to, the little covers of the\r\nsonorous cavities; to this movement is added a slight trembling of the\r\nmesothorax.\r\n\r\nThe same entomologist relates a very interesting observation made on\r\nthis species of Cicada by his friend, M. Boyer, a chemist at Aix, and\r\nwhich he himself verified. The Cicadas, in general, are very timid,\r\nand fly away at the least noise. However, when a Cicada is singing,\r\none can approach it, whistling the while in a quavering manner, and\r\nimitating as nearly as possible, its cry, but in such a manner as to\r\npredominate over it. The insect then descends a small space down the\r\ntree, as if to approach the whistler; then it stops. But if one\r\npresents a stick to it, continuing to whistle, the Cicada settles on\r\nit and begins again to descend backwards. From time to time it stops,\r\nas if to listen. At last, attracted, and, as it were, fascinated by\r\nthe harmony of the whistle, it comes to the observer himself.\r\n\r\nM. Boyer managed thus to make a Cicada, which continued to sing as\r\nlong as he whistled in harmony with it, settle on his nose. Charmed by\r\nthis concert, the insect seemed to have lost its natural timidity.\r\n\r\nThe _Cicada orni_ is of a greenish yellow, spotted with black. The\r\nabdomen is encircled by the same colours. The elytra and the wings are\r\nhyaline, or glassy, and their veins alternately yellow and brown. The\r\nlegs are yellow throughout. The song of this species is hoarse, and\r\ncannot be heard at any great distance.\r\n\r\nM. Solier, in the work we quoted just now, says that the song of this\r\nCicada is of a deeper intonation, but that it is quick and is sooner\r\nover. It does not terminate in the manner which characterises that of\r\nthe other species.\r\n\r\nNext the genus _Cicada_ comes _Fulgora_, whose type is the _Fulgora\r\nlanternaria_, or Lantern Fly (Fig. 83).\r\n\r\nBelonging to South America, these insects are above all remarkable and\r\neasy to recognise, by their very large elongated head, which nearly\r\nequals three-quarters of the rest of the body. This prolongation is\r\nhorizontal, vesiculous, enlarged to about the same breadth as the\r\nhead, and presents above a very great gibbosity. The antennæ are\r\nshort, with a globular second articulation, and a small terminal hair.\r\nThe species represented in Fig. 83 is yellow varied with black. The\r\nelytra are of a greenish yellow, sprinkled with black; the wings, of\r\nthe same colour, have at the extremity a large spot resembling an eye,\r\nwhich is surrounded by a brown circle very broad in front. It inhabits\r\nGuyana. This remarkable insect enjoys a great renown with the vulgar,\r\nby a peculiarity which might be called its speciality--the property of\r\nshining by night or in the dark. Hence its name of _Fulgora\r\nlanternaria_.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the _Fulgora lanternaria_ has been spread and\r\npopularised in Europe by a celebrated book, which has for its\r\ntitle, \"Métamorphoses des Insectes de Surinam.\" This book, which\r\ncontains the result of patient study of the natural history of Dutch\r\nGuyana (Government of Surinam), was written and published in three\r\nlanguages, by a woman whose name this work has rendered immortal--Mlle.\r\nSybille de Mérian--and who won the admiration and respect of her\r\ncontemporaries by her love of the beauties of Nature, and her\r\nperseverance in making them known and admired. Sybille de Mérian was\r\nborn at Bâle. Daughter, sister, and mother of celebrated engravers,\r\nherself an excellent flower-painter, she had worked a long time at\r\nFrankfort and at Nuremburg; and had read with the greatest attention\r\nthe \"Théologie des Insectes,\"[25] and with admiration Malpighi's book\r\non the silkworm. Full of enthusiasm for the study of natural history,\r\nshe left Germany, to visit the magnificent collection of plants which\r\nwere kept in the hot-houses of Holland, and made admirable\r\nreproductions of them with her pencil.\r\n\r\n    [25] \"Théologie des Insectes, ou Démonstration des Perfections\r\n    de Dieu dans tout ce qui concerne les Insectes, par Lesser,\r\n    traduit en Français.\" La Haye, 1742.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Lantern Fly (_Fulgora lanternaria_).]\r\n\r\nThis attentive study of the vegetable world suggested to her the idea,\r\nwhich soon became an ardent desire, of observing these marvels of\r\nNature in those parts of the globe in which they display themselves\r\nwith the greatest magnificence and splendour. At the age of\r\nfifty-four, Sybille de Mérian set out for equatorial America. From the\r\nvery first days of her arrival she hazarded her life, sometimes\r\nwithout a guide, in the swampy plains or burning valleys of Guyana.\r\nDuring the two years she sojourned in those dangerous parts, she made\r\na large collection of drawings and paintings, which were destined to\r\ninaugurate in Europe the introduction of art into natural history.\r\n\r\nIn the plates to her work, Sybille de Mérian represents always the\r\ninsects she wishes to describe under its three forms of larva, pupa,\r\nand perfect insect. With this drawing she gives another of the plants\r\nwhich serves the insect for food, as also of the animals which prey on\r\nit. Each plate is a little drama. Near the insect is seen the greedy\r\nlizard opening its dreadful mouth, or the ferocious spider watching\r\nfor it. The short life of insects is shown here in its entirety, with\r\nits continual struggles, its infinite artifices, its rapid end, and\r\nall the episodes of its existence, for which life, as in the case of\r\nthe moral man, is but a long and painful struggle.\r\n\r\nSuch was the work, such was the noble devotion and the worthy career\r\nof Sybille de Mérian. Let women, let young girls, who are martyrs to\r\nthe ennui of a life devoid of occupation, peruse her beautiful books,\r\nand learn from it how much a woman may do with the time which is now\r\neither utterly unoccupied or only devoted to useless employments. To\r\nstudy Nature in any of its phases ought, it seems to us, to give more\r\nsatisfaction to the soul, more strength to the mind, and cause more\r\nadmiration of and gratitude to the supreme Author of Nature than doing\r\na little embroidery.\r\n\r\nIt is, as we have already said, in the work of Sybille de Mérian,\r\n\"Métamorphoses des Insectes de Surinam,\" that one finds mentioned, for\r\nthe first time, the luminous properties of the _Fulgora lanternaria_.\r\nThe author thus relates her observations, which were the result of\r\nchance:--\r\n\r\n\"Some Indians having one day brought me a great number of the Lantern\r\nFlies, I shut them up in a large box, not knowing then that they gave\r\nlight at night. Hearing a noise, I sprang out of bed and had a candle\r\nbrought. I very soon discovered that the noise proceeded from the box,\r\nwhich I hurriedly opened; but, alarmed at seeing emerging from it a\r\nflame, or, to speak more correctly, as many flames as there were\r\ninsects, I at first let it fall. Having recovered from my astonishment,\r\nor rather from my fright, I caught all my insects again, and admired\r\nthis singular property of theirs.\"\r\n\r\nSince the time when Mlle. de Mérian visited Guyana, different\r\ntravellers have said that they could not observe, as she did, this\r\nphosphorescent phenomenon. It is, then, probable that this property\r\nonly exists in the male or female insect, and then only at certain\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nWhat a marvellous spectacle must the rich valleys of Guyana present,\r\nwhen, in the stillness of the night, the air is filled with living\r\ntorches; when, the _Fulgoræ_ flying about in space, the flashes of\r\nfire cross each other, go out and blaze up again, shine brightly and\r\nthen die out, and present, on a calm evening, the appearance of those\r\nlightning flashes which are usually seen only in the midst of a\r\ntempest!\r\n\r\nLet us now go on to another interesting insect of the order of which\r\nwe are treating, the Aphrophora, without being frightened by its\r\ndisagreeable name, for there are many other names we may give it if we\r\nchoose among those by which it is popularly known. In the months of\r\nJune and July one sees on nearly every tree, and on plants of the most\r\ndifferent kinds, a sort of white froth, composed of air bubbles,\r\ndeposited on the leaves and branches. It is produced by an insect\r\nwhich the peasants in France call _Crachat de Coucou_, or _Ecume\r\nprintanière_ (spring froth), and which is called in England, Cuckoo's\r\nspittle. De Geer carefully studied the metamorphoses of this insect.\r\nThe Aphrophora (from [Greek: aphros], foam, and [Greek: pherô], I bear\r\nor carry) is lodged in the froth of which we have just been speaking.\r\nIt lives in it, only leaving it when it has its wings. De Geer\r\nwondered why this insect confines itself during the whole of its life\r\nin liquid, and concludes that the froth has the effect of protecting\r\nthe insect from the burning heat of the sun. This covering seems also\r\nto protect it from the attacks of carnivorous insects and spiders. On\r\nthe other hand, its skin is without doubt so constituted that it would\r\nperspire too freely if it were exposed to the air, and the insect\r\nwould very soon die dried up. Whatever explanation may be given of the\r\nnecessity for this semi-aërial, semi-liquid medium, it is easy to\r\nverify the fact that the larva of the Aphrophora cannot live long out\r\nof its frothy envelope. If withdrawn from it, the volume of its body\r\ndiminishes perceptibly, and the poor animal dies, like a fish taken\r\nout of its natural element.\r\n\r\nThe insects which live in this froth are six-legged grubs (Fig. 84),\r\nwhich, when the froth is cleared from them, walk quickly enough on the\r\nstalks and leaves of plants. They are green, with the belly yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Larva of the Aphrophora (_Aphrophora\r\nspumaria_).]\r\n\r\nDe Geer wished to know how they produced this singular froth, and\r\nfound out in the following manner:--He took one of them out of its\r\nfrothy dwelling, wiped it dry with a camel's-hair pencil, and placed\r\nit on a young stalk, recently cut from the honeysuckle, which he put\r\ninto water in a glass, in order to preserve its freshness, and this is\r\nwhat he observed:--\r\n\r\n\"It begins,\" says the Swedish naturalist, \"by fixing itself on a\r\ncertain part of the stalk, in which it inserts the end of its trunk,\r\nand remains thus for a long time in the same attitude, occupied in\r\nsucking and filling itself with the sap. Having then withdrawn its\r\ntrunk, it remains there, or else places itself on a leaf, where, after\r\ndifferent reiterated movements of its abdomen, which it raises or\r\nlowers and turns on all sides, one may see coming out of the hinder\r\npart of its body a little ball of liquid, which it causes to slip\r\nalong, bending it under its body. Beginning the same movements again,\r\nit is not long in producing a second globule of liquid, filled with\r\nair like the first, which it places side by side with, and close to,\r\nthe preceding one, and continues the same operation as long as there\r\nremains any sap in its body. It is very soon covered with a number of\r\nsmall globules, which, coming out of its body one after the other,\r\ntend towards the front part, aided in this by the movement of the\r\nabdomen. It is all these globules collected together which form a\r\nwhite and extremely fine froth whose viscosity keeps the air shut up\r\nin the globules, and prevents its froth from easily evaporating. If\r\nthe sap which the larva has drawn from the plant is exhausted before\r\nit feels itself sufficiently covered with froth, it begins to suck\r\nafresh, until it has got a new and sufficient quantity of froth,\r\nwhich it takes care to add to its first stock.\"[26]\r\n\r\n    [26] \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes,\"\r\n    tome iii.\r\n\r\nIt is in the froth that the larvæ change into pupæ, and they do not\r\nleave their habitation to undergo their final metamorphosis. They have\r\nthen, says De Geer, the art of causing the froth inside to evaporate\r\nand dry up, in such a manner as to form a space inside the mass of\r\nfroth, in which their bodies are entirely free. The exterior froth\r\nforms a roof closed in on all sides, under which the insect lies quite\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nIn this vaulted cell the pupa disengages itself little by little from\r\nits skin, which first splits up along the head, and then on the\r\nthorax. This opening is sufficiently large to enable it to come out of\r\nits envelope. It is in the month of September that these insects are\r\nparticularly abundant, and then the trees and plants are covered with\r\nthem. Sometimes the froth drips off, like a sort of small rain, from\r\nbranches which are covered with it. Towards the autumn the females are\r\npregnant. They are then so heavy that they can hardly jump or fly. The\r\nmales, on the contrary, make prodigious bounds; they throw themselves\r\nforward to a distance of more than two yards. They are very difficult\r\nto catch, and still more difficult to find again when one has once let\r\nthem escape. And so Swammerdam calls these insects _Sauterelles-Puces_\r\n(Flea-Grasshoppers), because they jump like fleas.\r\n\r\nAll that we have said relates to the _Aphrophora spumaria_, or\r\nFroghopper (Fig. 85), an insect common all over Europe, and which\r\nGeoffroy calls the _Cigale bedeaude_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--The Froghopper (_Aphrophora spumaria_).]\r\n\r\n\"It is of a brown colour,\" says Geoffroy, \"often rather greenish. Its\r\nhead, its thorax, and its elytra, are finely dotted; on these last one\r\nsees two white oblong spots. The lower part of the insect is light\r\nbrown.\"[27]\r\n\r\n    [27] \"Histoire abrégée des Insectes, dans laquelle ces animaux\r\n    sont rangés dans un ordre méthodique.\" In 4to. Tome i., p. 416.\r\n    An VII. de la République.\r\n\r\nWe will mention, as it belongs to the group with which we are now\r\noccupied, a noxious insect, _Iassus devastans_, which since 1844 seems\r\nto have taken up its quarters in the commune of Saint Paul, in the\r\ndepartment of the Basses-Alpes. It sucks the leaves and stalks of\r\ncereals, causing them to wither, and may be found even in winter\r\non young corn, but principally in the spring. According to M.\r\nGuérin-Méneville, its head is of an ochrey yellow, with the apex\r\nmarked with black spots; the forehead yellow, elongated, striped with\r\nblack, as are the legs. The elytra are straw-coloured and spotted with\r\nbrown. The wings are transparent, and slightly blackened at the\r\nextremities. This remarkable insect, which is not more than the\r\ntwelfth of an inch in length, jumps and flies with great ease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--1. Hypsauchenia balista. 2. Membracis foliata.\r\n3. Centrotus cornutus. 4. Umbonia Spinosa. 5. Bocydium globulare.\r\n6. Cyphonia furcata.]\r\n\r\nA small brownish insect, whose strange appearance struck Geoffroy, the\r\nhistorian of the insects of the environs of Paris, may be seen\r\nspringing over the fern stalks and thistles, in the damp parts of most\r\nof the woods of Europe.\r\n\r\nGeoffroy calls this insect \"le Petit Diable.\" \"Le Petit Diable,\" he\r\nwrites, \"is of a dark blackish-brown. Its head is flat, projecting but\r\nslightly, and, as it were, bent downwards. Its thorax, which is rather\r\nbroad, has two sharp horns, which terminate in pretty long points on\r\nthe sides. In the middle of the thorax is a crest or comb, which,\r\nprolonged into a sort of sinuous and crooked horn, terminates in a\r\nvery sharp point, reaching to within one quarter of the extremity\r\nof the wing-cases. These--viz., the wing-cases--are dark, with\r\nbrown veins; and the wings, shorter than their cases, are rather\r\ntransparent. The insect jumps very well, and is not readily\r\ncaught.\"[28]\r\n\r\n    [28] \"Histoire abrégée des Insectes, dans laquelle ces animaux\r\n    sont rangés dans un ordre méthodique.\" In 4to. Tome i., p. 423.\r\n    An VII. de la République.\r\n\r\nThe Petit Diable of Geoffroy is the _Centrotus cornutus_ of modern\r\nnaturalists. This curious little insect belongs to a strange and\r\nremarkable group, whose thorax takes the most extraordinary and most\r\nvaried forms, as may be seen in Fig. 86, which represents somewhat\r\nmagnified, many of these insects. Nearly all inhabit Guyana, the\r\nBrazils, and Florida.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to examine one of the most interesting groups of\r\ninsects--that of the Plant-lice. These insects have for a long time\r\nattracted the attention of naturalists. They are so abundant that all\r\nour readers have seen them, and there are few plants in our fields or\r\ngardens which do not nourish some species. How often does one hesitate\r\nin gathering a rose or a bit of honeysuckle, for fear of touching the\r\nunattractive guest of those charming flowers!\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the summer one sees on the branches, on the\r\nleaves, but principally on the young shoots of the rose-tree, large\r\ncompanies of green plant-lice, which subsist on the sap of the tree.\r\nSome are provided with wings (Figs. 87, 88), others are wingless\r\n(Figs. 89, 90). The last-named are the largest, and are a line and a\r\nhalf long. They are entirely green, except two parts, of which we will\r\nspeak immediately. The body is oval; the head is small, and furnished\r\nwith two brown eyes. The skin is smooth, and tightly drawn over the\r\nbody. The antennæ, which are very long and slender, almost equal the\r\nbody in length. The six legs are long and slim, and the short feet\r\nterminate in two hooks. On the upper part of the body are two small\r\ncylindrical horns, surmounted by a small knob. The antennæ and these\r\nhorns are black.\r\n\r\nThe winged individuals are of the same size as these, but are of a\r\ndark green colour, mixed with black. The wings are transparent, and\r\nthe upper ones are as long again as the body. The young shoots of the\r\nelder-tree, all round their circumference for the length of from a\r\nfoot to a foot and a half, are often covered with black plant-lice, or\r\nwith those of a greenish-black colour. They are crowded one against\r\nthe other, and sometimes there are two layers of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87, 88.--Winged Aphides, or Plant-lice (magnified).]\r\n\r\nIf observed without moving the plant about, they appear to be tranquil\r\nand inactive. They are, however, then absorbing from the plant the\r\nnourishment it should have; piercing with the point of their trunks\r\nthe epidermis of the leaves or stalks, and drawing from them a\r\nnourishing liquid.\r\n\r\nBut this occupation is confined to those which are on the plant\r\nitself. Those which, on account of the enormous agglomeration of these\r\ninsects, walk, not on the branch, but on other plant-lice, and cannot\r\ntherefore suck the sap of the plant, are employed entirely in\r\npreserving and multiplying their species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89, 90.--Wingless Aphides, or Plant-lice (magnified).]\r\n\r\nRéaumur often saw the latter, easily recognised by their great size,\r\ngiving birth to little plant-lice, which are quite alive when they\r\nleave their mother. The young ones set off and mount or descend till\r\nthey reach one end of the crowd, and there each takes up its position,\r\nlike a cardboard capuchin (_capucin de carte_), in such a manner that\r\nthe head is just behind the plant-louse which precedes it. There they\r\nbury their trunks in the vegetable tissue, and set to work to imbibe\r\nthe sap.\r\n\r\nSmall as is the trunk of the plant-louse, yet when there are thousands\r\nof those little beings fixed to the stalk or the leaves of a plant, it\r\nis evident that it must suffer. And so the plant-louse is, in truth,\r\none of the most terrible enemies of our agricultural and horticultural\r\nproductions, and the exact list of the ravages which it occasions\r\nwould be indeed interminable. We will confine ourselves to a few\r\nexamples. For some years the lime-tree aphis has seriously attacked\r\nthe lime-trees of the public promenades of Paris. The peach-tree\r\nplant-louse causes the blight of the leaves of that tree. It is to\r\nthese prolific little parasites that are due, in a great number of\r\ncases, the contortions of leaves and of the young shoots of trees of\r\nall sorts.\r\n\r\nThese insatiable depredators cause sometimes a still more remarkable\r\nalteration. On the leaves of elms are often seen bladders round and\r\nrosy, like little apples. On opening these bladders one finds that\r\nthey are inhabited by a species of aphis. On the black poplar galls of\r\ndifferent kinds grow, some from the leaf stalks, and others from the\r\nyoung stems. They are rounded, oblong, horned, and twisted into a\r\nspiral. Other galls show themselves on the leaf itself. They are all\r\ninhabited by plant-lice, differing from those of which we have given a\r\ndescription above, in the extremity of their abdomen not presenting\r\nthe two remarkable horns to which we shall have later to call the\r\nattention of the reader. The body is generally covered with a long and\r\nthick down.\r\n\r\nOf this genus, the species, alas! so unfortunately celebrated is the\r\nApple-tree Aphis (_Myzoxyle mali_), which attacks that tree. This\r\ninsect is of a dark russet brown, with the upper part of the abdomen\r\ncovered with very long white down. Its presence was announced for the\r\nfirst time in England in 1789, and in France, in the department of the\r\nCôtes du Nord, in 1812. In 1818 it was found in Paris, in the garden\r\nof the École de Pharmacie. It had become common in 1822 in the\r\ndepartments of the Seine, the Somme, and the Aisne. In 1827 its\r\npresence in Belgium was announced.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree aphis, according to M. Blot, can only exist on that\r\ntree. Carried away and placed on any other, it very soon perishes. It\r\ndoes not attack the blossom, the fruit, nor the leaves, but fixes\r\nitself on the lower part of the trunk, whence it propagates itself\r\ndownwards as far as the roots, underneath the graftings, &c. It also\r\nlikes to lodge in cracks of the trunk and large branches. But it\r\nalways looks out for a southern, and avoids a northern aspect. It is\r\nnot active, walks very little, and its dissemination from one place to\r\nanother can only be explained by the facility with which so small an\r\ninsect can be transported by the wind, its lightness being still more\r\nincreased by the down which covers it.\r\n\r\nThe _Myzoxyle mali_ renders the wood knotty, dry, hard, brittle, and\r\nbrings on rapidly all the symptoms which characterise old age and\r\ndecay in attacked trees. M. Blot recommends the following means for\r\npreserving the apple-tree from this insect: Employ for the seed-beds\r\nthe pips of bitter apples only; give to the nursery and to the plants\r\nonly as much shelter as is absolutely necessary; avoid those sites\r\nwhich are too low and too damp; encourage the circulation of air, and\r\nthe desiccation of the soil; surround the foot of each apple-tree with\r\na mixture of soot or of tobacco and fine sand.\r\n\r\nAs for the manner of freeing a tree once invaded by this insect, the\r\nmost simple plan is to rub the trunk and the branches, in order to\r\ncrush the insects, or to employ a brush or broom.\r\n\r\nWe spoke above of the reproduction of the aphis, but without entering\r\ninto any particular details; we will now touch upon this question, one\r\nof the most interesting in natural history.\r\n\r\nIt was at the time when Réaumur was writing his immortal \"Histoire des\r\nInsectes,\" when Trembley was publishing his admirable researches on\r\nthe freshwater Hydra, whose wonderful vitality we have mentioned in\r\nour work on Zoophytes and Molluscs,[29] that another naturalist\r\nastonished the learned world by his experiments on the reproductions\r\nof plant-lice. This naturalist, whose name will live quite as long as\r\nthose of Réaumur and of Trembley, was Charles Bonnet, of Geneva.\r\n\r\n    [29] \"The Ocean World.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Bonnet made the extraordinary discovery that aphides can\r\nincrease and multiply without the intervention of the sexes. An\r\nisolated specimen can produce a series of generations of its kind. We\r\nwill relate the curious experiments of the Genevese naturalist. He\r\nplaced in a flower-pot, filled with mould, a phial full of water, and\r\nput into this phial a little branch of spindle, having only five or\r\nsix leaves, and perfectly free from any insect. On one of these leaves\r\nhe placed a plant-louse, which was born under his own eyes, of a\r\nwingless mother. He then covered the branch with a glass shade, whose\r\nrim fitted exactly into the top of the flower-pot. Having taken these\r\nprecautions, Charles Bonnet was perfectly certain of being able to\r\nobserve his prisoner at his ease. He could keep it under his eye and\r\nunder his hand, with more certitude and security than was the\r\nmythological Danaë, shut up, by order of Acrisius, in a tower of\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\n\"I took care,\" says Charles Bonnet, \"to keep a correct journal of the\r\nlife of my insect. I noted down its least movements; nothing it did\r\nseemed to me indifferent. Not only did I observe it every day from\r\nhour to hour, beginning generally at four or five o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and only leaving off at about nine or ten at night; but I\r\neven looked many times in the same hour, and always with the\r\nmagnifying glass, to render my observation more exact, and to learn\r\nthe most secret actions of my little lonely one. But if this continual\r\napplication cost me some trouble, and bored me not a little, in amends\r\nI had some cause for self-applause and for having subjected myself to\r\nall this trouble.... My plant-louse changed its skin four times: on\r\nthe 23rd, in the evening; on the 26th, at two in the afternoon; on the\r\n29th, at seven o'clock in the morning; and on the 31st, at about seven\r\no'clock in the evening.... Happily delivered from these four illnesses\r\nthrough which it was obliged to pass, it at last reached that point to\r\nwhich, by my care, I had been trying to bring it. It had become a\r\nperfect plant-louse. On the 1st of June, at about seven o'clock in the\r\nevening, I saw, with great satisfaction, that it had given birth to\r\nanother; from that time I thought I ought to look upon it as a female.\r\nFrom that day up to the 20th inclusive, she produced ninety-five\r\nlittle ones, all alive and doing well, the greatest number of which\r\nwere born under my own eyes!\"[30]\r\n\r\n    [30] \"Traité d'Insectologie, ou Observations sur les Pucerons,\"\r\n    pp. 28-38. 1re partie, 18mo. Paris, 1745.\r\n\r\nHe very soon made some other experiments on the aphis of the\r\nelder-tree, so as to assure himself if the generations of plant-lice,\r\nreared successively in solitude, preserved the same property of\r\nprocreating without copulation.\r\n\r\n\"On the 12th of July,\" says he, \"about three o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nI shut up a plant-louse that had just been born under my eyes. On the\r\n20th of the same month, at six o'clock in the morning, it had already\r\nproduced three little ones. But I waited till the 22nd towards noon\r\nbefore I shut up a plant-louse of the second generation, because I\r\ncould not manage earlier to be present at the birth of one of those\r\nproduced by the mother I had condemned to live in solitude. I always\r\ncontinued to observe the same precaution. I shut up only those\r\nplant-lice which were born under my very eyes. A third generation\r\nbegan on the 1st of August; it was on this day that the plant-louse I\r\nhad shut up on the 22nd of July gave birth to this generation. On the\r\n4th of August, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I put into solitary\r\nconfinement a plant-louse of the third generation. On the ninth of the\r\nsame month, at six in the evening, a fourth generation, due to this\r\nlast one, had already seen the light: it had given birth to four\r\nlittle ones. On the same day, towards midnight, all intercourse with\r\nits own species was forbidden to the plant-louse of the fourth\r\ngeneration born at that hour. On the 18th, between six and seven\r\no'clock in the morning, I found this last in the company of four\r\nlittle ones to which it had given birth.\"[31]\r\n\r\n    [31] \"Traité d'Insectologie,\" &c., pp. 67-69.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the want of food caused the death of the isolated\r\nindividual of the fifth generation, and the experiment was brought to\r\na close.\r\n\r\nBonnet then tried experiments on the plantain aphis, following them up\r\nduring five consecutive generations, which succeeded each other\r\nwithout interruption, in the space of three months.\r\n\r\nAfter having stated the extraordinary facts, which he relates with the\r\nmost perfect simplicity, Charles Bonnet, examining at the end of the\r\nfine season specimens of the winged oak-tree aphis, was able to be\r\npresent at their nuptials. He preserved the females with great care,\r\nand saw, not without profound astonishment, that they gave birth, not\r\nto small living insects, as was the case in the first experiments, but\r\nto eggs of a reddish colour, which were stuck fast to each other, on\r\nthe stem or stalk of the plant.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards, this illustrious observer was able to\r\nconvince himself that the oak-tree plant-lice, whose nuptials he had\r\nwitnessed in the autumn, present the same phenomena of solitary and\r\nviviparous propagation, already so often mentioned by him.\r\n\r\nAt last some new observations permitted him to establish beyond all\r\ndoubt the connection of these facts, in appearance so contradictory.\r\nHe discovered that, during the whole of the fine season, the\r\nplant-lice are solitary and viviparous, but that towards the autumn\r\nthese creatures return to the ordinary course of things, and are\r\npropagated by eggs, whose development requires the co-operation of a\r\nmale and female individual. These eggs are hatched in Spring, and\r\nproduce only viviparous plant-lice. In the autumn the males and\r\nfemales show themselves, and from that moment ovipositing recommences.\r\nThese curious facts, seen and published more than a century ago, have\r\nbeen verified many times since. In 1866 M. Balbiani asserted that the\r\nplant-lice are hermaphrodite, or of both sexes at the same time, which\r\nwould explain the facts observed by Charles Bonnet. But the anatomical\r\nproofs appealed to by Balbiani in support of this idea are far from\r\nestablishing the existence of this arrangement of sexes among them.\r\nThe observations of Charles Bonnet produced profound astonishment\r\namong naturalists, and, in this respect, 1743 may be considered as a\r\nmemorable year.\r\n\r\nThe simple statement of the few experiments which he made, and which\r\nwe have cited, has sufficed to show how rapid is the multiplication of\r\naphides. A single female produced generally 90 young ones; at the\r\nsecond generation these 90 produce 8,100; these give a third\r\ngeneration, which amounts to 729,000 insects; these, in their turn,\r\nbecome 65,610,000; the fifth generation, consisting of 590,490,000,\r\nwill yield a progeny of 53,142,100,000; at the seventh, we shall thus\r\nhave 4,782,789,000,000; and the eighth will give 441,461,010,000,000.\r\nThis immense number increases immeasurably when there are eleven\r\ngenerations in the space of a year. Fortunately a great many\r\ncarnivorous insects wage fierce war against the plant-lice, and\r\ndestroy immense numbers of them. Thus they are kept in check, and\r\nprevented from multiplying inordinately. To show with what prodigious\r\nabundance the reproduction of these little but formidable parasites\r\nmust go on, we will relate a fact which was made known to us by M.\r\nMorren, Professor in the University of Liége.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1833-34 had been extremely warm and dry; whole months\r\nhad passed without any rain. A well-known _savant_, Van Mons, had\r\nforetold, as early as the 12th of May, that all the vegetables would\r\nbe devoured by plant-lice. On the 28th of September, 1834, at the\r\nmoment when the cholera had began to spread its ravages over Belgium,\r\nall of a sudden a swarm of plant-lice showed themselves between Bruges\r\nand Ghent. They were to be seen the next day at Ghent, hovering about\r\nin troops, in such quantities that the daylight was obscured. Standing\r\non the ramparts, one could no longer distinguish the walls of the\r\nhouses in the town, so covered were they with plant-lice. The whole\r\nroad from Antwerp to Ghent was rendered black by innumerable legions\r\nof them. They appeared everywhere quite suddenly. People were\r\nobliged to protect their eyes with spectacles and their faces with\r\nhandkerchiefs, to keep off the painful and disagreeable tickling\r\ncaused by them. The progress of these insects was interrupted by\r\nmountains, hills, even by undulations of land of very slight\r\nelevation, but sufficient to have an influence on the wind. M. Morren\r\nthinks that they came from a great distance, and that they arrived in\r\nBelgium by the sea-coast. Whatever be the explanation of the\r\nphenomenon, it establishes sufficiently the prodigious multiplication\r\nof these little insects.\r\n\r\nThere is another trait, and without doubt the most curious in the\r\nhistory of the aphides, to which we have still to call the attention\r\nof the reader: we mean the relations which exist between them and the\r\nants.\r\n\r\nNo one can have failed to observe ants frequenting those places where\r\nplant-lice are gathered together in great numbers. Are ants simply\r\nfriends of the plant-lice, as thought the ancients? or have their\r\nvisits some selfish object?\r\n\r\nLinnæus, Bonnet, and Pierre Huber thought that the ants did not pay\r\nthese visits for nothing, and that they had some object in view. But\r\nwhat could they want of the plant-lice? It is to Pierre Huber we owe\r\nthe solution of this mystery. This naturalist has made the most\r\nbeautiful observations on the relations which exist between plant-lice\r\nand ants. They are detailed in a chapter of his admirable work,\r\nentitled \"Recherches sur les Moeurs des Fourmis Indigènes.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant-lice have, as we have said, at the extremity of their\r\nabdomen, two small movable horns. These are in communication with a\r\nlittle gland which produces a sugary liquid. When one carefully\r\nobserves plant-lice attached to the stem of a plant, one sees a little\r\nsyrup droplet oozing out of the extremity of these tubes.\r\n\r\nM. Morren, who has made some interesting observations on the anatomy\r\nand generation of the aphis, says that, having shut up females in\r\nwide-mouthed glass bottles, he saw the young, a little time after\r\ntheir birth, suck the sweet juice which exudes from the little tubes\r\nat the extremity of the mother's abdomen. This secretion seems, then,\r\ndestined for the nourishment of the young in the first moments of\r\ntheir existence, before they are able to nourish themselves on\r\nvegetable juices. The saccharine fluid produced by the mother must be,\r\nthen, a sort of milk intended for the nourishment of her young. This\r\nbeing settled, attend to what follows. In all places where plant-lice\r\nare assembled in great numbers it is easy to observe how excessively\r\nfond ants are of the sugary liquid destined for suckling the young.\r\nBut how do the ants manage to get the plant-lice to allow themselves\r\nto be, as we may say, milked?\r\n\r\n\"It had been already noticed,\" says this celebrated observer, \"that\r\nthe ants waited for the moment at which the plant-lice caused this\r\nprecious manna to come out of their abdomen, which they immediately\r\nseized. But I discovered that this was the least of their talents, and\r\nthat they also knew how to manage to be served with this liquid at\r\nwill. This is their secret. A branch of a thistle was covered with\r\nbrown ants and plant-lice. I observed the latter for some time, so as\r\nto discover, if possible, the moment when they caused this secretion\r\nto issue from their bodies; but I remarked that it very rarely came\r\nout of its own accord, and that the plant-lice, which were at some\r\ndistance from the ants, squirted it out with a movement resembling a\r\nkick.\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen, then, that the ants wandering about on the thistle\r\nwere nearly all remarkable for the size of their abdomens, and were\r\nevidently full of some liquid? This I discovered by narrowly watching\r\none ant, whose proceedings I am going to describe minutely. I saw it\r\nat first passing, without stopping, over some plant-lice, which did\r\nnot seem in the least disturbed by its walking over them; but it soon\r\nstopped close to one of the smallest, which it seemed to coax with its\r\nantennæ, touching the extremity of its abdomen very rapidly, first\r\nwith one of its antennæ and then with the other. I saw with surprise\r\nthe liquid come out of the body of the plant-louse, and the ant\r\nforthwith seize upon the droplet and convey it to its mouth. It then\r\nbrought its antennæ to bear upon another plant-louse, much larger\r\nthan the first; this one, caressed in the same manner, yielded the\r\nnourishing fluid from its body in a much larger dose. The ant advanced\r\nand took possession of it. It then passed to a third, which it cajoled\r\nas it had the preceding ones, giving it many little strokes with its\r\nantennæ near the hinder extremity of its body; the liquid came out\r\nimmediately, and the ant picked it up.... A small number of these\r\nrepasts are sufficient to satisfy the ant's appetite. (See Fig. 91.)\r\n\r\n\"It does not appear that it is out of importunity that these insects\r\nobtain their nourishment from the plant-lice.\r\n\r\n\"The neighbourhood of ants is agreeable to plant-lice, since those\r\nwhich could get out of the way of their visits, viz., the winged\r\nplant-lice, prefer to remain amongst them, and to lavish upon them the\r\nsuperabundance of their nourishment.\"[32]\r\n\r\n    [32] \"Recherches sur les Moeurs des Fourmis Indigènes,\" pp.\r\n    181-186. 8vo. Paris, 1810.\r\n\r\nWhat we have just related applies not only to the brown (_Formica\r\nbrunnea_), but also to the tawny ant (_Formica flava_), to the ashy\r\nblack (_Formica nigra_), to the fuliginous (_Formica fuliginosa_), and\r\nto a great many more.\r\n\r\nThe Red Ant (_Formica rufa_) is singularly adroit in seizing the\r\ndroplet left it by the plant-louse. According to Pierre Huber, it\r\nemploys its antennæ, which swell somewhat towards their extremities,\r\nin conveying this droplet to its mouth, and causes it to enter it by\r\npressing it first on one side, then on the other, using its antennæ as\r\nif they were fingers. The greater number of ants seek them on those\r\nplants on which they usually fix themselves--the lowest herbs, as well\r\nas the highest trees. There are some, however, which never leave their\r\nplace of abode, and never go out to the chase. These are the little\r\nants, of a pale yellow colour, rather transparent, and covered with\r\nhairs, and which are extremely numerous in our meadows and orchards.\r\nThese subterranean creatures are very noxious to the farmer. Pierre\r\nHuber often wondered how they subsisted, and with what food they could\r\nprovision themselves, without quitting their gloomy habitations.\r\nHaving one day turned up the earth of which a habitation was composed,\r\nin order to discover if any treasure were to be found stowed away\r\nthere, he found nothing but plant-lice. Of these the greater number\r\nwere fixed to the roots of the trees which hung down from the roof of\r\ntheir subterranean nest; others were wandering about among the ants.\r\nThese latter, moreover, set about milking their nurses, as usual, and\r\nwith the same success. To verify his discovery, he dug up a great\r\nnumber of nests of the yellow ant, and invariably found aphides in\r\nthem. So as to study the relations which must exist between these\r\ninsects, he shut up ants with their friends, the plant-lice, in a\r\nglazed box, placing at the bottom of the box, earth, mixed with the\r\nroots of some plants, whose branches vegetated outside the box. He\r\nwatered this ant-hill from time to time, and thus both the animals and\r\nthe plants found in his apparatus sufficient nourishment.\r\n\r\n\"The ants,\" he says, \"did not endeavour in the least to make their\r\nescape. They seemed to want for nothing, and to be quite content. They\r\ntended their larvæ and females with the same affection they would have\r\nshown in their usual ant-hill; they took great care of the plant-lice,\r\nand never did them any harm. These, on the other hand, did not seem to\r\nfear the ants; they allowed themselves to be moved about from one\r\nplace to another, and when they were set down they remained in the\r\nplace chosen for them by their guardians. When the ants wished to move\r\nthem to a fresh place, they began by caressing them with their\r\nantennæ, as if to request them to abandon their roots or to withdraw\r\ntheir trunk from the cavity in which it was inserted; then they took\r\nthem gently above or below the abdomen with their jaws, and carried\r\nthem with the same care they would have bestowed on the larvæ of their\r\nown species. I saw the same ant take three plant-lice in succession,\r\neach bigger than itself, and carry them away into a dark place....\r\nHowever, the ants do not always act so gently towards them. When they\r\nfear that they may be carried off by ants of another kind, and living\r\nnear their habitation, or when one opens up too suddenly the turf\r\nunder which they are hidden, they seize them up in haste and carry\r\nthem off to the bottom of their little cavern. I have seen the ants of\r\ntwo different ant-hills fighting for their plant-lice. When those\r\nbelonging to one ants' nest could enter the nest of the others, they\r\ntook them away from their rightful owners, and often these took\r\npossession of them again in their turn; for the ants know well the\r\nvalue of these little animals, which seem made on purpose for\r\nthem,--they are the ants' treasures. An ants' nest is more or less\r\nrich, according as it is more or less stocked with plant-lice. The\r\nplant-lice are its cattle, its cows, its goats. One would never have\r\nthought that the ants were a pastoral people!\"[33]\r\n\r\n    [33] \"Recherches,\" &c., pp. 192-194.\r\n\r\nTheir hiding in the ants' nest is not voluntary; they are prisoners of\r\nwar. The ants, after having hollowed out galleries in the midst of\r\nroots, make a foray upon the turf, and seize upon plant-lice scattered\r\nabout here and there, bringing them with them, and collect them\r\ntogether in their nests. The captive insects take their wrongs with\r\npatience, and behave like philosophers under this new kind of life.\r\nThey lavish on their masters, with the best grace in the world, the\r\nnutritious juices with which their bodies superabound. Charles Bonnet\r\nhas stated some real wonders of the cleverness and industry of other\r\nants which also make a provision of plant-lice.\r\n\r\n\"I discovered one day,\" says he, \"a Euphorbia, which supported in the\r\nmiddle of its stem a small sphere, to which it served as the axis. It\r\nwas a case which the ants had constructed of earth. They issued forth\r\nfrom this by a very narrow opening made in its base, descended the\r\nstem, and passed into a neighbouring ants' nest. I destroyed one part\r\nof this pavilion, built almost in the air, so that I might study the\r\ninterior. It was a little room, the vault-shaped walls of which were\r\nsmooth and even. The ants had profited by the form of the plant to\r\nsustain their edifice. The stalk passed up the centre of the\r\napartment, and for its timber-work it had the leaves. This retreat\r\ncontained a numerous family of plant-lice, to which the brown ants\r\ncame peacefully, to make their harvest, sheltered from the rain, the\r\nsun, and from other ants. No insect could disturb them; and the\r\nplant-lice were not exposed to the attacks of their numerous enemies.\r\nI admired this trait of industry; and I was not long in finding it\r\nagain, in a more interesting character, in ants of different species.\r\n\r\n\"Some red ants had built round the foot of a thistle a tube of earth,\r\ntwo inches and a half long by one and a half broad. The ants' nest was\r\nbelow, and communicated directly with the cylinder. I took the stalk,\r\nwith what surrounded it, and all that the cylinder contained. That\r\nportion of the stem which was inside the earthen tube was covered with\r\nplant-lice. I very soon saw the ants coming out at the opening I had\r\nmade at the base; they were very much astonished to see daylight at\r\nthat place, and I saw that they lived there with their larvæ. They\r\ncarried these with great haste to the highest part of the cylinder\r\nwhich had not been altered. In this retreat they were within reach of\r\ntheir plant-lice, and here they fed their young.\r\n\r\n\"In other places many stalks of the Euphorbia laden with plant-lice\r\nrose in the very centre of an ant-hill belonging to the brown ants.\r\nThese insects, profiting by the peculiar arrangement of the leaves of\r\nthis plant, had constructed round each branch as many little elongated\r\ncases; and it was here they came to get their food. Having destroyed\r\none of these cells, the ants forthwith carried off into their nests\r\ntheir precious animals; a few days afterwards it was repaired under my\r\neyes by these insects, and the herd were taken back to their pens.\r\n\r\n\"These cases are not always at a few inches from the ground. I saw one\r\nfive feet above the soil, and this one deserves also to be described.\r\nIt consisted of a blackish, rather short tube, which was built round a\r\nsmall branch of the poplar at the point where it left the trunk. The\r\nants reached it by the interior of the tree, which was excavated, and\r\nwithout showing themselves, they were able to reach their plant-lice\r\nby an opening which they had made in the base of this branch. This\r\ntube was formed of rotten wood, of the vegetable earth of this very\r\ntree, and I saw many a time the ants bringing little bits in their\r\nmouths to repair the breaches I had made in their pavilion. These are\r\nnot very common traits, and are not of the number of those which can\r\nbe attributed to an habitual routine.\"[34]\r\n\r\n    [34] \"Traité d'Insectologie,\" &c., pp. 198-201.\r\n\r\nOne day, Pierre Huber discovered in a nest of yellow ants a cell\r\ncontaining a mass of eggs having the appearance of ebony. They were\r\nsurrounded by a number of ants, which appeared to be guarding them,\r\nand endeavouring to carry them off.\r\n\r\nHuber took possession of the cell, its inhabitants, and of the little\r\ntreasure it contained, and placed the whole in a box lid, covered with\r\na piece of glass, so as to be more easily observed. He saw the ants\r\napproach the eggs, pass their tongues in between them, depositing on\r\nthem a liquid. They seemed to treat these eggs exactly as they would\r\nhave treated those of their own species; they felt them with their\r\nantennæ, gathered them together, raised them frequently to their\r\nmouths, and did not leave them for an instant. They took them up, and\r\nturned them over, and after having examined them with care, they\r\ncarried them with extreme delicacy into the little box of earth placed\r\nnear them.[35]\r\n\r\n    [35] \"Recherches,\" &c., pp. 205, 206.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--Aphides and Ant (magnified).]\r\n\r\nThese were not, however, ants' eggs. They were the eggs of aphides.\r\nThe young which were soon to be hatched were to give to the provident\r\nants a reward for the attentions they had lavished upon them. How\r\nwonderful are the life and the habits of the plant-lice, and their\r\nrelations to ants! But we should be led on too far, if we were to\r\npursue these attractive details.\r\n\r\nWe pass on now to the history of another family--namely, the\r\n_Gallinsecta_, as Réaumur calls them, or _Cocci_. They pass the\r\ngreatest part of their lives--that is to say, many months--entirely\r\nmotionless, sticking to the stalks or branches of shrubs; remaining\r\nthus as devoid of movement as the plant to which they are attached.\r\nOne would say that they were part and parcel of it. Their form is so\r\nsimple, that nothing in their exterior would make one guess them to be\r\ninsects. The larger they become the less they resemble living things.\r\nWhen the coccus is in a state for multiplying its species, when it is\r\nengaged in laying its thousands of eggs, it resembles only an\r\nexcrescence of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe Gallinsecta are found on the elm, the oak, the lime, the alder,\r\nthe holly, the orange-tree, and the oleander. Some of the species are\r\nremarkable for the beautiful red colouring matter which they furnish.\r\nSuch are the _Coccus cacti_, the _Chermes variegatus_, or Oak Tree\r\nCochineal, and the _Coccus polonicus_.\r\n\r\nThe Common Cochineal, _Coccus cacti_, is found in Mexico, on the\r\nNopal, or prickly pear (_Opuntia_), particularly on the _Opuntia\r\nvulgaris_, the _Opuntia coccifera_, and the _Opuntia una_, plants\r\nwhich belong to the family of the Cactaceæ.\r\n\r\nThese insects are rather remarkable, in that the male and female are\r\nso unlike, that one would take them for animals of different genera.\r\n\r\nThe male presents an elongated, depressed body, of a dark-brown red.\r\nIts head small, furnished with two long feathery antennæ, has only a\r\nrudimentary beak. The abdomen is terminated by two fine hairs, longer\r\nthan its body. The wings, perfectly transparent, reach beyond the\r\nextremity of its abdomen, and cross each other horizontally over its\r\nback. It is lively and active. The female presents quite a different\r\nappearance. It is in the first place twice as large as the male (Fig.\r\n92), convex above, flat below. It resembles a larva, and has no wings.\r\nIts body is formed of a dozen segments, covered with a glaucous dust.\r\nThe beak is very fully developed, and the two hairs or bristles on the\r\nabdomen are much shorter than in the male.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Cochineal insects, (_Coccus cacti_) male and\r\nfemale.]\r\n\r\nThe weight of the body, combined with the shortness of the legs,\r\nprevents these creatures from being active. The legs only serve, in\r\nfact, for clinging to the vegetable from which they draw their\r\nnourishment. The circumstances attending the birth of the cochineal\r\ninsect are very curious. The larvæ are born in the dried-up body of\r\ntheir dead mother, the skeleton of their mother serving them as a\r\ncradle. This happens thus:--The eggs are attached to the lower part of\r\nthe mother's body. When the abdomen of the mother is empty, its lower\r\nside draws up towards the upper side, and the two together form a\r\npretty large cavity. When the mother dies, which is not long in\r\nhappening, her abdomen dries up, her skin becomes horny, and forms a\r\nsort of shell. It is in this membranous cradle that the larvæ of the\r\ncochineal insect are born. The cochineal insect in its wild state\r\nlives in the woods. But it can without difficulty be reared\r\nartificially.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that the little insect called the cochineal,\r\nfurnishes, when its body has been dried and reduced to powder, a\r\ncolouring matter of a beautiful red, peculiar to itself. This\r\ncircumstance has saved the cochineal from the persecution to which so\r\nmany other kinds of insects have been devoted by the hand of man. In\r\nhot climates, in which the cochineal insect delights, it has been\r\npreserved, and is cultivated as an article of commerce. This is how\r\nthe cochineal is reared in Mexico:--An open piece of land is chosen,\r\nprotected against the west wind, and of about one or two acres in\r\nextent. This is surrounded with a hedge of reeds, planted in lines,\r\ndistant from each other about a yard, with cuttings of cactus at most\r\nabout two feet apart. The cactus garden made, the next thing is to\r\nestablish in it cochineals. With this object in view they are sought\r\nin the woods, or else the females of the cochineal insect which are\r\npregnant are taken off plants which have been sheltered during the\r\nwinter, and placed in dozens, in nests made of cocoa-nut fibres, or in\r\nlittle plaited baskets made of the leaves of the dwarf palm, and hung\r\non the prickles of the cactus. These are very soon covered with young\r\nlarvæ. The only thing now required to be done is to shelter them from\r\nwind and rain. (PLATE IV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV. Gathering Cochineal in Algeria.]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ are changed into perfect insects, which take up their abode\r\npermanently on the branches of the cacti, as Fig. 93 represents. The\r\nMexicans gather them as soon as they have reached the perfect state.\r\nThe harvest cannot be difficult, considering the immobility of these\r\nlittle creatures. When collected, the cochineals are killed, packed in\r\nwooden boxes, and sent to Europe, to be used in dyeing.\r\n\r\nSuch is the method, very simple, as we see, of rearing the\r\ncochineal--a method which has been followed for centuries in Mexico.\r\nTowards the end of the year 1700, a Frenchman named Thierry de\r\nMenouville, formed the project of taking this precious insect away\r\nfrom the Spaniards, and of bestowing it upon the French colonies. He\r\nlanded in Mexico, and concealed so well the object of his voyage, that\r\nhe managed to embark and carry to St. Domingo several cases containing\r\nplants covered with living cochineals. Unfortunately, a revolution\r\nwhich had broken out at St. Domingo prevented him from succeeding in\r\nhis praiseworthy endeavours. The cochineals died, and the Spaniards\r\npreserved their monopoly in the rearing of this insect.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 M. Souceylier, a surgeon in the French navy, succeeded in\r\nbringing from Mexico into Europe some live cochineals. He gave them to\r\nthe professor of botany at Toulon; but this attempt to preserve them\r\nwas unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 the naturalisation of the cochineal was attempted in Corsica,\r\nbut without success. During the same year the cochineal was introduced\r\ninto the Canary Islands, but the inhabitants did not understand the\r\nimportance of the experiment. They counted the cochineal among the\r\nnumber of noxious insects, and tried in all ways to rid themselves of\r\nit. It was only after results obtained by some more intelligent\r\nfarmers, that the inhabitants of the Canary Islands perceived the\r\nprofits they might derive. From that time its cultivation was\r\nextended, and after the year 1831 it increased rapidly. Thus, the\r\ncochineal imported from the Canary Isles in that year amounted to\r\nonly 4 kilogrammes. In 1832 the amount was 60 kilogrammes, in 1833\r\nit was 660 kilogrammes, in 1838, 9,000 kilogrammes, and in 1850,\r\n400,000 kilogrammes. The French colonists in Algeria also tried to\r\nraise it. In 1831, M. Limonnet, a chemist of Algiers, collected some\r\ncochineals, and had the merit of first introducing the insect into the\r\ncolony. On account of bad weather these first essays were fruitless,\r\nbut it was not long before they were repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--Branch of the Cactus, with Cochineal Insects on.]\r\n\r\nM. Loze, surgeon in the navy, undertook to introduce the insect again,\r\nand, with M. Hardy, director of the central garden of Algiers, gave\r\nhimself up, with great intelligence, to the naturalisation and rearing\r\nof the cochineal in Algeria.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 the French Minister of War, for the purpose of having the\r\nvalue of the Algerian cochineal fixed by commerce, caused to be sold\r\npublicly on the market-place of Marseilles a case of cochineal, the\r\nproduce of the harvests of 1845 and 1846, from the experimental garden\r\nof Algiers, and which contained 17 kilogrammes of this commodity.\r\nSince that time the cultivation of this insect, the beginning of which\r\nwas due to M. Limonnet, has rapidly developed. In 1853, in the\r\nprovince of Algiers alone, there were fourteen _nopaleries_, or cactus\r\ngardens, containing 61,500 plants. The Government at that time bought\r\nthe harvests for fifteen francs the kilogramme.\r\n\r\nWe have only pointed out in a general way how the cochineal harvest is\r\nconducted. We will now enter into some details on the subject. These\r\ninsects are gathered when the females are about to lay, that is, when\r\na few young are hatched. It is when the females are pregnant that they\r\ncontain the greatest amount of colouring matter. When the harvest time\r\nhas arrived, the rearers stretch out on the ground pieces of linen at\r\nthe foot of the plants, and detach the cochineals from them, brushing\r\nthe plants with a rather hard brush, or scraping them off with the\r\nblade of a blunt knife.\r\n\r\nIf the season is favourable, the operation may be repeated three times\r\nin the course of a year in the same plantation. The insects thus\r\ncollected are killed, by dipping into boiling water, by being put into\r\nan oven, or by being placed on a plate of hot iron. The cochineals,\r\nwhen withdrawn from the boiling water, are placed upon drainers, first\r\nin the sun, then in the shade, then in an airy place. During their\r\nimmersion in water they lose the white powder which covers them. In\r\nthis state they are called in Mexico _ronagridas_. Those which have\r\npassed through the oven they call _jaspeadas_, and are of an ashy\r\ngrey; those that are torrefied are black, and are called _negras_. In\r\ncommerce three sorts of cochineal are recognised; first, the\r\n_mastique_ (_mestèque_), of a reddish colour, with a more or less\r\nabundant glaucous powder; secondly, the _noire_, which is large and of\r\na blackish brown; thirdly, the _sylvestre_, which is, on the contrary,\r\nsmaller and reddish. The latter is the least esteemed, and is gathered\r\non wild cacti.\r\n\r\nEach year there are imported into France 200,000 kilogrammes of\r\ncochineals, which represents a value of about three millions of\r\nfrancs. Every one knows that it is from cochineal that carmine is\r\nmade, a magnificent red frequently employed by painters. Lake carmine\r\nis another product obtained from the cochineal. And, lastly, scarlet\r\nis the powder of the cochineal precipitated by a salt of tin.\r\n\r\nBefore the Mexican cochineal was known in Europe, the _kermes_, or\r\n_Coccus ilicis_, known still in commerce and by chemists under the\r\nnames of _Animal kermes_, _Vegetable kermes_, and _Scarlet seed_, was\r\nused for the preparation of the carmine employed in the arts. This\r\ncochineal lives by preference (at least, so it is supposed) on the\r\nevergreen oak (_Quercus ilex_), whence its specific name.\r\n\r\nThe _Coccus ilicis_ develops itself almost exclusively, not on the\r\nevergreen oak, but on the _Quercus coccifera_, or kermes oak, a shrub\r\ncommon in dry arid places on the Continent, and which vegetates on a\r\ngreat number of spots in the Mediterranean, particularly on the\r\n_garrigues_, or waste land, of Herault.\r\n\r\nThe females of this insect, which, dried, bear the name of _graines de\r\nkermes_, are of the size of an ordinary currant, without any trace of\r\nrings, nearly spherical, of a violet and glaucous colour. They adhere\r\nto the boughs of the shrub _Quercus coccifera_, and form dry brittle\r\nmasses, which the peasants of the south of France collect, and sell at\r\na tolerably high price.\r\n\r\nBefore we possessed the cochineal of Mexico and of Algeria, this\r\ncochineal was very much employed in the south of Europe, in the East,\r\nand in Africa. It furnishes a beautiful red colour. This last named\r\nand the Mexican cochineal are somewhat used in pharmacy. They enter\r\ninto alkermes, a sort of liquor served at dinner in Italy, chiefly at\r\nFlorence and Naples.\r\n\r\nAnother species of cochineal is the _Coccus polonicus_, which is met\r\nwith in Poland and Russia, more rarely in France, on the roots of a\r\nsmall plant, the _Scleranthus perennis_. This cochineal is gathered in\r\nthe Ukraine towards the end of June, when the abdomen of the female is\r\nswollen, and filled with a purple and sanguineous juice.\r\n\r\nThe Polish kermes (_Coccus polonicus_) was formerly used very much in\r\nEurope. This product has not indeed lost all its importance in those\r\ncountries where it is met with in abundance.\r\n\r\nWe have now only to point out among the insects of this group the\r\n_Coccus lacca_, which lives in India on many trees, among others on\r\nthe Indian fig-tree, the Pagoda fig-tree, the Jujube tree, on the\r\nCroton, &c.\r\n\r\nThese last-mentioned insects produce a colouring matter known under\r\nthe name of Lac Dye. They fix themselves on the little branches,\r\ngetting together in great numbers, forming nearly straight lines. The\r\nbodies of many fecundated females, united together by a resinous\r\nexudation which is caused by the piercing of the bark, constitutes the\r\nmatter called in commerce and by dyers by the name of Lac Dye,\r\nShell-lac, Gum-lac, &c.\r\n\r\nResinous lac is found in commerce under four forms:--First, the\r\nstick-lac, such as it is found concreted at the extremity of the\r\nbranches whence it exudes--it is an irregular brownish crust;\r\nsecondly, the seed-lac, picked off the branches and pounded; thirdly,\r\nshell-lac in scales melted down and run into thin plates, which vary\r\nin quality according to the proportion of colouring matter they\r\ncontain; fourthly, thread-lac, which resembles reddish threads, and is\r\nprepared thus in India.\r\n\r\nOne more word about the cochineal. The _Coccus manniparus_, which\r\nlives on the shrubs (_Tamarix mannifera_) on Mount Sinai, causes to\r\nexude from the branches it has pierced a sort of manna. The _Coccus\r\nsinensis_ produces a kind of wax which is employed in China in the\r\nmanufacture of candles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nLEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis order of insects is known popularly by the names of Butterfly and\r\nMoth. Linnæus gave them the name of _Lepidoptera_, meaning insects\r\nwith scaly wings ([Greek: lepis], a scale; and [Greek: pteron], a\r\nwing). They are to be found in great numbers in all parts of the\r\nworld. All the insects contained in the order are, in their perfect\r\nstate, remarkable for the elegance of their shape, the rapidity and\r\nairiness of their flight, and the multiplicity and beauty of their\r\ncolours. Before they arrive at this perfect state, the Lepidoptera\r\nhave to undergo three complete transformations. They leave the egg in\r\nthe larva or caterpillar state; they pass next to the state of pupa,\r\nor chrysalis; they then assume, after a variable time, their final or\r\nperfect form. We will study them in their three different states in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARVA, OR CATERPILLAR.\r\n\r\nWhen the winter has stripped the leaves off the trees, the Lepidoptera\r\nare seen no more; but as soon as the leaves begin to show themselves\r\non the trees and shrubs, this tribe of the insect race again makes its\r\nappearance. Caterpillars of all kinds are gnawing at the leaves, even\r\nbefore they are fully developed. Many of them have just emerged from\r\nthe eggs which the perfect insects had laid at an earlier period;\r\nothers have passed the winter in this state.\r\n\r\nWhen they come out of the egg the young caterpillars are in shape more\r\nor less elongated and cylindrical. Their body is composed of twelve\r\nsegments, or rings. In front is the head; then come three segments, on\r\nwhich are the front legs, and which constitute the thorax; the other\r\nsegments constitute the abdomen. The head is formed of two scaly\r\nparts. It is often very deeply hollowed out on its upper side, and\r\ndivided into two lobes, which contain in the angle formed by their\r\nseparation the different parts of the mouth. The head is uniform,\r\nrarely having, so far as our caterpillars are concerned, any\r\nprotuberance; but in the tropical species it is often armed with\r\nprickles, spikes, and extraordinary appendages. They are provided with\r\nsix small simple eyes, isolated from each other. The mouth is armed\r\nlaterally with a pair of very solid horny mandibles, articulated by\r\nmeans of vigorous muscles, and moving horizontally. It is the function\r\nof the mandibles, as with the jaws, to divide the creature's food. On\r\nthe middle of a broad under-lip one may perceive a little elongated\r\ntubular organ, pierced with a microscopic orifice. This organ is the\r\nspinning apparatus, which the animal uses in fabricating the threads\r\nwhich it will one day require. It is a tube composed of longitudinal\r\nfibres. It presents only one orifice, cut obliquely, and capable of\r\napplying itself exactly to the body on which the larva is placed. From\r\nthe contractile nature of this organ and the form of its orifice,\r\ncombined with the faculty the insect possesses of moving it in all\r\ndirections, result the great differences we observe in the diameter\r\nand form of the threads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Scaly legs of the Caterpillar of the Gipsy\r\nMoth (_Liparis dispar_).]\r\n\r\nThe external organs of the trunk and abdomen are the legs, the\r\nspiracles, and various occasional appendages. The legs are of two\r\ndifferent kinds. The one, to the number of six, attached by pairs to\r\nthe trunk, are covered with a shiny cartilage, and armed with hooks.\r\nThese are the true legs. Fig. 94 represents, after Réaumur's \"Mémoire\r\nsur les Différentes Parties des Chenilles,\"[36] the scaly legs of the\r\ncaterpillar of the Gipsy Moth. The others are membranous, fleshy,\r\ngenerally conical or cylindrical, contractile, and taking, according\r\nto the will of the animal, very different forms. Fig. 95 represents,\r\nafter the same Memoir of Réaumur's, the different forms of the\r\nmembranous legs of the silkworm caterpillar. This plate gives a\r\nsufficiently good idea of the shape of these organs, and of the\r\nhooks, circular or semi-circular, with which they are furnished.\r\n\r\n    [36] Tome i., p. 164; Plate III., Figs. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Membranous legs of the Silkworm (_Bombyx mori_).]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 96 are represented, after the same author, two membranous legs\r\nof a large caterpillar, of which the hooks of the feet are fastened\r\ninto a branch of a shrub.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--Membranous legs of a large Caterpillar\r\nembracing a twig.]\r\n\r\nCaterpillars have from two to ten false legs, the scaly legs being\r\nalways six in number. The pro-legs, as the fleshy ones are called, are\r\ndivided into _hinder_ and _intermediate_. The former are two in\r\nnumber; the intermediate are rarely more than eight in number.\r\n\r\nIn the caterpillars which have the full number of legs--that is to\r\nsay, sixteen--there are two empty spaces, where the body has no\r\nsupport: the one between the legs and the pro-legs, formed by the\r\nfourth and fifth segment; the other, between the intermediate pro-legs\r\nand the anal legs, formed by the tenth and eleventh ring.\r\n\r\nThe variations which caterpillars present, so far as the number and\r\nsituations of their pro-legs are concerned, are the following:--\r\n\r\nThe greatest number among them have ten pro-legs; others have only\r\neight; others only six--these may be called semi-loopers; others only\r\nfour, one pair being situated on the last ring, and the other on the\r\nninth, as in the case of looper caterpillars. And, lastly, there are\r\nothers which have only two pro-legs.\r\n\r\nThe various forms, numbers, and positions of these organs, produce\r\ngreat differences in the mode of locomotion of caterpillars. Those\r\nprovided with ten or eight membranous legs have in walking only a very\r\nslight undulating motion. Their bodies are parallel to the plane which\r\nsupports them. They can walk very quickly; but their steps are short\r\nand quickly repeated. Others, on the contrary, in proportion as the\r\nnumber of their false legs diminish, and the spaces between the legs\r\nincrease, walk in a more irregular and quaint manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--Looper Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--Caterpillar curved into an arch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--Caterpillar at full length.]\r\n\r\nIf the reader will glance at Fig. 97, taken from Réaumur's \"Mémoire\r\nsur les Chenilles en général,\"[37] which represents a looper\r\ncaterpillar, with four membranous legs, he will see that there is a\r\nconsiderable space between the posterior legs and the first pair of\r\npro-legs, along which the body has no points of support. If one of\r\nthese caterpillars, lying quiet and at full length, determines to\r\nwalk, in order to take its first step (Fig. 98) it begins by humping\r\nits back, curving into an arch that part which has no legs, and\r\nfinishes by assuming the position seen in Fig. 99. In the former\r\nposition it has its two intermediate legs against the posterior legs,\r\nand, in consequence, it has brought forward the hinder part of its\r\nbody, a distance equal to the interval of the five segments which\r\nseparate them. There it hooks on by its _intermediate_ and _hind_\r\nlegs. Then it has only to raise and straighten the five rings which\r\nhad formed the loop, and to advance its head to a distance equal to\r\nthe length of five segments. The step is thus made, the caterpillar\r\nmaking the same movements in taking the second and following steps.\r\n\r\n    [37] Tome i., p. 49, Plate I., Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nThis sort of gait has gained for them the name of Geometers, because\r\nthey seem to measure the road over which they travel. When they make a\r\nstep, they apply the part of their body which they have just curved up\r\nto the ground, in exactly the same way as a land surveyor applies his\r\nchain to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--Caterpillar of the Canary-shouldered Thorn\r\n(_Eugonia alniaria_).]\r\n\r\nThese looper caterpillars cannot shorten nor lengthen their segments\r\nat will, as other caterpillars, but only bend their bodies. There are\r\nmany species whose bodies are cylindrical, stiff, and of the same\r\ncolour as bark. Their attitudes deceive even the close observer. They\r\nembrace the stem of a leaf or twig with their hinder and intermediate\r\nlegs, whilst the rest of their body, vertically elevated, remains\r\nstiff and immovable for hours together. Fig. 100 shows the caterpillar\r\nof the Canary-shouldered Thorn (_Eugonia alniaria_) in this strange\r\nposition. Now, this is a feat of strength which the most skilful of\r\nour acrobats, ordinary and extraordinary, which all the Leotards of\r\nthe present day, and those who are to succeed them, can never\r\naccomplish. With such a persistency, this caterpillar can sustain its\r\nbody in the air for a considerable time, in all the positions\r\nimaginable, between the vertical and the horizontal, and downwards\r\nagain in any incline from the horizontal to the vertical. \"If one\r\nconsiders,\" says Réaumur, \"how far we are from having in the muscles\r\nof our arms a force capable of supporting us in such attitudes as\r\nthese, we must own that the power of the muscles in these insects is\r\nprodigious.\"\r\n\r\nWe will not dwell now on the variableness of the length of the body of\r\ncaterpillars; on the fleshy appendages which are to be observed on\r\nthem; on the hairs which either beautify or render them hideous,\r\naccording to the fancy of the observer; nor on the various colours\r\nwith which they are decorated. We will notice these various\r\ncharacteristics when giving the history of some species of remarkable\r\nLepidoptera.\r\n\r\nMany caterpillars are solitary; others live in companies more or less\r\nnumerous, either when young, or during the whole of their existence.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a great number of moths, which live at the\r\nexpense of our furs, or woollen stuffs, and leather or fatty matters,\r\nall caterpillars feed on plants. From the root to the seeds, no part\r\nof the vegetable is safe from their attacks. The greatest number of\r\nthe species, however, prefer the leaves. Those of the most acrid and\r\npoisonous are no more spared than those of the most harmless plants.\r\nThere are caterpillars which eat the leaves of the Euphorbia, or\r\nspurge, for instance.\r\n\r\n\"I wished to try,\" says Réaumur, \"the milk of this plant on my tongue.\r\nIt produced hardly any effect upon it at first; but after a quarter of\r\nan hour I found my mouth on fire, and it was a heat which reiterated\r\ngarglings with water during many hours in succession could not quench.\r\nThis continued till the next day. The heat passed successively from\r\none part of my mouth to another. I, however, saw many of my\r\ncaterpillars drinking greedily the great drops of milk which were at\r\nthe end of the broken stem I had presented to them.\"\r\n\r\nIs it not extraordinary that there are caterpillars which live on the\r\nnettle?--that they eat the leaves of this plant, armed as it is with\r\nstinging bristles, which cause such smarting and itching to the skin,\r\nand produce blisters upon it.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that each plant has its own peculiar species of\r\ncaterpillar. All we can say is, that a certain number of vegetables\r\nonly suit certain caterpillars. The species which eat roots are few;\r\nthose which live in the interior of stalks or stems which they feed\r\non are numerous, and those which nourish themselves on the pulp of\r\nfruits are rare. In general, after the leaves, the caterpillars prefer\r\nthe flowers: in this they certainly do not show bad taste. Their\r\ngrowth is more or less rapid, according to the species, according to\r\nthe nourishment they take, and according to the season of the year.\r\nThose whose food is succulent grow more rapidly than those which have\r\nfor their food dry gramineous plants and coriaceous lichens. Most of\r\nthem eat at night, and remain during the day motionless, and as it\r\nwere in a state of torpor; others are so voracious that they are\r\nconstantly eating. This voracity is indeed sometimes surprising.\r\nMalpighi has observed that a silkworm often eats in a day mulberry\r\nleaves equal to its own weight. How could we provide our horses and\r\noxen with provender, if they required each day their own weight of hay\r\nand grass? There are even some caterpillars which are still more\r\nvoracious than that. Réaumur weighed several caterpillars of a species\r\nwhich lives on the cabbage, and gave them bits of cabbage-leaves which\r\nweighed twice as much as their bodies. In less than twenty-four hours\r\nthey had entirely consumed them. In this space of time their weight\r\nincreased one-tenth. Fancy a man whose weight is 180 lbs. eating in\r\none day 360 lbs. of meat, and gaining 18 lbs. in weight! Caterpillars\r\neat by the aid of two jaws or mandibles so broad and solid that,\r\nconsidering the smallness of the insect, they are equivalent to all\r\nthe teeth with which large animals are furnished. It is by the\r\nalternate movement of these mandibles that the caterpillars devour the\r\nleaves with so much greediness and ease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--Looper Caterpillar eating the leaves of the\r\nApricot (after Réaumur).]\r\n\r\n\"A caterpillar, when it wants to gnaw the edge of a leaf,\" says\r\nRéaumur, \"twists its body in such a way that at least one portion of\r\nthe edge of this leaf is passed between its legs. These legs hold fast\r\nthat portion of the leaf which is to be cut by the insect's jaws (Fig.\r\n101). To give the first bite the caterpillar elongates its body, and\r\ncarries its head as far forward as possible. The portion of the leaf\r\nwhich is between the open jaws is cut through the instant the teeth\r\nmeet each other; the bites succeed each other quickly; there is not\r\none, or scarcely one of them, that does not detach a bit, and each bit\r\nis swallowed almost as soon as cut off. At each fresh bite the head\r\napproaches the legs in such a way that during the succession of bites\r\nit describes an arc; it hollows out the portion of the leaf in a\r\nsegment of a circle, and it is always in this order that it gnaws it.\"\r\n\r\nBut there is a phenomenon in the life of caterpillars which we ought\r\nto point out, and which has attracted the attention of the most\r\nillustrious observers. All caterpillars change their skins many times\r\nduring their life. It is not, indeed, enough to say that they change\r\ntheir skins; the skins or cases they cast are so complete that they\r\nmight be taken for entire caterpillars. The hairs, the case of the\r\nlegs, the claws with which the legs are provided, the hard and solid\r\nparts which cover the head, the jaws--all these are found in the skin\r\nwhich the insect abandons. What an operation for the poor little\r\nanimal! This labour is so enormous, so troublesome, that one cannot\r\nform a just idea of it. One or two days before this grand crisis, the\r\ncaterpillar leaves off eating, loses its usual activity, and becomes\r\nmotionless and languid. Their colour fades, their skin dries little by\r\nlittle, they bow their backs, swell out their segments. At last this\r\ndried-up skin splits below the back, on the second or third ring, and\r\nlets us have a glimpse of a small portion of the new skin, easily to\r\nbe recognised by the freshness and brightness of its colours.\r\n\r\n\"When once the split has been begun,\" says Réaumur, \"it is easy for\r\nthe insect to extend it; it continues to swell out that part of its\r\nbody which is opposite the slit. Very soon this part raises itself\r\nabove the sides of the split; it does the work of a wedge, which\r\nelongates it; thus the split soon extends from the end or the\r\ncommencement of the first ring as far as the other side of the end of\r\nthe fourth. The upper portion of the body which corresponds to these\r\nfour rings is then laid bare, and the caterpillar has an opening\r\nsufficiently large to serve it as an egress through which it can\r\nentirely leave its old skin. It curves its fore part, and draws it\r\nbackwards; by this movement it disengages its head from under its old\r\nenvelope, and brings it up to the beginning of the slit; at once it\r\nraises it, and puts it out through this slit. The moment afterwards it\r\nstretches out its fore part and lowers its head. There now remains for\r\nthe caterpillar nothing but to draw its hinder part from the old\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nThis excessively laborious operation is finished in less than a\r\nminute. The new livery which the caterpillar has just put on is fresh\r\nand bright in colour. But the animal is exhausted by its fast, and the\r\nefforts which it has made. It requires a few hours in which to regain\r\nits equilibrium, and at the same time its former activity and\r\nvoracity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRYSALIS, OR PUPA.\r\n\r\nHaving attained its full development, the caterpillar ceases to eat,\r\nas at the approach of a moult, it empties its intestinal canal by\r\ncopious ejections; it loses its colours, and becomes dull and livid,\r\nand thus prepares itself to enter a new phase of its existence.\r\n\r\nSome, when about to transform themselves into chrysalides, suspend\r\nthemselves to foreign bodies. Others spin a cocoon, composed of silk\r\nand other substances, which secures them against the attacks of their\r\nenemies and the action of the atmosphere. Those which suspend\r\nthemselves can be divided under two heads, according to the mode of\r\ntheir suspension:--1. Those which suspend themselves perpendicularly\r\nby the tail. 2. Those which, after having fixed themselves by the same\r\npart, suspend themselves horizontally, by means of a silk thread\r\npassed round the body.\r\n\r\nTo understand the difficulty which the first of these operations\r\npresents, we must consider the problem which the caterpillar has to\r\nsolve. In this problem there are two unknown quantities to be\r\ndiscovered. Firstly, the caterpillar must suspend itself firmly; and\r\nsecondly, the pupa, having no communication with the object which\r\nsupports it, must be suspended in the same manner. This problem is\r\ndifficult, apparently impossible, to solve. It is only by watching\r\nthese insects at work that one can discover the wonderful mysteries of\r\ntheir lives. Swammerdam, Valisnieri, and other observers who have\r\nstudied insects, had not, however, observed the manoeuvres of\r\ncaterpillars in this curious phase of their existence. It is to\r\nRéaumur again that science is indebted for the most charming and\r\nvaluable observations on this point. He got together a great number of\r\ncaterpillars of the small Tortoise-shell Butterfly (_Vanessa urticæ_),\r\nblack prickly caterpillars which are common on the stinging-nettle,\r\nwhere they live in companies, and suspend themselves by the tail. When\r\nthe time approaches at which the caterpillars of this species ought to\r\nundergo their transformations, they usually leave the plant which had\r\nup to that time served them as food. After having wandered about a\r\nlittle, they select some convenient spot, where they hang themselves\r\nup head downwards (Figs. 102, 103).\r\n\r\nIn order to hang itself in this way, the caterpillar begins by\r\ncovering, with threads drawn in different directions, a pretty large\r\nextent of the surface of the body against which it wishes to fix\r\nitself. After having covered it thus with a kind of thin cobweb, it\r\nadds different layers of threads on a small portion of this surface,\r\nin such a manner that the upper one is always smaller than that upon\r\nwhich it is laid. In this manner a small hillock of silk is formed,\r\nthe tissue of which is not at all compact. It resembles an assemblage\r\nof loose or badly interwoven threads. The membranous feet of the\r\ncaterpillar are armed with hooks of different lengths, with the aid of\r\nwhich it suspends itself. By alternately contracting and elongating\r\nits body, it pushes its hindermost legs against the hillock of silk,\r\npresses against it the hooks of its feet, so as to get them better\r\nentangled, and lets its body fall in a vertical position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 102, 103.--Caterpillars of the small\r\nTortoise-shell Butterfly (_Vanessa urticæ_) undergoing their\r\nmetamorphoses.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 104, 105.--Chrysalides of the small\r\nTortoise-shell Butterfly freeing themselves from the Caterpillar skin.]\r\n\r\nIt remains hanging thus, often for twenty-four hours, during which\r\ntime it is occupied in a difficult task, that of splitting its skin.\r\nIn order to effect this, it incessantly curves and recurves its body\r\n(Fig. 102), until at last a split appears on the skin of the back, and\r\nthrough this split emerges a part of the body of the chrysalis. This\r\nacts as a wedge, and little by little the split widens from the head\r\nto the last of the true legs, and beyond them. Then the opening is\r\nsufficient to allow of the chrysalis drawing out its anterior portion\r\nfrom the envelope, which it immediately does. To set itself entirely\r\nfree, the chrysalis lengthens and shortens itself alternately (Fig.\r\n105). Each time that it shortens itself, and when it consequently\r\ndistends the part of its body which is outside the old skin, that part\r\nacts against the edges of the slit, and gradually pushes the old skin\r\nupwards. Thus the caterpillar skin ascends, its plaits are pushed\r\nnearer and nearer together, and it is soon reduced to a packet so\r\nsmall that it covers only the end of the tail of the chrysalis (Fig.\r\n106).\r\n\r\nBut here comes the culminating point, the most difficult part of the\r\noperation. The chrysalis, which is shorter than the caterpillar, is at\r\nsome distance from the silky network to which it must fix itself; it\r\nis only supported by that extremity of the caterpillar's skin which\r\nhad not been split open. It has neither legs nor arms, and yet it must\r\nfree itself from this remaining part of the skin, and reach the\r\nthreads to which it is to suspend itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.--Chrysalis of the small Tortoise-shell\r\nButterfly completing the operation of casting its larval skin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.--Chrysalis divested of the larva skin.]\r\n\r\nThe supple and contractile segments of the chrysalis serve for the\r\nlimbs which are wanting to it. Between two of these segments, as with\r\na pair of pincers, the insect seizes a portion of the folded skin, and\r\nwith such a firm hold that it is able to support the whole of its body\r\non it. It now curves its hinder parts slightly, and draws its tail\r\nentirely out of the sheath in which it was enclosed. It then reposes\r\nfor an instant only, for it has not yet finished the laborious\r\noperation of its deliverance. It must free itself entirely from the\r\ndry skin which surrounds the extremity of its body.\r\n\r\nThe insect curves the part which is below its tail in such a manner\r\nthat that part can embrace and seize the packet to which it holds on.\r\nIt then gives to its body a violent shock, which makes it spin round\r\nmany times on its tail, and that with great rapidity. During all these\r\npirouettes the chrysalis acts against the skin; the hooks of its legs\r\nfray the threads, and break them or disentangle themselves from them.\r\nSometimes the threads do not break at once. Then the animal\r\nrecommences its revolutions in an opposite direction, and this time it\r\nis almost certain to succeed. Réaumur, however, saw a chrysalis which,\r\nafter having tired itself in vain in its endeavours to get entirely\r\nfree of its old skin, despairing of ever being able to manage it,\r\nabandoned it where it was so solidly fixed. We represent (Fig. 107),\r\nrather magnified, the chrysalis arrived at its final state, and\r\nsuspended to a branch of a tree by a network of silk.[38]\r\n\r\n    [38] It has been remarked that only those whose continuance in\r\n    the pupal state is short, undergo their metamorphosis in this\r\n    apparently inconvenient position.--ED.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the mode of suspension employed by those caterpillars,\r\nwhich, after having fixed themselves by the tail, strengthen the\r\nsupport by means of a small silk cord passed round their body.\r\n\r\nIt is again to Réaumur, that indefatigable observer of the habits of\r\ninsects, that we go for the details of this manner of suspension.\r\nAccording to Réaumur, these caterpillars make and put on this belt in\r\nthree different ways. But of these three ways the simplest, and the\r\nleast liable to meet with accident, is that employed by the larva of\r\nthe Cabbage Butterfly (_Pieris brassicæ_). When the time for its\r\nmetamorphosis is only a few days distant, one may observe this\r\ncaterpillar engaged in stretching threads on different parts of the\r\ncase in which it is confined. It then chooses a spot, which it covers\r\nentirely with threads, some more compact than the others, and disposed\r\nin layers, which cross each other in different directions. These\r\nthreads form a thin white cloth, against which the belly of the\r\ncaterpillar and later that of the chrysalis are applied. Very soon we\r\nsee a small hillock of silk rising. The caterpillar hooks itself on to\r\nthis by the claws of its hinder feet, and sets to work to secure\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nTo understand this process, it suffices to know that after having\r\nlengthened its body to a certain point, this caterpillar can turn back\r\nits head on to its back, and reach to the fifth ring, having its three\r\npairs of true legs in the air. But without putting the caterpillar\r\ninto such an unnatural position, let us take it in a position in which\r\nit is simply bent sideways in such a manner that its head, with the\r\nthread-spinning apparatus, which is below, can be applied opposite and\r\npretty near to one of the legs belonging to the first pair of\r\nmembranous legs. Our caterpillar begins by fixing on this point a\r\nthread, which is the first of those that are intended to tie it up\r\nsecurely.\r\n\r\n\"This thread,\" says the illustrious author of the \"Mémoires pour\r\nservir à l'Histoire des Insectes,\" \"must pass over the caterpillar's\r\nbody, and be attached by its other end near the leg corresponding to\r\nthat near which the first end was fastened. To spin the thread the\r\nproper length, and at the same time to fix it in its proper place, the\r\ncaterpillar has only to bring round its head to the fifth segment. The\r\nthread will be drawn from the spinning apparatus as the head advances\r\nover half the circumference of the circle which it has to describe;\r\nand when it has described this, there will only remain for it to\r\nsecure the second end of the thread against the support. Thus the\r\nhead, which was at first placed against one of the legs, advances\r\nlittle by little on the outline of the fifth ring as far as to its\r\nmiddle (Fig. 108). It is the facility the caterpillar has of reversing\r\nits body that enables it to make its head perform this journey, in\r\nproportion as it moves it over the circumference of the ring, it\r\ntwists its body. And at last, when it has brought it over the top of\r\nthe segment, its body is exactly folded in two; it draws it little by\r\nlittle from this situation by bending towards the other side, and by\r\ncausing its head to pass gently over the last quarter of the circle.\r\nAt last the caterpillar finds itself bound on the second side; the\r\nhead rests on the thread-covered plane, and the insect fixes the\r\nsecond end of the thread.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--Caterpillars of the Cabbage Butterfly\r\n(_Pieris brassicæ_).]\r\n\r\nIt has only to repeat the same manoeuvre as many times as there are\r\nthreads wanted to make a strong band. But each thread embraces the\r\nhead, or rather the lower part of the head, for it knows how to make\r\neach thread it spins glide into the bend or crease of its neck by a\r\nlittle movement of its head. It must disengage its head from under the\r\nband, not a difficult operation. It causes it to slide along the\r\nthreads near one of the places where they are fixed, and it is then in\r\nthe position indicated by the foregoing engraving (Fig. 109).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--Caterpillar of the Pieris brassicæ.]\r\n\r\nAbout thirty hours after the caterpillars have succeeded in making\r\nthemselves fast, they have completed their transformation into\r\nchrysalides (Fig. 110), where the chrysalis of the above-mentioned\r\ncaterpillar is seen in two different positions, and held by the same\r\nband which first supported the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--Pupæ of Pieris brassicæ.]\r\n\r\nThose caterpillars which construct cocoons make them of silk and other\r\nsubstances. These cocoons are, for the most part, oval or elliptical,\r\nsometimes boat-shaped, and ordinarily white, yellow, or brown in\r\ncolour. The threads may very slightly adhere together, or be closely\r\nunited by a gummy substance with which the caterpillar lines the\r\ninterior of the cocoon, and which it expels from the anus. Some\r\ncocoons are composed of a double envelope, others are of a uniform\r\ntexture. Some are of a tissue so close that they entirely hide the\r\nchrysalis contained within; others form a very light covering, through\r\nwhich the chrysalis can be easily perceived (Fig. 111).\r\n\r\nAmong caterpillars that make a very slight cocoon, some, as the\r\n_Catocalas_, gather together two or three leaves into a ball, to\r\nprotect them. Others strengthen their cocoons, and render them opaque\r\nby adding earth or other substances, often obtained from their own\r\nbodies. Some, after having spun their cocoon, cast forth through the\r\nanus three or four masses of a matter resembling paste, which they\r\napply with their head to the inside of the cocoon, and which, drying\r\nquickly, becomes pulverulent. Others employ for the same purpose the\r\nhairs with which their bodies are covered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Cocoon, after Réaumur.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--Larvæ of Catocala fraxini.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--Larva of Acronycta aceris.]\r\n\r\nThe larva of _Acronycta aceris_ (Fig. 113) is covered with tufts of\r\nyellow hair. Réaumur made these caterpillars work under his own eye in\r\nglass vases. They make the layer which is to form the exterior surface\r\nof their shell, or cocoon, of pure silk, and when it is thick enough,\r\ntear out their hair, now from one place, now from another. But we will\r\nleave the illustrious observer to relate this operation himself, which\r\nmust without doubt be painful to the poor animal:--\r\n\r\n\"Its two jaws are the pincers the caterpillar uses in seizing a\r\nportion of one or other of the tufts of hair; and when it has seized\r\nit, it tears it out without much difficulty. It at once places this\r\nagainst the tissue it has already commenced, in which it entangles it\r\nat first simply by pressure; it fixes it then more securely by\r\nspinning over it. It does not leave off tearing out its hairs till it\r\nhas entirely stripped them off. When the caterpillar has taken between\r\nits jaws and torn out a whole tuft of hair, the head carries it and\r\ndeposits it on some part of the lower surface of the cocoon; but it\r\ndoes not leave the hairs of such a large parcel together. The next\r\nmoment one sees its head moving about very quickly; then taking a\r\nportion of the hairs from the little heap, it distributes them about\r\non the neighbouring parts of the cocoon. If one opens one of these\r\nshells before the caterpillar has become a chrysalis, the larva, which\r\nis quite naked, and which was only known by its hair, can be no longer\r\nrecognised.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--Larva of Acronycta aceris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--Larva of Acronycta aceris taken out of its\r\ncocoon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.--Larva of Chelonia caja.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the Tiger Moth, or Woolly Bear, called by Réaumur\r\n_Marte_ or _Herisson_ (_Chelonia caja_, Fig. 116), is covered with\r\nlong inclined hairs. This caterpillar also makes use of its hairs for\r\nstrengthening the tissue of its cocoon; but whether it feels the pain\r\nmore acutely than the former, or whether it would suffer more, it does\r\nnot tear out its hairs. It adopts another system; it cuts them. The\r\ncaterpillar is then enveloped on all sides in its hair, which is to\r\nserve in the construction of its cocoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.--Larva of Chelonia caja forming its cocoon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.--Small Caterpillar of the Pimpernel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.--Cocoon of the same.]\r\n\r\nAnother species uses its hairs in the composition of its cocoon; but\r\nit adopts an entirely peculiar way of tearing them out, when the\r\ntissue of its cocoon has become a species of network of pretty closely\r\npacked rings. Réaumur one day saw one part of the cocoon bristling\r\nwith hairs. These were the hairs of a part of the back of the\r\ncaterpillar, which it had pushed through the rings of its cocoon. The\r\ncaterpillar then moved about as if rubbing this part of its back\r\nsuccessively in opposite directions against the interior surface of\r\nthe cocoon. In this way the hairs were very soon torn out and kept\r\nretained in the rings of the cocoon. This cocoon is then bristly\r\ninside, and does not at all suit the future chrysalis, which does not\r\nlike to be touched by any but smooth surfaces. The caterpillar then\r\nworks with its head, to lay the hairs along the interior surface, and\r\nto keep them down by threads, which it draws over them. At another\r\ntime Réaumur saw a small hairy caterpillar, which appeared to live on\r\nlichens, using its hair in another way. It tore them out to make its\r\ncocoon, but it was not to lay them down and work them into a tissue.\r\nIt set them straight up like the stakes of palisades, on the\r\ncircumference of an oval space, in which it was placed. Shut up within\r\nthis palisade, it spun a light white web. This web supports the hairs,\r\ncausing the greater part of them to curve at their upper extremity,\r\nin such a manner as to form a sort of cradle.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us now to speak of the caterpillars that make their\r\ncocoons of silk, together with other materials. Réaumur saw the\r\nPimpernel caterpillar arranging and sticking together the leaves of\r\nthat plant, and spinning underneath them a thin cocoon of white silk\r\n(Fig. 119).\r\n\r\nSome caterpillars make their cocoons on the surface of the earth, and\r\neven with earth. These cocoons are spherical or oblong. Their exterior\r\nis more or less well shaped, but their interior is always smooth,\r\npolished, shining like moistened earth, worked up together into a kind\r\nof paste, and carefully smoothed out. This cocoon is besides lined\r\nwith a covering of silk of variable thickness. The shell is not made\r\nof earth alone; threads of silk may be seen in it, crossing each\r\nother, and binding together the particles of earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.--Larva of Cucullia verbasci.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.--Cocoon of the Cucullia verbasci.]\r\n\r\nThese subterranean workers do not allow their proceedings to be easily\r\nobserved. Réaumur was fortunate enough to be able to notice their\r\nskill in the construction of their shells or cocoons. The _Cucullia\r\nverbasci_ (Fig. 120) makes itself a thick and very compact cocoon of\r\nthe form of an egg (Fig. 121). Réaumur took one of these out of the\r\nground before it is fortified. He tore it partially open, and placed\r\nit in a glass vase containing sand, but the poor insect was not long\r\nin repairing the disorder caused by the rough hand of our naturalist.\r\nIt only took four hours to restore its cocoon to its former state.\r\n\r\n\"It began,\" says Réaumur, \"by coming almost entirely out, and left\r\nonly its hinder part within. It moved its head forwards as far as was\r\nnecessary to enable it to seize a particle of earth. As soon as it had\r\ngot its load, it re-entered the interior of the cocoon. It deposited\r\nthe grain of earth, and came out again immediately, as it did at\r\nfirst, to pick up another grain, which it carried likewise into the\r\ninterior of the cocoon. This operation it continued for more than an\r\nhour.... The provision of materials being got together, the\r\ncaterpillar now devoted his whole attention to working them up. It\r\nbegan by spinning over one part of the edges of the opening. After\r\nhaving put over this a small band of very loose web, the caterpillar's\r\nhead left the opening, the insect went right back again into its\r\ncocoon, and the head returned to the opening loaded with a little\r\ngrain of earth, which it entangled in the silky threads. It then\r\nentangled in them two or three, or a greater number of grains,\r\naccording to the quantity of threads it had spun. It bound them into\r\nthese with other threads, after which it drew threads over the edges\r\nof another part. By thus going round the whole rim of the opening, and\r\nby carrying and fixing the grains of earth in the threads which were\r\nthe last stretched over the opening, it rendered its diameter smaller\r\nand smaller.\"\r\n\r\nIt was by working with its head that our mason gave to the new wall of\r\nits cocoon the necessary curvature. It was interesting to know how, as\r\nit could no longer put out its head, it could stop up the orifice.\r\n\r\n\"It knew how to change its manoeuvres. When the opening was reduced\r\nto a circle of only a few lines in diameter, it drew threads from a\r\npoint on the circumference to another on the other side.... Thus the\r\nopening was covered in with a rather open network.... As soon as this\r\nweb was finished, it got a grain of earth (which it had laid by until\r\nit was wanted), brought it up, placed it against the web, and by\r\npushing and pressing it, made it pass through the web until it reached\r\nthe exterior, and so in succession the whole of the web was covered\r\nwith grains of earth.... It was not satisfied with rendering the\r\nexterior of this place exactly like the rest of the shell; it\r\nfortified it thoroughly; it added to it, one after another, layers of\r\ngrains of earth, till it was as solid and as thick as the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe larva of _Pyralis corticalis_, which is found on oak trees in the\r\nmonth of May, shows to what a point these little insects carry their\r\nindustry in the construction of their cocoons, in the choice of their\r\nmaterials, in their manner of working them up, and in the forms they\r\ncause them to assume. Réaumur one day saw this caterpillar on a small\r\nbranch, between two triangular appendages (Figs. 122, 123). This was\r\nthe beginning of a cocoon. Each triangular blade was composed of a\r\ngreat number of small, thin, rectangular plates, taken from the bark\r\nof the twig. The caterpillar detached with its jaws a small band of\r\nbark, and fitted it on, and adjusted it with admirable precision\r\nagainst the edge already formed. It then fixed it securely with silk\r\nthreads. Réaumur saw this caterpillar work and erect in this way a\r\nlarge blade during an hour and a half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 122, 123.--Cocoon of Pyralis corticalis\r\n(magnified, proper size 2/3 inch).]\r\n\r\n\"When one sees,\" he says,[39] \"an insect which, to construct a cocoon,\r\nbegins by collecting together an infinite number of small plates of\r\nbark in order to compose of them two flat triangular blades; which, to\r\ngain its end, takes means that seem so roundabout, although they are\r\nthe most suitable and the quickest it could adopt, one is very much\r\ntempted to consider such an insect, when one sees it thus acting,\r\npossessed of reason.\"\r\n\r\n    [39] Mem. 12, vol. i., p. 487.\r\n\r\nThese two blades are at last transformed into a regular cocoon. The\r\nlittle animal, which is at the same time architect, cabinet-maker, and\r\nweaver, arranges it in such a way as to form a hollow cone, which it\r\nonly remains for it to shut. Réaumur calls this sort of cocoon or\r\nshell, _la coque en bateau_, the boat-shaped cocoon. Some caterpillars\r\nweave cocoons of the same form with pure silk.\r\n\r\nTo bring this subject to an end, we will mention the industry of the\r\nPuss Moth (_Dicranura vinula_), and that of a small _Tinea_, which\r\neats the barley stored away in our granaries.\r\n\r\nThe larva of the puss moth employs in the construction of its shell\r\nthe wood of the tree on which it has lived. It bites it up, and mixing\r\nit with a glutinous fluid which it secretes from its mouth, reduces it\r\nto a sort of paste, which it then uses in the formation of an\r\nenvelope, of such hardness that a knife can hardly cut into it.\r\n\r\nThe _Tinea_ lines the interior of a grain, of which it has previously\r\ndevoured the contents, with a coating of silk, and divides it thus\r\ninto two different chambers. In one of these it is to change into a\r\npupa; in the other it places its excrement. And so the little careful\r\narchitect constructs its house in such a manner as to find in it\r\ntranquillity, cleanliness, and comfort.\r\n\r\nWhen caterpillars have not within their reach the materials they are\r\nin the habit of employing, like good workmen, they content themselves\r\nwith what they can get. Réaumur reared a caterpillar which formed its\r\ncocoon of pieces of the paper of which the box was made in which it\r\nwas imprisoned.\r\n\r\nWhat an extraordinary condition! what a strange phase of vitality does\r\nthe chrysalis present to us--a being occupying the middle state\r\nbetween the caterpillar and the perfect insect! How little does it\r\nresemble that which it previously was, and what it will become! In\r\nappearance it is scarcely a living being; it takes no nourishment, and\r\nhas no digestive organs; can neither walk nor drag itself along, and\r\nhardly bends the joints of its body. The outside skin of the\r\nchrysalis appears to be cartilaginous; it is generally smooth,\r\nalthough some species have hairs scattered over their bodies.\r\n\r\nWe distinguish in chrysalides two opposite sides. The one is the\r\ninsect's back, the other its under side. On the upper part of the\r\nlatter (Fig. 124) we perceive various raised portions, formed and\r\narranged like the bands round the heads of mummies; the back is plain\r\nand rounded in a great number of pupæ; but a great many others have on\r\nthe upper part, along the edges which separate the two sides, little\r\nhumps, eminences broader than they are thick, ending in a sharp point\r\n(Fig. 125).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.--A conical pupa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.--Pupa having angular projections.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.--Angular pupa of a Butterfly.]\r\n\r\nThe head of the angular pupæ terminates sometimes in two angular\r\nparts, which diverge from each other like two horns (Fig. 126). In\r\nsome other cases they are curved into the form of a crescent. These\r\nappendages sometimes give to the pupa the appearance of a mask,\r\nespecially as an eminence placed on the middle of the back is rather\r\nlike a nose, and the small cavities may represent the eyes (Fig. 125).\r\n\r\nThe colours of angular pupæ attract our attention. Some are superbly\r\ntinted; they appear to be wrapped in silk and gold. Others have only\r\nspots of gold and silver on their belly or their back. All, however,\r\nhave not this remarkable splendour, not these metallic spots. Some are\r\ngreen, yellow, and spotted with gold. Generally they are brown.\r\nRéaumur has shown that this golden colour is not due, as was thought\r\nfor a long while, to colouring matter, but to a little whitish\r\nmembrane, placed under the skin, which reflects the light through the\r\nthin outer pellicle, in such a manner as to produce the optical\r\nillusion which imparts to the robe of the chrysalis the golden hues of\r\na princess in grand costume. _All is not gold that glitters_, Réaumur\r\nproves literally, in the case of chrysalis.[40]\r\n\r\n    [40] The word is derived from [Greek: chrysos], golden; for\r\n    that reason pupa is a better word than chrysalis, as this only\r\n    strictly applies to a very small number; for the same reason\r\n    aurelia is a bad word.--ED.\r\n\r\nLet us add that the chrysalis remains thus superbly dressed as long as\r\nit is tenanted, but loses its colour as soon as the butterfly has\r\nquitted it.\r\n\r\nThe cone-shaped pupæ belong to the twilight and night-flying\r\nLepidoptera, and to those butterflies whose caterpillars are\r\nonisciform, or in shape resembling a wood-louse. They are generally\r\noval, rounded at the head, and more or less conical at the lower end.\r\nTheir colour is generally of a uniform chestnut brown.\r\n\r\nWhat a mystery is that which is accomplished in the transition from\r\nthe chrysalis to the perfect state! Those great changes from the larva\r\nstate to that of the pupa, and from the pupa to that of the imago, are\r\naccomplished with such rapidity, that the phenomena were looked on as\r\nsudden metamorphoses, like those related in mythology. It has been\r\nthought also that there was in these changes from one state to another\r\na sort of resurrection. There is here neither sudden metamorphosis,\r\nnor, as we will show, resurrection. In fact, the chrysalis is a living\r\nbeing; it indeed shows its vitality by exterior movements. Under the\r\nold skin of a caterpillar about to moult, under the envelope which is\r\nsoon to be cast off, the new integuments are being prepared.\r\n\r\nSome days before the moult, split the caterpillar's skin, and you will\r\nfind the skin which is to take its place already beneath. If, some\r\ndays before the transformation of the caterpillar into a chrysalis, it\r\nis dissected, the rudiments of wings and antennæ may be discovered. If\r\na chrysalis is examined on the outside, all the parts of the future\r\ninsect can be distinguished under the skin: the wings, the legs, the\r\nantennæ, the proboscis, &c.; only, these parts are folded and packed\r\naway in such a manner that the chrysalis can make no use of them. It\r\ncould not, moreover, make use of them on account of their incomplete\r\ndevelopment. Fig. 127 shows, after Réaumur,[41] a chrysalis magnified\r\nand seen from its lower side, on which we observe:--_a_, the wings; _b\r\nb_, the antennæ; _t_, the trunk or proboscis.\r\n\r\n    [41] Tome i., p. 382, planche 26, Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nThere is a moment when these parts, pressed one against each other,\r\nand as it were swathed up like a mummy, are very easily seen, for they\r\nare, as we may say, laid bare. This moment is that in which the pupa\r\nhas just quitted the caterpillar's skin. It is then still soft and\r\ntender. Its body is moistened with a liquid, which, drying rapidly,\r\nbecomes opaque, coloured, and of a membranous consistency. The result\r\nis that the parts which did not cohere in the least when the chrysalis\r\nmade its first appearance, are fastened together, so that although\r\nthey could at first be seen, through a layer of transparent fluid,\r\nthey are now hidden under a sort of veil or cloak. It is necessary to\r\nseize then the moment of the birth of the chrysalis, to observe it\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\nOn examining the pupa before the liquid which pervades these parts has\r\nhad time to dry, it resembles the perfect insect. All the exterior\r\nparts which belong to the imago can be distinguished. One recognises\r\nthe head, which is then resting on the thorax; the two eyes and the\r\nantennæ (Fig. 128), which are brought forward like two ribbons; the\r\nwings also brought over the thorax, but these are separated\r\nartificially in the drawing we have given after Réaumur;[42] and\r\nlastly in the space left between the wings, the six legs, and the body\r\nof the insect.\r\n\r\n    [42] Tome i., p. 382, planche 26, Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.--Chrysalis of the large Tortoise-shell\r\nButterfly (_Vanessa polychloros_), magnified, seen from the lower side.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the pupa, when it approaches the period for being hatched\r\nis only a swaddled butterfly. Directly it has strength enough to rid\r\nitself of its wrapping, the insect frees itself from its fetters; it\r\nflies away, brilliant and free, and its many-coloured wings glitter in\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the pupa state is variable, according to the species\r\nand the temperature. Réaumur placed in a hot-house, in the month of\r\nJanuary, some pupæ which, in the ordinary course of things, would not\r\nhave been hatched till the month of May, and a fortnight afterwards\r\nthe imagos had appeared. On the other hand, he shut up some pupæ in an\r\nice-house during the whole of a summer, and thus retarded their being\r\nhatched by a whole year. The influence of the temperature on the\r\nperiod of emerging, and, consequently, the influence of the seasons on\r\nthe length of this period, are completely brought to light by these\r\nexperiments.[43]\r\n\r\n    [43] They hardly seem from later experiments to be so fully\r\n    explained. It is a well-known fact that many insects remain in\r\n    this state a variable time--the Small Eggar (_Bombyx\r\n    lanestris_) sometimes as many as seven years.--ED.\r\n\r\nWe will now see how the insect delivers itself from the last skin. To\r\nquit the pupa case is not so laborious an operation as it was for the\r\nsame insect to quit the caterpillar's skin. This is because the pupa\r\ncase is drier; it does not adhere to every part of the body, and is\r\nbrittle. Those insects which are enclosed in a cocoon free themselves\r\nof the pupa envelope in the cocoon itself. To witness the last\r\noperation, the cocoon may be opened, and the pupa drawn out of it with\r\ncare. If it is then placed in a box, the metamorphosis may be\r\nobserved. To study this last evolution more at his ease, Réaumur\r\ncovered a large extent of the wall of his study with pupæ of the\r\n_Vanessa polychloros_ and other species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.--Chrysalis of the Large Tortoise-shell\r\nButterfly (_Vanessa polychloros_) whose different parts have been\r\nopened before they were fastened down. (_a_, wings; _b b_, antennæ;\r\n_t_, trunk, or proboscis.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the parts of the body of the insect have attained a certain\r\ndegree of solidity within the envelope, it has no great difficulty in\r\nmaking the thin and friable membrane which surrounds it split in\r\ndifferent places. If it even distends itself or moves, a small opening\r\nwill be made in the dried skin. If the movements persist, the opening\r\nincreases in size, and very soon allows the imago to emerge.\r\n\r\nIt is on the middle of the upper part of the thorax that the envelope\r\nbegins to split. The split extends over the middle of the forehead and\r\nback. The pieces of the thorax open, separate themselves from the\r\nother parts to which they were fixed, and the insect can take\r\nadvantage of the opening which is made, and escape. Little by little\r\nalso it advances its head. The head is the first out of the old skin,\r\nand the insect sets itself entirely free.\r\n\r\nThis occupies rather a long time; for we must remember that, under the\r\npupal envelope, its legs, its antennæ, its wings, and many other\r\nparts, are enclosed in special cases. These peculiar circumstances\r\nshow that the animal has much trouble and must employ some time in\r\nsetting free all the parts.\r\n\r\nAt last our prisoner has come out of its narrow cell, and is delivered\r\nfrom its old covering. What poet can describe to us the sensations of\r\nthis charming and frail creature which has just risen from the tomb,\r\nand for the first time is enjoying the splendid light of day, the\r\nradiant sky, and the flowers redolent with delicious perfumes, which\r\nare inviting it to kiss and caress them!\r\n\r\nThe wings strike one most. They are very small at the time of birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.--Moth just emerged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.--Moth whose wings are folded up.]\r\n\r\nFig. 129 represents, after Réaumur,[44] a moth at the moment in which\r\nit has just emerged from the pupa. But at the end of a short period\r\nthe wings become developed; only they are wrinkled, as Fig. 130, given\r\nby Réaumur, represents.\r\n\r\n    [44] Tome i., p. 654, planche 46, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nRéaumur having taken between his fingers a very short wing of a\r\nbutterfly which was just hatched, drew it about gently in all\r\ndirections. He succeeded thus in giving it the whole extent it would\r\nhave assumed naturally. According to Réaumur the wing of a butterfly\r\njust born, which appears so small, is really already provided with all\r\nits parts, only it is folded and re-folded on itself. He supposes that\r\nwhat his hands did to lengthen the butterfly's wings, is done\r\nnaturally by the liquids which are contained in the insect which has\r\njust emerged, and whose wings are no longer confined in their cases.\r\nAt the time of its birth the wings are flat and thick; as they grow,\r\nlittle by little they spread themselves out and become curled up. When\r\nthey are completely developed and flattened the wings become firm and\r\nhard imperceptibly, and this firmness extends at the same time to the\r\nwhole of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.--Moth whose wings are developing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.--Moth whose wings are developed.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 131 and 132, borrowed, like the preceding, from the 14th Memoir\r\nof Réaumur (_sur la transformation des chrysalides en papillons_),\r\nshow the states through which the wings of the same moth pass, before\r\nthey are thoroughly developed.\r\n\r\nThose pupæ enclosed in cocoons free themselves entirely or in part\r\nfrom their old skin, in the shell itself; but the imago is still a\r\nprisoner. It has broken through a first enclosure; it must open itself\r\na way through the second. How does it manage to bore through the often\r\nvery solid walls of this second prison, so as to regain its liberty?\r\nRéaumur states that in the Lackey Moth (_Bombyx neustria_) the head is\r\nthe only instrument of which the insect makes use in opening a\r\npassage, the compound eyes then acting like files. These files cut the\r\nvery fine threads of which the cocoon is composed, and as soon as the\r\nend of the cocoon is pierced through, the insect uses its thorax like\r\na wedge, to enlarge the hole. It very soon manages to get its two\r\nfront legs out, fixes itself by them on to the outside, and little by\r\nlittle emerges from its prison.\r\n\r\nTHE PERFECT INSECT.\r\n\r\nWho does not admire the extraordinary splendour, the vivacity, the\r\nprodigious variety of colours of these brilliant inhabitants of the\r\nair? Some amateurs have devoted to the purchase of certain butterflies\r\nlarge sums of money. \"Diamonds,\" says Réaumur on the subject, \"have\r\nperhaps beauties no more real than those of a butterfly's wings; but\r\nthey have a beauty which is more acknowledged by the world in general,\r\nand which is more recognised in commerce.\" The essential character of\r\nbutterflies and moths makes them very easily recognisable among all\r\nother insects. All have four wings, which are covered with scales,\r\nthat communicate to them the brilliant colours with which they are\r\ndecorated. It is these scales which adhere to the fingers when we\r\nseize one of these charming creatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.--Different forms of the scales of Butterflies,\r\nafter Réaumur.]\r\n\r\nFor a long time this dust was thought to be formed of very small\r\nfeathers, but Réaumur showed that it is composed of little scales.\r\nTheir form varies singularly, as we may see in Fig. 133, borrowed from\r\nthe Memoirs of Réaumur,[45] which represents the different forms of\r\nthe scales which cover the wings of Lepidoptera. M. Bernard Deschamps\r\nhas closely studied them. According to this naturalist, they are\r\ncomposed of three membranes, or plates, superposed one on the other,\r\nof which the first is covered with granulations of a rounded form,\r\nwhich give to these scales their splendid and varied colours; the\r\nsecond plate is covered with silk, forming sometimes curious designs;\r\nthe third plate, viz., that which is applied to the membrane of the\r\nwing, has the peculiar property of reflecting colours the most\r\nbrilliant and the most varied, although the surface of the scales\r\nvisible to the eye is often dull and colourless.\r\n\r\n    [45] Tome i., planche 7, Figs. 1 à 23.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing,\" says M. Bernard Deschamps, \"that a painter was\r\npossessed of colours rich enough to represent on canvas with all\r\ntheir splendour, gold, silver, the opal, the ruby, the sapphire, the\r\nemerald, and the other precious stones which the East produces, that\r\nwith these colours he formed all the shades which could result from\r\ntheir combination, one might affirm without the chance of contradiction,\r\nthat he would have none of these colours and of their various shades,\r\nwhatever might be the number, which could not be discovered by the\r\nmicroscope on part of the scales of the Lepidoptera, which Nature has\r\nbeen pleased to conceal from our gaze.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.--Portion of the wing of a Moth (_Saturnia\r\npavonia major_), magnified.]\r\n\r\nEach of these scales adheres to the membrane of the wing by a small\r\ntube, which is solidly fixed to it. Réaumur has called our attention\r\nto the admirable arrangement of these scales, which are disposed like\r\nthose of fish, that is to say, in such a manner that those of a row\r\nshall partially overlap those in the following one.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 134, representing a portion of the wing of the _Saturnia\r\npavonia major_, magnified, which we borrow from Réaumur's Memoir, the\r\nscales are arranged in rows; isolated scales, and the points where\r\nother scales were fixed before they were taken off, are represented.\r\n\r\nThe membranous frame which supports the coloured scales of butterflies\r\nand moths is well worth a moment's consideration. It consists of two\r\nmembranes intimately united by their interior surfaces, and divided\r\ninto many distinct parts by horny, fistulous threads, more or less\r\nramified, which seem intended to support the two membranes mentioned\r\nabove, and which branch out from the base to the edge of the wing.\r\nTheir number, counting from the exterior edge, is not always the same\r\nin the upper and lower wings. It varies from eight to twelve.\r\n\r\nWith its large and light wings, the butterfly can fly for a long time.\r\nBut this flight is not in the least regular; it is not made in a\r\nstraight line. When the insect has to go some distance, it flies\r\nalternately up and down. The line it takes is composed of an infinity\r\nof zig-zags, going up and down, and from right to left. This\r\nirregularity of flight saves the little insect from falling a prey to\r\nbirds. \"I saw one day with pleasure,\" says Réaumur, \"a sparrow which\r\npursued in the air a butterfly for nearly ten minutes without being\r\nable to catch it. The flight of the bird was nevertheless considerably\r\nmore rapid than that of the butterfly, but the butterfly was always\r\nhigher or lower than the place to which the bird flew, and where it\r\nthought it would catch it.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the wings to pass on to the other parts of the\r\nbutterfly. These other parts are the _thorax_ or chest, the body or\r\n_abdomen_, and the _head_.\r\n\r\nThe thorax is solidly put together, so as to bear the movements of the\r\nwings and legs. These latter are composed, as in other insects, of\r\nfive parts: the coxa, the trochanter, the thigh, the shank, and the\r\ntarsus.\r\n\r\nMany butterflies have all their six legs of equal length. In others,\r\nthe two fore legs are very small, and are not suited for walking. In\r\nothers, again, they are rudimentary, being deprived of hooks, very\r\nhairy, and applied on to the front of the breast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.--Leg of Butterfly armed with hooks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.--Leg not suitable for walking.]\r\n\r\nThis difference of structure may be seen in Figs. 135 and 136, one of\r\nwhich represents, after Réaumur, a leg unsuited for walking, very\r\nhairy, and terminated in a sort of brush resembling the tail on a\r\ntippet; and the other a leg furnished with hooks.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen has the form of an elongated, or--in the majority of\r\nspecies--an almost cylindrical oval. It is composed of five segments,\r\neach formed of an upper and a lower ring, joined together by a\r\nmembrane. The first are larger than the others, and generally overlap\r\nthe edges, which gives to this part of the body the power of dilating\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nWe must dwell longer on the head. It is generally rounded, compressed\r\nin front, longer than it is broad, and furnished with fine or scaly\r\nhairs. The important organs of which this part is the seat are the\r\neyes, the antennæ, the palpi, and the proboscis or trunk.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are more or less spherical, surrounded by hairs, and composed\r\nof innumerable facettes. Colours are seen on these as various as those\r\nof the rainbow. But the colour which serves as a base to all, is black\r\nin some, grey in others; then again there are different gold or bronze\r\ncolours of the greatest splendour, inclining sometimes to red,\r\nsometimes to yellow, sometimes to green. On the compound eye of a\r\nbutterfly as many as 17,325 facettes have been counted. Simple eyes,\r\nor stemmata, are moreover observed in certain species, and are\r\ngenerally more or less hidden by scales.\r\n\r\nThe antennæ are situated near the upper rim or border of each eye.\r\nRéaumur has pointed out six principal shapes. One terminates in a\r\nlittle _knob_, and belongs to the butterflies. The others are\r\nvariously shaped, and belong to the moths. Some are prismatic, or like\r\nbeading. And lastly, others are shaped like feathers. We represent, in\r\nFig. 137, the different forms of the antennæ, which Réaumur collected\r\ntogether in plates 8 and 9 of his fifth Memoir.[46]\r\n\r\n    [46] \"Sur les parties extérieures des papillons,\" tome i., p. 197.\r\n\r\nThe palpi are four in number, two maxillary and two labial. The first\r\nare generally excessively small; one can only ascertain their\r\nexistence by the aid of a strong magnifying glass: the second are in\r\ngeneral very apparent, straight, cylindrical, covered with scales, and\r\nformed of three joints, of which the last is often very small and\r\nsometimes very pointed. They also sometimes bristle with stiff or\r\nsilky hairs.\r\n\r\nThe trunk is placed exactly between the two eyes. As long as the\r\nbutterfly does not want to take nourishment, the trunk remains rolled\r\nin a spiral. Some are so short, that they scarcely make one turn and a\r\nhalf or two turns; some larger sized make three turns and a half or\r\nfour turns; lastly, some very long are curled as many as eight or ten\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThis is how the butterfly makes use of its trunk: When fluttering\r\naround a flower, it will very soon settle on or quite close to it.\r\nThe trunk is then brought forward entirely or almost entirely\r\nunrolled; very soon afterwards it is almost straightened, then\r\ndirected downwards, and plunged into the flower. Sometimes the insect\r\ndraws it out a moment after, curves it, twists it a little, and\r\nsometimes even curls it partially up. Immediately it straightens it\r\nagain, to plunge it a second time into the same flower. It repeats the\r\nsame manoeuvre seven or eight times, and then flies on to another\r\nflower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.--Antennæ of Lepidoptera.]\r\n\r\nThis trunk, of which the butterfly makes such good use, is composed\r\nof two filaments more or less long, horny, concave in their interior\r\nsurfaces, and fastened together by their edges. When cut transversely,\r\none sees, according to Réaumur,[47] that the interior is composed of\r\nthree small rings. Consequently, there are three canals in the trunk:\r\none central, the other two lateral (Fig. 138). Are all these three\r\nused to conduct the juice of flowers into the butterfly's body?\r\nRéaumur has made some very interesting observations on this subject,\r\nby observing a moth which was sucking a lump of sugar whilst its\r\nportrait was being taken.\r\n\r\n    [47] Planche 9, Fig. 10, 5e Mémoire, \"Sur les parties\r\n    extérieures des papillons.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.--Section of a Butterfly's Trunk, after Réaumur.]\r\n\r\n\"I held in one hand,\" says Réaumur, \"a powerful magnifying glass,\r\nwhich I brought near to that part of the trunk I wished to examine; I\r\nwas sometimes half a minute, or nearly a minute, without perceiving\r\nanything, after which I saw clearly a little column of liquid mounting\r\nquickly along the whole length of the trunk. Often this column\r\nappeared to be intersected by little balls, which seemed to be\r\nglobules of air which had been drawn up with the liquid.\r\n\r\n\"This liquid ascended thus during three or four seconds, and then\r\nceased. At the end of an interval of a greater number of seconds, or\r\nsometimes after an interval as short, I saw some fresh liquid mounting\r\nup along the trunk. But it was straight up the middle of the trunk\r\nthat it seemed to ascend.\r\n\r\n\"The Author of Nature has given to insects means of working, which,\r\nthough very simple, we cannot divine, and which often we are not able\r\neven to perceive. Whilst I was observing the trunk of our butterfly,\r\nbetween the columns of liquid which I saw ascending, there were, but\r\nmore rarely, times when I saw, on the contrary, liquid descending from\r\nthe base of the trunk to the point. The descending liquid occupied\r\nhalf or two-thirds of the tube. It was no longer difficult to perceive\r\nhow the butterfly is able to nourish itself on honey, the thickest\r\nsyrup, and even the most solid sugar. The fluid it sends down is\r\nprobably very liquid; it drives against the sugar, moistens, and\r\ndissolves it. The butterfly pumps this liquid up again when it is\r\ncharged with sugar, and conducts it along as far as the base of its\r\ntrunk, and beyond it.\"\r\n\r\nThe life of the perfect insect is generally very short. Like nearly\r\nall other insects, they die as soon as they have propagated their\r\nspecies. The female lays her eggs, which vary in shape, on the plant\r\nwhich is to nourish her progeny. The colour is also very various, and\r\npasses through all sorts of shades. At the moment they are laid, many\r\nare covered with a gummy substance, insoluble in water, which serves\r\nto stick them on the plant.\r\n\r\nIn some species the mother lays her eggs on the trunks of trees, and\r\ncovers them with down or with the hairs which clothe her abdomen, so\r\nas to preserve them from cold and damp. She may also hide them\r\nentirely under a whitish foamy substance. Some do not lay more than a\r\nhundred eggs; others lay some thousands.\r\n\r\nTo bring the history of the Lepidoptera to an end, it only remains for\r\nus to give a sketch of their classification, and to point out some\r\nspecies remarkable, either on account of their beauty or their\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nWe see during the day butterflies flying in our gardens, in meadows\r\nfull of flowers, or in the alleys of woods. Towards evening, at the\r\nsombre hour of twilight, the stroller is sometimes surprised to see\r\npass near him large moths, with a heavy and unequal flight; or, if we\r\ngo into a garden on a beautiful calm summer's night, bearing a light,\r\nwe see a crowd of moths flying from all parts towards it.\r\n\r\nIt is on account of these different hours at which the Lepidoptera\r\nshow themselves, that naturalists for a long time divided them into\r\ndiurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal. This division was simple,\r\nconvenient, and seemed founded on Nature. Unfortunately, the _night_\r\nfliers of the old authors do not all fly by night: some species,\r\nclassed by the old naturalists among the crepuscular, or nocturnal,\r\nshow themselves in the very middle of the day, seeking their food in\r\nthe hottest rays of the sun. In the regions near the poles they appear\r\nduring the day, and in other countries they are more or less friends\r\nof the twilight.\r\n\r\nSo as not to multiply methodical divisions, we will confine ourselves\r\nto classing the Lepidoptera into two sections.\r\n\r\nThe first section contains those _which fly during the day, which have\r\nclub-shaped antennæ, and which have their four wings entirely free,\r\nand standing perpendicularly[48] when the insect is at rest_. They are\r\ncalled Butterflies, or Rhopalocera. This section is divided into a\r\nnumber of families, which comprise many genera. We will content\r\nourselves with calling the attention of the reader to some of the most\r\nremarkable of these groups, and to those species which, either on\r\naccount of their beauty or abundance, strike, or ought to strike, the\r\nattention of every one.\r\n\r\n    [48] There are exceptions to this.--ED.\r\n\r\nIn the family of the _Papilionidi_, we will mention the genera\r\n_Papilio_, to which belong the Swallow-tailed Butterfly (_Papilio\r\nmachaon_), _Papilio podalirius_, &c., and _Parnassius_, of which we\r\nwill notice _Parnassius Apollo_, and _Parnassius Mnemosyne_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.--Swallow-tailed Butterfly (_Papilio machaon_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.--Larva and Chrysalis of Papilio machaon.]\r\n\r\nThe swallow-tailed butterfly is found plentifully in the fens of\r\nCambridgeshire, and Norfolk and Suffolk, and very commonly in the\r\nenvirons of Paris. It is seen from the beginning of May till towards\r\nthe middle of June; then from the end of July till September. It\r\nfrequents gardens, woods, and, above all, fields of lucerne. It is\r\neasily taken when settled, particularly at sunset.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest and the most beautiful of the European\r\nbutterflies. The wings are variegated with yellow and black; the eyes,\r\nantennæ, and trunk are black. The body is yellow on the sides and\r\nunderneath, and black above. The front wings have rounded edges; the\r\nhind ones, on the contrary, are notched, and one of these notches is\r\nprolonged into a sort of tail. The first are black, spotted and\r\nstriped with yellow; the second have their upper part and middle\r\nyellow, with some touches only of black. Near the margin is a broad\r\nblack band, dusted with blue; lastly, six yellow spots in the form of\r\na crescent run along the border, and end in a magnificent eye of a\r\nreddish colour, bordered with blue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.--Papilio Alexanor.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this species is large, smooth, and of a beautiful\r\nlight green, with a transverse black band on each ring. These bands\r\nare sprinkled with orange spots. It lives on the fennel, carrot, and\r\nother Umbelliferæ. If teased, it thrusts from the first ring after\r\nthe head a fleshy, orange-coloured tentacle. The chrysalis, attached\r\nto a stalk of grass, is sometimes light green, sometimes greyish.\r\n\r\nIn the low Alps, on the plains near the environs of Digne and\r\nBarcelonette, is found in the months of May and July the _Papilio\r\nAlexanor_ (Fig. 141), and in Corsica and Sardinia is found\r\nthe _Papilio hospiton_, a rare species, nearly related to our\r\nswallow-tailed butterfly, but which we will here content ourselves\r\nwith mentioning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.--The scarce Swallow-tailed Butterfly\r\n(_Papilio podalirius_).]\r\n\r\nThe _Papilio podalirius_ (Fig. 142) is in form very analogous to\r\n_Papilio machaon_. It is of a rather pale yellow colour, marked with\r\nblack, as if singed. The lower wings have tails longer and narrower\r\nthan those of the latter, and are magnificently ornamented with blue\r\ncrescent-shaped spots and an orange-coloured eye bordered below with\r\nblue. This beautiful species is not rare at Montmorency, at Ile-Adam,\r\nand at St. Germain. It is said to have been taken in England, and is\r\ncalled the scarce Swallow-tail, but its capture is considered as very\r\nquestionable. It appears for the first time at the end of April, and\r\nfor the second in July and August. The _Parnassius Apollo_ (Fig. 143),\r\nis a beautiful butterfly, which appears in June and July, and is found\r\ncommonly enough in the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Cévennes. Its wings\r\nare of a yellowish white. The upper part of the fore wings presents\r\nfive nearly round black spots; the base and the costa, or front edge,\r\nof these wings are sprinkled with black atoms. The upper part of the\r\nhind wings presents two eyes of a vermilion red, the inner border\r\nfurnished with whitish hairs amply dotted with black, and marked\r\ntowards the extremity with two black spots. The under part of the fore\r\nwings is very similar to the upper. But the under part of the hind\r\nwings presents four red spots bordered by black, forming a transverse\r\nband near the base. The body is black, furnished with russety hairs,\r\nand the antennæ white, with the club black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.--Parnassius Apollo.]\r\n\r\nThe larva of the Apollo lives on saxifrages. To affect its\r\ntransformation it surrounds itself with a slight network of silk in\r\nwhich are confined one or more leaves. This caterpillar is thick,\r\nsmooth, cylindrical, and covered with small slightly hairy warts, and\r\nornamented on the first ring with a fleshy tentacle in the shape of a Y.\r\nThe chrysalis is conical, sprinkled over with a bluish efflorescence\r\nresembling the bloom on a plum. The _Parnassius Mnemosyne_ is found in\r\nthe month of June in the mountains of Dauphiné, in Switzerland, Sicily,\r\nHungary, Sweden, and in the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nIn the family of the _Pieridi_ we will mention many species remarkable\r\nin different ways, such as _Pieris cratægi_, the black-veined White,\r\n_Pieris brassicæ_, the Cabbage Butterfly, _Pieris napi_, _Pieris\r\ncallidice_, _Anthocharis cardamines_, the Orange-tip, _Rhodocera_\r\n(_Gonepteryx_) _rhamni_, and _Colias edusa_, or Clouded-yellow.\r\n_Pieris cratægi_ is white both above and below; the veins only of the\r\nwings are black, and become a little broader at the edge of the upper\r\nwings. These black veins on a rather transparent white ground make\r\nthis butterfly resemble a gauze veil, hence its French name, _le\r\ngaze_. It flies in spring and summer in meadows and gardens, but is\r\nnot generally common in England. In the first volume of his \"Travels\r\nin the North of Russia,\" Pallas relates that he saw insects of this\r\nspecies flying in great numbers in the environs of Winofka, and that\r\nhe at first took them for flakes of snow. The _Pieris cratægi_ fixes\r\nitself at sunset on flowers, where it is easily taken by the hand.\r\nDuring the day, on the contrary, it is difficult to catch. The larva,\r\nblack at first, afterwards assumes short yellow and white hairs, but\r\nit varies much. They live in companies, under a silky web, in which\r\nthey pass the winter. The leaves of the hawthorn, the sloe, the cherry\r\ntree, and of many other fruit trees, serve them for food. The pupa,\r\nyellow or white, and sometimes of both colours with little stripes and\r\nspots of black, is angular and terminated in front by a blunt point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.--Pieris brassicæ.]\r\n\r\nThe _Pieris brassicæ_ (Fig. 144), or Cabbage Butterfly, is perhaps the\r\ncommonest of all butterflies. From the beginning of spring till the\r\nend of autumn one sees it flying about everywhere, in the gardens,\r\nsometimes near and almost in the interior of towns. It is of a dull\r\nwhite, spotted and veined with black, and it can be seen at a long\r\ndistance, when flitting from flower to flower, in a meadow or garden.\r\nAnd so children wage desperate war against this flying prey. The\r\npursuit of the cabbage butterfly through the alleys of parks, along\r\nthe outskirts of woods, or on the green turf of meadows, is the first\r\njoy and the first passion of children in the country.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar (Fig. 145) is of a yellowish green, or rather greenish\r\nyellow, with three yellow longitudinal stripes separated by little\r\nblack points, from each of which springs a whitish hair. It lives in\r\ngroups on the cabbages in gardens, and on many other Cruciferæ. It is\r\nso voracious that it consumes in a day more than double its own\r\nweight, and, as it multiplies very quickly, commits great ravages in\r\nthe vegetable garden. Its pupa (Fig. 145) is of an ashy white, spotted\r\nwith black and yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.--Caterpillar and Chrysalis of Pieris brassicæ.]\r\n\r\nThe _Pieris rapæ_, or Small White Butterfly, differs but little from\r\nthe preceding except in size. The caterpillar, which lives on the\r\ncabbage, turnip, mignonette, nasturtium, &c., is green, with three\r\nyellow lines. It does not do these much harm. In France it is called\r\n_le ver du coeur_ (the heartworm), because it penetrates in between\r\nleaves pressed closely together.\r\n\r\nThe _Pieris napi_ (Fig. 146), the Green-veined White, is very like the\r\ntwo preceding, but the wings, the lower one especially, have\r\nunderneath broad veins, or bands, of a greenish colour. The _Pieris\r\ncallidice_, the wings of which are white spotted with black, is common\r\nin the Alps of France, in Savoy and Switzerland, and in the Pyrenees.\r\nIts caterpillar lives near the regions of perpetual snow, on small\r\ncruciferous plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.--Pieris napi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.--Anthocharis cardamines.]\r\n\r\nThe Orange-tips have, in the males, the extremity of the upper wings\r\nof a beautiful orange yellow. The rest of the wings is white in the\r\nonly British species (Fig. 147), which is to be seen in meadows from\r\nthe end of April till the end of May, and sulphur-coloured in some\r\nother species.\r\n\r\nOne species, extremely common, and which appears with but short\r\ninterruption from the beginning of spring till the end of autumn, is\r\nthe Brimstone Butterfly (_Rhodocera_ [_Gonepteryx_] _rhamni_). The\r\nwings are a lemon yellow, with an orange-coloured spot in the middle\r\nof each, and the front border terminated in a series of very small\r\niron-coloured spots. The body of the butterfly is black with silvery\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.--Thecla betulæ.]\r\n\r\nThe _Colias edusa_, or Clouded-yellow, so called from the colour of\r\nthe upper part of its wings, is not uncommon in meadows and fields in\r\nearly autumn throughout Europe. The upper side of the wings is of a\r\nmarigold yellow; the upper ones having towards the middle a large spot\r\nof black. At the extremity of each wing is a broad black band,\r\ncontinuous in the case of the male, interrupted by yellow spots in the\r\nfemale. The back of the body is yellow; the legs, as well as the\r\nantennæ, rosy.\r\n\r\nThe family of the _Lycænidæ_ comprises a great number of species, some\r\nof which we will mention.\r\n\r\nThe _Theclæ_, or Hair-streaks, which the French call _Petits\r\nPorte-queues_, on account of the tails which grace the hind margin of\r\nthe hind wings, inhabit woods, their larvæ feeding, according to the\r\nspecies, on the birch, the oak, the plum-tree, the bramble, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _Thecla betulæ_ (Fig. 148), or Brown Hair-streak, is somewhat rare\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\nThe Purple Hair-streak (_Thecla quercus_, Fig. 149), which Geoffroy\r\ncalls the \"_Porte-queue bleu à une bande blanche_,\" is not rare in\r\nwoods; but it is very difficult to catch, as it flies nearly always by\r\ncouples at the tops of trees. We still further represent here the\r\nBlack Hair-streak (_Thecla pruni_, Fig. 150), and the Green\r\nHair-streak (_Thecla rubi_, Fig. 151).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.--Thecla quercus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.--Thecla pruni.]\r\n\r\nIn the meadows are found the Copper Butterflies; butterflies with\r\nwings of a bright, tawny colour, with black marks on the upper side.\r\nSuch is the _Polyommatus_ (_Lycæna_) _phlæas_ (Fig. 152), which is\r\nvery common from the end of May until late in the autumn. The upper\r\npart of the wing is coppery, spotted with black, the under side of a\r\ngrey colour, sprinkled with small eyes, and bordered by a zone of\r\ntawny spots. Linnæus counted forty-two little black eyes on the under\r\nside of the wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--Thecla rubi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.--Small Copper (_Polyommatus_ [_Lycæna_]\r\n_phlæas_).]\r\n\r\nWe also figure _Polyommatus_ (_Lycæna_) _virgaureæ_ (Fig. 153), and\r\n_Polyommatus_ (_Lycæna_) _gordius_ (Fig. 154), neither of which occurs\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\nIn the meadows, the gardens, and the lucerne and clover fields, are\r\nfound the charming Blue Butterflies, the wings on the upper side, in\r\nthe majority of instances, blue in the case of the males, brown in the\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nThey comprise the genus _Lycæna_, or, as it is frequently called,\r\n_Polyommatus_,[49] though that name is now generally given to the\r\npreceding. We will content ourselves here by giving drawings of a few\r\nspecies of the genus, namely, the _Lycæna (Polyommatus) Corydon_, or\r\nBlue Argus (Fig. 155), which is not uncommon wherever there is chalk,\r\nin May and August; the _Lycæna (Polyommatus) battus_, or Brown Argus\r\n(Fig. 156), which does not occur here; the _Lycæna (Polyommatus)\r\nægan_, which flies about our sandy heaths.\r\n\r\n    [49] It may not be out of place to remark that although both\r\n    these generic names are applied, sometimes to the one,\r\n    sometimes to the other of these genera, the genus named in the\r\n    text _Polyommatus_ and that called _Lycæna_ are never\r\n    considered identical. When either name is applied to the one,\r\n    it is not at the same time applied to the other.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.--Polyommatus (Lycæna) virgaureæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.--Polyommatus (Lycæna) gordius.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.--Lycæna (Polyommatus) Corydon.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of this genus, as also those of the preceding, are\r\nbroad and flat, resembling wood-lice, with very short legs, and are\r\nvery slow in their movements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.--Lycæna (Polyommatus) battus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.--Lycæna (Polyommatus) ægon.]\r\n\r\nIn the numerous family of the _Vanessidæ_ are placed the beautiful\r\nspecies known as the large and small Tortoise-shell, the Peacock, &c.\r\n\r\nThe large Tortoise-shell Butterfly (_Vanessa polychloros_, Fig. 158)\r\nhas the wings of a tawny colour above, and of a blackish brown below,\r\nwith darker spots, bordered by a black band, with a stripe of\r\nyellowish colour running down the middle. It is found in July and\r\nSeptember on the oak, the elm, the willow, and many fruit trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.--Large Tortoise-shell Butterfly (_Vanessa\r\npolychloros_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.--Larva and chrysalis of the large\r\nTortoise-shell (_Vanessa polychloros_).]\r\n\r\nThe larva (Fig. 159) is bluish or brownish, with an orange-coloured\r\nlateral line, bristling with yellowish hairs. The chrysalis, which is\r\nangular, and of a red tint, is ornamented with golden metallic spots.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.--Small Tortoise-shell Butterfly (_Vanessa\r\nurticæ_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.--Peacock Butterfly (_Vanessa Io_).]\r\n\r\nWe give here a drawing of the small Tortoise-shell (_Vanessa urticæ_,\r\nFig. 160), which resembles the preceding, but is smaller. Its\r\ncaterpillar, bristly, blackish, with four yellowish lines, lives in\r\ncompanies on the nettle. The Peacock Butterfly (_Vanessa Io_, Fig.\r\n161) is very easily recognised by the peacock's eyes--to the number of\r\nfour, one on each wing--which have gained for it the name it bears.\r\nThe eye on the upper wings is reddish in the middle and surrounded by\r\na yellowish circle. That on the lower ones is blackish, with a grey\r\ncircle round it, and contains bluish spots. The upper part of the\r\nwings is of a russety brown, the under part blackish. This _Vanessa_\r\nis met with in the woods, in lucerne fields, and in gardens. Its spiny\r\ncaterpillar is of a shiny black with white dots, and lives in\r\ncompanies on nettles. The chrysalis, at first greenish, then brownish,\r\nis ornamented with golden spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.--Camberwell Beauty (_Vanessa Antiopa_).]\r\n\r\nThe _Vanessa Antiopa_ (Fig. 162), one of the greatest of entomological\r\nrarities in England, is not very common in the woods about Paris, but\r\nit is frequently found in the environs of Bordeaux, and, above all, at\r\nthe Grande Chartreuse (in the department of Isère). The Parisian\r\ncollectors go as far as Fontainebleau in pursuit of this beautiful\r\nspecies, with angular wings, of a dark purple black, with a yellowish\r\nor whitish band on the hind border and a succession of blue spots\r\nabove it. The caterpillar is black, and bristly, with red spots. It\r\nlives in companies on the birch, the aspen, the elm, and different\r\nkinds of willows. The pupa is blackish, sprinkled with a bluish\r\npowder, and has ferruginous-coloured dots. The butterfly, which\r\nemerges from the chrysalis in July and August, is found, after\r\nhybernation, at the end of February and until May. It flies very\r\nrapidly, and is very difficult to catch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.--Red Admiral Butterfly (_Vanessa Atalanta_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--Painted Lady Butterfly (_Vanessa_ [_Cynthia_]\r\n_cardui_).]\r\n\r\nThe Red Admiral Butterfly (_Vanessa Atalanta_, Fig. 163) has bands of\r\nvermilion colour on the upper side of its wings, which are black\r\nabove, and variegated beneath with different colours. The caterpillar\r\nis bristly and blackish, with a succession of spots of lemon-colour\r\non its sides. It lives in solitude on the stinging-nettle (_Urtica\r\ndioica_). Its chrysalis is blackish, with golden spots. This\r\nmagnificent insect is common at the end of summer, and easy to catch.\r\nIf missed once it comes back again almost immediately, and almost\r\nalights on the net of the collector.\r\n\r\nThe Painted Lady (_Vanessa_ [_Cynthia_] _cardui_, Fig. 164) owes its\r\nvernacular name to the beauty of its colours. The upper wings are\r\ncovered above with tawny spots, rather cerise coloured towards the\r\ninterior, and with white spots on the hind margin towards the tip of\r\nthe wing; the whole on a lightish ground. The lower wings are of a\r\nreddish tawny colour with many black spots, a circular row of which\r\nborders the wing. The caterpillar is bristly, brownish, with yellow\r\nlateral broken lines. It lives in solitude on many species of thistle,\r\non the artichoke, the milfoil or yarrow, &c. It makes for itself a\r\nweb, rather like a spider's nest, and lives therein. The chrysalis is\r\ngreyish, with numerous golden dots. The perfect insect shows itself\r\nalmost without interruption, from spring till autumn. It flies\r\nrapidly, and in certain seasons is abundant.\r\n\r\nThe _Vanessa (Grapta) C. album_ (Fig. 165), or Comma Butterfly, is\r\ncommon in parts of England. Above, its wings are tawny, spotted with\r\nblack. Below, they are more or less brown, with different tints, and\r\nsometimes a little blue. On the under side of the lower wings is a\r\nwhite spot of the form of a C. \"This spot,\" says old Geoffroy, \"caused\r\nthis butterfly to have the name of _gamma_ given to it, and its colour\r\nof _Diable enrhumé_ (_sic_), as also the singular cut of its wings,\r\nhas caused it to be called by others _Robert le Diable_.\" Its\r\ncaterpillar lives on the nettle, the honeysuckle, the currant, the\r\nhazel, and the elm. It is of a reddish brown, with a white band on the\r\nback. Réaumur calls it the Beadle, comparing it to the church beadles,\r\nwho usually dress in glaring colours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.--The Comma Butterfly (_Vanessa C. album_).]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant _Vanessæ_, of which we have just briefly described some\r\nremarkable species, have been the cause of superstitious terror. This\r\nmust at first sight seem incredible, but it has arisen thus: When they\r\nhave just quitted the pupa, a red-coloured liquid drops from them. If\r\na great many butterflies are hatched at the same time, and in the\r\nsame place, the ground becomes, as it were, sprinkled with drops of\r\nblood. Hence the origin of some of those pretended _showers of blood_,\r\nwhich, at different periods, have terrified the ignorant, too much\r\nimbued with religious superstitions.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the month of July, 1608, one of these supposed\r\nshowers of blood fell on the outskirts of Aix, in Provence, and this\r\n_rain_ extended for the distance of half a league from the town. Some\r\npriests of the town deceived themselves, or, desirous of turning to\r\naccount the credulity of the people, did not hesitate to attribute\r\nthis event to Satanic agency. Fortunately, a learned man, M. de\r\nPeiresc, who was not only well versed in the knowledge of ancient\r\nliterature, but who was, moreover, familiar with the natural sciences,\r\ndiscovered that a prodigious multitude of butterflies were flying\r\nabout in the places which were thus miraculously covered with blood.\r\nHe collected some chrysalides and put them into a box, and letting\r\nthem hatch there, observed the blood-like liquid, and hastened to make\r\nit known to the friends of the miraculous. He established the fact\r\nthat the supposed drops of blood were only found in cavities, in\r\ninterstices, under the copings of walls, &c., and never on the surface\r\nof stones turned upwards; and proved by these observations that they\r\nwere drops of a red liquid deposited by the butterflies.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the reassuring remarks of the learned Peiresc,\r\nthe people in the outskirts of Aix continued to feel a genuine terror\r\nat the sight of these tears of blood which stained the soil. Peiresc\r\nattributes to this same cause some other showers of blood related by\r\nhistorians, and which took place about the same season. Such was a\r\nshower which was supposed to have fallen in the time of Childebert, at\r\nParis, and in a house in the territory of Senlis. Such again was a\r\nso-called bloody shower which showed itself towards the end of June,\r\nduring the reign of King Robert of France. Réaumur points out the\r\nlarge Tortoise-shell as being the most capable of spreading these\r\nsorts of alarms, founded on a deplorable ignorance and the spirit of\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\n\"Thousands,\" says he, \"change into pupæ towards the end of May or the\r\nbeginning of June. Before their transformation they leave the trees,\r\noften fastening themselves to walls, and, making their way into\r\ncountry-houses, they suspend themselves to the frames of doors, &c. If\r\nthe butterflies which come out of them towards the end of June or the\r\nbeginning of July were all to fly together, there would be enough of\r\nthem to form little clouds or swarms, and consequently there would be\r\nenough to cover the stones in certain localities with spots of a\r\nblood-red colour, and to make those who only seek to terrify\r\nthemselves, and to see prodigies in everything, believe that during\r\nthe night it had rained blood.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.--White Admiral (_Limenitis sibilla_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.--Limenitis camilla.]\r\n\r\nIn the family of _Nymphalidæ_, we will first mention the White Admiral\r\n(Fig. 166). The upper side of its wings is of a dark brown, almost\r\nblack, traversed in the middle by a white band divided into spots very\r\nclose to each other. The lower part of the wings is ferruginous, with\r\na band and spots of white, as on the upper, besides which it has a\r\ndouble hinder transverse row of black dots. These dots are followed on\r\nthe hind wings by some white spots, and the whole of the inner margin\r\nis of a glossy ashy blue, with the base spotted with black. This\r\nbutterfly is not rare in the month of July in woods in the south of\r\nEngland, where it flies round and settles upon the branches of the\r\nunderwood. The caterpillar is of a delicate green, with a lateral\r\nwhite stripe, and rather bristly. It feeds on honeysuckle. The pupa is\r\nangular, of greenish colour, with golden spots.\r\n\r\nThe _Limenitis camilla_ (Fig. 167), of which the black on the wings is\r\nshot with blue, is not found in England.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July the _Apatura ilia_ (Fig. 168) and the Purple\r\nEmperor (_Apatura iris_), sylvan insects of strong flight, whose wings\r\nare beautifully shot with violet blue when examined in certain\r\nlights--the latter resembling _Ilia_, but wanting the eye-like spots\r\non the front wings--are met with. _Iris_ only is found in this\r\ncountry. Both species occur in the environs of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.--Apatura ilia.]\r\n\r\nThe _Charaxes jasius_ (Fig. 169), which is found along the whole of\r\nthe Mediterranean coast, has its lower wings terminated in two points,\r\nwhence the peasants call this butterfly the _Pacha with two tails_.\r\nThe upper part of its wings is of a brown colour of changing hues. The\r\nhind margin of the fore wings has along it a tawny band with a fine\r\nblack line running round. The hind wings have their hinder margin\r\nblack, and garnished with a little white fringe. The two tails are\r\nblack, and the groove of the inner margin is of an ashy grey. The\r\nunderneath of the wings is ferruginous, with spots of an olive brown\r\nset in a framework of white towards the base.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, and flat like a slug, with four yellow horns\r\nbordered with red (Fig. 170). It lives on the arbutus, a shrub common\r\nenough on the hills and mountains of the coast of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.--Charaxes jasius.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.--Larva of Charaxes jasius about to change to\r\na pupa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.--Erebia Euryale.]\r\n\r\nTo the family of the _Satyridi_ belongs the _Erebia Euryale_ (Fig.\r\n171), which is found in the month of July in sub-alpine regions; the\r\n_Chionobas aello_ (Fig. 172), which is found in the Alps of\r\nSwitzerland, of the Tyrol, and of Savoy, and which is common enough,\r\nin the month of July, on the summit of Montanvers, near the _mer de\r\nglace_; the _Satyrus janira_, or Meadow Brown (Fig. 173), which is\r\nvery common, in the months of June and July, in woods and fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.--Chionobas aello.]\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to the second section of Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.--Meadow brown (_Satyrus_ [_Hipparchia_]\r\n_janira_).]\r\n\r\nIt contains _those whose flight in the majority of species is nocturnal\r\nor by twilight, but by day in some species. The antennæ are more or\r\nless swollen out in the middle or before their extremities, and,\r\nindependently of that, sometimes prismatic, sometimes cylindrical,\r\nsometimes pectinated or indented. The body--which was small in\r\ncomparison to the wings, and which was remarkably thin between the\r\nthorax and the abdomen in the first section of Lepidoptera--is in this\r\nsection very much larger in proportion to the wings, and is not drawn\r\ntightly in between the thorax and the abdomen. The wings are horizontal\r\nor slightly inclined when the insect is at rest; the upper then cover\r\nthe lower, which are generally comparatively short and kept back by a\r\nbridle on the first, in the case of the males only._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.--Sesia apiformis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.--Six-spot Burnet Moth (_Zygæna filipendulæ_).]\r\n\r\nWe will take the genus _Sesia_ as the representative of the _Sesiidæ_.\r\nThese singular insects have membranous wings, and resemble various\r\nspecies of Hymenoptera. The largest species is the _Sesia apiformis_\r\n(Fig. 174), that is, bee-like, which is found in this country, resting\r\non the trunks of willows and poplar-trees, from the end of May till the\r\nmiddle of July. It resembles a hornet, and is of the same size and has\r\nthe same colours; only they are not quite so bright. When this moth is\r\njust hatched its wings are ferruginous; but its scales, light and\r\ncaducous, fall as soon as the insect begins to fly. The caterpillar,\r\nwhich lives in the trunks or roots of willows and poplar-trees, is of a\r\nyellowish colour. The pupa is long, of a brownish colour, enclosed in a\r\ncocoon composed of agglutinated saw-dust, the product of the\r\ncaterpillar's erosions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.--Cocoon of the Zygæna filipendulæ.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of summer the meadows are frequented by moths, with\r\nbrilliant black and velvety wings, marked with red, which fly heavily,\r\nand only for a short time together. They remain motionless during the\r\ngreat heat of the day. These are the _Zygænæ_, or Burnets, of the\r\nfamily of the _Zygænidæ_. The Ram Sphinx of Geoffroy, or the Six-spot\r\nBurnet Moth (_Zygæna filipendulæ_, Fig. 175), is common from the end\r\nof June till the beginning of August. Its legs, antennæ, head, and\r\nbody are black and rather hairy; its upper wings are of a brilliant\r\nbluish green, with six spots of a beautiful red on each, bordered by a\r\nlittle green. The caterpillar is yellow, spotted with black; its\r\ncocoon is boat-shaped, with longitudinal furrows, and is straw colour\r\n(Fig. 176).\r\n\r\nNext to _Zygæna_ comes _Procris_, the species of which fly during the\r\nday in damp fields. We will mention particularly the _Procris\r\nstatices_ (Fig. 177), which is plentiful enough where it occurs\r\nbetween the middle of June and the middle of July, on the sides of\r\nhills. Its fore wings, antennæ, and the whole of its body, are of a\r\nblue green above. The same wings are of the same colour below, and the\r\nsurfaces of the lower ones are of an ashy brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.--The Forester (_Procris_ [_Ino_] _statices_).]\r\n\r\nThe Sphinges, that is, those species that form the family of the\r\n_Sphingidæ_, have received this general name from the attitude which\r\ntheir caterpillars often assume. Raising the fore part of the body,\r\nwhich attitude resembles the Sphinx of mythology, they keep for a very\r\nlong time this state of immobility. They fly very rapidly and briskly,\r\nand only make their appearance for the most part after sunset. The\r\ncaterpillars, which in this group are without hair, and have almost\r\nalways a horn on the eleventh segment of the body, metamorphose\r\nthemselves in the earth, without forming hard cocoons. The chrysalis\r\nare sometimes enveloped in a very slight shell, or cocoon, which when\r\nit exists is formed of particles of earth or of vegetable _débris_\r\nbound together by threads. This family comprises species generally\r\nremarkable for their size and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Macroglossa_ contains some species which fly rapidly and\r\nfor a long time together during the day. We will mention particularly\r\nthe Humming-bird Sphinx (_Macroglossa stellatarum_). This moth (Fig.\r\n178) has attracted the attention of all who have ever spent much time\r\nin a flower garden. In Burgundy the children call it _bird-fly_. In\r\npassing from one flower to another it has brisk and rapid movements,\r\nbut it remains suspended in the air before each; it does not alight\r\nupon any, it is always flying, thrusting its long trunk the while\r\ninto the corollæ of flowers, counterbalancing the action of its weight\r\nby the continuous vibration of its wings.\r\n\r\nWe will describe in a few words this robust inhabitant of the air,\r\nthis charming _bird-fly_. The _Macroglossa stellatarum_ shows itself\r\nduring the whole of the fine season, and till the middle of autumn, in\r\nour climate. It often penetrates in the middle of the day into our\r\nhouses, and knocking itself against the window-panes, falls an easy\r\nprey to children. Its front wings are of an ashy brown, of changing\r\nhues above, with three black, transverse, undulating lines. The lower,\r\nshorter than the others, are of a rusty-yellow colour. All the wings\r\nare yellowish below near the body, ferruginous in the middle, and of a\r\ndark brown at their extremities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.--Humming-bird Hawk-Moth (_Macroglossa\r\nstellatarum_).]\r\n\r\nThe body is long, brown, hairy, and terminating in a tuft of\r\ndivergent hairs, reminding one of a bird's tail. It is for this reason\r\nthat it has been called by the French _Sphinx Moineau_, or Sparrow\r\nSphinx. This resemblance is so great, that Mr. Bates, in his book on\r\nthe Amazons, says he often shot species of this genus in mistake for\r\nhumming-birds. The caterpillar of this remarkable Lepidopteron (Fig.\r\n179) is of a pale green, with eight transversal rows of small white\r\ndots and four longitudinal rows, of which two are white and two\r\nyellowish. It has a dark blue horn, with an orange-coloured tip. It\r\nlives on different species of bed-straw, but by preference on the\r\n_Galium mollugo_. Before its metamorphosis, it encloses itself in a\r\nshapeless cocoon, made of the _débris_ of leaves held together by\r\nthreads, and placed on the surface of the ground. The pupa (Fig. 180)\r\nis of a light grey, sprinkled over with brown dots, and striped with\r\nblack. Its skin is so thin and transparent that one can follow it\r\nthrough all the phases of transformation to the imago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.--Caterpillar of Humming-bird Hawk-Moth\r\n(_Macroglossa stellatarum_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.--Pupa of Macroglossa stellatarum.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Deilephila_ is composed of species whose flight is rapid,\r\nand after sunset. Such are the _Deilephila euphorbiæ_, the Oleander\r\nHawk-Moth (_Deilephila_ [_Chærocampa_] _nerii_), and the large Elephant\r\nHawk-Moth (_Deilephila_ [_Chærocampa_] _elpenor_).\r\n\r\nThe _Deilephila euphorbiæ_ (Fig. 181) has the upper wings of a reddish\r\ngrey, with three spots of greenish or olive colour along the costa, or\r\nfront margin, and a broad black oblique band along the hind margin.\r\nThe lower wings are red, with the base black, and a transverse black\r\nband towards the edge; they have, moreover, a large round white spot\r\non the inside; beneath the wings are red, as also is the body, which\r\nis covered above with greenish hairs. This species is exceedingly rare\r\nhere, but is plentiful on the Continent during the months of June and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.--Deilephila euphorbiæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.--Larva of Deilephila euphorbiæ.]\r\n\r\nThe larva (Fig. 182) is one of the most remarkable of the genus on\r\naccount of the splendour and the vividness of its colours, and appears\r\nto be covered with varnish. It has a number of small yellow dots very\r\nclose to each other on a glossy black ground, which are ranged in\r\ncircles. On each side of the body are two longitudinal rows of spots\r\ngenerally of the same colour as the dots, and a narrow band of carmine\r\nruns down the middle of the back, and a similar band, which is\r\nintersected by yellow, is to be seen above the legs. This caterpillar\r\nis almost always found on the Cyprus-leafed spurge. It is found first\r\nat the end of June. Generally the chrysalis passes through the winter,\r\nand the moth emerges in the following year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.--Deilephila (Chærocampa) nerii.]\r\n\r\nThe _Deilephila (Chærocampa) nerii_ (Fig. 183), or Oleander Hawk-Moth,\r\nis a charming species almost peculiar to hot countries, where the\r\nshrub from which it derives its name grows spontaneously--that is to\r\nsay, in Africa, in the southern parts of Asia, in Greece, in Spain,\r\n&c. Carried forward by its rapid flight, and assisted by atmospheric\r\ncurrents, these beautiful insects sometimes come accidentally into the\r\ncountries of Central Europe. They have been met with many times in\r\nParis, in the garden of the Luxembourg, where the oleander is\r\ncultivated under glass. But those which are hatched in the environs\r\nof Paris never reproduce their species, on account of the coldness of\r\nthe climate. Both larva and imago--the former on periwinkle--_have_\r\nbeen found in the same locality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.--Larva of Deilephila (Chærocampa) nerii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.--Pupa of Deilephila (Chærocampa) nerii.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this species (Fig. 184) is one of those called by\r\nthe French _Cochonnes_, because their two first rings, which are\r\nretractile and drawn back under the third when the insect is at rest,\r\ntaper in such a way as to resemble the snout of a pig, hence the\r\nEnglish name \"Elephant,\" when they change their place or are engaged\r\nin eating. It is of a beautiful green, with white stripes and dots on\r\nthe sides, and marked on the third segment with two large spots like\r\neyes, of an azure blue, encircled with black, and having white pupils.\r\nA short orange-coloured horn rises at the extremity of the body. A few\r\ndays before its transformation, this caterpillar entirely loses its\r\nrich livery, it becomes brown on the back, and of a dirty yellow on\r\nthe rest of its body, and constructs for itself a cocoon at the foot\r\nof the shrub on which it lived, with the _débris_ of leaves fastened\r\ntogether with threads.\r\n\r\nThe cocoon contains a chrysalis (Fig. 185) of a hazel brown,\r\ndelicately streaked with a darker brown, and with a very conspicuous\r\nblack spot on each of its stigmata.\r\n\r\nThe Elephant Hawk-Moth (_Deilephila_ [_Chærocampa_] _elpenor_, Fig. 186)\r\nis not rare during the month of June. Its fore wings are purple red,\r\nglossy above, with three bands of a light olive green, having at the\r\nbase a small black spot. The inner margin is garnished with white\r\nhairs. The hind wings are of a dark rose colour above, with the base\r\nblack, and the hind margin bordered with white. The four wings are\r\nrose coloured below, with the costa and the middle of an olive green;\r\nthe upper ones have their interior border tinged with a blackish\r\ncolour. The body is rose colour, with two longitudinal bands of an\r\nolive green over the abdomen, and five diverging lines of this colour\r\non the thorax. The sides of the abdomen have along them a double\r\nseries of yellowish points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.--Deilephila (Chærocampa) elpenor.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this sphinx (Fig. 187) is of a dark brown,\r\ndelicately striped with black. Two grey lines run down each side of\r\nits body, and on the fourth and fifth segments are two black eyes\r\nbordered by light violet. This caterpillar is found most often on\r\ncertain kinds of _Epilobium_, but will also eat of the vine, fuchsia,\r\nand bed-straw. It must be sought in damp places, by streams and ponds,\r\nfrom the end of July till September. It constructs on the surface of\r\nthe soil a shapeless cocoon with moss and dry leaves, which it fastens\r\ntogether with some silky threads. Its pupa (Fig. 188), of a yellowish\r\nbrown, has short bristles on the rings of the abdomen. The caterpillar\r\npossesses in the highest degree the retractile power which has gained\r\nfor certain species of this genus their popular names. The Privet\r\nSphinx (_Sphinx ligustri_, Fig. 189) has its upper wings rather\r\nnarrow, about two inches long, of a reddish grey, and veined with\r\nblack above, with the middle of a dark brown, the inner margin with\r\nrose-coloured hairs, and the hind margin having two whitish flexuous\r\nlines running along it. The hind wings are of a rose tint, with three\r\nblack bands. The wings are of a reddish grey below with a common black\r\nband. The abdomen has black and rose-coloured rings above, and in the\r\nmiddle a brownish band wholly divided by a black line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.--Larva of Deilephila (Chærocampa) elpenor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.--Pupa of Deilephila (Chærocampa) elpenor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.--Privet Hawk-Moth (_Sphinx ligustri_).]\r\n\r\nThis species is very common in all parts of Europe. One finds it in\r\ngardens from June to September. Of all the caterpillars of the genus\r\n_Sphinx_, this is the one which, by its attitude when in a state of\r\nrepose, most resembles the sphinx of fable, from which the genus has\r\nderived its name. It is of fine apple green, with seven oblique\r\nstripes, half violet and half white, placed on each side of its body,\r\nand three or four small white spots beyond these stripes. The stigmata\r\nare orange, the head is green, bordered with black. The extremity of\r\nthe body is surrounded by a smooth horn, black above, yellow below\r\n(Fig. 190). This beautiful caterpillar is not rare. It lives on a\r\ngreat number of trees and shrubs, but it is principally on the privet,\r\nthe lilac, and the ash tree, that it must be looked for. Three or four\r\ndays before it buries itself in the earth to change itself into a\r\nchrysalis, its beautiful colours grow dim. During the month of June\r\nand September is found the Convolvulus Sphinx (_Sphinx convolvuli_,\r\nFig. 192), with brown wings, and with the abdomen striped with\r\ntransverse bands alternately black and red. The caterpillar of this\r\nspecies, which presents a great number of varieties, lives on many\r\nkinds of _Convolvuli_, but particularly on the field species. It is\r\ngenerally rare here, but occasionally abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.--Larva of the Privet Hawk-Moth (_Sphinx\r\nligustri_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.--Pupa of Sphinx ligustri.]\r\n\r\nIt is to the genus _Acherontia_ that a well-known moth belongs. We\r\nrefer to the Death's-head Moth (_Acherontia atropos_). It is the\r\nlargest species of hawk-moth. This insect presents, roughly marked out\r\nin light yellow, on the black ground of its thorax, a human skull.\r\nThis funeral symbol, joined to the plaintive cry which this moth\r\nemits when frightened, has sometimes inspired terror into the whole\r\npopulation of a country. The appearance of this moth in certain\r\ncountries having coincided with the invasion of an epidemic disease,\r\nsome thought they saw in this doleful sylph of the night the messenger\r\nof death. The _Acherontia atropos_ plays a great part in the\r\nsuperstitions which are believed in by the country folk in England.\r\nOne hears it said in country places that this ominous inhabitant of\r\nthe air is in league with the witches, and that it goes and murmurs\r\ninto their ears with its sad and plaintive voice the name of the\r\nperson whom death is soon to carry off. In spite of its ominous\r\nlivery, the _Atropos_ does not come from Hades; it is no envoy of\r\ndeath, bringing sadness and mourning. It does not bring us news of\r\nanother world; it tells us, on the contrary, that Nature can people\r\nevery hour; that it was her will to console them for their sadness, to\r\ngrant to the twilight and to the night the same winged wanderers\r\nwhich are at once the delight and ornament of the hours of light and\r\nof day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.--The Convolvulus Sphinx (_Sphinx convolvuli_).]\r\n\r\nThis is the mission of science, to dissipate the thousands of\r\nprejudices and dangerous superstitions which mislead ignorant people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.--Death's-head Hawk-Moth (_Acherontia atropos_).]\r\n\r\nThis moth has the front wings of a blackish brown colour, having\r\nlighter irregular bands varied with brown and grey, above and below.\r\nOn the middle of the front wing there is a well-defined white dot. The\r\nhind wings have two black bands, the upper narrower than the lower\r\none; the rest of the wing is a fine yellow. The abdomen has likewise\r\nfrom five to six yellow and as many black bands; in the middle is a\r\nlong blackish longitudinal band. This moth is not very rare, and may\r\nbe found in autumn. Its flight is heavy, and, as we have said, the\r\ninsect never flies till after sunset. If caught, or when teased, it\r\nutters a cry which is very audible.\r\n\r\nThe death's-head hawk-moth would be a very inoffensive being if it did\r\nnot make its way into bee-hives, in order to steal the honey, of which\r\nit is excessively fond. It is to no purpose that the bees dart their\r\nstings at the intruder, they only blunt them against its thick skin,\r\nand soon, terrified at its presence, disperse on all sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.--Larva of the Death's-head Hawk-Moth\r\n(_Acherontia atropos_).]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the _Acherontia atropos_ (Fig. 194) is the largest\r\nof all European caterpillars. It attains to as much as four and a half\r\ninches in length by eight lines in diameter. Its colour is lemon\r\nyellow, which changes into green on the sides and belly. From the\r\nfourth to the tenth ring inclusively it is ornamented laterally with\r\nseven oblique bands of an azure blue, which are tinted with violet,\r\nand bordered with white on the side. These bands joining together over\r\nthe back of each segment resemble so many _chevrons_ placed parallel\r\nto each other. The body is, moreover, dotted with black. At its\r\nextremity is a yellow horn, curved back like a hook, and covered with\r\ntubercles. The head is green, and marked laterally with a black\r\nstripe. It lives chiefly on the potato, and the _Lycium barbarum_,\r\nsometimes called the tea-tree, a shrub belonging to the _Solanaceæ_.\r\nIt buries itself in the earth to change into a chrysalis (Fig. 195) of\r\na bright chestnut brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.--Chrysalis of the Death's-head Hawk-Moth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.--Lime Hawk-Moth (_Smerinthus tiliæ_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.--Larva of the Lime Hawk-Moth (_Smerinthus\r\ntiliæ_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.--Eyed Hawk-Moth (_Smerinthus ocellatus_).]\r\n\r\nWe will mention still further, in the family of the _Sphingidæ_, three\r\nspecies of the genus _Smerinthus_, which fly heavily and by twilight.\r\n\r\nThe Lime-tree Hawk-moth (_Smerinthus tiliæ_, Fig. 196) has its upper\r\nwings grey with some shades of green, and moreover, in the middle of\r\nthe wing an irregular band of a brownish green colour. The thorax,\r\ncovered with hairs, is grey, with three green longitudinal bands. The\r\nabdomen is also grey. The moth flies heavily after sunset, and is\r\nfound on the trunks of trees during the months of May and June. The\r\nlarva (Fig. 197) is glaucous green dotted with yellow, and marked on\r\neach side with seven oblique lines of the same colours. Its wrinkly\r\nhorn is blue above and yellow below. It is found on the lime and the\r\nelm. It buries itself at the foot of the tree on which it has fed to\r\nchange into a chrysalis without making a cocoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.--Poplar Hawk-Moth (_Smerinthus populi_).]\r\n\r\nWe will content ourselves by here giving drawings of two other species\r\nof the same genus: the Eyed Hawk-Moth (_Smerinthus ocellatus_, Fig.\r\n198), which is not rare during the months of May and sometimes August,\r\nthe caterpillar of which lives on the leaves of willows, poplars, and\r\nfruit-trees; and the Poplar Hawk-Moth (_Smerinthus populi_, Fig. 199),\r\nwhose caterpillar (Fig. 200) lives on the poplar, the aspen, and\r\nsometimes on the willow and birch.\r\n\r\nThe division of _Bombycina_ contains the largest of moths, and at the\r\nsame time species of a middle and small size. These moths take no\r\nnourishment, and live only for a short time--long enough to propagate\r\ntheir species. They rarely fly during the day, only showing themselves\r\nin the evening. The group is dispersed over nearly all parts of the\r\nworld, and may be recognised by the antennæ generally being cut like\r\nthe teeth of a comb in the males, by their thick, strong bodies, and,\r\nin the majority of cases, by their large head, by their wings more or\r\nless large, and by their heavy flight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.--Larva of the Poplar Hawk-Moth (_Smerinthus\r\npopuli_).]\r\n\r\nIn the _Bombycina_ are found the genera _Sericaria_, _Attacus_,\r\n_Bombyx_, _Orgyia_, _Liparis_, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is to the genus _Bombyx_ that the silkworm belongs, that celebrated\r\ninsect called by Linnæus _Bombyx mori_, a name which reminds us at the\r\nsame time of its most ancient denomination, and of the mulberry tree,\r\non which these caterpillars feed.\r\n\r\nM. Guérin-Méneville has called the silkworm \"the dog of insects,\" for\r\nit has been domesticated from the most ancient times, and has become\r\ndeprived of great part of its strength in the process. The moth of the\r\nsilkworm can no longer keep its position in the air, or on the leaves\r\nof the mulberry when they are agitated by the wind. It can no longer\r\nprotect itself, under the leaves, from the burning heat of the sun and\r\nfrom its enemies. The female, always motionless, seems to be ignorant\r\nof the fact that she has wings. The male no longer flies; he flutters\r\nround his companion, without quitting the ground. It ought, however,\r\nto be possessed in the wild state of a sufficiently powerful flight.\r\nM. Ch. Martins found that after three generations reared in the open\r\nair, the males recovered their lost power.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the different phases of the life of the silkworm\r\nand the rearing of this precious insect, we will notice the origin and\r\nprogress of the silk trade, one of the most important branches of\r\ncommerce in the South of Europe and in the East.\r\n\r\nThe native country of the silkworm is not better known than that of\r\nthe greater number of plants and animals which form the staple of\r\nagricultural industry. Probably, however, it was China. It was\r\ncertainly in this vast empire that long since the business of\r\nfabricating silk began. One reads the following in \"L'Histoire\r\ngénérale de la Chine,\" by M. Mailla:--\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor Hoang-ti, who lived 2,600 years before our era, wished\r\nthat Si-ling-chi, his wife, should contribute to the happiness of his\r\npeople; he charged her to study the silkworm, and to try to utilise\r\nits threads. Si-ling-chi caused a great quantity of these insects to\r\nbe collected, which she fed herself in a place destined exclusively\r\nfor the purpose; she not only discovered the means of rearing them,\r\nbut still further the manner of winding off their silk and of\r\nemploying it in the manufacture of fabrics.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, however, if the learned men who composed this recital\r\ndid not collect under the reign of the emperor Hoang-ti all the events\r\nand all the discoveries whose dates were lost in the obscurity of the\r\nmost remote periods of history. Is not the Empress Si-ling-chi a\r\nmythical person? a sort of Chinese Ceres, to whom, under the title of\r\ngoddess of the silkworm, they then raised altars?\r\n\r\nHere, at any rate, is how Duhalde[50] analyses the recital of the\r\nChinese annalists on the remarkable fact of the introduction of the\r\nsilkworm and its rich products into the Chinese empire:--\r\n\r\n    [50] \"Description de la Chine,\" tome ii., p. 205.\r\n\r\n\"Up to the time of this queen (Si-ling-chi),\" says he, \"when the\r\ncountry was only lately cleared and brought into cultivation, the\r\npeople employed the skins of animals as clothes. But these skins were\r\nno longer sufficient for the multitude of the inhabitants; necessity\r\nmade them industrious; they applied themselves to the manufacture of\r\ncloth wherewith to cover themselves. But it was to this princess that\r\nthey owed the useful invention of silk stuffs. Afterwards, the\r\nempress, named by Chinese authors, according to the order of their\r\ndynasties, found an agreeable occupation in superintending the\r\nhatching, rearing, and feeding of silkworms, in making silk, and\r\nworking it up when made. There was an enclosure attached to the palace\r\nfor the cultivation of mulberry trees.\r\n\r\n\"The empress, accompanied by queens and the greatest ladies of the\r\ncourt, went in state into this inclosure, and gathered with her own\r\nhand the leaves of three branches which her ladies in waiting had\r\nlowered till they were within her reach; the finest pieces of silk\r\nwhich she made herself, or which were made by her orders and under her\r\nown eye, were destined for the ceremony of the grand sacrifice offered\r\nto Chang-si. (PLATE V.)\r\n\r\n\"It is probable,\" adds Duhalde, \"that policy had more to do than\r\nanything else with all this trouble taken by the empresses. Their\r\nintention was to induce, by their example, the princesses and ladies\r\nof quality, and the whole people, to rear silkworms: in the same way\r\nas the emperors, to ennoble in some sort agriculture, and to encourage\r\nthe people to undertake laborious works, never failed, at the\r\nbeginning of each spring, to guide the plough in person, and with\r\ngreat state to plough up a few furrows, and in these sow some seed.\r\n\r\n\"As far as concerns the empresses, it is a long time since they have\r\nceased to apply themselves to the manufacture of silk; one sees,\r\nnevertheless, in the precincts of the imperial palace, a large space\r\ncovered with houses, the road leading to which is still called the\r\nroad which leads to the place destined for the rearing of silkworms,\r\nfor the amusement of the empresses and queens. In the books of the\r\nphilosopher Mencius, is a wise police rule, made under the first\r\nreigns, which determines the space destined for the cultivation of\r\nmulberry trees, according to the extent of the land possessed by each\r\nprivate individual.\"\r\n\r\nM. Stanislas Julien[51] tells us of many regulations made by the\r\nEmperor of China, to render obligatory the care and attention\r\nrequisite to rearing silk.\r\n\r\n    [51] \"Résumé des principaux Traités Chinois sur la Culture des\r\n    Mûriers et l'Education des Vers à Soie, traduit par Stanislas\r\n    Julien.\" Paris, imprimerie royale, 1837.\r\n\r\nTchin-iu, being governor of the district of Kien-Si, ordered that\r\nevery man should plant fifty feet of land with mulberry trees.[52] The\r\nEmperor (under the dynasty of Witei) gave to each man twenty acres\r\nof land on condition that he planted fifty feet with mulberry\r\ntrees.[53] Hien-tsang (who ascended the throne in 806) ordered that\r\nthe inhabitants of the country should plant two feet in every acre\r\nwith mulberry trees.[54] The first Emperor of the dynasty of Song (who\r\nbegan to reign about the year 960) published a decree forbidding his\r\nsubjects to cut down the mulberry trees.[55]\r\n\r\n    [52] \"Annales de la Dynastie des Liang.\"\r\n\r\n    [53] \"Annales de la Dynastie des Wei.\"\r\n\r\n    [54] \"Annales de la Dynastie des Thang.\"\r\n\r\n    [55] \"Histoire de la Dynastie des Song.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V. The Empress Si-ling-chi gathering Mulberry Leaves.]\r\n\r\nBy all these means, according to the testimony of M. Stanislas Julien,\r\nthe business of the fabrication of silk became general in China. This\r\ngreat empire soon furnished its neighbours with this precious textile\r\nmaterial, and created for its own profit a very important branch of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nIt was forbidden, under pain of death, to export from China the\r\nsilkworm's eggs, or to furnish the necessary information in the art of\r\nobtaining the textile material. The manufactured article only could be\r\nsold out of the empire. It was thus that the Asiatic nations very soon\r\nunderstood silk; and that in many of their cities they applied\r\nthemselves to weaving stuffs of this precious substance. The carpets\r\nand dyed stuffs of Babylon, mixed with gold and silk, enjoyed in\r\nancient times an unparalleled renown. China was not, however, the only\r\ncountry that then furnished silk to the towns of Asia Minor. At a very\r\ndistant period India sent by her caravans very considerable quantities\r\nof it. M. Émile Blanchard (of the Institute) remarks, however, that\r\nthe tissues of India must be made of a different silk from that of\r\nChina, that is to say, of a silk of some of those _Bombyces_ of which\r\nthe public has been told so much of late years, and of which we shall\r\nhave soon to speak.\r\n\r\nSilk commanded for centuries a prodigiously high price. In the time of\r\nAlexander its value in Greece was exactly its own weight in gold, and\r\nso it was very parsimoniously employed in silk tissues. These were so\r\ntransparent that women who wore them were scarcely covered.\r\n\r\nSilk was unknown to the Romans before Julius Cæsar. It was to him that\r\nRome owed its acquaintance with this new material. He introduced it,\r\nmoreover, in a singularly magnificent manner. One day, at a _fête_\r\ngiven in the Colosseum--a combat of animals and gladiators--the people\r\nsaw the coarse tent of cloth, intended to keep off the rays of the\r\nsun, replaced by a magnificent covering of Oriental silk. They\r\nmurmured at this gorgeous prodigality, but declared Cæsar a great\r\nman. The introduction of silk among the Romans was the signal for\r\nluxurious expenditure. The patricians made a great display with their\r\nsilk cloaks of incalculable value; so that, from the time of Tiberius,\r\nthe Senate felt itself called upon to forbid the use of silk garments\r\nto men. Examples of simplicity are sometimes set in high places; thus,\r\nthe Emperor Aurelian refused to the Empress Severina so costly a\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nThe commerce in silk bore doubly hard upon Europe, both on account of\r\nthe value of the material and of the great use which was made of it.\r\nPersia was the emporium, and had the monopoly of this merchandise. The\r\nEmperor Justinian I., who reigned at Constantinople from A.D. 527 to\r\n565, tried all the means within his power of freeing his States from\r\nthis ruinous tyranny, when a circumstance occurred, very fortunately\r\nfor the national commerce, which brought about the introduction into\r\nEurope of sericulture, or the cultivation of silk.\r\n\r\nTwo monks of the order of St. Basil, in their ardour for the\r\npropagation of the faith, had pushed forwards into China. There they\r\nhad been initiated into the operations which furnished the fabric so\r\nhighly prized. On their return to Constantinople, and hearing of the\r\nproject that Justinian entertained of depriving the Persians of the\r\nmonopoly in silk, the two monks proposed to the Emperor to enrich his\r\nstate by introducing the art of fabricating this material. The\r\nproposition was greedily accepted, and the two monks returned again to\r\nChina, with the object of procuring the eggs of the insect. Having\r\narrived at the end of their journey, they succeeded in getting\r\npossession of a quantity of silkworms' eggs. They hid them between the\r\nknots of their sticks, and started back to their native country,\r\nwithout being once interfered with. Two years afterwards they\r\nre-entered Constantinople with their precious booty.[56] The larva\r\nwere fed on mulberry leaves. Immediately afterwards began the rearing\r\nof the worms and the preparation of the silk, according to the\r\ninstructions given by these courageous travellers. The first broods\r\nsucceeded perfectly, and so plantations of mulberry trees were seen to\r\nmultiply and spread through the whole extent of the Eastern Empire. It\r\nwas, above all, in Southern Greece that this branch of industry\r\nassumed an immense importance. It was then the Peloponnesus lost its\r\nold name, and was called the Morea, from the Latin name for\r\n\"mulberry,\" _morus_.[57]\r\n\r\n    [56] According to M. de Gasparin, author of an excellent \"Essai\r\n    sur l'Histoire de l'Introduction des Vers à Soie en Europe\"\r\n    (Paris, in 8vo, 1841), it was not into China, but only into\r\n    Tartary, to Serinda, that the two monks went in search of the\r\n    silkworms' eggs (pp. 37-39). It must be supposed that the eggs\r\n    did not hatch for two years, being in such interesting company.\r\n\r\n    [57] Others derive the name from _more_, the Slavonic word for\r\n    the sea. See \"On the Study of Words,\" by Abp. Trench.--ED.\r\n\r\nConstantinople and Greece, during centuries, furnished the whole of\r\nEurope with silkworms. This diffusion, however, was effected very\r\nslowly. The Greeks attached great importance to retaining the\r\nmonopoly, and the emperor Justinian had caused to be established at\r\nConstantinople itself silk manufactories, where the most skilful\r\nartificers of Asia, who were forbidden to reveal the various processes\r\nto strangers, worked.\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of the eighth century the Arabs introduced the\r\nsilkworm into Spain. But this industry remained confined within narrow\r\nlimits. It was in fact not till after the twelfth century that\r\nsericulture began to spread throughout Europe. Roger, King of the Two\r\nSicilies, possessing a navy that commanded the Mediterranean, employed\r\nit chiefly in making excursions and conquests. He ravaged Greece, and,\r\nnot satisfied with the booty he carried away from that unfortunate\r\ncountry, wished still further to deprive them, for the good of his own\r\nkingdom, of the silk monopoly, the source of their riches. Roger\r\ncarried away into Sicily and Naples a great number of prisoners,\r\namongst whom were some weavers and men who had devoted themselves to\r\nthe rearing of silkworms. In 1169 he established these workmen in\r\nhouses adjoining his own palace at Palermo. There they dyed the silk\r\nof different colours, and mixed it with gold, pearls, and precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nFrom Sicily the art of preparing silk spread over the rest of Italy.\r\nIn 1204 the workers in silk constituted themselves into a syndicate at\r\nFlorence. It is not, however, till 1423--more than two hundred years\r\nafter the introduction of this branch of industry into Italy--that we\r\nfind the first mention of the cultivation of the mulberry tree in\r\nTuscany. In 1440 each Tuscan peasant was forced to plant at least five\r\nmulberry trees on the land he cultivated. In 1474 the commerce in silk\r\nfabrics with all parts of the world had become extremely prosperous at\r\nFlorence. In 1314 the Venetian manufactures began to assume much\r\nimportance. Three thousand workers in silk were then established in\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling longer on the propagation of the silk trade in Italy,\r\nlet us pass on to its establishment in France. It was in 1340 that\r\nsome French gentlemen, who had stayed some time in Naples, planted in\r\nAvignon the first mulberry trees.[58] According to Olivier de Serres,\r\nit was not introduced till much later into Dauphiné. It was not\r\nintroduced into Alan, near Montelimart, till 1495, by the Seigneur\r\nGuyape de Saint-Aubain.[59] Louis XI. made great efforts to develop\r\nthe silk trade in France, by inviting over Italian workmen; and they\r\nbegan under his reign to fabricate silks in Touraine and Lyons.\r\nFrancis I. greatly developed the trade of Lyons. In 1554, under Henry\r\nII., the masters and men employed in the manufacture of gold, silver,\r\nand silk in Lyons were twelve thousand in number. Under Henry II. were\r\nplanted the mulberry trees of Bourdezière, Tours, Chenonceaux,\r\nToulouse, and Moulins. These plantations, however, were of very small\r\nextent. They were not the result of a general and truly popular\r\neffort; moreover, civil war came very soon, and turned men's minds\r\naway from the isolated attempts of some few private individuals.\r\nSericulture, in fact, did not assume any great importance in France\r\ntill the reign of Henry IV.\r\n\r\n    [58] De Gasparin, \"Essai sur l'Introduction des Vers à Soie en\r\n    Europe,\" p. 70.\r\n\r\n    [59] \"Théâtre d'Agriculture d'Olivier de Serres,\" tome ii., p.\r\n    158. In 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis king saw with grief considerable sums of money leaving France\r\neach year for the purchase of raw silk or of silk stuffs. Two men\r\nmarvellously furthered his project of encouraging the silk trade. One\r\nof these men was Barthelemy Laffemas, called _Beausemblant_. For a\r\nlong time he had been writing memoir upon memoir, to demonstrate the\r\nadvantages to be derived from the plantation of the mulberry tree in\r\nFrance; and he tells us that silkworms were then raised with success\r\nat Nantes, at Poissy, and even at Paris. The second supporter whom\r\nHenry IV. found in the propagation of sericulture was a man\r\ndistinguished in a very different way from that of M. Laffemas. This\r\nwas Olivier de Serres, the author of the \"Théâtre de l'Agriculture;\"\r\nhe whom Henry IV. called his _lord and master in agriculture_. Olivier\r\nde Serres was the first among his countrymen who had published\r\ninstructions regarding the cultivation of mulberry trees and the\r\nrearing of silkworms. Henry IV., who had noticed his writings, called\r\nhim to Paris; and, on his solicitation, caused twenty thousand\r\nmulberry trees and a great quantity of silkworms' eggs, of which a\r\ndistribution was made over the whole of France, to be imported from\r\nItaly. From that moment, sericulture was propagated rapidly in the\r\nCévennes, in Provence, in Languedoc, in Touraine, and many other\r\nprovinces. Mulberry trees were planted at Fontainebleau, in the royal\r\npark of Tournelles, and even in the Tuileries, where an Italian lady,\r\nnamed Julle, reared silkworms for Henry IV.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this great impulse, sericulture dwindled away on the\r\ndeath of that king. It received a fresh impulse under Colbert, the\r\ngreat minister, who succeeded in creating the spirit of commerce and\r\ntrade in France. New manufactories were established, and plantations\r\nof mulberry trees formed in many of the provinces. All this progress\r\nwas suddenly brought to a standstill by the iniquitous revocation of\r\nthe Edict of Nantes, which deprived France of her leading commercial\r\nmen. Driven from their own country, the Protestant families of the\r\nCévennes established abroad silk manufactories, the fabrics of which\r\nrivalled those of French production.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the intendants of the provinces tried, but\r\nwith very slight success, to give a fresh impetus to sericulture in\r\nFrance. The Abbé Boissier de Sauvages published, about 1760, some\r\nworks, which prove him to have been a patient observer, an accurate\r\nreasoner, and a clever rearer of silkworms. Boissier de Sauvages is\r\nthe father of modern silk-culture. During the first Revolution, men's\r\nminds were occupied with graver subjects than the cultivation of the\r\nmulberry tree. But, on the return of peace, they got to work again on\r\nall sides. In 1808, the minister Chaptal estimated the weight of the\r\ncocoon harvest at between five or six thousand kilogrammes; whilst the\r\ninvention of the Jacquard loom gave an immense impulse to the weaving\r\nof silk stuffs. Amongst those who introduced and benefited the art of\r\nsericulture, we must not forget Dandolo. Dandolo, who was born at\r\nVenice in 1758, and died in 1819, was the first who, at the beginning\r\nof this century, applied himself seriously to the amelioration of the\r\nprocesses employed in the cultivation of silk. He endeavoured to\r\nregulate the temperature, to introduce more order into the\r\ndistribution of the food to the worms, to have more spacious premises,\r\nand to have these properly ventilated.\r\n\r\nNow we are on this subject, we must mention the names of those who at\r\nthe present day have rendered important services to sericulture--such\r\nas M. Camille Beauvais, who raised silkworm rearing from the\r\ninactivity into which it had been plunged; M. Eugène Robert, who\r\nfounded in the south of France the first successful silkworm nursery;\r\nM. Guérin-Méneville, who has devoted his life to the study of the same\r\nquestion, and to whom Europe owes the introduction and the\r\nacclimatisation of some species which will render us, perhaps, one day\r\nvery great services; and lastly, M. Robinet, who has elucidated\r\nseveral practical questions in the art of sericulture. In bringing to\r\na close this rapid historical epitome, we will state that France\r\nconsumes annually 30,000 kilogrammes of silkworms' eggs, each\r\nkilogramme being at the present time worth from 300 to 500 francs,\r\nand even more. The value of manufactured silks represents annually\r\nabout 8,000,000 francs; and we find by official statistics that France\r\nexported in 1863 silk stuffs to the value of 384,000,000 francs. This\r\nimmense trade shows how much silk is now-a-days everywhere\r\nappreciated; in those numerous tissues called taffeta, satin, and\r\nvelvet, each of which seems to have a charm--a peculiar attraction.\r\nThe consistency of the stuff, the smoothness, the softness of surface,\r\nthe manner in which silk receives colours, the brightness, fineness,\r\npower of reflecting, the rustling, the light or heavy folds,--all\r\nthese are beauty, elegance, and luxury, in whatever way these words\r\nare understood.\r\n\r\nThe _Bombyx mori_ has, however, nothing alluring in its appearance.\r\nOther caterpillars of the genus _Bombyx_ have brilliant liveries; they\r\nare adorned with spots, blue as sapphires, green as emeralds, red as\r\nrubies, but produce threads without brightness and fineness. The\r\nhumble silkworm, in a white blouse, like a workman, has nothing\r\nbrilliant in its dress, and yet it gives to the whole world its most\r\nbeautiful and gorgeous array. The body of the silkworm is composed of\r\nthirteen distinct segments. In front are three pairs of articulated\r\nlegs, which will become later those of the moth. In the middle and\r\ntowards the posterior part, are five pairs of membranous legs,\r\nfurnished with a circle of very fine bristles, which assist the animal\r\nto hook itself on to leaves and stalks. On the two sides of its body\r\nare eighteen stigmata, or respiratory mouths.\r\n\r\nThe head of the silkworm is remarkable; it is scaly, horny, and formed\r\nof one single piece. The mouth is provided with six small articulated\r\npieces. Below is a simple blade, the upper lip, having in its middle a\r\nhollow, into which the animal causes the edge of the leaf it is\r\ngnawing to enter, and holds it thus without any exertion. Underneath\r\nthe lip are inserted two large jaws, which cut the leaf as a pair of\r\nscissors. Underneath, some weaker jaws divide the fragments, and a\r\nlittle organ, articulated on to each jaw, that is to say, a palpus,\r\npushes them back towards the mouth, and prevents the smallest particle\r\nof the leaf from falling. And lastly, in the space comprised between\r\nthe two jaws, is an under-lip, which completely closes the mouth\r\nbelow. At the extremity of this piece may be seen a little\r\nprolongation, a sort of papilla, pierced with a hole, which is the\r\norifice that gives issue to the silky thread.\r\n\r\nThe organs which serve for the elaboration and emission of the silk\r\nhave a peculiar interest for us. If we dissect a silkworm under water,\r\nwe succeed, sooner or later, after having removed the outer parts, in\r\nlaying bare a double apparatus, placed along the two sides of the\r\nintestinal canal and below it. This is the apparatus which secretes\r\nthe silk; it is the double silk-bearing gland. Each one of these\r\nglands is composed of a tube formed of three distinct parts (Fig.\r\n201). The part which is nearest to the tail of the worm is a bent\r\ntube, A B C, of a thirtieth of an inch in diameter, and about nine\r\ninches in length, twisted a great many times into irregular zig-zags.\r\nThis part of the silk-producing organ is continued in an enlarged\r\nportion, D E, which is the reservoir of the silky matter. To the\r\nextremity, E, of this reservoir, is attached another capillary tube, E\r\nF. These two capillary tubes, proceeding from the two glands, unite\r\ntogether like two venous trunks, as the plate shows, in one single,\r\nshort canal, F, which opens in the mouth of the worm, at its\r\nunder-lip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.--Silk secreting apparatus.]\r\n\r\nIt is in the narrow hinder tubes that the silky matter is formed. It\r\ncollects in the swollen part, D E, which is, properly speaking, the\r\nreservoir; and remains there in the glutinous state. Having reached\r\nthe capillary tubes, it begins to assume consistency, and forms two\r\nthreads, which are united together at the point of junction of the\r\ntubes, and come out through the orifice, with the appearance of a\r\nsingle thread, to be conducted and directed by the animal to those\r\npoints it has selected.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that by taking from the body of the worm the viscous\r\nmatter contained in the glands, silk could be formed. But this hope\r\nwas disappointed. It was found possible, it is true, to take the silk\r\nout; to draw it out into threads more or less fine; but up to this\r\ntime it has only been possible in this way to obtain a matter which,\r\nwhen dried, more or less resembles catgut, and is easily enough spoilt\r\nby water.\r\n\r\nThe viscous substance contained in the glands must then be elaborated\r\nby the insect itself. When it arrives in the conduit common to the\r\ncapillary tubes, under the form of a thread, it is impregnated with a\r\nsort of varnish, which is poured into them from two neighbouring\r\nglands. The varnish unites the two threads into one single thread, and\r\nimparts to it the brilliancy of silk, and the property of resisting\r\nthe action of water. It is during the last phases of the worm's\r\ndevelopment that the silky matter becomes abundant in the glands. At\r\nthis period the animal eats much; and it is certain that the substance\r\nto be converted is furnished by the leaf of the tree on which the\r\ninsect feeds.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this having been remarked, some manufacturers have\r\nattempted to obtain their silk directly from the mulberry leaf; but\r\nthey only get a bad floss or refuse silk. This is because the silk is\r\nnot formed in the mulberry leaf. The organs of insects are\r\nlaboratories, in which manipulations unknown to man are carried on,\r\nmanipulations which he has not been able to imitate.\r\n\r\nAfter this rapid glance at the fundamental parts of the organism of\r\nthe silkworm, we will occupy ourselves with the natural history,\r\nproperly so called, of this insect, and with its rearing, carried on\r\nwith a view to the production of silk.\r\n\r\nAs belonging to the first part of this programme, we have to speak of\r\nthe _moult_, of the _ages_ of the silkworm, of its maturity, of its\r\n_mounting_ or _ascending season_, of the formation of the cocoon, of\r\nthe chrysalis, of the moth, and the eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.--Head of the Silkworm during moulting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.--Position of Silkworm while moulting.]\r\n\r\nThe name moult has been given to a sort of crisis during which the\r\nrenewing of the skin of larvæ takes place. When it approaches, the\r\nsilkworm changes its colour. Its robe, which was white or grey, and\r\nopaque, becomes yellow and somewhat transparent. The head swells\r\nconsiderably, especially above, and the skin becomes wrinkled (Fig.\r\n202). The worm then fasts, and prepares to cast its skin. It places\r\nhere and there some silk threads on the surrounding objects. It then\r\nslips under these threads, so that during its movements the old skin\r\nwhich it will abandon is, so to speak, gathered up. It then assumes a\r\npeculiar position, that represented in Fig. 203, and remains in it in\r\na state of immobility which has been called sleep (_sommeil_).\r\n\r\nDuring this sleep the new skin is formed under the old. A liquid oozes\r\nforth between the two membranes which separates them, and allows the\r\nsilkworm to leave its old skin. To effect this, the worm begins by\r\nraising its head, and by making contortions. The old skin splits round\r\nthe muzzle, or snout, on the head and back; then by different\r\nmovements the animal emerges from its skin, which remains held up by\r\nthe silken threads. The duration of the time occupied in moulting\r\nvaries with the degree of the heat or humidity of the atmosphere; but\r\nin general the state of _sleep_ lasts from twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours. One hour after the crisis the worm begins again to eat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.--Egg and first age.]\r\n\r\nThe _ages_ of the silkworm are the periods of time which elapse\r\nbetween one moult and another. If we observe some silkworms when the\r\ntemperature is favourable, we shall find that there are four moults,\r\nand consequently five ages. At the first age (Fig. 204), the silkworm\r\nis black and hairy; then of a nut colour at the moment when the first\r\nmoult is going to take place. \"The appearance presented by these worms\r\ncollected together on a leaf,\" says Dandolo, \"is that of a downy\r\nsurface of a dark chestnut colour, in the midst of which one sees\r\nnothing but a movement of little animals having their heads raised,\r\nworking them about, and presenting black, shiny muzzles. Their bodies\r\nare completely covered with hairs arranged in straight lines, between\r\nwhich one perceives along the whole length of the body other longer\r\nhairs.\"[60]\r\n\r\n    [60] \"L'Art d'élever les Vers à Soie,\" par le Comte Dandolo.\r\n    In 8vo. 2e édition. Lyon, 1825.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.--Second age.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.--Third age.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.--Fourth age.]\r\n\r\nThe first age lasts for five days. At the second (Fig. 205), the worm\r\nis grey, almost without down, then of a yellowish white, and one sees\r\nthe crescents making their appearance on the second and fifth segment.\r\nAt the third age (Fig. 206), there is not a single hair remaining, and\r\nthe worm becomes whitish, and is always becoming lighter. The third\r\nage lasts six days, as does also the fourth (Fig. 207). At the fifth\r\n(Fig. 208), the worm has very nearly reached the end of its career in\r\nthe caterpillar state, and now is the time of its greatest voracity.\r\nThis age is the longest; it lasts nine days.\r\n\r\nAt each of these periods in the life of the silkworm may be remarked\r\na physiological fact to which has been given the name of _frèze_. When\r\nthe silkworm has just moulted it eats little, but the time very soon\r\narrives when it does so with extraordinary avidity. It is indeed\r\ninsatiable. The _frèze_ of the last age is called the _grande frèze_.\r\nIt takes place about the seventh day. During this day worms, the\r\nproduce of thirty grammes[61] of eggs, consume in weight as much as\r\nfour horses, and the noise which their little jaws make resembles that\r\nof a very heavy shower of rain. It is at the end of this stage that\r\nthe insect prepares the shelter in which is to be brought about its\r\nmetamorphosis into a chrysalis.\r\n\r\n    [61] One gramme = 15·4325 gr. troy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.--Fifth age.]\r\n\r\nA little while before this it ceases to eat, turns yellow, and becomes\r\nas transparent as a grape. It is now said to have reached its\r\n_maturity_. Up to this moment the worm had never tried to leave its\r\nlitter. It lived a sedentary life, and never thought of wandering away\r\nfrom its food. Now it is seized with an imperious desire for changing\r\nits quarters. It gets up, it roams about, and moves its head in all\r\ndirections to find some place to cling on to. It walks over everything\r\nwithin its reach, particularly over those obstacles which are placed\r\nvertically. It aspires, not to descend, like the heroes of classic\r\ntragedy, but to rise. It is for this reason that this period of the\r\nsilkworm's life has received the name of the _mounting_ or _ascending\r\nseason_. It now looks for a convenient place in which to establish its\r\ncocoon. Every one has remarked how the animal sets to work to\r\naccomplish its task. It begins by throwing from different sides\r\nthreads destined for fixing the cocoon; this is what we call _refuse\r\nsilk_. The proper space having been circumscribed by this means, the\r\nworm begins to unwind its thread--a continuous thread of about a\r\nthousand mètres long.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated, let us say by the way, that forty thousand\r\ncocoons would suffice to surround the earth at the equator with one\r\nthread of silk. Folded on itself almost like a horse-shoe, its back\r\nwithin, its legs without, the worm arranges its thread all round its\r\nbody, describing ovals with its head. It approximates gradually the\r\npoints of attachment of the thread. As long as the cocoon is not very\r\nthick one can watch it through the meshes of the web applying and\r\nfixing its thread, still to a certain degree soft, in such a manner as\r\nto make it adhere closely to the parts already formed.\r\n\r\n\"We can state,\" says M. Robinet, \"that the silkworm makes every second\r\na movement extending over about five millimètres. The length of the\r\nthreads being known, it follows that the worm moves its head three\r\nhundred thousand times in making its cocoon. If it employs seventy-two\r\nhours at its work, it is a hundred thousand movements every\r\ntwenty-four hours, four thousand one hundred and sixty-six an hour,\r\nand sixty-nine a minute, that is to say, a little more than one a\r\nsecond.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the fourth day, after having expended all its silk,[62] the worm\r\nshut up in the cocoon becomes of a waxy white colour, and swollen in\r\nthe middle of its body. The abdominal legs wither away; the six fore\r\nlegs approach each other and become black. The parts of the mouth tend\r\ndownwards; the skin wrinkles. Very soon it is detached and pushed down\r\ntowards the hinder part, and the chrysalis appears under the rents in\r\nthe skin. It is at first white, but speedily becomes of a brown red.\r\n\r\n    [62] \"Manuel de l'Educateur du Ver à Soie,\" p. 37.\r\n\r\nThe silkworm remains in general from fifteen to seventeen days in the\r\npupa state. At the moment of hatching, the moth begins by breaking the\r\nskin in which it is shut up, and which is pretty thin. But how can it\r\ncome out of the silky prison which it has itself built? To effect this\r\nit makes use of a peculiar liquid contained in a little bladder with\r\nwhich its head is provided, and which was discovered by M.\r\nGuérin-Méneville. It moistens the cocoon with this liquid; which soaks\r\nthrough and penetrates the whole thickness of the silken wall which\r\nconfines it. The threads of silk of which it is composed are moistened\r\nand disunited, but not broken. The moth opens a passage for itself\r\nthrough the threads thus separated, and makes its appearance in the\r\nlight of day. Its wings are folded back on themselves, and it is still\r\nquite wet, but it seeks immediately for a good place in which to dry\r\nitself, and in a little time assumes its final appearance (Figs. 209,\r\n210). The female (Fig. 210) has whitish wings, the antennæ only\r\nslightly developed and pale, the abdomen voluminous, cylindrical, and\r\nwell filled. It is quiet, heavy, and stationary. The male is smaller;\r\nits wings are tinged with grey, its antennæ blackish; it moves about,\r\nbeats its wings together, and is lively and petulant.\r\n\r\nBefore laying her eggs, the female looks out for a place suitable for\r\nthis purpose. When she has found this place, she ejects an egg covered\r\nwith a viscous liquid, which causes it to adhere to the body upon\r\nwhich it falls. Very soon she lays a second egg by the side of the\r\nfirst, then a third by the side of the second, and so on. She very\r\nrarely piles them up on each other. The laying lasts about three days;\r\nthe number of eggs is from 300 to 700 for each female. These eggs are\r\ngenerally tentacular and flattened towards the centre. At the moment\r\nat which they are laid they are of a bright yellow. In a week they\r\nbecome brown. The colour changes then to a reddish grey; lastly it\r\nbecomes of a slaty grey, remaining this colour during the autumn,\r\nwinter, and a great part of the spring. Then as the temperature rises,\r\nthe colour of the eggs passes successively through bluish, violet,\r\nashy, and yellowish shades. And, lastly, they become more and more\r\nwhitish every day as the hatching time approaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.--Silkworm Moth (_Bombyx mori_), male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.--Silkworm Moth (_Bombyx mori_), female.]\r\n\r\nIf looked at closely, one remarks a black spot and a brownish crescent\r\nextending along the circumference. The black spot is the head of the\r\nworm, which closely touches the shell; the crescent is the body, which\r\nis already covered with little hairs. When it leaves the egg, the\r\nsilkworm gnaws through the shell on its side, never on its flat\r\nsurface. When the opening is large enough, it breaks out through it,\r\nhead foremost, and immediately fixes a thread of silk to any object it\r\ncan reach, no doubt in order to prevent itself from falling. Sometimes\r\nthe opening is too small to allow of the head passing out, and\r\nthe larva is forced to come out backwards, that is to say, tail\r\nforemost. At times, not being able to get its head free, the poor\r\nanimal very soon dies of fatigue and hunger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI. A Silkworm rearing Establishment.]\r\n\r\nWe will now give a summary of the rearing of the silkworm, that is\r\nto say, of the attention which must be paid to this insect that it\r\nmay construct its cocoon advantageously. We will call to our aid\r\nin this very rapid summary the works or notices of MM. Robinet,\r\nGuérin-Méneville, Eugène Robert, and Louis Leclerc, and we must not\r\nforget the excellent and classical Dandolo.[63]\r\n\r\n    [63] \"L'Art d'élever des Vers à Soie, par le Comte de Dandolo,\r\n    traduit par Philibert Fontaneilles.\" In 8vo.

Paris.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to rear silkworms--_magnans_, as they were called\r\nin old French, and as they are still called in the patois of\r\nLanguedoc--the first thing to do is to obtain good eggs, good _grain_,\r\nto use the technical word, and then to choose suitable premises. The\r\nessential, the fundamental point, in the rearing, is to possess\r\npremises in which the air is easily renewed. The worms should have as\r\nmuch air as possible given to them without ever being allowed to be\r\nchilled. There is no better means of attaining this end than by\r\nkeeping a constant open fire in a room, and by letting air into the\r\nroom from another chamber which separates it from the open air. One\r\nhas, in this way, the best workroom for a small rearing.\r\n\r\nIn the workshop are arranged racks, by the aid of which are placed, at\r\nthe distance of 50 centimètres from each other, frames made of reeds.\r\nThese frames, or _canisses_, as they are called in the Cévennes, may\r\nbe from 1 mètre to 1-3/4 mètres in breadth. They should be placed in\r\nsuch a manner that one can easily pass round them to place and remove\r\nthe worms, and to distribute their leaves to them uniformly. They\r\nshould be protected by a small border of a few centimètres in height,\r\nto prevent the worms from falling. And lastly, they should be covered\r\nat the bottom with large sheets of paper. (PLATE VI.) A provident\r\nsilkworm-rearer has always at his disposal a cellar or cool room, so\r\nas to be able to stow away his leaves as soon as they are brought in\r\nfrom the country.\r\n\r\nWhat we have just said applies especially to a small rearing. In large\r\nestablishments, or even those of second-rate importance, everything is\r\nin advance of this, and mathematically regulated: aspect and\r\narrangement of rooms, furniture of these rooms, warming, ventilation,\r\n&c. So, for a rearing house for 300 grammes of eggs, the building\r\nshould be constructed in such a manner that its front and back look\r\neast and west, to avoid any inequality in the heat derived from the\r\nsun. It ought to consist of a ground-floor, a very lofty first-floor,\r\nand of a rather low roof. The ground-floor comprises the chamber of\r\nincubation, the store-room for leaves, and the air-chamber with the\r\ngrate intended for warmth and ventilation. The first-floor constitutes\r\nthe rearing-room properly so called.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave these grand industrial establishments, to return to\r\nour rearing houses on a small scale, such as are found among the\r\npeasants of the Cévennes. They generally receive the silkworms' eggs\r\nbefore the end of the winter. In order to preserve them till the\r\nhatching season, they are placed in thin layers, in a piece of folded\r\nwoollen stuff, which must be hung up in a cool, but not a damp place,\r\nexposed to the north. As soon as the buds of the mulberry tree begin\r\nto be partially open, they proceed to the incubation of the eggs. They\r\nare spread out on sheets of paper, in very thin layers, placed on a\r\ntable in a room having a southern aspect, and left thus during three\r\nor four days, taking care to prevent the rays of the sun from touching\r\nthem. It is necessary also, from time to time, to open the windows.\r\nAfter three or four days, the fire is lighted, taking care not to have\r\nmore heat than 13° Centigrade round about the table which supports the\r\neggs, and which should be placed as far as possible from the fire.\r\nEach day the room is warmed a little more, in such a way that the\r\ntemperature is raised 1° to 2° a day, until 25° Centigrade of heat\r\nhave been attained, at which temperature it is to be maintained when\r\nthe eggs have reached the last stage, and till the hatching is\r\nterminated. On the first day few worms are hatched; but the hatching\r\nof the second day is very abundant, as also that of the third. Of\r\nthese newly-born worms two divisions are made, separated by an\r\ninterval of twenty-four hours. The worms which are born afterwards are\r\nthrown away, unless they are so abundant that they can be made a third\r\nbatch of, which is to be mixed up with the second at the period of the\r\nmoult.\r\n\r\nIn the large rearing houses there is a special chamber for the\r\nincubation. Various simple, convenient, cheap apparatuses, whose main\r\nobject is to create a permanent warm and damp atmosphere, whose degree\r\nof heat can be regulated at will, have been proposed. M. Louis\r\nLeclerc, in his pamphlet entitled \"Petite Magnanerie,\" has given a\r\ndescription and drawing of a little box which is very useful for\r\nfacilitating the hatching of eggs. We refer those of our readers who\r\nwish for further information on the subject to that work. As soon as\r\nthe worms are hatched, the eggs are covered with net, and over this\r\nare placed mulberry boughs, covered with tender leaves, on which all\r\nthe little worms congregate. They are then lifted up with a hook made\r\nof thin wire, and the worms are placed on a table covered with paper,\r\nleaving a proper space between each. They are given, as their first\r\nmeal, tender leaves cut into little pieces with a knife. These are the\r\noperations gone through for the two raisings of worms on the second\r\nand third day of the hatching. During this first age they give them\r\nfrom six to eight meals a day, taking care to distribute their food to\r\nthem as equally as possible. The first meal is given at five o'clock\r\nin the morning; the last at eleven or twelve o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nWhen the moult is approaching, the young ones are made to climb on to\r\nboughs having tender leaves, so that they can be moved to litters as\r\nthin and clean as possible, and there sleep in a good state of health.\r\nWhen the mass of worms is well awake again, the next thing to do is to\r\ntake them off the litter on which they moulted, and to give them food.\r\nIf this problem were proposed to a person strange to the operation\r\nwhich is now occupying our attention--to separate the worms from the\r\nfaded and withered food upon which they are reposing, without touching\r\nthem--he would certainly be very much at a loss what to answer. The\r\nsolution of this problem presented for a long time great difficulties,\r\nand occasioned numerous reverses in the rearing. Now-a-days, thanks to\r\nthe employment of a net, the _délitement_, or taking them off their\r\nbed, has become an easy operation.\r\n\r\nOver the worms, placed on a table, is spread a net, the meshes of\r\nwhich are broad enough to allow them to pass through. On this net are\r\nspread the leaves which are to compose a meal. The worms immediately\r\nleave the old food, and get on to the new leaves. They then lift the\r\nlitter with the worms, and throw away the old leaves, now unoccupied,\r\nclean the table, and replace the net with the worms. At the next\r\n_délitement_ the first net is found under the litter. Figs. 211 and\r\n212 represent two forms of these nets made of thread.\r\n\r\nThread nets, which were of great use, have been supplanted lately,\r\nwith great advantage, by paper ones, which were invented by M. Eugène\r\nRobert. These are leaves of paper, of a peculiar manufacture, pierced\r\nwith holes proportioned to the size of the worms which are to pass\r\nthrough them. The paper net can be used advantageously also for\r\nseparating the worms that are too near together, or, as they say, for\r\nthe _dédoublement_. Formerly, the _délitement_ and the _dédoublement_\r\nwere done by hand--a tedious work, and one that presented serious\r\ndisadvantages. Now-a-days, as we have seen, the worms themselves\r\nperform these two perilous operations.\r\n\r\nAt the second age they still cut the leaves for the worms, but into\r\nlarger pieces, and proportioned to their size. During the day the\r\ntemperature of the room ought to be kept to 21° Centigrade, but it may\r\nbe lowered by 1° or 2° during the night. Towards the end of this age\r\nthey have only four meals. When the worms are on the point of going to\r\nsleep, their meals are decreased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.--Lozenge-shaped net.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212.--Square net.]\r\n\r\nDuring the third age the number of the meals is kept to four, the\r\nfirst being given towards five o'clock in the morning, and the last\r\nbetween ten and eleven o'clock at night. The leaf is cut into much\r\nlarger pieces, and distributed as equally as possible. The\r\n_délitement_ and the _dédoublement_ are proceeded with as in the\r\npreceding age. One begins to find pretty often during this period of\r\nthe life of worms, some _luisettes_--that is to say, worms which have\r\nnot strength enough to moult. They are larger than those just woke up,\r\nand that have not as yet eaten, and are shiny. They must be carefully\r\nremoved, for they will not be long before they die, and infect the air\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth age they no longer cut the leaves, but give them a\r\ngreat deal more at once. The result is that the litters increase in\r\nthickness, and that the _délitement_ must be performed oftener; for\r\nthe rest, four meals are always necessary. Many _luisettes_ may be\r\nseen during the fourth age. The moult which follows the fourth age is\r\nthe most critical phase in the life of the silkworm. During their\r\nsleep they are a prey to acute suffering, and are plunged into a\r\nstate of lethargy which resembles death. The dryest and cleanest\r\nlitters diffuse very soon a sickly smell. This moult lasts from\r\nthirty-six to forty-eight hours. During this time the room should be\r\nkept to at least 22° Centigrade.\r\n\r\nWhen they awake out of this last sleep the attendant should\r\ncontinually be on his guard, as it is then that diseases break out.\r\nThe worms suffering from these different diseases have received\r\ndifferent names. There are besides the _luisettes_ the _arpians_--that\r\nis to say, worms that have exhausted all their energy in the work of\r\nthe last moult, and have not even strength to eat--the _yellow_, or\r\n_fat_ worms, which are swollen, of a yellowish colour, and which very\r\neasily die; the _flats_ or _mous_, the soft or indolent ones which,\r\nafter having eaten a great deal and become very fat, die miserably,\r\nand enter into a state of putrefaction. And lastly, it is at this age\r\nthat the _muscardine_, which hardly shows itself at any other age of\r\nthe insect, appears with great intensity.\r\n\r\nThe _muscardine_ is a terrible scourge to the rearers of silkworms.\r\nThe losses which result from this disease in France are estimated at\r\nat least one-sixth of the profits. No particular symptom allows of our\r\nrecognising the existence of this disease in worms which, however,\r\ncontain its germ; only, the worm, which has eaten up to that time as\r\nusual, appears almost in a moment to change to a duller white; its\r\nmovements become slower, it becomes soft, and is not long before it\r\ndies. Seven or eight days after its death it becomes reddish and\r\ncompletely rigid. Twenty four hours afterwards a white efflorescence\r\nshows itself round the head and rings, and soon after the whole body\r\nbecomes floury. This flour is a fungus called _Botrytis bassiana_, of\r\nwhich the _mycelium_ develops itself in the fatty tissue of the\r\ncaterpillar, attacks the intestines, and fructifies on the exterior.\r\nThis fungus has been considered as the immediate cause of the\r\n_muscardine_, and has been also regarded as the last symptom or end of\r\nthe disease. The communication of the disease by contagion has\r\nalternately been admitted and denied. As its true cause, and any\r\nefficacious means of opposing it, are still unknown, the breeders of\r\nsilkworms must be content to apply--so as to prevent or struggle\r\nagainst this dreadful scourge--the precepts of hygiene: good\r\nventilation, excessive cleanliness, frequent _délitements_, and good\r\nfood properly prepared.\r\n\r\nAfter the _muscardine_, we must mention another epidemic disease still\r\nmore terrible, the _gattine_. This disease shows itself from the very\r\nbeginning of the rearing, and increases in intensity at each age, so\r\nthat the number of worms able to enter regularly into the moult\r\nbecomes smaller and smaller. We are still in a state of utter\r\nignorance as to the cause of this last affection, which has\r\noccasioned, for the last ten years, incalculable losses in the rearing\r\nhouses, which threatens the silkworm with complete destruction, and\r\nwhich in the meanwhile has ruined the unfortunate countries of the\r\nCévennes, the principal seat of sericulture in France.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifth age, the worms become large so quickly that on the\r\nfifth or sixth day they are obliged to be moved away from each other\r\non the litter. The _délitement_ must be made every two days, or\r\nindeed, every day now, on account of the enormous amount of the\r\nexcrement; and, at the same time, a good ventilation must be\r\nconstantly maintained. The temperature of the room should now be kept\r\nto 24°, without ever exceeding this degree of heat. When it is\r\nperceived that the worms wish to ascend, or _mount_, there are placed\r\non the tables, at certain distances from each other, little sprigs of\r\nheather or very dry branches of light wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.--Sprigs of heather arranged so that Silkworms\r\nmay mount into them.]\r\n\r\nWhen the worms begin to mount into the heather, one must\r\n_encabaner_--that is to say, form with these branches little hedges,\r\ncurved back like a hut or cradle, the openings of which are, on an\r\naverage, seventeen inches or so (Fig. 213). At the expiration of\r\ntwenty-four hours all the good worms have mounted. The laggards who\r\nremain under the _cabanes_ are taken off by hand, and placed on a\r\ntable, which is immediately _encabanea_.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons spun on these branches of heather ought to be large,\r\nheavy, and well-shaped. The good cocoons are regular; their ends are\r\nrounded and not pierced; and they are hard, especially at their\r\nextremities, and have a fine grain. They are cylindrical. The best are\r\ndrawn in towards the middle, or have a concavity on either side of it\r\n(Fig. 215). Every one knows that there are white and yellow cocoons.\r\nThey are the produce of different races of worms.\r\n\r\nCommerce recognises two kinds of white silk: the _first white_ and the\r\n_second white_. The silk of the _first white_ is produced by the race\r\n_Sina_, the cocoons of which are of a perfect and azured white. They\r\nproduce the most beautiful and most precious silk, and serve for the\r\nfabrication of light and delicate coloured tissues. The silk of the\r\n_second white_ is furnished by two races: the _Espagnolet_ and the\r\n_Roquemaure_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.--Spherical cocoon of the Bombyx mori.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.--Cocoon of Bombyx mori, drawn in towards the\r\nmiddle.]\r\n\r\nThe races that produce yellow cocoons are more numerous than the white\r\nones. The yellow races are divided into three groups: those that have\r\nsmall, middle-sized, or large cocoons. The first and second are\r\nstronger, and more esteemed than the last.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the races of silkworms have, let us here\r\nmention, white and yellow cocoons; there are some, however, whose\r\ncocoons are of a greenish white, or even quite green, or of a reddish\r\ngreen. One race, raised in Tuscany, near Pistoia, has cocoons of a\r\npale rose colour; and, lastly, mention has been made of cocoons of a\r\npurple colour.\r\n\r\nWhen the cocoons are completed, the people in charge of the rearing\r\nestablishments separate them from the heather and sell them to the\r\nsilk-spinners. But they must manage to get these cocoons into a state\r\nin which they will remain entire during a long time. They must, in\r\nother words, kill the chrysalis, to prevent the cocoons being pierced\r\nby the moth. To kill the chrysalis so as to prevent the development\r\nof the imago is an operation which is called the _étouffage_, or\r\nstifling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216.--Larva, pupa, cocoon, and moth of Bombyx mori.]\r\n\r\nTo effect this stifling, the cocoons are exposed to a high\r\ntemperature. Formerly, in the Cévennes, the cocoons were placed in a\r\nbaker's oven, heated for baking bread. But they ran the risk thus of\r\nbeing burnt, or of a certain number of chrysalides remaining alive.\r\nNow, to kill the chrysalides, they make use of steam at 100°, produced\r\nby water boiling in a vessel, and which passes through wicker baskets\r\nfilled with cocoons.\r\n\r\nThe rearer must also take care at the time he gathers them, to\r\nseparate the cocoons which are to provide eggs for the next year. As\r\nthe female cocoons are heavier than the male cocoons, they are easily\r\nseparated by weighing them in a pair of scales.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the eggs, or grain, the cocoons are fixed on sheets of brown\r\npaper, covered with a slight coating of paste made of flour. They are\r\narranged in such a manner that the moths shall find no obstacle when\r\nthey come out of them, head foremost; and, moreover, so that they may\r\nbe able to reach with their legs the cocoon which is opposite them, so\r\nas to hang on to it, and to facilitate their exit from their own\r\ncocoon (Fig. 218). The male and female cocoons are pasted on separate\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217.--Apparatus for stifling the chrysalides in\r\nthe cocoons.]\r\n\r\nIt is from fifteen to twenty days after the _montée_, or _mounting_,\r\nand when the temperature of the rooms has been kept between 20° and\r\n25°, that the moths begin to be hatched. As they appear, they are\r\nseized by the wings and placed on cloths stretched out for the\r\npurpose, where they are left for about an hour, till their wings have\r\nfallen flat on their bodies. As soon as they have evacuated a red\r\nliquor, the males and females, which up to that time have been apart,\r\nare put together.\r\n\r\nThey then stick sheets of paper on to screens, putting from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty females on each sheet (Fig. 219). It is here the\r\nmoths lay their eggs. The sheets of paper, covered with eggs, are then\r\nhung on wires, at a small distance from the ceiling of a room having\r\na northern aspect, which is never warmed. They remain thus, exposed to\r\nall variations of temperature, till the return of the warm weather. We\r\nwill say a few words, to bring this subject to an end, on the winding\r\nof cocoons and the spinning of silk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.--Sheet of paper with rows of cocoons prepared\r\nfor the exit of the moths destined for laying eggs.]\r\n\r\nThe winding of cocoons is an operation which at first sight appears\r\nvery simple, but which is in reality a difficult and delicate process.\r\nIt requires unremitting attention, great experience, and a delicacy of\r\ntouch which can only be found in the fingers of woman, or rather, in\r\nthe fingers of certain women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.--Sheets of paper stuck into screens, and\r\ninclined for the reception of moths.]\r\n\r\nThe woman who is spinning, stands before a sort of loom which is\r\ncalled _tour_ (Fig. 220). Under her hand is a copper containing water,\r\nwhich she heats to the required degree by opening the tap of a tube,\r\nwhich brings a current of steam. She plunges the cocoons into the hot\r\nwater, and moves them about in it, to soften the gummy substance which\r\nsticks the silken threads of the cocoon together. Then she beats them,\r\nwith a light hand, with a small birch-broom. The threads of the\r\ncocoons get caught in the extremities of the twigs of which the little\r\nbroom is made, and the workwoman seizes with her fingers the bundle of\r\nthreads, and shakes them about till she perceives that they are all\r\nsingle, and in a fit state to be joined together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.--Silk-winding Establishment.]\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that it is wished now to make up a _brin_, or staple,\r\nby uniting together the ends of five cocoons. She chooses five ends in\r\nthe mass, makes of these a bundle, and introduces it into the hole of\r\na _filière_. She makes two staples (_brins_) at once, one on her\r\nright, the other on her left hand. She then brings them together, she\r\ncrosses them, rolls them, and twists them, the one on the other,\r\nseveral times; after which, she separates them from above and keeps\r\nthem well apart, making each of them pass into a hook at a distance,\r\nfrom which they are going to twist round into a hank, separately, on a\r\nwheel. The two threads thus twisted are drawn close together,\r\ncompressed, and become one, getting round by rolling on each other,\r\nand being kept in continual motion, drawn out as they are by the rapid\r\nmotion of the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which the emptying the cocoon of its silk thread\r\npresents, makes us understand what difficulties those manufacturers\r\nmust have met with who have lately attempted to extract from the\r\nstalks of mulberry leaves a sort of silk. We will enter into no\r\ndetails of the attempts which have been made to accomplish this object\r\nin our time, attempts which have, however, been crowned with no\r\nsuccess whatever. We will confine ourselves to reminding the reader\r\nthat these attempts are far from being of recent origination, since\r\nthey date back to as far as Olivier de Serres, the father of French\r\nsericulture.\r\n\r\nIn a little work published by Olivier de Serres, in 1603, under the\r\ntitle of _Cueillette de la Soie_, \"The Gathering of Silk,\" we find a\r\nmemoir entitled: _La second richesse du mûrier, qui se trouve en son\r\nescorce, pour en faire des toiles de toute sorte, non moins utile que\r\nla soie provenant d'icelui_, \"The second wealth of the mulberry tree\r\nwhich is found in its bark, how to make of it cloth of all sorts, not\r\nless useful than the silk derived from this tree.\" Olivier de Serres\r\nproves in this memoir that the second bark, or _liber_, of the\r\nmulberry tree contains a fibre capable of replacing hemp or flax, and\r\nhe describes the processes by which this may be obtained. The\r\nprocesses which had been proposed by Olivier de Serres in 1603, were\r\nresumed in the Cévennes a dozen years ago by M. Duponchel on the one\r\nhand, and on the other by M. Cabanis,[64] who operated on the bark\r\ninstead of taking the whole of the wood of the mulberry tree. But none\r\nof these attempts have given any good results up to the present\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n    [64] See the \"Année scientifique,\" 7e année, p. 432.\r\n\r\nThe various diseases which for the last fifteen years have been so\r\nfatal to the mulberry silkworm, have suggested the idea of\r\nacclimatising in Europe other silk-producing Bombyces, if not with\r\nthe view of superseding, at least as auxiliaries to the mulberry\r\nspecies. The genus _Attacus_ has furnished these auxiliaries. Among\r\nthe species which have, in this respect, the greatest claims to our\r\nattention, we must place in the first rank those which feed upon the\r\nleaves of the oak tree. Indeed, the trees which can be made use of for\r\ntheir cultivation are very numerous in Europe, and, moreover, the silk\r\nproduced by these worms appears to possess superior qualities.\r\n\r\nThere are three oak-feeding species of the genus _Attacus_. They are\r\n_Yama-Maï_, _Pernyi_, and _Mylitta_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.--Larva of Attacus (Bombyx) Yama-Maï.]\r\n\r\nThe silk of _Yama-Maï_ is as bright as that of the mulberry silkworm,\r\nbut a little less fine and strong, and occupies the first rank after\r\nit. If we could succeed in acclimatising this species it would supply\r\nany deficiency there might be in our crops of ordinary silk.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the _Attacus Yama-Maï_ were brought from Japan--where this\r\nworm is reared--conjointly with the mulberry silkworm, in 1862. The\r\nlarvæ hatched at Paris, in 1863, were green, of a great size, remained\r\nin that state eighty-two days, and were easily reared. Their cocoon\r\nresembles that of the mulberry species. It is composed of a beautiful\r\nsilk of a silvery whiteness in the interior, and of a more or less\r\nbright green on the exterior. The moth is very large and beautiful, of\r\na bright yellow colour, approaching orange.\r\n\r\nWe give a drawing of the _Attacus Yama-Maï_, taken from the plates\r\nwhich accompany M. Guérin-Méneville's memoir.[65]\r\n\r\n    [65] Sur le Ver à Soie du Chêne, et son Introduction en Europe.\r\n    Extrait du Magasin de Zoologie, 1855, No. VI.\r\n\r\n    [For an account of experiments conducted in England by Dr.\r\n    Wallace, whichunfortunately were complete failures as far as\r\n    rearing the moth went, see an essay by that gentleman in _The\r\n    Transactions of the Entomological Society of London_, 3rd\r\n    series, vol. v., pt. 5; Longmans and Co. The results of an\r\n    experiment which give the greatest hopes of success, will be\r\n    found in \"The Entomologist\" for October, 1867.--ED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222.--Cocoon of Attacus (Bombyx) Yama-Maï.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223.--Attacus (Bombyx) Yama-Maï.]\r\n\r\nFig. 221 represents the larva, or caterpillar, two-thirds natural\r\nsize; Fig. 222, the cocoon, drawn on the same scale; and Fig. 223, the\r\nmoth.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, M. Camille Personnat published a very interesting monograph\r\nof _Yama-Maï_, which may be consulted with profit by both cultivators\r\nof silk and naturalists.[66]\r\n\r\n    [66] Le Ver à Soie du Chêne (_Bombyx Yama Maï_), son histoire,\r\n    sa description, ses moeurs. 8vo., avec planches coloriées. A\r\n    Laval, à l'école de sériculture.\r\n\r\n_Attacus pernyi_ yields a remarkably beautiful silk, fine, strong, and\r\nbrilliant, which can be spun and dyed with great ease. The tissues\r\nobtained from it partake of the qualities of ordinary silk, of wool,\r\nand of cotton. This species of _Attacus_, which is reared on the oak\r\nin Mandchouria, has given rise to great hopes in France. The cocoons\r\nand moths of this worm were exhibited for the first time at the\r\nUniversal Exhibition of 1855. They were reared by M. Jordan, of Lyons,\r\nfrom some cocoons sent over from China by the missionaries. It is much\r\nto be desired that this species may be acclimatised in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.--Cocoon of Attacus (Bombyx) pernyi.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 224 and 225 represent, after drawings in the Memoir of M.\r\nGuérin-Méneville, already referred to, the cocoon and moth of the\r\n_Attacus pernyi_.\r\n\r\nThe silk which _Attacus Mylitta_ produces is perhaps superior to that\r\nof _Pernyi_. When the cocoons are properly prepared, the silk can with\r\nease be wound off from one end of them to the other. This worm is\r\nfound in various parts of Bengal and of Calcutta, and also at Lahore,\r\nand its silk is exported in considerable quantities under the name of\r\n_tusseh_. Brownish stuffs are made of it in India of firm and bright\r\ntexture, which are used for summer clothing, or for covering\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.--Attacus (Bombyx) pernyi.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 226 and 227 represent the moth and the cocoon of _Attacus\r\nMylitta_ after M. Guérin-Méneville.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226.--Attacus (Bombyx) Mylitta.]\r\n\r\nIn 1855 M. de Chavannes reared this species in the open air, near\r\nLausanne, in Switzerland. This treatment succeeded perfectly, without\r\nany degeneration, for many years. It, however, died out at last, from\r\nthe effects, perhaps, of too great a difference in the climate, or\r\nfrom those accidents, still so little understood, to which even the\r\ninsects of our own country are subject. This was unfortunate, as this\r\nspecies is one of those whose acclimatisation in Europe is the most to\r\nbe desired, for it would render great service to the cultivators of\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to speak of two other species, which are very\r\nimportant, inasmuch as their domestication in Europe is now an\r\naccomplished fact. We mean the _Attacus_ or _Bombyx_ of the Ailanthus,\r\nand also that of the Castor-oil plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227.--Cocoon of Attacus (Bombyx) Mylitta.]\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the Ailanthus silkworm (_Attacus_ [_Bombyx_]\r\n_Cynthia_), whose acclimatisation in Europe has been materially\r\nassisted by the admirable and persevering efforts of M.\r\nGuérin-Méneville.\r\n\r\nThe Ailanthus worm is a native of Japan and of the north of China. It\r\nwas brought over in 1858 by Annibale Fantoni, and sent to M.\r\nGuérin-Méneville by MM. Griseri and Colomba, of Turin. When it is\r\nnearly full-grown it is emerald green, with the head, the feet, and\r\nthe last segment of a beautiful golden yellow, and has black spots on\r\neach segment. This worm, in its full-grown state, is represented by\r\nFig. 228; in the same figure are also represented the eggs and the\r\ncocoon. The moth has the abdomen yellowish underneath, with little\r\nwhite tufts. Its wings are traversed by a white band, which is\r\nfollowed exteriorly by a line of a bright rose; each wing is also\r\nmarked by a lunula or crescent-shaped spot.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 M. Guérin-Méneville presented to the Académie des Sciences of\r\nParis the first moths and the first eggs laid in France of the\r\n_Attacus Cynthia_. This able entomologist demonstrated very soon\r\nafterwards--1st, that the caterpillars of this insect can be reared in\r\nthe open air, and with scarcely any cost for management; 2ndly, that\r\nit produces two crops a year in the climate of Paris and the north of\r\nFrance; 3rdly, that the cultivation of the Ailanthus, or the false\r\nJapan varnish tree, on which this insect lives, is easy even in the\r\nmost sterile soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228.--Eggs, larvæ, and cocoons of Attacus (Bombyx)\r\nCynthia.]\r\n\r\nM. Guérin-Méneville showed still further that _ailantine_, the textile\r\nmatter furnished by the cocoon of the Cynthia, is a sort of floss silk\r\nholding a middle place between wool and the silk of the mulberry-tree\r\nworm, and which, as it can be produced at scarcely any expense, would\r\nbe very cheap, and would serve for the fabrication of what are called\r\nfancy stuffs, for which ordinary floss silk is now used. In 1862 M.\r\nGuérin-Méneville sent in a Report to the Minister of Agriculture on\r\nthe progress of the cultivation of the Ailanthus, and of the breeding\r\nof the silkworm, which was reared in the open air on this tree. He\r\nmentions, in his Report, the rapid development of the cultivation of\r\nthe tree in France, the great number of eggs of the Ailanthus silkworm\r\nsold, the foundation of a model silkworm nursery at Vincennes, and,\r\nthis one great point gained, that they had found out the way of\r\nunwinding the silk from the cocoons of the _Cynthia_ in one unbroken\r\nand continuous thread.\r\n\r\nTill then European industry had only succeeded in drawing from the\r\ncocoons of the Ailanthus silkworm a floss silk, composed of filaments\r\nmore or less short, obtained by carding, and unable to produce, when\r\ntwisted, anything better than floss, that is to say, refuse silk. It\r\nis to the Countess de Vernéde de Corneillan, on the one hand, and to\r\nDoctor Forgemot on the other, that the merit is due of having obtained\r\nan unbroken thread of silk from the cocoon of _Attacus Cynthia_.\r\n\r\nA monograph on the Ailanthus silkworm appeared in 1866 under the\r\ntitle, \"L'Ailante et son Bombyx, par Henri Givelet.\"[67] It is a\r\ncomplete account of all the results obtained up to the time, both as\r\nregards the rearing of the silkworm and also as regards the\r\ncultivation on a large scale of the Ailanthus, or false Japan varnish\r\ntree.[68]\r\n\r\n    [67] In 8vo, avec plans et planches coloriées. Paris, 1866.\r\n\r\n    [68] A work by M. Guérin-Méneville on the same subject,\r\n    entitled, \"Education des Vers à Soie de l'Ailante et du Ricin,\"\r\n    in 12mo., Paris, 1860, may also be consulted.\r\n\r\n    [For a full account of successful experiments carried on in\r\n    England, see Dr. Wallace's essay in _The Transactions of the\r\n    Entomological Society of London_, 3rd series, vol. v., pt. 2;\r\n    Longmans and Co.--ED.]\r\n\r\nThe Castor-oil Plant Silkworm (_Attacus_ [_Bombyx_] _ricini_) is a\r\nspecies very nearly akin to the Ailanthus worm, perhaps only a\r\nvariety, and comes from India. The silk which it produces is very\r\nsimilar in every respect to that of the _Cynthia_. The rearing of this\r\nworm could never attain to any great importance in France, on account\r\nof the necessity there is of renewing the plantations of the\r\ncastor-oil plant each year. It would, however, afford an additional\r\nsource of income to the farmers in the south of France, who cultivate\r\nthe castor-oil plant with a view to selling its seeds, which are much\r\nused in pharmacy.\r\n\r\nNearly allied to the genus _Attacus_, which furnishes us with all\r\nthese precious auxiliaries to the mulberry silkworm, are a great\r\nnumber of other species, both indigenous to Europe and exotic, mostly\r\nremarkable for their great size, and a few of which are common in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFig. 229 is the largest European moth, but never found farther north\r\nthan the latitude of Paris. Its wings are brown, waved, and variegated\r\nwith grey. Each of them has a large black eye-shaped spot, surrounded\r\nby a tawny circle, surmounted by one white semicircle, and by another\r\nof a reddish hue, the whole completely enclosed in a black circle.\r\n\"These moths,\" says Geoffroy, \"are very large; they look as if they\r\nwere covered with fur, and, when they fly, one is inclined to take\r\nthem for birds.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229.--Saturnia pavonia-major.]\r\n\r\n_Saturnia pavonia-major_ comes from a very large caterpillar, which is\r\nof a beautiful green, with tubercles of turquoise blue, each of which\r\nis surmounted by seven stiff divergent hairs. This caterpillar lives\r\nprincipally upon the elm, but it feeds also upon the leaves of the\r\npear, plum, and other trees. It spins a brown cocoon, formed of a\r\ncoarse silk of great strength. It is not until the following spring\r\nthat it becomes a moth.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Moth (_Saturnia carpini_, Fig. 230) much resembles the\r\nabove, except in size. This species is common in England, and its\r\ngreen larva, covered with black or pink warts, from which spring\r\nhairs, as in the last, is by no means rare on heath in the autumn. It\r\nalso feeds on bramble and other plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230.--Emperor Moth (_Saturnia carpini_).]\r\n\r\nAmong the _Attaci_ foreign to Europe, we must mention _Atlas_ (Fig.\r\n231), the expanse of whose wings exceeds four and a quarter inches.\r\nThis magnificent moth, one of the largest known, comes from China.\r\n\r\nThe family _Bombycidæ_ comprises many species which we must not omit\r\nto mention.\r\n\r\nThe Lackey (_Bombyx neustria_) derives its name from the colour of the\r\ncaterpillar, which has longitudinal lines of various colours, and a\r\nblue head. These caterpillars live together on a great number of our\r\nforest and garden trees, to which they do much damage. The moth (Fig.\r\n232) has a brownish body, and wings of a more or less tawny yellow\r\ncolour, with two darker lines on the front wings.\r\n\r\nThe Procession Moth (_Bombyx processionea_) is a small greyish moth,\r\nthe caterpillars of which live in numerous troops on oak trees, and\r\ndevour the leaves at the moment of their development. In the evening\r\nthese caterpillars come out of their common nest, and form a sort of\r\nprocession; hence their name Procession Moth. \"I kept some for a\r\nlittle time in my house in the country,\" says Réaumur. \"I brought an\r\noak branch which was covered with them into my study, where I could\r\nmuch better follow the order and regularity of their march than I\r\ncould have done in the woods. I was very much amused and pleased at\r\nwatching them for many days. I hung the branch on which I had brought\r\nthem against one of my window shutters. When the leaves were dried up,\r\nwhen they had become too hard for the jaws of the caterpillars, they\r\ntried to go and seek better food elsewhere. One set himself in motion,\r\na second followed at his tail, a third followed this one, and so on.\r\nThey began to defile and march up the shutter, but being so near to\r\neach other that the head of the second touched the tail of the first.\r\nThe single file was throughout continuous; it formed a perfect string\r\nof caterpillars of about two feet in length, after which the line was\r\ndoubled. There two caterpillars marched abreast, but as near the one\r\nwhich preceded them as those who were marching in single file were to\r\neach other. After a few rows of our processionists who were two\r\nabreast, came the rows of three abreast; after a few of these came\r\nthose which were four abreast; then there were those of five, others\r\nof six, others of seven, others of eight caterpillars. This troop, so\r\nwell marshalled, was led by the first. Did it halt, all the others\r\nhalted; did it again begin to march, all the others set themselves in\r\nmotion, and followed with the greatest precision.... That which went\r\non in my study goes on every day in the woods where these caterpillars\r\nlive.... When it is near sunset you may see one caterpillar coming out\r\nof any of the nests, by the opening which is at the top, which would\r\nhardly afford space for two to come out abreast. As soon as it has\r\nemerged from the nest, it is followed by many others in single file;\r\nwhen it has got about two feet from the nest, it makes a pause, during\r\nwhich those who are still in the nest continue to come out; they fall\r\ninto their ranks, the battalion is formed; at last the leader sets off\r\nmarching again, and all the others follow him. That which goes on in\r\nthis nest takes place in all the neighbouring nests; all are evacuated\r\nat the same time.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231.--Attacus (Bombyx) Atlas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.--The Lackey (_Bombyx neustria_).]\r\n\r\nOne part of Fig. 233 shows the arrangement of the caterpillars on\r\ncoming out of the nest. These caterpillars are furnished with long\r\nhairs, slightly tufted, which come off with the greatest ease, and\r\nwhich if they penetrate into the skin, cause violent itching. In 1865\r\na number of the alleys of the Bois de Boulogne were shut up from the\r\npublic in order to save them from this annoyance. These caterpillars\r\nconstruct a covering common to them all, in which they live, and\r\ntransform themselves therein, each insect making for his own private\r\nuse a small cocoon. This insect is said to have been found in England,\r\nbut there is not sufficient evidence to admit it into our lists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.--Larvæ of the Procession Moth (_Bombyx\r\nprocessionea_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.--The Vapourer Moth (_Orgyia antiqua_), male\r\nand female.]\r\n\r\nThe _Orgyias_ comprise a great number of small species, of a dark\r\ncolour, which do a great deal of damage to our forest trees. In\r\nSeptember and October the male of the _Orgyia antiqua_, with his\r\ntawny wings, may often be seen flying about the streets of London. The\r\nfemale (Fig. 234) is remarkable, as she has only the rudiments of\r\nwings, and only goes as far as the side of her cocoon. The caterpillar\r\nof the _Orgyia pudibunda_, called also the Hop Dog, attacks almost\r\nevery sort of tree. When the state of the atmosphere favours their\r\npropagation, they appear in fearful quantities, and cause the greatest\r\nhavoc. During the autumn of 1828, in the environs of Phalsbourg, they\r\nwere to be counted by millions. The extent of the woods laid waste was\r\ncalculated at about fifteen hundred hectares. It is common in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.--Orgyia pudibunda.]\r\n\r\nAmong the genus _Liparis_, the species of which are also very\r\ndestructive to trees, we must mention the Brown-tailed Moth (_Liparis\r\nchrysorrhoea_, Fig. 236), a species by no means rare in England.\r\nThe caterpillars live in quantities, on apple, pear, and elm trees,\r\nand destroy the plantations of the promenades of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.--Liparis chrysorrhoea.]\r\n\r\nThe females of this genus tear off the fur from the extremity of their\r\nabdomens to make a soft bed for their eggs, and to preserve them from\r\nthe cold. And yet they are never to see their young, for they die\r\nafter they have laid their eggs. Another tribe of _Bombycina_ contains\r\nspecies of a small size, which are remarkable from the habits of their\r\ncaterpillars, which make, with foreign bodies, cases, in the interior\r\nof which they live and undergo their metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of the genus _Psyche_ live in a case composed of\r\nfragments of leaves, of bits of grass and straw, of small sticks of\r\nwood, or of little stones, stuck together, and intermixed with silky\r\nthreads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.--Case of Psyche muscella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238.--Psyche muscella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.--Case of Pysche rubicolella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.--Case of Psyche graminella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.--Larva of Psyche graminella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.--Psyche graminella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII. The Goat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_). Larva, pupa,\r\nand perfect insect. 1, 2. Perfect insect. 3. Pupa. 4. Larva.]\r\n\r\nWe give a representation (in Figs. 237, 239, and 240) of the cases of\r\nthe caterpillars of three different kinds. The females of these moths\r\nare completely destitute of wings, and resemble caterpillars. As a\r\ngeneral rule they hardly ever leave their case. The males (Figs. 238,\r\n242) are of a blackish grey, and fly very swiftly.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of the genus _Hepialus_ are difficult to observe, as\r\nthey live in the interior of the roots of various vegetables. Such is\r\nthe common Ghost Moth (_Hepialus humuli_), which sometimes causes the\r\ngreatest damage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.--Zeuzera æsculi.]\r\n\r\nThe type of the genus _Zeuzera_ is _Zeuzera æsculi_, or Wood Leopard\r\n(Fig. 243). It has white wings with large blackish blue spots on the\r\nanterior, and small black spots on the posterior wings. The\r\ncaterpillar, of a vivid yellow, spotted with black, lives in the\r\ninterior of the trunks of a great many trees, principally the\r\nchestnut, the elm, the lime, and the pear tree. This moth, which is\r\nknown also by the name of Coquette, is to be seen in the evening\r\nflying about the public gardens of Paris, and is not rare in England.\r\nThe most celebrated species of the allied genus _Cossus_ is the\r\nWood-boring Goat Moth (_Cossus ligniperda_), figured in the opposite\r\nplate. The moth has a heavy brownish body and greyish wings streaked\r\nwith black. It is found in most parts of Europe. The caterpillar is of\r\na reddish colour, as if it had on a leathern jerkin, and disgorges a\r\nliquid which is believed to soften ligneous fibres, and it lives in\r\nthe interior of willows and other trees. It was on this caterpillar\r\nthat Lyonnet made his admirable anatomical researches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.--Larva of Dicranura vinula.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.--Dicranura vinula.]\r\n\r\nAnother tribe of _Bombycina_ comprises some very strange caterpillars,\r\nwhose hindermost feet are changed into forked prolongations, which\r\nthey move about in a threatening manner. These sort of fly-traps\r\nare perhaps meant to keep at a distance those insects which would\r\nlay their eggs upon the caterpillar's body. The caterpillars of\r\n_Dicranura_ are of this kind. We give a representation of the\r\ncaterpillar and the moth of the Puss Moth (_Dicranura vinula_, Figs.\r\n244, 245), as also the moth of the _Dicranura verbasci_, the former of\r\nwhich is common in England, and the larva may be found during the late\r\nsummer and early autumn feeding on poplars and willows; and of the\r\ncaterpillar of _Stauropus fagi_, the Lobster Moth (Fig. 247), rare in\r\nFrance, whose appearance is strange indeed. The moths, on the\r\ncontrary, have nothing about them remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.--Dicranura verbasci.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.--Larva of the Lobster Moth (_Stauropus fagi_).]\r\n\r\nThe _Noctuina_ are a group of Lepidoptera of middling size, and\r\ngenerally found in woods, meadows, and gardens, where their\r\ncaterpillars have lived. They seldom fly till about sunset, or during\r\nthe night. Their upper wings are of a dark colour, with spots in the\r\nmiddle of a particular shape. Their lower wings are of various\r\ncolours, often whitish, sometimes red or yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.--Noctua tegamon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.--Noctua nebulosa.]\r\n\r\nWe give representations of some of the species of this group.[69]\r\n_Noctua tegamon_, Fig. 248; _Noctua nebulosa_, Fig. 249; _Noctua\r\nmusiva_, Fig. 250; _Noctua brunnea_, Fig. 251; _Catocala fraxini_,\r\nFig. 252; _Catocala Americana_, Fig. 253; _Catocala paranympha_, Fig.\r\n254; _Catocala nupta_, Fig. 255, the Red Underwing; and _Erebus\r\nstrix_, Fig. 256.\r\n\r\n    [69] In England it numbers about three hundred species. The\r\n    larvæ are of diverse habits, but the majority feed on low\r\n    plants; the moths are provided with a trunk, and are very\r\n    partial to sweets.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.--Noctua musiva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.--Noctua brunnea.]\r\n\r\nThe bodies of these moths are robust and sometimes massive, and are\r\nscaly rather than woolly. The thorax is sometimes bristling with hairy\r\ntufts.\r\n\r\nThis genus includes 800 species, of which there are about 300 in\r\nFrance. The caterpillars of the _Noctuina_ are smooth or very\r\nslightly covered with hair, usually of a pale colour, and live on low\r\nplants, of which they devour, some the leaves, others the roots; then\r\nit is they are most destructive to agriculture. There are some of them\r\nwhich eat any caterpillars they may chance to meet, and even those of\r\ntheir own species, leaving nothing but the skin. Some of them surround\r\nthemselves with a light cocoon before becoming chrysalides; others\r\nbury themselves in soft, well-pulverised soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252.--Catocala fraxini.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.--Catocala Americana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.--Catocala paranympha.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.--Catocala nupta.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256.--Erebus strix.]\r\n\r\nThe family of _Geometrinæ_, or Geometers, comprises moths of a\r\nmiddling size, and usually flying after sunset and during the\r\nnight.[70] They frequent the alleys of damp woods, where they become\r\nthe prey of the _Libellulæ_[71] and other carnivorous insects. Their\r\nbodies and abdomens are slender, their wings large, thin, fragile,\r\noften of a dark colour, with brilliant markings.\r\n\r\n    [70] few species fly in bright sunshine.--ED.\r\n\r\n    [71] Dragon-flies.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of the _Geometrinæ_ are known by the name of\r\nloopers or geometers. We have previously described their singular\r\norganisation. They are continually spinning a silken thread, which\r\nkeeps them attached to the plant on which they live. If you touch the\r\nleaf which supports them they immediately let themselves fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.--Looper hanging by its thread.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.--Seen at the side.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.--Front view.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 260 and 261.--Remounting its thread.]\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, they do not generally fall to the ground,\" says\r\nRéaumur; \"there is a cord ready to support them in the air (Fig. 257),\r\nand a cord which they can lengthen as they will; this cord is only a\r\nvery thin thread, but has nevertheless strength enough to support the\r\ncaterpillar (Figs. 258, 259). All that there seems to fear is, that\r\nthe thread may lengthen too quickly and the caterpillar fall, rather\r\nthan descend gently, to the ground. But what we must first remark and\r\nadmire is, that the caterpillar is mistress of its movements, and is\r\nnot obliged to descend too quickly; it descends by stages; it stops in\r\nthe air when it pleases. Generally it only descends at most about one\r\nfoot at a time, and sometimes only half a foot or a few inches, after\r\nwhich it makes a pause more or less long, as it pleases.\" It is in\r\nthis way that the caterpillars let themselves fall from the top of the\r\nhighest trees: they remount again with no less ease.\r\n\r\nLet us listen to Réaumur's description of the means employed by this\r\ncaterpillar to ascend these heights. Figs. 260 and 261, drawn, as the\r\nthree preceding ones, from the plates in Réaumur's Memoir, help us to\r\nfollow the explanation given by the illustrious naturalist of the\r\nevolutions of our little acrobat:--\"To remount,\" says Réaumur, \"the\r\ncaterpillar seizes the thread between its jaws, as high up as it can;\r\nas soon as it has done this it twists its head round, lays it over on\r\none side, and continues to do so more and more every moment. Its head\r\nseems to descend below the last of the scaly legs which are on the\r\nsame side as that to which it is inclined. The truth is, however, that\r\nit is not its head which descends, the part of the thread which it\r\nholds between its jaws is a fixed point for its head and for the rest\r\nof its body; it is that portion of the back corresponding with its\r\nscaly legs which the caterpillar twists upwards; the consequence is\r\nthat the scaly legs and that part of the body to which they belong\r\nthen ascend. When the last pair of legs is just over the jaws of the\r\ncaterpillar, one leg, viz., that which is on the side towards which\r\nthe head is inclined, seizes the thread and brings it over to the\r\ncorresponding leg on the other side, which is advanced to receive it.\r\nIf the head is then raised, which is done immediately, it is in order\r\nthat it may seize the thread at a higher point than that at which it\r\nwas caught at first; or, which is the same thing, the head, and\r\nconsequently the whole body of the caterpillar, is found to have\r\nascended to a height equal to the length of the thread which is\r\nbetween the place where its jaws seized it the first time and that\r\nwhere they seized it the second time. The first move in the upward\r\ndirection is thus made, and the second soon follows.... If you were to\r\nseize the caterpillar on its arrival at the end of its upward journey,\r\nyou would see a packet of threads huddled together between the four\r\nhindmost of the scaly legs. The greater the height ascended the\r\ngreater is the size of this packet. All the turns of the thread which\r\ncompose it are entangled. So the caterpillar does not consider it of\r\nany value. As soon as the insect can walk it gets rid of the mass,\r\nsets its legs free, and leaves it behind before one or at most two\r\nsteps have been taken. The cord is wasted on each ascent, but the\r\ncaterpillar can afford to lose as many as it likes, for it has in\r\nitself the source of the matter necessary for the composition of the\r\nthread, and it is a source from which that which was drawn off is\r\nbeing continually re-supplied. Moreover, spinning the thread costs the\r\ncaterpillars but little; indeed, the loopers economise this thread so\r\nbadly that most of them leave it behind them wherever they go.\"\r\n\r\nThey are found on many trees, but particularly on the oak, the foliage\r\nof which they often entirely devour. They burrow into the ground to\r\nchange into chrysalides, and undergo all their metamorphoses in the\r\ncourse of the year. Others do not become perfect insects till the\r\nautumn, or sometimes not even till the following spring. A few assume\r\nthe perfect state in winter. There are, indeed, some of these, such as\r\nthe males of the _Hybernias_, which fly about on the foggy evenings of\r\nNovember. The females of this genus have either no wings at all, or\r\nelse only rudimentary ones. Two species, the _Hybernia defoliaria_, or\r\nWinter Moth, and the _Chimatobia brumata_, abundant here, are very\r\ncommon in the environs of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.--Hybernia leucophearia, male.]\r\n\r\nM. Maurice Girard says, in his work on the metamorphoses of insects,\r\nthat the females of these moths can easily be found at the beginning\r\nof November, in a very strange place, namely, on the gas lamps of the\r\npublic promenades; for instance, along the roads in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne. No doubt they had climbed up to this height, attracted by\r\nthe light, or perhaps had been carried thither by the males, which\r\nfly, having wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.--Winter Moth (_Hybernia defoliaria_), male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264.--Winter Moth (_Hybernia defoliaria_), female.]\r\n\r\nIn February and March appear other analogous species. \"We may find,\"\r\nsays M. Maurice Girard, \"near Paris, in the meadows which surround the\r\nconfluence of the Seine and the Marne, at the end of the month of\r\nMarch, the _Nyssia zonaria_ (Fig. 267), the males of which insect\r\nremain during the day motionless on the grass.\"[72]\r\n\r\n    [72] With us this insect has a very limited range, being only\r\n    found at New Brighton, near Birkenhead, where it is most\r\n    abundant.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265.--Chimatobia brumata, male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.--Chimatobia brumata, female.]\r\n\r\nThere are some species of this family in which the wings of the\r\nfemales are developed like those of the males.[73] Such are the\r\nPeppered Moth (_Amphidasis betularia_) and the Currant Moth (_Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata_), whose caterpillar lives on the red currant and\r\ngooseberry, and an immense number known as Thorns, Carpets, Waves, &c.\r\n\r\n    [73] The exception is with those in which the wings are _not_\r\n    developed in both cases, and in England this peculiarity is\r\n    confined to species appearing during the winter and early\r\n    spring.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.--Nyssia zonaria, male and female.]\r\n\r\nThe section of the _Pyralina_ contains the smallest nocturnal\r\nLepidoptera, and nearly all those tiny species which flutter round our\r\nlights in the evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268.--Penthina pruniana.]\r\n\r\nHere are some drawings of a few of the numerous species of this\r\nsection, remarkable for their small size and beauty:--_Penthina\r\npruniana_, _Ædia pusiella_, _Xylopoda fabriciana_, _Poedisca\r\nautumnana_, _Tortrix roborana_, _Philobacera fagana_, _Tortrix\r\nsorbiana_, _Antithesia salicana_, _Poedisca occultana_, _Argyrolepia\r\næneana_, _Sericoris Zinkenana_, _Sarrothripa revayana_, _Cochylis\r\nfrancilana_, _Choreutes dolosana_ (Figs. 268 to 281).[74]\r\n\r\n    [74] Many of these are placed by some authors among the\r\n    Pyralina, and by others among the Tortricina.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.--Ædia pusiella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270.--Xylopoda fabriciana.]\r\n\r\nIn a book of this kind we can only mention some types among these\r\nlast insects, which claim our attention in what we might almost call a\r\ntyrannical manner. We will, therefore, content ourselves by saying a\r\nfew words about the Green Tortrix, the Pyralis of the Vine, the\r\nBee-hive Moth, some species of the Clothes Moth family (_Tineina_),\r\nand finally of the _OEcophoræ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271.--Poedisca autumnana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272.--Tortrix roborana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273.--Philobacera fagana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274.--Tortrix sorbiana.]\r\n\r\nThe Green Tortrix (_Tortrix viridana_) has wings of a green colour,\r\nwith the margin and fringe whitish on the anterior, and of an ashy\r\ngrey on the posterior wings. The under-side of the four wings is of a\r\nbright white, as if it had been silvered. This pretty moth comes out\r\nin the month of May. It is so common everywhere, that at this season\r\nit is only necessary to shake the branches of the oaks which border\r\nthe alleys of the woods to set in motion hundreds of them. The\r\ncaterpillar is green, with black warty spots, each having a hair of\r\nthe same colour. They are wonderfully lively, the moment they are\r\ndisturbed taking refuge in a rolled leaf, which serves them as a\r\ndwelling-place. If they are pursued, they let themselves fall by the\r\naid of a thread, and do not re-ascend till they think they can count\r\non repose and security. This, and many kindred species, do a great\r\ndeal of damage to our trees. They strip them of their leaves, and\r\nsometimes give them, during the first days of summer, the sad and\r\nmelancholy appearance which they present in the middle of winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275.--Antithesia salicana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276.--Poedisca occultana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277.--Argyrolepia æneana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278.--Sericoris Zinkenana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.--Sarrothripa revayana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.--Cochylis francilana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281.--Choreutes dolosana.]\r\n\r\nWe have just alluded to the tube formed of a rolled leaf, in which the\r\ncaterpillar takes refuge, and in which it lives. This tube it\r\nconstructs itself. Réaumur has devoted a magnificent chapter of his\r\nMemoirs to observations on the skill with which divers species of\r\ncaterpillars fold, roll, and bind the leaves of plants and trees,\r\nespecially those of the oak. Let us listen to the great observer:--\"If\r\none looks attentively at the leaves of the oak tree towards the middle\r\nof the spring, many of them will be seen to be rolled in different\r\nways. The exterior surface of the end of one of these leaves has, it\r\nappears, been rolled back towards the interior surface, in order to\r\ndescribe the first turn of a spiral, which is then covered by many\r\nother turns (Fig. 282). Some leaves are rolled towards their exterior\r\nsurfaces, others are rolled towards their interior surfaces, but in a\r\ntotally different direction. The length or axis of the first roll is\r\nperpendicular to the principal rib and to the stalk of the leaf, the\r\naxis of the latter parallel to the same rib (Fig. 283). Work of this\r\nkind would not be very difficult to perform for those who had fingers;\r\nbut caterpillars have neither fingers nor anything equivalent to\r\nfingers. Moreover, to have rolled the leaves is only to have done half\r\nthe work: they must be retained in a position from which their natural\r\nspring tends constantly to draw them. The mechanism to which the\r\ncaterpillars have recourse for this second part of their work is\r\neasily perceived. We see packets of threads attached by one end to the\r\nsurface of the roll, and by the other to the flat surface of the\r\nleaf. They are so many bands, so many little cords which hold out\r\nagainst the spring of the leaf. There are sometimes more than from ten\r\nto twelve of these bands arranged nearly in the self-same straight\r\nline. Each band is a packet of threads of white silk, pressed one\r\nagainst the other, and yet we must remember all are separate.\"[75]\r\n\r\n    [75] Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes, tome ii.,\r\n    page 210 (5e Mémoire).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.--Oak leaf rolled perpendicularly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283.--Oak leaf rolled sideways.]\r\n\r\nRéaumur made the oak-leaf rollers work in his house. He has admirably\r\ndescribed all their little manoeuvres, but we lack the space to\r\nconvey to the reader the result of his minute observations. In fact,\r\nthe leaf-rollers construct for themselves a sort of cylindrical cell,\r\nwhich receives light only through the two extremities. The convenience\r\nof this green fresh habitation is, that its walls furnish food to the\r\nanimal which inhabits it. The caterpillar, thus sheltered, sets to\r\nwork to gnaw away at the end of the leaf which it rolled first; it\r\nthen eats all the rolls it has made, up to the very last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284.--Leaf of sorrel, a portion of which is cut\r\nand rolled perpendicularly to the leaf.]\r\n\r\nRéaumur found also rolls which had been formed of two or three leaves\r\nrolled lengthwise, and he saw that the leaves which had occupied the\r\ncentre had been almost entirely eaten. He saw also caterpillars which\r\ncontinued to eat while they were making their habitation. Let us add\r\nthat one of the ends of the roll is the opening through which the\r\ncaterpillar casts its excrement; that the caterpillar can prepare\r\nitself a fresh roll if it is turned out of the first; and, lastly,\r\nthat it is in a rolled leaf that the caterpillar undergoes its\r\nmetamorphoses into a chrysalis and into a moth.\r\n\r\nRéaumur studied other leaf-rollers; for instance, those which roll the\r\nleaves of nettles and of sorrel. The last one works in a manner which\r\ndeserves to be mentioned. Its roll is of no particular shape, but it\r\nis its position which is remarkable. It is set upon the leaf like a\r\nninepin (Fig. 284). The caterpillar has not only to twist it up into a\r\nroll, but also to place it perpendicularly on the leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 285 and 286.--Willow leaves rolled by a\r\ncaterpillar, and section of a bundle of leaves drawn together by a\r\ncaterpillar.]\r\n\r\nNext to the rolling caterpillars, let us mention those which are\r\ncontented with folding the leaves. These caterpillars then lie in a\r\nsort of flat box. Besides the rolling and folding caterpillars, there\r\nare still those which bind up a good many leaves in one packet. These\r\npackets are to be found on nearly every tree and shrub, and the\r\ncaterpillar, lying nearly in the middle of the packet, is well\r\nsheltered, and surrounded by a good supply of food. We will content\r\nourselves by giving a drawing, after Réaumur, of the pretty\r\narrangement of the leaves of a species of willow (Figs. 285, 286). In\r\nthe figures we see the parcel bound together by the caterpillar. In\r\nthat to the right we see the transverse section of the packet of\r\nleaves magnified. At the two edges are seen the threads which keep the\r\nleaves together, and the cavity occupied by the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThe Vine Pyralis is produced from a leaf-rolling caterpillar, which\r\ndeserves our attention on account of the ravages which it has for some\r\ntime committed, and which it still commits in vineyards. It was at the\r\nend of the sixteenth century that this pyralis first showed itself in\r\nthe environs of Paris, in the territory of Argenteuil. \"The\r\ninhabitants of this commune,\" writes the Abbé Leboeuf, \"looked on\r\nthe insects which spoiled their vines in the spring of 1562 as a\r\nvisitation of God. The Bishop of Paris gave orders that they should\r\noffer up public prayers for the diminution of these insects, and that\r\nthey should join to their prayers, exorcisms, without leaving the\r\nchurch.\" Prayers, processions, exorcisms, were again had recourse to\r\nin 1629, in 1717, and in 1733, to stop the ravages of this insect\r\namong the vines of Colombes, in the territory of Aï.\r\n\r\nThe country of the Mâconnais and the Beaujolais became in their turn\r\nthe theatre of the ravages of the pyralis. These ravages very soon\r\nincreased and spread. In 1836, 1837, 1838, this plague raged in the\r\ndepartments of the Saône-et-Loire, of the Rhône, of the Côte-d'Or, of\r\nthe Marne, of the Seine-et-Oise, of the Charente-Inférieure, of the\r\nHaute-Garonne, of the Pyrénées-Orientales, and of the Hérault.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the losses which may be occasioned by the pyralis,\r\nin a period of ten years (1828-1837), twenty-three communes comprised\r\nin the two departments of the Saône-et-Loire and of the Rhône lost\r\n75,000 hectolitres of wine a year, which may be valued at 1,500,000\r\nfrancs. If we were to calculate the supply of articles of all sorts\r\nwhich this great number of casks of wine would have necessitated, the\r\nimposts on their transport, the duty, the taxes levied on their sale,\r\nthe carriage by land and water, which would have brought receipts into\r\nthe treasury, and lastly the diminution of taxes which had to be\r\ngranted for seven years to the vine proprietors in the department of\r\nthe Saône-et-Loire, and in 1837 in the department of the Rhône, and\r\nwhich amounted to a total of more than 100,000 francs, we shall find\r\nthat the ravages of the pyralis caused in these two departments an\r\nannual loss of 3,408,000 francs, and as the visitation lasted ten\r\nyears, we get the enormous sum total of 34,000,000 destroyed by the\r\nravages of one species of insect. The moth of the pyralis (Fig. 287)\r\nshows itself from the 10th to the 20th of June. It is yellowish, more\r\nor less shot with gold. When at rest, its wings are folded back one\r\nover the other like a roof. Its flight is of short duration; it\r\ncontents itself with going from one vine stock to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287.--The Vine Pyralis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288.--Caterpillar of the Vine Pyralis.]\r\n\r\nIt is at sunset mostly that you see the moths of the pyralis\r\nfluttering about. They remain quiet during the day, particularly when\r\nthe sun is at its hottest. They live on an average for ten days. The\r\nfemales lay their eggs--which are at first green, then yellowish, then\r\nbrown--on the lower surface of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289.--Chrysalis of the Vine Pyralis.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the pyralis (Fig. 288) is called, in vulgar\r\nparlance, according to the different places in which it occurs, vine\r\nworm, summer worm, vintage worm, shell. In the south of France it is\r\ncalled, in the patois of Languedoc, _babota_. Almost immediately after\r\nthey leave the eggs, the little caterpillars hide themselves in the\r\nfissures of the vine stocks or the props which support them. They spin\r\na small cocoon of a greyish silk, in which they remain curled up till\r\nthe month of May. From the moment the leaves begin to develop they\r\nthrow out threads here and there, entangling all the young shoots of\r\nthe vine, which gives a desolate appearance to the vineyards. The\r\nleaves of the vine are their favourite food, but they attack the seeds\r\nof the grape also. As they increase in size every day, the damage they\r\ndo goes on increasing, and has not reached the maximum of intensity\r\ntill the moment when the caterpillars are about to change into\r\nchrysalides. They are then three-quarters of an inch long and of a\r\nyellowish green colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290.--The Vine Pyralis in its three states. 1.\r\nLeaf with batches of eggs laid upon it. 2. Batches of recently laid\r\neggs. 3. Eggs in which caterpillars can be perceived. 4. Batch of eggs\r\nfrom which the caterpillars have already emerged. 5. Small\r\ncaterpillars hanging by threads. 6. Leaf with the chrysalis. 7.\r\nCaterpillar. 8. Moth.]\r\n\r\nFrom the 20th of June to the 10th of July they seek shelter in the dry\r\nand interlaced leaves which have already served them for places of\r\nrefuge and partly also for food, or else they make themselves a fresh\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two or three days, the caterpillar has become a\r\nchrysalis (Fig. 289), which in a short time assumes a brown colour.\r\nShut up in the interior of the cocoon which the caterpillar had spun\r\nbefore undergoing its metamorphosis, it changes into a moth at the end\r\nof from fourteen to sixteen days.\r\n\r\nThe best way to diminish the ravages of the pyralis is to pluck off\r\nthe leaves which are laden with eggs, and burn them, or bury them in\r\ndeep holes.\r\n\r\nFig. 290, which we devote to the conspicuous insect whose destructive\r\nhistory we have been here able to sketch only slightly, gives all the\r\nparticulars relating to this dangerous guest of the vineyards. On a\r\nbranch of the vine may be perceived the pyralis in the caterpillar\r\nstate, the eggs which have been laid by the moths, the chrysalides,\r\nand perfect insects. The eggs are shown at two periods of their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe Bee-hive or Wax Galleria is to be met with in all countries where\r\nbees are reared.\r\n\r\nThe moth (Fig. 291) hides itself during the day round about the\r\nbee-hives, and endeavours to make its way into them after sunset. The\r\ncaterpillar is of a dirty white, with brown warty spots, each\r\nsurmounted by a fine hair. It lives on wax, twines its threads round\r\nthe honeycomb, and very soon causes the larvæ contained in it to\r\nperish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291.--Galleria cerella.]\r\n\r\nWhen it emerges from the egg, which the female has laid in the\r\nhoneycomb, the caterpillar makes for itself with the wax a round tube,\r\nin which it is safe against the stings of the bees. This tube, at\r\nfirst very small, is lengthened and enlarged as the caterpillar\r\nincreases in size. It is generally from three to five inches in\r\nlength. It is in the interior of this that the caterpillar constructs\r\nitself a hard cocoon, resembling leather, and it changes into a\r\nbrownish chrysalis.\r\n\r\nA species of the genus _Butalis_, the _Butalis_ or _Alucita granella_,\r\nis, in certain cantons of France, one of the greatest pests to\r\nagriculture. The caterpillar of the _Tinea granella_ undergoes its\r\nmetamorphosis in the interior of grains of barley and of wheat, which\r\nit devours without being perceived from without. The female lays her\r\neggs on the grains of corn before they are ripe. From four to six days\r\nafter, the eggs are hatched, and the young caterpillars are hardly as\r\nthick as a hair. Each one takes possession of a grain of corn, and\r\npenetrates into it by an imperceptible opening. They eat the flower\r\nwithout injuring the teguments of the grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292.--Tinea granella.]\r\n\r\nWhen it has attained its full size it spins itself a cocoon of white\r\nsilk in the interior of the grain, which, after having been its\r\nlodging and its larder, becomes for some time its tomb. It has,\r\nhowever, taken care beforehand to make at the extremity of the grain a\r\ncircular opening, through which the moth may come out when the grains\r\nhave been threshed and stored up in the granary.\r\n\r\nIt is important to mention the _Tineina_, not because these little\r\nmoths are beautiful--they are, on the contrary, very dingy--but\r\nbecause it is in this group that are found those insects which do the\r\ngreatest damage to our crops. The moths of the genus _Tinea_ are very\r\nsmall. Their wings, which are greyish or brownish, are generally\r\nmarked with whitish and yellowish spots or lines. These are the little\r\nmoths which, in our houses, burn themselves so frequently in the\r\nflames of the candles.\r\n\r\nTheir caterpillars are small, voracious, and deserve, on account of\r\nthe damage which they cause, to be compared to rats and mice.\r\nFurnished with powerful jaws, they destroy everything they find in\r\ntheir way, such as woollen stuffs, hair, furs, feathers, grain, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _Tineina_ are divisible into three groups: 1st, the species\r\nhurtful to our stuffs and furs; 2ndly, the species which destroy our\r\ncorn crops; 3rdly, the _phytophagous_ species, that is to say, those\r\nwhich feed on plants.\r\n\r\nIn the first subdivision must be classed the Fur Moth, the Woollen\r\nMoth, and the Hair Moth.\r\n\r\nThe Woollen Moth is represented in the figure on next page. Its\r\ncaterpillar has the form of a worm, and is of a glossy whiteness, with\r\na few hairs thinly sprinkled over it and a grey line on its back. It\r\nis enclosed in a tube, or sheath, open at both ends, in the interior\r\nof which is a sort of tissue of wool, sometimes blue, sometimes\r\ngreen, sometimes red, according to the colour of the stuff to which\r\nthe insect attaches itself and which it despoils. The exterior of this\r\nsheath is, on the contrary, formed of silk made by the insect itself,\r\nof a whitish colour.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are hardly hatched before they begin to clothe\r\nthemselves. Réaumur observed one of these worms during the operation\r\nof enlarging its case. To do this it put its head out of one of the\r\nextremities of its sheath, and looked about eagerly, to the right and\r\nto the left, for those bits of wool which suited it best for weaving\r\nin. In Fig. 294, we see two larvæ occupied in eating a piece of cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293.--The Woollen Moth (_Tinea tapezella_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294.--Larvæ of the Woollen Moth (_Tinea tapezella_).]\r\n\r\n\"The larva changes its place continually and very quickly,\" says\r\nRéaumur. \"If the threads of wool which are near it are not such as it\r\ndesires, it draws sometimes more than half its body out of its case to\r\ngo and look for better ones farther off. If it finds a bit that\r\npleases, the head remains fixed for an instant; it then seizes the\r\nthread with the two mandibles which are below its head, tears the bit\r\nout after redoubled efforts, and immediately carries it to the end of\r\nthe tube against which it attaches it. It repeats many times in\r\nsuccession a similar manoeuvre, sometimes coming partly out of its\r\ntube, and then again re-entering it to fix against one of its sides a\r\nnew piece of wool.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having worked for about a minute at one end of its tube, it\r\nthinks of lengthening the other. It turns itself round in its tube\r\nwith such quickness, that you would imagine it could not have had time\r\nto do so, and would think that its tail was formed in the same way as\r\nits head, and possessed the same address in choosing and tearing out\r\nthe bits of wool.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when the moth which is working at elongating its case\r\ndoes not find the threads or hairs of wool to its taste within reach\r\nof its head, it changes its place. Réaumur saw this insect walking, at\r\nsome speed even, carrying with it its case. It walks on its six front\r\nlegs (Fig. 295). With the middle and hind legs it clings to the\r\ninterior of its case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295.--Larva of a Tinea walking.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the larva becomes longer it becomes stouter.\r\nVery soon its garment will be too narrow for it. Will it enlarge its\r\nold coat, or will it make itself a new one? Réaumur discovered that it\r\npreferred to widen its old coat.\r\n\r\nThat is what our naturalist saw when he placed larvæ with blue cases,\r\nfor instance, upon stuff of a red colour. The bands which extended in\r\nstraight lines from one end of the case to the other, showed the part\r\nthat had been added.\r\n\r\n\"From watching them at different times,\" says this admirable observer,\r\n\"I find that the means which they employ is precisely that to which we\r\nshould have had recourse in a similar case. We know of no other way of\r\nwidening a sheath, a case of any stuff that we find too narrow, than\r\nto split it right up and to let in a piece of the proper size between\r\nthe parts which we have thus divided; we should let in a piece on each\r\nside if the shape of the tube seemed to require it. This is also\r\nexactly what our larvæ do, with an extra, and which with them is a\r\nnecessary, precaution, so as not to remain exposed while they are\r\nworking at the enlargement of their garment. Instead of two pieces,\r\nwhich should each be as long as their case, they let in four, each of\r\nwhich is not longer than half the length of their case; and so they\r\nnever split up more than half the length of the case at the same time,\r\nwhich has enough stuff left in it to keep it together while this\r\nopening is being filled up.\"\r\n\r\nThe wools of our stuffs furnish the moths not only with clothing, but\r\nalso with food. Their excrements are little grains, which are the same\r\ncolour as the wool they have eaten.\r\n\r\nWhen they are full grown, and the time approaches for their\r\nmetamorphosis, the larvæ abandon their food, and establish themselves\r\nin the angles of walls. They creep up to the ceilings and suspend\r\nthemselves to them by one extremity of their tube. The two ends of the\r\ntube are now closed by a silken tissue (Fig. 296). The larva thus\r\nenclosed very soon changes its form; it becomes a chrysalis; then at\r\nthe end of about three weeks it is set free as a moth.\r\n\r\nThe Fur or Skin Moth works like the carpet moth: it makes itself a\r\ncase of the same form, and constructs it in the same manner. Only in\r\nthis case its covering is made of a sort of felt resembling that of\r\nwhich our hats are made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296.--Case of the Moth attached to a piece of cloth.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Carpet Moth only detaches from the various stuffs the wool\r\nit requires for clothing and nourishment, the Fur Moth causes much\r\nmore considerable and more rapid damage. It cuts off all the hairs\r\nwhich are in its way right down to the skin; it seems as if it took a\r\ndelight in cutting them off. That which is necessary for its wants is\r\nnothing in comparison to the great quantity of hair one sees fall off\r\na skin on which it has established itself, when it is shaken. As it\r\nadvances it cuts more thoroughly than a razor could all the hairs\r\nwhich are in its way.\r\n\r\nThe Hair Moth (Fig. 297) shows itself in great numbers in the perfect\r\nstate, from the end of April till the beginning of June. They appear\r\nagain in September, and generally stay behind cabinets and other\r\npieces of furniture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297.--Hair Moth.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, which is cylindrical, white, destitute of hair, and\r\nstriped with brown, lives principally in the hair with which furniture\r\nis stuffed, and sometimes in hair mattresses. When it has reached its\r\nfull size, it abandons its abode, pierces through the stuff which\r\ncovers the hair, and constructs for itself with this stuff a case of\r\nsilk, open only towards the end where the head is. At the beginning of\r\nApril it shuts its case, and changes itself into a chrysalis.\r\n\r\nWe can only here mention some of the phytophagous species, as the\r\nCherry-tree Moth (_Tinea cerasiella_), the Hawthorn Moth (_Tinea\r\ncratægella_), the Burdock Moth (_Tinea lapella_), and the Rustic Moth\r\n(_Tinea rusticella_).\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of the _OEcophoræ_ resemble whitish worms. They\r\nattack the leaves, the blossoms, the bark, and certain parts of the\r\nfruit of trees. Some of these hollow out for themselves galleries in\r\neating the fleshy part; others also make galleries, but only in the\r\ncuticle of the tree, or in the tenderest part of its bark. Some,\r\nagain, shut themselves up in one or many leaves rolled like a trumpet,\r\nwhile others keep at the summits of plants, whose leaves they bind\r\ntogether in a parcel with threads. And, lastly, some devour the stones\r\nof fruits, such as that of the olive.\r\n\r\nThe moths of these caterpillars are very small, and generally of\r\nbrilliant metallic colours, they are to be found in the woods, and\r\nstill more in the orchards, from the beginning of June till the month\r\nof September.\r\n\r\nThe _OEcophoræ_ are very slim and elegantly formed. Their anterior\r\nwings, which are very narrow, are often ornamented with silvery\r\nlongitudinal lines, the posterior wings exactly resembling two\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars live and metamorphose themselves in portable cases,\r\nwhich they manufacture from the membranous portions of leaves, whose\r\nflesh alone they eat. These cases are generally of a brown colour,\r\nresembling a dead leaf. They are attached perpendicularly under the\r\nleaves of many trees, but often under those of fruit trees.\r\n\r\nCertain species of _OEcophoræ_ have cases partly covered with loose\r\npieces only slightly attached, formed of portions of leaves, and\r\narranged in such a way that Réaumur compares them to the furbelows\r\nwhich ladies used formerly to attach to the bottom of their dresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nORTHOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Orthoptera[76] we meet with some of the largest of insects,\r\nand particularly those which are of strange and extraordinary shapes.\r\nThe best known insects of this order are the _Mantes_, Cockroaches,\r\nEarwigs,[77] Locusts, Grasshoppers, Crickets, &c.\r\n\r\n    [76] From [Greek: orthos], straight, and [Greek: pteron], wing,\r\n    on account of the manner in which the under-wings are folded\r\n    under the upper.--ED.\r\n\r\n    [77] Made a separate Order, _Dermaptera_, by Kirby.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe Orthoptera have the anterior wings long, narrow, half-horny. These\r\nare elytra, which serve as cases for their second wings, as is the\r\ncase with the Coleoptera. But the elytra of the Orthoptera are less\r\nsolid and less complete than those of the Coleoptera. Moreover, they\r\ngenerally overlap each other when the insect is at rest, which is\r\nanother distinctive characteristic. The second wings are membranous,\r\nvery broad, and veined; and, when at rest, are folded up like a fan.\r\nThe mouth is composed of free pieces. The mandibles, the jaws, and the\r\ntwo lips, always well developed, show them to be insects which grind\r\ntheir food. Their voracity, and the rapid way in which they multiply,\r\nsometimes make these insects the pest of the country. Above all, they\r\nare to be met with in hot countries, where they cause such great\r\ndamage that all vegetation disappears on their passage. There are not\r\na great variety of species of Orthoptera. They are insects whose\r\nmetamorphoses are incomplete; that is, they undergo only trifling\r\nchanges from the moment when the eggs are hatched to the time when the\r\ninsect is fully developed.\r\n\r\nWhen it leaves the egg, the young one resembles its parents; it\r\ndiffers only in size and in having no wings. After moulting four or\r\nfive times it has almost reached its full growth, and its wings begin\r\nto appear under a sort of membrane. This is the pupa state. A final\r\nmoulting sets free the wings also, and the insect, now perfect,\r\nlaunches itself into the air with its congeners.\r\n\r\nThe Orthoptera are vegetable feeders, and frequently commit great\r\nravages on various crops. They are divided into two groups, viz.,\r\nthose which _run_, and those which _jump_ or _leap_. We will begin\r\nwith those which run, which contains the Earwig (_Forficula_), the\r\nCockroach (_Blatta_), the genus _Mantis_, or Leaf Insects, and the\r\ngenus _Phasma_.\r\n\r\nThe _Forficula_, or Earwig, is represented in Figs. 298, 299, 300, in\r\nits three different states. The lower wings are very broad, and folded\r\nat the same time like a fan, and doubled up. Its abdomen terminates in\r\na sort of pair of pincers, resembling those which the jewellers\r\nformerly used for piercing the ears of young girls as a preparatory\r\nstep to their wearing ear-rings. Hence, without doubt, their French\r\nname of _Perce-oreille_, or ear-piercer; for there is nothing to\r\njustify the vulgar belief that these insects introduce themselves into\r\nthe ear, and bore a hole into its interior, through which they may\r\npenetrate into the brain; in fact, they are very innocent insects, and\r\ndo little harm. They live on vegetable matter, and more especially the\r\ninteriors of certain flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 298, 299, 300.--Common Earwig (_Forficula\r\nauricularia_)--larva, pupa, and imago.]\r\n\r\nThe _Forficulæ_ avoid the light. They are to be found in the chinks of\r\ntrees, under bark, and under stones. The female watches over the eggs\r\nwith maternal solicitude, and carries them away elsewhere when they\r\nare touched. She also protects the larvæ and pupæ till they are strong\r\nenough to dispense with all attention.\r\n\r\nThe _Blattæ_, or Cockroaches, are very destructive insects, as the\r\nname, derived from the Greek word [Greek: Blaptein], to damage,\r\nimplies. They are omnivorous, attacking all sorts of dead substances,\r\nvegetable and animal. Horace reproaches them with devouring stuffs,\r\nlike the moths:--\r\n\r\n  \"Cui stragula vestis,\r\n  Blattarum ac tinearum epulæ,\r\n  Putrescit in arca.\"\r\n\r\nThese disagreeable insects devour our eatables, abounding in kitchens,\r\nin bakers' shops, on board merchant vessels, &c. Their flattened\r\nbodies allow them easily to introduce themselves into the cracks of\r\ncases or barrels; so that, to be safe against their attacks, it is\r\nnecessary, on long voyages, to shut up the goods in zinc-lined boxes,\r\nor cases made of sheet-iron well soldered together.\r\n\r\nChamisso relates that the sailors having opened some barrels which\r\nshould have contained rice and wheat, found them filled with German\r\nCockroaches (_Blatta Germanica_). This transubstantiation was not very\r\nagreeable to the crew! Other naturalists have seen this insect\r\ninvading by millions bottles which had contained oil. The Cockroach is\r\nvery fond also of the blacking on boots, and devours leather and all.\r\nOne pupa sometimes eats the skin cast off by another pupa, but a\r\nCockroach has never been known to attack another with a view to eating\r\nhim afterwards.\r\n\r\nThese Orthoptera have a flat broad body, the thorax very much\r\ndeveloped, the antennæ very long, and the legs thin but strong, which\r\nenable them to run with remarkable quickness. They diffuse around them\r\na sickening odour, which often hangs about objects they have touched.\r\nAristophanes, the Greek comic poet, mentions this peculiarity in his\r\ncomedy of \"The Peace.\" They come out mostly at night, and hide\r\nthemselves during the day. They are the most cosmopolitan of all\r\ninsects. Carried over in ships, they perpetuate everywhere, just like\r\nweeds! Persian powder, composed of pulverised _pyrethra_, is an\r\nexcellent means to employ for their destruction.\r\n\r\nMost of the species of cockroaches are black or brownish. Two among\r\nthem, the _Blatta Germanica_ and the _Blatta Laponica_, which are to\r\nbe met with in the woods round about Paris, have domesticated\r\nthemselves in dwellings of the northern countries. They are a quarter\r\nof an inch in length. The Russians pretend that the former was\r\nimported from Prussia by their army, on its return from Germany, after\r\nthe Seven Years' War (1756-1762). Till this period it was unknown at\r\nSt. Petersburg, where now-a-days it is met with in great numbers. It\r\nlives in houses, and eats pretty nearly everything, but prefers white\r\nbread to flour and meat. The _Blatta Laponica_ devours the smoked fish\r\nprepared for the winter.\r\n\r\nThe German naturalist, Hummel, made some interesting observations on\r\nthe development and habits of the very prolific _Blatta Germanica_. It\r\nlays its eggs in a silky capsule, which is in the form of a bean, with\r\ntwo valves in the interior. This is drawn about for some time appended\r\nto the extremity of the abdomen, and after a time abandoned.\r\n\r\nHummel placed under a bell-glass a female cockroach and a perfect\r\negg-pouch, which had only just been abandoned by another female. He\r\nsaw the cockroach approach the bag, feel it, and turn it about in all\r\ndirections. She then took it between her front legs, and made a\r\nlongitudinal opening in it. As the opening grew wider, little white\r\nlarvæ were seen to come from it rolled up and attached together. The\r\nfemale presided at this operation. She assisted the larvæ to set\r\nthemselves free, aiding them out gently with her antennæ. In a few\r\nseconds they were able to walk, when she ceased to trouble herself\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ change their skin six times before reaching the perfect\r\nstate. When they come out of their skin they are colourless, but the\r\ncolour comes in a few minutes. At the fifth moult, which takes place\r\nthree months after birth, they become pupæ, with rudimentary wings,\r\nthe whole shape of the insect being well marked. The sixth, or last\r\nmoult, takes place at the end of six weeks. The pupa is now changed\r\ninto a perfect insect. The female is distinguished from the male by\r\nthe greater size of her abdomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301.--The Cockroach (_Blatta orientalis_).]\r\n\r\nThe most destructive of the _Blattæ_, or Cockroaches, are those which\r\nhave been imported into Europe by the ships coming from the colonies.\r\nThe _Kakerlac Americana_ is from an inch to an inch and a quarter\r\nlong. It infests ships, running about at night over the sleeping\r\npassengers, and devouring the food. They are to be met with in all\r\nparts of the world. They abound particularly in the warm parts of\r\nAmerica. The _Blatta orientalis_ is more commonly met with than the\r\nabove. It swarms in kitchens, in bakers' shops, provision shops, &c.,\r\nwhere it hides in the cracks of the walls, or against the hinges of\r\nthe doors. It is a small hideous animal, of a repulsive smell, and of\r\na reddish brown colour. It is a little larger than the _Blatta\r\nAmericana_. In France it is called by various names, such as _Cafard_,\r\n_Panetière_, _Noirot_, _Bête noir_, &c. If in the middle of the night\r\nyou suddenly enter with a light into the down-stairs kitchens, you\r\nwill often see these little beasts running about on the table, and\r\ndevouring the remains of the food with astonishing rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe largest species of the genus of which we are now treating is the\r\n_Kakerlac insignis_, which inhabits Cayenne and Brazil, and in length\r\nsometimes exceeds an inch and three-quarters, and in the extent of its\r\nwings four inches and a half.\r\n\r\nIt is principally in hot countries that the cockroaches do the\r\ngreatest damage. In the Antilles, of which they are the pest, it is\r\naffirmed that in one single night they can bore holes through trunks,\r\nthrough cases, and through bags, and destroy objects which were\r\nsupposed to be in perfect safety. Sometimes the walls, the floors, the\r\nbeds, the tables, everything, in short, is infested by them, and it is\r\nimpossible to find a way of preserving the food from their repulsive\r\ntouch. One can, however, partially succeed in destroying them by the\r\naid of insect powders. They have, however, natural enemies. Poultry\r\nand owls are very fond of them. A species of wasp, _Chlorion\r\ncompressum_, lays up a stock of cockroaches, which it previously\r\nrenders insensible, for its larvæ. Many species of _Chalcidiæ_, a\r\nfamily of Hymenoptera, also live on the eggs of these Orthoptera.\r\nThere are also among the cockroaches certain brightly-coloured exotic\r\nspecies. These colours show that they do not avoid the light. We will\r\nmention as examples the _Brachycola robusta_ and the species of\r\n_Corydia_.\r\n\r\nThe _Mantidæ_ are pretty insects, of very different habits from the\r\npreceding. They alone of the Orthoptera are carnivorous. They eat live\r\ninsects, seizing their prey as it passes by them. They rest generally\r\non shrubs, remaining for hours together perfectly motionless, the\r\nbetter to deceive other insects which are to become their victims.\r\n\r\nIt is this fixed and as it were meditative attitude which has gained\r\nfor them the name of _Mantis_, derived from the Greek word [Greek:\r\nmantis], or \"diviner,\" as it was imagined that in this attitude they\r\ninterrogated the future. The manner in which they hold their long\r\nfront legs, raised like arms to Heaven, has also contributed to make\r\nthis superstitious notion believed, and sufficiently explains the\r\nnames given to divers species of _Mantidæ_; such as Nun, Saint,\r\nPreacher, Suppliant, Mendicant, &c. Caillaud, a traveller, tells us\r\nthat in Central Africa a _Mantis_ is an object of worship. According\r\nto Sparmann, another species is worshipped by the Hottentots. If by\r\nchance a _Mantis_ should settle on a person, this person is considered\r\nby them to have received a particular favour from heaven, and from\r\nthat moment takes rank among the saints!\r\n\r\nIn France the country people believe that these insects point out the\r\nway to travellers. Mouffet, a naturalist of the seventeenth century,\r\nsays on this subject, in a description of the _Mantis_:--\"This little\r\ncreature is considered of so divine a nature, that to a child who asks\r\nit its way, it points it out by stretching out one of its legs, and\r\nrarely or never makes a mistake.\"\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the Languedoc peasants the _Mantis religiosa_ is almost\r\nsacred. They call it _Prega-Diou_ (_Prie-Dieu_), and believe firmly\r\nthat it performs its devotions--its attitude, when it is on the watch\r\nfor its prey, resembling that of prayer. Settled on the ground, it\r\nraises its head and thorax, clasps together the joints of its front\r\nlegs, and remains thus motionless for hours together. But only let an\r\nimprudent fly come within reach of our devotee, and you will see it\r\nstealthily approach it, like a cat who is watching a mouse, and with\r\nso much precaution that you can scarcely see that it is moving. Then,\r\nall of a sudden, as quick as lightning, it seizes its victim between\r\nits legs, provided with sharp spines, which cross each other, conveys\r\nit to its mouth, and devours it. Our make-believe Nun, Preacher, our\r\n_Prega-Diou_, is nothing better than a patient watcher and pitiless\r\ndestroyer. The _Mantis religiosa_ (Fig. 302), common enough in the\r\nsouth of France, comes as far north as the environs of Fontainebleau.\r\nThe _Mantis oratoria_, rather smaller, is less commonly met with.\r\n\r\nThese elegant insects are remarkable for their long slim bodies, their\r\nlarge wings, and their colours, which are generally very bright. In\r\nsome species their green or yellowish elytra look so exactly like the\r\nleaves of trees that one can hardly help taking them for such.\r\n\r\nThe _Mantis_ lays its eggs at the end of summer, in rounded, very\r\nfragile shells, attached to the branches of trees; they do not hatch\r\ntill the following summer. The larvæ undergo several successive\r\nmoultings. Nothing equals the ferocity of these Orthoptera. If two of\r\nthem are shut up together, they engage in a desperate combat; they\r\ndeal each other blows with their front legs, and do not leave off\r\nfencing until the stronger of the two has succeeded in eating off the\r\nother's head. From their very birth, the larvæ attack each other. The\r\nmale being smaller than the female, is often its victim.\r\n\r\nKirby tells us that in China the children procure them as in France\r\nthey do cockchafers, and shut them up in bamboo cages, to enjoy the\r\nexciting spectacle of their combats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302.--Mantis religiosa and its larva (A).\r\nBlepharis mendica and its larva (B).]\r\n\r\n_Acanthops_, a genus of this family, inhabits the Brazils.\r\n\r\nAkin to the _Mantis_ are the _Eremiaphilæ_, which live in the deserts\r\nof Africa and Arabia. They drag themselves gently along on the ground,\r\nand as they are the same colour as the sand on which they are found,\r\nit is very difficult to distinguish them when at rest. The traveller,\r\nLefebvre, relates that he always found these Orthoptera in places\r\ndestitute of all vegetation, and where there were no other sorts of\r\ninsects which could have served them for food; it is therefore\r\nprobable that they live on microscopic insects.\r\n\r\nThe _Empusa_, which forms another genus of _Mantidæ_, has the antennæ\r\nindented like a comb in the males, thread-like in the females. The\r\n_Empusa gongylodes_, which inhabits Africa, has cuffs to its arms and\r\nflounces to its robe.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Blepharis_, to which belongs the _Blepharis mendica_, is\r\nmet with in Egypt, Arabia, and in the Canary Islands. This insect,\r\nwhich is of a pale green, is not rare in the south of France. It is\r\nrepresented with the _Mantis religiosa_ in Fig. 302.\r\n\r\nThe _Phasmata_, or Spectres, are distinguished from the _Mantidæ_ by\r\ntheir very elongated bodies, straight and stiff as a stick, by their\r\nhaving no prehensile legs, and by their food, which is exclusively\r\nvegetable. Their eggs are laid uncovered, having no silky envelope. As\r\nfor the habits of these insects, they are little known, the greatest\r\nnumber of the species being exotics, inhabiting chiefly South America,\r\nAsia, Africa, and New Holland. It is in this tribe that we meet the\r\nmost extraordinary and the most monstrously shaped insects, as the\r\npopular names they have received in different countries show: such as\r\nSpectres, Phantoms, Devil's Horses, Soldiers of Cayenne, Walking\r\nLeaves, Animated Sticks, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong the Phasmæ we also find the largest insects known, for they\r\nattain a considerable length, _Phasma gigas_ nearly reaching a foot.\r\nThe most beautiful are those of New Holland and of Tasmania, such as\r\n_Cyphocrana (Phasma) gigas_.\r\n\r\nSome species are destitute of wings, and resemble so exactly dry\r\nsticks that it is impossible to tell the difference. The best known is\r\nthe _Bacillus (Phasma) Rossia_ (Fig. 303), which is found in the south\r\nof France. This inoffensive insect walks gently along the branches of\r\ntrees, and likes to repose in the sun, its long antennæ-like legs\r\nstretched out in front. Others of the genus _Phyllium_ are provided\r\nwith wings, and have altogether the appearance of the leaves on which\r\nthey live; such are the Walking Leaves of the East Indies. According\r\nto Cunningham, all these insects are of solitary and peaceable habits.\r\nThey are only to be met with alone or in pairs, drawing themselves\r\ngently along on shrubs, on which they pass the hottest months of the\r\nyear. Some of them, when they are seized, emit a milky liquid of a\r\nvery strong and disagreeable odour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303.--Phasma Rossia--male, female, and larva.]\r\n\r\nThose Orthoptera which we have already mentioned had all their six\r\nlegs adapted to running, and are called _Cursoria_. Those which jump,\r\nto which we now come, have their hind-legs stronger and thicker, which\r\nenables them to leap, and are on that account called _Saltatoria_.\r\nThis section comprises three families, which have for their principal\r\ntypes the Crickets, Locusts, and Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nAll these insects resemble each other in the disproportion which\r\nexists between their hind-legs and the other pairs. Another\r\ncharacteristic which is common to them consists in the song of the\r\nmales. This song, so well known, which seems to have for its object to\r\ncall the females, is nothing but a sort of stridulation or screeching,\r\nproduced by the rubbing together of the wing cases, or elytra. But the\r\nmechanism by which this is produced varies a little in all the three\r\nkinds. With the Crickets the whole surface of the wing cases is\r\ncovered with thick nervures, very prominent and very hard, which cause\r\nthe noise the insect produces in rubbing the elytra one against the\r\nother. With the Locusts, there exists only at the base of the elytra a\r\ntransparent membrane called the mirror, which is furnished with\r\nprominent nervures, and produces the screeching noise. And, lastly, in\r\nthe Crickets the thighs and elytra are provided with very hard ridges.\r\nThe thighs, being passed rapidly and with force over the nervures of\r\nthe elytra, produce the sound, in the same way as a fiddle-bow when\r\ndrawn across the strings of a violin. In all these insects the male\r\nalone is endowed with the faculty of producing sound.\r\n\r\nThe Crickets and Grasshoppers have very long and thin antennæ, whilst\r\nthe Locusts have short antennæ, and either flattened or filiform, or\r\nswelling out at one extremity like a club. The female of the first two\r\nis provided with an ovipositor in the shape of an auger.\r\n\r\nWe will study successfully the three types of these families, that is\r\nto say, the Crickets, the Locusts, and the Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nThe Field Cricket (_Gryllus campestris_, Fig. 304) lives alone in a\r\nhole which it digs in the ground, and in which it remains during the\r\nday. It only quits its retreat at night, when it goes in search of\r\nfood. It is very timid, and at the least noise ceases its song. If it\r\nis stationed on the side of its hole, it retreats into it the moment\r\nany one approaches.\r\n\r\nThe holes of the crickets are well known to country children, who take\r\nthese insects by presenting a straw to them. The pugnacious cricket\r\nseizes it directly with its mandibles, and lets itself be drawn out of\r\nits hole. It is this which has given rise to the saying, \"_plus sot\r\nqu'un grillon_\" (a greater fool than a cricket). It is very\r\nsusceptible of cold, and always makes the opening of its hole towards\r\nthe south. It lives on herbs, perhaps also on insects.\r\n\r\nThe House Cricket is about half an inch long, of an ashy colour, and\r\nis to be met with principally in bakers' shops and country kitchens,\r\nwhere it hides itself during the day in the crevices of the walls or\r\nat the back of the fireplaces. It eats flour, and also, perhaps, the\r\nlittle insects which live in flour.\r\n\r\nIf crickets are put into a box together, they devour each other. This\r\ndoes not prove conclusively that they are carnivorous, for there are\r\nmany species, eating nothing but vegetables, which would destroy each\r\nother in a similar case. Some authors say that these insects are\r\nalways thirsty, for they are often to be found drowned in the vessels\r\ncontaining any kind of liquid. Everything damp is to their taste. It\r\nis for this reason that they sometimes make holes in wet clothes,\r\nwhich are hung up before the fire to dry. They inhabit, by preference,\r\nhouses newly built; for the mortar, being still damp, allows them to\r\nhollow out their dwelling-places with greater ease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304.--Field Cricket (_Gryllus campestris_).]\r\n\r\nThe habits of the House Cricket (_Gryllus domesticus_) are nocturnal,\r\nlike those of its congener of the fields. It is only at night that it\r\nleaves its retreat to seek its food. When it is exposed against its\r\nwill to the light of day, it appears to be in a state of torpor. This\r\ninsect reminds one of the owl, among birds, not only from its habit of\r\navoiding the light, but also from its monotonous song, which the\r\nvulgar consider, one does not know why, a foreboding of ill-luck to\r\nthe house in which it is heard. Formerly this singular prejudice was\r\nmuch deeper rooted than it is at present The song of the cricket has\r\nmerely the object of calling the female. The Wood Cricket (_Gryllus_\r\n[_Nemobius_] _sylvestris_) is much smaller than the above, and is met\r\nwith in great numbers in the woods, where its leaps sometimes produce\r\nthe noise of drops of rain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305.--Mole Cricket (_Gryllo-talpa vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nThe female crickets have a long egg-layer, or ovipositor, with which\r\nthey deposit their eggs, of which each one lays, towards the middle of\r\nthe summer, about three hundred, in the cracks and crevices of the\r\nsoil. The larvæ pass the winter in that state, and do not become pupæ\r\nand perfect insects till the following summer.\r\n\r\nMouffet relates that, in certain regions of Africa, the crickets are\r\nobjects of commerce. They are brought up in little cages, as we do\r\nCanary birds, and sold to the inhabitants, who like to hear their\r\namorous chant. It is said that some tribes eat these insects. In\r\nFrance they are sought after as baits for fishing, and are used also\r\nin menageries for feeding small reptiles. Next to _Gryllus_ come the\r\ngenera _OEcanthus_, insects of the south of Europe, which live on\r\nplants, and which one often sees fluttering about flowers; _Sphæria_,\r\nwhich live in ant-hills; _Platydactylus_; and, lastly, the Mole\r\nCricket (_Gryllo-talpa_), whose habits deserve attention for a while.\r\n\r\nThe Mole Crickets are distinguished from all other insects by the\r\nstructure of their fore-legs, which are wide and indented, in such a\r\nmanner as to resemble a hand, analogous to that of the mole. This leg\r\nbetrays the habits of the cricket much better than our hands betray\r\nours. They make use of them, indeed, as spades, with which they hollow\r\nout subterranean galleries, and accumulate at the side of the\r\nentrance-hole the rubbish thus drawn out. The French name comes from\r\nthe old French word _courtille_, which means garden. Such places and\r\nvineyards are the favourite haunts of these destructive insects.\r\n\r\nIf the Mole Crickets, or _Courtilières_, have spades on their front\r\nlegs, their hind-legs are very little developed, so that it would be\r\nperfectly impossible for them to jump, particularly as their large\r\nabdomen would hinder their so doing. The wings are broad, and fold\r\nback in the form of a fan; they make little use of them, and it is\r\nonly at night-fall that the mole cricket is seen to disport himself,\r\ndescribing curves of no great height in the air. It is found\r\nprincipally in cultivated land, kitchen-gardens, nursery gardens,\r\nwheat fields, &c., where it scoops out for itself an oval cavity\r\ncommunicating with the surface by a vertical hole (Fig. 306). On this\r\nhole abut numerous horizontal galleries, more or less inclined, which\r\npermit the insect to gain its retreat by a great many roads, when\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that an insect which undermines land in this\r\nway must cause great damage to cultivation. Whether the crops serve it\r\nfor food or not, they are not the less destroyed by its underground\r\nburrowings. Lands infested by the mole cricket are recognisable by the\r\ncolour of the vegetation, which is yellow and withered; and the\r\nrubbish which these miners heap up at the side of the openings leading\r\nto their galleries, resembling mole-hills in miniature, betray their\r\npresence to the farmer. To destroy them, they pour water or other\r\nliquids into their nests, or else they bury, at different distances,\r\nvessels filled with water, in which they drown themselves. From the\r\nmonth of April the males betake themselves to the entrance of their\r\nburrows, and make their cry of appeal. Their notes are slow,\r\nvibrating, and monotonous, and repeated for a long time without\r\ninterruption, and somewhat resembling the cry of the owl or the\r\ngoat-sucker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306.--The nest of the Mole Cricket (_Gryllo-talpa\r\nvulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nThe female lays her eggs, to the number of from two to three hundred,\r\nin the interior of a sort of chamber scooped out in soil stiff enough\r\nto resist the action of rain. The hatching takes place at the end of a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIt is not till the following spring that the larvæ pass into the pupa\r\nstate, and that the organs of flight begin to be marked out. According\r\nto M. Féburier, three years are required for the complete development\r\nof the mole cricket, which is a fact that indicates remarkable\r\nlongevity in these insects. All authors agree, moreover, in extolling\r\nthe solicitude with which the mole cricket takes care of her little\r\nones. She watches over them, and, they say, procures them food.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Tridactylus_, which bears a great analogy to the mole\r\ncricket, is the smallest genus of Orthoptera known; the species are\r\nnot more than a sixth of an inch in length, and are found in the south\r\nof France, on the banks of the Rhône and other rivers, where they\r\ndisport themselves in sand exposed to the sun. The _Tridactyli_ leap\r\nwith remarkable agility, even on the surface of the water, for their\r\nlegs are provided with flat appendages much resembling battledores.\r\n\r\nThe Grasshoppers and Locusts take much longer leaps than the Crickets,\r\nowing to the conformation of their hind-legs, and they often make use\r\nof their wings also, which are very fully developed. These insects are\r\nunable to walk, on account of the disproportion which exists between\r\ntheir different pairs of legs. The female is provided with a curved\r\novipositor with two valves, which serves for breaking up the ground\r\nfor the reception of its eggs. The male produces a sharp stridulation\r\nor screeching sound, by rubbing the cases of its wings--which are\r\nfurnished with plates which might be compared to cymbals--one against\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe song of the grasshopper, known by everyone, is a monotonous\r\n\"zic-zic-zic,\" which can be heard during the day in grassy places. It\r\nis on account of this song that the name of Cigale is sometimes given,\r\nthough wrongly, to the great green grasshopper. As we have already\r\nsaid in speaking of the Cigale, it is the green grasshopper which La\r\nFontaine had in view in his fable of _La Cigale et la Fourmi_, for all\r\nthe plates which ornament the ancient editions of the fables of this\r\nauthor represent a grasshopper, and not a Cigale. Grasshoppers are\r\nspread over the whole surface of the earth, but are to be met with\r\nchiefly in South America, which contains nearly three-fourths of the\r\nspecies known. The European species, on the contrary, are few.\r\n\r\nTheir habits resemble those of the other herbivorous Orthoptera. They\r\nlive in meadows, on trees, devouring the leaves and stalks of plants;\r\nbut they are never found in such great numbers as to cause damage at\r\nall to be compared to that caused by the locust. They appear in the\r\nmonth of July and disappear at the beginning of the cold weather.\r\nTowards the end of summer their song is heard in the meadows and wheat\r\nfields. The females, summoned by the males, are not long in coupling\r\nand laying their eggs, which do not hatch until the following spring,\r\nin the ground. After four months the larvæ change into pupæ, which\r\nalready show rudimentary wings, and which by a fifth month pass into\r\nthe perfect state.\r\n\r\nThe Great Green Grasshopper (_Locusta viridissima_) is very common in\r\nEurope. It remains during the day on trees, and in the evening\r\ndisports itself in the fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307.--Decticus verrucivorus.]\r\n\r\nThe _Decticus verrucivorus_ (Fig. 307) is a shorter and more thick-set\r\nspecies, whose distinctive feature is a very broad head. Its colour is\r\ngrey of various shades, and it is to be heard singing during the day\r\nin fields of ripe wheat. The name comes from the use made of it by the\r\npeasants in Sweden and Germany as a cure for warts.\r\n\r\n\"The peasants,\" says Charles de Geer, \"make these locusts bite the\r\nwarts which they often have on their hands, and the liquid which at\r\nthe same time flows from the insect's mouth into the wound causes the\r\nwarts to dry up and disappear. It is for this reason they have given\r\nthem the name of Wart-bit or Wart-biter.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Phaneropteræ_ and the _Copiphores_ are exotic Locusts. The\r\n_Ephippigeræ_ are small species whose thorax, which is very convex,\r\nresembles a saddle.\r\n\r\nOne often meets in the environs of Paris the Vine Ephippiger\r\n(_Ephippigera vitium_), which is greenish, with four brown stripes on\r\nits head. In this species the wing cases, or elytra, are almost\r\nobsolete, and the wings are reduced to mere arched scales, whose\r\nfriction produces a stridulation or screeching noise. The females are\r\nprovided with a similar apparatus, so that they perform duets.[78]\r\n\r\n    [78] The species of genus _Saga_ sometimes reach extraordinary\r\n    dimensions. Thus, in 1863, there was found in Syria, after a\r\n    shower of ordinary locusts, a specimen of the _Saga_ which was\r\n    three inches and a quarter long. It was presented to the Museum\r\n    of Natural History of Paris, by M. L. Delair.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Gryllacris_ resembles the crickets. It contains the\r\n_Anostostomæ_ of New Holland, which are said to be destitute of wings,\r\neven in the perfect state.\r\n\r\nWe arrive now at the redoubtable tribe of _Acridium_, or Locust, whose\r\nfearful ravages are so well known.\r\n\r\nThese are, among the Orthoptera, the best adapted for jumping. The\r\nthigh and the leg, folded together when at rest, are stretched out\r\nsuddenly under the action of very powerful muscles. The body, resting\r\nthen on the tarsi and on the flexible spines of the legs, is shot into\r\nthe air to a great height. They fly very well, but the power of\r\nwalking and running is denied to them, as it is also to the other\r\n_Saltatoriæ_. The females have no ovipositor. This peculiarity, and\r\nthe formation of their antennæ, which are very short, distinguish the\r\nlocusts from the grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nThe males, as we have already said, make a shrill stridulation by\r\nrubbing their thighs over their elytra. There is never more than one\r\nthigh in motion at a time; the insect using the right and the left by\r\nturns. The sound is made stronger by a sort of drum filled with air,\r\nand covered with a very thin skin, which is found on each side of the\r\nbody, at the base of the abdomen. The locust's song is less monotonous\r\nthan that of the grasshopper. It is capable of much variation; it is a\r\nnoise just like that of a rattle, but with sounds which vary very\r\nmuch, according to the species.\r\n\r\nThey move about by day, frequent dry places, and are very fond of\r\nsitting on the grass in the sun. Certain species, which inhabit the\r\nwarm regions of the south, move their legs with scarcely any noise; it\r\nbeing only perceptible to a very fine ear.\r\n\r\nLocusts are very abundant in many parts of the world. In northern\r\ncountries, where they multiply less rapidly, their ravages are less\r\ndisastrous, though still very considerable. But in the southern\r\nportions of the globe they are a perfect pest--the eighth plague of\r\nEgypt. Certain species multiply in such a prodigious manner, that they\r\nlay waste vast spaces of land, and in a very short time reduce whole\r\ncountries to the very last state of misery. These insects inflate\r\nthemselves with air, and undertake journeys during which they travel\r\nmore than six leagues a day, laying waste all vegetation on their\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308.--Locust (_Acridium_ [_OEdipoda_]\r\n_migratorium_).]\r\n\r\nThe most destructive species is the Migratory Locust (_Acridium_ [or\r\n_OEdipoda_] _migratorium_, Fig. 308), which is very common in\r\nAfrica, India, and throughout the whole of the East. Isolated\r\nspecimens of this insect are to be found in the meadows round about\r\nParis, especially towards the end of the summer, and, very rarely, in\r\nEngland. This species is greenish, with transparent elytra of a dirty\r\ngrey, whitish wings, and pink legs. A second species, the Italian\r\nlocust, also does a great deal of damage in the south. All the species\r\nundergo five moults, which take six weeks each. The last takes place\r\nat the end of the hot weather, towards the autumn.\r\n\r\nIt is especially in warm climates that they become such fearful pests\r\nto agriculture. Wherever they alight, they change the most fertile\r\ncountry into an arid desert. They are seen coming in innumerable\r\nbands, which, from afar, have the appearance of stormy clouds, even\r\nhiding the sun. As far and as wide as the eye can reach the sky is\r\nblack, and the soil is inundated with them. The noise of these\r\nmillions of wings may be compared to the sound of a cataract. When\r\nthis fearful army alights upon the ground, the branches of the trees\r\nbreak, and in a few hours, and over an extent of many leagues, all\r\nvegetation has disappeared, the wheat is gnawed to its very roots, the\r\ntrees are stripped of their leaves. Everything has been destroyed,\r\ngnawed down, and devoured. When nothing more is left, the terrible\r\nhost rises, as if in obedience to some given signal, and takes its\r\ndeparture, leaving behind it despair and famine. It goes to look for\r\nfresh food--seeking whom, or rather in this case, what it may devour!\r\n(PLATE VIII.)\r\n\r\nDuring the year succeeding that in which a country has been devastated\r\nby showers of locusts, damage from these insects is the less to be\r\nfeared; for it happens often that after having ravaged everything,\r\nthey die of hunger before the laying season begins. But their death\r\nbecomes the cause of a greater evil. Their innumerable carcases, lying\r\nin heaps and heated by the sun, are not long in entering into a state\r\nof putrefaction; epidemic disease, caused by the poisonous gases\r\nemanating from them, soon break out, and decimate the populations.\r\nThese locusts are bred in the deserts of Arabia and Tartary, and the\r\neast winds carry them into Africa and Europe. Ships in the eastern\r\nparts of the Mediterranean are sometimes covered with them at a great\r\ndistance from the land.\r\n\r\nIt is related in the Bible, in the tenth chapter of Exodus, that\r\nJehovah commanded Moses to stretch forth his hand to make locusts\r\n(Arbeth) come over the whole land of Egypt as the eighth plague,\r\ndestined to intimidate Pharaoh, who had rebelled against Him. These\r\ninsects arrived, brought by an east wind, and covered the surface of\r\nthe country to such a degree that the air was darkened by them.[79]\r\n\r\n    [79] \"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,\r\n    and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day,\r\n    and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind\r\n    brought the locusts. And the locusts went up over all the land\r\n    of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous\r\n    were they; before them there were no such locusts as they,\r\n    neither after them shall be such. For they covered the face of\r\n    the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did\r\n    eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees\r\n    which the hail had left; and there remained not any green thing\r\n    in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the\r\n    land of Egypt.\"--EXOD. x. 13-15.\r\n\r\nThey ate up all the herbs of the field and all the fruit of the trees\r\nwhich the hail (the seventh plague) had left. A west wind swept\r\nthem away again, when Pharaoh had at last promised to allow the\r\nchildren of Israel to depart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIII. A Cloud of Locusts in Algeria.]\r\n\r\nPliny relates that in many places in Greece a law obliged the\r\ninhabitants to wage war against the locusts three times a year; that\r\nis to say, in their three states of egg, larva, and adult. In the Isle\r\nof Lemnos the citizens had to pay as taxes so many measures of\r\nlocusts. In the year 170 before our era they devastated the environs\r\nof Capua. In the year of our Lord 181 they committed great ravages in\r\nthe north of Italy and in Gaul. In 1690 locusts arrived in Poland and\r\nLithuania by three different ways, and, as it were, in three different\r\nbodies. \"They were to be found in certain places where they had died,\"\r\nwrites the Abbé Ussaris, an eye-witness, \"lying on one another in\r\nheaps of four feet in height. Those which were alive, perched upon the\r\ntrees, bending their branches to the ground, so great was their\r\nnumber. The people thought that they had Hebrew letters on their\r\nwings. A rabbi professed to be able to read on them words which\r\nsignified God's wrath. The rains killed these insects: they infected\r\nthe air; and the cattle, which ate them in the grass, died\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1749 locusts stopped the army of Charles XII., King of Sweden, as\r\nit was retreating from Bessarabia, on its defeat at Pultowa. The king\r\nthought that he was assailed by a hail-storm, when a host of these\r\ninsects beat violently against his army as it was passing through a\r\ndefile, so that men and horses were blinded by this living hail,\r\nfalling from a cloud which hid the sun. The arrival of the locusts had\r\nbeen announced by a whistling sound like that which precedes a\r\ntempest; and the noise of their flight quite over-powered the noise\r\nmade by the Black Sea. All the country round about was soon laid waste\r\non their route. During the same year a great part of Europe was\r\ninvaded by these pests, the newspapers of the day being full of\r\naccounts relating to this public calamity. In 1753 Portugal was\r\nattacked by them. This was the year of the earthquake of Lisbon, and\r\nall sorts of plagues seemed at this time to rage in that unfortunate\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, in Transylvania, their ravages assumed such gigantic\r\nproportions that it was found necessary to call in the assistance of\r\nthe army. Regiments of soldiers gathered them together and enclosed\r\nthem in sacks. Fifteen hundred persons were employed in crushing,\r\nburying, and burning them; but, in spite of all this, their number did\r\nnot seem to diminish; but a cold wind, which fortunately sprang up,\r\ncaused them to disappear. In the following spring the plague broke out\r\nagain, and every one turned out to fight against it. The locusts were\r\nswept with great brooms into ditches, in which they were then burnt;\r\nnot, however, before they had ruined the whole country. Locusts showed\r\nthemselves at the same time in the empire of Morocco, where they\r\ncaused a fearful famine. The poor were to be seen wandering on all\r\nsides, digging up the roots of vegetables, and eagerly devouring\r\ncamels' dung, in hopes of finding in it a few undigested grains of\r\nbarley.\r\n\r\nBarrow and Levaillant, in their travels through Central Africa, speak\r\nof similar calamities having happened many times between 1784 and\r\n1797. They add that the surface of the rivers was then hidden by the\r\nbodies of the locusts, which covered the whole country.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jackson, in 1739 they covered the whole surface of the\r\nground from Tangiers to Mogador. All the region near to the Sahara was\r\nravaged, whilst on the other side of the river El Klos there was not\r\none of these insects. When the wind blew they were driven into the\r\nsea, and their carcases occasioned a plague which laid Barbary waste.\r\n\r\nIndia and China often suffer from these destructive insects. In 1735\r\nclouds of locusts hid from the Chinese both the sun and moon. Not only\r\nthe standing crops, but also the corn in the barns and the clothes in\r\nthe houses were devoured.\r\n\r\nIn the south of France locusts multiply sometimes so prodigiously that\r\nin a very short time many barrels may be filled with their eggs. They\r\nhave caused, at different periods, immense damage. It was chiefly in\r\nthe years 1613, 1805, 1820, 1822, 1824, 1825, 1832, and 1834, that\r\ntheir visits to the south of France were most formidable.\r\n\r\nMézeray relates that in the month of January, 1613, in the reign of\r\nLouis XIII., locusts invaded the country around Arles. In seven or\r\neight hours the wheat and crops were devoured to the roots over an\r\nextent of country of 15,000 acres. They then crossed over the Rhine,\r\nand visited Tarascon and Beaucaire, where they ate the vegetables and\r\nlucerne. They then shifted their quarters to Aramon, to Monfrin, to\r\nValabregues, &c., where they were fortunately destroyed in great part\r\nby the starlings and other insect-eating birds, which flocked in\r\ninnumerable numbers to this game.\r\n\r\nThe consuls of Arles and of Marseilles caused the eggs to be\r\ncollected. Arles spent, for this object, 25,000 francs, and Marseilles\r\n20,000 francs. Three thousand quintals of eggs were interred or thrown\r\ninto the Rhône. If we count 1,750,000 eggs per quintal, that will give\r\nus a total of 5,250,000,000 of locusts destroyed in the egg, which\r\notherwise would have very soon renewed the ravages of which the\r\ncountry had so lately been the victim. In 1822 were spent again, in\r\nProvence, 2,227 francs for the same object. In 1825 were spent 6,200\r\nfrancs. A reward of 50 centimes was given for every kilogramme of\r\neggs, and half the sum for every kilogramme of insects. The eggs\r\ncollected were burnt, or else crushed under heavy rollers. The\r\ngathering was entrusted to women and children. The operation consisted\r\nin dragging along the ground great sheets, the corners of which were\r\nheld up. The locusts came and settled on these, and were caught by\r\nrolling the sheet up.\r\n\r\nIn the territory of Saintes-Maries, situated not far from\r\nAigues-Mortes, on the Mediterranean coast, 1,518 wheat sacks were\r\nfilled with dead locusts, amounting in weight to 68,861 kilogrammes;\r\nand at Aries 165 sacks, or 6,600 kilogrammes. The rewards given\r\namounted to 5,542 francs; but, notwithstanding all this, the following\r\nyear the locusts caused still greater damage.\r\n\r\nLocusts are always to be found in Algeria, in the provinces of Oran,\r\nBona, Algiers, and Bougia, but they never commit those terrible\r\nravages which change cultivated countries into deserts. There are in\r\nAlgeria years of locusts as there are with us years of cockroaches, of\r\nblight, of caterpillars, &c. These plagues are fortunately rare. The\r\nmost terrible took place in 1845 and in 1866. In the former year a\r\nformidable invasion of locusts took place. It lasted five months, from\r\nMarch to July, each day bringing new bands of these devastating\r\ninsects; and M. Henry Berthoud, then in Algeria, saw a column of them,\r\nwhose passage began before daylight, and had scarcely ended at four\r\no'clock in the afternoon. Dr. Guyon, doctor to the army, and\r\ncorrespondent of the Institute, addressed to this learned body an\r\naccount of a few peculiarities of this invasion, of which he was a\r\nwitness. He speaks of a band which passed on the 16th of March over\r\nthe plain of Sebdon, going in the direction of the desert of Angard.\r\nTheir passage lasted three hours. The locusts, having found nothing to\r\ndevour in the desert, came back again, and next day made a descent\r\nupon the plain of Sebdon, which is 30 kilomètres long, by 12 to 15\r\nkilomètres broad. In four hours all the crops were devoured, and all\r\nvegetation destroyed. \"The locusts,\" says the Doctor, \"left behind\r\nthem an infectious odour of putrid herbs, produced by their\r\nexcretions.\"\r\n\r\nAt Algiers, in the Faubourg Bab-Azoum, they penetrated in masses into\r\nthe barley stores, and there was the greatest difficulty in driving\r\nthem away, great barricades being raised before the storerooms to stop\r\nthe invasion. In 1845 they penetrated into the pits in which the\r\nnatives preserve their wheat. According to the report of the\r\nCommandant de la Place of Philippeville, M. Levaillant, a column of\r\nlocusts alighted in the country round about that town on the 18th of\r\nMarch, 1845, which extended from 30 to 40 centimètres, and the locusts\r\nwere found heaped upon the ground to the height of three décimètres.\r\n\r\nIn the environs of Algiers alone were destroyed, in 1845, 369 quintals\r\nof locusts. It is computed that 400 locusts go to a kilogramme. This\r\ngives, then, a total of 14,760,000 insects destroyed. As in this\r\nnumber half were probably females, and as each female lays on an\r\naverage seventy eggs, the result we arrive at is, that this stopped\r\nthe production of 516,600,000 larvæ on the territory of Algiers alone.\r\nThe invasion of locusts which took place in 1866 was as disastrous as\r\nthat of 1845. It was in the month of April, 1866, that the vanguard of\r\nthese destructive insects appeared. Debouching through the mountain\r\ngorges and through the valleys, into the fertile plains near the\r\ncoast, they alighted first on the plain of Mitidja and on the Sahel\r\nof Algiers. Their mass, at certain points, intercepted the light of\r\nthe sun, and resembled those whirlwinds of snow which, during the\r\nstorms of winter, hide the nearest objects from our view. Very\r\nsoon the cabbages, the oats, the barley, the late wheat, and the\r\nmarket-gardeners' plants, were partly destroyed. In some places the\r\nlocusts penetrated into the interiors of the houses. By order of the\r\ngovernment of Algiers the troops joined the colonists in combating the\r\nplague; and the Arabs, when they found that their interests were\r\nsuffering, rose to lend their aid against the common enemy. Immense\r\nquantities of locusts were destroyed in a few days; but what could\r\nhuman efforts do against these winged multitudes, who escape into\r\nspace, and only abandon one field to alight in the next?\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to prevent the fecundation of these insects. The\r\neggs quickly producing innumerable larvæ, the first swarms were very\r\nsoon not only replaced, but multiplied a hundredfold by a new\r\ngeneration. The young locusts are particularly formidable on account\r\nof their voracity. These hungry masses threw themselves upon\r\neverything which was left by those which went before them. They choked\r\nup the springs, the canals, and the brooks; and it was not without a\r\ngreat deal of trouble that the waters were cleared of these causes of\r\ninfection. Almost at the same time the provinces of Oran and of\r\nConstantine were invaded. At Tlemcen, where within the memory of man\r\nlocusts had never appeared, the ground was covered with them. At\r\nSidi-bel-Abbes, at Sidi-Brahim, at Mostaganem, they attacked the\r\ntobacco, the vines, the fig-tree, and even the olive-trees, in spite\r\nof the bitterness of their foliage. At Relizane and at L'Habra they\r\nattacked the cotton-fields. The road, 80 kilomètres long, which\r\nconnects Mostaganem with Mascara, was covered to the whole of its\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Constantine the locust appeared almost\r\nsimultaneously, from the Sahara to the sea, and from Bougia to La\r\nCalle. At Batna, at Setif, at Constantine, at Guelma, at Bona, at\r\nPhilippeville, at Djidjelly, the inhabitants struggled with energy\r\nagainst this invasion, but neither fire nor any obstacles opposed to\r\nthe advance of this winged army were able to stop their ravages. The\r\nFrench Government, to alleviate as much as possible the ruin which was\r\nthus brought upon the colony, opened a public subscription at the end\r\nof the year 1866.\r\n\r\nThe negroes of Soudan endeavour to frighten the locusts in their\r\nflight by savage yells. In Hungary they employed for the same object\r\nthe noise of cannon. In the middle ages, for the want of cannon, they\r\nexorcised the locusts. A traveller of the sixteenth century, the monk\r\nAlvarez, relates that he also employed exorcisms against an immense\r\nhost of these destructive insects which he met with in Ethiopia. When\r\nhe perceived them, he made the Portuguese and the natives form in\r\nprocession, and ordered them to chant psalms. \"Thus chanting,\" says\r\nhe, \"we went into a country where the corn was, which having reached,\r\nI made them catch a good many of these locusts, to whom I delivered an\r\nadjuration, which I carried with me in writing, by me composed the\r\npreceding night, summoning, admonishing, and excommunicating them.\r\nThen I charged them in three hours' time to depart to the sea, or else\r\nto go to the land of the Moors, leaving the land of the Christians; on\r\ntheir refusal of which, I adjured and convoked all the birds of the\r\nair, animals, and tempests, to dissipate, destroy, and devour them;\r\nand for this admonition I had a certain quantity of these locusts\r\nseized, and pronouncing these words in their presence, that they might\r\nnot be ignorant of them, I let them go, so that they might tell the\r\nrest.\" If one reflects that on their arrival in the land of the Moors,\r\nthese same locusts were perhaps received by prayers which had for\r\ntheir object to send them back to the land of the Christians, they\r\nmust have been very much embarrassed by such contradictory\r\nadjurations.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs have also an infallible means of ridding themselves of the\r\nlocusts. Here is what General Daumas tells us on the subject According\r\nto Ben-Omar, the Prophet read one day, on the wings of a locust,\r\nwritten in Hebrew characters: \"We are the troops of the Most High God;\r\nwe each one lay ninety-nine eggs. If we were to lay a hundred we\r\nshould devastate the whole world.\" Upon which Mahomet, greatly\r\nalarmed, made an ardent prayer, in which he begged God to destroy\r\nthese enemies of Mussulmans. In answer to this invocation, the angel\r\nGabriel told Mahomet that a part of his prayer should be granted.\r\nSince that epoch, indeed, words of invocation to the Prophet, written\r\non a piece of paper, and enclosed in a reed, which is planted in the\r\nmiddle of a wheat-field or orchard, have the power of turning away the\r\nlocusts.[80] This receipt is infallible, at least so say the devout\r\nMussulmans.\r\n\r\n    [80] \"Le Grand Désert,\" par le Général E. Daumas et E. de\r\n    Chaucel. In 18mo. Paris, 1860.\r\n\r\nThere exists another quite as efficacious. They take four locusts, and\r\nwrite on the wings of each a verse of the Koran (four verses of the\r\nKoran are appropriated to this purpose). They then let the locusts\r\nthus marked fly into the midst of the swarm, and the flying army\r\nimmediately take another direction.\r\n\r\nBy what the Arabs say, the locusts possess a number of virtues. When\r\nyou see them in a dream, they announce the future; if you dream that\r\nyou are eating them, it is a good omen; if you dream that it rains\r\ngolden locusts, God will restore to you that which you have lost; &c.\r\nWhen Omar-ben-el-Khottal was Caliph, the locusts seemed to have\r\ncompletely disappeared. There was great sadness in the country in\r\nconsequence. The Caliph especially was very much afflicted at it. He\r\nsent carriers into Yemen, into Cham, and into Irak, to see if they\r\ncould not find a few. One of the _envoyés_ succeeded in his mission,\r\nand brought back a handful of locusts. \"God is great!\" cried Omar, who\r\nfrom that day had no more misgivings. In order to understand first the\r\ndespair and then the satisfaction of the Caliph Omar, it is written,\r\nso say the Mussulmans, that the human race will disappear from the\r\nearth after the extinction of the locusts; that these insects were\r\nformed of the rest of the clay out of which man had been formed, and\r\nthat they were destined to serve him as food.\r\n\r\nAnd so locusts and fish are the only creatures which God allows the\r\nMussulman to eat without being skinned. They must, however, have been\r\nkilled by one of the faithful, for otherwise their flesh is impure!\r\nThe Arabs eat, and are very fond of locusts. When he was asked his\r\nopinion on this article of food, the Caliph Omar-ben-el-Khottal said,\r\n\"I only wish I had a basketful of them, wouldn't I scrunch them!\"\r\n\r\nAccording to General Daumas, locusts, fresh or preserved, are good\r\nfood for both men and camels. They are eaten grilled or boiled, or\r\nprepared in the kous-koussou, after their legs, wings, and heads have\r\nbeen taken off. Sometimes they are dried in the sun, and reduced to\r\npowder, which is mixed with milk, and made into cakes with flour,\r\ndripping, or butter and salt. Camels are very fond of them; and they\r\nare given to them after having been dried, or roasted between two\r\nlayers of ashes. Dried and salted, they are in Asia and in Africa an\r\nobject of commerce. At Bagdad they sometimes cause the price of meat\r\nto fall. The taste of their flesh may be compared to that of the crab.\r\nEastern nations have eaten locusts from time immemorial. The Greek\r\ncomic poet, Aristophanes, tells us, in the \"Acharnians,\" that the\r\nGreeks sold them in the markets. Moses allowed to the Jews four\r\nspecies, which are mentioned in Leviticus. St. John the Baptist,\r\nfollowing the example of the prophet Amos, made them his food in the\r\ndesert, where he found nothing but locusts and a little honey. The\r\nwholesomeness of this food was, however, disputed among the ancients.\r\nStrabo relates that there existed on the borders of the gulf of Arabia\r\na people called by him _Acridophagi_, or Locust-eating people; but\r\nthey all came to a miserable end. These people procured for themselves\r\nlocusts by lighting great fires, when the equinoctial winds brought\r\nthese hosts. Blinded and suffocated by the smoke, the locusts fell to\r\nthe ground, and were picked up greedily by them, and eaten, fresh or\r\nsalted. \"These locust-eaters,\" says Strabo, \"are, it is true, active,\r\ngood runners; but their life never exceeds forty years. As they\r\napproach this age, a horrible vermin issues from their bodies, which\r\neats them up, beginning from the belly, and so they die a miserable\r\ndeath.\" The same tale is to be met with in a description of Admiral\r\nDrake's voyage round the world. This traveller speaks of the natives\r\nof Ethiopia, who live on locusts, as dying eaten up by winged insects\r\nbred in their own bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to explain the origin of such fables. Travellers who\r\nhave visited Arabia agree in declaring that the locust is a most\r\nwholesome article of food; that it is even fattening. At any rate, it\r\nis good food for cattle and poultry. The ancients employed locusts in\r\nmedicine. Dioscorides asserts that the thighs of the locust, reduced\r\nto powder, and mixed with the blood of the he-goat, is a cure for\r\nleprosy; and mixed with wine, is a specific against the bite of the\r\nscorpion, &c.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to describe some other species of grasshoppers less\r\ndestructive in their ravages than the _Acridium migratorium_.\r\n\r\nIn the deserts of Egypt is to be met with the great _Eremobia_, and\r\nin South America the _Ommexeca_, which walks rather than springs. On\r\nthe other hand, the _Tetrix_ springs very well. A remarkable feature\r\nabout them is their thorax, which is prolonged into a point, and\r\ncovers the whole body. They are small insects of gay and brilliant\r\ncolours, and generally remain on the leaves of low plants, and escape\r\neasily from the hand that tries to catch them. The _Tetrix subulata_,\r\nof a brownish colour, is common during spring, in the environs of\r\nParis, in the woods, and in dry and arid fields. The _Pneumoræ_ are\r\nvery strange insects. The males have a very prominent abdomen, which\r\nresembles a bladder filled with air; and their wings are very much\r\ndeveloped. The females have the abdomen of the ordinary shape; their\r\nwings are very short, or even quite rudimentary. The former produce a\r\nsharp stridulation, by rubbing their hind-legs against a row of small\r\ntubercles, which are to be seen on each side of the abdomen. The sound\r\nis rendered still more penetrating by the vesiculous or bladder-like\r\nabdomen, the skin of which is stretched as tight as a drum. The\r\n_Pneumoræ_ inhabit the South of Africa, as also do the _Truxales_, a\r\nfew varieties of which, however, are to be met with in Spain, Sicily,\r\nand the South of France.\r\n\r\nWe will pass in silence over a great number of other less interesting\r\nspecies of Orthoptera. Those which we have described suffice to\r\njustify us in what we said above, namely, that this order contains\r\ninsects of the strangest and most anomalous forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nHYMENOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Order Hymenoptera comprises those insects which have four naked\r\nmembranous wings, lying in repose horizontally upon the body, and\r\nintersected by a network of nerves. The name is derived from two Greek\r\nwords--[Greek: hymên], a membrane, and [Greek: pteron], a wing. The\r\nmouth is composed of two horny mandibles, jaws, and lips adapted for\r\nsuction.\r\n\r\nIt is amongst the Hymenoptera that we meet with the most industrious\r\ninsects, some of which seem to possess real intelligence. These little\r\nanimals offer the most admirable examples of sociability. Born\r\narchitects, they construct dwellings marvellously contrived, which\r\nserve them, at the same time, as nurseries in which to rear their\r\nprogeny, and storehouses in which to lay by their provisions. Nothing\r\ncan equal the solicitude with which they watch over their young larvæ,\r\nstill incapable of motion. They form republics, governed by immutable\r\nlaws, and make war against their enemies in order of battle. They have\r\npredilections or antipathies for those who court their society, on\r\naccount of the material advantages they derive from them.\r\n\r\nThe Bees, the Humble Bees, the Wasps, and the Ants, are the best-known\r\ntypes of this order of insects. Among a great number of the\r\nHymenoptera the females are armed with a sting, or lancet, a wound\r\nfrom which causes great pain. All these insects undergo complete\r\nmetamorphoses. In the larva state the aculeate species are incapable\r\nof motion and of obtaining food; but Nature has provided in different\r\nways for their preservation. They are often lodged and fed by the\r\nworkers of the tribe, unfruitful females, which, with a self-denial\r\nvery rare in Nature, seem to have no other vocation than to sacrifice\r\nthemselves to the welfare of the larvæ. The workers construct the nest\r\nand bring in the provisions. This is the case with honey bees, wasps,\r\nand ants.\r\n\r\nSome deposit their eggs in the bodies of other insects, which die\r\nimmediately the larvæ which live in them have attained their full\r\ndevelopment. The larvæ of the _Chalcididæ_ and of the _Ichneumonidæ_\r\nfurnish examples of Hymenoptera which inhabit the interior of the body\r\nof another insect. Other parasitical species carry on their\r\ndepredations in a different way. They content themselves with laying\r\ntheir eggs in the nests of other species of the order, which have the\r\nadvantage over them in being able to construct for themselves places\r\nof refuge. Their larvæ live thus on their neighbours' goods,\r\nnourishing themselves on the provisions which were laid up for others.\r\nIn this way live the _Cleptes_, the _Chrysides_, &c. Lastly, others,\r\nsuch as the Gall-insects, and the _Tenthredinetæ_, or Saw-flies, live\r\nin their first state exposed on plants, and feed upon their leaves.\r\n\r\nWe shall only here describe the principal families of the Order\r\nHymenoptera, which contains a considerable number of species. These\r\nfamilies will be--1st. The _Apiariæ_, containing the Honey Bees, the\r\n_Melipodes_, and the Humble Bees. 2nd. The _Vespiariæ_, or Wasps. 3rd.\r\nThe _Formicariæ_, or Ants. 4th. The _Gallicolæ_, or Gall-insects.\r\n\r\nBEES.--Man, from the very earliest age, before any civilisation\r\nexisted, knew the value of bees, and took advantage of the products of\r\nthese industrious insects. The Bible makes mention of honey bees.\r\nTheir Hebrew name is _Deborah_. The Greeks called them by the name of\r\n_Melissa_, or _Melitta_.\r\n\r\nTheir wonderful architectural powers, their economical forethought,\r\nthe wonderful combination of their reasonings, which denote a real\r\nintelligence, their admirable social organisation, have in all times\r\nfixed the attention of naturalists, as they have also that of poets\r\nand thinkers. Virgil has celebrated them. In the fourth book of his\r\nGeorgics, the Latin poet has summed up all that the ancients knew\r\nabout bees. He paints with a good deal of truth many traits in their\r\nhistory, points out their enemies, and sets forth with accuracy all\r\nthe care that should be taken of them. In the words of the Mantuan\r\npoet, they are heavenly gifts, _dona cælestia_, and their intelligence\r\nexcited his admiration:--\r\n\r\n  \"His quibus signis atque hæc exempla secuti,\r\n  Esse apibus partem divinæ mentis, et haustus\r\n  Æthereos dixere.\" ...\r\n\r\nLet us hasten to say, however, that all which the ancients,\r\nnaturalists or poets, Greek or Latin, relate on the subject of bees,\r\nis a mixture of truth and error, and rests generally on mere\r\nsupposition. Aristotle knew well the three sorts of individuals which\r\nare comprised under the title of bees, and some other principal facts\r\nrelating to their history; but these facts are not stated accurately\r\nand precisely in his account of them, and they are, above all,\r\nmisinterpreted. The Greek philosopher understood insects in general\r\nvery badly. He made them spring from the leaves of trees, and brought\r\nforward a multitude of errors about them, which the most simple\r\nobservation would have sufficed to dissipate. Pliny tells us that\r\nAristomachus of Soles consecrated fifty-eight years to the observation\r\nof the habits of the bee, and that Philiscus of Thrace passed, for the\r\nsame motive, all his life in the forests. But this devotion to one\r\nobject does not appear to have produced much result, if one compares\r\nthe discoveries of our own age with the errors which Pliny, Aristotle,\r\nand Columella have chronicled respecting them. Pliny says that bees\r\noccupy the first rank among insects, and that they were created for\r\nman, for whom their work procures honey and wax. He adds that they\r\nform political associations, that they have councils, chiefs, and even\r\na code of morality and principles.\r\n\r\nOne sees by this opinion of the Roman naturalist in what high esteem\r\nthe ancients held bees. But they had the most singular ideas on the\r\nreproduction of these little beings; and as no one had ever seen their\r\ngeneration, they invented fable after fable to explain their origin.\r\nSome pretended that bees sprang from an ox recently killed, and buried\r\nin manure. Others added that they only sprang into existence from the\r\nchest of a young ox killed with violence. The most courageous bees\r\ncame from the belly of a lion in a state of putrefaction. It was from\r\nthe head of this same animal, in a state of corruption, that the\r\n_kings_ (_i.e._, the _queens_) were formed. The carcases of cows\r\nfurnished the mild and tractable bees; a calf could only furnish small\r\nand weak ones. Other naturalists, or rather other dreamers, made these\r\ninsects spring from the calices of sweet-scented flowers. Combined and\r\nseparated in a certain manner, the flowers engendered bees. They said,\r\nfurther, that the bees sought on the blossoms of the olive trees and\r\nof the reed a seed which they rendered fit for the formation of their\r\nlarvæ.\r\n\r\nAll these fables, which sprang from the imagination of the ancients,\r\nwere developed by a writer of the Renaissance, a certain Alexander de\r\nMontfort, author of a work entitled \"Printemps de l'Abeille.\" If we\r\nwere to believe him, the king of the bees is formed of the juice which\r\nthe workers extract from plants. These latter are created from honey;\r\nand the tyrants, _i.e._, the females, which do not manage to become\r\nsovereigns of a hive, are formed only of gum. It will be seen that he\r\nhad profited only too well by what he had read in Greek and Roman\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nThe bee was very much thought of in ancient Egypt, and is often\r\nrepresented on their monuments, above the sculptured ornaments which\r\ncontain proper names, with two semicircles and a sort of sheaf, or\r\nfasciculus. Champollion Figeac thinks that this group, taken together,\r\nrepresents a title added to a proper name. According to Hor-Apollon,\r\nanother commentator on Egyptian hieroglyphics, the bee in the country\r\nof the Pharaohs was the emblem of a people sweetly submissive to the\r\norders of its king. Nothing can be better than this comparison. It was\r\nfor this reason, no doubt, that Napoleon I. sprinkled the symbolical\r\nbees over the imperial mantle which bears the arms of his dynasty.\r\n\r\nAll the fables, all the hypotheses, spread about and cherished by the\r\nancients respecting these industrious little insects, were dissipated\r\nin a moment when, by the invention of glass bee-hives, first made in\r\nthe beginning of the last century by Maraldi, a mathematician of Nice,\r\nwe were enabled to observe their operations and habits. It is from\r\nthis period only that our exact knowledge of the really wonderful life\r\nof these insects dates. Before Maraldi, the Dutch naturalist,\r\nSwammerdam, had written an excellent \"History of Bees.\" He died before\r\nhe had published his work, and when, a long while after his death, it\r\nwas at length printed, other investigators had already pushed on their\r\nobservations further than he had. Thanks to the invention of Maraldi,\r\nRéaumur, John Hunter, Schirach, and Francis Huber, had unveiled, by\r\ntheir admirable researches, the wonderful habits of these insects. The\r\ndiscoveries of Francis Huber seem to be almost miraculous, when we\r\nremember that this observer was blind from the age of seventeen.\r\n\r\nDeprived of sight, Francis Huber did not the less wish to consecrate\r\nhis life to the observation and the study of Nature. He caused the\r\nbest works of his day on natural history and physics to be read to\r\nhim, his usual reader being his servant, named Francis Burnens, a\r\nnative of the Pays de Vaud. The honest Burnens took a singular\r\ninterest in all he read, and showed by his judicious reflections the\r\ntrue talent of an observer, and Huber resolved to cultivate his\r\ntalent. Very soon he could place implicit reliance in his companion,\r\nand see with another's eyes as if they were his own.\r\n\r\nThe two naturalists (we do not hesitate to give this title to the poor\r\npeasant of the canton of Vaud who so well seconded his master in his\r\nlong hours of study) conceived a host of original experiments, which\r\nled them to discover truths which no one up to that time had dreamt\r\nof. The results of their researches were published, in 1789, in a\r\nvolume which produced a profound sensation among naturalists.[81]\r\nBurnens was at a later period called back to the bosom of his family,\r\nand invested by his fellow-citizens with important functions. Francis\r\nHuber then continued his observations through the eyes of the\r\nexcellent wife he had married. A second volume was thus composed by\r\nhim twenty years after the appearance of the first. This volume was\r\npublished by his son, Pierre Huber, to whom we are indebted for the\r\nadmirable researches concerning ants, of which we shall have to speak\r\nfurther on.\r\n\r\n    [81] \"Nouvelles Observations sur les Abeilles,\" par François\r\n    Huber. Paris et Genève, in 8vo. 2e edition. 1814.\r\n\r\nWe will now speak of the habits of the bees. The labours of Réaumur,\r\nof Schirach, and of Huber, have perfectly revealed them to us, and\r\nhave initiated us completely into the habits of these precious\r\ninsects, which are for us to a certain extent domestic animals. We\r\nwill begin by describing the Common Bee (_Apis mellifica_).\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the year the population of our hives is\r\ncomposed exclusively of two sorts of individuals--the female, or\r\nmother bee, called also the queen bee; and the working bees, or\r\nneuters, which are, properly speaking, females incompletely developed.\r\nA third kind of individuals, the males, called also drones, are\r\ngenerally not met with except from May to July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309.--Working Bee (_Apis mellifica_).]\r\n\r\nThe working bees are the people, the crowd, the _servum pecus_, the\r\nliving force, the bee community. They are recognised by their small\r\nsize, reddish brown colour, and, above all, by the palettes and\r\nbrushes with which the hind legs are furnished.\r\n\r\nThe three pairs of legs which are inserted in its thorax are its\r\ntools. The two hind-legs are longer than the other pairs, and present\r\non the exterior a triangular depression, resembling a _palette_, which\r\nis surrounded by stiff hairs, forming, as it were, the borders of a\r\nsort of basket, in which the insect deposits the pollen of flowers.\r\nThe broadest part of the leg articulates with the tarsus, which is of\r\na square form, smooth on the exterior, and having hairs on its\r\ninterior surface, which has caused it to be named the brush. The joint\r\nis used for gathering the pollen; it folds back on the leg (Fig. 310),\r\nand forms with it a sort of small pair of pincers; and, finally, the\r\nleg is terminated by four smaller articulations, the last of which is\r\narmed with hooks. The other tools of the working bee consist of a pair\r\nof movable mandibles, which close the mouth on its two sides, and of a\r\ntrunk or proboscis (Fig. 311), which may be considered as a sort of\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310.--Leg of a Bee (magnified).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311.--Trunk of a Bee (magnified).]\r\n\r\nWith its mandibles the working bee seizes any hard substance. The\r\ntrunk serves it to collect the juice lying on the surface of the\r\npetals, or at the bottom of the corolla of the flower. When a bee has\r\nsettled on a full-blown flower, it is seen immediately to make for the\r\ninterior of the corolla, to put out its trunk, and apply it to the\r\npetals; it lengthens, shortens, and twists and bends it in all\r\ndirections. When the hairy surface of this organ is covered with\r\nvegetable juice, the bee returns it to its mouth, and deposits the\r\nbooty in a conduit, whence the juice passes into the first stomach.\r\nThis trunk is then, in all respects, a tongue, with which the bee\r\nsucks, licks, and pumps up the honey of flowers. But it also gathers\r\nthe pollen. When it enters a flower the bee covers itself with pollen\r\nfrom head to foot, and then passing its brushes carefully over its\r\nwhole body, removes the dust which adheres to it in every part, and\r\npiles it up on the triangular palettes of its hind-legs, in such a\r\nmanner as to form balls of greater or less size. If the flower is not\r\nquite full blown, the bee makes use of its mandibles to open the\r\nanthers, in which case the front pair of legs transmit the booty to\r\nthe second pair, which stores them in the baskets of the third. When\r\nit has gathered as much as it can carry, the bee returns to the hive,\r\nits legs laden with pollen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312.--Male, or Drone (_Apis mellifica_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313.--Female, or Queen (_Apis mellifica_).]\r\n\r\nThis complete set of tools which we have just described is only to be\r\nmet with among the working bees. The males, or drones (Fig. 312),\r\nlarger and more hairy than the working bees, emitting a sonorous and\r\nbuzzing sound, have no palettes on their legs, the hairs on their\r\ntarsi are not appropriated to the work of gathering, their mandibles\r\nare shorter, and they have no _aculeus_, or sting, which is the\r\nworking bee's weapon.\r\n\r\nThe female, or queen (Fig. 313), is smaller than the male, and has a\r\nlonger body than the working bees, and the wings, shorter in\r\nproportion, cover only the half of its body, whereas with the other\r\nbees they cover it entirely. The only part she has to play is that of\r\nlaying eggs, and so she has no palettes and brushes. The sovereign is,\r\nas suits her supreme rank, exempted from all work. She is always\r\nescorted by a certain number of working bees, who brush her, lick her,\r\npresent honey to her with their trunks, save her every kind of\r\nfatigue, and compose a train worthy of her feminine majesty. One very\r\nremarkable fact is that only one queen lives in each hive. Perfect\r\nsovereign of this tiny state, she rules over a people of some\r\nthousands of workers. It is not rare to find 20,000 working bees in a\r\nhive, and all submissively obey their sovereign. The number of males\r\nis scarcely one-tenth part of that of the working bees; and they only\r\nlive about three months. The workers represent the active life of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\"The exterior of a hive,\" says M. Victor Rendre, \"gives the best idea\r\nof this people, essentially laborious. From sunrise to sunset, all is\r\nmovement, diligence, bustle; it is an incessant series of goings and\r\ncomings, of various operations which begin, continue, and end, to be\r\nrecommenced. Hundreds of bees arrive from the fields, laden with\r\nmaterials and provisions; others cross them and go in their turn into\r\nthe country. Here, cautious sentinels scrutinise every fresh arrival;\r\nthere, purveyors, in a hurry to be back at work again, stop at the\r\nentrance to the hive, where other bees unload them of their burdens;\r\nelsewhere it is a working bee which engages in a hand-to-hand\r\nencounter with a rash stranger; farther on the surveyors of the hive\r\nclear it of everything which might interfere with the traffic or be\r\nprejudicial to health; at another point the workers are occupied in\r\ndrawing out the dead body of one of their companions; all the outlets\r\nare besieged by a crowd of bees coming in and going out, the doors\r\nhardly suffice for this hurrying, busy multitude. All appears disorder\r\nand confusion at the approaches to the hive, but this tumult is only\r\nso in appearance; an admirable order presides over this emulation in\r\ntheir work, which is the distinctive feature in bees.\"[82] A very\r\nsimple calculation may serve to give us an idea of this prodigious\r\nactivity. The opening of a well-stocked hive gives passage to one\r\nhundred bees a minute, which makes, from five o'clock in the morning\r\ntill seven o'clock in the evening, eighty thousand re-entrances, or\r\nfour excursions for each bee, supposing there is a population of\r\ntwenty thousand workers.\r\n\r\n    [82] \"L'Intelligence des Bêtes.\" In 18mo. Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\nLet us now follow their occupations from the moment in which they\r\nestablish themselves in a hive. The workers begin by stopping up all\r\nthe openings except one door, which is always to remain open. A\r\ncertain number set out to look for a resinous and sweet-scented\r\nsubstance, known under the name of _propolis_, which is destined to\r\ncover the inner surface of the hive, as its name shows, which is\r\nderived from a Greek word signifying outskirts, or suburb. Huber\r\nasserts that it is gathered from the buds of plants. This substance\r\nhas not yet been employed in the arts, although it possesses the same\r\nqualities as wax, as M. de Frarière remarks in his work \"On Bees and\r\nBee-keeping.\"[83] The propolis is employed in Italy for making\r\nblisters. This gum is viscous and very adherent. The bee works it up\r\ninto balls, and carries it in this form to the hive, where other\r\nlabourers take possession of it. They seize the pellet with their\r\nmandibles, and apply it to cracks which they have to make air-tight.\r\nThey use the propolis for another purpose still, which deserves to be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n    [83] \"Sur les Abeilles et l'Apiculture.\" In 18mo. 2e edition.\r\n    Paris.\r\n\r\nIt happens sometimes that an enemy penetrates into their hive, and\r\nthat the bees are not strong enough to cast this intruder out of their\r\ndwelling. What do they do? As soon as they have discovered the\r\ninvasion of their domicile, they set upon the impudent intruder, and\r\nsting him to death. But how can they drag out the dead body, which is\r\noften very heavy? such, for instance, as a slug. On the other hand, it\r\nwould be dangerous to abandon its carcase in the midst of the hive. A\r\nRoman Emperor said that the dead bodies of our enemies always smelt\r\ngood. This is not the opinion of the bees. They know that if they\r\nabandon the carcase in the hive it would infect the place, to the\r\ngreat danger of their health. They therefore embalm it. They encase it\r\nin propolis, which preserves it from putrefaction. It is said that the\r\nart of embalming was practised for the first time by the ancient\r\nEgyptians. It is an error: the first inventors of this art were bees.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of a slug, it is a snail whose evil genius has conducted\r\nit into the interior of a beehive, the proceeding is more simple. The\r\nmoment he has received one sting, the snail retires under the\r\nprotecting roof of his movable house. The bees thereupon at once wall\r\nhim in by closing the opening to his shell with this material. The\r\nshell is then cemented to the floor of the hive, and the house of the\r\npoor mollusc, become its tomb, remains thus in the midst of the hive,\r\nas a sort of decorative tumulus. When the sides of the hive are well\r\nclosed, the bees lay the foundations of their cells.\r\n\r\nIt was not formerly so easy to observe the details of the work done by\r\nthe bees as it is at the present day; for these insects, once in their\r\nhives, have a great aversion to the light. If they are put into a\r\nglazed hive, their first care is to shut up all the windows, either by\r\nplastering them over with propolis, or by forming, by means of the\r\nwell-marshalled battalion of working bees, a sort of living curtain.\r\nIn order to be able to take them unawares, and study them at his own\r\nconvenience, Huber constructed a hive with leaves, which opened like a\r\nbook. Fig. 314, which represents the hive with leaves, which is\r\nsometimes used, gives an idea of the plan adopted by Huber in order to\r\nenable him at will to open the hive and surprise its inmates. Huber\r\nhad also recourse in certain cases to a glass cage placed in the\r\ninterior of the hive, and which he could easily move to the light.\r\n\r\nThanks to his ingenuity, Huber was able to follow the working bees in\r\nall the various phases of their labours. When they begin to construct\r\ntheir hives they divide the work among themselves. A first detachment\r\nis employed to gather the wax, which is the building stone of our\r\nlittle architects. It was thought for a long time that wax was solely\r\nthe pollen of flowers, elaborated in the stomach of bees, and then\r\ndisgorged by the mouth. It was reserved for a peasant of Lusac to be\r\nthe first to discover the true nature of this secretion. This\r\nobserver, who did not belong to any school, or at most belonged to\r\nNature's school, found the flakes of wax sticking between the lower\r\narches of the rings of the abdomen or belly of the working bee. The\r\nwax, then, is produced by the insect by exudation, and is not simply\r\nthe pollen gathered from flowers. Huber himself states that bees\r\nexclusively nourished on pollen do not secrete wax, and that, on the\r\ncontrary, they do furnish it when they eat saccharine matter. It is\r\neasy to perceive the little plates of wax by slightly raising the last\r\nrings of the bee's abdomen. Fig. 315 represents a bee very heavily\r\nladen with this matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314.--Bee-hive in Leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315.--Bee seen through a magnifying glass at the\r\nmoment when the plates of wax appear between the segments of the\r\nabdomen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316.--Clusters of Bees.]\r\n\r\nThe working bees suspend themselves from the roof of the hive in such\r\na manner as to form festoons. The first clings to the roof with his\r\nfront legs, the second hooks himself on to the hind legs of the first,\r\nand so on, as is shown in Fig. 316. They in this manner form chains,\r\nfixed by the two ends to the roof, which serve as a bridge or ladder\r\nto the bees which join this assembly.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this is at last a cluster or swarm of bees which\r\nhangs down to the bottom of the hive. In this attitude they remain at\r\nfirst motionless, waiting till the honey in their stomachs is changed\r\ninto wax. When the wax is sufficiently elaborated in its organs, one\r\nof them detaches itself from the group of which it forms a part. It\r\ntakes between its legs one of the flakes of wax adhering to the rings\r\nof its abdomen, kneads it with its mandibles, moistens it with its\r\nsaliva, and gives it the appearance of a soft filament, which it\r\nsticks on to a projecting point of the roof. To this first layer it\r\nadds others, till it has exhausted all its wax. Then it leaves its\r\npost, and returns to the fields; another worker--another mason, as\r\nthey are sometimes called--succeeds it, and continues the laying of\r\nthe foundations. Presently shapeless blocks of wax hang down from the\r\nroof. It is in these blocks that other workers, with their mandibles,\r\nhollow out and form the first cells. While the workers continue to\r\nprolong the foundation-wall, and whilst the first cells are being\r\nshaped, new ones are roughly sketched out or rough-hewn, and the work\r\nadvances with a marvellous rapidity.\r\n\r\nEach cell forms a small hexagonal cup, closed on one side only by a\r\npyramidal base, produced by the meeting together of three rhombs. The\r\nhoneycombs are the result of two layers of cells placed back to back,\r\narranged in such a way that the bases of the one become the bases of\r\nthe other, the base of each little cell being formed by the union of\r\nthe bases of three opposite cells. The bees begin by forming the base\r\nof the cell; they then add the six sides, or walls, which are to\r\ncomplete the hexagonal cup. At the same time others set to work on the\r\nopposite side of the comb, and construct little cells back to back\r\nwith the cells of the front surface. They do not finish them off at\r\nonce. The walls are at first very thick: new workers, who succeed\r\nthose who merely mark out the work, being occupied in planing down the\r\nrough-hewn cells, and in reducing the walls to the desired thickness.\r\nThis work is accomplished with an incredible celerity, for the bees\r\ncan build as many as 4,000 cells in twenty-four hours. There is very\r\ngood reason for the hexagonal form being adopted by the bees in\r\nconstructing their cells, as it involves a question of economy, which\r\nthese insects have solved in their most admirable manner.\r\n\r\n\"When one has well examined,\" says Réaumur,[84] \"the true shape of\r\neach cell, when one has studied their arrangement, geometry seems to\r\nhave guided the design for the whole work, and to have presided over\r\nits execution. One finds that all the advantages which could have been\r\ndesired are here combined. The bees seem to have had to solve a\r\nproblem containing conditions which would have made the solution\r\nappear to be difficult to many geometricians. This problem may be thus\r\nenunciated:--Given a quantity of matter, say of wax, it is required to\r\nform cells which shall be equal and similar to each other, of a\r\ndetermined capacity, but as large as possible in proportion to the\r\nquantity of matter which is employed, and the cells to be so placed\r\nthat they may occupy the least possible space in the hive. To satisfy\r\nthis last condition, the cells should touch each other in such a\r\nmanner that there may remain no angular space between them, no gap to\r\nfill up. The bees have satisfied these conditions, and at the same\r\ntime they have satisfied the first conditions of the problem in making\r\ncells which are tubes having six equal sides, or in other words,\r\nhexagonal tubes.... We see still further that the best thing the bees\r\ncould do to economise their space and materials, was to compose their\r\nhoneycombs of two rows of cells turned in opposite directions.\"\r\n\r\n    [84] \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes,\" tome\r\n    v., p. 379.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317.--Cells constructed by Bees.]\r\n\r\nThis arrangement, it will be seen, enables them to economise the half\r\nof the wax intended for making the bases of the cells. They economise\r\nit still more by making the bases and the sides of the tubes extremely\r\nthin; the borders only of the comb being fortified by an excess of\r\nwax. These two-sided combs descend from the roof of the hive in\r\nparallel series, their thickness being about half an inch. They are\r\nfixed to the top by a sort of wax foot, and fastened to the sides by\r\nnumerous bands. The bees pass between the rows, besides excavating\r\ncircular openings, which serve as doors of communication. The form and\r\nthe general arrangement of these buildings are otherwise very varied,\r\naccording to circumstances. The bees always accommodate themselves to\r\nthe nature of the hive.\r\n\r\nIn all these operations they exhibit great judgment. It is impossible,\r\nwhen one has once seen them at work, to look on them as mere organised\r\nmachines, whose instinct is their spring of action; we are forced to\r\nconcede to them intelligence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318.--The cells of a Bee-hive. A, large cell\r\nintended for the larvæ of the _queens_. B, middling-sized cells\r\nintended for the larvæ of the _males_. C, small cells intended for the\r\nlarvæ of the _workers_.]\r\n\r\nThe cells are of three dimensions: the small ones intended for the\r\nlarvæ of the workers, the middling-sized ones for the larvæ of the\r\nmales, and the large ones for the larvæ of the queens.\r\n\r\nThese last--that is, the _royal cells_--are generally only about\r\ntwenty in number, in a hive containing 20,000 bees. Constructed of a\r\nmixture of wax and of propolis, resembling a rounded thimble, they\r\nform tubes of half an inch long, turned towards the exterior, and\r\nplaced always vertically, in such a manner as to appear detached from\r\nthe comb.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a _royal cell_ is equivalent to that of a hundred other\r\ncells. The bees spare nothing to make it comfortable and spacious. \"It\r\nis quite a Louvre,\" says Réaumur.\r\n\r\nBut independently of their use as cradles, these cells serve as\r\nstorehouses for honey.\r\n\r\nA few of these are used in turn for both these purposes, but a great\r\nnumber are reserved exclusively for stores of honey and pollen. This\r\nis brought, as we have already said, in the form of pellets, in the\r\nbaskets which the hind legs form. The working bee, when it has\r\ngathered it, pushes it into the cell, pressing it with its hind-legs.\r\nAnother then arrives, and kneads up the mass to make it adhesive. The\r\nbee brings the honey in its first stomach, and disgorges it into one\r\nof the cells where it is to be kept. However, it is not always by\r\ncarrying its honey into a cell that the worker is relieved of it,\r\noften finding an opportunity to deliver it on the way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319.--Interior of a Hive.]\r\n\r\n\"When it meets,\" says Réaumur,[85] \"any of its companions who want\r\nfood, and who have not had time to go and get any, it stops, erects\r\nand stretches out its trunk, so that the opening by which the honey\r\nmay be taken out is a little way beyond the mandibles. It pushes the\r\nhoney towards this opening. The other bees, who know well enough that\r\nit is from there they must take it, introduce the end of their trunks\r\nand suck it up. The bee which has not been stopped on its road, often\r\ngoes to the places where other bees are working, that is, to those\r\nplaces where other bees are occupied, either in constructing new\r\ncells, or in polishing or bordering the cells already built; it offers\r\nthem honey, as if to prevent them from being under the necessity of\r\nleaving their work to go and get it themselves.\"\r\n\r\n    [85] \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes,\" tome\r\n    v., p. 449.\r\n\r\nThe honey which fills the store cells is intended for daily\r\nconsumption, and also intended as a reserve for the period when the\r\nflowers furnish no more. The empty cells are left open, the workers\r\nmaking use of them when they want them, particularly during rainy\r\ndays, which keep them at home. But the cells which contain the honey\r\nput by in reserve are closed. \"They are,\" says Réaumur, \"like so many\r\npots of jam or jelly, each one of which has its covering, and a very\r\nsolid covering it is too.\" This covering, composed of wax,\r\nhermetically seals the pots containing this reserve of honey. The\r\nobject of this is to keep the honey in a certain state of liquidity,\r\nby preventing the evaporation of the water it contains. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that it does not run out of the cells which are open,\r\nalthough their position is almost always horizontal. This is because\r\nthere are always in the sides of these narrow tubes points enough to\r\nkeep it in, and that besides this the last layer of honey is always of\r\ngreater consistency than the liquid in the interior, and upon which it\r\nforms a sort of crust.\r\n\r\nWhen the harvest has been abundant, many combs of closed cells may be\r\nfound in each hive, perfect storehouses of abundance, furnished for\r\nthe wants of the bad season. When the construction of the cells goes\r\non well--often on the day after the bees have installed themselves in\r\ntheir hive--the queen goes out to meet the males. At the hour when\r\nthese are accustomed to disport themselves in the sun, that is to say,\r\nfrom noon till five o'clock, she leaves the hive, whirls about for a\r\nfew seconds, and disappears into the air. At the end of half an hour\r\nshe returns, pregnant.\r\n\r\nWhen the female returns to the hive, she is _the_ object of every\r\nattention, the workers pressing round her, and forming quite a train.\r\nMany approach her, and lick the surface of her body; others brush her,\r\ncaress her, and present her their trunks full of honey. Forty-eight\r\nhours after her return to the hive the mother bee generally begins\r\nlaying.[86] Running over the honeycomb, she deposits an egg in each\r\nempty cell, and fixes it to the bottom by means of a glutinous\r\nsecretion, in such a way that the egg is suspended in the interior of\r\nthe cell. They have the appearance of little oblong bodies, of a\r\nbluish white. If the queen, in a hurry to lay, lets more than one egg\r\nfall into the same cell, the workers who accompany her hasten to\r\ncarry out and destroy those that are in excess. This is often the case\r\nwhen the combs have not enough cells to contain all the eggs laid. We\r\nhave said that the queen only lays worker eggs at this time; the\r\nothers are laid later. She continues to lay until the cold weather\r\napproaches, when she ceases to do so, and does not resume her\r\noccupation until the return of spring. This laying is very abundant.\r\nThe queen produces at least two hundred eggs a day; so that in the\r\nspace of two months she lays more than twelve thousand. Towards the\r\neleventh month of her existence in the perfect state, the queen begins\r\nlaying the eggs which will produce males, their number varying from\r\n1,500 to 3,000; the deposition of these eggs occupies about a month.\r\n\r\n    [86] Not invariably, the period is often longer.--ED.\r\n\r\nTowards the twentieth day, the workers lay the foundations of some\r\nroyal cells. When these cells have attained a certain length, the\r\nqueen deposits an egg in each, allowing, however, one or two days to\r\nintervene between the laying of these privileged eggs, so that the\r\nyoung queens to whom they are to give birth should not be hatched all\r\nat the same time, which would cause difficulties and even wars\r\nconcerning the right of their succession to the throne. This\r\ncomplication human governments have not been always able to avoid, as\r\nhistory shows; but the bees have found out a way of doing so.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the eggs in the cells is not left to chance. Each\r\negg, according to the sex to which it belongs, is deposited in the\r\ncell which awaits it. The eggs of the females do not, however, differ\r\nin any way from those of the workers. The difference in their\r\ndevelopment depends entirely on the space and food allowed them.\r\n\r\nWe represent (Fig. 320) a portion of a comb containing the eggs placed\r\nin the cells, as also the royal cells. The regular order of laying is\r\nsuch as we have just described, but the result is quite different when\r\nthe impregnation of the queen has been retarded by an accidental\r\ncaptivity of two or three weeks. The longer this delay, the greater\r\nwill be the number of male eggs. If the queen is shut up for more than\r\ntwenty days after her birth, she can then lay nothing but male eggs\r\nduring the remainder of her existence. It seems, also, that this delay\r\ntroubles her intellect; for she then often makes blunders as to the\r\ncells. She lays the eggs of the males, or drones, in the cradles\r\nprepared for the queens, and thus brings confusion into the future\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, once laid, are left to the care of the working bees, which\r\nRéaumur called the nurses, in opposition to the wax-workers, which are\r\nemployed in works of construction. According to many bee-keepers, and\r\nespecially M. Hamet,[87] this division of duties is not positive. The\r\nyoung workers are the wax-workers; the old ones, collectors of honey,\r\nand nurses. However, when the honey-harvest is at its height, all the\r\nworkers collect the spoil. Every individual is pressed into the\r\nservice at the harvest time, as with men.\r\n\r\n    [87] \"Cours d'Apiculture.\" In 8vo. Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320.--Portion of the comb, with the eggs occupying\r\nthe cells. One of the royal cells has been opened by the queen.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs are not long in being hatched. From the moment when the larva\r\ncomes out of the egg till that of its metamorphosis into a pupa, it\r\nkeeps in its cell, rolled up, motionless as an Indian idol in its\r\nsacred temple. The working bees visit it from time to time, to see\r\nthat it wants for nothing, and to renew its provisions. They also\r\ncarefully inspect the different cells, and assure themselves of the\r\ngood condition of their nurslings. The pap which they give them as\r\nfood is whitish, and resembles paste made of flour. It is apparently a\r\npreparation of pollen, prepared in the body of the insect. As the\r\nlarvæ increase in size, their food is made to acquire a more decided\r\ntaste of honey, and to become even slightly acid. It seems, then,\r\nthat the bees know how to graduate the food of their larvæ in such a\r\nmanner as to bring it nearer by degrees to honey.\r\n\r\nIn the space of five days the larvæ are developed; they have absorbed\r\nall their pap, and have no need from that time of any nourishment, for\r\nthey are about now to change into pupæ. Now the nurses pay them a last\r\nattention. They wall them up in their cells, closing the openings with\r\na waxen covering. The larvæ then get close to the wax covering. In\r\nthirty-six hours they have spun for themselves a silky cocoon, in\r\nwhich they undergo their transformation into pupæ. The moult, which\r\nprecedes their metamorphosis, constitutes a crisis, as with the\r\ncaterpillars of Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321.--Larva of the Bee (magnified).]\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is hatched seven or eight days after its\r\ntransformation into a pupa, the organs being developed little by\r\nlittle, and the young bee is then ready to appear in the broad\r\ndaylight. It breaks through the thin transparent covering in which it\r\nis still swathed; then, with its mandibles, it pierces the operculum,\r\nor door of its prison, and opens a way for itself by which it can\r\nissue forth. With the assistance of its front legs it clings to the\r\nrim of the cell, and draws itself forward, till it has set free the\r\nwhole of its body. The other bees lavish upon this newly-arrived\r\nlittle stranger all possible attention, to make its entrance into the\r\nworld easy and agreeable; assisting and supporting it till it has\r\nbecome quite strong. It very soon becomes strong. If it is a working\r\nbee, it is not long in getting to work and in mixing with its\r\ncompanions in labour.\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which the hatching of ordinary bees takes place,\r\nworkers and males; the first, twenty days after they are laid; the\r\nsecond, twenty-four days after. The rearing and birth of the young\r\nqueens is slightly different. In proportion as the larvæ increase in\r\nsize do the workers enlarge the cells which contain them; and then\r\nagain gradually diminish their size as the moment of their last\r\nmetamorphosis approaches. A special and peculiar food is given to the\r\nlarvæ of the queens; it is quite different from that which is given to\r\nthe larvæ of the working bees, being a heavier and sweeter substance.\r\nThis special food seems to exercise such an energetic influence on the\r\ndevelopment of the ovaries, that simple workers which have\r\naccidentally received any of it, during their larval state, become\r\npregnant and lay a few eggs. But this anomalous development remains\r\nimperfect, because the prolific food was only administered in a small\r\nquantity. Besides which, the size of the cells is of great importance\r\nto the development of the larvæ imprisoned in them; and so the larvæ\r\nof working bees, having lived in the small cells, can never attain the\r\nproportions of the queen, nor acquire her fecundity. But all this is\r\nchanged if these larvæ are moved into the large cells and fed on this\r\nroyal pabulum; they then become veritable queens. If, with us, the\r\ncoat does not make the man nor the frock the monk, it is certain that\r\nwith the bees the cradle helps materially to make the queen.\r\n\r\nWhen the queen through some accident or other has perished, the\r\nplebeian population of the hive very quickly perceive the misfortune,\r\nand without losing time in useless regrets, apply themselves to repair\r\ntheir loss. They choose the larva of a working bee, less than three\r\ndays old, on which they bestow the treatment suited to change it into\r\na female. The workers enlarge the cell of this grub by demolishing the\r\nsurrounding cells, and administer to it a strong dose of royal food,\r\nto effect its transformation. This marvellous metamorphosis is\r\naccomplished like those which one reads of in fairy tales, where so\r\nmany poor beggars are changed, by a wave of the hand, into beautiful\r\nprincesses, covered with gold and precious stones. Only here the fairy\r\ntale is a true story; the poet's dream is a real phenomenon. According\r\nto Francis Huber, the larva intended to produce a female has to change\r\nits position. The workers add then to its domicile a sort of vertical\r\ntube, into which they push and turn round the young grub which is the\r\nhope of the community. For twelve days a bee, a sort of body-guard,\r\nhas special charge of the person of our infant. It offers it food, and\r\npays it many other delicate little attentions. When the moment for the\r\nmetamorphosis has come, the orifice of the tube is closed, and the\r\nbees await the hatching of the new queen. Thus the loss of the queen\r\nis speedily replaced. The larvæ of the queens, when they are shut up\r\nin their cells, have the head downwards, whilst the larvæ of the males\r\nhave the head upwards. Their hatching takes place thirteen days after\r\nthe laying of the eggs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they have quitted their cradles, the young queens are ready\r\nto take flight. The others, workers and males, are less strongly\r\norganised. Before they are able to take a part in the sports and\r\nlabours of the old ones they require a rest of twenty-four hours,\r\nduring which the nurses lick them, brush them, and offer them honey.\r\nBut the young workers require to undergo no apprenticeship before they\r\ndo the work which devolves upon them. They go straight to their work,\r\nand suppress all apprenticeship. Nature is their guide and counsellor.\r\n\r\nWhen the hatching has begun, each day adds some hundreds of young\r\nbees to the population of the hive, which is not long in becoming too\r\nsmall for the number of its inhabitants. It is then that those curious\r\nemigrations of this winged people take place which are called\r\n_swarms_. The queen leaves the hive, with a part of her subjects, and\r\nfounds a new colony elsewhere. In the climate of France the bees\r\ngenerally swarm in the months of May and June. In the south very\r\nthickly populated hives may furnish as many as four swarms in a\r\nseason, but in the north rarely more than one or two. But in some\r\nyears swarming does not take place at all, for the want of a\r\nsufficient population. In such cases the workers do not construct\r\nroyal cells at the period when the eggs of the males are laid, and the\r\nswarming is put off till the following spring. It occasionally happens\r\nthat a hive, although full of bees, cannot make up its mind to send\r\nout a swarm, and also that the hives thinly populated send out\r\nabundant swarms. There are, then, other causes than the excess of\r\npopulation which exercise an influence on this annual crisis in the\r\nlife of bees. The first swarm is always led by the old queen; if other\r\nswarms succeed, it is the young females lately hatched who lead the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThere are many signs which announce that a swarm is going to take\r\nplace. The appearance of the males, or drones, is one of the first\r\nsigns. Another sign, but far from being infallible, is the excess of\r\nthe population in the common home. The bees seem then to find\r\nthemselves so ill at ease in their over-crowded hive, that part of\r\nthem go out and keep outside, either on the stand upon which the hive\r\nis placed, or upon the hive itself. Crowds of bees may be seen heaped\r\nup on each other outside, only waiting for the signal of departure.\r\nBut the least equivocal of all the signs, that which points out the\r\nevent for the very day, says Réaumur, is when the bees of a hive do\r\nnot go into the country in as great a number as usual, although the\r\nweather may be favourable and seem to invite them to do so. \"There is\r\nno sign,\" says Réaumur, \"which points out so surely that a swarm is\r\npreparing to take flight, as when, in the morning, at those hours when\r\nthe sun shines, and when the weather is favourable for work, the bees\r\ngo out in a small number from a hive from which they went out in great\r\nquantities on the preceding days, and bring back only a little rough\r\nwax. The fact of their acting in this manner seems to force us to\r\nconcede to bees more intelligence and foresight than many people are\r\ninclined to allow that they possess; at any rate, it is exceedingly\r\npuzzling to those who wish to explain all their actions by saying that\r\nthey are purely mechanical. Does it not seem proved that from the\r\nmorning all the inhabitants of a hive have been informed of the\r\nproject which will be executed not before noon, or, perhaps, not for\r\nsome hours after it?... There is a well-known story of an old\r\ngrenadier, who, being comfortably asleep while his comrades were\r\npitching their tents, answered to his general, M. de Turenne, when\r\nquestioned on the subject, '_that he knew very well that the army\r\nwould not remain long in the camp they were pitching_.'\r\n\r\n\"All our bees, or nearly all, seemed to have foreseen the move that\r\ntheir queen was about to make, as that old soldier had foreseen the\r\ngeneral's order to his army.\"[88]\r\n\r\n    [88] \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes,\" tome\r\n    v., p. 611.\r\n\r\nIn a hive which is going to \"cast,\" as it is called in technical\r\nphraseology, there is often heard, in the evening, and even during the\r\nnight, a peculiar humming. All seems to be in agitation. Sometimes, to\r\nhear the noise, it will be necessary to bring your ear close to the\r\nhive; you then will hear nothing but clear and sharp sounds, which\r\nseem to be produced by the flapping of the wings of one single bee.\r\n\"Those who know better than I do the language of bees,\" says Réaumur,\r\n\"have told marvels of these sounds. They pretend that it is the new\r\nqueen that makes this noise; that she is, perhaps, haranguing the\r\ntroops she wishes to go with her; or that, with a kind of trumpet, she\r\nanimates them to undertake the great adventure. Charles Butler, the\r\nauthor of 'Female Monarchy,' attributes to this noise quite another\r\nsignification. He says that it seems as if the bee which aspires to\r\nbecome queen supplicates the queen-mother, by lamentations and groans,\r\nto grant it permission to lead a colony out from the hive; that the\r\nqueen does not yield sometimes to these touching prayers for two days;\r\nthat when she does acquiesce, she answers the suppliant in a fuller\r\nand stronger voice; and that when you have heard the mother-bee grant\r\nthis permission, you may hope next day to have a swarm.... Butler has\r\ndetermined all the modulations of the chant of the suppliant bee, the\r\ndifferent keys to which they are set, as also those of the chants of\r\nthe queen-mother. He pretends that it is not allowed to those who wish\r\nto raise themselves to a superior rank to imitate the chants of the\r\nsovereign; woe betide the young female if she should dare to do so! it\r\nwould only be in a spirit of revolt, and she would be immediately\r\npunished by the loss of her head. The old-established queen does more\r\nthan that: at the same moment she condemns to death those bees which\r\nhad been seduced.\"[89] The true cause of this unusual noise is the\r\nagitation of the wings of a great number of the bees in the middle of\r\nthe hive.\r\n\r\n    [89] _Ibid_, tome v., pp. 616, 617.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked, that when about to swarm the bees seem as if\r\nmad. They lose their senses; the queen setting them the example.\r\nFrancis Huber has made the most curious remarks on this subject. Here\r\nis, according to this immortal observer, what goes on in the hive when\r\nan emigration is about to take place:--The queen, being angry at the\r\nnoise which the young females ready to be hatched are making in their\r\ncells, runs about the hive, examines the cells, and endeavours to\r\ndestroy those which contain the females; but she meets with a very\r\nfirm resistance from the workers, who take upon themselves to protect\r\nthem. She endeavours here and there to lay an egg, but generally\r\nretires without having done so. She runs, stops short, sets off again,\r\nwalks over the bodies of the workers she meets; sometimes, when she\r\nstops, the bees near her stop also, as if to look at her. They advance\r\nbriskly towards her, strike her with their heads, and mount on her\r\nback. She then dashes off, carrying with her some of the workers. Not\r\none of them offers her honey; she takes it herself from the open\r\ncells, which are for the use of the whole hive. They no longer draw up\r\nin line on each side of her as she moves along, her guard of honour no\r\nlonger surrounds her; she seems fallen from her high rank.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first bees which were disturbed by her now follow,\r\nrunning like herself, and spread alarm in their turn among the rest of\r\nthe population. The road which the queen has traversed is to be\r\nrecognised by the excitement which she has caused on her passage, and\r\nwhich cannot now be calmed. Very soon she has visited every corner of\r\nthe hive, so that the fever has become general. She now no longer lays\r\nher eggs in the cells, but lets them fall anywhere at random. She\r\nseems to have lost her wits.\r\n\r\nThe nurses in their turn are attacked with the contagion. They pay no\r\nattention now to their charges. Those which return from the country\r\nhave no sooner entered the hive than they take part in these\r\ntumultuous movements, and give themselves up to the general\r\nexcitement. Not even thinking of depositing the pellets of pollen\r\nwhich they carry on their legs, they run about apparently without aim.\r\nThe delirium takes possession of the whole republic. The end of all\r\nthis is a general sortie. The whole hive, with the queen at its head,\r\nprecipitates itself towards the door, and issues forth to create a\r\nswarm. Once in the fresh air, they become quiet; their madness\r\nsubsides, and they fix themselves to a branch of a tree, and having\r\nbeen captured, set to work again as usual. Francis Huber often\r\nremarked that, in a swarm which had started, if the queen, who\r\ndirected the flight, were seized and killed, immediately all the bees\r\nwould return to the hive. It would seem that, having lost their chief,\r\nthey acknowledged themselves incapable of forming a colony.\r\n\r\nA swarm never comes out except on a fine day, or, to speak more\r\naccurately, at an hour of the day when the sun is shining, when the\r\nair is calm, and the sky clear. It is generally between ten o'clock in\r\nthe morning and three o'clock in the afternoon. \"We observed,\" says\r\nFrancis Huber, \"in a hive all the signs which are the fore-runners of\r\na cast for a swarm--disorder and agitation--but a cloud passed before\r\nthe sun, and quiet was restored to the hive; the bees thought no more\r\nof swarming. An hour after, the sun having shown itself again, the\r\ntumult recommenced, increased very rapidly, and the swarm set out on\r\nits journey.\"[90]\r\n\r\n    [90] In general, bees very much dislike bad weather; when they\r\n    are foraging in the country, the appearance of a single cloud\r\n    before the sun causes them to return home precipitately.\r\n    However, if the sky is uniformly dark and cloudy, and if there\r\n    are not any sudden alternations of darkness and light, they are\r\n    not easily alarmed, and the first drops of a gentle rain hardly\r\n    drive them away from their hunting-ground.\r\n\r\nAt the moment which precedes their exit, the buzzing increases in the\r\nhive. Some of the workers go out first, as if to ascertain the state\r\nof the atmosphere. The moment the queen has passed the threshold, the\r\nemigrants follow in a cloud behind her; in an instant the air is\r\ndarkened with bees, which crowd together and form a thick cloud. The\r\nswarm rises, whirling round about in the air; it poises itself for a\r\nfew minutes over the hive, to allow time to reconnoitre, and for the\r\nlaggards to join, and then goes off at full speed.\r\n\r\nThe queen does not make choice of the place where the company shall\r\nfind shelter. When a branch of a tree has been selected by a certain\r\nnumber, they fix themselves on it. Many others follow them. When a\r\ngreat many have collected, the queen joins the throng, and brings in\r\nher train the rest of the troop. The group already formed becomes\r\nlarger and larger every instant. Those which are still scattered about\r\nin the air hasten to join the majority, and very soon all together\r\ncompose one solid mass or clump of bees clinging to each other by\r\ntheir legs. This cluster (Fig. 322) is sometimes spherical, sometimes\r\npyramidal, and occasionally attains a weight of nine pounds, and may\r\ncontain as many as 40,000 bees. From this moment, although they are\r\nuncovered, they remain still. In a quarter of an hour everything\r\nbecomes quiet, and the bees cease to hover about the cluster more than\r\nround an ordinary hive. Now is the moment to take possession of the\r\nswarm in a hive prepared beforehand to receive it. If delayed too\r\nlong, the troop flies off, and establishes itself in some natural\r\ncavity, as the hollow of a tree, &c. The bees then return to their\r\nwild state.\r\n\r\nUnder a warm climate, where flowers abound, the hives may cast several\r\ntimes in succession. The first swarm, however, is always the best. It\r\nis more numerous, and has before it more time to provision itself. If\r\nthe weather remains favourable, it is not rare to see it send out a\r\nswarm itself three weeks after leaving the old hive. The old queen\r\nthen leads the emigration of the second swarm, abandoning the colony\r\nshe had lately founded. If the original hive sends forth several\r\nswarms, the interval between the first and the second is from seven to\r\nten days; the third and the fourth follow at shorter intervals. But\r\nthese late casts have rarely vitality enough to exist long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322.--Cluster of Bees hanging to a branch.]\r\n\r\nA swarm never returns to a hive it has once left. It is surprising\r\nthen that a hive can furnish a second swarm after the interval of a\r\nfew days, without being too much weakened. But the old queen, in\r\nquitting her domain, leaves behind her a considerable quantity of\r\nbrood. These larvæ are not long in re-peopling the hive, so as to\r\nfurnish a second swarm. The third and the fourth casts weaken the\r\npopulation more perceptibly; but there remain still enough workers to\r\ncontinue operations. In some cases the agitation of the cast is so\r\ngreat as to cause all the bees to quit the hive together, leaving it\r\ndeserted; but this desertion only lasts an instant, one part of the\r\nswarm wisely returning to their home.\r\n\r\nAll those which start away become members of the new colony. When the\r\ngeneral delirium we have spoken of has taken possession of them, they\r\nprecipitate themselves together, they pile themselves up all at the\r\nsame time by the door of the hive, and get so hot as to perspire\r\nfreely. Those which are in the midst of the _mêlée_ bear the weight of\r\nthe whole crowd, and seem bathed in sweat. Their wings become damp,\r\nand they are no longer able to fly, and even if they manage to escape,\r\nthey get no further than the stand, and are not long in re-entering\r\nthe hive, instead of following the main body of the emigrants. We must\r\nnot forget that a part of the population is always out at those hours\r\nof the day when the swarms take place, engaged in collecting\r\nprovisions; and having collected the spoil, these workers return to\r\nthe hive abandoned by the greater part of their companions, and betake\r\nthemselves to their usual occupations, as if nothing had happened.\r\nThey form the nucleus of the new population, which is soon enlarged by\r\nthe hatching of the pupæ. We have already said that the first swarm is\r\nalways led by the old queen or mother, and that it starts before the\r\nhatching of the young females. If she had not gone out before their\r\nbirth she would have destroyed them, and the new hive would have been\r\nunable to re-organise itself for the want of a chief.\r\n\r\nThe first swarm having set out, those bees which remain in the hive\r\npay particular attention to the royal cells. If the young queens make\r\nefforts to escape from them, their guardians watch them narrowly, and\r\nas the prisoners destroy their covers of wax the guards restore them;\r\nbut as they do not desire the death of the inmates, they pass in some\r\nhoney through the opening before they close it, so as to ameliorate\r\ntheir captivity. At the appointed moment, the issue of the first egg\r\nlaid quits her cradle. Very soon she yields to the murderous instinct\r\nwhich impels her to destroy her rivals, so that she may reign with\r\nindividual sway over the community. She searches for the cells in\r\nwhich these are shut up, but the moment she approaches them the\r\nworkers pinch her, pull her about, drive her away, and oblige her to\r\nmove on, and, as the royal cells are numerous, she finds with\r\ndifficulty any corner in her hive where she may be at rest.\r\nIncessantly tormented by the desire of attacking the other females,\r\nand incessantly driven back by the guard, she becomes very much\r\nexcited, passes through the different groups of workers at a run, and\r\ncommunicates to them her agitation. She leads the inmates of the hive\r\nthe same sort of dance frequently in the course of the day.\r\n\r\nSometimes the young queen at the end of her attempts utters a shrill\r\nsong, analogous to that of the grasshopper. This song, so unusual\r\namong these insects, has the effect of petrifying the bees. So says\r\nFrancis Huber, speaking of a queen which had just been hatched, and\r\nwhich was trying in vain to satisfy her jealous instincts. \"She sang,\"\r\nsays he, \"twice. When we saw her producing this sound, she was\r\nmotionless, her thorax rested against the honeycomb, her wings being\r\ncrossed on her back, and she moved them about without un-crossing\r\nthem, and without opening them. Whatever cause it was that made her\r\nchoose this attitude, the bees seemed affected by it, all of them now\r\nlowered their heads and remained motionless. Next day the hive\r\npresented the same appearances, there remained still twenty-three\r\nroyal cells, which were all assiduously guarded by a great number of\r\nbees. The moment the queen approached these, all the guards were in a\r\nstate of agitation, surrounded her, bit her, hustled her in every way,\r\nand generally finished by driving her off; sometimes when this\r\nhappened she sang, resuming the attitude which I just now described;\r\nfrom that moment the bees became motionless.\"[91] But the fever which\r\nhad seized on the young queen ended by communicating itself to her\r\nsubjects, and, at a particular moment, a new swarm set out under her\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\n    [91] \"Observations sur les Abeilles,\" tome i., p. 265.\r\n\r\nWhen the emigration is effected, the workers which had remained at\r\nhome set free another female. This one acts in the same way as the\r\nfirst. She tries to get at her rivals still imprisoned, and whom she\r\ncan smell in their cradles; but the guards repel her with vigour,\r\nand defeat all her attempts, till she makes up her mind to emigrate\r\nwith a new swarm. This curious scene is repeated, with the same\r\ncircumstances, three or four times in the space of a fortnight, if the\r\nweather is favourable, and the hive well peopled. In the end, the\r\nnumber of bees is so much reduced, that they can no longer keep such\r\nvigilant guard round the royal cells, and it then happens that two\r\nfemales come out together from their cradles. Immediately the two\r\nrivals look for each other, and fight, and the queen that comes\r\nvictorious out of this duel to the death reigns peaceably over the\r\npeople she has won for herself. If, in the tumult which precedes the\r\nswarming, a female escapes from her prison, it may happen that she is\r\ncarried away in the swarm. In this case the deserters divide into two\r\nseparate bands, but the weakest in numbers are not long in breaking\r\nup, the deserters going to swell the principal swarm. At last all the\r\ntroop is reunited, and it then contains two queens. As long as the\r\nswarm remains fixed on its branch, all passes quietly, in spite of the\r\npresence of a second queen. But as soon as it has become domiciled,\r\nthe affair becomes serious; a duel to the death takes place between\r\nthe two aspirants to the command. Two queens cannot exist in the same\r\nhive. One of them is _de trop_ and must be got rid of.\r\n\r\nFrancis Huber was the first to describe these duels between the\r\nqueens. We quote an interesting account which he has left us of a\r\ncombat which he watched on the 12th of May, 1790:--\"Two young queens,\"\r\nsays he, \"came out on that day from the cells almost at the same\r\nmoment, in one of our smallest hives. As soon as they saw each other\r\nthey dashed one against the other with every appearance of the\r\ngreatest rage, and put themselves in such a position that each one had\r\nits antennæ seized between the teeth of its rival; the head, the\r\nthorax, and abdomen of the one were opposite to the head, the thorax,\r\nand abdomen of the other; they had only to bend round the posterior\r\nextremity of their bodies, and they would reciprocally have stabbed\r\neach other with their darts, and both engaged in the combat would have\r\nbeen killed. But it seems as if Nature would not allow this duel to\r\nend by the death of both of the combatants. One would say that she had\r\nordained that those queens, finding themselves in this position (that\r\nis to say, face to face and abdomen to abdomen), should retreat that\r\nvery instant with the greatest precipitation. And so, as soon as the\r\ntwo rivals felt that their posterior parts were about to meet, they\r\nleft go of each other, and each one ran away in an opposite\r\ndirection.... A few minutes after they had separated from each other\r\ntheir fear ceased, and they recommenced looking for each other. Very\r\nsoon they perceived the object of their search, and we saw them\r\nrunning one against the other. They seized each other, as at the\r\nfirst, and put themselves in exactly the same position. The result was\r\nthe same; as soon as their abdomens approached each other they only\r\nthought of getting free, and ran away. The working bees were very much\r\nagitated during the whole of this time, and their tumult seemed to\r\nincrease when the two adversaries separated from each other. We saw\r\nthem on two different occasions stop the queens in their flight, seize\r\nthem by the legs, and keep them prisoners for more than a minute. At\r\nlast, in a third attack, the queen which was the most infuriated or\r\nthe strongest, rushed upon her rival at a moment when she did not see\r\nher coming; seized her with her jaws by the base of her wing, then\r\nmounted on to her body, and brought the extremity of her abdomen over\r\nthe last rings of her enemy, whom she was then able to pierce with her\r\nsting very easily. She then let go the wing which she held between her\r\nteeth, and drew back her dart. The vanquished queen dragged herself\r\nheavily along, lost her strength, and expired soon afterwards.\"[92]\r\n\r\n    [92] \"Observations sur les Abeilles,\" tome i., pp. 174-178.\r\n\r\nThese singular combats take place between young maiden queens. Francis\r\nHuber, by introducing into a hive some queens from other hives\r\nconvinced himself that the same animosity impels the females which are\r\npregnant to fight with and destroy each other. From the moment when\r\nthe young queen to whom the sovereignty has fallen is pregnant, she is\r\nanxious to destroy all the royal pupæ which still exist in the hive,\r\nand which are then given up to her without resistance by the workers.\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Ouk agathon polykoiraniê. heis koioanos hestô,\r\n  Eis basileus....][93]\r\n\r\n    [93] \"Many ruling together is not good: let there be one\r\n    ruler, one king.\"--_Homer's \"Iliad,\"_ ii. 110.\r\n\r\nBecome a mother, the female attacks one after the other the cells\r\nwhich still contain females. She may be seen to throw herself with\r\nfury on the first cell she comes to. She makes an opening in it with\r\nher mandibles large enough to allow her to introduce her abdomen, and\r\nthen turns herself about till she has succeeded in giving a stab with\r\nher sting to the female which it contains. She then withdraws, highly\r\nsatisfied with what she has done. The working bees, who up to this\r\nmoment have remained indifferent spectators of her efforts, take upon\r\nthemselves the rest of the business. They set to work to enlarge the\r\nhole made by the ruling queen, and to draw out the carcase of the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the fierce and jealous sovereign throws herself on\r\nanother cell, and breaks into it with violence. If she does not find\r\nin it a perfect insect, but only a pupa, she does not condescend to\r\nmake use of her royal weapon. The workers take on themselves to empty\r\nthe cell and destroy its contents. These executions over, the queen\r\ncan for the future occupy herself in laying, without having anything\r\nto fear from rivals. Let us remark, in passing, that man is not much\r\nbehind these insects whose savage exploits in cruelty we have just\r\nrelated. Among certain tribes of Ethiopians the first care of the\r\nnewly-crowned chief is to put in prison all his brothers, so as to\r\nprevent wars by pretenders to the throne. Delivered from all dread of\r\nrivals, our queen sets to work with an indefatigable zeal; and the\r\nworkers, animated by the hope of a numerous progeny, heap up\r\nprovisions around them.\r\n\r\nBut now a new tragedy is about to be enacted. The drones, that is to\r\nsay, the males, are now no longer wanted in the colony: their mission\r\nis over. By an inexorable law of Nature they must be got rid of, and\r\nthe working bees proceed to make general massacre of them. It is in\r\nthe months of July and August that this frightful carnage takes place.\r\nThe workers may be seen furiously giving chase to the males, and\r\npursuing them to the extremity of the hive, where these unfortunate\r\ninsects seek a place of safety. Three or four workers dash off in the\r\npursuit after a male. They seize hold of him, pull him by his legs, by\r\nhis wings, by his antennæ, and kill him with their stings. This\r\npitiless massacre includes even the larvæ and pupæ of the males. The\r\nexecutioners drag them from their cells, run them through with their\r\nstings, greedily suck the liquids contained in their bodies, and then\r\ncast their remains to the winds. This slaughter goes on for many days,\r\ncontinuing till the males have been completely got rid of, they not\r\nbeing able to defend themselves, as they have no stings.\r\n\r\nThey are allowed to live, however, when they are fortunate enough to\r\ninhabit a hive deprived of its queen. There they even find a place of\r\nperfect safety when they have been driven out of another hive, and may\r\nbe met with in this refuge until the month of January. In like manner\r\nthe lives of the males are spared in those hives which, instead of a\r\ntrue queen, have only a female half impregnated, which lays only male\r\neggs; but a hive of this kind, whose active population cannot be\r\nincreased, ends by being abandoned by its inhabitants. The sterility\r\nor absence of the queen entails the dissolution of the society. She\r\nis, in fact, the life and soul of the hive; and without her there is\r\nno hope, no courage, no activity. The populace, abandoned to itself,\r\nfalls into anarchy. Famine, pillage, ruin, and death are at its doors.\r\nHaving no progeny to set their hopes on, the bees live from one day to\r\nanother without a care for the morrow. They leave off working, and\r\nlive entirely on theft and rapine, and at last they disappear\r\nentirely. It is a society become rotten and broken up for the want of\r\na moral tie.\r\n\r\nIf the loss of the mother bee takes place at a period at which there\r\nstill exist in the hive some larvæ of working bees of less than three\r\ndays old, the nurse (as we have already said) adopt some of these\r\nlarvæ, and make them into queens by means of the physical education\r\nand special nourishment which they give them. In this case, then, the\r\nevil can be repaired; the workers themselves find a remedy without\r\nassistance. But if the hive possesses a degenerate queen, which only\r\nlays male eggs, the intervention of man is necessary to save it, by\r\nthe substitution of a properly impregnated queen. If, indeed, a\r\nstrange queen wished to penetrate alone into a hive already containing\r\na sovereign, she would infallibly be stopped at the door and stifled\r\nby the sentinels who guard the entrance to the hive. These would\r\nsurround her immediately, and keep her captive under them till she\r\nperished, either through suffocation or hunger. They do not employ\r\ntheir stings against an intruding queen, except in the case of an\r\nattempt being made to deliver her from their clutches: they get rid of\r\nher by stifling.\r\n\r\nWhen it is wished to introduce into a hive a stranger queen, after\r\nhaving removed the original sovereign, many precautions must be used\r\nbefore putting her into the common home. It is only after some time\r\nthat the bees become aware of the disappearance of their queen; but\r\nthey then manifest great emotion. They run hither and thither, as\r\nthough mad, leaving off their work, and making a peculiar buzzing\r\nsound. If you return to them their original sovereign, they recognise\r\nher, and calm is immediately restored; but the substitution of a new\r\nqueen for the original sovereign does not produce the same effect in\r\nevery case. If you introduce the new queen half a day only after the\r\nremoval of the old queen, she is very badly received, and is at once\r\nsurrounded, the workers trying to suffocate her. Generally she sinks\r\nunder this bad treatment. But if you allow a longer interval to elapse\r\nbefore you introduce the substitute, the bees, rendered more tractable\r\nby the delay, are better disposed towards her. If you allow an\r\ninterregnum of twenty-four hours, the stranger queen is always\r\nreceived with the honours due to her rank, a general buzzing\r\nannouncing the event to the whole population of the hive. They assign\r\nto their adopted queen a train of picked attendants; they draw up in\r\nline on her passing by; they caress her with the tips of their\r\nantennæ; they offer her honey. A little joyful fluttering of the\r\nescort announces that every one in the little republic is satisfied.\r\nThe labours out of doors and indoors then begin anew with more\r\nactivity than ever.\r\n\r\nIt is principally during stormy days, when the heat and the\r\nelectricity in the air are favourable to the secretion of pollen in\r\nplants, that the bees go into the fields to make their harvest. They\r\nheap up provisions in the hive against the cold season, not\r\nforgetting, however, to watch over the eggs, their future hope, \"spem\r\ngentis,\" as Virgil calls them.\r\n\r\nThese peaceful occupations are sometimes interrupted by the dire\r\nnecessities of war. It happens that the bees of an impoverished hive,\r\nimpelled by hunger, that bad counsellor, make up their mind to attack\r\nand to pillage the treasures of a neighbouring hive which is\r\nabundantly stocked with provisions. A savage fight then takes place\r\nbetween the two battalions. Each one precipitates itself with fury\r\nupon its adversary. Two bees press against and bite each other till\r\none is overcome. The victor springs upon the back of the vanquished,\r\nsqueezes it round the neck with its mandibles, and pierces it between\r\nthe rings of its abdomen with its sting. The victorious bee places\r\nitself by the side of its fallen enemy, and resting on four of its\r\nlegs, rubs its two hind ones together proudly, as a sign of supreme\r\ntriumph. Réaumur relates a strange fact, which he says he often\r\nobserved, and which proves that the insects we are treating of do not\r\nfight to satisfy a sanguinary and savage instinct, but (which is less\r\nreprehensible) to satisfy their hunger. Bees attacked by a superior\r\nforce are in no danger of losing their lives if their enemies can\r\ninduce them to give up their throats--that expression conveys the\r\nidea. Supposing three or four are furiously attacking one bee: they\r\nare pulling it by its legs and biting it on its thorax. The\r\nunfortunate object of this attack has then nothing better to do, to\r\nescape alive from such a perilous situation, than to stretch out its\r\ntrunk laden with sweet-scented honey. The plunderers will come one\r\nafter the other and drink the honey; then, cloyed, satisfied, having\r\nnothing more to demand, they go their way, leaving the bee to return\r\nto his dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nThere are also strange fights--regular duels--between the bees of the\r\nsame hive. Very hot weather has the effect of irritating them, and\r\nmaking them boil over with rage. They are then dangerous to man, whom\r\nthey attack boldly. But more often it is amongst themselves that they\r\nquarrel. One often sees two bees which meet seize each other by the\r\nneck in the air. It happens also that a bee, in a state of fury,\r\nthrows itself on another who is walking quietly and unsuspiciously\r\nalong the edge of its hive. When two bees are struggling in this\r\nmanner they descend to the ground, for in the air they would not be\r\nable to get purchase enough to be sure of striking each other. They\r\nthen engage in a hand-to-hand fight, as the gladiators used formerly\r\nto do in the circus. They are continually making stabs with their\r\nstings, but almost always the point slips over the scales with which\r\nthey are covered. The combat is sometimes prolonged during an hour,\r\nbefore one of them has found the weak point in the other's natural\r\ncuirass, and has buried its terrible weapon in the flesh. The victor\r\noften leaves its sting in the wound which it has made, and then dies,\r\nin its moment of triumph, through the loss of this organ. Sometimes\r\nthe two combatants, in spite of long and savage assaults, cannot\r\nsucceed in injuring either's solid armour. In such a case they leave\r\neach other, tired of war, and fly away, despairing of obtaining a\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAt the end of autumn, when the bees no longer find any flowers in the\r\nfields to plunder, they finish rearing their eggs on the pollen, which\r\nthey keep in store, and the queen ceases to lay. Numbed by the cold of\r\nthe winter, the workers cease to go out. Crowded together they\r\nmutually warm each other, and thus hold out, when the cold is not too\r\nintense, against the rigour of the frosts. Huddled up between the\r\ncakes of the honeycomb, they wait for the return of fine weather, to\r\nrecommence their labours at home and abroad. After two or three years\r\nof this laborious existence the bee dies, but to live again in a\r\nnumerous posterity, as Virgil says:--\r\n\r\n  \"At genus immortale manet, multosque per annos\r\n  Stat fortuna domus, et avi numerantur avorum!\"\r\n\r\nThere has been a good deal of discussion on the question whether bees\r\nconstitute monarchies or republics. According to our opinion, theirs\r\nis a true republic. As all the population is the issue of a common\r\nmother, and as each bee of the female sex can become a queen--that is\r\nto say, a mother-bee, if it receives an appropriate nourishment--it is\r\nmanifest that the title of queen has been wrongly given to the\r\nmother-bee. After all, she is nothing more than president of a\r\nrepublic. The vice-presidents, as we have already pointed out, are all\r\nthose females which at any given moment may be called by choice--that\r\nis, by popular election--to fulfil the functions of the sovereign,\r\nwhen death or accident has put an end to her existence. \"There is no\r\nsuch thing as a king in Nature,\" said Daubenton one day, in one of his\r\nlectures at the Jardin des Plantes. The audience immediately\r\napplauded, and cried \"Bravo!\" The honest _savant_ stopped, quite\r\ndisconcerted, and asked his assistant naturalist the cause of this\r\napplause, perhaps ironical. \"I must have said something stupid,\"\r\nrepeated poor Daubenton between his teeth, remembering the saying of\r\nPhocion under similar circumstances. \"No,\" replied his assistant\r\nnaturalist, \"you have said nothing but what is quite true; but,\r\nwithout meaning it, you have made a political allusion. You spoke\r\nagainst kings, and our young republicans thought that you were\r\nalluding to Louis XVI.\" \"Indeed,\" said the coadjutor of Buffon, \"I had\r\nno idea that I was talking politics!\" The bee republic, this little\r\nanimal society, is admirably constituted, and all its citizens obey\r\nits laws with docility.\r\n\r\nBees have often served as an example, proving, according to some, the\r\nmarvellous intelligence of certain little animals; according to\r\nothers, an insect wonderfully developed. For ourselves, we have never\r\nwell understood what people mean by the word _instinct_; and we\r\nfrankly grant to the bee intelligence, as we do also to many animals.\r\nThe greater number of the acts of their life seem to be the result of\r\nan idea, a mental deliberation, a determination come to after\r\nexamination and reflection. The construction of their cells, always\r\nuniform, is, they say, the result of instinct. However, it happens\r\nthat under particular circumstances, these little architects know how\r\nto abandon the beaten track of routine, reserving to themselves the\r\npower of returning, when it is useful to do so, to the traditional\r\nprinciples which ensure the beauty and regularity of their\r\nconstructions. Bees have been seen, indeed, to deviate from their\r\nordinary habits in order to correct certain irregularities--the result\r\nof accident or produced by the intervention of man--which had deranged\r\ntheir works.\r\n\r\nFrancis Huber relates that he saw bees propping up with pillars and\r\nflying buttresses of wax a piece of the honeycomb which had fallen\r\ndown. At the same time, put on their guard by this sad accident, they\r\nset to work to fortify the principal framework of the other combs, and\r\nto fasten them more securely to the roof of the hive. This took place\r\nin the month of January, and therefore not during the working season,\r\nand when to provide against a distant eventuality was the only\r\nquestion. M. Waland has reported an analogous observation. Is there\r\nnot here, in the first place, a true and excellent reasoning, then an\r\nact, an operation, a work, executed as the result of this reasoning?\r\nNow, an operation which is performed as the result of reasoning, is\r\nattributable to intelligence. Again, the bees give different sorts of\r\nfood to the different sorts of larvæ. They know how to change this\r\nfood when an accident has deprived the hive of its queen, and it is\r\nnecessary to replace her; this is another proof of intelligence.\r\n\r\nBut it is, above all, in the face of an enemy that the intellectual\r\nfaculties of these insects show themselves. There are always at the\r\nentrance of every hive three or four bees, which have nothing else to\r\ndo but to guard the door, to keep a watch over incomers and outgoers,\r\nand to prevent an enemy or an intruder from slipping into the\r\ncommunity. When one of them perceives an enemy on the borders of the\r\nhive, it dashes forwards towards it, and by a menacing and significant\r\nbuzzing warns it to retire. If it does not understand the warning,\r\nwhich is a rare occurrence--for men, horses, dogs, and animals of all\r\nkinds know perfectly well the danger to which they expose themselves\r\nby approaching too near a hive in full operation[94]--the bee gets a\r\nreinforcement, and very soon returns to the combat with a determined\r\nbattalion. All this is, it seems to us, intelligence.\r\n\r\n    [94] The bee's sting may lead to very serious consequences. It\r\n    often happens that large animals, such as horses or oxen, tied\r\n    up in the neighbourhood of a beehive, and which have disturbed\r\n    the bees, die in consequence of stings received from them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323.--Sentinel Bees guarding the entrance to the\r\nhive.]\r\n\r\nWe have just said that there are sentinels at the entrance of every\r\nhive. They touch with their antennæ each individual that wishes to\r\npenetrate into the house. Hornets, the Death's-head Sphinx, slugs,\r\n&c., often try to introduce themselves into the hive. In that case, on\r\nthe appeal of the watchful porters, all the bees combine their efforts\r\nto defend the entrance to their habitation. It would be impossible for\r\nthem, in fact, to stop the ravages of their enemies when once entered\r\ninto the interior. When a sphinx has succeeded in introducing itself\r\ninto a hive, it sits down and drinks the honey in great bumpers,\r\ndevouring all the provisions: and the unfortunate proprietors of the\r\nhouse are obliged to emigrate. To stop the entrance of moths which fly\r\nby night, the bees contract, and sometimes barricade, their door with\r\na mixture of wax and propolis. When a slug or any other large animal\r\nhas managed to introduce itself into the interior, they kill it and\r\nwrap it up in a shroud of propolis, as we have already related.\r\n\r\nHowever, they are quite helpless against certain microscopic parasites\r\nwhich sometimes attack them. The bee-louse, which has been described\r\nand drawn by Réaumur in one of his Memoirs,[95] and the parasite which\r\nwas described in 1866 by M. Duchemin, the _Sugar Acarus_, which is\r\nfound in the liquid honey of those hives which are attacked by the\r\ndisease called the rot (_pourriture_), are the most serious enemies of\r\nthe bee. The _Gallerias_ are also terrible enemies to them. Every hive\r\nthus attacked is ruined. These destructive insects attack also the\r\nwild bees, drive them from their nests, and destroy the wax of the\r\ncakes forming the comb. The _Galleria_ impudently makes his home in\r\nthe houses of bees, wild as well as domesticated.\r\n\r\n    [95] Tome v., planche 36.\r\n\r\nThe habits of bees in their wild state, which make their nests in the\r\ntrunks of trees and other cavities, do not differ from those of\r\ndomesticated bees. Only the latter become tame with man, getting used\r\nto those who look after them, and becoming less aggressive towards\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nApiculture, or bee-keeping, is still at the present day an important\r\nbusiness, although honey has lost a great deal of its utility since\r\nthe introduction of sugar into Europe. Without entering into many\r\ndetails on apiculture, that is to say, on the attention it is\r\nnecessary to pay to bees, we will mention the principal duties of the\r\nbee-keeper.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the spring, the bees _font la barbe_ (as the French say),\r\nthat is, when they are getting ready to swarm, one must watch\r\nnarrowly, so as not to lose them. As soon as a swarm has settled on a\r\ntree or on any artificial resting-place prepared on purpose in the\r\nneighbourhood, it is approached, after having covered one's face with\r\na piece of transparent linen or canvas, or with a hood, and the\r\ncluster is caused to fall into a hive turned upside down. The hive is\r\nthen turned up and again put in its place; or else, if it is only to\r\nserve for the conveyance of the swarm to another place, shaken about\r\nbefore the door of the hive which the swarm is destined to occupy. The\r\nbees then beat to arms, and set to work to enter their new habitation\r\nin a compact column. Fig. 324 represents the manner in which one ought\r\nto proceed in order to gather a swarm of bees, which is fixed on a\r\nbranch of a tree, and introduce it into the hive prepared for it. Let\r\nus listen on this subject to an experienced bee-keeper, M. Hamet: \"As\r\nsoon as a swarm has fixed itself anywhere, and there are only a few\r\nbees fluttering round the cluster, you must make your preparations for\r\nlodging them in a hive you have got ready for the purpose. Some people\r\nrub the hive on the inside with aromatic plants or honey, with the\r\nobject of making the bees fix themselves there more surely. This\r\nprecaution is not indispensable. What is essential is, that the hive\r\nshould be clean, and free from any bad smell. It is a good thing to\r\npass it beforehand over the flame of a straw fire, which destroys the\r\neggs of insects and insects themselves which may have lodged in it.\r\n\r\n\"After having covered your head with a veil, if the swarm has settled\r\nin a difficult place, and you are afraid of being stung, you hold the\r\nhive under the cluster of bees and make them fall into it, either by\r\nshaking the branch to which the swarm is attached, very hard, or by\r\nmeans of a small broom, or even with the hand, for then they very\r\nrarely sting: it is hardly ever necessary to take any precautions in\r\napproaching them, except for swarms which have been fixed for many\r\nhours, or since the day before. When the bees have fallen in a mass to\r\nthe bottom of the hive, you turn this gently over, and place it on a\r\npiece of linen stretched out on the ground near the place where the\r\nswarm was, or on a tray, or simply on the ground itself, if it is dry\r\nand clean. You will have taken care to place on this linen a little\r\nwedge, a stick or a stone, to raise the hive a little, and to leave\r\nroom through which the bees may enter. A great part of the bees which\r\nfall into the hive fix themselves on to its sides; but a good number\r\nare dropped on the linen when the hive is turned. This is the manner\r\nin which you act when it is determined to lodge the swarm; but when\r\nthe swarm is to be lodged in another hive, as we shall see farther on,\r\nimmediately that the bees recognise the lodging which is destined for\r\nthem, they set to work to beat to arms, and to enter in a compact\r\ncolumn their new dwelling; those which are fluttering about in the air\r\nare summoned by this call, and are not long in alighting on the spot\r\nwhere the rest of their companions are fixed. At the end of a quarter\r\nor half an hour, at the most, all, or nearly all, have entered the\r\nhive. A few still hover about round the place where the swarm was\r\nfixed. If the number is considerable, and if many have stopped in this\r\nplace, you must make them quit it by placing some offensive herb, such\r\nas celandine, horehound, field camomile, &c., on it, or project the\r\nsmoke of a rag upon them, which will drive away the bees and force\r\nthem to look for the colony or to return to the mother-hive. You may\r\nalso project smoke, but in moderate quantities, on the bees grouped\r\naround and on the borders of the lodging which you have just given\r\nthem, and which they will not be long in entering.\"[96]\r\n\r\n    [96] \"Cours d'Apiculture,\" pp. 73, 74.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324.--Taking a swarm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325.--Bell-shaped hive.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326.--English hive.]\r\n\r\nA good swarm weighs from four to six pounds; one pound contains about\r\nfour thousand bees. The second swarm weighs rarely more than two\r\npounds, and the third still less. You can also form artificial swarms\r\nby drawing off the bees of one hive into another, an operation which\r\nis easy with bell-shaped hives. A glance at Fig. 325, which represents\r\nthe common hive of the north of France, that is to say, the\r\n_bell-shaped_, will show how easy it is to effect that drawing off,\r\nor pouring out of the bees, by joining together at their bases two\r\nhives, the one empty, the other containing a swarm. In order to have\r\ncontrol over the bees during the operation, you must slightly stupefy\r\nthem with the smoke of a smouldering rag.\r\n\r\nBeehives are of a thousand different shapes, each of which has its\r\nparticular advantage. They are made of wood and of straw; and the\r\nshapes used in different countries are very various. We give as\r\nexamples, Figs. 325, 326, 327, 328, 329.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327.--Swiss hive.]\r\n\r\nThe site, that is, the place where hives stand, is not a matter of\r\nindifference. It is generally supposed that bees ought to be\r\nestablished in a place fully exposed to the sun, and to the greatest\r\nheat of the day. This is a mistake. M. de Frarière, in his work on\r\nbees and bee-keeping, recommends the hives to be placed under trees,\r\nin such a way that they may be kept in the shade. Fig. 330 shows the\r\nway in which M. de Frarière recommends hives to be arranged.\r\n\r\nDr. Monin, author of an interesting monograph of the bee, published in\r\n1866, after treating of the different arrangements which have been\r\nrecommended for hives, concludes thus:--\"It is to satisfy all these\r\nrequirements that experienced bee-keepers so much recommend for the\r\nhives an exposure to the ten o'clock sun; that is to say, that they\r\nshould be turned in such a manner that the sun may shine on their\r\nentrances when it has already attained a certain height above the\r\nhorizon, and sufficiently warmed the surrounding air for the bees,\r\nwhich the brightness of its rays has tempted forth, not to be seized\r\nwith cold and numbed before they have been able to return home\r\nagain.\"[97]\r\n\r\n    [97] \"Physiologie de l'Abeille, suivie de l'art de soigner et\r\n    d'exploiter les Abeilles d'après une methode simple et facile,\"\r\n    p. 94. Paris, 1866.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328.--Polish hive.]\r\n\r\nIn the month of March a gathering of wax is made by cutting away the\r\nlower part of the hives, where the cakes have grown old. The principal\r\nhoney harvest takes place towards the end of May, June, or July,\r\naccording to the place the hives are in. A larger or smaller gathering\r\ntakes place according to the quantity of honey ready, and the state of\r\nthe season. As the bees will not see the violation of their domicile\r\nand theft of their winter provisions without anger, to get possession\r\nof the honeycomb with which the hive is filled, you must put these\r\nirritable insects into such a state that they are unable to injure\r\nyou. They can be rendered peaceable by smoking them. The smoke is\r\nforced into the hive with the assistance of a pair of bellows, the\r\narrangement of which is shown in Fig. 331. If the fumigation is\r\nprolonged, the bees are very soon heard to beat their wings in a\r\npeculiar manner; they are then in what is called in French _l'état de\r\nbruissement_, or the roaring state. When they stand up on their hind\r\nlegs and agitate their wings, you can do with them almost anything you\r\nlike--cut away the honeycomb, abstract the eggs, or take out the\r\nhoney--without their troubling themselves about it. But this state of\r\nthings must not last too long, or you may suffocate your bees. It is a\r\nsort of anæsthesis into which the bees have been thrown; and, as with\r\nmen, this must not be prolonged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329.--Garden hive.]\r\n\r\nSome bee-keepers, in order to collect the honey harvest, suffocate\r\ntheir bees by burning sulphur matches. This is a bad practice. \"Those\r\nauthors who recommend us to suffocate the bees,\" says M. Hamet, \"under\r\nthe pretext that their colonies will become too numerous, and who\r\nadd, 'You cannot eat beef without killing the ox,' are more stupid\r\nthan the animal they have chosen for their comparison.\" A hive often\r\nproduces from twelve to twenty pounds of honey each year, and a\r\nproportional quantity of wax. It may, then, furnish to the bee-keeper\r\nan important revenue, especially as the rearing of bees gives scarcely\r\nany trouble, and involves scarcely any labour, as it is only necessary\r\nto select a spot with a proper exposure and well supplied with\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330.--Hives under the shade of trees.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331.--Bellows used to stupefy Bees].\r\n\r\nWe possess in Europe two species or races of bees--the Common Bee\r\n(_Apis mellifica_), and the Ligurian Bee (_Apis ligustica_), whose\r\nabdomen is tawny, with the rings bordered with black. It is this\r\nlatter species of which Virgil sang, and which is found in Italy and\r\nGreece. It has been remarked that the Ligurian bee pierces the\r\ncalices, at their bases, of those flowers which are too long for it to\r\npenetrate into easily, and thus gets possession of the honey, whilst\r\nthe common bees pass these flowers over. This observation proves that\r\nthe former is the more intelligent of the two races. In Egypt a bee is\r\nreared called the Banded Bee (_Apis fasciata_).\r\n\r\nTen or twelve other species of honey-bees exist in Senegal, the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, Madagascar, East Indies at Timor (_Apis Peronii_), &c.\r\nThe European bee has been acclimatised in America, but it soon returns\r\nto its wild state, as indeed do all our domestic animals when\r\ntransported to the other hemisphere. At the Cape of Good Hope the\r\nHottentots seek greedily after the nests of wild bees, a bird called\r\nthe Indicator guiding them in this chase. This bird is observed\r\nflitting about from tree to tree, making a little significant cry.\r\nThey have only then to follow this bird-informer, for it will not be\r\nlong in stopping before some hollow tree which contains a nest of\r\nbees. The Hottentots always acknowledge its services by leaving it a\r\npart of the booty.\r\n\r\nFenimore Cooper, the novelist, tells us, in his work entitled \"The\r\nPrairie,\" how the bee-hunters in America discover the wild hives. They\r\nplace on a plank, covered with white paint still moist, a piece of\r\nbread covered with sugar or honey. The bees, in plundering this bread,\r\nget some of the paint on their bodies, and are then more easily\r\ntracked when they return to their hives. In North America they are, as\r\nit were, the harbingers of civilisation. When the Indians perceive a\r\nswarm trying to establish themselves in the solitudes of their\r\nforests, they say to one another, \"The white man is approaching; he\r\nwill soon be here.\" True pioneers of civilisation, these insects seem\r\nto announce to the forests and deserts of the New World that the reign\r\nof Nature has passed away, and that now the social state has begun to\r\nplay its part--a part that will never end.\r\n\r\nThe bees peculiar to South America have no sting: these are the\r\n_Meliponas_. These (Fig. 332) are more compactly formed than our bees,\r\nhave a more hairy body, and are smaller in size. Very numerous in the\r\nvirgin forests, they make their nests in the hollows of trees. The wax\r\nproduced by them is brown, and of an indifferent quality. Under thick\r\nleaves of wax are found cakes, with hexagonal cells, containing the\r\nmales, females, and neuters. The cells of the larvæ are closed by the\r\nworkers, and the larvæ spin themselves a cocoon inside. All around\r\nthe cradles are large round cells, entirely different in form from the\r\ncradles, in which the honey is stored. It is probable that the males,\r\nthe workers, and the females, live together in great harmony, and even\r\nthat there is in each nest more than one female, for the absence of\r\nthe sting must prevent any combats. If a few cakes of the _Melipona's_\r\nhoneycomb are moved into the hollow of a tree, they always found there\r\na new colony. We may conclude from this that the workers procure for\r\nthemselves females whenever they want them by means of a special sort\r\nof food. The savage inhabitants of the American forests collect this\r\nhoney; but, with the carelessness of uncivilised man, they at the same\r\ntime destroy the nests of these precious insects. They have now begun\r\nto domesticate certain species of _Meliponas_, by introducing them\r\ninto earthen pots or wooden cases. These insects have been brought to\r\nEurope, but they have always perished in the first cold weather.\r\nDuring the summer of 1863 there was, in the Museum of Natural History\r\nof Paris, a nest of _Melipona scutellaris_ from Brazil, but it did not\r\nprosper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332.--A species of Melipona.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMBLE OR BUMBLE BEES.\r\n\r\nIf in the month of March one passes through the fields, which are\r\nbeginning to get green, or through the woods, still deprived of their\r\nleaves, there may be seen, hovering hither and thither, great hairy\r\ninsects, resembling gigantic bees. These are the females of a species\r\nof bee, called by the French \"bourdons,\" from the buzzing noise they\r\nproduce; and by us \"humble bees,\" probably from their German name\r\n\"hummel,\" given for the same reason. These females have been awakened\r\nby the spring sun. They examine the cavities of stones, the heaps of\r\nmoss, and the holes in banks, &c., seeking for a suitable spot to\r\nconstruct a nest for their progeny.\r\n\r\nThe humble bees are of the same family as the bees, whom they resemble\r\nin their organisation. Like them, they are divided into males,\r\nfemales, and neuters, or workers. But their companies only last a\r\nyear. At the end of autumn the whole population has become extinct,\r\nwith the exception of the pregnant females, which pass the winter in a\r\nstate of torpor at the bottom of some hole, where they wait till the\r\nspring to perpetuate their race. Their societies comprise generally\r\nonly a small number of individuals, from fifty to three hundred. They\r\nare of peaceful habits, their ephemeral existence beginning and ending\r\nwith the flower season.\r\n\r\nThe humble bees are known by their great size, their short, robust\r\nbody, encircled by bands of very bright colours, and by the noise they\r\nmake in flying. Their hind legs are armed with two spurs. The females\r\nand the workers have the same organisation for plundering flowers as\r\nthe bees have: they have similar trunks, and their legs are fitted\r\nwith brushes and baskets for gathering pollen. The males, like the\r\nmales of hive bees, have no sting. The greater number have their\r\ndwelling-places underground; others make their nests on the surface of\r\nthe soil, in the cracks of walls, in heaps of stones, &c. The former\r\nestablish themselves in cavities situated as far as half a yard\r\nunderground, and approached by a long narrow gallery. It is almost\r\nalways a solitary female who has been the architect of the nest. She\r\ncleans out the cavity she has chosen, makes it as smooth as possible,\r\nand lines it with leaves and moss, to embellish the subterranean house\r\nin which she is to pass nearly all her existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333.--Male Humble Bee.]\r\n\r\nThe Moss Humble Bee (_Bombus muscorum_), called also the _Carding\r\nBee_, chooses an excavation of very little depth in which to make its\r\nnest, or else itself undertakes the hollowing out of a hole in the\r\nground. It covers this with a dome of moss or dry herbs. But it does\r\nnot fly when transporting the moss, it drags it along the ground, with\r\nits back turned towards the nest. Having seized a packet of the moss,\r\nit sets to work to draw out the bits with its mandibles, and then\r\npushing them under its body, throws them in the direction of the nest\r\nby a sort of kick from its hind legs. Sometimes, towards the end of\r\nthe season, many humble bees are to be seen working in line. The first\r\nseizes the moss, and after having carded it, passes it under its body,\r\nand throws it to the second, which throws it on to the third, and so\r\non, up to the nest. When the materials are ready, the insect makes use\r\nof them to manufacture a sort of hemispherical lid, or covering,\r\nresembling felt, which shuts the nest in, and is lined with wax. If\r\nyou lift up this covering, or small dome, which it is not dangerous to\r\ndo, for humble bees are not very aggressive, you find beneath it a\r\nnest composed of a coarse comb.\r\n\r\nThe cells which compose the nest, and which are to receive the larvæ\r\nof the insect, are of an oval shape, and of a pale yellow or even of a\r\nblackish colour. Fig. 334 represents these cells. The wax of which\r\nthey are composed has none of the qualities of that of hive bees, but\r\nis soft, sticky, and brownish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334.--Cells from a Humble Bee's nest.]\r\n\r\nWhen the mother humble bee--which at first was alone and built her\r\nhouse single-handed--has made a certain number of cells, she seeks for\r\nhoney and pollen, and prepares a paste, which she deposits in the\r\nfuture cradles. She then lays six or seven eggs in each. The larvæ\r\nwhich come from them live in common, at the same table, under the same\r\ntent. The cell is at first only the size of a pea; it soon becomes too\r\nnarrow, splits and cracks, and requires to be enlarged and repaired\r\nmany times, a work of which our industrious insects acquit themselves\r\nwith a good deal of care and attention. Before passing into the pupa\r\nstate each larva spins for itself a shell or cocoon of very fine white\r\nsilk. It ceases to eat, remains at first rolled up, then expands\r\nitself little by little, and changes its skin after three days. It\r\npasses fifteen days in the pupa state in a quiescent condition. After\r\nthe normal time has elapsed for it to remain in its hiding-place, it\r\ndelivers itself from its mummy-like covering, with the help of the\r\nmother or the workers. The humble bee then appears, robust, and its\r\nbody covered with a greyish down.\r\n\r\nWhen the successive hatchings have furnished to the mother the\r\nreinforcement she is waiting for, the workers she has raised occupy\r\nthemselves in building new cells, and in raising the wall of enclosure\r\nwhich is to protect the nest. This wall, formed of wax, starts from\r\nthe base, and raises itself, like a vertical rampart, from every point\r\nin the circumference. They then surmount this by the first roof, which\r\nis flat, supported by some pillars, and in which they have left one or\r\ntwo irregular openings. The whole is finally protected by a\r\nhemispherical covering of moss, made into a sort of felt and lined\r\nwith wax. Fig. 335 represents, in its entirety, a nest of this humble\r\nbee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335.--Nest of the Moss Humble Bee (_Bombus\r\nmuscorum_).]\r\n\r\nThe workers also take their part in rearing the eggs. They bring the\r\npaste, which they slip into the cells to the larvæ by a small hole,\r\nwhich is shut immediately afterwards. Later, they again give their\r\nassistance in disengaging the pupæ from their envelopes. In short,\r\nthey make themselves generally useful; but they have one bad fault:\r\nthey are very fond of eating the eggs laid by the mother. They try to\r\nseize them as she deposits them, or drag them from the cells, and suck\r\ntheir contents. And so the mother is obliged to be incessantly\r\ndefending her eggs against the voracity of the workers, and to be\r\nconstantly on her guard, so as to be ready to drive away these\r\nmarauders from cells newly filled.\r\n\r\nWe owe to an English naturalist, Newport, the knowledge of another\r\ncurious fact relating to the laying of humble bees, which is the\r\nexpedient the females and the males have recourse to for hastening the\r\nhatching of the eggs. They place themselves, like fowls sitting on\r\ntheir eggs, over the cocoons containing the pupæ almost hatched. By\r\nbreathing quickly, these industrious insects raise the temperature of\r\ntheir bodies, and consequently that of the air in the cells. Thanks to\r\nthis supplementary heat, the metamorphosis of the pupæ is much\r\nhastened. Newport, by slipping miniature thermometers between the\r\ncocoons of the nymphs and the sitting humble bees, ascertained that\r\nthe temperature of the latter was about 34° C., whilst the temperature\r\nof the cocoons left to themselves was only 27° C.; that of the air in\r\nthe rest of the nest being only from 21° to 24° C. After many hours of\r\nincubation, at the same time natural and artificial, in which Art and\r\nNature are so closely allied, after the sitting insects have many\r\ntimes relieved one another, the young humble bees come out of their\r\ncells. They are at first soft, greyish, moist, and very susceptible to\r\ncold. But after a few hours they become stronger, and the yellow and\r\nblack bands with which their abdomens are surrounded begin to be\r\nmarked out. The spring laying produces exclusively workers. The\r\ngreatest abundance of eggs are laid in August and September. The\r\nlaying of the female eggs begins in July; that of the males follows\r\nsoon after.\r\n\r\nUntil autumn the humble bees are incessantly enlarging their nests,\r\nand multiplying their little pots of honey. Without accumulating a\r\ngreat stock of provisions, for which they have no occasion, they\r\nalways keep in reserve a quantity of pollen and honey for their daily\r\nwants. The cells in which the honey is stored differ very much in\r\nshape. Some species of humble bees give them long and narrow necks;\r\nothers, less _recherché_ in their style of construction, simply make\r\ncylindrical vases. There are among the humble bees races of artists\r\nand races of simple builders; the one construct with taste, the other\r\nonly seek the useful.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the humble bees cull honey from the flowers. At night\r\nthey enter their home; but a certain number take the liberty of\r\nsleeping out. Surprised by the arrival of night in the bottom of the\r\ncalyx of a sweetly-scented flower, they philosophically determine to\r\nsleep in the open air, lying on this perfumed bed, with the heaven as\r\ntheir canopy.\r\n\r\nThe coupling of the humble bees takes place towards the end of\r\nSeptember. It costs the males their life, as it does with the hive\r\nbees. The impregnated females do not lay till the following spring; it\r\nis they who, after the winter is passed, will become the mothers of\r\nnew generations. They will take the reins of the family when the\r\nmother who founded the colony, the males, as also the workers, shall,\r\naccording to the laws of Nature, have passed away. There are often, on\r\nthe other hand, some workers which, born in the spring, become\r\nfruitful, and lay the same year, but only the eggs of males. These\r\nbecome a butt for the jealousy of the reigning mother, who pursues\r\nthem with fury, and devours their eggs. These, however, have\r\nthemselves cruel hearts. Animated by a profound jealousy, they dispute\r\nthe occupancy of the cells savagely, so as to be able to lay a few\r\neggs in them, which are no sooner laid than they are destroyed by\r\ntheir savage sisters. However, they never make use of their stings in\r\nany of these attacks. The humble bee population is peaceful, even in\r\nits combats. After the first cold weather in autumn, all these\r\ninsects, as we have said, perish, except the pregnant females. These\r\nprivileged depositaries of the race, _spes altera domûs_, look for a\r\nplace of retreat, and there sleep till the following spring. Then they\r\nwake up and found new colonies, which continue the race.\r\n\r\nFor a long while were confounded with the humble bees certain insects\r\nwhich have the same appearance, that is to say, a hairy body, with\r\nbands of various colours, but whose hind legs are adapted neither for\r\ngathering honey nor for building. These are the genus _Psithyrus_: it\r\nwas Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau who discovered their true position.\r\nThese are parasites, and only consist of males and fertile females,\r\nwithout workers. They lay their eggs in the nest of the humble bee.\r\nThey are, indeed, so like their hosts, that they can introduce\r\nthemselves into their dwellings without raising any suspicion. The\r\nhumble bees admit them freely, and receive them as if they belonged to\r\nthe family; so much so, indeed, that the poor humble bees themselves\r\nbring up the larvæ of these impudent guests. In the Order Hymenoptera\r\none meets with many examples of these sorts of parasites, which instal\r\ntheir progeny in the nest of another insect, as the cuckoo does in the\r\nnests of other birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLITARY BEES.\r\n\r\nWe have up till now found the insects of the great family of bees\r\ncollected together in perfectly organised societies. But there are a\r\ngreat number of species of this family which live alone. We will\r\nbriefly mention the most interesting of them.\r\n\r\nThe females of the solitary bees are impregnated like those of the\r\nhumble bees, and lay in spring, after having passed the winter asleep.\r\nThey build a nest divided into cells, fill it with eggs, and with a\r\nhonied paste shut it up, and die, without having seen their progeny\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 336, 337, 338.--Anthophora parietina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339.--Carpenter Bee, Pupæ, Eggs, Galleries, and\r\nNests.]\r\n\r\nThe _Anthophoras_ (Figs. 336, 337, 338) resemble bees, but they are\r\nmore hairy, and of greyish colour. Their nest, composed of earth\r\ntempered and agglutinated with their saliva, is made in the cracks of\r\nold walls or in the ground. It has the form of a twisted tube, and is\r\ndivided, by partitions, into compartments, each of which is to receive\r\na larva. Each insect, when hatched, pierces its own wall, and profits\r\nby the hole of exit of the brother which preceded it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340.--Mason Bee and Nest.]\r\n\r\nThese insects do not live together in societies. Indifferent\r\nneighbours, they do not lend each other mutual assistance. They have\r\ntheir parasites, the _Melactas_, like the humble bees. These parasites\r\nare hairy, blackish insects, spotted with white, laying their eggs in\r\nthe nests of the _Anthophoras_, which permit them to do so, and, at\r\nthe expense of their own progeny, bring up the intruder's little ones.\r\n\r\nThe Carpenter Bee, or Wood-piercer (_Xylocopa_), hollows out\r\ngalleries in decayed wood, and builds in them cells placed one over\r\nthe other--a work often occupying many weeks. She then furnishes the\r\nbottom of the cell with pollen mixed up with honey, lays an egg in the\r\nmiddle of this paste, and closes the cell by a ceiling of saw-dust\r\nagglutinated with saliva. On this ceiling she establishes a new cell,\r\nand so on, right up to the orifice, which she closes in the same\r\nmanner. Réaumur is astonished, with reason, at the admirable instinct\r\nwhich makes this provident mother determine the exact quantity of\r\nnourishment which will be necessary for its larva. When this has\r\nabsorbed all its provisions, it alone quite fills up its cell, and\r\nchanges into a pupa. It is worthy of remark, that the head of the\r\nyoung is always turned downwards, in such a way that it is by the\r\nbottom of its cell that it comes out. The bottom of the first is very\r\nnear the surface of the wood, so that the insect it encloses has only\r\na thin layer of wood to pierce through in order to set itself free.\r\nEach one of those which are born next has only to pierce the floor of\r\nits hiding-place to find the road before it free. The _Xylocopæ_ pass\r\nthe winter in the pupa state, and the perfect insects, with wings of a\r\nbeautiful metallic violet, appear in the spring, but are not found in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341.--Interior of the Nest of the Mason Bee.]\r\n\r\nOther solitary bees have their hind legs unsuited for the gathering of\r\npollen, but have the rings of the abdomen furnished with hairs for\r\nthat purpose. Such are the Mason Bees of Réaumur, belonging to the\r\ngenera _Osmia_ and _Chalicodoma_,[98] which build their nests against\r\nwalls with tempered earth, which become very hard.\r\n\r\n    [98] At a meeting of the Entomological Society of London, Feb.\r\n    18th, 1867, Mr. Newman exhibited the lock of a door, one of\r\n    several which in 1866 were found at the Kent Waterworks,\r\n    Deptford, to be completely filled and choked up with nests of\r\n    _Osmia Bicornis_: a portion of the nest had been forced out by\r\n    the insertion of the key. The locks were in pretty constant\r\n    use, so that the nests must have been built in the course of a\r\n    few days.--_Journal of Proceedings of the Entomological Society\r\n    of London_, 1867, lxxvi.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342.--Rose Megachile (_Megachile centuncularis_).]\r\n\r\nThese nests (Figs. 340 and 341) are filled with cells of oblong form\r\narranged irregularly. At first sight they might be taken for little\r\nlumps of earth plastered against the wall. When the perfect insect\r\nemerges, it is obliged to soften the mortar with its saliva, and to\r\nremove it, grain by grain, with its mandibles. The nests of\r\n_Chalicodomas_ are common in the environs of Paris, on walls of rough\r\nstones exposed to the south. They are often to be found in the parks\r\nof Meudon, of Conflans, of Vésinet, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Leaf-cutting Bees (_Megachile_) are not less worthy of remark in\r\ntheir habits. These insects make their nests in tubes lined with the\r\nleaves of the rose, the willow, the lilac, &c., placed in a\r\ncylindrical burrow. Each nest contains generally from three to six\r\ncells, separated by partitions of leaves. They cut off the pieces of\r\nleaves they require with their mandibles, the notches being\r\nwonderfully cleanly cut, as if they had been done with a punch.\r\n\r\nThey make as many as eight or ten envelopes in succession with the\r\nleaves, which, as they get dry, contract, keeping, however, the form\r\ngiven to them by the insect. The cells destined to receive the eggs\r\nacquire thus a certain solidity. Fig. 342 represents the nest of the\r\nMegachile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343.--Gallery of an _Andrena_.]\r\n\r\nThe Upholsterer Bees (_Anthocopas_) line their nests with the petals\r\nof flowers, as, for example (_Papaver rhæas_), the corn-poppy. Their\r\nburrows are made perpendicularly in the beaten earth of roads, and\r\neach contains one solitary cell, lined with portions of petals. When\r\nthe egg has been laid at the bottom of this cell, the bee fills up the\r\nrest of the hole with earth, to hide it from notice.\r\n\r\nThe Mining Bees (_Andrenæ_) hollow out in the ground tubular galleries\r\n(Fig. 343). They are not larger than ordinary flies. A great number of\r\nother bees are known, but their habits are little understood, and we\r\nshall not occupy ourselves about them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASPS.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the wasps as a race of dangerous brigands which live by\r\nrapine, are incessantly fighting battles, and which exist only to do\r\nharm. However, wasps, like Figaro, are better than they are reputed to\r\nbe. Their societies are admirably organised; their nests are models of\r\nindustry and artistic fancy. They have even certain domestic virtues\r\nwhich deserve our esteem; only they are an excitable race it is well not\r\nto cross. If great heat adds to their natural irritability, they\r\nsavagely attack those who annoy them, and pursue them to a distance. No\r\none, indeed, is ignorant that their sting is very painful. In cold\r\nweather, and towards night, they are less vivacious and less to be\r\ndreaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344.--Wasp's Nest.]\r\n\r\nThe wasps are distinguished from the bees by a decided characteristic.\r\nIn a state of repose they fold together their upper wings, which then\r\nseem very narrow, only spreading them out when they are about to fly;\r\nwhilst the latter when at rest keep their upper wings spread out.\r\n\r\nWasps live in companies, which last only a year, and are composed of\r\nmales, females, and workers. But the female wasp does not pass her\r\nentire life in idleness as a queen, like the mother hive bee. She\r\noccupies herself in making the nest and in taking care of the young,\r\nlike the mother humble bee. The males have also their duties. They\r\nwatch over the cleanliness of the habitation, and are the sanitary\r\ncommissioners and undertakers to the city. These are easily recognised\r\nby their oblong bodies, having so slight a connection with the thorax,\r\nas it were by a thread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345.--Common Wasp (_Vespa vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346.--Bush Wasp (_Vespa norvegica_).]\r\n\r\nTheir sting is larger than that of the bees, and is supplied with\r\npoison from a pouch placed at its base. The males have no sting. Wasps\r\ndo not secrete wax. With their mandibles they scrape wood and plants,\r\nthe fragments of which they agglutinate together in such a way as to\r\nform a tough cardboard. Thus, they invented the manufacture of paper\r\nlong before men. Charles de Geer, in his celebrated work, sums up the\r\nhabits of these insects in the following manner:--\"Wasps,\" says he,\r\n\"are, like bees, fond of sweets and honey, although they rarely seek\r\nthem in flowers; but their principal food consists in matters of quite\r\na different kind, such as fruits of all kinds, raw flesh, and live\r\ninsects, which they seize and devour. They sometimes do dreadful\r\ndamage in bee-hives, devouring the honey, and killing the bees. They\r\ndo not gather wax; their nests and their combs are composed of a\r\nmatter resembling grey paper, which they get from rotten wood, and\r\nwhich they scrape off with their jaws; they make a sort of paste of\r\nthese scrapings by moistening them with a certain liquid which they\r\ndisgorge. The cells in the combs are hexagonal, and very regular, like\r\nthose of bees.\"[99]\r\n\r\n    [99] \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes,\" tome\r\n    ii., p. 765. In 4to. Stockholm, 1771.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347.--The Hornet (_Vespa crabro_).]\r\n\r\nWasps collect the materials with which they build near the place where\r\nthey have chosen to establish their domicile. These materials are\r\nligneous fibre, mixed up with saliva, with the aid of which these\r\ninsects prepare the paper-like substance, which is very tough, and\r\ndestined to form the walls of the cells and their exterior covering.\r\nThe greater number make their habitation in the ground. Of these is\r\nour Common Wasp (_Vespa vulgaris_), which is black, agreeably\r\ncontrasted with bright yellow. The Bush Wasp (_Vespa norvegica_),\r\nwhich inhabits woods, constructs its nest between the branches of\r\nshrubs or bushes. It is smaller than the common species. The Hornet is\r\nthe largest European species of the family of the _Vespidæ_. The\r\nsubstance of its nest is yellowish, and very fragile, and is\r\nconstructed under a roof, in a loft, or in the hole of an old wall,\r\nbut most often in the hollow of a decayed tree. Another species of\r\nthis family (_Polistes gallica_, Fig. 348) fixes its little nest by a\r\nfootstalk to the stem of some plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348.--Polistes gallica.]\r\n\r\nWasps begin laying in spring, and go on laying all the summer. Each\r\ncell receives one single egg, and, as with bees, the workers' eggs are\r\nthe first laid. Eight days after the laying, there comes out of each\r\negg a larva without feet, and already provided with two mandibles.\r\nThese larvæ receive their food in the form of balls, which the\r\nfemales or the workers knead up with their mandibles and their legs\r\nbefore presenting to their nurslings, very nearly in the same way as\r\nbirds give their beak full of food to their little ones. At the end of\r\nthree weeks the larvæ cease to take food, and begin to shut themselves\r\nup in their cells, the interior of which they line with a coating of\r\nsilk. In this they change their form, and assume the appearance of the\r\nperfect insect, with its six legs and its wings, but motionless, and\r\ncontracted together. A sort of bag keeps all the organs swathed up\r\ntogether (Fig. 349). This pupa state lasts for eight or nine days, at\r\nthe end of which time the insect is fully developed; it casts its\r\nskin, breaks the door of its prison, and launches itself into the air.\r\nA cell is no sooner abandoned than a worker visits, cleans it, and\r\nputs it in a fit state to receive another egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349.--Pupa of the common wasp.]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the female wasp remains constantly in the nest,\r\nabsorbed with family cares. She is occupied in laying eggs and in\r\nfeeding her progeny, with the active assistance of the workers, or\r\nmules, as Réaumur and Charles de Geer call them, because they are\r\nunfruitful.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the nests you generally find the most perfectly\r\ngood understanding existing, and the most perfect order, in spite of\r\nthe warlike instincts of these insects. It is only on rare occasions\r\nthat this domestic peace is disturbed by the quarrels of male with\r\nmale or worker with worker; but these combats are not deadly. Never,\r\nmoreover, has one nest of wasps been known to declare war against\r\nanother for the purpose of robbing it. \"The government of wasps,\" says\r\nM. Victor Rendu, \"explains very well the gentleness of their public\r\nconduct. Amongst them there are no despots; no one either reigns or\r\ngoverns; each one lives at liberty in a free city, on the sole\r\ncondition of never being a burden to the state. They all act in\r\nconcert, without privileges or monopolies, under the influence of a\r\ncommon law--the great law of the public good, from which no one is\r\nexempted.\"[100]\r\n\r\n    [100] \"L'Intelligence des Bêtes.\" In 18mo. Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\nBut this model republic is fatally doomed to early destruction. At the\r\napproach of winter all the workers, as also the males, perish. Some\r\npregnant females alone hold out against the cold, and get through the\r\nwinter, to propagate and perpetuate their species. Before dying, these\r\ninsects destroy all the larvæ which are not hatched at the first\r\napproach of cold weather. In spring the females revive, and begin\r\nalone the construction of a new nest. They then lay workers' eggs,\r\nwhich are not long in furnishing them a whole regiment of devoted and\r\nactive assistants. These traits are pretty nearly the same for the\r\ndifferent species of wasps, the only difference being in the way in\r\nwhich they build their nests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350.--Exterior of a Wasp's Nest on a branch of a\r\ntree.]\r\n\r\nWe have already said that the common wasp makes its nest in the\r\nground. A gallery, of about an inch and a half in diameter, leads to\r\nthe nest, situated at a depth which varies from six inches to two\r\nfeet. \"It is,\" says Réaumur, \"a small subterranean town, which is not\r\nbuilt in the style of ours, but which has a symmetry of its own. The\r\nstreets and the dwelling-places are regularly distributed. It is even\r\nsurrounded with walls on all sides. I do not give this name to the\r\nside of the hollow in which it is situated; the walls I allude to are\r\nonly walls of paper, but strong enough, nevertheless, for the uses for\r\nwhich they are intended.\" Generally, the shape of the outside of a\r\nwasp's nest is spherical or oval, sometimes conical. Its diameter is\r\nabout from twelve to sixteen inches, its surface, which resembles a\r\nmass of bivalve shells, has one hole for entrance, and another for\r\nexit, just large enough to allow of one single wasp passing in or out\r\nat the same time (Fig. 350).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351.--Interior of a Wasp's Nest, after Réaumur.]\r\n\r\nThe wasps' nest is composed, in the interior, of fifteen or sixteen\r\nhorizontal galleries, arranged in storeys, and supported by numerous\r\npillars of separation. We give here (Fig. 351) a section and view of\r\nthe interior, drawn from memory by Réaumur.[101] The cakes forming the\r\ncombs are composed of hexagonal cells, which are always used as\r\ncradles, never as storehouses. They open below. The exterior envelope\r\nof the nest is made with leaves of a sort of greyish, very gummy\r\npaper, which is applied layer by layer. Réaumur has given a very\r\ndetailed account of the way in which these insects construct their\r\nnests.[102] They collect fibres of wood--which are their raw\r\nmaterial--make them into a sort of coarse lint, which they reduce to\r\nballs, and carry between their legs to the nest. These balls are next\r\nstuck on to the work already begun. Then the insect stretches them\r\nout, flattens them, and draws them into thin layers, as a bricklayer\r\nspreads mortar with his trowel. The wasp works with extreme quickness,\r\nalways backwards, so that it may have incessantly before its eyes the\r\nwork it has done: the movement of its mandibles is even quicker than\r\nthat of its legs.\r\n\r\n    [101] \"Mémoires,\" tome vi., planche 14, p. 167.\r\n\r\n    [102] _Ibid_, tome vi., p. 177.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of summer the nest may contain 3,000 workers, and many\r\nfemales, who live together in perfect harmony. The number of males\r\nexceeds that of the females. A female weighs, by herself, as much as\r\nthree males or six workers. With the exception of those which are\r\noccupied in building and in taking care of the eggs, all wasps go out\r\nhunting during the day. They are carnivorous, and may be seen\r\nattacking other insects, which they tear to pieces after having\r\nkilled, so as to carry the bits to their nests, where thousands of\r\nmouths are clamouring for their food. The wasp pays great attention to\r\nthe vines. It penetrates also into the interior of our houses, and\r\ninfests the butchers' shops; but this the butchers do not much mind,\r\nfor the wasp drives away the flies which would lay their eggs on the\r\nmeat and thus contribute to its corruption.\r\n\r\nAs the winter approaches, the wasps go out less and less, and very\r\nsoon cease to do so at all. The greater number then die, huddled up in\r\ntheir nest. A few females only, as we have said, get through the cold\r\nseason. They sleep with their wings and legs folded up, which gives\r\nthem the appearance of chrysalides. They can nevertheless sting in\r\nthis state, as M. Guérin-Méneville found out to his cost. The spring\r\nwakes them up, and they then found new colonies. \"It is at this\r\nseason,\" says M. Maurice Girard, in his book on the \"Metamorphoses of\r\nInsects,\" \"that, with a little trouble, it would be easy to diminish\r\nin a very perceptible degree the number of wasps, which are, later, so\r\ndestructive to the fruit, by catching in nets the females, which\r\nmight be attracted in quantities by means of the blossom of the black\r\ncurrant.\" This is a useful hint to gardeners.\r\n\r\nThe Hornets are distinguished from other wasps by their great size.\r\nThey make their nests in the trunks of old trees, perforating the\r\nsound wood to arrive at the heart, which is rotten, or hollowing for\r\nthemselves a hole, which they clear out by the gallery which leads to\r\nit. In this hole they construct first a dome suspended to the top by a\r\nfootstalk; then a series of combs composed of cells, hanging the first\r\nto this dome, the second to the first, and so on, by stalks or pillars\r\nof a paper-like substance. When fixed under roofs, these insects have\r\noften the form of an elongated pear. Fig. 352 represents one of these\r\nnests, after Réaumur. The societies of hornets contain fewer members\r\nthan those of the common wasp; at most 200 insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352.--Hanging Hornet's Nest.]\r\n\r\nThe _Polistes_ are a peculiar kind of wasp, smaller than the others,\r\nslender, with the abdomen tapering towards the base. The construction\r\nof their nests is more simple, having no envelopes, as shown in Fig.\r\n353. They attach them to the stems of broom, furze, or other shrubs,\r\nby a footstalk, or pedicle. They are like little paper bouquets,\r\ncomposed of from twenty to thirty cells, grouped in circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353.--Nest of _Polistes gallica_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354.--The Card-making Wasp (_Chartergus\r\nnidulans_).]\r\n\r\nThe Card-making Wasp of Cayenne (_Chartergus nidulans_, Fig. 354) is a\r\nconsummate artist. Its nest represents a sort of box or bag, made of a\r\nsubstance resembling cardboard, so fine and so white that the best\r\nworker in that material would be deceived by it. This nest has only\r\none single hole at its base; each of the combs it contains is likewise\r\npierced by a hole in its centre, to afford a passage to the wasps. In\r\nan architectural point of view, the card-making wasp is almost\r\nsuperior to the bee, for the latter does not _build_ its house, it\r\nonly _furnishes_ it, as Latreille remarks with truth. The Brazilian\r\nspecies of _Chartergus_, which the inhabitants call Lecheguana,[103]\r\nmanufactures a honey, the use of which is not without danger, as it\r\noccasions vertigo and sharp pains in the stomach. The naturalist,\r\nAuguste Saint-Hilaire, during his sojourn in Brazil, himself\r\nexperienced ill effects from eating it.\r\n\r\n    [103] Hence the scientific name, _Chartergus lecheguana_.--ED.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, solitary wasps, which make their cells in holes\r\nwhich they scoop out in the ground, or in the stalks of certain\r\nplants. In the adult state these live on honey; but their larvæ are\r\ncarnivorous, and the female is obliged to bring them living insects.\r\nThe commonest of these solitary wasps belong to the genus _Odynerus_.\r\nThis insect makes its nest in the stalk of a bramble or briar (Fig.\r\n358) with a mortar which it prepares. The larva (Fig. 356) lines its\r\ncell with a silky cocoon. It is the last egg laid which is hatched the\r\nfirst; then come the others, in an inverse order from that in which\r\nthey were deposited. If it had been in the other order, the insects\r\ncould not have come out of the cells without destroying on their way\r\nthe less advanced pupa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355.--A species of Odynerus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356.--Larva of the Odynerus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357.--Pupa of the Odynerus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358.--Nest of an Odynerus in the stem of a bramble.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTS.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Ants are as remarkable as the habits of the bees. In\r\ntheir marvellous republics each one has his fixed duties to perform,\r\nof which he acquits himself willingly and without constraint. In\r\nconsequence of their habits of foresight and frugality, ease reigns in\r\nthe dwellings of these little animals, which become attached to their\r\nnest by a feeling of patriotism. Woe betide him who disturbs them in\r\ntheir occupations, or destroys their house! Like bees, they form a\r\nregular republic, composed--first, of males; secondly, of females;\r\nthirdly of neuters, or workers. We shall see, further on, the labours\r\nand the part played by each one of these three orders of the republic.\r\nLet us speak first of the species.\r\n\r\nAnts are divided into a great number of species, which have been\r\ncarefully described by De Geer, Latreille, and Francis Huber, the son\r\nof the celebrated blind man who wrote the history of bees. All these\r\nspecies have, however, some general traits in common, by which they\r\nmay be easily distinguished from all other insects. Ants have a slim\r\nbody on long legs. The workers are stouter and smaller than the males;\r\nand these last are smaller than the females. The males have large and\r\nprominent eyes, whilst the eyes of the workers and females are small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359.--Red Ant. Male magnified. (_Myrmica rubra._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360.--Brazilian Umbrella Ant. (_Atla cephalotes._)]\r\n\r\nAnts are provided with antennæ, bent in the form of an elbow, with\r\nwhich they examine everything they meet, and which seem to assist them\r\nin the communication of their ideas. Two horny, very strong mandibles\r\nserve them at the same time as pincers, tweezers, scissors, pick-axe,\r\nfork, and sword. A thin short neck joins the head to the thorax, to\r\nwhich, in the case of the males and females, are attached four large\r\nveiny wings. The workers only have no wings. Of the three pairs of\r\nlegs, the hind ones are the longest. Each pair is armed with a spur,\r\nand fringed with very short hairs, which serve the purpose of brushes.\r\nThe abdomen, large, short, oval, or square, is always most voluminous\r\nin the females.\r\n\r\nThere are three genera of ants which we shall mention. The _Myrmicæ_\r\nhave two knobs to the pedicle, by which the abdomen is attached to the\r\nthorax; the _Poneræ_ only one. In these two genera, the females and\r\nthe neuters have a sting, and the larvæ do not spin a cocoon in which\r\nto change into pupa. Lastly, the _Formicæ_--ants properly so\r\ncalled--have but one knob on the pedicle of the abdomen, as in\r\n_Ponera_; their larvæ spin a silky cocoon. They have no sting, but\r\nthey pour into the wounds made by their mandibles an acid liquor, the\r\npungent smell of which is well known. This liquid is formic acid, a\r\nnatural product, which the chemist now-a-days knows how to make\r\nartificially, by the action of dilute sulphuric acid on maize and\r\nother vegetable matters. Their whole body is impregnated with this\r\nacid, and has a strong sour smell. Some people like to chew ants, on\r\naccount of their sourish taste. \"They also make,\" says Charles de\r\nGeer, \"creams for side-dishes, to which these ants give, they say, the\r\ntaste of lemon-juice.\" We know, in the south of France, people who\r\nhave eaten these _crèmes aux fourmis_! _Polyergus_ forms a sub-genus\r\nof _Formica_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361.--Sections of an Ant's Nest.]\r\n\r\nIn all these species, the workers, or neuters, have the charge of the\r\nbuilding, provisioning, and rearing of the larvæ--in fact, all the\r\ncare of the household, and the defence of the nest. Deprived of wings,\r\nthey are bound to the soil, and condemned to work. As compensation, to\r\nthem belong strength, authority, power: nothing is done but through\r\nthem. \"Born protectors of an immense family still in the cradle,\" says\r\nM. Victor Rendu, \"by their vigilance, their tenderness, and their\r\nsolicitude, without being mothers themselves, they share in the duties\r\nand joy of maternity. Alone, they decide on peace or war; alone, they\r\ntake part in combats: head, heart, and arm of the republic, they\r\nensure its prosperity, watch over its defence, found colonies, and in\r\ntheir works show themselves great and persevering artists.\"\r\n\r\nThe nests of ants (Figs. 361, 362) are known under the name of\r\nant-hills. They vary very much, both as to their form and the\r\nmaterials employed in making them--wood and earth are the principal.\r\nThat which strikes one at first sight, is the size of these dwellings,\r\nwhich form a curious contrast to the smallness of their builders. Each\r\nspecies of ant has an order of architecture peculiar to it. The Red\r\nAnt (_Formica rufa_), one of the commonest in our woods, constructs a\r\nlittle rounded hillock with all kinds of objects--fragments of wood,\r\nbits of straw, dry leaves, the remains of insects, &c. This hillock,\r\nthe base of which is protected by material of greater solidity, is\r\nnothing more than the exterior envelope of the nest, which is carried\r\nunderground to a very great depth. Avenues, cleverly contrived, lead\r\nfrom the summit to the interior. The openings vary in width; and, as\r\nnight approaches, are carefully barricaded. They are opened every\r\nmorning, except on rainy days, when the doors remain shut, and the\r\ninhabitants confined within.\r\n\r\nThe ant-hill, or _formicarium_, is at first simply a hole hollowed out\r\nin the soil, the entrance to which is masked by the building\r\nmaterials. But the miners do not cease to hollow out galleries and\r\nchambers, arranged by stories. The earth and rubbish are carried out,\r\nand serve to construct the upper edifice, which rises at the same time\r\nthat the excavation grows deeper. It is a labyrinth bored in all\r\ndirections. It contains corridors, landings, chambers, and spacious\r\nrooms, which communicate with each other by passages which are often\r\nvertical. All the corridors lead to a large central space, loftier\r\nthan the others, and supported by pillars; it is here that the greater\r\nnumber of the ants congregate. These ant-hills often rise to a height\r\nof fifteen inches above the ground, and descend to an equal depth.\r\nFig. 362 shows the interior of an ant-hill, drawn from Nature. Outside\r\nit are to be seen some ants occupied in sucking plant-lice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362.--Section of an Ant-hill.]\r\n\r\nThe group of Mason Ants contains a great number of varieties: the\r\nAshy-black Ant (_Formica nigra_, Fig. 363), the Brown, the Yellow\r\n(_Formica flava_), the Blood-red, the Russety (_Polyergus rufescens_),\r\nthe Black, the Miner (_Formica cunicularia_), the Turf Ant, &c. All\r\nthese species employ a mortar, more or less fine, in raising their\r\nhillocks, at the same time that they hollow out their underground\r\ndwellings. The Jet Ant (_Formica fuliginosa_) excavates wood,\r\nhollowing out its labyrinth in the trunk of a tree with consummate\r\nskill. The Red Ant (_Myrmica rubra_) plies, according to\r\ncircumstances, the trade of a mason or excavator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363.--Ashy-black Ant (_Formica nigra_). Male, female,\r\nand worker.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364.--Ashy Ant. Male, worker, and female.]\r\n\r\nThe masons work when they can profit by the rain or by the evening\r\ndew, to make their mortar. They only go out after sunset, or when a\r\nfine rain has wetted their roof. Then they set to work. They roll up\r\npellets of earth, bring them back in their mandibles, and stick them\r\non to those places where the building was left unfinished. From all\r\nsides the earth-workers may be seen arriving, laden with materials.\r\nAll these are bustling, hurrying, busy, but always in the greatest\r\norder, and with a perfect understanding among themselves. Every part\r\nof the building is going on at the same time. The apartments spring up\r\none above another, and the edifice visibly rises. The rain, the sun,\r\nand the wind consolidate and harden the building so cunningly\r\ncontrived by these industrious workers, who have received from God\r\nalone their marvellous science. With no other tool than their\r\nmandibles, the excavators work their way through the hardest wood.\r\nThey bore holes right through it, riddling it completely with numerous\r\nstoreys of horizontal galleries. The Yellow Ant raises its little\r\nhillocks in fields, and passes the winter in a burrow or underground\r\ndwelling-place.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the principal entrances, there exist, in some nests,\r\nmasked doors guarded by sentinels. Many species also hollow out\r\ncovered galleries, which they only unmask in extreme danger, either to\r\nopen an outlet for the besieged, or to turn the enemy who has already\r\ninvaded the place. Ant-hills are, in fact, perfect fortresses,\r\ndefended by a thousand ingenious contrivances, and guarded by\r\nsentinels always on the _qui vive_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365.--Larva of the Red Ant. (_Myrmica rubra_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366.--Pupa of the Red Ant (_Myrmica rubra_)\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nThe domestic life of the different species is nearly the same. The\r\nbirth and rearing of the little ones, and the duties of the adults, do\r\nnot differ perceptibly from each other in the various species of ants.\r\nThe females live together in harmony. They lay, without ceasing to\r\nwalk about, white eggs of cylindrical form and microscopic dimensions.\r\nThe workers pick them up, and carry them to special chambers. In a\r\nfortnight after the laying, the larva (Fig. 365) appears. Its body is\r\ntransparent. A head and wings can be made out, but no legs; the mouth\r\nis a retractile nipple, bordered by rudimentary mandibles, into which\r\nthe workers disgorge the juices they have elaborated in their\r\nstomachs; and as they lay by no provisions, they are obliged to\r\ngather each day the sugary liquids destined for the food of the larvæ.\r\n\r\nFrom their birth, a troop of nurses is charged with the care of them.\r\nThey put them out in the open air during the day. Hardly has the sun\r\nrisen, when the ants, placed just under the roof, go to tell those\r\nwhich are beneath, by touching them with their antennæ, or shaking\r\nthem with their mandibles. In a few seconds, all the outlets are\r\ncrowded with workers carrying out the larvæ in order to place them on\r\nthe top of the ant-hill, that they may be exposed to the beneficent\r\nheat of sun. When the larvæ have remained some time in the same place,\r\ntheir guardians move them away from the direct action of the solar\r\nrays, and put them in chambers a little way from the top of the hill,\r\nwhere a milder heat can still reach them. We then see the ants\r\nthemselves taking the well-earned luxury of a few minutes' rest,\r\nheaping themselves up together, right in the sun. There is no\r\nobservant inhabitant of the country who has not seen the curious\r\nspectacle which we have just mentioned--that is to say, the population\r\nof an ants' nest carrying into the sun the young nurslings, so that\r\nthey may experience the action of the solar heat. We recommend the\r\ndweller in towns who is in the country for a day to stretch himself\r\nout near an ant-hill in the warm weather, and witness this spectacle,\r\none of the most curious in Nature. The care which the working ants\r\nbestow on their young does not consist only in nourishing them and\r\nprocuring for them a proper temperature; they have also to keep them\r\nextremely clean. With their palpi they clean them, brush them, distend\r\ntheir skin, and thus prepare them for the critical trial of their\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the larvæ of ants, properly so called, spin themselves\r\na silky cocoon, of a close tissue and of a grey or yellowish colour;\r\nthose of the _Myrmicæ_ and of the _Poneræ_ do not surround themselves\r\nwith a silky cocoon before changing into pupæ. These are at first of a\r\npure white, but they very soon assume a brown colour, which increases\r\nuntil it becomes dark brown. They possess all the organs of the adult,\r\nenveloped in a membrane so thin that it seems to be iridescent. Fig.\r\n366 represents the pupa of the red ant. They are the cocoons enclosing\r\nthe pupæ, which are incorrectly called in the country ants' eggs, and\r\nare given to young pheasants and partridges. The pupæ remain\r\nmotionless till the insects emerge, which is accomplished with the\r\nassistance of the workers. These latter tear the covering from the\r\npupa, and complete its deliverance. They then watch over the\r\nnewly-born ant. For some days they feed it, help it to walk, and do\r\nnot abandon it till it can dispense with their good offices. These\r\nworkers, when provisions fail, or when the ant-hill is threatened with\r\nany great danger, take in their mandibles the eggs, the larvæ, the\r\npupæ, and sometimes those females and the males which refuse to follow\r\nthem. Thus laden, they go their way, to seek for another country they\r\nmay call their own. They never forget, in their hurried emigrations,\r\nthe infirm or sick workers, which would perish in the house now\r\nabandoned and deserted.\r\n\r\nThe males and females lately hatched do not enjoy the same liberty as\r\nthe young workers. They are confined to the ant-hill, where they are\r\nkept in sight till the day of the general departure. It is towards the\r\nend of the month of August that swarms of winged ants of both sexes\r\nare seen to issue forth. The males come out first, agitating their\r\niridescent and transparent wings. The females, less numerous, follow\r\nthem closely. All of a sudden one sees this troop raise itself at a\r\ngiven signal, and disappear in the air, where the coupling takes\r\nplace. The males perish immediately afterwards. The females\r\nimpregnated return to the paternal home, or else found new colonies\r\nwith the assistance of a few workers who are their escort. From this\r\nmoment they no longer require wings. The workers make haste to cut\r\nthem off, or, indeed, which oftenest happens, they themselves tear\r\nthem off. With their wings they lose the desire for liberty.\r\nHenceforward, they will quit their retreat no more, the cares of their\r\napproaching maternity now alone occupying them. The working ants\r\nreserve for them subterranean chambers, where they are kept in sight\r\nby the sentinels. At certain hours only are they to be met with in the\r\nupper storeys. When they wish to walk, a company of guards presses\r\nround them on all sides so as to prevent them from advancing too\r\nquickly. There are no sorts of attentions they do not heap upon them\r\nto make them forget their captivity. They caress them, brush them,\r\nlick them, they offer them food continually. On the least appearance\r\nof danger, the workers take possession, first of all, of the pregnant\r\nfemales, and drag them out by the secret outlets, so as to put in a\r\nplace of safety their precious persons, the hope of the community. The\r\nworkers' task is immense, for their labours increase in the same\r\nproportion as the population increases. But the division of work and\r\nthe good understanding which exists between the members of the\r\ncommunity, allow them to be prepared for anything that may happen, and\r\nto supply all their necessities.\r\n\r\nNothing is more amusing than to observe the shifts ants are put to in\r\ntransporting objects of great size. They stumble, they tumble head\r\nover heels, they roll down precipices; but, in spite of all accidents,\r\nreturn to their task, and always accomplish it. The tranquil\r\ninhabitants of these subterranean republics are bound together by\r\nmutual affection in a devoted fraternity, which makes them ever ready\r\nto assist each other. They all help one another as much as they can.\r\nIf an ant is tired, a comrade carries it on its back. Those which are\r\nso absorbed with their work that they have no time to think of their\r\nfood, are fed by their companions. When an ant is wounded, the first\r\none who meets it renders it assistance, and carries it home. Latreille\r\nhaving torn the antennæ from an ant, saw another approach the poor\r\nwounded one, and pour, with its tongue, a few drops of a yellow liquid\r\non the bleeding wound.\r\n\r\nHuber the younger one day took an ant's nest to populate one of those\r\nglass contrivances which he used for making his observations, and\r\nwhich consisted of a sort of glass bell placed over the nest. Our\r\nnaturalist set at liberty one part of the ants, which fixed themselves\r\nat the foot of a neighbouring chestnut tree. The rest were kept during\r\nfour months in the apparatus, and at the end of this time Huber moved\r\nthe whole into the garden, and a few ants managed to escape. Having\r\nmet their old companions, who still lived at the foot of the chestnut\r\ntree, they _recognised_ them. They were seen, in fact, all of them, to\r\ngesticulate, to caress each other mutually with their antennæ, to take\r\neach other by the mandibles, as if to embrace in token of joy, and\r\nthey then re-entered together the nest at the foot of the chestnut\r\ntree. Very soon they came in a crowd to look for the other ants under\r\nthe bell, and in a few hours our observer's apparatus was completely\r\nevacuated by its prisoners. When an ant has discovered any rich prey,\r\nfar from enjoying it alone, like a gourmand, it invites all its\r\ncompanions to the feast. Community of goods and interests exists\r\namongst all the members of this model society. It is the practical\r\nrealisation of the dream formed by certain philosophers of our day,\r\nwho were only able to conceive the idea, the possibility, the project\r\nof such a community of goods and interests, which is among ants a\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nHow do these insects manage to make themselves understood in such\r\nvarious ways, asking for help, giving advice, giving invitations? They\r\nmust have a language of their own, or else they must communicate their\r\nimpressions by the play of their antennæ.\r\n\r\nWhen an ant is hungry, and does not wish to disturb itself from its\r\nwork, it tells a foraging ant as it passes, by touching it with its\r\nantennæ; the latter approaches it immediately, and presents it, on the\r\nend of its tongue, some juice it has disgorged for this purpose. The\r\nantennæ, then, are used by the ants for the purpose of making\r\nthemselves understood by each other. Dr. Ebrard, who studied these\r\ninsects attentively, is of opinion that they use them in the same way\r\nas a blind man does his stick, to feel their way with, for their sight\r\nis not good. The age to which ants live is not well known. It is\r\nbelieved that the workers live many years.\r\n\r\nAnts eat all sorts of things. One sees them eating fresh or decaying\r\nmeat, fruits, flowers, particularly everything which is sugary. They\r\nattack living insects, and kill them and suck their blood. Like many\r\ninsects, they are very fond of sugary liquids--honey, syrups, pure\r\nsugar, &c. Dupont de Nemours relates in his Memoirs that, to guarantee\r\nhis sugar-basin against the invasion of ants, he had found no better\r\nplan than to make it \"an island,\" that is to say, to place it in the\r\nmiddle of a vessel full of water. He felt sure that he had made the\r\nfortress safe against any attack; but listen to the stratagem made use\r\nof by the besiegers. The ants climbed up the wall to the ceiling,\r\nexactly perpendicularly over the sugar-basin. From there they let\r\nthemselves fall into the interior of the place, penetrating thus by\r\nmain force, and without injuring any one, into the magazine. As the\r\nceiling was very high, the draught caused them to deviate from the\r\nstraight line, and thus a certain number fell into the fosse of the\r\ncitadel, that is to say, into the water in the vessel. Their\r\ncompanions stationed on the bank made all efforts imaginable to fish\r\nout the drowning ants, but were afraid of taking to the water of such\r\na large lake. All that they could do was to stretch out their bodies\r\nas far as possible (keeping on the bank the while), to lend a helping\r\nhand to their drowning friends. Nevertheless, the salvage did not\r\nprogress much; when the ants, which were getting very uneasy,\r\nconceived a happy thought. A few were seen to run to the ant-hill, and\r\nthen to reappear. They brought with them a squad of eight grenadiers,\r\nwho threw themselves into the water without any hesitation, and who,\r\nswimming vigorously, seized with their pincers all the drowning ants,\r\nand brought them all on to _terra firma_. Eleven, half-dead, were thus\r\nbrought to shore, that is, to the rim of the basin. They would\r\nprobably all of them have succumbed, if their companions had not\r\nhastened to lend them assistance. They rolled them in the dust, they\r\nbrushed them, they rubbed them, they stretched themselves on their\r\ndying companions to warm them; then they rolled them and rubbed them\r\nagain. Four were restored to life. A fifth half recovered, and, still\r\nmoving its legs and its antennæ a little, was taken home with all\r\nsorts of precautions. The six others were dead. They were carried into\r\nthe ant-hill by their afflicted companions. It seems like a dream to\r\nread such things as this, and yet Dupont de Nemours tells us, \"I have\r\nseen it!\" Ants are also very fond of a peculiar liquid which the\r\nplant-lice secrete from a pouch in the abdomen. When they have got\r\npossession of a plant-louse, they excite it to secrete this liquid,\r\nbut without doing it any harm. They carry the plant-lice into the\r\nant-hill, or into private stables. There they keep them, give them\r\ntheir food, and suck them. We have already mentioned these curious\r\nrelations which are established between ants and plant-lice.[104] Fig.\r\n367 shows an ant thus occupied. The _Gallinsecta_ also furnish the\r\nants with sugary liquids.\r\n\r\n    [104] See the Order Hemiptera, _supra_.--ED.\r\n\r\nDuring the cold of winter the ants sleep at the bottom of their nests,\r\nwithout taking any food. A small number of species only hold out\r\nthrough the severe season, by shutting themselves up in the ant-hill\r\nwith a number of plant-lice. It is thus that they pass the winter with\r\na supply of food. We must mention, however, that in warm countries the\r\nants do not hybernate.\r\n\r\nWe have just described ant society during the quiet periods, when\r\npeace reigns supreme; but they are not more exempt than other animals\r\nfrom the necessities and dangers of war. They have a great many\r\nenemies among the population of the woods; they must, then, be\r\nprepared to repel their attacks. They display in that the most\r\nscientific resources of the military art applied to defence.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to say that the sentinels are, at all times,\r\nposted at a reasonable distance from the ant-hill, to observe the\r\nenvirons. When the fortress is unexpectedly attacked, whether by large\r\ninsects, Coleoptera for instance, or by the ants from a neighbouring\r\nnest, these vigilant sentinels immediately fall back and give the\r\nalarm to the camp, not, however, without having boldly confronted the\r\nenemy and opposed to him an honourable resistance. Having re-entered\r\nthe nest in all haste, they precipitate themselves into the passages,\r\ntapping with their antennæ all the ants which they meet, and thus\r\nspreading the alarm in the city. Very soon the agitation has become\r\ngeneral, and thousands of combatants sally forth from the citadel,\r\nready to repel the attack and make the enemy bite the dust.\r\n\r\nThe possession of a flock of plant-lice is sometimes a subject of\r\ndiscord, and becomes a _casus belli_ between two neighbouring\r\nant-hills. But, usually, the war has for its object to make prisoners\r\nin other nests, and to carry off part of the inhabitants as slaves.\r\nThis is the origin of _mixed ant-hills_, which, independently of their\r\nnatural founders, contain one or two foreign species, helots whom the\r\nconquerors have taken away from their birth-place, to make of them\r\nauxiliaries and slaves. In these mixed ant-hills the species imported\r\noccasionally exceed in number the original population, as it happens\r\nsometimes in those ships which are used in the slave trade, and on\r\nwhich the slaves are often found in greater numbers than the sailors\r\ncomposing the crew. The phalanx of ants reduced to a state of slavery\r\npay all sorts of attentions to their masters. They lick them, brush\r\nthem, caress them, carry them on their backs, feed them--good and\r\nfaithful servants that they are--and even rear their progeny. The\r\nmasters impose on their slaves all sorts of work. They only reserve\r\nfor themselves the making of war. From time to time they undertake\r\nexpeditions against some neighbouring ants' nest. If they are\r\nconquered and come back without bringing with them any prisoners, the\r\nslaves or auxiliaries are sulky to them, and will not allow them for\r\nsome time to enter the nest. If, on the contrary, they return loaded\r\nwith booty, they flatter them, give them food, and relieve them of\r\ntheir prisoners, which they lead away into the interior of the\r\nfortress. The warlike tribes, however, never carry off any other but\r\nthe larvæ and nymphs of workers from the ant-hills they plunder. These\r\nyoung captives get used to their kidnappers: brought up in fear of\r\ntheir masters, they never think of abandoning them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367.--An Ant milking Aphides or Plant-lice\r\n(magnified).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368.--Russet Ants (_Polyergus rufescens_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369.--Blood-red Ant (_Formica sanguinea_).]\r\n\r\nTwo species constitute the warrior tribes which form societies mixed\r\nwith the species they reduce to slavery. They are the Russet Ant (Fig.\r\n368) and the Blood-red Ant (Fig. 369). They always attack the nests of\r\nthe Ashy-black (_Formica fusca_) and the Miners.\r\n\r\nThe Russet Ant has mandibles made for war; they appear cut out for\r\nstruggling and fighting. The Blood-red Ants are less ferocious; they\r\nwork themselves, and make none of those sweeping raids by which the\r\nRusset Ants depopulate the neighbouring ant-hills.\r\n\r\nWhat Peter Huber has done for bees, Francis Huber, his son, has done\r\nfor the ants. It is from Francis Huber that we borrow the description\r\nwhich it remains for us to give of the habits of ants in times of war.\r\nHe thus relates one of these expeditions, of which he was a\r\nwitness:--\"On the 17th of June, 1804,\" says he, \"as I was walking in\r\nthe environs of Geneva, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw\r\nat my feet a legion of largish russet ants crossing the road. They\r\nwere marching in a body with rapidity, their troop occupied a space of\r\nfrom eight to ten feet long by three or four inches wide; in a few\r\nminutes they had entirely evacuated the road; they penetrated through\r\na very thick hedge, and went into a meadow, whither I followed them.\r\nThey wound their way along the turf, without straying, and their\r\ncolumn remained always continuous, in spite of the obstacles which\r\nthey had to surmount. Very soon they arrived near a nest of ashy-black\r\nants, the dome of which rose among the grass, at twenty paces from the\r\nhedge. A few ants of this species were at the door of their\r\nhabitation. As soon as they descried the army which was approaching,\r\nthey threw themselves on those which were at the head of the cohort.\r\nThe alarm spread at the same instant in the interior of the nest, and\r\ntheir companions rushed out in crowds from all the subterranean\r\npassages. The russet ants, the body of whose army was only two paces\r\ndistant, hastened to arrive at the foot of the nest; the whole troop\r\nprecipitated itself forward at the same time, and knocked the\r\nashy-black ants head over heels, who, after a short but very smart\r\ncombat, retired to the extremity of the habitation. The russet ants\r\nclambered up the sides of the hillock, flocked to the summit, and\r\nintroduced themselves in great numbers into the first avenues; other\r\ngroups worked with their teeth, making a lateral aperture. In this\r\nthey succeeded, and the rest of the army penetrated through the breach\r\ninto the besieged city. They did not make a long stay there; in three\r\nor four minutes the russet ants came out again in haste, by the same\r\nadits, carrying each one in its mouth a pupa or larva belonging to\r\nthe conquered. They again took exactly the same road by which they\r\nhad come, and followed each other in a straggling manner; their line\r\nwas easily to be distinguished on the grass by the appearance which\r\nthis multitude of white cocoons and larvæ, carried by as many\r\nrusset-coloured ants, presented. They passed through the hedge a\r\nsecond time, crossed the road, and then steered their course into a\r\nfield of ripe wheat, whither, I regret to say, I was unable to follow\r\nthem.\"[105]\r\n\r\n    [105] \"Recherches sur les Moeurs des Fourmis indigènes,\" p.\r\n    210. Paris, 1810.\r\n\r\nHuber adds that, having returned to the pillaged nest to examine it\r\nmore closely, he saw some ashy-black workers bringing back to their\r\nhome the few larvæ which they had succeeded in saving. Having later\r\ndiscovered the nest of these Amazons, which is the name he gives to\r\nthe warrior ants, he found there many of the ashy-black ants living on\r\nvery good terms with their kidnappers.\r\n\r\nThe Amazons begin their expeditions at the end of June, during the\r\nhottest hours of the day. They come out in long files, eight or ten\r\nabreast, preceded by their scouts. These columns start at a run, in a\r\nstraight line, and without feeling their way. They have no chieftain.\r\nThe van is re-formed every moment. Those who are in front do not\r\nremain there; at the end of a certain time they go and range\r\nthemselves in the rear, and are replaced by those which were behind.\r\nThe whole troop is thus in constant communication through its entire\r\nlength. Rarely does the expedition divide into two bodies. Arrived\r\nunder the walls of the fortress, the column halts and masses itself\r\ninto one corps. The assault is made with incredible impetuosity. In\r\nthe twinkling of an eye the place is escaladed, taken by storm, and\r\npillaged, and the ashy-black ants are either put to flight or led away\r\ninto captivity. The same ant-hill may be invaded as many as three\r\ntimes running on the same day; but then the ashy-black ants, on their\r\nguard, have barricaded themselves in, and in that case the aggressors\r\nreturn home without pillaging them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370.--Mining Ant (_Formica cunicularia_), male,\r\nworker, and female.]\r\n\r\nThe Mining Ants (Fig. 370) are less timid than the ashy-black; and, as\r\nthey defend themselves with more energy, there are frequently deadly\r\ncombats, and the field of battle is left covered with heads, legs, and\r\nlimbs, scattered about here and there with the dead and wounded. The\r\nminers pursue the pillagers, and snatch their plunder from them. But\r\nthey are sometimes driven back vigorously, and the russet ants gain\r\ntheir lair with the plunder.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of the Red Ants (_Formica sanguinea_) differ from those of\r\nthe russet. They only sally forth in small detachments, which begin by\r\nengaging in skirmishes with the scouts thrown out round the enemy's\r\nant-hill. Couriers, despatched from time to time to the camp of the\r\nred ants, bring up reinforcements. When the troop feels itself\r\nsufficiently strong, it invades the nest of the ashy-black ants, and\r\ncarries off their offspring, which the latter have not had time to\r\nsecure. Sometimes, also, the red ants instal themselves in the nest\r\nwhose inhabitants they have ejected, and transfer their own population\r\nto it. The motive for this emigration is that the old nest has become\r\nuseless, or that it is exposed to some danger. The red ants are not\r\nthe only ants which thus desert their birth-place. Many species\r\nabandon it likewise, for analogous motives, and construct elsewhere\r\nanother dwelling, to which they transport all the population of the\r\nfirst nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371.--Philanthus triangulum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372.--Mutilla Europæa, male and female.]\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the habits of ants, we are forced to admit that\r\nintelligence and reason appear still more in their acts than in those\r\nof bees. The life of ants, as well as that of bees, as far as we are\r\nconcerned, is an unintelligible enigma. The acts of animals, in\r\ngeneral, are sometimes an abyss unfathomable to our reason. The\r\nOrientals say, \"The last word may be written on man: on the elephant,\r\nnever!\" Let us add that they should no more say that the elephant will\r\nbe an inexhaustible theme, but that the history of the ant will\r\ncontinue so always.\r\n\r\nThe best-known genera of the Fossores, or Fossorial Hymenoptera, are\r\n_Philanthus_ (Fig. 371), which feeds its larvæ on bees, having first\r\nnumbed them by its sting; _Pompilus_ and _Sphex_, which attack\r\nspiders; and _Mutilla_ (Fig. 372), whose females resemble ants, being\r\nvariegated with red and yellow, the males, being provided with wings\r\nand smaller in size, and black. The _Mutillæ_ are parasitical on\r\nsolitary bees, their larvæ devouring their larvæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373.--A species of Pimpla.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374.--A species of Ophion.]\r\n\r\nOther Hymenoptera lay their eggs under the skin of certain insects,\r\nespecially when these are in the larva or caterpillar state, thus\r\nrendering service to agriculture by destroying a great number of\r\nnoxious insects. In lieu of a sting they have an auger, intended to\r\npierce the skin of their victims. It is thus that the _Ichneumons_\r\nintroduce their eggs under the skin of caterpillars. The _Pimplas_\r\n(Fig. 373), which belongs to this group, have a very long ovipositor,\r\nwhich, with its two appendages, constitute three lancets, and enable\r\nthem to get at the larvæ in their retreats. The _Ophions_ (Fig. 374)\r\nhave a sickle-shaped abdomen. They lay their eggs on the skin of\r\ncaterpillars, which they attack with the short cutting auger with\r\nwhich they are provided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375.--Gall insect (_Cynips quercusfolii_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376.--Oak Galls, produced by _Cynips quercusfolii_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377.--Interior of a Gall.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cynips_, or Gall-insects, are small black or tawny Hymenoptera,\r\nthe females of which have an auger, rolled up spirally and hidden in a\r\nfissure of the abdomen, with which they prick the young shoots of\r\nplants. A peculiar liquid which they pour into the hole round the egg\r\nthey have laid, causes an excrescence to grow, which is called a\r\n\"gall.\" The larva is developed in the centre of this gall, and\r\ntransformed into a pupa; and afterwards into a perfect insect, which\r\nmakes its exit by a hole in the wall of its prison. Fig. 375\r\nrepresents the Cynips of the oak tree (_Cynips quercusfolii_), and\r\nFigs. 376 and 377 the galls it produces. The galls of the rose are\r\nhairy, and are sometimes called \"Robin's Cushion.\" The gall-nut, rich\r\nin tannin, which is used in the manufacture of ink, is the produce of\r\na foreign Cynips, which lives on an oak found in the East. Apples of\r\nSodom, which travellers bring back from the shores of the Dead Sea,\r\nare large galls[106] full of dry dust and larvæ.\r\n\r\n    [106] Made by _Cynips insana_.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe _Urocerata_ and the _Tenthredinetæ_ form two tribes of insects,\r\nof which the first are of great size, have a cylindrical body, the\r\nabdomen being attached to the thorax in its whole breadth, without any\r\npedicle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378.--Sirex gigas.]\r\n\r\nThe insects of the genus _Sirex_ (Fig. 378), belonging to the former\r\nof these, lay their eggs in living wood, and their larvæ live for many\r\nyears in the interior. They are to be met with in great numbers in\r\nforests of pine trees, and, according to Latreille, show themselves\r\nsometimes in such great numbers as to become an object of terror. The\r\nfemale of the Giant Sirex (_Sirex gigas_) possesses a long rectilinear\r\nauger. The mandibles of the larvæ are of great strength, and are even\r\ncapable of perforating lead. This fact has been observed many times.\r\nIn 1857 Marshal Vaillant presented to the Académie des Sciences some\r\npackets of cartridges containing balls which had been pierced through\r\nby the larvæ of the Sirex during the sojourn of the French troops in\r\nthe Crimea. Some of these insects were still shut up in the gallery\r\nwhich they had hollowed out in the metal. M. Dumeril (and this was one\r\nof the last works of that venerable and learned naturalist) wrote a\r\nReport on this subject, in which were recorded many analogous\r\ninstances. He quoted, as an example, that M. le Marquis de Brême, in\r\n1844, showed to the Société Zoologique many cartridges in which the\r\nballs had been perforated by the insects to a depth of about a\r\nquarter of an inch. These cartridges came from the arsenal of Turin.\r\nThey had been placed in barrels made of larch wood, the inside of\r\nwhich had been attacked by the insects. It was discovered that it was\r\nafter having left the wood that they had gnawed through the envelopes\r\nof the cartridges, and at last into the balls themselves. In 1833\r\nAudouin presented to the Société Entomologique de France a plate of\r\nlead, from the roof of a building, on which this naturalist supposed\r\nthat the larvæ of a _Callidium_[107] had made deep sinuosities, as\r\nthey do in wood. Before this, parts of the leaden roofs at La Rochelle\r\nhad been noticed not only gnawed, but pierced from one side to the\r\nother, by the larvæ of _Bostrichus capucinus_.[108] In 1844 M.\r\nDesmarest reported the erosion and perforation of sheets of lead by a\r\nspecies of _Bostrichus_ and by _Callidium_. In 1843 M. Du Boys\r\npresented to the Société d'Agriculture of Limoges some stereotyped\r\nplates--composed, as is well-known, of a very hard alloy, formed of\r\nantimony and lead--which had been pierced and riddled with holes by\r\ntwo specimens of a _Bostrichus_. The holes were a seventh of an inch\r\nin diameter by two inches in depth. The stereotypes were thus\r\nperforated, although they had been wrapped up in many folds of paper\r\nand cardboard. As the printing served for a work called \"Les Fastes\r\nMilitaires de la France,\" one may say that the brave soldiers received\r\nfrom an insect more wounds than their enemies had ever given them.\r\n\r\n    [107] A coleopterous insect.--ED.\r\n\r\n    [108] Also a beetle.--ED.\r\n\r\nTo prove that these insects have really the power to perforate metals\r\nas others perforate and pass through woody matter, the entomologist of\r\nLimoges made the following experiments. He placed in a leaden box, the\r\nsides of which were thin, a living specimen of the Fire-coloured\r\nLepture of Geoffroy (_Callidium sanguineum_), a Coleopteron which is\r\ncommonly found in houses in France in winter, its larvæ being\r\ndeveloped in great numbers in firewood. Above this box he fitted on\r\nanother, also containing a specimen of this insect, which he shut in\r\nwith a third box. A few days afterwards he separated the boxes. The\r\nmiddle one had been pierced through, and the two insects were found\r\ntogether, the one which was below having made a hole through which it\r\nmight introduce itself into the middle box. M. Du Boys made a chemical\r\nexperiment which enabled him to establish beyond a doubt that the\r\ninsect which had gnawed the metal had not made it serve as its food.\r\nThe dried body of one of these insects was analysed. After having\r\nimmersed it in nitric acid it was completely burnt, and there could\r\nnot be found in the ashes acted upon by the nitric acid the least\r\ntrace of lead. This experiment proves that these insects had for their\r\nobject only to escape from the galleries in which they were\r\naccidentally deposited in their larva state, and that it was not until\r\nthey had undergone their complete transformation that they endeavoured\r\nto gain their liberty. Observations of the same kind were multiplied\r\nafter the Report of M. Dumeril. The Académie des Sciences received, in\r\nthe month of June, 1861, two Memoirs--one from M. Heriot, captain of\r\nartillery, the other from M. Bouteille, curator of the Museum of\r\nNatural History of Grenoble--containing many new observations on the\r\nperforation by insects of leaden balls contained in cartridges\r\nprepared for war. M. Milne-Edwards read to the Académie des Sciences a\r\nshort Report on these works.\r\n\r\nThe insect which had produced the perforations observed in the balls\r\nsent to the Crimea in 1857, and which M. Dumeril particularly studied,\r\nwas the _Sirex juvencus_, and had been taken from France in the wood\r\nforming the boxes which contained the cartridges. In the other case of\r\nwhich we are speaking, that is to say, of the cartridges which were\r\nsent in 1861 to the Académie by Captain Heriot and by M. Bouteille,\r\nthe perforations had been produced by other species. M. Milne-Edwards,\r\nwho found the insect that had caused this strange damage, had no\r\ntrouble in recognising it as the _Sirex gigas_, which, in its larva\r\nstate, lives in the interior of old trees or pieces of wood, and\r\nwhich, after it has gone through all its metamorphoses, comes out of\r\nits retreat to reproduce its kind. To clear themselves a passage, they\r\ncut away with their mandibles the ligneous substances or other hard\r\nbodies they meet with on their road. It was in pursuing this object\r\nthat the insects, imprisoned accidentally in the packets of cartridges\r\nwhen they were yet only in the larva state, must have attacked the\r\nleaden balls, as also the paper and the other matters which they met\r\nwith on their road, and which opposed their passage. M. Bouteille\r\nproves, in his Memoir, that M. Dumeril has committed an error in\r\nsaying that the perforating organ employed by the _Sirex_ to attack\r\nthe leaden balls in the cartridges in the Crimea was the auger\r\nsituated at the extremity of the abdomen of the female, and intended\r\nfor cutting into that part of the wood where it is to lay its eggs. M.\r\nBouteille has established, in fact, that they were not only the\r\nfemales which attacked the cartridges, but that the males, which have\r\nno auger, had occasioned the same damage.\r\n\r\nThe _Tenthredinetæ_ are called \"Saw-Flies,\" because the females are\r\nfurnished with a double auger, notched like a saw, with which they cut\r\ninto the branches in which they lay their eggs. The larvæ of these\r\ninsects have a striking resemblance to the caterpillars of\r\nLepidoptera. They can only be distinguished from them by a great\r\nglobular head, not hollowed out, and by their abdominal legs, in\r\ngeneral to the number of more than ten. They are called false\r\ncaterpillars (Fig. 379). Most of them, when touched, erect themselves\r\nand move about in a threatening manner. They spin a silken cocoon\r\nbefore changing into pupæ. The _Lophyrus pini_, which devours the\r\nleaves of pine trees, belongs to this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379.--Larva of a Saw-Fly. (_Tenthredo_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380.--Lophyrus pini.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nTHYSANOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very small black flies which are such a source of annoyance to\r\ntravellers in the summer-time, and which fly into our eyes and crawl\r\nover our faces during the prevalence of warm windy weather,\r\nprincipally belong to a kind of insect which is characterised by\r\nhaving very remarkable wings when in the adult condition. These\r\ninsects exist by myriads, and there are several species of them; and\r\nthey are all exceedingly destructive to flowers, and especially to the\r\nbloom of cereal plants. The little black insects are to be seen on\r\nalmost every flower, and they devour the delicate cellular tissues of\r\nthe petals. _Thrips cerealium_ is very destructive when it occurs in\r\nmultitudes upon the wheat, barley, and oats, for it interferes with\r\nthe proper nutrition of the grain, by nibbling the protecting\r\nenvelopes and the tissue which connects it to the stalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 381, 382.--The Adult Insect and Larva of _Thrips\r\ncerealium_ (magnified).]\r\n\r\nAll the members of the genus _Thrips_--and they alone constitute the\r\norder now under consideration--possess four very narrow membranous\r\nwings, without any folds or network upon them, but furnished and\r\ndecorated with beautiful fringes upon the edges. These fringes\r\ncharacterise the Order, which in other respects is closely allied to\r\nthe Orthoptera, and they give the name to it. The Thysanoptera\r\n([Greek: thysanoi], fringes; [Greek: pteron], a wing) have filiform\r\nantennæ and very large eyes, and the different species of the genus\r\nThrips have a great diversity of wing fringing. The structure of the\r\nwings is somewhat analogous to that observed in the Lepidoptera, in\r\nthe Pterophorina and the Alucitina.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphoses of the Thysanoptera have not received much\r\nattention, but they are known to be of the incomplete kind. The quiet\r\nchrysalis condition is not observed, and the larvæ are born from the\r\negg greatly resembling the adults. The absence of wings is the great\r\ndistinction between the larval and the imago state, as it is in the\r\nclosely-allied order of the Orthoptera. The larva moults several\r\ntimes, and the wings are gradually added, the colour of the insect\r\naltering also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nNEUROPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Neuroptera--the type of which order are the _Libellulæ_, or Dragon\r\nFlies--have four membranous wings, generally rather broad, provided\r\nwith transverse delicately reticulated nervures, which gives them the\r\nappearance of lace. Although one of the least extensive, this Order\r\npresents the greatest modifications of form and of habits.\r\n\r\nOne section of Neuroptera contains some insects which undergo\r\nincomplete metamorphoses. The _Libellulæ_, the _Ephemeræ_, and the\r\n_Termites_, belong to this category. The insects belonging to the\r\nother section, in which are classed the _Phryganidæ_,[109] or Caddis\r\nFlies, the _Panorpatæ_, and the _Myrmelionides_, or Ant Lions, undergo\r\ncomplete metamorphoses. The pupæ of the first walk and live absolutely\r\nin the same way as the larvæ; only, at the moment of the last\r\ntransformation, the skin of the pupa splits, and the perfect insect\r\ncomes forth. In the case of the second, on the contrary, the pupa is\r\nmotionless, inactive, and takes no food, as in the Hymenoptera,\r\nColeoptera, &c. In spite of this diversity in their mode of\r\ndevelopment, all these insects resemble each other too much for us to\r\ndivide the Order; from which it follows that we must not attach too\r\nmuch importance to differences of transformation by which the insect\r\narrives at its perfect state.\r\n\r\n    [109] These were separated from the Neuroptera and made a\r\n    separate order, under the name of Trichoptera, by Kirby.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting insects among the Neuroptera are the _Termites_,\r\nimproperly called White Ants, on account of the great analogy which\r\nexists between their habits and those of ants. They constitute, by\r\ntheir way of living, a striking anomaly in the order in which their\r\nconformation places them. In fact, they live in very numerous societies,\r\nand build very solid and very extensive dwelling-places--quite\r\nCyclopean or Titanic works in comparison to the tiny dimensions and\r\nweak and feeble appearance of the insect. (PLATE IX.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IX. Nests of White Ants.]\r\n\r\nMany travellers have spoken of these insects. They are met with in the\r\nsavannahs of North America, in Guyana, in Africa, in New Holland, and\r\neven in Europe, whither they have been imported. M. de Prefontaine\r\nrelates that, when he was travelling in Guyana, he saw the negroes\r\nbesieging certain strange buildings, which he calls ant-hills. They\r\ndared not attack them, except from a distance, and with fire-arms,\r\nalthough they had taken the precaution of digging all round them a\r\nlittle fosse filled with water, in which the besieged would be drowned\r\nif they made a sortie. These were the termites' nests.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is to termites Herodotus alludes when he speaks of ants\r\nwhich inhabit Bactria, and which, larger than a fox, eat a pound of\r\nmeat a day.[110] Retired in the sandy deserts, these gigantic insects\r\nhollow out (says he) subterranean dwellings, and raise mounds of\r\ngolden sand, which the Indians carry away at the peril of their lives.\r\nPliny, who relates the same fables, adds that there were to be seen in\r\nthe Temple of Hercules the horns of these ants. Even in our own days\r\nsome travellers have repeated absurd fables about termites. They have\r\nattributed to them a venom which one cannot breathe without being\r\npoisoned; they have said that a single bite was enough to cause a\r\nmortal fever. The truth, as it is revealed to us by conscientious\r\nobservers, is still stranger than these fictions or errors. The\r\ntermites present curious modifications, on the nature of which\r\nnaturalists are not agreed. There are, in the first place, the perfect\r\ninsects, males and females, which are provided with wings; then there\r\nare the neuters, which are divided into _soldiers_, whose duty it is\r\nto defend the nest, and into _workers_, upon whom devolve the\r\narchitectural works and household cares. These last are smaller than\r\nthe soldiers. Latreille and some other naturalists think that these\r\nworkers are the larvæ of the termites. Smeathman thinks that the\r\nsoldiers are the pupæ. M. de Quatrefages admits that the soldiers are\r\nthe neuters, and that the workers are recruited both from the larvæ\r\nand from the pupæ. It may be admitted, with other naturalists, that\r\nthe soldiers and the workers are neuters: the first, abortive males;\r\nthe second, abortive females. Here is, indeed, what M. Lespès has\r\nobserved in the termites of the Landes. Among these insects, the most\r\nnumerous are the workers: their size is that of a large ant, and their\r\nduties are to excavate galleries, to search for provisions, and to\r\ntake care of the eggs, the larvæ, and the pupæ. The workers have a\r\nrounded head and short mandibles, and are blind. The soldiers, less\r\nnumerous, have an enormous head--nearly as big as the rest of their\r\nbody--very strong, crossed mandibles, and are blind like the workers.\r\nAnatomy showed M. Lespès that both are _neuters_--that is, the\r\nsoldiers, males, and the workers, females--with aborted organs.\r\n\r\n    [110] De Quatrefages, \"Souvenirs d'un Naturaliste,\" tome ii.,\r\n    p. 377. In 18mo. Paris, 1854.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the females much resemble the workers. Those which are to\r\nbecome males or females are distinguished from those which are to\r\nbecome neuters by very slight rudiments of wings, and their pupæ show\r\nalready imperfect wings, hidden in cases; furthermore, they have eyes\r\nhidden under the skin. The males and females alone have eyes; they\r\nalso have wings, which they lose immediately after the coupling. Those\r\nwhich proceed from the pupæ with long wing cases become small kings\r\nand queens after their swarming, which takes place at the end of May.\r\nThe pupæ with short wing-cases become perfect in the month of August,\r\nand produce larger males and females, which become kings and queens.\r\nAll these couples are collected by the neuters; and the queens, large\r\nand small, set to work immediately to lay. The largest are much the\r\nmore fruitful. The workers do not seem to take any care of them at\r\nall. With the exception of this last peculiarity, everything probably\r\ngoes on in the same manner with the exotic termites; but with the\r\nlatter the queen is an object of worship.\r\n\r\nFig. 383 represents the four types of the republic of the _Termes\r\nlucifugus_. On the left is a worker, on the right a soldier, in the\r\ncentre a winged male, all three very much magnified, the lines drawn\r\nby their side showing the natural size. Below the male is the pregnant\r\nqueen (D D D D), of a species of which we are about to speak, of the\r\nnatural size.\r\n\r\nMany species of termites were studied with care by the English\r\ntraveller, Smeathman, at the end of the last century, in Southern\r\nAfrica. His account of them is the most exact and most complete which\r\nwe have of these insects.[111] The largest of the species observed is\r\nthe _Termes bellicosus_. The workers are a fifth of an inch long, the\r\nbody soft, and of an extreme delicacy, but the sharp mandibles capable\r\nof attacking the hardest bodies. The soldiers are twice as long, and\r\nweigh as much as fifteen workers, and may be distinguished by their\r\nenormous horned head, armed with sharp pincers. The male weighs as\r\nmuch as thirty workers, and attains to a length of nearly four-fifths\r\nof an inch.\r\n\r\n    [111] \"Some Account of the Termites,\" &c., in the\r\n    _Philosophical Transactions_, vol. lxxi. 1781.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383.--Termes lucifugus. Male (A), Worker (B),\r\nSoldier (C), magnified. Fecundated female of _Termes bellicosus_,\r\nnatural size, surrounded by workers (D D D D).]\r\n\r\nBut the pregnant female leaves all these dimensions far behind. Her\r\nabdomen becomes two thousand times as big as the rest of her body!\r\nShe then attains to six inches in length, and weighs as much as thirty\r\nthousand workers. By a hideous contrast, the head alone does not\r\nincrease in size. D D D D (Fig. 383) is an exact representation of\r\nthis monster. She is always motionless and captive in her cell,\r\nentirely occupied in laying. Her fecundity surpasses all bounds: sixty\r\neggs a minute, more than 80,000 a day. Smeathman is inclined to think\r\nthat this prodigious laying goes on during the whole of the year.\r\n\"This soft, whitish beast,\" says M. Michelet, \"a belly rather than a\r\nbeing, is as large, at least, as one's thumb; a traveller professes to\r\nhave seen one of the size of a crawfish. The larger she is, the more\r\nfruitful, the more inexhaustible, this terrible insect-mother seems to\r\nbe the more adored by the fanatical rabble. She seems to be their beau\r\nideal, their poetry, their enthusiasm. If you carry away with any\r\nrubbish a portion of their city, you see them instantly set to work at\r\nthe breach to build an arch which may protect the venerated head of\r\nthe mother, to reconstruct her royal cell, which will become (if there\r\nare sufficient materials) the centre, the base of the restored city. I\r\nam not astonished, though, at the excessive love which this people\r\nshow for this instrument of fecundity. If all other species did not\r\ncombine to destroy them, this truly prodigious mother would make them\r\nmasters of the world, and--what shall I say?--its only inhabitants.\r\nThe fish alone would be left; but insects would perish. It suffices to\r\nbe remembered that the mother-bee does not produce in a year what the\r\nfemale white ant can produce in a day. By her they would be enabled to\r\ndevour everything; but they are weak and tasty, and so everything\r\ndevours them.\"[112] In fact, birds are very greedy after termites;\r\npoultry destroy immense quantities of them. Ants give chase to them\r\nand eat them by legions. The negroes in Southern Africa cannot be\r\nsated with them. They gather such as have fallen into the water, and\r\nroast them like coffee; thus prepared, they eat them by handfuls, and\r\nfind them delicious. The Indians smoke the termites' nests, and catch\r\nthose that have wings. They knead them up with flour, and make a sort\r\nof cake of them. Travellers, moreover, all agree in speaking of them\r\nas very nice food, comparing their flavour to that of marrow or of a\r\nsugared cream. Smeathman prefers them to the famous palm worm (_ver\r\npalmiste_ of the colonists), a delicacy known in South America, which\r\nis the larva of the _Calandra palmarum_, a species of beetle. It\r\nseems, however, that an abuse of fried termites brings on a dysentery\r\nwhich may prove mortal.\r\n\r\n    [112] J. Michelet, \"L'Insecte,\" p. 328.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X. Nest of the White Ant (_Termes bellicosus_), in\r\nCentral Africa, after Smeathman. 1. Male. 2, 4, 5. Neuters. 3. Gravid\r\nFemale.]\r\n\r\nAll the species of termites are miners, but the greater number are\r\nalso architects and masons. A few make their nests round a branch of a\r\ntree. This nest is of enormous dimensions: it is as large as a tun.\r\nThe illustration (PLATE X.)--after a drawing in Smeathman's\r\nwork--shows a nest of the _Termes bellicosus_, composed of bits of\r\nwood firmly stuck together with gum. Above their subterranean\r\ngalleries the greater part of termites construct vast edifices, which\r\ncontain their magazines and nurseries. The _Termes mordax_ and _Termes\r\natrox_ raise perfect columns, surmounted by capitals which project\r\nbeyond them and give them the appearance of monstrous mushrooms. These\r\ncolumns attain a height of twenty inches, with a diameter of five;\r\nthey are constructed with a black clay, which, worked up by the\r\ninsects, acquires great hardness. The interior is hollow, or rather\r\nperforated with irregular cells; but the most curious edifices are\r\nthose of _Termes bellicosus_. These are irregularly conical mounds,\r\nflanked by a certain number of turrets, decreasing in height.\r\nSmeathman gives them a height of from ten to twelve feet; but\r\nJobson[113] affirms that he has seen some as high as twenty feet. If\r\nmen constructed monuments so disproportionate to their size, the great\r\npyramid of Giseh, instead of being 146 mètres in height, would be\r\n1,600, and would be higher than the Puy-de-Dôme!\r\n\r\n    [113] \"History of Gambia.\"\r\n\r\nThese knolls of earth are of a solidity which will bear any trial. Not\r\nonly can many men mount on them without shaking them, but buffaloes\r\nestablish themselves upon them as watch-towers, from which they can\r\nsee over the high grass which covers the plain, if the lion or the\r\npanther is threatening them. These edifices are hollow; but their\r\nsides are from fifteen to twenty inches thick, and are as hard as a\r\nrock. They are hollowed out into galleries, which connect them with\r\nthe underground dwelling. Under the dome is a pretty large vacant\r\nspace, a sort of top storey or attic, occupying one-third of the total\r\nheight, and which keeps up in the edifice a more uniform temperature\r\nthan if all the block had been filled up. On a level with the ground\r\nis the royal cell, oblong, with a flat floor and a rounded ceiling,\r\nand pierced with round windows. All round are distributed the offices;\r\nthey are rooms also with rounded and vaulted ceilings, communicating\r\nwith each other by corridors. On the sides rise the magazines, with\r\ntheir backs placed against the walls of the house; they are filled\r\nwith gums and with vegetable juices solidified and in powder. On the\r\nceiling of the royal chamber rise pillars of about two feet in\r\nheight, which support the egg rooms. These are little cells with\r\npartitions of saw-dust stuck together with gum, which separate at the\r\nopening the large chambers from the clay halls. Placed between the\r\nattics and the great nave surmounting the royal hall, the nursery is\r\nin the most desirable position possible for uniformity of temperature\r\nand for ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe royal cell encloses a unique couple, objects of the most assiduous\r\nattentions, but kept in closest captivity, for the doors are too\r\nnarrow to afford a passage to the monstrous queen, and even to the\r\nmale, who keeps generally crouching by her side. Thousands of servants\r\nbusy themselves round the mother; they feed her and carry away, night\r\nand day, the myriads of eggs which she lays. The eggs are placed in\r\nthe egg houses, where they give birth to white larvæ, resembling the\r\nworkers, which nourish themselves at first on a sort of mouldy fungus\r\nwhich grows on the partitions of their cells. They then become pupæ,\r\nthen neuters, or males and females, the last two being provided with\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nOn a stormy evening the males and females come out of their nest by\r\nmillions to couple in the air; then immediately afterwards they fall\r\nto the ground and lose their wings, when they become an easy prey to\r\ntheir enemies. A few couples only, picked up by the workers, are put\r\nunder shelter, and become the nucleus of a new colony. The soldiers\r\nhave no other occupation but to defend the nest. If man attacks them,\r\nat the first blow with the pick-axe they are to be seen running out\r\nfuriously. They attack their aggressors, pierce them till they bring\r\nblood, and with their sharp pincers hang on to the wound, and allow\r\nthemselves to be torn to pieces rather than leave go their hold. The\r\nnegroes who have no clothes are soon put to flight; Europeans only get\r\noff with their trousers very much spotted with blood. During the\r\ncombat, the soldiers strike from time to time on the ground with their\r\npincers, and produce a little dry sound, to which the workers answer\r\nby a sort of whistling. The workers immediately make their appearance;\r\nand with their pellets of mortar set to work to stop up the holes, and\r\nto repair the damage. The soldiers then re-enter, with the exception\r\nof a small number, who remain to superintend the work of the masons;\r\nthey give, at intervals, the usual signal, and the workers answer by a\r\nwhistling which means, \"Here we are!\" as they redouble their activity.\r\nIf the attack recommences, the soldiers are at their posts, defending\r\nthe ground inch by inch. During this time the workers mask the\r\npassages, stop up the galleries, and wall up with care the royal cell.\r\nIf you manage to penetrate as far as this sanctuary, you may pick up\r\nand carry away from the cell which contains them the precious couple\r\nwithout the workers in attendance on them interrupting their work, for\r\nthey are blind.\r\n\r\nThey never venture in sight except in extreme cases. No one is\r\nignorant of the terrible destruction these insects occasion to the\r\nworks of man. Invisible to those whom they threaten, they push on\r\ntheir galleries to the very walls of their houses. They perforate the\r\nfloors, the beams, the wood-work, the furniture, respecting always the\r\nsurface of the objects attacked in such a manner that it is impossible\r\nto be aware of their hidden ravages. They even take care to prevent\r\nthe buildings they eat away from falling by filling up with mortar the\r\nparts they have hollowed out. But these precautions are only employed\r\nif the place seems suitable, and if they intend to prolong their\r\nsojourn there. In the other case they destroy the wood with\r\ninconceivable rapidity. They have been known, in one single night, to\r\npierce the whole of a table leg from top to bottom, and then the table\r\nitself; and then, still continuing to pierce their way, to descend\r\nthrough the opposite leg, after having devoured the contents of a\r\ntrunk placed upon the table. On account of the devastations which they\r\noccasion, Linnæus has called the white ant the greatest plague of the\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nThere exist in France two species of termites, the _Termes lucifugus_,\r\na little insect of a brilliant black (at least in the male), with\r\nrussety legs, which is common enough in the moors of Gascony; and the\r\nYellow-necked White Ant (_Termes flavicollis_), which lives in the\r\ninterior of trees and does a great deal of mischief in Spain and in\r\nthe south of France to olive and other precious trees, whilst the\r\nfirst attacks oak and fir trees. Latreille established that it is the\r\n_Termes lucifugus_ which causes such havoc at La Rochelle, at\r\nRochefort, at Saintes, at Tournay-Charente, in the Isle of Aix, &c.,\r\nwhere many houses have been completely undermined by these terrible\r\ninsects. But M. de Quatrefages[114] has proved that the habits of the\r\ntermes found in towns differ in many essential points from the habits\r\nof termes in the country. And so it is most probable that the former\r\nbelong to an exotic species, which must have been unfortunately\r\nimported into France by a merchant vessel. According to M.\r\nBobe-Moreau,[115] it was only in 1797 that termites were discovered\r\nfor the first time in Rochefort, in a house which had stood for a long\r\nwhile uninhabited, and which they had completely undermined. In 1804,\r\nLatreille relates, as a \"hearsay,\" that the termites had for some\r\nyears made the inhabitants of Rochefort uneasy; but in 1829 the same\r\nauthor tells a very different tale. He speaks with dismay of the\r\nravages committed by this insect in the workshops belonging to the\r\nRoyal Navy. The importation of the termes into France is then of\r\nrecent date. A note which was sent to M. de Quatrefages by M.\r\nBeltrémieux, fixes with still greater accuracy the date of the\r\nimportation of the termites; it must have taken place about 1780, a\r\nperiod at which the brothers Poupet, rich shipowners, caused bales of\r\ngoods to come from St. Domingo to Rochefort, to La Rochelle, and to\r\nother places in that neighbourhood which possess storehouses. The\r\nravages which the termites have committed in the towns of La Saintonge\r\nare really frightful. Like Valencia, in New Granada, these towns will\r\nfind themselves one of these days suspended over catacombs. At\r\nTournay-Charente, the floor of a dining-room fell in, and the\r\nAmphytrion and his guests tumbled together in the cellar. There may be\r\nseen in the galleries of the Museum of Natural History of Paris the\r\nwooden columns which supported this room, and which were preserved by\r\nAudouin, who had been sent on a mission to report on the damages done.\r\nAudouin also selected, as an object of curiosity, a lady's bridal\r\nveil, which had been entirely riddled with holes by the termites.\r\n\r\n    [114] \"Note sur les Termites de la Rochelle.\" _Annales des\r\n    Sciences Naturelles_, 3e série, tome xx., p. 18. 1853.\r\n\r\n    [115] \"Mémoire sur les Termites observés à Rochefort.\" Saintes,\r\n    1843.\r\n\r\nAt La Rochelle these insects took possession of the Prefect's house\r\n(built by the brothers Poupet), and of the Arsenal. There they invaded\r\noffices, apartments, court, and garden. They could not drive in a\r\nstake, or leave a plank in the garden, but it was attacked the next\r\nday. One fine morning the archives of the department were found\r\ndestroyed, without there being the smallest trace of the damage to be\r\nseen on the exterior. The termites had mined through the wood-work,\r\npierced the cardboard, eaten up the parchments and the papers of the\r\nadministration, but had always scrupulously respected the upper leaf\r\nand edges of all the leaves. It was by mere chance that a clerk, less\r\nsuperficial than his colleagues, one fine day raised one of the leaves\r\nwhich hid this _detritus_, and thus discovered the destruction of the\r\narchives. All the papers of the Prefecture are now shut up in boxes of\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\nThese termites do not venture, any more than their congeners, into the\r\nlight of day. These terrible miners always envelop themselves in\r\nobscurity, and construct on all sides covered galleries as they\r\nadvance into a building. M. Blanchard and M. de Quatrefages saw in La\r\nRochelle the galleries made by them. They are tubes formed of\r\nagglutinated material, which are stuck along the walls in the cellars\r\nand the apartments, or else suspended to the roof like stalactites.\r\nCertain parts of Agen and of Bordeaux begin also to suffer from the\r\nravages of these insects. The danger appears to be imminent.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to M. de Quatrefages for some interesting experiments\r\non the termites of La Rochelle. Not only has the learned naturalist\r\nhelped to make known to us the habits of these dark-loving insects,\r\nbut he has also told us how to destroy them. Different substances have\r\nbeen tried in vain to stop these terrible ravages--essence of\r\nturpentine, arsenical soap, boiling lye, &c. M. de Quatrefages had\r\nrecourse to gaseous injections. He tried successively binoxide of\r\nnitrogen, nitric acid, chlorine and sulphurous acid; chlorine, above\r\nall, fully answered his hopes. With pure chlorine he killed the\r\ntermites instantaneously; mixed with nine-tenths of air, he suffocated\r\nthem in half an hour. \"For attacking the termites,\" says M. de\r\nQuatrefages, \"one ought to choose by preference the period of their\r\nreproduction, so as to destroy the pregnant females. It is probable\r\nthat, like their exotic congeners, the termites of France will\r\nendeavour to defend themselves by walling up the interior of their\r\ngalleries at the first signs of an attack. The operator must then act\r\nwith a great deal of promptitude, and direct the apparatus as much as\r\npossible into the very centre of their habitation, where the galleries\r\nare the broadest and the most numerous.\r\n\r\n\"With whatever care one acts, and whatever may be the success of a\r\nfirst attempt, it seems to me impossible to destroy in one campaign\r\nall the termites of a locality. In this, as in all operations of the\r\nsame kind, a certain amount of perseverance is necessary, especially\r\nif it is in a town or in a country infested by them to a very great\r\ndegree; in that case one will be forced to repeat the operation from\r\ntime to time. When, on the contrary, the termites are already\r\ncantoned, it seems to me that the success ought to be lasting. This is\r\nfortunately the case at La Rochelle; and by knowing how to profit by\r\nit, one may doubtlessly prevent the spread of these pests, which at\r\none time or another, may attack the whole town.\"[116]\r\n\r\n    [116] \"Mémoires sur la destruction des Termites.\" _Annales des\r\n    Sciences Naturelles_, 3e série, tome xx., p. 15.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the Lords of the English Admiralty addressed an inquiry to the\r\nEntomological Society of London, on the best means of preserving wood\r\nfrom the attacks of the Indian termites. In answer to this inquiry,\r\nthe Entomological Society recommended many processes: the injection\r\nof quicklime or of creosote, the application of arsenical soap, &c.\r\nBut it does not appear that these processes are infallibly\r\nefficacious, nor, above all, easy to employ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384.--Larva of Perla bicaudata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385.--Larva of a Nemoura.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386.--Perla marginata (larva).]\r\n\r\nAmong other Neuroptera which undergo incomplete metamorphoses, we may\r\nmention, first, the genera _Perla_ and _Nemoura_,[117] (Figs. 384,\r\n385, and 386), which flutter about the banks of rivers, and settle on\r\nstones, shrubs, and aquatic plants. Their larvæ are naked, without\r\ncases, and always live in the water, hiding themselves under stones,\r\nto watch for small insects, for they are carnivorous. One sees them\r\noften balancing their bodies, holding on to a pebble. They go through\r\nthe winter, and only become pupæ in the spring. After moulting, they\r\nhave the rudiments of wings. Very soon afterwards the pupæ leave the\r\nwater, and undergo their metamorphosis. The adult lives only a few\r\ndays, for its mouth is not suited for receiving food. The larvæ have,\r\nat the end of their bodies, two long threads, which remain in the\r\nperfect _Perla_, but not in the perfect _Nemoura_; the latter lose the\r\ntwo caudal hairs when they arrive at the adult state. One species of\r\n_Perla_ is very common on the quays of Paris.\r\n\r\n    [117] From [Greek: nêma], a thread; and [Greek: oura], a\r\n    tail.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387.--Perla bicaudata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388.--Nemoura variegata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389.--Nemoura variegata (larva).]\r\n\r\nThe _Ephemeridæ_, or May-Fly family, have long, slender bodies,\r\nprovided with two or three long silky hairs. Their name indicates the\r\nshort duration of their existence. They appear in great numbers at\r\ncertain seasons of the year. Their hatching takes place at sunset;\r\nthey have coupled and laid their eggs by sunrise next day, and have\r\nceased to live; so that the banks of rivers, of ponds, of lakes, are\r\nstrewed with their bodies. Their number is sometimes so considerable\r\nthat, according to Réaumur, the soil seems as if it were covered with\r\nsnow, and they are gathered up for manure. The common Ephemera, or\r\nMay-Fly (_Ephemera vulgata_, Fig. 390), is of a brown colour, banded\r\nwith yellow, and the wings smoky, with brown spots. These insects are\r\nremarkable for their elegant flight; they are continually rising and\r\nfalling. When they move their wings they rise; but if their wings,\r\nthough spread out, remain motionless, as also the silky hairs which\r\nform their tail, they fall again. They may be seen in myriads in\r\nplaces where there is much water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390.--Ephemera vulgata, imago.]\r\n\r\nWe have said that the _Ephemeræ_ live only for a few hours. This is\r\nthe general rule; but their existence can be prolonged for ten or\r\nfifteen days by preventing their copulation. If, however, the duration\r\nof the life of these insects is so short when they have reached the\r\nperfect state, and when the conformation of the mouth prevents them\r\nfrom taking any nourishment, their larvæ state is of very long\r\ncontinuance. Swammerdam says, in his curious Memoir, entitled \"Vita\r\nEphemeri,\" it is not less than three years.\r\n\r\nThe females lay their eggs in one single mass, and let them fall into\r\nthe water, in the form of a packet. The larvæ which come out of them\r\nare very active, and swim with great ease; but generally conceal\r\nthemselves under the pebbles at the bottom. The sides of their abdomen\r\nare provided with gills, very much fringed, which serve them, not only\r\nfor breathing the air under the water in the same way that fish do,\r\nbut also for swimming. The larvæ have, at the extremity of their body,\r\ntwo or three hairs, like the perfect insect. They hollow out galleries\r\nin the beds of rivers and ponds, and live on small insects. The pupa\r\n(Fig. 392) differs only from the larva (Fig. 391) in having the\r\nrudiments of wings. When about to undergo their metamorphosis, they\r\ncome out of the water and cling to plants, &c. The skin cracks on the\r\nback when it is dry, and there comes out a heavy insect, which flies\r\nfeebly, and has opaque wings. It is still enveloped in a very thin\r\nskin, of which a last moult, after a few hours, frees it. This skin\r\nremains sticking to the plant on which the moulting was effected,\r\npreserving the shape of the insect. This moult is peculiar to the\r\n_Ephemeræ_; it is the transition from the false imago (pseudo-imago)\r\nto the imago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391.--Larva of an Ephemera.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392.--Pupa of an Ephemera]\r\n\r\nIn the same family is the genus _Cloëon_, whose larvæ prey on minute\r\ninsects. The _Cloëon diptera_ (Fig. 393), which has only two wings, is\r\noften to be met with in houses, resting on the window panes and\r\ncurtains. All these insects keep badly in collections; they lose their\r\nshape, and their members are so fragile that the least shock suffices\r\nto break them.\r\n\r\nThe _Libellulas_, or Dragon-Flies, are insects of a well-defined type.\r\nThe elegance of their shape, the grace of their movements, have won for\r\nthem among the French their common appellation of \"Demoiselles.\" They\r\nare always of largish size. Many are of bright and metallic colours,\r\nwhich are not inferior in beauty to those of butterflies. Their wings,\r\nof an extreme delicacy, always glossy and brilliant, present varied\r\ntints; sometimes they are completely transparent, and have all the\r\ncolours of the rainbow. Often, the colour of the males differs from that\r\nof the females. They may be seen fluttering about on the water during\r\nthe whole summer, especially when the sun is at its highest. They fly\r\nwith extreme rapidity, skimming over the water at intervals, and\r\nescaping easily when one wishes to catch them. Nothing is prettier than\r\na troop of dragon-flies taking their sport on the side of a pond or on\r\nthe banks of a river, on a fine summer's day, when a burning sun causes\r\ntheir wings to shine with most vivid colours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393.--Cloëon diptera.]\r\n\r\nIn the perfect state, as well as in that of the larva and the pupa,\r\nthe _Libellulæ_ are carnivorous. Their rapid flight makes them expert\r\nhunters, and their enormous eyes embrace the whole horizon. They\r\nseize, while on the wing, flies and butterflies, and tear them to\r\npieces immediately with their strong mandibles. Sometimes, the ardour\r\nof the chase leading them on far from the streams, they are met with\r\nin the fields. The female lays her eggs in the water, from which\r\nemerge larvæ which remind one somewhat of the form of the insect, only\r\ntheir body is more compact and their head flattened. The larvæ and\r\npupæ inhabit the bottom of ponds and streams, where, keeping out of\r\nsight in the mud, they seek for insects, molluscs, small fish, &c. If\r\nany prey passes within their reach, they dart forward, like a spring,\r\na very singular arm, which represents the under lip. It is a sort of\r\nanimated mask, armed with strong jagged pincers and supported by\r\nstrong joints, the which, taken together, is equal to the length of\r\nthe body itself. This mask acts at the same time as a lip and an arm;\r\nit seizes the prey on its passage, and conveys it to the mouth. \"When\r\nany aquatic insect approaches them at a time when they are in a humour\r\nfor eating,\" says Charles de Geer, \"they shoot the mask forward very\r\nsuddenly and like a flash of lightning, and seize the insect between\r\ntheir two pincers; then, drawing back the mask, they bring the prey up\r\nto their mandibles, and begin to eat it. I have remarked that they do\r\nnot spare those of their own kind, but that they eat each other up\r\nwhen they can, and I have also seen them devouring very small fish\r\nwhich I put by them. It is very difficult for other insects to avoid\r\ntheir blows, because, walking along generally in the water very\r\ngently, and, as it were, with measured steps--almost in the same way a\r\ncat does on the look-out for birds--they suddenly dart forward their\r\nmask and seize their prey instantaneously.\"[118] Fig. 394 represents,\r\nto the left, the larva of the dragon-fly, with the instrument of\r\nattack which we have called a \"mask,\" and which it is making use of\r\nfor seizing a small insect; on the right, the adult dragon-fly coming\r\nout of the nymph.\r\n\r\n    [118] Charles de Geer, \"Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des\r\n    Insectes,\" tome ii., 2e partie, p. 674.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394.--Larva of the _Libellula_, and the perfect\r\ninsect emerging.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395.--Libellula depressa, the Common Dragon-Fly.]\r\n\r\nThe respiration of these larvæ is very singular. Their abdomen is\r\nterminated by appendages, which they open to allow the water to\r\npenetrate into the digestive tube, the sides of which are furnished\r\nwith gills communicating with the tracheæ. The water, deprived of\r\noxygen, is then thrown out, and the larva advances thus in the water\r\nby the recoil. It has no tufts of external lateral gills, which in the\r\ncase of the _Ephemeræ_ do the duty of fins. The pupa already presents\r\nstumps of wings. To effect its metamorphosis it drags itself out of\r\nthe water, where it has lived for nearly a year, climbs slowly to some\r\nneighbouring plant, and hangs itself there. Very soon the sun dries\r\nand hardens its skin, which all of a sudden becomes crisp, and cracks.\r\nThe dragon-fly then sets free its head and its thorax, and its legs;\r\nits wings, still soft and wanting in vigour, gain strength by coming\r\nin contact with the air, and, after a few hours, they have attained\r\ntheir full development. Immediately the insect abandons, like a\r\nworn-out suit, the dull slimy skin which had covered it so long, and\r\nwhich still preserves its shape (Fig. 394), and dashes off in quest of\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nThe _Libellulas_ are common all over the world. Their type is the\r\n_Libellula depressa_ (Fig. 395), very common in Europe. The male is\r\nbrown, with the abdomen blue underneath; the female, of a sort of\r\nolive-yellow, bordered by yellow on the sides. Both have the abdomen\r\nbroad and flattened.\r\n\r\nThe _Æshna_, with a cylindrical abdomen, attains to the length of two\r\nand a half inches. Its flight is more rapid than that of the swallow.\r\nThe _Calepteryx_ flies more slowly. The male is of a metallic blue,\r\nits diaphanous wings are traversed by a band of greenish blue; the\r\nfemale, of a bronzed green, has wings of a metallic green, with a\r\nyellowish mark on the edge. These insects rest on reeds, retaining\r\ntheir wings in a vertical position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.--Male Raphidia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397.--Larva of a Raphidia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398.--Pupa of a Raphidia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399.--Mantispa pagana.]\r\n\r\nThe _Agrions_, which are of the same family, have the body white,\r\nbrown, or green, and the eyes very prominent. They are more slim and\r\ngraceful than the _Libellulas_, properly so called; their larva are\r\nvery elongated.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, one meets in the woods with insects having large heads\r\nand elongated thoraces. The females have a long auger, with which to\r\ndeposit their eggs under the bark of trees, where their larvæ, which\r\nfeed on insects, and twist themselves about like small serpents, live.\r\nThe pupæ are also very active; they resemble the adults very much, and\r\nhave the wings laid against the body. These insects, which are met\r\nwith everywhere, but always in small numbers, are the _Raphidias_,\r\nwhich we see represented (Figs. 396, 397, 398) in the state of larva,\r\npupa, and adult, and the _Mantispas_ (Fig. 399), one species of which\r\nis common in the south of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 400.--Semblis lutarius, imago, pupa, and larva.]\r\n\r\nM. Blanchard classes in the same tribe the genus _Semblis_, whose\r\nlarvæ are aquatic, with scaly heads, provided with eyes, and with\r\ncurved mandibles and short antennæ. The larvæ and the pupæ breathe,\r\nlike those of the _Ephemeræ_, by articulated external processes, or\r\ngills, analogous to those of fishes. Nevertheless the pupæ live on\r\nland, not in water. They hide themselves in the earth at the foot of\r\ntrees, and the adult issues forth at the end of a fortnight, leaving\r\nits pupa skin behind. It lives but a few days. The female lays her\r\neggs on reeds, stones, &c. Fig. 400 represents the Mud _Semblis_ in\r\nits three states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 401.--Ant-lion (_Myrmeleo formicarius_).]\r\n\r\nWe now come to those Neuroptera which undergo complete metamorphoses.\r\nThey are the Myrmeleonidæ, of which the Ant-lion (_Myrmeleo_) is the\r\nmost prominent type, and the _Phryganidæ_, or Caddis Flies.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the Ant-lions live on the land, and are carnivorous. When\r\nabout to undergo their transformation into pupæ, they spin for\r\nthemselves a silky cocoon. The larvæ of the _Phryganeas_, on the\r\ncontrary, live in the water. They surround themselves with a sort of\r\nprotecting case, composed of a silky shell and incrustations of all\r\nsorts. The pupæ, as well as the larvæ of these insects, breathe by\r\nmeans of gills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 402.--Ant-lion's funnel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403.--Larva, cocoon, and pupa of the Ant-lion.]\r\n\r\nThe Ant-lion (_Myrmeleo formicarius_, Fig. 401) is found in the\r\nenvirons of Paris. It is an elegant insect, resembling the dragon-fly,\r\nbut is distinguished from it by its antennæ. Its larva is of a rosy,\r\nrather dirty grey, with little tufts of blackish hair on its very\r\nvoluminous abdomen. Its legs are rather long and slender; the two\r\nanterior pair of legs are directed forwards, whilst the hind legs are\r\nfixed against the body, and only permit the animal to walk backwards.\r\nThese larvæ are met with in great abundance in sandy places very much\r\nexposed to the heat of the sun. There they construct for themselves a\r\nsort of funnel in the sand (Fig. 402), by describing, backwards, the\r\nturns of a spiral whose diameter gradually diminishes. Their strong\r\nsquare head serves them as a spade with which to throw the sand far\r\naway: they then hide themselves at the bottom of the hole, their head\r\nalone being out, and wait with patience for some insect to come near.\r\nScarcely has the ant-lion perceived its victim on the borders of its\r\nfunnel, when it throws at it a shower of dust to alarm it, and make it\r\nfall to the bottom of the precipice, which does not fail to happen.\r\nThen it seizes it with its sharp mandibles, and sucks its blood;\r\nafter which it throws its empty skin out of the hole and resumes the\r\nlook-out. Ants especially become its prey, whence its name of\r\nAnt-lion. Towards the month of July, the larvæ make themselves a\r\nspherical cocoon, mixed with grains of sand, in which they are\r\ntransformed into pupæ which are hatched towards the end of August. The\r\nperfect ant-lions diffuse an odour of roses; their flight, which is\r\nweak, distinguishes them from the dragon-flies. We meet in the south\r\nof France with a very beautiful species of Ant-lion, the _Myrmeleo\r\nlibelluloides_ (Fig. 404); its larva can move forwards, and does not\r\ndig itself a funnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 404.--Myrmeleo libelluloides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 405.--Larva of Myrmeleo libelluloides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 406.--Larva of Ascalaphus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 407.--Ascalaphus meridionalis.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Ascalaphus_ (Fig. 407) is remarkable for the long clubbed\r\nantennæ of its members, and for their rapid flight. They like the sun,\r\nand live especially in hot countries; however, one meets with the\r\n_Ascalaphus_, in the month of July, near Paris, on the dry declivities\r\nof Lardy and of Poquency. Their larvæ (Fig. 406) have mandibles\r\nadapted for suction. They watch for insects under heaps of stones, and\r\nspring upon their prey.\r\n\r\nThe first states of the _Nemoptera_[119] (Fig. 408) are as yet little\r\nknown. They are insects with wings spotted with yellow and black, the\r\nlower ones almost linear, and are met with in southern countries, and\r\nbut very rarely in the south of France.\r\n\r\n    [119] From [Greek: nêma], a thread, and [Greek: pteron], a wing.\r\n\r\nThe _Hemerobii_, to which are given by the French the name of\r\n_Demoiselles terrestres_, or Land Dragon-Flies, are very small\r\ndelicate insects, of an apple-green colour, with golden red eyes.\r\nThese insects leave on the fingers, when seized, an offensive odour.\r\nRéaumur calls them _Lions des pucerons_ (Plant-Lice Lions), because\r\ntheir larvæ, which resembles the larvæ of the ant-lions, and which\r\nlive on plants, feed on plant-lice. They attack also caterpillars.\r\nTheir mandibles are provided with a canal for suction, like those of\r\nthe foregoing species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408.--Nemoptera Coa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 409.--Osmylus maculatus.]\r\n\r\nThe insects of the genus _Osmylus_ (Fig. 409) are rather rare; but may\r\nbe found in the shrubs which border ponds. They also belong to the\r\n_Hemerobidæ_. Their larvæ live in wet ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 410.--Panorpa, male and female.]\r\n\r\nThe _Panorpatæ_ constitute a singular little family, having a peculiar\r\nshaped head, which is prolonged to a sort of long and slender beak.\r\nAristotle called them Scorpion Flies, and thought they were winged\r\nscorpions. The _Panorpas_, properly so called (Fig. 410), are found on\r\nhedges and plants during the summer. They have slim bodies spotted\r\nwith yellow and black, and four straight wings, also spotted with\r\nblack. In the males the abdomen terminates in a pair of pincers (Fig.\r\n411), which rather remind one of the tail of a scorpion, and which are\r\ndestined to seize their prey, which they kill by piercing with their\r\nbeak. The female lays her eggs in the ground (Fig. 412). In a week the\r\nlarva makes its appearance; it is a month in developing, it then\r\nburies itself still deeper in the earth, and changes into a pupa,\r\nwhich, after a fortnight, comes again into the light in the form of a\r\nperfect insect. There are two other genera of _Panorpatæ_, of which\r\n_Bittacus tipularis_ (Fig. 413), resembling a large gnat, furnished\r\nwith four wings, and _Boreus hyemalis_ (Fig. 414), of a brilliant\r\nblack, met with in Sweden and in the elevated parts of the Alps,\r\njumping about on the snow in considerable troops--are representatives.\r\nThe latter has been found in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411.--Pincer of male Panorpa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412.--Female Panorpa laying.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413.--Bittacus tipularis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 414.--Boreus hyemalis (magnified and natural size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415.--Larva of Phryganea rhombica.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416.--Phryganea rhombica, in repose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 417.--Phryganea rhombica.]\r\n\r\nThe _Phryganidæ_, or Caddis Flies, are known by their larvæ, of which\r\nanglers make great use. Réaumur classed them as aquatic moths. The\r\nsoft and delicate body of the larvæ is protected by a case, to which\r\nthey cling by two hooks, placed at the extremity of their abdomen.\r\nThey are called by different names in allusion to their habits; as,\r\nfor instance, case worms, from their living in a case covered with\r\nlittle bits of wood or sand, which they draw after them as they go.\r\nTheir scientific name, _Phryganea_, signifies _fagot_.[120] The\r\n_Phryganeæ_, in the adult state, very much resemble moths. They\r\napproach them in having rudimentary mouths, and wings without\r\narticulations, but furnished with small hairs, analogous to the scales\r\nof Lepidoptera. They may be said to form a sort of connection between\r\nthe Lepidoptera and Neuroptera. They have been called _Mouches\r\npapilionacées_, or Papilionaceous Flies. The eggs laid by the female\r\n_Phryganea_ are enclosed in gelatinous capsules, which swell in the\r\nwater and attach themselves to stones, &c. The larva has the\r\nappearance of a little worm without feet. It is soon hatched, and\r\nresembles at first a little black line, and may be easily reared in an\r\naquarium. The operation of making the silky case which it draws after\r\nit, and which protects its abdomen, may then be observed. When it is\r\ndisturbed, it retreats entirely within its case. The interior is\r\nsmooth, and lined with mud; on the exterior it is fortified with\r\nstones, &c.\r\n\r\n    [120] From [Greek: phryganion], a stick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 418. Regular cases of a Phryganea.]\r\n\r\nThe _Phryganea rhombica_ (Figs. 415, 416, 417) furnishes its case with\r\nbits of wood or grass, arranged as shown in Fig. 418. Some species\r\narrange these bits of wood and glass in spiral, others in parallel\r\nseries. The _Phryganea flavicornis_ covers its dwelling with little\r\nshells. \"These kinds of dress,\" says Réaumur, \"are very pretty, but\r\nthey are also excessively singular. A savage who, instead of being\r\ncovered with furs, should be covered with musk rats, moles, or other\r\nentire animals, would have on an extraordinary costume; this is in\r\nsome sort the case with our larvæ.\" Other _Phryganeæ_ employ for\r\nconstructing the case which serves them as a dwelling sand and small\r\npebbles; each species always employing the same materials, unless they\r\nare entirely deprived of these and obliged to employ others. These\r\ncases protect the larvæ against the voracity of their enemies. The\r\nlarvæ have a scaly head; and the three first rings of their body are\r\nharder than the rest. They live in water, and breathe by means of\r\nbranchious sacs, arranged on the abdomen in soft and flexible tufts.\r\nThey eat everything that is presented to them: leaves, and even\r\ninsects and the larvæ of their own kind. The pupæ are motionless. They\r\nstay about a fortnight in their case, the orifice of which is closed\r\nby gratings of silk, then break through the gratings, and leave their\r\nprison. In this state (Fig. 419) they swim on the water until they\r\nmeet with an object to which they can attach themselves, and so get\r\nout. Then they swell till they crack their skin over the back, and the\r\nperfect insect emerges.\r\n\r\nThe _Phryganea pilosa_ (Fig. 420) is of a yellowish grey, with hairy\r\nwings, little adapted for flying. These insects do not eat, and never\r\nleave the neighbourhood of the water. During the day they rest on\r\nflowers, on walls, or on the trunks of trees, their wings folded back,\r\nand their antennæ together. In the evening they fly in dense swarms\r\nover streams and ponds. They are attracted by light, as are many\r\nnocturnal insects; and are sometimes found in great numbers on the\r\nlamps on the quays in Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419.--Pupa of Phryganea pilosa, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420.--Phryganea pilosa.]\r\n\r\nThe _Hydropsyches_ (Fig. 421) and _Rhyacophili_ (Fig. 422) are small\r\ninsects which resemble the _Phryganeæ_ very closely. Their larvæ have,\r\nfor the purposes of respiration, some gills, others retractile tubes.\r\nThey construct for themselves fixed places of shelter, more or less\r\nimperfect, at the bottom of the water, and against large stones,\r\nwhich they leave occasionally for a few moments. Sometimes these\r\ncases contain several larvæ. Fig. 421 represents the various states of\r\na _Hydropsyche_; the larva is seen on the left, the pupa on the right,\r\nthe winged insect in the middle. Two of the insect's tents, or places\r\nof shelter, are represented below. Fig. 422 shows the different states\r\nof _Rhyacophilus vulgatus_, larva, cocoon, pupa, and imago. The genus\r\n_Rhyacophilus_ has this peculiarity, that the larva spins itself a\r\ncocoon in the interior of its dwelling before changing into a pupa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 421.--Hydropsyche (Phryganea) atomaria, larva,\r\npupa, imago, and larva-case.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422.--Rhyacophilus vulgatus, larva, pupa, cocoon,\r\nand imago (male).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nCOLEOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn collections of insects the Coleoptera almost always occupy the\r\nprincipal place. They are sought after by collectors on account of\r\nthe brightness of their colours, of the solidity of their integuments,\r\nand the facility with which they can be preserved. This circumstance\r\nhas contributed much to give to the Coleopterous Order marked\r\npreponderance in the immense series of insects. Many more have been\r\ncollected than any one has as yet been enabled to describe; and the\r\ncollections are encumbered with species of which no naturalist has yet\r\ngiven an account.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that the first-rate collections contain each about 25,000\r\nperfectly distinct species, and that a certain fraction of these\r\ntreasures is peculiar to each collection, M. Blanchard came to the\r\nconclusion that we must estimate the number at more than 100,000 of\r\nthe species of Coleoptera which would be obtained if the different\r\nentomological collections of France, England, and Germany were put\r\ntogether. But every day we see arriving from different regions of the\r\nglobe new riches, hardly dreamt of up to that time; and it is not only\r\nthe small species, but the larger and more beautiful also, which\r\nfurnish their contingent. It may, then, be believed that, if the\r\nentire surface of the earth were carefully explored, we should\r\nobtain an incalculable number of Coleoptera, having sufficient\r\ncharacteristics to constitute distinct species or kinds.\r\n\r\nThe Coleoptera (from [Greek: koleos], a sheath, and [Greek: pteron], a\r\nwing) are insects with four wings. The anterior wings, or _elytra_,\r\nare not used in flying; they are sheaths, more or less hard, sometimes\r\nvaried with bright colours, and never crossing over each other. The\r\nposterior wings are membranous, presenting a ramification of veins,\r\nand usually folding up under the _elytra_, which protect them when at\r\nrest. The mouth of Coleoptera is provided with mandibles, with jaws,\r\nand two quite distinct lips, and is suited for mastication. They\r\nundergo complete metamorphosis. After an existence of greater or less\r\nextent in the larva state (in the case of the cockchafer three\r\nyears), the insect changes into a pupa, which remains in a state of\r\ncomplete immobility. After a certain time, the pupa bursts its\r\nenvelope and assumes the form of a perfect insect. The Coleoptera\r\npresents the utmost variety of habits as regards their habitations and\r\nfood. One does not find in this Order those admirable instincts, those\r\nmanifestations of intelligence, which bring certain Hymenoptera near\r\nto those beings which are highest in the animal scale; but they offer\r\npeculiarities very well deserving serious and profound study. Some are\r\ncarnivorous, and thus they are useful to man in destroying other\r\nnoxious insects, which they seek on the ground, on low plants, on\r\ntrees, and even in the depths of the waters. Many of these Coleoptera\r\nfeed on animal matter in a state of putrefaction. We may look on them\r\nas useful auxiliaries: they are Nature's undertakers.\r\n\r\nA great number live in the excrements of animals. The dung of oxen,\r\nbuffaloes, and camels afford shelter to Coleoptera of different\r\nfamilies, which thus live on vegetable matter more or less animalised.\r\nOthers attack skins and dried animals in general; and some are the pest\r\nof entomological collections. Lastly, immense legions of Coleoptera are\r\nphytophagous; that is to say, they attack roots, bark, wood, leaves, and\r\nfruits, and cause much annoyance to the agriculturist. Above all, the\r\nlarvæ are to be dreaded. Those which live in wood may in a few years\r\noccasion the loss of trees, vigorous and full of life; or completely\r\ndestroy the beams of a building. Certain larvæ, such as those of the\r\ncockchafer, eat away the roots of vegetables, and so destroy the\r\nharvests. Others, lastly, devour the leaves and the stalks of plants,\r\nattack the flowers in the gardens, or the corn in the barns; and so man\r\nmakes desperate war against them.\r\n\r\nIn the immense variety of known Coleoptera we must be contented to\r\nchoose those types which are most prominent and most characteristic.\r\nWe will begin with the _Scarabæides_, with their heavy compact body,\r\nand short antennæ, terminated by a foliaceous club. It is to this\r\ntribe that belongs the beautiful Rose Beetle (_Cetonia aurata_), which\r\nlives on roses; the Cockchafer (_Melolontha vulgaris_); the\r\n_Scarabæus_ of the Egyptians; &c.\r\n\r\nThis is the most interesting tribe of the whole Order Coleoptera. It\r\ncorresponds with the great division of the _Lamellicornes_ of\r\nLatreille. This name of _Lamellicornes_ was intended to remind us of\r\nthe arrangement into laminæ, more or less close together, of the club\r\nof the antennæ of these insects. Many _Scarabæi_ have their mandibles\r\nmembranous, or at least partially so, and always small. This\r\npeculiarity corresponds to their habits. Never, indeed, have they to\r\ntriturate hard bodies; they all feed either on flowers, on leaves, or\r\non stercoraceous matter. Their larvæ resemble each other much, even\r\nthose of families very widely differing from each other in the perfect\r\nstate. They are large, whitish worms, with diaphanous skins, scaly\r\nheads, furnished with toothed mandibles, living in the ground or in\r\nrotten wood. The pupæ are fat and stumpy, and they already show the\r\nfeatures of the perfect insect. They make a chamber in which to\r\nundergo their changes. They remain generally three years in the larva\r\nstate. The duration of the pupa is very short, as also is that of the\r\nperfect insect. The differences of the sexes are often very marked on\r\nthe exterior, by protuberances, horns, &c., which constitute the\r\ndistinctive ornament of the males.\r\n\r\nIn the group of _Scarabæides_ we shall have to speak, above all, of\r\nthe _Cetoniadæ_, the Chafers, and the _Scarabæi_ properly so called.\r\nThe family _Cetoniadæ_ is one of the most remarkable, on account of\r\nthe beauty of the insects which compose it and of the richness of\r\ntheir metallic lustre, some being of great splendour, and others\r\nhaving velvety tints. The larvæ live in wood in a state of\r\ndecomposition; the perfect insects frequent flowers, and like the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423.--Rose Beetle (_Cetonia aurata_).]\r\n\r\nThis family contains a great number of species, the type of which is\r\nthe Rose Beetle (_Cetonia aurata_), of a beautiful green colour shot\r\nwith gold, with transverse whitish lines. The rose beetle frequents\r\nroses especially, of which it eats the petals and the stamens. It is\r\nthe _Golden Melolontha_ of Aristotle, who tells us that this\r\nunfortunate insect shared with the cockchafer the privilege of amusing\r\nchildren. The _Cetonia_ flies by day and by night, making use of its\r\ninferior wings without opening the elytra (Fig. 423). When seized, it\r\npours out from the extremity of its abdomen a foetid liquid, the\r\nonly means of defence the poor insect possesses. The larva (Fig. 424)\r\nmuch resembles the larva of the cockchafers, but the legs are shorter.\r\nIt is found in rotten wood, and often in ants' nests. When it has\r\nacquired its full development it makes a cocoon of an oval form (Fig.\r\n424), in which it transforms itself into a pupa; the cocoon is\r\ncomposed of bits of wood agglomerated with a silky matter which the\r\nlarva secretes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424.--Larva and cocoon of the Rose Beetle.]\r\n\r\nThe larva of the _Cetonia splendidula_--which is the most magnificent\r\nfound in France--is met with sometimes in the nests of wild bees. In\r\nRussia the rose beetle is considered a very efficacious remedy for\r\nhydrophobia. In the governorship of Saratow, which is traversed by the\r\nVolga, hydrophobia is very frequent, on account of the heats which\r\nreign during the whole summer in its arid steppes. The inhabitants,\r\nincessantly exposed to be bitten by mad dogs, have tried in succession\r\na great many preparations to remedy the results of these terrible\r\naccidents. It appears that the _Cetonia_, dried and reduced to powder,\r\nhas produced on many occasions good effects. This is the recipe which\r\nan inhabitant of Saratow published in a Russian journal--adding, that\r\nhe had employed it for thirty years, that not one of the patients\r\ntreated by him had died, and that his remedy could be employed with\r\nsuccess in all the phases of the disease:--In spring they search at\r\nthe bottom of the nests of the wood ant for certain white larvæ, which\r\nthey carefully preserve in a pot, together with the earth in which\r\nthey were found, till the moment of their metamorphosis, which takes\r\nplace in the month of May. The insect, which is the common rose\r\nbeetle, is killed, dried, and kept in pots hermetically sealed, so\r\nthat it may preserve the strong odour which it exhales in spring,\r\nwhich seems to be a necessary condition of the remedy proving\r\nefficient. When a case of hydrophobia presents itself, they reduce to\r\npowder some of these, and spread this powder on a piece of\r\nbread-and-butter, and make the patient eat it. Every part of the\r\ninsect must enter into the composition of this powder, which, for this\r\nreason, cannot be very fine. During the whole time a patient is under\r\ntreatment he must avoid drinking as much as possible, or, if his\r\nthirst is very great, he must only drink a little pure water; but he\r\nmay eat. Generally, this remedy produces sleep, which may last for\r\nthirty-six hours, and which must not be disturbed. When the patient\r\nwakes, he is, they say, cured. The bite must be treated locally with\r\nthe usual surgical appliances.\r\n\r\nAs to the dose of the remedy, that depends on the age of the patient\r\nand the development of the disease. They give, to an adult,\r\nimmediately after the bite, from two to three beetles; to a child,\r\nfrom one to two; to a person in whom the disease has already declared\r\nitself, from four to five. Given to a person in good health, the\r\nremedy, however, would not be the least dangerous. In cases in which\r\nthe symptoms of hydrophobia show themselves some days after the\r\nemployment of the remedy, they recommence the treatment. They have\r\nalso tried to prepare this remedy with insects collected not in their\r\nlarvæ but in the imago state, by catching them on flowers, and it\r\nseems that these attempts have succeeded. According to M. Bogdanoff,\r\nin many governorships of the south of Russia the lovers of sporting\r\nare in the habit of making their dogs from time to time swallow (as a\r\npreservative) half of a _Cetonia_ with bread or a little wine. Every\r\none in those countries is persuaded of the efficacy of this means for\r\nstopping the development of the disease. One ought not, perhaps, to\r\nreject a belief so widespread and deeply rooted without some\r\nexperiments to guarantee us in doing so, for medicine does not yet\r\npossess any remedy against hydrophobia: it might not then be useless\r\nto try this.\r\n\r\nTwo smaller species than the rose beetle, the _Cetonia stictica_ and\r\nthe _Cetonia hirtella_, which has yellowish hairs, live on the flowers\r\nof thistles. Western Africa, the Cape, Madagascar, &c., are very rich\r\nin species of _Cetoniæ_. Among the _Cetoniadæ_ is the genus\r\n_Goliathus_, gigantic insects which inhabit Africa. Their total length\r\nsometimes attains from three to five inches. Their colours are\r\ngenerally a dull white or yellow, which has nothing metallic about it,\r\nwith spots of a velvety black--these are due to a sort of down of an\r\nextreme thinness, and which very easily comes off. The head of these\r\nenormous Coleoptera is generally cut or scooped out, and is adorned\r\nsometimes with one or two horns. Their legs, strong and robust, are\r\narmed with spurs, and sometimes present on their exterior sharp\r\nindentations, which give to these insects a crabbed physiognomy, which\r\ntheir inoffensive habits are far from justifying. All these horns, and\r\nall these teeth, which look so terrible, are nothing, in fact, with a\r\ngreat number of these insects, but simple ornaments. They compose the\r\npicturesque uniform of the males. They are equivalent to the bear-skin\r\ncaps, the flaming helmets, and the bullion-fringed epaulettes of our\r\nsoldiers. The dress of the female _Goliathus_ is much more modest, as\r\nis becoming to the sex. We here represent the _Goliathus Derbyana_\r\n(Fig. 426) and Polyphemus (Fig. 427).\r\n\r\nThe Goliaths were formerly excessively rare in collections, and of a\r\nprice inaccessible to ordinary amateurs--one single specimen costing\r\nas much as twenty pounds. But for some time the Goliaths of the coast\r\nof Guinea and of Cape Palmas have been sold to European amateurs at a\r\nmodest price, thanks to those travellers who, after the example of Dr.\r\nSavage, have collected them by hundreds in the countries which produce\r\nthem. These enormous Coleoptera are seen on the coast of Guinea\r\nfluttering about at the top of trees, the flowers of which they are\r\nseeking after. To catch them the trees are felled or else they are\r\nshot at with a gun loaded with sand, as is also done for the\r\nhumming-birds. The species which Dr. Savage made common is the\r\n_Goliathus cacicus_, of which we represent the male and female (Figs.\r\n428, 429). It is met with on the coast of Guinea. The _Goliathus\r\nDruryi_ (Fig. 430) inhabits Sierra Leone, on the west coast of Guinea.\r\nThe numerous expeditions which are at the present moment being made\r\ninto the interior of Africa will not fail to increase the number of\r\nspecies of these splendid insects, which are the ornament of all\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 425.--Cetonia argentea.]\r\n\r\nThe group of the _Trichiadæ_, which has in this country and in France\r\na few representatives, is very nearly the same as that of the\r\n_Cetoniadæ_. The _Trichiadæ_ have the elytra shorter, the abdomen\r\nbigger, and the legs more slender. The _Trichius fasciatus_, which is\r\nblack, and covered with an ashy down, with the elytra yellow, and with\r\nthree black bands, is to be met with in quantities on the garden\r\nrose-tree, in the months of June and July. The larvæ live in the\r\ninterior of old beams of wood, respecting their surfaces. In a garden,\r\nat a few leagues from Paris, a little wooden bridge had been built. It\r\nseemed on the outside to be in a perfect state of preservation.\r\nNothing on the exterior would have led one to think it was possible\r\nfor the oak timbers which composed it to break down. A good many of\r\nthem, however, broke suddenly. It was then seen that the wood had been\r\nscooped out right up to the surface, which was nothing better than a\r\nthin sheet, of an imperceptible thinness. All the interior was full of\r\n_Trichii_, in the states of larva, pupa, and perfect insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 426.--Goliathus Derbyana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 427.--Goliathus Polyphemus.]\r\n\r\nThe _Trichius fasciatus_, sometimes called the Bee Beetle, is very\r\ncommon in the environs of Paris. Geoffroy has described it under the\r\nrather quaint name of the \"Livrée d'Ancre,\" because the Marquis of\r\nAncre made his servants wear yellow coats, bordered by braid\r\nalternately crossed with green and yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 428.--Goliathus cacicus, male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 429.--Goliathus cacicus, female.]\r\n\r\nThe _Osmoderma eremita_ is a large insect, of purple colour,\r\nformerly common in the environs of Paris, and which, now-a-days,\r\ncannot be found nearer than Fontainebleau. One must look for them in\r\nearth which fills up the cavity of old willows or of pear trees. The\r\nsmell of Russia leather, or of plum, which it exhales, has caused it\r\nto be called, in some places, the Plum-tree Beetle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 430.--Goliathus Druryi (natural size).]\r\n\r\nThe _Gnorimus nobilis_ much resembles the rose beetle, and is found on\r\nelder flowers, the whiteness of which this golden insect relieves. One\r\nspecies, much smaller, only one or two lines long, is the _Valgus\r\nhemipterus_, which is often met with in spring, in the dust of the\r\nroads. The female has a long auger, which enables it to deposit its\r\neggs in rotten wood. Dumeril has described at length the singular\r\nmovements of this little insect:--The jerking and, as it were\r\nconvulsive, movements by which it transports itself from one place to\r\nanother; its tottering attitude, resulting from the excessive length\r\nof its hind legs; the vertical carriage of these, which, by their\r\nsingular direction, interfere much with the walking, which is directed\r\nby the other legs. One should, above all, notice the artifice which\r\nthe _Valgus_ employs, as indeed do many Coleoptera, to escape from his\r\npersecutors, by counterfeiting death. As soon as it is seized by any\r\nenemy, its members stiffen and become motionless. The body, abandoned\r\nto itself, lies unevenly on whatever side it falls, for its legs no\r\nlonger bend; if you bend them over, they remain in the inclination\r\ngiven to them. Nothing then betrays life in this little dry and\r\nslender being, frozen with fear, and imitating death, without,\r\nperhaps, being aware itself of what it is doing.\r\n\r\nWe must still further mention here the _Incas_--beautiful insects of\r\nthe same group, which are met with in South America, and whose males\r\nhave an extraordinary head. They fly during the day round the great\r\ntrees on which they live. Fig. 431 represents the _Inca clathrata_.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly-known insect of the family with which we are now\r\noccupied is the cockchafer. The French word for cockchafer,\r\n_hanneton_, according to M. Mulsant, comes from the Latin, _alitonus_\r\n(which has sonorous wings), which first became _halleton_. Linnæus\r\ngave them first the name of _Melolontha_, which they probably had\r\namong the Greeks, and which seems to be the case from this passage in\r\nAristophanes, in his comedy of \"The Clouds:\"--\"Let your spirit soar,\"\r\nsays the Greek author, \"let it fly whither it lists, like the\r\nMelolontha tied with a thread by the leg.\" We see that the habit of\r\nmartyrising cockchafers is of very early date. The Common Cockchafer\r\n(Fig. 432) is one of the greatest pests to agriculture. In its perfect\r\nstate it devours the leaves of many trees, principally those of the\r\nelm; and so children call the fruit of the elm-tree by the name of\r\n\"Pains d'Hanneton.\" But the destruction which they occasion in their\r\nperfect state is little when compared with that which is caused by\r\ntheir larvæ--those white grubs so dreaded by agriculturists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 431.--Inca clathrata.]\r\n\r\nCockchafers make their appearance from the month of April, if the\r\nseason is warm. But it is in the month of May that they show\r\nthemselves in great quantities; and so they are called in Germany\r\n_Maikäfer_ (Maychafer). They are met with also in June. The duration\r\nof their life as a perfect insect is six weeks. They fear the heat of\r\nthe day and the bright sunshine, so, during the day, they remain\r\nhooked on to the under surface of leaves. It is only early in the\r\nmorning, and at sunset, that one sees the cockchafers fluttering round\r\nthe trees which they frequent. They fly with rapidity, producing a\r\nmonotonous sound by the friction of their wings. But the cockchafer\r\nsteers badly when it flies; it knocks itself at each instant against\r\nobstacles it meets with. It then falls heavily to the ground, and\r\nbecomes the plaything of children, who are constantly on the look-out\r\nfor them. There is a saying, \"Étourdi comme un hanneton.\" What\r\ncontributes still more to render the flight of these insects heavy and\r\nsustained only for a short time together is that they are obliged to\r\ninflate themselves like balloons in order to rise into the air: it is\r\na peculiarity which they share with the migratory locust. Before\r\ntaking its flight, the cockchafer agitates its wings for some minutes,\r\nand inflates its abdomen with air. The French children, who perceive\r\nthis manoeuvre, say that the cockchafer \"compte ses écus\" (is\r\ncounting its money), and they sing to it this refrain, which has been\r\nhanded down for many generations:--\r\n\r\n  \"Hanneton, vole, vole,\r\n  Va-t'en à l'école.\"\r\n\r\nA variation which we hear in the western provinces of France is the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  \"Barbot, vole, vole, vole,\r\n    Ton père est à l'école,\r\n  Qui m'a dit, si tu ne voles,\r\n    Il te coupera la gorge\r\n  Avec un grand couteau de Saint-George.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 432.--Cockchafer (_Melolontha vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nDuring the day the cockchafers remain under the leaves in a state of\r\nperfect immobility; for the heat which gives activity to other\r\ninsects, seems, on the contrary, to stupefy them, and it is during the\r\nnight only that they devour the leaves of elms, poplars, oaks, beech,\r\nbirch-trees, &c. In years when their number is not very great, one\r\nhardly perceives the damage done by them; but at certain periods they\r\nappear in innumerable legions, and then whole parts of gardens or\r\nwoods are stripped of their verdure, and present, in the middle of the\r\nsummer, the appearance of a winter landscape. The trees thus stripped\r\ndo not in general die; but they recover their former vigour with\r\ndifficulty, and, in the case of orchard trees, remain one or two years\r\nwithout bearing fruit. It is principally the trees skirting woods, and\r\nsituated along cultivated fields, which are exposed to the ravages of\r\nthe cockchafer, because the larvæ of these insects are developed in\r\nthe fields. In the interior of forests they are never met with in\r\ngreat numbers.\r\n\r\nIn certain years cockchafers multiply in such a frightful manner\r\nthat they devastate the whole vegetation of a country. In the environs\r\nof Blois 14,000 cockchafers were picked up by children in a few days.\r\nAt Fontainebleau they could have gathered as many in a certain year\r\nin as many hours. Sometimes they congregate in swarms, like locusts,\r\nand migrate from one locality to another, when they lay waste\r\neverything. To present an idea of the prodigious extent to which\r\ncockchafers increase under certain circumstances, we will give a few\r\nstatistics:--In 1574, these insects were so abundant in England that\r\nthey stopped many mills on the Severn. In 1688, in the county of\r\nGalway, in Ireland, they formed such a black cloud that the sky was\r\ndarkened for the distance of a league, and the country people had\r\ngreat difficulty in making their hay in the places where they\r\nalighted. They destroyed the whole of the vegetation in such a way\r\nthat the landscape assumed the desolate appearance of winter. Their\r\nvoracious jaws made a noise which may be compared to that produced by\r\nthe sawing of a large piece of wood, and in the evening the buzzing of\r\ntheir wings resembled the distant rolling of drums. The unfortunate\r\nIrish were reduced to the necessity of cooking their invaders, and,\r\nfor the want of any other food, of eating them. In 1804, immense\r\nswarms of cockchafers, precipitated by a violent wind into the Lake of\r\nZurich, formed on the shore a thick bank of bodies heaped up one on\r\nthe other, the putrid exhalations from which poisoned the atmosphere.\r\nOn May 18, 1832, at nine o'clock in the evening, a legion of\r\ncockchafers assailed a diligence on the road from Gournay to Gisors,\r\njust as it was leaving the village of Talmontiers; the horses, blinded\r\nand terrified, refused to advance, and the driver was obliged to\r\nreturn as far as the village, to wait till this new sort of hail-storm\r\nwas over. M. Mulsant, in his \"Monographie des Lamellicornes de la\r\nFrance,\" relates that in May, 1841, clouds of cockchafers traversed\r\nthe Saône, from the south-east in the direction of the north-west, and\r\nsettled in the vineyards of the Mâconnais. The streets of the town of\r\nMâcon were so full of them, that they were shovelled up with spades.\r\nAt certain hours, one could not pass over the bridge without whirling\r\na stick rapidly round and round, to protect oneself against their\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XI. A Diligence surrounded by a Cloud of Cockchafers.]\r\n\r\nThe coupling takes place towards the end of May, after which the males\r\ndie; the females only surviving them from the time necessary to ensure\r\nthe propagation of the species. The number of eggs which a female lays\r\nis from twenty to thirty. With her front leg she hollows out a hole in\r\nthe ground from two to four inches in depth, and deposits her eggs, of\r\na yellowish white and of the size of hemp-seed, therein. Her instinct\r\nleads her to choose soft, light, and well-manured soils, which are, at\r\nthe same time, the best ventilated and the most fertile. We may\r\nconclude from this that cultivation and labour have made the\r\ncockchafer more common than it was formerly. It is the child of\r\ncivilisation, the parasite of agriculture. In from four to six weeks\r\nafter being laid, the little larvæ are hatched (Fig. 433), and\r\nimmediately attack the roots of vegetables. They have a hard and\r\nhorny head, and slender black legs, longer than in any other species\r\nof _Scarabæides_. Their body is composed of a whitish pulp under a\r\ntransparent skin; the head and the mouth have a reddish tinge. The\r\nlength of their existence in this state is three, sometimes four\r\nyears. From the egg laid in the month of June is hatched a larva, in\r\nthe month of July. It increases in size during the last six months of\r\nthe year, and continues to do so during the two following years,\r\nchanging its skin many times during the period. Towards the end of the\r\nthird year it changes into a pupa, after having surrounded itself with\r\na cocoon consolidated with a glutinous froth and some threads of silk.\r\nThe pupa (Fig. 434) is of a pale russety yellow, with two little\r\npoints at the extremity of its body; the elytra and the wings, lying\r\ndown, cover the legs and the antennæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 434.--Pupa of the Cockchafer (_Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 433.--Larva of the Cockchafer (_Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October the perfect insect is already marked out,\r\nbut it is still soft and weak. It passes the winter in its\r\nhiding-place, hardens and becomes coloured at the end of the winter,\r\nand shows itself by degrees on the surface of the ground. In the month\r\nof April, three years after its birth, the cockchafer emerges from the\r\nearth, and commences its attack on the leaves of trees. This long\r\nduration of the development of the insect explains why we do not see\r\nthem every year in the same number. When they have once appeared in\r\ngreat quantities, it is not for three years afterwards that we need\r\nexpect to see their progeny again in proportionate numbers. It is,\r\nthen, every three years that we have a _cockchafer year_ like 1865,\r\nbut in the intermediate years they are never very abundant. For the\r\nfirst year the little larvæ do not eat much. They feed then\r\nprincipally on fragments of dung, and on vegetable detritus, and keep\r\ntogether in families. In winter they bury themselves deeply, so as to\r\nbe secure against frost and floods. Next spring the want of a greater\r\nabundance of food forces them to disperse. They then make subterranean\r\ngalleries in all directions, without, however, going far from the\r\nplace where they were hatched. They begin attacking the roots which\r\nthey find within their reach; the damage they do increasing with their\r\nsize and the strength of their mandibles. Among roots, they seem to\r\nprefer those of the strawberry and of rose-trees; but they do not\r\ndespise other vegetables, and attack legumes and cereals as well as\r\nbushes and plants. The ravages which they occasion are sometimes\r\nincalculable; market gardens are sometimes entirely devastated. Fields\r\nof lucerne have been seen partially destroyed by them; meadows of\r\ngreat extent lose their pasturage; oat fields die off before they have\r\ncome to maturity; and many of the ears of corn fall before they are\r\ncut.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as they increase in age and in strength--especially in\r\ntheir last year--do they attack also ligneous vegetation. When they\r\nhave gnawed away the lateral roots of a young tree, the new shoots\r\ncorresponding to them dry up. The larvæ then attack the principal\r\nroot, and thus bring about the death of the tree. There will be found\r\nround the roots of trees thus attacked immense numbers of these worms.\r\nM. Deschiens relates that he had seen six hectares of acorns, sown\r\nthree times in the space of five years with a perfect result, entirely\r\ndestroyed as many times by the larvæ of the cockchafer. A nurseryman\r\nof Bourg-la-Reine suffered, in 1854, from the ravages of these\r\nterrible larvæ, losses which he estimated at 30,000 francs. Others\r\nonly preserved about a hundredth part of their plants. In Prussia they\r\ndestroyed, in 1835, a considerable nursery of trees in the _Institut\r\nForestier_. In the forests of Kolbetz more than a thousand measures of\r\nwild pines were destroyed in the same way.\r\n\r\nWe shall not, then, be surprised to learn that the thunders of\r\nexcommunication were formerly launched at the cockchafers, as they\r\nwere also at the caterpillars and the locusts. We do not know whether\r\nthis had much impression upon them. In 1479, the cockchafers having\r\noccasioned a famine in the country, were cited before the ecclesiastical\r\ntribunal of Lausanne. The advocate (Fribourg) who defended them, did not\r\nfind, doubtlessly, in the resources of his eloquence arguments powerful\r\nenough in their favour; for the tribunal, after mature deliberation,\r\ncondemned the accused troop, and sentenced them to be banished from the\r\nterritory. But it is not enough to pass a sentence--there must also be\r\nthe means of putting it in execution; and these were wanting to the\r\ntribunal of Lausanne. And so the condemned cockchafers continued to live\r\non Swiss land, without appearing mindful of the condemnation which had\r\nbeen fulminated against them.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the cockchafer are not easily destroyed. They\r\nsuccessfully resist those scourges which one fancies must harm them.\r\nThus, the inundation which devastated the banks of the Saône, fifteen\r\nyears ago, had no effect on them. The land and meadows, which had\r\nremained for from four to five weeks under water, were none the more\r\nrid of them. The only circumstance which is really hurtful to them,\r\nand to the adult cockchafer, is late frost in the months of April and\r\nMay. When these frosts come after mild weather, they surprise the\r\nlarvæ at the surface of the soil, and kill them. Unfortunately, the\r\nsame causes do harm to the plants which have already begun to spring\r\nup. Nature has not, then, sufficiently provided the means of\r\ndestroying these mischievous beings. One would say that she had not\r\nforeseen their extraordinary multiplication, which has been, we must\r\nconfess, encouraged by agriculture and by the cultivation of the land.\r\n\r\nAnimals do not contribute much towards limiting the number of\r\ncockchafers, although the latter are not wanting in natural enemies.\r\nAmong insects, it is the large species of _Carabus_ which search after\r\nthe larvæ as well as the adult cockchafers. The _Carabus auratus_\r\nattacks them with great coolness. M. Blanchard saw a carabus seize a\r\ncockchafer in the middle of the road, open its belly with its\r\nmandibles, and devour its intestines. The cockchafer tossed about from\r\none side to the other, and even walked, while it was undergoing its\r\ncruel punishment; and the _Carabus_ followed it without interrupting\r\nits work. Some reptiles, many carnivorous animals, such as the\r\nshrew-mouse, pole-cats, weasels, rats, and certain birds, especially\r\nthe night-birds, prey upon the cockchafer and its larvæ. Ravens and\r\nmagpies, which are seen going from clod to clod, make savage but\r\ninsufficient war against them. In fact, all these animals together do\r\nnot destroy the hundredth part of the cockchafers which are born every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAs an example which will show the extent of the evil, a field of 29\r\nacres was ploughed up into 72 furrows. At the first ploughing were\r\ngathered 300 larvæ per furrow; at the second, 250; at the third, 30\r\nmore; which amounted to 600 per furrow, and to 43,200 in all. Man, who\r\nis the victim of these ravages, has been necessarily obliged to think\r\nof a means of destroying this enemy. Many _infallible_ means have been\r\nproposed, which have, however, given no result. Prizes have been\r\noffered, but the evil has not diminished. Here are a few of the\r\nprocesses recommended.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the ploughing, you must turn into the field infested\r\nby the larvæ a flock of turkeys, to whom it will be a great treat to\r\ndevour them, or else you must sow in the field rape-seed, very\r\nthickly, which you must then bury by a very deep ploughing, when it is\r\nas high as your hand. Colewort, it is said, kills the larvæ, while it\r\nat the same time manures the soil. Or again, you must plough up the\r\nland on the approach of hard frosts, to expose the worms to the cold.\r\nLastly, you can water the field with oil of coal, or sprinkle it with\r\nashes of boxwood. All these are expensive. The simplest means are here\r\nthe best. It is better to depend upon labour than destructive\r\nsubstances, whose employment always presents inconveniences.\r\nConsidering the difficulties which oppose themselves to us in our\r\nsearch after larvæ, we had better collect them in their adult state by\r\nviolently shaking the branches of the trees on which they doze during\r\nthe day, and then kill them in some way or other, thus destroying from\r\ntwenty to forty eggs with each female. A general cockchafer hunt,\r\nrendered obligatory by a law, and encouraged by prizes, would be the\r\nonly efficacious means of opposing a pest which costs agriculture many\r\nmillions. This means would also be less costly than the turning up of\r\nthe land concealing the larvæ, when it is remembered that they prefer\r\nland in full bearing.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 the General Council of La Sarthe voted a sum of 20,000 francs\r\nfor a cockchafer hunt. Nearly 600,000 litres were delivered in, thanks\r\nto a prize of three centimes per litre. As a litre contains about 500\r\ncockchafers, there were thus destroyed about 300,000,000 of them. It\r\nis true that M. Romieu, then Prefect of La Sarthe, who was the\r\nprincipal promoter of this excellent measure, became food for the wit\r\nof the newspapers, and was represented dressed like a cockchafer in\r\nthe _Charivari_. Derision and ridicule are too often the reward of\r\nuseful ideas. In Switzerland were taken, in 1807, more than\r\n150,000,000 of these insects. But these isolated measures were useless\r\nin producing a durable result.\r\n\r\nIt has been tried to make use of cockchafers in industrial arts.\r\nAccording to M. Farkas, they have succeeded, in Hungary, by boiling\r\nthem in water, in extracting from them an oil, which is used to grease\r\nthe wheels of carriages; and, according to M. Mulsant, the blackish\r\nliquid which is contained in the oesophagus may be used for\r\npainting. But the produce arising from these industrial occupations is\r\nnot considerable enough to ensure them a certain extension, which is\r\nto be regretted, for agriculture would thus be rid of one of its most\r\nformidable scourges. Poultry are sometimes fed on these insects; pigs\r\nare also very fond of them.\r\n\r\nThe _Melolontha Hippocastani_ differs from the common species in\r\nhaving black legs. The _Melolontha fullo_, twice as large as the\r\ncommon species, is variegated with tawny and white. It is met with on\r\nthe sea-coasts, and on the downs of the north and south of France, as\r\nits larvæ feed on the roots of maritime plants.\r\n\r\nAmong the genera very near to the cockchafer we will mention the\r\nlittle _Rhizotrogus_, light-coloured and hairy, which flies in the\r\nevening in the meadows, and the _Euchloras_, or _Anomalas_, of\r\nsplendid metallic colours. The _Anomala vitis_ is an insect of about\r\nhalf an inch long, of a beautiful green, bordered by yellow, with the\r\nelytra deeply furrowed. It sometimes causes extensive ravages in the\r\nvineyards.\r\n\r\nAfter the _Cetoniadæ_ and the Cockchafers, we come to the\r\n_Scarabæidæ_, properly so called. The _Oryctes nasicornis_ (Fig. 435)\r\nis very common all over Europe. It is about an inch long, of a\r\nchestnut-brown, and perfectly smooth. The male has on the head a horn,\r\nwhich is wanting in the female (Figs. 436, 437). Its larva, which is a\r\ngreat whitish worm, larger than that of the cockchafer, lives in\r\nrotten wood and in the tan which is employed in hot-houses and in\r\ngarden-frames. They were to be found by hundreds in the old hot-houses\r\nof the Jardin des Plantes at Paris. The market-gardeners, who employ\r\nthe tannin of the oak bark, have rendered this Coleopteron very common\r\nin the environs of that capital. Fig. 438 represents an exotic\r\nspecies, the _Xylotrupes dichotomus_.\r\n\r\nAmong the true _Scarabæi_ we meet with many species of gigantic size,\r\nespecially in America. _Dynastes Hercules_, a great insect of a fine\r\nebony black, with its elytra of an olive grey, is not rare in the\r\nAntilles. Its thorax is prolonged into a horn as long as its body, and\r\nbent round at the extremity; its head has also a long horn standing\r\nerect. The females want these appendages. Fig. 439 represents the\r\n_Golofa claviger_ of Guyana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 436.--Head of Oryctes nasicornis, male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 435.--Oryctes nasicornis, male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 437.--Head of Oryctes nasicornis, female.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 438.--Xylotrupes dichotomus.]\r\n\r\nThe _Geotrupes_ are insects almost as common as the chafers. As their\r\nname reminds us, they make holes in the ground, which they scoop out,\r\nparticularly in meadows, under cow-dung which has grown dry on the\r\nsurface. It is under the excrements of ruminating animals and horses\r\nthat they must be looked for. They fly especially at night, and may be\r\nseen buzzing about on fine summer evenings in the vicinity of dung\r\nheaps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 439.--Golofa claviger.]\r\n\r\nThe _Geotrupes stercorarius_, the Shard-born Beetle, Clock, or\r\nDumbledor, is of a brilliant bluish black, and attains to a length of\r\nabout two-thirds of an inch. We may consider this Coleopteron as a\r\nuseful auxiliary of man in ridding the soil of excrementitious matter.\r\nThe genus _Trox_, which belongs to the same group, generally inhabits\r\nsandy countries, and has its body nearly always covered with earth or\r\ndust; it lives on vegetable substances, or on animal matter in a state\r\nof decomposition. The habits of the genus _Copris_ resemble those of\r\n_Geotrupes_; they live in excrement. The form of their clypeus, broad,\r\nrounded, without teeth, and advancing over the mouth, suffices to\r\ndistinguish the kindred species. In the environs of Paris and in\r\nEngland the _Copris lunaris_ is found. The larvæ of these insects form\r\na cocoon composed of earth and dung, before transforming themselves\r\ninto pupæ; this cocoon is more or less round, and acquires a great\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\nThe species of the genus _Ateuchus_ collect portions of excrement,\r\nwhich they make up into balls, and roll till they are as perfectly\r\nrounded as pills, and in which they lay their eggs. This habit has\r\ngained for these insects the name of pill-makers. Their hind legs seem\r\nto be particularly adapted for this operation, for they are very long\r\nand somewhat distant from the other legs, which gives to the\r\n_Ateuchi_ a strange appearance, and makes it hard work for them to\r\nwalk. They walk backwards and often fall head over heels. They are\r\ngenerally seen on declivities exposed to the greatest heat of the\r\nsun, assembled together to the number of four or five, occupied in\r\nrolling the same ball; so that it is impossible to know which is the\r\nreal proprietor of this rolling object. They seem not to know\r\nthemselves; for they roll indifferently the first ball which they meet\r\nwith, or near which they are placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 440.--Scarabæus (Golofa) Porteri.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 441.--Scarabæus enema, or Enema infundibulum.]\r\n\r\nThe _Ateuchi_ are large flat insects, with a broad-toothed clypeus;\r\nthey all belong to the Ancient Continent. The type of the genus is the\r\n_Ateuchus sacer_ (Fig. 442), the Sacred Scarabæus of the Egyptians.\r\nThis insect is black, and attains to a length of a little less than an\r\ninch. It is to be found commonly enough in the south of France, in the\r\nwhole of southern Europe, Barbary, and Egypt. The paintings and\r\namulets of the ancient Egyptians very often represent it, and\r\nsometimes give it a gigantic size. It is, doubtless, then, this\r\nspecies which was an object of veneration with the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThere exists another species, which is always represented as of a\r\nmagnificent golden green, and to which Herodotus also attributes this\r\ncolour. As it was not to be found in Egypt, it was thought for a long\r\nwhile that the Egyptians had painted the black species of a more\r\nsplendid colour in order to pay it homage. But in 1819 M. Caillaud\r\nactually found at Meroe, on the banks of the White Nile, the _Ateuchus\r\nÆgyptiorum_, which resembles the _Ateuchus sacer_ much in colour, but\r\nhas a golden tint. Since then it has also been brought from Sennaar.\r\nThe two species were both probably sacred. Hor-Apollon, the learned\r\ncommentator on Egyptian hieroglyphics, thinks that this people, in\r\nadopting the scarabæus as a religious symbol, wished to represent at\r\nonce, _a unique birth_--_a father_--_the world_--_a man_. The _unique\r\nbirth_ means that the scarabæus has no mother. A male wishing to\r\nprocreate, said the Egyptians, takes the dung of an ox, works it up\r\ninto a ball, and gives it the shape of the world, rolls it with its\r\nhind legs from east to west, and places it in the ground, where it\r\nremains twenty-eight days; the twenty-ninth day it throws its ball,\r\nnow open, into the water, and there comes forth a male scarabæus. This\r\nexplanation shows also why the scarabæus was employed to represent at\r\nthe same time a _father_, _a man_, and _the world_. There were,\r\nhowever, according to the same author, three sorts of _Scarabæi_: one\r\nwas in the shape of a cat, and threw out brightly shining rays\r\n(probably the Golden Scarabæus, _Ateuchus Ægyptiorum_); the two others\r\nhad horns; their description seems to refer to a _Copris_ and a\r\n_Geotrupes_.\r\n\r\nAs other remarkable species of _Scarabæi_ we represent the _Scarabæus\r\nenema_ (Fig. 441), with strong horns, the _Megacerus chorinæus_ (Fig.\r\n443), the _Megalosoma anubis_ (Figs. 444 and 445), and the _Dynastes\r\nHercules_ (Fig. 446).\r\n\r\nThe last family of the _Scarabæidæ_ contains the _Lucanidæ_, or Stag\r\nBeetles. These Coleoptera are of great size, and their head is armed\r\nwith enormous robust mandibles, which give them a ferocious air, which\r\ntheir inoffensive habits do not in any way justify. They live in\r\nhalf-rotten trees, the destruction of which they accelerate. Their\r\nmandibles, of such prodigious size only in the male, are of more\r\ninconvenience to them than they are of use, as they impede their\r\nflight. Their strength enables them to raise considerable weights, but\r\nthey make no other use of them than to show their strength, which is\r\nenormous. They do not attack other insects, and live only on vegetable\r\njuices.\r\n\r\nThe common Stag Beetle (Figs. 447[121] and 448) attains to a length of\r\ntwo inches, or more, including its mandibles, and is of a dark brown\r\nchestnut colour. They are met with during the months of May, June, and\r\nJuly, in large forests, climbing along trees and hooking themselves on\r\nto the trunks by their mandibles. Charles De Geer says that the Stag\r\nBeetle imbibes the honeyed liquid which is found on oak trees, a tree\r\nit particularly seeks after, which has caused it to be called in\r\nSwedish _Ek-Oxe_ (Oak ox). It is supposed that it eats the leaves\r\nalso. It sometimes attacks insects. Westwood says that it has been\r\nseen to descend from a tree carrying a caterpillar in its mandibles.\r\nSwammerdam had one which followed him like a dog when he offered it\r\nhoney. They only fly in the evening, holding themselves nearly\r\nstraight, so as not to see-saw. Their larvæ--which are whitish, with\r\nrussety heads, live in the interior of trees, their existence in that\r\nstate lasting nearly four years. Many naturalists think that the larva\r\nof the _Lucanus_ was the _Cossus_ of the Romans, which figured on the\r\ntables of the rich patricians, and particularly of Lucullus.\r\n\r\n    [121] The figure may possibly mislead, as it shows the larva\r\n    and pupa in the ground, for although recent observations show\r\n    that this species does occasionally undergo its metamorphoses\r\n    therein, it is not probable that the larva lives anywhere but\r\n    in wood.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 442.--The Sacred Scarabæus of the Egyptians\r\n(_Ateuchus sacer_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 443.--Megacerus chorinæus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 444.--Megalosoma anubis (male).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 445.--Megalosoma anubis (female).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 446.--Dynastes Hercules.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 447.--Common Stag Beetle (_Lucanus cervus_).]\r\n\r\nFig. 448 represents the Stag Beetle (_Lucanus cervus_); Fig. 449, an\r\nexotic species, the _Lucanus (Homoderus) Mellyi_, from the Gabon; Fig.\r\n450 the _Lucanus bellicosus_; and Fig. 451 another exotic species from\r\nCelebes, _Dorcus Titan_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 448.--Stag Beetle (_Lucanus cervus_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 449.--Lucanus (Homoderus) Mellyi.]\r\n\r\nThe _Syndesus cornutus_ (Fig. 452) of Tasmania, and the _Chiasognathus\r\nGrantii_, from the coast of Chili (Fig. 453), of a beautiful golden\r\ngreen, shot with copper, belong to genera akin to _Lucanus_.\r\n\r\nWe arrive now at the tribe of _Silphales_, which are still more useful\r\nto man than the Dung Beetles (_Scarabæidæ_), since many of them\r\ndisencumber the soil of the carcases of animals in a state of\r\nputrefaction. The most remarkable insects of this tribe are the\r\n_Histers_, the _Silphas_, properly so called, and the _Necrophora_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 450.--Lucanus bellicosus.]\r\n\r\nThe _Histers_ are small insects, to be recognised by their body being\r\nalmost round, smooth, and shining, with the elytra marked with striæ,\r\nand their mandibles pretty well developed. They attain to a length of\r\nabout a fifth of an inch. The _Silphæ_, thus named on account of their\r\nbroad and rounded form, are of a large size (about half to\r\nthree-quarters of an inch), of a dark colour, and exhale a sickly\r\nodour. When seized, they disgorge a blackish liquid. They introduce\r\nthemselves under the skin of the carcases of animals, and devour their\r\nflesh to the very bone. The larvæ, flat and serrated, live like the\r\nadults, in carrion. The commonest species is the _Silpha obscura_, of\r\nan intense black, delicately dotted. Two species found in England and\r\nin the environs of Paris, _Silpha quadripunctata_ and the _Silpha\r\nthoracica_, climb trees and attack caterpillars. It appears to be\r\ncertain that the larva of the _Silpha obscura_ does a great deal of\r\ndamage to beet-root, whose leaves it devours. The _Necrodes_ come very\r\nnear to the _Silphæ_. They are distinguished from them by having the\r\nhind legs larger. Only one, _Necrodes littoralis_, occurs in England.\r\nFig. 459 represents the _Necrodes lacrymosa_, from Australia. The\r\n_Necrophori_, or Grave-diggers, are honest undertakers, who carefully\r\nbury carcases left on the soil. As soon as they smell a field-mouse, a\r\nmole, or a fish in a state of decomposition, they come by troops to\r\nbury it, getting under the carcase, hollowing out the ground with\r\ntheir legs, and projecting the rubbish they dig out in all directions.\r\nLittle by little the carcase sinks; at the end of twenty-four hours it\r\nhas generally disappeared into a hole five inches in depth, but the\r\n_Necrophori_ sink it still lower--as far as from seven to ten inches\r\nbelow the surface. They then mount it, cast the earth down into the\r\ngrave so as to fill it, and the females lay their eggs in the tomb,\r\nwhere the larvæ will find an abundance of food. When the ground is too\r\nhard to be dug, the _Necrophori_ push the carcase further, till they\r\nfind permeable soil. A mole has been run through with a stick, or else\r\ntied by a string, to see how the _Necrophori_ would get over the\r\ndifficulty. They scooped out the soil underneath the stick, and cut\r\nthrough the string, and the mole was buried in spite of the obstacles.\r\nFig. 460 represents a troop of _Necrophori_ burying a small rat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 451.--Dorcus Titan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 452.--Syndesus cornutus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 453.--Chiasognathus Grantii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 454.--Hister rugosus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 455.--Silpha quadripunctata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 456.--Silpha thoracica.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 457.--Necrodes littoralis (male).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 458.--Necrodes littoralis (female).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 459.--Necrodes lacrymosa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 460.--Burying Beetles (_Necrophorus vespillo_)\r\ninterring the body of a rat.]\r\n\r\nThe _Necrophorus vespillo_ (Fig. 461) is variegated with yellow and\r\nblack; the _Necrophorus Germanicus_ (Fig. 462) is larger, quite black,\r\nand rarer. All these insects exhale a disagreeable musky smell. Their\r\nbodies are often covered with parasites, which are carried along by\r\nthem by hooking on to their hairs, and which make use of the\r\n_Necrophorus_ as a vehicle in which they get their food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 461.--Necrophorus vespillo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 462.--Necrophorus Germanicus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 463.--Staphylinus (Ocypus) olens, imago, pupa, and\r\nlarva.]\r\n\r\nThe _Staphylinidæ_ live in the carcases of animals, on manure, in\r\ndetritus, and attack living insects. They are, for the most part, of\r\nsmall size, and are distinguished by their elytra, which are short,\r\nand resemble a waistcoat or a jacket; but their wings are fully\r\ndeveloped. The large species have strong mandibles. When irritated,\r\nthe _Staphylini_ disgorge an acrid black liquid; and by the abdomen\r\nthey emit a volatile fluid having a musky odour.\r\n\r\nWe see frequently on roads the _Staphylinus olens_ (Figs. 463 and\r\n464), which, when it finds itself attacked, raises its abdomen, and\r\nthrusts out two little whitish bladders, which pour out a volatile\r\nliquid. Its larva lives under stones, and its habits are the same as\r\nthose of the adult insect. It is very carnivorous, and very active,\r\nand often attacks those of its own kind. The _Staphylinus hirtus_\r\n(Fig. 466) resembles at a distance a humble-bee, on account of its\r\nlong yellow hairs. The _Staphylinus maxillosus_ (Fig. 465) has black\r\nand white hairs. The genera _Pselaphus_ and _Claviger_, akin to the\r\nabove, contain little insects which live as parasites in the nests of\r\nants. The _Pselaphus Heisii_ (Fig. 467), less than a line long, lives\r\non the _débris_ of reeds, on the borders of marshes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 464.--Staphylinus (Ocypus) olens.]\r\n\r\nThe _Claviger foveolatus_ (Fig. 468) is met with in the nest of a\r\nlittle yellow ant, which takes as much care of it as of its own\r\nprogeny, because the _Claviger_ secretes a liquid very much\r\nappreciated by ants, who are continually occupied in licking its back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 465.--Staphylinus maxillosus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 466.--Staphylinus hirtus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 467.--Pselaphus Heisii (magnified).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 468.--Claviger foveolatus (magnified).]\r\n\r\nThe _Dermestidæ_ attack by preference the tendons and the skins of\r\ncarcases. A few of the insects of this family are the plague of our\r\ncollections and the furriers. They devour a quantity of dry\r\nsubstances--skins, feathers, catgut, hair, objects made of\r\ntortoise-shell, the dried bodies of insects, &c. Some other\r\n_Dermestidæ_ feed on animal matter still fresh: such is the Bacon\r\nBeetle, _Dermestes lardarius_ (Fig. 469), which is to be met with in\r\nsome dirty pork-shops. It is black, with the base of its elytra tawny\r\nand marked with three black spots. The larvæ are covered with a\r\nrussety hair; they eat bacon, skins, and also attack each other. The\r\nperfect insect does no damage. Like all the _Dermestidæ_, it\r\ncounterfeits death when handled. The _Dermestes vulpinus_, of a tawny\r\ngrey, injures furs; and the Hudson's Bay Company, whose storehouses in\r\nLondon were infested by this insect, offered a reward of £20,000 for a\r\nmeans of destroying this insect. The furriers have also cause to dread\r\nthe _Attagenus pellio_ (Fig. 470), whose larva, covered with yellowish\r\nhairs, has at its extremity a sort of broom, which assists it in\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 469.--Bacon Beetle (_Dermestes lardarius_),\r\nmagnified and natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 470.--Attagenus pellio, magnified and natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe _Anthrenus museorum_, the fifteenth of an inch in length, black,\r\nwith three grey bands, drives collectors to despair, for its larva\r\ndestroys their collections. It is covered with grey and brownish\r\nhairs, which it bristles up the moment it is touched. The perfect\r\ninsect feeds on flowers, and counterfeits death when seized. All\r\npossible means have been tried for getting rid of the _Anthrenus_ by\r\nplacing in the collection camphor, benzine, tobacco, sulphur, &c., but\r\nbenzine very soon destroys them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 471.--Hydrophilus piceus.]\r\n\r\nThe _Hydrophili_, very different to the group which we shall presently\r\nconsider, are herbivorous, and are to be found on the leaves of\r\naquatic plants. The _Hydrophilus piceus_ (Fig. 471), which attains to\r\nan inch in length, is common in our fresh waters. It must not be\r\nseized without taking precautions, as its breast is provided with a\r\nstrong point, which pierces the skin. It draws in air by thrusting its\r\nantennæ out of the water, and placing them against its body, the\r\nbubbles of the air, which get involved in a sort of furrow, slip under\r\nthe body, and fix themselves to the hair, in such a manner that the\r\nanimal seems to be clothed in pearls. It is thus the air reaches the\r\nspiracles. The female of the _Hydrophilus_ is sometimes seen clinging\r\nto aquatic plants, head downwards, forming her cocoon, terminated by a\r\nlong pedicle, in which she places her eggs, by means of the two\r\nbristles situated at the extremity of the abdomen (Fig. 472). After\r\nhaving drawn this after her for some time, she leaves it to itself in\r\ncalm water. At the end of a fortnight there come out from it little\r\nbrown larvæ, very active, which ascend the water plants. These larvæ\r\nare at the same time herbivorous and carnivorous. They live on plants\r\nand small molluscs, which they seize from underneath, and whose shell\r\nthey break by pressing them against their back, to extract from it the\r\nanimal. If attacked, they emit a black liquid, which discolours the\r\nwater, and enables them to escape. At the end of two months the larva\r\ncomes out of the water, and burrows into the ground to undergo its\r\nmetamorphosis into a pupa (Fig. 473), which becomes a perfect insect a\r\nmonth afterwards. The latter gets its colour little by little, and\r\ncomes out of the ground at the end of twelve days. According to M.\r\nDumeril, the intestine of the larva grows gradually longer and longer,\r\nand its diet becomes that of herbs, the adult preferring vegetable\r\nfood to animal matter. It is at the end of summer that the\r\n_Hydrophilus piceus_ becomes perfect, and it passes the winter in a\r\nstate of torpor at the bottom of the water. The females lay in the\r\nmonth of April. A small species, _Hydrous caraboides_, is commoner\r\nthan the large one; its body is more rounded behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 472.--Bristles at the extremity of the abdomen of\r\nthe Hydrophilus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 473.--Pupa of the Hydrophilus.]\r\n\r\nWe are now going to consider a series of aquatic and carnivorous\r\ninsects; the _Dytisci_, Water Beetles, the _Cybisters_, and the\r\n_Gyrinidæ_, or Whirligig Beetles. These are perfect corsairs, whose\r\nrapacity even exceeds that of many of the land Coleoptera. Not\r\ncontented with devouring one another, when pressed by hunger, with\r\nattacking especially the larvæ of all aquatic insects, such as the\r\n_Libellulæ_ and _Ephemeræ_, they feed also on molluscs, on tadpoles,\r\nand on small fish. It is easy to rear them in captivity. If confined\r\nin a small aquarium, their habits would be much more amusing than a\r\nfew golden fish, which one meets with everywhere, and which are only\r\ngood enough to amuse European _Schaabahams_. Care must be taken to\r\ncover the aquarium at the top with gauze, to prevent the perfect\r\ninsects from escaping. This tribe is not very numerous nor varied in\r\nits forms. An oval body, legs curved and widened into oars, provided\r\nwith hairs, distinguish the insects which compose it. They imbibe air\r\nat the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 474.--Dytiscus marginalis, male and female, and\r\nfront leg of male magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe most carnivorous of this group are the _Dytisci_ and the\r\n_Cybisters_. They may be called the sharks of the insect world.\r\nNothing which lives in the water is safe against the voracity of the\r\n_Dytiscus_. They attack small molluscs, young fish, tadpoles, larvæ of\r\ninsects, and suck greedily the bits of raw meat which are thrown to\r\nthem. They may be kept in an aquarium for many years by feeding them\r\non animal matter. Their oval-shaped body, with its sharp sides,\r\npermits them to cut through the water with great ease--the hind legs\r\nserving as oars. They are to be found in stagnant waters during the\r\ngreatest part of the year, but principally in autumn. During the\r\nwinter they bury themselves in the mud and under moss. The females lay\r\ntheir eggs in the water. The larvæ are long, swelling out at the\r\nmiddle, furnished with hairs, and grow rapidly. To undergo their\r\nmetamorphosis into pupæ they bury themselves in the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 475.--Pupa and larva of Dytiscus marginalis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 476.--Dytiscus latissimus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 477.--Cybister Roeselii.]\r\n\r\nThe perfect insects are amphibious, and fly from one pond to another\r\nto satisfy their voracious appetites. The most common species of this\r\ngenus is the _Dytiscus marginalis_ (Fig. 474), of a dark greenish\r\nbrown, yellowish on the sides. The elytra of the male are smooth;\r\nthose of the female are fluted. The front leg of the male is provided\r\nwith suckers. The larva is brown; the pupa of a dirty white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 478.--Acilius sulcatus (male).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 479.--Acilius sulcatus (female).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 480.--Acilius fasciatus (male).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 481.--Acilius fasciatus (female).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 482.--Noterus crassicornis.]\r\n\r\nThe _Dytiscus marginalis_ sometimes attacks _Hydrophilus piceus_. It\r\npierces it between the head and the thorax, that is, in the weak point\r\nof the cuirass, and devours it, in spite of its being the stronger.\r\nThe largest of the _Dytisci_, the _Dytiscus latissimus_ (Fig. 476), is\r\nalmost confined to the north of Europe. The _Cybisters_ abound\r\nespecially in warm countries. The _Cybister Roeselii_ (Fig. 477), a\r\nEuropean species, has the reputation of having been taken in England.\r\nThis group contains also a great number of insects more or less\r\nresembling the preceding in their conformation and habits. We will\r\nconfine ourselves to representing a few by figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 483.--Colymbetes cinereus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 484.--Colymbetes notatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 485.--Colymbetes striatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 486.--Haliplus fulvus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 487.--Hydroporus griseo-striatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 488.--Hydroporus confluens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 489.--Suphis cimicoides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 490.--Laccophilus variegatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 491.--Laccophilus minutus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 492.--Hydaticus grammicus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 493.--Pelobius Hermanni.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 494.--Gyrinus natator.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 495.--Larva of Gyrinus natator.]\r\n\r\nThe _Gyrinidæ_, which come very near to the _Dytiscidæ_, like water\r\nwhich is clear and a little agitated. They are small black insects,\r\nliving in troops, and which swim with rapidity, describing incessantly\r\ncapricious circles, which has gained for them the name of \"Whirligigs.\"\r\nThey are remarkable for the disposition of their eyes, which are double;\r\nso that the _Gyrinidæ_ seem to have four eyes. The lower ones look into\r\nthe water and watch for the prey or the fish that advances as an enemy;\r\nwhilst the upper eyes look upwards towards the air, and warn the insect\r\nof the approach of enemies from above. To escape from fish, the\r\n_Gyrinus_ jumps out of the water, and also makes use of its wings; to\r\nescape from birds it dives rapidly. This activity, and this double\r\nsight, make the capture of the _Gyrini_ a task of great difficulty. They\r\nmust be caught with a net. At the moment of being seized they emit a\r\nmilky and foetid liquid.\r\n\r\nThe females lay their eggs end to end, on the leaves of aquatic\r\nplants. The larvæ are long and narrow, and of a dirty white. They come\r\nout of the water at the end of the summer, and form for themselves a\r\ncocoon on the plants bordering the banks. After a month, the perfect\r\ninsect is hatched, and plunges into the water. The _Gyrinus striatus_\r\n(Fig. 496) is found in the waters of southern Europe.\r\n\r\nAll these species are of small size, and do not exceed a fifth of an\r\ninch in length; but in the tropics we find _Gyrini_ two-thirds of an\r\ninch long. One of these species, _distinctus_, exists in the little\r\nlake of Solazies, in Réunion Island, noted for its mineral waters. The\r\nvisitors amuse themselves by fishing for this insect with a line\r\nbaited with a bit of red cloth, which it attacks. It is found also in\r\na mineral spring in Algeria. The _Epinecti_ (Fig. 498) are large\r\n_Gyrinidæ_ from Brazil, with very long front legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 496.--Gyrinus striatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 497.--Gyrinus distinctus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 498.--Epinectus sulcatus.]\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous land insects _par excellence_--those which are most\r\nformidable, on account of their ravages and voracity--are the\r\n_Carabidæ_. This family, one of the most numerous of the Order\r\nColeoptera, consists of insects with long legs, and armed with\r\npowerful mandibles, suited for tearing their victims to pieces. They\r\nare the lions and the tigers of the Coleoptera, whilst the\r\n_Necrophori_ and the _Silphæ_ play the part of hyænas and jackals. The\r\neyes of the _Carabidæ_ are very prominent, which allows them to see\r\ntheir prey at a great distance. They take refuge under stones and\r\nunder the bark of trees; but in fine weather they are also to be seen\r\nrunning along roads. Ardent and audacious, it is by no means rare to\r\nsee them attacking species much bigger than themselves. The activity\r\nwhich distinguishes these insects is found also in their larvæ, which\r\npursue living prey, instead of remaining shrouded in the midst of\r\ntheir food, like the larvæ of the _Scarabæidæ_.\r\n\r\nThese carnivorous insects are very numerous--a fortunate circumstance,\r\nconsidering the immense quantity of small noxious creatures,\r\ncaterpillars, weevils, and an infinity of other parasites, the pests\r\nof agriculture, which they destroy. The popular prejudice, then, is to\r\nbe regretted, which leads ignorant farmers to exterminate them. They\r\nought, on the contrary, to be introduced into market gardens, as toads\r\nare, and as cats are into granaries. \"The _Carabidæ_,\" says M.\r\nMichelet, \"immense tribes of warriors, armed to the teeth, which,\r\nunder their heavy cuirasses, have a wonderful activity, are perfect\r\nrural constabulary, day and night, without holidays or repose,\r\nprotecting our fields. They never touch the smallest thing. They are\r\noccupied entirely in arresting thieves, and they desire no salary but\r\nthe body of the thief himself.\" But ignorance destroys these useful\r\nhunters. Children, seduced by the richness of the elytra of the\r\n_Carabi_, amuse themselves in catching these vigilant protectors of\r\nour farms, without knowing the bad effect of what they are doing.\r\nFortunately, education is spreading little by little in the country;\r\nthe farmers begin to be awakened to their true interests, and to know\r\nhow to distinguish the useful animals which it behoves them to\r\npreserve in their fields for the safeguard of their crops. In some\r\nplaces in France they have already made attempts to introduce the\r\n_Carabidæ_ and the _Cicindelidæ_ into gardens, and they have found\r\nthem succeed very well.\r\n\r\nThe true _Carabi_ are to be known by their oval convex body, their\r\nlong antennæ, and elegantly-carved thorax. They are, in general, of\r\nmore massive forms than the _Cicindelidæ_, which compose a kindred\r\nfamily. The latter form, in some sort, the vanguard and the light\r\ntroops; the others, the heavy battalions. The _Carabi_ coming out in\r\ngeneral at night, or at least at twilight, and keeping themselves\r\nhidden under stones during the day, it is not easy to observe their\r\nmanoeuvres.\r\n\r\nThe _Carabus auratus_ (Fig. 499), which abounds in fields and gardens\r\non the Continent, may be considered as the type of this genus. It has\r\nelytra of a beautiful green, with three ribs, and the legs yellowish.\r\nWhen it is touched it disgorges a black and acrid saliva, and ejects\r\nfrom the abdomen a corrosive liquid of a disagreeable odour. It lives\r\non the larvæ of other insects. It has been seen to attack even large\r\ninsects, such as the cockchafer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 499.--Carabus auratus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 500.--Carabus violaceus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 501.--Carabus canaliculatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 502.--Carabus Adonis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 503.--Carabus nodulosus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 504.--Larva of Carabus auronitens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 505.--Calosoma auropunctata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 506, 507.--Pupa and larva of Calosoma auropunctata.]\r\n\r\nIn England and the environs of Paris, _Carabus violaceus_ (Fig. 500),\r\nwhose dress, of a sombre colour, is surrounded by shades of red and\r\nviolet, is met with. In the Pyrenees many _Carabi_ with metallic\r\nreflections are found, whose beautiful colours are the delight of\r\ncollectors; the _Carabus splendens_, the _Carabus rutilans_, &c. But the\r\nmost beautiful insects of this tribe come from Siberia and the north of\r\nChina. Let us mention, for example, the _Carabus smaragdinus_, of a\r\nbeautiful grass-green; the _Carabus Vietinghovii_, of a beautiful blue\r\nblack, bordered with azure, with a golden band, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 508.--Calosoma sycophanta pursuing a Bombardier\r\nBeetle (_Brachinus explodens_).]\r\n\r\nThe _Carabus Adonis_ (Fig. 502) is not rare in Alsace, and is found on\r\nthe banks of streams.\r\n\r\nThe long flat larvæ of the _Carabi_ live in the trunks of trees, among\r\nleaves, under moss, &c. They are active, and live on other insects.\r\nFig. 504 represents the larva of the _Carabus auronitens_.\r\n\r\nAnother genus of the same family is _Calosoma_. They have wings under\r\ntheir elytra--the true _Carabi_ have not--which they use in passing\r\nfrom one tree to another.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June is to be found on oak trees the beautiful\r\n_Calosoma sycophanta_ (Fig. 508), the occasional occurrence of which\r\nin England is unquestionable; it is, however, presumed that the\r\nspecimens have reached our shores from the Continent by flight,\r\nfavoured by strong easterly winds. This insect is of a beautiful\r\nviolet blue, having the antennæ and the legs black, and the elytra of\r\na splendid golden green, with longitudinal streaks. According to\r\nRéaumur, the larva of the _Calosoma_ often chooses a home in the nest\r\nof the Procession-Moth Caterpillar (_Bombyx processionea_), on oak\r\ntrees, and it very soon rids the tree which is infested by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 509.--Procrustes coriaceus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 510.--Procerus gigas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 511.--Omophron libatum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 512.--Nebria arenaria.]\r\n\r\nThe _Calosoma auropunctata_ is found in the south of France. Its larva\r\n(Fig. 507) devours snails, and establishes itself in their shells.\r\nThese larvæ have been known to fill themselves so full of food as to\r\nbecome double their natural size, in which state they are sometimes\r\ndevoured by those of their own species. A smaller kind, the _Calosoma\r\ninquisitor_, is very frequently to be met with in woods. Fig. 508\r\npresents _Calosoma sycophanta_ pursuing a Bombardier (_Brachinus\r\nexplodens_), which squirts out a vapour of pungent odour.\r\n\r\nIn the countries of the south-east of Europe, and in Asia Minor, one\r\nfinds enormous _Carabidæ_, the _Procrustes_ and the _Proceri_, which\r\nattain nearly two inches in length, and whose integuments resemble\r\nvery rough shagreen. One species alone is met with in France, the\r\n_Procrustes coriaceus_ (Fig. 509). In Austria is found the _Procerus\r\ngigas_ (Fig. 510).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Omophron_ (Fig. 511) contains small, almost globular\r\n_Carabidæ_ of a pale yellow, with green lines, and which live in the\r\nsand bordering rivers. The _Nebrias_ in general prefer mountainous\r\ncountries. The largest species, the _Nebria arenaria_ (Fig. 512), is\r\nfound all along the coast of the Mediterranean, and even on the\r\nwestern shores of France. But its colours grow paler as it advances\r\nnorthward on the African coast. It is of a bright yellow with black\r\nlines. The _Nebrias_ hide themselves either under masses of seaweed\r\ncast up by the waves, or under the stumps of trees cast ashore by the\r\nsea. When they are deprived of their place of shelter, they run away\r\nwith such rapidity that it is very difficult to catch them. In Senegal\r\nis found the genus _Tefflus_ (Fig. 513), great black _Carabidæ_ with\r\nfluted elytra.\r\n\r\nOther kindred genera are--_Damaster_ (Fig. 514), remarkable for\r\nelongated pointed elytra; _Anthia_ (Fig. 515), which is met with in\r\nsand in Africa and in India, and whose head is armed in a formidable\r\nmanner; and _Campylocnemis_, of which _Schroeteri_ (Fig. 516), an\r\nAustralian insect, of a bright black, attains to more than an inch and\r\nthree quarters in length, and whose short serrated legs enable it to\r\nhollow out the ground. There is found on the coasts of the south of\r\nFrance a representative of this group in the _Scarites lævigatus_\r\n(Fig. 517), which conceals itself in a hollow, like the cricket, and\r\ndevours everything which comes within its reach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 513.--Tefflus Megerlei.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 514.--Damaster blaptoides.]\r\n\r\nThe innumerable tribe of _Harpalidæ_ contains carnivorous beetles of\r\nvery small size, sometimes of a bronze-green, sometimes black, either\r\ndull or shining, and which render great service to our gardens. Hidden\r\nunder stones, in dry leaves, at the foot of trees, they attack a\r\nnumber of small insects, caterpillars, millepedes, &c., and thus\r\nexterminate a quantity of vermin. The _Harpalus æneus_ (Fig. 518),\r\nwhich is seen shining in the midst of the paving stones like a little\r\nbronze plate, is found everywhere. The _Galeritas_ (Figs. 519 and 520)\r\nare distinguished by their antennæ, which are thick at the base; they\r\nexhale a very strong odour: nearly all are peculiar to America. One of\r\nthe most curious insects of this tribe is the _Mormolyce phyllodes_ of\r\nJava (Fig. 521) whose elytra project in such a manner as to give it\r\nthe appearance of a leaf. It lives under bark. The larva and the pupa\r\n(Fig. 522) resemble those of other genera of which we have been\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 515.--Anthia thoracica.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 516.--Campylocnemis Schroeteri.]\r\n\r\nThe next great family of the tribe of carnivorous beetles is composed\r\nof the _Cicindelidæ_--slender insects, with large prominent heads,\r\nvery long legs, and which are very active in their movements. The\r\n_Cicindelidæ_ like sandy plains. When the sun shines they fly in a\r\nzig-zag manner, but their flight is not continued for long together.\r\nIn dull weather they are to be seen running on the turf or hiding\r\nthemselves in holes, and are met with on the sea-shore, where they\r\nare seen sometimes to pop up by hundreds. They live on flies and\r\nlittle shrimps, which abound on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 517.--Scarites lævigatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 518.--Harpalus æneus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 519.--Larva of Galerita Lecontei.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 520. Galerita Lecontei.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 521.--Mormolyce phyllodes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 522.--Larva and pupa of Mormolyce phyllodes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 523.--Tiger Beetle (_Cicindela campestris_).]\r\n\r\nThe _Cicindela campestris_ (Fig. 523), or Tiger Beetle, is of a\r\nbeautiful green, spotted with white; the abdomen is of a bronze red.\r\nIn this country it is the commonest of the genus. The _Cicindela\r\nhybrida_, of a dull green, relieved by light bands, inhabits sandy\r\nwoods. The _Cicindela maritima_ differs from the preceding. The\r\n_Cicindela sylvatica_, which flies very well, is not easy to catch,\r\nand is to be often met with in the warm glades of the forest of\r\nFontainebleau and at Montmorency; it is not unfrequent here. Its\r\ncolour is brown, spotted with white; it diffuses a strong smell of the\r\nrose, to which succeeds, on being seized, the acrid odour of the\r\nsecretion which it disgorges. We here represent the _Cicindela\r\nDumoulinii_ (Fig. 524), the _Cicindela rugosa_ (Fig. 525), the\r\n_Cicindela scalaris_ (Fig. 526), the _Cicindela heros_ (Fig. 527), the\r\n_Cicindela quadrilineata_ (Fig. 528), and the _Cicindela capensis_\r\n(Fig. 529).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 524.--Cicindela Dumoulinii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 525.--Cicindela rugosa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 526.--Cicindela scalaris.]\r\n\r\nThe ferocity of these insects is remarkable. They quickly tear off the\r\nwings and legs of their victim, and suck out the contents of its\r\nabdomen. Often, when they are disturbed in this agreeable occupation,\r\nnot wishing to leave it, they fly away with their prey; their flight,\r\nhowever, is not sufficiently powerful to allow of their carrying to\r\nany great distance such a heavy burden. When a _Cicindela_ is seized\r\nbetween the fingers, it moves about its mandibles and endeavours to\r\npinch, but its bite is inoffensive and not very painful. They are\r\nprodigiously active in running. Armed with jaws which are powerful\r\nenough to overcome their victims and to seize them at once, they can\r\ndispense with stratagem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 527.--Cicindela heros.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 528.--Cicindela quadrilineata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 529.--Cicindela capensis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 530.--Larva of Cicindela campestris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 531.--Ambush of larva of Cicindela campestris.]\r\n\r\nTheir larvæ (Fig. 530) are soft, and have short legs. To satisfy their\r\nvoracity they are obliged to lie in ambush in holes. They are\r\ntwo-thirds of an inch long; their head is horny and in the form of a\r\ntrapezium. The first segment is also horny, and of a metallic green.\r\nThe eighth has a pair of tubercles with hooks, of which the larva\r\nmakes use in ascending and descending its vertical hole, like a sweep\r\nin a chimney. This hole (Fig. 531) is a foot or more deep. To dig it,\r\nthe larva employs its mandibles and its legs in the following manner:\r\nit twists itself round, loads with earth the flat surface which covers\r\nits head, climbs along the chimney by twisting itself into the form\r\nof the letter Z, and thus transports its load, as a bricklayer's\r\nlabourer carries a hod of mortar up a ladder. Arrived at the mouth of\r\nthe hole, it throws to a distance the rubbish with which its head is\r\nloaded; or, if too heavy, it simply deposits it, pushing it away as\r\nfar as possible. It is difficult to watch their proceedings, for they\r\nare very mistrustful, and retire immediately into their hole when\r\nalarmed. They remain in ambush at the entrances of these subterranean\r\npassages, which they hermetically seal with their head and thorax. It\r\nis a species of pitfall which sets itself in motion the moment\r\nanything endeavours to pass it. The unfortunate who ventures is\r\nprecipitated into the well, and the _Cicindela_ forthwith devours it.\r\nThese habits remind one of those of the ant-lion. When the time\r\narrives for the metamorphosis, the larva of the _Cicindela_ enlarges\r\nthe bottom of its hole, and stops up the entrance with earth before\r\nchanging. The pupa (Figs. 532, 533) is of a pale glossy yellow,\r\ncovered with small spines. The metamorphosis takes place between\r\nAugust and October; the perfect insect emerges in spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 532.--Pupa of a Cicindela (Upper-side).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 533.--Pupa of a Cicindela (Under-side).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 534.--Tetracha Klugii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 535.--Tetracha oxychiloides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 536.--Tetracha bifasciata.]\r\n\r\nNearly akin to the _Cicindelas_ are the _Tetrachas_ (Figs. 534, 535,\r\n536), from Africa and tropical America; the _Manticoras_ (Fig. 537),\r\nwhich are distinguished by their robust and thick-set appearance;\r\nthe _Pogonostomas_ (Fig. 538), which live in Madagascar; the\r\n_Ctenostomas_, peculiar to America (Fig. 539), remarkable for the\r\nlength of their pendent and bristly palpi; the _Omus_, of California;\r\nthe _Therates_ (Fig. 540), insects of the East Indian Islands, &c.\r\n\r\nThe tribe of _Tenebrionidæ_, called formerly _Melasomas_, because they\r\nare nearly all black, resembles in some points the _Carabici_. They\r\nseek after dark places, and avoid the light, and are found on the\r\nground under stones; their movements are slow, and they walk with\r\ndifficulty. The best-known insect of this group is the _Blaps_, of\r\nrepulsive smell, inhabiting dark damp places, such as cellars, and\r\nonly coming out of its retreat during the night. The elytra are\r\njoined together, and they have no wings. The vulgar regard them as an\r\nomen of ill-luck. Fig. 541 represents the _Blaps obtusa_. According to\r\nthe report of a traveller, the women in Egypt eat the _Blaps sulcata_\r\ncooked with butter, to make them fat. They are employed also against\r\nthe ear-ache, the bite of scorpions, &c.\r\n\r\nAnother genus of the same family is the _Tenebrio_ (Fig. 542), of a\r\nblackish-brown, with the elytra striated, and of half an inch in\r\nlength. The larvæ, the well-known meal-worms, live in flour; they are\r\ncylindrical, and of a light tawny colour (Fig. 542). The insect which\r\nis considered as a type of the tribe of the _Pimelides_ is the\r\n_Pimelia bipunctata_, which is common in the south of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 537--Manticora tuberculata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 538.--Pogonostoma gracilis.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the tribe of blistering beetles, of which the best\r\nknown is the Cantharides (_Cantharis_ or _Lytta_). These insects are\r\ngenerally of soft consistency, and their elytra very flexible. A few\r\nremain constantly on trees. All are very brisk and active. When\r\nswallowed they are a dangerous poison, but are used in medicine for\r\nmaking blisters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 539.--Ctenostoma rugosa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 540.--Therates labiata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 541.--Blaps obtusa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 542.--Tenebrio molitor (larva and imago).]\r\n\r\nThe Cantharides of commerce (_Cantharis_ [_Lytta_] _vesicatoria_) are\r\nof a beautiful green, attain to a size of four-fifths of an inch, and\r\nare found on ash-trees, lilacs, and other shrubs. Commerce for a long\r\ntime brought them from Spain, and some still come from that country;\r\nhence the common name of _Spanish fly_. As they live in great numbers\r\ntogether, collecting them is easier and less expensive than would be\r\nthat of other species of the same family which are not gregarious, but\r\nwhich have the same medicinal properties. The presence of the\r\nCantharides is manifested by the strong penetrating odour which they\r\ndiffuse to some distance. When, by aid of this smell, they are\r\ndiscovered, generally settled on an ash, they are collected in the\r\nfollowing manner:--Very early in the morning a cloth of light tissue\r\nis stretched out at the foot of the tree, and the branches are shaken,\r\nwhich causes the insects to fall (PLATE XII.). These, numbed by the\r\ncold of the night, do not try to escape. When there is a sufficient\r\nquantity, the four corners are drawn up and the whole plunged into a\r\ntub of vinegar diluted with water. This immersion causes the death of\r\nthe insects. They then carry them to a loft, or under a very airy\r\nshed. To dry them they spread them out on hurdles covered with linen\r\nor paper, and from time to time, to facilitate the operation, they are\r\nmoved about, either with a stick or with the hand, which is more\r\nconvenient; but it is then necessary to take the precaution of putting\r\non gloves, for, if touched with the naked hand, they would cause more\r\nor less serious blisters. The same precaution must be observed in\r\ngathering them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Cantharides are quite dry, they put them into wooden boxes or\r\nvessels of glass or earthenware hermetically sealed, and preserve them\r\nin a place protected from damp. With these precautions, they may be\r\nkept for a long while without losing any of their caustic properties.\r\nDumeril made blisters of Cantharides which had been twenty-four years\r\nin store, and which had lost none of their energy. When dry, they are\r\nso light that a kilogramme contains nearly 13,000 insects. Aretius, a\r\nphysician who flourished at Rome in the first century of our era,\r\nseems to have been the first to employ Cantharides, reduced to powder,\r\nas a means of vesication. Hippocrates administered them internally in\r\ncases of dropsy, apoplexy, and jaundice. But it is pretty nearly\r\nestablished that the Cantharides of the ancients were not the same\r\nspecies used at the present day; they were, probably, a kindred\r\nspecies, the _Mylabris chicorii_. A blistering principle has been\r\nextracted from these insects, called _Cantharadine_. This organic\r\nproduct presents itself under the form of little shining flakes,\r\nwithout colour, soluble in ether or oil. One atom of this matter\r\napplied to the skin, and particularly to the lower lip, makes the\r\nepidermis rise instantaneously, and produces a small blister filled\r\nwith a watery liquid. In spite of the corrosive principle which the\r\n_Cantharis_ contains, it is attacked, like other dried insects, by the\r\n_Dermestes_ and the _Anthrenus_, which feast on them without suffering\r\nthe smallest inconvenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XII. Gathering Cantharides.]\r\n\r\nThe _Stylopidæ_, for which Kirby,[122] in 1811, instituted a distinct\r\nOrder, which he called _Strepsiptera_, in allusion to the contortion\r\nof the elytra, and to which Latreille[123] subsequently applied the\r\nname of _Rhipiptera_, are, perhaps, the most anomalous of all insects.\r\nGreat diversity of opinion has existed respecting their affinities;\r\nbut modern systematists, with but few exceptions, concur in referring\r\nthem to the Order _Coleoptera_, and locating them in proximity to\r\n_Meloë_. In the larva state, all the known species of the family\r\ninhabit the bodies of hymenopterous insects of the genera _Andrena_,\r\n_Polistes_, &c., in this particular resembling the dipterous genus\r\n_Conops_, which inhabits the body of humble bees,[124] and apparently\r\nin no way inconveniencing their victims; a fact which has been\r\naccounted for on the supposition that their existence in the larva\r\nstate is but short, and that their attacks being directed against the\r\nabdomen, and not the thorax, the seat of life in insects, their\r\npresence does not affect the activity of the victim. The larva has a\r\nsoft fusiform body, surmounted by a somewhat globose head. While\r\nfeeding, the head is towards the base of the abdomen; but on changing\r\nto a pupa, this position is reversed, and the head--at first of light\r\nbrown, but which after a short time becomes black--thrust out between\r\nthe plates of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n    [122] \"On a new Order of Insects,\" _Linn. Trans._, vol. xi.\r\n\r\n    [123] In Cuvier, \"Le Règne Animal,\" ed. i., tome iii., p. 584.\r\n\r\n    [124] See p. 69.\r\n\r\nThe imagos, which are of small size, namely, about the eighth of an\r\ninch long, are found during May and June. They have four wings, but\r\nthe anterior pair, of hard texture, somewhat resembling elytra, but\r\nhardly answering to them in structure, are very poorly developed, and\r\ncurled round the front pair of legs, hence the name bestowed, by\r\nKirby, from [Greek: strepssis], a twisting, and [Greek: pteron], a\r\nwing; the posterior wings are fully developed, and fold up like a fan,\r\nwhence the Order received the name of _Rhipiptera_ from Latreille. The\r\neyes, the facettes of which are few in number, are placed on a\r\nfootstalk, whence the name of the genus _Stylops_. The parts of the\r\nmouth connect the Strepsiptera with the mandibulated insects, although\r\nby some supposed to bear analogy by their functions to those parts in\r\nthe Diptera. The male only is winged; the female is very like an\r\napodal larva, the larva being an active hexapod.\r\n\r\nThe family _Stylopidæ_ is divided into four genera, of which two only,\r\n_Xenos_ and _Stylops_, were described by Kirby in the essay referred\r\nto above. First, _Xenos_, from [Greek: xenos], a guest, the most\r\nprolific in species, of which _Xenos Rossii_, sometimes called\r\n_vesparum_, may be taken as the type. Secondly, _Elenchus_, of which\r\n_Elenchus Walkeri_ is the type. Thirdly, _Stylops_ (Fig. 543),\r\nparasitical on various species of _Andrenæ_, of which _Stylops\r\nMelittæ_, having a fleshy abdomen and the wings longer than the body,\r\nmay be considered typical: and lastly, _Halictophagus_, of which only\r\none species, infesting _Halictus æratus_[125] named _Halictophagus\r\nCurtisii_, is known to exist, and which makes its appearance in the\r\nmonth of August.\r\n\r\n    [125] _Halictus_ and _Andrena_ are two genera of Bees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 543.--Stylops (magnified).]\r\n\r\nThese singular insects are found in various parts of the\r\nworld--Europe, Australia, and America. They were discovered by\r\nProfessor Peck almost simultaneously with Mr. Kirby's discovery in\r\nthis country, and to whom he sent specimens of a species which has\r\nreceived the name of _Xenos Peckii_ lately, in New Zealand and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nSiebold, in 1843, having obtained some eggs, was able to observe the\r\nlarvæ, and he soon discovered that the females of Stylops, one of the\r\nStrepsiptera, were blind, had no legs, and always retained the\r\nappearance of larvæ, and that they never quitted the bodies of those\r\ninsects, in which they pass a parasitic existence. George Newport paid\r\ngreat attention to the history of these curious insects, and when he\r\nwrote his article, \"Insecta,\" in the \"Cyclopædia of Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology,\" four distinct genera of these minute parasites had\r\nalready been discovered. One of the largest species (_Stylops\r\nSpencii_) is scarcely more than two lines in length, while the\r\nsmallest species yet known is not more than two-thirds of a line, or\r\nscarcely a line in breadth with its wings expanded. They undergo\r\nmetamorphosis; and the males, when they have become perfect insects,\r\nfly and roam about, but the females are condemned to a perfectly quiet\r\nlife. The head and the thoracic segments of the bodies of these last\r\nare united completely, but the abdomen, which is very large, always\r\nremains soft, so that the whole of the body only appears to be formed\r\nof two portions. They are ovo-viviparous insects, and the young larvæ\r\nescape as such from the body of the mother. They are active creatures,\r\nand, being furnished with long legs, crawl over the hairs and skin of\r\nthe hymenopterous insect they are parasitic upon. They behave like the\r\nlarvæ of Meloë and Sitaris, whose peculiar methods of life have been\r\nnoticed in our description of the Coleoptera. Clinging on to a wasp or\r\na bee, they are carried off, and finally arrive in the nest or hive,\r\nas the case may be, and there they attack the larvæ. When once fixed\r\nupon the hymenopterous larvæ, they undergo a change of skin, and their\r\nshape then becomes totally different, and their legs are atrophied.\r\nBut these parasites being exceedingly small, do not kill the larvæ;\r\nthey suck their juices, after the manner of the Ichneumons, and do not\r\ninterfere with the metamorphoses of the insects upon which they are\r\nparasitic. On the right hand, in the accompanying engraving (Fig.\r\n544), there is a larva much magnified, lately born, and climbing upon\r\nthe hair of one of the Hymenoptera, and on the left hand there is a\r\nperfect female insect, very much magnified, with ovo-viviparous larvæ\r\nwithin its abdomen, and between the two figures there is a\r\nrepresentation of a larva of the natural size. It is evident, however,\r\nthat ova may be expelled from the mother before they are hatched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 544.--Female and Larva of Stylops.]\r\n\r\nPackard describes the curious history of the female Stylops, which he\r\nfound parasitic on one of the bees. He caught the bee, and on\r\nexamining it he noticed a pale reddish-brown triangular mark on the\r\nabdomen, and this was the flattened head and thorax of a female\r\nStylops. The creature is included in the body of the bee, and is\r\nnourished by its juices. The head and thorax of the parasite were\r\nnoticed to be soldered into a single flattened mass, the baggy hind\r\nbody being greatly enlarged, like that of the female white ant. On\r\ncarefully drawing out the whole body from the bee the mass was found\r\nto be very extensible, soft, and baggy, and on examining it under a\r\nhigh power of the microscope, multitudes of very minute larvæ were\r\nobserved, and they began to issue out from the body of the parent all\r\nalive, and not as eggs. The male of this _Stylops childreni_ is\r\ntotally unlike its partner, having large hind wings, and being able to\r\nfly, as has already been noticed. It appears, then, that the larvæ are\r\nhatched or crawl out of the body of the mother on to the body of the\r\nbee, and are then transported to its nest; then they enter the body of\r\nthe bee larva, and live upon its fatty matter. The male Stylops is\r\nturned into a pupa within the bee, and so is the female; but after the\r\nsecond metamorphosis the male flies off, leaving his wingless partner\r\nimprisoned for life, and she usually dies immediately after giving\r\nbirth to her myriad offspring (Packard). The female respires by\r\npeculiarly arranged tracheæ, and absorbs nourishment through her skin\r\nas well as by means of an alimentary canal, which ends in a blind sac.\r\nAll the beauties of the female, so far as they are visible to the\r\nmale, consist in the tiny patch which appears just without the body of\r\nthe unfortunate bee, and the ova collect in a space which opens\r\nbetween the united head and body and the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Mylabris_ corresponds most in structure, in appearance, and\r\nin properties, to _Cantharis_, whose place they take in the East, in\r\nChina, and in the south of Europe. They are found in clusters on the\r\nflowers of chicory, thistles, &c. The _Mylabris chicorii_, common\r\nenough in France, especially in the south, is of small size, whilst\r\nthe other species are rather large. It is black, hairy, with a large\r\nyellowish spot at the base of each elytron, and two transverse bands\r\nof the same colour.\r\n\r\nAnother genus of this family is _Meloë_, with very short elytra, and\r\nwithout wings. They walk slowly and with difficulty on low plants, the\r\nfemale dragging along an enormous abdomen filled with eggs. They are\r\ngenerally observed in spring. In Germany they give them the name of\r\n_Maiwurm_ (Mayworm). Their succulence would expose them, without\r\ndoubt, to the voracity of birds and of insect-eating Mammifers if they\r\nhad not the power of exuding at will, in the moment of danger, from\r\nall their articulations, an unctuous humour of a reddish-yellow\r\ncolour, the odour and probably also the caustic properties of which\r\nrepel the aggressor. The females lay their eggs underground, and out\r\nof these come forth larvæ of a strange shape. Swallowed by cattle,\r\nthey cause them to swell and die. It is for this reason that Latreille\r\nhas given it as his opinion that these insects are the _Buprestis_ of\r\nthe ancients, of which the law of Cornelius speaks, \"Lex Cornelia de\r\nsicariis et veneficis.\" But the name of _Buprestis_ was applied by\r\nLinnæus to a genus of which we shall treat farther on, and it has been\r\ngenerally adopted by naturalists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 545.--Sitaris humeralis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 546.--First larva of Sitaris humeralis (magnified).]\r\n\r\nThe commonest among the _Meloës_ is the _Meloë proscarabæus_, which is\r\nto be found in abundance, in the month of April, in the meadows near\r\nthe bridge of Ivry in the environs of Paris. The metamorphoses of the\r\ninsects of this family had remained for a long time surrounded with\r\nan impenetrable veil of mystery, but the researches of Newport in\r\nEngland, and of M. Fabre (of Avignon) in France, has made known in our\r\ndays, phases, extremely curious, under which are accomplished the\r\nmetamorphoses of the _Meloë cicatricosus_, and of the _Sitaris\r\nhumeralis_, a species which belongs to the same family.[126] These\r\nobservations, of which we are about to give a rapid summary, will\r\nprobably help towards unravelling the first states of _Cantharis_.\r\n\r\n    [126] \"Annales des Sciences Naturelles,\" 1857, 4e série, tome\r\n    vii., p. 300.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 547.--Pseudo-nymph of Sitaris humeralis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 548.--Third larva of Sitaris humeralis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 549.--Pupa of Sitaris humeralis.]\r\n\r\nThe _Sitaris humeralis_ (Fig. 545) takes no nourishment when arrived\r\nat the perfect state. When the female has been impregnated, she lays\r\nat the entrance of the nest of a solitary bee from 2,000 to 3,000\r\nsmall whitish eggs, stuck together in shapeless masses. A month\r\nafterwards there come out of these eggs very small larvæ, of a shiny\r\ndark green, hard-skinned, armed with strong jaws, and long legs and\r\nantennæ (Fig. 546). These are the first larvæ. They remain motionless,\r\nand without taking food, till the following spring. At this period are\r\nhatched the male bees, which precede the appearance of the females by\r\na month. As the bees come out of their nests, these larvæ hook\r\nthemselves on to their hairs, and pass them to the females, at the\r\ncoupling period. When the male bees have built the cells, and\r\nfurnished them with honey, the female, as we know, deposits in each an\r\negg. Immediately the larvæ of the _Sitaris_ let themselves fall on\r\nthese eggs, open them, and suck their contents. Then they change their\r\nskin, and the second larva appears. This one gets into the honey, on\r\nwhich it feeds for six weeks. It is blind, whereas the first larva was\r\nprovided with four eyes, no doubt to enable it to see the bees which\r\nwere to serve as its conductors, in like manner as the companions of\r\nUlysses watched the sheep of Polyphemus, so as to escape out of the\r\ncave in which they were retained as prisoners. A few days later, and\r\nthis second larva contracts, and detaches from its body a transparent\r\nskin, which discloses a mass, at first soft, which very soon hardens,\r\nand becomes of a bright tawny colour; it is called the _pseudo-nymph_\r\n(Fig. 547). It goes through the winter in this state. In the spring\r\ncomes forth a third larva (Fig. 548), resembling the second. This one\r\ndoes not eat, and moults after a time. It very soon changes into an\r\nordinary pupa (Fig. 549), of a yellowish-white, from which comes forth\r\nthe adult _Sitaris_, which lives only a few days, to ensure the\r\npropagation of its species, as is observed in the case of the\r\n_Ephemeræ_. The larvæ of the _Sitaris_ had for a long time been\r\nremarked clinging on to the hairs of the _Anthophoras_, but they were\r\nalways taken for _Acari_, and they had been described as such.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 550.--Lampyris noctiluca (male and female).]\r\n\r\nThe _Lampyridæ_ have the elytra weak and soft, like the insects of the\r\npreceding tribe. In their perfect state they frequent flowers. The\r\nlarvæ are carnivorous, attacking other insects or worms. It is to this\r\ngroup that the _Lampyris noctiluca_, or glow-worm, which one sees\r\nshining during summer nights on grass and bushes, belongs. It has the\r\npower of making this natural torch shine or disappear at will.\r\n\r\nThe luminous properties with which these insects are endowed have for\r\ntheir object to reveal their presence to the opposite sex, for the\r\nfemales alone possess these properties. In the same way as sounds or\r\nodours exhaling from some insects attract the one towards the other\r\nsex, so with the _Lampyris_ a phosphorescent light shows the females\r\nto the males. The seat of the phosphorescent substance varies\r\naccording to the species. It exists generally under the three last\r\nrings of the abdomen, and the light is produced by the slow combustion\r\nof a peculiar secretion. It has been stated that it is evolved quickly\r\nwhen the animal contracts its muscles, either spontaneously or under\r\nthe influence of artificial excitement. Some chemical experiments have\r\nbeen made to ascertain the nature or the composition of the humour\r\nwhich produces this strange effect; but up to this moment, they have\r\nonly enabled us to discover that the luminous action is more powerful\r\nin oxygen, and ceases in gases incapable of supporting combustion. In\r\nthe most common species, the _Lampyris noctiluca_, or glow-worm, the\r\nphosphorescence is of a greenish tint: it assumes at certain moments\r\nthe brightness of white-hot coal.\r\n\r\nThe females have no wings, while the males have them, and possess very\r\nwell-developed elytra. The females resemble the larvæ much, only they\r\nhave the head more conspicuous, and the thorax buckler-shaped, like\r\nthe male. The larvæ feed on small molluscs, hiding in the snails'\r\nshells, after having devoured the inhabitant. They also possess the\r\nphosphorescent property in a less degree than the adult females. The\r\nfemale pupa resembles the larva; the pupa of the male, on the\r\ncontrary, has the wings folded back under a thin skin. The perfect\r\ninsect appears towards the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe Glow-worm (_Lampyris noctiluca_, Fig. 550) is of a brownish\r\nyellow. It is common in England. In a kindred species, the _Luciola\r\nItalica_, the two sexes are winged, of a tawny-brown, and equally\r\nphosphorescent. They are met with in great numbers in Italy, and the\r\nlawns are covered with them. Other insects of this family are without\r\nthe faculty of emitting light; as, for example, the genus _Lycus_, of\r\nbrilliant colours, which are met with in Africa and India. One of the\r\nfinest is the _Lycus latissimus_.\r\n\r\n_Drilus_ is another genus, comprising insects of very singular habits.\r\nThe type is the _Drilus flavescens_. The male--a quarter of an inch\r\nlong, black and hairy, with elytra of a testaceous yellow, and with\r\npectinated antennæ--for a long time was alone known. The female--from\r\nten to fifteen times as large, without wings and elytra, of a\r\nyellowish brown--was not discovered till much later, having apparently\r\nnothing in common with the male in shape or colour. The metamorphoses\r\nof these curious insects are now perfectly understood. Mielzinsky, a\r\nPolish naturalist established at Geneva, found the _Drilus_ in the\r\nlarva state in the shell of the _Helix nemoralis_. These larvæ devour\r\nthe snail whose dwelling they occupy, as do the larvæ of the\r\n_Lampyris_. Mielzinsky saw them emerge, but obtained only females,\r\nwhich differed scarcely at all from the larvæ from which they\r\nproceeded. He made a separate genus of them, under the denomination of\r\n_Cochleoctonus_, and called the species _Vorax_. Later, Desmarest\r\nresumed these observations. He provided himself, at the Veterinary\r\nCollege of Alfort, with a number of shells of the _Helix_ filled with\r\nthe same larvæ. He saw come out of them, not only _Cochleoctoni_, but\r\nalso _Drili_, and he watched their coupling. It was then proved, by\r\nthis unanswerable argument, that these two insects, so unlike each\r\nother, belong to the same species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 551.--Jumping organ of the Elater.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 552.--Jumping organ of the Elater, seen sideways.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 553.--Larva of the Elater.]\r\n\r\nThe larva of the _Drilus flavescens_ fixes itself upon the shell of\r\nthe snail by a sort of sucker, like a leech. Little by little it slips\r\nin between the mollusc and its house, and devours it entirely. To\r\nchange into a pupa, it shuts up the entrance to the shell with its old\r\nskin; and when arrived at the perfect state, quits the shell which\r\nserved it as a temporary dwelling. The females of the _Drilus\r\nflavescens_ take refuge under stones and dry leaves, or crawl slowly\r\nalong the ground; whilst the males, which fly with great ease, are on\r\nthe plants and brushwood. These insects are not rare in the environs\r\nof Paris. M. H. Lucas has observed, in Algeria, near to Oran, another\r\ncurious species, the _Drilus Mauritanicus_. The larva of this insect\r\nlives at the expense of the animal of the _Cyclostoma Volzianum_,\r\nwhich closes the entrance to its shell with a covering of some\r\ncalcareous substance. It fixes itself on the edge of the shell, with\r\nthe aid of its sucker, and directs its strong mandibles to the side on\r\nwhich the snail is obliged to raise the covering, either to breathe\r\nthe air or to walk. In this position it has the patience to wait for\r\nmany days at the door. The snail puts off for as long a time as he is\r\nable the fatal moment. But when, overcome by hunger or nearly stifled\r\nin his prison, he decides at last to open the door, the _Drilus_\r\nprofits immediately by this opportunity, and cuts the muscle which\r\nkeeps back the foot of the snail. The breach being made, nothing more\r\nopposes itself to the entrance of the enemy. He slips in, and sets\r\nto work to eat at his leisure the unfortunate inoffensive mollusc,\r\nwhich affords him board and lodging. The _Ptilodadylides_, the\r\n_Eucinetides_, and the _Cebrionides_ belong to the same family. The\r\nfirst is exotic.\r\n\r\nThe _Elateridæ_ are rather large insects, often of hard texture,\r\nhaving the prosternum prolonged into a point (Figs. 551 and 552), and\r\nthe antennæ indented saw-wise. They have the power of jumping when\r\nplaced on their backs, and of alighting again on their legs. Hence\r\ntheir name of _Elater_ (derived from the same root as the word\r\n_elastic_). They produce, in leaping, one sharp rap, and often knock\r\nmany raps when they are prevented from projecting themselves. This is\r\nthe mechanism which permits the skip-jack to execute these movements.\r\nIt bends itself upwards by resting on the ground by its head and the\r\nextremity of the abdomen, and then it unbends itself suddenly, like a\r\nspring. The point at the end of the thorax penetrates into a hollow of\r\nthe next ring; the back then strikes with force against the plane on\r\nwhich it rests, and the animal is projected into the air. It repeats\r\nthis manoeuvre till it finds itself on its belly, for its legs are\r\ntoo short to allow of its turning over. Its structure supplies it with\r\nthe means and the strength of rebounding as many times as it falls on\r\nits back, and it can thus raise itself more than twelve times the\r\nlength of its body.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the genus _Elateridæ_ (Fig. 553) are cylindrical, with a\r\nscaly skin and very short legs. They live in rotten wood or in the\r\nroots of plants. According to M. Goureau, they pass five years in this\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the genus _Agriotes_ occasion considerable damage to\r\nwheat-fields. They have much resemblance to the meal-worm, or larva of\r\nthe _Tenebrio_. The _Tetralobides_ are the largest of the _Elateridæ_,\r\nattaining to a length of two inches; and are inhabitants of Africa and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nIn America are found phosphorescent _Elateridæ_. These are the\r\n_Pyrophori_, which the Spaniards of South America call by the name of\r\n_Cucuyos_. They have, at the base of their thorax, two small, smooth,\r\nand brilliant spots, which sparkle during the night; the rings of the\r\nabdomen also emit a light. They give light sufficient to enable one\r\nto read at a little distance from them. The _Pyrophorus noctilucus_\r\n(Fig. 554) is very common in Havannah, in Brazil, in Guyana, in\r\nMexico, &c., and may be seen at night in great numbers, amongst the\r\nfoliage of trees. At the time of the Spanish conquest, a battalion,\r\njust disembarked, did not dare to engage with the natives, because it\r\ntook the Cucuyos which were shining on the neighbouring trees for the\r\nmatches of the arquebuses ready to fire. \"In these countries,\" says M.\r\nMichelet, \"one travels much by night, to escape the heat. But one\r\nwould not dare to plunge into the peopled shades of the deep forests\r\nif these insects did not reassure the traveller. He sees them shining\r\nafar off, dancing, twisting about; he sees them near at hand on the\r\nbushes by his side; he takes them with him; he fixes them on his\r\nboots, so that they may show him his road and put to flight the\r\nserpents; but when the sun rises, gratefully and carefully he places\r\nthem on a shrub, and restores them to their amorous occupations. It is\r\na beautiful Indian proverb that says, 'Carry away the fire-fly, but\r\nrestore it from whence thou tookest it'\"[127] The Creole women make\r\nuse of the Cucuyos to increase the splendour of their toilettes.\r\nStrange jewels! which must be fed, which must be bathed twice a day,\r\nand must be incessantly taken care of, to prevent them from dying. The\r\nIndians catch these insects by balancing hot coals in the air, at the\r\nend of a stick, to attract them, which proves that the light which\r\nthese insects diffuse is to attract. Once in the hands of the women,\r\nthe Cucuyos are shut up in little cages of very fine wire, and fed on\r\nfragments of sugar-cane. When the Mexican ladies wish to adorn\r\nthemselves with these living diamonds, they place them in little bags\r\nof light tulle, which they arrange with taste on their skirts. There\r\nis another way of mounting the Cucuyos. They pass a pin, without\r\nhurting them, under the thorax, and stick this pin in their hair. The\r\nrefinement of elegance consists in combining with the Cucuyos,\r\nhumming-birds and real diamonds, which produce a dazzling head-dress.\r\nSometimes, imprisoning these animated flames in gauze, the graceful\r\nMexican women twist them into ardent necklaces, or else roll them\r\nround their waists, like a fiery girdle. They go to the ball under a\r\ndiadem of living topazes, of animated emeralds, and this diadem blazes\r\nor pales according as the insect is fresh or fatigued. When they\r\nreturn home, after the _soirée_, they make them take a bath, which\r\nrefreshes them, and put them back again into the cage, which sheds\r\nduring the whole night a soft light in the chamber. In 1766, a Cucuyo,\r\nbrought alive from America to Paris, probably in some old piece of\r\nwood which happened to be on the vessel, caused great terror to the\r\ninhabitants of the Faubourg St. Antoine, when they saw it flying in\r\nthe evening, glittering in the air. In 1864 a number of Cucuyos were\r\nbrought from Mexico to Paris by M. Laurent, captain of the frigate _La\r\nFloride_. An experiment, made in the laboratory of the École Normal,\r\nshowed that the spectrum of their light is continuous, without any\r\nblack rays; it differs, besides, from the spectrum of the solar light\r\nby a greater intensity of the yellow colour. The light is produced\r\nprobably as it is in the case of the _Lampyris_, by the slow\r\ncombustion of a substance secreted by the animal. The Cucuyo can,\r\nnevertheless, at will, increase or diminish the splendour of this\r\nlight by means of membranes which it superposes, like screens, in\r\nfront of the phosphorescent bumps which it has on its thorax.\r\n\r\n    [127] \"L'Insecte.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 554.--The Cucuyo (_Pyrophorus noctilucus_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 555.--Buprestis (Cyria) imperialis.]\r\n\r\nIn the Indies, and in China, the women use for dressing their hair\r\nwith, or as ear-rings, another Coleopteron of the same tribe, which\r\nbegins even to be employed for this purpose by the women of the south\r\nof France. It is a _Buprestis_, of splendid colours, and of metallic\r\nbrightness. Linnæus, as we said above, gave to it, wrongly, the name\r\nof _Buprestis_, which among the ancients served to designate a very\r\ndifferent insect, the _Meloë_, of the family of the _Cantharidæ_; but\r\nmodern naturalists have allowed this illegitimate title.\r\n\r\nThe _Buprestidæ_ walk heavily, but fly with the greatest ease during\r\nthe heat of the sun, and settle on the trunks of trees exposed to its\r\nrays. In Europe, and especially in the North, they are very rare, and\r\nof very small size. They must be looked for on birch-trees, whose\r\nwhite colour seems to attract them. In the hottest parts of the world\r\nthey are very abundant, of large dimensions, and adorned with\r\nsparkling colours. They do not jump, and are not endowed with the\r\nphosphorescent property. Their larvæ have no legs, are elongate,\r\nwhitish, of a fleshy consistency, with the first ring of their bodies\r\nvery much broadened. They live in the trunks of trees, between the\r\nbark and the wood, hollowing out for themselves irregular galleries,\r\nand remaining sometimes in this state for ten years before\r\nmetamorphosing. Laporte de Castelnau and Gory have described and made\r\ndrawings of about 1,300 species of _Buprestidæ_. Fig. 555 represents\r\nthe _Buprestis imperialis_. The _Buprestis albosparsa_, the genera\r\n_Julodis_, the _Chrysochroas_, and the _Trachys_ belong also to the\r\ngreat family of _Buprestidæ_. The _Cleridæ_ are connected with the\r\npreceding. They have the thorax narrower than the elytra, and rather\r\nlong; their integuments are less solid than those of the _Elateridæ_\r\nand the _Buprestidæ_. The latter are phytophagous, the former\r\ncarnivorous. The principal type of this family is the _Clerus\r\nformicarius_, russety, with the head and legs black, whose larva lives\r\nat the expense of the larvæ of the weevil. Another genus, the\r\n_Necrobia_, which lives on dried animal matter, has become celebrated,\r\nas it was the cause of the salvation of the greatest entomologist of\r\nFrance. The name of _Necrobia_ (from [Greek: nekros] and [Greek:\r\nbiôs]) does not mean \"which lives on dead bodies,\" but it means \"life\r\nin death.\" Here is the story of which this name is destined to\r\npreserve the remembrance, and which Latreille himself has related in\r\nhis \"Histoire des Insectes.\" Before 1792, Latreille was known only\r\nfrom some memoirs which he had published on insects. He was then\r\npriest at Brives-la-Gaillarde, and was arrested with the curés of\r\nLimousin, who had not taken the oath. These unfortunates were then\r\ntaken to Bordeaux in carts, to be transported to Guyana. Arrived at\r\nBordeaux in the month of June, they were incarcerated in the prison of\r\nthe Grand Séminaire till a ship should be ready to take them on board.\r\nIn the meanwhile, the 9th Thermidor arrived, and caused the execution\r\nof the sentence which condemned the priests who had not taken the oath\r\nto transportation to be for a while suspended. However, the prisons\r\nemptied themselves but slowly, and those who had been condemned had\r\nnone the less to go into exile, only their transportation had been put\r\noff till the spring.\r\n\r\n\"Latreille remained detained at the prison of the Grand Séminaire. In\r\nthe same chamber which he occupied there was at the time an old sick\r\nbishop, whose wounds a surgeon came each morning to dress. One day as\r\nthe surgeon was dressing the bishop's wounds, an insect came out of a\r\ncrack in the boards. Latreille seized it immediately, examined it,\r\nstuck it on a cork with a pin, and seemed enchanted at what he had\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a rare insect, then?\" said the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\n\"In that case you should give it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have a friend who has a fine collection of insects, who\r\nwould be pleased with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, take him this insect; tell him how you came by it, and beg\r\nhim to tell me its name.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon went quickly to his friend's house. This friend was Bory\r\nde Saint Vincent, a naturalist who became celebrated afterwards, but\r\nwho was very young at that time. He already occupied himself much with\r\nthe natural sciences, and in particular with the classing of insects.\r\nThe surgeon delivered to him the one found by the priest, but in spite\r\nof all his researches, he was unable to class it.\r\n\r\nNext day the surgeon having seen Latreille again in his prison, was\r\nobliged to confess to him that in his friend's opinion this\r\nColeopteron had never been described. Latreille knew by this answer\r\nthat Bory de Saint Vincent was an adept. As they gave the prisoner\r\nneither pen nor paper, he said to his messenger, \"I see plainly that\r\nM. Bory de Saint Vincent must know my name. You tell him that I am the\r\nAbbé Latreille, and that I am going to die at Guyana, before having\r\npublished my 'Examen des Genres de Fabricius.'\"\r\n\r\nBory, on receiving this piece of news, took active steps, and obtained\r\nleave for Latreille to come out of his prison, as a convalescent, his\r\nuncle Dayclas and his father being bail for him, and pledging\r\nthemselves formally to deliver up the prisoner the moment they were\r\nsummoned to do so by the authorities. The vessel which was to have\r\nconducted Latreille to exile, or rather to death, was getting ready\r\nwhilst these steps were being taken, and while Bory and Dayclas were\r\nobtaining leave for him to come out of prison. This was quite\r\nprovidential, for it foundered in sight of Cordova, and the sailors\r\nalone were able to save themselves. A little time afterwards his\r\nfriends managed to have his name scratched out from the list of\r\nexiles. It is thus that the _Necrobia ruficollis_ was the saving of\r\nLatreille.\r\n\r\nThe tribe of weevils is even much more numerous than that of the\r\n_Elateridæ_ and the _Buprestidæ_. One may know them by their head\r\nprolonged into a snout or trunk, by their rudimentary mouth, and by\r\ntheir elbowed antennæ. About twenty thousand species are said to\r\nexist. They feed on vegetables. Their larvæ are soft, whitish worms,\r\nwithout legs, with very small heads, and live in the interior of the\r\nstalks or seeds of plants, often occasioning enormous damage. They are\r\none of the plagues of agriculture. Each of our dry vegetables, each\r\nvariety of our cereals, has in this immense family its particular\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nFirst are the _Bruchi_. The Pea Weevil (_Bruchus pisi_, Fig. 556),\r\nwhich is brown with white spots, comes out of the pea at the end of\r\nthe summer. The female lays her eggs on peas which are ripe, and still\r\nstanding, in which the larva scoops out a habitation, and then makes\r\nits exit by a circular hole (Fig. 557). It remains at rest all the\r\nwinter, and is not hatched till towards the following spring. The Bean\r\nWeevil (_Bruchus rufimanus_) marks each bean with many black spots.\r\nThe vetch has also its special _Bruchus_. The Wheat Weevil (_Calandra\r\ngranaria_), of a darkish brown, lays its eggs on the grains, of which\r\nthe larvæ then eat the interior. A host of ways of getting rid of the\r\nweevil have been proposed. The best means is to store corn properly,\r\nand to keep the heap well aired. Let us mention further, the Clover\r\nWeevil, belonging to the genus _Apion_, the Weevil of the Rape\r\n(_Ceutorhynchus brassicæ_), the Turnip Weevil, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nFig. 556.--Pea Weevil (_Bruchus pisi_), magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 557.--Pea pierced by the larva.\r\n\r\nAll vegetables, the vine, fruit trees, the ash, pines, &c., are eaten\r\nby some weevil or other. As an example we give a figure of the spotted\r\n_Pissodes pini_, which, as the figure shows, takes the precaution of\r\ncutting half through the young stems and the stalks of the buds of the\r\npine, \"so as,\" says M. Maurice Girard,[128] \"that the sap flows only\r\nwith difficulty into the withered organ, and cannot suffocate the\r\nyoung larvæ.\"\r\n\r\n    [128] \"Metamorphoses des Insectes,\" p. 116.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 558.--Pissodes pini.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 559.--Hylesinus piniperda.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 560.--Larva of Scolytus.]\r\n\r\n_Scolytus_, _Hylesinus_, and _Bostrichus_, which are connected with\r\nthe weevils, hollow out galleries between the wood and the bark of\r\ndifferent trees, when in the larva state, and devour the leaves in the\r\nadult state. Fig. 559 represents the _Hylesinus piniperda_. The\r\n_Scolyti_ are sometimes so numerous in the forests, that the trees are\r\ntattooed all over by the larvæ. In 1837, they were obliged to cut\r\ndown, in the Bois de Vincennes, 20,000 feet of oak trees, aged from\r\nthirty to forty years, completely ruined by the ravages of the\r\n_Scolytus_, whose larva is here represented (Fig. 560). The genus\r\n_Tomicus_, hairy, and of a tawny colour, are a terrible plague to pine\r\nforests. In 1783, in the Forest of Hartz, 1,500,000 of trees were\r\ndestroyed by these insects. Often have the priests implored, in the\r\nchurches, the Divine clemency, to put an end to the devastations made\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nWe arrive at the tribe of the _Longicornes_, which contains beautiful\r\ninsects, of elegant shape and varied colours, sometimes also of rather\r\nlarge dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 561.--Imago and pupa of Cerambyx heros.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cerambyx_ has the antennæ very long; they exceed in some of\r\nthe species two or three times the length of the body. The larvæ are\r\nlarge whitish worms, which live in the wood of trees, the adult\r\ninsects frequenting flowers, rotten trees, &c. In the month of June,\r\non the Continent, one meets on the oaks with the Great Capricorne\r\n(_Cerambyx heros_, Fig. 561), of a dark brown, whose larva (Fig. 562)\r\nscoops out its galleries in the interior of the tree, and often\r\noccasions much damage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 562.--Larva of Cerambyx heros.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 563.--Larva of Lina populi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 564.--Larva and imago of Crioceris merdigera.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 565.--Lady-bird (_Coccinella septempunctata_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 566.--Larva of the Lady-bird.]\r\n\r\nThe _Chrysomelidæ_ are other phytophagous insects, dressed in the\r\nbrightest colours, having short and thick-set bodies. The larvæ, soft\r\nand ovoid, devour the leaves of trees. One of the best known species\r\nis _Lina populi_, of a bronzed colour, with red elytra, whose larva\r\n(Fig. 563), of a greenish grey, devours the leaves of the poplar-tree.\r\nThe _Galerucæ_ and the _Alticæ_ belong to the same family, as also do\r\nthe _Cassidæ_, the _Crioceres_, and the _Donaciæ_. The _Cassida\r\nviridis_ frequents nettles and artichokes; the elytra are of rounded\r\nform. Fig. 564 represents the _Crioceris merdigera_, a great rarity\r\nin this country. The _Crioceris asparagi_, or Asparagus Beetle,\r\ntawny, and barred with black, resembles it in habit.\r\n\r\nThe last tribe of Coleoptera comprises the _Coccinellidæ_, or\r\nLady-birds (Fig. 565). These little globular, smooth insects, red or\r\nyellow, with black spots, are very useful to us, for they clear the\r\ntrees of the aphides and other mischievous insects. Their larvæ (Fig.\r\n566) make use of their front legs to carry their prey to their mouths.\r\nWhen danger threatens a _Coccinella_, it hides its feet under its\r\nbody, and remains sticking to the stem of the bush. If you touch it,\r\nit allows itself to fall to the ground, but sometimes opens its\r\nelytra, and flies off rapidly. It also exudes from the articulations\r\nof its abdomen a yellow mucilaginous liquid, of a pungent and\r\ndisagreeable odour. This is the only means of defence possessed by\r\nthis little inoffensive being, which deserves in all respects the name\r\nof \"Bête à bon Dieu,\" which the French children give it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n*** ITALICS ARE WOODCUT ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abdomen, The, 1, 167.\r\n\r\n  Abdominal Cavity, contraction and dilation of, 16.\r\n\r\n  Abraxas grossulariata, 268.\r\n\r\n  Acalyptera, 70, 85.\r\n\r\n  Acanthia ciliata, 94.\r\n    \"      lectularia, 92.\r\n\r\n  Acanthops, 291.\r\n\r\n  Acherontia Atropos, 203, 204.\r\n\r\n  Acilius fasciatus, 480.\r\n    \"       \"        _Male and Female_, 480.\r\n    \"     sulcatus, 480.\r\n    \"       \"       _Male and Female_, 480.\r\n\r\n  Acridium, 300.\r\n    \"       migratorium, 301.\r\n\r\n  _Acrocinus longimanus, Thorax of_, 6.\r\n\r\n  Acronycta aceris, Larva of, 151.\r\n    \"         \"     _Larvæ of_, 152, 153 (_three figs._).\r\n\r\n  Ædia pusiella, 269.\r\n    \"  _pusiella_, 269.\r\n\r\n  Ædipoda migratorium, 301.\r\n\r\n  Agrion, 423.\r\n\r\n  Agriotes, Larvæ of the Genus, 512.\r\n\r\n  Ailanthus Silkworm, 245.\r\n\r\n  Alimentary Canal of Insects, 8, _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Alticæ, 520.\r\n\r\n  Alucita granella, The, 279.\r\n\r\n  Amphidasis betularia, 268.\r\n\r\n  _Andrenæ, Gallery of an_, 367.\r\n    \"       The, 367.\r\n\r\n  Anomala, 456.\r\n    \"      Vitis, 456.\r\n\r\n  Anostostomæ, The, 300.\r\n\r\n  Ant, 313, 377.\r\n    \"  Ashy, 382.\r\n    \"    \"   _Male, Female, and Worker_, 382.\r\n    \"  Ashy-black, 382.\r\n    \"    \"         _Male, Female, and Worker_, 382.\r\n    \"  Black, 382.\r\n    \"  Blood-red, 382, 393.\r\n    \"  _Blood-red_, 390.\r\n    \"  _Brazilian Umbrella_, 379.\r\n    \"  Brown, 382.\r\n    \"  _Ant, Hill, section of_, 381.\r\n    \"  Jet, 382.\r\n    \"  Mason, 382.\r\n    \"  Mining, 382, 392.\r\n    \"    \"     _Male, Female, and Worker_, 392.\r\n    \"  _Nest, sections of_, 379.\r\n    \"  Red, 380, 382, 383, 390.\r\n    \"    \"  _Larva of_, 383.\r\n    \"    \"  _Male, magnified_, 378.\r\n    \"    \"  Pupa of, 383.\r\n    \"    \"  _Pupa of_, 383.\r\n    \"  Russety, 382, 390.\r\n    \"  _Russet_, 390.\r\n    \"  Turf, 382.\r\n    \"  Yellow, 382.\r\n    \"  White, _see_ Termes.\r\n    \"    \"    _Nests of_, 403, 410.\r\n\r\n  Antennæ, 5;
