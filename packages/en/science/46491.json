By T. H. HUXLEY,\r\nEsq., F.R.S., F.L.S., Prof. of Nat. History, Gov. School of Mines.\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 17th, 1859.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of a recent investigation into the nature of the singular\r\nextinct reptile, _Stagonolepis_, I was led to inquire somewhat\r\nminutely into the character of the exoskeleton, or dermal armour, of\r\nthe existing _Crocodilia_. To my surprise, I found that very little\r\ndetailed information on the subject was to be obtained from the standard\r\nrepertories of Comparative Anatomy, or even from the special monographs\r\non Crocodilian structure and classification; but I was still more\r\nastonished to discover, among whole genera of recent _Crocodilia_,\r\nan exoskeleton possessed of characters such as have been universally\r\nsupposed to be peculiar to long extinct forms of the order, and whose\r\nexistence in any recent species has hitherto, so far as I can ascertain,\r\nbeen completely overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to discover the limits within which this remarkable\r\nexoskeleton is to be found, led me to look, more critically than I had\r\npreviously done, into the arrangement and specific characterization\r\nof the recent _Crocodilia_. I have thereby arrived at results which,\r\nimperfect as they are, may be of service by leading others to inquire\r\ninto the exact characters of species not at present within my reach;\r\nand I therefore propose to preface my account of the peculiarities of\r\nthe exoskeleton in two of the genera of recent Crocodiles with some\r\nremarks on the classification of the group, and with a few notes upon\r\nthe characters of the species and the limits of the genera.\r\n\r\nEveryone is acquainted with the great improvement effected in this\r\nbranch of Herpetology by Cuvier, who divided the Crocodiles, which he\r\nregarded as constituting only a single genus, into the three subgenera\r\n_Alligatores_, _Crocodili_, and _Longirostres_. Subsequent writers\r\nhave admitted these highly natural subdivisions; but there has been a\r\nconstant tendency to raise their rank. The genus _Crocodilus_ has become\r\nthe order _Crocodilia_; the subgenera _Alligatores_, &c., have been\r\nelevated into families; Dr. Gray has shown that the _Alligatores_ must\r\nbe divided into three genera, and that there are at least two genera of\r\n_Crocodili_; and, while one of Cuvier's species of _Longirostres_ has\r\nbeen suppressed, the group is very generally retained with a changed\r\nname (_Gavialis_), a very important addition having been made to it in\r\nthe _Crocodilus Schlegelii_ of Müller and Schlegel.\r\n\r\nUnless the considerable materials contained in the British Museum, the\r\nHunterian collection, the collection of Dr. Grant, and the Christchurch\r\nMuseum at Oxford had been freely placed at my disposal, I should have\r\nbeen wholly unable to acquire the information contained in the following\r\npages. It is only right, therefore, that I should take this opportunity\r\nof offering my thanks to my friends Dr. Gray, Prof. Quekett, Dr. Grant,\r\nand Dr. Rolleston for the many facilities they have liberally afforded\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe recent species of the order _Crocodilia_ are divisible into three\r\nfamilies, which correspond with the original subgenera of Cuvier, and\r\nmay be termed the _Alligatoridæ_, the _Crocodilidæ_, and the\r\n_Gavialidæ_.\r\n\r\nI. In the ALLIGATORIDÆ the teeth are strong and unequal, and the\r\nposterior ones differ greatly in shape from the anterior. The anterior\r\npair of mandibular teeth, and the fourth pair (or the so-called canines)\r\nare received into pits in the margins of the premaxilla and maxilla;\r\nwhile the mandibular teeth behind these pass inside, and not between,\r\nthe maxillary teeth. The mandibular symphysis does not extend back\r\nbeyond the level of the fifth tooth, and often not nearly so far. The\r\nline of the premaxillo-maxillary suture on the palate is straight,\r\nor convex forwards. The wide posterior nares look downwards, and are\r\nsituated forwards on the palate.\r\n\r\nThis family embraces three genera, readily distinguishable by\r\nosteological characters--_Alligator_, _Caiman_, and _Jacare_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 1. ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\nDental formula, 20-20/20-20. 9th maxillary tooth the largest of\r\nits series. The snout is very broad, flattened, and rounded at the\r\nend. There is an indistinct longitudinal interorbital ridge; and there\r\nare two short ridges along the line of junction of the prefrontal\r\nand lachrymal bones. The aperture of the external nares is divided\r\ninto two parts, by the prolongation forwards of the nasal bones. The\r\nsupra-temporal fossæ are well-marked and open, though not large. The\r\nvomers do not appear in the palate. The feet are well webbed. The dorsal\r\nbony scutes are not articulated together; and there are no ventral\r\nscutes.\r\n\r\nThis genus contains only one species, the well-known _Alligator\r\nMississipiensis_, or _lucius_, which is exclusively North American.\r\n\r\nCuvier (Oss. Foss. ed. 4. vol. ix. p. 211) gives the appearance of the\r\nvomer in the palate as a general character of the _Alligatores_; but\r\nthis bone is not visible in the palate of any of those _Alligatores_\r\nwhich Cuvier would have referred to his _A. lucius_ or _A. palpebrosus_,\r\nand which form the genera _Alligator_ and _Caiman_ as here defined. The\r\nvomers are in fact as slender and delicate as in the Crocodile, and\r\nextend only between the level of the tenth maxillary tooth anteriorly\r\nand the descending processes of the prefrontal posteriorly.\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the median nares, or the arch formed by the\r\npostero-lateral part of the vomer and the anterior and superior lamina\r\nof the palatine bone on each side (which would constitute the posterior\r\nboundary of the posterior nares, if the palatine and pterygoid bones\r\ngave off no inferior or palatine processes), are situated nearly on a\r\nlevel with the twelfth tooth, or with the palato-maxillary suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2. CAIMAN.\r\n\r\nDental formula 20-20/22-22 (Natterer). The face is without median\r\nor transverse ridges, but it is sharply angulated along a line which\r\nextends from the orbit forwards along the sides of the snout. The\r\nanterior nasal aperture is undivided in the dry skull. The vomers do\r\nnot appear in the palate. The supra-temporal fossæ are obliterated,\r\nthe circumjacent bones uniting over them. The webs of the feet are\r\nrudimentary. The dorsal scutes are articulated together by lateral\r\nsutures and anterior and posterior facets; and there is a ventral\r\nshield, consisting of similarly articulated scutes.\r\n\r\nNatterer[1] has described three species of _Caiman_--_C. palpebrosus_,\r\n_C. trigonatus_, and _C. gibbiceps_. The Caimans abound chiefly in\r\ntropical South America; but they are found as far north as Mexico, a\r\nspecimen of _C. palpebrosus_ in Dr. Grant's collection coming from that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 3. JACARE.\r\n\r\nThe snout is broad, and rounded at the end[2]. Each prefrontal bone\r\nis traversed close to its anterior extremity by the ends of a strong\r\ntransverse ridge, which then curve round and pass forwards on the\r\nlachrymal and maxillary bones, to subside opposite the ninth tooth.\r\nThe anterior nasal aperture is not divided by bone. The vomers,\r\nseparated by a longitudinal suture, appear in the palate between the\r\npremaxillaries and the palatine plates of the maxillaries. The temporal\r\nfossæ, though not large, are open. The webs of the feet are small. The\r\ndorsal scutes are articulated together, as in the preceding genus; and\r\nthere are similarly-articulated ventral scutes. There are 18-20 teeth\r\non each side, above and below; and the fourth tooth in the upper jaw is\r\nthe largest. The mandibular symphysis extends back nearly to the fifth\r\ntooth.\r\n\r\nIn a skull of _Jacare_ (_fissipes?_), 19 inches long, in the British\r\nMuseum, I find that part of the vomer which is visible in the palate to\r\nbe a rhomboidal plate, somewhat truncated anteriorly, and rather more\r\nthan 1-1/2 inch long and 1 inch wide. Its anterior end comes within\r\n3/8ths of an inch of the posterior margin of the anterior palatal\r\nforamen. Its posterior margin reaches to the level of the eighth tooth.\r\nThe visible portion of each vomer is only its anterior end, which forms\r\na thick and solid wedge-shaped plate, broader in front than behind, and\r\narticulating by a rough anterior and outer face with the premaxilla, by\r\nan obliquely ridged posterior and outer face with the maxilla, and by\r\nits internal face with its fellow. Its upper, rounded surface projects\r\nbut little into the nasal passage. 2-1/4 inches behind its anterior\r\nend, the posterior and upper extremity of the vomer passes into a thin\r\nand narrow plate of bone, whose plane is at first inclined at an angle\r\nof 45° to that of the anterior part of the bone, but gradually becomes\r\nvertical; as it does so it deepens, until, 3 inches behind the anterior\r\nextremity, the vomer is a thin vertical plate of bone, 5/8ths of\r\nan inch deep, which articulates below with the palatine plate of the\r\nmaxilla, and, about 1 inch behind this, with the palatine plate of the\r\npalatine bone. The upper edge of this plate nowhere extends to one-third\r\nof the height of the nasal chamber. It gives off a horizontal process\r\noutwards, which, gradually increasing in width, inclines downwards until\r\nit comes into contact, first, with the inner surface of the maxilla,\r\nand, 3/4ths of an inch behind this, with the nasal plate of the\r\npalatine bone. In front of its junction with the maxilla, the horizontal\r\nplate of the vomer presents a long free edge, concave externally; and\r\nthis bounds the median nares internally and posteriorly. Throughout its\r\njunction with the maxilla, the horizontal plate is parallel-sided; but\r\nafter it joins the palatine bone, it gradually narrows posteriorly,\r\nin consequence of the gradual increase in width of the palatine, and\r\nends almost in a point, 6-1/4 inches behind its anterior end. The\r\nposterior edge of the vertical plate is extremely thin, and 7/8ths\r\nof an inch deep. It articulates with the anterior end of the vertical\r\nplate of the pterygoid, while the straight inferior edge articulates\r\nthroughout with the palatine plate of the palatine bone. The vomers\r\nterminate midway between the median nares and the descending process of\r\nthe prefrontal. The median nares are bounded entirely by the vomer and\r\nthe maxilla. They correspond with the nasal face of the palato-maxillary\r\nsuture, but are rather behind its palatine face, and they are about on\r\na level with the interval between the tenth and eleventh teeth. If the\r\nanterior edge of the palatine bone bounded them, they would be a little\r\nbehind the twelfth tooth. The posterior nares, 2-1/8 inches wide, by\r\n7/8ths of an inch long, look altogether downwards, are completely\r\ndivided by a bony septum, and have the form of a rhomboid with its\r\nnarrowest side posterior. They are surrounded by a strong raised ridge,\r\nincomplete only at the anterior and outer angles of the rhomboid.\r\n\r\nFive species of _Jacare_ are enumerated by Natterer--_J. fissipes_, _J.\r\nsclerops_, _J. nigra_, _J. punctulata_, and _J. vallifrons_. They have\r\nmet with only in South America.\r\n\r\n    [1] \"Beitrag zur näheren Kenntniss der Sudamerikanischen\r\n    Alligatoren,\" 'Annalen des Wiener Mus.,' Band i.\r\n\r\n    [2] According to Natterer, the dental formula of _J. nigra_ and\r\n    _J. fissipes_ is 18-18/18-18, of _J. sclerops_ 19-19/20-20, of _J.\r\n    callifrons_ and _J. punctulata_ 20-20/18-18.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. In the family of the CROCODILIDÆ the teeth are usually strong and\r\nvery unequal in size, and there is always a considerable difference\r\nbetween the anterior and the posterior teeth. The two anterior\r\nmandibular teeth are received into pits in the premaxilla; but the\r\ncanines pass into grooves (which may be converted into fossæ) situated\r\nat the junction of the premaxilla and maxilla. The other mandibular\r\nteeth are received between the maxillary teeth. The symphysis of the\r\nlower jaw does not extend beyond the level of the seventh or the eighth\r\nmandibular tooth. The premaxillo-maxillary suture may be either straight\r\nor strongly convex backwards. The divided vomers do not appear in\r\nthe palate. The posterior nares look more or less backwards, and are\r\ntransversely elongated. The supra-temporal fossæ are always open, and\r\nthe feet are distinctly webbed. The dorsal scutes are not articulated;\r\nand there are no ventral scutes.\r\n\r\nTwo genera, _Crocodilus_ and _Mecistops_, are distinguishable in this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 4. CROCODILUS.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are always strong and very unequal, the strongest in the upper\r\njaw being the tenth. The mandibular symphysis does not extend beyond the\r\nlevel of the sixth tooth. There are usually six cervical scutes, in two\r\nrows, or forming a rhomb, and separated by a distinct interval from the\r\ntergal scutes. There are 18 or 19 teeth above, and 15 below, on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Crocodilus vulgaris._\r\n\r\nAs Cuvier has remarked, it is extremely difficult to find good\r\ndistinctive characters for all the species of this genus. My first\r\ndifficulty was to ascertain the precise characters of that species which\r\nhas been misnamed _vulgaris_, inasmuch as I could find neither in the\r\nBritish Museum, nor in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, any\r\n_authentic_ skeleton or skull of this, the so-called Nilotic Crocodile.\r\nThis difficulty subsisted up to the time that the chief statements\r\ncontained in the present essay were laid before the Linnean Society; but\r\nsince then I have been enabled, by Dr. Gray's permission, to examine the\r\nskull of a small stuffed specimen, brought to this country from Egypt\r\nby Sir Gardner Wilkinson, and to study the splendid entire skeleton of\r\na _Crocodilus vulgaris_ in the Christchurch Museum at Oxford, presented\r\nto that Institution by the gentlemen who shot it on the Nile, and set\r\nup with great care under the auspices of my friend Dr. Rolleston, Lee's\r\nReader in Anatomy and Curator of the Museum. Fortunately the entire\r\nskin has been preserved; so that this is the most complete record of\r\nthe hard parts of any individual crocodile with which I am acquainted,\r\nbesides being, so far as I am aware, the only authentic entire skeleton\r\nof _Crocodilus vulgaris_ in this country. I subjoin the chief points\r\nof interest which I noted in my brief examination of this valuable\r\nspecimen:--\r\n\r\n                                                       Inches.\r\n\r\n  The total length of the skeleton is                     114\r\n      \"       \"      \"    skull                            16\r\n  Between the outer edges of the posterior ends of\r\n      the quadrate bones                                    8-3/4\r\n  From the snout to the middle of the canine notch          2-3/4\r\n  Transverse diameter of snout opposite 10th tooth          4-7/8\r\n  Long axis of orbit                                        2-1/4\r\n  Short axis of orbit                                       1-5/8\r\n  Interorbital space opposite the middle of the orbit       1-3/4\r\n  Anterior edge of the orbit from end of snout             10-1/2\r\n  Syncipital[3] area in length, about                       2-1/2\r\n      \"          \"   in breadth anteriorly                  3-3/4\r\n      \"          \"       \"      posteriorly                 4\r\n  Supra-temporal fossæ, wide                                 7/8\r\n      \"     \"           long                                1-1/8\r\n  Least width of parietal                                    7/16\r\n  Total length of mandible                                 20-1/2\r\n  Its greatest depth                                        3\r\n  Length of cervical region (or anterior 8 vertebræ)       10-1/2\r\n     \"      dorso-lumbar region                            27\r\n     \"      sacral          \"                               3-3/4\r\n  Length of humerus                                         7-1/2\r\n     \"      ulna                                            5-1/4\r\n     \"      fore foot, extreme length                       6\r\n     \"      femur                                           8-1/2\r\n     \"      tibia                                           6\r\n     \"      hind foot, extreme length                       9-1/4\r\n\r\nFrom the above measurements it will be seen that the skull is somewhat\r\nslender. Behind the canine groove it widens to the tenth tooth, which\r\nis 5-3/4 inches behind the end of the snout. It retains about the\r\nsame diameter to the twelfth tooth, and then slowly widens again,--a\r\nsudden increase in size, to the extent of half-an-inch, taking place\r\nopposite the posterior margin of the orbit, owing to the flanging-out\r\nof the jugal. On the whole, however, there is a slow and even increase\r\nin breadth, from the canine groove to the ends of the ossa quadrata.\r\nThe nasal aperture is pyriform, its wider end being forwards, and its\r\nnarrow posterior extremity, into which the pointed ends of the nasal\r\nbones project, attaining the level of the first tooth behind the canine\r\ngroove.\r\n\r\n    [3] By this term I denote that squarish flat area bounded by\r\n    the postfrontal and squamosal bones laterally, by the occiput\r\n    posteriorly, and by a line joining the outer angles of the\r\n    postfrontals anteriorly.\r\n\r\nOn the left side there is only a pit for the reception of the\r\nanterior mandibular tooth, while on the right side this pit is\r\nconverted into a complete foramen. On the upper face of the skull, the\r\npremaxillo-maxillary suture runs vertically upwards through the canine\r\ngroove, and then passes obliquely backwards to a point 5 inches behind\r\nthe end of the snout. The anterior part of this suture lies in a strong\r\nridge, which is continued downwards and forwards on the premaxilla to\r\nthe level of the fifth tooth, a groove separating it from the margin\r\nof the nasal aperture. Posteriorly this ridge dies away, but a curved\r\nirregular elevation, convex inwards, arises opposite the tenth tooth. It\r\nis wholly confined to the maxilla, not extending on to the nasals.\r\n\r\nThere is a distinct, rough, irregular elevation, bounded on its\r\nouter side by a sharp groove, which extends back to the orbit, on\r\nthe lachrymal bone. The profile of the skull is convex as far as the\r\nposterior boundary of the nostril, and very slightly concave from that\r\npoint as far as the twelfth tooth. It then passes back as a straight,\r\nslightly ascending line, only interrupted by the lachrymal ridge, to\r\nthe margin of the occiput. The inferior margin of the maxilla is convex\r\ndownwards as far as the canine groove, whose lower end is indicated by\r\na deep sinuation. It then becomes convex again, the crown of the curve\r\nbeing at the ninth and tenth teeth, and its posterior end sweeping into\r\na concavity whose summit is at the twelfth tooth. Behind this the edge\r\nof the maxilla is only slightly convex. The inferior contour of the\r\njugal bone is very concave; but the articular end of the quadrate bone\r\ndescends to the level of the edge of the ninth alveolus.\r\n\r\nThe orbits have a sort of heart-shape, their apices being turned\r\nforwards, and their more convex sides inwards.\r\n\r\nThe supra-temporal fossæ are half-moon-shaped, their straight sides\r\nbeing external and so inclined that, if prolonged, they would decussate\r\nupon a line joining the anterior margins of the orbits.\r\n\r\nOn the palatine surface of the skull, the premaxillo-maxillary suture\r\nruns backwards from the canine groove, as far as the level of the middle\r\nof the second alveolus behind the groove (or that of the seventh tooth),\r\nwhich point it reaches at about the junction of the middle with the\r\ninner third of the palatine plate of the maxilla. The suture then turns\r\nabruptly forwards until it reaches the level of the anterior margin of\r\nthe alveolus of the sixth tooth, when it bends suddenly inwards to meet\r\nits fellow. The whole suture, therefore, has the form of a W. The vomers\r\nare completely hidden.\r\n\r\nThe posterior nares look downwards and backwards; their aperture is,\r\nfrom the incompleteness of the septum, single, and has a transversely\r\nelongated crescentic form. It measures 1-1/8 inch in width by\r\n3/8ths antero-posteriorly. The basi-sphenoid is seen for about\r\n1/8th of an inch on the base of the skull behind it, bounding the\r\nsides of the eustachian tube. The dental formula is 18-18/15-15.\r\nThe fourth and tenth teeth are largest in the upper jaw, the first and\r\nfourth in the lower. The eight posterior teeth on each side in the upper\r\njaw, and the five posterior in the lower, have a marked constriction\r\nbetween the short crown and the fang of the tooth. There are deep\r\ninterdental pits for the reception of the mandibular teeth between the\r\nthird and fourth, and fourth and fifth teeth above, and between the\r\nsucceeding teeth from the sixth to the thirteenth.\r\n\r\nThe hyoidean cornua are very strong curved bones, the chord of whose arc\r\nmeasures 3-1/2 inches. They are concave inwards, convex outwards,\r\nconcave posteriorly, convex anteriorly; they are flattened from side to\r\nside below, but they end above in subcylindrical styloid extremities.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth vertebra the neurocentral suture passes just above the\r\nbase of the parapophysis; it traverses the parapophysis in the tenth\r\nand eleventh vertebræ, while in the twelfth the parapophysis suddenly\r\nrises to the root of the diapophysis, and the suture lies far below\r\nit. The centra of the dorsal vertebræ, as far as the thirteenth\r\ninclusive, have hypapophyses. The diapophyses of the ninth vertebra pass\r\nalmost horizontally outwards, but are a good deal inclined backwards.\r\nIn the succeeding vertebræ up to the fourteenth or fifteenth, the\r\ndiapophyses are, in addition, inclined upwards, the upward inclination\r\nbeing most marked in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth vertebræ. From\r\nthe fifteenth vertebra onwards, the transverse processes pass almost\r\ndirectly outwards, without either upward or backward inclination. The\r\nspan of the transverse processes is greatest in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth vertebræ, in which the distance between the extremities of\r\nthese processes is 7-1/4 inches, a length about equal to that of the\r\nlongest vertebral rib.\r\n\r\nThe rib of the ninth vertebra is terminated by a single long and slender\r\nsemicartilaginous process which does not unite with the sternum.\r\nEach of the vertebral ribs from the tenth to the seventeenth vertebræ\r\ninclusively, on the other hand, is united with the sternum, or its\r\ncontinuation, by two such semicartilaginous costal elements, which\r\nmay be respectively termed sternal and lateral. The sternal elements\r\nof the ribs of the tenth and eleventh vertebræ are united with the\r\nsternum proper; those of the next five vertebræ are connected with its\r\nmedian backward prolongation, while those of the seventeenth vertebra\r\nare attached to the processes into which this prolongation divides\r\nposteriorly.\r\n\r\nThe sternal costal elements are very broad and flat, and though the\r\nlateral ones are less so, they are wide and expanded. The lateral costal\r\npieces of the eleventh to the sixteenth vertebræ inclusively, give\r\nattachment to very large and flat, triangular, _processus uncinati_.\r\nThose of the twelfth are 3-3/4 inches long and 1-3/8 inch wide at\r\ntheir widest part. The transverse processes of the twentieth vertebra\r\nbear rudimentary ribs. The centrum of the thirteenth vertebra is\r\n1-3/4 inch long, and the vertebra is 3-3/4 inches high from the\r\nlower edge of the centrum to the summit of the neural spine. The centra\r\nof the vertebræ retain nearly the same length to the twentieth caudal;\r\nbut behind this vertebra they are shorter, as are the anterior dorsal\r\nvertebræ. The first caudal vertebra is provided with two styliform\r\nbones, which represent the chevron bones of the other caudal vertebræ,\r\nbut are not united below.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal scutes have the arrangement which his often been described.\r\nThey are separated (except perhaps the median rows) by integumentary\r\nspaces, neither overlapping nor uniting by sutures; and there are no\r\nventral scutes.\r\n\r\nAmong the osteological characters which have been detailed, the\r\npeculiarities of the tergal armour, the proportions of the skull,\r\ncombined with the characters of the ridges upon its surface, and the\r\nform of the premaxillo-maxillary suture amply suffice to diagnose this\r\nspecies. Even in the small skull, only 5-1/2 inches long, lent to\r\nme by Dr. Gray, the characteristic features of the species are well\r\nexhibited, although age appears to give rise to many differences. Thus\r\nthe posterior margin of the external nostrils does not extend so far\r\nback as in the adult, and the facial is smaller in proportion to the\r\nsyncipital region, whose anterior and posterior transverse dimensions\r\nare very nearly equal. The orbits are proportionally larger, the\r\ninterorbital space more excavated; and the outer straight margins of\r\nthe supra-temporal fossæ are parallel with the longitudinal axis of the\r\nskull. Still more important differences are visible on the palatine\r\nface of the skull. The premaxillo-maxillary suture reaches back, indeed,\r\nto the line of the seventh tooth; but it forms an even curve whose\r\nsummit is in the middle line. The aperture of the posterior nares,\r\nagain, has a totally different form from that which it assumes in the\r\nadult. It is somewhat heart-shaped, with its apex forwards, measures\r\n1/4 inch long by 3/16ths at broadest, and looks altogether\r\ndownwards, while its anterior margin is situated far more forward in the\r\npalate than that of the adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Crocodilus biporcatus._\r\n\r\nThis, the best-known Crocodile, is a very well-marked species,\r\ncharacterized (beside the peculiarities of its dermal armour) by a\r\ncomparatively slender skull, similar in shape to that of _C. vulgaris_,\r\nand, like it, without any sudden enlargement immediately behind the\r\ncanine groove; and by the strong ridge which arises on each lachrymal\r\nbone close to the anterior edge of the orbit, and is continued forwards\r\non to the line of junction of the nasal and maxillary bones, so that\r\nthe naso-maxillary suture traverses the axis of the ridge, and then\r\nCURVES outwards, descending towards the alveolus of the tenth tooth.\r\nThe premaxillo-maxillary suture is W-shaped; and its salient angles\r\nreach backwards even to the level of the posterior margin of the\r\nseventh alveolus.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Crocodilus Americanus_ (_acutus_, Cuv.)\r\n\r\nhas the slenderness of snout (even more marked) and the form of the\r\npremaxillo-maxillary suture of the preceding species; but it is at once\r\ndistinguished from this and all other Crocodiles (except _C. rhombifer_)\r\nby the marked longitudinal and transverse convexity of the middle of the\r\nface, which gives the profile a totally different aspect from that of\r\nthe other species, which are flat or concave in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Crocodilus Journei_\r\n\r\nis another unmistakeably distinct and very remarkable species. The\r\ndescriptions and figures given by Graves, Bory de St. Vincent, and\r\nDuméril and Bibron, of the unique specimen of this Crocodile to the\r\nBordeaux Museum, would alone have compelled me to differ entirely from\r\nthe view taken by Dr. Gray of the affinities of this species. These\r\nobservers agree in stating that _Crocodilus Journei_ has six cervical\r\nscutes, arranged as in the other Crocodiles, and, as Graves says,\r\n\"separated by an interval of four inches\" from the commencement of the\r\ntergal scutes, whence it is obviously impossible that it can be a\r\n_Mecistops_. But, in addition to this, I had the good fortune to find,\r\namong the recent additions to that excellent osteological collection\r\nwhich Dr. Gray has gradually formed at the British Museum, the skull of\r\na Crocodile obtained from a dealer in Paris, and labelled by him \"Croc.\r\nde l'Orinoke.\" I at first imagined this Crocodile to be a _Mecistops_;\r\nbut on careful investigation it turned out to be no other than the skull\r\nof a _Crocodilus Journei_, somewhat larger than the Bordeaux specimen,\r\nbut, as the subjoined measurements will prove, agreeing with it in all\r\nits proportions:--\r\n\r\n                                                             Inches.\r\n\r\n  Length from end of snout to end of ossa quadrata           22-1/2\r\n  Breadth between outer margins of ossa quadrata              9-3/4\r\n  ---- at the level of the anterior margins of the orbits     5-1/2\r\n  ---- at the tenth tooth                                     3-1/2\r\n  ---- at the end of the snout                                2-3/4\r\n  ---- of the interorbital space                              1-3/4\r\n  Length of mandibular symphysis                              5\r\n\r\nNow Duméril and Bibron expressly state that the length of the head of\r\n_C. Journei_ equals 2-1/2 times its greatest transverse diameter,\r\nthat the width of the jaws at the anterior margins of the orbit equals\r\none-fourth the length of the head, and that at the tenth tooth it equals\r\none-sixth the length of the head; and these are as nearly as possible,\r\nit will be observed, the relations of the same dimensions in the above\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nIn the specimen in the British Museum there are eighteen teeth on each\r\nside above, and fifteen below. The Bordeaux specimen is stated to have\r\nthe same dental formula, except that there are sixteen teeth in the left\r\nramus of the mandible. The fourth and tenth maxillary teeth are stated\r\nby Graves to be as large again as the others; and the corresponding\r\nalveoli have these proportions to one another in the British Museum\r\nspecimen. In fact, there can be no doubt that this skull is that of a\r\ntrue _Crocodilus Journei_.\r\n\r\nBut its general characters at once prove the close affinity of _C.\r\nJournei_ with the other true Crocodiles, from which it differs only in\r\nits elongated and gradually tapering skull, and in the more backward\r\nextension of the mandibular symphysis[4], which attains the level of the\r\nposterior margin of the sixth tooth.\r\n\r\nIn this character, and in the extreme slenderness of the snout, there\r\nis doubtless an approximation to _Mecistops_; but _Crocodilus Journei_\r\nis sharply separated from that genus by the characters of its teeth, and\r\nby those of its dermal armour.\r\n\r\n    [4] The greater proportional length of the symphysis is noted by\r\n    Duméril and Bibron.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Crocodilus bombifrons_ (_palustris?_).\r\n\r\nAll the species of _Crocodilus_ which I have hitherto mentioned have,\r\nin common, the backward curvature of the premaxillo-maxillary suture to\r\nthe level of the seventh tooth. But there is a species of Crocodile,\r\nabout whose proper specific name I am by no means clear, in which this\r\nsuture passes straight across the palate, or may even be a little convex\r\nforwards.\r\n\r\nAnd not only do the skulls of this species exhibit this approximation\r\nto those of the _Alligatoridæ_, but they resemble them still further in\r\ntheir rounded snouts, their great width immediately behind the canine\r\ngroove, and in the fact that, in young specimens, one or the other\r\ncanine may be received into a pit instead of into a groove[5].\r\n\r\nIn the Hunterian Collection there are seven skulls, varying in length\r\nfrom 5-1/4 inches up to 16 inches, in none of which does the crown of\r\nthe premaxillo-maxillary suture extend beyond a line joining the sixth\r\npair of teeth. In all there are two short ridges (convergent in young\r\nspecimens, nearly parallel in old ones) upon the lachrymal bones, which\r\nend before reaching the anterior limits of those bones. They all have\r\nan oblique ridge on the upper jaw above the tenth tooth; and the snout\r\nattains the width which it has opposite this tooth immediately behind\r\nthe canine groove. In the British Museum there are five middle-sized\r\nskulls with the same characters; but two of these have a pit on one\r\nside of the upper jaw, and a groove on the other, and one has something\r\nbetween a pit and a groove on each side.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray, has in his 'Catalogue[6],' mentioned the peculiar transverse\r\ndisposition of the premaxillo-maxillary suture in his _Crocodilus\r\nbombifrons_; and on examining the two crania thus named in the British\r\nMuseum collection, one of which is 20 and the other 21 inches long, I\r\ncan discover no distinguishing character between them and those already\r\ndescribed. There can be no doubt then, I think, that these constant\r\nand well-marked characters, exhibited by fourteen skulls which vary in\r\nlength from 5-1/4 to 21 inches, prove the existence of a distinct\r\nspecies of Crocodile, which I would provisionally term _bombifrons_.\r\n\r\n    [5] In a skull of this species 14-1/2 inches long, in the British\r\n    Museum, the vomers are completely excluded from the palate, and\r\n    their anterior ends do not extend for an eighth of an inch beyond\r\n    the palatine part of the palato-maxillary suture, which lies on a\r\n    level with the anterior margin of the twelfth alveolus. Each vomer\r\n    is 2-3/8 inches long, and presents the same general form as that\r\n    of _Jacare_; only the anterior division is but a very small, flat\r\n    and thin plate, not a quarter of an inch long. The boundary of the\r\n    median nares is formed in equal proportions by the vomer and the\r\n    palatine, and is opposite the fourteenth tooth. The hinder end of\r\n    the vomer articulates with the end of the descending process of\r\n    the prefrontal.\r\n\r\n    [6] 'Catalogue of the Tortoises, Crocodiles, and Amphisbænians in\r\n    the Collection of the British Museum,' 1844, p. 59.\r\n\r\nI believe that this species has been constantly confounded with\r\n_biporcatus_, from which it may be at once distinguished by the\r\ndirection of the premaxillo-maxillary suture, and by the shape of the\r\nsnout behind the canine groove. I have found these distinctions to hold\r\ngood at all ages; but the last-mentioned difference is far more marked\r\nin middle-aged than in either young or old specimens.\r\n\r\nAll the skulls named _Crocodilus palustris_ which I have seen are\r\nreferable either to _C. biporcatus_ or to _C. bombifrons_. With respect\r\nto the _C. palustris_ of Lesson and Duméril and Bibron, the latter\r\nauthors consider it to be only a variety of _C. vulgaris_. Their\r\ndescription would, however, apply very well to _C. bombifrons_, as I\r\nhave defined it above; and they expressly state ('Erp. Générale,' t.\r\niii. p. 113) that all their specimens (twelve in number and varying in\r\nlength from 30 centimetres to more than 3 metres) came from the East\r\nIndies or the Seychelle Islands. Now, Duméril and Bibron enumerate only\r\nthree Asiatic Crocodiles--_C. biporcatus_, _C. palustris_, and _C.\r\ngaleatus_, the last of which was only known to them by description; so\r\nthat all the numerous Asiatic crocodiles which passed through their\r\nhands belonged either to _C. biporcatus_ or _C. palustris_. On the other\r\nhand, all the skulls of crocodiles from Asia which I have met with\r\n(amounting to at least twenty) are either those of _C. biporcatus_ or\r\nof the species which I have called _bombifrons_; so that I suspect the\r\nlatter title will turn out to be a synonym of _palustris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Crocodilus rhombifer._\r\n\r\nI have not been able to obtain any skull of this species, which,\r\naccording to Cuvier's account and figures ('Oss. Fossiles,' t. ix. p.\r\n102), resembles _C. Americanus_ in the great convexity of its nasal\r\nregion, but differs from it in the greater breadth of the skull, and in\r\nthe strong converging preorbital ridges, which appear to be limited to\r\nthe lachrymal bones. If the figures are to be I trusted, however, there\r\nare other very important distinctive characters about the cranium of\r\nthis species; for Cuvier's, fig. 2, pl. 331, which gives a view of the\r\npalate, shows the premaxillo-maxillary suture forming a nearly straight\r\ntransverse line.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere remain several species of _Crocodilus_ whose skulls I have not\r\nbeen able to examine, and of which no sufficient descriptions exist. Of\r\nthese, (7.) _C. galeatus_ and (8.) _C. Gravesii_ (_planirostris_) would\r\nappear to be very distinct forms. (9.) _C. marginatus_ is considered by\r\nDuméril and Bibron to be only a variety of _C. vulgaris_; and they take\r\nthe same view of (10.) _Crocodilus suchus_. Professor Owen, however, has\r\nfigured the cranium of an Egyptian mummy under this name ('Monograph on\r\nthe Reptilia of the London Clay,' Pal. Soc., 1850). In the under-view\r\nof this skull (tab. i. fig. 2), the junction of the premaxilla and the\r\nmaxilla in the palate seems to be broken away; but on the left side, the\r\npalatine process of the maxilla is entire, as far as the level of the\r\nanterior margin of the sixth tooth, and there is not a trace of a suture\r\nbehind this point. Are there, then, two or more species of Crocodile in\r\nEgypt, as Geoffroy St.-Hilaire supposed?\r\n\r\nWith regard to the distribution of the species of _Crocodilus_, _C.\r\nvulgaris_, _C. marginatus_, and _C. suchus_(?) appear to be exclusively\r\nAfrican; all the crocodiles from other parts of the Eastern hemisphere,\r\nwhich I have met with, belong, as I have stated above, either to _C.\r\nbiporcatus_ or _C. bombifrons_, both of which species are found in\r\nthe Ganges. _Crocodilus galeatus_ appears to be peculiar to Siam.\r\n_Crocodilus Americanus_ and _C. rhombifer_ are undoubtedly American. _C.\r\nJournei_ has been supposed to be African; but such positive evidence as\r\nexists tends rather to prove it to be an American species. Thus Bory de\r\nSt. Vincent states that the Bordeaux specimen is \"suspected to have come\r\nfrom America;\" and, as I have said, the skull in the British Museum is\r\nlabelled \"from the Orinoko.\"\r\n\r\n_Crocodilus Gravesii_ (_planirostris_) is supposed by Bory de St.\r\nVincent to have been brought from the Congo; but its real origin is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 5. MECISTOPS.\r\n\r\nThe cranium is elongated, and the snout slender and Gavial-like. There\r\nare eighteen slender and subequal teeth above, and fifteen below, on\r\neach side. The mandibular symphysis extends back to the level of the\r\nseventh tooth. The cervical scutes are arranged in two transverse rows,\r\neach of which contains two scutes; and there is no space left between\r\nthe posterior row and the tergal series.\r\n\r\nThis excellent genus, as established by Dr. Gray, includes Cuvier's\r\n_Crocodilus cataphractus_ (which Dr. Gray considers to be the young of\r\na species whose full-grown form was discovered by Mr. Bennett in West\r\nAfrica), _Crocodilus Journei_ and _Crocodilus Schlegelii_. As I have\r\nendeavoured to show, however, _C. Journei_ is a true crocodile; and, as\r\nI shall point out below, Müller and Schlegel have satisfactorily proved\r\n_C. Schlegelii_ to be a Gavial. Consequently _Mecistops_ is at present\r\nrepresented by only one species, which must be called _M. cataphractus_\r\nif _M. Bennettii_ of Gray is really the adult of the form which Cuvier\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII. In the family of the GAVIALIDÆ, the snout is always very long and\r\nslender; the teeth are for the most part slender, sharp-edged, and\r\nsubequal. The two anterior mandibular teeth pass into grooves, one of\r\nwhich lies on each side of a beak-like prominence of the premaxillæ,\r\nwhich carries the two anterior upper teeth. The canines are received\r\ninto grooves. The mandibular symphysis extends back to at least the\r\nfourteenth tooth, and is partly formed by the junction of the splenial\r\nbones. The premaxillo-maxillary suture is always strongly convex\r\nbackwards. The posterior nares are situated more forward than in the\r\n_Crocodili_. The temporal fossæ are large. The feet are strongly webbed.\r\nThe dorsal scutes are not articulated; and there are no ventral scutes.\r\n\r\nI distinguish two genera in this family, _Rhynchosuchus_ and _Gavialis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 6. RHYNCHOSUCHUS.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty teeth above, and eighteen or nineteen below, on each\r\nside; the mandibular symphysis extends to the fifteenth tooth. The\r\nposterior teeth of the upper jaw, and almost all those of the lower jaw,\r\nare received into interdental pits; the orbital margins are not raised;\r\nand the premaxillæ are hardly at all expanded. The premaxillo-maxillary\r\nsuture does not reach the third tooth behind the notch.\r\n\r\nI propose the name _Rhynchosuchus_ to indicate that generic type which\r\nis at present represented by the solitary species called by Müller\r\nand Schlegel _Crocodilus_ (_Gavialis_) _Schlegelii_, and admirably\r\ndescribed and figured by them in their essay, 'Over de Krokodilen van\r\nder Indischen Archipel,' in the 'Verhandelingen over de natuurlijke\r\nGesch. der Nederl. overzee. Bezittingen,' 1839-1844. Under the title\r\n_Crocodilus_ (_Gavialis_) _Schlegelii_ (p. 18), they say--\"The Gavial\r\nfrom Borneo, when compared with the Indian one, is principally\r\ndistinguished by the following characters:--\r\n\r\n\"1. By its stronger form and better developed limbs.\r\n\r\n2. By its much less slender head and snout, which last does not narrow\r\nso suddenly in front of the eyes as in _G. Gangeticus_.\r\n\r\n3. By the smaller number of teeth, of which there are twenty above and\r\neighteen below on each side, while _G. Gangeticus_ has 28/26 or\r\n27/25; furthermore, the teeth are stouter, less curved, and less\r\nsharp, and are disposed more perpendicularly, and the ninth tooth of the\r\nupper jaw (reckoning from the front) is considerably larger and stronger\r\nthan the others; whence it follows that, just as in the true Crocodiles,\r\nthe snout at the level of this tooth exhibits a lateral projection.\r\n\r\n4. By the shorter symphysis of the under jaw.\r\n\r\n5. By the absence of the swollen nasal prominence (neusklep), which\r\ncharacterizes the Gangetic Gavial.\r\n\r\n6. By the less expanded form of the tabular upper surface of the hinder\r\npart of the skull.\r\n\r\n7. By the very slight production of the edges of the orbit.\r\n\r\n8. By the large eyes.\r\n\r\n9. By the presence of a number of small nuchal shields, while _G.\r\nGangeticus_ has but one pair.\r\n\r\n10. By the strongly developed keels of the dorsal scutes.\r\n\r\n11. By the much larger scales on the under parts and on the legs of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n12. By the different colours with which it is variegated.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese authors further point out that the vomers appear for a small space\r\nin the posterior part of the palate, that the opercular or splenial\r\nbones join in the symphysis of the lower jaw, and that the cervical and\r\ndorsal scutes form one continuous shield; and they represent the two\r\nanterior mandibular teeth passing in grooves on either side of the end\r\nof the premaxilla. In fact, they fully and completely establish the fact\r\nthat their new species belongs to the _Longirostres_ of Cuvier, or to\r\nthe Gavials of later writers.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is somewhat surprising to find the\r\ndeliberate conclusions of these careful investigators set aside in the\r\nfollowing brief passage:--\r\n\r\n    \"This Bornean species (_C. Schlegelii_) was, in fact, originally\r\n    described as a new species of Gavial; but the nasal bones, as in the\r\n    fossil from Sheppey, figured in t. ii. 15, extend to the hinder\r\n    border of the external nostril.\"--_Owen_, _Fossil Reptilia of the\r\n    London Clay, Crocodilia_, p. 15: 1850.\r\n\r\nMüller and Schlegel give remarkably clear and beautiful figures of the\r\nskull of their Gavial; and these show at once that the nasal bones do\r\nnot \"reach the hinder border of the external nostril,\" but meet the\r\npremaxillaries at a point very distant from that border, viz. opposite\r\nthe ninth tooth. Even did the nasal bones reach the posterior boundary\r\nof the nostril, such a character would not outweigh those derived from\r\nthe relations and number of the teeth, the structure and extent of the\r\nmandibular symphysis, and the disposition of the dermal scutes,--all of\r\nwhich are so clearly and definitely set forth by Müller and Schlegel,\r\nthat it seems difficult to understand how any one who had consulted the\r\noriginal memoir could have overlooked them.\r\n\r\nIt was possible, however, that Müller and Schlegel, notwithstanding\r\ntheir great opportunities, might have erred in their statements; and I\r\ntherefore gladly seized the opportunity of testing their description by\r\ncomparing it with an authentic skull of the species in question, from\r\nNew Guinea, in the collection of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nI have found the statement of Müller and Schlegel minutely accurate\r\nin almost all points; and there cannot be the slightest doubt, not\r\nonly that the Schlegelian crocodile is one of the _Gavialidæ_, but\r\nthat it forms a distinct generic type in that family, as different\r\nfrom _Gavialis_ as _Caiman_ is from _Jacare_, or _Mecistops_ from\r\n_Crocodilus_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following are the most important measurements of the skull of\r\n_Rhynchosuchus Schlegelii_ in the British Museum collection:--\r\n\r\n                                                       Inches.\r\n\r\n  Length from the end of the premaxilla to that of\r\n      os quadratum                                        23\r\n  Breadth from outer edge of one os quadratum to that\r\n      of the other                                         8-3/4\r\n  Breadth across the face in front of the orbits           4\r\n     \"    at the 9th tooth                                 2\r\n     \"    at the 5th tooth                                 1-1/2\r\n     \"    at the 3rd tooth                                 1-3/4\r\n     \"    of the beak-like curved process which carries\r\n      the two anterior teeth                               1\r\n  Mean width of lower jaw from symphysis to extremity      1-5/8\r\n  Length                                                  12\r\n  No tooth measures transversely more than                  3/16\r\n\r\nThe face is very smooth; but a slight longitudinal groove runs down on\r\neach side from the anterior margin of the orbit for about two inches.\r\nAnteriorly to this point the snout retains a nearly even diameter as\r\nfar as the ninth tooth, in front of which it suddenly narrows a little,\r\nretaining nearly the same dimensions to the fourth tooth, where it\r\nwidens a very little, and then suddenly narrows to the terminal beak.\r\nThe lower jaw does not expand at all at its extremity. The nasals join\r\nthe premaxillaries opposite the ninth tooth, and the splenial bones, in\r\nthe lower jaw, end opposite the tenth mandibular tooth, as the figures\r\nof Müller and Schlegel show. The vomers appear between the inner edges\r\nof the palatines posteriorly, as a thin bony band 1-3/8 inch long\r\nby 1/8 inch wide, which tapers at each end and is divided by a\r\nlongitudinal suture. The ninth tooth of the upper jaw is stronger than\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nThe only point in which the description of Müller and Schlegel seems\r\nto me to be incomplete[7] is with regard to the disposition of the\r\nteeth. They say--\"The teeth of _C. Schlegelii_, as regards their form\r\nand development, more nearly resemble those of the true Crocodiles;\r\nbut in the way in which the teeth of the two jaws are opposed, there\r\nis the most complete resemblance between our species and the Gangetic\r\nGavial,--both which species differ from all other crocodiles in the\r\ncircumstance that when the mouth is shut, all the teeth of the under jaw\r\nproject outside the lateral margin of the upper jaw\" (_l. c._ p. 22).\r\n\r\nWhat I find is this:--The anterior teeth of both the upper jaw and\r\nthe mandible are long, slender, sharp-edged, and slightly curved. The\r\nposterior eleven, on each side, in the upper jaw, are short, straight,\r\nconical, and constricted below their crowns. There are deep interdental\r\npits between the ten posterior mandibular teeth, into which the opposed\r\nteeth of the maxilla are received when the jaws are closed. All the\r\nmandibular teeth, except the two anterior and the fourth pair, pass into\r\nlike pits in the upper jaw. The anterior eight teeth on each side of\r\nthe upper jaw pass straight down outside the lower jaw. In the Gangetic\r\nGavial the relations of the teeth of the two jaws appear to me, as I\r\nshall state below, to be very different.\r\n\r\n_Rhynchosuchus Schlegelii_ inhabits the inland lakes of Borneo, and is\r\nfound in New Guinea.\r\n\r\n    [7] Or it is possible that the _Rhynchosuchus_ from New Guinea,\r\n    which I have examined, is specifically distinct from the Bornean\r\n    form.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 7. GAVIALIS.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-seven or twenty-eight teeth in the upper, and\r\ntwenty-five or twenty-six in the lower jaw. The mandibular symphysis\r\nextends to the twenty-third or twenty-fourth tooth. The lateral teeth\r\nof both jaws are, all but the very hindmost, directed obliquely\r\ndownwards (or upwards), forwards or outwards, and are not received\r\ninto interdental pits. The anterior margins of the orbits are raised.\r\nThe premaxillæ and the end of the mandible are greatly expanded. The\r\npremaxillo-maxillary suture reaches the level of the fourth tooth behind\r\nthe canine notch.\r\n\r\nThe only true _Gavialis_ is the well-known _G. Gangeticus_ from the\r\nEast Indies. In this 'Gavial,' or 'Garrhial,' the vomers are slender\r\nbones which do not extend further forwards than the level of the\r\ntwenty-second or twenty-first tooth, and have but a very short and\r\nslender representative of the anterior flattened division of the bone in\r\n_Jacare_; posteriorly they extend back to the level of the descending\r\nprocesses of the prefrontals. In a skull 25 inches long the vomers\r\nhave a length of about 4 inches, extending as they do a little further\r\nforward than the palato-maxillary suture. The median nares are opposite\r\nthe twenty-fifth tooth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll the _Crocodilia_ which I have enumerated are provided with two\r\nperfectly distinct kinds of dermal armour,--the one consisting of\r\nplates of horn, produced by a modification of the superficial layer of\r\nthe epidermis; the other composed of discs of bone marked by a peculiar\r\npitted sculpture on their outer surfaces, and developed within the\r\nsubstance of the dermis. To the former I shall apply the term \"scales;\"\r\nthe latter are what I have denominated \"scutes.\"\r\n\r\nAll recent _Crocodilia_ have both scales and scutes in the dorsal\r\nregion of the body, the scutes underlying, and having the same general\r\nform as the scales. In all, the ventral region of the body is also\r\ncovered with scales which have a very definite shape; but in no recent\r\nCrocodilian which I have examined, save those species which are\r\nincluded in the genera _Caiman_ and _Jacare_, are there any scutes in\r\nthe ventral region.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the genera _Alligator_, _Crocodilus_, _Mecistops_,\r\nRhynchosuchus, and _Gavialis_, the edges of the scutes, except those of\r\nthe two median longitudinal rows, are hardly ever united by sutures,\r\nnor do the posterior margins of those in each transverse row overlap the\r\nanterior margins of the succeeding row. At any rate, there is no flat,\r\nbevelled, articular facet on the outer surface of the anterior margin of\r\na scute, for articulation with the inner surface of the posterior margin\r\nof its predecessor. In the genera _Caiman_ and _Jacare_, however, the\r\nlateral edges of all the scutes of the dorsal and ventral shields are\r\nunited by serrated sutures; and the anterior end of the outer face of\r\neach is provided with a well-marked smooth facet, which is overlapped by\r\nthe smooth under-surface of the scute in front of it.\r\n\r\nI first noticed the remarkable structure of the dermal armour of these\r\n_Alligatoridæ_ in the skin of a _Jacare_ (_sp. incerta_), wanting the\r\nend of the tail, but which must have belonged to an animal between five\r\nand six feet in length. It had long been in my possession; but I had\r\nnever before had occasion to study its characters minutely.\r\n\r\nThe horny scales, which had the appearance of thin tortoise-shell,\r\ncould be readily peeled off (especially by the aid of a little caustic\r\npotash); and then the white surface of the subjacent bony scute upon\r\nwhich they were modelled came into view. It is to be understood,\r\nhowever, that the inner surface of the scale corresponded only in its\r\ngeneral form with the outer surface of the scute; for it did not dip\r\ninto the pits with which the latter is sculptured. These are in fact\r\nfilled by the dry dermis which extends over and encloses the scute, a\r\nvery thin layer (bearing the rete mucosum) being interposed between it\r\nand the scale; so that the pitted sculpture does not come out well until\r\nthe scutes have been boiled.\r\n\r\nThe _dorsal_ scutes are both carinated and angulated. By the application\r\nof the former term, I mean to indicate that, along a median or submedian\r\nlongitudinal line, their substance is more or less elevated, so as, in\r\nmany cases, to form a very prominent crest. This crest always subsides\r\nbefore it reaches the anterior margin of the scute, though it may extend\r\nbeyond the posterior margin. Its highest point is always behind the\r\ncentre of the scute, and is devoid of sculpture. The sculpture however\r\nseems to radiate from this point, inasmuch as it consists, on the\r\ngreater part of the scute, of distinct pits, which are usually round\r\ntowards the centre, but towards the periphery become ovals with their\r\nlong axes directed towards the point in question.\r\n\r\nThe smooth inner surfaces of the scute shelve towards a depression\r\nwhich corresponds with the external ridge, under which the sides of\r\nthe scute seem to meet in an angle. This may be called the 'angulation'\r\nof the scute. From before backwards, the inner surface of the scute is\r\na little convex. The scute is thickest in the middle; posteriorly, it\r\nthins off to an edge and overlaps its successor; anteriorly, its outer\r\nsurface is bevelled off at an acute angle with the inner, so as to give\r\nrise to a smooth shelving surface--wide from side to side, narrow from\r\nbefore backwards--forming the 'articular facet,' which is overlapped by\r\nthe inner surface of the posterior edge of the preceding scute. I have\r\ntermed this the 'articular facet;' but it must not be supposed that\r\nthere is anything like a true joint between the opposed facets of the\r\noverlapping and overlapped scutes; on the contrary, they are at once\r\nseparated and connected by the dermal connective tissue.\r\n\r\nThe posterior margin of the articular facet is separated by a deep\r\ntransverse groove, divided by little partitions into as many pits,\r\nfrom the rest of the sculptured surface; but there is no trace of any\r\nsuture dividing the scute into two portions. The lateral margins of each\r\nscute are united by serrated sutural edges with those which lie next to\r\nthem in the same transverse row; so that each row forms a nearly solid\r\nflat bony bar, composed, in the middle of the back, of as many as ten\r\ndistinct scutes. The outer edges of the outermost scutes only, thin off\r\nand exhibit no sutural serration, inasmuch as they are not directly\r\nconnected with ANY other scutes.\r\n\r\nThe median line of the back corresponds in general with the suture\r\nbetween the two middle scutes of each transverse row; so that the scutes\r\nare disposed symmetrically on either side of that line. Furthermore,\r\nthe anterior part of the inner surface of each of the two middle scutes\r\nis connected by ligament with the extremity of the spinous process of a\r\nvertebra; at least, this is the case in the dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and\r\nanterior caudal regions.\r\n\r\nThe scutes which protect the _ventral_ side of the body, from the\r\nthroat backwards, are four-sided and similar in their ornamentation\r\nto the dorsal scutes; but they exhibit neither ridge nor angulation,\r\ntheir outer and inner surfaces being parallel, and either nearly flat\r\nor evenly curved. Each forms, in fact, a segment of a large cylinder,\r\ninasmuch as the whole ventral shield is convex transversely, being\r\nnearly flat in the middle and much bent up at the sides. The dorsal\r\nshield, taken as a whole, is, on the contrary, nearly flat. The lateral\r\nedges of the ventral scutes interlock suturally; and their anterior and\r\nposterior edges are overlapped and overlap, just like the dorsal scutes.\r\nThe outer edges of the outermost ventral scutes thin off and are not\r\nunited with any bony element; and the ventral, like the dorsal scutes,\r\nare usually arranged symmetrically on either side of the median sutural\r\nline. There may be as many as twenty-two scutes united by their lateral\r\nsutures into a single strong, curved, transverse, bony, bar-like segment\r\nof the ventral armour.\r\n\r\nThroughout the neck and body, and as far as the commencement of the\r\ntail, the ends of the dorsal and ventral bony bars, whose sum may be\r\nregarded as a dorsal and a ventral shield respectively, are separated\r\nby an interval of integument, in which only small scattered scutes are\r\nvisible. The physiological import of this arrangement becomes obvious\r\nwhen we consider in what manner the animal breathes; and indeed the\r\nintegumentary interval answers very precisely to the leather which\r\nconnects the two boards of a bellows. Again, though the limbs are\r\nthemselves covered with articulated scutes, they are afforded free\r\nplay upon the body by this flexible interspace. Immediately behind the\r\nhind legs, the ventral and dorsal shields unite; and the tail is from\r\nthat point surrounded by a succession of bony hoops, each of which\r\ncorresponds with a vertebra, the segments of the exoskeleton answering\r\nto those of the endoskeleton.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature about the ventral scutes, however, and that\r\nin which they differ most widely from the dorsal ones, consists in the\r\nfact that each scute is composed of two distinct pieces, an anterior\r\nand a posterior, which unite together by a transverse serrated suture.\r\nThe anterior piece or 'semi-scute' may attain to three-quarters the\r\nlength of the posterior, and it has exactly the same width. The anterior\r\nsemi-scute bears the articular facet and the transverse pitted groove,\r\nwhose posterior wall is just in front of its hinder edge, or in other\r\nwords, of the suture, when the two semi-scutes are united.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general characters and mode of arrangement of the dorsal\r\nand ventral armour of _Jacare_. But there remain many noteworthy\r\npeculiarities in the disposition and number of the components of each\r\nband of the armour.\r\n\r\nThus, in the _dorsal shield_ there are two rows of nuchal scutes, each\r\ncontaining eight separate keeled bony plates; and of cervical scutes\r\nthere are five rows, the two anterior of which contain four angulated\r\nand carinated scutes each, while the three posterior contain only two\r\nscutes each. All these scutes, except the anterior row, have articular\r\nfacets; and all those of each row are united suturally. Of dorsal scutes\r\nthere are thirty transverse rows up to the median keel of the tail,\r\nwhich commences with the thirty-first row. The number of scutes in each\r\nrow is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Rows.                         Scutes.\r\n  1, 2, 3, 4                        6\r\n  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11            10\r\n  12, 13                            8\r\n  14, 15                            6\r\n  16, 17, 18                        4\r\n  19                                6\r\n  20                                8\r\n  23, 24                            6\r\n  25, 26                            5\r\n  27, 28                            4\r\n  29, 30                            4\r\n\r\n  31, 32, 33, 34                    5\r\n  The rest of the tail is wanting.\r\n\r\nThroughout the dorso-lumbar and sacral regions (_i. e._ up to the\r\nnineteenth row), the median scutes are hardly keeled at all, while the\r\nouter ones are the more strongly carinate the more external they lie.\r\n\r\nIn the caudal region, the second scute from the middle line, in the\r\ntwenty-third row, has a strong keel and angulation, which grows stronger\r\nin the corresponding scutes up to the thirtieth inclusive, until the\r\nsuperior and lateral faces of these scutes, in the twenty-ninth and\r\nthirtieth rows, are inclined to one another at a right angle and\r\nvery strongly keeled. I have said that, as a rule, the median line\r\nis occupied by a suture between two median scutes; but in the caudal\r\nregion[8], in the twenty-fifth row (which corresponds with the sixth\r\ncaudal vertebra) the two median scutes are replaced by one flat scute,\r\nso that there is no suture in the middle line. In the twenty-sixth row\r\nthere is a similar arrangement, but the flat scute is smaller; and in\r\nthe twenty-seventh no trace of it is left, so that the strongly keeled\r\nlateral scutes meet in the middle line, which is again occupied by a\r\nsuture. This continues up to the thirty-first row, when the median scute\r\nreappears as a thin vertical plate, broader below and in front, where it\r\narticulates with the median lateral scutes, than above and behind, where\r\nit exhibits a free edge only covered by the horny epidermis. It is thus\r\nthat the serrated dorsal crest of the tail is formed. The scutes of the\r\ncrest exhibit only very small round and distant pits.\r\n\r\nThe _ventral shield_ begins in the neck just behind the level of the\r\nanterior margins of the orbits: the fifteen anterior rows may be termed\r\nsubcervical, as they lie in front of the thorax. In the first six rows\r\nthe scutes are very small, and increase in number up to twelve in a row.\r\nIn the next six rows there are ten scutes in a row, and in the last\r\nthree, twelve. All these rows are symmetrically divided by the median\r\nline. In the three hinder rows the inner scutes are longer than the\r\nouter ones; and this is most markedly the case in the fifteenth row,\r\nwhose innermost scute is half as long again as the corresponding one of\r\nthe preceding row, and more than three times as long as the outermost of\r\nits own row.\r\n\r\n    [8] The second and third cervical rows in _Caiman palpebrosus_ and\r\n    _trigonatus_ also contain a median scute, and consequently an odd\r\n    number of scutes. In _Caiman trigonatus_, the third to the ninth\r\n    supra-caudal rows have each a median single scute.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth row differs from its predecessors and successors, and may\r\nbe termed the axillary row. It is bent upon itself with an angle open\r\nforwards, and is divided into two halves (each of which contains seven\r\nscutes) by the union of the middle scutes of the fifteenth subcervical\r\nwith those of the first row of what may be termed the subdorsal scutes,\r\nor those which lie under the thorax and abdomen. Of subdorsal and\r\nsubcaudal scutes there are, up to the broken-off end of the tail,\r\nthirty-seven rows, with the following numbers of scutes:--\r\n\r\n  Rows.           Scutes.\r\n\r\n   1                12\r\n   2                10\r\n   3, 4, 5,         12\r\n   6, 7, 8, 9,      14\r\n  10                16\r\n  11                14\r\n  12-17             14\r\n  18-20             12\r\n  21                14\r\n  22                18\r\n  23                22\r\n  24                22\r\n  25                20\r\n  26-28             18\r\n  29-31             16\r\n  32-34             14\r\n  35                12\r\n  36, 37            10\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that there are three more rows of ventral than of\r\ndorsal scutes. On endeavouring to ascertain how this came about, I\r\nobserved that the first subdorsal was a good deal behind the first\r\ndorsal row, though the eighth to the twelfth dorsal corresponded exactly\r\nwith the eighth to the twelfth ventral rows. In the anterior part of the\r\nbody, therefore, there is a clear general correspondence between the\r\nsegments of the dorsal and those of the ventral armour.\r\n\r\nIn the caudal region, again, I found that the twenty-fourth ventral\r\nrow, which is the first of the caudal rows not excavated by the vent,\r\ncorresponded exactly with the twenty-first dorsal row. It was clear,\r\ntherefore, that three ventral rows wore interpolated somewhere between\r\nthe twelfth and twenty-first dorsal rows; and on close examination I\r\nfound this interpolation to arise from the doubling of the fourteenth,\r\nfifteenth, and sixteenth ventral rows.\r\n\r\nI have examined _Jacare fissipes_ and _nigra_, _Caiman trigonatus_,\r\nand _C. gibbiceps_, in the British Museum; and I find, in all, dorsal\r\nand ventral armour having the same essential arrangement as that just\r\ndescribed. A specimen of _Caiman palpebrosus_ about two feet long, the\r\nopportunity of examining which I owe to Dr. Grant, exhibits the dorsal\r\nand ventral shields (whose scutes are in the main similarly arranged)\r\nvery beautifully; and a young _Jacare_ of about 18 inches in length,\r\nfor which I am indebted to the kindness of the same gentleman, proves\r\nthat the scutes are developed even in specimens of this age. I have\r\nno hesitation therefore in expressing my belief that this singularly\r\ncomplete dermal armour will be found to be characteristic of all the\r\nspecies of the genera _Caiman_ and _Jacare_. On the other hand, I\r\nhave examined _Alligator Mississipiensis_, _Crocodilus vulgaris_, _C.\r\nbiporcatus_, _C. Americanus_, _C. rhombifer_, and _C. bombifrons_,\r\n_Mecistops cataphractus_, and _Gavialis Gangeticus_, of various ages and\r\nsizes, without having been able to discover a trace of ventral scutes.\r\nThis is the more remarkable, as the well-marked ventral and dorsal\r\nshields of many of the ancient _Teleosauria_ would lead one to expect\r\na corresponding exoskeleton (if anywhere) in their nearest allies, the\r\nmodern _Gavialidæ_. However, _Goniopholis_, with its strong armour, is\r\nmore like an ordinary Crocodile; and I have recently discovered that a\r\ntrue Crocodile in some respects curiously similar to _C. bombifrons_\r\n(_C. Hastingsiæ_) was covered with scutes exceedingly like those of the\r\nmodern _Caiman_ and _Jacare_.\r\n\r\nIn minute structure the bony scutes of _Jacare_ closely resemble those\r\nof such a fish as a Sturgeon: a middle layer, containing so many canals\r\nas to appear almost cancellated in longitudinal or transverse section,\r\nis covered externally by a thin, and internally by a thick, layer\r\ncomposed of bony lamellæ, nearly parallel to the plane of the scute.\r\nRound the canals of the middle layer, the bony lamellæ are disposed\r\nconcentrically, to a greater or less extent. The lacunæ are of very\r\nvarious shapes; and there are perhaps as many short as elongated forms.\r\nThe canals of the middle layer communicate by large branches with the\r\ninner, by smaller and fewer branches with the outer surface of the\r\nscute.\r\n\r\nIn the young _Jacare_ mentioned above, I found the dermis to be\r\ndistinguishable into two layers. The more superficial of these is thin,\r\nmade up of irregular or formless connective tissue, and contains many\r\nramified pigment-masses. Its smooth outer surface underlies the rete\r\nmucosum. Internally, it passes into the second or deep layer, which\r\nconsists of successive layers of distinctly fibrous connective tissue,\r\ndisposed in definite parallel bundles, and having a very regular\r\narrangement. Throughout a space corresponding with the area of each\r\nscale, in fact, the bundles of each layer cross those of the succeeding\r\nlayer at right angles; and the successive tiers of bundles are tied\r\ntogether by short cords disposed perpendicularly to the planes of the\r\ntiers. A corresponding arrangement of the bundles of connective tissue\r\nhas long been known to obtain in the dermis of Fishes and _Batrachia_.\r\nAt each end of this small \"mat\" of connective tissue, the bundles, if\r\nI may so say, fray out; and at the anterior end, the layers, loosened\r\nin texture, bend upwards, spreading out at the same time to become\r\ncontinuous with the fibres of the \"mat\" in front. In consequence of\r\nthe matting under the quadrate surface of each scale, the dermis has a\r\npeculiar facetted aspect, quite apart from any osseous deposit. Where\r\nbony scutes are formed, they appear as very thin perforated plates in\r\nthe most superficial portion of the deep layer of the dermis; so that\r\nthere is a single thin layer of dense connective tissue above them,\r\nwhile below them are all the rest of the denser and deeper lamellæ of\r\nthe dermis. Through the apertures in this primitive osseous plate (the\r\nrudiment of the middle layer of the future scute), bundles of connective\r\ntissue extend, connecting the deep with the superjacent lamellæ.\r\n\r\nIf a thin section is made and decalcified with weak acid under the\r\nmicroscope, the calcareous matter, as it is dissolved away, leaves an\r\nobscurely fibrous matrix of a different aspect from the surrounding\r\nconnective tissue, and the endoplasts, or nuclei, of this matrix are\r\nseen each to have occupied the centre of a lacuna.\r\n\r\nAgain, the rudimentary scute lies in the dermis as in a sort of pocket,\r\nthe superficial and deep walls of which separate from it with great\r\nease; and in good thin sections made through the dermis and scute, there\r\nseems to be no direct connexion between the substance of the scute above\r\nand below, and the connective tissue with which it is in contact. Nor\r\ncould I satisfy myself that the margins of the scute were continuous\r\nwith the surrounding bundles of connective tissue. However, the specimen\r\nhad been a very long time in spirit; and I am unwilling to lay too much\r\nstress upon these observations, which tend to negative the supposition\r\nthat the scute proceeds from the direct calcification of the connective\r\ntissue of the dermis.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I must remark that horizontal sections of the scutes\r\nhave presented oblique parallel fissures, sometimes crossing one\r\nanother, which might readily be supposed to correspond with the lines of\r\nseparation of ossified bundles of connective tissue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.--During a recent visit to Paris, my friend Mr. Busk was kind\r\nenough to examine the specimens of recent _Crocodilia_ in the Museum\r\nof the Jardin des Plantes, with reference to certain points to which\r\nI requested his attention. Mr. Busk informs me that there is no doubt\r\nabout the transverse direction of the premaxillo-maxillary suture in\r\n_Crocodilus rhombifer_; and his statements lead me to entertain no\r\nquestion that _C. bombifrons_ is a synonym of _C. palustris_.\r\n\r\nIn the typical specimens of _C. marginatus_ and _C. suchus_ of Geoffroy\r\nSt.-Hilaire, the premaxillo-maxillary suture extends back to the level\r\nof the seventh tooth.\r\n\r\nMr. Busk has furthermore pointed out to me the existence of another\r\nAmerican species of Crocodile--_C. Morelettii_, which has been described\r\nby M. Auguste Duméril in his \"Description des Reptiles nouveaux ou\r\nimparfaitement connus,\" &c., 'Archives du Muséum,' t. vi. 1852.\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits lake Flores, in Yucatan; and it is said by M.\r\nDuméril to approach _C. Americanus_, from which it differs in the\r\nproportions of the skull and in the characters of the dermal armour.\r\n\r\n    June 21st, 1859.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Habits of the \"Aye-Aye\" (_Cheiromys madagascariensis_, L.,\r\nCuv.).

Communicated by Prof. OWEN, F.R.S., V.P.L.S.\r\n\r\n    [Read April 7th, 1859.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Mauritius, Jan. 27, 1859.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR MR. OWEN,--After very great difficulty and much delay, I have\r\nat length obtained a fine healthy male adult _Aye-Aye_; and he is now\r\nenjoying himself in a large cage which I have had constructed for him.\r\n\r\nHe is a most interesting little animal; and from close observation I\r\nhave learnt his habits very correctly. On receiving him from Madagascar,\r\nI was told that he ate bananas; so of course I fed him on them, but\r\ntried him with other fruit. I found he liked dates,--which was a grand\r\ndiscovery, supposing he be sent alive to England. Still I thought that\r\nthose strong rodent teeth, as large as those of a young Beaver, must\r\nhave been intended for some other purpose than that of trying to eat\r\nhis way out of a cage--the only use he seemed to make of them, besides\r\nmasticating soft fruits. Moreover, he had other peculiarities,--_e.g._,\r\nsingularly large, naked ears directed forward, as if for offensive\r\nrather than defensive purposes; then, again, the second finger of\r\nthe hands is unlike anything but a monster supernumerary member, it\r\nbeing slender and long, half the thickness of the other fingers, and\r\nresembling a piece of bent wire. Excepting the head and this finger, he\r\nclosely resembles a Lemur.\r\n\r\nNow as he attacked, every night, the woodwork of his cage, which I was\r\ngradually lining with tin, I bethought myself of tying some sticks over\r\nthe woodwork, so that he might gnaw these instead. I had previously\r\nput in some large branches for him to climb upon; but the others were\r\nstraight sticks to cover over the woodwork of his cage, which _alone_ he\r\nattacked. It so happened that the thick sticks I now put into his cage\r\nwere bored in all directions by a large and destructive grub called here\r\nthe _Moutouk_. Just at sunset the Aye-Aye crept from under his blanket,\r\nyawned, stretched, and betook himself to his tree, where his movements\r\nare lively and graceful, though by no means so quick as those of a\r\nsquirrel. Presently he came to one of the worm-eaten branches, which he\r\nbegan to examine most attentively; and bending forward his ears, and\r\napplying his nose close to the bark, he rapidly tapped the surface with\r\nthe curious second digit, as a woodpecker taps a tree, though with much\r\nless noise, from time to time inserting the end of the slender finger\r\ninto the worm-holes, as a surgeon would a probe. At length he came to\r\na part of the branch which evidently gave out an interesting sound,\r\nfor he began to tear it with his strong teeth. He rapidly stripped off\r\nthe bark, cut into the wood, and exposed the nest of a grub, which he\r\ndaintily picked out of its bed with the slender tapping finger, and\r\nconveyed the luscious morsel to his mouth.\r\n\r\nI watched these proceedings with intense interest, and was much struck\r\nwith the marvellous adaptation of the creature to its habits, shown by\r\nhis acute hearing, which enables him aptly to distinguish the different\r\ntones emitted from the wood by his gentle tapping; his evidently acute\r\nsense of smell, aiding him in his search; his secure footsteps on the\r\nslender branches, to which he firmly clung by his quadrumanous members;\r\nhis strong rodent teeth, enabling him to tear through the wood; and\r\nlastly by the curious slender finger, unlike that of any other animal,\r\nand which he used alternately as a pleximeter, a probe, and a scoop.\r\n\r\nBut I was yet to learn another peculiarity. I gave him water to drink\r\nin a saucer, on which he stretched out a hand, dipped a finger into it,\r\nand drew it obliquely through his open mouth; and this he repeated so\r\nrapidly, that the water seemed to flow into his mouth. After a while he\r\nlapped like a cat; but his first mode of drinking appeared to me to be\r\nhis way of reaching water in the deep clefts of trees.\r\n\r\nI am told that the _Aye-Aye_ is an object of veneration at Madagascar,\r\nand that if any native touches one, he is sure to die within the year;\r\nhence the difficulty of obtaining a specimen. I overcame this scruple by\r\na reward of £10.\r\n\r\nI quite despair of obtaining the bones of the _Dinornis_ or _Dodo_,\r\nthough I have made every effort. I shall always be proud to be of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\n  H. SANDWITH.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Moulting of the common Lobster (_Homarus vulgaris_) and Shore\r\nCrab (_Carcinus mænas_). By S. JAMES A. SALTER, M.B., F.L.S., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n[Read April 7th, 1859.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI am induced to bring this subject before the Linnean Society, on\r\naccount of the singularly perfect specimen of the thrown-off slough of\r\na Lobster which I have now an opportunity of exhibiting, and because\r\nthe process by which it was shed was witnessed and carefully watched by\r\ntwo competent observers--by my friend Mr. Robert Cooke, of Scarborough,\r\na Fellow of this Society, and by the intelligent wife of the Curator\r\nof the Scarborough Museum, in an aquarium in which institution the\r\noccurrence took place.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which certain of the Decapod Crustaceans cast their old\r\nshells in the process of renewal and growth have already been made the\r\nsubject of observation and record.\r\n\r\nRéaumur, as early as 1712, and again in 1718, saw and described the\r\nsloughing of the common freshwater Crayfish (_Astacus fluviatilis_).\r\n\r\nIt was witnessed in the common edible Crab (_Cancer Pagurus_) by Mr.\r\nCouch, in 1833.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the moulting-process was observed by Mr. Gosse, in the\r\nSpinous Spider-crab (_Maia Squinado_).\r\n\r\nBeyond these three recorded examples, I believe that the actual\r\noperation of moulting in Decapods has never been seen, though the\r\nsloughs of our common Crustacea, and the animals themselves but recently\r\nemerged from their old shells, are familiar to all marine zoologists.\r\n\r\nThere is no recorded account of the moulting of the Lobster, that I have\r\nbeen able to discover.\r\n\r\nThe Lobster from which the slough was obtained, and whose operations\r\nare the subject of this communication, was an inhabitant of a large\r\nmarine aquarium in the Museum at Scarborough. The period was July 1857.\r\nThe aquarium contained the ordinary assemblage of sea-shore animals,\r\nand a considerable collection of vegetation, which consisted of _Ulva_,\r\n_Fucus_, and other common sea-weeds.\r\n\r\nFor two days previous to its throwing off the shell, the Lobster was\r\nobserved in a very peculiar attitude, and to be very busily engaged.\r\nIts abdomen was permanently and stiffly erected and straight; while the\r\nanimal, in this rigid attitude, was hard at work detaching and carrying\r\nall the soft sea-weed it could collect to one end of the aquarium, where\r\nit thus accumulated a large mass of vegetation, which was afterwards\r\ndestined to become a screen and protection for its soft body. At the\r\nsame time, and by the same means, a clearing was made at the other\r\nend of the tank, in which it had space for the evolutions which were\r\nsubsequently necessary for the extrication of its body.\r\n\r\nThe Lobster remained in the peculiar rigid attitude I have described,\r\nduring the entire two days previous to the moult. On the third day, a\r\ncrack was observed along the membrane which unites the dorsal surface\r\nof the first abdominal ring with the carapace; and when these parts\r\nbecame separated by about half an inch, the bright-blue membrane of the\r\nnew shell being plainly visible beneath, the operation of extricating\r\nthe abdomen commenced. By a strong vibratory action of the whole\r\nabdomen, principally in a lateral direction, one segment was, at first,\r\nprotruded through the split; and this was followed by an interval of\r\ncomplete repose, during which the animal remained quite motionless.\r\nThen, by another vibratory action, the second segment was extricated;\r\nthen followed an interval of repose, when the third was withdrawn; and\r\nso on till, at last, the entire abdomen, after having been bent double\r\nupon itself, was turned completely out backwards, and then, elongated\r\nand compressed, remained above and parallel to the empty shell that it\r\nhad occupied, and which was still attached to the under surface of the\r\ncephalothorax. Hitherto the only orifice of escape consisted in the\r\ntransverse splitting of the first abdominal segment from the carapace,\r\non the dorsal surface. None of the abdominal segments separated from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThus far the extrication had commenced at the front of the abdomen,\r\nand had progressed from before backwards. It was now observed that\r\nthe carapace had split from behind forwards, the fissure commencing\r\nposteriorly at the transverse split between _the_ carapace and the\r\nfirst abdominal segment, and reaching forwards to the apex of the\r\nrostrum, which, however, it did not absolutely divide. The two halves\r\nof the carapace then separating posteriorly, the interval between\r\nthem, together with the original transverse slit, constituted a trifid\r\nopening, through which the rest of the animal escaped.\r\n\r\nThe escape of the cephalo-thoracic portion was effected from behind\r\nforwards. First the posterior ambulatory legs were loosened and\r\nwithdrawn; then followed the next pair; and this process was continued\r\nfrom behind forwards, pair by pair--the withdrawal of each pair of legs\r\nbeing followed by an interval of repose. The limbs were withdrawn very\r\nreadily from the old shell, slipping out of it as a leg would from a\r\nloose boot. No apparent effort accompanied these operations so far.\r\n\r\nThe extrication of the claws, however, was attended with much and\r\nviolent exertion. This consisted of two powerful and sudden tugs, the\r\nsoft abdomen of the Lobster pressing by its under surface upon the\r\nupper surface of the empty shell. By this means the soft chelæ were\r\ndrawn through the narrow joints of the old shell, exhibiting strong,\r\nunmistakeable marks of the violence and pressure to which they had been\r\nsubjected. The escape of the chelæ from their unyielding incasement\r\nwas not aided by any splitting of the old shell, the large soft hands\r\nbeing drawn by compression through the narrow joints, as a wire is drawn\r\nthrough the contracting holes of a draw-plate.\r\n\r\nThe efforts for the withdrawal of the chelæ were the last, and succeeded\r\nin completely freeing the Lobster from its old case. Not only the\r\nclaws, but the parts of the mouth, the antennæ, and the eyes, were\r\nall unsheathed; and with the last tug the regenerate Lobster plunged\r\nbackwards, and entirely escaped, above and behind the now empty\r\nshell--its former tenement.\r\n\r\nThe operation, from first to last, occupied about twenty minutes, and\r\nwas performed entirely in view, in that part of the aquarium which the\r\nLobster had cleared of sea-weed.\r\n\r\nImmediately after emerging from the old shell, the Lobster, was much\r\ndeformed: there was a general elongation of the whole animal; but this\r\nwas most remarkably the case with the claws, which were quite drawn out\r\nof shape. During the few subsequent hours, both the body and the claws\r\nbecame shorter and much enlarged. This increase of size did not result\r\nfrom any unfolding of membrane of the shell previously plicated, as no\r\nfolds were observable immediately after the emergence of the animal,\r\nbut from a simple distension, apparently from the imbibition, either\r\nby swallowing or by endosmosis, of considerable quantities of water.\r\nThe membrane of the new shell was perfectly soft, and of a bright blue\r\ncolour. At first the Lobster was shy and quite inactive, retiring to\r\nand remaining concealed among the accumulated sea-weed; but in a few\r\nhours it emerged from its retreat, and moved freely about the aquarium.\r\nThe membrane of the new shell remained soft for some days, but on the\r\nseventh it appeared to have become perfectly calcified.\r\n\r\nThese are the details of the exuviation of the Lobster whose cast-off\r\nshell is before the Society. By a happy accident, the same observers had\r\nan opportunity of witnessing the sloughing of another Lobster, in the\r\nmonth of November following. The process was identically the same in\r\nevery particular; but it was observed that the subsequent calcification\r\nof the shell did not take place till after the lapse of about fourteen\r\ndays,--a circumstance probably dependent on a lower temperature and a\r\nless active nutrition. These are, I believe, the only two instances in\r\nwhich the exuviation of the Lobster has been actually witnessed; but\r\nthere exist specimens of sloughs which are entirely in keeping with this\r\ndescription. In the fish-house of the Zoological Society of London there\r\nare two specimens which were cast in the tanks there; and in each there\r\nis the same transverse splitting of the carapace from the abdomen, and\r\nthe longitudinal splitting of the carapace itself, without any other\r\nopening for the escape of the animal.\r\n\r\nOne or two general observations are suggested by the foregoing\r\ndescription. In the only examples of the exuviation of macrourous\r\nDecapod Crustaceans, there exists a singular diversity in the\r\nprocess itself. In _Astacus_, as described by Réaumur, the process\r\ncommences with the escape of the cephalothorax; in _Homarus_, as I\r\nhave now described it, it begins by the emergence of the abdomen. In\r\n_Astacus_ the carapace is detached and thrown off bodily and unbroken,\r\nbeing severed from its attachments with the lateral portions of the\r\ncephalothorax, as is the case in the Brachyura; whereas in _Homarus_ the\r\nlateral attachments of the carapace remain, whilst the plate itself is\r\nsplit up the centre. In _Astacus_, as is also the case in the Brachyura,\r\nthe thrown-off slough is uniformly left resting on its dorsal surface;\r\nin _Homarus_ the reverse is uniformly the case. But the most striking\r\ndissimilarity is to be found in the circumstances _stated_ to attend the\r\nliberation of the chelæ. Prof. Bell, in the Introduction to his 'History\r\nof the British Stalk-eyed Crustacea,' remarks--\"It is impossible to\r\nimagine that the crust of the legs, and especially of the great claws\r\nof the larger species, could be cast off, unless it were susceptible of\r\nbeing longitudinally split\" (p. 35), and he then proceeds to give the\r\naccount detailed by Réaumur of the longitudinal splitting of the shell\r\nin the neighbourhood of the joints of the claws in _Astacus_, so as to\r\nallow of the extrication of the hands. Nevertheless, however impossible\r\nit may appear for the chelæ to escape without this splitting, no such\r\ncircumstance occurs in the exuviation of _Homarus vulgaris_; and when\r\nwe consider that the hands of _Astacus_ are small in proportion to\r\nthe wrist-joints, and that in _Homarus_ they are larger in proportion\r\nto those joints than in any other of the Macroura, this dissimilarity\r\nin the mode in which the claws escape is the more remarkable, and, I\r\nconfess, to my own mind it suggests the suspicion that the distinguished\r\nand usually most accurate French naturalist to whom I have referred may\r\npossibly in this instance have been led to consider as a fact that which\r\nwas to him a supposed necessity[9].\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing account of the moulting of the Lobster was written,\r\nI have dredged a specimen of the common shore-crab (_Carcinus mænas_),\r\nin the act of casting its shell. This little crustacean had taken\r\nrefuge, no doubt for the safe and secret performance of sloughing in\r\na forest of _Zostera_, on one of the mud banks in Poole Harbour, and\r\nwhile scraping these weeds with a keer-drag it fortunately fell into my\r\nnet. It shows how the Brachyura leave their old shells by the horizontal\r\nsplitting away of the carapace from the other portions of the shell--the\r\ncarapace itself remaining entire; and it also shows (and this was my\r\nprincipal object in exhibiting the specimen) the enormous amount of\r\nincrease of size upon emerging from the shell, and the rapidity with\r\nwhich that increase takes place. The animal, as now seen, is in exactly\r\nthe same state as when taken out of the water, and its bulk is probably\r\nsome four times larger than the area of the shell in which it had been\r\nencased only a few minutes before. I retained the Crab in connexion with\r\nits old shell, and prevented its further escape by wrapping it in paper,\r\nso that it could not move its limbs. I thought such a specimen would\r\nbe telling and illustrative, and that the old shell, being in contact\r\nwith the new, would afford facilities for contrast. In this condition\r\nthe Crab died, and, being out of water some time, it became dry, and\r\nthe soft new shell collapsed and bulged in; but, upon placing the dead\r\nCrab in sea-water, the soft shell very speedily imbibed sufficient\r\nfluid to distend it to its previous dimensions. This of course was\r\nsimply the effect of endosmosis. Mr. Couch, in describing the moulting\r\nof the common Edible Crab (_Cancer Pagurus_), speaks of its _drinking_\r\nlarge quantities of water, and _thus_ becoming distended; but I rather\r\nthink that the distension takes place by endosmosis, even during\r\nlife. There are two circumstances which militate against Mr. Couch's\r\nopinion:--first, the rapidity with which the distension occurred in the\r\nCrab I have just exhibited, while still in the act of moulting; and\r\nsecondly, that after death the same distension occurred when the Crab\r\nwas immersed in sea-water; in which case it could only be by endosmosis.\r\nIndeed to me it seems very probable that this very endosmosis, when the\r\nwater once comes in contact with the new, uncalcified shell, may, by\r\ndistending it, be the main agent in the breaking open and dissevering of\r\nthe elements of the old shell.\r\n\r\n    [9] The suspicion above expressed has been fully confirmed by\r\n    observations made by Mr. J. J. Bennett, the Secretary of the\r\n    Linnean Society. Mr. Bennett informs me that, in an aquarium in\r\n    his possession, an _Astacus fluviatilis_ has twice cast its shell,\r\n    and the process of moulting was on each occasion accomplished\r\n    without any splitting of the shell at the joints of the claws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Shell-bearing Mollusca, particularly with regard to Structure\r\nand Form. By ROBERT GARNER, Esq., F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[Abstract of a Paper read before the Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author commences the paper, of which the following is the substance,\r\nwith some general observations on the morphology of animals. He thinks\r\nthat the idea of an ascending and successive scale or chain of creation\r\nis, in the main, correct, when the great classes, and not species or\r\ngenera, are made the links,--the disturbing or modifying influences\r\nbeing due to modes of life, food, habitat, &c., and causing a different\r\n(say the quinary) distribution. He is an advocate, too, for the doctrine\r\nof one fundamental plan of organization, and thinks that, in the\r\nzoophyte, there is a real union of both the animal and vegetable\r\n_nisus_.\r\n\r\nThe great divisions of this chain, the _radiate_, _articulate_,\r\n_molluscous_, and _vertebrate_, constitute an ascending series; the\r\nlinks of the chain, so to speak, being in each case, for such an\r\nextent, of a particular pattern; but, nevertheless, one of the highest\r\nmollusks may surpass in organization one of the lowest fishes, or an\r\narticulate creature a mollusk. The author considers such great divisions\r\nof animals, as well as minor ones--the gasteropodous mollusks, for\r\ninstance--as realities, and not mere abstractions; and that they are\r\nindependent of the circumstances of food, habitat, locomotion, &c.,\r\njust referred to. So great, however, are these disturbing influences,\r\nthat they often produce an extraordinary external resemblance or\r\npseudo-analogy between animals of a very different nature, as between\r\na _Chiton_ and an _Oniscus_, and they are connected intimately with,\r\nthough not the cause of, what we call specific or generic distinctions.\r\nAërial life, in contradistinction to aquatic, raises much the character\r\nof the locomotive organs; yet this is subordinate to type: hence the\r\ncreeping Mollusk appears to have commonly a higher organization than the\r\nflying Insect.\r\n\r\nThe cartilages of _Sepia_ have a true resemblance to those of a Skate,\r\nand the Cirrhipede truly connects the Mollusk with the Crustacean.\r\nThe author regards _Dentalium_ as a gasteropod, differing in this\r\nrespect from Lacaze-Duthiers, whose beautiful paper, however, renders\r\nit supererogatory to say anything more on this animal, except that\r\nthe author believes that the presence of the spiniferous tongue, of a\r\nproboscis, and the nature of the food, are favourable to his view: he\r\nalso takes the feathery tufts to be the branchiæ.\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of _Aspergillum_ is similar to that of _Pholas_; its mantle,\r\nhowever, is all but closed in front, and ends in an obliquely-set\r\nmuscular disk, applied to the internal surface of the rose of the\r\nso-called _arrosoir_, the openings of this part of the shell giving exit\r\nto certain processes and fimbriæ of the fleshy disk,--a narrow slit\r\nbeing also left in both the muscular and shelly disks for the exsertion\r\nof the small, compressed and curved foot. The animal is enveloped\r\nwithin the shell by a rather horny, general membrane.\r\n\r\nThe author touches upon the anatomy of some other genera of\r\nLamellibranchiata. _Solemya_ has its firm, horny, dark cuticle doubled\r\ninwards from the valves over the tubular mantle; behind, it has an anal\r\nopening, and a second fringed branchial slit lower down: the branchiæ\r\nand tentacles are single on each side, the former being remarkably\r\nfeather-like. The foot is similar to that of the Solens, but crenate\r\nround its anterior disk. _Cyrenoidea_ has the mantle closed below, but\r\nwith two openings behind, the upper one with a semicircular internal\r\nfringe, incomplete above; a callous rim and fringe surround the mantle,\r\nwhich has also a third opening for the long, compressed, bent, and\r\nblunt foot. This last has a remarkable crystalline body, directed from\r\nthe stomach to the pedal pore, apparently, as in _Cardium_, subserving\r\nby its elasticity to the extension of the foot, and consequently to\r\nlocomotion; at any rate, it is not a sexual distinction. The external\r\nbranchiæ are short, and the upper or internal branchial cavity does\r\nnot communicate with the lower one. The renal organ opens near the\r\nbranchial nerve, and the ovary at the base of the abdominal mass.\r\n_Trigonia_ is remarkable for its beautifully fringed, open mantle,\r\nits pectinated pits for the secretion of the teeth, and the large\r\nscythe-shaped foot, trenchant before and peaked behind, and having a\r\nfringed disk. _Vulsella_ is allied to the Oyster, but more so to the\r\nPectens, having a small cylindrical grooved foot and appended visceral\r\nmass, but no byssus; the rectum perforates the heart, and has a tentacle\r\nabove its opening. _Perna_ has a similar foot, and a very bulky byssus,\r\nwith a large muscle attached to their base; the lips resemble those\r\nof the Oyster. The anatomy of _Crania_ is little different from that\r\nof _Orbicula_, as described by Owen,--the beautiful arms folded in\r\nseveral coils, with a simple mouth at their base, the stomach and short\r\nintestinal canal surrounded by the liver and hearts, and terminating\r\nby a lateral bend; the ovaries ramifying in the mantle; the adductor\r\nmuscles being four in number, with some bands to the mantle; and on\r\nthe latter, glandular markings corresponding with the microscopic\r\nsculpture of the shell. With respect to _Anomia_, the author has again\r\nbeen anticipated by Lacaze-Duthiers, though he has already given, in\r\nanother paper, most of its anatomy and morphology: he would simply call\r\nattention to its very long and curious crystalline stilette, unconnected\r\nwith the minute foot.\r\n\r\nWith respect to that _quæstio vexata_, the sexes of the\r\nLamellibranchiata, he observes that any number of individuals of\r\n_Cyclas_ may be examined, and young fry will be found in the branchial\r\nlaminæ in all; that all Oysters have ova, and also all individuals of\r\n_Pecten maximus_, the subpedal mass being visibly composed of an ovary\r\nand a testis. He is obliged to believe that one species of British\r\n_Anodon_ is universally oviferous. But the common Edible Cockle appears\r\nto have the individuals of different sexes, and the same may be said\r\nwith regard to _Mytilus edulis_ and _Patella_.\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoa in the Cockle are oblong and a little curved, and\r\ntorulated, as it were, whilst they are pear-shaped in _Mytilus_; they\r\nare also extremely minute, and their appendages must be very fine, for\r\nwith a power magnifying 500 diameters they are scarcely to be seen.\r\n\r\nIn the shell of a _Patella_, _Emarginula_, or _Haliotis_, we have the\r\ntwo conjoined valves of a lamellibranchiate mollusk; and through such\r\nforms as _Calyptræa_, _Hipponyx_, _Navicella_, and _Nerita_, we arrive\r\nat the ordinary form of the gasteropod with its operculum.\r\n\r\nThen follows a disquisition on the progressive tendency to a spiral\r\ngeometry in these animals, due to a varying plan of conformation,\r\nand not to the force of the heart, there being generally an atrophy\r\nof the left side of the body. In _Nautilus_ and _Argonauta_, the\r\nshell and mantle are reversed in position to what they are in the\r\nGasteropods, whilst _Sepia_ and _Hyalæa_ agree rather with the latter.\r\nThe symmetrical shell of the lower Gasteropods undergoes a lateral\r\ntorsion in the higher, spiral forms, to become again symmetrical in\r\nthe Cephalopoda. The branchiæ in _Patella_ retain a position analogous\r\nto that of the same organs in the Lamellibranchiata; in some Chitons\r\nthey have a tendency to retract towards the anus, as in _Doris_; in\r\n_Fissurella_ they waste at the sides and become developed above the\r\nneck, as in the spiral Gasteropods; but in them, the right branchia,\r\nand right side of the mantle are principally developed. From this\r\ntorsion arises the form and spire of the shell. In _Aplysia_, where\r\nthe branchial fissure is far back and to the right side, the right\r\nrespiratory nerve preserves a superior position, and passes backwards to\r\nform its ganglion at the front of the branchial opening; the left, on\r\nthe contrary, passes under the oesophagus to form a second ganglion,\r\nnot mentioned by Cuvier, behind the first. In the more spiral Gasteropod\r\nthe torsion is greater; the right nerve, for instance, mounts upwards\r\nover the digestive canal to form its ganglion quite in the left flank,\r\nwhilst the left goes below the digestive canal to attain the right\r\nflank. In _Sepia_ the branchiæ are again symmetrical and abdominal.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the young _Sepia_ is composed of distant plates, only\r\nconnected by minute transversely striated laminæ or flattened tubes,\r\nproducing by their insertion a beautiful appearance of sinuous lines,\r\nvery like those of a Baculite or Ammonite; and the spongy part of the\r\nshell, so constituted, is probably filled with air from the cavity of\r\nthe body situated immediately in front, the intervening membrane having\r\na peculiar structure. This cavity of the body exists in much lower\r\nmollusks; air being apparently secreted in it, to lighten the animal.\r\n\r\nThe author thinks that, in considering the anatomy and form of the\r\nbody of the Gasteropoda, about ten species may be taken as types of\r\ncorresponding families.\r\n\r\n1. PATELLA _and its congeners_.--He claims to have been one of the\r\nfirst to show the termination of the oviducts and renal organs between\r\nthe processes of the branchiæ in the Chitons. As they are commonly\r\nphytivorous, the intestine is often very long and disposed in large\r\ncoils, in double apposition; the buccal apparatus is very remarkable.\r\n_Chitonellus_ differs but slightly from _Chiton_, the central elements\r\nof its tongue, however, being little developed, though having the same\r\ntessellated basement membrane. The tongue of _Emarginula_ differs much\r\nfrom that of _Patella_, having an immense number of serrated side-hooks\r\nand a dilated middle portion.\r\n\r\n2. CALYPTRÆA, _&c._--The mollusks of this division have often\r\nsupranuchal branchiæ, as have some of the last; the sexes also are\r\nfrequently separate, rendering copulation necessary; and they are\r\nsometimes partially spiral, with a tendency to form an operculum.\r\nHowever, the little _Ancylus fluviatilis_ appears to be what is commonly\r\ncalled hermaphrodite, with a branchial lamina on the left side, together\r\nwith the heart and openings of the genital organs; the stomach has a\r\ncæcum, and the penis a long filiform appendage; the female parts opening\r\nnear the rectum and behind the male organs. It must respire by water\r\nrather than by air, for, in a rapid stream, the stones at the bottom\r\nare covered with _Ancyli_ (upon which also its round oothecæ, each\r\ncontaining four or five ova, are deposited), and it appears impossible\r\nfor them to get to the surface to breathe. On the contrary, the\r\nlake-_Ancylus_, though the margin of its mantle is ciliated, may perhaps\r\ncome to the surface, ascending the stalks of the Water Persicaria, on\r\nwhich it is mostly found, and on which its oothecæ are deposited. When\r\nthe dark cuticle of this last minute creature is removed, its organs\r\nmay be seen to be reversely disposed to those of the larger species, the\r\nheart being placed to the right, before the apex of the shell, and the\r\nrectum also on the same side.\r\n\r\n3. DORIS, _&c._--The little _Doris aspera_ swims, back downwards,\r\non the surface of a glass of sea-water, copulates, and deposits its\r\nsemicircular oothecæ. The brain of the common Lemon Doris is of a fine\r\norange colour, enveloped in a glandular matter, and is constituted by\r\na complicated assemblage of ganglia: there are acoustic sacs and dark\r\nocular spots upon it. There are six ganglia on the buccal mass, and\r\nabout six or eight minute ones on the stomach. The anal sac appears\r\nto be a purple- or ink-bag; and the so-called matrix is composed of a\r\npeculiar substance, swelling enormously in water, of which it renders\r\na large quantity viscid, and being also coagulable by alcohol and\r\nbichloride of mercury, but not by heat. Spermatozoa were found in the\r\ngenital vesicle, as well as in the epididymis and its cæcum. The spines\r\nof the lingual plate are uniform, and in number about 10,000.\r\n\r\n4. APLYSIA, _&c._--_Aplysia_ has been before alluded to. Cuvier, in\r\nhis generally beautiful drawings, has scarcely done justice to (5)\r\n_Ianthina_, nor to its beautiful float and ootheca; it is peculiar\r\nfor its fins, and the disk at the back of the foot. With respect to\r\n_Magilus_, it should be removed from the (6) Tubulibranchiata, its\r\nanimal being a _Purpura_ in structure, with a bent horny operculum, and\r\na very long linear appendage on the right side of the head, leading to\r\nthe supposition that the animals are of different sexes, though there\r\nseem to be difficulties in the way of sexual congress. In the specimen\r\nexamined, the spire of the shell was not solidified; the animal had a\r\nshort proboscis, with rather bent subulate feelers, and eyes on the\r\noutside; it had also a rich purple secretion near the rectum on the\r\nright side.\r\n\r\n7. TROCHUS, _&c._--Some of the species of _Trochus_ surpass even\r\n_Emarginula_ in the beauty of their lingual apparatus. The renal\r\norgan opens into the bottom of the branchial cavity, contrary to its\r\ndisposition in _Helix_ and _Lymnæus_, where its exit is near the\r\nrespiratory orifice. In _Planorbis_, that part of the respiratory cavity\r\nreceiving the excretions seems separated by an imperfect valve from the\r\nright portion. With respect to the secretion of this organ, it consists,\r\nin both Gasteropoda and Lamellibranchiata, of numerous pellucid globular\r\nbodies, containing opaque earthy nuclei or granules, and presenting\r\ndifferent appearances in _Anodon_ (for instance), _Cyclostoma_,\r\n_Buccinum_, and _Helix_. When these bodies are incinerated, lime is\r\nleft, which in some cases appears to have been combined with oxalic\r\nacid. The little _Nerita litoralis_ presents the structure of the\r\nTurbonidæ very prettily and in small compass, particularly in the very\r\nlong spiral tongue. _Delphinula_ has the fringed mantle and sides and\r\nvery wonderfully armed tongue of the other Trochidæ. _Melania_ is of\r\nsimilar organization to our well-known _Paludina_, the stomach compound,\r\nthe mantle and bilobed head fringed, and the latter marbled like that of\r\n_Paludina_. _Ampullaria_ appears to be truly amphibious.\r\n\r\n8. BUCCINUM, _&c._--_Natica_ presents much the same structure as the\r\ncommon _Buccinum_, but has a muscular disk anterior to the mouth,--a\r\ndisposition, with some variations however, found in other mollusks. The\r\nfirst and second stomachs are at a distance from each other, the tongue\r\nis little developed, and the branchiæ (often single in the Turbonidæ)\r\ntwo in number. _Purpura_ also differs but little from _Buccinum_.\r\n_Ovula_ is a less attainable mollusk: the foot is long and rather\r\nnarrow, and subventral rather than subtrachelian, with a sinuosity on\r\nthe right of the neck, where also is a short hooked penis in the male,\r\nreceiving a vas deferens from near the rectum behind; there is a large\r\nand small branchia, and the reflected portion of the mantle is covered\r\nwith tubercles and tentacles,--no doubt a fine garnish in the living\r\nanimal; the mouth has a muzzle, and there are small eyes on the external\r\nsides of the curved, awl-shaped tentacles; the elements of the tongue\r\nare beautifully toothed and serrated.\r\n\r\n9. LYMNÆUS, _&c._--Of the air-breathing aquatic and (10) terrestrial\r\ngasteropods the most interesting particulars are their generative\r\norgans, which the author proposes to re-examine. The brain of _Helix\r\naspersa_ is composed internally of pyriform or oval ganglionic vesicles,\r\neach giving origin to one or more nervous fibres. The acoustic sacs\r\nare similar to those of _Doris_. The nerves from the upper part of the\r\nring are enveloped in a darkish neurilema, and comprehend no doubt\r\nolfactory, optic, and tactile twigs; there being the buccal ganglia for\r\ntaste, and the acoustic sacs for hearing; the twigs, however, forming\r\nthe buccal or pharyngeal ganglia have a broad double root on each side,\r\nnear the origin of the above three nerves. The lower part of the brain\r\nis very analogous to that of _Sepia_, giving off nerves to the foot,\r\nand external and internal respiratory ones to the mantle, respiratory\r\nopening, branchiæ, &c. _Lymnæus_ has the cephalic ring formed by about\r\ntwelve ganglia, exclusive of two large and two minute ones on the buccal\r\nmass. The upper portion of the ring has ganglionic swellings, but in\r\nother respects the nerves are as in _Helix_. Its lower portion consists\r\nof two pedal nerves, and has the acoustic spot and a minute ganglion\r\nupon it; behind, this lower portion consists of five ganglia connected\r\nwith both the anterior and upper swellings by a cord, but separated from\r\nthe former by the aorta, as usual, and giving nerves to the flanks,\r\npulmonary orifices and sac, heart, stomach, and viscera. The lower\r\nganglia are bright yellow.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Pteropoda, the branchiæ in _Hyalæa_ exist as a\r\ndelicate membrane under the swollen part of the shell, in structure\r\nmuch like the same part in the Ascidians, the inlet being through the\r\nanterior opening of the mantle. There are eyes at the fold of the\r\nmantle behind, and two small tentacles above the mouth; the heart and\r\nrectum being on the left side, and the generative opening at the base\r\nof the right ala. _Cleodora_ is a very beautiful creature, with the\r\nsame disposition and structure of viscera; brain-spots but no eyes\r\nwere visible; the mantle had beautiful muscular bands; the branchiæ as\r\nabove; the buccal apparatus is imperfect in both. _Cleodora_ has similar\r\nmembranous expansions with _Hyalæa_, and also a sort of triangular lip.\r\n\r\n_Argonauta_ has a lachrymal pore before and beneath the eye. The\r\nbeautiful and obvious respiratory mechanism in the Cephalopoda needs\r\nnot to be described. There is a large sac behind the viscera of the\r\nArgonaut, which opens on each side; it is perhaps of some hydrostatic\r\nuse. There are at least three pairs of salivary glands, of which four\r\nopen on the floor of the mouth, and two or three at the commencement\r\nof the gullet. Several small shells of Pteropoda and fragments of\r\nCephalopods were found in the stomach, on which was observed the large\r\nnervous ganglion found in all these, as well as in lower mollusks.\r\nThe branchial nerves have each two ganglia, of which the last at the\r\nroot of the branchiæ is rounder than the other; the branchial hearts\r\nhave processes as in _Sepia_. In _Sepia_ two openings lead from the\r\nrespiratory sac into the cavity containing the venæ cavæ and their\r\nsecreting appendages often imbued with glittering crystalline particles,\r\nand from the above cavities a wider opening on each side leads into\r\na second sac further back, situated in front of the shell. There are\r\nauditory sacs in the Argonaut. The oviducts have separate openings, but\r\noriginate together. Both _Sepia_ and _Argonauta_ are infested with a\r\nsubcutaneous filiform entozoon, hooked anteriorly and rolled up spirally\r\nin the former. _Loligo media_ and _Sepiola_ have but one oviduct, and\r\nthe two large, glandular, laminated organs, opening at their summits,\r\nare wanting in _Argonauta_ and _Octopus_. In _Sepiola_ one would almost\r\nthink that copulation takes place, for the author has taken what he\r\nsupposes to be the capsules of Needham, with dilated oval ends, tubular\r\nand bent pedicles or processes, enclosed elastic filaments, and adhering\r\nzoosperms, from the oviducts of the female: he has made the same\r\nobservation also in _Sepia_. The latter has very similar male organs\r\nto _Octopus_, as described by Cuvier. In the embryo _Sepia_, the yelk\r\nenters below the mouth and opens into the upper stomach, but the beak\r\nof the animal also appears to be inserted into it behind. The vitellus\r\nin reality therefore enters by the foot, as it does in _Bulimus_, and\r\nprobably in all Bivalves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Linnean Manuscript of the 'Museum Ulricæ.'\r\n\r\nBy SYLVANUS HANLEY, Esq., F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[Read Dec. 3, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot the least important result of the investigations of the Committee\r\nappointed by the Linnean Society to examine the condition of the\r\ncollections and manuscripts of Linnæus, was the rediscovery of a written\r\ncopy of the 'Museum Ulricæ.' The volume was manifestly, from internal\r\nevidence, a legible transcript of the original manuscript of that\r\nwork, with alterations and interpolations in the peculiar handwriting\r\nof the author. It was, indubitably, the unpublished catalogue so\r\noften mentioned in the tenth edition of the 'Systema,' and contains\r\ndescriptions of certain species alluded to as defined, yet, strangely\r\nenough, omitted in the printed edition. It is worthy of notice for\r\nmany reasons: it corrects the frequent misprints; explains the many\r\nfallacious allusions to preceding species, their sequence being very\r\ndifferent; it exhibits those early synonyms, which, culled from\r\ncomparison with the actually described specimens, had been eventually\r\nsupplanted by supposed better representations; above all, it imparts to\r\nus those original headings, or diagnoses (condensed from the subsequent\r\ndetails), which had been suppressed, of old, in favour of those already\r\npublished in the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nThis wholesale substitution, adopted by Linnæus, as a ready method of\r\navoiding a tedious revision of all the headings, when he absorbed in the\r\nmore comprehensive groups of his 'Systema' the members of manuscript\r\ngenera he had determined to reject, involved a serious amount of\r\nconfusion; for, oftentimes, the species of the two works, although\r\ndesignated by the same appellations, were totally distinct; and the\r\ncombination of the diagnosis of the one with the details of the other\r\ndisplayed an array of features not known to be associated in any object\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nThe generic arrangement exhibited in the manuscript differs essentially\r\nfrom that which appeared in the final edition of his 'Systema Naturæ.'\r\nAs a whole, it is decidedly inferior, yet it segregates certain natural\r\ngroups, such as _Lyra_ and _Cassida_, the value of which have been\r\nacknowledged by all modern naturalists. The following list and sequence\r\nof the genera comprised in it, cannot, indeed, be regarded as an\r\nentire system, for certain groups, viz., _Chiton_, _Lepas_, _Teredo_,\r\n_Sabella_, and the typical forms of _Mya_, _Mactra_, and _Anomia_, were\r\nnot at that period represented in the Museum; but it is not devoid of\r\ninterest, since it manifests a transitional stage in the progressive\r\nadvance to that matured scheme which was finally elaborated in the pages\r\nof his revised 'Systema.'\r\n\r\n  Dentalium.\r\n  Patella.\r\n  Nerita.\r\n  Helix.\r\n  Turbo.\r\n  Trochus.\r\n    Turricula.\r\n  Buccinum.\r\n    Lyra.\r\n    Morion.\r\n  Conus.\r\n  Voluta.\r\n    Strombus (not that of the 'Systema').\r\n  Harpago (=Strombus).\r\n  Murex.\r\n    Cassida.\r\n  Cypræa.\r\n  Bulla.\r\n  Haliotis.\r\n  Nautilus.\r\n  Cymbium (=Argonauta).\r\n  Spondylus.\r\n  Ostrea.\r\n    Pecten.\r\n  Arca.\r\n  Pinna.\r\n  Mytilus.\r\n  Solen.\r\n  Tellina.\r\n    Chama (not that of the 'Systema').\r\n  Cunnus (=Venus).\r\n    Pholas (not that of the 'Systema').\r\n  Trunculus (=Donax).\r\n  Bucardium (=Cardium).\r\n\r\nBesides the four genera (_Chiton_, _Lepas_, _Teredo_, _Sabella_) that\r\nwere excluded from this catalogue, either from the absence of specimens,\r\nor from mistrust of their being veritable Testacea, six of the\r\nremaining 32, namely, _Pholas_, _Mya_, _Mactra_, _Chama_, _Anomia_, and\r\n_Serpula_, were likewise omitted, not being yet eliminated from _Solen_,\r\n_Bucardium_, _Spondylus_, _Ostrea_, and _Dentalium_. To counterbalance\r\nthese, we find no less than eight subsequently abandoned groupings:\r\n\r\n_Turricula_ (an undefined amalgam of the long-spired species of\r\n_Buccinum_, _Murex_, and _Strombus_).\r\n\r\n_Lyra_ (the _Harpa_ and _Purpura_ of the Lamarckian school).\r\n\r\n_Morion_ (an unnatural compound of _Eburna_, _Auricula_ proper,\r\n_Pythia_, _&c._).\r\n\r\n_Strombus_ (a combination of the immature members of the received genus\r\nwith _Pyrula_, _Fasciolaria_, and other allied forms).\r\n\r\n_Cassida_ (nearly the modern _Cassis_).\r\n\r\n_Pecten_ (equal to _Lima_ and _Pecten_).\r\n\r\n_Chama_ (the _Tapes_ of recent conchologists).\r\n\r\n_Pholas_ (chiefly composed of _Artemis_ and _Lucina_).\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, moreover, that the simple univalves commence, and\r\nthe bivalves close the series; the exact converse of the order in which\r\nthey are marshalled in the two principal editions of the 'Systema\r\nNaturæ.'\r\n\r\nI feel assured, after a careful study of the manuscript, that the names\r\neventually allotted to the shells of the 'Museum' did not result from a\r\ncareful comparison of the royal specimens with the typical examples in\r\nthe private collection of our author, but were attached to the species,\r\neither from the identity of the written and printed synonymy, or from\r\nthe general accordance of their described features with the meagre\r\ncharacteristics enumerated in the prior publication.\r\n\r\nThe erased nomenclature of the species, however, was very dissimilar,\r\nand was scrupulously based upon a supposed identity of the specimens\r\nwith those delineated by Rumphius, Klein, and d'Argenville. Assuredly\r\nat that period of his career, our author entertained the same profound\r\nrespect for the laws of priority which is professed by all modern\r\nnaturalists; and I hesitate not to affirm that, from the crude and\r\ninharmonious theories of his predecessors, he eliminated a system of\r\nConchology that was better suited to the requirements of the age he\r\nlived in than any more elaborate arrangement would have been. For\r\nsimplicity attracts the student, whom a more complex (even if more\r\nnatural) method would repel; and for the collection of an adequate mass\r\nof materials wherewith, eventually, to build up a more symmetrical and\r\nwidely-based structure, a multitude of comparatively unskilled labourers\r\nis more efficacious than a small knot of the most erudite architects.\r\n\r\nBefore inviting the attention of my readers to the original headings of\r\nthe 'Museum Ulricæ,' and to my brief account of the variations in the\r\nwritten copy from the text of the printed version, I must premise, that\r\nit has not been my practice invariably to notice, in the summary, such\r\ntrifling differences of construction as the preferential use of the\r\nablative for the nominative case, where the verbal change involved no\r\nalteration of the precise meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSEUM LUDOVICÆ ULRICÆ REGINÆ.\r\n\r\nCONCHYLIA.\r\n\r\nCHITON, LEPAS.\r\n\r\nNothing relating to these two genera was found in the copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOLAS.\r\n\r\nThe _Pholas_ of the manuscript is perfectly dissimilar to that of the\r\n'Systema.' Our author had evidently, when he first wrote the 'Museum\r\nUlricæ,' not appreciated the remarkably striking characteristics of this\r\ngroup, having located the only species he then knew (for _P. candidus_\r\nseems a subsequent discovery) with the _Solens_.\r\n\r\nP. CANDIDUS. Not mentioned in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nP. CRISPATUS. _Sol._ ovatus, obtusissimus, cardinis dente depresso\r\nrotundato.\r\n\r\nThe Appendix to Lister was not cited; \"Habitat in Anglia, Suecia,\" was\r\nappended to the description, which in many respects was inferior to the\r\npublished one. The account of the hinge was merely \"Cardo dente dilatato\r\nrotundato extus excavato.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMYA.\r\n\r\nThe three incongruous forms assorted as _Myæ_ were not so united in the\r\nMS.; the second being very properly placed with the _Mussels_, the other\r\ntwo ascribed to _Solen_.\r\n\r\nM. LUTRARIA. _Sol._ ovali-oblongus, cardine laterali dilatato\r\nsemiorbiculato.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of the reference to Lister (whose work does not appear to have\r\nbeen consulted by our author at the period when this portion of his\r\nmanuscript was written), plate 45, figure N, of Rumphius was quoted as\r\nillustrative. The published account of the hinge is much more complete\r\nthan the written one, which was apparently drawn up from a worn\r\nspecimen; it ran as follows: \"Cardo extus vix gibbus, intus constans\r\nlaminis 2 semiorbiculatis concavis introrsum spectantibus.\"\r\n\r\nBy a slip of the pen, in my \"Ipsa Linnæi Conchylia,\" I had termed\r\nBrown's figure of the Linnean _Mya lutraria_, _L. oblonga_, instead of\r\n_L. elliptica_.\r\n\r\nM. PERNA. _Myt._ lævis, cardine terminali unidentato.\r\n\r\nThe intended name was _M. Magellanicus_.\r\n\r\nM. VULSELLA. _Sol._ oblongus, linguæformis, cardine terminali dilatato\r\nsemiorbiculato.\r\n\r\n\"Pinna linguaformis subfalcata\" was written after the reference to\r\nthe 'Museum Tessinianum;' hence it seems that Linnæus did not himself\r\nconsider that he had used the binomial method in that work, or he would\r\nhave quoted it as _P. lingulata_.\r\n\r\n\"Rumph. 148. t. 46. f. A,\" and \"Gualt. t. 90. f. H,\" were the\r\nunpublished synonyms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLEN.\r\n\r\nTesta valvulis utrinque hiantibus. Cardo dente unico inflexo recurvo.\r\n\r\nThe _Mya lutraria_, _M. vulsella_, and _Pholas crispatus_ were\r\noriginally included in this genus.\r\n\r\nS. VAGINA. _S._ linearis rectus, cardinibus unidentatis.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat in Indiæ littoribus arenosis: in mari Rubro (_Hasselquist_)\"\r\nwas the recorded locality in the MS., where the European shell\r\ndelineated by Gualtieri was not then included: \"Klein, 163. t. 11. f.\r\n65\" (a copy from the cited figure of Rumphius) was its substitute.\r\n\r\nS. SILIQUA. _S._ linearis rectus, cardine altero bidentato.\r\n\r\nThe wretched drawings of Argenville were not quoted; but \"Bonan. 2. f.\r\n56\" (error for 57), \"Plane. t. 3. f. 6,\" and \"List. Ang. 192. t. 5. f.\r\n37,\" were cited instead.\r\n\r\nS. ENSIS. _S._ linearis subarcuatus, cardine altero bidentato.\r\n\r\nThe final remark was not in the MS.\r\n\r\nS. CULTELLUS. _S._ ovali-oblongus curvatus.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat in Amboinæ littoribus arenosis\" is an addition of the MS. The\r\nintended name (derived from Rumphius) was _cultriformis_.\r\n\r\nS. RADIATUS. _S._ ovalis, cardinis costa tereti.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat in littoribus arenosis Xulii(?) Amboinæ\" is an addition to\r\nthe published account. The intended specific name was _violaceus_, an\r\nappellation bestowed upon it by Rumphius: \"_solida_\" was an emendation.\r\n\r\nS. STRIGILATUS. _S._ ovalis, oblique striatus.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 2. f. 76\" (error for 77) was an unpublished synonym.\r\n\r\nS. ANATINUS. _S._ ovatus membranaceus, costa falcata.\r\n\r\n_Rostrum anatis_ was the intended name.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELLINA.\r\n\r\nTesta altero latere inflexa. Cardo dentibus aliquot, raro lateralibus.\r\n\r\nT. GARGADIA. _T._ antice rugosa, rima dentata.\r\n\r\nThe absurd \"marginis posticum latus remotum\" was a misprint for (dens)\r\n\"marginis posticus, latus, remotus.\"\r\n\r\nT. LINGUA-FELIS. _T._ subovata scabra.\r\n\r\n\"Klein, t. 11. f. 62\" (cited in the 'Systema'), and \"d'Arg. t. 25.\r\nf.G\" (the description of which suits better than the drawing) are the\r\nadditions of the MS.: \"sesquilatiore\" was the printed emendation of\r\n\"latiore.\"\r\n\r\nT. VIRGATA. _T._ ovata, striis transversis retrorsum imbricatis,\r\ndentibus lateralibus.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to d'Argenville was not present: \"Klein, 158.\r\nTellina virgata Rumphii\" had been added by Linnæus. A very large portion\r\nof the printed account is wanting in the MS., to wit--\"æquales. Intus\r\nradiis obsolete incarnatis picta.\" \"Labris rugosis et scabris,\" \"hymene\r\ntectis. Anus est rima concava,\" \"primores,\" \"transversi cum cavitate pro\r\noppositis dentibus,\" \"longitudinalem.\" The \"retrorsum\" was originally\r\n\"sursum\"; \"dextrum\" was \"sinistram\"; \"Tertius dens\" was \"Altera testa.\"\r\n\r\nT. GARI. _T._ ovalis, striis transversis retrorsum imbricatis, dentibus\r\nlateralibus nullis.\r\n\r\nThe G in the reference to Rumphius, and the F in the reference to\r\nd'Argenville were misprints for D and I, and were so published in the\r\n'Systema:' the \"primoribus\" was an emendation.\r\n\r\nT. ALBIDA. _T._ ovalis, lævis, nymphis prominulis. \"Primores\" was an\r\nemendation. The species was unnamed.\r\n\r\nT. FOLIACEA. _T._ antice scabra, rima serrata.\r\n\r\nThe Rumphian name \"folium\" was the intended appellation: \"Klein, 162. t.\r\n11. f. 64\" was cited, as in the 'Systema': \"aciatum\" was the reading for\r\nthe printed \"acutum.\"\r\n\r\nT. PLANATA. _T._ ovata plana, transversim striata, marginibus acutis.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to Gualtieri (whose figure C looks more like the\r\nspecies than his G) is not to be found in the manuscript. The species\r\nwas not named.\r\n\r\nT. LÆVIGATA. _T._ ovata lævis, nymphis intractis.\r\n\r\nThe figure of _T. chloroleuca_ in Rumphius was not quoted, neither was\r\nthe hence-derived appellation attached: the \"radiato\" and \"primoribus\"\r\nwere also subsequent additions.\r\n\r\nT. RADIATA. _T._ ovali-oblonga, longitudinaliter substriata, sutura\r\npostica canaliculata. \"Obsoletis\" and \"primores\" were subsequent\r\nemendations.\r\n\r\nT. ROSTRATA. _T._ oblonga, antice angulato-rostrata.\r\n\r\nThe _T. rostrata_ of the final edition of the 'Systema' was assuredly\r\nthe _T. Spengleri_, and with that shell solely will the printed\r\naccount in the 'Museum Ulricæ' accord. But the five earlier lines of\r\nthe description (save \"et albus\"), and the detailed dentition (except\r\n\"fossula distinctus\"), with the varieties _a_, _b_, _g_, and the same\r\nsynonyms as in the tenth edition of the 'Systema,' appear in the MS.\r\nwith the name _T. petasunculus_ attached. Whether designedly or not,\r\nthere was a pictorial definition of _T. vulsella_ in the earlier\r\n'Systema;' and if an author be not allowed to amend his description, _T.\r\nvulsella_ is better entitled than _T. Spengleri_ to the name _rostrata_.\r\n\"Margo exterior parum repandum est\" was written in the MS.\r\n\r\nT. REMIES. _T._ rugosa, suborbiculata.\r\n\r\nThe expressions \"hians,\" \"primores,\" \"remoti,\" and the last five words\r\nof the details were absent; \"utrinque\" followed \"duo\": \"non\" in place of\r\n\"vix\" was the earlier reading.\r\n\r\nT. SCOBINATA. _T._ scabra orbiculata.\r\n\r\n\"Primores,\" and \"in altera testa profunda fossula distinctus,\" were not\r\nin the copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDIUM.\r\n\r\nCardo dentibus baseos binis, marginis solitariis remotis acutis. Valvulæ\r\ngibbæ, hinc figura cordis.\r\n\r\nBUCARDIUM was the epithet applied in the written copy to the members of\r\nthis genus, to which the _Solen bullatus_ of the 'Systema' was correctly\r\nreferred. _Mactra_ had not then been separated.\r\n\r\nC. COSTATUM. _Buc._ sulcis costis elevatis membranaceis.\r\n\r\nThe original description has been somewhat enlarged in the press, by the\r\naddition of \"brevissimis,\" \"et extrorsum flexis,\" \"fossula distinctus;\r\nat vero ille sub anno quasi duplex\"; \"minus vero ad latera sulcata,\"\r\nmoreover, was simply \"ad alterum latus\": the only expression omitted in\r\nprinting was \"reflexus,\" which followed \"Anus margine.\"\r\n\r\nC. CARDISSA. _Buc._ compressum, valvis carinatis, natibus contiguis.\r\n\r\n\"Colum. Aqu. 19. t. 16\" (cited also in the 'Systema') was quoted in the\r\nMS. from which the \"vix,\" \"subcontigui,\" \"remotus, validus, fossula\r\ndistinctus,\" were absent. The \"Rima\" was termed \"subrotunda\" instead of\r\n\"cordata.\"\r\n\r\nC. HEMICARDIUM. _Buc._ subquadrilaterum: valvulis carinatis, umbonibus\r\ndistantibus.\r\n\r\n\"Fasciis\" was a misprint for the original \"facies\": \"sulcis convexis\"\r\nwas written \"sulcis excavato-rugosis.\" There was no specific\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\nC. MEDIUM. _Buc._ subcordatum subangulatum; valvulis angulatis sulcatis\r\nlævibus.\r\n\r\nThe prefatory remarks were the only portion of the printed description\r\nto be found in the MS. The species was not named, but was quoted in the\r\n'Systema' before the publication of its details.\r\n\r\nC. ACULEATUM (misprinted \"muricatum\"). _Buc._ subcordatum, sulcis\r\nconvexis, linea cava exaratis, versus apicem dentatis.\r\n\r\nThe intended name was _verum_.\r\n\r\nC. ECHINATUM. _Buc._ subcordatum, sulcis acutis exaratis linea elevata\r\nciliata aculeis inflexis plurimis.\r\n\r\n\"List. Ang. 188. t. 5. f. 33, Pectunculus echinatus,\" \"Bonan. 2. t. 90,\"\r\n\"Gesu. Aq. 131, 132,\" \"Faun. Suec. 1339,\" \"Rondel. Aq. 22,\" were the\r\noriginal synonyms, to which our author had subsequently added \"Klein,\r\n139. t. 10. f. 40.\" \"Alba\" followed \"gibba\"; \"parum antrorsum inflexis\"\r\nwas the reading for the printed \"erectis subulatis\"; \"extrorsum\" for\r\nthe \"uti extus\": \"brevioribus. Anus lævis, sutura simplici prominula,\"\r\n\"recurvi,\" \"fossula distinctus,\" were emendations.\r\n\r\nC. TUBERCULATUM. _Buc._ subcordatum, sulcis obtusis nodosis transversim\r\nstriatis.\r\n\r\n\"Gualt. t. 71. f. M.\" was a correct additional synonym.\r\n\r\nC. ISOCARDIA. _Buc._ cordatum, sulcis imbricatis squamis fornicatis.\r\n\r\n\"Klein, 138. isocardia fragum\" had been interpolated by Linnæus; hence\r\nthe name, which was not in the original. The \"fossula distincti\" has\r\nreplaced the earlier \"validi.\"\r\n\r\nC. FRAGUM. _Buc._ subcordatum subangulatum, sulcis notatis semicirculis\r\nelevatis.\r\n\r\nBy the addition of \"mala\" to the erroneously cited figure of Gualtieri,\r\nour author has virtually repudiated it. \"Spinosæ\" followed \"Pruni;\" the\r\nfallacious \"s. rubris\" was not present, nor \"sæpe\" either; \"anteriore\"\r\nstood in the place of \"postico,\" and \"postico\" in that of \"antico.\" The\r\ndescriptions of the \"rima\" and \"anus\" have been added: \"recurvati\" and\r\n\"fossula distincti\" were amplifications.\r\n\r\nC. UNEDO. _Buc._ subcordatum, sulcis lunulis coloratis.\r\n\r\nC. MURICATUM. _Buc._ subrotundum sulcatum, lateribus muricatis.\r\n\r\nC. MAGNUM. _Buc._ oblongum, sulcis angulatis latere serratis.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to have found the 19 a misprint, but the MS. and the printed\r\ncopy agree precisely in every particular.\r\n\r\nC. FLAVUM. _Buc._ subovatum sulcatum, latere altero scabrum, altero\r\ndentatum.\r\n\r\nThe redundant \"subovata\" was not in the copy, where the remark was made\r\nthat the species resembled the shell subsequently termed _Chama cor_,\r\nthe figure of which (Gualt. t. 71. f. E.) had been cited, but erased in\r\nthe MS. The ideal hence derived is a very different shell from the one\r\nsupposed identical. No mention is made of lateral teeth: was it then a\r\nveritable _Cardium_?\r\n\r\nC. LÆVIGATUM. _Buc._ ovatum, striis læviusculis longitudinalibus.\r\n\r\nI do not consider this (the _B. striatum_ of the MS.) to be identical\r\nwith the _C. lævigatum_ of the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nC. SERRATUM. _Buc._ ovale læve, antice serratum.\r\n\r\n\"Ovata\" stood in the place of the printed \"obovata\": \"curvatus\" and\r\n\"parvi\" were subsequent to the MS.\r\n\r\nC. TRISTE. _Buc._ ovatum læve, rima anoque obsolete striatis.\r\n\r\nThe 'Museum' was referred to for this shell previously to the\r\npublication of the details. Curious to relate, the species was wholly\r\nomitted in the twelfth edition of the 'Systema.' It was, in all\r\nprobability, a _Mactra_, which genus had not been constituted at the\r\nperiod when the description of _C. triste_ was issued.\r\n\r\nC. PECTINATUM. _Buc._ subcordatum, striis hinc longitudinalibus, illine\r\ntransversalibus.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not present in the written\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMention was made in the 'Systema' of a _Solen bullatus_, for a more\r\ndetailed account of which the reader was referred to the 'Museum\r\nUlricæ.' No such species appeared in the published edition; but the\r\nomitted shell (a veritable _Cardium_) was thus described in the\r\nunprinted version:--\r\n\r\nBUC. BULLATUM. _B._ subrotundum, antice crenato-hians.\r\n\r\nRump. 143. t. 44. f. N. Pecten bullatus.\r\n\r\nTesta subrotunda, inflata, gibba, fragilis, pellucida, substriata,\r\nrufo nebulosa, antice hians, margine serrato. Umbones tumidi, obtusi,\r\nreflexi. Rima minima brevissima. Ani regio obsoleta. Dens cardinis fere\r\nunicus, minimus. Marginales solitarii, remoti, compressi, majores.\r\n\r\n\r\nDONAX.\r\n\r\nTRUNCULUS was the proposed name of this genus, which was thus\r\ncharacterized:--\r\n\r\nTesta compressa, antice obtusissima, retusa. Cardinis dentibus 2,\r\nmarginis unicus.\r\n\r\nD. SCORTUM was wisely omitted.\r\n\r\nD. PUBESCENS. _Trun._ antice spinis ciliatus.\r\n\r\nD. RUGOSA. _Trun._ antice rugosus, marginibus crenatis.\r\n\r\nThe printed \"cuneiformis\" has replaced the earlier \"majuscula\"; and\r\n\"crenulatis\" was originally \"undulatis.\" \"Intus subviolacea est\" was not\r\nin the written copy.\r\n\r\nD. TRUNCULUS. _Trun._ antice lævis, marginibus crenatis.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Klein was not in the original, but \"d'Arg. t. 25.\r\nf. L.\" was quoted (as in the twelfth edition of the 'Systema'). The\r\nlast seven words printed were not in the copy. The intended name was\r\n_gibbus_.\r\n\r\nD. CUNEATA. _Trun._ cuneiformis, marginibus integerrimis.\r\n\r\nThe final remark was not in the copy, where \"parva, ovata,\" preceded\r\n\"cuneiformis.\" The then unpublished details were quoted in the\r\n'Systema.'\r\n\r\nD. SCRIPTA. _Trun._ ovatus lævis scriptus.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous citation of Gualtieri (a misprint for 88. f. Q.) was not\r\nin the copy, and, as the figure represents the _D. trunculus_ in the\r\npage opposite, I suspect was carelessly placed here by the printer, when\r\nour author had inserted it in his revised proof. I suspect this error\r\noften occurred, as for instance in _Tellina planata_ and _radiata_,\r\nwhere Gualtieri's figure (added during revision) was attached to the\r\nformer instead of to the latter. \"Margo interne crenulatus,\" and nearly\r\nthe entire account of the teeth, were emendations.\r\n\r\nD. MURICATA. _Trun._ ovatus, striis muricatis, margine denticulato.\r\n\r\n\"Postice solitarii\" followed the final \"utrinque\": \"primores\" was an\r\nemendation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS.\r\n\r\nThis genus (as a whole) was not to be found in the manuscript System.\r\nIts components were distributed into three groups, two of which bore\r\nnames that were subsequently allotted to forms very remote from those\r\ntherein so designated.\r\n\r\nCUNNUS. Testa subrotunda. Rima nymphis instructa. Dentes cardinis 4,\r\nlateralibus divaricatis versus latera. This contained the bulk of the\r\n_Veneres_, all except Nos. 63, 66, and those referred to _Pholas_ and\r\n_Chama_.\r\n\r\nPHOLAS. Testa lenticularis. Rima fissa, destituta nymphis. Dentes\r\ncardinis 1 s. 2, marginalis tantum intra anum. _V. Pennsylvanica_,\r\n_incrustata_, _punctata_, _edentula_, _exoleta_, _scripta_, _pectinata_,\r\n_ziczac_ were its constituents.\r\n\r\nCHAMA. Testa ovalis cum angulo. Cardo dentibus 4 confertis, quorum\r\nunus in singula valvula bifidus. In this were located _V. literata,\r\nrotundata, decussata_.\r\n\r\nV. DIONE. _Cun._ cordatus, antice pubescenti-spinosus.\r\n\r\nThe same references to Petiver, Olearius, and Lister were present as in\r\nthe 'Systema.' The final remark was an addition. The proposed name was\r\n_C. Veneris_.\r\n\r\nV. MARICA. _Cun._ subcordatus, decussatim striatus, pube lamellosa.\r\n\r\nV. DYSERA. _Cun._ testa subcordata, sulcis transversis reflexis, labiis\r\nconcavis incumbentibus.\r\n\r\nNeither \"Huic rugæ, &c.,\" \"lævis,\" nor the synonym of Lister were in\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nV. CHIONE. _Cun._ subovatus, lævis.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to d'Argenville was not inserted in the MS.,\r\nfrom which \"lanceolatis,\" likewise, was absent.\r\n\r\nV. MACULATA. _Cun._ testa ovato-cordata lævis.\r\n\r\n\"Lanceolata\" and \"ovato-oblongus\" have been additions. The observation\r\nthat it was difficult to distinguish this shell (which was not named\r\nin the MS.) from the following, would mislead one, since the remark\r\nreferred to two unpublished species, which it originally preceded.\r\n\r\nV. MERETRIX. _Cun._ subcordatus glaber, labris gibbis, nymphis apice\r\nhiantibus.\r\n\r\n_C. vulgatus_ was the name originally designed.\r\n\r\nV. CASTRENSIS. Cun. suborbiculatus glaber, characteribus scriptus.\r\n\r\nV. MEROE. _Cun._ sutura postica hians.\r\n\r\nV. FIMBRIATA. _Cun._ subrotundus decussatus rugosus, longitudinaliter\r\nstriatus.\r\n\r\nD'Argenville was not referred to.\r\n\r\nV. RETICULATA. _Cun._ subcordatus, striis crenatis decussatis, ano\r\ncordato.\r\n\r\nV. tigerina. Cun. suborbiculatus, striis crenatis decussatis, ano ovato.\r\n\r\nThe name was an error, having been derived from the \"Lingua tigerina\" of\r\nRumphius (his figure G., not H.): _fuliginosus_ was the one originally\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nV. PROSTRATA. _Pho._ orbiculata, transverse striata, labiis\r\nscabro-membranaceis.\r\n\r\nThe unpublished details had been previously referred to in the\r\n'Systema.'\r\n\r\nV. PENNSYLVANICA. _Pho._ glabra, rugosa, antice sulco longitudinali.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat in Pennsylvania,\" and \"subdiaphana,\" were the unprinted\r\nadditions. The \"margo interne crenatus,\" \"nates sub-recurvatæ,\" and\r\n\"color intus versus marginem violaceus,\" were not in the copy. The last\r\ncharacter (so utterly inappropriate to the features of _Lucina P._) was,\r\nI suspect, intended for _punctata_ on the page opposite.\r\n\r\nV. INCRUSTATA. _Pho._ glaberrima lævissima, punctis excavata.\r\n\r\nThe details were referred to in the 'Systema' before their publication.\r\n\r\nV. PUNCTATA. _Pho._ longitudinaliter sulcata.\r\n\r\nThe G in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written\r\nD, from which figure (\"Chama pectinata\") our author had proposed to\r\nborrow the specific name, but subsequently had preferred the published\r\ndesignation. \"Klein, 147. Actinobolos æquilatera\" has been added to the\r\nMS. by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nV. EXOLETA. _Pho._ decussatim striata.\r\n\r\nThe original synonymy and details have been so transmuted in the\r\npress, that it is manifest that the amended (!) species was perfectly\r\ndistinct from the shell originally designed. The name of the latter was\r\n_clathrata_, and the declared sculpture was not merely \"transversim,\"\r\nbut \"et longitudinaliter\" likewise (in place of \"striis retrorsis\"). The\r\nreference (added by Linnæus) was not to Gualtieri, but to Lister, 335,\r\nf. 172, and its copy in Klein (t. 10. f. 52), both which would have more\r\nappropriately been assigned to _V. reticulata_. The _V. exoleta_ having\r\nbeen previously defined in the 'Systema,' this confusion becomes of\r\nlittle importance.\r\n\r\nV. ZICZAC. _Pho._ striis transversis membranaceis erectis.\r\n\r\nThe number which indicates the position of this species in the 'Museum'\r\nhas been subsequently ('Syst.' ed. 12) referred to _V. cancellata_, yet,\r\njudging from the generic appellation (and consequent dentition), it\r\ncould scarcely have been that well-known species. The \"lentiformi\" of\r\nthe 'Systema' (ed. 10), where the name _ziczac_ first appeared, forbids\r\nthe annexation; but, although the details of the 'Museum' were there\r\nreferred to, the obnoxious word was not mentioned in that publication.\r\nThe following are the printed emendations (?): \"lævis, et quasi excisa,\"\r\n\"compressa,\" \"variat colore albissimo.\"\r\n\r\nV. PECTINATA. _Pho._ sulcis longitudinalibus nodosis, antice antrorsum\r\nramosa.\r\n\r\nThe additional synonym of \"Gualt, D. 75, f. A.\" appears in the MS.,\r\nwhere \"quam reliquæ\" follows \"orbiculata,\" and in place of \"In area\r\nantica\" may be read \"et a primo sulco.\" The details there terminate with\r\nthe word \"lanceolatum,\" \"_Ramosa_\" was the intended name.\r\n\r\nV. SCRIPTA. _Pho._ striata, postice angulo recto circumscripta.\r\n\r\nThe incorrect figure of d'Argenville was not indicated.\r\n\r\nV. EDENTULA. _Pho._ subgloboso-lenticulata rugosa edentula.\r\n\r\nV. LITERATA. _Cha._ transversim striato-ovata.\r\n\r\nThe earlier reading of confertim was \"profunde\"; \"striis crenulatis\r\nantice et postice,\" \"lanceolata,\" and \"tres s.\" were absent.\r\n\r\nV. ROTUNDATA. _Cha._ transversim striata ovata absque angulo.\r\n\r\nThe printed additions are \"varius in variis,\" \"aut albis,\" \"lanceolata,\"\r\nand the final remark. There was no name attached in the MS.\r\n\r\nV. DECUSSATA. _Cha._ testa ovata, decussatim striata.\r\n\r\n\"Sæpe\" and \"minimus\" are the sole printed additions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProbably the _V. Phryne_ of the 'Systema' was designed by the following\r\nunpublished description:--\r\n\r\nCUN. VENOSUS. C. subcordatus lævis lateribus rugosis. Testa cinerea,\r\nnuce coryli major, gibba, glabra, antice et postice transversim sulcata.\r\nMargo exterius tantum denticulatus, non vero apex externus, aut margines\r\nlaterales.\r\n\r\nThe _V. macrodon_ answers fairly enough to this definition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONDYLUS.\r\n\r\nThis very natural genus was confused with _Chama_, and thus\r\ncharacterized:--\r\n\r\nTesta imbricata. Cardo e callo gibbo oblique inserto fossula obliqua.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nS. GÆDEROPUS. _S._ imbricatus auritus, cardine dentato.\r\n\r\n\"Rumph. t. 48. f. 1,\" \"Gualt. t. 99. f. E. F. G,\" \"Bonan. 2. f. 21,\"\r\n\"Rondel. c. 40. p. 41,\" were the additional synonyms of the MS. The \"ad\r\ncardinem truncata\" was an emendation for the previous \"breviore\": the\r\n\"superiore\" a misprint for the written \"inferiore\": the final remark was\r\nnot present.\r\n\r\nS. REGIUS. _S._ spinosus sulcatus inauritus cardine dentato.\r\n\r\nNo name was attached to this species: the previous one had been termed\r\n_Pectinites_.\r\n\r\nS. PLICATUS. Not mentioned in the manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMA.\r\n\r\nThe members of this genus were included in _Spondylus_, except\r\n_cordiformis_, which was referred to BUCARDIUM.\r\n\r\nC. GIGAS. _Sp._ plicatus squamosus, ano hiante crenato.\r\n\r\nThe species as originally defined was more comprehensive in its details\r\nthan when printed; for the restricting \"decussatim\" had not been added,\r\nand \"Gualt. t. 93. f. B.\" was an additional synonym. The printed\r\nadditions were \"obsoletis,\" \"Margine reflexo,\" \"exteriore duplicato\r\nlongiore,\" and the final remark. _S. imbricatus_ was the intended name.\r\n\r\nC. HIPPOPUS. _Sp._ plicatus muricatus, ano retuso clauso dentato.\r\n\r\n\"Arg. t. 26. f. H.\" was an additional synonym of the MS.: the printed 20\r\nshould have been 10, as written: \"ut in præcedente\" was an emendation:\r\n_S. asper_ was the proposed name.\r\n\r\nC. LAZARUS. _Sp._ imbricatus.\r\n\r\nSeba was not cited: \"obliquam\" followed \"fossam\" in the MS.\r\n\"Elevatis,\" \"longitudine testæ,\" \"productiore,\" \"instar auris\" formed\r\nno portion of the early description.\r\n\r\nC. ANTIQUATA. _Sp._ subcordatus, sulcis perpendicularibus transversim\r\nstriatis.\r\n\r\nNo name was attached to the original details, which appear to have been\r\naltered (\"in aliis minimum cordatum impressum fuscum\"), and the synonym\r\nof Bonanni added, in order to comprise that species (_Cardita sulcata_)\r\nwhich had been pictorially defined in the 'Systema.' \"Gibba\" was\r\npreceded by \"admodum\": \"obsoletis\" was not present. _Cardita bicolor,\r\nvar. unicolor_ was probably intended.\r\n\r\nC. SEMIORBICULATA. _Sp._ semiorbiculatus compressus, decussate striatus,\r\nrudis.\r\n\r\n\"Interior\" was the earlier reading of \"primarius.\"\r\n\r\nC. CORDATA. _Sp._ cordatus, transversim striatus, hinc elongatus,\r\ncompressus.\r\n\r\nC. OBLONGA. _Sp._ oblongus, antice angulatus, dentibus anticis acutis.\r\n\r\n\"Unico\" (error for \"unicus\") originally preceded \"in altera valvula.\"\r\n\r\nC. CORDIFORMIS. _Buc._ subrotundum læve, umbonibus recurvatis.\r\n\r\nThe brief description in the 'Systema' had evidently been copied in the\r\nmanuscript by our author himself, who cited Gualt. t. 71. f. E. as the\r\nsole synonym. The specimen had apparently been added to the collection,\r\nsubsequently to the drawing up of the first catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCA.\r\n\r\nTesta crassa, umbonibus distantibus intus fornicatis. Cardo planus,\r\nmasticatus dentibus numerosis minimis æqualibus transversis.\r\n\r\nA. TORTUOSA. _A._ oblonga obliqua, valvula altera oblique carinata.\r\n\r\n\"Nates, &c.\" and \"Cardo, &c.\" were the printed additions to the earlier\r\ndescription. The 'Systema' synonyms of Klein (t. 8. f. 16) and Bonanni\r\n(2. f. 128) were present in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nA. NOÆ. _A._ oblonga angulata hians.\r\n\r\nThis manuscript furnishes us with the additional synonyms of\r\n\r\n\"Aldrov. 3. p. 513.\" and \"Sloan. Hist. 2. p. 257. Musculus Matthioli,\"\r\nbesides the previously published references to Lister (368. n. 208)\r\nand Bonanni (2. t. 32). The formation of the hinge was not, however,\r\nindicated, and the passage commencing with \"Nates\" has been enlarged\r\nfrom \"Umbones remotissimæ, area interjecta concava, ad angulum rectum\r\nstriata. Margo exterior in medio hians, apertura barbata.\"\r\n\r\nThe intended specific epithet was _A. Noemi_.\r\n\r\nA. ANTIQUATA. _A._ testa oblique cordata, transversim sulcata, antice\r\nangulo compresso, rima intra rhombum transversim striata.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of two species (at the least) in the published edition\r\nresulted from the amalgamation of two earlier descriptions. To the above\r\ndiagnosis belonged the printed details with the following important\r\nchanges. In place of \"extus striata longitudinaliter sulcis crenatis,\"\r\nthe reading was simply \"intus striata longitudinaliter,\" and in lieu of\r\n\"interjecto spatio rhombeo plano,\" merely \"rima patens.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposed name for this shell, from a supposition of its identity\r\nwith the _Pecten virgineus_ of Rumphius, was _A. virginea_. The other\r\nspecies which Linnæus referred to the same numerals of the 'Systema' was\r\nnot named, but was thus characterized:--\r\n\r\nA. (Sys. n. 144). _A._ cordata, sulcis nodosis, rima decussatim striata.\r\n\r\nList. Hist. ... Pecten polyleptoginglymus, &c.\r\n\r\nGualt. t. 87. f. C.\r\n\r\nTesta reliquis magis gibba, albido-flavescens, sulcis xxx obtusis,\r\ntransversim nodosis: nodis transversis, obtusissimis, imbricatis.\r\nIntus albida. Margo dentibus xxx argutiusculis. Rima sulco rhombeo\r\ncircumscripta, disco decussatim vix manifeste striato. Umbones distantes\r\nad neutrum latus flexi.\r\n\r\nA. SENILIS. _A._ oblique cordata, octosulcata, lævis, antice hians, rima\r\nobtusangule striata.\r\n\r\nLister (without numerals!) was referred to in illustration; the early\r\nunimproved account of the beaks and ligamental area ran as follows:\r\n\"Umbones distantes, oblique incurvati. Rima hians striata transversim ad\r\nangulos acutos\": \"et profunde immersis\" was an addition.\r\n\r\nA. GRANOSA. _A._ subcordata, sulcis muricatis, rima obtusangule striata,\r\nutrinque angulum formante.\r\n\r\nThe name was evidently borrowed from Rumphius, whose _Pecten granosus_\r\n(\"143. t. 44. f. K.\") was referred to in the manuscript, though neither\r\nquoted in the printed copy nor in the 'Systema' (ed. x.). \"Bonan. 2. n.\r\n73,\" and Lister (without numerals) were also cited.\r\n\r\nA. DECUSSATA. _A._ lenticularis, decussatim substriata, apicibus\r\nreflexis.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed account of this shell, to which no specific name was\r\nattached in the MS., the 'Museum Ulricæ' was referred to, previous to\r\nits publication.\r\n\r\nA. PALLENS. _A._ lenticulari-subobliqua, decussatim striata, rima brevi.\r\n\r\nThis was the type referred to in the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nA. PECTUNCULUS. _A._ lenticularis sulcata, decussatim rugosa.\r\n\r\n\"Arg. t. 27. f. B,\" and Lister without numerals appended, were the\r\nunpublished synonyms. The expressions \"leviter,\" \"exteriore tenui;\r\nsulcata,\" \"in arcum,\" were not parts of the original copy, which\r\ncontained, however, the unprinted paragraph \"latere interiore margine\r\nprominente notato.\" There was no specific name attached to either this\r\nor the next species.\r\n\r\nA. GLYCIMERIS. _A._ lentiformis, transversim substriata, rima lævi.\r\n\r\nThe '_Chama glycimeris Bellonii_' of Lister (t. 247) was an unprinted\r\nsynonym.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following suppressed description of an unnamed Ark that was allied\r\nto, if it were not, _fusca_ or _barbata_, was found in the manuscript.\r\nThe 'Museum' had been referred to in the synonymy of the latter in the\r\n'Systema,' but the species was not mentioned in the published version.\r\n\r\n_Arca_ ovalis, compressiuscula, apicibus subcontiguis.\r\n\r\nTesta rudis, ferrugineo-fusca, longitudinaliter striata, striis quasi ex\r\npunctis callosis concatenatis, alternis striis majoribus ovatis, parum\r\nobliqua, minus lateribus gibba, rotunda absque angulis. Margo æqualis,\r\nedentulus. Apices recurvi fere tangunt se invicem. Rima dentibus\r\nminutissimis, antice longius extensa, nec recta.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTREA.\r\n\r\nThe very natural genus _Pecten_ was separated from the unsymmetrical\r\noysters, with the following definition:--\r\n\r\nPECTEN. Testa subrotunda, altera planior, basis transversa, anguli\r\ntransversi (auriculæ) ad basin. Cardo cavitas conica, striis utrinque 3\r\nlongitudinalibus obliquis.\r\n\r\nThe genus OSTREUM, enlarged by the addition of the true oysters\r\nconfounded with the _Mytili_, the _Meleagrinæ_, _Aviculæ_, and the\r\n_Anomia placenta_, was thus characterized:--\r\n\r\nO. MAXIMA. _Pec._ radiis 14 rotundatis longitudinaliter striatis.\r\n\r\nIn place of Gualtieri, \"List. Ang. 184. t. 5. f. 29. Pecten maximus,\"\r\nand \"Faun. Suec. 1343\" were referred to: these synonyms had been added\r\nsubsequently to the description.\r\n\r\nO. JACOBÆA. _Pec._ radiis 14 angulatis, fornicis longitudinaliter\r\nstriatis.\r\n\r\nThe cited drawing of Gualtieri was not mentioned.\r\n\r\nO. ZICZAC. _Pec._ radiis 18 explanatis.\r\n\r\nNo specific name was attached to this, the preceding, and the next two\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nO. STRIATULA. _Pec._ radiis 16 obliteratis, transverse\r\nmembranaceostriatis, margine integerrimo.\r\n\r\nO. MINUTA. _Pec._ radiis 20 convexis.\r\n\r\nO. PLEURONECTES. _Pec._ radiis 12 duplicatis, extus lævis.\r\n\r\nO. OBLITERATA. _Pec._ radiis 24 duplicatis, extus lævis.\r\n\r\nO. RADULA. _Pec._ radiis 6 convexis decussate striatis, margine crenato,\r\nauriculis æqualibus.\r\n\r\nO. PLICA. _Pec._ radiis 16 convexis læviusculis, decussato-striatus.\r\n\r\nNo specific name was appended to either this, the next, or the two\r\npreceding species.\r\n\r\nO. PALLIUM. _Pec._ radiis 12 convexis, striatus, scaber, squamis\r\nimbricatus.\r\n\r\nThis with the remainder of the _Pectens_ (as far as _flavicans_) formed\r\na group characterized by \"Auricula altera intus ciliato-spinosa.\"\r\n\r\nO. NODOSA. _Pec._ radiis 9 nodoso-vesicularibus.\r\n\r\nO. PES-FELIS. _Pec._ radiis 9, lævis, fornice squamis fornicatis.\r\n\r\nThe printed diagnosis, or heading, was evidently drawn up from a\r\ndifferent shell.\r\n\r\nO. PELLUCENS. _Pec._ radiis 9, lævis, fornice squamis\r\ncochleari-hemisphæricis.\r\n\r\nNo name was attached to this or the next shell.\r\n\r\nO. SANGUINEA. _Pec._ radiis 22 scabris, semiauritus.\r\n\r\nThe reference was not to plate 74 (as printed) of Gualtieri, but to\r\nplate 73. \"Purpureus nigro undatus\" was written after the indicated\r\ncolouring.\r\n\r\nO. VARIA. _Pec._ radiis 30 scabris explanatis.\r\n\r\n\"Et omnia cadem\" followed \"sanguineæ\"; \"striis compressis echinatis\" was\r\nnot present; \"color pallidior\" was in the place of \"concolor.\"\r\n\r\nO. PUSIO. _Pec._ radiis 40 filiformibus.\r\n\r\nO. GLABRA. _Pec._ radiis 10 lævibus planiusculis, internis striis\r\nelevatis duplicatis.\r\n\r\nGualtieri's rude drawing was not quoted.\r\n\r\nO. OPERCULARIS. _Pec._ radiis 20 subrotundis, decussate striato-scaber,\r\noperculo convexiore.\r\n\r\nO. GIBBA. _Pec._ radiis 20 glabris, gibbus.\r\n\r\nBrown's drawing was not quoted.\r\n\r\nO. FLAVICANS. _Pec._ radiis 8 striatis, margine altero rotundato.\r\n\r\nAs in the 'Systema,' the next two shells, along with this, formed a\r\ngroup distinguished as having the \"Valvulis altero latere magis gibbis.\"\r\nNo names had been appended to this, the three preceding, and the two\r\nfollowing species.\r\n\r\nO. FASCIATA. _Pec._ radiis 20, auriculis æqualibus exoletis.\r\n\r\nThe \"gibba\" of the borrowed diagnosis was not, it may be observed, in\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nO. LIMA. _Pec._ radiis 22, imbricatis squamis, altero margine rotundato,\r\nauriculis obliteratis.\r\n\r\nThe \"gibba\" of the borrowed heading was not in the original diagnosis.\r\nThe final remark was likewise absent.\r\n\r\nO. ISOGNOMON. The entire account of this species was added to the copy\r\nin the Linnean handwriting. \"Klein, 128. t. 8. f. 15. Isognomon\" and\r\n\"Cardo ut ephippo\" had been omitted in printing.\r\n\r\nO. MALLEUS. _O._ trilobum.\r\n\r\n\"Transverso ad marginem\" was a subsequent addition.\r\n\r\nO. FOLIUM. _O._ ovatum, lateribus obtuse plicatum.\r\n\r\nKlein's copy (t. 8. f. 22.) of the indicated figure in Rumphius was\r\ncited, in the handwriting of Linnæus: the \"cavitate conica\" was an\r\nemendation.\r\n\r\nO. EDULE. _O._ subrotundum semiorbiculatum, valvula altera plana\r\nintegerrima.\r\n\r\nThere was no semicolon after \"opaca,\" but a comma after \"latiore.\" The\r\noriginal sole synonym was the omitted one of \"Gualt t. 102. f. B.\"\r\n\r\nO. SEMIAURITUM. _O._ semiauritum ovatum læve, basi obliqua.\r\n\r\nLinnæus himself had added this species to the earlier catalogue.\r\n\r\nO. EPHIPPIUM. _O._ submembranaceum curvum, cardine octosulcato.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the published _Ostreæ_, the following description of the\r\nshell subsequently termed _O. perna_ (Syst. ed. 12.) was found in the\r\nmanuscript:--\r\n\r\n_O._ rugosum, inæquale, tumidiusculum, cardine octocrenato.\r\n\r\nTesta perniformis, obovata, substantia ligni antiqui, tumidiuscula,\r\nsuperficie obsolete rugosa, inæquali interne livida. Cardo transversus,\r\nmargine inflexo, notatus crenis obtusis circiter 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOMIA.\r\n\r\nThe single species here mentioned was comprehended in _Ostreum_.\r\n\r\nA. PLACENTA. _O._ orbiculatum planum pellucidum.\r\n\r\nReference was made, by a long periphrasis, to plates 225, 226 of\r\nLister's 'Historiæ'; Seba was not quoted: \"intra discum testæ adnatis\"\r\nwas absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYTILUS.\r\n\r\nTesta opaca, læviuscula. Cardo nullis dentibus instructus, sed fossula\r\nobliqua intra marginem.\r\n\r\nThis definition very properly excluded the oysters which had been\r\nerroneously inserted in this genus. Only the _Mytili_ and _Modiolæ_ of\r\nLamarck were left as members; for _margaritiferus_ and _hirundo_ were\r\ntransferred to _Ostreum_!!\r\n\r\nM. FRONS. _Ost._ acutum plicatum, labio altero scabro.\r\n\r\nM. CRISTA-GALLI. _Ost._ acutum, plicatum, labio utroque scabro.\r\n\r\nThe reading of the MS. was not \"secundum marginem insculptus,\" but\r\n\"secundum marginem Mytilus.\"\r\n\r\nM. HYOTIS. _Ost._ subacuto-plicatum imbricatum squamis compressis, labio\r\nutrinque glabro.\r\n\r\nM. MARGARITIFERUS. _Ost._ semiauritum, imbricatum tunicis, basi\r\ntransversum.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 2. f. 1.\" was the omitted synonym. The description of the hinge\r\nwas not at first inserted.\r\n\r\nM. UNGUIS. _M._ subrotundus, longitudinaliter striatus, pellucidus.\r\n\r\nThis ambiguous species was not named, but placed next to _Ostrea\r\nedulis_. I entertain but little doubt of its being a young _Perna_.\r\n\r\nM. LITHOPHAGUS. _M._ cylindricus.\r\n\r\nNeither Gualtieri nor d'Argenville was referred to, which confirms\r\nmy idea that the species of the 'Museum' (termed _coriaceus_ in the\r\nmanuscript) was not the Mediterranean _Lithodomus_.\r\n\r\nM. BILOCULARIS. _M._ striatus, cardine fornicato.\r\n\r\nM. EXUSTUS. _M._ striatus, dorso angulato.\r\n\r\nM. EDULIS. _M._ lævis, subcurvatus, cardine terminali mutico.\r\n\r\nThe printed synonyms are additions. From the \"crassa,\" and the \"absque\r\ndenticulo,\" it is by no means improbable that some large exotic species\r\nwas intended. The proposed name was _niger_; and that word originally\r\nformed part of the heading, but had been erased by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nM. UNGULATUS. _M._ læviusculus, valvis obliquis postice dilatatis,\r\nantice apice.\r\n\r\n\"Lineis\" was \"tunicis\" in the original. I do not consider that the\r\ndetails of this species (the _M. rusticus_ of the MS.) pertain, even\r\ngenerically, to the _ungulatus_ of the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nThe large _Mytilus_ represented by Gualtieri was not quoted: the\r\nreference, on the contrary, was to the two _Modiolæ_ depicted by\r\nRumphius (\"Rump. 151. t. 46. f. B. C.\") and to their Kleinian names\r\n(\"Klein, 127. Musculus acutus vulgaris, a. b.\"); and to that genus,\r\nrather than to _Mytilus_, does the account of the suture, and the final\r\nremark, apply.\r\n\r\nM. MODIOLUS. _M._ lævis, cardine sublaterali, margine dorsali dilatato.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous, yet approximate, synonyms of Rumphius and Gualtieri (the\r\n4 H's of whose engraving represent 4 different shells) were not quoted\r\nin the original. The species (for want of a good figure) was not clearly\r\ndefined until the twelfth edition of the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nM. VIRIDIS. _M._ lævis membranaceus, cardine terminali.\r\n\r\nM. RUBER. _M._ rugosus, valvulis obliquis, postice dilatatis, margine\r\nantico apicem æquante.\r\n\r\nThe preceding mussel spoken of was not _viridis_, but _ungulatus_. The\r\nreading was not \"brevissimo, compresso,\" but \"brevissime compresso.\"\r\n\r\nM. HIRUNDO. _Ost._ valvis bilobis, lobo anteriore angustiore longiore.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 2. f. 57\" (error for 58) and \"List. 220. f. 55\" were quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINNA.\r\n\r\nThe definition was not precisely similar in words to that of the\r\n'Systema,' but the sense varied but little. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\nTesta oblonga, membranaceo-fragilis, basi angustata. Cardo nullus, sed\r\nvalvis altero latere coadunatis ut una appareat.\r\n\r\nP. RUDIS. _P._ rugosa squamis fornicatis per seriem digestis.\r\n\r\nThe name of this shell, identified (I think wrongly) by our author\r\nwith the one he had termed _rudis_ in the 'Systema,' was originally\r\n_fornicata_.\r\n\r\nP. NOBILIS. _P._ squamis canaliculato-tubulosis subimbricatis.\r\n\r\nP. MURICATA. _P._ striata, squamis concavis ovatis acutis.\r\n\r\n\"List. Hist. t. 370. no. 215,\" and \"Sloan. Hist. i. p. 254,\" were\r\npresent among the original synonyms.\r\n\r\nP. ROTUNDATA. _P._ squamis obsoletis, testæ margine rotundato.\r\n\r\nP. SACCATA. _P._ nuda saccata erectiuscula.\r\n\r\nP. DIGITIFORMIS. _P._ nuda digitiformis incurva.\r\n\r\nP. LOBATA. _P._ nuda lobata.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the printed species, an anomalous _Pinna_, which I doubt\r\nnot was the _Lingula anatina_, is here described.\r\n\r\nP. VIRIDIS. _P._ ovalis, basi compressa.\r\n\r\nGeneris dubii huc relata, donec certiora determinentur.\r\n\r\nTesta utraque ovali-oblonga, viridis, intus magis pallida; quasi\r\ncompressa, et fere naviculata, acutior.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGONAUTA.\r\n\r\nThe intended name of this genus was _Cymbium_, the one applied to it by\r\nGualtieri.\r\n\r\nA. ARGO. _Cym._ carina dentata.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 1. f. 13,\" and \"Klein, 3. t. 1. f. 3,\" were the unprinted\r\nsynonyms. The intended specific epithet was _C. papyraceum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTILUS.\r\n\r\nThere was no definition of either this, or of the preceding genus, in\r\nthe written catalogue.\r\n\r\nN. POMPILIUS. _N._ apertura cordata, anfractibus contiguis.\r\n\r\nThe unprinted synonyms were \"Bonan. 1, f. 1, 2,\" \"Breyn. Polyth. 14,\"\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 3. f. 7,\" \"Pet. Gaz. t. 99. f. D,\" \"Klein, 2. t. 1. f. 1,\r\n2,\" and \"Bellon. Aquat. 318. t. 382.\" Seba was not quoted.\r\n\r\nN. SPIRULA. _N._ apertura orbiculari, anfractibus distantibus.\r\n\r\nThe I in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written 1;\r\n\"Bon. 1. f. 39,\" \"Breyn. Polyth. 21. f. 2,\" \"Klein, 5. t. 1. f. 6,\" and\r\n\"Petropol. Mus. 532. n. 6,\" were the unprinted synonyms: \"tubo\" was an\r\nemendation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONUS.\r\n\r\nTesta oblonga, cylindrica, deorsum attenuata. Apertura longitudinalis.\r\nLabium edentulum. Os non reflexum. Columella integra.\r\n\r\nThis most natural genus had the precise limits ordinarily assigned to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nC. MARMOREUS. _C._ conicus fuscus, maculis ovatis albis.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 3. f. 123\" was an additional synonym; the \"versus basin\r\ntransverse striata,\" and \"subtruncata, apice prominulo,\" with the\r\naccount of the variety, were not found in the MS.\r\n\r\nC. IMPERIALIS. _C._ pictus fasciis flavis cingulisque linearibus albo\r\nfuscoque articulatis.\r\n\r\nThe \"obconica\" was simply \"conica\"; there was no description of the\r\nspire.\r\n\r\nC. LITERATUS. _C._ conicus albus punctis fuscis.\r\n\r\nThe spire was not described: the reference to d'Argenville was I, not\r\n_Q_.\r\n\r\nC. VIRGO. _C._ striis convexis lævibus, basi cærulescente.\r\n\r\n\"Longa\" was originally \"magna\": the erroneous reference to Gualtieri was\r\nnot inserted.\r\n\r\nC. CAPITANEUS. _C._ conicus, basi fusca, spiræ anfractibus\r\nadscendentibus.\r\n\r\nAt least two species were confused; but, from the heading, it is clear\r\nthat _C. generalis_, rather than _C. capitaneus_, was the typical form:\r\nthe latter was the variety _g._\r\n\r\nThe V in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written Y:\r\n\"Gualt. t. 20. f. G.\" and \"Pet. Gaz. t. 27. f. O.\" were additional\r\nsynonyms. \"Notata lituris undatis fuscis\" was not in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nC. PRINCEPS. _C._ flavus, lineis fusco-purpureis longitudinalibus\r\nramosis.\r\n\r\n\"Sub\" preceded \"convexa.\"\r\n\r\nC. AMMIRALIS. _C._ basi punctato-scaber.\r\n\r\nAfter \"summus\" was written \"cingulo albo\"; after \"ordinarius,\" \"cingulo\r\nnullo\"; Seba was not quoted; \"pruniformis\" was the earlier reading\r\nfor \"conico-convexa, pyriformis.\" The variety _a._ was described as\r\n\"circumdata lineis numerosis albis nigro articulatis, quarum quæ\r\ncylindrum distinguit a spira latior maculis albis nigrisque majoribus\r\nalternantibus.\" The variety _g._ was not originally present in the\r\ncatalogue, but was interpolated by Linnæus. \"Hæc pretiosissima ut\r\nvendita fuerit 500 florenis\" was the final remark.\r\n\r\nC. NOBILIS. _C._ subcylindricus lævis glaber, spira acuta argute\r\ncanaliculata.\r\n\r\n\"Cacumen\" was a misprint for the written \"acumen.\"\r\n\r\nC. GENUANUS. _C._ pictus cingulis linearibus albo fuscoque articulatis.\r\n\r\nA strange confusion took place between the details of _C. senator_\r\nand _C. Genuanus_. The published description belonged to the former,\r\nthe synonym the latter, and should have preceded the following brief\r\ndescription:\r\n\r\n\"Testa conica, pallida, glauca, oblongiuscula. Lineæ 19 transversæ\r\nfusco-nigræ s. purpurascentes albo interruptæ, alternæ sæpe\r\nangustiores. Spira subconica, obtusa.\"\r\n\r\nC. GLAUCUS. _C._ emarginatus, basi striatus, spiræ inermis anfractibus\r\nconvexis.\r\n\r\nC. MONACHUS. _C._ gibbus acutus, fusco-cærulescente nebulosus, basi\r\nstriatus.\r\n\r\nBonanni was not quoted in the written copy.\r\n\r\nC. MINIMUS. _C._ cinerascens, punctis oblongis cinctus.\r\n\r\nThe original description has been much altered by Linnæus. It ran as\r\nfollows: \"Testa ovata, glauco-cinerea, gibba, striæ transversales\r\nplus 30 punctis fuscis oblongis. Spira convexa, alba, maculis fuscis\r\nmagnis transversis.\" The cited figure does not even suit these meagre\r\ncharacteristics, which might have been equally applied to _C. glaucus_.\r\n\r\nC. RUSTICUS. _C._ ovatus, basi rugoso-scaber, spira conica convexa.\r\n\r\nThe variety was not noticed, and d'Argenville was not quoted in the\r\noriginal catalogue. \"Flavo et glauco\" should have been \"flavo aut\r\nglauco,\" as written.\r\n\r\nC. MERCATOR. _C._ ovatus, albus fasciis reticulatis flavis.\r\n\r\nC. BETULINUS. _C._ subemarginatus, basi rugosus, spira planiuscula\r\nmucronata.\r\n\r\nSeba was not cited.\r\n\r\nC. FIGULINUS. _C._ emarginatus, basi rugosa, spira convexa acuta.\r\n\r\nAn additional synonym, \"Rump. t. 31 (error for 33, there being no number\r\n1 in that plate) f. 1,\" was indicated.\r\n\r\nC. EBRÆUS. _C._ ovatus albus fasciis nigris ex maculis transversis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 99. f. 12.\" was quoted.\r\n\r\nC. STERCUS-MUSCARUM. _C._ emarginatus, basi striatus, spiræ anfractibus\r\ncanaliculatis.\r\n\r\nOf the two species confounded under this designation the _C. arenarius_\r\nappeared as a variety in the manuscript. Of the typical form \"Spira\r\nlævi,\" \"Pet. Gaz. t. 75. f. 1,\" and \"Rumph. Mus. t. 33. f. Z,\" were\r\ncited as illustrations; the other synonyms were ascribed to \"Var.\r\nα. coronatus spinis obtusis.\" The colouring was not mentioned.\r\n\r\nC. VARIUS. _C._ scabro-coronatus, elongatus, spira coronata acuta.\r\n\r\nC. GRANULATUS. _C._ scaber inermis, striis lævibus.\r\n\r\nThe original size indicated was \"magnitudine coryli.\"\r\n\r\nC. MAGUS. _C._ subcylindricus, fasciis longitudinalibus albo punctatis.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous figure of d'Argenville was not referred to; and the\r\n32, Q (as in the 'Systema'), not 34, A, of Rumphius was quoted as\r\nillustrative. The final remark had been interpolated by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nC. STRIATUS. _C._ ovato-oblongus gibbus nebulosus, striis tenuissimis\r\nparallelis fuscis.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cæterum testa minus ante convoluta est,\" is a press addition. \"Pet.\r\nGaz. t. 98. f. 9.\" was correctly cited.\r\n\r\nC. TEXTILE. _C._ pictus venis reticulatis luteis, maculis luteis\r\nfuscisque.\r\n\r\nThe intended name (_C. drador_) was an amusing specimen of conchological\r\nLatin: it was of course borrowed from d'Argenville's appellation of\r\n\"_Drap d'or_.\" \"Columella ad postica quasi replicata est\" was added in\r\nthe printing; the \"luteo\" was originally \"albo\"; the \"subconica\" was\r\n\"anfractibus subconicis\"; and there was no mention of a variety.\r\n\r\nC. AULICUS. _C._ pictus venis reticulatis fasciisque longitudinalibus\r\ninterruptis fuscis.\r\n\r\n\"Columella postice replicata est,\" and the objectionable \"obovato-sub,\"\r\nwere not in the copy. No figures were cited in the original catalogue.\r\n\r\nC. SPECTRUM. _C._ cærulescens, flavo-nebulosus, punctis striisque\r\nalboluteis.\r\n\r\nThe original description did not comprise those characteristics which\r\nare so much at variance with the essentials of the _C. spectrum_ of\r\nauthors. The following passages were omitted: \"gibba, minus arcte\r\nconvoluta\" (this replaced \"conica\"), \"Columella postice striata et\r\nreplicata. Intus testa sub-cærulescens,\" \"mucrone cingulis granulato.\"\r\n\r\nC. BULLATUS. _C._ flavus, albo nebulosus.\r\n\r\nThe account of the variety, and the \"vix tuberculata,\" were absent from\r\nthe manuscript.\r\n\r\nC. GEOGRAPHUS. _C._ oblongus gibbus coronatus.\r\n\r\nThe Rumphian name was the one attached to this species in the written\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nC. TEREBELLUM. _C._ scaber inermis, striis tuberculatis.\r\n\r\nThe synonyms attached to the published details were \"Gualt. Test. t.\r\n25. f. L.--Arg. Conch. t. 16. f. P.--Rumph. t. 33. f. EE.\" Now these\r\nharmonize with both the heading and the description, and clearly\r\nindicate the _C. Nussatella_ of the 'Systema'!\r\n\r\nThe details attached to the published synonyms (which latter belonged to\r\nthe _C. terebellum_ of the 'Systema,' and to which were joined \"Gualt.\r\nt. 23. f. O.--\"Bonan. 3. f. 57.--Pet. Amb. t. 13. f. 24,\") ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Testa cylindracea, glabra, antice angustior, desinens in spiram\r\nattenuatam, anfractibus 3. Basis truncata, tennis. Columella non torta,\r\nsed involuta. Color pallidus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCYPREA.\r\n\r\nTesta ovata lævis involuta. Apertura linearis, utrinque dentata. Spira\r\noccultata intra testam.\r\n\r\nC. MAPPA. _C._ subturbinata characterisata, macula longitudinali\r\ndentata.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 2.\" was an omitted synonym. The terminal remark\r\nis an improvement upon the earlier \"Noscitur linea utrinque dentata in\r\nsuperficie scripta.\"\r\n\r\nC. ARABICA. _C._ subturbinata characterisata, macula longitudinali\r\nsimplici.\r\n\r\n\"Denticulis testaceis\" and the description of the variety were\r\nadditions by the hand of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nC. ARGUS. _C._ subturbinata subcylindrica, maculis annularibus.\r\n\r\nThe synonyms of Petiver (t. 97. f. 6) and Bonanni (f. 263), quoted in\r\nthe 'Systema,' were also present in the MS., where \"2. s. 1\" was in\r\nthe place of \"duabus.\" The \"pallidis\" was a misprint for the written\r\n\"pallidæ.\" The account of the variety was subsequent to the copy.\r\n\r\nC. TESTUDINARIA. _C._ obtusa cylindrica, extremitatibus depressis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 8. f. 7.\" was an unprinted synonym.\r\n\r\nC. CARNEOLA. _C._ subturbinata pallida, fasciis incarnatis.\r\n\r\nC. TALPA. _C._ subturbinata violacea, fasciis pallidis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 1.\" was an unprinted synonym: \"pallide\r\nflavescens\" was the earlier reading for \"testacea.\" The final remark\r\nwas not in the copy.\r\n\r\nC. AMETHYSTEA. _C._ subturbinata, dorso violaceo.\r\n\r\nRumphius was not originally cited as illustrative.\r\n\r\nC. VANELLI. _C._ subturbinata, maculata punctis lutescentibus.\r\n\r\n\"Obsoletis\" was originally in the place of \"acutis\": the \"sæpe\r\nlutescentibus\" was an addition of the press. _C. Ovum Vanelli_ was the\r\nintended designation.\r\n\r\nC. LOTA. _C._ subturbinata alba, denticulis subulatis.\r\n\r\nC. FRAGILIS. _C._ subturbinata gibba fragilis, obsolete fasciata.\r\n\r\nLinnæus himself inserted this heading, with the first three lines of the\r\nprinted details, in the manuscript copy. Neither the reference, nor the\r\nlonger account of the variety (evidently a different species) appeared\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nC. CAPUT-SERPENTIS. _C._ obtusa triquetro-gibba, postice obtusiuscula.\r\n\r\n\"Fusis\" was the earlier reading for \"confertis.\"\r\n\r\nC. MAURITIANA. _C._ obtusa triquetro-gibba, postice depresso-acuta.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 96. f. 8. ex Insula Mauritii\" was added in the manuscript:\r\n\"fuscus\" was the earlier version of \"fusco-testaceus.\"\r\n\r\nC. VITELLUS. _C._ subturbinata livida, maculis albis.\r\n\r\nThe published reference was substituted for \"Bonan. 3. f. 254,\" a\r\nmore characteristic figure: \"maxima ex parte distincta, sed\" followed\r\n\"Spira.\" \"Albida,\" not \"alba,\" was the tint at first ascribed to the\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nC. MUS. _C._ obtusa subovalis gibba cinerea, fascia longitudinali fusca.\r\n\r\nOur author himself inserted the account of this species in the\r\nmanuscript. Seba was not quoted. \"Habitat in Carthagena\" was appended to\r\nthe description.\r\n\r\nC. TIGRIS. _C._ obtusa ovata, postice obtusa.\r\n\r\nIn the synonym of Rumphius, 36 is a misprint for 38: the erroneous\r\nreference to the H of Gualtieri was not in the copy, where \"Pet. Gaz.\r\nt. 96. f. _7_\" was indicated as illustrative. The printed additions\r\nwere \"aut alba,\" \"fusco-ferrugineis\" (in lieu of \"fuscis\"), and \"s.\r\nalba, quasi exarata; postice subcylindrica, truncata\"; the previous\r\nwords \"Linea, &c.\" of that sentence were also absent from the original\r\ndescription, but had been inserted by the hand of Linnæus. \"Postice\"\r\npreceded \"planiusculo,\" and \"subviolaceo\" followed \"nitore.\"\r\n\r\nC. LYNX. _C._ oblongo-ovata, linea flavescente, postice acutiuscula.\r\n\r\nNo variety was mentioned in the written copy.\r\n\r\nC. ISABELLA. _C._ obtusa cylindrica, extremitatibus luteis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 16.\" was cited in the manuscript, where the final\r\nremark was wanting.\r\n\r\nC. ONYX. _C._ umbilicata, subtus fusca.\r\n\r\nNeither of the synonyms was quoted in the copy.\r\n\r\nC. SUCCINCTA. _C._ umbilicata, labio interiore utraque extremitate\r\nrotundato.\r\n\r\nThe entire account of this shell (the _C. bicincta_ of the MS.) was\r\nadded to the copy by our author.\r\n\r\nC. ZICZAC. _C._ umbilicata, subtus lutea punctis fuscis.\r\n\r\nNone of the cited figures were referred to in the original, where\r\n\"interiore\" stood in the place of the printed \"utroque fusco.\"\r\n\r\nC. HIRUNDO. _C._ umbilicata, supra cærulescente.\r\n\r\n\"Sparsis\", \"s. fusca\", \"necnon macula, &c.\" were emendations of the\r\npress: \"postice\" preceded \"fere marginato\" in the original.\r\n\r\nC. ASELLUS. _C._ umbilicata alba, fasciis tribus fuscis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 18.\" and \"Pet. Gaz. t. 97. f. 11.\" were cited in\r\nthe copy as illustrative.\r\n\r\nC. CRIBRARIA. _C._ umbilicata, maculis albis.\r\n\r\n\"Margo\" preceded \"adscendens\" in the copy, in which \"livide flavo\" was\r\nfound in place of \"luteo\": \"flavicantibus\" was omitted. The intended\r\nname was _C. Argiolus_.\r\n\r\nC. ERRONES. _C._ umbilicata, macula testacea æquali.\r\n\r\n_Erratica_ was the original specific appellation.\r\n\r\nC. MONETA. _C._ marginate-nodosa.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 97. f. 8.\" and \"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 8.\" were omitted in\r\nprinting; \"subflavescente\" followed \"convexo\"; \"subtus planiuscula\" and\r\n\"incisis\" were absent. In place of the final remark (added, however,\r\nby the hand of our author), there originally stood \"Noscitur tuberibus\r\nquinque elevatis.\"\r\n\r\nC. ANNULUS. _C._ marginata annulo flavo.\r\n\r\nThe \"s. rotundata\" was added in printing.\r\n\r\nC. EROSA. _C._ marginata flava albo-punctata.\r\n\r\n\"Undique aspersa\" and \"Macula fusca notat medium utriusque lateris\" are\r\nthe printed emendations.\r\n\r\nC. HELVOLA. C. marginata, postice crenata, subtus flava immaculata,\r\nsupra albo punctulata.\r\n\r\nThe final remark was unwritten, and the size not mentioned: \"marginis\r\ngibbi\" was \"margine exteriore gibbo\", and \"subcrenati\" was \"latere\r\nsubcrenato.\"\r\n\r\nC. STOLIDA. _C._ marginata variegata cinereo testaceoque.\r\n\r\n\"Quinque\" and \"adspersis\" were not in the original.\r\n\r\nC. OCELLATA. _C._ marginata lutea, ocellis nigris.\r\n\r\nC. FLAVEOLA. _C._ marginata fulva, albo punctata.\r\n\r\nC. PORARIA. _C._ marginata subviolacea, albo punctata.\r\n\r\nC. PEDICULUS. _C._ transversim sulcata.\r\n\r\n\"List. 168. t. 3. f. 17.\" and \"Barr. t. 1326. f. 28.\" were cited in\r\naddition to the printed synonyms. The last four words of the description\r\nwere not in the copy.\r\n\r\nC. NUCLEUS. _C._ sulcata punctata tuberculis, rostrata.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 16 f. 11.\" was cited as illustrative.\r\n\r\nC. STAPHYLÆA. _C._ punctis elevatis sine striis, subrostrata.\r\n\r\nThe printed \"minus\" has been substituted for the earlier \"vix\"; \"lutea\"\r\nfor \"flava\"; and \"totam basin\" for \"maximum partem baseos.\"\r\n\r\nC. GLOBULUS. _C._ rostrata lævis.\r\n\r\nThe printed additions were \"alba s.\", \"extremitate utraque\" (in place\r\nof \"postice\"), \"Superficies punctis vix manifestis notata\", and\r\n\"excurrentes in strias\".\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLA.\r\n\r\nTesta subrotunda, inflata, lævis. Apertura oblonga, non utrinque\r\ndentata. Spira obsoleta. Columella obliqua.\r\n\r\nThe _Murex ficus_ and _rapa_ of the printed edition were originally\r\nlocated in this genus, from which _Auris Midæ_, _Auris Judæ_, and\r\n_achatina_ were excluded: the two former were placed in _Morion_, the\r\nlast in _Buccinum_.\r\n\r\nB. OVUM. _B._ birostris, labio dentato.\r\n\r\n\"Arg. t. 21. f. A.\" \"Pet. Gaz. t. 94. f. 7.\" \"Pet. Amb. t. 8. f. 6.\"\r\nwere additional references in the written copy: \"magnitudine ovi\r\ngallinacei\", \"apice et basi producta\", were emendations during the\r\nprinting. The \"dilatata\" was originally modified by a \"parum.\"\r\n\r\nB. VOLVA. _B._ birostris, rostris elongatis striatis.\r\n\r\n\"List. t. 711. f. 63\" had been added to the copy by the hand of Linnæus.\r\nThe mode of reference (not, as in the earlier writings, by sections and\r\nchapters) evinces that this addition was, in all probability, subsequent\r\nto the publication of the work.\r\n\r\nB. VERRUCOSA. _B._ angulata, aucta utrinque puncto osseo.\r\n\r\nThe correct synonyms of \"Arg. t. 21. f. M.\" and \"Pet. Gaz. t. 97. f.22.\"\r\nwere found in the manuscript: the printed emendations were, \"magnitudine\r\novi passerini\", \"uti anterius\", and \"granis duobus\" for the earlier\r\n\"punctis.\"\r\n\r\nB. GIBBOSA. _B._ angulata, cingulo elevato.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 249\", \"List. t. 711. f. 64\", \"Pet. Gaz. t. 15. f. 5\", were\r\ncited in the copy: \"præcedentis magnitudine\", \"solidiorque\", with\r\nthe modification of \"cylindrica\" by a preceding \"sub\", were press\r\nemendations.\r\n\r\nB. NAUCUM. _B._ rotundata pellucida.\r\n\r\nThe size was not at first mentioned.\r\n\r\nB. AMPULLA. _B._ rotundata opaca.\r\n\r\nThe printed \"nulla\" replaced the earlier \"descendens, nuda\", and\r\n\"pallido-testacea\" the written \"albida.\" The \"antice, nullus vero\r\npostice\" was an emendation of the press.\r\n\r\nB. PHYSIS. _B._ spira obtusa, lineis crispata.\r\n\r\n\"Sæpe\", \"hiansque\", \"tenue\", and the name, are not to be found in\r\nthe written copy: \"apicem\" was the reading for the printed \"ventrem,\r\naduatum.\"\r\n\r\nB. AMPLUSTRE. _B._ spira elevata, fasciis incarnatis.\r\n\r\nB. PALLIDA. _B._ spira elevata acuta, corpore cylindrico.\r\n\r\nSo very many changes has this puzzling species experienced in the\r\nworks of our author, that it has been thought advisable to transcribe\r\nthe written description from the manuscript copy:--\r\n\r\nTesta ovato-cylindrica, glabra. Spira convexo-conica, mucronata.\r\nColumella multum torta. Color lividus, longitudinaliter grisco\r\nundulatus.\r\n\r\nThis evidently was a very different shell from the four-plaited, pale\r\npink, and often variegated specimen described in the printed copy.\r\nThe description of the outer lip, the name, and the terms \"solida\",\r\n\"lævigata, obsoletior\" were, likewise, additions of the press.\r\n\r\nB. CANALICULATA. _B._ cylindrica lævis, spiræ anfractibus\r\ncanaliculatis.\r\n\r\nThe entire account of this species was added to the manuscript in the\r\nLinnean handwriting.\r\n\r\nB. ACHATINA. _Buc._ glabrum, apertura integra.\r\n\r\n\"Colum. Aphr. 18. t. 16\" was the omitted synonym: \"vel inæqualiter\r\novata\" and the entire account of the base (merely described as \"vix\r\nmanifeste emarginata\") were the printed additions.\r\n\r\nB. AURIS-MIDÆ. _Morion_ ovali-oblongum, spira rugosa, labio interiore\r\nbidentato.\r\n\r\nFigure 122 of Klein's seventh plate was correctly quoted as\r\nillustrative: \"crudæ\" preceded \"niger.\"\r\n\r\nB. AURIS-JUDÆ. _Morion_ oblongus, spira lævi, labio interiore\r\ntridentato.\r\n\r\nB. SOLIDULA. _B._ ovata opaca striata, spira elevata.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt, from the \"ovata\", that _Tornatella flammea_ was the\r\nshell originally here intended; for the inharmonious account of\r\nthe inner lip (as well as of the outer one) was not found in the\r\nmanuscript,--from which, too, the erroneous reference to Bonanni was\r\nat first absent. The \"acutiuscula\" was \"obtusiuscula\": the \"postice\r\nrotundata, antice acuta\" was an improvement upon the earlier \"pone\r\ngibba.\"\r\n\r\nB. LIVIDA. _B._ spira elevata obtusa, corpore cylindrico.\r\n\r\nThis heading makes no mention of the columellar plication of the\r\nshell so named in the 'Systema,' and confirms my surmise of their\r\ndistinctiveness. The name _livida_ was not originally attached to the\r\ndescription, but had been added (together with \"obsoletis\") by Linnæus,\r\nfrom a mistaken identification.\r\n\r\nThere has evidently been some error in the comparison with _Voluta\r\nCaffra_. I suspect that _Conus bullatus_ was meant, as the contrasting\r\ncharacters answer admirably. \"Differt a _B. pallida_ et _livida_, quod\r\ntesta solida--anfractus spiræ canaliculati\". This passage shows that\r\n\"fragilis et spiræ anfractus obtusæ\" referred to _livida_, not to\r\n_Caffra_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUTA.\r\n\r\nTesta oblonga, subconvexa, basi emarginata, replicata in canalem rectum.\r\nColumella plicata oblique. Labio integro.\r\n\r\nThe genus appears to comprehend precisely the same members as in the\r\npublished edition. They were arranged in sections exactly corresponding\r\nwith the Lamarckian genera of _Oliva_, _Voluta_, _Mitra_, and\r\n_Marginella_.\r\n\r\nV. PORPHYRIA. _V._ spira basi obliterata, labio medio retuso.\r\n\r\nLinnæus spoilt his excellent earlier description by his attempted\r\nemendations. The interpolated \"Faux sæpius rufescens\" (misprinted\r\nvirescens), and the reference to Gualtieri's figure O. (_O.\r\nerythrostoma_), formed no part of the original version.\r\n\r\nThe \"Varictas fere sola est _V. Olivæ_\" was an afterthought.\r\n\r\nV. OLIVA. _V._ spiræ basi reflexa.\r\n\r\nThe synonyms were thus distributed. To var _a_, Rumph. t. 39. f. 2, and\r\nGualt. t. 23. f. B; to var. _g_, Rumph. t. 39. f. 3; to var. _e_, Arg.\r\nt. 16. f. R; to var. _d_ (\"Cæsius atro-undatus,\" not \"Fusco undulatus\"\r\nas printed), Rumph. t. 39. f. 4. The expressions \"ponderosa\" and \"magis\r\nsulcatum\" were not in the original.\r\n\r\nV. ISPIDULA. _V._ spira adscendente, margine unico.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 59. f. 8,\" cited in the 'Systema,' was also written in the\r\nmanuscript: not so the \"Varietas forte præcedentis _V. Olivæ_.\" None of\r\nthe drawings exhibit the produced spire, which must have resembled that\r\nof _O. jaspidea_. The earlier name was _ispida_.\r\n\r\nV. GLABELLA. _V._ ovata lævis, labii margine reflexo, basi rotundata.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Gualtieri (a doubtful figure) was not originally\r\ninserted. The intended name was _V. polita_.\r\n\r\nV. CAFFRA. _V._ fusiformis lævis.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of asserting, in relation to this and the next species,\r\nthat each resembled the other, but was larger, arose from the\r\ncircumstance that when our author, in revising the labours of his\r\namanuensis, added \"sed major,\" he omitted to erase it from the following\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nV. VULPECULA. _V._ fusiformis angulata inermis, transversim striata.\r\n\r\nOf the ample details the first two paragraphs only were found in the\r\nmanuscript. The proposed name was _V. picta_.\r\n\r\nV. PLICARIA. _V._ fusiformis, angulis antice subspinosis.\r\n\r\nThe intended appellation _angulata_ was changed from an erroneous\r\nimpression of the identity of the species with the _Turricula plicata_\r\nof Rumphius. \"Mucronatis\" and \"albidus\" were emendations. \"Bonan. 8.\r\nf. 65\" was referred to, as in the 'Systema'.\r\n\r\nV. PERTUSA. _V._ fusiformis, labro denticulato, striata punctis\r\npertusis.\r\n\r\n_V. denticulata_ was the name originally proposed for this _Mitre_.\r\n\r\nV. MITRA. _V._ fusiformis lævis, labro denticulato.\r\n\r\nThe final paragraph was not in the manuscript, where \"Bonan. 3. t.\r\n119, 120\", and \"Klein, 36. Mitra episcopi\", the former cited in the\r\n'Systema', the latter a mere name, were quoted as illustrative.\r\n\r\nV. MUSICA. _V._ spinis obtusiusculis, columella plicis 8.\r\n\r\nThe reference to the letters X. and Y. of Gualtieri (neither of which\r\nare illustrative) stood not thus in the original: the characteristic Z.\r\nof that work was the figure really cited. The printed edition has been\r\nenlarged by an \"ob\" before \"ovato\" the addition of \"solida\", and the\r\ndescription of the lips.\r\n\r\nV. VESPERTILIO. _V._ spinis acutis, columella plicis 4.\r\n\r\nThe only printed additions are \"ob\" before \"ovato\", \"s. glauca\", and\r\n\"fuscis lineis\" in place of the \"saturatius.\"\r\n\r\nV. ÆTHIOPICA. _V._ spinis fornicatis cingentibus apicem papillarem.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat in mari Pacifico\", \"Pet. Amb. t. 7. f. 5\" (copied from\r\nRumphius, t. 31. f. B.), and \"Bonan. t. 3 f. 1\" (cited in the 'Systema')\r\nwere the unprinted additions.\r\n\r\nV. CYMBIUM. The entire account of this shell was in the handwriting of\r\nLinnæus, and inserted at a later period than the mass of species. The\r\ndecided reference to Gualtieri _was not in the manuscript_.\r\n\r\nV. OLLA was not mentioned in the written catalogue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the species published in the 'Museum,' the following were\r\nalso characterized in the manuscript:--\r\n\r\nV. FABA. _V._ ovata, antice subplicata, labii exterioris margine\r\nreflexo, basi rotundata.\r\n\r\nBonan. 3. f. 49.\r\n\r\nTesta magnitudine vix fabæ, ovalis, lævis, antice subplicata, livida,\r\npunctis fuscis aspersa. Spira testæ 1/2 brevior, subplicata. Labium\r\nexterius reflexum, basi rotundatum integrum.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently the shell so designated in the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nV. GRANULATA. _V._ fusiformis, sulcis longitudinalibus, striisque\r\ntransversalibus.\r\n\r\nRumph. Mus. t. 29. f. V.\r\n\r\nArg. Conch. t. 12. f. V.\r\n\r\nTesta facie antecedentis, sed sulci et striæ contrariæ, fusiformis,\r\nsulcis longitudinalibus elevatis obtusis, striis transversalibus\r\nexaratis. Color cinereus, fasciis linearibus 2 rubris ex punctis. Spira\r\nlongitudine ventris. Apertura præcedentis.\r\n\r\nThis was the _V. sanguisuga_ of the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nThe preceding species referred to was\r\n\r\nV. LIMA. _V._ fusiformis, sulcis transversis, striisque\r\nlongitudinalibus.\r\n\r\nRumph. Mus. t. 28. f. T.\r\n\r\nTesta fusiformis, scabriuscula, striis longitudinalibus secundum testam,\r\net sulcis secundum anfractus adscendentibus margine acutiusculis. Color\r\nalbidus sulcis elevatis rubris--albidus sulcis elevatis flavis albo\r\ninterruptis. Spira longitudine ventris. Apertura oblonga, intus alba.\r\nBasis acuta, emarginata. Labium exterius integrum; interius nullum.\r\nColumella dentibus 4 obliqius.\r\n\r\nThese features fairly enough suit the _Mitra filosa_, generally, and\r\nwith reason, supposed to be the _V. filaris_ of the 'Mantissa.' The\r\ncited figure however, seems _M. gracilis_ of Reeve.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCCINUM.\r\n\r\nThe species which compose this group in the 'Museum' were originally\r\nseparated under many generic designations.\r\n\r\n1. BUCCINUM. Testa ovata, ventricosa. Apertura integra, semilunaris,\r\nsuperne extrorsum, postice introrsum.\r\n\r\n2. CASSIDA. Testa ovata, gibba. Cauda reflexa oblique. Apertura\r\nlongitudinalis, obliqua.\r\n\r\n3. LYRA. Testa ovata, ventricosa. Apertura ovata, patens, pone\r\nsubmarginata. Labium interius nullum. Columella compressa, nitida.\r\n\r\n4. TURRICULA. (No definition: evidently intended for all the turreted\r\nshells.)\r\n\r\n5. MORION. Testa oblonga, inermis. Apertura oblonga, labio interiore\r\nreflexo unidentato.\r\n\r\nIn the first were located the _Dolia_, and _B. echinophorum_; in the\r\nsecond the _Cassides_, with _B. papillosum_ and _arcularia_; in the\r\nthird the _Harpæ_ and _Purpuræ_; in the fourth the _Terebræ_; in the\r\nfifth _B. glans_, _spiratum_, _glabratum_.\r\n\r\n_B. undosum_ was located in _Murex_.\r\n\r\nB. PERDIX. _B._ umbilicatum subsulcatum, basi recta.\r\n\r\nThe proposed name was _B. pennatum_, adopted from Rumphius:\r\n\"lunari-patula\" was not in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nB. POMUM. _B._ exumbilicatum, labio utroque dentato.\r\n\r\n\"Barr. Ic. t. 1325. f. 12\" (cited in the 'Systema'), and \"Klein, 95.\r\nSemicassis, striata, costosa\", were the additional synonyms of the\r\nmanuscript: \"s. sulcata\", \"nullum, interne\", \"at vero in adultioribus\r\naccrescit planum album\", were subsequent emendations.\r\n\r\nB. DOLIUM. _B._ emarginatum subsulcatum rugosum, labio exteriore reflexo\r\ndentato.\r\n\r\nThe _Dolium fimbriatum_, or, as Deshayes prefers it, _D. Minjac_ (the\r\nMalay name was Bia Minjac in Rumphius, who preceded Adanson), was\r\nassuredly the shell described in the 'Museum', as the recorded dentation\r\nof the outer lip clearly manifests. An excellent figure of it in Petiver\r\n(\"Gaz. t. 99. f. 11\") was cited in the original copy, where the drawing\r\nof Gualtieri was not referred to.\r\n\r\nB. ECHINOPHORUM. _B._ (changed to _Cassida_) tuberibus (\"quaterna serie\"\r\ninterpolated) nodosum.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Rumphius was correctly written 1, not I, in the\r\noriginal, where \"albido-flavescens\" was the indicated colouring. The\r\nprinted emendations were \"quadruplici s. quintuplici\", instead of\r\n\"triplici\", and the entire account of the aperture, which at first ran\r\nsimply as follows, \"Labium exterius crassius, margine tenuiore, interne\r\nsubrugosum, obsolete dentatum.\"\r\n\r\nB. TUBEROSUM. _B._ tuberibus gemina serie nodosum.\r\n\r\nThe entire published account of this species had been interpolated\r\nby Linnæus in the written copy, with the exception of the \"color\r\npallidus.\" The \"nodis anterioribus\" was a misprint for \"nodis\r\nacutioribus.\"\r\n\r\nGualtieri's admirable figure of the _Cassis tuberosa_ of authors was\r\nnot, however, cited, which confirms my statement that the species of\r\nthe 'Museum' was not the _Cassis_ usually so designated.\r\n\r\nB. CORNUTUM. _Cas._ acuminibus antice cingentibus, superficic\r\nreticulata.\r\n\r\nThe I in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written 1:\r\n\"maculata\" was originally \"maculis griseis.\"\r\n\r\nB. RUFUM. _Cas._ nodis sparsis.\r\n\r\n\"Pyri\" was a misprint for the written \"pugni\". Neither the \"maculis\r\nfuscis\" nor the \"Variat tota albo colore\" were originally present. The\r\nRumphian name _rubra_ was the one written.\r\n\r\nB. FLAMMEUM. _Cas._ longitudinaliter striata, antice subnodosa.\r\n\r\nTo the solitary synonym our author had added \"List. t. 1004. f. 69\" and\r\n\"Sloan. Hist. 2. p. 242. n. 2\". The final remark was not in the copy.\r\n\r\nB. TESTICULUS. _Cas._ lævis, striis longitudinalibus, sulcis\r\ntransversalibus.\r\n\r\n\"Vix ullus\" was at first \"nullus\": \"læve\" was not present.\r\n\r\nB. DECUSSATUM. _Cas._ lævis, striis decussatis, labio exteriore\r\ndentato.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. Clas. 3. t. 157\" was an additional synonym.\r\n\r\nB. AREOLA. _Cas._ glabra, spira papillosa.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous references to Gualtieri, and to the figure 2 of\r\nRumphius, were not present in the original, nor was there any allusion\r\nmade to the sculpture of the inner lip.\r\n\r\nB. ERINACEUS. _Cas._ subsulcata, antice nodosa, labio edentulo,\r\npostice extrorsum denticulato.\r\n\r\nThe entire account of this _Cassis_ was interpolated by Linnæus in the\r\npages of his amanuensis.\r\n\r\nB. GLAUCUM. _Cas._ glabra, antice muricata, labio dentato, postice\r\nextrorsum denticulato.\r\n\r\nThe superfluous A in the reference to Gualtieri was a misprint:\r\n\"inferne\" was \"interne\": the \"acuminata\" and \"marginatum\" were\r\nemendations.\r\n\r\nB. VIBEX. _Cas._ glabra, labio edentulo, postice extrorsum denticulato.\r\n\r\nThe figures 8 and 9 of Rumphius were not cited.\r\n\r\nB. PAPILLOSUM. _Cas._ papillis decussatis, labio tenui, extus\r\ndenticulato, fauce glabra.\r\n\r\n\"Rectum\" followed \"exterius\" in the written copy, wherein \"s. albidus\"\r\nand \"antice sinu excavata\" were not to be found.\r\n\r\nB. GLANS. _Morion_ labio exteriore denticulato, interiore bidentato.\r\n\r\n\"Labium exterius margine postico denticulato\" was omitted in printing.\r\n\r\nB. ARCULARIA. _Cas._ longitudinaliter sulcata, labio exteriore tenui,\r\ninteriore maximo.\r\n\r\nB. COSTATUM. _Lyra_ costis longitudinalibus, antice prominulis,\r\nalternis obsoletis.\r\n\r\nThis diagnosis but ill suits the _Many-ridged Harp_, which, of late,\r\nhas been considered identical.\r\n\r\nB. HARPA. _Lyra_ costis longitudinalibus antice mucronatis.\r\n\r\nThe shell is described in the MS. as \"striata subtilissime\r\nlongitudinaliter\", and \"Pet. Amb. t. 2. f. 2\", \"Pet. Gaz. t. 48. f. 13\"\r\n(the latter quoted also in the 'Systema') are there substituted for the\r\nreference to Gualtieri. The printed additions are considerable; to\r\nwit, \"costæ vero striis transversis\", \"anfractibus costis mucronatis\",\r\n\"denticulatum.\"\r\n\r\nB. PERSICUM. _Lyra_ læviuscula, labii margine crenulato.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous citation of Grew (t. 9. f. 5, 6) in the 'Systema' had\r\nbeen adopted in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nB. PATULUM. _Lyra_ muricata spinis obtusis.\r\n\r\nNeither the erroneous reference to Gualtieri, plate 51. f. A (which\r\nwas designed for _Purpura hæmastoma_), nor the \"color interne\r\nrufescens\", is to be found in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nB. SMARAGDULUS. _Lyra_ glaberrima, columella denticulata.\r\n\r\nNeither the erroneous reference to d'Argenville, nor the specific\r\nname derived from his figure, is to be found in the MS. The proposed\r\nappellation was _L. vitrea_. \"Simillima Cassid, lapillo, sed glabra,\r\net columella crenata\" is the unprinted remark.\r\n\r\nB. SPIRATUM. _Morion_ umbilicatus, anfractibus distinctis canaliculo.\r\n\r\nThe specified colouring was \"alba, maculis longitudinalibus fuscis\";\r\n\"pone bifidum\" followed \"integrum.\" The intended name was _M.\r\ncanaliculatus_.\r\n\r\nB. GLABRATUM. _Morion_ umbilico descendente flexuoso.\r\n\r\nd'Arg. Conch t. 12. f. G.\r\n\r\n\"Testa oblonga, acuminata, obtusiuscula, glaberrima, anfractibus\r\nconfluentibus, Neritarum maximarum pondere. Color albo-flavescens,\r\nnitidus. Apertura obliqua, profunde emarginata. Labium exterius\r\nintegerrimum. Labium interius antice reflexum adnatum, dein solutum\r\nbrevius flexuosum, descendens ad basin. Sulcus profundus distinguit\r\nbasin testæ. Umbilicus pone labium interius descendens ad basin sulco\".\r\n\r\nB. VIRGINEUM. I can find no account of this shell in the written copy.\r\n\r\nB. UNDOSUM. The nearest approach to this species seems the variety B.\r\nof the _Murex succinctus_ (the shell so named in the 'Mantissa').\r\n\r\n_M._ lævis, sulcis transversis lævibus, angulo marginali.\r\n\r\nd'Arg. Conch. t. 12. f. N. Bon. 3. f. 47.\r\n\r\nTesta ovata, absque tuberculis magnitudine nucis, exarata sulcis\r\ntransversis pallidis, eminentibus vero lineis luteis. Spira obtusa,\r\nanfractibus rotundatis. Cauda teretiuscula. Apertura ovata, margine\r\ncrasso, nec alia costa laterali crassa.\r\n\r\nVar. B. Rugis s. angulis obliteratis 5 longitudinalibus.\r\n\r\nB. MACULATUM. _Turricula_ elongata, anfractibus lævibus integerrimis.\r\n\r\nThe l. of Gualtieri, and the reference to d'Argenville, were printed\r\nemendations.\r\n\r\nB. CRENULATUM. _Turric._ elongata, anfractibus margine crenatis.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Gualtieri was an emendation.\r\n\r\nB. STRIGILATUM. _Turric._ elongata, oblique striata.\r\n\r\nB. DUPLICATUM. _Turric._ elongata emarginata, anfractibus bipartitis\r\nstriatis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTROMBUS.\r\n\r\nThis genus, rendered more natural by the omission of _S. lividus_ and\r\n_ater_ (assigned to _Turricula_), appeared under the designation of\r\nHARPAGO with the following definition:--\r\n\r\nTesta depressa, nodosa. Apertura longitudinalis. Labium antice\r\ndilatatum ultra basin.\r\n\r\nThe _Strombi_ of the manuscript were the young of this genus (erased by\r\nLinnæus) and certain Lamarckian _Fusi_, _Pyrulæ_, and _Fasciolariæ_.\r\n\r\nS. CHIRAGRA. _Har._ labii spinis lævibus 6, extimis recurvis, fauce\r\nstriata.\r\n\r\n\"Bar. Icon. 327. f. 1.\" was an additional synonym.\r\n\r\nS. SCORPIUS. _Har._ labii spinis nodosis _7_, fauce striata.\r\n\r\nThe published account was enlarged by the following passages, which are\r\nnot to be found in the written copy: \"crenulato cincta\", \"lato, brevi\",\r\n\"s. incarnata\", \"s. testaceo-nebulosus\". \"Distinctum\" was originally\r\n\"obscuro\", and \"repandus, inflexus\" was \"denticulatus.\"\r\n\r\nS. LAMBIS. _Har._ labii spinis lævibus _7_, fauce lævi.\r\n\r\n\"Bar. Icon. t. 1326. f. _7_\" was the synonym omitted in printing. The\r\nname was borrowed from d'Argenville.\r\n\r\nS. MILLEPEDA. _Har._ labii spinis lævibus 10.\r\n\r\n\"Anteriora\" was \"posteriora\" in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nS. LENTIGINOSUS. _Har._ labio inermi integro rotundato, angulis\r\npluribus nodosis.\r\n\r\nThe \"aut marginatum\" was \"fragile, diaphanum\", so that a young shell\r\nappears to have furnished the materials for description.\r\n\r\nS. GALLUS. _Har._ labio inermi mucronato, cingulo dorsali spinoso.\r\n\r\nS. AURIS-DIANÆ. _Har._ labio inermi muricato, cauda recurva, lobo\r\nincurvato.\r\n\r\nThe \"32. f. II.\" was a misprint for the written \"17. f. O.\" The\r\nprinted additions are \"usque\" and \"Color testaceo et albido nebulosus.\"\r\n\r\nS. PUGILIS. _Har._ labio inermi obtuso, spira spinosa distincta, basi\r\nemarginata.\r\n\r\n\"Nitida\", and \"sed spira albida\", were not found in the original.\r\n\r\nS. LUHUANUS. _Har._ labio obtuso, antice posticeque emarginata.\r\n\r\nFew of the details were present in the original copy, but appear\r\nto have been added, to discriminate the species from the allied\r\n_gibberulus_. \"Spira obtusa brevis\" was added by the hand of Linnæus;\r\n\"sæpe subplicati\", \"postice lobo obsoleto instructum\", \"intus\",\r\n\"Columella nigricans\", \"Cauda nulla, sed postice emarginata\", were all\r\nabsent from the MS.\r\n\r\nS. GIBBERULUS. _Har._ labio inermi dorso lævi, spira repanda.\r\n\r\nThe printed additions are \"subtus planiuscula\", \"læves\", \"fuscum\", and\r\nthe final remark.\r\n\r\nS. LATISSIMUS. _Har._ labio inermi rotundato, spira subnodosa\r\nbreviore, dorso lævi.\r\n\r\nS. EPIDROMIS. _Har._ labio inermi dilatato, dorso lævi, spira\r\nsubnodosa.\r\n\r\nThe _S. epidromis_, as it originally stood in the manuscript, was a\r\nrecognizable species, and precisely identical with the shell so named\r\nin the 'Systema'; for the erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not\r\npresent, neither was \"carinato,\" nor any of the discordant details\r\nfrom \"interius\" to the termination. As the printed description now\r\nstands, it would suit _S. emarginatus_ or _succinctus_, at the least,\r\nequally well. I doubt not our author, when correcting the press,\r\nforgot his own species, and added the partial essentials of one\r\nspecies to those of another.\r\n\r\nS. CANARIUM. _Har._ labio inermi dilatato, dorso spiraque lævibus.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to plate 37 of Rumphius was not present in the\r\nwritten copy, which contains the additional synonyms of \"Pet. Gaz.\r\nt. 98. f. 11\", and \"Klein, t. 4. f. 73\": the latter was not there\r\noriginally. The early description has been improved, in the press, by\r\nthe addition of \"obovata\", \"Faux lævis, alba\", and \"longitudinaliter\r\nsubundulatus.\"\r\n\r\nS. VITTATUS. _Har._ labiis inermibus, spiræ anfractibus vitta\r\ninterstinctis.\r\n\r\nS. URCEUS. _Har._ labiis inermibus striatis, dorso nodoso.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not present in the original,\r\nbut in place of it the 37. W. of Rumphius (_S. mutabilis_): \"Spira\r\ntesta brevior, plicato-subnodosa\" was, likewise, absent. \"Klein,\r\n49, urceus fimbriatus\" (a name for Rumph. t. 37. f. F & W) was\r\ninterpolated by our author.\r\n\r\nS. ATER. _Turricula_ labiata.\r\n\r\nNeither the reference to Rumphius, nor the \"et postice emarginatum\"\r\nwere found in the original. This confirms my expressed belief that the\r\nMuseum species (to which no name was at first attached) was distinct\r\nfrom that of the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nS. LIVIDUS. _Turric._ labiata, anfractibus serie subspinosa.\r\n\r\nThis was located in a section of _Turricula_ distinguished as having\r\nthe outer lip dilated and rounded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides the above, the following unprinted details were found in the\r\nmanuscript:--\r\n\r\nThe _Strombus gigas_ was described at length under the appellation of\r\n_Harpago gigas_.\r\n\r\n_Har._ labio inermi rotundato, dorso spiraque subulato-spinosis.\r\n\r\nGualt. t. 34. f. A. Bar. Icon. 1727. f. 7.\r\n\r\nTesta gibba, maxima, magnitudine capitis. Cauda obtusa. Spira spinis\r\npatentibus, subulatis, validis. Anfractus desinens in dorso spina.\r\nSeries in dorso spinarum maximarum ferme conicarum. Labium dilatatum,\r\nrotundatum, spira longius, vix adnatum spiræ. Faux glabra, nitida,\r\nincarnata. Color pallidus.\r\n\r\nThe _Strombus dentatus?_ was also defined (without a specific\r\nappellation) by the following characters:--\r\n\r\n_Har._ labio dentato, testa lævis, plicato-nodosa.\r\n\r\nTesta simillima reliquis, longitudine articuli digiti, lævis,\r\nflavescens, subplicata, plicis antice acuminatis nodis. Spira\r\nacutiuscula, similiter plicata, nodosa. Labium exterius minus\r\ndilatatum, postice margine dentatum et interne fuscum, striatum.\r\nLabium internum crassum, integrum, læve.\r\n\r\nThe _Strombus palustris_, although not published until the twelfth\r\nedition of the 'Systema,' had been already defined in the 'Museum' as\r\n_Turricula cornea_.\r\n\r\n_Tur._ decussatim rugosa, labio dilatato.\r\n\r\nRumph. 101. t. 30. f. Q. Strombus palustris.\r\n\r\nTesta crassa, rudis, pyramidalis, cornea aut plumbea, anfractibus\r\n12 et ultra, secundum spiras transversim aliquot striis exarata,\r\nlongitudinaliter subplicata, adcoque sine spinis rugosissima. Labium\r\ndilatatum, rotundatum, concavum, edentulum.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUREX.\r\n\r\nThe definition of this genus ran as follows:--\r\n\r\nTesta subovata, spinosa. Apertura coarctata, ovata, desinens in\r\ncanalem tubuloso-conniventem.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently designed for the _Murices_ proper. The other\r\nspecies of the 'Museum' were distributed in the groups of _Cassis_,\r\n_Turricula_, _Bulla_, and _Strombus_. The last was defined as follows;\r\n\"Testa obverse conica, nodosa, labium exterius angulum transversalem\r\nsuperne formans; interius nullum. Columella incurva. Cauda integra.\"\r\n\r\nM. HAUSTELLUM. _M._ caudatus, subinermis, nodosus.\r\n\r\n\"Suturis\" was originally \"costis\". The printed emendations\r\nare \"gibbis, adglutinatis\", \"costati et nodosi\", \"subtus rima\r\nlongitudinali clausa\", \"margine\", and the final remark.\r\n\r\nM. TRIBULUS. _M._ caudatus spinis subulatis trifariis.\r\n\r\n\"Olear. Mus. t. 39. f. 1\" was cited in the transcript, to which\r\nLinnæus had added \"Bonan. 269\" and \"List. t. 902. f. 22\", all which\r\nsynonyms are present in the 'Systema.' The printed additions are\r\n\"suturis 3 longitudinalibus, adglutinatis, incrassatis\", \"secundum\r\nsuturas: superficies transversim striis elevatis distinctis\", \"recta\".\r\n\r\nM. CORNUTUS. _M._ caudatus, spinis subulatis serie gemina.\r\n\r\nThe s. in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written\r\n5: \"Pet. Gaz. t. 68. f. 12\" (as in the 'Systema') was present in the\r\ncopy. The expressions \"striata\", \"conicæ\", \"obliquo situ\", and the\r\nfinal remark, are the printed additions.\r\n\r\nM. TRUNCULUS. _M._ subcaudatus, spinis simplici serie.\r\n\r\nThe description of the tail and account of the variety were\r\nnot originally present: \"suturis\" was, at first, \"plicis\", and\r\n\"adglutinatis\" was \"antrorsum adnatis\".\r\n\r\nM. RAMOSUS. _M._ dædaleus triangularis, spira longitudine ventris.\r\n\r\nHad the original manuscript been printed, the multitude of species\r\nconfused under this appellation would have been somewhat lessened. For\r\nthe cited figures of _M. inflatus_ (Rumph. t. 26. f. A. and Gault. t.\r\n38. f. A), with that of another short-spired _Murex_ (Arg. t. 19. f.\r\nC), were separated from the rest, and quoted for a _M. unguis-odor_,\r\nthe brief definition of which was \"_M._ dædalens triangularis, spira\r\nventre breviore.\"\r\n\r\nThe published details, and the drawings of the longer-spired and more\r\nslender-bodied _Murices_ (Rumph. t. 26. f. l; d'Arg. t. 19. f. E, H.),\r\nappeared as _M. lichenoides_.\r\n\r\nI consider, then, that in that event the _M. adustus_ (Arg. t. 19.\r\nf. H.), which would tolerably suit the definition, would have been\r\nconsidered the typical form, and _M. axicornis_ (Rumph. t. 26. f. l,\r\nand d'Arg. t. 19. f. E.), the variety γ.\r\n\r\nM. SCORPIO. _M._ dædaleus quadrangularis, spira subcapitata.\r\n\r\nThe ill-judged final remark was not in the copy.\r\n\r\nM. SAXATILIS. _M._ dædaleus quinquangularis, spira contigua.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this being a mere variety was not expressed in the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nM. RANA. M. angulatus subdepressus, costis lateralibus.\r\n\r\nThe R. of d'Argenville was properly referred to the variety B. The\r\n\"alba\", \"sulcis transversis\", and \"Dorsum anfractum simplici cingulo\r\naculeato\" were not in the copy.\r\n\r\nM. LAMPAS. _M._ angulatus tuberculis nodosis, cauda flexuosa, labio\r\ninteriore lævi.\r\n\r\nThe earlier reading of \"una alterave ruga\" was \"uno alterove\r\ndenticulo.\"\r\n\r\nM. FEMORALE. _M._ angulato-triqueter: angulis antrorsum acuminatis.\r\n\r\nThe intended name was _M. triqueter_. Grew's engravings (f.\r\n7, 8) of the species were correctly cited, and the erroneous\r\nreference to Rumphius was not inserted. The printed additions were\r\nunimportant--\"exarata\", \"repando\", \"sub\" before \"edentula\", and\r\n\"levissime\".\r\n\r\nM. LOTORIUM. _M._ angulatus, tuberculis conicis, cauda flexuosa, labio\r\ninterno rugoso.\r\n\r\n\"Subter\" was a misprint for the written \"inter\": the \"ut in proximis\"\r\nwas a printed addition.\r\n\r\nM. RUBECULA. _M._ angulatus, sulcis moniliformibus, costis lateralibus,\r\ndorsalique.\r\n\r\n\"Gualt. t. 49. f. I\" was rightly cited as illustrative: \"ex\" preceded\r\n\"lineis\".\r\n\r\nM. RETICULARIS. _Cas._ inæqualis gibba reticulata, cauda elongata.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to Rumphius was not present in the manuscript.\r\nAs corroborative of my expressed belief in the identity of the\r\nspecies described in the 'Museum' with the _Triton ! mulus_, it may\r\nbe observed, that our author has wholly separated this and the allied\r\n_anus_ from the true _Tritons_ and _Ranellæ_, and that the original\r\nheading corresponds accurately with the peculiar characteristics.\r\n\r\nM. ANUS. _Cas._ inæqualis, gibba nodosa, labris rugosis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 74. f. 9\" and \"Pet. Amb. t. 6. f. 4\" were the unprinted\r\nsynonyms. The \"rugis reticulato-intertextis\", \"irregularis\", and\r\n\"patens\" were emendations.\r\n\r\nM. RICINUS. _M._ ecaudatus, ore utrinque dentato.\r\n\r\n\"Æqualibus, ad labium majoribus\" was not in the copy.\r\n\r\nM. CAPITELLUM. _M._ ecaudatus ovatus, columella rugosa, labio edentulo,\r\nsuperficie inermi rugosa.\r\n\r\n\"Alba\" followed \"edentula\", and \"Umbilicus ad basin\" terminated the\r\ndescription in the original: the word \"striis\" was a subsequent\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nM. TURBINELLUS. _M._ ecaudatus, turbinatus, columella dentata, spinis\r\nexplicatis.\r\n\r\nThe printed additions are \"anteriores\", \"nodulosa\", \"alba\", \"Cauda vix\r\nulla\", and \"Variat colore albo spira longiore\".\r\n\r\nM. CERAMICUS. _M._ ecaudatus, utrinque acuminatus, columella dentata,\r\nspinis conicis.\r\n\r\n\"Rumph. t. 49. f. L.\" was an unpublished synonym.\r\n\r\nM. NODUS. _M._ ecaudatus ovatus, labio denticulato.\r\n\r\nAs \"Gualt. t. 28. f. R.\" was quoted, and \"aut nigris, conicis,\r\nobtusiusculis\" (a character which probably belonged to some distinct\r\nspecies erroneously supposed to be a variety) was not inserted in the\r\nmanuscript, I feel convinced that the _Purpura hystrix_ of authors was\r\nthe species designed in the 'Museum Ulricæ.'\r\n\r\nM. HYSTRIX. _M._ ecaudatus edentulus, fauce lævi.\r\n\r\nM. MANCINELLA. _M._ ecaudatus, edentulus fauce striata.\r\n\r\nThis original heading, and the absence of the erroneous synonym from\r\nthe MS., confirm the received opinion of the identity of the Museum\r\nspecies (not that of the 'Systema') with _Purpura mancinella_.\r\n\r\nM. HIPPOCASTANUM. _M._ ecaudatus edentulus, fauce edentula integra,\r\nspinis serie triplici.\r\n\r\nGualtieri's erroneously cited figure was not indicated in the\r\nmanuscript. No specific name had been originally attached to the\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nM. MELONGENA. _M._ ecaudatus edentulus fauce patula lævi, spinis serie\r\nduplici.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 3. f. 186\" had been added to the synonymy by our author. The\r\ndetails were less copious than in the published edition, \"apice solo\r\nacuminatus\" being the meagre substitute for the entire description\r\nfrom \"Spira\" to the end.\r\n\r\nM. FICUS. _Bul._ caudata, striis reticulatis, spira obtusa.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 6. f. 9\" was an omitted synonym. The shell described in\r\nthe 'Museum' was assuredly not the _ficus_ of most writers.\r\n\r\nM. RAPA. _Bul._ caudata, striis longitudinalibus, spira acuta.\r\n\r\nM. FUSUS. _Turric._ caudata lævis, labio dentato.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. f. 121\" and the name had been added to the MS. by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nM. BABYLONIUS. _Turric._ caudata, transversim angulo sulcata, labio\r\nmarginali versus basim sinu exciso.\r\n\r\nM. COLUS. _Turric._ caudata striata, labio exteriore crenato.\r\n\r\nThe printed emendations were \"longa\" and \"s. angulati.\" The name was\r\nadded by Linnæus. The following unnamed _Turricula_ succeeded the\r\nspecies in the manuscript copy:--\r\n\r\n_T._ caudata striata, longitudinaliter sulcata.\r\n\r\nTesta parva, striis plurimis secundum anfractus. Anfractus scabri,\r\nsulcis longitudinalibus 15. Color anfractuum superne griseus inferne\r\npallidus. Apertura ovata. Rostrum baseos rectum, testæ dimidio brevius.\r\nLabium tantum exterius integrum. An filia præcedentis?\r\n\r\nM. MORIO. _Strom._ spira subnodosa, labio exteriore intus rugoso.\r\n\r\nThe synonymy, as might be expected (for Seba was unknown to Linnæus\r\nwhen the descriptions were written), was not in the original.\r\n\r\nM. COCHLIDIUM. _Strom._ spira pyramidata, anfractibus planis.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Seba, the name, and the \"Cauda subulata, longitudine\r\ntestæ\" were not present.\r\n\r\nM. CANALICULATUS. _Strom._ spira subconvexa, anfractibus distantibus.\r\n\r\nThe \"Anfractus distincti canaliculo per omnes spiras,\" the name, and\r\nthe reference to Seba, were the printed additions. \"Habitat in Canada.\r\nKalm.\" was appended.\r\n\r\nM. ARUANUS. _Strom._ incurvus spinosus ventricosus, angulo obsoleto.\r\n\r\nThe objectionable name (for assuredly the _Buccinum Aruanum_ of\r\nRumphius suits not \"spinosus\") was not present in the original, but\r\nhad subsequently been added by our author, who seems to have erased\r\nthe original \"Habitat in Canada. Kalm.\" I doubt not that _Pyrula\r\ncarica_ was intended.\r\n\r\nM. PERVERSUS. _Strom._ inversus.\r\n\r\nThe wretched engraving of Gualtieri was not cited.\r\n\r\nM. TRITONIS. _Cas._ pyramidalis lævis, columella dentata.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 3. f. 188\" stood in the place of Seba. The printed additions\r\nwere \"plerisque\", \"et suturis variis alternis crassis\", and the\r\nspecific epithet. \"Genus difficile eruitur\" was written after the\r\ndescription, and the following note erased:--\"Ad genus retuli ob labium\r\ninterius adnatum in quibusdam latius, ob suturas verrucosas, ob caudam\r\ncanaliculatam parum elevatam, ob labium postice dentatum, quæ omnia\r\naffinitatem arguunt.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Triton nodiferus_ was probably designed by the following\r\ndescription, which succeeded that of _M. Tritonis_:--\r\n\r\n_Cas._ (corrected by Linnæus to _Murex_) _Neptuni_. _C._ pyramidalis\r\nnodosa, columella dentata.\r\n\r\nTesta maxime facie statura et colore præcedentis. Anfractuum angulus\r\nsummus nodis prominentibus, unde et spira nodosa evadit, quod non in\r\npræcedente. Apertura præcedentis. Labium interius magis dilatatum,\r\nmaximeque planum. Columella non dentata. Habitat Constantinopoli. Edw.\r\nCarleson.\r\n\r\nM. TRAPEZIUM. _Strom._ spira nodosa, labio denticulato, columella\r\nrugosa.\r\n\r\nM. ALUCO. _Turric._ recurvirostra, spinosa, serie simplici.\r\n\r\nGualtieri was not cited, and the reference was to \"N. Strombus\r\ntuberosus\" (_Cerithium aluco_), not O. (_C. nodulosum_) of Rumphius.\r\nThe inner lip was described as \"non adnatum, sed prominens\": \"s.\r\nfuscis\", and \"Variat cauda recta, &c.\", were not in the original.\r\n\r\nBesides the published species, the following had been written, but\r\nomitted in printing:--\r\n\r\nTURRICULA ALBA. _T._ alba recurvirostra, anfractibus margine crenulatis.\r\n\r\nBon. 3. t. 84. Rumph. t. 30. f. K. Pet. Gaz. t. 56. f. 4. d'Arg. Conch.\r\nt. 14. f. P. Gualt. Test. t. 57. f. D.\r\n\r\nTesta lævis. Anfractus circiter 15, margine subcrenati. Color albus,\r\nsæpius saturatior ad marginem anfractuum. Apertura ovata, rostro\r\ncanaliculato, recurvo. Labium interius adnatum, dente unico obsoleto.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently identical, from its synonymy, with the _M. vertagus_\r\nof the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nTURRICULA SENTICOSA. _T._ reflexo-emarginata, costis reticulatis.\r\n\r\nd'Arg. Conch. t. 12. f. O.\r\n\r\nTesta gibba, costis sæpius 12 perpendiculari-obliquis, intertextis\r\nstriis lamellosis transversis ad anastomosases muricatis, unde admodum\r\nscabra evadit. Anfractus ventricosi, sæpius x. Color griseus. Apertura\r\novata, interne striata, emarginata, parum reflexa.\r\n\r\nEvidently this was identical with the _M. senticosus_ of the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nM. OLEAGINEUS. _M._ angulis sulcis inæqualibus, labio interiore\r\nrugoso, costis alternis.\r\n\r\nGualt. Test. t. 49. f. G. d'Arg. Conch. t. 13. f. M.\r\n\r\nHabitus et structura _rubeculæ_, at octies major, nec vivide pictus,\r\nsed colore testaceo fasciis fuscis longitudinalibus. Apertura intus\r\nsaturate crocea, rugis albis.\r\n\r\nApparently this was the _Triton pileare_ of authors,--not the\r\nMediterranean shell (_T. corrugatus_) termed _M. pileare_ in the\r\n'Systema.'\r\n\r\nM. PILEUS HELVETICUS. _M._ angulis rotundatis, tuberculis conicis,\r\napertura utrinque canaliculata.\r\n\r\nd'Arg. Conch, t. 12. f. D. Rumph. t. 28. f. D.\r\n\r\nTesta ovata, admodum inæqualis, adspersa nodis conicis tuberculatis\r\ninæqualibus. Costæ latere antico membranaceæ, primæ 2 oppositæ,\r\nreliquæ alternæ. Color flavus. Apertura hians, antice et postice\r\ncanaliculatæ, faux intus striata. Labium exterius dentatum, intus\r\ndilatato-membranaceum.\r\n\r\nThis suits very fairly the _Triton lampas_ of authors; far better,\r\nindeed, than does the _M. Lampas_ of the 'Museum Ulricæ.'\r\n\r\nM. SUBULATUS. _M._ ecaudatus, pyramidalis.\r\n\r\nTesta subulata instar turris, anfractuum undecim, reticulata\r\nstriis elevatis decussantibus punctis contiguationem eminentibus.\r\nCostæ oppositæ et alternæ. Color albus, maculis flavescentibus.\r\nApertura ovata, Labium exterius crassum, intus dentatum. Interius\r\ndentato-glabrum.\r\n\r\nBoth _Triton! maculosus_ and _Ranella candisata_ approach the ideal\r\nportrait, yet neither of them precisely agrees.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of _Trochus turritus_ our author appears to have first\r\ndescribed his _Murex radula_.\r\n\r\n_Trochus_ exumbilicatus, pyramidatus, anfractibus duplici serie\r\nmuricatis.\r\n\r\nGualt, t. 58. f. F.\r\n\r\nTesta elongata, flavescens s. testacea. Anfractus 16, connexi sutura\r\ncrenulata, dorso duplici serie instructi punctis eminentibus pallidis.\r\nApertura subtetragona, subtus in canalis rudimentum desineus.\r\n\r\nThe _Murex Neritoideus_ of the 'Systema' was thus described.\r\n\r\nLYRA NERITOIDES. _L._ testa nodosa subrotunda.\r\n\r\nGualt.\r\n\r\nTesta crassa, ponderosa, alba cum rubedine tincta, figura Neritæ,\r\nmagnitudine juglandis, cincta anfractibus 5 e nodis obtusis\r\ncrassiusculis. Labium interius depressum, longitudine pictum macula\r\nferruginea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROCHUS.\r\n\r\nTesta conica. Apertura quadrangularis, basi columella contorta, sinu\r\ndescendens.\r\n\r\nThe last five words had been substituted for \"absque sinu evidente.\"\r\n\r\nT. MACULATUS. _T._ contorto-umbilicatus conicus, vertice subnodoso.\r\n\r\nThe printed description and the synonymy are so very dissimilar to the\r\nwritten one, that I entertain no doubt that an early definition of _T.\r\nNiloticus_ (with references to \"Olear. Mus. t. 9. f. 5\" and \"Bonan.\r\n3. f. 102\") was transmuted into that of a granular species, by the\r\naddition of \"quasi granis exasperata,\" &c.\r\n\r\nT. SOLARIS was not mentioned in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nT. PERSPECTIVUS. _T._ crenato-umbilicatus convexus obtusus: margine\r\nacuto.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 3. f. 27, 28\" was quoted, as illustrative: \"costa crenata\" not\r\n\"costa concava\", was the earlier reading.\r\n\r\nT. HYBRIDUS. _T._ crenato-umbilicatus, convexus, undique obtusus.\r\n\r\nThe proposed name was _T. spurius_. The \"absque carina, rotundata\" was\r\n\"absque angulis, glabra\": \"albo, flavoque\" preceded \"variegata\".\r\n\r\nT. PHARAONIUS. _T._ umbilicatus subovatus striatus, punctis globulosis,\r\nlabio dentato.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat in mari rubro, frequens. D. Hasselquist.\" was written: the\r\nfinal remark was absent.\r\n\r\nT. MAGUS. _T._ umbilicatus convexo-conicus nodosus.\r\n\r\nThe \"cinereo nebulosa\" was a manuscript emendation by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nT. MURICATUS. Except that \"obverse\" precedes \"ovata\", both the\r\ndiagnosis and the details are precisely similar to the printed account.\r\n\r\nT. SCABER. _T._ umbilicatus subovatus, sulcis alternis majoribus\r\nmoniliformibus.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous figure of d'Argenville was not cited in the original,\r\nnor, indeed, was any name attached to the description. The whorls were\r\nsaid to number from 6 to 8 (not 4 or 5); and the aperture was termed\r\n\"ovata,\" not \"subrotunda.\" \"Pallida\", the final remark, and the present\r\nconstruction and enlargement of the passage relative to the inner lip\r\n(which at first ran thus, \"Labium posticum coadunatum, sinu postico\r\nexcisum\"), had been added by Linnæus himself.\r\n\r\nT. LABIO. _T._ exumbilicatus ovatus striato-tuberculatus, labio\r\ndentato.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous figure of d'Argenville was not cited; \"variegata\"\r\nwas the earlier reading of \"marmorata\"; \"aliquot\" of \"et punctis\";\r\n\"externo\" of \"margine\". Linnæus himself had enlarged the account of\r\nthe inner lip from the earlier \"postice sinu excisum\" to its present\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nT. ZIZYPHINUS. _T._ umbilicatus conicus, striis papillosis.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly not the imperforated _zizyphinus_ of the 'Systema.'\r\nGualtieri was not referred to; \"ambitu marginati\", and \"in aliis\r\nclausus\", were not in the copy: \"columella parum obliqua\" was an\r\naddition in the Linnean handwriting.\r\n\r\nT. TELESCOPIUM. _T._ exumbilicatus pyramidatus, striis exaratus; labio\r\npostice recurvato, spirali, integro.\r\n\r\n\"Bon. 92\", and \"Klein 26. Pseudotrochus striatus\", were the additional\r\nsynonyms of the MS.\r\n\r\nT. DOLABRATUS. _T._ umbilicatus, labio postico recurvato sulcato,\r\novato-pyramidalis, glaber.\r\n\r\nThe whorls were at first called imbricated. The \"basis rotundata\", and\r\n\"in superioribus vero unica\", had been added by Linnæus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURBO.\r\n\r\nTesta conica. Apertura orbicularis, integra.\r\n\r\nT. PERSONATUS. _T._ exumbilicatus inermis convexus, labio postice\r\ndiducto.\r\n\r\nThe I of the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written\r\n1. A drawing of Gualtieri (t. 64. f. O), which accords not with the\r\ndescription of this species, was an additional synonym. The name had\r\nbeen added subsequently. _Turbo cidaris_ agrees in most respects.\r\n\r\nT. PETHOLATUS. _T._ exumbilicatus ovatus lævis, anfractibus sursum\r\nobsolete angulatis.\r\n\r\nThe written version furnishes us with the additional synonyms of \"Gualt.\r\nt. 64. f. F.\", and \"Klein 40. t. 2. f. 51.\"; the latter (also cited\r\nin the 'Systema') was added by our author when he admitted the at\r\nfirst excluded 5. 6 of the synonym of Rumphius. The admission of the\r\nrounded-whorled variety? was evidently an afterthought.\r\n\r\nT. CHRYSOSTOMUS. _T._ exumbilicatus subovatus rugosus striatus, spinis\r\nfornicatis.\r\n\r\n\"Klein 41. t. 7. f. 126\" (cited in the 'Systema'), and the printed \"in\r\nsuperiore serie majoribus\", had been added by Linnæus in the original\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nT. TECTUM-PERSICUM. _T._ exumbilicatus subovatus, spinis obtusis\r\nreflexis, subtus papillosus.\r\n\r\n\"Forte sola varietas sequentis a loco\" has been remarked by our author,\r\nwho did not admit in his MS. the deceptive figure of d'Argenville.\r\n\r\nT. PAGODUS. _T._ exumbilicatus conicus spinis obtusis concatenatis,\r\nsubtus papillose striatus.\r\n\r\nNeither \"acuminata\", nor the inappropriate \"rotundata\", were in the\r\noriginal account of this well-known species.\r\n\r\nT. CALCAR. _T._ exumbilicatus depressus, anfractibus supra spinis\r\nfornicato-compressis scabris.\r\n\r\nTo his printed synonyms Linnæus has added \"Gualt. t. 65. f. N. P.\",\r\n\"List. Hist. t. 608. f. 46\", and \"Klein t. 1. f. 27\". The \"fornicatis\"\r\nwas an emendation.\r\n\r\nT. MARMORATUS. _T._ exumbilicatus subovatus nodosus lævis.\r\n\r\nT. PICA. _T._ umbilicatus lævis conicus denticulo umbilicali.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat in Barbados, Jamaica\", which corrects the stated locality of\r\nthe 'Systema,' and \"Bonan. 29, 30\", \"Pet. Gaz. t. 70 f. 9\", were the\r\nadditional particulars of the manuscript copy.\r\n\r\nT. ARGYROSTOMUS. _T._ umbilicatus subovatus, striatus lineis dorsalibus.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous references to Gualtieri and d'Argenville, were not\r\npresent: \"os argenteum variegatum\" was written after the reference to\r\nRumphius, which name belongs to figure 3, not to 4, whose colouring,\r\nmoreover, excludes it from being illustrative. The intended specific\r\nname was \"os variegatum.\"\r\n\r\nT. MARGARITACEUS. _T._ exumbilicatus subovatus, (? angulo) dorsali\r\nelevato, ore postice diducto.\r\n\r\nRumphius was not referred to in the original, where \"subtilissimis\" was\r\nin the place of \"variis\": the printed \"margine albo\" was a subsequent\r\nemendation.\r\n\r\nT. DELPHINUS. _T._ umbilicatus depressus hispidus, spinis ramosis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 3. f. 1\", and \"Grew Mus. t. 11. f. 5, 6\", were also cited.\r\n\r\nT. DISTORTUS. _T._ umbilicatus muricatus undique spinulis brevibus.\r\n\r\nThe final remark was not in the original.\r\n\r\nT. SCALARIS. _T._ cancellatus conicus, anfractibus distantibus.\r\n\r\n\"Pretium immensum, sæpe 100 ducatorum\", was the final remark instead\r\nof the printed one. \"Pet. Amb. t. 2. f. 9\", was an additional synonym\r\nin the written version.\r\n\r\nT. CLATHRUS. _T._ cancellatus pyramidatus, anfractibus contiguis\r\nlævibus.\r\n\r\nAll the synonyms of the tenth edition of the 'Systema,' together with\r\n\"Johnst. t. 11. f. 9\", were present in the MS., but most of them,\r\ntogether with the final remark, had been subsequently added to the\r\ncopy by our author.\r\n\r\nT. CRENATUS. _T._ cancellatus pyramidatus, anfractibus contiguis supra\r\ncrenatis.\r\n\r\nThe details of the 'Museum' were referred to before their publication.\r\n\"Pyramidalis\" was the earlier reading for \"turrita\"; \"sæpe\" was\r\nabsent: \"transversim\" preceded \"crenati.\"\r\n\r\nT. UVA. _T._ cancellatus ovatus, anfractibus contiguis imbricatis.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 27. f. 2. Olivaris\" was the unpublished additional\r\nsynonym, and the intended name was borrowed from that work.\r\n\"Longitudinalibus\" was \"transversis\" in the copy, where \"ut latus\r\nplanum non conspiciatur exterius distincta linea\" terminated the\r\naccount of the volutions: the colouring (\"alba\") was not indicated.\r\n\r\nT. CORNEUS. _T._ umbilicatus, anfractibus teretibus decussatim\r\nstriatis, oris margine reflexo.\r\n\r\nThe \"s. cornea\", the name, and the \"vix manifeste\" had been added to\r\nthe original account, which latter was referred to previous to its\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nT. IMBRICATUS. _T._ pyramidalis, anfractibus deorsum subimbricatis.\r\n\r\nThe \"præcedentibus tribus\", here mentioned, were not those which the\r\nspecies now follows, but nos. 358, 359, 360, after which it was placed\r\nin the MS. \"Grisea\" had been added by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nT. REPLICATUS. The entire account of this shell was interpolated in\r\nthe MS. by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nT. ACUTANGULUS. _T._ pyramidalis, sulco unico acuto majore.\r\n\r\nThe last four words of the details were written subsequently to the\r\nearlier description, to which no name was then appended.\r\n\r\nT. DUPLICATUS. _T._ pyramidalis, sulcis 2 acutis.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 3. f. 114\", and \"List. 160. t. 3. f. 7\", were additional\r\nsynonyms; both, however, were quoted in the 'Systema.' The \"color\r\nalbus\", and the term \"obtusiores\", were in the Linnean handwriting.\r\n\r\nT. TEREBRA. _T._ pyramidatus, sulcis 6 acutis.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. 3. f. 115\" was in the place of the doubtful figure of\r\nRumphius; the indicated colouring was simply \"pallida\": the\r\n\"obsoletum\" was an afterthought.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELIX.\r\n\r\nTesta cochleata, lævis. Apertura subrotunda segmento circuli exempto.\r\n\r\nExcept _scarabæus_ and _amarula_, the members of this genus were\r\nlocated in the same group as in the published edition.\r\n\r\nH. SCARABÆUS. _Morion_ ovatus subanceps, labio utroque tridentato.\r\n\r\nThe \"ovata, adeo\" has replaced the earlier \"ita\", and \"angulata\" the\r\noriginal \"articulata\". The account of the aperture was not inserted in\r\nthe manuscript, wherein \"List. Hist. 577. f. 31\" and \"Klein 11. t. 1.\r\nf. 23\", had been inserted in the Linnean handwriting.\r\n\r\nH. LAPICIDA. _H._ marginata perforata convexa carinata.\r\n\r\n\"Cincta\" was a press emendation. The only written synonym was \"Faun.\r\nSuec. 1298\".\r\n\r\nH. OCULUS-CAPRI. _H._ marginata perforata subcarinata.\r\n\r\n\"Pet Gaz. t. 76. f. 6.\" was indicated as a synonym. The name was\r\nLatinized from the \"_l'oeil de bouc_\" of d'Argenville who has,\r\nhowever, represented an utterly different shell.\r\n\r\nH. CAROCOLLA. _H._ submarginata imperforata carinata, labio interiore\r\nrecto.\r\n\r\nD'Argenville's figure was, evidently, not at first considered\r\nsufficiently illustrative to be referred to: it was not cited in the\r\nwritten copy. \"Conicoplaniuscula\" was the reading for \"convexa\",\r\n\"segmento circuli\" (the 1/4 without any sequence was absurd) for\r\n\"semiovata\": the size, as usual, was not given.\r\n\r\nH. CORNU-MILITARE. _H._ marginata imperforata subcarinata, labio\r\ninteriore explanato.\r\n\r\nThe deceptive figure of Gualtieri was not at first cited.\r\n\r\nH. CORNEA. _H._ marginata convexa umbilicata, spira plana.\r\n\r\n\"Faun. Suec. 1304\" was in place of the reference to 'Lister's English\r\nConchology,' a work apparently unknown to our author when he first\r\ndrew up the Museum Catalogue. I doubt the identity of this shell (the\r\nintended name for which was _tabellaris_) with the cornea of the\r\n'Systema.'\r\n\r\nH. CORNU-ARIETIS. _H._ utrinque depressa.\r\n\r\n\"List. Hist. t. 136. f. 40\" was written by our author in the\r\nmanuscript copy.\r\n\r\nH. AMPULLACEA. _H._ subrotunda, sursum ventricosior glabra.\r\n\r\nThe original reading of \"anfractus superne ventricosi\" was \"abdomen\r\nsuperne ventricosius\". The erroneous reference to Gaultieri was not\r\nat first attached to the description. The species of the Museum was\r\nevidently distinct from that of the 'Systema.'\r\n\r\nH. GLAUCA. _H._ subrotunda acuminata, labro postice marginato.\r\n\r\nH. CITRINA. _H._ umbilicata convexa obtusa.\r\n\r\nThe final remark was an afterthought.\r\n\r\nH. ARBUSTORUM. _H._ marginata perforata convexo-acuminata, ore\r\nsuborbiculari, margine duplici, antice elongato.\r\n\r\n\"Faun. Suec. 1295\" was the only synonym; the work of Lister on English\r\nConchology not having been at first known to Linnæus.\r\n\r\nH. UNGULINA. _H._ marginata perforata spiralis convexa, ore\r\nsuborbiculato.\r\n\r\nThe \"Gualt.\" was a misprint for the written \"Rumph.\"\r\n\r\nH. LUTARIA. _H._ ovata-oblonga umbilicata, interne coloratiore.\r\n\r\n\"Habitat frequens in lutosis fluviis, lacubus.\" May not the _Valvata\r\npiscinalis_ be the shell intended?\r\n\r\nH. PERVERSA. _H._ ovato-oblonga subperforata glabra.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 44. f. 7\", and \"Grew. Mus. t. 10. f. 9\" cited in\r\nthe 'Systema', were also referred to in the MS. \"Alba\", and \"in\r\nquibusdam\", were interpolations in the Linnean handwriting: _H.\r\nsulphurata_ was the intended designation.\r\n\r\nH. IANTHINA. _H._ subrotunda obtusa patula diaphana.\r\n\r\nThe entire account of this beautiful shell was written by Linnæus\r\nsubsequently to the labours of his amanuensis: the twelve last\r\nprinted words were not present. The cited figure of Gualtieri was not\r\nadmitted, as a representation, but only alluded to in the final remark\r\nof \"Confer Gualt. t. 64. f. O.\" \"List. Hist. t. 572. f. 23\", and\r\n\"Sloan. Jam. 2. p. 239. t. 1. f. 4\" were indicated as delineations.\r\n\r\nH. NEMORALIS. _H._\r\n\r\n\"Habitat ubique in Europæ nemoribus\", and \"Argen. t. 32. f. 8\", were\r\nthe unprinted additions. Lister's English Conchology was not, of\r\ncourse, mentioned. \"Flavescens\" and \"nigro-purpurascens\", were not in\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nH. HÆMASTOMA. _H._ imperforata subrotunda fusca fascia longitudinali\r\nsubrecta alba, ore purpureo.\r\n\r\nH. DECOLLATA. _H._ elongata lævis truncato-mutilata.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Gaz. t. 66. f. 1\", and \"Habitat in Arabia. Hasselquist. Santa\r\nCruz. Petiv.\" were the unprinted additions. The entire account was in\r\nthe handwriting of our author.\r\n\r\nH. AMARULA. _Nerita_ edentula oblonga, anfractibus multifariam\r\ndenticulatis.\r\n\r\nOur author was evidently puzzled as to the generic position of\r\nthis peculiar-looking shell, for he has written \"Habitu accedit ad\r\nVolutas vespertiliones, ore Helicibus, sed labium interius planum, et\r\naffinitas cum antecedenti fiat, ut hic relinquatur.\" The preceding\r\nshell alluded to was _N. corona_.\r\n\r\nH. NERITOIDEA. _H._ convexa longitudinaliter striata.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not present in the written\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nH. PERSPICUA. _H._ convexo-ovata, labio interiore nullo, apertura ad\r\napicem usque pervia.\r\n\r\nThe then unpublished details of both this and the preceding were\r\nreferred to in the tenth edition of the 'Systema.' Patens was the\r\nproposed specific appellation.\r\n\r\nH. HALIOTOIDEA. _H._ depresso-planiuscula obtusissima, ore ovali\r\ndilatato.\r\n\r\nNone of the cited figures were at first accepted by our author, who\r\nonly added that of Rumphius to the earlier description, and wholly\r\nomitted the rest. \"Transverse\" preceded \"striata\".\r\n\r\n\r\nNERITA.\r\n\r\nTesta subrotunda, obtusa. Labium interius planum, transversim\r\ntruncatum, depressum.\r\n\r\nThe generic arrangement was similar to that of the printed version.\r\n\r\nN. CANRENA. _N._ edentula umbilicata, spira mucronata, labio reflexo\r\nbifido.\r\n\r\nWhen Linnæus first described this shell, under the appellation of\r\n_N. musica_, he did not admit a single one of the cited figures as\r\nillustrative.\r\n\r\nN. GLAUCINA. _N._ edentula convexa, umbilico simplici semiclauso\r\ngibboso dicolore.\r\n\r\nNone of the deceptive figures were at first referred to, but had been\r\nadded at subsequent period; and that of Rumphius again erased. _N.\r\nluteola_ was the intended name.\r\n\r\nN. ALBUMEN. _N._ edentula subrotunda, umbilico teretinsculo.\r\n\r\nThe present heading agrees with the subsequent details, which could\r\nnot be affirmed of the printed one borrowed from the 'Systema.' The\r\nMS., in some degree, clears up the extraordinary confusion in which\r\nthe Linnean species was enveloped. There were two _N. albumens_ in\r\nthe written copy. The shell here described (assuredly not the lobed\r\n_albumen_ of the 'Systema') was originally termed _hepatica_ or\r\n_luteola_ (for both had been erased). The true _albumen_ was described\r\nas \"edentula subrotunda, umbilico subcordato labri interioris lobo\r\nexplanato\" and the only figure referred to was \"Rumph. t. 22. f. B.\"\r\n\"Klein 13. Platystoma vitellum compressum\" was also mentioned. This\r\ndescription was suppressed, and the other species retained, with the\r\nerroneous designation, and the faulty synonymy, attached. Nor was this\r\nthe only change. In order to include the _Natica vitellus_ of authors\r\n(\"Rumph. t. 22. f. A. Valvata lævis prima s. vitellus\" had been quoted\r\nby our author) the \"aut lutea\", \"aut maculis albis\", had been added to\r\nthe earlier description: so, likewise, had been \"Apertura rotundata,\r\nsemicordata\", and \"glabrum, planiusculum, nitidum.\" I suspect, then,\r\nthat whilst the ideal of the _albumen_ of the 'Systema' was any\r\nhemispherical or flattened _Natica_ with a labial lobe (such as _Nat.\r\nalbumen_, _didyma_, _olla_, _&c._), the _albumen_ of the 'Museum', as\r\nprinted, was composed of _Natica rufa_ (\"Rumph. 22. f. D.\" was quoted\r\nin the MS.) and _vitellus_ (for A, not B, of Rumphius was the letter\r\nindicated in the MS.).\r\n\r\nN. MAMMILLA. The entire account of this common shell was added in the\r\nLinnean handwriting. The inappropriate \"aut lutea\" was not at first\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nN. CORONA. _N._ edentula, simplici spira spinosa.\r\n\r\n\"Pet. Amb. t. 3. f. 4.\", a mere copy of the Rumphian figure, was also\r\nquoted. The 19 in the reference to d'Argenville was a misprint for the\r\nwritten 10. _N. spinosa_ was the intended designation.\r\n\r\nN. RADULA. _N._ edentula sulcata, tuberculis æqualibus.\r\n\r\nThe valvata granulata of Rumphius (t. 22. f. M.) was referred to at\r\nillustrative.\r\n\r\nN. CORNEA. _N._ edentula, obsolete striata.\r\n\r\nN. BIDENS. _N._\r\n\r\n\"Obsoletis\" followed \"duobus\": the name had been written subsequent to\r\nthe description.\r\n\r\nN. VIRGINEA. _N._ subedentula ovata lævis.\r\n\r\n\"Dentibus pluribus minutissimis\" preceded \"oris\"; \"Pet. Gaz. t. 11.\r\nf. 3\" was in the place of the delusive figure of d'Argenville: the\r\nvariety d was a subsequent addition.\r\n\r\nN. POLITA. _N._ lævis, labiis dentatis.\r\n\r\nThe 1 in the synonym of Rumphius was a misprint for the written I.\r\n\r\nN. PELERONTA. _N._ striata, labiis dentatis, interiore planiusculo\r\nrugoso.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous synonym was added, along with the name peleronta, to the\r\nwritten details: _N. rufa_ was the original appellation.\r\n\r\nN. ALBICILLA. _N._ striata, labiis subdentatis, interiore tuberculato.\r\n\r\nN. HISTRIO. _N._ sulcata, transversim striata, labio interiore dentato.\r\n\r\nThe name, and the synonym, were added by Linnæus to the written\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nN. PLICATA. _N._ sulcata, labiis profunde dentatis, interiore\r\nrotundato, exteriore utrinque dentibus acutis conicis.\r\n\r\nThe variety alluded to was a subsequent addition. The details of the\r\n'Museum' had been quoted, in anticipation, for this species.\r\n\r\nN. GROSSA. _N._ sulcata labiis dentatis, interiore convexo rugoso.\r\n\r\nN.

UNDATA. _N._ sulcata, labiis dentatis, interiore rugoso,\r\ntuberculato.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous figure of Gualtieri was not cited when the description\r\nwas drawn up, but added to the details, along with \"confluentibus.\r\nSpira acuta prominens\", when the present name was substituted for the\r\nearlier _nebulata_.\r\n\r\nN.

STRIATA. _H._ ovata, transversim rugosa, longitudinaliter striata.\r\n\r\nNo name was attached to either this or any member of the genus, except\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nH.

NERITOIDEA. _P._ integra ovata, apice subspirali, labio laterali.\r\n\r\n\"Supra\" preceded \"convexa\", and the \"fere\" was before \"apice\".\r\n\r\nP.

TUBERCULATA. _P._ dentata conica tuberculata, postice sima.\r\n\r\n_Sima_ was the earlier name in the MS., but was erased by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nP. LUTEA. _P._ integerrima striata, vertice mucronato inflexo.\r\n\r\nP. UNGUIS. _P._ ovali-oblonga, apice emarginata, mucrone dorsali\r\ncarinato.\r\n\r\n_Unguiformis_ was the intended appellation.\r\n\r\nP. TESTUDINARIA. _P._ ovata glaberrima integerrima.\r\n\r\nP.

CRUCIATA. _P._ ovalis convexa integerrima, cruce picta.\r\n\r\nP. RETICULATA. _P._ conica compressa, superficie reticulata.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion I have elsewhere made that this uncertain shell might\r\nprove the European _Pedicularia_, induces me to remark that, although\r\n_P. Sicula_ has been supposed to be a comparatively modern discovery,\r\nFavanne had long ago delineated it in the fourth plate (f. H. 1.) of\r\nhis enlarged edition of d'Argenville.\r\n\r\nP. NIMBOSA. _P._ conica ovalis, costis confertis, vertice perforato.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy between the heading borrowed from the 'Systema', and\r\nthe after details, is removed by the substitution of the original one.\r\nThe shell was termed _perforata_ (not _nimbosa_), and was wrongly\r\nidentified by Linnæus with the striated brown _Fissurella_ of the\r\n'Systema'.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the printed species, the two following were present in\r\nthe manuscript copy.\r\n\r\nP. SOLARIS. _P._ ovata integerrima, striis subnodosis, vertice\r\nacutiusculo.\r\n\r\nTesta ovata, diaphana, magnitudine extimi articuli digiti, margine\r\nintegerrimo, lævis, striis subtilissimis inæqualibus numerosissimis,\r\nfasciis longitudinalibus rubris albo passim maculatis. Mucro\r\nacutiusculus obliquus albidus.\r\n\r\nThis was placed in the section having a simple margin.\r\n\r\nP. PERFOLIATA. _P._ conica, reclinata, perfoliata.\r\n\r\nTesta magnitudine coryli nucis, conica, sed cono retro inclinato,\r\nacutissima, alba, imbricata lamellis horizontaliter testam\r\ncingentibus. Margo integer, ovalis, antrorsum gibbus s. dilatatus.\r\nCavitas profunde glabra.\r\n\r\nThis description very fairly suits the _Patella antiquata_ of the\r\ntwelfth edition of the 'Systema'.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENTALIUM.\r\n\r\nTesta univalvis, subcylindrica, utrinque aperta. Spira regularis nulla.\r\n\r\nAlthough the _Serpulæ_ were intermingled, it is clear that they did\r\nnot accord with the above definition.\r\n\r\nD. ELEPHANTINUM. _D._ subulatum subarcuatum, angulatum.\r\n\r\nThe synonymy of the tenth edition was appended, Lister excepted; the\r\nerroneous 13 of the reference to the Gazophylaceum was erased. _Dens\r\nelephantis_ was the proposed trivial name.\r\n\r\nD. ENTALIS. _D._ subulato-cylindricum, subarcuatum.\r\n\r\nThe terminal details were not furnished.\r\n\r\n_D. dentalium_ was the intended appellation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERPULA.\r\n\r\nIn the original version of the 'Museum Ulricæ,' the members of this\r\ngenus are not separated from the _Dentalia_ (a proof, among many\r\nothers, of the early date of this catalogue). Linnæus, however,\r\nwhen revising the transcript, had meditated the withdrawing of _S.\r\narenaria_ and _lumbricalis_, and constituted for them a nameless genus\r\nwith the following definition:--\r\n\r\nTesta tubulosa, isthmis concamerata, dissepimentis integris, nec\r\nperforatis, s. communicantibus.\r\n\r\nThis genus would have been the equivalent of the modern _Vermetus_.\r\n\r\nS. TRIQUETRA. _D._ triquetrum, adhærens.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Gualtieri (whose figure was somewhat uncertain, yet\r\nprobably designed for _Vermilia triquetra_) was queried. The proposed\r\nname was _D. parasiticum_.\r\n\r\nS. CONTORTUPLICATA. _D._ teretiusculum, depressum, rugosum.\r\n\r\nThere was at first no name to the description of this shell; but it\r\nwas added in the handwriting of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nS. GLOMERATA. _D._ teres glomeratum.\r\n\r\nThe 'decussato-rugosa' of the 'Systema', applicable to the _'Vermetus\r\nsubcancellatus_', the shell designed in that work, was not inserted.\r\nGualtieri's figure is that of _Vermetus glomeratus_, for the colouring\r\nof which 'alba' would be a most inappropriate term.\r\n\r\nS. LUMBRICALIS. _D._ spira divaricata teretiusculum, integrum.\r\n\r\nD'Arg. t. 29. f. 1. was an additional synonym.\r\n\r\nS. ARENARIA. _D._ teres rectiusculum intestiniforme.\r\n\r\nDespite the name borrowed from Rumphius, the _Vermetus gigas_ was the\r\nobject defined in the tenth edition of the 'Systema'. The absence from\r\nthe manuscript of the reference to Gualtieri's drawing of that shell,\r\nand \"rectiusculum\" in the written diagnosis, confirms the conclusion\r\npreviously arrived at, that the _Septaria arenaria_ of authors was\r\nthe species intended in the 'Museum Ulricæ': it was subsequently\r\ntermed _S. polythalamia_ by Linnæus. The delusive \"subangulata\" of the\r\nsupposititious diagnosis was of course absent.\r\n\r\nThe _V. gigas_ was probably intended by the following unpublished\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nD. INTESTINIFORME. _D._ teres flexuosum intestiniforme.\r\n\r\nTesta rudis crassitie digiti et ultro, flexuosa vario modo in diversis,\r\nintegra, intus lævis.\r\n\r\nS. ANGUINA.\r\n\r\nThe two very dissimilar _Siliquariæ_ united under this appellation\r\nin the 'Museum Ulricæ,' were originally held distinct. The prickly\r\nvariety was the unpublished type, and was thus defined:--\r\n\r\nD. ANGUINUM. _D._ spira inæquali angulata aculeata, sulco\r\nlongitudinali perforata.\r\n\r\nRumph. 125. t. 41. f. H. Solen anguinus.\r\n\r\nLang. Test. 6. Tubulus vermicularis crista dentata.\r\n\r\nTesta albida, teretiuscula, angulis 9 obsoletis. Anfractus inæquales,\r\nnunc confertiores, nunc remotiores. Sulcus longitudinalis in superiore\r\nlatere perforatus serie punctorum. Spinæ breves, fornicatæ ad angulos\r\nin latere inferiore.\r\n\r\nCondensation, that peculiar faculty of the mental organization of\r\nLinnæus, induced him to suppress this description, and attach the\r\nspecies, as a variety, to the form he had simultaneously characterized\r\nas _D._ spira elongata, teretiusculum, inerme, fissura longitudinali.\r\nGualt. test. 10. f. z.\r\n\r\nTo this latter the published details belong, except the expression\r\n\"passim concatenata et quasi poris pertusa\" (which was a subsequent\r\nand fallacious addition), and the account of the variety.\r\n\r\nS. PENIS. _D._ teres, extremitate radiata disco cylindris poroso.\r\n\r\n\"Bonan. i. f. 38.\", indicated in the tenth edition of the 'Systema',\r\nwas among the synonyms. The \"Stigma, &c.\" was an addition; so too were\r\n\"lævis,\" \"tubulosis\", and \"æqualibus\". The term \"hemisphærico\" has\r\nreplaced the earlier \"convexo.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the published species, the _S. Spirorbis_ of the\r\n'Systema' appears to have been indicated as\r\n\r\nD. PLANORBE. _D._ spira plana, adhærens.\r\n\r\nIt. W. Goth. 170. Dentalium testa spirali plana adhærente.\r\n\r\nPlanc. Conch. 13. n. 3. Vermiculus in littore Veneto foliis algæ\r\nadhærens.\r\n\r\nTesta minima, magnitudine nuper ab ovo exclusæ cochleæ, cujus formam\r\nomnino gerit, at plana omnino est, et altero latere omnino fuci foliis\r\nadhæret.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently different from the _Serpula planorbis_ of the\r\n'Systema.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalogue of the Dipterous Insects collected at Makessar in Celebes,\r\nby Mr. A.

By ALFRED R.\r\nWALLACE, Esq. Communicated by CHARLES DARWIN, Esq., F.R.S. & L.S.\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 3rd, 1859.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Sclater's paper on the Geographical Distribution of Birds,\r\nread before the Linnean Society, and published in the 'Proceedings'\r\nfor February 1858, he has pointed out that the western islands of the\r\nArchipelago belong to the Indian, and the eastern to the Australian\r\nregion of Ornithology. My researches in these countries lead me to\r\nbelieve that the same division will hold good in every branch of\r\nZoology; and the object of my present communication is to mark out\r\nthe precise limits of each region, and to call attention to some\r\ninferences of great general importance as regards the study of the\r\nlaws of organic distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Australian and Indian regions of Zoology are very strongly\r\ncontrasted. In one the Marsupial order constitutes the great mass of\r\nthe mammalia,--in the other not a solitary marsupial animal exists.\r\nMarsupials of at least two genera (_Cuscus_ and _Belideus_) are found\r\nall over the Moluccas and in Celebes; but none have been detected\r\nin the adjacent islands of Java and Borneo. Of all the varied forms\r\nof _Quadrumana_, _Carnivora_, _Insectivora_ and _Ruminantia_ which\r\nabound in the western half of the Archipelago, the only genera found\r\nin the Moluccas are _Paradoxurus_ and _Cervus_. The _Sciuridæ_, so\r\nnumerous in the western islands, are represented in Celebes by only\r\ntwo or three species, while not one is found further east. Birds\r\nfurnish equally remarkable illustrations. The Australian region is\r\nthe richest in the world in Parrots; the Asiatic is (of tropical\r\nregions) the poorest. Three entire families of the Psittacine order\r\nare peculiar to the former region, and two of them, the Cockatoos\r\nand the Lories, extend up to its extreme limits, without a solitary\r\nspecies passing into the Indian islands of the Archipelago. The genus\r\n_Paloeornis_ is, on the other hand, confined with equal strictness to\r\nthe Indian region. In the Rasorial order, the _Phasianidæ_ are Indian,\r\nthe _Megapodiidæ_ Australian; but in this case one species of each\r\nfamily just passes the limits into the adjacent region. The genus\r\n_Tropidorhynchus_, highly characteristic of the Australian region,\r\nand everywhere abundant as well in the Moluccas and New Guinea as in\r\nAustralia, is quite unknown in Java and Borneo. On the other hand,\r\nthe entire families of _Bucconidæ_, _Trogonidæ_ and _Phyllornithidæ_,\r\nand the genera _Pericrocotus_, _Picnonotus_, _Trichophorus_, _Ixos_,\r\nin fact, almost all the vast family of Thrushes and a host of\r\nother genera, cease abruptly at the eastern side of Borneo, Java,\r\nand Bali. All these groups are _common birds_ in the great Indian\r\nislands; they abound everywhere; they are the characteristic features\r\nof the ornithology; and it is most striking to a naturalist, on\r\npassing the narrow straits of Macassar and Lombock, suddenly to miss\r\nthem entirely, together with the _Quadrumana_ and _Felidæ_, the\r\n_Insectivora_ and _Rodentia_, whose varied species people the forests\r\nof Sumatra, Java, and Borneo.\r\n\r\nTo define exactly the limits of the two regions where they are\r\n(geographically) most intimately connected, I may mention that during\r\na few days' stay in the island of Bali I found birds of the genera\r\n_Copsychus_, _Megalaima_, _Tiga_, _Ploceus_, and _Sturnopastor_,\r\nall characteristic of the Indian region and abundant in Malacca,\r\nJava, and Borneo; while on crossing over to Lombock, during three\r\nmonths collecting there, not one of them was ever seen; neither have\r\nthey occurred in Celebes nor in any of the more eastern islands I\r\nhave visited. Taking this in connexion with the fact of _Cacatua_,\r\n_Tropidorhynchus_, and _Megapodius_ having their western limit in\r\nLombock, we may consider it established that the Strait of Lombock\r\n(only 15 miles wide) marks the limits and abruptly separates two of\r\nthe great Zoological regions of the globe. The Philippine Islands are\r\nin some respects of doubtful location, resembling and differing from\r\nboth regions. They are deficient in the varied Mammals of Borneo,\r\nbut they contain no Marsupials. The Psittaci are scarce, as in the\r\nIndian region; the Lories are altogether absent, but there is one\r\nrepresentative of the Cockatoos. Woodpeckers, Trogons, and the genera\r\n_Ixos_, _Copsychus_, and _Ploceus_ are highly characteristic of India.\r\n_Tanysiptera_ and _Megapodius_, again, are Australian forms, but\r\nthese seem represented by only solitary species. The islands possess\r\nalso a few peculiar genera. We must on the whole place the Philippine\r\nIslands in the Indian region, but with the remark that they are\r\ndeficient in some of its most striking features. They possess several\r\nisolated forms of the Australian region, but by no means sufficient to\r\nconstitute a real transition thereto.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Philippines out of the question for the present, the\r\nwestern and eastern islands of the Archipelago, as here divided,\r\nbelong to regions more distinct and contrasted than any other of the\r\ngreat zoological divisions of the globe. South America and Africa,\r\nseparated by the Atlantic, do not differ so widely as Asia and\r\nAustralia; Asia with its abundance and variety of large Mammals and\r\nno Marsupials, and Australia with scarcely anything but Marsupials;\r\nAsia with its gorgeous _Phasianidæ_, Australia with its dull-coloured\r\n_Megapodiidæ_; Asia the poorest tropical region in Parrots, Australia\r\nthe richest; and all these striking characteristics are almost\r\nunimpaired at the very limits of their respective districts; so that\r\nin a few hours we may experience an amount of zoological difference\r\nwhich only weeks or even months of travel will give us in any other\r\npart of the world!\r\n\r\nMoreover there is nothing in the aspect or physical character of\r\nthe islands to lead us to expect such a difference; their physical\r\nand geological differences do not coincide with the zoological\r\ndifferences. There is a striking homogeneity in the TWO _halves_ of\r\nthe Archipelago. The great volcanic chain runs through both parts;\r\nBorneo is the counterpart of New Guinea; the Philippines closely\r\nresemble the equally fertile and equally volcanic Moluccas; while\r\nin eastern Java begins to be felt the more arid climate of Timor\r\nand Australia. But these resemblances are accompanied by an extreme\r\nzoological diversity, the Asiatic and Australian regions finding in\r\nBorneo and New Guinea respectively their highest development.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said: \"The separation between these two regions is not\r\nso absolute. There _is_ some transition. There _are_ species and\r\ngenera common to the eastern and western islands.\" This is true, yet\r\n(in my opinion) proves no transition in the proper sense of the word;\r\nand the nature and amount of the resemblance only shows more strongly\r\nthe absolute and original distinctness of the two divisions. The\r\nexception here clearly proves the rule.\r\n\r\nLet us investigate these cases of supposed transition. In the western\r\nislands almost the only instance of a group peculiar to Australia and\r\nthe eastern islands is the _Megapodius_ in North-west Borneo. Not one\r\nof the Australian forms of Mammalia passes the limits of the region.\r\nOn the other hand, Quadrumana occur in Celebes, Batchian, Lombock,\r\nand perhaps Timor; Deer have reached Celebes, Timor, Buru, Ceram, and\r\nGilolo, but not New Guinea; Pigs have extended to New Guinea, probably\r\nthe true eastern limit of the genus _Sus_; Squirrels are found in\r\nCelebes, Lombock, and Sumbawa: among birds, _Gallus_ occurs in Celebes\r\nand Sumbawa, Woodpeckers reach Celebes, and Hornbills extend to the\r\nNorth-west of New Guinea. These cases of identity or resemblance in\r\nthe animals of the two regions we may group into three classes; 1st,\r\nidentical species; 2nd, closely allied or representative species; and\r\n3rd, species of peculiar and isolated genera. The common Grey Monkey\r\n(_Macacus cynomolgus_) has reached Lombock, and perhaps Timor, but\r\nnot Celebes. The Deer of the Moluccas seems to be a variety of the\r\n_Cervus rufus_ of Java and Borneo. The Jungle Cock of Celebes and\r\nLombock is a Javanese species. _Hirundo javanica_, _Zosterops flavus_,\r\n_Halcyon collaris_, _Eurystomus gularis_, _Macropygia phasianella_,\r\n_Merops javanicus_, _Anthreptes lepida_, _Ptilonopus melanocephala_,\r\nand some other birds appear the same in the adjacent islands of\r\nthe eastern and western divisions, and some of them range over the\r\nwhole Archipelago. But after reading Lyell on the various modes of\r\ndispersion of animals, and looking at the proximity of the islands, we\r\nshall feel astonished, not at such an amount of interchange of species\r\n(most of which are birds of great powers of flight), but rather that\r\nin the course of ages a much greater and almost complete fusion has\r\nnot taken place. Were the Atlantic gradually to narrow till only a\r\nstrait of twenty miles separated Africa from South America, can we\r\nhelp believing that many birds and insects and some few mammals would\r\nsoon be interchanged? But such interchange would be a fortuitous\r\nmixture of faunas essentially and absolutely dissimilar, not a natural\r\nand regular transition from one to the other. In like manner the\r\ncases of identical species in the eastern and western islands of the\r\nArchipelago are due to the gradual and accidental commingling of\r\noriginally absolutely distinct faunas.\r\n\r\nIn our second class (representative species) we must place the Wild\r\nPigs, which seem to be of distinct but closely allied species in each\r\nisland; the Squirrels also of Celebes are of peculiar species, as are\r\nthe Woodpeckers and Hornbills, and two Celebes birds of the Asiatic\r\ngenera _Phænicophæus_ and _Acridotheres_. Now these and a few more of\r\nlike character are closely allied to other species inhabiting Java,\r\nBorneo, or the Philippines. We have only therefore to suppose that the\r\nspecies of the western passed over to the eastern islands at so remote\r\na period as on one side or the other to have become extinct, and to\r\nhave been replaced by an allied form, and we shall have produced\r\nexactly the state of things now existing. Such extinction and such\r\nreplacement we know has been continually going on. Such has been the\r\nregular course of nature for countless ages in every part of the earth\r\nof which we have geological records; and unless we _are_ prepared\r\nto show that the Indo-Australian Archipelago was an altogether\r\nexceptional region, such must have been the course of nature here\r\nalso. If these islands have existed in their present form only during\r\none of the later divisions of the Tertiary period, and if interchange\r\nof species at very rare and distant intervals has occurred, then the\r\nfact of some identical and other closely allied species is a necessary\r\nresult, even if the two regions in question had been originally\r\npeopled by absolutely distinct creations of organic beings, and there\r\nhad never been any closer connexion between them than _now_ exists.\r\nThe occurrence of a limited number of representative species in the\r\ntwo divisions of the Archipelago does not therefore prove any true\r\ntransition from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe examples of our third class--of peculiar genera having little\r\nor no affinity with those of the adjacent islands--are almost\r\nentirely confined to Celebes, and render that island a district _per\r\nse_, in the highest degree interesting. _Cynopithecus_, a genus of\r\nBaboons, the extraordinary Babirusa and the singular ruminant _Ansa\r\ndepressicornis_ have nothing in common with Asiatic mammals, but seem\r\nmore allied to those of Africa. A quadrumanous animal of the same\r\ngenus (perhaps identical) occurs in the little island of Batchian,\r\nwhich forms the extreme eastern limit of the highest order of\r\nmammalia. An allied species is also said to exist in the Philippines.\r\nNow this occurrence of quadrumana in the Australian region proves\r\nnothing whatever as regards a transition to the western islands,\r\nwhich, among their numerous monkeys and apes, have nothing at all\r\nresembling them. The species of Celebes and Batchian have the high\r\nsuperorbital ridge, the long nasal bone, the dog-like figure, the\r\nminute erect tail, the predaceous habits and the fearless disposition\r\nof the true Baboons, and find their allies nowhere nearer than in\r\ntropical Africa. The _Anoa_ seems also to point towards the same\r\nregion, so rich in varied forms of Antelopes.\r\n\r\nIn the class of birds, Celebes possesses a peculiar genus of Parrots\r\n(_Prioniturus_), said to occur also in the Philippines; _Meropogon_,\r\nintermediate between an Indian and an African form of Bee-eaters; and\r\nthe anomalous _Scissirostrum_, which Prince Bonaparte places next to a\r\nMadagascar bird, and forms a distinct subfamily for the reception of\r\nthe two. Celebes also contains a species of _Coracias_, which is here\r\nquite out of its normal area, the genus being otherwise confined to\r\nAfrica and continental India, not occurring in any other part of the\r\nArchipelago. The Celebes bird is placed, in Bonaparte's 'Conspectus,'\r\nbetween two African species, to which therefore I presume it is more\r\nnearly allied than to those of India. Having just received Mr. Smith's\r\nCatalogue of the Hymenoptera collected during my first residence in\r\nCelebes, I find in it some facts of an equally singular nature. Of 103\r\nspecies, only 16 are known to inhabit any of the western islands of\r\nthe Archipelago, while 18 are identical with species of continental\r\nIndia, China, and the Philippine Islands, two are stated to be\r\nidentical with insects hitherto known only from tropical Africa, and\r\nanother is said to be most closely allied to one from the Cape.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena of distribution are, I believe, the most anomalous\r\nyet known, and in fact altogether unique. I am aware of no other spot\r\nupon the earth which contains a number of species, in several distinct\r\nclasses of animals, the nearest allies to which do not exist in any\r\nof the countries which on every side surround it, but which are to be\r\nfound only in another primary division of the globe, separated from\r\nthem all by a vast expanse of ocean. In no other case are the species\r\nof a genus or the genera of a family distributed in _two_ distinct\r\nareas separated by countries in which they do not exist; so that it\r\nhas come to be considered a law in geographical distribution, \"that\r\nboth species and groups inhabit continuous areas.\"\r\n\r\nFacts such as these can only be explained by a bold acceptance of vast\r\nchanges in the surface of the earth. They teach us that this island of\r\nCelebes is more ancient than most of the islands now surrounding it,\r\nand obtained some part of its fauna before they came into existence.\r\nThey point to the time when a great continent occupied a portion\r\nat least of what is now the Indian Ocean, of which the islands of\r\nMauritius, Bourbon, &c. may be fragments, while the Chagos Bank and\r\nthe Keeling Atolls indicate its former extension eastward to the\r\nvicinity of what is now the Malayan Archipelago. The Celebes group\r\nremains the last eastern fragment of this now submerged land, or of\r\nsome of its adjacent islands, indicating its peculiar origin by its\r\nzoological isolation, and by still retaining a marked affinity with\r\nthe African fauna.\r\n\r\nThe great Pacific continent, of which Australia and New Guinea are\r\nno doubt fragments, probably existed at a much earlier period, and\r\nextended as far westward as the Moluccas. The extension of Asia as far\r\nto the south and east as the Straits of Macassar and Lombock must have\r\noccurred subsequent to the submergence of both these great southern\r\ncontinents; and the breaking up and separation of the islands of\r\nSumatra, Java, and Borneo has been the last great geological change\r\nthese regions have undergone. That this has really taken place as\r\nhere indicated, we think is proved by the following considerations.\r\nNot more than twenty (probably a smaller number) out of about one\r\nhundred land birds of Celebes at present known are found in Java\r\nor Borneo, and only one or two of twelve or fifteen Mammalia. Of\r\nthe Mammalia and birds of Borneo, however, at least three-fourths,\r\nprobably five-sixths, inhabit also Java, Sumatra, or the peninsula of\r\nMalacca. Now, looking at the direction of the Macassar Straits running\r\nnearly north and south, and remembering we are in the district of the\r\nmonsoons, a steady south-east and north-west wind blowing alternately\r\nfor about six months each, we shall at once see that Celebes is more\r\nfavourably situated than any other island to receive stray passengers\r\nfrom Borneo, whether drifted across the sea or wafted through the\r\nair. The distance too is less than between any of the other large\r\nislands; there are no violent currents to neutralize the action of\r\nthe winds; and numerous islets in mid-channel offer stations which\r\nmight rescue many of the wanderers, and admit, after repose, of\r\nfresh migrations. Between Java and Borneo the width of sea is much\r\ngreater, the intermediate islands are fewer, and the direction of\r\nthe monsoons _along_ and not _across_ the Java sea, accompanied by\r\nalternating currents in the same direction, must render accidental\r\ncommunication between the two islands exceedingly difficult; so that\r\nwhere the facilities for intercommunication are greatest, the number\r\nof species common to the two countries is least, and _vice versá_.\r\nBut again, the mass of the species of Borneo, Java, &c., even when not\r\n_identical_ are _congeneric_, which, as before explained, indicates\r\n_identity_ at an earlier epoch; whereas the great mass of the fauna\r\nof Celebes is widely different from that of the western islands,\r\nconsisting mostly of genera, and even of entire families, altogether\r\nforeign to them. This clearly points to a former total diversity\r\nof forms and species,--existing similarities being the result of\r\nintermixture, the extreme facilities for which we have pointed out. In\r\nthe case of the great western islands a former more complete identity\r\nis indicated, the present differences having arisen from their\r\nisolation during a considerable period, allowing time for that partial\r\nextinction and introduction of species which is the regular course\r\nof nature. If the very small number of western species in Celebes is\r\nall that the most favourable conditions for transmission could bring\r\nabout, the complete similarity of the faunas of the western islands\r\ncould never (with far less favourable conditions) have been produced\r\nby the same means. And what other means can we conceive but the former\r\nconnexion of those islands with each other and with the continent of\r\nAsia?\r\n\r\nIn striking confirmation of this view we have physical evidence\r\nof a very interesting nature. These countries are in fact _still\r\nconnected_, and that so completely that an elevation of only 300 feet\r\nwould nearly double the extent of tropical Asia. Over the whole of the\r\nJava Sea, the Straits of Malacca, the Gulf of Siam, and the southern\r\npart of the China Sea, ships can anchor in less than fifty fathoms.\r\nA vast submarine plain unites together the apparently disjointed\r\nparts of the Indian zoological region, and abruptly terminates,\r\nexactly at its limits, in an unfathomable ocean. The deep sea of the\r\nMoluccas comes up to the very coasts of Northern Borneo, to the Strait\r\nof Lombock in the south, and to near the middle of the Strait of\r\nMacassar. May we not therefore from these facts very fairly conclude\r\nthat, according to the system of alternate bands of elevation and\r\ndepression that seems very generally to prevail, the last great rising\r\nmovement of the volcanic range of Java and Sumatra was accompanied\r\nby the depression that now separates them from Borneo and from the\r\ncontinent?\r\n\r\nIt it worthy of remark that the various islands of the Moluccas,\r\nthough generally divided by a less extent of sea, have fewer species\r\nin common; but the separating seas are in almost every case of immense\r\ndepth, indicating that the separation took place at a much earlier\r\nperiod. The same principle is well illustrated by the distribution\r\nof the genus _Paradisea_, two species of which (the common Birds\r\nof Paradise) are found only in New Guinea and the islands of Aru,\r\nMysol, Waigiou, and Jobie, all of which are connected with New Guinea\r\nby banks of soundings, while they do not extend to Ceram or the Ké\r\nIslands, which are no further from New Guinea, but are separated from\r\nit by deep sea. Again, the chain of small volcanic islands to the west\r\nof Gilolo, though divided by channels of only ten or fifteen miles\r\nwide, possess many distinct representative species of insects, and\r\neven, in some cases, of birds also. The Baboons of Batchian have not\r\npassed to Gilolo, a much larger island, only separated from it by a\r\nchannel ten miles wide, and in one part almost blocked up with small\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nNow looking at these phenomena of distribution, and especially at\r\nthose presented by the fauna of Celebes, it appears to me that a much\r\nexaggerated effect, in producing the present distribution of animals,\r\nhas been imputed to the accidental transmission of individuals across\r\nintervening seas; for we have here as it were a test or standard by\r\nwhich we may measure the possible effect due to these causes, and we\r\nfind that, under conditions perhaps the most favourable that exist\r\non the globe, the percentage of species derived from this source is\r\nextremely small. When my researches in the Archipelago are completed,\r\nI hope to be able to determine with some accuracy this numerical\r\nproportion in several cases; but in the mean time we will consider\r\n20 per cent. as the probable maximum for birds and mammals which in\r\nCelebes have been derived from Borneo or Java.\r\n\r\nLet us now apply this standard to the case of Great Britain and\r\nthe Continent, in which the width of dividing sea and the extent\r\nof opposing coasts are nearly the same, but in which the species\r\nare almost all identical,--or to Ireland, more than 90 per cent. of\r\nwhose species are British,--and we shall at once see that no theory\r\nof transmission across the present Straits is admissible, and shall\r\nbe compelled to resort to the idea of a very recent separation (long\r\nsince admitted), to account for these zoological phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to the oceanic islands that we consider the\r\napplication of this test of the most importance. Let any one try to\r\nrealize the comparative facilities for the transmission of organized\r\nbeings across the Strait of Macassar from Borneo to Celebes, and\r\nfrom South Europe or North Africa to the island of Madeira, at least\r\nfour times the distance, and a mere point in the ocean, and he\r\nwould probably consider that in a given period a hundred cases of\r\ntransmission would be more likely to occur in the former case than\r\none in the latter. Yet of the comparatively rich insect-fauna of\r\nMadeira, 40 per cent. are continental species; and of the flowering\r\nplants more than 60 per cent. The Canary Islands offer nearly similar\r\nresults. Nothing but a former connexion with the Continent will\r\nexplain such an amount of specific identity (the weight of which will\r\nbe very much increased if we take into account the representative\r\nspecies); and the direction of the Atlas range towards Teneriffe, and\r\nof the Sierra Nevada towards Madeira, are material indications of such\r\na connexion.\r\n\r\nThe Galapagos are no further from South America than Madeira is from\r\nEurope, and, being of greater extent, are far more liable to receive\r\nchance immigrants; yet they have hardly a species identical with any\r\ninhabiting the American continent. These islands therefore may well\r\nhave originated in mid-ocean; or if they ever were connected with the\r\nmainland, it was at so distant a period that the natural extinction\r\nand renewal of species has left not one in common. The character of\r\ntheir fauna, however, is more what we should expect to arise from the\r\nchance introduction of a very few species at distant intervals; it\r\nis very poor; it contains but few genera, and those scattered among\r\nunconnected families; its genera often contain several closely allied\r\nspecies, indicating a single antitype.\r\n\r\nThe fauna and flora of Madeira and of the Canaries, on the other hand,\r\nhave none of this chance character. They are comparatively rich in\r\ngenera and species; most of the principal groups and families are\r\nmore or less represented; and, in fact, these islands do not differ\r\nmaterially, as to the general character of their animal and vegetable\r\nproductions, from any isolated mountain in Europe or North Africa of\r\nabout equal extent.\r\n\r\nOn exactly the same principles, the very large number of species\r\nof plants, insects, and birds, in Europe and North America, either\r\nabsolutely identical or represented by very closely allied species,\r\nmost assuredly indicates that some means of land communication\r\nin temperate or sub-arctic latitudes existed at no very distant\r\ngeological epoch; and though many naturalists are inclined to\r\nregard all such views as vague and unprofitable speculations, we\r\nare convinced they will soon take their place among the legitimate\r\ndeductions of science.\r\n\r\nGeology can detect but a portion of the changes the surface of the\r\nearth has undergone. It can reveal the past history and mutations\r\nof what is now dry land; but the ocean tells nothing of her bygone\r\nhistory. Zoology and Botany here come to the aid of their sister\r\nscience, and by means of the humble weeds and despised insects\r\ninhabiting its now distant shores, can discover some of those past\r\nchanges which the ocean itself refuses to reveal. They can indicate,\r\napproximately at least, where and at what period former continents\r\nmust have existed, from what countries islands must have been\r\nseparated, and at how distant an epoch the rupture took place. By the\r\ninvaluable indications which Mr. Darwin has deduced from the structure\r\nof coral reefs, by the surveys of the ocean-bed now in progress,\r\nand by a more extensive and detailed knowledge of the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals and plants, the naturalist may soon hope to\r\nobtain some idea of the continents which have now disappeared beneath\r\nthe ocean, and of the general distribution of land and sea at former\r\ngeological epochs.\r\n\r\nMost writers on geographical distribution have completely overlooked\r\nits connexion with well-established geological facts, and have thereby\r\ncreated difficulties where none exist. The peculiar and apparently\r\nendemic faunæ and floræ of the oceanic islands (such as the Galapagos\r\nand St. Helena) have been dwelt upon as something anomalous and\r\ninexplicable. It has been imagined that the more simple condition\r\nof such islands would be to have their productions identical with\r\nthose of the nearest land, and that their actual condition is an\r\nincomprehensible mystery. The very reverse of this is however the\r\ncase. We really require no speculative hypothesis, no new theory, to\r\nexplain these phenomena; they are the logical results of well-known\r\nlaws of nature. The regular and unceasing extinction of species,\r\nand their replacement by allied forms, is now no hypothesis, but an\r\nestablished fact; and it necessarily produces such peculiar faunæ and\r\nfloræ in all but recently formed or newly disrupted islands, subject\r\nof course to more or less modification according to the facilities\r\nfor the transmission of fresh species from adjacent continents. Such\r\nphenomena therefore are far from uncommon. Madagascar, Mauritius,\r\nthe Moluccas, New Zealand, New Caledonia, the Pacific Islands, Juan\r\nFernandez, the West India Islands, and many others, all present such\r\npeculiarities in greater or less development. It is the instances\r\nof identity of species in distant countries that presents the real\r\ndifficulty. What was supposed to be the more normal state of things is\r\nreally exceptional, and requires some hypothesis for its explanation.\r\nThe phenomena of distribution in the Malay Archipelago, to which I\r\nhave here called attention, teach us that, however narrow may be\r\nthe strait separating an island from its continent, it is still an\r\nimpassable barrier against the passage of any considerable number and\r\nvariety of land animals; and that in all cases in which such islands\r\npossess a tolerably rich and varied fauna of species mostly identical,\r\nor closely allied with those of the adjacent country, we are forced to\r\nthe conclusion that a geologically recent disruption has taken place.\r\nGreat Britain, Ireland, Sicily, Sumatra, Java and Borneo, the Aru\r\nIslands, the Canaries and Madeira, are cases to which the reasoning is\r\nfully applicable.\r\n\r\nIn his introductory Essay on the Flora of New Zealand, Dr. Hooker\r\nhas most convincingly applied this principle to show the former\r\nconnexion of New Zealand and other southern islands with the southern\r\nextremity of America; and I will take this opportunity of calling the\r\nattention of zoologists to the very satisfactory manner in which this\r\nview clears away many difficulties in the distribution of animals.\r\nThe most obvious of these is the occurrence of Marsupials in America\r\nonly, beyond the Australian region. They evidently entered by the\r\nsame route as the plants of New Zealand and Tasmania which occur in\r\nSouth temperate America, but having greater powers of dispersion,\r\na greater plasticity of organization, have extended themselves\r\nover the whole continent though with so few modifications of form\r\nand structure as to point to a unity of origin at a comparatively\r\nrecent period. It is among insects, however, that the resemblances\r\napproach in number and degree to those exhibited by plants. Among\r\nButterflies the beautiful _Heliconidæ_ are strictly confined to\r\nSouth America, with the exception of a single genus (_Hamadryas_)\r\nfound in the Australian region from New Zealand to New Guinea.\r\nIn Coleoptera many families and genera are characteristic of the\r\ntwo countries; such are _Pseudomorphidæ_ among the Geodephaga,\r\n_Lamprimidæ_ and _Syndesidæ_ among the Lucani, _Anoplognathidæ_ among\r\nthe Lamellicornes, _Stigmoderidæ_ among the Buprestes, _Natalis_ among\r\nthe Cleridæ, besides a great number of representative genera. This\r\npeculiar distribution has hitherto only excited astonishment, and has\r\nconfounded all ideas of unity in the distribution of organic beings;\r\nbut we now see that they are in exact accordance with the phenomena\r\npresented by the flora of the same regions, as developed in the\r\ngreatest detail by the researches of Dr. Hooker.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat singular, however, that not one _identical species_\r\nof insect should yet have been discovered, while no less than 89\r\nspecies of flowering plants are found both in New Zealand and South\r\nAmerica. The relations of the animals and of the plants of these\r\ncountries must necessarily depend on the same physical changes which\r\nthe Southern hemisphere has undergone; and we are therefore led to\r\nconclude that insects are much less persistent in their specific\r\nforms than flowering plants, while among Mammalia and land birds (in\r\nwhich no genus even is common to the countries in question) species\r\nmust die and be replaced much more rapidly than in either. And this\r\nis exactly in accordance with the fact (well established by geology)\r\nthat at a time when the shells of the European seas were almost all\r\nidentical with species now living, the European Mammalia were almost\r\nall different. The duration of life of species would seem to be in\r\nan inverse proportion to their complexity of organization and vital\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIn the brief sketch I have now given of this interesting subject, such\r\nobvious and striking facts alone have been adduced as a traveller's\r\nnote-book can supply. The argument must therefore lose much of its\r\nweight from the absence of detail and accumulated examples. There\r\nis, however, such a very general accordance in the phenomena of\r\ndistribution as separately deduced from the various classes or\r\nkingdoms of the organic world, that whenever one class of animals or\r\nplants exhibits in a clearly marked manner certain relations between\r\ntwo countries, the other classes will certainly show similar ones,\r\nthough it may be in a greater or a less degree. Birds and insects will\r\nteach us the same truths; and even animals and plants, though existing\r\nunder such different conditions, and multiplied and dispersed by such\r\na generally distinct process, will never give conflicting testimony,\r\nhowever much they may differ as regards the amount of relationship\r\nbetween distant regions indicated by them, and consequently\r\nnotwithstanding the greater or less weight either may have in the\r\ndetermining of questions of this nature.\r\n\r\nThis is my apology for offering to the Linnean Society the present\r\nimperfect outline in anticipation of the more detailed proofs and\r\nillustrations which I hope to bring forward on a future occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            Page\r\n\r\n  Acridotheres,                                              176\r\n  Alligator,                                                   3\r\n  Amblada, _Walk._,                                          144\r\n  ---- atomaria, _Walk._,                                    145\r\n  Ampsalis, _Walk._,                                          98\r\n  ---- geniata, _Walk._,                                      99\r\n  Ancylus fluviatilis,                                        39\r\n  Anoa,                                                      177\r\n  Anodon,                                                     38\r\n  Anomia,                                                 37, 58\r\n  Anopheles, _Meigen_,                                        91\r\n  ---- vanus, _Walk._,                                        91\r\n  Anoplognathidæ,                                            183\r\n  Ansa depressicornis,                                       176\r\n  Anthomyia, _Meigen_,                                       141\r\n  ---- procellaria, _Walk._,                                 141\r\n  Anthomyides, _Walk._,                                      140\r\n  Anthrax, _Fabr._,                                          111\r\n  ---- antecedens, _Walk._,                                  111\r\n  ---- congrua, _Walk._,                                     112\r\n  ---- degenera, _Walk._,                                    113\r\n  ---- demonstrans, _Walk._,                                 112\r\n  ---- prædicans, _Walk._,                                   112\r\n  ---- prætendens, _Walk._,                                  111\r\n  ---- proferens, _Walk._,                                   113\r\n  ---- semiscita, _Walk._,                                   111\r\n  ---- Tantalus, _Fabr._,                                    111\r\n  Anthreptes lepida,                                         175\r\n  Aplysia,                                                38, 40\r\n  Aragara, _Walk._,                                          154\r\n  ---- crassipes, _Walk._,                                   154\r\n  Arca,                                                       55\r\n  Argonauta,                                              42, 60\r\n  Aricia, _Macq._,                                           140\r\n  ---- contraria, _Walk._,                                   140\r\n  ---- integra, _Walk._,                                     140\r\n  ---- nigricosta, _Walk._,                                  140\r\n  ---- significans, _Walk._,                                 140\r\n  Asilidæ, _Leach_,                                          104\r\n  Asilites, _Walk._,                                         106\r\n  Asilus, _Linn._,                                           107\r\n  ---- areolaris, _Walk._,                                   108\r\n  ---- determinatus, _Walk._,                                107\r\n  ---- introducens, _Walk._,                                 108\r\n  ---- tenuicornis, _Walk._,                                 108\r\n  Aspergillum,                                                36\r\n  Aye-Aye (_Cheiromys madagascariensis_, L., Cuv.)
