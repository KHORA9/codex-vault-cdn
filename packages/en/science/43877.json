Without entering into the question touching the scientific\r\nacquirements of eastern nations at a remote period, it is certain that\r\nsome among the early Greeks were in possession of several truths,\r\nhowever acquired, connected with the economy of the universe, which were\r\nafterwards suffered to fall into neglect and oblivion. But the\r\nphilosophers of the old school appear in general to have confined\r\nthemselves at the best to observations; very few traces remain of their\r\nhaving instituted _experiments_, properly so called. This putting of\r\nnature to the torture, as Bacon calls it, has occasioned the principal\r\npart of modern philosophical discoveries. The experimentalist may so\r\norder his examination of nature as to vary at pleasure the circumstances\r\nin which it is made, often to discard accidents which complicate the\r\ngeneral appearances, and at once to bring any theory which he may form\r\nto a decisive test. The province of the mere observer is necessarily\r\nlimited: the power of selection among the phenomena to be presented is\r\nin great measure denied to him, and he may consider himself fortunate if\r\nthey are such as to lead him readily to a knowledge of the laws which\r\nthey follow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to this imperfection of method it may be attributed that natural\r\nphilosophy continued to be stationary, or even to decline, during a long\r\nseries of ages, until little more than two centuries ago. Within this\r\ncomparatively short period it has rapidly reached a degree of perfection\r\nso different from its former degraded state, that we can hardly\r\ninstitute any comparison between the two. Before that epoch, a few\r\ninsulated facts, such as might first happen to be noticed, often\r\ninaccurately observed and always too hastily generalized, were found\r\nsufficient to excite the naturalist's lively imagination; and having\r\nonce pleased his fancy with the supposed fitness of his artificial\r\nscheme, his perverted ingenuity was thenceforward employed in forcing\r\nthe observed phenomena into an imaginary agreement with the result of\r\nhis theory; instead of taking the more rational, and it should seem, the\r\nmore obvious, method of correcting the theory by the result of his\r\nobservations, and considering the one merely as the general and\r\nabbreviated expression of the other. But natural phenomena were not then\r\nvalued on their own account, and for the proofs which they afford of a\r\nvast and beneficent design in the structure of the universe, so much as\r\nfor the fertile topics which the favourite mode of viewing the subject\r\nsupplied to the spirit of scholastic disputation: and it is a\r\nhumiliating reflection that mankind never reasoned so ill as when they\r\nmost professed to cultivate the art of reasoning. However specious the\r\nobjects, and alluring the announcements of this art, the then prevailing\r\nmanner of studying it curbed and corrupted all that is free and noble in\r\nthe human mind. Innumerable fallacies lurked every where among the most\r\ngenerally received opinions, and crowds of dogmatic and self-sufficient\r\npedants fully justified the lively definition, that \"logic is the art of\r\ntalking unintelligibly on things of which we are ignorant.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe error which lay at the root of the philosophy of the middle ages was\r\nthis:—from the belief that general laws and universal principles might\r\nbe discovered, of which the natural phenomena were _effects_, it was\r\nthought that the proper order of study was, first to detect the general\r\n_cause_, and then to pursue it into its consequences; it was considered\r\nabsurd to begin with the effect instead of the cause; whereas the real\r\nchoice lay between proceeding from particular facts to general facts,\r\nor from general facts to particular facts; and it was under this\r\nmisrepresentation of the real question that all the sophistry lurked. As\r\nsoon as it is well understood that the general _cause_ is no other than\r\na single fact, common to a great number of phenomena, it is necessarily\r\nperceived that an accurate scrutiny of these latter must precede any\r\nsafe reasoning with respect to the former. But at the time of which we\r\nare speaking, those who adopted this order of reasoning, and who began\r\ntheir inquiries by a minute and sedulous investigation of facts, were\r\ntreated with disdain, as men who degraded the lofty name of philosophy\r\nby bestowing it upon mere mechanical operations. Among the earliest and\r\nnoblest of these was Galileo.\r\n\r\nIt is common, especially in this country, to name Bacon as the founder\r\nof the present school of experimental philosophy; we speak of the\r\nBaconian or inductive method of reasoning as synonimous and convertible\r\nterms, and we are apt to overlook what Galileo had already done before\r\nBacon's writings appeared. Certainly the Italian did not range over the\r\ncircle of the sciences with the supreme and searching glance of the\r\nEnglish philosopher, but we find in every part of his writings\r\nphilosophical maxims which do not lose by comparison with those of\r\nBacon; and Galileo deserves the additional praise, that he himself gave\r\nto the world a splendid practical illustration of the value of the\r\nprinciples which he constantly recommended. In support of this view of\r\nthe comparative deserts of these two celebrated men, we are able to\r\nadduce the authority of Hume, who will be readily admitted as a\r\ncompetent judge of philosophical merit, where his prejudices cannot bias\r\nhis decision. Discussing the character of Bacon, he says, \"If we\r\nconsider the variety of talents displayed by this man, as a public\r\nspeaker, a man of business, a wit, a courtier, a companion, an author, a\r\nphilosopher, he is justly the object of great admiration. If we consider\r\nhim merely as an author and philosopher, the light in which we view him\r\nat present, though very estimable, he was yet inferior to his\r\ncontemporary Galileo, perhaps even to Kepler. Bacon pointed out at a\r\ndistance the road to true philosophy: Galileo both pointed it out to\r\nothers, and made himself considerable advances in it. The Englishman was\r\nignorant of geometry: the Florentine revived that science, excelled in\r\nit, and was the first that applied it, together with experiment, to\r\nnatural philosophy. The former rejected with the most positive disdain\r\nthe system of Copernicus: the latter fortified it with new proofs\r\nderived both from reason and the senses.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIf we compare them from another point of view, not so much in respect of\r\ntheir intrinsic merit, as of the influence which each exercised on the\r\nphilosophy of his age, Galileo's superior talent or better fortune, in\r\narresting the attention of his contemporaries, seems indisputable. The\r\nfate of the two writers is directly opposed the one to the other;\r\nBacon's works seem to be most studied and appreciated when his readers\r\nhave come to their perusal, imbued with knowledge and a philosophical\r\nspirit, which, however, they have attained independently of his\r\nassistance. The proud appeal to posterity which he uttered in his will,\r\n\"For my name and memory, I leave it to men's charitable speeches, and to\r\nforeign nations, and the next ages,\" of itself indicates a consciousness\r\nof the fact that his contemporary countrymen were but slightly affected\r\nby his philosophical precepts. But Galileo's personal exertions changed\r\nthe general character of philosophy in Italy: at the time of his death,\r\nhis immediate pupils had obtained possession of the most celebrated\r\nuniversities, and were busily engaged in practising and enforcing the\r\nlessons which he had taught them; nor was it then easy to find there a\r\nsingle student of natural philosophy who did not readily ascribe the\r\nformation of his principles to the direct or remote influence of\r\nGalileo's example. Unlike Bacon's, his reputation, and the value of his\r\nwritings, were higher among his contemporaries than they have since\r\nbecome. This judgment perhaps awards the highest intellectual prize to\r\nhim whose disregarded services rise in estimation with the advance of\r\nknowledge; but the praise due to superior usefulness belongs to him who\r\nsucceeded in training round him a school of imitators, and thereby\r\nenabled his imitators to surpass himself.\r\n\r\nThe biography of men who have devoted themselves to philosophical\r\npursuits seldom affords so various and striking a succession of\r\nincidents as that of a soldier or statesman. The life of a man who is\r\nshut up during the greater part of his time in his study or laboratory\r\nsupplies but scanty materials for personal details; and the lapse of\r\ntime rapidly removes from us the opportunities of preserving such\r\npeculiarities as might have been worth recording. An account of it will\r\ntherefore consist chiefly in a review of his works and opinions, and of\r\nthe influence which he and they have exercised over his own and\r\nsucceeding ages. Viewed in this light, few lives can be considered more\r\ninteresting than that of Galileo; and if we compare the state in which\r\nhe found, with that in which he left, the study of nature, we shall feel\r\nhow justly an enthusiastic panegyric pronounced upon the age immediately\r\nfollowing him may be transferred to this earlier period. \"This is the\r\nage wherein all men's minds are in a kind of fermentation, and the\r\nspirit of wisdom and learning begins to mount and free itself from those\r\ndrossie and terrene impediments wherewith it has been so long clogged,\r\nand from the insipid phlegm and _caput mortuum_ of useless notions in\r\nwhich it hath endured so violent and long a fixation. This is the age\r\nwherein, methinks, philosophy comes in with a spring tide, and the\r\nperipatetics may as well hope to stop the current of the tide, or, with\r\nXerxes, to fetter the ocean, as hinder the overflowing of free\r\nphilosophy. Methinks I see how all the old rubbish must be thrown away,\r\nand the rotten buildings be overthrown and carried away, with so\r\npowerful an inundation. These are the days that must lay a new\r\nfoundation of a more magnificent philosophy, never to be overthrown,\r\nthat will empirically and sensibly canvass the phenomena of nature,\r\ndeducing the causes of things from such originals in nature as we\r\nobserve are producible by art, and the infallible demonstration of\r\nmechanics: and certainly this is the way, and no other, to build a true\r\nand permanent philosophy.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Ménage.\r\n\r\n[2] Hume's England, James I.\r\n\r\n[3] Power's Experimental Philosophy, 1663.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    _Galileo's Birth—Family—Education—Observation of the\r\n      Pendulum—Pulsilogies—Hydrostatical Balance—Lecturer at Pisa._\r\n\r\n\r\nGALILEO GALILEI was born at Pisa, on the 15th day of February, 1564, of\r\na noble and ancient Florentine family, which, in the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, adopted this surname instead of Bonajuti, under\r\nwhich several of their ancestors filled distinguished offices in the\r\nFlorentine state. Some misapprehension has occasionally existed, in\r\nconsequence of the identity of his proper name with that of his family;\r\nhis most correct appellation would perhaps be Galileo de' Galilei, but\r\nthe surname usually occurs as we have written it. He is most commonly\r\nspoken of by his Christian name, agreeably to the Italian custom; just\r\nas Sanzio, Buonarotti, Sarpi, Reni, Vecelli, are universally known by\r\ntheir Christian names of Raphael, Michel Angelo, Fra Paolo, Guido, and\r\nTitian.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors have followed Rossi in styling Galileo illegitimate, but\r\nwithout having any probable grounds even when they wrote, and the\r\nassertion has since been completely disproved by an inspection of the\r\nregisters at Pisa and Florence, in which are preserved the dates of his\r\nbirth, and of his mother's marriage, eighteen months previous to it.[4]\r\n\r\nHis father, Vincenzo Galilei, was a man of considerable talent and\r\nlearning, with a competent knowledge of mathematics, and particularly\r\ndevoted to the theory and practice of music, on which he published\r\nseveral esteemed treatises. The only one which it is at present easy to\r\nprocure—his Dialogue on ancient and modern music—exhibits proofs, not\r\nonly of a thorough acquaintance with his subject, but of a sound and\r\nvigorous understanding applied to other topics incidentally discussed.\r\nThere is a passage in the introductory part, which becomes interesting\r\nwhen considered as affording some traces of the precepts by which\r\nGalileo was in all probability trained to reach his preeminent station\r\nin the intellectual world. \"It appears to me,\" says one of the speakers\r\nin the dialogue, \"that they who in proof of any assertion rely simply on\r\nthe weight of authority, without adducing any argument in support of it,\r\nact very absurdly: I, on the contrary, wish to be allowed freely to\r\nquestion and freely to answer you without any sort of adulation, as well\r\nbecomes those who are truly in search of truth.\" Sentiments like these\r\nwere of rare occurrence at the close of the sixteenth century, and it is\r\nto be regretted that Vincenzo hardly lived long enough to witness his\r\nidea of a true philosopher splendidly realized in the person of his son.\r\nVincenzo died at an advanced age, in 1591. His family consisted of three\r\nsons, Galileo, Michel Angelo, and Benedetto, and the same number of\r\ndaughters, Giulia, Virginia, and Livia. After Vincenzo's death the chief\r\nsupport of the family devolved upon Galileo, who seems to have assisted\r\nthem to his utmost power. In a letter to his mother, dated 1600,\r\nrelative to the intended marriage of his sister Livia with a certain\r\nPompeo Baldi, he agrees to the match, but recommends its temporary\r\npostponement, as he was at that time exerting himself to furnish money\r\nto his brother Michel Angelo, who had received the offer of an\r\nadvantageous settlement in Poland. As the sum advanced to his brother,\r\nwhich prevented him from promoting his sister's marriage, did not exceed\r\n200 crowns, it may be inferred that the family were in a somewhat\r\nstraitened condition. However he promises, as soon as his brother should\r\nrepay him, \"to take measures for the young lady, since she too is bent\r\nupon _coming out_ to prove the miseries of this world.\"—As Livia was at\r\nthe date of this letter in a convent, the last expression seems to\r\ndenote that she had been destined to take the veil. This proposed\r\nmarriage never took place, but Livia was afterwards married to Taddeo\r\nGalletti: her sister Virginia married Benedetto Landucci. Galileo\r\nmentions one of his sisters, (without naming her) as living with him in\r\n1619 at Bellosguardo. Michel Angelo is probably the same brother of\r\nGalileo who is mentioned by Liceti as having communicated from Germany\r\nsome observations on natural history.[5] He finally settled in the\r\nservice of the Elector of Bavaria; in what situation is not known, but\r\nupon his death the Elector granted a pension to his family, who then\r\ntook up their abode at Munich. On the taking of that city in 1636, in\r\nthe course of the bloody thirty years' war, which was then raging\r\nbetween the Austrians and Swedes, his widow and four of his children\r\nwere killed, and every thing which they possessed was either burnt or\r\ncarried away. Galileo sent for his two nephews, Alberto and a younger\r\nbrother, to Arcetri near Florence, where he was then living. These two\r\nwere then the only survivors of Michel Angelo's family; and many of\r\nGalileo's letters about that date contain allusions to the assistance he\r\nhad been affording them. The last trace of Alberto is on his return into\r\nGermany to the Elector, in whose service his father had died. These\r\ndetails include almost every thing which is known of the rest of\r\nVincenzo's family.\r\n\r\nGalileo exhibited early symptoms of an active and intelligent mind, and\r\ndistinguished himself in his childhood by his skill in the construction\r\nof ingenious toys and models of machinery, supplying the deficiencies of\r\nhis information from the resources of his own invention; and he\r\nconciliated the universal good-will of his companions by the ready good\r\nnature with which he employed himself in their service and for their\r\namusement. It is worthy of observation, that the boyhood of his great\r\nfollower Newton, whose genius in many respects so closely resembled his\r\nown, was marked by a similar talent. Galileo's father was not opulent,\r\nas has been already stated: he was burdened with a large family, and was\r\nunable to provide expensive instructors for his son; but Galileo's own\r\nenergetic industry rapidly supplied the want of better opportunities;\r\nand he acquired, under considerable disadvantages, the ordinary\r\nrudiments of a classical education, and a competent knowledge of the\r\nother branches of literature which were then usually studied. His\r\nleisure hours were applied to music and drawing; for the former\r\naccomplishment he inherited his father's talent, being an excellent\r\nperformer on several instruments, especially on the lute; this continued\r\nto be a favourite recreation during the whole of his life. He was also\r\npassionately fond of painting, and at one time he wished to make it his\r\nprofession: and his skill and judgment of pictures were highly esteemed\r\nby the most eminent contemporary artists, who did not scruple to own\r\npublicly their deference to young Galileo's criticism.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached his nineteenth year, his father, becoming daily more\r\nsensible of his superior genius, determined, although at a great\r\npersonal sacrifice, to give him the advantages of an university\r\neducation. Accordingly, in 1581, he commenced his academical studies in\r\nthe university of his native town, Pisa, his father at this time\r\nintending that he should adopt the profession of medicine. In the\r\nmatriculation lists at Pisa, he is styled Galileo, the son of Vincenzo\r\nGalilei, a Florentine, Scholar in Arts. His instructor was the\r\ncelebrated botanist, Andreas Cæsalpinus, who was professor of medicine\r\nat Pisa from 1567 to 1592. Hist. Acad. Pisan.; Pisis, 1791. It is dated\r\n5th November, 1581. Viviani, his pupil, friend, and panegyrist, declares\r\nthat, almost from the first day of his being enrolled on the lists of\r\nthe academy, he was noticed for the reluctance with which he listened to\r\nthe dogmas of the Aristotelian philosophy, then universally taught; and\r\nhe soon became obnoxious to the professors from the boldness with which\r\nhe promulgated what they styled his philosophical paradoxes. His early\r\nhabits of free inquiry were irreconcileable with the mental quietude of\r\nhis instructors, whose philosophic doubts, when they ventured to\r\nentertain any, were speedily lulled by a quotation from Aristotle.\r\nGalileo thought himself capable of giving the world an example of a\r\nsounder and more original mode of thinking; he felt himself destined to\r\nbe the founder of a new school of rational and experimental philosophy.\r\nOf this we are now securely enjoying the benefits; and it is difficult\r\nat this time fully to appreciate the obstacles which then presented\r\nthemselves to free inquiry: but we shall see, in the course of this\r\nnarrative, how arduous their struggle was who happily effected this\r\nimportant revolution. The vindictive rancour with which the partisans of\r\nthe old philosophy never ceased to assail Galileo is of itself a\r\nsufficient proof of the prominent station which he occupied in the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nGalileo's earliest mechanical discovery, to the superficial observer\r\napparently an unimportant one, occurred during the period of his studies\r\nat Pisa. His attention was one day arrested by the vibrations of a lamp\r\nswinging from the roof of the cathedral, which, whether great or small,\r\nseemed to recur at equal intervals. The instruments then employed for\r\nmeasuring time were very imperfect: Galileo attempted to bring his\r\nobservation to the test before quitting the church, by comparing the\r\nvibrations with the beatings of his own pulse, and his mind being then\r\nprincipally employed upon his intended profession, it occurred to him,\r\nwhen he had further satisfied himself of their regularity by repeated\r\nand varied experiments, that the process he at first adopted might be\r\nreversed, and that an instrument on this principle might be usefully\r\nemployed in ascertaining the rate of the pulse, and its variation from\r\nday to day. He immediately carried the idea into execution, and it was\r\nfor this sole and limited purpose that the first pendulum was\r\nconstructed. Viviani tells us, that the value of the invention was\r\nrapidly appreciated by the physicians of the day, and was in common use\r\nin 1654, when he wrote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Instrument No. 1, No. 2, No. 3]\r\n\r\nSantorio, who was professor of medicine at Padua, has given\r\nrepresentations of four different forms of these instruments, which he\r\ncalls pulsilogies, (_pulsilogias_,) and strongly recommends to medical\r\npractitioners.[6] These instruments seem to have been used in the\r\nfollowing manner: No. 1 consists merely of a weight fastened to a string\r\nand a graduated scale. The string being gathered up into the hand till\r\nthe vibrations of the weight coincided with the beatings of the\r\npatient's pulse, the length was ascertained from the scale, which, of\r\ncourse, if great, indicated a languid, if shorter, a more lively action.\r\nIn No. 2 the improvement is introduced of connecting the scale and\r\nstring, the length of the latter is regulated by the turns of a peg at\r\n_a_, and a bead upon the string at _b_ showed the measure. No. 3 is\r\nstill more compact, the string being shortened by winding upon an axle\r\nat the back of the dial-plate. The construction of No. 4, which Santorio\r\nclaims as his own improvement, is not given, but it is probable that the\r\nprincipal index, by its motion, shifted a weight to different distances\r\nfrom the point of suspension, and that the period of vibration was\r\nstill more accurately adjusted by a smaller weight connected with the\r\nsecond index. Venturi seems to have mistaken the third figure for that\r\nof a pendulum clock, as he mentions this as one of the earliest\r\nadaptations of Galileo's principle to that purpose;[7] but it is\r\nobvious, from Santorio's description, that it is nothing more than a\r\ncircular scale, the index showing, by the figure to which it points, the\r\nlength of string remaining unwound upon the axis. We shall, for the\r\npresent, postpone the consideration of the invention of pendulum clocks,\r\nand the examination of the different claims to the honour of their first\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which we are speaking, Galileo was entirely ignorant of\r\nmathematics, the study of which was then at a low ebb, not only in\r\nItaly, but in every part of Europe. Commandine had recently revived a\r\ntaste for the writings of Euclid and Archimedes, and Vieta Tartalea and\r\nothers had made considerable progress in algebra, Guido Ubaldi and\r\nBenedetti had done something towards establishing the principles of\r\nstatics, which was the only part of mechanics as yet cultivated; but\r\nwith these inconsiderable exceptions the application of mathematics to\r\nthe phenomena of nature was scarcely thought of. Galileo's first\r\ninducement to acquire a knowledge of geometry arose from his partiality\r\nfor drawing and music, and from the wish to understand their principles\r\nand theory. His father, fearful lest he should relax his medical\r\nstudies, refused openly to encourage him in this new pursuit; but he\r\nconnived at the instruction which his son now began to receive in the\r\nwritings of Euclid, from the tuition of an intimate friend, named\r\nOstilio Ricci, who was one of the professors in the university.\r\nGalileo's whole attention was soon directed to the enjoyment of the new\r\nsensations thus communicated to him, insomuch that Vincenzo, finding his\r\nprognostics verified, began to repent his indirect sanction, and\r\nprivately requested Ricci to invent some excuse for discontinuing his\r\nlessons. But it was fortunately too late; the impression was made and\r\ncould not be effaced; from that time Hippocrates and Galen lay unheeded\r\nbefore the young physician, and served only to conceal from his father's\r\nsight the mathematical volumes on which the whole of his time was really\r\nemployed. His progress soon revealed the true nature of his pursuits:\r\nVincenzo yielded to the irresistible predilection of his son's mind, and\r\nno longer attempted to turn him from the speculations to which his whole\r\nexistence was thenceforward abandoned.\r\n\r\nAfter mastering the elementary writers, Galileo proceeded to the study\r\nof Archimedes, and, whilst perusing the Hydrostatics of that author,\r\ncomposed his earliest work,—an Essay on the Hydrostatical Balance. In\r\nthis he explains the method probably adopted by Archimedes for the\r\nsolution of Hiero's celebrated question[8], and shows himself already\r\nwell acquainted with the true principles of specific gravities. This\r\nessay had an immediate and important influence on young Galileo's\r\nfortunes, for it introduced him to the approving notice of Guido Ubaldi,\r\nthen one of the most distinguished mathematicians of Italy. At his\r\nsuggestion Galileo applied himself to consider the position of the\r\ncentre of gravity in solid bodies, a choice of subject that sufficiently\r\nshowed the estimate Ubaldi had formed of his talents; for it was a\r\nquestion on which Commandine had recently written, and which engaged at\r\nthat time the attention of geometricians of the highest order. Galileo\r\ntells us himself that he discontinued these researches on meeting with\r\nLucas Valerio's treatise on the same subject. Ubaldi was so much struck\r\nwith the genius displayed in the essay with which Galileo furnished him,\r\nthat he introduced him to his brother, the Cardinal Del Monte: by this\r\nlatter he was mentioned to Ferdinand de' Medici, the reigning Duke of\r\nTuscany, as a young man of whom the highest expectations might be\r\nentertained. By the Duke's patronage he was nominated, in 1589, to the\r\nlectureship of mathematics at Pisa, being then in his twenty-sixth year.\r\nHis public salary was fixed at the insignificant sum of sixty crowns\r\nannually, but he had an opportunity of greatly adding to his income by\r\nprivate tuition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Erythræus, Pinacotheca, vol. i.; Salusbury's Life of Galileo.

He\r\ninstituted a course of experiments for the purpose of putting to the\r\ntest the mechanical doctrines of Aristotle, most of which he found\r\nunsupported even by the pretence of experience. It is to be regretted\r\nthat we do not more frequently find detailed his method of\r\nexperimenting, than occasionally in the course of his dialogues, and it\r\nis chiefly upon the references which he makes to the results with which\r\nthe experiments furnished him, and upon the avowed and notorious\r\ncharacter of his philosophy, that the truth of these accounts must be\r\nmade to depend. Venturi has found several unpublished papers by Galileo\r\non the subject of motion, in the Grand Duke's private library at\r\nFlorence, bearing the date of 1590, in which are many of the theorems\r\nwhich he afterwards developed in his Dialogues on Motion. These were not\r\npublished till fifty years afterwards, and we shall reserve an account\r\nof their contents till we reach that period of his life.\r\n\r\nGalileo was by no means the first who had ventured to call in question\r\nthe authority of Aristotle in matters of science, although he was\r\nundoubtedly the first whose opinions and writings produced a very marked\r\nand general effect. Nizzoli, a celebrated scholar who lived in the early\r\npart of the 16th century, had condemned Aristotle's philosophy,\r\nespecially his Physics, in very unequivocal and forcible terms,\r\ndeclaring that, although there were many excellent truths in his\r\nwritings, the number was scarcely less of false, useless, and ridiculous\r\npropositions.[9] About the time of Galileo's birth, Benedetti had\r\nwritten expressly in confutation of several propositions contained in\r\nAristotle's mechanics, and had expounded in a clear manner some of the\r\ndoctrines of statical equilibrium.[10] Within the last forty years it\r\nhas been established that the celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci, who\r\ndied in 1519, amused his leisure hours in scientific pursuits; and many\r\nideas appear to have occurred to him which are to be found in the\r\nwritings of Galileo at a later date. It is not impossible (though there\r\nare probably no means of directly ascertaining the fact) that Galileo\r\nmay have been acquainted with Leonardo's investigations, although they\r\nremained, till very lately, almost unknown to the mathematical world.\r\nThis supposition is rendered more probable from the fact, that Mazenta,\r\nthe preserver of Leonardo's manuscripts, was, at the very time of their\r\ndiscovery, a contemporary student with Galileo at Pisa. Kopernik, or, as\r\nhe is usually called, Copernicus, a native of Thorn in Prussia, had\r\npublished his great work, De Revolutionibus, in 1543, restoring the\r\nknowledge of the true theory of the solar system, and his opinions were\r\ngradually and silently gaining ground.\r\n\r\nIt is not satisfactorily ascertained at what period Galileo embraced\r\nthe new astronomical theory. Gerard Voss attributes his conversion\r\nto a public lecture of Mæstlin, the instructor of Kepler; and later\r\nwriters (among whom is Laplace) repeat the same story, but without\r\nreferring to any additional sources of information, and in most\r\ninstances merely transcribing Voss's words, so as to shew indisputably\r\nwhence they derived their account. Voss himself gives no authority,\r\nand his general inaccuracy makes his mere word not of much weight. The\r\nassertion appears, on many accounts, destitute of much probability.\r\nIf the story were correct, it seems likely that some degree of\r\nacquaintance, if not of friendly intercourse, would have subsisted\r\nbetween Mæstlin, and his supposed pupil, such as in fact we find\r\nsubsisting between Mæstlin and his acknowledged pupil Kepler, the\r\ndevoted friend of Galileo; but, on the contrary, we find Mæstlin\r\nwriting to Kepler himself of Galileo as an entire stranger, and in\r\nthe most disparaging terms. If Mæstlin could lay claim to the honour\r\nof so celebrated a disciple, it is not likely that he could fail so\r\nentirely to comprehend the distinction it must confer upon himself as\r\nto attempt diminishing it by underrating his pupil's reputation. There\r\nis a passage in Galileo's works which more directly controverts the\r\nclaim advanced for Mæstlin, although Salusbury, in his life of Galileo,\r\nhaving apparently an imperfect recollection of its tenor, refers to\r\nthis very passage in confirmation of Voss's statement. In the second\r\npart of the dialogue on the Copernican system, Galileo makes Sagredo,\r\none of the speakers in it, give the following account:—\"Being very\r\nyoung, and having scarcely finished my course of philosophy, which I\r\nleft off as being set upon other employments, there chanced to come\r\ninto these parts a certain foreigner of Rostoch, _whose name, as I\r\nremember, was Christianus Urstisius_, a follower of Copernicus, who,\r\nin an academy, gave two or three lectures upon this point, to whom\r\nmany flocked as auditors; but I, thinking they went more for the\r\nnovelty of the subject than otherwise, did not go to hear him; for I\r\nhad concluded with myself that that opinion could be no other than a\r\nsolemn madness; and questioning some of those who had been there, I\r\nperceived they all made a jest thereof, except one, who told me that\r\nthe business was not altogether to be laughed at: and because the man\r\nwas reputed by me to be very intelligent and wary, I repented that I\r\nwas not there, and began from that time forward, as oft as I met with\r\nany one of the Copernican persuasion, to demand of them if they had\r\nbeen always of the same judgment. Of as many as I examined I found not\r\nso much as one who told me not that he had been a long time of the\r\ncontrary opinion, but to have changed it for this, as convinced by the\r\nstrength of the reasons proving the same; and afterwards questioning\r\nthem one by one, to see whether they were well possessed of the reasons\r\nof the other side, I found them all to be very ready and perfect in\r\nthem, so that I could not truly say that they took this opinion out\r\nof ignorance, vanity, or to show the acuteness of their wits. On the\r\ncontrary, of as many of the Peripatetics and Ptolemeans as I have\r\nasked, (and out of curiosity I have talked with many,) what pains they\r\nhad taken in the book of Copernicus, I found very few that had so much\r\nas superficially perused it, but of those who I thought had understood\r\nthe same, not one: and, moreover, I have inquired amongst the followers\r\nof the Peripatetic doctrine, if ever any of them had held the contrary\r\nopinion, and likewise found none that had. Whereupon, considering that\r\nthere was no man who followed the opinion of Copernicus that had not\r\nbeen first on the contrary side, and that was not very well acquainted\r\nwith the reasons of Aristotle and Ptolemy, and, on the contrary, that\r\nthere was not one of the followers of Ptolemy that had ever been of\r\nthe judgment of Copernicus, and had left that to embrace this of\r\nAristotle;—considering, I say, these things, I began to think that\r\none who leaveth an opinion imbued with his milk and followed by very\r\nmany, to take up another, owned by very few, and denied by all the\r\nschools, and that really seems a great paradox, must needs have been\r\nmoved, not to say forced, by more powerful reasons. For this cause I\r\nam become very curious to dive, as they say, into the bottom of this\r\nbusiness.\" It seems improbable that Galileo should think it worth while\r\nto give so detailed an account of the birth and growth of opinion in\r\nany one besides himself; and although Sagredo is not the personage who\r\ngenerally in the dialogue represents Galileo, yet as the real Sagredo\r\nwas a young nobleman, a pupil of Galileo himself, the account cannot\r\nrefer to him. The circumstance mentioned of the intermission of his\r\nphilosophical studies, though in itself trivial, agrees very well with\r\nGalileo's original medical destination. Urstisius is not a fictitious\r\nname, as possibly Salusbury may have thought, when alluding to this\r\npassage; he was mathematical professor at Bâle, about 1567, and several\r\ntreatises by him are still extant. According to Kästner, his German name\r\nwas Wursteisen. In 1568 Voss informs us that he published some new\r\nquestions on Purbach's Theory of the Planets. He died at Bâle in 1586,\r\nwhen Galileo was about twenty-two years old.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that Galileo also, in part, owed his emancipation\r\nfrom popular prejudices to the writings of Giordano Bruno, an\r\nunfortunate man, whose unsparing boldness in exposing fallacies and\r\nabsurdities was rewarded by a judicial murder, and by the character of\r\nheretic and infidel, with which his executioners endeavoured to\r\nstigmatize him for the purpose of covering over their own atrocious\r\ncrime. Bruno was burnt at Rome in 1600, but not, as Montucla supposes,\r\non account of his \"Spaccio della Bestia trionfante.\" The title of this\r\nbook has led him to suppose that it was directed against the church of\r\nRome, to which it does not in the slightest degree relate. Bruno\r\nattacked the fashionable philosophy alternately with reason and\r\nridicule, and numerous passages in his writings, tedious and obscure as\r\nthey generally are, show that he had completely outstripped the age in\r\nwhich he lived. Among his astronomical opinions, he believed that the\r\nuniverse consisted of innumerable systems of suns with assemblages of\r\nplanets revolving round each of them, like our own earth, the smallness\r\nof which, alone, prevented their being observed by us. He remarked\r\nfurther, \"that it is by no means improbable that there are yet other\r\nplanets revolving round our own sun, which we have not yet noticed,\r\neither on account of their minute size or too remote distance from us.\"\r\nHe declined asserting that all the apparently fixed stars are really so,\r\nconsidering this as not sufficiently proved, \"because at such enormous\r\ndistances the motions become difficult to estimate, and it is only by\r\nlong observation that we can determine if any of these move round each\r\nother, or what other motions they may have.\" He ridiculed the\r\nAristotelians in no very measured terms—\"They harden themselves, and\r\nheat themselves, and embroil themselves for Aristotle; they call\r\nthemselves his champions, they hate all but Aristotle's friends, they\r\nare ready to live and die for Aristotle, and yet they do not understand\r\nso much as the titles of Aristotle's chapters.\" And in another place he\r\nintroduces an Aristotelian inquiring, \"Do you take Plato for an\r\nignoramus—Aristotle for an ass?\" to whom he answers, \"My son, I neither\r\ncall them asses, nor you mules,—them baboons, nor you apes,—as you\r\nwould have me: I told you that I esteem them the heroes of the world,\r\nbut I will not credit them without sufficient reason; and if you were\r\nnot both blind and deaf, you would understand that I must disbelieve\r\ntheir absurd and contradictory assertions.\"[11] Bruno's works, though in\r\ngeneral considered those of a visionary and madman, were in very\r\nextensive circulation, probably not the less eagerly sought after from\r\nbeing included among the books prohibited by the Romish church; and\r\nalthough it has been reserved for later observations to furnish complete\r\nverification of his most daring speculations, yet there was enough,\r\nabstractedly taken, in the wild freedom of his remarks, to attract a\r\nmind like Galileo's; and it is with more satisfaction that we refer the\r\nformation of his opinions to a man of undoubted though eccentric genius,\r\nlike Bruno, than to such as Maestlin, who, though a diligent and careful\r\nobserver, seems seldom to have taken any very enlarged views of the\r\nscience on which he was engaged.\r\n\r\nWith a few exceptions similar to those above mentioned, the rest of\r\nGalileo's contemporaries well deserved the contemptuous epithet which he\r\nfixed on them of Paper Philosophers, for, to use his own words, in a\r\nletter to Kepler on this subject, \"this sort of men fancied philosophy\r\nwas to be studied like the Æneid or Odyssey, and that the true reading\r\nof nature was to be detected by the collation of texts.\" Galileo's own\r\nmethod of philosophizing was widely different; seldom omitting to bring\r\nwith every new assertion the test of experiment, either directly in\r\nconfirmation of it, or tending to show its probability and consistency.\r\nWe have already seen that he engaged in a series of experiments to\r\ninvestigate the truth of some of Aristotle's positions. As fast as he\r\nsucceeded in demonstrating the falsehood of any of them, he denounced\r\nthem from his professorial chair with an energy and success which\r\nirritated more and more against him the other members of the academic\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThere seems something in the stubborn opposition which he encountered in\r\nestablishing the truth of his mechanical theorems, still more stupidly\r\nabsurd than in the ill will to which, at a later period of his life, his\r\nastronomical opinions exposed him: it is intelligible that the vulgar\r\nshould withhold their assent from one who pretended to discoveries in\r\nthe remote heavens, which few possessed instruments to verify, or\r\ntalents to appreciate; but it is difficult to find terms for\r\nstigmatizing the obdurate folly of those who preferred the evidence of\r\ntheir books to that of their senses, in judging of phenomena so obvious\r\nas those, for instance, presented by the fall of bodies to the ground.\r\nAristotle had asserted, that if two different weights of the same\r\nmaterial were let fall from the same height, the heavier one would reach\r\nthe ground sooner than the other, in the proportion of their weights.\r\nThe experiment is certainly not a very difficult one, but nobody thought\r\nof that method of argument, and consequently this assertion had been\r\nlong received, upon his word, among the axioms of the science of motion.\r\nGalileo ventured to appeal from the authority of Aristotle to that of\r\nhis own senses, and maintained that, with the exception of an\r\ninconsiderable difference, which he attributed to the disproportionate\r\nresistance of the air, they would fall in the same time. The\r\nAristotelians ridiculed and refused to listen to such an idea. Galileo\r\nrepeated his experiments in their presence from the famous leaning tower\r\nat Pisa: and with the sound of the simultaneously falling weights still\r\nringing in their ears, they could persist in gravely maintaining that a\r\nweight of ten pounds would reach the ground in a tenth part of the time\r\ntaken by one of a single pound, because they were able to quote chapter\r\nand verse in which Aristotle assures them that such is the fact. A\r\ntemper of mind like this could not fail to produce ill will towards him\r\nwho felt no scruples in exposing their wilful folly; and the watchful\r\nmalice of these men soon found the means of making Galileo desirous of\r\nquitting his situation at Pisa. Don Giovanni de' Medici, a natural son\r\nof Cosmo, who possessed a slight knowledge of mechanics on which he\r\nprided himself, had proposed a contrivance for cleansing the port of\r\nLeghorn, on the efficiency of which Galileo was consulted. His opinion\r\nwas unfavourable, and the violence of the inventor's disappointment,\r\n(for Galileo's judgment was verified by the result,) took the somewhat\r\nunreasonable direction of hatred towards the man whose penetration had\r\nforeseen the failure. Galileo's situation was rendered so unpleasant by\r\nthe machinations of this person, that he decided on accepting overtures\r\nelsewhere, which had already been made to him; accordingly, under the\r\nnegotiation of his staunch friend Guido Ubaldi, and with the consent of\r\nFerdinand, he procured from the republic of Venice a nomination for six\r\nyears to the professorship of mathematics in the university of Padua,\r\nwhither he removed in September 1592.\r\n\r\nGalileo's predecessor in the mathematical chair at Padua was Moleti, who\r\ndied in 1588, and the situation had remained unfilled during the\r\nintervening four years. This seems to show that the directors attributed\r\nbut little importance to the knowledge which it was the professor's duty\r\nto impart. This inference is strengthened by the fact, that the amount\r\nof the annual salary attached to it did not exceed 180 florins, whilst\r\nthe professors of philosophy and civil law, in the same university, were\r\nrated at the annual stipends of 1400 and 1680 florins.[12] Galileo\r\njoined the university about a year after its triumph over the Jesuits,\r\nwho had established a school in Padua about the year 1542, and,\r\nincreasing yearly in influence, had shown symptoms of a design to get\r\nthe whole management of the public education into the hands of their own\r\nbody.[13] After several violent disputes it was at length decreed by the\r\nVenetian senate, in 1591, that no Jesuit should be allowed to give\r\ninstruction at Padua in any of the sciences professed in the university.\r\nIt does not appear that after this decree they were again troublesome to\r\nthe university, but this first decree against them was followed, in\r\n1606, by a second more peremptory, which banished them entirely from the\r\nVenetian territory. Galileo would of course find his fellow-professors\r\nmuch embittered against that society, and would naturally feel inclined\r\nto make common cause with them, so that it is not unlikely that the\r\nhatred which the Jesuits afterwards bore to Galileo on personal\r\nconsiderations, might be enforced by their recollection of the\r\nuniversity to which he had belonged.\r\n\r\nGalileo's writings now began to follow each other with great rapidity,\r\nbut he was at this time apparently so careless of his reputation, that\r\nmany of his works and inventions, after a long circulation in manuscript\r\namong his pupils and friends, found their way into the hands of those\r\nwho were not ashamed to publish them as their own, and to denounce\r\nGalileo's claim to the authorship as the pretence of an impudent\r\nplagiarist. He was, however, so much beloved and esteemed by his\r\nfriends, that they vied with each other in resenting affronts of this\r\nnature offered to him, and in more than one instance he was relieved, by\r\ntheir full and triumphant answers, from the trouble of vindicating his\r\nown character.\r\n\r\nTo this epoch of Galileo's life may be referred his re-invention of the\r\nthermometer. The original idea of this useful instrument belongs to the\r\nGreek mathematician Hero; and Santorio himself, who has been named as\r\nthe inventor by Italian writers, and at one time claimed it himself,\r\nrefers it to him. In 1638, Castelli wrote to Cesarini that \"he\r\nremembered an experiment shown to him more than thirty-five years back\r\nby Galileo, who took a small glass bottle, about the size of a hen's\r\negg, the neck of which was twenty-two inches long, and as narrow as a\r\nstraw. Having well heated the bulb in his hands, and then introducing\r\nits mouth into a vessel in which was a little water, and withdrawing the\r\nheat of his hand from the bulb, the water rose in the neck of the bottle\r\nmore than eleven inches above the level in the vessel, and Galileo\r\nemployed this principle in the construction of an instrument for\r\nmeasuring heat and cold.\"[14] In 1613, a Venetian nobleman named\r\nSagredo, who has been already mentioned as Galileo's friend and pupil,\r\nwrites to him in the following words: \"I have brought the instrument\r\nwhich you invented for measuring heat into several convenient and\r\nperfect forms, so that the difference of temperature between two rooms\r\nis seen as far as 100 degrees.\"[15] This date is anterior to the claims\r\nboth of Santorio and Drebbel, a Dutch physician, who was the first to\r\nintroduce it into Holland.\r\n\r\nGalileo's thermometer, as we have just seen, consisted merely of a glass\r\ntube ending in a bulb, the air in which, being partly expelled by heat,\r\nwas replaced by water from a glass into which the open end of the tube\r\nwas plunged, and the different degrees of temperature were indicated by\r\nthe expansion of the air which yet remained in the bulb, so that the\r\nscale would be the reverse of that of the thermometer now in use, for\r\nthe water would stand at the highest level in the coldest weather. It\r\nwas, in truth, a barometer also, in consequence of the communication\r\nbetween the tube and external air, although Galileo did not intend it\r\nfor this purpose, and when he attempted to determine the relative weight\r\nof the air, employed a contrivance still more imperfect than this rude\r\nbarometer would have been. A passage among his posthumous fragments\r\nintimates that he subsequently used spirit of wine instead of water.\r\n\r\nViviani attributes an improvement of this imperfect instrument, but\r\nwithout specifying its nature, to Ferdinand II., a pupil and subsequent\r\npatron of Galileo, and, after the death of his father Cosmo, reigning\r\nduke of Florence. It was still further improved by Ferdinand's younger\r\nbrother, Leopold de' Medici, who invented the modern process of\r\nexpelling all the air from the tube by boiling the spirit of wine in it,\r\nand of hermetically sealing the end of the tube, whilst the contained\r\nliquid is in this expanded state, which deprived it of its barometrical\r\ncharacter, and first made it an accurate thermometer. The final\r\nimprovement was the employment of mercury instead of spirit of wine,\r\nwhich is recommended by Lana so early as 1670, on account of its equable\r\nexpansion.[16] For further details on the history and use of this\r\ninstrument, the reader may consult the Treatises on the THERMOMETER and\r\nPYROMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Antibarbarus Philosophicus.

Most of our readers are aware of\r\nthe principles of the theory of the celestial motions which Copernicus\r\nrestored; but the number of those who possess much knowledge of the\r\ncumbrous and unwieldy system which it superseded is perhaps more\r\nlimited. The present is not a fit opportunity to enter into many details\r\nrespecting it; these will find their proper place in the History of\r\nAstronomy: but a brief sketch of its leading principles is necessary to\r\nrender what follows intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe earth was supposed to be immoveably fixed in the centre of the\r\nuniverse, and immediately surrounding it the atmospheres of air and\r\nfire, beyond which the sun, moon, and planets, were thought to be\r\ncarried round the earth, fixed each to a separate orb or heaven of solid\r\nbut transparent matter. The order of distance in which they were\r\nsupposed to be placed with regard to the central earth was as follows:\r\nThe Moon, Mercury, Venus, The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. It became\r\na question in the ages immediately preceding Copernicus, whether the Sun\r\nwas not nearer the Earth than Mercury, or at least than Venus; and this\r\nquestion was one on which the astronomical theorists were then chiefly\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nWe possess at this time a curious record of a former belief in this\r\narrangement of the Sun and planets, in the order in which the days of\r\nthe week have been named from them. According to the dreams of\r\nAstrology, each planet was supposed to exert its influence in\r\nsuccession, reckoning from the most distant down to the nearest, over\r\neach hour of the twenty-four. The planet which was supposed to\r\npredominate over the first hour, gave its name to that day.[17] The\r\ngeneral reader will trace this curious fact more easily with the French\r\nor Latin names than with the English, which have been translated into\r\nthe titles of the corresponding Saxon deities. Placing the Sun and\r\nplanets in the following order, and beginning, for instance, with\r\nMonday, or the Moon's day; Saturn ruled the second hour of that day,\r\nJupiter the third, and so round till we come again and again to the Moon\r\non the 8th, 15th, and 22d hours; Saturn ruled the 23d, Jupiter the\r\n24th, so that the next day would be the day of Mars, or, as the Saxons\r\ntranslated it, Tuisco's day, or Tuesday. In the same manner the\r\nfollowing days would belong respectively to Mercury or Woden, Jupiter or\r\nThor, Venus or Frea, Saturn or Seater, the Sun, and again the Moon. In\r\nthis manner the whole week will be found to complete the cycle of the\r\nseven planets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cycle of the seven planets.]\r\n\r\nThe other stars were supposed to be fixed in an outer orb, beyond which\r\nwere two crystalline spheres, (as they were called,) and on the outside\r\nof all, the _primum mobile_ or _first moveable_, which sphere was\r\nsupposed to revolve round the earth in twenty-four hours, and by its\r\nfriction, or rather, as most of the philosophers of that day chose to\r\nterm it, by the sort of heavenly influence which it exercised on the\r\ninterior orbs, to carry them round with a similar motion. Hence the\r\ndiversity of day and night. But beside this principal and general\r\nmotion, each orb was supposed to have one of its own, which was intended\r\nto account for the apparent changes of position of the planets with\r\nrespect to the fixed stars and to each other. This supposition, however,\r\nproving insufficient to account for all the irregularities of motion\r\nobserved, two hypotheses were introduced.—First, that to each planet\r\nbelonged several concentric spheres or heavens, casing each other like\r\nthe coats of an onion, and, secondly, that the centres of these solid\r\nspheres, with which the planet revolved, were placed in the\r\ncircumference of a secondary revolving sphere, the centre of which\r\nsecondary sphere was situated at the earth. They thus acquired the names\r\nof Eccentrics or Epicycles, the latter word signifying a circle upon a\r\ncircle. The whole art of astronomers was then directed towards inventing\r\nand combining different eccentric and epicyclical motions, so as to\r\nrepresent with tolerable fidelity the ever varying phenomena of the\r\nheavens. Aristotle had lent his powerful assistance in this, as in other\r\nbranches of natural philosophy, in enabling the false system to prevail\r\nagainst and obliterate the knowledge of the true, which, as we gather\r\nfrom his own writings, was maintained by some philosophers before his\r\ntime. Of these ancient opinions, only a few traces now remain,\r\nprincipally preserved in the works of those who were adverse to them.\r\nArchimedes says expressly that Aristarchus of Samos, who lived about 300\r\nB. C., taught the immobility of the sun and stars, and that the earth is\r\ncarried round the central sun.[18] Aristotle's words are: \"Most of those\r\nwho assert that the whole concave is finite, say that the earth is\r\nsituated in the middle point of the universe: those who are called\r\nPythagoreans, who live in Italy, are of a contrary opinion. For they say\r\nthat fire is in the centre, and that the earth, which, according to\r\nthem, is one of the stars, occasions the change of day and night by its\r\nown motion, with which it is carried about the centre.\" It might be\r\ndoubtful, upon this passage alone, whether the Pythagorean theory\r\nembraced more than the diurnal motion of the earth, but a little\r\nfarther, we find the following passage: \"Some, as we have said, make the\r\nearth to be one of the stars: others say that it is placed in the centre\r\nof the Universe, and revolves on a central axis.\"[19] From which, in\r\nconjunction with the former extract, it very plainly appears that the\r\nPythagoreans maintained both the diurnal and annual motions of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the supererogatory labour entailed upon astronomers by the\r\nadoption of the system which places the earth in the centre, may be\r\nformed in a popular manner by observing, in passing through a thickly\r\nplanted wood, in how complicated a manner the relative positions of the\r\ntrees appear at each step to be continually changing, and by considering\r\nthe difficulty with which the laws of their apparent motions could be\r\ntraced, if we were to attempt to refer these changes to a real motion of\r\nthe trees instead of the traveller. The apparent complexity in the\r\nheavens is still greater than in the case suggested; because, in\r\naddition to the earth's motions, with which all the stars appear to be\r\nimpressed, each of the planets has also a real motion of its own, which\r\nof course greatly contributes to perplex and complicate the general\r\nappearances. Accordingly the heavens rapidly became, under this system,\r\n\r\n    \"With centric and eccentric scribbled o'er,\r\n    Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb;\"[20]\r\n\r\ncrossing and penetrating each other in every direction. Maestlin has\r\ngiven a concise enumeration of the principal orbs which belonged to this\r\ntheory. After warning the readers that \"they are not mere fictions which\r\nhave nothing to correspond with them out of the imagination, but that\r\nthey exist really, and bodily in the heavens,\"[21] he describes seven\r\nprincipal spheres belonging to each planet, which he classes as\r\nEccentrics, Epicycles, and Concentrepicycles, and explains their use in\r\naccounting for the planet's revolutions, motions of the apogee, and\r\nnodes, &c. &c. In what manner this multitude of solid and crystalline\r\norbs were secured from injuring or interfering with each other was not\r\nvery closely inquired into.\r\n\r\nThe reader will cease to expect any very intelligible explanation of\r\nthis and numberless other difficulties which belong to this unwieldy\r\nmachinery when he is introduced to the reasoning by which it was upheld.\r\nGerolamo Fracastoro, who lived in the sixteenth century, writes in the\r\nfollowing terms, in his work entitled Homocentrica, (certainly one of\r\nthe best productions of the day,) in which he endeavours to simplify the\r\nnecessary apparatus, and to explain all the phenomena (as the title of\r\nhis book implies) by concentric spheres round the earth. \"There are\r\nsome, not only of the ancients but also among the moderns, who believe\r\nthat the stars move freely without any such agency; but it is difficult\r\nto conceive in what manner they have imbued themselves with this notion,\r\n_since not only reason, but the very senses, inform us that all the\r\nstars are carried round fastened to solid spheres_.\" What ideas\r\nFracastoro entertained of the evidence of the \"senses\" it is not now\r\neasy to guess, but he goes on to give a specimen of the \"reasoning\"\r\nwhich appeared to him so incontrovertible. \"The planets are observed to\r\nmove one while forwards, then backwards, now to the right, now to the\r\nleft, quicker and slower by turns; which variety is consistent with a\r\ncompound structure like that of an animal, which possesses in itself\r\nvarious springs and principles of action, but is totally at variance\r\nwith our notion of a simple and undecaying substance like the heavens\r\nand heavenly bodies. For that which is simple, is altogether single, and\r\nsingleness is of one only nature, and one nature can be the cause of\r\nonly one effect; and therefore it is altogether impossible that the\r\nstars of themselves should move with such variety of motion. And\r\nbesides, if the stars move by themselves, they either move in an empty\r\nspace, or in a fluid medium like the air. But there cannot be such a\r\nthing as empty space, and if there were such a medium, the motion of the\r\nstar would occasion condensation and rarefaction in different parts of\r\nit, which is the property of corruptible bodies and where they exist\r\nsome violent motion is going on; but the heavens are incorruptible and\r\nare not susceptible of violent motion, and hence, and from many other\r\nsimilar reasons, any one who is not obstinate may satisfy himself that\r\nthe stars cannot have any independent motion.\"\r\n\r\nSome persons may perhaps think that arguments of this force are\r\nunnecessarily dragged from the obscurity to which they are now for the\r\nmost part happily consigned; but it is essential, in order to set\r\nGalileo's character and merits in their true light, to show how low at\r\nthis time philosophy had fallen. For we shall form a very inadequate\r\nnotion of his powers and deserts if we do not contemplate him in the\r\nmidst of men who, though of undoubted talent and ingenuity, could so far\r\nbewilder themselves as to mistake such a string of unmeaning phrases for\r\nargument: we must reflect on the difficulty every one experiences in\r\ndelivering himself from the erroneous impressions of infancy, which will\r\nremain stamped upon the imagination in spite of all the efforts of\r\nmatured reason to erase them, and consider every step of Galileo's\r\ncourse as a triumph over difficulties of a like nature. We ought to be\r\nfully penetrated with this feeling before we sit down to the perusal of\r\nhis works, every line of which will then increase our admiration of the\r\npenetrating acuteness of his invention and unswerving accuracy of his\r\njudgment. In almost every page we discover an allusion to some new\r\nexperiment, or the germ of some new theory; and amid all this wonderful\r\nfertility it is rarely indeed that we find the exuberance of his\r\nimagination seducing him from the rigid path of philosophical induction.\r\nThis is the more remarkable as he was surrounded by friends and\r\ncontemporaries of a different temperament and much less cautious\r\ndisposition. A disadvantageous contrast is occasionally furnished even\r\nby the sagacious Bacon, who could so far deviate from the sound\r\nprinciples of inductive philosophy, as to write, for instance, in the\r\nfollowing strain, bordering upon the worst manner of the\r\nAristotelians:—\"Motion in a circle has no limit, and seems to emanate\r\nfrom the appetite of the body, which moves only for the sake of moving,\r\nand that it may follow itself and seek its own embraces, and put in\r\naction and enjoy its own nature, and exercise its peculiar operation: on\r\nthe contrary, motion in a straight line seems transitory, and to move\r\ntowards a limit of cessation or rest, and that it may reach some point,\r\nand then put off its motion.\"[22] Bacon rejected all the machinery of\r\nthe _primum mobile_ and the solid spheres, the eccentrics and the\r\nepicycles, and carried his dislike of these doctrines so far as to\r\nassert that nothing short of their gross absurdity could have driven\r\ntheorists to the extravagant supposition of the motion of the earth,\r\nwhich, said he, \"we know to be most false.\"[23] Instances of extravagant\r\nsuppositions and premature generalizations are to be found in almost\r\nevery page of his other great contemporary, Kepler.\r\n\r\nIt is with pain that we observe Delambre taking every opportunity, in\r\nhis admirable History of Astronomy, to undervalue and sneer at Galileo,\r\nseemingly for the sake of elevating the character of Kepler, who appears\r\nhis principal favourite, but whose merit as a philosopher cannot safely\r\nbe brought into competition with that of his illustrious contemporary.\r\nDelambre is especially dissatisfied with Galileo, for taking no notice,\r\nin his \"System of the World,\" of the celebrated laws of the planetary\r\nmotions which Kepler discovered, and which are now inseparably connected\r\nwith his name. The analysis of Newton and his successors has now\r\nidentified those apparently mysterious laws with the general phenomena\r\nof motion, and has thus entitled them to an attention of which, before\r\nthat time, they were scarcely worthy; at any rate not more than is at\r\npresent the empirical law which includes the distances of all the\r\nplanets from the sun (roughly taken) in one algebraical formula. The\r\nobservations of Kepler's day were scarcely accurate enough to prove that\r\nthe relations which he discovered between the distances of the planets\r\nfrom the sun and the periods of their revolutions around him were\r\nnecessarily to be received as demonstrated truths; and Galileo surely\r\nacted most prudently and philosophically in holding himself altogether\r\naloof from Kepler's fanciful devices and numeral concinnities, although,\r\nwith all the extravagance, they possessed much of the genius of the\r\nPlatonic reveries, and although it did happen that Galileo, by\r\nsystematically avoiding them, failed to recognise some important truths.\r\nGalileo probably was thinking of those very laws, when he said of\r\nKepler, \"He possesses a bold and free genius, perhaps too much so; but\r\nhis mode of philosophizing is widely different from mine.\" We shall have\r\nfurther occasion in the sequel to recognise the justice of this remark.\r\n\r\nIn the treatise on the Sphere which bears Galileo's name, and which, if\r\nhe be indeed the author of it, was composed during the early part of his\r\nresidence at Padua, he also adopts the Ptolemaic system, placing the\r\nearth immoveable in the centre, and adducing against its motion the\r\nusual arguments, which in his subsequent writings he ridicules and\r\nrefutes. Some doubts have been expressed of its authenticity; but,\r\nhowever this may be, we have it under Galileo's own hand that he taught\r\nthe Ptolemaic system, in compliance with popular prejudices, for some\r\ntime after he had privately become a convert to the contrary opinions.\r\nIn a letter, apparently the first which he wrote to Kepler, dated from\r\nPadua, 1597, he says, acknowledging the receipt of Kepler's Mysterium\r\nCosmographicum, \"I have as yet read nothing beyond the preface of your\r\nbook, from which however I catch a glimpse of your meaning, and feel\r\ngreat joy on meeting with so powerful an associate in the pursuit of\r\ntruth, and consequently such a friend to truth itself, for it is\r\ndeplorable that there should be so few who care about truth, and who do\r\nnot persist in their perverse mode of philosophizing; but as this is not\r\nthe fit time for lamenting the melancholy condition of our times, but\r\nfor congratulating you on your elegant discoveries in confirmation of\r\nthe truth, I shall only add a promise to peruse your book\r\ndispassionately, and with a conviction that I shall find in it much to\r\nadmire. _This I shall do the more willingly because many years ago I\r\nbecame a convert to the opinions of Copernicus_,[24] and by that theory\r\nhave succeeded in fully explaining many phenomena, which on the contrary\r\nhypothesis are altogether inexplicable. I have arranged many arguments\r\nand confutations of the opposite opinions, _which however I have not yet\r\ndared to publish_, fearing the fate of our master Copernicus, who,\r\nalthough he has earned immortal fame among a few, yet by an infinite\r\nnumber (for so only can the number of fools be measured) is exploded and\r\nderided. If there were many such as you, I would venture to publish my\r\nspeculations; but, since that is not so, I shall take time to consider\r\nof it.\" This interesting letter was the beginning of the friendship of\r\nthese two great men, which lasted uninterruptedly till 1630, the date of\r\nKepler's death. That extraordinary genius never omitted an opportunity\r\nof testifying his admiration of Galileo, although there were not wanting\r\npersons envious of their good understanding, who exerted themselves to\r\nprovoke coolness and quarrel between them. Thus Brutius writes to Kepler\r\nin 1602:[25] \"Galileo tells me he has written to you, and has got your\r\nbook, which however he denied to Magini, and I abused him for praising\r\nyou with too many qualifications. I know it to be a fact that, both in\r\nhis lectures, and elsewhere, he is publishing your inventions as his\r\nown; but I have taken care, and shall continue to do so, that all this\r\nshall redound not to his credit but to yours.\" The only notice which\r\nKepler took of these repeated insinuations, which appear to have been\r\nutterly groundless, was, by renewed expressions of respect and\r\nadmiration, to testify the value he set upon his friend and\r\nfellow-labourer in philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] Dion Cassius, lib. 37.\r\n\r\n[18] The pretended translation by Roberval of an Arabic version of\r\nAristarchus, \"De Systemate Mundi,\" in which the Copernican system is\r\nfully developed, is spurious. Menage asserts this in his observations on\r\nDiogen. Laert. lib. 8, sec. 85, tom. ii., p. 389. (Ed. Amst. 1692.) The\r\ncommentary contains many authorities well worth consulting. Delambre,\r\nHistoire de l'Astronomie, infers it from its not containing some\r\nopinions which Archimedes tells us were held by Aristarchus. A more\r\ndirect proof may be gathered from the following blunder of the supposed\r\ntranslator. Astronomers had been long aware that the earth in different\r\nparts of her orbit is at different distances from the sun. Roberval\r\nwished to claim for Aristarchus the credit of having known this, and\r\nintroduced into his book, not only the mention of the fact, but an\r\nexplanation of its cause. Accordingly he makes Aristarchus give a reason\r\n\"why the sun's apogee (or place of greatest distance from the earth)\r\nmust always be at the north summer solstice.\" In fact, it was there, or\r\nnearly so, in Roberval's time, and he knew not but that it had always\r\nbeen there. It is however moveable, and, when Aristarchus lived, was\r\nnearly half way between the solstices and equinoxes. He therefore would\r\nhardly have given a reason for the necessity of a phenomenon of which,\r\nif he observed anything on the subject, he must have observed the\r\ncontrary. The change in the obliquity of the earth's axis to the\r\necliptic was known in the time of Roberval, and he accordingly has\r\nintroduced the proper value which it had in Aristarchus's time.\r\n\r\n[19] De Cœlo. lib. 2.\r\n\r\n[20] Paradise Lost, b. viii. v. 83.\r\n\r\n[21] Itaque tam circulos primi motus quam orbes secundorum mobilium\r\nreverâ in cœlesti corpore esse concludimus, &c.

On the expiration of the\r\nfirst period for which he had been elected professor, he was rechosen\r\nfor a similar period, with a salary increased to 320 florins. The\r\nimmediate occasion of this augmentation is said by Fabroni[26], to have\r\narisen out of the malice of an ill wisher of Galileo, who, hoping to do\r\nhim disservice, apprized the senate that he was not married to Marina\r\nGamba, then living with him, and the mother of his son Vincenzo. Whether\r\nor not the senate might consider themselves entitled to inquire into the\r\nmorality of his private life, it was probably from a wish to mark their\r\nsense of the informer's impertinence, that they returned the brief\r\nanswer, that \"if he had a family to provide for, he stood the more in\r\nneed of an increased stipend.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Galileo's residence at Padua, and, according to Viviani's\r\nintimation, towards the thirtieth year of his age, that is to say in\r\n1594, he experienced the first attack of a disease which pressed\r\nheavily on him for the rest of his life. He enjoyed, when a young man, a\r\nhealthy and vigorous constitution, but chancing to sleep one afternoon\r\nnear an open window, through which was blowing a current of air cooled\r\nartificially by the fall of water, the consequences were most disastrous\r\nto him. He contracted a sort of chronic complaint, which showed itself\r\nin acute pains in his limbs, chest, and back, accompanied with frequent\r\nhæmorrhages and loss of sleep and appetite; and this painful disorder\r\nthenceforward never left him entirely, but recurred intermittingly, with\r\ngreater or less violence, as long as he lived. Others of the party did\r\nnot even escape so well, but died shortly after committing this\r\nimprudence.\r\n\r\nIn 1604, the attention of astronomers was called to the contemplation of\r\na new star, which appeared suddenly with great splendour in the\r\nconstellation Serpentarius, or Ophiuchus, as it is now more commonly\r\ncalled. Maestlin, who was one of the earliest to notice it, relates his\r\nobservations in the following words: \"How wonderful is this new star! I\r\nam certain that I did not see it before the 29th of September, nor\r\nindeed, on account of several cloudy nights, had I a good view till the\r\n6th of October. Now that it is on the other side of the sun, instead of\r\nsurpassing Jupiter as it did, and almost rivalling Venus, it scarcely\r\nmatches the Cor Leonis, and hardly surpasses Saturn. It continues\r\nhowever to shine with the same bright and strongly sparkling light, and\r\nchanges its colours almost with every moment; first tawny, then yellow,\r\npresently purple and red, and, when it has risen above the vapours, most\r\nfrequently white.\" This was by no means an unprecedented phenomenon; and\r\nthe curious reader may find in Riccioli[27] a catalogue of the principal\r\nnew stars which have at different times appeared. There is a tradition\r\nof a similar occurrence as early as the times of the Greek astronomer\r\nHipparchus, who is said to have been stimulated by it to the formation\r\nof his catalogue of the stars; and only thirty-two years before, in\r\n1572, the same remarkable phenomenon in the constellation Cassiopeia was\r\nmainly instrumental in detaching the celebrated Tycho Brahe from the\r\nchemical studies, which till then divided his attention with astronomy.\r\nTycho's star disappeared at the end of two years; and at that time\r\nGalileo was a child. On the present occasion, he set himself earnestly\r\nto consider the new phenomenon, and embodied the results of his\r\nobservations in three lectures, which have been unfortunately lost. Only\r\nthe exordium of the first has been preserved: in this he reproaches his\r\nauditors with their general insensibility to the magnificent wonders of\r\ncreation daily exposed to their view, in no respect less admirable than\r\nthe new prodigy, to hear an explanation of which they had hurried in\r\ncrowds to his lecture room. He showed, from the absence of parallax,\r\nthat the new star could not be, as the vulgar hypothesis represented, a\r\nmere meteor engendered in our atmosphere and nearer the earth than the\r\nmoon, but must be situated among the most remote heavenly bodies. This\r\nwas inconceivable to the Aristotelians, whose notions of a perfect,\r\nsimple, and unchangeable sky were quite at variance with the\r\nintroduction of any such new body; and we may perhaps consider these\r\nlectures as the first public declaration of Galileo's hostility to the\r\nold Ptolemaic and Aristotelian astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn 1606 he was reappointed to the lectureship, and his salary a second\r\ntime increased, being raised to 520 florins. His public lectures were at\r\nthis period so much thronged that the ordinary place of meeting was\r\nfound insufficient to contain his auditors, and he was on several\r\noccasions obliged to adjourn to the open air,—even from the school of\r\nmedicine, which was calculated to contain one thousand persons.\r\n\r\nAbout this time he was considerably annoyed by a young Milanese, of the\r\nname of Balthasar Capra, who pirated an instrument which Galileo had\r\ninvented some years before, and had called the geometrical and military\r\ncompass. The original offender was a German named Simon Mayer, whom we\r\nshall meet with afterwards arrogating to himself the merit of one of\r\nGalileo's astronomical discoveries; but on this occasion, as soon as he\r\nfound Galileo disposed to resent the injury done to him, he hastily\r\nquitted Italy, leaving his friend Capra to bear alone the shame of the\r\nexposure which followed. The instrument is of simple construction,\r\nconsisting merely of two straight rulers, connected by a joint; so that\r\nthey can be set to any required angle. This simple and useful\r\ninstrument, now called the Sector, is to be found in almost every case\r\nof mathematical instruments. Instead of the trigonometrical and\r\nlogarithmic lines which are now generally engraved upon it, Galileo's\r\ncompass merely contained, on one side, three pairs of lines, divided in\r\nsimple, duplicate, and triplicate proportion, with a fourth pair on\r\nwhich were registered the specific gravities of several of the most\r\ncommon metals. These were used for multiplications, divisions, and the\r\nextraction of roots; for finding the dimensions of equally heavy balls\r\nof different materials, &c. On the other side were lines contrived for\r\nassisting to describe any required polygon on a given line; for finding\r\npolygons of one kind equal in area to those of another; and a multitude\r\nof other similar operations useful to the practical engineer.\r\n\r\nUnless the instrument, which is now called Gunter's scale, be much\r\naltered from what it originally was, it is difficult to understand on\r\nwhat grounds Salusbury charges Gunter with plagiarism from Galileo's\r\nCompass. He declares that he has closely compared the two, and can find\r\nno difference between them.[28] There has also been some confusion, by\r\nseveral writers, between this instrument and what is now commonly called\r\nthe Proportional Compass. The latter consists of two slips of metal\r\npointed at each end, and connected by a pin which, sliding in a groove\r\nthrough both, can be shifted to different positions. Its use is to find\r\nproportional lines; for it is obvious that the openings measured by each\r\npair of legs will be in the same proportion in which the slips are\r\ndivided by the centre. The divisions usually marked on it are calculated\r\nfor finding the submultiples of straight lines, and the chords of\r\nsubmultiple arcs. Montucla has mentioned this mistake of one instrument\r\nfor the other, and charges Voltaire with the more inexcusable error of\r\nconfounding Galileo's with the Mariner's Compass. He refers to a\r\ntreatise by Hulsius for his authority in attributing the Proportional\r\nCompass to Burgi, a Swiss astronomer of some celebrity. Horcher also has\r\nbeen styled the inventor; but he did no more than describe its form and\r\napplication. In the frontispiece of his book is an engraving of this\r\ncompass exactly similar to those which are now used.[29] To the\r\ndescription which Galileo published of his compass, he added a short\r\ntreatise on the method of measuring heights and distances with the\r\nquadrant and plumb line. The treatise, which is printed by itself at the\r\nend of the first volume of the Padua edition of Galileo's works,\r\ncontains nothing more than the demonstrations belonging to the same\r\noperations. They are quite elementary, and contain little or nothing\r\nthat was new even at that time.\r\n\r\nSuch an instrument as Galileo's Compass was of much more importance\r\nbefore the grand discovery of logarithms than it can now be considered:\r\nhowever it acquires an additional interest from the value which he\r\nhimself set on it. In 1607, Capra, at the instigation of Mayer,\r\npublished as his own invention what he calls the proportional hoop,\r\nwhich is a mere copy of Galileo's instrument. This produced from Galileo\r\na long essay, entitled \"A Defence of Galileo against the Calumnies and\r\nImpostures of Balthasar Capra.\" His principal complaint seems to have\r\nbeen of the misrepresentations which Capra had published of his lectures\r\non the new star already mentioned, but he takes occasion, after pointing\r\nout the blunders and falsehoods which Capra had committed on that\r\noccasion, to add a complete proof of his piracy of the geometrical\r\ncompass. He showed, from the authenticated depositions of workmen, and\r\nof those for whom the instruments had been fabricated, that he had\r\ndevised them as early as the year 1597, and had explained their\r\nconstruction and use both to Balthasar himself and to his father Aurelio\r\nCapra, who was then residing in Padua. He gives, in the same essay, the\r\nminutes of a public meeting between himself and Capra, in which he\r\nproved, to the satisfaction of the university, that wherever Capra had\r\nendeavoured to introduce into his book propositions which were not to be\r\nmet with in Galileo's, he had fallen into the greatest absurdities, and\r\nbetrayed the most complete ignorance of his subject. The consequence of\r\nthis public exposure, and of the report of the famous Fra Paolo Sarpi,\r\nto whom the matter had been referred, was a formal prohibition by the\r\nuniversity of Capra's publication, and all copies of the book then on\r\nhand were seized, and probably destroyed, though Galileo has preserved\r\nit from oblivion by incorporating it in his own publication.\r\n\r\nNearly at the same time, 1607, or immediately after, he first turned his\r\nattention towards the loadstone, on which our countryman Gilbert had\r\nalready published his researches, conducted in the true spirit of the\r\ninductive method. Very little that is original is to be found in\r\nGalileo's works on this subject, except some allusions to his method of\r\narming magnets, in which, as in most of his practical and mechanical\r\noperations, he appears to have been singularly successful. Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby[30] asserts, that the magnets armed by Galileo would support twice\r\nas great a weight as one of Gilbert's of the same size. Galileo was well\r\nacquainted, as appears from his frequent allusions in different parts of\r\nhis works, with what Gilbert had done, of whom he says, \"I extremely\r\npraise, admire, and envy this author;—I think him, moreover, worthy of\r\nthe greatest praise for the many new and true observations that he has\r\nmade to the disgrace of so many vain and fabling authors, who write, not\r\nfrom their own knowledge only, but repeat every thing they hear from the\r\nfoolish vulgar, without attempting to satisfy themselves of the same by\r\nexperience, perhaps that they may not diminish the size of their books.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo's reputation being now greatly increased, proposals were made to\r\nhim, in 1609, to return to his original situation at Pisa. He had been\r\nin the habit of passing over to Florence during the academic vacation,\r\nfor the purpose of giving mathematical instruction to the younger\r\nmembers of Ferdinand's family; and Cosmo, who had now succeeded his\r\nfather as duke of Tuscany, regretted that so masterly a genius had been\r\nallowed to leave the university which he naturally should have graced. A\r\nfew extracts from Galileo's answers to these overtures will serve to\r\nshow the nature of his situation at Padua, and the manner in which his\r\ntime was there occupied. \"I will not hesitate to say, having now\r\nlaboured during twenty years, and those the best of my life, in dealing\r\nout, as one may say, in detail, at the request of any body, the little\r\ntalent which God has granted to my assiduity in my profession, that my\r\nwish certainly would be to have sufficient rest and leisure to enable\r\nme, before my life comes to its close, to conclude three great works\r\nwhich I have in hand, and to publish them; which might perhaps bring\r\nsome credit to me, and to those who had favoured me in this undertaking,\r\nand possibly may be of greater and more frequent service to students\r\nthan in the rest of my life I could personally afford them. Greater\r\nleisure than I have here I doubt if I could meet with elsewhere, so long\r\nas I am compelled to support my family from my public and private\r\nlectures, (nor would I willingly lecture in any other city than this,\r\nfor several reasons which would be long to mention) nevertheless not\r\neven the liberty I have here is sufficient, where I am obliged to spend\r\nmany, and often the best hours of the day at the request of this and\r\nthat man.—My public salary here is 520 florins, which I am almost\r\ncertain will be advanced to as many crowns upon my re-election, and\r\nthese I can greatly increase by receiving pupils, and from private\r\nlectures, to any extent that I please. My public duty does not confine\r\nme during more than 60 half hours in the year, and even that not so\r\nstrictly but that I may, on occasion of any business, contrive to get\r\nsome vacant days; the rest of my time is absolutely at my own disposal;\r\nbut because my private lectures and domestic pupils are a great\r\nhindrance and interruption of my studies, I wish to live entirely exempt\r\nfrom the former, and in great measure from the latter: for if I am to\r\nreturn to my native country, I should wish the first object of his\r\nSerene Highness to be, that leisure and opportunity should be given me\r\nto complete my works without employing myself in lecturing.—And, in\r\nshort, I should wish to gain my bread from my writings, which I would\r\nalways dedicate to my Serene Master.—The works which I have to finish\r\nare principally—two books on the system or structure of the Universe,\r\nan immense work, full of philosophy, astronomy, and geometry; three\r\nbooks on Local Motion, a science entirely new, no one, either ancient or\r\nmodern, having discovered any of the very many admirable accidents which\r\nI demonstrate in natural and violent motions, so that I may with very\r\ngreat reason call it a new science, and invented by me from its very\r\nfirst principles; three books of Mechanics, two on the demonstration of\r\nprinciples and one of problems; and although others have treated this\r\nsame matter, yet all that has been hitherto written, neither in\r\nquantity, nor otherwise, is the quarter of what I am writing on it. I\r\nhave also different treatises on natural subjects; On sound and speech;\r\nOn light and colours; On the tide; On the composition of continuous\r\nquantity; On the motions of animals;—And others besides. I have also\r\nan idea of writing some books relating to the military art, giving not\r\nonly a model of a soldier, but teaching with very exact rules every\r\nthing which it is his duty to know that depends upon mathematics; as the\r\nknowledge of castrametation, drawing up battalions, fortifications,\r\nassaults, planning, surveying, the knowledge of artillery, the use of\r\ninstruments, &c. I also wish to reprint the 'Use of my Geometrical\r\nCompass,' which is dedicated to his highness, and which is no longer to\r\nbe met with; for this instrument has experienced such favour from the\r\npublic, that in fact no other instruments of this kind are now made, and\r\nI know that up to this time several thousands of mine have been made.—I\r\nsay nothing as to the amount of my salary, feeling convinced that as I\r\nam to live upon it, the graciousness of his highness would not deprive\r\nme of any of those comforts, which, however, I feel the want of less\r\nthan many others; and therefore I say nothing more on the subject.\r\nFinally, on the title and profession of my service, I should wish that\r\nto the name of Mathematician, his highness would add that of\r\nPhilosopher, as I profess to have studied a greater number of years in\r\nphilosophy than months in pure mathematics; and how I have profited by\r\nit, and if I can or ought to deserve this title, I may let their\r\nhighnesses see as often as it shall please them to give me an\r\nopportunity of discussing such subjects in their presence with those who\r\nare most esteemed in this knowledge.\" It may perhaps be seen in the\r\nexpressions of this letter, that Galileo was not inclined to undervalue\r\nhis own merits, but the peculiar nature of the correspondence should be\r\ntaken into account, which might justify his indulging a little more than\r\nusual in self-praise, and it would have been perhaps almost impossible\r\nfor him to have remained entirely blind to his vast superiority over his\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nMany of the treatises which Galileo here mentions, as well as another on\r\ndialling, have been irrecoverably lost, through the superstitious\r\nweakness of some of his relations, who after his death suffered the\r\nfamily confessor to examine his papers, and to destroy whatever seemed\r\nto him objectionable; a portion which, according to the notions then\r\nprevalent, was like to comprise the most valuable part of the papers\r\nsubmitted to this expurgation. It is also supposed that many were burnt\r\nby his infatuated grandson Cosimo, who conceived he was thus offering a\r\nproper and pious sacrifice before devoting himself to the life of a\r\nmissionary. A Treatise on Fortification, by Galileo, was found in 1793,\r\nand is contained among the documents published by Venturi. Galileo does\r\nnot profess in it to give much original matter, but to lay before his\r\nreaders a compendium of the most approved principles then already known.\r\nIt has been supposed that Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden attended Galileo's\r\nlectures on this subject, whilst in Italy; but the fact is not\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained. Galileo himself mentions a Prince Gustavus\r\nof Sweden to whom he gave instruction in mathematics, but the dates\r\ncannot well be made to agree. The question deserves notice only from its\r\nhaving been made the subject of controversy.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Galileo's Essay on Continuous Quantity is particularly to be\r\nregretted, as it would be highly interesting to see how far he succeeded\r\nin methodizing his thoughts on this important topic. It is to his pupil\r\nCavalieri (who refused to publish his book so long as he hoped to see\r\nGalileo's printed) that we owe \"The Method of Indivisibles,\" which is\r\nuniversally recognized as one of the first germs of the powerful methods\r\nof modern analysis. Throughout Galileo's works we find many indications\r\nof his having thought much on the subject, but his remarks are vague,\r\nand bear little, if at all, on the application of the method. To this\r\nthe chief part of Cavalieri's book is devoted, though he was not so\r\nentirely regardless of the principles on which his method of measuring\r\nspaces is founded, as he is sometimes represented. This method consisted\r\nin considering lines as made up of an infinite number of points,\r\nsurfaces in like manner as composed of lines, and solids of surfaces;\r\nbut there is an observation at the beginning of the 7th book, which\r\nshews clearly that Cavalieri had taken a much more profound view of the\r\nsubject than is implied in this superficial exposition, and had\r\napproached very closely to the apparently more exact theories of his\r\nsuccessors. Anticipating the objections to his hypothesis, he argues,\r\nthat \"there is no necessity to suppose the continuous quantities made up\r\nof these indivisible parts, _but only that they will observe the same\r\nratios as those parts do_.\" It ought not to be omitted, that Kepler also\r\nhad given an impulse to Cavalieri in his \"New method of Gauging,\" which\r\nis the earliest work with which we are acquainted, where principles of\r\nthis sort are employed.[31]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] Vitæ Italorum Illustrium.\r\n\r\n[27] Almagestum Novum, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[28] Math.

It cannot be denied that his fame, as the\r\nfounder of the school of experimental philosophy, has been in an\r\nunmerited degree cast into the shade by the splendour of his\r\nastronomical discoveries; yet Lagrange[32] surely errs in the opposite\r\nextreme, when he almost denies that these form any real or solid part of\r\nthe glory of this great man; and Montucla[33] omits an important\r\ningredient in his merit, when he (in other respects very justly)\r\nremarks, that it required far less genius to point a telescope towards\r\nthe heavens than to trace the unheeded, because daily recurring,\r\nphenomena of motion up to its simple and primary laws. We are to\r\nremember that in the days of Galileo a telescope could scarcely be\r\npointed to the heavens with impunity, and that a courageous mind was\r\nrequired to contradict, and a strong one to bear down, a party, who,\r\nwhen invited to look on any object in the heavens which Aristotle had\r\nnever suspected, immediately refused all credit to those senses, to\r\nwhich, on other occasions, they so confidently appealed. It surely is a\r\nreal and solid part of Galileo's glory that he consumed his life in\r\nlaborious and indefatigable observations, and that he persevered in\r\nannouncing his discoveries undisgusted by the invectives, and undismayed\r\nby the persecutions, to which they subjected him. Plagiarist! liar!\r\nimpostor! heretic! were among the expressions of malignant hatred\r\nlavished upon him, and although he also was not without some violent and\r\nfoul-mouthed partisans, yet it must be told to his credit that he\r\nhimself seldom condescended to notice these torrents of abuse, otherwise\r\nthan by good-humoured retorts, and by prosecuting his observations with\r\nrenewed assiduity and zeal.\r\n\r\nThe use of single lenses in aid of the sight had been long known.\r\nSpectacles were in common use at the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and there are several hints, more or less obscure, in many\r\nearly writers, of the effects which might be expected from a combination\r\nof glasses; but it does not appear with certainty that any of these\r\nauthors had attempted to reduce their ideas to practice. After the\r\ndiscovery of the telescope, almost every country endeavoured to find in\r\nthe writings of its early philosophers traces of the knowledge of such\r\nan instrument, but in general with success very inadequate to the zeal\r\nof their national prepossessions. There are two authors especially to\r\nwhom the attention of Kepler and others was turned, immediately upon the\r\npromulgation of the discovery, as containing the germ of it in their\r\nworks. These are Baptista Porta, and Gerolamo Fracastoro. We have\r\nalready had occasion to quote the Homocentrica of Fracastoro, who died\r\nin 1553; the following expressions, though they seem to refer to actual\r\nexperiment, yet fall short of the meaning with which it has been\r\nattempted to invest them. After explaining and commenting on some\r\nphenomena of refraction through different media, to which he was led by\r\nthe necessity of reconciling his theory with the variable magnitudes of\r\nthe planets, he goes on to say—\"For which reason, those things which\r\nare seen at the bottom of water, appear greater than those which are at\r\nthe top; and if any one look through two eyeglasses, _one placed upon\r\nthe other_, he will see every thing much larger and nearer.\"[34] It\r\nshould seem that this passage (as Delambre has already remarked) rather\r\nrefers to the close application of one glass upon another, and it may\r\nfairly be doubted whether anything analogous to the composition of the\r\ntelescope was in the writer's thoughts. Baptista Porta writes on the\r\nsame subject more fully;—\"Concave lenses show distant objects most\r\nclearly, convex those which are nearer, whence they may be used to\r\nassist the sight. With a concave glass distant objects will be seen,\r\nsmall, but distinct; with a convex one those near at hand, larger, but\r\nconfused; _if you know rightly how to combine one of each sort, you\r\nwill see both far and near objects larger and clearer_.\"[35] These words\r\nshow, if Porta really was then unacquainted with the telescope, how\r\nclose it is possible to pass by an invention without lighting on it, for\r\nof precisely such a combination of a convex and concave lens, fitted to\r\nthe ends of an organ pipe by way of tube, did the whole of Galileo's\r\ntelescope consist. If Porta had stopped here he might more securely have\r\nenjoyed the reputation of the invention, but he then professes to\r\ndescribe the construction of his instrument, which has no relation\r\nwhatever to his previous remarks. \"I shall now endeavour to show in what\r\nmanner we may contrive to recognize our friends at the distance of\r\nseveral miles, and how those of weak sight may read the most minute\r\nletters from a distance. It is an invention of great utility, and\r\ngrounded on optical principles, nor is it at all difficult of execution;\r\nbut it must be so divulged as not to be understood by the vulgar, and\r\nyet be clear to the sharpsighted.\" The description which follows seems\r\nfar enough removed from the apprehended danger of being too clear, and\r\nindeed every writer who has hitherto quoted it has merely given the\r\npassage in its original Latin, apparently despairing of an intelligible\r\ntranslation. With some alterations in the punctuation, which appear\r\nnecessary to bring it into any grammatical construction,[36] it may be\r\nsupposed to bear something like the following meaning:—\"Let a view be\r\ncontrived in the centre of a mirror, where it is most effective. All the\r\nsolar rays are exceedingly dispersed, and do not in the least come\r\ntogether (in the true centre); but there is a concourse of all the rays\r\nin the central part of the said mirror, half way towards the other\r\ncentre, where the cross diameters meet. This view is contrived in the\r\nfollowing manner. A concave cylindrical mirror placed directly in front,\r\nbut with its axis inclined, must be adapted to that focus: and let\r\nobtuse angled or right angled triangles be cut out with two cross lines\r\non each side drawn from the centre, and a glass (_specillum_) will be\r\ncompleted fit for the purposes we mentioned.\" If it were not for the\r\nword \"_specillum_,\" which, in the passage immediately preceding this,\r\nPorta[37] contrasts with \"_speculum_,\" and which he afterwards explains\r\nto mean a glass lens, it would be very clear that the foregoing passage\r\n(supposing it to have any meaning) must be referred to a reflecting\r\ntelescope, and it is a little singular that while this obscure passage\r\nhas attracted universal attention, no one, so far as we are aware, has\r\ntaken any notice of the following unequivocal description of the\r\nprincipal part of Newton's construction of the same instrument. It is in\r\nthe 5th chapter of the 17th book, where Porta explains by what device\r\nexceedingly minute letters may be read without difficulty. \"Place a\r\nconcave mirror so that the back of it may lie against your breast;\r\nopposite to it, and within the burning point, place the writing; put a\r\nplane mirror behind it, that may be under your eyes. Then the images of\r\nthe letters which are in the concave mirror, and which the concave has\r\nmagnified, will be reflected in the plane mirror, so that you may read\r\nwithout difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nWe have not been able to meet with the Italian translation of Porta's\r\nNatural Magic, which was published in 1611, under his own\r\nsuperintendence; but the English translator of 1658 would probably have\r\nknown if any intelligible interpretation were there given of the\r\nmysterious passage above quoted, and his translation is so devoid of\r\nmeaning as strongly to militate against this idea. Porta, indeed,\r\nclaimed the invention as his own, and is believed to have hastened his\r\ndeath, (which happened in 1615, he being then 80 years old,) by the\r\nfatigue of composing a Treatise on the Telescope, in which he had\r\npromised to exhaust the subject. We do not know whether this is the same\r\nwork which was published after his death by Stelliola,[38] but which\r\ncontains no allusion to Porta's claim, and possibly Stelliola may have\r\nthought it most for his friend's reputation to suppress it. Schott[39]\r\nsays, a friend of his had seen Porta's book in manuscript, and that it\r\ndid at that time contain the assertion of Porta's title to the\r\ninvention. After all it is not improbable that he may have derived his\r\nnotions of magnifying distant objects from our celebrated countryman\r\nRoger Bacon, who died about the year 1300. He has been supposed, not\r\nwithout good grounds, to have been one of the first who recognised the\r\nuse of single lenses in producing distinct vision, and he has some\r\nexpressions with respect to their combination which promise effects\r\nanalogous to those held out by Porta. In \"The Admirable Force of Art and\r\nNature,\" he says, \"Physical figurations are far more strange, for in\r\nsuch manner may we frame perspects and looking-glasses that one thing\r\nshall appear to be many, as one man shall seeme a whole armie; and\r\ndivers sunnes and moones, yea, as many as we please, shall appeare at\r\none time, &c. And so may the perspects be framed, that things most farre\r\noff may seeme most nigh unto us, and clean contrarie, soe that we may\r\nreade very small letters an incredible distance from us, and behold\r\nthings how little soever they be, and make stars to appeare wheresoever\r\nwe will, &c. And, besides all these, we may so frame perspects that any\r\nman entering into a house he shall indeed see gold, and silver, and\r\nprecious stones, and what else he will, but when he maketh haste to the\r\nplace he shall find just nothing.\" It seems plain, that the author is\r\nhere speaking solely of mirrors, and we must not too hastily draw the\r\nconclusion, because in the first and last of these assertions he is, to\r\na certain extent, borne out by facts, that he therefore was in\r\npossession of a method of accomplishing the middle problem also. In the\r\nprevious chapter, he gives a long list of notable things, (much in the\r\nstyle of the Marquis of Worcester's Century of Inventions) which if we\r\ncan really persuade ourselves that he was capable of accomplishing, we\r\nmust allow the present age to be still immeasurably inferior to him in\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThomas Digges, in the preface to his Pantometria, (published in 1591)\r\ndeclares, \"My father, by his continuall painfull practises, assisted\r\nwith demonstrations mathematicall, was able, and sundry times hath by\r\nproportionall glasses, duely situate in convenient angles, not only\r\ndiscouered things farre off, read letters, numbered peeces of money,\r\nwith the verye coyne and superscription thereof, cast by some of his\r\nfreends of purpose, upon downes in open fields; but also, seuen miles\r\noff, declared what hath beene doone at that instant in priuate places.\r\nHe hath also sundrie times, by the sunne beames, fired powder and\r\ndischargde ordnance halfe a mile and more distante; which things I am\r\nthe boulder to report, for that there are yet living diverse (of these\r\nhis dooings) occulati testes, (eye witnesses) and many other matters\r\nfarre more strange and rare, which I omit as impertinent to this place.\"\r\n\r\nWe find another pretender to the honour of the discovery of the\r\ntelescope in the celebrated Antonio de Dominis, Archbishop of Spalatro,\r\nfamous in the annals of optics for being one of the first to explain the\r\ntheory of the rainbow. Montucla, following P. Boscovich, has scarcely\r\ndone justice to De Dominis, whom he treats as a mere pretender and\r\nignorant person. The indisposition of Boscovich towards him is\r\nsufficiently accounted for by the circumstance of his being a Catholic\r\nprelate who had embraced the cause of Protestantism. His nominal\r\nreconciliation with the Church of Rome would probably not have saved him\r\nfrom the stake, had not a natural death released him when imprisoned on\r\nthat account at Rome. Judgment was pronounced upon him notwithstanding,\r\nand his body and books were publicly burnt in the Campo de Fiori, in\r\n1624. His treatise, De Radiis, (which is very rarely to be met with) was\r\npublished by Bartolo after the acknowledged invention of the telescope\r\nby Galileo; but Bartolo tells us, in the preface, that the manuscript\r\nwas communicated to him from a collection of papers written 20 years\r\nbefore, on his inquiring the Archbishop's opinion with respect to the\r\nnewly discovered instrument, and that he got leave to publish it, \"with\r\nthe addition of one or two chapters.\" The treatise contains a complete\r\ndescription of a telescope, which, however, is professed merely to be an\r\nimprovement on spectacles, and if the author's intention had been to\r\ninterpolate an afterwritten account, in order to secure to himself the\r\nundeserved honour of the invention, it seems improbable that he would\r\nhave suffered an acknowledgment of additions, previous to publication,\r\nto be inserted in the preface. Besides, the whole tone of the work is\r\nthat of a candid and truth-seeking philosopher, very far indeed removed\r\nfrom being, as Montucla calls him, conspicuous for ignorance even among\r\nthe ignorant men of his age. He gives a drawing of a convex and concave\r\nlens, and traces the passage of the rays through them; to which he\r\nsubjoins, that he has not satisfied himself with any determination of\r\nthe precise distance to which the glasses should be separated, according\r\nto their convexity and concavity, but recommends the proper distance to\r\nbe found by actual experiment, and tells us, that the effect of the\r\ninstrument will be to prevent the confusion arising from the\r\ninterference of the direct and refracted rays, and to magnify the object\r\nby increasing the visible angle under which it is viewed. These, among\r\nthe many claimants, are certainly the authors who approached the most\r\nnearly to the discovery: and the reader may judge, from the passages\r\ncited, whether the knowledge of the telescope can with probability be\r\nreferred to a period earlier than the commencement of the 17th century.\r\nAt all events, we can find no earlier trace of its being applied to any\r\npractical use; the knowledge, if it existed, remained speculative and\r\nbarren.\r\n\r\nIn 1609, Galileo, then being on a visit to a friend at Venice, heard a\r\nrumour of the recent invention, by a Dutch spectacle-maker, of an\r\ninstrument which was said to represent distant objects nearer than they\r\nusually appeared. According to his own account, this general rumour,\r\nwhich was confirmed to him by letters from Paris, was all that he\r\nlearned on the subject; and returning to Padua, he immediately applied\r\nhimself to consider the means by which such an effect could be produced.\r\nFuccarius, in an abusive letter which he wrote on the subject, asserts\r\nthat one of the Dutch telescopes had been at that time actually brought\r\nto Venice, and that he (Fuccarius) had seen it; which, even if true, is\r\nperfectly consistent with Galileo's statement; and in fact the question,\r\nwhether or not Galileo saw the original instrument, becomes important\r\nonly from his expressly asserting the contrary, and professing to give\r\nthe train of reasoning by which he discovered its principle; so that any\r\ninsinuation that he had actually seen the Dutch glass, becomes a direct\r\nimpeachment of his veracity. It is certain, from the following extract\r\nof a letter from Lorenzo Pignoria to Paolo Gualdo, that one at least of\r\nthe Dutch glasses had been sent to Italy. It is dated Padua, 31st\r\nAugust, 1609.[40] \"We have no news, except the return of His Serene\r\nHighness, and the re-election of the lecturers, among whom Sign. Galileo\r\nhas contrived to get 1000 florins for life; and it is said to be on\r\naccount of an eyeglass, _like the one which was sent from Flanders to\r\nCardinal Borghese_. We have seen some here, and truly they succeed\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nIt is allowed by every one that the Dutchman, or rather Zealander, made\r\nhis discovery by mere accident, which greatly derogates from any honour\r\nattached to it; but even this diminished degree of credit has been\r\nfiercely disputed. According to one account, which appears consistent\r\nand probable, it had been made for sometime before its importance was in\r\nthe slightest degree understood or appreciated, but was set up in the\r\noptician's shop as a curious philosophical toy, showing a large and\r\ninverted image of a weathercock, towards which it was directed. The\r\nMarquis Spinola, chancing to see it, was struck with the phenomenon,\r\npurchased the instrument, and presented it either to the Archduke Albert\r\nof Austria, or to Prince Maurice of Nassau, whose name appears in every\r\nversion of the story, and who first entertained the idea of employing it\r\nin military reconnoissances.\r\n\r\nZacharias Jansen, and Henry Lipperhey, two spectacle-makers, living\r\nclose to each other, near the church of Middleburg, have both had\r\nstrenuous supporters of their title to the invention. A third pretender\r\nappeared afterwards in the person of James Metius of Alkmaer, who is\r\nmentioned by Huyghens and Des Cartes, but his claims rest upon no\r\nauthority whatever comparable to that which supports the other two.\r\nAbout half a century afterwards, Borelli was at the pains to collect and\r\npublish a number of letters and depositions which he procured, as well\r\non one side as on the other.[41] It seems that the truth lies between\r\nthem, and that one, probably Jansen, was the inventor of the\r\n_microscope_, which application of the principle was unquestionably of\r\nan earlier date, perhaps as far back as 1590. Jansen gave one of his\r\nmicroscopes to the Archduke, who gave it to Cornelius Drebbel, a\r\nsalaried mathematician at the court of our James the first, where\r\nWilliam Borelli (not the author above mentioned) saw it many years\r\nafterwards, when ambassador from the United Provinces to England, and\r\ngot from Drebbel this account of the quarter whence it came. Lipperhey\r\nafterwards, in 1609, accidentally hit upon the _telescope_, and on the\r\nfame of this discovery it would not be difficult for Jansen, already in\r\npossession of an instrument so much resembling it, to perceive the\r\nslight difference between them, and to construct a telescope\r\nindependently of Lipperhey, so that each, with some show of reason,\r\nmight claim the priority of the invention. A notion of this kind\r\nreconciles the testimony of many conflicting witnesses on the subject,\r\nsome of whom do not seem to distinguish very accurately whether the\r\ntelescope or microscope is the instrument to which their evidence\r\nrefers. Borelli arrives at the conclusion, that Jansen was the inventor;\r\nbut not satisfied with this, he endeavours, with a glaring partiality\r\nwhich makes his former determination suspicious, to secure for him and\r\nhis son the more solid reputation of having anticipated Galileo in the\r\nuseful employment of the invention. He has however inserted in his\r\ncollections a letter from John the son of Zacharias, in which John,\r\nomitting all mention of his father, speaks of his own observation of the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, evidently seeking to insinuate that they were\r\nearlier than Galileo's; and in this sense the letter has since been\r\nquoted,[42] although it appears from John's own deposition, preserved in\r\nthe same collection, that at the time of their discovery he could not\r\nhave been more than six years old. An oversight of this sort throws\r\ndoubt on the whole of the pretended observations, and indeed the letter\r\nhas much the air of being the production of a person imperfectly\r\ninformed on the subject on which he writes, and probably was compiled to\r\nsuit Borelli's purposes, which were to make Galileo's share in the\r\ninvention appear as small as possible.\r\n\r\nGalileo himself gives a very intelligible account of the process of\r\nreasoning, by which he detected the secret.—\"I argued in the following\r\nmanner. The contrivance consists either of one glass or of more—one is\r\nnot sufficient, since it must be either convex, concave, or plane; the\r\nlast does not produce any sensible alteration in objects, the concave\r\ndiminishes them: it is true that the convex magnifies, but it renders\r\nthem confused and indistinct; consequently, one glass is insufficient to\r\nproduce the desired effect. Proceeding to consider two glasses, and\r\nbearing in mind that the plane glass causes no change, I determined that\r\nthe instrument could not consist of the combination of a plane glass\r\nwith either of the other two. I therefore applied myself to make\r\nexperiments on combinations of the two other kinds, and thus obtained\r\nthat of which I was in search.\" It has been urged against Galileo that,\r\nif he really invented the telescope on theoretical principles, the same\r\ntheory ought at once to have conducted him to a more perfect instrument\r\nthan that which he at first constructed;[43] but it is plain, from this\r\nstatement, that he does not profess to have theorized beyond the\r\ndetermination of the species of glass which he should employ in his\r\nexperiments, and the rest of his operations he avows to have been purely\r\nempirical. Besides, we must take into account the difficulty of grinding\r\nthe glasses, particularly when fit tools were yet to be made, and\r\nsomething must be attributed to Galileo's eagerness to bring his results\r\nto the test of actual experiment, without waiting for that improvement\r\nwhich a longer delay might and did suggest. Galileo's language bears a\r\nresemblance to the first passage which we quoted from Baptista Porta,\r\nsufficiently close to make it not improbable that he might be assisted\r\nin his inquiries by some recollection of it, and the same passage seems,\r\nin like manner, to have recurred to the mind of Kepler, as soon as he\r\nheard of the invention. Galileo's telescope consisted of a plano-convex\r\nand plano-concave lens, the latter nearest the eye, distant from each\r\nother by the difference of their focal lengths, being, in principle,\r\nexactly the same with the modern opera-glass. He seems to have thought\r\nthat the Dutch glass was the same, but this could not be the case, if\r\nthe above quoted particular of the _inverted_ weathercock, which belongs\r\nto most traditions of the story, be correct; because it is the\r\npeculiarity of this kind of telescope not to invert objects, and we\r\nshould be thus furnished with a demonstrative proof of the falsehood of\r\nFuccarius's insinuation: in that case the Dutch glass must have been\r\nsimilar to what was afterwards called the astronomical telescope,\r\nconsisting of two convex glasses distant from each other by the sum of\r\ntheir focal lengths. This supposition is not controverted by the fact,\r\nthat this sort of telescope was never employed by astronomers till long\r\nafterwards; for the fame of Galileo's observations, and the superior\r\nexcellence of the instruments constructed under his superintendence,\r\ninduced every one in the first instance to imitate his constructions as\r\nclosely as possible. The astronomical telescope was however eventually\r\nfound to possess superior advantages over that which Galileo imagined,\r\nand it is on this latter principle that all modern refracting telescopes\r\nare constructed; the inversion being counteracted in those which are\r\nintended for terrestrial observations, by the introduction of a second\r\npair of similar glasses, which restore the inverted image to its\r\noriginal position. For further details on the improvements which have\r\nbeen subsequently introduced, and on the reflecting telescope, which was\r\nnot brought into use till the latter part of the century, the reader is\r\nreferred to the Treatise on OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nGalileo, about the same time, constructed microscopes on the same\r\nprinciple, for we find that, in 1612, he presented one to Sigismund,\r\nKing of Poland; but his attention being principally devoted to the\r\nemployment and perfection of his telescope, the microscope remained a\r\nlong time imperfect in his hands: twelve years later, in 1624, he wrote\r\nto P. Federigo Cesi, that he had delayed to send the microscope, the use\r\nof which he there describes, because he had only just brought it to\r\nperfection, having experienced some difficulty in working the glasses.\r\nSchott tells an amusing story, in his \"Magic of Nature,\" of a Bavarian\r\nphilosopher, who, travelling in the Tyrol with one of the newly invented\r\nmicroscopes about him, was taken ill on the road and died. The\r\nauthorities of the village took possession of his baggage, and were\r\nproceeding to perform the last duties to his body, when, on examining\r\nthe little glass instrument in his pocket, which chanced to contain a\r\nflea, they were struck with the greatest astonishment and terror, and\r\nthe poor Bavarian, condemned by acclamation as a sorcerer who was in the\r\nhabit of using a portable familiar, was declared unworthy of Christian\r\nburial. Fortunately for his character, some bold sceptic ventured to\r\nopen the instrument, and discovered the true nature of the imprisoned\r\nfiend.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Galileo's first telescope was completed, he returned with it\r\nto Venice, and the extraordinary sensation which it excited tends also\r\nstrongly to refute Fuccarius's assertion that the Dutch glass was\r\nalready known there. During more than a month Galileo's whole time was\r\nemployed in exhibiting his instrument to the principal inhabitants of\r\nVenice, who thronged to his house to satisfy themselves of the truth of\r\nthe wonderful stories in circulation; and at the end of that time the\r\nDoge, Leonardo Donati, caused it to be intimated to him that such a\r\npresent would not be deemed unacceptable by the senate. Galileo took the\r\nhint, and his complaisance was rewarded by a mandate confirming him for\r\nlife in his professorship at Padua, at the same time doubling his yearly\r\nsalary, which was thus made to amount to 1000 florins.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the phrenzy of public curiosity abated. Sirturi\r\ndescribes a ludicrous violence which was done to himself, when, with the\r\nfirst telescope which he had succeeded in making, he went up into the\r\ntower of St. Mark, at Venice, in the vain hope of being there entirely\r\nunmolested. Unluckily he was seen by some idlers in the street: a crowd\r\nsoon collected round him, who insisted on taking possession of his\r\ninstrument, and, handing it one to the other, detained him there for\r\nseveral hours till their curiosity was satiated, when he was allowed to\r\nreturn home. Hearing them also inquire eagerly at what inn he lodged, he\r\nthought it better to quit Venice early the next morning, and prosecute\r\nhis observations in a less inquisitive neighbourhood.[44] Instruments of\r\nan inferior description were soon manufactured, and vended every where\r\nas philosophical playthings, much in the way in which, in our own time,\r\nthe kaleidoscope spread over Europe as fast as travellers could carry\r\nthem. But the fabrication of a better sort was long confined, almost\r\nsolely, to Galileo and those whom he immediately instructed; and so late\r\nas the year 1637, we find Gaertner, or as he chose to call himself,\r\nHortensius, assuring Galileo that none could be met with in Holland\r\nsufficiently good to show Jupiter's disc well defined; and in 1634\r\nGassendi begs for a telescope from Galileo, informing him that he was\r\nunable to procure a good one either in Venice, Paris, or Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThe instrument, on its first invention, was generally known by the names\r\nof Galileo's tube, the perspective, the double eye-glass: the names of\r\ntelescope and microscope were suggested by Demisiano, as we are told by\r\nLagalla in his treatise on the Moon.[45]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Mecanique Analytique.\r\n\r\n[33] Histoire des Mathématiques, tom. ii.\r\n\r\n[34] \"Per duo specilla ocularia si quis perspiciat, altero alteri\r\nsuperposito, majora multo et propinquiora videbit omnia.\"—Fracast.\r\nHomocentrica, § 2, c. 8.\r\n\r\n[35] Si utrumque recte componere noveris, et longinqua et proxima majora\r\net clara videbis.—Mag.

After considering the\r\nbeautiful appearances which the varied surface of the moon presented to\r\nthis new instrument, he turned his telescope towards Jupiter, and his\r\nattention was soon arrested by the singular position of three small\r\nstars, near the body of that planet, which appeared almost in a straight\r\nline with it, and in the direction of the ecliptic. The following\r\nevening he was surprised to find that two of the three which had been to\r\nthe eastward of the planet, now appeared on the contrary side, which he\r\ncould not reconcile with the apparent motion of Jupiter among the fixed\r\nstars, as given by the tables. Observing these night after night, he\r\ncould not fail to remark that they changed their relative positions. A\r\nfourth also appeared, and in a short time he could no longer refuse to\r\nbelieve that these small stars were four moons, revolving round Jupiter\r\nin the same manner in which our earth is accompanied by its single\r\nattendant. In honour of his patron Cosmo, he named them the Medicæan\r\nstars. As they are now hardly known by this appellation, his doubts,\r\nwhether he should call them Medicæan, after Cosmo's family, or Cosmical,\r\nfrom his individual name, are become of less interest.\r\n\r\nAn extract from a letter which Galileo received on this occasion from\r\nthe court of France, will serve to show how highly the honour of giving\r\na name to these new planets was at that time appreciated, and also how\r\nmuch was expected from Galileo's first success in examining the heavens.\r\n\"The second request, but the most pressing one which I can make to you,\r\nis, that you should determine, if you discover any other fine star, to\r\ncall it by the name of the great star of France, as well as the most\r\nbrilliant of all the earth; and, if it seems fit to you, call it rather\r\nby his proper name of Henri, than by the family name of Bourbon: thus\r\nyou will have an opportunity of doing a thing just and due and proper in\r\nitself, and at the same time will render yourself and your family rich\r\nand powerful for ever.\" The writer then proceeds to enumerate the\r\ndifferent claims of Henri IV. to this honour, not forgetting that he\r\nmarried into the family of the Medici, &c.\r\n\r\nThe result of these observations was given to the world, in an Essay\r\nwhich Galileo entitled _Nuncius Sidereus_, or the Intelligencer of the\r\nStars; and it is difficult to describe the extraordinary sensation which\r\nits publication produced. Many doubted, many positively refused to\r\nbelieve, so novel an announcement; all were struck with the greatest\r\nastonishment, according to their respective opinions, either at the new\r\nview of the universe thus offered to them, or at the daring audacity of\r\nGalileo in inventing such fables. We shall proceed to extract a few\r\npassages from contemporary writers relative to this book, and the\r\ndiscoveries announced in it.\r\n\r\nKepler deserves precedence, both from his own celebrity, and from the\r\nlively and characteristic account which he gives of his first receiving\r\nthe intelligence:—\"I was sitting idle at home, thinking of you, most\r\nexcellent Galileo, and your letters, when the news was brought me of the\r\ndiscovery of four planets by the help of the double eye-glass.\r\nWachenfels stopped his carriage at my door to tell me, when such a fit\r\nof wonder seized me at a report which seemed so very absurd, and I was\r\nthrown into such agitation at seeing an old dispute between us decided\r\nin this way, that between his joy, my colouring, and the laughter of\r\nboth, confounded as we were by such a novelty, we were hardly capable,\r\nhe of speaking, or I of listening. My amazement was increased by the\r\nassertion of Wachenfels, that those who sent this news from Galileo were\r\ncelebrated men, far removed by their learning, weight, and character,\r\nabove vulgar folly; that the book was actually in the press, and would\r\nbe published immediately. On our separating, the authority of Galileo\r\nhad the greatest influence on me, earned by the accuracy of his\r\njudgment, and excellence of his understanding; so I immediately fell to\r\nthinking how there could be any addition to the number of the planets\r\nwithout overturning my Mysterium Cosmographicum, published thirteen\r\nyears ago, according to which Euclid's five regular solids do not allow\r\nmore than six planets round the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of the many wild notions of Kepler's fanciful brain, among\r\nwhich he was lucky enough at length to hit upon the real and principal\r\nlaws of the planetary motions. His theory may be briefly given in his\r\nown words:—\"The orbit of the earth is the measure of the rest. About it\r\ncircumscribe a dodecahedron. The sphere including this will be that of\r\nMars. About Mars' orbit describe a tetrahedron: the sphere containing\r\nthis will be Jupiter's orbit. Round Jupiter's describe a cube: the\r\nsphere including this will be Saturn's. Within the earth's orbit\r\ninscribe an icosahedron: the sphere inscribed in it will be Venus's\r\norbit. In Venus inscribe an octahedron: the sphere inscribed in it will\r\nbe Mercury's. You have now the reason of the number of the planets:\" for\r\nas there are no more than the five regular solids here enumerated,\r\nKepler conceived this to be a satisfactory reason why there could be\r\nneither more nor less than six planets. His letter continues:—\"I am so\r\nfar from disbelieving the existence of the four circumjovial planets,\r\nthat I long for a telescope to anticipate you, if possible, in\r\ndiscovering two round Mars, (as the proportion seems to me to require,)\r\nsix or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each round Mercury and\r\nVenus.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader has here an opportunity of verifying Galileo's observation,\r\nthat Kepler's method of philosophizing differed widely from his own. The\r\nproper line is certainly difficult to hit between the mere theorist and\r\nthe mere observer. It is not difficult at once to condemn the former,\r\nand yet the latter will deprive himself of an important, and often\r\nindispensable assistance, if he neglect from time to time to consolidate\r\nhis observations, and thence to conjecture the course of future\r\nobservation most likely to reward his assiduity. This cannot be more\r\nforcibly expressed than in the words of Leonardo da Vinci:[46] \"Theory\r\nis the general, experiments are the soldiers. The interpreter of the\r\nworks of nature is experiment; that is never wrong; it is our judgment\r\nwhich is sometimes deceived, because we are expecting results which\r\nexperiment refuses to give. We must consult experiment, and vary the\r\ncircumstances, till we have deduced general rules, for it alone can\r\nfurnish us with them. But you will ask, what is the use of these general\r\nrules? I answer, that they direct us in our inquiries into nature and\r\nthe operations of art. They keep us from deceiving ourselves and others,\r\nby promising ourselves results which we can never obtain.\"\r\n\r\nIn the instance before us, it is well known that, adopting some of the\r\nopinions of Bruno and Brutti, Galileo, even before he had seen the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, had allowed the possibility of the discovery of\r\nnew planets; and we can scarcely suppose that they had weakened his\r\nbelief in the probability of further success, or discouraged him from\r\nexamining the other heavenly bodies. Kepler on the contrary had taken\r\nthe opposite side of the argument; but no sooner was the fallacy of his\r\nfirst position undeniably demonstrated, than, passing at once from one\r\nextreme to the other, he framed an unsupported theory to account for the\r\nnumber of satellites which were round Jupiter, and for those which he\r\nexpected to meet with elsewhere. Kepler has been styled the legislator\r\nof the skies; his laws were promulgated rather too arbitrarily, and they\r\noften failed, as all laws must do which are not drawn from a careful\r\nobservation of the nature of those who are to be governed by them.\r\nAstronomers have reason to be grateful for the theorems which he was the\r\nfirst to establish; but so far as regards the progress of the science of\r\ninductive reasoning, it is perhaps to be regretted, that the seventeen\r\nyears which he wasted in random and unconnected guesses should have been\r\nfinally rewarded, by discoveries splendid enough to shed deceitful\r\nlustre upon the method by which he arrived at them.\r\n\r\nGalileo himself clearly perceived the fallacious nature of these\r\nspeculations on numbers and proportions, and has expressed his\r\nsentiments concerning them very unequivocally. \"How great and common an\r\nerror appears to me the mistake of those who persist in making their\r\nknowledge and apprehension the measure of the apprehension and knowledge\r\nof God; as if that alone were perfect, which they understand to be so.\r\nBut I, on the contrary, observe that Nature has other scales of\r\nperfection, which we cannot comprehend, and rather seem disposed to\r\nclass among imperfections. For instance, among the relations of\r\ndifferent numbers, those appear to us most perfect which exist between\r\nnumbers nearly related to each other; as the double, the triple, the\r\nproportion of three to two, &c.; those appear less perfect which exist\r\nbetween numbers remote from, and prime to each other; as 11 to 7, 17 to\r\n13, 53 to 37, &c.; and most imperfect of all do those appear which exist\r\nbetween incommensurable quantities, which by us are nameless and\r\ninexplicable. Consequently, if the task had been given to a man, of\r\nestablishing and ordering the rapid motions of the heavenly bodies,\r\naccording to his notions of perfect proportions, I doubt not that he\r\nwould have arranged them according to the former rational proportions;\r\nbut, on the contrary, God, with no regard to our imaginary symmetries,\r\nhas ordered them in proportions not only incommeasurable and irrational,\r\nbut altogether inappreciable by our intellect. A man ignorant of\r\ngeometry may perhaps lament, that the circumference of a circle does not\r\nhappen to be exactly three times the diameter, or in some other\r\nassignable proportion to it, rather than such that we have not yet been\r\nable to explain what the ratio between them is; but one who has more\r\nunderstanding will know that if they were other than they are, thousands\r\nof admirable conclusions would have been lost, and that none of the\r\nother properties of the circle would have been true: the surface of the\r\nsphere would not be quadruple of a great circle, nor the cylinder be to\r\nthe sphere as three to two: in short, no part of geometry would be true,\r\nand as it now is. If one of our most celebrated architects had had to\r\ndistribute this vast multitude of fixed stars through the great vault of\r\nheaven, I believe he would have disposed them with beautiful\r\narrangements of squares, hexagons, and octagons; he would have dispersed\r\nthe larger ones among the middle sized and the less, so as to correspond\r\nexactly with each other; and then he would think he had contrived\r\nadmirable proportions: but God, on the contrary, has shaken them out\r\nfrom His hand as if by chance, and we, forsooth, must think that He has\r\nscattered them up yonder without any regularity, symmetry, and\r\nelegance.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking that the dangerous ideas of aptitude and\r\ncongruence of numbers had taken such deep and general root, that long\r\nafterwards, when the reality of Jupiter's satellites was incontestably\r\nestablished, and Huyghens had discovered a similar satellite near\r\nSaturn, he was so rash as to declare his belief, (unwarned by the vast\r\nprogress which astronomy had made in his own time,) that no more\r\nsatellites would be discovered, since the one which he discovered near\r\nSaturn, with Jupiter's four, and our moon, made up the number six,\r\nexactly equal to the number of the principal planets. Every reader knows\r\nthat this notion, so unworthy the genius of Huyghens, has been since\r\nexploded by the discovery both of new planets, and new satellites.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Sizzi, a Florentine astronomer, took the matter up in a\r\nsomewhat different strain from Kepler.[47]—\"There are seven windows\r\ngiven to animals in the domicile of the head, through which the air is\r\nadmitted to the rest of the tabernacle of the body, to enlighten, to\r\nwarm, and nourish it, which are the principal parts of the μικροκοσμος\r\n(or little world); two nostrils, two eyes, two ears, and a mouth; so in\r\nthe heavens, as in a μακροκοσμος (or great world), there are two\r\nfavourable stars, two unpropitious, two luminaries, and Mercury alone\r\nundecided and indifferent. From which and many other similar phenomena\r\nof nature, such as the seven metals, &c., which it were tedious to\r\nenumerate, we gather that the number of planets is necessarily seven.\r\nMoreover, the satellites are invisible to the naked eye, and therefore\r\ncan exercise no influence on the earth, and therefore would be useless,\r\nand therefore do not exist. Besides, as well the Jews and other ancient\r\nnations as modern Europeans have adopted the division of the week into\r\nseven days, and have named them from the seven planets: now if we\r\nincrease the number of the planets this whole system falls to the\r\nground.\" To these remarks Galileo calmly replied, that whatever their\r\nforce might be, as a reason for believing beforehand that no more than\r\nseven planets would be discovered, they hardly seemed of sufficient\r\nweight to destroy the new ones when actually seen.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, took a more dogged line of opposition, without venturing\r\ninto the subtle analogies and arguments of the philosopher just cited.\r\nThey contented themselves, and satisfied others, with the simple\r\nassertion, that such things were not, and could not be, and the manner\r\nin which they maintained themselves in their incredulity was\r\nsufficiently ludicrous. \"Oh, my dear Kepler,\"[48] says Galileo, \"how I\r\nwish that we could have one hearty laugh together. Here, at Padua, is\r\nthe principal professor of philosophy, whom I have repeatedly and\r\nurgently requested to look at the moon and planets through my glass,\r\nwhich he pertinaciously refuses to do. Why are you not here? what shouts\r\nof laughter we should have at this glorious folly! and to hear the\r\nprofessor of philosophy at Pisa labouring before the grand duke with\r\nlogical arguments, as if with magical incantations, to charm the new\r\nplanets out of the sky.\"\r\n\r\nAnother opponent of Galileo deserves to be named, were it only for the\r\nsingular impudence of the charge he ventures to bring against him. \"We\r\nare not to think,\" says Christmann, in the Appendix to his _Nodus\r\nGordius_, \"that Jupiter has four satellites given him by nature, in\r\norder, by revolving round him, to immortalize the name of the Medici,\r\nwho first had notice of the observation. These are the dreams of _idle\r\nmen_, who love ludicrous ideas better than our laborious and industrious\r\ncorrection of the heavens.—Nature abhors so horrible a chaos, and to\r\nthe truly wise such vanity is detestable.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo was also urged by the astrologers to attribute some influence,\r\naccording to their fantastic notions, to the satellites, and the account\r\nwhich he gives his friend Dini of his answer to one of this class is\r\nwell worth extracting, as a specimen of his method of uniting sarcasm\r\nwith serious expostulation; \"I must,\" says he, \"tell you what I said a\r\nfew days back to one of those nativity-casters, who believe that God,\r\nwhen he created the heavens and the stars, had no thoughts beyond what\r\nthey can themselves conceive, in order to free myself from his tedious\r\nimportunity; for he protested, that unless I would declare to him the\r\neffect of the Medicæan planets, he would reject and deny them as\r\nneedless and superfluous. I believe this set of men to be of Sizzi's\r\nopinion, that astronomers discovered the other seven planets, not by\r\nseeing them corporally in the skies, but only from their effects on\r\nearth,—much in the manner in which some houses are discovered to be\r\nhaunted by evil spirits, not by seeing them, but from the extravagant\r\npranks which are played there. I replied, that he ought to reconsider\r\nthe hundred or thousand opinions which, in the course of his life, he\r\nmight have given, and particularly to examine well the events which he\r\nhad predicted with the help of Jupiter, and if he should find that all\r\nhad succeeded conformably to his predictions, I bid him prophecy merrily\r\non, according to his old and wonted rules; for I assured him that the\r\nnew planets would not in any degree affect the things which are already\r\npast, and that in future he would not be a less fortunate conjuror than\r\nhe had been: but if, on the contrary, he should find the events\r\ndepending on Jupiter, in some trifling particulars not to have agreed\r\nwith his dogmas and prognosticating aphorisms, he ought to set to work\r\nto find new tables for calculating the constitution of the four Jovial\r\ncirculators at every bygone moment, and, perhaps, from the diversity of\r\ntheir aspects, he would be able, with accurate observations and\r\nmultiplied conjunctions, to discover the alterations and variety of\r\ninfluences depending upon them; and I reminded him, that in ages past\r\nthey had not acquired knowledge with little labour, at the expense of\r\nothers, from written books, but that the first inventors acquired the\r\nmost excellent knowledge of things natural and divine with study and\r\ncontemplation of the vast book which nature holds ever open before those\r\nwho have eyes in their forehead and in their brain; and that it was a\r\nmore honourable and praiseworthy enterprize with their own watching,\r\ntoil, and study, to discover something admirable and new among the\r\ninfinite number which yet remain concealed in the darkest depths of\r\nphilosophy, than to pass a listless and lazy existence, labouring only\r\nto darken the toilsome inventions of their neighbours, in order to\r\nexcuse their own cowardice and inaptitude for reasoning, while they cry\r\nout that nothing can be added to the discoveries already made.\"\r\n\r\nThe extract given above from Kepler, is taken from an Essay, published\r\nwith the later editions of the _Nuncius_, the object and spirit of which\r\nseem to have been greatly misunderstood, even by some of Kepler's\r\nintimate friends.—They considered it as a covert attack upon Galileo,\r\nand, accordingly, Maestlin thus writes to him:—\"In your Essay (which I\r\nhave just received) you have plucked Galileo's feathers well; I mean,\r\nthat you have shown him not to be the inventor of the telescope, not to\r\nhave been the first who observed the irregularities of the moon's\r\nsurface, not to have been the first discoverer of more worlds than the\r\nancients were acquainted with, &c. One source of exultation was still\r\nleft him, from the apprehension of which Martin Horky has now entirely\r\ndelivered me.\" It is difficult to discover in what part of Kepler's book\r\nMaestlin found all this, for it is one continued encomium upon Galileo;\r\ninsomuch that Kepler almost apologizes in the preface for what may seem\r\nhis intemperate admiration of his friend. \"Some might wish I had spoken\r\nin more moderate terms in praise of Galileo, in consideration of the\r\ndistinguished men who are opposed to his opinions, but I have written\r\nnothing fulsome or insincere. I praise him, for myself; I leave other\r\nmen's judgments free; and shall be ready to join in condemnation when\r\nsome one wiser than myself shall, by sound reasoning, point out his\r\nerrors.\" However, Maestlin was not the only one who misunderstood\r\nKepler's intentions: the Martin Horky of whom he speaks, a young German,\r\nalso signalized himself by a vain attack upon the book which he thought\r\nhis patron Kepler condemned. He was then travelling in Italy, whence he\r\nwrote to Kepler his first undetermined thoughts about the new\r\ndiscoveries. \"They are wonderful; they are stupendous; whether they are\r\ntrue or false I cannot tell.\"[49] He seems soon to have decided that\r\nmost reputation was to be gained on the side of Galileo's opponents, and\r\nhis letters accordingly became filled with the most rancorous abuse of\r\nhim. At the same time, that the reader may appreciate Horky's own\r\ncharacter, we shall quote a short sentence at the end of one of his\r\nletters, where he writes of a paltry piece of dishonesty with as great\r\nglee as if he had solved an ingenious and scientific problem. After\r\nmentioning his meeting Galileo at Bologna, and being indulged with a\r\ntrial of his telescope, which, he says, \"does wonders upon the earth,\r\nbut represents celestial objects falsely;\"[50] he concludes with the\r\nfollowing honourable sentence:—\"I must confide to you a theft which I\r\ncommitted. I contrived to take a mould of the glass in wax, without the\r\nknowledge of any one, and, when I get home, I trust to make a telescope\r\neven better than Galileo's own.\"\r\n\r\nHorky having declared to Kepler, \"I will never concede his four new\r\nplanets to that Italian from Padua though I die for it,\" followed up\r\nthis declaration by publishing a book against Galileo, which is the one\r\nalluded to by Maestlin, as having destroyed the little credit which,\r\naccording to his view, Kepler's publication had left him. This book\r\nprofesses to contain the examination of four principal questions\r\ntouching the alleged planets; 1st, Whether they exist? 2nd, What they\r\nare? 3rd, What they are like? 4th, Why they are? The first question is\r\nsoon disposed of, by Horky's declaring positively that he has examined\r\nthe heavens with Galileo's own glass, and that no such thing as a\r\nsatellite about Jupiter exists. To the second, he declares solemnly,\r\nthat he does not more surely know that he has a soul in his body, than\r\nthat reflected rays are the sole cause of Galileo's erroneous\r\nobservations. In regard to the third question, he says, that these\r\nplanets are like the smallest fly compared to an elephant; and, finally,\r\nconcludes on the fourth, that the only use of them is to gratify\r\nGalileo's \"thirst of gold,\" and to afford himself a subject of\r\ndiscussion.[51]\r\n\r\nGalileo did not condescend to notice this impertinent folly; it was\r\nanswered by Roffini, a pupil of Magini, and by a young Scotchman of the\r\nname of Wedderburn, then a student at Padua, and afterwards a physician\r\nat the Court of Vienna. In the latter reply we find it mentioned, that\r\nGalileo was also using his telescope for the examination of insects,\r\n&c.[52] Horky sent his performance triumphantly to Kepler, and, as he\r\nreturned home before receiving an answer, he presented himself before\r\nhis patron in the same misapprehension under which he had written, but\r\nthe philosopher received him with a burst of indignation which rapidly\r\nundeceived him. The conclusion of the story is characteristic enough to\r\nbe given in Kepler's own account of the matter to Galileo, in which,\r\nafter venting his wrath against this \"scum of a fellow,\" whose\r\n\"obscurity had given him audacity,\" he says, that Horky begged so hard\r\nto be forgiven, that \"I have taken him again into favour upon this\r\npreliminary condition, to which he has agreed:—that I am to shew him\r\nJupiter's satellites, AND HE IS TO SEE THEM, and own that they are\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same letter Kepler writes, that although he has himself perfect\r\nconfidence in the truth of Galileo's assertions, yet he wishes he could\r\nfurnish him with some corroborative testimonies, which Kepler could\r\nquote in arguing the point with others. This request produced the\r\nfollowing reply, from which the reader will also learn the new change\r\nwhich had now taken place in Galileo's fortunes, the result of the\r\ncorrespondence with Florence, part of which we have already\r\nextracted.[53] \"In the first place, I return you my thanks that you\r\nfirst, and almost alone, before the question had been sifted (such is\r\nyour candour and the loftiness of your mind), put faith in my\r\nassertions. You tell me you have some telescopes, but not sufficiently\r\ngood to magnify distant objects with clearness, and that you anxiously\r\nexpect a sight of mine, which magnifies images more than a thousand\r\ntimes. It is mine no longer, for the Grand Duke of Tuscany has asked it\r\nof me, and intends to lay it up in his museum, among his most rare and\r\nprecious curiosities, in eternal remembrance of the invention: I have\r\nmade no other of equal excellence, for the mechanical labour is very\r\ngreat: I have, however, devised some instruments for figuring and\r\npolishing them which I am unwilling to construct here, as they could not\r\nconveniently be carried to Florence, where I shall in future reside. You\r\nask, my dear Kepler, for other testimonies:—I produce, for one, the\r\nGrand Duke, who, after observing the Medicæan planets several times with\r\nme at Pisa during the last months, made me a present, at parting, worth\r\nmore than a thousand florins, and has now invited me to attach myself to\r\nhim with the annual salary of one thousand florins, and with the title\r\nof Philosopher and Principal Mathematician to His Highness; without the\r\nduties of any office to perform, but with the most complete leisure; so\r\nthat I can complete my Treatises on Mechanics, on the Constitution of\r\nthe Universe, and on Natural and Violent Local Motion, of which I have\r\ndemonstrated geometrically many new and admirable phenomena. I produce,\r\nfor another witness, myself, who, although already endowed in this\r\ncollege with the noble salary of one thousand florins, such as no\r\nprofessor of mathematics ever before received, and which I might\r\nsecurely enjoy during my life, even if these planets had deceived me and\r\nshould disappear, yet quit this situation, and betake me where want and\r\ndisgrace will be my punishment should I prove to have been mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult not to regret that Galileo should be thus called on to\r\nresign his best glasses, but it appears probable that on becoming more\r\nfamiliar with the Grand Duke, he ventured to suggest that this telescope\r\nwould be more advantageously employed in his own hands, than pompously\r\nlaid up in a museum; for in 1637 we find him saying, in answer to a\r\nrequest from his friend Micanzio to send him a telescope—\"I am sorry\r\nthat I cannot oblige you with the glasses for your friend, but I am no\r\nlonger capable of making them, and I have just parted with two tolerably\r\ngood ones which I had, reserving only my old discoverer of celestial\r\nnovelties which is already promised to the Grand Duke.\" Cosmo was dead\r\nin 1637, and it is his son Ferdinand who is here meant, who appears to\r\nhave inherited his father's love of science. Galileo tells us, in the\r\nsame letter, that Ferdinand had been amusing himself for some months\r\nwith making object-glasses, and always carried one with him to work at\r\nwherever he went.\r\n\r\nWhen forwarding this telescope to Cosmo in the first instance, Galileo\r\nadds, with a very natural feeling—\"I send it to his highness unadorned\r\nand unpolished, as I made it for my own use, and beg that it may always\r\nbe left in the same state; for none of the old parts ought to be\r\ndisplaced to make room for new ones, which will have had no share in the\r\nwatchings and fatigues of these observations.\" A telescope was in\r\nexistence, though with the object glass broken, at the end of the last\r\ncentury, and probably still is in the Museum at Florence, which was\r\nshewn as the discoverer of Jupiter's satellites. Nelli, on whose\r\nauthority this is mentioned, appears to question its genuineness. The\r\nfirst reflecting telescope, made with Newton's own hands, and scarcely\r\npossessing less interest than the first of Galileo's, is preserved in\r\nthe library of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the enemies of Galileo and of the new stars found it\r\nimpossible to persevere in their disbelief, whether real or pretended,\r\nand at length seemed resolved to compensate for the sluggishness of\r\ntheir perception, by its acuteness when brought into action. Simon Mayer\r\npublished his \"Mundus Jovialis\" in 1614, in which he claims to have been\r\nan original observer of the satellites, but, with an affectation of\r\ncandour, allows that Galileo observed them probably about the same time.\r\nThe earliest observation which he has recorded is dated 29th December,\r\n1609, but, not to mention the total want of probability that Mayer would\r\nnot have immediately published so interesting a discovery, it is to be\r\nobserved, that, as he used the old style, this date of 29th December\r\nagrees with the 8th January, 1610, of the new style, which was the date\r\nof Galileo's second observation, and Galileo ventured to declare his\r\nopinion, that this pretended observation was in fact a plagiarism.\r\n\r\nScheiner counted five, Rheita nine, and other observers, with increasing\r\ncontempt for Galileo's imperfect announcements, carried the number as\r\nhigh as twelve.[54] In imitation of Galileo's nomenclature, and to\r\nhonour the sovereigns of the respective observers, these supposed\r\nadditional satellites were dignified with the names of Vladislavian,\r\nAgrippine, Urbanoctavian, and Ferdinandotertian planets; but a very\r\nshort time served to show it was as unsafe to exceed as to fall short of\r\nthe number which Galileo had fixed upon, for Jupiter rapidly removed\r\nhimself from the neighbourhood of the fixed stars, which gave rise to\r\nthese pretended discoveries, carrying with him only his four original\r\nattendants, which continued in every part of his orbit to revolve\r\nregularly about him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we cannot better wind up this account of the discovery of\r\nJupiter's satellites, and of the intense interest they have at all times\r\ninspired, than in the words of one who inherits a name worthy to be\r\nranked with that of Galileo in the list of astronomical discoverers, and\r\nwho takes his own place among the most accomplished mathematicians of\r\nthe present times. \"The discovery of these bodies was one of the first\r\nbrilliant results of the invention of the telescope; one of the first\r\ngreat facts which opened the eyes of mankind to the system of the\r\nuniverse, which taught them the comparative insignificance of their own\r\nplanet, and the superior vastness and nicer mechanism of those other\r\nbodies, which had before been distinguished from the stars only by their\r\nmotion, and wherein none but the boldest thinkers had ventured to\r\nsuspect a community of nature with our own globe. This discovery gave\r\nthe holding turn to the opinions of mankind respecting the Copernican\r\nsystem; the analogy presented by these little bodies (little however\r\nonly in comparison with the great central body about which they revolve)\r\nperforming their beautiful revolutions in perfect harmony and order\r\nabout it, being too strong to be resisted. This elegant system was\r\nwatched with all the curiosity and interest the subject naturally\r\ninspired. The eclipses of the satellites speedily attracted attention,\r\nand the more when it was discerned, as it speedily was, by Galileo\r\nhimself, that they afforded a ready method of determining the difference\r\nof longitudes of distant places on the earth's surface, by observations\r\nof the instants of their disappearances and reappearances,\r\nsimultaneously made. Thus the first astronomical solution of the great\r\nproblem of the longitude, the first mighty step which pointed out a\r\nconnection between speculative astronomy and practical utility, and\r\nwhich, replacing the fast dissipating dreams of astrology by nobler\r\nvisions, showed how the stars might really, and without fiction, be\r\ncalled arbiters of the destinies of empires, we owe to the satellites of\r\nJupiter, those atoms imperceptible to the naked eye, and floating like\r\nmotes in the beam of their primary—itself an atom to our sight, noticed\r\nonly by the careless vulgar as a large star, and by the philosophers of\r\nformer ages as something moving among the stars, they knew not what, nor\r\nwhy: perhaps only to perplex the wise with fruitless conjectures, and\r\nharass the weak with fears as idle as their theories.\"[55]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] Venturi.

His observations on the moon\r\nthrew additional light on the constitution of the solar system, and\r\ncleared up the difficulties which encumbered the explanation of the\r\nvaried appearance of her surface. The different theories current at that\r\nday, to account for these phenomena, are collected and described by\r\nBenedetti, and also with some liveliness, in a mythological poem, by\r\nMarini.[56] We are told, that, in the opinion of some, the dark shades\r\non the moon's surface arise from the interposition of opaque bodies\r\nfloating between her and the sun, which prevents his light from reaching\r\nthose parts: others thought, that on account of her vicinity to the\r\nearth, she was partly tainted with the imperfection of our terrestrial\r\nand elementary nature, and was not of that entirely pure and refined\r\nsubstance of which the more remote heavens consist: a third party looked\r\non her as a vast mirror, and maintained that the dark parts of her\r\nsurface were the reflected images of our earthly forests and mountains.\r\n\r\nGalileo's glass taught him to believe that the surface of this planet,\r\nfar from being smooth and polished, as was generally taken for granted,\r\nreally resembled our earth in its structure; he was able distinctly to\r\ntrace on it the outlines of mountains and other inequalities, the\r\nsummits of which reflected the rays of the sun before these reached the\r\nlower parts, and the sides of which, turned from his beams, lay buried\r\nin deep shadow. He recognised a distribution into something similar to\r\ncontinents of land, and oceans of water, which reflect the sun's light\r\nto us with greater or less vivacity, according to their constitution.\r\nThese conclusions were utterly odious to the Aristotelians; they had\r\nformed a preconceived notion of what the moon ought to be, and they\r\nloathed the doctrines of Galileo, who took delight, as they said, in\r\ndistorting and ruining the fairest works of nature. It was in vain he\r\nargued, as to the imaginary perfection of the spherical form, that\r\nalthough the moon, or the earth, were it absolutely smooth, would indeed\r\nbe a more perfect sphere than in its present rough state, yet touching\r\nthe perfection of the earth, considered as a natural body calculated for\r\na particular purpose, every one must see that absolute smoothness and\r\nsphericity would make it not only less perfect, but as far from being\r\nperfect as possible. \"What else,\" he demanded, \"would it be but a vast\r\nunblessed desert, void of animals, of plants, of cities and of men; the\r\nabode of silence and inaction; senseless, lifeless, soulless, and stript\r\nof all those ornaments which make it now so various and so beautiful?\"\r\n\r\nHe reasoned to no purpose with the slaves of the ancient schools:\r\nnothing could console them for the destruction of their smooth\r\nunalterable surface, and to such an absurd length was this hallucination\r\ncarried, that one opponent of Galileo, Lodovico delle Colombe,\r\nconstrained to allow the evidence of the sensible inequalities of the\r\nmoon's surface, attempted to reconcile the old doctrine with the new\r\nobservations, by asserting, that every part of the moon, which to the\r\nterrestrial observer appeared hollow and sunken, was in fact entirely\r\nand exactly filled up with a clear crystal substance, perfectly\r\nimperceptible by the senses, but which restored to the moon her\r\naccurately spherical and smooth surface. Galileo met the argument in the\r\nmanner most fitting, according to one of Aristotle's own maxims, that\r\n\"it is foolish to refute absurd opinions with too much curiosity.\"\r\n\"Truly,\" says he, \"the idea is admirable, its only fault is that it is\r\nneither demonstrated nor demonstrable; but I am perfectly ready to\r\nbelieve it, provided that, with equal courtesy, I may be allowed to\r\nraise upon your smooth surface, crystal mountains (which nobody can\r\nperceive) ten times higher than those which I have actually seen and\r\nmeasured.\" By threatening to proceed to such extremities, he seems to\r\nhave scared the opposite party into moderation, for we do not find that\r\nthe crystalline theory was persevered in.\r\n\r\nIn the same essay, Galileo also explained at some length the cause of\r\nthat part of the moon being visible, which is unenlightened directly by\r\nthe sun in her first and last quarter. Maestlin, and before him Leonardo\r\nda Vinci, had already declared this to arise from what may be called\r\n_earthshine_, or the reflection of the sun's light from the terrestrial\r\nglobe, exactly similar to that which the moon affords us when we are\r\nsimilarly placed between her and the sun; but the notion had not been\r\nfavourably received, because one of the arguments against the earth\r\nbeing a planet, revolving like the rest round the sun, was, that it did\r\nnot shine like them, and was therefore of a different nature; and this\r\nargument, weak as it was in itself, the theory of terrestrial reflection\r\ncompletely overturned. The more popular opinions ascribed this feeble\r\nlight, some to the fixed stars, some to Venus, some to the rays of the\r\nsun, penetrating and shining through the moon. Even the sagacious\r\nBenedetti adopted the notion of this light being caused by Venus, in the\r\nsame sentence in which he explains the true reason of the faint light\r\nobserved during a total eclipse of the moon, pointing out that it is\r\noccasioned by those rays of the sun, which reach the moon, after being\r\nbent round the sides of the earth by the action of our atmosphere.[57]\r\n\r\nGalileo also announced the detection of innumerable stars, invisible to\r\nthe unassisted sight; and those remarkable appearances in the heavens,\r\ngenerally called nebulæ, the most considerable of which is familiar to\r\nall under the name of the milky way, when examined by his instrument,\r\nwere found to resolve themselves into a vast collection of minute stars,\r\ntoo closely congregated to produce a separate impression upon the\r\nunassisted eye.[58] Benedetti, who divined that the dark shades on the\r\nmoon's surface arose from the constitution of those parts which suffered\r\nmuch of the light to pass into them, and consequently reflected a less\r\nportion of it, had maintained that the milky way was the result of the\r\nconverse of the same phenomenon, and declared, in the language of his\r\nastronomy, that it was a part of the eighth orb, which did not, like the\r\nrest, allow the sun's light to traverse it freely, but reflected a small\r\npart feebly to our sight.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Copernicans would probably have been well pleased, if by these\r\neternally renewed discussions and disputes, they could have occupied\r\nGalileo's time sufficiently to detain his attention from his telescope\r\nand astronomical observations; but he knew too well where his real\r\nstrength lay, and they had scarcely time to compound any thing like an\r\nargument against him and his theories, before they found him in\r\npossession of some new facts, which they were unprepared to meet,\r\notherwise than by the never-failing resource of abuse and affected\r\ncontempt. The year had not expired before Galileo had new intelligence\r\nto communicate of the highest importance. Perhaps he had been taught\r\ncaution from the numerous piracies which had been committed upon his\r\ndiscoveries, and he first announced his new discoveries enigmatically,\r\nveiling their real import by transpositions of the letters in the words\r\nwhich described them, (a practice then common, and not disused even at a\r\nmuch later date,) and inviting all astronomers to declare, within a\r\ncertain time, if they had noted any thing new in the heavens worthy of\r\nobservation. The transposed letters which he published were—\r\n\r\n    \"_Smaismrmilme poeta leumi bvne nugttaviras._\"\r\n\r\nKepler, in the true spirit of his riddling philosophy, endeavoured to\r\ndecypher the meaning, and fancied he had succeeded when he formed a\r\nbarbarous Latin verse,\r\n\r\n    \"_Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia proles_,\"\r\n\r\nconceiving that the discovery, whatever it might be, related to the\r\nplanet Mars, to which Kepler's attention had before been particularly\r\ndirected. The reader, however, need not weary himself in seeking a\r\ntranslation of this solution, for at the request of the Emperor Rodolph,\r\nGalileo speedily sent to him the real reading—\r\n\r\n    _Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi_;\r\n\r\nthat is, \"I have observed that the most distant planet is triple,\" or,\r\nas he further explains the matter, \"I have with great admiration\r\nobserved that Saturn is not a single star, but three together, which as\r\nit were touch each other; they have no relative motion, and are\r\nconstituted in this form [Symbol: oOo] the middle being somewhat larger\r\nthan the lateral ones. If we examine them with an eye-glass which\r\nmagnifies the surface less than 1000 times, the three stars do not\r\nappear very distinctly, but Saturn has an oblong appearance, like the\r\nappearance of an olive, thus [Symbol: horizontal 0]. Now I have\r\ndiscovered a court for Jupiter, and two servants for this old man, who\r\naid his steps and never quit his side.\" Galileo was, however, no match\r\nin this style of writing for Kepler, who disapproved his friend's\r\nmetaphor, and, in his usual fanciful and amusing strain,—\"I will not,\"\r\nsaid he, \"make an old man of Saturn, nor slaves of his attendant globes,\r\nbut rather let this tricorporate form be Geryon, so shall Galileo be\r\nHercules, and the telescope his club; armed with which, he has conquered\r\nthat distant planet, and dragged him from the remotest depths of nature,\r\nand exposed him to the view of all.\" Galileo's glass was not of\r\nsufficient power to shew him the real constitution of this extraordinary\r\nplanet; it was reserved for Huyghens, about the year 1656, to declare to\r\nthe world that these supposed attendant stars are in fact part of a ring\r\nwhich surrounds, and yet is completely distinct from the body of\r\nSaturn;[59] and the still more accurate observations of Herschel have\r\nascertained that it consists of two concentric rings revolving round the\r\nplanet, and separated from each other by a space which our most powerful\r\ntelescopes scarcely enable us to measure.\r\n\r\nGalileo's second statement concluded with the remark, that \"in the other\r\nplanets nothing new was to be observed;\" but a month had scarcely\r\nelapsed, before he communicated to the world another enigma,\r\n\r\n    _Hæc immatura à me jam frustra leguntur oy_,\r\n\r\nwhich, as he said, contained the announcement of a new phenomenon, in\r\nthe highest degree important to the truth of the Copernican system. The\r\ninterpretation of this is,\r\n\r\n    _Cynthiæ figuras æmulatur mater amorum_,\r\n\r\nthat is to say,—Venus rivals the appearances of the moon—for Venus\r\nbeing now arrived at that part of her orbit in which she is placed\r\nbetween the earth and the sun, and consequently, with only a part of her\r\nenlightened surface turned towards the earth, the telescope shewed her\r\nin a crescent form, like the moon in a similar position, and tracing her\r\nthrough the whole of her orbit round the sun, or at least so long as she\r\nwas not invisible from his overpowering light, Galileo had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the enlightened portion in each position assume\r\nthe form appropriate to that hypothesis. It was with reason, therefore,\r\nthat he laid stress on the importance of this observation, which also\r\nestablished another doctrine scarcely less obnoxious to the\r\nAnti-Copernicans, namely, that a new point of resemblance was here found\r\nbetween the earth and one of the principal planets; and as the\r\nreflection from the earth upon the moon had shewn it to be luminous like\r\nthe planets when subjected to the rays of the sun, so this change of\r\napparent figure demonstrated that one of the planets not near the earth,\r\nand therefore probably all, were in their own nature not luminous, and\r\nonly reflected the sun's light which fell upon them; an inference, of\r\nwhich the probability was still farther increased a few years later by\r\nthe observation of the transit of Mercury over the sun's disc.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that only twenty-five years before this discovery of the\r\nphases (or appearances) of Venus, a commentator of Aristotle, under the\r\nname of Lucillus Philalthæus, had advanced the doctrine that all the\r\nplanets except the moon are luminous of themselves, and in proof of his\r\nassertion had urged, \"that if the other planets and fixed stars received\r\ntheir light from the sun, they would, as they approached and receded\r\nfrom him, or as he approached and receded from them, assume the same\r\nphases as the moon, which, he adds, we have never yet observed.\"—He\r\nfurther remarks, \"that Mercury and Venus would, in the supposed case of\r\ntheir being nearer the earth than the sun, eclipse it occasionally, just\r\nas eclipses are occasioned by the moon.\" Perhaps it is still more\r\nremarkable, that these very passages, in which the reasoning is so\r\ncorrect, though the facts are too hastily taken for granted, (the common\r\nerror of that school,) are quoted by Benedetti, expressly to shew the\r\nignorance and presumption of the author. Copernicus, whose want of\r\ninstruments had prevented him from observing the horned appearance of\r\nVenus when between the earth and sun, had perceived how formidable an\r\nobstacle the non-appearance of this phenomenon presented to his system;\r\nhe endeavoured, though unsatisfactorily, to account for it by supposing\r\nthat the rays of the sun passed freely through the body of the planet,\r\nand Galileo takes occasion to praise him for not being deterred from\r\nadopting the system, which, on the whole, appeared to agree best with\r\nthe phenomena, by meeting with some which it did not enable him to\r\nexplain. Milton, whose poem is filled with allusions to Galileo and his\r\nastronomy, has not suffered this beautiful phenomenon to pass unnoticed.\r\nAfter describing the creation of the Sun, he adds:—\r\n\r\n    Hither, as to their fountain, other stars\r\n    Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,\r\n    And hence the morning planet gilds her horns.[60]\r\n\r\nGalileo also assured himself, at the same time, that the fixed stars did\r\nnot receive their light from the sun. This he ascertained by comparing\r\nthe vividness of their light, in all positions, with the feebleness of\r\nthat of the distant planets, and by observing the different degrees of\r\nbrightness with which all the planets shone at different distances from\r\nthe sun. The more remote planets did not, of course, afford equal\r\nfacilities with Venus for so decisive an observation; but Galileo\r\nthought he observed, that when Mars was in quadratures, (or in the\r\nquarters, the middle points of his path on either side,) his figure\r\nvaried slightly from a perfect circle. Galileo concludes the letter, in\r\nwhich he announces these last observations to his pupil Castelli, with\r\nthe following expressions, shewing how justly he estimated the\r\nopposition they encountered:—\"You almost make me laugh by saying that\r\nthese clear observations are sufficient to convince the most obstinate:\r\nit seems you have yet to learn that long ago the observations were\r\nenough to convince those who are capable of reasoning, and those who\r\nwish to learn the truth; but that to convince the obstinate, and those\r\nwho care for nothing beyond the vain applause of the stupid and\r\nsenseless vulgar, not even the testimony of the stars would suffice,\r\nwere they to descend on earth to speak for themselves. Let us then\r\nendeavour to procure some knowledge for ourselves, and rest contented\r\nwith this sole satisfaction; but of advancing in popular opinion, or\r\ngaining the assent of the book-philosophers, let us abandon both the\r\nhope and the desire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] Adone di Marini, Venetiis, 1623, Cant. x.\r\n\r\n[57] Speculat.

Perhaps not fully appreciating his desire of returning\r\nto his native country, and the importance to him and to the scientific\r\nworld in general, of the complete leisure which Cosmo secured to him at\r\nFlorence, (for by the terms of his diploma he was not even required to\r\nreside at Pisa, nor to give any lectures, except on extraordinary\r\noccasions, to sovereign princes and other strangers of distinction,) the\r\nVenetians remembered only that they had offered him an honourable asylum\r\nwhen almost driven from Pisa; that they had increased his salary to four\r\ntimes the sum which any previous professor had enjoyed; and, finally, by\r\nan almost unprecedented decree, that they had but just secured him in\r\nhis post during the remainder of his life. Many took such offence as to\r\nrefuse to have any further communication with him; and Sagredo, a\r\nconstant friend of Galileo, wrote him word that he had been threatened\r\nwith a similar desertion unless he should concur in the same peremptory\r\nresolution, which threats, however, Sagredo, at the same time, intimates\r\nhis intention of braving.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1611, Galileo made his first appearance in Rome, where\r\nhe was received with marks of distinguished consideration, and where all\r\nranks were eager to share the pleasure of contemplating the new\r\ndiscoveries. \"Whether we consider cardinal, prince, or prelate, he found\r\nan honourable reception from them all, and had their palaces as open and\r\nfree to him as the houses of his private friends.\"[61] Among other\r\ndistinctions he was solicited to become a member of the newly-formed\r\nphilosophical society, the once celebrated _Academia Lincea_, to which\r\nhe readily assented. The founder of this society was Federigo Cesi, the\r\nMarchese di Monticelli, a young Roman nobleman, the devotion of whose\r\ntime and fortune to the interests of science has not been by any means\r\nrewarded with a reputation commensurate with his deserts. If the energy\r\nof his mind had been less worthily employed than in fostering the cause\r\nof science and truth, and in extending the advantages of his birth and\r\nfortune to as many as were willing to co-operate with him, the name of\r\nFederigo Cesi might have appeared more prominently on the page of\r\nhistory. Cesi had scarcely completed his 18th year, when, in 1603, he\r\nformed the plan of a philosophical society, which in the first instance\r\nconsisted only of himself and three of his most intimate friends, Hecke,\r\na Flemish physician, Stelluti, and Anastasio de Filiis. Cesi's father,\r\nthe Duca d'Acquasparta, who was of an arbitrary and extravagant temper,\r\nconsidered such pursuits and associates as derogatory to his son's rank;\r\nhe endeavoured to thwart the design by the most violent and\r\nunjustifiable proceedings, in consequence of which, Cesi in the\r\nbeginning of 1605 privately quitted Rome, Hecke was obliged to leave\r\nItaly altogether from fear of the Inquisition, which was excited against\r\nhim, and the academy was for a time virtually dissolved. The details of\r\nthese transactions are foreign to the present narrative: it will be\r\nenough to mention that, in 1609, Cesi, who had never altogether\r\nabandoned his scheme, found the opposition decaying which he at first\r\nexperienced, and with better success he renewed the plan which he had\r\nsketched six years before. A few extracts from the Regulations will\r\nserve to shew the spirit in which this distinguished society was\r\nconceived:—\r\n\r\n\"The Lyncean Society desires for its academicians, philosophers eager\r\nfor real knowledge, who will give themselves to the study of nature, and\r\nespecially to mathematics; at the same time it will not neglect the\r\nornaments of elegant literature and philology, which like a graceful\r\ngarment adorn the whole body of science.—In the pious love of wisdom,\r\nand to the praise of the most good and most high God, let the Lynceans\r\ngive their minds, first to observation and reflection, and afterwards to\r\nwriting and publishing.—It is not within the Lyncean plan to find\r\nleisure for recitations and declamatory assemblies; the meetings will\r\nneither be frequent nor full, and chiefly for transacting the necessary\r\nbusiness of the society: but those who wish to enjoy such exercises will\r\nin no respect be hindered, provided they attend them as accessory\r\nstudies, decently and quietly, and without making promises and\r\nprofessions of how much they are about to do. For there is ample\r\nphilosophical employment for every one by himself, particularly if pains\r\nare taken in travelling and in the observation of natural phenomena, and\r\nin the book of nature which every one has at home, that is to say, the\r\nheavens and the earth; and enough may be learned from the habits of\r\nconstant correspondence with each other, and alternate offices of\r\ncounsel and assistance.—Let the first fruits of wisdom be love; and so\r\nlet the Lynceans love each other as if united by the strictest ties, nor\r\nsuffer any interruption of this sincere bond of love and faith,\r\nemanating from the source of virtue and philosophy.—Let them add to\r\ntheir names the title of Lyncean, which has been advisedly chosen as a\r\nwarning and constant stimulus, especially when they write on any\r\nliterary subject, also in their private letters to their associates, and\r\nin general when any work comes from them wisely and well performed.—The\r\nLynceans will pass over in silence all political controversies and\r\nquarrels of every kind, and wordy disputes, especially gratuitous ones,\r\nwhich give occasion to deceit, unfriendliness, and hatred; like men who\r\ndesire peace, and seek to preserve their studies free from molestation,\r\nand to avoid every sort of disturbance. And if any one by command of his\r\nsuperiors, or from some other necessity, is reduced to handle such\r\nmatters, since they are foreign to physical and mathematical science,\r\nand consequently alien to the object of the Academy, let them be printed\r\nwithout the Lyncean name.\"[62]\r\n\r\nThe society which was eventually organized formed but a very trifling\r\npart of the comprehensive scheme which Cesi originally proposed to\r\nhimself; it had been his wish to establish a scientific Order which\r\nshould have corresponding lodges in the principal towns of Europe, and\r\nin other parts of the globe, each consisting of not more than five nor\r\nless than three members, besides an unlimited number of Academicians not\r\nrestricted to any particular residence or regulations. The\r\nmortifications and difficulties to which he was subjected from his\r\nfather's unprincipled behaviour, render it most extraordinary and\r\nadmirable that he should have ventured to undertake even so much as he\r\nactually carried into execution. He promised to furnish to the members\r\nof his society such assistance as they might require in the prosecution\r\nof their respective researches, and also to defray the charges of\r\npublishing such of their works as should be thought worthy of appearing\r\nwith the common sanction. Such liberal offers were not likely to meet\r\nwith an unfavourable reception: they were thankfully accepted by many\r\nwell qualified to carry his design into execution, and Cesi was soon\r\nenabled formally to open his academy, the distinctive title of which he\r\nborrowed from the Lynx, with reference to the piercing sight which that\r\nanimal has been supposed to possess. This quality seemed to him an\r\nappropriate emblem of those which he desired to find in his\r\nacademicians, for the purpose of investigating the secrets of nature;\r\nand although, at the present day, the name may appear to border on the\r\ngrotesque, it was conceived in the spirit of the age, and the fantastic\r\nnames of the numberless societies which were rapidly formed in various\r\nparts of Italy far exceed whatever degree of quaintness may be thought\r\nto belong to the Lyncean name. The Inflamed—the Transformed—the\r\nUneasy—the Humorists—the Fantastic—the Intricate—the Indolent—the\r\nSenseless—the Undeceived—the Valiant—the Ætherial Societies are\r\nselected from a vast number of similar institutions, the names of which,\r\nnow almost their sole remains, are collected by the industry of Morhof\r\nand Tiraboschi.[63] The Humorists are named by Morhof as the only\r\nItalian philosophical society anterior to the Lynceans; their founder\r\nwas Paolo Mancino, and the distinctive symbol which they adopted was\r\nrain dropping from a cloud, with the motto _Redit agmine dulci_;—their\r\ntitle is derived from the same metaphor. The object of their union\r\nappears to have been similar to that of the Lynceans, but they at no\r\ntime attained to the celebrity to which Cesi's society rose from the\r\nmoment of its incorporation. Cesi took the presidency for his life, and\r\nthe celebrated Baptista Porta was appointed vice president at Naples.\r\nStelluti acted as the legal representative of the society, with the\r\ntitle of procuratore. Of the other two original members Anastasio de\r\nFiliis was dead, and although Hecke returned to Italy in 1614, and\r\nrejoined the Academy, yet he was soon afterwards struck off the list in\r\nconsequence of his lapsing into insanity. Among the academicians we find\r\nthe names of Galileo, Fabio Colonna, Lucas Valerio, Guiducci, Welser,\r\nGiovanni Fabro, Terrentio, Virginio Cesarini, Ciampoli, Molitor,\r\nCardinal Barberino, (nephew of Pope Urban VIII.) Stelliola, Salviati,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe principal monument still remaining of the zeal and industry to which\r\nCesi incited his academicians is the Phytobasanos, a compendium of the\r\nnatural history of Mexico, which must be considered a surprising\r\nperformance for the times in which it appeared. It was written by a\r\nSpaniard named Hernandez; and Reccho, who often has the credit of the\r\nwhole work, made great additions to it. During fifty years the\r\nmanuscript had been neglected, when Cesi discovered it, and employed\r\nTerrentio, Fabro, and Colonna, all Lynceans, to publish it enriched with\r\ntheir notes and emendations. Cesi himself published several treatises,\r\ntwo of which are extant; his _Tabulæ Phytosophicæ_, and a Dissertation\r\non Bees entitled _Apiarium_, the only known copy of which last is in the\r\nlibrary of the Vatican. His great work, _Theatrum Naturæ_, was never\r\nprinted; a circumstance which tends to shew that he did not assemble the\r\nsociety round him for the purpose of ministering to his own vanity, but\r\npostponed the publication of his own productions to the labours of his\r\ncoadjutors. This, and many other valuable works belonging to the academy\r\nexisted in manuscript till lately in the Albani Library at Rome. Cesi\r\ncollected, not a large, but an useful library for the use of the\r\nacademy, (which was afterwards augmented on the premature death of\r\nCesarini by the donation of his books); he filled a botanical garden\r\nwith the rarer specimens of plants, and arranged a museum of natural\r\ncuriosities; his palace at Rome was constantly open to the academicians;\r\nhis purse and his influence were employed with equal liberality in their\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nCesi's death, in 1632, put a sudden stop to the prosperity of the\r\nsociety, a consequence which may be attributed to the munificence with\r\nwhich he had from the first sustained it: no one could be found to fill\r\nhis place in the princely manner to which the academicians were\r\naccustomed, and the society, after lingering some years under the\r\nnominal patronage of Urban VIII., gradually decayed, till, by the death\r\nof its principal members, and dispersion of the rest, it became entirely\r\nextinct.[64] Bianchi, whose sketch of the academy was almost the only\r\none till the appearance of Odescalchi's history, made an attempt to\r\nrevive it in the succeeding century, but without any permanent effect. A\r\nsociety under the same name has been formed since 1784, and is still\r\nflourishing in Rome. Before leaving the subject it may be mentioned,\r\nthat one of the earliest notices that Bacon's works were known in Italy\r\nis to be found in a letter to Cesi, dated 1625; in which Pozzo, who had\r\ngone to Paris with Cardinal Barberino, mentions having seen them there\r\nwith great admiration, and suggests that Bacon would be a fit person to\r\nbe proposed as a member of their society. After Galileo's death, three\r\nof his principal followers, Viviani, Torricelli, and Aggiunti formed the\r\nplan of establishing a similar philosophical society, and though\r\nAggiunti and Torricelli died before the scheme could be realized,\r\nViviani pressed it forward, and, under the auspices of Ferdinand II.,\r\nformed a society, which, in 1657, merged in the famous _Academia del\r\nCimento_, or Experimental Academy. This latter held its occasional\r\nmeetings at the palace of Ferdinand's brother, Leopold de' Medici: it\r\nwas composed chiefly, if not entirely, of Galileo's pupils and friends.\r\nDuring the few years that this society lasted, one of the principal\r\nobjects of which was declared to be the repetition and developement of\r\nGalileo's experiments, it kept up a correspondence with the principal\r\nphilosophers in every part of Europe, but when Leopold was, in 1666,\r\ncreated a cardinal, it appears to have been dissolved, scarcely ten\r\nyears after its institution.[65] This digression may be excused in\r\nfavour of so interesting an establishment as the Academia Lincea, which\r\npreceded by half a century the formation of the Royal Society of London,\r\nand Académie Françoise of Paris.\r\n\r\nThese latter two are mentioned together, probably for the first time, by\r\nSalusbury. The passage is curious in an historical point of view, and\r\nworth extracting:—\"In imitation of these societies, Paris and London\r\nhave erected theirs of _Les Beaux Esprits_, and of the _Virtuosi_: the\r\none by the countenance of the most eminent Cardinal Richelieu, the other\r\nby the royal encouragement of his sacred Majesty that now is. The _Beaux\r\nEsprits_ have published sundry volumes of their moral and physiological\r\nconferences, with the laws and history of their fellowship; and I hope\r\nthe like in due time from our Royal Society; that so such as envie their\r\nfame and felicity, and such as suspect their ability and candor, may be\r\nsilenced and disappointed in their detractions and expectations.\"[66]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] Salusbury, Math. Coll.\r\n\r\n[62] Perhaps it was to deprecate the hostility of the Jesuits that, at\r\nthe close of these Regulations, the Lynceans are directed to address\r\ntheir prayers, among other Saints, especially to Ignatius Loyola, as to\r\none who greatly favoured the interests of learning.

This was the discovery, which he first made\r\nin the month of March, 1611, of dark spots on the body of the sun. A\r\ncurious fact, and one which well serves to illustrate Galileo's\r\nsuperiority in seeing things simply as they are, is, that these spots\r\nhad been observed and recorded centuries before he existed, but, for\r\nwant of careful observation, their true nature had been constantly\r\nmisapprehended. One of the most celebrated occasions was in the year 807\r\nof our era, in which a dark spot is mentioned as visible on the face of\r\nthe sun during seven or eight days. It was then supposed to be\r\nMercury.[67] Kepler, whose astronomical knowledge would not suffer him\r\nto overlook that it was impossible that Mercury could remain so long in\r\nconjunction with the sun, preferred to solve the difficulty by supposing\r\nthat, in Aimoin's original account, the expression was not _octo dies_\r\n(eight days), but _octoties_—a barbarous word, which he supposed to\r\nhave been written for _octies_ (eight times); and that the other\r\naccounts (in which the number of days mentioned is different) copying\r\nloosely from the first, had both mistaken the word, and misquoted the\r\ntime which they thought they found mentioned there. It is impossible to\r\nlook on this explanation as satisfactory, but Kepler, who at that time\r\ndid not dream of spots on the sun, was perfectly contented with it. In\r\n1609, he himself observed upon the sun a black spot, which he in like\r\nmanner mistook for Mercury, and unluckily the day, being cloudy, did\r\nnot allow him to contemplate it sufficiently long to discover his\r\nerror, which the slowness of its apparent motion would soon have pointed\r\nout.[68] He hastened to publish his supposed observation, but no sooner\r\nwas Galileo's discovery of the solar spots announced, than he, with that\r\ncandour which as much as his flighty disposition certainly characterized\r\nhim at all times, retracted his former opinion, and owned his belief\r\nthat he had been mistaken. In fact it is known from the more accurate\r\ntheory which we now possess of Mercury's motions, that it did not pass\r\nover the sun's face at the time when Kepler thought he perceived it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nGalileo's observations were in their consequences to him particularly\r\nunfortunate, as in the course of the controversy in which they engaged\r\nhim, he first became personally embroiled with the powerful party, whose\r\nprevailing influence was one of the chief causes of his subsequent\r\nmisfortunes. Before we enter upon that discussion, it will be proper to\r\nmention another famous treatise which Galileo produced soon after his\r\nreturn from Rome to Florence, in 1612. This is, his Discourse on\r\nFloating Bodies, which restored Archimedes' theory of hydrostatics, and\r\nhas, of course, met with the opposition which few of Galileo's works\r\nfailed to encounter. In the commencement, he thought it necessary to\r\napologize for writing on a subject so different from that which chiefly\r\noccupied the public attention, and declared that he had been too closely\r\noccupied in calculating the periods of the revolutions of Jupiter's\r\nsatellites to permit him to publish anything earlier. These periods he\r\nhad succeeded in determining during the preceding year, whilst at Rome,\r\nand he now announced them to complete their circuits, the first in about\r\n1 day, 18½ hours; the second in 3 days, 13 hours, 20 minutes; the third\r\nin 7 days, 4 hours; and the outermost in 16 days, 18 hours. All these\r\nnumbers he gave merely as approximately true, and promised to continue\r\nhis observations, for the purpose of correcting the results. He then\r\nadds an announcement of his recent discovery of the solar spots, \"which,\r\nas they change their situation, offer a strong argument, either that the\r\nsun revolves on itself, or that, perhaps, other stars, like Venus and\r\nMercury, revolve about it, invisible at all other times, on account of\r\nthe small distance to which they are removed from him.\" To this he\r\nafterwards subjoined, that, by continued observation, he had satisfied\r\nhimself that these solar spots were in actual contact with the surface\r\nof the sun, where they are continually appearing and disappearing; that\r\ntheir figures were very irregular, some being very dark, and others not\r\nso black; that one would often divide into three or four, and, at other\r\ntimes, two, three, or more would unite into one; besides which, that\r\nthey had all a common and regular motion, with which they revolved round\r\nwith the sun, which turned upon its axis in about the time of a lunar\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nHaving by these prefatory observations assuaged the public thirst for\r\nastronomical novelties, he ventures to introduce the principal subject\r\nof the treatise above mentioned. The question of floating bridges had\r\nbeen discussed at one of the scientific parties, assembled at the house\r\nof Galileo's friend Salviati, and the general opinion of the company\r\nappearing to be that the floating or sinking of a body depended\r\nprincipally upon its shape, Galileo undertook to convince them of their\r\nerror. If he had not preferred more direct arguments, he might merely\r\nhave told them that in this instance they were opposed to their\r\nfavourite Aristotle, whose words are very unequivocal on the point in\r\ndispute. \"Form is not the cause why a body moves downwards rather than\r\nupwards, but it does affect the swiftness with which it moves;\"[69]\r\nwhich is exactly the distinction which those who called themselves\r\nAristotelians were unable to perceive, and to which the opinions of\r\nAristotle himself were not always true. Galileo states the discussion to\r\nhave immediately arisen from the assertion of some one in the company,\r\nthat condensation is the effect of cold, and ice was mentioned as an\r\ninstance. On this, Galileo observed, that ice is rather water rarefied\r\nthan condensed, the proof of which is, that ice always floats upon\r\nwater.[70] It was replied, that the reason of this phenomenon was, not\r\nthe superior lightness of the ice, but its incapacity, owing to its flat\r\nshape, to penetrate and overcome the resistance of the water. Galileo\r\ndenied this, and asserted that ice of any shape would float upon water,\r\nand that, if a flat piece of ice were forcibly taken to the bottom, it\r\nwould of itself rise again to the surface. Upon this assertion it\r\nappears that the conversation became so clamorous, that Galileo thought\r\nit pertinent to commence his Essay with the following observation on the\r\nadvantage of delivering scientific opinions in writing, \"because in\r\nconversational arguments, either one or other party, or perhaps both,\r\nare apt to get overwarm, and to speak overloud, and either do not suffer\r\neach other to be heard, or else, transported with the obstinacy of not\r\nyielding, wander far away from the original proposition, and confound\r\nboth themselves and their auditors with the novelty and variety of their\r\nassertions.\" After this gentle rebuke he proceeds with his argument, in\r\nwhich he takes occasion to state the famous hydrostatical paradox, of\r\nwhich the earliest notice is to be found in Stevin's works, a\r\ncontemporary Flemish engineer, and refers it to a principle on which we\r\nshall enlarge in another chapter. He then explains the true theory of\r\nbuoyancy, and refutes the false reasoning on which the contrary opinions\r\nwere founded, with a variety of experiments.\r\n\r\nThe whole value and interest of experimental processes generally depends\r\non a variety of minute circumstances, the detail of which would be\r\nparticularly unsuited to a sketch like the present one. For those who\r\nare desirous of becoming more familiar with Galileo's mode of conducting\r\nan argument, it is fortunate that such a series of experiments exists as\r\nthat contained in this essay; experiments which, from their simplicity,\r\nadmit of being for the most part concisely enumerated, and at the same\r\ntime possess so much intrinsic beauty and characteristic power of\r\nforcing conviction. They also present an admirable specimen of the\r\ntalent for which Galileo was so deservedly famous, of inventing\r\ningenious arguments in favour of his adversaries' absurd opinions before\r\nhe condescended to crush them, shewing that nothing but his love of\r\ntruth stood in the way of his being a more subtle sophist than any\r\namongst them. In addition to these reasons for giving these experiments\r\nsomewhat in detail, is the fact that all explanation of one of the\r\nprincipal phenomena to which they allude is omitted in many more modern\r\ntreatises on Hydrostatics; and in some it is referred precisely to the\r\nfalse doctrines here confuted.\r\n\r\nThe marrow of the dispute is included in Galileo's assertion, that \"The\r\ndiversity of figure given to any solid cannot be in any way the cause of\r\nits absolutely sinking or floating; so that if a solid, when formed for\r\nexample into a spherical figure, sinks or floats in the water, the same\r\nbody will sink or float in the same water, when put into any other form.\r\nThe breadth of the figure may indeed retard its velocity, as well of\r\nascent as descent, and more and more according as the said figure is\r\nreduced to a greater breadth and thinness; but that it may be reduced to\r\nsuch a form as absolutely to put an end to its motion in the same fluid,\r\nI hold to be impossible. In this I have met with great contradictors\r\nwho, producing some experiments, and in particular a thin board of\r\nebony, and a ball of the same wood, and shewing that the ball in water\r\nsinks to the bottom[71], and that the board if put lightly on the\r\nsurface floats, have held and confirmed themselves in their opinion with\r\nthe authority of Aristotle, that the cause of that rest is the breadth\r\nof the figure, unable by its small weight to pierce and penetrate the\r\nresistance of the water's thickness, which is readily overcome by the\r\nother spherical figure.\"—For the purpose of these experiments, Galileo\r\nrecommends a substance such as wax, which may be easily moulded into any\r\nshape, and with which, by the addition of a few filings of lead, a\r\nsubstance may be readily made of any required specific gravity. He then\r\ndeclares that if a ball of wax of the size of an orange, or bigger, be\r\nmade in this manner heavy enough to sink to the bottom, but so lightly\r\nthat if we take from it only one grain of lead it returns to the top;\r\nand if the same wax be afterwards moulded into a broad and thin cake, or\r\ninto any other figure, regular or irregular, the addition of the same\r\ngrain of lead will always make it sink, and it will again rise when we\r\nremove the lead from it.—\"But methinks I hear some of the adversaries\r\nraise a doubt upon my produced experiment: and, first, they offer to my\r\nconsideration that the figure, as a figure simply, and disjunct from the\r\nmatter, works no effect, but requires to be conjoined with the matter;\r\nand, moreover, not with every matter, but with those only wherewith it\r\nmay be able to execute the desired operation. Just as we see by\r\nexperience that an acute and sharp angle is more apt to cut than an\r\nobtuse; yet always provided that both one and the other are joined with\r\na matter fit to cut, as for instance, steel. Therefore a knife with a\r\nfine and sharp edge cuts bread or wood with much ease, which it will not\r\ndo if the edge be blunt and thick; but if, instead of steel, any one\r\nwill take wax and mould it into a knife, undoubtedly he will never learn\r\nthe effects of sharp and blunt edges, because neither of them will cut;\r\nthe wax being unable, by reason of its flexibility, to overcome the\r\nhardness of the wood and bread. And therefore, applying the like\r\ndiscourse to our argument, they say that the difference of figure will\r\nshew different effects with regard to floating and sinking, but not\r\nconjoined with any kind of matter, but only with those matters which by\r\ntheir weight are able to overcome the viscosity of the water (like the\r\nebony which they have selected); and he that will select cork or other\r\nlight wood to form solids of different figures, would in vain seek to\r\nfind out what operation figure has in sinking or floating, because all\r\nwould swim, and that not through any property of this or that figure,\r\nbut through the debility of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"When I begin to examine one by one all the particulars here produced, I\r\nallow not only that figures, simply as such, do not operate in natural\r\nthings, but also that they are never separated from the corporeal\r\nsubstance, nor have I ever alleged them to be stript of sensible matter:\r\nand also I freely admit, that in our endeavours to examine the diversity\r\nof accidents which depend upon the variety of figures, it is necessary\r\nto apply them to matters which obstruct not the various operations of\r\nthose various figures. I admit and grant that I should do very ill if I\r\nwere to try the influence of a sharp edge with a knife of wax, applying\r\nit to cut an oak, because no sharpness in wax is able to cut that very\r\nhard wood. But yet, such an experiment of this knife would not be beside\r\nthe purpose to cut curded milk, or other very yielding matter; nay, in\r\nsuch matters, the wax is more convenient than steel for finding the\r\ndifference depending on the acuteness of the angles, because milk is cut\r\nindifferently with a razor, or a blunt knife. We must therefore have\r\nregard not only to the hardness, solidity, or weight of the bodies\r\nwhich, under different figures, are to divide some matters asunder; but\r\nalso, on the other hand, to the resistance of the matter to be\r\npenetrated. And, since I have chosen a matter which does penetrate the\r\nresistance of the water, and in all figures descends to the bottom, my\r\nantagonists can charge me with no defect; nor (to revert to their\r\nillustration) have I attempted to test the efficacy of acuteness by\r\ncutting with matters unable to cut. I subjoin withal, that all caution,\r\ndistinction, and election of matter would be superfluous and\r\nunnecessary, if the body to be cut should not at all resist the cutting:\r\nif the knife were to be used in cutting a mist, or smoke, one of paper\r\nwould serve the purpose as well as one of Damascus steel; and I assert\r\nthat this is the case with water, and that there is not any solid of\r\nsuch lightness or of such a figure, that being put on the water it will\r\nnot divide and penetrate its thickness; and if you will examine more\r\ncarefully your thin boards of wood, you will see that they have part of\r\ntheir thickness under water; and, moreover, you will see that the\r\nshavings of ebony, stone, or metal, when they float, have not only thus\r\nbroken the continuity of the water, but are with all their thickness\r\nunder the surface of it; and that more and more, according as the\r\nfloating substance is heavier, so that a thin floating plate of lead\r\nwill be lower than the surface of the surrounding water by at least\r\ntwelve times the thickness of the plate, and gold will dive below the\r\nlevel of the water almost twenty times the thickness of the plate, as I\r\nshall shew presently.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate more clearly the non-resistance of water to\r\npenetration, Galileo then directs a cone to be made of wood or wax, and\r\nasserts that when it floats, either with its base or point in the water,\r\nthe solid content of the part immersed will be the same, although the\r\npoint is, by its shape, better adapted to overcome the resistance of the\r\nwater to division, if that were the cause of the buoyancy. Or the\r\nexperiment may be varied by tempering the wax with filings of lead, till\r\nit sinks in the water, when it will be found that in any figure the same\r\ncork must be added to it to raise it to the surface.—\"This silences not\r\nmy antagonists; but they say that all the discourse hitherto made by me\r\nimports little to them, and that it serves their turn, that they have\r\ndemonstrated in one instance, and in such manner and figure as pleases\r\nthem best, namely, in a board and a ball of ebony, that one, when put\r\ninto the water, sinks to the bottom, and that the other stays to swim at\r\nthe top; and the matter being the same, and the two bodies differing in\r\nnothing but in figure, they affirm that with all perspicuity they have\r\ndemonstrated and sensibly manifested what they undertook. Nevertheless I\r\nbelieve, and think I can prove that this very experiment proves nothing\r\nagainst my theory. And first it is false that the ball sinks, and the\r\nboard not; for the board will sink too, if you do to both the figures as\r\nthe words of our question require; that is, if you put them both _in_\r\nthe water; for to be in the water implies to be placed in the water, and\r\nby Aristotle's own definition of place, to be placed imports to be\r\nenvironed by the surface of the ambient body; but when my antagonists\r\nshew the floating board of ebony, they put it not into the water, but\r\nupon the water; where, being detained by a certain impediment (of which\r\nmore anon) it is surrounded, partly with water, partly with air, which\r\nis contrary to our agreement, for that was that the bodies should be in\r\nthe water, and not part in the water, part in the air. I will not omit\r\nanother reason, founded also upon experience, and, if I deceive not\r\nmyself, conclusive against the notion that figure, and the resistance of\r\nthe water to penetration have anything to do with the buoyancy of\r\nbodies. Choose a piece of wood or other matter, as for instance\r\nwalnut-wood, of which a ball rises from the bottom of the water to the\r\nsurface more slowly than a ball of ebony of the same size sinks, so that\r\nclearly the ball of ebony divides the water more readily in sinking than\r\ndoes the walnut in rising. Then take a board of walnut-tree equal to and\r\nlike the floating ebony one of my antagonists; and if it be true that\r\nthis latter floats by reason of the figure being unable to penetrate the\r\nwater, the other of walnut-tree, without all question, if thrust to the\r\nbottom ought to stay there, as having the same impeding figure, and\r\nbeing less apt to overcome the said resistance of the water. But if we\r\nfind by experience that not only the thin board, but every other figure\r\nof the same walnut-tree will return to float, as unquestionably we\r\nshall, then I must desire my opponents to forbear to attribute the\r\nfloating of the ebony to the figure of the board, since the resistance\r\nof the water is the same in rising as in sinking, and the force of\r\nascension of the walnut-tree is less than the ebony's force for going to\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Now, let us return to the thin plate of gold or silver, or the thin\r\nboard of ebony, and let us lay it lightly upon the water, so that it may\r\nstay there without sinking, and carefully observe the effect. It will\r\nappear clearly that the plates are a considerable matter lower than the\r\nsurface of the water which rises up, and makes a kind of rampart round\r\nthem on every side, in the manner shewn in the annexed figure, in which\r\nBDLF represents the surface of the water, and AEIO the surface of the\r\nplate. But if it have already penetrated and overcome the continuity of\r\nthe water, and is of its own nature heavier than the water, why does it\r\nnot continue to sink, but stop and suspend itself in that little dimple\r\nthat its weight has made in the water? My answer is, because in sinking\r\ntill its surface is below the water which rises up in a bank round it,\r\nit draws after and carries along with it the air above it, so that that\r\nwhich in this case descends and is placed in the water, is not only the\r\nboard of ebony or plate of iron, but a compound of ebony and air, from\r\nwhich composition results a solid no longer specifically heavier than\r\nthe water, as was the ebony or gold alone. But, Gentlemen, we want the\r\nsame matter; you are to alter nothing but the shape, and therefore have\r\nthe goodness to remove this air, which may be done simply by washing the\r\nupper surface of the board, for the water having once got between the\r\nboard and air will run together, and the ebony will go to the bottom;\r\nand if it does not, you have won the day. But methinks I hear some of my\r\nantagonists cunningly opposing this, and telling me that they will not\r\non any account allow their board to be wetted, because the weight of the\r\nwater so added, by making it heavier than it was before, draws it to the\r\nbottom, and that the addition of new weight is contrary to our\r\nagreement, which was that the matter should be the same.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"To this I answer first, that nobody can suppose bodies to be put into\r\nthe water without their being wet, nor do I wish to do more to the\r\nboard than you may do to the ball. Moreover, it is not true that the\r\nboard sinks on account of the weight of the water added in the washing;\r\nfor I will put ten or twenty drops on the floating board, and so long as\r\nthey stand separate it shall not sink; but if the board be taken out,\r\nand all that water wiped off, and the whole surface bathed with one\r\nsingle drop, and put it again upon the water, there is no question but\r\nit will sink, the other water running to cover it, being no longer\r\nhindered by the air. In the next place it is altogether false that water\r\ncan in any way increase the weight of bodies immersed in it, for water\r\nhas no weight in water, since it does not sink. Now, just as he who\r\nshould say that brass by its own nature sinks, but that when formed into\r\nthe shape of a kettle, it acquires from that figure a virtue of lying in\r\nthe water without sinking, would say what is false, because that is not\r\npurely brass which then is put into the water, but a compound of brass\r\nand air; so is it neither more nor less false, that a thin plate of\r\nbrass or ebony swims by virtue of its dilated and broad figure. Also I\r\ncannot omit to tell my opponents, that this conceit of refusing to bathe\r\nthe surface of the board, might beget an opinion in a third person of a\r\npoverty of arguments on their side, especially as the conversation began\r\nabout flakes of ice, in which it would be simple to require that the\r\nsurfaces should be kept dry; not to mention that such pieces of ice,\r\nwhether wet or dry, always float, and as my antagonists say, because of\r\ntheir shape.\r\n\r\n\"Some may wonder that I affirm this power to be in the air of keeping\r\nthe plate of brass or silver above water, as if in a certain sense I\r\nwould attribute to the air a kind of magnetic virtue for sustaining\r\nheavy bodies with which it is in contact. To satisfy all these doubts, I\r\nhave contrived the following experiment to demonstrate how truly the air\r\ndoes support these solids; for I have found, when one of these bodies\r\nwhich floats when placed lightly on the water, is thoroughly bathed and\r\nsunk to the bottom, that by carrying down to it a little air without\r\notherwise touching it in the least, I am able to raise and carry it back\r\nto the top, where it floats as before. To this effect I take a ball of\r\nwax, and with a little lead make it just heavy enough to sink very\r\nslowly to the bottom, taking care that its surface be quite smooth and\r\neven. This, if put gently into the water, submerges almost entirely,\r\nthere remaining visible only a little of the very top, which, so long as\r\nit is joined to the air, keeps the ball afloat; but if we take away the\r\ncontact of the air by wetting this top, the ball sinks to the bottom,\r\nand remains there. Now to make it return to the surface by virtue of the\r\nair which before sustained it, thrust into the water a glass, with the\r\nmouth downwards, which will carry with it the air it contains; and move\r\nthis down towards the ball, until you see by the transparency of the\r\nglass that the air has reached the top of it; then gently draw the glass\r\nupwards, and you will see the ball rise, and afterwards stay on the top\r\nof the water, if you carefully part the glass and water without too much\r\ndisturbing it.[72] There is therefore a certain affinity between the air\r\nand other bodies, which holds them united, so that they separate not\r\nwithout a kind of violence, just as between water and other bodies; for\r\nin drawing them wholly out of the water, we see the water follow them,\r\nand rise sensibly above the level before it quits them.\" Having\r\nestablished this principle by this exceedingly ingenious and convincing\r\nexperiment, Galileo proceeds to shew from it what must be the dimensions\r\nof a plate of any substance which will float as the wax does, assuming\r\nin each case that we know the greatest height at which the rampart of\r\nwater will stand round it. In like manner he shows that a pyramidal or\r\nconical figure may be made of any substance, such that by help of the\r\nair, it shall rest upon the water without wetting more than its base;\r\nand that we may so form a cone of any substance that it shall float if\r\nplaced gently on the surface, with its point downwards, whereas no care\r\nor pains will enable it to float with its base downwards, owing to the\r\ndifferent proportions of air which in the two positions remain connected\r\nwith it. With this parting blow at his antagonist's theory we close our\r\nextracts from this admirable essay.\r\n\r\nThe first elements of the theory of running waters were reserved for\r\nCastelli, an intimate friend and pupil of Galileo. On the present\r\noccasion, Castelli appeared as the ostensible author of a defence\r\nagainst the attacks made by Vincenzio di Grazia and by Lodovico delle\r\nColumbe (the author of the crystalline composition of the moon) on the\r\nobnoxious theory. After destroying all the objections which they\r\nproduced, the writer tauntingly bids them remember, that he was merely\r\nGalileo's pupil, and consider how much more effectually Galileo himself\r\nwould have confuted them, had he thought it worth while. It was not\r\nknown till several years after his death, that this Essay was in fact\r\nwritten by Galileo himself.[73]\r\n\r\nThese compositions merely occupied the leisure time which he could\r\nwithhold from the controversy on the solar spots to which we have\r\nalready alluded. A German Jesuit named Christopher Scheiner, who was\r\nprofessor of mathematics at Ingolstadt, in imitation of Galileo had\r\ncommenced a series of observations on them, but adopted the theory\r\nwhich, as we have seen, Galileo had examined and rejected, that these\r\nspots are planets circulating at some distance from the body of the sun.\r\nThe same opinion had been taken up by a French astronomer, who in honour\r\nof the reigning family called them Borbonian stars. Scheiner promulgated\r\nhis notions in three letters, addressed to their common friend Welser,\r\nunder the quaint signature of \"_Apelles latens post tabulam_.\" Galileo\r\nreplied to Scheiner's letters by three others, also addressed to Welser,\r\nand although the dispute was carried on amid mutual professions of\r\nrespect and esteem, it laid the foundation of the total estrangement\r\nwhich afterwards took place between the two authors. Galileo's part of\r\nthis controversy was published at Rome by the Lyncean Academy in 1613.\r\nTo the last of his letters, written in December, 1612, is annexed a\r\ntable of the expected positions of Jupiter's satellites during the\r\nmonths of March and April of the following year, which, imperfect as it\r\nnecessarily was, cannot be looked upon without the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter it is mentioned that Saturn presented a novel\r\nappearance, which, for an instant, almost induced Galileo to mistrust\r\nthe accuracy of his earlier observations. The lateral appendages of this\r\nplanet had disappeared, and the accompanying extract will show the\r\nuneasiness which Galileo could not conceal at the sight of this\r\nphenomenon, although it is admirable to see the contempt with which,\r\neven in that trying moment, he expresses his consciousness that his\r\nadversaries were unworthy of the triumph they appeared on the point of\r\ncelebrating.—\"Looking on Saturn within these few days, I found it\r\nsolitary, without the assistance of its accustomed stars, and in short,\r\nperfectly round and defined like Jupiter, and such it still remains. Now\r\nwhat can be said of so strange a metamorphosis? are perhaps the two\r\nsmaller stars consumed, like the spots on the sun? have they suddenly\r\nvanished and fled? or has Saturn devoured his own children? or was the\r\nappearance indeed fraud and illusion, with which the glasses have for so\r\nlong a time mocked me, and so many others who have often observed with\r\nme. Now perhaps the time is come to revive the withering hopes of those,\r\nwho, guided by more profound contemplations, have fathomed all the\r\nfallacies of the new observations and recognised their impossibility! I\r\ncannot resolve what to say in a chance so strange, so new, and so\r\nunexpected; the shortness of the time, the unexampled occurrence, the\r\nweakness of my intellect, and the terror of being mistaken, have greatly\r\nconfounded me.\" These first expressions of alarm are not to be wondered\r\nat; however, he soon recovered courage, and ventured to foretel the\r\nperiods at which the lateral stars would again show themselves,\r\nprotesting at the same time, that he was in no respect to be understood\r\nas classing this prediction among the results which depend on certain\r\nprinciples and sound conclusions, but merely on some conjectures which\r\nappeared to him probable. From one of the Dialogues on the System, we\r\nlearn that this conjecture was, that Saturn might revolve upon his axis,\r\nbut the period which he assumed is very different from the true one, as\r\nmight be expected from its being intended to account for a phenomenon of\r\nwhich Galileo had not rightly apprehended the character.\r\n\r\nHe closed this letter with renewed professions of courtesy and\r\nfriendship towards Apelles, enjoining Welser not to communicate it\r\nwithout adding his excuses, if he should be thought to dissent too\r\nviolently from his antagonist's ideas, declaring that his only object\r\nwas the discovery of truth, and that he had freely exposed his own\r\nopinion, which he was still ready to change, so soon as his errors\r\nshould be made manifest to him; and that he would consider himself\r\nunder special obligation to any one who would be kind enough to discover\r\nand correct them. These letters were written from the villa of his\r\nfriend Salviati at Selve near Florence, where he passed great part of\r\nhis time, particularly during his frequent indispositions, conceiving\r\nthat the air of Florence was prejudicial to him. Cesi was very anxious\r\nfor their appearance, since they were (in his own words) so hard a\r\nmorsel for the teeth of the Peripatetics, and he exhorted Galileo, in\r\nthe name of the society, \"to continue to give them, and the nameless\r\nJesuit, something to gnaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67] Aimoini Hist.

All the\r\nprofessors of the old opinions, who suddenly found the knowledge on\r\nwhich their reputation was founded struck from under them, and who could\r\nnot reconcile themselves to their new situation of learners, were united\r\nagainst him; and to this powerful cabal was now added the still greater\r\ninfluence of the jesuits and pseudo-theological party, who fancied they\r\nsaw in the spirit of Galileo's writings the same inquisitive temper\r\nwhich they had already found so inconvenient in Luther and his\r\nadherents. The alarm became greater every day, inasmuch as Galileo had\r\nsucceeded in training round him a numerous band of followers who all\r\nappeared imbued with the same dangerous spirit of innovation, and his\r\nfavourite scholars were successful candidates for professorships in many\r\nof the most celebrated universities of Italy.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1613, Galileo addressed a letter to his pupil, the Abbé\r\nCastelli, in which he endeavoured to shew that there is as much\r\ndifficulty in reconciling the Ptolemaic as the Copernican system of the\r\nworld with the astronomical expressions contained in the Scriptures, and\r\nasserted, that the object of the Scriptures not being to teach\r\nastronomy, such expressions are there used as would be intelligible and\r\nconformable to the vulgar belief, without regard to the true structure\r\nof the universe; which argument he afterwards amplified in a letter\r\naddressed to Christina, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, the mother of his\r\npatron Cosmo. He discourses on this subject with the moderation and good\r\nsense which so peculiarly characterized him. \"I am,\" says he, \"inclined\r\nto believe, that the intention of the sacred Scriptures is to give to\r\nmankind the information necessary for their salvation, and which,\r\nsurpassing all human knowledge, can by no other means be accredited than\r\nby the mouth of the Holy Spirit. But I do not hold it necessary to\r\nbelieve, that the same God who has endowed us with senses, with speech,\r\nand intellect, intended that we should neglect the use of these, and\r\nseek by other means for knowledge which they are sufficient to procure\r\nus; especially in a science like astronomy, of which so little notice is\r\ntaken in the Scriptures, that none of the planets, except the sun and\r\nmoon, and, once or twice only, Venus under the name of Lucifer, are so\r\nmuch as named there. This therefore being granted, methinks that in the\r\ndiscussion of natural problems we ought not to begin at the authority of\r\ntexts of Scripture, but at sensible experiments and necessary\r\ndemonstrations: for, from the divine word, the sacred Scripture and\r\nnature did both alike proceed, and I conceive that, concerning natural\r\neffects, that which either sensible experience sets before our eyes, or\r\nnecessary demonstrations do prove unto us, ought not upon any account to\r\nbe called into question, much less condemned, upon the testimony of\r\nScriptural texts, which may under their words couch senses seemingly\r\ncontrary thereto.\r\n\r\n\"Again, to command the very professors of astronomy that they of\r\nthemselves see to the confuting of their own observations and\r\ndemonstrations, is to enjoin a thing beyond all possibility of doing;\r\nfor it is not only to command them not to see that which they do see,\r\nand not to understand that which they do understand, but it is to order\r\nthem to seek for and to find the contrary of that which they happen to\r\nmeet with. I would entreat these wise and prudent fathers, that they\r\nwould with all diligence consider the difference that is between\r\nopinionative and demonstrative doctrines: to the end that well weighing\r\nin their minds with what force necessary inferences urge us, they might\r\nthe better assure themselves that it is not in the power of the\r\nprofessors of demonstrative sciences to change their opinions at\r\npleasure, and adopt first one side and then another; and that there is a\r\ngreat difference between commanding a mathematician or a philosopher,\r\nand the disposing of a lawyer or a merchant; and that the demonstrated\r\nconclusions touching the things of nature and of the heavens cannot be\r\nchanged with the same facility as the opinions are touching what is\r\nlawful or not in a contract, bargain, or bill of exchange. Therefore,\r\nfirst let these men apply themselves to examine the arguments of\r\nCopernicus and others, and leave the condemning of them as erroneous and\r\nheretical to whom it belongeth; yet let them not hope to find such rash\r\nand precipitous determinations in the wary and holy fathers, or in the\r\nabsolute wisdom of him who cannot err, as those into which they suffer\r\nthemselves to be hurried by some particular affection or interest of\r\ntheir own. In these and such other positions, which are not directly\r\narticles of faith, certainly no man doubts but His Holiness hath always\r\nan absolute power of admitting or condemning them, but it is not in the\r\npower of any creature to make them to be true or false, otherwise than\r\nof their own nature, and in fact they are.\" We have been more particular\r\nin extracting these passages, because it has been advanced by a writer\r\nof high reputation, that the treatment which Galileo subsequently\r\nexperienced was solely in consequence of his persisting in the endeavour\r\nto prove that the Scriptures were reconcileable with the Copernican\r\ntheory[74], whereas we see here distinctly that, for the reasons we have\r\nbriefly stated, he regarded this as a matter altogether indifferent and\r\nbeside the question.\r\n\r\nGalileo had not entered upon this discussion till driven to it by a most\r\nindecent attack, made on him from the pulpit, by a Dominican friar named\r\nCaccini, who thought it not unbecoming his habit or religion to play\r\nupon the words of a Scriptural text for the purpose of attacking Galileo\r\nand his partisans with more personality.[75] Galileo complained formally\r\nof Caccini's conduct to Luigi Maraffi the general of the Dominicans, who\r\napologised amply to him, adding that he himself was to be pitied for\r\nfinding himself implicated in all the brutal conduct of thirty or forty\r\nthousand monks.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the inquisitors at Rome had taken the alarm, and were\r\nalready, in 1615, busily employed in collecting evidence against\r\nGalileo. Lorini, a brother Dominican of Caccini, had given them notice\r\nof the letter to Castelli of which we have spoken, and the utmost\r\naddress was employed to get the original into their hands, which attempt\r\nhowever was frustrated, as Castelli had returned it to the writer.\r\nCaccini was sent for to Rome, settled there with the title of Master of\r\nthe Convent of St. Mary of Minerva, and employed to put the depositions\r\nagainst Galileo into order. Galileo was not at this time fully aware of\r\nthe machinations against him, but suspecting something of their nature,\r\nhe solicited and obtained permission from Cosmo, towards the end of\r\n1615, to make a journey to Rome, for the purpose of more directly\r\nconfronting his enemies in that city. There was a rumour at the time\r\nthat this visit was not voluntary, but that Galileo had been cited to\r\nappear at Rome. A contemporary declares that he heard this from Galileo\r\nhimself: at any rate, in a letter which Galileo shortly afterwards wrote\r\nto Picchena, the Grand Duke's secretary, he expresses himself well\r\nsatisfied with the results of this step, whether forced or not, and\r\nQuerenghi thus describes to the Cardinal d'Este the public effect of his\r\nappearance: \"Your Eminence would be delighted with Galileo if you heard\r\nhim holding forth, as he often does, in the midst of fifteen or twenty,\r\nall violently attacking him, sometimes in one house, sometimes in\r\nanother. But he is armed after such fashion that he laughs all of them\r\nto scorn—and even if the novelty of his opinions prevents entire\r\npersuasion, at least he convicts of emptiness most of the arguments with\r\nwhich his adversaries endeavour to overwhelm him. He was particularly\r\nadmirable on Monday last, in the house of Signor Frederico Ghisilieri;\r\nand what especially pleased me was, that before replying to the contrary\r\narguments, he amplified and enforced them with new grounds of great\r\nplausibility, so as to leave his adversaries in a more ridiculous plight\r\nwhen he afterwards overturned them all.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the malicious stories which were put into circulation, it had been\r\nsaid, that the Grand Duke had withdrawn his favour, which emboldened\r\nmany, who would not otherwise have ventured on such open opposition, to\r\ndeclare against Galileo. His appearance at Rome, where he was lodged in\r\nthe palace of Cosmo's ambassador, and whence he kept up a close\r\ncorrespondence with the Grand Duke's family, put an immediate stop to\r\nrumours of this kind. In little more than a month he was apparently\r\ntriumphant, so far as regarded himself; but the question now began to be\r\nagitated whether the whole system of Copernicus ought not to be\r\ncondemned as impious and heretical. Galileo again writes to Picchena,\r\n\"so far as concerns the clearing of my own character, I might return\r\nhome immediately; but although this new question regards me no more than\r\nall those who for the last eighty years have supported these opinions\r\nboth in public and private, yet, as perhaps I may be of some assistance\r\nin that part of the discussion which depends on the knowledge of truths\r\nascertained by means of the sciences which I profess, I, as a zealous\r\nand Catholic Christian, neither can nor ought to withhold that\r\nassistance which my knowledge affords; and this business keeps me\r\nsufficiently employed.\" De Lambre, whose readiness to depreciate\r\nGalileo's merit we have already noticed and lamented, sneeringly and\r\nungratefully remarks on this part of his life, that \"it was scarcely\r\nworth while to compromise his tranquillity and reputation, in order to\r\nbecome the champion of a truth which could not fail every day to acquire\r\nnew partisans by the natural effect of the progress of enlightened\r\nopinions.\" We need not stop to consider what the natural effects might\r\nhave been if none had at any time been found who thought their\r\ntranquillity worthily offered up in such a cause.\r\n\r\nIt has been hinted by several, and is indeed probable, that Galileo's\r\nstay at Rome rather injured the cause (so far as provoking the\r\ninquisitorial censures could injure it) which it was his earnest desire\r\nto serve, for we cannot often enough repeat the assertion, that it was\r\nnot the doctrine itself, so much as the free, unyielding manner in which\r\nit was supported, which was originally obnoxious. Copernicus had been\r\nallowed to dedicate his great work to Pope Paul III., and from the time\r\nof its first appearance under that sanction in 1543, to the year 1616,\r\nof which we are now writing, this theory was left in the hands of\r\nmathematicians and philosophers, who alternately attacked and defended\r\nit without receiving either support or molestation from ecclesiastical\r\ndecrees. But this was henceforward no longer the case, and a higher\r\ndegree of importance was given to the controversy from the religious\r\nheresies which were asserted to be involved in the new opinions. We have\r\nalready given specimens of the so called philosophical arguments brought\r\nagainst Copernicus; and the reader may be curious to know the form of\r\nthe theological ones. Those which we select are taken from a work, which\r\nindeed did not come forth till the time of Galileo's third visit to\r\nRome, but it is relative to the matter now before us, as it professed to\r\nbe, and its author's party affected to consider it, a complete\r\nrefutation of the letters to Castelli and the Archduchess Christina.[76]\r\n\r\nIt was the work of a Jesuit, Melchior Inchoffer, and it was greatly\r\nextolled by his companions, \"as differing so entirely from the pruriency\r\nof the Pythagorean writings.\" He quotes with approbation an author who,\r\nfirst referring to the first verse of Genesis for an argument that the\r\nearth was not created till after the heavens, observes that the whole\r\nquestion is thus reduced to the examination of this purely geometrical\r\ndifficulty—In the formation of a sphere, does the centre or\r\ncircumference first come into existence? If the latter (which we presume\r\nMelchior's friend found good reason for deciding upon), the consequence\r\nis inevitable. The earth is in the centre of the universe.\r\n\r\nIt may not be unprofitable to contrast the extracts which we have given\r\nfrom Galileo's letters on the same subject with the following passage,\r\nwhich appears one of the most subtle and argumentative which is to be\r\nfound in Melchior's book. He _professes_ to be enumerating and refuting\r\nthe principal arguments which the Copernicans adduced for the motion of\r\nthe earth. \"Fifth argument. Hell is in the centre of the earth, and in\r\nit is a fire tormenting the damned; therefore it is absolutely necessary\r\nthat the earth is moveable. The antecedent is plain.\" (Inchoffer then\r\nquotes a number of texts of Scripture on which, according to him, the\r\nCopernicans relied in proof of this part of the argument.) \"The\r\nconsequent is proved: because fire is the cause of motion, for which\r\nreason Pythagoras, who, as Aristotle reports, puts the place of\r\npunishment in the centre, perceived that the earth is animate and\r\nendowed with action. I answer, even allowing that hell is in the centre\r\nof the earth, and a fire in it, I deny the consequence: and for proof I\r\nsay, if the argument is worth any thing, it proves also that lime-kilns,\r\novens, and fire-grates are animated and spontaneously moveable. I say,\r\n_even allowing_ that hell is in the centre of the earth: for Gregory,\r\nbook 4, dial. chap. 42, says, that he dare not decide rashly on this\r\nmatter, although he thinks more probable the opinion of those who say\r\nthat it is under the earth. St. Thomas, in Opusc. 10, art. 31, says:\r\nWhere hell is, whether in the centre of the earth or at the surface,\r\ndoes not in my opinion, relate to any article of faith; and it is\r\nsuperfluous to be solicitous about such things, either in asserting or\r\ndenying them. And Opusc. 11, art. 24, he says, that it seems to him that\r\nnothing should be rashly asserted on this matter, particularly as\r\nAugustin thinks that nobody knows where it is; but I do not, says he,\r\nthink that it is in the centre of the earth. I should be loth, however,\r\nthat it should be hence inferred by _some people_ that hell is in the\r\nearth, that we are ignorant where hell is, and therefore that the\r\nsituation of the earth is also unknown, and, in conclusion, that it\r\ncannot therefore be the centre of the universe. The argument shall be\r\nretorted in another fashion: for if the place of the earth is unknown,\r\nit cannot be said to be in a great circle, so as to be moved round the\r\nsun. Finally I say that in fact it is known where the earth is.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that some persons adopted the Copernican theory,\r\nfrom an affectation of singularity and freethinking, without being able\r\nto give very sound reasons for their change of opinion, of whom we have\r\nan instance in Origanus, the astrological instructor of Wallenstein's\r\nfamous attendant Seni, who edited his work. His arguments in favour of\r\nthe earth's motion are quite on a level with those advanced on the\r\nopposite side in favour of its immobility; but we have not found any\r\ntraces whatever of such absurdities as these having been urged by any of\r\nthe leaders of that party, and it is far more probable that they are the\r\ncreatures of Melchior's own imagination. At any rate it is worth\r\nremarking how completely he disregards the real physical arguments,\r\nwhich he ought, in justice to his cause, to have attempted to\r\ncontrovert. His book was aimed at Galileo and his adherents, and it is\r\nscarcely possible that he could seriously persuade himself that he was\r\nstating and overturning arguments similar to those by which Galileo had\r\nmade so many converts to the opinions of Copernicus. Whatever may be our\r\njudgment of his candour, we may at least feel assured that if this had\r\nindeed been a fair specimen of Galileo's philosophy, he might to the end\r\nof his life have taught that the earth moved round the sun, or if his\r\nfancy led him to a different hypothesis, he might like the Abbé Baliani\r\nhave sent the earth spinning round the stationary moon, and like him\r\nhave remained unmolested by pontifical censures. It is true that Baliani\r\nowned his opinion to be much shaken, on observing it to be opposed to\r\nthe decree of those in whose hands was placed the power of judging\r\narticles of faith. But Galileo's uncompromising spirit of analytical\r\ninvestigation, and the sober but invincible force of reasoning with\r\nwhich he beat down every sophism opposed to him, the instruments with\r\nwhich he worked, were more odious than the work itself, and the\r\ncondemnation which he had vainly hoped to avert was probably on his very\r\naccount accelerated.\r\n\r\nGalileo, according to his own story, had in March 1616 a most gracious\r\naudience of the pope, Paul V., which lasted for nearly an hour, at the\r\nend of which his holiness assured him, that the Congregation were no\r\nlonger in a humour to listen lightly to calumnies against him, and that\r\nso long as he occupied the papal chair, Galileo might think himself out\r\nof all danger. But nevertheless he was not allowed to return home,\r\nwithout receiving formal notice not to teach the opinions of\r\nCopernicus, that the sun is in the centre of the system, and that the\r\nearth moves about it, from that time forward, in any manner. That these\r\nwere the literal orders given to Galileo will be presently proved from\r\nthe recital of them in the famous decree against him, seventeen years\r\nlater. For the present, his letters which we have mentioned, as well as\r\none of a similar tendency by Foscarini, a Carmelite friar—a commentary\r\non the book of Joshua by a Spaniard named Diego Zuniga—Kepler's Epitome\r\nof the Copernican Theory—and Copernicus's own work, were inserted in\r\nthe list of forbidden books, nor was it till four years afterwards, in\r\n1620, that, on reconsideration, Copernicus was allowed to be read with\r\ncertain omissions and alterations then decided upon.\r\n\r\nGalileo quitted Rome scarcely able to conceal his contempt and\r\nindignation. Two years afterwards this spirit had but little subsided,\r\nfor in forwarding to the Archduke Leopold his Theory of the Tides, he\r\naccompanied it with the following remarks:—\"This theory occurred to me\r\nwhen in Rome, whilst the theologians were debating on the prohibition of\r\nCopernicus's book, and of the opinion maintained in it of the motion of\r\nthe earth, which I at that time believed; until it pleased those\r\ngentlemen to suspend the book, and declare the opinion false and\r\nrepugnant to the Holy Scriptures. Now, as I know how well it becomes me\r\nto obey and believe the decisions of my superiors, which proceed out of\r\nmore profound knowledge than the weakness of my intellect can attain to,\r\nthis theory which I send you, which is founded on the motion of the\r\nearth, I now look upon as a fiction and a dream, and beg your highness\r\nto receive it as such. But, as poets often learn to prize the creations\r\nof their fancy, so, in like manner, do I set some value on this\r\nabsurdity of mine. It is true that when I sketched this little work, I\r\ndid hope that Copernicus would not, after 80 years, be convicted of\r\nerror, and I had intended to develope and amplify it farther, but a\r\nvoice from heaven suddenly awakened me, and at once annihilated all my\r\nconfused and entangled fancies.\"\r\n\r\nIt might have been predicted, from the tone of this letter alone, that\r\nit would not be long before Galileo would again bring himself under the\r\ncensuring notice of the astronomical hierarchy, and indeed he had, so\r\nearly as 1610, collected some of the materials for the work which caused\r\nthe final explosion, and on which he now employed himself with as little\r\nintermission as the weak state of his health permitted.\r\n\r\nHe had been before this time engaged in a correspondence with the court\r\nof Spain, on the method of observing longitudes at sea, for the solution\r\nof which important problem Philip III. had offered a considerable\r\nreward, an example which has since been followed in our own and other\r\ncountries. Galileo had no sooner discovered Jupiter's satellites, than\r\nhe recognized the use which might be made of them for that purpose, and\r\ndevoted himself with peculiar assiduity to acquiring as perfect a\r\nknowledge as possible of their revolutions. The reader will easily\r\nunderstand how they were to be used, if their motion could be so well\r\nascertained as to enable Galileo at Florence to predict the exact times\r\nat which any remarkable configurations would occur, as, for instance,\r\nthe times at which any one of them would be eclipsed by Jupiter. A\r\nmariner who in the middle of the Atlantic should observe the same\r\neclipse, and compare the time of night at which he made the observation\r\n(which he might know by setting his watch by the sun on the preceding\r\nday) with the time mentioned in the predictions, would, from the\r\ndifference between the two, learn the difference between the hour at\r\nFlorence and the hour at the place where the ship at that time happened\r\nto be. As the earth turns uniformly round through 360° of longitude in\r\n24 hours, that is, through 15° in each hour, the hours, minutes, and\r\nseconds of time which express this difference must be multiplied by 15,\r\nand the respective products will give the degrees, minutes, and seconds\r\nof longitude, by which the ship was then distant from Florence. This\r\nstatement is merely intended to give those who are unacquainted with\r\nastronomy, a general idea of the manner in which it was proposed to use\r\nthese satellites. Our moon had already been occasionally employed in the\r\nsame way, but the comparative frequency of the eclipses of Jupiter's\r\nmoons, and the suddenness with which they disappear, gives a decided\r\nadvantage to the new method. Both methods were embarrassed by the\r\ndifficulty of observing the eclipses at sea. In addition to this, it was\r\nrequisite, in both methods, that the sailors should be provided with\r\naccurate means of knowing the hour, wherever they might chance to be,\r\nwhich was far from being the case, for although (in order not to\r\ninterrupt the explanation) we have above spoken of their _watches_, yet\r\nthe watches and clocks of that day were not such as could be relied on\r\nsufficiently, during the interval which must necessarily occur between\r\nthe two observations. This consideration led Galileo to reflect on the\r\nuse which might be made of his pendulum for this purpose; and, with\r\nrespect to the other difficulty, he contrived a peculiar kind of\r\ntelescope, with which he flattered himself, somewhat prematurely, that\r\nit would be as easy to observe on ship-board as on shore.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Rome, in 1615, and the following year, he disclosed\r\nsome of these ideas to the Conte di Lemos, the viceroy of Naples, who\r\nhad been president of the council of the Spanish Indies, and was fully\r\naware of the importance of the matter. Galileo was in consequence\r\ninvited to communicate directly with the Duke of Lerma, the Spanish\r\nminister, and instructions were accordingly sent by Cosmo, to the Conte\r\nOrso d'Elci, his ambassador at Madrid, to conduct the business there.\r\nGalileo entered warmly into the design, of which he had no other means\r\nof verifying the practicability; for as he says in one of his letters to\r\nSpain—\"Your excellency may well believe that if this were an\r\nundertaking which I could conclude by myself, I would never have gone\r\nabout begging favours from others; but in my study there are neither\r\nseas, nor Indies, nor islands, nor ports, nor shoals, nor ships, for\r\nwhich reason I am compelled to share the enterprise with great\r\npersonages, and to fatigue myself to procure the acceptance of that,\r\nwhich ought with eagerness to be asked of me; but I console myself with\r\nthe reflection that I am not singular in this, but that it commonly\r\nhappens, with the exception of a little reputation, and that too often\r\nobscured and blackened by envy, that the least part of the advantage\r\nfalls to the share of the inventors of things, which afterwards bring\r\ngreat gain, honours, and riches to others; so that I will never cease on\r\nmy part to do every thing in my power, and I am ready to leave here all\r\nmy comforts, my country, my friends, and family, and to cross over into\r\nSpain, to stay as long as I may be wanted in Seville, or Lisbon, or\r\nwherever it may be convenient, to implant the knowledge of this method,\r\nprovided that due assistance and diligence be not wanting on the part of\r\nthose who are to receive it, and who should solicit and foster it.\" But\r\nhe could not, with all his enthusiasm, rouse the attention of the\r\nSpanish court. The negotiation languished, and although occasionally\r\nrenewed during the next ten or twelve years, was never brought to a\r\nsatisfactory issue. Some explanation of this otherwise unaccountable\r\napathy of the Spanish court, with regard to the solution of a problem\r\nwhich they had certainly much at heart, is given in Nelli's life of\r\nGalileo; where it is asserted, on the authority of the Florentine\r\nrecords, that Cosmo required privately from Spain, (in return for the\r\npermission granted for Galileo to leave Florence, in pursuance of this\r\ndesign,) the privilege of sending every year from Leghorn two\r\nmerchantmen, duty free, to the Spanish Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[74] Ce philosophe (Galilée) ne fut point persecuté comme bon astronome,\r\nmais comme mauvais théologien. C'est son entêtement à vouloir concilier\r\nla Bible avec Copernic qui lui donna des juges. Mais vingt auteurs,\r\nsurtout parmi les protestans, ont écrit que Galilée fut persecuté et\r\nimprisonné pour avoir soutenu que la terre tourne autour du soleil, que\r\nce système a été condanné par l'inquisition comme faux, erroné et\r\ncontraire à la Bible, &c.—Bergier, Encyclopédie Méthodique, Paris,\r\n1790, Art.

The motto is\r\n\"_His fixa quiescit_,\" \"Fixed by these it is at rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    _Controversy on Comets—Saggiatore—Galileo's reception by Urban\r\n      VIII—His family._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE year 1618 was remarkable for the appearance of three comets, on\r\nwhich almost every astronomer in Europe found something to say and\r\nwrite. Galileo published some of his opinions with respect to them,\r\nthrough the medium of Mario Guiducci. This astronomer delivered a\r\nlecture before the Florentine academy, the heads of which he was\r\nsupposed to have received from Galileo, who, during the whole time of\r\nthe appearance of these comets, was confined to his bed by severe\r\nillness. This essay was printed in Florence _at the sign of The Medicean\r\nStars_.[77] What principally deserves notice in it, is the opinion of\r\nGalileo, that the distance of a comet cannot be safely determined by its\r\nparallax, from which we learn that he inclined to believe that comets\r\nare nothing but meteors occasionally appearing in the atmosphere, like\r\nrainbows, parhelia, and similar phenomena. He points out the difference\r\nin this respect between a fixed object, the distance of which may be\r\ncalculated from the difference of direction in which two observers (at a\r\nknown distance from each other) are obliged to turn themselves in order\r\nto see it, and meteors like the rainbow, which are simultaneously formed\r\nin different drops of water for each spectator, so that two observers\r\nin different places are in fact contemplating different objects. He then\r\nwarns astronomers not to engage with too much warmth in a discussion on\r\nthe distance of comets before they assure themselves to which of these\r\ntwo classes of phenomena they are to be referred. The remark is in\r\nitself perfectly just, although the opinion which occasioned it is now\r\nas certainly known to be erroneous, but it is questionable whether the\r\nobservations which, up to that time, had been made upon comets, were\r\nsufficient, either in number or quality, to justify the censure which\r\nhas been cast on Galileo for his opinion. The theory, moreover, is\r\nmerely introduced as an hypothesis in Guiducci's essay. The same opinion\r\nwas for a short time embraced by Cassini, a celebrated Italian\r\nastronomer, invited by Louis XIV. to the Observatory at Paris, when the\r\nscience was considerably more advanced, and Newton, in his _Principia_,\r\ndid not think it unworthy of him to show on what grounds it is\r\nuntenable.\r\n\r\nGalileo was become the object of animosity in so many quarters that none\r\nof his published opinions, whether correct or incorrect, ever wanted a\r\nready antagonist. The champion on the present occasion was again a\r\nJesuit; his name was Oratio Grassi, who published _The Astronomical and\r\nPhilosophical Balance_, under the disguised signature of Lotario Sarsi.\r\n\r\nGalileo and his friends were anxious that his reply to Grassi should\r\nappear as quickly as possible, but his health had become so precarious\r\nand his frequent illnesses occasioned so many interruptions, that it was\r\nnot until the autumn of 1623 that Il Saggiatore (or The Assayer) as he\r\ncalled his answer, was ready for publication. This was printed by the\r\nLyncean Academy, and as Cardinal Maffeo Barberino, who had just been\r\nelected Pope, (with the title of Urban VIII.) had been closely connected\r\nwith that society, and was also a personal friend of Cesi and of\r\nGalileo, it was thought a prudent precaution to dedicate the pamphlet to\r\nhim. This essay enjoys a peculiar reputation among Galileo's works, not\r\nonly for the matter contained in it, but also for the style in which it\r\nis written; insomuch that Andrès[78], when eulogizing Galileo as one of\r\nthe earliest who adorned philosophical truths with the graces and\r\nornaments of language, expressly instances the Saggiatore, which is also\r\nquoted by Frisi and Algarotti, as a perfect model of this sort of\r\ncomposition. In the latter particular, it is unsafe to interfere with\r\nthe decisions of an Italian critic; but with respect to its substance,\r\nthis famous composition scarcely appears to deserve its preeminent\r\nreputation. It is a prolix and rather tedious examination of Grassi's\r\nEssay; nor do the arguments seem so satisfactory, nor the reasonings so\r\ncompact as is generally the case in Galileo's other writings. It does\r\nhowever, like all his other works, contain many very remarkable\r\npassages, and the celebrity of this production requires that we should\r\nextract one or two of the most characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe first, though a very short one, will serve to shew the tone which\r\nGalileo had taken with respect to the Copernican system since its\r\ncondemnation at Rome, in 1616. \"In conclusion, since the motion\r\nattributed to the earth, which I, as a pious and Catholic person,\r\nconsider most false, and not to exist, accommodates itself so well to\r\nexplain so many and such different phenomena, I shall not feel sure,\r\nunless Sarsi descends to more distinct considerations than those which\r\nhe has yet produced, that, false as it is, it may not just as deludingly\r\ncorrespond with the phenomena of comets.\"\r\n\r\nSarsi had quoted a story from Suidas in support of his argument that\r\nmotion always produces heat, how the Babylonians used to cook their eggs\r\nby whirling them in a sling; to which Galileo replies: \"I cannot refrain\r\nfrom marvelling that Sarsi will persist in proving to me, by\r\nauthorities, that which at any moment I can bring to the test of\r\nexperiment. We examine witnesses in things which are doubtful, past, and\r\nnot permanent, but not in those things which are done in our own\r\npresence. If discussing a difficult problem were like carrying a weight,\r\nsince several horses will carry more sacks of corn than one alone will,\r\nI would agree that many reasoners avail more than one; but _discoursing_\r\nis like _coursing_, and not like carrying, and one barb by himself will\r\nrun farther than a hundred Friesland horses. When Sarsi brings up such a\r\nmultitude of authors, it does not seem to me that he in the least degree\r\nstrengthens his own conclusions, but he ennobles the cause of Signor\r\nMario and myself, by shewing that we reason better than many men of\r\nestablished reputation. If Sarsi insists that I believe, on Suidas'\r\ncredit, that the Babylonians cooked eggs by swiftly whirling them in a\r\nsling, I will believe it; but I must needs say, that the cause of such\r\nan effect is very remote from that to which it is attributed, and to\r\nfind the true cause I shall reason thus. If an effect does not follow\r\nwith us which followed with others at another time, it is because, in\r\nour experiment, something is wanting which was the cause of the former\r\nsuccess; and if only one thing is wanting to us, that one thing is the\r\ntrue cause. Now we have eggs, and slings, and strong men to whirl them,\r\nand yet they will not become cooked; nay, if they were hot at first,\r\nthey more quickly become cold: and since nothing is wanting to us but to\r\nbe Babylonians, it follows that being Babylonians is the true cause why\r\nthe eggs became hard, and not the friction of the air, which is what I\r\nwished to prove.—Is it possible that in travelling post, Sarsi has\r\nnever noticed what freshness is occasioned on the face by the continual\r\nchange of air? and if he has felt it, will he rather trust the relation\r\nby others, of what was done two thousand years ago at Babylon, than what\r\nhe can at this moment verify in his own person? I at least will not be\r\nso wilfully wrong, and so ungrateful to nature and to God, that having\r\nbeen gifted with sense and language, I should voluntarily set less value\r\non such great endowments than on the fallacies of a fellow man, and\r\nblindly and blunderingly believe whatever I hear, and barter the freedom\r\nof my intellect for slavery to one as liable to error as myself.\"\r\n\r\nOur final extract shall exhibit a sample of Galileo's metaphysics, in\r\nwhich may be observed the germ of a theory very closely allied to that\r\nwhich was afterwards developed by Locke and Berkeley.—\"I have now only\r\nto fulfil my promise of declaring my opinions on the proposition that\r\nmotion is the cause of heat, and to explain in what manner it appears to\r\nme that it may be true. But I must first make some remarks on that which\r\nwe call heat, since I strongly suspect that a notion of it prevails\r\nwhich is very remote from the truth; for it is believed that there is a\r\ntrue accident, affection, and quality, really inherent in the substance\r\nby which we feel ourselves heated. This much I have to say, that so soon\r\nas I conceive a material or corporeal substance, I simultaneously feel\r\nthe necessity of conceiving that it has its boundaries, and is of some\r\nshape or other; that, relatively to others, it is great or small; that\r\nit is in this or that place, in this or that time; that it is in motion,\r\nor at rest; that it touches, or does not touch another body; that it is\r\nunique, rare, or common; nor can I, by any act of the imagination,\r\ndisjoin it from these qualities: but I do not find myself absolutely\r\ncompelled to apprehend it as necessarily accompanied by such conditions,\r\nas that it must be white or red, bitter or sweet, sonorous or silent,\r\nsmelling sweetly or disagreeably; and if the senses had not pointed out\r\nthese qualities, it is probable that language and imagination alone\r\ncould never have arrived at them. Because, I am inclined to think that\r\nthese tastes, smells, colours, &c., with regard to the subject in which\r\nthey appear to reside, are nothing more than mere names, and exist only\r\nin the sensitive body; insomuch that, when the living creature is\r\nremoved, all these qualities are carried off and annihilated; although\r\nwe have imposed particular names upon them, and different from those of\r\nthe other first and real accidents, and would fain persuade ourselves\r\nthat they are truly and in fact distinct. But I do not believe that\r\nthere exists any thing in external bodies for exciting tastes, smells,\r\nand sounds, but size, shape, quantity, and motion, swift or slow; and if\r\nears, tongues, and noses were removed, I am of opinion that shape,\r\nnumber, and motion would remain, but there would be an end of smells,\r\ntastes, and sounds, which, abstractedly from the living creature, I take\r\nto be mere words.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring following the publication of the \"Saggiatore,\" that is to\r\nsay, about the time of Easter, in 1624, Galileo went a third time to\r\nRome to compliment Urban on his elevation to the pontifical chair. He\r\nwas obliged to make this journey in a litter; and it appears from his\r\nletters that for some years he had been seldom able to bear any other\r\nmode of conveyance. In such a state of health it seems unlikely that he\r\nwould have quitted home on a mere visit of ceremony, which suspicion is\r\nstrengthened by the beginning of a letter from him to Prince Cesi, dated\r\nin October, 1623, in which he says: \"I have received the very courteous\r\nand prudent advice of your excellency about the time and manner of my\r\ngoing to Rome, and shall act upon it; and I will visit you at Acqua\r\nSparta, that I may be completely informed of the actual state of things\r\nat Rome.\" However this may be, nothing could be more gratifying than his\r\npublic reception there. His stay in Rome did not exceed two months,\r\n(from the beginning of April till June,) and during that time he was\r\nadmitted to six long and satisfactory interviews with the Pope, and on\r\nhis departure received the promise of a pension for his son Vincenzo,\r\nand was himself presented with \"a fine painting, two medals, one of gold\r\nand the other of silver, and a good quantity of agnus dei.\" He had also\r\nmuch communication with several of the cardinals, one of whom, Cardinal\r\nHohenzoller, told him that he had represented to the pope on the subject\r\nof Copernicus, that \"all the heretics were of that opinion, and\r\nconsidered it as undoubted; and that it would be necessary to be very\r\ncircumspect in coming to any resolution: to which his holiness replied,\r\nthat the church had not condemned it, nor was it to be condemned as\r\nheretical, but only as rash; adding, that there was no fear of any one\r\nundertaking to prove that it must necessarily be true.\" Urban also\r\naddressed a letter to Ferdinand, who had succeeded his father Cosmo as\r\nGrand Duke of Tuscany, expressly for the purpose of recommending Galileo\r\nto him. \"For We find in him not only literary distinction, but also the\r\nlove of piety, and he is strong in those qualities by which pontifical\r\ngood-will is easily obtained. And now, when he has been brought to this\r\ncity to congratulate Us on Our elevation, We have very lovingly embraced\r\nhim;—nor can We suffer him to return to the country whither your\r\nliberality recalls him without an ample provision of pontifical love.\r\nAnd that you may know how dear he is to Us, We have willed to give him\r\nthis honourable testimonial of virtue and piety. And We further signify\r\nthat every benefit which you shall confer upon him, imitating, or even\r\nsurpassing your father's liberality, will conduce to Our gratification.\"\r\nHonoured with these unequivocal marks of approbation, Galileo returned\r\nto Florence.\r\n\r\nHis son Vincenzo is soon afterwards spoken of as being at Rome; and it\r\nis not improbable that Galileo sent him thither on the appointment of\r\nhis friend and pupil, the Abbé Castelli, to be mathematician to the\r\npope. Vincenzo had been legitimated by an edict of Cosmo in 1619, and,\r\naccording to Nelli, married, in 1624, Sestilia, the daughter of Carlo\r\nBocchineri. There are no traces to be found of Vincenzo's mother after\r\n1610, and perhaps she died about that time. Galileo's family by her\r\nconsisted of Vincenzo and two daughters, Julia and Polissena, who both\r\ntook the veil in the convent of Saint Matthew at Arcetri, under the\r\nnames of Sister Arcangiola and Sister Maria Celeste. The latter is said\r\nto have possessed extraordinary talents. The date of Vincenzo's\r\nmarriage, as given by Nelli, appears somewhat inconsistent with the\r\ncorrespondence between Galileo and Castelli, in which, so late as 1629,\r\nGalileo is apparently writing of his son as a student under Castelli's\r\nsuperintendence, and intimates the amount of pocket-money he can afford\r\nto allow him, which he fixes at three crowns a month; adding, that \"he\r\nought to be contented with as many crowns, as, at his age, I possessed\r\ngroats.\" Castelli had given but an unfavourable account of Vincenzo's\r\nconduct, characterizing him as \"dissolute, obstinate, and impudent;\" in\r\nconsequence of which behaviour, Galileo seems to have thought that the\r\npension of sixty crowns, which had been granted by the pope, might be\r\nturned to better account than by employing it on his son's education;\r\nand accordingly in his reply he requested Castelli to dispose of it,\r\nobserving that the proceeds would be useful in assisting him to\r\ndischarge a great load of debt with which he found himself saddled on\r\naccount of his brother's family. Besides this pension, another of one\r\nhundred crowns was in a few years granted by Urban to Galileo himself,\r\nbut it appears to have been very irregularly paid, if at all.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Galileo found himself menaced either with the\r\ndeprivation of his stipend as extraordinary professor at Pisa, or with\r\nthe loss of that leisure which, on his removal to Florence, he had been\r\nso anxious to secure. In 1629, the question was agitated by the party\r\nopposed to him, whether it were in the power of the grand duke to assign\r\na pension out of the funds of the University, arising out of\r\necclesiastical dues, to one who neither lectured nor resided there. This\r\nscruple had slept during nineteen years which had elapsed since\r\nGalileo's establishment in Florence, but probably those who now raised\r\nit reckoned upon finding in Ferdinand II., then scarcely of age, a less\r\nfirm supporter of Galileo than his father Cosmo had been. But the matter\r\ndid not proceed so far; for, after full deliberation, the prevalent\r\nopinion of the theologians and jurists who were consulted appeared to be\r\nin favour of this exercise of prerogative, and accordingly Galileo\r\nretained his stipend and privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[77] In Firenze nella Stamperia di Pietro Cecconcelli alle stelle\r\nMedicee, 1619.\r\n\r\n[78] Dell'Origine d'ogni Literatura: Parma, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    _Publication of Galileo's 'System of the World'—His Condemnation\r\n      and Abjuration._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year 1630, Galileo brought to its conclusion his great work, \"The\r\nDialogue on the Ptolemaic and Copernican Systems,\" and began to take the\r\nnecessary steps for procuring permission to print it. This was to be\r\nobtained in the first instance from an officer at Rome, entitled the\r\nmaster of the sacred palace; and after a little negotiation Galileo\r\nfound it would be necessary for him again to return thither, as his\r\nenemies were still busy in thwarting his views and wishes. Niccolo\r\nRiccardi, who at that time filled the office of master of the palace,\r\nhad been a pupil of Galileo, and was well disposed to facilitate his\r\nplans; he pointed out, however, some expressions in the work which he\r\nthought it necessary to erase, and, with the understanding that this\r\nshould be done, he returned the manuscript to Galileo with his\r\nsubscribed approbation. The unhealthy season was drawing near, and\r\nGalileo, unwilling to face it, returned home, where he intended to\r\ncomplete the index and dedication, and then to send it back to Rome to\r\nbe printed in that city, under the superintendence of Federigo Cesi.\r\nThis plan was disconcerted by the premature death of that accomplished\r\nnobleman, in August 1630, in whom Galileo lost one of his steadiest and\r\nmost effective friends and protectors. This unfortunate event determined\r\nGalileo to attempt to procure permission to print his book at Florence.\r\nA contagious disorder had broken out in Tuscany with such severity as\r\nalmost to interrupt all communication between Florence and Rome, and\r\nthis was urged by Galileo as an additional reason for granting his\r\nrequest. Riccardi at first seemed inclined to insist that the book\r\nshould be sent to him a second time, but at last contented himself with\r\ninspecting the commencement and conclusion, and consented that (on its\r\nreceiving also a license from the inquisitor-general at Florence, and\r\nfrom one or two others whose names appear on the title-page) it might be\r\nprinted where Galileo wished.\r\n\r\nThese protracted negotiations prevented the publication of the work till\r\nlate in 1632; it then appeared, with a dedication to Ferdinand, under\r\nthe following title:—\"A Dialogue, by Galileo Galilei, Extraordinary\r\nMathematician of the University of Pisa, and Principal Philosopher and\r\nMathematician of the Most Serene Grand Duke of Tuscany; in which, in a\r\nconversation of four days, are discussed the two principal Systems of\r\nthe World, the Ptolemaic and Copernican, indeterminately proposing the\r\nPhilosophical Arguments as well on one side as on the other.\" The\r\nbeginning of the introduction, which is addressed \"To the discreet\r\nReader,\" is much too characteristic to be passed by without\r\nnotice.—\"Some years ago, a salutary edict was promulgated at Rome,\r\nwhich, in order to obviate the perilous scandals of the present age,\r\nenjoined an opportune silence on the Pythagorean opinion of the earth's\r\nmotion. Some were not wanting, who rashly asserted that this decree\r\noriginated, not in a judicious examination, but in ill informed passion;\r\nand complaints were heard that counsellors totally inexperienced in\r\nastronomical observations ought not by hasty prohibitions to clip the\r\nwings of speculative minds. My zeal could not keep silence when I heard\r\nthese rash lamentations, and I thought it proper, as being fully\r\ninformed with regard to that most prudent determination, to appear\r\npublicly on the theatre of the world as a witness of the actual truth. I\r\nhappened at that time to be in Rome: I was admitted to the audiences,\r\nand enjoyed the approbation of the most eminent prelates of that court,\r\nnor did the publication of that decree occur without my receiving some\r\nprior intimation of it.[79] Wherefore it is my intention in this present\r\nwork, to show to foreign nations that as much is known of this matter in\r\nItaly, and particularly in Rome, as ultramontane diligence can ever have\r\nformed any notion of, and collecting together all my own speculations on\r\nthe Copernican system, to give them to understand that the knowledge of\r\nall these preceded the Roman censures, and that from this country\r\nproceed not only dogmas for the salvation of the soul, but also\r\ningenious discoveries for the gratification of the understanding. With\r\nthis object, I have taken up in the Dialogue the Copernican side of the\r\nquestion, treating it as a pure mathematical hypothesis; and\r\nendeavouring in every artificial manner to represent it as having the\r\nadvantage, not over the opinion of the stability of the earth\r\nabsolutely, but according to the manner in which that opinion is\r\ndefended by some, who indeed profess to be Peripatetics, but retain only\r\nthe name, and are contented without improvement to worship shadows, not\r\nphilosophizing with their own reason, but only from the recollection of\r\nfour principles imperfectly understood.\"—This very flimsy veil could\r\nscarcely blind any one as to Galileo's real views in composing this\r\nwork, nor does it seem probable that he framed it with any expectation\r\nof appearing neutral in the discussion. It is more likely that he\r\nflattered himself that, under the new government at Rome, he was not\r\nlikely to be molested on account of the personal prohibition which he\r\nhad received in 1616, \"not to believe or teach the motion of the earth\r\nin any manner,\" provided he kept himself within the letter of the limits\r\nof the more public and general order, that the Copernican system was not\r\nto be brought forward otherwise than as a mere mathematically\r\nconvenient, but in fact unreal supposition. So long as this decree\r\nremained in force, a due regard to consistency would compel the Roman\r\nInquisitors to notice an unequivocal violation of it; and this is\r\nprobably what Urban had implied in the remark quoted by Hohenzoller to\r\nGalileo.[80] There were not wanting circumstances which might compensate\r\nfor the loss of Cosmo and of Federigo Cesi; Cosmo had been succeeded by\r\nhis son, who, though he had not yet attained his father's energy, showed\r\nhimself as friendly as possible to Galileo. Cardinal Bellarmine, who had\r\nbeen mainly instrumental in procuring the decree of 1616, was dead;\r\nUrban on the contrary, who had been among the few Cardinals who then\r\nopposed it as uncalled for and ill-advised, was now possessed of supreme\r\npower, and his recent affability seemed to prove that the increased\r\ndifference in their stations had not caused him to forget their early\r\nand long-continued intimacy. It is probable that Galileo would not have\r\nfound himself mistaken in this estimate of his position, but for an\r\nunlucky circumstance, of which his enemies immediately saw the\r\nimportance, and which they were not slow in making available against\r\nhim. The dialogue of Galileo's work is conducted between three\r\npersonages;—Salviati and Sagredo, who were two noblemen, friends of\r\nGalileo, and Simplicio, a name borrowed from a noted commentator upon\r\nAristotle, who wrote in the sixth century. Salviati is the principal\r\nphilosopher of the work; it is to him that the others apply for\r\nsolutions of their doubts and difficulties, and on him the principal\r\ntask falls of explaining the tenets of the Copernican theory. Sagredo is\r\nonly a half convert, but an acute and ingenious one; to him are allotted\r\nthe objections which seem to have some real difficulty in them, as well\r\nas lively illustrations and digressions, which might have been thought\r\ninconsistent with the gravity of Salviati's character. Simplicio, though\r\ncandid and modest, is of course a confirmed Ptolemaist and Aristotelian,\r\nand is made to produce successively all the popular arguments of that\r\nschool in support of his master's system. Placed between the wit and the\r\nphilosopher, it may be guessed that his success is very indifferent, and\r\nin fact he is alternately ridiculed and confuted at every turn. As\r\nGalileo racked his memory and invention to leave unanswered no argument\r\nwhich was or could be advanced against Copernicus, it unfortunately\r\nhappened, that he introduced some which Urban himself had urged upon him\r\nin their former controversies on this subject; and Galileo's opponents\r\nfound means to make His Holiness believe that the character of Simplicio\r\nhad been sketched in personal derision of him. We do not think it\r\nnecessary to exonerate Galileo from this charge; the obvious folly of\r\nsuch an useless piece of ingratitude speaks sufficiently for itself. But\r\nself-love is easily irritated; and Urban, who aspired to a reputation\r\nfor literature and science, was peculiarly sensitive on this point. His\r\nown expressions almost prove his belief that such had been Galileo's\r\ndesign, and it seems to explain the otherwise inexplicable change which\r\ntook place in his conduct towards his old friend, on account of a book\r\nwhich he had himself undertaken to examine, and of which he had\r\nauthorised the publication.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest notices of what was approaching, is found in the\r\ndispatches, dated August 24, 1632, from Ferdinand's minister, Andrea\r\nCioli, to Francesco Nicolini, the Tuscan ambassador at the court of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n\"I have orders to signify to Your Excellency that His Highness remains\r\ngreatly astonished that a book, placed by the author himself in the\r\nhands of the supreme authority in Rome, read and read again there most\r\nattentively, and in which every thing, not only with the consent, but at\r\nthe request of the author, was amended, altered, added, or removed at\r\nthe will of his superiors, which was again subjected here to the same\r\nexamination, agreeably to orders from Rome, and which finally was\r\nlicensed both there and here, and here printed and published, should now\r\nbecome an object of suspicion at the end of two years, and the author\r\nand printer be prohibited from publishing any more.\"—In the sequel is\r\nintimated Ferdinand's desire that the charges, of whatever nature they\r\nmight be, either against Galileo or his book, might be reduced to\r\nwriting and forwarded to Florence, that he might prepare for his\r\njustification; but this reasonable demand was utterly disregarded. It\r\nappears to have been owing to the mean subserviency of Cioli to the\r\ncourt of Rome, that Ferdinand refrained from interfering more\r\nstrenuously to protect Galileo. Cioli's words are: \"The Grand Duke is so\r\nenraged with this business of Galileo, that I do not know what will be\r\ndone. I know, at least, that His Holiness shall have no reason to\r\ncomplain of his ministers, or of their bad advice.\"[81]\r\n\r\nA letter from Galileo's Venetian friend Micanzio, dated about a month\r\nlater, is in rather a bolder and less formal style:—\"The efforts of\r\nyour enemies to get your book prohibited will occasion no loss either to\r\nyour reputation, or to the intelligent part of the world. As to\r\nposterity, this is just one of the surest ways to hand the book down to\r\nthem. But what a wretched set this must be to whom every good thing, and\r\nall that is founded in nature, necessarily appears hostile and odious!\r\nThe world is not restricted to a single corner; you will see the book\r\nprinted in more places and languages than one; and just for this reason,\r\nI wish they would prohibit all good books. My disgust arises from seeing\r\nmyself deprived of what I most desire of this sort, I mean your other\r\ndialogues; and if, from this cause, I fail in having the pleasure of\r\nseeing them, I shall devote to a hundred thousand devils these unnatural\r\nand godless hypocrites.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Thomas Campanella, a monk, who had already\r\ndistinguished himself by an apology for Galileo (published in 1622),\r\nwrote to him from Rome:—\"I learn with the greatest disgust, that a\r\ncongregation of angry theologians is forming to condemn your Dialogues,\r\nand that no single member of it has any knowledge of mathematics, or\r\nfamiliarity with abstruse speculations. I should advise you to procure a\r\nrequest from the Grand Duke that, among the Dominicans and Jesuits and\r\nTheatins, and secular priests whom they are putting on this congregation\r\nagainst your book, they should admit also Castelli and myself.\" It\r\nappears, from subsequent letters both from Campanella and Castelli, that\r\nthe required letter was procured and sent to Rome, but it was not\r\nthought prudent to irritate the opposite party by a request which it was\r\nthen clearly seen would have been made in vain. Not only were these\r\nfriends of Galileo not admitted to the congregation, but, upon some\r\npretext, Castelli was even sent away from Rome, as if Galileo's enemies\r\ndesired to have as few enlightened witnesses as possible of their\r\nproceedings; and on the contrary, Scipio Chiaramonte, who had been long\r\nknown for one of the staunchest and most bigoted defenders of the old\r\nsystem, and who, as Montucla says, seems to have spent a long life in\r\nnothing but retarding, as far as he was able, the progress of discovery,\r\nwas summoned from Pisa to complete their number. From this period we\r\nhave a tolerably continuous account of the proceedings against Galileo\r\nin the dispatches which Nicolini sent regularly to his court. It appears\r\nfrom them that Nicolini had several interviews with the Pope, whom he\r\nfound highly incensed against Galileo, and in one of the earliest he\r\nreceived an intimation to advise the Duke \"not to engage himself in this\r\nmatter as he had done in the other business of Alidosi,[82] because he\r\nwould not get through it with honour.\" Finding Urban in this humour,\r\nNicolini thought it best to temporize, and to avoid the appearance of\r\nany thing like direct opposition. On the 15th of September, probably as\r\nsoon as the first report on Galileo's book had been made, Nicolini\r\nreceived a private notice from the Pope, \"in especial token of the\r\nesteem in which he held the Grand Duke,\" that he was unable to do less\r\nthan consign the work to the consideration of the Inquisition. Nicolini\r\nwas permitted to communicate this to the Grand Duke only, and both were\r\ndeclared liable to \"the usual censures\" of the Inquisition in case of\r\ndivulging the secret.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to summon Galileo to Rome, and the only answer\r\nreturned to all Nicolini's representations of his advanced age of\r\nseventy years, the very infirm state of his health, and the discomforts\r\nwhich he must necessarily suffer in such a journey, and in keeping\r\nquarantine, was that he might come at leisure, and that the quarantine\r\nshould be relaxed as much as possible in his favour, but that it was\r\nindispensably necessary that he should be personally examined before the\r\nInquisition at Rome. Accordingly, on the 14th of February, 1633,\r\nNicolini announces Galileo's arrival, and that he had officially\r\nnotified his presence to the Assessor and Commissary of the Holy Office.\r\nCardinal Barberino, Urban's nephew, who seems on the whole to have acted\r\na friendly part towards Galileo, intimated to him that his most prudent\r\ncourse would be to keep himself as much at home and as quiet as\r\npossible, and to refuse to see any but his most intimate friends. With\r\nthis advice, which was repeated to him from several quarters, Galileo\r\nthought it best to comply, and kept himself entirely secluded in\r\nNicolini's palace, where he was as usual maintained at the expense of\r\nthe Grand Duke. Nelli quotes two letters, which passed between\r\nFerdinand's minister Cioli and Nicolini, in which the former intimated\r\nthat Galileo's expenses were to be defrayed only during the first month\r\nof his residence at Rome. Nicolini returned a spirited answer, that in\r\nthat case, after the time specified, he should continue to treat him as\r\nbefore at his own private cost.\r\n\r\nThe permission to reside at the ambassador's palace whilst his cause was\r\npending, was granted and received as an extraordinary indulgence on the\r\npart of the Inquisition, and indeed if we estimate the proceedings\r\nthroughout against Galileo by the usual practice of that detestable\r\ntribunal, it will appear that he was treated with unusual consideration.\r\nEven when it became necessary in the course of the inquiry to examine\r\nhim in person, which was in the beginning of April, although his removal\r\nto the Holy Office was then insisted upon, yet he was not committed to\r\nclose or strictly solitary confinement. On the contrary, he was\r\nhonourably lodged in the apartments of the Fiscal of the Inquisition,\r\nwhere he was allowed the attendance of his own servant, who was also\r\npermitted to sleep in an adjoining room, and to come and go at pleasure.\r\nHis table was still furnished by Nicolini. But, notwithstanding the\r\ndistinction with which he was thus treated, Galileo was annoyed and\r\nuneasy at being (though little more than nominally) within the walls of\r\nthe Inquisition. He became exceedingly anxious that the matter should be\r\nbrought to a conclusion, and a severe attack of his constitutional\r\ncomplaints rendered him still more fretful and impatient. On the last\r\nday of April, about ten days after his first examination, he was\r\nunexpectedly permitted to return to Nicolini's house, although the\r\nproceedings were yet far from being brought to a conclusion. Nicolini\r\nattributes this favour to Cardinal Barberino, who, he says, liberated\r\nGalileo on his own responsibility, in consideration of the enfeebled\r\nstate of his health.\r\n\r\nIn the society of Nicolini and his family, Galileo recovered something\r\nof his courage and ordinary cheerfulness, although his return appears to\r\nhave been permitted on express condition of a strict seclusion; for at\r\nthe latter end of May, Nicolini was obliged to apply for permission that\r\nGalileo should take that exercise in the open air which was necessary\r\nfor his health; on which occasion he was permitted to go into the public\r\ngardens in a half-closed carriage.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 20th of June, rather more than four months after\r\nGalileo's arrival in Rome, he was again summoned to the Holy Office,\r\nwhither he went the following morning; he was detained there during the\r\nwhole of that day, and on the next day was conducted in a penitential\r\ndress[83] to the Convent of Minerva, where the Cardinals and Prelates,\r\nhis judges, were assembled for the purpose of passing judgment upon him,\r\nby which this venerable old man was solemnly called upon to renounce and\r\nabjure, as impious and heretical, the opinions which his whole existence\r\nhad been consecrated to form and strengthen. As we are not aware that\r\nthis remarkable record of intolerance and bigoted folly has ever been\r\nprinted entire in English, we subjoin a literal translation of the whole\r\nsentence and abjuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sentence of the Inquisition on Galileo._\r\n\r\n    \"We, the undersigned, by the Grace of God, Cardinals of the Holy\r\n    Roman Church, Inquisitors General throughout the whole Christian\r\n    Republic, Special Deputies of the Holy Apostolical Chair against\r\n    heretical depravity,\r\n\r\n    \"Whereas you, Galileo, son of the late Vincenzo Galilei of Florence,\r\n    aged seventy years, were denounced in 1615 to this Holy Office, for\r\n    holding as true a false doctrine taught by many, namely, that the\r\n    sun is immoveable in the centre of the world, and that the earth\r\n    moves, and also with a diurnal motion; also, for having pupils whom\r\n    you instructed in the same opinions; also, for maintaining a\r\n    correspondence on the same with some German mathematicians; also for\r\n    publishing certain letters on the solar spots, in which you\r\n    developed the same doctrine as true; also, for answering the\r\n    objections which were continually produced from the Holy Scriptures,\r\n    by glozing the said Scriptures according to your own meaning; and\r\n    whereas thereupon was produced the copy of a writing, in form of a\r\n    letter, professedly written by you to a person formerly your pupil,\r\n    in which, following the hypotheses of Copernicus, you include\r\n    several propositions contrary to the true sense and authority of the\r\n    Holy Scripture: therefore this holy tribunal being desirous of\r\n    providing against the disorder and mischief which was thence\r\n    proceeding and increasing to the detriment of the holy faith, by the\r\n    desire of His Holiness, and of the Most Eminent Lords Cardinals of\r\n    this supreme and universal Inquisition, the two propositions of the\r\n    stability of the sun, and motion of the earth, were _qualified_ by\r\n    the _Theological Qualifiers_ as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"_1st. The proposition that the Sun is in the centre of the world\r\n    and immoveable from its place, is absurd, philosophically false, and\r\n    formally heretical; because it is expressly contrary to the Holy\r\n    Scripture._\r\n\r\n    \"_2dly. The proposition that the Earth is not the centre of the\r\n    world, nor immoveable, but that it moves, and also with a diurnal\r\n    motion, is also absurd, philosophically false, and, theologically\r\n    considered, at least erroneous in faith._\r\n\r\n    \"But whereas being pleased at that time to deal mildly with you, it\r\n    was decreed in the Holy Congregation, held before His Holiness on\r\n    the 25th day of February, 1616, that His Eminence the Lord Cardinal\r\n    Bellarmine should enjoin you to give up altogether the said false\r\n    doctrine; if you should refuse, that you should be ordered by the\r\n    Commissary of the Holy Office to relinquish it, not to teach it to\r\n    others, nor to defend it, nor ever mention it, and in default of\r\n    acquiescence that you should be imprisoned; and in execution of this\r\n    decree, on the following day at the palace, in presence of His\r\n    Eminence the said Lord Cardinal Bellarmine, after you had been\r\n    mildly admonished by the said Lord Cardinal, you were commanded by\r\n    the acting Commissary of the Holy Office, before a notary and\r\n    witnesses, to relinquish altogether the said false opinion, and in\r\n    future neither to defend nor teach it in any manner, neither\r\n    verbally nor in writing, and upon your promising obedience you were\r\n    dismissed.\r\n\r\n    \"And in order that so pernicious a doctrine might be altogether\r\n    rooted out, nor insinuate itself farther to the heavy detriment of\r\n    the Catholic truth, a decree emanated from the Holy Congregation of\r\n    the Index[84] prohibiting the books which treat of this doctrine;\r\n    and it was declared false, and altogether contrary to the Holy and\r\n    Divine Scripture.\r\n\r\n    \"And whereas a book has since appeared, published at Florence last\r\n    year, the title of which shewed that you were the author, which\r\n    title is: _The Dialogue of Galileo Galilei, on the two principal\r\n    systems of the world, the Ptolemaic and Copernican_; and whereas the\r\n    Holy Congregation has heard that, in consequence of the printing of\r\n    the said book, the false opinion of the earth's motion and stability\r\n    of the sun is daily gaining ground; the said book has been taken\r\n    into careful consideration, and in it has been detected a glaring\r\n    violation of the said order, which had been intimated to you;\r\n    inasmuch as in this book you have defended the said opinion,\r\n    already and in your presence condemned; although in the said book\r\n    you labour with many circumlocutions to induce the belief that it is\r\n    left by you undecided, and in express terms probable: which is\r\n    equally a very grave error, since an opinion can in no way be\r\n    probable which has been already declared and finally determined\r\n    contrary to the divine Scripture. Therefore by Our order you have\r\n    been cited to this Holy Office, where, on your examination upon\r\n    oath, you have acknowledged the said book as written and printed by\r\n    you. You also confessed that you began to write the said book ten or\r\n    twelve years ago, after the order aforesaid had been given. Also,\r\n    that you demanded license to publish it, but without signifying to\r\n    those who granted you this permission that you had been commanded\r\n    not to hold, defend, or teach the said doctrine in any manner. You\r\n    also confessed that the style of the said book was, in many places,\r\n    so composed that the reader might think the arguments adduced on the\r\n    false side to be so worded as more effectually to entangle the\r\n    understanding than to be easily solved, alleging in excuse, that you\r\n    have thus run into an error, foreign (as you say) to your intention,\r\n    from writing in the form of a dialogue, and in consequence of the\r\n    natural complacency which every one feels with regard to his own\r\n    subtilties, and in showing himself more skilful than the generality\r\n    of mankind in contriving, even in favour of false propositions,\r\n    ingenious and apparently probable arguments.\r\n\r\n    \"And, upon a convenient time being given to you for making your\r\n    defence, you produced a certificate in the hand-writing of His\r\n    Eminence the Lord Cardinal Bellarmine, procured, as you said, by\r\n    yourself, that you might defend yourself against the calumnies of\r\n    your enemies, who reported that you had abjured your opinions, and\r\n    had been punished by the Holy Office; in which certificate it is\r\n    declared, that you had not abjured, nor had been punished, but\r\n    merely that the declaration made by His Holiness, and promulgated by\r\n    the Holy Congregation of the Index, had been announced to you, which\r\n    declares that the opinion of the motion of the earth, and stability\r\n    of the sun, is contrary to the Holy Scriptures, and, therefore,\r\n    cannot be held or defended. Wherefore, since no mention is there\r\n    made of two articles of the order, to wit, the order 'not to teach,'\r\n    and 'in any manner,' you argued that we ought to believe that, in\r\n    the lapse of fourteen or sixteen years, they had escaped your\r\n    memory, and that this was also the reason why you were silent as to\r\n    the order, when you sought permission to publish your book, and that\r\n    this is said by you not to excuse your error, but that it may be\r\n    attributed to vain-glorious ambition, rather than to malice. But\r\n    this very certificate, produced on your behalf, has greatly\r\n    aggravated your offence, since it is therein declared that the said\r\n    opinion is contrary to the Holy Scripture, and yet you have dared to\r\n    treat of it, to defend it, and to argue that it is probable; nor is\r\n    there any extenuation in the licence artfully and cunningly extorted\r\n    by you, since you did not intimate the command imposed upon you. But\r\n    whereas it appeared to Us that you had not disclosed the whole truth\r\n    with regard to your intentions, We thought it necessary to proceed\r\n    to the rigorous examination of you, in which (without any prejudice\r\n    to what you had confessed, and which is above detailed against you,\r\n    with regard to your said intention) you answered like a good\r\n    Catholic.\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, having seen and maturely considered the merits of your\r\n    cause, with your said confessions and excuses, and every thing else\r\n    which ought to be seen and considered, We have come to the\r\n    underwritten final sentence against you.\r\n\r\n    \"Invoking, therefore, the most holy name of Our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\n    and of His Most Glorious Virgin Mother Mary, by this Our final\r\n    sentence, which, sitting in council and judgment for the tribunal of\r\n    the Reverend Masters of Sacred Theology, and Doctors of both Laws,\r\n    Our Assessors, We put forth in this writing touching the matters and\r\n    controversies before Us, between The Magnificent Charles Sincerus,\r\n    Doctor of both Laws, Fiscal Proctor of this Holy Office of the one\r\n    part, and you, Galileo Galilei, an examined and confessed criminal\r\n    from this present writing now in progress as above of the other\r\n    part, We pronounce, judge, and declare, that you, the said Galileo,\r\n    by reason of these things which have been detailed in the course of\r\n    this writing, and which, as above, you have confessed, have rendered\r\n    yourself vehemently suspected by this Holy Office of heresy: that is\r\n    to say, that you believe and hold the false doctrine, and contrary\r\n    to the Holy and Divine Scriptures, namely, that the sun is the\r\n    centre of the world, and that it does not move from east to west,\r\n    and that the earth does move, and is not the centre of the world;\r\n    also that an opinion can be held and supported as probable after it\r\n    has been declared and finally decreed contrary to the Holy\r\n    Scripture, and consequently that you have incurred all the censures\r\n    and penalties enjoined and promulgated in the sacred canons, and\r\n    other general and particular constitutions against delinquents of\r\n    this description. From which it is Our pleasure that you be\r\n    absolved, provided that, first, with a sincere heart and unfeigned\r\n    faith, in Our presence, you abjure, curse, and detest the said\r\n    errors and heresies, and every other error and heresy contrary to\r\n    the Catholic and Apostolic Church of Rome, in the form now shown to\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n    \"But, that your grievous and pernicious error and transgression may\r\n    not go altogether unpunished, and that you may be made more cautious\r\n    in future, and may be a warning to others to abstain from\r\n    delinquencies of this sort, We decree that the book of the dialogues\r\n    of Galileo Galilei be prohibited by a public edict, and We condemn\r\n    you to the formal prison of this Holy Office for a period\r\n    determinable at Our pleasure; and, by way of salutary penance, We\r\n    order you, during the next three years, to recite once a week the\r\n    seven penitential psalms, reserving to Ourselves the power of\r\n    moderating, commuting, or taking off the whole or part of the said\r\n    punishment and penance.\r\n\r\n    \"And so We say, pronounce, and by Our sentence declare, decree, and\r\n    reserve, in this and in every other better form and manner, which\r\n    lawfully We may and can use.\r\n\r\n    \"So We, the subscribing Cardinals, pronounce.\r\n\r\n    Felix, Cardinal di Ascoli,\r\n    Guido, Cardinal Bentivoglio,\r\n    Desiderio, Cardinal di Cremona,\r\n    Antonio, Cardinal S. Onofrio,\r\n    Berlingero, Cardinal Gessi,\r\n    Fabricio, Cardinal Verospi,\r\n    Martino, Cardinal Ginetti.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot suppose that Galileo, even broken down as he was with age and\r\ninfirmities, and overawed by the merciless tribunal to whose power he\r\nwas subjected, could without extreme reluctance thus formally give the\r\nlie to his whole life, and call upon God to witness his renunciation of\r\nthe opinions which even his bigoted judges must have felt that he still\r\nclung to in his heart.\r\n\r\nWe know indeed that his friends were unanimous in recommending an\r\nunqualified acquiescence in whatever might be required, but some persons\r\nhave not been able to find an adequate explanation of his submission,\r\neither in their exhortations, or in the mere dread of the alternative\r\nwhich might await him in case of non-compliance. It has in short been\r\nsupposed, although the suspicion scarcely rests upon grounds\r\nsufficiently strong to warrant the assertion, that Galileo did not\r\nsubmit to this abjuration until forced to it, not merely by the\r\napprehension, but by the actual experience of personal violence. The\r\narguments on which this horrible idea appears to be mainly founded are\r\nthe two following: First, the Inquisitors declare in their sentence\r\nthat, not satisfied with Galileo's first confession, they judged it\r\nnecessary to proceed \"to the rigorous examination of him, in which he\r\nanswered like a good Catholic.\"[85] It is pretended by those who are\r\nmore familiar with inquisitorial language than we can profess to be,\r\nthat the words _il rigoroso esame_, form the official phrase for the\r\napplication of the torture, and accordingly they interpret this passage\r\nto mean, that the desired answers and submission had thus been extorted\r\nfrom Galileo, which his judges had otherwise failed to get from him.\r\nAnd, secondly, the partisans of this opinion bring forward in\r\ncorroboration of it, that Galileo immediately on his departure from\r\nRome, in addition to his old complaints, was found to be afflicted with\r\nhernia, and this was a common consequence of the torture of the cord,\r\nwhich they suppose to have been inflicted. It is right to mention that\r\nno other trace can be found of this supposed torturing in all the\r\ndocuments relative to the proceedings against Galileo, at least Venturi\r\nwas so assured by one who had inspected the originals at Paris.[86]\r\n\r\nAlthough the arguments we have mentioned appear to us slight, yet\r\nneither can we attach much importance to the contrast which the\r\nfavourers of the opposite opinion profess to consider so incredible\r\nbetween the honourable manner in which Galileo was treated throughout\r\nthe rest of the inquiry, and the suspected harsh proceeding against him.\r\nWhether Galileo should be lodged in a prison or a palace, was a matter\r\nof far other importance to the Inquisitors and to their hold upon public\r\nopinion, than the question whether or not he should be suffered to\r\nexhibit a persevering resistance to the censures which they were\r\nprepared to cast upon him. Nor need we shrink from the idea, as we might\r\nfrom suspecting of some gross crime, on trivial grounds, one of hitherto\r\nunblemished innocence and character. The question may be disencumbered\r\nof all such scruples, since one atrocity more or less can do little\r\ntowards affecting our judgment of the unholy Office of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nDelambre, who could find so much to reprehend in Galileo's former\r\nuncompromising boldness, is deeply penetrated with the insincerity of\r\nhis behaviour on the present occasion. He seems to have forgotten that a\r\ntribunal which finds it convenient to carry on its inquiries in secret,\r\nis always liable to the suspicion of putting words into the mouth of its\r\nvictims; and if it were worth while, there is sufficient internal\r\nevidence that the language which Galileo is made to hold in his defence\r\nand confession, is rather to be read as the composition of his judges\r\nthan his own. For instance, in one of the letters which we have\r\nextracted[87], it may be seen that this obnoxious work was already in\r\nforward preparation as early as 1610, and yet he is made to confess, and\r\nthe circumstance appears to be brought forward in aggravation of his\r\nguilt, that he began to write it after the prohibition which he had\r\nreceived in 1616.\r\n\r\nThe abjuration was drawn up in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n    _The Abjuration of Galileo._\r\n\r\n    \"I Galileo Galilei, son of the late Vincenzo Galilei, of Florence,\r\n    aged 70 years, being brought personally to judgment, and kneeling\r\n    before you, Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lords Cardinals, General\r\n    Inquisitors of the universal Christian republic against heretical\r\n    depravity, having before my eyes the Holy Gospels, which I touch\r\n    with my own hands, swear, that I have always believed, and now\r\n    believe, and with the help of God will in future believe, every\r\n    article which the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of Rome holds,\r\n    teaches, and preaches. But because I had been enjoined by this Holy\r\n    Office altogether to abandon the false opinion which maintains that\r\n    the sun is the centre and immoveable, and forbidden to hold, defend,\r\n    or teach, the said false doctrine in any manner, and after it had\r\n    been signified to me that the said doctrine is repugnant with the\r\n    Holy Scripture, I have written and printed a book, in which I treat\r\n    of the same doctrine now condemned, and adduce reasons with great\r\n    force in support of the same, without giving any solution, and\r\n    therefore have been judged grievously suspected of heresy; that is\r\n    to say, that I held and believed that the sun is the centre of the\r\n    world and immoveable, and that the earth is not the centre and\r\n    moveable. Willing, therefore, to remove from the minds of Your\r\n    Eminences, and of every Catholic Christian, this vehement suspicion\r\n    rightfully entertained towards me, with a sincere heart and\r\n    unfeigned faith, I abjure, curse, and detest, the said errors and\r\n    heresies, and generally every other error and sect contrary to the\r\n    said Holy Church; and I swear, that I will never more in future say\r\n    or assert anything verbally, or in writing, which may give rise to a\r\n    similar suspicion of me: but if I shall know any heretic, or any one\r\n    suspected of heresy, that I will denounce him to this Holy Office,\r\n    or to the Inquisitor and Ordinary of the place in which I may be. I\r\n    swear, moreover, and promise, that I will fulfil, and observe fully,\r\n    all the penances which have been, or shall be laid on me by this\r\n    Holy Office. But if it shall happen that I violate any of my said\r\n    promises, oaths, and protestations, (which God avert!) I subject\r\n    myself to all the pains and punishments, which have been decreed and\r\n    promulgated by the sacred canons, and other general and particular\r\n    constitutions, against delinquents of this description. So may God\r\n    help me, and his Holy Gospels, which I touch with my own hands. I,\r\n    the above-named Galileo Galilei, have abjured, sworn, promised, and\r\n    bound myself, as above, and in witness thereof with my own hand have\r\n    subscribed this present writing of my abjuration, which I have\r\n    recited word for word. At Rome in the Convent of Minerva, 22d June,\r\n    1633. I, Galileo Galilei, have abjured as above with my own hand.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that Galileo, as he rose from his knees, stamped on the\r\nground, and whispered to one of his friends, _E pur si muove_—(It does\r\nmove though).\r\n\r\nCopies of Galileo's sentence and abjuration were immediately promulgated\r\nin every direction, and the professors at several universities received\r\ndirections to read them publicly. At Florence this ceremony took place\r\nin the church of Sta. Croce, whither Guiducci, Aggiunti, and all others\r\nwho were known in that city as firm adherents to Galileo's opinions,\r\nwere specially summoned. The triumph of the \"Paper Philosophers\" was so\r\nfar complete, and the alarm occasioned by this proof of their dying\r\npower extended even beyond Italy. \"I have been told,\" writes Descartes\r\nfrom Holland to Mersenne at Paris, \"that Galileo's system was printed in\r\nItaly last year, but that every copy has been burnt at Rome, and himself\r\ncondemned to some sort of penance, which has astonished me so much that\r\nI have almost determined to burn all my papers, or at least never to let\r\nthem be seen by any one. I cannot collect that he, who is an Italian and\r\neven a friend of the Pope, as I understand, has been criminated on any\r\nother account than for having attempted to establish the motion of the\r\nearth. I know that this opinion was formerly censured by some Cardinals,\r\nbut I thought I had since heard, that no objection was now made to its\r\nbeing publicly taught, even at Rome.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of all who felt themselves secured against the\r\napprehension of personal danger could take but one direction, for, as\r\nPascal well expressed it in one of his celebrated letters to the\r\nJesuits—\"It is in vain that you have procured against Galileo a decree\r\nfrom Rome condemning his opinion of the earth's motion. Assuredly, that\r\nwill never prove it to be at rest; and if we have unerring observations\r\nproving that it turns round, not all mankind together can keep it from\r\nturning, nor themselves from turning with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly of doctors of the Sorbonne at Paris narrowly escaped from\r\npassing a similar sentence upon the system of Copernicus. The question\r\nwas laid before them by Richelieu, and it appears that their opinion was\r\nfor a moment in favour of confirming the Roman decree. It is to be\r\nwished that the name had been preserved of one of its members, who, by\r\nhis strong and philosophical representations, saved that celebrated body\r\nfrom this disgrace.\r\n\r\nThose who saw nothing in the punishment of Galileo but passion and\r\nblinded superstition, took occasion to revert to the history of a\r\nsimilar blunder of the Court of Rome in the middle of the eighth\r\ncentury. A Bavarian bishop, named Virgil, eminent both as a man of\r\nletters and politician, had asserted the existence of Antipodes, which\r\nexcited in the ignorant bigots of his time no less alarm than did the\r\nmotion of the earth in the seventeenth century. Pope Zachary, who was\r\nscandalized at the idea of another earth, inhabited by another race of\r\nmen, and enlightened by another sun and moon (for this was the shape\r\nwhich Virgil's system assumed in his eyes), sent out positive orders to\r\nhis legate in Bavaria. \"With regard to Virgil, the philosopher, (I know\r\nnot whether to call him priest,) if he own these perverse opinions,\r\nstrip him of his priesthood, and drive him from the church and altars of\r\nGod.\" But Virgil had himself occasionally acted as legate, and was\r\nmoreover too necessary to his sovereign to be easily displaced. He\r\nutterly disregarded these denunciations, and during twenty-five years\r\nwhich elapsed before his death, retained his opinions, his bishopric of\r\nSalzburg, and his political power. He was afterwards canonized.[88]\r\n\r\nEven the most zealous advocates of the authority of Rome were\r\nembarrassed in endeavouring to justify the treatment which Galileo\r\nexperienced. Tiraboschi has attempted to draw a somewhat subtle\r\ndistinction between the bulls of the Pope and the inquisitorial decrees\r\nwhich were sanctioned and approved by him; he dwells on the reflection\r\nthat no one, even among the most zealous Catholics, has ever claimed\r\ninfallibility as an attribute of the Inquisition, and looks upon it as a\r\nspecial mark of grace accorded to the Roman Catholic Church, that during\r\nthe whole period in which most theologians rejected the opinions of\r\nCopernicus, as contrary to the Scriptures, the head of that Church was\r\nnever permitted to compromise his infallible character by formally\r\ncondemning it.[89]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the value of this consolation, it can hardly be\r\nconceded, unless it be at the same time admitted that many scrupulous\r\nmembers of the Church of Rome have been suffered to remain in singular\r\nmisapprehension of the nature and sanction of the authority to which\r\nGalileo had yielded. The words of the bull of Sixtus V., by which the\r\nCongregation of the Index was remodelled in 1588, are quoted by a\r\nprofessor of the University of Louvain, a zealous antagonist of Galileo,\r\nas follows: \"They are to examine and expose the books which are\r\nrepugnant to the Catholic doctrines and Christian discipline, and after\r\nreporting on them to us, they are to condemn them by our authority.\"[90]\r\nNor does it appear that the learned editors of what is commonly called\r\nthe Jesuit's edition of Newton's \"Principia\" were of opinion, that in\r\nadopting the Copernican system they should transgress a mandate\r\nemanating from any thing short of infallible wisdom. The remarkable\r\nwords which they were compelled to prefix to their book, show how\r\nsensitive the court of Rome remained, even so late as 1742, with regard\r\nto this rashly condemned theory. In their preface they say: \"Newton in\r\nthis third book supposes the motion of the earth. We could not explain\r\nthe author's propositions otherwise than by making the same supposition.\r\nWe are therefore forced to sustain a character which is not our own; but\r\nwe profess to pay the obsequious reverence which is due to the decrees\r\npronounced by the supreme Pontiffs against the motion of the earth.\"[91]\r\n\r\nThis coy reluctance to admit what nobody any longer doubts has survived\r\nto the present time; for Bailli informs us,[92] that the utmost\r\nendeavours of Lalande, when at Rome, to obtain that Galileo's work\r\nshould be erased from the Index, were entirely ineffectual, in\r\nconsequence of the decree which had been fulminated against him; and in\r\nfact both it, and the book of Copernicus, \"Nisi Corrigatur,\" are still\r\nto be seen on the forbidden list of 1828.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation of Galileo and his book was not thought sufficient.\r\nUrban's indignation also vented itself upon those who had been\r\ninstrumental in obtaining the licence for him. The Inquisitor at\r\nFlorence was reprimanded; Riccardi, the master of the sacred palace, and\r\nCiampoli, Urban's secretary, were both dismissed from their situations.\r\nTheir punishment appears rather anomalous and inconsistent with the\r\nproceedings against Galileo, in which it was assumed that his book was\r\nnot properly licensed; yet the others suffered on account of granting\r\nthat very licence, which he was accused of having surreptitiously\r\nobtained from them, by concealing circumstances with which they were not\r\nbound to be otherwise acquainted. Riccardi, in exculpation of his\r\nconduct, produced a letter in the hand-writing of Ciampoli, in which was\r\ncontained that His Holiness, in whose presence the letter professed to\r\nbe written, ordered the licence to be given. Urban only replied that\r\nthis was a Ciampolism; that his secretary and Galileo had circumvented\r\nhim; that he had already dismissed Ciampoli, and that Riccardi must\r\nprepare to follow him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ceremony of abjuration was concluded, Galileo was\r\nconsigned, pursuant to his sentence, to the prison of the Inquisition.\r\nProbably it was never intended that he should long remain there, for at\r\nthe end of four days, he was reconducted on a very slight representation\r\nof Nicolini to the ambassador's palace, there to await his further\r\ndestination. Florence was still suffering under the before-mentioned\r\ncontagion; and Sienna was at last fixed on as the place of his\r\nrelegation. He would have been shut up in some convent in that city, if\r\nNicolini had not recommended as a more suitable residence, the palace of\r\nthe Archbishop Piccolomini, whom he knew to be among Galileo's warmest\r\nfriends. Urban consented to the change, and Galileo finally left Rome\r\nfor Sienna in the early part of July.\r\n\r\nPiccolomini received him with the utmost kindness, controlled of course\r\nby the strict injunctions which were dispatched from Rome, not to suffer\r\nhim on any account to quit the confines of the palace. Galileo continued\r\nat Sienna in this state of seclusion till December of the same year,\r\nwhen the contagion having ceased in Tuscany, he applied for permission\r\nto return to his villa at Arcetri. This was allowed, subject to the same\r\nrestrictions under which he had been residing with the archbishop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] Delambre quotes this sentence from a passage which is so obviously\r\nironical throughout, as an instance of Galileo's mis-statement of\r\nfacts!—_Hist. de l'Astr.

This list, in the early periods of the Reformation, was\r\noften consulted by the curious, who were enlarging their libraries; and\r\na story is current in England, that, to prevent this mischief, the Index\r\nitself was inserted in its own forbidden catalogue. The origin of this\r\nstory is, that an Index was published in Spain, particularizing the\r\nobjectionable passages in such books as were only partially condemned;\r\nand although compiled with the best intentions, this was found to be so\r\nracy, that it became necessary to forbid the circulation of this edition\r\nin subsequent lists.\r\n\r\n[85] Giudicassimo esser necessario venir contro di te al rigoroso esame\r\nnel quale rispondesti cattolicamente.\r\n\r\n[86] The fate of these documents is curious; after being long preserved\r\nat Rome, they were carried away in 1809, by order of Buonaparte, to\r\nParis, where they remained till his first abdication.

It has been mentioned, that he is considered to surpass all\r\nother Italian writers (unless we except Machiavelli) in the purity and\r\nbeauty of his language, and indeed his principal followers, who avowedly\r\nimitated his style, make a distinguished group among the classical\r\nauthors of modern Italy. He professed to have formed himself from the\r\nstudy of Ariosto, whose poems he passionately admired, insomuch that he\r\ncould repeat the greater part of them, as well as those of Berni and\r\nPetrarca, all which he was in the frequent habit of quoting in\r\nconversation. The fashion and almost universal practice of that day was\r\nto write on philosophical subjects in Latin; and although Galileo wrote\r\nvery passably in that language, yet he generally preferred the use of\r\nItalian, for which he gave his reasons in the following characteristic\r\nmanner:—\r\n\r\n\"I wrote in Italian because I wished every one to be able to read what I\r\nwrote; and for the same cause I have written my last treatise in the\r\nsame language: the reason which has induced me is, that I see young men\r\nbrought together indiscriminately to study to become physicians,\r\nphilosophers, &c., and whilst many apply to such professions who are\r\nmost unfit for them, others who would be competent remain occupied\r\neither with domestic business, or with other employments alien to\r\nliterature; who, although furnished, as Ruzzante might say, with a\r\n_decent set of brains_, yet, not being able to understand things written\r\nin _gibberish_, take it into their heads, that in these crabbed folios\r\nthere must be some grand _hocus pocus_ of logic and philosophy much too\r\nhigh up for them to think of jumping at. I want them to know, that as\r\nNature has given eyes to them just as well as to philosophers for the\r\npurpose of seeing her works, she has also given them brains for\r\nexamining and understanding them.\"\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the dialogues has been already described;[93]\r\nwe shall therefore premise no more than the judgment pronounced on them\r\nby a highly gifted writer, to supply the deficiencies of our necessarily\r\nimperfect analysis.\r\n\r\n\"One forms a very imperfect idea of Galileo, from considering the\r\ndiscoveries and inventions, numerous and splendid as they are, of which\r\nhe was the undisputed author. It is by following his reasonings, and by\r\npursuing the train of his thoughts, in his own elegant, though somewhat\r\ndiffuse exposition of them, that we become acquainted with the fertility\r\nof his genius—with the sagacity, penetration, and comprehensiveness of\r\nhis mind. The service which he rendered to real knowledge is to be\r\nestimated, not only from the truths which he discovered, but from the\r\nerrors which he detected—not merely from the sound principles which he\r\nestablished, but from the pernicious idols which he overthrew. The\r\ndialogues on the system are written with such singular felicity, that\r\none reads them at the present day, when the truths contained in them are\r\nknown and admitted, with all the delight of novelty, and feels one's\r\nself carried back to the period when the telescope was first directed to\r\nthe heavens, and when the earth's motion, with all its train of\r\nconsequences, was proved for the first time.\"[94]\r\n\r\nThe first Dialogue is opened by an attack upon the arguments by which\r\nAristotle pretended to determine _à priori_ the necessary motions\r\nbelonging to different parts of the world, and on his favourite\r\nprinciple that particular motions belong naturally to particular\r\nsubstances. Salviati (representing Galileo) then objects to the\r\nAristotelian distinctions between the corruptible elements and\r\nincorruptible skies, instancing among other things the solar spots and\r\nnewly appearing stars, as arguments that the other heavenly bodies may\r\nprobably be subjected to changes similar to those which are continually\r\noccurring on the earth, and that it is the great distance alone which\r\nprevents their being observed. After a long discussion on this point,\r\nSagredo exclaims, \"I see into the heart of Simplicio, and perceive that\r\nhe is much moved by the force of these too conclusive arguments; but\r\nmethinks I hear him say—'Oh, to whom must we betake ourselves to settle\r\nour disputes if Aristotle be removed from the chair? What other author\r\nhave we to follow in our schools, our studies, and academies? What\r\nphilosopher has written on all the parts of Natural Philosophy, and so\r\nmethodically as not to have overlooked a single conclusion? Must we then\r\ndesolate this fabric, by which so many travellers have been sheltered?\r\nMust we destroy this asylum, this Prytaneum wherein so many students\r\nhave found a convenient resting-place, where without being exposed to\r\nthe injuries of the weather, one may acquire an intimate knowledge of\r\nnature, merely by turning over a few leaves? Shall we level this\r\nbulwark, behind which we are safe from every hostile attack?' I pity him\r\nno less than I do one who at great expense of time and treasure, and\r\nwith the labour of hundreds, has built up a very noble palace; and then,\r\nbecause of insecure foundations, sees it ready to fall—unable to bear\r\nthat those walls be stripped that are adorned with so many beautiful\r\npictures, or to suffer those columns to fall that uphold the stately\r\ngalleries, or to see ruined the gilded roofs, the chimney-pieces, the\r\nfriezes, and marble cornices erected at so much cost, he goes about it\r\nwith girders and props, with shores and buttresses, to hinder its\r\ndestruction.\"\r\n\r\nSalviati proceeds to point out the many points of similarity between the\r\nearth and moon, and among others which we have already mentioned, the\r\nfollowing remark deserves especial notice:—\r\n\r\n\"Just as from the mutual and universal tendency of the parts of the\r\nearth to form a whole, it follows that they all meet together with equal\r\ninclination, and that they may unite as closely as possible, assume the\r\nspherical form; why ought we not to believe that the moon, the sun, and\r\nother mundane bodies are also of a round figure, from no other reason\r\nthan from a common instinct and natural concourse of all their component\r\nparts; of which if by accident any one should be violently separated\r\nfrom its whole, is it not reasonable to believe that spontaneously, and\r\nof its natural instinct, it would return? It may be added that if any\r\ncentre of the universe may be assigned, to which the whole terrene globe\r\nif thence removed would seek to return, we shall find most probable that\r\nthe sun is placed in it, as by the sequel you shall understand.\"\r\n\r\nMany who are but superficially acquainted with the History of Astronomy,\r\nare apt to suppose that Newton's great merit was in his being the first\r\nto suppose an attractive force existing in and between the different\r\nbodies composing the solar system. This idea is very erroneous; Newton's\r\ndiscovery consisted in conceiving and proving the identity of the force\r\nwith which a stone falls, and that by which the moon falls, towards the\r\nearth (on an assumption that this force becomes weaker in a certain\r\nproportion as the distance increases at which it operates), and in\r\ngeneralizing this idea, in applying it to all the visible creation, and\r\ntracing the principle of universal gravitation with the assistance of a\r\nmost refined and beautiful geometry into many of its most remote\r\nconsequences. But the general notion of an attractive force between the\r\nsun, moon, and planets, was very commonly entertained before Newton was\r\nborn, and may be traced back to Kepler, who was probably the first\r\nmodern philosopher who suggested it. The following extraordinary\r\npassages from his \"Astronomy\" will shew the nature of his conceptions on\r\nthis subject:—\r\n\r\n\"The true doctrine of gravity is founded on these axioms: every\r\ncorporeal substance, so far forth as it is corporeal, has a natural\r\nfitness for resting in every place where it may be situated by itself\r\nbeyond the sphere of influence of its cognate body. Gravity is a mutual\r\naffection between cognate bodies towards union or conjunction (similar\r\nin kind to the magnetic virtue), so that the earth attracts a stone much\r\nrather than the stone seeks the earth. Heavy bodies (if in the first\r\nplace we put the earth in the centre of the world) are not carried to\r\nthe centre of the world in its quality of centre of the world, but as to\r\nthe centre of a cognate round body, namely the earth. So that\r\nwheresoever the earth may be placed or whithersoever it may be carried\r\nby its animal faculty, heavy bodies will always be carried towards it.\r\nIf the earth were not round heavy bodies would not tend from every side\r\nin a straight line towards the centre of the earth, but to different\r\npoints from different sides. If two stones were placed in any part of\r\nthe world near each other and beyond the sphere of influence of a third\r\ncognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come\r\ntogether in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a\r\nspace proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon\r\nand earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or\r\nsome other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a\r\nfifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth\r\nthrough the other fifty-three parts, and would there meet, assuming\r\nhowever that the substance of both is of the same density. If the earth\r\nshould cease to attract its waters to itself, all the waters of the sea\r\nwould be raised, and would flow to the body of the moon.\"[95]\r\n\r\nHe also conjectured that the irregularities in the moon's motion were\r\ncaused by the joint action of the sun and earth, and recognized the\r\nmutual action of the sun and planets, when he declared the mass and\r\ndensity of the sun to be so great that the united attraction of the\r\nother planets cannot remove it from its place. Among these bold and\r\nbrilliant ideas, his temperament led him to introduce others which show\r\nhow unsafe it was to follow his guidance, and which account for, if they\r\ndo not altogether justify, the sarcastic remark of Ross, that \"Kepler's\r\nopinion that the planets are moved round by the sunne, and that this is\r\ndone by sending forth a magnetic virtue, and that the sun-beames are\r\nlike the teethe of a wheele taking hold of the planets, are senslesse\r\ncrotchets fitter for a wheeler or a miller than a philosopher.\"[96]\r\nRoberval took up Kepler's notions, especially in the tract which he\r\nfalsely attributed to Aristarchus, and it is much to be regretted that\r\nRoberval should deserve credit for anything connected with that impudent\r\nfraud. The principle of universal gravitation, though not the varying\r\nproportion, is distinctly assumed in it, as the following passages will\r\nsufficiently prove: \"In every single particle of the earth, and the\r\nterrestrial elements, is a certain property or accident which we suppose\r\ncommon to the whole system of the world, by virtue of which all its\r\nparts are forced together, and reciprocally attract each other; and this\r\nproperty is found in a greater or less degree in the different\r\nparticles, according to their density. If the earth be considered by\r\nitself, its centres of magnitude and virtue, or gravity, as we usually\r\ncall it, will coincide, to which all its parts tend in a straight line,\r\nas well by their own exertion or gravity, as by the reciprocal\r\nattraction of all the rest.\" In a subsequent chapter, Roberval repeats\r\nthese passages nearly in the same words, applying them to the whole\r\nsolar system, adding, that \"the force of this attraction is not to be\r\nconsidered as residing in the centre itself, as some ignorant people\r\nthink, but in the whole system whose parts are equally disposed round\r\nthe centre.\"[97] This very curious work was reprinted in the third\r\nvolume of the _Reflexiones Physico-Mathematicæ_ of Mersenne, from whom\r\nRoberval pretended to have received the Arabic manuscript, and who is\r\nthus irretrievably implicated in the forgery.[98] The last remark,\r\ndenying the attractive force to be due to any property of the central\r\npoint, seems aimed at Aristotle, who, in a no less curious passage,\r\nmaintaining exactly the opposite opinion, says, \"Hence, we may better\r\nunderstand what the ancients have related, that like things are wont to\r\nhave a tendency to each other. For this is not absolutely true; for if\r\nthe earth were to be removed to the place now occupied by the moon, no\r\npart of the earth would then have a tendency towards that place, but\r\nwould still fall towards the point which the earth's centre now\r\noccupies.\"[99] Mersenne considered the consequences of the attractive\r\nforce of each particle of matter so far as to remark, that if a body\r\nwere supposed to fall towards the centre of the earth, it would be\r\nretarded by the attraction of the part through which it had already\r\nfallen.[100] Galileo had not altogether neglected to speculate on such a\r\nsupposition, as is plain from the following extract. It is taken from a\r\nletter to Carcaville, dated from Arcetri, in 1637. \"I will say farther,\r\nthat I have not absolutely and clearly satisfied myself that a heavy\r\nbody would arrive sooner at the centre of the earth, if it began to fall\r\nfrom the distance only of a single yard, than another which should start\r\nfrom the distance of a thousand miles. I do not affirm this, but I offer\r\nit as a paradox.\"[101]\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to offer any satisfactory comment upon this\r\npassage; it may be sufficient to observe that this paradoxical result\r\nwas afterwards deduced by Newton, as one of the consequences of the\r\ngeneral law with which all nature is pervaded, but with which there is\r\nno reason to believe that Galileo had any acquaintance; indeed the idea\r\nis fully negatived by other passages in this same letter. This is one of\r\nthe many instances from which we may learn to be cautious how we invest\r\ndetached passages of the earlier mathematicians with a meaning which in\r\nmany cases their authors did not contemplate. The progressive\r\ndevelopment of these ideas in the hands of Wallis, Huyghens, Hook, Wren,\r\nand Newton, would lead us too far from our principal subject. There is\r\nanother passage in the third dialogue connected with this subject, which\r\nit may be as well to notice in this place. \"The parts of the earth have\r\nsuch a propensity to its centre, that when it changes its place,\r\nalthough they may be very distant from the globe at the time of the\r\nchange, yet must they follow. An example similar to this is the\r\nperpetual sequence of the Medicean stars, although always separated from\r\nJupiter. The same may be said of the moon, obliged to follow the earth.\r\nAnd this may serve for those simple ones who have difficulty in\r\ncomprehending how these two globes, not being chained together, nor\r\nstrung upon a pole, mutually follow each other, so that on the\r\nacceleration or retardation of the one, the other also moves quicker or\r\nslower.\"\r\n\r\nThe second Dialogue is appropriated chiefly to the discussion of the\r\ndiurnal motion of the earth; and the principal arguments urged by\r\nAristotle, Ptolemy, and others, are successively brought forward and\r\nconfuted. The opposers of the earth's diurnal motion maintained, that if\r\nit were turning round, a stone dropped from the top of a tower would not\r\nfall at its foot; but, by the rotation of the earth to the eastward\r\ncarrying away the tower with it, would be left at a great distance to\r\nthe westward; it was common to compare this effect to a stone dropped\r\nfrom the mast-head of a ship, and without any regard to truth it was\r\nboldly asserted that this would fall considerably nearer the stern than\r\nthe foot of the mast, if the ship were in rapid motion. The same\r\nargument was presented in a variety of forms,—such as that a\r\ncannon-ball shot perpendicularly upwards would not fall at the same\r\nspot; that if fired to the eastward it would fly farther than to the\r\nwestward; that a mark to the east or west would never be hit, because of\r\nthe rising or sinking of the horizon during the flight of the ball; that\r\nladies' ringlets would all stand out to the westward,[102] with other\r\nconceits of the like nature: to which the general reply is given, that\r\nin all these cases the stone, or ball, or other body, participates\r\nequally in the motion of the earth, which, therefore, so far as regards\r\nthe relative motion of its parts, may be disregarded. The manner in\r\nwhich this is illustrated, appears in the following extract from the\r\ndialogue:—\"_Sagredo._ If the nib of a writing pen which was in the ship\r\nduring my voyage direct from Venice to Alexandria, had had the power of\r\nleaving a visible mark of all its path, what trace, what mark, what line\r\nwould it have left?—_Simplicio._ It would have left a line stretched\r\nout thither from Venice not perfectly straight, or to speak more\r\ncorrectly, not perfectly extended in an exact circular arc, but here and\r\nthere more and less curved accordingly as the vessel had pitched more or\r\nless; but this variation in some places of one or two yards to the right\r\nor left, or up or down in a length of many hundred miles, would have\r\noccasioned but slight alteration in the whole course of the line, so\r\nthat it would have been hardly sensible, and without any great error we\r\nmay speak of it as a perfectly circular arc.—_Sagred._ So that the true\r\nand most exact motion of the point of the pen would also have been a\r\nperfect arc of a circle if the motion of the vessel, abstracting from\r\nthe fluctuations of the waves, had been steady and gentle; and if I had\r\nheld this pen constantly in my hand, and had merely moved it an inch or\r\ntwo one way or the other, what alteration would that have made in the\r\ntrue and principal motion?—_Simpl._ Less than that which would be\r\noccasioned in a line a thousand yards long, by varying here and there\r\nfrom perfect straightness by the quantity of a flea's eye.—_Sagred._ If\r\nthen a painter on our quitting the port had begun to draw with this pen\r\non paper, and had continued his drawing till we got to Alexandria, he\r\nwould have been able by its motion, to produce an accurate\r\nrepresentation of many objects perfectly shadowed, and filled up on all\r\nsides with landscapes, buildings, and animals, although all the true,\r\nreal, and essential motion of the point of his pen would have been no\r\nother but a very long and very simple line; and as to the peculiar work\r\nof the painter, he would have drawn it exactly the same if the ship had\r\nstood still. Therefore, of the very protracted motion of the pen, there\r\nremain no other traces than those marks drawn upon the paper, the reason\r\nof this being that the great motion from Venice to Alexandria was common\r\nto the paper, the pen, and everything that was in the ship; but the\r\ntrifling motion forwards and backwards, to the right and left,\r\ncommunicated by the painter's fingers to the pen, and not to the paper,\r\nfrom being peculiar to the pen, left its mark upon the paper, which as\r\nto this motion was immoveable. Thus it is likewise true that in the\r\nsupposition of the earth's rotation, the motion of a falling stone is\r\nreally a long track of many hundreds and thousands of yards; and if it\r\ncould have delineated its course in the calm air, or on any other\r\nsurface, it would have left behind it a very long transversal line; but\r\nthat part of all this motion which is common to the stone, the tower,\r\nand ourselves, is imperceptible by us and the same as if not existing,\r\nand only that part remains to be observed of which neither we nor the\r\ntower partake, which in short is the fall of the stone along the tower.\"\r\n\r\nThe mechanical doctrines introduced into this second dialogue will be\r\nnoticed on another occasion; we shall pass on to other extracts,\r\nillustrative of the general character of Galileo's reasoning:—\r\n\"_Salviati._ I did not say that the earth has no principle, either\r\ninternal or external, of its motion of rotation, but I do say that I\r\nknow not which of the two it has, and that my ignorance has no power to\r\ntake its motion away; but if this author knows by what principle other\r\nmundane bodies, of the motion of which we are certain, are turned round,\r\nI say that what moves the Earth is something like that by which Mars and\r\nJupiter, and, as he believes, the starry sphere, are moved round; and if\r\nhe will satisfy me as to the cause of their motion, I bind myself to be\r\nable to tell him what moves the earth. Nay more; I undertake to do the\r\nsame if he can teach me what it is which moves the parts of the earth\r\ndownwards.—_Simpl._ The cause of this effect is notorious, and every\r\none knows that it is Gravity.—_Salv._ You are out, Master Simplicio;\r\nyou should say that every one knows that it is called Gravity; but I do\r\nnot ask you the name but the nature of the thing, of which nature you do\r\nnot know one tittle more than you know of the nature of the moving cause\r\nof the rotation of the stars, except it be the name which has been given\r\nto the one, and made familiar and domestic, by the frequent experience\r\nwe have of it many thousand times in a day; but of the principle or\r\nvirtue by which a stone falls to the ground, we really know no more than\r\nwe know of the principle which carries it upwards when thrown into the\r\nair, or which carries the moon round its orbit, except, as I have said,\r\nthe name of gravity which we have peculiarly and exclusively assigned to\r\nit; whereas we speak of the other with a more generic term, and talk of\r\nthe virtue impressed, and call it either an assisting or an informing\r\nintelligence, and are content to say that Nature is the cause of an\r\ninfinite number of other motions.\"\r\n\r\nSimplicio is made to quote a passage from Scheiner's book of Conclusions\r\nagainst Copernicus, to the following effect:—\"'If the whole earth and\r\nwater were annihilated, no hail or rain would fall from the clouds, but\r\nwould only be naturally carried round in a circle, nor would any fire or\r\nfiery thing ascend, since, according to the not improbable opinion of\r\nthese others, there is no fire in the upper regions.'—_Salv._ The\r\nforesight of this philosopher is most admirable and praiseworthy, for he\r\nis not content with providing for things that might happen during the\r\ncommon course of nature, but persists in shewing his care for the\r\nconsequences of what he very well knows will never come to pass.\r\nNevertheless, for the sake of hearing some of his notable conceits, I\r\nwill grant that if the earth and water were annihilated there would be\r\nno more hail or rain, nor would fiery matter ascend any more, but would\r\ncontinue a motion of revolution. What is to follow? What conclusion is\r\nthe philosopher going to draw?—_Simpl._ This objection is in the very\r\nnext words—'Which nevertheless (says he) is contrary to experience and\r\nreason.'—_Salv._ Now I must yield: since he has so great an advantage\r\nover me as experience, with which I am quite unprovided. For hitherto I\r\nhave never happened to see the terrestrial earth and water annihilated,\r\nso as to be able to observe what the hail and fire did in the confusion.\r\nBut does he tell us for our information at least what they did?—_Simp._\r\nNo, he does not say any thing more.—_Salv._ I would give something to\r\nhave a word or two with this person, to ask him whether, when this globe\r\nvanished, it also carried away the common centre of gravity, as I fancy\r\nit did, in which case I take it that the hail and water would remain\r\nstupid and confounded amongst the clouds, without knowing what to do\r\nwith themselves.... And lastly, that I may give this philosopher a less\r\nequivocal answer, I tell him that I know as much of what would follow\r\nafter the annihilation of the terrestrial globe, as he could have known\r\nwhat was about to happen in and about it, before it was created.\"\r\n\r\nGreat part of the third Dialogue is taken up with discussions on the\r\nparallax of the new stars of 1572 and 1604, in which Delambre notices\r\nthat Galileo does not employ logarithms in his calculations, although\r\ntheir use had been known since Napier discovered them in 1616: the\r\ndialogue then turns to the annual motion \"first taken from the Sun and\r\nconferred upon the Earth by Aristarchus Samius, and afterwards by\r\nCopernicus.\" Salviati speaks of his contemporary philosophers with great\r\ncontempt—\"If you had ever been worn out as I have been many and many a\r\ntime with hearing what sort of stuff is sufficient to make the obstinate\r\nvulgar unpersuadable, I do not say to agree with, but even to listen to\r\nthese novelties, I believe your wonder at finding so few followers of\r\nthese opinions would greatly fall off. But little regard in my judgment\r\nis to be had of those understandings who are convinced and immoveably\r\npersuaded of the fixedness of the earth, by seeing that they are not\r\nable to breakfast this morning at Constantinople, and sup in the evening\r\nin Japan, and who feel satisfied that the earth, so heavy as it is,\r\ncannot climb up above the sun, and then come tumbling in a breakneck\r\nfashion down again!\"[103] This remark serves to introduce several\r\nspecious arguments against the annual motion of the earth, which are\r\nsuccessively confuted, and it is shewn how readily the apparent stations\r\nand retrogradations of the planets are accounted for on this\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\nThe following is one of the frequently recurring passages in which\r\nGalileo, whilst arguing in favour of the enormous distances at which the\r\ntheory of Copernicus necessarily placed the fixed stars, inveighs\r\nagainst the arrogance with which men pretend to judge of matters removed\r\nabove their comprehension. \"_Simpl._ All this is very well, and it is\r\nnot to be denied that the heavens may surpass in bigness the capacity of\r\nour imaginations, as also that God might have created it yet a thousand\r\ntimes larger than it really is, but we ought not to admit anything to be\r\ncreated in vain, and useless in the universe. Now whilst we see this\r\nbeautiful arrangement of the planets, disposed round the earth at\r\ndistances proportioned to the effects they are to produce on us for our\r\nbenefit, to what purpose should a vast vacancy be afterwards interposed\r\nbetween the orbit of Saturn and the starry spheres, containing not a\r\nsingle star, and altogether useless and unprofitable? to what end? for\r\nwhose use and advantage?—_Salv._ Methinks we arrogate too much to\r\nourselves, Simplicio, when we will have it that the care of us alone is\r\nthe adequate and sufficient work and bound, beyond which the divine\r\nwisdom and power does and disposes of nothing. I feel confident that\r\nnothing is omitted by the Divine Providence of what concerns the\r\ngovernment of human affairs; but that there may not be other things in\r\nthe universe dependant upon His supreme wisdom, I cannot for myself, by\r\nwhat my reason holds out to me, bring myself to believe. So that when I\r\nam told of the uselessness of an immense space interposed between the\r\norbits of the planets and the fixed stars, empty and valueless, I reply\r\nthat there is temerity in attempting by feeble reason to judge the works\r\nof God, and in calling vain and superfluous every part of the universe\r\nwhich is of no use to us.—_Sagr._ Say rather, and I believe you would\r\nsay better, that we have no means of knowing what is of use to us; and I\r\nhold it to be one of the greatest pieces of arrogance and folly that can\r\nbe in this world to say, because I know not of what use Jupiter or\r\nSaturn are to me, that therefore these planets are superfluous; nay\r\nmore, that there are no such things in nature. To understand what effect\r\nis worked upon us by this or that heavenly body (since you will have it\r\nthat all their use must have a reference to us), it would be necessary\r\nto remove it for a while, and then the effect which I find no longer\r\nproduced in me, I may say that it depended upon that star. Besides, who\r\nwill dare say that the space which they call too vast and useless\r\nbetween Saturn and the fixed stars is void of other bodies belonging to\r\nthe universe. Must it be so because we do not see them: then I suppose\r\nthe four Medicean planets, and the companions of Saturn, came into the\r\nheavens when we first began to see them, and not before! and, by the\r\nsame rule, the other innumerable fixed stars did not exist before men\r\nsaw them. The nebulæ were till lately only white flakes, till with the\r\ntelescope we have made of them constellations of bright and beautiful\r\nstars. Oh presumptuous! rather, Oh rash ignorance of man!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a discussion on Gilbert's Theory of Terrestrial Magnetism,\r\nintroduced by the parallelism of the earth's axis, and of which Galileo\r\npraises very highly both the method and results, the dialogue proceeds\r\nas follows:—\"_Simpl._ It appears to me that Sig. Salviati, with a fine\r\ncircumlocution, has so clearly explained the cause of these effects,\r\nthat any common understanding, even though unacquainted with science,\r\nmay comprehend it: but we, confining ourselves to the terms of art,\r\nreduce the cause of these and other similar natural phenomena to\r\nsympathy, which is a certain agreement and mutual appetency arising\r\nbetween things which have the same qualities, just as, on the other\r\nhand, that disagreement and aversion, with which other things naturally\r\nrepel and abhor each other, we style antipathy.—_Sagr._ And thus with\r\nthese two words they are able to give a reason for the great number of\r\neffects and accidents which we see, not without admiration, to be\r\nproduced in Nature. But it strikes me that this mode of philosophising\r\nhas a great sympathy with the style in which one of my friends used to\r\npaint: on one part of the canvas he would write with chalk—there I will\r\nhave a fountain, with Diana and her nymphs; here some harriers; in this\r\ncorner I will have a huntsman, with a stag's head; the rest may be a\r\nlandscape of wood and mountain; and what remains to be done may be put\r\nin by the colourman: and thus he flattered himself that he had painted\r\nthe story of Actæon, having contributed nothing to it beyond the names.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth Dialogue is devoted entirely to an examination of the tides,\r\nand is a development and extension of the treatise already mentioned to\r\nhave been sent to the Archduke Leopold, in 1618.[104] Galileo was\r\nuncommonly partial to his theory of the tides, from which he thought to\r\nderive a direct proof of the earth's motion in her orbit; and although\r\nhis theory was erroneous, it required a farther advance in the science\r\nof motion than had been attained even at a much later period to point\r\nout the insufficiency of it. It is well known that the problem of\r\nexplaining the cause of this alternate motion of the waters had been\r\nconsidered from the earliest ages one of the most difficult that could\r\nbe proposed, and the solutions with which different inquirers were\r\nobliged to rest contented, shew that it long deserved the name given to\r\nit, of \"the grave of human curiosity.\"[105] Riccioli has enumerated\r\nseveral of the opinions which in turn had their favourers and\r\nsupporters. One party supposed the rise of the waters to be occasioned\r\nby the influx of rivers into the sea; others compared the earth to a\r\nlarge animal, of which the tides indicated the respiration; a third\r\ntheory supposed the existence of subterraneous fires, by which the sea\r\nwas periodically made to boil; others attributed the cause of a similar\r\nchange of temperature to the sun and moon.\r\n\r\nThere is an unfounded legend, that Aristotle drowned himself in despair\r\nof being able to invent a plausible explanation of the extraordinary\r\ntides in the Euripus. His curiosity on the subject does not appear to\r\nhave been so acute (judging from his writings) as this story would\r\nimply. In one of his books he merely mentions a rumour, that there are\r\ngreat elevations or swellings of the seas, which recur periodically,\r\naccording to the course of the moon. Lalande, in the fourth volume of\r\nhis Astronomy, has given an interesting account of the opinion of the\r\nconnection of the tides with the moon's motion. Pytheas of Marseilles, a\r\ncontemporary of Aristotle, was the first who has been recorded as\r\nobserving, that the full tides occur at full moon, and the ebbs at new\r\nmoon.[106] This is not quite correctly stated; for the tide of new moon\r\nis known to be still higher than the rise at the full, but it is likely\r\nenough, that the seeming inaccuracy should be attributed, not to\r\nPytheas, but to his biographer Plutarch, who, in many instances,\r\nappears to have viewed the opinions of the old philosophers through the\r\nmist of his own prejudices and imperfect information. The fact is, that,\r\non the same day when the tide rises highest, it also ebbs lowest; and\r\nPytheas, who, according to Pliny, had recorded a tide in Britain of\r\neighty cubits, could not have been ignorant of this. Posidonius, as\r\nquoted by Strabo, maintained the existence of three periods of the tide,\r\ndaily, monthly, and annual, \"in sympathy with the moon.\"[107] Pliny, in\r\nhis vast collection of natural observations, not unaptly styled the\r\nEncyclopædia of the Antients, has the following curious passages:—\"The\r\nflow and ebb of the tide is very wonderful; it happens in a variety of\r\nways, but the cause is in the sun and moon.\"[108] He then very\r\naccurately describes the course of the tide during a revolution of the\r\nmoon, and adds: \"The flow takes place every day at a different hour;\r\nbeing waited on by the star, which rises every day in a different place\r\nfrom that of the day before, and with greedy draught drags the seas with\r\nit.\"[109] \"When the moon is in the north, and further removed from the\r\nearth, the tides are more gentle than when digressing to the south, she\r\nexerts her force with a closer effort.\"[110]\r\n\r\nThe College of Jesuits at Coimbra appears to deserve the credit of first\r\nclearly pointing out the true relation between the tides and the moon,\r\nwhich was also maintained a few years later by Antonio de Dominis and\r\nKepler. In the Society's commentary on Aristotle's book on Meteors,\r\nafter refuting the notion that the tides are caused by the light of the\r\nsun and moon, they say, \"It appears more probable to us, without any\r\nrarefaction, of which there appears no need or indication, that the moon\r\nraises the waters by some inherent power of impulsion, in the same\r\nmanner as a magnet moves iron; and according to its different aspects\r\nand approaches to the sea, and the obtuse or acute angles of its\r\nbearing, at one time to attract and raise the waters along the shore,\r\nand then again to leave them to sink down by their own weight, and to\r\ngather into a lower level.\"[111] The theory of Universal Gravitation\r\nseems here within the grasp of these philosophers, but unfortunately it\r\ndid not occur to them that possibly the same attraction might be exerted\r\non the earth as well as the water, and that the tide was merely an\r\neffect of the diminution of force, owing to the increase of distance,\r\nwith which the centre of the earth is attracted, as compared with that\r\nexerted on its surface. This idea, so happily seized afterwards by\r\nNewton, might at once have furnished them with a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the tide, which is observed on the opposite side of the\r\nearth as well as immediately under the moon. They might have seen that\r\nin the latter case the centre of the earth is pulled away from the\r\nwater, just as in the former the water is pulled away from the centre of\r\nthe earth, the sensible effect to us being in both cases precisely the\r\nsame. For want of this generalization, the inferior tide as it is called\r\npresented a formidable obstacle to this theory, and the most plausible\r\nexplanation that was given was, that this magnetic virtue radiated out\r\nfrom the moon was reflected by the solid heavens, and concentrated again\r\nas in a focus on the opposite side of the earth. The majority of modern\r\nastronomers who did not admit the existence of any solid matter fit for\r\nproducing the effect assigned to it, found a reasonable difficulty in\r\nacquiescing in this explanation. Galileo, who mentions the Archbishop of\r\nSpalatro's book, treated the theory of attraction by the moon as absurd.\r\n\"This motion of the seas is local and sensible, made in an immense mass\r\nof water, and cannot be brought to obey light, and warmth, and\r\npredominancy of occult qualities, and such like vain fancies; all which\r\nare so far from being the cause of the tide, that on the contrary the\r\ntide is the cause of them, inasmuch as it gives rise to these ideas in\r\nbrains which are more apt for talkativeness and ostentation, than for\r\nspeculation and inquiry into the secrets of Nature; who, rather than see\r\nthemselves driven to pronounce these wise, ingenuous, and modest\r\nwords—_I do not know_,—will blurt out from their tongues and pens all\r\nsorts of extravagancies.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo's own theory is introduced by the following illustration, which\r\nindeed probably suggested it, as he was in the habit of suffering no\r\nnatural phenomena, however trivial in appearance, to escape him. He felt\r\nthe advantage of this custom in being furnished on all occasions with a\r\nstock of homely illustrations, to which the daily experience of his\r\nhearers readily assented, and which he could shew to be identical in\r\nprinciple with the phenomena under discussion. That he was mistaken in\r\napplying his observations in the present instance cannot be urged\r\nagainst the incalculable value of such a habit.\r\n\r\n\"We may explain and render sensible these effects by the example of one\r\nof those barks which come continually from Lizza Fusina, with fresh\r\nwater for the use of the city of Venice. Let us suppose one of these\r\nbarks to come thence with moderate velocity along the canal, carrying\r\ngently the water with which it is filled, and then, either by touching\r\nthe bottom, or from some other hindrance which is opposed to it, let it\r\nbe notably retarded; the water will not on that account lose like the\r\nbark the impetus it has already acquired, but will forthwith run on\r\ntowards the prow where it will sensibly rise, and be depressed at the\r\nstern. If on the contrary the said vessel in the middle of its steady\r\ncourse shall receive a new and sensible increase of velocity, the\r\ncontained water before giving into it will persevere for some time in\r\nits slowness, and will be left behind that is to say towards the stern\r\nwhere consequently it will rise, and sink at the head.—Now, my masters,\r\nthat which the vessel does in respect of the water contained in it, and\r\nthat which the water does in respect of the vessel containing it, is the\r\nsame to a hair as what the Mediterranean vase does in respect of the\r\nwater which it contains, and that the waters do in respect of the\r\nMediterranean vase which contains them. We have now only to demonstrate\r\nhow, and in what manner it is true that the Mediterranean, and all other\r\ngulfs, and in short all the parts of the earth move with a motion\r\nsensibly not uniform, although no motion results thence to the whole\r\nglobe which is not perfectly uniform and regular.\"\r\n\r\nThis unequable motion is derived from a combination of the earth's\r\nmotion on her axis, and in her orbit, the consequence of which is that a\r\npoint under the sun is carried in the same direction by the annual and\r\ndiurnal velocities, whereas a point on the opposite side of the globe is\r\ncarried in opposite directions by the annual and diurnal motions, so\r\nthat in every twenty-four hours the absolute motion through space of\r\nevery point in the earth completes a cycle of varying swiftness. Those\r\nreaders who are unacquainted with the mathematical theory of motion must\r\nbe satisfied with the assurance that this specious representation is\r\nfallacious, and that the oscillation of the water does not in the least\r\nresult from the causes here assigned to it: the reasoning necessary to\r\nprove this is not elementary enough to be introduced here with\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nBesides the principal daily oscillation of the water, there is a monthly\r\ninequality in the rise and fall, of which the extremes are called the\r\nspring and neap tides: the manner in which Galileo attempted to bring\r\nhis theory to bear upon these phenomena is exceedingly curious.\r\n\r\n\"It is a natural and necessary truth, that if a body be made to revolve,\r\nthe time of revolution will be greater in a greater circle than in a\r\nless: this is universally allowed, and fully confirmed by experiments,\r\nsuch for instance as these:—In wheel clocks, especially in large ones,\r\nto regulate the going, the workmen fit up a bar capable of revolving\r\nhorizontally, and fasten two leaden weights to the ends of it; and if\r\nthe clock goes too slow, by merely approaching these weights somewhat\r\ntowards the centre of the bar, they make its vibrations more frequent,\r\nat which time they are moving in smaller circles than before.[112]—Or,\r\nif you fasten a weight to a cord which you pass round a pulley in the\r\nceiling, and whilst the weight is vibrating draw in the cord towards\r\nyou, the vibrations will become sensibly accelerated as the length of\r\nthe string diminishes. We may observe the same rule to hold among the\r\ncelestial motions of the planets, of which we have a ready instance in\r\nthe Medicean planets, which revolve in such short periods round Jupiter.\r\nWe may therefore safely conclude, that if the moon for instance shall\r\ncontinue to be forced round by the same moving power, and were to move\r\nin a smaller circle, it would shorten the time of its revolution. Now\r\nthis very thing happens in fact to the moon, which I have just advanced\r\non a supposition. Let us call to mind that we have already concluded\r\nwith Copernicus, that it is impossible to separate the moon from the\r\nearth, round which without doubt it moves in a month: we must also\r\nremember that the globe of the earth, accompanied always by the moon,\r\nrevolves in the great circle round the sun in a year, in which time the\r\nmoon revolves round the earth about thirteen times, whence it follows\r\nthat the moon is sometimes near the sun, that is to say between the\r\nearth and sun, sometimes far from it, when she is on the outside of the\r\nearth. Now if it be true that the power which moves the earth and the\r\nmoon round the sun remains of the same efficacy, and if it be true that\r\nthe same moveable, acted on by the same force, passes over similar arcs\r\nof circles in a time which is least when the circle is smallest, we are\r\nforced to the conclusion that at new moon, when in conjunction with the\r\nsun, the moon passes over greater arcs of the orbit round the sun, than\r\nwhen in opposition at full moon; and this inequality of the moon will be\r\nshared by the earth also. So that exactly the same thing happens as in\r\nthe balance of the clocks; for the moon here represents the leaden\r\nweight, which at one time is fixed at a greater distance from the centre\r\nto make the vibrations slower, and at another time nearer to accelerate\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nWallis adopted and improved this theory in a paper which he inserted in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions for 1666, in which he declares, that the\r\ncircular motion round the sun should be considered as taking place at a\r\npoint which is the centre of gravity of the earth and moon. \"To the\r\nfirst objection, that it appears not how two bodies that have no tie can\r\nhave one common centre of gravity, I shall only answer, that it is\r\nharder to show how they have it, than that they have it.\"[113] As Wallis\r\nwas perfectly competent from the time at which he lived, and his\r\nknowledge of the farthest advances of science in his time, to appreciate\r\nthe value of Galileo's writings, we shall conclude this chapter with the\r\njudgment that he has passed upon them in the same paper. \"Since Galileo,\r\nand after him Torricelli and others have applied mechanical principles\r\nto the solving of philosophical difficulties, natural philosophy is well\r\nknown to have been rendered more intelligible, and to have made a much\r\ngreater progress in less than a hundred years than before for many\r\nages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] See page 56.\r\n\r\n[94] Playfair's Dissertation, Supp. Encyc.

Venturi informs us that\r\nhe had seen in the collection from which he derived a great part of the\r\nsubstance of his Memoirs of Galileo, about one hundred and twenty\r\nmanuscript letters, dated between the years 1623 and 1633, addressed to\r\nhim by his daughter Maria, who with her sister had attached herself to\r\nthe convent of St. Matthew, close to Galileo's usual place of residence.\r\nIt is difficult not to think that much interesting information might be\r\nobtained from these, with respect to Galileo's domestic character. The\r\nvery few published extracts confirm our favourable impressions of it,\r\nand convey a pleasing idea of this his favourite daughter. Even when, in\r\nher affectionate eagerness to soothe her father's wounded feelings at\r\nthe close of his imprisonment in Rome, she dwells with delight upon her\r\nhopes of being allowed to relieve him, by taking on herself the\r\npenitential recitations which formed a part of his sentence, the\r\nprevalent feeling excited in every one by the perusal must surely be\r\nsympathy with the filial tenderness which it is impossible to\r\nmisunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe joy she had anticipated in again meeting her parent, and in\r\ncompensating to him by her attentive affection the insults of his\r\nmalignant enemies, was destined to be but of short duration. Almost in\r\nthe same month in which Galileo returned to Arcetri she was seized with\r\na fatal illness; and already in the beginning of April, 1634, we learn\r\nher death from the fruitless condolence of his friends. He was deeply\r\nand bitterly affected by this additional blow, which came upon him when\r\nhe was himself in a weak and declining state of health, and his answers\r\nbreathe a spirit of the most hopeless and gloomy despondency.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written in April to Bocchineri, his son's father-in-law, he\r\nsays: \"The hernia has returned worse than at first: my pulse is\r\nintermitting, accompanied with a palpitation of the heart; an\r\nimmeasurable sadness and melancholy; an entire loss of appetite; I am\r\nhateful to myself; and in short I feel that I am called incessantly by\r\nmy dear daughter. In this state, I do not think it advisable that\r\nVincenzo should set out on his journey, and leave me, when every hour\r\nsomething may occur, which would make it expedient that he should be\r\nhere.\" In this extremity of ill health, Galileo requested leave to go to\r\nFlorence for the advantage of medical assistance; but far from obtaining\r\npermission, it was intimated that any additional importunities would be\r\nnoticed by depriving him of the partial liberty he was then allowed to\r\nenjoy. After several years confinement at Arcetri, during the whole of\r\nwhich time he suffered from continual indisposition, the inquisitor\r\nFariano wrote to him in 1638, that the Pope permitted his removal to\r\nFlorence, for the purpose of recovering his health; requiring him at the\r\nsame time to present himself at the Office of the Inquisition, where he\r\nwould learn the conditions on which this favour had been granted. These\r\nwere that he should neither quit his house nor receive his friends\r\nthere; and so closely was the letter of these instructions adhered to,\r\nthat he was obliged to obtain a special permission to go out to attend\r\nmass during Passion week. The strictness with which all personal\r\nintercourse with his friends was interrupted, is manifest from the\r\nresult of the following letter from the Duke of Tuscany's secretary of\r\nstate to Nicolini, his ambassador at Rome. \"Signor Galileo Galilei, from\r\nhis great age and the illnesses which afflict him, is in a condition\r\nsoon to go to another world; and although in this the eternal memory of\r\nhis fame and value is already secured, yet his Highness is greatly\r\ndesirous that the world should sustain as little loss as possible by his\r\ndeath; that his labours may not perish, but for the public good may be\r\nbrought to that perfection which he will not be able to give them. He\r\nhas in his thoughts many things worthy of him, which he cannot be\r\nprevailed on to communicate to any but Father Benedetto Castelli, in\r\nwhom he has entire confidence. His Highness wishes therefore that you\r\nshould see Castelli, and induce him to procure leave to come to Florence\r\nfor a few months for this purpose, which his Highness has very much at\r\nheart; and if he obtains permission, as his Highness hopes, you will\r\nfurnish him with money and every thing else he may require for his\r\njourney.\" Castelli, it will be remembered, was at this time salaried by\r\nthe court of Rome. Nicolini answered that Castelli had been himself to\r\nthe Pope to ask leave to go to Florence. Urban immediately intimated his\r\nsuspicions that his design was to see Galileo, and upon Castelli's\r\nstating that certainly it would be impossible for him to refrain from\r\nattempting to see him, he received permission to visit him in the\r\ncompany of an officer of the Inquisition. At the end of some months\r\nGalileo was remanded to Arcetri, which he never again quitted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his other infirmities, a disorder which some years before\r\nhad affected the sight of his right eye returned in 1636; in the course\r\nof the ensuing year the other eye began to fail also, and in a few\r\nmonths he became totally blind. It would be difficult to find any even\r\namong those who are the most careless to make a proper use of the\r\ninvaluable blessing of sight, who could bear unmoved to be deprived of\r\nit, but on Galileo the loss fell with peculiar and terrible severity; on\r\nhim who had boasted that he would never cease from using the senses\r\nwhich God had given him, in declaring the glory of his works, and the\r\nbusiness of whose life had been the splendid fulfilment of that\r\nundertaking. \"The noblest eye is darkened,\" said Castelli, \"which nature\r\never made: an eye so privileged, and gifted with such rare qualities,\r\nthat it may with truth be said to have seen more than all of those who\r\nare gone, and to have opened the eyes of all who are to come.\" His own\r\npatience and resignation under this fatal calamity are truly wonderful;\r\nand if occasionally a word of complaint escaped him, it was in the\r\nchastened tone of the following expressions—\"Alas! your dear friend and\r\nservant Galileo has become totally and irreparably blind; so that this\r\nheaven, this earth, this universe, which with wonderful observations I\r\nhad enlarged a hundred and thousand times beyond the belief of by-gone\r\nages, henceforward for me is shrunk into the narrow space which I myself\r\nfill in it.—So it pleases God: it shall therefore please me also.\"\r\nHopes were at first entertained by Galileo's friends, that the\r\nblindness was occasioned by cataracts, and that he might look forward to\r\nrelief from the operation of couching; but it very soon appeared that\r\nthe disorder was not in the humours of the eye, but in a cloudiness of\r\nthe cornea, the symptoms of which all external remedies failed to\r\nalleviate.\r\n\r\nAs long as the power was left him, he had indefatigably continued his\r\nastronomical observations. Just before his sight began to decay, he had\r\nobserved a new phenomenon in the moon, which is now known by the name of\r\nthe moon's libration, the nature of which we will shortly explain. A\r\nremarkable circumstance connected with the moon's motion is, that the\r\nsame side is always visible from the earth, showing that the moon turns\r\nonce on her own axis in exactly the time of her monthly revolution.[114]\r\nBut Galileo, who was by this time familiar with the whole of the moon's\r\nvisible surface, observed that the above-mentioned effect does not\r\naccurately take place, but that a small part on either side comes\r\nalternately forward into sight, and then again recedes, according to the\r\nmoon's various positions in the heavens. He was not long in detecting\r\none of the causes of this apparent libratory or rocking motion. It is\r\npartly occasioned by our distance as spectators from the centre of the\r\nearth, which is also the centre of the moon's motion. In consequence of\r\nthis, as the moon rises in the sky we get an additional view of the\r\nlower half, and lose sight of a small part of the upper half which was\r\nvisible to us while we were looking down upon her when low in the\r\nhorizon. The other cause is not quite so simple, nor is it so certain\r\nthat Galileo adverted to it: it is however readily intelligible even to\r\nthose who are unacquainted with astronomy, if they will receive as a\r\nfact that the monthly motion of the moon is not uniform, but that she\r\nmoves quicker at one time than another, whilst the motion of rotation on\r\nher own axis, like that of the earth, is perfectly uniform. A very\r\nlittle reflection will show that the observed phenomenon will\r\nnecessarily follow. If the moon did not turn on her axis, every side of\r\nher would be successively presented, in the course of a month, towards\r\nthe earth; it is the motion of rotation which tends to carry the newly\r\ndiscovered parts out of sight.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the moon to be in that part of her orbit where she moves\r\nwith her average motion, and that she is moving towards the part where\r\nshe moves most quickly. If the motion in the orbit were to remain the\r\nsame all the way round, the motion of rotation would be just sufficient\r\nat every point to bring round the same part of the moon directly in\r\nfront of the earth. But since, from the supposed point, the moon is\r\nmoving for some time round the earth with a motion continually growing\r\nquicker, the motion of rotation is not sufficiently quick to carry out\r\nof sight the entire part discovered by the motion of translation. We\r\ntherefore get a glimpse of a narrow strip on the side _from_ which the\r\nmoon is moving, which strip grows broader and broader, till she passes\r\nthe point where she moves most swiftly, and reaches the point of average\r\nswiftness on the opposite side of her orbit. Her motion is now\r\ncontinually growing slower, and therefore from this point the motion of\r\nrotation is too swift, and carries too much out of sight, or in other\r\nwords, brings into sight a strip on the side _towards_ which the moon is\r\nmoving. This increases till she passes the point of least swiftness, and\r\narrives at the point from which we began to trace her course, and the\r\nphenomena are repeated in the same order.\r\n\r\nThis interesting observation closes the long list of Galileo's\r\ndiscoveries in the heavens. After his abjuration, he ostensibly withdrew\r\nhimself in a great measure from his astronomical pursuits, and employed\r\nhimself till 1636 principally with his Dialogues on Motion, the last\r\nwork of consequence that he published. In that year he entered into\r\ncorrespondence with the Elzevirs, through his friend Micanzio, on the\r\nproject of printing a complete edition of his writings. Among the\r\nletters which Micanzio wrote on the subject is one intimating that he\r\nhad enjoyed the gratification, in his quality of Theologian to the\r\nRepublic of Venice, of refusing his sanction to a work written against\r\nGalileo and Copernicus. The temper however in which this refusal was\r\nannounced, contrasts singularly with that of the Roman Inquisitors. \"A\r\nbook was brought to me which a Veronese Capuchin has been writing, and\r\nwished to print, denying the motion of the earth. I was inclined to let\r\nit go, to make the world laugh, for the ignorant beast entitles every\r\none of the twelve arguments which compose his book, 'An irrefragable and\r\nundeniable demonstration,' and then adduces nothing but such childish\r\ntrash as every man of sense has long discarded. For instance, this poor\r\nanimal understands so much geometry and mathematics, that he brings\r\nforward as a demonstration, that if the earth could move, having nothing\r\nto support it, it must necessarily fall. He ought to have added that\r\nthen we should catch all the quails. But when I saw that he speaks\r\nindecently of you, and has had the impudence to put down an account of\r\nwhat passed lately, saying that he is in possession of the whole of your\r\nprocess and sentence, I desired the man who brought it to me to go and\r\nbe hanged. But you know the ingenuity of impertinence; I suspect he will\r\nsucceed elsewhere, because he is so enamoured of his absurdities, that\r\nhe believes them more firmly than his Bible.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Galileo's condemnation at Rome, he had been placed by the\r\nInquisition in the list of authors the whole of whose writings, '_edita\r\net edenda_,' were strictly forbidden. Micanzio could not even obtain\r\npermission to reprint the Essay on Floating Bodies, in spite of his\r\nprotestations that it did not in any way relate to the Copernican\r\ntheory. This was the greatest stigma with which the Inquisition were in\r\nthe habit of branding obnoxious authors; and, in consequence of it, when\r\nGalileo had completed his Dialogues on Motion, he found great difficulty\r\nin contriving their publication, the nature of which may be learned from\r\nthe account which Pieroni sent to Galileo of his endeavours to print\r\nthem in Germany. He first took the manuscript to Vienna, but found that\r\nevery book printed there must receive the approbation of the Jesuits;\r\nand Galileo's old antagonist, Scheiner, happening to be in that city,\r\nPieroni feared lest he should interfere to prevent the publication\r\naltogether, if the knowledge of it should reach him. Through the\r\nintervention of Cardinal Dietrichstein, he therefore got permission to\r\nhave it printed at Olmutz, and that it should be approved by a\r\nDominican, so as to keep the whole business a secret from Scheiner and\r\nhis party; but during this negociation the Cardinal suddenly died, and\r\nPieroni being besides dissatisfied with the Olmutz type, carried back\r\nthe manuscript to Vienna, from which he heard that Scheiner had gone\r\ninto Silesia. A new approbation was there procured, and the work was\r\njust on the point of being sent to press, when the dreaded Scheiner\r\nre-appeared in Vienna, on which Pieroni again thought it advisable to\r\nsuspend the impression till his departure. In the mean time his own duty\r\nas a military architect in the Emperor's service carried him to Prague,\r\nwhere Cardinal Harrach, on a former occasion, had offered him the use of\r\nthe newly-erected University press. But Harrach happened not to be at\r\nPrague, and this plan like the rest became abortive. In the meantime\r\nGalileo, wearied with these delays, had engaged with Louis Elzevir, who\r\nundertook to print the Dialogues at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly evident from Galileo's correspondence that this edition\r\nwas printed with his full concurrence, although, in order to obviate\r\nfurther annoyance, he pretended that it was pirated from a manuscript\r\ncopy which he sent into France to the Comte de Noailles, to whom the\r\nwork is dedicated. The same dissimulation had been previously thought\r\nnecessary, on occasion of the Latin translation of \"The Dialogues on the\r\nSystem,\" by Bernegger, which Galileo expressly requested through his\r\nfriend Deodati, and of which he more than once privately signified his\r\napprobation, presenting the translator with a valuable telescope,\r\nalthough he publicly protested against its appearance. The story which\r\nBernegger introduced in his preface, tending to exculpate Galileo from\r\nany share in the publication, is by his own confession a mere fiction.\r\nNoailles had been ambassador at Rome, and, by his conduct there, well\r\ndeserved the compliment which Galileo paid him on the present occasion.\r\n\r\nAs an introduction to the account of this work, which Galileo considered\r\nthe best he had ever produced, it will become necessary to premise a\r\nslight sketch of the nature of the mechanical philosophy which he found\r\nprevailing, nearly as it had been delivered by Aristotle, with the same\r\nview with which we introduced specimens of the astronomical opinions\r\ncurrent when Galileo began to write on that subject: they serve to show\r\nthe nature and objects of the reasoning which he had to oppose; and,\r\nwithout some exposition of them, the aim and value of many of his\r\narguments would be imperfectly understood and appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[114] Frisi says that Galileo did not perceive this conclusion (Elogio\r\ndel Galileo); but see The Dial. on the System, Dial. 1. pp. 61, 62, 85.\r\nEdit. 1744. Plutarch says, (De Placitis Philos. lib. ii. c. 28,) that\r\nthe Pythagoreans believed the moon to have inhabitants fifteen times as\r\nlarge as men, and that their day is fifteen times as long as ours. It\r\nseems probable, that the former of these opinions was engrafted on the\r\nlatter, which is true, and implies a perception of the fact in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n    _State of the Science of Motion before Galileo._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is generally difficult to trace any branch of human knowledge up to\r\nits origin, and more especially when, as in the case of mechanics, it is\r\nvery closely connected with the immediate wants of mankind. Little has\r\nbeen told to us when we are informed that so soon as a man might wish to\r\nremove a heavy stone, \"he would be led, by natural instinct, to slide\r\nunder it the end of some long instrument, and that the same instinct\r\nwould teach him either to raise the further end, or to press it\r\ndownwards, so as to turn round upon some support placed as near to the\r\nstone as possible.\"[115]\r\n\r\nMontucla's history would have lost nothing in value, if, omitting \"this\r\nphilosophical view of the birth of the art,\" he had contented himself\r\nwith his previous remark, that there can be little doubt that men were\r\nfamiliar with the use of mechanical contrivances long before the idea\r\noccurred of enumerating or describing them, or even of examining very\r\nclosely the nature and limits of the aid they are capable of affording.\r\nThe most careless observer indeed could scarcely overlook that the\r\nweights heaved up with a lever, or rolled along a slope into their\r\nintended places, reached them more slowly than those which the workmen\r\ncould lift directly in their hands; but it probably needed a much longer\r\ntime to enable them to see the exact relation which, in these and all\r\nother machines, exists between the increase of the power to move, and\r\nthe decreasing swiftness of the thing moved.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to Galileo's Treatise on Mechanical Science, published in\r\n1592, he is at some pains to set in a clear light the real advantages\r\nbelonging to the use of machines, \"which (says he) I have thought it\r\nnecessary to do, because, if I mistake not, I see almost all mechanics\r\ndeceiving themselves in the belief that, by the help of a machine, they\r\ncan raise a greater weight than they are able to lift by the exertion of\r\nthe same force without it.—Now if we take any determinate weight, and\r\nany force, and any distance whatever, it is beyond doubt that we can\r\nmove the weight to that distance by means of that force; because even\r\nalthough the force may be exceedingly small, if we divide the weight\r\ninto a number of fragments, each of which is not too much for our force,\r\nand carry these pieces one by one, at length we shall have removed the\r\nwhole weight; nor can we reasonably say at the end of our work, that\r\nthis great weight has been moved and carried away by a force less than\r\nitself, unless we add that the force has passed several times over the\r\nspace through which the whole weight has gone but once. From which it\r\nappears that the velocity of the force (understanding by velocity the\r\nspace gone through in a given time) has been as many times greater than\r\nthat of the weight, as the weight is greater than the force: nor can we\r\non that account say that a great force is overcome by a small one,\r\ncontrary to nature: then only might we say that nature is overcome when\r\na small force moves a great weight as swiftly as itself, which we assert\r\nto be absolutely impossible with any machine either already or hereafter\r\nto be contrived. But since it may occasionally happen that we have but a\r\nsmall force, and want to move a great weight without dividing it into\r\npieces, then we must have recourse to a machine by means of which we\r\nshall remove the given weight, with the given force, through the\r\nrequired space. But nevertheless the force as before will have to travel\r\nover that very same space as many times repeated as the weight surpasses\r\nits power, so that, at the end of our work, we shall find that we have\r\nderived no other benefit from our machine than that we have carried away\r\nthe same weight altogether, which if divided into pieces we could have\r\ncarried without the machine, by the same force, through the same space,\r\nin the same time. This is one of the advantages of a machine, because it\r\noften happens that we have a lack of force but abundance of time, and\r\nthat we wish to move great weights all at once.\"\r\n\r\nThis compensation of force and time has been fancifully personified by\r\nsaying that Nature cannot be cheated, and in scientific treatises on\r\nmechanics, is called the \"principle of virtual velocities,\" consisting\r\nin the theorem that two weights will balance each other on any machine,\r\nno matter how complicated or intricate the connecting contrivances may\r\nbe, when one weight bears to the other the same proportion that the\r\nspace through which the latter would be raised bears to that through\r\nwhich the former would sink, in the first instant of their motion, if\r\nthe machine were stirred by a third force. The whole theory of machines\r\nconsists merely in generalizing and following out this principle into\r\nits consequences; combined, when the machines are in a state of motion,\r\nwith another principle equally elementary, but to which our present\r\nsubject does not lead us to allude more particularly.\r\n\r\nThe credit of making known the principle of virtual velocities is\r\nuniversally given to Galileo; and so far deservedly, that he undoubtedly\r\nperceived the importance of it, and by introducing it everywhere into\r\nhis writings succeeded in recommending it to others; so that five and\r\ntwenty years after his death, Borelli, who had been one of Galileo's\r\npupils, calls it \"that mechanical principle with which everybody is so\r\nfamiliar[116],\" and from that time to the present it has continued to be\r\ntaught as an elementary truth in most systems of mechanics. But although\r\nGalileo had the merit in this, as in so many other cases, of\r\nfamiliarizing and reconciling the world to the reception of truth, there\r\nare remarkable traces before his time of the employment of this same\r\nprinciple, some of which have been strangely disregarded. Lagrange\r\nasserts[117] that the ancients were entirely ignorant of the principle\r\nof virtual velocities, although Galileo, to whom he refers it,\r\ndistinctly mentions that he himself found it in the writings of\r\nAristotle. Montucla quotes a passage from Aristotle's Physics, in which\r\nthe law is stated generally, but adds that he did not perceive its\r\nimmediate application to the lever, and other machines. The passage to\r\nwhich Galileo alludes is in Aristotle's Mechanics, where, in discussing\r\nthe properties of the lever, he says expressly, \"the same force will\r\nraise a greater weight, in proportion as the force is applied at a\r\ngreater distance from the fulcrum, and the reason, as I have already\r\nsaid, is because it describes a greater circle; and a weight which is\r\nfarther removed from the centre is made to move through a greater\r\nspace.\"[118]\r\n\r\nIt is true, that in the last mentioned treatise, Aristotle has given\r\nother reasons which belong to a very different kind of philosophy, and\r\nwhich may lead us to doubt whether he fully saw the force of the one we\r\nhave just quoted. It appeared to him not wonderful that so many\r\nmechanical paradoxes (as he called them) should be connected with\r\ncircular motion, since the circle itself seemed of so paradoxical a\r\nnature. \"For, in the first place, it is made up of an immoveable centre,\r\nand a moveable radius, qualities which are contrary to each other. 2dly.\r\nIts circumference is both convex and concave. 3dly. The motion by which\r\nit is described is both forward and backward, for the describing radius\r\ncomes back to the place from which it started. 4thly. The radius is\r\n_one_; but every point of it moves in describing the circle with a\r\ndifferent degree of swiftness.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Aristotle may have borrowed the idea of virtual velocities,\r\ncontrasting so strongly with his other physical notions, from some older\r\nwriter; possibly from Archytas, who, we are told, was the first to\r\nreduce the science of mechanics to methodical order;[119] and who by the\r\ntestimony of his countrymen was gifted with extraordinary talents,\r\nalthough none of his works have come down to us. The other principles\r\nand maxims of Aristotle's mechanical philosophy, which we shall have\r\noccasion to cite, are scattered through his books on Mechanics, on the\r\nHeavens, and in his Physical Lectures, and will therefore follow rather\r\nunconnectedly, though we have endeavoured to arrange them with as much\r\nregularity as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter defining a body to be that which is divisible in every direction,\r\nAristotle proceeds to inquire how it happens that a body has only the\r\nthree dimensions of length, breadth, and thickness; and seems to think\r\nhe has given a reason in saying that, when we speak of two things, we do\r\nnot say \"all,\" but \"both,\" and three is the first number of which we say\r\n\"all.\"[120] When he comes to speak of motion, he says, \"If motion is not\r\nunderstood, we cannot but remain ignorant of Nature. Motion appears to\r\nbe of the nature of continuous quantities, and in continuous quantity\r\ninfinity first makes its appearance; so as to furnish some with a\r\ndefinition who say that continuous quantity is that which is infinitely\r\ndivisible.—Moreover, unless there be time, space, and a vacuum, it is\r\nimpossible that there should be motion.\"[121]—Few propositions of\r\nAristotle's physical philosophy are more notorious than his assertion\r\nthat nature abhors a vacuum, on which account this last passage is the\r\nmore remarkable, as he certainly did not go so far as to deny the\r\nexistence of motion, and therefore asserts here the necessity of that of\r\nwhich he afterwards attempts to show the absurdity.—\"Motion is the\r\nenergy of what exists in power so far forth as so existing. It is that\r\nact of a moveable which belongs to its power of moving.\"[122] After\r\nstruggling through such passages as the preceding we come at last to a\r\nresting-place.—\"It is difficult to understand what motion is.\"—When\r\nthe same question was once proposed to another Greek philosopher, he\r\nwalked away, saying, \"I cannot tell you, but I will show you;\" an answer\r\nintrinsically worth more than all the subtleties of Aristotle, who was\r\nnot humble-minded enough to discover that he was tasking his genius\r\nbeyond the limits marked out for human comprehension.\r\n\r\nHe labours in the same manner and with the same success to vary the idea\r\nof space. He begins the next book with declaring, that \"those who say\r\nthere is a vacuum assert the existence of space; for a vacuum is space,\r\nin which there is no substance;\" and after a long and tedious reasoning\r\nconcludes that, \"not only what space is, but also whether there be such\r\na thing, cannot but be doubted.\"[123] Of time he is content to say\r\nmerely, that \"it is clear that time is not motion, but that without\r\nmotion there would be no time;\"[124] and there is perhaps little fault\r\nto be found with this remark, understanding motion in the general sense\r\nin which Aristotle here applies it, of every description of change.\r\n\r\nProceeding after these remarks on the nature of motion in general to the\r\nmotion of bodies, we are told that \"all local motion is either straight,\r\ncircular, or compounded of these two; for these two are the only simple\r\nsorts of motion. Bodies are divided into simple and concrete; simple\r\nbodies are those which have naturally a principle of motion, as fire and\r\nearth, and their kinds. By simple motion is meant the motion of a simple\r\nbody.\"[125] By these expressions Aristotle did not mean that a simple\r\nbody cannot have what he calls a compound motion, but in that case he\r\ncalled the motion violent or unnatural; this division of motion into\r\nnatural and violent runs through the whole of the mechanical philosophy\r\nfounded upon his principles. \"Circular motion is the only one which can\r\nbe endless;\"[126] the reason of which is given in another place: for\r\n\"that cannot be doing, which cannot be done; and therefore it cannot be\r\nthat a body should be moving towards a point (_i.e._ the end of an\r\ninfinite straight line) whither no motion is sufficient to bring\r\nit.\"[127] Bacon seems to have had these passages in view when he\r\nindulged in the reflections which we have quoted in page 14. \"There are\r\nfour kinds of motion of one thing by another: Drawing, Pushing,\r\nCarrying, Rolling. Of these, Carrying and Rolling may be referred to\r\nDrawing and Pushing.[128]—The prime mover and the thing moved are\r\nalways in contact.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle of the composition of motions is stated very plainly:\r\n\"when a moveable is urged in two directions with motions bearing an\r\nindefinitely small ratio to each other, it moves necessarily in a\r\nstraight line, which is the diameter of the figure formed by drawing the\r\ntwo lines of direction in that ratio;\"[129] and adds, in a singularly\r\ncurious passage, \"but when it is urged for any time with two motions\r\nwhich have an indefinitely small ratio one to another, the motion cannot\r\nbe straight, so that a body describes a curve, when it is urged by two\r\nmotions bearing an indefinitely small ratio one to another, and lasting\r\nan indefinitely small time.\"[130]\r\n\r\nHe seemed on the point of discovering some of the real laws of motion,\r\nwhen he was led to ask—\"Why are bodies in motion more easily moved than\r\nthose which are at rest?—And why does the motion cease of things cast\r\ninto the air? Is it that the force has ceased which sent them forth, or\r\nis there a struggle against the motion, or is it through the disposition\r\nto fall, does it become stronger than the projectile force, or is it\r\nfoolish to entertain doubts on this question, when the body has quitted\r\nthe principle of its motion?\" A commentator at the close of the\r\nsixteenth century says on this passage: \"They fall because every thing\r\nrecurs to its nature; for if you throw a stone a thousand times into the\r\nair, it will never accustom itself to move upwards.\" Perhaps we shall\r\nnow find it difficult not to smile at the idea we may form of this\r\nluckless experimentalist, teaching stones to fly; yet it may be useful\r\nto remember that it is only because we have already collected an opinion\r\nfrom the results of a vast number of observations in the daily\r\nexperience of life, that our ridicule would not be altogether misplaced,\r\nand that we are totally unable to determine by any kind of reasoning,\r\nunaccompanied by experiment, whether a stone thrown into the air would\r\nfall again to the earth, or move for ever upwards, or in any other\r\nconceivable manner and direction.\r\n\r\nThe opinion which Aristotle held, that motion must be caused by\r\nsomething in contact with the body moved, led him to his famous theory\r\nthat falling bodies are accelerated by the air through which they pass.\r\nWe will show how it was attempted to explain this process when we come\r\nto speak of more modern authors. He classed natural bodies into heavy\r\nand light, remarking at the same time that it is clear that there are\r\nsome bodies possessing neither gravity nor levity.\"[131] By light bodies\r\nhe understood those which have a natural tendency to move from the\r\nearth, observing that \"that which is lighter is not always light.\"[132]\r\nHe maintained that the heavenly bodies were altogether devoid of\r\ngravity; and we have already had occasion to mention his assertion, that\r\na large body falls faster than a small one in proportion to its\r\nweight.[133] With this opinion may be classed another great mistake, in\r\nmaintaining that the same bodies fall through different mediums, as air\r\nor water, with velocities reciprocally proportional to their densities.\r\nBy a singular inversion of experimental science, Cardan, relying on this\r\nassertion, proposed in the sixteenth century to determine the densities\r\nof air and water by observing the different times taken by a stone in\r\nfalling through them.[134] Galileo inquired afterwards why the\r\nexperiment should not be made with a cork, which pertinent question put\r\nan end to the theory.\r\n\r\nThere are curious traces still preserved in the poem of Lucretius of a\r\nmechanical philosophy, of which the credit is in general given to\r\nDemocritus, where many principles are inculcated strongly at variance\r\nwith Aristotle's notions. We find absolute levity denied, and not only\r\nthe assertion that in a vacuum all things would fall, but that they\r\nwould fall with the same velocity; and the inequalities which we observe\r\nare attributed to the right cause, the impediment of the air, although\r\nthe error remains of believing the velocity of bodies falling through\r\nthe air to be proportional to their weight.[135] Such specimens of this\r\nearlier philosophy may well indispose us towards Aristotle, who was as\r\nsuccessful in the science of motion as he was in astronomy in\r\nsuppressing the knowledge of a theory so much sounder than that which he\r\nimposed so long upon the credulity of his blinded admirers.\r\n\r\nAn agreeable contrast to Aristotle's mystical sayings and fruitless\r\nsyllogisms is presented in Archimedes' book on Equilibrium, in which he\r\ndemonstrates very satisfactorily, though with greater cumbrousness of\r\napparatus than is now thought necessary, the principal properties of the\r\nlever. This and the Treatise on the Equilibrium of Floating Bodies are\r\nthe only mechanical works which have reached us of this writer, who was\r\nby common consent one of the most accomplished mathematicians of\r\nantiquity. Ptolemy the astronomer wrote also a Treatise on Mechanics,\r\nnow lost, which probably contained much that would be interesting in the\r\nhistory of mechanics; for Pappus says, in the Preface to the Eighth Book\r\nof his Mathematical Collections: \"There is no occasion for me to explain\r\nwhat is meant by a heavy, and what by a light body, and why bodies are\r\ncarried up and down, and in what sense these very words 'up' and 'down'\r\nare to be taken, and by what limits they are bounded; for all this is\r\ndeclared in Ptolemy's Mechanics.\"[136] This book of Ptolemy's appears to\r\nhave been also known by Eutocius, a commentator of Archimedes, who lived\r\nabout the end of the fifth century of our era; he intimates that the\r\ndoctrines contained in it are grounded upon Aristotle's; if so, its loss\r\nis less to be lamented. Pappus's own book deserves attention for the\r\nenumeration which he makes of the mechanical powers, namely, the wheel\r\nand axle, the lever, pullies, the wedge and the screw. He gives the\r\ncredit to Hero and Philo of having shown, in works which have not\r\nreached us, that the theory of all these machines is the same. In Pappus\r\nwe also find the first attempt to discover the force necessary to\r\nsupport a given weight on an inclined plane. This in fact is involved in\r\nthe theory of the screw; and the same vicious reasoning which Pappus\r\nemploys on this occasion was probably found in those treatises which he\r\nquotes with so much approbation. Numerous as are the faults of his\r\npretended demonstration, it was received undoubtingly for a long period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chain.]\r\n\r\nThe credit of first giving the true theory of equilibrium on the\r\ninclined plane is usually ascribed to Stevin, although, as we shall\r\npresently show, with very little reason. Stevin supposed a chain to be\r\nplaced over two inclined planes, and to hang down in the manner\r\nrepresented in the figure. He then urged that the chain would be in\r\nequilibrium; for otherwise, it would incessantly continue in motion, if\r\nthere were any cause why it should begin to move. This being conceded,\r\nhe remarks further, that the parts AD and BD are also in equilibrium,\r\nbeing exactly similar to each other; and therefore if they are taken\r\naway, the remaining parts AC and BC will also be in equilibrium. The\r\nweights of these parts are proportional to the lengths AC and BC; and\r\nhence Stevin concluded that two weights would balance on two inclined\r\nplanes, which are to each other as the lengths of the planes included\r\nbetween the same parallels to the horizon.[137] This conclusion is the\r\ncorrect one, and there is certainly great ingenuity in this contrivance\r\nto facilitate the demonstration; it must not however be mistaken for an\r\n_à priori_ proof, as it sometimes seems to have been: we should remember\r\nthat the experiments which led to the principle of virtual velocities\r\nare also necessary to show the absurdity of supposing a perpetual\r\nmotion, which is made the foundation of this theorem. That principle had\r\nbeen applied directly to determine the same proportion in a work written\r\nlong before, where it has remained singularly concealed from the notice\r\nof most who have written on this subject. The book bears the name of\r\nJordanus, who lived at Namur in the thirteenth century; but Commandine,\r\nwho refers to it in his Commentary on Pappus, considers it as the work\r\nof an earlier period. The author takes the principle of virtual\r\nvelocities for the groundwork of his explanations, both of the lever and\r\ninclined plane; the latter will not occupy much space, and in an\r\nhistorical point of view is too curious to be omitted.\r\n\r\n\"_Quæst. 10._—If two weights descend by paths of different\r\nobliquities, and the proportion be the same of the weights and the\r\ninclinations taken in the same order, they will have the same descending\r\nforce. By the inclinations, I do not mean the angles, but the paths up\r\nto the point in which both meet the same perpendicular.[138] Let,\r\ntherefore, _e_ be the weight upon _dc_, and _h_ upon _da_, and let _e_\r\nbe to _h_ as _dc_ to _da_. I say these weights, in this situation, are\r\nequally effective. Take _dk_ equally inclined with _dc_, and upon it a\r\nweight equal to _e_, which call 6. If possible let _e_ descend to _l_,\r\nso as to raise _h_ to _m_, and take 6_n_ equal to _hm_ or _el_, and draw\r\nthe horizontal and perpendicular lines as in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Then _nz_:_n_6 :: _db_:_dk_\r\n  and _mh_:_mx_ :: _da_:_db_\r\n\r\ntherefore _nz_:_mx_ :: _da_:_dk_ :: _h_:6, _and therefore since er is\r\nnot able to raise_ 6 _to n, neither will it be able to raise h to m_;\r\ntherefore they will remain as they are.\"[139] The passage in Italics\r\ntacitly assumes the principle in question. Tartalea, who edited\r\nJordanus's book in 1565, has copied this theorem _verbatim_ into one of\r\nhis own treatises, and from that time it appears to have attracted no\r\nfurther attention. The rest of the book is of an inferior description.\r\nWe find Aristotle's doctrine repeated, that the velocity of a falling\r\nbody is proportional to its weight; that the weight of a heavy body\r\nchanges with its form; and other similar opinions. The manner in which\r\nfalling bodies are accelerated by the air is given in detail. \"By its\r\nfirst motion the heavy body will drag after it what is behind, and move\r\nwhat is just below it; and these when put in motion move what is next to\r\nthem, so that by being set in motion they less impede the falling body.\r\nIn this manner it has the effect of being heavier, and impels still more\r\nthose which give way before it, until at last they are no longer\r\nimpelled, but begin to drag. And thus it happens that its gravity is\r\nincreased by their attraction, and their motion by its gravity, whence\r\nwe see that its velocity is continually multiplied.\"\r\n\r\nIn this short review of the state of mechanical science before Galileo,\r\nthe name of Guido Ubaldi ought not to be omitted, although his works\r\ncontain little or nothing original. We have already mentioned Benedetti\r\nas having successfully attacked some of Aristotle's statical doctrines,\r\nbut it is to be noticed that the laws of motion were little if at all\r\nexamined by any of these writers. There are a few theorems connected\r\nwith this latter subject in Cardan's extraordinary book \"On\r\nProportions,\" but for the most part false and contradictory. In the\r\nseventy-first proposition of his fifth book, he examines the force of\r\nthe screw in supporting a given weight, and determines it accurately on\r\nthe principle of virtual velocities; namely, that the power applied at\r\nthe end of the horizontal lever must make a complete circuit at that\r\ndistance from the centre, whilst the weight rises through the\r\nperpendicular height of the thread. The very next proposition in the\r\nsame page is to find the same relation between the power and weight on\r\nan inclined plane; and although the identity of principle in these two\r\nmechanical aids was well known, yet Cardan declares the necessary\r\nsustaining force to vary as the angle of inclination of the plane, for\r\nno better reason than that such an expression will properly represent it\r\nat the two limiting angles of inclination, since the force is nothing\r\nwhen the plane is horizontal, and equal to the weight when\r\nperpendicular. This again shows how cautious we should be in attributing\r\nthe full knowledge of general principles to these early writers, on\r\naccount of occasional indications of their having employed them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115] Histoire des Mathématiques, vol. i. p. 97.\r\n\r\n[116] De vi Percussionis, Bononiæ, 1667.\r\n\r\n[117] Mec.

For the advantage of those who may think the distinction\r\nworth attending to, we give an illustration of Aristotle's meaning, from\r\na very acute and learned commentator:—\"It (motion) is something more\r\nthan dead capacity; something less than perfect actuality; capacity\r\nroused, and striving to quit its latent character; not the capable\r\nbrass, nor yet the actual statue, but the capacity in energy; that is to\r\nsay, the brass in fusion while it is becoming the statue and is not yet\r\nbecome.\"—\"The bow moves not because it may be bent, nor because it is\r\nbent; but the motion lies between; lies in an imperfect and obscure\r\nunion of the two together; is the actuality (if I may so say) even of\r\ncapacity itself: imperfect and obscure, because such is capacity to\r\nwhich it belongs.\"—Harris, Philosophical Arrangements.\r\n\r\n[123] Lib. iv. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[124] Lib. iv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[125] De Cœlo, lib. i. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[126] Phys. lib. vii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[127] De Cœlo, lib. i. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[128] Phys. lib. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[129] Mechanica.\r\n\r\n[130] Εαν δε εν μηδενι λογῳ φερηται δυο φορας κατα μηδενα χρονον,\r\nαδυνατον ευθειαν ειναι την φοραν.

His manuscript treatises on motion, written about\r\n1590, which are mentioned by Venturi to be in the Ducal library at\r\nFlorence, seem, from the published titles of the chapters, to consist\r\nprincipally of objections to the theory of Aristotle; a few only appear\r\nto enter on a new field of speculation. The 11th, 13th, and 17th\r\nchapters relate to the motion of bodies on variously inclined planes,\r\nand of projectiles. The title of the 14th implies a new theory of\r\naccelerated motion, and the assertion in that of the 16th, that a body\r\nfalling naturally for however great a time would never acquire more than\r\nan assignable degree of velocity, shows that at this early period\r\nGalileo had formed just and accurate notions of the action of a\r\nresisting medium. It is hazardous to conjecture how much he might have\r\nthen acquired of what we should now call more elementary knowledge; a\r\nsafer course will be to trace his progress through existing documents in\r\ntheir chronological order. In 1602 we find Galileo apologizing in a\r\nletter addressed to his early patron the Marchese Guido Ubaldi, for\r\npressing again upon his attention the isochronism of the pendulum, which\r\nUbaldi had rejected as false and impossible. It may not be superfluous\r\nto observe that Galileo's results are not quite accurate, for there is a\r\nperceptible increase in the time occupied by the oscillations in larger\r\narcs; it is therefore probable that he was induced to speak so\r\nconfidently of their perfect equality, from attributing the increase of\r\ntime which he could not avoid remarking to the increased resistance of\r\nthe air during the larger vibrations. The analytical methods then known\r\nwould not permit him to discover the curious fact, that the time of a\r\ntotal vibration is not sensibly altered by this cause, except so far as\r\nit diminishes the extent of the swing, and thus in fact, (paradoxical as\r\nit may sound) renders each oscillation successively more rapid, though\r\nin a very small degree. He does indeed make the same remark, that the\r\nresistance of the air will not affect the time of the oscillation, but\r\nthat assertion was a consequence of his erroneous belief that the time\r\nof vibration in all arcs is the same. Had he been aware of the\r\nvariation, there is no reason to think that he could have perceived that\r\nthis result is not affected by it. In this letter is the first mention\r\nof the theorem, that the times of fall down all the chords drawn from\r\nthe lowest point of a circle are equal; and another, from which Galileo\r\nafterwards deduced the curious result, that it takes less time to fall\r\ndown the curve than down the chord, notwithstanding the latter is the\r\ndirect and shortest course. In conclusion he says, \"Up to this point I\r\ncan go without exceeding the limits of mechanics, but I have not yet\r\nbeen able to demonstrate that all arcs are passed in the same time,\r\nwhich is what I am seeking.\" In 1604 he addressed the following letter\r\nto Sarpi, suggesting the false theory sometimes called Baliani's, who\r\ntook it from Galileo.\r\n\r\n [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A-+\r\n    |\r\n    |\r\n  B-+\r\n    |\r\n    |\r\n  C-+\r\n    |\r\n    |\r\n  D-+ ]\r\n\r\n\"Returning to the subject of motion, in which I was entirely without a\r\nfixed principle, from which to deduce the phenomena I have observed, I\r\nhave hit upon a proposition, which seems natural and likely enough; and\r\nif I take it for granted, I can show that the spaces passed in natural\r\nmotion are in the double proportion of the times, and consequently that\r\nthe spaces passed in equal times are as the odd numbers beginning from\r\nunity, and the rest. The principle is this, that the swiftness of the\r\nmoveable increases in the proportion of its distance from the point\r\nwhence it began to move; as for instance,—if a heavy body drop from A\r\ntowards D, by the line ABCD, I suppose the degree of velocity which it\r\nhas at B to bear to the velocity at C the ratio of AB to AC. I shall be\r\nvery glad if your Reverence will consider this, and tell me your opinion\r\nof it. If we admit this principle, not only, as I have said, shall we\r\ndemonstrate the other conclusions, but we have it in our power to show\r\nthat a body falling naturally, and another projected upwards, pass\r\nthrough the same degrees of velocity. For if the projectile be cast up\r\nfrom D to A, it is clear that at D it has force enough to reach A, and\r\nno farther; and when it has reached C and B, it is equally clear that it\r\nis still joined to a degree of force capable of carrying it to A: thus\r\nit is manifest that the forces at D, C and B decrease in the proportion\r\nof AB, AC, and AD; so that if, in falling, the degrees of velocity\r\nobserve the same proportion, that is true which I have hitherto\r\nmaintained and believed.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no means of knowing how early Galileo discovered the fallacy of\r\nthis reasoning. In his Dialogues on Motion, which contain the correct\r\ntheory, he has put this erroneous supposition in the mouth of Sagredo,\r\non which Salviati remarks, \"Your discourse has so much likelihood in it,\r\nthat our author himself did not deny to me when I proposed it to him,\r\nthat he also had been for some time in the same mistake. But that which\r\nI afterwards extremely wondered at, was to see discovered in four plain\r\nwords, not only the falsity, but the impossibility of a supposition\r\ncarrying with it so much of seeming truth, that although I proposed it\r\nto many, I never met with any one but did freely admit it to be so; and\r\nyet it is as false and impossible as that motion is made in an instant:\r\nfor if the velocities are as the spaces passed, those spaces will be\r\npassed in equal times, and consequently all motion must be\r\ninstantaneous.\" The following manner of putting this reasoning will\r\nperhaps make the conclusion clearer. The velocity at any point is the\r\nspace that would be passed in the next moment of time, if the motion be\r\nsupposed to continue the same as at that point. At the beginning of the\r\ntime, when the body is at rest, the motion is none; and therefore, on\r\nthis theory, the space passed in the next moment is none, and thus it\r\nwill be seen that the body cannot begin to move according to the\r\nsupposed law.\r\n\r\nA curious fact, noticed by Guido Grandi in his commentary on Galileo's\r\nDialogues on Motion, is that this false law of acceleration is precisely\r\nthat which would make a circular arc the shortest line of descent\r\nbetween two given points; and although in general Galileo only declared\r\nthat the fall down the arc is made in less time than down the chord (in\r\nwhich he is quite correct), yet in some places he seems to assert that\r\nthe circular arc is absolutely the shortest line of descent, which is\r\nnot true. It has been thought possible that the law, which on reflection\r\nhe perceived to be impossible, might have originally recommended itself\r\nto him from his perception that it satisfied his prejudice in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nJohn Bernouilli, one of the first mathematicians in Europe at the\r\nbeginning of the last century, has given us a proof that such a reason\r\nmight impose even on a strong understanding, in the following argument\r\nurged by him in favour of Galileo's second and correct theory, that the\r\nspaces vary as the squares of the times. He had been investigating the\r\ncurve of swiftest descent, and found it to be a cycloid, the same curve\r\nin which Huyghens had already proved that all oscillations are made in\r\naccurately equal times. \"I think it,\" says he, \"worthy of remark that\r\nthis identity only occurs on Galileo's supposition, so that this alone\r\nmight lead us to presume it to be the real law of nature. For nature,\r\nwhich always does everything in the very simplest manner, thus makes one\r\nline do double work, whereas on any other supposition, we must have had\r\ntwo lines, one for equal oscillations, the other for the shortest\r\ndescent.\"[140]\r\n\r\nVenturi mentions a letter addressed to Galileo in May 1609 by Luca\r\nValerio, thanking him for his experiments on the descent of bodies on\r\ninclined planes. His method of making these experiments is detailed in\r\nthe Dialogues on Motion:—\"In a rule, or rather plank of wood, about\r\ntwelve yards long, half a yard broad one way, and three inches the\r\nother, we made upon the narrow side or edge a groove of little more than\r\nan inch wide: we cut it very straight, and, to make it very smooth and\r\nsleek, we glued upon it a piece of vellum, polished and smoothed as\r\nexactly as possible, and in that we let fall a very hard, round, and\r\nsmooth brass ball, raising one of the ends of the plank a yard or two at\r\npleasure above the horizontal plane. We observed, in the manner that I\r\nshall tell you presently, the time which it spent in running down, and\r\nrepeated the same observation again and again to assure ourselves of the\r\ntime, in which we never found any difference, no, not so much as the\r\ntenth part of one beat of the pulse. Having made and settled this\r\nexperiment, we let the same ball descend through a fourth part only of\r\nthe length of the groove, and found the measured time to be exactly half\r\nthe former. Continuing our experiments with other portions of the\r\nlength, comparing the fall through the whole with the fall through half,\r\ntwo-thirds, three-fourths, in short, with the fall through any part, we\r\nfound by many hundred experiments that the spaces passed over were as\r\nthe squares of the times, and that this was the case in all inclinations\r\nof the plank; during which, we also remarked that the times of descent,\r\non different inclinations, observe accurately the proportion assigned to\r\nthem farther on, and demonstrated by our author. As to the estimation of\r\nthe time, we hung up a great bucket full of water, which by a very small\r\nhole pierced in the bottom squirted out a fine thread of water, which we\r\ncaught in a small glass during the whole time of the different descents:\r\nthen weighing from time to time, in an exact pair of scales, the\r\nquantity of water caught in this way, the differences and proportions of\r\ntheir weights gave the differences and proportions of the times; and\r\nthis with such exactness that, as I said before, although the\r\nexperiments were repeated again and again, they never differed in any\r\ndegree worth noticing.\" In order to get rid of the friction, Galileo\r\nafterwards substituted experiments with the pendulum; but with all his\r\ncare he erred very widely in his determination of the space through\r\nwhich a body would fall in 1´´, if the resistance of the air and all\r\nother impediments were removed. He fixed it at 4 _braccia_: Mersenne has\r\nengraved the length of the '_braccia_' used by Galileo, in his \"Harmonie\r\nUniverselle,\" from which it appears to be about 23½ English inches, so\r\nthat Galileo's result is rather less than eight feet. Mersenne's own\r\nresult from direct observation was thirteen feet: he also made\r\nexperiments in St. Peter's at Rome, with a pendulum 325 feet long, the\r\nvibrations of which were made in 10´´; from this the fall in 1´´ might\r\nhave been deduced rather more than sixteen feet, which is very close to\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nFrom another letter also written in the early part of 1609, we learn\r\nthat Galileo was then busied with examining the strength and resistance\r\n\"of beams of different sizes and forms, and how much weaker they are in\r\nthe middle than at the ends, and how much greater weight they can\r\nsupport laid along their whole length, than if sustained on a single\r\npoint, and of what form they should be so as to be equally strong\r\nthroughout.\" He was also speculating on the motion of projectiles, and\r\nhad satisfied himself that their motion in a vertical direction is\r\nunaffected by their horizontal velocity; a conclusion which, combined\r\nwith his other experiments, led him afterwards to determine the path of\r\na projectile in a non-resisting medium to be parabolical.\r\n\r\nTartalea is supposed to have been the first to remark that no bullet\r\nmoves in a horizontal line; but his theory beyond this point was very\r\nerroneous, for he supposed the bullet's path through the air to be made\r\nup of an ascending and descending straight line, connected in the middle\r\nby a circular arc.\r\n\r\nThomas Digges, in his treatise on the Newe Science of Great Artillerie,\r\ncame much nearer the truth; for he remarked[141], that \"The bullet\r\nviolentlye throwne out of the peece by the furie of the poulder hath two\r\nmotions: the one violent, which endeuoreth to carry the bullet right out\r\nin his line diagonall, according to the direction of the peece's axis,\r\nfrom whence the violent motion proceedeth; the other naturall in the\r\nbullet itselfe, which endeuoreth still to carrye the same directlye\r\ndowneward by a right line perpendiculare to the horizon, and which dooth\r\nthough insensiblye euen from the beginning by little and little drawe it\r\nfrom that direct and diagonall course.\" And a little farther he observes\r\nthat \"These middle curve arkes of the bullet's circuite, compounded of\r\nthe violent and naturall motions of the bullet, albeit they be indeed\r\nmere helicall, yet have they a very great resemblance of the Arkes\r\nConical. And in randons above 45° they doe much resemble the Hyperbole,\r\nand in all vnder the Ellepsis. But exactlye they neuer accorde, being\r\nindeed Spirall mixte and Helicall.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Digges deserves no greater credit from this latter passage than\r\nthe praise of a sharp and accurate eye, for he does not appear to have\r\nfounded this determination of the form of the curve on any theory of the\r\ndirect fall of bodies; but Galileo's arrival at the same result was\r\npreceded, as we have seen, by a careful examination of the simplest\r\nphenomena into which this compound motion may be resolved. But it is\r\ntime to proceed to the analysis of his \"Dialogues on Motion,\" these\r\npreliminary remarks on their subject matter having been merely intended\r\nto show how long before their publication Galileo was in possession of\r\nthe principal theories contained in them.\r\n\r\nDescartes, in one of his letters to Mersenne, insinuates that Galileo\r\nhad taken many things in these Dialogues from him: the two which he\r\nespecially instances are the isochronism of the pendulum, and the law of\r\nthe spaces varying as the squares of the times.[142] Descartes was born\r\nin 1596: we have shown that Galileo observed the isochronism of the\r\npendulum in 1583, and knew the law of the spaces in 1604, although he\r\nwas then attempting to deduce it from an erroneous principle. As\r\nDescartes on more than one occasion has been made to usurp the credit\r\ndue to Galileo, (in no instance more glaringly so than when he has been\r\nabsurdly styled the forerunner of Newton,) it will not be misplaced to\r\nmention a few of his opinions on these subjects, recorded in his letters\r\nto Mersenne in the collection of his letters just cited:—\"I am\r\nastonished at what you tell me of having found by experiment that bodies\r\nthrown up in the air take neither more nor less time to rise than to\r\nfall again; and you will excuse me if I say that I look upon the\r\nexperiment as a very difficult one to make accurately. This proportion\r\nof increase according to the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, &c., which is in\r\nGalileo, and which I think I wrote to you some time back, cannot be\r\ntrue, as I believe I intimated at the same time, unless we make two or\r\nthree suppositions which are entirely false. One is Galileo's opinion,\r\nthat motion increases gradually from the slowest degree; and the other\r\nis, that the air makes no resistance.\" In a later letter to the same\r\nperson he says, apparently with some uneasiness, \"I have been revising\r\nmy notes on Galileo, in which I have not said expressly, that falling\r\nbodies do not pass through every degree of slowness, but I said that\r\nthis cannot be determined without knowing what weight is; _which comes\r\nto the same thing_. As to your example, I grant that it proves that\r\nevery degree of velocity is infinitely divisible, but not that a falling\r\nbody actually passes through all these divisions.—It is certain that a\r\nstone is not equally disposed to receive a new motion or increase of\r\nvelocity, when it is already moving very quickly, and when it is moving\r\nslowly. But I believe that I am now able to determine in what proportion\r\nthe velocity of a stone increases, not when falling in a vacuum, but in\r\nthis substantial atmosphere.—However I have now got my mind full of\r\nother things, and I cannot amuse myself with hunting this out, _nor is\r\nit a matter of much utility_.\" He afterwards returns once more to the\r\nsame subject:—\"As to what Galileo says, that falling bodies pass\r\nthrough every degree of velocity, I do not believe that it generally\r\nhappens, but I allow it is not impossible that it may happen\r\noccasionally.\" After this the reader will know what value to attach to\r\nthe following assertion by the same Descartes:—\"I see nothing in\r\nGalileo's books to envy him, and hardly any thing which I would own as\r\nmine;\" and then may judge how far Salusbury's blunt declaration is borne\r\nout, \"Where or when did any one appear that durst enter the lists with\r\nour Galileus? save only one bold and unfortunate Frenchman, who yet no\r\nsooner came within the ring but he was hissed out again.\"[143]\r\n\r\nThe principal merit of Descartes must undoubtedly be derived from the\r\ngreat advances he made in what are generally termed Abstract or Pure\r\nMathematics; nor was he slow to point out to Mersenne and his other\r\nfriends the acknowledged inferiority of Galileo to himself in this\r\nrespect. We have not sufficient proof that this difference would have\r\nexisted if Galileo's attention had been equally directed to that object;\r\nthe singular elegance of some of his geometrical constructions indicates\r\ngreat talent for this as well as for his own more favourite\r\nspeculations. But he was far more profitably employed: geometry and pure\r\nmathematics already far outstripped any useful application of their\r\nresults to physical science, and it was the business of Galileo's life\r\nto bring up the latter to the same level. He found abstract theorems\r\nalready demonstrated in sufficient number for his purpose, nor was there\r\noccasion to task his genius in search of new methods of inquiry, till\r\nall was exhausted which could be learned from those already in use. The\r\nresult of his labours was that in the age immediately succeeding\r\nGalileo, the study of nature was no longer in arrear of the abstract\r\ntheories of number and measure; and when the genius of Newton pressed it\r\nforward to a still higher degree of perfection, it became necessary to\r\ndiscover at the same time more powerful instruments of investigation.\r\nThis alternating process has been successfully continued to the present\r\ntime; the analyst acts as the pioneer of the naturalist, so that the\r\nabstract researches, which at first have no value but in the eyes of\r\nthose to whom an elegant formula, in its own beauty, is a source of\r\npleasure as real and as refined as a painting or a statue, are often\r\nfound to furnish the only means for penetrating into the most intricate\r\nand concealed phenomena of natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nDescartes and Delambre agree in suspecting that Galileo preferred the\r\ndialogistic form for his treatises, because it afforded a ready\r\nopportunity for him to praise his own inventions: the reason which he\r\nhimself gave is, the greater facility for introducing new matter and\r\ncollateral inquiries, such as he seldom failed to add each time that he\r\nreperused his work. We shall select in the first place enough to show\r\nthe extent of his knowledge on the principal subject, motion, and shall\r\nthen allude as well as our limits will allow to the various other points\r\nincidentally brought forward.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues are between the same speakers as in the \"System of the\r\nWorld;\" and in the first Simplicio gives Aristotle's proof,[144] that\r\nmotion in a vacuum is impossible, because according to him bodies move\r\nwith velocities in the compound proportion of their weights and the\r\nrarities of the mediums through which they move. And since the density\r\nof a vacuum bears no assignable ratio to that of any medium in which\r\nmotion has been observed, any body which should employ time in moving\r\nthrough the latter, would pass through the same distance in a vacuum\r\ninstantaneously, which is impossible. Salviati replies by denying the\r\naxioms, and asserts that if a cannon ball weighing 200 lbs., and a\r\nmusket ball weighing half a pound, be dropped together from a tower 200\r\nyards high, the former will not anticipate the latter by so much as a\r\nfoot; \"and I would not have you do as some are wont, who fasten upon\r\nsome saying of mine that may want a hair's breadth of the truth, and\r\nunder this hair they seek to hide another man's blunder as big as a\r\ncable. Aristotle says that an iron ball weighing 100 lbs. will fall from\r\nthe height of 100 yards while a weight of one pound falls but one yard:\r\nI say they will reach the ground together. They find the bigger to\r\nanticipate the less by two inches, and under these two inches they seek\r\nto hide Aristotle's 99 yards.\" In the course of his reply to this\r\nargument Salviati formally announces the principle which is the\r\nfoundation of the whole of Galileo's theory of motion, and which must\r\ntherefore be quoted in his own words:—\"A heavy body has by nature an\r\nintrinsic principle of moving towards the common centre of heavy things;\r\nthat is to say, to the centre of our terrestrial globe, with a motion\r\ncontinually accelerated in such manner that in equal times there are\r\nalways equal additions of velocity. This is to be understood as holding\r\ntrue only when all accidental and external impediments are removed,\r\namongst which is one that we cannot obviate, namely, the resistance of\r\nthe medium. This opposes itself, less or more, accordingly as it is to\r\nopen more slowly or hastily to make way for the moveable, which being by\r\nits own nature, as I have said, continually accelerated, consequently\r\nencounters a continually increasing resistance in the medium, until at\r\nlast the velocity reaches that degree, and the resistance that power,\r\nthat they balance each other; all further acceleration is prevented, and\r\nthe moveable continues ever after with an uniform and equable motion.\"\r\nThat such a limiting velocity is not greater than some which may be\r\nexhibited may be proved as Galileo suggested by firing a bullet upwards,\r\nwhich will in its descent strike the ground with less force than it\r\nwould have done if immediately from the mouth of the gun; for he argued\r\nthat the degree of velocity which the air's resistance is capable of\r\ndiminishing must be greater than that which could ever be reached by a\r\nbody falling naturally from rest. \"I do not think the present occasion a\r\nfit one for examining the cause of this acceleration of natural motion,\r\non which the opinions of philosophers are much divided; some referring\r\nit to the approach towards the centre, some to the continual diminution\r\nof that part of the medium remaining to be divided, some to a certain\r\nextrusion of the ambient medium, which uniting again behind the moveable\r\npresses and hurries it forwards. All these fancies, with others of the\r\nlike sort, we might spend our time in examining, and with little to gain\r\nby resolving them. It is enough for our author at present that we\r\nunderstand his object to be the investigation and examination of some\r\nphenomena of a motion so accelerated, (no matter what may be the cause,)\r\nthat the momenta of velocity, from the beginning to move from rest,\r\nincrease in the simple proportion in which the time increases, which is\r\nas much as to say, that in equal times are equal additions of velocity.\r\nAnd if it shall turn out that the phenomena demonstrated on this\r\nsupposition are verified in the motion of falling and naturally\r\naccelerated weights, we may thence conclude that the assumed definition\r\ndoes describe the motion of heavy bodies, and that it is true that their\r\nacceleration varies in the ratio of the time of motion.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Galileo first published these Dialogues on Motion, he was obliged\r\nto rest his demonstrations upon another principle besides, namely, that\r\nthe velocity acquired in falling down all inclined planes of the same\r\nperpendicular height is the same. As this result was derived directly\r\nfrom experiment, and from that only, his theory was so far imperfect\r\ntill he could show its consistency with the above supposed law of\r\nacceleration. When Viviani was studying with Galileo, he expressed his\r\ndissatisfaction at this chasm in the reasoning; the consequence of which\r\nwas, that Galileo, as he lay the same night, sleepless through\r\nindisposition, discovered the proof which he had long sought in vain,\r\nand introduced it into the subsequent editions. The third dialogue is\r\nprincipally taken up with theorems on the direct fall of bodies, their\r\ntimes of descent down differently inclined planes, which in planes of\r\nthe same height he determined to be as the lengths, and with other\r\ninquiries connected with the same subject, such as the straight lines of\r\nshortest descent under different data, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth dialogue is appropriated to projectile motion, determined\r\nupon the principle that the horizontal motion will continue the same as\r\nif there were no vertical motion, and the vertical motion as if there\r\nwere no horizontal motion. \"Let AB represent a horizontal line or plane\r\nplaced on high, on which let a body be carried with an equable motion\r\nfrom A towards B, and the support of the plane being taken away at B,\r\nlet the natural motion downwards due to the body's weight come upon it\r\nin the direction of the perpendicular BN. Moreover let the straight line\r\nBE drawn in the direction AB be taken to represent the flow, or measure,\r\nof the time, on which let any number of equal parts BC, CD, DE, &c. be\r\nmarked at pleasure, and from the points C, D, E, let lines be drawn\r\nparallel to BN; in the first of these let any part CI be taken, and let\r\nDF be taken four times as great as CI, EH nine times as great, and so\r\non, proportionally to the squares of the lines BC, BD, BE, &c., or, as\r\nwe say, in the double proportion of these lines. Now if we suppose that\r\nwhilst by its equable horizontal motion the body moves from B to C, it\r\nalso descends by its weight through CI, at the end of the time denoted\r\nby BC it will be at I. Moreover in the time BD, double of BC, it will\r\nhave fallen four times as far, for in the first part of the Treatise it\r\nhas been shewn that the spaces fallen through by a heavy body vary as\r\nthe squares of the times. Similarly at the end of the time BE, or three\r\ntimes BC, it will have fallen through EH, and will be at H. And it is\r\nplain that the points I, F, H, are in the same parabolical line BIFH.\r\nThe same demonstration will apply if we take any number of equal\r\nparticles of time of whatever duration.\"\r\n\r\nThe curve called here a Parabola by Galileo, is one of those which\r\nresults from cutting straight through a Cone, and therefore is called\r\nalso one of the Conic Sections, the curious properties of which curves\r\nhad drawn the attention of geometricians long before Galileo thus began\r\nto point out their intimate connexion with the phenomena of motion.\r\nAfter the proposition we have just extracted, he proceeds to anticipate\r\nsome objections to the theory, and explains that the course of a\r\nprojectile will not be accurately a parabola for two reasons; partly on\r\naccount of the resistance of the air, and partly because a horizontal\r\nline, or one equidistant from the earth's centre, is not straight, but\r\ncircular. The latter cause of difference will, however, as he says, be\r\ninsensible in all such experiments as we are able to make. The rest of\r\nthe Dialogue is taken up with different constructions for determining\r\nthe circumstances of the motion of projectiles, as their range, greatest\r\nheight, &c.; and it is proved that, with a given force of projection,\r\nthe range will be greatest when a ball is projected at an elevation of\r\n45°, ranges of all angles equally inclined above and below 45°\r\ncorresponding exactly to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting subjects discussed in these dialogues is the\r\nfamous notion of Nature's horror of a vacuum or empty space, which the\r\nold school of philosophy considered as impossible to be obtained.\r\nGalileo's notions of it were very different; for although he still\r\nunadvisedly adhered to the old phrase to denote the resistance\r\nexperienced in endeavouring to separate two smooth surfaces, he was so\r\nfar from looking upon a vacuum as an impossibility, that he has\r\ndescribed an apparatus by which he endeavoured to measure the force\r\nnecessary to produce one. This consisted of a cylinder, into which is\r\ntightly fitted a piston; through the centre of the piston passes a rod\r\nwith a conical valve, which, when drawn down, shuts the aperture\r\nclosely, supporting a basket. The space between the piston and cylinder\r\nbeing filled full of water poured in through the aperture, the valve is\r\nclosed, the vessel reversed, and weights are added till the piston is\r\ndrawn forcibly downwards. Galileo concluded that the weight of the\r\npiston, rod, and added weights, would be the measure of the force of\r\nresistance to the vacuum which he supposed would take place between the\r\npiston and lower surface of the water. The defects in this apparatus for\r\nthe purpose intended are of no consequence, so far as regards the\r\npresent argument, and it is perhaps needless to observe that he was\r\nmistaken in supposing the water would not descend with the piston. This\r\nexperiment occasions a remark from Sagredo, that he had observed that a\r\nlifting-pump would not work when the water in the cistern had sunk to\r\nthe depth of thirty-five feet below the valve; that he thought the pump\r\nwas injured, and sent for the maker of it, who assured him that no pump\r\nupon that construction would lift water from so great a depth. This\r\nstory is sometimes told of Galileo, as if he had said sneeringly on this\r\noccasion that Nature's horror of a vacuum does not extend beyond\r\nthirty-five feet; but it is very plain that if he had made such an\r\nobservation, it would have been seriously; and in fact by such a\r\nlimitation he deprived the notion of the principal part of its\r\nabsurdity. He evidently had adopted the common notion of suction, for he\r\ncompares the column of water to a rod of metal suspended from its upper\r\nend, which may be lengthened till it breaks with its own weight. It is\r\ncertainly very extraordinary that he failed to observe how simply these\r\nphenomena may be explained by a reference to the weight of the elastic\r\natmosphere, which he was perfectly well acquainted with, and endeavoured\r\nby the following ingenious experiment to determine:—\"Take a large glass\r\nflask with a bent neck, and round its mouth tie a leathern pipe with a\r\nvalve in it, through which water may be forced into the flask with a\r\nsyringe without suffering any air to escape, so that it will be\r\ncompressed within the bottle. It will be found difficult to force in\r\nmore than about three-fourths of what the flask will hold, which must be\r\ncarefully weighed. The valve must then be opened, and just so much air\r\nwill rush out as would in its natural density occupy the space now\r\nfilled by the water. Weigh the vessel again; the difference will show\r\nthe weight of that quantity of air.\"[145] By these means, which the\r\nmodern experimentalist will see were scarcely capable of much accuracy,\r\nGalileo found that air was four hundred times lighter than water,\r\ninstead of ten times, which was the proportion fixed on by Aristotle.\r\nThe real proportion is about 830 times.\r\n\r\nThe true theory of the rise of water in a lifting-pump is commonly dated\r\nfrom Torricelli's famous experiment with a column of mercury, in 1644,\r\nwhen he found that the greatest height at which it would stand is\r\nfourteen times less than the height at which water will stand, which is\r\nexactly the proportion of weight between water and mercury. The\r\nfollowing curious letter from Baliani, in 1630, shows that the original\r\nmerit of suggesting the real cause belongs to him, and renders it still\r\nmore unaccountable that Galileo, to whom it was addressed, should not at\r\nonce have adopted the same view of the subject:—\"I have believed that a\r\nvacuum may exist naturally ever since I knew that the air has sensible\r\nweight, and that you taught me in one of your letters how to find its\r\nweight exactly, though I have not yet succeeded with that experiment.\r\nFrom that moment I took up the notion that it is not repugnant to the\r\nnature of things that there should be a vacuum, but merely that it is\r\ndifficult to produce. To explain myself more clearly: if we allow that\r\nthe air has weight, there is no difference between air and water except\r\nin degree. At the bottom of the sea the weight of the water above me\r\ncompresses everything round my body, and it strikes me that the same\r\nthing must happen in the air, we being placed at the bottom of its\r\nimmensity; we do not feel its weight, nor the compression round us,\r\nbecause our bodies are made capable of supporting it. But if we were in\r\na vacuum, then the weight of the air above our heads would be felt. It\r\nwould be felt very great, but not infinite, and therefore determinable,\r\nand it might be overcome by a force proportioned to it. In fact I\r\nestimate it to be such that, to make a vacuum, I believe we require a\r\nforce greater than that of a column of water thirty feet high.\"[146]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis subject is introduced by some observations on the force of\r\ncohesion, Galileo seeming to be of opinion that, although it cannot be\r\nadequately accounted for by \"the great and principal resistance to a\r\nvacuum, yet that perhaps a sufficient cause may be found by considering\r\nevery body as composed of very minute particles, between every two of\r\nwhich is exerted a similar resistance.\" This remark serves to lead to a\r\ndiscussion on indivisibles and infinite quantities, of which we shall\r\nmerely extract what Galileo gives as a curious paradox suggested in the\r\ncourse of it. He supposes a basin to be formed by scooping a hemisphere\r\nout of a cylinder, and a cone to be taken of the same depth and base as\r\nthe hemisphere. It is easy to show, if the cone and scooped cylinder be\r\nboth supposed to be cut by the same plane, parallel to the one on which\r\nboth stand, that the area of the ring CDEF thus discovered in the\r\ncylinder is equal to the area of the corresponding circular section AB\r\nof the cone, wherever the cutting plane is supposed to be.[147] He then\r\nproceeds with these remarkable words:—\"If we raise the plane higher and\r\nhigher, one of these areas terminates in the circumference of a circle,\r\nand the other in a point, for such are the upper rim of the basin and\r\nthe top of the cone. Now since in the diminution of the two areas they\r\nto the very last maintain their equality to one another, it is in my\r\nthoughts proper to say that the highest and ultimate terms[148] of such\r\ndiminutions are equal, and not one infinitely bigger than the other. It\r\nseems therefore that the circumference of a large circle may be said to\r\nbe equal to one single point. And why may not these be called equal if\r\nthey be the last remainders and vestiges left by equal magnitudes[149]?\"\r\n\r\nWe think no one can refuse to admit the probability, that Newton may\r\nhave found in such passages as these the first germ of the idea of his\r\nprime and ultimate ratios, which afterwards became in his hands an\r\ninstrument of such power. As to the paradoxical result, Descartes\r\nundoubtedly has given the true answer to it in saying that it only\r\nproves that the line is not a greater area than the point is. Whilst on\r\nthis subject, it may not be uninteresting to remark that something\r\nsimilar to the doctrine of fluxions seems to have been lying dormant in\r\nthe minds of the mathematicians of Galileo's era, for Inchoffer\r\nillustrates his argument in the treatise we have already mentioned, that\r\nthe Copernicans may deduce some true results from what he terms their\r\nabsurd hypothesis, by observing, that mathematicians may deduce the\r\ntruth that a line is length without breadth, from the false and\r\nphysically impossible supposition that a point flows, and that a line is\r\nthe fluxion of a point.[150]\r\n\r\nA suggestion that perhaps fire dissolves bodies by insinuating itself\r\nbetween their minute particles, brings on the subject of the violent\r\neffects of heat and light; on which Sagredo inquires, whether we are to\r\ntake for granted that the effect of light does or does not require time.\r\nSimplicio is ready with an answer, that the discharge of artillery\r\nproves the transmission of light to be instantaneous, to which Sagredo\r\ncautiously replies, that nothing can be gathered from that experiment\r\nexcept that light travels more swiftly than sound; nor can we draw any\r\ndecisive conclusion from the rising of the sun. \"Who can assure us that\r\nhe is not in the horizon before his rays reach our sight?\" Salviati then\r\nmentions an experiment by which he endeavoured to examine this question.\r\nTwo observers are each to be furnished with a lantern: as soon as the\r\nfirst shades his light, the second is to discover his, and this is to be\r\nrepeated at a short distance till the observers are perfect in the\r\npractice. The same thing is to be tried at the distance of several\r\nmiles, and if the first observer perceive any delay between shading his\r\nown light and the appearance of his companion's, it is to be attributed\r\nto the time taken by the light in traversing twice the distance between\r\nthem. He allows that he could discover no perceptible interval at the\r\ndistance of a mile, at which he had tried the experiment, but recommends\r\nthat with the help of a telescope it should be tried at much greater\r\ndistances. Sir Kenelm Digby remarks on this passage: \"It may be objected\r\n(if there be some observable tardity in the motion of light) that the\r\nsunne would never be truly in that place in which unto our eyes he\r\nappeareth to be; because that it being seene by means of the light which\r\nissueth from it, if that light required time to move in, the sunne\r\n(whose motion is so swifte) would be removed from the place where the\r\nlight left it, before it could be with us to give tidings of him. To\r\nthis I answer, allowing peradventure that it may be so, who knoweth the\r\ncontrary? Or what inconvenience would follow if it be admitted[151]?\"\r\n\r\nThe principal thing remaining to be noticed is the application of the\r\ntheory of the pendulum to musical concords and dissonances, which are\r\nexplained, in the same manner as by Kepler in his \"Harmonices Mundi,\" to\r\nresult from the concurrence or opposition of vibrations in the air\r\nstriking upon the drum of the ear. It is suggested that these vibrations\r\nmay be made manifest by rubbing the finger round a glass set in a large\r\nvessel of water; \"and if by pressure the note is suddenly made to rise\r\nto the octave above, every one of the undulations which will be seen\r\nregularly spreading round the glass, will suddenly split into two,\r\nproving that the vibrations that occasion the octave are double those\r\nbelonging to the simple note.\" Galileo then describes a method he\r\ndiscovered by accident of measuring the length of these waves more\r\naccurately than can be done in the agitated water. He was scraping a\r\nbrass plate with an iron chisel, to take out some spots, and moving the\r\ntool rapidly upon the plate, he occasionally heard a hissing and\r\nwhistling sound, very shrill and audible, and whenever this occurred,\r\nand then only, he observed the light dust on the plate to arrange itself\r\nin a long row of small parallel streaks equidistant from each other. In\r\nrepeated experiments he produced different tones by scraping with\r\ngreater or less velocity, and remarked that the streaks produced by the\r\nacute sounds stood closer together than those from the low notes. Among\r\nthe sounds produced were two, which by comparison with a viol he\r\nascertained to differ by an exact fifth; and measuring the spaces\r\noccupied by the streaks in both experiments, he found thirty of the one\r\nequal to forty-five of the other, which is exactly the known proportion\r\nof the lengths of strings of the same material which sound a fifth to\r\neach other.[152]\r\n\r\nSalviati also remarks, that if the material be not the same, as for\r\ninstance if it be required to sound an octave to a note on catgut, on a\r\nwire of the same length, the weight of the wire must be made four times\r\nas great, and so for other intervals. \"The immediate cause of the forms\r\nof musical intervals is neither the length, the tension, nor the\r\nthickness, but the proportion of the numbers of the undulations of the\r\nair which strike upon the drum of the ear, and make it vibrate in the\r\nsame intervals. Hence we may gather a plausible reason of the different\r\nsensations occasioned to us by different couples of sounds, of which we\r\nhear some with great pleasure, some with less, and call them accordingly\r\nconcords, more or less perfect, whilst some excite in us great\r\ndissatisfaction, and are called discords. The disagreeable sensation\r\nbelonging to the latter probably arises from the disorderly manner in\r\nwhich the vibrations strike the drum of the ear; so that for instance a\r\nmost cruel discord would be produced by sounding together two strings,\r\nof which the lengths are to each other as the side and diagonal of a\r\nsquare, which is the discord of the false fifth. On the contrary,\r\nagreeable consonances will result from those strings of which the\r\nnumbers of vibrations made in the same time are commensurable, \"to the\r\nend that the cartilage of the drum may not undergo the incessant torture\r\nof a double inflexion from the disagreeing percussions.\" Something\r\nsimilar may be exhibited to the eye by hanging up pendulums of different\r\nlengths: \"if these be proportioned so that the times of their vibrations\r\ncorrespond with those of the musical concords, the eye will observe with\r\npleasure their crossings and interweavings still recurring at\r\nappreciable intervals; but if the times of vibration be incommensurate,\r\nthe eye will be wearied and worn out with following them.\"\r\n\r\nThe second dialogue is occupied entirely with an investigation of the\r\nstrength of beams, a subject which does not appear to have been examined\r\nby any one before Galileo beyond Aristotle's remark, that long beams are\r\nweaker, because they are at once the weight, the lever, and the fulcrum;\r\nand it is in the development of this observation that the whole theory\r\nconsists. The principle assumed by Galileo as the basis of his inquiries\r\nis, that the force of cohesion with which a beam resists a cross\r\nfracture in any section may all be considered as acting at the centre of\r\ngravity of the section, and that it breaks always at the lowest point:\r\nfrom this he deduced that the effect of the weight of a prismatic beam\r\nin overcoming the resistance of one end by which it is fastened to a\r\nwall, varies directly as the square of the length, and inversely as the\r\nside of the base. From this it immediately follows, that if for instance\r\nthe bone of a large animal be three times as long as the corresponding\r\none in a smaller beast, it must be nine times as thick to have the same\r\nstrength, provided we suppose in both cases that the materials are of\r\nthe same consistence. An elegant result which Galileo also deduced from\r\nthis theory, is that the form of such a beam, to be equally strong in\r\nevery part, should be that of a parabolical prism, the vertex of the\r\nparabola being the farthest removed from the wall. As an easy mode of\r\ndescribing the parabolic curve for this purpose, he recommends tracing\r\nthe line in which a heavy flexible string hangs. This curve is not an\r\naccurate parabola: it is now called a catenary; but it is plain from the\r\ndescription of it in the fourth dialogue, that Galileo was perfectly\r\naware that this construction is only approximately true. In the same\r\nplace he makes the remark, which to many is so paradoxical, that no\r\nforce, however great, exerted in a horizontal direction, can stretch a\r\nheavy thread, however slender, into an accurately straight line.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and sixth dialogues were left unfinished, and annexed to the\r\nformer ones by Viviani after Galileo's death: the fragment of the fifth,\r\nwhich is on the subject of Euclid's Definition of Ratio, was at first\r\nintended to have formed a part of the third, and followed the first\r\nproposition on equable motion: the sixth was intended to have embodied\r\nGalileo's researches on the nature and laws of Percussion, on which he\r\nwas employed at the time of his death. Considering these solely as\r\nfragments, we shall not here make any extracts from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[140] Joh.

Perhaps he suspected something of the private intrigue which\r\nthwarted his former expectations from the Spanish government, and this\r\nmay have induced him on the present occasion to negotiate the matter\r\nwithout applying for Ferdinand's assistance and recommendation.\r\nAccordingly he addressed himself to Lorenz Real, who had been Governor\r\nGeneral of the Dutch possessions in India, freely and unconditionally\r\noffering the use of his theory to the States General of Holland. Not\r\nlong before, his opinion had been requested by the commissioners\r\nappointed at Paris to examine and report on the practicability of\r\nanother method proposed by Morin,[153] which consisted in observing the\r\ndistance of the moon from a known star. Morin was a French philosopher,\r\nprincipally known as an astrologer and zealous Anti-Copernican; but his\r\nname deserves to be recorded as undoubtedly one of the first to\r\nrecommend a method, which, under the name of a Lunar distance, is now in\r\nuniversal practice.\r\n\r\nThe monthly motion of the moon is so rapid, that her distance from a\r\ngiven star sensibly varies in a few minutes even to the unassisted eye;\r\nand with the aid of the telescope, we can of course appreciate the\r\nchange more accurately. Morin proposed that the distances of the moon\r\nfrom a number of fixed stars lying near her path in the heavens should\r\nbe beforehand calculated and registered for every day in the year, at a\r\ncertain hour, in the place from which the longitudes were to be\r\nreckoned, as for instance at Paris. Just as in the case of the eclipses\r\nof Jupiter's satellites, the observer, when he saw that the moon had\r\narrived at the registered distance, would know the hour at Paris: he\r\nmight also make allowance for intermediate distances. Observing at the\r\nsame instant the hour on board his ship, the difference between the two\r\nwould show his position in regard of longitude. In using this method as\r\nit is now practised, several modifications are to be attended to,\r\nwithout which it would be wholly useless, in consequence of the\r\nrefraction of the atmosphere, and the proximity of the moon to the\r\nearth. Owing to the latter cause, if two spectators should at the same\r\ninstant of time, but in different places, measure the distance of the\r\nmoon in the East, from a star still more to the eastward, it would\r\nappear greater to the more easterly spectator than to the other\r\nobserver, who as seen from the star would be standing more directly\r\nbehind the moon. The mode of allowing for these alterations is taught by\r\ntrigonometry and astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe success of this method depends altogether upon the exact knowledge\r\nwhich we now have of the moon's course, and till that knowledge was\r\nperfected it would have been found altogether illusory. Such in fact was\r\nthe judgment which Galileo pronounced upon it. \"As to Morin's book on\r\nthe method of finding the longitude by means of the moon's motion, I say\r\nfreely that I conceive this idea to be as accurate in theory, as\r\nfallacious and impossible in practice. I am sure that neither you nor\r\nany one of the other four gentlemen can doubt the possibility of finding\r\nthe difference of longitude between two meridians by means of the moon's\r\nmotion, provided we are sure of the following requisites: First, an\r\nEphemeris of the moon's motion exactly calculated for the first meridian\r\nfrom which the others are to be reckoned; secondly, exact instruments,\r\nand convenient to handle, in taking the distance between the moon and a\r\nfixed star; thirdly, great practical skill in the observer; fourthly,\r\nnot less accuracy in the scientific calculations, and astronomical\r\ncomputations; fifthly, very perfect clocks to number the hours, or other\r\nmeans of knowing them exactly, &c. Supposing, I say, all these elements\r\nfree from error, the longitude will be accurately found; but I reckon it\r\nmore easy and likely to err in all of these together, than to be\r\npractically right in one alone. Morin ought to require his judges to\r\nassign, at their pleasure, eight or ten moments of different nights\r\nduring four or six months to come, and pledge himself to predict and\r\nassign by his calculations the distances of the moon at those determined\r\ninstants from some star which would then be near her. If it is found\r\nthat the distances assigned by him agree with those which the quadrant\r\nor sextant[154] will actually show, the judges would be satisfied of his\r\nsuccess, or rather of the truth of the matter, and nothing would remain\r\nbut to show that his operations were such as could be performed by men\r\nof moderate skill, and also practicable at sea as well as on land. I\r\nincline much to think that an experiment of this kind would do much\r\ntowards abating the opinion and conceit which Morin has of himself,\r\nwhich appears to me so lofty, that I should consider myself the eighth\r\nsage, if I knew the half of what Morin presumes to know.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Galileo was biassed by a predilection for his own\r\nmethod, on which he had expended so much time and labour; but the\r\nobjections which he raises against Morin's proposal in the foregoing\r\nletter are no other than those to which at that period it was\r\nundoubtedly open. With regard to his own, he had already, in 1612, given\r\na rough prediction of the course of Jupiter's satellites, which had been\r\nfound to agree tolerably well with subsequent observations; and since\r\nthat time, amid all his other employments, he had almost\r\nunintermittingly during twenty-four years continued his observations,\r\nfor the sake of bringing the tables of their motions to as high a state\r\nof perfection as possible. This was the point to which the inquiries of\r\nthe States in their answer to Galileo's frank proposal were principally\r\ndirected. They immediately appointed commissioners to communicate with\r\nhim, and report the various points on which they required information.\r\nThey also sent him a golden chain, and assured him that in the case of\r\nthe design proving successful, he should have no cause to complain of\r\ntheir want of gratitude and generosity. The commissioners immediately\r\ncommenced an active correspondence with him, in the course of which he\r\nentered into more minute details with regard to the methods by which he\r\nproposed to obviate the practical difficulties of the necessary\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noticing that the secretary to the Prince of Orange, who was\r\nmainly instrumental in forming this commission, was Constantine\r\nHuyghens, father of the celebrated mathematician of that name, of whom\r\nit has been said that he seemed destined to complete the discoveries of\r\nGalileo; and it is not a little remarkable, that Huyghens nowhere in his\r\npublished works makes any allusion to this connexion between his father\r\nand Galileo, not even during the discussion that arose some years later\r\non the subject of the pendulum clock, which must necessarily have forced\r\nit upon his recollection.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch commissioners had chosen one of their number to go into Italy\r\nfor the purpose of communicating personally with Galileo, but he\r\ndiscouraged this scheme, from a fear of its giving umbrage at Rome. The\r\ncorrespondence being carried on at so great a distance necessarily\r\nexperienced many tedious delays, till in the very midst of Galileo's\r\nlabours to complete his tables, he was seized with the blindness which\r\nwe have already mentioned. He then resolved to place all the papers\r\ncontaining his observations and calculations for this purpose in the\r\nhands of Renieri, a former pupil of his, and then professor of\r\nmathematics at Pisa, who undertook to finish and to forward them into\r\nHolland. Before this was done, a new delay was occasioned by the deaths\r\nwhich speedily followed each other of every one of the four\r\ncommissioners; and for two or three years the correspondence with\r\nHolland was entirely interrupted. Constantine Huyghens, who was capable\r\nof appreciating the value of the scheme, succeeded after some trouble in\r\nrenewing it, but only just before the death of Galileo himself, by which\r\nof course it was a second time broken off; and to complete the singular\r\nseries of obstacles by which the trial of this method was impeded, just\r\nas Renieri, by order of the Duke of Tuscany, was about to publish the\r\nephemeris and tables which Galileo had entrusted to him, and which the\r\nDuke told Viviani he had seen in his possession, he also was attacked\r\nwith a mortal malady; and upon his death the manuscripts were nowhere to\r\nbe found, nor has it since been discovered what became of them. Montucla\r\nhas intimated his suspicions that Renieri himself destroyed them, from a\r\nconsciousness that they were insufficient for the purpose to which it\r\nwas intended to apply them; a bold conjecture, and one which ought to\r\nrest upon something more than mere surmise: for although it may be\r\nconsidered certain, that the practical value of these tables would be\r\nvery inconsiderable in the present advanced state of knowledge, yet it\r\nis nearly as sure that they were unique at that time, and Renieri was\r\naware of the value which Galileo himself had set upon them, and should\r\nnot be lightly accused of betraying his trust in so gross a manner. In\r\n1665, Borelli calculated the places of the satellites for every day in\r\nthe ensuing year, which he professed to have deduced (by desire of the\r\nGrand Duke) from Galileo's tables;[155] but he does not say whether or\r\nnot these tables were the same that had been in Renieri's possession.\r\n\r\nWe have delayed till this opportunity to examine how far the invention\r\nof the pendulum clock belongs to Galileo. It has been asserted that the\r\nisochronism of the pendulum had been noticed by Leonardo da Vinci, but\r\nthe passage on which this assertion is founded (as translated from his\r\nmanuscripts by Venturi) scarcely warrants this conclusion. \"A rod which\r\nengages itself in the opposite teeth of a spur-wheel can act like the\r\narm of the balance in clocks, that is to say, it will act alternately,\r\nfirst on one side of the wheel, then on the opposite one, without\r\ninterruption.\" If Da Vinci had constructed a clock on this principle,\r\nand recognized the superiority of the pendulum over the old balance, he\r\nwould surely have done more than merely mention it as affording an\r\nunintermitted motion \"like the arm of the balance.\" The use of the\r\nbalance is supposed to have been introduced at least as early as the\r\nfourteenth century. Venturi mentions the drawing and description of a\r\nclock in one of the manuscripts of the King's Library at Paris, dated\r\nabout the middle of the fifteenth century, which as he says nearly\r\nresembles a modern watch. The balance is there called \"The circle\r\nfastened to the stem of the pallets, and moved by the force with\r\nit.\"[156] In that singularly wild and extravagant book, entitled \"A\r\nHistory of both Worlds,\" by Robert Flud, are given two drawings of the\r\nwheel-work of the clocks and watches in use before the application of\r\nthe pendulum. An inspection of them will show how little remained to be\r\ndone when the isochronism of the pendulum was discovered. _Fig. 1._\r\nrepresents \"the large clocks moved by a weight, such as are put up in\r\nchurches and turrets; _fig. 2._ the small ones moved by a spring, such\r\nas are worn round the neck, or placed on a shelf or table. The use of\r\nthe chain is to equalize the spring, which is strongest at the beginning\r\nof its motion.\"[157] This contrivance of the chain is mentioned by\r\nCardan, in 1570, and is probably still older. In both figures the name\r\ngiven to the cross bar, with the weight attached to it, is \"the time or\r\nbalance (_tempus seu libratio_) by which the motion is equalized.\" The\r\nmanner in which Huyghens first applied the pendulum is shown in _fig.\r\n3._[158] The action in the old clocks of the balance, or _rake_, as it\r\nwas also called, was by checking the motion of the descending weight\r\ntill its inertia was overcome; it was then forced round till the\r\nopposite pallet engaged in the toothed wheel. The balance was thus\r\nsuddenly and forcibly reduced to a state of rest, and again set in\r\nmotion in the opposite direction. It will be observed that these\r\nbalances wanted the spiral spring introduced in all modern watches,\r\nwhich has a property of isochronism similar to that of the pendulum.\r\nHooke is generally named as the discoverer of this property of springs,\r\nand as the author of its application to the improvement of watches, but\r\nthe invention is disputed with him by Huyghens. Lahire asserts[159] that\r\nthe isochronism of springs was communicated to Huyghens at Paris by\r\nHautefeuille, and that this was the reason why Huyghens failed to obtain\r\nthe patent he solicited for the construction of spring watches. A great\r\nnumber of curious contrivances at this early period in the history of\r\nHorology, may be seen in Schott's Magia Naturæ, published at Nuremberg\r\nin 1664.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2. Fig. 1. Fig. 3._]\r\n\r\nGalileo was early convinced of the importance of his pendulum to the\r\naccuracy of astronomical observations; but the progress of invention is\r\nsuch that the steps which on looking back seem the easiest to make, are\r\noften those which are the longest delayed. Galileo recognized the\r\nprinciple of the isochronism of the pendulum, and recommended it as a\r\nmeasurer of time in 1583; yet fifty years later, although constantly\r\nusing it, he had not devised a more convenient method of doing so, than\r\nis contained in the following description taken from his \"Astronomical\r\nOperations.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very exact time-measurer for minute intervals of time, is a heavy\r\npendulum of any size hanged by a fine thread, which, if removed from the\r\nperpendicular and allowed to swing freely, always completes its\r\nvibrations, be they great or small, in exactly the same time.\"[160]\r\n\r\nThe mode of finding exactly by means of this the quantity of any time\r\nreduced to hours, minutes, seconds, &c., which are the divisions\r\ncommonly used among astronomers, is this:—\"Fit up a pendulum of any\r\nlength, as for instance about a foot long, and count patiently (only for\r\nonce) the number of vibrations during a natural day. Our object will be\r\nattained if we know the exact revolution of the natural day. The\r\nobserver must then fix a telescope in the direction of any star, and\r\ncontinue to watch it till it disappears from the field of view. At that\r\ninstant he must begin to count the vibrations of the pendulum,\r\ncontinuing all night and the following day till the return of the same\r\nstar within the field of view of the telescope, and its second\r\ndisappearance, as on the first night. Bearing in recollection the total\r\nnumber of vibrations thus made in twenty-four hours, the time\r\ncorresponding to any other number of vibrations will be immediately\r\ngiven by the Golden Rule.\"\r\n\r\nA second extract out of Galileo's Dutch correspondence, in 1637, will\r\nshow the extent of his improvements at that time:—\"I come now to the\r\nsecond contrivance for increasing immensely the exactness of\r\nastronomical observations. I allude to my time-measurer, the precision\r\nof which is so great, and such, that it will give the exact quantity of\r\nhours, minutes, seconds, and even thirds, if their recurrence could be\r\ncounted; and its constancy is such that two, four, or six such\r\ninstruments will go on together so equably that one will not differ from\r\nanother so much as the beat of a pulse, not only in an hour, but even in\r\na day or a month.\"—\"I do not make use of a weight hanging by a thread,\r\nbut a heavy and solid pendulum, made for instance of brass or copper, in\r\nthe shape of a circular sector of twelve or fifteen degrees, the radius\r\nof which may be two or three palms, and the greater it is the less\r\ntrouble will there be in attending it. This sector, such as I have\r\ndescribed, I make thickest in the middle radius, tapering gradually\r\ntowards the edges, where I terminate it in a tolerably sharp line, to\r\nobviate as much as possible the resistance of the air, which is the sole\r\ncause of its retardation.\"—[These last words deserve notice, because,\r\nin a previous discussion, Galileo had observed that the parts of the\r\npendulum nearest the point of suspension have a tendency to vibrate\r\nquicker than those at the other end, and seems to have thought\r\nerroneously that the stoppage of the pendulum is partly to be attributed\r\nto this cause.]—\"This is pierced in the centre, through which is passed\r\nan iron bar shaped like those on which steelyards hang, terminated below\r\nin an angle, and placed on two bronze supports, that they may wear away\r\nless during a long motion of the sector. If the sector (when accurately\r\nbalanced) be removed several degrees from its perpendicular position, it\r\nwill continue a reciprocal motion through a very great number of\r\nvibrations before it will stop; and in order that it may continue its\r\nmotion as long as is wanted, the attendant must occasionally give it a\r\nsmart push, to carry it back to large vibrations.\" Galileo then\r\ndescribes as before the method of counting the vibrations in the course\r\nof a day, and gives the rule that the lengths of two similar pendulums\r\nwill have the same proportion as the squares of their times of\r\nvibration. He then continues: \"Now to save the fatigue of the assistant\r\nin continually counting the vibrations, this is a convenient\r\ncontrivance: A very small and delicate needle extends out from the\r\nmiddle of the circumference of the sector, which in passing strikes a\r\nrod fixed at one end; this rod rests upon the teeth of a wheel as light\r\nas paper, placed in a horizontal plane near the pendulum, having round\r\nit teeth cut like those of a saw, that is to say, with one side of each\r\ntooth perpendicular to the rim of the wheel and the other inclined\r\nobliquely. The rod striking against the perpendicular side of the tooth\r\nmoves it, but as the same rod returns against the oblique side, it does\r\nnot move it the contrary way, but slips over it and falls at the foot of\r\nthe following tooth, so that the motion of the wheel will be always in\r\nthe same direction. And by counting the teeth you may see at will the\r\nnumber of teeth passed, and consequently the number of vibrations and of\r\nparticles of time elapsed. You may also fit to the axis of this first\r\nwheel a second, with a small number of teeth, touching another greater\r\ntoothed wheel, &c. But it is superfluous to point out this to you, who\r\nhave by you men very ingenious and well skilled in making clocks and\r\nother admirable machines; and on this new principle, that the pendulum\r\nmakes its great and small vibrations in the same time exactly, they will\r\ninvent contrivances more subtle than any I can suggest; and as the error\r\nof clocks consists principally in the disability of workmen hitherto to\r\nadjust what we call the balance of the clock, so that it may vibrate\r\nregularly, my very simple pendulum, which is not liable to any\r\nalteration, affords a mean of maintaining the measures of time always\r\nequal.\" The contrivance thus described would be somewhat similar to the\r\nannexed representation, but it is almost certain that no such instrument\r\nwas actually constructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that Galileo greatly overrated the accuracy of his\r\ntimekeeper; and in asserting so positively that which he had certainly\r\nnot experienced, he seems to depart from his own principles of\r\nphilosophizing. It will be remarked that in this passage he still is of\r\nthe erroneous opinion, that all the vibrations great or small of the\r\nsame pendulum take exactly the same time; and we have not been able to\r\nfind any trace of his having ever held a different opinion, unless\r\nperhaps in the Dialogues, where he says, \"If the vibrations are not\r\nexactly equal, they are at least insensibly different.\" This is very\r\nmuch at variance with the statement in the Memoirs of the Academia del\r\nCimento, edited by their secretary Magalotti, on the credit of which\r\nGalileo's claim to the pendulum-clock chiefly rests. It is there said\r\nthat experience shows that the smallest vibrations are rather the\r\nquickest, \"as Galileo announced after the observation, which in 1583 he\r\nwas the first to make of their approximate equality.\" It is not possible\r\nimmediately in connexion with so glaring a misstatement, to give\r\nimplicit credence to the assertion in the next sentence, that \"_to\r\nobviate this inconvenience_\" Galileo was the first to contrive a clock,\r\nconstructed in 1649, by his son Vincenzo, in which, by the action of a\r\nweight or spring, the pendulum was constrained to move always from the\r\nsame height. Indeed it appears as if Magalotti did not always tell this\r\nstory in the same manner, for he is referred to as the author of the\r\naccount given by Becher, \"that Galileo himself made a pendulum-clock one\r\nof which was sent to Holland,\" plainly insinuating that Huyghens was a\r\nmere copyist.[161] These two accounts therefore serve to invalidate each\r\nother's credibility. Tiraboschi[162] asserts that, at the time he wrote,\r\nthe mathematical professor at Pisa was in possession of the identical\r\nclock constructed by Treffler under Vincenzo's directions; and quotes a\r\nletter from Campani, to whom it was shown by Ferdinand, \"old, rusty, and\r\nunfinished as Galileo's son made it before 1649.\" Viviani on the other\r\nhand says that Treffler constructed this same clock some time after\r\nVincenzo's death (which happened in 1649), on a different principle from\r\nVincenzo's ideas, although he says distinctly that he heard Galileo\r\ndescribe an application of the pendulum to a clock similar to Huyghens'\r\ncontrivance. Campani did not actually see this clock till 1659, which\r\nwas three years after Huyghens' invention, so that perhaps Huyghens was\r\ntoo easily satisfied when, on occasion of the answer which Ferdinand\r\nsent to his complaints of the Memorie del Cimento he wrote to Bouillaud,\r\n\"I must however believe, since such a prince assures me, that Galileo\r\nhad this idea before me.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance almost amounting to a proof that it was an\r\nafterthought to attribute the merit of constructing the pendulum-clock\r\nto Galileo, for on the reverse of a medal struck by Viviani, and\r\ninscribed \"to the memory of his excellent instructor,\"[163] is a rude\r\nexhibition of the principal objects to which Galileo's attention was\r\ndirected. The pendulum is represented simply by a weight attached to a\r\nstring hanging on the face of a rock. It is probable that, in a design\r\nexpressly intended to commemorate Galileo's inventions, Viviani would\r\nhave introduced the timekeeper in the most perfect form to which it had\r\nbeen brought by him. Riccioli,[164] whose industry was unwearied in\r\ncollecting every fact and argument which related in any way to the\r\nastronomical and mechanical knowledge and opinions of his time,\r\nexpressly recommends swinging a pendulum, or perpendicular as it was\r\noften called (only a few years before Huyghens' publication), as much\r\nmore accurate _than any clock_.[165] Join to all these arguments\r\nHuyghens' positive assertion, that if Galileo had conceived any such\r\nidea, he at least was entirely ignorant of it,[166] and no doubt can\r\nremain that the merit of the original invention (such as it was) rests\r\nentirely with Huyghens. The step indeed seems simple enough for a less\r\ngenius than his: for the property of the pendulum was known, and the\r\nconversion of a rotatory into a reciprocating motion was known; but the\r\nconnexion of the one with the other having been so long delayed, we must\r\nsuppose that difficulties existed where we are not now able to perceive\r\nthem, for Huyghens' improvement was received with universal admiration.\r\n\r\nThere may be many who will consider the pendulum as undeserving so long\r\na discussion; who do not know or remember that the telescope itself has\r\nhardly done more for the precision of astronomical observations than\r\nthis simple instrument, not to mention the invaluable convenience of an\r\nuniform and accurate timekeeper in the daily intercourse of life. The\r\npatience and industry of modern observers are often the theme of\r\nwell-merited praise, but we must look with a still higher degree of\r\nwonder on such men as Tycho Brahe and his contemporaries, who were\r\ndriven by the want of any timekeeper on which they could depend to the\r\nmost laborious expedients, and who nevertheless persevered to the best\r\nof their ability, undisgusted either by the tedium of such processes, or\r\nby the discouraging consciousness of the necessary imperfection of their\r\nmost approved methods and instruments.\r\n\r\nThe invariable regularity of the pendulum's motion was soon made\r\nsubservient to ulterior purposes beyond that of merely registering time.\r\nWe have seen the important assistance it afforded in establishing the\r\nlaws of motion; and when the theory founded on those laws was extended\r\nand improved, the pendulum was again instrumental, by a species of\r\napproximate reasoning familiar to all who are acquainted with physical\r\ninquiries, in pointing out by its minute irregularities in different\r\nparts of the earth, a corresponding change in the weight of all bodies\r\nin those different situations, supposed to be the consequence of a\r\ngreater distance from the axis of the earth's rotation; since that would\r\noccasion the force of attraction to be counterbalanced by an increased\r\ncentrifugal force. The theory which kept pace with the constantly\r\nincreasing accuracy of such observations, proving consistent in all\r\ntrials of it, has left little room for future doubts; and in this manner\r\nthe pendulum in intelligent hands became the simplest instrument for\r\nascertaining the form of the globe which we inhabit. An English\r\nastronomer, who corresponded with Kepler under the signature of Brutius\r\n(whose real name perhaps might be Bruce), had already declared his\r\nbelief in 1603, that \"the earth on which we tread is neither round nor\r\nglobular, but more nearly of an oval figure.\"[167] There is nothing to\r\nguide us to the grounds on which he formed this opinion, which was\r\nperhaps only a lucky guess. Kepler's note upon it is: \"This is not\r\naltogether to be contemned.\"\r\n\r\nA farther use of the pendulum is in furnishing a general and unperishing\r\nstandard of measure. This application is suggested in the third volume\r\nof the 'Reflections' of Mersenne, published in 1647, where he observes\r\nthat it may be best for the future not to divide time into hours,\r\nminutes, and seconds, but to express its parts by the number of\r\nvibrations of a pendulum of given length, swinging through a given arc.\r\nIt was soon seen that it would be more convenient to invert this\r\nprocess, and to choose as an unit of length the pendulum which should\r\nmake a certain number of vibrations in the unit of time, naturally\r\ndetermined by the revolution of the earth on its axis. Our Royal\r\nSociety took an active part in these experiments, which seem,\r\nnotwithstanding their utility, to have met from the first with much of\r\nthe same ridicule which was lavished upon them by the ignorant, when\r\nrecently repeated for the same purpose. \"I contend,\" says Graunt[168] in\r\na dedication to the Royal Society, dated 1662, \"against the envious\r\nschismatics of your society (who think you do nothing unless you\r\npresently transmute metals, make butter and cheese without milk, and, as\r\ntheir own ballad hath it, make leather without hides), by asserting the\r\nusefulness of even all your preparatory and luciferous experiments,\r\nbeing not the ceremonies, but the substance and principles of useful\r\narts. For I find in trade the want of an universal measure, and have\r\nheard musicians wrangle about the just and uniform keeping of time in\r\ntheir consorts, and therefore cannot with patience hear that your\r\nlabours about vibrations, eminently conducing to both, should be\r\nslighted, nor your pendula called swing-swangs with scorn.\"[169]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[153] One of the Commissioners was the father of Blaise Pascal.\r\n\r\n[154] These instruments were very inferior to those now in use under the\r\nsame name.

The rigid caution\r\nwith which he had been watched in Florence was in great measure relaxed,\r\nand he was permitted to see the friends who crowded round him to express\r\ntheir respect and sympathy. The Grand Duke visited him frequently, and\r\nmany distinguished strangers, such as Gassendi and Deodati, came into\r\nItaly solely for the purpose of testifying their admiration of his\r\ncharacter. Among other visitors the name of Milton will be read with\r\ninterest: we may probably refer to the effects of this interview the\r\nallusions to Galileo's discoveries, so frequently introduced into his\r\npoem. Milton mentions in his 'Areopagitica,' that he saw Galileo whilst\r\nin Italy, but enters into no details of his visit.\r\n\r\nGalileo was fond of society, and his cheerful and popular manners\r\nrendered him an universal favourite among those who were admitted to his\r\nintimacy. Among these, Viviani, who formed one of his family during the\r\nthree last years of his life, deserves particular notice, on account of\r\nthe strong attachment and almost filial veneration with which he ever\r\nregarded his master and benefactor. His long life, which was prolonged\r\nto the completion of his 81st year in 1703, enabled him to see the\r\ntriumphant establishment of the truths on account of which Galileo had\r\nendured so many insults; and even in his old age, when in his turn he\r\nhad acquired a claim to the reverence of a younger generation, our Royal\r\nSociety, who invited him among them in 1696, felt that the complimentary\r\nlanguage in which they addressed him as the first mathematician of the\r\nage would have been incomplete and unsatisfactory without an allusion to\r\nthe friendship that gained him the cherished title of \"The last pupil of\r\nGalileo.\"[170]\r\n\r\nTorricelli, another of Galileo's most celebrated followers, became a\r\nmember of his family in October, 1641: he first learned mathematics from\r\nCastelli, and occasionally lectured for him at Rome, in which manner he\r\nwas employed when Galileo, who had seen his book 'On Motion,' and\r\naugured the greatest success from such a beginning, invited him to his\r\nhouse—an offer which Torricelli eagerly embraced, although he enjoyed\r\nthe advantages of it but for a short time. He afterwards succeeded\r\nGalileo in his situation at the court of Florence,[171] but survived him\r\nonly a few years.\r\n\r\nIt is from the accounts of Viviani and Gherardini that we principally\r\ndraw the following particulars of Galileo's person and character:—Signor\r\nGalileo was of a cheerful and pleasant countenance, especially in his\r\nold age, square built, and well proportioned in stature, and rather\r\nabove the middle size. His complexion was fair and sanguine, his eyes\r\nbrilliant, and his hair of a reddish cast. His constitution was\r\nnaturally strong, but worn out by fatigue of mind and body, so as\r\nfrequently to be reduced to a state of the utmost weakness. He was\r\nsubject to attacks of hypochondria, and often molested by severe and\r\ndangerous illnesses, occasioned in great measure by his sleepless\r\nnights, the whole of which he frequently spent in astronomical\r\nobservations. During upwards of forty-eight years of his life, he was\r\ntormented with acute rheumatic pains, suffering particularly on any\r\nchange of weather. He found himself most free from these pains whilst\r\nresiding in the country, of which consequently he became very fond:\r\nbesides, he used to say that in the country he had greater freedom to\r\nread the book of Nature, which lay there open before him. His library\r\nwas very small, but well chosen, and open to the use of the friends whom\r\nhe loved to see assembled round him, and whom he was accustomed to\r\nreceive in the most hospitable manner. He ate sparingly himself; but was\r\nparticularly choice in the selection of his wines, which in the latter\r\npart of his life were regularly supplied out of the Grand Duke's\r\ncellars. This taste gave an additional stimulus to his agricultural\r\npursuits, and many of his leisure hours were spent in the cultivation\r\nand superintendence of his vineyards. It should seem that he was\r\nconsidered a good judge of wine; for Viviani has preserved one of his\r\nreceipts in a collection of miscellaneous experiments. In it he strongly\r\nrecommends that for wine of the first quality, that juice only should be\r\nemployed, which is pressed out by the mere weight of the heaped grapes,\r\nwhich would probably be that of the ripest fruit. The following letter,\r\nwritten in his 74th year, is dated, \"From my prison at Arcetri.—I am\r\nforced to avail myself of your assistance and favour, agreeably to your\r\nobliging offers, in consequence of the excessive chill of the weather,\r\nand of old age, and from having drained out my grand stock of a hundred\r\nbottles, which I laid in two years ago; not to mention some minor\r\nparticulars during the last two months, which I received from my Serene\r\nMaster, the Most Eminent Lord Cardinal, their Highnesses the Princes,\r\nand the Most Excellent Duke of Guise, besides cleaning out two barrels\r\nof the wine of this country. Now, I beg that with all due diligence and\r\nindustry, and with consideration, and taking counsel with the most\r\nrefined palates, you will provide me with two cases, that is to say,\r\nwith forty flasks of different wines, the most exquisite that you can\r\nfind: take no thought of the expense, because I stint myself so much in\r\nall other pleasures that I can afford to lay out something at the\r\nrequest of Bacchus, without giving offence to his two companions Ceres\r\nand Venus. You must be careful to leave out neither Scillo nor Carino (I\r\nbelieve they meant to call them Scylla and Charybdis), nor the country\r\nof my master, Archimedes of Syracuse, nor Greek wines, nor clarets, &c.\r\n&c. The expense I shall easily be able to satisfy, but not the infinite\r\nobligation.\"\r\n\r\nIn his expenditure Galileo observed a just mean between avarice and\r\nprofusion: he spared no cost necessary for the success of his many and\r\nvarious experiments, and spent large sums in charity and hospitality,\r\nand in assisting those in whom he discovered excellence in any art or\r\nprofession, many of whom he maintained in his own house. His temper was\r\neasily ruffled, but still more easily pacified. He seldom conversed on\r\nmathematical or philosophical topics except among his intimate friends;\r\nand when such subjects were abruptly brought before him, as was often\r\nthe case by the numberless visitors he was in the habit of receiving, he\r\nshowed great readiness in turning the conversation into more popular\r\nchannels, in such manner however that he often contrived to introduce\r\nsomething to satisfy the curiosity of the inquirers. His memory was\r\nuncommonly tenacious, and stored with a vast variety of old songs and\r\nstories, which he was in the constant habit of quoting and alluding to.\r\nHis favourite Italian authors were Ariosto, Petrarca, and Berni, great\r\npart of whose poems he was able to repeat. His excessive admiration of\r\nAriosto determined the side which he took against Tasso in the virulent\r\nand unnecessary controversy which has divided Italy so long on the\r\nrespective merits of these two great poets; and he was accustomed to say\r\nthat reading Tasso after Ariosto was like tasting cucumbers after\r\nmelons. When quite a youth, he wrote a great number of critical remarks\r\non Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata, which one of his friends borrowed, and\r\nforgot to return. For a long time it was thought that the manuscript had\r\nperished, till the Abbé Serassi discovered it, whilst collecting\r\nmaterials for his Life of Tasso, published at Rome in 1785. Serassi\r\nbeing a violent partizan of Tasso, but also unwilling to lose the credit\r\nof the discovery, copied the manuscript, but without any intention of\r\npublishing it, \"till he could find leisure for replying properly to the\r\nsophistical and unfounded attacks of a critic so celebrated on other\r\naccounts.\" He announced his discovery as having been made \"in one of the\r\nfamous libraries at Rome,\" which vague indication he with some reason\r\nconsidered insufficient to lead to a second discovery. On Serassi's\r\ndeath his copy was found, containing a reference to the situation of the\r\noriginal; the criticisms were published, and form the greatest part of\r\nthe last volume of the Milan edition of Galileo's works. The manuscript\r\nwas imperfect at the time of this second discovery, several leaves\r\nhaving been torn out, it is not known by whom.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the most judicious Italian critics appears to be, that it\r\nwould have been more for Galileo's credit if these remarks had never\r\nbeen made public: they are written in a spirit of flippant violence,\r\nsuch as might not be extraordinary in a common juvenile critic, but\r\nwhich it is painful to notice from the pen of Galileo. Two or three\r\nsonnets are extant written by Galileo himself, and in two instances he\r\nhas not scrupled to appropriate the conceits of the poet he affected to\r\nundervalue.[172] It should be mentioned that Galileo's matured taste\r\nrather receded from the violence of his early prejudices, for at a later\r\nperiod of his life he used to shun comparing the two; and when forced to\r\ngive an opinion he said, \"that Tasso's appeared the finer poem, but that\r\nAriosto gave him the greater pleasure.\" Besides these sonnets, there is\r\nextant a short burlesque poem written by him, \"In abuse of Gowns,\" when,\r\non his first becoming Professor at Pisa, he found himself obliged by\r\ncustom to wear his professional habit in every company. It is written\r\nnot without humour, but does not bear comparison with Berni, whom he\r\nimitated.\r\n\r\nThere are several detached subjects treated of by Galileo, which may be\r\nnoticed in this place. A letter by him containing the solution of a\r\nproblem in Chances is probably the earliest notice extant of the\r\napplication of mathematics to that interesting subject: the\r\ncorrespondence between Pascal and Fermat, with which its history is\r\ngenerally made to begin, not having taken place till at least twelve\r\nyears later. There can be little doubt after the clear account of Carlo\r\nDati, that Galileo was the first to examine the curve called the\r\nCycloid, described by a point in the rim of a wheel rolling on a\r\nstraight line, which he recommended as a graceful form for the arch of a\r\nbridge at Pisa. He even divined that the area contained between it and\r\nits base is exactly three times that of the generating circle. He seems\r\nto have been unable to verify this guess by strict geometrical\r\nreasoning, for Viviani tells an odd story, that in order to satisfy his\r\ndoubts he cut out several large cycloids of pasteboard, but finding the\r\nweight in every trial to be rather less than three times that of the\r\ncircle, he suspected the proportion to be irrational, and that there was\r\nsome error in his estimation; the inquiry he abandoned was afterwards\r\nresumed with success by his pupil Torricelli.[173]\r\n\r\nThe account which Lagalla gives of an experiment shown in his presence\r\nby Galileo, carries the observation of the phosphorescence of the\r\nBologna stone at least as far back as 1612.[174] Other writers mention\r\nthe name of an alchymist, who according to them discovered it\r\naccidentally in 1603. Cesi, Lagalla, and one or two others, had passed\r\nthe night at Galileo's house, with the intention of observing Venus and\r\nSaturn; but, the night being cloudy, the conversation turned on other\r\nmatters, and especially on the nature of light, \"on which Galileo took a\r\nsmall wooden box at daybreak before sunrise, and showed us some small\r\nstones in it, desiring us to observe that they were not in the least\r\ndegree luminous. Having then exposed them for some time to the twilight,\r\nhe shut the window again; and in the midst of the dark room showed us\r\nthe stones, shining and glistening with a faint light, which we saw\r\npresently decay and become extinguished.\" In 1640, Liceti attempted to\r\nrefer the effect of the earthshine upon the moon to a similar\r\nphosphorescent quality of that luminary, to which Galileo, then aged 76,\r\nreplied by a long and able letter, enforcing the true explanation he had\r\nformerly given.\r\n\r\nAlthough quite blind, and nearly deaf, the intellectual powers of\r\nGalileo remained to the end of his life; but he occasionally felt that\r\nhe was overworking himself, and used to complain to his friend Micanzio\r\nthat he found his head too busy for his body. \"I cannot keep my restless\r\nbrain from grinding on, although with great loss of time; for whatever\r\nidea comes into my head with respect to any novelty, drives out of it\r\nwhatever I had been thinking of just before.\" He was busily engaged in\r\nconsidering the nature of the force of percussion, and Torricelli was\r\nemployed in arranging his investigations for a continuation of the\r\n'Dialogues on Motion,' when he was seized with an attack of fever and\r\npalpitation of the heart, which, after an illness of two months, put an\r\nend to his long, laborious, and useful life, on the 8th of January,\r\n1642, just one year before his great successor Newton was born.\r\n\r\nThe malice of his enemies was scarcely allayed by his death. His right\r\nof making a will was disputed, as having died a prisoner to the\r\nInquisition, as well as his right to burial in consecrated ground. These\r\nwere at last conceded, but Urban anxiously interfered to prevent the\r\ndesign of erecting a monument to him in the church of Santa Croce, in\r\nFlorence, for which a large sum had been subscribed. His body was\r\naccordingly buried in an obscure corner of the church, which for upwards\r\nof thirty years after his death was unmarked even by an inscription to\r\nhis memory. It was not till a century later that the splendid monument\r\nwas erected which now covers his and Viviani's remains. When their\r\nbodies were disinterred in 1737 for the purpose of being removed to\r\ntheir new resting-place, Capponi, the president of the Florentine\r\nAcademy, in a spirit of spurious admiration, mutilated Galileo's body,\r\nby removing the thumb and forefinger of the right-hand, and one of the\r\nvertebræ of the back, which are still preserved in some of the Italian\r\nmuseums. The monument was put up at the expense of his biographer,\r\nNelli, to whom Viviani's property descended, charged with the condition\r\nof erecting it. Nor was this the only public testimony which Viviani\r\ngave of his attachment. The medal which he struck in honour of Galileo\r\nhas already been mentioned; he also, as soon as it was safe to do so,\r\ncovered every side of the house in which he lived with laudatory\r\ninscriptions to the same effect. A bust of Galileo was placed over the\r\ndoor, and two bas-reliefs on each side representing some of his\r\nprincipal discoveries. Not less than five other medals were struck in\r\nhonour of him during his residence at Padua and Florence, which are all\r\nengraved in Venturi's Memoirs.\r\n\r\nThere are several good portraits of Galileo extant, two of which, by\r\nTiti and Subtermanns, are engraved in Nelli's Life of Galileo. Another\r\nby Subtermanns is in the Florentine Gallery, and an engraving from a\r\ncopy of this is given by Venturi. There is also a very fine engraving\r\nfrom the original picture. An engraving from another original picture is\r\nin the frontispiece of the Padua edition of his works. Salusbury seems\r\nin the following passage to describe a portrait of Galileo painted by\r\nhimself: \"He did not contemn the other inferior arts, for he had a good\r\nhand in sculpture and carving; but his particular care was to paint\r\nwell. By the pencil he described what his telescope discovered; in one\r\nhe exceeded art, in the other, nature. Osorius, the eloquent bishop of\r\nSylva, esteems one piece of Mendoza the wise Spanish minister's\r\nfelicity, to have been this, that he was contemporary to Titian, and\r\nthat by his hand he was drawn in a fair tablet. And Galilæus, lest he\r\nshould want the same good fortune, made so great a progress in this\r\ncurious art, that he became his own _Buonarota_; and because there was\r\nno other copy worthy of his pencil, drew himself.\" No other author makes\r\nthe slightest allusion to such a painting; and it appears more likely\r\nthat Salusbury should be mistaken than that so interesting a portrait\r\nshould have been entirely lost sight of.\r\n\r\nGalileo's house at Arcetri was standing in 1821, when Venturi visited\r\nit, and found it in the same state in which Galileo might be supposed to\r\nhave left it. It is situated nearly a mile from Florence, on the\r\nsouth-eastern side, and about a gun-shot to the north-west of the\r\nconvent of St. Matthew. Nelli placed a suitable inscription over the\r\ndoor of the house, which belonged in 1821 to a Signor Alimari.[175]\r\n\r\nAlthough Nelli's Life of Galileo disappointed the expectations that had\r\nbeen formed of it, it is impossible for any admirer of Galileo not to\r\nfeel the greatest degree of gratitude towards him, for the successful\r\nactivity with which he rescued so many records of the illustrious\r\nphilosopher from destruction. After Galileo's death, the principal part\r\nof his books, manuscripts, and instruments, were put into the charge of\r\nViviani, who was himself at that time an object of great suspicion; most\r\nof them he thought it prudent to conceal, till the superstitious\r\noutcries against Galileo should be silenced. At Viviani's death, he left\r\nhis library, containing a very complete collection of the works of all\r\nthe mathematicians who had preceded him (and amongst them those of\r\nGalileo, Torricelli, and Castelli, all which were enriched with notes\r\nand additions by himself), to the hospital of St. Mary at Florence,\r\nwhere an extensive library already existed. The directors of the\r\nhospital sold this unique collection in 1781, when it became entirely\r\ndispersed. The manuscripts in Viviani's possession passed to his nephew,\r\nthe Abbé Panzanini, together with the portraits of the chief personages\r\nof the Galilean school, Galileo's instruments, and, among other\r\ncuriosities, the emerald ring which he wore as a member of the Lyncean\r\nAcademy. A great number of these books and manuscripts were purchased at\r\ndifferent times by Nelli, after the death of Panzanini, from his\r\nrelations, who were ignorant or regardless of their value. One of his\r\nchief acquisitions was made by an extraordinary accident, related by\r\nTozzetti with the following details, which we repeat, as they seem to\r\nauthenticate the story:—\"In the spring of 1739, the famous Doctor Lami\r\nwent out according to his custom to breakfast with some of his friends\r\nat the inn of the Bridge, by the starting-place; and as he and Sig.\r\nNelli were passing through the market, it occurred to them to buy some\r\nBologna sausages from the pork-butcher, Cioci, who was supposed to excel\r\nin making them. They went into the shop, had their sausages cut off and\r\nrolled in paper, which Nelli put into his hat. On reaching the inn, and\r\ncalling for a plate to put them in, Nelli observed that the paper in\r\nwhich they had been rolled was one of Galileo's letters. He cleaned it\r\nas well as he could with his napkin, and put it into his pocket without\r\nsaying a word to Lami; and as soon as he returned into the city, and\r\ncould get clear of him, he flew to the shop of Cioci, who told him that\r\na servant whom he did not know brought him from time to time similar\r\nletters, which he bought by weight as waste paper. Nelli bought all that\r\nremained, and on the servant's next reappearance in a few days, he\r\nlearned the quarter whence they came, and after some time succeeded at a\r\nsmall expense in getting into his own possession an old corn-chest,\r\ncontaining all that still remained of the precious treasures which\r\nViviani had concealed in it ninety years before.\"[176]\r\n\r\nThe earliest biographical notice of Galileo is that in the Obituary of\r\nthe Mercurio Italico, published at Venice in 1647, by Vittorio Siri. It\r\nis very short, but contains an exact enumeration of his principal works\r\nand discoveries. Rossi, who wrote under the name of Janus Nicius\r\nErythræus, introduced an account of Galileo in his Pinacotheca Imaginum\r\nIllustrium, in which the story of his illegitimacy first made its\r\nappearance. In 1664, Salusbury published a life of Galileo in the second\r\nvolume of his Mathematical Collections, the greater part of which is a\r\ntranslation of Galileo's principal works. Almost the whole edition of\r\nthe second volume of Salusbury's book was burnt in the great fire of\r\nLondon. Chauffepié says that only one copy is known to be extant in\r\nEngland: this is now in the well-known library of the Earl of\r\nMacclesfield, to whose kindness the author is much indebted for the use\r\nhe has been allowed to make of this unique volume. A fragment of this\r\nsecond volume is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The translations in\r\nthe preceding pages are mostly founded upon Salusbury's version.\r\nSalusbury's account, although that of an enthusiastic admirer of\r\nGalileo, is too prolix to be interesting: the general style of the\r\nperformance may be guessed from the title of the first chapter—'Of Man\r\nin general, and how he excelleth all the other Animals.' After informing\r\nhis readers that Galileo was born at Pisa, he proceeds:—\"Italy is\r\naffirmed to have been the first that peopled the world after the\r\nuniversal deluge, being governed by Janus, Cameses, and Saturn, &c.\" His\r\ndescription of Galileo's childhood is somewhat quaint. \"Before others\r\nhad left making of dirt pyes, he was framing of diagrams; and whilst\r\nothers were whipping of toppes, he was considering the cause of their\r\nmotion.\" It is on the whole tolerably correct, especially if we take\r\ninto account that Salusbury had not yet seen Viviani's Life, though\r\ncomposed some years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Galileo by Viviani was first written as an outline of an\r\nintended larger work, but this latter was never completed. This sketch\r\nwas published in the Memoirs of the Florentine Academy, of which Galileo\r\nhad been one of the annual presidents, and afterwards prefixed to the\r\ncomplete editions of Galileo's works; it is written in a very agreeable\r\nand flowing style, and has been the groundwork of most subsequent\r\naccounts. Another original memoir by Niccolò Gherardini, was published\r\nby Tozzetti. A great number of references to authors who have treated of\r\nGalileo is given by Sach in his Onomasticon. An approved Latin memoir by\r\nBrenna is in the first volume of Fabroni's Vitæ Italorum Illustrium; he\r\nhas however fallen into several errors: this same work contains the\r\nlives of several of his principal followers.\r\n\r\nThe article in Chauffepié's Continuation of Bayle's Dictionary does not\r\ncontain anything which is not in the earlier accounts.\r\n\r\nAndrès wrote an essay entitled 'Saggio sulla Filosofia del Galileo,'\r\npublished at Mantua 1776; and Jagemann published his 'Geschichte des\r\nLeben des Galileo' at Leipzig, in 1787;[177] neither of these the author\r\nhas been able to meet with. An analysis of the latter may be seen in\r\nKästner's 'Geschichte der Mathematik, Göttingen, 1800,' from which it\r\ndoes not appear to contain any additional details. The 'Elogio del\r\nGalileo' by Paolo Frisi, first published at Leghorn in 1775, is, as its\r\ntitle expresses, rather in the nature of a panegyric than of a\r\ncontinuous biographical account. It is written with very great elegance\r\nand intimate knowledge of the subjects of which it treats. Nelli gave\r\nseveral curious particulars with respect to Galileo in his 'Saggio di\r\nStoria Letteraria Fiorentina, Lucca, 1759;' and in 1793 published his\r\nlarge work entitled 'Vita e Commercio Letterario di Galileo Galilei.' So\r\nuninteresting a book was probably never written from such excellent\r\nmaterials. Two thick quarto volumes are filled with repetitions of the\r\naccounts that were already in print, the bulky preparation of which\r\ncompelled the author to forego the publication of the vast collection of\r\noriginal documents which his unwearied zeal and industry had collected.\r\nThis defect has been in great measure supplied by Venturi in 1818 and\r\n1821, who has not only incorporated in his work many of Nelli's\r\nmanuscripts, but has brought together a number of scattered notices of\r\nGalileo and his writings from a variety of outlying sources—a service\r\nwhich the writer is able to appreciate from having gone through the\r\ngreatest part of the same labour before he was fortunate enough to meet\r\nwith Venturi's book. Still there are many letters cited by Nelli, which\r\ndo not appear either in his book or Venturi's. Carlo Dati, in 1663,\r\nquotes \"the registers of Galileo's correspondence arranged in\r\nalphabetical order, in ten large volumes.\"[178] The writer has no means\r\nof ascertaining what collection this may have been; it is difficult to\r\nsuppose that one so arranged should have been lost sight of. It is\r\nunderstood that a life of Galileo is preparing at this moment in\r\nFlorence, by desire of the present Grand Duke, which will probably throw\r\nmuch additional light on the character and merits of this great and\r\nuseful philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe first editions of his various treatises, as mentioned by Nelli, are\r\ngiven below. Clement, in his 'Bibliothèque Curieuse,' has pointed out\r\nsuch among them, and the many others which have been printed, as have\r\nbecome rare.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine edition is the one used by the Academia della Crusca for\r\ntheir references; for which reason its paging is marked in the margin of\r\nthe edition of Padua, which is much more complete, and is the one which\r\nhas been on the present occasion principally consulted.\r\n\r\nThe latter contains the Dialogue on the System, which was not suffered\r\nto be printed in the former editions. The twelve first volumes of the\r\nlast edition of Milan are a mere transcript of that of Padua: the\r\nthirteenth contains in addition the Letter to the Grand Duchess, the\r\nCommentary on Tasso, with some minor pieces. A complete edition is still\r\nwanted, embodying all the recently discovered documents, and omitting\r\nthe verbose commentaries, which, however useful when they were written,\r\nnow convey little information that cannot be more agreeably and more\r\nprofitably learned in treatises of a later date.\r\n\r\nSuch was the life, and such were the pursuits, of this extraordinary\r\nman. The numberless inventions of his acute industry; the use of the\r\ntelescope, and the brilliant discoveries to which it led; the patient\r\ninvestigation of the laws of weight and motion; must all be looked upon\r\nas forming but a part of his real merits, as merely particular\r\ndemonstrations of the spirit in which he everywhere withstood the\r\ndespotism of ignorance, and appealed boldly from traditional opinions to\r\nthe judgments of reason and common sense. He claimed and bequeathed to\r\nus the right of exercising our faculties in examining the beautiful\r\ncreation which surrounds us. Idolized by his friends, he deserved their\r\naffection by numberless acts of kindness; by his good humour, his\r\naffability, and by the benevolent generosity with which he devoted\r\nhimself and a great part of his limited income to advance their talents\r\nand fortunes. If an intense desire of being useful is everywhere worthy\r\nof honour; if its value is immeasurably increased, when united to genius\r\nof the highest order; if we feel for one who, notwithstanding such\r\ntitles to regard, is harassed by cruel persecution,—then none deserve\r\nour sympathy, our admiration, and our gratitude, more than Galileo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Galileo's Works._\r\n\r\n  Le Operazioni del Compasso Geom. e Milit.\r\n                                            Padova, 1606.\r\n  Fol.

As\r\nhis success furnishes the best instance of the value of the inductive\r\nprocess, so the failures and blunders of his adversaries supply equally\r\ngood examples of the dangers and the barrenness of the opposite course.\r\nThe history of JOHN KEPLER might, at the first view, suggest conclusions\r\nsomewhat inconsistent with this remark. Every one who is but moderately\r\nacquainted with astronomy is familiar with the discoveries which that\r\nscience owes to him; the manner in which he made them is, perhaps, not\r\nso generally known. This extraordinary man pursued, almost invariably,\r\nthe hypothetical method. His life was passed in speculating on the\r\nresults of a few principles assumed by him, from very precarious\r\nanalogies, as the causes of the phenomena actually observed in Nature.\r\nWe nevertheless find that he did, in spite of this unphilosophical\r\nmethod, arrive at discoveries which have served as guides to some of the\r\nmost valuable truths of modern science.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty will disappear if we attend more closely to the details\r\nof Kepler's investigations. We shall perceive that to an unusual degree\r\nof rashness in the formation of his systems, he added a quality very\r\nrarely possessed by philosophers of the hypothetical school. One of the\r\ngreatest intellectual vices of the latter was a wilful blindness to the\r\ndiscrepancy of facts from their creed, a perverse and obstinate\r\nresistance to physical evidence, leading not unfrequently to an attempt\r\nat disguising the truth. From this besetting sin of the school, which\r\nfrom an intellectual fault often degenerated into a moral one, Kepler\r\nwas absolutely free. Scheme after scheme, resting originally upon little\r\nbeyond his own glowing imagination, but examined and endeared by the\r\nceaseless labour of years, was unhesitatingly sacrificed, as soon as its\r\ninsufficiency became indisputable, to make room for others as little\r\ndeserving support. The history of philosophy affords no more remarkable\r\ninstance of sincere uncompromising love of truth. To this virtue he owed\r\nhis great discoveries: it must be attributed to his unhappy method that\r\nhe made no more.\r\n\r\nIn considering this opinion upon the real nature of Kepler's title to\r\nfame, it ought not to be forgotten that he has exposed himself at a\r\ndisadvantage on which certainly very few philosophers would venture. His\r\nsingular candour allowed him to comment upon his own errors with the\r\nsame freedom as if scrutinizing the work of a stranger; careless whether\r\nthe impression on his readers were favourable or otherwise to himself,\r\nprovided it was instructive. Few writers have spoken so much, and so\r\nfreely of themselves, as Kepler. He records, on almost every occasion,\r\nthe train of thought by which he was led to each of the discoveries that\r\neventually repaid his perseverance; and he has thus given us a most\r\ncurious and interesting view of the workings of a mind of great, though\r\neccentric power. \"In what follows,\" says he (when introducing a long\r\nstring of suppositions, of which he had already discovered the fallacy),\r\n\"let the reader pardon my credulity, whilst working out all these\r\nmatters by my own ingenuity. For it is my opinion that the occasions by\r\nwhich men have acquired a knowledge of celestial phenomena are not less\r\nadmirable than the discoveries themselves.\" Agreeing altogether with\r\nthis opinion in its widest application, we have not scrupled, in the\r\nfollowing sketch, to introduce at some length an account even of\r\nKepler's erroneous speculations; they are in themselves very amusing,\r\nand will have the additional utility of proving the dangerous tendency\r\nof his method; they will show by how many absurd theories, and how many\r\nyears of wasted labour, his real discoveries and services to science lie\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nJOHN KEPLER was born (as we are assured by his earliest biographer\r\nHantsch) in long. 29° 7´, lat. 48° 54´, on the 21st day of December,\r\n1571. On this spot stands the imperial city of Weil, in the duchy of\r\nWirtemberg. His parents were Henry Kepler and Catherine Guldenmann, both\r\nof noble, though decayed families. Henry Kepler, at the time of his\r\nmarriage, was a petty officer in the Duke of Wirtemberg's service; and a\r\nfew years after the birth of his eldest son John, he joined the army\r\nthen serving in the Netherlands. His wife followed him, leaving their\r\nson, then in his fifth year, at Leonberg, under the care of his\r\ngrandfather. He was a seven months child, very weak and sickly; and\r\nafter recovering with difficulty from a severe attack of small-pox, he\r\nwas sent to school in 1577. Henry Kepler's limited income was still\r\nfarther reduced on his return into Germany, the following year, in\r\nconsequence of the absconding of one of his acquaintance, for whom he\r\nhad incautiously become surety. His circumstances were so much narrowed\r\nby this misfortune, that he was obliged to sell his house, and nearly\r\nall that he possessed, and for several years he supported his family by\r\nkeeping a tavern at Elmendingen. This occasioned great interruption to\r\nyoung Kepler's education; he was taken from school, and employed in\r\nmenial services till his twelfth year, when he was again placed in the\r\nschool at Elmendingen. In the following year he was again seized with a\r\nviolent illness, so that his life was almost despaired of. In 1586, he\r\nwas admitted into the monastic school of Maulbronn, where the cost of\r\nhis education was defrayed by the Duke of Wirtemberg. This school was\r\none of those established on the suppression of the monasteries at the\r\nReformation, and the usual course of education followed there required\r\nthat the students, after remaining a year in the superior classes,\r\nshould offer themselves for examination at the college of Tubingen for\r\nthe degree of bachelor: they then returned to their school with the\r\ntitle of veterans; and after completing the studies taught there, they\r\nwere admitted as resident students at Tubingen, proceeded in about a\r\nyear to the degree of master, and were then allowed to commence their\r\ncourse of theology. The three years of Kepler's life following his\r\nadmission to Maulbronn, were marked by periodical returns of several of\r\nthe disorders which had well nigh proved fatal to him in his childhood.\r\nDuring the same time disagreements arose between his parents, in\r\nconsequence of which his father quitted his home, and soon after died\r\nabroad. After his father's departure, his mother also quarrelled with\r\nher relations, having been treated, says Hantsch, \"with a degree of\r\nbarbarity by her husband and brother-in-law that was hardly exceeded\r\neven by her own perverseness:\" one of his brothers died, and the\r\nfamily-affairs were in the greatest confusion. Notwithstanding these\r\ndisadvantages, Kepler took his degree of master in August 1591,\r\nattaining the second place in the annual examination. The first name on\r\nthe list was John Hippolytus Brentius.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was thus engaged at Tubingen, the astronomical lectureship at\r\nGratz, the chief town of Styria, became vacant by the death of George\r\nStadt, and the situation was offered to Kepler. Of this first occasion\r\nof turning his thoughts towards astronomy, he has himself given the\r\nfollowing account: \"As soon as I was of an age to feel the charms of\r\nphilosophy, I embraced every part of it with intense desire, but paid no\r\nespecial regard to astronomy. I had indeed capacity enough for it, and\r\nlearned without difficulty the geometrical and astronomical theorems\r\noccurring in the usual course of the school, being well grounded in\r\nfigures, numbers, and proportions. But those were compulsory\r\nstudies—there was nothing to show a particular turn for astronomy. I\r\nwas educated at the expense of the Duke of Wirtemberg, and when I saw\r\nsuch of my companions as the duke selected to send abroad shrink in\r\nvarious ways from their employments, out of fondness for home, I, who\r\nwas more callous, had early made up my mind to go with the utmost\r\nreadiness whithersoever I might be sent. The first offering itself was\r\nan astronomical post, which I was in fact forced to accept by the\r\nauthority of my tutors; not that I was alarmed, in the manner I had\r\ncondemned in others, by the remoteness of the situation, but by the\r\nunexpected and contemptible nature of the office, and by the slightness\r\nof my information in this branch of philosophy. I entered on it,\r\ntherefore, better furnished with talent than knowledge: with many\r\nprotestations that I was not abandoning my claim to be provided for in\r\nsome other more brilliant profession. What progress I made in the first\r\ntwo years of my studies, may be seen in my 'Mysterium Cosmographicum;'\r\nand the encouragement given me by my tutor, Mästlin, to take up the\r\nscience of astronomy, may be read in the same book, and in his letter\r\nwhich is prefixed to the 'Narrative of Rheticus.' I looked on that\r\ndiscovery as of the highest importance, and still more so, because I saw\r\nhow greatly it was approved by Mästlin.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of the singular work to which Kepler thus refers with so much\r\ncomplacency, will be best shown by quoting some of the most remarkable\r\nparts of it, and especially the preface, in which he briefly details\r\nsome of the theories he successively examined and rejected, before\r\ndetecting (as he imagined he had here done) the true cause of the number\r\nand order of the heavenly bodies. The other branches of philosophy with\r\nwhich he occupied himself in his younger years, were those treated by\r\nScaliger in his 'Exoteric Exercises,' to the study of which book Kepler\r\nattributed the formation of many of his opinions; and he tells us that\r\nhe devoted much time \"to the examination of the nature of heaven, of\r\nsouls, of genii, of the elements, of the essence of fire, of the cause\r\nof fountains, the ebb and flow of the tide, the shape of the continents,\r\nand inland seas, and things of this sort.\" He also says, that by his\r\nfirst success with the heavens, his hopes were greatly inflamed of\r\ndiscovering similar analogies in the rest of the visible world, and for\r\nthis reason, named his book merely a Prodromus, or Forerunner, meaning,\r\nat some future period, to subjoin the Aftercomer, or Sequel. But this\r\nintention was never fulfilled; either his imagination failed him, or,\r\nwhat is more likely, the laborious calculations in which his\r\nastronomical theories engaged him, left him little time for turning his\r\nattention to objects unconnected with his first pursuit.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that we are admitted to trace the progress of thought in\r\nthose who have distinguished themselves by talent and originality; and\r\nalthough the whole of the following speculations begin and end in error,\r\nyet they are so characteristic, and exhibit such an extraordinary\r\npicture of the extravagances into which Kepler's lively imagination was\r\ncontinually hurrying him, that we cannot refrain from citing nearly the\r\nwhole preface. From it, better than from any enumeration of\r\npeculiarities, the reader will at once apprehend the nature of his\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\n\"When I was attending the celebrated Mästlin, six years ago, at\r\nTubingen, I was disturbed by the manifold inconveniences of the common\r\ntheory of the universe, and so delighted with Copernicus, whom Mästlin\r\nwas frequently in the habit of quoting with great respect, that I not\r\nonly often defended his propositions in the physical disputations of the\r\ncandidates, but also wrote a correct essay on the primary motion,\r\nmaintaining, that it is caused by the rotation of the earth. And I was\r\nthen at that point that I attributed to the earth the motion of the sun\r\non physical (or, if you will, on metaphysical) grounds, as Copernicus\r\nhad done for mathematical reasons. And, by this practice, I came by\r\ndegrees, partly from Mästlin's instructions, and partly from my own\r\nefforts, to understand the superior mathematical convenience of the\r\nsystem of Copernicus beyond Ptolemy's. This labour might have been\r\nspared me, by Joachim Rheticus, who has shortly and clearly explained\r\neverything in his first Narrative. While incidentally engaged in these\r\nlabours, in the intermission of my theology, it happened conveniently\r\nthat I succeeded George Stadt in his situation at Gratz, where the\r\nnature of my office connected me more closely with these studies.\r\nEverything I had learned from Mästlin, or had acquired of myself, was\r\nthere of great service to me in explaining the first elements of\r\nastronomy. And, as in Virgil, '_Fama mobilitate viget, viresque acquirit\r\neundo_,' so it was with me, that the diligent thought on these things\r\nwas the occasion of still further thinking: until, at last, in the year\r\n1595, when I had some intermission of my lectures allowed me, I brooded\r\nwith the whole energy of my mind on this subject. There were three\r\nthings in particular, of which I pertinaciously sought the causes why\r\nthey are not other than they are: the number, the size, and the motion\r\nof the orbits. I attempted the thing at first with numbers, and\r\nconsidered whether one of the orbits might be double, triple, quadruple,\r\nor any other multiple of the others, and how much, according to\r\nCopernicus, each differed from the rest. I spent a great deal of time in\r\nthat labour, as if it were mere sport, but could find no equality either\r\nin the proportions or the differences, and I gained nothing from this\r\nbeyond imprinting deeply in my memory the distances as assigned by\r\nCopernicus; unless, perhaps, reader, this record of my various attempts\r\nmay force your assent, backwards and forwards, as the waves of the sea;\r\nuntil tired at length, you will willingly repose yourself, as in a safe\r\nhaven, on the reasons explained in this book. However, I was comforted\r\nin some degree, and my hopes of success were supported as well by other\r\nreasons which will follow presently, as by observing that the motions in\r\nevery case seemed to be connected with the distances, and that where\r\nthere was a great gap between the orbits, there was the same between the\r\nmotions. And I reasoned, that if God had adapted motions to the orbits\r\nin some relation to the distances, it was probable that he had also\r\narrayed the distances themselves in relation to something else.\r\n\r\n\"Finding no success by this method, I tried another, of singular\r\naudacity. I inserted a new planet between Mars and Jupiter, and another\r\nbetween Venus and Mercury, both of which I supposed invisible, perhaps\r\non account of their smallness, and I attributed to each a certain period\r\nof revolution.[179] I thought that I could thus contrive some equality\r\nof proportions, increasing between every two, from the sun to the fixed\r\nstars. For instance, the Earth is nearer Venus in parts of the\r\nterrestrial orbit, than Mars is to the Earth in parts of the orbit of\r\nMars. But not even the interposition of a new planet sufficed for the\r\nenormous gap between Mars and Jupiter; for the proportion of Jupiter to\r\nthe new planet was still greater than that of Saturn to Jupiter. And\r\nalthough, by this supposition, I got some sort of a proportion, yet\r\nthere was no reasonable conclusion, no certain determination of the\r\nnumber of the planets either towards the fixed stars, till we should get\r\nas far as them, nor ever towards the Sun, because the division in this\r\nproportion of the residuary space within Mercury might be continued\r\nwithout end. Nor could I form any conjecture, from the mobility of\r\nparticular numbers, why, among an infinite number, so few should be\r\nmoveable. The opinion advanced by Rheticus in his Narrative is\r\nimprobable, where he reasons from the sanctity of the number six to the\r\nnumber of the six moveable heavens; for he who is inquiring of the frame\r\nof the world itself, must not derive reasons from these numbers, which\r\nhave gained importance from things of later date.\r\n\r\n\"I sought again, in another way, whether the distance of every planet is\r\nnot as the residuum of a sine; and its motion as the residuum of the\r\nsine of the complement in the same quadrant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Conceive the square AB to be constructed, whose side AC is equal to the\r\nsemidiameter of the universe. From the angle B opposite to A the place\r\nof the sun, or centre of the world, describe the quadrant DC with the\r\nradius BC. Then in AC, the true radius of the world, let the sun, fixed\r\nstars, and planets be marked at their respective distances, and from\r\nthese points draw lines parallel to BC, meeting the quadrant. I imagined\r\nthe moving force acting on each of the planets to be in the proportion\r\nof these parallels. In the line of the sun is infinity, because AD is\r\ntouched, and not cut, by the quadrant: therefore the moving force is\r\ninfinite in the sun, as deriving no motion except from its own act. In\r\nMercury the infinite line is cut off at K, and therefore at this point\r\nthe motion is comparable with the others. In the fixed stars the line is\r\naltogether lost, and compressed into a mere point C; therefore at that\r\npoint there is no moving force. This was the theorem, which was to be\r\ntried by calculation; but if any one will reflect that two things were\r\nwanting to me, first, that I did not know the size of the _Sinus Totus_,\r\nthat is, the radius of the proposed quadrant; secondly, that the\r\nenergies of the motions were not thus expressed otherwise than in\r\nrelation one to another; whoever, I say, well considers this, will\r\ndoubt, not without reason, as to the progress I was likely to make in\r\nthis difficult course. And yet, with unremitting labour, and an infinite\r\nreciprocation of sines and arcs, I did get so far as to be convinced\r\nthat this theory could not hold.\r\n\r\n\"Almost the whole summer was lost in these annoying labours; at last, by\r\na trifling accident, I lighted more nearly on the truth. I looked on it\r\nas an interposition of Providence, that I should obtain by chance, what\r\nI had failed to discover with my utmost exertions; and I believed this\r\nthe more, because I prayed constantly that I might succeed, if\r\nCopernicus had really spoken the truth. It happened on the 9th or\r\n19th[180] day of July, in the year 1595, that, having occasion to show,\r\nin my lecture-room, the passages of the great conjunctions through eight\r\nsigns, and how they pass gradually from one trine aspect to another, I\r\ninscribed in a circle a great number of triangles, or quasi-triangles,\r\nso that the end of one was made the beginning of another. In this manner\r\na smaller circle was shadowed out by the points in which the lines\r\ncrossed each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Scheme of the great Conjunctions of SATURN & JUPITER,\r\ntheir leaps through eight Signs, and their passages through all the four\r\nTriplicities of the Zodiac.]\r\n\r\n\"The radius of a circle inscribed in a triangle is half the radius of\r\nthat described about it; therefore the proportion between these two\r\ncircles struck the eye as almost identical with that between Saturn and\r\nJupiter, and the triangle is the first figure, just as Saturn and\r\nJupiter are the first planets. On the spot I tried the second distance\r\nbetween Jupiter and Mars with a square, the third with a pentagon, the\r\nfourth with a hexagon. And as the eye again cried out against the second\r\ndistance between Jupiter and Mars, I combined the square with a triangle\r\nand a pentagon. There would be no end of mentioning every trial. The\r\nfailure of this fruitless attempt was the beginning of the last\r\nfortunate one; for I reflected, that in this way I should never reach\r\nthe sun, if I wished to observe the same rule throughout; nor should I\r\nhave any reason why there were six, rather than twenty or a hundred\r\nmoveable orbits. And yet figures pleased me, as being quantities, and as\r\nhaving existed before the heavens; for quantity was created with matter,\r\nand the heavens afterwards. But if (this was the current of my\r\nthoughts), in relation to the quantity and proportion of the six orbits,\r\nas Copernicus has determined them among the infinite other figures, five\r\nonly could be found having peculiar properties above the rest, my\r\nbusiness would be done. And then again it struck me, what have plane\r\nfigures to do among solid orbits? Solid bodies ought rather to be\r\nintroduced. This, reader, is the invention and the whole substance of\r\nthis little work; for if any one, though but moderately skilled in\r\ngeometry, should hear these words hinted, the five regular solids will\r\ndirectly occur to him with the proportions of their circumscribed and\r\ninscribed spheres: he has immediately before his eyes that scholium of\r\nEuclid to the 18th proposition of his 13th Book, in which it is proved\r\nto be impossible that there should be, or be imagined, more than five\r\nregular bodies.\r\n\r\n\"What is worthy of admiration (since I had then no proof of any\r\nprerogatives of the bodies with regard to their order) is, that\r\nemploying a conjecture which was far from being subtle, derived from the\r\ndistances of the planets, I should at once attain my end so happily in\r\narranging them, that I was not able to change anything afterwards with\r\nthe utmost exercise of my reasoning powers. In memory of the event, I\r\nwrite down here for you the sentence, just as it fell from me, and in\r\nthe words in which it was that moment conceived:—The Earth is the\r\ncircle, the measurer of all; round it describe a dodecahedron, the\r\ncircle including this will be Mars. Round Mars describe a tetrahedron,\r\nthe circle including this will be Jupiter. Describe a cube round\r\nJupiter, the circle including this will be Saturn. Now, inscribe in the\r\nEarth an icosahedron, the circle inscribed in it will be Venus. Inscribe\r\nan octahedron in Venus, the circle inscribed in it will be Mercury. This\r\nis the reason of the number of the planets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"This was the cause, and such the success, of my labour: now read my\r\npropositions in this book. The intense pleasure I have received from\r\nthis discovery never can be told in words. I regretted no more the time\r\nwasted; I tired of no labour; I shunned no toll of reckoning; days and\r\nnights I spent in calculations; until I could see whether this opinion\r\nwould agree with the orbits of Copernicus, or whether my joy was to\r\nvanish into air. I willingly subjoin that sentiment of Archytas, as\r\ngiven by Cicero: 'If I could mount up into heaven, and thoroughly\r\nperceive the nature of the world, and beauty of the stars, that\r\nadmiration would be without a charm for me, unless I had some one like\r\nyou, reader, candid, attentive, and eager for knowledge, to whom to\r\ndescribe it.' If you acknowledge this feeling, and are candid, you will\r\nrefrain from blame, such as not without cause I anticipate; but if,\r\nleaving that to itself, you fear lest these things be not ascertained,\r\nand that I have shouted triumph before victory, at least approach these\r\npages, and learn the matter in consideration: you will not find, as just\r\nnow, new and unknown planets interposed; that boldness of mine is not\r\napproved, but those old ones very little loosened, and so furnished by\r\nthe interposition (however absurd you may think it) of rectilinear\r\nfigures, that in future you may give a reason to the rustics when they\r\nask for the hooks which keep the skies from falling.—Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nIn the third chapter Kepler mentions, that a thickness must be allowed\r\nto each orb sufficient to include the greatest and least distance of\r\nthe planet from the sun. The form and result of his comparison with the\r\nreal distances are as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                                               Book V.\r\n  If the   {Saturn } be taken {Jupiter = 577}              {635 Ch. 9\r\n  inner    {Jupiter} at 1000  {Mars    = 333} According to {333—14\r\n  Surface  {Mars   } then the {Earth   = 795} Copernicus   {757—19\r\n  of the   {Earth  } outer    {Venus   = 795}  they are    {794—21, 22\r\n  orbit of {Venus  } one of   {Mercury = 577}              {723—27\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that Kepler's results were far from being entirely\r\nsatisfactory; but he seems to have flattered himself, that the\r\ndifferences might be attributed to erroneous measurements. Indeed, the\r\nscience of observation was then so much in its infancy, that such an\r\nassertion might be made without incurring much risk of decisive\r\nrefutation.\r\n\r\nKepler next endeavoured to determine why the regular solids followed in\r\nthis rather than any other order; and his imagination soon created a\r\nvariety of essential distinctions between the cube, pyramid, and\r\ndodecahedron, belonging to the superior planets, and the other two.\r\n\r\nThe next question examined in the book, is the reason why the zodiac is\r\ndivided into 360 degrees; and on this subject, he soon becomes enveloped\r\nin a variety of subtle considerations, (not very intelligible in the\r\noriginal, and still more difficult to explain shortly to others\r\nunacquainted with it,) in relation to the divisions of the musical\r\nscale; the origin of which he identifies with his five favourite solids.\r\nThe twentieth chapter is appropriated to a more interesting inquiry,\r\ncontaining the first traces of his finally successful researches into\r\nthe proportion between the distances of the planets, and the times of\r\ntheir motions round the sun. He begins with the generally admitted fact,\r\nthat the more distant planets move more slowly; but in order to show\r\nthat the proportion, whatever it may be, is not the simple one of the\r\ndistances, he exhibits the following little Table:—\r\n\r\n        ♄\r\n  +--+--------+\r\n  |  |D. Scr. |  ♃\r\n  +--+--------+---------+\r\n  |♄ |10759.12| D. Scr. |   ♂\r\n  +--+--------+---------+--------+\r\n  |♃ | 6159   | 4332.37 |D. Scr. |   ♁\r\n  +--+--------+---------+--------+-------+\r\n  |♂ | 1785   | 1282    | 686.59 |D. Scr.|  ♀\r\n  +--+--------+---------+--------+-------+-------+\r\n  |♁ | 1174   |  843    | 452    |365.15 |D. Scr.|    ☿\r\n  +--+--------+---------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\r\n  |♀ |  844   |  606    | 325    |262.30 |224.42 | D. Scr. |\r\n  +--+--------+---------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\r\n  |☿ |  434   |  312    | 167    |135    |115    |  87.58  |\r\n\r\nAt the head of each vertical column is placed the real time (in days and\r\nsexagesimal parts) of the revolution of the planet placed above it, and\r\nunderneath the days due to the other inferior planets, if they observed\r\nthe proportion of distance. Hence it appears that this proportion in\r\nevery case gives a time greater than the truth; as for instance, if the\r\nearth's rate of revolution were to Jupiter's in the proportion of their\r\ndistances, the second column shows that the time of her period would be\r\n843 instead of 365¼ days; so of the rest. His next attempt was to\r\ncompare them by two by two, in which he found that he arrived at a\r\nproportion something like the proportion of the distances, although as\r\nyet far from obtaining it exactly. This process amounts to taking the\r\nquotients obtained by dividing the period of each planet by the period\r\nof the one next beyond.\r\n\r\n                     { ♄ 10759.27} be successively taken to { ♃ 403\r\n                     { ♃ 4332.37 } consist of 1000 equal    { ♂ 159\r\n                     { ♂ 686.59  } parts, the planet next   { ♁ 532\r\n  For if each of the { ♁ 365.15  } below will contain       { ♀ 615\r\n  periods of         { ♀ 244.42  } of those parts in        { ☿ 392\r\n\r\n  But if the distance of each planet in    { ♃ 572\r\n    succession be taken to consist of      { ♂ 290\r\n    1000 equal parts, the distance of      { ♁ 658\r\n    the next below will contain, according { ♀ 719\r\n    to Copernicus, in                      { ☿ 500\r\n\r\nFrom this table he argued that to make the proportions agree, we must\r\nassume one of two things, \"either that the moving intelligences of the\r\nplanets are weakest in those which are farthest from the Sun, or that\r\nthere is one moving intelligence in the Sun, the common centre forcing\r\nthem all round, but those most violently which are nearest, and that it\r\nlanguishes in some sort, and grows weaker at the most distant, because\r\nof the remoteness and the attenuation of the virtue.\"\r\n\r\nWe stop here to insert a note added by Kepler to the later editions, and\r\nshall take advantage of the same interruption to warn the reader not to\r\nconfound this notion of Kepler with the theory of a gravitating force\r\ntowards the Sun, in the sense in which we now use those words. According\r\nto our theory, the effect of the presence of the Sun upon the planet is\r\nto pull it towards the centre in a straight line, and the effect of the\r\nmotion thus produced combined with the motion of the planet, which if\r\nundisturbed would be in a straight line inclined to the direction of the\r\nradius, is, that it describes a curve round the Sun. Kepler considered\r\nhis planets as perfectly quiet and unwilling to move when left alone;\r\nand that this virtue supposed by him to proceed in every direction out\r\nof the Sun, swept them round, just as the sails of a windmill would\r\ncarry round anything which became entangled in them. In other parts of\r\nhis works Kepler mentions having speculated on a real attractive force\r\nin the centre; but as he knew that the planets are not always at the\r\nsame distance from the Sun, and conceived erroneously, that to remove\r\nthem from their least to their greatest distance a repulsive force must\r\nbe supposed alternating with an attractive one, he laid aside this\r\nnotion as improbable. In a note he acknowledges that when he wrote the\r\npassage just quoted, imbued as he then was with Scaliger's notions on\r\nmoving intelligences, he literally believed \"that each planet was moved\r\nby a living spirit, but afterwards came to look on the moving cause as a\r\ncorporeal though immaterial substance, something in the nature of light\r\nwhich is observed to diminish similarly at increased distances.\" He then\r\nproceeds as follows in the original text.\r\n\r\n\"Let us then assume, as is very probable, that motion is dispensed by\r\nthe sun in the same manner as light. The proportion in which light\r\nemanating from a centre is diminished, is taught by optical writers: for\r\nthere is the same quantity of light, or of the solar rays, in the small\r\ncircles as in the large; and therefore, as it is more condensed in the\r\nformer, more attenuated in the latter, a measure of the attenuation may\r\nbe derived from the proportion of the circles themselves, both in the\r\ncase of light and of the moving virtue. Therefore, by how much the orbit\r\nof Venus is greater than that of Mercury, in the same proportion will\r\nthe motion of the latter be stronger, or more hurried, or more swift, or\r\nmore powerful, or by whatever other word you like to express the fact,\r\nthan that of the former. But a larger orbit would require a\r\nproportionably longer time of revolution, even though the moving force\r\nwere the same. Hence it follows that the one cause of a greater distance\r\nof the planet from the Sun, produces a double effect in increasing the\r\nperiod, and conversely the increase of the periods will be double the\r\ndifference of the distances. Therefore, half the increment added to the\r\nshorter period ought to give the true proportion of the distances, so\r\nthat the sum should represent the distance of the superior planet, on\r\nthe same scale on which the shorter period represents the distance of\r\nthe interior one. For instance, the period of Mercury is nearly 88 days;\r\nthat of Venus is 224⅔, the difference is 136⅔: half of this is 68⅓,\r\nwhich, added to 88, gives 156⅓. The mean distance of Venus ought,\r\ntherefore, to be, in proportion to that of Mercury, as 156⅓ to 88. If\r\nthis be done with all the planets, we get the following results, taking\r\nsuccessively, as before, the distance of each planet at 1000.\r\n\r\n  The distance in parts of which } ♃ 574  But according { 572\r\n  the distance of the next       } ♂ 274  to Copernicus { 290\r\n  superior planet contains 1000, } ♁ 694  they are      { 658\r\n  is at                          } ♀ 762  respectively  { 719\r\n                                 } ☿ 563                { 500\r\n\r\nAs you see, we have now got nearer the truth.\"\r\n\r\nFinding that this theory of the rate of diminution would not bring him\r\nquite close to the result he desired to find, Kepler immediately\r\nimagined another. This latter occasioned him a great deal of perplexity,\r\nand affords another of the frequently recurring instances of the waste\r\nof time and ingenuity occasioned by his impetuous and precipitate\r\ntemperament. Assuming the distance of any planet, as for instance of\r\nMars, to be the unit of space, and the virtue at that distance to be the\r\nunit of force, he supposed that as many particles as the virtue at the\r\nEarth gained upon that of Mars, so many particles of distance did the\r\nEarth lose. He endeavoured to determine the respective positions of the\r\nplanets upon this theory, by the rules of false position, but was much\r\nastonished at finding the same exactly as on his former hypothesis. The\r\nfact was, as he himself discovered, although not until after several\r\nyears, that he had become confused in his calculation; and when half\r\nthrough the process, had retraced his steps so as of course to arrive\r\nagain at the numbers from which he started, and which he had taken from\r\nhis former results. This was the real secret of the identity of the two\r\nmethods; and if, when he had taken the distance of Mars at 1000, instead\r\nof assuming the distance of the earth at 694, as he did, he had taken\r\nany other number, and operated upon it in the same manner, he would\r\nhave had the same reason for relying on the accuracy of his supposition.\r\nAs it was, the result utterly confounded him; and he was obliged to\r\nleave it with the remark, that \"the two theories are thus proved to be\r\nthe same in fact, and only different in form; although how that can\r\npossibly be, I have never to this day been able to understand.\"—His\r\nperplexity was very reasonable; they are by no means the same; it was\r\nonly his method of juggling with the figures which seemed to connect\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all its faults, the genius and unwearied perseverance\r\ndisplayed by Kepler in this book, immediately ranked him among\r\nastronomers of the first class; and he received the most flattering\r\nencomiums from many of the most celebrated; among others, from Galileo\r\nand Tycho Brahe, whose opinion he invited upon his performance. Galileo\r\ncontented himself with praising in general terms the ingenuity and good\r\nfaith which appeared so conspicuously in it. Tycho Brahe entered into a\r\nmore detailed criticism of the work, and, as Kepler shrewdly remarked,\r\nshowed how highly he thought of it by advising him to try to adapt\r\nsomething of the same kind to the Tychonic system. Kepler also sent a\r\ncopy of his book to the imperial astronomer, Raimar, with a\r\ncomplimentary letter, in which he exalted him above all other\r\nastronomers of the age. Raimar had surreptitiously acquired a notion of\r\nTycho Brahe's theory, and published it as his own; and Tycho, in his\r\nletter, complained of Kepler's extravagant flattery. This drew a long\r\napologetical reply from Kepler, in which he attributed the admiration he\r\nhad expressed of Raimar to his own want of information at that time,\r\nhaving since met with many things in Euclid and Regiomontanus, which he\r\nthen believed original in Raimar. With this explanation, Tycho professed\r\nhimself perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[179] The following scrupulous note added by Kepler in 1621 to a\r\nsubsequent edition of this work, deserves to be quoted. It shows how\r\nentirely superior he was to the paltriness of attempting to appropriate\r\nthe discoveries of others, of which many of his contemporaries had\r\nexhibited instances even on slighter pretences than this passage might\r\nhave afforded him. The note is as follows: \"Not circulating round\r\nJupiter like the Medicæan stars. Be not deceived. I never had them in my\r\nthoughts, but, like the other primary planets, including the sun in the\r\ncentre of the system within their orbits.\"\r\n\r\n[180] This inconvenient mode of dating was necessary before the new or\r\nGregorian style was universally adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    _Kepler's Marriage—He joins Tycho Brahe at Prague—Is appointed\r\n      Imperial Mathematician—Treatise on the New Star._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE publication of this extraordinary book, early as it occurs in the\r\nhistory of Kepler's life, was yet preceded by his marriage. He had\r\ncontemplated this step so early as 1592; but that suit having been\r\nbroken off, he paid his addresses, in 1596, to Barbara Muller von\r\nMuhleckh. This lady was already a widow for the second time, although\r\ntwo years younger than Kepler himself. On occasion of this alliance he\r\nwas required to prove the nobility of his family, and the delay\r\nconsequent upon the inquiry postponed the marriage till the following\r\nyear. He soon became involved in difficulties in consequence of this\r\ninconsiderate engagement: his wife's fortune was less than he had been\r\nled to expect, and he became embroiled on that account with her\r\nrelations. Still more serious inconvenience resulted to him from the\r\ntroubled state in which the province of Styria was at that time, arising\r\nout of the disputes in Bohemia and the two great religious parties into\r\nwhich the empire was now divided, the one headed by Rodolph, the feeble\r\nminded emperor,—the other by Matthias, his ambitious and enterprising\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nIn the year following his marriage, he thought it prudent, on account of\r\nsome opinions he had unadvisedly promulgated, (of what nature does not\r\nvery distinctly appear,) to withdraw himself from Gratz into Hungary.\r\nThence he transmitted several short treatises to his friend Zehentmaier,\r\nat Tubingen—\"On the Magnet,\" \"On the Cause of the Obliquity of the\r\nEcliptic,\" and \"On the Divine Wisdom, as shown in the Creation.\" Little\r\nis known of these works beyond the notice taken of them in Zehentmaier's\r\nanswers. Kepler has himself told us, that his magnetic philosophy was\r\nbuilt upon the investigations of Gilbert, of whom he always justly spoke\r\nwith the greatest respect.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a more violent persecution had driven Tycho Brahe\r\nfrom his observatory of Uraniburg, in the little island of Hueen, at the\r\nentrance of the Baltic. This had been bestowed on him by the munificence\r\nof Frederick I. of Denmark, who liberally furnished him with every means\r\nof prosecuting his astronomical observations. After Frederick's death,\r\nTycho found himself unable to withstand the party which had constantly\r\nopposed him, and was forced, at a great loss and much inconvenience, to\r\nquit his favourite island. On the invitation of the emperor, Rudolph\r\nII., he then betook himself, after a short stay at Hamburg, to the\r\ncastle of Benach, near Prague, which was assigned to him with an annual\r\npension of three thousand florins, a truly munificent provision in those\r\ntimes and that country.\r\n\r\nKepler had been eager to see Tycho Brahe since the latter had intimated\r\nthat his observations had led him to a more accurate determination of\r\nthe excentricities of the orbits of the planets. By help of this, Kepler\r\nhoped that his theory might be made to accord more nearly with the\r\ntruth; and on learning that Tycho was in Bohemia, he immediately set out\r\nto visit him, and arrived at Prague in January, 1600. From thence he\r\nwrote a second letter to Tycho, not having received the answer to his\r\nformer apology, again excusing himself for the part he had appeared to\r\ntake with Raimar against him. Tycho replied immediately in the kindest\r\nmanner, and begged he would repair to him directly:—\"Come not as a\r\nstranger, but as a very welcome friend; come and share in my\r\nobservations with such instruments as I have with me, and as a dearly\r\nbeloved associate.\" During his stay of three or four months at Benach,\r\nit was settled that Tycho should apply to the emperor, to procure him\r\nthe situation of assistant in the observatory. Kepler then returned to\r\nGratz, having previously received an intimation, that he might do so in\r\nsafety. The plan, as it had been arranged between them was, that a\r\nletter should be procured from the emperor to the states of Styria,\r\nrequesting that Kepler might join Tycho Brahe for two years, and retain\r\nhis salary during that time: a hundred florins were to be added annually\r\nby the emperor, on account of the greater dearness of living at Prague.\r\nBut before everything was concluded, Kepler finally threw up his\r\nsituation at Gratz, in consequence of new dissensions. Fearing that this\r\nwould utterly put an end to his hopes of connecting himself with Tycho,\r\nhe determined to revive his claims on the patronage of the Duke of\r\nWirtemberg. With this view he entered into correspondence with Mästlin\r\nand some of his other friends at Tubingen, intending to prosecute his\r\nmedical studies, and offer himself for the professorship of medicine in\r\nthat university. He was dissuaded from this scheme by the pressing\r\ninstances of Tycho, who undertook to exert himself in procuring a\r\npermanent settlement for him from the emperor, and assured him, even if\r\nthat attempt should fail, that the language he had used when formerly\r\ninviting him to visit him at Hamburg, should not be forgotten. In\r\nconsequence of this encouragement, Kepler abandoned his former scheme,\r\nand travelled again with his wife to Prague. He was detained a long time\r\non the road by violent illness, and his money became entirely exhausted.\r\nOn this he wrote complainingly to Tycho, that he was unable without\r\nassistance to travel even the short distance which still separated them,\r\nfar less to await much longer the fulfilment of the promises held out to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBy his subsequent admissions, it appears that for a considerable time he\r\nlived entirely on Tycho's bounty, and by way of return, he wrote an\r\nessay against Raimar, and against a Scotchman named Liddell, professor\r\nat Rostoch and Helmstadt, who, like Raimar, had appropriated to himself\r\nthe credit of the Tychonic system. Kepler never adopted this theory, and\r\nindeed, as the question merely regarded priority of invention, there\r\ncould be no occasion, in the discussion, for an examination of its\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a transaction, not much to Kepler's credit, who in\r\nthe course of the following year, and during a second absence from\r\nPrague, fancied that he had some reason to complain of Tycho's\r\nbehaviour, and wrote him a violent letter, filled with reproaches and\r\ninsults. Tycho appears to have behaved in this affair with great\r\nmoderation: professing to be himself occupied with the marriage of his\r\ndaughter, he gave the care of replying to Kepler's charges, to Ericksen,\r\none of his assistants, who, in a very kind and temperate letter, pointed\r\nout to him the ingratitude of his behaviour, and the groundlessness of\r\nhis dissatisfaction. His principal complaint seems to have been, that\r\nTycho had not sufficiently supplied his wife with money during his\r\nabsence. Ericksen's letter produced an immediate and entire change in\r\nKepler's temper, and it is only from the humble recantation which he\r\ninstantaneously offered that we learn the extent of his previous\r\nviolence. \"Most noble Tycho,\" these are the words of his letter, \"how\r\nshall I enumerate or rightly estimate your benefits conferred on me! For\r\ntwo months you have liberally and gratuitously maintained me, and my\r\nwhole family; you have provided for all my wishes; you have done me\r\nevery possible kindness; you have communicated to me everything you hold\r\nmost dear; no one, by word or deed, has intentionally injured me in\r\nanything: in short, not to your children, your wife, or yourself have\r\nyou shown more indulgence than to me. This being so, as I am anxious to\r\nput upon record, I cannot reflect without consternation that I should\r\nhave been so given up by God to my own intemperance, as to shut my eyes\r\non all these benefits; that, instead of modest and respectful gratitude,\r\nI should indulge for three weeks in continual moroseness towards all\r\nyour family, in headlong passion, and the utmost insolence towards\r\nyourself, who possess so many claims on my veneration from your noble\r\nfamily, your extraordinary learning, and distinguished reputation.\r\nWhatever I have said or written against the person, the fame, the\r\nhonour, and the learning of your excellency; or whatever, in any other\r\nway, I have injuriously spoken or written, (if they admit no other more\r\nfavourable interpretation,) as to my grief I have spoken and written\r\nmany things, and more than I can remember; all and everything I recant,\r\nand freely and honestly declare and profess to be groundless, false, and\r\nincapable of proof.\" Hoffmann, the president of the states of Styria,\r\nwho had taken Kepler to Prague on his first visit, exerted himself to\r\nperfect the reconciliation, and this hasty quarrel was entirely passed\r\nover.\r\n\r\nOn Kepler's return to Prague, in September, 1601, he was presented to\r\nthe Emperor by Tycho, and honoured with the title of Imperial\r\nMathematician, on condition of assisting Tycho in his calculations.\r\nKepler desired nothing more than this condition, since Tycho was at that\r\ntime probably the only person in the world who possessed observations\r\nsufficient for the reform which he now began to meditate in the theory\r\nof astronomy. Rudolph appears to have valued both Tycho Brahe and Kepler\r\nas astrologers rather than astronomers; but although unable to\r\nappreciate rightly the importance of the task they undertook, of\r\ncompiling a new set of astronomical tables founded upon Tycho's\r\nobservations, yet his vanity was flattered with the prospect of his name\r\nbeing connected with such a work, and he made liberal promises to defray\r\nthe expense of the new Rudolphine Tables. Tycho's principal assistant at\r\nthis time was Longomontanus, who altered his name to this form,\r\naccording to the prevalent fashion of giving to every name a Latin\r\ntermination. Lomborg or Longbierg was the name, not of his family, but\r\nof the village in Denmark, where he was born, just as Müller was seldom\r\ncalled by any other name than Regiomontanus, from his native town\r\nKönigsberg, as George Joachim Rheticus was so surnamed from Rhetia, the\r\ncountry of the Grisons, and as Kepler himself was sometimes called\r\nLeonmontanus, from Leonberg, where he passed his infancy. It was agreed\r\nbetween Longomontanus and Kepler, that in discussing Tycho's\r\nobservations, the former should apply himself especially to the Moon,\r\nand the latter to Mars, on which planet, owing to its favourable\r\nposition, Tycho was then particularly engaged. The nature of these\r\nlabours will be explained when we come to speak of the celebrated book\r\n\"On the Motions of Mars.\"\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was disturbed by the return of Longomontanus into\r\nDenmark, where he had been offered an astronomical professorship, and\r\nstill more by the sudden death of Tycho Brahe himself in the following\r\nOctober. Kepler attended him during his illness, and after his death\r\nundertook to arrange some of his writings. But, in consequence of a\r\nmisunderstanding between him and Tycho's family, the manuscripts were\r\ntaken out of his hands; and when, soon afterwards, the book appeared,\r\nKepler complained heavily that they had published, without his consent\r\nor knowledge, the notes and interlineations added by him for his own\r\nprivate guidance whilst preparing it for publication.\r\n\r\nOn Tycho's death, Kepler succeeded him as principal mathematician to the\r\nemperor; but although he was thus nominally provided with a liberal\r\nsalary, it was almost always in arrear. The pecuniary embarrassments in\r\nwhich he constantly found himself involved, drove him to the resource of\r\ngaining a livelihood by casting nativities. His peculiar temperament\r\nrendered him not averse from such speculations, and he enjoyed\r\nconsiderable reputation in this line, and received ample remuneration\r\nfor his predictions. But although he did not scruple, when consulted, to\r\navail himself in this manner of the credulity of his contemporaries, he\r\npassed over few occasions in his works of protesting against the\r\nfutility of this particular genethliac astrology. His own astrological\r\ncreed was in a different strain, more singular, but not less\r\nextravagant. We shall defer entering into any details concerning it,\r\ntill we come to treat of his book on Harmonics, in which he has\r\ncollected and recapitulated the substance of his scattered opinions on\r\nthis strange subject.\r\n\r\nHis next works deserving notice are those published on occasion of the\r\nnew star which shone out with great splendour in 1604, in the\r\nconstellation Cassiopeia.[181] Immediately on its appearance, Kepler\r\nwrote a short account of it in German, marked with all the oddity which\r\ncharacterises most of his productions. We shall see enough of his\r\nastronomical calculations when we come to his book on Mars; the\r\nfollowing passage will probably be found more amusing.\r\n\r\nAfter comparing this star with that of 1572, and mentioning that many\r\npersons who had seen it maintained this to be the brighter of the two,\r\nsince it was nearly twice the size of its nearest neighbour, Jupiter, he\r\nproceeds as follows:—\"Yonder one chose for its appearance a time no way\r\nremarkable, and came into the world quite unexpectedly, like an enemy\r\nstorming a town, and breaking into the market-place before the citizens\r\nare aware of his approach; but ours has come exactly in the year of\r\nwhich astrologers have written so much about the fiery trigon that\r\nhappens in it;[182] just in the month in which (according to Cyprian)\r\nMars comes up to a very perfect conjunction with the other two superior\r\nplanets; just in the day when Mars has joined Jupiter, and just in the\r\nplace where this conjunction has taken place. Therefore the apparition\r\nof this star is not like a secret hostile irruption, as was that one of\r\n1572, but the spectacle of a public triumph, or the entry of a mighty\r\npotentate; when the couriers ride in some time before, to prepare his\r\nlodgings, and the crowd of young urchins begin to think the time\r\nover-long to wait: then roll in, one after another, the ammunition, and\r\nmoney, and baggage waggons, and presently the trampling of horse, and\r\nthe rush of people from every side to the streets and windows; and when\r\nthe crowd have gazed with their jaws all agape at the troops of knights;\r\nthen at last, the trumpeters, and archers, and lackeys, so distinguish\r\nthe person of the monarch, that there is no occasion to point him out,\r\nbut every one cries out of his own accord—'Here we have him!'—What it\r\nmay portend is hard to determine, and thus much only is certain, that it\r\ncomes to tell mankind either nothing at all, or high and weighty news,\r\nquite beyond human sense and understanding. It will have an important\r\ninfluence on political and social relations; not indeed by its own\r\nnature, but, as it were, accidentally through the disposition of\r\nmankind. First, it portends to the booksellers great disturbances, and\r\ntolerable gains; for almost every _Theologus_, _Philosophicus_,\r\n_Medicus_, and _Mathematicus_, or whoever else, having no laborious\r\noccupation intrusted to him, seeks his pleasure _in studiis_, will make\r\nparticular remarks upon it, and will wish to bring these remarks to the\r\nlight. Just so will others, learned and unlearned, wish to know its\r\nmeaning, and they will buy the authors who profess to tell them. I\r\nmention these things merely by way of example, because, although thus\r\nmuch can be easily predicted without great skill, yet may it happen just\r\nas easily, and in the same manner, that the vulgar, or whoever else is\r\nof easy faith, or it may be, crazy, may wish to exalt himself into a\r\ngreat prophet; or it may even happen that some powerful lord, who has\r\ngood foundation and beginning of great dignities, will be cheered on by\r\nthis phenomenon to venture on some new scheme, just as if God had set up\r\nthis star in the darkness merely to enlighten them.\"\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be supposed, from the tenor of this last passage, that\r\nthe writer of it was not a determined enemy to astrological predictions\r\nof every description. In 1602 he had published a disputation, not now\r\neasily met with, \"On the Principles of Astrology,\" in which it seems\r\nthat he treated the professed astrologers with great severity. The\r\nessence of this book is probably contained in the second treatise on the\r\nnew star, which he published in 1606.[183] In this volume he inveighs\r\nrepeatedly against the vanity and worthlessness of ordinary astrology,\r\ndeclaring at the same time, that the professors of that art know that\r\nthis judgment is pronounced by one well acquainted with its principles.\r\n\"For if the vulgar are to pronounce who is the best astrologer, my\r\nreputation is known to be of the highest order; if they prefer the\r\njudgment of the learned, they are already condemned. Whether they stand\r\nwith me in the eyes of the populace, or I fall with them before the\r\nlearned, in both cases I am in their ranks; I am on a level with them; I\r\ncannot be renounced.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory which Kepler proposed to substitute is intimated shortly in\r\nthe following passage: \"I maintain that the colours and aspects, and\r\nconjunctions of the planets, are impressed on the natures or faculties\r\nof sublunary things, and when they occur, that these are excited as well\r\nin forming as in moving the body over whose motion they preside. Now let\r\nno one conceive a prejudice that I am anxiously seeking to mend the\r\ndeplorable and hopeless cause of astrology by far-fetched subtilties and\r\nmiserable quibbling. I do not value it sufficiently, nor have I ever\r\nshunned having astrologers for my enemies. But a most unfailing\r\nexperience (as far as can be hoped in natural phenomena) of the\r\nexcitement of sublunary natures by the conjunctions and aspects of the\r\nplanets, has instructed and compelled my unwilling belief.\"\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting other topics suggested by this new star, he examines\r\nthe different opinions on the cause of its appearance. Among others he\r\nmentions the Epicurean notion, that it was a fortuitous concourse of\r\natoms, whose appearance in this form was merely one of the infinite\r\nnumber of ways in which, since the beginning of time, they have been\r\ncombined. Having descanted for some time on this opinion, and declared\r\nhimself altogether hostile to it, Kepler proceeds as follows:—\"When I\r\nwas a youth, with plenty of idle time on my hands, I was much taken with\r\nthe vanity, of which some grown men are not ashamed, of making anagrams,\r\nby transposing the letters of my name, written in Greek, so as to make\r\nanother sentence: out of Ιωάννης Κεπλῆρος I made Σειρήνων κάπηλος;[184]\r\nin Latin, out of _Joannes Keplerus_ came _Serpens in akuleo_.[185] But\r\nnot being satisfied with the meaning of these words, and being unable to\r\nmake another, I trusted the thing to chance, and taking out of a pack of\r\nplaying cards as many as there were letters in the name, I wrote one\r\nupon each, and then began to shuffle them, and at each shuffle to read\r\nthem in the order they came, to see if any meaning came of it. Now, may\r\nall the Epicurean gods and goddesses confound this same chance, which,\r\nalthough I spent a good deal of time over it, never showed me anything\r\nlike sense even from a distance.[186] So I gave up my cards to the\r\nEpicurean eternity, to be carried away into infinity, and, it is said,\r\nthey are still flying about there, in the utmost confusion among the\r\natoms, and have never yet come to any meaning. I will tell these\r\ndisputants, my opponents, not my own opinion, but my wife's. Yesterday,\r\nwhen weary with writing, and my mind quite dusty with considering these\r\natoms, I was called to supper, and a salad I had asked for was set\r\nbefore me. It seems then, said I aloud, that if pewter dishes, leaves of\r\nlettuce, grains of salt, drops of water, vinegar, and oil, and slices of\r\negg, had been flying about in the air from all eternity, it might at\r\nlast happen by chance that there would come a salad. Yes, says my wife,\r\nbut not so nice and well dressed as this of mine is.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[181] See Life of Galileo, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[182] The fiery trigon occurs about once in every 800 years, when\r\nSaturn, Jupiter, and Mars are in the three fiery signs, Aries, Leo, and\r\nSagittarius.\r\n\r\n[183] The copy of this work in the British Museum is Kepler's\r\npresentation copy to our James I.

His\r\nfamily was increasing, and he had little wherewith to support them\r\nbeyond the uncertain proceeds of his writings and nativities. His salary\r\nwas charged partly on the states of Silesia, partly on the imperial\r\ntreasury; but it was in vain that repeated orders were procured for the\r\npayment of the arrears due to him. The resources of the empire were\r\ndrained by the constant demands of an engrossing war, and Kepler had not\r\nsufficient influence to enforce his claims against those who thought\r\neven the smallest sum bestowed upon him ill spent, in fostering\r\nprofitless speculations. In consequence of this niggardliness, Kepler\r\nwas forced to postpone the publication of the Rudolphine Tables, which\r\nhe was engaged in constructing from his own and Tycho Brahe's\r\nobservations, and applied himself to other works of a less costly\r\ndescription. Among these may be mentioned a \"Treatise on Comets,\"\r\nwritten on occasion of one which appeared in 1607: in this he suggests\r\nthat they are planets moving in straight lines. The book published in\r\n1604, which he entitles \"A Supplement to Vitellion,\" may be considered\r\nas containing the first reasonable and consistent theory of optics,\r\nespecially in that branch of it usually termed dioptrics, which relates\r\nto the theory of vision through transparent substances. In it was first\r\nexplained the true use of the different parts of the eye, to the\r\nknowledge of which Baptista Porta had already approached very nearly,\r\nthough he stopped short of the accurate truth. Kepler remarked the\r\nidentity of the mechanism in the eye with that beautiful invention of\r\nPorta's, the camera obscura; showing, that the light which falls from\r\nexternal objects on the eye is refracted through a transparent\r\nsubstance, called, from its form and composition, the crystalline lens,\r\nand makes a picture on the fine net-work of nerves, called the retina,\r\nwhich lies at the back of the eye. The manner in which the existence of\r\nthis coloured picture on the retina causes to the individual the\r\nsensation of sight, belongs to a theory not purely physical; and beyond\r\nthis point Kepler did not attempt to go.\r\n\r\nThe direction into which rays of light (as they are usually called) are\r\nbent or refracted in passing through the air and other transparent\r\nsubstances or mediums, is discussed in this treatise at great length.\r\nTycho Brahe had been the first astronomer who recognized the necessity\r\nof making some allowance on this account in the observed heights of the\r\nstars. A long controversy arose on this subject between Tycho Brahe and\r\nRothman, the astronomer at Hesse Cassel, a man of unquestionable talent,\r\nbut of odd and eccentric habits. Neither was altogether in the right,\r\nalthough Tycho had the advantage in the argument. He failed however to\r\nestablish the true law of refraction, and Kepler has devoted a chapter\r\nto an examination of the same question. It is marked by precisely the\r\nsame qualities as those appearing so conspicuously in his astronomical\r\nwritings:—great ingenuity; wonderful perseverance; bad philosophy. That\r\nthis may not be taken solely upon assertion, some samples of it are\r\nsubjoined. The writings of the authors of this period are little read or\r\nknown at the present day; and it is only by copious extracts that any\r\naccurate notion can be formed of the nature and value of their labours.\r\nThe following tedious specimen of Kepler's mode of examining physical\r\nphenomena is advisedly selected to contrast with his astronomical\r\nresearches: though the luck and consequently the fame that attended his\r\ndivination were widely different on the two occasions, the method\r\npursued was the same. After commenting on the points of difference\r\nbetween Rothman and Tycho Brahe, Kepler proceeds to enumerate his own\r\nendeavours to discover the law of refraction.\r\n\r\n\"I did not leave untried whether, by assuming a horizontal refraction\r\naccording to the density of the medium, the rest would correspond with\r\nthe sines of the distances from the vertical direction, but calculation\r\nproved that it was not so: and indeed there was no occasion to have\r\ntried it, for thus the refractions would increase according to the same\r\nlaw in all mediums, which is contradicted by experiment.\r\n\r\n\"The same kind of objection may be brought against the cause of\r\nrefraction alleged by Alhazen and Vitellion. They say that the light\r\nseeks to be compensated for the loss sustained at the oblique impact; so\r\nthat in proportion as it is enfeebled by striking against the denser\r\nmedium, in the same degree does it restore its energy by approaching the\r\nperpendicular, that it may strike the bottom of the denser medium with\r\ngreater force; for those impacts are most forcible which are direct. And\r\nthey add some subtle notions, I know not what, how the motion of\r\nobliquely incident light is compounded of a motion perpendicular and a\r\nmotion parallel to the dense surface, and that this compound motion is\r\nnot destroyed, but only retarded by meeting the denser medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I tried another way of measuring the refraction, which should include\r\nthe density of the medium and the incidence: for, since a denser medium\r\nis the cause of refraction, it seems to be the same thing as if we were\r\nto prolong the depth of the medium in which the rays are refracted into\r\nas much space as would be filled by the denser medium under the force of\r\nthe rarer one.\r\n\r\n\"Let A be the place of the light, BC the surface of the denser medium,\r\nDE its bottom. Let AB, AG, AF be rays falling obliquely, which would\r\narrive at D, I, H, if the medium were uniform. But because it is denser,\r\nsuppose the bottom to be depressed to KL, determined by this that there\r\nis as much of the denser matter contained in the space DC as of the\r\nrarer in LC: and thus, on the sinking of the whole bottom DE, the points\r\nD, I, H, E will descend vertically to L, M, N, K. Join the points BL,\r\nGM, FN, cutting DE in O, P, Q; the refracted rays will be ABO, AGP,\r\nAFQ.\"—\"This method is refuted by experiment; it gives the refractions\r\nnear the perpendicular AC too great in respect of those near the\r\nhorizon. Whoever has leisure may verify this, either by calculation or\r\ncompasses. It may be added that the reasoning itself is not very\r\nsure-footed, and, whilst seeking to measure other things, scarcely takes\r\nin and comprehends itself.\" This reflection must not be mistaken for the\r\ndawn of suspicion that his examination of philosophical questions began\r\nnot altogether at the right end: it is merely an acknowledgment that he\r\nhad not yet contrived a theory with which he was quite satisfied before\r\nit was disproved by experiment.\r\n\r\nAfter some experience of Kepler's miraculous good fortune in seizing\r\ntruths across the wildest and most absurd theories, it is not easy to\r\nkeep clear of the opposite feeling of surprise whenever any of his\r\nextravagancies fail to discover to him some beautiful law of nature. But\r\nwe must follow him as he plunges deeper in this unsuccessful inquiry;\r\nand the reader must remember, in order fully to appreciate this method\r\nof philosophizing, that it is almost certain that Kepler laboured upon\r\nevery one of the gratuitous suppositions that he makes, until positive\r\nexperiment satisfied him of their incorrectness.\r\n\r\n\"I go on to other methods. Since density is clearly connected with the\r\ncause of the refractions, and refraction itself seems a kind of\r\ncompression of light, as it were, towards the perpendicular, it occurred\r\nto me to examine whether there was the same proportion between the\r\nmediums in respect of density and the parts of the bottom illuminated by\r\nthe light, when let into a vessel, first empty, and afterwards filled\r\nwith water. This mode branches out into many: for the proportion may be\r\nimagined, either in the straight lines, as if one should say that the\r\nline EQ, illuminated by refraction, is to EH illuminated directly, as\r\nthe density of the one medium is to that of the other—Or another may\r\nsuppose the proportion to be between FC and FH—Or it may be conceived\r\nto exist among surfaces, or so that some power of EQ should be to some\r\npower of EH in this proportion, or the circles or similar figures\r\ndescribed on them. In this manner the proportion of EQ to EP would be\r\ndouble that of EH to EI—Or the proportion may be conceived existing\r\namong the solidities of the pyramidal frustums FHEC, FQEC—Or, since the\r\nproportion of the mediums involves a threefold consideration, since they\r\nhave density in length, breadth, and thickness, I proceeded also to\r\nexamine the cubic proportions among the lines EQ, EH.\r\n\r\n\"I also considered other lines. From any of the points of refraction as\r\nG, let a perpendicular GY be dropped upon the bottom. It may become a\r\nquestion whether possibly the triangle IGY, that is, the base IY, is\r\ndivided by the refracted ray GP, in the proportion of the densities of\r\nthe mediums.\r\n\r\n\"I have put all these methods here together, because the same remark\r\ndisproves them all. For, in whatever manner, whether as line, plane, or\r\npyramid, EI observes a given proportion to EP, or the abbreviated line\r\nYI to YP, namely, the proportion of the mediums, it is sure that EI, the\r\ntangent of the distance of the point A from the vertex, will become\r\ninfinite, and will, therefore make EP or YP, also infinite. Therefore,\r\nIGP, the angle of refraction, will be entirely lost; and, as it\r\napproaches the horizon, will gradually become less and less, which is\r\ncontrary to experiment.\r\n\r\n\"I tried again whether the images are equally removed from their points\r\nof refraction, and whether the ratio of the densities measures the least\r\ndistance. For instance, supposing E to be the image, C the surface of\r\nthe water, K the bottom, and CE to CK in the proportion of the densities\r\nof the mediums. Now, let F, G, B, be three other points of refraction\r\nand images at S, T, V, and let CE be equal to FS, GT, and BV. But\r\naccording to this rule an image E would still be somewhat raised in the\r\nperpendicular AK, which is contrary to experiment, not to mention other\r\ncontradictions. Thirdly, whether the proportion of the mediums holds\r\nbetween FH and FX, supposing H to be the place of the image? Not at all.\r\nFor so, CE would be in the same proportion to CK, so that the height of\r\nthe image would always be the same, which we have just refuted.\r\nFourthly, whether the raising of the image at E is to the raising at H,\r\nas CE to FH? Not in the least; for so the images either would never\r\nbegin to be raised, or, having once begun, would at last be infinitely\r\nraised, because FH at last becomes infinite. Fifthly, whether the images\r\nrise in proportion to the sines of the inclinations? Not at all; for so\r\nthe proportion of ascent would be the same in all mediums. Sixthly, are\r\nthen the images raised at first, and in perpendicular radiation,\r\naccording to the proportion of the mediums, and do they subsequently\r\nrise more and more according to the sines of the inclinations? For so\r\nthe proportion would be compound, and would become different in\r\ndifferent mediums. There is nothing in it: for the calculation disagreed\r\nwith experiment. And generally it is in vain to have regard to the image\r\nor the place of the image, for that very reason, that it is imaginary.\r\nFor there is no connexion between the density of the medium or any real\r\nquality or refraction of the light, and an accident of vision, by an\r\nerror of which the image happens.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this point, therefore, I had followed a nearly blind mode of\r\ninquiry, and had trusted to good fortune; but now I opened the other\r\neye, and hit upon a sure method, for I pondered the fact, that the image\r\nof a thing seen under water approaches closely to the true ratio of the\r\nrefraction, and almost measures it; that it is low if the thing is\r\nviewed directly from above; that by degrees it rises as the eye passes\r\ntowards the horizon of the water. Yet, on the other hand, the reason\r\nalleged above, proves that the measure is not to be sought in the image,\r\nbecause the image is not a thing actually existing, but arises from a\r\ndeception of vision which is purely accidental. By a comparison of these\r\nconflicting arguments, it occurred to me at length, to seek the causes\r\nthemselves of the existence of the image under water, and in these\r\ncauses the measure of the refractions. This opinion was strengthened in\r\nme by seeing that opticians had not rightly pointed out the cause of the\r\nimage which appears both in mirrors and in water. And this was the\r\norigin of that labour which I undertook in the third chapter. Nor,\r\nindeed, was that labour trifling, whilst hunting down false opinions of\r\nall sorts among the principles, in a matter rendered so intricate by the\r\nfalse traditions of optical writers; whilst striking out half a dozen\r\ndifferent paths, and beginning anew the whole business. How often did it\r\nhappen that a rash confidence made me look upon that which I sought with\r\nsuch ardour, as at length discovered!\r\n\r\n\"At length I cut this worse than Gordian knot of catoptrics by analogy\r\nalone, by considering what happens in mirrors, and what must happen\r\nanalogically in water. In mirrors, the image appears at a distance from\r\nthe real place of the object, not being itself material, but produced\r\nsolely by reflection at the polished surface. Whence it followed in\r\nwater also, that the images rise and approach the surface, not according\r\nto the law of the greater or less density in the water, as the view is\r\nless or more oblique, but solely because of the refraction of the ray of\r\nlight passing from the object to the eye. On which assumption, it is\r\nplain that every attempt I had hitherto made to measure refractions by\r\nthe image, and its elevation, must fall to the ground. And this became\r\nmore evident when I discovered the true reason why the image is in the\r\nsame perpendicular line with the object both in mirrors and in dense\r\nmediums. When I had succeeded thus far by analogy in this most difficult\r\ninvestigation, as to the place of the image, I began to follow out the\r\nanalogy further, led on by the strong desire of measuring refraction.\r\nFor I wished to get hold of some measure of some sort, no matter how\r\nblindly, having no fear but that so soon as the measure should be\r\naccurately known, the cause would plainly appear. I went to work as\r\nfollows. In convex mirrors the image is diminished, and just so in rarer\r\nmediums; in denser mediums it is magnified, as in concave mirrors. In\r\nconvex mirrors the central parts of the image approach, and recede in\r\nconcave farther than towards the circumference; the same thing happens\r\nin different mediums, so that in water the bottom appears depressed, and\r\nthe surrounding parts elevated. Hence it appears that a denser medium\r\ncorresponds with a concave reflecting surface, and a rarer one with a\r\nconvex one: it was clear, at the same time, that the plane surface of\r\nthe water affects a property of curvature. I was, therefore, to\r\nexcogitate causes consistent with its having this effect of curvature,\r\nand to see if a reason could be given, why the parts of the water\r\nsurrounding the incident perpendicular should represent a greater\r\ndensity than the parts just under the perpendicular. And so the thing\r\ncame round again to my former attempts, which being refuted by reason\r\nand experiment, I was forced to abandon the search after a cause. I then\r\nproceeded to measurements.\"\r\n\r\nKepler then endeavoured to connect his measurements of different\r\nquantities of refraction with the conic sections, and was tolerably well\r\npleased with some of his results. They were however not entirely\r\nsatisfactory, on which he breaks off with the following sentence: \"Now,\r\nreader, you and I have been detained sufficiently long whilst I have\r\nbeen attempting to collect into one faggot the measure of different\r\nrefractions: I acknowledge that the cause cannot be connected with this\r\nmode of measurement: for what is there in common between refractions\r\nmade at the plane surfaces of transparent mediums, and mixtilinear conic\r\nsections? Wherefore, _quod Deus bene vortat_, we will now have had\r\nenough of the causes of this measure; and although, even now, we are\r\nperhaps erring something from the truth, yet it is better, by working\r\non, to show our industry, than our laziness by neglect.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great length of this extract, we must add the\r\nconcluding paragraph of the Chapter, directed, as we are told in the\r\nmargin, against the \"Tychonomasticks:\"—\r\n\r\n\"I know how many blind men at this day dispute about colours, and how\r\nthey long for some one to give some assistance by argument to their rash\r\ninsults of Tycho, and attacks upon this whole matter of refractions;\r\nwho, if they had kept to themselves their puerile errors and naked\r\nignorance, might have escaped censure; for that may happen to many great\r\nmen. But since they venture forth publicly, and with thick books and\r\nsounding titles, lay baits for the applause of the unwary, (for\r\nnow-a-days there is more danger from the abundance of bad books, than\r\nheretofore from the lack of good ones,) therefore let them know that a\r\ntime is set for them publicly to amend their own errors. If they longer\r\ndelay doing this, it shall be open, either to me or any other, to do to\r\nthese unhappy meddlers in geometry as they have taken upon themselves to\r\ndo with respect to men of the highest reputation. And although this\r\nlabour will be despicable, from the vile nature of the follies against\r\nwhich it will be directed, yet so much more necessary than that which\r\nthey have undertaken against others, as he is a greater public nuisance,\r\nwho endeavours to slander good and necessary inventions, than he who\r\nfancies he has found what is impossible to discover. Meanwhile, let them\r\ncease to plume themselves on the silence which is another word for their\r\nown obscurity.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Kepler failed, as we have seen, to detect the true law of\r\nrefraction, (which was discovered some years later by Willibrord Snell,\r\na Flemish mathematician,) there are many things well deserving notice in\r\nhis investigations. He remarked, that the quantity of refraction would\r\nalter, if the height of the atmosphere should vary; and also, that it\r\nwould be different at different temperatures. Both these sources of\r\nvariation are now constantly taken into account, the barometer and\r\nthermometer giving exact indications of these changes. There is also a\r\nvery curious passage in one of his letters to Bregger, written in 1605,\r\non the subject of the colours in the rainbow. It is in these\r\nwords:—\"Since every one sees a different rainbow, it is possible that\r\nsome one may see a rainbow in the very place of my sight. In this case,\r\nthe medium is coloured at the place of my vision, to which the solar ray\r\ncomes to me through water, rain, or aqueous vapours. For the rainbow is\r\nseen when the sun is shining between rain, that is to say, when the sun\r\nalso is visible. Why then do I not see the sun green, yellow, red, and\r\nblue, if vision takes place according to the mode of illumination? I\r\nwill say something for you to attack or examine. The sun's rays are not\r\ncoloured, except with a definite quantity of refraction. Whether you are\r\nin the optical chamber, or standing opposite glass globes, or walking in\r\nthe morning dew, everywhere it is obvious that a certain and definite\r\nangle is observed, under which, when seen in dew, in glass, in water,\r\nthe sun's splendour appears coloured, and under no other angle. There is\r\nno colouring by mere reflexion, without the refraction of a denser\r\nmedium.\" How closely does Kepler appear, in this passage, to approach\r\nthe discovery which forms not the least part of Newton's fame!\r\n\r\nWe also find in this work a defence of the opinion that the planets are\r\nluminous of themselves; on the ground that the inferior planets would,\r\non the contrary supposition, display phases like those of the moon when\r\npassing between us and the sun. The use of the telescope was not then\r\nknown; and, when some years later the form of the disk of the planets\r\nwas more clearly defined with their assistance, Kepler had the\r\nsatisfaction of finding his assertions verified by the discoveries of\r\nGalileo, that these changes do actually take place. In another of his\r\nspeculations, connected with the same subject, he was less fortunate. In\r\n1607 a black spot appeared on the face of sun, such as may almost always\r\nbe seen with the assistance of the telescope, although they are seldom\r\nlarge enough to be visible to the unassisted eye. Kepler saw it for a\r\nshort time, and mistook it for the planet Mercury, and with his usual\r\nprecipitancy hastened to publish an account of his observation of this\r\nrare phenomenon. A few years later, Galileo discovered with his glasses,\r\na great number of similar spots; and Kepler immediately retracted the\r\nopinion announced in his treatise, and acknowledged his belief that\r\nprevious accounts of the same occurrence which he had seen in old\r\nauthors, and which he had found great difficulty in reconciling with his\r\nmore accurate knowledge of the motions of Mercury, were to be referred\r\nto a like mistake. On this occasion of the invention of the telescope,\r\nKepler's candour and real love of truth appeared in a most favourable\r\nlight. Disregarding entirely the disagreeable necessity, in consequence\r\nof the discoveries of this new instrument, of retracting several\r\nopinions which he had maintained with considerable warmth, he ranged\r\nhimself at once on the side of Galileo, in opposition to the bitter and\r\ndetermined hostility evinced by most of those whose theories were\r\nendangered by the new views thus offered of the heavens. Kepler's\r\nquarrel with his pupil, Horky, on this account, has been mentioned in\r\nthe \"Life of Galileo;\" and this is only a selected instance from the\r\nnumerous occasions on which he espoused the same unpopular side of the\r\nargument. He published a dissertation to accompany Galileo's\r\n\"Intelligencer of the Stars,\" in which he warmly expressed his\r\nadmiration of that illustrious inquirer into nature. His conduct in this\r\nrespect was the more remarkable, as some of his most intimate friends\r\nhad taken a very opposite view of Galileo's merit, and seem to have\r\nlaboured much to disturb their mutual regard; Mästlin especially,\r\nKepler's early instructor, seldom mentioned to him the name of Galileo,\r\nwithout some contemptuous expression of dislike. These statements have\r\nrather disturbed the chronological order of the account of Kepler's\r\nworks. We now return to the year 1609, in which he published his great\r\nand extraordinary book, \"On the Motions of Mars;\" a work which holds the\r\nintermediate place, and is in truth the connecting link, between the\r\ndiscoveries of Copernicus and Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    _Sketch of the Astronomical Theories before Kepler._\r\n\r\n\r\nKEPLER had begun to labour upon these commentaries from the moment when\r\nhe first made Tycho's acquaintance; and it is on this work that his\r\nreputation should be made mainly to rest. It is marked in many places\r\nwith his characteristic precipitancy, and indeed one of the most\r\nimportant discoveries announced in it (famous among astronomers by the\r\nname of the Equable Description of Areas) was blundered upon by a lucky\r\ncompensation of errors, of the nature of which Kepler remained ignorant\r\nto the very last. Yet there is more of the inductive method in this than\r\nin any of his other publications; and the unwearied perseverance with\r\nwhich he exhausted years in hunting down his often renewed theories,\r\ntill at length he seemed to arrive at the true one, almost by having\r\npreviously disproved every other, excites a feeling of astonishment\r\nnearly approaching to awe. It is wonderful how he contrived to retain\r\nhis vivacity and creative fancy amongst the clouds of figures which he\r\nconjured up round him; for the slightest hint or shade of probability\r\nwas sufficient to plunge him into the midst of the most laborious\r\ncomputations. He was by no means an accurate calculator, according to\r\nthe following character which he has given of himself:—\"Something of\r\nthese delays must be attributed to my own temper, for _non omnia\r\npossumus omnes_, and I am totally unable to observe any order; what I do\r\nsuddenly, I do confusedly, and if I produce any thing well arranged, it\r\nhas been done ten times over. Sometimes an error of calculation\r\ncommitted by hurry, delays me a great length of time. I could indeed\r\npublish an infinity of things, for though my reading is confined, my\r\nimagination is abundant, but I grow dissatisfied with such confusion: I\r\nget disgusted and out of humour, and either throw them away, or put them\r\naside to be looked at again; or, in other words, to be written again,\r\nfor that is generally the end of it. I entreat you, my friends, not to\r\ncondemn me for ever to grind in the mill of mathematical calculations:\r\nallow me some time for philosophical speculations, my only delight.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very seldom able to afford the expense of maintaining an\r\nassistant, and was forced to go through most of the drudgery of his\r\ncalculations by himself; and the most confirmed and merest arithmetician\r\ncould not have toiled more doggedly than Kepler did in the work of which\r\nwe are about to speak.\r\n\r\nIn order that the language of his astronomy may be understood, it is\r\nnecessary to mention briefly some of the older theories. When it had\r\nbeen discovered that the planets did not move regularly round the earth,\r\nwhich was supposed to be fixed in the centre of the world, a mechanism\r\nwas contrived by which it was thought that the apparent irregularity\r\ncould be represented, and yet the principle of uniform motion, which was\r\nadhered to with superstitious reverence, might be preserved. This, in\r\nits simplest form, consisted in supposing the planet to move uniformly\r\nin a small circle, called an _epicycle_, the centre of which moved with\r\nan equal angular motion in the opposite direction round the earth.[187]\r\nThe circle D_d_, described by D, the centre of the epicycle, was called\r\nthe _deferent_. For instance, if the planet was supposed to be at A when\r\nthe centre of the epicycle was at D, its position, when the centre of\r\nthe epicycle had removed to _d_, would be at _p_, found by drawing _dp_\r\nparallel to DA. Thus, the angle _adp_, measuring the motion of the\r\nplanet in its epicycle, would be equal to DE_d_, the angle described by\r\nthe centre of the epicycle in the deferent. The angle _p_E_d_ between\r\nE_p_, the direction in which a planet so moving would be seen from the\r\nearth, supposed to be at E, and E_d_ the direction in which it would\r\nhave been seen had it been moving in the centre of the deferent, was\r\ncalled the equation of the orbit, the word equation, in the language of\r\nastronomy, signifying what must be added or taken from an irregularly\r\nvarying quantity to make it vary uniformly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs the accuracy of observations increased, minor irregularities were\r\ndiscovered, which were attempted to be accounted for by making a second\r\ndeferent of the epicycle, and making the centre of a second epicycle\r\nrevolve in the circumference of the first, and so on, or else by\r\nsupposing the revolution in the epicycle not to be completed in exactly\r\nthe time in which its centre is carried round the deferent. Hipparchus\r\nwas the first to make a remark by which the geometrical representation\r\nof these inequalities was considerably simplified. In fact, if EC be\r\ntaken equal to _pd_, C_d_ will be a parallelogram, and consequently\r\nC_p_ equal to E_d_, so that the machinery of the first deferent and\r\nepicycle amounts to supposing that the planet revolves uniformly in a\r\ncircle round the point C, not coincident with the place of the earth.\r\nThis was consequently called the excentric theory, in opposition to the\r\nformer or concentric one, and was received as a great improvement. As\r\nthe point _d_ is not represented by this construction, the equation to\r\nthe orbit was measured by the angle C_p_E, which is equal to _p_E_d_. It\r\nis not necessary to give any account of the manner in which the old\r\nastronomers determined the magnitudes and positions of these orbits,\r\neither in the concentric or excentric theory, the present object being\r\nlittle more than to explain the meaning of the terms it will be\r\nnecessary to use in describing Kepler's investigations.\r\n\r\nTo explain the irregularities observed in the other planets, it became\r\nnecessary to introduce another hypothesis, in adopting which the\r\nseverity of the principle of uniform motion was somewhat relaxed. The\r\nmachinery consisted partly of an excentric deferent round E, the earth,\r\nand on it an epicycle, in which the planet revolved uniformly; but the\r\ncentre of the epicycle, instead of revolving uniformly round C, the\r\ncentre of the deferent, as it had hitherto been made to do, was\r\nsupposed to move in its circumference with an uniform angular motion\r\nround a third point, Q; the necessary effect of which supposition was,\r\nthat the linear motion of the centre of the epicycle ceased to be\r\nuniform. There were thus three points to be considered within the\r\ndeferent; E, the place of the earth; C, the centre of the deferent, and\r\nsometimes called the centre of the orbit; and Q, called the centre of\r\nthe equant, because, if any circle were described round Q, the planet\r\nwould appear to a spectator at Q, to be moving equably in it. It was\r\nlong uncertain what situation should be assigned to the centre of the\r\nequant, so as best to represent the irregularities to a spectator on the\r\nearth, until Ptolemy decided on placing it (in every case but that of\r\nMercury, the observations on which were very doubtful) so that C, the\r\ncentre of the orbit, lay just half way in the straight line, joining Q,\r\nthe centre of equable motion, and E, the place of the earth. This is the\r\nfamous principle, known by the name of the bisection of the\r\nexcentricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first equation required for the planet's motion was thus supposed to\r\nbe due to the displacement of E, the earth, from Q, the centre of\r\nuniform motion, which was called the excentricity of the equant: it\r\nmight be represented by the angle _d_EM, drawing EM parallel to Q_d_;\r\nfor clearly M would have been the place of the centre of the epicycle at\r\nthe end of a time proportional to D_d_, had it moved with an equable\r\nangular motion round E instead of Q. This angle _d_EM, or its equal\r\nE_d_Q, was called the equation of the centre (_i.e._ of the centre of\r\nthe epicycle); and is clearly greater than if EQ, the excentricity of\r\nthe equant, had been no greater than EC, called the excentricity of the\r\norbit. The second equation was measured by the angle subtended at E by\r\n_d_, the centre of the epicycle, and _p_ the planet's place in its\r\ncircumference: it was called indifferently the equation of the orbit, or\r\nof the argument. In order to account for the apparent stations and\r\nretrogradations of the planets, it became necessary to suppose that many\r\nrevolutions in the latter were completed during one of the former. The\r\nvariations of latitude of the planets were exhibited by supposing not\r\nonly that the planes of their deferents were oblique to the plane of the\r\necliptic, and that the plane of the epicycle was also oblique to that of\r\nthe deferent, but that the inclination of the two latter was continually\r\nchanging, although Kepler doubts whether this latter complication was\r\nadmitted by Ptolemy. In the inferior planets, it was even thought\r\nnecessary to give to the plane of the epicycle two oscillatory motions\r\non axes at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers at this period were much struck with a remarkable\r\nconnexion between the revolutions of the superior planets in their\r\nepicycles, and the apparent motion of the sun; for when in conjunction\r\nwith the sun, as seen from the earth, they were always found to be in\r\nthe apogee, or point of greatest distance from the earth, of their\r\nepicycle; and when in opposition to the Sun, they were as regularly in\r\nthe perigee, or point of nearest approach of the epicycle. This\r\ncorrespondence between two phenomena, which, according to the old\r\nastronomy, were entirely unconnected, was very perplexing, and it seems\r\nto have been one of the facts which led Copernicus to substitute the\r\ntheory of the earth's motion round the sun.\r\n\r\nAs time wore on, the superstructure of excentrics and epicycles, which\r\nhad been strained into representing the appearances of the heavens at a\r\nparticular moment, grew out of shape, and the natural consequence of\r\nsuch an artificial system was, that it became next to impossible to\r\nforesee what ruin might be produced in a remote part of it by any\r\nattempt to repair the derangements and refit the parts to the changes,\r\nas they began to be remarked in any particular point. In the ninth\r\ncentury of our era, Ptolemy's tables were already useless, and all those\r\nthat were contrived with unceasing toil to supply their place, rapidly\r\nbecame as unserviceable as they. Still the triumph of genius was seen in\r\nthe veneration that continued to be paid to the assumptions of Ptolemy\r\nand Hipparchus; and even when the great reformer, Copernicus, appeared,\r\nhe did not for a long time intend to do more than slightly modify their\r\nprinciples. That which he found difficult in the Ptolemaic system, was\r\nnone of the inconveniences by which, since the establishment of the new\r\nsystem, it has become common to demonstrate the inferiority of the old\r\none; it was the displacement of the centre of the equant from the centre\r\nof the orbit that principally indisposed him against it, and led him to\r\nendeavour to represent the appearances by some other combinations of\r\nreally uniform circular motions.\r\n\r\nThere was an old system, called the Egyptian, according to which Saturn,\r\nJupiter, Mars, and the Sun circulated round the earth, the sun carrying\r\nwith it, as two moons or satellites, the other two planets, Venus and\r\nMercury. This system had never entirely lost credit: it had been\r\nmaintained in the fifth century by Martianus Capella[188], and indeed it\r\nwas almost sanctioned, though not formally taught, by Ptolemy himself,\r\nwhen he made the mean motion of the sun the same as that of the centres\r\nof the epicycles of both these planets. The remark which had also been\r\nmade by the old astronomers, of the connexion between the motion of the\r\nsun and the revolutions of the superior planets in their epicycles, led\r\nhim straight to the expectation that he might, perhaps, produce the\r\nuniformity he sought by extending the Egyptian system to these also, and\r\nthis appears to have been the shape in which his reform was originally\r\nprojected. It was already allowed that the centre of the orbits of all\r\nthe planets was not coincident with the earth, but removed from it by\r\nthe space EC. This first change merely made EC the same for all the\r\nplanets, and equal to the mean distance of the earth from the sun. This\r\nsystem afterwards acquired great celebrity through its adoption by Tycho\r\nBrahe, who believed it originated with himself. It might perhaps have\r\nbeen at this period of his researches, that Copernicus was struck with\r\nthe passages in the Latin and Greek authors, to which he refers as\r\ntestifying the existence of an old belief in the motion of the earth\r\nround the sun. He immediately recognised how much this alteration would\r\nfurther his principles of uniformity, by referring all the planetary\r\nmotions to one centre, and did not hesitate to embrace it. The idea of\r\nexplaining the daily and principal apparent motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies by the revolution of the earth on its axis, would be the\r\nconcluding change, and became almost a necessary consequence of his\r\nprevious improvements, as it was manifestly at variance with his\r\nprinciples to give to all the planets and starry worlds a rapid daily\r\nmotion round the centre of the earth, now that the latter was removed\r\nfrom its former supposed post in the centre of the universe, and was\r\nitself carried with an annual motion round another fixed point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe reader would, however, form an inaccurate notion of the system of\r\nCopernicus, if he supposed that it comprised no more than the theory\r\nthat each planet, including the earth among them, revolved in a simple\r\ncircular orbit round the sun. Copernicus was too well acquainted with\r\nthe motions of the heavenly bodies, not to be aware that such orbits\r\nwould not accurately represent them; the motion he attributed to the\r\nearth round the sun, was at first merely intended to account for those\r\nwhich were called the second inequalities of the planets, according to\r\nwhich they appear one while to move forwards, then backwards, and at\r\nintermediate periods, stationary, and which thenceforward were also\r\ncalled the optical equations, as being merely an optical illusion. With\r\nregard to what were called the first inequalities, or physical\r\nequations, arising from a real inequality of motion, he still retained\r\nthe machinery of the deferent and epicycle; and all the alteration he\r\nattempted in the orbits of the superior planets was an extension of the\r\nconcentric theory to supply the place of the equant, which he considered\r\nthe blot of the system. His theory for this purpose is shown in the\r\naccompanying diagram, where S represents the sun, D_d_, the deferent or\r\nmean orbit of the planet, on which revolves the centre of the great\r\nepicycle, whose radius, DF, was taken at ¾ of Ptolemy's excentricity of\r\nthe equant; and round the circumference of this revolved, in the\r\nopposite direction, the centre of the little epicycle, whose radius, FP,\r\nwas made equal to the remaining ¼ of the excentricity of the equant.\r\n\r\nThe planet P revolved in the circumference of the little epicycle, in\r\nthe same direction with the centre of the great epicycle in the\r\ncircumference of the deferent, but with a double angular velocity. The\r\nplanet was supposed to be in the perigee of the little epicycle, when\r\nits centre was in the apogee of the greater; and whilst, for instance, D\r\nmoved equably though the angle DS_d_, F moved through _hdf_ = DS_d_, and\r\nP through _rfp_ = 2 DS_d_.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show that this construction gives nearly the same result\r\nas Ptolemy's; for the deferent and great epicycle have been already\r\nshown exactly equivalent to an excentric circle round S, and indeed\r\nCopernicus latterly so represented it: the effect of his construction,\r\nas given above, may therefore be reproduced in the following simpler\r\nform, in which only the smaller epicycle is retained:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn this construction, the place of the planet is found at the end of any\r\ntime proportional to F _f_ by drawing _fr_ parallel to SF, and taking\r\n_rfp_ = 2F _of_. Hence it is plain, if we take OQ, equal to FP, (already\r\nassumed equal to ¼ of Ptolemy's excentricity of the equant,) since SO is\r\nequal to ¾ of the same, that SQ is the whole of Ptolemy's excentricity\r\nof the equant; and therefore, that Q is the position of the centre of\r\nhis equant. It is also plain if we join Q_p_, since _rfp_ = 2F _of_, and\r\n_o_Q = _fp_, that _p_Q is parallel to _fo_, and, therefore, _p_QP is\r\nproportional to the time; so that the planet moves uniformly about the\r\nsame point Q, as in Ptolemy's theory; and if we bisect SQ in C, which is\r\nthe position of the centre of Ptolemy's deferent, the planet will,\r\naccording to Copernicus, move very nearly, though not exactly, in the\r\nsame circle, whose radius is CP, as that given by the simple excentric\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe explanation offered by Copernicus, of the motions of the inferior\r\nplanets, differed again in form from that of the others. He here\r\nintroduced what was called a _hypocycle_, which, in fact, was nothing\r\nbut a deferent not including the sun, round which the centre of the\r\norbit revolved. An epicycle in addition to the hypocycle was introduced\r\ninto Mercury's orbit. In this epicycle he was not supposed to revolve,\r\nbut to librate, or move up and down in its diameter. Copernicus had\r\nrecourse to this complication to satisfy an erroneous assertion of\r\nPtolemy with regard to some of Mercury's inequalities. He also retained\r\nthe oscillatory motions ascribed by Ptolemy to the planes of the\r\nepicycles, in order to explain the unequal latitudes observed at the\r\nsame distance from the nodes, or intersections of the orbit of the\r\nplanet with the ecliptic. Into this intricacy, also, he was led by\r\nplacing too much confidence in Ptolemy's observations, which he was\r\nunable to satisfy by an unvarying obliquity. Other very important\r\nerrors, such as his belief that the line of nodes always coincided with\r\nthe line of apsides, or places of greatest and least distance from the\r\ncentral body, (whereas, at that time, in the case of Mars, for instance,\r\nthey were nearly 90° asunder,) prevented him from accurately\r\nrepresenting many of the celestial phenomena.\r\n\r\nThese brief details may serve to show that the adoption or rejection of\r\nthe theory of Copernicus was not altogether so simple a question as\r\nsometimes it may have been considered. It is, however, not a little\r\nremarkable, while it is strongly illustrative of the spirit of the\r\ntimes, that these very intricacies, with which Kepler's theories have\r\nenabled us to dispense, were the only parts of the system of Copernicus\r\nthat were at first received with approbation. His theory of Mercury,\r\nespecially, was considered a masterpiece of subtle invention. Owing to\r\nhis dread of the unfavourable judgment he anticipated on the main\r\nprinciples of his system, his work remained unpublished during forty\r\nyears, and was at last given to the world only just in time to allow\r\nCopernicus to receive the first copy of it a few hours before his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[187] By \"the opposite direction\" is meant, that while the motion in the\r\ncircumference of one circle appeared, as viewed from its centre, to be\r\nfrom left to right, the other, viewed from its centre, appeared from\r\nright to left. This must be understood whenever these or similar\r\nexpressions are repeated.\r\n\r\n[188] Venus Mercuriusque, licet ortus occasusque quotidianos ostendunt,\r\ntamen eorum circuli terras omnino non ambiunt, sed circa solem laxiore\r\nambitu circulantur.

It consists in the first instance of an extract from the\r\nwritings of the celebrated and unfortunate Peter Ramus. This\r\ndistinguished philosopher was professor of mathematics in Paris, and in\r\nthe passage in question, after calling on his contemporaries to turn\r\ntheir thoughts towards the establishment of a system of Astronomy\r\nunassisted by any hypothesis, he promised as an additional inducement to\r\nvacate his own chair in favour of any one who should succeed in this\r\nobject. Ramus perished in the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and Kepler\r\napostrophizes him as follows:—\"It is well, Ramus, that you have\r\nforfeited your pledge, by quitting your life and professorship together:\r\nfor if you still held it, I would certainly claim it as of right\r\nbelonging to me on account of this work, as I could convince you even\r\nwith your own logic.\" It was rather bold in Kepler to assert his claim\r\nto a reward held out for a theory resting on no hypothesis, by right of\r\na work filled with hypotheses of the most startling description; but of\r\nthe vast importance of this book there can be no doubt; and throughout\r\nthe many wild and eccentric ideas to which we are introduced in the\r\ncourse of it, it is fit always to bear in mind that they form part of a\r\nwork which is almost the basis of modern Astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe introduction contains a curious criticism of the commonly-received\r\ntheory of gravity, accompanied with a declaration of Kepler's own\r\nopinions on the same subject. Some of the most remarkable passages in it\r\nhave been already quoted in the life of Galileo; but, nevertheless, they\r\nare too important to Kepler's reputation to be omitted here, containing\r\nas they do a distinct and positive enunciation of the law of universal\r\ngravitation. It does not appear, however, that Kepler estimated rightly\r\nthe importance of the theory here traced out by him, since on every\r\nother occasion he advocated principles with which it is scarcely\r\nreconcileable. The discussion is introduced in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n\"The motion of heavy bodies hinders many from believing that the earth\r\nis moved by an animal motion, or rather a magnetic one. Let such\r\nconsider the following propositions. A mathematical point, whether the\r\ncentre of the universe or not, has no power, either effectively or\r\nobjectively, to move heavy bodies to approach it. Let physicians prove\r\nif they can, that such power can be possessed by a point, which, neither\r\nis a body, nor is conceived unless by relation alone. It is impossible\r\nthat the form[189] of a stone should, by moving its own body, seek a\r\nmathematical point, or in other words, the centre of the universe,\r\nwithout regard of the body in which that point exists. Let physicians\r\nprove if they can, that natural things have any sympathy with that which\r\nis nothing. Neither do heavy bodies tend to the centre of the universe\r\nby reason that they are avoiding the extremities of the round universe;\r\nfor their distance from the centre is insensible, in proportion to their\r\ndistance from the extremities of the universe. And what reason could\r\nthere be for this hatred? How strong, how wise must those heavy bodies\r\nbe, to be able to escape so carefully from an enemy lying on all sides\r\nof them: what activity in the extremities of the world to press their\r\nenemy so closely! Neither are heavy bodies driven into the centre by the\r\nwhirling of the first moveable, as happens in revolving water. For if we\r\nassume such a motion, either it would not be continued down to us, or\r\notherwise we should feel it, and be carried away with it, and the earth\r\nalso with us; nay, rather, we should be hurried away first, and the\r\nearth would follow; all which conclusions are allowed by our opponents\r\nto be absurd. It is therefore plain that the vulgar theory of gravity is\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\n\"The true theory of gravity is founded on the following axioms:—Every\r\ncorporeal substance, so far forth as it is corporeal, has a natural\r\nfitness for resting in every place where it may be situated by itself\r\nbeyond the sphere of influence of a body cognate with it. Gravity is a\r\nmutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or conjunction\r\n(similar in kind to the magnetic virtue), so that the earth attracts a\r\nstone much rather than the stone seeks the earth. Heavy bodies (if we\r\nbegin by assuming the earth to be in the centre of the world) are not\r\ncarried to the centre of the world in its quality of centre of the\r\nworld, but as to the centre of a cognate round body, namely, the earth;\r\nso that wheresoever the earth may be placed, or whithersoever it may be\r\ncarried by its animal faculty, heavy bodies will always be carried\r\ntowards it. If the earth were not round, heavy bodies would not tend\r\nfrom every side in a straight line towards the centre of the earth, but\r\nto different points from different sides. If two stones were placed in\r\nany part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of\r\ninfluence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic\r\nneedles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching\r\nthe other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other.\r\nIf the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal\r\nforce or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a\r\nfifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth\r\nthrough the other fifty-three parts and they would there meet; assuming\r\nhowever that the substance of both is of the same density. If the earth\r\nshould cease to attract its waters to itself, all the waters of the sea\r\nwould be raised and would flow to the body of the moon. The sphere of\r\nthe attractive virtue which is in the moon extends as far as the earth,\r\nand entices up the waters; but as the moon flies rapidly across the\r\nzenith, and the waters cannot follow so quickly, a flow of the ocean is\r\noccasioned in the torrid zone towards the westward. If the attractive\r\nvirtue of the moon extends as far as the earth, it follows with greater\r\nreason that the attractive virtue of the earth extends as far as the\r\nmoon, and much farther; and in short, nothing which consists of earthly\r\nsubstance any how constituted, although thrown up to any height, can\r\never escape the powerful operation of this attractive virtue. Nothing\r\nwhich consists of corporeal matter is absolutely light, but that is\r\ncomparatively lighter which is rarer, either by its own nature, or by\r\naccidental heat. And it is not to be thought that light bodies are\r\nescaping to the surface of the universe while they are carried upwards,\r\nor that they are not attracted by the earth. They are attracted, but in\r\na less degree, and so are driven outwards by the heavy bodies; which\r\nbeing done, they stop, and are kept by the earth in their own place. But\r\nalthough the attractive virtue of the earth extends upwards, as has been\r\nsaid, so very far, yet if any stone should be at a distance great enough\r\nto become sensible, compared with the earth's diameter, it is true that\r\non the motion of the earth such a stone would not follow altogether; its\r\nown force of resistance would be combined with the attractive force of\r\nthe earth, and thus it would extricate itself in some degree from the\r\nmotion of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nWho, after perusing such passages in the works of an author, whose\r\nwritings were in the hands of every student of astronomy, can believe\r\nthat Newton waited for the fall of an apple to set him thinking for the\r\nfirst time on the theory which has immortalized his name? An apple may\r\nhave fallen, and Newton may have seen it; but such speculations as those\r\nwhich it is asserted to have been the cause of originating in him had\r\nbeen long familiar to the thoughts of every one in Europe pretending to\r\nthe name of natural philosopher.\r\n\r\nAs Kepler always professed to have derived his notion of a magnetic\r\nattraction among the planetary bodies from the writings of Gilbert, it\r\nmay be worth while to insert here an extract from the \"New Philosophy\"\r\nof that author, to show in what form he presented a similar theory of\r\nthe tides, which affords the most striking illustration of that\r\nattraction. This work was not published till the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, but a knowledge of its contents may, in several\r\ninstances, be traced back to the period in which it was written:—\r\n\r\n\"There are two primary causes of the motion of the seas—the moon, and\r\nthe diurnal revolution. The moon does not act on the seas by its rays or\r\nits light. How then? Certainly by the common effort of the bodies, and\r\n(to explain it by something similar) by their magnetic attraction. It\r\nshould be known, in the first place, that the whole quantity of water is\r\nnot contained in the sea and rivers, but that the mass of earth (I mean\r\nthis globe) contains moisture and spirit much deeper even than the sea.\r\nThe moon draws this out by sympathy, so that they burst forth on the\r\narrival of the moon, in consequence of the attraction of that star; and\r\nfor the same reason, the quicksands which are in the sea open themselves\r\nmore, and perspire their moisture and spirits during the flow of the\r\ntide, and the whirlpools in the sea disgorge copious waters; and as the\r\nstar retires, they devour the same again, and attract the spirits and\r\nmoisture of the terrestrial globe. Hence the moon attracts, not so much\r\nthe sea as the subterranean spirits and humours; and the interposed\r\nearth has no more power of resistance than a table or any other dense\r\nbody has to resist the force of a magnet. The sea rises from the\r\ngreatest depths, in consequence of the ascending humours and spirits;\r\nand when it is raised up, it necessarily flows on to the shores, and\r\nfrom the shores it enters the rivers.\"[190]\r\n\r\nThis passage sets in the strongest light one of the most notorious\r\nerrors of the older philosophy, to which Kepler himself was remarkably\r\naddicted. If Gilbert had asserted, in direct terms, that the moon\r\nattracted the water, it is certain that the notion would have been\r\nstigmatized (as it was for a long time in Newton's hands) as arbitrary,\r\noccult, and unphilosophical: the idea of these subterranean humours was\r\nlikely to be treated with much more indulgence. A simple statement, that\r\nwhen the moon was over the water the latter had a tendency to rise\r\ntowards it, was thought to convey no instruction; but the assertion that\r\nthe moon draws out subterranean spirits by sympathy, carried with it a\r\nmore imposing appearance of theory. The farther removed these humours\r\nwere from common experience, the easier it became to discuss them in\r\nvague and general language; and those who called themselves philosophers\r\ncould endure to hear attributes bestowed on these fictitious elements\r\nwhich revolted their imaginations when applied to things of whose\r\nreality at least some evidence existed.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell upon the system of Tycho Brahe, which was\r\nidentical, as we have said, with one rejected by Copernicus, and\r\nconsisted in making the sun revolve about the earth, carrying with it\r\nall the other planets revolving about him. Tycho went so far as to deny\r\nthe rotation of the earth to explain the vicissitudes of day and night,\r\nbut even his favourite assistant Longomontanus differed from him in this\r\npart of his theory. The great merit of Tycho Brahe, and the service he\r\nrendered to astronomy, was entirely independent of any theory;\r\nconsisting in the vast accumulation of observations made by him during a\r\nresidence of fifteen years at Uraniburg, with the assistance of\r\ninstruments, and with a degree of care, very far superior to anything\r\nknown before his time in practical astronomy. Kepler is careful\r\nrepeatedly to remind us, that without Tycho's observations he could have\r\ndone nothing. The degree of reliance that might be placed on the results\r\nobtained by observers who acknowledged their inferiority to Tycho Brahe,\r\nmaybe gathered from an incidental remark of Kepler to Longomontanus. He\r\nhad been examining Tycho's registers, and had occasionally found a\r\ndifference amounting sometimes to 4´ in the right ascensions of the same\r\nplanet, deduced from different stars on the same night. Longomontanus\r\ncould not deny the fact, but declared that it was impossible to be\r\nalways correct within such limits. The reader should never lose sight of\r\nthis uncertainty in the observations, when endeavouring to estimate the\r\ndifficulty of finding a theory that would properly represent them.\r\n\r\nWhen Kepler first joined Tycho Brahe at Prague, he found him and\r\nLongomontanus very busily engaged in correcting the theory of Mars, and\r\naccordingly it was this planet to which he also first directed his\r\nattention. They had formed a catalogue of the mean oppositions of Mars\r\nduring twenty years, and had discovered a position of the equant, which\r\n(as they said) represented them with tolerable exactness. On the other\r\nhand, they were much embarrassed by the unexpected difficulties they met\r\nin applying a system which seemed on the one hand so accurate, to the\r\ndetermination of the latitudes, with which it could in no way be made to\r\nagree. Kepler had already suspected the cause of this imperfection, and\r\nwas confirmed in the view he took of their theory, when, on a more\r\ncareful examination, he found that they overrated the accuracy even of\r\ntheir longitudes. The errors in these, instead of amounting as they\r\nsaid, nearly to 2´, rose sometimes above 21´. In fact they had reasoned\r\nill on their own principles, and even if the foundations of their theory\r\nhad been correctly laid, could not have arrived at true results. But\r\nKepler had satisfied himself of the contrary, and the following diagram\r\nshews the nature of the first alteration he introduced, not perhaps so\r\ncelebrated as some of his later discoveries, but at least of equal\r\nconsequence to astronomy, which could never have been extricated from\r\nthe confusion into which it had fallen, till this important change had\r\nbeen effected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe practice of Tycho Brahe, indeed of all astronomers till the time of\r\nKepler, had been to fix the position of the planet's orbit and equant\r\nfrom observations on its mean oppositions, that is to say, on the times\r\nwhen it was precisely six signs or half a circle distant from the mean\r\nplace of the sun. In the annexed figure, let S represent the sun, C the\r\ncentre of the earth's orbit, T_t_. Tycho Brahe's practice amounted to\r\nthis, that if Q were supposed the place of the centre of the planet's\r\nequant, the centre of P_p_ its orbit was taken in QC, and not in QS, as\r\nKepler suggested that it ought to be taken. The consequence of this\r\nerroneous practice was, that the observations were deprived of the\r\ncharacter for which oppositions were selected, of being entirely free\r\nfrom the second inequalities. It followed therefore that as part of the\r\nsecond inequalities were made conducive towards fixing the relative\r\nposition of the orbit and equant, to which they did not naturally\r\nbelong, there was an additional perplexity in accounting for the\r\nremainder of them by the size and motion of the epicycle. As the line of\r\nnodes of every planet was also made to pass through C instead of S,\r\nthere could not fail to be corresponding errors in the latitudes. It\r\nwould only be in the rare case of an opposition of the planet in the\r\nline CS, that the time of its taking place would be the same, whether O,\r\nthe centre of the orbit, was placed in CQ or SQ. Every other opposition\r\nwould involve an error, so much the greater as it was observed at a\r\ngreater distance from the line CS.\r\n\r\nIt was long however before Tycho Brahe could be made to acquiesce in the\r\npropriety of the proposed alteration; and, in order to remove his doubts\r\nas to the possibility that a method could be erroneous which, as he\r\nstill thought, had given him such accurate longitudes, Kepler undertook\r\nthe ungrateful labour of the first part of his \"Commentaries.\" He there\r\nshewed, in the three systems of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, and Ptolemy,\r\nand in both the concentric and excentric theories, that though a false\r\nposition were given to the orbit, the longitudes of a planet might be so\r\nrepresented, by a proper position of the centre of the equant, as never\r\nto err in oppositions above 5´ from those given by observation; though\r\nthe second inequalities and the latitudes would thereby be very greatly\r\nderanged.\r\n\r\nThe change Kepler introduced, of observing apparent instead of mean\r\noppositions, made it necessary to be very accurate in his reductions of\r\nthe planet's place to the ecliptic; and in order to be able to do this,\r\na previous knowledge of the parallax of Mars became indispensable. His\r\nnext labour was therefore directed to this point; and finding that the\r\nassistants to whom Tycho Brahe had previously committed this labour had\r\nperformed it in a negligent and imperfect manner, he began afresh with\r\nTycho's original observations. Having satisfied himself as to the\r\nprobable limits of his errors in the parallax on which he finally fixed,\r\nhe proceeded to determine the inclination of the orbit and the position\r\nof the line of nodes. In all these operations his talent for\r\nastronomical inquiries appeared pre-eminent in a variety of new methods\r\nby which he combined and availed himself of the observations; but it\r\nmust be sufficient merely to mention this fact, without entering into\r\nany detail. One important result may be mentioned, at which he arrived\r\nin the course of them, the constancy of the inclination of the planet's\r\norbit, which naturally strengthened him in his new theory.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through these preliminary inquiries, he came at last to fix\r\nthe proportions of the orbit; and, in doing so, he determined, in the\r\nfirst instance, not to assume, as Ptolemy appeared to have done\r\narbitrarily, the bisection of the excentricity, but to investigate its\r\nproportion along with the other elements of the orbit, which resolution\r\ninvolved him in much more laborious calculations. After he had gone over\r\nall the steps of his theory no less than seventy times—an appalling\r\nlabour, especially if we remember that logarithms were not then\r\ninvented—his final result was, that in 1587, on the 6th of March, at 7ʰ\r\n23´, the longitude of the aphelion of Mars was 4ˢ 28° 48´ 55´´; that the\r\nplanet's mean longitude was 6ˢ 0° 51´ 35´´; that if the semidiameter of\r\nthe orbit was taken at 100000, the excentricity was 11332; and the\r\nexcentricity of the equant 18564. He fixed the radius of the greater\r\nepicycle at 14988, and that of the smaller at 3628.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to compare the longitudes as given by this, which he\r\nafterwards called the _vicarious_ theory, with the observations at\r\nopposition, the result seemed to promise him the most brilliant success.\r\nHis greatest error did not exceed 2´; but, notwithstanding these\r\nflattering anticipations, he soon found by a comparison of longitudes\r\nout of opposition and of latitudes, that it was yet far from being so\r\ncomplete as he had imagined, and to his infinite vexation he soon found\r\nthat the labour of four years, which he had expended on this theory,\r\nmust be considered almost entirely fruitless. Even his favourite\r\nprinciple of dividing the excentricity in a different ratio from\r\nPtolemy, was found to lead him into greater error than if he had\r\nretained the old bisection. By restoring that, he made his latitudes\r\nmore accurate, but produced a corresponding change for the worse in his\r\nlongitudes; and although the errors of 8´, to which they now amounted,\r\nwould probably have been disregarded by former theorists, Kepler could\r\nnot remain satisfied till they were accounted for. Accordingly he found\r\nhimself forced to the conclusion that one of the two principles on which\r\nthis theory rested must be erroneous; either the orbit of the planet is\r\nnot a perfect circle, or there is no fixed point within it round which\r\nit moves with an uniform angular motion. He had once before admitted the\r\npossibility of the former of these facts, conceiving it possible that\r\nthe motion of the planets is not at all curvilinear, but that they move\r\nin polygons round the sun, a notion to which he probably inclined in\r\nconsequence of his favourite harmonics and geometrical figures.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the failure of a theory conducted with such care in\r\nall its practical details, Kepler determined that his next trial should\r\nbe of an entirely different complexion. Instead of first satisfying the\r\nfirst inequalities of the planet, and then endeavouring to account for\r\nthe second inequalities, he resolved to reverse the process, or, in\r\nother words, to ascertain as accurately as possible what part of the\r\nplanet's apparent motion should be referred solely to the optical\r\nillusion produced by the motion of the earth, before proceeding to any\r\ninquiry of the real inequality of the planet's proper motion. It had\r\nbeen hitherto taken for granted, that the earth moved equably round the\r\ncentre of its orbit; but Kepler, on resuming the consideration of it,\r\nrecurred to an opinion he had entertained very early in his astronomical\r\ncareer (rather from his conviction of the existence of general laws,\r\nthan that he had then felt the want of such a supposition), that it\r\nrequired an equant distinct from its orbit no less than the other\r\nplanets. He now saw, that if this were admitted, the changes it would\r\neverywhere introduce in the optical part of the planet's irregularities\r\nmight perhaps relieve him from the perplexity in which the vicarious\r\ntheory had involved him. Accordingly he applied himself with renewed\r\nassiduity to the examination of this important question, and the result\r\nof his calculations (founded principally on observations of Mars'\r\nparallax) soon satisfied him not only that the earth's orbit does\r\nrequire such an equant, but that its centre is placed according to the\r\ngeneral law of the bisection of the excentricity which he had previously\r\nfound indispensable in the other planets. This was an innovation of the\r\nfirst magnitude, and accordingly Kepler did not venture to proceed\r\nfarther in his theory, till by evidence of the most varied and\r\nsatisfactory nature, he had established it beyond the possibility of\r\ncavil.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked, that this principle of the bisection of the\r\neccentricity, so familiar to the Ptolemaic astronomers, is identical\r\nwith the theory afterwards known by the name of the simple elliptic\r\nhypothesis, advocated by, Seth Ward and others. That hypothesis\r\nconsisted in supposing the sun to be placed in one focus of the elliptic\r\norbit of the planet, whose angular motion was uniform round the other\r\nfocus. In Ptolemaic phraseology, that other focus was the centre of the\r\nequant, and it is well known that the centre of the ellipse lies in the\r\nmiddle point between the two foci.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period also, that Kepler first ventured upon the new\r\nmethod of representing inequalities which terminated in one of his most\r\ncelebrated discoveries. We have already seen, in the account of the\r\n\"Mysterium Cosmographicum,\" that he was speculating, even at that time,\r\non the effects of a whirling force exerted by the sun on the planets\r\nwith diminished energy at increased distances, and on the proportion\r\nobserved between the distances of the planets from the sun, and their\r\nperiods of revolution. He seems even then to have believed in the\r\npossibility of discovering a relation between the times and distances in\r\ndifferent planets. Another analogous consequence of his theory of the\r\nradiation of the whirling force would be, that if the same planet should\r\nrecede to a greater distance from the central body, it would be acted on\r\nby a diminished energy of revolution, and consequently, a relation might\r\nbe found between the velocity at any point of its orbit, and its\r\ndistance at that point from the sun. Hence he expected to derive a more\r\ndirect and natural method of calculating the inequalities, than from the\r\nimaginary equant. But these ingenious ideas had been checked in the\r\noutset by the erroneous belief which Kepler, in common with other\r\nastronomers, then entertained of the coincidence of the earth's equant\r\nwith its orbit; in other words, by the belief that the earth's linear\r\nmotion was uniform, though it was known not to remain constantly at the\r\nsame distance from the sun. As soon as this prejudice was removed, his\r\nformer ideas recurred to him with increased force, and he set himself\r\ndiligently to consider what relation could be found between the velocity\r\nand distance of a planet from the sun. The method he adopted in the\r\nbeginning of this inquiry was to assume as approximately correct\r\nPtolemy's doctrine of the bisection of the excentricity, and to\r\ninvestigate some simple relation nearly representing the same effect.\r\n\r\nIn the annexed figure, S is the place of the sun, C the centre of the\r\nplanet's orbit AB_ab_, Q the centre of the equant represented by the\r\nequal circle DE_de_, AB, _ab_, two equal small arcs described by the\r\nplanet at the apsides of its orbit: then, according to Ptolemy's\r\nprinciples, the arc DE of the equant would be proportional to the time\r\nof passing along AB, on the same scale on which _de_ would represent the\r\ntime of passing through the equal arc _ab_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nQD:QA :: DE:AB, nearly; and because QS is bisected in C, QA, CA or QD,\r\nand SA, are in arithmetical proportion: and, therefore, since an\r\narithmetical mean, when the difference is small, does not differ much\r\nfrom a geometrical mean, QD:QA :: SA:QD, nearly. Therefore, DE:AB :: S\r\nA:QD, nearly, and in the same manner _de_:_ab_ :: S_a_:Q_d_ nearly; and\r\ntherefore DE:_de_ :: SA:S_a_ nearly. Therefore at the apsides, the\r\ntimes of passing over equal spaces, on Ptolemy's theory, are nearly as\r\nthe distances from the sun, and Kepler, with his usual hastiness,\r\nimmediately concluded that this was the accurate and general law, and\r\nthat the errors of the old theory arose solely from having departed from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt followed immediately from this assumption, that after leaving the\r\npoint A, the time in which the planet would arrive at any point P of\r\nits orbit would be proportional to, and might be represented by, the\r\nsums of all the lines that could be drawn from S to the arc AP, on the\r\nsame scale that the whole period of revolution would be denoted by the\r\nsum of all the lines drawn to every point of the orbit. Kepler's first\r\nattempt to verify this supposition approximately, was made by dividing\r\nthe whole circumference of the orbit into 360 equal parts, and\r\ncalculating the distances at every one of the points of division. Then\r\nsupposing the planet to move uniformly, and to remain at the same\r\ndistance from the sun during the time of passing each one of these\r\ndivisions, (a supposition which manifestly would not differ much from\r\nthe former one, and would coincide with it more nearly, the greater was\r\nthe number of divisions taken) he proceeded to add together these\r\ncalculated distances, and hoped to find that the time of arriving at any\r\none of the divisions bore the same ratio to the whole period, as the sum\r\nof the corresponding set of distances did to the sum of the whole 360.\r\n\r\nThis theory was erroneous; but by almost miraculous good fortune, he was\r\nled by it in the following manner to the true measure. The discovery was\r\na consequence of the tediousness of his first method, which required, in\r\norder to know the time of arriving at any point, that the circle should\r\nbe subdivided, until one of the points of division fell exactly upon the\r\ngiven place. Kepler therefore endeavoured to discover some shorter\r\nmethod of representing these sums of the distances. The idea then\r\noccurred to him of employing for that purpose the area inclosed between\r\nthe two distances, SA, SP, and the arc AP, in imitation of the manner in\r\nwhich he remembered that Archimedes had found the area of the circle, by\r\ndividing it into an infinite number of small triangles by lines drawn\r\nfrom the centre. He hoped therefore to find, that the time of passing\r\nfrom A to P bore nearly the same ratio to the whole period of revolution\r\nthat the area ASP bore to the whole circle.\r\n\r\nThis last proportion is in fact accurately observed in the revolution of\r\none body round another, in consequence of an attractive force in the\r\ncentral body. Newton afterwards proved this, grounding his demonstration\r\nupon laws of motion altogether irreconcileable with Kepler's opinions;\r\nand it is impossible not to admire Kepler's singular good fortune in\r\narriving at this correct result in spite, or rather through the means,\r\nof his erroneous principles. It is true that the labour which he\r\nbestowed unsparingly upon every one of his successive guesses, joined\r\nwith his admirable candour, generally preserved him from long retaining\r\na theory altogether at variance with observations; and if any relation\r\nsubsisted between the times and distances which could any way be\r\nexpressed by any of the geometrical quantities under consideration, he\r\ncould scarcely have failed—it might be twenty years earlier or twenty\r\nyears later,—to light upon it at last, having once put his\r\nindefatigable fancy upon this scent. But in order to prevent an\r\nover-estimate of his merit in detecting this beautiful law of nature,\r\nlet us for a moment reflect what might have been his fate had he\r\nendeavoured in the same manner, and with the same perseverance, to\r\ndiscover a relation, where, in reality, none existed. Let us take for\r\nexample the inclinations or the excentricities of the planetary orbits,\r\namong which no relation has yet been discovered; and if any exists, it\r\nis probably of too complicated a nature to be hit at a venture. If\r\nKepler had exerted his ingenuity in this direction, he might have wasted\r\nhis life in fruitless labour, and whatever reputation he might have left\r\nbehind him as an industrious calculator, it would have been very far\r\ninferior to that which has procured for him the proud title of the\r\n\"Legislator of the Heavens.\"\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the immediate consequence of thus lighting upon the\r\nreal law observed by the earth in its passage round the sun was, that he\r\nfound himself in possession of a much more accurate method of\r\nrepresenting its inequalities than had been reached by any of his\r\npredecessors; and with renewed hopes he again attacked the planet Mars,\r\nwhose path he was now able to consider undistorted by the illusions\r\narising out of the motion of the earth. Had the path of Mars been\r\naccurately circular, or even as nearly approaching a circle as that of\r\nthe earth, the method he chose of determining its position and size by\r\nmeans of three distances carefully calculated from his observed\r\nparallaxes, would have given a satisfactory result; but finding, as he\r\nsoon did, that almost every set of three distances led him to a\r\ndifferent result, he began to suspect another error in the long-received\r\nopinion, that the orbits of the planets must consist of a combination\r\nof circles; he therefore, determined, in the first instance, to fix the\r\ndistances of the planet at the apsides without any reference to the form\r\nof the intermediate orbit. Half the difference between these would, of\r\ncourse, be the excentricity of the orbit; and as this quantity came out\r\nvery nearly the same as had been determined on the vicarious theory, it\r\nseemed clear that the error of that theory, whatever it might be, did\r\nnot lie in these elements.\r\n\r\nKepler also found that in the case of this planet likewise, the times of\r\ndescribing equal arcs at the apsides were proportional to its distances\r\nfrom the sun, and he naturally expected that the method of areas would\r\nmeasure the planet's motion with as much accuracy as he had found in the\r\ncase of the earth. This hope was disappointed: when he calculated the\r\nmotion of the planet by this method, he obtained places too much\r\nadvanced when near the apsides, and too little advanced at the mean\r\ndistances. He did not, on that account, immediately reject the opinion\r\nof circular orbits, but was rather inclined to suspect the principle of\r\nmeasurement, at which he felt that he had arrived in rather a precarious\r\nmanner. He was fully sensible that his areas did not accurately\r\nrepresent the sums of any distances except those measured from the\r\ncentre of the circle; and for some time he abandoned the hope of being\r\nable to use this substitution, which he always considered merely as an\r\napproximate representation of the true measure, the sum of the\r\ndistances. But on examination he found that the errors of this\r\nsubstitution were nearly insensible, and those it did in fact produce,\r\nwere in the contrary direction of the errors he was at this time\r\ncombating. As soon as he had satisfied himself of this, he ventured once\r\nmore on the supposition, which by this time had, in his eyes, almost\r\nacquired the force of demonstration, that the orbits of the planets are\r\nnot circular, but of an oval form, retiring within the circle at the\r\nmean distances, and coinciding with it at the apsides.\r\n\r\nThis notion was not altogether new; it had been suggested in the case of\r\nMercury, by Purbach, in his \"Theories of the Planets.\" In the edition of\r\nthis work published by Reinhold, the pupil of Copernicus, we read the\r\nfollowing passage. \"Sixthly, it appears from what has been said, that\r\nthe centre of Mercury's epicycle, by reason of the motions\r\nabove-mentioned, does not, as is the case with the other planets,\r\ndescribe the circumference of a circular deferent, but rather the\r\nperiphery of a figure resembling a plane oval.\" To this is added the\r\nfollowing note by Reinhold. \"The centre of the Moon's epicycle describes\r\na path of a lenticular shape; Mercury's on the contrary is egg-shaped,\r\nthe big end lying towards his apogee, and the little end towards his\r\nperigee.\"[191] The excentricity of Mercury's orbit is, in fact, much\r\ngreater than that of any of the other planets, and the merit of making\r\nthis first step cannot reasonably be withheld from Purbach and his\r\ncommentator, although they did not pursue the inquiry so far as Kepler\r\nfound himself in a condition to do.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the consideration of the particular oval which\r\nKepler fixed upon in the first instance, it will be necessary, in order\r\nto render intelligible the source of many of his doubts and\r\ndifficulties, to make known something more of his theory of the moving\r\nforce by which he supposed the planets to be carried round in their\r\norbits. In conformity with the plan hitherto pursued, this shall be done\r\nas much as possible in his own words.\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the commonest axioms in natural philosophy, that if two\r\nthings always happen together and in the same manner, and admit the same\r\nmeasure, either the one is the cause of the other, or both are the\r\neffect of a common cause. In the present case, the increase or languor\r\nof motion invariably corresponds with an approach to or departure from\r\nthe centre of the universe. Therefore, either the languor is the cause\r\nof the departure of the star, or the departure of the languor, or both\r\nhave a common cause. But no one can be of opinion that there is a\r\nconcurrence of any third thing to be a common cause of these two\r\neffects, and in the following chapters it will be made clear that there\r\nis no occasion to imagine any such third thing, since the two are of\r\nthemselves sufficient. Now, it is not agreeable to the nature of things\r\nthat activity or languor in linear motion should be the cause of\r\ndistance from the centre. For, distance from the centre is conceived\r\nanteriorly to linear motion. In fact linear motion cannot exist without\r\ndistance from the centre, since it requires space for its\r\naccomplishment, but distance from the centre can be conceived without\r\nmotion. Therefore distance is the cause of the activity of motion, and a\r\ngreater or less distance of a greater or less delay. And since distance\r\nis of the kind of relative quantities, whose essence consists in\r\nboundaries, (for there is no efficacy in relation _per se_ without\r\nregard to bounds,) it follows that the cause of the varying activity of\r\nmotion rests in one of the boundaries. But the body of the planet\r\nneither becomes heavier by receding, nor lighter by approaching.\r\nBesides, it would perhaps be absurd on the very mention of it, that an\r\nanimal force residing in the moveable body of the planet for the purpose\r\nof moving it, should exert and relax itself so often without weariness\r\nor decay. It remains, therefore, that the cause of this activity and\r\nlanguor resides at the other boundary, that is, in the very centre of\r\nthe world, from which the distances are computed.—Let us continue our\r\ninvestigation of this moving virtue which resides in the sun, and we\r\nshall presently recognize its very close analogy to light. And although\r\nthis moving virtue cannot be identical with the light of the sun, let\r\nothers look to it whether the light is employed as a sort of instrument,\r\nor vehicle, to convey the moving virtue. There are these seeming\r\ncontradictions:—first, light is obstructed by opaque bodies, for which\r\nreason if the moving virtue travelled on the light, darkness would be\r\nfollowed by a stoppage of the moveable bodies. Again, light flows out in\r\nright lines spherically, the moving virtue in right lines also, but\r\ncylindrically; that is, it turns in one direction only, from west to\r\neast; not in the opposite direction, not towards the poles, &c. But\r\nperhaps we shall be able presently to reply to these objections. In\r\nconclusion, since there is as much virtue in a large and remote circle\r\nas in a narrow and close one, nothing of the virtue perishes in the\r\npassage from its source, nothing is scattered between the source and the\r\nmoveable. Therefore the efflux, like that of light, is not material, and\r\nis unlike that of odours, which are accompanied by a loss of substance,\r\nunlike heat from a raging furnace, unlike every other emanation by which\r\nmediums are filled. It remains, therefore, that as light which\r\nilluminates all earthly things, is the immaterial species of that fire\r\nwhich is in the body of the sun, so this virtue, embracing and moving\r\nall the planetary bodies, is the immaterial species of that virtue which\r\nresides in the sun itself, of incalculable energy, and so the primary\r\nact of all mundane motion.—I should like to know who ever said that\r\nthere was anything material in light!—Guided by our notion of the\r\nefflux of this species (or archetype), let us contemplate the more\r\nintimate nature of the source itself. For it seems as if something\r\ndivine were latent in the body of the sun, and comparable to our own\r\nsoul, whence that species emanates which drives round the planets; just\r\nas from the mind of a slinger the species of motion sticks to the\r\nstones, and carries them forward, even after he who cast them has drawn\r\nback his hand. But to those who wish to proceed soberly, reflections\r\ndiffering a little from these will be offered.\"\r\n\r\nOur readers will, perhaps, be satisfied with the assurance, that these\r\nsober considerations will not enable them to form a much more accurate\r\nnotion of Kepler's meaning than the passages already cited. We shall\r\ntherefore proceed to the various opinions he entertained on the motion\r\nof the planets.\r\n\r\nHe considered it as established by his theory, that the centre E of the\r\nplanet's epicycle (see fig. p. 33.) moved round the circumference of the\r\ndeferent D_d_, according to the law of the planet's distances; the point\r\nremaining to be settled was the motion of the planet in the epicycle. If\r\nit were made to move according to the same law, so that when the centre\r\nof the epicycle reached E, the planet should be at F, taking the angle\r\nBEF equal to BSA, it has been shewn (p. 19) that the path of F would\r\nstill be a circle, excentric from D_d_ by DA the radius of the epicycle.\r\n\r\nBut Kepler fancied that he saw many sound reasons why this could not be\r\nthe true law of motion in the epicycle, on which reasons he relied much\r\nmore firmly than on the indisputable fact, which he mentions as a\r\ncollateral proof, that it was contradicted by the observations. Some of\r\nthese reasons are subjoined: \"In the beginning of the work it has been\r\ndeclared to be most absurd, that a planet (even though we suppose it\r\nendowed with mind) should form any notion of a centre, and a distance\r\nfrom it, if there be no body in that centre to serve for a\r\ndistinguishing mark. And although you should say, that the planet has\r\nrespect to the sun, and knows beforehand, and remembers the order in\r\nwhich the distances from the sun are comprised, so as to make a perfect\r\nexcentric; in the first place, this is rather far-fetched, and requires,\r\nin any mind, means for connecting the effect of an accurately circular\r\npath with the sign of an increasing and diminishing diameter of the sun.\r\nBut there are no such means, except the position of the centre of the\r\nexcentric at a given distance from the sun; and I have already said,\r\nthat this is beyond the power of a mere mind. I do not deny that a\r\ncentre may be imagined, and a circle round it; but this I do say, if the\r\ncircle exists only in imagination, with no external sign or division,\r\nthat it is not possible that the path of a moveable body should be\r\nreally ordered round it in an exact circle. Besides, if the planet\r\nchooses from memory its just distances from the sun, so as exactly to\r\nform a circle, it must also take from the same source, as if out of the\r\nPrussian or Alphonsine tables, equal excentric arcs, to be described in\r\nunequal times, and to be described by a force extraneous from the sun;\r\nand thus would have, from its memory, a foreknowledge of what effects a\r\nvirtue, senseless and extraneous from the sun, was about to produce: all\r\nthese consequences are absurd.\r\n\r\n\"It is therefore more agreeable to reason that the planet takes no\r\nthought, either of the excentric or epicycle; but that the work which it\r\naccomplishes, or joins in effecting, is a libratory path in the diameter\r\nB_b_ of the epicycle, in the direction towards the sun. The law is now\r\nto be discovered, according to which the planet arrives at the proper\r\ndistances in any time. And indeed in this inquiry, it is easier to say\r\nwhat the law is not than what it is.\"—Here, according to his custom,\r\nKepler enumerates several laws of motion by which the planet might\r\nchoose to regulate its energies, each of which is successively\r\ncondemned. Only one of them is here mentioned, as a specimen of the\r\nrest. \"What then if we were to say this? Although the motions of the\r\nplanet are not epicyclical, perhaps the libration is so arranged that\r\nthe distances from the sun are equal to what they would have been in a\r\nreal epicyclical motion.—This leads to more incredible consequences\r\nthan the former suppositions, and yet in the dearth of better opinions,\r\nlet us for the present content ourselves with this. The greater number\r\nof absurd conclusions it will be found to involve, the more ready will a\r\nphysician be, when we come to the fifty-second chapter, to admit what\r\nthe observations testify, that the path of the planet is not circular.\"\r\n\r\nThe first oval path on which Kepler was induced to fix, by these and\r\nmany other similar considerations, was in the first instance very\r\ndifferent from the true elliptical form. Most authors would have thought\r\nit unnecessary to detain their readers with a theory which they had once\r\nentertained and rejected; but Kepler's work was written on a different\r\nplan. He thus introduces an explanation of his first oval. \"As soon as I\r\nwas thus taught by Brahe's very accurate observations that the orbit of\r\na planet is not circular, but more compressed at the sides, on the\r\ninstant I thought that I understood the natural cause of this\r\ndeflection. But the old proverb was verified in my case;—the more haste\r\nthe less speed.—For having violently laboured in the 39th chapter, in\r\nconsequence of my inability to find a sufficiently probable cause why\r\nthe orbit of the planet should be a perfect circle, (some absurdities\r\nalways remaining with respect to that virtue which resides in the body\r\nof the planet,) and having now discovered from the observations, that\r\nthe orbit is not a perfect circle, I felt furiously inclined to believe\r\nthat if the theory which had been recognized as absurd, when employed in\r\nthe 39th chapter for the purpose of fabricating a circle, were modulated\r\ninto a more probable form, it would produce an accurate orbit agreeing\r\nwith the observations. If I had entered on this course a little more\r\nwarily, I might have detected the truth immediately. But, being blinded\r\nby my eagerness, and not sufficiently regardful of every part of the\r\n39th chapter, and clinging to my first opinion, which offered itself to\r\nme with a wonderful show of probability, on account of the equable\r\nmotion in the epicycle, I got entangled in new perplexities, with which\r\nwe shall now have to struggle in this 45th chapter and the following\r\nones as far as the 50th chapter.\"\r\n\r\nIn this theory, Kepler supposed that whilst the centre of the epicycle\r\nwas moving round a circular deferent according to the law of the\r\nplanets' distances (or areas) the planet itself moved equably in the\r\nepicycle, with the mean angular velocity of its centre in the deferent.\r\nIn consequence of this supposition, since at D, when the planet is at A\r\nthe aphelion, the motion in the deferent is less than the mean motion,\r\nthe planet will have advanced through an angle BEP greater than BEF or\r\nBSA, through which the centre of the epicycle has moved; and\r\nconsequently, the path will lie everywhere within the circle A_a_,\r\nexcept at the apsides. Here was a new train of laborious calculations to\r\nundergo for the purpose of drawing the curve AP_a_ according to this\r\nlaw, and of measuring the area of any part of it. After a variety of\r\nfruitless attempts, for this curve is one of singular complexity, he was\r\nreduced, as a last resource, to suppose it insensibly different from an\r\nellipse on the same principal axes, as an approximate means of\r\nestimating its area. Not content even with the results so obtained, and\r\nnot being able to see very clearly what might be the effect of his\r\nalteration in substituting the ellipse for the oval, and in other\r\nsimplifications introduced by him, he had courage enough to obtain the\r\nsums of the 360 distances by direct calculation, as he had done in the\r\nold circular theory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his book he had spoken of his labours under the\r\nallegory of a war carried on by him against the planet; and when\r\nexulting in the early prospects of success this calculation seemed to\r\noffer, he did not omit once more to warn his readers, in his peculiar\r\nstrain, that this exultation was premature.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, gentle reader, to enjoy so splendid a triumph for one little\r\nday (I mean through the five next chapters), meantime be all rumours\r\nsuppressed of new rebellion, that our preparations may not perish,\r\nyielding us no delight. Hereafter if anything shall come to pass, we\r\nwill go through it in its own time and season; now let us be merry, as\r\nthen we will be bold and vigorous.\" At the time foretold, that is to\r\nsay, at the end of the five merry chapters, the bad news could no longer\r\nbe kept a secret. It is announced in the following bulletin:—\"While\r\nthus triumphing over Mars, and preparing for him, as for one altogether\r\nvanquished, tabular prisons, and equated eccentric fetters, it is buzzed\r\nhere and there that the victory is vain, and that the war is raging anew\r\nas violently as before. For the enemy, left at home a despised captive,\r\nhas burst all the chains of the equations, and broken forth of the\r\nprisons of the tables. For no method of geometrically administering the\r\ntheory of the 45th chapter was able to come near the accuracy of\r\napproximation of the vicarious theory of the 16th chapter, which gave me\r\ntrue equations derived from false principles. Skirmishers, disposed all\r\nround the circuit of the excentric, (I mean the true distances,) routed\r\nmy forces of physical causes levied out of the 45th chapter, and shaking\r\noff the yoke, regained their liberty. And now there was little to\r\nprevent the fugitive enemy from effecting a junction with his rebellious\r\nsupporters, and reducing me to despair, had I not suddenly sent into the\r\nfield a reserve of new physical reasonings on the rout and dispersion of\r\nthe veterans, and diligently followed, without allowing him the\r\nslightest respite, in the direction in which he had broken out.\"\r\n\r\nIn plainer terms, Kepler found, after this labour was completed, that\r\nthe errors in longitude he was still subject to were precisely of an\r\nopposite nature to those he had found with the circle; instead of being\r\ntoo quick at the apsides, the planet was now too slow there, and too\r\nmuch accelerated in the mean distances; and the distances obtained from\r\ndirect observation were everywhere greater, except at the apsides, than\r\nthose furnished by this oval theory. It was in the course of these\r\ntedious investigations that he established, still more satisfactorily\r\nthan he had before done, that the inclinations of the planets' orbits\r\nare invariable, and that the lines of their nodes pass through the\r\ncentre of the Sun, and not, as before his time had been supposed,\r\nthrough the centre of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nWhen Kepler found with certainty that this oval from which he expected\r\nso much would not satisfy the observations, his vexation was extreme,\r\nnot merely from the mortification of finding a theory confuted on which\r\nhe had spent such excessive labour, for he was accustomed to\r\ndisappointments of that kind, but principally from many anxious and\r\nfruitless speculations as to the real physical causes why the planet did\r\nnot move in the supposed epicycle, that being the point of view, as has\r\nbeen already shewn, from which he always preferred to begin his\r\ninquiries. One part of the reasoning by which he reconciled himself to\r\nthe failure exhibits much too curious a view of the state of his mind to\r\nbe passed over in silence. The argument is founded on the difficulty\r\nwhich he met with, as above mentioned, in calculating the proportions of\r\nthe oval path he had imagined. \"In order that you may see the cause of\r\nthe impracticability of this method which we have just gone through,\r\nconsider on what foundations it rests. The planet is supposed to move\r\nequably in the epicycle, and to be carried by the Sun unequably in the\r\nproportion of the distances. But by this method it is impossible to be\r\nknown how much of the oval path corresponds to any given time, although\r\nthe distance at that part is known, unless we first know the length of\r\nthe whole oval. But the length of the oval cannot be known, except from\r\nthe law of the entry of the planet within the sides of the circle. But\r\nneither can the law of this entry be known before we know how much of\r\nthe oval path corresponds to any given time. Here you see that there is\r\na _petitio principii_; and in my operations I was assuming that of which\r\nI was in search, namely, the length of the oval. This is at least not\r\nthe fault of my understanding, but it is also most alien to the primary\r\nOrdainer of the planetary courses: I have never yet found so\r\nungeometrical a contrivance in his other works. Therefore we must either\r\nhit upon some other method of reducing the theory of the 45th chapter to\r\ncalculation; or if that cannot be done, the theory itself, suspected on\r\naccount of this _petitio principii_, will totter.\" Whilst his mind was\r\nthus occupied, one of those extraordinary accidents which it has been\r\nsaid never occur but to those capable of deriving advantage from them\r\n(but which, in fact, are never noticed when they occur to any one else),\r\nfortunately put him once more upon the right path. Half the extreme\r\nbreadth between the oval and the circle nearly represented the errors of\r\nhis distances at the mean point, and he found that this half was 429\r\nparts of a radius, consisting of 100000 parts; and happening to advert\r\nto the greatest optical inequality of Mars, which amounts to about 5°\r\n18´, it struck him that 429 was precisely the excess of the secant of 5°\r\n18´ above the radius taken at 100000. This was a ray of light, and, to\r\nuse his own words, it roused him as out of sleep. In short, this single\r\nobservation was enough to produce conviction in his singularly\r\nconstituted mind, that instead of the distances SF, he should everywhere\r\nsubstitute FV, determined by drawing SV perpendicular on the line FC,\r\nsince the excess of SF above FV is manifestly that of the secant above\r\nthe radius in the optical equation SFC at that point. It is still more\r\nextraordinary that a substitution made for such a reason should have the\r\nluck, as is again the case, to be the right one. This substitution in\r\nfact amounted to supposing that the planet, instead of being at the\r\ndistance SP or SF, was at S_n_; or, in other words, that instead of\r\nrevolving in the circumference, it librated in the diameter of the\r\nepicycle, which was to him an additional recommendation. Upon this new\r\nsupposition a fresh set of distances was rapidly calculated, and to\r\nKepler's inexpressible joy, they were found to agree with the\r\nobservations within the limits of the errors to which the latter were\r\nnecessarily subject. Notwithstanding this success, he had to undergo,\r\nbefore arriving at the successful termination of his labours, one more\r\ndisappointment. Although the distance corresponding to a time from the\r\naphelion represented approximately by the area ASF, was thus found to be\r\naccurately represented by the line S_n_, there was still an error with\r\nregard to the direction in which that distance was to be measured.\r\nKepler's first idea was to set it off in the direction SF, but this he\r\nfound to lead to inaccurate longitudes; and it was not until after much\r\nperplexity, driving him, as he tells us, \"almost to insanity,\" that he\r\nsatisfied himself that the distance SQ equal to FV ought to be taken\r\nterminating in F_m_, the line from F perpendicular to A_a_, the line of\r\napsides, and that the curve so traced out by Q would be an accurate\r\nellipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe then found to his equal gratification and amazement, a small part of\r\nwhich he endeavoured to express by a triumphant figure on the side of\r\nhis diagram, that the error he had committed in taking the area ASF to\r\nrepresent the sums of the distances SF, was exactly counterbalanced; for\r\nthis area does accurately represent the sums of the distances FV or SQ.\r\nThis compensation, which seemed to Kepler the greatest confirmation of\r\nhis theory, is altogether accidental and immaterial, resulting from the\r\nrelation between the ellipse and circle. If the laws of planetary\r\nattraction had chanced to have been any other than those which cause\r\nthem to describe ellipses, this last singular confirmation of an\r\nerroneous theory could not have taken place, and Kepler would have been\r\nforced either to abandon the theory of the areas, which even then would\r\nhave continued to measure and define their motions, or to renounce the\r\nphysical opinions from which he professed to have deduced it as an\r\napproximative truth.\r\n\r\nThese are two of the three celebrated theorems called Kepler's laws: the\r\nfirst is, that the planets move in ellipses round the sun, placed in the\r\nfocus; the second, that the time of describing any arc is proportional\r\nin the same orbit to the area included between the arc and the two\r\nbounding distances from the sun. The third will be mentioned on another\r\noccasion, as it was not discovered till twelve years later. On the\r\nestablishment of these two theorems, it became important to discover a\r\nmethod of measuring such elliptic areas, but this is a problem which\r\ncannot be accurately solved. Kepler, in offering it to the attention of\r\ngeometricians, stated his belief that its solution was unattainable by\r\ndirect processes, on account of the incommensurability of the arc and\r\nsine, on which the measurement of the two parts AQ_m_, SQ_m_ depends.\r\n\"This,\" says he in conclusion, \"this is my belief, and whoever shall\r\nshew my mistake, and point out the true solution,\r\n\r\n                   _Is erit mihi magnus Apollonius._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[189] It is not very easy to carry the understanding aright among these\r\nAristotelian ideas. Many at the present day might think they understood\r\nbetter what is meant, if for \"form\" had been written \"nature.\"\r\n\r\n[190] De mundo nostro sublunari, Philosóphia Nova.

Purbachii, Parisiis, 1553.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    _Kepler appointed Professor at Linz—His second marriage—Publishes\r\n      his new Method of Gauging—Refuses a Professorship at Bologna._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN presenting this celebrated book to the emperor, Kepler gave notice\r\nthat he contemplated a farther attack upon Mars's relations, father\r\nJupiter, brother Mercury, and the rest; and promised that he would be\r\nsuccessful, provided the emperor would not forget the sinews of war, and\r\norder him to be furnished anew with means for recruiting his army. The\r\ndeath of his unhappy patron, the Emperor Rodolph, which happened in\r\n1612, barely in time to save him from the last disgrace of deposition\r\nfrom the Imperial throne, seemed to put additional difficulties in the\r\nway of Kepler's receiving the arrears so unjustly denied to him; but on\r\nthe accession of Rodolph's brother, Matthias, he was again named to his\r\npost of Imperial Mathematician, and had also a permanent professorship\r\nassigned to him in the University of Linz. He quitted Prague without\r\nmuch regret, where he had struggled against poverty during eleven years.\r\nWhatever disinclination he might feel to depart, arose from his\r\nunwillingness to loosen still more the hold he yet retained upon the\r\nwreck of Tycho Brahe's instruments and observations. Tengnagel,\r\nson-in-law of Tycho, had abandoned astronomy for a political career, and\r\nthe other members of his family, who were principally females, suffered\r\nthe costly instruments to lie neglected and forgotten, although they had\r\nobstructed with the utmost jealousy Kepler's attempts to continue their\r\nutility. The only two instruments Kepler possessed of his own property,\r\nwere \"An iron sextant of 2½ feet diameter, and a brass azimuthal\r\nquadrant, of 3½ feet diameter, both divided into minutes of a degree.\"\r\nThese were the gift of his friend and patron, Hoffman, the President of\r\nStyria, and with these he made all the observations which he added to\r\nthose of Tycho Brahe. His constitution was not favourable to these\r\nstudies, his health being always delicate, and suffering much from\r\nexposure to the night air; his eyes also were very weak, as he mentions\r\nhimself in several places. In the summary of his character which he drew\r\nup when proposing to become Tycho Brahe's assistant, he describes\r\nhimself as follows:—\"For observations my sight is dull; for mechanical\r\noperations my hand is awkward; in politics and domestic matters my\r\nnature is troublesome and choleric; my constitution will not allow me,\r\neven when in good health, to remain a long time sedentary (particularly\r\nfor an extraordinary time after dinner); I must rise often and walk\r\nabout, and in different seasons am forced to make corresponding changes\r\nin my diet.\"\r\n\r\nThe year preceding his departure to Linz was denounced by him as\r\npregnant with misfortune and misery. \"In the first place I could get no\r\nmoney from the court, and my wife, who had for a long time been\r\nsuffering under low spirits and despondency, was taken violently ill\r\ntowards the end of 1610, with the Hungarian fever, epilepsy, and\r\nphrenitis. She was scarcely convalescent when all my three children were\r\nat once attacked with small-pox. Leopold with his army occupied the town\r\nbeyond the river, just as I lost the dearest of my sons, him whose\r\nnativity you will find in my book on the new star. The town on this side\r\nof the river where I lived was harassed by the Bohemian troops, whose\r\nnew levies were insubordinate and insolent: to complete the whole, the\r\nAustrian army brought the plague with them into the city. I went into\r\nAustria, and endeavoured to procure the situation which I now hold.\r\nReturning in June, I found my wife in a decline from her grief at the\r\ndeath of her son, and on the eve of an infectious fever; and I lost her\r\nalso, within eleven days after my return. Then came fresh annoyance, of\r\ncourse, and her fortune was to be divided with my step-sisters. The\r\nEmperor Rodolph would not agree to my departure; vain hopes were given\r\nme of being paid from Saxony; my time and money were wasted together,\r\ntill on the death of the emperor, in 1612, I was named again by his\r\nsuccessor, and suffered to depart to Linz. These, methinks, were reasons\r\nenough why I should have overlooked not only your letters, but even\r\nastronomy itself.\"\r\n\r\nKepler's first marriage had not been a happy one; but the necessity in\r\nwhich he felt himself of providing some one to take charge of his two\r\nsurviving children, of whom the eldest, Susanna, was born in 1602, and\r\nLouis in 1607, determined him on entering a second time into the married\r\nstate. The account he has left us of the various negotiations which\r\npreceded his final choice, does not, in any point, belie the oddity of\r\nhis character. His friends seem to have received a general commission to\r\nlook out for a suitable match, and in a long and most amusing letter to\r\nthe Baron Strahlendorf, we are made acquainted with the pretensions and\r\nqualifications of no less than eleven ladies among whom his inclinations\r\nwavered.\r\n\r\nThe first on the list was a widow, an intimate friend of his first\r\nwife's, and who, on many accounts, appeared a most eligible match. \"At\r\nfirst she seemed favourably inclined to the proposal; it is certain that\r\nshe took time to consider it, but at last she very quietly excused\r\nherself.\" It must have been from a recollection of this lady's good\r\nqualities that Kepler was induced to make his offer; for we learn rather\r\nunexpectedly, after being informed of her decision, that when he soon\r\nafterwards paid his respects to her, it was for the first time that he\r\nhad seen her during the last six years; and he found, to his great\r\nrelief, that \"there was no single pleasing point about her.\" The truth\r\nseems to be that he was nettled by her answer, and he is at greater\r\npains than appear necessary, considering this last discovery, to\r\ndetermine why she would not accept his offered hand. Among other reasons\r\nhe suggested her children, among whom were two marriageable daughters;\r\nand it is diverting afterwards to find them also in the catalogue which\r\nKepler appeared to be making of all his female acquaintance. He seems to\r\nhave been much perplexed in attempting to reconcile his astrological\r\ntheory with the fact of his having taken so much trouble about a\r\nnegotiation not destined to succeed. \"Have the stars exercised any\r\ninfluence here? For just about this time the direction of the Mid-Heaven\r\nis in hot opposition to Mars, and the passage of Saturn, through the\r\nascending point of the zodiac, in the scheme of my nativity, will happen\r\nagain next November and December. But if these are the causes, how do\r\nthey act? Is that explanation the true one which I have elsewhere given?\r\nFor I can never think of handing over to the stars the office of deities\r\nto produce effects. Let us therefore suppose it accounted for by the\r\nstars, that at this season I am violent in my temper and affections, in\r\nrashness of belief, in a shew of pitiful tender-heartedness; in catching\r\nat reputation by new and paradoxical notions, and the singularity of my\r\nactions; in busily inquiring into, and weighing and discussing, various\r\nreasons; in the uneasiness of my mind with respect to my choice. I thank\r\nGod that that did not happen which might have happened; that this\r\nmarriage did not take place: now for the others.\" Of these others, one\r\nwas too old, another in bad health, another too proud of her birth and\r\nquarterings; a fourth had learned nothing but shewy accomplishments,\r\n\"not at all suitable to the sort of life she would have to lead with\r\nme.\" Another grew impatient, and married a more decided admirer, whilst\r\nhe was hesitating. \"The mischief (says he) in all these attachments was,\r\nthat whilst I was delaying, comparing, and balancing conflicting\r\nreasons, every day saw me inflamed with a new passion.\" By the time he\r\nreached the eighth, he found his match in this respect. \"Fortune at\r\nlength has avenged herself on my doubtful inclinations. At first she was\r\nquite complying, and her friends also: presently, whether she did or did\r\nnot consent, not only I, but she herself did not know. After the lapse\r\nof a few days, came a renewed promise, which however had to be confirmed\r\na third time; and four days after that, she again repented her\r\nconfirmation, and begged to be excused from it. Upon this I gave her up,\r\nand this time all my counsellors were of one opinion.\" This was the\r\nlongest courtship in the list, having lasted three whole months; and\r\nquite disheartened by its bad success, Kepler's next attempt was of a\r\nmore timid complexion. His advances to No. 9, were made by confiding to\r\nher the whole story of his recent disappointment, prudently determining\r\nto be guided in his behaviour, by observing whether the treatment he had\r\nexperienced met with a proper degree of sympathy. Apparently the\r\nexperiment did not succeed; and almost reduced to despair, Kepler betook\r\nhimself to the advice of a friend, who had for some time past complained\r\nthat she was not consulted in this difficult negotiation. When she\r\nproduced No. 10, and the first visit was paid, the report upon her was\r\nas follows:—\"She has, undoubtedly, a good fortune, is of good family,\r\nand of economical habits: but her physiognomy is most horribly ugly; she\r\nwould be stared at in the streets, not to mention the striking\r\ndisproportion in our figures. I am lank, lean, and spare; she is short\r\nand thick: in a family notorious for fatness she is considered\r\nsuperfluously fat.\" The only objection to No. 11 seems to have been her\r\nexcessive youth; and when this treaty was broken of on that account,\r\nKepler turned his back upon all his advisers, and chose for himself one\r\nwho had figured as No. 5 in the list, to whom he professes to have felt\r\nattached throughout, but from whom the representations of his friends\r\nhad hitherto detained him, probably on account of her humble station.\r\n\r\nThe following is Kepler's summary of her character. \"Her name is\r\nSusanna, the daughter of John Reuthinger and Barbara, citizens of the\r\ntown of Eferdingen; the father was by trade a cabinet-maker, but both\r\nher parents are dead. She has received an education well worth the\r\nlargest dowry, by favour of the Lady of Stahrenberg, the strictness of\r\nwhose household is famous throughout the province. Her person and\r\nmanners are suitable to mine; no pride, no extravagance; she can bear to\r\nwork; she has a tolerable knowledge how to manage a family; middle-aged,\r\nand of a disposition and capability to acquire what she still wants. Her\r\nI shall marry by favour of the noble baron of Stahrenberg at twelve\r\no'clock on the 30th of next October, with all Eferdingen assembled to\r\nmeet us, and we shall eat the marriage-dinner at Maurice's at the Golden\r\nLion.\"\r\n\r\nHantsch has made an absurd mistake with regard to this marriage, in\r\nstating that the bride was only twelve years old. Kästner and other\r\nbiographers have been content to repeat the same assertion without any\r\ncomment, notwithstanding its evident improbability. The origin of the\r\nblunder is to be found in Kepler's correspondence with Bernegger, to\r\nwhom, speaking of his wife, he says \"She has been educated for twelve\r\nyears by the Lady of Stahrenberg.\" This is by no means a single instance\r\nof carelessness in Hantsch; Kästner has pointed out others of greater\r\nconsequence. It was owing to this marriage, that Kepler took occasion to\r\nwrite his new method of gauging, for as he tells us in his own peculiar\r\nstyle \"last November I brought home a new wife, and as the whole course\r\nof Danube was then covered with the produce of the Austrian vineyards,\r\nto be sold at a reasonable rate, I purchased a few casks, thinking it my\r\nduty as a good husband and a father of a family, to see that my\r\nhousehold was well provided with drink.\" When the seller came to\r\nascertain the quantity, Kepler objected to his method of gauging, for\r\nhe allowed no difference, whatever might be the proportion of the\r\nbulging parts. The reflections to which this incident gave rise,\r\nterminated in the publication of the above-mentioned treatise, which\r\nclaims a place among the earliest specimens of what is now called the\r\nmodern analysis. In it he extended several properties of plane figures\r\nto segments of cones and cylinders, from the consideration that \"these\r\nsolids are incorporated circles,\" and, therefore, that those properties\r\nare true of the whole which belong to each component part. That the book\r\nmight end as oddly as it began, Kepler concluded it with a parody of\r\nCatullus:\r\n\r\n    \"Et cum pocula mille mensi erîmus\r\n    Conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus.\"\r\n\r\nHis new residence at Linz was not long undisturbed. He quarrelled there,\r\nas he had done in the early part of his life at Gratz, with the Roman\r\nCatholic party, and was excommunicated. \"Judge,\" says he to Peter\r\nHoffman, \"how far I can assist you, in a place where the priest and\r\nschool-inspector have combined to brand me with the public stigma of\r\nheresy, because in every question I take that side which seems to me to\r\nbe consonant with the word of God.\" The particular dogma which\r\noccasioned his excommunication, was connected with the doctrine of\r\ntransubstantiation. He published his creed in a copy of Latin verses,\r\npreserved by his biographer Hantsch.\r\n\r\nBefore this occurrence, Kepler had been called to the diet at Ratisbon\r\nto give his opinion on the propriety of adopting the Gregorian\r\nreformation of the calendar, and he published a short essay, pointing\r\nout the respective convenience of doing so, or of altering the old\r\nJulian Calendar in some other manner. Notwithstanding the readiness of\r\nthe diet to avail themselves of his talents for the settlement of a\r\ndifficult question, the arrears of his salary were not paid much more\r\nregularly than they had been in Rodolph's time, and he was driven to\r\nprovide himself with money by the publication of his almanac, of which\r\nnecessity he heavily and justly complained. \"In order to pay the expense\r\nof the Ephemeris for these two years, I have also written a vile\r\nprophesying almanac, which is scarcely more respectable than begging;\r\nunless it be because it saves the emperor's credit, who abandons me\r\nentirely; and with all his frequent and recent orders in council, would\r\nsuffer me to perish with hunger.\" Kepler published this Ephemeris\r\nannually till 1620; ten years later he added those belonging to the\r\nyears from 1620 to 1628.\r\n\r\nIn 1617 Kepler was invited into Italy, to succeed Magini as Professor of\r\nMathematics at Bologna. The offer tempted him; but, after mature\r\nconsideration, he rejected it, on grounds which he thus explained to\r\nRoffini:—\"By birth and spirit I am a German, imbued with German\r\nprinciples, and bound by such family ties, that even if the emperor\r\nshould consent, I could not, without the greatest difficulty, remove my\r\ndwelling-place from Germany into Italy. And although the glory of\r\nholding so distinguished a situation among the venerable professors of\r\nBologna stimulates me, and there appears great likelihood of notably\r\nincreasing my fortune, as well from the great concourse to the public\r\nlectures, as from private tuition; yet, on the other hand, that period\r\nof my life is past which was once excited by novelty, or which might\r\npromise itself a long enjoyment of these advantages. Besides, from a boy\r\nup to my present years, living a German among Germans, I am accustomed\r\nto a degree of freedom in my speech and manners, which, if persevered in\r\non my removal to Bologna, seems likely to draw upon me, if not danger,\r\nat least notoriety, and might expose me to suspicion and party malice.\r\nNotwithstanding this answer, I have yet hopes that your most honourable\r\ninvitation will be of service to me, and may make the imperial treasurer\r\nmore ready than he has hitherto been to fulfil his master's intentions\r\ntowards me. In that case I shall the sooner be able to publish the\r\nRudolphine Tables and the Ephemerides, of which you had the scheme so\r\nmany years back; and in this manner you and your advisers may have no\r\nreason to regret this invitation, though for the present it seems\r\nfruitless.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1619, the Emperor Matthias died, and was succeeded by Ferdinand III.,\r\nwho retained Kepler in the post he had filled under his two predecessors\r\non the imperial throne. Kästner, in his \"History of Mathematics,\" has\r\ncorrected a gross error of Hantsch, in asserting that Kepler\r\nprognosticated Matthias's death. The letter to which Hantsch refers, in\r\nsupport of his statement, does indeed mention the emperor's death, but\r\nmerely as a notorious event, for the purpose of recalling a date to the\r\nmemory of his correspondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    _Kepler publishes his Harmonics—Account of his Astrological\r\n      Opinions and Discovery of the Law of the Periods of the Planetary\r\n      Revolutions—Sketch of Newton's proof of Kepler's Laws._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"Cosmographical Mystery\" was written, as has been already mentioned,\r\nwhen Kepler was only twenty-six, and the wildness of its theories might\r\nbe considered as due merely to the vivacity of a young man; but as if\r\npurposely to shew that his maturer age did not renounce the creations of\r\nhis youthful fancy, he reprinted the \"Mystery\" in 1619, nearly at the\r\nsame time when he published his celebrated work on Harmonics; and the\r\nextravagance of the latter publication does not at all lose in\r\ncomparison with its predecessor. It is dedicated to James I. of England,\r\nand divided into five books: \"The first, Geometrical, on the origin and\r\ndemonstration of the laws of the figures which produce harmonious\r\nproportions;—the second, Architectonical, on figurate geometry, and the\r\ncongruence of plane and solid regular figures;—the third, properly\r\nHarmonic, on the derivation of musical proportions from figures, and on\r\nthe nature and distinction of things relating to song, in opposition to\r\nthe old theories;—the fourth, Metaphysical, Psychological, and\r\nAstrological, on the mental essence of harmonies, and of their kinds in\r\nthe world, especially on the harmony of rays emanating on the earth from\r\nthe heavenly bodies, and on their effect in nature, and on the sublunary\r\nand human soul;—the fifth, Astronomical and Metaphysical, on the very\r\nexquisite harmonies of the celestial motions, and the origin of the\r\nexcentricities in harmonious proportions.\"\r\n\r\nThe two first books are almost strictly, as Kepler styles them,\r\ngeometrical, relating in great measure to the inscription of regular\r\npolygons in a circle. The following passage is curious, presenting an\r\nanalogous idea to that contained in one of the extracts already given\r\nfrom the Commentaries on Mars. \"The heptagon, and all other polygons and\r\nstars beyond it, which have a prime number of sides, and all other\r\nfigures derived from them, cannot be inscribed geometrically in a\r\ncircle; although their sides have a necessary magnitude, it is equally a\r\nmatter of necessity that we remain ignorant of it. This is a question of\r\ngreat importance, for on this account is it that the heptagon, and other\r\nfigures of this kind, have not been employed by God in the adornment of\r\nthe world, as the other intelligible figures are employed which have\r\nbeen already explained.\" Kepler then introduces the algebraical\r\nequation, on the solution of which this problem depends, and makes a\r\nremark which is curious at this period of the history of algebra—that\r\nthe root of an equation which cannot be accurately found, may yet be\r\nfound within any degree of approximation by an expert calculator. In\r\nconclusion he again remarks that \"the side of the heptagon has no place\r\namong scientific existences, since its formal description is impossible,\r\nand therefore it cannot be known by the human mind, since the\r\npossibility of description precedes the possibility of knowledge; nor is\r\nit known even by the simple eternal act of an omniscient mind, because\r\nits nature belongs to things which cannot be known. And yet this\r\nscientific nonentity has some scientific properties, for if a heptagon\r\nwere described in a circle, the proportion of its sides would have\r\nanalogous proportions.\"\r\n\r\nThe third book is a treatise on music, in the confined and ordinary\r\nsense in which we now use that word, and apparently a sober and rational\r\none, at least as nearly so as Kepler could be trusted to write on a\r\nsubject so dangerous to his discretion. All the extravagance of the work\r\nseems reserved for the fourth book, the title of which already conveys\r\nsome notion of the nature of its contents. In this book he has collected\r\nthe substance of the astrological opinions scattered through his other\r\nworks. We shall content ourselves with merely citing his own words,\r\nwithout any attempt to explain the difference between the astrology\r\nwhich he believed, and that which he contemptuously rejected. The\r\ndistinctive line seems very finely drawn, and as both one and the other\r\nare now discarded by all who enjoy the full use of their reasoning\r\npowers, it is not of much consequence that it should be accurately\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that he does not in this treatise modify or recant\r\nanything of his earlier opinions, but refers to the favourable judgment\r\nof his contemporary philosophers as a reason for embodying them in a\r\nregular form. \"Since many very celebrated professors of philosophy and\r\nmedicine are of opinion that I have created a new and most true\r\nphilosophy, this tender plant, like all novelties, ought to be carefully\r\nnursed and cherished, so that it may strike root in the minds of\r\nphilosophers, and not be choked by the excessive humours of vain\r\nsophistications, or washed away by the torrents of vulgar prejudices, or\r\nfrozen by the chill of public neglect; and if I succeed in guarding it\r\nfrom these dangers, I have no fear that it will be crushed by the storms\r\nof calumny, or parched by the sun of sterling criticism.\"\r\n\r\nOne thing is very remarkable in Kepler's creed, that he whose candour is\r\nso indisputable in every other part of his conduct, professed to have\r\nbeen forced to adopt his astrological opinions from direct and positive\r\nobservation.—\"It is now more than twenty years since I began to\r\nmaintain opinions like these on the predominant nature of the elements,\r\nwhich, adopting the common name, I call sublunary. I have been driven to\r\nthis not by studying or admiring Plato, but singly and solely by\r\nobserving seasons, and noting the aspects by which they are produced. I\r\nhave seen the state of the atmosphere almost uniformly disturbed as\r\noften as the planets are in conjunction, or in the other configurations\r\nso celebrated among astrologers. I have noticed its tranquil state,\r\neither when there are none or few such aspects, or when they are\r\ntransitory and of short duration. I have not formed an opinion on this\r\nmatter without good grounds, like the common herd of prophesiers, who\r\ndescribe the operations of the stars as if they were a sort of deities,\r\nthe lords of heaven and earth, and producing everything at their\r\npleasure. They never trouble themselves to consider what means the stars\r\nhave of working any effects among us on the earth, whilst they remain in\r\nthe sky, and send down nothing to us which is obvious to the senses\r\nexcept rays of light. This is the principal source of the filthy\r\nastrological superstitions of that vulgar and childish race of dreamers,\r\nthe prognosticators.\"\r\n\r\nThe real manner in which the configurations of the stars operate,\r\naccording to Kepler, is as follows:—\"Like one who listens to a sweet\r\nmelodious song, and by the gladness of his countenance, by his voice,\r\nand by the beating of his hand or foot attuned to the music, gives token\r\nthat he perceives and approves the harmony: just so does sublunary\r\nnature, with the notable and evident emotion of the bowels of the earth,\r\nbear like witness to the same feelings, especially at those times when\r\nthe rays of the planets form harmonious configurations on the\r\nearth.\"—\"I have been confirmed in this theory by that which might have\r\ndeterred others; I mean, by observing that the emotions do not agree\r\nnicely with the instants of the configurations; but the earth sometimes\r\nappears lazy and obstinate, and at another time (after important and\r\nlong-continued configurations) she becomes exasperated, and gives way to\r\nher passion, even without the continuation of aspects. For in fact the\r\nearth is not an animal like a dog, ready at every nod; but more like a\r\nbull, or an elephant, slow to become angry, and so much the more furious\r\nwhen incensed.\"\r\n\r\nThis singular doctrine must not be mistaken for one of Kepler's\r\nfavourite allegories; he actually and literally professed to believe\r\nthat the earth was an enormous living animal; and he has enumerated,\r\nwith a particularity of details into which we forbear to follow him, the\r\nanalogies he recognized between its habits and those of men and other\r\nanimals. A few samples of these may speak for the rest. \"If any one who\r\nhas climbed the peaks of the highest mountains throw a stone down their\r\nvery deep clefts, a sound is heard from them; or if he throw it into one\r\nof the mountain lakes, which beyond doubt are bottomless, a storm will\r\nimmediately arise, just as when you thrust a straw into the ear or nose\r\nof a ticklish animal, it shakes its head, or runs shuddering away. What\r\nso like breathing, especially of those fish who draw water into their\r\nmouths and spout it out again through their gills, as that wonderful\r\ntide! For although it is so regulated according to the course of the\r\nmoon, that, in the preface to my 'Commentaries on Mars,' I have\r\nmentioned it as probable that the waters are attracted by the moon as\r\niron is by the loadstone; yet, if any one uphold that the earth\r\nregulates its breathing according to the motion of the sun and moon, as\r\nanimals have daily and nightly alternations of sleep and waking, I shall\r\nnot think his philosophy unworthy of being listened to; especially if\r\nany flexible parts should be discovered in the depths of the earth to\r\nsupply the functions of lungs or gills.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the next extract, we must leave the reader to learn as well as he\r\nmay, how much Kepler did, and how much he did not believe on the\r\nsubject of genethliac astrology.—\"Hence it is that human spirits, at\r\nthe time of celestial aspects, are particularly urged to complete the\r\nmatters which they have in hand. What the goad is to the ox, what the\r\nspur or the rowel is to the horse, to the soldier the bell and trumpet,\r\nan animated speech to an audience, to a crowd of rustics a performance\r\non the fife and bagpipes, that to all, and especially in the aggregate,\r\nis a heavenly configuration of suitable planets; so that every single\r\none is excited in his thoughts and actions, and all become more ready to\r\nunite and associate their efforts. For instance, in war you may see that\r\ntumults, battles, fights, invasions, assaults, attacks, and panic fears,\r\ngenerally happen at the time of the aspects of Mars and Mercury, Mars\r\nand Jupiter, Mars and the Sun, Mars and Saturn, &c. In epidemic\r\ndiseases, a greater number of persons are attacked at the times of the\r\npowerful aspects, they suffer more severely, or even die, owing to the\r\nfailure of nature in her strife with the disease, which strife (and not\r\nthe death) is occasioned by the aspect. It is not the sky which does all\r\nthese things immediately, but the faculty of the vital soul, associating\r\nits operation with the celestial harmonies, is the principal agent in\r\nthis so-called influence of the heavens. Indeed this word influence has\r\nso fascinated some philosophers that they prefer raving with the\r\nsenseless vulgar, to learning the truth with me. This essential property\r\nis the principal foundation of that admirable genethliac art. For when\r\nanything begins to have its being when that is working harmonies, the\r\nsensible harmony of the rays of the planets has peculiar influence on\r\nit. This then is the cause why those who are born under a season of many\r\naspects among the planets, generally turn out busy and industrious,\r\nwhether they accustom themselves from childhood to amass wealth, or are\r\nborn or chosen to direct public affairs, or finally, have given their\r\nattention to study. If any one think that I might be taken as an\r\ninstance of this last class, I do not grudge him the knowledge of my\r\nnativity. I am not checked by the reproach of boastfulness,\r\nnotwithstanding those who, by speech or conduct, condemn as folly all\r\nkinds of writing on this subject; the idiots, the half-learned, the\r\ninventors of titles and trappings, to throw dust in the eyes of the\r\npeople, and those whom Picus calls the plebeian theologians: among the\r\ntrue lovers of wisdom, I easily clear myself of this imputation, by the\r\nadvantage of my reader; for there is no one whose nativity or whose\r\ninternal disposition and temper I can learn so well as I know my own.\r\nWell then, Jupiter nearest the nonagesimal had passed by four degrees\r\nthe trine of Saturn; the Sun and Venus, in conjunction, were moving from\r\nthe latter towards the former, nearly in sextiles with both: they were\r\nalso removing from quadratures with Mars, to which Mercury was closely\r\napproaching: the moon drew near the trine of the same planet, close to\r\nthe Bull's Eye, even in latitude. The 25th degree of Gemini was rising,\r\nand the 22d of Aquarius culminating. That there was this triple\r\nconfiguration on that day—namely, the sextile of Saturn and the Sun,\r\nthe sextile of Mars and Jupiter, the quadrature of Mercury and Mars, is\r\nproved by the change of weather; for, after a frost of some days, that\r\nvery day became warmer, there was a thaw and a fall of rain.[192]\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish this single instance to be taken as a defence and proof\r\nof all the aphorisms of astrologers, nor do I attribute to the heavens\r\nthe government of human affairs: what a vast interval still separates\r\nthese philosophical observations from that folly or madness as it should\r\nrather be called. For, following up this example, I knew a lady[193],\r\nborn under nearly the same aspects, whose disposition, indeed, was\r\nexceedingly restless, but who not only makes no progress in literature\r\n(that is not strange in a woman), but troubles her whole family, and is\r\nthe cause to herself of deplorable misery. What, in my case, assisted\r\nthe aspects was—firstly, the fancy of my mother when pregnant with me,\r\na great admirer of her mother-in-law, my grandmother, who had some\r\nknowledge of medicine, my grandfather's profession; a second cause is,\r\nthat I was born a male, and not a female, for astrologers have sought\r\nin vain to distinguish sexes in the sky; thirdly, I derive from my\r\nmother a habit of body, more fit for study than other kinds of life;\r\nfourthly, my parents' fortune was not large, and there was no landed\r\nproperty to which I might succeed and become attached; fifthly, there\r\nwere the schools, and the liberality of the magistracy towards such boys\r\nas were apt for learning. But now if I am to speak of the result of my\r\nstudies, what I pray can I find in the sky, even remotely alluding to\r\nit. The learned confess that several not despicable branches of\r\nphilosophy have been newly extricated or amended or brought to\r\nperfection by me: but here my constellations were, not Mercury from the\r\neast, in the angle of the seventh, and in quadratures with Mars, but\r\nCopernicus, but Tycho Brahe, without whose books of observations\r\neverything now set by me in the clearest light must have remained buried\r\nin darkness; not Saturn predominating Mercury, but my Lords the Emperors\r\nRodolph and Matthias; not Capricorn, the house of Saturn, but Upper\r\nAustria, the home of the Emperor, and the ready and unexampled bounty of\r\nhis nobles to my petition. Here is that corner, not the western one of\r\nthe horoscope, but on the Earth, whither, by permission of my imperial\r\nmaster, I have betaken myself from a too uneasy court; and whence,\r\nduring these years of my life, which now tends towards its setting,\r\nemanate these Harmonies, and the other matters on which I am engaged.\r\n\r\n\"However, it may be owing to Jupiter's ascendancy that I take greater\r\ndelight in the application of geometry to physics, than in that abstract\r\npursuit which partakes of the dryness of Saturn; and it is perhaps the\r\ngibbous moon, in the bright constellation of the Bull's forehead, which\r\nfills my mind with fantastic images.\"\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable thing contained in the 5th Book, is the announcement\r\nof the celebrated law connecting the mean distances of the planets with\r\nthe periods of their revolution about the Sun. This law is expressed in\r\nmathematical language, by saying that the squares of the times vary as\r\nthe cubes of the distances.[194] Kepler's rapture on detecting it was\r\nunbounded, as may be seen from the exulting rhapsody with which he\r\nannounced it. \"What I prophecied two-and-twenty years ago, as soon as I\r\ndiscovered the five solids among the heavenly orbits—what I firmly\r\nbelieved long before I had seen Ptolemy's 'Harmonics'—what I had\r\npromised my friends in the title of this book, which I named before I\r\nwas sure of my discovery—what, sixteen years ago, I urged as a thing to\r\nbe sought—that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in\r\nPrague, for which I have devoted the best part of my life to\r\nastronomical contemplations, at length I have brought to light, and have\r\nrecognized its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations. Great as is\r\nthe absolute nature of Harmonics with all its details, as set forth in\r\nmy third book, it is all found among the celestial motions, not indeed\r\nin the manner which I imagined, (that is not the least part of my\r\ndelight,) but in another very different, and yet most perfect and\r\nexcellent. It is now eighteen months since I got the first glimpse of\r\nlight, three months since the dawn, very few days since the unveiled\r\nsun, most admirable to gaze on, burst out upon me. Nothing holds me; I\r\nwill indulge in my sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind by the\r\nhonest confession, that I have stolen the golden vases of the\r\nEgyptians[195], to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the\r\nconfines of Egypt. If you forgive me, I rejoice; if you are angry, I can\r\nbear it: the die is cast, the book is written; to be read either now or\r\nby posterity, I care not which: it may well wait a century for a reader,\r\nas God has waited six thousand years for an observer.\"\r\n\r\nHe has told, with his usual particularity, the manner and precise moment\r\nof the discovery. \"Another part of my 'Cosmographical Mystery,'\r\nsuspended twenty-two years ago, because it was then undetermined, is\r\ncompleted and introduced here, after I had discovered the true intervals\r\nof the orbits, by means of Brahe's observations, and had spent the\r\ncontinuous toil of a long time in investigating the true proportion of\r\nthe periodic times to the orbits,\r\n\r\n    Sera quidem respexit inertem,\r\n    Respexit tamen, et longo post tempore venit.\r\n\r\nIf you would know the precise moment, the first idea came across me on\r\nthe 8th March of this year, 1618; but chancing to make a mistake in the\r\ncalculation, I rejected it as false. I returned again to it with new\r\nforce on the 15th May, and it has dissipated the darkness of my mind by\r\nsuch an agreement between this idea and my seventeen years' labour on\r\nBrahe's observations, that at first I thought I must be dreaming, and\r\nhad taken my result for granted in my first assumptions. But the fact is\r\nperfect, the fact is certain, that the proportion existing between the\r\nperiodic times of any two planets is exactly the sesquiplicate\r\nproportion of the mean distances of the orbits.\"\r\n\r\nThere is high authority for not attempting over anxiously to understand\r\nthe rest of the work. Delambre sums it up as follows:—\"In the music of\r\nthe celestial bodies it appears that Saturn and Jupiter take the bass,\r\nMars the tenor, the Earth and Venus the counter-tenor, and Mercury the\r\ntreble.\" If the patience of this indefatigable historian gave way, as he\r\nconfesses, in the perusal, any further notice of it here may be well\r\nexcused. Kepler became engaged, in consequence of this publication, in\r\nan angry controversy with the eccentric Robert Fludd, who was at least\r\nKepler's match in wild extravagance and mysticism, if far inferior to\r\nhim in genius. It is diverting to hear each reproaching the other with\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Epitome of the Copernican Astronomy,\" which Kepler published\r\nabout the same time, we find the manner in which he endeavoured to\r\ndeduce the beautiful law of periodic times, from his principles of\r\nmotion and radiation of whirling forces. This work is in fact a summary\r\nof all his astronomical opinions, drawn up in a popular style in the\r\nform of question and answer. We find there a singular argument against\r\nbelieving, as some did, that each planet is carried round by an angel,\r\nfor in that case, says Kepler, \"the orbits would be perfectly circular;\r\nbut the elliptic form, which we find in them, rather smacks of the\r\nnature of the lever and material necessity.\"\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the relation between the periodic times and\r\ndistances of the planets is introduced by a query whether or not they\r\nare to be considered heavy. The answer is given in the following\r\nterms:—\"Although none of the celestial globes are heavy, in the sense\r\nin which we say on earth that a stone is heavy, nor light as fire is\r\nlight with us, yet have they, by reason of their materiality, a natural\r\ninability to move from place to place: they have a natural inertness or\r\nquietude, in consequence of which they remain still in every situation\r\nwhere they are placed alone.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ Is it then the sun, which by its turning carries round the\r\nplanets? How can the sun do this, having no hands to seize the planet at\r\nso great a distance, and force it round along with itself?—Its bodily\r\nvirtue, sent forth in straight lines into the whole space of the world,\r\nserves instead of hands; and this virtue, being a corporeal species,\r\nturns with the body of the sun like a very rapid vortex, and travels\r\nover the whole of that space which it fills as quickly as the sun\r\nrevolves in its very confined space round the centre.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ Explain what this virtue is, and belonging to what class of\r\nthings?—As there are two bodies, the mover and the moved, so are there\r\ntwo powers by which the motion is obtained. The one is passive, and\r\nrather belonging to matter, namely, the resemblance of the body of the\r\nplanet to the body of the sun in its corporeal form, and so that part of\r\nthe planetary body is friendly, the opposite part hostile to the sun.\r\nThe other power is active, and bearing more relation to form, namely,\r\nthe body of the sun has a power of attracting the planet by its friendly\r\npart, of repelling it by the hostile part, and finally, of retaining it\r\nif it be placed so that neither the one nor the other be turned directly\r\ntowards the sun.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ How can it be that the whole body of the planet should be like or\r\ncognate to the body of the sun, and yet part of the planet friendly,\r\npart hostile to the sun?—Just as when one magnet attracts another, the\r\nbodies are cognate; but attraction takes place only on one side,\r\nrepulsion on the other.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ Whence, then, arises that difference of opposite parts in the same\r\nbody?—In magnets the diversity arises from the situation of the parts\r\nwith respect to the whole. In the heavens the matter is a little\r\ndifferently arranged, for the sun does not, like the magnet, possess\r\nonly on one side, but in all the parts of its substance, this active and\r\nenergetic faculty of attracting, repelling, or retaining the planet. So\r\nthat it is probable that the centre of the solar body corresponds to one\r\nextremity or pole of the magnet, and its whole surface to the other\r\npole.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ If this were so, all the planets would be restored[196] in the\r\nsame time with the sun?—True, if this were all: but it has been said\r\nalready that, besides this carrying power of the sun, there is also in\r\nthe planets a natural inertness to motion, which causes that, by reason\r\nof their material substance, they are inclined to remain each in its\r\nplace. The carrying power of the sun, and the impotence or material\r\ninertness of the planet, are thus in opposition. Each shares the\r\nvictory; the sun moves the planet from its place, although in some\r\ndegree it escapes from the chains with which it was held by the sun, and\r\nso is taken hold of successively by every part of this circular virtue,\r\nor, as it may be called, solar circumference, namely, by the parts which\r\nfollow those from which it has just extricated itself.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ But how does one planet extricate itself more than another from\r\nthis violence—First, because the virtue emanating from the sun has the\r\nsame degree of weakness at different distances, as the distances or the\r\nwidth of the circles described on these distances.[197] This is the\r\nprincipal reason. Secondly, the cause is partly in the greater or less\r\ninertness or resistance of the planetary globes, which reduces the\r\nproportions to one-half; but of this more hereafter.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ How can it be that the virtue emanating from the sun becomes\r\nweaker at a greater distance? What is there to hurt or weaken\r\nit?—Because that virtue is corporeal, and partaking of quantity, which\r\ncan be spread out and rarefied. Then, since there is as much virtue\r\ndiffused in the vast orb of Saturn as is collected in the very narrow\r\none of Mercury, it is very rare and therefore weak in Saturn's orbit,\r\nvery dense and therefore powerful at Mercury.\r\n\r\n\"_P._ You said, in the beginning of this inquiry into motion, that the\r\nperiodic times of the planets are exactly in the sesquiplicate\r\nproportion of their orbits or circles: pray what is the cause of\r\nthis?—Four causes concur for lengthening the periodic time. First, the\r\nlength of the path; secondly, the weight or quantity of matter to be\r\ncarried; thirdly, the degree of strength of the moving virtue; fourthly,\r\nthe bulk or space into which is spread out the matter to be moved. The\r\ncircular paths of the planets are in the simple ratio of the distances;\r\nthe weights or quantities of matter in different planets are in the\r\nsubduplicate ratio of the same distances, as has been already proved; so\r\nthat with every increase of distance, a planet has more matter, and\r\ntherefore is moved more slowly, and accumulates more time in its\r\nrevolution, requiring already as it did more time by reason of the\r\nlength of the way. The third and fourth causes compensate each other in\r\na comparison of different planets: the simple and subduplicate\r\nproportion compound the sesquiplicate proportion, which therefore is the\r\nratio of the periodic times.\"\r\n\r\nThree of the four suppositions here made by Kepler to explain the\r\nbeautiful law he had detected, are now indisputably known to be false.\r\nNeither the weights nor the sizes of the different planets observe the\r\nproportions assigned by him, nor is the force by which they are retained\r\nin their orbits in any respect similar in its effects to those\r\nattributed by him to it. The wonder which might naturally be felt that\r\nhe should nevertheless reach the desired conclusion, will be\r\nconsiderably abated on examining the mode in which he arrived at and\r\nsatisfied himself of the truth of these three suppositions. It has been\r\nalready mentioned that his notions on the existence of a whirling force\r\nemanating from the sun, and decreasing in energy at increased distances,\r\nare altogether inconsistent with all the experiments and observations we\r\nare able to collect. His reason for asserting that the sizes of the\r\ndifferent planets are proportional to their distances from the sun, was\r\nsimply because he chose to take for granted that either their\r\nsolidities, surfaces, or diameters, must necessarily be in that\r\nproportion, and of the three, the solidities appeared to him least\r\nliable to objection. The last element of his precarious reasoning rested\r\nupon equally groundless assumptions. Taking as a principle, that where\r\nthere is a number of different things they must be different in every\r\nrespect, he declared that it was quite unreasonable to suppose all the\r\nplanets of the same density. He thought it indisputable that they must\r\nbe rarer as they were farther from the sun, \"and yet not in the\r\nproportion of their distances, for thus we should sin against the law of\r\nvariety in another way, and make the quantity of matter (according to\r\nwhat he had just said of their bulk) the same in all. But if we assume\r\nthe ratio of the quantities of matter to be half that of the distances,\r\nwe shall observe the best mean of all; for thus Saturn will be half as\r\nheavy again as Jupiter, and Jupiter half again as dense as Saturn. And\r\nthe strongest argument of all is, that unless we assume this proportion\r\nof the densities, the law of the periodic times will not answer.\" This\r\nis the _proof_ alluded to, and it is clear that by such reasoning any\r\nrequired result might be deduced from any given principles.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninstructive to subjoin a sketch of the manner in which\r\nNewton established the same celebrated results, starting from principles\r\nof motion diametrically opposed to Kepler's, and it need scarcely be\r\nadded, reasoning upon them in a manner not less different. For this\r\npurpose, a very few prefatory remarks will be found sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe different motions seen in nature are best analysed and classified by\r\nsupposing that every body in motion, if left to itself, will continue to\r\nmove forward at the same rate in a straight line, and by considering all\r\nthe observed deviations from this manner of moving, as exceptions and\r\ndisturbances occasioned by some external cause. To this supposed cause\r\nis generally given the name of Force, and it is said to be the first law\r\nof motion, that, unless acted on by some force, every body at rest\r\nremains at rest, and every body in motion proceeds uniformly in a\r\nstraight line. Many employ this language, without perceiving that it\r\ninvolves a definition of force, on the admission of which, it is reduced\r\nto a truism. We see common instances of force in a blow, or a pull from\r\nthe end of a string fastened to the body: we shall also have occasion\r\npresently to mention some forces where no visible connexion exists\r\nbetween the moving body and that towards which the motion takes place,\r\nand from which the force is said to proceed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _c_           C\r\n  +-------------+\r\n   \\           / \\\r\n    \\         /   \\\r\n     \\       /     \\\r\n      \\     /       \\\r\n       \\   /         \\\r\n        \\ /           \\\r\n         +-------------+\r\n         B             C' ]\r\n\r\nA second law of motion, founded upon experiment, is this: if a body have\r\nmotion communicated to it in two directions, by one of which motions\r\nalone it would have passed through a given space in a given time, as for\r\ninstance, through BC´ in one second, and by the other alone through any\r\nother space B_c_ in the same time, it will, when both are given to it at\r\nthe same instant, pass in the same time (in the present instance in one\r\nsecond) through BC the diagonal of the parallelogram of which BC´ and\r\nB_c_ are sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                  / S \\\r\n                 / /|\\ \\\r\n                / / | \\ \\\r\n               / /  |  \\ \\\r\n              / /   |   \\ \\\r\n             / /    |    \\ \\\r\n            / /     |     \\ \\\r\n   --------+-+------+------+-+\r\n           A B      C      D E ]\r\n\r\nLet a body, acted upon by no force, be moving along the line AE; that\r\nmeans, according to what has been said, let it pass over the equal\r\nstraight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, &c., in equal times. If we take any point\r\nS not in the line AE, and join AS, BS, &c., the triangles ASB, BSC, &c.\r\nare also equal, having a common altitude and standing on equal bases, so\r\nthat if a string were conceived reaching from S to the moving body\r\n(being lengthened or shortened in each position to suit its distance\r\nfrom S), this string, as the body moved along AE, would sweep over equal\r\ntriangular areas in equal times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us now examine how far these conclusions will be altered if the body\r\nfrom time to time is forced towards S. We will suppose it moving\r\nuniformly from A to B as before, no matter for the present how it got to\r\nA, or into the direction AB. If left to itself it would, in an equal\r\ntime (say 1´´) go through BC´ in the same straight line with and equal\r\nto AB. But just as it reaches B, and is beginning to move along BC´, let\r\nit be suddenly pulled towards S with a motion which, had it been at\r\nrest, would have carried it in the same time, 1´´ through any other\r\nspace B_c_. According to the second law of motion, its direction during\r\nthis 1´´, in consequence of the two motions combined, will be along BC,\r\nthe diagonal of the parallelogram of which BC´, B_c_, are sides. In\r\nthis case, as this figure is drawn, BC, though passed in the same time,\r\nis longer than AB; that is to say, the body is moving quicker than at\r\nfirst. How is it with the triangular areas, supposed as before to be\r\nswept by a string constantly stretched between S and the body? It will\r\nsoon be seen that these still remain equal, notwithstanding the change\r\nof direction, and increased swiftness. For since CC´ is parallel to\r\nB_c_, the triangles SCB, SC´B are equal, being on the same base SB, and\r\nbetween the same parallels SB, CC´, and SC´B is equal to SBA as before,\r\ntherefore SCB, SBA are equal. The body is now moving uniformly (though\r\nquicker than along AB) along BC. As before, it would in a time equal to\r\nthe time of passing along BC, go through an equal space CD´ in the same\r\nstraight line. But if at C it has a second pull towards S, strong enough\r\nto carry it to _d_ in the same time, its direction will change a second\r\ntime to CD, the diagonal of the parallelogram, whose sides are CD´,\r\nC_d_; and the circumstances being exactly similar to those at the first\r\npull, it is shewn in the same manner that the triangular area SDC = SCB\r\n= SBA.\r\n\r\nThus it appears, that in consequence of these intermitting pulls towards\r\nS, the body may be moving round, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, but\r\nthat the triangles formed by any of the straight portions of its path\r\n(which are all described in equal times), and the lines joining S to the\r\nends of that portion, are all equal. The path it will take depends of\r\ncourse, in other respects, upon the frequency and strength of the\r\ndifferent pulls, and it might happen, if they were duly proportionate,\r\nthat when at H, and moving off in the direction HA´, the pull H_a_\r\nmight be such as just to carry the body back to A, the point from which\r\nit started, and with such a motion, that after one pull more, A_b_, at\r\nA, it might move along AB as it did at first. If this were so, the body\r\nwould continue to move round in the same polygonal path, alternately\r\napproaching and receding from S, as long as the same pulls were repeated\r\nin the same order, and at the same intervals.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost unnecessary to remark, that the same equality which\r\nsubsists between any two of these triangular areas subsists also between\r\nan equal number of them, from whatever part of the path taken; so that,\r\nfor instance, the four paths AB, BC, CD, DE, corresponding to the four\r\nareas ASB, BSC, CSD, DSE, that is, to the area ABCDES, are passed in the\r\nsame time as the four EF, FG, GH, HA, corresponding to the equal area\r\nEFGHAS. Hence it may be seen, if the whole time of revolution from A\r\nround to A again be called a year, that in half a year the body will\r\nhave got to E, which in the present figure is more than half way round,\r\nand so of any other periods.\r\n\r\nThe more frequently the pulls are supposed to recur, the more frequently\r\nwill the body change its direction; and if the pull were supposed\r\nconstantly exerted in the direction towards S, the body would move in a\r\ncurve round S, for no three successive positions of it could be in a\r\nstraight line. Those who are not familiar with the methods of measuring\r\ncurvilinear spaces must here be contented to observe, that the law\r\nholds, however close the pulls are brought together, and however closely\r\nthe polygon is consequently made to resemble a curve: they may, if they\r\nplease, consider the minute portions into which the curve is so divided,\r\nas differing insensibly from little rectilinear triangles, any equal\r\nnumber of which, according to what has been said above, wherever taken\r\nin the curve, would be swept in equal times. The theorem admits, in this\r\ncase also, a rigorous proof; but it is not easy to make it entirely\r\nsatisfactory, without entering into explanations which would detain us\r\ntoo long from our principal subject.\r\n\r\nThe proportion in which the pull is strong or weak at different\r\ndistances from the central spot, is called \"_the law of the central or\r\ncentripetal force_,\" and it may be observed, that after assuming the\r\nlaws of motion, our investigations cease to have anything hypothetical\r\nor experimental in them; and that if we wish, according to these\r\nprinciples of motion, to determine the law of force necessary to make a\r\nbody move in a curve of any required form, or conversely to discover the\r\nform of the curve described, in consequence of any assumed law of force,\r\nthe inquiry is purely geometrical, depending upon the nature and\r\nproperties of geometrical quantities only. This distinction between what\r\nis hypothetical, and what necessary truth, ought never to be lost sight\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAs the object of the present treatise is not to teach geometry, we shall\r\ndescribe, in very general terms, the manner in which Newton, who was\r\nthe first who systematically extended the laws of motion to the heavenly\r\nbodies, identified their results with the two remaining laws of Kepler.\r\nHis \"Principles of Natural Philosophy\" contain general propositions with\r\nregard to any law of centripetal force, but that which he supposed to be\r\nthe true one in our system, is expressed in mathematical language, by\r\nsaying that the centripetal force varies inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance, which means, that if the force at any distance be taken for\r\nthe unit of force, at half that distance, it is two times twice, or four\r\ntimes as strong; at one-third the distance, three times thrice, or nine\r\ntimes as strong, and so for other distances. He shewed the probability\r\nof this law in the first instance by comparing the motion of the moon\r\nwith that of heavy bodies at the surface of the earth. Taking LP to\r\nrepresent part of the moon's orbit described in one minute, the line PM\r\nbetween the orbit and the tangent at L would shew the space through\r\nwhich the central force at the earth (assuming the above principles of\r\nmotion to be correct) would draw the moon. From the known distance and\r\nmotion of the moon, this line PM is found to be about sixteen feet. The\r\ndistance of the moon is about sixty times the radius of the earth, and\r\ntherefore if the law of the central force in this instance were such as\r\nhas been supposed, the force at the earth's surface would be 60 times\r\n60, or 3600 times stronger, and at the earth's surface, the central\r\nforce would make a body fall through 3600 times 16 feet in one minute.\r\nGalileo had already taught that the spaces through which a body would be\r\nmade to fall, by the constant action of the same unvarying force, would\r\nbe proportional to the squares of the times during which the force was\r\nexerted, and therefore according to these laws, a body at the earth's\r\nsurface ought (since there are sixty seconds in a minute) to fall\r\nthrough 16 feet in one second, which was precisely the space previously\r\nestablished by numerous experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith this confirmation of the supposition, Newton proceeded to the\r\npurely geometrical calculation of the law of centripetal[198] force\r\nnecessary to make a moving body describe an ellipse round its focus,\r\nwhich Kepler's observations had established to be the form of the orbits\r\nof the planets round the sun. The result of the inquiry shewed that this\r\ncurve required the same law of the force, varying inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance, which therefore of course received additional\r\nconfirmation. His method of doing this may, perhaps, be understood by\r\nreferring to the last figure but one, in which C_d_, for instance,\r\nrepresenting the space fallen from any point C towards S, in a given\r\ntime, and the area CSD being proportional to the corresponding time, the\r\nspace through which the body would have fallen at C in any other time\r\n(which would be greater, by Galileo's law, in proportion to the squares\r\nof the times), might be represented by a quantity varying directly as\r\nC_d_, and inversely in the duplicate proportion of the triangular area\r\nCSD, that is to say, proportional to C_d_/(SC × D_k_)², if D_k_ be drawn\r\nfrom D perpendicular on SC. If this polygon represent an ellipse, so\r\nthat CD represents a small arc of the curve, of which S is the focus, it\r\nis found by the nature of that curve, that C_d_/(D_k_)² is the same at\r\nall points of the curve, so that the law of variation of the force in\r\nthe same ellipse is represented solely by 1/(SC)². If C_d_, &c. are\r\ndrawn so that C_d_/(D_k_)² is not the same at every point, the curve\r\nceases to be an ellipse whose focus is at S, as Newton has shewn in the\r\nsame work. The line to which (Dk)²/Cd is found to be equal, is one drawn\r\nthrough the focus at right angles to the longest axis of the ellipse\r\ntill it meets the curve;—this line is called the _latus rectum_, and is\r\na third proportional to the two principal axes.\r\n\r\nKepler's third law follows as an immediate consequence of this\r\ndetermination; for, according to what has been already shown, the time\r\nof revolution round the whole ellipse, or, as it is commonly called,\r\nthe periodic time, bears the same ratio to the unit of time as the whole\r\narea of the ellipse does to the area described in that unit. The area of\r\nthe whole ellipse is proportional in different ellipses to the rectangle\r\ncontained by the two principal axes, and the area described in an unit\r\nof time is proportional to SC × D_k_, that is to say, is in the\r\nsubduplicate ratio of SC² × D_k_², or D_k_²/C_d_, when the force varies\r\ninversely as the square of the distance SC; and in the ellipse, as we\r\nhave said already, this is equal to a third proportional to the\r\nprincipal axes; consequently the periodic times in different ellipses,\r\nwhich are proportional to the whole areas of the ellipses directly, and\r\nthe areas described in the unit of time inversely, are in the compound\r\nratio of the rectangle of the axes directly, and subduplicately as a\r\nthird proportional to the axes inversely; that is to say, the squares of\r\nthese times are proportional to the cubes of the longest axes, which is\r\nKepler's law.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[192] This mode of verifying configurations, though something of the\r\nboldest, was by no means unusual. On a former occasion Kepler, wishing\r\nto cast the nativity of his friend Zehentmaier, and being unable to\r\nprocure more accurate information than that he was born about three\r\no'clock in the afternoon of the 21st of October, 1751, supplied the\r\ndeficiency by a record of fevers and accidents at known periods of his\r\nlife, from which he deduced a more exact horoscope.\r\n\r\n[193] Kepler probably meant his own mother, whose horoscope he in many\r\nplaces declared to be nearly the same as his own.\r\n\r\n[194] See Preliminary Treatise, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[195] In allusion to the Harmonics of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[196] This is a word borrowed from the Ptolemaic astronomy, according to\r\nwhich the sun and planets are hurried from their places by the daily\r\nmotion of the _primum mobile_, and by their own peculiar motion seek to\r\nregain or be restored to their former places.\r\n\r\n[197] In other parts of his works, Kepler assumes the diminution to be\r\nproportional to the circles themselves, not to the diameters.\r\n\r\n[198] In many curves, as in the circle and ellipse, there is a point to\r\nwhich the name of centre is given, on account of peculiar properties\r\nbelonging to it: but the term \"centripetal force\" always refers to the\r\nplace towards which the force is directed, whether or not situated in\r\nthe centre of the curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    _The Epitome prohibited at Rome—Logarithmic Tables—Trial of\r\n      Catharine Kepler—Kepler invited to England—Rudolphine\r\n      Tables—Death—Conclusion._\r\n\r\n\r\nKEPLER'S \"Epitome,\" almost immediately on its appearance, enjoyed the\r\nhonour of being placed by the side of the work of Copernicus, on the\r\nlist of books prohibited by the congregation of the Index at Rome. He\r\nwas considerably alarmed on receiving this intelligence, anticipating\r\nthat it might occasion difficulties in publishing his future writings.\r\nHis words to Remus, who had communicated the news to him, are as\r\nfollows:—\"I learn from your letter, for the first time, that my book is\r\nprohibited at Rome and Florence. I particularly beg of you, to send me\r\nthe exact words of the censure, and that you will inform me whether that\r\ncensure would be a snare for the author, if he were caught in Italy, or\r\nwhether, if taken, he would be enjoined a recantation. It is also of\r\nconsequence for me to know whether there is any chance of the same\r\ncensure being extended into Austria. For if this be so, not only shall I\r\nnever again find a printer there, but also the copies which the\r\nbookseller has left in Austria at my desire will be endangered, and the\r\nultimate loss will fall upon me. It will amount to giving me to\r\nunderstand, that I must cease to profess Astronomy, after I have grown\r\nold in the belief of these opinions, having been hitherto gainsayed by\r\nno one,—and, in short, I must give up Austria itself, if room is no\r\nlonger to be left in it for philosophical liberty.\" He was, however,\r\ntranquillized, in a great degree, by the reply of his friend, who told\r\nhim that \"the book is only prohibited as contrary to the decree\r\npronounced by the holy office two years ago. This has been partly\r\noccasioned by a Neapolitan monk (Foscarini), who was spreading these\r\nnotions by publishing them in Italian, whence were arising dangerous\r\nconsequences and opinions: and besides, Galileo was at the same time\r\npleading his cause at Rome with too much violence. Copernicus has been\r\ncorrected in the same manner for some lines, at least in the beginning\r\nof his first book. But by obtaining a permission, they may be read (and,\r\nas I suppose, this \"Epitome\" also) by the learned and skilful in this\r\nscience, both at Rome and throughout all Italy. There is therefore no\r\nground for your alarm, either in Italy or Austria; only keep yourself\r\nwithin bounds, and put a guard upon your own passions.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall not dwell upon Kepler's different works on comets, beyond\r\nmentioning that they were divided, on the plan of many of his other\r\npublications, into three parts, Astronomical, Physical, and\r\nAstrological. He maintained that comets move in straight lines, with a\r\nvarying degree of velocity. Later theories have shewn that they obey the\r\nsame laws of motion as the planets, differing from them only in the\r\nextreme excentricity of their orbits. In the second book, which contains\r\nthe Physiology of Comets, there is a passing remark that comets come out\r\nfrom the remotest parts of ether, as whales and monsters from the depth\r\nof the sea; and the suggestion is thrown out that perhaps comets are\r\nsomething of the nature of silkworms, and are wasted and consumed in\r\nspinning their own tails.\r\n\r\nAmong his other laborious employments, Kepler yet found time to\r\ncalculate tables of logarithms, he having been one of the first in\r\nGermany to appreciate the full importance of the facilities they afford\r\nto the numerical calculator. In 1618 he wrote to his friend Schickhard:\r\n\"There is a Scottish Baron (whose name has escaped my memory), who has\r\nmade a famous contrivance, by which all need of multiplication and\r\ndivision is supplied by mere addition and subtraction; and he does it\r\nwithout sines. But even he wants a table of tangents[199], and the\r\nvariety, frequency, and difficulty of the additions and subtractions, in\r\nsome cases, is greater than the labour of multiplying and dividing.\"\r\n\r\nKepler dedicated his \"Ephemeris\" for 1620 to the author of this\r\ncelebrated invention, Baron Napier, of Merchistoun; and in 1624,\r\npublished what he called \"Chilias Logarithmorum,\" containing the\r\nNapierian logarithms of the quotients of 100,000 divided by the first\r\nten numbers, then proceeding by the quotients of every ten to 100, and\r\nby hundreds to 100,000. In the supplement published the following year,\r\nis a curious notice of the manner in which this subtle contrivance was\r\nat first received: \"In the year 1621, when I had gone into Upper\r\nAustria, and had conferred everywhere with those skilled in mathematics,\r\non the subject of Napier's logarithms, I found that those whose prudence\r\nhad increased, and whose readiness had diminished, through age, were\r\nhesitating whether to adopt this new sort of numbers, instead of a table\r\nof sines; because they said it was disgraceful to a professor of\r\nmathematics to exult like a child at some compendious method of working,\r\nand meanwhile to admit a form of calculation, resting on no legitimate\r\nproof, and which at some time might entangle us in error, when we least\r\nfeared it. They complained that Napier's demonstration rested on a\r\nfiction of geometrical motion, too loose and slippery for a sound method\r\nof reasonable demonstration to be founded on it.[200] \"This led me\r\nforthwith to conceive the germ of a legitimate demonstration, which\r\nduring that same winter I attempted, without reference to lines or\r\nmotion, or flow, or any other which I may call sensible quality.\r\n\r\n\"Now to answer the question; what is the use of logarithms? Exactly what\r\nten years ago was announced by their author, Napier, and which may be\r\ntold in these words.—Wheresoever in common arithmetic, and in the Rule\r\nof Three, come two numbers to be multiplied together, there the sum of\r\nthe logarithms is to be taken; where one number is to be divided by\r\nanother, the difference; and the number corresponding to this sum or\r\ndifference, as the case may be, will be the required product or\r\nquotient. This, I say, is the use of logarithms. But in the same work in\r\nwhich I gave the demonstration of the principles, I could not satisfy\r\nthe unfledged arithmetical chickens, greedy of facilities, and gaping\r\nwith their beaks wide open, at the mention of this use, as if to bolt\r\ndown every particular gobbet, till they are crammed with my\r\nprecepticles.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1622 was marked by the catastrophe of a singular adventure\r\nwhich befell Kepler's mother, Catharine, then nearly seventy years old,\r\nand by which he had been greatly harassed and annoyed during several\r\nyears. From her youth she had been noted for a rude and passionate\r\ntemper, which on the present occasion involved her in serious\r\ndifficulties. One of her female acquaintance, whose manner of life had\r\nbeen by no means unblemished, was attacked after a miscarriage by\r\nviolent headaches, and Catharine, who had often taken occasion to sneer\r\nat her notorious reputation, was accused with having produced these\r\nconsequences, by the administration of poisonous potions. She repelled\r\nthe charge with violence, and instituted an action of scandal against\r\nthis person, but was unlucky (according to Kepler's statement) in the\r\nchoice of a young doctor, whom she employed as her advocate. Considering\r\nthe suit to be very instructive, he delayed its termination during five\r\nyears, until the judge before whom it was tried was displaced. He was\r\nsucceeded by another, already indisposed against Catharine Kepler, who\r\non some occasion had taunted him with his sudden accession to wealth\r\nfrom a very inferior situation. Her opponent, aware of this advantage,\r\nturned the tables on her, and in her turn became the accuser. The end\r\nof the matter was, that in July, 1620, Catharine was imprisoned, and\r\ncondemned to the torture. Kepler was then at Linz, but as soon as he\r\nlearned his mother's danger, hurried to the scene of trial. He found the\r\ncharges against her supported only by evidence which never could have\r\nbeen listened to, if her own intemperate conduct had not given advantage\r\nto her adversaries. He arrived in time to save her from the question,\r\nbut she was not finally acquitted and released from prison till November\r\nin the following year. Kepler then returned to Linz, leaving behind him\r\nhis mother, whose spirit seemed in no degree broken by the unexpected\r\nturn in the course of her litigation. She immediately commenced a new\r\naction for costs and damages against the same antagonist, but this was\r\nstopped by her death, in April 1622, in her seventy-fifth year.\r\n\r\nIn 1620 Kepler was visited by Sir Henry Wotton, the English ambassador\r\nat Venice, who finding him, as indeed he might have been found at every\r\nperiod of his life, oppressed by pecuniary difficulties, urged him to go\r\nover to England, where he assured him of a welcome and honourable\r\nreception; but Kepler could not resolve upon the proposed journey,\r\nalthough in his letters he often returned to the consideration of it. In\r\none of them, dated a year later, he says, \"The fires of civil war are\r\nraging in Germany—they who are opposed to the honour of the empire are\r\ngetting the upper hand—everything in my neighbourhood seems abandoned\r\nto flame and destruction. Shall I then cross the sea, whither Wotton\r\ninvites me? I, a German? a lover of firm land? who dread the confinement\r\nof an island? who presage its dangers, and must drag along with me my\r\nlittle wife and flock of children? Besides my son Louis, now thirteen\r\nyears old, I have a marriageable daughter, a two-year old son by my\r\nsecond marriage, an infant daughter, and its mother but just recovering\r\nfrom her confinement.\" Six years later, he says again,—\"As soon as the\r\nRudolphine Tables are published, my desire will be to find a place where\r\nI can lecture on them to a considerable assembly; if possible, in\r\nGermany; if not, why then in Italy, France, the Netherlands, or England,\r\nprovided the salary is adequate for a traveller.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year in which he received this invitation an affront was put\r\nupon Kepler by his early patrons, the States of Styria, who ordered all\r\nthe copies of his \"Calendar,\" for 1624, to be publicly burnt. Kepler\r\ndeclares that the reason of this was, that he had given precedence in\r\nthe title-page to the States of Upper Ens, in whose service he then was,\r\nabove Styria. As this happened during his absence in Wirtemberg, it was\r\nimmediately coupled by rumour with his hasty departure from Linz: it was\r\nsaid that he had incurred the Emperor's displeasure, and that a large\r\nsum was set upon his head. At this period Matthias had been succeeded by\r\nFerdinand III., who still continued to Kepler his barren title of\r\nimperial mathematician.\r\n\r\nIn 1624 Kepler went to Vienna, in the hopes of getting money to complete\r\nthe Rudolphine Tables, but was obliged to be satisfied with the sum of\r\n6000 florins and with recommendatory letters to the States of Suabia,\r\nfrom whom he also collected some money due to the emperor. On his return\r\nhe revisited the University of Tubingen, where he found his old\r\npreceptor, Mästlin, still alive, but almost worn out with old age.\r\nMästlin had well deserved the regard Kepler always appears to have\r\nentertained for him; he had treated him with great liberality whilst at\r\nthe University, where he refused to receive any remuneration for his\r\ninstruction. Kepler took every opportunity of shewing his gratitude;\r\neven whilst he was struggling with poverty he contrived to send his old\r\nmaster a handsome silver cup, in acknowledging the receipt of which\r\nMästlin says,—\"Your mother had taken it into her head that you owed me\r\ntwo hundred florins, and had brought fifteen florins and a chandelier\r\ntowards reducing the debt, which I advised her to send to you. I asked\r\nher to stay to dinner, which she refused: however, we handselled your\r\ncup, as you know she is of a thirsty temperament.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of the Rudolphine Tables, which Kepler always had so\r\nmuch at heart, was again delayed, notwithstanding the recent grant, by\r\nthe disturbances arising out of the two parties into which the\r\nReformation had divided the whole of Germany. Kepler's library was\r\nsealed up by desire of the Jesuits, and nothing but his connexion with\r\nthe Imperial Court secured to him his own personal indemnity. Then\r\nfollowed a popular insurrection, and the peasantry blockaded Linz, so\r\nthat it was not until 1627 that these celebrated tables finally made\r\ntheir appearance, the earliest calculated on the supposition that the\r\nplanets move in elliptic orbits. Ptolemy's tables had been succeeded by\r\nthe \"Alphonsine,\" so called from Alphonso, King of Castile, who, in the\r\nthirteenth century, was an enlightened patron of astronomy. After the\r\ndiscoveries of Copernicus, these again made way for the Prussian, or\r\nPrutenic tables, calculated by his pupils Reinhold and Rheticus. These\r\nremained in use till the observations of Tycho Brahe showed their\r\ninsufficiency, and Kepler's new theories enabled him to improve upon\r\nthem. The necessary types for these tables were cast at Kepler's own\r\nexpense. They are divided into four parts, the first and third\r\ncontaining a variety of logarithmic and other tables, for the purpose of\r\nfacilitating astronomical calculations. In the second are tables of the\r\nelements of the sun, moon, and planets. The fourth gives the places of\r\n1000 stars as determined by Tycho, and also at the end his table of\r\nrefractions, which appears to have been different for the sun, moon, and\r\nstars. Tycho Brahe assumed the horizontal refraction of the sun to be 7´\r\n30´´, of the moon 8´, and of the other stars 3´. He considered all\r\nrefraction of the atmosphere to be insensible above 45° of altitude, and\r\neven at half that altitude in the case of the fixed stars. A more\r\ndetailed account of these tables is here obviously unsuitable: it will\r\nbe sufficient to say merely, that if Kepler had done nothing in the\r\ncourse of his whole life but construct these, he would have well earned\r\nthe title of a most useful and indefatigable calculator.\r\n\r\nSome copies of these tables have prefixed to them a very remarkable map,\r\ndivided by hour lines, the object of which is thus explained:—\r\n\r\n\"The use of this nautical map is, that if at a given hour the place of\r\nthe moon is known by its edge being observed to touch any known star, or\r\nthe edges of the sun, or the shadow of the earth; and if that place\r\nshall (if necessary) be reduced from apparent to real by clearing it of\r\nparallax; and if the hour at Uraniburg be computed by the Rudolphine\r\ntables, when the moon occupied that true place, the difference will show\r\nthe observer's meridian, whether the picture of the shores be accurate\r\nor not, for by this means it may come to be corrected.\"\r\n\r\nThis is probably one of the earliest announcements of the method of\r\ndetermining longitudes by occultations; the imperfect theory of the moon\r\nlong remained a principal obstacle to its introduction in practice.\r\nAnother interesting passage connected with the same object may be\r\nintroduced here. In a letter to his friend Cruger, dated in 1616, Kepler\r\nsays: \"You propose a method of observing the distances of places by\r\nsundials and automata. It is good, but needs a very accurate practice,\r\nand confidence in those who have the care of the clocks. Let there be\r\nonly one clock, and let it be transported; and in both places let\r\nmeridian lines be drawn with which the clock may be compared when\r\nbrought. The only doubt remaining is, whether a greater error is likely\r\nfrom the unequal tension in the automaton, and from its motion, which\r\nvaries with the state of the air, or from actually measuring the\r\ndistances. For if we trust the latter, we can easily determine the\r\nlongitudes by observing the differences of the height of the pole.\"\r\n\r\nIn an Appendix to the Rudolphine Tables, or, as Kepler calls it, \"an\r\nalms doled out to the nativity casters,\" he has shown how they may use\r\nhis tables for their astrological predictions. Everything in his hands\r\nbecame an allegory; and on this occasion he says,—\"Astronomy is the\r\ndaughter of Astrology, and this modern Astrology, again, is the daughter\r\nof Astronomy, bearing something of the lineaments of her grandmother;\r\nand, as I have already said, this foolish daughter, Astrology, supports\r\nher wise but needy mother, Astronomy, from the profits of a profession\r\nnot generally considered creditable.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of these tables, the Grand Duke of Tuscany\r\nsent him a golden chain; and if we remember the high credit in which\r\nGalileo stood at this time in Florence, it does not seem too much to\r\nattribute this honourable mark of approbation to his representation of\r\nthe value of Kepler's services to astronomy. This was soon followed by a\r\nnew and final change in his fortunes. He received permission from the\r\nemperor to attach himself to the celebrated Duke of Friedland, Albert\r\nWallenstein, one of the most remarkable men in the history of that\r\ntime. Wallenstein was a firm believer in astrology, and the reception\r\nKepler experienced by him was probably due, in great measure, to his\r\nreputation in that art. However that may be, Kepler found in him a more\r\nmunificent patron than any one of his three emperors; but he was not\r\ndestined long to enjoy the appearance of better fortune. Almost the last\r\nwork which he published was a commentary on the letter addressed, by the\r\nmissionary Terrentio, from China, to the Jesuits at Ingolstadt. The\r\nobject of this communication was to obtain from Europe means for\r\ncarrying into effect a projected scheme for improving the Chinese\r\ncalendar. In this essay Kepler maintains the opinion, which has been\r\ndiscussed with so much warmth in more modern times, that the pretended\r\nancient observations of the Chinese were obtained by computing them\r\nbackwards from a much more recent date. Wallenstein furnished him with\r\nan assistant for his calculations, and with a printing press; and\r\nthrough his influence nominated him to the professorship in the\r\nUniversity of Rostoch, in the Duchy of Mecklenburg. His claims on the\r\nimperial treasury, which amounted at this time to 8000 crowns, and which\r\nFerdinand would gladly have transferred to the charge of Wallenstein,\r\nstill remained unsatisfied. Kepler made a last attempt to obtain them at\r\nRatisbon, where the imperial meeting was held, but without success. The\r\nfatigue and vexation occasioned by his fruitless journey brought on a\r\nfever, which unexpectedly put an end to his life, in the early part of\r\nNovember, 1630, in his fifty-ninth year. His old master, Mästlin,\r\nsurvived him for about a year, dying at the age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\nKepler left behind him two children by his first wife, Susanna and\r\nLouis; and three sons and two daughters, Sebald, Cordelia, Friedman,\r\nHildebert, and Anna Maria, by his widow. Susanna married, a few months\r\nbefore her father's death, a physician named Jacob Bartsch, the same who\r\nlatterly assisted Kepler in preparing his \"Ephemeris.\" He died very\r\nshortly after Kepler himself. Louis studied medicine, and died in 1663,\r\nwhilst practising as a physician at Konigsberg. The other children died\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nUpon Kepler's death the Duke of Friedland caused an inventory to be\r\ntaken of his effects, when it appeared that near 24,000 florins were due\r\nto him, chiefly on account of his salary from the emperor. His daughter\r\nSusanna, Bartsch's widow, managed to obtain a part of these arrears by\r\nrefusing to give up Tycho Brahe's observations till her claims were\r\nsatisfied. The widow and younger children were left in very straightened\r\ncircumstances, which induced Louis, Kepler's eldest son, to print, for\r\ntheir relief, one of his father's works, which had been left by him\r\nunpublished. It was not without much reluctance, in consequence of a\r\nsuperstitious feeling which he did not attempt to conceal or deny.\r\nKepler himself, and his son-in-law, Bartsch, had been employed in\r\npreparing it for publication at the time of their respective deaths; and\r\nLouis confessed that he did not approach the task without apprehension\r\nthat he was incurring some risk of a similar fate. This little rhapsody\r\nis entitled a \"Dream on Lunar Astronomy;\" and was intended to illustrate\r\nthe appearances which would present themselves to an astronomer living\r\nupon the moon.\r\n\r\nThe narrative in the dream is put into the mouth of a personage, named\r\nDuracoto, the son of an Icelandic enchantress, of the name of\r\nFiolxhildis. Kepler tells us that he chose the last name from an old map\r\nof Europe in his house, in which Iceland was called Fiolx: Duracoto\r\nseemed to him analogous to the names he found in the history of\r\nScotland, the neighbouring country. Fiolxhildis was in the habit of\r\nselling winds to mariners, and used to collect herbs to use in her\r\nincantations on the sides of Mount Hecla, on the Eve of St. John.\r\nDuracoto cut open one of his mother's bags, in punishment of which she\r\nsold him to some traders, who brought him to Denmark, where he became\r\nacquainted with Tycho Brahe. On his return to Iceland, Fiolxhildis\r\nreceived him kindly, and was delighted with the progress he had made in\r\nastronomy. She then informed him of the existence of certain spirits, or\r\ndemons, from whom, although no traveller herself, she acquired a\r\nknowledge of other countries, and especially of a very remarkable\r\ncountry, called Livania. Duracoto requesting further information, the\r\nnecessary ceremonies were performed for invoking the demon; Duracoto and\r\nhis mother enveloped their heads in their clothing, and presently \"the\r\nscreaking of a harsh dissonant voice began to speak in the Icelandic\r\ntongue.\" The island of Livania is situated in the depths of ether, at\r\nthe distance of about 250000 miles; the road thence or thither is very\r\nseldom open, and even when it is passable, mankind find the journey a\r\nmost difficult and dangerous one. The demon describes the method\r\nemployed by his fellow spirits to convey such travellers as are thought\r\nfit for the undertaking: \"We bring no sedentary people into our company,\r\nno corpulent or delicate persons; but we pick out those who waste their\r\nlife in the continual use of post-horses, or who sail frequently to the\r\nIndies; who are accustomed to live upon biscuit, garlic, dried fish, and\r\nsuch abominable feeding. Those withered old hags are exactly fit for us,\r\nof whom the story is familiar that they travel immense distances by\r\nnight on goats, and forks, and old petticoats. The Germans do not suit\r\nus at all; but we do not reject the dry Spaniards.\" This extract will\r\nprobably be sufficient to show the style of the work. The inhabitants of\r\nLivania are represented to be divided into two classes, the Privolvans\r\nand Subvolvans, by whom are meant those supposed to live in the\r\nhemisphere facing the earth, which is called the Volva, and those on the\r\nopposite half of the moon: but there is nothing very striking in the\r\naccount given of the various phenomena as respects these two classes. In\r\nsome notes which were added some time after the book was first written,\r\nare some odd insights into Kepler's method of composing. Fiolxhildis had\r\nbeen made to invoke the dæmon with twenty-one characters; Kepler\r\ndeclares, in a note, that he cannot remember why he fixed on this\r\nnumber, \"except because that is the number of letters in _Astronomia\r\nCopernicana_, or because there are twenty-one combinations of the\r\nplanets, two together, or because there are twenty-one different throws\r\nupon two dice.\" The dream is abruptly terminated by a storm, in which,\r\nsays Kepler, \"I suddenly waked; the Demon, Duracoto, and Fiolxhildis\r\nwere gone, and instead of their covered heads, I found myself rolled up\r\namong the blankets.\"\r\n\r\nBesides this trifle, Kepler left behind him a vast mass of unpublished\r\nwritings, which came at last into the hands of his biographer, Hantsch.\r\nIn 1714, Hantsch issued a prospectus for publishing them by\r\nsubscription, in twenty-two folio volumes. The plan met no\r\nencouragement, and nothing was published but a single folio volume of\r\nletters to and from Kepler, which seem to have furnished the principal\r\nmaterials for the memoir prefixed to them. After various unavailing\r\nattempts to interest different learned bodies in their appearance, the\r\nmanuscripts were purchased for the library at St. Petersburg, where\r\nEuler, Lexell, and Kraft, undertook to examine them, and select the most\r\ninteresting parts for publication. The result of this examination does\r\nnot appear.\r\n\r\nKepler's body was buried in St. Peter's churchyard at Ratisbon, and a\r\nsimple inscription was placed on his tombstone. This appears to have\r\nbeen destroyed not long after, in the course of the wars which still\r\ndesolated the country. In 1786, a proposal was made to erect a marble\r\nmonument to his memory, but nothing was done. Kästner, on whose\r\nauthority it is mentioned, says upon this, rather bitterly, that it\r\nmatters little whether or not Germany, having almost refused him bread\r\nduring his life, should, a century and a half after his death, offer him\r\na stone.\r\n\r\nDelambre mentions, in his History of Astronomy, that this design was\r\nresumed in 1803 by the Prince Bishop of Constance, and that a monument\r\nhas been erected in the Botanical Garden at Ratisbon, near the place of\r\nhis interment. It is built in the form of a temple, surmounted by a\r\nsphere; in the centre is placed a bust of Kepler, in Carrara marble.\r\nDelambre does not mention the original of the bust; but says it is not\r\nunlike the figure engraved in the frontispiece of the Rudolphine Tables.\r\nThat frontispiece consists of a portico of ten pillars, supporting a\r\ncupola covered with astronomical emblems. Copernicus, Tycho Brahe,\r\nPtolemy, Hipparchus, and other astronomers, are seen among them. In one\r\nof the compartments of the common pedestal is a plan of the observatory\r\nat Uraniburg; in another, a printing press; in a third is the figure of\r\na man, meant for Kepler, seated at a table. He is identified by the\r\ntitles of his works, which are round him; but the whole is so small as\r\nto convey very little idea of his figure or countenance. The only\r\nportrait known of Kepler was given by him to his assistant Gringallet,\r\nwho presented it to Bernegger; and it was placed by the latter in the\r\nlibrary at Strasburg. Hantsch had a copy taken for the purpose of\r\nengraving it, but died before it was completed. A portrait of Kepler is\r\nengraved in the seventh part of Boissard's Bibliotheca Chalcographica.\r\nIt is not known whence this was taken, but it may, perhaps, be a copy of\r\nthat which was engraved by desire of Bernegger in 1620. The likeness is\r\nsaid not to have been well preserved. \"His heart and genius,\" says\r\nKästner, \"are faithfully depicted in his writings; and that may console\r\nus, if we cannot entirely trust his portrait.\" In the preceding pages,\r\nit has been endeavoured to select such passages from his writings as\r\nmight throw the greatest light on his character, with a subordinate\r\nreference only to the importance of the subjects treated. In conclusion,\r\nit may be well to support the opinion which has been ventured on the\r\nreal nature of his triumphs, and on the danger of attempting to follow\r\nhis method in the pursuit of truth, by the judgment pronounced by\r\nDelambre, as well on his failures as on his success. \"Considering these\r\nmatters in another point of view, it is not impossible to convince\r\nourselves that Kepler may have been always the same. Ardent, restless,\r\nburning to distinguish himself by his discoveries, he attempted\r\neverything; and having once obtained a glimpse of one, no labour was too\r\nhard for him in following or verifying it. All his attempts had not the\r\nsame success, and, in fact, that was impossible. Those which have failed\r\nseem to us only fanciful; those which have been more fortunate appear\r\nsublime. When in search of that which really existed, he has sometimes\r\nfound it; when he devoted himself to the pursuit of a chimera, he could\r\nnot but fail; but even there he unfolded the same qualities, and that\r\nobstinate perseverance that must triumph over all difficulties but those\r\nwhich are insurmountable.\"[201]\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Kepler's published Works._\r\n\r\n  Ein Calender                               _Gratz_, 1594\r\n  Prodromus Dissertat.

This may be seen at once from a few of his\r\ndefinitions,\r\n\r\n    1 Def. A line is said to increase uniformly, when the point by which\r\n    it is described passes through equal intervals, in equal times.\r\n\r\n    2 Def. A line is said to diminish to a shorter one proportionally,\r\n    when the point passing along it cuts off in equal times segments\r\n    proportional to the remainder.\r\n\r\n    6 Def. The logarithm of any sine is the number most nearly denoting\r\n    the line, which has increased uniformly, whilst the radius has\r\n    diminished to that sine proportionally, the initial velocity being\r\n    the same in both motions. (Mirifici logarithmorum canonis\r\n    descriptio, Edinburgi 1614.)\r\n\r\nThis last definition contains what we should now call the differential\r\nequation between a number and the logarithm of its reciprocal.\r\n\r\n[201] Histoire del'Astronomie Moderne, Paris, 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes.\r\n\r\nCorrections.\r\n\r\nThe first line indicates the original, the second the correction.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of Galileo Galilei\r\n\r\np. 20:\r\n\r\n  success very inadeqnate to the zeal\r\n  success very inadequate to the zeal\r\n\r\np. 20:\r\n\r\n \"New method of Guaging,\r\n \"New method of Gauging,\r\n\r\np. 23:\r\n\r\n  the knowlege, if it existed\r\n  the knowledge, if it existed\r\n\r\np. 30, note:\r\n\r\n  to represent terrestial objects correctly.\r\n  to represent terrestrial objects correctly.\r\n\r\np. 64:\r\n\r\n  the palace of the Archishop Piccolomini\r\n  the palace of the Archbishop Piccolomini\r\n\r\np. 68:\r\n\r\n  that ladies ringlets\r\n  that ladies' ringlets\r\n\r\np. 69:\r\n\r\n  For hitherto I have never happened to see the terrestial earth\r\n  For hitherto I have never happened to see the terrestrial earth\r\n\r\np. 106:\r\n\r\n  80   1    50, _for_ any _read_ an indefinitely small.\r\n  80   2    44, _for_ any _read_ an indefinitely small.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of Kepler\r\n\r\np. 6:\r\n\r\n  Now, inscribe in the Earth an icosaedron, the circle inscribed in it\r\n  will be Venus.\r\n\r\n  Now, inscribe in the Earth an icosahedron, the circle inscribed in\r\n  it will be Venus.\r\n\r\n  Inscribe an octaedron in Venus, the circle inscribed in it will be\r\n  Mercury.\r\n\r\n  Inscribe an octahedron in Venus, the circle inscribed in it will be\r\n  Mercury.\r\n\r\np. 32:\r\n\r\n  Butthere are no such means\r\n  But there are no such means\r\n\r\np. 48:\r\n\r\n  the compound ratio of the rectangle of the axes directly, and\r\n  subduplicatly\r\n\r\n  the compound ratio of the rectangle of the axes directly, and\r\n  subduplicately\r\n\r\np. 52:\r\n\r\n  and was in-intended to illustrate the appearances\r\n  and was intended to illustrate the appearances",
