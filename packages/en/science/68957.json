Hawkins\r\n\r\n _The curious narrative that follows was found among the papers of the\r\n late Dr. John Pedric, psychical investigator and author of occult\r\n works. It bears evidences of having been received through automatic\r\n writing, as were several of his publications. Unfortunately, there\r\n are no records to confirm this assumption, and none of the mediums\r\n or assistants employed by him in his research work admits knowledge\r\n of it. Possibly--for the Doctor was reputed to possess some psychic\r\n powers--it may have been received by him. At any rate, the lack of\r\n data renders the recital useless as a document for the Society for\r\n Psychical Research. It is published for whatever intrinsic interest or\r\n significance it may possess. With reference to the names mentioned,\r\n it may be added that they are not confirmed by the records of the War\r\n Department. It could be maintained, however, that purposely fictitious\r\n names were substituted, either by the Doctor or the communicating\r\n entity._\r\n\r\n\r\nThey called me--when I walked the earth in a body of dense\r\nmatter--Richard Devaney. Though my story has little to do with the war,\r\nI was killed in the second battle of the Marne, on July 24, 1918.\r\n\r\nMany times, as men were wont to do who felt the daily, hourly imminence\r\nof death in the trenches, I had pictured that event in my mind and\r\nwondered what it would be like. Mainly I had inclined toward a belief\r\nin total extinction. That, when the vigorous, full-blooded body I\r\npossessed should lie bereft of its faculties, I, as a creature apart\r\nfrom it, should go on, was beyond credence. The play of life through\r\nthe human machine, I reasoned, was like the flow of gasoline into the\r\nmotor of an automobile. Shut off that flow, and the motor became inert,\r\ndead, while the fluid which had given it power was in itself nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd so, I confess, it was a surprise to discover that I was dead and\r\nyet not dead.\r\n\r\nI did not make the discovery at once. There had been a blinding\r\nconcussion, a moment of darkness, a sensation of falling--falling--into\r\na deep abyss. An indefinite time afterward, I found myself standing\r\ndazedly on the hillside, toward the crest of which we had been pressing\r\nagainst the enemy. The thought came that I must have momentarily lost\r\nconsciousness. Yet now I felt strangely free from physical discomfort.\r\n\r\nWhat had I been doing when that moment of blackness blotted everything\r\nout? I had been dominated by a purpose, a flaming desire----\r\n\r\nLike a flash, recollection burst upon me, and, with it, a blaze of\r\nhatred--not toward the Boche gunners, ensconced in the woods above us,\r\nbut toward the private enemy I had been about to kill.\r\n\r\nIt had been the opportunity for which I had waited interminable days\r\nand nights. In the open formation, he kept a few paces ahead of me.\r\nAs we alternately ran forward, then dropped on our bellies and fired,\r\nI had watched my chance. No one would suspect, with the dozens who\r\nwere falling every moment under the merciless fire from the trees\r\nbeyond, that the bullet which ended Louis Winston’s career came from a\r\ncomrade’s rifle.\r\n\r\nTwice I had taken aim, but withheld my fire--not from indecision, but\r\nlest, in my vengeful heat, I might fail to reach a vital spot. When I\r\nraised my rifle the third time, he offered a fair target.\r\n\r\nGod! how I hated him. With fingers itching to speed the steel toward\r\nhis heart, I forced myself to remain calm--to hold fire for that\r\nfragment of a second that would insure careful aim.\r\n\r\nThen, as the pressure of my finger tightened against the trigger, came\r\nthe blinding flash--the moment of blackness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\nI had evidently remained unconscious longer than I realized.\r\n\r\nSave for a few figures that lay motionless or squirming in agony on the\r\nfield, the regiment had passed on, to be lost in the trees at the crest\r\nof the hill. With a pang of disappointment, I realized that Louis would\r\nbe among them.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily I started onward, driven still by that impulse of burning\r\nhatred, when I heard my name called.\r\n\r\nTurning in surprise, I saw a helmeted figure crouching beside something\r\nhuddled in the tall grass. No second glance was needed to tell me that\r\nthe huddled something was the body of a soldier. I had eyes only for\r\nthe man who was bending over him. Fate had been kind to me. It was\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nApparently, in his preoccupation, he had not noticed me. Coolly I\r\nraised my rifle and fired.\r\n\r\nThe result was startling. Louis neither dropped headlong nor looked up\r\nat the report. Vaguely I questioned whether there had been a report.\r\n\r\nThwarted, I felt the lust to kill mounting in me with redoubled fury.\r\nWith rifle upraised, I ran toward him. A terrific swing, and I crashed\r\nthe stock against his head.\r\n\r\nIt passed clear through! Louis remained unmoved.\r\n\r\nUncomprehending, snarling, I flung the useless weapon away and fell\r\nupon him with bare hands--with fingers that strained to rend and tear\r\nand strangle.\r\n\r\nInstead of encountering solid flesh and bone, they too passed through\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWas it a mirage? A dream? Had I gone crazy? Sobered--for a moment\r\nforgetful of my fury--I drew back and tried to reduce the thing to\r\nreason. Was Louis but a figment of the imagination--a phantom?\r\n\r\nMy glance fell upon the figure beside which he was sobbing incoherent\r\nwords of entreaty.\r\n\r\nI gave a start, then looked more closely.\r\n\r\nThe dead man--for there was no question about his condition, with a\r\nbloody shrapnel wound in the side of his head--_was myself_!\r\n\r\nGradually the import of this penetrated my consciousness. Then I\r\nrealized that it was Louis who had called my name--that even now he was\r\nsobbing it over and over.\r\n\r\nThe irony of it struck me at the moment of realization. I was dead--_I_\r\nwas the phantom--who had meant to kill Louis!\r\n\r\nI looked at my hands, my uniform--I touched my body. Apparently I was\r\nas substantial as before the shrapnel buried itself in my head. Yet,\r\nwhen I had tried to grasp Louis, my hand seemed to encompass only space.\r\n\r\n_Louis lived, and I was dead!_\r\n\r\nThe discovery for a time benumbed my feeling toward him. With\r\nimpersonal curiosity, I saw him close the eyes of the dead man--the man\r\nwho, somehow or other, had been me. I saw him search the pockets and\r\ndraw forth a letter I had written only that morning, a letter addressed\r\nto----\r\n\r\nWith a sudden surge of dismay, I darted forward to snatch it from his\r\nhands. He should not read that letter!\r\n\r\nAgain I was reminded of my impalpability.\r\n\r\nBut Louis did not open the envelope, although it was unsealed. He read\r\nthe superscription, kissed it, as sobs rent his frame, and thrust the\r\nletter inside his khaki jacket.\r\n\r\n“Dick! Buddie!” he cried brokenly. “Best pal man ever had--how can I\r\ntake this news back to her!”\r\n\r\nMy lips curled. To Louis, I was his pal, his buddie. Not a suspicion\r\nof the hate I bore him--had borne him ever since I discovered in him a\r\nrival for Velma Roth.\r\n\r\nOh, I had been clever! It was our “unselfish friendship” that endeared\r\nus both to her. A sign of jealousy, of ill nature, and I would have\r\nforfeited the paradise of her regard that apparently I shared with\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nI had never felt secure of my place in that paradise. True, I could\r\nalways awaken a response in her, but I must put forth effort in order\r\nto do so. He held her interest, it seemed, without trying. They were\r\nhappy with each other and in each other.\r\n\r\nOur relations might be expressed by likening her to the water of a\r\nplacid pool, Louis to the basin that held her, me to the wind that\r\nswept over it. By exerting myself, I could agitate the surface of her\r\nnature into ripples of pleasurable excitement--could even lash her\r\nemotion into a tempest. She responded to the stimulation of my mood,\r\nyet, in my absence, settled contentedly into the peaceful comfort of\r\nLouis’ steadfast love.\r\n\r\nI felt vaguely then--and am certain now, with a broader perspective\r\ntoward realities--that Velma intuitively recognized Louis as her\r\nmate, yet feared to yield herself to him because of my sway over her\r\nemotional nature.\r\n\r\nWhen the great war came, we all, I am convinced, felt that it would\r\nabsolve Velma from the task of choosing between us.\r\n\r\nWhether the agony that spoke from the violet depths of her eyes when we\r\nsaid good-by was chiefly for Louis or for me, I could not tell. I doubt\r\nif she could have done so. But in my mind was the determination that\r\nonly one of us should return, and--Louis would not be that one.\r\n\r\nDid I feel no repugnance at thought of murdering the man who stood in\r\nmy way? Very little. I was a savage at heart--a savage in whom desire\r\noutweighed anything that might stand in the way of gaining its object.\r\nFrom my point of view, I would have been a fool to pass the opportunity.\r\n\r\nWhy I should have so hated him--a mere obstacle in my path--I do not\r\nknow. It may have been due to a prescience of the intangible barrier\r\nhis blood would always raise between Velma and me--or to a slumbering\r\nsense of remorse.\r\n\r\nBut, speculation aside, here I was, in a state of being that the world\r\ncalls death, while Louis lived--was free to return home--to claim\r\nVelma--to flaunt his possession of all that I held precious.\r\n\r\nIt was maddening! Must I stand idly by, helpless to prevent this?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _III._\r\n\r\nI have wondered, since, how I could remain so long in touch with the\r\nobjective world--why I did not at once, or very soon, find myself shut\r\noff from earthly sights and sounds as those in physical form are shut\r\noff from the things beyond.\r\n\r\nThe matter seems to have been determined by my will. Like weights of\r\nlead, envy of Louis and passionate longing for Velma held my feet to\r\nthe sphere of dense matter.\r\n\r\nVengeful, despairing, I watched beside Louis. When at last he turned\r\naway from my body and, with tears streaming from his eyes, began to\r\ndrag a useless leg toward the trenches we had left, I realized why he\r\nhad not gone on with the others to the crest of the hill. He, too, was\r\na victim of Boche gunnery.\r\n\r\nI walked beside the stretcher-bearers when they had picked him up and\r\nwere conveying him toward the base hospital. Throughout the weeks that\r\nfollowed I hovered near his cot, watching the doctors as they bound up\r\nthe lacerated tendons in his thigh, and missing no detail of his battle\r\nwith the fever.\r\n\r\nOver his shoulder I read the first letter he wrote home to Velma, in\r\nwhich he gave a belated account of my death, dwelling upon the glory of\r\nmy sacrifice.\r\n\r\n “_I have often thought that you two were meant for each other_” [he\r\n wrote] “_and that if it had not been for fear of hurting me, you would\r\n have been his wife long ago. He was the best buddie a man ever had. If\r\n only I could have been the one to die!_”\r\n\r\nHad I known it, I could have followed this letter across seas--could,\r\nin fact, have passed it and, by an exercise of the will, have been\r\nat Velma’s side in the twinkling of an eye. But my ignorance of the\r\nlaws of the new plane was total. All my thoughts were centered upon a\r\nproblem of entirely different character.\r\n\r\nNever was hold upon earthly treasure more reluctantly relinquished\r\nthan was my hope of possessing Velma. Surely, death could not\r\nerect so absolute a barrier. There must be a way--some loophole of\r\ncommunication--some chance for a disembodied man to contend with his\r\ncorporeal rival for a woman’s love.\r\n\r\nSlowly, very slowly, dawned the light of a plan. So feeble was the\r\nglimmer that it would scarcely have comforted one in less desperate\r\nstraits, but to me it appeared to offer a possible hope. I set about\r\nmethodically, with infinite patience, evolving it into something\r\ntangible, even though I had but the most indefinite idea of what the\r\noutcome might be.\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion came when Louis had so far recovered that but\r\nlittle trace of the fever remained. One afternoon, as he lay sleeping,\r\nthe mail-distributor handed a letter to the nurse who happened to be\r\nstanding beside his cot. She glanced at it, then tucked it under his\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nThe letter was from Velma, and I was hungry for the contents. I did not\r\nthen know that I could have read it easily, sealed though it was. In a\r\nfrenzy of impatience, I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Wake up, confound it, and read your letter!”\r\n\r\nWith a start, he opened his eyes. He looked around with a bewildered\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n“Under your pillow!” I fumed. “Look under your pillow!”\r\n\r\nIn a dazed manner, he put his hand under the pillow and drew forth the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, I heard him commenting on the experience to the\r\nnurse.\r\n\r\n“Something seemed to wake me up,” he said, “and I had a peculiar\r\nimpulse to feel under the pillow. It was just as if I knew I would find\r\nthe letter there.”\r\n\r\nThe circumstances seemed as remarkable to me as it did to him. It might\r\nbe coincidence, but I determined to make a further test.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments convinced me that I could, to a very slight\r\ndegree, impress my thoughts and will upon Louis, especially when he\r\nwas tired or on the borderland of sleep. Occasionally I was able to\r\ncontrol the direction of his thoughts as he wrote home to Velma.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, he was describing for her a funny little French woman\r\nwho visited the hospital with a basket that always was filled with\r\ncigarettes and candy.\r\n\r\n“_Last time_” [he wrote], “_she brought with her a boy whom she\r\ncalled...._”\r\n\r\nHe paused, with pencil upraised, trying to recall the name.\r\n\r\nA moment later, he looked down at the page and stared with\r\nastonishment. The words, “_She called him Maurice_,” had been added\r\nbelow the unfinished line.\r\n\r\n“I must be going daffy,” he muttered. “I’d swear I didn’t write that.”\r\n\r\nBehind him, I stood rubbing my hands in triumph. It was my first\r\nsuccessful effort to guide the pencil while his thoughts strayed\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnother time, he wrote to Velma:\r\n\r\n “_I’ve a strange feeling, lately, that dear old Dick is near.\r\n Sometimes, as I wake up, I seem to remember vaguely having seen him in\r\n my dreams. It’s as if his features were just fading from view._”\r\n\r\nHe paused here so long that I made another attempt to take advantage of\r\nhis abstraction.\r\n\r\nBy an effort of the will that it is difficult to explain, I guided his\r\nhand into the formation of the words:\r\n\r\n “_With a jugful of kisses for Winkie, as ever her...._”\r\n\r\nJust then, Louis looked down.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” he exclaimed, as if he had seen a ghost.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IV._\r\n\r\n“Winkie” was a pet name I had given Velma when we were children\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nLouis always maintained there was no sense in it, and refused to adopt\r\nit, though I frequently called her by the name in later years. And\r\nof his own volition, Louis would never have mentioned anything so\r\nconvivial as a jugful of kisses.\r\n\r\nSo, through the weary months before he was invalided home, I worked.\r\nWhen he left France at the debarkation point, he still walked on\r\ncrutches, but with the promise of regaining the unassisted use of\r\nhis leg before very long. Throughout the voyage, I hovered near him,\r\nsharing his impatience, his longing for the one we both held dearest.\r\n\r\nOver the exquisite pain of the reunion--at which I was present, yet\r\n_not_ present--I shall pass briefly. More beautiful than ever, more\r\nappealing with her vivid, deep coloring, Velma in the flesh was a\r\nvision that stirred my longing into an intense flame.\r\n\r\nLouis limped painfully down the gangplank. When they met, she rested\r\nher head silently on his shoulder for a moment, then--her eyes brimming\r\nwith tears--assisted him, with the tender solicitude of a mother, to\r\nthe machine she had in waiting.\r\n\r\nTwo months later they were married. I felt the pain of this less deeply\r\nthan I would have done had it not been essential to my designs.\r\n\r\nWhatever vague hope I may have had, however, of vicariously enjoying\r\nthe delights of love were disappointed. I could not have explained\r\nwhy--I only knew that something barred me from intruding upon\r\nthe sacred intimacies of their life, as if a defensive wall were\r\ninterposed. It was baffling, but a very present fact, against which I\r\nfound it useless to rebel. I have since learned--but no matter. * * *\r\n\r\nThis had no bearing on my purpose, which hinged upon the ability I was\r\nacquiring of influencing Louis’ thoughts and actions--of taking partial\r\ncontrol of his faculties.\r\n\r\nThe occupation into which he drifted, restricted in choice as he was by\r\nthe stiffened leg, helped me materially. Often, after an interminable\r\nshift at the bank, he would plod home at night with brain so weary and\r\nbenumbed that it was a simple matter to impress my will upon him. Each\r\nsuccessful attempt, too, made the next one easier.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable consequence was that in time Velma should notice his\r\naberrations and betray concern.\r\n\r\n“Why did you say to me, when you came in last night, ‘There’s a blue\r\nBilly-goat on the stairs--I wish they’d drive him out’?” she demanded\r\none morning.\r\n\r\nHe looked down shamefacedly at the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what made me say it. I seemed to _want_ to say it, and\r\nthat was the only way to get it off my mind. I thought you’d take it\r\nas a joke.” He shifted his shoulders, as if trying to dislodge an\r\nunpleasant burden.\r\n\r\n“And was that what made you wear a necktie to bed?” she asked,\r\nironically.\r\n\r\nHe nodded an affirmative. “I knew it was idiotic--but the idea kept\r\nrunning in my mind. It seemed as if the only way I could go to sleep\r\nwas to give in to it. I don’t have these freaks unless I’m very tired.”\r\n\r\nShe said nothing more at the time, but that evening she broached\r\nthe subject of his looking for an opening in some less sedentary\r\noccupation--a subject to which she thereafter constantly recurred.\r\n\r\nThen came a development that surprised and excited me with its\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nExhausted, drained to the last drop of his nerve-force, Louis was\r\nreturning late one night from the bank, following the usual month-end\r\novertime grind. As he walked from the car-line, I hovered over him,\r\nsubduing his personality, forcing it under control, with the effort\r\nof will I had gradually learned to direct upon him. The process can\r\nonly be explained in a crude way: It was as if I contended with him,\r\nsometimes successfully, for possession of the steering-wheel of the\r\nhuman car that he drove.\r\n\r\nVelma was waiting when we arrived. As Louis’ feet sounded on the\r\nthreshold of their apartment, she opened the door, caught his hands,\r\nand drew him inside.\r\n\r\nAt the action, I felt inexplicably thrilled. It was as if some\r\nmarvelous change had come over me. And then, as I met her gaze, I knew\r\nwhat that change was.\r\n\r\nI held her hands in real flesh-and-blood contact. I was looking at her\r\nwith Louis’ sight!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _V._\r\n\r\nThe shock of it cost me what I had gained. Shaken from my poise, I felt\r\nthe personality I had subdued regain its sway.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, Louis was staring at Velma in bewilderment. Her eyes\r\nwere filled with alarm.\r\n\r\n“You--you _frightened_ me!” she gasped, withdrawing her hands, which I\r\nhad all but crushed. “Louis, dear--don’t _ever_ look at me again like\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\nI can imagine the devouring intensity of gaze that had blazed forth\r\nfrom the features in that brief moment when they were mine.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, my plans quickly took form. Two modes of action\r\npresented themselves. The first and more alluring, however, I was\r\nforced to abandon. It was none other than the wild dream of acquiring\r\nexclusive possession of Louis’ body--of forcing him down, out, and into\r\nthe secondary place I had occupied.\r\n\r\nDespite the progress I had made, this proved inexpressibly difficult.\r\nFor one thing, there seemed an affinity between Louis’ body and his\r\npersonality, which forced me out when he was moderately rested. This\r\nbond I might have weakened, but there were other factors.\r\n\r\nOne was the growing conviction on his part that something was radically\r\nwrong. With a faculty I had discovered of putting myself _en rapport_\r\nwith him and reading his thoughts, I knew that at times he feared that\r\nhe was going insane.\r\n\r\nI once had the experience of accompanying him to an alienist and there,\r\nlike the proverbial fly on the wall, overhearing learned scientific\r\nnames applied to my efforts. The alienist spoke of “dual personality,”\r\n“amnesia,” and “the subconscious mind,” while I laughed in my (shall I\r\nsay?) ghostly sleeve.\r\n\r\nBut he advised Louis to seek a complete rest and, if possible, to go\r\ninto the country to build up physically--which was what I desired most\r\nto prevent.\r\n\r\nI could not play the Mr. Hyde to his Dr. Jekyll if Louis maintained his\r\nnormal virility.\r\n\r\nVelma’s fears, too, I knew were growing more acute. As insistently as\r\nshe could, without betraying too openly her alarm, she pressed him to\r\ngive up the bank position and seek work in the open air--work that\r\nwould prove less devitalizing to a person of his peculiar temperament.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of debility from overwork is, apparently, that it\r\ndeprives the victim of his initiative--makes him fearful of giving up\r\nhis hold upon the meager means of sustenance that he has, lest he shall\r\nbe unable to grasp another. Louis was in debt, earning scarcely enough\r\nfor their living expenses, too proud to let Velma help as she longed to\r\ndo, his game leg putting him at a disadvantage in the industrial field.\r\nIn fact, he was in just the predicament I desired, but I knew that in\r\ntime her wishes would prevail.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances, however, that deprived me of all hope of completely\r\nusurping his place was this: I could not, for any length of time,\r\nface the gaze of Velma’s eyes. The personified truth, the purity that\r\ndwelt in them, seemed to dissolve my power, to beat me back into the\r\nsecondary relationship I had come to occupy toward Louis.\r\n\r\nHe was sometimes tempted to tell her: “You give me my one grip on\r\nsanity.”\r\n\r\nI have witnessed his panic at the thought of losing her, at the thought\r\nthat some day she might give him up in disgust at his aberrations, and\r\nabandon him to the formless “thing” that haunted him.\r\n\r\nCurious--to be of the world and yet not of it--to enjoy a perspective\r\nthat reveals the hidden side of effects, which seem so mysterious from\r\nthe material side of the veil. But I would gladly have given all the\r\nadvantages of my disembodied state for one hour of flesh-and-blood\r\ncompanionship with Velma.\r\n\r\nMy alternative plan was this:\r\n\r\nIf I could not enter her world, what was to prevent me from _bringing\r\nVelma into mine_?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _VI._\r\n\r\nDaring? To be sure.\r\n\r\nUnversed as I was in the laws that govern this mystery of passing from\r\nthe physical into another state of existence, I could only hope that\r\nthe plan would work. It might--and that was enough for me. I took a\r\ngambler’s chance. By risking all, I might gain all--might gain--\r\n\r\nThe thought of what I might gain transported me to a heaven of pain and\r\necstasy.\r\n\r\nVelma and I--in a world apart--a world of our own--free from the sordid\r\ntrammels that mar the perfection of the rosiest earth-existence. Velma\r\nand I--together through all eternity!\r\n\r\nThis much reason I had for hoping! I observed that other persons passed\r\nthrough the change called death, and that some entered a state of\r\nbeing in which I was conscious of them and they of me. Uninteresting\r\ncreatures they were, almost wholly preoccupied with their former\r\nearth-interests; but they were as much in the world as I had been in\r\nthe world of Velma and Louis before that fragment of shrapnel ruled me\r\nout of the game.\r\n\r\nA few, it was true, on passing from their physical habitations,\r\nseemed to emerge into a sphere to which I could not follow. This\r\ntroubled me. Velma might do likewise. Yet I refused to admit the\r\nprobability--refused to consider the possible failure of my plan. The\r\nvery intensity of my longing would draw her to me.\r\n\r\nThe gulf that separated us was spanned by the grave. Once Velma had\r\ncrossed to my side of the abyss, there would be no going back to Louis.\r\n\r\nYet I was cunning. She must not come to me with overpowering regrets\r\nthat would cause her to hover about Louis as I now hovered about her.\r\nIf I could inspire her with horror and loathing for him--ah! if I only\r\ncould!\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary step, I must induce Louis to buy the instrument with\r\nwhich my purpose was to be accomplished. This was not easy, for on\r\nnights when he left the bank during shopping hours he was sufficiently\r\nvigorous to resist my will. I could work only through suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn a pawnshop window that he passed daily I had noticed a revolver\r\nprominently displayed. My whole effort was concentrated upon bringing\r\nthis to his attention.\r\n\r\nThe second night, he glanced at the revolver, but did not stop. Three\r\nnights later, drawn by a fascination for which he could not have\r\naccounted, he paused and looked at it for several minutes, fighting an\r\nurge that seemed to command: “_Step in and buy! Buy! Buy!_”\r\n\r\nWhen, a few evenings later, he arrived home with the revolver and a box\r\nof cartridges that the pawnbroker had included in the sale, he put them\r\nhastily out of sight in a drawer of his desk.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing about his purchase, but the next day Velma came across\r\nthe weapon and questioned him regarding it.\r\n\r\nVisibly confused, he replied: “Oh, I thought we might need something of\r\nthe sort. Saw it in a window, and the notion of having it sort of took\r\nhold of me. There’s been a lot of housebreaking lately, and it’s just\r\nas well to be prepared.”\r\n\r\nAnd now with impatience I waited for the opportunity to stage my\r\n_dénouement_.\r\n\r\nIt came, naturally, at the end of the month, when Louis, after a\r\nprolonged day’s work, returned home, soon after midnight, his brain\r\nbenumbed with poring over interminable columns of figures. When his\r\nfeet ascended the stairs to his apartment it was not his faculties that\r\ndirected them, but mine--cunning, alert, aflame with deadly purpose.\r\n\r\nNever was more weird preliminary to a murder--the entering, in guise of\r\na dear, familiar form, of a fiend incarnate, intent upon destroying the\r\nflower of the home.\r\n\r\nI speak of a fiend incarnate, even though I was that fiend, for I did\r\nnot enter Louis’s body in full expression of my faculties. Taking up\r\nphysical life, my recollection of existence as a spirit entity was\r\nalways shadowy. I carried through the dominating impulses that had\r\nactuated me on entering the body, but scarcely more.\r\n\r\nAnd the impulse I had carried through that night was the impulse to\r\nkill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _VII._\r\n\r\nWith utmost caution, I entered the bedroom.\r\n\r\nMy control of Louis’s body was complete. I felt, for perhaps the first\r\ntime, so corporeally secure that the vague dread of being driven out\r\ndid not oppress me.\r\n\r\nThe room was dark, but the soft, regular breathing of Velma, asleep,\r\nreached my ears. It was like the invitation that rises in the scent of\r\nold wine which the lips are about to quaff--quickening my eagerness and\r\nsetting my brain on fire.\r\n\r\nI did not think of love. I lusted--but my lust was to destroy that\r\nbeautiful body--to _kill_!\r\n\r\nHowever, I was cunning--_cunning_. With caution, I felt my way toward\r\nthe desk and secured the revolver, filling its chambers with leaden\r\nemissaries of death.\r\n\r\nWhen all was in readiness, I switched on the light.\r\n\r\nShe wakened almost instantly. As the radiance flooded the room,\r\na startled cry rose to her lips. It froze, unuttered, as--half\r\nrising--she met my gaze.\r\n\r\nHer beauty--the raven blackness of her hair falling over her bare\r\nshoulders and full, heaving bosom, fanned the flame of my gory passion\r\ninto fury. In an ecstasy of triumph, I stood drinking in the picture.\r\n\r\nWhile I temporized with the lust to kill--prolonging the exquisite\r\nsensation--she was battling for self-control.\r\n\r\n“_Louis!_” The name was gasped through bloodless lips.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, I shrank, reeling a little under her gaze. A dormant\r\nsomething seemed to rise in feeble protest at what I sought to do. The\r\nleveled revolver wavered in my hand.\r\n\r\nBut the note of panic in her voice revived my purpose. I\r\nlaughed--mockingly.\r\n\r\n“Louis!” her tone was sharp, but edged with terror. “Louis--_put down\r\nthat pistol_! You don’t know what you are doing.”\r\n\r\nShe struggled to her feet and now stood before me. God! how\r\nbeautiful--how tempting that bare white bosom!\r\n\r\n“_Put down that pistol!_” she ordered hysterically.\r\n\r\nShe was frantic with fear. And her fear was like the blast of a forge\r\nupon the white heat of my passion.\r\n\r\nI mocked her. A shrill, maniacal laugh burst from my throat. She had\r\nsaid I didn’t know what I was doing! Oh, yes, I did.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to kill you!--_kill you!_” I shrieked, and laughed again.\r\n\r\nShe swayed forward like a wraith, as I fired. Or perhaps that was the\r\ntrick played by my eyes as darkness overwhelmed me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _VIII._\r\n\r\nA few fragmentary pictures stand out in my recollection like\r\nclear-etched cameos on the scroll of the past.\r\n\r\nOne is of Louis, standing dazedly--slightly swaying as with\r\nvertigo--looking down at the smoking revolver in his hand. On the floor\r\nbefore him a crumpled figure in ebony and white and vivid crimson.\r\n\r\nThen a confusion of frightened men and women in oddly assorted\r\nnondescript attire--uniformed officers bursting into the room and\r\ntaking the revolver from Louis’s unresisting hand--clumsy efforts at\r\nlifting the white-robed body to the bed--a crimson stain spreading over\r\nthe sheet--a doctor, attired in collarless shirt and wearing slippers,\r\nbending over her * * *\r\n\r\nFinally, after a lapse of hours, a hushed atmosphere--efficient\r\nnurses--the beginning of delirium.\r\n\r\nAnd one other picture--of Louis, cringing behind the bars of his cell,\r\ndenied the privilege of visiting his wife’s bedside--crushed, dreading\r\nthe hourly announcement of her death--filled with unspeakable horror of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nVelma still lived. The bullet had pierced her left lung and life\r\nhung by a tenuous thread. Hovering near I watched with dispassionate\r\ninterest the battle for life. For the time I seemed emotionally spent.\r\nI had made a supreme effort--events would now take their inevitable\r\ncourse and show whether I had accomplished my purpose. I felt neither\r\nanxious nor overjoyed, neither regretful nor triumphant--merely\r\nimpersonally curious.\r\n\r\nA fever set in lessening Velma’s slender chances of recovery. In her\r\ndelirium, her thoughts seemed always of Louis. Sometimes she breathed\r\nhis name pleadingly, tenderly, then cried out in terror at some\r\nfleeting rehearsal of the scene in which he stood before her, the\r\nglitter of insanity in his eyes, the leveled revolver in his hand.\r\nAgain she pleaded with him to give up his work at the bank; and at\r\nother times she seemed to think of him as over on the battlefields of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOnly once did she apparently think of me--when she whispered the name\r\nby which I had called her, “_Winkie!_” and added, “_Dick!_” But, save\r\nfor this exception, it was always “Louis! Louis!”\r\n\r\nHer constant reiteration of his name finally dispelled the apathy of my\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n_Louis!_ All the vengeful fury toward him I had experienced when my\r\nsoul went hurtling into the region of the disembodied returned with\r\nthwarted intensity.\r\n\r\nWhen Velma’s fever subsided, when the long fight for recovery began and\r\nshe fluttered from the borderland back into the realm of the physical,\r\nwhen I knew I had failed--balked of my prey, I had at least this\r\nsatisfaction:\r\n\r\nNever again would these two--the man I hated and the woman for whom I\r\nhungered--never again would they be to each other as they had been in\r\nthe past. The perfection of their love had been irretrievably marred.\r\nNever would she meet his gaze without an inward shrinking. Always on\r\nhis part--on both their parts--there would be an undercurrent of fear\r\nthat the incident might recur--a grizzly menace, poisoning each moment\r\nof their lives together.\r\n\r\nI had not schemed and contrived--and dared--in vain.\r\n\r\nThis was the thought I hugged when Louis was released from jail, upon\r\nher refusal to prosecute. It caused me sardonic amusement when, in\r\ntheir first embrace, the tears of despair rained down their cheeks. It\r\nrecurred when they began their pitiful attempt to build anew on the\r\nshattered foundation of love.\r\n\r\nAnd then--creepingly, slyly, like a bird of ill omen casting the shadow\r\nof its silent wings over the landscape--came retribution.\r\n\r\nMany times, in retrospect, I lived over that brief hour of my return to\r\nphysical expression--my hour of realization. Wraithlike, arose a vision\r\nof Velma--Velma as she had stood before me that night, staring at me\r\nwith horror. I saw the horror deepen--deepen to abject despair.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful she had looked! But when I tried to picture that beauty,\r\nI could recall only her eyes. It mattered not whether I wished to see\r\nthem--they filled my vision.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to haunt me. From being vaguely conscious of them, I\r\nbecame acutely so. Disconcertingly, they looked out at me from\r\neverywhere--eyes brimming with fear--eyes fixed and staring--filled\r\nwith horrified accusation.\r\n\r\nThe beauty I had once coveted became a thing forbidden, even in memory.\r\nIf I sought to peer through the veil as formerly--to witness her\r\npathetic attempts to resume the old life with Louis--again those eyes!\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps sound strange for a disembodied creature--one whom you\r\nwould call a ghost--to wail of being haunted. Yet haunting is of the\r\nspirit, and we of the spirit world are immeasurably more subject to its\r\nconditions than those whose consciousness is centered in the material\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nGod! Those eyes. There is a refinement of physical torture which\r\nconsists of allowing water to fall, drop by drop, for an eternity\r\nof hours, upon the forehead of the victim. Conceive of this torture\r\nincreased a thousandfold, and a faint idea may be gained of the torture\r\nthat was mine--from seeing everywhere, constantly, interminably, two\r\norbs ever filled with the same expression of horror and reproach.\r\n\r\nMuch have I learned since entering the Land of the Shades. At that time\r\nI did not know, as I know now, that my punishment was no affliction\r\nfrom without, but the simple result of natural law. Causes set in\r\nmotion must work out their full reaction. The pebble, cast into a quiet\r\npool, makes ripples which in time return to the place of their origin.\r\nI had cast more than a pebble of disturbance into the harmony of human\r\nlife, and through my intense preoccupation in a single aim had delayed\r\nlonger than usual the reaction, I created for myself a hell. Inevitably\r\nI was drawn into it.\r\n\r\nGone was every desire I had known to hover near the two who had so long\r\nengrossed my attention. Haunted, harried, scourged by those dreadful\r\naccusers, I sought to fly from them to the ends of the earth. There was\r\nno escape, yet, driven frantic, I still struggled to escape, because\r\nthat is the blind impulse of suffering creatures.\r\n\r\nThe emotions that had so swayed me when I tried to blast the lives of\r\ntwo who held me dear now seemed puny and insignificant in comparison\r\nwith my suffering. No physical torment can be likened to that which\r\nengulfed me until my very being was but a seething mass of agony.\r\nThrough it, I hurled maledictions upon the world, upon myself, upon the\r\ncreator. Horrible blasphemies I uttered.\r\n\r\nAnd, at last--I prayed.\r\n\r\nIt was but a cry for mercy--the inarticulate appeal of a tortured soul\r\nfor surcease of pain--but suddenly a peace seemed to have come upon the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nBereft of suffering, I felt like one who has ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nOut of the silence came a wordless response. It beat upon my\r\nconsciousness like the buffeting of the waves.\r\n\r\nWords known to human ears would not convey the meaning of the message\r\nthat was borne upon me--whether from outside source or welling up from\r\nwithin, I do not know. All I know is that it filled me with a strange\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nA thousand years or a single instant--for time is a relative thing--the\r\nrespite lasted. Then, I sank, as it seemed, to the old level of\r\nconsciousness, and the torment was renewed.\r\n\r\nEndure it now I knew that I must--and why. A strange new purpose filled\r\nmy being. The light of understanding had dawned upon my soul.\r\n\r\nAnd so I came to resume my vigil in the home of Velma and Louis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IX._\r\n\r\nA brave heart was Velma’s--dauntless and true.\r\n\r\nWith the effects of the tragedy still apparent in her pallor and\r\nweakness, and in the shaken demeanor and furtive, self-distrustful\r\nattitude of Louis, she yet succeeded in finding a place for him as\r\noverseer of a small country estate.\r\n\r\nI have said that I ceased to feel the torment of passion for Velma in\r\nthe greater torment of her reproach. Ah! but I had never ceased to love\r\nher. As I now realized, I had desecrated that love, had transmuted\r\nit into a horrible travesty, had, in my abysmal ignorance, sought to\r\nobtain what I desired by destroying it; yet, beneath all, I had loved.\r\n\r\nWell I know, now, that had I succeeded in my intention toward her,\r\nVelma would have ascended to a sphere utterly beyond my comprehension.\r\nMerciful fate had diverted my aim--had made possible some faint\r\nrestitution.\r\n\r\nI returned to Velma, loving her with a love that had come into its own,\r\na love unselfish, untainted by thought of possession.\r\n\r\nBut, to help her, I must again hurt her cruelly.\r\n\r\nOut of the chaos of her life she had slowly restored a semblance of\r\nharmony. Almost she succeeded in convincing Louis that their old\r\npeaceful companionship had returned; but to one who could read her\r\nthoughts, the nightmare thing that hovered between them weighed cruelly\r\nupon her soul.\r\n\r\nShe was never quite able to look into her husband’s eyes without a\r\nlurking suspicion of what might lie in their depths; never able to\r\ncompose herself for sleep without a tremor lest she should wake to find\r\nherself confronted by a fiend in his form. I had done my work only too\r\nwell!\r\n\r\nNow, slowly and inexorably, I began again undermining Louis’ mental\r\ncontrol. The old ground must be traversed anew, because he had gained\r\nin strength from the respite I had allowed him, and his outdoor life\r\ngave him a mental vigor with which I had not been obliged to contend\r\nbefore. On the other hand, I was equipped with new knowledge of the\r\npower I intended to wield.\r\n\r\nI shall not relate again the successive stages by which I succeeded,\r\nfirst in influencing his will, then in partially subduing it, and,\r\nfinally, in driving his personality into the background for indefinite\r\nperiods. The terror that overwhelmed him when he realized that he was\r\nbecoming a prey to his former aberrations may be imagined.\r\n\r\nTo shield Velma, I performed my experiments, when possible, while he\r\nwas away from her. But she could not long be unaware of the moodiness,\r\nthe haggard droop of his shoulders which accompanied his realization\r\nthat the old malady had returned. The deepening terror in her\r\nexpression was like a scourge upon my spirit--but I must wound her in\r\norder to cure.\r\n\r\nMore than once, I was forced to exert my power over Louis to prevent\r\nhim from taking violent measures against himself. As I gained the\r\nascendancy, a determination to end it all grew upon him. He feared\r\nthat unless he took himself out of Velma’s life, the insanity would\r\nreturn and force him again to commit a frenzied assault upon the one\r\nhe held most dear. Nor could he avoid seeing the apprehension in her\r\nmanner that told him she knew--the shrinking that she bravely tried to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\nThough my power over him was greater than before, it was intermittent.\r\nI could not always exercise it. I could not, for example, prevent his\r\nborrowing a revolver one day from a neighboring farmer, on pretense of\r\nusing it against a marauding dog that had lately visited the poultry\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nThough I knew his true intention, the utmost that I could do--for his\r\npersonality was strong at the time--was to influence him to postpone\r\nthe deed he contemplated.\r\n\r\nThat night, I took possession of his body while he slept. Velma lay,\r\nbreathing quietly, in the next room--for as this dreaded thing came\r\nupon him they had, through tacit understanding, come to occupy separate\r\nbedrooms.\r\n\r\nPartially dressing, I stole downstairs and out to the tool-shed where\r\nLouis--fearing to trust it near him in the house--had hidden the\r\nrevolver. As I returned, my whole being rebelled at the task before\r\nme--yet it was unavoidable, if I would restore to Velma what I had\r\nwrenched from her.\r\n\r\nQuietly though I entered her room, a gasp--or rather a quick,\r\nhysterical intake of breath--warned me that she had wakened.\r\n\r\nI flashed on the light.\r\n\r\nShe made no sound. Her face went white as marble. The expression in\r\nher eyes was that which had tortured me into the depths of a hell more\r\nfrightful than any conceived by human imagination.\r\n\r\nA moment I stood swaying before her, with leveled revolver--as I had\r\nstood on that other occasion, months before.\r\n\r\nSlowly, I lowered the revolver, and smiled--not as Louis would have\r\nsmiled but as a maniac, formed in his likeness, would have smiled.\r\n\r\nHer lips framed the word “Louis,” but, in the grip of despair, she made\r\nno sound. It was the despair not merely of a woman who felt herself\r\ndoomed to death, but of a woman who consigned her loved one to a fate\r\nworse than death.\r\n\r\nStill I smiled--with growing difficulty, for Louis’ personality was\r\nrestive and my time in the usurped body was short.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, I was not anxious to give up his body. At this new\r\nglimpse of her beauty through physical sight, my love for Velma flamed\r\ninto hitherto unrealized intensity. For an instant my purpose in\r\nreturning was forgotten. Forgotten was the knowledge of the ages which\r\nI had sipped since last I occupied the body in which I faced her.\r\nForgotten was everything save--Velma.\r\n\r\nAs I took a step forward, my arms outstretched, my eyes expressing God\r\nknows what depth of yearning, she uttered a scream.\r\n\r\nBlackness surged over me. I stumbled. I was being forced out--out----\r\nThat cry of terror had vibrated through the soul of Louis and he was\r\nstruggling to answer it.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, I battled against the darkness, clung to my hard-won\r\nascendancy. A moment of conflict, and again I prevailed.\r\n\r\nOnce more I smiled. The effect of it must have been weird, for I was\r\ngrowing weaker and Louis had returned to the attack with overwhelming\r\npersistence. My tongue strove for expression:\r\n\r\n“_Sorry--Winkie--it won’t happen again--I’m not--coming--back----_”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I recovered from the momentary unconsciousness that accompanies\r\ntransition from the physical to spiritual, Louis was looking in\r\naffright at the huddled figure of Velma, who had fainted away. The next\r\ninstant, he had gathered her in his arms.\r\n\r\nThough I had come near failing in the attempt to deliver my message, I\r\nhad no fear that my visit would prove in vain. With clear prescience, I\r\nknew that my utterance of that old familiar nickname, “_Winkie_,” would\r\ncarry untold meaning to Velma--that hereafter she would fear no more\r\nwhat she might see in the depths of her husband’s eyes--that with a\r\nreturn of her old confidence in him, the specter of apprehension would\r\nbe banished forever from their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 OOZE\r\n\r\n                  _A Novelette of a Thousand Thrills_\r\n\r\n                          _By_ ANTHONY M. RUD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the heart of a second-growth piney-woods jungle of southern Alabama,\r\na region sparsely settled save by backwoods blacks and Cajans--that\r\nqueer, half-wild people descended from Acadian exiles of the middle\r\neighteenth century--stands a strange, enormous ruin.\r\n\r\nInterminable trailers of Cherokee rose, white-laden during a single\r\nmonth of spring, have climbed the heights of its three remaining walls.\r\nPalmetto fans rise knee high above the base. A dozen scattered live\r\noaks, now belying their nomenclature because of choking tufts of gray,\r\nSpanish moss and two-foot circlets of mistletoe parasite which have\r\nstripped bare of foliage the gnarled, knotted limbs, lean fantastic\r\nbeards against the crumbling brick.\r\n\r\nImmediately beyond, where the ground becomes soggier and\r\nlower--dropping away hopelessly into the tangle of dogwood, holly,\r\npoison sumac and pitcher plants that is Moccasin Swamp--undergrowth of\r\ntiti and annis has formed a protecting wall impenetrable to all save\r\nthe furtive ones. Some few outcasts utilize the stinking depths of that\r\nsinister swamp, distilling “shinny” or “pure cawn” liquor for illicit\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nTradition states that this is the case, at least--a tradition which\r\nantedates that of the premature ruin by many decades. I believe it,\r\nfor during evenings intervening between investigations of the awesome\r\nspot I often was approached as a possible customer by wood-billies\r\nwho could not fathom how anyone dared venture near without plenteous\r\nfortification of liquid courage.\r\n\r\nI knew “shinny,” therefore I did not purchase it for personal\r\nconsumption. A dozen times I bought a quart or two, merely to establish\r\ncredit among the Cajans, pouring away the vile stuff immediately into\r\nthe sodden ground. It seemed then that only through filtration and\r\ncondensation of their dozens of weird tales regarding “Daid House”\r\ncould I arrive at understanding of the mystery and weight of horror\r\nhanging about the place.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that out of all the superstitious cautioning,\r\nhead-wagging and whispered nonsensities I obtained only two\r\nindisputable facts. The first was that no money, and no supporting\r\nbattery of ten-gauge shotguns loaded with chilled shot, could induce\r\neither Cajan or darky of the region to approach within five hundred\r\nyards of that flowering wall! The second fact I shall dwell upon later.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be as well, as I am only a mouthpiece in this\r\nchronicle, to relate in brief why I came to Alabama on this mission.\r\n\r\nI am a scribbler of general fact articles, no fiction writer as was\r\nLee Cranmer--though doubtless the confession is superfluous. Lee was\r\nmy roommate during college days. I knew his family well, admiring John\r\nCorliss Cranmer even more than I admired the son and friend--and almost\r\nas much as Peggy Breede whom Lee married. Peggy liked me, but that was\r\nall. I cherish sanctified memory of her for just that much, as no\r\nother woman before or since has granted this gangling dyspeptic even a\r\nhint of joyous and sorrowful intimacy.\r\n\r\nWork kept me to the city. Lee, on the other hand, coming of wealthy\r\nfamily--and, from the first, earning from his short-stories and\r\nnovel royalties more than I wrested from editorial coffers--needed\r\nno anchorage. He and Peggy honeymooned a four-month trip to Alaska,\r\nvisited Honolulu next winter, fished for salmon on Cain’s River, New\r\nBrunswick, and generally enjoyed the outdoors at all seasons.\r\n\r\nThey kept an apartment in Wilmette, near Chicago, yet, during the few\r\nspring and fall seasons they were “home,” both preferred to rent a\r\nsuite at one of the country clubs to which Lee belonged. I suppose they\r\nspent thrice or five times the amount Lee actually earned, yet for my\r\npart I only honored that the two should find such great happiness in\r\nlife and still accomplish artistic triumph.\r\n\r\nThey were honest, zestful young Americans, the type--and pretty\r\nnearly the _only_ type--two million dollars cannot spoil. John\r\nCorliss Cranmer, father of Lee, though as different from his boy as a\r\nmicroscope is different from a painting by Remington, was even further\r\nfrom being dollar conscious. He lived in a world bounded only by the\r\nwidening horizon of biological science--and his love for the two who\r\nwould carry on that Cranmer name.\r\n\r\nMany a time I used to wonder how it could be that as gentle,\r\nclean-souled and lovable a gentleman as John Corliss Cranmer could\r\nhave ventured so far into scientific research without attaining\r\nsmall-caliber atheism. Few do. He believed both in God and human kind.\r\nTo accuse him of murdering his boy and the girl wife who had come to be\r\nloved as the mother of baby Elsie--as well as blood and flesh of his\r\nown family--was a gruesome, terrible absurdity! Yes, even when John\r\nCorliss Cranmer was declared unmistakably insane!\r\n\r\nLacking a relative in the world, baby Elsie was given to me--and the\r\nmiddle-aged couple who had accompanied the three as servants about half\r\nof the known world. Elsie would be Peggy over again. I worshiped her,\r\nknowing that if my stewardship of her interests could make of her a\r\nwoman of Peggy’s loveliness and worth I should not have lived in vain.\r\nAnd at four Elsie stretched out her arms to me after a vain attempt to\r\njerk out the bobbed tail of Lord Dick, my tolerant old Airedale--and\r\ncalled me “papa.”\r\n\r\nI felt a deep down choking ... yes, those strangely long black lashes\r\nsome day might droop in fun or coquetry, but now baby Elsie held a\r\nwistful, trusting seriousness in depths of ultramarine eyes--that same\r\nseriousness which only Lee had brought to Peggy.\r\n\r\nResponsibility in one instant became double. That she might come to\r\nlove me as more than foster parent was my dearest wish. Still, through\r\nselfishness I could not rob her of rightful heritage; she must know\r\nin after years. And the tale that I would tell her must not be the\r\nhorrible suspicion which had been bandied about in common talk!\r\n\r\nI went to Alabama, leaving Elsie in the competent hands of Mrs. Daniels\r\nand her husband, who had helped care for her since birth.\r\n\r\nIn my possession, prior to the trip, were the scant facts known\r\nto authorities at the time of John Corliss Cranmer’s escape and\r\ndisappearance. They were incredible enough.\r\n\r\nFor conducting biological research upon forms of protozoan life, John\r\nCorliss Cranmer had hit upon this region of Alabama. Near a great swamp\r\nteeming with microscopic organisms, and situated in a semi-tropical\r\nbelt where freezing weather rarely intruded to harden the bogs, the\r\nspot seemed ideal for his purpose.\r\n\r\nThrough Mobile he could secure supplies daily by truck. The isolation\r\nsuited. With only an octoroon man to act as chef, houseman and valet\r\nfor the times he entertained no visitors, he brought down scientific\r\napparatus, occupying temporary quarters in the village of Burdett’s\r\nCorners while his woods house was in process of construction.\r\n\r\nBy all accounts the Lodge, as he termed it, was a substantial affair\r\nof eight or nine rooms, built of logs and planed lumber bought at Oak\r\nGrove. Lee and Peggy were expected to spend a portion of each year\r\nwith him; quail, wild turkey and deer abounded, which fact made such a\r\nvacation certain to please the pair. At other times all save four rooms\r\nwas closed.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1907, the year of Lee’s marriage. Six years later when\r\nI came down, no sign of a house remained except certain mangled and\r\nrotting timbers projecting from viscid soil--or what seemed like soil.\r\nAnd a twelve-foot wall of brick had been built to enclose the house\r\ncompletely! One portion of this had fallen _inward_!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\nI wasted weeks of time at first, interviewing officials of the\r\npolice department at Mobile, the town marshals and county sheriffs\r\nof Washington and Mobile counties, and officials of the psychopathic\r\nhospital from which Cranmer made his escape.\r\n\r\nIn substance the story was one of baseless homicidal mania. Cranmer\r\nthe elder had been away until late fall, attending two scientific\r\nconferences in the North, and then going abroad to compare certain\r\nof his findings with those of a Dr. Gemmler of Prague University.\r\nUnfortunately, Gemmler was assassinated by a religious fanatic shortly\r\nafterward. The fanatic voiced virulent objection to all Mendelian\r\nresearch as blasphemous. This was his only defense. He was hanged.\r\n\r\nSearch of Gemmler’s notes and effects revealed nothing save an immense\r\namount of laboratory data on _karyokinesis_--the process of chromosome\r\narrangement occurring in first growing cells of higher animal embryos.\r\nApparently Cranmer had hoped to develop some similarities, or point\r\nout differences between hereditary factors occurring in lower forms of\r\nlife and those half-demonstrated in the cat and monkey. The authorities\r\nhad found nothing that helped me. Cranmer had gone crazy; was that not\r\nsufficient explanation?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was for them, but not for me--and Elsie.\r\n\r\nBut to the slim basis of fact I was able to unearth:\r\n\r\nNo one wondered when a fortnight passed without appearance of any\r\nperson from the Lodge. Why should anyone worry? A provision salesman in\r\nMobile called up twice, but failed to complete a connection. He merely\r\nshrugged. The Cranmers had gone away somewhere on a trip. In a week, a\r\nmonth, a year they would be back. Meanwhile he lost commissions, but\r\nwhat of it? He had no responsibility for these queer nuts up there in\r\nthe piney-woods. Crazy? Of course! Why should any guy with millions to\r\nspend shut himself up among the Cajans and draw microscope-enlarged\r\nnotebook pictures of--what the salesman called--“germs?”\r\n\r\nA stir was aroused at the end of the fortnight, but the commotion\r\nconfined itself to building circles. Twenty carloads of building\r\nbrick, fifty bricklayers, and a quarter-acre of fine-meshed wire--the\r\nsort used for screening off pens of rodents and small marsupials in a\r\nzoological garden--were ordered, _damn expense, hurry!_ by an unshaved,\r\ntattered man who identified himself with difficulty as John Corliss\r\nCranmer.\r\n\r\nHe looked strange, even then. A certified check for the total amount,\r\ngiven in advance, and another check of absurd size slung toward a labor\r\n_entrepreneur_, silenced objection, however. These millionaires were\r\napt to be flighty. When they wanted something they wanted it at tap\r\nof the bell. Well, why not drag down the big profits? A poorer man\r\nwould have been jacked up in a day. Cranmer’s fluid gold bathed him in\r\nimmunity to criticism.\r\n\r\nThe encircling wall was built, and roofed with wire netting which\r\ndrooped about the squat-pitch of the Lodge. Curious inquiries of\r\nworkmen went unanswered until the final day.\r\n\r\nThen Cranmer, a strange, intense apparition who showed himself more\r\nshabby than a quay derelict, assembled every man jack of the workmen.\r\nIn one hand he grasped a wad of blue slips--fifty-six of them. In the\r\nother he held a Luger automatic.\r\n\r\n“I offer each man a thousand dollars for _silence_!” he announced.\r\n“As an alternative--_death_! You know little. Will all of you consent\r\nto swear upon your honor that nothing which has occurred here will be\r\nmentioned elsewhere? By this I mean _absolute_ silence! You will not\r\ncome back here to investigate anything. You will not tell your wives.\r\nYou will not open your mouths even upon the witness stand in case you\r\nare called! My price is one thousand apiece.\r\n\r\n“In case one of you betrays me _I give you my word that this man shall\r\ndie_! I am rich. I can hire men to do murder. Well, what do you say?”\r\n\r\nThe men glanced apprehensively about. The threatening Luger decided\r\nthem. To a man they accepted the blue slips--and, save for one witness\r\nwho lost all sense of fear and morality in drink, none of the fifty-six\r\nhas broken his pledge, as far as I know. That one bricklayer died later\r\nin delirium tremens.\r\n\r\nIt might have been different had not John Corliss Cranmer escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _III._\r\n\r\nThey found him the first time, mouthing meaningless phrases concerning\r\nan amœba--one of the tiny forms of protoplasmic life he was known to\r\nhave studied. Also he leaped into a hysteria of self-accusation. He had\r\nmurdered two innocent people! The tragedy was his crime. He had drowned\r\nthem in ooze! Ah, God!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for all concerned, Cranmer, dazed and indubitably stark\r\ninsane, chose to perform a strange travesty on fishing four miles\r\nto the west of his lodge--on the further border of Moccasin Swamp.\r\nHis clothing had been torn to shreds, his hat was gone, and he was\r\ncoated from head to foot with gluey mire. It was far from strange that\r\nthe good folk of Shanksville, who never had glimpsed the eccentric\r\nmillionaire, failed to associate him with Cranmer.\r\n\r\nThey took him in, searched his pockets--finding no sign save an\r\ninordinate sum of money--and then put him under medical care. Two\r\nprecious weeks elapsed before Dr. Quirk reluctantly acknowledged that\r\nhe could do nothing more for this patient, and notified the proper\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThen much more time was wasted. Hot April and half of still hotter May\r\npassed by before the loose ends were connected. Then it did little\r\ngood to know that this raving unfortunate was Cranmer, or that the\r\ntwo persons of whom he shouted in disconnected delirium actually had\r\ndisappeared. Alienists absolved him of responsibility. He was confined\r\nin a cell reserved for the violent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, strange things occurred back at the Lodge--which now, for\r\ngood and sufficient reason, was becoming known to dwellers of the woods\r\nas Dead House. Until one of the walls fell in, however, there had been\r\nno chance to see--unless one possessed the temerity to climb either one\r\nof the tall live oaks, or mount the barrier itself. No doors or opening\r\nof any sort had been placed in that hastily-constructed wall!\r\n\r\nBy the time the western side of the wall fell, not a native for\r\nmiles around but feared the spot far more than even the bottomless,\r\nsnake-infested bogs which lay to west and north.\r\n\r\nThe single statement was all John Corliss Cranmer ever gave to the\r\nworld. It proved sufficient. An immediate search was instituted. It\r\nshowed that less than three weeks before the day of initial reckoning,\r\nhis son and Peggy had come to visit him for the second time that\r\nwinter--leaving Elsie behind in company of the Daniels pair. They had\r\nrented a pair of Gordons for quail hunting, and had gone out. That was\r\nthe last anyone had seen of them.\r\n\r\nThe backwoods negro who glimpsed them stalking a covey behind their two\r\npointing dogs had known no more--even when sweated through twelve hours\r\nof third degree. Certain suspicious circumstances (having to do only\r\nwith his regular pursuit of “shinny” transportation) had caused him to\r\nfall under suspicious at first. He was dropped.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the scientist himself was apprehended--a gibbering idiot\r\nwho sloughed his pole--holding on to the baited hook--into a marsh\r\nwhere nothing save moccasins, an errant alligator, or amphibian life\r\ncould have been snared.\r\n\r\nHis mind was three-quarters dead. Cranmer then was in the state of\r\nthe dope fiend who rouses to a sitting position to ask seriously how\r\nmany Bolshevists were killed by Julius Caesar before he was stabbed\r\nby Brutus, or why it was that Roller canaries sang only on Wednesday\r\nevenings. He knew that tragedy of the most sinister sort had stalked\r\nthrough his life--but little more, at first.\r\n\r\nLater the police obtained that one statement that he had murdered two\r\nhuman beings, but never could means or motive be established. Official\r\nguess as to the means was no more than wild conjecture; it mentioned\r\nenticing the victims to the noisome depths of Moccasin Swamp, there to\r\nlet them flounder and sink.\r\n\r\nThe two were his son and daughter-in-law, Lee and Peggy!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IV._\r\n\r\nBy feigning coma--then awakening with suddenness to assault three\r\nattendants with incredible ferocity and strength--John Corliss Cranmer\r\nescaped from Elizabeth Ritter Hospital.\r\n\r\nHow he hid, how he managed to traverse sixty-odd intervening miles\r\nand still balk detection, remains a minor mystery to be explained\r\nonly by the assumption that maniacal cunning sufficed to outwit saner\r\nintellects.\r\n\r\nTraverse these miles he did, though until I was fortunate enough to\r\nuncover evidence to this effect, it was supposed generally that he had\r\nmade his escape as stowaway on one of the banana boats, or had buried\r\nhimself in some portion of the nearer woods where he was unknown. The\r\ntruth ought to be welcome to householders of Shanksville, Burdett’s\r\nCorners and vicinage--those excusably prudent ones who to this day keep\r\nloaded shotguns handy and barricade their doors at nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe first ten days of my investigation may be touched upon in brief.\r\nI made headquarters in Burdett’s Corners, and drove out each morning,\r\ncarrying lunch and returning for my grits and piney-woods pork or\r\nmutton before nightfall. My first plan had been to camp out at the\r\nedge of the swamp, for opportunity to enjoy the outdoors comes rarely\r\nin my direction. Yet after one cursory examination of the premises I\r\nabandoned the idea. I did not _want_ to camp alone there. And I am less\r\nsuperstitious than a real estate agent.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, psychic warning; more probably the queer, faint,\r\nsalty odor as of fish left to decay, which hung about the ruin, made\r\ntoo unpleasant an impression upon my olfactory sense. I experienced a\r\ndistinct chill every time the lengthening shadows caught me near Dead\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe smell impressed me. In newspaper reports of the case one ingenious\r\nexplanation had been worked out. To the rear of the spot where Dead\r\nHouse had stood--inside the wall--was a swampy hollow circular in\r\nshape. Only a little real mud lay in the bottom of the bowllike\r\ndepression now, but one reporter on the staff of _The Mobile Register_\r\nguessed that during the tenancy of the lodge it had been a fishpool.\r\nDrying up of the water had killed the fish, who now permeated the\r\nremnant of mud with this foul odor.\r\n\r\nThe possibility that Cranmer had needed to keep fresh fish at hand\r\nfor some of his experiments silenced the natural objection that in a\r\ncountry where every stream holds gar pike, bass, catfish and many other\r\nedible varieties, no one would dream of stocking a stagnant puddle.\r\n\r\nAfter tramping about the enclosure, testing the queerly brittle,\r\ndesiccated top stratum of earth within and speculating concerning the\r\npossible purpose of the wall, I cut off a long limb of chinaberry and\r\nprobed the mud. One fragment of fish spine would confirm the guess of\r\nthat imaginative reporter.\r\n\r\nI found nothing resembling a piscal skeleton, but established several\r\nfacts. First, this mud crater had definite bottom only three or four\r\nfeet below the surface of remaining ooze. Second, the fishy stench\r\nbecame stronger as I stirred. Third, at one time the mud, water, or\r\nwhatever had comprised the balance of content, had reached the rim\r\nof the bowl. The last showed by certain marks plain enough when the\r\ncrusty, two-inch stratum of upper coating was broken away. It was\r\npuzzling.\r\n\r\nThe nature of that thin, desiccated effluvium which seemed to cover\r\neverything even to the lower foot or two of brick, came in for next\r\ninspection. It was strange stuff, unlike any earth I ever had seen,\r\nthough undoubtedly some form of scum drained in from the swamp at the\r\ntime of river floods or cloudbursts (which in this section are common\r\nenough in spring and fall). It crumbled beneath the fingers. When I\r\nwalked over it, the stuff crunched hollowly. In fainter degree it\r\npossessed the fishy odor also.\r\n\r\nI took some samples where it lay thickest upon the ground, and also a\r\nfew where there seemed to be no more than a depth of a sheet of paper.\r\nLater I would have a laboratory analysis made.\r\n\r\nApart from any possible bearing the stuff might have upon the\r\ndisappearance of my three friends, I felt the tug of article\r\ninterest--that wonder over anything strange or seemingly inexplicable\r\nwhich lends the hunt for fact a certain glamor and romance all its own.\r\nTo myself I was going to have to explain sooner or later just why this\r\nlayer covered the entire space within the walls and was not perceptible\r\n_anywhere_ outside! The enigma could wait, however--or so I decided.\r\n\r\nFar more interesting were the traces of violence apparent on wall and\r\nwhat once had been a house. The latter seemed to have been ripped\r\nfrom its foundations by a giant hand, crushed out of semblance to a\r\ndwelling, and then cast in fragments about the base of wall--mainly\r\non the south side, where heaps of twisted, broken timbers lay in\r\nprofusion. On the opposite side there had been such heaps once, but\r\nnow only charred sticks, coated with that gray-black, omnipresent coat\r\nof desiccation, remained. These piles of charcoal had been sifted and\r\nexamined most carefully by the authorities, as one theory had been\r\nadvanced that Cranmer had burned the bodies of his victims. Yet no sign\r\nwhatever of human remains was discovered.\r\n\r\nThe fire, however, pointed out one odd fact which controverted\r\nthe reconstructions made by detectives months before. The latter,\r\nsuggesting the dried scum to have drained in from the swamp, believed\r\nthat the house timbers had floated out to the sides of the wall--there\r\nto arrange themselves in a series of piles! The absurdity of such a\r\ntheory showed even more plainly in the fact that _if_ the scum had\r\nfiltered through in such a flood, the timbers most certainly had been\r\ndragged into piles _previously_! Some had burned--_and the scum coated\r\ntheir charred surfaces_!\r\n\r\nWhat had been the force which had torn the lodge to bits as if in\r\nspiteful fury? Why had the parts of the wreckage been burned, the rest\r\nto escape?\r\n\r\nRight here I felt was the keynote to the mystery, yet I could imagine\r\nno explanation. That John Corliss Cranmer himself--physically sound,\r\nyet a man who for decades had led a sedentary life--could have\r\naccomplished such destruction, unaided, was difficult to believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _V._\r\n\r\nI turned my attention to the wall, hoping for evidence which might\r\nsuggest another theory.\r\n\r\nThat wall had been an example of the worst snide construction. Though\r\nlittle more than a year old, the parts left standing showed evidence\r\nthat they had begun to decay the day the last brick was laid. The\r\nmortar had fallen from the interstices. Here and there a brick had\r\ncracked and dropped out. Fibrils of the climbing vines had penetrated\r\ncrevices, working for early destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd one side already had fallen.\r\n\r\nIt was here that the first glimmering suspicion of the terrible truth\r\nwas forced upon me. The scattered bricks, even those which had rolled\r\ninward toward the gaping foundation lodge, _had not been coated with\r\nscum_! This was curious, yet it could be explained by surmise that the\r\nflood itself undermined this weakest portion of the wall. I cleared\r\naway a mass of brick from the spot on which the structure had stood; to\r\nmy surprise I found it exceptionally firm! Hard red clay lay beneath!\r\nThe flood conception was faulty; only some great force, exerted from\r\ninside or outside, could have wreaked such destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen careful measurement, analysis and deduction convinced me--mainly\r\nfrom the fact that the lowermost layers of brick all had fallen\r\n_outward_, while the upper portions toppled _in_--I began to link up\r\nthis mysterious and horrific force with the one which had rent the\r\nLodge asunder. It looked as though a typhoon or gigantic centrifuge had\r\nneeded elbow room in ripping down the wooden structure.\r\n\r\nBut I got nowhere with the theory, though in ordinary affairs I am\r\ncalled a man of too great imaginative tendencies. No less than three\r\neditors have cautioned me on this point. Perhaps it was the narrowing\r\ninfluence of great personal sympathy--yes, and love. I make no excuses,\r\nthough beyond a dim understanding that some terrific, implacable force\r\nmust have made this spot his playground, I ended my ninth day of\r\nnote-taking and investigation almost as much in the dark as I had been\r\nwhile a thousand miles away in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThen I started among the darkies and Cajans. A whole day I listened\r\nto yarns of the days which preceded Cranmer’s escape from Elizabeth\r\nRitter Hospital--days in which furtive men sniffed poisoned air for\r\nmiles around Dead House, finding the odor intolerable. Days in which\r\nit seemed none possessed nerve enough to approach close. Days when the\r\nmost fanciful tales of mediaeval superstitions were spun. These tales I\r\nshall not give; the truth is incredible enough.\r\n\r\nAt noon upon the eleventh day I chanced upon Rori Pailleron, a\r\nCajan--and one of the least prepossessing of all with whom I had come\r\nin contact. “Chanced” perhaps is a bad word. I had listed every dweller\r\nof the woods within a five mile radius. Rori was sixteenth on my list.\r\nI went to him only after interviewing all four of the Crabiers and\r\ntwo whole families of Pichons. And Rori regarded me with the utmost\r\nsuspicion until I made him a present of the two quarts of “shinny”\r\npurchased of the Pichons.\r\n\r\nBecause long practice has perfected me in the technique of seeming\r\nto drink another man’s awful liquor--no, I’m not an absolute\r\nprohibitionist; fine wine or twelve-year-in-cask Bourbon whisky arouses\r\nmy definite interest--I fooled Pailleron from the start. I shall omit\r\npreliminaries, and leap to the first admission from him that he knew\r\nmore concerning Dead House and its former inmates than any of the other\r\ndarkies or Cajans roundabout.\r\n\r\n“...But I ain’t talkin’. _Sacre!_ If I should open my gab, what might\r\nfly out? It is for keeping silent, y’r damn’ right!...”\r\n\r\nI agreed. He was a wise man--educated to some extent in the queer\r\nschools and churches maintained exclusively by Cajans in the depths of\r\nthe woods, yet naive withal.\r\n\r\nWe drank. And I never had to ask another leading question. The liquor\r\nmade him want to interest me; and the only extraordinary topic in this\r\nwhole neck of the woods was the Dead House.\r\n\r\nThree-quarters of a pint of acrid, nauseous fluid, and he hinted\r\ndarkly. A pint, and he told me something I scarcely could believe.\r\nAnother half-pint.... But I shall give his confession in condensed form.\r\n\r\nHe had known Joe Sibley, the octoroon chef, houseman and valet who\r\nserved Cranmer. Through Joe, Rori had furnished certain indispensables\r\nin way of food to the Cranmer household. At first, these salable\r\narticles had been exclusively vegetable--white and yellow turnip, sweet\r\npotatoes, corn and beans--but later, _meat_!\r\n\r\nYes, meat especially--whole lambs, slaughtered and quartered, the\r\ncoarsest variety of piney-woods pork and beef, all in immense quantity!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _VI._\r\n\r\nIn December of the fatal winter Lee and his wife stopped down at the\r\nLodge for ten days or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nThey were enroute to Cuba at the time, intending to be away five or six\r\nweeks. Their original plan had been only to wait over a day or so in\r\nthe piney-woods, but something caused an amendment to the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe two dallied. Lee seemed to have become vastly absorbed in\r\nsomething--so much absorbed that it was only when Peggy insisted upon\r\ncontinuing their trip, that he could tear himself away.\r\n\r\nIt was during those ten days that he began buying meat. Meager bits\r\nof it at first--a rabbit, a pair of squirrels, or perhaps a few quail\r\nbeyond the number he and Peggy shot. Rori furnished the game, thinking\r\nnothing of it except that Lee paid double prices--and insisted upon\r\nkeeping the purchases secret from other members of the household.\r\n\r\n“I’m putting it across on the Governor, Rori!” he said once with a\r\nwink. “Going to give him the shock of his life. So you mustn’t let\r\non, even to Joe about what I want you to do. Maybe it won’t work out,\r\nbut if it does ...! Dad’ll have the scientific world at his feet! He\r\ndoesn’t blow his own horn anywhere near enough, you know.”\r\n\r\nRori didn’t know. Hadn’t a suspicion what Lee was talking about. Still,\r\nif this rich, young idiot wanted to pay him a half dollar in good\r\nsilver coin for a quail that anyone--himself included--could knock\r\ndown with a five-cent shell, Rori was well satisfied to keep his mouth\r\nshut. Each evening he brought some of the small game. And each day Lee\r\nCranmer seemed to have use for an additional quail or so....\r\n\r\nWhen he was ready to leave for Cuba, Lee came forward with the\r\nstrangest of propositions. He fairly whispered his vehemence and\r\ndesire for secrecy! He would tell Rori, and would pay the Cajan five\r\nhundred dollars--half in advance, and half at the end of five weeks\r\nwhen Lee himself would return from Cuba--provided Rori agreed to adhere\r\nabsolutely to a certain secret program! The money was more than a\r\nfortune to Rori; it was undreamt-of affluence. The Cajan acceded.\r\n\r\n“He wuz tellin’ me then how the ol’ man had raised some kind of pet,”\r\nRori confided, “an’ wanted to get shet of it. So he give it to Lee,\r\ntellin’ him to kill it, but Lee was sot on foolin’ him. W’at I ask yer\r\nis, w’at kind of a pet is it w’at lives down in a mud sink _an’ eats a\r\ncouple hawgs every night_?”\r\n\r\nI couldn’t imagine, so I pressed him for further details. Here at last\r\nwas something which sounded like a clue!\r\n\r\nHe really knew too little. The agreement with Lee provided that if Rori\r\ncarried out the provisions exactly, he should be paid extra and at his\r\nexorbitant scale of all additional outlay, when Lee returned.\r\n\r\nThe young man gave him a daily schedule which Rori showed. Each evening\r\nhe was to procure, slaughter and cut up a definite--and growing--amount\r\nof meat. Every item was checked, and I saw that they ran from five\r\npounds up to _forty_!\r\n\r\n“What in heaven’s name did you do with it?” I demanded, excited now\r\nand pouring him an additional drink for fear caution might return to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Took it through the bushes in back an’ slung it in the mud sink there!\r\nAn’ suthin’ come up an’ drug it down!”\r\n\r\n“A ’gator?”\r\n\r\n“_Diable!_ How should I know? It was dark. I wouldn’t go close.” He\r\nshuddered, and the fingers which lifted his glass shook as with sudden\r\nchill. “Mebbe you’d of done it, huh? Not _me_, though! The young fellah\r\ntole me to sling it in, an’ I slung it.\r\n\r\n“A couple times I come around in the light, but there wasn’t nuthin’\r\nthere you could see. Jes’ mud, an’ some water. Mebbe the thing didn’t\r\ncome out in daytimes....”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” I agreed, straining every mental resource to imagine\r\nwhat Lee’s sinister pet could have been. “But you said something about\r\n_two hogs a day_? What did you mean by that? This paper, proof enough\r\nthat you’re telling the truth so far, states that on the thirty-fifth\r\nday you were to throw forty pounds of meat--any kind--into the sink.\r\nTwo hogs, even the piney-woods variety, weigh a lot more than forty\r\npounds!”\r\n\r\n“Them was after--after he come back!”\r\n\r\nFrom this point onward, Rori’s tale became more and more enmeshed in\r\nthe vagaries induced by bad liquor. His tongue thickened. I shall give\r\nhis story without attempt to reproduce further verbal barbarities,\r\nor the occasional prodding I had to give in order to keep him from\r\nmaundering into foolish jargon.\r\n\r\nLee had paid munificently. His only objection to the manner in which\r\nRori had carried out his orders was that the orders themselves had\r\nbeen deficient. The pet, he said had grown enormously. It was hungry,\r\nravenous. Lee himself had supplemented the fare with huge pails of\r\nscraps from the kitchen.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Lee purchased from Rori whole sheep and hogs! The Cajan\r\ncontinued to bring the carcasses at nightfall, but no longer did Lee\r\npermit him to approach the pool. The young man appeared chronically\r\nexcited now. He had a tremendous secret--one the extent of which even\r\nhis father did not guess, and one which would astonish the world! Only\r\na week or two more and he would spring it. First he would have to\r\narrange certain data.\r\n\r\nThen came the day when everyone disappeared from Dead House. Rori came\r\naround several times, but concluded that all of the occupants had\r\nfolded tents and departed--doubtless taking their mysterious “pet”\r\nalong. Only when he saw from a distance Joe, the octoroon servant,\r\nreturning along the road on foot toward the Lodge, did his slow mental\r\nprocesses begin to ferment. That afternoon Rori visited the strange\r\nplace for the next to last time.\r\n\r\nHe did not go to the Lodge itself--and there were reasons. While still\r\nsome hundreds of yards away from the place a terrible, sustained\r\nscreaming reached his ears! It was faint, yet unmistakably the voice\r\nof Joe! Throwing a pair of number two shells into the breech of his\r\nshotgun, Rori hurried on, taking his usual path through the brush at\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\nHe saw--and as he told me even “shinny” drunkenness fled his chattering\r\ntones--Joe, the octoroon. Aye, he stood in the yard, far from the pool\r\ninto which Rori had thrown the carcasses--_and Joe could not move_!\r\n\r\nRori failed to explain in full, but _something_, a slimy, amorphous\r\nsomething, which glistened in the sunlight, already had engulfed the\r\nman to his shoulders! Breath was cut off. Joe’s contorted face writhed\r\nwith horror and beginning suffocation. One hand--all that was free of\r\nthe rest of him!--beat feebly upon the rubbery, translucent thing that\r\nwas engulfing his body!\r\n\r\nThen Joe sank from sight....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _VII._\r\n\r\nFive days of liquored indulgence passed before Rori, alone in his shaky\r\ncabin, convinced himself that he had seen a phantasy born of alcohol.\r\nHe came back the last time--to find a high wall of brick surrounding\r\nthe Lodge, and including the pool of mud into which he had thrown the\r\nmeat!\r\n\r\nWhile he hesitated, circling the place without discovering an\r\nopening--which he would not have dared to use, even had he found\r\nit--a crashing, tearing of timbers, and persistent sound of awesome\r\ndestruction came from within. He swung himself into one of the oaks\r\nnear the wall. And he was just in time to see the last supporting\r\nstanchions of the Lodge give way _outward_!\r\n\r\nThe whole structure came apart. The roof fell in--yet seemed to move\r\nafter it had fallen! Logs of wall deserted retaining grasp of their\r\nspikes like layers of plywood in the grasp of the shearing machine!\r\n\r\nThat was all. Soddenly intoxicated now, Rori mumbled more phrases,\r\ngiving me the idea that on another day when he became sober once more,\r\nhe might add to his statements, but I--numbed to the soul--scarcely\r\ncared. If that which he related was true, what nightmare of madness\r\nmust have been consummated here!\r\n\r\nI could vision some things now which concerned Lee and Peggy, horrible\r\nthings. Only remembrance of Elsie kept me faced forward in the\r\nsearch--for now it seemed almost that the handiwork of a madman must\r\nbe preferred to what Rori claimed to have seen! What had been that\r\nsinister, translucent thing? That glistening thing which jumped upward\r\nabout a man, smothering, engulfing?\r\n\r\nQueerly enough, though such a theory as came most easily to mind\r\nnow would have outraged reason in me if suggested concerning total\r\nstrangers, I asked myself only what details of Rori’s revelation had\r\nbeen exaggerated by fright and fumes of liquor. And as I sat on the\r\ncreaking bench in his cabin, staring unseeing as he lurched down to the\r\nfloor, fumbling with a lock box of green tin which lay under his cot,\r\nand muttering, the answer to all my questions lay within reach!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not until next day, however, that I made the discovery. Heavy of\r\nheart I had reexamined the spot where the Lodge had stood, then made my\r\nway to the Cajan’s cabin again, seeking sober confirmation of what he\r\nhad told me during intoxication.\r\n\r\nIn imagining that such a spree for Rori would be ended by a single\r\nnight, however, I was mistaken. He lay sprawled almost as I had left\r\nhim. Only two factors were changed. No “shinny” was left--and lying\r\nopen, with its miscellaneous contents strewed about, was the tin box.\r\nRori somehow had managed to open it with the tiny key still clutched in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nConcern for his safety alone was what made me notice the box. It was a\r\nreceptacle for small fishing tackle of the sort carried here and there\r\nby any sportsman. Tangles of Dowagiac minnows, spoon hooks ranging in\r\nsize to silver-backed number eights; three reels still carrying line of\r\ndifferent weights, spinners, casting plugs, wobblers, floating baits,\r\nwere spilled out upon the rough plank flooring where they might snag\r\nRori badly if he rolled. I gathered them, intending to save him an\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nWith the miscellaneous assortment in my hands, however, I stopped dead.\r\nSomething had caught my eye--something lying flush with the bottom of\r\nthe lock box! I stared, and then swiftly tossed the hooks and other\r\nimpedimenta upon the table. What I had glimpsed there in the box was a\r\nloose-leaf notebook of the sort used for recording laboratory data! And\r\nRori scarcely could read, let alone _write_!\r\n\r\nFeverishly, a riot of recognition, surmise, hope and fear bubbling\r\nin my brain, I grabbed the book and threw it open. At once I knew\r\nthat this was the end. The pages were scribbled in pencil, but the\r\nhandwriting was that precise chirography I knew as belonging to John\r\nCorliss Cranmer, the scientist!\r\n\r\n “_ ... Could he not have obeyed my instructions! Oh, God! This...._”\r\n\r\nThese were the words at top of the first page which met my eye.\r\n\r\nBecause knowledge of the circumstances, the relation of which I pried\r\nout of the reluctant Rori only some days later when I had him in\r\nMobile as a police witness for the sake of my friend’s vindication, is\r\nnecessary to understanding, I shall interpolate.\r\n\r\nRori had not told me everything. On his late visit to the vicinage of\r\nDead House he saw more. A crouching figure, seated Turk fashion on top\r\nof the wall, appeared to be writing industriously. Rori recognized the\r\nman as Cranmer, yet did not hail him. He had no opportunity.\r\n\r\nJust as the Cajan came near, Cranmer rose, thrust the notebook, which\r\nhad rested across his knees, into the box. Then he turned, tossed\r\noutside the wall both the locked box and a ribbon to which was attached\r\nthe key.\r\n\r\nThen his arms raised toward heaven. For five seconds he seemed to\r\ninvoke the mercy of Power beyond all of man’s scientific prying. And\r\nfinally he leaped, _inside_ ...!\r\n\r\nRori did not climb to investigate. He knew that directly below this\r\nportion of wall lay the mud sink into which he had thrown the chunks of\r\nmeat!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _VIII._\r\n\r\nThis is a true transcription of the statement I inscribed, telling the\r\nsequence of actual events at Dead House. The original of the statement\r\nnow lies in the archives of the detective department.\r\n\r\nCranmer’s notebook, though written in a precise hand, yet betrayed the\r\nman’s insanity by incoherence and frequent repetitions. My statement\r\nhas been accepted now, both by alienists and by detectives who had\r\nentertained different theories in respect to the case. It quashes the\r\nnoisome hints and suspicions regarding three of the finest Americans\r\nwho ever lived--and also one queer supposition dealing with supposed\r\ncriminal tendencies in poor Joe, the octoroon.\r\n\r\nJohn Corliss Cranmer _went_ insane for sufficient cause!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs readers of popular fiction know well, Lee Cranmer’s _forte_ was\r\nthe writing of what is called--among fellows in the craft--the\r\npseudo-scientific story. In plain words, this means a yarn, based\r\nupon solid fact in the field of astronomy, chemistry, anthropology or\r\nwhatnot, which carries to logical conclusion unproved theories of men\r\nwho devote their lives to searching out further nadirs of fact.\r\n\r\nIn certain fashion these men are allies of science. Often they\r\nvisualize something which has not been imagined even by the best of men\r\nfrom whom they secure data, thus opening new horizons of possibility.\r\nIn a large way Jules Verne was one of these men in his day; Lee Cranmer\r\nbade fair to carry on the work in worthy fashion--work taken up for a\r\nperiod by an Englishman named Wells, but abandoned for stories of a\r\ndifferent--and, in my humble opinion, less absorbing--type.\r\n\r\nLee wrote three novels, all published, which dealt with such\r\nsubjects--two of the three secured from his own father’s labors,\r\nand the other speculating upon the discovery and possible uses of\r\ninteratomic energy. Upon John Corliss Cranmer’s return from Prague that\r\nfatal winter, the father informed Lee that a greater subject than any\r\nwith which the young man had dealt, now could be tapped.\r\n\r\nCranmer, senior, had devised a way in which the limiting factors in\r\nprotozoic life and _growth_, could be nullified; in time, and with\r\ncooperation of biologists who specialized upon _karyokinesis_ and\r\nembryology of higher forms, he hoped--to put the theory in pragmatic\r\nterms--to be able to grow swine the size of elephants, quail or\r\nwoodcock with breasts from which a hundredweight of white meat could be\r\ncut away, and steers whose dehorned heads might butt at the third story\r\nof a skyscraper!\r\n\r\nSuch result would revolutionize the methods of food supply, of\r\ncourse. It also would hold out hope for all undersized specimens of\r\nhumanity--provided only that if factors inhibiting growth could be\r\ndeleted, some method of stopping gianthood also could be developed.\r\n\r\nCranmer the elder, through use of an undescribed (in the notebook)\r\ngrowth medium of which one constituent was _agar-agar_, and the use\r\nof radium emanations, had succeeded in bringing about apparently\r\nunrestricted growth in the paramœcium protozoan, certain of the\r\nvegetable growths (among which were bacteria), and in the amorphous\r\ncell of protoplasm known as the amœba--the last a single cell\r\ncontaining only neucleolus, neucleus, and a space known as the\r\ncontractile vacuole which somehow aided in throwing off particles\r\nimpossible to assimilate directly. This point may be remembered in\r\nrespect to the piles of lumber left near the outside walls surrounding\r\nDead House!\r\n\r\nWhen Lee Cranmer and his wife came south to visit, John Corliss Cranmer\r\nshowed his son an amœba--normally an organism visible under low-power\r\nmicroscope--which he had absolved from natural growth inhibitions. This\r\namœba, a rubbery, amorphous mass of protoplasm, was of the size then of\r\na large beef liver. It could have been held in two cupped hands, placed\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n“How large could it grow?” asked Lee, wide-eyed and interested.\r\n\r\n“So far as I know,” answered the father, “there is _no_ limit--now! It\r\nmight, if it got food enough, grow to be as big as the Masonic Temple!\r\n\r\n“But take it out and kill it. Destroy the organism utterly--burning the\r\nfragment--else there is no telling what might happen. The amœba, as I\r\nhave explained, reproduces by simple division. Any fragment remaining\r\nmight be dangerous.”\r\n\r\nLee took the rubbery, translucent giant cell--but he did not obey\r\norders. Instead of destroying it as his father had directed, Lee\r\nthought out a plan. Suppose he should grow this organism to tremendous\r\nsize? Suppose, when the tale of his father’s accomplishment were\r\nspread, an amœba of many tons weight could be shown in evidence?\r\nLee, of somewhat sensational cast of mind, determined instantly to\r\nkeep secret the fact that he was not destroying the organism, but\r\nencouraging its further growth. Thought of possible peril never crossed\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nHe arranged to have the thing fed--allowing for normal increase of size\r\nin an abnormal thing. It fooled him only in growing much more rapidly.\r\nWhen he came back from Cuba the amœba practically filled the whole of\r\nthe mud sink hollow. He had to give it much greater supplies....\r\n\r\nThe giant cell came to absorb as much as two hogs in a single day.\r\nDuring daylight, while hunger still was appeased, it never emerged,\r\nhowever. That remained for the time that it could secure no more food\r\nnear at hand to satisfy its ravenous and increasing appetite.\r\n\r\nOnly instinct for the sensational kept Lee from telling Peggy, his\r\nwife, all about the matter. Lee hoped to spring a _coup_ which would\r\nimmortalize his father, and surprise his wife terrifically. Therefore,\r\nhe kept his own counsel--and made bargains with the Cajan, Rori, who\r\nsupplied food daily for the shapeless monster of the pool.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy itself came suddenly and unexpectedly. Peggy, feeding the\r\ntwo Gordon setters that Lee and she used for quail hunting, was in the\r\nLodge yard before sunset. She romped alone, as Lee himself was dressing.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden her screams cut the still air! Without her knowledge,\r\nten-foot _pseudopods_--those flowing tentacles of protoplasm sent forth\r\nby the sinister occupant of the pool--slid out and around her putteed\r\nankles.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she did not understand. Then, at first suspicion of the\r\nhorrid truth, her cries rent the air. Lee, at that time struggling to\r\nlace a pair of high shoes, straightened, paled, and grabbed a revolver\r\nas he dashed out.\r\n\r\nIn another room a scientist, absorbed in his note-taking, glanced up,\r\nfrowned, and then--recognizing the voice--shed his white gown and came\r\nout. He was too late to do aught but gasp with horror.\r\n\r\nIn the yard Peggy was half engulfed in a squamous, rubbery something\r\nwhich at first glance he could not analyze.\r\n\r\nLee, his boy, was fighting with the sticky folds, and slowly, surely,\r\nlosing his own grip upon the earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IX._\r\n\r\nJohn Corliss Cranmer was by no means a coward. He stared, cried aloud,\r\nthen ran indoors, seizing the first two weapons which came to hand--a\r\nshotgun and hunting knife which lay in sheath in a cartridged belt\r\nacross a hook of the hall-tree. The knife was ten inches in length and\r\nrazor keen.\r\n\r\nCranmer rushed out again. He saw an indecent fluid something--which\r\nas yet he had not had time to classify--lumping itself into a\r\nsix-foot-high center before his very eyes! It looked like one of the\r\nmicro-organisms he had studied! One grown to frightful dimensions. An\r\namœba!\r\n\r\nThere, some minutes suffocated in the rubbery folds--yet still apparent\r\nbeneath the glistening ooze of this monster--were two bodies.\r\n\r\nThey were dead. He knew it. Nevertheless he attacked the flowing,\r\nsenseless monster with his knife. Shot would do no good. And he found\r\nthat even the deep, terrific slashes made by his knife closed together\r\nin a moment and healed. The monster was invulnerable to ordinary attack!\r\n\r\nA pair of _pseudopods_ sought out his ankles, attempting to bring\r\nhim low. Both of these he severed--and escaped. Why did he try? He\r\ndid not know. The two whom he had sought to rescue were dead, buried\r\nunder folds of this horrid thing he knew to be his own discovery and\r\nfabrication.\r\n\r\nThen it was that revulsion and insanity came upon him.\r\n\r\nThere ended the story of John Corliss Cranmer, save for one hastily\r\nscribbled paragraph--evidently written at the time Rori had seen him\r\natop the wall.\r\n\r\nMay we not supply with assurance the intervening steps?\r\n\r\nCranmer was known to have purchased a whole pen of hogs a day or two\r\nfollowing the tragedy. These animals never were seen again. During the\r\ntime the wall was being constructed is it not reasonable to assume\r\nthat he fed the giant organism within--to keep it quiet? His scientist\r\nbrain must have visualized clearly the havoc and horror which could be\r\nwrought by the loathsome thing if it ever were driven by hunger to flow\r\naway from the Lodge and prey upon the countryside!\r\n\r\nWith the wall once in place, he evidently figured that starvation or\r\nsome other means which he could supply would kill the thing. One of the\r\nmeans had been made by setting fire to several piles of the disgorged\r\ntimbers; probably this had no effect whatever.\r\n\r\nThe amœba was to accomplish still more destruction. In the throes of\r\nhunger it threw its gigantic, formless strength against the house walls\r\n_from the inside_; then every edible morsel within was assimilated,\r\nthe logs, rafters and other fragments being worked out through the\r\ncontractile _vacuole_.\r\n\r\nDuring some of its last struggles, undoubtedly, the side wall of brick\r\nwas weakened--not to collapse, however, until the giant amœba no longer\r\ncould take advantage of the breach.\r\n\r\nIn final death lassitude, the amœba stretched itself out in a thin\r\nlayer over the ground. There it succumbed, though there is no means of\r\nestimating how long a time intervened.\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph in Cranmer’s notebook, scrawled so badly that it is\r\npossible some words I have not deciphered correctly, read as follows:\r\n\r\n “_In my work I have found the means of creating a monster. The\r\n unnatural thing, in turn, has destroyed my work and those whom I held\r\n dear. It is in vain that I assure myself of innocence of spirit. Mine\r\n is the crime of presumption. Now, as expiation--worthless though that\r\n may be--I give myself...._”\r\n\r\nIt is better not to think of that last leap, and the struggle of an\r\ninsane man in the grip of the dying monster.\r\n\r\n                           [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Extraordinary, Unearthly Things\r\n  Will Thrill and Amaze You\r\n  In This Strange Story_\r\n\r\n                             _The_ Thing\r\n                                _of a_\r\n                               Thousand\r\n                                Shapes\r\n\r\n                       _By_ OTIS ADELBERT KLINE\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Jim was dead.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely believe it, but the little yellow missive, which had\r\njust been handed to me by the Western Union messenger boy, left no room\r\nfor doubt. It was short and convincing:\r\n\r\n “_Come to Peoria at once. James Braddock dead of heart failure._\r\n\r\n  _Corbin & His. Attorneys._”\r\n\r\nI should explain here that Uncle Jim, my mother’s brother, was my\r\nonly living near relative. Having lost both father and mother in the\r\nIroquois Theatre Fire at the age of twelve years, I should have been\r\nforced to abandon my plans for a high school and commercial education\r\nbut for his noble generosity. In his home town he was believed to be\r\ncomfortably well off, but I had learned not long since that it had\r\nmeant a considerable sacrifice for him to furnish the fifteen hundred\r\ndollars a year to put me through high school and business college,\r\nand I was glad when the time came for me to find employment, and thus\r\nbecome independent of his bounty.\r\n\r\nMy position as bookkeeper for a commission firm in South Water Street,\r\nwhile not particularly remunerative, at least provided a comfortable\r\nliving, and I was happy in it--until the message of his death came.\r\n\r\nI took the telegram to my employer, obtained a week’s leave-of-absence,\r\nand was soon on the way to the Union Depot.\r\n\r\nAll the way to Peoria I thought about Uncle Jim. He was not old--only\r\nforty-five--and when I had last seen him he had seemed particularly\r\nhale and hearty. This sudden loss of my nearest and dearest friend was,\r\ntherefore, almost unbelievable. I carried a leaden weight in my heart,\r\nand it seemed that the lump in my throat would choke me.\r\n\r\nUncle Jim had lived on a three-hundred-and-twenty acre farm near\r\nPeoria. Being a bachelor, he had employed a housekeeper. The farm work\r\nwas looked after by a family named Severs--man, wife and two sons--who\r\nlived in the tenant house, perhaps a thousand feet to the rear of the\r\nowner’s residence, in convenient proximity to the barn, silos and other\r\nfarm buildings.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, my uncle’s neighbors believed him to be comfortably\r\nwell off, but I knew the place was mortgaged to the limit, so that the\r\nincome from the fertile acres was practically absorbed by overhead\r\nexpenses and interest.\r\n\r\nHad my uncle been a business man in the true sense of the term, no\r\ndoubt he could have been wealthy. But he was a scientist and dreamer,\r\ninclined to let the farm run itself while he devoted his time to study\r\nand research. His hobby was psychic phenomena. His thirst for more\r\nfacts regarding the human mind was insatiable. In the pursuit of his\r\nfavorite study, he had attended seances in this country and abroad with\r\nthe leading spiritualists of the world.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the London Society for Psychical Research, as\r\nwell as the American Society, and corresponded regularly with noted\r\nscientists, psychologists and spiritualists. As an authority on psychic\r\nphenomena, he had contributed articles to the leading scientific\r\npublications from time to time, and was the author of a dozen\r\nwell-known books on the subject.\r\n\r\nThus, grief-filled though I was, my mind kept presenting to me memory\r\nafter memory of Uncle Jim’s scientific attainments and scholarly life,\r\nwhile the rumbling car wheels left the miles behind; and the thought\r\nthat such a man had been lost to me and to the world was almost\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Peoria shortly before midnight, and was glad to find Joe\r\nSevers, son of my uncle’s tenant, waiting for me with a flivver. After\r\na five-mile ride in inky darkness over a rough road, we came to the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nI was greeted at the door by the housekeeper, Mrs. Rhodes, and one\r\nof two men, nearby neighbors, who had kindly volunteered to “set up”\r\nwith the corpse. The woman’s eyes were red with weeping, and her tears\r\nflowed afresh as she led me to the room where my uncle’s body lay in a\r\ngray casket.\r\n\r\nA dim kerosene lamp burned in one corner of the room, and after the\r\nsilent watcher had greeted me with a handclasp and a sad shake of the\r\nhead, I walked up to view the remains of my dearest friend on earth.\r\n\r\nAs I looked down on that noble, kindly face, the old lump, which\r\nhad for a time subsided, came back in my throat. I expected tears,\r\nheartrending sobs, but they did not come. I seemed dazed--bewildered.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, and apparently against my own reason, I heard myself saying\r\naloud, “He is not dead--only sleeping.”\r\n\r\nWhen the watchers looked at me in amazement I repeated, “Uncle Jim is\r\n_not dead_! He is only sleeping.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rhodes looked compassionately at me, and by a meaning glance at\r\nthe others said as plainly as if she had spoken, “His mind is affected.”\r\n\r\nShe and Mr. Newberry, the neighbor whom I had first met, gently led me\r\nfrom the room. I was, myself dumfounded at the words I had uttered, nor\r\ncould I find a reason for them.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was undoubtedly dead, at least as far as this physical\r\nworld was concerned. There was nothing about the appearance of the\r\npale, rigid corpse to indicate life, and he had, without doubt, been\r\npronounced dead by a physician. Why, then, had I made this unusual,\r\nuncalled for--in fact, ridiculous--statement? I did not know. I\r\nconcluded that I must have been crazed with grief--beside myself for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nI had announced my intention to keep watch with Mr. Newberry and the\r\nother neighbor, Mr. Glitch, but was finally prevailed upon to go to my\r\nroom, on the ground that my nerves were overwrought and I must have\r\nrest. It was decided, therefore, that the housekeeper, who had scarcely\r\nslept a wink the night before, and I should retire, while the two\r\nneighbors alternately kept two-hour watches, one sitting up while the\r\nother slept on a davenport near the fireplace.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rhodes conducted me to my room. I quickly undressed, blew out\r\nthe kerosene light and got into bed. It was some time before I could\r\ncompose myself for sleep, and I remember that just as I was dozing off\r\nI seemed to hear my name pronounced as if someone were calling me from\r\na great distance:\r\n\r\n“Billy!” and then, in the same far-away voice: “_Save me, Billy!_”\r\n\r\nI had slept for perhaps fifteen minutes when I awoke with a start.\r\nEither I was dreaming, or something about the size and shape of a\r\nhalf-grown conger eel was creeping across my bed.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I was frozen with horror, as I perceived the white,\r\nnameless thing, in the dim light from my window. With a convulsive\r\nmovement I threw the bedclothes from me, leaped to the floor, struck a\r\nmatch, and quickly lit the lamp. Then, taking my heavy walking-stick in\r\nhand, I advanced on the bed.\r\n\r\nMoving the bedclothing cautiously with the stick and prodding here and\r\nthere, I at length discovered that the thing was gone. The door was\r\nclosed, there was no transom, and the window was screened. I therefore\r\nconcluded that it must still be in the room.\r\n\r\nWith this thought in mind, I carefully searched every inch of space,\r\nlooking under and behind the furniture, with the lamp in one hand and\r\nstick in the other. I then removed all the bedding and opened the\r\ndresser drawers, and found--nothing!\r\n\r\nAfter completely satisfying myself that the animal I had seen, or\r\nperhaps seemed to see, could not possibly be in the room, I decided\r\nthat I had been suffering from a nightmare, and again retired. Because\r\nof my nervousness from the experience, I did not again blow out the\r\nlight, but instead turned it low.\r\n\r\nAfter a half hour of restless turning and tossing, I succeeded in\r\ngoing to sleep; this time for possibly twenty minutes, when I was once\r\nmore aroused. The same feeling of horror came over me, as I distinctly\r\nheard a rolling, scraping sound beneath my bed. I kept perfectly still\r\nand waited while the sound went on. Something was apparently creeping\r\nunderneath my bed, and it seemed to be moving toward the foot, slowly\r\nand laboriously.\r\n\r\nStealthily I sat up, leaned forward and peered over the foot-board.\r\nThe sounds grew more distinct, and a white, round mass, which looked\r\nlike a porcupine rolled into a ball with bristles projecting, emerged\r\nfrom under my bed. I uttered a choking cry of fright, and the thing\r\n_disappeared before my eyes_!\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to search the room further, I leaped from the bed to\r\nthe spot nearest the door, wrenched it open, and started on a run\r\nfor the living-room, attired only in pajamas. As I neared the room,\r\nhowever, part of my lost courage came back to me, and I slowed down\r\nto a walk. I reasoned that a precipitate entrance into the room would\r\narouse the household, and that possibly, after all, I was only the\r\nvictim of a second nightmare. I resolved, therefore, to say nothing\r\nto the watchers about my experience, but to tell them only that I was\r\nunable to sleep and had come down for company.\r\n\r\nNewberry met me at the door.\r\n\r\n“Why what’s the matter?” he asked. “You look pale. Anything wrong?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing but a slight attack of indigestion. Couldn’t sleep, so I came\r\ndown for company.”\r\n\r\n“You should have brought a dressing-gown or something. You may take\r\ncold.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I feel quite comfortable enough,” I said.\r\n\r\nNewberry stirred the logs in the fireplace to a blaze, and we moved\r\nour chairs close to the flickering circle of warmth. The dim light was\r\nstill burning in the corner of the room, and Glitch was snoring on the\r\ndavenport.\r\n\r\n“Funny thing,” said Newberry, “the instructions your uncle left.”\r\n\r\n“Instructions? What instructions?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, didn’t you know? But of course you didn’t. He left written\r\ninstructions with Mrs. Rhodes that in case of his sudden death his\r\nbody was not to be embalmed, packed in ice, or preserved in any way,\r\nand that it was not to be buried under any consideration, until\r\ndecomposition had set in. He also ordered that no autopsy should be\r\nheld until it had been definitely decided that putrefaction had taken\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“Have these instructions been carried out?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“To the letter,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“And how long will it take for putrefaction to set in?”\r\n\r\n“The doctors say it will probably be noticed in twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\nI reflected on this strange order of my uncle’s. It seemed to me that\r\nhe must have feared being buried alive, or something of the sort, and\r\nI recalled several instances, of which I had heard, where bodies, upon\r\nbeing exhumed, were found turned over in their coffins, while others\r\nhad apparently torn their hair and clawed the lid in their efforts to\r\nescape from a living tomb.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to feel sleepy again and had just started to doze, when\r\nNewberry grasped my arm.\r\n\r\n“Look!” he exclaimed, pointing toward the body.\r\n\r\nI looked quickly and seemed to see something white for an instant, near\r\nthe nostrils.\r\n\r\n“Did you see it?” he asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“See what?” I replied, wishing to learn if he had seen the same thing I\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n“I saw something white, like a thick vapor or filmy veil, come out of\r\nhis nose. When I spoke to you it seemed to jerk back. Didn’t you see\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Thought I saw a white flash there when you spoke, but it must have\r\nbeen imagination.”\r\n\r\nThe time had now arrived for Glitch to watch, so my companion wakened\r\nhim, and they exchanged places. Newberry was soon asleep, and Glitch,\r\nbeing a stoical German, said little. I presently became drowsy, and was\r\nasleep in my chair in a short time.\r\n\r\nA cry from Glitch brought me to my feet. “Vake up and help catch der\r\ncat!”\r\n\r\n“What cat?” demanded Newberry, also awakening.\r\n\r\n“Der big vite cat,” said Glitch, visibly excited. “Chust now he came\r\nder door through and yumped der coffin in.”\r\n\r\nThe three of us rushed to the coffin, but there was no sign of a cat,\r\nand everything seemed undisturbed.\r\n\r\n“Dot’s funny,” said Glitch. “Maybe it’s hiding someveres in der room.”\r\n\r\nWe searched the room, without result.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been seeing things,” said Newberry.\r\n\r\n“What did the animal look like?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Vite, und big as a dog. It kommt der door in, so, und galloped across\r\nder floor, so, und yumped in der casket chust like dot. _Ach!_ It vos a\r\nfierce-looking beast.”\r\n\r\nGlitch was very much in earnest and gesticulated rapidly as he\r\ndescribed the appearance and movements of the feline. Perhaps I should\r\nhave felt inclined to laugh, had it not been for my own experience that\r\nnight. I noticed, too, that Newberry’s expression was anything but\r\njocular.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly four o’clock, time for Newberry to watch, but Glitch\r\nprotested that he could not sleep another wink, so the three of us drew\r\nchairs up close to the fire. On each side of the fireplace was a large\r\nwindow. The shades were completely drawn and the windows were draped\r\nwith heavy lace curtains. Happening to look up at the window to the\r\nleft, I noticed something of a mouse-gray color hanging near the top of\r\none of the curtains. As I looked, I fancied I saw a slight movement as\r\nof a wing being stretched a bit and then folded, and the thing took on\r\nthe appearance of a large vampire bat, hanging upside down.\r\n\r\nI called the attention of my companions to our singular visitor, and\r\nboth saw it as plainly as I.\r\n\r\n“How do you suppose he got in?” asked Newberry.\r\n\r\n“Funny ve didn’t see him before,” said Glitch.\r\n\r\nI picked up the fire tongs and Newberry seized the poker. Creeping\r\nsoftly up to the curtain, I stood on tiptoe and reached up to seize the\r\nanimal with the tongs. It was too quick for me, however, and fluttered\r\nout of my reach. There followed a chase around the room, which lasted\r\nseveral minutes. Seeing that it would be impossible for us to capture\r\nthe creature by this method, we gave up the chase, whereupon it calmed\r\ndown and suspended itself from the picture molding, upside down.\r\n\r\nOn seeing this, Glitch, who had taken a heavy book from the table,\r\nhurled it at our unwelcome visitor. His aim was good, and the thing\r\nuttered a _squeak_ as it was crushed against the wall.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I thought I heard a moan from the direction of the\r\ncasket, but could not be certain.\r\n\r\nNewberry and I rushed over to where the book had fallen, intent on\r\ndispatching the thing with poker and tongs, but only the book lay on\r\nthe floor. The creature had _completely disappeared_.\r\n\r\nI picked up the book, and noticed, as I did so, a grayish smear on the\r\nback cover. Taking this over to the light, we saw that it had a soapy\r\nappearance. As we looked, the substance apparently became absorbed,\r\neither by the atmosphere or into the cloth cover of the book. There\r\nremained, however, a dry, white, faintly-defined splotch on the book\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of it?” I asked them.\r\n\r\n“Strange!” said Newberry.\r\n\r\nI turned to Glitch, and noticed for the first time that his eyes were\r\nwide with fear. He shook his head and cast furtive glances toward the\r\ncasket.\r\n\r\n“What do _you_ think it is?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“A vampire, maybe. A _real_ vampire.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by a real vampire?”\r\n\r\nGlitch then described how, in the folk lore of his native land, there\r\nwere stories current of corpses which lived on in the grave. It was\r\nbelieved that the spirits of these corpses assumed the form of huge\r\nvampire bats at night, and went about sucking the blood of living\r\npersons, with which they would return to the grave from time to time\r\nand nourish the corpse. This proceeding was kept up indefinitely,\r\nunless the corpse were exhumed and a stake driven through the heart.\r\n\r\nHe related, in particular, the story of a Hungarian named Arnold Paul,\r\nwhose body was dug up after it had been buried forty days. It was found\r\nthat his cheeks were flushed with blood, and that his hair, beard and\r\nnails had grown in the grave. When the stake was driven through his\r\nheart, he had uttered a frightful shriek and a torrent of blood gushed\r\nfrom his mouth.\r\n\r\nThis vampire story seized on my imagination in a peculiar way. I\r\nthought again of my uncle’s strange request regarding the disposition\r\nof his body, and of the strange apparitions I had seen. For the moment\r\nI was a convert to the vampire theory.\r\n\r\nMy better judgment, however, soon convinced me that there could not\r\nbe such a thing as a vampire, and, even if there were, a man whose\r\ncharacter had been so noble as that of my deceased uncle would most\r\ncertainly never resort to such hideous and revolting practices.\r\n\r\nWe sat together in silence as the first faint streaks of dawn showed in\r\nthe east. A few minutes later the welcome aroma of coffee and frying\r\nbacon greeted our nostrils, and Mrs. Rhodes came in to announce that\r\nbreakfast was ready.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, my newly-made friends departed for their homes, both\r\nassuring me that they would be glad to come and watch with me again\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nHowever, I read something in the uneasy manner of Glitch which led me\r\nto believe that I could not count on him, and I was, therefore, not\r\ngreatly surprised when he telephoned me an hour later, stating that his\r\nwife was ill, and that he would not be able to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\nI strolled outdoors to enjoy a cigar, comforted by the rays of the\r\nmorning sun after my night’s experience.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant, I reflected, to be once more in the realm of the\r\nnatural, to see the trees attired in the autumn foliage, to feel the\r\nrustle of fallen leaves underfoot, to fill my lungs with the spicy,\r\ninvigorating October air.\r\n\r\nA gray squirrel scampered across my pathway, his cheek pouches bulging\r\nwith acorns. A flock of blackbirds, migrating southward, stopped for a\r\nfew moments in the trees above my head, chattering vociferously; then\r\nresumed their journey with a sudden _whirr_ of wings and a few hoarse\r\nnotes of farewell.\r\n\r\n“It is but a step,” I reflected, “from the natural to the supernatural.”\r\n\r\nThis observation started a new line of thought. After all, could\r\nanything be supernatural--above nature? Nature, according to my belief,\r\nwas only another name for God, eternal mind, omnipotent, omnipresent,\r\nomniscient ruler of the universe. If He were omnipotent, could anything\r\ntake place contrary to His laws? Obviously not.\r\n\r\nThe word “supernatural” was, after all, only an expression invented\r\nby man in his finite ignorance, to define those things which he did\r\nnot understand. Telegraphy, telephony, the phonograph, the moving\r\npicture--all would have been regarded with superstition by an age less\r\nadvanced than ours. Man had only to become familiar with the laws\r\ngoverning them, in order to discard the word “supernatural” as applied\r\nto their manifestations.\r\n\r\nWhat right, then, had I to term the phenomena, which I had just\r\nwitnessed, supernatural? I might call them supernormal, but to think of\r\nthem as supernatural would be to believe the impossible; namely, that\r\nthat which is all-powerful had been overpowered.\r\n\r\nI resolved, then and there, that if further phenomena manifested\r\nthemselves that night, I would, as far as it were possible, curb my\r\nsuperstition and fear, regard them with the eye of a philosopher, and\r\nendeavor to learn their cause, which must necessarily be governed by\r\nnatural law.\r\n\r\nA gray cloud of dust and the whirring of a motor announced the coming\r\nof an automobile. The next minute an ancient flivver, with whose\r\nbumps of eccentricity I had gained some acquaintance, turned into the\r\ndriveway and stopped opposite me. Joe Severs, older son of my uncle’s\r\ntenant, stepped out and came running toward me.\r\n\r\n“Glitch’s wife died this morning,” he panted, “and he swears Mr.\r\nBraddock is a vampire and sucked her blood.”\r\n\r\n“What rot!” I replied. “Nobody believes him, of course?”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t so sure of that,” said Joe. “Some of the farmers are takin’\r\nit mighty serious. One of the Langdon boys, first farm north of here,\r\nwas took sick this mornin’. Doctor don’t know what’s the matter of him.\r\nFolks say it looks mighty queer.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rhodes appeared on the front porch.\r\n\r\n“A telephone call for you, sir,” she said.\r\n\r\nI hastened to the ’phone. A woman was speaking.\r\n\r\n“This is Mrs. Newberry,” she said. “My husband is dreadfully ill, and\r\nasked me to tell you that he cannot come to sit up with you tonight.”\r\n\r\nI thanked the lady, offered my condolences, and tendered my sincere\r\nwishes for her husband’s speedy recovery. This done, I wrote a note of\r\nsympathy to Mr. Glitch, and dispatched Joe with it.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, was a pretty situation. Glitch’s wife dead, Newberry\r\nseriously ill, and the whole countryside frightened by this impossible\r\nvampire story! I knew it would be useless to ask any of the other\r\nneighbors to keep watch with me. Obviously, I was destined to face the\r\nterrors of the coming night alone. Was I equal to the task? Could my\r\nnerves, already unstrung by the previous night’s experience, withstand\r\nthe ordeal?\r\n\r\nI must confess, and not without a feeling of shame, that at this\r\njuncture I felt impelled to flee, anywhere, and leave my deceased\r\nuncle’s affairs to shape themselves as they would.\r\n\r\nWith this idea in mind, I repaired to my room and started to pack my\r\ngrip. Something fell to the floor. It was my uncle’s last letter,\r\nreceived only the day before the telegram arrived announcing his death.\r\nI hesitated--then picked it up and opened it. The last paragraph held\r\nmy attention:\r\n\r\n “And, Billy, my boy, don’t worry any more about the money I advanced\r\n you. It was, as you say, a considerable drain on my resources, but I\r\n gave it willingly, gladly, for the education of my sister’s son. My\r\n only regret is that I could not have done more.\r\n\r\n  Affectionately,\r\n\r\n  Uncle Jim.”\r\n\r\nA flush of guilt came over me. The reproach of my conscience was keen\r\nand painful. I had been about to commit a cowardly, dishonorable deed.\r\n\r\n“Thank God, for the accidental intervention of that letter,” I said\r\nfervently.\r\n\r\nMy resolution was firmly made now. I would see the thing through at all\r\ncosts. The noble love, the generous self-sacrifice of my uncle, should\r\nnot go unrequited.\r\n\r\nI quickly unpacked my bag and walked downstairs. The rest of the day\r\nwas uneventful, but the night--how I dreaded the coming of the night!\r\nAs I stood on the porch and watched the last faint glow of sunset\r\nslowly fading, I wished that I, like Joshua, might cause the sun and\r\nmoon to stand still.\r\n\r\nTwilight came on all too quickly, accelerated by a bank of heavy clouds\r\nwhich appeared on the western horizon; and darkness succeeded twilight\r\nwith unwonted rapidity.\r\n\r\nI entered the house and trod the hallway leading to the living-room,\r\nwith much the same feeling, no doubt, that a convict experiences when\r\nentering the death cell.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper was just placing the lamp, freshly cleaned and filled,\r\nin the room. Joe Severs’ younger brother, Sam, had placed logs in\r\nthe fireplace, with kindling and paper beneath them, ready for\r\nlighting. Mrs. Rhodes bade me a kindly “Good-night, sir,” and departed\r\nnoiselessly.\r\n\r\nAt last the dreaded moment had arrived. I was alone with the nameless\r\npowers of darkness.\r\n\r\nI shuddered involuntarily. A damp chill pervaded the air, and I ignited\r\nthe kindling beneath the logs in the fireplace. Then, drawing the\r\nshades to shut out the pitchy blackness of the night, I lighted my pipe\r\nand stood in the warm glow.\r\n\r\nUnder the genial influence of pipe and warmth, my feeling of fear was\r\ntemporarily dissipated. Taking a book from the library table, I settled\r\ndown to read. It was called “The Reality of Materialization Phenomena,”\r\nand had been written by my uncle. The publishers were Bulwer & Sons,\r\nNew York and London.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently a record of the observations made by my uncle at\r\nmaterialization seances in this country and Europe. Contrary to my\r\nusual custom on starting a book, I read the author’s introduction. He\r\nbegan by expressing the wish that those who might read the work should\r\nfirst lay aside all prejudice and all preconceived ideas regarding the\r\nsubject, which were not based on positive knowledge; then weigh the\r\nfacts as he had found them before drawing a definite conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe following passage, in particular, held my attention:\r\n\r\n “While it is to be admitted, with regret, that there are many people\r\n calling themselves mediums, who deceive their sitters nightly and\r\n whose productions are consequently mere optical illusions, produced\r\n by chicanery and legerdemain, the writer has nevertheless gathered,\r\n at the sittings recorded in this book, where all possibility of fraud\r\n was excluded by rigorous examination and control, undeniable evidence\r\n that genuine materializations are, and can be, produced.\r\n\r\n “The source and physical composition--if indeed it be physical--of a\r\n phantasm materialized by a true medium, remains, up to the present\r\n time, inexplicable. That such manifestations are not hallucinations,\r\n has been proved time and again by taking photographs. One would indeed\r\n be compelled to strain his credulity to the utmost, were he to believe\r\n that a mere hallucination could be photographed.\r\n\r\n “As I have stated, the exact nature and source of the phenomena\r\n are apparently inscrutable; however, it is a notable fact that the\r\n strongest manifestations take place when the medium is in a state\r\n of catalepsy, or suspended animation. Her hands are cold--her body\r\n becomes rigid--her eyes, if open, appear to be fixed on space--”\r\n\r\nA roll of thunder, quickly followed by a rush of wind, rudely\r\ninterrupted my reading. The housekeeper appeared in the doorway, lamp\r\nin hand.\r\n\r\n“Would you mind helping me close the windows, sir?” she asked. “There\r\nis a big rainstorm coming, and they must be closed quickly, or the\r\nfurnishings and wall paper will be soaked.”\r\n\r\nTogether we ascended the stairs. I rushed from window to window, while\r\nshe lighted the way with the dim lamp. This duty attended to, she again\r\nbade me “Good-night,” and I returned to the living-room.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, I glanced at the casket; then looked again while a\r\nfeeling of horror crept over me. Either I was dreaming, or it had been\r\ncompletely draped with a white sheet during my absence.\r\n\r\nI rubbed my eyes, pinched myself, and advanced to confirm the evidence\r\nof my eyesight by the sense of touch. As I extended my hand, the center\r\nof the sheet rose in a sharp peak, as if lifted by some invisible\r\npresence, and the entire fabric traveled upward toward the ceiling.\r\nI drew back with a cry of dread, watching it with perhaps the same\r\nfascination that is experienced by a doomed bird or animal looking into\r\nthe eyes of a serpent that is about to devour it.\r\n\r\nThe point touched the ceiling. There was a crash of thunder,\r\naccompanied by a blinding flash of lightning which illuminated the room\r\nthrough the sides of the ill-fitting window shades, and I found myself\r\nstaring at the bare ceiling.\r\n\r\nWalking dazedly to the fireplace, I poked the logs until they blazed,\r\nand then sat down to collect my thoughts. Torrents of rain were\r\nbeating against the window panes. Thunder roared and lightning flashed\r\nincessantly.\r\n\r\nI took up my pipe and was about to light it when a strange sight\r\ninterrupted me. Something round and flat, about six inches in diameter,\r\nand of a grayish color, was moving along the floor from the casket\r\ntoward the center of the room. I watched it, fascinated, while the\r\nblood seemed to congeal in my veins. It did not roll or slide along the\r\nfloor, but seemed rather to _flow_ forward.\r\n\r\nIt reminded me, more than anything else, of an amœba, one of those\r\nmicroscopic, unicellular animalcule which I had examined in the study\r\nof zoology: an amœba magnified, perhaps, several million diameters. I\r\ncould plainly see it put forth projections, resembling pseudopods, from\r\ntime to time, and again withdraw them quickly into the body mass.\r\n\r\nThe lighted match burned my fingers, and I dropped it on the hearth.\r\nIn the meantime the creature had reached the center of the room and\r\nstopped. A metamorphosis was now taking place before my eyes. To\r\nmy surprise, I beheld, in place of a magnified amœba, a gigantic\r\ntrilobite, larger, it is true, than any specimen which has ever been\r\nfound, but, nevertheless, true to form in every detail.\r\n\r\nThe trilobite, in turn, changed to a brilliantly-hued star-fish with\r\nactive, wriggling tentacles. The star-fish became a crab, and the crab,\r\na porpoise swimming about in the air as if it had been water. The\r\nporpoise then became a huge green lizard that crawled about the floor.\r\n\r\nSoon the lizard grew large webbed wings, its tail shortened, its\r\njaws lengthened out with a pelicanlike pouch beneath them, and its\r\nbody seemed partially covered with scales of a rusty black color.\r\nI afterward learned that this was a phantasmic representation of a\r\npterodactyl, or prehistoric flying reptile. To me, in my terrified\r\ncondition, it looked like a creature from hell.\r\n\r\nThe thing stood erect, stretched its wings and beat the air as if to\r\ntry them; then rose and circled twice about the room, flapping lazily\r\nlike a heron, and once more alighted in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nIt folded its wings carefully, and I noticed many new changes taking\r\nplace. The scales were becoming feathers--the legs lengthened out and\r\nwere encased in a thick, scaly skin. The claws thickened into two-toed\r\nfeet, like those of an ostrich. The head also looked ostrich-like,\r\nwhile the wings were shortened and feathered, but not plumed. The bird\r\nwas much larger than any ostrich or emu I have ever seen, and stalked\r\nabout majestically, its head nearly touching the ceiling.\r\n\r\nSoon it, too, stopped in the center of the room--the neck grew shorter\r\nand shorter--the feathers became fur--the wings lengthened into arms\r\nwhich reached below the knees, and I was face to face with a huge,\r\ngorilla-like creature. It roared horribly, casting quick glances about\r\nthe room, its deep-set eyes glowing like coals of fire.\r\n\r\nI felt that my end had come, but could make no move to escape. I wanted\r\nto get up and leap through the window, but my nerveless limbs would\r\nnot function. As I looked, the fur on the creature turned to a thin\r\ncovering of hair, and it began to assume a manlike form. I closed my\r\neyes and shuddered.\r\n\r\nWhen I opened them a moment later, I beheld what might have been the\r\n“missing link,” half man, half beast. The face, with its receding\r\nforehead and beetling brows, was apelike and yet manlike. Wrapped about\r\nits loins was a large tiger skin. In its right hand it brandished a\r\nhuge, knotted club.\r\n\r\nGradually it became more manlike and less apelike. The club changed\r\nto a spear, the spear to a sword, and I beheld a Roman soldier, fully\r\naccoutered for battle, with helmet, armor, target and sandals.\r\n\r\nThe Roman soldier became a knight, and the knight a musketeer. The\r\nmusketeer became a colonial soldier.\r\n\r\nAt that instant there was a crash of glass, and the branch of a tree\r\nprojected through the window on the right of the fireplace. The shade\r\nflew up with a snap, and the soldier disappeared, as a brilliant flash\r\nof lightning illuminated the room.\r\n\r\nI rushed to the window, and saw that the overhanging limb of an elm had\r\nbeen broken off by the wind and hurled through the glass. The rain was\r\ncoming in in torrents.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper, who had heard the noise, appeared in the doorway.\r\nSeeing the rain blowing in at the window, she left and returned a\r\nmoment later with a hammer, tacks and a folded sheet. I tacked the\r\nsheet to the window frame with difficulty, on account of the strong\r\nwind, and again pulled down the shade.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rhodes retired.\r\n\r\nI consulted my watch. It lacked just one minute of midnight.\r\n\r\nOnly half of the night gone! Would I be strong enough to endure the\r\nother half?\r\n\r\n _This Story Will be Concluded in the Next Issue of WEIRD TALES. Tell\r\n              Your Newsdealer to Reserve a Copy for You._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _You Will Find Blood-Curdling\r\n Realism and a Smashing\r\n Surprise in_\r\n\r\n                          _The_ MYSTERY _of_\r\n                              BLACK JEAN\r\n\r\n                          _By_ JULIAN KILMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAye, sir, since you have asked, there has been many a guess about where\r\nBlack Jean finally disappeared to.\r\n\r\nHe was a French-Canadian and a weed of a man--six-feet-five in his\r\nsocks; his eyes were little and close together and black; he wore a\r\nlong thin mustache that drooped; and he was as hairy as his two bears.\r\n\r\nHe just drifted up here to the North, I guess, picking up what scanty\r\nliving he could by wrestling with the bears and making them wrestle\r\neach other. ’Twas in the King William hotel that many’s the time I’ve\r\nseen Black Jean drink whisky by the cupful and feed it to the bears.\r\nYes, he was interesting, especially to us boys.\r\n\r\nAlong about the time the French-Canadian and his trick animals were\r\ngetting to be an old story, there comes--begging your pardon--a Yankee,\r\nwho said he would put up a windmill at Morgan’s Cove if he could get\r\nthe quicklime to make the mortar with.\r\n\r\nBlack Jean said he knew how to make lime and if they would give him\r\ntime he would put up a kiln. So the French-Canadian went to work and\r\nbuilt that limekiln you see standing there.\r\n\r\nI was a youngster then, and I know how Black Jean, a little later,\r\nbuilt his cabin. I used to hide and watch him and his bears. They\r\nworked like men together, with an ugly-looking woman that had joined\r\nthem. They put up the cabin, the bears doing most of the heavy lifting\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe place he picked for the cabin--over there where that clump of\r\ntrees.... No, not that way--more to the right, half a mile about--that\r\nplace is called “Split Hill,” because there is a deep crack in the rock\r\nmade by some earthquake. The French-Canadian built his cabin across the\r\ncrack, and as the woman quarreled with him about the bears sleeping in\r\nthe cabin he made a trap-door in the floor of the building and stuck a\r\nsmall log down it, so the bears could climb up and down from their den\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe kiln, you can see for yourself, is a pit-kiln, so called because it\r\nis in the side of a hill and the limestone is fed from the top and the\r\nfuel from the bottom. Like a big chimney it works, and when Black Jean\r\ngot the fire started and going good it would roar up through the stone\r\nand cook it. You could see the blaze for a mile.\r\n\r\nOne day Black Jean came to the King William looking for that Yankee.\r\nSeems that individual hadn’t paid for his lime. When Black Jean didn’t\r\nfind him at the tavern he started for the Cove.\r\n\r\nI have never known who struck first; but they say the Yankee called\r\nBlack Jean a damn frog-eater and there was a fight; and that afternoon\r\nthe French-Canadian came to the tavern with his bears and all three of\r\nthem got drunk. Black Jean used to keep a muzzle on the larger of the\r\nbears, but by tilting the brute’s head he could pour whisky down its\r\nthroat. They got pretty drunk, and then someone dared Black Jean to\r\nwrestle the muzzled bear.\r\n\r\nThere was a big tree standing in front of the tavern, and close by\r\nwas a worn-out pump having a big iron handle. Black Jean and the bear\r\nwent at it under the tree, the two of them clinching and hugging and\r\nswearing until they both gasped for air. This day the big bear was\r\nrougher than usual, and Black Jean lost his temper. It was his custom\r\nwhen he got in too tight a place to kick the bear in the stomach; and\r\nthis time he began using his feet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we heard a rip of clothing. The bear had unsheathed his claws;\r\nthey were sharp as razors and tore Black Jean’s clothing into shreds\r\nand brought blood. Black Jean broke loose, his eyes flashing, his teeth\r\ngritting. Like lightning, he grabbed his dirk and leaped at the brute\r\nand jabbed the knife into its eye and gave a quick twist. The eyeball\r\npopped out and hung down by shreds alongside the bear’s jaw.\r\n\r\nNever can I forget the human-sounding shriek that bear gave, and how my\r\nfather caught me up and scrambled behind the tree as the bear started\r\nfor Black Jean. But the animal was near blinded, and Black Jean had\r\ntime to jerk the iron handle out of the pump; and then, using it as if\r\nit didn’t weigh any more than a spider’s thought, he beat the bear over\r\nthe head. He knocked it cold.\r\n\r\nThen my father said: “That bear will kill you some day, Jean.”\r\n\r\nBlack Jean stuck the iron pump handle back into its place.\r\n\r\n“_Bagosh!_ you t’ink dat true?” he sneered. “Mebbe I keel _her_, eh?”\r\n\r\nOur place was next to the piece where Black Jean lived, and it was only\r\nnext morning we heard a loud yelling over at Split Hill. I was a little\r\nfellow but spry, and when I reached Black Jean’s cabin I was ahead of\r\nmy father. I saw the French-Canadian leaning against a stump all alone,\r\nthe blood streaming from his face.\r\n\r\n“By God, M’sieu!” he blurted, when my father came up. “She scrat’ my\r\neye out.”\r\n\r\nMy father thought he meant the woman.\r\n\r\n“Who did?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Dat dam’ bear,” said Black Jean. “She just walk up an’ steeck her\r\nfoots in my eye.”\r\n\r\nFather caught hold of Black Jean and helped him to the cabin.\r\n\r\n“Which bear was it?” he asked.\r\n\r\nBlack Jean slumped forward without answering. He had fainted.\r\n\r\nI helped father get him into the house--he was more than one man could\r\ncarry--and just as we went inside there was a growling and snarling,\r\nand the big muzzled bear went sliding down that pole to her nest.\r\n\r\nWell, we looked all around for the woman, expecting to get her help;\r\nbut we couldn’t find her, which was the first we knew that she had left\r\nBlack Jean.\r\n\r\nIt took the French-Canadian’s eye two or three months to heal, and then\r\nhe came to our place to get something to wear over the empty socket. So\r\nfather hammered out a circular piece of copper about twice the size of\r\na silver dollar and bored a hole in opposite sides for a leather thong\r\nto hold it in place. Black Jean always wore it after that. He seemed\r\nvain of that piece of copper, for he used to keep it polished and\r\nshined until it glowed on a bright day like a bit of fire.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat fall the settlers opened up the first school in the district and\r\nimported a woman teacher from “The States.”\r\n\r\nI must tell you about that teacher. She was a thin, little mite of a\r\nthing that you would think the wind would blow away. Some said she was\r\npretty and some that she wasn’t. I could have called her pretty if her\r\neyes hadn’t been so black--hereabouts you don’t see many eyes that are\r\nblack--brown, maybe, and blue and gray, but not black. Fact is, there\r\nwere just two people in these parts having those black eyes: Black Jean\r\nand the little mite of a school teacher.\r\n\r\nWell she came. And she hadn’t been here a month before it was noticed\r\nthat Black Jean was coming to town more regular. And, what is more, he\r\nwas coming down by the school and waiting around there with his bears.\r\n\r\nThis went on. They say that at first she didn’t pay any attention\r\nto him, but I can’t speak for that as I was too young. But in time\r\nthere was talk and it came to me: then I watched. And I remember one\r\nafternoon after the teacher let us out we all went over to where the\r\nbears were. The teacher followed.\r\n\r\nBlack Jean was grinning and showing his white teeth.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful ladee,” says he. “Sooch eyes, mooch black like the back of a\r\nwater-bug.”\r\n\r\nTeacher smiled and said something I couldn’t understand. It must have\r\nbeen French. I had never seen a Frenchman around women before, and\r\nBlack Jean’s manners were new to me. Here was a big weed of a man\r\nbowing and scraping and standing with his cap in his hand. We boys\r\nlaughed at that--holding his cap in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe long and short of it was the French-Canadian was sparking the\r\nschool teacher. And everybody talked about it, of course; they said it\r\nwas a shame; they said if she didn’t have sense enough to see what kind\r\nof a man he was, someone should tell her.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered since what would have happened if anybody _had_\r\ngone to that woman with stories of Black Jean. I know I’d never dared\r\nto, because, without knowing why, I was afraid of her. I guess maybe\r\nthat is why the others didn’t, either.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking she was encouraging to Black Jean. She didn’t\r\nseem to object in the slightest to his attentions, and I can see them\r\nyet: her, little and pretty and in a white dress, and Black Jean\r\nlingering there with his bears, dirty, and towering head and shoulders\r\nabove her.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlack Jean kept coming and people went on talking, and finally somebody\r\nsaid she had been to Split Hill.\r\n\r\nAnd one day I began to understand it, too. It was the time she was\r\npunishing some pupils. Three of them were lined up before her, and she\r\nstarted along whacking the outstretched hands with a stout ruler. Right\r\nin front of where I was sitting stood Ben Anger. He was the smallest of\r\nthe lot and was trembling like a leaf.\r\n\r\nHer first clip at him must have raised a welt on his hands, because he\r\nwhimpered. She hit him again, and he closed his fingers. At that she\r\ncaught up the jackknife he’d been whittling at his desk with and pried\r\nat his fingers until the blood came.\r\n\r\nSitting where I was, I saw her face while she was at it. It had the\r\nexpression of a female devil. I didn’t say anything to my folks about\r\nthat; but I wasn’t surprised when word came next week that we were to\r\nhave a new teacher--the little one had gone to live with Black Jean.\r\n\r\nWell, there was more talk--talk of rail-riding the pair of them out of\r\nthe district. But nothing was done, and one evening, a month later,\r\nthere was a rap at our door and the French-Canadian staggered in. He\r\nwas carrying the school teacher in his arms.\r\n\r\n“What has happened?” my father demanded.\r\n\r\n“Dat dam’ leetle bear,” snarled Black Jean--“She try to keel Madam.”\r\n\r\nHe laid the woman on the bed. She looked pretty badly cut up, and we\r\nsent for the doctor. Mother would only let her stay in the house that\r\nnight, being shocked at the way she was living with the French-Canadian.\r\n\r\nIt turned out she wasn’t much hurt, and father kept trying to find out\r\njust what had happened. But he couldn’t. _I_ knew, however. Most of my\r\ntime, when I wasn’t in school or running errands for the folks, I was\r\nspending watching that couple, and only that afternoon I had seen her\r\nstick a hot poker into the side of the smaller bear and wind it up into\r\nhis fur until he screamed. And the bear must have bided his time and\r\ngone for her--those brutes were just like folks.\r\n\r\nNext morning Black Jean came and got his woman, and I stole out and\r\nfollowed. I knew there would be more to it. I was right. The two of\r\nthem went into the cabin, and pretty soon I heard a rumpus and out\r\ncomes Black Jean with the smaller bear and behind them the woman. She\r\nwas carrying a cowhide whip.\r\n\r\nThe French-Canadian had a chain looped about each forepaw of the\r\nanimal, and, pulling it under a tree, he tossed the free end of the\r\nchain over a stout branch and yanked the bear off his feet. Then he\r\nwound the end of the chain about the trunk of the tree and sat down. So\r\nthe bear hung, his feet trussed, and squirming and helpless.\r\n\r\nAnd there in that clear day and warm sunshine, the woman started at the\r\nbear with the whip. She lashed it until it cried like a child. Black\r\nJean watched the proceedings and grinned.\r\n\r\n“Bah!” he shouted, after the woman had begun to tire. “She t’ink you\r\nfoolin’. Heet harder. Heet the eyes!”\r\n\r\nAgain the woman went at it and kept it up until the bear quit moaning,\r\nand its head drooped and its body got limp. I was feeling sick at the\r\nsight, and I stole away.\r\n\r\nBut next morning, when I crawled back, there was the bear still\r\nhanging. It was dead.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat woman was a fair mate for Black Jean.\r\n\r\nShe kept him working steady over here to this kiln--most any night you\r\ncould see the reflection of the blaze--and it was something to watch\r\nBlack Jean when he was feeding his fire with the light playing on that\r\ncopper piece and making it look like a big red eye flashing in the\r\nnight. I saw it many times.\r\n\r\nAnd it was noticed that Black Jean wasn’t getting drunk any more, and\r\nhe wasn’t wrestling the one-eyed bear any more. He had good reason for\r\nthat. I began to believe Black Jean was afraid of that brute.\r\n\r\nBut he made it work for him in the kiln, using the whip, and it was a\r\ncurious animal, growling and snarling most of the time, as it pulled\r\nand lifted big sticks of wood and lugged them to the kiln.\r\n\r\nWhen Black Jean wasn’t working he was over at the cabin where he would\r\nfollow the woman around like a dog. She could make him do anything. She\r\nwas getting thinner and crosser, and I was more afraid of her than ever\r\nI was of Black Jean.\r\n\r\nOnce she caught me watching her from my spying-place in a tree. She\r\nhad been petting the one-eyed bear, rubbing his snout and feeding him\r\nsugar. She ran to the house and got a rifle and, my friends, I came\r\ndown out of that tree lickety split.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the ground she didn’t say a word--just let her eyes rest\r\non mine. After that I was more careful.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen something happened.\r\n\r\nI was hoeing corn one afternoon in a field next the road when I spied\r\na woman coming along from the village. She was big and blowsy and was\r\nwearing a shawl. I knew she was headed for Black Jean’s, because she\r\nclimbed through the fence on his side of the road.\r\n\r\nKeeping her in sight, I followed along my side and crossed over when\r\nI came to a place where she couldn’t see me. I followed her because I\r\nknew she was the woman who had come to Black Jean when he first landed\r\nin the district. She walked up to the cabin, and I was wondering who\r\nshe would find home, when out comes Black Jean.\r\n\r\n“_Sacre!_” he exclaimed, putting one hand to his eye. “Spik queeck! Ees\r\nit Marie?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the woman said. “I have come back.”\r\n\r\nBlack Jean looked around fearfully.\r\n\r\n“Wat you want?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to know who knocked your eye out,” she laughed.\r\n\r\nBlack Jean did not laugh.\r\n\r\n“You steal hunder’ dollar from me an’ run ’way,” he snarled. “_Bagosh!_\r\nYou give me dat monee.”\r\n\r\n“You fool!” said the woman. “You think I don’t know where you got that\r\nmoney? You killed--”\r\n\r\nA sound of rustling leaves in the wood nearby interrupted.\r\n\r\n“_Ssh!_” hissed Black Jean, his face blanching. “For de love o’ God,\r\nnod so loud.”\r\n\r\nHe listened a moment; then his expression grew crafty. His teeth\r\nshowed, and he went close to the woman and said something and started\r\ninto the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe next instant I knew someone else had seen them. It was no other\r\nthan the little ex-school teacher--and she was running away! I lay\r\nstill a moment, scared out of my wits. Then I went home.\r\n\r\n“Did you see Black Jean’s wife?” my mother asked.\r\n\r\n“You mean the school teacher woman?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” my mother said. “Who else?”\r\n\r\n“I did,” I said, “a while ago.”\r\n\r\n“I mean just now,” said my mother, breathing quick. “She rushed in\r\nhere, right into the house, and before I could stop her she snatched\r\nyour father’s rifle from the wall and ran out.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI didn’t wait to hear more.\r\n\r\nI set off through the fields for Black Jean’s. Before I had run half\r\nthe distance, I heard shooting, and it was father’s rifle--I knew the\r\nsound of her only too well.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to my spying-place it was all quiet at Black Jean’s. I could\r\nnot see a thing stirring about the cabin.\r\n\r\nThen I thought of mother and started home. Father had gone over to the\r\nCove that morning, with a load of wheat for the Yankee’s mill, and\r\nwasn’t to get back until late. So mother and I waited.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o’clock in the morning when we heard father’s wagon,\r\nand I rushed outside.\r\n\r\n“Hello, son,” he exclaimed. “You’re up late. And here’s mother, too.”\r\n\r\nFather listened to what we told him, without saying a word.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, when we had finished. “I don’t really see anything to\r\nworry about. Black Jean can take care of himself. Look there!”\r\n\r\nHe was pointing over here to this limekiln.\r\n\r\n“Jean’s had her loaded for a week,” said father, “waiting for better\r\nweather.”\r\n\r\nLater, in the house, my father said: “It is none of our business,\r\nanyway.”\r\n\r\nAnd in a little he added, as if worried some: “But I am going over\r\nthere after my rifle.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following Sunday--three days later--father and I went to Black\r\nJean’s to get the rifle.\r\n\r\nThe door of the cabin opened, and the little woman came out. She was\r\ncarrying the rifle. Somehow, she looked thin and old and her hands were\r\nlike claws. But her eyes were bright and as sharp as the teeth of a\r\nweazel trap.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” she said, as cool as a cucumber and as sweet as honey,\r\n“you have come after the rifle.”\r\n\r\n“That is what,” said my father, sternly.\r\n\r\nShe handed it over.\r\n\r\n“Please apologize to your wife for me,” she said, “for the sudden way I\r\ntook it. I was in a hurry. I saw a deer down by the marsh.”\r\n\r\n“Did you get the deer?” I piped in.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said. “I missed it.”\r\n\r\nFather and I started away. But he stopped and called: “Where is Black\r\nJean this morning?”\r\n\r\n“Black Jean!” she laughed. “Oh, he’s got another sweetheart. He has\r\ngone away with her.”\r\n\r\n“Good-day,” said father.\r\n\r\n“Good-day,” said she.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the end of that.\r\n\r\nNeither Black Jean nor the big blowsy woman was ever seen again, nor\r\nhide nor hair of them. But there was lots of talk. You see, there\r\nhadn’t been any deer in these parts for many years; and besides it just\r\nwas not possible for so well known a character as Black Jean to vanish\r\nso completely, without leaving a single trace.\r\n\r\nWell, finally someone laid information in the county seat and over\r\ncomes a smart young chap. He questioned father and mother and made me\r\ntell him all I knew, and took it all down in writing; then he gets a\r\nconstable and goes over and they arrest the little black-eyed woman.\r\n\r\nThere was no trouble about it. They say she just smiled and asked what\r\nshe was being arrested for--and they told her for the murder of Black\r\nJean. She didn’t say anything to that; only asked that someone feed the\r\nbig one-eyed bear during the time she was locked up.\r\n\r\nThen the people started coming. They came on horseback, they came\r\nafoot, they came in canoes, they came in lumber wagons--no matter how\r\nfar away they lived--and brought their own food along. I calculate near\r\nevery soul in the district turned out and made it a sort of general\r\nholiday and lay-off, for certain it is that no one cared anything about\r\nBlack Jean himself.\r\n\r\nEvery inch of the land hereabouts was searched; they poked along the\r\nentire length of that earthquake crack, and in the clearings, and in\r\nthe bush, looking for fresh-turned earth. But they could not find a\r\nthing--not a thing!\r\n\r\nNow you gentlemen know that you can’t convict a person for murder\r\nunless you have got positive proof that murder’s been done--the dead\r\nbody itself. Which was the case here, and that smart youth from the\r\ncounty seat had to let the little woman go free. So she came back to\r\nthe cabin, living there as quiet as you please and minding her own\r\nprecise business.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a pocket-piece I have had for some time. You can see for\r\nyourself that it is copper.\r\n\r\nIt is the thing my father made for Black Jean to wear over his bad\r\neye. I found that piece of copper two years after the little woman\r\ndied--near twelve years after Black Jean disappeared. And I found it\r\nin the ashes and stone at the bottom of the limekiln standing there,\r\nhalf-tumbled down.\r\n\r\nA lot of people hereabouts say it doesn’t follow that Black Jean’s body\r\nwas burned in the kiln--cremated, I guess you city chaps would call\r\nit. They can’t figure out how the mischief a little ninety-pound woman\r\ncould have lugged those two bodies after she shot them with my father’s\r\nrifle, the distance from the cabin to the kiln--a good half mile and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThey point out that the body of Black Jean must have weighed over two\r\nhundred pounds, not to mention that the other woman was big and fat.\r\nBut they make me weary.\r\n\r\nIt is as simple as the nose on your face: _The big one-eyed bear did\r\nthe job for her!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _THE GRAVE_\r\n\r\n                        A Story of Stark Terror\r\n\r\n                        _By Orville R. Emerson_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of this story was first brought to my attention when Fromwiller\r\nreturned from his trip to Mount Kemmel, with a very strange tale indeed\r\nand one extremely hard to believe.\r\n\r\nBut I believed it enough to go back to the Mount with “From” to see if\r\nwe could discover anything more. And after digging for awhile at the\r\nplace where “From’s” story began, we made our way into an old dugout\r\nthat had been caved in, or at least where all the entrances had been\r\nfilled with dirt, and there we found, written on German correspondence\r\npaper, a terrible story.\r\n\r\nWe found the story on Christmas day, 1918, while making the trip in\r\nthe colonel’s machine from Watou, in Flanders, where our regiment was\r\nstationed. Of course, you have heard of Mount Kemmel in Flanders: more\r\nthan once it figured in newspaper reports as it changed hands during\r\nsome of the fiercest fighting of the war. And when the Germans were\r\nfinally driven from this point of vantage, in October, 1918, a retreat\r\nwas started which did not end until it became a race to see who could\r\nget into Germany first.\r\n\r\nThe advance was so fast that the victorious British and French forces\r\nhad no time to bury their dead, and, terrible as it may seem to those\r\nwho have not seen it, in December of that year one could see the\r\nrotting corpses of the unburied dead scattered here and there over the\r\ntop of Mount Kemmel. It was a place of ghastly sights and sickening\r\nodors. And it was there that we found this tale.\r\n\r\nWith the chaplain’s help, we translated the story, which follows:\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“For two weeks I have been buried alive! For two weeks I have not seen\r\ndaylight, nor heard the sound of another person’s voice. Unless I can\r\nfind something to do, besides this everlasting digging, I shall go mad.\r\nSo I shall write. As long as my candles last, I will pass part of the\r\ntime each day in setting down on paper my experiences.\r\n\r\n“Not that I need to do this in order to remember them. God knows that\r\nwhen I get out the first thing I shall do will be to try to forget\r\nthem! But if I should _not_ get out!...\r\n\r\n“I am an Ober-lieutenant in the Imperial German Army. Two weeks ago my\r\nregiment was holding Mount Kemmel in Flanders. We were surrounded on\r\nthree sides and subjected to a terrific artillery fire, but on account\r\nof the commanding position we were ordered to hold the Mount to the\r\nlast man. Our engineers, however, had made things very comfortable.\r\nNumerous deep dugouts had been constructed, and in them we were\r\ncomparatively safe from shell-fire.\r\n\r\n“Many of these had been connected by passageways so that there was a\r\nregular little underground city, and the majority of the garrison never\r\nleft the protection of the dugouts. But even under these conditions our\r\ncasualties were heavy. Lookouts had to be maintained above ground, and\r\nonce in a while a direct hit by one of the huge railway guns would even\r\ndestroy some of the dugouts.\r\n\r\n“A little over two weeks ago--I can’t be sure, because I have lost\r\ntrack of the exact number of days--the usual shelling was increased a\r\nhundred fold. With about twenty others, I was sleeping in one of the\r\nshallower dugouts. The tremendous increase in shelling awakened me with\r\na start, and my first impulse was to go at once into a deeper dugout,\r\nwhich was connected to the one I was in by an underground passageway.\r\n\r\n“It was a smaller dugout, built a few feet lower than the one I was in.\r\nIt had been used as a sort of a storeroom and no one was supposed to\r\nsleep there. But it seemed safer to me, and, alone, I crept into it. A\r\nthousand times since I have wished I had taken another man with me. But\r\nmy chances for doing it were soon gone.\r\n\r\n“I had hardly entered the smaller dugout when there was a tremendous\r\nexplosion behind me. The ground shook as if a mine had exploded below\r\nus. Whether that was indeed the case, or whether some extra large\r\ncaliber explosive shell had struck the dugout behind me, I never knew.\r\n\r\n“After the shock of the explosion had passed I went back to the\r\npassageway. When about half-way along it, I found the timbers above\r\nhad fallen, allowing the earth to settle, and my way was effectually\r\nblocked.\r\n\r\n“So I returned to the dugout and waited alone through several hours of\r\nterrific shelling. The only other entrance to the dugout I was in was\r\nthe main entrance from the trench above, and all those who had been\r\nabove ground had gone into dugouts long before this. So I could not\r\nexpect anyone to enter while the shelling continued; and when it ceased\r\nthere would surely be an attack.\r\n\r\n“As I did not want to be killed by a grenade thrown down the entrance;\r\nI remained awake in order to rush out at the first signs of cessation\r\nof the bombardment and join what comrades there might be left on the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n“After about six hours of the heavy bombardment, all sound above ground\r\nseemed to cease. Five minutes went by, then ten; surely the attack\r\nwas coming. I rushed to the stairway leading out to the air. I took\r\na couple of strides up the stairs. There was a blinding flash and a\r\ndeafening explosion.\r\n\r\n“I felt myself falling. Then darkness swallowed everything.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“How long I lay unconscious in the dugout I never knew.\r\n\r\n“But after what seemed like a long time, I practically grew conscious\r\nof a dull ache in my left arm. I could not move it. I opened my eyes\r\nand found only darkness. I felt pain and a stiffness all over my body.\r\n\r\n“Slowly I rose, struck a match, found a candle and lit it and looked at\r\nmy watch. It had stopped. I did not know how long I had remained there\r\nunconscious. All noise of bombardment had ceased. I stood and listened\r\nfor some time, but could hear no sound of any kind.\r\n\r\n“My gaze fell on the stairway entrance. I started in alarm. The end of\r\nthe dugout, where the entrance was, was half filled with dirt.\r\n\r\n“I went over and looked closer. The entrance was completely filled with\r\ndirt at the bottom, and no light of any kind could be seen from above.\r\nI went to the passageway to the other dugout, although I remembered it\r\nhad caved in. I examined the fallen timbers closely. Between two of\r\nthem I could feel a slight movement of air. Here was an opening to the\r\noutside world.\r\n\r\n“I tried to move the timbers, as well as I could with one arm, only to\r\nprecipitate a small avalanche of dirt which filled the crack. Quickly\r\nI dug at the dirt until again I could feel the movement of air. This\r\nmight be the only place where I could obtain fresh air.\r\n\r\n“I was convinced that it would take some little work to open up either\r\nof the passageways, and I began to feel hungry. Luckily, there was a\r\ngood supply of canned foods and hard bread, for the officers had kept\r\ntheir rations stored in this dugout. I also found a keg of water and\r\nabout a dozen bottles of wine, which I discovered to be very good.\r\nAfter I had relieved my appetite and finished one of the bottles of\r\nwine, I felt sleepy and, although my left arm pained me considerably,\r\nI soon dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\n“The time I have allowed myself for writing is up, so I will stop for\r\ntoday. After I have performed my daily task of digging tomorrow, I\r\nshall again write. Already my mind feels easier. Surely help will come\r\nsoon. At any rate, within two more weeks I shall have liberated myself.\r\nAlready I am half way up the stairs. And my rations will last that\r\nlong. I have divided them so they will.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I did not feel like writing after I finished my digging. My\r\narm pained me considerably. I guess I used it too much.\r\n\r\n“But today I was more careful with it, and it feels better. And I am\r\nworried again. Twice today big piles of earth caved in, where the\r\ntimbers above were loose, and each time as much dirt fell into the\r\npassageway as I can remove in a day. Two days more before I can count\r\non getting out by myself.\r\n\r\n“The rations will have to be stretched out some more. The daily amount\r\nis already pretty small. But I shall go on with my account.\r\n\r\n“From the time I became conscious I started my watch, and since then\r\nI have kept track of the days. On the second day I took stock of the\r\nfood, water, wood, matches, candles, etc., and found a plentiful supply\r\nfor two weeks at least. At that time I did not look forward to a stay\r\nof more than a few days in my prison.\r\n\r\n“Either the enemy or ourselves will occupy the hill I told myself,\r\nbecause it is such an important position. And whoever now holds the\r\nhill will be compelled to dig in deeply in order to hold it.\r\n\r\n“So to my mind it was only a matter of a few days until either the\r\nentrance or the passageway would be cleared, and my only doubts were as\r\nto whether it would be friends or enemies that would discover me. My\r\narm felt better, although I could not use it much, and so I spent the\r\nday in reading an old newspaper which I found among the food supplies,\r\nand in waiting for help to come. What fool I was! If I had only worked\r\nfrom the start, I would be just that many days nearer deliverance.\r\n\r\n“On the third day I was annoyed by water, which began dripping from the\r\nroof and seeping in at the sides of the dugout. I cursed that muddy\r\nwater, then, as I have often cursed such dugout nuisances before, but\r\nit may be that I shall yet bless that water and it shall save my life.\r\n\r\n“But it certainly made things uncomfortable; so I spent the day in\r\nmoving my bunk, food and water supplies, candles, etc., up into the\r\npassageway. For a space of about ten feet it was unobstructed, and,\r\nbeing slightly higher than the dugout, was dryer and more comfortable.\r\nBesides, the air was much better here, as I had found that practically\r\nall my supply of fresh air came in through the crack between the\r\ntimbers, and I thought maybe the rats wouldn’t bother me so much at\r\nnight. Again I spent the balance of the day simply in waiting for help.\r\n\r\n“It was not until well into the fourth day that I really began to feel\r\nuneasy. It suddenly became impressed on my consciousness that I had not\r\nheard the sound of a gun, or felt the earth shake from the force of a\r\nconcussion, since the fatal shell that had filled the entrance. What\r\nwas the meaning of the silence? Why did I hear no sounds of fighting?\r\nIt was as still as the grave.\r\n\r\n“What a horrible death to die! Buried Alive! A panic of fear swept over\r\nme. But my will and reason reasserted itself. In time, I should be able\r\nto dig myself out by my own efforts. It would take time but it could be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n“So, although I could not use my left arm as yet, I spent the rest of\r\nthat day and all of the two following days in digging dirt from the\r\nentrance and carrying it back into the far corner of the dugout.\r\n\r\n“On the seventh day after regaining consciousness I was tired and stiff\r\nfrom my unwanted exertions of the three previous days. I could see by\r\nthis time that it was a matter of weeks--two or three, at least--before\r\nI could hope to liberate myself. I might be rescued at an earlier\r\ndate, but, without outside aid, it would take probably three more weeks\r\nof labor before I could dig my way out.\r\n\r\n“Already dirt had caved in from the top, where the timbers had sprung\r\napart, and I could repair the damage to the roof of the stairway only\r\nin a crude way with one arm. But my left arm was much better. With a\r\nday’s rest, I would be able to use it pretty well. Besides, I must\r\nconserve my energy. So I spent the seventh day in rest and prayer for\r\nmy speedy release from a living grave.\r\n\r\n“I also reapportioned my food on the basis of three more weeks. It\r\nmade the daily portions pretty small, especially as the digging was\r\nstrenuous work. There was a large supply of candles, so that I had\r\nplenty of light for my work. But the supply of water bothered me.\r\nAlmost half of the small keg was gone in the first week. I decided to\r\ndrink only once a day.\r\n\r\n“The following six days were all days of feverish labor, light eating\r\nand even lighter drinking. But, despite all my efforts, only a quarter\r\nof the keg was left at the end of two weeks. And the horror of the\r\nsituation grew on me. My imagination would not be quiet. I would\r\npicture to myself the agonies to come, when I would have even less\r\nfood and water than at present. My mind would run on and on--to death\r\nby starvation--to the finding of my emaciated body by those who would\r\neventually open up the dugout--even to their attempts to reconstruct\r\nthe story of my end.\r\n\r\n“And, adding to my physical discomfort, were the swarming vermin\r\ninfesting the dugout and my person. A month had gone by since I had had\r\na bath, and I could not now spare a drop of water even to wash my face.\r\nThe rats had become so bold that I had to leave a candle burning all\r\nnight in order to protect myself in my sleep.\r\n\r\n“Partly to relieve my mind, I started to write this tale of my\r\nexperiences. It did act as a relief at first, but now, as I read it\r\nover, the growing terror of this awful place grips me. I would cease\r\nwriting, but some impulse urges me to write each day.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Three weeks have passed since I was buried in this living tomb.\r\n\r\n“Today I drank the last drop of water in the keg. There is a pool\r\nof stagnant water on the dugout floor--dirty, slimy and alive with\r\nvermin--always standing there, fed by drippings from the roof. As yet I\r\ncannot bring myself to touch it.\r\n\r\n“Today I divided up my food supply for another week. God knows the\r\nportions were already small enough! But there have been so many\r\ncave-ins recently that I can never finish clearing the entrance in\r\nanother week.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I feel that I shall never clear it. But I _must_! I can\r\nnever bear to die here. I must will myself to escape, and _I shall\r\nescape_!\r\n\r\n“Did not the captain often say that the will to win was half the\r\nvictory? I shall rest no more. Every waking hour must be spent in\r\nremoving the treacherous dirt.\r\n\r\n“Even my writing must cease.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Oh, God! I am afraid, _afraid_!\r\n\r\n“I must write to relieve my mind. Last night I went to sleep at nine\r\nby my watch. At twelve I woke to find myself in the dark, frantically\r\ndigging with my bare hands at the hard sides of the dugout. After some\r\ntrouble I found a candle and lit it.\r\n\r\n“The whole dugout was upset. My food supplies were lying in the mud.\r\nThe box of candles had been spilled. My finger nails were broken and\r\nbloody from clawing at the ground.\r\n\r\n“The realization dawned upon me that I had been out of my head. And\r\nthen came the fear--dark, raging fear--fear of insanity. I have been\r\ndrinking the stagnant water from the floor for days. I do not know how\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n“I have only about one meal left, but I must save it.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I had a meal today. For three days I have been without food.\r\n\r\n“But today I caught one of the rats that infest the place. He was a\r\nbig one, too. Gave me a bad bite, but I killed him. I feel lots better\r\ntoday. Have had some bad dreams lately, but they don’t bother me now.\r\n\r\n“That rat was tough, though. Think I’ll finish this digging and go back\r\nto my regiment in a day or two.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Heaven have mercy! I must be out of my head half the time now.\r\n\r\n“I have absolutely no recollection of having written that last entry.\r\nAnd I feel feverish and weak.\r\n\r\n“If I had my strength, I think I could finish clearing the entrance in\r\na day or two. But I can only work a short time at a stretch.\r\n\r\n“I am beginning to give up hope.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Wild spells come on me oftener now. I awake tired out from exertions,\r\nwhich I cannot remember.\r\n\r\n“Bones of rats, picked clean, are scattered about, yet I do not\r\nremember eating them. In my lucid moments I don’t seem to be able to\r\ncatch them, for they are too wary and I am too weak.\r\n\r\n“I get some relief by chewing the candles, but I dare not eat them all.\r\nI am afraid of the dark, I am afraid of the rats, but worst of all is\r\nthe hideous fear of myself.\r\n\r\n“My mind is breaking down. I must escape soon, or I will be little\r\nbetter than a wild animal. Oh, God, send help! I am going mad!”\r\n\r\n“Terror, desperation, despair--is this the end?”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“For a long time I have been resting.\r\n\r\n“I have had a brilliant idea. Rest brings back strength. The longer\r\na person rests the stronger they should get. I have been resting a\r\nlong time now. Weeks or months, I don’t know which. So I must be very\r\nstrong. I feel strong. My fever has left me. So listen! There is only a\r\nlittle dirt left in the entrance way. I am going out and crawl through\r\nit. Just like a mole. Right out into the sunlight. I feel much stronger\r\nthan a mole. So this is the end of my little tale. A sad tale, but one\r\nwith a happy ending. Sunlight! A very happy ending.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd that was the end of the manuscript. There only remains to tell\r\nFromwiller’s tale.\r\n\r\nAt first, I didn’t believe it. But now I do. I put it down, though,\r\njust as Fromwiller told it to me, and you can take it or leave it as\r\nyou choose.\r\n\r\n“Soon after we were billeted at Watou,” said Fromwiller, “I decided\r\nto go out and see Mount Kemmel. I had heard that things were rather\r\ngruesome out there, but I was really not prepared for the conditions\r\nthat I found. I had seen unburied dead around Roulers and in the\r\nArgonne, but it had been almost two months since the fighting on Mount\r\nKemmel and there were still many unburied dead. But there was another\r\nthing that I had never seen, and that was the _buried living_!\r\n\r\n“As I came up to the highest point of the Mount, I was attracted by\r\na movement of loose dirt on the edge of a huge shell hole. The dirt\r\nseemed to be falling in to a common center, as if the dirt below was\r\nbeing removed. As I watched, suddenly I was horrified to see a long,\r\nskinny human arm emerge from the ground.\r\n\r\n“It disappeared, drawing back some of the earth with it. There was a\r\nmovement of dirt over a larger area, and the arm reappeared, together\r\nwith a man’s head and shoulders. He pulled himself up out of the very\r\nground, as it seemed, shook the dirt from his body like a huge, gaunt\r\ndog, and stood erect. I never want to see such another creature!\r\n\r\n“Hardly a strip of clothing was visible, and, what little there was,\r\nwas so torn and dirty that it was impossible to tell what kind it had\r\nbeen. The skin was drawn tightly over the bones, and there was a vacant\r\nstare in the protruding eyes. It looked like a corpse that had lain in\r\nthe grave a long time.\r\n\r\n“This apparition looked directly at me, and yet did not appear to see\r\nme. He looked as if the light bothered him. I spoke, and a look of fear\r\ncame over his face. He seemed filled with terror.\r\n\r\n“I stepped toward him, shaking loose a piece of barbed wire which had\r\ncaught in my puttees. Quick as a flash, he turned and started to run\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\n“For a second I was too astonished to move. Then I started to follow\r\nhim. In a straight line he ran, looking neither to the right or left.\r\nDirectly ahead of him was a deep and wide trench. He was running\r\nstraight toward it. Suddenly it dawned on me that he did not see it.\r\n\r\n“I called out, but it seemed to terrify him all the more, and with one\r\nlast lunge he stepped into the trench and fell. I heard his body strike\r\nthe other side of the trench and fell with a splash into the water at\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n“I followed and looked down into the trench. There he lay, with his\r\nhead bent back in such a position that I was sure his neck was broken.\r\nHe was half in and half out of the water, and as I looked at him I\r\ncould scarcely believe what I had seen. Surely he looked as if he had\r\nbeen dead as long as some of the other corpses, scattered over the\r\nhillside. I turned and left him as he was.\r\n\r\n“Buried while living, I left him unburied when dead.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Fantastic Story\r\n         With An Odd Twist\r\n                    At The End_\r\n\r\n                           Hark! The Rattle!\r\n\r\n                       _By_ Joel Townsley Rogers\r\n\r\n\r\nWe sat in the Purple Lily--Tain Dirk, that far too handsome young man,\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nI drank coffee; Tain Dirk drank liquor--secretly and alone. The night\r\nwas drenched with sweating summer heat, but I felt cold as ice.\r\nPresently we went up to the Palm Grove Roof, where Bimi Tal was to\r\ndance.\r\n\r\n“Who is this Bimi Tal, Hammer?” Dirk asked me, drumming his fingers.\r\n\r\n“A woman.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a queer one, Jerry Hammer!” said Dirk, narrowing his cold\r\nyellow eyes.\r\n\r\nStill he drummed his blunt fingers. Sharp--_tat! tat! tat!_ Something\r\ndeep inside me--my liver, perhaps--shivered and grew white at hearing\r\nthat klirring sound.\r\n\r\nI didn’t answer him right away. Slowly I sent up smoke rings to circle\r\nthe huge stars. We sat in a cave of potted palms close by the dancing\r\nfloor. Over us lay blue-black night, strange and deep. Yellow as roses\r\nwere the splotches of stars swimming down the sky.\r\n\r\n“It shows you’ve been away from New York, Dirk, if you don’t know Bimi\r\nTal. She’s made herself more famous as a dancer than ever was Ynecita.\r\nSome mystery is supposed to hang about her; and these simple children\r\nof New York love mysteries.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been away three years,” said Dirk sulkily, his eyes\r\ncontracting....\r\n\r\n“That long? It was three years ago that Ynecita was killed.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Dirk. His finger-drumming droned away.\r\n\r\n“I thought you might have known her, Dirk.”\r\n\r\n“I?” His wide, thin lips twitched. “Why, Ynecita was common to half New\r\nYork!”\r\n\r\n“But once,” I said, “once, it may be assumed, she was true to one man\r\nonly, Tain Dirk.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not interested in women,” said Dirk.\r\n\r\nThat was like him. He drank liquor only--secretly and alone.\r\n\r\n“I was interested in Ynecita, Dirk. We used to talk together--”\r\n\r\n“She talked to you?” repeated Dirk.\r\n\r\n“Strange how she died! No trace, no one arrested. Yet she’d had her\r\nlovers. Sometimes I think, Dirk, we’ll find the beast who killed\r\nYnecita.”\r\n\r\nTain Dirk touched my wrist. His blunt fingers were cold and clammy.\r\nIncomprehensible that women had loved his hands! Yet they were artist’s\r\nhands, and could mold and chisel. Wet clay, his hands!\r\n\r\n“What makes you say that, Hammer?”\r\n\r\nI looked up at the stars. “It was a beast who killed Ynecita, Dirk.\r\nSome vile snake with blood as cold as this lemon ice. Those marks of\r\nteeth on her upper arm! Deep in, bringing blood! What madman killed\r\nthat girl? _Mad_, I say!”\r\n\r\nDirk twisted. He wiped his brown forehead, on which sweat glistened in\r\nlittle beads like scales. “Too hot a night to talk about such things,\r\nHammer. Let’s talk of something else. Tell me about this Bimi Tal.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll see her soon enough,” I said, watching him. “A girl of about\r\nyour own age; you’re not more than twenty-four, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Born first of January, ’99.”\r\n\r\n“And famous already!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Tain Dirk. “I guess you’ve heard of me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ve heard lots of you,” I said; and saw he didn’t like it.\r\n\r\n“You’ve heard I’m fast with women, eh?” asked Dirk, after a pause.\r\n\r\n“But Ynecita--”\r\n\r\n“Why do you talk of _her_?” asked Dirk, irritably. “I never knew her.”\r\n\r\n“Those marks of teeth on Ynecita’s arm--two sharp canines, sharp and\r\nhooked; barely scratching the skin--like fangs of a snake, Dirk--”\r\n\r\nTain Dirk’s hand crept to his lips, which were thin, red, and dry. The\r\nlight in his eyes darkened from yellow to purple. Softly his blunt\r\nfingers began to drum his lips. _Tat! tat! tat!_ But silent as a snake\r\nin grass.\r\n\r\n“A curious thing about teeth, Dirk--you’re a sculptor; maybe you’ve\r\nobserved it--a curious thing that no two are quite alike. We took\r\nprints, Dirk, of those marks in the arm of Ynecita--”\r\n\r\nDirk’s thin lips opened. His coarsely-formed, but marvelously\r\nsensitive, fingers felt the hardness of his teeth. That gesture was\r\nsly. At once he knew I’d seen him. He crouched back in his chair, his\r\nstrong, broad head drawn in between his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he hissed.\r\n\r\nAgain the klirring of his fingertips--a dusty drumming.\r\n\r\n“Why, I am only Jerry Hammer--a wanderer, and a soldier of bad fortune.”\r\n\r\n“_Who are you!_”\r\n\r\n“Brother of Stella Hammer, who was known as Ynecita, the dancer.”\r\n\r\nUpon the Palm Grove Roof, beneath those gigantic stars the orchestra\r\nbegan to play. A brass and cymbal tune. The air was hot. From far in\r\nthe pit of streets rose up the noises of the city. Loud! Discord shot\r\nwith flames. I trembled.\r\n\r\nTain Dirk’s fingers drummed. His head commenced to sway.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _II._\r\n\r\nBimi Tal danced barefooted on the glazed umber tiles of the Roof.\r\n\r\nHer dark red hair was free on her naked shoulders. _Stamp! stamp!\r\nstamp!_ her feet struck flatly on the tiles. Her head was bent back\r\nalmost to the level of her waist. Bracelets jangled on her wrists and\r\nankles.\r\n\r\n “_I am the daughter of the morning! I shout, I dance, I laugh\r\n away...._”\r\n\r\nShaking her clump of red hair; her strong muscled limbs weaving;\r\nlaughing at me with all her eyes. How like she looked to a man dead\r\nlong years before! How like her glances to the glances of Red Roane!\r\nOn her breasts two glittering shields of spangles. About her waist\r\na kirtle seemingly woven of long strands of marsh grass, rustling,\r\nshivering with whispers. The sinews of her trunk and limbs rippled\r\nbeneath her clear brown skin.\r\n\r\nThe head of Tain Dirk swayed sideways, slowly. The drumming of his\r\nfingers on the table was a reiterative rattle. His eyes--liquid,\r\nsubtle--dulled with a look near to stupidity, then blazed to golden\r\nfire. Thin and wide were his unsmiling lips. His tongue flicked them.\r\n_Tat! tat! tat!_\r\n\r\n“She’s a beauty!” whispered Dirk.\r\n\r\nHis terrible eyes seemed to call Bimi Tal as they had called other\r\nwomen. Mesmerism--what was it? Singing, she pranced toward the den of\r\npotted palms where we were sitting. Her skirt rustled like the marshes.\r\nWind of summer.\r\n\r\nLittle searchlights, playing colored lights on Bimi Tal, grew darker.\r\nRed and violet deepened to brown and green. Still the hot stars above\r\nus. In that artificial paper Palm Grove, with the silky puffy women and\r\nthe beefsteak-guzzling men looking stupidly, was born the mystery of\r\nthe great savannahs.\r\n\r\nDirk’s head nodding. Dirk’s thin lips slowly opening. Dirk’s golden\r\neyes glimmering. _Tat! tat! tat!_ Dirk’s steady fingers.\r\n\r\nThe great savannahs and the tropic marshes. Bimi Tal dancing.\r\nStealthily, the music softened from that brass and cymbal tune. It\r\nrustled. It crawled. It reared fanged heads.\r\n\r\nFor a little while I did not see Bimi Tal nor Dirk, but the steamy\r\nEverglades. Winter noon. Grass leaves silvered by sea-wind; puddles\r\nstirring at the roots of the grasses. Silence booming like the loud\r\nsilence of death.\r\n\r\nBimi Tal was dancing her snake dance. Dirk’s lips quivered.\r\n\r\nThe marsh wind makes a little stir (it is the whispering flute.) The\r\nmarsh waters make a little moan (it is the violin).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _III._\r\n\r\nWhere was the soul of Bimi Tal dwelling that tropic winter so many\r\nyears ago? On her mother’s breast, a little bud of love, crooned over\r\nwith the song of sleep? Or meshed in bleeding poinsettia or rose? Or a\r\nsoul yet unborn?\r\n\r\nI close my eyes. The vision does not fade. Florida; the marshlands;\r\nwinter noon. January’s first day, 1899. Where was lovely Bimi Tal on\r\nthat stifling day we saw the fanged thing coil, and death struck us\r\nthere by Okechobee?\r\n\r\nYour eyes, Bimi Tal, are the laughing eyes of Red Roane!...\r\n\r\nNow the snake dance. The piccolo screams.\r\n\r\nLife immortal in your glistening lips, Bimi Tal; in your deep bosom\r\npromise of everlasting fecundity. Passion and power of the earth! Life\r\nis immortal. Your laughing eyes, Bimi Tal, will never dull. Yet I saw\r\nRed Roane die....\r\n\r\nBeneath the shifting lights, Bimi Tal leaped and spun, scarcely\r\ntreading the floor. Her eyes sparkled at me. She did not see Tain Dirk.\r\n_Stamp! Stamp! Stamp!_ Her bare feet struck the tiles, tightening the\r\nmuscles of her calves. Her bangles rang.\r\n\r\nI could not keep my eyes from Dirk. His broad brown-and-golden head\r\nswayed continually. His thin lips worked, and I caught the flash of his\r\nteeth. His eyes drowsed, then flashed open with sudden flame. _Tat!\r\ntat! tat!_ The rattling of his fingers was never still.\r\n\r\nThat swaying head! It was loaded with the wisdom of the serpent that\r\nharkens to the wind, swaying with the marsh grass, winding its golden\r\ncoils, curving its neck to the sun--_Hark! The rattle!_\r\n\r\n... Red is the sun. Two men plow through the marshes. O endless pain\r\n(the harsh viol quivers), a life struggles in the womb. Who will die,\r\nand what will die, that this new life may be born? Whimpering agony.\r\nAnd an old crone singing a song....\r\n\r\nAll people who sat within the Palm Grove were hushed, watching Bimi\r\nTal. Fat hands fanning powdered breasts; silk handkerchiefs wiping ox\r\nnecks; sweat beneath armpits. Still heat. Far away thunder. The stars\r\ngoing by.\r\n\r\nMusic swelled. Beneath its discord sounded a steady drumming rhythm.\r\nThe arms of Bimi Tal waved about her head. She shouted for joy of life.\r\n\r\nThe pale eyes of Dirk, basking in mystery, gleamed into fire, blazed up\r\nin fury and hate undying! His dry lips opened. I saw his teeth.\r\n\r\n... Through the breast-high grasses surge on the two marching men.\r\nTheir boots sough in the muck. (Softly strums the bass viol.) Something\r\nwaiting in the marshes! Something with golden eyes and swaying head.\r\n_Hark! The rattle!_ Beware, for death is in the path!...\r\n\r\nBimi Tal was close to Dirk, not seeing him. She laughed and waved her\r\njangling arms at me. Dirk’s eyes sparkled with madness, his lips were\r\ntightened terribly. Bimi Tal was almost over him. His fingers drummed.\r\nLouder played the music.\r\n\r\n... _Hark! The rattle!_ Gaily the two men plow through the bladed\r\ngrasses. The coiled thing waits, hate within its eyes. They are\r\nnearer--nearer! (Drums begin to beat)....\r\n\r\nIn an avalanche of sound, crashed viol and violin, and stammering drum.\r\nDirk’s drawn head lunged upward with his shoulders, his lips opened and\r\nlifted.\r\n\r\nVenomous his look. Deathly his intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IV._\r\n\r\nStrong and young, fresh from the Cuban wars, Red Roane and I went north\r\nfrom the keys through the Everglades of Florida.\r\n\r\nThrough the fens as in God’s first day. Through the reptile age, alive\r\nyet and crawling. Through strangling vegetation, which steams and rots\r\nbeneath eternal suns. Through the everlasting Everglades, with their\r\nfern and frond and sorrowful, hoary cypress, Red Roane and I went\r\nnorth. Onward with laughter. What joy lay in our hearts! We sang many\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nFern and flower embracing in fecundity. Grasses thick with sap.\r\nBlossoms wilting at a touch. Mire teeming with creeping life. Above\r\nall, the gay sun. Beneath all, the coiling serpent eyes and the opened\r\nfangs. _Hark! The rattle!_\r\n\r\nWe sailed lagoons in crazy craft; dreamt on shady shores through sultry\r\nnoons; shouted to the dead logs on river banks till they took fear, and\r\ndived and splashed away. We pitched our tents by black waters. We beat\r\nbrave trails through the fens.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to stay here forever,” said Red Roane.\r\n\r\nBy what way I go, with what drinks I drink, in what bed I lie down, I\r\nremember you who got your prayer, Red Roane--you who are in the swamp\r\ngrass and swamp water forever.\r\n\r\nBeating our way slow and heavily, at high noon, of the new year’s first\r\nday in 1899, near Okechobee in the marshes, came we two on a hidden\r\nhut. It was fashioned of the raff of the slough--dead fronds, rotting\r\nbranches, withered marsh grasses. Its sad gray-green were in the living\r\nwilderness like a monument to death. Better the naked swamp. Better the\r\nclean quagmire for bed.\r\n\r\nAn old crone, moaning within that dreary hut, drowned out the sharp,\r\nshort gasps of another woman. Red Roane came up singing, slapping his\r\ndeep chest, swinging his muscular arms. Sunlight on his brown face, and\r\nsunlight in his red hair. At the hut’s door, facing us, lounged a man\r\nwith yellow eyes. Poor white trash. A gun was in his arm’s crook. He\r\nspat tobacco juice at the earth. There was loathing, murder venom in\r\nhis face!\r\n\r\nRed Roane faltered back from that stare. He stopped short, and laughter\r\nleft him. His brave eyes were troubled by that madman’s hate. Yellow\r\neyes staring--eyes of a rattlesnake!\r\n\r\nAn old Indian crone peered out beneath the crooked elbow of the ruffian\r\nin the doorway, she who had been dolorously singing. With a scream, she\r\nthrust out her skinny old arm, pointing it at Red Roane.\r\n\r\n“He dies!” she screamed. “We want his soul!”\r\n\r\nAnother woman, hidden, moaning within the hut; a woman in her travail.\r\nNew life from the womb--a life must die! I grasped the arm of Red Roane.\r\n\r\n“Come away!” I said, “Come away from these mad witches!”\r\n\r\nIn three steps that gray-green hovel was hidden in the cypresses. A\r\ndream it seemed. But we could yet hear the old witch woman singing.\r\nSomething dragged at our heels, and it was not suction of the muck.\r\n\r\nToe to heel, Red Roane paced me, and we sang a song together. A crimson\r\nflower, short-stemmed, yellow-hearted, was almost beneath my boot. I\r\nstooped--who will not stoop to pick a crimson wild flower? A rattling,\r\nlike the shaking of peas. A klirring like the drumming of a man’s\r\nfingertips. _Hark! The rattle!_\r\n\r\nA yawning head flashed beneath my hand, striking too low. Heavy as a\r\nhard-flung stone, the snake’s head struck my ankle; yawning gullet,\r\nwhite-hooked fangs of the deathly rattlesnake. Out of the crimson\r\nflower that beast of gold and brown. Its yellow eyes flickered. Its\r\nthin lips were dry. How near I had touched to death!\r\n\r\n“Thank God for those heavy boots, Jerry!”\r\n\r\nWith blazing eyes the snake writhed, coiling for another strike. Its\r\nsharp tail, pointed upward, vibrated continuously with dusty laughter.\r\nIts golden rippling body was thick as my arm.\r\n\r\nRed Roane swung down his heavy marching stock. _Crash!_ Its leaden\r\nend struck that lunging mottled head. Halted in mid-strike, that evil\r\nwisdom splattered like an egg, brain pan ripped wide.\r\n\r\nThe rattler lashed in its last agony, its tremendously muscular tail\r\nbeating the ground with thumping blows, its yellow eyes still blazing\r\nwith hate, but closing fast in doom.\r\n\r\nI tried to say “Thanks, Red!”\r\n\r\nSome mesmerism in those yellow, dying eyes! Shaking with disgust, Red\r\nRoane bent above that foul fen watcher, put down his hand to pick up\r\nthat stricken skin, over whose eyes thin eye-membrane already lowered\r\nin death.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch it, Red! Wait till the sun goes down.”\r\n\r\n_Hark! The rattle!_ Those opaque eyes shuttered back. Those yellow\r\nglances, though in mortal pain, were still furious and glistening.\r\nThose horny tail-bells clattered. Fangs in that shattered, insensate\r\nhead yawned, closing in Red Roane’s arm above the wrist.\r\n\r\nI see him. Sweat upon his broad brown forehead; his laughing eyes\r\nastounded; his thick strong body shivering; wind stirring up his dark\r\nred hair. Behind him the brown-green marshes, grasses rippling, a stir\r\ngoing through their depths. His cheeks had never been so red.\r\n\r\nBefore I could move, he unlocked those jaws and hollow fangs, gripped\r\nhard in his arm with mortal rigor. He shivered now from the knees. His\r\nface went white.\r\n\r\n“Cut!” he whispered. “I’ll sit down.”\r\n\r\nWith hunting knife I slashed his arm, deep driving four crossed\r\ncuts. He laughed, and tried to shout. Howling would have been more\r\npleasant. I sucked those wounds, out of which slow blood was spouting\r\nfrom an artery. We panted now, both of us. He leaned heavily on my\r\nshoulder--he, the strong. I bound his arm, my own fingers so numb I\r\nfumbled at the work. Sweat on Red Roane’s face was cold, and cold his\r\nwrists.\r\n\r\nMy arms clung about him. He swayed, almost toppling, clutching at grass\r\nstems with fading laughter. I picked up his marching stock and beat\r\nthat golden, gory thing within the mire. Beat it till clay-white flesh,\r\nand bone and skin were one with the mucky mire of the swamp. But still\r\nits heart ebbed with deep purple pulsing. A smashing blow, and that,\r\ntoo, died.\r\n\r\n“It’s over!” Grimly I flung the bloody stave into the swaying grass.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Jerry,” whispered Red Roane, “it’s nearly over.”\r\n\r\nI could not believe it. Red Roane, the strong man, the shouter, the\r\nsinger, the gay-hearted lover! Is death then, so much stronger than\r\nlife?\r\n\r\n“A woman, Jerry,” he whispered, “in Havana--Dolores! She dances--”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Red, wake up!”\r\n\r\n“Dances at the--”\r\n\r\n“Red! _Red Roane!_ I’m here, boy!”\r\n\r\nOut from the way, whence we had come, faintly I heard a cry. Who wept\r\nthus for the soul departing, sang _paean_ for the dead? Was it wind\r\nover the stagnant grasses? Frail in the solitude, rose that wail again.\r\nThe whimper of new-born life! In the squatter’s hut the child had found\r\nits soul!\r\n\r\n“Dolores!” whispered Red Roane. Beneath that brazen sky he whispered\r\nthe name of love. “Dolores!”\r\n\r\nPast a hundred miles of swamp, past a hundred miles of sea, did\r\nDolores, the dancer, hear him calling her?\r\n\r\n“Dolores!”\r\n\r\nI hope she heard, for he was a lad, though wild.\r\n\r\nWith a throat strangling in sobs, I sang to Red Roane. His eyes were\r\nclosed, yet he heard me. Old campaign songs, songs of the march and the\r\nbivouac. Marchers’ tunes.\r\n\r\nThen he whispered for a lullaby, and, last of all, for a drinking song.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _V._\r\n\r\nBimi Tal had danced up to us--Bimi Tal, daughter of Red Roane and of\r\nDolores, the dancer.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and tossed her dark red hair. Her broad nostrils sucked in\r\nthe hot night wind.\r\n\r\n  “_I am the daughter of the morning!\r\n  I shout, I dance. I laugh away.\r\n  Follow, lover! Hear my warnings.\r\n  I, the laugher, do not stay...._”\r\n\r\n_Stamp! Stamp! Stamp!_ Her body rippled. She cast her eyes at me.\r\n\r\nTain Dirk’s head was rising. His thin, dry, red lips opened wide. His\r\ngolden eyes burned with undying hate. _Tat! tat! tat!_ his fingers\r\ndrummed.\r\n\r\n“In a minute, Jerry,” whispered Bimi Tal, not pausing from her dance.\r\n\r\nHer lovely eyes looked downward, seeing Dirk. She screamed. The music\r\nsilenced. She struck her arm at him, not knowing what she did.\r\n\r\nMad! the Man was mad! His jaw was opened wide. _He bit her arm above\r\nthe wrist._\r\n\r\nBefore the rush of frantic people had fallen over us, I struck his\r\nvenomous face. With both fists, blow on blow. Blood came from his\r\ndamned lips.\r\n\r\nWhat madness had seized him I don’t know. Likely it was memory surging\r\nback through dead life--the venom of the rattler, hate undying. But of\r\nthat, who can say? A strange thing is memory.\r\n\r\nYet I knew for sure that to him, the mad sculptor, born in that hut in\r\nthe hot savannahs, had passed the soul of the dying rattlesnake.\r\n\r\nHands dragged me back from him. I shouted and tore. He quivered,\r\nwounded heavily. His nervous fingers faintly clattered on the table,\r\ndrumming with dreadful music. Police came in.\r\n\r\n“Look!” I shouted to them. “Look at those marks of teeth on Bimi\r\nTal’s wrist. Two deep fangs. _There’s the man who killed Ynecita, the\r\ndancer!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A “Spooky” Tale With a\r\n  Grim Background_\r\n\r\n                                 _The_\r\n                              GHOST GUARD\r\n\r\n                           _By_ BRYAN IRVINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf every one of the sixty guards and officials at Granite River Prison\r\nhad been asked for the name of the most popular guard on the force,\r\nthere would have been sixty answers--“Asa Shores.” If each of the\r\nfifteen hundred convicts in the prison had been asked which guard was\r\nmost disliked by the convicts, fifteen hundred answers would have been\r\nthe same--“Asa Shores!”\r\n\r\nIf some curious person had asked of each convict and each guard, “Who\r\nis considered the most desperate, the hardest, the shrewdest criminal\r\nin the prison?” the answer would have been unanimous, “Malcolm Hulsey,\r\nthe ‘lifer.’”\r\n\r\nTrue, it does not seem reasonable that Asa Shores should be liked\r\nby every guard and official and disliked by every convict. To those\r\nnot familiar with the duties of prison guards it would seem that Asa\r\nShores’ method of handling the convicts, if disapproved of by fifteen\r\nhundred convicts, would surely be disapproved of by at least one of the\r\nsixty guards. But the explanation is simple.\r\n\r\nAsa Shores’ great great-grandfather had followed the prisons as\r\nmariners follow the seas. Then Asa’s grandfather took up the work and\r\nfollowed it, with an iron hand and an inflexible will, until one day\r\na cell-made knife in the hands of a long-time “con” entered his back\r\nat a point where his suspenders crossed, deviating enough to the left\r\nto pierce his heart. Came next Asa Shores’ father, who went down in\r\nattempting to quell the famous Stromberg break of 1895.\r\n\r\nAsa, therefore, his prison methods impelled perhaps by heredity, looked\r\nupon every wearer of gray behind the walls as a convict, nothing more,\r\nnothing less. He neither abused or favored any convict. A one-year man\r\nwas to Asa a convict and no better than the man who was serving a life\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nThe crime for which any convict was sent up was of little moment to\r\nAsa; neither did he bother about who among the inmates were considered\r\ndesperate. The fact that a man wore prison gray was sufficient, whether\r\nhe be a six-months sneak-thief or a ninety-nine-year murderer.\r\n\r\nWhen Asa shot and killed Richard (“Mutt”) Allison, when the latter\r\nattempted to escape, the warden had said:\r\n\r\n“There was really no need of killing that half-witted short-termer,\r\nAsa. He was doing only a year and was perfectly harmless. A shot in the\r\nleg or foot would have been better.”\r\n\r\nAnd Asa’s reply had been:\r\n\r\n“I had no idea who the man was, though I have seen him dozens of times,\r\nand I did not know how long he was doing. But I would have made no\r\ndifference if I had known. He was a convict, sir, and he was attempting\r\nto escape. If he was only half-witted, as you say, he should have been\r\nin the insane asylum, not in the penitentiary.”\r\n\r\nSo that was that.\r\n\r\nIf Asa ever gave a convict a smile it had never been recorded. It is a\r\nknown fact that he was never seen to frown upon a convict. He was, in\r\nshort, the smileless, unyielding personification of “duty,” and every\r\nconvict hated him for what he was. When Asa shot he shot to kill--and\r\nhe never missed. Four little white crosses on the bleak hillside near\r\nthe prison proclaimed his flawless marksmanship.\r\n\r\nWhy was this big sandy-haired, steel-blue-eyed, middle-aged Asa Shores\r\nliked by his brother guards? There were many reasons why. It was as if\r\nAsa’s unnatural, cold, vigilant, unfeeling attitude toward the convicts\r\nwas offset each day when he came off duty by a healthy, wholesome\r\ndesire to drop duty as a work-horse sheds an irritating harness. He was\r\nthe life of the guards’ quarters; a big good-natured, playful fellow,\r\nwho thoroughly enjoyed a practical joke, whether he be the victim of\r\nthe joke or the instigator. If he had a temper he had never allowed it\r\nto come to the surface. He excelled in all sports in the gymnasium, and\r\nsomewhere, somehow, he found more funny stories than any other man on\r\nthe force. The trite old saying that “he would give a friend the shirt\r\noff his back” fitted him like a new kid glove. He gave freely to his\r\nfriends, and, in giving, seemed to find real joy.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve years’ service on the guardline, Asa was still an ordinary\r\nwall guard. This would seem discouraging to many; but not so to Asa. It\r\nwas not generally known that he drew a larger salary than did the other\r\nwall guards. He was an excellent wall guard. Hence, he was kept on the\r\nwall, while newer men on the force were promoted to better positions.\r\nBut Asa drew the salary of a shift captain and was therefore content.\r\n\r\nHe did not even seem to mind when he was taken from comfortable Tower\r\nNumber One, morning shift, and detailed permanently to Tower Number\r\nThree on the “graveyard” shift at night from eight P. M. to four A. M.\r\nThis change was deemed necessary for several reasons. First, because\r\nAsa positively refused to discriminate between short-termers and\r\nlong-termers, or desperate men and harmless “nuts,” when using his\r\nrifle to stop a “break” or the attempt of a single convict to escape.\r\n\r\nThe men being locked in their cells at night, Asa, as a night guard,\r\nwould have little opportunity to practice rifle shooting with a running\r\nconvict as the target. Another reason for detailing him to Tower Number\r\nThree was because trouble was expected some night at that point in the\r\nyard, and with sure-fire Asa on the job the officials felt that any\r\nattempt of the convicts to escape would be promptly frustrated.\r\n\r\nOne of Asa’s wholesome habits, when no convicts were near him, was\r\nsinging. It was not singing, really, but Asa thought it was and he\r\nshortened the long, lonesome hours at night on Tower Number Three with\r\nsongs--_song_, rather, because he knew and sang but one. It was not a\r\nlate or popular song, and, as Asa sang it, it sounded like the frogs\r\nthat croak in the marshes at night:\r\n\r\n    “_When I die and am buried deep,\r\n    “I’ll return at night to take a peep\r\n    “At those who hated me.\r\n    “I’ll ha’nt their homes and spoil their sleep,\r\n    “Chill their blood; the skin will creep\r\n    “On those who hated me._”\r\n\r\nNot a pretty song; nor did it make cheerful those guards who passed\r\nnear Tower Number Three while making the night rounds. But Asa loved\r\nthat song.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was while the wall was being extended another two hundred feet to\r\nmake room within the inclosure for a new cell house that Asa shot the\r\n“lifer,” Malcolm Hulsey.\r\n\r\nThe end wall, extending from Tower Number Three to Tower Number Four,\r\nhad been torn down and the stones moved two hundred feet farther south\r\nto be used on the new wall. A temporary barbed-wire fence had been\r\nerected about the area in which the convicts worked on the new wall.\r\nExtra armed guards were stationed at intervals of fifty feet outside\r\nthe inclosure to guard the working convicts.\r\n\r\nMalcolm Hulsey had successfully feigned illness one day and was allowed\r\nto remain in his cell. Cell house guards had seen him lying in his\r\nbunk, only the top of his head showing above the blankets. At lock-up\r\ntime the cell house guards making the count, saw a foot protruding from\r\nunder the blankets in Hulsey’s bunk and what they believed to be the\r\ntop of his head showing at the head of the bed.\r\n\r\nAt ten-fifteen that night the eagle-eyed Asa Shores, on Tower Number\r\nThree, saw a dark figure slip under the lower wire of the temporary\r\nfence and run. Asa fired once and saw the man fall.\r\n\r\nThen Asa, to comply with the prison rules, yelled “halt!” The command,\r\nof course, was needless, Hulsey having halted abruptly when a\r\nthirty-thirty rifle ball plowed through his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAfter the convict had been carried to the hospital, his cell was opened\r\nby the curious guards. A cleverly carved wooden foot protruded from\r\nunder the blankets at the foot of the bed, several bags of old clothing\r\nreposed under the blankets and a thatch of black horse-hair showed at\r\nthe head of the bed.\r\n\r\nBefore Hulsey left the hospital the new wall was completed. Tower\r\nNumber Four, across from Tower Number Three, had been torn down and a\r\nnew Tower Number Four built on the new corner of the wall, two hundred\r\nfeet farther south. On the other corner, across from New Tower Number\r\nFour, was New Tower Number Three. Old Tower Number Three was left\r\nstanding until further orders. Asa Shores remained on the graveyard\r\nshift on Old Tower Number Three.\r\n\r\nWhile off duty one day Asa, prowling about inside the walls, met\r\nMalcolm Hulsey. The “lifer” was still a bit pale and weak from the\r\ngunshot wound.\r\n\r\n“One thing I’d like to have you explain, Mr. Shores,” said Hulsey. “You\r\nplugged me in the shoulder, then yelled ‘halt!’ Why didn’t you command\r\nme to stop before firing?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was this way, Hulsey,” Asa replied, unsmiling and looking the\r\nconvict squarely in the eye. “I aimed at the spot where I calculated\r\nyour heart ought to be, but the light was poor and I had to shoot\r\nquick. I naturally supposed you were dead when I commanded you to halt,\r\nand, believing you dead, I could see no reason for being in a hurry\r\nwith the command. Sorry I bungled the job that way, but my intentions\r\nwere good.”\r\n\r\n“But,” the scowling “lifer” persisted, “you haven’t told me yet why you\r\nshot before commanding me to halt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that?” Asa drawled with a deprecatory shrug of his massive\r\nshoulders. “That is merely a matter of form with me. I very often,\r\nafter shooting a convict, yell ‘halt’ some time the next day--or week.\r\nBesides, if you had a nice chance to bump me off, you wouldn’t say,\r\n‘Beware, Mr. Shores, I’m about to kill you.’”\r\n\r\nFor a half minute convict and keeper gazed into each others eyes.\r\n\r\n“I get yuh,” Hulsey finally said. “And I guess you’re right. I have an\r\nidear though that my turn comes next, Mr. Shores; and there’ll be no\r\npreliminary command or argument.”\r\n\r\n“Fair enough, Hulsey,” Asa replied as he turned away.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last the big new cell house was completed.\r\n\r\nAsa wondered whether he would be left on Old Tower Number Three. It had\r\nbeen decided, he knew, that the old tower would be left on the wall but\r\nperhaps not used.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the completion of the new building, the warden declared a\r\nholiday and issued orders that all the inmates be given the privilege\r\nof the yard that day. There was to be wrestling, boxing, foot-racing\r\nand other sports.\r\n\r\nAsa Shores’ sleeping quarters was a low-ceilinged room on the ground\r\nfloor in one of the towers of the old cell house. Asa had been warned a\r\nnumber of times that his room was not a safe place to sleep in the day\r\ntime. Convicts in the yard could enter the room at any time during the\r\nday, without being seen by the yard guards or wall guards. Though the\r\none door to the room was thick and heavy, Asa seldom if ever locked it.\r\n\r\nAsa had risen in the afternoon, complaining to himself about the noise\r\nbeing made by the convicts in the yard. His peevishness vanished,\r\nhowever, after a cold wash, and he sang as he stood looking out at one\r\nof the windows and brushing his hair:\r\n\r\n    “_When I die and am buried deep,\r\n    “I’ll return at night to take a peep\r\n    “At those who hated me.\r\n    “I’ll ha’nt their homes and spoil their sleep,\r\n    “Chill their blood, the skin will creep,\r\n    “On those who--_”\r\n\r\nAsa’s song ended there--ended in a horrible gurgle. A “trusty” found\r\nhim an hour later lying in a pool of blood near the open window.\r\n\r\nHis throat had been cut by a sharp instrument in the hand of a person\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nHulsey the “lifer” was questioned, of course, but there was absolutely\r\nnothing to indicate that it was he who committed the murder.\r\n\r\nThe guards looked sadly upon all that remained of Asa Shores and said\r\nto each other in hushed voices:\r\n\r\n“It had to come. Asa was too good a convict guard not to be murdered.”\r\n\r\nAnd though the prison stool pigeons kept their ears and eyes opened,\r\nthough each guard became a detective, the murder of Asa Shores remained\r\na mystery.\r\n\r\nOld Tower Number Three was closed and the doors locked. There was no\r\nimmediate use for it; but the warden was contemplating the advisability\r\nof having another guards’ entrance gate cut through the wall under the\r\ntower. In this case, of course, the tower would be used again.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNight Captain Jesse Dunlap sat alone in the guards’ lookout, inside\r\nthe walls, at one o’clock on the morning following the murder of Asa\r\nShores. Bill Wilton, the night yard guard, was making his round about\r\nthe buildings in the yard.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunlap lazily watched the brass indicators on the report board\r\nbefore him. The indicator for Tower Number One made a half turn to\r\nthe left and a small bell on the board rang. The captain lifted the\r\nreceiver from the telephone at his elbow and received the report,\r\n“Tower Number One. Anderson on duty. All O. K.”\r\n\r\nDunlap merely grunted a response and replaced the receiver on the hook.\r\nPresently the indicator for Tower Number Two turned to the left, the\r\nbell tinkled, and Dunlap again took the receiver from the hook.\r\n\r\n“Tower Number Two. Briggs on duty. All O. K.” came the report over the\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nThen came New Tower Number Three; next Tower Number Four. From the\r\nthree outside guard-posts came the reports, and one from the cell\r\nhouse, each guard turning in his post number, his name and the usual\r\n“O. K.”\r\n\r\nAll the indicators on the board, except that for Old Tower Number\r\nThree, were now turned. Captain Dunlap relaxed in his chair, sighed\r\nheavily and lit his pipe. Lazily his eyes wandered back to the\r\nindicator board.\r\n\r\nThe unturned indicator for Old Tower Number Three held his gaze and\r\nutter sadness gripped him for a moment. Night after night, promptly on\r\nthe hour, he had seen the indicator for Old Tower Number Three flip\r\njauntily to the left and had heard the tinkle of the little bell on the\r\nboard. It had always seemed to him that the indicator for Asa Shores’\r\ntower turned with more pep than the other indicators, that the bell had\r\ntinkled more cheerily, that good old Asa Shores’ report carried a note\r\nof cheerfulness that lightened the lonesome watches of the night.\r\n\r\nNow the old tower was cold, even as poor old Asa was cold; the doors\r\nwere locked and barred. Never again, thought Dunlap, would be heard Asa\r\nShores’ familiar song on the quiet night air. What were the words to\r\nthat song?\r\n\r\n  “_When I am dead and buried deep,\r\n  “I’ll return at night to take a peep\r\n  “At those who hated--_”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunlap suddenly sat erect in his chair. The pipe fell from his\r\nlips and clattered on the floor, as his lower jaw dropped and his eyes\r\nopened wide to stare at the indicator board; for--\r\n\r\nThe indicator for Old Tower Number Three was moving--moving, not with\r\na quick turn to the left, but in a hesitant, jerky way that caused the\r\nroot of every hair on Captain Dunlap’s head to tingle. Never before\r\nhad the captain seen an indicator behave like that. In fact, the\r\nindicator system was designed and constructed in such a way that, being\r\ncontrolled by electric contacts, the various indicators would snap into\r\nposition when a push button in each tower was pressed by the guard on\r\nduty in that tower.\r\n\r\nIn short, an indicator, in accordance with all the rules of electricity\r\nas applied to the system, must remain stationary or jerk to the left\r\nwhen the button in the tower was pressed. But here was indicator for\r\nOld Tower Number Three wavering, trembling to the left, only to fall\r\nback repeatedly to a vertical position. Then again, jerkily, hesitantly\r\nto the left, as if a vagrant soul strove to brush aside the veil that\r\nbanished it from the living.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunlap sat rigid and watched the uncanny movements of the\r\nbright brass indicator. Vague, fleeting, chaotic thoughts of crossed\r\nwires, practical jokers, wandering souls tumbled one after another\r\nthrough his brain.\r\n\r\nIf only the bell would not tinkle! If it did ring? Well, death then,\r\nthough it had taken away what was mortal of Asa Shores, had not\r\nconquered his eternal vigilance and strict attention to duty.\r\n\r\nFarther to the left wavered the indicator, hesitatingly, uncertainly,\r\nthen--_the bell rang_!\r\n\r\nA weak, slow ring, it was, that sounded strange and unnatural in the\r\ndeathlike silence of the dimly lighted lookout.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunlap was a brave man. He had smilingly faced death a dozen\r\ntimes in Granite River Prison.\r\n\r\nBut always his danger was known to be from living, breathing men.\r\nAbject terror gripped him now; a nameless terror that seemed to freeze\r\nthe blood in his veins, contract every muscle and nerve of his body,\r\nsmother his heart.\r\n\r\nBut even then reasoning struggled for recognition in his mind. What\r\nif it were a part of Asa Shores, a part of him that remained on earth\r\nto defy death and carry on? Hasn’t Asa always been Captain Dunlap’s\r\nfriend? Why should he fear the spirit of a friend?\r\n\r\nDunlap reached forth a trembling hand, took the receiver from the hook\r\nand slowly, reluctantly, placed it to his ear. How he wished, hoped,\r\nprayed that no voice would come over the wire!\r\n\r\nBut it did come, preceded by a faint whispering sound:\r\n\r\n“Old t-t-t-tow--” a long pause, then weakly, almost inaudibly,\r\nas if the message came from a million miles away--“Old t-t-tower\r\nn-n-n--three. S-S-Sho--”\r\n\r\nAnother pause, a jumble of meaningless words, then a chuckle. God!\r\nAsa’s familiar chuckle!\r\n\r\n“On duty. All O-O--all O--”\r\n\r\nA light laugh, a sharp buzzing sound, a sigh, the faint tinkle of a\r\nbell, then silence!\r\n\r\nDunlap heard no click of a receiver being replaced on a hook. The line\r\nwas apparently still open.\r\n\r\nStill holding the receiver to his ear, the captain moistened his dry\r\nlips with the tip of his tongue. His free hand went involuntarily to\r\nhis forehead in a vague uncertain gesture and came away damp with\r\nperspiration. Must he answer that ghost call? Must he speak to the\r\n_thing_ that held the line.\r\n\r\nWhen he at last spoke his voice was husky, a strange voice even to him:\r\n\r\n“Who--who did it, Asa? Who--who--if you are dead--if this is you, Asa,\r\ntell me--_who did it_.”\r\n\r\nAgain that queer, unfamiliar buzzing sound. Then, from Old Tower Number\r\nThree, or from beyond the grave perhaps, came a faint, whispering,\r\nuncertain voice:\r\n\r\n“He--he--it was....”\r\n\r\nThe voice ended in a gurgle.\r\n\r\nDunlap replaced the receiver on the hook, and as he did so his eyes\r\nrested on the indicator board and he gasped sharply; for the indicator\r\nfor Old Tower Number Three went wavering, trembling back to a vertical\r\nposition on the time dial!\r\n\r\nThis unheard-of behavior of the indicator was the deepest mystery of\r\nall. The indicators, each controlled independent of the others by push\r\nbuttons in each tower, were constructed mechanically to turn only from\r\nright to left.\r\n\r\nThe indicator for Old Tower Number Three had _turned back from left to\r\nright_!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunlap made no effort to solve the mystery.\r\n\r\nOld Tower Number Three was securely locked and could not be approached\r\nexcept by crossing over the wall from New Tower Number Three on the\r\nSoutheast corner of the wall, or from Tower Number Two on the Northeast\r\ncorner of the wall. Dunlap himself had closed and locked the doors and\r\nwindows of the tower. There was but one key to the tower doors, and\r\nthat key was in Dunlap’s pocket.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other towers, Old Tower Number Three could not be entered\r\nfrom the ground outside the wall. It was built solidly of stone from\r\nthe ground up, and the only entrances were the two doors communicating\r\nwith the top of the wall on either side of the tower.\r\n\r\nBesides, strict orders had been given that no one enter the tower\r\nunless ordered there by a shift captain. And, too, in the glare of the\r\narc lights near the wall, it would be impossible for anyone to cross\r\nthe wall to the tower, without being seen by other wall guards.\r\n\r\nCould the mysterious report have come from one of the other wall\r\ntowers? Impossible for this reason: When the push button in one of the\r\nwall towers--say, that in Old Tower Number Three--was pressed by the\r\nman on duty there, the indicator on the board in the captain’s lookout\r\nturned to the left a quarter-turn on the time dial, the small bell on\r\nthe board rang and all telephone connections with the other wall towers\r\nwere automatically cut off until the captain had replaced the telephone\r\nreceiver on the hook after receiving the report from Old Tower Number\r\nThree.\r\n\r\nDunlap said nothing to Bill Wilton when the latter returned to the\r\nyard lookout, after making his round in the yard. It would be best, he\r\nreasoned, to say nothing to anybody about the mysterious call. They\r\nwould only laugh at him if he told them about it. If the indicator had\r\nnot returned to a vertical position on the time dial he would have\r\nsome proof on which to base his wild story of the ghost call. But the\r\nindicator had, before his own eyes, returned to its former position\r\nafter the call.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, at two A.M., Dunlap fearfully watched the indicator for\r\nOld Tower Number Three. Reports from all other posts had been received.\r\nThen, just once, the indicator trembled uncertainly, made almost a\r\nquarter turn to the left and snapped back to a vertical position. At\r\nthree o’clock it did not move. Nor did it move at four o’clock.\r\n\r\nA week passed. Not a tremor disturbed the “ghost tower” indicator.\r\n\r\nThen, one morning at one-thirty o’clock, an unearthly, piercing scream\r\nin the cell house awaked half the men in the building and sent the\r\ncell house guard scurrying down to cell twenty-one on the corridor; for\r\nit was from this cell that the blood-chilling scream had come.\r\n\r\nThe bloodless, perspiration-dampened face of Malcolm Hulsey, the\r\n“lifer,” was pressed against the bars of the cell door when the\r\nguard arrived. The convict’s great hands grasped the bars and his\r\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty-pound bulk, clad in only a regulation undershirt,\r\ntwitched, started and trembled from head to foot. A horrible fear\r\ndistended his eyes, his teeth clicked together and the muscles of his\r\nface worked spasmodically.\r\n\r\n“Sick, Hulsey?” the guard demanded, hardened to such nerve-shattering\r\noutbursts in a building full of tortured souls.\r\n\r\n“I saw--I saw--” Hulsey began, his teeth chattering and rendering\r\nspeech well-nigh impossible. “I saw--Oh, Mr. Hill, please give me a\r\ncellmate--_now, tonight!_ I--I’m a sick man, Mr. Hill. Nerves all shot\r\nto pieces, I guess. Can’t I have a cellmate to talk to, Mr. Hill?”\r\n\r\n“What did you see?” the guard asked.\r\n\r\n“He was standing right where you are now,” Hulsey whispered hoarsely.\r\n“Pointing his finger at me, he was, when I opened my eyes and saw him.\r\nSmiling, too. I--I”--a violent shudder--“I could _see through him_, Mr.\r\nHill; could see the bars on that window beyond him. I--”\r\n\r\n“Who? See who?” the guard interrupted.\r\n\r\nHulsey seemed to realize, then, that he was talking too much; that he\r\nwas not conducting himself as the hardest convict in the prison should.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he stammered. “I saw--I _thought_ I saw--an old pal o’ mine.\r\nHe’s been dead a long time. Nerves, I guess. Thinking too much about my\r\nold pal and the good old days. Nightmare, I guess.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah--nightmare is right!” the unsympathetic guard growled. “But don’t\r\nlet another blat like that out of you, or we’ll throw you into a padded\r\ncell. Got the whole wing stirred up. Get to bed now and forget that\r\ngood old pal of yours.”\r\n\r\n“If I only could!” Hulsey whispered huskily to himself, as he got back\r\ninto the bunk.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo weeks passed.\r\n\r\nThere were no more outbursts from cell twenty-one. The “ghost tower” on\r\nthe wall was silent, cold.\r\n\r\nThen, at two o’clock one morning, Captain Dunlap saw the indicator\r\nmove. It sickened him, made him wish ardently that he was a thousand\r\nmiles from Granite River Prison.\r\n\r\nThe indicator moved slowly, hesitantly, to the left and the bell\r\ntinkled weakly. The captain placed the receiver to his ear, but no\r\nsound came; the line was dead. The indicator fell back to its original\r\nposition as the captain replaced the receiver on the crotch.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the yard guard entered the lookout. Bill Wilton,\r\nthe regular yard guard on the graveyard shift, was away on leave and\r\nthe substitute guard was new at the prison.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I understand you to say, Mr. Dunlap,” the new guard said, “that\r\nthere was no one on Old Tower Number Three?”\r\n\r\n“You sure did,” Dunlap answered.\r\n\r\nThe guard pulled his left ear and looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Funny,” he finally remarked. “Was sure I heard somebody in that tower,\r\nsinging soft and low like, when I passed under it a few minutes ago.”\r\n\r\n“What was he singing?” the captain asked, bending forward and fixing a\r\npenetrating gaze on the recent arrival at the prison.\r\n\r\n“Let me see now,” said the guard meditatively. “Couldn’t make out much\r\nof the song. Something about ‘when I die in the ocean deep,’--No, that\r\nwasn’t it. ‘When I die and am buried deep’--that’s it. Then there was\r\nsomething in it about this dead guy coming back to ha’nt people, and a\r\nlot of bunk like that.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Dunlap, as he eased himself out of the chair. “I’m going\r\nup and have a look around in that tower. You stay in here until I\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\nDunlap went outside the walls and up through New Tower Number Three,\r\nwhere he questioned Guard Jim Humphrey. Humphrey had not seen or heard\r\nanything unusual in or about Old Tower Number Three.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunlap, as he walked over the wall toward the ghost tower,\r\nadmitted frankly to himself that he was “scared stiff.” Pausing at the\r\ndoor, he glanced nervously through the window.\r\n\r\nThe yard lights lit up the interior of the tower sufficiently to assure\r\nhim that no one--or “thing”--was inside. He unlocked the door and\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nWith a flashlight, he thoroughly examined the telephone. Dust had\r\nsettled on the instrument. The receiver and the transmitter had\r\napparently not been touched since Asa Shores left the tower. Dust had\r\nsettled on the doorknobs inside. That the knobs had not been touched\r\nsince Shores’ death was obvious. The one chair, the window-sills,\r\nthe small washstand and wash basin, all were covered with a thin,\r\nundisturbed film of fine dust.\r\n\r\nThere on the telephone battery box reposed Asa’s old corncob pipe and,\r\nnear it, a small box of matches. The window latches were just as Dunlap\r\nhad left them when he closed and securely locked the tower a month\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt was a puzzled and nervous prison official that left the tower,\r\nrelocked the doors and returned to the inside lookout.\r\n\r\nNext day Malcolm Hulsey, the “lifer” was admitted to the hospital. The\r\ndoctor’s diagnosis was “nervous breakdown.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Hulsey, though his nerves were all shot to pieces, was still\r\ncapable of shrewd plotting.\r\n\r\nHis admittance to the hospital had been hastened by a diet of soap.\r\nHulsey was so anxious to get far away from Granite River Prison, and\r\nwas so certain of his ability to do so if he could only be admitted to\r\nthe hospital, that he had resorted to the old but effective expedient\r\nof soap eating.\r\n\r\nSoap, taken internally in small doses, will produce various baffling\r\nand apparently serious physiological changes in the body. Hulsey looked\r\nsick and felt sick, but he was not dangerously ill.\r\n\r\nFor many months Malcolm Hulsey had been watching closely the movements\r\nof the night guards. During his stay in the hospital, while recovering\r\nfrom the gunshot wound in his shoulder he had “doped out” a possible\r\nmeans of escape, and he was on the point of making the attempt when\r\nthe doctor pronounced him sufficiently recovered to be returned to the\r\ncell house.\r\n\r\nThe “lifer’s” plan of escape was simply this: At midnight, while\r\nCaptain Dunlap and his crew were on duty, the yard guard made his\r\nround, counted the patients in the hospital and left the yard through\r\nthe guards’ gate to eat his lunch in the guards’ dining-room outside\r\nthe walls. When the yard guard returned to the inside lookout he\r\ncarried with him a hot lunch for Captain Dunlap.\r\n\r\nIn counting the men in the hospital, the yard guard did not as a rule\r\nenter the building. He merely turned on the lights in the one large\r\nward and looked through the window. The convict hospital nurse on night\r\nduty stood ready, and when the lights were turned on, proceeded from\r\nbed to bed and partly uncovered each patient so that the yard guard\r\noutside could see and count them.\r\n\r\nThere were several factors in Hulsey’s favor now, one being that a new\r\nsubstitute guard was on duty over the guards’ entrance gate during the\r\nabsence of the regular guard who was away on vacation. There was only\r\none patient in the hospital besides Hulsey. The yard guard must be\r\nlured into the hospital, overpowered, his uniform stripped from him,\r\nthen Hulsey, garbed in the uniform, would attempt to deceive the guard\r\nat the gate and be given the keys.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen minutes to midnight, on Hulsey’s first day in the hospital,\r\nthe “lifer” quietly rose from his bed while the white-clad convict\r\nnurse’s back was turned. Three minutes later the unsuspecting nurse had\r\nbeen neatly laid out from a well-directed blow behind the ear, bound\r\nwith sheets, gagged, stripped of his white suit and tenderly tucked in\r\nthe bed recently occupied by Mr. Malcolm Hulsey.\r\n\r\nThe other patient, a feeble old convict, was gagged and tied down in\r\nhis bed with sheets. Hulsey then donned the nurse’s white suit and,\r\nafter arranging the nurse and the old convict in their beds so that\r\nthey appeared to be sleeping peacefully, the “lifer” lay face down on\r\nthe floor and awaited developments.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o’clock the new guard appeared at the hospital window and\r\nswitched on the lights. Having counted the men in the hospital every\r\nhour since eight o’clock, the guard intended now to give the patients\r\na hasty glance and proceed to the gate. There were his two patients,\r\napparently sleeping peacefully. But where was the nurse?\r\n\r\nHulsey’s heart pounded like a riveting hammer as he lay sprawled on\r\nthe floor. Would the ruse work? Would the guard enter the hospital\r\nto investigate, or would he report to Captain Dunlap when he saw the\r\nwhite-clad figure on the floor?\r\n\r\nThe guard’s eyes then rested on the man on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” he ejaculated. “Funny place for nursie to be sleeping!”\r\n\r\nBut the nurse’s sprawled form did not indicate slumber. The guard was\r\npuzzled. Perhaps the nurse had fainted, or fallen and hurt himself. The\r\nguard tapped on the window with a key. No answer, no movement of nurse\r\nor patients.\r\n\r\nThen the unsuspecting “screw” unlocked the door and entered. An older\r\nguard would have reported to the Captain. He was in the act of bending\r\nover to turn the pseudo-nurse upon his back when his ankles were\r\nsuddenly seized and his feet perked from under him.\r\n\r\nThe guard’s head struck an iron bedstead as he fell, thus relieving\r\nHulsey of the unpleasant job of beating him into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes later the “lifer,” wearing the guard’s uniform, boldly\r\napproached the gate.\r\n\r\n“What’s on the menu tonight, Frank?” Hulsey casually asked, pulling his\r\nhat further down over his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Same old thing--hash,” the gate guard answered, as he lowered the keys.\r\n\r\nThough the suspense, anxiety and uncertainty were terrible, Hulsey\r\nwhistled calmly as he unlocked the first gate. The large bull lock\r\non the outside gate was not so easily unlocked. Hulsey fumbled, his\r\nhands shook, his whistling, in spite of all he could do to keep it up,\r\nwheezed, went off key, then died in a discordant wail.\r\n\r\n“Say!” the gate guard suddenly blurted. “Look up here! By cracky, your\r\nactions don’t look good to me.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHulsey did not look up. He gave the key another frantic twist, and the\r\nlock opened.\r\n\r\nIn that short space of time the wall guard had raced into the lookout\r\nand seized a shotgun. As he stepped to the door of the lookout, a dark\r\nfigure disappeared around the corner of a building twenty feet from the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nA moment later the alarm in the guards’ quarters rang frantically, and\r\na dozen sleepy-eyed men tumbled from their beds, slipped on shoes and\r\ntrousers and ran out into the yard.\r\n\r\nThe gate guard could only tell where he last saw the escaping convict.\r\nTo capture the man on such a dark night seemed hopeless, considering,\r\ntoo, that the fleeing man had a seven-minute start. However, the\r\nhalf-dressed guards scattered and made for a heavy willow thicket\r\nseveral hundred yards beyond the spot where the convict was last seen.\r\n\r\nFor five minutes after the pursuing guards disappeared in the darkness,\r\nsilence reigned over the prison. Then--\r\n\r\nFrom a distant point in the dark thicket a hair-raising, half-animal,\r\nhalf-human shriek of mortal terror shattered the stillness of the night\r\nand echoed and re-echoed about the high prison walls.\r\n\r\nWhite faced guards, temporarily unnerved by that fearful wail, crashed\r\nthrough the brush, their flashlights playing about like the eyes of\r\nspending demons. Then they found Malcolm Hulsey the “lifer.”\r\n\r\nGroveling face down in the mud of a little creek bank, hands clutching\r\nat empty air, great spasms of maniacal terror passing through his\r\nbody, the one time terror of the prison muttered insane, incoherent\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nTwo guards pulled him to his knees. Others turned flashlights on his\r\nface--a face such as is seen in horrible nightmares; a ghastly face,\r\npartly covered with black mud; an avid face where it shown through the\r\ngrime. The eyes were wide, protruding, glassy.\r\n\r\n“_See! See!_” the convict rasped hoarsely, pointing a mud-smeared hand\r\nat a dense black nook in the thicket. “_See!_ He stands there and\r\npoints at me--and laughs! _It’s Asa Shores!_ He’s been in my cell every\r\nnight for weeks--laughing at me! He sang a death song to me--always\r\nsang--always laughed! Wouldn’t let me sleep! _He’s coming toward me!\r\nStop him!_ Please--”\r\n\r\nThen another horrible shriek, a shudder, a gasp, and the guards dropped\r\nthe lifeless form of Malcolm Hulsey in the mud.\r\n\r\nBy some queer whim of fate, the speechless guards involuntarily\r\nswitched off their flashlights. Utter darkness, utter silence enveloped\r\nthem. Then a faint sound was heard.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” came the hoarse voice of Guard Jerry Clark. “Do you hear it?”\r\n\r\nVery little of it could be heard. It was a faint sound and growing\r\nfainter.\r\n\r\n  “_When I die and am buried deep,\r\n  I’ll return at night to_ ...”\r\n\r\nThen it was gone, and all was still again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Here’s An Extraordinary Yarn--_\r\n\r\n                           _The_ Ghoul _and\r\n                              the_ Corpse\r\n\r\n                           _By_ G. A. WELLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Chris Bonner’s tale, not mine. Please remember that.\r\n\r\nI positively will not stand sponsor for it. I used to have a deal of\r\nfaith in Chris Bonner’s veracity, but that is a thing of the past. He\r\nis a liar; a liar without conscience. I as good as told him so to his\r\nface. I wonder what kind of fool he thinks I am!\r\n\r\nAttend, now, and you shall hear that remarkable tale he told me. It\r\nwas, and is, a lie. I shall always think so.\r\n\r\nHe came marching into my igloo up there at Aurora Bay. That is in\r\nAlaska, you know, on the Arctic sea. I had been in the back-country\r\ntrading for pelts for a New York concern, and due to bad luck I\r\ndidn’t reach the coast until the third day after the last steamer out\r\nhad gone. And there I was marooned for the winter, without chance\r\nof getting out until spring, with a few dozen ignorant Indians for\r\ncompanions. Thank heaven I had plenty of white man’s grub in tins!\r\n\r\nAs I said, here came Chris Bonner marching in on me the same as you\r\nwould go down the block a few doors to call on a neighbor.\r\n\r\n“And where the devil did you drop in from?” I demanded, helping him off\r\nwith his stiff parka.\r\n\r\n“Down there,” he answered, jerking an elbow toward the south. “Let’s\r\nhave something to eat, MacNeal. I’m hungry as hell. Look at the pack,\r\nwill you!”\r\n\r\nI had already looked at the pack he had cast off his shoulders to the\r\nfur-covered floor of the igloo. It was as lean as a starved hound. I\r\nheated a can of beef bouillon and some beans, and made a pot of coffee\r\nover the blubber-fat fire that served for both heat and light, and\r\nput these and some crackers before my guest. He tore into his meal\r\nwolfishly.\r\n\r\n“Now a pipe and some tobac, MacNeal,” he ordered, pushing the empty\r\ndishes aside.\r\n\r\nI gave him one of my pipes and my tobacco-pouch. He filled and lighted\r\nup. He seemed to relish the smoke; I imagined he hadn’t had one for\r\nsome time. He sat silent for a while staring into the flickering flame.\r\n\r\n“Say, MacNeal,” he spoke at length; “what do you know about a theory\r\nthat says once on a time this old world of ours revolved on its axis in\r\na different plane? I’ve heard it said the earth tipped up about seventy\r\ndegrees. What d’you know about it?”\r\n\r\nThat was a queer thing for Chris Bonner to ask. He was simon-pure\r\nprospector and I had never known him to get far away from the subject\r\nof mining and prospecting. He had been hunting gold from Panama to the\r\nArctic Circle for the past thirty years.\r\n\r\n“No more than you do, probably,” I answered his question. “I’ve heard\r\nof that theory, too. I’d say it is any man’s guess.”\r\n\r\n“This theory holds that the North Pole used to be where the Equator is\r\nnow,” he said. “Do you believe that?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about it, Chris,” I replied. “But I do know that\r\nthey have found things up this way that are now generally recognized as\r\nbeing peculiarly tropical in nature.”\r\n\r\n“What, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Palms and ferns, a species of parrot, saber-tooth tigers; and also\r\nmastodons, members of the elephant family. All fossils and parts of\r\nskeletons, you understand.”\r\n\r\n“No human beings, MacNeal? Any skeletons or fossils of those up this\r\nway?”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of it. Prehistoric people are being found in England and\r\nFrance, however.”\r\n\r\n“Huh,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe pondered, puffing at his pipe, his eyes on the fire. He looked\r\nperplexed about something.\r\n\r\n“Look here, MacNeal,” he said suddenly. “Say a man dies. He’s dead,\r\nain’t he?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt of it,” I laughed, wondering.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t come to life again, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly. Not if he were really dead. I’ve heard of cases of suspended\r\nanimation. The heart, apparently, quits beating for one, two or\r\npossibly ten minutes. It doesn’t in fact, though; it’s simply that its\r\nbeating can’t be detected. When a man’s heart stops beating he’s dead.”\r\n\r\nBonner nodded.\r\n\r\n“‘Suspended animation,’” he muttered, more to himself than to me. “That\r\nmust be it. That’s the only thing that’ll explain it; nothing else\r\nwill. If it could cover a period of ten minutes, why not a period of\r\ntwenty or even a hundred thousand years--”\r\n\r\n“If you’d like to turn in and get some rest, Chris, I’ll fix you up,” I\r\nbroke in.\r\n\r\nHe caught the significance of my tone and grinned.\r\n\r\n“You think I’m crazy, eh?” he said. “I’m not. It’s a wonder, though,\r\nconsidering what I’ve seen and what I--here, let me show you something!”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe thrust a hand into his lean pack and brought forth an object that at\r\nfirst glance I thought to be a butcher’s knife.\r\n\r\nHe handed it to me and I at once saw that it was not a butcher’s knife\r\nas I knew such knives. It was a curious sort of knife, and one for\r\nwhich a collector of the antique would have paid good money.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark color, almost black; corroded, it seemed to me, as\r\nif it had lain for a long time in a damp cellar. It was in one piece,\r\nthe handle about five inches long and the blade perhaps ten inches.\r\nBoth edges of the blade were sharp and the end was pointed like a\r\ndagger. And it certainly wasn’t steel. I scratched one side of the\r\nblade with my thumb nail and exposed a creamy yellow under the veneer\r\nof black.\r\n\r\n“Part of that’s blood you scraped away, MacNeal,” Bonner said. “Now\r\nwhat’s that knife made of?”\r\n\r\nI examined the yellow spot closely. The knife was made of ivory. Not\r\nthe kind of ivory I was acquainted with, however; it was a very much\r\ncoarser grain than any ivory I had ever seen.\r\n\r\n“That came out of a mastodon’s tusk, MacNeal,” Bonner said.\r\n\r\nI looked at him. He was nodding, seriously. He apparently believed what\r\nhe said, at any rate.\r\n\r\n“Nice curio, Chris,” I commented, handing the thing back to him.\r\n“Heirloom, no doubt. Picked it up in one of the Indian villages, eh?”\r\n\r\nHe did not speak at once. He sat puffing, looking at the fire. Once he\r\npuckered his brows in a deep frown. I waited.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been prospecting, as usual,” he said at length. “Down there\r\naround the headquarters of the Tukuvuk. It’s an awful place; nobody\r\never goes there. The Indians tell me the spirits of the dead live\r\nthere. I can believe it; it’s an ideal place for imps and devils. And I\r\nwas right through the heart of it. I believe I’m the first. No matter\r\nhow I got there; I came up from the south last summer. You see, I had\r\nan idea there was gold in that country.\r\n\r\n“The place where I finally settled down was in a little valley on one\r\nof the branches of the Tukuvuk between two ranges of hills running from\r\nfive hundred to maybe three thousand feet high. Messy-looking place, it\r\nwas; all littered up, as if the Lord had a few sizable chunks of stuff\r\nleft over and just threw ’em down there to be out of the way.\r\n\r\n“But the gold was there; I could almost smell it. I’d been getting\r\nsome mighty nice color in my pan; that’s what made me decide to stay\r\nthere. I got there about the middle of July, and I spent the rest of\r\nthe summer sinking holes in the edge of the creek and along the benches\r\nabove. What I found indicated that there was a mighty rich vein of the\r\nyellow metal thereabouts, with one end of it laying in a pocket of the\r\nstuff. If I could locate that pocket, I thought, I’d have the United\r\nStates treasury backed off the map. But I wasn’t able to run the pocket\r\ndown by taking bearings from my holes, because the holes didn’t line up\r\nin any particular direction.\r\n\r\n“What with my interest in trying to get a line on that pocket, I didn’t\r\nnotice that the season was getting late. But I’d brought in enough grub\r\nto last the winter through, so that didn’t matter. Just the same it\r\nwas up to me to get some sort of shelter over my head, so I hustled up\r\na one-room shack about twelve by twelve I cut from the timber on the\r\nslopes with my hand-ax. Nothing fancy, but tight enough. I put in a\r\nfireplace and cut and stacked a lot of wood outside.\r\n\r\n“That done, winter was on me; I simply couldn’t resist the temptation\r\nto have one more try at finding the pocket that spewed the yellow metal\r\nall around there. As I said, I got no information from the holes sunk,\r\nand it was pure guesswork. I guessed I’d find my pocket on the side of\r\na certain hill, about two hundred feet above creek level. A glacier\r\nflowed down the side of that hill through a little gulley, and my idea\r\nwas that the ice ground away at the pocket and brought the metal down\r\nto the creek, and the creek scattered it. This theory was borne out to\r\nsome extent by the fact that my best showings of color always came from\r\na point a little below the conjunction of the creek and glacier.\r\n\r\n“It was snowing the morning I took my pan and shovel and started up the\r\nside of the hill, keeping to the edge of the glacier. It wasn’t much\r\nof a glacier for size; say, about fifteen feet wide. I could see it\r\nwinding up the side of the hill until it went out of sight through a\r\ncleft about a thousand feet up. Fed by a lake up there, probably.\r\n\r\n“I had climbed the hill maybe a hundred feet, following the edge of\r\nthe glacier, when I caught sight of a dark blotch in the edge of the\r\nice. It was about two feet under the surface. I brushed away the film\r\nof snow to have a look. The ice was as clear as a crystal, of a blue\r\ncolor. And what d’you think, MacNeal? It was a man’s body!”\r\n\r\nHe paused and gave me a quick glance. He wanted to see how I took that,\r\nI presume.\r\n\r\n“The body of a man,” he went on. “And the queerest-looking man I ever\r\nsaw in my life. He was lying on his belly and I didn’t get a look at\r\nthe front of him just then, but I knew it was a man all right. He was\r\ncovered all over with long hair like a--well, like a bear, say. Not a\r\nstitch of clothes.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, I was that surprised I let my pan and shovel drop and stared at\r\nthe damn thing with the eyes near popping out of my head. What would\r\nanybody do, finding a hair-covered thing like that frozen in a glacier?\r\nI won’t deny I was a bit scared, MacNeal.\r\n\r\n“Well, I stood there staring at the thing for I don’t know how long.\r\nIt didn’t occur to me, then, to ask myself how the thing got there.\r\nCertainly the idea of fossils or prehistoric men didn’t enter my head.\r\nI didn’t think much about anything; I just stood there gaping.\r\n\r\n“You know me, MacNeal; I guess I’m pretty soft-hearted in some\r\nrespects. I’d stop to bury a dead dog I found in the road. I knew I\r\nwouldn’t rest easy until I’d cut that thing out of the glacier and\r\ngiven it decent burial. Moreover, I didn’t want it where I’d be seeing\r\nit when I went to work on that hillside in the spring; and it would\r\nsurely be there in the spring, because I imagine that glacier didn’t\r\nmove an inch a year.\r\n\r\n“So I went back to the shack and got my ax, and with none too good a\r\nheart for the job turned to and made the chips fly. It took me about\r\nthree hours to get the thing out of the glacier. You see, as I came\r\ndown to it I went slow; I don’t care to hack even a dead man.\r\n\r\n“Say, MacNeal, can you imagine what it meant to me, digging a corpse\r\nout of a glacier down there on the side of a hill in that devil-ridden\r\ncountry? No, you can’t, and that’s the truth. You’d have to go through\r\nit to know. It was hell. I don’t want any more of it in mine. Nor what\r\nfollowed, either.”\r\n\r\n“What was that?” I asked when he deliberated.\r\n\r\n“You’ll hear,” he answered, and went on: “I got the thing out at last,\r\nlittle chunks of ice clinging to it, and dragged it ashore, if a\r\nglacier has a shore. It froze me to look at the thing with those little\r\nchunks of ice sticking to the long hair. Once, at Dawson, I’d seen a\r\nman pulled out of the Yukon, ice clinging to him. That was different,\r\nthough; at Dawson there was a crowd to sort of buck a man up. I turned\r\nthe thing over on its back to see what it looked like in front.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said I.\r\n\r\n“You’ve seen apes, MacNeal?”\r\n\r\n“This thing looked like that?” I countered, beginning to connect up his\r\nfirst queer questions with what he was telling me. “You don’t mean it,\r\nChris!”\r\n\r\n“I’m telling you,” he nodded solemnly. “An ape man, that’s what it was.\r\nMore man than ape, if you ask me. For instance, the face was flatter\r\nthan an ape’s, and the forehead and chin were more pronounced. The nose\r\nwas flat, but it wasn’t an ape’s nose. And the hands and feet were like\r\nthose of a man. Oh, it was a man, all right. The thing that convinced\r\nme, I think, was the knife gripped in its hand.”\r\n\r\n“The knife you have there?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“This very knife,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“What then, Chris?” I urged him to go on.\r\n\r\n“I had a good look at that thing and started for my shack. Yes,\r\nMacNeal, I ran, and I’m not ashamed to say so. It scared me. Ugliest\r\nthing I ever saw. Eyes wide open, glaring and glinting, and the thick\r\nlips parted to show the nastiest set of fangs I ever saw in the mouth\r\nof man or beast. Why, I tell you the damned thing looked _alive_! No\r\nwonder I scooted. You would have done the same. Anybody would.\r\n\r\n“Back in the shack, I sat down on my bunk to think it over. And it was\r\nwhile I sat there trying to puzzle it out that I remembered that theory\r\nabout the earth tipping over. That gave me a hint of what I had run up\r\nagainst. Of course, I’d heard about fossils and parts of the skeletons\r\nof prehistoric men being found. Had I found, not a fossil or part of a\r\nskeleton, but the prehistoric man himself? That knocked the wind out\r\nof me. If that were the case my name would go down in history and I\r\nwould be asked to give lectures before scientific societies and such.\r\nConsider it, MacNeal.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, I couldn’t quite grasp the thing. It was incredible. There\r\nI was in this year of our Lord, with the intact corpse of a man who had\r\nlived God only knows how many centuries ago. That body, understand,\r\ncould well be the key to the mystery of the origin of mankind. It\r\nmight possibly settle the Darwinian theory forever, one way or the\r\nother. It was a pretty serious business for me, don’t you see?\r\n\r\n“Well, I decided to preserve the thing until I could get out and make\r\na report of the find. But how to preserve it? Of course if I had left\r\nit in the glacier it would have kept indefinitely, like a side of beef\r\nin cold storage. I was afraid to put it back in the hole in the glacier\r\nand freeze it in again with water I carried from the creek; the creek\r\nwater might exert some chemical action that would ruin the thing. And\r\nif I let it lay where it was the snow would cover it, form a warm\r\nblanket, and probably cause it to decompose, then I’d have nothing left\r\nbut the skeleton. I wanted to save the thing just as I’d found it;\r\nmaybe the scientists would find a way to embalm it.\r\n\r\n“I finally hit on the plan of keeping it in an ice pack. That would\r\nturn the trick until the weather took on the job. It hadn’t turned\r\nbitter cold yet. I tell you, it was a nasty job keeping that thing\r\niced with chunks I chopped from the glacier, and to make it worse the\r\nweather stayed moderate for a couple of weeks. Then, suddenly, the\r\nmercury in my little thermometer went down with a rush and it got\r\nstinging cold. I carried the thing to the shack and stood it up against\r\nthe wall outside where it couldn’t be covered with snow, and lashed it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“Can you imagine me going to sleep in my bunk in the shack every night\r\nafter that, with that thing standing against the wall outside not two\r\nfeet away? Of course you can’t. It frazzled my nerves, and more than\r\nonce I was tempted to cut a hole in the ice on the creek and chuck the\r\ndamn thing in where I’d never see it again. But no, I had to save it\r\nfor the scientists and get my name in history; that idea got to be an\r\nobsession with me. I knew well enough that if ever I told people the\r\ntale I’m telling you now, without some proof of it, I’d get laughed at.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt of it,” I sneered.\r\n\r\n“The days went by,” he continued, ignoring my sneer, “and more and more\r\nthat thing outside kept getting on my nerves. The sun went south, and\r\nfrom one day to another I never saw it. The never-ending night was bad\r\nenough, but when you add the northern lights and the howling of the\r\nwolves you’ve got a condition that breaks a man if he’s not careful.\r\nFurthermore, there was that ugly-looking devil outside to think about.\r\n\r\n“I was thinking about that thing constantly, and got so I couldn’t\r\nsleep. If I shut my eyes I’d see it, anyhow, and if I went to sleep I’d\r\nhave a nightmare over it. Now and then I’d go out and stand there in\r\nthe starlight or the aurora looking at it. It fascinated me, yet the\r\nsight of the thing gave me the creeps. Finally I began taking a club or\r\nmy rifle along when I went to look at it; got afraid the thing would\r\ncome alive and try to murder me with that knife.\r\n\r\n“And that’s the way of things for maybe three months and more. My\r\nthoughts all the time on that thing outside.\r\n\r\n“Well, that couldn’t go on, you know. One morning I woke up with the\r\nworst headache a man ever had. I thought my head would split wide open.\r\nMy blood was like molten iron flowing through my veins. I knew what it\r\nwas. _Fever._ I had thought and worried about that thing outside until\r\nit got me, and I was in for a brain-storm. I was as weak as a cat, but\r\nmanaged to build up a good fire and pack my bunk with all the blankets\r\nand furs I had and crawl in. I only hoped I wouldn’t freeze to death\r\nwhen the fire went out.\r\n\r\n“I no sooner got all set in the bunk than things let go; I went\r\ncompletely off. I can’t say positively what happened for a few\r\ndays after that. Seems like I remember, though, periods when I was\r\nsemi-rational. I think once I got up to put more wood on the fire.\r\nAnother time I saw that thing standing in the doorway grinning at me\r\nlike the devil it was. I shot at it with my rifle and later found a\r\nbullet in the door. My shooting couldn’t have been a delusion, at any\r\nrate. But the door was still fastened against the wolves and there\r\nwere no tracks in the snow outside.”\r\n\r\nBonner paused to light his pipe, and then went on:\r\n\r\n“I don’t know exactly how long I was out of my head. I’d wound my watch\r\nbefore I crawled into the bunk the first time, and I half remember I\r\nwound it again when I got up to put wood on the fire, and it was pretty\r\nwell run down. It goes forty hours without winding, yet when my head\r\ncleared it had stopped. I must have been off my nut about four days.\r\n\r\n“Well, you can lay your bottom dollar I’d had enough of prehistoric men\r\nhanging around the shack by that time. Let the scientists be damned; I\r\nwas determined to get rid of that thing the quickest way possible. The\r\nquickest way, I thought, would be to get the corpse warm so it would\r\ndecompose rapidly, then I’d put it outside where the wolves and ravens\r\nwould pick the bones clean. The scientists would have to be satisfied\r\nwith the skeleton.\r\n\r\n“So I made a big fire in the fireplace and got the shack good and hot,\r\nthen went out and brought in the corpse. I got sick at the stomach on\r\nthat job, but that was the only way. I didn’t have the heart to leave\r\nthe thing outside and build a fire over it out there. I try to respect\r\nthe dead, even if the corpse is that of a man who had been dead several\r\nthousand years and looked more like an animal than a human being.\r\n\r\n“I laid the thing on the floor before the fireplace, then sat down on\r\nthe bunk to wait. I watched it pretty close, because, being dead so\r\nlong, I thought when it got warm and started to decompose it would go\r\nlike butter; I didn’t want the shack to be all smelled up with the\r\nstink of it. Probably half an hour went by, then all of a sudden _I saw\r\nthe thing quiver--_”\r\n\r\n“Your brain-storm returning,” I interposed.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Bonner sharply. “It quivered; not much, but enough to\r\nnotice. That sort of got me, then I reasoned that anything thawing out\r\nlike that would naturally quiver a little. Maybe another fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes passed, then one of the legs moved. Jerked, sort of. It\r\nstartled me. Remember, there I was down there in those hills alone with\r\nthat thing. I was pretty susceptible to weird influences, understand.\r\nAnyhow, the leg moved, and--”\r\n\r\n“It sat up and asked for a drink of water.” I could not help putting\r\nin. Bonner continued, paying no attention to my sarcasm. He seemed to\r\nbe talking aloud to himself:\r\n\r\n“I watched it like a hawk for some time after that, then as I didn’t\r\nsee it move any more I stepped outside to get some more wood for the\r\nfire and to pull a few good breaths of cold air into my lungs. That\r\nshack was like the inside of an oven.\r\n\r\n“When I went in again I saw that the damned thing _had turned over on\r\nits back_.\r\n\r\n“Turned over on its back, I say. And there was a change in the eyes,\r\ntoo; they had a half-awake sort of look in them; a more _alive_ look,\r\nunderstand. And breathing! Yes, sir, _breathing_! Why the thing didn’t\r\nsee me when I came in and shut the door I don’t know, but apparently it\r\ndidn’t. And, believe me or not, the hand that had held the knife was\r\nopen and the knife was lying on the floor apart from the body.\r\n\r\n“Crazy? I tell you _no_! I was as sane as I am now. I tell you I saw\r\nthese things with my own two eyes; saw them just as plain as I see you\r\nnow. I see you don’t believe me, MacNeal. Oh, well, I don’t blame you;\r\nI hardly believe it myself sometimes.”\r\n\r\nHe uttered a little laugh.\r\n\r\n“But there it was, just as I’m telling you. And I was that gone when I\r\nsaw that the thing had turned over on its back that I dropped the wood\r\nI had in my arm. The crash of it on the floor brought the thing to its\r\nfeet on the jump. You needn’t look at me like that; I tell you it did.\r\nI take my oath it did! There it was, crouched like a panther ready for\r\nthe spring, the eyes of it flashing like fire, its lips pulled back\r\ntight across the gums and the yellow fangs showing. Can you see that?\r\nNo, you can’t.”\r\n\r\nBonner made an expressive gesture with one hand.\r\n\r\n“Remarkable, but the thing hadn’t seen me yet. It was looking at the\r\nfire; it was half turned toward me so I could see that. Suddenly it\r\nscreamed in an outlandish gibberish and leaped to the fireplace and\r\ntried to gather in an armful of flames. I take it the thing had never\r\nseen fire before; didn’t know what it was; probably imagined it some\r\nkind of wild animal. Naturally the only thing it got out of that play\r\nwas burned arms and hands, and the long hair sizzled and curled. It\r\nleaped back with a snarl, spitting that funny gibberish. Talk, I guess\r\nit was; it came from way down in the belly and sounded like pigs\r\ngrunting.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, MacNeal, I was fair dazed. But I had the sense left to\r\ntry to help myself. My rifle was leaning against the bunk and I made\r\na quick dive for it. Then, apparently, the thing saw me for the first\r\ntime. The way it glared at me with those glittering eyes was a caution.\r\nI didn’t stop to argue; I snatched up the rifle, cocked it and made\r\na snap shot. The bullet caught the thing in the left breast and the\r\nblood gushed. Of course you don’t believe it. But blood, I tell you,\r\ngushed from the breast of a thing that had been frozen in a glacier for\r\nthousands of years!\r\n\r\n“Well, here it came like a cyclone. I didn’t have time to shoot again.\r\nSmell? That thing smelled like carrion; almost strangled me. Maybe you\r\nknow how the cage of a wild animal stinks if it ain’t cleaned out for a\r\nweek or two. This thing smelled like that, only worse. I can smell it\r\nyet. Lord!”\r\n\r\nBonner wrinkled his nose and shivered.\r\n\r\n“But there we were at grips, the thing making those belly noises and\r\nsmelling like a thousand garbage piles. It had the strength of ten men;\r\nI sensed that. It jerked the rifle from me and bent the barrel of it\r\ndouble with a twist of the wrists. The barrel of a thirty-eight caliber\r\nWinchester rifle--bent it as easy as you or I would bend a piece of\r\ncopper wire.\r\n\r\n“Then we were at it, fighting like a couple of wild cats all over the\r\nshack. I’m no slouch of a man myself, MacNeal, when it comes to a\r\nrough-and-tumble; but that thing handled me like a baby. I could see\r\nmy finish. We threshed about the floor, me fighting like a devil, it\r\nfighting like forty devils. We kicked into the fire and out again and\r\nscattered live coals all over the place, and the shack took fire.\r\n\r\n“I was just about gone when my hand accidentally fell on the handle of\r\nthe knife the thing had dropped on the floor. I hung on to it and poked\r\naway at that thing for all I was worth, driving the blade clean up to\r\nthe hilt with every punch.”\r\n\r\n“That knife?” I broke in.\r\n\r\n“This knife,” answered Bonner. “There’s the dried blood on it yet. But\r\nI think it was really the bullet that did the work. It must have cut an\r\nartery. Anyhow, the blood kept gushing out of the thing’s breast; it\r\ngot on my hands and made ’em slippery. I knew the thing couldn’t pour\r\nout blood like that and keep going; that’s what put the heart in me to\r\nkeep on fighting. And, as I say, I think it was the bullet that did the\r\nwork in the long run. A lucky shot, otherwise I wouldn’t be here now.\r\n\r\n“I felt the thing sagging and going limp in my hands, and its grip\r\nbegan to relax. I saw my chance and put up a knee and broke the grip\r\nand kicked it away. It staggered around a moment or two, clutching its\r\nbreast with its bloody paws, gnashing its fangs and glaring murder at\r\nme; then it crashed down to the floor and fell smack into the flames.\r\n\r\n“I saw plain enough there was no chance of saving the shack, so I\r\nsnatched up what I could lay my hands on in the way of food and\r\nclothing and blankets, and tore out. I don’t remember putting the knife\r\nin my pocket, but that’s where I found it later. The shack burned down\r\nto nothing, and that thing burned with it; probably not a bone of it\r\nleft. The scientists were out of luck and the mystery of mankind would\r\nremain unsolved.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t stop to investigate, of course; my job was to make tracks. I\r\nknew about this village and came on. How I got here I don’t know; this\r\nis a terrible country to cross afoot in the winter. I’d turned my ten\r\nhuskies adrift to shift for themselves when I reached the valley where\r\nall this happened; I didn’t have the grub to keep them going. I had to\r\nwalk here.\r\n\r\n“And that’s all, MacNeal. You can say what you please; I know what I\r\nsaw with my own eyes and you can’t change my mind about it. Suspended\r\nanimation? Yes, for a period covering many centuries. It would be a\r\nmighty fine thing if we could picture what happened away back there\r\nwhen this old earth tipped over.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we’d see a man, a man that was half ape, crossing a creek\r\nwith a knife in his hand on the way to murder an enemy sleeping on the\r\nopposite bank. Then suddenly the earth tipped over--climatic conditions\r\nin those days were such as to freeze things up in a flash--things are\r\nheld in the grip of the ice just as the dust and lava held ’em in the\r\ndays of Pompeii, and--\r\n\r\n“Well, who’s to say what happened? Anything was possible. We don’t know\r\nthe conditions of those days. Anyhow, here I come thousands of years\r\nlater and dig a man, with a knife in his hand, out of a glacier. I\r\nheat his body in order to decompose the flesh. Instead of decomposing;\r\nhe comes to life and I have to kill him. He’s been hibernating in a\r\nglacier for centuries. I don’t know what to think about it.”\r\n\r\nBonner refilled and lighted his pipe, then looked at me questioningly.\r\n\r\n“Chris,” I said, “I tell you frankly that I don’t believe a word you\r\nhave said. You tell me you were out of your head for a few days. That\r\naccounts for it. You had the jim-jams and imagined all that, then try\r\nto spring it on me as actual fact.”\r\n\r\nHe looked hurt. He looked at the knife in his hand steadily for several\r\nlong moments, then thrust it toward me, his eyes boring into mine.\r\n\r\n“Then where in hell,” he demanded, “did I get this knife?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _FEAR_\r\n\r\n                         _By_ David R. Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were only five words.\r\n\r\nThey neither affirmed nor denied what had gone before. But they changed\r\nthe whole trend of the argument.\r\n\r\nThe men of the engineering gang were lying around the camp-fire,\r\npreparatory to going out on the job. It was cool in the shade of\r\nthe thick trees, with the damp feel of early morning hanging over\r\neverything. Further out, over the river, the sun gave promise of better\r\nweather later in the day.\r\n\r\nSmoking, waiting for the laggards to clean up their plates, the\r\nengineering gang--according to invariable man-custom--had begun\r\nexperiences, jokes, arguments. Over all hung the pungent smell of\r\nstrong, fresh coffee, and much frying bacon.\r\n\r\nBaldy Jenkins, the eighteen-year-old had started it.\r\n\r\n“Wish I had a million dollars,” he remarked.\r\n\r\nRed Flannel Mike gave the ball a roll.\r\n\r\n“You do not,” he denied stoutly. “Be givin’ you a million--and the Lord\r\nhisself only knows what you’d be a-doing wid it.”\r\n\r\n“Hell I don’t,” said Baldy. “Bet I could tell you right now how I’d\r\nspend every penny of it.”\r\n\r\n“Bet you don’t,” broke in another of the gang. “Fellow never does know\r\nwhat he’s goin’ to do till it hits him, square between the eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Offer me a million,” insisted Baldy Jenkins.\r\n\r\n“Aw, not that way. Take somep’n where two men might act different. You\r\ndon’t know what you’d do. I don’t. No man does--no more’n that kid over\r\nthere does.”\r\n\r\nHis lazy gesture indicated a small, khaki-trousered figure. The eyes of\r\nthe rest of the gang followed.\r\n\r\nAt first glance she might have been a lad of ten or eleven years.\r\nCloser inspection, however, showed the mop of flaxen hair, bobbed off\r\nat the level of her ears, and the tender, little-girl face. She was\r\nmarching around the camp like an inspector-general of an army, into\r\nthis, that, everything.\r\n\r\n“’Cert she wouldn’t,” affirmed Red Flannel Mike. “Coulter’s kid’s just\r\nlike you or me. She’d have to be up against it to know--an’ maybe not\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“Huh! Even that kid....” Baldy snatched up the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nThey were off. Hot and royally raged the battle.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the unexpected gained ascendancy. Louder and more\r\nextravagant grew their claims. No man could predict anything. No man\r\nknew what he would do. Put him face to face with any situation, any\r\ndanger, and he would act differently from the way he thought he would.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Coulter spoke.\r\n\r\nHe did not raise his voice. If anything, it was lowered. Hitherto, he\r\nhad sat, silent, listening to the battle of words, his bandaged left\r\narm swung tightly at his side.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about that,” was all he said.\r\n\r\nSudden quiet fell. There came a restless stirring, then tacit\r\nagreement. These men of rougher employment--axmen, chainmen,\r\nengineers--centered their gaze upon Coulter’s bandaged left arm.\r\n\r\nThey knew what he was thinking about. They, too, had seen. They agreed\r\nwith him that he could have but one possible reaction to one set of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAll of them were employees, of one branch or the other, of the\r\nConsolidated Lumber Company. Coulter was in the legal department. There\r\nhad arisen a nice question as to the exact ownership of a certain\r\ntract. Rather than take chances with the heavy statutory penalties for\r\ncutting trees upon another’s land, they had sent a lawyer upon the\r\nground. His work was finished. He was ready--more than ready--to return.\r\n\r\nCity-bred, city born, Coulter had welcomed the chance to see a Southern\r\nswamp. He had read, all his life, of Dixie, the land of the magnolia\r\nand cotton, of the mockingbird and the honeysuckle. He had welcomed his\r\nmission. He had even brought his daughter, Ruth, along.\r\n\r\nThat was not at all unnatural, however. Wherever Coulter had gone\r\nfor the last ten years, there, too, had gone Ruth. They had not been\r\nseparated longer than a day since the gray dawn that the other Ruth had\r\nplaced the tiny bundle in his arms and turned her face to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe child was all that was left of their love save memories. She was\r\nCoulter’s sole interest in life.\r\n\r\nComing to this camp, Coulter had clad her in khaki, and turned her\r\nloose in the open. It had done her good.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the stained figures around the camp-fire followed his gaze.\r\nThey knew something of what he was thinking. They had heard him, in\r\nthe midst of his pain, setting his teeth, gasp: “Get--Ruth away--where\r\nshe--can’t hear!”\r\n\r\nThat, from a man whom they had to restrain from killing himself to get\r\nfreedom from the torture, was enough.\r\n\r\nCoulter’s ignorance of the South and of the woods had been, perhaps, to\r\nblame. He did not know. All that he could remember was that he had been\r\nbending over the spring, his left arm resting upon the brink. He had\r\nnot seen the moccasin until it was too late.\r\n\r\nVividly, even yet, he saw the darkish head and body, the supple,\r\nwrithing, the swift dart and the flash of pain--and then agony; much\r\nagony, deep, soul-biting torture.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no doctor at the camp. There had been a delay before,\r\nstupefied, he thought to let them know he had been bit. And then--more\r\nagony; agony piled upon agony.\r\n\r\nNot concealing their doubts as to their chances of saving his arm\r\nor him, they had slapped the rough tourniquet upon his arm, and had\r\ntwisted down upon the stick until he moaned, unwillingly, in pain.\r\nThen they had dipped one of the big hunting knives into boiling water,\r\nand had cut his arm at the bite marks--gashing it across, with great,\r\nfree-handed strokes, then back again at right angles; squeezing the\r\ncuts to make him lose the poisoned blood.\r\n\r\nThen they had cauterized the wound. Sick, half afaint, to Coulter it\r\nseemed that they were deliberately thinking up additional tortures. The\r\nwhite-hot iron that seared his flesh, tormenting the agonized ends of\r\nnerves that already had borne past the breaking point, was the final,\r\nexquisite touch of agony.\r\n\r\nCoulter was one of those men who bear pain--even a slight pain--with\r\ndifficulty. Even the sight of blood made him faint. This was horrible\r\nbeyond anything he had ever dreamed. The physical racking; the feel of\r\nthe steel blade cutting through his own flesh and sinew, down to the\r\nbone, made him bite his lips till they spurted blood, in the effort to\r\nkeep from screaming aloud.\r\n\r\nHe had not known they were through. He thought they were preparing\r\nadditional crucifixion for him.\r\n\r\nRed Flannel Mike had slapped the gun from his hands and made him\r\nunderstand, somehow, that it was all over; that they were through. But\r\nthey watched him the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nThat was why, as the argument rose around the morning camp-fire,\r\nCoulter was very sure that he knew what he would do under one set of\r\ncircumstances. He knew one experience that nothing on earth could send\r\nhim through again. All that, and more, was in his tone, as he spoke.\r\n\r\nAt his words there came a restless stirring around the fire. Those men\r\nof the engineering gang had seen something of his experience. They knew\r\nwhat he was thinking. The abrupt ending of their argument showed that\r\nthey agreed with Coulter.\r\n\r\nHe saw, and understood; and, seeing, smiled bitterly. They knew only a\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\nTo every man there is his one fear. The bravest man that ever trod the\r\nearth had his one especial dread. To some, it is fire; to others, cold\r\nsteel; others still, the clash of physical contact. But, probe deep\r\nenough beneath the skin of any man alive, and you find it.\r\n\r\nSnakes were Coulter’s fear.\r\n\r\nHe could not explain it. He did not know why he, a man city-bred and\r\nborn, had this obsession. It had been with him since he could remember.\r\nAs a child, once he had gone into a convulsion of fear over some\r\npictures of snakes in a book.\r\n\r\nThe old women of the family nodded their heads wisely, and muttered\r\nthings about a fright to his mother before his birth. Coulter did not\r\nknow. All that he was certain about was that the thought, even, of the\r\nwrithing, slippery squirming bodies, made his whole being shudder with\r\nrevulsion, made tingles of absolute horror go up and down his back.\r\n\r\nYes, the gang agreed with him. Yet they had seen only a part of what\r\nhe had gone through. They had seen and appreciated only his physical\r\nsuffering--and that was the least part.\r\n\r\nCoulter’s nerves were in ragged shreds. He started and jumped at the\r\nslightest sound. His experience had intensified a thousandfold his\r\nnervous horror of reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe woods, the swamp, were full of them. He ran upon them constantly.\r\nAll the time he was longing for his hour of liberation, when he could\r\nreturn to the city and to freedom.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected flutter of a thrush, as he walked through the woods,\r\nwould send his heart into his throat and his pulse to pounding in fear.\r\nNight after night he woke, chained hand and foot with dread that a\r\nsnake had crawled up, in the dark, beside him. All the stories he had\r\never read of their crawling up into camps and getting into the bedding,\r\ncame to him, lingered with him, tortured him. He was no more asleep\r\nbefore he would awake, bathed in a cold sweat, afraid to move, afraid\r\nto lie still.\r\n\r\nAll that, subconsciously, was in his words, in his manner, in his whole\r\nexpression, as he said:\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about that.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere came the silence of conviction. Even Red Flannel Mike, most\r\nzealous exponent of man’s lack of knowledge of himself, was silenced.\r\n\r\n“Somebody said something about the kid.” Baldy, the eighteen-year-old,\r\nseized his advantage. “I’ll bet that even she--”\r\n\r\nBaldy stopped abruptly. His whole frame stiffened. His eyes were\r\nriveted upon little Ruth. One by one, the rest of the gang turned to\r\nfollow his gaze. Each followed his example.\r\n\r\nRuth’s scream cut the air a moment before Baldy’s gasp of horror:\r\n\r\n“My God! The kid’s _got a moccasin on her_!”\r\n\r\nThe child was close enough for the group to see clearly. Her head was\r\nbent back, straining away from the writhing horror. The sleek head\r\nslithered to and fro, darting, threatening, winding here and there\r\nabout her. She seemed frozen with fear.\r\n\r\nBaldy had started forward. He stopped.\r\n\r\n“I--get me a gun!” he barked. “Get a gun! _Quick!_”\r\n\r\nThe reptile drew back its head. There came an interruption:\r\n\r\nWhite to his lips, staggering upon his feet, Coulter came forward.\r\nHis face was ghastly pale. His unwilling feet buckled under him,\r\nthreatening, each moment, to give way and pitch him forward upon his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nSlowly he edged closer. The slender head poised, watchful. Coulter’s\r\nmovements were scarcely discernible. Suddenly his well arm shot out,\r\nseizing, snatching at that loathsome body.\r\n\r\nThere was a quick movement of the snake, far too rapid to be\r\nanticipated or avoided. The head drove forward. He felt the white hot\r\nflash of pain.\r\n\r\nThe rest was a haze of horror to him. It was rather as if he were a\r\nspectator at something concerning someone else. He did not command his\r\nbody. He knew only, vaguely, what was happening.\r\n\r\nThere came the feel of a sleek body in his hands, the lash and writhing\r\nagainst his arms of something that fought to break away; then the\r\ngrinding of his heel upon a head, and the flinging, against him, in\r\ndeath agony.\r\n\r\nEverything faded out, then.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis return to consciousness was marked by a hazy lightness of memory.\r\n\r\nIn the bitten arm he could feel, mounting higher and higher, the\r\nnumbness that had marked the other experience. His heart, too, seemed\r\nto be acting queerly--just as it had done before.\r\n\r\nRed Flannel Mike’s broad back was bent from him as he mixed at\r\nsomething in a basin. They had carried him to his own tent.\r\n\r\nCoulter’s holster was hanging from the tent pole. The numbness crept\r\nhigher in his arm. Soon would begin the cutting of his flesh, the\r\ndarting flames of pain....\r\n\r\nHe could not go through with that again! He could not bear it. Better\r\nfar to finish with the gun what Mike had stopped before.\r\n\r\nSoftly he slid the gun from the holster, and raised it for action. His\r\nfinger pressed upon the trigger.\r\n\r\nThe weapon was dashed suddenly from his hand.\r\n\r\n“What the hell!” roared Mike. “You fool, what’s the matter with you?”\r\n\r\n“Give--give me that gun!”\r\n\r\n“You’re as bad as Baldy Jenkins. Been in the woods all his life--and\r\nmistakes a coach whip for a moccasin, just because both of ’em are\r\ndarkish.\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t any more moccasin than a polar bear.... Yes, ’course he\r\nstruck you. Any snake ’ll do that--but it ain’t always poison. Your arm\r\nain’t even go’ner be sore.\r\n\r\n“Never mind about this gun. I’ll give it back to you--later on.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _You’ll Be Thrilled and Mystified\r\n  By Hamilton Craigie’s New Novelette_\r\n\r\n                               The Chain\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _I._\r\n\r\n                               TROUBLE.\r\n\r\nQuarrier entered the taxi with an uneasy sense of crisis.\r\n\r\nHe was not imaginative; his digestion was excellent; even at forty,\r\nan age when most men nowadays have begun to feel the strain of fierce\r\nbusiness competition, Quarrier was almost the man that he had been ten\r\nyears in the past.\r\n\r\nNerves and Quarrier were strangers; he smoked his after-dinner cigar in\r\na rigorous self-denial that made it his sole dissipation; he was in bed\r\nand asleep when other men were comfortably faring forth in search of\r\nsuch diversion as the metropolis had to offer.\r\n\r\nBut the face of that taxi-driver--he had seen it somewhere before. It\r\nwas a dark, Italian face, with high cheekbones, and a straight, cruel\r\nmouth, like a wedge, between lean cheeks scarred and scabbed with\r\nlate-healed cicatrices and pocked blue with powder burns.\r\n\r\nNot an inviting face. And the taxi was old. Glancing at the cushions,\r\nas they had roared past an arc-light at the street corner, Quarrier had\r\nthought to see the dingy leather sown thick with stains, broad patches,\r\nas if--as if....\r\n\r\nBut pshaw! As he told himself, he was getting fanciful; perhaps his\r\nliver, at last, had played him false. A migraine, doubtless--he’d have\r\na look in on old Peterby in the morning. Peterby was a good, plain\r\nold-fashioned practitioner--no nonsense about _him_....\r\n\r\nHe had gone to the offices of the Intervale Steel Company on a mission,\r\nan important one. As a matter of fact, it was vital--almost a matter of\r\nlife and death. But he smiled grimly now in the dark recesses of the\r\ncab as he reflected that, as it chanced, his last-minute decision had\r\nleft those documents where they would be beyond the reach of--Hubert\r\nMarston, for instance.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing on his person of any special value; he would be poor\r\npicking, indeed, if, as it chanced, that taxi-driver with the face of a\r\nbravo might, behind the sinister mask that was his face, be the thug he\r\nseemed, hired, perhaps, by the Panther of Peacock Alley.\r\n\r\nAn extravagant appellation, doubtless, but that was Marston: Suave,\r\nsinister, debonair--the social _roturier_ equally with the manipulator.\r\nHe had acquired the name naturally enough, for most of his operations\r\nwere carried on in the hotels and clubs.\r\n\r\nHe had an office hard by the “Alley” and it was from its ornate\r\nsplendor that he issued, on occasion, gardenia in buttonhole, cane\r\nhooked over his arm, dark face with its inscrutable smile flashing upon\r\nthe habitués with what meaning only he could say. And he did not choose\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\nAnd Marston had wanted those documents; they spelled the difference to\r\nhim between durance and liberty--aye, between life and death....\r\n\r\nFor Hubert Marston had made the one slip that, soon or late, the most\r\ncareful criminal makes: He had, yielding on a sudden to his one rare\r\nimpulse of hate, commissioned the murder of a man who stood in his way,\r\nand--he had paid for it, as he had thought, in good crisp treasury\r\nnotes, honest as the day, certainly! But the payment had been made at\r\nsecond--or third-hand--that was Marston’s way. And for once it had\r\nbetrayed him.\r\n\r\nFor those documents--as he had found out, too late--were counterfeit\r\ntreasury notes. The go-between had seen to that, paying the hired\r\nkiller with them, and pocketing the genuine. And Quarrier, himself the\r\nwatch-dog of those interests that Marston would have despoiled, (he had\r\nbeen retained by them for some time now as their private investigator)\r\nhad found, first, the disgruntled bravo himself, obtained the spurious\r\nnotes, together with the man’s confession, traced them backward to the\r\ngo-between--and now, hard upon the arch-criminal’s heels, he waited\r\nonly for the morning, and that which would follow.\r\n\r\nQuarrier had given the driver a number in the West Eighties, but now,\r\nglancing from the window, his eyes narrowed with a sudden, swift\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n“The devil!” he ejaculated, under his breath. “Now, if I thought--”\r\n\r\nBut the sentence was never completed. They were in a narrow, unfamiliar\r\nstreet; a street silent, tenantless, as it seemed, save for dark\r\ndoorways, and here and there a furtive, drifting shadow-shape--the tall\r\nfronts of warehouses, with blind eyes to the night, silent, grim.\r\n\r\nThe echoing roar of the engine beat in a swift clamor against those\r\niron walls--and suddenly, with a sort of _click_, he remembered where\r\nit was he had seen that lupine countenance--the dark face of the driver\r\nseparated from him by the width of a single pane of glass.\r\n\r\nIt had been behind glass that he had seen it. A month or so previous,\r\nat the invitation of his friend, Gregory Vinson, captain of detectives\r\n(with whom he had formerly been associated, prior to his present\r\nconnection), he had visited headquarters; and it had been there, in\r\nthe gallery which is given over to rogues, that he had marked that\r\nface, its features, even among the many crooks, thugs, strong-arm men,\r\nyeggs, hoisters, pennyweighters, housemen, and scratchers. And now he\r\nremembered it when it was too late!\r\n\r\nHis right hand falling upon the butt of a blunt-nosed automatic, with\r\nwhich he was never without, with his left he jerked strongly at the\r\nhandle of the door. But the door was locked; he could not open it.\r\n\r\nQuarrier had been in a tight place more than once; danger he was not\r\nunacquainted with; it had been with him in broad daylight, in darkness,\r\ngrinning at his elbow with dirk or pistol in the highways and byways\r\nof Criminopolis. He was a fighter--or he would not have won to the\r\npossession of those documents--the documents so greatly desired by\r\nHubert Marston--the evidence of the one false step made by the Master\r\nof Chicane, the one slip that was to put him, ere the setting of\r\nanother sun, where he would be safe.\r\n\r\nNow Quarrier, his mouth a grim line, was reaching with the butt of his\r\nautomatic to break that glass when, with a grinding of brakes the taxi\r\nwhirled suddenly to a groaning halt.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open--to the windy night without, and the glimmer of a\r\ndark face at the curb.\r\n\r\n“Here you are, sir,” Quarrier heard the voice, with, he was certain,\r\na mocking quality in the quasi-deferential cadence. But he could see\r\nmerely the face, behind it a black well of darkness, velvet black, save\r\nfor the dim loom of a lofty building just across.\r\n\r\nQuarrier did not know how many there might be, lurking there in the\r\nblackness, nor did he greatly care. The locked door; the face of the\r\nman at the wheel; the unfamiliar street--shanghaied by a land pirate,\r\nat the very least! There could be no doubt of it.\r\n\r\nBut it was no time for hesitation. If he were in the wrong, and it was\r\nall a mistake--well, he could afford to pay. But--the face of Marston\r\narose before him, suave, sinister, smiling.... What was it the man had\r\nsaid, on the occasion of their last meeting at the Intervale offices:\r\n\r\n“Possession, my dear Quarrier--possession is ten points of the lawless.\r\nRemember that!”\r\n\r\nQuarrier remembered, and with the remembrance came a swift, sudden\r\nanger. But it was an anger that was controlled, as a flame is\r\ncontrolled--though it was none the less deadly.\r\n\r\n“Here you are, sir,” repeated the voice, and now there was in it a\r\nsomething more than mockery. There was an edge, a rasp; almost it\r\nsounded like a command, an order.\r\n\r\nQuarrier grinned then--a mere facial contraction of the lips. Then,\r\nmuscle and mind and body, in one furious projectile, he launched\r\nhimself outward through the doorway in a diving tackle.\r\n\r\nThe white face with its sneering grin was blotted out; there came the\r\nspank of a clean-cut blow; a turgid oath. Quarrier, rising from his\r\nknees, surveyed the limp figure on the cobbles with a twisted smile;\r\nthen he turned, peering under his hand down a long tunnel of gloom,\r\nwhere, at the far end, a light showed, like a will-o-the-wisp beckoning\r\nhim on.\r\n\r\nHe could not tell where he was. Somewhere in the Forties, he\r\njudged--Hell’s Kitchen, probably--although there was a curious lack of\r\nthe life and movement boiling to full tide in that grim neighborhood of\r\nbattle, murder, and sudden death.\r\n\r\nBut as his eyes became accustomed to the stifling dark he found the\r\nreason. It was a street of warehouses, public stores; and further on,\r\nas he looked, like a ribbon of pale flame against the violet sky, he\r\nsaw the river.\r\n\r\nHe bent his steps away from it, walking carefully, picking his way on\r\nthe uneven flagging. Twice, as he went forward, it seemed to him that\r\nhe was watched--that eyes gazed at him out of the blackness; and twice\r\nhe turned his head, swiftly to face the silence and the emptiness of\r\nthe long, lonely way.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed, too, that as he went, the whispering echo of his hasty\r\nsteps went on before him, and behind; he fell to counting them--and\r\nsuddenly he knew. They were before him--and behind. He was in a trap.\r\n\r\nThere came a leaping, thunderous rush at his back, and a voice,\r\nscreaming between the high walls:\r\n\r\n“There he is! Now--go get ’im!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was then that Quarrier, reaching for his pistol, discovered that\r\nit was gone; lost, doubtless, in that encounter with the taxi-driver.\r\nBut he braced, spreading his arms wide as a grizzly meets the onslaught\r\nof wolves. But the wolves were many, and they came on now, a ravening\r\npack; one, before the rest, looming as a black blot against the\r\nstarshine, lunged forward with a growling oath.\r\n\r\nThe rest were yet some little distance away. Quarrier saw the man, or,\r\nrather, he sensed the nearness of that leaning shadow, spread-eagled\r\nlike a bat against the dimness.... Then there came the sudden impact\r\nof fist on flesh--a straining heave--and Quarrier, diving under the\r\nhurtling figure, straightened, and hurled him outward and away.\r\n\r\nThe flying figure struck among the rest, head on, to a growling chorus\r\nof oaths, imprecations. But still they came on, thrusting, lunging; a\r\ngun crashed almost in Quarrier’s face.... There came a voice:\r\n\r\n“No shooting, you fool! Th’ Big Gun says--”\r\n\r\nThe rest was lost as the pistol clattered to the cobbles. The center\r\nof a whirling tangle of fist and foot, to Quarrier it seemed that he\r\nfought in a nightmare that would have no end. He had gone to one knee\r\nunder the impact of a swinging blow, when, from the far distance, there\r\nsounded the rolling rattle of a night-stick, with the clangor of the\r\npatrol.\r\n\r\nSomething gripped his ankle--something at once soft and hard. He\r\nlunged, full length, as a football player at the last desperate urge of\r\nhis spent strength. Then he was on his feet, running, side-stepping,\r\ncircling with the skill and desperate effort of a plunging half-back,\r\nstiff-arming the opposition to right and left.\r\n\r\nJust ahead, the black maw of an alley, a deeper blot of blackness,\r\nloomed. In its heart, like a witch-fire, there swam upward a nebulous,\r\nfaint glow as from the pit; out of the tail of his eye he saw it: The\r\ndim loom of a house, and an open door.\r\n\r\nHe reached the turn--and a figure uprose before him, even in that\r\ndarkness brutish, broad, thewed like a grizzly. The great arm rose,\r\nonce; it fell, like the hammer of Thor.\r\n\r\nQuarrier lurched, stiffened, buckling inward at the knees in a\r\nloose-jointed, slumping fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\n                            Hangman’s Hold.\r\n\r\nQuarrier came to himself, all his faculties at full tide.\r\n\r\nIt was smothering dark--a darkness not merely of the night but of a\r\nprison-house, silent, musty with the stale odor of decay and death.\r\nNear at hand, after a moment, he heard a slow, ceaseless dripping,\r\nlike the beating of a heart, or the slow drip-drip of a life that was\r\nrunning out, drop by single drop.\r\n\r\nThe fancy seemed logical enough; there seemed nothing of the fantastic\r\nin it; Quarrier waited, there in the smothering dark, for the quick\r\nknife-thrust that would mean the end--or the deadening impact of the\r\nslung-shot.\r\n\r\nBut, unimaginative as he was, like a man who has but lately undergone\r\nthe surgeon’s scalpel he feared to move, to feel, even while he assured\r\nhimself that he was unhurt save for the throbbing in his temples, and\r\nthe very bruises that he felt upon him, but would not touch.\r\n\r\nBut there was something else. After a little his hesitant, exploring\r\nfingers found it. The length of line bent in a sort of running bowline\r\nabout his shoulders and arms. And behind him, from a staple in the\r\nwall, it hung, sliding like a snake in the thick darkness.\r\n\r\nHe moved his head, slowly, carefully, like a man testing himself for an\r\ninvisible hurt. And then--\r\n\r\n“Ha!” he breathed, deep in his throat, the shadow of a cry. For, moving\r\nan inch further to the right, it would have been a noose, tightening as\r\nhe moved, strangling him there, choking him out of sound and sense.\r\n\r\nBrave as he was, Quarrier shivered, his shoulders twitching with the\r\nthought. And it was not cold. Moving with an infinite caution, he ran\r\nhis exploring fingers along the hempen strands.\r\n\r\nWhoever had devised that noose had been a sailor. And only a sailor\r\ncould undo it.\r\n\r\nAnd there in the dark, trussed as he was, at the mercy of what other\r\nperil he knew not. Quarrier permitted himself the ghost of a grin.\r\nHis hand went up, slowly, carefully, the fingers busy with the rope;\r\nthere came a tug, and, coiling at his feet like a snake, the noose slid\r\nslithering along the stones.\r\n\r\nQuarrier was not a praying man, in the ordinary sense, but now he sent\r\nheavenward a silent aspiration of gratitude for the impulse which,\r\nyears previous, had prompted his signing on as a foremast hand in the\r\nChina seas. And the long hours in the doldrums, below the line, had, as\r\nit proved, been anything but wasted.\r\n\r\nNow, easing his cramped muscles in a preliminary stretching, he rose\r\ngingerly to his feet, moving with the stealth and caution of an Indian.\r\nHe was free of that constricting rope, but as he moved forward,\r\ngroping, just ahead there came to him a sudden murmur of voices, low,\r\nlike the growling of savage beasts. There was that sort of note in it:\r\nA fierce, avid mutter, and presently, as he advanced, he made out here\r\nand there a word.\r\n\r\n“Th’ Big Gun.... You better watch your step.... Mar--”\r\n\r\nQuarrier found himself in a sort of corridor, at the far end of which\r\nproceeded the voices. It had all been done in the dark, so to speak.\r\nThe taxi, that driver with the face familiar and yet unfamiliar, the\r\nattack, and now this. But time pressed. Why they had not murdered\r\nhim out of hand he did not pause to consider; he knew only that\r\nMarston--and he was certain that it was Marston’s hand that had been\r\nin it--would, with a clear field, be at the hiding-place of those\r\ndocuments. Even now, doubtless, he was there.\r\n\r\nQuarrier felt mechanically for his pistol; and then his hand dropped\r\nhopelessly as he remembered that he was weaponless.\r\n\r\nHe listened tensely, holding his breath, as the voices receded--or,\r\nrather, one of them; he could hear the other following the departing\r\nman with his complaints.\r\n\r\nEvidently they had left a guard of two. One of them was going; the\r\nother left behind, and not especially delighted with his job.\r\n\r\nAn abrupt turn of the long hallway brought this man suddenly into plain\r\nview.\r\n\r\nQuarrier blinked in the glare from the single incandescent, flattening\r\nhimself against the wall; then, with a pantherish pace, he had covered\r\nthe intervening space in three lunging strides.\r\n\r\nThe man, a broad fellow with a seamed, lead-colored countenance,\r\nturned his head; his mouth opened, his hand going to his pocket with a\r\nlightning stab of the blunt, hairy fingers.\r\n\r\nBut Quarrier had wasted no time. Even as the giant reached for his gun\r\nQuarrier’s fist swung in a short arc, and there was power in it. The\r\nblow, traveling a scant six inches, crashed full on the point; the\r\nthick-set man, his eyes glazing, swayed, slipped, fell in an aimless\r\nhuddle.\r\n\r\n“Well--a knockout!” panted Quarrier, reaching for the pistol.\r\n\r\nMarston was the “Big Gun”, of course. Quarrier had never doubted\r\nit; but hitherto the President of Intervale Steel had conducted his\r\nbrokerage business, on the surface at any rate, without resort to open\r\nviolence. And Intervale Steel--You knew really nothing about it until\r\nyou took a flyer in it; then, as it might chance, you knew enough and\r\nmore than enough.\r\n\r\nQuarrier, glancing at the unconscious man and pocketing the pistol,\r\ndeparted without more ado; proceeding along the hall, he found, with no\r\nfurther adventure, a narrow door, and the pale stars, winking at him\r\nfrom, he judged, a midnight horizon.\r\n\r\nBut a glance at his watch told him that it was but nine-thirty; there\r\nwas yet time to get to the hiding-place of those documents ahead of\r\nMarston, if, as he was now convinced, it had been Marston’s thugs who\r\nhad ambushed him.\r\n\r\nPlunging along the shadowy alley, after five minutes’ walk, made at a\r\nracing gait, he found a main-traveled avenue and an owl taxi, whose\r\ndriver, leaning outward, crooked a finger in invitation to this obvious\r\nfare, appearing out of the dark.\r\n\r\nQuarrier did not hesitate. The fellow might be a gunman or worse; he\r\nmust take his chance of that.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-three Jones!” he called crisply, with the words diving into the\r\ncab’s interior; then, his head out of the window, as the taxi turned\r\noutward from the curb:\r\n\r\n“And drive as if all hell were after you!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _III._\r\n\r\n                         The Shape Invisible.\r\n\r\nQuarrier reached his destination without incident, but as he went up\r\nthe winding stairway of the office building to his private sanctum he\r\nwas oppressed by an uneasy sense that all was not as it should be.\r\nThose elevators--they were seldom out of order. Perhaps....\r\n\r\nBut, panting a little from his climb, he found his floor, and the door\r\nof his private office.\r\n\r\nFor just a split second he hesitated; then, unlocking the door, he\r\nflung it wide and went in.\r\n\r\nAnd then, for the third time that evening, he had another shock: for,\r\nalmost from the moment of his entry into that sound-proof chamber, he\r\nknew that he was not alone.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, there in the blaze from the electrolier, lighted by the\r\nopening of the door, he stood rigid, listening, holding his breath;\r\ncrouched, bent forward like a sprinter upon his mark.\r\n\r\nQuarrier was a big man, and well muscled; in his day he had been an\r\namateur boxer of repute. For a big man, he was quick, well-poised,\r\nsupple and controlled.\r\n\r\nA brain of ice and nerves of steel--that was Quarrier. And at that\r\nmoment he stood in need of them.\r\n\r\nHe had heard nothing, felt nothing, seen nobody--and yet he knew,\r\nbeyond any possibility of doubt, that someone or _something_ was\r\nwith him there in that sound-proof chamber, thirty stories above the\r\nstreet. And the knowledge--as certain as the fact that he, Quarrier,\r\nas yet lived and breathed--the knowledge that he was not alone was not\r\nreassuring. It was fantastic, it was incredible--but it was _true_!\r\n\r\nEverything in that private office was in plain sight; shelter there was\r\nnone for any possible intruder; and yet, by the very positive evidence\r\nof his eyes he knew, and his pulses quickened at the thought, that he\r\nwas not alone.\r\n\r\nIt had been Quarrier’s fancy to rent the small suite on the top floor\r\nof the out-of-the-way office building. He liked the view; the rooms\r\nwere remote; they suited his purpose; they were private. Anything could\r\nhappen here, and no one be the wiser: the crash of a heavy .45, for\r\ninstance, would not penetrate an inch outward beyond those sound-proof\r\nwalls. And a cry, a shout would be lost there just as a stone is lost,\r\ndropped downward into a deep well of silence--and of oblivion.\r\n\r\nNow, if Quarrier’s man, Harrison, a soft-footed, super-efficient\r\nbody-servant, had not kept on his hat; or if, say, he had not had a\r\nparticularly abundant shock of hair, added to the fact that although an\r\nexcellent servant, he was somewhat deaf; and if, too, he had not, for\r\nonce, walked and worked in deviousness--this chronicle would have had a\r\nvery different ending--for Quarrier, at any rate.\r\n\r\nHis hand in the pocket of his coat, the fingers curled about the butt\r\nof the automatic that he had taken from the guard back there in the\r\ncellar, Quarrier, frowning, surveyed the room in a slow, searching\r\nappraisal. Those documents--he had to make certain of them.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right, as his gaze went round the chamber, he saw a\r\nbook-case, a full-length canvas, done in oils, the double windows, a\r\ndoor, locked with a huge, old-fashioned key, leading into a lumber-room\r\njust beyond, a small wall safe, his desk--which completed the circle.\r\n\r\nThe room was in itself a safe. It was like a fort: The windows were\r\nprotected by sheet-steel aprons similar to the burglar-guards used\r\nby bank tellers; the main entrance door, through which Quarrier had\r\nentered, and which opened upon the corridor and the elevators, was of\r\nsteel, with a patent spring combination lock; the other door, leading\r\nto the lumber-room, was also of steel, locked, however, with a huge,\r\nold-fashioned key, but this latter door had never been in use since\r\nQuarrier’s occupancy.\r\n\r\nNothing short of an acetylene blowpipe could have penetrated the walls,\r\nthe ceiling, the floor, but they were smooth, unmarred by scratch or\r\ntell-tale stain.\r\n\r\nNow, to understand events as they occurred:\r\n\r\nQuarrier was in his private sanctum, his office; it adjoined the\r\nlumber-room at the right. And a simple diagram may serve perhaps\r\nbetter than a page of explanation:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe electrolier, blazing from its four nitro lamps, illumined every\r\nnook and cranny of that office; shed its blazing effulgence upon\r\nQuarrier, standing like a graven image before that wall safe. And as he\r\nstood there, for the first time in his well-ordered existence a prey to\r\nfear, a face rose out of his consciousness; he heard again the voice of\r\nMarston, President of Intervale Steel:\r\n\r\n“You have them, my dear Quarrier; keep them--safe.”\r\n\r\nQuarrier had never liked Marston; the man was elusive, like an eel; you\r\nnever saw his hand: it was impossible to guess what moved behind the\r\nmask-like marble of his face, expressionless always, cold, contained.\r\n\r\nBut Quarrier had the “documents,” or, rather, they were there, in that\r\nwall safe, in itself a small fort of chrome-nickel steel and manganese\r\nagainst which no mere “can-opener” could have prevailed--no torch, even.\r\n\r\nNow, as he operated the combination, he was abruptly sensible of a\r\ncurious sensation of strain; a shock; the short hairs at the back of\r\nhis neck prickled suddenly as if at the touch of an invisible, icy\r\nfinger. And for a moment he could have sworn to a Presence just behind\r\nhim--a something in ambush grinning at his back--a danger, a real and\r\ndaunting peril, the greater that it was unmeasured and unknown.\r\n\r\nBut with his fingers upon that dial, Quarrier half turned as if to\r\ndepart. He was getting jumpy, his nerves out of hand--too much coffee\r\nand too many strong cigars, perhaps. That was it. That kidnapping; it\r\nmight, after all, have had nothing to do with Marston. The documents\r\nwere safe--they simply had to be. Unless Marston had been there, and\r\ngone; but he would scarcely have had time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, too, Quarrier might have obeyed the impulsion of that turning\r\nmovement, and in that case, also, this story would never have been\r\nwritten. Quarrier might have done this, but for the moment, practical\r\nand sanely balanced as he was, for a split second he had the fancy that\r\nif he turned his head he would see--something that was not good, that\r\nwas not--well--normal.\r\n\r\nIt was instinctive, elemental, rather than rational, and, getting\r\nhimself in hand, he would, doubtless, have turned abruptly, leaving the\r\nroom, if, at that moment, out of the tail of his eye, he had not seen\r\nthe inescapable evidence of a presence other than his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IV._\r\n\r\n                          The Silent Witness.\r\n\r\nQuarrier was a large man, and hard-muscled, a dangerous adversary in a\r\nrough-and-tumble, a “good man with his hands,” as we have seen; young,\r\nand a quick thinker.\r\n\r\nIn the half of a second it came to him that Marston might have\r\ndelegated his authority (at second- or third-hand, certainly) to some\r\npeterman, some yegg, say, to obtain possession of those documents. But\r\nthe fellow would have to be a boxman par excellence; that strong-box\r\nwas the last word in safes, and, Quarrier was certain, the _final_ one.\r\n\r\nNo ordinary houseman could hope to break into it, and the marauder\r\nwould have to depend upon a finger sandpapered to the quick, hearing\r\nmicroscopically sensitive, to catch, through that barrier of steel and\r\nbronze, the whispering fall of those super-tumblers.\r\n\r\nAnd abruptly following this suggestion, a second and a more daunting\r\nthought obtruded: Suppose--just suppose, that their design held no\r\nintention of an assault upon the safe; suppose that their plan, the\r\npurpose of that nameless, invisible Presence, had included, in the\r\nfirst place, him--Quarrier? In case, after all, he had managed to\r\nescape the trap back there in the cellar? Why--they would use him; that\r\nwas it! They would force him to open the safe. The thing was simple;\r\nthere was about it, even, a suggestion of sardonic humor, but it was a\r\nhumor that did not appeal to Quarrier.\r\n\r\nUpon the instant he swung round, crouching, his hand reaching for\r\nhis pocket in a lightning stab, and coming up, level, holding the\r\nshort-barrelled automatic.\r\n\r\nThen his mouth twisted in a mirthless grin as his straining gaze beheld\r\nthe square room empty under the lights.\r\n\r\nA moment he stood, his keen, strong, thoughtful face etched deep with\r\nnew lines of worry, ears strained against the singing silence, eyes\r\nturning from door to door, and from wall to window, a pulse in his\r\ntemple throbbing jerkily to his hard-held breath. He began the circuit\r\nof the room. Walking on tiptoe, he approached the door by which he had\r\nentered, thrust into its socket the great bolt. The bolt seemed really\r\nunnecessary; the lock in itself, a spring-latch affair, was devised so\r\nthat it held the stronger for pressure from without.\r\n\r\nThe _snick_ of steel against steel rang startlingly loud in the\r\nspeaking stillness; for a moment Quarrier had a curious fancy, a\r\npremonition almost, that it was a wasted precaution--that, in effect,\r\nhe was locking and double locking that door upon an empty room--an\r\nempty strong-box. Pistol in hand, however, and starting from the door,\r\nhe began his round.\r\n\r\nThe book-case he passed with a cursory examination; nothing there. Next\r\nthe painting; a portrait of his great-uncle; it held him for a moment;\r\nthose eyes had always held him; they were “following” eyes; and now for\r\na moment it seemed to Quarrier that they held a warning, a message, a\r\ncommand. But he passed on....\r\n\r\nA heavy leather settle was next in order. With a sheepish grimace\r\nhe stooped, peering under it, straightened, going on to the double\r\nwindows. That settle had been innocent of guile, but as to the\r\nwindows--he paused an interval while he thumbed the patent steel\r\ncatches. These were shut tight, the windows black, glimmering squares\r\nagainst the windy night without.\r\n\r\nThrowing off the locks, one after the other, he pushed up the first\r\nwindow, released the steel outer apron, and then, in the very act of\r\nleaning outward into the black well beneath, he drew back, with a\r\nquick, darting glance over his shoulder as his spine prickled at a\r\nsudden, daunting thought.\r\n\r\n_What was that?_\r\n\r\nFor a heartbeat at his back he thought to hear a rustle, a movement,\r\nlike the shuffle of a swift, stealthy footfall, on the heavy pile of\r\nthe Kermanshah rug.\r\n\r\nBut once more there was nothing--no one.\r\n\r\nIt was thirty stories to the street beneath, and as he leaned there in\r\nthe window his imagination upon the instant had swayed out down to the\r\ndreadful peril of the sheer, sickening fall.\r\n\r\nHow simple it would have been for someone behind him--how easy....\r\n\r\nHe shivered, the sweat beading his forehead in a fine mist of fear. A\r\nhand on his ankle--a quick heave--and then a formless blur against the\r\nnight--the plunge--into nothingness....\r\n\r\nTurning to the right, he surveyed the heavy door leading to the\r\nlumber-room. He tried the great key, rattling the knob. The door was\r\nlocked; it was heavy, solid, substantial. A quick frown wrinkled his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n“Absurd!” he muttered, but there was an odd lack of conviction in the\r\nword. “Impossible!” he said again. “There’s nobody in the room except\r\nmyself; there _couldn’t_ be.”\r\n\r\nBut even as he spoke he knew, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that\r\nsomeone or something _had_ occupied that room but a matter of seconds\r\nprior to his entry, and if he, or whatever it was, was not there now,\r\nwhere was this invisible presence?\r\n\r\nThe presence in the room of another than himself was a physical\r\nimpossibility unless, indeed, there was, after all, a fourth\r\ndimension, into which as a man passes from sunlight into shadow, the\r\nintruder had stepped, perhaps now regarding him sardonically from that\r\ninvisible plane: A living ghost!\r\n\r\nAbsurd! And yet, there was that other fact--he had seen it: _the\r\nsilent, the voiceless, yet moving witness--the positive and irrefutable\r\nproof of a presence other than his own_.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere, in a locked, bolted, impregnable chamber, unmarked by the least\r\nsign of entry--a main door which did not have a key, responding only to\r\na combination known only to himself--a secondary door most obviously\r\nlocked, and from the inside; windows of thick glass, triple locked\r\nwith the latest in patent catches--someone or something had entered,\r\npassing, as it seemed, through bolts and bars, through walls, through\r\nsteel and stone and concrete, like a djinn, or a wraith--_through the\r\nkeyhole_?\r\n\r\nMatter-of-fact as he was, hard-headed and practical, Quarrier was aware\r\nfor an instant of a flicker of almost superstitious fear. But--rot! In\r\nall the space confined by those four walls and ceiling and floor there\r\nwas not room for concealment even for a--cat, for instance--for nothing\r\nhuman, at any rate. It was beyond him, even as the Thing that had\r\nentered was _beyond him, though at hand_.\r\n\r\nQuarrier did not believe in the supernatural with his mind; but, brave\r\nas he was by nature and training, in that moment he knew fear. But he\r\npreferred, with his intelligence, to credit Marston with it; Marston,\r\nso far as morals were considered, might have been almost anything: you\r\nsaw it in his curious eyes, with their pale irises, the flat, dead\r\ncolor of his skin, like the belly of a snake; in the grim, traplike\r\nmouth. Quarrier had never deceived himself as to the President of\r\nIntervale Steel. The thing was fantastic, unreal--and yet. It might\r\neasily be a trap, and worse. Peril, the more subtile because unknown,\r\nwas all about him; he felt it, like an emanation. What was it that the\r\npsychological sharps would call it? An aura, as of some invisible and\r\ndeadly presence, seeing, although unseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _V._\r\n\r\n                         Through The Keyhole.\r\n\r\nThe room, or office, as has been written, was impregnable to any but an\r\nassault in force, the doors invincible save by the shattering crash of\r\nhigh explosive, the windows almost equally so.\r\n\r\nQuarrier’s man, Harrison, even, would be unable to enter the room\r\nin his employer’s absence; so that, knowing the combination of the\r\nsafe, he could take nothing from it, or bring anything into it. He\r\nleft, in the rare intervals that Quarrier suffered his ministrations,\r\nalways with his master, returning likewise, if he returned at all, in\r\nQuarrier’s company.\r\n\r\nThe recluse had hedged himself about with care. Marston, with his keen,\r\ndevising brain, would face a pretty problem in the recovery of those\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nBut it was when, on an abrupt inspiration, Quarrier removed the\r\ntelephone receiver from its hook, that he became certain that it was a\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\n“Give me Schuyler 9000,” he had whispered, his voice hoarse in the\r\nblanketing silence. But even with the words he knew that the line was\r\ndead, yet it was characteristic of Quarrier that, once satisfied that\r\nthis was so, he resumed his inventory of the office where he had left\r\noff.\r\n\r\nHe had completed the circuit of the chamber with the exception of the\r\nwall safe and the small, flat-topped writing-desk by the door. From\r\nhis position he could see the desk quite easily; there was nothing\r\nand nobody either on or under it. And now, before he twirled the\r\ncombination, he laid his hand upon the doors, pulling at the handles in\r\na perfunctory testing. And then--\r\n\r\nHe recoiled, stumbling backward, as the doors swung wide with a jarring\r\n_clang_. Fingers trembling, he jerked forward a drawer--put in his\r\nhand. He withdrew it--empty. Confronted with the incredible truth--the\r\nthing which he had feared and yet had not believed--he stood, stunned.\r\n_For the documents had vanished!_\r\n\r\nEven in the midst of his excitement and dismay, Quarrier permitted\r\nhimself the ghost of a faint, wintry grin. But a few hours before he\r\nhad himself bestowed those papers in their particular resting-place,\r\nand, observing a precaution to make assurance doubly sure, he had\r\nstationed a guard at the street level, men whom he could trust. For, in\r\nthe morning he had meant to transfer those documents to that repository\r\nin the West Eighties from which Marston would never be able to retrieve\r\nthem, for with their receipt would come the final quietus of the\r\nPresident of Intervale Steel. And that was why Quarrier had called that\r\nnumber, which had not answered.\r\n\r\nNow the documents were gone and Marston was safe. But there remained a\r\nfinal thin thread of hope, and it was this:\r\n\r\nThe building, a new one, stood alone; Quarrier owned it; his enemies\r\nhad in some obscure fashion obtained that which they sought. And--this\r\nbeing so--they were in the building.\r\n\r\nQuarrier’s orders to that guard had not included the stoppage or\r\ndetention of any seeking ingress. On entering, he had been informed\r\nmerely that perhaps half a dozen, all told, had possibly preceded him.\r\nThey had trapped him--perhaps they might even succeed in expunging him\r\nfrom the record together with the evidence, but they--Marston and the\r\nrest--some or all of them were in the building; they _had_ to be.\r\n\r\nHe grinned again, a swift, tigerish grin, as he considered the trifling\r\nclue which had betrayed them. But for that he would never have\r\ndiscovered the looting of the safe.\r\n\r\nAnd it was then, as he stood, turned a little from the safe and facing\r\nthe heavy door giving on the lumber-room, that he straightened, tense,\r\nbending to the keyhole.\r\n\r\nThe door was sound-proof, as were the walls, but abruptly, as a sound\r\nheard in dreams, he had heard it: At the keyhole, a sound, or the\r\nshadow of a sound, faint and thin, but unmistakable, like the beating\r\nof a heart.\r\n\r\nAnd that sound had gone on, faint and thin, as though muffled through\r\nlayers of cotton wool, persistent, regular--the faint, scarce-audible\r\nticking of a watch.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, even while he considered and dismissed the thought\r\nthat they might have planted a time-bomb against that door, Quarrier\r\nhesitated. And then, abruptly, he knew: They were in the lumber-room;\r\nhe had surprised them; doubtless they waited, hidden, for his exit. He\r\nhad been too quick for them; they had not counted on his escape from\r\nthat cellar, and if that were so, he, Quarrier, would have something to\r\nsay as to their getaway.\r\n\r\nSilent, his automatic ready, he had opened the door into the corridor\r\nwith a slow, stealthy caution. Then he was in the corridor, searching\r\nthe thick-piled shadows, where, at the far end, a light hung between\r\nfloor and ceiling like a star. A silence held, thick, heavy, mournful,\r\ndaunting, as he began his advance--a silence burdened with a tide of\r\nthreat, sinister, whispering, alive.\r\n\r\nJust ahead of him was the first of the great batteries of elevators. A\r\npressure upon the call-bell, and in a moment he would have with him men\r\nupon whom he could rely, men who would execute his least order without\r\nquestion. And then, remembering, he desisted.\r\n\r\nFor he found it easy to believe that the same agency which had silenced\r\nhis telephone might have cut him off here also from communication, but\r\nhis finger, reaching for the signal, jerked backward, as, out of the\r\ncorner of his eye, he beheld a lance of light spring suddenly from the\r\ncrusted transom of the lumber-room door.\r\n\r\nWere they coming out?\r\n\r\n“Ha!” he breathed, deep in his throat.\r\n\r\nHe did not pause to consider how many of them there might be, or\r\nthat his faithful guardians of the gate, thirty stories below, were\r\nprobably silenced by the same sinister hand.\r\n\r\nSilently, his gun held rigid as a rock, he approached the lumber-room\r\ndoor; then, a step away, he paused, with a sharp intake of his breath.\r\n\r\nHere, six paces at his left, a narrow corridor led to a fire-alarm box\r\nand a window directly overlooking the main entrance and the street.\r\nQuarrier, back to the wall, thrust up a groping hand to where, just\r\nabove his head, a light cluster hung. Three of the bulbs he unscrewed;\r\nthen, going to the window, opened it, leaned outward, and, with\r\nintervals between, dropped them downward into the dark.\r\n\r\nThen, pistol in hand, his feet silent upon the concrete flooring of the\r\ncorridor, he approached the lumber-room door.\r\n\r\nOn hands and knees, he listened a moment at the keyhole; then, still\r\non his knees, his fingers, reaching, turned the knob, slowly, with an\r\ninfinite caution, in his face new creases, grim lines. His face bitter,\r\nbleak, mouth hard, he straightened, got to his feet, thrust inward the\r\nheavy door with one lightning movement; stepped into the lumber-room,\r\nhis gun, swung in a short arc, covering the two who faced him across\r\nthe intervening space.\r\n\r\n“Those documents, Marston,” he commanded bruskly, “I can--use them.”\r\n\r\nHis gaze, for a fleeting instant, turned to the other man, who, hands\r\nclenched at his sides, his eyes wide with sudden terror and unbelief,\r\nstared dumbly at the apparition in the doorway.\r\n\r\nBut Marston, his face gray, his hand hidden in his pocket, shrugged,\r\nsneered wryly, his hand thrust out and upward with the speed of light.\r\n\r\nBut, for the difference between time and eternity, he was not quick\r\nenough. There came a double report, roaring almost as one: Marston’s\r\nsneer blurred to a stiff, frozen grimace; he swayed, leaning forward,\r\nhis face abruptly blank; then, in a slumping fall, he crashed downward\r\nto the floor.\r\n\r\nQuarrier stooped, swept up the papers where they had fallen from the\r\ndead man’s pocket; then he turned curtly upon his body-servant.\r\n\r\n“You may go, Harrison,” he said, as if dismissing the man casually at\r\nthe end of his day’s service.\r\n\r\nBut if Harrison felt any gratitude for the implied reprieve, he turned\r\nnow to Quarrier with an eager gesture, his speech broken, agonized:\r\n\r\n“He--you must listen, sir--Mr. Quarrier,” he begged. “He--Mr.\r\nMarston--he knew me when--he knew about....”\r\n\r\nHis voice broke, faltered.\r\n\r\n“Well--?” asked Quarrier, coldly, his face expressionless.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Marston,” continued the man--“he knew--my record--I was afraid to\r\ntell you, sir. He--he found out, somehow, that I’d--been--done time,\r\nsir.... He scared me, I’ll admit--he threatened me--threatened to tell\r\nyou.... You didn’t know, of course....”\r\n\r\n“Yes--I _knew_,” explained Quarrier, simply, and at the expression in\r\nhis master’s face the valet’s own glowed suddenly as if lighted from\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n“You--_knew_--” he murmured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _VI._\r\n\r\n                         Chain of Circumstance.\r\n\r\n“But there is one thing you can tell me,” Quarrier was saying. “You had\r\nthe combination of the safe, of course; we’ll say nothing more about\r\nthat--but--how did you get in?”\r\n\r\nHarrison bent his head.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” he explained, after a moment, “it was simple, but I’d\r\nnever have thought of it but for--him.” He pointed to the silent figure\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n“Well--there are just three doors, sir, as you know,” he resumed. “The\r\nentrance door of your office, with the combination lock; the entrance\r\ndoor of the lumber-room here, both giving on the corridor; and the\r\ninside door between the lumber-room and your office. We couldn’t get\r\ninto the office by the entrance door from the hall on account of the\r\ncombination lock, but we could and did get into the lumber-room easily\r\nenough from the corridor--the door’s not even locked, as you know, sir.\r\nAnd that’s how we got into the private office--from the lumber-room,\r\nhere, through the door between.”\r\n\r\n“But how--?” began Quarrier. “That door is a steel one; it was\r\nlocked--I’ll swear to that. You didn’t jimmy it; you didn’t have a\r\nFourth Dimension handy, did you, Harrison? But--go on; it’s beyond me,\r\nI’ll confess.”\r\n\r\nHarrison permitted himself the ghost of a grin.\r\n\r\n“Why--just a newspaper, and a bit of wire, sir--that was how it was\r\ndone. I didn’t dare unlock the connecting door--beforehand, sir--from\r\nthe office side; I never had the chance. I was never alone in the\r\noffice, sir, even for a second, as you know; but there’s a clearance of\r\nnearly half an inch, sir, beneath that connecting door--just enough for\r\nthe newspaper. From the lumber-room here I pushed the paper under the\r\ndoor, into the office, and then, with the wire, it wasn’t so difficult\r\nto push the key out of the lock; the door was locked from the office\r\nside, of course.\r\n\r\n“The key fell on the paper; we pulled the paper with the key on it back\r\nunder the door, sir, into the lumber-room here, and--we just _unlocked_\r\nthe connecting door there, and walked into the office. Afterwards I\r\nlocked the door again, from the office side, and I just did make it out\r\nthe front door of the office, when I heard your step on the stair. _He_\r\nwas waiting for me in the lumber-room; he said it was safer. Anyway, I\r\njust did make it along the hall and into the lumber-room by the hall\r\nentrance before you came.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, a queer expression in his face.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t understand how you _knew_, if you’ll excuse me, sir--how\r\nyou suspected. Afterward, from the corridor, you saw our light when we\r\nwere ready to come out; we thought you’d gone for good, of course....\r\nBut nothing was touched, sir, except--that is--of course--” He stumbled.\r\n\r\nQuarrier silenced him with upraised hand.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t _suspect_, Harrison--I _knew_,” he said. “And I heard,\r\nthrough the keyhole of that connecting door, the ticking of that\r\nwatch of yours; it’s big enough. That helped, of course. But that was\r\nafterward. There was one little thing you overlooked, and, for the\r\nmatter of that, so did I--nearly.”\r\n\r\nThere came the sound of heavy footsteps on the concrete flooring of the\r\ncorridor, voices: His guards, summoned by Quarrier’s “light-bombs.”\r\n\r\nQuarrier continued, as if he had not heard:\r\n\r\n“Well--it was right under my eyes, but I almost missed it, at that. I\r\nsaw it moving, and I knew that something must have made it move.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, with a faint grimace of recollection.\r\n\r\n“You see--you had your hat on in the office, didn’t you?... Yes, I\r\nthought so. You’re a bit deaf, too.... Well, you should have been--to\r\nMarston. But that’s past. And you have a good, thick crop of hair--_so\r\nfar_.”\r\n\r\nQuarrier smiled frostily. “Well, you struck against it and set it\r\nmoving--that was all. You never noticed it. Because it was--_the chain\r\nfrom the electrolier_, Harrison, and that was how--”\r\n\r\n“You caught us, sir! I--I’m glad. You might call it a--”\r\n\r\n“--Chain of circumstance,” finished Quarrier, his eyes outward, gazing\r\ninto the new dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _The_\r\n                           Place of Madness\r\n\r\n                       _By_ Merlin Moore Taylor\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nonsense. A penitentiary is not intended to be a place for coddling\r\nand pampering those who have broken the law.”\r\n\r\nStevenson, chairman of the Prison Commission, waved a fat hand in the\r\ndirection of the convict standing at the foot of the table.\r\n\r\n“This man,” he went on, “has learned in some way that the newspapers\r\nare ‘gunning’ for the warden and he is seizing the opportunity to make\r\na play for sympathy in his own behalf. I’ll admit that these tales he\r\ntells of brutality toward the prisoners are well told, but I believe\r\nthat he is stretching the facts. They can’t be true. Discipline must be\r\nmaintained in a place like this even if it requires harsh measures to\r\ndo it at times.”\r\n\r\n“There is no call for brutality, however,” exclaimed the convict,\r\nbreaking the rule that prisoners must not speak unless they are spoken\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThen, ignoring the chairman’s upraised hand, he went on: “We are\r\ntreated like beasts here! If a man so much as opens his mouth to ask a\r\ncivil and necessary question, the reply is a blow. Dropping a knife or\r\na fork or a spoon at the table is punished by going without the next\r\nmeal. Men too ill to work are driven to the shops with the butts of\r\nguns. Petty infractions of the most trivial rules mean the dark cell\r\nand a diet of bread and water.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what the dark cell is? ‘Solitary’ they call it here.\r\n‘Hell’ would be a better name. Steel all around you, steel walls, steel\r\ndoor, steel ceiling, steel floor. Not a cot to lie upon, not even a\r\nstool to sit upon. Nothing but the bare floor. And darkness! Not a ray\r\nof light ever penetrates the dark cell once the door is closed upon\r\nyou. No air comes to you except through a small ventilator in the roof.\r\nAnd even that has an elbow to keep the light away from you.\r\n\r\n“Is it any wonder that even the most refractory prisoner comes out of\r\nthere broken--broken in mind, in body, in spirit? And some of them go\r\ninsane--stark, staring mad--after only a few hours of it. And for what?\r\nI spent two days in ‘solitary’ because I collapsed from weakness at my\r\nbench in the shoe factory.\r\n\r\n“See this scar?” He pointed to a livid mark over one eye. “A guard did\r\nthat with the barrel of his rifle because I was unable to get up and\r\ngo back to work when he told me. He knocked me senseless, and when I\r\ncame to I was in ‘solitary.’ Insubordination, they called it. Two days\r\nthey kept me in there when I ought to have been in a hospital. Two days\r\nof hell and torture because I was ill. People prate of reforming men\r\nin prison. It’s the other way around. It makes confirmed criminals of\r\nthem--if they don’t go mad first.”\r\n\r\nThe chairman wriggled in his seat and cleared his throat impatiently.\r\n\r\n“We have listened to you for quite a while, my man,” he said\r\npompously, “but I, for one, have enough. A dozen or more prisoners\r\nhave testified here today, and none of them has made a statement to\r\nback up the charges you have made.”\r\n\r\n“And why?” demanded the prisoner. “Because they are afraid to tell the\r\ntruth. They know that they would be beaten and starved and deprived of\r\ntheir ‘good time’ on one excuse or another if they even hinted at what\r\nthey know. You wouldn’t believe them, anyhow. You don’t believe me, yet\r\nI probably shall suffer for what I have said here. But that doesn’t\r\nmatter. They can’t take any ‘good time’ away from me. I’m in for life.”\r\n\r\nHis voice grew bitter.\r\n\r\n“And that is one reason I have gone into this thing in detail--for my\r\nsake and the sake of others who cannot look forward to ever leaving\r\nthis place. The law has decreed that we shall live and die here, but\r\nthe law said nothing about torturing us.”\r\n\r\n“This board guaranteed its protection to all who were called upon to\r\ntestify here,” answered the chairman. “It has no desire to whitewash\r\nany person in connection with the investigation which is being made,\r\nand in order that there might be no reflection upon the manner in which\r\nthis hearing is conducted neither the warden, his deputies nor guards\r\nhave been permitted to attend. Unless you have tangible evidence to\r\noffer us and can give the names of those who can back up your charges,\r\nyou may go.”\r\n\r\n“Just a minute.” It was the board member nearest the prisoner who\r\ninterrupted. Then, to the convict, “You said, I believe, that only a\r\nfew hours in the dark cell often will drive a man insane. Yet you spent\r\ntwo days there. You are not insane, are you?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.” The convict spoke respectfully. “My conscience was clear and\r\nI was able to serve my time there without breaking. But another day or\r\nso would have finished me. You testified against me at my trial, didn’t\r\nyou? I hold no grudge against you for that, sir. I give you credit for\r\ndoing only what you thought was your duty. Your testimony clinched the\r\ncase against me. Yet I am innocent--”\r\n\r\nThe chairman rapped sharply upon the table.\r\n\r\n“I utterly fail to see what all this has to do with the matter under\r\ninvestigation,” he protested irritably. “We are not trying this man’s\r\ncase. The courts have passed upon that. He is just like all the rest.\r\nAny one of them is ready to swear on a stack of Bibles that he is\r\ninnocent. Let’s get on with this investigation.”\r\n\r\nThe convict bowed silently and turned toward the door beyond which the\r\nguards were waiting to conduct him back to his cell. A hand upon his\r\narm detained him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chairman,” said Blalock, the member who had questioned the\r\nprisoner, “I request that this man be permitted to go on with what he\r\nwas saying. I shall have no more questions to ask. You were saying”--he\r\nprompted the man beside him.\r\n\r\n“I was saying that I was innocent,” resumed the convict. “I was about\r\nto add that not even a man who is guiltless of wrongdoing would be able\r\nto withstand the terrors of solitary for any length of time. You, for\r\ninstance, are a physician, a man of sterling reputation against whom\r\nno one ever has breathed a word. Yet I doubt that you could endure\r\nseveral hours in the dark cell. If you would only try it, you would\r\nknow for yourself that I have spoken the truth. Gentlemen, I beg of you\r\nto do all in your power to abolish the dark cell. Men can stand just\r\nso much without cracking, and if you will dig into the facts you will\r\nfind that nine times out of ten it is men broken in ‘solitary’ who are\r\nresponsible for the outbreaks in prison. That is all.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed respectfully and was gone.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Clever talker, that fellow,” commented the secretary of the\r\ncommission, breaking the silence. “He almost had me believing him. Who\r\nis he, Blalock? You had him summoned, I believe.”\r\n\r\nThe physician nodded.\r\n\r\n“I confess it was as much from personal interest in the man as from any\r\nhope that he might give valuable evidence here,” he said. “He surprised\r\nme with his outburst. He is a clever talker. Ellis is his name--Martin\r\nEllis--and he comes of a splendid and well-to-do family. University\r\ngraduate and quite capable of having carved out a wonderful career. But\r\nhe was idolized at home and given more money than was good for him. It\r\nmade him an idler and a young ne’er-do-well. But whatever he did he\r\ndid openly, and I never heard of anything seriously wrong until he was\r\nconvicted of the crime which brought him here.”\r\n\r\n“Murder, I suppose?” Stevenson, the chairman, was interested in spite\r\nof himself. “He spoke of being in for life.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; killing a girl. Agnes Keller was her name. Poor, but well thought\r\nof. Church worker, member of the choir and so on. It was brought out\r\nat the trial--in fact, Ellis told it himself--that he was infatuated\r\nwith her and they were together a great deal. Not openly, of course,\r\nbecause old man Ellis, his father, would have pawed up the earth. The\r\naffair ended like all these clandestine affairs, specially if the girl\r\nis young and pretty and poor. It was the theory of the prosecution that\r\nwhen she discovered her condition she became frantic and demanded that\r\nEllis marry her, the alternative being that she would go to his father\r\nwith the story. It was charged that he killed her to avoid making a\r\nchoice. The evidence against him was purely circumstantial, but the\r\njury held it was conclusive.\r\n\r\n“Ellis admitted on the stand that they often went riding in his\r\nmotor-car at night. One damning fact against him was that he was seen\r\ndriving, alone and rapidly, along the country lane near where her body\r\nwas found. He had nothing to back up his claim that he felt ill and\r\nwent for a drive in an effort to relieve a sick headache. Of course he\r\ndenied absolutely that he was responsible for her condition, or that\r\nhe even knew of it, but the jury was out less than an hour. The only\r\nhitch, I learned later, was whether to affix the death penalty or not.”\r\n\r\n“He said you were a witness against him. What part did you play?” asked\r\nStevenson.\r\n\r\n“An unwilling one,” answered Blalock, quickly. “I did not believe that\r\nEllis was guilty then. I am not convinced of it now. But as the girl’s\r\nphysician, and presumably one of those to whom she would go in her\r\ntrouble, I was questioned as soon as the coroner had held an autopsy.\r\nI admitted that she had confided in me and that I had agreed that the\r\nman responsible should marry her. She did not tell me his name, but\r\nmy evidence added weight to the theory that Ellis killed her to avoid\r\nmarrying her.”\r\n\r\nThe door to the room swung open and the warden stood on the threshold.\r\n\r\n“May I come in?” he asked. “Dinner is almost ready and I thought I had\r\nbetter give you warning.”\r\n\r\nHe crossed to an empty chair and sat down.\r\n\r\n“We concluded the taking of evidence quite a little while ago,” said\r\nthe chairman. “Since then Dr. Blalock has been entertaining us with\r\nthe story of the crime of that fellow Martin Ellis who was one of the\r\nwitnesses. Quite unusual.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the sheriff who brought him here told me all about it,” answered\r\nthe warden. “He’s hard to handle. Had trouble with one of the guards a\r\nwhile back and we had to discipline him.”\r\n\r\n“Two days in the solitary cell on bread and water, wasn’t it?” asked\r\nBlalock. “He didn’t have any good words for it.”\r\n\r\nThe warden flushed.\r\n\r\n“Few of those who taste of it do,” he admitted. “Too much a matter of\r\nbeing left alone with your thoughts and your conscience. They’ll punish\r\nyou as much as anything can do. Well, suppose you take an adjournment\r\nand come on to dinner? Will you want to make the regular inspection\r\ntour of the prison?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure,” yawned the chairman. “Undoubtedly, everything is all right,\r\nas usual, but if we omitted it the newspapers would have something to\r\nhowl about.”\r\n\r\nHe rose, and, with the rest of the commission trailing them, followed\r\nthe warden to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s make the inspection and have it over with,” Stevenson\r\nsuggested, when the meal was finished. “Where do we go first, warden?”\r\n\r\n“Through the shops and smaller buildings first, then the cells. That\r\nway you’ll end up closest to the administration building and you can go\r\nback into conference with the least delay.”\r\n\r\nUniformed guards stood smartly at attention as the warden piloted\r\nthe commission through. “Trusties” ingratiatingly hovered about the\r\nparty, eager to be of service. Great steel-barred doors swung open at\r\nthe approach of the commission and clanged to noisily behind it. The\r\nafternoon sunlight, slanting through the bars, relieved the somberness\r\nof the cell blocks and revealed them in their spick-and-spanness, made\r\nready for the occasion.\r\n\r\n“Well, everything seems to be O. K.,” said the chairman, as the party\r\nagain drew near to the offices. “Anyone else got any suggestions?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’d like to see the dark cell,” answered the secretary. “I don’t\r\nrecall ever visiting it, and that fellow Ellis interested me. He said\r\nit was a pocket edition of Hades. Where is it, warden?”\r\n\r\nThe warden assumed a jocular air.\r\n\r\n“You’ll be disappointed,” he warned. “It’s down in the basement, where\r\nprisoners who want to do so can yell and scream to their hearts’\r\ncontent without disturbing anyone. A trifle dark, of course, but if to\r\nsome it is hell it is because they choose to make it so. If you really\r\nwant to see it, come ahead. It’s not occupied, however.”\r\n\r\nHe did not mention that he had seen to that. With all this uproar\r\nabout the management of the prison, it wasn’t safe to take chances.\r\nThe commission, he had foreseen, might decide to make a _real_\r\ninvestigation, and you never could tell in just what condition a man\r\nwould be after several hours in “solitary.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“There you are gentlemen?” he said, with a flourish of the hand when a\r\n“trusty” had switched on the lights in the basement. “Not _one_ dark\r\ncell, but half a dozen.”\r\n\r\nHe stood back as the members of the commission crowded forward and\r\npeered into the dark recesses. Over each doorway a single electric\r\nbulb shone weakly, far too weakly for the rays to penetrate into the\r\ncorners. The solid, bolt-studded doors stood open, formidable and\r\nforbidding.\r\n\r\n“Any of you want to try it?” asked the warden from the background.\r\n\r\n“Sure, let Blalock take a whirl at one of them,” suggested the\r\nsecretary. “His conscience ought to be clear enough not to trouble him.\r\nGo on, doctor; try it and let us know how it feels. I’d do it myself,\r\nbut I don’t dare risk _my_ conscience.”\r\n\r\nBlalock, standing just inside the doorway of one of the cells, turned\r\nand for a moment surveyed them in silence.\r\n\r\n“Your suggestion, of course, was made in jest,” he said. “But,” a\r\nsudden ring came into his voice, “I am going to take you up on it! No,”\r\nas a chorus of exclamations came from the others, “my mind is quite\r\nmade up. Warden, I want this as realistic as possible. You will please\r\nprovide me with a suit of the regulation convict clothing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, of all the blamed fools,” ejaculated the chairman. Then he gave\r\nhis shoulders a shrug. “Go on and get a zebra suit, warden. I only hope\r\nthis doesn’t get into the papers.”\r\n\r\nA “trusty” was dispatched for the striped suit. When it had been\r\nbrought Blalock already had removed his outer garments, amid the\r\nbantering of the others. He did not deign to answer them until he had\r\nbuttoned about him the prison jacket and jammed upon his head the\r\nlittle striped cap.\r\n\r\n“I guess I’m ready,” he said then. “You gentlemen have seen fit to\r\nridicule the experiment I am about to make. But I say to you that I\r\nam doing this in all seriousness. I do not believe that ‘solitary’ is\r\nas bad as Ellis pictured it to us. I am going to find out. Warden, you\r\nwill please see that conditions here are made exactly like those which\r\nsurround a prisoner in this place.”\r\n\r\nHe whirled upon his heel and strode into a cell.\r\n\r\n“How long do you want to be left in there?” asked the warden. “Fifteen\r\nminutes or so?”\r\n\r\n“Ellis declared his belief that I could not stand it for an hour or\r\ntwo,” came the reply from the depths of the cell. “Suppose that we make\r\nit two hours. At the end of that time you may return and release me.\r\nBut not a minute before.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Number 9982,” replied the warden. “You now are alone with\r\nyour conscience.”\r\n\r\nThe heavy door clanged shut, and a faint _click_ told Blalock that the\r\nlight above the door had been snapped off. Then the sound of footsteps,\r\ngrowing fainter and fainter, the _clang_ of the door leading to the\r\nbasement--then silence. Blalock was alone.\r\n\r\nFeeling with his hands, he made his way to a corner of the cell and sat\r\ndown upon the bare, hard floor.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes and set about concentrating his mind upon some subject\r\nother than the fact that he was a prisoner, of his own free will to be\r\nsure, but a prisoner nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHe always had prided himself upon the fact that he had the ability\r\nto drive from his thoughts at will all topics but the one which he\r\ndesired. Now, he chose, at random, to begin preparing an outline of a\r\nlecture which he was scheduled to deliver within two weeks before a\r\nconvention of medical men.\r\n\r\nBack home in his study, Blalock was accustomed to stretching out at\r\nlength in an easy chair, his feet upon a stool, a pillow beneath his\r\nhead. Here his legs were stretched out upon the floor at night angles\r\nto his body, held bolt upright by the steel wall at his back. He sought\r\nto relieve the strain by keeping his knees in the air, but the floor\r\noffered no firm foothold and his heels slipped.\r\n\r\nIrritated, Blalock slid away from the corner and tried lying upon his\r\nback, his eyes staring up into the darkness above him. Immediately that\r\nposition, too, grew irksome and he turned over upon first one side,\r\nthen the other, and finally he got upon his feet and leaned against\r\nthe wall. Thus another fifteen or twenty minutes passed, he judged.\r\nHe found that it was impossible to concentrate his thoughts, so he\r\nresolved to let them wander.\r\n\r\nLeaning against the wall speedily proved uncomfortable, and Blalock\r\nbegan to pace around and around the narrow confines of the cell. Four\r\npaces one way, two at right angles, then four, then two. It reminded\r\nhim of a big bear he once had watched in a zoo, striding back and forth\r\nbehind the bars, but never very far from the door which shut him off\r\nfrom the outside world and freedom.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Blalock discovered that he had made the circuit so many times\r\nin the darkness that he was turned around, that he did not know at\r\nwhich end lay the door to the cell. He began to hunt for it, feeling\r\nwith his sensitive surgeon’s fingers for the place where the door\r\nfitted into the wall of the cell.\r\n\r\nIt annoyed him, after making two trips around, that he had failed to\r\nlocate the door. He could tell by counting the corners as he came\r\nto them. The door fitted into its casing so well that he could not\r\ndistinguish it from the grooves where the plates of the cell were\r\njoined together.\r\n\r\nImmediately it became to him the most important thing in the world to\r\nknow where lay that door. He thought of sounding the walls to see if at\r\nsome point they would not give back a different sound and thus tell him\r\nwhat he felt he must know.\r\n\r\nIt was becoming a mania with him now. So, gently, he began rapping\r\nwith his knuckles against the steel, here, there, in one place, then\r\nin another. Then he tried it all over with his ear, trained to detect,\r\neven without the aid of a stethoscope, the variations in the beating\r\nof a human heart, pressed close against the walls.\r\n\r\nBut again he was foiled. Every spot gave forth the same hollow sound.\r\n\r\nAngered, Blalock kicked viciously against the insensate steel. Shooting\r\npains in his maltreated toes rewarded him and, with a growl of anguish,\r\nhe dropped to the floor to nurse the injured members.\r\n\r\nThen he became aware that his hands were stickily saturated, and he\r\nknew, when he discovered that his knuckles were skinned and raw, that\r\nit was his own blood. Desperately he fought to regain his self-control\r\nin an effort to force himself to be bland and unruffled when the warden\r\nshould come to release him, as Blalock felt sure would be the case in\r\nonly a few minutes at most.\r\n\r\nHe caught himself listening intently for the footsteps of the warden,\r\nor some “trusty” or guard sent to release him. He strained his ears to\r\ncatch the far-away clang which would indicate that someone was coming\r\ninto the basement.\r\n\r\nBut only the hissing sound of his own breath broke the tense silence.\r\nFunny he thought, how very still things could be. It required no\r\nvery big stretch of the imagination to picture himself as really\r\na recalcitrant prisoner, slapped in ‘solitary’ to ponder upon his\r\nmisdeeds.\r\n\r\nGoing further, he recalled a story, which he had read long ago, of a\r\nman who found himself to be the only living human being, the others\r\nhaving been wiped out in the flicker of an eyelash by some mysterious\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nWhy didn’t the warden come on and let him out of here? Surely the two\r\nhours were up, and he was getting tired of it!\r\n\r\nIt would never do, however, to be caught in this frame of mind when he\r\nwas released. He must emerge smiling and ready to give the lie to that\r\nclever talker, Ellis.\r\n\r\nOnce more he got up and began his circuit of the walls. He felt that he\r\nwas master of himself again, and it would do no harm to try to solve\r\nthe puzzle of the door that would not be found.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the warden had been delayed by some unexpected happening. Oh,\r\nwell, a few minutes longer wouldn’t make any difference. Suppose that\r\nhe were in Ellis’ place! In for life! He didn’t want to think of Ellis.\r\nBut somehow the face of the “lifer” kept obtruding itself--his face and\r\nhis words.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that Ellis had said? “You, for instance, are a physician, a\r\nman of sterling reputation, against whom no one ever breathed a word.\r\nYet I doubt if you could endure several hours in the dark cell.”\r\n\r\nAnd the warden had added that in the dark cell a man was alone with his\r\nconscience. Damn that warden! Where was he, anyhow? Blalock began to\r\ndislike him. Perhaps there was something in those stories of brutality\r\nwhich the newspapers had printed, after all.\r\n\r\nDislike for the warden began to give way to hate. Blalock wondered if\r\nthe warden and that fat, pompous little Stevenson, chairman of the\r\ncommission, hadn’t got their heads together and decided it would be\r\na good joke to let him stay in there a great deal longer than he had\r\nordered. He would show them, once he got out, that he didn’t relish\r\nthat kind of a joke, that he wasn’t a man to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nThus another hour passed, as he reckoned it, and his anger and passion\r\ngot the best of him. He kicked the walls and hammered upon them with\r\nhis clenched fists, insensible to the fact that he was injuring himself.\r\n\r\nThen came fear--fear that he had been forgotten!\r\n\r\nSuppose that there had been an outbreak in the prison, that the\r\nconvicts were in control! Would they release him? Might they not wreak\r\ntheir vengeance upon him in the absence of another victim?\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe began to call, moderately at first and pausing often to listen for\r\nsome response; then louder and louder, until he was screaming without\r\ncessation.\r\n\r\nHe cursed and swore, pleaded and cajoled, threatened and sought to\r\nbribe by turns, demanding only that he be taken from this terrible\r\nplace. He was dead to the fact that it was impossible for anyone to\r\nhear him, that only the reverberation of his own voice, thunderous in\r\nthat narrow place, answered him. Beating down from the ceiling, thrown\r\nup from the floor, cast back into his teeth by the walls, the noise of\r\nhis own making overwhelmed him, crushed him.\r\n\r\nStark terror held him in its icy grip now. His thoughts pounded through\r\nhis brain like water in a mill race. The perspiration fell from him in\r\nrivulets as he hammered and smashed at the walls. His brain was afire.\r\nHe began to realize that what Ellis had said very easily could be true.\r\nMen _did_ go mad in this place! Why, he was going mad himself--mad from\r\nthe torture his body was undergoing, mad from being alone with his own\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nThere were more lucid moments when reason desperately sought to assert\r\nitself. Blalock’s cries became less violent and, moaning and sobbing\r\nsoftly, he began all over again that endless circuit of the cell in\r\nsearch of the door. Failing, he raved again and staggered from wall to\r\nwall or leaped madly toward the ceiling as if, by some miracle, escape\r\nmight lie in that direction.\r\n\r\nExhausted at last, he sank to the floor, poignantly conscious that\r\ninterminable nights and days were passing over his head and that thirst\r\nand hunger, keen and excruciating, held him in their grasp.\r\n\r\nAt intervals, strength would come back to him, strength, backed by\r\nindomitable will power that sent him lunging to his feet to renew his\r\nbattering at the walls, his frenzied shouts and screeches, in just one\r\nmore effort to make himself heard.\r\n\r\nHis knuckles were broken and bleeding, his lips cracked and swollen;\r\nhis voice came out shrilly from his dry and wracked throat, his body\r\nand legs were succumbing to a great weariness that would not be denied.\r\n\r\nCame the time at last when his own voice no longer dinned into his\r\nears, when his legs refused to obey the will that commanded them to\r\nhoist him upon his feet, when he no longer could lift his hands. His\r\nspirit was broken at last, and he gave up the struggle and sank back\r\nupon the floor. And all around him the darkness shut down--the darkness\r\nand the silence.\r\n\r\nThen the door was thrown open, and, framed in silhouette against the\r\nlight beyond, stood the warden.\r\n\r\n“Got enough, doctor?” he called out cheerily. “Your two hours are\r\nup.... Why don’t you answer me? Dr. Blalock! What’s wrong, man?”\r\n\r\nHe peered into the cell in a vain endeavor to force his eyes to\r\npenetrate the darkness. Failing, he fumbled in his clothes for a match\r\nand, with hands that shook, scratched it against the door.\r\n\r\nThen his face went white as a sheet, he staggered where he stood and\r\nthe match burned down to the flesh of his hands and scorched it. For\r\nin the far corner he had perceived, flat upon its back, a haggard,\r\nbloodstained, white-haired thing that winked and blinked at him with\r\nvacant eyes and muttered and gibbered incoherently.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReason came back to Blalock one day many weeks later.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes with the light of understanding in them, and they\r\ntold him from his surrounding that he was in a hospital. Outside, the\r\nsun was shining brightly, and in a little park, just beyond, birds were\r\nsinging and the breeze brought him the sound of children at play.\r\n\r\n“Awake at last, are you?” asked the white-capped nurse who came into\r\nthe room just then.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Blalock, in a rasping whisper. He did not know it then, but\r\nthe calm, soothing voice he once had boasted was his best asset in a\r\nsick room, was gone forever. The terrific strain to which he had put\r\nhis vocal cords in his paroxysms in the dark cell had shattered them.\r\n\r\n“You are doing splendidly,” the nurse assured him brightly. “You have\r\nbeen seriously ill, but you are recovering rapidly now.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Blalock positively, as one who knows. “I shall never get\r\nwell. Give me a mirror, please.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe there is one handy,” she evaded, loath to let him see\r\nthe havoc in his face.\r\n\r\nBut he insisted.\r\n\r\n“Please,” he begged, “I am prepared and I do not think I will be\r\novercome. I will be brave.”\r\n\r\nReluctantly, then, she started to place the silvered glass in his\r\nhand. As he reached out to take it, he stopped, his hand half-way. The\r\nhand he was accustomed to see, with its tapering fingers and well-kept\r\nnails, the hand that so deftly had performed delicate operations, was\r\ngone. Instead was a slim, clawlike thing, with distorted knuckles and\r\njoints.\r\n\r\nBlalock finally extended it, took the mirror and, slowly but steadily,\r\nbrought it into line with his eyes. He had expected some changes, but\r\nnot the sight that greeted him. The black, wavy hair had given place to\r\nlocks of snowy white. His face was drawn and wrinkled, and lack-luster\r\neyes stared back at him from cavernous sockets. Long he gazed at this\r\napparition, then silently he let the mirror fall upon the cover and\r\nclosed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Don’t take it so hard, doctor,” begged the nurse. “You have been\r\nthrough a harrowing experience and your face shows it now. But in a\r\nshort time--” The lie did not come easily, and her tongue faltered.\r\n\r\n“Never mind that,” whispered Blalock. “It doesn’t matter now. Send for\r\nStevenson, please.”\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Prison Commission came without delay. Compelling\r\nhimself to conceal the repulsion he felt at sight of the broken man\r\nupon the bed, he bustled in with forced pleasantries.\r\n\r\n“Stevenson,” said Blalock when finally the other had taken a chair and\r\nthe nurse had withdrawn. “I have something to tell you. That day I went\r\ninto the dark cell--”\r\n\r\n“Now, now, old man,” soothed Stevenson, laying a restraining hand upon\r\nthe other’s arm. “Don’t let’s talk about that. We abolished it that\r\nvery day. Why bring up that awful experience of yours? No one knows\r\nabout it but the commission, the warden and your doctor and nurse here.\r\nWe all are pledged not to talk about it, and the newspapers didn’t\r\nhave a line except that you were taken ill. Let the past take care of\r\nitself, Blalock, old man, and let us talk of other things.”\r\n\r\nA flash of the old will power shone in the sick man’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said firmly. “No, Stevenson, the past cannot take care of\r\nitself. Bend closer, Stevenson, I must tell you something, and it seems\r\nI’m not strong enough yet to talk out loud.\r\n\r\n“That day I so boastfully demanded that I be locked up in ‘solitary.’\r\nI thought I knew myself and my will power. I believed that I had\r\nsuch control over my mind and my body that I could defy any torture\r\nman might devise, without quailing--despite the knowledge that my\r\nconscience was not the lily-white thing I had led others to believe it\r\nwas. For, Stevenson, my conscience was black--as black as hell! It held\r\nthe knowledge of a great sin on my part, a huge wrong that had been\r\ndone another.\r\n\r\n“But I had stifled it by my will power until I believed it a thing that\r\nwas dead, that could never throw off the bondage to which I had doomed\r\nit, and arise and accuse me. It was to prove that I was superior to it\r\nthat I deliberately chose to be locked up with it where, alone with my\r\nthoughts, I could prove myself the master, once for all.\r\n\r\n“For Martin Ellis had shaken my confidence. Where before I had been\r\ncertain I was doubtful, I wanted to prove him a liar and at the same\r\ntime satisfy myself that I was a free man and not the galley slave of\r\nthat thing which we call a guilty conscience.\r\n\r\n“In that cell, that conscience which I believed I had killed rose up to\r\nshow me it had been but sleeping. Under other conditions it might have\r\nslept on indefinitely. In there it overwhelmed me with a sense of its\r\npower and made me feel that I was about to meet my God without even\r\nso much as a veil behind which to hide my guilty thoughts. No matter\r\nwhich way I turned I saw an accusing finger pointing at me out of the\r\ndarkness and the solitude was shattered by a voice which cried out that\r\nthose who sin must pay and pay and pay until the slate is wiped clean.\r\nAnd I had sinned, but I had not paid.\r\n\r\n“Conscience is a terrible thing once it is aroused, Stevenson. It is\r\nliving, vibrant, and it lashes and scourges until it has exacted its\r\ntoll. That was what it did to me there in the darkness, alone and at\r\nits mercy, and with no chance to escape. And in my agony and fear I\r\ncursed the God who had created me and saddled me with this thing. I\r\nlearned my lesson, though, before I was through. I who had presumed to\r\nplace my own puny will above the Great Eternal Will; I who had dared to\r\nbelieve that the great order of things, the plan by which we all must\r\nlive and die, must make an exception of me, learned that I was wrong.\r\n\r\n“_Martin Ellis is innocent_, Stevenson, and I trust to you to see that\r\njustice is done. He did not kill Agnes Keller and I knew it. And I\r\nstood by and let him be convicted. More, I took the stand against him\r\nand helped to make that conviction certain. I told only the truth in\r\nmy testimony, but I did not tell all I knew and what I omitted would\r\nhave saved Ellis. I did not want to testify at all, but the prosecution\r\nrefused to let me take advantage of the confidential relation which is\r\nsupposed to exist between physician and patient.\r\n\r\n“The state was right in its theory that the man who strangled Agnes\r\nKeller did so because he was responsible for her condition and did not\r\nwish to marry her. She came to me in my study on the night she met her\r\ndeath and told me she had discovered she was about to become a mother.\r\n\r\n“She refused to take any steps I suggested and she said that her child,\r\nwhen it was born, must have the legal right to bear the name of its\r\nfather. And that very night she was lured into an automobile with the\r\npromise that the man who was to blame would take her to a nearby town\r\nand make her his wife. But on that lonely country road he turned upon\r\nher and killed her with his bare hands.\r\n\r\n“And how do I know these things? Because, Stevenson, I was the man\r\nresponsible for her condition, _and it was I who killed her_!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The_ Closing Hand\r\n\r\n                       _A Powerful Short Story_\r\n\r\n                        _by_ Farnsworth Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nSolitary and forbidding, the house stared specterlike through scraggly\r\ntrees that seemed to shrink from its touch.\r\n\r\nThe green moss of decay lay on its dank roofs, and the windows, set\r\nin deep cavities, peered blindly at the world as if through eyeless\r\nsockets. So forbidding was its aspect that boys, on approaching its\r\ncheerless gables, stopped their whistling and passed on the opposite\r\nside of the street.\r\n\r\nAcross the fields, a few huddled cottages gazed through the falling\r\nrain, as if wondering what family could be so bold as to take up its\r\nabode within the gloomy walls of that old mansion, whose carpetless\r\nfloors for two years had not felt the tread of human feet.\r\n\r\nIn an attic room of the house two sisters lay in bed, but not asleep.\r\nThe younger sister cringed under the dread inspired by the bleak place.\r\nThe elder laughed at her childish fears, but the younger felt the spell\r\nof the old building and was afraid.\r\n\r\n“I suppose there is really nothing to frighten me in this dreary old\r\nhouse,” she admitted, without conviction in her voice, “but the very\r\nfeel of the place is horrible. Mother shouldn’t have left us alone in\r\nthis gruesome place.”\r\n\r\n“Stupid,” her sister scolded, “with all the silverware downstairs,\r\nsomebody has to be here, for fear of burglars.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t talk about burglars!” pleaded the younger girl. “I am\r\nafraid. I keep imagining I hear ghostly footsteps.”\r\n\r\nHer sister laughed.\r\n\r\n“Go to sleep, Goosie,” she said.\r\n\r\n“‘Haunted’ houses are nothing but superstition. They exist only in\r\nimagination.”\r\n\r\n“Why has nobody lived here for two years, then? They tell me that for\r\nfive years every family moved out after being here just a short time.\r\nThe whole atmosphere of the house is ghastly. And I can’t forget how\r\nthe older Berkheim girl was found stabbed to death in her bed, and\r\nnobody ever knew how it happened. Why, she may have been murdered in\r\nthis very room!”\r\n\r\n“Go to sleep and don’t scare yourself with such silly talk. Mother will\r\nbe with us tomorrow night, and Dad will be back next day. Now go to\r\nsleep.”\r\n\r\nThe elder sister soon dropped into slumber, but the younger lay\r\nopen-eyed, staring into the black room and shuddering at every stifled\r\nscream of the wind or distant growl of thunder. She began to count,\r\nhoping to hypnotize herself into drowsiness, but at every slight noise\r\nshe started, and lost her count.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she turned and shook her sister by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Edith, somebody is prowling around downstairs!” she whispered.\r\n“Listen! Oh, what shall we do?”\r\n\r\nThe elder sister struck a match and lit the candle. Then she slipped on\r\nher dressing-gown, and drew on her slippers.\r\n\r\n“You’re not going down there? Edith, tell me you’re not going\r\ndownstairs! It might be that murdered Berkheim girl! Edith, don’t--”\r\n\r\nEdith shot a glance of withering scorn at her sister, who lay on the\r\nbed with blanched face and wide, terrified eyes.\r\n\r\n“There is something moving around downstairs, and I’m going to find out\r\nwhat it is,” she said.\r\n\r\nTaking the candle, she left the room. Her younger sister lay in the\r\ndarkness, listening to the pattering of rain on the roof and straining\r\nher ears to catch the slightest sound. The noise downstairs ceased, but\r\nthe wind rose and the rain beat upon the roof in sudden furious blasts\r\nthat made her heart jump wildly....\r\n\r\nTen minutes passed--twenty minutes--and Edith had not returned.\r\n\r\nA door slammed, and the younger sister thought she heard something\r\nmoving again, but the wind began to sob and drowned out all other\r\nnoises. Between gusts, she heard the portentous sound, and each time it\r\nseemed nearer.\r\n\r\nThen--she started as she realized that something was coming up the\r\nstairs. Once she thought she heard a cry, to which the wind joined its\r\nplaintive voice in a weird duet.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer the strange noise came. It mounted the stairs, step\r\nby step, heard only when the wind and rain softened their voices. It\r\npassed the first landing, and moved slowly up the second flight, while\r\nthe girl fearfully awaited its coming.\r\n\r\nThe wind howled until the house quaked; it shrilled past the eaves and\r\nfled across the fields like a hunted ghost.\r\n\r\nAnd now the girl’s pounding pulses drowned out the screaming of the\r\nwind, for the presence had _invaded her bedroom_!\r\n\r\nShe cowered under the covers, a cold perspiration chilling her body\r\nuntil her teeth chattered. Her imagination conjured up frightful\r\nthings--a disembodied spirit come to destroy her--a corpse from the\r\ngrave, gibbering in terror because it could not tear the cerements from\r\nits face--the murdered Berkheim girl, with the knife still sheathed\r\nin her heart--or some escaped beast, licking its lips in greedy\r\nanticipation of the feast her tremulous body would provide. Or was it a\r\nmurderer, who, having killed her sister, was now bent on completing his\r\nbloody work?\r\n\r\nA flash of lightning split the sky, and the thunder bellowed its\r\nterrifying warning. The girl threw back the bedclothes and shrank to\r\nthe wall, her eyes starting from their sockets, fearful lest another\r\nflash reveal some sight too ghastly to contemplate.\r\n\r\nSlowly the being dragged itself across the floor, lifted itself onto\r\nthe bed, and uttered a choking sound of agony.\r\n\r\nThe girl sat petrified. Then, timorously, she extended a shaky hand,\r\nbut quickly withdrew it in dread of some hideous contact.\r\n\r\nAgain she thrust her trembling hand into the gloom, farther, farther,\r\nuntil it touched something shaggy and wet.\r\n\r\nA clammy hand closed over hers, and she started to her feet, with a\r\nhorrified scream.\r\n\r\nThe icy hand tightened with a sickening tremor, and dragged her down.\r\nThen her tortured senses gave way, and she fell back unconscious upon\r\nthe bed....\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke, it was day. Beside her, on the bed, lay the bleeding\r\nbody of her sister, Edith, stabbed in the breast by the burglar she had\r\ntried to frighten away.\r\n\r\nThe younger girl was clutching the clotted wisps of hair that had\r\nfallen across the breast of her sister, whose cold hand had closed over\r\nhers in the last convulsive shudder of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Howard Ellis Davis Relates\r\n  Some Extraordinary\r\n  Adventures With_\r\n\r\n                             _The_ UNKNOWN\r\n                                 BEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the little settlement of Bayou le Tor lapped the slack\r\nwaters from which the village had been named. A mile to the south, they\r\nlost themselves in the Mississippi Sound. Northward, they wound among\r\nsomber swamps, to disappear at last into the marshes above.\r\n\r\nGiant cypress trees crowded down to the very edge of the settlement, as\r\nif jealous of the small space of cleared land it occupied beside the\r\nbayou, and to one not accustomed to the place it seemed that an evil\r\nboding lurked forever within the depths of those overhanging, gloomy\r\nswamps.\r\n\r\nBut until the unknown Beast first made its mysterious presence felt, no\r\nharm for the people of Bayou le Tor ever had come out of those swamps,\r\nexcept the deadly malaria, which clutched its victims in shaking agues\r\nand burning fevers that consumed life as a woods fire might consume a\r\nstrip of dried sedge grass.\r\n\r\nBefore this strange death that had come to haunt the night swamps, they\r\nshrank in helpless terror. Cows were driven in from their pastures\r\nwhile the sun was yet high. Mothers called in their sallow-faced\r\nchildren from play as soon as the shadows began to lengthen.\r\n\r\nThe first victim had been Swan Davis, an old fisherman who lived by\r\nhimself on the edge of the bayou above the settlement. He had been\r\nfound in the swamp, dead. At first it was thought that he had been\r\nbeaten to death, he was so broken about the body.\r\n\r\nFinally, however, it was decided he had been crushed by some\r\nmysterious, unknown force. Something had caught him and squeezed him\r\nuntil his bones had cracked like dry reeds.\r\n\r\nThen the three Buntly boys, driving in a bunch of steers from the\r\nmarshes, were overtaken by night on the swamp road. The cattle had been\r\ngoing peacefully enough, when suddenly they had become frightened and\r\nlumbered off ahead, bellowing madly. Themselves frightened at the queer\r\nbehavior of the animals, the boys followed, as fast as they could on\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThat is, two of them did; for when Jard and Peter Buntly emerged from\r\nthe shadows of the swamp road, they found that their brother, Sims, was\r\nnot with them.\r\n\r\nTerror-stricken though they were, they had returned into the swamp,\r\ncalling his name. When they saw nothing of him, and he did not answer\r\ntheir calls, they went quickly home and reported what had happened. All\r\nnight long, bearing flaming torches, the men of the settlement beat up\r\nand down the swamp. Toward morning, they found the young man’s body,\r\nbruised and broken, but no trace of what had killed him.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Bayou le Tor gathered to discuss the circumstances\r\nsurrounding these two mysterious deaths, the negroes, and some others,\r\ndeclared that an evil spirit haunted the gloomy fastness to the north\r\nof the settlement, while the more conservative agreed that some\r\ncreature strange to those parts, some unknown beast, was ranging the\r\nnight swamps, a creature that killed for the love of killing.\r\n\r\nArmed with shotgun and rifle, they hunted him. They set bear-traps,\r\nbaited with an entire quarter of beef hung above. But no one ventured\r\ninto the swamps after dark, until, one night, ten of the best men in\r\nthe settlement formed a party and rode out on horseback through the\r\nswamp road.\r\n\r\nArmed with pistol and sheath-knife, they rode, two by two, knee to\r\nknee, their horses following each other nose to tail, so that if any\r\none of the party were attacked they all could turn and fight in a body.\r\n\r\nNothing happened until they were on their way back; then Walter\r\nBrandon--who, because he was one of their bravest, brought up the\r\nrear--grew careless and lagged behind. Suddenly, his horse came\r\ncharging in among the others, riderless.\r\n\r\nThey could find no trace of Walter, and the other nine could only ride\r\nin and break the news to his young wife, who carried a baby at her\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the girl’s father, old Arner Horn, secured the services\r\nof a small, battered automobile and crossed two counties to see Ed\r\nHardin and beg that he come and deliver them from this unknown beast\r\nthat, one by one, was killing the men-folk of Bayou le Tor.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his own county Ed Hardin was a deputy sheriff, and the reputation of\r\nhis prowess had traveled far. Each summer, when the fishing was best\r\non the Sound, he came to Bayou le Tor. Each winter, he came to hunt\r\nwild turkeys in the swamps that surrounded the settlement. The people\r\nhad grown to know him well, and they knew that he feared neither man,\r\nbeast, nor the devil.\r\n\r\nHe returned in the automobile with Arner, bringing with him his young\r\nfriend, Alex Rowe. When they reached Bayou le Tor, the news awaited\r\nthem that Walter’s body, which bore on it the same marks as those\r\nothers who had been killed, had been found floating on the waters of\r\nthe bayou, and that it was being held at the water’s edge so that Ed\r\nHardin might see for himself the nature of death which this creature\r\ninflicted upon its victims.\r\n\r\nAfter he had seen, Ed Hardin came away alone, grim-mouthed. When he\r\nentered Arner’s yard, it already was growing dark, the night breeze\r\nrustling in the liveoaks overhead. He went to the barn and saddled\r\nArner’s bay mare. Having led her to the front fence, he tied her there\r\nand went into the house.\r\n\r\nIn the hallway, which divided the house through the middle, he paused\r\nas he heard in the room beside him the low sobbing of a woman. Then\r\nhe passed on to the room that had been assigned to him and Alex Rowe.\r\nA small kerosene lamp had been lighted and set upon the dresser,\r\nand in the light of this he was buckling on a belt holding a broad\r\nhunting-knife and a pistol when Alex burst in upon him.\r\n\r\n“Ed Hardin,” cried the young man, “what is that mare doin’ at the front\r\nfence? Where be you goin’?”\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’ ter hunt that beast, Alex.”\r\n\r\n“Yer ain’t goin’ ter do that thing, Ed! Yer don’t know what hit is.\r\nHow--”\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’, Alex.”\r\n\r\n“But, Ed, hit’s _night_. Wait till daylight. The last two times folks\r\nwent out on the swamp road at night they was er man killed.”\r\n\r\nBroad-shouldered, sparely-made, the big deputy drew himself up to his\r\nfull height and turned to gaze for a moment at his young friend.\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’ now,” he said calmly.\r\n\r\n“But, Ed, you heerd what they said ’bout the schooner up in the bayou.\r\nHit’s been layin’ there fer two weeks, ’thout dealin’s with nobody. You\r\nheerd what Rensie Bucker, the ole nigger what uster be er sailor, said.\r\nHe said he paddled up in his dugout by that schooner an’ them folks on\r\nboard is India folks. He says that in their lan’ they’s strange beasts\r\nan’ reptiles, an’ that mebbe they’ve sot one of ’em loose in the swamp,\r\nmebbe put hit ter watch the swamp road.”\r\n\r\n“Ef hit’s been sot ter watch the swamp road at night,” said Ed, “that’s\r\njes wher I want ter go. I want ter meet it.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, Ed. Wait till I git holt of er hoss. I’m goin’ with yer.”\r\n\r\nA soft smile played for a moment about Ed Hardin’s grim mouth.\r\n\r\n“No, Alex,” he said: “I reckon I’ll go by myse’f.”\r\n\r\nAs he was untying the mare, those who had returned to the house\r\ngathered about him and, as Alex had done, tried to prevent his going\r\noff alone into the swamp at night.\r\n\r\nBut he swung lightly to the saddle and galloped out through the\r\nsettlement, into the shadows of the giant cypress trees.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mare was a spirited and nervous animal, and she leaped and shied as\r\nshe danced among the stagnant pools that lay black in the swamp road.\r\n\r\nIn thus going out deliberately to use himself as a bait for the Unknown\r\nBeast, Ed felt that he could depend largely upon her agility and\r\nquickness to prevent being taken unawares by a sudden rush from the\r\ndarkness. He drew from its holster his heavy Colt’s revolver and thrust\r\nit through his belt in front, within convenient reach.\r\n\r\nSo dark was the black tunnel of the road that he could see no space in\r\nfront of him, and he let the reins lie slack on the mare’s neck, so\r\nthat she might be undisturbed in picking her footing. And as he plunged\r\ndeeper into the swamp, he experienced a lonely boding that was new to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTime and again, he had gone fearlessly out alone in the pursuit and\r\ncapture of desperate men. Now, however, he did not know what nature\r\nof creature it was he sought, and he had to invite an attack from the\r\ndarkness in order to get in touch with it.\r\n\r\nThe night was murky, almost sticky in its heaviness, and the swamp\r\nseemed strangely silent. Only the occasional call of some night bird\r\npierced the stillness. He was familiar with the road, having traveled\r\nit frequently, and the places where violence had occurred had been\r\ndescribed to him in detail.\r\n\r\nA few hundred yards to the left of the road, where he now was riding,\r\nthe fisherman had met his death. He passed the place where Brandon last\r\nhad been seen, and, soon after, entered the deeper recess of the swamp\r\nwhere the herder had been snatched into the darkness of death. Plainly,\r\nthis neighborhood of violence was the creature’s lurking-place.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the mare shied, snorted, and stood quivering, her head turned\r\nas though she saw or smelled something at the side of the road. He\r\nraised his pistol, which he now held ready cocked in his hand, and\r\nfired quickly into the darkness. As he had only one hand on the reins,\r\nit was some moments after the report before he could calm the startled\r\nanimal sufficiently to proceed on his way.\r\n\r\nTwice more, at indications of terror from his horse, guided by her\r\nforward-pointed ears, Ed Hardin fired into the black shadows at the\r\nside of the road, the discharges making lurid flashes in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown Beast evidently was near, following him through the\r\nbrush--or over the treetops. If it were on the ground, he hoped for the\r\nslender chance of killing or wounding it before it had an opportunity\r\nto attack.\r\n\r\nAfter each shot, as well as he could for the plunging of the mare,\r\nhe listened intently for some cry of pain, some movement of the\r\nbushes; but the silence of the shadows was unbroken. The strain was\r\nnervewracking, and he had a wild desire to whirl the mare about\r\nand speed away in mad flight. He could not urge her out of a slow,\r\nhesitating walk, and she frequently shied from one side of the road to\r\nthe other, with those periodic halts of trembling fear.\r\n\r\nThen the road ran from beneath the arches of the swamp and passed over\r\na corduroy crossing, bordered on each side by a dense growth of titi.\r\nThe mare went more quietly now, and Ed began to hope that some of his\r\nshots had taken effect. He breathed more freely, now that the branches\r\nno longer drooped overhead.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, he found himself beneath spreading liveoaks. These,\r\nflanking the road on either side, sent their giant limbs horizontally\r\nacross. He peered from side to side, his eyes straining to penetrate\r\nthe gloom, each indistinct tree trunk assuming a sinister outline.\r\n\r\nOverhead, the trees towered in cavernous depths, and suddenly, with a\r\nswish of leaves and branches, out of them dropped a great, dark object!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe frightened mare leaped forward; but the nameless creature alighted\r\nbehind the saddle.\r\n\r\nHardin snatched out his pistol, only to find that he was unable to\r\nuse it. For he had been caught in a giant embrace that pinioned his\r\narms to his sides, an embrace against which his own great strength was\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\nThe mare ran desperately, her supple body close to the ground, her\r\ngraceful neck outstretched. Out from the swamp she sped, crossing a\r\nreach of flat country, once heavily covered with pines. The timber\r\nlong since had been cut, only the stumps remaining, charred by forest\r\nfires--hordes of black ghosts crowding down to the edge of the road on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild ride for the man, with death perched there behind. The\r\ngreat arms, wound about him, were slowly squeezing the breath from his\r\nbody, and beneath that embrace he felt his ribs bend inward to the\r\npoint of cracking. Desperately, he maintained his grip on the saddle\r\nwith his knees.\r\n\r\nThen, just before consciousness would have left him, he raised his legs\r\nand flung himself sideways. The saddle slipped under the mare’s belly.\r\nCarried by the momentum, but with that crushing grip never relaxing,\r\nthe man and the terrible creature which held him hurtled through the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThey struck with a _thud_ against a shattered stump at the side of the\r\nroad, while the frightened mare sped on. The murderous creature was\r\nnext the stump and at the impact its hold on Ed Hardin loosened. Having\r\nslipped from the great arms, Ed flung himself over and rolled for\r\nseveral feet to one side.\r\n\r\nThe pistol long since had dropped from his nerveless fingers; but he\r\nnow quickly drew his hunting-knife. Expecting an immediate attack with\r\nfang and claw, he lay on his back, his feet drawn up, very much in\r\nthe position a cat assumes when defending itself. He knew it would be\r\nuseless to pit his strength against that of the enormous creature, and\r\nthe best he could hope for was to ward off an attack with his feet and\r\nwatch for an opportunity to reach and drive home the knife.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly it was looming there above him. For an instant it seemed\r\nto hesitate, then it backed slowly away. With a quick, halting motion,\r\nwalking upright like a man, it began to circle about him. Its long arms\r\nswung below its knees. A round head was set on a neck so thick and\r\nshort that it seemed to spring from the shoulders themselves. As it\r\ncircled about him, Ed turned also, keeping his feet always presented.\r\n\r\nAgain the creature backed off, up the road. Then it turned and walked\r\nslowly away.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ed Hardin lay watching it, unwilling to change his\r\nposition. Then, tentatively, he raised himself to a sitting position.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as if, without looking, the creature divined his movement, it\r\nturned about, at a distance of perhaps fifty feet.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with a strangely human shriek of rage, it rushed toward him.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs it came through the gloom, this maddened creature, with its uncouth,\r\nhopping run, swinging its long arms from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe man dropped back into his former position, feet raised, arm held\r\nready to strike with the knife.\r\n\r\nBefore it reached him, it dropped forward, without in the least\r\npausing, and, propelled by both arms and legs, shot in a great,\r\nfroglike leap through the air.\r\n\r\nThe shock, as it landed upon him, drove Ed Hardin’s knees back against\r\nhis chest. His right arm, held ready to strike with the knife, was\r\npinned and twisted painfully.\r\n\r\nThe knife slipped from his hand. A long arm shot forward and talon-like\r\nfingers clutched his hair. With his legs doubled back as they were,\r\nonce more he was seized in that giant embrace, and he felt that his\r\nknees were being pressed into his chest until it soon must crush in\r\nlike a shattered eggshell.\r\n\r\nThen consciousness left him.\r\n\r\n... When his senses slowly returned, he became aware of lights flashing\r\nand horses stamping, and the sound of men’s voices.\r\n\r\nJonas Keil was speaking, and Ed had the rare experience of hearing\r\nhimself discussed after he was thought to be dead.\r\n\r\n“--’Most on my bended knees ter git ’im not ter do it. But he said he\r\nwouldn’t feel right ter let Death run loose unhindered, long as he was\r\nlivin’ an’ with strength ter fight. An’ when he rid out single-handed\r\nan’ alone, the bravest man what ever drawed breath was kilt.”\r\n\r\nFrom his position, he judged that he had been placed on the grass at\r\nthe side of the road. Near him was someone who, from an occasional\r\nquivering intake of breath, seemed to have been sobbing.\r\n\r\nHe tried to turn and see who it was, and he found that he could not so\r\nmuch as twitch a finger.\r\n\r\nHe heard three new arrivals come up the road, a man on horseback and\r\ntwo runners, the two evidently holding by the rider’s stirrup leathers.\r\nThe rider, as soon as he drew up, said:\r\n\r\n“We come soon’s we heerd you-all was gone ter foller Ed. Arn’s bringin’\r\nthe waggin. Hit’ll be here terreckly; we passed hit er piece back. But\r\nArn didn’ git the straights from Cy when he come atter the waggin what\r\nhit was kilt Ed. Po’ ole Ed!”\r\n\r\nOld Rensie Bucker, the negro who once had been a sailor, speaking with\r\nthe _patois_ of foreign birth, replied to him:\r\n\r\n“Hit ees Jonas, de chile-minded neegar who was shanghaed from his\r\nmammy’s shack down on de point ten year back. He had de mind of er\r\nchile an’ de strength ob five men, wid his beeg wide shoulders an’\r\nshort neck; wid de hump on his back an’ his arms hangin’ mos’ ter his\r\nankles. He was gentle in dem days; but de East Indee folks tuck heem\r\noff an’ dey brought heem back er beast. He’s frum de schooner, by his\r\nclothes, an’ dey must have sot heem on de swamp road at night ter watch\r\nan’ keel.\r\n\r\n“Dere he lies, dead. De stump ’gin which he struck when he pull Meester\r\nEd Hardin frum his hoss had er sliver which stuck mos’ through heem.\r\nDen when he fit wid Meester Ed de hurt must have killed heem, because\r\nthere is no other wound.”\r\n\r\nThe man beside Ed Hardin spoke, and Ed recognized him.\r\n\r\n“Alex,” he said huskily.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of amazement. Alex called for a light. Someone else,\r\nevidently startled by the voice coming from what all had thought to\r\nbe a dead man, started to run, kicked over a lantern, and was cursed\r\nroundly by the others, who were crowding up.\r\n\r\nWhen the wagon arrived, he was so far recovered that, with the\r\nassistance of the others, he was able to clamber painfully in and sink\r\nto the blankets on the bottom, every joint in his body aching.\r\n\r\nThe two Buntlys had called the younger men to one side and they were\r\nwhispering excitedly together. Presently the riding-horses all were\r\ntied at the side of the road, and when the wagon creaked its way\r\nhomeward, Ed was accompanied only by Alex, who had refused to leave\r\nhim, and by old Arner. Rensie had gone with the others.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, he was able to creep out to the front porch of Arner’s\r\nlittle home and sit in the cool of a breeze that swept up from the\r\nbayou. After a space of silence, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Arn, what’d them fellers do the yuther night? I can’t git er peep\r\nouten ’em.”\r\n\r\n“They foun’ right smart of stuff in boxes, what Rensie said was some\r\nsorter dope, bein’ unloaded from the schooner. But they th’owed hit in\r\nthe water.”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t intrusted in no dope, Arn. I say what’d they do?”\r\n\r\n“The leader of the gang confessed, after he’d been questioned by\r\nRensie, an’ when he saw the jig was up, anyhow. They had sot Jonas ter\r\nkeep folks skeerd off the swamp road at night, by killin’ whosomever\r\ncome there. They was goin’ ter git er truck an’ haul that stuff off\r\nsomewheres.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’d the boys do?”\r\n\r\nReflectively, Arner stroked his short, heavy beard. He spat into the\r\nyard. Then he turned to the deputy:\r\n\r\n“Ed,” he said slowly, “yo’ comin’ down here, an’, single-handed\r\nan’ alone, huntin’ out the critter what was killin’ us off will be\r\nremembered an’ talked about in generations ter come--when these here\r\nswamps is cleared off an’ drained an’ producin’ corn an’ taters. But\r\nsich er little matter as er schooner lyin’ at the bottom of the bayou\r\ngatherin’ barnacles is soon forgot, an’ let’s you an’ me fergit that\r\npart of hit, too.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Basket\r\n\r\n                         _An Odd Little Tale_\r\n\r\n                        _By_ HERBERT J. MANGHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Buhler told him at first that she had no vacancies, but as he\r\nstarted away she thought of the little room in the basement.\r\n\r\nHe turned back at her call.\r\n\r\n“I have got a room, too,” she said, “but it’s a very small one and in\r\nthe basement. I can make you a reasonable price, though, if you’d care\r\nto look at it.”\r\n\r\nThe room was a problem. She always hesitated to show it to people,\r\nbecause so often they seemed insulted at her suggestion that they would\r\nbe satisfied with such humble surroundings. If she gave it to the\r\nfirst applicant, he would likely be a disreputable character who might\r\ndetract from the respectability of her house, and she would have to\r\nface the embarrassment of getting rid of him. So she was content for\r\nweeks at a time to do without the pittance the room brought her.\r\n\r\n“How much is it?” asked the man.\r\n\r\n“Seven dollars a month.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see it.”\r\n\r\nShe called her husband to take her place at the desk, picked up a bunch\r\nof keys and led the way to the rear of the basement. The room was a\r\nnarrow cell, whose one window was slightly below the level of a tiny,\r\nbare back yard, closed in by a board fence.\r\n\r\nA tottering oak dresser was pushed up close to the window, and a small\r\nsquare table, holding a pitcher and washbowl, was standing beside it.\r\nAn iron single-bed against the opposite wall left barely enough space\r\nfor one straight-backed chair and a narrow path from the door to the\r\nwindow. A curtain, hanging across one corner, and a couple of hooks in\r\nthe wall provided a substitute for a closet.\r\n\r\n“You can have the use of the bathroom on the first floor,” said Mrs.\r\nBuhler. “There is no steam heat in the basement, but I will give you\r\nan oil stove to use if you want it. The oil won’t cost you very much.\r\nOf course, it never gets real cold in San Francisco, but when the fogs\r\ncome in off the bay you ought to have something to take the chill off\r\nthe room.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take it.”\r\n\r\nThe man pulled out a small roll of money and counted off seven\r\none-dollar bills.\r\n\r\n“You must be from the East,” remarked Mrs. Buhler, smiling at the paper\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Buhler, looking at his pale hair and eyes and wan mustache, never\r\nthought of asking for references. He seemed as incapable of mischief\r\nas a retired fire horse, munching his grass and dreaming of past\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nHe told her that his name was Dave Scannon.\r\n\r\nAnd that was all the information he ever volunteered to anybody in the\r\nrooming-house.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later he moved in. By carrying in one suitcase and transferring\r\nits contents to the dresser drawers he was installed.\r\n\r\nThe other roomers scarcely noticed his advent. He always walked\r\nstraight across the little lobby without looking directly at anyone,\r\nnever stopping except to pay his rent, which he did promptly on the\r\nfifth of every month.\r\n\r\nHe did not leave his key at the desk when he went out, as was the\r\ncustom of the house, but carried it in his pocket. The chambermaid\r\nnever touched his room. At his request she gave him a broom, and every\r\nSunday morning she left towels, sheets and a pillowcase hanging on his\r\ndoorknob. When she returned, she would find his soiled towels and linen\r\nlying in a neat pile beside his door.\r\n\r\nImpelled by curiosity, Mrs. Buhler once entered the room with her\r\nmaster key. There was not so much as a hair to mar the bare tidiness.\r\nA comb and brush on the dresser and a pile of newspapers were the only\r\nvisible evidences of occupancy. The oil stove was gathering dust in\r\nthe corner: it had never been used. She carried it out with her: it\r\nwould be just the thing for that old lady in the north room who always\r\ncomplained of the cold in the afternoons, when the rest of the hotel\r\nwas not uncomfortable enough to justify turning on the steam.\r\n\r\nThe old lady was sitting in the lobby one afternoon when he came home\r\nfrom work.\r\n\r\n“Is that your basement roomer?” she asked.\r\n\r\nShe watched him until he disappeared at the end of the hall.\r\n\r\n“Oh. I couldn’t think where I’d seen him. But I remember now--he’s a\r\nsort of porter and general helper at that large bakery on lower Market\r\nStreet.”\r\n\r\n“I really didn’t know where he worked,” admitted Mrs. Buhler. “I had\r\nthought of asking him several times, but he’s an awfully hard man to\r\ncarry on a conversation with.”\r\n\r\nHe had been at the rooming-house four months when he received his first\r\nletter. Its envelope proclaimed it a hay-fever cure advertisement.\r\n\r\nAs he was not in the habit of leaving his key at the desk, the letter\r\nremained in his box for three days. Finally Mr. Buhler handed it to him\r\nas he was passing the desk on the way to his room.\r\n\r\nHe paused to read the inscription.\r\n\r\n“You never receive any mail,” remarked Mr. Buhler. “Haven’t you any\r\nfamily?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Where is your home?”\r\n\r\n“Catawissa, Pennsylvania.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a funny name. How do you spell it?”\r\n\r\nScannon spelled it, and went on down the hall.\r\n\r\n“C-a-t-a-w-i-double-s-a,” repeated Mr. Buhler to his wife. “Ain’t that\r\na funny name?”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his room, Scannon removed the advertisement from its envelope and\r\nread it soberly from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nFinished, he folded it and placed it on his pile of newspapers. Then he\r\nbrushed his hair and went out again.\r\n\r\nHe ate supper at one of the little lunch counters near the Civic\r\nCenter. The rest of the evening he spent in the newspaper room at the\r\npublic library. He picked up eastern and western papers with impartial\r\ninterest, reading the whole of each page, religiously and without a\r\nchange of expression, until the closing bell sounded.\r\n\r\nHe never ascended to the reference, circulation or magazine rooms.\r\nSometimes he would take the local papers home with him and read\r\nstretched out on his bed, not seeming to notice that his hands were\r\nblue with the penetrating chill that nightly drifts in from the ocean.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays he would put on a red-striped silk shirt and a blue serge\r\nsuit and take a car to Golden Gate Park. There he would sit for hours\r\nin the sun, impassively watching the hundreds of picnic parties, the\r\nsquirrels, or a piece of paper retreating before the breeze. Or perhaps\r\nhe would walk west to the ocean, stopping for a few minutes at each of\r\nthe animal pens, and take a car home from the Cliff House.\r\n\r\nFor two years the days came and passed on in monotonous reduplication,\r\nthe casual hay-fever cure circulars supplying the only touches of\r\nnovelty.\r\n\r\nThen one afternoon as he was brushing his hair, he gasped and put his\r\nhand to his throat. A sharp nausea pitched him to the floor.\r\n\r\nInch by inch, he dragged himself to the little table and upset it,\r\ncrashing the bowl and pitcher into a dozen pieces.\r\n\r\nHis energy was spent in the effort, and he lay inert.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Buhler consented to accompany her friend to the spiritualist’s\r\nonly after repeated urging, and she repented her decision as soon as\r\nshe arrived there.\r\n\r\nThe fusty parlor was a north room to which the sun never penetrated,\r\nand in consequence was cold and damp. The medium, a fat, untidy woman\r\nwhose movements were murmurous with the rustle of silk and the tinkle\r\nof tawdry ornaments, sat facing her with one hand pressed to forehead,\r\nand delivered mysteriously-acquired information about relatives and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n“Who is Dave?” she asked finally.\r\n\r\nMrs. Buhler hastily recalled all of her husband’s and her own living\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know any Dave,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, you know him,” insisted the medium. “He’s in the spirit land\r\nnow. There’s death right at your very door!”\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her throat and coughed in gruesome simulation of\r\ninternal strangulation.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know any Dave,” reiterated Mrs. Buhler.\r\n\r\nShe regained the street with a feeling of vast relief.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never go to one of those places again!” she asserted, as she said\r\ngood-by to her friend. “It’s too creepy!”\r\n\r\nA great fog bank was rolling in majestically from the west, blotting\r\nout the sun and dripping a fine drizzle on the pavements. Drawing\r\nher coat collar closer about her neck, Mrs. Buhler plunged into the\r\nenveloping dampness and started to climb the long hill that led to her\r\nrooming-house.\r\n\r\nHer husband’s distended eyes and pale face warned her of bad news.\r\n\r\n“Dave Scannon’s dead!” he whispered hoarsely.\r\n\r\n_Dave Scannon!_ So that was “Dave!”\r\n\r\n“He’s been dead two or three days,” continued Mr. Buhler. “I was\r\nbeating a rug in the back yard a while ago when I noticed a swarm of\r\nbig blue flies buzzing about his window. It flashed over me right\r\naway that I hadn’t seen him for several days. I couldn’t unlock his\r\ndoor, because his key was on the inside, so I called the coroner and\r\na policeman, and we broke it in. He was lying between the bed and the\r\ndresser, and the bowl and pitcher lay broken on the floor, where he had\r\nknocked it over when he fell. They’re taking him out now.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Buhler hurried to the back stairway and descended to the lower\r\nhall. Two men were carrying a long wicker basket up the little flight\r\nof steps between the back entrance and the yard. She remained straining\r\nover the banister until the basket had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe coroner had found nothing in his room but clothing, about five\r\ndollars in change, and a faded picture in a tarnished silver frame of\r\nan anemic looking woman who might have been a mother, wife or sister.\r\n\r\nMrs. Buhler answered his questions nervously. Yes, the dead man had\r\nbeen with them about two years. They knew little of him, for he was\r\nvery peculiar and never talked, and wouldn’t even allow the maid to\r\ncome in and clean up his room. He had said though that he had no family\r\nand that his home was in Catawissa, Pennsylvania. She remembered the\r\ntown because it had such an odd name.\r\n\r\nThe coroner wrote to authorities in Catawissa, who replied that they\r\ncould find no traces of anyone by the name of Scannon. No more mail\r\never came for the man except the occasional hay-fever cure circulars.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the bakery telephoned to ask if the death notice in the\r\npaper referred to the same Dave Scannon who had been working for him.\r\nHe knew nothing of the man except that he had been very punctual in his\r\nduties until that final day when he did not appear.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks later, little Mrs. Varnes, who occupied a room at the\r\nrear of the second floor, stopped at the desk to leave her key. She\r\nhovered there for a few minutes of indecision, then impulsively leaned\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Buhler, I just want to ask you something,” she said, lowering her\r\nvoice. “One afternoon several weeks ago I saw some men carrying a long\r\nbasket out of the back door, and I’ve been wondering what it was.”\r\n\r\n“Probably laundry,” hazarded Mrs. Buhler.\r\n\r\n“No, it was one of those long baskets such as the undertakers use to\r\ncarry the dead in. I’ve often thought about it, but I couldn’t figure\r\nout who could have died in this house, so I decided I would ask you. I\r\ntold my husband about it, and he said I was dreaming.”\r\n\r\n“You must have been,” said Mrs. Buhler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _The_\r\n                            ACCUSING VOICE\r\n                           _A Strange Tale_\r\n\r\n                          _By_ MEREDITH DAVIS\r\n\r\n\r\n“We, the jury, find the defendant, Richard Bland, guilty of murder in\r\nthe first degree, in manner and form as charged.”\r\n\r\nAllen Defoe, foreman of the twelve men, listened with impassive face\r\nas the judge read away the life of the prisoner in the dock--the man\r\nwhose death warrant Defoe had signed only a few minutes before. As the\r\njudge finished, Defoe glanced warily toward the prisoner. Somehow, he\r\npreferred to avoid catching his eye.\r\n\r\nBland, a slight, rather uninteresting type of man, stood with bowed\r\nhead; Defoe now turned his gaze full upon him.\r\n\r\n“Has the prisoner anything to say why judgment should not be\r\npronounced?”\r\n\r\nThe judge’s voice, coming after the short pause, sent a strange chill\r\ninto the heart of Allen Defoe, juror. He hoped the prisoner’s counsel\r\nwould make the customary motions for a new trial or for time in which\r\nto file an appeal. He did neither: evidently Bland believed the verdict\r\ninescapable--or else he was out of funds.\r\n\r\nNow the judge arose in his place, donning with nervous gesture the\r\nblack cap that accompanies the most tragic moment in the performance\r\nof a court’s duties. The judge seemed ill at ease in the cap. It was\r\nthe first time he had worn it. The grotesque thought flitted through\r\nDefoe’s mind that perhaps the judge had borrowed the cap from one of\r\nhis fellow jurists for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe almost level rays of the western sun diffused a sombre, aureate\r\nglow athwart the judge’s bench, so that the dark figure of the standing\r\nman was in mystic indistinctness beyond the shaft of light from the\r\nwindow. A fly now and then craved the spotlight for a moment and lazily\r\nfloated from the growing dusk of the room to the avenue of ebbing day,\r\nstreaming in from the west. And always there was a constant turmoil of\r\ndust particles, visible only when they moved into the bright relief of\r\nthe sun-shaft.\r\n\r\nThe handful of spectators stirred restlessly while the judge was making\r\nhis preparations. The droning noises of approaching summer evening in\r\na rural county-seat were smothered by the buzz of ill-hushed voices.\r\nPerhaps that was why the judge, in the midst of adjusting his headgear,\r\nrapped sharply thrice with his gavel--or, it may have been only his\r\nexcess of nervousness.\r\n\r\nDefoe thought the judge never would stop fumbling with his cap. And\r\nfinally the judge lost track of the jury’s verdict and had to mess\r\nthrough the scattered papers before him until he found it. He didn’t\r\nreally require it to pronounce sentence of death upon the man in the\r\ndock. Hunting it, though, delayed the inevitable a few seconds;\r\nand Defoe wondered, since he himself was near to screaming out with\r\nimpatience, how the prisoner could stand it without going suddenly mad.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, read the death sentence!” exclaimed Defoe under his\r\nbreath, but loud enough to arouse a nod of approval from the two jurors\r\nnearest him.\r\n\r\nA moment later the judge found his voice:\r\n\r\n“The prisoner will face the court.”\r\n\r\nSlowly, deliberately, the prisoner stepped forward in the dock, leaning\r\nslightly against the railing and letting one hand rest upon it. He\r\nlooked squarely at the judge now, although he barely could distinguish\r\nhis features in the dimness.\r\n\r\nAgain the judge spoke, and this time his voice was hurried and strained:\r\n\r\n“The sentence of the court is that the prisoner be taken, between\r\nthe hours of seven a.m. and six p.m. on Tuesday, in the week\r\nbeginning October 22 next, from the place of confinement to the\r\nplace of execution, and there be hanged by the neck until he is\r\ndead--dead--dead!... And may God, in His infinite wisdom, have mercy on\r\nyour soul!”\r\n\r\nThe judge sank back heavily into the safety of his chair. His hand\r\nswept up to brush his forehead and with the same motion it whisked off\r\nthe detestable little black cap.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner remained staring at the judge as one who is puzzled at a\r\nstrange sight. Perhaps he would have stood there untold minutes if a\r\nwoman’s hysterical laugh, half-choked by a sudden upraised hand, had\r\nnot broken the tension of the entire room. A bailiff tiptoed to the\r\nwoman, and, as if revived to duty by the same cause, a prison guard\r\nstrode forward to lead the condemned man away.\r\n\r\nDefoe could have reached out and touched Bland as he passed the jury\r\non his way to the cell across the street. But Defoe had no desire even\r\nto look at Bland; indeed, he did not, until Bland’s back was passing\r\nout of sight through the door on the other side of the jury box.\r\nMechanically, then, Defoe filed out with the other jurors as the judge\r\nannounced adjournment.\r\n\r\nAnd the black cap lay forgotten on the rim of the judge’s wastebasket,\r\nwhere the janitor found it that evening and crossed himself fervently\r\nas he timidly salvaged it from ignoble oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\nDefoe awoke with a shudder.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment or two, as is always the case when one arouses from\r\nheavy, dream-burdened slumber, during which Defoe could not tell where\r\nhis dream ended and realities began. He blinked experimentally into the\r\nsmouldering fire in the open grate before him; yes, he was conscious.\r\nFor further verification of this he drew forth his watch and noted\r\nthe hour. The glow from the fire was scarcely sufficient for reading\r\nthe dial and Defoe leaned forward the better to see. He was still too\r\ndrowsy even to reach around and turn on the electric lamp on the table\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nStill he was not certain whether he was yet dreaming, until--\r\n\r\n“Don’t budge, Defoe! I’ve got you covered!”\r\n\r\nThe Voice was close to his left ear. Its commanding acerbity quelled\r\nDefoe’s impulse to spring to his feet; and as he gripped the arms of\r\nthe chair tensely he managed to challenge his unseen intruder:\r\n\r\n“Who are you? What do you want here?”\r\n\r\nThe Voice moved a little upward and back before it answered:\r\n\r\n“You’ve just had a nasty dream, Defoe. Perhaps I--”\r\n\r\n“How do you know I did!” interrupted Defoe.\r\n\r\n“You did, though, didn’t you?” the Voice insisted.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but how did you know?” repeated Defoe.\r\n\r\n“Never mind how,” said the Voice. “I’ll wager you’ve had the same dream\r\npretty often in the last dozen years, too. It must be hell to have a\r\nscene like that forever before your mind, so that you’re always in\r\ndread of dreaming about it--”\r\n\r\n“What scene?” demanded Defoe. “Are you a mind reader--a wizard--_what_\r\nare you?”\r\n\r\nThe Voice chuckled.\r\n\r\n“None of those,” it said. “As I was saying, you must be afraid, almost,\r\nto go to bed at night. _I_ would be, if I thought I might dream of\r\nsending an innocent man to the gallows--”\r\n\r\n“Stop!” Defoe fairly shouted. “Damn it all, come around here where\r\nI can see you!” and he made an instinctive move to turn about and\r\nconfront his tormentor.\r\n\r\nThe firm pressure of an automatic barrel against his temple halted him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t make the mistake of turning around!” again warned the Voice\r\nincisively.\r\n\r\nThen, in a lighter tone, it went on:\r\n\r\n“If I were in your place, Mr. Defoe, do you know what I’d do?”\r\n\r\nA pause. Defoe mumbled a faint “No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I either would confess my whole knowledge of the affair--or--I’d\r\ncommit suicide!”\r\n\r\nDefoe started. It was uncanny, eerie, the way this mysterious Voice put\r\ninto words the one gnawing thought that had plagued him the last dozen\r\nyears of his life.\r\n\r\n“Of course, you probably have contemplated those alternatives very\r\noften,” the Voice continued. “But have you ever considered doing both?\r\nThat is, did you ever think that you might confess first, thereby\r\nclearing an innocent man’s name of murder, and then cheat the law\r\nyourself by committing sui--”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, stop that infernal suicide talk!” Defoe snapped. “In\r\nthe first place, I don’t know what ‘affair’ or what ‘innocent man’\r\nyou’re talking about.”\r\n\r\nThe Voice chuckled again. Defoe was beginning to hate that chuckle more\r\nthan the feel of the automatic against his head. If the Voice kept on\r\nchuckling it might drive him to desperation to grapple with his armed\r\ninquisitor, even though he would court certain death in doing it.\r\n\r\n“Why, there’s no need to explain the obvious,” the Voice replied, its\r\nchuckle rippling through the words. “Your dream ought to tell you that.\r\nSpeaking of your dream again, Mr. Defoe, reminds me of a question I\r\noften wished to ask you: Did you see Bland at all after his conviction?”\r\n\r\n“No, of course--” Defoe’s guard had been down. He was fairly tricked,\r\nso he tried to run to cover again. “What--who is this Bland you’re\r\ntalking about?”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, Mr. Defoe,” said the Voice. “Think over your dream a\r\nmoment. Surely you remember the man in the prisoner’s dock--the man who\r\ntook his sentence with head up, facing the judge like a Spartan! Surely\r\nyou remember Richard Bland. But did you happen to see him again after\r\nthat day?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Defoe said. “Why should I have seen him after my connection with\r\nhis case ended?”\r\n\r\n“But didn’t you even write him a note expressing your regret at having\r\nhad to perform the duty of--”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!” interrupted Defoe. “Who ever heard of a foreman of a\r\njury doing such a thing? Besides, he deserved his punishment.”\r\n\r\nThe Voice was silent a moment or two before it replied:\r\n\r\n“We’ll discuss the merits of the case later.... And you didn’t even go\r\nto see him hanged?”\r\n\r\n“What manner of man do you think I am?” exclaimed Defoe. “Of course I\r\ndidn’t! I wasn’t even in Chicago where he was hanged.”\r\n\r\n“No?” said the Voice. “Where were you?”\r\n\r\n“A few weeks after the trial I had to go to Europe on a long business\r\ntrip. I was gone a year or so. When I returned to this country I made\r\nmy home here in New York City.”\r\n\r\n“So you never even read in the newspapers about Bland--” the Voice\r\npersisted. “I don’t suppose the European papers would bother with a\r\npiece of American news like that, though.”\r\n\r\n“No. I never read anything about the case after I left this country,”\r\nsaid Defoe.\r\n\r\n“That’s odd. I’d have thought you would have followed the case through\r\nto the end,” the Voice said, half-musingly. “But still, if you had,\r\nperhaps you would not be here tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? What difference would it have made?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. That’s merely my surmise,” said the Voice.\r\n\r\nA faint footstep padded through the hall outside the living-room.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Manuel?” Defoe asked, wondering what would happen when\r\nhis Cuban valet encountered the intruder behind the chair.\r\n\r\nThe footstep halted.\r\n\r\n“Si, _senor_,” answered the man-servant, at a respectful distance from\r\nhis master’s chair. “I come to see why you sit up so late, _senor_.”\r\n\r\nDefoe laughed mirthlessly. “Well, truth to tell, Manuel, I am detained\r\non business,” and he wondered again how Manuel had escaped noticing the\r\nother presence in the room.\r\n\r\n“You mean you fell asleep, _senor_?” asked the valet.\r\n\r\n“I did, but some friendly caller has kept me pretty well awake the last\r\nten minutes.”\r\n\r\n“But he has gone? And you come to bed now?” inquired the Cuban.\r\n\r\nDefoe, after a pause, said, “Yes; I might as well go to bed, I guess.”\r\n\r\nThe Voice behind the chair broke in:\r\n\r\n“Tell your valet you will smoke another cigar before you retire.”\r\n\r\nDefoe settled down again in the chair.\r\n\r\n“You heard, Manuel?” he asked. “You see, my visitor says he wishes me\r\nto smoke another cigar.”\r\n\r\n“But I see no visitor, _senor_,” said the Cuban.\r\n\r\n“You heard what he said, though,” Defoe insisted.\r\n\r\n“No, _senor_. I only hear _you_ say he wish you to smoke another\r\ncigar,” explained the valet.\r\n\r\n“Well, you ought to have your ears examined, Manuel. Get my box from\r\nthe table and hand it to my visitor.”\r\n\r\nManuel fumbled in the darkness until he found the box, then handed it\r\nto Defoe. The latter waved it toward the Voice behind him.\r\n\r\n“My guest first, Manuel,” he corrected.\r\n\r\nThe Cuban stood motionless. “I see no one else,” he insisted.\r\n\r\nThe Voice interrupted:\r\n\r\n“Tell him I don’t care to smoke, Mr. Defoe.”\r\n\r\n“I can see no one, _senor_,” the Cuban repeated.\r\n\r\n“But didn’t you just _hear_ him?” Defoe cried, leaning forward\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n“No, _senor_, I hear no one speak but you.”\r\n\r\nDefoe stared up at his valet, then half rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Defoe!” commanded the Voice sharply.\r\n\r\nDefoe sank back once more.\r\n\r\n“There!” he exclaimed to his valet. “Now tell me you didn’t hear any\r\none order me to sit down just then!”\r\n\r\nThe Cuban shook his head. “No, _senor_, I hear no one talk but you\r\nsince I come in.”\r\n\r\nHis master swore helplessly. “Are you trying to make a fool of me,\r\nManuel? Do you dare stand there and tell me no one spoke to me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, _senor_. I only know I hear no one speak--”\r\n\r\nAgain the Voice intruded:\r\n\r\n“It may be that Manuel thinks you are trying to make a fool of him,” it\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n“Do you?” Defoe asked the Cuban.\r\n\r\n“Do I what, _senor_?” the valet asked, placidly.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I’m trying to make a fool of you?”\r\n\r\n“I do not say so, do I, _senor_?” the servant replied, deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n“No, but you heard--or _did_ you hear?--this visitor say it!”\r\n\r\nThe Cuban, almost tearfully, denied it, becoming verbose in his\r\nprotestation.\r\n\r\nDefoe flapped his arms on the wings of his easy chair and bade his\r\nvalet hush.\r\n\r\n“Get out of here, you brown-skinned dumbbell! One of us has gone crazy\r\ntonight!”\r\n\r\nThe Cuban moved off, keeping a suspicious eye upon his master. His\r\nretreating footstep presently was heard dying away in the hall outside.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think of that damned little Cuban?” Defoe asked the\r\nVoice. “I wonder what made him lie so brazenly?”\r\n\r\nThere was no response. Defoe repeated his second question.\r\n\r\nStill silence answered him.\r\n\r\n“Have you gone, my friend?” Defoe asked, turning part way in his chair\r\nto test the other’s watchfulness. This time no automatic punched his\r\nhead and no command wilted him into the depths of his chair again.\r\n\r\nStill doubtful of his good luck, Defoe called out once more:\r\n\r\n“I say, stranger, have you gone?”\r\n\r\nThe only sound that greeted his ears was the faint creaking of a window\r\nin the adjoining dining-room. Defoe rose and darted to the connecting\r\ndoor, snapping on the electric light at the entrance to the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe room was vacant of any soul but himself.\r\n\r\nAll he could see was the slight movement of the lace curtain at the\r\ndining-room window--and when he examined the window he found it latched.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _III._\r\n\r\nThe next day Defoe went to his doctor. He wished to take stock of\r\nhimself; perhaps he had been applying himself too closely to his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“You are badly run down, Allen,” the physician said, almost before he\r\nhad sat down with his patient. “You look mentally distressed.”\r\n\r\n“I am,” admitted Defoe. “Working too hard, I guess.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor eyed him keenly.\r\n\r\n“Anything else troubling you?” he asked.\r\n\r\nDefoe insisted there really was nothing at all beside his work that was\r\naffecting him. So the doctor gave the usual diagnosis: Too much nerve\r\ntension, not enough sleep, not the proper kinds of food. He ended by\r\nadvising more rest and quiet.\r\n\r\n“And avoid excitement, too,” he warned. “That old heart palpitation\r\nmight crop up again, you know.”\r\n\r\nIt was all very well for the doctor to advise more rest and more sleep,\r\nbut how was a man to sleep beneath a Damocles sword of mystery, of\r\nweird forebodings?\r\n\r\nIt was three weeks before Defoe felt that he was succeeding in obeying\r\nthe doctor’s instructions, partly, at least. Then--.\r\n\r\nIt happened late one night. Defoe lay in bed, his back to the lighted\r\nelectric lamp on the table: he had fallen asleep, reading. Suddenly he\r\nstirred at a touch on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“That you, Manuel?” he asked, drowsily. “All right, put out the li--”\r\n\r\n“No, it is not Manuel--and don’t bother to turn around, Defoe!” this\r\nlast sharply, as Defoe made a movement to arise in bed.\r\n\r\n“You again!” Defoe exclaimed. “What--how did you get in?”\r\n\r\n“That’s my problem, not yours,” said the Voice. “I merely dropped in\r\nagain to inquire if you had thought any more of doing what I suggested.”\r\n\r\nDefoe checked an insane desire to leap out of bed and make a break\r\nfor the door--anything, to escape this tormentor at his back! But he\r\nremembered the automatic....\r\n\r\nHe got himself under a semblance of control before he answered:\r\n\r\n“Your suggestions were ridiculous. Why should I have anything to\r\nconfess about the Bland trial, or why should I commit suicide over it?”\r\nHe even essayed a laugh meant to be derisive.\r\n\r\nBut the intruder chose to ignore Defoe’s evasions. His next remark was\r\nas startling as it was illuminating:\r\n\r\n“Did you know,” said the Voice, “that of the other eleven jurors who\r\nconvicted Bland, only seven are living--still?”\r\n\r\n“No; I haven’t kept track of the other eleven men,” replied Defoe,\r\nannoyed subconsciously by the detachment that the Voice gave to the\r\nword “still.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have,” said the Voice. “Two of the surviving seven are in\r\ninsane asylums; two of the four dead committed sui--.”\r\n\r\nDefoe could brook it no longer. He wrenched around in bed to grapple\r\nwith his antagonist, forgetful, in his madness, of the automatic. But\r\nbefore he could free himself from the bedclothes the lamp was snapped\r\nout, and Defoe was left ignominiously tumbled in the darkness on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nA chuckle from the vicinity of the bedroom door told him of his guest’s\r\ndeparture....\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, after the nerve-racking night, Defoe found it hard\r\nto realize that his two experiences with the Voice really had taken\r\nplace. None the less, he knew they were preying on his vitality, on his\r\nbrain-functions.\r\n\r\nRepeatedly the thought came to him that it was all a dream like his\r\nrecollection of the murder trial out of which he had awakened the night\r\nof the Voice’s first visit. But always against the theory of the dream\r\nhe placed his remembrance of the feel of the automatic revolver; and,\r\ntoo, the fact that he had talked with Manuel and with the Voice at the\r\nsame time argued against the dream explanation.\r\n\r\nLeft, then, was conscience--that is, if the visits of the Voice were\r\nsimply hallucinations of a distracted mind. But why should conscience\r\nwait for twelve years to haunt and harass him?\r\n\r\nThe more he pondered it all, the greater became the dread of another\r\nvisit from the Voice. The greater grew his fear, too, of losing his\r\nreason, as he sought to analyze the situation from every conceivable\r\nstandpoint. With every new bit of theorizing, Defoe felt himself giving\r\nway more and more to melancholia such as he knew is frequently but\r\nthe prelude to insanity. Was it possible, he wondered, for a man’s\r\nconscience to drive him to imbecility?\r\n\r\nDefoe finally accepted the inevitable.\r\n\r\n“Manuel,” he ordered, the second morning after the bedroom encounter\r\nwith the Voice, “pack my things. We’re going away.”\r\n\r\n“Away, _senor_? Where?”\r\n\r\nDefoe’s brain groped vainly for an instant, then seized upon the only\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n“The sea--a sea voyage. My nerves....”\r\n\r\nManuel busied himself among Defoe’s clothes. “Do you need many things,\r\n_senor_? Do you go far away--Europe, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“No, no. Just down the coast--Old Point Comfort, I guess. Yes, that’s\r\nit. A week or so of rest. Just my steamer trunk and a suitcase will do.”\r\n\r\nThe day of the trip down the coast was as perfect as he could have\r\nwanted for his own satisfaction. All during the forenoon the Old\r\nDominion steamer skirted the Jersey shore line, and Defoe sat out on\r\ndeck basking in the sun and already feeling better for the salt-laden\r\nair that he breathed in deeply. In the afternoon he napped most of the\r\ntime and when nightfall chilled the deck promenaders he descended with\r\nthe rest to the dining-saloon.\r\n\r\nIt was while sitting in the smoking-saloon, after dinner, that Defoe\r\nfirst had the impression that he was being watched. A poker game was\r\ngoing on, lackadaisically, in one corner of the saloon; scattered in\r\nchairs and cushioned seats along the windows were perhaps a dozen or\r\nfifteen men. But, for the life of him, Defoe could not pick out any\r\none in the room who might be watching him, now he gave his fleeting\r\nimpression indulgence long enough to look about him.\r\n\r\nFinishing a cigar, Defoe decided on a deck stroll before retiring. It\r\nwas too cold and damp, with a fog beginning to gather, to permit of\r\nsitting on deck, so he paced to and fro briskly up near the fore deck\r\nbeneath the pilot’s tower. The nervousness of the few moments in the\r\nsmoking-saloon, when he imagined himself being watched, transmuted\r\nitself into a shiver as the foggy dampness penetrated to his marrow.\r\nHe lit a fresh cigar and puffed at it jerkily as if to generate bodily\r\nwarmth. Presently the shiver developed into a veritable shudder such as\r\nprecedes chills or certain forms of ague.\r\n\r\nDefoe, thoroughly miserable and alarmed now at the fear of sickness on\r\nboard ship, chafed his cheeks with his hands and, on his way to the\r\nentrance to the stateroom, he flailed his arms about himself to stem\r\nthe onrush of the chill. Once inside the passageway of the staterooms,\r\nhowever, he felt warmer, and by the time he reached his stateroom door\r\nthe chill had subsided almost completely.\r\n\r\nHe was still uncomfortably cold, though, as he opened the door. With\r\none hand he unbuttoned his overcoat and with the other he reached\r\ngropingly for the electric light button on the wall. He fumbled around\r\nfor it a few seconds, then swore softly in vexation because he had not\r\nnoticed by daylight just where it was located.\r\n\r\nGroping with both hands, now, he stumbled around the\r\nnone-too-commodious room, feeling for the push button on the wall. He\r\npaused once and took inventory of his pockets and cursed his luck for\r\nlack of another match.\r\n\r\nThen he went to hunting in the dark again--until his hand came full\r\nagainst a living body....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IV._\r\n\r\nThe body stirred, eluding Defoe’s contact.\r\n\r\nDefoe fell to quaking once more, but it was not the trembling of the\r\nchill this time. He opened his mouth to challenge the intruder, and all\r\nhe could do was swallow and gag at the words that stuck in his throat.\r\n\r\nA pressure against the pit of his stomach--a firm shove of hand upon\r\nhis shoulder--and Defoe found himself stepping backward until it seemed\r\nhe must have walked the length of the ship. But of course he hadn’t--he\r\nhadn’t even left the stateroom--and suddenly he was tumbled on to the\r\nedge of the berth, the pressure against his abdomen increasing.\r\n\r\nA vague nausea gripped him. He clutched at his abdomen and his\r\nfingers wrapped themselves around the barrel of an automatic pistol.\r\nThe pressure against his body became unbearable, piercing.... Defoe\r\ncrumpled back into the berth and the convulsive effort restored his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n“What the hell are you doing?” he exploded. “Get out of here! What are\r\nyou trying to do--stab me with a pistol?”\r\n\r\nThe incongruity of his question aroused a titter of amusement from the\r\ninvisible presence.\r\n\r\n“No, I only wished to make sure you weren’t trying to get away.”\r\n\r\nThat Voice again!--_here_! Defoe cringed in a sort of abject fear.\r\n\r\n“What are you--_who are you_?” Defoe struggled to keep his voice\r\nsteady, struggled, indeed, to keep his reason from flying out of\r\nbalance and shattering into a thousand pieces of driveling idiocy.\r\n\r\n“Call me anything you care to,” replied the Voice in the dark.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe you are--_anything_ at all! I think you are all a\r\ndream, a nightmare, a damnable hallucination that I can’t get rid of!\r\nTo hell with you! I’m going to go down to the smoking-room and--smoke\r\nyou out of my mind! I’m going to stay in the light from now on, day and\r\nnight, until I get over this morbid dreaming!”\r\n\r\nDefoe really thought he meant it all, until the pressure against his\r\nstomach made him doubt his courage and defiance.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the nausea--maybe seasickness; he never had thought of\r\nthat!--that was griping at his vitals like the insistent pressure of a\r\nsteel-barreled weapon.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Mr. Defoe!” commanded the Voice. “I’ve got something to say\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“To hell with you!” Defoe repeated, almost hysterically now. His hands\r\nclutched at the pressure again--and once more the pistol barrel sent\r\nhim squirming back into the recesses of the berth.\r\n\r\n“I want to talk to you some more about the Bland case,” went on the\r\nVoice, unperturbed by the other’s outburst. “When are you going to\r\nconfess?”\r\n\r\n“Confess?” Defoe parried. “Confess what?”\r\n\r\n“Confess that you knew Bland was innocent when you convicted him,” said\r\nthe Voice.\r\n\r\n“But I didn’t.” It was like wrestling with one’s conscience, Defoe\r\nthought, this interminable denying of Bland’s innocence. He was\r\nwearying of it all; his mind was revolting at the repeated “third\r\ndegree” of this mysterious Voice. Soon, he feared, his brain would\r\nrefuse to function.\r\n\r\n“But you’ve said you did,” the Voice insisted.\r\n\r\n“When? It’s a lie!” exclaimed Defoe.\r\n\r\nThe Voice chuckled, sending a shudder through the man crouching in the\r\ncorner of the berth.\r\n\r\n“You probably don’t know, Mr. Defoe, that for a number of years you\r\nhave had the treacherous habit of talking in your sleep--talking\r\nvolubly, excitedly, sometimes almost reconstructing entire incidents in\r\nyour talk for the benefit of anyone who might happen to be listening.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Defoe.\r\n\r\n“Simply this: Manuel has overheard enough to--”\r\n\r\n“Manuel?” broke in Defoe. “What’s he got to do with it!”\r\n\r\n“I forgot to tell you,” the Voice apologized. “The Cuban is my\r\nconfederate--former member of the Secret Police of Havana, you know.\r\nI saved his life during the Spanish war and--well, he’s paying back\r\nan old debt, as he calls it. He let me in and out of your house, and\r\ntipped me off about this trip. You see, Manuel had overheard you say,\r\nin your sleep, that you convicted an innocent man of murder. So I knew\r\nyour conscience--”\r\n\r\n“Are you trying to be my conscience? Are you trying to plague me into\r\nconfessing? Are you--”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the Voice, “unless you choose to call me your\r\nconscience. I’m willing. You seem to be in need of one. Do you know,\r\nMr. Defoe,” and the Voice took on a more affable tone, “you have been\r\nfearfully distracted the last few weeks or months. You need a rest--a\r\n_long_ rest!”\r\n\r\nDefoe was silent, hunched in the retreat of the berth. He had no\r\nfight left in him. Presently he fell to whimpering quietly, as a\r\nchild does when it is punished beyond endurance and is too frightened\r\nto cry. The Voice, it seemed, missed the old combativeness, gone so\r\nquickly after Defoe’s late outburst, so it prodded the hunted man\r\nwith its chief weapon--not its pistol, but its chuckle. This time it\r\nchuckled devilishly, aggravatingly, and it rasped against the tender\r\nsensibilities of the sniveling Defoe like salt in an open wound.\r\n\r\nThen something broke what little bonds of restraint remained in Defoe.\r\nHe sprang, catlike, to the outer edge of the berth and lunged for\r\nthe arm that held the pistol. In the darkness his head struck the\r\ncross-support of the berth above and he slumped forward, half dazed by\r\nthe blow.\r\n\r\nAgain the chuckle sounded in his ears, now ringing with the stunning\r\nimpact; and again Defoe lurched forward, only to fall dizzily to the\r\nfloor. He clambered clumsily to his feet, gripping the berth for a\r\nmomentary prop.\r\n\r\nSoon his head began to clear. He was assembling out of the maze of ache\r\nand buzzing in his ears and brain some sort of coherent idea of where\r\nhe was and what had been happening.\r\n\r\n“Now I know what it all means!” he burst forth presently. “You--you\r\nsneaking, cackling little conscience, get out of here! I’m going to\r\ncheat you if I have to become a drunkard or a dope fiend the rest of my\r\nlife! I’m not going to let a conscience, or a voice or a chuckle, drive\r\nme to insanity--or to confessing--or to suicide!”\r\n\r\nDefoe was steady enough now, supporting himself against the upper\r\nberth. His voice grew more strident.\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not going to let my conscience get the best of me! You thought\r\nyou could keep after me endlessly, but I’ll get rid of you. I’m never\r\ngoing to be bothered with you or your voice again! Never! Now get out\r\nof here! Get out of here, I say!”\r\n\r\nThe chuckle--a croaking, sepulchral chuckle it was now--answered him\r\nout of the darkness.\r\n\r\n“You might tell me, before I go, if you know who really did kill the\r\nman Bland was convicted of murdering,” said the Voice. “I’m curious\r\nenough to wish to know his name.” And the Voice chuckled once more.\r\n\r\n“Damn that cackle! I’ll tell you, if you choke off that infernal\r\ncackling! I’ll tell you--_yes_! _I_ can tell you, because _I did it_!\r\n_I_ committed that murder, you understand? _I_ did it! Now cackle\r\nall you want to! And I convicted Bland of it! Cackle, you damned\r\nlittle shriveled conscience! _Ho, ho, ho-ho-ho!_ I think it’s my\r\nturn--to--cackle--now!”\r\n\r\nThe words of the hysterical man rose to a maudlin scream that\r\nreverberated piercingly in the little stateroom.\r\n\r\n“Now get out of here for good!” the raving Defoe shouted, recovering\r\ncoherence of speech after a time. “Get out--before--I--”\r\n\r\nA blinding glare of light came as Defoe reached for the door. The\r\nintruder had found the push button.\r\n\r\nDefoe stared--then toppled to the floor.\r\n\r\n“Bland! _Bland! You! It’s you...._”\r\n\r\nAnd before the stranger that was Bland passed from the room he felt\r\nagain of the heart of the craven hulk at his feet. The doctor had been\r\nright: The tumult in the breast of the twelfth juror had been too much.\r\n\r\nIf only Defoe had known that the Governor had pardoned Bland, his\r\nsecret might have been safe forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Walter Scott Story offers\r\n  a new conclusion to\r\n  Edgar Allen Poe’s\r\n “Cask of Amontillado”_\r\n\r\n                             _The_ Sequel\r\n\r\n\r\nSobered on the instant--the padlock had clicked when Montresor passed\r\nthe chain about my waist and thus fastened me to the wall--I stood\r\nupright in the little dungeon, the blood running cold in my veins.\r\n\r\nWith maniacal laughter, he withdrew from the niche, whipped a trowel\r\nfrom under his robe and began to wall up the narrow opening. I knew it\r\nwas not a joke, a drunken jest. I saw that his drunkenness had fallen\r\nfrom him. The dying flambeau fell from my nerveless hand and cast a\r\nfitful bloody glow upon the whitened, dripping walls. I shook the chain\r\nfrenziedly.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Montresor!” I cried.\r\n\r\nHe replied with a horrible, mocking laugh, and, like a devil from hell,\r\nlifted his voice with mine to show that it was idle to call for help.\r\n\r\nI had always distrusted Montresor. I knew him to be a serpent. He\r\nfeared me and was jealous of my person and attainments. In spite of all\r\nhis fawning and his smiles, I knew he hated me deeply for the injuries\r\nI had heaped upon him and for the open insults I had added to them. And\r\nyet I swear he had never in the slightest suspected that it was not\r\nGiovanna, the tenor, who was successful with his wife, but _I_!\r\n\r\n“Fortunato!” he called, and his hoarse tone echoed in a ghastly way\r\nthrough the gloomy catacombs of his ancestors and re-echoed along the\r\nwinding crypt.\r\n\r\nI made no reply. Cold beads of fear started from my brow as I strained\r\nagainst the chain and listened to the soft thud of the stones he was\r\nbuilding into the opening to make my tomb and the accompanying tinkle\r\nof his trowel. Even then, I admired, perforce, the cleverness with\r\nwhich he had secured his revenge.\r\n\r\nIt was the night of the carnival. He had found me in the streets, dazed\r\nwith wine, and, pretending that he wanted my judgment on a cask of\r\nsherry, had lured my staggering feet into the gloomy passages under\r\nhis _palazzo_. And he had brought me into this narrow niche in the\r\ncastle walls to entomb me alive where no one would ever find me. It was\r\n_clever_!\r\n\r\nMy memory fails me now, but I doubt not I cried out many times for\r\npity and mercy; and I take no shame in thinking this may have been so.\r\nI recall his words and his horrible mouthings as he worked with more\r\nhaste and zeal than skill.\r\n\r\nBut I was a brave man always. I did not yield myself to fate. It was\r\nunthinkable. I, _Fortunato_, to die walled in by Montresor! I cursed\r\nhim and his line. I wrenched at the chain with ferocious strength, more\r\neager to have him by the throat than to be free to live. I called upon\r\nall the saints and particularly to my patron saint. You shall see that\r\nI was not unheard.\r\n\r\nThe wall grew high--to his breast--and in the light of his flambeau set\r\nsomewhere in the wall outside I could see Montresor’s sweating face as\r\nhe labored with the stones.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he thrust his torch through the opening, now no larger than\r\nhis head--and to deceive him I prostrated myself upon the floor and\r\nlaughed the laugh of a dying man.\r\n\r\nI heard the _thud_ of another stone, and looked up quickly. My flambeau\r\nhad died out: Montresor’s had disappeared. And there was no opening! I\r\nwas in a tomb of stone!\r\n\r\nAbsolute darkness surrounded me, and the walls seemed to press in upon\r\nme like icy blankets. And silence as absolute as the darkness reigned.\r\n\r\nI leaped to my feet. Silence! Silence, absolute silence, save for my\r\nown labored breathing. Maria! Suppose the mortar hardened ere I could\r\nthrow my weight against the poor wall he had built. Then I were lost!\r\n\r\nI called out aloud to my holy saint. Lucky it was that I had the bodily\r\nstrength of two. I strained upon the chain wildly; I seized it in my\r\nhands and tore at it with savage determination. I would not die thus!\r\nIn desperation, frantic with rage and fear, I made one last violent,\r\nprodigious effort to free myself, with strength enough to make the\r\npalazzo tremble, and in that last great effort the staples of the chain\r\ntore loose from the half-rotten stone in which they were fastened.\r\n\r\nHot tears of joy welled in my eyes. I vowed a hundred candles to the\r\nVirgin: but I could not then take time to give thanks.\r\n\r\nThrowing myself upon the wall Montresor had just reared, my feet\r\ndesperately braced on the rough floor, I fought for liberty like a\r\ntiger. Heavens! It _gave_!--the wall gave!\r\n\r\nIt yielded like a stiff canvas against the push of a hand, gave slowly,\r\nbut surely--bulged outward, then went rumbling down! I thrust myself\r\nthrough the jagged opening into the catacombs. I was free!\r\n\r\nWhat joy if Montresor had been there, even though he wore his rapier\r\nand I had but my poinard!\r\n\r\nIt was very dark, and yet I could see a gleam of light in the direction\r\nfrom which we had come, Montresor crazed with the thought of sweet\r\nrevenge, I drunk with wine. I paused and thought. Should I find him in\r\nthe streets in this gay time and slay him. No! I laughed insanely, yet\r\nclearly. No! There was a better thing to do.\r\n\r\nWith haste and no mean skill, I built up the wall anew, closing the\r\nopening of what might have been my tomb--had I been a weak man--and\r\nagainst this new wall erected a rampart of old bones; then, thrusting\r\nthe dangling ends of the chain within my doublet, began to retrace my\r\nfeet toward freedom.\r\n\r\nI struck my foot against some small, soft object, and halted with a\r\nstart. I leaned over. I had kicked against Montresor’s mask, and I put\r\nit over my face.\r\n\r\nI knew that all of his servants were away to enjoy the carnival, but\r\nit would do no harm to wear this mask--and it served my purpose. I\r\npassed through the crypt and walked back swiftly and steadily through\r\nthe range of low arches through which I had come staggering to an awful\r\ndoom.\r\n\r\nSoon I was above in my false friend’s rich suites in the cheerful glow\r\nof many lights. But all was quiet. No one stirred. I was alone--safe!\r\n\r\nI went light-footed through the deserted house--I could hear the shouts\r\nand laughter of the merry people in the street--until I came to the\r\npassage leading to the plaza.\r\n\r\nThere I stopped, with the blood jumping through my veins like wildfire.\r\nIn this hall, in the corner upon a low settee, lay Montresor, sprawling\r\nin a heavy stupor, as drunk with wine as I had been when I had\r\ntrustfully entered within his doors. I paused over his body. Within my\r\nbosom was the dagger with which I never part. And yet I let him lie\r\nthere unharmed.\r\n\r\nWhen I elbowed my way, masked, through the square, it was twelve\r\no’clock. I was in time to keep my appointment with his wife! I laughed.\r\nWhat a jest!\r\n\r\nAnd Montresor’s wife was awaiting me in the usual place. Such a\r\nbeautiful woman! I really loved her--and I hoped _he_ did.\r\n\r\nI was as clever as I was brave--I was, indeed, an exceedingly clever\r\nman. I had seen my creditors pressing and all things turning toward\r\nruin, and that was why I had converted everything possible into gold\r\nand precious stones.\r\n\r\nThat night I crept unseen into my own house, from which my servants,\r\nlike Montresor’s, had stolen away to enjoy the carnival, and, securing\r\nall the wealth I had secreted, was up and away, my chain stricken\r\noff by an obscure armorer. I have no doubt that my body-servant was\r\nexecuted for the theft of my fortune--as indeed he should have been for\r\nwatching my belongings so poorly. But I know not.\r\n\r\nThen we left the city while the streets were still crowded and\r\ngay--Montresor’s wife and I--and went to England, where we have lived a\r\nlong life very happily.\r\n\r\nYears ago I heard a vague rumor that Montresor believed his beautiful\r\nwife had gone away with Giovanna, the tenor, who disappeared at about\r\nthat time. But it was not so. As for Lady Fortunato--she may have\r\nguessed the truth.\r\n\r\nAnd Montresor will believe until he dies that my bones lie crumbling in\r\nthe little walled-in dungeon below his palazzo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Weaving\r\n                                Shadows\r\n\r\n                           _By_ W. H. HOLMES\r\n\r\n\r\nChet Burke was lazily reclining in his favorite easy chair, absorbed\r\nin a rare book on alchemy and black magic, when his sister answered a\r\nsummons at the door.\r\n\r\nIn addition to managing the household affairs of the apartment in which\r\nshe and Burke lived alone, her duties also consisted in scrutinizing\r\nthe many visitors. Most of them could be persuaded to call at the\r\nbook stall, which Burke conducted when not devoted to some criminal\r\nmystery that held him until it was solved. Others, whose cases were\r\nurgent, were admitted to the apartment, thus infringing on Burke’s only\r\nrecreation, reading and study.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were Chief Rhyne, a friend of Burke’s, of the Rhyne\r\nDetective Agency, and a stranger.\r\n\r\nBurke laid aside his book and greeted the callers with a friendly nod.\r\nRhyne, a portly, flushed man, settled his sturdy body into a convenient\r\nchair. The stranger, an intelligent-looking man, appeared ill at ease.\r\nHe stood self-consciously beside Rhyne, absently running the brim of\r\nhis soft hat through browned, muscular-looking fingers.\r\n\r\n“Burke,” grunted Rhyne heavily, “meet Mr. Hayden. He is bothered about\r\na very mysterious affair. It has worked on his nerves until he has\r\ndecided to consult an expert. It’s beyond me, so I brought him around\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nRhyne sighed with relief, and eased back in his chair.\r\n\r\nHayden stuck out a rough, calloused hand to Burke. His bronzed face\r\nflushed slightly at Rhyne’s statement.\r\n\r\n“I am more concerned,” he said, in a surprisingly agreeable voice,\r\n“about how you will receive what I have to relate. I can hardly believe\r\nyet that the things exist, although I have seen them three nights in\r\nsuccession.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head in doubt, and sat down mechanically in the chair that\r\nBurke drew up.\r\n\r\nWhile Hayden was gathering his thoughts, Burke quietly sized him up.\r\nHayden appeared to be a man of about forty-five. His face was deeply\r\ntanned, and his appearance suggested many hours spent out of doors.\r\nBurke noted at once his trait of eying one direct from warm brown eyes.\r\nHe was garbed quietly, and evidently in his best. His dark suit was set\r\noff by square-toed shoes, above which glared white socks. A low, soft,\r\nwhite collar, with a black string tie, completed his obviously habitual\r\nconcession to dress. On the whole, Hayden struck the detective as a\r\nwholesome type of the practical mechanic.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Hayden,” said Burke musingly, his eyes half closed and\r\nvacant, “state your case fully. We will try not to interrupt you.”\r\n\r\nThe detective lounged down in his chair, his heavy lips slightly\r\ndrooping, and his long legs crossed indolently in front of him. His\r\neyes had their customary vague stare through the tortoise-shell glasses\r\nthat veiled them.\r\n\r\nHayden drew a long breath, then exhaled it in a long sigh. With a brisk\r\nstraightening of his shoulders he said:\r\n\r\n“I am a carpenter. Until recently, or, to be exact, until four days\r\nago, I lived in New Orleans. I am a bachelor, and it doesn’t make much\r\ndifference to me where I live, so long as I can find work at my trade.\r\nTherefore I came up here, to Sunken Mine, in the Highlands of the\r\nHudson, to live with a widowed sister and her daughter.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and his eyes grew reflective. For a moment he was evidently\r\nmeasuring his words. With a quick intake of his breath, he resumed:\r\n\r\n“My sister lives in an aged, pre-Revolutionary house, deep in the\r\nmountains. It is a lonely place, and a secluded dwelling. At one time\r\nit was probably a restful appearing country farmhouse. Today it is a\r\nweathered frame building, set in a grove of dead and whitened chestnut\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n“The house is a one-story-and-attic affair, with rough stone fireplaces\r\nat the side, and a long sloping roof that pitches low at the rear.\r\nOwing to its age and the condition of the place, it is a dreary\r\nspot for one used to the city. My sister affects ancient, antique\r\nfurnishings, which does not lessen the impression of living in the\r\npast. As soon as I crossed the door-sill I was affected by this vague,\r\nmisty remembrance of being there before.\r\n\r\n“It may strike you as strange that my sister picked out a place of\r\nthis type to spend the remainder of her days. But she had, to her\r\nand her daughter, good reasons. Both she and my niece are earnest\r\nspiritualists. Both receive messages, and are, in truth, sincere\r\nmediums. For some reason, my sister claims that the atmosphere of the\r\nold dwelling helps them to materialize those that have gone before. I\r\nmyself have considerable faith in those things, although I treat it in\r\na practical manner. I only believe what I actually see. What I am about\r\nto relate, I have both seen and _felt_.”\r\n\r\nHayden paused for an instant to stare earnestly at Burke. The detective\r\nnodded to him to continue.\r\n\r\n“I have read deeply,” went on Hayden, “and in my spare time I could\r\nbe called a bookworm. I work at my trade, but live much in the past,\r\nespecially in books. For this reason, I could be sympathetic to my\r\nsister’s idea of living close to her life’s hobby, or her ‘mission,’ as\r\nshe calls it.\r\n\r\n“There is one more reason why my sister purchased the place, six weeks\r\nago. It was the original settling place of the family, before the\r\nRevolution. As the result of a family tragedy, some hundred years or\r\nmore ago, the place passed into other hands. Few new buildings are\r\nconstructed in that sparsely settled, unfertile section, and most of\r\nthe houses have stood for generations. Consequently, the old Hayden\r\nhouse was never disturbed. At the time it came back into the family it\r\nwas vacant and for sale.\r\n\r\n“They had been living there about two months when I came there to live\r\nwith them. The room I occupied Sunday night is on the second floor. It\r\nis a semi-attic room, lit by one window. Before I came, the room was\r\noccupied by my niece. On my arrival it was arranged for me, and the\r\ngirl and her mother occupied a bedroom downstairs.\r\n\r\n“It was around eleven-thirty Sunday night when I went to bed, and was\r\nsoon asleep. I awoke with the feeling that something was stifling me.\r\nIt was as if I had a heavy cold and found difficulty in breathing.\r\nThis peculiar sensation of suffocation finally caused me to rouse into\r\ncomplete wakefulness. The strange smothering seemed to ease as I got\r\nmore fully awake. Unable to fall asleep again, I lay looking out of the\r\nwindow at the stars. The bed is at the end of the room, and the window\r\nwas in direct sight.\r\n\r\n“The house was intensely still. I noticed this in particular, as\r\nI remarked the absence of the city noises I had been used to. I\r\ncan’t recollect that there was so much as an insect stirring. My own\r\nbreathing, as in imagination I still struggled for breath, was the only\r\nsound. It appeared to fill the room with a hoarse, rasping murmur. I\r\nlikened myself to a dying man, gasping his last breath. This fancy,\r\nto one of my usual practical trend, was perplexing to myself. Still,\r\nin the few moments before the things appeared, my thoughts apparently\r\ndwelt on uncanny ideas. At the same time I was conscious of a queer\r\ntingling of my body.\r\n\r\n“As I lay staring at the faint light of the sky, I slowly became\r\nconscious of a singular illusion, or, as I am at times led to believe,\r\na startling visitation. The dark shadows of the room appeared to be\r\ndancing rapidly before my eyes. They were streaming in long wreaths,\r\ncoiling in fantastic spirals, and wafting through the room in wide,\r\nlevel films of blackness.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how I could see this, but it was plainly visible. Yet the\r\nroom, except for the faint light that came from the clear, moonless\r\nsky, was in fairly deep darkness. It seemed that the moving shadows\r\nthat formed before my eyes were only discernible because of their\r\ngreater density. I can only liken this uncanny movement of the shadows\r\nto swaying and floating clouds of tobacco smoke, when one is smoking\r\nslowly and freely.\r\n\r\n“For some moments I watched the movements of the shadows. Then I\r\nobserved that they were forming in a more stable order. They were\r\nnow lying in long, round coils of blackness, horizontally across the\r\nroom, and twisting rapidly. For several moments they lay motionless,\r\nexcept for their rapid turning, then, as if stirred by a firm direct\r\nbreeze, they undulated toward the head of the stairs. This drift\r\nbrought several horizontal layers into contact. At the moment of their\r\ntouching, the shadows seemed to weave into huge rolls, which streamed\r\nfrom sight rapidly down the stairs. The room now appeared to grow\r\nlighter, and the air clearer. Also, all sensation of smothering had\r\nleft me.\r\n\r\n“I lay there quietly after the disappearance of the shadows, pondering\r\nover the strange affair. So far, I was fairly calm, except for the\r\nwonderment of the thing. The return of the shadows was cause of my\r\nfears and suspense as to the final outcome.\r\n\r\n“My eyes were gazing absently out of the window, as I had not turned\r\nmy eyes from the stairs after the black rolls had streamed down them.\r\nSlowly, so slowly that it scarcely seemed to move, I saw a black,\r\nhumanlike form rise above the sill of the window. I could just see\r\nthe top of it as it mounted the stairs. I watched it with a keen\r\nrealization that it had something to do with the shadows.\r\n\r\n“Very slowly, almost imperceptibly, the round, headlike shape continued\r\nto rise. I could now see it plainly, outlined against the lighter\r\nsky. The shape now rose to its full height. It had the form of a\r\nshapeless human figure. That is, I could distinguish the smaller head\r\nshadow above, and what would answer for a body, if one were at all\r\nimaginative. The thing passed beyond the window and drifted into the\r\ndarkness at the end of the room. Yet, I could still make out its vague\r\nform by its greater blackness.\r\n\r\n“My eyes went back to the window. Another figure was slowly blocking\r\nthe cheerful light of the sky. Again a black form emerged to its full\r\nheight. It joined the first. I am not a coward. I lay quiet, wondering\r\nwhat the thing presaged.\r\n\r\n“The two figures advanced to the center of the room. They were now\r\nfairly discernible. One of them walked to an old-fashioned dresser\r\nat one side of the room, stood there a moment, then joined the other\r\nfigure. With this, both shapes turned and passed down the stairs.\r\n\r\n“As they were disappearing, I called. The forms were so clear, and\r\nI was by this time so far from sleep, that my mind hit on a logical\r\nreason to explain the thing. It was evidently my sister and my niece.\r\nThey had wanted something from the dresser, and, not wishing to disturb\r\nme, had come up quietly, got what they wanted, and then returned to\r\ntheir room.\r\n\r\n“Getting no answer to my call, I sprang out of bed to convince myself\r\nof the truth of my belief. I went downstairs, and to their room. Both\r\nwere in bed and fast asleep. I awoke them. Neither one had been up\r\nsince retiring. I did not tell them of the black forms, but made some\r\nexcuse for awakening them. The remainder of the night I spent in the\r\nkitchen, sleeping in a large rocking chair.”\r\n\r\nHayden paused and stared at Burke.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Burke shortly. “This would not have brought you to me.”\r\nHayden shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “it was what came after. This same night, as I arose\r\nfrom the bed, following the disappearance of the two forms down the\r\nstairway, I had reached the center of the room when I became conscious\r\nof standing in something that was wet to my feet. I was barefooted, and\r\nwhen I looked at my feet I found them soiled with blood.\r\n\r\n“Naturally I thought that I had cut myself; but a close examination\r\nrevealed no cut or bruise of any sort. I lit a lamp and went back\r\nupstairs. My first glance was at the spot where I had first felt\r\nthe wetness. A glance revealed the cause. Directly in the center of\r\nthe bare board floor was a large pool of fresh blood. It was slowly\r\nspreading out over the floor, and sinking into the dry wood. I cleaned\r\nit up as much as possible, and then searched the room thoroughly. There\r\nwas absolutely nothing that I could find that would explain the blood.\r\n\r\n“The next morning, both my sister and my niece complained of feeling\r\nlanguid and fagged. My niece, a very white, frail girl, was even more\r\ncolorless than usual, and her mother, noticeable for her deep intense\r\neyes and the black rings that encircle them, seemed listless and\r\nindifferent to everything. Noting this, I scrubbed up the bloodstains\r\nbefore they made up the room, and said nothing of what I had seen.\r\n\r\n“Things were normal until Monday night. Again, about the same hour,\r\nI was awakened by a smothering sensation. Once more I heard my own\r\nbreathing as I gasped for air. As I got more fully awake, I found that\r\nthe smothering sensation grew more intense. I sat up in bed, crouched\r\nover like one suffering with the asthma, and striving to fill my lungs\r\nwith air. But this did not relieve my distress.\r\n\r\n“Unconsciously, my eyes were fixed across the dark room. Again occurred\r\nthe weaving of the shadows. Panting, stifling, and seemingly unable to\r\narouse myself enough to get out of bed, I watched the repetition of the\r\nscene of the previous night. Once the horizontal streams of shadows\r\nwere formed, my breathing became more normal, and I seemed to regain\r\nthe power to move and think clearly.\r\n\r\n“I then deliberately waited to see the finish of the affair. The banks\r\nof twisting shadows disappeared down the stairway, and the two figures\r\nrepeated their previous trip. As soon as they had descended past the\r\nwindow, I sprang from bed and lit my lamp. My eyes went at once to the\r\nfloor. The pool of fresh blood was there for the second time. I let\r\nit lay and tiptoed down stairs, and to the women’s room. Both were in\r\na sound sleep, but I was struck at once by the haggardness of their\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n“I did not awake them. Getting a basin and water, I returned upstairs.\r\nI again scrubbed up the floor, this time with much care, as the stain\r\nhad now gone deep into the aged boards. Leaving the lamp lit, I went\r\nback to bed. Finally I fell asleep. Nothing occurred during the\r\nremainder of the night.\r\n\r\n“The morning after this second visitation,” resumed Hayden, “I again\r\nremarked the extreme pallor of my niece and the haggard, gaunt face of\r\nher mother. Still, I remained silent, determined to solve the riddle\r\nfor myself.\r\n\r\n“Last night I retired early, and I took several precautions. First, I\r\nsecured an electric flashlight. Next, I powdered the stairs with flour.\r\nI also sprinkled the floor on the attic room. I now had a trap that no\r\nhuman being, or any mechanical figure, could tread over without leaving\r\na trace. This done, I blew out the lamp and went to bed.\r\n\r\n“I lay awake for a matter of two or three hours. I was determined to\r\nstay awake until the shadows commenced to form, or until I began to\r\nfeel the smothering sensation. In this way, I would have a grasp on it\r\nfrom beginning to end. But in spite of my resolution, I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n“I was again awakened by an uncanny feeling. Firm hands, or, rather,\r\nsome peculiar force, seemed to hold my arms down on the bed. I sought\r\nto draw up my legs in order to slip out of bed, but found them held by\r\nan unyielding power. Finally, I discovered that I was unable to move\r\nany part of my body. I was certainly awake, yet I was as helpless as a\r\nperson in a nightmare, who fancies that his body is totally paralyzed.\r\n\r\n“Forced to lay motionless, I saw the black shadows stream from various\r\nparts of the room. This time they formed over my bed. I could feel them\r\ndrift across my face, spinning, waving, and twisting and contorting. It\r\nwas an unearthly feeling, lying there helpless to avert anything that\r\nmight happen. There is nothing I can describe that would be similar\r\nto the feeling of those black forms, ceaselessly in motion. It might\r\nbe likened to some invisible force that presses on one, or to a heavy\r\nfog that a person seems to feel in a material manner, with a strong\r\nimpression of its dampness and chill.\r\n\r\n“This helplessness and the weaving of the shadows went on for\r\nperhaps five minutes. Then, as the twisting rolls started to stream\r\ndown the stairs, I could feel my body regaining its power. With the\r\ndisappearance of the materializing forms, I became physically and\r\nmentally myself again.\r\n\r\n“I then got the electric torch in my hand, ready to flash it at the\r\nproper moment. The figures rose above the stair, and I directed the\r\nbulb of the light toward them. I waited until they advanced to the\r\ncenter of the room, then I threw on the light.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHayden wiped his mouth with a trembling hand. His lips were dry, and\r\nhis face flushed.\r\n\r\nThen, with a slight shudder, he went on:\r\n\r\n“At the instant of the flash, the darkness of the figures was gone.\r\nInstead, I saw two faces. They were inhuman, horrible, and impossible\r\nto describe. They leered at me with their shadowy, devilish faces,\r\nscarcely discernible in the glow of the torch. They seemed to be\r\nmocking me. They were corpse-looking and repulsive, but the eyes\r\nwere terrible. They were full and real, and glowing, with a hellish,\r\nvengeful fire. But with all the horribleness of the faces, it was not\r\nthey that held me motionless.\r\n\r\n“It was at that moment that I discovered the source of the blood. It\r\nwas dripping out of the air, and falling in a steady patter. I glanced\r\nup at the ceiling, but it was firm and unbroken. While I watched--it\r\nwas scarcely a second--the drops seemed to form in the air above the\r\nfloor. They were rapidly ceasing when my nerves gave way for the\r\nmoment, and I let out an involuntary yell. With the cry, the dripping\r\nblood suddenly ceased and the faces vanished.\r\n\r\n“This brought me to my senses. I sprang from bed, determined to see\r\nthe thing through. My first act was to scan my trap. I followed the\r\nflour down the stairs, but it lay in a white, unbroken dust, as I had\r\nscattered it. That night, also, I looked in on the women. Both were\r\nsound asleep. But I was deeply shocked by their distorted faces. Shaken\r\nboth mentally and bodily, I once more spent the rest of the night in\r\nthe kitchen rocker.\r\n\r\n“And now I want some one to go up there with me, examine the house, and\r\nspend the night in the room. I am troubled, nervous, and frightened:\r\nboth for myself and for those with whom I live.”\r\n\r\n“I will go there with you,” replied Burke evenly, “and I think the two\r\nof us should accomplish something. We can probably handle two shadowy\r\nforms.”\r\n\r\nHayden smiled dolefully.\r\n\r\n“They handled me last night,” he said ruefully. “I’m a pretty strong\r\nman, but something held me as helpless as a baby.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBurke alighted at a lonely way-station, standing on a strip of land\r\nbetween a wide marsh and the Hudson.\r\n\r\nThe marsh ran to the foot of the mountains, and lay sear and rippling\r\nin the September breeze. Hayden had stated that the dwelling stood back\r\nin the hills, a distance of some five miles. On Burke’s suggestion,\r\nthey started to walk. Burke wanted to study the country, and,\r\nincidentally, study his companion.\r\n\r\nThe country he found to be sparsely settled. The road wound up through\r\nforest-clad rocky hills. The dwelling stood beside a wide stretch of\r\nwoods, with cleared fields to the north.\r\n\r\nBurke scanned the dwelling as he approached it, and found it to be the\r\nusual type of farm house of a century ago, buried among dead trees.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the house was in keeping with the exterior. Oval\r\nframes held old prints, horse-hair upholstered, massive dark furniture\r\ncontrasted with tables and stands covered with white marble tops,\r\nthe chairs squatted grimly in the quiet rooms and rested on dull\r\nrag carpets. The woman and her daughter struck Burke like beings\r\ntransported from the misty past.\r\n\r\nThe mother was a tall, sparse woman, with heavy black rings about the\r\neyes. The eyes, black and dreamy, held Burke with a steady, unwinking\r\nstare. The daughter was the opposite of her dark, sallow mother. She\r\nseemed a lifeless, colorless sprite, seemingly alive by the power and\r\nvigor of her more intense mother. She was about twenty years of age,\r\nalthough her chalky face, and thin, bloodless hands, together with her\r\nslight frame and indolent movements, seemed to signify an elder age, or\r\nsome wasting disease. Both were of the dreaming, musing type, speaking\r\nsoftly and briefly, and moving silently about the quiet house, and both\r\nwere garbed in dresses of white material.\r\n\r\nBurke’s first act was to visit the room upstairs. There was nothing to\r\nwarrant his attention except the stained floor. He ripped up several\r\nsplinters and put them in his pocket. He then announced his intention\r\nof visiting the nearest town, several miles to the south.\r\n\r\nHayden asked no questions, evidently placing the affair entirely in\r\nBurke’s hands. He remarked that he would “walk down a ways” with the\r\ndetective, and await his return.\r\n\r\nThe two women were still unaware of Burke’s vocation, and accepted\r\nwithout comment Hayden’s statement that Burke was a friend that was to\r\nremain over night.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as Burke arrived in town, he went at once to the Chief of\r\nPolice. Here he inquired for some one qualified to make an examination\r\nof the bloodstained splinters. He was directed to a doctor who\r\nmaintained a laboratory. The latter, after a lengthy analysis,\r\nconfessed himself puzzled. Something was missing in the composition. He\r\ncould not account for the peculiar results he obtained. It was human\r\nblood--and yet it was not.\r\n\r\nBurke returned to the Chief of Police and inquired about the Haydens.\r\nThe Chief was unable to give Burke any satisfaction, but directed\r\nhim to an old settler in the vicinity who could probably furnish the\r\ndesired information.\r\n\r\nBurke found the family without trouble. They were willing to talk, but\r\nthey knew very little about the Haydens--though a good deal about the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOver a hundred years before, they said, a widow and her niece had\r\nlived in the then new dwelling. The place, a flourishing farm, which\r\nhad since been cut up and sold off, was managed by the woman’s\r\nstep-brother. The family were more or less secluded, and seldom seen.\r\n\r\nIn the course of weeks it was noticed that no one had seen the two\r\nwomen. The brother was at the house alone, and refused to talk. This\r\nled to an investigation. No trace of the women was found. The brother\r\nwas never brought to trial, continued to live on the place until he\r\ndied of old age, and had prospered. His heirs had taken over the\r\nplace, and it had been gradually dissipated, until only the house and\r\nan acre or so of land remained.\r\n\r\nBurke listened politely, then, thanking the old couple, returned to the\r\nHayden house. Hayden was awaiting him.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Burke sat beside the open fireplace, listening to the\r\nlow, earnest conversation of the others. The woman and her daughter he\r\nobserved closely. They seemed to be possessed of some restless emotion\r\nthat caused them to wander aimlessly around. On the contrary, Hayden\r\nappeared to be sluggish and incapable of extended speech. This struck\r\nBurke as queer, as he had remarked the vivid description Hayden had\r\ngiven of the attic room.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock the women announced their intention of retiring. Bidding\r\nthe two men good-night, they withdrew to their rooms. Burke and Hayden,\r\nthe latter almost stupid and listless in his movements, went up the\r\nnarrow stairs to the room above.\r\n\r\nBoth lay on the bed fully robed. Burke saw Hayden take a revolver from\r\nhis pocket and shove it under his pillow.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” asked Hayden heavily, seemingly unconscious of\r\nanything around him and staring vacantly at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Burke quietly, “first, we will blow out the lamp.”\r\n\r\nHe got out of bed and put out the light. Returning, he crawled on\r\nthe further side of Hayden, leaving Hayden on the outside. Burke had\r\nno desire to be on the firing side of the revolver in the event that\r\nHayden should start shooting.\r\n\r\nThe detective lay for an hour, pondering over the strange case. Finally\r\nhe spoke to Hayden. The latter did not reply. He was apparently fast\r\nasleep. Yet, as Burke listened closely, he could discern no signs of\r\nthe latter’s breathing.\r\n\r\nBurke now experienced a singular emotion aroused by the intense\r\nsilence of the room. The longer he lay the more impressive it became.\r\nDownstairs he heard the low chime of a clock. It struck eleven. The\r\nminutes lagged along in the forbidding silence.\r\n\r\nThe clock chimed the half hour. Fifteen more minutes passed. Hayden,\r\nbreathing heavily now, commenced to move. Burke half arose on his elbow\r\nand listened. Hayden was muttering in his sleep.\r\n\r\nBurke eyed the dark shadows of the room with keen eyes. Nothing met his\r\ngaze. He glanced to the window. Nothing there. Hayden was suffering\r\ntortures in his struggle for breath.\r\n\r\nThe detective was on the point of shaking him, when, with a heavy,\r\nprolonged gasp, Hayden sat up. Burke sensed the horror of the man, yet\r\nhe remained motionless. His eyes were fixed on the dark, silent room,\r\nwandering frequently to the window.\r\n\r\nNothing unusual was to be seen, and he watched the vague form of his\r\nbed-mate. The latter was now rigid, struggling with the weight that\r\noppressed his lungs, and apparently staring off into the room. Then, to\r\nBurke’s amazement, Hayden started to breathe normally.\r\n\r\n“Burke,” he whispered hoarsely, “did you see it? Did you see them pass\r\ndown the stairs?”\r\n\r\n“Eh?” grunted Burke sleepily.\r\n\r\n“My God!” muttered Hayden, “you were to watch, and you fall asleep.\r\nThey have gone down the stairs. They’ll come back again in four or five\r\nminutes. Watch!”\r\n\r\nBurke made no reply. He, with his wide-awake companion, was staring\r\nintently at the window. Suddenly he felt Hayden stiffen.\r\n\r\n“The head is just coming up the stairs!” whispered Hayden.\r\n\r\nBurke felt the movement of Hayden’s arm as it slid under the pillow.\r\nThen came the blinding flash of the revolver and its roar. Twice Hayden\r\npulled the trigger. By that time Burke had flashed on his electric\r\ntorch. The room was empty. Burke glanced at the floor. No blood was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nHayden was panting and rocking back and forth.\r\n\r\n“I feel awful queer,” he groaned. “Something is dragging me.”\r\n\r\nMechanically he arose from the bed and stumbled onto the floor.\r\n\r\n“It tells me to kill, _kill_!” he mumbled. “Kill with my revolver.\r\nKill--who shall I kill?”\r\n\r\nBurke silently followed the plodding form of the other. With measured\r\nsteps Hayden stalked to the stairs and passed down, with Burke close\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nHayden led the way directly to the room of his sister and niece.\r\nWithout hesitating, his fingers grasping a loaded “Billy,” Burke\r\ntrailed close and waited for the moment when he should be needed.\r\n\r\nHayden appeared unconscious of the light furnished by Burke’s torch,\r\nnor did he once turn on the short journey. Reaching the side of the bed\r\nin which the women were sleeping, he paused and stared rigidly down.\r\n\r\nBurke joined him. His light was now on the two women. He was struck by\r\nthe horrible contortions of the faces, seemingly drawn in agony.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden premonition, he bent down and felt the motionless forms.\r\nThe girl’s hand was limp and lifeless. He felt the pulse of the older\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n_Both were dead!_\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe detective turned to Hayden.\r\n\r\nHe was staring down, dry-eyed.\r\n\r\n“I see,” he said stupidly, “both dead. Kill, _kill_--who was I to kill?\r\nNot them. They’re dead. Something still tells me to kill!” He sank into\r\na chair and buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nBurke lit a lamp that stood on a heavy dresser and put out the torch.\r\nHe stood looking down at the two women. He then noted that the room was\r\ngrowing shadowy. He glanced at the lamp. It was full of oil and the\r\nwick seemed to be burning freely, yet the light continued to lower.\r\n\r\nBurke again glanced at the two women. Slowly, almost invisibly, he\r\nfancied that the agonized features were changing to the repose of death.\r\n\r\nHayden arose and came to the detective’s side. He was muttering and\r\nsoftly moaning. Burke watched him.\r\n\r\nHayden, with a sudden start, looked across the room.\r\n\r\n“They’re coming back!” he mumbled, “weaving and twisting.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes moved slowly from the opposite side of the room as if he were\r\nfollowing some moving object. They came to rest on the women’s faces.\r\n\r\n“Streaming down their mouths!” he muttered. “They’re sucking in the\r\ntwisting rolls. _They’re coming to life!_”\r\n\r\nBurke glanced at the women. In the dim light he could have sworn that\r\nhe saw traces of returning life. At that moment there came a crashing\r\nreport at his side and a blinding flash.\r\n\r\nWith that, the light flared up bright, and the dead faces were\r\nrevealed. Burke whirled around.\r\n\r\nHayden was sinking to the floor, a bullet hole in his head, from which\r\nthe blood was slowly starting to emerge. Burke sank beside the man and\r\nlifted his head.\r\n\r\nSlowly the heavy form relaxed. Hayden opened his eyes to stare with\r\nbewilderment at the detective.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was dead.\r\n\r\nBurke placed the body on the floor and went to the bed. Once again\r\nhe endeavored to find a trace of pulse in the still forms. Both were\r\nlifeless. He fancied that both dead faces bore a peaceful look, and\r\non the elder woman’s slightly-opened lips there seemed to hover an\r\nexultant smile.\r\n\r\nClosing the room, Burke got his coat and belongings, then locked up\r\nthe house. Some hours later he was sitting with the Chief of Police,\r\nrelating the tragedy. The Chief drove with Burke to the Sheriff of the\r\ncounty, and together they went to the house. The Sheriff had called up\r\nthe coroner, and they found him waiting for them.\r\n\r\nA brief examination of the women revealed that both had died of heart\r\nfailure, probably induced by some unexplainable shock. Burke took the\r\nSheriff aside. On the detective’s suggestion, they wrecked the attic\r\nroom in a thorough search. Burke wanted to locate the source of the\r\ndropping blood.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of their quest the mystery was finished, for Burke.\r\nBut it was to Rhyne that he confessed his failure.\r\n\r\nReturning to his apartment in New York, he found Rhyne there.\r\n\r\n“Well,” cried the latter, as soon as he appeared, “did you solve the\r\nmystery?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Burke. “I did not.”\r\n\r\nRhyne’s eyes opened. “Well--what did you find?”\r\n\r\n“Over the attic room,” said Burke musingly, “we found a small,\r\ncryptlike space between the ceiling of the attic room and the roof of\r\nthe house. It was encased in plaster. As we broke through the ceiling,\r\na mass of human bones came tumbling down. The coroner pronounced them\r\nthe skeletons of a woman and a girl. Both had been dead for generations.\r\n\r\n“Through the shoulder blade of the girl’s skeleton was a jagged hole.\r\nWhen the bones fell, the elder woman’s skull rolled to my feet. I\r\npicked it up. Something rattled inside and I worked it out through the\r\neye socket. It was a slug of lead.\r\n\r\n“Both the woman and the girl had been murdered.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Queer Tribe of Savages\r\n                            Found in Africa\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest tribes in Africa is that of the El Molo. Ruled\r\nby a blind chief, they live on an island near the east shore of Lake\r\nRudolf in East Africa, their shelter being crude huts fashioned from\r\npalm leaves. They live entirely on fish, which they spear and eat raw,\r\nand they drink nothing except the water in the lake, which the white\r\nman considers unfit to drink. It is said they cannot live for more than\r\nan hour without water, their lips swelling and bleeding if they try to\r\ngo longer. They use a language of their own, different from that of the\r\nother African tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     African Brides Must Be Plump\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wild tribes of Africa consider no girl beautiful unless she is\r\nabnormally fat. Hence their young girls are fed on milk and fattening\r\nfoods, and are not permitted to exercise. This forced fattening is not\r\nonly a necessary preparation for marriage--it is also good business for\r\na girl’s parents. When a girl marries, the bridegroom pays her parents\r\nfor her, and the amount he pays is based on the degree of plumpness of\r\nthe bride whom they have fattened for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Odd, Fantastic Little Story\r\n  of the Stone Age_\r\n\r\n                              Nimba, the\r\n                                Cave Girl\r\n\r\n                          _By_ R. T. M. Scott\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thousands of years ago, when the poles of the earth were its\r\npleasant spots and when the tropics were too hot for human life, Nimba\r\ngrew to her full height and was still a maid.\r\n\r\nMany had been her suitors, but, from the time she had pulled down her\r\nfirst wild animal, she had lived much apart from others of her kind\r\nand had become known as a mighty traveler and hunter. She could run a\r\nhundred miles in one day over the worst kind of country, and she had\r\nmatched her brains successfully against the most wonderful of animal\r\ncunning. Unaided, she could support herself, and she did not want a\r\nmate--at least, not yet.\r\n\r\nSomewhere, not far south of what is now called James Bay, is a\r\nbeautiful lake lying between steep-sloping, wood-covered hills. At one\r\nend of this lake a great boulder once stood, heaving its huge mass a\r\nfull hundred feet above the water. At its back the steep hillside gave\r\naccess to its summit. At its front the water rippled or dashed against\r\none hundred feet of straight wall.\r\n\r\nYet not quite perfect was this wall. In its very center, and slightly\r\noverhanging the lake, was a tiny cave, an irregular cavity large enough\r\nto shelter two or three people. Fifty feet above the water and fifty\r\nfeet below the top of the great rock, this natural shelter against\r\nrain or enemy seemed inaccessible to anything without wings. But the\r\nskin of a long-haired animal was stretched to dry against the back of\r\nthis little cave--pegged to the cracks and crannies by means of great\r\nthorns. Scattered here and there were bleached bones--relics of past\r\nmeals eaten by Nimba.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a hot afternoon, and the sun was beating the earth in its usual\r\nrelentless fury. To the south the great cloud-masses of steam were\r\nrising and tumbling upon themselves in rain, only to revaporize and\r\nrise again.\r\n\r\nThe air was still with a breathless quiet, which presaged continued\r\nfine weather and little danger of the hot humidity of the south being\r\nblown northward. On the eastern horizon a mighty mountain belched its\r\nhead off and sent a column of fire into the sky that rivaled the glare\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bushes parted behind the great rock-sentinel of the lake.\r\nNimba sprang out and ran to the highest vantage point. There she stood,\r\nmotionless, gazing at the burning mountain. Fire did not frighten her\r\nas it did the creatures which ran on four legs; rather it attracted her.\r\n\r\nShe stood long, viewing the new magnificence of the eastern horizon,\r\nher coppery-tanned skin glistening in the sun and her firm young\r\nbreasts rising and falling as if they, too, saw and wondered in dreamy\r\ncontemplation. Lithe were her legs and arms, and slender her waist,\r\nwith hips full big but boy-like in their taper. Her hair was bound\r\nwith little tendrils into a cue that reached below her waist and then\r\nwas doubled to keep it off the ground. Sunburned, its hue was a golden\r\nglory. A deep scar marked her face, but this only added to its barbaric\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden, she bent as in the act of listening and then leaped back\r\ninto the bushes, only to return with a small animal she had killed,\r\nand dragging behind her a stout creeper of great length. Fastening one\r\nend of the creeper to a jutting rock, she threw the other end over\r\nthe face of the great boulder and, holding with one hand the animal’s\r\nleg, lowered herself to the cave in the wall with all the agility of a\r\nmonkey.\r\n\r\nScarcely had she entered her tiny abode before she noticed that her\r\ncreeper ladder was being violently agitated from above. She leaned far\r\nout from her cave in a perilous manner and saw descending toward her a\r\nlong pair of hairy legs followed by the rest of a man.\r\n\r\nPicking up a stout club from the back of her cave, Nimba waited until\r\nthe legs came within reach and then caught the man a blow on his thigh\r\nthat caused him to yell lustily and to ascend a few feet with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nHe did not entirely retreat, however, but, turning around like a\r\ncaterpillar on a thread, again descended, this time head first in order\r\nto keep a bright outlook.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNimba now saw the man’s face, and she disliked it more than his legs.\r\nHer small features convulsed with rage, and she spat at him and beat\r\nthe wall with her club in a frenzy. She knew him well.\r\n\r\nHe was Oomba, one of the strong and cruel men of her tribe. When he was\r\nfifteen he had killed his grandfather for a stoneheaded club. He had\r\ncaught the old man unawares, which act of caution had been construed\r\nas timidity so that he had few friends until he became too strong to\r\nwithstand.\r\n\r\nWhen Oomba had descended until his face was within twelve inches\r\nbeyond the reach of the girl’s club, he hung there, gloating over her\r\nwith greedy, lustful eyes. For half an hour he hung, face downward,\r\nsensuously intoning to the infuriated girl.\r\n\r\n“With me hunt! With me eat! With me sleep!”\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour Nimba was still spitting at him and still\r\nclubbing the wall with unabated energy.\r\n\r\n“Oomba go! Oomba go! Me you will not touch!” she screamed at intervals.\r\n\r\nFinally Oomba climbed back to the top of the rock--but he did not give\r\nup. He pulled the great creeper up after him. He would trap the little\r\nspit-cat, he thought, and so tame her.\r\n\r\nBut he did not know Nimba.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the object of her hatred became lost to sight Nimba calmed\r\nherself. When she saw her rope of escape withdrawn she waited for some\r\ntime in silence. Then she stepped to the edge of her cave home--and\r\nher body flashed forward through the sunlit air like a gleam of gold.\r\nFor fifty feet the gleam curved, then struck the water silently like a\r\nknife. Fifteen yards from where she struck, Nimba’s face appeared above\r\nthe surface glancing upward toward the top of the rock.\r\n\r\nOomba peering over the rock, witnessed Nimba’s mighty dive. For a\r\nmoment he scowled at her before dashing into the bushes just as Nimba\r\nswam into shallow water.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNimba rose near the shore, her club dripping in her hand. She bounded\r\nalong the rough shore line, keeping at least ankle deep in the water.\r\nRounding a small, wooded point, she came to an overhanging bough upon\r\nwhich she climbed.\r\n\r\nHere she broke two or three small branches and sped on into the next\r\ntree and the next, throwing herself from limb to limb and breaking\r\nsmall branches in her flight. Finally she broke a very small branch and\r\nleaped into a densely foliaged tree without so much as crushing a leaf.\r\nAnd here she ensconced herself from sight.\r\n\r\nHer trap was laid. She clung to a limb as silent and watchful as any\r\nanimal of prey, her long club between her young body and the bark on\r\nwhich she lay.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed while Nimba’s dark eyes kept constant watch through\r\nthe green leaves that formed her mask. Abruptly, as she watched, a\r\nyoung man stepped out and stood beneath her tree. Strong and straight\r\nwas he. His eyes were bright and the hair on his face was short and\r\nsoft. Not a leaf rustled as Nimba watched with growing interest. Below\r\nher the man stood quietly scenting the air.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a twig snapped, and the young man turned like a flash, only\r\nto receive Oomba’s mighty club full on the head. So silently had Oomba\r\napproached that the listening Nimba had not detected the slightest\r\nsound. Now he stood looking down at his victim and contemptuously\r\nturning the bleeding head from side to side with his foot, quite\r\nunconscious of any lurking danger.\r\n\r\nClinging only by her feet from the bough upon which she had been lying,\r\nNimba reached down and swung her club with vicious force upon the side\r\nof Oomba’s head. Beside his own victim he fell, while Nimba dropped\r\nlightly to the ground, turning in the air like a cat and landing upon\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nQuickly she dragged Oomba to one side, where two rocks abutted, and\r\nwedged his head vicelike between them. Then she beat it with her club\r\nuntil it had no shape at all and the leaves and little green things\r\nnearby were spattered with blood. There was no doubt about it: Oomba\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat satisfaction showed on Nimba’s face when her bloody task was done.\r\n\r\nShe washed the blood from her body in the lake and returned to examine\r\nthe young man who had first been struck down. Apparently satisfied\r\nwith his condition, she picked him up and, trailing her bloody club,\r\nreturned to her great rock at the head of the lake. Here she found the\r\ncreeper where Oomba had left it and experienced little difficulty in\r\nclimbing down to the privacy of her cave with the senseless man under\r\none arm.\r\n\r\nTwo trips she made for water, which was carried in a gourd and stored\r\nin a hollow in the cave floor. This done, Nimba washed the young man’s\r\nface, wet his hair and propped him in a corner to recover his senses.\r\n\r\nHer work of mercy finished, Nimba turned her attention to the animal\r\nwhich she had killed earlier in the day. Dragging it from its corner,\r\nshe placed both feet upon the body while she tore off a leg with one\r\nfurious wrench. As the sun was setting and the deep purple of the hills\r\nbecame bordered with gold, Nimba commenced the one meal of the day to\r\nwhich she was accustomed. It would soon be time to sleep.\r\n\r\nAlmost as the last shaft of sunlight shot over the distant hills\r\nconsciousness returned to the young man as he sat propped in the corner\r\nof the cave. Slowly he looked about him. He rose to his feet and walked\r\nto the edge of the cave, where he gazed down at the lake and examined\r\nthe dangling creeper down which he had been carried.\r\n\r\nFinally the young man approached Nimba, who had stopped eating and was\r\nsilently watching him, her mouth bloody from her raw repast. He dragged\r\nthe animal from her side and shoved her into a corner, where a jagged\r\nstone cut her shoulder, causing the blood to flow. Having eaten his\r\nfill, the man lay down to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe great moon rose and silvered the sleeping lake. A night-bird\r\nscreeched as it swept by the entrance to the cave and Nimba crept from\r\nher corner. Still bleeding, she stretched herself beside the sleeping\r\nman. Her body touched his and some blood from her shoulder mingled with\r\nhis in a tiny pool.\r\n\r\nBelow them, in the water, a reptile splashed its way among the reeds.\r\nNimba and her master slept.\r\n\r\nNimba had taken her mate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _What Comes After Death?_\r\n\r\n   _An Anonymous Author Gives a\r\n    Startling Answer in_\r\n\r\n                                 _The_\r\n                               YOUNG MAN\r\n                                 _who_\r\n                               WANTED TO\r\n                                  DIE\r\n\r\n                              _By ? ? ?_\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FIRST EPISODE.\r\n\r\nIn a mean, miserable, two-dollar-a-week bedroom in a Chicago\r\nlodging-house a young man was calmly and deliberately preparing to kill\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe possessed youth, health, affluence and comeliness--and yet he was\r\npreparing to kill himself. Calmly and deliberately. In the shabby room\r\nof a shabby hovel.\r\n\r\nWith a penknife, he was ripping the bedclothes to ribbons and wedging\r\nthem into chinks and crannies. At last satisfied that the room was as\r\nnear gas-tight as he could make it, he stripped to his underclothing\r\nand sat down at the battered bureau and began to write:\r\n\r\n “_As soon as my dead body is found the newspapers will want to know\r\n why I did it. I’ll tell them. And they may scarehead it as much as\r\n they like. I don’t care. I’ve destroyed every clue to my identity, and\r\n though I am wealthy enough to be pointed to and stared at, there is\r\n not one in this vast city whom I know, not one who cares whether I am\r\n alive tomorrow morning, or dead._\r\n\r\n “_A love motive? Yes. But there is also something else--something\r\n equally potent to me, however weak and flimsy it may appear to others.\r\n I loved and do still love a girl whom I have known from childhood, but\r\n always there has been this thing that stood between us, and which is\r\n chiefly accountable for what I am about to do. It is not drink--nor\r\n gambling, nor hereditary disease._\r\n\r\n “_It is a Curiosity. An awful, overwhelming, unconquerable Curiosity.\r\n As far back as I can remember, I’ve had a terrible desire to know\r\n what follows death. As I grew up, this craving increased until it\r\n was a positive mania. I devoured every book on theosophy and kindred\r\n subjects I could lay hands on; I attended meetings of psychic\r\n societies; at college my avidity for psychology was remarked by\r\n everybody. At length I had reached the point where I yearned to tear\r\n aside the black veil of death and discover her secret. Why wait? I\r\n asked myself. Since you are bound to go some day, why not go now?_\r\n\r\n “_One day I half-playfully voiced some such sentiment to her. It led\r\n to a dispute, which led to a violent quarrel; and that night she left\r\n the town where we both lived._\r\n\r\n “_I traced her as far as Chicago, and here I have lost her. For three\r\n years now I have searched the city for her, but not a trace have I\r\n found. And so I have given it up. It is hopeless. I shall never see\r\n her again._\r\n\r\n “_Like myself, she is alone in the world, but, unlike me, she is\r\n very poor. And somewhere in this great, monstrous city she is living\r\n even as I write these words--perhaps miles away--perhaps in the next\r\n block--perhaps ... God alone knows, and God protect her!_”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, put down his pencil, and placed his hand before his eyes.\r\nThus he sat for several minutes. The yellow gas flames flickered\r\nweirdly at either side of the shoddy bureau; the clangor of a distant\r\nstreet car reached him faintly; a motor-truck rumbled heavily in the\r\nstreet below; a bickering couple jawed and wrangled ceaselessly in the\r\nnext room.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile he picked up the pencil and went on:\r\n\r\n “_Well anyway, I’m going to gratify that Curiosity. In a few hours I\r\n shall be in an unknown country I have always longed to explore. I’ve\r\n an idea I’ll find a happiness there I have never known on this earth._\r\n\r\n “_In any event, I shall leave some good front page stuff for the\r\n newspapers. It ought to make an interesting story: ‘Rich young man,\r\n seeking his lost sweetheart in the great city, gives way to despair\r\n and kills himself.’ If the girl is found next door, without money to\r\n buy food or pay her room rent--_”\r\n\r\nHe arose abruptly with a sharp curse, and tore up what he had written.\r\nThen he turned off both gas jets, then turned them on full, and then\r\nlay down upon the cot in a corner of the room....\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps some twenty minutes before his body began to twitch\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\n“Lily May!” he murmured huskily. Then more hoarsely still, “Lily\r\nMay--forgive--Lily May!”\r\n\r\n... His body was writhing and twisting horribly now. His hands were\r\nclutching at the air, at his clothing, at the mattress; his legs were\r\ncontracting and relaxing spasmodically. His face turned purple; he\r\nchoked and gasped.\r\n\r\n“Lily May!” he cried in a stifling whisper, and attempted to lift his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nBut he could not, and his lips ceased moving and his head fell back,\r\nand he lay very still.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SECOND EPISODE.\r\n\r\nWhen the deadly gas fumes reached the youth on the cot he turned over\r\non his back, threw his arms out, and breathed long and deeply of the\r\npoisoned air.\r\n\r\nHis head throbbed and pounded; his heart pumped madly; his eyes started\r\nfrom their sockets. Yet still he lay with outstretched arms, inhaling\r\nevenly and steadily.\r\n\r\nThen everything within him seemed to warp and become distorted and\r\naskew. His veins tied themselves in knots. His blood choked and\r\nclogged. An awful weight crushed and crunched his breast.\r\n\r\nBut he set his teeth and clenched his fists, and continued to gulp in\r\nthe murderous air.\r\n\r\nThen he felt himself dropping, gently, gently--down, down, down--as\r\nthough invisible hands were lowering him into some bottomless, pitch\r\nblack cavern.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there burst upon his vision a dazzling golden light, and\r\nfar above him he saw a blazing throne, sparkling and flashing with a\r\nstrange brilliancy, and on the throne a girl, her hair undone, her body\r\nclothed in a virginal robe. And she gazed down upon him with eyes full\r\nof sadness and reproach. And he tried to call out to her, and tried to\r\nlift his arms to her....\r\n\r\nAnd the fiendish darkness swept all away and closed in upon him and\r\ncrushed him, and he knew no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THIRD EPISODE.\r\n\r\nEons of time had passed.\r\n\r\nAll was impenetrable blackness. With incredible velocity, he was\r\nwhizzing through infinite space. Nothing supported him; nothing touched\r\nhim. Some unseen, unfelt, unthinkable Force was hurling him outward\r\ninto a Stygian, unbounded void.\r\n\r\nThen, so gradually that it was scarcely perceptible, the blackness\r\nwas dyed a pallid, ghastly hue. And with a shocking suddenness it\r\nbecame alive with a horrible larvae. Bloodless and transparent things,\r\nthey seemed, filling the air with a swarming, wriggling magnitude of\r\nloathsome life. And he was a part of this!\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand; and though he felt no touch, he saw the squirming\r\nmass of worms pass through his flesh as though nothing were there. And\r\nhe knew his body swarmed with them as though it were decayed cheese,\r\nand an unspeakable, revolting nausea surged through him.\r\n\r\nThen the paleness vanished, and the larvae with it, and he was still\r\nshooting through the horrible darkness.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother eon had passed.\r\n\r\nNor had his terrible flight abated. Outward, through unlighted\r\ninfinitude, he swept untiringly. Unearthly sounds now filled the\r\nair--voices screaming in agony, cries and moans as of tortured souls,\r\ninsane laughter and maniacal shrieks. Anon, with a howl and a hiss,\r\nsome shrieking air dragon would roar past him. And, all around, he\r\ncould hear the bellow and screech of monsters of the air in terrible\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nThen all turned to an ocean of living blood; and great crimson bellows\r\nbelched over him, wave upon horrid wave. And the frightful aerial\r\nmammals, invisible a moment before, were now seen leaping and plunging\r\nthrough that scarlet sea.\r\n\r\nUnder him and over him they ducked and bounded--gigantic, green-hued\r\nmonsters extravagantly hideous. Now and again one would dart for him,\r\nmouth distended. But the next second he would be far away, with the\r\nghastly creature in hopeless pursuit.\r\n\r\nSlowly the liquid redness merged into a shimmering rainbow of vivid\r\ncolors. Yellow and green, and purple and blue and orange, streaked\r\nthe air with a prismatic glory, glittering and scintillating with a\r\nmarvelous beauty.\r\n\r\nThen, with a terrific suddenness, like a noiseless thunderclap, the\r\nblackness rushed in and blotted out the dazzling iridescence, and\r\ncloaked all in Cimmerian darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOURTH EPISODE.\r\n\r\nAnother eon.\r\n\r\nSo far away it seemed a distant star, the lone traveler through the\r\ninfinite Void discerned a dull red glow. Larger and larger it grew as\r\nhe soared toward it with lightning velocity.\r\n\r\nAnd now it seemed a great mass of flameless fire, shedding its cold\r\nrays for millions of miles. With every second it grew in size until it\r\nwas come to inconceivable proportion. And then it seemed to shrivel up,\r\nand turn ashen and wrinkled, and become as a dead and crumbling sun.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the husk burst open, and the wayfarer described, dimly at\r\nfirst, what seemed the outermost rim of some gorgeous, primeval world.\r\n\r\nAwhile it was as though he were watching it from afar off; but he\r\ntraversed thousands of leagues in as many seconds, and swiftly it took\r\ndefinite shape as he flew nearer and yet nearer.\r\n\r\nAnd then his journey through illimitable space was at an end, and he\r\nhad alighted upon this unknown world, and was wandering through a dense\r\njungle of some marvelous fungus that attained a wondrous height.\r\n\r\nSeemingly without his own volition, he at length found himself lying on\r\na verdant mound overlooking a vast tropical morass that reached off on\r\nall sides into endless vista.\r\n\r\nAnd while he lay there he witnessed in that untracked wilderness a\r\ndiabolical spectacle appalling as hell itself!\r\n\r\nGrisly, indescribable Things--satyrs and ogres and demons and\r\nfiends--appeared in countless numbers, and held orgies that were\r\nMadness intensified. Now they were reveling and cavorting in wanton\r\nabandon; anon battling among themselves in murderous ferocity.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he viewed a sight still more horrible. Off to the right,\r\nhe saw a monstrous snake’s head, as huge as the body of a hippopotamus,\r\nrise up from the swamp and gaze on ravenously at the riotous revel.\r\n\r\nAn instant later the licentious carousal was become wildest terror. The\r\nforest was alive with frightful reptiles--gigantic, stupendous things\r\nthat passed the extent of all imagination. Down they swooped upon their\r\nterrified prey, their enormous, slippery bodies undulating in great\r\nwrithing leaps.\r\n\r\nThe horde of unearthly Things, disporting in hellish debauchery a\r\nmoment before, were swiftly swallowed up by the serpents. Left in\r\npossession of the swamp, they flopped about venomously for a time,\r\ndemolishing and laying waste all about them.\r\n\r\nThey then fell upon one another in unspeakable combat, wriggling and\r\nsquirming slimily together, their repulsive, green-black lengths\r\nintertwined like enormous angle worms. And they killed and devoured\r\neach other, until at last there was left but one hideous, swollen\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nIt leaped and dashed about, lashing its great tail furiously, tearing\r\ndown giant trees as though they were weeds. And as the young man\r\nwatched, the incredible thing seemed to swell larger and larger. And\r\nthen he saw it stop suddenly in its Brobdingnagian gambol and rigidly\r\npoise its hideous head. And he looked straight into its horrifying eyes!\r\n\r\nThey were fixed steadily upon him. But a moment it staid thus; then its\r\nhead dropped, and he saw its mammoth body undulating swiftly toward him\r\nthrough the swamp.\r\n\r\nHe strove to cry out, but could utter no sound. He tried to move, but\r\nhis body was as lead.\r\n\r\nOn came the thing with frightful rapidity; parts of its writhing length\r\nnow sinking in the quagmire, now towering high above it. Now he could\r\nsee that massive head swinging from side to side. Now only a dark,\r\nslimy greenish mass, describing an arch above the swamp, showed its\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nNow it was close upon him. Its vast head swooped up a scant distance\r\naway. Its fulsome eyes blazed upon him with a furious fire. Its great\r\ndrooping jaws swung open. They bristled with venomous fangs.\r\n\r\nThe monster gathered itself in a dozen gigantic coils and lept through\r\nthe air--\r\n\r\n“GOD!” he shrieked.\r\n\r\n“There, there,” soothed a tender voice. “Don’t excite yourself. You’ll\r\nbe all right presently. Just remain quiet, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nA cool hand was laid gently upon his brow. He looked up at the young\r\nnurse who sat beside his cot.\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, he stared for quite a long time at her face,\r\nuntil her cheeks were as crimson as the ribbon at her throat. When at\r\nlength he spoke, he was half laughing, half sobbing, and the syntax of\r\nhis utterance would scarcely have delighted a professor of English at\r\nHarvard University.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve been, girl,” said he. “Got a round trip ticket. But never,\r\nnever again. What’d you run away for? Yep, I’ve had my fill; no more\r\nmetaphysics. _Phew!_ Such reptiles! Big as this room, some of ’em.\r\nI looked three years, and it ran me crazy. _Ugh!_ those snakes and\r\nlizards. Hired detectives, too, but it was no use. And I thought it was\r\nall sunshine and flowers and sweet music. You won’t run away again,\r\nwill you? Could you get me a little brandy, Lily May? I’m feeling a bit\r\nfaint.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LAST EPISODE.\r\n\r\nThe young man made a mistake about the newspapers. One inch was all\r\nhe got, tucked snugly between a patent medicine advertisement and the\r\nnotice of a sheriff’s sale. It read:\r\n\r\n “An unidentified youth attempted to take his life in a North Side\r\n rooming-house last night by inhaling gas. The landlady smelled the\r\n odor of gas and called the police. Miss Lily May Kettering, a nurse\r\n at the National Emergency Hospital, who seems to know the young man,\r\n although refusing to divulge his identity, reports that he is on the\r\n road to recovery.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _There’s an Eerie Thrill in_\r\n\r\n                          _The_ Scarlet Night\r\n\r\n                         _By_ WILLIAM SANFORD\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Langley was in love with my wife.\r\n\r\nThis had been very evident to me for many weeks. Also it was most\r\nevident to me that his love was entirely reciprocated.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was a young and handsome fellow, who bore the reputation of\r\nbeing more or less unscrupulous. An unpleasant story had followed him\r\nfrom another city--the story of the drowning of a young girl. Although\r\nthe coroner’s verdict had been that of accidental drowning, there were\r\nthose, it was said, who thought that the doctor knew much more of the\r\nmatter than had been brought to light, and rumor had it that he had\r\nleft the place because he was no longer popular there.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had a pleasing personality, however, and a way with him\r\nthat had the effect of disarming any prejudice against him. He was,\r\nin brief, a ladies’ man, possessing all of the little attentions and\r\nflatteries so dear to the heart of women. And he gave them all with a\r\nsubtle manner of sincerity that made them doubly potent.\r\n\r\nThe doctor’s practice was fairly large, and he had also succeeded in\r\nhaving himself appointed local medical examiner for our town. He was\r\ndeeply interested in his chosen profession, and still fascinated by the\r\ndissecting-room. He owned a handsome touring-car with which, as I knew,\r\nmy wife was very familiar.\r\n\r\nMy wife was twenty-five--fifteen years my junior--pretty and with much\r\ncharm of manner, yet possessed of a certain hardness of nature and\r\nlack of sympathy for the suffering of others, unusual in a young woman\r\nof good breeding. She came of excellent family, was well educated and\r\nalways had associated with good people.\r\n\r\nI had been somewhat addicted to strong drink before we were married,\r\nbut had managed to keep it from her to a certain extent. She knew that\r\nI drank, but thought that it was no more than many men do at their\r\nclubs. Of my several wild sprees out of town she had never heard.\r\n\r\nWe had been married two years when Dr. Langley took up his practice in\r\nour town, and from the moment he made a professional call on my wife,\r\nfor some minor ailment, they had become intensely interested in each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMy drinking habits had increased, rather than diminished, since my\r\nmarriage, and I no longer made any effort to keep occasional lurid fits\r\nof intoxication from her. My love for liquor became as much a part of\r\nmy life as food or sleep. My position as assistant manager in a large\r\nwholesale house was fairly secure, however, and one not easy to fill,\r\nwhich perhaps accounted for the firm still holding me.\r\n\r\nOne cold, bleak evening in November, while I was playing cards at my\r\nclub--and, thanks to the rum-runners who thrived in our town, drinking\r\nwhisky--I heard a strangely-familiar voice call my name in greeting,\r\nand, looking up, I was overjoyed to behold an old friend of bygone\r\ndays, whom I had not seen in several years. He had dropped off on his\r\nway to another city.\r\n\r\nThe time was ripe for a celebration in honor of our meeting. My friend\r\nproduced a quart flask of whisky from his suitcase, saying that it was\r\nthe duplicate of one he had already sampled, and spoke to me of its\r\nage, strength, fine quality, and the high price he had been obliged to\r\npay for it. Thereupon he presented it to me. I thanked him heartily\r\nand opened the flask, and we all drank a couple of rounds from it. All\r\nof that day, and the day previous, I had been drinking more or less\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nCards were resumed and we played until after midnight, when, with many\r\na handshake, I bade good-by to my friend, who was obliged to catch a\r\ntrain to reach his destination the following noon. The card game being\r\nbroken up, we had a farewell round of drinks, and I stumbled out into\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThe cool air soon revived my somewhat befuddled brain. Also, I was\r\nsoon shaking with the cold. Remembering the generous sized flask of\r\nwhisky in my pocket, the gift of my friend, I uncorked it and took a\r\nlong drink, rejoicing in the fact that the bottle was still almost\r\ntwo-thirds full.\r\n\r\nReaching home, I went at once to my bedroom. My wife was seated in a\r\nchair by the window in her dressing-gown. As I entered, she rose and,\r\nwithout any preliminaries of speech, she asked that I at once give her\r\na divorce so that she might marry Dr. Langley. She said there was no\r\nreason why I should not do this, since I might then marry some woman\r\nwho cared for me, and that she would be happy with the man she had\r\nlearned to love.\r\n\r\nThe abruptness of her request, together with the cold, matter-of-fact\r\nway in which she put it dumfounded me, but, hastily regaining my\r\ncomposure, I flatly refused any such action, told my wife that she must\r\nremain true to her marriage vows, and that nothing would ever induce me\r\nto give her the divorce she wanted. Furthermore, I told her that the\r\ndoctor was a scoundrel--that many people believed he had murdered a\r\ngirl before coming to our town.\r\n\r\nAt this, my wife became livid with fury, accused me of deliberately\r\nbesmirching the doctor’s character because of jealousy, and declared\r\nshe would never live with me again.\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, she seemed much changed. She was very agreeable,\r\neven tender, to me. We walked about the little garden of our home,\r\nas we had often done in the early days of our marriage, and I felt\r\nconfident that she had decided to put the doctor out of her mind and\r\nallow our married life to go on as usual.\r\n\r\nWe chatted pleasantly together at the dinner table that evening, and as\r\nusual I drank a cup of strong coffee after the meal.\r\n\r\nA few moments later a heavy drowsiness came over me and I knew no\r\nmore....\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI awoke with a feeling of suffocation--as if a thousand tons of weight\r\nwere resting on my chest.\r\n\r\nI gasped for breath. I was suffering torture. All about me was\r\nblackness--impenetrable blackness. I moved my hands and encountered\r\nboards, above and on every side. Gradually, to my numbed senses, the\r\nhorrible realization came to me, and the cold sweat started out on my\r\nbody--_I had been buried alive!_\r\n\r\nThe terrible realization had a tendency to clear my mind somewhat, in\r\nspite of the difficulty I encountered in breathing. I saw it all now.\r\nMy wife had given me some powerful drug in my coffee, a drug obtained\r\nfrom the doctor. They had planned and plotted the thing in case I\r\nrefused to consent to a divorce.\r\n\r\nThey probably had known I was still alive when I was buried. The\r\ndoctor, as medical examiner, had filed some fictitious report of death\r\nfrom natural causes, and they had contrived to have a hasty funeral.\r\nHow I had managed to breathe for so long in the coffin, while under the\r\npower of the drug, I did not know. Now that I was fully conscious again\r\nI felt myself stifling.\r\n\r\nNo power of imagination can picture the horror and torture of mind that\r\nmy terrible predicament forced upon me. I must die a slow, terrible\r\ndeath, while those who were responsible for the hellish crime enjoyed\r\nthemselves and went unpunished. The minutes seemed to drag into hours,\r\nas I lay there struggling for breath.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, out of the horrible black stillness, I heard a noise\r\nabove me. Listening, with every racked nerve on edge, I heard it\r\ncome nearer--nearer. At first I could not make it out--could not\r\nunderstand--and then, suddenly, the truth dawned upon me with a\r\nhorrible intensity: _The body snatchers were after me for the\r\ndissecting-room!_\r\n\r\nI tried to cry out, but was unable to make a sound, because of my\r\nstifling condition. They reached the coffin, and I heard the shovel\r\nscraping against it. Then I felt myself being slowly lifted upward, and\r\nthe coffin was dumped on the ground.\r\n\r\nNow I heard a voice, and my blood ran cold, _for it was the voice of\r\nDr. Langley_.\r\n\r\n“The drug was an Oriental one,” he was saying. “It causes a semblance\r\nof death that lasts a long time, but he probably died a few minutes\r\nafter he was buried. I am anxious to dissect to see what effect such a\r\ndrug has on the human body!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, with a terrible shock, I heard the voice of my wife:\r\n\r\n“I don’t care. Do as you wish. I hated him from the moment he refused\r\nto give me a divorce. I could even watch you cut up his body!”\r\n\r\nI struggled to rise in the coffin, gasping for the breath of life, and\r\nthen the lid was pried off, and, summoning all my dying strength, I\r\nrose to my feet, waving my arms wildly back and forth and inhaling a\r\ngreat breath of life-giving night air.\r\n\r\nThe doctor let the shovel fall to the ground without a word, and\r\nstaggered back and sank to his knees, while my wife gave a hideous\r\nscream of terror. Then she snatched a knife from his kit of dissecting\r\ninstruments and drew the razor-sharp blade across her throat. She then\r\nthrew herself upon the prostrate doctor, her blood drenching his body.\r\n\r\nMy senses reeling, I staggered forward, tripped over my coffin and fell\r\nswooning to the ground.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNone believe my story. Neither will you. I have told it to them all,\r\nbut they will not believe it.\r\n\r\nI am in a hospital, where they tell me I have been for several days.\r\nIt is a prison hospital, where guards in uniform patrol the corridors,\r\nlest even the sick try to escape.\r\n\r\nThey ask me if I cannot remember that I came home that night from the\r\nclub in a blind frenzy of drink and found my wife and Dr. Langley\r\ntogether. They tell me that I choked him with such ferocity and\r\nstrength that my fingers broke into the flesh of his neck. They tell me\r\nthat my wife, screaming with terror, tried to escape, and that, just as\r\nthe people in the adjoining apartment burst into the room, I seized a\r\nrazor from the bureau and slashed her throat from ear to ear, and threw\r\nher body, with the blood streaming from the wound, across that of the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nAre they going to hang me for this double crime that I did not commit?\r\n\r\nThey will not believe my story. Yet every detail of it is as clear to\r\nme as the stars that shine in the heavens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Read of the Frightful Thing\r\n  That Came from_\r\n\r\n                       _The_\r\n                         Extraordinary\r\n                            Experiment _of_\r\n                               Dr. Calgroni\r\n\r\n              _By_ Joseph Faus and James Bennett Wooding\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is much concerning the queer Dr. Calgroni that I can not give to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that I had never been inside his house until\r\nafter I beheld him frantically emerge from its big front door, that\r\nrainy night, his wizened face as white as death, and, scantily-clad,\r\nrush headlong for the depot.\r\n\r\nThat he was a surgeon of extraordinary ability I readily acknowledge.\r\nBut Belleville was the last place where one would expect to find a man\r\nof such surgical skill, and, most undoubtedly, the last place one would\r\nchoose for the scene of the startling events brought about as a result\r\nof the doctor’s purchase of the ape “Horace” from Barber’s World-famous\r\n3-Ring Show.\r\n\r\nHad the doctor merely put up at the hotel I might have believed him,\r\nlike myself, merely summering at Belleville. For it was a restful\r\nhamlet, situated in a mountainous valley, something like a day’s run\r\nfrom New York. But his renting of the Thornsdale place aroused latent\r\nsuspicions in my mind, probably instilled there by that strange article\r\nI had read in _The Surgical Monthly_.\r\n\r\nLarge enough for a hotel or boarding-house, but out-of-the-way\r\nlocated--also because of the enormous rent demanded by its heirs--the\r\nThornsdale place had stood vacant since the last of the Thornsdale line\r\nhad died ten years before. Its doors had been closed and padlocked, and\r\nits windows barricaded.\r\n\r\nIt had been the finest residence in the old town in its day, but was\r\nnow regarded as a sort of historic oddity. On the whole, it afforded a\r\nformidable appearance, crouching behind its great elms, looming huge\r\nand weather-beaten, with its board-shuttered and frowning windows.\r\nBut just the sort of place the eccentric Dr. Calgroni could work in,\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\nI saw the peculiar doctor one morning as I was leaving the small post\r\noffice. It was just after train time, and many of the villagers were\r\nloitering about the place, among them a young man named Jason Murdock.\r\n\r\nMurdock was of that type one always hears of in a small community--the\r\nvillage “devil.” He came of a good family, and had plenty of money and\r\nall that: but had succeeded, despite rich heritage-blood, in igniting\r\nmore fire and brimstone than all five of the village preachers had in\r\ntheir imagination conceived. He was coarsely good-looking, and big and\r\nhusky.\r\n\r\nAristocratic hoodlum though he was, all rather secretly admired the\r\nfellow, probably because he injected “pep” into the lazy old town.\r\n\r\nI beheld Jason Murdock pointing to a shriveled-up figure of a little\r\nman, stooped of shoulder.\r\n\r\n“There he goes--that Dr. Can-groanee, who’s movin’ into the Thornsdale\r\nplace. I wonder if there’s any good liquor in his cellar? That old\r\nThornsdale dump has a good wine cellar.”\r\n\r\nDr. Calgroni paid not the slightest attention to Jason’s insolent\r\nbabble, but walked hurriedly along, his clean-shaven, dried-up\r\ncountenance turning neither to the right nor left.\r\n\r\n“Who is that man?” I asked the postmaster, who had now come to the door\r\nfor air.\r\n\r\n“I dunno, excepting his mail is addressed Dr.--I’ll have to spell\r\nit--C-A-L-G-R-O-N-I--and it is mostly foreign, out of Vienna, forwarded\r\nhere from New York.”\r\n\r\n“Sort of a man of mystery, eh?” I hazarded.\r\n\r\n“I should say he’s sort of a fool for rentin’ that old Thornsdale\r\nrat-trap, for God-knows-what, that’s stood vacant these ten years.”\r\n\r\nI nodded and left in the direction taken by the doctor.\r\n\r\nHere was an element of mystery; for I alone, of all the villagers, knew\r\nthat this eminent surgeon’s presence in Belleville boded ill.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI soon caught sight of the doctor. For a man of his age and physique,\r\nhis gait was exceedingly fast--as though propelled by a nervous dynamo.\r\n\r\nStretching my legs, I kept a safe distance between him and myself,\r\nuntil he swung open the tall wooden gate and quickly vanished through\r\nthe wilderness of tall bushes and low trees into the Thornsdale house.\r\nI halted safe from observation and lighted my pipe.\r\n\r\nLeaning against a tree there, I ran over in my mind the odd\r\nsignificance of that remarkable article I had recently read in the\r\nstaid and ever-authentic _Surgical Monthly_.\r\n\r\nThis Dr. Calgroni, it appeared, had stated to the interviewer that he\r\nwas here from Austria on a vacation--and to feel out the opinions of\r\nAmerican surgeons anent his new theory. One _Herr_ von Meine, a noted\r\nsurgeon of Vienna, he added with some asperity, had scoffed at the\r\nabsurdity and unorthodox idea of the unprecedented theory advanced by\r\nhim, and had declared that his, Calgroni’s, operation was extremely\r\nimpossible, not to say foolish--that it would never be a success.\r\n\r\nDr. Calgroni claimed that he could prolong a human life indefinitely by\r\nthe insertion of a live thigh gland from a young quadrumanous mammal,\r\nsuch as the _Pithecoid_.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion and argument had been provoked throughout the entire\r\nmedical world by the famous doctor’s theory, and consensus was that he\r\nwas an impracticable theorist gone mad.\r\n\r\nAnd now here was Dr. Calgroni, living in the quiet little town of\r\nBelleville, where none was aware of his sensational hypothesis, renting\r\nthis immense old ramshackle place, and his remarkable intent known to\r\nno one but himself.\r\n\r\nI had taken a seat on a tree stump, in front of the gate, which had a\r\nring stapled to it, used in former days as a hitching-post. Time hung\r\nheavily upon me in Belleville, but this new element of mystery promised\r\nsome possible interest and excitement.\r\n\r\nHaving sat there until my pipe was empty and cold, I was aroused by\r\nthe noise of the gate opening behind me, followed by the _tap-tap_ of\r\na hammer. I turned.\r\n\r\nThere stood the doctor in his shirt sleeves, tacking a sign to the gate\r\npost. Crudely painted in black on white cardboard I read:\r\n\r\n                      _POSITIVELY NO ADMITTANCE!_\r\n\r\n                      _Anyone entering here does\r\n                         so at his own risk._\r\n\r\n                                    _T. Calgroni._\r\n\r\nWithout even casting a glance my way, the doctor closed the gate behind\r\nhim and seemed about to depart up the weed-grown gravel walk, when,\r\nglancing down the dusky street, he checked himself.\r\n\r\nMy gaze followed the direction of his eyes. A wagon was approaching. It\r\ndrew up at the stump and halted. Loaded with big boxes, the mules were\r\nsweating after the pull. Their surly-faced driver stopped twenty feet\r\naway and turned to the doctor:\r\n\r\n“I know I’m late,” I overheard him grumble, “but I handled the boxes\r\ncarefully as you said. Shall I drive in?”\r\n\r\n“You’d better,” returned Calgroni in crisp English, still not noticing\r\nme. “And remember, if there’s a thing broken not a cent do you get.”\r\nAnd he wheeled up the path.\r\n\r\n“Dam’ him!” swore the teamster, turning to me. “Did you ever see such\r\nan old crab?”\r\n\r\n“Glass inside the boxes?” I suggested.\r\n\r\nThe fellow looked at me suspiciously then his lips contracted like a\r\nvise and he turned to his mules. I watched him drive through the wagon\r\ngate, and on up through the moss-covered trees to the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\nThe next morning I arose early, with the intention of strolling past\r\nthe old Thornsdale place. I found Main Street lifeless, except for two\r\nmen busily engaged in posting up the glaring announcement of the coming\r\nof:\r\n\r\n                        “BARBER’S WORLD-FAMOUS\r\n                             3-RING SHOW”\r\n\r\nPausing, I watched them swab the long multi-hued strips of paper with\r\ntheir paste brush and sling them upon the billboard. A small crowd of\r\nbig-eyed youngsters and loafers gradually congregated about the busy\r\ncircus advance men.\r\n\r\nThe most glaring and conspicuous poster represented two gorillas\r\npeering angrily out from behind the bars of their cage. Beneath it was\r\nlithographed in huge, red letters:\r\n\r\n                          “MIMMIE AND HORACE\r\n                         ONLY WILD GORILLAS IN\r\n                              CAPTIVITY!”\r\n\r\nI turned to leave--and, momentarily startled, faced what seemed to\r\nbe one of the gorillas at large! Only it wore clothes. Gazing at the\r\nposter with a look of blank curiosity, was a man, short in stature,\r\nimmense of shoulder and deep of chest, his hair thatching his forehead\r\nalmost to his bushy eyebrows. He was hideous to look upon. I recognized\r\nhim, though, after an instant, as the village half-wit, known as\r\n“Simple Will.”\r\n\r\nI had seen him before, a poor, weak-minded creature, wandering\r\nhelplessly about the village, pitied, but spurned except when someone\r\nneeded the help of powerful hands and a strong back.\r\n\r\nDrooling and muttering, Will followed the circus men as they started\r\noff.\r\n\r\nI idly strolled down the first street; then, reaching the outskirts\r\nof town, I found myself in the rear of the Thornsdale place. To my\r\nsurprise, I beheld another warning notice similar to the one that Dr.\r\nCalgroni had tacked to his front gate last evening. Not only in one but\r\nmany places, on trees and the high fence, I saw the warning signs of\r\n“No Trespassing.” The doctor himself was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nA week slipped by and nothing happened further than gossip concerning\r\nthe queer doctor. Occasionally Dr. Calgroni, in person, purchased\r\nsupplies and called for his mail. Although I contrived to be near\r\nhim whenever possible, he seldom uttered more than half a dozen\r\nwords--and never to me. Once, though, I thought I caught him peering\r\nsurreptitiously at me in a queer manner.\r\n\r\nObviously, the doctor was his own servant, housekeeper and cook. No one\r\ntook the risk of entering his place--not even the daring Jason Murdock.\r\n\r\nSeveral days before the circus arrived, I noticed what I considered\r\na peculiarly significant happening--Dr. Calgroni walking toward his\r\nabode, with Simple Will tagging, doglike, a few paces behind.\r\n\r\nAt discreet distance, I followed them. Arriving at the Thornsdale\r\nplace, I was surprised to see the doctor close the gate behind him,\r\nleaving Will standing outside. The half-wit stood there until Dr.\r\nCalgroni disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe day before the show came, I saw the doctor clapping Will on the\r\nshoulder and talking to him.\r\n\r\nThat night such a terrible conclusion shaped itself in my mind as to\r\nthe meaning of the singular boxes, the hostile notices, Will’s attitude\r\ntoward the doctor, and the latter’s interest in him, that it kept me\r\nwide awake.\r\n\r\nIn ill humor at myself, I rose at the first appearance of the sun.\r\nRemembering the circus, I strolled over to the tracks to watch it\r\nunload.\r\n\r\nSome villagers had gathered about the few wretched travel-scarred cars\r\nthat made up the second-rate circus train, and particularly in front of\r\nthe car containing the cage of Mimmie and Horace.\r\n\r\nDoctor Calgroni was there, and, at his heels, Simple Will. The doctor\r\nwas talking very earnestly to the trainer.\r\n\r\n“You say Mr. Barber has offered to sell either of these animals,” the\r\ndoctor was saying, as I drew up on the outer fringe of the curious\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n“Yes sir. He will sell one because they fight continually. They have\r\nto be carefully watched, or they might kill each other. You don’t know\r\nwhat ferocious beasts gorillas are--”\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled.\r\n\r\n“I would like to talk to Mr. Barber,” he interposed.\r\n\r\nThe gorilla trainer hesitated, then, pulling shut the sliding doors of\r\nthe animal car:\r\n\r\n“Sure; just follow me,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, at the man’s side, walked to a coach ahead, the combination\r\nticket-and-executive office of the Barber Shows. For an instant, Simple\r\nWill seemed to hesitate, but he didn’t trail Dr. Calgroni--the unseen\r\nthings inside of the gigantic cage nearby seemed to hold his hypnotic\r\nattention. Several big drops of rain splashed upon the cinder-strewn\r\nground. The heavens hung black and dismal; the sun had completely\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nI watched Simple Will. He was ill-at-ease, hovering uneasily about\r\nthe gorillas’ car. The other people nearby paid no attention to the\r\nhalf-wit. Presently the trainer and Dr. Calgroni returned, accompanied\r\nby another man, who was counting a roll of bills.\r\n\r\n“You say,” the latter remarked as they passed me, “that you want\r\n‘Horace’ delivered at once?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the doctor concisely.\r\n\r\n“All right. Hank, call the gang, unload the cage and put Horace in that\r\nred single cage. Dr. Calgroni has relieved us of him!”\r\n\r\nAt this, Simple Will approached the surgeon and touched his sleeve.\r\n\r\n“You buy hairy animal-man?” he mumbled.\r\n\r\nThe doctor laid his blue-veined and thin old hand upon Will’s broad\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Will, and I’m going to give you a job--a job as his valet!” The\r\nshow men exchanged winks, and from the car rolled an empty, iron-barred\r\ncage. Will’s expressionless features twisted into what on his idiot\r\ncountenance registered pleasure.\r\n\r\nDr. Calgroni beckoned to the man whom I had seen deliver the\r\nstrange-appearing boxes that first afternoon.\r\n\r\n“Got your team?”\r\n\r\nThe fellow nodded.\r\n\r\nA scene of bustle had sprung up about me. An excited and larger crowd\r\nof villagers had assembled.\r\n\r\nThe big cage containing Mimmie and Horace was lowered to the track\r\nside. They were two of the finest animals of their type I have ever\r\nlooked upon.\r\n\r\nHorace was transferred to the single cage and its strong door doubly\r\npadlocked upon him. The mule team drew up with the wagon.\r\n\r\n“Here, Will,” said the doctor to the half-wit, “climb into the wagon.\r\nWe’re going before we get wet.” The doctor appeared highly elated.\r\n\r\nSimple Will, who had stood by as if in a stupor, swung his heavy body\r\nup behind the gorilla’s cage.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the wagon drawn out of sight than the heavens seemed to\r\nloosen in wrath. Rain fell in torrents, driving the spectators in a\r\nwild rush for shelter. As I reached the hotel, the water dripping from\r\nmy drenched garments, the storm increased its fury. All that day it\r\nrained--and the next.\r\n\r\nAs I lay on my bed that night and listened to the roar of wind and\r\nrain beating upon the roof and window panes, my mind kept drifting to\r\nthe inmates of Thornsdale place--the queer doctor, Simple Will and his\r\nward, Horace, the gigantic gorilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _III._\r\n\r\nIt was three days later that I learned Dr. Calgroni had wired to New\r\nYork, and on the next morning an exceptionally well-dressed stranger,\r\nwhose goatee, bearing and satchel smacked of a medical man, stepped off\r\nthe train.\r\n\r\nEspying me, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Will you kindly direct me to the Thornsdale place?”\r\n\r\nI told him the best way to reach Dr. Calgroni’s without wading in mud,\r\nand he departed, with a brief “Thank You.”\r\n\r\nThe next night I saw the stranger, ashen of face and decidedly inwardly\r\nshaken, hurriedly purchase a ticket and leave on the 9:45 train for New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nImmediately I sought the telegraph dispatcher.\r\n\r\n“You are aware of the queer actions of Dr. Calgroni--”\r\n\r\n“I should say! He’s a nut.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say as to that, but to whom did he send the message the other\r\nnight?”\r\n\r\n“You won’t let it out I tipped you off?”\r\n\r\nI solemnly held up my right hand.\r\n\r\n“Well,” in a whisper, “he wired a hospital for their best surgical man.”\r\n\r\nSo the assistant had gone back, frightened. And why?\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks later Barber’s World-famous 3-Ring Show gave a return\r\nexhibition at Belleville. That night I wandered toward the Thornsdale\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAgain the clouds had banked for a storm, fitful rays of the moon now\r\nand then shifting through, only to be absorbed in mist.\r\n\r\nDrawing around in front of the old homestead, looming dark behind the\r\ngloom-shadowed trees, I seated myself on the stump hitching-post. I was\r\nglad that in my coat pocket nestled a neat automatic. Why I lingered\r\nthere in front of the quiet old place I do not know. Not a light\r\nglimmered in the house; not a noise issued from its muffled depths.\r\n\r\nThen to my ears came a shriek and to my startled gaze a light flared in\r\nthe house. I could dimly see that a figure appeared at its open door.\r\nIt looked behind it for an instant, then madly bolted toward me.\r\n\r\nUpon the wet gravel came the tread of rapidly-moving feet, and the\r\ngate in front of me swung abruptly back. In the hazy reflected light,\r\nI got one look at Dr. Calgroni who, hat and raincoat in his hands,\r\nthe muscles of his face quivering, his face deathly pale, emerged and\r\nturned, running madly toward town.\r\n\r\nI drew back, automatic in hand, waiting for whatever might follow the\r\ndoctor. Nothing happened. Obeying an impulse, I took out after the\r\nfleeing surgeon. Over soggy soil I followed him, around corners, down\r\nMain Street to the depot. I got there in time to see him swing on the\r\nplatform of the rear coach of the 9:45 train, bound for New York.\r\n\r\nThrobbing with excitement, scarce knowing what I was doing, I made my\r\nway back toward the Thornsdale place. Several blocks away, I caught\r\na glimpse of a broad-shouldered, thick-set disheveled figure in\r\nbreech-clout, running--or, rather, prancing and hopping--toward the\r\ncircus grounds. The automatic in my hand, I followed.\r\n\r\nA block from the circus grounds, under the street lamp, I saw a figure\r\non horseback that I recognized as Jason Murdock, evidently bound for\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThen, snarling, the Thing I had seen hopped out from behind a tree\r\ntrunk, on all fours. Gaining its hind feet, it made a flying leap at\r\nJason, knocking him from his horse. On the ground they rolled, the\r\npowerful Jason helpless in the Thing’s clutch. Its fingers closed\r\nchokingly about the man’s throat.\r\n\r\nI tried to shoot, only to find my gun jammed; tried to shout, and could\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAt that instant the brass band struck up “There’ll Be A Hot Time In The\r\nOld Town Tonight!” As the quick, dancing strains smote the night air,\r\nthe Thing suddenly ceased in the act of strangling Jason, looking\r\nattentively up. There seemed to be a responsive, obedient look on its\r\nhorrible countenance. I could see its wild-eyes and bearded face--God!\r\n_It was Simple Will!_\r\n\r\nBounding first on all fours, then half-upright on his feet, the crazed\r\nidiot was making for the show grounds just as the clouds broke in\r\na downpour. To the rear of the big tent bounded Will, as the crowd\r\nscattered for home.\r\n\r\nAs if familiar with his surrounding, he made for a side-show tent in\r\nfront of which sputtered a gas torch. The crowd, fleeing in the rain,\r\nhad in the confusion failed to see the half-wit and myself on the mad\r\nrun. But several men were following me, as Will tore aside the entrance\r\nflaps.\r\n\r\nInside, poorly-lighted though it was, I could plainly see the cage of\r\nMimmie, the female-gorilla. Her trainer turned at the noise of our\r\nentrance, and hastily reached for his knife-pointed pole--but too\r\nlate. Uttering a cry, piercing and antagonistic, Will flung himself at\r\nMimmie’s cage, who, with an answering cry of battle, reached both her\r\nlong hairy arms through her cage, clawing and tearing at the fiercely\r\nstruggling man on the outside.\r\n\r\nThe trainer rushed in with his prong, thrusting it at Mimmie. For an\r\ninstant she drew back; then several of us quickly pulled Will, bleeding\r\nprofusely, back from the enraged animal, who again lurched forward as\r\nthough recognizing in Will the reincarnation of her mate, Horace.\r\n\r\nFoaming at the mouth, Will sank limply to the floor. From the hue of\r\nthe blood, ebbing from the side of his neck, I saw at a glance that he\r\nwas done for--Mimmie’s claws had severed his jugular vein.\r\n\r\nAmong the men who had helped me thrust the poor fellow out of Mimmie’s\r\nreach, was the sheriff of the county.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” he demanded, grasping my shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Follow me!” I cried.\r\n\r\nA crowd of excited men, headed by the sheriff and myself, made for the\r\nThornsdale place. The light still dimly illuminated the hall through\r\nthe open door.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go in first, sheriff,” I offered. “Have your men surround the\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\nI stole into the hall. A terrible stench greeted me. I found it came\r\nfrom a door opening out into the hall. A feeble light burned within.\r\nAbout me stood several boxes, with the sides torn open, and excelsior\r\nhanging and strewn about them.\r\n\r\nBefore me, completely assembled in every detail, stood what the\r\nboxes had contained--an operating table and all its many surgical\r\naccessories. Out of a long box in the corner sprawled the hairy limbs\r\nof the fast-decaying Horace, the male gorilla.\r\n\r\nTaking a small oil lamp from the stand, I turned to examine the dead\r\nbody; and I noticed a paper, which fell to the floor. A quick look at\r\nthe side of the beast’s head revealed a great gash, rottening at the\r\nedges, through which, it was evident, the brain had been removed.\r\n\r\nI hastily recalled Dr. Calgroni’s theories. Could it be--\r\n\r\nMy eyes chanced to drop to the floor. Holding forth the lamp, I saw\r\nthere was handwriting on the bit of paper.\r\n\r\nI picked it up and read the note, which, even at the last stand,\r\nCalgroni had directed to _me_, Von Meine, chief disparager of his wild\r\ntheories:\r\n\r\n “_Herr Von Meine, of Vienna, you said I could not do it. You berated\r\n me for my endeavors to alleviate the distress of the insane and\r\n feeble-minded. Yet I know now that I have accomplished it, without\r\n killing the subject as you claimed would be the result of such an\r\n operation. That’s why I followed you here, to show you! It was\r\n successful, Von Meine. I could tell by the way his eyes looked into\r\n mine, when he finally came to. But I could see the brain I had\r\n substituted for Will’s atrophied one was too vigorous--that expression\r\n didn’t belong to Simple Will. I am fleeing before he gains his\r\n strength. I admit my fear; for after this operation the former half-wit\r\n will be a dangerous customer, with the too vigorous and ferocious brain\r\n of the Gorilla Horace in his head!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Ten Pallbearers For This Mammoth Woman\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Martha Carmas, of Middle Village, Queensboro, New York, died\r\nof elephantiasis, ten men were required to carry her body from the\r\nhospital to Lutz Church for funeral services. She weighed 710 pounds.\r\nA special coffin of immense size was made for the body. Mrs. Carmas\r\nwas only thirty-three years of age, and, until she contracted the\r\ndreadful elephantiasis, she was not unusually heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Woman Starves Herself To Feed Cats\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a mean neighborhood in New York City dwelt Mary Bosanti, the “Cat\r\nWoman.” The neighbors gave her that name because of her excessive love\r\nfor cats. All the cats in that part of town seemed to be attracted\r\nto her house. Every day she went to the corner grocery and bought\r\nsix quarts of milk, which she carried back to her room. Twenty or\r\nmore cats always tagged at her heels, and when she spoke to them in a\r\nlowered tone they seemed to know what she said. They obeyed her every\r\ncommand. Then, one morning, a neighbor heard groans issuing from the\r\n“Cat Woman’s” room and called the other tenants of the house. They\r\nbroke the door in--and found the “Cat Woman” starving, surrounded by a\r\ngreat swarm of cats and more than 200 empty milk bottles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Here’s a “Creepy” Tale That\r\n  Ends In a Shuddering,\r\n  Breath-taking Way_\r\n\r\n                         _The_ Return _of_\r\n                               Paul Slavsky\r\n\r\n                   _By_ Capt. George Warburton Lewis\r\n\r\n _Author of_ “Trailing the Jungle Man,” “Wine of the Wilderness,” Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Petrograd came Paul Slavsky, with what his Nihilist associates\r\nmight have styled a clean record and no bungled jobs, but what Larry\r\nBrandon classified as a criminal record _de luxe_.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that such a record should bring about Slavsky’s early\r\nacquaintance with Inspector Brandon, of the Central Office and it\r\nfollowed, as day follows dawn, that the Terrorist should become the\r\nobject of the shrewdest surveillance the Chief Inspector could design.\r\n\r\nWhether Paul Slavsky actually discovered, or merely suspected, that\r\nhe was being shadowed, matters little. A notation on an old blotter\r\nshows that he boldly attempted to pave the way for future criminal\r\nenterprises by calling at the Central Office in the role of a\r\npersecuted citizen, who had journeyed here from his native land to\r\nescape the hell which he declared the Russian Secret Police had made\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nIt took three months of intensive investigation to convince Larry\r\nBrandon that Slavsky was all the Secret Police had painted him and\r\nmore, and that the Terrorist had not emigrated to America with even the\r\nremotest intention of reforming. It took the detective three months\r\nmore to satisfy himself beyond all doubt that Slavsky had, marvelously\r\nenough, established an active branch of his old order and was\r\nundoubtedly spreading the doctrine of Gorgias and Fichte under the very\r\nnoses of the Central Office experts. However, the evidence necessary to\r\na conviction was lacking, so nothing could be done.\r\n\r\nA little later the men of the same nationality as the Nihilist, whom\r\nBrandon had used to great advantage on the case, began, one by one, to\r\ndrop quietly out of existence. This was not only mysterious--it was\r\nuncanny. Finally the decomposed bodies of some of these operatives were\r\nfound and unmistakably identified.\r\n\r\nIn each instance _the head had been completely severed from the trunk_.\r\n\r\nRecollecting that the Terrorist order, to which Paul Slavsky had\r\nbelonged, had signalized its outrages by decapitating its victims,\r\nBrandon was enabled to initiate definite plans which, in due course,\r\nculminated in his running his man to earth.\r\n\r\nBut Paul Slavsky never beheld the fatal Chair nor served time. He chose\r\nthe other route. He had elected to live in rebellion against man’s\r\norderly institutions, and in this same unreasoning revolt he resolved\r\nto die. Like most of his ilk, the Terrorist in physical combat was a\r\nhard man, and he really fought a great fight, but he fought it with a\r\nmaster craftsman in the conquering of such as he, and inevitably he\r\nlost, with many of Larry Brandon’s bullets in his great body and only\r\nlife enough left in him to greet--and almost at once to take final\r\nleave of--his favorite sister, Olga, who had arrived in Europe a little\r\nlate as it transpired, to join her brother in his sinister calling.\r\n\r\nOlga Slavsky, years younger than her lamented brother, was as pretty a\r\nlittle specimen of dark-eyed femininity as ever enchanted fastidious\r\nmasculine eye. Yet so is the tigress beautiful.\r\n\r\nStill, that is not quite the idea I wish to convey. If you can think of\r\na woman in repose being as beautiful as a tigress and, in smoldering\r\nhate and loathing as repulsive, as hideous as a preying vampire, then\r\nyou will get nearer my meaning. Olga, like her brother, was a staunch\r\nexponent of the Terrorist doctrine.\r\n\r\nWhat Brandon expected soon came to pass. The strange girl, whom\r\nmen called beautiful and women envied, was promptly elected to her\r\nbrother’s place in what was known in the underworld of unlawful secret\r\norders as the “League.” In this way she immediately crossed swords with\r\nthe man who had ended the career of her brother Paul, and ere long she\r\nbecame aware, through members of the League detailed as spies, that\r\nstill another noted criminologist, Joe Seagraves, was unpleasantly hot\r\non her trail.\r\n\r\nBut Olga was undaunted. For daring and ingenuity, she by far eclipsed\r\nher cunning and resourceful brother, who had blazed the path of her\r\niconoclastic pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nSince little could thus far be proved against Olga, Seagraves believed\r\nthat it might be better to declare a sort of armistice and, if\r\npossible, gradually win her over to the side of law and order. To\r\nthis end, he openly called and laid his ideas before her. She frankly\r\nflouted his implied interest in her well-being, but showed a spirit of\r\ncompromise by offering the crime specialist a cigarette.\r\n\r\nIn such a mood Olga became a docile and purring tiger kitten, only one\r\nnever quite forgot her claws. She was highly superstitious, Seagraves\r\ndiscovered; but then her whole character was so anomalous and so\r\nreplete with unexpectedly outcropping traits and wildly illogical\r\nbeliefs that it was almost to be expected she would believe in ghosts.\r\n\r\nShe clung tenaciously to the belief, so Brandon told Seagraves, that\r\nsome day Paul would _return_ and end the life of the man who--the\r\nTerrorist had told his sister shortly before his death--had done him to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n“Do you still believe, Olga, that Paul is going to come back one day\r\nand carry Brandon away with him into the Unknown?” asked Seagraves.\r\n\r\nOlga’s dark eyes grew suddenly darker as she slowly removed a cigarette\r\nfrom between her too red lips.\r\n\r\n“Not only is he coming,” she answered, “but he is coming _soon_. Only\r\nnight before last I talk with him. I tell him hurry. You see his spirit\r\ncannot rest until his murder is--ah, my very bad English!--avenge’.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a very foolish woman, Olga,” admonished Seagraves. “If you\r\nrefuse to listen to my warning you’re going to find yourself in lots of\r\ntrouble. I want you to understand that.”\r\n\r\nThen the drowsing tigress put out her claws.\r\n\r\n“You threaten me!” she fairly hissed, tossing away her cigarette and\r\nrising. “I am a free woman. You are, after all, like my own people. You\r\nwould make slaves of all who cannot buy their freedom of--of thought\r\nand action.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced about queerly before she concluded:\r\n\r\n“Don’t interest yourself too far. You may be great, but remember--I am\r\nno longer to be despised. You have waited too long. Should I choose,\r\nfor example, I could have shot you where you sit.”\r\n\r\nJoe Seagraves leaped out of his chair, an automatic in his experienced\r\nhand and menacing the mysterious woman steadily.\r\n\r\nBut already the allegorical vampire, which the detective had seen\r\nreflected in Olga’s piercing eyes and heard in her studied but crisp\r\nand stinging words, had spread its skinny wings and flown. Olga was\r\nlaughing in such sincere, or well-feigned, mockery at his alarm that\r\nthe dignified detective momentarily felt abashed.\r\n\r\nHe put his weapon away, nevertheless, only after a searching glance\r\nabout the very ordinary little room in which the extraordinary woman\r\nhad received him. He recalled that the last victim of Olga’s brother,\r\nmutilated, headless and repellent, had been found in this same\r\nneighborhood, if not in this same house.\r\n\r\n“Please--_please_ forgive me,” the strange girl was pleading. “You\r\nsee, I forgot that you are not like--like Brandon. For him there is no\r\nforgiveness. He must perish. But we--you and I--why must we be enemies?”\r\n\r\n“There’s but one reason, Olga,” replied Seagraves seriously, “and that\r\nis a strong one. It is simply the nature of our respective callings.”\r\n\r\n“Then I can only be sorry,” she said in a low voice. “Still, my\r\nprinciples are more--what word?--more sacred than your friendship.”\r\n\r\nAs the woman paused, Seagraves could have taken an oath that he caught\r\nthe sound of whispering voices through a door standing slightly ajar\r\nnot three paces from his elbow. Of a sudden, he stepped forward and\r\nflung the door wide with a resounding _bang_.\r\n\r\nA gray-walled room, quite empty, was all that rewarded his examination.\r\nHe turned and found Olga smiling again.\r\n\r\n“Did you surprise them?” she inquired sweetly.\r\n\r\n“Surprise whom?” demanded the detective.\r\n\r\n“The rats,” she said ingenuously, still smiling.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen but one rat here,” murmured Seagraves in an impersonal tone:\r\n“I see it now. It has wings that fold up like an umbrella. It is called\r\na vampire.”\r\n\r\nOlga smiled on placidly, even after Joe Seagraves had closed the door\r\non her and was gone.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the language of the man who knotted the noose, Olga, as her kind are\r\ncertain to do, came at last to the end of her rope.\r\n\r\nConspiracy, blackmail and extortion were at last brought home to her;\r\nand it chanced that the same eminent crime expert who had hurried the\r\ncareer of her brother to an inglorious finish was likewise destined to\r\nbe the instrument of fate in the undoing of Olga.\r\n\r\nIn time the pursuit narrowed down to the end of a most imperfect day\r\nfor both quarry and hunters. Then all night, as Brandon and Seagraves\r\ngradually drew their web closer and ever closer about the elusive\r\nTerrorist, she tricked them at every angle and turn with the cunning of\r\na fox, and it was not until three sleepless days and nights that the\r\ntwo renowned sleuths effected her capture more than five hundred miles\r\ndistant from the field of her long-continued operations.\r\n\r\n“She’ll be as slippery as an eel,” Brandon warned Seagraves, when they\r\nwere ready to start back with their prisoner. “I’ll never consent to\r\nany Pullman for _her_, even though we ignore the law and handcuff\r\nher to the seat. One of us is going to have to keep his eyes on her\r\nconstantly.”\r\n\r\n“Only one of us could sleep at a time, anyhow,” said Seagraves; “and\r\nsurely we can stand it one more night, don’t you think? Suppose we both\r\nsit it out with her.”\r\n\r\nThey at length did decide to “sit it out” with their prisoner, and with\r\nthat understanding they took her aboard the train.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of entering the train, a telegram was handed to Brandon,\r\nand as soon as the three were comfortably seated in their section the\r\ninspector read it with lips compressed and eyes oddly squinted. Then he\r\nhanded the message to Seagraves, who read:\r\n\r\n “Police record Olga Slavsky arrived. Wanted in three countries for\r\n complicity in murder nine counts. Escaped Russian Secret Police three\r\n times. At present fugitive from justice. Keep close watch on her.\r\n Renfrow, Chief Inspector.”\r\n\r\nSeagraves returned the telegram to Brandon, winking an eye\r\ndisparagingly and smiling at what the Chief Inspector had evidently\r\nconsidered a necessary precaution.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon waned. Early evening found the train three-quarters of an\r\nhour behind time. If this kept up they would not arrive before two in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nOlga sat besides Seagraves facing Brandon.\r\n\r\n“I would give much for a cigarette,” she announced out of a long\r\nsilence at ten o’clock, addressing herself to Seagraves.\r\n\r\n“This isn’t a smoker,” observed the crime specialist, glancing around,\r\n“but there are only two other passengers in the car. Try it.”\r\n\r\nHe offered her his box, and she took one and lighted it. Filling her\r\nlungs with the comforting smoke, she exhaled it in a great cloud and,\r\nafter a meditative pause, murmured:\r\n\r\n“At last I am to see poor Paul.”\r\n\r\nShe looked Seagraves steadily in the eye and added in a queer tone that\r\nshe felt her brother was very near tonight.\r\n\r\nIt was a mixed train, and the day coaches appeared to have much the\r\nbetter of the sleepers as to occupancy. Seagraves noted casually that,\r\nbesides themselves, their car boasted but two other passengers, and\r\nthough they might have been snugly asleep in their respective berths,\r\nthey had apparently elected to sit out the short run, evidently\r\npreferring reclining to rising and dressing at 1:30 or 2 o’clock A. M.\r\n\r\n“Do you see the man sitting all alone in the last seat with the\r\nhandkerchief over his face, to keep the light out of his eyes?” Olga’s\r\nruminant voice finally broke in upon the monotonous _clackety-clack_ of\r\nwheels upon rail-joints.\r\n\r\n“Yes--what about him?” asked Seagraves.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, only he--he looks like Paul,” she answered in a guarded\r\nvoice, as though she feared Brandon, cat-napping now, might overhear\r\nher strange language.\r\n\r\n“Olga!” ridiculed the detective, “get a grip on yourself.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus counseled the prisoner, Seagraves was thoughtful for a long\r\nspace; then he looked over at Olga, saw an odd, uneasy expression on\r\nher pretty face and quickly said:\r\n\r\n“Here--have another cigarette, Olga. Burn ’em up!”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt midnight the conductor passed through the car.\r\n\r\n“We’ll make the city a little before two o’clock,” he said in answer to\r\na sleepy-voiced interrogation from Brandon, who seemed to have banished\r\nsleep and was blinking about the car.\r\n\r\n“What--we all alone?” he asked Seagraves. Then he caught sight of the\r\ntwo lonely passengers at the far end of the car. “No; two others,” he\r\nmurmured, answering his own question.\r\n\r\nHe was turning his gaze away from the man with the handkerchief over\r\nhis face when something, Seagraves noted, drew his eyes inquiringly\r\nback to the sleeper’s hunched figure. The movement caused Seagraves to\r\nfollow Brandon’s scrutiny. He marked the fact that the handkerchief\r\nhad fallen from their fellow-passenger’s face, and--was it because\r\nof Olga’s suggestion, or was it merely a silly midnight fancy?--he\r\nassuredly seemed to trace a certain vague resemblance between the\r\nsolitary sleeper and the notorious Paul Slavsky, long ago dead.\r\n\r\nThe idea brought with it a queer, though distinct, sense of\r\nunpleasantness. The booming voice of Brandon, breaking in upon his\r\nwholly disagreeable train of thought, was highly reassuring.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” laughed the Inspector, “I thought I recognized that chap.”\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to one, Seagraves shook Brandon out of a doze and said,\r\n“Keep the lady company for a few minutes. I’m going into the smoker.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Joe,” drawled Brandon opening his slightly reddened eyes\r\nand seeming to be perfectly wide awake.\r\n\r\nSeagraves disappeared into the smoking-room, returning some ten or\r\nfifteen minutes later. To his surprise he noted that Brandon, evidently\r\nnot caring to take a chance on Olga’s diving out of the open window,\r\nhad handcuffed her fast to the seat and had once more fallen asleep.\r\nOlga herself appeared a trifle more cheerful. She even smiled, though\r\nsomewhat wearily, as Seagraves resumed his seat beside her.\r\n\r\n“I told you it would be Paul,” the woman whispered to Seagraves, as\r\nthough determined to share no part of her secret with the despised\r\nBrandon. “See,” she insisted, growing almost jubilant, “it is my\r\nbrother Paul--come back to me at last!”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Olga,” cried Seagraves disgustedly, “stop that\r\nfoolishness. It gets on my nerves.”\r\n\r\nStillness then for several minutes.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden Seagraves felt cold. He turned up his coat collar and,\r\nsomehow rather depressed, sat looking across at the muffled figure of\r\nBrandon who, also evidently having felt the night chill, had wound a\r\ngreat muffler about his neck and pulled his ample Stetson low over his\r\nface. Seagraves reflected that this would be a fitting case with which\r\nto crown a long list of his old friend’s successes. Tomorrow he would\r\ncongratulate him.\r\n\r\nA long wild shriek from the locomotive startled Seagraves like an\r\nunexpected blow.\r\n\r\n“Ha!” he said, “I must be developing nerves after all these years.\r\nAnyhow, we’re getting in.”\r\n\r\nThen he raised his eyes and saw that the man, who, he had imagined,\r\nresembled Paul Slavsky, had disappeared. So had the only other\r\npassenger who had occupied a seat near him. It struck Seagraves as\r\nsingular.\r\n\r\nAnother long wail from the locomotive blent dissonantly with the dreary\r\n_clackety-clack, clackety-clack_ of the car-wheels, and at the same\r\ninstant the vestibule door was smashed open. Through it came stumbling,\r\ncovered with blood, clothing torn to tatters, the identical man who had\r\nresembled Paul Slavsky.\r\n\r\nHis hands were securely cuffed, and he was being partly shoved and\r\npartly dragged forward along the aisle for all the world as though he\r\nwere a wax dummy. His captor was no other than the traveler whom the\r\ndetective had seen sitting near the dead Terrorist’s double.\r\n\r\n“He fought like a tiger, Mr. Seagraves, but I finally got him. He’s one\r\nof Olga’s bunch--a second brother of hers, in fact. He heard that she\r\nwas hard pressed and just landed from Europe to help her escape.”\r\n\r\nJoe Seagraves sat like one stupefied. Jim McLean, of the Central\r\nOffice, cleverly disguised as an innocent-looking rustic, had captured\r\na third Slavsky, but how--where?\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” McLean was explaining. “You see, Renfrow got wind of\r\nthis fellow’s game, got hold of a picture of him and sent me out to\r\nride back with you and Brandon and the lady. I fell asleep in earnest,\r\nwhile pretending to be, and waked up just as my man was slipping out of\r\nthe car. I got a good look at his face then and, recognizing him, made\r\nthe first move in a scrap that lasted through six coaches and clear up\r\nto the coal-tender.”\r\n\r\n“Why was the man slipping out?” demanded Seagraves, perplexedly.\r\n\r\n“Ah! that’s it. I missed you from the car and suspected something\r\nwrong. Brandon seemed to be asleep and the woman was laughing. That was\r\nenough. I collared my man.”\r\n\r\nJoe Seagraves reached over and gently shook Brandon, who, still\r\nsleeping like a rock, had slumped low down in the angle formed by the\r\nseat and the window.\r\n\r\n“Come out of it!” the detective bawled at his companion, “we’re getting\r\nin.”\r\n\r\nBut Brandon slept on. Seagraves waited a moment, then shook him again,\r\nalmost violently.\r\n\r\n“Come on, Larry!” he said, himself rising.\r\n\r\nBut Brandon did not stir, and Seagraves darted a questioning glance at\r\nOlga, still handcuffed fast to the seat. To his amazement and alarm the\r\nwoman was smiling, triumphantly, terribly. A vague surmise, which had\r\ncome into Seagraves head hours before, was now confirmed.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubting that leering and awful smile. She had bitten the\r\nblood from her carmine lips. Olga Slavsky had gone stark mad!\r\n\r\nIn all the years that followed, Joe Seagraves was never able to free\r\nhis memory from the haunting horror of the thing he beheld when,\r\nBrandon not reacting to violent shakes, he grew suspicious and lifted\r\nhis unresponsive friend’s big hat off his head--or rather off--_a\r\nvacant-eyed and staring dummy head_!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPaul Slavsky had not _returned_ as Olga had predicted he would, but a\r\nlast gruesome reminder of his own hideous handiwork was nevertheless\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWhen the first shock of horror had passed, and Seagraves and McLean\r\nagain focused their incredulous eyes on Olga Slavsky, they knew that\r\nthe woman, though handcuffed, had herself participated in this last\r\nact of terrorism in America. It was incredible, but there, before the\r\ndetectives’ eyes, were the facts themselves.\r\n\r\nThe blood from her bitten lips streaking her Patrician chin, Olga sat\r\ncomposedly folding and unfolding her daintily-patterned hands, quite\r\nas a vampire folds and unfolds its repellent wings; toying, as might\r\na child, with the polished handcuffs which supposedly had held her a\r\nprisoner, and--before the amazed eyes of her beholders--_slipping the\r\nlocked manacles on and off over her tiny, flexible hands_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Unearth Vast Wealth in Egyptian Tomb\r\n\r\n\r\nRare treasures of art, priceless gems and the royal trappings of\r\nancient times were discovered by archaeologists when they tunneled\r\ntheir way into the funeral chambers of King Tutankhamen [1358-1350, B.\r\nC.] in the Valley of Kings near Luxor, Egypt. Describing the discovery,\r\nLord Carnarvon wrote to a Chicago newspaper correspondent:\r\n\r\n“At last a passage was cleared. We again reached a sealed door or wall.\r\nWe wondered if we should find another staircase, probably blocked,\r\nbehind this wall, or whether we should get into a chamber. I asked Mr.\r\nCarter to take out a few stones and have a look in. He pushed his head\r\npartly into the aperture. With the help of a candle, he could dimly\r\ndiscern what was inside.... ‘These are marvelous objects here,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“I myself went to the hole, and I could with difficulty restrain my\r\nexcitement. At the first sight, with the inadequate light, all that one\r\ncould see was what appeared to be gold bars. On getting a little more\r\naccustomed to the light, it became apparent that there were colossal\r\ngilt couches with extraordinary heads, boxes here and boxes there. We\r\nenlarged the hole and Mr. Carter managed to scramble in--the chamber is\r\nsunk two feet below the bottom passage--and then, as he moved around\r\nwith a candle, we knew we had found something unique and unprecedented.”\r\n\r\nAmong the many treasures which they found in the tomb were royal robes,\r\nembroidered with precious stones, the state throne of King Tutankhamen,\r\nportraits of the king and queen, incrusted with turquoises, lapis\r\nlazuli and other gems, two life-sized golden statues of the king, with\r\ngold scepter and mace, and four gem-studded chariots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _The_\r\n                           HOUSE _of_ DEATH\r\n\r\n                           _A Strange Tale_\r\n\r\n                        _By_ F. GEORGIA STROUP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three women looked about the little kitchen. For some reason, each\r\nseemed to avoid the eyes of the other.\r\n\r\n“My land, but it’s hot in here!” Mrs. Prentis moved to the north window\r\nto raise it.\r\n\r\nAs she propped up the heavy sash with a thin board that lay on the\r\nsill, a gust of hot wind swept through the room from a drought-parched\r\nKansas cornfield.\r\n\r\nSeeking relief in action, her daughter, Selina, hastened to the\r\nopposite window and pushed it up, as a cloud of dust thickened in the\r\nroad in front of the house. A small herd of bawling cattle were milling\r\npast the house in the heat and glare of the August sun. Their heads\r\ndrooped dejectedly and their tongues lolled from parched mouths.\r\n\r\n“My land, Seliny, there goes another bunch of cattle out west. Does\r\nbeat all how hard ’tis to get water in this country. Jes’ seems to me\r\nsometimes like I’d die for a sight of mountains an’ green things an’ a\r\ntumblin’ little stream that’d run an’ ripple all summer.”\r\n\r\nMotherly Mrs. Collins wiped the perspiration from her large, red face\r\nand fanned herself with her blue sunbonnet.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t Mamie Judy come from the mountain country?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes; we went to the same school. When she was a girl she had the\r\nblackest eyes and the prettiest red cheeks of any girl you ever did\r\nsee. Didn’t look much like she does now! A farmer’s wife soon goes to\r\npieces. She was such a lively girl, too--so full of fun. An’ now jes’\r\nto think what the poor thing’s come to!”\r\n\r\nAgain the three women avoided each other’s eyes. Then Selina spoke\r\nnervously:\r\n\r\n“Do you ’spose she did it, Ma?”\r\n\r\n“There you go with your ’sposin’ again! Better get to work and\r\nstraighten up this house. That’s what we come over for, ain’t it?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Collins rose heavily from her chair and unrolled and donned a\r\ncarefully-ironed, blue-checked apron.\r\n\r\n“Seems kinda funny to have the funeral here, don’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. The graveyard’s handy an’ it’s so far to the church.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s so; ’tain’t far to the cemetry. Always seemed to me that\r\nMamie’d found it kinda spooky, always seein’ the graveyard right\r\nthrough that window there over the stove. Bein’ up on top of that rise,\r\nan’ only half a mile away, would make it seem to me kinda like livin’\r\nin a graveyard.”\r\n\r\n“Selina, take this here bucket an’ bring in some water. My land, I\r\ndon’t see how Mamie ever got through with all her work an’ took care\r\nof the baby. Her bein’ so old, an’ it her first, made it harder, too.\r\nNever thought her an’ Jed would have any children.”\r\n\r\n“Things do need reddin’ up pretty considerable,” spoke Mrs. Collins, as\r\nshe picked up some odds and ends of clothing from a corner, where they\r\nhad lain long enough to accumulate a coating of acrid dust.\r\n\r\n“My jes’ look at the linin’ in this firebox! How d’you ever ’spose\r\nMamie managed to cook on it?”\r\n\r\n“Must have been pretty hard. She didn’t have things fixed as handy as\r\nsome of the rest of us, even. You see, they didn’t have much money to\r\nspend on things. Farmin’ in Kansas ain’t been a payin’ business the\r\nlast few years. When ’tain’t too wet, it’s too dry, or too hot, or too\r\ncold, or somethin’.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it seems like there’s always somethin’. There--I’ve got that\r\nsweepin’ done. We’ll let Selina scrub, while we fix up the front room.”\r\n\r\nThe two women opened the door into the “front” room. The blinds were\r\ntightly drawn and the musty odor testified to its lengthy isolation.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“My land! look at that, will you?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Prentis pointed to a cheap colored glass on the center-table,\r\nwhich held a pitiful little bouquet of one immortelle, six pale spears\r\nof a rank grass and a carefully-cut-out letterhead of a printed spray\r\nof orange blossoms.\r\n\r\n“Who’d a thought of tryin’ to make a bouquet out o’ that? I remember,\r\nwhen we were back in Tennessee, that Mamie was always findin’ the first\r\ndeer’s tongues and other kinds of little early flowers. Us big girls\r\nalways helped fill her little hands. Seemed like she never could get\r\nall she wanted. An’ then think of livin’ out here where there ain’t\r\nwater enough for things that has to have it, let alone flowers. Why,\r\nI remember one summer when we even saved the dishwater to use several\r\ntimes, and then fed it to the pigs ’cause water was so scarce.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the way farmer’s wives have to worry ’long, ’tain’t much wonder\r\nso many of ’em go crazy. I read in th’ paper that was ’round a bundle\r\nthat come from the store that a bigger part of farmers’ wives went\r\ncrazy than any other kind of women.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve heard that too. Let’s jes’ step in an’ pick up in the\r\nbedroom, and then sweep both these rooms out together. The wind’s in\r\nth’ right direction.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you come with me. We--we could get done sooner, workin’\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“That must be the pallet an’ this th’ pillow. They say the\r\nbaby had been dead for several hours when Jed found it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, an’ Mamie settin’ out there in the barn door, with her head in\r\nher lap. Not cryin’ nor nothin’.”\r\n\r\nThe two women hesitated, lingered at their task. Something kept them\r\nfrom moving the things that the coroner had kept in so rigidly exact a\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“Yes; there’s somethin’ mighty queer about it. My land, jes’ think, she\r\nmight be--HUNG!” in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\nBoth faces blanched at the hitherto unspoken possibility. A\r\nwoman--neighbor and friend, and the childhood acquaintance of one of\r\nthem--was imprisoned on the charge of killing her baby.\r\n\r\nThey felt that they ought to have a feeling of horror. It was a\r\nterrible crime, with seemingly only one explanation, but to both there\r\narose visions of the unexpected satisfying of the craving mother heart\r\nof the work-worn farm drudge; of her seeming happiness and joy at the\r\nlittle cuddling head in the hollow of her arm and the soft lips on the\r\nbreast, as the little form was held tightly to its mother’s bosom.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what the coroner’s jury said, I don’t believe Mamie could\r\n’a’ done it. But still--if she didn’t, who _did_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, an’ then, if she didn’t do it, why don’t she say so? She knows\r\nthey might hang her.”\r\n\r\n“They say she ain’t said one word since Jed found her out there in the\r\nbarn door. My land, but ain’t it hot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there bein’ no trees ’round here, jes’ seems like the sun bakes\r\nright through the roof. Well, we might as well begin to pick up. The\r\nfuneral’s at ten tomorrow. I can come over early; can you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ll be here. I’m goin’ to stay an’ set up tonight. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nShinkle said they’d come over. Selina can get supper for her pa an’ th’\r\nboys.”\r\n\r\n“We’d better change them cloths.”\r\n\r\nThe women tiptoed into the little lean-to, with that expectant hush\r\nthat the presence of death always causes.\r\n\r\nOn an improvised table, a little form lay covered with a sheet, above\r\na box of slowly melting ice. The country ministrations of neighborly\r\nservice were completed, and the women left the room and returned to\r\ntheir task of cleaning in the front of the little farmhouse.\r\n\r\n“My land, but it’s quiet here! Bein’ so far off the main road, seems\r\nlike a person never sees nor hears nobody. It’s enough to drive a\r\nperson crazy.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe older woman had been standing for several minutes, with her mind\r\npreoccupied by struggling thought. At last she spoke:\r\n\r\n“See here, Mis’ Prentis, if this pillow’d been standing up like this,\r\nit could’ve fell over on the baby. See?”\r\n\r\nBoth women bent over the carefully-folded bedclothing, placed upon\r\nthe floor for the sake of a slightly cooler strata of air and also to\r\nobviate the possibility of the baby rolling off, while the mother was\r\nbusy in some of the many tasks of the unaided farmer’s wife.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, the bedroom was straightened and the two rooms\r\nswept and dusted. Then Mrs. Prentis paused as she gave a final look\r\naround the rooms, walked to one of the windows on the south and ran a\r\nspeculative finger over the glass. It was so heavily coated with dust\r\nas to be practically opaque. Then she stepped to the two windows on the\r\neast side of the room and looked at them. The panes of glass in both\r\nwere clean and carefully polished.\r\n\r\n“Now why do you suppose that is?” she asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Collins, who had been following her moves, shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” she answered, “Did you notice that the one in the\r\nkitchen, on the south side above the stove, hadn’t been washed, either?\r\nI noticed it when I went over to look at the firebox when you spoke.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s so,” said Mrs. Prentis, standing in the kitchen door and\r\nglancing at the south windows of one room and then at the other.\r\n\r\n“See here, do you ’spose--that is--I mean both of these windows on the\r\nsouth side are toward the graveyard--do you ’spose that Mamie left ’em\r\nthat way _on purpose_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s a good deal to do on a farm, and mebbe she got as far as\r\nthe south side washin’ windows some day, and then had to quit for some\r\nreason.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but these ain’t been washed for _months_. Poor little Mamie!\r\nMebbe she just couldn’t stand to be everlastingly seein’ them\r\ngravestones.”\r\n\r\n“I wish, oh _how_ I wish, I’d ’a ’come over here oftener! We don’t live\r\nso far away; but seems like I never get time to get all my work done,\r\nand when I do there’s not time to walk, or I’m too tired, an’ o’ course\r\nthe horses are always busy.\r\n\r\n“What with fruit cannin’, and hayin’ hands, an’ threshin’, an’ little\r\nchickens, the summer’s gone ’fore you know it, an’ then the winter’s\r\ntoo cold and snowy, or too wet an’ muddy to get out, an’ the first\r\nthing you know another year’s slipped by.”\r\n\r\nMotherly Mrs. Collins nodded her head in sympathy. An older and a\r\nheavier woman, all that Mrs. Prentis had said applied better than\r\nequally well to her.\r\n\r\n“No wonder Mamie loved the baby so,” she said, “though she ain’t been\r\noverly strong since it was born. Jes’ think of the years and years she\r\nwas here all alone, for Jed used to work out a good deal an’ she done\r\nall the work here. Years an’ years of stillness--an’ then the baby\r\nshe’d never give up wantin’ and hopin’ for.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, when I think what a woman’s got to go through here on a farm,\r\nI don’t never want Selina should get married. Seems like it’s enough\r\nsometimes to make a mother wish her girl baby could die when it’s\r\nlittle--”\r\n\r\nShe gasped. Both women gave a frightened start.\r\n\r\n“No; ’course I don’t mean that,” she added hastily. “I jes’ mean you\r\nlove ’em so that it don’t seem no ways right for ’em to have to grow up\r\nto what you see in front of ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we better quit talkin’ an’ lay out th’ baby’s things. ’Spose we\r\nlook in the bureau in the bedroom.”\r\n\r\nThey moved again to the inner room and pulled out the top drawer of the\r\nold-fashioned marble-topped bureau.\r\n\r\nA few shirts, a pile of carefully mended underwear and some socks,\r\nrolled and turned together in two’s, met their gaze.\r\n\r\n“That’s Jed’s drawer. Let’s see what’s in the next one.”\r\n\r\nThe second drawer revealed a freshly-ironed white waist carefully\r\nfolded above a meager pile of woman’s underwear. Without a word, Mrs.\r\nPrentis pushed it shut.\r\n\r\nThe third drawer proved to be the one they wanted. Small piles of\r\ncarefully made baby clothing of cheap material, but workmanship of\r\ninfinite pains, met their view.\r\n\r\nMrs. Collins wiped the tears from her cheeks with the corner of her\r\napron.\r\n\r\n“See--they’re nearly ever’one made by hand and all white. Most of ’em\r\njes’ flour sacks, but look how Mamie’s bleached ’em. An’ see this\r\ndrawn-work.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she placed a work-reddened hand beneath a narrow strip of\r\nopenwork.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you can go home now,” in answer to a question from Selina in the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n“My, the pains she’s took on all these little things! Seems ’s if she\r\nmust ’a’ been gettin’ ’em ready all these years, an’ now--” Her voice\r\ntrailed off into silence.\r\n\r\nThe little clothing was laid on the bed in readiness for the morrow,\r\nand the women looked about as though hunting something more to do. Used\r\nto the busy hours of farm life, they felt impelled to some task that\r\nwould occupy the passing hours.\r\n\r\n“Let’s see if there’s anything we ought to do upstairs.”\r\n\r\nThey climbed the narrow ladderlike stairway to an unfinished half-story\r\ngarretlike room above.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“My land, she was house-cleanin’ this hot weather!”\r\n\r\nHalf of the stuffy little room had been thoroughly overhauled and the\r\nother end begun. A little old horse-hair trunk stood in the middle of\r\nthe floor, with portions of its contents scattered about.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet she was goin’ to empty that for the baby’s things. I showed\r\nher mine, jes’ like it, that I fixed up for Selina when she was little.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we might as well pick up the things and put ’em back,” said\r\norderly Mrs. Collins, who suited the word to the action by laboriously\r\nbending with a slight grunt.\r\n\r\nMrs. Prentis pushed her back.\r\n\r\n“Here, let me pick ’em up. There ain’t no call for you to go stoopin’\r\n’round in this heat. First thing you know you’ll be havin’ a stroke.”\r\n\r\nSome clothing and small articles were collected, and several bundles\r\nof yellowed old letters lay on the floor. From one of the packages the\r\nstring had broken, evidently when it had been lifted from the trunk.\r\nOne letter lay crumpled near its empty envelope, where it had been\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nWith a wondering glance, the two women smoothed it out. The first\r\nparagraph was so yellowed and faded as to be illegible, but part of the\r\nsecond paragraph had been protected by the folded paper and they could\r\nread:\r\n\r\n “_ ... will say that your wife is hopelessly insane. She may live for\r\n years, but will never regain her mentality, as cases like hers are\r\n incurable. We find upon investigation that the women of her family,\r\n for several generations, have become hopelessly insane at her age._\r\n\r\n “_In view of the fact that your small daughter is tainted with this\r\n inherited insanity, we strongly advise you to take her to some new\r\n environment and, when she grows older, explain to her why marriage\r\n should be considered impossible for her._\r\n\r\n “_As we can see the matter now, it is too bad that her mother was not\r\n warned of the same fact, and in view of all our information it would\r\n seem to have been better if we had not pulled her through that severe\r\n illness. If you--_”\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the letter was undecipherable. The two neighbors\r\nlooked at each other, their eyes wide with horror. At last Mrs. Prentis\r\ngasped hoarsely:\r\n\r\n“Do you ’spose that bundle broke open and Mamie read this letter? Her\r\nfather died ’fore she was old enough to marry and left her this place\r\npartly paid for, and I remember when her and Jed was married how they\r\nplanned to pay the rest of it off jes’ as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\n“But,” interrupted Mrs. Collins, “the coroner’s jury said yesterday\r\nthat they wasn’t any manner of doubt but that she _wasn’t_ crazy. She\r\njes’ set there, with her solemn big eyes, and looked straight ahead and\r\nnever said a word.\r\n\r\n“I wonder how a woman’d feel to know that the baby girl she loved\r\nbetter’n her own life would have to grow up in this drudgery and then\r\nfinally spend the last of her years in a ’sylum?”\r\n\r\n“Yes and ’spose Mamie went crazy herself long ’fore the little girl\r\ngrew up?”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if a woman really loved her baby girl if she wouldn’t\r\nrather--” she stopped once more with a frightened look.\r\n\r\nWheels were heard coming down the lane.\r\n\r\nMrs. Prentis spoke quickly: “Sarah Ann Collins, we’re goin’ right\r\ndownstairs and stick this letter in that cook-stove, quick!”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the little kitchen below, the women were cooking supper when the\r\ncounty attorney and another man entered.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, ladies,” said the attorney. “We decided to come out\r\nagain and go carefully over the field to see if we could find any\r\nevidence. You haven’t, by chance, found anything, have you?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Prentis looked covertly at Mrs. Collins, then answered:\r\n\r\n“No; we jes’ been cleanin’ up. We ain’t been lookin’ for no evidence.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Walters,” said the attorney, “you know juries when it comes to\r\nwomen. If there never is found a definite reason for her wanting the\r\nbaby to die, no jury will ever believe she is guilty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               “Evil Demon” Drives Man to Orgy of Crime\r\n\r\n\r\nSpurned by his young niece, Estanislao Puyat, a Filipino, ran amuck in\r\nthe streets of Manila, after throwing the girl from an upper window to\r\nthe ground and almost killing her. Grabbing his bolo, he rushed down\r\nthe street, stabbed an aged woman in the eye, cut off the hands of two\r\nother women, slashed another, stabbed a Chinese merchant and a cart\r\ndriver, cut another woman on the forehead, wounded a child and a young\r\nFilipino girl, and then, reaching the Bay, threw himself into the water\r\nin an effort to commit suicide. Capt. H. H. Elarth threw a noose over\r\nhis head and dragged him ashore. The Filipinos say that Puyat was “de\r\nmalas,” meaning he was possessed of an evil demon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _A Five-minute Story_\r\n\r\n                             _The_ Gallows\r\n\r\n                         _By_ I. W. D. PETERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTomorrow morning, at sunrise, I am to hang for the murder of a man.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the ninth of June, the anniversary of my wedding day. I\r\nam to be hanged by the neck until I am dead.\r\n\r\nI am glad this state has not yet adopted the use of electricity in\r\nexecutions. I prefer to spend my last moments out in the open under the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe building of the gallows is finished; the workmen are gone, and it\r\nseems that the execution at sunrise is certain to take place; but every\r\nstep along the corridor sends my heart into my mouth. Gladys is working\r\nfor a reprieve. I am praying she will not succeed.\r\n\r\nThe Governor is off on a fishing trip, away from railroad and\r\ntelegraph. If they do not locate him in the next few hours I shall be\r\nhanged. God grant they fail to find him!\r\n\r\nIt is Glady’s will against mine. She usually wins, but every passing\r\nminute lessens her chance to have her way in this. It is now ten\r\nminutes to midnight. Dr. Brander, the prison chaplain, has just left\r\nme, gratified, poor fellow, that he has succeeded in reconciling me to\r\nmy fate. If he had known that the tall skeleton of wood outside, with\r\nits lank line of rope, was in my mind a refuge, he would have turned\r\nfrom me in horror.\r\n\r\nThe next five hours will be the longest of my life. Every step in the\r\ncorridor strikes fear to my heart. It is not because I am guilty of the\r\ncrime, for which I was sentenced, that I am glad to die. I _am_ guilty,\r\nbut that doesn’t mean that I deserve to die.\r\n\r\nI am going to hang tomorrow at sunrise because _I want to be hung_!\r\n\r\nI could have saved myself, but refused to do so, solely because life\r\nhad lost its savor, a great wave of disgust with living possessed and\r\nstill possesses me. I am writing these words now that Gladys may know\r\nthe truth. She has tried to see me, ever since I was brought here, and\r\nI have refused to be seen. That is one right a condemned man has--to\r\nrefuse to see visitors.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the day we were married, Gladys demanded to know my every thought,\r\nmy every act every hour of the day.\r\n\r\nIf every one of them was not concerned with her she criticised,\r\ncondemned or cried. She resented, in bitterly-spoken words and equally\r\nbitter acts, the small recesses of my soul that I, for the sake of my\r\nown self-respect, kept to myself.\r\n\r\nFinally she determined to show me that there were other men who\r\nappreciated her, if I did not. For a while, after that, all hours of\r\nthe day and evening my home was infested with lounge lizards. I endured\r\nit without a word, which infuriated her.\r\n\r\nLester Caine, a young fellow, honest and simple, was her first victim.\r\nThe first time I found him seated close beside her on the dimly lit\r\nporch I welcomed him warmly. We smoked and talked of our days in the\r\narmy together. I felt that Gladys could safely enough flirt with such\r\nas Lester, if that was what she wanted: but Lester called only a few\r\ntimes after that.\r\n\r\nFor two months there was a succession of young fellows about the place.\r\nOur house was not far from the Westmoor Country Club, and the golf\r\nlinks came almost up to our side-yard. Our porch was a convenient place\r\nto “drop in.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly all that sort of thing ceased. Gladys was away a great deal,\r\nbut as her mother lived in a town just a few miles away I thought\r\nnothing of that. She became very quiet, was thoughtful, absent-minded,\r\nflushed easily, seemed not herself.\r\n\r\nAt first I was a good deal puzzled, then, suddenly an explanation for\r\nthe change in her dawned on me. Joy filled my soul. I was inordinately\r\ngentle with her, bought her a small automobile for her birthday, did\r\neverything I could think of for her comfort and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I told myself, the emotional phase she had passed through\r\nwas natural. Marriage is a more difficult readjustment with some than\r\nothers. It had evidently been so with Gladys. If a child came to us it\r\nwould make everything right.\r\n\r\nA child--_our child_! It was wonderful to think of. She had always\r\nrefused to consider the subject saying she wished to enjoy life while\r\nshe was young. But she knew I wanted a son to bear my name, a daughter\r\nto inherit her beauty, and she had accepted the inevitable. A wave of\r\nexaltation made me feel as if I were treading on clouds. I longed to\r\nmention the subject to her, but I felt that the first word about it\r\nshould come from her.\r\n\r\nI spent hours thinking of tender, loving things to do for her. She\r\naccepted everything quietly, sometimes with averted face and flushed\r\ncheeks. I would draw her inert figure into my arms and hold her close,\r\nbut she made no response to my demonstrative affection.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of affairs my firm sent me on a ten-day trip to close a\r\nWestern deal. It was hard to leave Gladys, but now, more than ever, I\r\nfelt that we would need money, and lots of it.\r\n\r\nWe arranged for Gladys to go to her mother’s, and I was to join her\r\nthere on my return.\r\n\r\nIt is the same old story. I came home before I was expected, and went\r\nstraight to our cottage, with the intention of having Glady’s room\r\nredecorated before bringing her home.\r\n\r\nAt the gate stood Gladys’ car. I rushed into the house, but there was\r\nno one on the lower floor, nor in Gladys’ room, nor mine. I was about\r\nto descend the stairs when I heard a low laugh--a man’s laugh--from the\r\nthird floor. I dashed up there and stood gazing at the closed door of\r\nthe spare room.\r\n\r\n“What’s the idea, running away from me?” asked the man. “You can’t blow\r\nhot and cold with me.”\r\n\r\n“I told you not to come here again. It’s not safe.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid of that husband of yours. You’re mine, and you’re going\r\nto stay mine.”\r\n\r\nI had listened intently, but could not recognize the man’s voice.\r\n\r\n“Go now,” pleaded Gladys, “and I’ll come to your rooms this evening.”\r\n\r\n“Not on your life! I’m here now, and I am going to stay.”\r\n\r\n“Let go of me--you are hurting my shoulder.”\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of scuffing. I tried the door. It was locked. I put\r\nmy shoulder to it. The lock snapped.\r\n\r\nGladys gave a cry, leaped away from the man--a man whom I had never\r\nseen before. The full-lipped, black-browed type, big, soft. As I took\r\nin the scene--the tousled woman, the flushed-faced man--a great wave of\r\ndisgust almost overwhelmed me.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the man, sneeringly, “what are you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“If you take her away now and treat her right--nothing.”\r\n\r\n“And if I don’t take her away?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll meet that situation when it comes.”\r\n\r\n“It has come,” he said, with a laugh, and walked out.\r\n\r\nI am tall, slender, delicate-looking, but I knew I was a match for that\r\noverfed brute.\r\n\r\nI listened to the clatter of his feet on the stairs. Then I followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man was hastening toward a street car.\r\n\r\nI cranked Gladys’ car and followed. It was easy to keep the street car\r\nin sight and to keep an eye on his sleek black head.\r\n\r\nHe left the car at Hanson Street. I, without a glance toward him, kept\r\non ahead. I turned at the corner, in time to see him enter an office\r\nbuilding. I was not far behind him when he took the elevator. The man\r\nin the elevator gave me the number of his office.\r\n\r\nHe was telling a joke to his typist as I entered, but his laughter died\r\nwhen he saw me.\r\n\r\n“You dirty thief! You’ll never cheat another man out of money!”\r\n\r\nHis look of astonishment, as I shouted these words, was amusing. He\r\ntried to give blow for blow, but I meant what I said when I shouted at\r\nhim “I’ve come here to kill you!”\r\n\r\nTo choke the life out of an overfed beast is not so hard to an\r\ninfuriated man. In less than a quarter of an hour he was dead. The\r\npolice, for whom the typist had called, filled the room even before I\r\nhad straightened my disheveled clothing.\r\n\r\nI practically tried my own case, and I was skillful enough to make\r\nevery word, apparently uttered in my own defense, sound black against\r\nme.\r\n\r\nGladys tried to save me by telling the true story of the affair, but I\r\nmade a picture of her as a devoted, self-sacrificing wife, willing to\r\nruin even her spotless name to save her husband. I enjoyed seeing her\r\ncringe as I did this.\r\n\r\nSo skillfully had she and the big brute managed that there was not a\r\nbit of evidence to substantiate her story. On the other hand, there was\r\nthe typist’s story to help me, and, too, it was known I had speculated\r\nin the past, and that I had lost some money.\r\n\r\nI made the most of everything against me, and it was enough. I was\r\nsentenced to hang on the ninth day of June at sunrise.\r\n\r\nGladys came to the jail to see me while the trial was going on, but\r\nI managed to act just as if my story were the true one and hers the\r\nfalse, and, though she pleaded with me to let the truth come out, I\r\nwould not admit that the truth had _not_ come out. The sentence was a\r\nterrible shock to her. Her mother carried her from the court-room in a\r\nfaint. Before she recovered I was in prison.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall welcome the hour of sunrise as I never welcomed any moment of\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nNot until then will the fear of a reprieve leave me. Gladys is moving\r\nheaven and earth to locate the Governor. God grant that she does not\r\nsucceed!\r\n\r\nIt is four forty-five. I have spent much time at the window, gazing\r\nout into the darkness. What comes after death? That is the question, I\r\nsuppose, that all men ask at the end of life. I have never done so. It\r\nis a futile question--one which none of us can answer. But I believe\r\nthere will be surcease from the nausea that comes to those who have\r\nknown disillusion and disappointment.\r\n\r\nTen minutes of five--now surely I am safe from even a chance of a\r\nreprieve!\r\n\r\nFootsteps in the corridor! Is it my escort to the gallows, or--what I\r\nfear most on earth?\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA statement by the warden of Larsen Penitentiary:\r\n\r\n “_If Traylor had spent the brief period, always allotted to a\r\n criminal for a few last words, his reprieve would have reached us\r\n in time to stay the execution; but he walked calmly, unfalteringly\r\n up to the gallows and helped us, with steady hands, adjust the cap\r\n and ropes--and he was dead two minutes before the Governor’s message\r\n reached us._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _For a Grim Tale With a Terrifying\r\n  End We Recommend_\r\n\r\n                                 _The_\r\n                                 SKULL\r\n\r\n                           _By_ HAROLD WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nKimball held up his hand, warningly.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” he exclaimed in a whisper.\r\n\r\nThen he shoved the bottle back from his elbow and reached for his\r\nrevolver, which hung just above the table. Buckling the belt about his\r\nwaist, he leaped for the door and threw it open.\r\n\r\nThe house, raised on pile foundations a dozen feet above the ground,\r\nshook beneath the rush of retreating footsteps. With the swiftness of\r\na wild animal, he gathered himself for the spring--and landed squarely\r\nastride the back of the last of the blacks to quit the place.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the white man brought the native to the ground. Seizing\r\nthe black by the hair, he jerked him to his feet, keeping the naked\r\nbody between himself and the crowd that lurked in the darkness, just\r\nbeyond the ring of light that shone down through the open door.\r\n\r\n“What name?” he demanded in the _beche-de-mer_ of the Islands. “What\r\nfor you come around big fella house? I knock seven bells out of you\r\nquick!”\r\n\r\nStill grasping the man’s kinky wool with his left hand, his right shot\r\nout, landing a terrific blow on the native’s mouth. The black, spitting\r\nblood and broken teeth, squirmed in agony and attempted to give a side\r\nglance at his fellows. Seeing that none intended to aid him, he jerked\r\nhis head to one side in an effort to escape. The white man straightened\r\nit with another blow.\r\n\r\n“What name?” he demanded again.\r\n\r\n“Me good fella boy,” the black answered with an effort. “Me fella\r\nmissionary!”\r\n\r\n“Then you say one fella prayer damn quick!”\r\n\r\nKimball rained blow after blow on his face. The savage shrieked with\r\nagony. In the shadow, the blacks shuffled uneasily, like a herd of\r\ncattle ready to stampede, but the white man seemingly gave them no heed.\r\n\r\nAt last, the punishment completed, he jerked the bow and arrows from\r\nthe unresisting hand of his victim and, whirling him suddenly, gave him\r\na kick and a shove which landed him on all fours in the midst of the\r\nothers. Then, turning, seemingly ignoring the thoroughly frightened\r\nblacks, he reëntered the house.\r\n\r\nThrowing the bow and arrows on the table, he poured himself a stiff\r\ndrink of gin and downed it at a gulp. And then, sitting down beside\r\nthe table, he picked up the weapon and examined it gingerly.\r\n\r\n“Poisoned!” he remarked casually to the man lying on the bed. “I\r\nknocked bloody hell out of Tulagi as a lesson to the rest of ’em.\r\nThey’re getting insolent, with only one of us to handle ’em. Wish to\r\nheaven you were up and around again.”\r\n\r\n“Upon the platform, eh?” the sick man listlessly inquired.\r\n\r\nKimball nodded.\r\n\r\n“They’re gettin’ bold,” he said shortly. “Five hundred niggers are too\r\nmany for one man to keep straight. It’s been plain hell since you went\r\ndown--and then the dog had to turn up his toes. When Donaldson comes\r\nin next week with the _Scary-Saray_ we’ll have to send after a new\r\nnigger-chaser. Chipin’s got a couple extra ones he’s been trainin’ over\r\nat Berande.”\r\n\r\nThe sick man rolled over with a groan.\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven I was taken sick!” he remarked bitterly. “It’s hard, God\r\nknows, but it gave me a chance to find out just what sort of a cur you\r\nare, Kimball.”\r\n\r\nKimball scowled. He half opened his mouth as if to answer. Then,\r\nthinking better of it, he poured himself another drink and resumed his\r\noccupation of examining the weapon he had taken from the native. He\r\nswayed slightly in his chair under the load of liquor he was carrying,\r\nyet his voice was unblurred as, after a minute’s silence, he looked\r\nacross at the other.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you get that out of your head, Hansen?” he remarked. “I’m\r\ngetting bloody well fed up on it.”\r\n\r\nHansen raised himself on an elbow and angrily shook his fist at the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re  ‘getting bloody well fed up on it,’ are you?” he mimicked.\r\n“I should think you would be! I suppose I’m hurtin’ your delicate\r\nfeelings by mentioning it to you, eh? It’s nothing a man should howl\r\nabout, is it?--having one he thought was his best friend pull off a\r\ndirty stunt like that!”\r\n\r\nKimball poured himself another drink. His hand shook slightly as he\r\nraised the glass to his lips.\r\n\r\n“Oh, forget it and go to sleep!” he growled.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ‘forget it,’ you damned crooked, lyin’, double-crosser! I’m apt\r\nt’ forget how you wrote to Gladys and told her I’d taken a nigger wife!\r\nWanted her yourself, didn’t you, you low-down, gin-guzzling rat! It was\r\njust a piece of luck that I was taken sick and you had t’ look after\r\nthe plantation instead of goin’ after th’mail last time, or I’d never\r\nhave got that letter from her telling me why she’d turned me down.”\r\n\r\n“I’m telling you now, for th’ last time, that I didn’t write that\r\nstuff to her!” Kimball snarled back. “I’m tellin’ you it’s a lie. I\r\nshowed you the letter I wrote to her, giving her my word of honor that\r\nsomebody’d been doin’ you dirt.”\r\n\r\n“Who else is there here on the Island that knew her back home?” Hansen\r\ndemanded, dropping back onto the pillows again. “And who else knew that\r\nwe were engaged?”\r\n\r\n“How in hell do I know?” Kimball answered thickly, reaching unsteadily\r\nfor the bottle. “You’re a sick man, Hansen, or I’d beat you up for th’\r\nway you’re talkin’ to me.”\r\n\r\nThe sick man raised himself from the pillows again with a snort of\r\nanger, his face flushed, his eyes gleaming feverishly.\r\n\r\n“It’s a long road that’s got no turn in it!” he muttered. “It’s my\r\nmoney that’s in this plantation, Kimball--my money against your\r\nexperience. And keep that damned arrow pointed th’ other way, you fool!\r\nYou’re drunk--too drunk to be monkeyin’ with weapons. You’d just as\r\nsoon shoot me as not: if you do, I’ll get you if I have to come back\r\nfrom th’ grave to do it! And remember this, Kimball: Soon’s I’m able to\r\nbe up and around again, we’ll have a settlement. And out you’ll go from\r\nthis plantation, you--”\r\n\r\nWhether it was an accident, or plain murder nobody knows. Kimball was\r\ndrunk--beastly so. The arrow was loaded in the bow and clasped between\r\nhis trembling fingers, the bow-string taut. And Hansen had annoyed\r\nhim, angered him, bullied him, cursed him. At any rate, as he slumped\r\nforward in his chair, the bow-string slipped from between his thumb\r\nand finger, and--\r\n\r\nHansen dropped back onto the pillows with a smothered scream, the arrow\r\nburied deep in his temple!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight when Kimball awoke from his drunken stupor.\r\n\r\nFor an instant, he had no recollection of what had happened. The oil\r\nlamp still burned brightly, throwing the figure of the man on the bed\r\nin bold relief.\r\n\r\nKimball half arose on his tiptoes so as not to awaken Hansen. His foot\r\ntouched the bow lying on the floor. Then a flood of realization swept\r\nover him. He suddenly remembered that he was a murderer.\r\n\r\nWhether he had killed Hansen intentionally or not he was unable to\r\nrecall. Memory had ceased on the second he sprawled forward, his tired\r\nbrain benumbed with the liquor he had consumed during the evening. He\r\nknew that they had quarreled--that Hansen had been more abusive than\r\nusual and had cursed him.\r\n\r\nHe stepped across to the bed. A single glance at the bloated face\r\nalready turning black--at the glassy eyes staring back at him\r\nfixedly--told him that his surmise had been correct: the arrow had been\r\ndipped in poison. He shuddered as he pushed the remaining arrows, which\r\nhe had taken from Tulagi, to the back of the table and poured himself\r\nanother drink.\r\n\r\nHe must act at once. Donaldson and the _Scary-Saray_ would arrive\r\nwithin a few days. And Donaldson was no fool. Nor was Svensen, his\r\nmate. Both of them knew that there was bad blood between the partners.\r\nAnd should one of the house boys find the body in the morning it would\r\ncause no end of talk among the niggers. Some of them would be certain\r\nto talk to Donaldson. The big trader might be able to put two and two\r\ntogether and take his suspicions to the authorities.\r\n\r\nReaching up, he pulled down his revolver and, buckling the belt around\r\nhis waist, tiptoed to the door. The rain was falling in torrents,\r\nand the sound of the surf was booming loudly. The sky was split by\r\nlightning, while the thunder rolled and grumbled.\r\n\r\nIt was a typical island squall; he knew it would last but a short time.\r\nYet, while it lasted, the blacks would all be under cover, making him\r\nsafe from spying eyes if he acted at once.\r\n\r\nBut fear--fear of he knew not what--caused him to pull down the shades\r\nuntil not a vestige of light showed at sides or bottom.\r\n\r\nThen, nerving himself with another pull at the bottle, he turned down\r\nthe lamp until the room was in semi-darkness. Again he stepped to the\r\ndoor and, holding it open an inch or two, listened.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, he returned to the bed and picked up the dead form of Hansen\r\nand threw it across his shoulder with a mighty effort. He extinguished\r\nthe lamp with a single puff as he passed the table.\r\n\r\nThen, feeling his way carefully with his feet lest he strike against\r\nsome piece of furniture in the darkness, he sought the door.\r\n\r\nBending his body against the force of the wind, he gained the steps and\r\ndodged around the corner of the house opposite the blacks’ quarters. At\r\nthe edge of the cocoanut grove, he again paused to listen.\r\n\r\nNot a sound came from the direction of the black barracks. Presently,\r\nbeating against the wind, he see-sawed through the grove for a quarter\r\nof a mile.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that he was far enough from the house, he dropped his ghastly\r\nburden to the ground and turned back. The storm would obliterate his\r\ntracks by morning. With the coming of daylight, he would give the\r\nalarm, as if he had just discovered the absence of Hansen.\r\n\r\nHe had gone over the whole thing in his mind as he struggled along. It\r\nwould be easy enough to foist his story upon the simple-minded blacks.\r\nHe would tell them that the sick man had gotten up in the night and\r\nwandered away. Fevers are common in the Islands: so, too, is delirium.\r\nAnd, when the body was found with the arrow in the skull, they would\r\nbelieve that their master had fallen a victim to some wandering savage.\r\n\r\nThere were half a dozen runaways--deserters from the plantation--hiding\r\nback in the bush, afraid to go into the hills for fear of the ferocious\r\nhill men and, at the same time, fearful of the punishment certain to\r\nbe meted out to them should they return to the plantation. One of them\r\nwould be blamed for Hansen’s death. The blacks would vouch for such a\r\nstory when he told it to Donaldson and Svensen upon their arrival.\r\n\r\nHe had covered a small part of the distance back to the house, his\r\nhead bent low in thought, when a rustling among the palms at his right\r\ncaused him to turn suddenly. As he did so, a spear whizzed past his\r\nhead, imbedding itself in the tree beside him.\r\n\r\nWhirling, he drew his revolver and pumped the clip of shells in the\r\ndirection from which the spear had been thrown. It was too dark to\r\nmake for good shooting; and an instant later a flash of lightning\r\nshowed him a naked figure dodging behind a tree in the distance. Too\r\nlate, he realized that he had left the house without an extra clip of\r\ncartridges. Unarmed, he broke into a run, dodging here and there among\r\nthe long avenues of trees until he reached the edge of the grove.\r\n\r\nThe blacks were already tumbling out of their quarters, chattering\r\nexcitedly.\r\n\r\n“Ornburi!” he snapped at one of the houseboys. “You tell ’m fella\r\nboys sick marster, him run away. Got devil-devil in head. Me go after\r\nhim. Meet bad black fella. Black fella kill him mebbe. You look. You\r\ncatch ’m black fella, plenty _kai-kai_ in morning, no work, plenty\r\ntobacco--plenty everything!”\r\n\r\nAs Ornburi stepped forward, proud of being singled out from among his\r\nfellows, and explained to the late comers what had happened, Kimball\r\ndashed back up the steps and into the house. Returning an instant later\r\nwith his rifle and bandolier of cartridges, he found the blacks arming\r\nthemselves with their native weapons, squealing and chattering their\r\nglee at the prospect of the man-hunt and the holiday to follow in case\r\nof their success.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his efforts to maintain some semblance of order, however,\r\nassisted by the elated Ornburi, it was nearly daylight when the\r\nexpedition was ready to start. The rain was nearly over, but a glance\r\nshowed him that the night’s downpour had completely washed out the\r\ntrail he had made. Dodging here and there among the trees, savagely\r\nalert for their hidden enemies, it was almost an hour before the\r\nnatives had covered the distance that Kimball, loaded down as he had\r\nbeen, had covered in twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nThe body of Hansen lay where he had thrown it.\r\n\r\n_But the head had been hacked off!_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _III._\r\n\r\nIn his own mind, Kimball had no doubt as to the identity of the black\r\nwho had hurled the spear at him in the darkness, for a checkup of the\r\nlaborers showed Tulagi missing.\r\n\r\nBitter at the trouncing Kimball had administered, the native had\r\nbolted. Hiding in the darkness, nursing his anger, fate had thrown in\r\nhis way the man who had whipped him. The same fate had caused him to\r\nmiss his mark when he had thrown the spear.\r\n\r\nAnd Tulagi was of a tribe that believed in taking heads for souvenirs.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of Donaldson and Svensen in the _Scary-Saray_ three\r\ndays later, giving him enough white aid to handle the plantation\r\nwithout fear of an uprising, Kimball renewed the search for the\r\nrunaway. Tulagi, at large, would be a constant menace, not only to his\r\nown safety, but to the peace and quiet of the blacks. The runaway was a\r\nman of considerable influence among the others, and there was already\r\ntoo much dissatisfaction among the laborers to allow any additional\r\ntrouble to creep in.\r\n\r\nThe body of the murdered Hansen had been decently buried close to the\r\nedge of the cocoanut grove under Kimball’s direction.\r\n\r\nDonaldson and Svensen never for a moment doubted his story, which\r\nwas corroborated by Ornburi and the blacks. Such things are not\r\nuncommon among the Islands. Both volunteered to aid him in running\r\ndown the supposed murderer. For the supremacy of the white man must be\r\nmaintained for the common good of all.\r\n\r\nIt was near the end of the second day that they found that for which\r\nthey were searching. Beside a skeleton lay a skull, the point of an\r\narrow driven through the temple. A great ant hill close by told a\r\ngrisly story.\r\n\r\nThat one of Kimball’s bullets had found its mark there was little\r\ndoubt. Tulagi, wounded nigh unto death, had, nevertheless stopped long\r\nenough to hack off the ghastly souvenir, then made his way back toward\r\nthe hills as best he could.\r\n\r\nExhausted from loss of blood, he had dropped, only to fall a victim to\r\nthe ants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IV._\r\n\r\nAs the three white men made their way toward the clearing, the sight of\r\na schooner anchored close to the _Scary-Saray_ met their gaze. Drawn up\r\non the beach, close to the house, was a whale boat.\r\n\r\n“From the looks of her, that’ll be Captain Grant’s _Dolphin_ from\r\nMalatita,” Donaldson remarked, shading his eyes from the glare of the\r\nsun. “Didn’t know he ever got this far. Wonder if his daughter’s with\r\nhim? Ever see her, Kimball? She’s a peach!”\r\n\r\nBefore Kimball, walking slightly behind the others and carrying the\r\nskull, could make a reply, a man and woman emerged from the house to\r\nmeet them. Donaldson turned quickly.\r\n\r\n“That’s her!” he exclaimed. “Prettiest girl on the Islands. Hide that\r\ndamned skull, Kimball! It’s no sight for a woman of her breeding to\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\nThey were a scant hundred yards apart now, the girl waving her\r\nhandkerchief to them.\r\n\r\n“It’s a wonder you wouldn’t stay at home to welcome your guests, Karl,”\r\nshe called out. “And Fred Hansen--where is he?”\r\n\r\nKimball strode ahead of the others.\r\n\r\n“Gladys!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Hide that damned skull, I tell you!” Donaldson growled in an undertone.\r\n\r\nThey were almost together now. Kimball shoved the skull under his coat.\r\nAs he did so, it nearly dropped from his sweaty hands and, in an effort\r\nto hold it, his finger slid into one of the eyeless sockets.\r\n\r\nThe point of the arrow, protruding through the bone, scratched his\r\nskin. For the moment he forgot it in the happiness of meeting the woman\r\nhe loved.\r\n\r\n“Dad wanted to make a trading trip out this way, and brought me along\r\nfor company,” she was saying, as he stepped forward to grasp her\r\noutstretched hand. “Say that you’re surprised to see me.”\r\n\r\nBefore she could reach him, his legs doubled under him and he fell\r\nforward. The skull, dropping from beneath his coat, rolled and bounded\r\nhalf a dozen yards away, bringing up at the foot of a little hummock.\r\n\r\nThey leaped forward to catch him as he fell. But too late. With a\r\nmighty effort he raised himself to his knees.\r\n\r\n“Hansen!” he screamed. “I killed him! He swore that he’d get even, and\r\nhe has! _The--damned--thing--was poisoned!_”\r\n\r\nHe pitched forward onto his face.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hummock, the skull grinned sardonically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Novelette of Weird Happenings--_\r\n\r\n                                 _The_\r\n                                Ape-Man\r\n\r\n                       _By_ J. B. M. CLARKE, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let’s go and call on him now then,” said Norton in his impulsive way,\r\nrising and crossing to the window.\r\n\r\nThe fine rain, which had been swishing intermittently against the panes\r\nwith each gust of wind, had ceased for some time, and as Norton lifted\r\nthe blind and peered forth he got the first glimpse of a wan moon\r\nstruggling through an uneven copper-edged break in the swift-moving\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\n“I was to have gone over there this evening,” he said, “but ’phoned the\r\nengagement off on account of the storm. However, it’s not too late....”\r\n\r\nIt did not take much persuasion to induce Meldrum to consent, for,\r\nalthough a year or two Norton’s senior and inclined in consequence to\r\ngive him paternal advice now and again, he generally indulged his whims.\r\n\r\n“You can’t break a teacher of the lecturing habit,” was the way Norton\r\nexpressed it.\r\n\r\nHe himself was an architect, and both were single men, although Norton\r\nwas striving hard to build up a connection that would enable him\r\nto marry one of the prettiest girls in town, with whom he was then\r\n“keeping company.” Meldrum locked the door of his apartment behind him,\r\nand the pair sallied forth into the fresh damp air of a night in early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n“After all you have told me, I am rather curious to see your South\r\nAfrican friend again,” said Meldrum, setting his pace with his\r\nfriend’s. “While no doubt an interest in animals is wholesome enough,\r\nhis particular taste seems to run unpleasantly to apes and monkeys.\r\nSome of those experiments of his, of which you spoke, seem rather\r\npurposeless--making baboons drunk for instance....”\r\n\r\n“If you could have seen him when he was telling me about that baboon\r\nbusiness you would have taken a dislike to him too,” said Norton,\r\nmaking a gesture of displeasure with his hand. “Although I will admit\r\nI had an aversion toward him from the first--I didn’t quite know why.\r\nHe had a trick of laying his hot heavy hand on my shoulder that used\r\nto irritate me dreadfully when we were in the Inspection Department in\r\nWashington.”\r\n\r\n“What was he doing there?” asked Meldrum.\r\n\r\n“He had been inspecting aeroplane spruce in British Columbia,” replied\r\nNorton, “and he had a desk in our office. I was there for about three\r\nmonths after being invalided home, before I was sent to New York.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments’ silence, Norton added:\r\n\r\n“He is more than queer. He is a throw-back.”\r\n\r\n“A what?” said Meldrum, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“A throw-back--an atavistic specimen,” said Norton firmly. “A mixture\r\nof old and new, and a bad one at that.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a pretty nasty accusation, Harry,” said Meldrum.\r\n\r\n“You may think so,” said Norton obstinately, “but I tell you I’m not\r\nsimply guessing. Apart from his peculiar build, with his monstrous\r\nlength of arm and leg, short body, and small head, and his perpetual\r\nand unnatural theories and experiments with apes and things, there is\r\nstill further evidence that I saw with my own eyes when we went to New\r\nYork together one weekend and visited the zoo. It was not my fancy,\r\nI can assure you, Meldrum, that made me imagine the very brutes were\r\ninterested in my companion. I tell you, there was scarcely one of those\r\ncreatures that did not show excitement of some kind, some of rage,\r\nothers of fear, but generally of anger.\r\n\r\n“One big chimpanzee went simply wild for a time--so much so that an\r\nattendant came along to see what the trouble was. It capered furiously,\r\nthundered at the bars of its cage, and then executed a hideous kind\r\nof cluttering dance, beating its hands and feet on the floor with\r\nextraordinary rapidity. Yet all Needham had done was to make a peculiar\r\nkind of clucking noise in his throat and smile his sinister smile. I’ll\r\nbet the brutes recognized him as one of their kind. Some of them looked\r\nas if they expected him to open the cage doors....”\r\n\r\n“What is he doing here in Burlington now?” asked Meldrum.\r\n\r\n“Something in connection with lumber, I believe,” said Norton, as they\r\nentered North Avenue and turned in the direction of the park. “He has\r\nrented a small house out here on this street and lives there alone. He\r\nseems to prefer being alone always.”\r\n\r\nThey walked on for some little distance, and then Norton said, “This is\r\nthe place,” and indicated a small two-story residence standing alone in\r\na neat garden some twenty yards from the thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark save for one lighted window upstairs. The pair went\r\nup the path to the front door and Norton, after a little fumbling,\r\nfound and pressed an electric button, without, however, producing any\r\neffect as far as could be observed.\r\n\r\n“The bell doesn’t seem to ring,” said Norton, pressing again and again.\r\n“Perhaps it’s out of order.”\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the door and listened. Everything was quiet inside. Heavy\r\ndrops of water splashed down from the roof, intensifying the silence.\r\nA trolley-car hummed on the street, throwing a brilliant light on the\r\ntrees and shrubs of the garden, and then leaving them darker than ever.\r\nAgain Norton knocked loudly, but without result.\r\n\r\n“That’s not his bedroom, I know,” he said, nodding up at the lighted\r\nroom, “for he told me he hated the noise of the cars passing under his\r\nwindow. He must have fallen asleep over a book or something. I might\r\nthrow a stone at the window.”\r\n\r\n“No I wouldn’t do that,” said Meldrum, walking back a few paces and\r\nstaring up. “Perhaps we had better just go away. I can meet him again.”\r\n\r\n“But I would like you to see him, now that you’ve come,” said Norton.\r\n“Wait a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe tried the door and found it unlocked. Entering the hall, he called:\r\n\r\n“Needham, Ho, Needham!”\r\n\r\nAgain they listened, and again nothing happened. As he groped in the\r\ndarkness, Norton’s hand encountered the electric switch and he turned\r\non the light. A narrow stairway was revealed, leading overhead.\r\n\r\n“Just wait a minute,” he said to Meldrum, “and I’ll run upstairs. I’m\r\nsure he’s there.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared swiftly, and, after an interval of a few moments, came\r\nquietly down again.\r\n\r\n“Come up,” he said, beckoning to his friend. “He is sound asleep in his\r\nchair. Come and look.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _II._\r\n\r\nTogether they crept up. The room door was ajar, and they noiselessly\r\nentered what was evidently a sitting-room. Needham sat in a large\r\narmchair, with his back to the window, sleeping quietly. A reading lamp\r\non the table was the sole source of illumination, and, since it was\r\nfitted with a heavy red shade, the upper portion of the chamber was in\r\ncomparative darkness.\r\n\r\nThe full light of the lamp, however, fell upon the form of the sleeping\r\nman, who had sunk low in his chair and was indeed in an extraordinary\r\nattitude. His book had fallen to the floor, and his long arms hung over\r\nthe sides of the chair, the hands resting palm upwards on the rug. His\r\nhuge thighs sloped upward from the depths of the chair to the point\r\nmade by his knees, and his long shins disappeared below the table.\r\n\r\nNorton glanced at Meldrum, who was looking at the sleeper curiously.\r\n\r\n“Ho, Needham!” said Norton, loudly. “Wake up!”\r\n\r\nThe slumberer was roused at last, but in a startling manner. With a\r\nlightning movement, he sat bolt upright and clutched the arms of the\r\nchair, his features working convulsively, while a stream of horrible\r\ngibberish, delivered in a high piercing tone, burst from his lips.\r\nNorton went as pale as death, while Meldrum remained rooted to the spot\r\nwhere he stood.\r\n\r\nThen, recovering himself, Norton ran forward and, seizing Needham by\r\nthe arm, shook him violently, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Needham! It’s only Norton come to see you.”\r\n\r\nThe man in the chair regained his composure as quickly as he had lost\r\nit, and, as if unaware that anything unusual had happened, got to his\r\nfeet and said:\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Norton, old chap! Take a seat. I must have fallen asleep and\r\nhad some beastly dream or something. Sit down.”\r\n\r\nHe crossed to the wall near the fireplace and switched on some lights\r\nthat illuminated the whole room. Then, seeing Meldrum for the first\r\ntime, he advanced toward him and shook hands.\r\n\r\n“It’s not quite the right thing to steal into a man’s house in this\r\nway, I know,” said Meldrum. “I am sorry if we startled you. We rang and\r\nraised a rumpus down below, but without effect. I was taking a walk\r\nwith Norton after the storm, and it occurred to him to come up and see\r\nyou and apologize for his absence this evening. So we came together.”\r\n\r\n“It’s quite all right,” said Needham, in his peculiar nasal tones. “I\r\nam glad you came. I sleep pretty heavily and had a beastly dream just\r\nwhen you came in. I was back in Africa.”\r\n\r\nHe was moving about as he spoke, placing a box of cigars, a bottle\r\nof whisky, some glasses and a siphon of soda-water on the table,\r\nand Meldrum observed him carefully. His peculiar build was not so\r\nnoticeable when he was on his feet, the design of his loose tweed suit\r\nseeming to make him appear better proportioned. At times he looked\r\nalmost handsome, but at other times, with a different perspective, the\r\nextraordinary length of his arms and legs was very apparent, while\r\nstill another view made him appear almost grotesque, the singular shape\r\nof his small head, with its closely-cropped black hair, offending the\r\nsense of just proportions. His eyes were brown with muddy whites,\r\nand the sinister effect of his high cackling laugh (which was very\r\nfrequent), accompanied as it was by a downward movement of his large\r\nhooked nose and an upward twist of his little black mustache, was not\r\nlost upon the observant teacher.\r\n\r\nThe room itself was dirty and untidy in the extreme. Stale tobacco\r\nfumes filled the air, and articles of wearing apparel were scattered\r\naround. Some unwashed dishes stood on a small table near the fireplace,\r\nand remnants of food lay on the floor. Books, papers and magazines were\r\nflung about in disorder and Needham’s huge muddy boots lay where he had\r\nthrown them, below the chair on which Norton sat.\r\n\r\n“What were you doing back in Africa?” asked Meldrum pleasantly, helping\r\nhimself to a cigar.\r\n\r\n“Back amongst those beastly baboons,” said Needham, with his unpleasant\r\nlaugh, at the same time proceeding to fill the glasses. “You know, I\r\nonce ran into a bunch of them when I was out alone on a hunting trip,\r\nand I saw a curious sight. There was a big fight on among them--there\r\nwould be about twenty of them, I should think. I saw the whole\r\nbusiness, and it was some fight, I can tell you. Rocks and chunks of\r\nwood were flying in all directions, and they were clubbing one another\r\nin great shape. As far as I could judge, they were roughly divided into\r\ntwo lots, but it was pretty much of a mix-up.\r\n\r\n“But there was one old gray fellow that took my fancy rather. He seemed\r\nto be the chief egger-on. Whenever things looked like calming down a\r\nbit, he stirred them up again by means of a number of curious calls.\r\nI could not quite make out what part he was playing, or what side he\r\nfavored, for he seemed to keep pretty well outside of the fight, only\r\nconcerning himself with those that went down. He finished them up in\r\nthe most methodical manner as they lay. And if two were attacking one\r\nhe would throw himself in on the side of the two to help finish the\r\nodd fellow--and then he seemed to set the remaining two fighting one\r\nanother. I think he gave false signals at times. At any rate, he was\r\nthe freshest of the three or four survivors when it was all over. And\r\nthen they sat down and had a kind of powwow.”\r\n\r\nNorton glanced again at Meldrum, who smiled at him slightly, then said\r\nto Needham:\r\n\r\n“Really? How very extraordinary that you should witness all this. Did\r\nthey not attempt to molest you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Needham, with his evil smile. “They didn’t attempt to\r\ninterfere with us--didn’t seem to mind me at all, which is rather\r\nunusual for them, for they are shy of humans as a rule. I stood on\r\na big boulder and watched the whole business. The old chap had his\r\neye on me, but either he understood firearms (I had my rifle and\r\nrevolver, of course), or else I was lucky when I imitated some of his\r\npeculiar noises. He seemed quite scared when I came away with one of\r\nhis favorite calls, and when they finally cleared out, after covering\r\nup the dead with branches and leaves, he gave me a most significant\r\nlook--seeming to beg that I would not give him away.\r\n\r\n“At least that’s how it appeared to me. And, strangely enough, I was\r\ninstrumental in capturing the very same animal later on, together with\r\nsome others, during a hunt. I lured them to a certain spot by that very\r\nnoise.”\r\n\r\nHe had thrown himself down in his easy chair again, and as he laughed\r\nafresh his crooked yellow teeth uncovered, and his little eyes\r\nglittered unpleasantly. Meldrum was filled with a strong sense of\r\nrepulsion.\r\n\r\n“What was that particular noise like?” Norton struck in for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNeedham put down his glass and, laying his head back slightly, made a\r\npeculiar kind of clucking gurgle in his throat. In an instant, from\r\nthe corner behind Norton’s chair, came a shrill chatter of terror,\r\nand a little red figure hurried across the floor and dived below the\r\ntable. Norton almost dropped his glass, and Meldrum gave a startled\r\nexclamation. Needham alone was calm.\r\n\r\n“Ah Fifi, you rascal!” he said. “Did I scare you again? That’s too bad.\r\nCome here.”\r\n\r\nA small long-tailed monkey, clad in a little red jacket, came slowly\r\nfrom below the table and advanced timidly toward Needham, who spoke\r\ncoaxingly to it, and finally made a kind of rippling noise with his\r\ntongue that seemed to reassure it, for it jumped on the arm of his\r\nchair and sat quietly blinking at the visitors. Needham tickled its\r\nhead with his large forefinger.\r\n\r\n“I bought Fifi from an Italian,” he said, noting his guests’ look of\r\nastonishment. “She is good company--catches flies, switches the lights\r\non and off, and does other useful things--eh, Fifi?”\r\n\r\nThe little animal looked up at him intelligently, and with a sudden\r\nmovement Needham wound his great fingers about its throat. With a\r\nplaintive cry, the little creature made futile efforts to tear away the\r\nstrong hand about its neck, plucking frantically with its small paws.\r\n\r\n“Don’t!” said Norton in a sharp voice. “I can’t bear to see animals\r\ntormented.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not hurting her,” said Needham, removing his hand. “She’s a\r\nnervous little thing and must be taught not to be so frightened. I\r\nthink the Italian must have ill-used her. But she is clever, for all\r\nthat,” continued Needham, laughing. “She is learning to play the piano.”\r\n\r\nLifting the little monkey, he crossed the room with long strides to the\r\ncorner, where a small cottage piano stood, and seated himself on the\r\nstool. “Now play, Fifi,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent creature leant forward and commenced striking sharply\r\nhere and there among the notes, producing a curious kind of tinkling\r\nresemblance to certain bars from “Old Black Joe”. Meldrum was conscious\r\nof a strange prickling sensation--he did not quite know why.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments, Needham rose again and, putting the monkey in a\r\nbox in the corner of the room, returned again to his chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _III._\r\n\r\nIt was late before the friends took their departure, Needham holding\r\ntheir interest with stories of his adventures in different parts of the\r\nworld. Indeed, it was only when Meldrum became aware, by the restless\r\nmovements of his friend, that Norton was not enjoying himself that he\r\nrecollected the lateness of the hour and suggested it was time they\r\ntook their leave.\r\n\r\n“You fellows mustn’t be too critical of my quarters, you know,” said\r\nNeedham, laughing, as they descended the stairs together. “I confess I\r\nam not a tidy person. I have led the rough bachelor life too long. But\r\nyou fellows should understand something about that.”\r\n\r\nHe accompanied them to the sidewalk, and after some desultory remarks\r\nabout the weather, the visitors set off toward Norton’s home. The moon\r\nwas shining brightly and after the heavy rain and wind the air smelt\r\nfresh and moist. Meldrum inhaled it with evident pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Now that I have seen your friend at close quarters,” he said, “I must\r\nconfess that I do not feel so strongly inclined in his favor. The state\r\nof that room was disgraceful even for a bachelor, and there is no\r\nexcuse for anyone at all shutting out the fresh air. But, although his\r\ntastes seem to run unpleasantly to monkeys, I hardly think he deserves\r\nthe appellation you bestowed on him.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” said Norton, who seemed in better spirits, now that he\r\nwas in the free fresh air again. “As far as the atmosphere of his house\r\nis concerned, he once explained that to me by saying that since he had\r\nbeen in Africa he had to keep the temperature up. I think he said he\r\nhad rheumatism. But I don’t like him.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for several minutes, and then he burst out:\r\n\r\n“And of course he pays attention to Elsie.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Meldrum significantly. “Perhaps a lover’s jealousy has\r\nsomething to do with the case.”\r\n\r\n“We met him one day on Church Street,” said Norton, “and of course I\r\nhad to introduce him. He made himself very agreeable, and yet it seemed\r\nto my fancy that he was not so much taken up with the girl as anxious\r\nto do me an ill turn. Other fellows pay attention to her, too, of\r\ncourse, but that’s because they admire her. It was not so in his case,\r\nI am convinced. After we left him Elsie said: ‘What a fine-looking\r\nman!’ And then she added: ‘No he isn’t--he’s a horror!’”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Meldrum heartily, “apparently you do not need to fear her\r\nfalling in love with him, however it may be in his case. I really am\r\nafraid it’s a case of ‘I do not like thee, Dr. Fell.’” Meldrum laughed.\r\n“But I hardly think,” he wound up, “you have any solid grounds for\r\nquarreling with him. The world is wide enough to hold both of you.”\r\n\r\nOften in the days that followed, Meldrum, moved by a curiosity he\r\ncould not quite account for, took his evening walk out on North Avenue\r\npast Needham’s house. Of Needham himself he saw nothing. Once he heard\r\nthe weird tinkling of the piano, but generally the form of the little\r\nmonkey in its red jacket could be seen sitting motionless at the upper\r\nfront window looking out on the street. It struck Meldrum as strange\r\nthat the creatures should sit so quietly. In the course of his progress\r\npast the house he did not observe it stir or alter its position. Its\r\ngaze seemed fixed on that point of the road where Meldrum fancied its\r\nmaster would first come into sight on his way home from town.\r\n\r\n“Never knew they were such devoted things,” Meldrum ruminated. “What\r\na queer kind of a pet to keep! And what a queer life to live, anyway,\r\nalone in that house. He doesn’t even get anyone to clean it up\r\napparently. Some strange people in this old world!”\r\n\r\nWith this philosophical reflection, Meldrum passed on in the direction\r\nof the park.\r\n\r\nTerm examinations kept Meldrum busily occupied during the days that\r\nfollowed, and the friends did not have occasion to see one another for\r\nnearly two weeks. Then, when they did meet, it was again through the\r\ninstrumentality of Needham, after the evening of the party at the Miner\r\nhome. The Miners were neighbors of Norton’s sweetheart and lived out\r\nsome distance beyond Ethan Allen Park.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that after seeing his young lady to her home Norton\r\nfound himself, some time after midnight, at a point perhaps a couple\r\nof miles from his rooms and with the area of the Park lying almost\r\ndirectly between himself and his objective. He determined to cut across\r\nit, a thing he did quite frequently.\r\n\r\nThe night was cool and cloudy, with fitful bursts of moonlight which\r\ntended rather to accentuate the blackness of the intervening spells of\r\ndarkness. Had Norton not been thoroughly familiar with the topography\r\nof the land he might have had some difficulty in keeping his direction.\r\nBut he kept going forward confidently, noting certain well-known\r\nlandmarks. He skirted the base of the hill on which the tower is\r\nsituated, and was just on the point of plunging into a thick grove of\r\ntrees, leading down toward the main gateway, when he chanced to look\r\nbehind. And there he saw rather a disquieting sight.\r\n\r\nThe moon had just struggled through again and its pale light revealed\r\nto the apprehensive Norton the gigantic form of Needham perched on the\r\ntop of a large boulder in a crouching position as if about to spring\r\ndown. It might have been perhaps fifty yards from the spot where Norton\r\nstood. Even as he gazed Needham leapt down (from a height of some ten\r\nfeet) and disappeared. Norton stood waiting, but there was no further\r\nsound. He walked on again, wondering uneasily what Needham might be\r\ndoing in the park at such an hour--unless perhaps he, too, was taking a\r\nshort cut. But Norton felt uneasy nevertheless.\r\n\r\nEntering the grove he pushed forward briskly. It was very dark now, the\r\nmoon being hidden once more, and the gloom and whispering of the trees\r\nmade his flesh creep. Several times he looked behind him, but could see\r\nnothing. Then a crackling of branches, this time much nearer, brought\r\nhim to a dead halt, and, facing about, he called loudly:\r\n\r\n“Hello, Needham! Is that you?”\r\n\r\nThere was no response, and Norton stood with straining ears and eyes,\r\nhis heart thumping in alarm. And even as he stood the horrible thing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nHe was almost directly under a huge gnarled oak tree, and as he laid a\r\nhand on the trunk for a moment to steady himself he happened to glance\r\nup, and the hair bristled on his scalp to find a pair of luminous\r\nyellow eyes gazing down upon him.\r\n\r\nEre he could recover, a form seemed to detach itself from the shadows\r\nand a pair of great hands reached down and clutched at his throat,\r\nwhile a chuckling voice said:\r\n\r\n“Aha! You would give me away, would you!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _IV._\r\n\r\nIn his terror, Norton did what was possibly the best thing in the\r\ncircumstances--fell to the ground. For this action seemed to upset the\r\nequilibrium of the figure in the tree (which seemed to be suspended\r\nby the lower limbs) and caused it to relax its hold and draw up its\r\narms for an instant. And in that instant Norton had recovered and was\r\noff, running as he had never run before, slipping, dashing, plunging,\r\ncolliding, but never stopping and never looking back.\r\n\r\nHow he ever found his way out to the street was always a mystery to\r\nhim, but he became aware, presently, that he was on North Avenue once\r\nmore, and in the light of the first arc lamp he slowed down and finally\r\nstopped to recover. There was no sign of Needham, although Norton had\r\nheard him crashing along in pursuit.\r\n\r\nEverything was still, and not a soul was in sight. Fear overcoming him\r\nagain, Norton hurried on and did not stop until he was safe in his\r\nroom and had locked the door. But he enjoyed little sleep during the\r\nremainder of that night.\r\n\r\nNext evening Norton hastened to Meldrum’s apartment and poured the\r\nwhole story into his friend’s sympathetic ear.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said excitedly, “I was right about him, after all. He is\r\na throw-back--he came at me from the trees. His instincts drove him\r\nthere. Talking, too, about my giving him away! He knows I know what he\r\nis....”\r\n\r\n“He possibly played a practical joke on you,” said Meldrum cheerily.\r\n“He tried to give you a fright and succeeded. You called him, and he\r\ncame--although not quite in the manner you expected, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Well I am not such a nervous person as all that, either,” said Norton.\r\n“I admit, however, that in sober daylight it does not look quite so\r\nbad. It did not seem like a joke at the time, though. I am convinced he\r\nmeant me harm.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think you are justified in that belief, Harry,” said Meldrum\r\ndecisively. “The man is trying to be friendly to you and you keep\r\nrebuffing him. And as for ‘giving him away’ that’s nonsense, and you\r\nknow it. What have you to give away? Simply that you don’t like him\r\nand have strange ideas about him? That won’t hold water, you know. You\r\nhad better forget your fancies and come along with me and see this new\r\ncircus that has just struck the town. I notice by the placards they\r\nhave some baboons and I am rather curious about the creatures since\r\nhearing Needham’s stories. Come along! You need something to take you\r\nout of yourself. And if I were you I would not mention that business\r\nthe next time you see Needham, unless he broaches the subject....”\r\n\r\nTasker’s, “The Greatest Show on Earth,” had pitched its camp some\r\ndistance from the town over toward Winooski, and after a brisk walk\r\nthe friends found themselves in the enclosure in which the curious\r\nwere beginning to gather. There were the usual games of hazard,\r\ncocoanut shies, roundabouts, candy stalls, and side shows of all kinds\r\nclustered round the main tents where the grand performance was held\r\nlater in the evening. Presently they discovered the whereabouts of the\r\nbaboons, which did not, when viewed, present quite the appearance of\r\nthe monstrous creatures portrayed in vivid colors on the outside of the\r\ntents.\r\n\r\nMeldrum and Norton stood observing the animals in silence for some\r\nmoments when Norton, happening to glance in the direction of the\r\ntent opening, saw the tall form of Needham in the act of paying his\r\nadmission fee. Norton’s heart beat faster with the recollection of his\r\nexperience on the previous evening, but Needham smiled and waved a\r\ngreeting, as if nothing unusual had happened. Norton turned again to\r\nthe cage--to discover that there were others interested in the arrival\r\nof the newcomer.\r\n\r\nThere were three baboons in all, two apparently not yet full grown, and\r\nan old fellow of hoary aspect, who sat by himself for the most part\r\nnear the front of the cage, watching the passers-by. He was treated\r\nwith great respect by the two younger ones and was evidently still\r\nstrong enough to be reckoned with. The old baboon had risen to its feet\r\nand was gazing intently at the approaching figure.\r\n\r\nFor some moments it stood thus, then, seizing the bars of the cage in\r\nits hands, it rattled the framework with tremendous force, at the same\r\ntime giving vent to a peculiar sound. At its cry, the other two ran\r\nforward and the extraordinary spectacle was seen of all three creatures\r\nstaring fixedly at Needham as he made his way toward them.\r\n\r\nThere were not many people in the tent--the hour being early--but the\r\nfew who were there turned toward the spot. Needham laughed and shook\r\nhands with Meldrum, at the same time waving one of his hands playfully\r\nin the direction of the old baboon. Like lightning, a long hairy arm\r\nshot forth toward him, but the distance was too great for the creature.\r\nAgain it thundered on the bars.\r\n\r\n“Hey Kruger, what’s the matter now?” shouted an attendant, approaching.\r\n“Quit that! Do you want to bring the house down?”\r\n\r\nHe struck with a pole at the hands of the animal on the bars, making it\r\nshift them from place to place. But it was not to be driven back, and\r\nit still continued to stare at Needham.\r\n\r\nThe attendant drew away, saying in a sulky tone: “Don’t meddle with the\r\nanimals, please.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, old chap,” said Needham pleasantly. “He wanted to\r\nshake hands with me, but I declined with thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t do nothin’ to annoy him, please,” said the man in surly tones,\r\npreparing to depart. “God knows what might happen if he got loose. He\r\ndid once, and we had a hell of a time. He nearly killed a man.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _did_ he?” said Needham, with interest. “He’s pretty strong, I\r\ntake it?”\r\n\r\n“You can bet your sweet life he is!” the man called back over his\r\nshoulder. “We take no chances with him.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” said Needham, gazing at the baboon. “He’s mighty like the\r\nold fellow in the fight I told you about, now that I look at him\r\nclosely.”\r\n\r\nThe three walked away from the spot at Meldrum’s suggestion, but,\r\nlooking back every now and then, the teacher noted, with some\r\nuneasiness, that the creature still retained its position and still\r\nfollowed Needham’s figure with attentive eyes. There were a few other\r\ncages in the tent containing smaller monkeys and other animals and,\r\nhaving strolled past these, they soon found themselves once more\r\nopposite the baboons.\r\n\r\nThe place was now clearer than before, and Needham, glancing around\r\nto see that he was not observed, made a swift cross-wise motion with\r\nhis hand and emitted the peculiar noise that Meldrum had heard him\r\nmake on the night of their visit. Its effect was electrical. The two\r\nyounger baboons, who had seat themselves near their older companion,\r\nran at once to the back of the cage, where they cowered, whimpering and\r\nexhibiting every indication of alarm.\r\n\r\nBut the old baboon acted differently. The tension, which had up to this\r\npoint kept its figure severely rigid, now relaxed. It squatted down\r\non the floor of the cage and commenced nodding its head briskly up\r\nand down, its features distorted by what, to Meldrum’s fancy, looked\r\nextraordinarily like a grin. Needham smiled, too, and, glancing from\r\none to the other, Meldrum felt his flesh creep slightly.\r\n\r\n“Let us go,” he said hastily. “We have seen enough of these brutes.”\r\n\r\nNeedham acquiesced, and they made their way to the exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _V._\r\n\r\n“Beastly clever things, though,” said Needham, as they passed out into\r\nthe clear night air. “And strong as the very devil. I think myself\r\nthere is something in the old idea of the African natives that apes\r\npretend not to understand speech for fear they should be made to work.”\r\nHe laughed his unpleasant laugh, and again Meldrum felt squeamish.\r\n\r\n“You seem to have given them some study,” said Meldrum, as they made\r\ntheir way toward the main tent.\r\n\r\n“I have seen a good deal of them one way and another,” said Needham\r\ncarelessly, “and read a little, too. A curious thing I discovered\r\nwas that when under the influence of liquor (and it’s some sight to\r\nsee, believe me!) they are peculiarly receptive to autosuggestion. I\r\nbelieve a fortune could be made by putting them through tricks in this\r\nway--if the authorities allowed it. As for thieving, they would ‘steal\r\nthe milk out of your tea’ as the old song says.”\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of the extensive and elaborate circus performance\r\nprovided by Tasker’s Needham and Meldrum soon forgot about the baboons,\r\nand it was late in the evening when the three made their way back to\r\nBurlington. Emerging from Church Street, Norton and Meldrum turned up\r\ntoward the University, while Needham strode off in the direction of the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n“Better lay aside your prejudice and think the best of the man,” said\r\nMeldrum to Norton as they parted. “He is a mighty interesting fellow,\r\nand has a fund of knowledge that is remarkable.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later found all Burlington in a state of excitement. Through\r\na piece of carelessness the door of the baboon’s cage had been left\r\nunlocked and the old gray baboon had made a successful dash for liberty\r\nand got clear away. It happened in the evening, and the fading light\r\nhampered pursuit. When last seen, the brute was heading away from\r\nWinooski toward the lake shore.\r\n\r\nSearch was kept up throughout the night without result, and then, next\r\nday, word came that the creature had been seen in a tree near the\r\nentrance to Ethan Allen Park. As soon as possible the entire park was\r\nsurrounded, and a contracting circle of hunters and curious people\r\nscoured the woods and shrubbery, but apparently the animal had moved on\r\nagain to fresh quarters.\r\n\r\nWord was sent all over the surrounding countryside, and no effort was\r\nspared to locate the missing animal, but several days passed without\r\nresult. Numerous stories got into circulation regarding supposed\r\nescapades on the part of the missing baboon, and there were no end\r\nof rumors as to its being seen--at one time on the railway near the\r\nfreight yard, at another waving from the tower in the park; and, again,\r\nfar along the lake shore. Nervous persons kept to busy thoroughfares\r\nafter dark. But the actual whereabouts of the creature remained a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nFresh stories went around of stealthy prowlings round houses and\r\nmysterious rattling of doors in the small hours of the morning.\r\nChancing to see some of this in one of the evening papers, Meldrum’s\r\nattention was again drawn to the subject, and there returned to his\r\nmind his encounter with Needham at the circus. Obeying a sudden\r\nimpulse, he set off in the direction of Needham’s dwelling in North\r\nAvenue. He had not been near it for some time, but he found himself\r\npossessed of a curious desire to see whether the little monkey still\r\nsat looking out of the front window.\r\n\r\nWalking sharply, Meldrum soon came in view of the quaint wooden house\r\nwith its trees and grass plots. The sun had not yet set, and in the\r\nclear evening light Meldrum could see the small crouching figure\r\nsitting in its accustomed place. He stopped, as he reached the house,\r\nand stood watching a moment, and then, suddenly became petrified with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nFor there came all at once into view, over and beyond the head of the\r\nsmall monkey, the great gray face of the old baboon with its long lips\r\ncurled back and its doglike tusks displayed!\r\n\r\nIt gazed forth for an instant, seeming to hold back with one hand the\r\nlace curtain that overhung the window, and then disappeared as suddenly\r\nas it had come. Meldrum rubbed his eyes, then continued staring\r\nstupidly. The little monkey made no sign.\r\n\r\nThinking that perhaps the baboon had found its way into the house\r\nthrough an open window during Needham’s absence, Meldrum felt that\r\nhe ought to warn the South African, without delay, of his unpleasant\r\nvisitor. He went up the path to the house and rang the bell. He thought\r\nthat at the sound he detected a far off scampering, but no one came in\r\nanswer to his summons. He tried the door and found it locked.\r\n\r\nIn some perplexity, Meldrum came down the garden path to the sidewalk,\r\nwondering exactly what course to pursue. He looked again at the window.\r\nThe little monkey still sat gazing intently at the street. Of the\r\nbaboon there was no sign.\r\n\r\n“It may have been imagination,” mused Meldrum. “But it looked\r\nuncommonly real.”\r\n\r\nHe had turned his steps back in the direction of the town, and was\r\nmeditating whether or not to communicate his fears to the authorities,\r\nwhen to his relief he saw the tall figure of Needham striding toward\r\nhim. They stopped to greet one another, and Meldrum hastened to tell\r\nthe other what he had seen.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nonsense!” said Needham, his moustache twitching. “They don’t come\r\naround houses like that--not in the day time, anyway. The place was all\r\nright at midday and has been locked up tight ever since. No; you must\r\nhave imagined it.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed lightly, and in a subconscious kind of way Meldrum seemed\r\nto get the impression that the tall man was more anxious to laugh\r\nthe story off than to continue to discuss it. However, he offered to\r\naccompany Needham home and help search the house.\r\n\r\n“Just wait there for a moment if you don’t mind,” said Needham (again\r\nwith nervous haste, it seemed to Meldrum) “and I’ll walk around and\r\nhave a look at the windows. If they are all right I’ll give you a wave.”\r\n\r\nHe hastened off, and after a short interval again made his appearance\r\nat the front of the house and waved his hand. Meldrum waved back.\r\n\r\n“Everything O. K.?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Quite O. K.,” called Needham. “So long, old man. See you later.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat puzzled, Meldrum set off in the direction of the town.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the next day the telephone in Meldrum’s sitting room\r\ntinkled briskly and Norton’s voice came over the line.\r\n\r\n“Needham has just ’phoned down,” he said, “and has asked me to go round\r\nto his place tonight to get some old African stamps he has hunted out\r\nfor me. I once asked him if he had any and he promised to get me some.\r\nI wish now that I hadn’t asked him.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed rather nervously, and then added:\r\n\r\n“I wish I’d just said ‘no,’ for I don’t much want to go. However I\r\npromised to look in for a few minutes. Would you care to come along if\r\nI come round for you?”\r\n\r\n“Too busy with examination papers just at the moment,” said Meldrum,\r\n“and it would bring you out of your way to come over here. It’s after\r\neight o’clock now. I might be free about ten and pick you up when I\r\ntake my usual stroll. How would that do?”\r\n\r\nNorton said, “All right,” and Meldrum hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, a strange sense of foreboding came upon him and the\r\nvision of the baboon rushed back to his mind. He shook himself in\r\nannoyance and resumed his work.\r\n\r\nBut he could not regain his ease of mind, and after spending nearly an\r\nhour in a vain attempt to concentrate on some problems in algebra he\r\nclosed up his books impatiently and sought his hat and coat.\r\n\r\nHe stood irresolutely in the hallway for some moments, and then, with a\r\nlaugh, opened a drawer and drew forth a revolver, which he slipped into\r\nhis overcoat pocket, after seeing that all its chambers were filled.\r\nHe laughed again as he descended to the street, but drew some comfort,\r\nnevertheless, from the touch of the cold steel upon his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _VI._\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, but the air was clear and invigorating. Meldrum\r\nwalked smartly in a direction away from Needham’s residence, since\r\nhe was earlier than usual and had but plenty of time to meet Norton.\r\nFinding that he could not free his mind from an unaccountable anxiety,\r\nhe swung round presently and made his way to North Avenue.\r\n\r\nIt did not take him long to reach the house, and as he drew near he\r\nobserved, with a slight feeling of surprise, that one of the downstairs\r\nrooms was illuminated--a room he had never yet seen lighted. It lay\r\ntoward the rear of the house, its windows facing a broad gallery.\r\n\r\nObeying a sudden impulse, Meldrum, instead of going to the front door,\r\nwalked quietly along the gallery and peeped through a corner of the\r\nblind into the room. What he saw there made his blood run cold.\r\n\r\nThe room was about fifteen feet square, with blue paper on the walls\r\nand plain oak furniture. A square table stood in the center at which\r\nseveral figures were seated. Needham sat with his back to the window,\r\nand in the chair on his left sat Norton, a pile of postage stamps on\r\nthe table before him, and over opposite Needham, directly facing the\r\nwindow, sat, or rather sprawled, the figure of the gray baboon!\r\n\r\nOn the table was a decanter of whisky, and all three had tumblers.\r\nNorton’s glass was half empty, standing beside the postage stamps,\r\nbut Needham and the creature were both drinking, the animal seemingly\r\nfollowing the movements of the man, lifting the tumbler to its lips and\r\nsetting it down again as Needham did, as far as Meldrum could judge by\r\nthe movements of his right arm, which was visible. The brute’s eyes\r\nwere fixed upon the man across the table, and from its appearance and\r\nthe limpness of its figure Meldrum decided it was in an advanced state\r\nof intoxication.\r\n\r\nNorton seemed to be spellbound, staring fixedly at the scene before\r\nhim. Occasionally he passed his hand in a bewildered way over his\r\nforehead, or looked stupidly at the half empty tumbler before him. But\r\nhe seemed incapable of either speech or action.\r\n\r\nIn horror and indignation, Meldrum continued to gaze. As fast as\r\nthe baboon’s whisky was gulped down Needham filled its glass again.\r\nFrom the fact that he did not fill his own very frequently, Meldrum\r\nconcluded that he did not drink every time he pretended to do\r\nso--apparently deceiving the befuddled creature.\r\n\r\nLike a flash, Meldrum remembered Needham’s remark about the intoxicated\r\nbaboon and autosuggestion. And with a fast beating heart he gripped his\r\nrevolver and waited.\r\n\r\nFrom being limp and sluggish, the ape now began to show signs\r\nof animation. It sat more erect, its eyes began to glitter, and\r\noccasionally it turned its head and gazed at Norton who still sat in\r\napparent stupefaction. Every time it did this it seemed to grin at\r\nNeedham with frightful suggestiveness, nodding its head as it had done\r\nwhen in the cage at the menagerie.\r\n\r\nFearing he knew not what mischief, Meldrum went quietly and hurriedly\r\nto the front door, opened it with extreme caution, and managed to make\r\nhis way undetected to the door of the room in which the trio sat.\r\nThrough the half open doorway, he could now get a view of Needham’s\r\nface, and its diabolical contortions were dreadful to behold. It was\r\napparent that he was working the animal up to something, but what that\r\nsomething was the creature apparently did not quite seem to grasp.\r\n\r\nPresently Needham made the strange clucking noise in his throat, at the\r\nsame time stretching out his arms toward Norton. That gave the brute\r\nits clue. It rose unsteadily to its feet, and turning its evil eyes\r\ntoward the recumbent figure of Norton, seemed about to spring at his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nWith a crash, Meldrum kicked open the door and entered the room,\r\ncovering Needham with his revolver. The baboon, its attention\r\ndistracted by the noise of Meldrum’s entry and apparently finding\r\nNeedham’s influence withdrawn, now appeared to feel the full effect\r\nof the whisky fumes once more, and sank back into the armchair more\r\nfuddled than ever. Norton had by this time fallen back in his seat, his\r\nhead tilted toward the ceiling. Needham, however, has his wits about\r\nhim, and his ghastly yellow face, convulsed with fury, attempted to\r\nforce a sickly smile.\r\n\r\n“Needham,” said Meldrum sternly, “I don’t know what abominable deviltry\r\nyou are up to, but it must stop here and now. If you can right things\r\nhere go ahead. If not, I shoot--either you or the brute, I am not\r\nparticular which.”\r\n\r\nAlthough outwardly calm, Meldrum’s heart was beating furiously and he\r\nwas hunting desperately in his mind for the proper way to handle the\r\nsituation. It was not clear to him as yet.\r\n\r\n“Why, Meldrum!” said Needham in a thick voice, cunningly feigning\r\ndrunkenness, although he was perfectly sober. “What’s all this?\r\nRevolvers? We are all friends. Norton had a drop too much--old man\r\nbaboon dropped in and joined the party--I was going to get him to do\r\nsome tricks....”\r\n\r\n“That’s quite enough,” said Meldrum sharply. “You are no more drunk\r\nthan I am. Open that window and let Norton have some air. Loosen his\r\ncollar--”\r\n\r\nA sudden chattering caused him to pause and drew his attention for a\r\nmoment to the mantel over the fireplace, on to which the little monkey\r\nhad suddenly jumped from some nearby corner.\r\n\r\n“Ha, Fifi!” said Needham quickly. “Lights!” The switch was within easy\r\nreach of the creature’s hand, and in an instant the room was plunged in\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe hallway being also without illumination, the blackness was\r\nprofound. Utterly unable to tell what might happen, and fearing the\r\nbaboon to be the principal danger point, Meldrum came to a swift\r\ndecision and fired in the direction of the creature’s chair. A\r\nfrightful scream broke the silence followed by a wild gibbering,\r\npunctuated at times by what appeared to be Needham’s voice shouting\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nThen there came a loud crash of glass, as the table was overturned,\r\nfollowed by snarling, cursing and pandemonium. Stumbling blindly in the\r\ndarkness, Meldrum endeavored, without success, to locate the switch in\r\nthe hallway, but finally a faint glimmer showed him the outline of the\r\nfront door, and he dashed forth into the street.\r\n\r\nSeveral people had collected on hearing the shot, and aid was quickly\r\nforthcoming. Together with several neighbors and others, Meldrum again\r\nentered the house, and the light in the hall was turned on. The door\r\nof the occupied room had been swung shut and the dreadful snarling din\r\nstill continued.\r\n\r\n“The baboon must have broken in and attacked my friends,” was Meldrum’s\r\nhurried explanation, as they forced open the room door and finally got\r\nthe lights turned on.\r\n\r\nA hideous litter of broken furniture, pieces of glass, liquor, and\r\nbloodstains were everywhere revealed. Needham and the baboon, locked\r\nin a death grapple, were rolling among the ruins. By a curious chance,\r\nNorton’s chair had been left standing, and he still sat there, limp and\r\nmotionless, unaffected by all the noise.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty, the baboon was overpowered and secured. It was still\r\nbleeding copiously from the bullet wound in its shoulder, but it\r\ngnashed and tore at its captors with undiminished fury. Needham was\r\nbleeding from many wounds and presented a dreadful spectacle, much of\r\nhis clothing being torn to shreds. In addition to receiving many cuts,\r\nhe had been badly mauled by the infuriated animal, whose wrath, by some\r\nstrange combination of circumstances, had been turned against himself.\r\nHe sat breathing heavily, too exhausted to talk to those around him.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the animal drew off most of the curious and some sort of\r\norder was restored. Realizing that Norton had apparently been drugged,\r\nbut not wishing just then to say anything of what he had seen, Meldrum\r\nmade the plea that his friend had evidently been overcome as a result\r\nof the terrible scene he had just witnessed, and, procuring a cab,\r\ntook him first to his own chambers and then to his home, where he was\r\nprostrated for some weeks as the result of the shock.\r\n\r\nNeedham disappeared almost immediately, and Norton’s relatives did not\r\ndeem it expedient to search for him. He was never heard of again in\r\nthat city, and later it transpired that he had returned to Africa.\r\n\r\nThe baboon lived for some years after its strange adventure, but on\r\ndying it made no confession. And such mysteries as to how long it had\r\nbeen the guest of the South African, whether or not it was the same\r\ncreature that he had once betrayed into captivity, to what extent the\r\ntwo understood one another, and whether or not it was incited to murder\r\non that dreadful evening, were never solved.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, nobody had any great desire that they should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The Eyrie\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIRD TALES is not merely “another new magazine.” It’s a brand new type\r\nof new magazine--a sensational variation from the established rules\r\nthat are supposed to govern magazine publishing.\r\n\r\nWEIRD TALES, in a word, is unique. In no other publication will you\r\nfind the sort of stories that WEIRD TALES offers in this issue--and\r\nwill continue to offer in the issues to come. Such stories are tabooed\r\nelsewhere. We do not know why. People like to read this kind of\r\nfiction. There’s no gainsaying that. Nor does the moral question of\r\n“good taste” present an obstacle. At any rate, the stories in this\r\nissue of WEIRD TALES will not offend one’s moral sense, nor will the\r\nstories we’ve booked for subsequent issues. Some of them may horrify\r\nyou: and others, perhaps, will make you gasp at their outlandish\r\nimagery: but none, we think, will leave you any the worse for having\r\nread it.\r\n\r\nWe do believe, however, that these stories will cause you to forget\r\nyour surroundings--remove your mind from the humdrum affairs of the\r\nworkaday world--and provide you with exhilarating diversion. And, after\r\nall, isn’t that the fundamental purpose of fiction?\r\n\r\nOur stories are unlike any you have ever read--or perhaps ever will\r\nread--in the other magazines. They are unusual, uncanny, unparalleled.\r\nWe have no space in WEIRD TALES for the “average magazine story.”\r\nUnless a story is an extraordinary thing, we won’t consider it.\r\n\r\nIf the letters we have already received, and are still receiving (weeks\r\nbefore the magazine goes to press), are an augury of success, then\r\nWEIRD TALES is on the threshold of a tremendously prosperous career.\r\nSome of these letters are accompanied by subscriptions, others request\r\nadvertising rates and specimen copies; all predict great things for\r\nus and express enthusiastic anticipation of “something different” in\r\nmagazine fiction.\r\n\r\nAnthony M. Rud, whose amazing novelette, “Ooze,” appears in this issue,\r\nwrote to us as follows:\r\n\r\n “Dear Mr. Baird: Delighted to hear that you contemplate WEIRD TALES!\r\n I hope you put it through--and without compromise. Stories of horror,\r\n of magic, of hypernatural experience, strike home zestfully to nine\r\n readers out of ten. There is no other magazine of this sort. Yarns\r\n somewhat of the type published in book form--for instance, ‘The Grim\r\n Thirteen’--invariably are recommended from one reader to a fellow,\r\n with gusto.\r\n\r\n “WEIRD TALES need not be immoral in slightest degree. Fact, ninety\r\n from one hundred generally contain wholesome moral, at least,\r\n derivable. Even studies of paranoia or fear hysteria, pure and simple,\r\n generally are clean from start to finish. The Poe type of yarn\r\n invariably makes me shiver--and then for a week I prefer the grape-nut\r\n road, shunning the dark places after curfew. But I come back avidly\r\n for more shock!\r\n\r\n “I wrote a story ’way back in college days, which three editors have\r\n proclaimed the best horror yarn they have read. The story I have with\r\n me now. It has been most thoroughly declined--and now, myself, I see\r\n many amateurish spots. I cherish the yarn, however, for of all the\r\n millions of published words I have written I consider this idea and\r\n its development my most finished work.\r\n\r\n “I’ll write that story for you--thus far called ‘The Square of\r\n Canvas’--again from start to finish, and polish it as I would polish\r\n a jewel. The amount of money involved is no spur; I’d like to have it\r\n printed, even gratis. My honest hunch is that, when all is said and\r\n done, you’ll like this yarn as well as any of your choice five.\r\n\r\n “Please put me down as a subscriber to the new magazine. I am buried\r\n deep in the heart of piney woods, 36 miles from the nearest news-stand\r\n selling even a Sunday paper, and I want to make sure of seeing each\r\n issue of WEIRD TALES.\r\n\r\n “It’s a corking title, and it will get all the boosting I can give.\r\n Herewith a clipping of my last platform appearance. I told ’em of the\r\n coming magazine, and that it offered a field of reading unique. At\r\n Atlanta and Montgomery, where I speak later in the winter, I’ll give\r\n the sheet a hand. I have two more dates in Mobile, and I’ll mention\r\n your project.\r\n\r\n “In a month or so I’ll fix up ‘A Square of Canvas’ and shoot it in for\r\n consideration for WEIRD TALES.”\r\n\r\nWe got “A Square of Canvas” and promptly read it--and it will appear\r\nin the next issue of WEIRD TALES. Don’t miss it! It’s all that Mr. Rud\r\nsays it is, and more besides! It’s a terrifying, hair-raising tale, and\r\nno mistake! It’s a bear! You can read it in twenty minutes, but those\r\ntwenty minutes will fairly bristle!\r\n\r\nOf “The Dead Man’s Tale,” which opens this issue, Willard E. Hawkins\r\nwrote us:\r\n\r\n “...The idea for that story came to me in a flash one evening\r\n when my wife and I were returning from the theatre. I outlined the\r\n whole thing to her, and followed that outline without deviation in\r\n writing the story later. It struck me that I had never seen the\r\n Dr.-Jekyll-and-Mr.-Hyde type of situation developed from the point of\r\n the obsessing entity, and I was fascinated by the attempt to do it.”\r\n\r\nAnd we think you’ll agree that Mr. Hawkins did a mighty fine job.\r\n\r\nWe assume you’ve read the stories in this, our first issue, before\r\narriving upon this page back here, and we are eager to know what you\r\nthink of them. Why not write and tell us? Mention the stories you\r\nliked, and those you didn’t like, and tell us what you think of our\r\nattempt to do something new and different in the magazine field. We\r\nshall be delighted to hear from you; and we will print your letters on\r\nthis page--unless you decree otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf you get the next issue of WEIRD TALES--as we hope you will--you’ll\r\nread some strange and remarkable stories. Elsewhere in this number\r\nwe’ve told you something about these stories, and we need only add here\r\nthat each is a striking example of unusual fiction. Whatever effect\r\nthey may have upon you--whether they make you shudder or set your\r\nnerves tingling pleasurably--we can emphatically promise you this:\r\n\r\nYou will not be bored!\r\n\r\n                                                         THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                     Get Ready _For a Big Pay Job_\r\n\r\n                       _Be an_ Electrical Expert\r\n\r\n                       _Earn $75 to $200 a Week_\r\n\r\n\r\nMen like you are needed right now to fill big-paying jobs in the\r\nelectrical field.

A few years of married life rub the bloom off.\r\nChildren come, too many. And instead of the energetic, healthy girl\r\nwe have a tired and bedraggled young-old woman. Why do women allow\r\nmarriage, the holy thing, to work this wicked transformation?\r\n\r\nMARGARET SANGER, the acknowledged world leader of the Birth Control\r\nmovement and President of the American Birth Control League, has the\r\nanswer for this most momentous problem of womankind. Every married\r\nwoman knows only too well the tragedies resulting from ignorance of\r\nbirth control.\r\n\r\nWhy should a woman sacrifice her love-life--a possession she otherwise\r\nuses every resource to keep? Why does she give birth to a rapid\r\nsuccession of children, if she has neither the means to provide for\r\nthem nor the physical strength properly to care for them?\r\n\r\nIn her daring and startling book Margaret Sanger gives to the women of\r\nthe world the knowledge she dared to print--the knowledge for which\r\nshe faced jail and fought through every court to establish as woman’s\r\ninalienable right to know.\r\n\r\nIn “Woman and the New Race” she shows how woman can and will rise\r\nabove the forces that, in too many cases, have ruined her beauty\r\nthrough the ages--that still drag her down today--that wreck her\r\nmental and physical strength--that disqualify her for society, for\r\nself-improvement--that finally shut her out from the thing she\r\ncherishes most: her husband’s love.\r\n\r\n +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                     PARTIAL LIST OF CONTENTS                    |\r\n |                                                                 |\r\n | * Woman’s Error and Her Debt.                                   |\r\n | Two Classes of Women.                                           |\r\n | Cries of Despair.                                               |\r\n | * When Should a Woman Avoid Having Children?                    |\r\n | Birth Control--A Parent’s Problem or Woman’s.                   |\r\n | * Continence--is it Practicable or Desirable?                   |\r\n | * Are Preventive Means Certain?                                 |\r\n | * Contraceptives or Abortion?                                   |\r\n | Women and the New Morality.                                     |\r\n | Legislating Women’s Morals.                                     |\r\n | Why Not Birth Control Clinics in America?                       |\r\n | Progress We have Made.                                          |\r\n |                                                                 |\r\n | * Any one of these chapters alone is worth many times the price |\r\n | of the book.                                                    |\r\n +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nIn blazing this revolutionary trail to the new freedom of women, this\r\ndaring and heroic author points out that women who cannot afford to\r\nhave more than one or two children, should not do so. It is a crime to\r\nherself, a crime to her children, a crime to society. And now for the\r\nfirst time Mrs. Sanger shows the way out. And she brings to the women\r\nof the world the greatest message it has been their good fortune to\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n“Woman and the New Race” is a book that will be read wherever womankind\r\nstruggles with the ever-present danger of too many children. It is a\r\nstartling, mighty revelation of a new truth, a work that will open the\r\neyes of tired, worn womankind. It can with truth and honesty be called\r\nwoman’s salvation.\r\n\r\nEvery woman in the country should have a copy of this remarkable and\r\ncourageous work. For this reason we have arranged a special edition of\r\n“Woman and the New Race” at only $2.00 a copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Send No Money\r\n\r\nThe book is bound in handsome durable gray cloth, has artistic black\r\nlettering and is printed from large type on good paper.
